00:17.640 - 00:18.680:  Wait, where'd you park the car?
00:18.860 - 00:20.420:  Oh, the one I just sold to Carvana.
00:20.560 - 00:20.820:  What?
00:21.000 - 00:21.800:  When did you do that?
00:21.960 - 00:25.320:  When you were still looking at the menu, I went on Carvana.com and all I had to do was

00:33.960 - 00:34.500:  on the spot.
00:34.620 - 00:36.140:  Oh, no wonder you picked up the check.
00:36.320 - 00:37.060:  Yeah, about that.
00:37.060 - 00:38.460:  Don't we're going to have these.

01:26.660 - 01:30.120:  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:30.300 - 01:37.120:  I'm Janet Joliel and in the early hours of Friday the 28th of July, these are our main
01:37.120 - 01:37.640:  stories.
01:38.320 - 01:42.380:  The head of the UN says data showing this month will almost certainly be the hottest
01:42.380 - 01:46.100:  on record represents a disaster for the entire planet.
01:46.800 - 01:51.580:  President Biden has announced measures to help ease the effects of an intense heat wave
01:51.580 - 01:52.880:  in the United States.
01:54.140 - 01:58.860:  Russia's leader Vladimir Putin has acknowledged there's been a significant increase in fighting
01:58.860 - 02:00.060:  in southern Ukraine.
02:02.960 - 02:08.640:  Also in this podcast, unfortunately the DNH has not survived because of this harsh soil
02:08.640 - 02:09.340:  environment.
02:09.340 - 02:13.100:  So luckily for us, though, we have this emerging technique.
02:13.980 - 02:20.120:  How analysing a 2,000 year old skeleton's teeth helped to shed new light on the role
02:20.120 - 02:22.380:  of women in prehistoric Britain?
02:26.560 - 02:28.700:  It's no longer global warming.
02:28.700 - 02:31.700:  We're now in an era of global boiling.
02:32.160 - 02:34.780:  That was a stark warning from the United Nations.
02:35.400 - 02:41.200:  It came amid data showing this month is virtually certain to be the hottest ever recorded.
02:41.860 - 02:48.300:  So hot in fact that researchers are confident the 2019 record will be broken, even with
02:48.300 - 02:49.480:  several days to go.
02:50.160 - 02:56.900:  Some experts believe that July might well be the warmest month in the past 120,000 years.
02:57.700 - 03:02.500:  The UN Secretary-General Anton Yukaterish said the news spelled disaster for the whole
03:02.660 - 03:03.020:  planet.
03:03.660 - 03:06.320:  The consequences are clear and they are tragic.
03:07.420 - 03:15.220:  Children swept away by monsoon rains, families running from the flames, workers collapsing
03:15.220 - 03:16.520:  in scorching heat.
03:17.840 - 03:22.180:  For vast parts of North America, Asia, Africa and Europe, it's a cruel summer.
03:23.280 - 03:25.960:  For the entire planet, it is a disaster.
03:27.220 - 03:29.560:  And for scientists, it is unequivocal.
03:30.160 - 03:31.540:  Humans are to blame.
03:32.420 - 03:36.540:  All this is entirely consistent with predictions and repeated warnings.
03:37.660 - 03:40.800:  The only surprise is the speed of the change.
03:41.560 - 03:43.160:  Climate change is here.
03:43.840 - 03:46.940:  It is terrifying and it is just the beginning.
03:47.760 - 03:52.580:  Our climate reporter, Esni Salad, told us more about his apocalyptic warning.
03:53.100 - 03:57.560:  Yutairas didn't pull any punches when he laid out the devastating impacts we have seen
03:57.560 - 04:03.480:  over the last month of climate change, but he also warned that this is more to come.
04:04.000 - 04:08.520:  When he used this speech, he acted to call on many countries to do more to tackle climate
04:08.520 - 04:13.560:  change, particularly richenations, to give more money to help countries protect themselves
04:13.560 - 04:16.600:  from some of those devastating consequences he spoke of.
04:16.740 - 04:21.540:  And this comes as we are expecting what the hottest July on record after the hottest
04:21.540 - 04:22.440:  June on record.
04:22.680 - 04:23.060:  Exactly.
04:23.140 - 04:27.300:  We're still a couple days off from the end of July, but because the temperatures we've
04:27.300 - 04:32.840:  seen are so extreme, then the WMO, the World Meteorological Organization and their partners
04:32.840 - 04:35.060:  Copernicus are almost completely certain.
04:35.060 - 04:40.800:  This will be the hottest month on record and the hottest July that we have ever seen since
04:40.800 - 04:46.440:  records began, but they also said looking at historical data that goes back tens of thousands
04:46.480 - 04:50.540:  of years from things like sea ice, they think this has been the hottest month we would
04:50.540 - 04:52.700:  have seen in hundreds of thousands of years.
04:53.140 - 04:56.400:  But despite this, is there the International will to act?
04:57.080 - 05:02.040:  Well, we have seen significant progress in terms of switching away from things like fossil
05:02.040 - 05:08.340:  fuels to renewable energy, but as Antoni Yutairas pointed out, some of those countries haven't
05:08.340 - 05:13.080:  done enough when it comes to giving money towards tackling climate change and also reducing
05:13.140 - 05:15.860:  their emissions in the UK.
05:15.860 - 05:21.660:  We've signed some pullback from those commitments, but the countries like the US have pressed on
05:21.660 - 05:23.640:  ahead with their inflation reduction act.
05:23.980 - 05:28.880:  Europe is committed to more renewable energy and China is building more offshore wind farms
05:28.880 - 05:29.620:  than ever before.
05:29.620 - 05:34.640:  So in some sense, there is positive news, but I think there is disagreement about whether
05:34.640 - 05:35.520:  it is quick enough.
05:35.920 - 05:41.300:  So there will be a lot of pressure on countries at the next climate summit, which will be held
05:41.300 - 05:42.600:  towards the end of this year.
05:43.220 - 05:49.580:  What does this all mean for that agreement that was signed back in 2015 in Paris by nearly
05:49.900 - 05:54.580:  200 countries to try to take more action to keep temperatures below a certain level?
05:55.040 - 06:00.560:  So back in 2015, all countries agreed to keep global average temperature rise below two
06:00.560 - 06:03.340:  degrees and try and keep it below 1.5 degrees.
06:03.900 - 06:08.540:  This hottest month that we are now going to see means that we will have reached that, even
06:08.540 - 06:14.420:  if temporarily, so that does call into question whether we can still achieve that goal.
06:14.920 - 06:19.820:  It does put a lot of pressure on COP28, but potentially it is hoped that some of the
06:19.820 - 06:24.940:  experiences over the summer so far will really help to focus leaders' minds on the task
06:24.940 - 06:25.520:  in hand.
06:26.200 - 06:26.980:  Esmeralad.
06:27.480 - 06:31.820:  Well, the extreme heat has led to wildfires breaking out across the Mediterranean region
06:31.820 - 06:33.940:  in Algeria, Greece and Italy.
06:34.380 - 06:39.040:  Our reporter, Azaday Mishiri, is in one of the worst affected areas, the Greek island
06:39.040 - 06:39.760:  of roads.
06:40.280 - 06:45.900:  So much of these buildings and these businesses that represent people's livelihoods have
06:45.900 - 06:47.020:  been scorched.
06:47.400 - 06:51.760:  And that's what the people of roads, the locals we speak to, are so concerned about, is
06:51.760 - 06:53.620:  what does it mean for their future?
06:54.060 - 06:59.580:  Of course, this extreme heat, the dry heat, the winds mean that they're worried that all
06:59.580 - 07:01.280:  this could continue.
07:01.700 - 07:07.100:  When I spoke to the fire service earlier, he said, every day we hunt fires, the officials
07:07.100 - 07:10.780:  and ministers have been saying that they're at war, that this is a battle, and because
07:10.780 - 07:16.200:  that's what it feels like, every day they're fighting a minimum of 65 fires a day.
07:16.200 - 07:21.080:  Sometimes it goes upwards towards 80, and so that's why you'll hear helicopters and
07:21.080 - 07:27.960:  planes above you consistently, because these fires spread, the winds are strong and the
07:28.000 - 07:32.460:  predictions that you're hearing are firstly that they're not sure, that's the terrifying
07:32.460 - 07:35.720:  thing, is that sometimes they're just not sure how this will progress.
07:36.480 - 07:40.260:  But they keep saying that though this isn't affecting all of Greece, this is localised,
07:40.700 - 07:46.700:  the risk of these fires continuing in these areas of southern roads, for example, and on
07:46.700 - 07:49.520:  the mainland as well, those risks aren't over.
07:50.860 - 07:52.600:  Let's look at the situation in Italy.
07:52.600 - 07:56.860:  Sophia Batista reports from Radio Calabria in the south of the country.
07:57.420 - 08:03.700:  This year, the heat wave has been so long and so intense that firefighters are struggling.
08:04.400 - 08:09.360:  They've had to battle nearly 2,000 fires in the last few days.
08:09.940 - 08:13.200:  This region of Italy is famous for its nature.
08:13.720 - 08:16.320:  Now it's completely burned to the ground.
08:16.460 - 08:17.940:  Now we spoke to a woman.
08:17.940 - 08:24.000:  She told us that within seconds her home was engulfed by the flame and that it was terrifying.
08:24.760 - 08:31.820:  Now her family managed to get to safety, but several people in southern Italy have died
08:31.820 - 08:34.840:  trapped in their homes because of the fires.
08:35.480 - 08:43.080:  So on Thursday, the Italian government introduced emergency measures to try and help families
08:43.080 - 08:48.480:  and businesses who have been severely hit by the bad weather.
08:48.920 - 08:55.100:  But the fear here in southern Italy is that the scorching temperatures and the strong winds
08:55.420 - 09:00.660:  could cause more wildfires and that could lead to more loss of life.
09:01.440 - 09:04.800:  Across the Atlantic, the US is also seeing record temperatures.
09:05.320 - 09:09.860:  On Thursday, President Biden gave examples of the impact they have been having on more
09:09.860 - 09:12.180:  than 100 million Americans.
09:13.060 - 09:16.780:  Americans like a lonely woman in Phoenix, who fell out of her wheelchair.
09:17.580 - 09:23.880:  And after 5 minutes on the ground, had 3rd degree burns, or the firefighter who's already
09:24.460 - 09:29.880:  has a logo or 45 pounds of gear through smoke and flame, which is incredibly hot.
09:30.180 - 09:33.500:  The job is even harder and more dangerous to do in record heat.
09:34.340 - 09:39.280:  For the farm workers who have the harvest crops in the dead of night to avoid the high temperatures,
09:39.420 - 09:45.060:  or farmers who risk losing everything they planted for the year, or the construction workers
09:45.060 - 09:48.300:  who literally risk their lives, working all day and blazing heat.
09:48.680 - 09:51.180:  And in some places, don't even have the right to take a water break.
09:51.460 - 09:52.260:  That's outrageous.
09:52.800 - 09:56.980:  President Biden went on to call the soaring temperatures and existential threat
09:57.480 - 10:00.340:  and unveiled several measures to combat climate change.
10:00.940 - 10:03.560:  John Doniston in Washington told us more about them.
10:03.920 - 10:09.000:  What President Biden had to announce today was a number of measures to deal with the heat.
10:09.000 - 10:12.580:  In particular, better protection for workers, those working in sort of construction,
10:12.580 - 10:18.700:  farming to protect them and allow them not to have to work in those conditions.
10:18.780 - 10:23.560:  He announced a further $7 million to improve the nation's weather forecasting
10:23.660 - 10:28.920:  and about $150 million for better storage of water, particularly in those drought-affected
10:28.920 - 10:29.700:  western states.
10:29.700 - 10:34.000:  But I think the truth of the matter is that these are measures that deal with the symptoms
10:34.000 - 10:36.640:  of climate change, not the causes.
10:36.880 - 10:43.100:  When President Biden faced with a Congress that has sometimes been inclined to drag its
10:43.100 - 10:49.640:  feet on these matters, has been criticised by some for not acting quickly and effectively
10:49.640 - 10:49.980:  enough.
10:50.260 - 10:55.440:  And you have to remember, of course, that America is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse
10:55.440 - 10:58.020:  gases in the world, second only behind China.
10:58.940 - 10:59.520:  John Doniston.
11:00.260 - 11:05.420:  The UN says it suspended its humanitarian operations in Niger a day after soldiers announced
11:05.420 - 11:07.880:  the overthrow of the country's elected president.
11:08.420 - 11:12.760:  On Thursday, the UN Secretary-General demanded the release of Niger's president, Mohammad
11:12.760 - 11:18.360:  Bazoum, immediately and unconditionally, as military officers continue to hold him
11:18.380 - 11:18.840:  captive.
11:19.360 - 11:23.520:  He's been a key ally for western nations fighting Islamist militancy.
11:24.240 - 11:29.760:  There are now fears Niger could move closer to Russia and Wagner troops could replace
11:29.760 - 11:34.220:  French ones, as has happened in several other African countries.
11:34.940 - 11:41.400:  Erosani, a special adviser to President Bazoum, spoke to the BBC from Nanyami, the capital
11:41.400 - 11:41.940:  of Niger.
11:42.620 - 11:50.340:  This coup is really something that's pulling back our country and it's damaging our democracy,
11:50.500 - 11:55.140:  which is a democracy that everyone really appreciate.
11:55.920 - 12:01.920:  This coup is not for the interest of our country, it's not for the interest of our people.
12:02.420 - 12:10.400:  So this military, if they really love this country, should renounce to their coup and
12:11.160 - 12:17.180:  go back in their barracks and leave the democracy, go its way.
12:18.160 - 12:23.460:  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, has this assessment of why the coup matters to
12:23.460 - 12:24.540:  the rest of the world.
12:25.000 - 12:26.340:  And Niger matters for two reasons.
12:26.340 - 12:33.300:  One is it's got uranium ore, which is a hugely valuable natural resource, important to
12:33.300 - 12:36.800:  the French, but also of interest to the Wagner group.
12:37.260 - 12:41.840:  The other is that it has become the center of operations for the French, since they were
12:41.840 - 12:43.860:  in effect kicked out of Marley next door.
12:44.560 - 12:47.480:  The U.S. has got a hundred million dollar drone base there.
12:48.080 - 12:52.540:  The French have got over a thousand troops, Germany's got an outpost, Italy, Canada,
12:52.540 - 12:55.360:  train Nigerian special forces there.
12:56.160 - 13:00.220:  It was seen as a kind of island of stability in a very volatile region.
13:01.000 - 13:03.160:  And now Niger has had its own coup.
13:03.440 - 13:08.180:  It's still not clear how it's going to progress, and it's possible that the new leaders will
13:08.180 - 13:13.240:  say, well, the Western forces can stay on, but I think we should expect Wagner to want
13:13.240 - 13:13.960:  to make a move.
13:14.260 - 13:19.120:  They've been very successful in pushing out French and Western forces in three countries
13:19.120 - 13:23.840:  in the region, in Central African Republic, in Marley, and in Burkina Faso.
13:24.160 - 13:27.480:  They will almost certainly have their eyes on Niger as well.
13:27.920 - 13:32.680:  If that happens, then they've got a corridor linking all the way from Libya in the north,
13:33.200 - 13:34.420:  all the way down to Nigeria.
13:35.160 - 13:37.780:  And that would give the Kremlin an enormous reach in Africa.
13:38.540 - 13:39.220:  Thank God, now.
13:39.860 - 13:45.340:  Vladimir Putin has confirmed that there's been intensified fighting in Ukraine, especially
13:45.340 - 13:46.200:  in the South.
13:46.680 - 13:51.680:  He told Russian television that Ukrainian forces suffered heavy losses and had been pushed
13:51.840 - 13:52.120:  back.
13:52.520 - 13:53.340:  Grant their reports.
13:53.960 - 13:57.740:  President Putin does not often comment on the detail of fighting in Ukraine.
13:58.260 - 14:03.320:  His remarks on the sidelines of a summit with African leaders give way to increasing signs
14:03.320 - 14:07.420:  of a relatively big push by Ukrainian forces south of Zapparicia.
14:07.920 - 14:13.200:  The Russian president said combat activities had intensified significantly, but the enemy
14:13.200 - 14:14.620:  had achieved no success.
14:15.360 - 14:20.560:  According to the U.S. Institute for the Study of War, a significant mechanized counteroffensive
14:20.560 - 14:26.040:  by Ukraine appeared to have broken through some Russian defensive positions south of Orokiyv.
14:26.860 - 14:27.540:  Grant Ferret.
14:28.120 - 14:33.360:  Well, on the first day of that Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg, photos have been posted
14:33.360 - 14:38.940:  on social media, showing the head of the Vardno-Murstnery group Yevgeny Regojin.
14:39.380 - 14:43.380:  One of them shows him meeting an official from the Central African Republic.
14:44.000 - 14:45.840:  The images have caused surprise.
14:46.380 - 14:51.740:  Many people expected Mr. Pregorgin to be sidelined by President Putin after leading a failed
14:51.740 - 14:52.920:  mutiny last month.
14:53.520 - 14:58.540:  Vardno has troops in a number of African countries as we've been hearing, and I asked our Russia
14:58.540 - 15:02.480:  editor Steve Rosenberg about the Vardno-Chief's appearance in St. Petersburg.
15:03.020 - 15:05.820:  Yevgeny Pregorgin was not on the official list of participants.
15:06.380 - 15:11.160:  He was not sitting at the table today or at the plenary session as far as we could see,
15:11.680 - 15:16.520:  and then this incredible photograph pops up of a smiling Yevgeny Pregorgin shaking
15:16.520 - 15:22.760:  hands with an official from the Central African Republic, apparently in a St. Petersburg hotel.
15:23.660 - 15:27.020:  And it's incredible, really, when you think that just over a month ago, this is the man
15:27.020 - 15:33.940:  who basically organized a mutiny and sent his Vardno-fighters on the road marching on Moscow.
15:34.820 - 15:37.860:  And you know, several Russian soldiers were killed in that.
15:37.860 - 15:41.680:  It ended quite quickly, and yet here is Mr. Pregorgin a free man.
15:42.280 - 15:48.700:  In Russia, smiling in St. Petersburg, it may tell us that the Kremlin believes it needs
15:48.700 - 15:49.680:  Mr. Pregorgin.
15:49.680 - 15:54.280:  And it needs Vardno in certain parts of the world, especially Africa.
15:54.420 - 16:00.620:  Especially Africa, right, where Vardno paramilitaries have been very active, but it may also suggest
16:00.620 - 16:05.780:  that the Kremlin cannot move against Mr. Pregorgin, perhaps because he has very, very powerful
16:05.780 - 16:06.100:  friends.
16:06.440 - 16:11.040:  You would imagine this is uncomfortable for President Putin, and it comes as he's trying
16:11.040 - 16:16.760:  to shore up African support with promises of grain at a time when there are fewer African
16:16.760 - 16:19.380:  leaders than he would like attending this summit.
16:19.640 - 16:22.060:  Yeah, there are two ways of looking at this question of numbers, right?
16:22.060 - 16:26.540:  You could look at it and say, oh, goodness me, only 17 African heads of state.
16:27.100 - 16:32.260:  But the Kremlin has a kind of glass half full attitude to this question and says that it's
16:32.260 - 16:36.860:  a pretty good turnout, considering it's a difficult situation, geopolitical situation
16:36.980 - 16:37.660:  at the moment.
16:38.040 - 16:42.540:  In a sense, it doesn't really matter how many have come, because Vardno, Putin has got
16:42.540 - 16:43.360:  what he wanted, right?
16:43.360 - 16:49.660:  He's got this big international event, this big summit that he can use as a political
16:49.660 - 16:55.920:  stage to deliver various messages, message number one being, Russia is not as isolated
16:55.920 - 16:57.440:  as the West would have wanted.
16:58.000 - 17:03.100:  And he's also using it, I think, to try to change the whole narrative, to sort of distract
17:03.100 - 17:08.660:  from Russia's war in Ukraine and to portray his country as the caring, sharing Russia.
17:09.160 - 17:10.820:  That was Steve Rosenberg.
17:13.540 - 17:18.420:  Still to come, we hear how Prince Harry is set for a court showdown with the publisher
17:18.420 - 17:20.420:  of the Sun newspaper, In Britain.

18:26.120 - 18:27.760:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
18:28.360 - 18:32.960:  The European Central Bank has raised interest rates back to the record high last seen in
18:32.960 - 18:37.220:  2001, when it was trying to boost the value of the newly launched euro.
18:37.780 - 18:42.520:  The key rate was increased by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.75.
18:43.100 - 18:47.360:  It comes today after the US Federal Reserve raised rates by the same amount.
18:47.420 - 18:52.320:  The rise will push up the cost of borrowing from millions of households and businesses
18:52.840 - 18:54.460:  denting their ability to spend.
18:54.540 - 19:01.140:  The ECB President Christine Lagarde said the aim was to stop prices rising so rapidly.
19:02.100 - 19:08.580:  Inflation continues to decline, but is still expected to remain too high for too long.
19:09.660 - 19:16.140:  We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely
19:16.140 - 19:16.480:  manner.
19:17.640 - 19:23.460:  The governing council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates
19:24.060 - 19:25.560:  by 25 basis points.
19:27.060 - 19:33.460:  The rate increased today reflects our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying
19:33.460 - 19:37.100:  inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
19:37.900 - 19:42.140:  This latest rate hike wasn't unexpected and markets had priced it in.
19:42.700 - 19:47.180:  Some of them were exposed to Cornelia Mayer, an economist from Bern in Switzerland.
19:47.980 - 19:53.420:  I don't think it's a shock for businesses in Europe because as you said, it was expected.
19:53.980 - 20:02.920:  What is interesting is that Lagarde, Madame Lagarde and the ECB were not willing to give
20:02.920 - 20:06.780:  us guidance to what's happening, they're really watching inflation.
20:07.180 - 20:14.360:  Let's come down somewhat in the Eurozone to 5.5 percent in June from 6.1 percent, but
20:14.360 - 20:21.300:  the lead economy Germany, it's gone up from May to June to 6.4 percent from 6.1 percent.
20:21.340 - 20:26.000:  So when we talk about inflation, we are no way out of the doldrums.
20:26.160 - 20:30.200:  Miss Lagarde was also saying that consumer prices are still too high.
20:30.700 - 20:35.180:  Why are they still too high when we've had 12 months of rate hikes?
20:35.620 - 20:40.480:  Rate hikes are there to abate prices, but prices are also about supply chains.
20:41.020 - 20:42.500:  We have a war going on.
20:42.880 - 20:49.460:  If you look at what's happening in oil, oil has really risen, it's at the 3 months high.
20:50.000 - 20:56.620:  You look at agricultural prices, it's very high, core inflation is also quite high.
20:56.620 - 21:02.540:  That's when you strip out energy and you strip out food because we still have supply
21:02.540 - 21:03.600:  chain votes.
21:04.420 - 21:07.140:  So everything has become just a lot dearer.
21:07.200 - 21:12.200:  Is this the new normal, is this just what consumers have got to kind of get used to?
21:13.200 - 21:17.720:  Well I think it is something that consumers have got to got used to as long as we have
21:17.720 - 21:18.640:  it more in Europe.
21:19.080 - 21:25.720:  And especially now that the energy prices are going up again, we probably need to look
21:25.720 - 21:26.080:  at it.
21:26.340 - 21:35.780:  This is a major dislocation of supply chains, a rearranging of supply chains and those things
21:35.780 - 21:36.980:  do cost money.
21:38.020 - 21:40.300:  Cornelia Mayer, a Swiss economist.
21:41.240 - 21:46.240:  Mastercard has moved to block Americans from buying marijuana with their debit cards.
21:46.640 - 21:51.760:  While the drug is legal in many individual states, it's still illegal at a federal level,
21:51.760 - 21:55.860:  which means that most credit card providers cannot facilitate its purchase.
21:56.460 - 22:00.100:  So many cannabis retailers accept debit cards instead.
22:00.880 - 22:04.120:  Mastercard has said it must uphold federal law.
22:04.740 - 22:07.780:  Democrats in Congress have been trying to change those laws.
22:08.240 - 22:12.300:  Julian Marshall heard more from our business correspondent, Michelle Flurry, who's in New
22:12.360 - 22:12.640:  York.
22:13.020 - 22:17.500:  Mastercard has come out and it's essentially issued guidance to financial institutions
22:17.500 - 22:22.960:  but also to cannabis dispensaries that are allowed in certain states across America.
22:23.580 - 22:27.460:  But transactions are on its debit card and no longer allowed.
22:28.240 - 22:33.080:  And this is sort of a blow for an industry that really is already on the fringes of the
22:33.080 - 22:39.280:  financial system in the United States because marijuana remains illegal at the federal
22:39.280 - 22:45.020:  level, despite the fact that you have several individual states legalizing its medicinal
22:45.020 - 22:46.320:  and recreational use.
22:46.720 - 22:52.920:  That's created a sort of system whereby none of the major financial institutions, so
22:52.920 - 22:58.860:  no banks, will provide their services to these dispensaries that the industry, if you
22:58.860 - 23:00.800:  like, around cannabis that's growing up.
23:01.240 - 23:07.100:  And so many of them have to deal with cash in terms of payments instead of sort of
23:07.580 - 23:08.460:  cashless payments.
23:09.000 - 23:11.220:  And that is causing problems for them.
23:11.220 - 23:16.800:  Some had found a work around whereby debit cards and pins could be used as a form of payment,
23:16.800 - 23:19.760:  but Mastercard is essentially clamping down on that.
23:19.920 - 23:27.780:  I mean, are there any attempts at a federal level to legalize this, to make these transactions
23:27.860 - 23:28.320:  legal?
23:28.680 - 23:34.380:  Yes, so you've got the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his Republican counterpart
23:34.380 - 23:39.240:  John Corden who are trying to get a marijuana banking bill passed.
23:39.340 - 23:41.920:  It's called the Safe Banking Act.
23:42.360 - 23:46.340:  And the idea is that it would make it easier for the cannabis industry to access banking
23:46.340 - 23:46.980:  services.
23:47.100 - 23:52.360:  The problem is, at the moment, that just seems to be hitting road blocks within Congress.
23:53.040 - 23:58.600:  And with the Senate about to go on summer recess and no signs that it's about to be put
23:58.600 - 24:03.680:  to a vote before then, you're looking at least, you know, until the kind of the autumn
24:03.680 - 24:07.240:  before Congress turns its attention back to this and takes a vote.
24:07.640 - 24:12.760:  So there is no sign of change at the moment, but it is something that politicians recognize
24:13.180 - 24:13.780:  needs to change.
24:13.800 - 24:19.400:  That you can't have this sort of state level legalization of an industry and then keep
24:19.400 - 24:24.360:  it shut out of the banking system and essentially, in some ways, make it hard for them and also
24:24.360 - 24:27.260:  make some of these businesses more vulnerable to crime.
24:27.820 - 24:31.120:  Because if they're dealing with a lot of cash and people know that, that can make them
24:31.440 - 24:32.340:  target for thieves.
24:32.740 - 24:33.680:  It seems extraordinary, Michelle.
24:33.680 - 24:39.840:  There you use the phrase cannabis industry in the United States, one that is more or less
24:39.880 - 24:40.240:  legal.
24:40.620 - 24:47.120:  I mean, this has been, I think, if you look at polls of where Americans stand on sort
24:47.120 - 24:52.280:  of recreational use, attitudes have really changed over recent years.
24:52.960 - 24:54.440:  And that's being reflected.
24:54.440 - 24:59.140:  I think it's about more than 30 states at this stage, in which certainly medicinal, but
24:59.140 - 25:02.540:  also recreational use is now being legalized.
25:02.820 - 25:09.260:  And so there is this sort of situation then where the laws of the land at the federal level
25:09.260 - 25:12.180:  haven't kept pace with where people are at the state level.
25:12.520 - 25:16.960:  And so it's this kind of strange situation, which is leading companies like Mastercard to
25:16.960 - 25:19.500:  issue these sort of warnings.
25:20.440 - 25:21.780:  Michelle Flurry in New York.
25:22.500 - 25:27.060:  The high court in London has ruled that Prince Harry can sue the publisher of the Sun
25:27.060 - 25:32.620:  tabloid newspaper in Britain for allegedly using illegal methods to gather information
25:32.620 - 25:33.200:  on him.
25:33.800 - 25:38.620:  The Prince says he was targeted by journalists and private investigators working for the
25:38.620 - 25:40.960:  papers publisher News Group Newspapers.
25:41.480 - 25:42.840:  He's launched a claim for damages.
25:42.940 - 25:45.260:  The company denies the allegations.
25:45.780 - 25:49.220:  Our home affairs correspondent Tom Simons was at the high court.
25:49.840 - 25:54.640:  The Duke had six years to sue for breaches of his privacy, and these allegations go back
25:54.640 - 25:55.120:  decades.
25:55.180 - 25:59.040:  But he claimed he missed the deadline because he didn't know he had a case.
25:59.580 - 26:03.820:  He said lawyers at Buckingham Palace had decided not to take the publisher of the Sun to
26:03.820 - 26:08.520:  court under a secret agreement with the newspaper to settle cases at a later date
26:09.160 - 26:09.180:  date.
26:09.220 - 26:14.220:  The judge, Mr Justice Fancourt, ruled that the evidence to support this was vague and
26:14.220 - 26:14.660:  limited.
26:14.940 - 26:19.940:  He also said Prince Harry could have found out through exercising reasonable diligence
26:19.940 - 26:22.140:  that there was evidence of phone hacking.
26:22.700 - 26:27.000:  But the Duke has been given permission to go to trial on separate allegations that his
26:27.000 - 26:31.340:  private information was unlawfully obtained by investigators working for the newspaper.
26:32.140 - 26:37.580:  That may take place next year, with the actor Hugh Grant also taking legal action and
26:37.580 - 26:38.800:  more than a hundred others.
26:39.380 - 26:40.120:  Tom Simons.
26:40.640 - 26:45.740:  There's been a shock result at the Women's Football World Cup with Nigeria beating the
26:45.740 - 26:47.080:  co-hosts Australia.
26:47.620 - 26:52.380:  Some of the Nigerian players were in tears after their three-two victory in Brisbane.
26:53.060 - 26:56.660:  A win for Australia would have guaranteed their place in the next round.
26:57.140 - 26:58.500:  Mimi Fawaz was watching.
26:59.000 - 27:03.920:  Coming in our story game in the first half, we saw Niger strong and defensively very
27:03.920 - 27:04.580:  compact.
27:04.580 - 27:10.040:  But what they needed to do was to open play to press up front more, and that's exactly
27:10.040 - 27:15.880:  what we saw when a G-Baddy, of course, passed a go to Uche Nekanu, who then got that
27:15.880 - 27:16.700:  goal for Nigeria.
27:16.700 - 27:21.720:  And then asi Satoshwala coming in as a sub in the second half and getting the third
27:21.720 - 27:26.560:  goal for Nigeria, many Barcelona fans know her two times, of course, Champions League
27:26.560 - 27:31.780:  winner, five times African female footballer of the year, a super sub who got that winning
27:31.780 - 27:33.620:  goal for Nigeria in the match.
27:34.160 - 27:35.100:  Mimi Fawaz.
27:35.760 - 27:40.760:  Meanwhile, South Africa's DeZiri Ellis is one of 12 female coaches this year's Women's
27:40.760 - 27:41.540:  World Cup event.
27:41.880 - 27:45.700:  This is her second tournament in charge, and once she hopes will be better than the first
27:45.760 - 27:47.140:  time in 2019.
27:47.700 - 27:51.640:  When the South African squad, Banyana Banyana, failed to win a single match.
27:52.240 - 27:54.300:  Then Ellis thought that she'd be out of a job.
27:54.660 - 28:00.380:  Well, as South Africa faced Argentina on Friday, Celesteine Karoney reports on the coaches
28:00.700 - 28:02.940:  long career and South Africa's prospects.
28:05.740 - 28:10.740:  In July last year, the unmistakable South African chorus of Vuvuzela's reverberated
28:10.740 - 28:13.580:  through Prince Moolai Abdullah Stadium in Morocco.
28:14.220 - 28:18.980:  On the winner's podium with her team, Banyana Banyana dancing around her, coach DeZiri
28:18.980 - 28:24.100:  Ellis hoisted the Africa Women Cup of Nations trophy into the air as green, gold and purple
28:24.100 - 28:25.620:  confetti filled the sky.
28:26.040 - 28:30.340:  Women's football looked very different 30 years ago when Ellis, a former midfielder
28:30.340 - 28:33.320:  played for the same national team during a part-time.
28:33.440 - 28:39.400:  At times, when we traveled with provincial teams, they would allow us to go into a caravan
28:39.400 - 28:44.120:  park and when they saw the group of players coming in, they would all of a sudden change
28:44.120 - 28:46.320:  their minds and say, sorry, the place is full, etc.
28:46.860 - 28:48.040:  And all we wanted to do was play.
28:48.300 - 28:53.160:  After the Afghan victory, Ellis was awarded South Africa's highest honor, the order of
28:53.160 - 28:57.720:  Ikamanga by President Cyril Drauposa for her contribution to women's football.
28:58.080 - 29:02.940:  DeZiri's success with the team has been changing the perception of female coaches and
29:02.940 - 29:03.420:  players.
29:03.820 - 29:07.700:  What we do and what we've achieved, we've changed a lot of minds in 10 perceptions, there's
29:07.700 - 29:10.040:  a lot more goals wanting to play football now.
29:10.360 - 29:14.180:  I mean, these players, they can't walk in the street without having an auto-bred off-taken
29:14.180 - 29:17.920:  or having a, they felt agro-bred off-taken because of what they've achieved with Reffcon.
29:24.700 - 29:28.120:  During the afternoon Wellington New Zealand for this year's World Cup, team Banyana
29:28.120 - 29:33.460:  travelled to and from practice in white coach and blasted with images of players and on
29:33.460 - 29:36.240:  the back in a large letters, we leave them possible.
29:38.560 - 29:42.900:  With seven years of the job, Ellis is one of Africa's longest-saving coaches and has been
29:42.900 - 29:49.360:  crowned Cup coach of their year three times in a row in 2022, 2021 and 2020.
29:50.060 - 29:54.320:  Football commentator Gin Seninde tells us what makes Ellis a good coach.
29:54.840 - 30:00.100:  She has built a culture with her playing style, which is very direct and she doesn't change
30:00.100 - 30:01.860:  it whether they win or they lose.
30:02.340 - 30:07.480:  The team has a psychologist, the team also has someone who is helping the players with
30:07.480 - 30:12.420:  their men's tricycle because she knows when they are successful off the pitch and they
30:12.420 - 30:15.760:  are feeling good, they are going to give her the result that she needs on the pitch.
30:18.960 - 30:24.400:  Ellis led the team to their maiden World Cup participation in 2019, but the team didn't
30:24.400 - 30:25.620:  win a single match.
30:26.020 - 30:28.820:  Four years on, she feels that their odds have changed.
30:29.340 - 30:33.940:  A lot of the players have the experience, but also the experience of playing abroad, of
30:34.160 - 30:38.900:  training at the high level every day, of playing at the high level every week, so that
30:38.900 - 30:40.320:  brings a lot to the team.
30:40.600 - 30:44.560:  Getting positive results in the group and getting out of the group stage would be huge.
30:47.880 - 30:50.520:  That report was by Celestine Karoni.
30:51.520 - 30:58.320:  Archaeologists here in the UK say they've solved the mystery of who lies inside a 2,000
30:58.320 - 30:59.420:  year old grave.
31:00.460 - 31:06.480:  Analysis of the tooth enamel of the skeleton has shed new light on the role of women in
31:06.520 - 31:09.500:  prehistoric Britain as Stephanie Prentice reports.
31:10.180 - 31:15.680:  The grave found on an island off the south of England was as confusing as it was intriguing.
31:16.220 - 31:21.040:  It's seen that the stone line chamber had been made for someone of high status, but scientists
31:21.040 - 31:24.260:  couldn't tell if a man or a woman had been buried inside.
31:24.900 - 31:29.400:  Items found within the chamber, along sword and what seemed to be a mirror, should have
31:29.400 - 31:31.940:  been clues, but actually caused more confusion.
31:32.440 - 31:37.100:  The sword was more commonly associated with eye-n-age males and the mirror with females.
31:37.960 - 31:43.400:  Two attempts at analysing bones found inside failed and the mystery was left unsolved.
31:43.920 - 31:46.960:  But now new techniques have helped the puzzle come together.
31:47.620 - 31:53.240:  Sarah Stark is a human skeletal biologist at UK Heritage Organization, Historic England.
31:53.300 - 31:58.660:  Unfortunately, the DNA just hadn't survived because of this harsh soil environment.
31:59.040 - 32:02.460:  So luckily for us, though, we have this emerging technique.
32:03.260 - 32:08.380:  And rather than looking at the DNA, we're actually able to look at proteins that are found
32:08.380 - 32:09.220:  in our teeth.
32:09.660 - 32:15.060:  It's a really similar idea to DNA where the proteins can be linked to xy chromosomes.
32:15.980 - 32:20.280:  So this is how we were able to not only get a result, but get a really strong result
32:20.340 - 32:21.960:  that this was indeed a female.
32:22.520 - 32:27.440:  The grave and the items inside belonging to a female have made researchers reimagine
32:27.440 - 32:32.380:  the role of women during the eye-n-age and say some of them had a leading role in warfare
32:32.380 - 32:37.120:  at the time and probably used mirrors to signal during raids on other communities.
32:37.940 - 32:42.480:  The next step for the team is to use the new technology to review other eye-n-age burial
32:42.480 - 32:47.700:  sites all around the world and try to learn more about what they call hidden female warriors.
32:48.520 - 32:49.520:  Stephanie Prentice
32:52.020 - 32:56.140:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the Global News Podcast
32:56.140 - 32:56.620:  later.
