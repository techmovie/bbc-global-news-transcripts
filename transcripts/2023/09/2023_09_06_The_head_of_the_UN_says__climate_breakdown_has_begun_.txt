01:11.720 - 01:17.980:  this podcast. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:18.680 - 01:26.420:  I'm Valerie Sanderson and it 49 is GMT on Wednesday the 6th of September. These are our main stories.
01:27.000 - 01:31.520:  A catastrophic warning about the future of the planet is issued by the head of the UN.
01:31.580 - 01:36.640:  The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, is in Ukraine four months after the start of
01:36.640 - 01:42.360:  Kiev's counteroffensive against Russian forces. Our security correspondent has been looking into
01:42.360 - 01:47.120:  Ukraine's use of drones and artificial intelligence in its war with Russia.
01:49.900 - 01:55.960:  Also in this podcast, Brazil federal help is promised after 21 people die in bad weather,
01:56.340 - 01:58.560:  prompting a huge search and rescue effort.
02:02.360 - 02:05.420:  Hundreds of people were saved, hundreds of people were rescued.
02:09.140 - 02:14.700:  We begin with this warning. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says climate breakdown
02:14.700 - 02:20.660:  has begun. It comes as two studies show this year is likely to be the hottest in human history.
02:21.240 - 02:26.320:  Clarenalysis from the World Meteorological Organization, which is warning that climate and air
02:26.320 - 02:32.260:  quality are intrinsically linked. Earth just had its hottest three-month period on record
02:33.120 - 02:39.100:  with unprecedented sea surface temperatures and much extreme weather. Global sea surface temperatures
02:39.440 - 02:45.320:  are unprecedented. Antarctic sea ice is unprecedentedly low for this time of year
02:46.060 - 02:52.420:  and it was the hottest August on record by a big margin. This record-breaking summer
02:52.720 - 02:58.860:  sets the scene for the fact that we are seeing more extreme heat. We are seeing more heat waves.
02:58.860 - 03:03.520:  This does have an impact on human health and on air quality.
03:04.360 - 03:08.080:  Our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhard, has been looking at the details.
03:08.740 - 03:14.080:  The findings of this scientific study is that the last three months of the average has been
03:14.120 - 03:21.520:  16.77 degrees Celsius, which is higher for that period by some considerable margin,
03:21.520 - 03:28.920:  0.29 degrees Celsius, which in climate terms is huge and the deputy director of the Copernica
03:28.920 - 03:33.920:  Service, Samantha Burgess says that basically these last three months have been the highest
03:34.240 - 03:40.680:  period, which she believes, in 120,000 years, which is broadly speaking much of the time that
03:40.680 - 03:47.760:  modern humans have been on this earth. It's not just this year. The warmest nine periods for
03:48.020 - 03:52.860:  June, July and August have been in the last nine years, so there's a consistent pattern here.
03:53.280 - 03:57.540:  The size is absolutely overwhelming. It relies on billions of measurements from
03:57.540 - 04:03.440:  satellite ships, aircraft, weather stations, and you're seeing it not just overland, but also
04:04.080 - 04:09.060:  on the sea. It also highlights that August has had the highest global average sea surface temperatures
04:09.620 - 04:16.140:  ever, and you're seeing the lowest amount of Antarctic sea ice, 12% down on what it normally is.
04:16.280 - 04:19.320:  So we're talking about the changes in the weather. What does it mean for people?
04:20.300 - 04:24.960:  Yeah, basically, as the scientists have been warning for a long time, that the
04:25.400 - 04:30.920:  more the climate warms, the more you'll get intense weather events, droughts, heat waves,
04:30.920 - 04:36.940:  flooding, that sort of thing. So what you've seen is, for example, the massive wildfires we've
04:36.940 - 04:42.640:  had in Canada, where it's the worst wildfire season on record, an area bigger than
04:42.640 - 04:50.500:  Tunisia has burned in Canada this year, 16.5 million hectares. That's about 165,000 square kilometers.
04:51.160 - 04:55.620:  It also fires in Algeria, for example, in North Africa. Recently, we've seen
04:55.940 - 05:01.620:  ones in Greece. We saw the fire hurricane that hit Maui in Hawaii. We've also seen flooding,
05:01.620 - 05:07.780:  so you've had China hit by three typhoons in July. We've had mudslides set off into Jikistan
05:07.780 - 05:12.780:  due to heavy rainfall, and also, of course, droughts. So huge impact, not just on people
05:12.780 - 05:17.820:  and property, but also agriculture. Any hint of optimism. Very little, although
05:17.820 - 05:22.700:  good tarish, he has been ringing the alarm bells now for a number of years, and he said,
05:23.320 - 05:28.240:  basically, you know, that people need to wake up. They need to be immediate and dramatic action
05:28.240 - 05:35.280:  on cutting greenhouse gases. The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has made a surprise visit
05:35.280 - 05:40.700:  to Ukraine to meet President Zelensky and senior officials there. Speaking at a joint news conference
05:40.700 - 05:45.540:  with Ukraine's Foreign Minister, he said his visit, four months into Ukraine's counteroffensive
05:45.540 - 05:52.800:  against Russian forces, is to show America's ongoing support. We've seen good progress in the counteroffensive
05:52.920 - 05:59.180:  and it's very hard. We want to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs not only to succeed in
05:59.180 - 06:04.140:  the counteroffensive, but has what it needs for the long term to make sure that it has a strong
06:04.140 - 06:09.560:  deterrent, a strong defense capacity, so that in the future, aggressions like this don't happen
06:09.560 - 06:15.300:  again. And we're also determined to continue to work with our partners as they build and rebuild
06:16.100 - 06:21.060:  a strong economy, a strong democracy, all of which is necessary to ensure that
06:21.360 - 06:24.800:  Ukraine not only survives, but it thrives in the future.
06:25.500 - 06:30.720:  So what kind of assistance will the US give Ukraine? Our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams,
06:30.720 - 06:38.660:  is in key. If you bear in mind that the US has already committed around $43 billion to Ukraine
06:38.660 - 06:44.080:  just in security assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last year,
06:44.700 - 06:50.240:  what we're going to hear today, we understand, is another billion in a mixture of security and
06:50.240 - 06:56.700:  other assistance. We haven't been told the details, the mix yet, but it is yet another
06:57.360 - 07:04.760:  pledged by the Americans in what has become, you know, a very, very constant stream of pledges
07:05.120 - 07:12.520:  of all sorts of assistance to keep Ukraine afloat and fighting as this war goes on.
07:13.180 - 07:16.940:  I think what's interesting about this visit is it, and which is the sixth visit by
07:17.420 - 07:23.280:  the Secretary of State since the war, full-scale invasion happened, is that it comes,
07:23.340 - 07:29.140:  it's his first trip since Ukraine launched its counteroffensive in the South back in June.
07:29.140 - 07:35.640:  So I think it's an opportunity for him to hear, excuse me, to hear directly from the Ukrainians
07:35.640 - 07:40.280:  about how that offensive is going. You're bear in mind that in recent weeks we've heard quite a
07:40.280 - 07:46.740:  bit of criticism from unnamed American officials about the way the counteroffensive
07:46.740 - 07:51.140:  was being managed and how slowly it was going. Well, in the last week or so we've been hearing
07:51.140 - 07:55.700:  signs of progress, and so that's definitely an opportunity for the Ukrainians to tell you
07:56.000 - 07:58.660:  the Americans exactly what's going on down in the South.
08:00.000 - 08:05.060:  Paul Adams in Ukraine. And staying in the country after a year and a half of conflict,
08:05.060 - 08:09.940:  it's increasingly clear that technology is playing a central role on the battlefield.
08:09.980 - 08:15.420:  Now, speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian Security Service has revealed how it uses artificial
08:15.500 - 08:20.980:  intelligence and drones in a daily high-tech battle with the Russian military while also fighting
08:20.980 - 08:25.980:  off cyber attacks. Our security correspondent Gordon Carrera reports from Ukraine.
08:29.220 - 08:34.180:  In a location we've been asked not to disclose, Anton is training operators how to use drones.
08:36.220 - 08:42.460:  The trick is not learning how to fly the drones, but how to stay alive since the operators are
08:42.460 - 08:47.680:  having to move closer and closer to the front line. Right now, the distance is getting shorter
08:47.680 - 08:55.140:  and shorter, because of enemies jamming systems. Even though the battlefield of Ukraine can sometimes
08:55.140 - 09:01.100:  resemble something out of World War I with artillery pounding trenches, the high-tech battlefield
09:01.100 - 09:07.040:  of drones and cyberspaces vital. We have a number of responsibilities like field officers,
09:07.600 - 09:13.040:  technical specialists, people who are directly involved in combat on the front lines.
09:13.040 - 09:18.220:  Inside the heavily guarded headquarters of the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU,
09:18.540 - 09:24.160:  I sat down with Ilya Vityuk, the head of its cyber department. Undercover teams will manually
09:24.160 - 09:29.660:  guide a kamikaze drone onto surveillance cameras being used by Russia to watch Ukrainian
09:29.660 - 09:35.420:  troop movements. Using artificial intelligence, we penetrate their surveillance cameras,
09:36.080 - 09:41.980:  and we understand the movement of the troops, and we understand which type of weapons they are
09:41.980 - 09:46.660:  about to use on what direction, and that also goes to military, and they decide how to act.
09:46.840 - 09:52.260:  And there are some other things, but I cannot reveal it, because otherwise we don't want our enemy to know.
09:52.260 - 09:54.580:  Are you using artificial intelligence, in some cases, to analyze?
09:54.680 - 10:00.420:  Absolutely. We use artificial intelligence as well, facial recognition, and then we understand
10:00.420 - 10:07.440:  who was exactly guilty in different war crimes conducted by Russian troops.
10:11.200 - 10:16.740:  Viktor Zora is the man in charge of cyber defense for Ukraine. In his incident response center
10:16.740 - 10:21.820:  where his young staff work, he shows me the scale of Russian cyber attacks. These are often
10:21.820 - 10:27.360:  combined with missile strikes and military operations, for instance on Ukraine's energy grid.
10:27.660 - 10:32.220:  One of major cyber attacks we prevented happened on April 8th, in the beginning of war,
10:32.700 - 10:40.600:  but later on in autumn the aggressors continue to attack our energy objects both conventional way
10:40.600 - 10:44.480:  and in cyberspace. Back at the security service, the SBU,
10:44.780 - 10:48.640:  Ilya Vitchuk's teams are trying to take the fight to Russia's spy service hackers,
10:49.220 - 10:55.080:  hacking into their systems. And in doing this, he argues Ukraine is absorbing attacks that would
10:55.080 - 11:02.520:  otherwise head towards its allies. Most of aggressive cyber potential of Russia, it goes here
11:02.740 - 11:10.960:  to Ukraine. So if Ukraine and cyber defense would fall, this whole cyber potential, they would use
11:10.960 - 11:17.060:  it somewhere else, whether in European countries and states, grid, Britain, or whatever. Ukraine may
11:17.060 - 11:22.860:  be absorbing Russian attacks for its allies, but it's also teaching them how to fight a new
11:22.860 - 11:29.660:  high-tech war of the future. Gordon Carrera in Ukraine. The murder of a 10-year-old girl who was
11:29.660 - 11:34.820:  found dead at her home in England last month has provoked investigations by police forces here in
11:34.820 - 11:40.920:  the UK and in Pakistan. A post-mortem revealed that Sari Sharif had suffered multiple and extensive
11:40.920 - 11:46.120:  injuries. Her father and stepmother flew to Pakistan with other members of the family the day
11:46.120 - 11:51.240:  before her body was found, and there's been a search for them ever since. They're still on the run,
11:51.240 - 11:56.600:  but they've now released a video statement the first time we've heard from them since Sari's death.
11:57.160 - 12:01.740:  Here's the stepmother Benash Batul. There are a couple of things I would like to address.
12:02.420 - 12:08.880:  Firstly, I would like to talk about Sari. Sari's death was a incident. Our family in Pakistan are
12:08.880 - 12:14.340:  severely affected by all that is going on. They are harassing my extended family. They have also
12:14.340 - 12:19.860:  illegally raided many more of my family members' homes. We have already approached our lawyer,
12:19.860 - 12:25.840:  and our lawyer is representing us in Royal Bindi High Court. The next court hearing is on 19th September
12:25.840 - 12:32.200:  2023. My main concern is that the Pakistani police were torture-okay loss. That is why we have
12:32.200 - 12:38.500:  gone into hiding. Lastly, we are willing to cooperate with the UK authorities and fight our case
12:38.500 - 12:44.560:  in court. Our Pakistan correspondent, Caroline Davis, Tomi Moore. In this video, you have
12:44.560 - 12:50.600:  Urfan Sharif Sari's father sitting next to Benash Batul, her stepmother. Throughout the course of the
12:50.600 - 12:56.360:  video, in its two minutes, 36 long, we don't hear from Urfan Sharif. We only hear from Benash Batul,
12:56.700 - 13:01.700:  who is reading from a notebook that is in her lap full of what has been written notes.
13:01.700 - 13:08.920:  Now, during the course of this video, she mentions Sari once. She refers to Sari's death as an
13:08.920 - 13:16.600:  incident. The majority of the video is Benash Batul alleging various harassment cases against the
13:16.600 - 13:22.180:  Pakistan police. The Pakistan police have been harassing her family and Urfan Sharif's extended
13:22.180 - 13:26.820:  family in the process of trying to find them. She alleges that they have been illegally detaining
13:26.820 - 13:31.140:  her family members that they have been raiding people's homes. She alleges that they have taken
13:31.140 - 13:36.820:  jewelry and mobile phones from members of their family. We have spoken of course to the Pakistan
13:37.180 - 13:41.920:  police and they have said that these are all baseless allegations that this is not true.
13:42.500 - 13:47.940:  During the course of this video, near the end, Benash Batul also says that the reason they are not
13:47.940 - 13:53.440:  currently handing themselves into the Pakistan authorities is because they are scared in her words
13:53.440 - 13:58.580:  that they might be tortured and killed. Now, again, the Pakistan police have said that this is
13:58.840 - 14:04.480:  baseless and that they have said that if the family have any concerns, they should just speak to
14:04.480 - 14:10.180:  the courts to provide forms of protection. I think what's also quite crucial is the timing
14:10.180 - 14:16.940:  of this video. During the course of the recording, Benash Batul mentions a court decision that was
14:16.940 - 14:21.940:  made yesterday morning. So, we believe that this video has been made in the course of the last
14:22.000 - 14:28.940:  day. I think crucially important as well is that we are not able to verify the conditions
14:29.580 - 14:37.020:  under which this video was filmed and we are not able to identify the location of where this video
14:37.380 - 14:41.700:  was filmed. Crucially important of course because the family have been in hiding since the left
14:41.700 - 14:47.440:  UK on the 9th of August and the police here in Pakistan have been searching for them.
14:47.600 - 14:53.400:  But what is the major development of course from this video is that during the course of the video,
14:53.400 - 15:01.080:  Benash Batul says that her and family are willing to work with UK authorities in her words
15:01.080 - 15:09.800:  to so they can fight their case. So, do we know what happens next? No, ultimately we don't know
15:09.840 - 15:16.700:  what the next stage is. We are in touch with both the UK authorities and with the Pakistan
15:16.700 - 15:23.860:  authorities and we are waiting to hear what happens next. But after nearly a month and in fact
15:23.860 - 15:30.500:  it is four weeks today since a financial refeonage Batul and Faisal Malik left the UK to come to
15:30.500 - 15:37.180:  Pakistan. At the moment their location is still unknown. The police have not said that they know
15:37.180 - 15:42.100:  where they are. They are still in hiding and so it is fairly interesting that we now have this
15:42.100 - 15:49.400:  first piece of publicly speaking about this situation. Caroline Davis. Now this next story is
15:49.400 - 15:55.260:  making my skin crawl just thinking about it. A cinema chain in France is apologise to customers
15:55.260 - 16:00.380:  who have emerged from seeing a movie with blotchy red skin and bites after falling victim to an
16:00.380 - 16:06.200:  invasion of bed bugs. The UGC chain has admitted the bugs are present in some of its cinemas but
16:06.200 - 16:10.820:  insists there are no grounds for compensating victims because the insects are currently
16:10.820 - 16:17.440:  rife in France. So how widespread is the problem? Well our correspondent in Paris is
16:17.440 - 16:21.820:  used for food. Well it is not just in cinemas it is not just in France. I mean this is a
16:22.340 - 16:26.380:  problem across the developed world. There has been a resurgence in bed bugs,
16:26.380 - 16:31.700:  symexlectularius across developed countries in the last 20 years to the point where it is becoming
16:31.700 - 16:37.920:  you know recognised and very worrying phenomenon in Paris. A regularly told about the risks of our
16:37.920 - 16:44.360:  homes being infested by bed bugs. My sons flat was infested by bed bugs and it is a very serious
16:44.360 - 16:50.080:  problem. It is no surprise that cinemas have fallen victim to because bed bugs like the dark.
16:50.080 - 16:55.800:  They like places where people sit down to running warmth or lie down and that is why you know
16:55.800 - 17:01.700:  lovely plush cinema seats are a perfect place for them. Why they are spreading so much recently
17:01.700 - 17:08.080:  is probably to do with wider international travel. It is also to do probably with the
17:08.080 - 17:14.260:  banning of DVTs and other insecticides for health reasons for humans which has meant that
17:14.540 - 17:20.580:  they are less prone to being eradicated by insecticides. Yes because they weren't nearly eliminated
17:20.580 - 17:26.840:  weren't they back in the 1950s. As I understand it that is the case and I mean if you read the literature
17:26.840 - 17:31.960:  you will see you know that this is a phenomenon right across America, Britain, Australia,
17:31.960 - 17:37.640:  Europe, oddly one of the things that they think may have been useful in keeping their numbers down
17:37.640 - 17:42.880:  in the past was cockroaches but then cockroaches have been more as eliminated in cities like New
17:42.880 - 17:47.620:  York or here and they are much less common and that may be why bed bugs have appeared so once
17:47.620 - 17:53.520:  they should be able to reduce cockroaches. I am sure hotels are going to do that not. What are
17:53.520 - 17:58.040:  they going to do though because obviously this is going to have a presumably an impact on for
17:58.040 - 18:03.580:  example tourism. Well it is very very worrying and it is a sort of unreported scare really.
18:04.440 - 18:09.360:  Hotels I think quietly are very worried about it. It is very very easy to pick them up, pick up an
18:09.360 - 18:12.560:  infestation. I have certainly been in the hotel where I have had an infestation in Brussels a few
18:12.560 - 18:17.220:  years ago and it is not pleasant. The hotels are very very mindful of this. Homeowners are very
18:17.220 - 18:20.900:  that mindfulness. Cinema owners are very mindful of this. There are ways they are eradicating them
18:20.900 - 18:24.500:  but it is very difficult to do it and you have got to get in there early. Basically you have got
18:24.500 - 18:31.240:  to treat your fabrics and your home or your cinema with a heat treatment that they have
18:31.240 - 18:35.760:  full victims of either very cold or very hot temperatures but you basically need specialist
18:35.760 - 18:40.740:  to do it. Bringing out insecticides merely chases them into a neighbouring apartment.
18:41.240 - 18:45.260:  The trouble is you know ordinary people will not have the equipment needed to eradicate them.
18:45.880 - 18:47.820:  He's gofield on bed bugs.
18:50.740 - 18:56.960:  Still to come we're in Bangladesh. Everything, every product price hype. Salt, oil,
18:56.960 - 19:03.460:  vegetable, rice, fish, chicken, everything. Just almost double.
19:04.100 - 19:07.420:  Where the cost of living crisis is affecting the most vulnerable.
19:13.240 - 19:17.620:  Unexpected elements is the podcast that sifts through the week's news to unearth
19:17.660 - 19:22.440:  surprising nuggets of science. I really wanted to look at an animal that as far as we could tell
19:22.440 - 19:27.940:  at least doesn't seem to age. Okay you have my attention tell me more and uncover the unexpected
19:27.940 - 19:31.840:  connections between them. I think now it's a good time to talk about worms.
19:31.840 - 19:37.600:  Really worms? Absolutely. Unexpected elements from the BBC World Service.
19:37.600 - 19:41.400:  Amazing stuff. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
19:45.620 - 19:49.580:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
19:49.720 - 19:55.520:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
19:55.520 - 19:59.960:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
20:00.060 - 20:04.880:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad gal as she claims or what Jeff Bezos
20:04.880 - 20:09.200:  really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars.
20:09.200 - 20:13.080:  Listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me Simon Jack. And me Zingsing.
20:13.120 - 20:15.260:  Available now wherever you get your podcasts.
20:19.880 - 20:25.120:  Welcome back. One of the European Union's highest courts has dismissed a claim for
20:25.120 - 20:31.060:  damages against the block's border agency Frontex by a family of Syrian asylum seekers who were
20:31.060 - 20:36.040:  deported from Greece. Their lawyers are considering an appeal. Bethany Bell has more details.
20:36.520 - 20:42.460:  The Syrian family which included four small children arrived in Greece in October 2016.
20:42.460 - 20:47.660:  But 11 days later they were put on a plane to Turkey by Frontex and the Greek authorities
20:48.440 - 20:53.840:  without having been able to apply for asylum. Their lawyers argued that Frontex was accountable.
20:53.840 - 21:00.400:  But the court dismissed that. It said Frontex's task was only to provide technical and operational
21:00.520 - 21:06.920:  support to EU member states. It said EU member states alone were competent to assess return
21:06.920 - 21:14.460:  decisions and examine applications for international protection. Bethany Bell. A powerful cyclone has
21:14.460 - 21:20.040:  killed more than 20 people in southern Brazil. Videos show families on the rooftops of their houses
21:20.040 - 21:26.540:  pleading for help as rivers overflow their banks. The governor of Rio Grande de Sul, Eduardo Letti
21:26.540 - 21:35.600:  described it as the state's worst ever weather disaster. Hundreds of people were saved, hundreds of
21:35.600 - 21:41.160:  people were rescued. But unfortunately I've now received information that 15 bodies have been
21:41.160 - 21:48.320:  located in the town of Mussoon. This causes us immense pain. It raises the number of dead to 21,
21:49.080 - 21:53.880:  already making it the highest death toll in a weather event in the state of Rio Grande de Sul.
21:54.560 - 21:59.500:  It's winter in Brazil but that part of the world is experiencing warmer temperatures with
21:59.500 - 22:05.820:  unprecedented levels of rainfall this year. So why is this happening? Professor Francisco Aquino
22:05.820 - 22:13.560:  is a climatologist in Porto Alegre in southern Brazil. In this year we know like everywhere in the
22:13.560 - 22:20.440:  world we have much more higher temperatures for our winter and the atlantki oceans is the
22:20.440 - 22:28.880:  temperatures much above of the normal. So it's increased the cyclogenesis. During the last two decades
22:28.880 - 22:35.600:  we are exploring in our laboratory the number and the intensity of the extra-tropical cyclones
22:35.600 - 22:44.280:  in the area around the southeast of South America. We didn't observe an increase of the number
22:44.280 - 22:51.040:  of cyclones but we clear observe and increase in the intensity of the cyclones.
22:51.180 - 22:58.780:  It's been described called the worst cyclone disaster in Brazil's history. Looking now ahead
22:58.780 - 23:04.920:  is there anything that people in the region in the world can actually do to prevent or make sure
23:04.920 - 23:11.620:  that they have the tools necessary to withstand such kind of events and disasters?
23:12.200 - 23:18.880:  Yes we can say that around the whole solar atmosphere in the same latitudes we observe the same
23:18.880 - 23:26.260:  pattern of events, extra-tropical cyclones or meteorological events. Unfortunately we talk about
23:26.260 - 23:35.560:  21-22 deaths in our region in the last three days and by lucky we can say the local
23:35.560 - 23:42.960:  government and the municipalities are working together since the beginning of the first alerts.
23:43.740 - 23:53.380:  So I suspect we can mitigate much more with we keep improving the meteorological alerts
23:53.900 - 24:01.400:  and try to explain the whole society in our region. On our days and the next decades this kind of
24:01.400 - 24:07.480:  weather we will start really much more common and more in things. Professor Francisco Aquino speaking
24:07.480 - 24:13.960:  there to the BBC's Victoria Abonjunda. In Bangladesh thousands of people have taken to the streets
24:13.960 - 24:19.080:  in recent months demanding the government do more to tackle rising food and fuel prices.
24:19.180 - 24:24.160:  The government has blamed high inflation on the war in Ukraine. Rajini Vajanathan reports
24:24.160 - 24:30.320:  from Bangladesh in the last of our series on the global cost of living crisis and its effect on
24:30.320 - 24:37.500:  youngsters. We've given more than seven hours from the capital Ducca and we've come to the village
24:37.500 - 24:44.740:  of Acha Gandhi which is in Jammalport district. You can see jackfruit growing very verdant fields where
24:44.740 - 24:52.540:  rice is harvested. This is one of the country's poorest areas and we've come here because we've
24:52.540 - 25:00.080:  been told that one in three children here is malnourished. Almost 90 percent people are dependent on
25:00.080 - 25:06.220:  the agriculture. Murshid Ali an NGO worker is taking me around. This is poor, different areas.
25:06.220 - 25:11.840:  There is no option to get any type of profession so they have no option without agriculture.
25:11.920 - 25:17.160:  So that means that when the cost of living crisis, growth, prices up, things like fuel and
25:17.160 - 25:24.440:  fertilizer, it really hit an area like this. If you talk with any people, they just say about
25:25.360 - 25:35.760:  everything, every product, price height, salt, oil, vegetable, rice, fish, chicken, everything,
25:35.760 - 25:41.440:  just almost double. Last year as global oil cost rose due to the war in
25:41.440 - 25:48.360:  Ukraine, the government in Bangladesh hiked fuel prices by 50 percent overnight. It was another
25:48.360 - 25:54.460:  blow for this area after the impact of COVID and devastating floods which decimated crops.
25:55.340 - 26:01.300:  We're just heading to meet a family who say that this cost of living crisis has meant that
26:01.300 - 26:09.320:  they're really struggling to feed their young children. Rizophon's cradling her tiny baby is
26:09.420 - 26:15.900:  who won't stop crying. The 15-month-old is severely underweight. Her ribs are protruding.
26:20.120 - 26:26.740:  I am hungry. My children cry because they are hungry. We can't eat meat or fish anymore.
26:26.740 - 26:33.420:  Even fresh vegetables are so costly. What can we do? And with prices rising, she's worried.
26:33.420 - 26:38.460:  She may have to start begging. The family gets some rice rations from the government,
26:38.460 - 26:45.340:  but it's not enough. From the villages to the big cities, the cost of living crisis is
26:45.340 - 26:51.000:  hitting hard. Nearly a third of low-income families are unable to afford nutritious food.
26:51.720 - 26:57.380:  A growing economy which has faltered, Bangladesh was forced to get help from the IMF this year,
26:57.380 - 27:04.540:  as its foreign currency reserves dwindled. We're in the capital Ducca and we're on the way to one
27:04.540 - 27:14.300:  of the top children's hospitals in the country. We come to see a healthy eating workshop here.
27:15.120 - 27:19.700:  Sitting cross-legged in one of the wards are around half a dozen mothers holding their babies,
27:19.700 - 27:27.160:  who have all been treated for malnourishment. At the front, a nurse holds up a potato,
27:27.180 - 27:32.700:  telling them it's a vegetable they should try to include in meals. But the price of a potato
27:33.380 - 27:40.160:  is now up by 75 percent on last year. Basics which were affordable are now considered luxuries.
27:42.280 - 27:47.980:  Rajini Vajanathan. It's been described as one of the greatest mysteries in rock and roll history.
27:47.980 - 27:54.960:  Paul McCartney's lost-based guitar. He bought it in Hamburg back in 1961, but it disappeared
27:54.960 - 27:59.940:  eight years later. A global search was launched on Saturday and already the team has received
27:59.940 - 28:05.820:  hundreds of potential leads. It was a Hoffner-based expert that's the type of guitar Paul lost
28:05.820 - 28:11.900:  is leading the search. We've had a lot of messages, I suppose, about 600 have come in over the
28:12.040 - 28:18.780:  last two or three days and some of them are very interesting for us. There's always been
28:18.780 - 28:25.900:  some rumors we've had in the past, a little bit of information here and there. One or two of the
28:25.900 - 28:32.080:  messages actually have started to confirm what we thought may have happened in the past. That's
28:32.080 - 28:39.560:  really useful to us. As I say, we've had one or two theories and ideas put to us. It potentially
28:39.560 - 28:47.260:  disappeared from the Beatles headquarters in London. Somebody stole it. It may have disappeared
28:47.260 - 28:52.780:  slightly after that. We're not sure. It's stolen while it was on the road or something like that.
28:53.360 - 28:59.360:  We really have to piece stuff together carefully now before we jump to conclusions, I suppose.
29:00.140 - 29:05.960:  Nick Was. And finally, a man has been arrested in the US after he was caught trying to cross
29:05.960 - 29:11.960:  the Atlantic in a vessel resembling a human-powered hamster wheel. Court papers filed in Florida
29:11.960 - 29:17.660:  detail a three days stand-off last month between the Intrepid Voyager and the US Coast Guard.
29:18.220 - 29:22.640:  Benedict Kehoe digs up the story. The US Coast Guard was patrolling about
29:22.640 - 29:28.620:  a hundred kilometres off the Georgia Coast last month, when 44-year-old Razor Ballucci was spotted
29:28.620 - 29:34.840:  in a bizarre giant metal drum, being kept afloat with inflatable red boys on each end,
29:35.280 - 29:40.300:  and paddles that he was operating inside. When intercepted, he said he was running in his
29:40.300 - 29:46.100:  hamster wheel all the way to London. Resisting attempts to thwart his mission, he threatened to
29:46.100 - 29:51.600:  kill himself with a 12-inch knife and falsely claimed to have a bomb on board his contraption.
29:52.300 - 29:58.680:  A three-day stand-off at sea ensued. Officials determined his craft was manifestly unsafe
29:58.680 - 30:04.360:  and his now facing federal charges. The Iranian-born former athlete has attempted
30:04.360 - 30:10.680:  three other extreme voyages in homemade self-propelled vessels, all-offended in failure.
30:10.700 - 30:16.740:  The most spectacular fail was two years ago, when he tried a journey from Florida to New York,
30:16.740 - 30:22.340:  but washed ashore after just 40 kilometres. His reportage has said it's all part of efforts
30:22.340 - 30:27.140:  to raise money for charitable causes, insisting he'll never give up on his dreams.
30:28.060 - 30:29.020:  Buridet Kiho
30:31.380 - 30:34.820:  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
