*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:15.940* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.840- 00:24.760* :  I'm Robyn Brandt and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 26th of September, these are our main stories.
*00:24.760- 00:28.660* :  Thousands are fleeing their homes in the Gourner-Karabakh, prompting concern
*00:28.660- 00:34.500* :  from the USAID chief who described the situation there as harrowing. The Saudi delegation is
*00:34.500- 00:40.120* :  paying a rare visit to Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank, as Riyadh continues normalisation
*00:40.120- 00:45.640* :  talks with Israel, and Thailand sentences an anti-monarchy campaigner to four years in jail.
*00:48.760- 00:53.820* :  Also in this podcast, new figures suggest the sea ice around Antarctica has shrunk,
*00:54.440- 00:57.300* :  and we're with Ukraine soldiers ahead of a second winter of fighting.
*00:57.740- 01:03.980* :  What can we do? We can only fight and protect our land. I just wanted to stop and
*01:04.100- 01:07.900* :  for our neighbours to go away.
*01:12.220- 01:17.900* :  We start with the exodus of Armenians from Gourner-Karabakh after Azerbaijan's lightning victory
*01:17.900- 01:23.300* :  there last week. Long lines of cars and trucks have been streaming out of the enclave towards
*01:23.500- 01:29.460* :  Armenia itself. The authorities in the capital Yerevan say more than 13,000 people have already
*01:29.460- 01:35.220* :  left their homes, that's approximately 10% of the population, more are on the way. USAID chief
*01:35.220- 01:40.080* :  Samantha Power is on the Armenian border where many are crossing, and she spoke a short time ago.
*01:40.840- 01:49.620* :  As I'm sure many of you have seen the trauma and exhaustion on the faces of so many of the
*01:49.620- 01:58.200* :  people that one encounters here. It is absolutely critical that independent monitors as well as
*01:58.200- 02:07.780* :  humanitarian organizations get access to the people in Gourner-Karabakh who still have dire needs.
*02:08.560- 02:13.360* :  Well Natalia Zotova from BBC Russian is also on the border, and she sent this report.
*02:14.040- 02:20.260* :  The exodus of refugees started late Sunday night.
*02:21.640- 02:27.380* :  Some arrived in the border town of Garis in ambulances, exhausted to week to walk on their own.
*02:28.020- 02:33.780* :  With a few belongings they could transport, families that crossed had lost all hope of ever returning.
*02:40.580- 02:46.500* :  We went to the airport, everyone was collected in one spot, everyone was in a terrible state,
*02:47.160- 02:53.080* :  stressed out, children crying, old people crying, hungry, cold, without enough clothes.
*02:54.180- 02:57.840* :  We, for three years, have been working in this situation.
*02:59.420- 03:05.020* :  Driving closer to the Armenian border with Nagorno-Karabakh, the scale of the evacuation became clear.
*03:06.180- 03:09.820* :  Vehicle after vehicle loaded with belongings and packed full of families.
*03:10.480- 03:15.820* :  Russian peacekeepers we saw were helping refugees cross the border and unload in their bags.
*03:18.160- 03:23.960* :  We are now in the village of Karnitsar, right on the border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.
*03:24.180- 03:27.980* :  We can see the refugees coming and coming through the border to Armenia.
*03:28.620- 03:33.520* :  Here in this tent they are being registered, people are fleeing with their belongings because
*03:33.520- 03:39.420* :  they are afraid they just don't believe they can be safe in Nagorno-Karabakh under Azerbaijan rules.
*03:39.500- 03:44.360* :  And they are being welcomed with basic supplies.
*03:46.680- 03:51.660* :  Police handing bottles of water and biscuits through open-car windows as they drive by.
*03:55.600- 03:59.720* :  Eight workers told us people are in need of food, clothes and medication.
*04:00.540- 04:06.100* :  The impact of one day's war and the nine months blockade imposed on the territory by Azerbaijan.
*04:07.680- 04:11.320* :  Bare essentials were scarce and many towns were plunged into darkness.
*04:12.460- 04:18.980* :  As Azerbaijanis denied it was to target civilians, but say it was to prevent arms being taken into the region.
*04:20.920- 04:27.340* :  This elderly lady fled with her family of six, including her disabled son who crossed the border on crutches.
*04:30.540- 04:32.500* :  How did you cook meals?
*04:35.740- 04:42.380* :  We only picked what we had in the garden. Potatoes, beans, we didn't have bread, flour, nothing.
*04:42.700- 04:49.840* :  Dr Tatyana Agnesyan works with doctors and volunteers of Armenia, who are providing support to those who have just arrived.
*04:54.520- 04:57.460* :  People are malnourished from being in blockade for nine months.
*04:58.240- 05:00.220* :  They are crushed because they have lost their homes.
*05:01.040- 05:04.840* :  We see people who come in unsuitable footwear and just the clothes they had on.
*05:06.060- 05:14.960* :  Armenia says that it will take in older refugees from Karabakh, potentially up to 120,000 people.
*05:15.940- 05:19.800* :  In the 1990s, a different ethnic group fled Nagorno-Karabakh.
*05:20.500- 05:24.220* :  The Azaris haven't lived alongside ethnic Armenians for centuries,
*05:24.860- 05:27.820* :  but forced to leave after the region decided to secede.
*05:28.780- 05:34.340* :  They headed to Azerbaijan, where many of them still live in temporary and often these small conditions.
*05:38.640- 05:41.560* :  For these Armenians today, it's unclear what the future holds.
*05:42.440- 05:47.620* :  Their priority today is sheltering themselves, and the very little belongings they had from the raid.
*05:48.400- 05:51.560* :  Natalia Zatova reporting from the Armenia Azerbaijan border.
*05:52.180- 05:57.700* :  Now, for the first time in three decades, a delegation from Saudi Arabia has arrived in the occupied west bank.
*05:57.700- 05:59.940* :  The group crossed overland from Jordan.
*06:00.460- 06:05.120* :  Saudi's non-resident ambassador was due to meets with the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas,
*06:05.560- 06:08.960* :  who reiterated that no Middle East peace agreement would be possible
*06:08.960- 06:11.680* :  until Palestinians were granted full rights.
*06:12.300- 06:14.680* :  Our Middle East analyst, Mike Thompson, has this report.
*06:15.900- 06:20.600* :  This is the first Saudi Arabian delegation to travel to the occupied west bank
*06:20.600- 06:25.220* :  since the signing in 1993 of the landmark Oslo Accords.
*06:25.620- 06:30.680* :  It's led by the Gulf Kingdom's non-resident ambassador to the Palestinian territories
*06:31.240- 06:34.660* :  Nayef Al-Sudairi, who crossed overland from Jordan.
*06:35.340- 06:40.240* :  After being received by officials in Ramallah, he's to meet with the Palestinian President
*06:40.240- 06:47.060* :  Mahmoud Abbas. The visit comes as U.S. broken talks continue over the potential normalization
*06:47.060- 06:49.960* :  of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia.
*06:50.560- 06:56.700* :  Reed had recently appeared to soften its insistence that any deal must include the creation
*06:56.700- 07:03.060* :  of a Palestinian state. Washington has also called for the revival of a two-state solution
*07:03.060- 07:08.420* :  to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. U.S. officials have warned that any agreement
*07:08.420- 07:15.020* :  expected to include a defense pact with Washington and a civilian nuclear program for Saudi Arabia
*07:15.460- 07:16.940* :  is still some way off.
*07:17.300- 07:22.920* :  Mike Thompson. In Thailand, the law that protects the monarchy there from criticism is back in the spotlight.
*07:22.920- 07:28.320* :  A lawyer-turned-activist has been jailed for four years for insulting the country's royal family.
*07:28.840- 07:33.320* :  What's known is the laissez-majeste law makes some criticism of the monarchy a crime.
*07:33.340- 07:38.620* :  Our correspondent Jonathan Head is in the capital Bangkok. I asked him about human rights lawyer
*07:38.620- 07:44.500* :  Arnon Nampa, who's been sentenced. It's the first conviction for laissez-majeste since unprecedented
*07:45.140- 07:46.760* :  protests against the law three years ago.
*07:47.280- 07:50.780* :  The youthful demonstrators came on the streets and for the first time
*07:51.220- 07:54.720* :  called for reforms to the monarchy. Arnon Nampa was the first man to do this.
*07:54.720- 07:57.940* :  He did it at a protest when he was actually dressed up as Harry Potter.
*07:58.400- 08:03.740* :  At that stage, the protesters were focusing their anger against their military-backed government
*08:03.740- 08:07.660* :  and various other human rights abuses. And he said, actually, if you want change in Thailand,
*08:07.660- 08:12.660* :  you have to talk about the monarchy. The monarchy is officially above politics, but in practice,
*08:12.660- 08:18.720* :  a very powerful and wealthy institution. And that broke the taboo. Young people after that came
*08:18.720- 08:23.820* :  out with more and more bold demands that the monarchy should be changed, that the discussion should
*08:23.820- 08:31.180* :  be had. Those protests petered out and Arnon is among 257 people. It's a record number
*08:31.500- 08:35.500* :  who've been charged under the laissez-majeste law, and as the courts have worked through all the
*08:35.500- 08:40.140* :  various other charges these protest leaders face, he's the first one to be jailed. There'll be
*08:40.140- 08:45.740* :  many others, and he faces a total of 14 charges under this law, and many other charges in addition to
*08:45.740- 08:49.140* :  that. I want to ask you in a minute about the broader political environment and how it's
*08:49.140- 08:53.340* :  changing, but just quickly on the sentence, four years, is that harsh in comparison to others?
*08:54.480- 08:58.940* :  It's not, and I wonder whether the courts were very conscious of the enormous attention
*08:59.380- 09:03.000* :  on this verdict. There were a lot of diplomats there, a lot of media there. Also,
*09:04.000- 09:07.900* :  even the fact that journalists were allowed to observe this trial, a very limited number
*09:07.900- 09:12.960* :  are allowed in, is unusual. Usually, laissez-majeste, the trials are held in secret, journalists aren't
*09:12.960- 09:17.400* :  allowed to see them, and the sentences can be absolutely savage. There's sometimes many decades,
*09:17.400- 09:23.160* :  the record sentence, things about 87 years, although it's routinely cut in half if you plead not guilty.
*09:24.280- 09:29.380* :  And the broader political environment, it's changing, is it? You sense that there is more talk,
*09:29.380- 09:34.720* :  despite the draconian prospect of sentencing here, but more people are talking about the monarchy
*09:34.720- 09:40.700* :  its role and possible reform? Absolutely, and I think the point about this seeing this verdict
*09:40.700- 09:46.040* :  today is the law is still being enforced precisely because people want to talk about it. Remember,
*09:46.040- 09:51.280* :  we had an election just a short time ago in Thailand where a young party won the largest
*09:51.280- 09:56.720* :  sheriff's seats, calling for a discussion about the monarchy. Many of its MPs are facing laissez-majeste
*09:56.720- 10:01.380* :  charges. Now, they were blocked from office exactly because they said this law should be amended.
*10:01.820- 10:06.200* :  So, conservatives are holding the line. We have a now conservative government that probably won't
*10:06.200- 10:10.420* :  allow much discussion, but there's no doubt that among younger ties they do feel the monarchy
*10:10.420- 10:14.740* :  should be talked about and that this law should be changed. Jonathan Head reporting.
*10:15.540- 10:20.440* :  Russia is trying to get back on the United Nations main human rights body. Its membership was
*10:20.440- 10:26.000* :  suspended after the invasion of Ukraine last year. There'll be an election at the UN next month.
*10:26.000- 10:31.600* :  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landel has seen the case that Russia is making for a return to
*10:31.600- 10:36.680* :  the human rights council. After the invasion of Ukraine, the United Nations voted overwhelmingly
*10:36.680- 10:42.420* :  to suspend Russia from its human rights council. But now Russia wants to get back onto the UN's
*10:42.420- 10:48.240* :  main human rights body and is campaigning hard ahead of an election among UN members next month.
*10:48.820- 10:52.560* :  In a position paper obtained by the BBC, Russia promises what it calls
*10:52.560- 10:59.000* :  adequate solutions for human rights issues. This, despite another UN report yesterday,
*10:59.000- 11:05.620* :  outlining Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Diplomats say, despite this, Russia could be elected onto
*11:05.620- 11:11.940* :  the 47 member council in a boost to its global reputation. It is competing with Albania and Bulgaria
*11:11.940- 11:17.420* :  for two seats allocated to Eastern and Central Europe. And Diplomats claim Russia is offering
*11:17.420- 11:23.120* :  countries arms and grain in return for votes. The foreign office of the UK strongly opposed
*11:23.120- 11:27.340* :  Russia's candidacy. The Russian mission at the UN was approached for comment.
*11:28.000- 11:33.500* :  Well, in Ukraine itself, the summer counteroffensive is drawing to a close. Without having made the
*11:33.500- 11:38.740* :  breakthroughs that many Ukrainians and their supporters had hoped for. The army has regained some
*11:38.740- 11:44.600* :  ground, but faces a constant threat from Russian drones, which also continue to attack targets deep
*11:44.600- 11:50.580* :  inside Ukrainian-held territory. The BBC's Mark Urban got access to one brigade fighting in the
*11:50.580- 11:55.260* :  east and saw how they are bracing themselves for a long war with no end in sight.
*11:58.020- 12:01.100* :  In this war, there are the hunted and the hunters.
*12:04.820- 12:11.020* :  The Ukrainians say their Russian enemy has far more drones, which makes camouflage and
*12:11.020- 12:20.400* :  remaining unseen vital. So we were expecting a fire mission within five minutes,
*12:20.400- 12:25.940* :  and then word came down on the radio to stand down because a Russian drone has been cited
*12:26.480- 12:32.200* :  somewhere near here. And that's really very typical of what's been happening. A constant
*12:32.220- 12:39.020* :  battle of wits, a deadly battle of wits. We watched the artillery of the 24th Mechanized Brigade
*12:39.440- 12:44.860* :  as its own drones searched for targets. Then the order came through that they have.
*12:55.380- 13:02.560* :  Once they'd fired, we were told to leave fast. A shell could soon be heading back in our direction.
*13:09.100- 13:14.740* :  We got an inkling of the stresses they're under, but soldiers live under it permanently.
*13:15.680- 13:16.260* :  Where was the incoming?
*13:16.300- 13:25.040* :  Oh yeah, seeing this moment. No date has been set for their demobilization. It's extremely hard
*13:25.040- 13:32.560* :  to live with that. Just how hard we saw at the medical center, where one casualty was
*13:32.580- 13:39.680* :  being brought in. It was described as a panic attack, and even our presence was setting people on
*13:43.900- 13:47.520* :  edge. We've had to leave the medical center because the doctors will worry that our presence at
*13:47.520- 13:58.540* :  the medical center might make it a target. But of course, just as this brigade is being hunted,
*13:59.100- 14:05.080* :  it's also finding its own targets. We joined the drone company as it hunted Russians,
*14:06.380- 14:10.980* :  and they can respond immediately by dropping various kinds of munitions.
*14:17.020- 14:24.380* :  A new machine called an FPV can target the Russians even when they're taking cover inside buildings
*14:24.380- 14:33.400* :  and trenches. Here we have an assortment of FPV drones, so those are different manufacturers,
*14:33.500- 14:39.100* :  some Ukrainian. Two years ago, would you have ever imagined you would be doing this?
*14:39.340- 14:48.620* :  Oh no, no. God say it now. But what can we do? We can only fight and protect our land. I just
*14:48.620- 15:02.360* :  wanted to stop, and for our neighbors to go away. It's this ability to see so much more
*15:03.000- 15:10.000* :  and target it, some call it the transparent battlefield that's made it so hard to take ground here.
*15:13.200- 15:19.120* :  So much so that the men in this brigade are preparing for the autumn and winter ahead.
*15:20.480- 15:21.380* :  Mark Urban reporting.
*15:24.120- 15:29.560* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast, the app that helps blind people envisage the world around them.
*15:29.960- 15:34.320* :  There is a street with parked cars. There is a building with a sign that reads
*15:34.320- 15:39.860* :  taco. There are also trees leading the side to walk into a district and walk in the distance.
*15:49.400- 15:54.660* :  Welcome back. Now, China has hailed an agreement with its neighbors Japan and South Korea
*15:54.980- 15:59.940* :  that the three countries leaders will meet at a convenient time, just after a rare summit of
*15:59.940- 16:06.180* :  senior diplomats to kickstart trilateral exchanges. The foreign ministry in Beijing said the
*16:06.180- 16:11.040* :  three sides also agreed to hold a ministerial meeting in the coming months. All three nations
*16:11.040- 16:15.940* :  are major trading partners, but they have a troubled history with Japan and South Korea
*16:16.380- 16:21.040* :  reaffirming their tilt towards the US more recently. I spoke to our sole correspondent Jean
*16:21.040- 16:25.140* :  Mackenzie and began by asking her what is the significance of these plans.
*16:25.860- 16:30.700* :  Well, they actually used to sit down fairly regularly, Robin, but this kind of trilateral meeting
*16:30.700- 16:37.540* :  was suspended back in 2019 actually because of disputes between South Korea and Japan. But what
*16:37.540- 16:43.120* :  we've seen over the last year is South Korea and Japan really working to mend their own relationships,
*16:43.120- 16:49.340* :  but at the same time really strengthening both of their alliances with the US. But in all this,
*16:49.340- 16:55.560* :  their relationships with China have deteriorated. So we had this landmark summit just last month
*16:55.560- 17:00.180* :  between the United States, South Korea and Japan, where actually the three went further than we
*17:00.180- 17:05.540* :  even expected, and they criticized China for what they said was its reckless behavior in Asia.
*17:06.200- 17:10.620* :  So there has been this kind of real block forming between these three countries,
*17:11.420- 17:14.900* :  and so one South Korean official said to me just ahead of this meeting that actually this is now
*17:14.900- 17:20.020* :  their attempt for South Korea and Japan's attempt to pull China that bit closer to them again.
*17:20.780- 17:25.560* :  That would this be to the benefit of all three nations, or is this kind of meeting and that
*17:25.560- 17:30.580* :  the significance possibly within it at the behest of the Chinese, or at the behest of Tokyo and
*17:30.580- 17:35.940* :  Seoul? I mean, who's got the most again? I think they all have something to gain here,
*17:35.940- 17:40.120* :  and I think they wouldn't be sitting down here today if they didn't. You know, it's easy to say,
*17:40.120- 17:46.820* :  well, actually Tokyo and Seoul need Beijing because Beijing is such a huge trading partner for
*17:46.820- 17:52.820* :  these two countries. I mean, 25% of South Korea's trade is with China, and actually if you take
*17:52.820- 17:59.740* :  Hong Kong into it, it's nearly 35%. But the China's economy is slowing at the moment, and so these three
*17:59.740- 18:05.460* :  countries need to lean on each other economically. But there also is some security at play here as well.
*18:05.860- 18:09.720* :  I mean, if you look at what we've seen in Northeast Asia recently with, as I said, this block
*18:09.720- 18:15.320* :  between South Korea, Japan and the US, you've also got this kind of block forming between Russia,
*18:15.320- 18:21.400* :  North Korea, and China, all of it is slightly more fractured, but South Korea doesn't want this
*18:21.400- 18:26.820* :  pairing because, well, if anything, it believes that China has this influence over North Korea,
*18:27.200- 18:30.200* :  and so if it wants to, it can help keep North Korea in check.
*18:31.140- 18:37.620* :  Jim McKenzie reporting. France is pulling out of Niger after a two-month standoff following a coup
*18:37.620- 18:43.040* :  there. Niger is the fourth former French colony in the Sahel to go through a military uprising
*18:43.080- 18:48.480* :  in just three years. The French ambassador has left the country and French troops are now preparing
*18:48.480- 18:53.860* :  to leave. After President Immanuel Macron said Niger was no longer interested in fighting
*18:53.860- 18:58.920* :  terrorism. Niger is demanding the troops leave in what it calls a negotiated framework,
*18:58.920- 19:04.780* :  and by mutual agreement. Mayany Jones got rare access to Niger, and she sent this report.
*19:44.720- 19:50.760* :  In Yemen, hundreds of protesters are listening to Friday prayers outside the French military base.
*19:51.300- 19:55.860* :  Some have been camped here for weeks. They accuse the French of pillaging the country's
*19:55.860- 20:05.420* :  natural resources and failing to stop the terrorists. In his sermon, Imam Abdulaziz Abdullah
*20:05.420- 20:11.640* :  Ahmadu calls for patience. He explains that just as the voices between spouses take time,
*20:12.300- 20:17.780* :  so will Niger's divorce from France, he blames perceived French hypocrisy for the anger here.
*20:25.420- 20:31.760* :  When he's recognized junters in other countries like Gabon and Chad, that's what has made us
*20:31.760- 20:42.580* :  angry, and we think France takes us for idiots. Also, the prayers is general Abdulazouman Haruna,
*20:42.580- 20:48.840* :  the new governor of Miami, appointed by the junter a month ago. The coup started as an internal
*20:48.840- 20:53.260* :  power struggle, but the junter has benefited from the anti-French sentiment.
*20:59.000- 21:05.180* :  He says the people of Niger want a prosperous, proud and sovereign country, and that outsiders
*21:05.180- 21:10.780* :  should respect their will. When I ask if the junter can keep his country safe from terrorists,
*21:10.860- 21:16.380* :  he replies that Nigerian forces have always protected their people and can do so without foreign
*21:20.960- 21:24.940* :  partners. Niger was the West's strongest ally in the fight against terrorism in the
*21:24.940- 21:31.780* :  Sahel. Both France and the US have over a thousand troops here. Now, like in neighbouring Marley and
*21:31.780- 21:38.020* :  Burkina Faso, French troops are being kicked out, but those opposed to the coup believe France's
*21:38.020- 21:44.180* :  departure could be dangerous. Paris-based Idrisse Wasiri is the former spokesperson of the
*21:44.180- 21:53.600* :  post-President Mohammed Basoum. In the fight against the terrorists, France is a key partner
*21:53.600- 21:58.840* :  that provides most of the intelligence that helps us beat the terrorists trying to attack Niger.
*21:59.240- 22:03.680* :  But many Nigerians are frustrated with the lack of progress in the war on terror.
*22:05.660- 22:10.920* :  Adam Azokilani Maiga lives in a quiet middle-class neighborhood in Yameh with her two children.
*22:11.720- 22:16.520* :  She's originally from Tila Berry, one of the regions worst-affected by Jihadi violence.
*22:20.860- 22:27.120* :  She tells me her mother's cousin, a village chief, was assassinated by terrorists seven months ago.
*22:27.840- 22:30.740* :  They tracked him down and killed him by slitting his throat.
*22:31.020- 22:35.640* :  Do you think that the French have had any impact at all when it's come to
*22:37.160- 22:39.040* :  a helping stop some of this violence?
*22:40.860- 22:47.620* :  French army hasn't had any success, she replies. She adds that every year the situation gets worse.
*22:48.520- 22:55.020* :  There has been some progress last year, terror-related deaths in Niger fell by 79%.
*22:55.600- 23:01.380* :  It's not clear if the French helped, but observers fear political instability could stop this
*23:02.340- 23:07.440* :  and we also saw evidence that freedom of expression has been squashed in the aftermath of the coup.
*23:08.140- 23:13.540* :  We're on our way to the airport in Yameh in the same way that we've struggled to
*23:14.280- 23:19.100* :  reports as freely as we can because the junta follows our every move.
*23:19.420- 23:24.780* :  I also get the sense that many people here can't speak as openly as they'd like to.
*23:24.780- 23:28.400* :  Even if they did oppose the junta, I wanted France to stay a little longer.
*23:29.480- 23:33.340* :  There are certainly even the conditions here for them to be able to tell us that.
*23:34.480- 23:38.700* :  As democracy comes on the threat in the South, it's future looks uncertain.
*23:40.540- 23:42.340* :  Mayany Jones reporting from Niger.
*23:43.100- 23:47.560* :  Latest figures show that the sea ice around Antarctica has shrunk sharply.
*23:48.100- 23:52.460* :  The ice expands and contracts with the seasons, but satellite imagery from NASA
*23:52.920- 23:56.760* :  has shown that its winter coverage in the area around the South Pole this year
*23:57.160- 24:01.280* :  was just over a million square kilometers less than the previous worst year.
*24:01.780- 24:04.700* :  That's equivalent to the size of Egypt, here's Jacob Evans.
*24:05.500- 24:10.640* :  NASA's Snow and Ice Data Center has been keeping a regular record of the sea ice around Antarctica
*24:10.640- 24:16.120* :  since 1979, and now new satellite data has found that the maximum extent the Antarctic
*24:16.120- 24:19.300* :  ice sheet grew to this year is the lowest that has ever been recorded.
*24:19.720- 24:23.320* :  It fell to below 17 million square kilometers for the first time,
*24:23.840- 24:28.240* :  breaking the previous record scene in 1986 by more than 1 million square kilometers.
*24:29.200- 24:32.920* :  Scientists say the sea ice also never fully recovered from its summer shrinkage,
*24:33.140- 24:37.540* :  and this signifies the continuation of a marked downward trend that began in 2016.
*24:38.400- 24:39.380* :  But why is this important?
*24:40.280- 24:42.060* :  Sea ice has frozen ocean water.
*24:42.640- 24:46.360* :  It develops and shrinks entirely in the sea, so unlike when glaciers melt,
*24:46.880- 24:49.840* :  the loss of sea ice doesn't have a drastic impact on sea level rise.
*24:50.300- 24:53.780* :  However, sea ice is incredibly reflective, and when it melts,
*24:53.780- 24:56.500* :  in its place comes very dark ocean water.
*24:57.080- 25:01.440* :  This absorbs more of the sun's heat, and scientists fear this may have larger consequences
*25:01.480- 25:03.920* :  on the Antarctic continent and its ecosystems.
*25:04.960- 25:09.580* :  Now we're going to end with a double chunky look at artificial intelligence.
*25:09.920- 25:15.260* :  First, cases of AI creating songs which mimic the voices and styles of existing artists
*25:15.840- 25:19.720* :  have raised concerns about copyright law and intellectual property theft.
*25:19.720- 25:25.000* :  But the boss of the streaming giant Spotify has told the BBC there is a place in the industry
*25:25.000- 25:26.980* :  for music created by AI.
*25:27.460- 25:31.820* :  Provided he says it does not directly impersonate or mimic existing artists.
*25:32.700- 25:34.660* :  Daniel X said that would be unacceptable.
*25:34.860- 25:38.080* :  He's been speaking to the BBC's technology editor Zoe Kleinman.
*25:38.520- 25:44.900* :  You have so-called deep-fake AI's where someone's impersonating some famous
*25:44.940- 25:49.560* :  artists and our view is obviously that is not positive.
*25:50.060- 25:53.940* :  And we believe that say something in the Drake Weekend case,
*25:53.940- 25:58.040* :  that Drake and Weekend should be able to decide what kind of content they want to put out
*25:58.040- 25:59.360* :  in the world, what they stand for.
*25:59.740- 26:04.400* :  So you have no media plans to ban AI-generated content from the platform?
*26:04.800- 26:06.220* :  No, we have no media plans.
*26:06.220- 26:11.840* :  And in fact, it wouldn't even surprise me that if we look at the top chart of Spotify today,
*26:11.840- 26:17.100* :  that there's legitimate use of AI done by artists and we would allow for them.
*26:17.580- 26:24.220* :  And then there's the one where it's clearly someone trying to steal someone's name or likeness
*26:24.220- 26:29.740* :  or even infringement someone's IP, at which point we would say that is not okay,
*26:29.740- 26:32.400* :  that is not what we stand for and we would take that down.
*26:32.640- 26:36.520* :  You've been very critical of Apple's practices, haven't you, in the past?
*26:36.520- 26:39.900* :  And you still are a critical voice.
*26:40.020- 26:46.660* :  Our beef is really around allowing for level playing fear, not fair playing field.
*26:46.840- 26:49.500* :  Apple decides what innovation goes and doesn't go.
*26:49.640- 26:55.220* :  It taxes all innovation on the internet on this point and it doesn't have to follow the same rules
*26:55.220- 27:01.020* :  themselves. And so what we all we're asking for is they can charge whatever fee they would like
*27:01.540- 27:08.280* :  so long as it was possible for us to not be in their store and download the app onto the iPhone
*27:08.280- 27:13.360* :  anyway. Apple would say that what you're paying for is the security that it provides and
*27:13.360- 27:18.280* :  this enormous audience of iPhone users that it has, it's giving you access to a marketplace
*27:18.280- 27:24.260* :  that nobody else can can access and would argue that it's worth it. What would you say to them?
*27:24.420- 27:30.760* :  Four billion consumers around the world and probably 80% of UK consumers, the primary way they're
*27:30.760- 27:35.520* :  accessing the internet is through their smartphones and the primary way they're accessing the
*27:35.520- 27:42.440* :  internet is through apps on smartphones. And so this is the internet at this point and that's
*27:42.500- 27:47.940* :  why from a principal standpoint it's really important for me. It's an important business issue
*27:48.580- 27:54.820* :  for Spotify but I believe it will be very important for the future innovation and for other
*27:54.820- 28:01.400* :  developers. Spotify is invested a lot in podcasting. You had some big names, you had the abammers,
*28:01.420- 28:07.420* :  you had the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, they released 12 podcasts in two and a half years.
*28:07.420- 28:14.300* :  Was that worth 18 million pounds? We thought new innovation was needed to happen here. We thought
*28:15.080- 28:22.480* :  we can come in and offer a great experience that both makes consumers very happy and allows new
*28:22.480- 28:29.080* :  creators, new avenues to build new podcasts. And we've succeeded with that. Now in part of that we
*28:29.080- 28:35.620* :  also sign lots and lots of new podcasters to this medium. And the truth of the matter is some of it has
*28:35.620- 28:41.960* :  worked, some of it has since. We're learning from those, we're moving on and we wish all the ones
*28:41.960- 28:47.000* :  we didn't renew with the best of success that they can have going forward. That was very diplomatic.
*28:48.280- 28:53.740* :  I'm getting better and better at it so they would tell me. I mean there are artists something
*28:53.740- 28:59.740* :  who say they earn a fraction of a penny per stream of their tune on Spotify. Is it difficult
*28:59.740- 29:06.100* :  to make a living on your platform? Well it's difficult overall. I can safely say there are more
*29:06.100- 29:12.640* :  artists than ever that's being successful on Spotify than ever before in history music. However
*29:13.860- 29:19.940* :  I'm also empathetic because there's also more people trying to make it in music than ever before
*29:19.940- 29:26.580* :  in history too. And you need something extraordinary to break through and be heard. And we're doing
*29:26.580- 29:32.820* :  our part to expose more music to more people. Spotify's boss Daniel Eck speaking to Zoe
*29:32.820- 29:38.860* :  Kleinman. And as promised we are going to stay with AI to wrap up which so many of us are wondering
*29:38.860- 29:44.100* :  if it's going to help us in our lives or maybe threaten us. Well here's an example of something
*29:44.100- 29:50.280* :  very helpful to people who are blind or visually impaired. A new app that uses AI to map out the
*29:50.280- 29:55.100* :  area immediately around someone has been tested by our North America correspondent Sean Dilly who
*29:55.100- 30:01.220* :  is blind. I'm standing in the Northwest quadrant of Washington DC and I want to find out what's
*30:01.220- 30:08.260* :  in front of me so we're going to ask the virtual assistant BMI AI to take a picture. There is a street
*30:08.460- 30:16.200* :  with parked cars beyond the parked cars. There is a building with a sign that reads taco. There are also
*30:16.200- 30:22.240* :  trees lighting the sidewalk and the pedestrian walking in the distance. The weather appears to be
*30:22.240- 30:27.480* :  sunny. So that's what it sounds like but how much of a difference can it actually make? Well Sean has
*30:27.480- 30:33.940* :  been talking to my colleague Justin Webb. It's game changing for me. I was sitting in a cafe that I
*30:33.940- 30:39.880* :  did not know in Washington DC the other week. I took a random picture to play with the new technology
*30:39.880- 30:45.920* :  as I've been one of their beta testers. It not only read the menu items to me and broke the items
*30:45.920- 30:51.140* :  down but it told me where the restrooms were. What the layout of the cafe is but then even in the
*30:51.140- 30:56.760* :  home environments you can take a photo of your cottage pile whatever it is you might want to be
*30:56.760- 31:01.240* :  cooking. It won't only just read you those instructions. You can ask it questions like how long do
*31:01.240- 31:06.600* :  I cook this for or how much salt is in here? It may seem small scale but actually if you think
*31:06.600- 31:11.020* :  about it it's pretty enormous because at the moment there are a lot of tasks that people who
*31:11.020- 31:15.220* :  are blind and visually impaired for instance might need to get help doing that might be from family
*31:15.220- 31:20.120* :  members that might be depending on other health conditions social care. People are always going
*31:20.120- 31:24.580* :  to need to be involved and there's no notion that there wouldn't be but who knows what this
*31:24.980- 31:30.280* :  language model is capable of doing to help people out in life generally. What about its involvement
*31:30.280- 31:37.000* :  of other people who are just around in what it's doing? There are and have been privacy concerns
*31:37.000- 31:43.660* :  indeed during the testing phase of this app. Stop working for about a week and a half when
*31:43.660- 31:49.240* :  there was any photo that included a human face within it. There are questions there will
*31:49.240- 31:53.800* :  continue to be questions in terms of what about the people who don't know they're having their
*31:54.280- 31:58.760* :  photographs taken in the first place and then even beyond that and this is something that all AI
*31:59.380- 32:05.920* :  developers are aware of. What is it allowed to say and for example I mean I took a photo of myself
*32:05.920- 32:10.760* :  in the studio a little while ago. Very good AI actually has to be said because I said am I overweight?
*32:10.760- 32:14.880* :  It's no you appear to be of normal build. I mean I'm not sure whether it's entirely right but
*32:15.240- 32:18.800* :  you know you take the point for example is it allowed to say that someone's a you know a bit
*32:18.800- 32:23.800* :  rotund and is it allowed to say that you aren't Sally as a woman? There are all these things that
*32:24.100- 32:30.480* :  we societally would have genuine questions about and because the way AI's work they dig into the
*32:30.480- 32:36.220* :  internet they dig into blogs they dig into any text they can get hold of. Absolutely if a for
*32:36.220- 32:41.280* :  example a child takes a photo of themselves and says am I pretty the danger is that it could
*32:41.280- 32:45.880* :  draw its information from a more malevolent source and take something altogether less pleasant.
*32:46.800- 32:50.280* :  Sean Dilly a trim Sean Dilly I think on the streets of Washington DC
*32:52.700- 32:56.820* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later.
*32:57.000- 33:01.920* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can send us an email.
*33:01.920- 33:09.040* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on ex formerly known as Twitter
*33:09.040- 33:14.760* :  at global news pod. This edition was mixed by Lewis Allsop and Gabriel O'Regan the producer was
*33:14.760- 33:19.440* :  Lippaker Pellum the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Robyn Brandt until next time thanks for listening
*33:19.440- 33:19.880* :  and goodbye.
