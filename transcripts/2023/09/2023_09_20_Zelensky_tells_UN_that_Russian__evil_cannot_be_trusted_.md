*01:12.520- 01:15.480* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:18.600- 01:23.860* :  I'm Robin Brant and in the early hours of Wednesday 20 September, these are our main stories.
*01:23.860- 01:30.300* :  President Zelensky has warned that Russia is a threat to the whole world, in his first in-person
*01:30.300- 01:35.980* :  speech at the UN General Assembly since the invasion of Ukraine. As Abijan has said it won't
*01:35.980- 01:41.940* :  stop its assault on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, until ethnic Armenian separatists
*01:42.140- 01:47.720* :  surrender. One of Colombia's largest remaining rebel groups has agreed to a ceasefire and
*01:47.720- 01:58.040* :  renew peace talks. Also in this podcast, only a very small fraction of the Missile Mutations are
*01:58.040- 02:05.440* :  known to be either benign or defecosing. With our model that proportion goes to 89 percent,
*02:05.840- 02:11.600* :  researchers have developed a tool that uses artificial intelligence to identify DNA mutations
*02:11.600- 02:21.680* :  that might cause diseases. First, Ukraine's president Vladimir Zelensky has warned world leaders
*02:21.680- 02:27.240* :  that Russia's invasion of his country is a grave threat to the whole world. He was making his
*02:27.240- 02:33.140* :  first speech in-person at the UN General Assembly since Moscow's full-scale attack began last year.
*02:33.600- 02:39.100* :  President Zelensky urged the U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies president to remain
*02:39.100- 02:47.700* :  united in backing Ukraine to ensure its victory. We have to stop it. We must act united to defeat
*02:47.700- 02:56.040* :  the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges as
*02:56.040- 03:02.580* :  New York's are restrained. Likewise, the aggressor must be restrained and all his tools and
*03:02.580- 03:10.760* :  methods of war. Each war now can become final, but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression
*03:10.760- 03:17.180* :  will not break in again. Well, a short time before that, President Biden had warned the world leaders
*03:17.180- 03:21.880* :  at the UN meeting to resist what he called Russia's naked aggression in Ukraine.
*03:22.420- 03:27.440* :  We have to stand up to this naked aggression today and deter other would be aggressors tomorrow.
*03:28.880- 03:32.640* :  That's why the United States, together with our allies and partners around the world,
*03:32.640- 03:37.020* :  will continue to stand with the brave people who Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty,
*03:37.020- 03:43.480* :  antiretorial integrity, and their freedom. But the audience for his address was missing notable
*03:43.480- 03:48.280* :  counterparts with France, the United Kingdom, and Russia, all not sending their leaders.
*03:49.040- 03:53.760* :  I spoke to the BBC's Nutter Taufik, who's in New York, and asked her, did it help?
*03:53.760- 03:59.200* :  The Mr. Zelensky was actually there in person. Well, I mean, you can certainly tell that,
*03:59.200- 04:03.840* :  you know, attention was going to be high and certainly was. I mean, even when he came in to the
*04:03.840- 04:08.140* :  UN General Assembly, there was a swarm of press. He's been doing the press round several
*04:08.140- 04:13.820* :  interviews since he's been here. He got a standing ovation before and after his speech. So,
*04:13.820- 04:19.600* :  I think him being here in person has certainly highlighted what he has to say. It's given him
*04:20.000- 04:25.760* :  that real platform. But as you say, it was a very familiar message. What he did note was that he
*04:25.760- 04:32.220* :  is going to outline details of his peace proposal and a security council meeting. But we saw him
*04:32.220- 04:37.020* :  holding bilateral meetings with the likes of South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaposa,
*04:37.440- 04:43.500* :  and others who haven't been as outright in condemning Russia for its invasion. So, I think
*04:43.960- 04:48.360* :  him being in person, being able to speak face to face with these people, he's hoping it does have
*04:48.360- 04:54.180* :  an impact. There is other topics clearly, climate, I think, sustainable development goals. But
*04:54.180- 04:59.480* :  is the truth that this meeting is all Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine? Well, certainly the next several days
*04:59.560- 05:03.560* :  there are going to be attention on President Zelensky's movement. As I mentioned, the security
*05:03.560- 05:08.000* :  council meeting then he goes off to the White House on Thursday to meet with Joe Biden there
*05:08.000- 05:13.100* :  and congressional leaders who are a bit conflicted on the Republican side about continued aid.
*05:13.100- 05:18.580* :  So, I think we're going to see eyes focused on him, but we really have been seeing leaders and
*05:18.580- 05:22.820* :  others focusing on things like climate and it is getting a decent amount of attention here.
*05:23.040- 05:29.600* :  Netotovic in New York. As Abijan says it will continue its military assault on Nagorno-Karabakh
*05:30.020- 05:35.720* :  until Armenian separatists there surrender. Officials in the disputed territories say 25
*05:35.720- 05:40.760* :  people have been killed and more than 80 injured since fighting broke out early on Tuesday.
*05:41.380- 05:46.900* :  As Abijani forces have launched artillery, missile and drone attacks in the breakaway enclave,
*05:47.420- 05:54.360* :  which is recognised internationally as part of Abijan. As Abijan insists it was forced to take action
*05:54.360- 06:00.140* :  after six of its citizens were blown up by landmines. But a spokesperson for the administration
*06:00.140- 06:06.620* :  running the enclave, Gegem Stepanian, said as Abijan wants to ethnically cleanse Armenians from
*06:06.620- 06:13.500* :  the territory. Azerbaijan is using all kinds of weaponry starting from artillery rockets, UAVs.
*06:13.500- 06:19.700* :  They are targeting not only a military object but also civilian communities. They are calling
*06:19.700- 06:26.980* :  this attack counter terrorism operation but this is nothing else than a bloody stage of Azerbaijan
*06:26.980- 06:33.380* :  genocide or poison. Well for more on this brewing conflict I heard from our caucuses correspondent
*06:33.380- 06:41.080* :  Ray Handimitri. It's increasingly looking like it's a major military operation taking place in Nagorno-Karabakh.
*06:41.620- 06:48.320* :  Azerbaijan has launched what it described as an anti-terror operation and it looks like Azerbaijan is
*06:48.320- 06:56.140* :  determined to establish full control of its breakaway region populated by 120,000 ethnic Armenians.
*06:56.400- 07:02.120* :  We're trying to piece together the picture of what's happening and that of course we're looking
*07:02.120- 07:07.640* :  at social media and the videos that are being posted. So there are reports of casualties among
*07:07.640- 07:14.960* :  the civilian population including children and one video which I saw showed the main hospital
*07:14.960- 07:21.020* :  in Stepanakert which is the regional capital showing a kind of chaotic scenes and more injured
*07:21.020- 07:27.560* :  people being delivered there. However Azerbaijan claims that it is specifically targeting only
*07:27.560- 07:34.620* :  a military infrastructure. It issued a warning to the ethnic Armenian population asking them to
*07:34.620- 07:40.780* :  seek cover and saying that they will not be harmed. Armenia is describing this as ethnic cleansing
*07:40.780- 07:47.380* :  and it says that the aim of this military offensive by Azerbaijan is to drive ethnic Armenians
*07:47.380- 07:52.500* :  out of the territory. So can you just clarify, despite as Azerbaijan saying it is targeting
*07:52.500- 07:57.560* :  military installations, it gave a warning as you just reported, there are some reports of civilian
*07:57.560- 08:02.840* :  casualties that include children. That's correct. Yes, civilian casualties and that number is rising
*08:02.840- 08:09.900* :  so it's really difficult to say how many are now the latest figure I saw was 25 and two of
*08:11.180- 08:17.320* :  civilian casualties. There has been a growing international pressure on Azerbaijan from the EU foreign
*08:17.320- 08:23.660* :  policy chief from the German chancellor and a number of other European nations and they're all
*08:23.660- 08:29.640* :  calling on Azerbaijan to immediately stop its military offensive and return to the negotiations.
*08:29.640- 08:36.480* :  They're saying that Baku should talk directly with Karabakh Armenians but Baku is saying that it
*08:36.480- 08:43.900* :  is ready to hold talks on its territory with representatives of the Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*08:44.260- 08:52.340* :  However, it says that it will continue its anti-terror operation until the local government which
*08:52.340- 09:00.300* :  it calls a puppet regime in Stepanakert, Surenders and Disarms fully. Rayhanda Mitri, a former member
*09:00.300- 09:06.420* :  of Belarus's security forces, has told a Swiss court how his unit abducted three opposition
*09:06.420- 09:12.660* :  activists in 1999 before killing them. At his trial, Yuriy Gharavsky said he was involved in
*09:12.660- 09:17.860* :  snatching the men from the streets of Minsk but he told the court several times that he was not
*09:17.860- 09:23.660* :  the gunman. Sarah Reinsford has more. Yuriy Gharavsky arrived in court with police protection
*09:23.660- 09:28.640* :  and his foot pulled down low over his eyes because he says the testimony he's giving here
*09:28.900- 09:34.180* :  has put his own life in danger. The former special forces soldier has confessed to taking part in
*09:34.180- 09:40.880* :  the abduction of three men in Belarus in 1999 or three were killed. They were opponents of Alexander
*09:40.880- 09:46.380* :  Lukashenko who was then tightening his grip on power. Today, two daughters of the disappeared,
*09:46.380- 09:51.340* :  sat and hugs in the front row. Just meters from the man who described how his secret unit had
*09:51.340- 09:56.320* :  snatched their fathers from the streets of Minsk. He said both had been killed with two shots each
*09:56.320- 10:01.280* :  to the back. We're going to go to Libya now where the World Health Organization says more than
*10:01.280- 10:06.560* :  four hundred migrants are among those who'd lost their lives in last week's devastating floods
*10:06.560- 10:11.220* :  in the east of the country. The organization said the figure came from deaths reported by
*10:11.220- 10:17.260* :  Libyan hospitals. Thousands of African and Middle Eastern migrants are temporarily based in Libya
*10:17.780- 10:22.480* :  with many hoping to reach Europe from there. Estimates of the overall number of people who died in
*10:22.480- 10:29.380* :  the storm very widely. But hospital reports put the figure at around 4,000. Many died in the coastal
*10:29.380- 10:35.500* :  city of Dernar where torrential rain caused two dams to collapse, triggering catastrophic flooding.
*10:36.060- 10:41.000* :  On Monday, the house of the ousted mayor of the city was torched and there were large protests.
*10:41.760- 10:46.600* :  Now journalists are being told to stay away from Dernar. Rebecca Kesby spoke to the BBC's
*10:46.600- 10:51.480* :  Anna Foster on Tuesday. She's one of those who had been in the city but was asked to leave.
*10:51.860- 10:57.820* :  What we've been operating in Dernar for several days now and we've noticed as more and more
*10:57.820- 11:02.560* :  journalists have arrived, it has become a little more difficult in terms of getting permission
*11:02.600- 11:07.380* :  to go in and operate in the city. We heard late last night a rumor that the journalists weren't
*11:07.380- 11:12.960* :  going to be allowed to operate in Dernar anymore and in fact that was the case today. Local journalists,
*11:12.960- 11:18.080* :  international journalists were asked to leave. I think the timing is quite interesting because
*11:18.420- 11:23.540* :  there were protests in Dernar last night. The protests against the Eastern-based administration,
*11:23.660- 11:28.980* :  people very unhappy with their leadership, feeling like they failed when it came to things like
*11:28.980- 11:33.840* :  maintaining those dams that burst and allowed all of that water to flow through Dernar,
*11:33.840- 11:39.700* :  washing so much a bit away. And then less than 24 hours later we see this crack down on reporting
*11:39.700- 11:44.920* :  from the city. We saw a real communications blackout this morning. You know, areas that we were
*11:44.920- 11:51.620* :  moving through that had had patchy but existent phone reception and data were now completely out
*11:51.620- 11:56.840* :  of contact and really now we're sort of waiting and watching to see what the authorities will do.
*11:56.840- 12:01.460* :  They said that there were too many people in Dernar hampering the recovery effort. That was their
*12:01.460- 12:06.040* :  excuse for doing this. So we're looked to see whether this is something that changes that goes
*12:06.040- 12:11.220* :  back in the next few days or whether indeed they are trying to seal this city off when it comes
*12:11.220- 12:16.640* :  to reporting and to finding out what's going on in there. What's been your experience with local
*12:16.640- 12:20.360* :  people when you've been talking to them? Have they been happy that you've been there to report
*12:20.360- 12:27.140* :  the story? In situations like their city often people they appreciate the opportunity to actually
*12:27.140- 12:32.060* :  talk about what has happened to them and to let the wider world know what has happened to them.
*12:32.060- 12:36.800* :  And of course when people don't we sort of leave them in peace. I don't feel like I've seen
*12:37.440- 12:42.380* :  journalists particularly getting underfoot. I mean there have been a lot of volunteer workers as
*12:42.380- 12:47.780* :  well. People from different parts of Libya who've come across and who've been involved in that
*12:47.780- 12:55.440* :  recovery effort including people who have come from the West from Tripoli and there are some
*12:55.440- 13:00.340* :  suggestions. Again I don't know how much truth there is in this that now perhaps the Eastern
*13:00.340- 13:06.180* :  based authorities don't want people from the West to be here anymore given that split that
*13:06.180- 13:10.220* :  there is in Libya given that you have these two rival administrations that they perhaps have
*13:10.520- 13:16.880* :  accepted that early help but they want to try and return to the old order a little bit now.
*13:17.160- 13:22.980* :  Anna Foster in Libya. Japan has long been engaged in a struggle to provide for its aging population.
*13:22.980- 13:29.160* :  It has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. Just how acute the problem is is illustrated by
*13:29.160- 13:34.840* :  new data which for the first time shows that more than one in ten people in Japan are now aged 80
*13:34.840- 13:41.080* :  or over. Tim Franks spoke to Dr Paul Mauland, a demographer and author of the forthcoming book
*13:41.080- 13:46.780* :  Procreate or Parish. Well the Japanese Prime Minister has talked about civilizational collapse
*13:47.480- 13:54.140* :  and I think we have to give him the credit for knowing what he's talking about. Japan is at the
*13:54.140- 13:58.660* :  cutting edge of what the rest of the world is heading for which is what happens when you've had
*13:58.660- 14:05.920* :  50 or 60 years of too few births and significantly too few in the case of Japan and an extending life
*14:05.920- 14:11.380* :  expectancy we should celebrate the extending life expectancy and the Japanese have done a fantastic
*14:11.380- 14:16.660* :  job at keeping people alive but if you're not having the children to support that aging population
*14:16.780- 14:22.620* :  it's going to be a disaster. And the turnaround in figures is utterly stark isn't it? I mean I was
*14:22.780- 14:27.080* :  reading I think the figures are from some research that you've done but about you know the number
*14:27.080- 14:32.560* :  of young people there were for every elderly person back in the 60s and and how that has changed.
*14:33.000- 14:37.900* :  Yes when Japan hit a hundred million people back in the mid 60s there were five or six workers
*14:38.380- 14:43.400* :  for everyone over age day of 60 when it gets back to a hundred million on the way down
*14:43.400- 14:49.560* :  which is going to be in the 2050s there's going to be less than one person in their 20s to 60s to
*14:49.560- 14:55.560* :  everyone over 60. How a society like that is going to function where you have less than one person
*14:55.560- 15:01.800* :  in work for every one retiree it's very hard to fathom. What are the answers? I mean how far are
*15:01.800- 15:06.840* :  countries such as Japan looking at other possible solutions like encouraging immigration?
*15:07.300- 15:11.640* :  Migration has been an incredibly important part of the picture for countries in Europe that are
*15:11.640- 15:17.420* :  prepared to undergo rapid ethnic change. Japan is not prepared to do that and Japan is a very
*15:17.420- 15:22.380* :  distant and obscure culture for people in the high fertility parts of the world it's not somewhere
*15:22.380- 15:27.280* :  they understand it's not somewhere they have communities and mass immigration is not wanted in Japan
*15:27.920- 15:32.100* :  and even for those of us in countries like Britain that have had mass immigration we have to
*15:32.100- 15:37.020* :  realize that the fertility rates are dropping in countries like Poland where we've traditionally
*15:37.020- 15:42.480* :  recruited people from so we're just moving pieces around on the chess board for Japan the only
*15:42.480- 15:48.660* :  answer is to increase its birth rate its fertility rate per woman and that requires not just government
*15:48.660- 15:54.040* :  policy and the government has been trying but a complete cultural turnaround right and I guess the
*15:54.040- 15:59.180* :  issue I mean you know for people such as you who study these things it's not just that this is
*15:59.500- 16:03.960* :  sort of a pressing need right now but I mean it's something that's going to need quite a sustained
*16:03.960- 16:09.400* :  effort because presumably demographic trends and not something that you sort of you change in an
*16:09.400- 16:14.820* :  instant no even if Japan's women now started having larger families there are so few young women
*16:14.820- 16:20.580* :  of fertile years in Japan it's going to take a very long time to turn around and that's because
*16:20.580- 16:26.200* :  we've been sailing into this iceberg for 50 or 60 years and paying it almost no attention
*16:26.800- 16:36.020* :  the demographer Paul Mawland still to come sometimes I can collapse I can lose my sight in a
*16:36.020- 16:43.740* :  flash I can have a consistent pain that goes on for days on end we look at the debilitating condition
*16:43.740- 16:48.600* :  of migraine after another sufferer said she was resigning as a British government minister
*16:49.140- 16:51.320* :  because migraine's meant she couldn't do her job properly

*19:33.080- 19:39.720* :  all casualties while the violence in Manipur started in early May it only really came into
*19:40.240- 19:47.680* :  the national as well as the international spotlight in late July when a video was circulated on
*19:47.680- 19:54.160* :  social media which showed two women being paraded around naked by a mob of men and the younger
*19:54.160- 20:03.760* :  woman in her twenties was allegedly gang raped afterwards i'm about to meet the mother of the

*20:30.480- 20:36.800* :  brutally beaten with rods they were killed in front of my daughter what we are seeing on both sides
*20:36.800- 20:42.180* :  of this conflict in Manipur are civilians telling us that they feel like they have to pick up weapons
*20:42.180- 20:49.360* :  to protect themselves their families their villages their community i'm at a bunker on the kooky side
*20:49.360- 20:56.040* :  and it's essentially just a makeshift shed which has been propped up with bamboo sticks and it has
*20:56.040- 21:02.500* :  thin sheet for a roof there are three people in front of me there who have guns and they're
*21:02.500- 21:07.760* :  pointing towards the other side which is the mighty side one man who works as a laborer told us
*21:07.760- 21:17.080* :  why he was there it's up to us to defend ourselves now we have no evil intentions we do not want
*21:17.080- 21:22.900* :  violence but this has become necessary now because we don't trust the police or other security

*22:59.420- 23:04.340* :  ground even though both the regional government of Manipur and the national government of India
*23:04.340- 23:10.020* :  are run by Mr Modi's party Yogi Teh Limai reporting from India's northeast

*24:06.660- 24:12.360* :  with your sight all these are symptoms of migraine a type of headache which can be so debilitating
*24:12.360- 24:17.360* :  that people find it impossible to do their job and this week a British member of parliament
*24:17.360- 24:23.460* :  Dehina Davison resigned in her job as a government minister saying chronic migraines have made it
*24:23.460- 24:29.360* :  impossible to do that job but what's it like having chronic migraines and how does it affect your
*24:29.360- 24:35.340* :  life James Reynolds spoke to two people who suffer from the condition Kerry Sporling from Leicestershire
*24:35.640- 24:42.620* :  in central England and Cynthia Camuna from Nairobi in Kenya first Cynthia and some people may find
*24:42.620- 24:50.140* :  the following distressing several things happen so sometimes I can collapse I can lose my sight
*24:50.140- 24:58.860* :  in a flash I can have a consistent pain that goes on for days on end one of the examples I could
*24:58.860- 25:07.540* :  share is I've had once a migraine that went for about 31 days of consistent pain without any ease
*25:07.700- 25:14.320* :  so it's crippling it affects your work it affects your social life it affects your way of life
*25:14.560- 25:21.500* :  and it's it's not an easy issue to deal with especially if you're working in a very easy environment
*25:22.120- 25:27.560* :  it sounds terrible particularly that 30 odd day attack that you had and let's bring in Kerry
*25:27.560- 25:33.340* :  here in England you've just heard Cynthia describe the excruciating pain that she
*25:33.340- 25:40.140* :  goes through how is it for you actually there's several different types of migraine that people
*25:40.140- 25:48.400* :  can suffer from I'm a vestibular migraine patient which all sounds very familiar to the other
*25:48.620- 25:56.460* :  sufferer that's just been talking I get persistent vertigo as well so I have vertigo where it feels
*25:56.460- 26:03.400* :  like it's spinning on the inside of my body and on the outside of my body which then causes me
*26:03.400- 26:09.860* :  to vomit constantly and that can last for days on end I think the Lochongus bout of had is like
*26:10.180- 26:18.040* :  seven days literally vomiting night and day my tax can last anywhere up to six weeks at a time I
*26:18.040- 26:24.640* :  also go blind I have to stay in a dark room I can't bear any light at all I can't bear any noise
*26:25.320- 26:31.420* :  at all so I just become completely debilitated in bed and completely isolated from the world
*26:31.420- 26:39.800* :  unable to work socialize and basically you know get out of bed well vivid descriptions there of
*26:39.800- 26:45.140* :  severe symptoms from migraine sufferers Kerry spoulding here in England and before her
*26:45.140- 26:51.900* :  Cynthia Camuna from Nairobi in Kenya now the artificial intelligence company Google DeepMind has
*26:51.900- 26:58.480* :  used its technology to identify mutations in human DNA that might cause diseases the development
*26:58.480- 27:04.280* :  is expected to speed up efforts to find new more effective drugs for conditions such as brain
*27:04.280- 27:11.160* :  disorders heart disease and cancer our science correspondent Palab Gosh has more our DNA contains
*27:11.160- 27:17.320* :  the information to build bodies it contains repeated blocks of chemicals known by the initials
*27:17.600- 27:24.200* :  AC, T and G and they have to be in a particular sequence if there's a mistake in the order of the
*27:24.200- 27:29.780* :  letters it can lead to a faulty gene and cause disease but there are billions of these blocks
*27:29.780- 27:36.840* :  and so far scientists have identified a tiny fraction of the changes in order that lead to disease
*27:37.400- 27:43.640* :  experts at Google DeepMind have developed an AI tool called alpha missense that's about to
*27:43.640- 27:49.720* :  make the search for faulty genes or mutations much easier pushmeat coley is in charge of the
*27:49.720- 27:56.900* :  firm's drive to develop AI tools for science the knowledge that we have acquired till now is
*27:56.900- 28:04.440* :  fairly limited only a very small fraction 0.1 percent of the missense mutations are known to be
*28:04.440- 28:12.920* :  either benign or deweaf causing with our model that proportion goes to 89 percent DNA leads to
*28:12.920- 28:19.140* :  the creation of the body's building blocks which are called proteins last year Google DeepMind's
*28:19.140- 28:25.420* :  AI worked out the shape of nearly all of them the new system can tell if the letters in the DNA
*28:25.420- 28:32.720* :  will produce the correct shape if not it's listed as potentially disease causing Palab Gosh reporting
*28:35.460- 28:39.840* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later
