01:43.700 - 01:48.580:  I'm Garith Barlow and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 13th of September.
01:48.580 - 01:54.120:  These are our main stories, more than 5,000 people have died, with thousands more still missing
01:54.120 - 01:56.580:  after devastating floods in the east of Libya.
01:57.220 - 02:01.500:  President Putin has promised help for North Korea's space programme during a meeting with
02:01.500 - 02:03.660:  Kim Jong Un at a Russian Cosmodrome.
02:04.220 - 02:08.940:  And aid agencies are racing against time to save earthquake survivors in remote regions
02:08.940 - 02:10.520:  of the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.
02:12.740 - 02:13.620:  Also in the podcast?
02:15.820 - 02:18.680:  Dear listener, I hope this email finds you well.
02:21.240 - 02:25.180:  Your research suggests formal email language may be close to extinction.
02:28.380 - 02:33.020:  We begin the podcast in Libya where floods have devastated the eastern part of the country,
02:33.020 - 02:37.040:  described by the United Nations as a calamity of epic proportions.
02:37.660 - 02:43.180:  At the time of recording this podcast, officials say more than 5,000 people have died, with thousands
02:43.180 - 02:44.380:  of others still missing.
02:44.380 - 02:48.800:  The port city of Dernab witnessed the worst destruction, heavy rains and the collapse
02:48.800 - 02:53.000:  of two dams along with four bridges submerged much of the city.
02:53.480 - 02:55.200:  Our correspondent, Joinwood reports.
02:58.240 - 02:59.820:  Nothing could resist the waters.
03:00.620 - 03:06.320:  As the river Dernab swelled, then broke its banks, entire districts of the city were washed
03:06.320 - 03:07.100:  into the sea.
03:07.880 - 03:10.500:  Those caught in its path didn't stand a chance.
03:13.980 - 03:18.080:  Before we were asleep and no one was ready, my whole family lived next door to each other.
03:18.420 - 03:19.320:  We were all neighbours.
03:19.840 - 03:23.680:  We lost 30 people so far, 30 members of the same family.
03:24.120 - 03:25.100:  We haven't found anyone.
03:26.160 - 03:32.300:  From above, you can see the devastation done to this city, more than 100,000 people used
03:32.340 - 03:32.940:  to live here.
03:33.920 - 03:38.620:  A stormed annual swept across North Africa, it dropped a huge amount of water onto the
03:38.620 - 03:42.740:  hills, swelling the river Dernab and causing two dams to burst.
03:44.100 - 03:45.620:  But why was it so powerful?
03:46.220 - 03:49.220:  Daniel is an example of a Mediterranean cyclone.
03:49.500 - 03:54.500:  These are initiated by the jet stream which brings cold air high above the earth's surface.
03:54.500 - 03:56.320:  That starts off these thunderstorms.
03:56.660 - 04:00.520:  Once that's formed, the area of low pressure develops and that feeds off the warm waters
04:00.520 - 04:05.260:  in the Mediterranean with the system taking on characteristics more like a tropical storm.
04:08.060 - 04:11.020:  The damage to Libya's infrastructure is incalculable.
04:11.920 - 04:14.900:  This hospital in Baida was submerged in the deluge.
04:15.740 - 04:21.580:  All the while the death toll mounts, mass graves filling up hospitals turning into morgues.
04:25.320 - 04:29.100:  We've already had 1700 dead just in this section of the hospital.
04:29.700 - 04:31.640:  We counted them as they were lying in the hallways.
04:32.340 - 04:35.000:  We buried anyone identified by their family or friends.
04:35.860 - 04:36.860:  Things are very bad.
04:36.900 - 04:38.820:  The hospital is dilapidated.
04:40.960 - 04:42.880:  The road made is already on its way.
04:43.480 - 04:49.360:  But with relief operations already stretched by the earthquake in nearby Morocco, help will
04:49.360 - 04:52.540:  not come as fast as the needs here will grow.
04:52.920 - 04:57.420:  And rescue efforts have been hampered with the country's split between rival governments
04:57.420 - 05:02.840:  with Libya's fragile and complex political situation laid bare by this disaster.
05:03.240 - 05:05.160:  Frank Gardner is our security correspondent.
05:05.740 - 05:08.640:  The beer ought to be a real success story.
05:08.980 - 05:12.240:  It's got a small population, a hugely rich hydrocarbon sector.
05:12.240 - 05:13.820:  It's on the shores of the Mediterranean.
05:14.880 - 05:16.700:  It ought to be a great success.
05:16.960 - 05:17.780:  And yet it isn't.
05:17.960 - 05:23.340:  Because for 42 years it was under the brutal repressive regime of Colonel Gaddafi, which
05:23.340 - 05:27.960:  essentially crushed or basically got rid of anything that resembled a government institution.
05:27.980 - 05:31.980:  Libbyns used to lecture me and say, you see Mr. Gardner, we have no government here.
05:31.980 - 05:32.640:  We don't need government.
05:32.640 - 05:33.360:  The people rule.
05:33.860 - 05:34.460:  He didn't.
05:34.580 - 05:38.820:  Gaddafi and his close henchman ruled that country with an arm fist.
05:39.300 - 05:43.200:  When that was swept away by the Arab Spring of 2011, it left a vacuum.
05:43.680 - 05:49.240:  And that has been filled by competing warlord, tribal factions, Islamists, and really it
05:49.240 - 05:50.260:  became the rule of the gun.
05:50.640 - 05:55.440:  And what you've got now is two rival governments, one in Tripoli that is the internationally recognized
05:55.440 - 05:59.260:  so-called government of national unity that's backed by most western countries.
05:59.940 - 06:03.800:  And then in the east you've got what's called the national parliament, which sounds very
06:03.800 - 06:09.180:  democratic, but the ultimate power here is a warlord called Khalifa Aftar, who is backed
06:09.180 - 06:12.220:  by Russia, UAE, Egypt, and others.
06:12.980 - 06:20.040:  What that means is that the normal business of maintaining storm drains, the dam, safety
06:20.040 - 06:26.140:  systems, checks, surveillance of anything that could go wrong like this simply just falls
06:26.200 - 06:26.460:  away.
06:26.700 - 06:27.840:  It takes second priority.
06:28.460 - 06:30.300:  The voice there of Frank Gaddafi.
06:30.900 - 06:35.940:  With his mammoth two-day journey, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has finished his
06:35.940 - 06:40.060:  talks in Russia with President Putin and is now on his way back home.
06:40.680 - 06:43.620:  There's precious little detail about what the two men discussed.
06:43.620 - 06:48.460:  A Kremlin spokesperson said only that Russia would strengthen cooperation with North Korea
06:49.000 - 06:53.140:  on all fronts and saw the prospect of working more closely together in space.
06:53.900 - 06:58.380:  Mr Kim, for his part, told his host that the two countries had the shared aim of fighting
06:58.380 - 06:59.160:  imperialism.
07:01.400 - 07:06.980:  Russia is now in the sacred fight against hegemonic forces in order to protect its sovereignty
07:06.980 - 07:08.520:  and security interests.
07:09.360 - 07:14.960:  We have constantly expressed our full and unconditional support for all the decisions taken
07:14.960 - 07:20.020:  by the President and the Russia leadership, and I want to assure you that we will always
07:20.020 - 07:23.300:  be together with Russia in the fight against imperialism.
07:25.520 - 07:28.540:  For more on this, I spoke to our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg.
07:28.700 - 07:34.420:  It was interesting when Kim and Putin actually sat down to begin their talks, and we heard
07:34.420 - 07:36.140:  their public comments to camera.
07:36.720 - 07:40.200:  Vladimir Putin said we're going to talk about economic cooperation, we're going to talk
07:40.200 - 07:41.580:  about humanitarian issues.
07:42.280 - 07:48.320:  But he just given his guest a guided tour of Russia's most modern cosmodrome, modern
07:48.320 - 07:54.060:  space port, showing Kim Jong-un, launch pads and Russian rockets, so it would be logical
07:54.060 - 07:55.160:  to assume, wouldn't it?
07:55.540 - 07:59.940:  That on the agenda too would be cooperation in space, and we know that that's something
07:59.940 - 08:05.660:  which is a major interest to Kim, who has tried twice and failed twice to launch his
08:05.660 - 08:07.360:  own military spy satellite.
08:07.360 - 08:12.980:  But also at those talks, the Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shogu, who was in Pyongyang
08:12.980 - 08:16.140:  a couple of months ago looking at North Korean weaponry.
08:16.140 - 08:23.480:  So again, that brings us back to America's suspicion that Russia and North Korea are close
08:23.480 - 08:28.280:  to, or perhaps have already agreed, we don't know, some kind of arms deal that would provide
08:28.280 - 08:34.960:  Russia with a large amount of munitions, possibly ammunition, possibly artillery shells, to help
08:34.960 - 08:40.760:  Russia's war in Ukraine, in return for something going to North Korea, whether that's something
08:40.760 - 08:46.260:  be humanitarian aid or cash or advanced military technologies, we don't know.
08:46.700 - 08:50.200:  And we possibly won't know, we won't be told, there's going to be no press conference,
08:50.320 - 08:55.280:  there'll be no signing of documents, no big ceremony, a lot of what's agreed of this
08:55.280 - 08:58.040:  meeting I think will remain rather secret.
08:58.560 - 09:04.760:  They are both without doubt pretty savvy operators, it strikes me that, like you say, Pyongyang
09:04.760 - 09:10.500:  will have its wishlist too, but the President Putin will be a pains to ensure that he doesn't
09:10.500 - 09:16.180:  send any tech to Pyongyang that might further make his near-neighbor more dangerous or
09:16.180 - 09:17.560:  potentially destabilize it.
09:17.980 - 09:23.340:  That's right, and also China probably won't appreciate too much going to North Korea,
09:23.760 - 09:25.080:  we have to keep that in mind.
09:25.560 - 09:28.580:  But I think they say that location is everything, don't they, Gareth?
09:28.780 - 09:33.920:  And I think that the fact that this is happening at the Cosmodrome, right, at Russia's most
09:33.920 - 09:39.580:  modern space center, the fact that Kim took two days in a train to get there, I think that's
09:39.960 - 09:40.180:  significant.
09:40.180 - 09:45.360:  I think what Vladimir Putin is doing is sending a signal to Washington, actually, that
09:45.360 - 09:49.540:  you know, look, with me I've got my guest, Kim, who's rather keen on getting his hands
09:49.580 - 09:55.980:  on advanced military technology to help develop his space program, to help develop perhaps
09:55.980 - 10:00.880:  his missile program too, just the kind of advanced technology that the Kremlin happens
10:00.880 - 10:01.340:  to have.
10:01.660 - 10:02.280:  Hint, hint.
10:02.740 - 10:06.900:  It doesn't mean that Putin is going to reach for his briefcase and pull out big folders
10:06.900 - 10:11.820:  with all this technology and hand it all over to Kim, and that's not going to happen.
10:12.700 - 10:16.960:  But I think the message is, the signal is to the West, you know, I could do this if
10:16.960 - 10:19.620:  I so want to, so be careful.
10:20.320 - 10:25.640:  But of course, if Russia really, really does want an arms deal with North Korea, if it
10:25.640 - 10:31.460:  is desperate, and we don't know how desperate it is, to secure supplies of extra munitions
10:31.460 - 10:36.140:  from Pyongyang, then it's quite possible that Russia will hand something over, whether
10:36.140 - 10:40.680:  it's going to be help in launching a North Korean military satellite, we don't know.
10:41.100 - 10:45.920:  And as I say, we're unlikely to hear openly today from Russian officials what they've
10:45.920 - 10:46.180:  agreed.
10:46.760 - 10:51.520:  Steve Rosenberg, so then, can North Korea offer the munitions that Russia is looking for
10:51.520 - 10:53.600:  in exchange for military technology?
10:54.200 - 10:58.640:  The former British ambassador to North Korea John Everett says the partnership might struggle
10:58.640 - 10:59.440:  to take off.
10:59.820 - 11:04.100:  I think we have to recognize that there are real constraints on this relationship.
11:04.220 - 11:07.840:  What does North Korea give Russia other than munitions?
11:07.920 - 11:10.400:  Now Russia is desperate for munitions, certainly.
11:11.020 - 11:14.580:  But there are real quality problems with North Korean munitions.
11:15.020 - 11:16.340:  They have a high fail rate.
11:16.700 - 11:20.040:  The ones in storage have not been looked after properly.
11:20.060 - 11:23.120:  The fuses in the shells are not in a good condition.
11:23.120 - 11:27.340:  You have an awful lot of duds, which the Russians must surely know.
11:27.920 - 11:33.620:  And after they fired a few salvos of cells that simply failed to explode, how many more
11:33.620 - 11:36.500:  are they going to be prepared to buy from North Korea?
11:37.020 - 11:42.780:  The relationship isn't actually that well-founded, and I suspect that after a certain amount
11:42.780 - 11:47.380:  of razzmatas, it might run into the sound sooner than either leader would really like.
11:47.860 - 11:52.760:  Well, there's plenty more insight and analysis on the story on our website at bbc.com slash
11:52.800 - 11:53.340:  needs.
11:54.260 - 11:59.740:  New research suggests formal phrases in emails like to whom you may concern or your sincerely
11:59.780 - 12:02.280:  could become extinct in the next decade.
12:02.280 - 12:07.160:  This is New Generations, move away from the traditional letter writing style, and adopt
12:07.160 - 12:08.640:  a more personal tone.
12:09.180 - 12:10.000:  Harry Blire reports.
12:12.280 - 12:15.140:  Dear listener, I hope this email finds you well.
12:17.620 - 12:22.920:  Traditionally you start a workplace email with deer sir slash madame, or perhaps the
12:22.960 - 12:23.780:  person's title.
12:24.260 - 12:30.180:  Then for a sign off, there are the classic, best wishes, or kind regards, sometimes kindist
12:30.220 - 12:30.740:  regards.
12:31.320 - 12:36.160:  But why do we use this style of language, which we wouldn't do in normal speech?
12:36.460 - 12:41.140:  That kind of phrase is the sort of thing that we've adopted in place of the very formal
12:41.140 - 12:44.700:  yours faithfully, but also not just like, bye, see you soon.
12:44.940 - 12:49.920:  Laura Bailey is a senior lecturer in English language and linguistics at the University
12:49.920 - 12:50.580:  of Kent.
12:50.720 - 12:54.820:  So kind regards is specific to emails, it's clearly a sign off lots of people use that
12:54.820 - 12:58.980:  for their signature, but I've got to say some people use that for when they want to send
12:58.980 - 13:01.420:  an email that really conveys quite how annoyed they are.
13:01.700 - 13:06.560:  But this professional language is slowly disappearing, that's according to research commissioned
13:06.560 - 13:07.860:  by Barclay's bank.
13:08.500 - 13:14.820:  Now younger people especially are starting emails with high, hello, even hey, addressing
13:14.820 - 13:20.500:  recipients by their first name, not their title, and signing off with thanks or even tar.
13:21.340 - 13:26.320:  The study predicts that phrases like yours truly, yours sincerely and to whom it may
13:26.320 - 13:29.740:  concern may not be used at all in ten years' time.
13:30.580 - 13:35.360:  So why is this formal language being phased out, Laura Bailey again?
13:35.680 - 13:40.500:  I do think that it's probably to do with how we relate to each other on an interpersonal
13:40.500 - 13:40.920:  level.
13:41.260 - 13:46.060:  There's less of the strict hierarchy in workplaces these days, bosses often want to be
13:46.060 - 13:49.880:  seen as approachable and friendly, so you're much less likely to have to call your boss
13:49.880 - 13:55.340:  Mr. so and so, and we're consequently being more informal in our communications with
13:55.340 - 13:56.220:  each other as well.
13:56.420 - 14:01.560:  The survey found that many believed social media to be an influence too, as well as young
14:01.560 - 14:07.840:  people wanting to sound more personable, with 40% of Gen Z participants saying they felt
14:07.840 - 14:11.340:  it a struggle to demonstrate their personality through email.
14:11.700 - 14:13.000:  That report by Harry Bly.
14:15.260 - 14:15.840:  Still to come.
14:22.340 - 14:26.160:  The new look at the life story of rock legend, David Bowie.
14:31.320 - 14:36.760:  Unexpected elements is all about finding the surprising science angles to everyday news.
14:37.020 - 14:43.320:  I love that this show has the scope to discuss both emergent AI, new clearing Ghana and also
14:43.320 - 14:45.500:  what those stringy bits are on a banana.
14:45.520 - 14:50.740:  And joining the dots between their global connections, nature does pack a lot, surprises
14:51.000 - 14:51.180:  for us.
14:51.340 - 14:53.600:  And invisibility cloak in the acoustic domains.
14:53.600 - 14:54.200:  So cool.
14:54.340 - 14:57.420:  That's unexpected elements from the BBC World Service.
14:57.720 - 15:00.180:  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
15:02.740 - 15:06.540:  Now on the global news podcast, the death toll from last Friday's earthquake in Morocco
15:06.540 - 15:11.180:  has risen to around 3,000 as the authorities continue their efforts to reach remote areas
15:11.720 - 15:13.800:  of the Alice Mountains close to the epicenter.
15:14.040 - 15:15.680:  And it's not just the state providing aid.
15:16.060 - 15:19.860:  Large numbers of ordering Moroccans are buying food and supplies and heading into the mountains
15:19.860 - 15:22.440:  to give it to those who've been affected by the quake.
15:22.720 - 15:27.360:  The BBC's James Coppnell joined one group, setting off from the nearby city of Marrakesh.
15:32.440 - 15:36.560:  A gym in Morocco waits clattering to the floor, loud music on the stereo.
15:36.560 - 15:40.840:  And as you come towards the front of this building, well, it's been transformed in something
15:40.840 - 15:47.340:  of a makeshift storeroom, bottles of water, sanitary products, mattresses, even toys
15:47.340 - 15:48.080:  for children.
15:48.660 - 15:53.800:  A group of young Moroccans are using this gym as a base to transport products up to those
15:53.800 - 15:56.560:  affected villages in the mountains.
15:57.960 - 15:58.820:  I'm Amina Tb.
15:58.820 - 16:03.160:  Now we have these people who can afford to buy these things that are in desperate need
16:03.160 - 16:03.560:  for it.
16:03.920 - 16:08.180:  So we decided to get literally everything that they would need, that they require.
16:08.700 - 16:11.580:  And we had people giving donations from all around the country.
16:11.720 - 16:14.000:  And then we just go in and distribute in all of that.
16:14.620 - 16:17.460:  I mean, I'm a content creator and this is our gym actually.
16:17.820 - 16:19.280:  We've seen everyone is helping.
16:19.820 - 16:23.880:  No matter how, but we've seen people with one bike, with one half bag of sugar helping,
16:23.920 - 16:26.320:  we've seen people sending full trucks.
16:26.880 - 16:29.940:  And what we're witnessing is real unity.
16:30.140 - 16:34.700:  It's really good and filling our heart to know that we're Moroccan.
16:34.880 - 16:35.900:  That makes us really proud.
16:39.800 - 16:42.460:  We've been on the road for quite some time now.
16:42.460 - 16:45.300:  A convoy of ten or so vehicles.
16:46.360 - 16:52.300:  We've been heading out on a good tarmac road past historical castles and brand new farms.
16:52.960 - 16:54.860:  The landscape is pretty parched.
16:55.640 - 16:58.940:  But ahead of us, I can see the Atlas Mountains, that's our destination.
16:59.020 - 17:02.740:  Those villages that have been so badly affected by this earthquake.
17:06.580 - 17:09.080:  Well things haven't gone quite according to plan.
17:09.520 - 17:12.240:  In fact, it doesn't seem to have been that much of a plan.
17:12.240 - 17:14.540:  We've gone from one place to the other.
17:14.540 - 17:18.600:  We haven't yet found a village to hand out these provisions.
17:19.660 - 17:25.000:  We are on a very narrow mountain road in this little village and we're stuck.
17:25.140 - 17:28.420:  There are sort of traffic jam, vehicles coming in both directions.
17:29.680 - 17:32.500:  People are trying to help here, but it's all quite chaotic.
17:36.460 - 17:40.240:  We've ended up in a village high up on the hillside, called Agward Gour.
17:41.600 - 17:42.960:  No one here lost their life.
17:43.120 - 17:46.980:  Unfortunately, though, many have lost their homes down the hill.
17:47.020 - 17:49.620:  There were a couple of deaths in the nearby village.
17:50.520 - 17:54.820:  It's here that Amina and Amina and all their team are handing out some toys
17:54.980 - 17:57.360:  to look like some very, very exciting kids.
17:58.420 - 17:59.780:  Here it's well organised.
17:59.780 - 18:04.600:  As you can see, this person is in charge of giving the list of babies per age,
18:04.600 - 18:07.260:  so we can give them the good size.
18:08.060 - 18:09.440:  And this person, she's not from your group.
18:09.500 - 18:10.980:  She's someone you've found here in this village.
18:11.700 - 18:13.660:  She's in the village, actually. She's a volunteer.
18:14.500 - 18:17.300:  And this is quite a small village.
18:17.780 - 18:20.100:  Up in the mountains, it took us a while to get here.
18:20.500 - 18:22.940:  We're just trying to get to the most remote villages,
18:23.500 - 18:25.040:  because as you can see, when you go to main roads,
18:26.500 - 18:29.480:  there's a lot of military, a lot of tents.
18:30.360 - 18:33.220:  It's overwhelming. There's so many kids in this village
18:33.220 - 18:35.620:  and we're just distributing toys to them.
18:36.160 - 18:37.780:  That's all they care about. That's all they want.
18:37.780 - 18:41.000:  And it just makes us so happy to see smiles on their faces.
18:41.000 - 18:41.700:  It's amazing.
18:43.200 - 18:44.240:  You seem quite emotional, right?
18:44.500 - 18:45.180:  I am. I am.
18:45.980 - 18:46.160:  Why?
18:46.500 - 18:48.720:  I have two kids. They have everything.
18:48.860 - 18:50.860:  And then when you see kids like that who have nothing,
18:50.860 - 18:51.820:  it's just...
18:52.560 - 18:53.700:  It's really sad.
18:54.540 - 18:55.980:  It's really sad.
18:57.940 - 19:00.360:  Standing nearby, I found a resident, Eunice.
19:00.960 - 19:03.340:  I wondered how he felt about his fellow citizens
19:03.340 - 19:05.260:  bringing some help for his village.
19:06.080 - 19:07.240:  It's good. It's nice.
19:08.000 - 19:09.800:  This is Morocco. This is Morocco.
19:09.840 - 19:10.580:  This is Morocco.
19:11.120 - 19:11.960:  People helping each other.
19:12.120 - 19:13.220:  Yes, one people.
19:13.480 - 19:14.440:  That is one people.
19:15.220 - 19:16.800:  That report there by James Coppano.
19:17.760 - 19:20.780:  China has sentenced the former head of the nation's largest
19:20.780 - 19:22.860:  life insurer to life in prison
19:23.340 - 19:25.800:  as President Xi Jinping's crackdown on corruption
19:25.860 - 19:27.700:  in the financial industry continues.
19:28.300 - 19:31.300:  One being was chairman of China Life and found guilty
19:31.300 - 19:34.520:  of taking more than $45 million in bribes.
19:34.900 - 19:37.480:  The details from our Asia Business reporter, Nick Marsh.
19:37.940 - 19:40.860:  One being was actually technically sentenced to death.
19:41.420 - 19:45.580:  But it's suspended for two years after which he'll go to jail.
19:45.580 - 19:47.820:  He'll serve life, the court documents show
19:48.160 - 19:49.880:  that he'll be given no parole.
19:50.520 - 19:53.020:  In terms of what he's actually been found guilty of,
19:53.020 - 19:55.400:  as you said, these are corruption charges.
19:55.800 - 19:59.680:  And also he was concealing certain overseas securities
20:00.480 - 20:03.920:  and these payments were apparently for securing
20:03.920 - 20:06.580:  for friends and relatives, things like personal loans,
20:06.580 - 20:08.660:  green lighting, certain projects.
20:09.480 - 20:11.980:  And he was a member of the Communist Party
20:11.980 - 20:13.760:  like many before him.
20:13.760 - 20:16.940:  He's not the only top executive he's been found guilty
20:16.940 - 20:18.560:  of these corruption charges.
20:18.560 - 20:21.200:  There was the former chairman of the China Development Bank.
20:21.200 - 20:23.120:  He was sentenced to life in jail recently.
20:23.760 - 20:26.440:  Lice Yao Ming, who was a big asset management chief,
20:26.880 - 20:31.840:  was actually executed on corruption charges back in 2021.
20:32.460 - 20:35.400:  And I think it shows, firstly, President Xi Jinping,
20:35.400 - 20:39.800:  who made his name as a big anti-corruption guy early in his tenure.
20:40.420 - 20:44.720:  He really shows no intent on slowing down on this crackdown.
20:45.220 - 20:46.940:  And it also shows who's boss.
20:47.100 - 20:48.580:  It doesn't matter how much money you have,
20:48.580 - 20:50.500:  if you're in finance or whatever industry,
20:50.960 - 20:52.520:  ultimately you aren't into the party
20:53.080 - 20:54.120:  and there'll be the ones you decide.
20:54.720 - 20:55.620:  That was Nick Marsh.
20:56.380 - 20:58.440:  Now to Britain, where public debate is raging,
20:58.440 - 21:00.540:  after the home secretary, the Interior Minister,
21:01.100 - 21:02.980:  said the government was considering banning
21:02.980 - 21:06.480:  the Excel bully, a dog breed weighing over 50 kilos,
21:07.080 - 21:10.100:  which is a muscular mix of people and staff at Sheteria.
21:10.600 - 21:11.940:  It comes after one of them attacked
21:11.960 - 21:14.160:  and a living-year-old girl in Birmingham over the weekend.
21:14.160 - 21:16.360:  The Excel bully, which originates from America,
21:16.360 - 21:19.820:  is already illegal in France, Turkey and the UAE.
21:20.160 - 21:23.700:  And it's claimed to have killed 10 people in the UK last year.
21:24.200 - 21:26.040:  So just how dangerous is the breed?
21:26.040 - 21:27.640:  The UK Veterinary Surgeon Amy Stamp
21:27.640 - 21:29.660:  spoke to the BBC's Justin Webb.
21:30.000 - 21:32.160:  These are really big powerful dogs,
21:32.160 - 21:33.520:  often upward to 50 kilos.
21:34.180 - 21:37.840:  And if they're in a situation where they feel threatened
21:38.400 - 21:41.120:  and they're presenting aggressive tendencies,
21:41.760 - 21:43.460:  then the damage from a dog of that size
21:43.460 - 21:47.140:  is going to be far worse than the damage caused by a smaller breed.
21:47.340 - 21:49.180:  How is it for you and other events
21:49.480 - 21:50.700:  to dealing with them? How difficult?
21:51.420 - 21:53.480:  It can be really, really challenging for us
21:53.520 - 21:55.140:  to do the job that we want to do.
21:55.140 - 21:58.720:  And it ultimately begins to affect these dogs
21:58.720 - 22:00.500:  and they're well aware as well.
22:00.700 - 22:03.320:  So for reasons such as the only may not present them
22:03.360 - 22:04.360:  to the practice anyway,
22:04.640 - 22:06.360:  if they know they're going to struggle to handle them
22:06.360 - 22:06.860:  when they're there.
22:07.480 - 22:09.480:  But sometimes we'll see them for a medical problem,
22:09.540 - 22:11.040:  but we're unable to examine them.
22:11.660 - 22:13.120:  Why do people have them?
22:13.340 - 22:15.360:  I mean, the people who, presumably,
22:15.360 - 22:17.380:  if you're bringing a dog like this into a vet,
22:17.380 - 22:18.340:  you care about it.
22:18.460 - 22:21.400:  It's costing you fair bit of money to deal with.
22:21.620 - 22:24.920:  When you talk to them about wider issues of pet ownership,
22:24.920 - 22:25.760:  what do they say?
22:26.400 - 22:28.100:  When we're seeing large breeds like this,
22:28.560 - 22:31.360:  then quite often they are seen as a state assemble.
22:32.060 - 22:33.420:  You know, they are dogs that are bred
22:33.520 - 22:36.280:  to be intimidating to look at.
22:36.800 - 22:38.500:  But I will say this is not all exel bullies.
22:38.500 - 22:40.500:  And there are very many of them
22:41.060 - 22:42.440:  that are really lovely sweet dogs.
22:43.040 - 22:44.520:  And that's interesting because I mean,
22:45.440 - 22:46.520:  I had thought that they were bred
22:47.620 - 22:48.500:  that they were simply in their nature
22:49.220 - 22:50.520:  to be hugely aggressive in certain situations.
22:51.700 - 22:52.500:  Are you saying some aren't?
22:53.360 - 22:54.500:  This is definitely not all exel bullies.
22:54.500 - 22:56.520:  And like with any dog breed,
22:56.520 - 22:58.500:  there are inherent traits in that.
22:58.660 - 23:01.340:  You'll always see a collie wanting to herd.
23:01.760 - 23:03.520:  Even if they're not trained to do that.
23:04.820 - 23:07.500:  So yes, there will be a tendency that maybe they will climb that,
23:07.540 - 23:09.380:  what we call the ladder of aggression.
23:09.460 - 23:10.660:  They will climb that a lot quicker.
23:11.140 - 23:13.220:  But the responsibility lies with the owners
23:13.900 - 23:16.300:  to be able to train these dogs
23:16.400 - 23:18.220:  to manage those traits appropriately.
23:18.520 - 23:18.700:  Yeah.
23:18.880 - 23:20.500:  Meanwhile for vets around the country,
23:20.520 - 23:21.740:  not just in your practice,
23:22.160 - 23:24.220:  this must be tricky sometimes to do with them.
23:24.220 - 23:26.480:  And you wonder if it might even put some people off
23:27.220 - 23:28.440:  becoming vets in the first place.
23:28.900 - 23:30.020:  It definitely can be scary.
23:30.200 - 23:31.080:  When you're seeing a dog of this,
23:31.120 - 23:32.800:  I was like, say the roughwoods are 50 kilos.
23:33.440 - 23:35.620:  Like any, any large dog like that.
23:36.180 - 23:38.340:  Then if you're faced in a situation
23:38.460 - 23:39.540:  where they're opposite you.
23:39.860 - 23:42.200:  And especially if you're not 100% sure
23:42.200 - 23:44.480:  of how the owner is handling their dog,
23:44.480 - 23:45.980:  if they're going to inexperience owner.
23:45.980 - 23:47.460:  And then it's the rest of his disaster.
23:48.060 - 23:49.340:  Would you ban them, Amy?
23:50.760 - 23:53.120:  I think banning the breed is not the answer here.
23:53.120 - 23:54.500:  It's not going to solve the problem.
23:54.760 - 23:57.380:  There's huge inherent risks with that
23:57.380 - 24:00.140:  because they're not recognized as a breed.
24:00.180 - 24:01.060:  They're a crossbreed.
24:01.060 - 24:03.680:  And they're a really wide variety of Excel bullies.
24:04.040 - 24:06.580:  So you'd then be banning a breed based on how it looks.
24:07.080 - 24:08.680:  The Veterinary Surgeon, Amy Stamp.
24:09.360 - 24:10.940:  We're in this podcast with David Bowie,
24:10.940 - 24:12.800:  who during his lifetime spoke to the BBC
24:12.800 - 24:14.420:  more than any other broadcaster.
24:14.900 - 24:16.880:  And now a new book brings together dozens
24:16.880 - 24:19.400:  of those interviews from BBC TV and Radio,
24:19.900 - 24:22.080:  including one which is now thought to have been his last.
24:22.080 - 24:25.480:  The transcripts effectively tell his life story in his own words
24:25.640 - 24:27.440:  and are being compiled by the BBC journalist
24:27.580 - 24:29.260:  and Bowie expert Tom Higgler.
24:31.560 - 24:33.300:  A 17-year-old, David Jones,
24:33.400 - 24:36.480:  has just founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
24:36.520 - 24:37.980:  to long-haired men.
24:38.220 - 24:40.360:  Now exactly who's being cruel to you?
24:40.800 - 24:42.360:  Well, I think we're all fairly tolerant.
24:42.660 - 24:43.480:  But for the last two years,
24:43.480 - 24:45.320:  we've had comments like darling
24:45.320 - 24:47.500:  and can I carry a handbag thrown at us?
24:48.280 - 24:49.480:  I don't think it's just had to stop now.
24:50.020 - 24:52.400:  David's first appearance on the BBC was back in 1964.
24:52.400 - 24:55.480:  And he was there as the founder of the Society
24:55.540 - 24:59.320:  to prevent cruelty to long-haired gentlemen.
24:59.320 - 25:03.020:  Now this sounds like a spoof and clearly a publicity stunt.
25:03.160 - 25:06.500:  But there's also an element of seriousness to this
25:06.500 - 25:09.480:  because Bowie had long hair at the time as did his friends.
25:09.500 - 25:11.340:  They couldn't get served in bars.
25:11.640 - 25:14.180:  And just walking down the street, this person came up to
25:14.180 - 25:17.460:  and he said, and then this big Herbert just punched me
25:17.620 - 25:18.800:  and knocked me to the ground.
25:19.240 - 25:21.480:  Then you go forward almost 10 years
25:21.480 - 25:24.360:  and he appears on top of the pops with Starman.
25:24.720 - 25:26.440:  And if you like, that's the moment
25:26.440 - 25:29.520:  that Bowie is introduced as Ziggy starred us to the nation.
25:30.280 - 25:32.280:  17 to 20 million people are looking at him.
25:32.600 - 25:36.440:  And suddenly, here is this extra terrestrial landing on
25:36.440 - 25:39.480:  terrestrial TV and parents are not going,
25:40.020 - 25:42.400:  who is that? But what is that?
25:51.280 - 25:53.480:  One funny and interesting interview, I think,
25:53.480 - 25:57.480:  is one he did with Valerie Singleton in the late 70s.
25:58.060 - 26:01.060:  It's almost slightly disdainful of him.
26:01.400 - 26:03.920:  What about all those incredible periods when you wall
26:03.920 - 26:06.600:  as outrageous feminine clears in the makeup?
26:06.600 - 26:10.120:  Well, they were. I mean, I thought David Bowie
26:10.120 - 26:11.600:  and I immediately associated with that.
26:12.260 - 26:13.640:  Did that carry over into real life?
26:13.860 - 26:16.420:  I only used to wear that kind of stuff when I was about 17
26:16.420 - 26:20.380:  or 18. By the time I reached the ribot 8 of 2021,
26:21.160 - 26:23.540:  I'd gotten into high heels, shoes and things.
26:24.160 - 26:26.760:  They came about through Japanese theatre and modernity.
26:27.420 - 26:30.700:  I tried to put together kabuki and pantomime.
26:30.960 - 26:33.040:  We always saw his last interview on Radio.
26:33.040 - 26:36.060:  Anyway, at least was with Mark Riley just before his half-sack.
26:36.060 - 26:40.900:  But it came across his interview from 2005 with Courtney Pine on Radio 2.
26:41.140 - 26:43.200:  Great to have you on this show, David. Now you're keeping, man.
26:43.300 - 26:44.760:  Thanks very much for asking Courtney.
26:44.760 - 26:48.020:  Yeah, I'm doing fine. I've been working out a lot this last year
26:48.200 - 26:49.840:  and I'm back on course, I think.
26:50.340 - 26:53.060:  Good. It's the only interview that David Bowie gave
26:53.780 - 26:56.080:  after his half-sack, about 14 months afterwards.
26:56.380 - 26:59.180:  This is David Bowie and I'd like to introduce this wonderful track,
26:59.460 - 27:03.480:  Hot Calling Blues from the album Oh Yeah by Charlie Mingus.
27:05.000 - 27:06.920:  This is the second book I've written on him.
27:07.240 - 27:09.040:  So it's always fascinating to hear him
27:09.040 - 27:12.440:  because he's one of the most interesting voices in rock music.
27:12.440 - 27:16.380:  I can only really think of John Lennon being his equal in terms of
27:16.380 - 27:19.400:  just humor and breadth of knowledge and intelligence.
27:19.400 - 27:23.480:  And what really struck me is just how courageous he was
27:23.480 - 27:27.520:  that he performed through a heart attack on stage to the audience,
27:28.220 - 27:30.020:  not once, but twice.
27:30.680 - 27:36.480:  And that is a whole different level of bravery to what was a very brave career.
27:36.480 - 27:39.480:  I mean, here's somebody who was openly bisexual.
27:39.480 - 27:42.440:  He wore dresses. He shaved his eyebrows.
27:42.440 - 27:45.480:  He looked like an alien at the time when you said you were gay.
27:45.480 - 27:46.960:  You could be beaten up on the streets.
27:46.960 - 27:48.280:  It was an awful lot of homophobia.
27:48.880 - 27:54.400:  And yet this is, I think, just a new level, a new type of courageousness.
27:54.500 - 28:01.200:  I said that time they changed me, but I can't trace that.
28:15.460 - 28:18.680:  The music there of David Barry and that report by Tom Hakeler.
28:21.380 - 28:23.480:  That's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of
