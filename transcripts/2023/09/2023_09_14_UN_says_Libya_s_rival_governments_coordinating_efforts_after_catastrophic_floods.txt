01:05.840 - 01:09.160:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:10.480 - 01:16.060:  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Thursday, the 14th of September, these are our main stories.
01:16.740 - 01:21.880:  The UN says the two rival governments in Libya are liaising as they try to deal with the aftermath
01:21.880 - 01:27.300:  of catastrophic floods. US police have recaptured a convicted murderer
01:27.580 - 01:32.420:  who's escaped from prison in Pennsylvania two weeks ago sparked a huge manhunt.
01:33.120 - 01:36.680:  Three relatives of a ten-year-old girl found dead at her home in Britain
01:37.080 - 01:39.580:  have been arrested on their return from Pakistan.
01:42.420 - 01:43.300:  Also in this podcast?
01:44.300 - 01:49.360:  You're probably with that blonde girl who always made me
01:49.660 - 01:53.740:  Pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo announces a world tour.
01:57.560 - 02:01.960:  We begin in Libya where the full extent of the devastation of the port city of Dürner
02:01.960 - 02:06.800:  is becoming clearer. Four days after a storm caused widespread flooding.
02:07.380 - 02:12.060:  More than 5,000 people are known to have died and thousands more are missing
02:12.060 - 02:16.080:  after entire neighbourhoods disappeared under tsunami like
02:16.240 - 02:19.780:  torrents of water unleashed by the bursting of two dams.
02:20.480 - 02:25.700:  Many have been buried in mass graves even as bodies continue to be recovered from the sea
02:26.060 - 02:31.040:  and rescue teams search through the rubble of collapsed buildings hoping to find survivors.
02:31.860 - 02:36.500:  Johar Ali is a Libyan journalist in Istanbul whose family are in Dürner.
02:36.960 - 02:40.280:  My friend I'm staying with him right now to support him
02:41.080 - 02:48.880:  because I heard the news of the death of his full family, his mother, his father,
02:48.900 - 02:57.760:  his two brothers, his sister, and his newly married wife which he sent to Libya
02:57.760 - 03:05.640:  to visit his family just two weeks ago and his little kid whose eight months old
03:06.500 - 03:09.860:  all of those died. All of his family is dead.
03:10.200 - 03:14.720:  Some Libyans have voiced frustration at the country's political divisions have hampered
03:14.720 - 03:21.360:  eight efforts. Libya is divided between two rival governments, one operating in the capital
03:21.360 - 03:27.500:  triply and another in the east. But now the UN says the two rival administrations are coordinating
03:27.500 - 03:32.380:  their relief efforts. The UN's high commissioner for human rights is Volkerturk.
03:32.780 - 03:39.960:  I call on all Libyan political actors to overcome dead logs and divisions and to act collectively
03:40.580 - 03:46.580:  in ensuring access to relief. This is a time for unity of purpose. All those affected must
03:46.580 - 03:52.060:  receive support without regard for any affiliations. It is important that particular carries
03:52.060 - 03:58.240:  taken to ensure protection of groups in vulnerable situations who are rendered even more at risk
03:58.240 - 04:03.520:  in the aftermath of such a disaster. Human rights need to be at the centre of the response to
04:03.520 - 04:09.960:  this heartbreaking situation. Our reporter, Quentin Somerville, is monitoring the situation from Beirut.
04:13.880 - 04:19.060:  Rapt in the thick blanket a child's body is gently removed by rescue workers from the muddy
04:19.060 - 04:24.120:  rubble and dirt. A distraught relative looks on. They will help me, God willing,
04:24.120 - 04:30.100:  he wails, as the small corpse is placed in a black body bag and the bodies keep coming.
04:30.100 - 04:36.180:  On the edge of the port city, heavy machinery digs mass graves. Entire buildings were swept out
04:36.180 - 04:43.080:  to sea after two mountain dams failed unleashing a deluge upon Derna. Bodies are being washed ashore
04:43.480 - 04:49.860:  by the dozen. The jeep Taruni is a doctor working in Benghazi 180 miles away at the nearest large
04:49.860 - 04:55.140:  hospital to Derna, where casualties will eventually be sent. I've never seen something like this in my
04:55.140 - 05:00.180:  life and I've lived through two civil wars. I've lived through a revolution where people have died,
05:00.180 - 05:04.300:  left and right. I've seen people die all over the place. I've worked in the hospital. I see people
05:04.300 - 05:11.940:  die from the armed conflicts. This is overwhelming, losing more than 10,000 people in one day,
05:11.940 - 05:15.940:  people that you knew, people that you work with. And I'm still under a shock of the
05:15.940 - 05:22.220:  situation right now. Derna has long been marginalized. It was once a stronghold of the Islamic state group
05:22.220 - 05:28.000:  and Eastern Libya is controlled by a government that few countries recognize. The self-styled
05:28.000 - 05:34.500:  Libyan National Army holds power there. It spokesman Ahmed Al-Masmari denied responsibility for
05:34.500 - 05:40.860:  the disaster. It has been an enormous shock and I do not want to point the blame at anyone,
05:40.860 - 05:46.900:  or create controversy. Even if all measures had been taken, there would have been losses, massive
05:46.900 - 05:54.940:  losses. The powerful storm which hit Libya's coast was unusually strong, but locals like Abu Al-Montazah
05:55.160 - 06:01.320:  said that the people of the city have long been neglected. We have warned the authorities for weeks,
06:01.780 - 06:07.520:  no, for years, that the dam had crutches and needed to be maintained. We said it and nobody
06:07.520 - 06:13.200:  listened to us. And now the whole of Derna is flooded. International aid has begun arriving at
06:13.200 - 06:18.600:  Benghazi airport, but with many of the roads in the region washed away, it will take time to reach
06:18.600 - 06:26.600:  Derna. Quentin Somerville will tragic eyewitness accounts from Libya keep emerging. Tahar Muftar is a
06:26.600 - 06:32.680:  photojournalist living in Derna. He was working on the day of the floods by a terrible sound. That
06:32.680 - 06:38.780:  of the first dam near the city collapsing. He survived mainly because he lives on higher ground.
06:38.860 - 06:41.760:  He told my colleague Rebecca Kesby what he saw.
06:44.480 - 06:51.900:  First of all, it was just some water that went up all around. Before this dam collapsed,
06:51.940 - 06:59.140:  when the dam collapsed, around 2.30 in the night, we started to hear something like an air strike.
06:59.140 - 07:06.520:  It was something like a heavy machinery, a heavy guns, and it was a horrible sound. There was
07:06.520 - 07:14.700:  a complete collapse of building after that and there was a lot of people who actually were asleep
07:14.700 - 07:21.500:  on their houses. So this building's collapsing actually led to a lot of people died inside their
07:21.500 - 07:28.180:  houses. When you looked out from where you were on the the safer higher ground and you first saw
07:28.180 - 07:35.560:  this water, this deluge coming down the valley towards the city. With your own eyes,
07:35.560 - 07:41.220:  what was going through your mind at that point? What did it look like and how did you feel watching
07:41.220 - 07:49.820:  that? I left the house around 6 in the morning. I wasn't expecting what I'm going to see. When I
07:49.820 - 07:58.840:  arrived to the dam, all the buildings were completely collapsed. The bridges connecting the valley,
07:58.940 - 08:05.900:  the east of the city to the west were all collapsed. People had to take more time to go to the other
08:05.900 - 08:12.520:  side to search for other people or to get something. The water now has stopped and what is left
08:12.940 - 08:18.540:  is only the rebels and the people who were taken by the flood under the water.
08:18.880 - 08:22.220:  What's happened to the rest of the city? What does it look like?
08:24.760 - 08:31.640:  The situation was disastrous. What I saw on the other side of the city was a lot of houses
08:31.640 - 08:40.040:  collapsing, like three floors, four floors, all down to the ground. That was Taha Muftar, a photo
08:40.040 - 08:46.500:  journalist living in the Libyan city of Derna. The UN envoy to Sudan is stepping down,
08:46.580 - 08:53.280:  Volker Pertis announced his resignation to the UN Security Council in New York. He said the conflict
08:53.280 - 08:59.140:  that erupted between rival military factions in April risked becoming a full-blown civil war.
08:59.140 - 09:05.460:  Will Ross reports. In a final speech to the Security Council, the UN special envoy to Sudan was
09:05.460 - 09:10.660:  extremely critical of the country's military ruler, General Albert Han and the RSF Chief General
09:10.660 - 09:16.120:  Hermetti. Volker Pertis said they chose to plunge the country into a war that's leaving a tragic
09:16.120 - 09:20.480:  legacy of human rights abuses. He blamed the RSF for the sexual violence,
09:20.480 - 09:25.780:  looting and killings, and he condemned the Sudanese armed forces for indiscriminate aerial bombings.
09:26.140 - 09:30.820:  As he was speaking, medics in the city of Niala in Darfur were dealing with the aftermath of yet
09:30.820 - 09:36.700:  another atrocity. 40 people died there in airstrikes, adding to the more than 50 who were killed in
09:36.700 - 09:43.080:  Khartoum on Sunday. Will Ross, US police have recaptured a convicted Brazilian murderer who
09:43.080 - 09:47.380:  spent two weeks on the run after escaping from a county jail in the state of Pennsylvania.
09:48.220 - 09:54.300:  The manhunt for Danilo Calvacente involved more than 500 police officers. He was jailed
09:54.300 - 09:59.700:  for life in August by US court for murdering his ex-girlfriend in front of her two children.
09:59.700 - 10:05.160:  The state governor, Josh Shapiro, expressed gratitude that he'd been apprehended peacefully.
10:06.000 - 10:13.560:  Shortly after 8am, our suspect was captured. I want to say, first and foremost,
10:14.680 - 10:21.000:  thank God there were no injuries to law enforcement or to the public. We obviously became deeply
10:21.000 - 10:28.180:  concerned after the suspect was able to steal a weapon. He was apprehended this morning
10:28.960 - 10:30.840:  with no shots fired.
10:58.180 - 11:04.680:  He's gone up into an alleyway, two wolves. He's used his legs in his arms. He shuffled up
11:04.680 - 11:10.080:  crab style, escaped and scaled a raid to wire fence at the top. But what's perhaps even more
11:10.080 - 11:15.400:  shocking than that naked gun film trilogy style of escape? Because he's not the first to do it.
11:15.400 - 11:20.180:  Somebody else did it last May. And people were very worried because he was breaking into homes
11:20.180 - 11:25.700:  after he broke out. He managed to steal a rifle. So there must be huge relief now that this
11:25.700 - 11:31.000:  prisoner has been recaptured. You'd imagine so. Journalists speaking to local gun shop owners
11:31.340 - 11:36.080:  have heard that apparently there was a massive uptake in people buying firearms. People were
11:36.080 - 11:40.540:  very concerned about him breaking into houses because that's what he was doing to eat food on his
11:40.540 - 11:47.120:  13-day sojourn away from the prison there in Chester County. They'd sent in a search team
11:47.120 - 11:52.020:  under heavy rain and thunder at four o'clock in the morning because of drugs enforcement
11:52.020 - 11:56.660:  agency playing that was lending a hand had picked up his heat signature. They say they
11:56.660 - 12:01.320:  moved in quietly. That's quite impressive. If anybody's come across any form of police canine
12:01.820 - 12:05.580:  around the world, you know the one thing that they tend to do. They tend to be general purpose
12:05.580 - 12:10.660:  dogs often. They'll bark. They'll make noises and bitten as it turns out during his arrest.
12:11.240 - 12:18.000:  And so when he was captured, the drama continued. Round 20 to 30 police officers dressed in camouflage
12:18.000 - 12:23.660:  holding heavy guns, dressed very much more soldiers than police officers, standing around with him
12:23.660 - 12:29.860:  in the middle of grave look on his face, wearing for a time a grey hoodie handcuffed behind his
12:30.280 - 12:36.980:  back as they posed to say, yeah, Pennsylvania state troopers got their man assisted by federal
12:36.980 - 12:43.380:  and local law enforcement from around the USA. Sean Dilly British politics has been rocked by
12:43.380 - 12:48.960:  allegations of Chinese espionage in the past few days. It's emerged that a parliamentary researcher
12:48.960 - 12:53.740:  with links to senior members of the governing conservative party was arrested for spying
12:54.320 - 12:59.900:  back in March. He says he's innocent, but many politicians on both sides of the aisle are
12:59.900 - 13:04.640:  questioning why the government has been recently trying to improve ties with Beijing.
13:05.620 - 13:11.240:  So how are informants recruited for espionage by China? In a separate case, Gawain Towler,
13:11.240 - 13:16.320:  who previously worked for the UKIP party, which campaigned to leave the EU, says he believes he
13:16.320 - 13:21.600:  was approached to be a spy after being contacted by a man on LinkedIn who offered him work.
13:22.180 - 13:26.840:  He was representing a few Chinese firms based in Hong Kong and Beijing. And we chatted,
13:26.840 - 13:32.580:  who do I know? And at that point, I was very well known and quite well respected figure in Whitehall,
13:32.580 - 13:38.080:  at least in the pubs of Whitehall. I knew the lobby, I knew many of the junior ministers and ministers.
13:38.680 - 13:43.580:  It wasn't silly to talk to me. And they were talking, this was all online, this was all via LinkedIn.
13:43.940 - 13:47.820:  This is all via LinkedIn. And we had a couple of chats, sort of telephonic chats.
13:48.300 - 13:52.180:  We got to a point and he'd asked me to give them a list of the sort of people I knew and I was
13:52.180 - 13:55.520:  able to do that and go to small pen portraits, some of the figures, all this is above board.
13:56.080 - 14:00.280:  And he said, well, why don't you come over to Hong Kong for a few days and we'll introduce you
14:00.280 - 14:04.700:  to these companies and we'll have that as a final interview. So what happened when you flew out?
14:05.040 - 14:09.600:  So I landed in Hong Kong very late at night and I had this greeting committee of two, Kevin,
14:09.600 - 14:15.920:  who was the English name of the fellow I've been talking to. And a young woman, maybe in the early
14:15.920 - 14:21.920:  20s, they were there at this five-star hotel that put me up in. And we sat in through to the round
14:21.920 - 14:28.780:  about 1-1-30. He said, meet you at 7-30 after breakfast, so I met. And we went off and we talked
14:28.780 - 14:34.000:  about the things that people I knew and the systems I knew and what I was interested in and so on.
14:35.020 - 14:39.560:  I was there for three and a half days, so that was the first day. Lunchtime and dinner was
14:39.560 - 14:44.400:  Michelin style restaurants. What sort of things were they asking you? Initially they were entirely
14:44.840 - 14:49.320:  in keeping with the sort of public affairs lobbying, the sort of people I've talked to,
14:49.800 - 14:53.120:  involvement I'd had in Brussels in the European Parliament and the sort of people I knew there.
14:53.120 - 14:58.660:  I'd sort of be asked to go away and come up with a short proposal on how to develop a strategy
14:58.660 - 15:04.180:  on selling a particular business idea. Who did they say that they represented?
15:04.180 - 15:07.940:  By the end of day one, I did start saying, and am I going to meet any of these companies?
15:08.460 - 15:13.200:  It got more and more intense the next day. By midday the second day, I'm now in Hong Kong
15:13.200 - 15:18.560:  in a hotel being questioned in a cheaper hotel room, being taken out of these restaurants, and
15:18.780 - 15:23.820:  I'm stuck on time. There's nothing I can do. It's becoming clear that they're not going to introduce
15:23.820 - 15:29.140:  me to companies. By day three, we were moved to a different hotel. All telephones were taken out of
15:29.300 - 15:35.320:  the room, and this figure that they introduced as President Xi's chief European advisor arrived.
15:35.320 - 15:40.320:  Now he clearly spoke English, but everything was done through translation. At this point,
15:40.320 - 15:45.520:  they started talking about what they really wanted, was documents before publication.
15:45.900 - 15:51.720:  On China's interests, Britain's response to the Belt and Road program, Britain's response to
15:52.120 - 15:56.320:  this Chinese state rather than Chinese companies. What was the pay? What sort of pay were they
15:56.320 - 16:01.660:  talking about? For the simple stuff, pen portraits sort of briefing documents on individuals,
16:01.660 - 16:07.380:  five to 700 pounds for a two-page document. Now, the weirdest thing in some ways was this phone
16:07.380 - 16:12.160:  they gave me. They they aware that I do Instagram, I like photography, and the idea was like,
16:12.160 - 16:17.780:  take a photograph of a document, upload that into a photograph of my own in the app on this phone,
16:18.180 - 16:22.200:  post that onto Instagram. They could download the photograph from Instagram on the other side
16:22.200 - 16:27.340:  of the world, and then download out of the photograph this document, which was all a bit bond.
16:27.380 - 16:33.480:  I was given this phone. Basically, that was the end of the three days, as I left, checked out of
16:33.480 - 16:38.640:  the hotel, and then sort of gingerly went to the airport, never turning that phone on, came home,
16:38.640 - 16:43.180:  told somebody I knew who was associated with the security services, and left it at that.
16:43.660 - 16:46.560:  Goaine Towler speaking to my colleague Sarah Montague.
16:49.420 - 16:55.460:  So to come, he saw a bullet on the top of the back seat, right back where you would have come out
16:55.460 - 17:01.840:  of Kennedy's back. A new revelation from a former US Secret Service agent about the assassination of
17:02.040 - 17:02.780:  John F. Kennedy.
17:08.300 - 17:13.400:  Unexpected elements is all about finding the surprising science angles to every day
17:13.400 - 17:19.600:  news. I love that this show has the scope to discuss both emergent AI, new clearing Ghana,
17:19.600 - 17:24.740:  and also what those stringy bits are on a banana. And joining the dots between their global
17:24.740 - 17:30.540:  connections, they show does pack a lot surprises for us. An invisibility cloak in the acoustic domain.
17:30.540 - 17:36.500:  So cool, that's unexpected elements from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get your BBC
17:36.500 - 17:43.060:  podcasts. Welcome back to the global news podcast. The death of a 10-year-old girl in the UK last
17:43.060 - 17:49.500:  month has been dominating headlines here in Britain and also in Pakistan. Because the child's
17:49.640 - 17:56.100:  father, stepmother and uncle flew out to Pakistan just before her body was discovered in the south
17:56.100 - 18:01.620:  of England. They took five other children with them. Post mortem test showed that the little girl
18:01.620 - 18:07.900:  had sustained multiple and extensive injuries. British police have been wanting to speak to the
18:07.900 - 18:14.620:  three adults and they have now returned voluntarily to the UK from Pakistan. My colleague Rebecca
18:14.620 - 18:18.580:  Kesby heard more from our Islamabad correspondent Caroline Davies.
18:19.360 - 18:24.320:  Well, we have just received a statement from the Surrey police. Now this was the police force that
18:24.320 - 18:29.160:  said that they had wanted to speak to these three individuals and they have now confirmed that
18:29.160 - 18:34.040:  these three individuals and their words they've described two men aged 41 years old and 28
18:34.040 - 18:40.240:  and a woman aged 29 were arrested on suspicion of murder after disembarking from a flight from
18:40.240 - 18:46.820:  Dubai. They say they are now in custody and will be interviewed in due course that Sarah Sharif's
18:46.880 - 18:52.220:  mother has been informed of this latest update and is being supported by specialist officers.
18:52.840 - 18:58.640:  They've also said this is an extremely fast-moving, challenging and complex inquiry and will remain
18:58.640 - 19:04.740:  absolutely committed to conducting a thorough investigation into Sarah's death. So this new
19:04.740 - 19:10.100:  update now from Surrey police having had these three individuals that have now landed back
19:10.220 - 19:15.100:  in the country. Yes and Caroline I know you've been following this since the little girl was
19:15.100 - 19:21.420:  discovered and there was a huge police hunt on for these three people in Pakistan wasn't there
19:21.420 - 19:27.220:  but it does seem they they boarded the plane voluntarily. Do we know why? Yes, so this has been
19:27.220 - 19:33.100:  ongoing for weeks with the Pakistan authorities trying to locate these three individuals.
19:33.680 - 19:37.800:  In terms of exactly why they decided to board the flight at this point we don't know for definite
19:37.800 - 19:44.100:  we were told by police in Pakistan that before they boarded the flight they hadn't been arrested
19:44.840 - 19:50.220:  but a little bit of the backdrop to the story, the herf and Sharif and Benish were told
19:50.620 - 19:54.980:  that Sarah Sharif's father and her stepmother had actually released a video
19:55.520 - 20:00.780:  about less than a week ago where they said in it they talked about the pressure that had been put
20:00.780 - 20:06.440:  on their family they said by the police they accused the Pakistan police of harassing their
20:06.440 - 20:11.640:  family that could have played a role but also in the course of the last few days the five children
20:11.640 - 20:18.180:  that traveled out with them initially to Pakistan were found at their grandfather's house in the
20:18.180 - 20:24.300:  family home in Jellum and they were then taken by police and ultimately they were given to a
20:24.300 - 20:30.200:  Pakistan government run care home, now a child's care home and at the moment that is a temporary
20:30.200 - 20:35.540:  measure but it could well be that learning of that has also made them change their mind but
20:35.540 - 20:40.160:  ultimately we don't know for certain what has meant they've decided to come back to the UK.
20:40.920 - 20:46.220:  Caroline Davies in Islamabad. France has ordered Apple to stop selling the iPhone 12 for
20:46.220 - 20:52.360:  emitting too much electromagnetic radiation. French regulators also ordered the tech giant to
20:52.360 - 20:59.180:  fix the models which have already been sold. The iPhone 12 came out in 2020 so why has it taken
20:59.180 - 21:05.640:  French officials three years to detect high levels of radiation? A question my colleague Ed Butler
21:05.640 - 21:10.680:  put to the technology journalist Kate Bevan. Well your guess is as good as mine it's also worth
21:10.680 - 21:16.040:  noting actually that Apple says its own measurements of the radiation of the electromagnetic emissions
21:16.980 - 21:22.860:  don't breach the regulation so that's up against the the French body on this and we'll be
21:22.860 - 21:28.640:  inching to see how that one pans out because I tend you know Apple will spend an absolute fortune
21:28.640 - 21:34.040:  on this kind of testing and be very keen to make sure all its devices are compliant. I mean that
21:34.040 - 21:39.600:  said you know if the French testing organization says it's over and it's not compliant then it's
21:39.600 - 21:44.000:  not compliant but you know there's a mismatch between what Apple says and what France has.
21:44.180 - 21:49.840:  What are the French telling Apple it has to do then? Apple is being threatened with having to
21:49.840 - 21:56.320:  recall every iPhone 12 ever sold in France which would be quite the undertaking. I mean it would
21:56.740 - 22:01.240:  wouldn't it and you kind of think that the entire nation would sort of stop communicating I know
22:01.240 - 22:05.880:  there are other phones are available but do you not mean it's going to be a large subset of people's
22:06.240 - 22:10.680:  mobile telephony isn't it? Yes it is and they're not necessarily going to have another phone to use
22:10.680 - 22:14.800:  in the interim while that if and when their phones are recalled. I mean to be honest I'd be
22:14.800 - 22:19.500:  astonished if they get as far as actually recalling it but you know there is a standoff going on
22:19.500 - 22:23.600:  and it's a serious standoff. I mean I think it's also worth pointing out though that the World Health
22:23.600 - 22:29.300:  Organization points out that there is no evidence of harm at all from the day minimise levels
22:29.300 - 22:33.620:  of electromagnetic radiation you get from the mobile phones. It's all a bit theoretical anyway.
22:34.320 - 22:39.660:  Kate Bevan some of the biggest names in tech such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg attended a
22:39.660 - 22:44.160:  meeting at the US Congress on Wednesday to share their plans for artificial intelligence
22:44.160 - 22:50.160:  as the US prepares to drop legislation to better control the technology. Senator Chuck Schumer,
22:50.160 - 22:55.240:  the Democratic majority leader of the US Senate, is holding a series of closed door meetings
22:55.240 - 23:03.300:  where lawmakers can quiz tech leaders about things like chat GPT which took the world by storm
23:03.300 - 23:09.360:  since its release last year. From Washington here's Nomea Iqbal. I'm actually outside the meeting
23:09.360 - 23:15.180:  room and we've been seeing that sort of a who of tech tycoons enter and all hundred senators are
23:15.180 - 23:21.080:  in session as well but you mentioned there that keyword here closed room which means that it's close
23:21.080 - 23:26.280:  to the public and the media. We were briefly allowed inside the room before the forum began to
23:26.280 - 23:31.540:  view the setup. I should say that the meeting is bipartisan but so is the criticism because members
23:31.540 - 23:36.380:  of the Democratic Party and Republican Party are saying well what is the end result here?
23:36.820 - 23:41.740:  I mean what they're all really doing is getting together to work out should there be some regulation
23:41.880 - 23:48.160:  on AI? Elon Musk when he left earlier he said that the consequences of it going wrong are severe.
23:48.160 - 23:53.420:  We have to be proactive rather than reactive and he did say the question is one of civilizational
23:53.420 - 23:58.820:  risk just to add senators weren't given an opportunity to directly ask questions of the tech
23:58.940 - 24:04.660:  execs. They were instructed to submit written questions which is something that's also annoyed a
24:04.660 - 24:09.400:  lot of the lawmakers but the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is very positive about it. He
24:09.400 - 24:14.380:  came out a short while ago saying that it was a good start to the sorts of conversations that need
24:14.380 - 24:23.200:  to be had. Nomea Iqbal in Washington now let's take you back to 1963. From Dallas, Texas the flash
24:23.200 - 24:29.900:  apparently official president Kennedy died at 1 p.m. central standard time.
24:30.880 - 24:36.540:  The American news presenter Walter Cronkite announcing the assassination of President John F. Kennedy
24:36.540 - 24:42.320:  in Dallas. You'd think that after 60 years and countless books and articles there wouldn't be
24:42.320 - 24:48.140:  anything left to come out about what happened. Well a new detail does seem to have emerged. Paul
24:48.140 - 24:53.880:  Landis, a former secret service agent who witnessed the assassination at close hand, says in an
24:53.880 - 24:59.500:  upcoming memoir that he took a bullet from the presidential car and left it on the president's
24:59.520 - 25:05.000:  stretcher at the hospital. And that has sparked the interest of some of the people who refused to
25:05.000 - 25:11.740:  accept the official version of events. That President Kennedy was shot dead by a lone government
25:11.860 - 25:18.940:  Lee Harvey Oswald. My colleague James Menendez has been speaking to James Robert Nalt, a historian
25:18.940 - 25:24.500:  and Kennedy expert who's been collaborating with Mr. Landis and we must warn you that some people
25:24.500 - 25:30.100:  may find the following distressing. First of all the book was done before I got it. I got it
25:30.260 - 25:35.760:  from the publisher to do a blurb and when I read it I thought oh my goodness what Landis says is
25:35.760 - 25:40.540:  that when they got to Parkland Hospital Jackie Kennedy was credoing you know the president
25:40.540 - 25:48.800:  in her lap and would not let go she finally did and when she stood up to walk in he saw a bullet
25:48.800 - 25:54.660:  on the top of the back seat right back where you would have come out of Kennedy's back with the
25:54.660 - 26:02.780:  final shot that violently pushed him back against the the seat itself. And so what that shows is that
26:02.780 - 26:10.120:  the so-called single bullet theory is no longer viable. That theory was the Warren commission's theory
26:10.180 - 26:15.620:  that one of the bullets went through Kennedy. Transit it is necked and went into governor Connelly
26:15.620 - 26:20.980:  and caused all his injuries. He ended up in this very pristine condition on Connelly's
26:20.980 - 26:26.980:  stretcher in Parkland. Why does this under why does it undermine that? Well it does because
26:27.660 - 26:34.280:  if the first shot hit shallow in Kennedy's back and then dropped out the next shot that hits Connelly
26:34.280 - 26:39.640:  you can see it on this a brutal film is a second later. That's not enough time for Lee Harvey Oswald
26:39.640 - 26:45.720:  to have cocked and loaded and aimed his rifle to shoot the second shot. It takes him about 2.3 seconds
26:45.720 - 26:50.980:  or more to do that. So there's just not enough time between when the first shot hit Kennedy
26:51.480 - 26:56.180:  and then the second shot to hit Connelly and if that's true you had to have two shooters to do that.
26:56.180 - 27:01.100:  Right which is which is quite a big deal if that's the case. I mean there are those who say
27:01.100 - 27:05.540:  it isn't true. I think Clint Hill the agent who jumped up on the back of the Kennedy car people
27:05.540 - 27:10.220:  might remember that from the images say you know he doesn't believe him and also you know why
27:10.220 - 27:15.640:  he remembered this now so many years after. It's a complicated question but it really boils down
27:15.640 - 27:20.740:  to the fact that during the first week after the assassination Paul was working his protectee
27:20.740 - 27:25.500:  was Jackie Kennedy and he sat with her outside the trauma room. He then went you know on Air Force
27:25.500 - 27:31.760:  1 back to Washington and sat at Bethesda Medical Naval Hospital where the autopsy was being done with
27:32.240 - 27:38.260:  her and Bobby Kennedy all night and then for the rest of that week was on duty. He had no time to
27:38.260 - 27:44.900:  grapple with the fact that he was experiencing severe PTSD. He saw the head shot. He saw the
27:44.900 - 27:50.400:  president's head explode. He literally had to duck so that he wouldn't get hit by splatter and
27:51.020 - 27:55.460:  that was looping in his head. So the last thing he was thinking about he thought he left the boat
27:55.460 - 28:01.740:  with the body for the autopsy didn't think about it you know let it go and then he became Jackie's
28:01.920 - 28:07.240:  Secret Service agent for the next six months and she would not sit down. She was traveling everywhere.
28:07.300 - 28:13.300:  He was exhausted and he finally quit after six months. When he quit he had expected the Warren
28:13.300 - 28:19.440:  Commission to interview him. They never interviewed him and so he went on his way and then for the next
28:19.440 - 28:25.740:  40 years just avoided everything until he read something in 2014. So I was just going to say now
28:25.740 - 28:30.240:  I'm expected the Warren Commission to interview him. I mean if he did why didn't he just volunteer
28:30.240 - 28:35.760:  his testimony? Well because you know as far as he was concerned if they wanted to talk to him they
28:35.760 - 28:41.680:  could talk to him but he really was avoiding anything to do with this because it was just so
28:41.680 - 28:46.500:  painful. He was really experiencing he couldn't sleep at night. It was something that he was trying
28:46.500 - 28:52.020:  to get over. He tried to power through it for the next six months couldn't do it and he just he
28:52.020 - 28:58.280:  left and you know he still expected them to call him but by the time he left they hadn't even issued
28:58.280 - 29:03.300:  their report so nobody even knew that the bullet was an issue at all. It wasn't there was no single
29:03.300 - 29:08.900:  bullet theory any of that sort of stuff. Anyone you left he turned it off. Historian and Kennedy
29:08.900 - 29:15.900:  expert James Robynolt. Two years on from her spectacular debut album the pop star Olivia Rodrigo's
29:15.900 - 29:22.400:  second one is on course to top the US in UK charts and the 20-year-old has announced a world tour
29:22.400 - 29:27.240:  to support it. She was a Disney teen actor before becoming a global music phenomenon
29:27.240 - 29:34.540:  selling 18 million copies of her first album sour and winning three Grammys. Her coming-of-age song
29:34.540 - 29:39.960:  spoke of heartbreak and social anxiety and resonated strongly with an audience stuck in lockdown.
29:40.540 - 29:46.180:  Her follow-up album Guts released on Friday marks a change as she explained to her music correspondent
29:46.180 - 29:55.980:  Mark Savage. Two years ago Olivia Rodrigo achieved the sort of overnight success that isn't supposed
29:55.980 - 30:13.500:  to be possible in the modern fractured music industry. Her debut single driver's license broke
30:13.500 - 30:19.040:  Spotify's records for the most streams in a single day. Twenty four hours later it beat that
30:19.040 - 30:23.380:  number again. It was really encouraging and made me feel less lonely in the world.
30:25.760 - 30:30.960:  At that point she'd never played a concert but by the end of last year she'd staged a world tour,
30:30.960 - 30:37.560:  scored a number one album and won three Grammy Awards. She says it's all been a bit of a blur.
30:38.120 - 30:43.540:  It was absurd and so quick and you know I'd been writing songs and working my whole life but
30:43.660 - 30:49.940:  it did seem sort of instantaneous and it wasn't until very recently that I sort of began to process
30:50.920 - 30:56.800:  just how crazy it all was and how irrevocably my life sort of was changed in a span of a few months.
30:56.800 - 31:02.420:  You wrote the first album with such freedom away from the spotlight. How do you secure that freedom
31:02.420 - 31:07.840:  when you're writing after the success of sour? Yeah I mean it's really hard. I think I struggled with it
31:08.320 - 31:11.320:  towards the beginning of writing the album. I just remember I'd sit down and write at the piano
31:11.320 - 31:15.940:  and I would write the lyrics and the only thing I think about is like people on Twitter like dissecting
31:15.940 - 31:20.740:  the lyrics or making it about this one thing or you know whatever and that was hard and that's
31:20.740 - 31:26.700:  obviously the antithesis of creativity is thinking in that mindset. So I had to shift my mindset
31:26.700 - 31:29.980:  like about halfway through making the record and to just trying to make songs that I would like
31:29.980 - 31:34.780:  to hear on the radio and the second that I did that it just started becoming so much more fun
31:34.780 - 31:40.100:  than it felt like creative again. On the opening song of her new album she sarcastically
31:40.100 - 31:43.100:  lamppoons the impossible standards imposed on women.
31:53.000 - 31:59.180:  Women are so discouraged from showing emotions like anger or dissatisfaction for fear of being
31:59.220 - 32:04.360:  ungrateful or complaining or you know hard to be around. I've always struggled with that and I
32:04.360 - 32:09.820:  think because I've always felt that pressure to be this like perfect all-American girl I guess I
32:09.820 - 32:14.960:  kind of repressed a lot of feelings in my life and I think that came up and hurt me in different
32:14.960 - 32:19.760:  ways and so I've always thought about that sort of push and pull between the two sides of the feminine
32:20.200 - 32:25.040:  psyche. It's not the first time she's used music to address the issues that concern her.
32:25.480 - 32:32.380:  The Supreme Court decided to overturn Roe v Wade which is a law that ensures a woman's right
32:32.380 - 32:38.540:  to a safe abortion. On stage at Glastonbury last year she spoke emotionally about the threats to
32:38.540 - 32:46.060:  abortion access in the US. That is stated and terrified and so many women and so many girls are
32:46.060 - 32:50.760:  going to die because of this. Is that kind of political activism something you want to get involved
32:50.760 - 32:57.520:  with more? Yeah totally I think as a songwriter all that I do all day every day is kind of express
32:57.520 - 33:02.600:  how I feel and so I think it would be a real shame if I didn't express how I felt about other things
33:12.020 - 33:16.260:  that I feel strongly about. The honesty of her songwriting is the key to her popularity with the
33:16.260 - 33:23.160:  new album Guts currently outselling the rest of the top 10 combined. Our music correspondent Mark
33:23.160 - 33:28.880:  Savage talking to singer, songwriter and women's rights activist Olivia Rodrigo.
