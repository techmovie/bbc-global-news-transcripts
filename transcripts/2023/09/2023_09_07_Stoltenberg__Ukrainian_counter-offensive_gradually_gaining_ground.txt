00:18.460 - 00:21.720:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Friday,
00:21.720 - 00:27.920:  the 8th of November. The head of NATO says Ukraine is taking back land from the Russian invaders,
00:27.920 - 00:34.700:  but more slowly than hoped. No one ever said that this is going to be easy, but the Ukrainians
00:34.700 - 00:41.800:  are making progress. Some hundred meters per day. More than 60 civilians and soldiers are reported
00:41.800 - 00:46.760:  to have been killed in an attack by Islamist militants on a military camp in Northeastern Marley.
00:47.340 - 00:51.880:  One of Donald Trump's former aids, Peter Navarro, is found guilty of contempt of Congress
00:52.380 - 00:55.560:  for refusing to answer questions about the storming of the US Capitol.
00:57.580 - 01:01.940:  Also, in the podcast, new data reveals the volcanic explosion in Tonga last year,
01:01.940 - 01:07.540:  produced the fastest underwater debris flows ever detected. And...
01:07.860 - 01:12.660:  Add Sotheby's for the baby grand. Final warning. Sold to you. Thank you very, very much indeed.
01:14.500 - 01:17.680:  Freddie Mercury's Piano sells an auction for $2 million.
01:23.260 - 01:26.860:  Ukraine's much heralded counteroffensive is now into its fourth month,
01:26.860 - 01:30.820:  but the Ukrainians haven't been able to match the success of last year,
01:31.240 - 01:35.440:  when they pushed the Russian invaders back from Kiev, Harkiv, and Herzogn.
01:35.440 - 01:41.280:  The slow pace of the current advances led to speculation that Ukraine's allies may get impatient
01:41.280 - 01:46.660:  and cut off the flow of military supplies. But speaking at the European Parliament on Thursday,
01:46.660 - 01:53.060:  the NATO boss Jens Stoltenberg said support would continue whether Ukraine was winning or losing.
01:53.700 - 01:58.880:  No one ever said that this was going to be easy, but the Ukrainians decided to launch
01:58.880 - 02:03.960:  offensive because they are going to liberate the land. And they are making progress,
02:04.920 - 02:10.420:  not perhaps as much as we hoped for, but they are gaining ground gradually.
02:11.000 - 02:15.680:  Some hundred meters per day, meaning that when the Ukrainians are gaining ground,
02:15.700 - 02:20.400:  their Russians are losing ground. The Ukrainian forces say they've broken through the first
02:20.400 - 02:26.600:  and strongest line of Russian defence in the southern Zaparizhya region, but they are still a long
02:26.600 - 02:31.760:  way from their presumed objective of reaching the coast and thus cutting Russian forces into.
02:32.620 - 02:36.580:  For an assessment of how they're doing, I spoke to Defence Analyst Jonathan Markus.
02:37.480 - 02:42.700:  I think the important thing to look at is not so much the movement of lines on the ground.
02:42.700 - 02:47.980:  It's the damage that both sides are doing to each other's forces and to their equipment.
02:47.980 - 02:52.320:  And whether Ukraine now can cause sufficient damage to the Russian forces,
02:52.320 - 02:57.800:  opposite them to be able to deepen and widen this breakthrough. It has been slow.
02:57.800 - 03:02.660:  They've taken on an extraordinary task. They are trying to attack heavily fortified positions.
03:02.720 - 03:07.420:  The Russians had months to prepare these. They're at least three lines of defence they have to
03:07.420 - 03:12.780:  get through. And they are attacking the strongest area of those defences without many of the
03:12.900 - 03:16.720:  key bits of equipment that an equivalent Western army would have. And frankly,
03:16.720 - 03:21.100:  most Western armies would have trouble as well. But progress is being made. And I think as
03:21.100 - 03:25.540:  somebody once said about going bankrupt, first they went bankrupt slowly and then very quickly.
03:25.540 - 03:30.420:  Well, you might say if the Ukrainians are to succeed, they may be succeeding slowly now.
03:30.540 - 03:34.840:  Their hope is that they will then achieve some sort of tipping point and they will be able
03:34.840 - 03:39.060:  to make a larger breakthrough more quickly. There are occasional reports of Russia making
03:39.060 - 03:44.000:  small advances of its own. And then there's also reports that it may be preparing for a big
03:44.000 - 03:48.400:  counter-offensive in the North. How do you think things will play out in the next few months?
03:49.000 - 03:52.800:  Well, the Russians clearly are mounting an offensive in the North. These are the front if you
03:52.800 - 03:57.780:  want to call it that. I think most experts wonder quite what the strategic aim there is other than
03:57.780 - 04:04.340:  perhaps to draw off Ukrainian forces and to compel Kiev to put reserves into that sector rather than
04:04.340 - 04:10.860:  their drive southwards towards the sea. As to a much larger Russian offensive being prepared,
04:10.860 - 04:15.760:  it's very hard to know where those forces or the equipment or the ammunition would come from.
04:15.780 - 04:20.380:  I can't rule it out, but I think at the moment it looks as though the Russians are pretty heavily
04:20.380 - 04:25.920:  committed. Jens Stoltenberg mentioned the huge Russian minefields that they've planted
04:25.920 - 04:31.180:  slowing down the Ukrainians. Does that mean that any advances are going to be slow or could
04:31.180 - 04:37.520:  different weapons such as the F-16s help the Ukrainians move faster? No, obviously F-16s
04:37.520 - 04:41.200:  would be great, but you have to have fully trained pilots capable of integrating them with
04:41.200 - 04:46.000:  Ukraine's air defenses and so on. That will take time. I think the thing is that there isn't a
04:46.000 - 04:51.460:  wonder weapon. The key thing is not so much weapon systems. It's the capacity of sticking power,
04:51.720 - 04:57.880:  morale, having the ammunition and the reserve forces to keep up this pace of operation,
04:57.960 - 05:01.840:  and that's the real battle between the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's on the
05:01.840 - 05:06.000:  resolution of that equation. The immediate future of this war will rest.
05:06.000 - 05:12.440:  Jonathan Marcus, defense analyst from Exeter University. The military authorities in Marley say
05:12.440 - 05:18.220:  at least 64 people have been killed in an attack by Islamist militants on an army camp in the
05:18.220 - 05:22.800:  Gal region in the northeast of the country. Most of the victims are believed to have been
05:22.800 - 05:27.720:  civilians, with the details here's Julian Bedford. There's been growing pressure on the military
05:27.720 - 05:33.720:  in Marley to act since one of the country's best known cities, Timbuktu, came under an Islamist
05:33.720 - 05:39.140:  blockade late last month. They've subsequently carried out a string of air raids on Jihadist
05:39.140 - 05:44.120:  targets, but have failed to drive back the rebels who've seemed to have drawn confidence from
05:44.120 - 05:51.040:  the junta's expulsion of French and UN peacekeepers. The UN has two bases close to Timbuktu,
05:51.640 - 05:56.040:  and are in the process of handing them over to the Marleyan army and their new allies
05:56.040 - 06:02.460:  varg the mercenaries from Russia. This latest attack only confirms that the Islamists are able
06:02.460 - 06:08.520:  to strike at will at the military infrastructure and the hundreds of civilians who shelter within.
06:08.620 - 06:15.200:  Julian Bedford reporting. Another one of Donald Trump's former advisors is facing jail time in
06:15.200 - 06:21.100:  the latest fallout from the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Peter Navarro,
06:21.100 - 06:25.900:  who advised President Trump on trade and also served on the COVID-19 Task Force,
06:25.900 - 06:31.580:  was found guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the US House of Representatives
06:31.580 - 06:36.920:  Committee that was investigating the attack. The court rejected Mr. Navarro's argument that he
06:36.920 - 06:43.040:  was covered by Donald Trump's executive privilege. Speaking outside court, Mr. Navarro said he would
06:43.040 - 06:51.400:  appeal. This is the first time in the history of our republic that a senior White House advisor
06:51.520 - 06:55.920:  and alter ego of the president has ever been charged with the alleged crime.
06:56.560 - 07:02.660:  Another Trump ally, Steve Bannon, was also found guilty of contempt of Congress but is currently
07:02.660 - 07:09.160:  out of jail pending appeal. Mr. Navarro could face up to a year in prison when he sentenced in
07:09.160 - 07:14.300:  January. I heard more about the case from our correspondent in Washington, Gary O'Donohue,
07:14.760 - 07:19.740:  starting with why the Congressional Committee had subpoenaed Mr. Navarro in the first place.
07:20.480 - 07:24.120:  They wanted to ask him about something called the green base sweep, which for
07:24.120 - 07:29.000:  officials of American football is a sort of tactic for an end run, but it was his phrase for
07:29.180 - 07:34.420:  their plan to overturn the election results in Congress on January the 6th when the riots happened.
07:35.080 - 07:39.020:  And he's boasted about, he's written about it and he's memoir and it was about rejecting those
07:39.020 - 07:43.960:  electoral votes from the six states that Joe Biden won that they wanted to claw back and going
07:43.960 - 07:47.720:  through a long process like that. So they wanted to interview him about that and get documents
07:47.720 - 07:52.700:  about that. He refused, he claimed he was protected by executive privilege, which actually Donald
07:52.700 - 07:57.940:  Trump has never claimed for that process. And that defense was thrown out, so it was a really
07:57.940 - 08:03.100:  short trial, Ollie. Last two days, the jury route for about five or six hours deliberating,
08:03.100 - 08:07.380:  he offered no evidence in his defense and he could be looking at jail term.
08:07.620 - 08:12.740:  Yeah, I mean, he was defiant outside court and he suggests it could go all the way to the supreme
08:12.740 - 08:17.720:  court. So is this a constitutional matter? He's hoping it is and that's why they will appeal
08:17.880 - 08:22.440:  and it'll have to go through the appeal court circuit in DC and then possibly you could be given
08:22.440 - 08:27.400:  leave to appeal further up than that. But this defense of executive privilege, he couldn't run it
08:27.400 - 08:32.060:  because Donald Trump had never claimed executive privilege over that material. So it's a bit
08:32.060 - 08:37.000:  of a difficult one for him. And of course, it won't do him any favors, I think, in the appeal court
08:37.040 - 08:41.180:  that he didn't offer any kind of other defense. I mean, literally his lawyers said nothing,
08:41.180 - 08:45.920:  apart from cross-examining some of the prosecution witnesses. So we'll see what the grounds for appeal
08:45.920 - 08:51.400:  are as things stand. He's not going to prison anytime soon, as we've seen from Steve Bannon,
08:51.460 - 08:56.480:  he's still outpending his appeal and I suspect he'll be treated the same. He's in Navarro,
08:56.620 - 09:00.380:  was there throughout the whole administration. Steve Bannon, you know, was there for seven months,
09:00.380 - 09:04.700:  but Peter Navarro was there throughout. So another one of the president's men, Holly.
09:04.900 - 09:10.600:  Gary Adonihoo in Washington. The Indian authorities have come in for criticism over some of their
09:10.600 - 09:16.900:  efforts to spruce up the capital deli ahead of the G20 meeting this weekend. India wants to use the
09:16.900 - 09:22.000:  summit to highlight its role on the world stage, but conservationists have accused the Indian
09:22.000 - 09:27.220:  archaeological department of vandalism. After footage showed decorative writing on a muggle
09:27.220 - 09:33.000:  era mosque had been plastered over. And as our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein reports,
09:33.580 - 09:38.740:  some marginalized communities in deli have also accused the government of moving them out.
09:41.160 - 09:46.060:  India's capital city has been getting a makeover. Streets are being cleaned, decorative statues
09:46.060 - 09:51.940:  have been erected and G20 posters, many with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's face on billboards.
09:52.860 - 10:01.200:  As world leaders arrive, this is India's moment. To the world, India is promoting itself as a leader,
10:01.660 - 10:09.720:  making the G20 manner to Indians. I am Mehagakaran, I'm from Delhi. G20 means a lot to me as an Indian
10:09.720 - 10:15.300:  and it is the biggest achievement I feel for the government. Hi, I'm Somya. We are the one
10:15.300 - 10:21.400:  hosting it. That sense of collectiveness is what India is about and yes I'm very excited for it.
10:22.520 - 10:26.980:  A new convention center has been built for the occasion and just a few hundred feet away
10:26.980 - 10:33.680:  are walls made of green corrugated steel put up just before the G20, hiding behind the walls
10:34.040 - 10:42.160:  is an India visiting world leaders will not see. Small concrete homes alongside open sewage
10:42.380 - 10:47.620:  narrow alleyways, impoverished communities are not being cleaned up like the rest of the city.
10:47.620 - 10:54.740:  Instead they are being kept from sight. Saddam has lived here all his life. He says
10:54.740 - 11:01.660:  being hidden makes him angry. To me it looks very beautiful. They have transformed
11:01.660 - 11:08.000:  Delhi but in making it beautiful it seems we are stains like craters on the moon. They have made
11:08.000 - 11:13.900:  us stain. We can fight. They have hidden us. So they might as well remove us from here.
11:16.060 - 11:22.900:  I'm walking through an area that looks like nothing but dirt. I see broken bricks, I see rocks,
11:22.900 - 11:28.860:  broken pieces of concrete, someone's shoe. It seems like it just tossed away remnants of people's
11:28.960 - 11:33.860:  lives. Well that's because just two months ago people were living here. There were people's
11:33.860 - 11:39.500:  homes and even a community school but it was all demolished. It's now been raised to the ground
11:39.500 - 11:46.460:  and turned into nothing. Government says the homes were illegal. The G20 just happens to be
11:46.460 - 11:52.560:  taking place across the street. But it's not what Maya was told when her home was destroyed.
11:54.960 - 12:00.220:  They broke her homes and made us homeless. They said they wanted to clean up the area for the G20.
12:00.220 - 12:07.300:  They said move from here. They removed us all. Maya ending that report from Delhi by Samira
12:07.300 - 12:13.040:  has seen. In the past few weeks thousands of Haitians have been displaced from their homes by
12:13.040 - 12:18.800:  rampaging gangs in the capital Porto Pras. With no functioning governments and an under-resourced
12:18.800 - 12:23.820:  police force it seems there is nothing to stop the violence escalating in the Caribbean nation.
12:24.240 - 12:28.960:  The BBC spoke to one woman who described what happened to her last month when she was at home
12:28.960 - 12:35.840:  with her toddlers. The gang members forced me to flee. They'd invaded our neighbourhood and they
12:35.840 - 12:40.320:  threw a molot of cocktail into our house. I grabbed my two youngest children who were with me at the
12:40.320 - 12:45.320:  house and we jumped over the wall to get away and there was a man behind us and he got hit by a
12:45.320 - 12:50.540:  bullet. Luckily for us we weren't hit by any bullets and we were able to get away. The fighting
12:50.540 - 12:56.000:  had initially started on November the 10th. By the time it got to August 13th police officers
12:56.000 - 13:01.220:  in our neighbourhood who were trying to control the gangs couldn't do so any longer. They were
13:01.220 - 13:06.820:  running out of bullets and had to give up. We ran to a nearby TV station. The station opened up
13:06.820 - 13:13.380:  the gym for all of his refugees. At the gym I ran into some of our neighbours and they asked me if
13:13.380 - 13:18.580:  I'd heard news about my family. I told them no and they told me to sit down and have some water
13:18.760 - 13:23.640:  because they had some sad news for me. That's when they told me that my mother's house was burnt down
13:23.640 - 13:29.280:  and that my family members had most likely died in the house. My mother, my stepfather,
13:29.640 - 13:35.480:  my 18-year-old son, my brother, my sister and two family friends who lived with them. There
13:35.480 - 13:41.060:  is nothing that can replace the scar that's on my heart. I just want to have news from my family
13:41.060 - 13:46.620:  members. We're living like animals but actually there are some animals that are better off than us.
13:47.500 - 13:52.860:  I'm alive but it's as if I'm not really living. One woman's account of the terror brought
13:52.860 - 13:59.980:  by Haiti's gangs. My colleague Tim Frank spoke to Dave Fisameh who returned from the U.S.
13:59.980 - 14:05.860:  to be a youth worker in Porto Pras. The last time we heard from him in January he said the situation
14:05.860 - 14:11.780:  was terrible. He told Tim what things are like now and warning you may find parts of this interview
14:11.780 - 14:18.740:  distressing. I've compared this gang phenomenon with a body that has cancer and no accident
14:18.740 - 14:24.700:  taken to remedy that illness and else spread to other parts of the body until the person with
14:24.700 - 14:29.600:  the illness dies and that's pretty much what Haiti's dealing with right now. Each day, each week,
14:29.600 - 14:34.240:  each month it goes by. This is which and your skin's worse and worse. We have neighborhood
14:34.240 - 14:40.180:  brigades who have to check your vehicle to make sure that you're not airing guns or other items
14:40.180 - 14:46.140:  to help the gangs and their fight on many occasions I've gone through these barricades and you've
14:46.140 - 14:51.820:  found bodies burning and these folks were killed in machetes and their bodies were being burnt
14:51.820 - 14:56.740:  and these barricades. So that's a common sight that I'm also familiar right now and
14:57.020 - 15:01.640:  is anybody at the moment talking about the possibility that some sort of
15:01.640 - 15:07.380:  international force might come in and help the authorities try to regain order?
15:07.720 - 15:12.300:  Well that's something that's been discussed in the media and within different international
15:12.300 - 15:19.060:  bodies like Caracom and the U.N. but nothing's come out to fruition so far and with the way
15:19.060 - 15:23.760:  things are right now, I firmly believe that the only way is with some international military
15:23.760 - 15:28.940:  support and if we wait until it's too late for that support to come, maybe thousands for folks
15:28.980 - 15:35.000:  who will be killed by the gangs. Dave, I'm a talking to Tim Franks from Porto Press in Haiti.
15:35.540 - 15:40.980:  For many years, there's been an implicit bargain in China. The communist authorities will ensure
15:40.980 - 15:45.420:  the nation's prosperity and in return the people won't challenge the party line.
15:45.500 - 15:51.280:  But even as the Chinese economy falters, rules governing people's lives in China are becoming
15:51.280 - 15:57.880:  increasingly strict. The latest proposed law would ban outfits that are, quote, detrimental to
15:57.880 - 16:03.960:  the spirit of Chinese people and hurt Chinese feelings. I heard more from our Asia-Pacific regional
16:03.960 - 16:10.080:  editor, Celia Hatton. The idea is that anyone who's found wearing such clothing is liable for
16:10.080 - 16:19.180:  15 days in detention or a fine of about $700. Really what's key here is the language being used
16:19.180 - 16:24.300:  in this law. Hearding the feelings of the Chinese people, this is a catchphrase that everyone in
16:24.300 - 16:30.940:  China knows. It dates back to 1959 actually and it's been used increasingly often usually when
16:30.940 - 16:35.320:  China wants to criticize something that another country's doing that it doesn't like. So
16:35.320 - 16:40.900:  the United States or Japan are the prime targets of the hurting the feelings of the Chinese people
16:40.900 - 16:46.060:  catchphrase. What's interesting is that this phrase is being applied to Chinese people themselves
16:46.060 - 16:51.020:  and that's where it's quite interesting. Taking action against people for what they wear
16:51.020 - 16:56.300:  does seem quite extraordinary. Yeah, that's right. Some people have already been detained for
16:56.300 - 17:02.040:  wearing clothing that the police don't like. Last year in the Chinese city of Suzhou, a woman who
17:02.040 - 17:09.180:  was wearing a kimono Japanese traditional dress was detained by police. We don't really know what
17:09.180 - 17:14.180:  happened in that case, but because she was wearing clothing associated with Japan and there's long
17:14.180 - 17:19.520:  intentions between China and Japan, that was seen as something that the police were unhappy with.
17:19.660 - 17:25.360:  And just last month, people who were attending a concert given by a Taiwanese pop star,
17:25.360 - 17:30.460:  anybody who was wearing clothing with a rainbow symbol on it, maybe associated with the LGBT
17:30.460 - 17:35.500:  community, they were told to turn their shirts inside out so this rainbow clothing couldn't
17:35.500 - 17:39.760:  be visible. Frankly, Chinese police have a lot of power already, so I don't think this law
17:40.100 - 17:45.640:  really changes that much. It just kind of makes things sort of more explicit in a way. It's warning
17:45.640 - 17:50.280:  to people not to wear certain clothing, but it's also quite vague. You don't know exactly what
17:50.280 - 17:55.200:  clothing is being banned. And that's really for the authorities where the magic lies in this law.
17:55.500 - 17:59.960:  Are they just being able to feel that they can really crack down on people and really kind of
17:59.960 - 18:04.720:  force upon this idea of a model citizen? Or are they operating from a position of weakness?
18:04.720 - 18:09.520:  They're worried about their crumbling economy, and they want to use this as a warning to anybody
18:09.520 - 18:14.540:  who might start thinking about airing grievances as a way to crack down on them even more.
18:14.860 - 18:20.940:  I age a Pacific editor, Celia Hutton, and still to come on the Global News podcast.
18:21.800 - 18:24.000:  One player going to die, and they're going to see her.
18:24.640 - 18:29.180:  The Russian tennis star, Daniel Medvedev, complains about the heat at the US open,
18:29.760 - 18:30.620:  so what can be done?
18:38.780 - 18:43.740:  People in Lebanon have finally been able to see the Barbie film after weeks of controversy.
18:43.740 - 18:47.960:  The release was delayed as the Culture Minister tried to get it banned for quote,
18:47.960 - 18:52.340:  promoting homosexuality, insulting men, and degrading mothers.
18:52.960 - 18:58.420:  Lebanon once prided itself on its cultural openness, but the controversy over Barbie has highlighted
18:58.420 - 19:03.120:  what some say is a growing intolerance by officials of the LGBT community.
19:03.800 - 19:08.960:  Andrew Peach spoke to Justin Shilat at the Free Expression Think Tank, Penn America.
19:09.520 - 19:13.180:  The direct quote from the Culture Minister, Mohamed Wartata,
19:13.180 - 19:17.880:  is that contradict faith and morality and promoted homosexuality.
19:17.960 - 19:21.480:  That was in the government's words why they were trying to ban the film in the first place.
19:21.720 - 19:29.180:  More broadly speaking, I think that the ban before is overturned was indicative of a crackdown
19:29.180 - 19:36.440:  on the LGBT community in Lebanon, but also on dissident and any sort of non-conformity
19:36.620 - 19:38.340:  or marginalized communities overall.
19:38.520 - 19:41.660:  I haven't seen the Barbie film. My teenage daughter has been deceived.
19:42.300 - 19:48.060:  And like many people, her reaction to this was, I don't quite see what the theme is in the movie
19:48.080 - 19:51.980:  that is supposed to be promoting an LGBT lifestyle in the first place.
19:51.980 - 19:54.360:  It's hardly under the overriding theme of the thing.
19:54.640 - 19:56.920:  It's on its face a very stupid decision and yet
19:56.920 - 19:58.620:  diabolically clever at the same time.
19:58.840 - 20:01.540:  The knee jerk reaction of a lot of people is going to be,
20:01.800 - 20:05.020:  okay, you have banned this film about, as I understand it,
20:05.020 - 20:08.640:  plastic toys come to life and living out their lives in this fantasy world.
20:09.100 - 20:11.780:  Why is this worth the government's time to tension the energy?
20:11.940 - 20:17.580:  Then you think about it more broadly in the context of this crackdown and dissent
20:17.740 - 20:18.860:  and it starts to make sense.
20:19.240 - 20:23.320:  So this ban against the Barbie film in Lebanon was first proposed earlier in August.
20:23.660 - 20:28.420:  During that same month, we have seen violent attacks against bars and bayroot hosting
20:28.420 - 20:33.980:  drag shows, stand-up comedians hauled before military interrogators for jokes that they have told.
20:33.980 - 20:37.840:  In some cases, years previously, interrogations against journalists,
20:37.840 - 20:44.460:  we have seen really a pretty broad sweeping crackdown against anyone who might question the
20:44.460 - 20:49.320:  government or against anyone who might belong to a vulnerable or marginalized community.
20:49.820 - 20:51.600:  Just in Shailad, talking to Andrew Peach,
20:52.320 - 20:56.860:  should elite sports stars be expected to compete in extreme weather conditions?
20:56.940 - 21:02.840:  Temperatures at the US Open tennis tournament in New York hit 35 degrees Celsius on Wednesday
21:02.840 - 21:07.860:  and the Russian player Daniel Medvedev said the heat and humidity was putting players
21:07.860 - 21:11.520:  lives at risk during his quarter-final victory over Andrej Rublev.
21:12.120 - 21:15.000:  The BBC's David Law was commentating on the match.
21:36.520 - 21:41.680:  BBC commentary team, but what are the effects of extreme temperatures on sports people?
21:41.680 - 21:47.180:  Mike Tipton is a professor of human physiology from cramps to exhaustion,
21:47.560 - 21:51.900:  and it's not just physical impacts that end up with heat stroke, which is a major medical
21:52.100 - 21:56.900:  emergency. It also affects decision-making, which is where you start to see people making bad
21:56.900 - 22:01.820:  decisions, dizziness, lightheadedness, and that's despite all the mitigations that are in place,
22:01.820 - 22:06.180:  so you get to the point where we're going to just see more and more of this because of climate change.
22:06.780 - 22:10.640:  For more on the impacts of the heat at the US Open, I spoke to Nigel Adely.
22:11.240 - 22:15.900:  Well, like the rest of the United States, New York is undergoing an extreme heat wave at the
22:15.900 - 22:20.900:  moment, temperatures in excess of 35 degrees Celsius, and if you've ever walked around the centre
22:20.900 - 22:26.340:  of New York in the height of summer, there is also the very high humidity, and that is what Medvedev
22:26.340 - 22:32.240:  was talking about during his game. He had to take two medical timeouts to sort out issues with
22:32.240 - 22:36.420:  his breathing, and he was making the point following the game that the conditions were simply
22:36.420 - 22:41.500:  too oppressive to play a game of top quality tennis, and John McEnroe has been saying as well
22:41.500 - 22:47.480:  that he believes it's inhumane to expect people to produce their best tennis in conditions like
22:47.480 - 22:53.480:  this, usually rain is an issue. At the US Open tennis, played in September, they do have a roof
22:53.480 - 22:58.880:  now on the main show courts, including the Arthur Ashe Stadium, and it has been partially closed
22:58.880 - 23:04.760:  to help players deal with the heat during the day, but there is no policy to close it entirely,
23:04.760 - 23:08.980:  to block out the sun and the heat and maybe get the air conditioning going to make life more
23:08.980 - 23:14.400:  comfortable for the players and spectators. Do they perhaps need to have a policy where if the
23:14.400 - 23:19.440:  temperature hits a certain level, then these kind of measures should come in? There is a precedent
23:19.440 - 23:25.140:  set, the Australian Open does have a heat protocol now, and there were delays during their tournament
23:25.140 - 23:30.160:  back in January of this year, because it just got too hot on the outside courts, and while they
23:30.160 - 23:35.140:  could play under the cover in the main stadium courts, basically the players would take it off
23:35.140 - 23:40.560:  because it wasn't deemed safe for them to play. The Medvedev was saying following his game that he
23:40.560 - 23:45.260:  appreciates there's an issue there, but he doesn't really have an answer to solve it in the evening
23:45.260 - 23:50.500:  when it may be cooler, there simply isn't enough time to get the games played and also satisfy
23:50.500 - 23:55.460:  the TV schedule. It isn't just tennis that's affected by heat, we saw earlier in the air, the
23:55.460 - 24:00.660:  Tour de France, they were spraying the roads with water so they didn't melt, and then in football
24:00.660 - 24:05.700:  we've had Qatar World Cup move to the winter to avoid the extreme heat, but they're playing football
24:05.700 - 24:11.080:  in Saudi Arabia as well. Their season has just got underway in some very hot conditions, and maybe
24:11.080 - 24:17.660:  the solution found for Qatar is the way forward because it caused a huge amount of disruption to
24:17.660 - 24:22.900:  the schedules across World Football, particularly in Europe when the World Cup was moved to the winter,
24:22.900 - 24:29.220:  but it did mean that the stadiums were safe. Football has also instituted calling breaks during
24:29.220 - 24:34.680:  games now. I'm sure we will see plenty of those over the weekend when the European International
24:34.680 - 24:39.960:  Qualifiers resume because of course Europe is undergoing a heat wave, and I'm sure that the
24:39.960 - 24:44.460:  players will be grateful for any sort of break during some very oppressive conditions coming up
24:44.460 - 24:50.920:  over the next few days. Nigel Adely. Last weekend, an estimated 7,000 people blocked a kilometer
24:50.920 - 24:57.280:  long stretch of road in the German capital Berlin as part of a protest come rave. The event which
24:57.280 - 25:02.660:  brought together clubbers, climate activists and local residents was permitted by the Berlin
25:03.360 - 25:07.860:  authorities as a demonstration against the extension of a major motorway. The BBC's Damian
25:07.860 - 25:17.200:  McGinnis was there. Disco balls, smoke machines and stalls selling beer as people dance between
25:17.200 - 25:23.460:  the traffic lights and street signs, but this is not a party but a protest against a motorway
25:23.460 - 25:28.340:  that threatens to run through this Berlin neighbourhood, destroying homes, cultural venues and
25:28.340 - 25:37.120:  half a dozen of Berlin's edgeless nightclubs. It would be a total nightmare. I'm both sad and
25:37.120 - 25:43.480:  angry, Selena, a clubber who lives nearby, tells me. She says the motorway would destroy a lot of
25:43.480 - 25:51.840:  the underground culture that makes Berlin so unique in the first place. But during a forrocious
25:51.840 - 25:57.100:  debate in the German parliament earlier this year, conservative politicians argued that the motorway
25:57.100 - 26:02.100:  was needed to ease the flow of traffic in Berlin because of its growing population.
26:07.080 - 26:12.560:  One of the clubs under threat is about blank where Ellie Stefan works. She argues that the motorway
26:12.560 - 26:17.820:  would simply increase congestion. It would destroy the neighbourhood, it would bring even more
26:17.820 - 26:24.200:  traffic into the city. Berlin is already totally stuffed with cars, it makes more sense to invest more
26:24.200 - 26:32.740:  into public transport. This area still has a similar atmosphere to the wild 90s in Berlin after
26:32.740 - 26:38.560:  the fall of the wall when alternative nightlife headed east, taking over the crumbling empty buildings
26:38.560 - 26:45.660:  of a central district of Mitter. This amateur footage from the 1990s shows Eimer or Bucket in German.
26:45.660 - 26:51.820:  A crumbling squat turned nightclub. I remember going, it had a small red bucket above the door instead
26:51.820 - 26:56.920:  of a sign, and inside you could look down on the dance floor from the upper floors because most
26:56.920 - 27:02.140:  of the ceilings had fallen in. Eimer was closed down more than 20 years ago and the building now
27:02.140 - 27:08.720:  houses expensive apartments, alternative nightlife left Mitter years ago to cheaper, less central
27:08.720 - 27:15.280:  areas such as Friedrichsheim where the rave is happening. Amperia, a DJ from about blank, performed
27:24.140 - 27:29.720:  at the protest. This rave is just part of a broader ideological battle in Berlin over the car,
27:30.340 - 27:36.100:  on the one side you have often younger people or green voters, the people here who say they want
27:36.100 - 27:42.520:  better bike paths, more funding for public transport and fewer cars. On the other you have drivers,
27:42.520 - 27:46.500:  they say they need the car to get to work, particularly if you live on the outskirts of the city
27:46.500 - 27:51.840:  and they want more rights for drivers and better roads. It's an issue over which elections are
27:51.840 - 27:58.840:  fought in Berlin and it divides the city into. Damian McGuinister reporting from the German
27:58.840 - 28:05.360:  capital. It lasted less than a day and claimed relatively few lives, but the volcanic eruption in
28:05.360 - 28:11.420:  Tonga in January last year has already broken numerous records. It produced the biggest atmospheric
28:11.420 - 28:18.400:  explosion ever recorded and was the most powerful eruption since Krakatoa in 1883. Now it's set
28:18.400 - 28:23.240:  another record for its effect under the sea as I heard from our science correspondent Jonathan
28:23.240 - 28:28.320:  Amos. To explain to you what that new record is, I'll just remind you of one other record, Oli,
28:28.380 - 28:33.880:  which is that this volcano produced the highest ever eruption plume. So it's sent about six cubic
28:33.880 - 28:40.800:  kilometers of material, rock and ash, up into the sky and that material went up to about 60 kilometers,
28:41.160 - 28:45.740:  more than halfway to space and of course an awful lot of it came straight back down and it went
28:45.740 - 28:50.920:  into the ocean like a jet and hit the sides of the volcano, 40 degrees slopes and then it started
28:50.920 - 28:56.760:  to run out and when you get these flows of material on the sea floor, sometimes down canyons,
28:56.960 - 29:01.780:  landslides underwater but in this case on the sides of a volcano we call them density currency
29:01.900 - 29:06.740:  and in this instance they've been able to time precisely how quickly they were moving and they
29:06.740 - 29:15.900:  clock speeds of up to 120 kilometers an hour. So imagine a wall of rock and ash and water coming
29:15.900 - 29:21.740:  towards you at 75 miles an hour on the sea floor and of course that dug out great big channels on
29:21.740 - 29:27.800:  the sea floor and it also smothered and killed life everywhere in its path. And is that the result of
29:27.800 - 29:33.160:  the power of the explosion or the way that the volcano was structured? It was a perfect storm.
29:33.280 - 29:37.020:  The amount of material that was chucked up the height of which it went and then the fact that
29:37.020 - 29:41.960:  it came down like a jet into the water down the sides of the volcano and then spread out.
29:42.260 - 29:46.560:  How did they get the speed? That's quite an interesting question. One of the impacts from this
29:46.560 - 29:51.780:  volcano was that Tonga lost its connection to the internet. So there are two cables that
29:51.780 - 29:56.780:  disperse the internet service around Tonga. One of them comes from the global internet and then
29:56.780 - 30:02.240:  there's a local cable that goes out to all of the islands. That first cable break occurred on the
30:02.240 - 30:07.280:  local one so that was within a few tens of kilometers of the volcano so they timed from the
30:07.280 - 30:11.980:  eruption to when the cable breaks. That gives you the speed and they did that also for the international
30:11.980 - 30:18.520:  cable which was some 70 kilometers away and yet this debris was moving so fast that it picked up
30:18.520 - 30:23.760:  almost a hundred kilometers of that cable and just destroyed it. Our science correspondent Jonathan
30:23.760 - 30:30.660:  Amos 140,000 people visited Sotheby's auction house in London over the past few weeks to see
30:30.660 - 30:36.280:  hundreds of items that belonged to the late Queen Singer Freddie Mercury. The first of several
30:36.280 - 30:41.080:  auctions has now taken place there with items like his piano and handwritten lyrics selling
30:41.080 - 30:44.140:  for millions of dollars with the details his Daniel Mann.
30:49.720 - 30:53.180:  Revealing untold insights into other possible directions the song could have taken.
30:53.680 - 30:57.500:  One page reveals that Freddie originally planned to call the song Mongolia in Rhapsody.
31:00.540 - 31:05.740:  It was bought by Freddie in 1975 after an arduous six-month search for the ideal instrument to
31:05.740 - 31:15.240:  bring to life his ambitious songs. Bohemian Rhapsody was a marriage of Freddie Mercury's
31:15.240 - 31:20.780:  love of opera with rock music which he composed along with many other Queen songs on his cherished
31:20.780 - 31:27.240:  Yamaha piano and selling it here at Sotheby's for the baby grand final warning at 1,400,000
31:27.240 - 31:32.540:  sold to you. Thank you very, very much indeed. The auctioneer Oliver Barker
31:32.540 - 31:38.740:  described the lyrics for Bohemian Rhapsody as a modern cultural icon. The 15 pages of the song's
31:38.740 - 31:43.960:  words and comments by Freddie and written in his hand sold for at 1,100,000 pounds.
31:46.300 - 31:52.000:  2,000 bidders from 61 countries have registered to take part in the auctions with part of the
31:52.000 - 31:57.260:  proceeds going to the Elton John AIDS Foundation. In a message read out by Oliver Barker,
31:57.460 - 32:03.400:  the singer said, I'm miss Freddie to this day. He was a wonderful friend whose music has inspired
32:03.400 - 32:08.960:  and thrilled millions and it was a tragedy that AIDS took him from the world much too soon.
32:09.320 - 32:18.340:  4,000 bidders from 61 countries have registered to take part in the auctions.
32:18.540 - 32:25.500:  They're reported by Daniel Mann. That's all from us for now, but the global news podcast
32:25.500 - 32:31.120:  will be back very soon. This edition was mixed by Alicia Thurston. The producer was Emma Joseph,
32:31.120 - 32:34.780:  our editor's Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
