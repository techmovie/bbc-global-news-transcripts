*01:17.160- 01:23.440* :  of the strict regime prison colony in Siberia 3000 kilometers away from Moscow and we
*01:23.440- 01:31.040* :  deploy that attacks by Russian armed forces harming civilian and medical facilities which have
*01:31.040- 01:37.920* :  protected status continue to take place. UN investigators find evidence of war crimes by Russian
*01:37.920- 01:48.680* :  troops including torture and sexual violence in Ukraine. People are pouring across the border
*01:48.680- 01:55.220* :  from the Gorno-Carabakh into Armenia largely from the main city to Panakert. It comes after Azerbaijan
*01:55.220- 02:01.560* :  seized the region which is in its territory but has a majority ethnic Armenian population. BBC
*02:01.560- 02:08.140* :  Russians Natalia Zatova is at the border. We are now in the village of Karnizor right on the border
*02:08.140- 02:13.560* :  between Armenia and Nagorno-Carabakh. We can see the refugees coming and coming through the border
*02:13.560- 02:18.940* :  to Armenia. Here in this tent they have been registered. People are fleeing with their belongings
*02:18.940- 02:25.120* :  because they are afraid they just don't believe they can be safe in Nagorno-Carabakh under Azerbaijan
*02:25.120- 02:31.220* :  rule. Some people told me that they don't expect to get home ever. Among the terrified population
*02:31.220- 02:41.560* :  is Surinosh Sargsyan. I just wake up it's very early morning and it's indescribable
*02:44.120- 02:53.160* :  feelings like you feel this is your your last mornings. The Armenian government says nearly 5,000
*02:53.200- 02:58.180* :  people have joined the Exodus. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's victorious president has been meeting
*02:58.180- 03:03.980* :  Turkey's president and ally in a high-profile territory which belongs to Azerbaijan but is
*03:03.980- 03:10.660* :  separated from the rest of it by areas of Armenia. I spoke to Kazranaji who's in the capital of
*03:10.660- 03:17.020* :  Armenia Yerevan. I'm standing by the side of the government building which is covered with police
*03:17.020- 03:24.580* :  and riot police in front of it because they are expecting anti-government demonstrations here.
*03:24.580- 03:30.900* :  Protesters have been demonstrating here for the last few days blaming the government for not
*03:30.900- 03:40.520* :  doing enough to secure Carabakh and also for not doing enough to defend the people of Carabakh.
*03:41.080- 03:48.260* :  And here they are expecting thousands tens of thousands of people to pour over into Armenia.
*03:48.260- 03:56.240* :  Most of them probably heading here to Yerevan and we're not sure whether the government here is
*03:56.240- 04:05.320* :  prepared in any meaningful way for receiving so many refugees. What are people saying about
*04:05.400- 04:11.780* :  Russia so long the guarantor in this situation and its peacekeepers? That's right there's a lot
*04:11.780- 04:18.620* :  of blame going around and we had the prime minister here Nicole Pashinyan yesterday making a
*04:18.920- 04:26.180* :  televised speech in which he seemed to blame Russia for not doing enough because they are supposed
*04:26.180- 04:34.220* :  to be well supposed to be peacekeepers and yet they allowed Azerbaijan forces to take over the
*04:34.220- 04:40.480* :  whole of the Carabakh for the first time in history with the force of arms and today the latest
*04:40.480- 04:47.900* :  we're getting is that the town of Marta Ket which is just north of the panicked in Carabakh
*04:48.240- 04:55.000* :  has been taken over completely by Azerbaijanis and we hear that about thousand cars have been
*04:55.000- 05:01.960* :  heading towards the panicked to leave the area and there are pictures of Azerbaijanis soldiers
*05:01.960- 05:11.180* :  putting up are very flags everywhere in the town so the situation is pretty volatile and Russia
*05:11.580- 05:19.780* :  is taking a lot of blame for not doing enough and there seems to be a change in terms of the strategic
*05:20.360- 05:26.460* :  leaning of Armenia in the sense that yesterday in his speech the president seemed to be leaning
*05:26.460- 05:34.260* :  to the west away from Russia so that is playing out at the same time we have Turkey and
*05:34.260- 05:40.420* :  Azerbaijanis presidents of Turkey and Azerbaijan today meeting in Najjavan which is a very provocative
*05:40.460- 05:49.860* :  thing to do here which speaks to the fears that Azerbaijan has even more territorial ambitions
*05:49.860- 05:56.140* :  in this region particularly in the south along the border with Iran where they want a corridor
*05:56.140- 06:04.040* :  a given to Azerbaijanis or put under the control of Russian peacekeepers so that they can open a
*06:04.040- 06:09.340* :  link between Azerbaijan and Turkey. Kasra Naji in Yerevan Armenia
*06:10.400- 06:15.680* :  The Hollywood writers strike as damage the world of TV putting all manner of shows off air
*06:15.680- 06:22.100* :  or stopping their recording well it could soon be over the disputes which centred on pay and the
*06:22.100- 06:27.880* :  impact of artificial intelligence on writers halted most film and television production for nearly
*06:27.880- 06:33.960* :  five months the trade union which represents around 11,000 writers the writers Guild of America
*06:34.500- 06:40.380* :  has reached preliminary agreement with studio bosses to end the dispute but Hollywood actors remain
*06:40.380- 06:47.740* :  on strike in a parallel dispute my colleague Justin Webb spoke to Liz Alper a television writer and
*06:47.740- 06:54.220* :  producer in Hollywood we've just received a tentative agreement which basically means that the
*06:54.220- 07:00.040* :  writers Guild of America as well as the alliance of motion picture and television producers who are
*07:00.040- 07:05.320* :  the collective of CEOs and our employers who we've been negotiating against they've agreed
*07:05.320- 07:11.820* :  to the broad deal points in the next few days our legal team as well as the alliance of motion
*07:11.820- 07:17.540* :  picture and television producers the AMPTPs legal team are going to be sussing out you know the
*07:17.540- 07:22.540* :  finer details and once that happens they're going to bring that back to the membership so right now
*07:22.540- 07:28.400* :  we don't know what's in the deal we do know that if our negotiating committee is happy with it
*07:28.640- 07:33.180* :  then that means we must have gotten a very good deal because we have a very bullish negotiating
*07:33.180- 07:37.960* :  committee who has been dedicated to making sure we get the best deal possible for our members
*07:38.180- 07:43.480* :  right so the bottom line is that people who write for for television and films will get more
*07:43.480- 07:47.480* :  money for what they do we're going to get a lot more than that we're going to be getting protections
*07:47.660- 07:53.840* :  both in the workplace and from artificial intelligence that was a major point of contention
*07:53.840- 08:00.660* :  in these negotiations and according to the email that we did receive we got major wins for each
*08:00.660- 08:05.700* :  part of the membership so that would be the comedy variety writers who cover talk shows and
*08:05.700- 08:11.600* :  comedy variety shows the screenwriters and the television writers so in all of those areas we've
*08:11.600- 08:16.380* :  made major gains right so this is a really big deal and when are the people and other creative
*08:16.380- 08:22.980* :  sectors not just screenwriting across the world look at what you've achieved it sounds to me
*08:22.980- 08:28.620* :  as if particularly with the AI side of it this is potentially quite quite a big thing for them it
*08:28.620- 08:33.080* :  is and I think I really truly hope that people who are watching us from around the world
*08:33.080- 08:38.460* :  take to heart that collective action and collective bargaining and standing together with your
*08:38.460- 08:43.780* :  fellow employees is going to be the way that the workers get their rightful share because right
*08:43.780- 08:49.060* :  now workers all over the world are being replaced by AI or they're just being replaced because
*08:49.240- 08:55.640* :  of companies contracting so I do hope that people are looking at this and realizing what the power
*08:55.640- 09:01.280* :  of solidarity looks like did you get the kind of support that you needed from the stars that you're
*09:01.280- 09:05.700* :  right for I mean one or two did sort of toy with going back didn't they and then rethought that
*09:05.700- 09:11.220* :  how's it been what's it done to relationships behind the scenes a lot of us in Hollywood are not
*09:11.220- 09:19.140* :  familiar with how labor action works and the strength of that and so I think what you saw were
*09:19.620- 09:27.280* :  were stars who were coming from a place of unsureity and I think this has been a big educational
*09:27.280- 09:33.740* :  process for a lot of us who have come out of this action maybe with different feelings towards
*09:33.740- 09:39.920* :  the labor movement I think in the past we've all been separated basically pitted against one
*09:39.920- 09:45.960* :  another in order to make sure that our focus was on who was taking our share of the pie rather
*09:45.960- 09:53.720* :  than who was holding our pie hostage. Hollywood's Liz Alper there is continuous evidence that
*09:53.720- 09:59.220* :  Russian armed forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine that's the verdict of the latest
*09:59.220- 10:04.520* :  United Nations report into the conflict the independent international commission of inquiry
*10:04.520- 10:10.000* :  on Ukraine says it's documented attacks on civilians torture and sexual violence
*10:10.000- 10:16.360* :  Rinder Grover is a member of the commission. We deploy that attacks by Russian armed forces
*10:17.020- 10:23.960* :  harming civilian and medical facilities which have protected status continue to take place
*10:24.880- 10:31.500* :  the commission also deploys the fact that conflict related sexual violence continues to take
*10:31.500- 10:38.880* :  place in violation of international humanitarian law and human rights and it says it's still
*10:38.880- 10:44.500* :  investigating the breach of the Novakakovka dam in June along with allegations of genocide
*10:44.540- 10:50.700* :  and the forced transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia I spoke to Ageneva correspondent
*10:50.700- 10:56.240* :  Imogen folks who's been studying the report's findings. Well what the UN team have looked at is
*10:56.240- 11:03.520* :  events since March of this year and there they have documented attacks on at least one hospital
*11:03.660- 11:11.120* :  restaurants railway station shops all things that civilians use civilian infrastructure
*11:11.980- 11:18.000* :  now under international law it's not just that a warring party is not supposed to actively target
*11:18.000- 11:24.700* :  things like that they are supposed to actively avoid them and seek out only military targets
*11:25.220- 11:31.180* :  so here we see this is where the UN team is saying this is a possible war crime
*11:31.440- 11:37.160* :  and these horrific allegations to have individuals being tortured or subject to sexual attacks
*11:37.800- 11:41.860* :  this is a really really dark picture again of the way Russia appears to be conducting
*11:41.860- 11:47.980* :  it's war against Ukraine the UN team was able to visit places that the Russians had occupied
*11:47.980- 11:54.680* :  which Ukraine has now retaken so cares on Zaporizha there they found widespread evidence of
*11:54.680- 12:01.440* :  torture of people detained by Russian troops a suspected perhaps of passing information to Ukrainian
*12:01.440- 12:08.020* :  forces tortured in one case so brutally that the individual died then sexual violence
*12:08.800- 12:18.380* :  including of in one case an 83 year old woman so again not the conduct of war that the Geneva
*12:18.380- 12:23.700* :  convention says armies should be should be following in no way at all yeah and it goes further
*12:23.700- 12:29.860* :  commission says other claims are still being investigated including on genocide what more do we
*12:29.860- 12:35.300* :  know about this this is too pronged thing contained in today's report first of all there is the
*12:35.300- 12:43.400* :  suggestion that Ukrainian children have been forcibly transferred to Russia now the UN team says
*12:43.860- 12:49.320* :  we are getting so little information they really want Moscow to cooperate here and says if you've
*12:49.320- 12:54.760* :  done this who are these children where are they they need to be returned and reunited with
*12:54.760- 13:02.440* :  their parents forcible transfer of children in this way could amount to genocide under the genocide
*13:02.440- 13:09.680* :  convention the other thing very interesting I thought that the UN team mentioned today was that
*13:09.680- 13:17.660* :  the rhetoric in Russian state media and the only media allowed in Russia left now is one that
*13:17.660- 13:25.540* :  supports the government that has become so hate-filled so violent that it in and on of itself
*13:25.540- 13:33.820* :  could constitute incitement to genocide imagine folks shares in the embattled Chinese property
*13:33.820- 13:38.940* :  company ever grant have plummeted once again after it said it would delay a plan to restructure
*13:38.940- 13:44.600* :  its massive debts the plan is intended to save the world's most indebted property developer
*13:44.600- 13:51.000* :  from collapse our reporter Nick Marsh spoke to me from our Asia business hub in Singapore ever
*13:51.000- 13:58.320* :  grand owes a tremendous amount of money to a lot of people Alex most of it is owed within China
*13:58.320- 14:03.780* :  so to people for example who bought houses that haven't been finished that kind of thing but
*14:03.780- 14:11.120* :  their big concern in terms of survival is actually the 10% that they owe to creditors outside of
*14:11.120- 14:16.940* :  China the thirty one billion dollars worth of bonds that creditors have bought from ever ground
*14:17.380- 14:22.900* :  now they defaulted on these debts two years ago pretty much because the Chinese government said
*14:22.900- 14:28.440* :  you can't borrow any more money you've already borrowed too much and this is a kind of a bubble
*14:28.440- 14:32.980* :  forming within the property market and since then over these last two years they've desperately
*14:33.300- 14:37.260* :  been scrambling to come up with a repayment plan it looked like they were getting close they
*14:37.260- 14:42.140* :  wanted to reissue this these debts as new bonds that they have to pay back in about 10 years time
*14:42.140- 14:46.920* :  but they can't do that because one of their subsidiaries which is called Hengda real estate
*14:46.940- 14:52.600* :  their under investigation by Chinese regulators for breaching rules around disclosure of data so
*14:52.600- 14:56.520* :  they can't issue any new debt and they're back to the drawing board it's a really big blow
*14:56.920- 15:03.180* :  for ever ground and the fear is that this could spill over into well the rest of China's economy
*15:03.660- 15:07.780* :  yeah we're hearing a lot about spill over contagion whatever you want to call it
*15:08.240- 15:12.940* :  that's completely understandable property is worth about a quarter of the whole of China's GDP
*15:12.940- 15:16.960* :  and obviously when you think of property collapse you think of what happened in the United States
*15:16.960- 15:22.420* :  in 2008 the subprime mortgages the banking system going into meltdown global financial crisis
*15:23.140- 15:27.960* :  I think the general consensus that I get when I speak to China experts economists people like that
*15:28.980- 15:34.020* :  firstly China's property sector isn't as plugged into the broader financial system as the
*15:34.020- 15:39.060* :  American one was because over there you had banks literally buying and selling people's mortgages
*15:39.060- 15:44.400* :  and things like that and also that banks are better protected and regulated in China so that
*15:44.400- 15:49.260* :  kind of collapses less likely and also in terms of the effect on the wider world China's financial
*15:49.260- 15:55.200* :  system is nowhere near as dominant as the US wants so in theory you know a collapse wouldn't have
*15:55.200- 16:00.960* :  the same devastating consequences as we saw in the US in 2008 and obviously that's all in theory
*16:00.960- 16:05.700* :  that's not to say that China doesn't have a big big problem with its property sector there's
*16:05.700- 16:11.680* :  so many more houses that have been built than people who want to buy them and so many companies
*16:11.680- 16:16.840* :  have exposed themselves to such huge amounts of debt that that readjustment between their supply
*16:16.840- 16:22.340* :  of houses and the demand for them and therefore the property values that's going to be a really long
*16:22.340- 16:27.420* :  and painful readjustment for the economy and for the people as a whole. Nick Marsh and Singapore
*16:28.700- 16:34.820* :  the Danish toy giant Lego has ditched plans to make its famous children's building blocks from
*16:34.820- 16:41.180* :  recycled plastic bottles claiming the new material actually led to higher emissions as Jacob
*16:41.180- 16:47.480* :  Evans explains. Back in 2021 Lego revealed it and made a new brick made from recycled bottles
*16:48.180- 16:52.480* :  the move was heralded as a big step towards a greener future but after two years of testing
*16:52.480- 16:58.580* :  its plans have fallen to pieces. Lego discovered that making its famous bricks and recycled bottles
*16:58.580- 17:03.720* :  actually produced higher carbon emissions than before. Currently most Lego pieces are made using
*17:03.720- 17:08.480* :  something called ABS, a special type of plastic that gives Lego bricks their durability
*17:08.480- 17:13.780* :  and their famous ability to be stuck together and pulled apart but to make a kilo of ABS
*17:14.260- 17:18.260* :  Lego needs two kilos of crude oil hence the wish to shrink its polluting footprint
*17:18.260- 17:23.920* :  but replacing ABS has proved difficult with Lego's head of sustainability Tim Brooks saying
*17:23.920- 17:28.600* :  it's like trying to make a bike out of wood rather than steel. Lego is now turning its attention
*17:28.600- 17:34.100* :  to making the existing ABS bricks more sustainable by using more recycled material and tripling
*17:34.100- 17:45.080* :  its spending on sustainability by 2025 Jacob Evans still to cut it's quite easy to disarm
*17:45.080- 17:50.100* :  mines but the threat is changing and more and more the Russians prepare booby traps around the
*17:50.100- 17:54.800* :  minefields the painstaking work to clear Ukraine's minefields

*18:07.500- 18:12.000* :  it might make you excited whoa didn't know my car was value this high it might make you nervous
*18:12.220- 18:16.960* :  uh oh markets flooded my car's value just dipped 2.3 percent it might make you optimistic
*18:17.100- 18:20.980* :  our low mileage is paying off our values up and it might make you realistic
*18:20.980- 18:25.300* :  hmm car prices haven't gone up in a couple weeks maybe it's time to sell but it will definitely

*19:26.800- 19:33.880* :  and who has survived two poisonings since 2015 was given a 25-year prison sentence in April
*19:33.880- 19:39.560* :  after being accused of treason and spreading false information about the war in Ukraine
*19:39.560- 19:45.920* :  my colleague Victoria Uwan Kunda spoke to his wife Evgenia Karamazah who is currently in France
*19:46.460- 19:51.080* :  Liz decision has not come as a surprise my husband has received
*19:51.860- 19:57.820* :  to so far the longest sentence against a Russian opposition politician in Russia
*19:58.580- 20:04.940* :  for standing up to Vladimir Putin and I do realize that the regime sees my husband as a personal
*20:04.940- 20:10.880* :  enemy for his involvement in the advocacy for the Magnitsky sanctions since 2010
*20:11.520- 20:17.300* :  the personal targeted sanctions that are used against human rights violators now around the world
*20:18.100- 20:22.360* :  so this sentence they don't come as a surprise and of course the fact that Vladimir will be
*20:22.360- 20:28.140* :  serving this sentence in a strict regime prison colony where he was indeed brought on the 21st
*20:28.140- 20:34.520* :  of September where he was put straight away into a punishment cell so now he's being kept
*20:34.520- 20:40.860* :  in a punishment cell of the strict regime prison colony in Siberia 3000 kilometers away from
*20:40.860- 20:46.900* :  Moscow have you been able to speak to him I have not had direct contact with Vladimir
*20:48.120- 20:53.920* :  well actually end of August I was lucky to have a short phone conversation with him and the
*20:53.920- 21:01.740* :  last time the lawyers actually saw him was on August the 28th on September the 4th he was sent on
*21:01.740- 21:09.700* :  this transfer and well the lawyers were just recently able to locate him in this prison and there
*21:09.700- 21:15.400* :  hasn't of course been any direct contact how are his periods when you last spoke him in August
*21:16.600- 21:23.000* :  oh well his periods are have always been high and he's you know he says that it is the fact that
*21:23.000- 21:29.760* :  he's a historian by formation by education that makes him an optimist he says that it's not just
*21:29.760- 21:35.420* :  you know there's silly optimism of someone who doesn't know anything but the optimism of a man
*21:35.420- 21:42.680* :  who knows how history works and he believes that all dictatorships and in the end in the same way
*21:43.440- 21:50.700* :  so yeah his spirits are always high and he manages to keep his sense of humor which I'm sure
*21:50.700- 21:57.120* :  helps him survive as it helps survive so many Soviet dissidents before him and of course his
*21:57.120- 22:04.820* :  sense of humor keeps me going as well Evgenia Karamurza Ukraine is now the most heavily mined country
*22:04.820- 22:09.580* :  in the world with hundreds of thousands of explosive devices littering the ground slowing
*22:09.580- 22:15.360* :  Kiev's offensive operations now members of the Ukrainian Army are receiving specialist training
*22:15.360- 22:22.140* :  from British Army bomb disposal teams in how to clear Russian minefields the members of the royal
*22:22.140- 22:28.640* :  engineers also known as sappers faced similar deadly obstacles in Afghanistan our defense correspondent
*22:28.640- 22:35.160* :  Jonathan Beal has been to see the training taking place okay your mission today is to clear all
*22:35.160- 22:41.180* :  these defensive positions so we can occupy them at a military base in southeast Poland
*22:41.260- 22:48.420* :  British Army engineers prepare a team of Ukrainian sappers for the most deadly of tasks clear
*22:48.420- 22:54.280* :  and occupy and gather intelligence from this building clearing their way through a field laid
*22:54.280- 23:01.020* :  with potentially deadly surprises mines and booby traps this time without the explosives
*23:02.060- 23:06.960* :  Captain Chris Wilson is from three five engineer regiment the important thing is that we're
*23:06.960- 23:11.020* :  training them the correct skills and drills that they can replicate for themselves on the battlefield
*23:11.020- 23:19.620* :  to ensure that their survivability and their safety goes up the squawk of the mine detector
*23:20.020- 23:25.200* :  is very familiar to some of these British trainers too you've had to do this in Afghanistan
*23:26.400- 23:32.740* :  but the threat facing the Ukrainian sappers is way beyond what was faced in the heat and dust of
*23:32.740- 23:39.960* :  helmet Russia's laid hundreds of thousands of mines scattered over an area the size of Florida
*23:40.620- 23:45.060* :  and in some places those minefields are 10 kilometers deep
*23:49.380- 23:55.960* :  back home dense Russian minefields have slowed down Ukraine's advances repeatedly stalled
*23:55.960- 24:02.140* :  it's offensive okay he's going to get other people to take cover I'm not going to explore it
*24:02.360- 24:09.420* :  I wanted to make it safe like most of those being trained in Poland then is an already experience
*24:09.420- 24:16.220* :  military engineer he's also lost comrades he says Ukraine simply doesn't have enough sappers
*24:16.660- 24:22.240* :  to deal with the threat would you describe being a sapper in Ukraine at the moment as being the
*24:22.240- 24:30.520* :  most dangerous job in the world yes absolutely what message would you like the to send the west keep
*24:30.520- 24:45.920* :  going we need to help because we want to make it by our own it's not just the industrial scale
*24:46.880- 24:53.980* :  it's the variety too we have projectiles some RPG rock propel grenades mortars and the vehicle
*24:54.700- 25:01.440* :  they're also having to work within range of enemy fire they're being targeted so most of their
*25:01.440- 25:08.300* :  work has to be done at night Igor has already lost 10 members of his explosive ordinance team he says
*25:08.300- 25:18.140* :  they're having to deal with hundreds of devices a day it's quite easy to disarm mines but the
*25:18.140- 25:23.780* :  threat is changing and more and more the Russians prepare booby traps around the minefields that's
*25:23.780- 25:29.180* :  making it more difficult for us individually really good skills you literally found everything
*25:29.180- 25:35.740* :  that was out today it's not just the Ukrainian engineers who are learning here so two of the British
*25:35.740- 25:43.100* :  trainers whose expertise they specifically requested staff sergeant Kevin Strom is another who's
*25:43.100- 25:48.180* :  served in Afghanistan we're fellow soldiers at the end of the day we share experiences throughout
*25:48.180- 25:54.480* :  the course of our experiences and their experiences and we train together the course is just a few
*25:54.480- 26:01.900* :  weeks respite all the time the Ukrainian sappers can spare before they give back to the front to
*26:01.900- 26:08.820* :  risk their lives for their comrades our defense correspondent Jonathan Biel a man known as the
*26:08.820- 26:17.120* :  last godfather has died aged 62 after falling into a coma Matteo Messina Denaro spent 30 years on
*26:17.120- 26:22.960* :  the run from authorities over his ties to the Sicilian mafia but was finally arrested in January
*26:22.960- 26:29.300* :  after seeking treatment for cancer Stephanie Prentice told me more this was a man who was born into
*26:29.300- 26:35.320* :  a mafia family he was the son of a mafia boss his brother and sister were in the mafia and by
*26:35.320- 26:40.660* :  the time he rose the top of the ranks he was Italy's most wanted criminal now he's set to be
*26:40.660- 26:46.700* :  active in organized crime as a young teenager to a first kill to mom when he was 18 in terms of
*26:46.700- 26:52.420* :  his character he was known for liking fast cars designer clothes being somewhat flashy compared
*26:52.420- 26:58.880* :  to his predecessors but also for being cunning and for being ruthless in his pursuit of power he
*26:58.880- 27:04.140* :  was nicknamed diabolic and the kosanostromob that he eventually became the leader of was responsible
*27:04.140- 27:09.980* :  for crimes that shocked the public in Italy some of which actually sparked the crackdown of the mob
*27:09.980- 27:15.560* :  in the 90s which saw Mr Denaro having to go on the run authorities and judges at the time they
*27:15.560- 27:21.800* :  were just aggressively pursuing those mafia bosses so during that time Mr Denaro was convicted in
*27:21.800- 27:27.620* :  absentia of dozens of murders though he's reported as actually saying he'd killed in his words
*27:28.040- 27:33.440* :  enough people to fill a graveyard now that included the killings of a prominent anti-Mafia
*27:33.440- 27:38.900* :  prosecutor and a judge in the 90s when the mafia insists he just had a real hold on that region
*27:39.300- 27:45.100* :  it included the kidnapping of a 12 year old boy for two years while trying to blackmail his parents
*27:45.100- 27:50.980* :  he was eventually murdered and dissolved in acid and bombings in Rome Florence and Milan that
*27:50.980- 27:57.180* :  killed 10 people and really terrified people there just what do we know about how he got caught
*27:57.180- 28:02.760* :  and how he died well he was on the run for three decades he was Italy's biggest fugitive
*28:02.760- 28:06.720* :  but police said they were disappointed to learn that he'd been hiding close to his hometown
*28:06.780- 28:12.280* :  for a lot of that time and living a relatively normal life they put that down to the culture of
*28:12.280- 28:18.200* :  fear around the mafia in that region but they put wiretaps on the phones of his friends and family
*28:18.200- 28:24.060* :  recorded some quite ambiguous conversations about an unnamed person having treatment for cancer
*28:24.540- 28:29.420* :  and they used that sort of a hone in on him they checked medical records in the area to see if anyone
*28:29.420- 28:34.940* :  was being treated and he'd been getting treatment for colon cancer using a false name and it was a name
*28:34.940- 28:41.360* :  that did have ties to an old mafia boss so they used that to eventually get to him now the police
*28:41.360- 28:47.620* :  at the time said they believed he held the key to numerous unsolved crimes including dozens of murders
*28:48.200- 28:52.820* :  but it said that he refused to give any information to the police some reports say he actually
*28:52.820- 28:58.100* :  denied being in the mafia at all and now of course that knowledge has died with him Stephanie
*28:58.100- 29:05.980* :  Prentice some good news now from the natural world numbers of one of the most endangered animals the
*29:05.980- 29:13.160* :  rhinoceros have increased slightly to 27,000 in spite of the twin threats of poaching and mass
*29:13.160- 29:19.920* :  habitat loss Dr Sam Ferrera is the scientific officer of the African Rhino specialist group
*29:20.380- 29:25.560* :  in the last year we've seen an increase of about five and a half percent of Africa's rhinos
*29:26.120- 29:30.700* :  and that is a big increase because big animals like rhinos don't necessarily breed
*29:30.700- 29:36.580* :  fast like rats and mice so that kind of an increase in one year is a remarkable achievement
*29:37.280- 29:42.600* :  and rhinos play a big role in Africa they can play ecological roles and so forth but people relate
*29:42.600- 29:48.220* :  to them quite strongly she got to their cultures some of the benefits that they can get from rhinos
*29:48.220- 29:54.760* :  for example medicinal use of rhino dung is a good example and rhinos are of course a very large
*29:54.760- 30:00.040* :  animal and we certainly know that the right across African systems when you have got large animals
*30:00.040- 30:06.500* :  they tend to do other things for other species like a rhino create across areas where other species
*30:06.500- 30:13.440* :  can graze like for example valibius or Ebola and those sort of aspects have got big spinoffs
*30:13.980- 30:19.680* :  for ecosystem resilience or how well ecosystem is functioning of course as humans are quite
*30:19.680- 30:24.760* :  dependent on nature and the services that provide so yes they do play a very important role in
*30:24.760- 30:29.780* :  creating and making sure that some of these functions of animal systems are still there and
*30:29.780- 30:36.160* :  certainly what we see is that when you have partnerships where rhinos are where people are
*30:36.360- 30:41.320* :  working together have got higher population growth rates than the ones where there's just one
*30:41.320- 30:46.000* :  of two groups working I think that's important you know holding hands is a really important
*30:46.420- 30:50.980* :  aspect in achieving this outcomes for rhinos Dr Sam Ferrera
*30:53.940- 30:59.480* :  and that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later
