00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.380:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:17.740 - 00:23.460:  I'm Andrew Pageant, 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, 12 September. These are our main stories.
00:23.500 - 00:27.980:  North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un is in Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin.
00:27.980 - 00:33.200:  Reports from Libya say large parts of the city of Dernar have been destroyed by flooding.
00:33.860 - 00:38.740:  In Jerusalem, there's an unprecedented hearing of Israel's supreme court to determine the future
00:38.740 - 00:45.400:  powers of its judges. Also in this podcast, the possible ocean on a giant exoplanet
00:45.560 - 00:50.960:  light years away. There was phenomenal to know that we can detect this carbon-based molecules
00:50.960 - 00:56.620:  in a habitable zone planet. This is the kind of discoveries that we want to be making.
00:56.700 - 00:58.700:  But could it be a sign of life?
01:02.340 - 01:06.220:  The North Korean leader doesn't leave his country all that often. In the last few hours,
01:06.220 - 01:10.960:  though, he's been traveling in a heavily armored train northeast from Pyongyang and into Russia.
01:11.380 - 01:14.600:  First, let's hear if Mark Horosponant in South Korea, Gene McKenzie.
01:15.020 - 01:20.920:  Kim Jong-un does not leave North Korea often or lightly. The last time he left the country was back
01:20.920 - 01:27.000:  in April 2019 when he actually went to visit Vladimir Putin and Vladivostok for the very
01:27.000 - 01:32.380:  first time the pair met. North Korea, since that time, has become increasingly isolated. You
01:32.380 - 01:37.440:  have talked to the United States with President Donald Trump break down, and ever since it's been
01:37.440 - 01:43.540:  an international pariah, years of border closures and heavy sanctions on the country, have left
01:43.540 - 01:49.560:  it desperately short of food and fuel and money just to keep the country running, but also money
01:49.560 - 01:54.600:  that it needs to fund its nuclear weapons program. It is suspected that one of the things that
01:55.420 - 02:01.180:  Kim might ask of Mr. Putin when he's there is force-sensitive pieces of weapons technology that
02:01.180 - 02:04.540:  could actually allow Mr. Kim to make progress with some of his weapons.
02:05.440 - 02:10.520:  The details of this meeting are veiled in secrecy, but what do we know? I asked our Russia editor
02:10.520 - 02:17.300:  Steve Rosenberg. The word secrecy mystery under wraps come to mind here. I mean, for days,
02:17.300 - 02:23.700:  we were asking the question, will he won't he? Will Kim Jong-un actually go to Russia?
02:23.700 - 02:28.280:  They'd been all kinds of rumors. Then we found out that he'd actually gone on the train and he'd
02:28.280 - 02:33.140:  gone to Russia. Now we're wondering where exactly is he going. It's not clear what the final
02:33.140 - 02:38.840:  destination is. There were all kinds of rumors to begin with that he was going to head to Vladivostok,
02:38.840 - 02:44.740:  because that is where Vladimir Putin is now for the Eastern Economic Forum, and it's where
02:44.740 - 02:52.380:  Kim actually came to in 2019. But it quickly emerged that no, the train wasn't heading to Vladivostok.
02:52.380 - 02:57.860:  It was going in a different direction. All kinds of reports now suggest he may be going,
02:57.860 - 03:04.540:  maybe, to the Russian cosmodrome, the Russian Space Center, Vastochni, and possibly the meeting
03:04.540 - 03:09.520:  with Vladimir Putin could take place there. But there's no confirmation of that, and we still don't
03:09.520 - 03:15.760:  have location time or what they're going to be talking about really. Now, as I understand it,
03:15.780 - 03:21.920:  what we think President Putin wants to get out of this is arms, arms to continue to wage the
03:21.920 - 03:27.160:  war in Ukraine, because so many arms are produced in North Korea. Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
03:27.160 - 03:33.240:  North Korea has a huge defense industry, right, with large-scale production capabilities,
03:33.880 - 03:38.300:  and because Russia's war in Ukraine is grinding on, we're already 19 months in,
03:39.240 - 03:45.020:  in theory Pyongyang could prove to be an invaluable source of munitions for Moscow. Certainly
03:45.020 - 03:50.000:  Washington suspects that that's what the Kremlin's game is here. The United States has claimed
03:50.000 - 03:55.320:  that arms talks between Russia and North Korea have been, quote, actively advancing,
03:56.000 - 04:02.940:  with Russia reportedly seeking supplies of ammunition, artillery shells, possibly anti-tank shells too.
04:02.940 - 04:08.840:  So, again, no confirmation from Russian officials. However, plenty of unsuttle hints dropped
04:08.840 - 04:15.020:  by Russian officials that Russia and North Korea intend to boost military cooperation back in July,
04:15.020 - 04:20.200:  so a couple of months ago, the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shogu became the first Russian
04:20.200 - 04:25.880:  Defense Minister to visit North Korea since the breakup of the Soviet Union. He went to attend
04:25.880 - 04:32.100:  events marking the 70th anniversary of the Korean armistice, and in Pyongyang, King John Un,
04:32.100 - 04:37.480:  quite remarkable pictures, he played tour guide as he got a showed Mr. Shogu around a big weapons
04:37.480 - 04:43.980:  exhibition, and also Mr. Shogu has hinted that joint military exercises could be in the pipeline.
04:44.380 - 04:49.380:  Steve, these are two leaders who many countries don't want much to do with. Is that why they're
04:49.380 - 04:54.100:  drawn together? Yeah, I think so, to an extent. I mean, they have a lot in common, right? Both
04:54.100 - 04:59.940:  their countries are under international sanctions, under international pressure. Both their countries
04:59.940 - 05:06.100:  have been accused of becoming rogue states, and they have a common enemy in the West,
05:06.360 - 05:10.020:  particularly of the United States, and when you have a common enemy, that often brings
05:10.820 - 05:14.640:  world leaders closer together. Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg.
05:15.140 - 05:20.560:  Now, even before that meeting happens, Vladimir Putin has caused something of a surprise at an
05:20.560 - 05:26.040:  international conference he's hosting in the city of Vladivostok. The Eastern Economic Forum is
05:26.040 - 05:30.160:  held every year. It has the aim of attracting foreign investment to Russia's far east,
05:30.600 - 05:35.380:  and Mr. Putin did talk about the level of the rubble, inflation, and taxation, but then talked
05:35.380 - 05:41.580:  about something entirely unrelated to economic matters, saying the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary
05:41.580 - 05:49.480:  in 1956, and of Czechoslovakia in 1968, were both mistakes. Specifically, he said countries should
05:49.480 - 05:54.280:  not have foreign policies, which involved acting against the interests of other peoples,
05:55.000 - 05:59.940:  as spoke to our Europe Regional Editor, Paul Moss. It's hard to overstate how huge these
05:59.940 - 06:04.060:  events were in the 20th century, particularly when we talk about the history of the Cold War.
06:04.620 - 06:09.520:  Czechoslovakia was now split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but back then it was one
06:09.520 - 06:15.520:  country. Czechoslovakia and Hungary both fell under Soviet Union's domination after World War
06:15.520 - 06:22.420:  II, both were communist dictatorships. In 1956, reformers in Hungary tried to loosen the grip of
06:22.420 - 06:27.920:  communism. Czechoslovakia did the same in 1968 with what became known as the Prague Spring, and
06:27.920 - 06:34.320:  there was real hope in the world that the tensions of the Cold War might be eased. All of
06:34.320 - 06:39.300:  those hopes vanished when the Soviet Union, in both cases, sent in the tanks and crushed these
06:39.300 - 06:45.060:  nascent reform movements. Thousands were killed in fighting, the USSR then installed compliant
06:45.060 - 06:50.260:  governments, and basically normal service was resumed. Both countries remained communistic
06:50.260 - 06:55.660:  dictatorships under Moscow's control right up until 1989, when the Soviet bloc collapsed.
06:55.740 - 07:00.980:  You could say the good news is Vladimir Putin has said it's wrong for his country to invade another.
07:00.980 - 07:06.500:  The bad news he wasn't talking about Ukraine. I mean, it goes on, doesn't it? That quote you
07:06.500 - 07:11.200:  mentioned about not doing anything in foreign policy that contradicts the interests of other
07:11.200 - 07:16.100:  peoples. You can almost hear the cries of outrage from Ukrainians wondering whether their people
07:16.100 - 07:21.100:  might be included in this. So what's going on? Well, you know, as often with criminal
07:21.100 - 07:25.940:  analogy, we're speculating one possibility, Vladimir Putin has experienced some kind of
07:25.940 - 07:30.880:  damecy in conversion. He realizes it's not very nice to go around trying to conquer your neighbors
07:31.340 - 07:35.800:  from now on. It's going to be President Nice Guy. Andrew, I'm going to stick my neck out here
07:35.800 - 07:41.940:  and I'm going to say I don't think that's what's happening. Here's a guess. Slovakia has an
07:41.940 - 07:46.180:  election at the end of this month. Slovakia being, as I said, the successor country or one of
07:46.180 - 07:51.800:  the successor countries to Czechoslovakia. Until now, Slovakia has been very supportive of Ukraine
07:51.800 - 07:58.000:  by some measure per capita, the most generous donor of military aid. The election may well see
07:58.000 - 08:03.660:  another party smear at winning. Now smear and its leader, Robert Fiko, are very pro-Russia. If they
08:03.660 - 08:08.880:  win, there will be a U-turn in Slovakia's policy, a real breach in the NATO alliance. But
08:09.500 - 08:14.460:  when people in Slovakia think about voting for a pro-Russian party, they may well still have the
08:14.460 - 08:19.720:  memory of that invasion in their minds. It's not so easy to put an ex on the ballot paper. Unless,
08:19.720 - 08:24.620:  of course, Vladimir Putin tries to say, look, we're a different people now. I'm nothing to do with
08:24.620 - 08:30.060:  that awful invasion terribly sorry about it. And also, remember Hungary has a pro-Russian leader
08:30.060 - 08:36.120:  in the shape of Viktor Orban. So again, by Vladimir Putin distancing himself from the invasion of
08:36.120 - 08:41.420:  Hungary, he makes pro-Russian rulers have an easier time in their countries. We're led to believe
08:41.420 - 08:45.540:  through this speech that he's terribly sorry. That was the Soviet Union and of course,
08:45.540 - 08:50.960:  Vladimir Putin was a lifelong KGB member. We know that, but now he's saying, nothing to do with me.
08:51.340 - 08:57.160:  Hi, you're a regional editor, Paul Moss. It was Morocco's deadliest earthquake in more than six
08:57.160 - 09:03.520:  decades. The 6.8 magnitude disaster struck southwest of Marrakesh late on Friday. Now rescue
09:03.520 - 09:07.840:  workers reaching remote villages are talking about finding communities who feel forgotten
09:07.840 - 09:13.360:  and survivors who've heard calls from under the rubble that then fell silent. Our correspondent,
09:13.360 - 09:17.500:  Tom Bateman, sent us this report from the Atlas Mountain south of Marrakesh.
09:19.120 - 09:24.700:  A single pickaxe is slogged against the ground that swallowed up the heart of this village.
09:25.600 - 09:32.360:  In Mule Brachim, nearly everyone is homeless, but few have lost as much as Lassan,
09:32.920 - 09:37.780:  whose wife and four children were sleeping when their home fell.
09:37.900 - 09:48.580:  I came back from work around 11 and they told me my house had collapsed. I knew because that's
09:48.580 - 09:55.120:  the time my kids are asleep. Lassan tells me. So how do you feel now looking at the destruction here,
09:55.120 - 10:02.800:  what was your home? I need to be patient because there's nothing here I can do. God gave them
10:02.800 - 10:11.580:  and God takes them away, he says. Lassan is brought back to the remains of his home by his nephew,
10:11.580 - 10:20.140:  Hassan. He comforts his uncle, his wife and children have died. But nobody knows when help in the form
10:20.140 - 10:25.820:  of heavy machines will make their way up this hillside and start to clear all the wreckage.
10:26.500 - 10:32.540:  A community waits for answers that don't come. Well we've come to the center of this village and
10:32.560 - 10:37.600:  some of the things have burst into life. There's dozens of people surrounding the mosque
10:38.700 - 10:46.400:  which is serving as a hub to hand out food. What we've come to now is to be a morning tent.
10:47.660 - 10:53.060:  There are women inside, one woman in black looking extremely distraught and there's a line
10:54.560 - 11:01.180:  of neighbours and relatives who've come to greet her, bending over and embracing her.
11:03.460 - 11:09.600:  We drive the roads further into the mountains. Some are still blocked leaving villages inaccessible,
11:10.260 - 11:16.860:  but then we come to Orre Gan. At least the diggers are here and a helicopter hovers.
11:17.900 - 11:25.480:  Hadija sits and waits. Her brother Rashid was killed when the quake struck and now his home is
11:25.480 - 11:31.600:  smashed and tilted over. It's opened carcass streaming against electricity lines.
11:36.020 - 11:41.700:  My sister-in-law and her 15-year-old daughter are still missing inside says Hadija.
11:43.180 - 11:47.120:  What did you think when you saw your house here? I mean it's off-collapsed.
11:49.640 - 11:54.400:  The houses are a sense of belonging to this place. I lost all my neighbours here.
11:54.520 - 11:58.900:  16 people have been lost on this street says Hadija.
12:00.600 - 12:06.680:  The rescuers are on the rubble as the diggers giant arm heaves and claws at Rashid's home.
12:07.760 - 12:14.720:  And then there is silence. As we wait, the men bring 15-year-old Hadija from the ruins. Her
12:14.720 - 12:22.140:  body wrapped in a blanket before she will soon be taken and buried. The residents fall quiet
12:22.920 - 12:26.820:  and the land claims another child of their village.
12:28.760 - 12:34.480:  Tom Bateman, one of our BBC team in Morocco. A first truckload of humanitarian aid has crossed
12:34.480 - 12:39.940:  into the blockaded territory of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan. A Russian red cross truck was
12:39.940 - 12:44.160:  allowed through a checkpoint controlled by Russian peacekeepers. Here's Rey and Amitri.
12:44.640 - 12:49.900:  Russian peacekeepers controlling a checkpoint allowed a single truck loaded with food aid from
12:49.900 - 12:56.260:  Azerbaijan to enter the ethnic Armenian populated city of Stepanakert in Nagorno-Karabakh.
12:56.660 - 13:03.420:  Azerbaijan media provided live coverage describing it as a historic first step towards reintegration
13:03.420 - 13:09.600:  of Karabakh Armenians into Azerbaijan. The remote mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh,
13:09.900 - 13:16.160:  which is home to 120,000 ethnic Armenians, has been cut off from the outside world for
13:16.160 - 13:22.560:  over nine months after Azerbaijan blocked the only road connecting the enclave with the Republic
13:22.560 - 13:29.180:  of Armenia. Astronomers have hailed a fundamental breakthrough in the search for alien life after
13:29.180 - 13:34.960:  detecting signs on a distant planet of a gas that here on Earth is produced only by living organisms.
13:35.760 - 13:39.620:  If confirmed, this will propel the planet to the top of the list alongside Mars and the moons
13:39.620 - 13:45.620:  of Jupiter and Saturn of the best places to search for life. Professor Niku Madu Sudan from the
13:45.620 - 13:50.340:  University of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy made the discovery. In this particular case,
13:50.340 - 13:56.300:  the chemical composition of the atmosphere is telling us that it has the potential to have
13:56.300 - 14:02.540:  a surface ocean in it, like planet-wide ocean, underneath a thin hydrogen-rich atmosphere.
14:03.120 - 14:07.820:  Now, these are the kinds of planets which we have previously labeled as Haitian worlds,
14:08.380 - 14:12.560:  and these are some of the best places in search for life elsewhere.
14:13.280 - 14:16.300:  How exciting and discovery is this? Here's our science correspondent,
14:16.300 - 14:24.620:  Palavgosh. This has been an incredible discovery. This is a planet where the Hubble Space Telescope,
14:24.620 - 14:30.640:  which is incredibly powerful, has sampled what's in the atmosphere of planets so far away.
14:31.400 - 14:37.080:  And for the first time, what the astronomers have been able to find out is that that atmosphere
14:37.520 - 14:43.020:  contains some of the ingredients necessary for life. So carbon dioxide and methane,
14:43.100 - 14:49.660:  it's the first time that those chemicals have been discovered in the atmosphere of a far away
14:50.240 - 14:55.960:  world around another star, they're in the proportions that suggest that there might be a
14:55.960 - 15:03.060:  water ocean down on the surface. And then this chemical, called DMS-dimethylsulfide,
15:03.820 - 15:09.960:  is they haven't confirmed its existence, but if they do, then that they think could only have
15:09.960 - 15:14.880:  been produced by living organisms, which would be huge if confirmed. Of course, but
15:15.100 - 15:18.180:  confirming anything is presumably almost impossible and it's so far away.
15:18.660 - 15:25.040:  Well, no, nothing possible. They've confirmed effectively there's methane and carbon dioxide there,
15:25.440 - 15:31.240:  and next year there will no one way or another, whether there's this chemical called DMS
15:32.000 - 15:36.900:  in the atmosphere, and if they do confirm it, it'll be one of the biggest stories I've reported
15:36.900 - 15:40.360:  in my entire life. Our science correspondent, Palab Gosh.
15:42.520 - 15:47.740:  Coming up on this podcast, a study of female surgeons in the UK finds they're being sexually
15:47.740 - 15:53.860:  harassed and assaulted. I was assisting a consultant on a case, turned around and just buried his
15:53.860 - 15:58.240:  head right into my breasts, and I realised he was wiping his brow on me.
16:01.340 - 16:07.180:  Heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires, catastrophic consequences from climate change.
16:07.180 - 16:12.100:  What's going on is this real. The climate question is the podcast exploring our planet's
16:12.100 - 16:16.380:  changing environment and what we're doing across the world to adapt and respond to it.
16:16.380 - 16:20.780:  The future is ahead of us, a very sensitive to the choices that we make today.
16:20.880 - 16:23.440:  If we don't start fixing it, we're going to move victims of it.
16:23.500 - 16:24.320:  Get engaged.

16:38.840 - 16:44.020:  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising
16:44.020 - 16:49.200:  their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
16:49.480 - 16:54.500:  That's right, we're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

17:08.640 - 17:12.940:  As you may have heard in our last podcast, reports from Libya suggest the flooding in the east
17:12.940 - 17:17.580:  of the country has been severe with many lives lost. It's difficult to know exactly what is
17:17.580 - 17:22.800:  happening, as very few journalists are able to operate in Libya. And since the 2011 uprising
17:22.800 - 17:27.500:  that toppled the country's longtime ruler, Colonel Gaddafi, Libya has lacked a proper government.
17:27.500 - 17:30.800:  Our correspondent Anna Foster is just back from the Middle East.
17:31.100 - 17:36.320:  Well, what we're seeing at the moment on social media in particular is a huge volume of pictures
17:36.320 - 17:42.100:  and videos purporting to show this huge flooding. So example, is the town of Dernar,
17:42.560 - 17:47.920:  where it looks like a dam has burst or several dams have burst and washed away a huge number
17:47.920 - 17:53.840:  of buildings, which we believe could have resulted in potentially many thousands of deaths.
17:53.840 - 17:59.440:  Now, you'll notice I keep saying we believe it looks like because it's so hard to know for sure.
17:59.440 - 18:03.640:  And what you were saying there about the political situation is particularly important when it comes
18:03.640 - 18:09.980:  to a story like this, because in most other countries where we quote numbers and figures from
18:09.980 - 18:15.560:  the authorities, there tends to just be one set of authorities who we take as a trusted source.
18:15.560 - 18:21.160:  But obviously in Libya, there are two rival governments in the east and west of the country.
18:21.160 - 18:25.480:  So what we have to do with this story in particular is a lot more of our own
18:25.480 - 18:31.800:  verification speaking to people on the ground and not just taking on face value, some of the figures
18:31.800 - 18:35.820:  that were being shown. But what it is looking like at the moment is that there could have been a
18:35.820 - 18:39.640:  catastrophic loss of life in Libya because of this storm.
18:39.740 - 18:44.520:  There seems to be a little doubt from all of the sources that we have that we're talking about
18:44.520 - 18:47.980:  a lot of people having lost their lives. Well, that's at the heart of all of this. I mean,
18:47.980 - 18:53.200:  everybody that I've been speaking to this morning has been talking about thousands. Now,
18:53.200 - 18:58.980:  I've heard numbers from different sources ranging from 2000 to 10,000 in some cases. But that is,
18:59.140 - 19:05.120:  you know, could well be conjecture that the 2000 figure came from the leader of the eastern
19:05.120 - 19:09.920:  base authority. Now, that is the one that is not recognized by the international community,
19:09.920 - 19:14.980:  the one that was put in place by the House of Representatives in the east. He said 2000 and those
19:14.980 - 19:21.080:  numbers are rising. Again, because of the political implications, it's hard to know for sure. But
19:21.200 - 19:26.780:  as you say, it looks like this could have been a catastrophic event involving many thousands of
19:26.780 - 19:32.280:  people in those coastal areas of eastern Libya. Now, correspondent Anna Foster, for the first time
19:32.280 - 19:38.080:  in its history, all 15 justices have convened at Israel's Supreme Court for a hearing that will
19:38.080 - 19:42.220:  determine their own fate and future. There have been months of protests against the Israeli
19:42.220 - 19:47.040:  government's proposals to overhaul the judicial system. They would restrict judges' power to block
19:47.040 - 19:52.440:  government actions. Critics say the change would weaken judicial independence. Our correspondent,
19:52.440 - 19:58.260:  Yola Nell, is in Jerusalem. She described the scene outside the court. Only a small number of
19:58.260 - 20:03.440:  those people in support of the Hardline government's judicial overhaul outside the Supreme Court
20:03.440 - 20:08.720:  today. The bigger demonstration, actually many thousands of people, when I was outside the court
20:08.720 - 20:14.860:  last night, they unfilled this huge banner that said the court is supreme. They were waving
20:14.860 - 20:19.980:  their blue and white flags to show their support of the court. One man told me, our message is
20:19.980 - 20:26.480:  don't let it be intimidated by extremists. Now, the drama has really switched to the unprecedented
20:26.480 - 20:32.060:  showdown that is going on, pitching the most religious and nationalist government in Israel's history
20:32.060 - 20:38.740:  against its top judges inside the court, this crucial hearing. I'm just looking at the TV
20:38.740 - 20:44.280:  pictures from inside the hearing as the justices, well, it looks like having caught a heated
20:44.280 - 20:48.360:  conversation with the lawyers as they sit there in front of a number of Israeli flags. Tell me
20:48.360 - 20:52.200:  a bit about the arguments that are being made today. Yeah, so you've got the petitioners
20:52.900 - 20:56.860:  against the legal changes that were made by the government, putting it their case. And you've
20:56.860 - 21:01.820:  also got the government itself putting its case. Just to remind people, this case specifically
21:01.820 - 21:08.140:  goes back to a legal change that was made by the government in July. And it basically cancelled
21:08.140 - 21:13.960:  the ability of courts in Israel to block government actions using a legal standard that they were
21:14.280 - 21:21.840:  unreasonable. And those who against these dramatic changes to the justice system that being made
21:21.840 - 21:27.360:  by the government, the critics say that this is weakening the independence of the courts, it weakens
21:27.360 - 21:32.660:  democracy. But then you have the supporters of the overhaul who argue that actually democracy is
21:32.660 - 21:37.620:  being strengthened by all of this. And they argue that in recent years the court has become too
21:37.620 - 21:43.200:  interventionist as they term it, saying that it overturns too easily decisions that are being
21:43.200 - 21:49.740:  made by an elected government. So that's the background to all of this. Yes, inside the court,
21:49.740 - 21:56.340:  it has been pretty heated at times. We have heard the Supreme Court justice saying to
21:57.000 - 22:02.840:  members of the government that the justice minister who's there, that who is going to be
22:02.860 - 22:08.280:  deciding now that ministers are acting reasonably. Do you agree that there is law but no judge,
22:08.280 - 22:13.960:  which is what the Attorney General who is disliked by many members of the government has said,
22:13.960 - 22:18.580:  at the same time that the law and justice committee chairman was saying that people are sovereign,
22:18.580 - 22:23.060:  don't try to take democracy away from the Israeli people. I'm at least correspondent Yola
22:23.060 - 22:28.800:  Nell with me from Jerusalem. In the UK, the National Health Service offers free healthcare to
22:28.800 - 22:33.400:  everyone. It's seen as one of the pillars of the British state. But the news today suggests it
22:33.400 - 22:38.680:  might be about to have its own me too moment. Two reports have come out alleging serious problems
22:38.680 - 22:44.280:  with the treatment of female surgeons by male colleagues, often the senior person on whose training
22:44.280 - 22:49.700:  they depend. Our health correspondent is James Gallagher. This is a sensitive subject that is
22:50.060 - 22:55.140:  rarely discussed openly, but this behaviour it's worth remembering is happening now in NHS
22:55.140 - 23:00.860:  hospitals and we're talking about female surgeons being grouped inside their scrubs, being offered
23:00.860 - 23:08.460:  career opportunities for sex and in rare cases even being raped. Now this analysis is the first
23:08.460 - 23:13.460:  real attempt to attempt to look at the scale of the problem was conducted by the University of
23:13.460 - 23:19.220:  Exeter, the University of Surrey and the working party on sexual misconduct in surgery. So registered
23:19.220 - 23:25.880:  surgeons were invited to share their experiences across just the past five years, 700 women and
23:25.880 - 23:31.460:  700 men chose to respond. And the report concludes that many women surgeons are living a different
23:31.460 - 23:36.760:  reality because nearly two thirds of women said they'd been the target of sexual harassment and
23:36.760 - 23:42.280:  a third have been sexually assaulted by their colleagues. Now I spoke to Judith who's now a
23:42.280 - 23:47.360:  consultant but she was sexually assaulted when she was just a junior surgeon and this took place
23:47.720 - 23:53.580:  in an operating theatre full of other staff while a patient was anesthetised on the table.
23:54.520 - 24:00.880:  I was assisting a consultant on a case. I guess he'd got a bit sweaty but turned around and just
24:01.040 - 24:07.800:  buried his head right into my breasts and I realised he was wiping his brow on me and you just
24:07.800 - 24:13.700:  freeze right? Why is his face in my cleavage? And then a little while later he turns around and he
24:13.700 - 24:19.340:  does exactly the same thing all over again. So I said excuse me do you want me to get your towel
24:20.300 - 24:26.220:  and he said no this is much more fun and it was the smirk and everything about it I felt
24:26.920 - 24:33.440:  dirty, I felt humiliated. The reports highlight a lack of faith in the NHS, another major
24:33.440 - 24:38.200:  organisation to tackle the problem. It says the most common scenario here is for female trainees
24:38.200 - 24:43.800:  to be abused by senior male surgeons who are often their supervisor and I've spoken to women
24:43.800 - 24:49.720:  who say the expectation on them is that you just put up with whatever is done to you and that creates
24:49.720 - 24:54.140:  a real culture of silence in the profession where people are left in real fear of their careers
24:54.140 - 24:59.580:  if they do speak up and report it. So the reports author say that's what needs to change and there
24:59.580 - 25:04.180:  needs to be a major change in how such incidents are investigated so that they're outside the
25:04.180 - 25:10.380:  sphere of influence of senior surgeons and to make the process completely external and independent.
25:10.920 - 25:16.300:  So those who are on the receiving end of sexual abuse and harassment can trust that they will
25:16.300 - 25:20.820:  be investigated properly and I will say that there's already been a powerful reaction to these
25:20.820 - 25:26.540:  reports this morning, NHS England saying they make for incredibly difficult reading and were a
25:27.360 - 25:31.340:  evidence that more action needed to be taken. The General Medical Council saying that such
25:31.340 - 25:35.940:  seriousness, Condra was incompatible with staying on the UK's medical register.
25:36.340 - 25:41.360:  Hi, health correspondent James Gallagher reporting. Finally to a small hilly town in the centre
25:41.360 - 25:46.280:  of Portugal where there's been a surprise flash flood, right? Your right has the story.
25:52.840 - 25:59.120:  That is the sound of a video taken by a Portuguese man on his mobile phone of a river of red wine
25:59.120 - 26:05.000:  flowing down a steep street in his small town in the centre of the country. The streets were
26:05.000 - 26:10.920:  impossible, replaced by a raging river after two tanks burst in the local distillery,
26:10.920 - 26:17.940:  spewing 2.2 million litres of red wine into the hilly town of Sao Lorenzo de Barro,
26:18.060 - 26:24.000:  enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Local officials set off an environmental alert
26:24.000 - 26:30.360:  and firefighters rushed to help divert the tsunami of wine to prevent it from contaminating a
26:30.360 - 26:36.860:  nearby river, the Centima, which feeds into Portugal's largest freshwater lake and supports a
26:36.860 - 26:42.960:  network of wetland habitats, reed beds and marshlands. Luckily much of the wine ended up in
26:42.960 - 26:49.160:  local fields, there were no reports of any red wine-related injuries. The leaked alcohol
26:49.160 - 26:54.540:  reportedly flooded a basement at a home near the distillery from which it came, which
26:54.540 - 26:59.960:  apologized for the incident and said it would handle clean-up, repair and damage and investigate
26:59.960 - 27:05.760:  the cause. The distillery specialises in transforming wine into a slew of products,
27:05.760 - 27:12.260:  including gin, cleaning supplies and food oils. The distillery says the wine was essentially going
27:12.260 - 27:18.300:  to be destroyed or distilled into raw alcohol, as part of the Portuguese government's attempts to
27:18.300 - 27:24.740:  address a brewing wine crisis. Portugal has the world's highest wine consumption per capita
27:25.240 - 27:30.040:  and is among the European countries grappling with a massive surplus of wine this year.
27:30.680 - 27:35.900:  The combination of rising production costs and an ever-increasing range of alcoholic drinks
27:35.900 - 27:42.360:  has resulted in plummeting demand for wine in Europe. Videos of the wine river have circulated
27:42.360 - 27:47.340:  widely on social media, with many people arguing that the worst thing about the spill
27:47.340 - 27:52.200:  was the amount of wine that no one drank. Rachel Ritreporting
27:53.700 - 27:57.500:  That's all from us for now. Before we go though, you know we love hearing about what you do

28:10.920 - 28:16.460:  We are bouncing up and down on the rebound, the lifting weights and doing that sort of thing
28:16.460 - 28:21.000:  just to keep ourselves generally fit. Well, I'm telling you the international news in the background.
28:21.000 - 28:26.660:  Exactly. You'll hear more from Roger in this weekend's happy pod, but we love you to let us know
