*01:05.200- 01:07.400* :  Hmm, car prices haven't gone up in a couple weeks.

*01:19.160- 01:23.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.460- 01:28.260* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson, and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:28.260- 01:31.640* :  the 26th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:32.180- 01:35.160* :  There are growing humanitarian concerns as the ongoing
*01:35.160- 01:38.400* :  accidents of ethnic Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh
*01:38.760- 01:39.600* :  causes chaos.
*01:40.400- 01:43.660* :  Keeve claims the admiral in charge of Russia's black sea fleet
*01:44.020- 01:47.700* :  died following Ukraine's recent attacks in occupied Crimea.
*01:48.540- 01:48.800* :  Also.
*01:49.180- 01:49.820* :  It's a windfall.
*01:50.040- 01:50.860* :  It's on an island.
*01:50.860- 01:53.080* :  It's money that they've got by accident.
*01:53.200- 01:57.460* :  And of course, it adds up to at least a trillion in windfall profits.
*01:58.180- 02:00.120* :  Gordon Brown, the former British Prime Minister,
*02:00.120- 02:03.640* :  wants all rich nations to pay a windfall tax
*02:04.080- 02:07.500* :  to fund the climate change needs of developing nations.
*02:10.600- 02:13.160* :  Also in this podcast, we get a rare glimpse
*02:13.200- 02:15.020* :  at what's thought to be the biggest,
*02:15.020- 02:17.560* :  contemporary piece of art in the world
*02:18.220- 02:19.020* :  in the Nevada desert.
*02:19.640- 02:22.380* :  If someone said it's something that aliens created,
*02:22.380- 02:24.560* :  you'd be like, yes, I see that, that makes sense.
*02:25.160- 02:27.320* :  Or if they said it was like an ancient civilization
*02:27.520- 02:30.300* :  that created it, you'd be like, yeah, that makes sense.
*02:31.200- 02:34.100* :  And could scientists have cracked a perennial problem?
*02:34.500- 02:37.620* :  How do you get rid of spelling garlic breath?
*02:41.820- 02:43.860* :  We start in Nagorno-Karabakh where
*02:43.860- 02:46.160* :  Mundi saw scenes of panic and confusion
*02:46.160- 02:49.840* :  as more ethnic Armenians tried to flee the disputed territory,
*02:49.840- 02:53.160* :  which Azerbaijan forces seized control of last week.
*02:53.800- 02:57.020* :  Long lines of traffic continued to clog the road to Armenia
*02:57.520- 03:00.220* :  and there were chaotic scenes at a registration point
*03:00.620- 03:01.740* :  just across the border.
*03:02.500- 03:04.760* :  Azerbaijan's President Ilam Aliyev promised
*03:04.760- 03:08.080* :  that the rights of Karabakh Armenians would be guaranteed,
*03:08.080- 03:10.400* :  but many don't believe the assurances.
*03:10.960- 03:13.100* :  The Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan
*03:13.100- 03:16.600* :  shared his concerns about the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*03:17.060- 03:20.780* :  The ethnic cleansing of Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh
*03:21.040- 03:24.200* :  is underway, so that's happening just now
*03:24.640- 03:27.060* :  and that it's a very unfortunate fact
*03:27.140- 03:31.440* :  because we were trying to urge international community on that.
*03:32.260- 03:34.560* :  The international red cross is stepping up efforts
*03:34.560- 03:37.380* :  to cope with the exodus of people from the territory,
*03:37.900- 03:41.120* :  which is at the heart of one of the world's longest-running conflicts.
*03:41.460- 03:45.220* :  An explosion at a petrol station in the main city of Stepanakert
*03:45.220- 03:48.260* :  is reported of injured around 200 people,
*03:48.260- 03:50.700* :  many of whom were said to have suffered severe burns.
*03:50.900- 03:54.620* :  The Armenian spokeswoman for the International Red Cross, Zara Amatuni,
*03:54.960- 03:57.680* :  says a humanitarian operation is underway
*03:58.140- 03:59.520* :  to help displaced people.
*04:00.000- 04:03.340* :  We're actually trying to release step up our sources
*04:03.860- 04:05.560* :  and give up the scale of the humanitarian needs
*04:05.760- 04:08.220* :  to increase our presence in the region by adding personnel,
*04:08.220- 04:10.060* :  for example, specializing in health,
*04:10.380- 04:13.980* :  forensics, production issues, and weapon contamination among others,
*04:14.480- 04:16.820* :  but also we're trying to monitor and ensure
*04:17.380- 04:19.540* :  the protection of people that are left behind.
*04:20.020- 04:22.300* :  Ben Thomson spoke to Gabriel Gavin,
*04:22.300- 04:26.280* :  a political journalist on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
*04:26.880- 04:31.380* :  I've spent today seeing thousands of people coming in from Nagorno-Karabakh,
*04:31.640- 04:33.280* :  people have piled up their possessions,
*04:33.280- 04:36.060* :  pie in their cars, put whatever little they could get together
*04:36.060- 04:37.100* :  in the back of vans,
*04:37.420- 04:39.940* :  or are riding quite literally in the open backs
*04:39.940- 04:42.360* :  of farm yard vehicles and construction vehicles,
*04:42.820- 04:44.780* :  just doing whatever they can to get out.
*04:45.240- 04:46.800* :  And once they've arrived in Armenia,
*04:46.800- 04:50.180* :  there's been scenes of chaos at a Red Cross evacuation point
*04:50.180- 04:50.980* :  on the border.
*04:51.220- 04:53.640* :  How it went out earlier today in a heavy storm,
*04:53.980- 04:55.380* :  the ground turned to mud.
*04:55.380- 04:58.980* :  Effectively, people have been more or less left with nothing.
*04:58.980- 05:02.320* :  The people I speak to absolutely have no certainty
*05:02.320- 05:03.380* :  about what comes next.
*05:03.680- 05:05.480* :  The only thing they do consistently tell me
*05:05.800- 05:07.680* :  is they fear they will never return home.
*05:08.100- 05:11.060* :  And they've left not just their houses and their apartments and their flats,
*05:11.160- 05:13.720* :  but they've left often their livelihoods behind,
*05:13.720- 05:15.760* :  farms, factories, machinery,
*05:15.980- 05:17.860* :  things that they know that they'll never be able to get back.
*05:18.480- 05:22.600* :  You touched there on some of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding.
*05:23.340- 05:25.460* :  What is your assessment from what you've seen?
*05:25.460- 05:28.160* :  What help is needed for people who are fleeing?
*05:28.560- 05:31.420* :  Well, I think the ICRC has done an incredible job
*05:31.740- 05:34.580* :  meeting with people, ensuring that they're getting the support they need
*05:34.580- 05:36.000* :  in terms of food, blankets.
*05:36.520- 05:38.900* :  The Armenian government is providing them with hotel rooms,
*05:38.920- 05:41.880* :  but ordinary Armenians are just pitching in to pick people up,
*05:42.140- 05:43.520* :  drop them at wherever they need to go,
*05:44.120- 05:45.860* :  sharing sofas and lifts,
*05:45.860- 05:47.340* :  and whatever else they can do.
*05:47.600- 05:48.620* :  But the real question is,
*05:48.620- 05:52.760* :  in a country that seems to be just a hair away from an all-out conflict,
*05:52.760- 05:54.160* :  once again, with Azerbaijan.
*05:54.720- 05:56.860* :  How are they going to rehouse these people in the long term?
*05:56.860- 05:58.420* :  What jobs are they going to give people?
*05:58.800- 06:00.840* :  What education opportunities are they going to be able
*06:01.080- 06:02.640* :  to be able to offer for their children?
*06:03.160- 06:05.780* :  And people who've lived through three wars effectively
*06:05.820- 06:07.380* :  are in a very short space of time.
*06:07.380- 06:10.340* :  How are they going to have their mental health needs met?
*06:10.560- 06:12.900* :  And as a result, you see people just milling around
*06:12.900- 06:15.580* :  in the central to city with no one seemingly there to help them.
*06:15.820- 06:17.960* :  Some of the scenes that we've had from the hotels here
*06:18.360- 06:19.200* :  are just horrific.
*06:19.200- 06:21.100* :  People sitting with their head in their hands.
*06:21.380- 06:26.380* :  I met an elderly deaf couple who just simply couldn't comprehend what was going on.
*06:26.580- 06:29.660* :  They'd left the place they'd called home for their entire lives,
*06:30.000- 06:31.660* :  and in a picture of absolute chaos.
*06:32.260- 06:34.660* :  Whilst that humanitarian crisis is unfolding,
*06:34.660- 06:37.680* :  there is concerns that fighting between the Armenians
*06:37.680- 06:40.400* :  and the Azerbaijanis may not yet be over,
*06:40.400- 06:41.760* :  and that is why people are fleeing.
*06:42.060- 06:44.940* :  The real reason that I think most people have decided to flee
*06:44.940- 06:46.880* :  is because they're not worried so much about the fighting,
*06:46.880- 06:48.420* :  they're worried about what comes next.
*06:48.820- 06:51.300* :  As of the genre I spoke to President Ilham Ali
*06:51.300- 06:53.460* :  of Foreign Policy Advisor today,
*06:53.940- 06:55.840* :  he absolutely assures the international community
*06:56.380- 06:58.340* :  that ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh
*06:58.340- 06:59.980* :  are going to have their rights respected.
*07:00.360- 07:02.360* :  But this is a country that for decades
*07:02.360- 07:06.540* :  has built a real ethnic animus against its ethnic Armenian population,
*07:06.580- 07:09.140* :  and we've seen in 2020 and 2016
*07:09.140- 07:12.460* :  a large number of atrocities, the headings, executions,
*07:12.820- 07:14.820* :  and that looms large in the minds of people.
*07:14.820- 07:17.000* :  They simply do not believe that they will be safe,
*07:17.500- 07:19.140* :  and it's now the job of Azerbaijan
*07:19.140- 07:22.340* :  if it wants to prevent a mass exodus to convince them that actually
*07:22.340- 07:25.020* :  that isn't the case and that it will stand up for their rights.
*07:25.440- 07:27.120* :  So far, even with just a few days
*07:27.360- 07:29.060* :  out of having seen really fierce fights,
*07:29.060- 07:30.480* :  being artillery barrage,
*07:30.960- 07:33.180* :  it's very, very unclear that they intend to do that,
*07:33.400- 07:36.160* :  and they can rebuild that bridge with the ethnic Armenian population
*07:36.260- 07:38.700* :  as a result of a lot of fleeing for their lives.
*07:39.140- 07:41.780* :  Gabriel Gavin speaking there to Ben Thompson.
*07:42.460- 07:46.500* :  Ukraine's special forces say 34 Russian officers were killed
*07:46.500- 07:48.880* :  in a missile attack on the Navy's headquarters
*07:48.880- 07:50.920* :  and occupied Crimea on Friday.
*07:51.480- 07:53.460* :  They say the commander of the Black Sea Fleet
*07:53.460- 07:54.740* :  was among those who died.
*07:55.240- 07:58.380* :  Russia said at the time only that one serviceman was missing.
*07:59.060- 08:01.500* :  James Waterhouse is our correspondent in Kiev
*08:01.900- 08:02.880* :  and gave me his reaction.
*08:03.400- 08:05.020* :  If these claims are true,
*08:05.320- 08:09.740* :  then it would amount to a sizeable blow for Russia
*08:09.740- 08:11.140* :  in terms of its command structure,
*08:11.240- 08:12.560* :  because we're talking about a military
*08:12.880- 08:15.720* :  that has a very old-fashioned command structure,
*08:15.720- 08:18.080* :  where it is only the most senior officers
*08:18.300- 08:19.740* :  who can issue orders,
*08:20.200- 08:22.440* :  and officers have to be of a certain rank to interact
*08:22.440- 08:24.580* :  with admirals of that kind.
*08:24.800- 08:28.700* :  So it does stifle potentially Russian operations in this area,
*08:28.700- 08:32.180* :  but it would be surprising if the main command center
*08:32.180- 08:34.200* :  of Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine
*08:34.200- 08:35.620* :  would be in Sevastopol.
*08:35.900- 08:37.280* :  But it is significant in that.
*08:37.460- 08:40.460* :  The very least when we saw the dramatic images of Western missiles
*08:40.460- 08:43.600* :  landing on the Russian naval HQ in Sevastopol,
*08:43.780- 08:46.020* :  it was a symbolic moment for a few crane
*08:46.020- 08:47.640* :  in terms of undermining Russia's presence,
*08:47.640- 08:48.980* :  but also for Russia itself,
*08:49.200- 08:50.880* :  because this is at the heart of its operation.
*08:50.980- 08:53.440* :  It's sort of the cornerstone of its invasion.
*08:53.720- 08:55.240* :  And the claim is, is that they took out
*08:55.460- 08:57.200* :  the commander of the Black Sea fleet,
*08:57.280- 09:00.560* :  a fleet of vessels that has been so dominant to date,
*09:01.100- 09:02.080* :  General Sakhalov.
*09:02.320- 09:04.140* :  But the problem here is that we have no proof.
*09:04.140- 09:06.440* :  No evidence has been provided with this statement,
*09:06.440- 09:08.920* :  but I think we are seeing Ukraine try to assert
*09:08.920- 09:11.560* :  that this was indeed more than a symbolic strike
*09:11.560- 09:12.640* :  that we saw last Friday.
*09:13.220- 09:16.020* :  And what about the UN Human Rights Report,
*09:16.940- 09:18.380* :  reporting continuing violations
*09:18.380- 09:20.780* :  by Russian forces in Ukraine?
*09:21.300- 09:23.520* :  How significant is it to think for Kiev
*09:23.520- 09:26.260* :  that there's backs out what they've been saying all along?
*09:26.740- 09:28.640* :  It's a huge moment for Kiev,
*09:28.640- 09:31.020* :  because Kiev has always been frustrated
*09:31.020- 09:33.840* :  with the lack of judicial proceedings,
*09:33.840- 09:35.800* :  shall we say, from the International Criminal Court.
*09:36.160- 09:38.560* :  So that is why you've seen Ukrainian court,
*09:38.560- 09:41.500* :  its own judicial system pursue criminal proceedings
*09:41.500- 09:43.840* :  against the more junior Russian officers
*09:44.240- 09:47.240* :  who have been accused and even convicted of committing war crimes
*09:47.240- 09:48.500* :  in this full-scale invasion.
*09:48.880- 09:50.580* :  And so we have the Human Rights Report,
*09:50.580- 09:53.300* :  which acknowledges after investigation
*09:53.860- 09:55.580* :  of that Russian media, for example,
*09:55.580- 09:59.600* :  incited genocide by the way it State TV reports this war,
*10:00.240- 10:02.840* :  with the allegations that Russian soldiers
*10:02.840- 10:04.560* :  have targeted civilian infrastructure,
*10:04.600- 10:06.520* :  that they have murdered, that they have raped,
*10:06.520- 10:09.460* :  that they have tortured Ukrainians so severely,
*10:09.460- 10:11.560* :  that they have died as a result of their injuries.
*10:11.760- 10:13.640* :  On the ground, we have seen evidence of this.
*10:13.900- 10:16.900* :  The targeting of civilians, the deliberate targeting,
*10:16.900- 10:19.660* :  it is a core feature of Russia's invasion.
*10:20.020- 10:22.320* :  Thus far, there is only an arrest warrant out
*10:22.360- 10:24.520* :  for Vladimir Putin and one of his top officials
*10:25.120- 10:27.900* :  on the charge of abducting Ukrainian children.
*10:27.900- 10:31.240* :  But Ukraine will see this as a vital body of evidence
*10:31.300- 10:33.620* :  that will add to the dossier, if you like,
*10:33.620- 10:35.780* :  around Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine.
*10:36.580- 10:38.360* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev.
*10:39.020- 10:40.660* :  Meanwhile, there are growing indications
*10:40.660- 10:43.980* :  that Russian revenue from the sale of its oil is increasing.
*10:43.980- 10:45.940* :  Despite sanctions put in place
*10:45.940- 10:48.220* :  by the G7 group of advanced nations,
*10:48.820- 10:50.840* :  they have attempted to use their influence
*10:50.840- 10:53.300* :  in the shipping industry to restrict the amount
*10:53.300- 10:57.200* :  which Russia earns from its oil to $60 a barrel.
*10:57.920- 11:00.820* :  But Ukrainian economists say Russia is transporting its goods
*11:00.820- 11:02.300* :  without Western insurance,
*11:02.300- 11:05.440* :  and as the price of crude oil escalates.
*11:05.920- 11:07.960* :  Aren't diplomatic correspondent Pollard on the reports?
*11:08.480- 11:10.040* :  The rising price of crude oil,
*11:10.040- 11:12.280* :  now heading towards $100 a barrel,
*11:12.720- 11:15.580* :  is helping Moscow recoup some of the losses incurred
*11:15.800- 11:17.260* :  as a result of Western sanctions.
*11:18.020- 11:19.620* :  So is the fact that ships recruited
*11:19.620- 11:22.080* :  as part of Russia's so-called dark fleet
*11:22.520- 11:24.460* :  are more and more willing to turn to insurers
*11:24.460- 11:27.040* :  outside the traditional Western-based clubs.
*11:27.700- 11:30.840* :  Insurance was one of the levers that G7 countries assumed
*11:30.840- 11:34.240* :  would enable them to enforce a $60 a barrel price cap
*11:34.640- 11:36.800* :  imposed on Russian oil last December.
*11:37.500- 11:39.300* :  But research conducted by Ukraine's
*11:39.300- 11:42.480* :  key of School of Economics suggests that Russian oil revenues
*11:42.480- 11:46.100* :  this year are likely to be at least $15 billion higher
*11:46.100- 11:48.320* :  than envisaged under the price cap.
*11:49.000- 11:51.440* :  Sanctions on Russia are having a massive effect,
*11:51.440- 11:54.580* :  but Moscow is getting better and better at working around them.
*11:55.000- 11:56.720* :  Some of the ships carrying Russian oil
*11:56.720- 11:59.240* :  are willing to engage in highly irregular behavior,
*11:59.780- 12:02.520* :  from switching off their transponders to avoid being tracked,
*12:03.100- 12:04.740* :  to offloading their cargo's at sea
*12:04.740- 12:06.800* :  in so-called ship-to-ship transfers.
*12:07.820- 12:10.020* :  According to Michel Bachmann, a senior analyst
*12:10.020- 12:12.660* :  at Lloyd's List, two-thirds of the tankers
*12:12.660- 12:14.620* :  which shipped oil from Russia in August
*12:15.240- 12:17.420* :  were not in compliance with G7 sanctions.
*12:18.040- 12:18.600* :  Paul Adams.
*12:19.440- 12:21.300* :  The president of France, Emmanuel Macron,
*12:21.300- 12:24.440* :  has outlined how his country plans to meet the European
*12:24.440- 12:28.340* :  commitment of cutting harmful gas emissions by 2030.
*12:28.960- 12:33.240* :  The aim is to reduce them to 55% of where they stood in 1990.
*12:33.920- 12:35.940* :  Presenting the conclusions of a government commission
*12:35.940- 12:39.360* :  on ecology, Mr. Macron said that by 2027,
*12:39.380- 12:43.120* :  France would have closed its last coal-fired power stations
*12:43.520- 12:46.520* :  and be producing a million electric cars a year.
*12:47.000- 12:48.480* :  From Paris, here's Hussie Goffield.
*12:48.980- 12:50.660* :  France is a country with a strong tradition
*12:50.720- 12:51.820* :  of central planning.
*12:51.900- 12:54.100* :  There actually exists a branch of government
*12:54.100- 12:56.140* :  called the High Commission for the Plan.
*12:56.280- 12:57.960* :  And this report into how at the same time
*12:57.960- 13:00.360* :  to protect both the planet and the economy
*13:00.720- 13:01.820* :  bears the official title,
*13:02.040- 13:04.800* :  The Grand Plan for Ecological Planification.
*13:05.000- 13:05.780* :  It's no joke, though.
*13:05.780- 13:08.140* :  President Macron has been accused by green activists
*13:08.140- 13:10.780* :  of being old mouth and little action on the environment.
*13:10.780- 13:12.600* :  And this is his way of putting the challenge
*13:12.600- 13:14.500* :  of France's economic transformation
*13:14.960- 13:16.480* :  at the heart of his second mandate.
*13:16.760- 13:18.780* :  And in ecology, the need.
*13:18.780- 13:20.700* :  What we are planning is a middle course,
*13:21.060- 13:23.660* :  not a policy of denial, pretending there is no problem,
*13:24.060- 13:26.960* :  but not a policy of self-inflicted punishment either,
*13:27.440- 13:30.440* :  which would be impossible in our social and economic model.
*13:30.800- 13:32.760* :  What we seek is ecological sovereignty,
*13:33.100- 13:35.680* :  which would be reinforced by decarbonisation,
*13:35.820- 13:39.180* :  because that will let us reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
*13:39.240- 13:41.280* :  The president said the best policy was not simply
*13:41.280- 13:44.200* :  to ban things that pollute and then try to find a solution,
*13:44.300- 13:47.260* :  but to provide incentives for people to make the right choices.
*13:47.540- 13:50.580* :  So gas heaters in homes will not be outlawed
*13:50.580- 13:51.880* :  as environmentalists want.
*13:51.880- 13:53.800* :  Instead, there'll be a massive investment
*13:53.800- 13:55.680* :  in the production of heat pumps in France
*13:56.060- 13:57.740* :  in order to bring their price down.
*13:57.940- 13:59.360* :  There's to be a national program
*13:59.360- 14:01.440* :  for the cheap leasing of electric cars
*14:01.440- 14:04.180* :  and a billion trees planted by 2030.
*14:04.180- 14:06.520* :  At this stage, it is still all words,
*14:06.940- 14:08.700* :  but at least if French policy fails,
*14:08.700- 14:10.600* :  it won't be for want of planning.
*14:11.040- 14:13.700* :  Hughes Gofield and staying on the same theme,
*14:13.700- 14:15.980* :  Britain's former Prime Minister Gordon Brown
*14:15.980- 14:18.020* :  is calling for oil-producing countries
*14:18.020- 14:22.680* :  to pay a special levy to help poorer nations tackle climate change.
*14:23.160- 14:25.060* :  He says the rise in prices last year
*14:25.060- 14:29.040* :  created a lottery-style bananza for countries like Saudi Arabia
*14:29.440- 14:31.100* :  and the United Arab Emirates,
*14:31.360- 14:34.940* :  which is hosting the next UN Climate Summit COP28.
*14:35.740- 14:37.820* :  Mr. Brown, who's the United Nations envoy,
*14:37.820- 14:41.440* :  says a 3% levy on their export revenues
*14:41.440- 14:45.740* :  would provide $25 billion to fight global warming.
*14:46.180- 14:47.900* :  And he's been talking to Misha Hussein.
*14:48.380- 14:50.780* :  We're in an extraordinary and explosive situation.
*14:50.960- 14:53.300* :  You've got droughts, floods, firestorms,
*14:53.360- 14:55.040* :  all over the world without support
*14:55.040- 14:56.820* :  for the poorest countries to deal with them.
*14:57.240- 14:59.640* :  And you've got this extraordinary unprecedented,
*14:59.640- 15:02.420* :  the almost unthinkable windfall of revenues
*15:02.420- 15:04.520* :  that are pouring into the petro-states.
*15:04.680- 15:08.760* :  The biggest beneficiaries are Saudi and the UAE and Qatar
*15:08.760- 15:10.960* :  and Kuwait, as well as Norway.
*15:10.960- 15:14.580* :  And it's they that are causing the high prices in the South,
*15:14.860- 15:16.060* :  which are causing so much poverty.
*15:16.060- 15:18.020* :  So they've got a duty to do something about it.
*15:18.020- 15:20.960* :  The chairman of COP28 has said he wants people to put the money
*15:20.960- 15:22.820* :  on the table while it's up to them, first of all,
*15:22.820- 15:25.300* :  to put their money and the petro-states money on the table
*15:25.300- 15:26.520* :  so that we can get a settlement
*15:26.580- 15:28.600* :  that can pay for some of the reparation
*15:28.600- 15:31.080* :  that needs to be done to mitigate an effect climate change.
*15:31.200- 15:34.160* :  But historically, its countries like us,
*15:34.180- 15:35.780* :  isn't it, and the US and many others,
*15:35.780- 15:39.840* :  who have got rich over the generations through industrialization?
*15:40.240- 15:42.640* :  And that's a period at which global temperatures have risen.
*15:42.920- 15:46.140* :  That's why my proposal is that they provide the seed money
*15:46.300- 15:47.740* :  and that would be 25 billion,
*15:48.140- 15:50.100* :  that the Western countries that you're talking about
*15:50.100- 15:52.560* :  provide guarantees, perhaps up to 100 billion,
*15:52.900- 15:54.500* :  that we refinance the World Bank,
*15:54.500- 15:57.660* :  and enable it to put money into mitigation and adaptation,
*15:58.200- 16:00.980* :  to allow Africa, for example, to make the energy transition
*16:00.980- 16:03.260* :  to get out of coal, to invest in renewables,
*16:03.780- 16:07.840* :  to deal with the situation where Africa's got 50% of the adaptation bills,
*16:08.080- 16:10.840* :  but of course, it's been responsible for only 2% of the emissions.
*16:10.840- 16:14.140* :  So it's part of a bargain between the richest countries
*16:14.520- 16:15.900* :  based on their capacity to pay
*16:15.900- 16:17.440* :  and based on historic emissions.
*16:17.800- 16:19.140* :  Do you think there is any credibility
*16:19.240- 16:22.900* :  in the UN process taking place this time
*16:22.900- 16:24.720* :  in one of those petrodollar countries?
*16:25.040- 16:27.780* :  Well, that's to be proven, if the oil countries
*16:28.320- 16:31.100* :  and remember that the chairman of COP28 is ironically
*16:31.120- 16:33.560* :  at the head of one of the biggest oil companies in the world,
*16:33.880- 16:38.000* :  can't put up, we're talking about 4,000 billion of revenues
*16:38.000- 16:39.400* :  that have come from oil and gas,
*16:39.660- 16:42.640* :  a rise of 2.5 trillion over the last year.
*16:42.860- 16:45.140* :  And if they can't put up 1% of these revenues
*16:45.140- 16:47.120* :  or 3% of their export earnings
*16:47.600- 16:49.600* :  to help make possible climate change settlement,
*16:49.600- 16:52.300* :  then I do think that the COP28 process
*16:52.300- 16:54.140* :  will find itself in difficulty in the future.
*16:54.140- 16:56.020* :  And it really is up to those countries
*16:56.020- 16:58.920* :  that have got the capacity to pay to product the money now
*16:59.140- 17:00.760* :  and it would make a huge difference
*17:00.760- 17:03.140* :  to the ability of African and Asian countries
*17:03.340- 17:04.980* :  and, of course, the small island states
*17:05.360- 17:07.220* :  to deal with droughts, but also to deal with floods
*17:07.220- 17:08.940* :  and to deal with firestorms.
*17:09.360- 17:11.800* :  Britain's former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.
*17:14.300- 17:16.400* :  Still to calm on the Global News podcast,
*17:16.400- 17:18.560* :  the Hollywood star Tom Hanks
*17:18.880- 17:20.700* :  on his fascination with the moon.
*17:20.940- 17:23.740* :  You know what is going to be the next great moment
*17:23.740- 17:25.740* :  in human evolution,
*17:26.360- 17:30.440* :  when the first child is born on the moon.
*17:38.260- 17:40.600* :  A small river that runs through a poor community
*17:40.600- 17:43.540* :  in the Guatemalan capital has overflowed
*17:43.540- 17:45.020* :  after hours of heavy rain,
*17:45.020- 17:47.200* :  sweeping away several homes.
*17:47.760- 17:50.160* :  Six people have died, including young children
*17:50.580- 17:52.300* :  and at least 13 others are missing.
*17:52.720- 17:55.740* :  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Rosha reports.
*17:56.360- 17:58.460* :  Rescue teams and volunteers have been looking
*17:58.460- 18:00.760* :  in the mud since the early hours of Monday.
*18:01.280- 18:04.200* :  One of the bodies was found three kilometers downstream.
*18:05.000- 18:06.740* :  Residents say they heard a loud noise
*18:06.740- 18:09.540* :  in the middle of the night as the swollen river hit the area.
*18:09.800- 18:11.300* :  It all happened over quickly
*18:11.300- 18:13.040* :  and they had no time to escape.
*18:13.640- 18:15.340* :  The incident highlights the situation
*18:15.340- 18:17.520* :  of millions of people living in dangerous
*18:17.960- 18:20.280* :  and substandard conditions in Guatemala.
*18:20.860- 18:23.320* :  The community affected Dios Esfiel,
*18:23.960- 18:26.000* :  consists of dozens of precarious houses
*18:26.500- 18:28.140* :  built at the bottom of a gorge
*18:28.420- 18:31.500* :  under one of Guatemala's city's main access bridges.
*18:31.960- 18:32.760* :  El naranjo.
*18:33.140- 18:36.420* :  In order, Rosha, a gymnastics metal ceremony in Dublin
*18:36.420- 18:38.740* :  which has been watched millions of times
*18:38.740- 18:41.840* :  on social media has caused outrage around the world
*18:42.240- 18:45.220* :  and drawn the attention of one of the sports superstars,
*18:45.520- 18:46.400* :  Simone Biles.
*18:46.980- 18:49.220* :  Now, gymnastics island has issued
*18:49.220- 18:52.620* :  an unreserved apology to the family of a young black girl
*18:52.920- 18:55.180* :  who was in a line of children being awarded medals
*18:55.180- 18:56.660* :  when she was missed out.
*18:57.240- 18:59.160* :  Our sports correspondent Nesta McGregor
*18:59.160- 19:00.560* :  told me more about the video.
*19:00.900- 19:03.000* :  In the footage, we can see it's a gymnastics event.
*19:03.080- 19:05.040* :  It looks like a large profile one
*19:05.040- 19:07.620* :  because we have photographers, we have dignitaries
*19:08.080- 19:12.440* :  and we also have someone acting on behalf of gymnastics island
*19:12.940- 19:15.380* :  at the medal ceremony, placing medals
*19:15.380- 19:17.860* :  around the necks of those who compete in this.
*19:17.860- 19:20.900* :  Probably about 10 to 12 girls in the lineup.
*19:21.020- 19:23.380* :  She goes along the line and gives everyone a medal
*19:23.380- 19:27.060* :  except a young black girl who is seemingly ignored
*19:27.120- 19:29.460* :  because we don't actually know exactly why
*19:29.460- 19:30.480* :  she wasn't given a medal.
*19:30.940- 19:33.000* :  She just seems to almost miss her out
*19:33.360- 19:36.460* :  and gives the girls either side of her a medal.
*19:36.920- 19:38.780* :  Now, it's since transpired that the girls family
*19:38.780- 19:42.200* :  did make a formal complaint to gymnastics island at the time
*19:42.200- 19:44.820* :  and a resolution which, according to the federation,
*19:44.820- 19:48.460* :  pleased both parties was reached in August of this year.
*19:48.640- 19:49.580* :  Why did it take so long?
*19:49.800- 19:52.500* :  As we live in a social and digital age,
*19:52.500- 19:55.560* :  since March 2022, this video has been reposted
*19:55.560- 19:57.300* :  and shared millions of times now.
*19:57.340- 20:00.040* :  But it seems in recent weeks it's really accelerated
*20:00.040- 20:02.120* :  and the footage has reached celebrities,
*20:02.620- 20:04.160* :  including Simone Biles, who's, of course,
*20:04.160- 20:06.660* :  one of the most famous gymnasts in Best Gymnast ever
*20:06.660- 20:07.820* :  and was also a black woman.
*20:08.120- 20:09.900* :  Now, the American is a four-time Olympic champion
*20:09.900- 20:11.300* :  said the video broke her heart
*20:11.300- 20:14.100* :  and there was no room for racism in any sport.
*20:14.100- 20:17.120* :  She had previously sent the girl a message of support
*20:17.120- 20:18.880* :  after the initial incident took place.
*20:19.180- 20:20.500* :  And I guess to answer your question,
*20:20.940- 20:22.380* :  with the story back in the news,
*20:22.380- 20:24.180* :  gymnastics island probably had no choice.
*20:24.340- 20:26.500* :  But to release this new statement and today,
*20:26.500- 20:28.900* :  they issue what they call an unreserved apology
*20:28.900- 20:30.920* :  to the family of the young black gymnast
*20:30.960- 20:31.780* :  not given a medal.
*20:31.960- 20:33.920* :  The person involved we understand
*20:34.240- 20:38.960* :  did write a personal apology letter to the young gymnast
*20:39.200- 20:41.740* :  which the family of the gymnast say she never got.
*20:41.860- 20:43.140* :  I think what's interesting about this story
*20:43.140- 20:45.580* :  is that gymnastic island said they got someone independent
*20:45.580- 20:47.100* :  to come in and review the situation.
*20:47.180- 20:49.300* :  And as I mentioned before, an agreement had been reached
*20:49.300- 20:51.140* :  that both parties were happy with,
*20:51.220- 20:52.680* :  but clearly that wasn't the case
*20:52.680- 20:55.980* :  because it seems to me the family of this young girl,
*20:56.020- 20:58.720* :  they wanted a public acknowledgement of what had just happened
*20:58.720- 21:02.480* :  and what's interesting is that with Simone Biles on board,
*21:02.480- 21:04.560* :  this is as public as it could get.
*21:04.560- 21:07.660* :  And gymnastics is a sport as well that in recent years,
*21:07.660- 21:10.040* :  the image of it has been tarnished over the treatment
*21:10.040- 21:10.900* :  of young athletes.
*21:11.320- 21:13.900* :  So even though we are talking about an isolated incident,
*21:13.900- 21:16.840* :  this is still a sport that's trying to be more diverse
*21:16.840- 21:21.240* :  in both genders and race in the young athletes it attracts.
*21:21.240- 21:24.880* :  So any kind of PR like this will not be good for the sports.
*21:24.880- 21:27.920* :  So I think they had no choice but to address this publicly.
*21:28.400- 21:29.800* :  And if stories do have a happy ending,
*21:29.800- 21:31.120* :  it's worth saying that young black girl
*21:31.120- 21:32.920* :  who didn't get a medal did eventually get one.
*21:33.600- 21:34.400* :  Nester McGregor.
*21:35.100- 21:38.140* :  The Hollywood actor and two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks
*21:38.140- 21:41.120* :  has been speaking to the BBC about his latest project
*21:41.520- 21:45.140* :  narrating an immersive show in London called The Moonwalkers.
*21:45.600- 21:48.340* :  Co-written with space filmmaker Christopher Riley,
*21:48.820- 21:51.000* :  it uses NASA footage and astronauts
*21:51.000- 21:52.340* :  from the Artemis program.
*21:52.960- 21:55.060* :  The BBC's patio conel asked Tom Hanks
*21:55.320- 21:57.360* :  what sparked his interest in the mood.
*21:57.900- 22:01.700* :  When I was in school at my most malleable,
*22:01.700- 22:05.740* :  if I should say, from 64 to 1969,
*22:06.060- 22:10.280* :  five years of the space program.
*22:10.420- 22:11.260* :  Well, the space race.
*22:11.440- 22:14.600* :  That would be the first thing we learned about it.
*22:14.660- 22:17.280* :  The race to be the Soviets.
*22:17.280- 22:22.680* :  The Soviets were the bad guys in our world every single day.
*22:23.260- 22:25.000* :  Not only the nature of the prestige,
*22:25.000- 22:26.380* :  that was certainly part of it.
*22:26.460- 22:29.300* :  But just this mysterious bizarro people
*22:29.300- 22:34.000* :  on the other side of the world might do something before we did
*22:34.000- 22:35.040* :  that could not happen.
*22:35.220- 22:37.040* :  Did you think Americans would get that first?
*22:37.340- 22:37.980* :  I had no idea.
*22:38.620- 22:40.000* :  Actually, it was a race.
*22:40.480- 22:42.580* :  There was no promise that Americans would quote,
*22:42.580- 22:43.300* :  get there first.
*22:43.340- 22:47.320* :  That boot of Neil Armstrong's left foot landed in 1969.
*22:47.360- 22:50.780* :  But in 1968, you went to see the film,
*22:51.240- 22:52.840* :  Kubrick's 2001 Space Odyssey.
*22:52.920- 22:53.720* :  I can't speak enough.
*22:53.960- 22:55.400* :  This is the other thing about The Moon
*22:55.400- 22:58.600* :  that holds its sway on me is that it is an artistic enterprise
*22:58.600- 23:00.420* :  and a poetic enterprise as well.
*23:00.540- 23:01.440* :  I'm trying to do the math.
*23:01.520- 23:05.620* :  I was in 2012 in 1968 when I saw 2000 on a Space Odyssey.
*23:05.760- 23:09.840* :  Literally, I'm seeing stuff that I don't know how they shot this movie.
*23:09.960- 23:11.480* :  I looked at the Moon through telescopes.
*23:11.480- 23:12.880* :  I looked at pictures of the Moon.
*23:12.900- 23:16.020* :  I knew that we were going to race with a Russian's owner to get there.
*23:16.020- 23:19.080* :  And here, Stanley Kubrick had Russians talk to Americans
*23:19.080- 23:20.100* :  on the way to the Moon.
*23:20.100- 23:23.100* :  It was a time machine that took not into the past,
*23:23.120- 23:24.320* :  but took you into the future and said,
*23:24.320- 23:25.420* :  this is how it's going to be.
*23:25.560- 23:27.420* :  The thing is, it's going to happen in a new race.
*23:27.720- 23:29.580* :  You've got the Indians have just landed on.
*23:30.060- 23:31.540* :  You've got the Russians crash landed.
*23:31.540- 23:34.360* :  The Chinese are always sending a probe there.
*23:34.580- 23:37.080* :  Can you see a world where the Americans are on a permanent base?
*23:37.400- 23:39.640* :  The Indians are over there and the Chinese land.
*23:40.020- 23:41.120* :  We're in a new race.
*23:41.160- 23:42.660* :  It's like a script of one of your movies.
*23:42.980- 23:46.520* :  I think a race would actually be not the best way to put it.
*23:46.520- 23:49.340* :  I would say that there was going to be a cooperative effort.
*23:49.500- 23:51.580* :  They're not going to have the same way of doing it.
*23:51.940- 23:53.680* :  We are sending human beings.
*23:54.040- 23:56.820* :  When they start sending people up there,
*23:57.120- 23:59.640* :  that means whoever is there for archivists
*23:59.640- 24:01.400* :  is going to have neighbors nearby.
*24:02.340- 24:04.440* :  And the world is better when you cooperate with your neighbors.
*24:04.760- 24:06.580* :  The world is better when they might need somebody
*24:06.580- 24:07.640* :  who can learn from each other.
*24:07.640- 24:10.380* :  You know what is going to be the next great moment
*24:10.940- 24:16.480* :  in human evolution when the first child is born on the Moon?
*24:17.300- 24:20.680* :  You want to talk about the fame of somebody like Neil Armstrong.
*24:21.200- 24:23.640* :  Someone on the Moon who is there for a while
*24:23.940- 24:25.400* :  is going to get knocked up.
*24:25.820- 24:28.800* :  You know, and it might not be the best thing in the world
*24:28.800- 24:32.920* :  to send that pregnant woman back to Earth and deal with that.
*24:33.400- 24:35.520* :  So maybe the thing to do, which is keep them up there
*24:35.600- 24:40.620* :  and welcome the truly first alien born human being.
*24:40.920- 24:43.520* :  And if we could figure out how to live there and use that
*24:43.720- 24:45.500* :  as the next stepping stone to whatever else
*24:45.500- 24:47.760* :  is coming down the pipe, Mars or beyond,
*24:47.760- 24:52.180* :  isn't that almost the spiritual quest of all mankind?
*24:53.180- 24:55.780* :  Tom Hanks speaking there to Paddy O'Connell.
*24:57.040- 24:58.840* :  It's taken more than 50 years to produce.
*24:58.940- 25:02.800* :  It's cost at least $40 million and covers an area
*25:02.800- 25:04.740* :  of about two square kilometers.
*25:05.320- 25:08.680* :  Called City, it's a sprawling contemporary work of art
*25:08.960- 25:11.240* :  in a remote corner of the US state of Nevada,
*25:11.700- 25:14.000* :  which is now finally open to the public.
*25:14.520- 25:17.400* :  Composed of shaped mounds and depressions made
*25:17.400- 25:20.960* :  of dirt, rock and concrete, the land artist Michael Heiser
*25:21.260- 25:23.420* :  spent much of his career moving mountains
*25:23.460- 25:26.420* :  to create what many believe is a masterpiece.
*25:27.080- 25:29.600* :  The BBC's Reagan Morris has been to see it.
*25:31.820- 25:36.560* :  I'm walking through city deep in remote Nevada desert.
*25:37.240- 25:40.040* :  It is very difficult to describe.
*25:40.840- 25:43.500* :  It looks like racetracks and lines
*25:43.540- 25:45.660* :  and sculpted hills through the desert.
*25:45.660- 25:48.700* :  But when you drive in, you really can't see any of it.
*25:48.700- 25:51.120* :  You just see some gentle rolling burns, hills.
*25:51.800- 25:53.200* :  And then you walk into this.
*25:53.880- 25:55.940* :  And you just get lost really for a few hours.
*25:57.140- 25:58.940* :  And all you hear are your footsteps.
*25:59.480- 26:04.480* :  And when you stop, it's one of the quietest places
*26:04.480- 26:05.300* :  I've ever been.
*26:06.080- 26:09.100* :  If an alien in a spacesuit land here
*26:09.640- 26:11.600* :  would seem just as normal as a cheman,
*26:11.800- 26:15.140* :  and like a loin cloth, showed up with like a tiger.
*26:15.220- 26:17.400* :  That's Tristan Tuckfield and Josh Porrow
*26:17.400- 26:19.240* :  grappling to describe city.
*26:19.680- 26:21.860* :  Only six people can visit per day
*26:22.080- 26:25.520* :  and the tickets are $150 each, sold through a lottery.
*26:26.200- 26:27.620* :  They're already sold out for this year.
*26:27.940- 26:30.660* :  If you do get a ticket, you need to drive three hours
*26:31.000- 26:32.060* :  north of Las Vegas.
*26:32.580- 26:33.740* :  Arrive before sunrise.
*26:34.360- 26:36.800* :  Bring good walking shoes and an open mind.
*26:37.280- 26:39.220* :  If someone said, so this is something
*26:39.220- 26:41.500* :  that aliens created, you'd be like,
*26:41.500- 26:44.080* :  yes, I see that by areas 51, that makes sense.
*26:45.280- 26:47.460* :  Or if they said it was like an ancient civilization
*26:47.460- 26:50.480* :  that created it, yeah, that makes sense.
*26:51.760- 26:53.200* :  Those are very valid comments.
*26:53.400- 26:56.320* :  Michael Goven is the director of the Los Angeles County Museum
*26:56.320- 26:58.680* :  of Art and one of the biggest champions
*26:58.680- 27:00.920* :  of city and the artist, Michael Heiser.
*27:01.300- 27:03.580* :  His father was an archaeological anthropologist.
*27:03.740- 27:06.740* :  And so it's a young person was exposed
*27:07.120- 27:09.760* :  to quite a high level of knowledge
*27:09.760- 27:11.940* :  and experience with ancient cultures.
*27:12.320- 27:14.320* :  Of course, he's also on highways
*27:14.320- 27:16.900* :  and in California, which is super modern.
*27:17.380- 27:19.800* :  And there's this sense about all of his work
*27:19.800- 27:23.480* :  that it feels like we have one foot in our ancient past
*27:23.480- 27:25.700* :  and one footer in our modern future, right?
*27:26.000- 27:27.400* :  And those are hard to put together.
*27:27.900- 27:29.200* :  So that feeling you just expressed
*27:29.240- 27:32.780* :  is I would argue is what's very unique about it.
*27:33.300- 27:35.360* :  It's believed to be the largest contemporary work
*27:35.360- 27:36.360* :  of art in the world.
*27:36.960- 27:38.580* :  The scale is rather astonishing.
*27:40.080- 27:44.460* :  In the age of social media, when pop-up art museums are there
*27:44.460- 27:46.700* :  for Instagram and Facebook, this is a place
*27:46.700- 27:48.320* :  no selfie can capture this.
*27:48.780- 27:51.860* :  And the artist just says no really TV cameras can capture this.
*27:51.860- 27:55.140* :  He doesn't want this to be documented in that way.
*27:55.140- 27:56.560* :  He wants it to be experienced.
*27:56.620- 28:01.140* :  And I hear a jet high above going by
*28:01.140- 28:04.520* :  and that's one of the only artificial sounds I've heard.
*28:05.000- 28:07.960* :  I'm told the staff will cover up our footprints.
*28:09.000- 28:13.740* :  After we leave, the artist who rarely speaks publicly
*28:13.740- 28:16.300* :  about his work has been quoted as saying,
*28:16.900- 28:18.460* :  he thinks they can't wait for him to die
*28:18.460- 28:19.600* :  so they can build a gift shop.
*28:20.580- 28:21.980* :  There's definitely no gift shop.
*28:22.800- 28:25.000* :  We've had board meetings with Michael telling us
*28:25.000- 28:26.400* :  what he will and will not tolerate.
*28:26.520- 28:28.980* :  And I can guarantee you a gift shop is number one
*28:28.980- 28:30.160* :  on the list of will not.
*28:30.660- 28:34.080* :  Cara Vanderweg is a senior director at Gagosian galleries,
*28:34.080- 28:36.320* :  which represents Michael Heiser's work.
*28:36.580- 28:39.280* :  This crazy person decided in 1970
*28:39.320- 28:41.220* :  first just wanted to build one big sculpture
*28:41.220- 28:42.160* :  in the middle of the desert
*28:42.220- 28:43.340* :  because he thought he was gonna die.
*28:43.340- 28:45.880* :  He thought that there was going to be a nuclear war
*28:46.160- 28:47.580* :  or Vietnam was happening.
*28:47.580- 28:49.460* :  I mean, he didn't know what the future looked like
*28:49.500- 28:51.040* :  but he wanted to make a grand gesture
*28:51.400- 28:53.340* :  and he's been able to build it
*28:53.480- 28:55.020* :  and isn't that terrific?
*28:55.020- 28:56.480* :  It's kind of hopeful.
*28:57.100- 29:00.300* :  Cara Vanderweg, senior director of Gagosian galleries
*29:00.300- 29:02.860* :  finishing that report from Reagan Morris.
*29:03.720- 29:07.060* :  And finally, garlic, a delicious ingredient
*29:07.060- 29:08.860* :  in many recipes across the world
*29:08.900- 29:12.540* :  but one known to result in not to put too fine a point on it,
*29:13.040- 29:13.740* :  smelly breath.
*29:14.280- 29:16.160* :  But now scientists in the United States
*29:16.580- 29:19.080* :  say they may have found the secret solution
*29:19.080- 29:22.220* :  to bad breath caused by the pungent vegetable.
*29:23.220- 29:26.080* :  Phoebe Hobson told me more about what they discovered.
*29:26.740- 29:29.620* :  Well, the science says that yogurt could be the trick
*29:29.620- 29:31.080* :  of warding off garlic breath.
*29:31.360- 29:33.380* :  Everyone has had that paranoia at some stage
*29:33.820- 29:35.460* :  after tucking into a delicious meal
*29:35.860- 29:36.740* :  where there's lots of garlic
*29:36.740- 29:38.820* :  and then you have to go to an important meeting
*29:38.820- 29:40.200* :  or even go on a date
*29:40.280- 29:41.980* :  and you're so worried that your breath might smell.
*29:42.440- 29:44.620* :  So according now to scientists at the University
*29:44.620- 29:46.400* :  of Columbus in Ohio State,
*29:46.880- 29:48.140* :  they say that a spoonful of yogurt
*29:48.140- 29:51.680* :  taken shortly after eating can help deodorize
*29:51.680- 29:53.220* :  the sulfurous components in garlic
*29:53.220- 29:56.540* :  that give it that odor that sort of lingers after you eat it.
*29:57.020- 29:58.780* :  It's the fat and the protein in yogurt.
*29:58.960- 30:01.000* :  So previously research has suggested
*30:01.000- 30:03.080* :  that drinking whole milk could do the trick.
*30:03.080- 30:04.940* :  But actually it's the fat and the protein in yogurt.
*30:05.520- 30:07.440* :  The scientists involved in the research said
*30:07.480- 30:10.520* :  that in fact Greek yogurt would be particularly good at doing
*30:10.520- 30:11.900* :  which is actually quite funny
*30:11.900- 30:13.380* :  because Greek food does actually contain
*30:13.380- 30:14.440* :  a lot of garlic itself.
*30:14.440- 30:16.220* :  So perhaps it's the perfect combination.
*30:17.180- 30:19.020* :  Yeah, so if you do enjoy a garlic meal,
*30:19.020- 30:20.360* :  you have to look for the yogurt afterwards.
*30:20.920- 30:22.400* :  Why Greek yogurt in particular?
*30:22.700- 30:23.440* :  Just because it's thick.
*30:23.560- 30:25.840* :  It's very thick and so it's particularly high in protein
*30:25.840- 30:29.700* :  and it's that protein, garlic and deodorizers that stench.
*30:30.060- 30:32.900* :  This works both fried garlic and also raw garlic.
*30:33.580- 30:34.440* :  Breaking news this.
*30:34.600- 30:35.500* :  This is breaking news.
*30:35.520- 30:36.580* :  Perhaps even more breaking news
*30:36.580- 30:38.280* :  you can also reach for a raw apple
*30:38.600- 30:41.080* :  or perhaps mint or lettuce if you don't have yogurt to hand.
*30:41.160- 30:42.960* :  So perhaps having a salad after dinner.
*30:43.300- 30:44.140* :  Oh, indeed, brush your teeth.
*30:44.240- 30:45.400* :  Or perhaps brush your teeth as well.
*30:46.220- 30:48.160* :  Now you know, Phoebe hops in there.
*30:50.840- 30:51.820* :  And that's it from us for now,
*30:51.820- 30:52.960* :  but there'll be a new addition
*30:52.960- 30:54.840* :  of the Global News Podcast later.

*31:40.160- 31:41.060* :  A bowl of coffee.
*31:41.060- 31:41.940* :  Give me a dolphin.
*31:43.080- 31:44.120* :  What's that spell?
*31:44.400- 31:45.260* :  San Diego.
*31:45.940- 31:47.900* :  If you're happy and you know it, San Diego
