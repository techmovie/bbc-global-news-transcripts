*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.060* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.320- 00:24.120* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 29th of September, these are our main stories.
*00:24.780- 00:29.100* :  Two large explosions in different parts of Pakistan have caused multiple casualties.
*00:29.180- 00:34.620* :  The UN says there's been a 60% increase in the number of unaccompanied child migrants
*00:34.620- 00:40.100* :  making the dangerous sea crossing to Europe and the leader of Spain's conservative people's party
*00:40.100- 00:48.000* :  has failed to form a government again. Also in this podcast, aid officials have warned that the entire
*00:48.000- 00:52.960* :  population of Nagorno-Karabakh might leave after Azerbaijan seized control.
*00:53.580- 00:57.440* :  Such is very bad, terribly bad.
*01:06.080- 01:11.480* :  And scientists in Spain say a pair of shoes discovered in a cave are 6,000 years old.
*01:20.900- 01:25.700* :  We begin in Pakistan, though, where there have been two deadly explosions in separate areas
*01:25.700- 01:30.380* :  on the day people gathered for prayers and to commemorate the birth of the Prophet Muhammad.
*01:31.040- 01:35.620* :  At least 50 people were killed including a senior police officer in Baluchistan
*01:35.620- 01:40.140* :  in the southwest of the country in what is believed to be a suicide attack.
*01:40.700- 01:45.680* :  Later, a blast at a mosque in a northern province of the country calls the collapse of parts of
*01:45.680- 01:50.280* :  the building, killing at least four people. Dozens are still reported to be trapped.
*01:50.280- 01:55.580* :  Our correspondents Sahir Buluch is following developments from Islamabad and gave me the latest.
*01:56.040- 02:01.000* :  The police chief in Baluchistan has said that this was a suicide attack and at the same time,
*02:01.000- 02:05.880* :  Pakistani Taliban have also issued a statement saying that they have nothing to do with both
*02:05.880- 02:10.600* :  these incidents, whether it was in Baluchistan or in Heberpaktun for province of Pakistan,
*02:10.600- 02:14.400* :  and they have said that they condemn any attack on these places as well.
*02:14.400- 02:19.720* :  And also reiterated their earlier claim that they do not target worship places or schools.
*02:20.200- 02:25.620* :  So this is quite interesting at a time when the police is suspecting Pakistani Taliban
*02:25.620- 02:29.520* :  to be behind these attacks. But at the same time, it also begs for a bigger question
*02:29.960- 02:34.040* :  than who was behind this attack. And secondly, what was their motivation?
*02:34.720- 02:39.720* :  Is there any sense, any evidence, any informed speculation at this stage that they may have
*02:39.720- 02:46.120* :  been coordinated attacks? No, so far, there is no claim on that and the police is also not
*02:46.120- 02:51.000* :  revealing a lot at the moment. The police basically was suspecting the Pakistani Taliban because
*02:51.000- 02:56.800* :  in an earlier attack in Mustung as well, which is in Baluchistan, a political party was targeted
*02:56.800- 03:01.360* :  at that point of time and that attack was claimed by the Islamic state over there as well.
*03:01.600- 03:06.060* :  Also, Mustung is placed in a place which is very closer to Afghanistan border.
*03:06.480- 03:11.160* :  So people had been claiming for a while and they had been giving these statements to the police
*03:11.160- 03:16.620* :  also in Baluchistan and in Heberpaktun for that the Taliban have been infiltrating their areas
*03:16.620- 03:21.440* :  and something should be done about it. And these things were happening in past two years.
*03:21.720- 03:26.160* :  But nothing was done and now we are seeing what is happening in the province. So extremism is
*03:26.160- 03:30.340* :  still a bigger issue in Pakistan. Can I just ask quickly about the significance of today?
*03:30.340- 03:34.520* :  It's Friday, prayers day, but it's also the day in which some celebrate the birthday of
*03:34.940- 03:38.820* :  Prophet Muhammad. Do you see any significance in these attacks happening today in particular?
*03:39.260- 03:44.600* :  Yes, actually it is a big day for Muslims like across Pakistan. So it's Prophet Muhammad's
*03:44.600- 03:48.980* :  birthday, basically birthday anniversary and a lot of people celebrate that with a lot of
*03:48.980- 03:54.720* :  reverence and a lot of love. And this attack in Mustung was also part of that because there was
*03:54.720- 03:59.280* :  a congregation that was about to go ahead and they were celebrating and they were holding flags
*03:59.280- 04:02.860* :  in everything and they were people like it was not like part of a political party's
*04:02.940- 04:06.360* :  you know procession or anything. It was like normal people going out about their business
*04:06.740- 04:11.780* :  and they were attacked. So this is actually like you know a big big thing for you know people in
*04:11.780- 04:17.100* :  Pakistan right now. At the same time you know every Friday for past 10 years this was a norm like
*04:17.100- 04:21.280* :  every Friday and especially on Thursday as well. There used to be blasts that used to happen
*04:21.760- 04:25.920* :  but now it has stopped and now once again people are reminded of that bloody decade as well.
*04:26.700- 04:30.960* :  Let's go to Europe now where there has been a big jump in the number of unaccompanied children
*04:30.960- 04:36.260* :  trying to reach the continent by crossing the Mediterranean in boats as leaders from nine European
*04:36.260- 04:41.420* :  countries meet in Malta to discuss the growing number of migrants trying to make the journey
*04:41.420- 04:46.960* :  from Africa. The UN's children's agency says there's been a 60% rise in the last year
*04:46.960- 04:53.180* :  and many don't survive the journey. At a news conference in Geneva Regina de Domenici unicevs
*04:53.180- 04:58.300* :  regional director for Europe and Central Asia said more children were dying as a result of
*04:58.300- 05:06.980* :  political choices and a defective migration system. This summer we saw a tripling number of children
*05:06.980- 05:12.840* :  and adults dying on the central Mediterranean sea migration route compared to the last summer.
*05:13.700- 05:21.720* :  Mediterranean has become a symmetry for children and for their future. Policies today prevent
*05:21.720- 05:27.660* :  an effective and coordinated search and rescue at sea. Well I got more on this from our
*05:27.660- 05:33.520* :  correspondent in Geneva, imagine folks. Not UNICEF is saying between January and now September
*05:33.560- 05:42.000* :  this year 11,600 children that they classify that as young people under the age of 18 legally
*05:42.000- 05:51.000* :  minors unaccompanied minors crossed the Mediterranean in these very risky boats and that between June
*05:51.000- 05:56.780* :  and August of this year they recorded more than 900 deaths. That's of all people, adults as well
*05:56.780- 06:02.780* :  as children but that is also a shocking figure and that's three times as many as the same period
*06:03.400- 06:08.600* :  last year and one of the things that I think UNICEF in its statement today is particularly
*06:08.600- 06:17.080* :  concerned about is that the kind of conditions if they survive the journey that they arrive in in
*06:17.080- 06:25.080* :  Europe are really not fit for children and that Europe arguing in Brussels about you know funding
*06:25.080- 06:31.480* :  for certain rescue boats and so on is just not looking at properly at how they should be protecting
*06:31.480- 06:37.180* :  children and their rights and their safety if they do arrive in Europe. And can I just ask in
*06:37.180- 06:41.600* :  this report from the UN's children's agency is there any sense of why they think there's been
*06:41.600- 06:46.440* :  such a sharp increase in the number of unaccompanied children in particular or does that mirror
*06:46.440- 06:51.680* :  the broader trend of an increase in numbers of everyone trying to come. I think to certain extent
*06:51.680- 06:57.440* :  it mirrors the broader trend of more people trying to come. I mean I'm looking at UNICEF
*06:57.440- 07:04.280* :  statement now very starkly more conflict violence and poverty are the main drivers for children
*07:04.280- 07:10.480* :  fleeing their home countries. I mean as we know sometimes it's acute poverty which may not really
*07:10.480- 07:17.860* :  be seen as a reason to seek asylum in Europe but a family will save up and send a young person
*07:17.860- 07:23.220* :  under the age of 18 to Europe in the hope of them achieving a better life. And fortunately what
*07:23.220- 07:30.460* :  UNICEF is saying is that over 20,000 in Italy alone children are being held in closed detention
*07:30.460- 07:36.520* :  centres so nothing like a better life. Imogen folks reporting the United Nations refugee
*07:36.520- 07:42.660* :  agency has warned that the entire population of Nagorno-Karabakh may flee in the wake of Azerbaijan's
*07:42.660- 07:48.380* :  takeover. More than 90,000 have left already about three-quarters of those who lived in the
*07:48.380- 07:54.220* :  disputed territory until last week. A UN spokeswoman said they were arriving in neighbouring Armenia,
*07:54.220- 08:00.580* :  scared, frightened and full of anxiety. About a third of the refugees are children many have been
*08:00.580- 08:05.600* :  separated from their families. Sarah Reinsford said this report from the town of Gorish on the
*08:05.600- 08:12.440* :  Armenian border. The children of Nagorno-Karabakh have known two wars in their short lives.
*08:13.280- 08:20.160* :  Now they've fled as refugees. The land they grew up on has been disputed for decades but for them
*08:20.160- 08:28.400* :  it was just home. Their father Gavorg fought for Karabakh in 2020 and again last week so I ask how he
*08:28.400- 08:38.280* :  feels about leaving about surrender. Very bad, terribly bad. Should it have been done differently?
*08:38.280- 08:49.900* :  Could you have got more help? What else could we do? I don't know. I'm too upset. I can't answer
*08:49.900- 08:57.760* :  these questions. The Armenian border town of Gorish has taken in so many refugees, some are
*08:57.760- 09:03.520* :  sleeping in their cars. Vehicles that now carry a life's worth of possessions.
*09:05.860- 09:09.620* :  The Exodus happened so quickly many here still seem stunned.
*09:12.240- 09:18.540* :  There is a giant scramble to help the tens of thousands in need including the most vulnerable.
*09:22.120- 09:28.180* :  Donations are flooding in, scooped up by exhausted families who have often traveled for days to
*09:28.180- 09:36.580* :  reach here. Sophia and Angelina are still recovering from their trip and from a day under fire in
*09:36.580- 09:42.900* :  their village right on the front line. Mariam's husband was hit by shrapnel then but he didn't want to
*09:42.900- 09:48.780* :  be filmed. The family are being hosted by a woman who fled Nagona Karabakh in the last war.
*09:49.460- 09:55.700* :  Now she's helping a new wave of refugees. Today they all saw the official decree that the
*09:55.700- 09:59.600* :  Separatist Republic, which they call Artsakh, was being dissolved.
*10:03.060- 10:10.380* :  30 years building our lifestyles, then they say there is no Artsakh anymore. That is a tragedy for
*10:10.380- 10:19.280* :  the Armenian people. But we have no strength left to fight because we were left alone. We were abandoned.
*10:22.600- 10:29.240* :  Nagona Karabakh is rapidly emptying out. But as they go, the ethnic Armenians are not only
*10:29.240- 10:36.640* :  leaving their homes and their property. They're also surrendering their long dream of independence.
*10:39.380- 10:45.220* :  Sarah Rainsford reporting. Sweden's Prime Minister has used a televised national address to say he's
*10:45.220- 10:50.420* :  considering deploying military patrols on the streets of the country's capital to deal with heightened
*10:50.420- 10:56.180* :  gun violence. 11 people have died in gang violence this month alone. Prime Minister Ulf Christian
*10:56.180- 11:02.100* :  Sean is holding talks with the head of the police and the armed forces. So how serious is this
*11:02.100- 11:05.540* :  for Sweden? Well, I asked Maddie Savage, a journalist in Stockholm.
*11:06.100- 11:11.380* :  It's a really serious situation and the level of conversation around this is bigger than there
*11:11.380- 11:17.060* :  has been in years here in Sweden. The Prime Minister has begun talks with the supreme commander
*11:17.060- 11:21.260* :  of the Swedish armed forces. We understand that they're taking place and they're due to report
*11:21.260- 11:26.380* :  back in about 40 minutes. And this after this rare televised address, which I think
*11:26.380- 11:31.980* :  shows the scale of this problem on Thursday night. When the Prime Minister said he wanted the Swedish
*11:32.460- 11:36.720* :  military to help to tackle a wave of gang related violence. And we understand they're looking
*11:36.720- 11:42.960* :  into ways in which that could work. Earlier on, there was another news conference from the
*11:43.080- 11:48.260* :  National Police Commissioner of Sweden Anders Tornberg. And he said that the police could get
*11:48.260- 11:53.180* :  involved in cooperating with the military, for instance, by the military helping with transport,
*11:53.180- 11:58.720* :  logistics and guarding duties. In order to free up the police resources to focus more on
*11:58.720- 12:04.360* :  gang crime and tackling this wave and shootings. Okay. Can I ask for a bit more context in
*12:04.360- 12:11.140* :  why the gun violence in particular has become so bad? And is there agreement on politicians and
*12:11.140- 12:15.560* :  other figures in society about what's caused this? I think there's an agreement across the board
*12:15.560- 12:21.100* :  now that this is a huge problem that needs to be tackled. But exactly what the root causes are,
*12:21.100- 12:27.120* :  do differ depending on who you speak to. One particular issue that's come up recently has been
*12:27.420- 12:33.020* :  the fact that young children from impoverished areas are increasingly being recruited on social
*12:33.020- 12:39.400* :  media. They're being lured in by videos about getting new trainers and fancy gadgets. And there's
*12:39.400- 12:45.560* :  a lot of talk that older gang members are basically recruiting these youngsters because they won't
*12:45.560- 12:50.840* :  face such tough prison sentences. And so the fact that this trend is moving towards children is
*12:50.840- 12:56.080* :  something that I think has caused the problem to escalate. Those on the right argue that a lot of
*12:56.080- 13:00.940* :  these crimes have been taking place in areas, vulnerable areas with high immigrant populations.
*13:00.940- 13:05.260* :  And they're blaming it on a clash of cultures. But if you speak to others on the left, they say
*13:05.260- 13:10.580* :  it's issues to do with integration, high levels of poverty and unemployment. And that more needs to
*13:10.580- 13:15.700* :  be done to tackle the root cause rather than simply going out there with the military and
*13:15.700- 13:19.840* :  potentially with tougher punishments. They're looking for more social measures alongside this.
*13:20.160- 13:25.600* :  Maddie Savage talking to me from Stockholm. Nearly 40 years after his death, a previously
*13:25.600- 13:30.940* :  unknown work by the acclaimed American writer Truman Capote has been brought to light thanks to
*13:30.940- 13:36.780* :  some literary sleuthing by the editor of the Strand magazine. Andrew Shelley discovered the story
*13:36.780- 13:41.820* :  written in a notebook. It was then carefully deciphered and transcribed. In his day,
*13:41.820- 13:47.460* :  Capote was regarded as one of America's most compelling observers of humanity. He's best known
*13:47.460- 13:52.580* :  for the true crime novel in Cold Blood and the novella Breakfast at Tiffany's. Here's an
*13:52.580- 13:58.080* :  excerpt from the new story, Another Day in Paradise. It was so humiliating that Carlo should have
*13:58.080- 14:04.740* :  turned out not to be a friend. She had trusted him to the extent of her capital. Let him sell her
*14:04.740- 14:11.360* :  the land, allowed him to build the villa, supply at pirate prices the native paraphernalia
*14:11.360- 14:18.920* :  that furnished it. He was an emotional crook and beyond that a common gangster who'd pocketed at
*14:18.920- 14:27.340* :  least half the money supposedly spent on Belfastay. All this she could forgive him could but didn't.
*14:28.480- 14:32.560* :  Well, the Strand editor Mr. Shelley has been talking about how it came to be published.
*14:33.240- 14:39.920* :  The story is a day in the life of a character and it's a character who's rather been betrayed and
*14:39.920- 14:48.700* :  is suffering from a very, very bad day and he's living in this wonderful, sun-swept town in southern
*14:48.700- 14:57.660* :  Italy but he hates everything around her and he comes across another person who in contrast to her
*14:57.660- 15:04.660* :  has lost a lot. He said many tragic things happen to her but unlike the main character Iris Green
*15:04.680- 15:10.600* :  Tree, he's trying to have a better outlook of life trying to form a human connection. You have
*15:10.600- 15:16.540* :  some interesting plot twists and add a little Janzano wine and you have a wonderful little story
*15:16.540- 15:22.360* :  by Truman Capote. So the interesting thing is why was this not published and I'm afraid I don't have
*15:22.360- 15:29.500* :  a good answer about that when I was doing some research in the indexes of the Library of Congress
*15:30.100- 15:34.460* :  during that time you know I just said you know I might as well like look in the indexes of
*15:34.460- 15:43.240* :  Truman Capote and to my surprise this story turned up. It was in a red notebook and it was written
*15:43.240- 15:50.380* :  in pencil and it had handwriting that at times it's very difficult to decipher and there was a
*15:50.420- 15:58.520* :  mark on the notebook that the notebook was bought at a very old stationer in Venice in St. Mark's
*15:58.540- 16:07.860* :  Square. In 1950 Truman Capote visited Italy, he stayed there for a long time and he rented a house
*16:08.700- 16:13.560* :  and he wrote an essay about the house that he had rented and the people and the characters surrounding
*16:13.560- 16:22.140* :  that area and it was called Fontana Vettia and that house was the basis for the house and this story
*16:22.140- 16:29.780* :  another day in paradise. Andrew Chilli on a newly discovered Capote story. Still to come on the global
*16:35.800- 16:40.360* :  news podcast. Over some of the protests were ferocious, now that the law is actually there the
*16:40.360- 16:45.920* :  rail has calmed down. We'll have more on the heated debate over German is planned to phase out
*16:54.260- 16:58.240* :  fossil fuel heating. Welcome back to the global news podcast. The leader of Spain's Conservative
*16:58.240- 17:03.720* :  People's Party has once again failed to form a ruling coalition with Parliament voting against
*17:03.720- 17:09.320* :  his proposed government. The People's Party came first in July's general election but Alberto
*17:09.320- 17:14.980* :  Fahel did not attract sufficient support from other parties to form a majority in the country's
*17:14.980- 17:19.540* :  parliament. The correspondent Guy Hedgeko in Madrid told my colleague Lucy Hawking.
*17:44.540- 17:50.120* :  In the vote earlier in the week it was the far right vox party and that meant that many other
*17:50.120- 17:56.800* :  parties which might have considered supporting him decided not to and so for the second time this
*17:56.800- 18:02.360* :  week Mr Nouni-Fahel has lost an investiture vote and this one is definitive. We've just seen him
*18:02.360- 18:10.460* :  leaving Mr Fahel the council chamber. He got a rousing round of applause there as he left
*18:10.460- 18:15.580* :  Guy and all the politicians are now leaving the chamber at the moment but what happened now?
*18:15.880- 18:21.540* :  We expect King Felipe to invite Pedro Sanchez the acting prime minister and leader of the
*18:21.540- 18:26.720* :  socialist party to try and form a government. He was runner up in July's general election behind
*18:26.720- 18:34.520* :  Mr Nouni-Fahel and so in the coming weeks Mr Sanchez is expected to be logged in negotiations with
*18:34.900- 18:39.480* :  other parties in Parliament to try and get their support. Now he appears to have a slightly
*18:39.480- 18:46.500* :  better chance of securing a majority than his conservative rival. However he will need the
*18:46.500- 18:53.420* :  support of Catalan nationalists. They in exchange are asking for for example an amnesty for all
*18:53.980- 18:59.740* :  independence Catalan independence leaders who are facing legal action. That's a very controversial
*18:59.740- 19:04.140* :  request that they're making of Mr Sanchez. So I think we're going to see a lot of scrutiny
*19:04.140- 19:09.160* :  of those negotiations between Mr Sanchez and Catalan nationalists in the coming weeks. Of
*19:09.160- 19:13.760* :  course Mr Sanchez fails to form a government himself then there will be a repeat election
*19:13.760- 19:20.380* :  in mid-January. Guy I was in Spain very briefly recently and just speaking to people they're so
*19:20.380- 19:26.380* :  fed up and frustrated the idea of another election. People were really just couldn't quite
*19:26.380- 19:31.220* :  believe it. Can you describe for us the general public sentiment around political life?
*19:31.420- 19:36.820* :  We've had five general elections in the last decade. This could be a sixth one coming up in
*19:36.820- 19:40.300* :  January. People are exhausted with it. They are fed up. They're fed up with their politicians.
*19:40.840- 19:44.580* :  They're fed up with the fact that they can't reach a consensus and form a majority.
*19:44.820- 19:48.820* :  There's a very good reason for that and that's because a number of new parties have emerged over
*19:48.820- 19:53.960* :  the last few years on the far left and on the far right for example. And that has fragmented
*19:53.960- 19:58.480* :  the political landscape. Made it much more difficult for the two traditional big parties,
*19:58.480- 20:04.740* :  the socialists and the conservatives to simply win a majority on their own. So that explains it
*20:04.780- 20:08.480* :  but obviously people are upset by it and they feel that they're in a kind of political limbo
*20:08.480- 20:12.940* :  and people in the economics sphere feel that this is not good for the economy either.
*20:13.480- 20:17.600* :  Guy Hegeko in Madrid. Now let's stay in Europe where Germany the
*20:17.600- 20:22.280* :  continent's biggest economy is the latest country to battle with differing opinions over the
*20:22.280- 20:28.160* :  pace of change required to hit targets on cutting carbon emissions. With an economic downturn and
*20:28.160- 20:33.700* :  a rising cost of living in many countries a speedy switch to green energy is being questioned by some.
*20:34.060- 20:39.780* :  Germany where the green party is part of the government is aiming to be carbon neutral by 2045
*20:39.820- 20:45.040* :  but there's been much debate about a new law to phase out fossil fuels for heating homes
*20:45.520- 20:52.500* :  as Damien McGinnitz reports from Berlin. Here in this workshop apprentices are learning how to
*20:52.500- 20:58.580* :  install gas boilers. That's how most German homes are heated but the humble gas boiler has become
*20:58.580- 21:04.860* :  the center of a huge political rower here. Brotests rower in parliament and some even thought the
*21:04.860- 21:09.620* :  government might collapse at one point. Never before have heating systems created such a nation-wide
*21:09.620- 21:14.640* :  drama and it's all about a new law which phases out fossil fuel boilers and replaces them with
*21:14.640- 21:19.800* :  greener options such as heat pumps. You can also learn how to install those here too. Now show me
*21:19.800- 21:25.360* :  around this workshop is Andreas Cochmadin the head of the Berlin Guild for the heating and plumbing
*21:25.360- 21:31.960* :  industry that runs this training center. After this drama as you called it and now I would say
*21:32.360- 21:40.000* :  better this law than no law. Our craftsmen didn't know what can we say to our customers.
*21:40.820- 21:48.460* :  Nobody really knew what the direction was. More gas and oil boilers were installed than
*21:48.460- 21:53.560* :  heating pumps. So because of the uncertainty around the discussion people suddenly rushed to
*21:53.560- 21:59.180* :  install oil and gas boilers because they were afraid that they'd suddenly be forced to do
*21:59.180- 22:03.800* :  something they couldn't afford. And everybody was more or less irritated and confused.
*22:13.140- 22:18.960* :  No wonder people got confused. The bill leaked before it was ready and straight away tabloid
*22:18.960- 22:24.800* :  commentators said Germany had become a socialist dictatorship claiming that gas boilers would be
*22:24.800- 22:29.760* :  ripped out of people's homes and pensioners would freeze because they couldn't afford heat pumps.
*22:30.400- 22:35.040* :  In fact the law does not apply to existing heating systems and there's generous state support
*22:35.040- 22:40.180* :  for households that go green but the damage was done and the coalition's ratings have now dropped
*22:40.180- 22:46.840* :  to a record low. Green Party MP Ingrid Nestler who works on the coalition's energy policy admits
*22:46.840- 22:52.100* :  that the government was not prepared with an effective communication strategy to allay vote
*22:52.100- 22:58.220* :  as fears. It was a too heated debate. The debate about heating was too heated. Yeah exactly exactly
*22:58.220- 23:04.520* :  the heating really heated the debate and the tazum left some marks on the discussion culture
*23:05.140- 23:07.640* :  which I wish we would have found another way to discuss it.
*23:09.340- 23:14.420* :  Earlier this month the law was finally passed in Parliament but environmentally say that because of
*23:14.420- 23:20.500* :  the uproar the final version was watered down. So fossil fuel heating will be phased out later
*23:20.500- 23:26.740* :  than originally planned. Claudia Kemfert an economist who specialises in energy says this is a trend
*23:26.740- 23:31.600* :  we're seeing in many countries. It's always the same debate it seems as soon as you come to real
*23:31.600- 23:37.880* :  climate protection to concrete actions and what we need to do right now then there is a danger
*23:37.880- 23:45.540* :  to water down and fossil lobby comes in opponents come in and we might see it in other countries as well.
*23:50.800- 23:57.840* :  Over summer the protests were ferocious 13,000 people came to this demo in Bavaria to listen to
*23:57.840- 24:03.700* :  their regional leaders rail against Berlin's ban on boilers. Now that the law is actually there
*24:03.700- 24:09.480* :  the rail has calmed down but Germany's summer heads up over heating does show one thing.
*24:10.000- 24:15.120* :  voters may say in polls they want more action to fight climate change but as soon as that costs
*24:15.120- 24:18.200* :  the money governments better be ready to argue the case.
*24:23.580- 24:28.700* :  Damian McGuinness and Berlin. Now we do elections a lot on the BBC not many though in countries
*24:28.700- 24:33.800* :  that have an absolute monarchy and in Eswatini they really do have an absolute monarchy.
*24:33.800- 24:40.280* :  King Maswati III rules as Africa's last remaining monarch of this kind. Human rights
*24:40.280- 24:45.460* :  campaigners have dismissed a current parliamentary election in the country formerly known as Swaziland
*24:45.460- 24:51.580* :  as a fast those elected only take on an advisory role to the king. South Africa correspondent
*24:51.580- 24:58.560* :  Nomser Miseko told me more about it. Political parties were banned back in 1973 which
*24:58.560- 25:05.100* :  basically means anyone who any individual who wants to run for political office cannot have any
*25:05.100- 25:11.760* :  political affiliations so the more than half a million people who are going to be voting today
*25:11.760- 25:18.660* :  I expected to elect 59 members of the lower house of parliament which only plays an advisory
*25:18.700- 25:25.100* :  role to the king and Eswatini's electoral system known as Tinkuun's system elects members
*25:25.100- 25:31.000* :  of both the houses of parliament while the rest are directly appointed by the king meaning the
*25:31.000- 25:36.480* :  prime minister and the cabinet are directly appointed by the king and most of them are the
*25:36.480- 25:41.220* :  king's relatives. So just the king Misekoati does he pay much attention to the elected officials?
*25:41.600- 25:47.380* :  Not necessarily because political parties have been banned so most of the MPs even though they are
*25:47.500- 25:54.320* :  on their individual capacities to try and represent their constituencies most of them are still
*25:54.320- 26:01.200* :  loyal to the king so there isn't much that they can do you know despite having a essay in
*26:01.200- 26:08.040* :  you know as an as as advisors to the king people want change that is why these elections are
*26:08.040- 26:16.400* :  seen to be quite important because they are the first ones to take place since the 2021 pro-democracy
*26:16.620- 26:22.700* :  violent protests which led to the deaths of many people. So I mean following on from that
*26:22.700- 26:28.880* :  how stable do you think the king's position is and how secure is the monarchy this absolute monarchy
*26:29.180- 26:35.620* :  in Eswatini? Well the king still holds all the power in his country he's been in power for
*26:36.260- 26:41.900* :  37 years and that does not seem like it is going to change there are hopes though that if
*26:41.900- 26:47.860* :  political parties were to be unbanned in Swaziland there would be some reforms that would take
*26:47.860- 26:53.080* :  place. Nomsa Miseko reporting now let's end on something that's probably the back of your
*26:53.080- 26:58.980* :  wardrobe or maybe sitting by your front door a pair of shoes that you just can't let go off
*26:58.980- 27:04.120* :  they're old but you love them well scientists have identified what they think are the oldest shoes
*27:04.120- 27:09.900* :  ever found in Europe a pair of woven sandals that are believed to be around six thousand years old
*27:09.900- 27:15.580* :  were found in a cave in Spain and they survived because it's so dry his wendy orchard.
*27:16.000- 27:21.520* :  The items were first discovered deep inside the cave in the 19th century but scientists have
*27:21.520- 27:27.400* :  only recently realized that they're much older than previously thought six thousand two hundred
*27:27.400- 27:33.480* :  years old to be exact some parts of the sandals didn't survive but the intricately woven
*27:33.480- 27:40.300* :  espato grass souls are still intact and because they're small in size they probably belong to
*27:40.300- 27:46.020* :  children and would have been kept on their feet with twisted or braided cords but the shoes are
*27:46.020- 27:52.660* :  not the oldest items that were found several espato grass baskets were also discovered and they
*27:52.660- 27:59.340* :  date back nine thousand five hundred years to the mesolithic period four of them are in very good
*28:00.340- 28:06.920* :  scientists are also examining the mummified bodies stone stools ancient boars teeth and other
*28:06.920- 28:12.980* :  artifacts that were also found in the cave but it's the prehistoric shoes that are causing
*28:12.980- 28:19.520* :  the most excitement until now the oldest shoes found in Europe were made from grass and leather
*28:19.900- 28:25.280* :  and were at around five thousand years old they were discovered on the Italy Austria border
*28:25.660- 28:32.940* :  in 1991 so don't throw your espadrilles away at the end of the summer who knows they might last
*28:32.940- 28:41.480* :  another few thousand years right that's all from us for now but before we go here's Jackie with
