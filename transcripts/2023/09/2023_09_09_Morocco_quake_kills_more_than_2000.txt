01:19.120 - 01:22.300:  You're listening to the Global News podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:24.560 - 01:27.840:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Sunday,
01:27.840 - 01:34.400:  the 10th of September. Morocco declares three days of national mourning 24 hours after an earthquake
01:34.400 - 01:38.080:  killed 2,000 people. There appears the number could rise.
01:38.080 - 01:44.380:  Ukraine criticises leaders of the G20 group of rich nations for issuing a joint statement
01:44.380 - 01:49.100:  that fails to condemn Russia over its invasion and manhunt over.
01:49.480 - 01:53.900:  I stared at him. He stared at me and then I went home and told my husband that it was so odd.
01:53.900 - 01:56.840:  I thought he was a drug dealer or something. He wasn't a drug dealer. It was the guy.
01:57.320 - 02:02.240:  Three and a half days after a former British soldier and terror suspect escaped from jail,
02:02.680 - 02:03.520:  he's recaptured.
02:06.440 - 02:11.400:  Also in the podcast, three people are killed in the latest clashes at a huge Palestinian refugee
02:11.400 - 02:18.260:  camp in Lebanon and the fungus lodges itself onto the host's body, killing it slowly from within.
02:18.260 - 02:22.840:  Then in this spring it erupts out of the head of the dead Katerpillar.
02:23.440 - 02:28.620:  The fungus known as Himalayan Viagra that can sell for $5,000 a kilo.
02:34.260 - 02:38.880:  Three days of mourning have been declared in Morocco after the strongest earthquake
02:38.880 - 02:45.260:  in more than six decades. At least 2,000 people were killed with another 2,000 injured,
02:45.680 - 02:50.600:  many of them in critical condition. The number could rise as rescuers reach flattened
02:50.600 - 02:55.720:  villages near the epicenter in the high Atlas Mountains. Residents have been using bare hands to
02:55.720 - 03:01.200:  try to find people still trapped under the rubble. The relatively shallow quake struck midway
03:01.200 - 03:06.580:  between the cities of Agadir and Marrakesh, but the tremors were felt in the capital Rabat,
03:06.580 - 03:12.820:  some 350 kilometres away, as well as in Casablanca and Esawira, the Red Cross,
03:12.820 - 03:18.820:  so it could take years to repair the damage. Landslides block the main roads, the affected area,
03:19.260 - 03:21.480:  making it difficult for ambulances to get there.
03:26.580 - 03:30.340:  Our African regional editor Richard Hamilton has been following the story.
03:30.740 - 03:35.660:  A massive search and rescue operation is underway and the Moroccan authorities are trying to
03:35.660 - 03:41.380:  get food and supplies to people. Marrakesh, which as a UNESCO world heritage site,
03:41.380 - 03:47.000:  has been very badly damaged. Many hundreds of people slipped outside last night in the main
03:47.000 - 03:53.000:  square, the Jamar al-Fanar, which means assembly of the dead, but the worst place was, as you say,
03:53.000 - 03:58.180:  the Atlas Mountains in some 70 kilometres further south. People have been pulled from the rubble,
03:58.220 - 04:03.760:  but they say without medical help, they're simply dying. One British woman who lives in a village
04:03.760 - 04:09.740:  there said it's freezing cold, she described the scene as apocalyptic, and when the earthquake
04:09.740 - 04:15.560:  struck, she said her wall, it was like a square trying to turn into a parallelogram. She said
04:15.560 - 04:21.400:  people were crying and screaming. She said that a big hotel owned by the British billionaire,
04:21.400 - 04:27.000:  Richard Branson, was trying to supply food to people, and she said there was a huge sense of
04:27.000 - 04:33.000:  community. The villages are inhabited by the local Berber people, and they're incredibly tough
04:33.000 - 04:38.280:  and resilient. Now international assistance from experts often makes a difference in the early
04:38.280 - 04:43.400:  hours following an earthquake. Are they able to get in in this case? Well that's the big problem,
04:43.500 - 04:48.920:  and there's a massive land slide that has blocked one of the main roads south from Marrakesh towards
04:48.920 - 04:56.580:  the mountains, but helicopters are now trying to get supplies in, and the BBC spoke to a British
04:56.580 - 05:01.480:  resident in Marrakesh, Peter Mercer. There's a lot of military involvement, helicopters flying
05:01.480 - 05:06.100:  up to the mountains from bases around here, assisting with that, but there's a lot of rubble that
05:06.100 - 05:11.440:  needs to be moved from what I understand in these villages, where the poems are often built from
05:11.860 - 05:15.680:  mud and so on, so they're not strong or perhaps don't have good foundations, which is why they've
05:15.680 - 05:21.460:  suffered the most damage. Richard, tell us more about how people in the area are going to cope.
05:21.920 - 05:26.640:  Well, one of the problems is that high up in the Atlas mountains, they're still snow-capped,
05:26.640 - 05:32.400:  so when the sun goes down it gets incredibly cold very, very quickly. There are a few houses that
05:32.400 - 05:37.580:  are still standing, but people are afraid of going back into those ones in case they collapse again,
05:37.800 - 05:44.700:  and we've heard from the president of the local municipality known as Azni, his name's Jamal Imharani,
05:44.700 - 05:49.520:  and he said that the authorities are providing tents for people to sleep in.
05:49.760 - 05:55.980:  It's our local authorities and our leader and our premier minister, they do a lot of
05:55.980 - 06:02.540:  efforts to send tents to make the camps to the people tonight. Our state's working very hard with
06:02.540 - 06:08.380:  also organizations to help to sneak camps for the people where they can stay tonight. We will do
06:08.380 - 06:14.700:  our best that's happening tonight. Jamal Imharani of the Azni commune, and how does this earthquake
06:14.700 - 06:21.520:  compare to the last big one? So the last big one was in Agadir in 1960, and this one was stronger,
06:22.140 - 06:27.920:  the one in 1960 was 5.8 on the Richter scale, but it was shallower and the epicenter was right in
06:27.920 - 06:33.520:  the city, so more than 12,000 people died in Agadir and it had to be completely rebuilt.
06:34.040 - 06:39.600:  Our Africa Regional Editor, Richard Hamilton. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was always going to be a
06:39.600 - 06:45.480:  difficult subject for the G20 group of the world's richest nations to agree on, and so it proved
06:45.480 - 06:50.100:  when it came to the wording of their joint declaration at the summit in the Indian capital, Delhi.
06:50.680 - 06:56.460:  The statement talks about human suffering in Ukraine, but there was no explicit condemnation of
06:56.460 - 07:03.500:  Russia, which along with China is a member of the G20. The communique instead calls on all states
07:03.500 - 07:09.220:  to refrain from the threat or use of force for quote territorial acquisition. Other issues,
07:09.220 - 07:14.540:  such as climate change and food insecurity, were also discussed, but India's foreign minister,
07:14.540 - 07:18.920:  S. Jai Shankar, said Ukraine had taken up much of the focus.
07:19.560 - 07:26.440:  They developed on the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the impact it has had, especially on developing
07:26.440 - 07:32.280:  and least developing nations, still recovering from the pandemic and economic disruption.
07:32.920 - 07:39.160:  Ukraine has criticised the declaration, but the G20 host India was always determined to secure
07:39.160 - 07:43.640:  some kind of agreement, as I heard from our South Asia correspondent Yuga Tula Mai.
07:44.100 - 07:49.460:  I think India was hoping that there would be a joint declaration issued at the end of the summit,
07:49.460 - 07:54.580:  and I think in that sense it's been a success because not only has that declaration actually come,
07:54.580 - 07:59.960:  it also came much earlier than anyone had expected. So I think after what happened at the G20
07:59.960 - 08:05.400:  Bali summit, where the war in Ukraine was a major sticking point and it took a long time for
08:05.400 - 08:10.940:  all parties involved to agree on the wording, I think a lot of work had been started before
08:10.940 - 08:15.360:  the meetings actually began in Delhi to arrive at a consensus. We also heard,
08:15.360 - 08:19.860:  India's foreign affairs minister, S. Jai Shankar, saying that it was actually developing countries
08:19.860 - 08:24.280:  that took the initiative to get to that wording. And of course, when you read the paragraph
08:24.280 - 08:28.860:  about the war in Ukraine, the one thing that stands out immediately is that there is no mention
08:28.860 - 08:35.000:  of Russia, the Russian Federation, or Moscow, the language has been substantially watered down
08:35.000 - 08:36.520:  from the Bali declaration.
08:36.860 - 08:40.040:  Does this signal a loss of support for the Ukrainians?
08:40.220 - 08:46.100:  I think the Ukrainians, as they've already said, are pretty disappointed with the wording,
08:46.100 - 08:50.400:  because in Bali last year, countries couldn't actually come on an agreement,
08:50.400 - 08:55.540:  so the paragraph was heavily caviated, but it did talk about many countries strongly
08:55.540 - 09:02.240:  deploring what they described as a Russian aggression in Ukraine. In this one, it's quite a
09:02.240 - 09:07.060:  surface level which says no member state should be violating the territorial integrity it should
09:07.060 - 09:12.000:  adhere to the UN charter. It does talk pretty strongly about nuclear weapons, saying even the threat
09:12.000 - 09:18.920:  of use and the use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. Ukraine will definitely see that as a disappointment
09:18.920 - 09:23.560:  to them. They are certainly going to wonder about global support for them.
09:23.940 - 09:26.440:  And what else has come out from the summit today?
09:26.740 - 09:32.240:  I think one of the big headlines that has come out of this summit is the inclusion of the African
09:32.240 - 09:37.580:  Union as a permanent member of the G20. It's something that India and India's Prime Minister
09:37.580 - 09:43.040:  Indra Modi had been very strongly advocating for. They're saying that multilateral groupings of
09:43.040 - 09:49.320:  countries that these need to be truly representative and fair, and that's why Prime Minister Modi in
09:49.320 - 09:53.900:  June, in fact, had written a letter to the G20 saying that the African Union must be included,
09:53.900 - 09:57.720:  and that happened today, so that's going to be a big win for India.
09:58.140 - 10:04.560:  Yorwitalamai in Delhi. At least three people have been killed after a ceasefire at a Palestinian
10:04.560 - 10:11.180:  refugee camp in Lebanon fell apart in less than 24 hours. Iron El Hellware near SIDON,
10:11.180 - 10:16.700:  which is home to more than 50,000 people, had seen days of deadly clashes back in July.
10:17.520 - 10:23.920:  Hundreds of people fled when fighting flared up again on Thursday. A brief ceasefire brought
10:23.920 - 10:29.000:  relative calm on Friday night, but it was broken again on Saturday. Our Arab affairs editor
10:29.000 - 10:34.100:  Sebastian Asha explains the background to the latest violence. Essentially, it's a standoff
10:34.100 - 10:40.640:  between FATTA, which is a main official Palestinian faction. President Mahmoud Abbas is the head of it.
10:40.640 - 10:46.620:  It runs the occupied West Bank from Ramallah, and it controls supposedly the camps in Lebanon.
10:46.960 - 10:54.620:  It's facing off challenges from Islamist militants of various militias that came to a head back in
10:54.620 - 11:00.680:  July, which set that violence off with a series of killings. The first killing was of one of these
11:00.900 - 11:06.700:  Islamist militants that then led to an ambush by the Islamist militants who killed five members of
11:06.700 - 11:12.660:  FATTA, including a senior leader. The issue that hasn't gone away is that FATTA wants the suspects,
11:12.660 - 11:16.740:  that are eight suspects that they're after, and at the moment these Islamist groups are refusing
11:16.740 - 11:21.540:  to hand them over, and I think there was no way that the ceasefire was going to alter that equation
11:21.540 - 11:28.260:  and suddenly bring calm. There's plenty of parties who are trying to arrange a ceasefire again
11:28.260 - 11:32.160:  or to calm the situation down as we've seen many times before. I mean, this is a very
11:32.160 - 11:37.480:  restive camp. There's been trouble over the years. There's essentially been a struggle for power,
11:37.480 - 11:43.600:  and that struggle for power has got fiercer in recent months. This showdown isn't really going to end
11:43.600 - 11:48.760:  until these militants who are suspected of the killing of a senior FATTA leader are handed over.
11:48.760 - 11:53.260:  I don't think FATTA is going to back down on this. Ahara Buffet is editor Sebastian Asha.
11:53.960 - 11:58.960:  Conspiracy theories about viruses and vaccines have exploded in recent years.
11:58.960 - 12:05.260:  At the same time, something arguably stranger has spiraled. Our health and disinformation reporter,
12:05.260 - 12:11.540:  Rachel Shreya, has been investigating the rise of germ deniers. In South Africa, a small group
12:11.540 - 12:18.480:  influenced by US conspiracy theorists is awakening painful memories. I've called them kind of the
12:18.480 - 12:24.840:  flatterthers of biology because similar to flatter, we can, you know, show pictures of the earth
12:24.840 - 12:32.940:  being round and people will still deny it. Dan Wilson has a PhD in molecular biology and a YouTube
12:32.940 - 12:38.920:  channel where he debunks health misinformation. Along with more common beliefs, he's seen a growth
12:38.920 - 12:45.700:  in groups online who don't believe germs, which cause disease, exist at all. They believe this
12:45.760 - 12:53.120:  in the face of centuries of evidence. We can take the virus and take it and infect animals with it,
12:53.120 - 12:58.700:  make it sick, and we can also find that same genetic sequence in humans. The germ denial conversation
12:58.700 - 13:05.540:  hardly existed online before 2020 and grew with the start of the COVID pandemic, but it didn't stop
13:05.540 - 13:12.300:  there. It kept growing with higher numbers in 2023 than we saw in the previous three years.
13:12.980 - 13:19.440:  I've been interested in alternative health for many, many years and then of course what happened
13:19.440 - 13:26.700:  with the coronavirus really just sparked another level of my interest. Veronica from near Cape Town
13:26.700 - 13:35.800:  in South Africa is a typical convert. She moved in wellness circles and already had an interest in
13:35.800 - 13:43.100:  health remedies a step away from so-called mainstream medicine. But the pandemic awakened a
13:43.100 - 13:50.220:  deeper mistrust in her and drove her down some information rabbit holes within niche social media
13:50.220 - 13:56.400:  messaging groups. Eventually she found something that denied the very foundations of modern medicine.
13:57.160 - 14:01.680:  I think the whole idea of infectious diseases that you can catch from someone else is an absolute
14:01.680 - 14:08.920:  mist that's been perpetuated for many, many decades on humanity if not centuries. Instead, she thinks
14:08.920 - 14:15.860:  disease is caused by unspecified foreign particles entering the body from toxins in the atmosphere
14:16.300 - 14:21.480:  or eating the wrong foods, though she accepts she doesn't have any evidence for what these
14:21.480 - 14:27.440:  particles might be. Now she's training to be a naturopath, someone who offers alternative
14:27.440 - 14:33.020:  health advice and treatment. I would absolutely tell all of my clients your health is in your
14:33.020 - 14:41.340:  hands, not in your doctor's hands. This is where germ denial comes home to roost because the belief
14:41.340 - 14:48.080:  goes hand in hand with a refusal of medicines and vaccines. Has Dan Wilson points out?
14:48.080 - 14:55.520:  The germ theory denial and anti-vaccine crowds definitely have a lot of overlap.
14:56.080 - 15:01.940:  In South Africa, where Veronica lives, a small, overlapping group of influencers have
15:01.940 - 15:08.820:  edged tools something with a more troubling history. Roberto Pereira was working as an HIV researcher
15:08.820 - 15:15.960:  in Johannesburg during the COVID pandemic. He observed certain influencers who once appeared on the
15:15.960 - 15:22.520:  nightly news to give opposing views on lockdowns, starting to become more radical in their views.
15:42.000 - 15:44.540:  It brings back bad memories for people like Roberto,
15:44.540 - 15:51.740:  who are keenly aware of the very real consequences of HIV denial. In the early 2000s,
15:51.820 - 15:58.420:  South Africa's president, Taba Umbeki, on the basis of bad information, refused to accept the
15:58.420 - 16:04.380:  link between HIV and AIDS and to provide life-saving anti-retroviral drugs.
16:07.860 - 16:14.120:  The outspoken Zulu chief, Mangasutu Boutalazi, has died, a towering figure in South African
16:14.120 - 16:18.840:  politics. He joined the African National Congress as a young man, but broke away,
16:18.840 - 16:25.300:  forming the Zulu in Carter Party in 1975. People in Johannesburg gave their reaction to his death.
16:25.800 - 16:29.800:  It's very sad because he was one of the forefront leaders to defeat the upper day.
16:29.940 - 16:34.180:  It's very shocking and sad. We know and understand his age, but we all said, yeah.
16:34.300 - 16:39.740:  I know that he was the leader of the IFD in Carter Freedom Party, and he was also involved in the
16:39.740 - 16:43.400:  kingdom of Poaziru Natal, so he's a fallen hero.
16:43.920 - 16:49.420:  My South African colleague, Audrey Brown, spoke to Paul Henley about the impact of Mr. Boutalazi.
16:50.060 - 16:55.660:  I think he was a very important figure in 20th century South African history, both during the
16:55.660 - 17:00.700:  period before the democratic breakthrough in 1994 when Nelson Mandela became the first
17:00.700 - 17:06.980:  democratically elected president in the country, and subsequent to that, his role was one could
17:06.980 - 17:12.900:  say ambiguous. On the international stage, he appeared to be fighting the apartheid regime in South
17:12.900 - 17:17.880:  Africa, the white minority regime, and he made all the right noises. Inside the country, though,
17:17.880 - 17:23.420:  he was seen very clearly to be on the side of the apartheid regime. He was seen as a moderate
17:23.920 - 17:29.720:  by right wing forces like Margaret Tatcher, Prime Minister of Britain at the time and Ronald Reagan.
17:29.720 - 17:37.160:  What they really wanted to do was to destroy the ANC's legitimacy, so they saw him as the acceptable
17:37.160 - 17:42.200:  face of the struggle against apartheid and the struggle for freedom. Pretty recently,
17:42.200 - 17:47.320:  on his 90th birthday, he said he'd made mistakes and he asked forgiveness for them.
17:47.380 - 17:51.000:  Do you think that he's been forgiven as he put it in South Africa now?
17:51.280 - 17:57.180:  I would say, perhaps, yes, because memory softens and there's a younger generation that comes in,
17:57.600 - 18:01.980:  but there are people who remember the thousands of people who were killed at the hands of forces
18:01.980 - 18:08.360:  that he commanded, in Qatar, in Beas they were called at the time. These were men that he could
18:08.360 - 18:16.020:  call on to go into townships in South Africa that would kill pro ANC or opposing forces to him.
18:16.140 - 18:22.240:  He denied it. It won't be easy for South Africans, those that remember and suffered to give him a
18:22.240 - 18:28.020:  free pass as it were. And of course, I think one of these lasting legacies really in South Africa,
18:28.300 - 18:32.880:  because he stands that leaders should speak openly about HIV and AIDS because he's children
18:32.880 - 18:37.780:  died of it. And at the time, people talking about it were at a booth, so he did that openly
18:37.800 - 18:42.380:  and declared it. I think perhaps people would remember him more kindly.
18:43.120 - 18:45.700:  BBC presenter Audrey Brown talking to Paul Henley.
18:49.020 - 18:50.980:  And still to come on the global news podcast?
18:50.980 - 18:55.680:  Before the pandemic, it used to joke the three great enemies of war from home,
18:55.680 - 19:00.260:  the bed, the fridge, and the television, and people who were full victim to one of them.
19:00.740 - 19:05.380:  Could this be why big companies are ordering their staff to stop working from home?
19:15.100 - 19:20.140:  For three and a half days, he was the most wanted man in Britain. But Daniel Caliph is now
19:20.140 - 19:25.140:  back in custody after being caught just a few kilometres away from the prison he broke out of
19:25.140 - 19:30.160:  on Wednesday morning by clinging to the underside of a supply lorry. He was being held in
19:30.160 - 19:35.980:  one's worth jail in London accused of preparing an act of terrorism and collecting information useful
19:35.980 - 19:41.400:  to an enemy state. He denies the charges. Our reporter Ellie Price told me how he was apprehended.
19:42.220 - 19:46.200:  It all started in something that sounded a bit like it was out of a movie. Daniel Caliph
19:46.380 - 19:50.760:  was taking part in his audacious prison break. He strapped himself to the bottom of a delivery
19:50.760 - 19:55.840:  van that whisked him out of one's worth prison. It then disappeared for a few days until they were
19:55.840 - 20:00.760:  sightings last night in Chiswick in West London, which was about eight kilometres or so up from
20:00.760 - 20:07.260:  the prison. This morning, about 20 to 11 British time, he was arrested a few miles on from that,
20:07.260 - 20:12.180:  up in Northorne, along a canal. Now the details surrounding his arrest were far less dramatic than
20:12.180 - 20:17.720:  his original escape. He was basically were told shoved off a push bike by a counterterrorism
20:17.720 - 20:22.360:  police officer in plain clothes who saw him. When he was arrested, we're told he was cooperative
20:22.940 - 20:26.520:  handcuffed and as I say, went away. We're really without any problems. The wider details of
20:26.520 - 20:31.040:  exactly how this happened, well that's very much subject to investigation at the moment. Was he
20:31.040 - 20:35.120:  helped from the inside? Was he helped from the outside? Was he acting alone? These real details we
20:35.120 - 20:39.720:  don't yet know, but to say that the crucial piece of information is that Daniel Khalif back in custody.
20:40.080 - 20:45.320:  Yeah, there was even speculation he'd been helped to escape by a foreign state. What happens next
20:45.320 - 20:50.640:  in this case? Well, as you would imagine, this has obviously been a massive manhunt involving
20:50.640 - 20:55.400:  hundreds of police officers around London trying to find him, but obviously it's raised huge
20:55.400 - 21:00.800:  issues here in the UK and with politicians as much as security chiefs as how this could happen.
21:01.180 - 21:06.540:  It's raised questions of how well our prison services are working here in the UK, whether
21:06.540 - 21:10.700:  they're under staff, whether they're resourced correctly. The British government will launch an
21:10.700 - 21:14.860:  inquiry this week into exactly what happened. We're told there will be a result of that inquiry
21:14.860 - 21:18.720:  by the end of the week. Government clearly trying to look like they're on top of this and learn
21:18.720 - 21:25.020:  lessons. Ellie Price reporting. Counting is continuing in the presidential election in the Maldives.
21:25.020 - 21:30.560:  It's being seen as a two-horse race between the current president, Ebrahim Muhammad Saleh,
21:30.560 - 21:37.580:  who wants to establish closer ties with India and Mohammed Muizu, who has taken an early lead and
21:37.580 - 21:43.280:  who has a history of being close to China. Our South Asia regional editor, Anbar Asan Eti Rajan,
21:43.280 - 21:48.600:  has more on the significance of the vote. It is one of the very hotly contested elections that
21:48.600 - 21:54.120:  are eight candidates in the free, but the main contest seems to be between the incumbent
21:54.120 - 22:01.100:  Mohammed Ebrahim Saleh and his rival Mohammed Muizu. It's a coalition, it's a backing Mr. Muizu
22:01.500 - 22:08.440:  and it is known for being close to China. For many Maldivians there are issues like escalating
22:08.440 - 22:13.500:  cost of living, corruption in the government, youth unemployment and it is a, you know,
22:13.500 - 22:20.460:  small population of about half a million people and only 282,000 eligible voters. But if you look
22:20.460 - 22:25.700:  at in a broader context, what's happening is also what else you see in the South Asian region of
22:26.380 - 22:31.560:  how the two Asian powers are competing for influence in other countries like in Sri Lanka or in
22:31.560 - 22:38.580:  Nepal, the same thing happening in the Maldives. And now Ebrahim Saleh is seen someone is very close
22:38.580 - 22:43.940:  to India, he has reestablished ties with India with which it had the country has very strong
22:43.940 - 22:50.300:  cultural and financial links. Whereas there is also a growing anti-India sentiment within Maldives
22:50.300 - 22:55.380:  and China has also invested hundreds of millions of dollars in building this infrastructure
22:55.380 - 23:00.340:  in a bridges and many apartment blocks. I was there a couple of years ago to see the Chinese
23:01.000 - 23:04.620:  investment. So that is why people see that even though it is a Maldivian election,
23:04.620 - 23:07.760:  it is also seen as the rivalry between India and China.
23:08.240 - 23:14.980:  And Marassan Etirajan. Now to the search for a fungus called Yasagamba, it grows out of the
23:14.980 - 23:20.340:  body of a dead caterpillar and it's an aphrodisiac, which might explain why thousands of people
23:20.340 - 23:26.740:  hike up the mountains in Nepal every year to get their hands on it. Known as the Viagra of the Himalayas,
23:27.120 - 23:32.100:  it sells for a fortune in East Asia. But now the Nepalese government is changing the guidelines
23:32.100 - 23:35.240:  to streamline the trade. Lipika Palem has the details.
23:36.240 - 23:40.400:  In your local grocery store, button mushrooms go for about two dollars a box.
23:40.940 - 23:46.720:  Shitakis cost about twice that and black truffles can run a few hundred dollars per kilogram,
23:46.720 - 23:53.240:  but that's nothing compared to the Himalayan fungus, Yasagamba, that can fetch up to five
23:53.240 - 23:59.180:  thousand dollars a kilo. The host caterpillar buries itself down a couple of inches into the soil.
23:59.760 - 24:04.200:  Meanwhile, the fungus, Yasagamba, lodges itself onto the host's body,
24:04.780 - 24:10.860:  killing it slowly from within, then in the spring it erupts out of the head of the dead caterpillar.
24:11.040 - 24:17.180:  This pink-sized, mummified caterpillar is then picked, dried, preserved, and sold for the price
24:17.180 - 24:23.080:  one would hope to get from selling diamonds or gold. So what makes it so expensive? Well,
24:23.080 - 24:30.480:  it's also known as the Viagra of the Himalayas. Yasagamba means summer plant winter insect in Tibetan,
24:30.480 - 24:36.820:  but it's neither a plant nor an insect and is only found at altitudes above three thousand five
24:36.880 - 24:43.860:  hundred meters. Mentioned in a 15th century Tibetan medicinal text titled An Ocean of Aphrodisiac
24:43.860 - 24:49.840:  Qualities, the fungus is treated by East Asian rich men as a status symbol. So, for example,
24:49.840 - 24:56.020:  when a wealthy businessman in China wants to impress his guests, instead of pulling out a fine,
24:56.020 - 25:02.340:  French vintage bottle of wine, he'd present a rose duck filled with thousands of dollars worth
25:02.820 - 25:08.700:  of Yasagamba. Because it's a valuable, Yasagamba has also led to violence. Men went missing
25:08.700 - 25:13.760:  over disputes while harvesting the fungus and bodies were discovered at the bottom of steep
25:13.760 - 25:19.840:  gorgeous. In May this year, it was reported that three Himalayan Viagra pickers were feared dead
25:19.840 - 25:26.340:  and another twelve were injured after being hit by an avalanche. Now, Nepal's Ministry of Forest
25:26.340 - 25:32.920:  and Environment has taken action to stop what it calls excessive harvest. The Nepalese proposals
25:32.920 - 25:39.760:  include setting a limit of 30 days per person gathering the fungus and the setting up of camps
25:39.760 - 25:47.040:  for the harvesters. Lippaker Palem there. Now, it wasn't so long ago that almost all office meetings
25:47.040 - 25:53.040:  were on Zoom, Teams or Skype as employees were told to work from home during the COVID pandemic.
25:53.820 - 26:00.260:  Many people are still happy with remote working, but big firms want their staff back in the office.
26:00.820 - 26:06.020:  The Lloyd's Banking Group says people must work from the office at least twice a week and have
26:06.020 - 26:11.800:  offered free food as an enticement. Zoom is doing the same with employees who live within 80 kilometers
26:11.800 - 26:17.800:  of an office. So does this spell the beginning of the end of working from home? Julian Warikus
26:17.860 - 26:21.980:  spoke to Nicholas Bloom, professor of economics at Stanford University in California.
26:22.760 - 26:28.760:  We're now in this black phase. Folks are not going back into the office particularly. There was an
26:28.760 - 26:34.120:  enormous surge early in the pandemic. It's been falling, so folks have been slowly returning back.
26:34.120 - 26:38.480:  We've now kind of leveled out. So the last six months through a year, been pretty stable,
26:38.480 - 26:43.900:  looking ahead maybe next year or after I think work from home is going to start to grow again.
26:43.980 - 26:48.960:  That's really been the long run trend as technology improves. More people move to working remotely.
26:49.360 - 26:52.560:  But some companies, I mean the Lloyd's Banking Group here in the UK, for example,
26:52.560 - 26:56.880:  telling its employees they must turn up at the office for at least two days a week,
26:56.880 - 27:01.620:  enticing them to do that. Some are clearly skeptical about this, aren't they?
27:01.740 - 27:07.320:  What we see overall is pretty much all big companies are requiring managers, professionals back,
27:07.440 - 27:11.860:  but it's typically three days a week, sometimes four, sometimes it's littlest two.
27:12.560 - 27:16.760:  That seems to have stabilized and interesting enough. They don't get reported as much,
27:16.760 - 27:20.880:  but I talk to a lot of smaller companies that are starting to let some employees go fully
27:20.880 - 27:25.240:  distributed. They're saying, you know, it's expensive having an office. These folks are really only
27:25.240 - 27:29.500:  coming in one day a week. Why don't we just let them be fully remote, save a lot of money with
27:29.500 - 27:34.340:  that office space? The other thing you have to look at is some of the back office operations. So
27:34.340 - 27:39.940:  take Lloyd's or Amazon or Zoom. Sure, managers professionals may be coming in two, three days a week,
27:40.440 - 27:45.480:  but often they're saying things like call centers, data entry, HR, some IT support.
27:46.280 - 27:49.980:  These folks are a lot cheaper to be fully remote and you don't need office,
27:49.980 - 27:54.220:  but you can also hire people internationally. If you're sat in North America,
27:54.220 - 27:58.900:  it can be far cheaper to hire, you know, part of your IT team in Brazil, some in India,
27:59.320 - 28:04.420:  Nigeria. So what we tend to see in big companies is things going in post directions, you know.
28:05.100 - 28:10.600:  What's it doing for productivity or is it too early to say that? There's two very different
28:10.780 - 28:16.540:  stories. One is hybrid, the classic hybrid, you know, the vanilla flavor is in the office,
28:16.860 - 28:20.860:  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, work from home Monday, Friday. That looks like it's about
28:20.860 - 28:25.300:  flatten productivity. On the positives, you don't have to commute twice a week and that's pretty
28:25.300 - 28:30.160:  tiring and it's generally quieter at home, but then of course you get less space time. You may
28:30.160 - 28:34.960:  ask why would anyone do hybrid and the reason is it is popular with employees, it makes it easier
28:34.960 - 28:41.300:  to recruit and retain staff. The other flavor is fully remote where you work from home five days
28:41.300 - 28:47.340:  a week, we can account. That looks like it maybe reduces productivity by about 10%. There's a number
28:47.340 - 28:51.520:  of studies on this now. That's interesting and what's that about? Is that simply because if you're
28:51.520 - 28:56.160:  at home and nobody's with you, you can go off and do something else for a few moments or you don't
28:56.160 - 29:01.240:  feel the same appetite for it because you're not with colleagues? One story is definitely what's
29:01.240 - 29:06.220:  often called self-motivation. Before the pandemic, if you used to joke, the three great enemies of
29:06.220 - 29:11.100:  work from home with the bed, the fridge, and the television, and people would fall victim to one
29:11.100 - 29:14.920:  of them. I think that's definitely a thing, you know, I teach a lot of students at Stanford,
29:14.920 - 29:19.380:  and many of them do go into the library because they feel like it's going to make me work harder.
29:19.900 - 29:24.240:  Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University in California.
29:24.820 - 29:30.160:  Louis Garell has been a star of French cinema for 20 years. At the age of 40, he's
29:30.160 - 29:36.360:  directed his third feature film, The Innocent, which he describes as a half-film noir and half
29:36.360 - 29:42.080:  rom-com. But he says he's worried that French filmmakers may be losing their ability to produce
29:42.080 - 29:46.440:  blockbusters with global appeal. Vincent Dowd has been talking to him.
29:47.040 - 29:52.400:  Hello, I'm Louis Garell. I'm the director and the actor of The Film The Innocent.
29:56.600 - 30:02.980:  From an acting family, Louis Garell first appeared on film aged 6. At 19, he acted in Benardo
30:02.980 - 30:09.820:  Betelucci's controversial The Dreamers. Hitting 40 in France, he's now busy as an actor and director.
30:09.820 - 30:16.080:  The heist movie The Innocent was his idea. First desire was to make like a very French
30:16.080 - 30:20.400:  noir. Like a thriller and also like a rom-com. So I wanted to mix different genres.
30:20.700 - 30:27.600:  When you write the noir film, you have the risky stuff. It's to try to imitate Michael Man, for
30:27.600 - 30:32.400:  example, because for a noir movie, you have an action scene. If you're not aware of this risk,
30:32.400 - 30:36.680:  you can do like a American imitation. Then I said to myself and to the screenwriter,
30:36.680 - 30:41.620:  Oscar, we are French. So we have to inject lots of love in the action scene of The Film.
30:41.720 - 30:46.920:  But when he's working on a screenplay, does Louis Garell think about how well a French story
30:46.920 - 30:51.000:  will play elsewhere? All the time, because there is still where
30:51.000 - 30:55.920:  being French. So there is a way of being two French with comic references inside the country
30:55.920 - 31:00.340:  where an English guy can get the jokes. But there is a good way to be like super French,
31:00.340 - 31:04.920:  to be interesting for an English guy. So it's a very small frontier, because most of the time
31:04.920 - 31:09.880:  is the sense of humor that I'm trying to make trip. I would say the French sense of humour and
31:09.880 - 31:14.180:  the British sense of humour are quite different. Totally different. I'm Josephine March.
31:17.540 - 31:21.180:  Four years ago, Louis Garell appeared in the American film Little Women.
31:21.260 - 31:27.880:  Pre-Barbie director Greta Gerwig was so keen to cast him, she changed his character from German
31:27.880 - 31:33.240:  to French. Making a Hollywood film in English didn't feel very different, which he credits
31:33.240 - 31:39.040:  to Gerwig's intelligence as a director. Because Greta is completely fascinated by the European
31:39.040 - 31:43.700:  cinema, so there was no difference, because she's very concentrated about the actors and the
31:43.700 - 31:48.320:  acting. The thing that I loved was Greta that she was super concentrated and I felt that she was
31:48.320 - 31:52.900:  listening what I was doing. This is a beautiful instrument. Which one of you plays?
31:53.560 - 31:58.120:  It was my sister Beth. It is very hard to lose a sister. I'm sorry.
32:00.240 - 32:04.100:  Some directors, as long as the actors are standing there and are saying their lines,
32:04.300 - 32:08.940:  they're happy, which kind of director are you? Most of the time I'm working with the actors,
32:08.940 - 32:14.300:  because this is the part of making a movie that I'm obsessed about. Do you know what? Sometimes
32:14.300 - 32:20.360:  when a director has a style who is very strong, his films can be very good even if the actors
32:20.360 - 32:30.020:  are not so good. There is no method that there is no general law. Louis Garell recently appeared
32:30.020 - 32:36.580:  in the Three Musketeers, an expensive two-part attempt to make a popular French hit for a world
32:36.580 - 32:42.300:  audience, but for now the international appeal of earlier films such as Amelie or the artist
32:42.300 - 32:48.360:  seems to be evading French filmmakers. Every two or three years we'd have a film like Amelie.
32:48.440 - 32:52.640:  There will be a huge French film internationally, but it doesn't seem to happen now.
32:52.760 - 32:56.080:  This is also what Dimitres Rassam, who's a producer of the Three Musketeers,
32:56.080 - 33:02.300:  tried to reactivate, to create some French blackbuster who have an international life.
33:02.580 - 33:08.180:  But I agree with you. We need to have big movies who are entertaining and super easy to watch
33:08.180 - 33:13.660:  and also very good qualities, of course. I'm always dreaming as an actor and also as a director
33:13.660 - 33:19.940:  to be honest to make a movie who is who has this kind of quality, but it's also very appeals
33:19.940 - 33:23.860:  for a large audience. Louis Garell talking to Vincent Dowd.
33:26.500 - 33:30.520:  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
33:30.520 - 33:35.580:  This edition was mixed by Alana Bowles and produced by Emma Joseph. Our editor is Karen Martin.
33:35.580 - 33:37.920:  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
