*01:00.280- 01:04.260* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*01:04.520- 01:06.920* :  They charge you a lot. We charge you a little.
*01:07.240- 01:10.840* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*01:10.840- 01:14.640* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*01:14.920- 01:19.900* :  That's right. We're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

*02:02.580- 02:04.140* :  one for women and one for men.
*02:04.740- 02:07.960* :  And that morning there had been a significant aftershock.
*02:08.340- 02:12.500* :  And the British comedian Russell Brand is accused of rape, sexual assaults,
*02:12.620- 02:15.320* :  and emotional abuse at the height of his fame.
*02:17.980- 02:19.200* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:19.200- 02:23.040* :  Ukraine tries to create a safe corridor through the Black Sea for ships,
*02:23.040- 02:25.240* :  taking its farm produce to the world.
*02:25.800- 02:29.760* :  And protests around the world at the killing a year ago of an Iranian woman,
*02:29.760- 02:33.660* :  Masa Amini, for apparently refusing to wear a headscarf.
*02:33.960- 02:36.700* :  I believe that Iranian people, they never lose hope.
*02:36.760- 02:39.300* :  They actually lost everything but not hope.
*02:39.360- 02:40.580* :  They want to end this regime.
*02:40.620- 02:43.420* :  We need a global rally against dictatorship.
*02:46.220- 02:51.400* :  A week after floods devastated large parts of the Eastern Libyan city of Dernar,
*02:51.400- 02:54.200* :  survivors have expressed their fury at government leaders,
*02:54.620- 02:59.120* :  accusing them of failing to save thousands of people who died after two dams failed.
*02:59.760- 03:02.620* :  But the international relief effort is now getting underway.
*03:02.620- 03:07.680* :  An Italian naval ship has arrived with tents, blankets, water pumps and tractors.
*03:08.100- 03:12.560* :  And the World Health Organization said enough supplies for a quarter of a million people
*03:12.560- 03:16.480* :  arrived in Benghazi, almost 250 kilometers away.
*03:16.960- 03:20.900* :  Aid flights have also come in from Russia, Romania, and Saudi Arabia.
*03:21.280- 03:24.960* :  Our correspondent Anna Foster sent this report from Dernar.
*03:26.660- 03:29.760* :  A bustling city, now a wasteland.
*03:30.220- 03:34.440* :  The destructive power of water has ripped the heart from Dernar.
*03:35.320- 03:38.400* :  Its survivors left racked with grief and anger.
*03:41.080- 03:43.320* :  We were told to stay inside our homes.
*03:43.700- 03:43.940* :  Why?
*03:44.580- 03:48.160* :  They should have told us there was a storm, told us the dam was old and crumbling.
*03:48.840- 03:51.760* :  Some of these destroyed buildings were 100 years old.
*03:54.100- 03:57.900* :  Ferris Gasar lost five members of his family in the raging current.
*03:58.740- 04:00.700* :  One was his 10-month-old daughter.
*04:01.220- 04:06.360* :  He shows me their pictures, first alive, and then their bodies.
*04:07.160- 04:08.460* :  This was what brought him here.
*04:08.860- 04:14.000* :  A convoy of ministers from the Eastern government, one of Libya's two opposing authorities.
*04:15.280- 04:17.900* :  Fighting has decimated the country's infrastructure.
*04:18.860- 04:20.760* :  Ferris says it's proved fatal.
*04:21.220- 04:24.000* :  I spoke to the Eastern Prime Minister Osama Hamad.
*04:24.200- 04:27.780* :  How could this happen when the dams were supposed to keep people safe?
*04:28.180- 04:31.520* :  It was a very strong cyclone, he told me.
*04:31.940- 04:33.420* :  Too strong for the dams.
*04:34.020- 04:36.940* :  Here in the centre of Dernar, the destruction is total.
*04:36.940- 04:38.620* :  And when you look down this valley,
*04:39.040- 04:43.040* :  at an area that used to be filled with apartment buildings, homes, cars,
*04:43.800- 04:47.080* :  thousands of people with lives that have all been picked up
*04:47.420- 04:51.700* :  and swept out to sea, you wonder how a city like this can ever recover.
*04:52.780- 04:56.460* :  Down at the port, Dernar's dead are still returning to the city.
*04:57.180- 04:59.980* :  Recovery teams watch the waves and wait for them.
*05:01.880- 05:04.840* :  This morning, three more bodies were pulled from the debris,
*05:05.140- 05:09.820* :  but thousands of others swept far from here will never come home.
*05:11.220- 05:12.860* :  Anna Foster in Dernar.
*05:13.500- 05:18.020* :  Rana Kassafi, the Deputy Chief of Mission for the UN Refugee Agency,
*05:18.020- 05:21.760* :  the UNHCR in Libya is also in Dernar.
*05:21.880- 05:23.700* :  She spoke to James Kummer-Sami.
*05:24.260- 05:25.640* :  It's horrific scenes.
*05:25.640- 05:27.900* :  I really haven't seen anything like this.
*05:27.920- 05:29.500* :  I'm not even sure I can explain it.
*05:29.500- 05:34.240* :  You already see the impact of Storm Daniel on your way to Dernar.
*05:34.380- 05:36.460* :  It took us over eight hours from Benarazi.
*05:36.460- 05:38.360* :  This is usually a four-hour drive.
*05:38.900- 05:40.520* :  You can see the road split in half.
*05:40.520- 05:42.980* :  I saw massive rocks and when I asked my colleagues,
*05:42.980- 05:46.760* :  they explained that they were coming from the neighboring mountain to the coastal areas.
*05:46.760- 05:49.160* :  These rocks have demolished and destroyed homes.
*05:49.500- 05:52.720* :  When I got to Dernar, we specifically went to the old city.
*05:52.720- 05:56.580* :  I saw shops and homes that were flattened.
*05:56.720- 05:59.500* :  I've even seen shops that were submerged in the mud
*05:59.500- 06:02.460* :  and you could tell how high the mud had reached.
*06:02.460- 06:05.140* :  It is really, really a very horrific scene
*06:05.140- 06:07.760* :  and the impact I can't explain it.
*06:08.200- 06:10.100* :  What are the rescue operations?
*06:10.660- 06:14.680* :  We saw all kinds of different search and rescue teams.
*06:14.680- 06:17.720* :  I know that there have been different countries from Europe
*06:17.720- 06:21.040* :  and the region in the Middle East and North Africa have sent their teams.
*06:21.680- 06:23.940* :  They are now focusing on search and rescue.
*06:23.940- 06:28.200* :  I've heard of stories of individuals who were rescued alive under the rubble.
*06:28.200- 06:32.260* :  Don't forget, this is the sixth or seventh day since the storm hit last Sunday.
*06:32.840- 06:34.940* :  This is the number one priority right now.
*06:34.940- 06:38.500* :  In addition to extracting the deceased and the corpses
*06:38.500- 06:41.180* :  that have now been washed away into the sea
*06:41.320- 06:42.960* :  or are buried under the rubble,
*06:43.000- 06:44.300* :  so body bags are needed.
*06:44.300- 06:46.640* :  Additional search and rescue teams are needed.
*06:47.240- 06:48.680* :  Time is off the essence, obviously,
*06:48.680- 06:51.500* :  because every second counts in the lives of those individuals
*06:51.500- 06:53.180* :  who remain alive under the rubble.
*06:53.320- 06:55.120* :  People are still being pulled out alive.
*06:55.120- 06:57.940* :  It's miraculous as the locals are saying.
*06:57.940- 06:59.560* :  It's giving them some sense of hope.
*07:00.040- 07:03.260* :  It goes without saying that the levels of shock and trauma
*07:03.260- 07:06.120* :  and fear and panic amongst the local residents
*07:06.120- 07:10.100* :  in the neighboring cities that were affected by the storm is massive.
*07:10.340- 07:13.840* :  Many families continue to look for their missing family members.
*07:14.020- 07:15.520* :  A lot of them have been split.
*07:15.520- 07:16.960* :  A lot of them have been displaced.
*07:16.960- 07:19.540* :  A lot of them have made their way to the neighboring cities
*07:19.540- 07:21.660* :  to be hosted by their relatives or friends.
*07:22.120- 07:25.280* :  Rana Kasefi from the UNHCR.
*07:26.380- 07:27.840* :  Staying in North Africa,
*07:27.840- 07:31.460* :  it's just over a week since a devastating earthquake struck Morocco
*07:31.480- 07:33.960* :  killing nearly 3,000 people.
*07:34.420- 07:36.400* :  Some villages in the Atlas Mountains,
*07:36.400- 07:38.060* :  the epicenter of the quake,
*07:38.520- 07:41.520* :  have also been venting their frustration at the lack of help
*07:41.520- 07:42.340* :  from the authorities.
*07:43.020- 07:44.920* :  Africa, regional editor Richard Hamilton,
*07:44.920- 07:47.720* :  has been finding out more from a British aid worker
*07:48.080- 07:49.980* :  who's been trying to get help to people there.
*07:50.580- 07:52.460* :  Ella Williams is a British student
*07:52.500- 07:56.000* :  who's been conducting field research in the Atlas Mountains
*07:56.020- 07:58.800* :  for her PhD on girls' education.
*07:59.460- 08:02.000* :  Last Saturday morning, while back in the UK,
*08:02.020- 08:05.560* :  she received a desperate phone call from one of her friends.
*08:05.820- 08:08.900* :  Naima told her she was trapped in the rubble
*08:08.900- 08:10.660* :  in her village, Tagrantaft,
*08:11.020- 08:14.720* :  and that her mother, father, brothers and sisters had all died
*08:14.720- 08:16.460* :  when their house collapsed.
*08:16.880- 08:18.980* :  Ella tried to get a military helicopter
*08:18.980- 08:21.760* :  to locate Naima but without success.
*08:22.500- 08:24.360* :  Ella also works for a charity,
*08:24.360- 08:26.300* :  the British Moroccan Society,
*08:26.700- 08:29.640* :  so she flew out to Marrakesh and on Thursday,
*08:29.640- 08:31.920* :  delivered supplies to two villages.
*08:32.640- 08:36.920* :  The entire village of Ahashi is completely destroyed.
*08:36.920- 08:42.780* :  It's one single pile of rubble and the smell of the animals
*08:42.780- 08:46.900* :  that died underneath the rubble was quite overpowering.
*08:47.540- 08:50.480* :  But the thing that's for me just touched me the most
*08:50.620- 08:53.960* :  and brought this to my eyes is that despite everything,
*08:53.960- 08:56.840* :  the villagers welcomed us with ask you for dates,
*08:56.840- 08:59.460* :  which is traditional burba soup,
*08:59.760- 09:01.500* :  and they cooked that in darkness
*09:01.500- 09:03.920* :  because they hadn't got any light up there.
*09:04.200- 09:08.340* :  So despite everything Moroccan hospitality is continuing
*09:08.340- 09:10.320* :  and that was a really special moment.
*09:10.860- 09:14.480* :  She walked back to another village where she slept in a tent,
*09:14.540- 09:16.300* :  but it was a troubled night.
*09:16.940- 09:18.980* :  There's 40 people left in that village
*09:19.060- 09:21.080* :  and they're sleeping between two tents,
*09:21.140- 09:22.700* :  one for women and one for men,
*09:23.280- 09:24.900* :  about 3 a.m. in the morning.
*09:24.900- 09:27.400* :  There was a storm, a wind storm,
*09:27.780- 09:30.420* :  which was very noisy, a sand and dust
*09:30.420- 09:32.800* :  was falling into the tent, rocks were falling.
*09:33.280- 09:36.440* :  And that morning there had been a significant aftershock,
*09:36.440- 09:37.840* :  which was still in people's mind.
*09:37.840- 09:40.700* :  So when all this was happening at 3 a.m. in the morning
*09:40.700- 09:41.860* :  in pitch blackness,
*09:42.380- 09:45.320* :  people were convinced that there was going to be another quake.
*09:45.440- 09:47.800* :  The women in the tent got up and they got together
*09:47.800- 09:51.100* :  and they started reciting the first verse of the Quran.
*09:51.100- 09:54.320* :  They're still living in fear that the earthquake is coming back.
*09:54.860- 09:57.740* :  One of the young women summed up this feeling of trauma
*09:57.740- 09:58.920* :  among the community.
*09:59.640- 10:01.800* :  Even if there is no earthquake, she said,
*10:01.800- 10:04.420* :  the earthquake is always in our minds.
*10:05.180- 10:06.600* :  Just after this interview,
*10:06.940- 10:09.400* :  Ella finally received news of her friend
*10:09.400- 10:11.740* :  who should try so hard to rescue.
*10:12.480- 10:15.200* :  Naima had been found, taken to a hospital,
*10:15.200- 10:17.540* :  but later died from her injuries.
*10:18.320- 10:19.020* :  Richard Hamilton.
*10:20.060- 10:22.700* :  A deal that had allowed Ukraine to export grain
*10:22.700- 10:24.980* :  was abandoned by Russia in July.
*10:24.980- 10:28.520* :  Now though, a temporary corridor is being used to do just that
*10:28.680- 10:29.560* :  and two ships,
*10:29.900- 10:32.480* :  as you to load nearly 20,000 tons of wheat,
*10:32.480- 10:34.740* :  destined for Africa and Asia.
*10:35.160- 10:39.360* :  Meanwhile, Ukraine says it will continue to focus its war efforts on Crimea.
*10:39.740- 10:41.800* :  This after a successful operation
*10:42.200- 10:45.000* :  against the Sevastopol naval base on Wednesday
*10:45.460- 10:46.660* :  and in the wake of questions
*10:46.660- 10:49.160* :  over its use of weapons against the peninsula.
*10:49.160- 10:51.740* :  I spoke to our correspondent Paul Adams.
*10:52.420- 10:53.780* :  Since the middle of July,
*10:53.960- 10:57.480* :  Russia has not been part of the Black Sea grain initiative,
*10:57.480- 11:01.600* :  which was negotiated by the UN and Turkey more than a year ago.
*11:01.940- 11:02.900* :  Now since then,
*11:03.040- 11:08.080* :  there have been attempts to see if vessels can reach Ukrainian ports
*11:08.100- 11:12.200* :  and can leave Ukrainian ports via a temporary corridor,
*11:12.200- 11:14.900* :  which does not rely on Russian cooperation.
*11:15.180- 11:17.920* :  That temporary corridor hugs the Black Sea coast
*11:18.500- 11:20.100* :  close to Romania and Bulgaria.
*11:20.100- 11:22.080* :  And until now,
*11:22.080- 11:27.060* :  all we knew was that about five vessels had managed to leave Ukrainian ports.
*11:27.060- 11:30.380* :  Those were vessels that had been stuck there since the beginning of the war.
*11:30.380- 11:31.660* :  They weren't carrying grain.
*11:32.200- 11:33.760* :  They were carrying other cargoes.
*11:34.000- 11:36.460* :  What we've seen for the first time is that two vessels,
*11:36.460- 11:38.400* :  relatively small bulk carriers,
*11:38.940- 11:41.840* :  are prepared to take the risk of using it,
*11:42.140- 11:44.560* :  that corridor to reach Ukrainian ports
*11:45.040- 11:47.700* :  to load up with wheat and to export that.
*11:47.820- 11:52.360* :  So that is the first time we have seen a movement towards Ukrainian ports
*11:52.820- 11:54.280* :  rather than simply away from them.
*11:54.340- 11:59.680* :  Meanwhile, Ukraine very much defending its right to attack Russian targets in Crimea.
*12:00.220- 12:02.440* :  Yeah, we've seen a lot of activity this past week.
*12:02.440- 12:05.540* :  Obviously, the spectacular raid on Sevastopol,
*12:05.540- 12:07.480* :  on the home of the Black Sea fleet on Wednesday,
*12:08.200- 12:10.960* :  which very substantially damaged two vessels,
*12:10.960- 12:12.780* :  a landing ship and a submarine,
*12:13.460- 12:19.360* :  and caused extensive damage to the important dry dock facility in Sevastopol
*12:19.360- 12:22.200* :  where parts of the Black Sea fleet are maintained and repaired.
*12:22.220- 12:28.300* :  And the following day, an attack on one of Russia's principal air defense systems in Crimea.
*12:28.680- 12:33.040* :  We've been getting more and more details as the week has gone on about that Sevastopol raid.
*12:33.040- 12:36.240* :  With the Ukrainians now saying that a special forces team was involved,
*12:36.240- 12:40.280* :  they inserted themselves using boats onto the Crimean Peninsula.
*12:40.860- 12:44.140* :  They were present at Sevastopol when that missile attack took place.
*12:44.180- 12:50.100* :  So a pretty daring operation involving special forces, cruise missiles, drones,
*12:50.100- 12:53.620* :  these efforts by Ukraine are becoming more and more sophisticated.
*12:54.400- 12:56.560* :  And I think this is a major worry for Russia,
*12:56.560- 13:01.600* :  because Crimea is an absolutely vital integral part of its logistical hinterland
*13:01.600- 13:03.360* :  for its forces in southern Ukraine,
*13:03.360- 13:05.660* :  and is also, as far as Moscow is concerned,
*13:05.660- 13:08.460* :  an absolutely integral part of the Russian Federation.
*13:08.880- 13:10.300* :  Paul Adams in Kiev.
*13:11.300- 13:14.380* :  The President of the European Commission, Ursula Fondolayan,
*13:14.380- 13:20.540* :  will visit the Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday after a surge in the number of migrants arriving there.
*13:20.960- 13:25.580* :  More than 8,000 people have crossed from North Africa on small boats in the past week,
*13:25.940- 13:27.520* :  prompting protests by residents,
*13:27.520- 13:30.480* :  and a plea for help from Italy's Prime Minister,
*13:30.920- 13:33.380* :  is our European regional editor, Danny Aberhardt.
*13:33.840- 13:37.000* :  The number of migrants arriving in Lampedusa this week has been
*13:37.000- 13:41.920* :  in the words of an official from the International Organization for Migration, unprecedented.
*13:42.880- 13:45.140* :  Many have been transferred to Sicily and elsewhere,
*13:45.740- 13:47.380* :  but some 2,500 remain.
*13:48.020- 13:52.520* :  The Italian Red Cross has mounted a colossal effort to meet their basic humanitarian needs,
*13:52.520- 13:55.820* :  and many residents have gone out of their way to welcome the migrants.
*13:56.560- 13:57.620* :  But tensions have risen.
*13:57.620- 14:02.540* :  Other Lampedusa's amounting protests, fearing that a tent city could develop.
*14:05.540- 14:09.900* :  From today, Lampedusa says enough, nobody, nobody anymore.
*14:09.900- 14:13.520* :  This message must be conveyed to both Europe and to the government,
*14:13.520- 14:15.540* :  that the Lampedusa's are tired.
*14:18.260- 14:21.240* :  Yesterday, Italy's right-wing Prime Minister, Georgia Meloni,
*14:21.560- 14:23.560* :  called the situation unsustainable.
*14:24.120- 14:25.580* :  She wants action from the EU,
*14:26.040- 14:28.420* :  including expediting a partnership with Tunisia,
*14:28.800- 14:33.420* :  agreed in outline in July, which includes measures to help tackle irregular migration.
*14:34.180- 14:36.780* :  The European Commission Chief, Ursula von der Leyen,
*14:37.040- 14:40.160* :  has accepted Miss Meloni's invitation to visit Lampedusa.
*14:40.780- 14:43.040* :  Brussels is keen to be seen to be trying to help.
*14:43.680- 14:48.760* :  Miss von der Leyen's likely to back Italy's demands for solidarity from other EU member states.
*14:49.500- 14:52.220* :  But that is a perennial source of tension within the bloc.
*14:52.620- 14:55.380* :  Ultimately, its individual member states will decide.
*14:55.960- 14:57.040* :  Dani Aberhardt.
*14:57.320- 14:57.500* :  Now.
*15:04.880- 15:07.860* :  Women life-freedom, a rallying cry,
*15:07.860- 15:10.480* :  the decode across cities around the world on Saturday.
*15:11.060- 15:12.840* :  From Paris to New York to Tokyo,
*15:12.840- 15:16.800* :  commemorative rallies were held to mark one year since the death in custody
*15:17.320- 15:19.980* :  of the Kurdish Iranian woman, Maasar Aminni.
*15:20.000- 15:23.560* :  She collapsed after being detained by Iran's morality police
*15:23.560- 15:28.820* :  or allegedly not properly wearing her mandatory hijab or head covering.
*15:28.820- 15:32.720* :  A death sparked an uprising led by women and girls,
*15:32.720- 15:36.020* :  driven by demands not just to end the compulsory dress code,
*15:36.540- 15:38.500* :  but for much wider freedoms in Iran.
*15:38.840- 15:40.600* :  The protests were eventually suppressed,
*15:40.600- 15:42.920* :  but not the widespread desire for change.
*15:42.920- 15:47.420* :  Masir Alina Jad is an Iranian women's rights activist.
*15:48.060- 15:50.760* :  I believe that Iranian people never lose hope.
*15:51.420- 15:53.620* :  They actually lost everything but not hope.
*15:53.680- 15:54.920* :  They want to end this regime.
*15:54.920- 15:56.820* :  The next step, I believe,
*15:56.820- 15:59.760* :  that we need a global rally against dictatorship.
*16:00.400- 16:03.100* :  BBC Persians' GR goal has been following events
*16:03.120- 16:07.280* :  and spoke to me earlier from a demonstration here in London's Trafalgar Square.
*16:08.500- 16:10.180* :  Thousands of Iranian diaspora,
*16:10.180- 16:11.660* :  Iranian resident in London,
*16:11.660- 16:13.380* :  in other cities, in the UK,
*16:13.380- 16:17.340* :  came to London in different places in front of Iranian embassy,
*16:17.680- 16:19.040* :  here in the Trafalgar Square,
*16:19.120- 16:20.840* :  and also in front of Downing Street.
*16:21.200- 16:22.400* :  There was many gathering.
*16:22.400- 16:26.620* :  More than 550 were killed in the protests last year.
*16:26.620- 16:30.140* :  Many of the picture of those people were being carried with people.
*16:30.560- 16:31.580* :  And they were shouting,
*16:31.580- 16:36.540* :  United Kingdom should designate Iranian Revolutionary Guards Courts
*16:36.660- 16:38.360* :  as a terrorist organization.
*16:38.680- 16:40.280* :  So many people were shouting,
*16:40.920- 16:41.920* :  women live, free them.
*16:42.240- 16:43.840* :  And many people here,
*16:43.840- 16:46.580* :  they see the Iranian Revolutionary Guards as a tool
*16:46.580- 16:50.480* :  in the hand of Iranian government to suppress the protesters.
*16:51.080- 16:54.560* :  Being in contact with many Iranian activists inside the country,
*16:54.560- 16:58.360* :  particularly in the hometown of Mahsajina Amini,
*16:58.460- 16:59.960* :  in the cities of Saktas,
*17:00.420- 17:03.720* :  someone described the scene just like military zone.
*17:03.720- 17:05.620* :  There are so many armored vehicles,
*17:06.240- 17:09.740* :  special forces covering their face with blood, food,
*17:09.940- 17:12.220* :  and every corner of the streets,
*17:12.220- 17:14.840* :  every squares have been packed with them.
*17:14.840- 17:17.740* :  They try to prevent any gatherings.
*17:17.740- 17:21.320* :  The entire city's shops and bazaar was shut down.
*17:21.320- 17:25.140* :  It was replicated in many cities in the Kurdish region,
*17:25.140- 17:28.980* :  which was the epicenter of protests last year.
*17:29.960- 17:32.160* :  G.R. Goh in London's Trafalgar Square.
*17:34.700- 17:37.180* :  Still to come in the global news podcast.
*17:37.640- 17:39.260* :  That sets me at the end of the conversation.
*17:39.840- 17:40.520* :  I'll see you tomorrow night.
*17:40.560- 17:41.260* :  Amy, love you.
*17:41.260- 17:42.300* :  She said, love you more.
*17:42.300- 17:42.980* :  Put the phone down.
*17:43.020- 17:46.040* :  That was the last thing I ever heard from her.
*17:46.400- 17:48.340* :  Remembering the British music legend,
*17:48.340- 17:51.680* :  Amy Winehouse in the week she would have turned 40.
*18:00.100- 18:04.040* :  The attorney general for the US State of Texas Ken Paxton
*18:04.040- 18:07.460* :  has been cleared by the State Senate of corruption charges
*18:07.900- 18:09.120* :  following an impeachment process.
*18:09.660- 18:11.780* :  Allegations of wrongdoing, which he denied,
*18:11.780- 18:14.920* :  have been hanging over him since he took office nine years ago.
*18:15.340- 18:18.160* :  Like his ally, the former president Donald Trump,
*18:18.160- 18:21.940* :  the Republican claim he was the victim of a political witch hunt
*18:22.300- 18:25.040* :  and said the outcome showed the truth prevailed.
*18:25.360- 18:28.320* :  He still faces a separate state fraud trial.
*18:28.740- 18:31.760* :  I heard more about Mr. Paxton from our North America correspondent,
*18:31.760- 18:32.820* :  David Willis.
*18:33.320- 18:36.880* :  He gained national prominence over his court battles
*18:36.880- 18:39.240* :  with then-president Barack Obama.
*18:39.740- 18:43.940* :  And he also led an effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election
*18:44.060- 18:46.700* :  through a lawsuit that was aimed at throwing out
*18:46.700- 18:49.400* :  the electoral college votes of swing states
*18:49.980- 18:52.040* :  that were won by Joe Biden.
*18:52.040- 18:56.240* :  So he represents a particular part of the Republican party,
*18:56.760- 18:57.260* :  if you like.
*18:57.260- 19:01.740* :  He's been suspended without pay since May of this year
*19:01.740- 19:04.580* :  when he was impeached by the lower house
*19:04.580- 19:08.500* :  of the Texas legislature by an overwhelming majority
*19:08.500- 19:12.620* :  over allegations of bribery and abuse of office.
*19:13.020- 19:17.480* :  That was after it emerged that he'd requested more than three million dollars
*19:18.180- 19:21.300* :  in taxpayers' money in order to settle a lawsuit
*19:21.300- 19:24.480* :  with former staff members whom he fired
*19:24.480- 19:27.800* :  after they reported his conduct to the FBI.
*19:27.800- 19:30.520* :  And those whistleblowers accused Ken Paxton
*19:30.520- 19:33.900* :  of doing favors for a local real estate investor
*19:33.980- 19:36.400* :  who donated tens of thousands of dollars
*19:36.400- 19:39.600* :  to Mr. Paxton's political campaign.
*19:39.620- 19:42.940* :  He was impeached, as I said, by the Texas House of Representatives
*19:42.940- 19:46.020* :  but has now been acquitted by the State Senate
*19:46.160- 19:49.640* :  on 16 counts following a two-week trial.
*19:49.640- 19:54.520* :  And this case really has split the Republicans in Texas, hasn't it?
*19:54.700- 19:55.480* :  It very much has.
*19:55.480- 19:58.440* :  There are some Republicans, member of the lower house,
*19:58.620- 20:00.960* :  who continue to maintain Alex,
*20:00.960- 20:04.900* :  that the Attorney General is corrupt and unfit for office
*20:04.900- 20:08.620* :  and that he'd abandoned his obligation to work on behalf,
*20:08.620- 20:12.440* :  if you like, of the interests of the people of Texas.
*20:12.440- 20:16.440* :  The Texas House of Representatives elicited testimony
*20:16.440- 20:20.180* :  from more than a dozen witnesses during that trial
*20:20.180- 20:23.760* :  who were mostly former seniors to Mr. Paxton himself.
*20:23.760- 20:25.420* :  So you're absolutely right.
*20:25.420- 20:28.740* :  This has proved deeply divisive as far as Republicans
*20:28.740- 20:31.340* :  who hold the majority there in Texas are concerned.
*20:31.920- 20:32.640* :  David Willis.
*20:33.580- 20:36.020* :  The British actor and comedian Russell Brand
*20:36.140- 20:38.320* :  has been accused of rape, sexual assault,
*20:38.320- 20:41.160* :  and abusive behavior during a seven-year period.
*20:41.620- 20:43.660* :  The allegations have been made by several women
*20:43.660- 20:45.220* :  following a joint investigation
*20:45.320- 20:48.240* :  by the British media organizations the Times,
*20:48.240- 20:52.100* :  the Sunday Times, and Channel 4's Dispatches program.
*20:52.580- 20:54.260* :  Russell Brand has denied the claims,
*20:54.260- 20:57.300* :  saying all of his past relationships were consensual.
*20:57.700- 21:00.000* :  On Saturday, he performed his one-man show
*21:00.000- 21:02.620* :  to a sell-out crowd at a theatre in London.
*21:03.060- 21:07.400* :  The chair of the House of Commons Culture Committee, Caroline Dinanash,
*21:07.700- 21:10.860* :  has called the allegations very serious and concerning.
*21:10.860- 21:13.520* :  Our correspondent Helena Wilkinson reports.
*21:14.200- 21:17.760* :  The joint investigation says that four women have alleged
*21:17.760- 21:20.700* :  they were sexually assaulted by Russell Brand
*21:20.700- 21:24.120* :  between 2006 and 2013.
*21:24.220- 21:27.340* :  One has accused him of raping her.
*21:27.860- 21:29.960* :  During the years covered by the allegations,
*21:29.960- 21:34.100* :  Russell Brand had various high-profile jobs at different times,
*21:34.880- 21:37.660* :  including at BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4,
*21:38.180- 21:40.380* :  and as an actor in Hollywood films.
*21:41.040- 21:44.580* :  Channel 4's Dispatches program has broadcast testimony
*21:44.580- 21:45.560* :  from the women.
*21:46.200- 21:50.100* :  One woman says Russell Brand attacked her at his home in Los Angeles
*21:50.100- 21:51.740* :  in July 2012.
*21:51.820- 21:54.740* :  Her words are voiced by an actor.
*21:55.240- 21:59.460* :  He's grabbing at my underwear, pulling it to the side.
*21:59.460- 22:02.080* :  I'm telling him to get off me and he won't get off.
*22:03.280- 22:06.660* :  Like holding me up against the wall, pushing himself in me.
*22:08.220- 22:11.540* :  I was like, oh my god, he raped me.
*22:12.540- 22:16.020* :  She says that afterwards, Russell Brand sent her a message saying,
*22:16.020- 22:17.020* :  I'm sorry.
*22:17.760- 22:21.200* :  Another woman has alleged that Russell Brand assaulted her
*22:21.240- 22:23.920* :  when she was 16 and still at school,
*22:24.440- 22:25.760* :  and he was 31.
*22:25.820- 22:29.660* :  The Sunday Times has also reported that other women
*22:29.660- 22:33.560* :  have made a range of allegations about his controlling,
*22:33.560- 22:36.380* :  abusive, and predatory behavior.
*22:37.120- 22:38.820* :  In a video released last night,
*22:38.820- 22:41.320* :  before the allegations were made public,
*22:41.860- 22:44.020* :  but after he had been told about them,
*22:44.320- 22:46.380* :  Russell Brand issued this denial.
*22:46.880- 22:49.860* :  These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream,
*22:49.880- 22:51.360* :  when I was in the newspapers all the time,
*22:51.360- 22:52.400* :  when I was in the movies,
*22:52.400- 22:54.780* :  and as I've written about extensively in my books,
*22:55.020- 22:56.600* :  I was very, very promiscuous.
*22:56.800- 22:58.480* :  Now, during that time of promiscuity,
*22:58.480- 23:02.060* :  the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual.
*23:02.120- 23:07.340* :  What I seriously refute are these very, very serious criminal allegations.
*23:08.080- 23:10.820* :  Russell Brand's current agent, Tavistock Wood,
*23:10.820- 23:15.880* :  have told the BBC they have terminated all professional ties with him.
*23:16.600- 23:19.840* :  Russell Brand started his career as a stand-up comedian.
*23:19.840- 23:23.880* :  He went on to host a number of radio and TV programs.
*23:24.640- 23:28.220* :  In a statement tonight, the BBC highlighted the corporation
*23:28.300- 23:29.880* :  took issues seriously,
*23:30.460- 23:32.200* :  and was prepared to act.
*23:32.200- 23:37.000* :  More recently, Russell Brand has turned away from traditional mainstream media
*23:37.400- 23:40.480* :  and currently broadcast a weekday online show.
*23:41.140- 23:45.720* :  In a statement, Channel 4 said it was appalled to learn of what it described
*23:45.720- 23:48.240* :  as deeply troubling allegations,
*23:48.940- 23:52.880* :  including behavior alleged to have taken place on programs
*23:53.540- 23:54.800* :  made for Channel 4.
*23:55.200- 23:56.420* :  Helena Wilkinson.
*23:57.220- 24:00.720* :  The Greek Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis has said his country
*24:00.720- 24:05.120* :  is facing a war during peacetime after experiencing its worst floods
*24:05.400- 24:06.900* :  and fires in its history.
*24:07.240- 24:08.060* :  Here's Tom Bailey.
*24:08.760- 24:13.320* :  In a keynote address, Mr Mitsotakis said the role of the army would be strengthened
*24:13.320- 24:15.460* :  in responding to natural disasters,
*24:15.940- 24:18.840* :  while more funding would be made available for those affected.
*24:19.520- 24:22.080* :  This will be raised by increasing tourist taxes.
*24:22.840- 24:27.480* :  Greece has faced its worst wildfire season, closely followed by severe flooding
*24:27.480- 24:29.680* :  which left 17 people dead.
*24:29.680- 24:33.280* :  The Prime Minister described climate change as the new enemy.
*24:33.280- 24:36.940* :  His government has, though, face criticism over its response
*24:36.960- 24:40.820* :  with many of those affected, saying it was slow and uncoordinated.
*24:41.180- 24:41.980* :  Tom Bailey.
*24:42.760- 24:46.240* :  The remote Arctic Islands of Svalbard in Norway,
*24:46.240- 24:48.540* :  the northernmost settlement in the world,
*24:48.540- 24:52.480* :  have been described as the canary in the coal mine of climate change.
*24:52.520- 24:55.960* :  They're warming twice as fast as other areas of the Arctic
*24:56.460- 24:59.060* :  and five to seven times faster than the rest of the world.
*24:59.660- 25:03.560* :  Hilda Fallenstrom lives in the Svalbard capital
*25:03.880- 25:06.060* :  and is the co-founder of Hearts in the Ice,
*25:06.060- 25:08.580* :  which is joining global protests over the weekend
*25:09.040- 25:10.980* :  against the burning of fossil fuels.
*25:10.980- 25:15.700* :  Julian Marshall asked how the climate in Svalbard has changed over the years.
*25:16.440- 25:21.200* :  The temperature they have measured is from 1994 and up till today
*25:21.200- 25:26.980* :  has risen 10 degrees Celsius for the middle temperature during winter.
*25:27.320- 25:29.860* :  It's an extreme situation up in the Arctic
*25:29.980- 25:33.300* :  and, as you know, what's happening in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic
*25:33.300- 25:35.480* :  so it impacts the whole world.
*25:35.580- 25:40.840* :  I've been experienced avalanches, landslides, lots of sea ice,
*25:41.240- 25:42.640* :  decreasing glaciers.
*25:42.960- 25:45.140* :  The whole island is all of a sudden green.
*25:45.140- 25:47.560* :  You see wildlife is struggling.
*25:48.260- 25:49.700* :  It impacts everything, actually.
*25:50.000- 25:53.480* :  You mentioned wildlife there, and of course with that part of the world
*25:53.500- 25:55.680* :  you associate with polar bears.
*25:56.040- 25:57.780* :  Are they having to change their habits?
*25:57.780- 26:03.740* :  Yes. So what we have seen since their main prey seals on top of the sea ice
*26:03.900- 26:06.140* :  when we now have less sea ice,
*26:06.320- 26:09.280* :  they need to try to find other sources for food.
*26:09.480- 26:13.560* :  And what we've seen the last few years is that a few polar bears
*26:13.560- 26:16.920* :  are getting experts in hunting rainders.
*26:17.040- 26:21.520* :  The question the scientists are asking is if this could maybe help you
*26:21.520- 26:24.420* :  of the individuals, but probably not the whole species.
*26:24.680- 26:28.480* :  They're trying to adapt, but the changes are happening so fast.
*26:28.740- 26:34.140* :  And we also see that the polar bear moms are really struggling to keep their cops alive.
*26:34.140- 26:37.820* :  We haven't seen any decrease in the numbers in big range,
*26:37.820- 26:42.300* :  but we do see that they are really having a huge problem
*26:42.640- 26:45.120* :  to bring their cops up to adult age.
*26:45.200- 26:49.300* :  They starve to death during the summer, and usually the first year.
*26:49.700- 26:53.180* :  Is it a better place though for humans to live now, Svalbard?
*26:53.400- 26:54.400* :  That's a good question.
*26:54.460- 27:01.900* :  I think we are adaptable, but it's really a matter of how impactful this region is for the whole world.
*27:02.120- 27:06.220* :  I rather have a cold, powerful Arctic than what it is now.
*27:06.220- 27:08.440* :  It really impacts us too.
*27:08.600- 27:12.660* :  I experienced back in 2015, a life-changing event
*27:12.680- 27:15.200* :  when a navelange came down to the settlement,
*27:15.200- 27:18.080* :  just a few meters from my house.
*27:18.140- 27:20.980* :  This hour launched, destroyed 12 of my neighbor houses,
*27:21.300- 27:24.700* :  and 17 of my neighbors were buried inside their homes.
*27:24.960- 27:28.320* :  I realized that I really wanted to be not only part of the problem,
*27:28.340- 27:29.800* :  but also part of the solution.
*27:30.080- 27:30.880* :  What is the solution?
*27:30.940- 27:35.200* :  Because presumably all this global warming that you are experiencing
*27:35.220- 27:39.600* :  is caused by carbon emissions that are nothing to do with you.
*27:39.980- 27:42.420* :  Well, it actually has something to do with me too,
*27:42.420- 27:45.280* :  because I'm living up in Svalbard. We have coal mining,
*27:45.280- 27:50.900* :  so I encourage everyone to support an energy shift towards renewable energy,
*27:51.280- 27:54.880* :  and say goodbye to fossil fuel and fossil energy.
*27:55.780- 28:02.580* :  Hild Fallen-Stron, the co-founder of the Harts in the ICE program in Svalbard.
*28:03.720- 28:07.880* :  Amy Winehouse, the multi-award-winning and hugely gifted pop star
*28:07.880- 28:10.920* :  of the 2000s, would have turned 40 this week.
*28:11.060- 28:15.260* :  Instead, the British singer died in 2011 at the age of just 27.
*28:15.260- 28:18.340* :  Audrey Brown has been speaking to Dale Davis.
*28:18.660- 28:21.580* :  He was a friend of Amy's and used to be her bassist.
*28:21.900- 28:25.420* :  He now plays in a tribute act called the Amy Winehouse Band.
*28:26.020- 28:31.240* :  I tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no.
*28:31.840- 28:35.440* :  I'd say for the first four years, when I was working with her,
*28:35.920- 28:39.180* :  up until the end of 2007, there were so many great performances
*28:39.820- 28:41.380* :  within two weeks of working with her.
*28:41.380- 28:44.260* :  We did a gig at Notting Hill Carnival, and by the end of the show,
*28:44.260- 28:48.160* :  I thought your performance was so powerful, you didn't need a band there,
*28:48.400- 28:51.760* :  and Notting Hill Carnival was going to be a hard place for a young white girl at the time,
*28:52.140- 28:55.080* :  and halfway through the concert, people just turned up by the end of it.
*28:55.380- 28:57.560* :  It was completely packed in power-squaring.
*28:58.180- 29:02.000* :  She was unbelievable, and at that point, I realised what a great time she was
*29:02.380- 29:03.940* :  and had to look out for her really.
*29:19.300- 29:22.000* :  When we first came out, she was very excited about that.
*29:22.280- 29:25.080* :  She wasn't really a person to boast or anything like that.
*29:25.200- 29:27.080* :  She'd never really big herself up.
*29:27.380- 29:29.620* :  Which musicians did she like to sing?
*29:29.980- 29:31.840* :  I love the Tony Bennett album, by the way.
*29:32.020- 29:34.280* :  Yeah, she's a big fan of Donnie Hatterway,
*29:34.880- 29:36.800* :  we've done a cup of his songs in the set.
*29:37.100- 29:40.180* :  We did a cover of more than 11, we're still friends,
*29:40.180- 29:42.720* :  she recorded as well on a live show.
*29:43.280- 29:46.540* :  She liked her little answer in the Imperials as well.
*29:47.260- 29:48.420* :  She liked a lot of old stuff.
*29:48.660- 29:51.600* :  She loved the specials, obviously, we did the covers with that,
*29:51.960- 29:54.680* :  but she always managed to take a cover and make it sound like herself.
*29:56.060- 29:59.620* :  Tell me about the Amy Winehouse band that you're in now.
*30:00.060- 30:04.060* :  It started in 2016, and the first couple of shows were Strange,
*30:04.240- 30:06.980* :  but then once I started to see the audience reaction
*30:07.080- 30:09.360* :  and how much they wanted to see this,
*30:09.360- 30:11.440* :  then I thought, it's a must really,
*30:11.440- 30:13.800* :  and I do it out of love and respect for Amy as well.
*30:14.520- 30:17.000* :  We saw a lot of each other in the last six months,
*30:17.040- 30:20.240* :  and I just felt that it was important to carry that on.
*30:21.000- 30:23.540* :  You spoke to her the night she died?
*30:23.880- 30:25.680* :  Yes, and I was out with her two nights beforehand,
*30:26.320- 30:29.540* :  so that was quite surreal when I look at the events the following day.
*30:29.980- 30:31.240* :  We were having a nice conversation.
*30:32.020- 30:33.240* :  I was going to see her the following night,
*30:33.540- 30:36.220* :  and I said to her at the end of the conversation,
*30:36.760- 30:38.180* :  I'll see you tomorrow night, Amy, love you.
*30:38.180- 30:39.920* :  She said, love you more, put the phone down.
*30:40.020- 30:42.880* :  That was the last thing I ever heard from her,
*30:43.120- 30:45.440* :  so I feel, you know, it's a very bit sweet thing.
*30:55.380- 30:58.000* :  Dale Davis, who played bass for Amy Winehouse,
*30:58.000- 31:01.420* :  and is currently a member of the Amy Winehouse Band,
*31:01.840- 31:04.240* :  he was speaking to the BBC's Audrey Brown.
*31:07.580- 31:09.780* :  And that's all from us for now,
*31:09.780- 31:13.240* :  but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:13.900- 31:15.880* :  If you want to comment on this podcast,
*31:15.880- 31:17.620* :  or the topics covered in it,
