00:36.040 - 00:41.000:  I'm Janak Jaleel and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 12th of September, these are our main
00:41.000 - 00:47.520:  stories. Moroccan villages hit by last week's devastating earthquake say aid isn't reaching them
00:47.520 - 00:53.800:  quickly enough. Heavy floods triggered by a powerful storm in eastern Libya have killed at least
00:53.840 - 01:00.560:  200 people. Cocaine production in Colombia has climbed to a record level.
01:03.680 - 01:08.620:  Also in this podcast, she became spoiled. The photographer soon discovered that she
01:08.620 - 01:13.380:  were even less obedient than people who were being photographed. The scientist who led the team
01:13.420 - 01:19.860:  that cloned Dolly the sheep, turning her into a media sensation, Professor Ian Wilmot, has died.
01:24.380 - 01:29.500:  We begin in Morocco where there's been criticism of the speed of the official response
01:29.500 - 01:37.200:  to Friday's earthquake, which is now known to have killed more than 2,800 people. Heavy lifting
01:37.200 - 01:42.280:  equipment has begun to arrive in remote regions of the Atlas Mountains, which have been the hardest
01:42.700 - 01:48.720:  hit. But in many areas, villages have been digging with their bare hands through the rubble of
01:48.720 - 01:55.060:  collapsed homes. Mosin Fahler works at a hotel in a village called Mariga in the region. He
01:55.060 - 02:01.540:  described a harrowing scene. We have a cleaning lady called Habibah. She lost 8 members of her
02:01.540 - 02:10.320:  family, including her 70 years old son. There is no home for her. Her house is completely destroyed,
02:10.320 - 02:18.160:  so she's there just in a little tent with the rest of her family waiting to find her son.
02:18.720 - 02:24.560:  Totally horrible feeling. That's someone of your family just buried under the ground.
02:25.220 - 02:31.420:  Everyone just running everywhere and trying to help. It's not just because my family are safe,
02:31.420 - 02:37.740:  so I'm fine. No. All of them are my families. All of my colleagues work with me,
02:37.740 - 02:44.960:  lost someone of the families. I'm sharing the same feelings. I was there when that happened.
02:46.100 - 02:51.620:  A human rights activist in Rabat, Mati Monjib, told the BBC, he thought the Moroccan government
02:51.620 - 02:57.280:  should have been more open to outside help. The authorities and the population are doing
02:57.280 - 03:03.980:  their best, but it is not enough. And because of that, I don't understand why Morocco didn't send
03:03.980 - 03:11.580:  a request for powerful states as France, as the United States, etc. Why did it accept only
03:11.580 - 03:18.460:  some propositions from Spain, Great Britain, Qatar and Emirates? Because when it is concerning
03:18.460 - 03:23.260:  human beings, lives, I don't understand this political considerations.
03:23.340 - 03:28.680:  My colleague James Kummer's army spoke to James Coppnell, who spent the day traveling in the
03:28.680 - 03:34.300:  Atlas Mountains. First, James described what he's been seeing in the city of Marrakesh,
03:34.300 - 03:39.260:  which has also been badly hit by the Quake. One of the first things I noticed in Marrakesh
03:39.260 - 03:44.500:  was the number of people sleeping outside. Even though the earthquake took place on Friday,
03:44.500 - 03:50.180:  they're still too scared to go back indoors. I met one young woman, Bushra, and I asked her why
03:50.180 - 03:56.320:  she'd been sleeping under the stars. I adore Alex's exterior because there was a tremblement
03:56.320 - 04:00.620:  under the air. She says she's still sleeping outside because even though the earthquake happened
04:00.620 - 04:06.140:  three days ago, there's still the trauma from it, and there's just a real fear that something could
04:06.140 - 04:11.160:  happen and it's too dangerous to stay inside, sleep inside. I look at the conditions that
04:11.160 - 04:15.720:  sleeping out here in the night is not great. It's not particularly comfortable. It's cold.
04:15.740 - 04:21.900:  We're trying to comfort each other, but we're also aware that the situation for other people
04:21.900 - 04:24.940:  and parts of the country is much, much worse. We're really happy just to be alive.
04:25.300 - 04:30.080:  Then we left Marrakesh. We headed south into the Atlas Mountains towards the epicenter
04:30.340 - 04:37.120:  of this earthquake. All along the routes, highly climbed into the hills. We saw damaged buildings,
04:37.120 - 04:44.120:  broken buildings, rubble on the road too. Places where the car had to swerve or edge its way past
04:44.260 - 04:51.220:  landfall. Then we found a traffic jam created by just so many people traveling into the mountains
04:51.220 - 04:56.400:  to these remote villages to bring help. Not in this case, the Moroccan state, but ordinary people
04:56.840 - 05:02.540:  loading up their cars with provisions and taking them to their neighbors, their relatives in the
05:02.540 - 05:07.680:  villages, their friends, people they didn't know even, but desperate to help out. So many though
05:07.680 - 05:13.580:  that we got in a traffic jam and then suddenly rocks started falling, shale started falling from
05:13.580 - 05:18.200:  the hillside. There have been aftershocks over the last couple of days. So a real sense of panic,
05:18.200 - 05:22.460:  people jumping out of the cars and moving on. The sense of panic, but also a sense of real
05:22.460 - 05:27.640:  determination that whatever the risks, people really wanted to go and help those, less fortunate
05:27.640 - 05:31.740:  that them who'd been directly caught up in the earthquake. And what about the government? What has
05:31.740 - 05:36.320:  it been saying and how does that compare to what the people you've met have been telling you?
05:36.520 - 05:40.280:  Well look, the government is keen to show the work it is doing. It's been sending helicopters
05:40.280 - 05:46.400:  to remote places. We saw a couple of those overhead today. So a military hospital as well,
05:46.400 - 05:51.120:  a field hospital that's been set up to treat people with broken legs and arms and facial wounds
05:51.120 - 05:56.020:  and trauma as well. But at the same time, we talked to a lot of people who said, look, I haven't
05:56.020 - 06:00.960:  really got much from the government. I've had support, even a tense some food from Moroccan
06:00.960 - 06:07.200:  citizens and I want more from the state. James Coppnell. Well, James cumbersome also spoke to the
06:07.200 - 06:14.320:  Moroccan senator, Larsen Hadad, a former tourism minister. What did he make of the claims that
06:14.320 - 06:19.120:  much of the help reaching the villages worst affected had come from ordinary Moroccans
06:19.120 - 06:25.240:  rather than from the authorities? I think the response has been incredible. I think it was heroic
06:25.240 - 06:31.680:  and when the earthquake happens and because it's in the high Atlas mountains, then most of the roads
06:31.680 - 06:37.120:  become blocked and then some of them are blocked for kilometers and kilometers. The longest one
06:37.120 - 06:44.120:  was blocked for about 26 kilometers. So you need like a herculean effort in order to deal with that
06:44.540 - 06:50.640:  are there still areas which haven't been accessed? The last areas were accessed yesterday,
06:50.700 - 06:58.820:  midday and that's what contributed to the figure of the death toll. It's expected probably to rise
06:58.820 - 07:03.580:  as they go through the rubble and then find out about those villages which are close to the
07:03.580 - 07:09.300:  epicenter. The government has accepted aid from a few countries, hasn't it? The UK being one of
07:09.300 - 07:15.340:  them, Spain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates. There has been concern expressed though by some
07:15.340 - 07:22.500:  that other countries that were ready to offer aid, France and Germany, their aid has not been
07:22.500 - 07:27.680:  accepted. Can you explain the thinking there? I don't think that it has not been accepted.
07:27.700 - 07:33.020:  What the Moroccans are saying, look, we know the terrain, the army knows the terrain because it
07:33.020 - 07:37.860:  has been dealing with the high Atlas. We know how to get to the population, we have the means
07:37.860 - 07:43.320:  now to be able to do that. If we have like something specific where we don't have the expertise,
07:43.920 - 07:47.560:  then we're going to call on our friends. For example, like we said, okay, we need dogs,
07:48.220 - 07:53.280:  train dogs and all of that. We have some, but I think the Spanish have expertise in that and they're
07:53.280 - 07:58.040:  very close by. They could like just come in very quickly and that's what we did with the Spanish.
07:58.340 - 08:04.640:  There's no sense then that geopolitical concerns have played in title. I mean, that's the media
08:04.640 - 08:10.700:  trying to read some sort of geopolitics into that. If I am telling you that only yesterday,
08:10.720 - 08:16.240:  they got to certain communities and can appreciate the fact that they are only taking stock of what
08:16.240 - 08:22.140:  is the law, what happens. But I mean, I think later in each one of those hundreds of communities,
08:22.680 - 08:27.440:  those kinds of camps need to be run, needs to be managed, needs to be provided food, maybe we
08:27.440 - 08:31.740:  need tents, maybe we need people who have expertise in dealing with that. The king has given
08:31.740 - 08:36.700:  instructions that the reconstruction will start right away. I think we need all the possible aid
08:36.700 - 08:41.340:  we can get like from the friends, from the Germans. The accusation from some was the response was
08:41.340 - 08:46.700:  slow and it could have been quicker if there had been more international help. How would you respond
08:46.700 - 08:52.040:  to that? Why if anyone could explain to me how a rock that weighs like 10 tons would have been
08:52.040 - 08:57.820:  quicker to like remove from the road, they need to be my guests. I mean, I think the army engineers
08:57.820 - 09:02.640:  and the army core of the civil protection and the public works. They have all the means and the
09:02.640 - 09:08.060:  machinery. So it's not like we don't have machinery to do that. It's not like we don't have engineers.
09:09.120 - 09:16.120:  That was the Moroccan Senator Larsen Hadad. Further east along the North African coast, a deadly storm
09:16.120 - 09:22.000:  has brought its own trail of destruction to Libya. The port of Dürner has been submerged by
09:22.000 - 09:27.320:  flood water as torrential rain and raging winds ripped through the east of the country,
09:27.320 - 09:33.680:  damaging buildings and homes. The Libyan Red Crescent says at least 200 people have died,
09:33.680 - 09:40.340:  but local authorities have said that the real figure may be much, much higher. Mike Thompson
09:40.340 - 09:46.760:  has been monitoring events in Libya. It's a scene of devastation from what we're hearing. In the
09:46.760 - 09:54.300:  city of Dürner, which is around 240 kilometers east of Benghazi, there are reports of as many
09:54.300 - 10:02.940:  as 2,000 people having died and thousands more missing. Now that is unconfirmed, but that is what
10:02.940 - 10:10.740:  the Prime Minister of Libya's parallel eastern government, Osama Hamad has said. So it has been
10:10.740 - 10:15.500:  growing and growing and growing and of course when you've got such utter chaos which is inevitable
10:15.920 - 10:21.120:  as of course, as we saw in the earthquake in Morocco and here too, when you have this sort of
10:21.120 - 10:26.220:  devastation, it's very hard for people to know what's going on and to know who's missing,
10:26.220 - 10:31.660:  who's died and in fact going back to the comment by the Prime Minister of the eastern Libyan
10:32.220 - 10:37.660:  parliament. I mean he doesn't say what his sources are to arrive at this figure which makes you
10:37.660 - 10:43.360:  wonder how he got them. And what's supposed to happen there is that two dams, the municipality
10:43.360 - 10:52.360:  says two dams have collapsed and four bridges as well and completely swamped that city in water.
10:52.720 - 10:57.600:  And it's not the only place of course right across the the east there that's been devastation
10:57.600 - 11:04.280:  including in Benghazi and several other places too and the floods of course, landslides which
11:04.280 - 11:11.580:  have swept some roads away severely damaged houses and it's led to schools being closed, public
11:11.580 - 11:17.480:  institutions being closed and four major oil terminals as well. But obviously going back to
11:17.480 - 11:23.560:  the most important thing, the loss of life. Now if it is as high as 2,000 people, that is
11:24.520 - 11:27.660:  simply terrible, it's hard to find words for that.
11:28.820 - 11:35.160:  Mike Thompson. Ukraine says it successfully retaken control of four gas drilling platforms in
11:35.160 - 11:41.220:  the Black Sea close to Russian occupied Crimea. The platforms were apparently being used by Russia
11:41.220 - 11:47.160:  for military purposes with more details here's Paul Adams. The video and statement released by
11:47.160 - 11:52.340:  Ukraine's military intelligence offer a rare glimpse into a contest that's been going on away from
11:52.340 - 11:58.420:  the cameras since last year. Ukraine says the gas platforms established more than a decade ago and
11:58.420 - 12:03.780:  occupied by Russia in 2015 have been used as helicopter launch pads and radar stations,
12:03.780 - 12:09.400:  part of an ongoing battle for control of the Northern Black Sea. In the video which the BBC has
12:09.400 - 12:14.780:  not been able to verify, Ukrainian special forces can be seen removing military equipment and
12:14.780 - 12:20.240:  being fired upon from the air. There's no obvious evidence of any further combat, but a spokesman
12:20.240 - 12:24.360:  for military intelligence said Russian troops on one of the platforms had been killed.
12:25.320 - 12:30.960:  Paul Adams. The North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly set off for a much anticipated
12:30.960 - 12:37.020:  summit with a Russian president Vladimir Putin. South Korean media says the armored train Mr. Kim
12:37.020 - 12:43.480:  uses for foreign visits appears to be heading towards the Russian Far East. The two men are expected
12:43.480 - 12:48.920:  to discuss the possibility of Pyongyang supplying Moscow with weapons for the war in Ukraine.
12:49.680 - 12:55.680:  The summit could take place as soon as Tuesday, although the train does travel at a rather
12:55.680 - 13:02.920:  sedate 48 kilometers per hour. So why has Mr. Kim chosen this mode of transport for his first
13:02.920 - 13:09.920:  trip abroad in four years? Evan Davis heard more from Jean H. Lee who was the first Pyongyang
13:09.920 - 13:15.700:  bureau chief for the Associated Press News Agency. Aside from being able to control the security
13:16.100 - 13:22.700:  on the train, I think it's also important to remember that there's a huge propaganda element to
13:22.700 - 13:29.800:  this for Kim Jong Un. This is his big re-emergence after four years of self-imposed isolation.
13:29.820 - 13:37.660:  And the train is hugely symbolic in North Korea. I was just looking at some pictures of his father,
13:37.660 - 13:45.320:  his late father Kim Jong Il, who also took a train to Russia in 2011, and they put out a whole
13:45.320 - 13:50.840:  magazine devoted to this train trip to Russia. So there's a lot of propaganda around it that and
13:50.840 - 13:57.220:  so what Kim Jong Il wants to do is to evoke that Kim family legacy by making this big train trip to
13:57.220 - 14:01.960:  Russia. But his father was someone who was a bit scared of flying, I think, which would explain why he
14:01.960 - 14:07.280:  took the train. Yeah, absolutely. He was notoriously afraid of flying, and so he took the train
14:07.280 - 14:12.700:  everywhere inside the country and abroad. And so I think that was a way for the North Koreans to
14:12.700 - 14:18.860:  use his fear of flying and turn it into something that they said was proof of his devotion to the people.
14:18.860 - 14:23.580:  So it's pure propaganda. Now Kim Jong Un, his son, he's young guy, he's not afraid of flying.
14:23.580 - 14:29.380:  What he wants to do is establish his family's hold on power and also show his people, the North
14:29.380 - 14:34.320:  Koreans, that he's following in his father's footsteps, his grandfather's footsteps, and also
14:34.320 - 14:39.920:  that this traditional ally, Russia, has not forgotten about North Korea and still considers North
14:39.920 - 14:45.540:  Korean an important country. So there's a lot of, I think, a lot of propaganda wrapped up in this
14:45.540 - 14:52.060:  trip, travel by train, as well, of course, with the deliverables that were expecting or thinking
14:52.060 - 14:58.420:  they may get out of this summit. Now, have you seen the train? So I have seen the trains that Kim
14:58.420 - 15:03.580:  Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, his father and grandfather took, and I've written one of Kim Jong Il's special
15:03.580 - 15:10.600:  trains, and I can't say that I wrote this special train that I have, but I have written one of his
15:10.600 - 15:15.440:  special trains. So I know that it is very different than the usual train in North Korea.
15:15.760 - 15:20.540:  I'm not surprised here that we're talking orient Express like partial, what are we saying here?
15:20.540 - 15:25.720:  I mean, I would say, yeah, for North Korea, pretty posh, all the seats were covered with this
15:26.260 - 15:32.040:  kind of brocade, turquoise, brocade fabric, and you can see a picture from the inside of the train
15:32.040 - 15:36.240:  on my Twitter feed, on my Twitter profile, because it's the background image for my Twitter.
15:36.860 - 15:40.860:  My Twitter handle is news gene, but that was a picture that was taken. You'll see one of the women
15:40.860 - 15:46.080:  who was serving us, and you know, one of these women who's, who's brought on board to serve us.
15:46.120 - 15:50.860:  And so it was, it was interesting too. You go, you go through this countryside that's completely
15:50.860 - 15:57.400:  bereft and devastated, and you have soldiers lining that route all the way facing outward
15:58.040 - 16:04.300:  to protect the train from any attack. So it's certainly an unusual way to travel in some ways
16:04.300 - 16:10.000:  in North Koreans may think that they can control the security better by train. And that was American
16:10.000 - 16:17.420:  journalist Jean H. Lee. Scientists who led the team that created the world's first cloned mammal,
16:17.420 - 16:24.620:  Dolly the sheep, has died. Professor Ian Wilmot was 79. Dolly's arrival more than a quarter of
16:24.620 - 16:31.120:  a century ago here in the UK was hailed as a groundbreaking scientific development. Reflecting
16:31.120 - 16:38.140:  on her life in 2016, Professor Wilmot described how Dolly quickly gained global celebrity status.
16:38.800 - 16:43.600:  She became spoiled. The photographer soon discovered that she were even less obedient than
16:43.600 - 16:47.800:  people who were being photographed. And if he wants her to go to a particular place,
16:47.800 - 16:52.680:  she would have to offer her food. So her result of people doing this several times a day
16:52.680 - 16:57.080:  over the period of months, she actually became overweight. She caught the attention of politicians
16:57.080 - 17:02.700:  all the way around the world. Not always in the most positive way. Along with the giddy excitement,
17:02.700 - 17:08.700:  there also fears that humans would be next to be cloned, sparking visions of doomsday scenarios
17:08.700 - 17:14.800:  such as an army of super soldiers. Well shortly after Dolly's creation, the then US President
17:14.800 - 17:19.560:  Bill Clinton rapidly announced a ban on human cloning experiments.
17:20.280 - 17:25.920:  It has the potential to threaten the sacred family bonds at the very core of our ideals and our
17:25.920 - 17:32.620:  society. It is our moral obligation to confront these issues as they arise. Do act now to prevent
17:32.960 - 17:40.040:  abuse. So how big a scientific breakthrough was Dolly the sheep? Palab Gosh is the BBC science
17:40.040 - 17:48.840:  correspondent. It was a huge scientific development and it causes wave of euphoria but also incredible
17:48.840 - 17:55.740:  panic as you heard from Bill Clinton there about whether humans were next. It was something that was
17:55.740 - 18:01.660:  on the front pages and the leads of news bulletins, not just for that day, but for days
18:01.660 - 18:06.700:  and weeks as people wondered what was going to happen next. So explain to us exactly what his
18:06.740 - 18:12.620:  role was because he was part of a team. What the team did in order to create Dolly was that they
18:12.620 - 18:20.280:  took an adult cell and took the DNA out of it and put it into an empty sheep's egg. They
18:20.280 - 18:26.220:  zapped it with a little bit of electricity and that turned back the clock of the DNA inside and made
18:27.060 - 18:32.880:  into an embryo that was the exact genetic duplicate of the donor material and so that was
18:32.880 - 18:40.120:  re-implanted and Dolly was born to term. She was the first cloned mammal. What has the impact of her
18:40.120 - 18:45.840:  creation been now that the initial euphoria and the initial fears have died down? Well clearly
18:45.840 - 18:51.180:  there have been no cloned human beings thankfully there have been all sorts of regulations and
18:51.180 - 18:56.880:  prohibitions to try and stop that. Professor Wilmot and the team in Edinburgh who came up with
18:56.880 - 19:02.960:  the idea didn't want to clone humans. What they wanted to do was to grow tissue that could be used
19:02.960 - 19:09.480:  to treat diseases. So for example if someone had a brain disorder their tissue from any part of
19:09.480 - 19:14.840:  their body could be turned into embryonic material but rather than it grow into clone of the person
19:15.400 - 19:21.820:  it could be coaxed to become the tissue that the brain needed like nerve cells and re-implanted
19:21.820 - 19:28.400:  so that was the idea. But the initial hope of using the technology for medical breakthroughs
19:28.400 - 19:39.060:  hasn't yet appeared but progress is being made. Palabkosh. Still to come. Remember the force will
19:39.060 - 19:49.680:  be with you. Always. For Star Wars fans everywhere a rare model of an ex-wing fighter used in an
19:49.680 - 20:01.840:  action scene is up for auction next month. Unexpected element is all about finding the surprising
20:01.840 - 20:08.580:  science angles to everyday news. I love that this show has the scope to discuss both emergent AI
20:08.580 - 20:14.580:  new clearing Ghana and also what those stringy bits are on a banana and joining the dots between
20:14.580 - 20:20.120:  their global connections. Nature does pack a lot surprises for us. An invisibility cloak in the
20:20.120 - 20:25.880:  acoustic domain. So cool that's unexpected elements from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever
20:25.880 - 20:32.500:  you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The British Prime Minister
20:32.500 - 20:38.340:  Rishisunak has pledged to defend the UK's democracy in the face of what the government has called
20:38.340 - 20:44.940:  a systemic challenge from China as ministers come under more pressure to officially designate
20:44.940 - 20:51.700:  Beijing a threat. Some members of the governing Conservative Party have demanded a full review of
20:51.700 - 20:57.460:  Chinese influence in Britain after it was revealed that a parliamentary researcher had been arrested
20:57.460 - 21:03.580:  in March on suspicion of spying for Beijing. The opposition Labour Party has called in the government
21:03.580 - 21:09.140:  to explain whether the foreign secretary James Clevley was aware of the arrest before his recent
21:09.140 - 21:15.100:  trip to Beijing. The researcher says he's innocent and has branded the accusations against him
21:15.100 - 21:22.360:  as misreporting. In Parliament Mr Sunaik told MPs what he said to his Chinese counterpart when
21:22.360 - 21:29.080:  he met him at the recent G20 summit and why. The whole house is rightly appalled about reports of
21:29.080 - 21:35.400:  espionage in this building. The sanctity of this place must be protected and the right of members
21:35.400 - 21:41.500:  to speak their minds without fear or sanction must be maintained. We will defend our democracy
21:41.660 - 21:49.580:  and our security. So I was emphatic with Premier Lee that actions which seek to undermine British
21:49.580 - 21:57.200:  democracy are completely unacceptable and will never be tolerated. China has described the allegations
21:57.200 - 22:03.180:  that its intelligence services ran aspiring inside the British Parliament as malicious slander.
22:03.800 - 22:10.240:  Our security correspondent Gordon Carrera looks at how espionage has changed in the 21st century.
22:10.880 - 22:16.360:  Spying used to be fairly straightforward. An agent would steal a document stamped top secret
22:16.360 - 22:21.860:  and pass it on at a clandestine meeting. That was the world in which the UK's 1911 official
22:21.860 - 22:28.640:  secrets act was passed but much has changed since then. Now there's cyber espionage stealing online
22:28.640 - 22:34.260:  and the information might be held by companies or universities. There's also greater concern about
22:34.260 - 22:41.000:  interference operations in which spy services try to shape policy and debate. In this new world
22:41.000 - 22:46.420:  China poses a particular challenge. A report from the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security
22:46.420 - 22:52.980:  Committee this summer suggested the UK had been slow to wake up to it. The government stresses
22:52.980 - 22:58.360:  it is taking action including a new National Security Act to update the Official Secrets Act.
22:58.840 - 23:03.360:  For the first time it will be illegal to be an undercover foreign intelligence officer.
23:04.140 - 23:08.140:  But that power will not come into force until the end of the year officials say.
23:08.780 - 23:13.620:  And a new foreign influence registration scheme will not come into force until next year at the
23:13.620 - 23:18.640:  earliest. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was possible China would be placed on the enhanced
23:18.640 - 23:25.400:  tier for that register requiring extra checks. That means it may take some time for there to be
23:25.400 - 23:30.700:  a clear review of what China is up to and how far the authorities will go in confronting it.
23:31.540 - 23:33.560:  Our Security Correspondent Gordon Carrera.
23:34.460 - 23:39.040:  Rui Pinto is a man that shook the world of football but not in a way this sport would have
23:39.040 - 23:43.960:  wished for. The Portuguese computer hacker is behind the biggest league of information in the
23:43.960 - 23:50.240:  sports history publishing millions of confidential documents online. The leaked files included
23:50.240 - 23:55.940:  alleged cases of tax evasion and potentially dubious deals involving some top football clubs
23:55.940 - 24:01.940:  and star players. Their release has sparked criminal investigations in a number of European countries.
24:02.880 - 24:08.400:  Now after a three-year trial, Rui Pinto has been given a four-year suspended prison sentence
24:08.400 - 24:16.000:  for attempted extortion and illegal access to data. Pinto's lawyer Francisco Teixeira Demota
24:16.300 - 24:17.960:  spoke to reporters after the verdict.
24:21.060 - 24:27.140:  Rui Pinto did not expect to be acquitted because he himself had recognized illegality and he
24:27.140 - 24:33.060:  had shown his regret. What he expected was that the public service he provided would also be
24:33.100 - 24:38.580:  taken into account and I believe that this decision recognizes the existence of these public
24:39.220 - 24:44.080:  service. Our reporter Nigel Adley told us more about the man behind the leaks.
24:44.860 - 24:50.960:  Rui Pinto is a remarkable character in many ways. Only 34 years of age, he calls himself a
24:51.160 - 24:58.680:  self-taught computer expert and he managed to hack into various sources and he revealed a treasure
24:58.680 - 25:05.560:  trove in many ways of over 18 million documents and they were given to a number of very prominent
25:05.560 - 25:11.340:  publications across Europe and as a result of these leaks, a number of football clubs and
25:11.700 - 25:16.540:  world-famous football stars were hugely inconvenienced to say the very least.
25:16.840 - 25:21.760:  Among the people, a number of clients from the world-famous football agent George Mendes
25:21.760 - 25:27.720:  were investigative attacks evasion and Cristiano Ronaldo was forced to pay a fine of $20 million
25:27.740 - 25:34.440:  to the Spanish tax authorities in the end. There were allegations that football clubs such as Manchester
25:34.440 - 25:41.180:  City had infringed UEFA's financial fair play rules. A lot of the information leaked by Pinto
25:41.180 - 25:47.140:  was used in an investigation from UEFA which ultimately banned Manchester City from the Champions
25:47.140 - 25:52.780:  League for two years and so that was overturned on appeal. But whose defence is that he was acting
25:52.780 - 25:58.700:  as a whistleblower? Yes and it will certainly I think make many future whistleblowers in all walks
25:58.700 - 26:04.400:  of life think very hard before they choose to reveal their information because he has always said
26:04.400 - 26:09.840:  that he did this in the interests of football and when he was asked before his sentencing whether
26:09.840 - 26:14.820:  he believed it was all worth it. He basically shrugged his shoulders and said we'll have to wait
26:14.820 - 26:20.360:  and see but he's not just focused on football. He was also behind the famous Luander leaks.
26:20.360 - 26:26.800:  That was around 700,000 emails and other documents which really explained how the daughter
26:26.800 - 26:32.920:  of the late Angolan dictator Jose Doss Santos built up her business empire and became the wealthiest
26:32.920 - 26:38.880:  woman in Africa. So he's clearly somebody who was very good at being a whistleblower but the way
26:38.880 - 26:45.960:  he carried out his hacking was viewed by many people as extortion. Nigel Adley, a UN report says
26:45.960 - 26:52.020:  cocaine production in Colombia, the world's biggest producer of the drug has reached a new record.
26:52.020 - 26:59.500:  It rose by nearly a quarter last year to more than 1700 tons. Here's our America's regional
26:59.500 - 27:05.280:  editor Leonardo Russia. In its annual report the UN office on drugs and crime says cocaine
27:05.280 - 27:12.360:  output in Colombia is higher than any time since monitoring began more than 20 years ago. Half of
27:12.360 - 27:17.720:  the coca leaf crop which is the raw material for the drug is grown inside indigenous reserves
27:17.720 - 27:23.880:  or national parks. Colombia's left-wing president Gustavo Petro has been critical of the war on
27:23.880 - 27:28.960:  drugs policies sponsored by the United States in previous decades. He said they led to an
27:28.960 - 27:35.240:  increasing violence and victimized vulnerable people in rural areas. But a year after taking office
27:35.240 - 27:40.340:  he's yet to come up with an effective plan to address the problem. Leonardo Russia.
27:41.120 - 27:46.640:  On Monday, Chileans marked the 50th anniversary of the military coup led by General Augusto
27:46.640 - 27:51.720:  Pinochet against the democratically elected government of President Salvador Ayende.
27:58.220 - 28:05.340:  On September 11, 1973, fighter jets roared over the capital Santiago, firing their rockets
28:05.340 - 28:10.880:  at the presidential palace, tanks patrolled the surrounding streets while soldiers rounded
28:10.940 - 28:17.600:  up hundreds of civilian prisoners. Inside the palace, President Ayende made his final appeal to the
28:17.600 - 28:29.000:  Chilean people. History is ours. It is made by the people. Workers of my homeland,
28:29.880 - 28:36.400:  I have faith in Chile and her destiny. Other men will overcome this gray and bitter moment
28:37.180 - 28:43.580:  in which treason seeks to impose itself. Continue in the knowledge that, much sooner than later,
28:44.560 - 28:50.700:  the great avenues that lead to the construction of a better society will once again be open.
28:53.460 - 28:58.980:  That was at nine in the morning. Five hours later, he was dead, having taken his own life.
28:59.780 - 29:04.680:  General Pinochet had seized power and would hold onto it for the next 17 years.
29:05.900 - 29:10.000:  James Menendez spoke to someone who remembers that fateful day all too clearly.
29:10.820 - 29:16.180:  Sergio Bitter was Ayende's mining minister. After imprisonment by the hunter and exiled
29:16.180 - 29:21.880:  in the US, he went on to serve again, most recently as minister for public works under President
29:21.880 - 29:29.040:  Michel Bachelet. What is he remember of that day, 50 years ago? Well, the strongest thing I remember
29:30.040 - 29:37.020:  is first the bombardment of the government palace on the one side. The second is that I was
29:37.420 - 29:45.480:  having lunch with President Ayende the day before. So less than 24 hours before he died.
29:46.240 - 29:52.500:  So we had agreed on some things. We were four or five ministers that we were discussing with him
29:53.520 - 30:01.480:  for his speech next day, the day of the coup. So I was in the hot place, all those hours.
30:01.580 - 30:10.140:  And then the day following the coup, I was called by a military announcement asking me to
30:10.140 - 30:16.400:  present myself to them. When you were with Salvador Ayende the day before the coup,
30:16.420 - 30:22.140:  what was he and indeed you? Were you expecting it to happen? Did you have any idea that that was
30:22.140 - 30:28.120:  what was going on? That was a discussion and rumors that were taking place for months.
30:29.180 - 30:34.980:  So that discussion was the last analysis we were doing with the minister of defense
30:35.020 - 30:41.380:  on his conversations with the very general and admiral at the time to explore if that was
30:41.380 - 30:49.420:  imminent or we could avoid this thing and solve it through a political decision.
30:50.340 - 30:54.260:  And he felt he had no choice but to take his own life, did he?
30:54.620 - 31:00.700:  Well, I would say those things when they become so polarized and I were not able to solve it
31:01.360 - 31:06.380:  before to reduce tensions. Your range for maneuvering is very narrow.
31:07.120 - 31:13.680:  Situation was extremely violent and the decision from from the very beginning with the Nixon
31:13.680 - 31:21.580:  administration and his group was to avoid again the taking the presidency and later to overthrow him.
31:21.920 - 31:27.040:  The Nixon administration thought that Chile was going to become or was becoming another
31:27.760 - 31:32.040:  Cuba, didn't they? I mean, what was Salvador Ayende trying to do? What was he a communist?
31:32.040 - 31:39.700:  He was not a communist. If you have to define him in his character, he is a democratic socialist,
31:40.440 - 31:46.540:  he was a democrat all his time. He was deputy member of the House,
31:47.340 - 31:56.080:  three-time senator, president of the Senate, minister in the 40s of health. So all his trajectories,
31:56.080 - 32:04.040:  the trajectory of the democrat. So the main element that has to be discussed historically and
32:04.040 - 32:14.660:  had so much impact in Europe is if it was possible to look for a road for big transformations
32:14.660 - 32:21.460:  in a democracy in a poor country. So the discussion was not if he was or not a democrat,
32:21.460 - 32:28.100:  but if the democratic institutions in a poor country with very strong
32:28.840 - 32:35.900:  opposition from different forces as I described made them that viable or not, that was the
32:36.440 - 32:40.540:  discussion. Sergio Bitter, a minister in the ousted government of Salvador Ayende.
32:41.440 - 32:46.260:  Now the Star Wars films, particularly the first three, have spawned a whole memorabilia industry.
32:46.720 - 32:52.120:  Devoted fans collect anything associated with the movies made by Lucasfilm. So there's great
32:52.120 - 32:57.400:  excitement about a rare model of an ex-wing fighter that's being put up for auction next month.
32:58.000 - 33:05.000:  Bids for the model used in a climatic battle scene started at $400,000. Phoebe Hobson reports.
33:08.940 - 33:13.660:  For decades, nobody knew the location of a long-lost model that played a pivotal role in the
33:13.660 - 33:19.060:  original Star Wars film from 1977. The ex-wing fighter was used in the final battle,
33:19.560 - 33:22.600:  including the famous trench run of Star Wars and you hope.
33:27.000 - 33:30.640:  It was built by George Lucas' visual effects company, Industrial Light and Magic,
33:31.220 - 33:35.560:  but was discovered in a box that belonged to the late Oscar-nominated model maker, Greg Jean.
33:36.520 - 33:40.380:  Friends of Mr. Jean have been sifting through his collection that also included an original
33:40.380 - 33:45.300:  stormtrooper costume from a new hope and an astronaut suit from Stanley Kubrick's 2001,
33:45.300 - 33:50.060:  a space odyssey. It's intricate detail makes it just one of four models known as hero models.
33:50.860 - 33:55.160:  The 50-centimeter model has articulating wings, working light, and battle marks.
33:55.760 - 33:59.700:  It means it could be used for close-up shots at a time when special effects technology
33:59.700 - 34:02.420:  was struggling to keep up with the demands of film directors.
34:13.780 - 34:18.920:  Now the ex-wing fighter's next mission is an auction next month in Dallas. Bidding starts
34:18.920 - 34:25.040:  at $400,000 and prices could so high as some consider it the pinnacle of Star Wars artefacts
34:25.340 - 34:26.580:  to ever reach the market.
34:32.160 - 34:33.360:  Phoebe Hobson reporting.
