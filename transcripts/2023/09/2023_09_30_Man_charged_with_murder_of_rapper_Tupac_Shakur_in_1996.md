*00:34.020- 00:38.580* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Saturday the 30th of September, these are our main stories.
*00:39.140- 00:44.140* :  A man in the US state of Nevada has been charged with a murder of the rapper Tupac Shakur who was
*00:44.140- 00:49.880* :  killed in a drive-by shooting 27 years ago. A state of emergency has been declared in New York City
*00:49.880- 00:55.120* :  where flash floods have caused major disruption. Washington says there has been a build-up of
*00:55.120- 01:03.660* :  Serbian forces on the border with Kosovo. Also in this podcast, it's nearly every metal detector
*01:03.660- 01:09.380* :  is dreamed to find some hidden treasure, maybe some gold or something that was held by a Saxon or
*01:09.380- 01:14.800* :  Roman. So what did a Norwegian family come across while searching for a missing hearing?
*01:18.240- 01:23.700* :  We begin in the US. It's a case that has frustrated investigators and fascinated the public.
*01:24.280- 01:29.260* :  Tupac Shakur, one of the most acclaimed rappers in hip-hop, was gunned down on the Las Vegas
*01:29.260- 01:35.320* :  strip 27 years ago. The identity of his killer has remained a mystery. It's been the epitome of
*01:35.320- 01:41.600* :  a cold case, a long unsolved but still open criminal investigation. Until now, Baps, because
*01:41.600- 01:46.680* :  police have arrested a man over the drive-by murder of Tupac Shakur. Steve Wolfson is the
*01:46.680- 01:52.500* :  Las Vegas Clark County District Attorney. It has often been said justice delayed is justice
*01:52.500- 01:58.980* :  denied. It's a quote we hear often and for many many years when talking about our legal system,
*01:58.980- 02:05.900* :  but not in this case. Today justice will be served in the murder of Tupac Shakur.
*02:06.400- 02:10.140* :  Our North America reporter Reagan Morris is in Los Angeles and Toby the latest.
*02:10.140- 02:17.340* :  They've arrested Dwayne Keithy-D Davis. He is an associate who knew Tupac and he's a man that
*02:17.340- 02:24.040* :  lives in the Las Vegas area. They raided his wife's home about two months ago. So that we sort of
*02:24.040- 02:27.560* :  knew something was happening with the investigation and that caught many by surprise.
*02:28.440- 02:34.780* :  And in that raid, they took some cell phones, computer hard drives, a computer, and a copy of
*02:34.780- 02:41.960* :  Keithy-D's memoir. He had a 2019 memoir where he admitted to being in the Cadillac that the shots
*02:41.960- 02:48.280* :  that were fired that ultimately did kill Tupac. And Reagan, reminders of the circumstances of
*02:48.280- 02:54.960* :  Tupac Shakur's death? Yeah, it was 27 years ago and they were, he was driving in a convoy of cars
*02:54.960- 03:01.380* :  on the sunset strip and they were to red light and a Cadillac pulled up and someone in that Cadillac
*03:01.380- 03:06.320* :  opened fire and those were the shots that ultimately killed Tupac. He lived a few days later
*03:06.320- 03:12.280* :  in hospital. But he, no one ever knew there was so much mystery who did shoot him.
*03:12.980- 03:17.660* :  And Keithy-D has written in his memoir and has talked about that he was in that Cadillac.
*03:17.660- 03:19.920* :  So it's been known. He's been known to investigators.
*03:20.300- 03:24.840* :  And I suppose there's a lot of surprise for some people that it's taken so long to get anywhere
*03:24.840- 03:29.520* :  with this case. What are the theories behind why that might be?
*03:29.820- 03:34.980* :  Oh, there's so many conspiracy theories about East Coast, West Coast grudges between rappers.
*03:34.980- 03:41.440* :  I was listening to an interview, an earlier interview with Tupac's brother after they had the
*03:42.380- 03:47.280* :  the police raid in Las Vegas a couple months ago of Keithy-D's house and you know he wasn't
*03:47.280- 03:52.320* :  surprised at all. He's more surprised that they never took the investigation as seriously as he
*03:52.320- 03:57.380* :  would have liked and found more evidence and he thinks there's people out there that know what
*03:57.380- 04:01.860* :  happened but isn't necessarily surprised that they didn't. I think there's a lot of distrust
*04:01.860- 04:06.700* :  in that family and within many in the black community over police and who knows what happened
*04:06.700- 04:11.520* :  with that investigation but it seems like something is happening now and maybe we will find out
*04:11.520- 04:17.200* :  finally who killed Tupac. Reagan Morris in LA. Staying in the US, as we record this podcast,
*04:17.200- 04:22.440* :  a flashed flood emergency is enforced in New York as multiple waves of heavy rain hit the city.
*04:22.800- 04:25.620* :  The downpours began during Friday morning's rush hour.
*04:30.560- 04:35.420* :  Emergency services responded to the dangerous conditions and people were rescued from basements.
*04:35.420- 04:39.240* :  The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, made this appeal.
*04:39.520- 04:44.380* :  I want to say to all New Yorkers, this is time for heightened alertness and extreme
*04:44.460- 04:52.140* :  caution. If you are home, stay home. If you are at work or school, shelter in place for now.
*04:52.300- 04:57.940* :  Some of our subways are flooded and it's extremely difficult to move around the city.
*04:58.320- 05:05.760* :  Well these New Yorkers were in despair. I'm lost. I'm lost. I feel terrible. I don't even know where I'm
*05:06.200- 05:12.340* :  going because I'm accustomed to catching particular train. Now I come to train is delayed. It'll
*05:12.340- 05:18.660* :  win. It's disgusted. I don't know what New York needs to do to mitigate this problem. I
*05:18.660- 05:24.240* :  understand it happens a couple of times a year. So it seems like there should be plenty of
*05:24.520- 05:31.680* :  information to know how to mitigate the flooding when these disastrous intense rains happen.
*05:32.540- 05:37.260* :  I correspond to Nedda Tothique in New York and she told me there's been chaos across the city.
*05:37.500- 05:43.340* :  This made commuting this morning nearly impossible for New Yorkers. As passengers went out on the
*05:43.340- 05:48.780* :  roadways, they found that they had been just essentially covered, turned into rivers and just
*05:49.140- 05:53.400* :  bumper to bumper traffic. Some people even found themselves stranded and needing help.
*05:53.800- 05:59.500* :  On the subways, I mean every single line was impacted. So the delays were just intense,
*05:59.580- 06:06.400* :  17 lines in Brooklyn were suspended altogether and people were just taking videos. You can see
*06:06.400- 06:11.440* :  all over social media, the water rushing into the station, the tracks covering the roadways,
*06:11.440- 06:17.200* :  and then on top of that, people who were trying to leave the area with the airports found that in
*06:17.200- 06:22.400* :  LaGuardia, for example, one of the terminals was completely shut. All air traffic was delayed.
*06:22.400- 06:28.500* :  So it really has been a chaotic morning and for some people a scary and dangerous morning as they
*06:28.500- 06:32.680* :  set off on their commutes. And Nedda, everybody saw the satellite pictures ahead of this. They're
*06:32.720- 06:37.480* :  pretty much new. It was likely to happen, but there's not much you can do in the short term to
*06:37.480- 06:44.480* :  prevent it, much like the last big flood after the hurricane Sandy back in 2012. Yeah, that's right.
*06:44.480- 06:49.480* :  And I mean, even if we look back to the recent hurricane, Hurricane Ida, the issue in New York is
*06:49.480- 06:55.840* :  when you've had several days of rainfall already, the area is saturated, the infrastructure is
*06:55.840- 07:01.680* :  saturated. And so when you have rainfall, that's intense in such a short amount of time. This
*07:01.680- 07:06.620* :  New York City's sewer system just can't cope to be frank. I mean, we heard that from officials
*07:06.620- 07:11.780* :  in the briefing today. And so when I've been kind of going around here in Goanis and Brooklyn,
*07:11.780- 07:17.260* :  one of the areas that has been the most affected, you see basements just absolutely flooded, you see
*07:17.260- 07:21.960* :  cars that were covered up to the doorways in water. And even though it's begun to recede now,
*07:22.380- 07:27.040* :  these are areas that people keep expensive business equipment. So one of the businesses,
*07:27.040- 07:32.420* :  they lost freezers, a heater, merchandise, and it's going to cost tens of thousands of dollars,
*07:32.820- 07:37.900* :  yet this is an area where you can't get something like flood insurance. So New York is increasingly
*07:37.900- 07:45.020* :  seeing these rain events become pretty expensive and damaging to the economy and the livelihood
*07:45.020- 07:49.440* :  of people. And New York can expect worse in the years to come. What's actually changed since
*07:49.440- 07:55.520* :  the hurricane Sandy 11 years ago? I mean, it always is an issue of money. You know, I always point
*07:55.520- 08:01.100* :  to the Gateway Project, which was supposed to build another tunnel between New York and New Jersey,
*08:01.100- 08:06.280* :  because the one that's operating now was damaged significantly by Hurricane Sandy. And yet,
*08:06.580- 08:12.220* :  the entire tricade area is relying on that tunnel. It's been over a decade and that project is
*08:12.220- 08:17.480* :  still just getting started. Certainly when you look at new buildings in New York, there's been a lot
*08:17.480- 08:23.500* :  of research into how to make buildings more resilient to sea level rises and climate change.
*08:23.500- 08:29.920* :  And those things are taking place, but the simple issues that we see again and again, too many
*08:29.920- 08:35.100* :  basement apartments in New York City, when there's already a housing crunch, the sewer system
*08:35.100- 08:40.200* :  unable to cope. These are issues that aren't being fully resolved yet, and it is happening again
*08:40.200- 08:45.140* :  and again when the rain overwhelms the system. Netatorfic in New York.
*08:45.880- 08:52.020* :  Diane Feinstein, the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history, has died at the age of 90.
*08:52.180- 08:57.840* :  A passionate advocate for gun control, Ms Feinstein was sworn in as San Francisco's mayor in 1978.
*08:57.840- 09:02.800* :  Shortly after her predecessor, Harvey Milk, and then the country's only openly gay politician,
*09:02.800- 09:08.080* :  was gunned down inside City Hall. Later, as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
*09:08.080- 09:14.100* :  she released a report detailing the CIA's secret overseas detentions of terror suspects.
*09:14.220- 09:20.020* :  President Biden led tributes to his fellow Democrat, describing her as a pioneering American.
*09:20.580- 09:27.820* :  She was a historic figure. Trial blazer for women and a great friend. Diane made her mark
*09:27.820- 09:33.100* :  in everything from national security to the environment, to gun safety, to protecting civil liberties.
*09:34.380- 09:37.720* :  The country's going to miss her dearly, and so will Jill and I.
*09:38.220- 09:43.060* :  Well, the Senate's majority leader, Chuck Schumer, spoke in front of her desk just after her death
*09:43.060- 09:52.420* :  was announced on Friday. Today, we grieve. We look at that desk, and we know what we have lost,
*09:54.160- 10:00.180* :  but we also give thanks. Thanks to someone so rareified, so grave, so graceful of presence
*10:00.980- 10:04.220* :  served in this chamber. I heard more from our North America correspondent,
*10:04.220- 10:07.780* :  Barbara Platt Asher, on Senator Diane Feinstein's prolific career.
*10:08.220- 10:12.840* :  She got started in California politics in the 1960s, and then ultimately spent 30 years in
*10:12.840- 10:17.060* :  the Senate, and as you were mentioning, she was a vocal advocate for gay marriage, for environmental
*10:17.060- 10:21.340* :  protection, and for greater gun controls. She was passionate about these priorities and others,
*10:21.720- 10:25.380* :  but she was also pragmatic about getting stuff done across the aisle, which made her quite
*10:25.380- 10:29.660* :  an effective legislator. And here, she was addressing the Senate Judicial Committee ahead of a
*10:29.660- 10:35.760* :  vote on gun control in March 2013. We've seen it in universities. We've seen them in elementary
*10:35.760- 10:42.040* :  schools, and now we have seen them used against first graders. The time has come, America,
*10:42.040- 10:48.700* :  to step up and ban these weapons. She also helped document the CIA's torture of foreign
*10:48.700- 10:53.460* :  terrorism suspects when she was chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. She led a five-year
*10:53.460- 10:59.860* :  investigation, and in 2014, she spoke out following publication of the report, which was into post
*10:59.860- 11:07.360* :  9-11 interrogation tactics. The report exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values
*11:07.360- 11:14.980* :  as a nation. It chronicles a stain on our history that must never be allowed to happen again.
*11:15.180- 11:21.960* :  This is not what Americans do. It's a very strong on policy. She was also very much a trailblazer
*11:21.960- 11:26.580* :  for women in American politics, wasn't she? She certainly was, and that is something that many
*11:26.580- 11:30.300* :  people have been saying in their tributes. Even the Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy
*11:30.300- 11:35.440* :  said that she inspired women from both sides of the aisle. She was the first female mayor of San
*11:35.440- 11:39.820* :  Francisco. She was the first female candidate of a major party for governor of California.
*11:39.820- 11:45.140* :  She was one of California's two first female senators. She was the first woman to head the Senate
*11:45.140- 11:48.580* :  Intelligence Committee. She was the first woman to serve as the Judiciary Committee's top
*11:48.580- 11:54.020* :  Democrat. So lots of firsts in her career. She broke gender barriers. And we heard from Chuck
*11:54.020- 11:58.820* :  Schumer earlier on a very moving tribute. What have other people been saying? Nancy Pelosi,
*11:58.820- 12:04.220* :  the former Democratic House Speaker, talked about her as a pioneering woman leader in the fierce
*12:04.220- 12:09.340* :  champion of gender justice. And as I mentioned, you had a couple of Republicans also giving her
*12:09.460- 12:14.420* :  tributes. Marco Rubio, the Republican Senator, called her hardworking, always treating everyone
*12:14.420- 12:18.820* :  with courtesy and respect. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, also called her his
*12:18.820- 12:25.100* :  friend, said she was a trail baser with dogged advocacy and a diligent service. And you saw
*12:25.100- 12:30.340* :  that the Senate has taken physical steps, putting the flag at half-mask and also put it draping
*12:30.340- 12:35.360* :  her chair in black velvet with a vase of white roses. I'm briefly Barbara. What will happen now?
*12:35.360- 12:40.300* :  How will she be replaced? The governor of California will probably appoint somebody to take her
*12:40.300- 12:44.580* :  place until an election for her replacement can be held. You'll want to do that as quickly as
*12:44.580- 12:48.700* :  possible because the Senate is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans so they want to
*12:48.700- 12:53.020* :  keep that Democratic vote, but you will almost certainly be replaced by a Democrat because California
*12:53.020- 12:59.520* :  is strongly Democratic. That was Barbara Pletasha. The United States says it's monitoring a
*12:59.520- 13:04.240* :  Serbian military buildup along the border of Kosovo, as tensions rise between ethnic,
*13:04.240- 13:10.020* :  Serb and Albanian communities. The White House said there was an unprecedented deployment of tanks.
*13:10.140- 13:16.040* :  Our Balkans correspondent Guida Lorney has more details. The United States is urging Serbia to
*13:16.040- 13:21.180* :  withdraw a large military deployment near its border with Kosovo. White House National Security
*13:21.180- 13:27.460* :  Council spokesperson John Kirby described the unprecedented staging of advanced Serbian artillery
*13:27.460- 13:33.480* :  as a very destabilizing development. Tensions are high after the deaths of a Kosovo police officer
*13:33.480- 13:39.340* :  and three members of an armed group in majority served North Kosovo last Sunday. Britain has
*13:39.340- 13:45.220* :  confirmed it's sending a battalion to join NATO's K-4 peacekeepers. It said it was a response to
*13:45.220- 13:52.340* :  the current situation in Kosovo. Guida Lorney. Next to Slovakia and Slobecs go to the polls today
*13:52.340- 13:56.980* :  in early elections following the collapse of the center-right coalition earlier this year.
*13:57.720- 14:03.920* :  Leading the polls is the left-wing populist smear party of Robert Fizzo, who was forced to step
*14:03.920- 14:09.960* :  down as Prime Minister, following the murder of the investigative journalist Jan Kuchiak in 2018.
*14:09.960- 14:15.820* :  As Rob Cameron reports from Bratislava, Mr Fizzo has grabbed the headlines with a pledge to end
*14:15.820- 14:25.500* :  Slovak military support for Ukraine immediately. The closing weeks of a bad tempered election
*14:25.500- 14:32.520* :  campaign in Slovakia, coming to a head as an outdoor press briefing by Robert Fizzo's smear party.
*14:32.520- 14:40.700* :  The event was gait crashed by Igor Matovich, another former Prime Minister who ended up being
*14:40.700- 14:49.140* :  pumped in the head. For the incident was a little more than a side show. Igor Matovich's star has
*14:49.140- 14:55.080* :  fallen. Robert Fizzo, however, could be on the verge of a comeback, one that could have far
*14:55.080- 15:00.540* :  reaching consequences. We need to stop sending the weapons and the military equipment to Ukraine,
*15:00.540- 15:05.980* :  and then we need to stop this war. Whatever price, smear didn't respond to requests for an
*15:05.980- 15:11.700* :  interview. But this is the party's MP, Lubos Blaha, speaking to the BBC this summer.
*15:11.960- 15:16.580* :  I can understand that Ukrainians wouldn't be happy that they will lose, for example,
*15:16.580- 15:22.160* :  Donbas or Crimea. But still, we need to be realistic and we see that this war is not only the
*15:22.800- 15:27.560* :  conflict between Ukraine and Russia. We see it as a proxy war of the United States against Russia
*15:27.560- 15:30.620* :  in Ukrainian land. And this is something very different.
*15:31.120- 15:36.820* :  Robert Fizzo's threat that he will not send one more round of ammunition to Kiev has sent
*15:36.820- 15:42.700* :  alarm bells ringing. This is a country that has so far been a loyal and steadfast ally,
*15:42.700- 15:49.800* :  sending its entire fleet of MIG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. But some say that threat is a red
*15:49.800- 15:55.480* :  herring. Slovakia has already donated so much there's almost nothing left to give.
*15:55.500- 16:02.140* :  The cupboard's bear, as one unnamed Western official told me, the thundering populist rhetoric,
*16:02.140- 16:07.260* :  is just that, they say, rhetoric. Others aren't so sure.
*16:07.620- 16:12.640* :  Several foreign diplomats ask me, aren't you crying off too early?
*16:12.920- 16:18.780* :  Biata Balogovar, editor-in-chief of the Slovak Daily's smear, she says it's dangerous to assume
*16:18.780- 16:24.240* :  that once in office Fizzo the populist will give way to Fizzo the pragmatist.
*16:24.480- 16:29.920* :  It's a very wrong assumption, because right now Robert Fizzo doesn't have a better version.
*16:30.520- 16:33.780* :  He has to keep feeding his electorate.
*16:37.460- 16:43.180* :  Across the border in the Czech city of Bruno, smear's main challenger, progressive Slovakia,
*16:43.460- 16:48.460* :  was drumming up support amongst Slovak university students. Their vision of an open
*16:48.460- 16:55.500* :  tolerant cosmopolitan Slovakia is dismissed as liberal fascism by smear, who offers stability,
*16:55.500- 17:02.820* :  order and social security instead. Progressive Slovakia's deputy leader Tomasz Valaszek says Robert
*17:02.820- 17:07.760* :  Fizzo has been inspired by another illiberal politician in Hungary.
*17:08.320- 17:14.680* :  My concern is, the Viktor Orbán has said an example that you can pursue illiberal policies,
*17:15.620- 17:19.700* :  cement your hold on power by rigging the electoral system and still get away with it
*17:20.040- 17:24.460* :  without being really in trouble with the EU and NATO, and therefore we've made it far too easy
*17:24.460- 17:26.500* :  for Robert Fizzo to pursue Viktor Orbán's example.
*17:26.500- 17:32.420* :  With a third of voters undecided, and as many as ten parties potentially entering parliament,
*17:33.220- 17:36.020* :  in Slovakia, nothing is for certain.
*17:40.300- 17:41.940* :  Rob Cameron in Bratislava.
*17:42.340- 17:46.360* :  Now to Norway, where a family searching for some lost jury in their garden,
*17:46.360- 17:50.860* :  have stumbled upon a much older find instead, Rebecca Wood reports.
*17:51.480- 17:56.480* :  It's nearly every metal detector stream to find some hidden treasure, maybe some gold
*17:56.480- 18:02.100* :  or something that was held by a Saxon or Roman, but one family from Norway have fulfilled that
*18:02.100- 18:08.600* :  goal without even trying. The Asvik family, from the small island of Jomfruland, got out their
*18:08.600- 18:14.500* :  metal detector to hunt for a lost gold earring in their backyard. The telltale beep of a potential
*18:14.500- 18:20.280* :  find went off near a big tree in the centre, but instead of unerthing their piece of missing
*18:20.280- 18:27.780* :  jewelry, they found two small metal artifacts instead, one round, one oval and both with intricate
*18:27.780- 18:34.420* :  cross detailing. Archaeologists have taken a look and identified the pieces as a Viking era
*18:34.420- 18:40.020* :  class and buckle, objects from the grave of a woman buried over one thousand years ago.
*18:41.020- 18:45.320* :  Although long believed to be the case, it's the first evidence that the area was inhabited
*18:45.320- 18:51.160* :  during Viking times. But what of their missing gold earring? Well, that's still not been found.
*18:51.160- 18:56.780* :  But give it another thousand years and you might hear another similar sounding news report on the
*18:56.780- 19:02.140* :  airwaves. Rebecca Wood. Still to come.
*19:08.360- 19:13.940* :  So, will we really hear the actor Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp singing in his own
*19:13.940- 19:17.560* :  voice in a new remix version of the Sound of Music film?
*19:24.600- 19:27.900* :  The attacker had very good knowledge of banking systems.
*19:28.200- 19:32.780* :  $2.1 billion in stolen funds. Money laundering operations. A cyber criminal group.
*19:32.780- 19:38.100* :  These are smart guys. Season one and two of the Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service are
*19:38.100- 19:44.080* :  available in full right now. Following the twists and turns in the incredible story of the Lazarus
*19:44.080- 19:48.720* :  group hackers. The Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service. Catch up with the whole series now
*19:48.720- 19:57.100* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News podcast. The Afghan Embassy
*19:57.100- 20:02.240* :  in India has suspended all operations and the ambassador and other senior diplomats have left
*20:02.240- 20:07.180* :  the country. Officials say Delhi will now take over the diplomatic compound in a caretaker
*20:07.180- 20:12.700* :  capacity. Lipika Palem has more details. The Afghan ambassador Farid Mamunzeh, who was
*20:12.700- 20:18.080* :  appointed by Afghanistan's previous Western-backed government, has been battling to stay in office
*20:18.080- 20:24.340* :  in defiance of the Taliban in Kabul. Embassy officials in Delhi say Mr Mamunzeh and at least five
*20:24.340- 20:29.340* :  other diplomats have now gone to Europe and the United States where they have received political
*20:29.340- 20:35.420* :  asylum. India doesn't recognise the Taliban and closed its own embassy in Kabul after the
*20:35.420- 20:42.160* :  Islamist group took power in 2021. The Taliban have taken control of 14 of Afghanistan's overseas
*20:42.160- 20:48.380* :  missions but Delhi isn't one of them. Lipika Palem. The International Paralympic Committee has
*20:48.380- 20:54.100* :  voted to allow Russian athletes to take part in next year's Paris Games despite the invasion
*20:54.140- 20:59.740* :  of Ukraine. Member nations meeting in Bahrain voted against a full suspension of Russian
*20:59.740- 21:05.160* :  competitors but decided that they will have to compete as neutral participants. Athletes from
*21:05.160- 21:10.900* :  Russia will not be permitted to wear Russian emblems on their clothing nor display the Russian flag.
*21:10.900- 21:17.000* :  Belarusians will also be allowed to take part under those conditions. Ukraine has responded to the
*21:17.000- 21:22.460* :  ruling saying that allowing Russians to compete just prolongs the war. Our sports news correspondent
*21:22.460- 21:27.880* :  Alex Kapstik told me more. It's pretty close this isn't in the end, Nick. 74 to 65,
*21:27.880- 21:33.180* :  13 abstentions at this meeting in Bahrain and that was against the motion to slap a full ban
*21:33.180- 21:38.480* :  on Russia who had been barred from all parallel competition since the invasion of Ukraine.
*21:38.560- 21:42.940* :  They then came back for a second vote on whether they should compete under neutral conditions
*21:43.020- 21:48.620* :  and that was much more emphatic 90 to 56 in favour and it means that individual Russian athletes
*21:49.260- 21:53.840* :  who haven't shown support for the war in Ukraine and they'll have to participate without
*21:53.840- 22:00.140* :  wearing their national team gear. There may be no anthems or flags. Teams are not allowed
*22:00.140- 22:06.180* :  and there was a similar decision regarding Belarus. And Alex, this was the Paralympic Committee's decision.
*22:06.180- 22:10.620* :  What about the Paris Olympics? Yeah, it doesn't affect what will happen at the Paris Olympics. The
*22:10.620- 22:15.360* :  IPC and the IOC, that's the international limit committee, they're very separate organisations
*22:15.360- 22:20.540* :  but I do think today's events give us a pretty strong indication of which way the wind is
*22:20.540- 22:25.460* :  blowing here. The IOC have been encouraging individual sports to welcome back athletes from
*22:25.460- 22:30.420* :  Russia and Belarus, albeit under a strict conditions in neutrality. Their president Thomas
*22:30.420- 22:34.800* :  back keeps repeating his mantra that sportsmen and women should not be punished for the actions
*22:34.800- 22:39.800* :  of political leaders. But the decision, as I said, is not expected until next year, although they
*22:39.800- 22:44.960* :  are meeting to discuss this in Mumbai at their annual meeting next month. I should say there's
*22:44.960- 22:51.200* :  been criticism of the decision by the IPC to include Russian and Belarusian athletes. Paralympics
*22:51.200- 22:57.340* :  GB said it was disappointed and global athletes, which says it represents athletes for around the
*22:57.340- 23:03.280* :  world, accused the IPC of lacking reason and principle and said that it was lending its support
*23:03.280- 23:08.320* :  to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. And Alex, on an entirely different matter, another controversial
*23:08.320- 23:14.200* :  difficult decision has been made with regard to whether or not hijabs or head coverings
*23:14.440- 23:19.500* :  can be worn at the games by some Muslim women. Well, this follows a decision and announcement by
*23:19.500- 23:26.040* :  the French sports ministry that French athletes would not be allowed to wear headscarves or hijabs,
*23:26.580- 23:31.380* :  which was in line with the country's regime of strict secularism. The IOC has responded by saying,
*23:31.380- 23:35.840* :  as you say, that they will be allowed. Certainly in the athletes village, delegations athletes from
*23:35.840- 23:41.880* :  all countries will be allowed to wear a veil of hijab, as far as competition sporting competitions
*23:41.880- 23:46.080* :  are involved. Well, that's a decision for the individual sports and that's based on safety,
*23:46.080- 23:52.140* :  but French athletes will not be allowed to wear hijabs at the Olympics. Alex Kapstik.
*23:52.620- 23:57.720* :  An international trial has found that some men who undergo treatment for prostate cancer could safely
*23:57.720- 24:03.360* :  be given far less radiotherapy. The trials, which were led by a team in London, found that by changing
*24:03.360- 24:09.100* :  the timings of the treatment, doses could be cut by three-quarters. Doctors say it's fantastic news
*24:09.100- 24:12.900* :  for patients and could ease pressure on the National Health Service here in Britain.
*24:13.480- 24:18.120* :  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men around the world with more than a million
*24:18.120- 24:25.200* :  new diagnoses every year, or details from our medical editor, Fergus Walsh. Nearly 900 men in the UK,
*24:25.200- 24:32.060* :  Ireland and Canada took part in the trial. All had medium risk prostate cancer, which had not spread.
*24:32.800- 24:39.440* :  They got either five high doses of multiple beam radiotherapy or at least 20 doses of standard
*24:39.440- 24:46.980* :  radiotherapy. Both groups did really well with around 95% of patients being cancer-free after five
*24:46.980- 24:52.460* :  years with few side effects. The results will be released at a conference in the US.
*24:53.460- 25:00.060* :  Alistair Kennedy Rose was in the five dose group. It was almost as though I'd never had prostate
*25:00.060- 25:07.460* :  cancer because I didn't have any symptoms to start with and the treatment was so easy,
*25:08.640- 25:14.700* :  ultimately so very effective. The international trial was led by Professor Nicholas Van As.
*25:15.040- 25:19.460* :  When I got the results, I was luchy, I was blown away. I mean, it was probably one of the best days
*25:19.460- 25:24.740* :  in my career. I think it's fantastic news for patients. He expected it could apply to 8,000
*25:24.740- 25:30.520* :  men a year in the UK. He'll be able to have all their treatment in a week with many fewer
*25:30.520- 25:36.840* :  hospital visits. It should also mean fewer men receiving hormone therapy, which is used to help
*25:36.840- 25:44.920* :  stop cancer from coming back, but can cause extreme fatigue, hot flushes and low libido. None of the
*25:44.920- 25:51.160* :  men on the trial received any hormone therapy and for nearly all their prostate cancer did not
*25:51.160- 25:59.260* :  rick her. Fergus Walsh. The sound of mucus is how the actor Christopher Plummer is said to have
*25:59.260- 26:05.660* :  derided the 1965 film that probably made his name, The Sound of Music. In it, he starred as Captain
*26:05.660- 26:11.200* :  Von Trapp leading his family across the Alps fleeing the Nazis with Julie Andrews in tow.
*26:11.960- 26:16.640* :  The film of the musical was an enormous hit, but not because of Mr. Plummer's singing,
*26:16.640- 26:22.800* :  his voice was swapped for a singer Bill Lee when the film was released. But now it's a case of
*26:22.800- 26:29.260* :  so long farewell, Bill Lee, because a new release of the film will have Christopher Plummer's voice
*26:29.260- 26:35.100* :  put back in its rightful place. Mike Matasino is the man performing the remix magic.
*26:50.320- 26:53.360* :  Johnny Diamond asked him how it all came about. He went into the project not really keen on
*26:53.360- 27:01.000* :  doing a musical, but he wanted to work on his singing voice so that he could do them on Broadway,
*27:01.000- 27:07.260* :  which he eventually did. So he pre-recorded the songs as playback, sang to his own voice during
*27:07.260- 27:11.440* :  filming, and took vocal lessons all through production.
*27:25.360- 27:30.540* :  He just felt when he heard them in agreement with the director and the associate producer
*27:30.540- 27:36.820* :  Saul Chaplin that it just wasn't quite working with his voice besides Julie Andrews, and it should
*27:36.820- 27:41.820* :  be replaced and dubbed. So he agreed because I think some versions of the story have it that he was
*27:41.820- 27:48.240* :  really hacked off. No, I have the memos to back that up, so all of that was just hearsay or people
*27:48.240- 27:53.060* :  creating a drama where there wasn't any. And voice doubles were pretty common. It was common,
*27:53.060- 27:59.060* :  but it was also a verbotent subject and the people who did it had to remain anonymous until early
*27:59.060- 28:05.100* :  1964 where there was actually an exposé about it. And the center of that was Marny Nickin, who was
*28:05.100- 28:10.220* :  probably the most famous of the vocal doubles having done The King and I and West Side Story.
*28:23.060- 28:27.640* :  Then the whole thing just sort of gradually opened up a bit, but it wasn't until many, many years
*28:27.640- 28:31.220* :  later where they could really be publicly acknowledged or credited.
*28:31.720- 28:38.200* :  So instead of Christopher Plumber, the version that everybody knows and so many people love
*28:38.820- 28:43.720* :  was in fact sung by a completely different voice. It was by Bill Lee, yeah.
*28:43.820- 28:48.940* :  It was Bill Lee who was very, very known as a vocal double. What did Bill Lee have that Christopher
*28:48.940- 28:49.720* :  Plumber did know?
*28:57.840- 29:05.240* :  Just a polish and the ability to do the long sustained notes that Plumber wasn't up to matching.
*29:13.880- 29:20.940* :  So it was a matter of that polish and particularly in the sustained notes and the
*29:20.940- 29:25.680* :  timbre and just the overall quality and resonance of the voice.
*29:33.080- 29:39.480* :  In which case people will be wondering why now bring Christopher Plumber back?
*29:40.040- 29:46.660* :  Well only because this project was an attempt to really do the ultimate version of the sound
*29:46.660- 29:53.180* :  of music soundtrack as a complete treasury of everything that has survived and we're talking
*29:53.180- 29:57.420* :  about nearly 60 years. So now fans can hear it and decide for themselves.
*29:57.740- 30:02.980* :  Christopher Plumber had a fairly notorious relationship with the film. What do you think about it?
*30:03.720- 30:08.380* :  Well when I first met him which was in 1993 and he sat down for the interview for the documentary I
*30:08.380- 30:14.260* :  did for the 30th anniversary, he gave a beautiful interview and that marked a kind of turnaround
*30:14.300- 30:16.980* :  where he started looking at it in a different light.
*30:17.340- 30:21.260* :  Some people think it's a very sentimental film but I think it's sentimental in the proper way.
*30:22.020- 30:28.560* :  It seemed light and fluffy at the time but once he saw just how meaningful it was to people
*30:28.560- 30:33.660* :  and the longevity that it had. I mean I think he just came to accept his role in it and
*30:50.400- 30:50.660* :  that what they did was right.
*30:50.740- 30:56.680* :  The film, the historian Mike Matacino ending that report on the remixed sound of music film.
*30:59.360- 31:03.380* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:03.800- 31:08.260* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*31:08.260- 31:13.780* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. This edition was mixed by Chris Lovelock,
*31:14.000- 31:19.280* :  the producer with Liam Schaffrey, the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nick Miles and until next time, goodbye.
