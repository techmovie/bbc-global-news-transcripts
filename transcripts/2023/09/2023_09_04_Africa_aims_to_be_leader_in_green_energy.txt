01:11.720 - 01:16.980:  this podcast. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:16.980 - 01:24.080:  I'm Robin Brandt and at 13 hours GMT on the 4th of September, these are our main stories.
01:24.860 - 01:29.560:  The Kenyan President has opened Africa's first climate summit, urging fellow leaders to
01:29.560 - 01:33.260:  focus on solutions rather than who's to blame for global warming.
01:33.800 - 01:39.240:  Zimbabwe's President Emerson Munungagua is being sworn in despite concerns about the credibility
01:39.240 - 01:43.960:  of last month's election. And Ukraine has a new defence minister. We'll get more from
01:43.960 - 01:46.640:  Kiev on the man charged with leading the war effort.
01:49.540 - 01:54.320:  Also in this podcast, the Wales do a huge amount for us when it comes to keeping our oceans
01:54.320 - 01:58.100:  healthy. It's bad for our reputation. It's bad for animal welfare.
01:58.620 - 02:01.640:  There's anger as Iceland resumes commercial wailing.
02:07.520 - 02:12.440:  Now climate change is seriously threatening to Africa with the continent viewed as the most
02:12.440 - 02:17.880:  vulnerable from the impact of environmental changes. In light of that, leaders from across
02:17.880 - 02:23.100:  Africa are gathering in Kenya for a summit aimed at promoting renewable energy and a shared
02:23.100 - 02:28.460:  vision for sustainable development. The host Kenya's President William Ruto said they should seek
02:28.460 - 02:33.840:  solutions, though, rather than catalogue grievances and problems. A chief Africa correspondent
02:33.840 - 02:38.700:  Ann Sawy is at the conference. I asked her what we can expect from the African leaders meeting
02:39.760 - 02:45.500:  today to build consensus and to speak with one voice when they go to the COP28, the UN Climate
02:45.500 - 02:51.000:  Summit that's upcoming in Dubai in November. And so they hope to discuss ideas that they will be
02:51.000 - 02:56.960:  taking to the table. The host President Ruto has been very keen for Africa to be proactive.
02:58.000 - 03:03.820:  He said this morning during the opening meeting that they're not here to list grievances.
03:03.820 - 03:10.500:  They're here to find solutions. You have not just stepped into a conference hall. You have
03:10.500 - 03:18.680:  entered the future. A future ripe with potential driven by global partnerships committed
03:19.540 - 03:25.960:  to African prosperity, inclusive growth and a livable planet for all of us.
03:26.480 - 03:30.320:  Now as ever with these conferences, it needs the most important people there. So are the most
03:30.320 - 03:35.880:  important influential people there? To a large extent, yes. I would have expected to see more
03:35.880 - 03:42.420:  African heads of state. We're having just about half of them here. We have experts. We have
03:42.880 - 03:47.940:  other delegates, including activists. So we're expecting very vibrant discussions over the next
03:47.980 - 03:53.280:  three days. They hope there will be consensus. They hope they will have an aerobic
03:53.280 - 03:58.960:  declaration. However, there are issues. There are contentious. For instance, carbon trading that's
03:58.960 - 04:04.400:  a very contentious issue here. And also activists just saying that some of the leaders are not
04:04.400 - 04:10.900:  putting everything they can to fight climate change. So what does it they actually want to get to
04:10.900 - 04:16.160:  by the end of three days' time? Is this going to be clear decorations they can take to Dubai
04:16.300 - 04:21.800:  later in the year? Yes, absolutely. So they hope to come up with that
04:21.800 - 04:26.200:  aerobic declaration. And already the Canadian president, the host of this meeting,
04:26.200 - 04:31.400:  has sort of set out the agenda, saying that they want to look at what African can offer what
04:31.400 - 04:36.600:  solutions they can take to the table. They're looking at the minerals that they have on the continent
04:36.600 - 04:44.420:  which are used to drive their move towards green energy, electric vehicles. He drove himself
04:44.420 - 04:50.540:  yesterday and today to the conference in an electric car to make the point. They're also looking
04:50.540 - 04:56.300:  at financing solutions and discussing some of them. He has arged countries that made commitments
04:56.300 - 05:02.660:  during previous climate summits to finance climate solutions, but haven't come through. He has
05:02.660 - 05:08.540:  arged them to make good their commitment to fulfill their commitments. And soy in Nairobi.
05:08.980 - 05:13.880:  Ukraine says Russia has carried out a huge drone attack against the port city of Ishmael
05:13.880 - 05:19.280:  on the River Danube from where agricultural products were being exported. Official say warehouses
05:19.280 - 05:23.640:  and other infrastructure have been damaged. His are diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams.
05:24.440 - 05:28.780:  Russia has been hitting Ukraine's port facilities along the Danube River for over a month,
05:28.780 - 05:34.140:  trying to prevent Ukraine from using the river to export its grain. With last year's UN
05:34.140 - 05:39.320:  brokered Black Sea grain initiative on hold and being discussed today at talks between Vladimir
05:39.320 - 05:44.280:  Putin and Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Moscow doesn't want Ukraine to develop
05:44.280 - 05:50.620:  viable alternative routes. In the latest air attacks overnight, Ukraine says two Russian kamikaze
05:50.620 - 05:56.160:  drones fell on the other side of the Danube River inside Romanian territory. Romania seems
05:56.160 - 06:00.740:  to be denying this. The defense ministry in Bucharest condemned the latest Russian attacks,
06:00.740 - 06:04.980:  but said they did not pose any direct military threat against Romania.
06:05.300 - 06:10.100:  Paul Adams reporting. Next, let's go to the occupied west bank city of Janine, where Israeli
06:10.100 - 06:15.380:  security forces have targeted a refugee camp wounding several Palestinians. In July,
06:15.380 - 06:21.220:  a similar raid in Janine killed at least 17 Palestinians and it led to widespread unrest.
06:21.700 - 06:24.980:  On the Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman told me the latest from Jerusalem.
06:25.740 - 06:30.820:  We know the Palestinian Ministry of Health has said at least four people sent to hospitals in
06:30.820 - 06:36.000:  Janine. Most of those look like minor injuries, but it seems that two of the militants that were
06:36.000 - 06:40.980:  involved in a gun battle with the Israelis may well have more significant injuries. We saw
06:40.980 - 06:46.420:  pictures of at least one of those being stretched away by Israeli troops into a helicopter after
06:46.420 - 06:52.900:  he had been detained by the Israelis. In terms of what happened on the ground, I mean, this started
06:52.900 - 07:00.400:  as so many of these raids have over the last year or so as an entrance into the city by undercover
07:01.120 - 07:06.680:  Israeli special forces. Sometimes they go in things like dairy trucks. This time it seems they
07:06.680 - 07:10.860:  went in Palestinian vehicles with Palestinian license plates, but at some point their cover was
07:10.860 - 07:15.800:  blown. They were then being shot at by Palestinian militants from the Al-Qasam Brigades. That's
07:15.800 - 07:20.840:  the armed wing of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. From the building, it seems the Israelis
07:20.840 - 07:26.180:  were targeting. And significantly, some of those injuries have come from, according to
07:26.180 - 07:31.560:  Unconfirmed, Israeli reports, an explosive drone or a so-called suicide drone that it seems
07:31.560 - 07:36.640:  as used above or near to a vehicle causing injuries among those militants. The militant group
07:36.640 - 07:42.540:  itself has said that it claimed that it shot down the drone. Pictures of part of a drone have
07:42.540 - 07:48.020:  emerged online since then. So I think what you're seeing is this sort of ever-increasing sense of
07:48.020 - 07:54.920:  militarization, the use of increasingly heavy lethal force, once again, in Janine. As the
07:54.920 - 08:00.440:  West Bank continues this slide into further bloodshed. It's the simplest of questions, but maybe
08:00.440 - 08:04.500:  the most important. Just remind us, why does Israel feel the need to launch these raids,
08:04.500 - 08:11.400:  incursions like this? Well, Janine is one of two cities in the north of the West Bank alongside
08:11.640 - 08:18.540:  Nablus. The over the last 18 months to two years have seen the official Palestinian Authority.
08:18.540 - 08:23.860:  Now that's the internationally backed organization that has limited governance powers in the West
08:23.860 - 08:28.500:  Bank. It's seen the PA has lost control of some of these cities to arm militants. Now many
08:28.500 - 08:34.200:  Palestinians see them as a heartland of resistance to Israel's occupation. The Israelis call them hubs
08:34.200 - 08:38.800:  of terrorism. And as we see increasing attacks against Israelis, they've been launching increasingly
08:38.800 - 08:44.260:  lethal military raids into these cities. They say to apprehend gunmen, in many cases, we're seeing
08:44.300 - 08:50.520:  gun battles and militants dying and civilians as well. Tom Bateman speaking to me from Jerusalem.
08:51.080 - 08:56.020:  Now, in Zimbabwe, the president, Emerson Munungagua, has delivered his inauguration speech after
08:56.020 - 09:02.340:  he was sworn in for a second term. I stand before you, my fellow Zimbabweans and countrymen
09:02.340 - 09:10.580:  women. And this historic moment of our nation as the president of all Zimbabweans,
09:10.980 - 09:17.760:  regardless of tribe, religion, color, creed or political persuasion.
09:18.160 - 09:22.700:  There have been concerns, though, over the credibility of last month's election with analysts
09:22.700 - 09:27.440:  in the region claiming the poll failed to meet democratic standards. They also claim it fell
09:27.440 - 09:32.960:  short of Zimbabwe's own constitution. Well, I was in Babwe Correspondent, Shingay and Nyoka has been
09:32.960 - 09:39.220:  following the ceremony and told me more. Well, what has happened so far is that President Emerson
09:39.220 - 09:47.500:  Munungagua has been sworn in. He was sworn in by the Chief Justice in front of tens of thousands
09:47.500 - 09:53.600:  of supporters. And there was a celebration with some of his favorite music after that.
09:54.000 - 09:59.860:  But I think it's quite interesting to note who was there, regional leaders, despite the fact that
09:59.860 - 10:05.600:  the election observer missions from those various countries said that this election fell short
10:05.600 - 10:11.920:  of democratic standards. Notably, President Cyril Ramaposa is there as well as the most
10:11.920 - 10:19.600:  unbeacon president, Philippe Nusse, and former First Lady Grace Mugabe. And so it really seems
10:19.600 - 10:27.120:  as if Zimbabwe president Munungagua is moving on despite the fact that this election when was
10:27.120 - 10:33.880:  disputed, the opposition we understand was invited to attend and they declined. They still maintain
10:33.880 - 10:39.600:  that they want fresh elections. But given that this inauguration has gone ahead, he's been sworn in.
10:39.600 - 10:43.180:  It's not just not clear what other options they have now.
10:43.420 - 10:47.300:  Do you see this definitely as a vote of confidence from South Africa and others
10:48.680 - 10:53.600:  in Emerson Munungagua's leadership? Not so much a vote of confidence, but just
10:55.420 - 11:02.620:  support for his government. It would have been very difficult given the proximity of these countries
11:02.620 - 11:09.840:  and historic relationships, historical relationships between them for these leaders not to attend.
11:09.900 - 11:16.320:  What is not clear is what happens now, whether these leaders are going to pressure Emerson
11:16.320 - 11:22.020:  Munungagua to implement some of the reforms that were spelled out by the election observer
11:22.020 - 11:29.920:  missions or reforms around some of the laws as well as whether he's going to or they're going to
11:29.920 - 11:36.200:  try and press upon him to bring about some kind of unity to unite this very divided country.
11:36.580 - 11:43.200:  As Zimbabwe correspondent Shinge Inaka, after a two-month ban on wailing, Icelandic boats have been
11:43.200 - 11:48.580:  given an authorization to hunt thin whales again, but with new guidelines aimed at killing them
11:48.580 - 11:53.680:  as quickly as possible to reduce suffering. The temporary suspension came in after it was found
11:53.680 - 11:58.540:  that the culling of the whales was taking too long and it was in breach of animal welfare laws.
11:59.140 - 12:03.920:  The controversial move has angered conservation activists and caused a political storm on the
12:03.920 - 12:09.700:  island nation, one of three countries alongside Norway and Japan where wailing is still legal.
12:10.400 - 12:12.780:  Adrienne Murray sent this report from Iceland.
12:14.520 - 12:21.220:  In Reykjavik Harbour, an old wailing boat maneuvers into dock. It's been readying to head out to sea
12:21.680 - 12:27.980:  and go hunting. Earlier this summer the practice was suspended over animal welfare concerns.
12:28.940 - 12:34.140:  But within Iceland, the sudden stoppage caused a political round and now the government has
12:34.140 - 12:41.140:  let wailing restart. The midst of food, agriculture and fisheries, Svandis Vavadotti said she's done
12:41.140 - 12:48.700:  so reluctantly. This discussion is far from over. I think it is important that it continues in
12:48.700 - 12:54.360:  the society as a whole and in politics. We are the last nation in the world that allows hunting
12:54.360 - 13:00.420:  of whales in this way. Animal rights activists and environmentalists have condemned the move.
13:00.420 - 13:06.680:  In Reykjavik doesn't gather to protest, including Icelandic actress and activist here at Hillmont.
13:06.680 - 13:12.180:  It's a very sad day. I'm not really proud to be an Icelandic citizen today.
13:13.380 - 13:17.380:  But at the same time I am because the majority of us really doesn't want this
13:17.660 - 13:23.060:  and it's actually fighting this. We don't eat the meat. The whales do a huge amount for us when
13:23.060 - 13:27.960:  it comes to keeping our oceans healthy. It's bad for our reputation, it's bad for animal welfare.
13:28.360 - 13:33.860:  An injunction has been filed in a bid to block further wailing and some Hollywood filmmakers and actors
13:34.320 - 13:38.380:  like Leonardo DiCaprio and James Cameron have called for it to stop.
13:40.080 - 13:45.600:  Finwells are listed as vulnerable globally but stocks in Iceland are reportedly stable.
13:46.520 - 13:51.200:  Only one wailing station still hunts them and exports the meat to Japan.
13:52.120 - 13:58.660:  The favela says it won't hang up its harpoons anytime soon. Christian Nofson is the owner.
13:59.100 - 14:06.560:  If you have a healthy stock of fish or whales, you utilize them. If the stocks are not healthy,
14:06.560 - 14:12.920:  you don't utilize them. They're as simple as that. And we have about a stock estimate for Finwells
14:13.080 - 14:21.220:  around Iceland. It's about 40,000 animals. It quotas about 160. So this is a resource
14:21.220 - 14:28.140:  utilization. Critics would argue that the way whales have been hunted hasn't been humanly done.
14:38.200 - 14:43.300:  Just two other countries, Norway and Japan, still allow commercial wailing. In 1986,
14:43.340 - 14:49.520:  there was a global moratorium due to dwindling whale stocks. I son halted the practice shortly
14:49.520 - 14:56.260:  after restarted again in 2006. Around the world, commercial wailing has most have been
14:56.260 - 15:02.680:  consigned to the history books, but here in Iceland, it remains a highly emotive issue.
15:03.660 - 15:08.840:  In recent years, the views of Icelanders have undergone a sea change and the latest poll
15:08.840 - 15:16.360:  shows 42% are against it, while 29% remain in favour. It's totally against animal rights.
15:16.460 - 15:24.020:  It's totally against biodiversity of the sea, of the ocean. Allowing wailing in Iceland is like,
15:24.480 - 15:29.660:  you know, the Icelandic nation is not giving anything from it. It's just this one company,
15:29.660 - 15:36.160:  and we're going for one. And why? In general, I think most Icelanders are against it,
15:36.220 - 15:41.340:  but there is, you know, other parts of Iceland that sort of see it if it's done in a sustainable
15:41.340 - 15:47.720:  manner. It's, it provides occupation for a local population in a small town. It was handled very
15:47.720 - 15:57.660:  poorly. The minister of the sea affairs did a very poor job on my opinion. It was a very short
15:57.660 - 16:06.280:  notice that he said no, and now he has to turn around and allow it. In downtown Reykjavit,
16:06.280 - 16:09.660:  chef Stefan Uffersen runs fish restaurant through Eiffracker.
16:09.960 - 16:15.080:  We make whales and sea meat, and it's influenced by Japanese, and we have whale pepper steak.
16:15.300 - 16:21.000:  He says, well dishes will stay on the menu. We have local customers, and then a lot of tourists
16:21.080 - 16:24.460:  I would like to very curious about to tasting it.
16:25.340 - 16:28.520:  And here we go. We are not being killed now. I don't know.
16:32.140 - 16:37.800:  But while whaling has been done for centuries, wanting for visitors now go whale watching,
16:38.660 - 16:44.140:  and it's a chance to see these creatures in the world, it's becoming one of Iceland's biggest
16:44.140 - 16:48.620:  fools. Adrian Murray reporting from Iceland.
16:51.400 - 16:56.000:  Still to come. Sometimes they feel so hungry, and when they look at other children,
16:56.000 - 16:59.740:  they don't suffer. Sometimes they think that I have no reason to leave.
17:00.100 - 17:05.060:  Children are being forced into sexual exploitation because of the global rise in the cost of living,
17:05.280 - 17:06.040:  according to the UN.
17:14.500 - 17:18.880:  Unexpected elements is the podcast that sifts through the week's news to unearth
17:18.940 - 17:23.700:  surprising nuggets of science. I really wanted to look at an animal that as far as we could tell
17:23.700 - 17:28.600:  at least, doesn't seem to age. Okay, you have my attention tell me more, and uncover the
17:28.680 - 17:33.100:  unexpected connections between them. I think now's the good time to talk about worms.
17:33.100 - 17:38.860:  Really? Worms? Absolutely. Unexpected elements from the BBC World Service.
17:38.860 - 17:42.660:  Amazing stuff. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
17:44.640 - 17:46.620:  Hello again, this is the Global News Podcast.
17:47.620 - 17:53.220:  Children are being forced into sexual exploitation and other forms of harmful work because of
17:53.220 - 17:57.680:  the global rise in the cost of living. That's according to the United Nations. The claims come
17:57.680 - 18:03.160:  from its agency, the international labour organisation, and they echo similar concerns that
18:03.160 - 18:08.660:  have been raised by NGO workers in Kenya about the measures that some families there take to survive.
18:09.320 - 18:14.000:  From Mombasa, our correspondent Barbara Plett Asher has more, and just to warn you,
18:14.060 - 18:16.400:  you may find some of the details that follow, distressing.
18:20.060 - 18:25.560:  Mombasa is a port city, of course, and I'm down by the entrance to the sea. I've just seen
18:26.080 - 18:32.440:  a lot of people streaming onto a ferry. This has long been a well-known hub for child sex tourism.
18:33.060 - 18:37.780:  But COVID and the increasingly harsh cost of living have helped to push the sex trade
18:38.400 - 18:43.300:  online and even further underground, and that's been drawing even more children into the industry.
18:46.680 - 18:49.620:  In a wooden shack with the sun shining through gaps in the roof,
18:50.100 - 18:52.460:  I meet a mother who's had to make a painful decision.
18:54.900 - 18:58.860:  She takes in washing a few times a week to support her three children and does it
18:58.860 - 19:04.980:  what does to use her name. The money for school fees quickly runs out. She says there's barely
19:04.980 - 19:11.700:  enough for food, so her 14-year-old daughter has to find work. She started selling her body.
19:14.880 - 19:20.360:  As a parent, it's not easy to tell a child to do something like that. I would like her to go
19:20.360 - 19:26.280:  to school like other children, but because I don't have any means, she's forced to do that job.
19:26.280 - 19:32.620:  Mahatch's broke him, and I don't want it to continue. She's not the only one. We've spoken
19:32.620 - 19:37.420:  with a woman who runs a brothel. She told us she's been getting more and more young girls.
19:40.880 - 19:46.280:  At this shelter, there is a rare moment of joy that children are celebrating a birthday party.
19:47.300 - 19:52.160:  They're here because they were abused, abandoned, trafficked, or forced into the sex trade.
19:52.160 - 19:57.700:  Grace O'Demba runs this center and two others. They're struggling to meet the growing needs.
19:58.340 - 20:06.240:  Now, everyone wants to survive. They've been giving away their children for exchange of money.
20:06.460 - 20:08.800:  And has it always been that way or is it more so now?
20:09.080 - 20:12.760:  Now it's more so because there is no money, there is no job.
20:13.400 - 20:17.920:  It's the poorest canyons who've been hit the hardest, and there are those who are ready to take
20:23.020 - 20:27.120:  advantage of this. This undercover police unit is cracking down on the dark trade in child sex.
20:27.620 - 20:31.220:  Here, raiding the home of a man who's supposed to defensive material on the internet.
20:33.180 - 20:38.100:  Officers track down suspects using cyber tips from a database in the United States.
20:38.300 - 20:42.960:  Then they search phones and computer drives for explicit material about children.
20:43.700 - 20:48.680:  It's exhausting, traumatic work, up against a business that thrives in Mombasa.
20:48.880 - 20:56.000:  You find that there are poor families following the whites for support sex tourism?
20:56.460 - 20:56.720:  Yes.
20:57.520 - 21:02.660:  Motesia Moeni is in charge of the unit. She says there's no data on whether the recent cost of
21:02.660 - 21:07.580:  living crisis has driven more children into the sex trade, but her team has begun monitoring it.
21:07.800 - 21:14.560:  You would say that unemployment, there are so many children that are dropping out of school,
21:14.680 - 21:19.060:  and then you find that they're getting to this especially in the coastal region.
21:21.800 - 21:26.680:  One girl who hasn't escaped the streets told me about the despair that shapes her young life.
21:27.360 - 21:29.480:  We're using her words, but not her voice.
21:30.200 - 21:35.420:  I am afraid because I know that when you're sleeping with a man, you can get HIV or become
21:35.420 - 21:41.020:  pregnant. Sometimes they feel so hungry, and when they look at other children, they don't suffer.
21:41.480 - 21:43.800:  Sometimes they think that I have no reason to leave.
21:44.760 - 21:49.840:  She's trapped by an economy of depravity that feeds on desperation.
21:50.680 - 21:54.320:  Barbara Plett-Asha reporting from the port city of Mombasa.
21:55.360 - 22:00.480:  Thousands of teachers across South Korea have walked out because of mounting anger over pressure
22:00.480 - 22:04.040:  from parents, which they say is leading in the most extreme instances,
22:04.620 - 22:09.960:  to teachers taking their own lives. The death of a young teacher who died by suicide and was
22:09.960 - 22:14.420:  found in a school cupboard in July prompted weekly vigils and demonstrations.
22:15.180 - 22:19.560:  Teachers have stayed away from work on mass today and headed to rallies instead.
22:19.560 - 22:22.900:  Our correspondent Jean McKenzie was at one of them and she told me more.
22:23.220 - 22:27.680:  I'm now at the heart of this protest where thousands of teachers have turned up today.
22:27.680 - 22:32.400:  They're all dressed in black and this is because not only are they protesting because they want
22:32.400 - 22:38.100:  this better protection at work, but they're also here to commemorate this teacher who died now
22:38.100 - 22:44.980:  49 days ago. This is a kind of moment to mark in Buddhism where you mark the 49th day after
22:44.980 - 22:48.840:  somebody's death. That's why they're all dressed in black. These protests have been huge now
22:48.840 - 22:54.640:  for about six weeks and one of the weekend on Saturday gathered at a hundred thousand people,
22:54.640 - 22:58.420:  which was rather extraordinary. It's the largest one we've seen. Today's is smaller because
22:58.920 - 23:04.980:  it's a school day, but ever since teachers have turned up here and they are striking as well,
23:04.980 - 23:09.400:  so a lot of them have managed to get off school to be here. It's hard to get into a brief answer,
23:09.400 - 23:15.000:  but just give us an idea of what life is like and the pressures that are faced by teachers in South
23:15.000 - 23:23.800:  Korea. So really the death of this one teacher opens this Pandora's box here. Suddenly you had
23:23.800 - 23:29.160:  teachers from all over the country just coming forward and sharing these stories of how they were
23:29.160 - 23:36.380:  being harassed by what they would say as overbearing parents who are just so fixated on their children's
23:36.580 - 23:41.300:  success. So they're guessing they say these incessant complaints from parents all hours of the day
23:41.720 - 23:47.320:  on their personal mobile phones late at night at weekends and it's just giving them no space to
23:47.440 - 23:53.720:  actually teach. But sometimes these complaints are really serious. Teachers are saying that they're
23:53.720 - 23:59.480:  being accused of child abuse if they try to restrain violent children in the classroom. They can
23:59.480 - 24:03.680:  be accused of emotional abuse if they tell children off or they often to leave the classroom because
24:03.680 - 24:09.540:  they're being disruptive. And this taps in to just this wider societal issue here, which is South
24:09.540 - 24:16.780:  Korea is this hyper competitive society and so much here hinges on an academic success. And so parents
24:16.780 - 24:21.200:  feel this huge pressure that their children just have to do well at school. And of course that
24:21.200 - 24:26.380:  pressure is put on to the children and it's being put on to the teachers we're learning. And just
24:26.380 - 24:29.820:  quickly I mean there's a culture there that clearly is not going to change overnight. But what's the
24:29.820 - 24:35.800:  government doing? How is it responded to try and reassure teachers? The government is listening
24:35.800 - 24:40.500:  and it is saying to teachers we are hearing your cries you know it has even accepted that its
24:40.500 - 24:44.900:  classrooms are broken which is a pretty big step for the government here and it's issued this new
24:44.900 - 24:49.140:  guidance from teachers which came into force a couple of days ago which should in theory give
24:49.140 - 24:53.820:  them a bit more control to be able to discipline kids. But the teachers here are saying that they want
24:54.240 - 24:59.260:  a much more kind of systemic reform. They particularly want the government to look at this child
24:59.260 - 25:04.000:  welfare act which they think the parents are exploiting. And this is the act that means if you are
25:04.000 - 25:09.040:  accused of child abuse you can be immediately removed from your jobs. But there are plenty of people
25:09.040 - 25:15.300:  here who say that it isn't just classrooms that are broken. It is South Korea's entire approach to
25:15.300 - 25:21.340:  education that needs to be looked at and reformed. Gene McKenzie in Seoul. Leaders of the world's most
25:21.340 - 25:26.460:  powerful economic nations are gathering in Delhi at the weekend but we now know one very important
25:26.460 - 25:32.400:  person won't be there. China's Xi Jinping is opting out. The G20 summit is supposed to be about
25:32.400 - 25:37.620:  tackling global economic challenges but China's president currently in charge of the world's
25:37.820 - 25:43.240:  troubled number two economy isn't going. Arasia Pacific editor Michael Bristow is following
25:43.240 - 25:48.620:  developments. We've just got a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry essentially confirming
25:48.620 - 25:54.320:  what we'd heard through rumors for the last few days that Lee Chang the premier of China will be
25:54.320 - 26:00.200:  going in his place. We can only speculate why Xi Jinping won't be going. One of the reasons could
26:00.240 - 26:06.320:  be a major one. It could be that China has decided to pivot away from the G20 a group of many
26:07.160 - 26:13.860:  disparate countries with different political ideals underpinning them and China could be
26:14.380 - 26:18.400:  moving towards groupings which it can control which it feels more in tune with Seoul.
26:18.820 - 26:24.740:  For example the Bricks group of nations that's just had a summit in South Africa which Xi Jinping
26:24.740 - 26:31.340:  did attend to. It could also be that Xi Jinping does want to go to India where the G20 summit is
26:31.340 - 26:37.900:  being held. India and China over recent years have had strange relations, clashes along their
26:37.900 - 26:43.020:  border. Xi Jinping might not want to go to New Delhi so hold kinds of reasons but we're not entirely
26:43.020 - 26:48.060:  sure why because the Chinese foreign ministry hasn't told us. No, a baker's ever in Beijing.
26:49.200 - 26:53.940:  What about global diplomacy in the prospect which has been much talk about of Joe Biden
26:53.940 - 26:58.720:  and Xi Jinping sitting down on the periphery of India? That clearly isn't going to happen now.
26:58.980 - 27:03.060:  I mean that's disappointing for the Americans isn't it? It's disappointing and it's significant.
27:03.060 - 27:08.540:  These are the two biggest countries in the world. Their leaders have only met once before since
27:08.540 - 27:14.820:  President Biden took office and that was interestingly at the last G20 summit meeting in Bali.
27:14.820 - 27:19.520:  So President Biden was hoping that he perhaps could sit down with Xi Jinping at this event
27:19.900 - 27:27.240:  so already expressed his disappointment not being able to do that. So that was a major potential
27:27.240 - 27:32.800:  major development at this G20. It's also a loss for the summit as well I think because as you
27:32.800 - 27:39.420:  indicated there China is completely at the moment going through very difficult economic difficulties.
27:40.060 - 27:46.240:  It's a second biggest economy in the world and for it not to be there really hampers the G20's
27:46.240 - 27:51.300:  ability to deal with those major economic problems facing the world at the moment. Michael Bristol
27:51.300 - 27:55.780:  reporting and just with the record Xi Jinping won't be going but China's premier Li Chang
27:55.780 - 28:02.220:  number two in the pecking order will be there in his place. Okay let's end on dogs yes real dogs
28:02.220 - 28:07.820:  because some have taken part in a performance at a classical music concert in Denmark. Now it may
28:07.820 - 28:13.680:  sound barking but organizers insist it was what the writer would have wanted. I'm going to stop there
28:22.740 - 28:27.820:  and let David Lewis explain. It may sound like a wolfgang but actually it's a Mozart.
28:34.620 - 28:40.300:  The hunting symphony was written by Leopold Mozart Amadeus's father and is opening the
28:40.300 - 28:46.460:  hidden classical music festival near Copenhagen. The conductor says he's fulfilling the composer's
28:46.460 - 28:53.880:  dream. Mozart's senior said that six bars not bucks should be accompanied by baying hounds.
28:54.420 - 29:00.640:  So how did organizers find the musical maestro moths? Well dozens of dogs were invited to audition
29:00.640 - 29:07.680:  back in the spring. Pets perform for a jury including the festival director and an animal trainer.
29:07.680 - 29:14.600:  The chief executive officer of the Danish Chamber Orchestra Andreas Vato was also there. He
29:14.600 - 29:20.340:  explained how the show would work. The symphony is in three movements and in the last movements we
29:20.340 - 29:27.160:  will hear the hunt to begin and we'll have shootings and then the dogs will start to bag around
29:27.160 - 29:32.440:  the scenes and we will have three dogs on his signal that will bag around the orchestra.
29:32.740 - 29:38.740:  Auditionees needed to show the right temperament for the part. How long command but stay silent
29:38.740 - 29:43.360:  for the rest of the performance. Poochers were whittled down to just three cookie,
29:43.360 - 29:49.900:  sofas and seeker. After three months of training they were ready. Cookie's owner hella Louvering
29:50.200 - 29:54.860:  said there were no pre-show nerves. If I had to be there by myself I think it would have been nervous
29:55.460 - 30:01.580:  but you know all the attention was at her and you know she's the star. She's the star. I'm just
30:01.580 - 30:08.260:  behind her and know all the treats. The canine's cameo would have an extra benefit. The trio of dogs
30:08.260 - 30:16.800:  taking part would also get four free concert tickets for their humans. David Lewis on Denmark and
30:16.800 - 30:24.240:  dogs let's just leave that one there now. Well that's all from us for now but there will be a
30:24.240 - 30:29.200:  new edition of the global news podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics
