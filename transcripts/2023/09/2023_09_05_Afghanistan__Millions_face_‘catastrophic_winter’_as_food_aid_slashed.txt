00:20.160 - 00:26.080:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they made
00:26.080 - 00:30.340:  their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
00:30.480 - 00:35.700:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos really
00:35.700 - 00:41.340:  did to become the first person in history to pocket $100 billion. Listen to Good Bad Billionaire

00:49.020 - 00:51.740:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:51.740 - 00:59.300:  I'm Robin Brandt and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 5th of September, these are our main stories.
00:59.300 - 01:04.900:  Afghanistan's problems keep mounting. The world food programme is cutting rations to another
01:04.900 - 01:09.820:  two million people there because it's running out of money. A route about school uniforms and
01:09.820 - 01:14.920:  what some Muslim pupils are wearing goes to court in France. And two people have been arrested
01:14.920 - 01:17.900:  after digging a shortcut through the Great Wall of China.
01:21.200 - 01:26.800:  Also in this podcast. You're a fake and a phony and I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.
01:27.460 - 01:32.900:  Pop culture tells us opposites attract when it comes to love but a new study says think again
01:33.240 - 01:34.420:  when you're looking for that partner.
01:40.500 - 01:44.580:  We start in Afghanistan where the people living under the Taliban regime are facing
01:44.580 - 01:50.740:  yet another challenge to daily life. Food insecurity. The World Food Programme says it is
01:50.740 - 01:55.040:  cutting the amount it provides to two million people across the country because of funding
01:55.040 - 02:01.060:  problems and a lack of international support. The L.A. Lee, the WFP director in the country,
02:01.060 - 02:05.020:  said that 15 million people needed food assistance in Afghanistan.
02:05.800 - 02:11.600:  13 million people was kind of our winter planning period and then in May,
02:12.640 - 02:20.060:  we had to reduce 8 million people from assistance. And this month we're having to reduce another
02:20.060 - 02:26.140:  two million. That means 10 million people that we had served previously in who need assistance
02:27.020 - 02:32.120:  are going to bed hungry without any food assistance at WFP is able to provide.
02:32.700 - 02:38.720:  Well, off those millions, Baba Karam in Kabul is one who's been helped by the World Food Programme.
02:42.720 - 02:48.080:  They have just helped us twice. Both times they gave me 3,500 Afghani in cash.
02:48.540 - 02:53.520:  The amount wasn't sufficient but anyway it was fair enough. After the two times they told me
02:53.520 - 02:58.600:  that I don't have rations anymore. I'm so worried about what will happen next now that the assistance
02:58.600 - 03:02.860:  has ended too. I stay awake all night and worry about the future of my children.
03:03.580 - 03:08.580:  Well, I got more on the scale of the growing crisis from our South Asia regional editor
03:08.580 - 03:15.600:  Ambran Sanatiraja. After the takeover of the Taliban in 2021, as you know, many of the businesses
03:15.600 - 03:22.260:  and job opportunities for ordinary Afghans have operated. And many women were forced to leave the
03:22.260 - 03:27.820:  job, for example, in most of the government departments as well as those working for non-governmental
03:27.820 - 03:34.140:  organizations. And also most of the schools have to be reopened for teenage children. So people
03:34.180 - 03:41.000:  are very desperate. As you heard from one of the Afghans there, people are doing daily labor
03:41.000 - 03:46.720:  work to get some money to provide food for their families. For example, the World Food Programme,
03:47.060 - 03:53.540:  it compliments by giving about $38 a month for a family of seven. It's not like every month they
03:53.540 - 03:58.200:  will get depending on situation because in far flung areas and remote districts, people can be
03:58.200 - 04:03.680:  cut off for months because of winter. So they had to be provided food ration or the equivalent amount
04:03.680 - 04:10.000:  of money. Now, Afghanistan needs about $4.5 billion of foreign aid every year to survive because
04:10.000 - 04:14.740:  the economy is shrinking. That is not money coming in because of international sanctions. Now,
04:14.740 - 04:19.600:  the aid agencies say they've got only about 10% of the amount earlier this year. So they're desperately
04:19.600 - 04:26.400:  trying to get more money so that the starving Afghans can be provided help. You know, given the
04:26.400 - 04:30.560:  Taliban administration has not been recognized by the international community, there are many
04:30.560 - 04:36.600:  sanctions in place. So food aid, especially by the UN agencies and other NGOs, provide a key
04:36.600 - 04:42.300:  role in providing help for ordinary Afghans. You said the agencies say they have only about 10%
04:42.300 - 04:48.720:  of the budget that they say they need. Why has the food program had to be cut so drastically by
04:48.720 - 04:55.240:  the WFP? They say that they need about $1 billion at least by the end of October. Winter is
04:55.240 - 04:59.780:  going to be very harsh in Afghanistan. That is where they need more money, more help for people.
05:00.460 - 05:05.540:  Now, that is why they're using this opportunity to give an appeal to the international community
05:05.540 - 05:11.840:  as the UN General Assembly is going to start in a couple of weeks. So, and also the G20 summit is
05:11.840 - 05:16.780:  going to happen in the Indian capital, Delhi. They're reminding the responsibility of the
05:16.780 - 05:21.420:  international community to provide more money to Afghanistan. As you know, attention has been
05:21.420 - 05:27.020:  shifted because of the ongoing war in Ukraine. The world's attention has moved to different places.
05:27.520 - 05:32.160:  That's why they are asking the international community and reminding them about the situation
05:32.160 - 05:40.800:  the Afghans are facing. The United States says the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is expected to
05:40.800 - 05:46.520:  make a rare visit overseas for talks with President Vladimir Putin. Officials in the Biden
05:46.520 - 05:52.000:  administration say Russia is hoping to acquire arms for its ongoing war in Ukraine. The U.S.
05:52.000 - 05:56.760:  State Department said sanctions against Russia had forced it to turn to what it described as rogue
05:56.760 - 06:02.500:  regimes for help. And that any arms deal would violate UN Security Council resolutions.
06:03.300 - 06:07.640:  The New York Times diplomatic correspondent Edward Wong is one of the journalists who worked on
06:07.640 - 06:13.080:  the story. He told the BBC that the information they received points towards a meeting of the two leaders.
06:14.080 - 06:19.900:  Our sources have told us that one of the strong signs that emerged at this meeting would take place
06:19.900 - 06:25.420:  was that there was an advanced team of North Korean officials who traveled to Vladivostok and
06:25.420 - 06:32.380:  then Moscow in late August. And those included security officers who deal with the protocol
06:32.380 - 06:38.580:  of the surrounding travel of the leadership. So that was a strong sign for officials looking at this.
06:38.900 - 06:43.680:  Mr. Wong also explained why Pyongyang might want to supply Russia with munitions.
06:44.740 - 06:50.660:  Our sources tell us that North Korea might be seeking advanced technology from Russia to help
06:50.660 - 06:57.800:  it with its satellite program and a nuclear-powered submarine program. Also, North Korea is one of the
06:57.800 - 07:04.340:  poorest countries in the world. It often goes through bouts of mass hunger and it is seeking food
07:04.340 - 07:08.980:  aid from Russia too. Well, that said, Edward Wong from the New York Times. The BBC's Russia
07:08.980 - 07:14.100:  editor Steve Rosenberg has more details about the current relationship between Russia and North
07:14.220 - 07:20.440:  Korea and Russia's weapon shortages. Yesterday, Russia's defence minister Sergei Shogu
07:20.760 - 07:25.760:  told Russian media his country was discussing the possibility of joint military exercises, though,
07:25.760 - 07:32.120:  with North Korea. And we know that back in July, the same official Sergei Shogu paid a visit
07:32.120 - 07:38.680:  to North Korea and he took part in celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the Korean war armistice.
07:38.940 - 07:43.180:  And while he was there, he was given a guided tour. Not of the sites of Pyongyang,
07:43.180 - 07:47.480:  but of an exhibition of weaponry and military equipment, including missiles,
07:47.480 - 07:54.440:  the Americans have said that that visit was followed up by another visit by a Russian delegation
07:54.440 - 08:01.220:  to Pyongyang. And last month, we know that President Putin and Kim Jong-un exchanged letters,
08:01.260 - 08:08.020:  according to the North Korean state media, Vladimir Putin himself was admitted in recent months
08:08.460 - 08:13.580:  that Russia has been running low on certain weapons. I mean, back in June, I think he said that
08:13.580 - 08:19.540:  Russia was short of high precision ammunition, communications equipment, aircraft, and drones.
08:20.240 - 08:25.880:  And that's despite the fact that weapons production here in Russia has been increased over
08:25.880 - 08:31.540:  the last year or so. But, you know, the official line from the Kremlin continues to be that despite
08:31.540 - 08:37.520:  any shortages, Russia is still doing better on the battlefield than Ukraine. And only yesterday,
08:37.520 - 08:44.480:  in Sochi, President Putin repeated his claim that Ukraine's counteroffensive hadn't simply
08:44.480 - 08:48.480:  stalled, he said, it had failed. And that is the line repeated in the state media here.
08:48.820 - 08:54.400:  Although one Russian newspaper this morning, Comer Sunt, admitted that for several days now,
08:54.400 - 08:58.980:  Ukraine has been celebrating breaching Russia's first line of defense.
08:58.980 - 09:04.600:  Steve Rosenberg, here Moscow. It's taken more than 10 years for the case to come to court,
09:04.600 - 09:09.700:  and 80,000 documents have been assembled. But today, in the Swedish capital Stockholm,
09:09.700 - 09:15.700:  the trial started of two oil executives accused of complicity in war crimes. In London,
09:15.700 - 09:22.080:  and Swiss national Alex Schneider, were chairman and vice president, respectively, of the family firm
09:22.080 - 09:28.680:  London Oil, back in the 1990s and 2000s. And in that time, so the prosecution says they operated
09:28.680 - 09:34.140:  in Sudan in a way which they knew would lead to major human rights abuses, including murder.
09:34.780 - 09:38.120:  A small group of protesters gathered outside the court building in Stockholm.
09:38.900 - 09:43.940:  We are here today to show our support for the people in South Sudan who have suffered
09:44.760 - 09:51.120:  consequences of the drilling. For me, it is important, as a swede, to take stand.
09:52.160 - 09:55.740:  Well, Paul Moss, our Europe regional editor, told me more.
09:56.720 - 10:01.460:  London Oil was operating in Sudan during a time of great conflict. This conflict now, but this
10:01.460 - 10:06.100:  was different. The southern part of the country had a separatist movement. In fact, it was successful
10:06.100 - 10:12.740:  and is now the independent nation, South Sudan. But back then, there was a bitter war. And one reason
10:12.740 - 10:17.940:  that this conflict was so bitter is that the contested area had lots of oil fields. Now,
10:17.940 - 10:22.500:  London Oil was operating in Sudan at the time, and they were interested in an area known as the
10:22.500 - 10:28.560:  Block 5A field. The problem was this field was out of the government's control. What the
10:28.560 - 10:33.260:  prosecution say is that in London and his vice chair Alex Schneider went to the Sudanese government
10:33.260 - 10:39.560:  and specifically asked them to seize control of the area so they could get the oil out. And no
10:39.560 - 10:44.520:  problem, said the government allegedly. They bombed the area. They sent in ground troops and
10:44.520 - 10:49.140:  militias to burn people out of their homes. And some of the people were shot as they escaped
10:49.140 - 10:54.080:  from helicopters. And the case of the prosecution is that this makes London and Schneider
10:54.080 - 10:59.280:  complicit in war crimes. And if convicted, these two people could get life sentences.
10:59.760 - 11:03.980:  Also, the prosecution wants to find the company. And I think this is important because it gives you
11:03.980 - 11:11.020:  an idea of the kind of money involved. London, they say, made $220 million from its operations in
11:11.020 - 11:16.440:  Sudan. And that money they want to be confiscated. So accusations of grave behavior, the trial
11:16.440 - 11:21.760:  starts today up to this point. What do the two defendants say? Well, Alex Schneider tried to
11:21.760 - 11:26.460:  avoid the trial altogether. Said he was a Swiss citizen. But in fact, that was rejected.
11:27.200 - 11:31.700:  Instead, he and London are insisting there's just not enough evidence to prove the case. They argue
11:31.700 - 11:37.220:  Sudan has conflicts. Anyway, they didn't start it. And in fact, he and London has said that in fact,
11:37.220 - 11:42.660:  his company was a force for good in Sudan. And just quickly, I mean, a massive endeavor of I said,
11:42.660 - 11:46.780:  as I said, is this a one off case, though? Not at all. I mean, what's being alleged here is the
11:46.780 - 11:51.480:  kind of thing that has been alleged in conflicts all around the world. And I think that's why
11:51.480 - 11:56.040:  protesters showed up. It's there's a lot of interest. Now, without commenting on the guilt or
11:56.040 - 12:00.880:  innocence of the two particular defendants here, what we see are plenty of countries where there's
12:00.880 - 12:05.120:  an allegation that companies from the West come in. They want to get their hands on some kind of
12:05.120 - 12:10.240:  natural resource, oil, gas, minerals, perhaps kind of metals you and I use in our mobile phones
12:10.240 - 12:16.220:  and laptops. And they pay a group of armed people to seize control of that area and to maybe
12:16.220 - 12:21.140:  commit human rights abuses so they can get their hands on it. They've really, really struggled ever
12:21.140 - 12:25.520:  to collect net companies with this. And that's why there's so much interest around the world on
12:25.520 - 12:31.400:  what happens at a courthouse in Sweden. Paul Moss reporting. Now, let's go quickly to China where two
12:31.400 - 12:37.520:  people have been arrested after using machinery to dig a hole through the Great Wall. Officials say
12:37.520 - 12:42.840:  they did it for a simple reason to create a shortcut. From Beijing, here's our China Correspondence
12:42.840 - 12:48.020:  Devamut Donald. The machine is tracks with a giveaway. Police saw a large section of the Great
12:48.020 - 12:53.460:  Wall of China had been destroyed and simply followed the trail. According to state media,
12:53.460 - 13:00.080:  a man and a woman were questioned and admitted they'd used an excavator to smash through China's
13:00.080 - 13:06.120:  most famous historical structure. They reportedly said they did it to create a shortcut to reduce
13:06.120 - 13:11.880:  travel time for them in the future. Officials said the pair had caused irreversible damage to a
13:11.920 - 13:17.120:  section of the wall, which are being constructed in the Ming dynasty between the 14th and 17th
13:17.120 - 13:21.500:  centuries. Stephen MacDonald reporting, and if you want to see for yourself what that hole looks
13:21.500 - 13:27.220:  like and it really is quite something you can go to BBC News online. In France, a ban on girls
13:27.220 - 13:32.240:  going to school wearing their traditional obeyed dress was tested as it came into force.
13:32.920 - 13:37.860:  Dozens of girls were sent home for refusing to change out of them. The government there introduced
13:37.860 - 13:42.980:  the rule last week arguing that the long robes which are worn by some Muslims are contrary to
13:42.980 - 13:47.520:  France's secular rules. Our Paris correspondent, Hugh Scofield, has the details.
13:48.660 - 13:57.420:  The victory that 298 teenagers turned up wearing anabaya and in most cases they were offered
13:57.840 - 14:04.400:  dialogue with the staff and eventually complied and changed into what was allowed. But in 67
14:04.400 - 14:09.800:  cases the girls refused and they were sent home and there will be another period of dialogue now
14:09.800 - 14:14.660:  and the hope is that at the end of that they will come in. Today is another test day because
14:15.100 - 14:19.380:  in fact yesterday not everyone went back to school. The last two years of Lisa in other words,
14:20.260 - 14:24.540:  1718 year olds going back today is quite possible that there will be another tranche
14:24.920 - 14:30.560:  of tests today when they go back. Globally then there is resistance but it's not huge
14:30.920 - 14:36.560:  and the government is clearly taking some comfort from the fact that overall we were talking about
14:36.560 - 14:41.840:  several million people who went back to school yesterday and the number of cases is as I say
14:41.840 - 14:47.680:  200-300 and of them most people ended up complying. So a small number but I mean France has very
14:47.680 - 14:53.680:  strict secular laws, doesn't it? Separating church or mosque and state. A Muslim group is going
14:53.680 - 14:57.960:  to go to court later today I think to challenge this ruling. Do you think there's any prospect of
14:57.960 - 15:02.720:  forcing a change to the law? Personally I think it's most unlikely but you know it is a legal
15:02.720 - 15:08.140:  process and this group has marshaled the arguments saying for example that it's very difficult to
15:08.140 - 15:14.500:  define what an abaya is, what kind of a loose garment is it and also saying what this unfairly
15:14.500 - 15:21.500:  targets a certain portion of the school body and those on Muslims and that that is unfair. These
15:21.500 - 15:26.040:  are serious arguments and they'll be taken into account by the conceded author which is the
15:26.040 - 15:29.860:  highest administrative court which will rule in the next 48 hours. Personally I don't think it's
15:29.860 - 15:34.440:  likely to succeed because you know all the comment you're getting here is that this does fall
15:34.440 - 15:41.220:  under the 2004 law which banned conspicuous signs of religious affiliation and that most
15:41.220 - 15:47.560:  people that I've seen quoted seem to be saying that this does form a conspicuous sign of Muslim
15:47.560 - 15:51.760:  affiliation. But just briefly do you expect that even though there's a large number of people
15:51.760 - 15:55.940:  complying there is a small number of resistors who intend to continue in that? If the headscarf
15:56.000 - 15:59.940:  debates anything to go by there will be resistance for a while but it will peter out and this will
15:59.940 - 16:05.420:  end up being just part of the mores of French society but I think that will in for a bit of a
16:05.420 - 16:10.880:  tense period of the next few weeks. Hesco filled in Paris. Now here in London all this week musicians
16:10.880 - 16:16.760:  and singers are being honored with stones on the music walk of fame in the city's Camden district
16:16.780 - 16:22.700:  an area renowned for its vibrant art scene David Bowie the Who Madness and Amy Winehouse
16:23.080 - 16:28.160:  already have stones but now a few more national and international stars are joining this elite
16:28.160 - 16:41.160:  bunch as Wendy Irkut reports. She's one of the most iconic singers ever and her music is revered
16:41.160 - 16:47.160:  by top stars all over the world. Now Janice Joplin is being honored with a stone on the
16:47.160 - 16:52.140:  music walk of fame in London. Her sister Laura and brother Michael were at the unveiling
16:52.480 - 16:57.440:  and Michael says he knows exactly how she would feel. She would just be cackling and laughing and
16:57.440 - 17:03.000:  proud as hell. Laura said her sister's lasting influence was inspiring women to be themselves.
17:03.600 - 17:09.820:  Janice Joplin was born in Port Arthur, Texas in 1943 and showed her talent as a singer at a young
17:09.820 - 17:16.020:  age. She sang with several bands throughout high school but at the age of 20 she left home and
17:16.020 - 17:21.060:  hitchhiked her way to San Francisco. Her performance with Big Brother and the holding company at the
17:21.060 - 17:27.820:  Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 brought her national attention and after a couple of albums she left the
17:27.820 - 17:37.900:  band and launched her solo career. Oh Lord don't you buy me a Mercedes Benz my friends all drive
17:37.900 - 17:46.240:  horses I must make amends would stock in 1969 and the festival express train to her followed
17:46.240 - 17:53.360:  and by now five of her singles were in the US Billboard Hot 100 including her original song
17:53.360 - 18:00.040:  Mercedes Benz. Janice Joplin was a heavy drinker a speed freak for her use of methamphetamines
18:00.080 - 18:06.480:  and later became addicted to heroin. On October 4th 1970 she was found dead in a hotel room in
18:06.480 - 18:11.300:  Hollywood with a bunch of change in one hand and a pack of cigarettes in the other she was only
18:11.300 - 18:18.040:  27. Her solo album Pearl was released in 1971 just a few months after she died.
18:23.860 - 18:29.600:  The British reggae band UB40 were also given a stone on the music walk of fame and former
18:29.600 - 18:35.480:  lead singer Ali Campbell is absolutely over the moon. We're pretty honored by this and what's good
18:35.480 - 18:40.680:  is we've come full circle you know when we started our adventure out of Birmingham in Interlundan
18:41.280 - 18:50.160:  first place we came to was Camden. I love you I love you Janice Joplin UB40 the
18:50.160 - 18:55.160:  Kinks and the Buzzcox will join a host of big names on the music walk of fame before the
18:55.160 - 19:01.540:  Camden Music Festival kicks off in London on Saturday. It promises to be a music extravaganza
19:01.540 - 19:07.280:  with life performances by the Buzzcox Jazzy B from Salted Soul, Shalimar and many more.
19:07.460 - 19:10.300:  It's on from noon until 8pm and it's free.
19:21.280 - 19:25.960:  Wendy Eurka reporting. Still to come in this podcast.
19:32.300 - 19:38.980:  Um it's not terrible. More music. Well as Ali Bongo is removed as the leader of Gabon we look
19:39.000 - 19:41.840:  back at another career of his that also ended badly.
19:48.640 - 19:52.600:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
19:52.760 - 19:58.520:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
19:58.520 - 20:02.960:  made their money and then we decide if they are actually Good Bad or just plain wealthy.
20:03.080 - 20:07.880:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims or what Jeff Bezos
20:07.880 - 20:12.220:  really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars.
20:12.380 - 20:17.640:  Listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me Simon Jack and me Zingsing available now wherever you
20:17.640 - 20:18.320:  get your podcasts.
20:22.980 - 20:27.700:  For more than five decades Colombia has dealt with conflict between the government and leftist
20:27.700 - 20:31.820:  guerrillas, right wing paramilitaries and drug and criminal cartels.
20:32.320 - 20:37.160:  Now at least nine people have died in fighting between two rebel groups in the border area with
20:37.160 - 20:42.400:  Venezuela. The area is a hub for cocaine trafficking and illegal mining and violent
20:42.400 - 20:48.120:  confrontations there are common. This time they were between the ELN, Colombia's last active
20:48.120 - 20:53.820:  guerrilla group and a dissident faction of the FARC which refused to acknowledge a 2016 peace
20:54.060 - 20:59.480:  deal. We heard from our America's editor Leonardo Rosha. We have classes like that happening
20:59.480 - 21:05.680:  very frequently every now and again but there seems to be bigger income also at the wrong time.
21:05.680 - 21:11.380:  Let's put it that way because both of those groups are negotiating peace with the government.
21:11.960 - 21:18.420:  What happened was a clash in a jungle area rural area in the province of Aralca near the border
21:19.160 - 21:24.680:  Venezuela and you have on one side the ELN, the National Liberation Army which is the main
21:24.680 - 21:32.200:  the only big active rebel group in Colombia and on the other side a dissident group from the FARC
21:32.200 - 21:39.560:  rebel group. The FARC in 2016 signed a peace deal with the government but there is a significant
21:39.560 - 21:45.860:  number more than 3,000 fighters who refuse to accept those terms and continue to fight. I mean
21:45.860 - 21:52.920:  they're involved in drug trafficking and extortion and illegal gold mining including in indigenous
21:52.920 - 21:57.860:  areas. It strikes me we've had decades of violence we've had years of negotiations we have a
21:57.860 - 22:03.420:  president who himself is a former guerrilla fighter and yet we still have incidents like this.
22:04.040 - 22:11.480:  Why do we have so much talk but not enough action? It's very difficult for one thing many of
22:11.480 - 22:18.260:  these people they were born into this life. Others have some involvement in that for example they
22:18.260 - 22:24.300:  are indigenous people or when you say indigenous they are people who farm or live locally who
22:25.020 - 22:31.300:  have either their force to work with some rebel groups even for protection or they provide food
22:31.300 - 22:37.140:  or their force to work with them. Others are fighters who if they were in a big city they would be
22:37.140 - 22:43.400:  probably in a gang they wouldn't have much choice or they choose that sort of life. What we have
22:43.400 - 22:48.180:  here is the government trying to engage with the leaders. That's all well and good giving the leaders
22:48.740 - 22:53.340:  hope and choice and alternatives but at the end of the day there are people at the bottom
22:53.340 - 22:59.340:  of that criminal food chain. How do you help those people? Well it's interesting you say that because
23:00.660 - 23:07.200:  just when those attacks were happening the news were breaking. The fourth round of talks between
23:07.200 - 23:12.620:  the yellow and this main rebel group and the government had come to an end and both sides went
23:12.620 - 23:17.620:  and had a statement and say everything was going fine and well and they were talking exactly
23:17.620 - 23:22.620:  about that. Some of the people the people who live indigenous people, rural people were being
23:22.620 - 23:28.360:  affected really badly affected by this infighting and by violence or poverty in some areas
23:28.780 - 23:33.240:  and they announced just as they're all that violence was happening they announced some measures
23:33.240 - 23:39.540:  which were not specified but basically delivering food or delivering aid or trying to
23:39.540 - 23:45.420:  protect safeguard some communities who were really under threat. Leonardo Rocher now let's come back
23:45.420 - 23:50.700:  to Europe where it's nearly three months since a fishing boat carrying as many as 750 men,
23:50.700 - 23:57.900:  women and children sank off the coast of Greece causing an international outcry only 104 of the
23:57.900 - 24:02.480:  people on board were pulled to safety making it the worst loss of life in the Mediterranean
24:02.480 - 24:07.860:  sea for nearly a decade. There remain many unanswered questions notably about the actions of the
24:07.860 - 24:12.780:  Greek Coast Guard in dealing with the migrant boats. Our Europe correspondent Nick Beek has
24:12.780 - 24:18.100:  traveled back to Greece for a World Service documentary his report begins with the story of one of
24:18.100 - 24:27.720:  the survivors. There were 180 of us kept in the warehouse it was so bad we were humiliated
24:28.620 - 24:35.240:  sworn at and beaten. We weren't able to go out we were surfed one meal per day just
24:35.240 - 24:40.080:  some bread with a triangle of cheese. This is the miserable experience in Libya that confronted
24:40.080 - 24:48.260:  ATF after he'd paid a smuggler $4,400. He's now in the system but still far from European soil.
24:48.780 - 24:53.540:  There's no internet in the warehouse and only occasionally there's a flicker of phone coverage
24:53.540 - 24:58.160:  to send a text message home. Once you are in the warehouse you cannot leave.
24:59.460 - 25:05.700:  Only if your smuggler gives the order you are able to leave. A vast warehouse of customers
25:06.280 - 25:10.860:  all at the mercy of their specific smuggler a corrupted version of a travel operator
25:11.340 - 25:14.340:  who is now looking for a boat waiting for the right weather,
25:14.340 - 25:20.800:  bribing the right port officials. It can take months. There was one group of Egyptians who had
25:20.800 - 25:26.240:  been in the warehouse for a whole year. They belonged to a smuggler named Kadura. Most likely
25:26.240 - 25:32.740:  Kadura had already spent the money they gave him. He kept ignoring them, poor people. They have
25:32.740 - 25:38.800:  been imprisoned for more than one year. They looked severely weak. When our group left they were
25:38.800 - 25:44.280:  still being kept there. ATF realises the whole business is not a secret operation in the shadows
25:44.280 - 25:50.580:  but a highly lucrative operation for the military men in power. My smuggler is an officer
25:50.580 - 25:55.540:  in the Libyan Navy. He's a government official but he's managing human trafficking operations.
25:56.300 - 26:01.100:  They play both sides. They keep receiving funds from Italy to manage the migration crisis
26:01.100 - 26:07.220:  and at the same time there are the ones behind smuggling people to Europe. There are many smuggling
26:07.220 - 26:13.300:  trips that live Libya in broad daylight from commercial ports. Smuggling is run by the state.
26:13.520 - 26:19.120:  The Libyan Navy denies these claims and says it is helping the EU to stop crossings to Europe.
26:19.880 - 26:26.260:  Finally on the 9th of June ATF smuggler comes to the warehouse to collect him and the 35 others
26:26.260 - 26:29.180:  in his particular group. They don't know where they're going.
26:31.260 - 26:35.380:  We arrived in a deserted place and were taken to an abandoned house.
26:36.620 - 26:43.060:  There we found other groups of people. Only then did we realise we were about to get on a boat.
26:43.580 - 26:50.080:  It was night time. We were asked to turn off our phones. We didn't even have a chance to tell
26:50.080 - 26:56.080:  our families we were leaving. They're put in small boats and taken out to a rusting fishing
26:56.080 - 27:02.360:  trawler on the cusp of international waters. ATF describes the first 24 hours at sea.
27:02.800 - 27:07.480:  People were piled on top of each other. You had to fight for a spot.
27:08.700 - 27:12.260:  Many people were seasick and vomiting. It was disgusting.
27:14.140 - 27:17.820:  We were exposed to the burning sun in the day and the freezing cold at night.
27:18.560 - 27:23.440:  Still we were quite optimistic. The captain told us we would reach Italy in three days.
27:24.820 - 27:29.960:  On the second day, the engine starts to fail. Passengers begin to ask questions of the crew
27:30.240 - 27:34.840:  and the captain, who's only 22. It wasn't supposed to be like this.
27:36.520 - 27:41.680:  We were going in zigzags. The captain said he was taking different
27:41.680 - 27:47.400:  truths to evade the Libyan coast guard. We realised later that for all those days,
27:48.480 - 27:49.440:  we were lost at sea.
27:53.100 - 27:59.340:  Nick Beek reporting from Greece. The leader of a crew that ousted Gabbons president Ali Bongo
27:59.340 - 28:04.760:  was sworn in as interim president on Monday. General Bryce Oligui and Guema and other
28:04.760 - 28:09.480:  members of Gabbons presidential guard took power in a coup on August 30th,
28:09.940 - 28:14.400:  ousting longtime president Ali Bongo just hours after he was declared the winner
28:14.680 - 28:18.940:  of presidential elections, which the army subsequently said were fraudulent.
28:19.680 - 28:23.440:  Cool leaders have come under international pressure to restore civilian government,
28:23.440 - 28:26.540:  but said on Friday that they would not rush to hold elections.
28:27.320 - 28:32.400:  Our reporter in Gabbons spoke with residents in the capital Libraville for their comments on the
28:32.400 - 28:37.880:  new leader. I'm very happy to read the new government because the people of Gabbons,
28:38.040 - 28:45.300:  everybody is happy. Today is good day. Today is good day. Gabbons is liberty.
28:47.100 - 28:55.900:  Freedom is today. Gabbons is liberty. Okay. For us it is an answer prayer. It is not all about
28:55.900 - 29:02.600:  military men. All we have been praying is for changes. We said it's going to conduct elections
29:03.340 - 29:09.860:  and we hope by God's grace. If he has the fear of God he will conduct a neat election.
29:10.640 - 29:16.920:  And our prayer is to have leaders that have fear of God. That is our prayer.
29:17.820 - 29:24.020:  We believe in new president. We believe in Oligui because Oligui is different because
29:24.020 - 29:33.940:  Oligui is nationalist. Oligui is if Gabbon is recognized that the last government does
29:33.940 - 29:44.160:  a very bad thing. Do you remember in 2016 the last government killed Gabbonist people?
29:45.100 - 29:49.020:  Well let's stay in Gabbon and look back at the deposed leader Ali Bongo who has said to have
29:49.020 - 29:55.880:  been drawn to music much more than politics before succeeding his father Omar Bongo in 2009.
29:56.820 - 30:01.840:  The family dynasty was famous for amassing a wealth of luxury mansions abroad as well as luxury
30:01.840 - 30:07.820:  cars but they also spent big on music and their association with western artists in particular.
30:08.640 - 30:15.640:  Before he became Ali Bongo his name was Alam Bongo and in 1977 he released a funk record called
30:15.640 - 30:20.840:  a brand new man produced by James Brown's friend and manager Charles Bobbitt.
30:21.720 - 30:27.120:  Well the author RJ Smith wrote a book about James Brown and he's been telling us a bit more about that time.
30:36.260 - 30:43.940:  It's kind of a half disco half funk album it's kind of a love boat disco 70 soundtrack kind of
30:43.940 - 30:47.580:  slug and Bongo's accrues over the top of it.
30:53.680 - 31:03.680:  So Ali Bongo is a brand new man. It's not terrible. There's great musicianship that he hired
31:03.680 - 31:09.720:  that came from Charles Bobbitt and James Brown's band so it sounds good sometimes except for
31:09.720 - 31:15.120:  the voice on the top which kind of wobbles in and out of the beat. So Ali Bongo wanted to be a
31:15.120 - 31:21.300:  disco star. He wanted to be the James Brown, Barry White, the Teddy Pendergrass of the world
31:22.580 - 31:24.620:  and he did not achieve those goals. No.
31:39.740 - 31:43.740:  RJ Smith is on the music of Ali or is it Alam Bongo.
31:45.120 - 31:49.820:  Now a change of pace as the war in Ukraine shows no signs of ending the emotional toll on its
31:49.820 - 31:55.200:  population is huge which is why Elena Zalenska the wife of the president there will on
31:55.200 - 32:00.600:  Wednesday host a summit of first ladies and gentlemen which she says will focus on mental health.
32:01.180 - 32:05.600:  The BBC's Yada Hakeem spoke with her and asked her first how she was coping.
32:06.380 - 32:14.440:  It's a difficult question. I'm holding on really for a year and a half now we cannot be sure
32:14.440 - 32:21.060:  about tomorrow we don't have confidence in our future in a month or two. We have a huge hope
32:21.080 - 32:29.240:  for victory but we don't know when it comes and this long wait constant stress it has its toll
32:29.940 - 32:37.020:  so everyone finds their own way here or stimuli to deal with it. For me such stimuli are work
32:37.740 - 32:43.560:  including our interview because when you have the reason to wake up and go to work it doesn't give
32:43.560 - 32:50.500:  you a chance to stop and think why this is happening to us and I'm very much supported by
32:50.500 - 32:56.360:  inspiring stories of Ukrainians every day because in every tragedy there is a story of saving
32:56.360 - 33:04.840:  help heroism and it inspires me a lot I'm holding on to you to that and so I think most of my
33:04.840 - 33:13.820:  colleagues and friends. How do you deal with other strains on your family? For example your husband
33:13.820 - 33:22.740:  being compared to Winston Churchill how do you respond to that? Well it depends on the way
33:22.740 - 33:29.120:  you'd like to look at Winston Churchill of course he's a historical figure I did not dream about
33:29.120 - 33:35.960:  my husband becoming a historic person maybe it's selfish but I need a husband not a historical
33:35.960 - 33:42.720:  figure beside me but on the other hand if it's about a leader who led his country through the
33:42.720 - 33:48.960:  difficulties of war if that kind of comparison would be accurate I'd love it he really does have
33:48.960 - 33:56.740:  the energy the willpower inspiration and stubbornness to go through this war so we finally see our
33:56.740 - 34:04.060:  long awaited victory I believe in him and I support him I know that he has enough strength
34:04.060 - 34:11.640:  for any other person I know I think it would be much harder to handle this situation he really is
34:11.640 - 34:18.660:  a very strong and resilient person and this resilience is what we all need right now
34:20.860 - 34:25.700:  that was Ukraine's first lady speaking to my colleague Yelda Hakim let's send this podcast on
34:25.700 - 34:31.220:  opposites and love you've probably heard the phrase opposites attract turns out though that
34:31.220 - 34:37.040:  new research suggests you may actually be drawn to someone more like you the newsrooms Jacob Evans
34:37.040 - 34:43.400:  explains maybe it's the good girl I'm the bad boy you're a fake and a phony and I wish I'd
34:43.400 - 34:49.940:  never lay eyes on you or differences in social standing I just understand I love you
34:51.880 - 35:02.380:  most ugly or maybe even a princess and an ogre you're an ogre oh you're expecting prince charming
35:02.880 - 35:08.300:  well the old adage that when looking for love opposites attract may not be so true a new study
35:08.300 - 35:15.180:  has analysed 133 traits in almost 80,000 heterosexual couples and found in the majority of cases
35:15.180 - 35:21.040:  there were massive similarities the research also looked at around 200 previous studies analyzing
35:21.040 - 35:26.960:  things like religious and political views educational attainment and IQ through to drug habits
35:26.960 - 35:31.920:  number of sexual partners your height weight and whether or not you're a night owl it was
35:31.920 - 35:37.480:  conducted by the University of Colorado and Boulder and found that between 82 and 89% of
35:37.480 - 35:42.640:  traits examined were similar among partners with just 3% of traits among couples being classified
35:42.640 - 35:47.500:  as substantially different some scientists say the results could be an insight into worrying future
35:47.500 - 35:53.120:  trends if tall people keep pairing with tall people or short people with short people then future
35:53.120 - 35:58.960:  generations may be at genetic extremes others fears socioeconomic divides could also widen if
35:58.960 - 36:06.100:  people partner with those of similar backgrounds Jacob Evans reporting and that's all from us
36:06.100 - 36:10.680:  for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later if you want to comment
