00:21.140 - 00:23.560:  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
00:23.900 - 00:28.020:  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
00:28.020 - 00:31.280:  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

01:08.700 - 01:09.740:  It doesn't get much...

01:19.120 - 01:21.580:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:24.120 - 01:27.120:  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Friday, the 15th of September,
01:27.360 - 01:28.340:  these are our main stories.
01:28.840 - 01:34.180:  President Biden's son, Hunter, has been criminally charged with lying when buying a firearm.
01:34.880 - 01:40.880:  The Libyan Red Cross says at least 11,000 people died in the floods that hit the city of Dürner.
01:41.340 - 01:45.200:  And they take one word from you and create a story.
01:45.720 - 01:49.480:  And you want to pay more, but in most cases, they are just lying.
01:50.000 - 01:54.420:  The Syrian refugees looking for missing loved ones and being scammed.
01:54.680 - 02:00.960:  Also in this podcast, a man in Brazil is the first to be convicted
02:00.960 - 02:05.780:  of attempting a coup in January when key government buildings were ransacked.
02:06.020 - 02:09.980:  And quite common for golfers to be just walking along.
02:10.300 - 02:13.320:  Mining their own business, playing their golf, and then seeing a shark fin
02:13.320 - 02:15.740:  sort of cruising only a few metres away from them.
02:16.100 - 02:21.100:  The bull sharks that adapted swimmingly to life on an Australian golf course.
02:24.440 - 02:27.820:  The U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, has been
02:27.820 - 02:30.000:  indicted on federal gun charges.
02:30.000 - 02:34.440:  It is the first ever prosecution of a child of a sitting U.S. President.
02:34.440 - 02:38.780:  Our correspondent in Washington, Sean Dilly, told me more about the charges.
02:39.220 - 02:45.680:  They relate to Hunter Biden buying a gun back in 2018 on the 18th of October.
02:45.680 - 02:49.680:  He filled out a form that anybody has to fill out from the Bureau of Alcohol,
02:49.860 - 02:56.080:  Firearms, and on that form he confirmed that he wasn't a user of narcotics or drugs.
02:56.080 - 02:59.940:  Now the prosecution is alleging that he was knowingly not telling the truth then.
02:59.940 - 03:04.620:  So there were two charges in relation to the purchase and then another one that relates to him
03:05.220 - 03:08.820:  receiving that gun around a week later on the 23rd of October that year.
03:09.140 - 03:12.200:  Now what are Mr. Biden's lawyers saying in response to these charges?
03:12.600 - 03:16.180:  Hunter Biden's lawyers in response to this are saying, well hang on a minute,
03:16.180 - 03:19.260:  the facts of this case haven't changed in the past five years.
03:19.460 - 03:24.660:  They're suggesting that it's a political activity from people who support what they say
03:24.660 - 03:29.620:  MAGA make America greater. Again, they're suggesting political pressure from Donald Trump supporters.
03:30.120 - 03:34.560:  Just worth noting when his lawyers refer to the facts have been the same for the past five years.
03:34.740 - 03:38.220:  They had had negotiations with prosecutors in Delaware already.
03:38.800 - 03:43.900:  It had apparently been agreed between them that if he pleaded guilty to two tax cheating charges
03:43.900 - 03:49.460:  from 2017 and 18 that he would escape an eventual felony conviction for having the gun.
03:49.460 - 03:54.580:  They would use something called a diversion program that if he abided by certain restrictions
03:54.640 - 03:59.000:  that charge would be dismissed entirely. And so they're suggesting there wasn't anything wrong
03:59.000 - 04:03.880:  with that deal, but unfortunately the judge in the unrelated tax evasion charge at the end of July
04:03.880 - 04:08.040:  was she had issues with that arrangement. This is obviously the build up to the
04:08.360 - 04:14.860:  November 2024 presidential election. To what extent do you think the Republicans will be able
04:14.860 - 04:20.820:  to use this to tarnish the Biden brand in general? There are Hunter Biden supporters who believe
04:20.820 - 04:25.900:  it's a conspiracy by Donald Trump supporters to use the criminal justice system and those are
04:25.900 - 04:29.660:  the exact same charges that the opposition obviously put forward. But the reality is,
04:29.660 - 04:35.840:  is an unrelated case. Doesn't he involve Hunter Biden's dad Joe Biden? This is exclusively to do
04:35.840 - 04:40.120:  with possession of a firearm by Hunter Biden, but that won't stop Donald Trump supporters in
04:40.120 - 04:45.440:  particular using it for political capital. Sean Dilly in Washington. The World Health
04:45.440 - 04:50.920:  Organization is warning that survivors of flooding in Libya remain in danger from contaminated
04:50.920 - 04:56.840:  flood water and a lack of medical supplies. The organization has announced it is sending trauma,
04:56.840 - 05:02.200:  surgical and emergency equipment to the country. There are growing calls from inside Libya
05:02.200 - 05:08.900:  for an inquiry into the disaster. Najwa Wahiba is a spokesperson for Libya's presidential council.
05:09.420 - 05:13.760:  It's rarely to happen such a strong storm in the Mediterranean, but at the same time,
05:13.760 - 05:19.420:  the huge number of victims reflects that there might be a human mistake, there might be negligence.
05:19.420 - 05:24.720:  Also, there were complaints from the towns of the Green Mountain and Durna that there might be
05:24.720 - 05:31.440:  delay in delivery of aid. So that's why we ask officially the Attorney General to lodge investigation
05:31.440 - 05:37.220:  and those who are responsible must hold accountable. Well, the Libyan Red Crescent says the number of
05:37.220 - 05:43.280:  people who've died in the city of Durna has now risen to 11,000 and that figure is expected to
05:43.280 - 05:49.060:  grow as the recovery effort continues and more bodies are retrieved from the mud. Sebastian Asha
05:49.060 - 05:54.500:  has the latest. Rescue teams from across the region are now searching the mud and ruins of Durna
05:54.500 - 05:59.620:  despite problems with docking in the port and reaching the city by road. Local officials have
05:59.620 - 06:04.660:  called for specialist teams and more body bags to tackle the horrifying number of the dead in a
06:04.660 - 06:09.100:  race against time to prevent an outbreak of disease. The political divisions would have played
06:09.100 - 06:14.040:  Libya for years are likely to complicate the process. Many Libyans have blamed politicians
06:14.040 - 06:19.020:  whether in the UN backed administration in Tripoli or the breakaway authority in Benghazi
06:19.020 - 06:24.500:  for failing to maintain infrastructure, especially the two dams that burst just outside Durna.
06:24.820 - 06:29.200:  The head of the World Meteorological Organisation has said many casualties could have been
06:29.200 - 06:34.980:  avoided if they'd even just been a properly working weather service. Sebastian Asha. Well,
06:34.980 - 06:41.800:  our correspondent Anna Foster has just arrived in Benghazi that about 150 kilometres to the west of
06:41.800 - 06:49.040:  Durna and spoke to us just before we recorded this podcast. I think one thing that's really striking
06:49.040 - 06:54.120:  is that in the days after a catastrophe on the scale of this one you'd normally expect to see
06:54.120 - 06:59.900:  huge amounts of aid really pouring in. I remember seeing it very quickly after the earthquake in Turkey
06:59.900 - 07:04.520:  and Syria just over six months ago. But the airport in Benghazi here today,
07:04.520 - 07:10.020:  while there has been some activity, some international teams arriving, it is really not the
07:10.320 - 07:14.960:  hive that you would expect and that this country needs. There are many injuries, there are many,
07:14.960 - 07:19.640:  many thousands more who are displaced and this country with its infrastructure that is so
07:19.640 - 07:24.940:  ravaged by more than a decade now of conflict, a country which doesn't have a single
07:24.940 - 07:30.960:  functioning government which has warring factions in east and west is in no position to try and
07:30.960 - 07:39.580:  deal really with the scale of the disaster that now faces it. Anna Foster. On January 1st, 2023,
07:39.620 - 07:44.980:  Luis Inacio Lula de Silva was inaugurated as the 39th president of Brazil.
07:45.860 - 07:49.840:  Seven days later, this was the scene at the presidential palace in Brasilia.
07:54.160 - 07:59.760:  Thousands of supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the former president and losing candidate
08:00.240 - 08:04.800:  in last year's election, broke through police lines and stormed the presidential palace
08:05.140 - 08:11.560:  and other key government buildings ransacking them as they went. Now, the first person to be
08:11.560 - 08:16.240:  convicted in connection with the rights in Brasilia has been jailed for 17 years.
08:16.700 - 08:19.760:  Our correspondent Katie Watson is in São Paulo and told me more.
08:20.540 - 08:26.260:  So, the first one to be convicted is Isia Lucio Costa Pereira, he's 51. He was filmed in the
08:26.260 - 08:32.660:  Senate on January 8th with a t-shirt calling for military and military coup. He also recorded a
08:32.660 - 08:39.060:  video praising people who had broken into the Senate. So, he is the first of a batch of four
08:39.060 - 08:44.700:  people actually first off to be tried and he's been sentenced for 17 years, you've said,
08:45.160 - 08:51.560:  for criminal association, staging a coup, violent attack on the rule of law, qualified damage,
08:51.560 - 08:57.820:  destruction of public assets, because I think every single Brazilian for many years to come will
08:57.820 - 09:05.100:  remember the ransacked offices, the damaged artwork and the total chaos that we saw take place
09:05.100 - 09:09.800:  on January 8th. Coming back to the present day, this is the first conviction and sentencing,
09:09.800 - 09:15.420:  sending a very strong message 17 years. There are many more cases to follow.
09:15.740 - 09:19.160:  That's right. So, three more people are currently in the dock. This is kind of the first batch,
09:19.160 - 09:24.740:  if you like, the Supreme Court is looking at. But there's more than a thousand people who've
09:24.740 - 09:30.340:  been accused of crimes in connection with the riots and expected that those people will be tried
09:30.420 - 09:35.120:  before the end of the year. I mean, it's worth pointing out that Ayeso Lucio Costa Pereira, he denied
09:35.120 - 09:39.640:  Rondo and he said that he believed the protest would be peaceful, but it was a claim that was
09:39.640 - 09:44.080:  absolutely rejected by the court. In fact, one judge argued it was impossible for someone with a
09:44.080 - 09:49.360:  healthy conscience to believe that after openly inciting a coup, they were there just for a trip
09:49.360 - 09:54.420:  to the park, because he said pretty, pretty kind of cynically. But I mean, that's something, I think
09:54.420 - 09:57.360:  that's what a lot of people will be arguing that they didn't mean to do this, this was not, this
09:57.360 - 10:02.720:  was all meant to be peaceful, but there's a lot of evidence showing that the kind of the buildup
10:02.720 - 10:09.680:  to January the 8th and this inciting a coup in trying to justify that the elections were unfair
10:09.680 - 10:12.900:  and they were rigged and this is what we're probably going to see play out in the coming months.
10:13.420 - 10:20.380:  Katie Watson. It was described as simply an equipment failure, but the consequences were a total
10:20.380 - 10:27.060:  collapse of electricity generation in Nigeria with widespread blackouts. It's not the first
10:27.060 - 10:32.360:  big problem with electricity supplies in a country that's a major exporter of oil and gas.
10:32.360 - 10:40.000:  Last year, the grid collapsed four times. I asked our reporter and Ketchy Ogbonna in Lagos what had
10:40.000 - 10:47.120:  happened and how widespread it had been. As far as we know, the national grid collapsed at about
10:47.120 - 10:53.620:  5 a.m. We do not know what the cause of that national collapse was, but a lot of distribution
10:53.620 - 11:00.600:  companies had sent out messages to consumers stating that there was power outage and they would
11:00.600 - 11:08.660:  restore power once the national grid was rectified. And how long did that take? It took a couple
11:08.660 - 11:15.280:  of hours in some parts modern midday and in some parts power has just been restored this afternoon,
11:15.280 - 11:21.400:  so it's like a gradual restoration from the country. Now this was quite an extreme event even for
11:21.400 - 11:27.840:  Nigeria, but on a regular basis there were random power cuts in various parts of the country
11:28.380 - 11:35.200:  on a daily basis, aren't there? Exactly. Now sometimes they could run for 12 hours or more,
11:35.220 - 11:42.140:  depending on the supply. Sometimes it's ascribed to the low water in the dams that are generating
11:42.140 - 11:48.620:  from the hydroelectricity plants. Other times is that the gas turbines as well have probably
11:48.660 - 11:55.780:  lost supply and so transmission could also be an issue. And Ketchy, how do people adapt to
11:55.780 - 12:01.420:  dealing with these power outages that are so unpredictable, how do small businesses cope,
12:01.440 - 12:05.820:  how do people cope with their everyday lives? Well, a lot of small businesses in the country rely
12:05.820 - 12:12.240:  on fuel and diesel generators and manufacturing for production. Alternative sources of energy
12:12.240 - 12:18.920:  would have been ideal in terms of solar, but those are very expensive and are not affordable
12:18.920 - 12:25.080:  to small business owners and home owners as well. That was in Ketchy Ogbonna in Lagos.
12:26.260 - 12:31.000:  Now thousands of Syrians have been detained or have gone missing since the start of the uprising
12:31.000 - 12:37.640:  in Syria in 2011 and the war that followed. Their families have no idea where they are or whether
12:37.640 - 12:42.700:  they're dead or alive. In desperation they are paying thousands of dollars for information,
12:42.700 - 12:49.880:  which almost always turns out to be false. Lena Sinja reports from Turkey where she meets Syrian
12:49.880 - 12:59.080:  refugees searching for news of their missing relatives. I'm visiting a woman named Malak,
12:59.500 - 13:05.480:  a Syrian mother of three sons. Two of them are missing in Syria. Her tiny apartment is in the
13:05.480 - 13:11.020:  suburbs of Istanbul. She scrolls through her phone showing me photos of the two brothers who she
13:11.020 - 13:17.180:  hasn't seen since they were arrested by the Syrian authorities 11 years ago. This is her elder son
13:17.180 - 13:23.560:  before he was arrested. I'm like a swari omelette. He's just a young man with brown hair and
13:23.560 - 13:32.300:  little mustache. This is the younger son, Mahed, just before his arrest. He's too young to face
13:32.300 - 13:39.300:  all of this. The United Nations estimates that a hundred thousand Syrians have been imprisoned
13:39.300 - 13:45.280:  and have disappeared since the beginning of Syria's uprising in 2011. It became a civil war
13:45.560 - 13:51.100:  as President Assad's brutal regime cracked down on unarmed protesters, killing and arresting
13:51.100 - 13:57.920:  thousands of them. Malak's older son was detained after deserting the army in 2012 and she's
13:57.920 - 14:04.760:  heard nothing since. Malak and her youngest son left Syria in 2017 to start a new life in Turkey,
14:04.760 - 14:11.600:  home now to more than three million Syrian refugees. She, like many, has paid middlemen to try
14:11.600 - 14:17.760:  to find out about her missing sons. They take one word from you and create a story,
14:18.340 - 14:23.280:  so they make you more interested and you want to pay more so that you get information.
14:23.280 - 14:28.360:  But in most cases, they are just lying and extracting your money for nothing.
14:28.360 - 14:33.120:  There is an assumption that paying bribes is the only way to get anything done in Syria.
14:33.500 - 14:37.520:  My name is Riyadh Ablar, co-founder in the Association of detainees,
14:37.520 - 14:43.400:  emissing in Sayed Naya prison. Sayed Naya prison is one of the most notorious in Syria,
14:43.820 - 14:49.160:  and Riyadh, who's actually Turkish, was detained there for criticizing the government while a student.
14:49.160 - 14:54.440:  His family heard nothing about him for 15 years. When he was eventually released,
14:54.440 - 14:59.600:  he and a fellow prisoner set up this organization in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantab
15:00.020 - 15:06.480:  to help former detainees and the Syrian relatives of the missing. Riyadh is concerned that desperate
15:06.480 - 15:11.960:  families are paying large sums for information and receive nothing genuine in return.
15:12.440 - 15:22.020:  Most of them told us $5,000, $10,000, even a family, they saw their houses to pay the middleman.
15:22.600 - 15:24.300:  The amount can be even higher.
15:27.360 - 15:31.940:  I got tortured in the most cruel and brutal way. We even experienced sexual torture.
15:32.500 - 15:35.260:  We were taken to places I did not imagine we had in Syria.
15:35.680 - 15:40.140:  Muhammad Abbas Salam is traumatized by the torture he experienced in prison in Syria.
15:40.840 - 15:45.040:  He was arrested after taking part in a peaceful protest in Idlib against the government.
15:45.040 - 15:51.240:  In 2014, his family was given a death certificate saying he died of a heart attack,
15:51.460 - 15:53.620:  but his father refused to believe it.
15:53.960 - 16:00.340:  My father, God bless his soul, paid huge sums of money, more than $40,000 or $50,000,
16:00.340 - 16:06.140:  to try and get me out. He got in touch with the broker. I was released with the help of this guy.
16:06.480 - 16:09.080:  From Muhammad's family, paying did actually work.
16:09.720 - 16:13.020:  So is Riyadh's NGO right to deter people from doing this?
16:13.580 - 16:14.300:  Yes, he says.
16:14.520 - 16:21.560:  Most of them is from the intelligence itself and the authors, maybe they are working together.
16:22.100 - 16:28.860:  So they are either representative of the security apparatus themselves or somebody with connection to them.
16:28.860 - 16:32.440:  Of course, let me say they're working as a web.
16:32.660 - 16:37.760:  The United Nations has recently voted for the creation of an independent institution to tackle
16:37.760 - 16:42.400:  the issue of the missing in Syria. We asked the Syrian government whether they would be
16:42.400 - 16:48.380:  cooperating with this and for their response to the fact that 100,000 people are missing.
16:48.980 - 16:50.380:  We have had no reply.
16:51.180 - 16:55.560:  And you can hear more on this story, on assignment here on the BBC World Service.
16:58.760 - 17:04.780:  Still to come, on the Global News Podcast, NASA says it's going to try to find out if UFOs
17:04.780 - 17:12.360:  exist. And in doing so, shift the conversation from sensationalism to science,
17:12.360 - 17:18.460:  to make sure that information is shared transparently around the world.
17:26.500 - 17:32.500:  Italy's interior ministry says nearly 7,000 migrants who've crossed from North Africa
17:33.000 - 17:36.660:  have arrived on the island of Lampedusa in the last two days.
17:36.660 - 17:41.600:  That is more than the island's resident population, where the local mayor has called
17:41.600 - 17:45.340:  a state of emergency, calling for assistance. With more details,
17:45.340 - 17:48.120:  here's our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Abard.
17:49.060 - 17:53.920:  The Italian Red Cross has told the BBC that most of the recent arrivals are from Sub-Saharan
17:53.920 - 17:58.800:  and Northern Africa. Weather conditions have been favourable, with most of the boats arriving
17:58.800 - 18:04.780:  from Tunisia, the nearest point on the African coast. A Red Cross spokeswoman said providing assistance
18:04.780 - 18:09.380:  to such large numbers of people had been challenging, but she said by the end of Friday,
18:09.380 - 18:14.320:  more than 4,000 people should have been transferred to Sicily and other destinations in Italy.
18:15.000 - 18:20.260:  The politics of the situation remain complex and volatile. One Italian minister alleged,
18:20.260 - 18:23.200:  without providing evidence that the landings were organised,
18:23.200 - 18:26.760:  describing them as an act of war. Danny Abard.
18:27.180 - 18:31.460:  NASA is on a mission to find signs of unidentified life.
18:31.600 - 18:38.360:  The Space Agency commissioned a study last June into UFOs, or UAPs, unidentified
18:38.360 - 18:43.980:  anomalous phenomena, as it now prefers to call them, and has been giving a briefing
18:43.980 - 18:48.800:  into more than 800 unexplained events that have been collected over 27 years.
18:49.400 - 18:53.560:  Some of the world's leading data and AI scientists worked on this study.
18:54.020 - 18:57.280:  Here's NASA's chief, Bill Nelson, outlining its aims.
19:18.980 - 19:26.480:  Whatever we recommend, to make sure that information is shared transparently around the world.
19:27.460 - 19:31.260:  Our North America correspondent, Nomi Iqbal, was at the NASA briefing in Washington.
19:32.300 - 19:38.500:  When we went into the conference, of course, people get quite excited about anything to do with UFOs.
19:38.580 - 19:43.120:  They think that is NASA going to reveal something huge? Are we going to find out that there's
19:43.120 - 19:46.780:  life on another planet or anything like that? But of course, it's nothing of the sort.
19:46.920 - 19:52.700:  They said that this is about them being more transparent about what they know and what they
19:52.700 - 19:57.140:  don't know, and they say they just don't have enough data to understand what's out there.
19:57.500 - 20:01.280:  And Nomi, you mentioned the need for transparency in mind of NASA.
20:01.940 - 20:05.900:  And that, I imagine to a certain extent, is to do with what happened earlier on in the year,
20:05.900 - 20:11.340:  as well, because there was an awful lot of comment in a congressional hearing about a lack of transparency.
20:11.340 - 20:15.840:  That's right. Back in June, there were former military officers who gave really stunning
20:15.840 - 20:20.900:  evidence or stunning testimony, I should say, about UFOs, about alien life,
20:20.900 - 20:23.980:  accusing the US government in a nutshell of covering something up.
20:24.440 - 20:30.220:  Now, our team did put that to Mr Nelson, and he sort of questioned the credibility of
20:30.220 - 20:36.180:  specifically one of the witnesses and saying, look, all I want is facts, just give me evidence.
20:36.180 - 20:43.020:  But there's no denial that there is a huge spike in interest in UAPs as they call them,
20:43.400 - 20:46.420:  and they want to work closely with the government.
20:46.420 - 20:50.800:  They want to work closely with the military to try and understand UAPs more.
20:51.300 - 20:56.600:  It's extraordinary, isn't it? Because I can't remember it being this high profile for a very,
20:56.600 - 21:01.460:  very long time. Is that purely, do you think, because of the number of sightings going on?
21:01.580 - 21:07.220:  I think it's a lot to do with that. There's also the congressional hearing that you mentioned as well.
21:07.700 - 21:12.640:  If you remember back to earlier in the year, the alleged Chinese spy balloons, as well,
21:12.640 - 21:15.760:  I just think there's always been that fascination, hasn't there?
21:16.120 - 21:21.600:  And I said to Mr Nelson, you have rebranded this UAP. You're not using the term UFO.
21:21.640 - 21:25.260:  They want to broaden the definition of it, but it's also to destigmatise it.
21:25.540 - 21:30.680:  And I said to him, people use the term UFOs. I have to be honest, even when I'm saying UAPs,
21:30.680 - 21:34.580:  I get confused, is it UAP, UPA, because you want to say UFOs.
21:34.580 - 21:37.660:  And that's how the American public are. That's how people are globally.
21:37.660 - 21:42.180:  And he laughed, Mr Nelson. He said people will always have that sort of fantasy,
21:42.180 - 21:46.520:  Indiana Jones. I also mentioned the expires has probably done a lot of damage as well,
21:46.520 - 21:51.460:  which he laughed at, but NASA is a really ambitious objective of theirs to try and
21:51.780 - 21:55.340:  take all that sensationalism and turn it into something scientific.
21:56.000 - 22:02.900:  That was Nomiya Igbel. The French supermarket carful has put warning labels on products
22:02.900 - 22:08.920:  that are guilty of so-called shrink flation. This is when an item has become smaller in size,
22:08.920 - 22:13.680:  but the cost has gone up. The supermarket says the labels are to help shoppers,
22:14.100 - 22:19.640:  but that the move is also intended to pressure suppliers like Unilever and Nestle to rethink
22:19.640 - 22:22.440:  their pricing. From Paris, here's Hugh Scofield.
22:23.700 - 22:28.640:  In these times of very high inflation, a very interesting phenomenon here in France,
22:28.640 - 22:34.640:  the giant supermarket chain, carful. One of the biggest in the country is sticking it to the
22:34.640 - 22:40.060:  food industry in a very public way. We're in the soft drinks section. And next to a quite well-known
22:40.060 - 22:46.520:  brand of soft drink, there is a sign that says, shrink flation. This product has seen its quantity
22:46.520 - 22:51.520:  go down while the tariff you pay for what it contains has gone up. In other words,
22:51.520 - 22:57.400:  you are paying the same or more and you're getting less. Now, quite clearly, carful is doing this
22:57.400 - 23:02.200:  in order to show that it is on the side of the consumers. So how do they feel?
23:02.380 - 23:06.220:  I think it's great initiative. It's important to inform the consumers about what is happening
23:06.220 - 23:12.820:  so they can make informed choices. It's great that carful are doing this. Love is very expensive now,
23:13.200 - 23:18.520:  so if I see the price of something going up while the quantity goes down, I'm not going to buy it.
23:18.600 - 23:24.820:  I think that carful has been aware of the issue for months. It's not before. I mean,
23:24.820 - 23:31.440:  around juice they've been sold in a 900mm package for maybe three, four years.
23:31.820 - 23:37.000:  Now, the food industry is not taking this accusation lying down. It's pointed out that the number
23:37.000 - 23:43.000:  of products singled out by carful for this shrink flation treatment is actually tiny,
23:43.000 - 23:48.740:  which is perfectly true. Rather more pointedly, a consumer affairs group has accused the supermarket
23:48.740 - 23:55.860:  of hypocrisy that 99 cent of bag of potatoes in the cut price section still costs 99 cents,
23:55.900 - 23:59.140:  but there are now rather fewer potatoes inside it.
24:00.220 - 24:03.500:  Hughes go field reporting. Now, have a listen to this.
24:15.220 - 24:18.740:  Well, that is the kind of fiery debate that takes place almost every evening.
24:18.740 - 24:24.580:  On Indian television, but now the presenters themselves have come under fire. Members of the
24:24.580 - 24:29.920:  main oppositional alliance in India have decided to boycott television presenters who they say are
24:29.920 - 24:35.200:  legitimizing hate field rhetoric in the country. The alliance accused the presenters of
24:35.200 - 24:41.320:  favouring the governing Hindu BJP Nationalist Party and not giving enough media coverage
24:41.320 - 24:46.860:  to the opposition congress party leader Rahul Gandhi. One of the presenters being boycotted
24:46.860 - 24:53.380:  is Arnab Goswami. He is his response. And I want to say to them today, as they bring out this
24:53.760 - 24:59.620:  ridiculous boycott threat, bring it on. The people of this country are with us with me.
24:59.620 - 25:05.460:  We have the nation on our side because the nation is with Republic and Republic does not compromise.
25:06.240 - 25:11.020:  Our South Asia editor, Ambrassan Eteragen, tell me more about one of the oppositional
25:11.020 - 25:14.940:  alliance has taken the decision. See, what we heard in the first clip about
25:14.940 - 25:20.600:  gets talking over each other and the presenter yelling. It's only tip of the iceberg. If you watch
25:20.600 - 25:26.100:  some of this television channel debates in India and the evening, people really get angry,
25:26.260 - 25:32.480:  day in and day out, the civility that has gone. Now, this has become a real issue for opposition
25:32.500 - 25:37.940:  because what happened in the last nine years after the Hindu Nationalist BJP came to power?
25:38.080 - 25:43.120:  See, the job of a journalist to hold people in power accountable, but then the television debates
25:43.300 - 25:48.320:  were only questioning the opposition parties. And whatever Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress
25:48.320 - 25:54.300:  party was doing, the twisted speech. And most importantly, it's all about hateful rhetoric against
25:54.300 - 25:59.480:  minorities, against Muslims and Christians. Now, the opposition alliance says they have
25:59.640 - 26:05.120:  emogged these 14 presenters. On their shows, we are not going to go because they are not impartial.
26:05.440 - 26:09.960:  They are favoring a particular political party. They are threatening the social fabric of the
26:09.960 - 26:15.940:  country. And that is what the opposition alliance has decided. How's the governing BJP and all
26:15.940 - 26:20.600:  these media organizations? How they reacted to this? The Digital Broadcasters Association say,
26:20.740 - 26:25.380:  you know, this is a threat to the freedom of press. It's quite unprecedented because you are
26:25.380 - 26:30.480:  boycotting a certain number of television presenters, which means you're not able to put forward
26:30.480 - 26:35.520:  the other views. So it sends out a very strong message in terms of freedom of expression.
26:35.720 - 26:41.580:  And the BJP, the governing party, they have strongly condemned. But on the other side, for example,
26:41.580 - 26:47.080:  BBC calls the BJP spokesperson, they would not talk to us because they view BBCS anti-national
26:47.560 - 26:52.360:  and putting views against the interests of India. There are two different arguments here
26:52.840 - 26:57.860:  for the television presenters now to come out with what kind of answers they are going to give to this.
26:58.960 - 27:05.160:  Ambrassan Etterajan. Now, one of Australia's richest men has apologised after saying that
27:05.160 - 27:12.260:  unemployment should rise to remind arrogant workers of their place. Tim Gerner had claimed the
27:12.260 - 27:19.160:  COVID pandemic had changed employees' attitudes to work for the worse. He now says he deeply regrets
27:19.160 - 27:23.900:  the remarks, but as Phil Mercer reports from Sydney, that hasn't stopped the backlash.
27:24.900 - 27:30.200:  And federal MPs have slammed millionaire property developer Tim Gerner after he accused workers
27:30.200 - 27:36.880:  of being arrogant. Australia's TV news headlines have been dominated by a tycoon who's
27:36.880 - 27:42.780:  remarks have been condemned as shocking and offensive. On Tuesday, Tim Gerner said that the
27:42.780 - 27:48.580:  pandemic had made workers lazy. People decided they didn't really want to work so much anymore
27:48.580 - 27:52.980:  through COVID and that has had a massive issue on productivity. And we need to see that change.
27:52.980 - 27:58.020:  We need to see unemployment rise. Unemployment has to jump 40-50% in my view. We need to see
27:58.020 - 28:02.680:  painting the economy. We need to remind people that they work for the employer, not the other way
28:02.680 - 28:11.360:  around. The 40-50% rise in Australia's unemployment rate would see more than 200,000 people lose their jobs.
28:12.220 - 28:18.560:  Tim Gerner has apologised for his comments, but the fury they've ignited in the Australian media
28:18.560 - 28:34.540:  and beyond shows no sign of abating. Tim Gerner has had some support in the business community.
28:34.540 - 28:42.220:  It's not the first time he's lit the fuse on controversy. He made headlines in 2017 when he
28:42.220 - 28:47.900:  suggested young people couldn't afford to buy a home because they were spending too much on
28:47.900 - 28:55.160:  avocado toast and didn't work enough. I was Phil Mercer. Now, have you heard about the sharks
28:55.160 - 29:01.920:  on a golf course? It's not the start of a joke, but the subject of an academic study no less that
29:01.920 - 29:07.320:  has just been published in the journal Marine and Fishery Sciences. For the last 20 years,
29:07.320 - 29:12.720:  sharks have been living in a lake on a golf course near Brisbane in Queensland, Australia,
29:13.300 - 29:18.720:  and they've been able to survive surprisingly well in water, far less salty than they are used to.
29:19.340 - 29:24.540:  Scott Wakestaff is the general manager of Carbrook Golf Club. He told Evan Davis
29:24.960 - 29:30.040:  how the sharks ended up there. We've got a couple of big river systems next to our golf course,
29:30.060 - 29:35.240:  and what happens when it rains a lot was these rivers flood and inundate the golf course,
29:35.280 - 29:39.940:  and then in this case we've got a really big lake that was the result of sand mining.
29:39.940 - 29:46.400:  It's 21 hectares in size, and so the river comes over, dumps a few sharks in, and then it recedes
29:46.400 - 29:51.200:  and leaves them in there, and they grew up in this big lake, and yeah, that's sort of how it all
29:51.200 - 29:55.800:  happened at the start. And these are right next to the golf course. Oh, yeah, yeah. You have to play
29:55.800 - 30:00.980:  alongside the lake on a number of holes back in the day when they were seen a lot. It was quite
30:00.980 - 30:05.240:  common for a golfers to be just walking along, mining their own business, playing their golf,
30:05.240 - 30:09.820:  and then see a shark fin cruising only a few metres away from them. How dangerous
30:09.820 - 30:15.100:  are the bull sharks? They are very dangerous when you're in the water. Fortunately with us,
30:15.260 - 30:19.100:  the golfers stay on the land and the sharks stay in the water, and we haven't had a problem.
30:19.420 - 30:24.960:  This is not salt water in the lake, but these are salt water sharks. So this is why scientists have
30:24.960 - 30:29.900:  been quite interested in the experience of this community. It's not fresh water, it's brackish water,
30:29.900 - 30:34.940:  so it's in the middle where we're about six kilometres from the ocean. So the water has a high
30:34.980 - 30:39.520:  salinity, even though it's sort of in that middle part. But the sharks seem to be fine. They've got the
30:39.520 - 30:43.600:  fish in the lake, obviously, so they've got food and stuff. Yeah, it just sort of became its own
30:43.600 - 30:49.560:  little ecosystem for a very long time, and lots of fish in there and the sharks were happy. It was
30:49.760 - 30:55.900:  all you can eat pretty much, and they just grew up in their little happy environment, and so for
30:56.100 - 30:59.960:  the best part of 20 years, they just swam around and ate fish and scared golfers.
31:00.160 - 31:04.300:  And I understand that you did occasionally throw some meat in just to give them a little treat.
31:04.680 - 31:09.500:  I did, yes. More for camera action. I sort of had a little spot where I could put meat in the water
31:09.500 - 31:15.060:  and a couple of sharks were very well trained, and they would come in and appear, you know, almost
31:15.060 - 31:20.460:  within five or ten minutes. So yeah, I got to see them quite a lot. They'd come in and eat the meat
31:20.460 - 31:25.980:  very gently, not aggressively, and take the meat and off they'd go. What's happened to the sharks?
31:26.260 - 31:29.900:  They were in there for a very long time, and from what we understand, they sort of probably got
31:30.120 - 31:35.040:  a little bit old, and we had a bit of trouble with fishermen coming in at night time and trying
31:35.040 - 31:40.000:  to hook them up, and we lost a couple that way, and just through various interactions with the lake,
31:40.200 - 31:44.560:  they've just basically got to the end of their life. We're not really sure if the rivers have brought
31:44.560 - 31:49.040:  in some new life, or the lakes empty, but I wouldn't be going swimming in there just yet.
31:49.340 - 31:52.540:  Have you managed to use this as a marketing ploy for your golf course?
31:52.720 - 31:57.780:  Yeah, probably accidentally. YouTube and social media has helped us become a little bit better known
31:57.800 - 32:01.340:  than maybe we should be, and the club's changed its logo, and now we've got a little bit of a
32:01.400 - 32:06.880:  shark sort of feel to our logo, and I reckon we've squeezed a few miles out of our sharks, that's for sure.
32:07.460 - 32:09.580:  Scott Wagstalf speaking to Evan Davis.
32:12.680 - 32:16.700:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
32:16.700 - 32:20.980:  If you want a comment on this podcast, all the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
32:21.500 - 32:26.960:  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x,
32:26.960 - 32:32.680:  formerly known as Twitter, at Global News Podcast. This edition was mixed by Holly Palmer,
32:32.680 - 32:38.140:  and the producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nick Miles, and until next time,
32:38.520 - 32:38.680:  goodbye.
