*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.020* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.060- 00:23.780* :  I'm Robyn Brandt and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday 28 September, these are our main stories.
*00:24.400- 00:28.200* :  Predictions, there will soon be no Armenians left in Nagorno-Karabakh,
*00:28.620- 00:32.180* :  we're in the border town where tens of thousands are heading. There's a really big crowd,
*00:32.180- 00:37.100* :  lots of people milling around here, lots of people arriving all the time in cars and vehicles
*00:37.100- 00:42.060* :  packed with belongings. We look at the catastrophic melting of Switzerland's glaciers.
*00:44.540- 00:50.600* :  Also in this podcast, Barbie Fever reaches Russia and who wants to buy the first work from the man
*00:50.600- 00:55.880* :  who taught America to paint. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.
*00:55.980- 00:57.820* :  You too can paint almighty pictures.
*01:04.300- 01:09.500* :  Now we start the podcast in Azerbaijan. More than a week on, from the country's 24 hour
*01:09.500- 01:15.340* :  military victory in Nagorno-Karabakh, the huge outflow of people from the war-torn region continues.
*01:15.920- 01:20.960* :  Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan says in the coming days, he predicts there will be no
*01:20.960- 01:27.420* :  Armenians left in the enclave. It was thought to be home to around 120,000 of them. More than half
*01:27.420- 01:32.500* :  of this population has now left packing their belongings into cars and joining the queues of people
*01:32.500- 01:38.040* :  trying to leave via the only accessible road out. Our correspondent Sarah Rainsford described
*01:38.040- 01:43.180* :  the scenes where she is in the Armenian border town of Gorish. It seems busier this morning
*01:43.500- 01:47.980* :  than any of the days we've been here. There was a really big crowd. Lots of people milling around
*01:48.060- 01:53.840* :  here. Lots of people arriving all the time in cars and vehicles packed with belongings. We saw
*01:53.840- 01:59.620* :  one car passing us earlier with a cage full of chickens on the top and a kid's bike strapped
*01:59.620- 02:05.440* :  to the top of that. There is really kind of somber mood here as people are arriving. They're
*02:05.440- 02:10.120* :  exhausted. They're hungry. They've had an extremely long and difficult route out of Nagorno-Karabakh
*02:10.180- 02:15.080* :  through the mountains with a really long tail back. Some people have spent two days in their cars
*02:15.780- 02:21.100* :  waiting to get out to get through. They arrive here. They tumble out. I saw an old lady in a dressing
*02:21.100- 02:27.000* :  gown. I see lots of children sitting eating on the grass or wherever they can find a spot to sit
*02:27.000- 02:33.060* :  down. There's a massive aid effort underway here now. Not only the government trying to help people
*02:33.060- 02:38.020* :  here, but also local businesses bringing aid and local people offering their homes and rooms
*02:38.400- 02:43.440* :  for the refugees to stay in at least temporarily. It's been described to me as a matter of principle
*02:43.440- 02:48.000* :  to help out an Armenian official said, you know, that the people of Nagorno-Karabakh were there,
*02:48.300- 02:52.560* :  their brothers and sisters and that they needed to be helped. It was a moral duty and there is
*02:52.560- 02:57.720* :  definitely a huge rallying round here to help people, but the need, you know, the demand is
*02:57.720- 03:01.940* :  pretty enormous. And we keep asking this question, but I think it remains important. As a Bayesian
*03:01.940- 03:06.400* :  has reassured these people, they will be safe if they stay in Nagorno-Karabakh, but clearly,
*03:06.400- 03:10.800* :  tens of thousands, it seems like most of that population just don't believe those reassurances.
*03:11.160- 03:15.500* :  Yeah, and I think, you know, bear in mind, there have been so many wars, so much blood shared,
*03:15.500- 03:22.340* :  so much hatred and enmity over the years, that I guess that's what lays behind that, you know,
*03:22.480- 03:27.880* :  it's not that we've got reports of actual attacks or atrocities being committed inside the
*03:27.880- 03:31.740* :  Nagorno-Karabakh, but certainly that is the fear of everyone I speak to here. And remember,
*03:31.740- 03:36.220* :  many, many people in this crowd have either fought in Nagorno-Karabakh or they've lost members
*03:36.220- 03:40.400* :  of their family, close relatives and friends, and now they've left those graves behind in that
*03:40.400- 03:44.280* :  enclave as well. And they're also coming to terms of the fact there's now been a formal declaration
*03:44.820- 03:48.960* :  by the president, the separatist president of that enclave, that in fact it will cease to exist
*03:48.960- 03:53.080* :  at the end of this year, so a formal declaration of what these people here already know.
*03:53.640- 03:58.480* :  Sarah Rainsford reporting from the Armenian border. Authorities in Switzerland say the last two
*03:58.480- 04:04.120* :  years have been catastrophic for the country's glaciers. The latest analysis shows 10% of their
*04:04.120- 04:09.320* :  glacial volume has melted away, and they are predicting that some of them could completely disappear
*04:09.320- 04:15.040* :  within a generation. Dr. Matthias Huss, who's the head of glacier monitoring in Switzerland, says the
*04:15.040- 04:21.880* :  acceleration of the rate of loss is concerning. It's terrible to see that this extreme of last year
*04:21.880- 04:27.060* :  is just repeating, even though it feels a bit less extreme because we have already seen this.
*04:27.460- 04:31.740* :  And I'm also a bit worried about this because we might get used to these
*04:32.420- 04:36.700* :  news of all these extremes we're seeing, not just for the glaciers, but everywhere in the climate
*04:36.700- 04:44.060* :  system, but this is not just normal. It's completely exceptional. Well, for more of an explanation
*04:44.060- 04:50.700* :  on this, I spoke to our correspondence in Switzerland, image and focus. In 2022, we had this record
*04:50.700- 04:58.340* :  ever loss of 6% of the ice volume. This year, it's a little bit less. It's 4%.
*04:59.200- 05:04.760* :  But the glacier experts I've been talking to say that's absolutely no reason for complacency.
*05:04.760- 05:10.800* :  If you take those two together, that's 10% in two years more than the glacier has lost in the
*05:10.800- 05:19.960* :  30 years between 1960 and 1990. So it's an acceleration. Some glaciers have actually disappeared.
*05:19.960- 05:24.300* :  They've discontinued the measuring of at least one of them this summer because it's just gone.
*05:24.300- 05:29.980* :  There's nothing left to measure. And even the bigger ones, the Alec glacier, which is the most
*05:30.240- 05:37.340* :  magnificent thing I've been up there to see it, it's 800 meters thick in parts. But the level of
*05:37.340- 05:43.660* :  melt now, they say, if nothing changes with global warming, if we are heading towards that 2%,
*05:44.560- 05:49.840* :  that glacier too will be gone in a generation. And let's ask the obvious bit important question
*05:49.840- 05:55.800* :  they are making a direct correlation between this and between man-made climate change.
*05:56.180- 06:03.560* :  Yes, they are. I mean, they say there's absolutely no doubt that global warming is associated
*06:03.560- 06:12.440* :  with man-made greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel use and the rise in global temperature.
*06:12.440- 06:18.540* :  Glaciers are especially sensitive to that. The Alpine environment is especially sensitive to that.
*06:18.540- 06:24.480* :  The average temperature there is rising actually faster than the global average.
*06:25.100- 06:30.440* :  And they are interestingly, one of the experts I talked to yesterday, he said, they are like the
*06:30.440- 06:35.760* :  ambassadors of climate change, the glaciers, because they are telling us this is not good.
*06:36.440- 06:41.200* :  And let's not forget, this is not just a nice view, the Alps and the ice on them.
*06:41.200- 06:47.240* :  These are what's called the water towers of Europe, because they store the winter snow and release
*06:47.240- 06:53.000* :  it gradually, it goes into Europe's rivers. For the river freight, it goes to water Europe's crops,
*06:53.000- 06:59.360* :  it goes to cool Europe's nuclear power stations. So, losing that water, if it happens,
*06:59.360- 07:01.960* :  we'll have a big environmental impact.
*07:01.960- 07:08.260* :  Imagine folks, the global tech giant Meta owner of Facebook and WhatsApp is giving its AI chat bots
*07:08.260- 07:13.180* :  personalities, which means if you use them to answer questions or find out information,
*07:13.280- 07:17.260* :  you'll be interacting with something a little less like a computer, and just a bit more,
*07:17.260- 07:21.980* :  like you. Our technology correspondent James Clayton told Jeanette Gillil more.
*07:22.740- 07:26.420* :  You might have a request about what kind of country you would like to go on holiday,
*07:26.460- 07:32.720* :  or you might have a question about cooking, and there are individual chat bots that can
*07:32.720- 07:38.900* :  answer you. And on top of that, there are also chat bots that have celebrity characters attached
*07:38.920- 07:45.400* :  to them. So, for example, the NFL's Tom Brady, who will give sports advice. So, it's a kind of
*07:45.580- 07:51.620* :  a new wave of chat bots that actually have personalities. It's not just about answering questions.
*07:52.140- 07:58.120* :  And this has been described as the latest salvo in a chat bot arms race, because we've also got
*07:58.120- 08:05.740* :  an announcement by Meta's rival, OpenAI, creator of chat GPT, which is confirming that its chat bot
*08:05.740- 08:12.100* :  can provide users with up-to-date information. So, this really is a battle to get to users to
*08:12.380- 08:16.900* :  go for their product, if you like. One of the kind of issues with some of these chat bots is they're
*08:16.900- 08:23.080* :  not actually relevant on real-time data. So, they can be out of date when you ask it a question.
*08:23.080- 08:28.320* :  Now, that's kind of important if it's going up against a search engine. So, that's what we've
*08:28.320- 08:32.860* :  seen today from chat GPT. This very much is an arms race, and that's what you're seeing today.
*08:32.860- 08:36.720* :  Two big companies based in California with two big announcements.
*08:37.100- 08:42.380* :  Yes, the Mark Zuckerberg is talking about this being an amazing year for AI, but it hasn't been
*08:42.380- 08:46.980* :  so amazing for his pet project, the Metaverse. Where is yet with that?
*08:46.980- 08:52.340* :  The idea of the Metaverse is that you spend at least part of your time in a sort of virtual
*08:52.340- 08:56.440* :  reality world where you can meet your friends and you can play games and you can work,
*08:56.440- 09:03.740* :  but based in another type of reality. So, you can do quote-unquote almost anything, but in a virtual
*09:03.740- 09:10.060* :  world. But it's not catching on. The problem he has is that so far since 2022, reality labs that
*09:10.060- 09:16.660* :  creates essentially the Metaverse for Meta has lost 21 billion dollars. Next year, it's going to
*09:16.660- 09:21.620* :  lose even more year on year than it has this year. So, he has pumped tens and tens of billions of
*09:21.620- 09:26.660* :  dollars into this thing. The problem is that so far there's a very little evidence that this is
*09:26.840- 09:31.880* :  VR and AR is anything more than just kind of a niche thing. People aren't spending lots of time
*09:31.880- 09:36.860* :  in virtual reality. And the other problem he has is that the thing that he's created that is
*09:36.860- 09:42.540* :  most like a Metaverse. It's called Horizon Worlds. You can play it on the quest which Meta's
*09:42.980- 09:48.920* :  mixed reality headset has terrible reviews. Very often when you play it, there's almost no one
*09:49.200- 09:54.300* :  who is actually in these worlds with you. The graphics look pretty bad. It's just a very,
*09:54.300- 10:00.820* :  very poor version of what's Mark Zuckerberg articulated. James Layton, we're then honest take.
*10:01.840- 10:06.620* :  Now Taiwan has unveiled its first ever domestically made submarine as its seeks to counter China's
*10:06.620- 10:12.680* :  growing naval might. The islands decided to develop its own boats after failing to find anyone
*10:12.680- 10:17.460* :  willing to build one for it. Here's Mickey Brister. More than two decades ago, the United States
*10:17.460- 10:22.620* :  promised to build and sell Taiwan a fleet of submarines. But the deal never materialized,
*10:22.960- 10:28.400* :  partly because of objections from China, which considers Taiwan its own territory. Several
*10:28.400- 10:34.400* :  European nations also declined to help. So in 2016, the island decided to build its own.
*10:34.880- 10:40.180* :  This submarine, unveiled by the President who ordered it, is the first of eight. It will now
*10:40.180- 10:46.040* :  undergo sea trials and should be operational in two years' time. Taiwan will hope it deters the
*10:46.040- 10:52.460* :  threat from China. Now considering the scale of anti-Western rhetoric in Russia at the moment,
*10:52.460- 10:57.180* :  you may be surprised that a true American icon has been pulling in the crowd to Moscow.
*10:57.180- 11:03.160* :  Despite Western sanctions, Barbie, or rather the Barbie feature film, has found its way onto the
*11:03.160- 11:08.700* :  Russian big screen, a pirated version, that is. Russian politicians have denounced it as an advert
*11:08.700- 11:13.340* :  for the American way of life, and the Russian authorities are laying on more patriotic types of
*11:13.340- 11:17.800* :  entertainment to try to rally support for their government. From Moscow, here's our Russia editor,
*11:17.800- 11:25.080* :  Steve Rosenberg. I'm in a Moscow cinema, and there's something rather odd happening.
*11:25.680- 11:32.340* :  People are buying tickets too, and actually paying a lot of money to see a pretty obscure 15-minute
*11:32.340- 11:37.820* :  Russian film called Speed Dating. But although the name of the movie is on the tickets,
*11:38.620- 11:40.860* :  this is not the main event of the evening.
*11:41.720- 11:44.740* :  Hello, Barbie! Hello, Barbie! Hello, Barbie! Hello, Barbie!
*11:44.940- 11:50.200* :  Inside the movie theater, the mystery is solved. The real reason people are here
*11:50.920- 11:57.800* :  is to watch Barbie, a pirated copy. Hollywood studios stopped official releases in Russia
*11:58.360- 12:01.180* :  after the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*12:03.500- 12:10.040* :  Russia's culture ministry is not amused by any of this. It suggested that the Barbie movie
*12:10.340- 12:14.260* :  has little in common with what it calls traditional Russian values.
*12:15.440- 12:22.380* :  But the cinema-goers I spoke to were tickled pink that Barbieland has well landed.
*12:22.880- 12:28.920* :  I think it's good that Russian cinema and theaters, they are able to show, no matter what,
*12:29.400- 12:34.960* :  those films for us. Because of that, we are able to not miss a huge part of the culture.
*12:34.960- 12:41.320* :  It's great that we have an opportunity to share our cultural experiences. It is about
*12:41.880- 12:46.820* :  being open-minded to other cultures. But in Russia, Barbie has enemies.
*12:47.360- 12:53.840* :  Some girls, especially the teens, are trying to be like a Barbie doll, and they exhaust their body.
*12:54.580- 12:59.340* :  MP Maria Bhutina has called for Barbie dolls to be banned from Russian kindergarten,
*13:00.580- 13:01.520* :  and that's for the film.
*13:01.940- 13:08.640* :  So for me personally, it's so far from the reality that I don't think it promotes what Russia wants
*13:08.640- 13:12.580* :  to bring through the world today. It does Russia want to bring to the world.
*13:12.700- 13:19.140* :  Well, some people call it traditional values. How can you talk about values as a representative
*13:19.140- 13:25.340* :  of a country that has invaded its neighbor? Well, you know, we have a different position on that.
*13:25.400- 13:28.960* :  We believe that actually NATO was so aggressive to us.
*13:29.240- 13:35.980* :  You hear this a lot from Russian officials accusing NATO, America, the west of threatening Russia,
*13:36.700- 13:43.340* :  when it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. This alternative reality is designed to deflect
*13:43.340- 13:50.980* :  criticism from the Kremlin and to boost patriotic fervor at home, more motherland rather than
*13:51.320- 14:02.220* :  Barbieland. 140 miles from Moscow, bootleg Barbie has yet to reach the town of Shokina.
*14:03.000- 14:06.960* :  Here I discover a very different kind of entertainment.
*14:14.940- 14:21.680* :  Up on stage at the local theatre, four paratroopers in military fatigues are singing about patriotism
*14:22.060- 14:27.040* :  and Russian invincibility. One of the songs is about the war in Ukraine.
*14:28.320- 14:35.500* :  We will serve the motherland and destroy the enemy they crew.
*14:36.400- 14:42.080* :  The audience are waving Russian flags and films are being projected onto a big screen.
*14:42.960- 14:48.940* :  No Barbie or Ken instead soldiers and images of Vladimir Putin.
*14:50.280- 14:57.040* :  But does the patriotic messaging work? To find out later on the streets of Shokina.
*14:57.620- 15:06.140* :  I decide to ask people about the Barbie film. Andrei tells me he's a patriot and prefers Russian
*15:06.140- 15:15.880* :  movies. But Diana wouldn't mind watching Barbie. To be a cultured, sociable, interesting person,
*15:15.880- 15:21.680* :  she says, you need to watch films. Trouble is being cultured and sociable.
*15:22.060- 15:24.260* :  I'm not Russia's priorities right now.
*15:29.080- 15:32.940* :  The race for the White House is definitely up and running, but guess who skipped the republican
*15:32.940- 15:38.360* :  debate again? You're not here tonight because you're afraid of being on the stage and defending
*15:38.360- 15:42.680* :  your record. You're ducking these things. And let me tell you what's going to happen. You keep
*15:42.680- 15:46.220* :  doing that. No one of that appears going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're going to call you Donald
*15:46.220- 15:46.540* :  Duck.
*15:52.660- 15:59.400* :  From global current affairs to art, science and culture, the documentary from the BBC World
*15:59.400- 16:06.820* :  Service tells the world's stories. Search for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:10.460- 16:15.020* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast. The race for the White House and it is a race if the
*16:15.020- 16:19.700* :  latest round of opinion polls are accurate, got another step closer in the US on Wednesday
*16:20.280- 16:24.920* :  when the leading contenders to challenge Joe Biden from the republican side gathered for a live
*16:24.920- 16:30.260* :  debate. It was the second time that they'd gone before the cameras, except yet again the front
*16:30.260- 16:35.980* :  runner wasn't there. Donald Trump vying for a second go at being president refused to take part.
*16:36.400- 16:38.720* :  Our North America correspondent Peter Bowers was watching.
*16:41.800- 16:47.020* :  Seven would be republican candidates for the presidency. The second debate to help whittle
*16:47.020- 16:52.580* :  down the field took place at the Reagan presidential library in California, again without the front
*16:52.580- 16:57.600* :  runner and former president Donald Trump. A point at least two of the candidates, Florida
*16:57.600- 17:03.020* :  Governor Ron DeSantis and Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, were determined to
*17:03.020- 17:08.180* :  highlight. You're not here tonight because you're afraid of being on the stage and defending your
*17:08.180- 17:12.680* :  record. You're ducking these things and let me tell you what's going to happen. You keep doing that.
*17:13.100- 17:16.040* :  No one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're going to call you Donald Duck.
*17:18.040- 17:23.600* :  The debate itself was scrappy full of interruptions and all out shouting matches between the candidates.
*17:23.600- 17:29.860* :  But China loomed large amongst the concerns with the multi-millionaire businessman Vivek Ramaswamy
*17:29.860- 17:35.840* :  positioning himself as the best able to deal with the superpower. We're only going to ever get to
*17:35.840- 17:41.800* :  declaring independence from China, which I favor if we actually win. There's exactly one person in
*17:41.800- 17:45.900* :  the republican party, which talks a big game about reaching young people. And that's me. And
*17:45.900- 17:49.640* :  let me know. The former South Carolina governor and UN diplomat Nikki Haley,
*17:50.260- 17:54.920* :  objected to the political newcomers' approach to the China-based social media up TikTok,
*17:54.920- 18:01.700* :  sounding exasperated when he defended its use. This is infuriating because TikTok is one of the
*18:01.700- 18:07.120* :  most dangerous social media assets that we could have. And once you've got, I honestly, every time
*18:07.120- 18:11.460* :  I hear you, I feel a little bit dumber for what you say, because I... One issue that's currently
*18:11.460- 18:17.480* :  challenging republicans, whether to continue providing financial aid to Ukraine, again exposed
*18:17.480- 18:22.820* :  divisions between the candidates. Rondesanta said he wouldn't offer Kiev a blank check.
*18:22.820- 18:27.120* :  And as president, he would spend more on fixing America's problems.
*18:27.120- 18:33.280* :  Our own country is being invaded. We don't even have control of our own territory. We have
*18:33.280- 18:37.840* :  got to defend the American people before we even worry about all these other things.
*18:37.840- 18:43.740* :  And America first messaged that echoes the views of Donald Trump. He wasn't there, but his
*18:43.740- 18:49.220* :  agenda was, with several of the candidates voicing concerns over the southern border with Mexico
*18:49.220- 18:58.840* :  and illegal immigration. Far away from California, Donald Trump was addressing striking
*18:58.840- 19:04.340* :  car workers near Detroit in Michigan. He made only a fleeting reference to the debate
*19:04.340- 19:09.740* :  happening on the West Coast. It's all over television to speech. You know, we're competing with the
*19:09.980- 19:15.240* :  job candidates. They're all running for a job. No, they're all job candidates. They want to be in
*19:16.260- 19:21.040* :  the, they want to do anything. Secretary of something. They even say VP. I don't know.
*19:21.040- 19:25.560* :  Does anybody see any VP in the group? I don't think so. A spokesman for the Trump campaign
*19:25.560- 19:31.260* :  described the debate as boring and inconsequential, adding that nothing was said that would change
*19:31.260- 19:36.840* :  the dynamics of the contest. Recent opinion polls have suggested the former president is pulling
*19:36.840- 19:42.560* :  ahead of Joe Biden. But there's more than a year to go until the election, with multiple criminal
*19:42.560- 19:48.320* :  and civil trials for the former president to navigate while he's campaigning. Peter Bose in the
*19:48.320- 19:54.900* :  US. Let's have our second look at artificial intelligence in this podcast. Can AI help make
*19:54.900- 20:00.600* :  brain surgery less complicated? Well, trainee surgeons have started using an AI tool to help guide
*20:00.600- 20:05.580* :  them through procedures. It's hope that the new technology being developed at University College
*20:05.580- 20:11.400* :  here in London could be used by surgeons during live surgery within two years time. The BBC's
*20:11.400- 20:18.980* :  Global Health Correspondence, Tulip Mazinda has more. In a darkened room, a latex face peeps through
*20:18.980- 20:26.560* :  blue surgical drapes. All focus is on the nose as the endoscope, a long, thin tube with a small
*20:26.560- 20:33.720* :  camera inside, is pushed up the left nostril towards the centre of the brain. What are those
*20:34.200- 20:38.900* :  structures here based on the AI, can you see? Right and left, crotted aren't you? Yeah.
*20:39.120- 20:44.960* :  Nicola Newell is one of the first trainee surgeons to use artificial intelligence to learn how to
*20:44.960- 20:52.980* :  do keyhole brain surgery. Today, she's trying to remove a tumour from the grape-sized pituitary gland.
*20:53.700- 20:59.480* :  We have a simulated pituitous operation here. The first screen is a camera footage from the
*20:59.480- 21:04.480* :  little endoscope and it's displaying the inside of this patient's brain. That's consultant
*21:04.480- 21:09.660* :  Neurosurgeon, Honey Markers, who's overseeing teaching today and is leading this AI project.
*21:10.060- 21:15.040* :  And on the other screen adjacent to it, you have the AI which is analysing this video in real time
*21:15.040- 21:20.600* :  and identifying not just the chema but also the surrounding structures. So what I'm looking at here
*21:20.600- 21:25.600* :  is it's inside the brain. There's lots of different areas that are lit up different colour,
*21:25.600- 21:30.380* :  so the middle is blue, you've got sort of pink, and that's the AI identifying that. What's it telling you?
*21:30.620- 21:35.600* :  Yes, that's right. So the blue right in the centre is the tumour itself. The structures around
*21:35.600- 21:40.420* :  are generally things you're trying to avoid. At the very bottom there in purple are the blood vessels
*21:40.420- 21:45.880* :  that supply your brain and injuring those blood vessels can result in a patient dying.
*21:46.020- 21:51.260* :  From the AI, we know now from some studies, it does a very good job at defining this boundary
*21:51.460- 21:56.240* :  and surgeons like myself, even if you were experienced with the help of AI, do a better job
*21:56.340- 22:01.640* :  to find that boundary and without AI. This AI system has learned from watching and analysing more
*22:01.640- 22:07.660* :  than 200 videos of this type of surgery. It would take your average brain surgeon around 10 years
*22:07.660- 22:12.780* :  to gain that level of experience, but it's taken this system around 10 months.
*22:13.080- 22:16.960* :  You could in a few years have an AI system that has seen more operations than any human
*22:16.960- 22:22.460* :  has ever or could ever see. We've just come into the lab, which is next door to the mock theatre,
*22:23.000- 22:28.680* :  and this is where two of the researchers who are teaching the AI about brain surgery are doing
*22:28.680- 22:34.340* :  some of their work. Should we have a look at the tumour recession phase to discuss the AI that
*22:34.340- 22:39.560* :  today? One of them is Danielle Khan, who's a neurosurgery trainee and AI researcher.
*22:39.860- 22:45.260* :  How do you make sure what you're teaching the AI is absolutely correct, that it's not going to
*22:45.260- 22:50.560* :  sort of run away with itself with information that is possibly incomplete? The type of AI we use
*22:50.560- 22:55.840* :  is called supervised learning. Everything that we put into it is something that we've taken a look at
*22:56.160- 23:01.700* :  as an entire team of experts. That looks like myself and some of the other members of our team
*23:01.700- 23:08.340* :  spending hundreds of hours making sure that the information we're feeding the AI is as accurate
*23:08.340- 23:13.520* :  as it can be. Like the technology itself, regulation around artificial intelligence in health care
*23:13.520- 23:19.140* :  is still evolving. Researchers here at UCL say they are working to develop national guidance and
*23:19.140- 23:24.560* :  have very robust systems in place for their own work. They're also in touch with doctors in
*23:24.560- 23:29.560* :  lower and middle income countries to see how this tech could be used elsewhere. I think it's going
*23:29.560- 23:35.640* :  to be huge and I think it's going to be creating a whole different set of specialists for us.
*23:35.740- 23:40.600* :  That's consultant neurosurgeon Mahmoud Kureshi in Nairobi. He chairs the neurological
*23:40.660- 23:46.560* :  society of Kenya and says he's excited by the new tech, but emphasizes that it would need to be
*23:46.560- 23:54.380* :  implemented very carefully. We would want that technology to be promoted but also to be evaluated
*23:54.380- 24:01.540* :  in a collaborative fashion. We can adapt it to our needs. When you get that compilation through AI
*24:01.540- 24:08.540* :  of a large number of surgeries done efficiently and you learn from it, the trainees are going to
*24:08.540- 24:13.860* :  pick this up much more quicker, turning them into better surgeons, reducing the mobility and
*24:13.860- 24:19.220* :  mortality of our patients in a, I believe, a significant way if we use it correctly.
*24:19.980- 24:25.200* :  That was consultant neurosurgeon Mahmoud Kureshi ending that report from my colleague Tulip
*24:25.200- 24:30.560* :  Mazimder. We're going to look back now at the life of a veteran actor who you'll have seen if you've
*24:30.560- 24:35.660* :  watched some or even all of the Harry Potter movies. Michael Gambon, who was best known for playing
*24:35.660- 24:39.240* :  Dumbledore in most of those films has died. He was 82.
*24:41.320- 24:48.460* :  In our times, I forget how much you've grown. At times, I still see the small boy from recovered.
*24:49.380- 24:53.600* :  He began his career as one of the original members of the Royal National Theatre in London.
*24:53.600- 25:00.460* :  In 2009, he spoke to the BBC about his time with that company and said this to Sumagrega about
*25:00.460- 25:05.820* :  his audition. I'd done some plays at Unity Theatre, which is a communist theatre in Camden Town
*25:06.440- 25:12.480* :  and I'd done a West End Understudy part and auditioned for the National Theatre and they took
*25:12.480- 25:17.820* :  me as a walk-on. I couldn't believe it. It was wonderful. Because your first choice of career was
*25:18.020- 25:23.260* :  was an aircraft mechanic, is it? Yeah, yeah. So now I came all that up and I auditioned for
*25:23.260- 25:29.540* :  Solorans. I was so thick. I didn't know he played Richard III and I did, Richard III.
*25:31.880- 25:34.200* :  What you did, the opening solution? Peter, what are you going to do? I said,
*25:34.200- 25:37.940* :  Richard III, you say, which part are you going to play? I said, Richard III, because yes,
*25:37.940- 25:42.560* :  I know, but are you going to play Buckingham, Kate Spree, one of those parts? I said, no.
*25:43.100- 25:47.700* :  He said, what are you going to play the main role? I said, yeah. But I didn't realise he was just
*25:47.700- 25:53.060* :  laughing. And I started, was there a bit of woman in this humour where he said, no, no, no,
*25:53.060- 25:58.060* :  it's you can't do that, that's close to me. You have to walk away from me so that I can see you
*25:58.060- 26:03.140* :  in full length. And next day they rang out and said, you can start on Monday. He tells a great
*26:03.140- 26:07.820* :  story, doesn't he? Well Fiona Shaw, who, like Michael Gambon, was born in Ireland and was also in
*26:07.820- 26:13.680* :  the Harry Potter films, spoke to Sarah Montague about him. I remember him saying, I just follow
*26:13.680- 26:19.480* :  chaos theory. He said, so if a part came from the National Theatre, he would say yes. And if a part
*26:19.480- 26:24.260* :  came, like Penny's, you know, he, from the television, he would do that. And if a movie came,
*26:24.260- 26:29.540* :  he would do that. So he varied his career remarkably and never judged what he was doing. He just
*26:29.540- 26:35.340* :  played. And he did once say to me in a car, he said, you know, I know I go on a lot about this
*26:35.380- 26:41.400* :  and that, but actually in the end, there is only acting. And I think he was always pretending.
*26:41.400- 26:46.400* :  He didn't take it seriously, but he took it profoundly seriously. I have to ask you about them,
*26:46.420- 26:50.540* :  sort of the most recent production of course, Harry Potter. Well, what was that like? He was
*26:50.540- 26:55.240* :  dumbledore. So he was in the Wizard Kingdom. I was in the Muggle Kingdom. But he was, you know,
*26:56.080- 27:00.200* :  he took over from Richard Harris. And of course, he began to mimic Richard Harris, who had
*27:00.200- 27:04.740* :  recently died. And he would do his accent or the slight Irish accent, which of course he always
*27:04.740- 27:09.500* :  loved having an excuse to do because his family had come from Ireland and gone to live in Camden.
*27:09.520- 27:14.880* :  And he used to say that his father used to go into a shop and wrap material around his
*27:15.260- 27:19.800* :  waist and then put on his overcoat and leave. But he always was hinting at a sort of criminal
*27:19.800- 27:26.120* :  activity. But I'm sure it didn't happen. He just loved the precariousness of reality and on
*27:26.120- 27:30.520* :  reality. And of course, that made him a very great actor. Can I ask you just briefly how you will
*27:30.520- 27:36.360* :  remember him? Well, I remember him because he was also a gunmaker, you know, he could make
*27:36.360- 27:42.760* :  guns. And he was always, he could, he could fool the V&A and believe it, they were 18th century guns.
*27:43.360- 27:47.900* :  So I would think of him as a trickster, I mean, just a brilliant magnificent trickster. But with
*27:47.900- 27:51.980* :  text, there was nothing like him, he could do anything. The actress Fiona Shaw, remembering
*27:51.980- 27:58.140* :  dumbledore, Michael Gambon. Now, we're going to end on a painting from the man who taught America
*27:58.140- 28:04.280* :  to paint a work by Bob Ross, the first piece he painted on his first TV show has gone on sale,
*28:04.280- 28:09.700* :  and the asking price is almost $10 million. You may not know his name, but the man with a large
*28:09.700- 28:15.900* :  head of curly hair and unruly beard and a certain laid back style became famous teaching Americans
*28:15.900- 28:21.220* :  to paint in the 1980s. I think each of us, sometime during our life, has wanted to paint a picture.
*28:22.220- 28:27.360* :  I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. And here we will try to
*28:27.360- 28:33.240* :  show you how to bring that artist out to put it on canvas because you too can paint all mighty
*28:34.460- 28:39.080* :  pictures. Well, the first program aired in 1983, he went on to record 11 years of episodes
*28:39.080- 28:44.940* :  before he died in 1995. He continues, though, to have a massive following on YouTube. The painting
*28:44.940- 28:49.220* :  on sale is called A Walk in the Woods and it's owned by the Art Dealer Ryan Nelson.
*28:49.820- 28:56.620* :  He is an artist that has transcended generation after generation. I was five years into the building
*28:56.620- 29:01.980* :  of Modern Art Effect, which started roughly 15 years ago and I decided that I thought it would be
*29:01.980- 29:06.900* :  cool to own a Bob Ross painting and fast forward to today. We found the greatest treasure. We
*29:06.900- 29:13.460* :  found what you could call his rookie card. This is one of one season one episode one out of 400
*29:13.460- 29:20.280* :  on air paintings. What started at all? Currently, there's 350,000 people that search for Bob Ross
*29:20.280- 29:26.520* :  on a regular basis to this day. That is almost double what they search for in terms of war hall
*29:26.560- 29:32.840* :  or Picasso. So the 10 million dollar number, you look at 200 million dollar war halls that are a
*29:32.840- 29:37.840* :  photo that he didn't take. I love war hall. He's in my collection. 10 million is not a lot to ask
*29:37.840- 29:43.000* :  on this price. But Ryan, for an artist to say that everybody could paint and his aim was that
*29:43.440- 29:47.940* :  you could pick up the brush. You don't need to be blessed by Michelangelo to create a masterpiece.
*29:47.940- 29:54.120* :  Does this seem like an irony to ask for this kind of a price? No, not at all. In fact, I mean,
*29:54.120- 29:59.900* :  he was an expert on the wet on wet technique. But Bob Ross didn't go on to the air to tell
*29:59.900- 30:05.760* :  everyone that he was a great painter. He went on air to deliver a message to us all. And that
*30:05.760- 30:10.440* :  message is what the collectors will see in this painting and what people see when they watch the show.
*30:10.440- 30:15.720* :  And you can believe in yourself. You can accomplish something that maybe you didn't think you could
*30:15.720- 30:20.380* :  accomplish. When you look at one of his paintings and you start an episode, you think yourself,
*30:20.380- 30:25.700* :  there's no way that I can do it. But he brings that belief to you and it's something to bring in
*30:25.700- 30:30.020* :  to your entire life. Ryan Nelson on Bob Ross speaking to my colleague,
*30:30.020- 30:36.620* :  Divina Gupta. And that's all from us for now. But there will be a new edition of the Global News
