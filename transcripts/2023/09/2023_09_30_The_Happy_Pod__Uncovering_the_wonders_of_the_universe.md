*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.600* :  by advertising. I'm Dr. Laurie Santos, host of the Happiness Lab podcast. It's never too late
*00:20.600- 00:25.640* :  or too early to learn how to feel happier. So my new season has well-being tips for you whether
*00:25.640- 00:30.880* :  you're aged three or a hundred and six like me. Did I mention I have some amazing co-hosts
*00:30.880- 00:36.160* :  for this season? I do not forget cute and furry! How could I grover? I'll be joined by my fabulous
*00:36.160- 00:43.120* :  friends from Sesame Street. That's us! I'm so excited! Be sure to listen wherever you get your
*00:43.160- 00:47.040* :  podcasts. Oh, I am so excited! This is going to be so magical!
*00:51.980- 00:59.120* :  From global current affairs to art, science and culture, the documentary from the BBC World Service
*00:59.720- 01:06.000* :  tells the world's stories. Search for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*01:08.160- 01:12.840* :  Hi, I'm Susie and should you find yourself having an attack of the mobile bubbles
*01:13.340- 01:18.000* :  then you probably need the happy pod. Well, it's just as well we're here then. This is the happy
*01:18.000- 01:29.440* :  pod from the BBC World Service. I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 30th
*01:29.440- 01:35.020* :  of September. It's just a very exciting thing when that capsule opens to see for the first time
*01:35.020- 01:41.380* :  this material that no other human has seen before. The thrill of new science as samples are
*01:41.380- 01:48.440* :  recovered from the asteroid Bennu. There's jubilation in East Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
*01:50.340- 01:55.380* :  With the announcement of the hosts of the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations, we'll hear about the people
*01:55.380- 02:01.260* :  hoping their alternative to palm oil will lead to healthier food and less deforestation.
*02:01.800- 02:05.800* :  I mean we started this just to, is it possible? We just thought, how hard can it be?
*02:06.000- 02:09.280* :  There was a bit like that but then we discovered who heard it was.
*02:10.440- 02:15.200* :  Also in this podcast, it just always makes children love this one.
*02:16.880- 02:18.120* :  And we'll be finding out why.
*02:25.020- 02:30.760* :  Now we might have just taken a small step closer to finding out how life on Earth began.
*02:30.860- 02:37.620* :  A capsule landed safely in the Utah Desert in the US containing fragments of the asteroid Bennu
*02:38.000- 02:44.380* :  and NASA workers described the rapid operation to retrieve it as awesome. Scientists around the world
*02:44.380- 02:49.640* :  are now coming together to find out what exactly this material can tell us about our solar system.
*02:50.240- 02:54.720* :  One of those scientists is Sarah Russell from the Natural History Museum here in London.
*02:55.240- 02:59.280* :  It's going to be sent around the world so there's over 200 scientists around the world on the
*02:59.280- 03:04.720* :  science team so we can hopefully come together and we'll all get a chance to look at it using
*03:04.720- 03:10.300* :  our own instruments and our own expertise. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos was in Utah
*03:10.300- 03:15.020* :  to see the recovery of the capsule and he told us about the excitement among the international
*03:15.020- 03:21.620* :  scientific community. Well when the capsule landed in Utah was a very exciting day. It was very
*03:21.620- 03:27.380* :  quickly moved to a military base and they took the capsule apart and that revealed the inner
*03:27.380- 03:33.060* :  canister and that was moved very quickly down to the Johnson Space Center in Houston and they
*03:33.060- 03:38.460* :  actually opened the inner canister on Tuesday and I have to say it was a bit of a mess inside.
*03:38.460- 03:43.580* :  There was sample all over the place which kind of speaks to how much material they've got
*03:44.140- 03:50.300* :  and they've now got the job in the next few weeks of picking up every last little rock inside
*03:50.300- 03:56.020* :  that canister, every last little dust grain. They wanted all and it's going to take some time
*03:56.020- 04:01.120* :  and that work will be led by Chris Sneed who's the deputy curator on the Osiris Rex mission.
*04:01.780- 04:07.160* :  It's just a very exciting thing when that capsule opens to see for the first time this material
*04:07.160- 04:12.540* :  that no other human has seen before. It's something you think about, we thought about it for the past
*04:12.580- 04:18.020* :  seven years and it's just going to be very exciting but also there's going to be a lot of work to do
*04:18.020- 04:24.120* :  so we're going to kick into business mode very quickly. There is so much excitement surrounding
*04:24.120- 04:29.280* :  this thing isn't there Jonathan and it's a huge deal for science. I think there are something like
*04:29.280- 04:35.640* :  60,000 meteorites that have been collected from the surface of the earth but all of those 60,000
*04:35.640- 04:40.900* :  meteorites that we have in collections around the world are compromised by virtue of having landed
*04:40.900- 04:45.640* :  on earth and what do I mean by that? Well as they've touched the surface of the earth's water,
*04:45.640- 04:52.260* :  earth's air is starting to get at those rocks and you don't want that. You want a pristine sample
*04:52.260- 04:58.340* :  something that has never touched earth before. Why do you want that? Well we expect in these samples
*04:59.160- 05:04.780* :  there to be clues about the chemistry that went into building the planets. There might even be
*05:04.780- 05:12.060* :  information in these samples which tells us about how life got started and if you speak to the
*05:12.060- 05:18.820* :  likes of Jason Dawkin who's the chief of NASA's astrochemistry laboratory they have very high hopes
*05:18.820- 05:25.300* :  that they've got something really exciting in front of them. Being in science means you gaze to
*05:25.300- 05:31.900* :  the wonder of the universe and being surprised by by what nature has to tell you is always a treat.
*05:32.180- 05:36.240* :  Being the first person to discover something and then have the opportunity to tell everyone
*05:36.240- 05:41.760* :  all about it is what science is about. The thing about all of this is your impatient and this
*05:41.760- 05:47.860* :  work takes a while but we will get a little insight on the 11th of October because NASA is
*05:47.860- 05:54.120* :  promising to hold an international press conference where they will give us a quick look. They'll tell
*05:54.120- 06:00.280* :  us how much material they've got. It's probably around about 250 grams. It doesn't sound like a lot.
*06:00.300- 06:07.780* :  It's about the weight of a large hamster I'm told, an adult hamster. And then over the next two years
*06:07.780- 06:13.440* :  all of those scientists that we were talking about the more than 200 worldwide will get down to
*06:13.440- 06:19.320* :  the serious work and in a couple of years they'll come back together and say yeah this is what we
*06:19.320- 06:25.500* :  got isn't it exciting. That was Jonathan Amos our science correspondent and our thanks to him for
*06:25.500- 06:31.560* :  using adult hamster as a unit of measurement. Now to massive footballing excitement in East Africa.
*06:32.140- 06:36.940* :  For decades the cup of nations has been dominated by the footballing powerhouses in the north
*06:36.940- 06:43.080* :  and west of the continent but the 2027 tournament has been awarded to a joint bid from Kenya, Tanzania
*06:43.080- 06:48.620* :  and Uganda. The decision has been greeted with jubilation across the region and to gauge the
*06:48.620- 06:54.120* :  excitement it's created the Happy Pods Nigel Adely has been speaking to BBC Africa's senior sports
*06:54.120- 07:00.180* :  reporter and proud Ugandan Nishat Ladder to get her thoughts after the head of African football
*07:00.180- 07:07.920* :  Patrice Motsepe made the announcement. So the country that Exko has voted for to host the
*07:07.920- 07:20.260* :  Afghan 2027 East. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Well this is huge it's been nearly 50 years, nearly
*07:20.260- 07:26.580* :  half a century since the region hosted an Africa cup of nations. The region's been waiting for this
*07:26.580- 07:33.340* :  moment there are scenes of jubilation all across East Africa in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya when
*07:33.340- 07:38.980* :  the announcement was made it's going to really help the region not just in terms of its football
*07:39.680- 07:43.960* :  but in terms of the economies of each of the country. So this was a really huge announcement.
*07:47.840- 07:53.300* :  It will cost around two billion dollars to host. Do you believe that the money they will make
*07:53.300- 07:58.980* :  as a result of hosting the tournament will will cover that and also maybe support future generations?
*07:59.260- 08:04.620* :  Well that's always the tricky thing isn't it? Do the benefits outweigh the cost? If you look at
*08:04.620- 08:10.780* :  the three countries my country Ugandan for example where I was born tourism is so huge there and if
*08:10.780- 08:16.960* :  you're going to bring in an influx of tourists and influx of fans from across the continent because
*08:17.360- 08:23.940* :  the Africa cup of nations is so huge now the economy will be boosted so much tourism will be huge.
*08:23.940- 08:28.760* :  I'd like to think that the regeneration of the stadium which will have to happen making
*08:28.760- 08:34.100* :  football more attractive for local fans will be something that will last generations.
*08:36.620- 08:40.480* :  There's massive passion for football in East Africa but they can watch the Premier League,
*08:40.480- 08:47.400* :  they can watch Serie A, La Liga every single week. Is this an opportunity to make new heroes to
*08:47.400- 08:52.720* :  make local heroes? Absolutely yeah and if you look at a country like Tanzania for example their
*08:52.720- 08:58.300* :  captain is Umbhwana Samata. Now we might know him from his days at Aston Villa for example but
*08:58.760- 09:04.340* :  he's an iconic figure and when you've got someone like that spearheading your team the other players
*09:04.340- 09:09.640* :  who may be playing the local leagues will look at him and try and emulate him and you want people
*09:09.640- 09:15.140* :  who'll be headline makers and you know this will be a shot window for a lot of these local players.
*09:15.360- 09:21.260* :  These youngsters coming through will be able to really show off their skills great great shot
*09:21.260- 09:26.780* :  window for them. The interest is there I can tell you I've got family in Uganda who follow football
*09:26.780- 09:33.220* :  really closely so there is always an interest in football. The lovely thing about this announcement
*09:33.220- 09:39.900* :  from CAF is that it's given football a big boost but it's given the countries a big boost just
*09:40.440- 09:45.300* :  at the airport in Kenya there's been singing and dancing as they've been waiting for the delegation
*09:45.300- 09:52.200* :  to come back from Cairo that's the level of excitement ahead of this nation's cup so actually
*09:52.200- 09:58.500* :  the football excitement has always been there what this will do is give all three countries a
*09:58.500- 10:05.300* :  morale boost there's so much that's negative in the world and we're going through a cost of living
*10:05.300- 10:11.800* :  crisis we've had covid how fantastic to say we're going to host the Africa Cup of Nations come
*10:11.800- 10:14.680* :  welcome to our countries that's a beautiful thing about this.
*10:15.560- 10:21.320* :  Nisha Adlada and she was speaking to Nigel Adely now we all remember a teacher who went above
*10:21.320- 10:26.800* :  and beyond who made a real effort a real connection hello miss billar and this one is something
*10:26.800- 10:33.700* :  special she is Maria Dominguez a teacher who hitchhikes to school in rural Uruguay and Felipe
*10:33.700- 10:42.420* :  Jambias of BBC Mundo has been speaking to her about that commute more than 200 kilometers each day
*10:43.140- 10:51.320* :  going to the school and coming back one hour 45 one hour 50 each day going and then another
*10:51.320- 10:57.660* :  almost two hours getting back home why is it necessary for her to hitchhike?
*10:57.940- 11:05.520* :  well the thing is she doesn't have a car if she had a car it would be impossible for her
*11:05.520- 11:14.400* :  because gas is very expensive there's no public transport and the only other thing she could do
*11:14.400- 11:23.180* :  is going by motorbike but she says it is a very long trip the road is not in good condition
*11:24.060- 11:32.960* :  and she feels that is not safe for her to go all the way through motorbike but a lot of people
*11:33.760- 11:41.020* :  would be slightly concerned about the dangers of hitchhiking well actually you know Uruguay is a
*11:41.020- 11:50.860* :  very quiet country especially in the countryside and actually drivers are always very concerned
*11:50.940- 12:00.940* :  but in a good way of taking them to the schools or at least to some place near the school to actually
*12:00.940- 12:08.180* :  teach she's making this incredibly arduous journey but at the end of it she's only got two pupils
*12:08.180- 12:19.020* :  yeah that's true two pupils as you say Juliana who is four years old and Benjamin who is nine years old
*12:19.020- 12:26.000* :  and the thing is that she has to give the lessons to both at the same time and well the thing is
*12:26.000- 12:33.480* :  in Uruguay if there are students the school will open and teachers will go so her pupils obviously
*12:33.480- 12:39.740* :  are quite small do they appreciate her do they understand what sort of effort that she's making
*12:39.740- 12:48.640* :  for them presumably their parents do yeah I'm not sure if they are aware of the effort she makes
*12:48.640- 12:58.120* :  but they do appreciate the kindness of Maria they have almost called her mom sometimes you know
*12:58.940- 13:07.440* :  so yeah it's a very very close relationship Felipe Jambias of BBC Mondo now a few of the other stories
*13:07.440- 13:12.440* :  that caught our attention this week there was a report suggesting that anti-aging drugs could
*13:12.440- 13:17.760* :  make more organs viable for transplants when an organ from an older donor is transplanted into a
*13:17.760- 13:22.440* :  younger person the older cells can release chemicals that cause problems but tests in mice
*13:22.440- 13:28.820* :  succeeded in heading that off using senolytics a new class of drugs that selectively clear away
*13:28.820- 13:36.320* :  senescent cells it is just mice but it is very promising some wedding magic and a lucky bride and
*13:36.320- 13:42.560* :  groom who got a stunning backdrop of the northern lights for their wedding photos Rebecca Mcdonald and
*13:42.560- 13:48.240* :  Chris Orham from Inverness in Scotland were rushed outside to get pictures taken in front of the
*13:48.240- 13:54.360* :  Aurora Borealis wedding photographer Michael Carvey had wanted to capture such a shot for the last
*13:54.360- 14:00.360* :  10 years but he said the stars had never aligned until Monday night congratulations to everyone
*14:00.360- 14:05.600* :  involved and of course I will share that picture on far too many social media platforms with the
*14:05.600- 14:12.920* :  hashtag the happy pod and staying with matters of love it seems that male palm cockatoos make custom
*14:12.920- 14:19.220* :  drumsticks to woo potential mates they have individual preferences for the type of drumstick they want
*14:19.220- 14:25.640* :  and they whittle down branches with their beaks the use of a hard stick or seed pod to tap the tree
*14:25.640- 14:30.460* :  produces louder more impressive sounds than those using the foot alone
*14:36.420- 14:42.100* :  still to calm in this podcast you have that that looks like a sort of crazy neurotic desperate to
*14:42.380- 14:48.760* :  work kind of mentality to really do the job properly the qualities needed on seagull patrol
*14:58.500- 15:03.780* :  I'm Dr. Laurie Santos host of the happiness lab podcast it's never too late or too early to
*15:03.780- 15:08.580* :  learn how to feel happier so my new season has well-being tips for you whether you're aged three
*15:08.580- 15:13.500* :  or a hundred and six like me did I mention I have some amazing co-hosts for this season
*15:13.620- 15:18.580* :  and do not forget cute and fry how could I grover I'll be joined by my fabulous friends
*15:18.580- 15:25.040* :  from Sesame Street that's us all we're watching very very friends be sure to listen wherever you get
*15:25.040- 15:37.360* :  your podcast oh I am so excited this is going to be so magical suddenly my quilt is ripped off me
*15:37.460- 15:42.340* :  and my room is full of white men and I thought I'm done for these are fascists they found where I live
*15:42.540- 15:48.120* :  life's less ordinary is the podcast from the BBC World Service bringing you extraordinary personal
*15:48.120- 15:53.820* :  stories from around the globe betrayal is run through my life and run through my story I was just
*15:53.820- 16:00.460* :  all alone in this vast broken system I never gave up my dream search for lives less ordinary
*16:00.460- 16:10.540* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts to describe hope happiness and optimism you need truly joyous
*16:10.540- 16:15.980* :  words and if you listen to the global news pod regularly and why wouldn't you you might have
*16:15.980- 16:21.200* :  heard mention of the lexographer Susie Dent and her new children's book Roots of Happiness a hundred
*16:21.200- 16:27.660* :  words of hope and joy but happy words come in more flavours than just English and we were hoping
*16:27.660- 16:33.600* :  that you could let us know some of yours so for an idea of what we mean we got Susie back and she
*16:33.600- 16:40.740* :  started with explaining why collecting uplifting words was such a good idea I wrote it because I
*16:40.740- 16:47.020* :  spend so much time writing through the pages of the dictionary and noticing there are so many more
*16:47.020- 16:53.980* :  words for being ugly for example rather than beautiful or cold or hungry the sad side of life I
*16:53.980- 16:59.020* :  suppose and there are really beautiful joyful words in the dictionary but they tend to be just
*16:59.020- 17:03.320* :  sort of consigned to the corners and we don't tend to pick them up and use them so I thought
*17:03.320- 17:07.860* :  wouldn't it be wonderful actually to resurrect some of these and reclaim the lost positives and of
*17:07.860- 17:13.980* :  course the beauty of English is its embraced words from lots of different languages and you've
*17:13.980- 17:19.100* :  actually picked out some contributions for your book from places like Japan and Turkey and
*17:19.100- 17:25.360* :  Portugal and Sweden yes I'm just looking at the page for lagam actually which is Swedish and
*17:25.400- 17:31.780* :  that's just gorgeous it essentially means that not too much not too little but just right which I
*17:31.780- 17:37.120* :  think is gorgeous and I mean lots and lots of words from other languages that we haven't yet managed
*17:37.120- 17:41.960* :  to translate and as you say many of them are in the dictionary one that didn't make it actually
*17:42.380- 17:46.900* :  but which I absolutely love is the Japanese again it's another sort of aesthetic really it's
*17:46.900- 17:54.000* :  Simui which is all about unobtrusive beauty so it's a face that's wrinkled through smiles it's just
*17:54.000- 18:01.120* :  such a lovely idea and then a lot of cultures also have words for being alone in a wood and feeling
*18:01.120- 18:07.660* :  the power of the trees and the the beauty of solitude so German have wild eyes on tight and in
*18:07.660- 18:14.700* :  Japanese again they have say Jacque my pronunciation is terrible to all listeners in Japan but they
*18:14.700- 18:20.520* :  are just not rendered in English so I think we have to go then to the original you've got a lot of
*18:20.520- 18:27.940* :  words that don't just mean something joyous but which sound pleasingly fun are nice to say exactly
*18:27.960- 18:33.640* :  and some of them have silly stories behind them or beautiful stories so fizzle is always a fun one
*18:33.840- 18:38.300* :  as you say there's some recognizable ones in there like Lullaby it's just such a beautiful word
*18:38.300- 18:45.400* :  and one of my absolute favorites is Dadal Dhamdu and a Dadal Dhamdu is somebody who just lives in
*18:45.400- 18:49.920* :  their head you can imagine them just sort of strolling down a lane in the summer just sort of
*18:49.920- 18:55.080* :  humming them that um that um to themselves and I just it's just so beautiful express to Dadal Dhamdu
*18:55.340- 19:01.080* :  I can't let fizzle go without asking you to explain well I wasn't sure whether to go that
*19:01.580- 19:07.440* :  so to fizzle it just always makes children laugh this one because actually whatever you call
*19:07.980- 19:12.660* :  breaking wind should we say politely it actually crops up in so many words that you might not
*19:12.660- 19:16.420* :  expect in English and fizzle is one of them because the very first meaning of it was to break
*19:16.420- 19:21.220* :  wind quietly but yet always makes children smile not just children it must be said
*19:23.200- 19:26.700* :  looking at a lot of these words and some of them are quite old and there are some new words
*19:26.700- 19:32.660* :  as well and we'll come on to those in a moment did you make any up because scurry funge has the
*19:32.660- 19:39.420* :  faintest hint of a word expert making fun of her editor oh no honestly I have been actually
*19:39.420- 19:44.120* :  talking about scurry funging for such a long time ever since I discovered it it's just so pithy
*19:44.200- 19:50.460* :  so to scurry funge is to dash about the house madly frenetically tiding up because guests are
*19:50.460- 19:55.400* :  about to arrive but no sadly I would love to have invented that one but I'm not clever enough of that
*19:56.040- 20:01.920* :  you do go back several hundred years for some of the words in this book but you aren't snobbish
*20:01.920- 20:08.060* :  about adopting new ones like bestie and emoji when our character limit is there and there's
*20:08.060- 20:13.000* :  pressure to sort of express something quite succinctly or indeed because we're speaking with our
*20:13.000- 20:19.160* :  fingers and tapping away our conversations on our screens we've all fallen foul in situations where
*20:19.160- 20:24.620* :  actually just a little smiley face would have helped the the recipient not you know interpret it
*20:24.620- 20:28.980* :  in the wrong way so emoji definitely have their uses and I put that one in I've also put
*20:28.980- 20:35.280* :  amazeballs in as in totes amazeballs which I totally get is very silly but it's just an
*20:35.280- 20:42.220* :  example of how we are so playful with language that was Susie Dent whose book roots of happiness a
*20:42.220- 20:47.280* :  hundred words of hope and joy with very beautiful illustrations by Harriet Hobday is out shortly
*20:47.720- 20:53.120* :  and inspired by Susie please share with us the beautiful and amusing words you have for happy
*20:53.120- 21:00.480* :  things in your language region or dialect the usual email address global podcast at bbc.co.uk
*21:00.480- 21:06.700* :  and we'll be very gruntled indeed now it isn't often that serious scientists celebrate coming up
*21:06.700- 21:13.020* :  with what just might be the holy grail in their field but a team at Queen Margaret University
*21:13.020- 21:18.360* :  and Scotland are getting pretty excited about developing a healthier and more sustainable alternative
*21:18.360- 21:25.180* :  to palm oil palm oil production is a key driver of deforestation and habitat destruction in places
*21:25.180- 21:31.080* :  like Malaysia and Indonesia but it's very widely used in the food industry and beyond as Katrina
*21:31.080- 21:36.720* :  little the head of the Scottish Centre for food development and innovation explained is incredibly
*21:36.720- 21:42.260* :  functional so it works for all sorts of benefits it helps texture and cake it proves shelf life
*21:42.260- 21:48.500* :  is a bland fact that makes things taste great so it's rather shame that it's incredibly bad for you
*21:48.500- 21:52.400* :  and it's incredibly bad for the environment as well so where we've looked at our product we've
*21:52.400- 21:58.040* :  looked at replacing it completely and make this and does it do all of the things that we've come
*21:58.040- 22:04.040* :  to rely on palm oil for in broad terms palm together with a lot of saturated fats it's solid
*22:04.040- 22:10.860* :  at room temperature and what we've done is we've tried to mimic that by mixing some oil some
*22:10.860- 22:15.960* :  fibers and proteins our products more of a semi-solid if it's a bit like mayonnaise but it works
*22:15.960- 22:20.300* :  very well in the applications we've looked at a lot of different applications with cake biscuits
*22:20.680- 22:26.040* :  bread and we've been able to make a hundred percent replacement we put it through a special sensory
*22:26.040- 22:30.260* :  panel and they couldn't ascertain a difference between the two products so we think that's
*22:30.340- 22:35.560* :  pretty good so far it's obviously not going to replace every usage of palm oil and this is just
*22:35.560- 22:41.100* :  the first stage so the people on your panel who were tasting couldn't taste the difference
*22:41.600- 22:46.520* :  but I understand this is actually healthier as well is that right so what we've tried to do is we've
*22:46.520- 22:52.900* :  got a reduction around 30% in calories the fat and over 80% reduction is actually the fat so when
*22:52.900- 22:57.120* :  you're looking at a product range which is quite unhealthy in the first place like bakery what we've
*22:57.120- 23:04.120* :  tried to do is make that a lot healthier so are manufacturers already interested in your product
*23:04.120- 23:09.880* :  is it something that you can see coming on to the market at some point soon well we did our first
*23:09.880- 23:15.920* :  broadcast on this and we were just inundated it's just been quite a staggering difference from
*23:16.260- 23:19.780* :  across industry not just the food industry from manufacturers looking to this and it's global
*23:19.780- 23:24.540* :  because it's such a global ingredient myself and the other co-creator Dr Julie Jean
*23:24.800- 23:29.780* :  launch on we are not looking to manufacture ourselves we're looking for a company to come into
*23:29.780- 23:34.740* :  this for us so that's where we're looking at manufacturing facilities so hopefully relatively soon
*23:35.240- 23:39.360* :  we'll be able to offer this out at what point did you let yourselves get excited about this
*23:40.760- 23:44.720* :  I mean we started this just to is it possible I mean just thought how hard can it be
*23:45.780- 23:49.620* :  there was a bit like that but then we discovered how hard it was and so we've been looking at this
*23:49.620- 23:54.520* :  for four years we thought well this works quite well I mean from our point of view we're delighted
*23:54.520- 23:59.640* :  that we've done it we are techy nerds effectively we like to create things we're probably not
*23:59.980- 24:04.340* :  a typical inventor that we get really excited about each different invention but we are
*24:04.340- 24:08.160* :  pretty pleased with the results in the mainstream we just want to get this used we want to get this
*24:08.160- 24:12.800* :  into the food and show above all we want to try and make some impact and reduce the
*24:12.800- 24:18.260* :  deforestation which is criminal almost we've been told with a bit too humble as well so I don't
*24:18.260- 24:22.800* :  know what to make of that you should never be too humble never be too humble before I let you go
*24:22.940- 24:28.200* :  please let me refer to and congratulate you on the photo on your press release I think you know
*24:28.200- 24:33.620* :  the one I mean there is a man holding up a beaker like it's a precious artifact I'm assuming that
*24:33.620- 24:40.840* :  is your partner and you gazing with reference at the contents of a baking tin that's the one we've
*24:40.840- 24:45.680* :  had lots of comments about a particular picture my favorite is there's Dr. Gillichol what really
*24:45.680- 24:52.220* :  tall or it's Katrina little very small it's my favorite one we didn't know it was going to come
*24:52.220- 24:55.640* :  out that way but this is what we were asked to do by the food companies and make sure
*24:56.000- 24:59.840* :  make sure you're looking at it with with with great interest and you and he kept telling me to
*24:59.840- 25:06.560* :  smell I'm not used to having my fault it Katrina little of the Scottish centre for food development
*25:06.560- 25:07.480* :  and innovation
*25:14.700- 25:20.940* :  the cry of sea goals is a familiar sound along coastlines around the world but so too is the problem
*25:20.940- 25:26.620* :  of the birds swooping down and scavenging for food in Sydney the problem around the harbour
*25:26.620- 25:31.460* :  foreshore became so serious that the restaurants clump together to try to find a solution they
*25:31.460- 25:38.000* :  tried covering the serving platters with wire clashes they blasted out sonic deterrence and even
*25:38.000- 25:45.300* :  installed a robotic hawk but nothing seemed to scare the sea goals away enter James Webb the founder
*25:45.300- 25:51.380* :  of mad dogs and Englishman and his seagull patrol dogs we obviously had to find out more we actually
*25:51.380- 25:57.000* :  train the dogs to target the sea goals and they'll run around they'll jump up on the all their
*25:57.300- 26:00.960* :  bark at the sea goals and scare them away so once the sea goals know the dogs are there they just
*26:00.980- 26:04.600* :  don't chance it and they don't hang around for the day so we realised pretty quickly that you
*26:04.600- 26:08.280* :  can't just have a dog there and wander up and down like with the pet dog over the years we've
*26:08.280- 26:12.600* :  refined it and now we have proper they're all working dogs and these working dogs the board
*26:12.600- 26:16.780* :  colleagues and the kelpies they work really really well so we have to have a working breed of dog
*26:17.100- 26:20.860* :  for example we tried using Labrador's at the beginning because they would chase these seagulls
*26:20.860- 26:24.320* :  around the park we were walking them and and you think oh they'd be great there but then you
*26:24.320- 26:28.480* :  take them down there and they just want the food of the tables or you might bring a spoon all
*26:28.480- 26:32.980* :  down that's crazy for trading birds because it's not a working breed it'll run out of steam up for
*26:32.980- 26:37.980* :  an hour and just go and try and get packs off of everybody so you have to have that working mentality
*26:38.140- 26:43.700* :  in the slightly sort of crazy neurotic desperate to work kind of mentality to really do the job
*26:43.700- 26:52.080* :  properly just looking at the practicalities barking dogs and thieving birds and the conflict between
*26:52.080- 26:57.840* :  these things that doesn't actually sound terribly restful and how do people feel about it the general
*26:57.840- 27:01.640* :  public absolutely love it people are always listening and people will comment as you're walking
*27:01.640- 27:05.080* :  up and down you get around the floor so every time the dog's done and especially impressive
*27:05.300- 27:08.940* :  run towards the seagulls and scaring them away just before it's about to get some food so they're
*27:08.940- 27:12.720* :  working really well on the dogs level of that too all of the dogs are very popular and they're all
*27:12.720- 27:16.660* :  got their own little characters and people prefer different dogs and they'll they'll know their names
*27:16.660- 27:19.580* :  when they come down I'll be walking down there with the dog and they're like oh that's Sydney that's
*27:19.580- 27:24.440* :  Tilly that's Gigi and so on so they know all of the dogs names and you say that they they aren't
*27:24.440- 27:29.880* :  just working dogs they're having fun they're enjoying this dogs only work one day a week in its
*27:29.880- 27:34.840* :  four hours like I never let the dogs work more than four hours so we don't overwork the dogs
*27:34.840- 27:40.200* :  so the dogs always enjoy it and that's the key I think so the dogs love it yeah when you arrived
*27:40.200- 27:46.720* :  in Australia did you envisage this being your career path and are you delighted with it oh yeah
*27:46.720- 27:51.360* :  I love it I couldn't predict it because no one else is doing this sort of happened just by enjoying
*27:51.360- 27:55.280* :  what I'm doing and you know rather than going for the money I'm doing something I enjoy and I think
*27:56.000- 27:59.900* :  success has sort of come from that James Webb talking to us from Sydney Australia
*28:04.400- 28:09.080* :  and that's it from us for now remember if you would like to be part of the happy pod send us sounds
*28:09.080- 28:14.240* :  that make you smile and indeed your regional words of hope and joy the email address global
