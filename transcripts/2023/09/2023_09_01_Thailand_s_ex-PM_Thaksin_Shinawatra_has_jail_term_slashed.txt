01:35.000 - 01:38.240:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:40.600 - 01:44.880:  I'm Rachel Wright and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 1st of September,
01:44.880 - 01:46.600:  these are our main stories.
01:47.160 - 01:49.800:  Tax in Chinawatt, Thailand's former Prime Minister,
01:49.800 - 01:52.920:  jailed for corruption has had his sentence massively reduced.
01:53.620 - 01:56.840:  Hong Kong buttons down the hatches as Typhoon Sour approaches.
01:57.600 - 02:01.560:  I'm very worried because this typhoon is a super typhoon.
02:01.760 - 02:05.320:  We can see that the eye of the typhoon will pass very close to Hong Kong.
02:05.800 - 02:10.020:  And how the human race nearly got wiped out 900,000 years ago.
02:13.120 - 02:14.260:  Also in this podcast.
02:14.620 - 02:15.220:  What's going on?
02:16.540 - 02:17.560:  What's going on?
02:28.820 - 02:31.440:  He only just returned from exile days ago.
02:31.700 - 02:33.520:  Now, Thailand's former Prime Minister,
02:33.520 - 02:38.240:  Tax in Chinawatt, has had his eight-year jail term slashed to one year.
02:38.760 - 02:43.480:  The country's most famous politician spent 15 years in self-imposed exile
02:43.960 - 02:45.720:  before returning home to face jail.
02:46.300 - 02:49.200:  He'd been convicted of abuse of power and corruption.
02:49.760 - 02:53.160:  Mr. Taxin appealed for a royal pardon only yesterday,
02:53.740 - 02:55.280:  so has a deal been struck?
02:55.280 - 03:00.160:  A question for our South East Asia correspondent, Jonathan Head, who's in Thailand.
03:00.920 - 03:03.420:  I think it probably does, although no one's going to admit that.
03:03.680 - 03:07.480:  You know, he wouldn't have come back if he hadn't negotiated a deal beforehand.
03:07.480 - 03:10.980:  He might well have hoped possibly for a complete pardon.
03:11.020 - 03:16.360:  This arrangement, I think, is a very appropriate compromise.
03:16.580 - 03:19.340:  There are many people still very critical of Mr. Taxin,
03:19.740 - 03:22.060:  who feel that he genuinely did abuse his power.
03:22.060 - 03:26.160:  He said in the past that these convictions were politically motivated.
03:26.160 - 03:30.200:  Of course, he was ousted by coup, and the convictions were imposed in his absence.
03:30.880 - 03:32.580:  But many people feel he did do a lot wrong.
03:32.580 - 03:36.600:  And so I think the King has probably chosen a sort of middle ground here.
03:36.840 - 03:39.820:  There has to be a deal not just to get Mr. Taxin back,
03:39.820 - 03:42.880:  but the real point of this deal is to get his party,
03:42.880 - 03:46.700:  which is still a very big one, and in the past used to win elections all the time,
03:47.340 - 03:50.140:  in a reconciliation with its conservative opponents.
03:50.280 - 03:53.420:  This conflict has dominated Thailand for 20 years,
03:54.040 - 03:58.080:  and I think it's in both Mr. Taxin's interests and the interests of conservatives
03:58.660 - 04:02.580:  that they bury the hatchet, and that that was what we understood the deal to be about,
04:02.580 - 04:07.180:  and always leniency for Mr. Taxin was an inevitable part of that.
04:07.500 - 04:10.080:  But he is, I understand, in the prison hospital.
04:10.080 - 04:12.140:  He's not very well. He's quite old.
04:13.060 - 04:16.260:  Is he likely to be able to re-enter the political stage?
04:16.900 - 04:18.660:  Well, nobody knows just how unwell he is.
04:18.660 - 04:20.520:  He's clearly got some issues. He's 74.
04:20.520 - 04:24.200:  I don't think he certainly didn't look very well when he first arrived back.
04:24.820 - 04:27.140:  He's in a police hospital. They say it's a police hospital.
04:27.140 - 04:31.080:  It's actually a state hospital on the 14th floor, the premium wing.
04:31.080 - 04:32.620:  I don't think he's in any discomfort.
04:33.220 - 04:37.200:  I'm sure all of this was part and parcel of the arrangements that were made with him.
04:37.660 - 04:42.980:  And although he has a year still to serve, with parole, he could in theory be eligible
04:42.980 - 04:44.500:  for release after four months.
04:44.540 - 04:50.180:  So he doesn't have long to wait, and he is still the most influential person in his party.
04:50.740 - 04:53.340:  His problem is going to be that in order to execute this deal,
04:53.340 - 04:56.980:  his party has gotten to bed with its former enemies,
04:56.980 - 04:59.900:  with people it swore never to cooperate with in government.
04:59.900 - 05:02.760:  People who, you know, there are a lot of grievances against them.
05:03.100 - 05:04.640:  It's a very messy coalition government.
05:04.640 - 05:06.160:  Lots of parties, lots of interests.
05:06.160 - 05:11.300:  A very high expectations from the public that they will perform and do miracles with the economy
05:11.920 - 05:14.000:  after the front leading party.
05:14.040 - 05:16.280:  The party that actually did got the most seats in the election,
05:16.280 - 05:18.620:  which is a reformers party, was barred from office.
05:18.940 - 05:22.740:  So there's a big hill to climb for Mr Tex and his party to recover both legitimacy
05:22.740 - 05:26.200:  and to be able to perform in not very favourable political conditions.
05:26.220 - 05:31.640:  Jonathan Head, Typhoon Sourler, has been slamming into Hong Kong with
05:31.860 - 05:36.660:  whether forecasters predicting that this could be the biggest storm in the region since 1949.
05:37.420 - 05:40.480:  Schools, businesses, and financial markets have been closed.
05:40.480 - 05:45.100:  Hundreds of flights cancelled as people sheltered inside away from the storm.
05:45.600 - 05:47.620:  This local woman explained her concern.
05:49.860 - 05:54.440:  I'm very worried because the news and the Hong Kong Observatory have both reported that this
05:54.440 - 05:56.160:  Typhoon is a super Typhoon.
05:56.700 - 05:59.580:  Moreover, after seeing the Typhoon's path map online,
06:00.020 - 06:03.620:  we can see that the eye of the Typhoon will pass very close to Hong Kong.
06:04.360 - 06:07.300:  So I'm a bit concerned and hope it won't cause too many casualties.
06:07.940 - 06:10.280:  Our reporter Martin Ye, Piz in Hong Kong.
06:10.980 - 06:16.660:  Well, right outside of my window at this very moment, I'm seeing I feel palm trees being
06:16.660 - 06:23.480:  blown pretty hard. I'm not sure if they will be able to hold on for any time longer,
06:23.660 - 06:28.120:  but they're still standing, but you can see the gust blowing through with
06:29.040 - 06:36.860:  increasing the heavy rain is now coming close to the stage that you can say is throwing cats and
06:36.860 - 06:39.700:  dogs in the sky. It's really strong out there.
06:40.460 - 06:46.520:  Well, I just read from the Hong Kong Observatory, that's the meteorological agency in Hong Kong.
06:46.520 - 06:54.560:  They are saying that gusts up to 154 kilometers per hour after that speed has already been recorded,
06:54.560 - 06:56.580:  so this is definitely something.
06:57.300 - 07:02.200:  And it's obviously a big storm, as you say. What kind of damage are the authorities expecting?
07:02.240 - 07:04.160:  And what kind of preparations have they made?
07:05.280 - 07:12.260:  Well, fallen trees would be the biggest concern because last time in 2018, when Typhoon
07:12.620 - 07:19.520:  hit Hong Kong, that one brought Hong Kong with no fatalities, that's the upside, but then
07:19.940 - 07:25.100:  loads of trees, tens of thousands of them were fallen, some blocks major through fast,
07:25.100 - 07:30.920:  and even railways, and ended up Hong Kong with quite a travel chaos in the coming hours,
07:30.920 - 07:37.400:  if not days. So the government has been saying that they have allocated extra manpower and
07:37.400 - 07:43.820:  location to clear up and store any fallen trees to make sure once Typhoon is gone,
07:43.820 - 07:47.940:  the city could get back to normality as soon as possible.
07:48.320 - 07:50.740:  And very briefly, how frequent are these storms?
07:51.540 - 07:55.980:  Storms in Hong Kong is not red. Typhoon hits Hong Kong virtually every year,
07:56.020 - 08:01.280:  but not for something getting this strong. And now we are having the signal number
08:02.020 - 08:06.880:  nine at the moment, that's the second highest, if that goes up to number 10, that would put it
08:06.880 - 08:15.340:  at par with American hurricane. And signal number 10 has only been issued for 16 times since World
08:15.340 - 08:22.080:  War II, so you can tell how red it is for Hong Kong. Martin Yip, and since we spoke to Martin,
08:22.080 - 08:28.780:  the authorities have indeed upgraded the storm to signal 10. Around 900,000 years ago,
08:28.780 - 08:34.840:  the human race hit a bottleneck, and our ancestors nearly became extinct. The population dropped
08:34.840 - 08:41.600:  through about 1,300 people, these days that would be just about the size of a village. So what
08:41.600 - 08:46.980:  threatened our existence and how did we overcome it? The newsroom's Lippaker Palem has been
08:46.980 - 08:54.400:  finding out more. From prehistory to our time, from folklore to doomsday clock, the earth has
08:54.400 - 09:00.640:  hit calamitous events which threaten the human race. But scientists have now identified a period
09:00.640 - 09:07.380:  of maximum danger when our very existence flickered on the brink of extinction. Researchers in China
09:07.380 - 09:13.820:  have determined that the worldwide human breeding population fell to only about 1,300 people,
09:14.420 - 09:20.960:  and it stayed at this perilously low level for a hundred thousand years. The scientists have
09:20.960 - 09:27.420:  developed a unique method which can analyse modern genetic data to estimate past population size.
09:28.160 - 09:36.940:  They analysed the DNA of 3,154 modern humans from both African and non-African populations and
09:36.940 - 09:43.640:  found that nearly 99% of our ancestral population was lost at the start of this bottleneck.
09:44.340 - 09:49.860:  The decline may have coincided with climate change, leading to long periods of glaciation,
09:49.860 - 09:56.440:  a drop in sea surface temperature, long periods of drought, and a loss of other species which may
09:56.440 - 10:02.220:  have been a food source. The collected data suggests that the bottleneck may have led to increased
10:02.220 - 10:08.440:  inbreeding and a loss in human genetic diversity. The scientists said their findings have developed a
10:08.440 - 10:15.780:  new field in human evolution, posing questions about just where these 1,300 individuals lived,
10:16.120 - 10:21.220:  how they overcame catastrophic environmental changes, and whether natural selection during the
10:21.220 - 10:26.740:  bottleneck led to the evolution of the human brain as it is today. Lippaker Pellum
10:27.760 - 10:33.820:  A video posted by a Moroccan fisherman on social media of the body of a holiday maker floating
10:33.820 - 10:39.860:  in the Mediterranean has triggered an intense reaction among many Moroccans. The victim has been
10:39.860 - 10:45.260:  identified as one of two French Moroccan dual nationals who were shot dead by Algerian
10:45.260 - 10:49.920:  coast guards after they lost their way after setting off on their jet skis from the Moroccan
10:49.920 - 10:55.680:  resort of Saidia. I got some more about this from our Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton.
10:56.580 - 11:02.740:  One of the survivors, Muhammad, said he and his brother and two friends went jet skiing off the
11:02.740 - 11:10.280:  coast. They got lost, they ran out of fuel, and they straight into Algerian territory. He said
11:10.280 - 11:17.040:  they were approached by a black rubber dinghy with Algerian coast guards on board who shot to them dead.
11:17.040 - 11:24.040:  Muhammad said he swam back towards Saidia, he got picked up by a Moroccan navy patrol boat,
11:24.040 - 11:29.840:  but he said that one of the four people is currently in jail in Algeria. If you look at the map,
11:29.840 - 11:35.660:  Saidia is right on the edge of the border, but there wouldn't be like a border post in the water,
11:35.660 - 11:41.560:  so it'd be quite easy to get lost or to stray across. And jet skiing is actually very popular
11:41.560 - 11:48.840:  amongst Moroccan, certainly richer people. And the king, Muhammad VI, is a great jet skier and
11:48.840 - 11:54.740:  has even been nicknamed Sam Majetski. What has the reaction been like in Morocco to this?
11:55.200 - 12:00.720:  Well, as you might imagine, there's been a lot of outrage on social media, so one Moroccan man
12:00.720 - 12:07.520:  on Twitter, or X, has said the Algerian military regime is killing our children in cold blood.
12:07.520 - 12:12.940:  The victims were quite young men, they weren't children. Another one says this shows the amount of
12:12.940 - 12:19.020:  hatred from Algeria towards Moroccan people. And the cousin of one of the victims, an actor called
12:19.020 - 12:24.600:  Abdullah Karim Kisi, called on the authorities to bring in the case of the international courts.
12:24.960 - 12:30.360:  And then some Algerians have been retaliating, suggesting that it might have been some drug
12:30.360 - 12:35.660:  trafficking incident, but there's no evidence so far of that. It sounds to me from those reactions
12:35.740 - 12:41.620:  that there is tension, great tension between the two countries. Yeah, it's not an understatement
12:41.620 - 12:47.340:  to say they absolutely hate each other. And it goes back to independence, there was what was called
12:47.340 - 12:54.300:  the Sand War in 1963, a border war between the two countries. Algeria closed the border in 1994,
12:54.300 - 12:59.580:  it's never been reopened. It's mainly to do with the disputed territory of Western Sahara,
13:00.000 - 13:05.540:  and any slight incident can flare up and become a major diplomatic incident.
13:06.200 - 13:12.220:  Richard Hamilton. India's Supreme Court is currently hearing an important case about the
13:12.220 - 13:17.740:  legality of the withdrawal of Indian-administered Kashmir's special status in 2019.
13:17.980 - 13:23.380:  Since the change, which gave the Indian National Government political control of Kashmir,
13:23.800 - 13:28.740:  journalists say the administration has been carrying out a systematic and sinister campaign
13:28.740 - 13:35.240:  of arrests and intimidation aimed at silencing the press in the region. The BBC has spoken to
13:35.240 - 13:40.300:  more than two dozen journalists for this investigation. The Indian government says there is
13:40.300 - 13:46.940:  absolute press freedom in Kashmir. Our South-Eighter correspondent Yoghita Lamay reports from Shinagar.
13:47.920 - 13:52.640:  At least eight journalists in Indian-administered Kashmir have been jailed in the past few years,
13:53.160 - 13:56.640:  and we're seeing the frequency of this kind of action against the press,
13:57.260 - 14:03.440:  increasing in the last 18 months. Some have got bail. Four are still in jail.
14:04.160 - 14:09.020:  I'm in Surinagar, the capital of the region, and I've come to the home of one of those journalists
14:09.020 - 14:16.860:  who still in custody, Asif Sultan. He was jailed in 2018. Last year, he was granted bail,
14:16.860 - 14:23.380:  but before he was released from custody, a second set of charges under draconian terror laws
14:23.400 - 14:27.240:  was brought against him by the police, and he wasn't set free.
14:29.960 - 14:34.280:  Asif is charged under terrorism law, accused of aiding militancy,
14:34.540 - 14:39.300:  but his father, Mohamed Sultan, says he's been targeted for his work.
14:40.220 - 14:45.300:  Arrested soon after he wrote an article analyzing why the killing of one armed
14:45.300 - 14:51.180:  insurgent by Indian security forces in 2016 had triggered unrest for years.
14:53.180 - 14:56.860:  Everyone knows he's innocent. He's a professional reporter,
14:57.440 - 15:02.400:  and was jailed for his writing about the militancy. They wanted to make an example out of him.
15:02.960 - 15:07.580:  There are more such cases. Last year, journalist Sajad Gul was jailed,
15:07.760 - 15:14.040:  accused of criminal conspiracy. A month after him, well-known magazine editor Fahad Shah was arrested
15:14.040 - 15:19.840:  on terrorism charges. We've spoken to more than two dozen journalists who've told us they see the
15:19.840 - 15:25.360:  arrests as a warning. They told us about the intimidation they faced. We're hiding their
15:25.360 - 15:30.560:  identities to protect them. I started getting calls from the police over a story I had written.
15:30.560 - 15:36.040:  They kept asking why I had done it. Then I was questioned in person. They told me they know
15:36.040 - 15:42.420:  everything about me and my family, which felt very scary. Has that in any way at the moment impacted
15:43.240 - 15:46.820:  the journalism that you're doing or the reporting that you're doing? Instead of thinking about
15:46.820 - 15:51.600:  whether I have enough facts in a report, I worry more about whether it will land me in trouble.
15:52.000 - 15:55.500:  There is an attempt to silence the press in Kashmir once and for all.
15:55.840 - 16:01.120:  Each one of the journalists that we spoke to told us they've been summoned at least once.
16:01.120 - 16:06.920:  Many of them, multiple times by the police, over stories or social media posts,
16:06.920 - 16:11.380:  seen as being critical of the state. Dozens of journalists have had their passport
16:11.380 - 16:17.860:  renewal applications stopped? Others are on no-fly lists prevented from leaving the country
16:18.300 - 16:24.920:  and the impact is actually evident when you look at the day's newspapers. What I've also got
16:24.920 - 16:33.400:  on my phone is the press release which came from the administration yesterday. That is one of the
16:33.400 - 16:40.160:  stories on the front pages of pretty much every newspaper that I'm looking at. The rest of the
16:40.160 - 16:45.240:  front pages also covered with statements from either the national government or other arms of
16:45.240 - 16:50.140:  the administration. I've looked through them, there are some soft stories, but there's barely any
16:50.140 - 16:54.640:  journalism in there holding the government to account. We've been speaking to magazine and
16:54.640 - 17:00.320:  newspaper editors who've told us that they often get directives from the government on what story
17:00.320 - 17:07.220:  to run, what not to run, and sometimes even where it should be placed in the paper. The police
17:07.220 - 17:12.420:  and the state administration didn't agree to be interviewed for our report. We send them specific
17:12.420 - 17:17.980:  questions asking about the allegations made by the journalists we spoke to. They've not responded.
17:18.500 - 17:23.080:  In press statements, the administrative head of the region has insisted there's absolute press
17:23.080 - 17:27.900:  freedom in Kashmir and journalists who are jailed have not been arrested for their writing.
17:28.780 - 17:38.180:  Dugu Salamai. Still to come in this podcast. We're using pressurized air to apply forces to the
17:38.180 - 17:43.680:  body from within the fabric materials from which we're composing these wearables and garments.
17:43.680 - 17:50.000:  And so it feels like a gentle push on the body. How hidden technology could change our relationship
17:50.000 - 18:01.620:  with clothes? The road to success seems quick. My first try to go to Olympic Games was in 1980.
18:01.640 - 18:06.820:  Everybody's been seeing me run for years growing up. Get to know the people behind the medals
18:06.820 - 18:13.120:  as Olympians and Paralympians share their stories. My story can help so many other victims and
18:13.120 - 18:18.500:  survivors. On the podium from the BBC World Service. The journey in the ups and downs.

19:01.320 - 19:07.480:  rich? Our podcast Good Bad billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how
19:07.480 - 19:12.180:  they made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
19:12.180 - 19:15.700:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims,
19:16.000 - 19:20.700:  or what Jeff Bezos really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred

19:33.940 - 19:39.540:  In Russia, anyone who publicly criticises the so-called special military operation in Ukraine
19:39.540 - 19:46.480:  faces severe punishment unless that is they are so-called Z bloggers, commentators with big online
19:46.480 - 19:51.860:  followings who report from the front line. These nationalists are seemingly able to condemn
19:51.860 - 19:57.520:  the Russian military over its tactics and escape punishment. In fact, some are making lots of
19:57.520 - 20:05.840:  money from advertising between $400 and $1,900 per post. My colleague Oliver Conway heard more from
20:05.840 - 20:12.860:  Grigor Atonizian of the BBC's disinformation unit. The Z bloggers post constant updates from
20:12.860 - 20:18.680:  the front lines in Ukraine and they try to make the war popular among younger audiences in Russia
20:18.760 - 20:24.940:  and to make man go and enlist in the army. But at the same time, they also profit from the war
20:24.940 - 20:30.380:  because they now have hundreds of thousands of subscribers on Telegram, the main social
20:30.380 - 20:35.180:  media platform in Russia after the ban of western platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
20:35.660 - 20:41.020:  And they use those audiences to sell ads for anything from, you know, cryptocurrency to fashion.
20:41.020 - 20:46.540:  A lot of them do post at least one at per day. This is a part of our original investigation we
20:46.540 - 20:51.660:  post as hotel owners and try to place ads in their channels and we found out that the top
20:51.660 - 20:58.860:  bloggers make fantastic money especially for Russia. And they are on the front line filming and
20:59.100 - 21:04.400:  commenting on what's happening. That's right, they're bold brush and funny and they try to make
21:04.400 - 21:09.720:  the war binge warfare relatable to the younger audiences very different from the traditional TV
21:09.720 - 21:15.300:  propaganda that Putin has relied on throughout his reign. And I think what we are seeing now throughout
21:15.300 - 21:20.060:  this invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin knows that there are these people who are very, very popular
21:20.060 - 21:26.340:  online and they try to catch up on that. And I think a big sign of that was in June when Putin
21:26.340 - 21:32.780:  invited a lot of those bloggers into the Kremlin and he had like a huge two hour long conversation
21:32.780 - 21:38.140:  with them on the record. And they will allow to ask him very inconvenient questions about Russian
21:38.140 - 21:43.980:  setbacks and failures, but he asked them for a favor. He said literally and I am quoting the
21:43.980 - 21:48.620:  fight in the information space is a crucial battlefield in a really count on your help.
21:49.060 - 21:53.520:  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because they are quite critical and very influential. They even
21:53.520 - 21:59.060:  led to some changes within the military structure because of their demands. But at the same time,
21:59.060 - 22:02.960:  there seems to be something of a crackdown on them, at least from the authorities at the moment.
22:03.660 - 22:08.180:  No, you're absolutely right. They do tell a lot of those incoming troops about the Russian
22:08.180 - 22:14.140:  military in Ukraine. That's why we and other Western media independent experts follow them quite
22:14.140 - 22:20.100:  often side them and quote in our pieces, but they also do sometime overstep. Specifically,
22:20.100 - 22:25.960:  when they criticize Putin directly, we've seen with Igor Gyrkin known as Telkov as well a
22:25.960 - 22:31.800:  former field commander of the pro-Russian forces, you know, occupied Ukraine. He dared to criticize
22:31.800 - 22:37.500:  Putin directly. And then on the same day, the FSB launched a criminal investigation and he was
22:37.500 - 22:43.220:  arrested soon. So they have to try to find line. Are there also Ukrainian military bloggers?
22:43.540 - 22:48.380:  There are military bloggers in Ukraine. They also go to the front lines. They also very brave
22:49.340 - 22:53.280:  reporting from those front lines, but it's a completely different ecosystem in Ukraine,
22:53.880 - 22:59.560:  because they're just a part of a thriving democracy, even if they have wartime limitations on
22:59.560 - 23:05.000:  speech. In Russia, you know, thousands and thousands of people have been prosecuted for online
23:05.000 - 23:09.720:  post-criticizing the war. You know, we know that families have been separated, kids were orphaned
23:09.720 - 23:15.360:  because their parents dared to say no to war. And then these people with their millions of
23:15.360 - 23:19.700:  followers, they say, you know, generals are corrupt and incompetent and they get away with that.
23:20.220 - 23:25.180:  But there will be a point, I think, at which the Kremlin would look at pros and cons of having
23:25.180 - 23:32.360:  this voices. Grigor Atenasian. Ecuador has long been known as one of the most peaceful countries in
23:32.360 - 23:38.460:  Latin America, but a soaring murder rate driven by drug trafficking gangs has turned it into one
23:38.460 - 23:43.260:  of the most dangerous. The war against the drug gangs has been centering on the prisons,
23:43.260 - 23:49.460:  where more than 400 inmates have been killed. Many burned alive or beheaded since February
23:49.460 - 23:55.940:  2021. In the latest violence, more than 55 prison guards and police officers have been taken hostage
23:55.940 - 24:02.140:  at several facilities across the country. In the capital Keto, car bombs went off outside the prison
24:08.240 - 24:12.720:  headquarters. Ecuador made headlines across the world back in August when a leading candidate in
24:12.720 - 24:18.420:  the presidential election was murdered at a campaign rally. I spoke to Matthias Zibel from BBC
24:19.640 - 24:25.240:  The situation is still ongoing. The tension is there. It's another proof that the Ecuadorian
24:25.240 - 24:31.320:  government has not the control of the prisons in the last two years. We have to remember that we
24:31.320 - 24:37.380:  are now in the middle of a state of emergency. And these kind of terrible acts are going on,
24:37.380 - 24:42.960:  are still happening in the country. And do we know who is behind the hostage taking?
24:43.600 - 24:49.940:  We know that this started as a protest from the prisons. The leaders of the gangs were against
24:49.940 - 24:55.860:  the transfer of prisoners from one prison to another prison. And they were against these
24:55.860 - 25:01.680:  operatives of confiscation of gangs inside the prisons. They know that the target is
25:02.100 - 25:08.120:  the Penitentiary Service. We have two explosions in the capital city against the headquarters
25:08.120 - 25:14.460:  of the Penitentiary Service. So it's clear that this is a battle between the gangs inside the
25:14.460 - 25:19.840:  prisons and the Penitentiary Service. So how much control do the authorities have over these
25:19.840 - 25:26.940:  prisons? We have been watching this kind of incidents for the last two years, sometimes with
25:26.940 - 25:33.560:  more than a hundred prisoners killed in this kind of mutinities. We have one state of emergency
25:34.040 - 25:40.320:  behind another state of emergency. And nothing seems to work. And nothing seems to show that the
25:40.320 - 25:46.620:  government has the control of the prisons. Ecuador used to be one of the most peaceful countries
25:46.620 - 25:53.580:  Latin America. What's happened? We have to remember that Ecuador is placed in the middle of Colombia
25:53.580 - 26:01.520:  and Peru, the most important cocaine producers in the world. In the past, the drugs just go
26:01.520 - 26:08.000:  through Ecuador. Gradually and slowly, they started to produce drugs inside the Ecuador.
26:08.000 - 26:13.640:  We have to remember that a lot of factors like, for example, the peace process in Colombia,
26:13.660 - 26:19.440:  between the government and the fact, change the logic in the area completely. We have now
26:20.200 - 26:27.440:  more minimal groups, but more violent. And then we have the gangs from Mexico coming to Ecuador
26:27.740 - 26:33.460:  to accelerate all these processes. So a lot of factors are behind these violence.
26:34.080 - 26:40.580:  Matias Sabel. Imagine being able to find your way around with the help of hidden technology in
26:40.580 - 26:46.540:  your clothes. Well, scientists in America have designed wearable textile belts and sleeves
26:46.960 - 26:51.680:  that can help you navigate using a series of pressure-based signals to direct you.
26:52.220 - 26:57.080:  This could be particularly useful for those with visual impairment. So how does it work?
26:57.880 - 27:03.240:  Dan Preston is an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Rice University in the US
27:03.240 - 27:09.300:  where this was developed. We've incorporated haptic cues, things that take advantage of your
27:09.300 - 27:15.520:  sense of touch, to convey information. We're using pressurized air to apply forces to the body
27:15.520 - 27:20.680:  from within the fabric materials from which we're composing these wearables and garments.
27:20.680 - 27:26.740:  And so it feels like a gentle push on the body. We've incorporated it in wristbands and sleeves
27:26.740 - 27:34.720:  and shirts. The actual region that applies force is a little bit bigger than a centimeter by a
27:34.720 - 27:40.120:  centimeter. But when we incorporate many of them, they can cover the entire shirt or sleeve that
27:40.120 - 27:46.540:  we're using in this work. And the crucial question for fashionistas, what do the clothes actually
27:46.540 - 27:52.340:  look like? We'd like to think that right now they look very high-tech but also very sleek. They're
27:52.340 - 27:57.200:  super low profile so it looks a lot like any other piece of clothing you might pull out of a closet.
27:57.780 - 28:02.660:  And one of the really big advantages here is actually the customizability. So we can make all kinds
28:02.660 - 28:08.420:  of different shapes and sizes for these textile-based or fabric-based wearable haptic devices.
28:09.000 - 28:13.200:  Ongoing work is looking at how to tailor these for each application or each individual.
28:14.200 - 28:21.180:  Dan Preston, a major music label has signed a digital pop star whose voice has been made with the
28:21.180 - 28:27.620:  help of artificial intelligence. Warner music now have no nori on the books, who's releasing her
28:27.620 - 28:34.440:  first song with German DJ Ale Farben. So what does this type of artist mean for the music industry?
28:34.960 - 28:37.400:  Shionna McCullan's been to Berlin to find out.
28:44.360 - 28:50.620:  This is the sound of Nunuuri. She's a virtual character and Instagram influencer and has worked
28:50.620 - 28:59.460:  with big fashion brands. And I've come to Berlin to meet her creator Yurg Zuber.
28:59.560 - 29:04.340:  I created her in my mind first. I did a little sketch of her. And now his creation,
29:04.340 - 29:09.700:  this avatar living in the digital world has a record deal with a major label.
29:09.940 - 29:17.480:  Oh my god, this is amazing. It was accelerating my pulse when I got the email from Warner,
29:17.480 - 29:22.720:  Music Central, Europe. They were like asking me, are you interested in music? And I say,
29:22.720 - 29:28.120:  well, what a question. Her appearance has been created using 2D graphics and motion capture.
29:28.480 - 29:32.260:  Her voice has been created with the help of artificial intelligence.
29:32.420 - 29:38.420:  We didn't want to create like a human voice. We wanted to have it a bit like technology,
29:38.420 - 29:44.240:  like a bit tech voicey. So the bass and the original voice of her is my voice.
29:44.460 - 29:47.700:  And to make the sound they wanted, they got a singer involved too.
29:47.900 - 29:53.300:  And there comes the moment where we used AI technology. Because the music from the singer,
29:53.300 - 29:59.480:  so the voice from the singer, we needed to know when he was singing high, when he was singing low,
29:59.480 - 30:03.820:  when he was singing slower, when he got more speed, when he got more pressure.
30:13.920 - 30:19.020:  Although No Noori's voice has only been helped by artificial intelligence and the AI plays a
30:19.020 - 30:25.020:  small role in this case, it's the rise of generative AI that has worried artists whose voices,
30:25.020 - 30:28.240:  lyrics and sounds have been used often without their consent.
30:28.540 - 30:33.380:  I'm Jamie and Jocka Goodwin. I'm chief executive of UK Music, which is the collective voice
30:33.380 - 30:38.200:  of the UK music industry. It's about understanding about transparency. It's about knowing what
30:38.200 - 30:43.240:  content and what data AI has been trained on. It's about ensuring that there's adequate labelling.
30:43.380 - 30:47.800:  So we know whether or not a piece of music is AI-generated. But also there's questions about
30:47.800 - 30:52.020:  things like personality rights. So at the moment in the UK, personality rights aren't really
30:52.020 - 30:57.520:  properly protected. You can essentially generate an AI version of someone of a pop star of a singer
30:57.960 - 31:02.260:  and they wouldn't have any rights about how that is used. So that's the industry bodies concern.
31:02.260 - 31:07.020:  But there are some positives too. We saw just a few weeks ago Paul McCartney talking about how
31:07.020 - 31:11.960:  they used AI to isolate one of the stems of a John Lennon's voice from one of the Beatles songs.
31:11.960 - 31:16.720:  Again, that's all being done with top admissions. It's been done in quite an exciting way.
31:17.080 - 31:18.660:  So there are sorts of huge opportunities.
31:21.200 - 31:25.540:  Berlin is known for its clubbing scenes, so it makes sense for me to ask some people outside
31:25.540 - 31:31.060:  an eight club here what they think about AI and music. I don't think fully AI music is ever going
31:31.060 - 31:35.520:  to fit a replace, creativity. For creatives, I think, although it's really
31:35.520 - 31:40.280:  interesting innovation and really exciting. On the other hand, I think a lot of artists feel almost
31:40.280 - 31:44.740:  frightened or threatened by the idea of clearly the use of AI is becoming more mainstream.
31:45.200 - 31:49.180:  But now that it's officially entering the charts, we'll ever get to number one.
31:49.180 - 31:51.160:  No, no, no. Like dummy, dummy, no.
31:51.860 - 31:53.020:  Dummy, dummy, no.
31:54.100 - 31:56.880:  No, no, no, ending that report from Shionna McCullum.
32:00.040 - 32:04.880:  And that's all from us for now. But before we go, here's Jackie with news of the next edition
