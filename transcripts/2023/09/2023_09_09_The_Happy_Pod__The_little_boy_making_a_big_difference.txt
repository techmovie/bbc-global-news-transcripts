00:18.100 - 00:19.120:  It's a real melting pot.
00:19.120 - 00:21.100:  Yeah, the surface has lost happening.

00:24.500 - 00:26.880:  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:29.600 - 00:31.460:  This is Andrew Peach in the studio in London.
00:31.840 - 00:33.920:  And this is Olgaer and currently in Kiev.
00:34.300 - 00:36.620:  All are it's great to have you with us for the happy pod this week.
00:36.620 - 00:39.060:  You're the BBC Senior International Correspondent.
00:39.220 - 00:41.940:  So often in war zones reporting on harrowing stories,
00:41.940 - 00:44.560:  but this week a really inspiring story.
00:44.800 - 00:49.780:  Yes, we've been back to Yemen where there's been a civil war now for almost a decade.
00:49.820 - 00:54.240:  And I caught up with an incredible young boy called Ahmed.
00:54.860 - 00:58.220:  I first met him two and a half years ago when he was nine.
00:58.300 - 01:03.960:  And he was teaching his fellow pupils in his school at just nine years old.
01:03.960 - 01:08.500:  But he's now 11 and we had a chance to catch up and see how he's doing now
01:08.500 - 01:11.640:  and for changes that have been for him and also for the school.
01:11.920 - 01:15.520:  It was lovely to hear you reunited and to hear some positive news as well
01:15.520 - 01:17.000:  from such a difficult part of the world.
01:17.300 - 01:19.680:  We're going to talk more about that in a little while.
01:24.900 - 01:28.360:  Also on the way the app that's teaching hundreds of thousands of people
01:28.360 - 01:30.180:  in the hall of Africa to read and write.
01:30.760 - 01:31.880:  Now I can read and write.
01:31.960 - 01:36.280:  For the future I aspire to secure a more fulfilling position than my current job
01:36.340 - 01:38.240:  and use my skills and knowledge to succeed.
01:38.580 - 01:42.140:  We'll meet happy pod listener Tori who's a lieutenant in the US Navy.
01:42.440 - 01:45.380:  The reason I had to do this interview today or tomorrow is because this weekend
01:46.060 - 01:48.500:  my mom is coming into town to watch my baby.
01:48.500 - 01:52.380:  So my husband and I can go climb another mountain in the Olympics this week.
01:52.740 - 01:54.940:  And there's an invitation to a Greek island.
01:55.060 - 01:58.760:  We are expecting you. We're waiting for you here anytime you want to visit.
01:58.860 - 02:00.340:  Are you familiar with the film Mama Mia?
02:00.540 - 02:00.940:  Oh yes.
02:01.400 - 02:05.160:  The picture you paint sounds very much like the Greek island in that movie.
02:05.160 - 02:06.420:  I have no idea whether it is.
02:06.480 - 02:07.080:  We're better.
02:12.260 - 02:14.020:  First back to my colleague, Olgaerin.
02:14.420 - 02:16.360:  Finding out that it was a complete surprise.
02:16.360 - 02:20.340:  We had gone to Yemen and one of the stories we intended to do
02:20.540 - 02:22.420:  was about a bombed out school.
02:23.300 - 02:26.160:  Now when we arrived morning assembly was taking place
02:26.820 - 02:30.940:  and there was a young boy who was leading the assembly with a very loud voice
02:31.500 - 02:34.160:  barking out instructions to his fellow students.
02:37.320 - 02:38.120:  And that was Ahmed.
02:38.400 - 02:41.580:  And later on my cameraman happened to look into one of the classrooms
02:41.580 - 02:45.500:  and saw Ahmed standing at the top of the class actually teaching
02:46.280 - 02:48.300:  which we discovered he does quite regularly.
02:48.300 - 02:51.600:  If the teachers don't turn up he stands in and takes the class.
02:52.400 - 02:55.700:  And it was only at that point that we realized that Ahmed was blind.
02:56.320 - 02:57.840:  And he teaches the other students.
02:58.100 - 02:59.740:  And I remember asking him at the time,
03:00.380 - 03:02.200:  did he have any difficulty keeping them in order?
03:02.200 - 03:03.640:  And he said absolutely not.
03:03.860 - 03:05.040:  They do everything I tell them.
03:05.320 - 03:06.200:  He loves teaching.
03:06.720 - 03:07.720:  Amazing young man.
03:07.720 - 03:13.360:  And how did you come to go back two years after you met Ahmed
03:13.360 - 03:16.740:  to meet up with him again and to see what progress has been made?
03:17.340 - 03:21.520:  Well, we always wanted to return but getting into Yemen is very difficult for journalists.
03:21.520 - 03:24.820:  You have to get an endless series of permissions.
03:24.920 - 03:28.160:  And in fact it took us two years to get permission to go back.
03:28.160 - 03:30.780:  But Ahmed was always top of our list.
03:30.780 - 03:32.740:  We have kept in touch with them in the meantime.
03:32.940 - 03:36.880:  I should say that after our initial report was broadcast
03:36.880 - 03:40.300:  we had a very strong reaction from listeners and viewers.
03:40.980 - 03:42.880:  Ahmed really connected with them.
03:43.420 - 03:47.720:  Now as a result of that the charity Islamic relief set up a fundraising appeal
03:47.720 - 03:49.160:  for Ahmed and his family.
03:49.160 - 03:54.880:  And another UK charity twins also became involved and over the past two years
03:55.660 - 03:58.860:  they have managed to refurbish several classrooms.
03:59.420 - 04:00.840:  They got in school supplies.
04:00.840 - 04:05.300:  They got in desks and a Yemeni donor also became involved
04:05.340 - 04:10.660:  and constructed a complete new school block with brand new classrooms.
04:11.540 - 04:13.960:  And all of this really came about because of Ahmed.
04:13.960 - 04:17.640:  He said he wanted walls, he wanted glass and the windows
04:17.640 - 04:19.700:  so they weren't studying in the rain.
04:19.700 - 04:22.260:  He wanted lights, he wanted blackboards.
04:22.780 - 04:24.180:  So he gave us this long list.
04:24.180 - 04:26.220:  And batteries on the list as well, didn't they?
04:26.980 - 04:29.600:  He said batteries and the most important thing is that they work.
04:30.140 - 04:35.740:  So batteries were on his list and most of the things on that list he now has.
04:35.900 - 04:39.860:  Now we should say this is a particular case and a particular school,
04:39.860 - 04:43.700:  the overall picture for Yemen is still very very difficult.
04:43.700 - 04:48.980:  And indeed the overall picture for education because one fifth of the schools in the country
04:48.980 - 04:50.360:  are not an operation.
04:50.380 - 04:55.620:  But certainly for Ahmed on the school front things are looking much better.
04:55.620 - 05:00.340:  But we should also say that he is still a child growing up in the middle of a war.
05:00.380 - 05:04.440:  People connected with Ahmed in an extraordinary way.
05:04.440 - 05:10.420:  I mean, he is a very charismatic, funny, lively young boy, very clever,
05:11.020 - 05:13.440:  full of ambition, full of hopes, full of dreams.
05:14.360 - 05:18.840:  And he has managed to keep all of that great spirit.
05:18.840 - 05:21.900:  And if anything, I would say that when we saw him this time,
05:21.900 - 05:25.300:  he seemed even more positive than he was before.
05:26.160 - 05:27.520:  He's an exceptional child.
05:27.520 - 05:29.760:  He would be exceptional in any circumstances,
05:29.760 - 05:33.260:  but certainly he's exceptional to find in tires
05:33.260 - 05:35.600:  where there are so many difficulties to overcome.
05:36.360 - 05:41.020:  But he has emerged as this incredibly bright, positive boy.
05:41.020 - 05:43.560:  And he has so many plans for his future,
05:43.800 - 05:45.400:  so many things that he wants to do.
05:46.340 - 05:50.720:  When we were sitting in the school in the refurbished classroom with the new desks,
05:51.120 - 05:53.480:  I was asking Ahmed about his plans for the future.
05:53.480 - 05:56.700:  And he reeled off a long list of things that he wanted to be.
05:58.300 - 06:03.020:  I want to be a teacher and a pilot and an engineer and a driver.
06:04.120 - 06:04.720:  Or a doctor.
06:05.380 - 06:06.500:  I want to be everything.
06:06.780 - 06:09.020:  Do you think you'll be able to do all these things?
06:09.580 - 06:10.740:  Yes, sure.
06:11.040 - 06:12.820:  I would do everything.
06:13.620 - 06:15.780:  And I will marry a beautiful girl from the city.
06:16.280 - 06:19.880:  And honestly, it was such a classic Ahmed kind of comment
06:19.900 - 06:22.640:  said with his usual cheeky grin.
06:23.280 - 06:26.160:  So when you leave, you couldn't take this child away in your heart.
06:26.160 - 06:27.580:  He's impossible to forget.
06:28.120 - 06:29.560:  And tell me a bit about, you know,
06:29.560 - 06:32.480:  what I think is probably quite rare in your role,
06:32.480 - 06:36.240:  which is to be reporting on something so positive and inspiring.
06:36.240 - 06:38.120:  That's not normally what you do.
06:39.320 - 06:42.020:  I think Andrew, it's true to say I wouldn't be accused
06:42.020 - 06:44.000:  of being the good news correspondent.
06:44.020 - 06:48.220:  I mean, over the years, many of the areas that I've covered and the stories
06:48.220 - 06:51.320:  that I've covered have involved, very protracted conflicts.
06:52.140 - 06:55.900:  But every so often, you do come across somebody who is so exceptional
06:56.520 - 06:57.520:  that they shine out.
06:57.760 - 07:01.460:  And Ahmed is definitely that kind of child, that kind of young man.
07:01.600 - 07:03.180:  And I'm on a human level.
07:03.180 - 07:05.500:  You can't but relate to somebody like that.
07:05.540 - 07:06.900:  And I think it wasn't just us.
07:06.940 - 07:09.440:  We had the pleasure and the privilege of meeting them in person.
07:10.000 - 07:12.800:  But I think he had the same impact on people who saw the story.
07:13.700 - 07:15.320:  Our senior international correspondent,
07:15.320 - 07:20.060:  Oliver Gehrin, you can see more about that story at bbc.com slash news.
07:20.540 - 07:24.740:  Now to the app that's teaching hundreds of thousands of people in the Hall of Africa
07:24.740 - 07:28.720:  to read and write, Darius was developed by British Somali refugee
07:28.720 - 07:31.120:  term tech entrepreneur, Ismail Ahmed.
07:31.680 - 07:34.320:  Conflict, climate change and a lack of infrastructure.
07:34.320 - 07:37.840:  I mean, the region has one of the worst literacy rates in the world.
07:38.340 - 07:40.500:  Sorry, my net has been finding out how that's changing.
07:45.680 - 07:50.220:  As the call to prayer echoes in the distance, Houdan is finishing doing the dishes.
07:51.560 - 07:55.360:  Raptain Hammaruna Bhaya, the 23-year-old, is working as a cleaner
07:55.580 - 07:57.760:  in Somali land's capital, Hargaysa.
07:59.180 - 08:03.240:  Until recently, she believed this was the only job she could ever aspire to do.
08:03.860 - 08:06.940:  But now, in her lunch break, she takes out her mobile phone
08:07.440 - 08:10.540:  and starts doing something she never thought possible.
08:16.820 - 08:20.260:  When I was a child, I couldn't afford to go to school, neither could my parents,
08:20.320 - 08:21.700:  and I grew up in the countryside.
08:23.600 - 08:27.180:  A couple of months ago, a colleague told her about an app, Darius,
08:27.620 - 08:29.580:  that teaches people to read and write.
08:29.780 - 08:32.080:  It was a game changer for her.
08:32.780 - 08:34.480:  Now I can read and write.
08:34.640 - 08:38.900:  For the future, I aspire to secure a more fulfilling position than my current job
08:39.000 - 08:40.760:  and use my skills and knowledge to succeed.
08:41.560 - 08:46.160:  The UN Agency UNICEF estimates that about three adults in four
08:46.160 - 08:50.440:  cannot read and write, and one child in four is not in school.
08:51.280 - 08:53.820:  And despite local and international efforts,
08:54.380 - 08:57.080:  literacy rates have been improving slowly.
08:57.760 - 09:04.740:  One of the unique aspects in the heart of Africa is the successful mobile money services.
09:05.320 - 09:09.680:  So that gives us an opportunity to use the mobile phones
09:10.300 - 09:12.220:  to tackle this learning crisis.
09:12.620 - 09:14.160:  This is Ismail Ahmed.
09:14.160 - 09:18.340:  He came to the UK as a refugee during the war in Somalia,
09:18.840 - 09:21.620:  and later became a successful tech entrepreneur.
09:22.360 - 09:25.160:  During the pandemic, his charity developed Darius.
09:25.680 - 09:27.800:  The app is free and works offline.
09:28.360 - 09:31.880:  It used to take to go to classes to learn their own mother tongue.
09:32.400 - 09:39.120:  And now we have thousands of users who were able to become functional
09:39.120 - 09:40.900:  literally their own mother tongue.
09:41.260 - 09:42.620:  We are going to a class.
09:42.800 - 09:46.660:  This approach aims to solve an issue that the local government and NGOs
09:46.900 - 09:48.340:  have long struggled with.
09:49.060 - 09:55.640:  Because of international sanctions, most banks cannot operate in Somalia.
09:55.640 - 09:59.780:  People use their phones and mobile banking apps to make payments,
10:00.640 - 10:04.300:  so not being able to read can make everyday life difficult.
10:04.300 - 10:07.880:  Mombarak knows this well.
10:09.140 - 10:11.740:  As he leads his camel to pasture through the high grass,
10:12.260 - 10:16.080:  the young camel heard it keeps his eyes down on his fold.
10:17.460 - 10:20.620:  When he was a kid, he could only go to school for two years.
10:21.320 - 10:24.340:  As an adult, he found himself struggling doing business.
10:24.340 - 10:27.900:  Sometimes I couldn't read my customers' names.
10:27.940 - 10:29.880:  There was a big barrier there.
10:31.040 - 10:35.060:  Now whenever he can, he sits in the shade to take classes on his phone.
10:35.660 - 10:38.940:  But his camels are grazing among big green shrubs.
10:39.620 - 10:40.240:  Well, how do you go?
10:41.260 - 10:42.420:  I can now read a long story.
10:43.040 - 10:44.800:  It's helped me to read my customers' names,
10:44.800 - 10:46.860:  their payments and messages on the apps.
10:47.520 - 10:48.400:  I can read news articles.
10:52.760 - 10:59.300:  Like Mombarak, over 350,000 people in the Horn of Africa are now learning to read and write.
10:59.900 - 11:00.660:  Thanks to this app.
11:01.740 - 11:02.760:  Sorry, a minute to reporting.
11:02.760 - 11:05.700:  We're off to the Greek island of Tilos now.
11:05.700 - 11:08.960:  It's small, 745 people small.
11:09.440 - 11:13.060:  As we heard earlier, if you picture Mamma Mia, you won't go too far wrong.
11:13.560 - 11:16.960:  Tilos is the world's first zero waste island.
11:17.380 - 11:18.420:  There's no landfill site.
11:18.420 - 11:21.900:  Everything is repaired, reused, or recycled.
11:21.900 - 11:24.920:  It means the island's delicate ecosystems are protected
11:24.920 - 11:27.020:  and there are new job opportunities too.
11:27.400 - 11:29.080:  I've been talking to the woman behind all this,
11:29.100 - 11:30.680:  the Mayor Maria Kamalifero,
11:30.680 - 11:33.880:  with the help of Jenny Janopoulou, who translated for us.
11:34.360 - 11:37.860:  It was a suggestion that we had
11:37.860 - 11:40.560:  from the owner of Polygonis and Polypynopoulos.
11:41.220 - 11:42.900:  He called her and he goes,
11:43.280 - 11:43.800:  Hi, Maria.
11:43.800 - 11:46.360:  How would you like not to have any garbage on your island?
11:46.760 - 11:50.060:  It sounds like the kind of ideas one might have after a few drinks.
11:51.220 - 11:52.720:  That's what she thought as well.
11:52.920 - 11:55.620:  Yeah, either somebody is joking with me or he's drunk.
11:55.900 - 11:59.860:  How did it come to be to be taken seriously and actually looked into?
12:00.320 - 12:01.120:  I just said no more.
12:01.120 - 12:05.080:  It started explaining the way that this could be done
12:05.080 - 12:09.120:  to transform the island into a no-waste island.
12:09.320 - 12:10.300:  So that's when she said,
12:10.300 - 12:13.100:  OK, we have something good for you now.
12:13.440 - 12:16.440:  And it's a huge change in behaviour we're describing here.
12:16.740 - 12:20.640:  It used to be nearly 90% of waste going to landfill
12:21.220 - 12:24.640:  and now it's literally no waste going to landfill.
12:24.640 - 12:27.160:  So what's changed? How have you made it work?
12:27.740 - 12:28.580:  Eskola.
12:28.960 - 12:30.400:  Eskola. Eskola.
12:32.020 - 12:33.440:  Is there a motive that is going to happen?
12:33.440 - 12:36.160:  We thought it would have issues with the older people,
12:36.540 - 12:39.420:  you know, because they're used to some waste.
12:39.420 - 12:41.340:  But actually, they were the best students.
12:41.420 - 12:42.520:  They learned the fastest.
12:42.940 - 12:46.120:  Oh, they have also taken an award for their efforts.
12:48.100 - 12:50.120:  And what happens to the rubbish now?
12:50.120 - 12:52.480:  What do your residents now do with their rubbish
12:52.480 - 12:55.480:  that they used to put in the bin and used to end up in landfill?
12:56.020 - 13:00.200:  Each business, everybody has specific containers
13:00.860 - 13:02.700:  that are for recycling.
13:03.400 - 13:06.420:  And everything goes to the recycling plant.
13:06.420 - 13:08.700:  They get separated. They get composted.
13:09.000 - 13:13.720:  They get reused 90% of recycling at this moment.
13:14.060 - 13:17.400:  And the 10% doesn't go to be burned and thrown away.
13:17.420 - 13:22.480:  It goes for reusing and composting and for energy.
13:23.320 - 13:24.260:  Tu vasikoi, ne?
13:25.900 - 13:28.480:  We don't work as we say you do.
13:29.020 - 13:31.920:  We try to involve people in decisions.
13:32.600 - 13:34.060:  We become one with them.
13:34.940 - 13:38.540:  And we try to talk with them and see how we can achieve things
13:39.080 - 13:39.220:  together.
13:39.220 - 13:43.180:  And she says, that is the secret to achieving anything.
13:43.640 - 13:46.060:  She gathered the people, even the little kids,
13:46.060 - 13:48.060:  the older people, everybody.
13:48.760 - 13:50.380:  And we talked about it.
13:50.380 - 13:53.100:  And we decided how we're going to start,
13:53.100 - 13:55.740:  how we're going to progress, and how it's going to go.
13:56.340 - 13:58.920:  And do you think other towns, cities, countries,
13:58.920 - 14:00.980:  other islands could do this?
14:00.980 - 14:02.800:  Maybe if Maria was in charge of them?
14:03.440 - 14:05.440:  Oh, yeah. I can bet you that.
14:08.760 - 14:11.220:  If Maria was in charge, the world would be a better place
14:11.220 - 14:12.520:  if you asked my opinion.
14:13.400 - 14:15.140:  From the Greek island of Teeloste,
14:15.180 - 14:16.720:  the Mayor, Maria Kamaliferi.
14:17.260 - 14:18.780:  Now, last week on the Global News podcast,
14:18.780 - 14:21.840:  I asked you to get in touch with your little win,
14:21.840 - 14:24.360:  the thing that's happened in your life or where you live.
14:24.820 - 14:26.940:  That's made your week no matter how small.
14:27.240 - 14:28.700:  Thank you for so many emails.
14:29.160 - 14:31.960:  Hannah in Sydney, Australia, got in touch to say the barista
14:31.960 - 14:34.440:  at her local cafe gave her a free coffee.
14:34.440 - 14:37.620:  Then the next day, she found a five-dollar note on the floor.
14:37.700 - 14:38.580:  So she got another one.
14:39.140 - 14:41.440:  Carly emailed from St. Petersburg in Florida
14:41.740 - 14:44.360:  to thank her neighbors for helping to keep her home dry
14:44.360 - 14:47.040:  and free from debris during the recent hurricane.
14:47.480 - 14:51.560:  I had someone watching over me at a time of pure panic, says Carly.
14:52.180 - 14:54.460:  Tori is a lieutenant in the US Navy.
14:54.460 - 14:57.040:  She listens to our podcast in Washington state
14:57.040 - 14:58.780:  and told me about her little win.
14:59.400 - 15:03.740:  I got to go out and do some big wall rock climbing
15:04.380 - 15:05.560:  out in the Cascade Mountains.
15:05.740 - 15:09.740:  And that's big for me because I have an infant.
15:09.740 - 15:11.460:  She's now four and a half months old.
15:11.460 - 15:15.340:  And I've been feeding her and raising her for the last four
15:15.340 - 15:15.780:  and a half months.
15:15.780 - 15:17.660:  It's been hard to get out with an infant.
15:17.860 - 15:19.680:  My little brother and my sister-in-law
15:20.240 - 15:24.100:  were kind enough to babysit her for 14 hours while we went out
15:24.100 - 15:26.900:  and hiked and then climbed a big day.
15:27.200 - 15:28.480:  So that was huge for us.
15:28.680 - 15:29.680:  That sounds amazing.
15:29.680 - 15:32.300:  And a lot of new parents listening
15:32.300 - 15:35.080:  will appreciate just how hard that is
15:35.080 - 15:38.020:  to get everything to get out of the house
15:38.040 - 15:39.740:  and to be able to do something fun like that.
15:40.260 - 15:40.540:  It is.
15:40.640 - 15:43.700:  And we were determined that having kids wasn't going to stop us
15:43.700 - 15:44.820:  from doing the things we loved.
15:44.820 - 15:47.760:  But we understood that there were going to have to be adjustments
15:47.760 - 15:49.440:  to how we went about doing that.
15:49.880 - 15:52.500:  People will be interested to hear that you serve in the US Navy,
15:52.500 - 15:55.040:  which may explain the kind of character you are
15:55.040 - 15:57.920:  and why getting out and climbing some rocks is important.
15:58.700 - 16:01.600:  Yes, and we're fortunate enough to be stationed in an area
16:01.600 - 16:04.200:  where the outdoors are super accessible to us.
16:04.200 - 16:06.060:  So we both have that kind of drive
16:06.060 - 16:08.360:  where we love to get out and do things.
16:08.380 - 16:10.320:  And it was really big for us to be able to do that.
16:10.320 - 16:13.300:  I did have to bring my manual breast pump.
16:13.860 - 16:16.600:  And I had to express milk while we were hiking.
16:16.600 - 16:18.940:  And I'm not too shy about doing it in public.
16:18.940 - 16:21.480:  I think it's just a very natural thing that mothers need to do.
16:21.480 - 16:23.760:  So we got to the bottom of our climb.
16:23.760 - 16:25.500:  It was about a three hour hike in
16:25.540 - 16:27.600:  and about that time was time for me to express.
16:27.600 - 16:30.580:  So I just had my little manual pump with me
16:30.580 - 16:33.740:  and while my husband was setting up the ropes and all the gear,
16:34.160 - 16:36.180:  I was just sitting there expressing milk
16:36.260 - 16:38.300:  and making sure that I could be able to provide
16:38.300 - 16:39.460:  for my baby a little bit later.
16:39.600 - 16:40.580:  So it was a balance.
16:40.580 - 16:42.240:  But we're willing to work a little harder
16:42.240 - 16:44.080:  to be able to keep doing the things we love.
16:44.440 - 16:46.280:  Now, Tori, I'm worried about next week for you
16:46.280 - 16:48.400:  because this week you've climbed the Cascade Mountains
16:48.560 - 16:49.760:  and you've had a brilliant time.
16:49.760 - 16:51.340:  What have you got planned for next week
16:51.480 - 16:52.980:  because you're not going to want to sit at home.
16:52.980 - 16:53.680:  I just know it.
16:54.420 - 16:55.020:  It's so funny.
16:55.020 - 16:58.800:  This weekend my mom is coming into town to watch my baby.
16:58.800 - 17:01.420:  So my husband and I can go climb another mountain
17:01.420 - 17:02.720:  in the Olympics this week.
17:03.320 - 17:07.900:  Well, to combine being a new mom with the activity
17:08.440 - 17:11.160:  and also the career as a lieutenant in the US Navy
17:11.160 - 17:11.820:  is incredible.
17:11.820 - 17:12.940:  There must be more than one of you.
17:13.320 - 17:13.920:  Oh, I love it.
17:13.940 - 17:16.140:  Yeah, I love my job so much.
17:16.420 - 17:19.060:  And I also really love living where we do
17:19.060 - 17:20.720:  and having the opportunities that it presents.
17:20.720 - 17:23.160:  So it's just, if it's with my personality,
17:23.160 - 17:24.220:  I think in my husbands.
17:24.880 - 17:27.960:  That's Tori off to conquer the Olympic mountains this weekend.
17:27.960 - 17:31.020:  Jess got in touch from Perth in Western Australia.
17:31.380 - 17:32.960:  Jess wanted to tell me about OD,
17:32.960 - 17:35.860:  who's an eight year old miniature Australian Bulldog
17:35.860 - 17:40.840:  who is the world record holder of fastest dog to count from one to 10.
17:41.360 - 17:43.900:  It was actually a record created just for OD.
17:44.420 - 17:46.620:  He can do it in one minute 38 seconds.
17:47.160 - 17:49.280:  So some good things do come out of lockdown.
17:49.280 - 17:52.120:  Uh, OD was driving us nuts
17:52.320 - 17:54.100:  because he was barking at every single person
17:54.140 - 17:55.400:  who walked past our house.
17:55.620 - 17:58.580:  So I decided that I needed to teach him how to be quiet.
17:59.460 - 18:02.240:  So in order to teach him how to be quiet,
18:02.240 - 18:03.520:  you have to teach him how to speak.
18:04.600 - 18:06.420:  And then it kind of just progressed from there.
18:06.420 - 18:07.860:  I was bored during lockdown and thought,
18:07.860 - 18:09.520:  OK, let's see if this little guy can count.
18:10.660 - 18:12.740:  OD, you have to make a recording for BBC.
18:13.700 - 18:15.980:  OK, now can you do three?
18:18.360 - 18:19.120:  Good boy.
18:20.600 - 18:21.160:  What's four?
18:23.840 - 18:23.980:  Good.
18:25.960 - 18:26.740:  For about five.
18:27.860 - 18:28.940:  No, not high five.
18:31.880 - 18:33.540:  Never work with children or animals.
18:34.320 - 18:35.120:  Can you say I love you?
18:37.800 - 18:39.760:  We wrote again a very lockdown and said,
18:39.760 - 18:41.400:  our dog can count is this a thing.
18:42.040 - 18:45.420:  And they very generously wrote a world record just for him.
18:45.940 - 18:47.580:  There's a took a bit of back and forth.
18:47.580 - 18:50.320:  And of course, it's not just one, two, three, four, five.
18:50.320 - 18:54.060:  We had to randomize the numbers every time we make attempt
18:54.060 - 18:59.000:  with the consent of a vet to say he was all very, very spoiled
18:59.000 - 19:02.080:  and well loved and healthy and some time keepers.
19:02.140 - 19:04.980:  And yeah, just though we filmed it and thought,
19:04.980 - 19:06.100:  well, we'll see how we go.
19:06.100 - 19:08.820:  And we were very excited when the certificate arrived.
19:08.820 - 19:10.040:  I don't know how excited OD was.
19:10.260 - 19:11.900:  He may have been more excited about all the intention.
19:12.540 - 19:13.260:  Alrighty, come here.
19:13.540 - 19:14.260:  Let's see if you'll cooperate.
19:15.260 - 19:16.840:  Buddy, can you count for me?
19:16.840 - 19:17.560:  Can you do three?
19:18.180 - 19:19.060:  Count to one, two, three.
19:19.880 - 19:20.880:  Good boy.
19:23.640 - 19:25.280:  OD and Jess in Perth.
19:29.900 - 19:32.620:  Now we'd love to hear about your little win email,
19:32.620 - 19:36.340:  globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk

19:42.860 - 19:43.340:  Still to come.
19:43.900 - 19:46.900:  When you sing a lullaby to your child,
19:47.520 - 19:49.320:  you're getting all kinds of feedback, right,
19:49.320 - 19:51.500:  from the way they're breathing, from their movement.
19:51.500 - 19:54.720:  And that helps you in real time adjust what you're doing.
19:55.080 - 19:56.460:  A new Arabic lullaby.
20:06.780 - 20:10.100:  The attacker had very good knowledge of banking systems.
20:10.420 - 20:12.520:  $3.1 billion in stolen funds.
20:12.720 - 20:13.800:  Money laundering operations.

20:36.980 - 20:40.500:  Around the world, museums are wrestling with what to do with artifacts
20:40.500 - 20:42.400:  acquired as a result of colonialism.
20:43.100 - 20:45.720:  This week Manchester Museum in the UK held a ceremony
20:45.720 - 20:48.480:  to repatriate items taken from the Aboriginal
20:48.480 - 20:52.020:  and Indylyakuia community on an island off the coast of Australia.
20:52.560 - 20:54.900:  One of the highlights of the collection is a group of dolls
20:54.900 - 20:57.400:  made from shells that children would have played with.
20:57.820 - 21:00.280:  Our reporter Beth Timmins went along to find out more.
21:07.320 - 21:09.180:  That's the song of Yarnum and Malia,
21:09.580 - 21:13.820:  Iankidaba, Langua, playing at the University of Manchester's museum.
21:14.120 - 21:17.740:  It's about 14 clans and is sung by aunties from the Aboriginal
21:17.740 - 21:22.900:  and Indylyakuia community celebrating the return of 174 artifacts.
21:26.900 - 21:30.880:  Across the world, request for cultural heritage required during colonial periods,
21:31.240 - 21:32.120:  a gaining momentum.
21:32.500 - 21:36.780:  And this collection, traded and bought by sociologist Professor Peter Warslin
21:36.780 - 21:41.020:  early 50s, will now be returned to its rightful owners in Groot Island
21:41.560 - 21:43.620:  off the coast of Australia's northern territory.
21:44.120 - 21:49.480:  One of whom, elder Danjabana Nolina Lara, was tearful as she thanked those at the ceremony.
22:05.300 - 22:09.400:  The Warsley collection includes fishing spares, boomerangs and shell dolls,
22:09.400 - 22:13.960:  painted with totemic designs to represent Mamarika and Borough clans.
22:14.160 - 22:17.240:  I spoke to delegates from the Anindylyakuia community,
22:17.240 - 22:21.540:  Nolina Macy Lara and Amathia Mamarika after the ceremony.
22:21.880 - 22:23.400:  I'm so proud of my people.
22:23.980 - 22:27.700:  It's been a wonderful journey for me on the way to Manchester
22:28.560 - 22:32.020:  and I hope you guys also from all around the world.
22:32.380 - 22:36.660:  I hope you're also happy about your artifacts have been returned.
22:37.380 - 22:44.000:  And why is it important for you to have these shells and the other 174 objects?
22:44.000 - 22:50.100:  The artifacts are going back home and you want to give the knowledge and skills to our future leaders.
22:50.720 - 22:54.220:  It's not only a shell, it's got meanings and stories about the door shells
22:54.580 - 22:56.020:  and it's very important to us.
22:56.900 - 23:00.280:  On the table, there are some shells that are about as big as my finger.
23:00.780 - 23:03.280:  Some of them are wrapped in parts of fabric which have been
23:03.700 - 23:05.020:  hand-painted with ochre.
23:05.440 - 23:07.820:  Some of them are smaller and they represent the children
23:07.820 - 23:10.820:  and some of the shells look like they've been wrapped with string.
23:10.820 - 23:16.120:  They're beautiful colours and designs and no one's being allowed to film or photograph
23:16.120 - 23:20.240:  what's on the table because of its importance in the ceremony today.
23:21.020 - 23:23.660:  After a grueling four flights over three days,
23:23.960 - 23:27.560:  this part of Anindylyakuia heritage will be back in Groot Island
23:27.740 - 23:31.980:  where Amathia told me her grandmother had played with them half a century ago.
23:32.420 - 23:37.920:  All these things we bring back home because it's got a dream time stories in it,
23:38.440 - 23:42.580:  our history, it's got everything on it, our toe-toms.
23:43.420 - 23:51.040:  So we need these things, our ancestors, all in time to bring them back to our country,
23:51.800 - 23:56.180:  for our future to keep on doing it, to make it a life.
24:02.340 - 24:05.920:  Beth Timmons reporting.
24:06.580 - 24:10.420:  Lollabies are sung the world over to help children drift off to sleep.
24:10.420 - 24:14.880:  Now, a special one's been composed to help children in war zones across the Middle East.
24:15.380 - 24:19.460:  Written in Arabic and performed by these seriants sing a songwriter, Galia Chaker,
24:19.460 - 24:24.800:  frequencies of peace has just been given the backing of the UN Refugee agency, the UNHCR.
24:25.380 - 24:30.120:  Dr. Daniel Bowling is a neuroscientist at Stanford University who helped to create the Lollabye.
24:48.460 - 24:53.540:  Our perspective is to bring the composition into alignment with what we know about Lollabye,
24:53.980 - 24:59.540:  from studies of Lollabye around the world and from looking at common patterns across cultures.
25:00.100 - 25:04.460:  So when you do that, you notice certain things, the songs that are traditionally used
25:04.980 - 25:12.760:  to help facilitate sleep have characteristics such as simple repeating melodies, slow even rhythms,
25:13.680 - 25:18.180:  smooth soft attacks, limited high frequency energy, things of that nature.
25:33.320 - 25:36.760:  There are some things that make it special and there are things that kind of make it
25:36.840 - 25:43.220:  similar to other Lollabies. So it was written and performed in Arabic. It was purpose built for
25:43.220 - 25:49.140:  these children, but at the same time, it's not as if this Lollabye would work and another Lollabye
25:49.140 - 25:54.700:  would not. What's really important with a Lollabye is that it conforms to these principles.
25:55.480 - 26:01.520:  When you sing a Lollabye to your child, you're getting all kinds of feedback from the way
26:01.520 - 26:06.320:  they're breathing, from their movement, and that helps you in real time adjust what you're doing.
26:06.360 - 26:12.020:  You know, maybe you don't start the next verse or maybe you slow down extra, but without that
26:12.020 - 26:18.600:  kind of feedback, it's really extra important that very basic principles are maintained and
26:18.900 - 26:24.820:  stop to communicate it. It's not as if the fate of these children is fully determined by their
26:24.820 - 26:29.560:  circumstances, but it certainly makes it more difficult for them, you know, sleep is kind of the
26:29.560 - 26:34.960:  bedrock of brain maintenance. So it's really important, and music can really play a role there.
26:35.660 - 26:41.260:  You know, Lollabye is something that parents do anyways. So it really is a really powerful thing,
26:42.240 - 26:47.580:  as any of us know, who have been moved by music, the power is, you know, undeniable. There are
26:47.580 - 26:53.100:  a few stimuli in the world like music that are capable of sending shivers down your spine and
26:53.100 - 26:55.260:  bringing you to tears. Music is certainly one of them.
26:58.540 - 27:01.740:  Isn't that lovely? Frequencies of Peace by Galia Chaker.
