00:43.720 - 00:48.940:  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Monday 11 September, these are our main stories.
00:48.940 - 00:53.780:  The suspended Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales has resigned
00:53.780 - 00:58.860:  after he forcibly kissed the player following the country's women's World Cup win.
00:59.740 - 01:03.500:  Sam Eid has started reaching mountain communities in Morocco that will
01:03.540 - 01:08.760:  worst affected by the earthquake, but many villages are almost totally destroyed.
01:10.100 - 01:15.860:  Aid groups in Sudan have denounced the military after its airstrikes killed dozens of civilians in
01:15.860 - 01:31.880:  cartoon. Also in this podcast, we speak to an amazing lady who is recording the sounds
01:31.900 - 01:38.780:  of the birds and animals in Europe's last primeval forest without being able to see any of them.
01:43.260 - 01:48.900:  After weeks of refusing to resign for kissing a female player during World Cup celebrations,
01:48.900 - 01:55.780:  the Spanish Football Chief Luis Rubiales has finally caved into the growing calls for him to quit.
01:56.520 - 02:01.460:  Jenny Emosa, the player he grabbed in Kirst, filed a legal complaint against him last week.
02:02.120 - 02:07.780:  While still insisting he'd done nothing wrong, Mr. Rubiales announced his departure on a British
02:07.780 - 02:12.180:  television show uncensored hosted by the journalist, Piers Morgan.
02:43.740 - 02:48.640:  Our reporter, Sergi Fukata, who's been following this story for the past three weeks says the
02:48.640 - 02:54.240:  announcement came as a surprise. It was not expected. In fact, just a couple of weeks ago,
02:54.240 - 02:59.060:  he was very defiant in a press conference saying several times, I will not resign, I will not
02:59.060 - 03:03.800:  resign. So we remember that because other members of the Football Association were clapping him.
03:04.220 - 03:10.460:  But I have to say that there was mounting pressure on him and even his closest allies in the
03:10.460 - 03:15.740:  past few weeks were kind of distancing from him. In fact, today he's admitted that he couldn't
03:15.740 - 03:22.760:  continue leading the Spanish Football Association and that he doesn't want this whole incident to harm
03:22.760 - 03:27.860:  the Spanish Football. But I have to say that he's living fighting at the same time because he said
03:27.860 - 03:33.560:  that he's been really proud of his work in the past few years and he talks about this proportionate
03:33.560 - 03:40.520:  campaign against him. Yes, he was very emotional, defending himself even now. But he's also admitting
03:40.520 - 03:46.800:  that Spain wants to host the men's football world cup in 2030 and this viewer is standing in
03:46.800 - 03:52.480:  the way of that. What's the reaction been in Spain itself to this whole affair? Probably a
03:52.480 - 03:57.940:  noberwhelming majority are celebrating or at least pleased that he's gone. In fact, the phrase
03:57.940 - 04:04.240:  Nobo Yadimitir, I will not resign, has been trending on social media. So lots of people mocking him
04:04.240 - 04:08.600:  because just a few days he was saying one thing, well now he's done the opposite. The Spanish
04:08.600 - 04:14.400:  government is probably pleased as well because they had been trying to get rid of him for the past few
04:14.560 - 04:20.000:  weeks. But yeah, overwhelming majority of people happy with this decision. And we've just recently
04:20.000 - 04:25.780:  seen the Spanish Football Coach Jorge Vilda going. He's going now, Luis Rubiales. What does this
04:25.780 - 04:30.980:  all mean for women's football in Spain? I think that this is a victory for the Spanish national
04:30.980 - 04:36.340:  team because you may remember that some of the players didn't actually take part in the competition
04:36.340 - 04:42.040:  because they wanted changes with the coach, with the federation. And for women as a whole,
04:42.100 - 04:48.020:  this is an issue that was more than football. It went beyond football, I would say. And this is
04:48.260 - 04:53.120:  something that everyone in the country has been talking about. And Mr. Rubiales was very,
04:53.120 - 04:59.340:  very isolated on this. Sergio Facada. Next to Morocco, and the government says it's distributing aid
04:59.340 - 05:05.040:  from several countries as a number of people known to have died in Friday's earthquake has risen
05:05.040 - 05:12.860:  to more than 2,100 villages and the Atlas mountains have been using their bare hands to dig out people
05:13.360 - 05:18.100:  who've perished in the earthquake. But I've also been working with rescuers to try to find others
05:18.100 - 05:24.040:  who may still be alive under the rubble. It's reported that some survivors are struggling to find
05:24.040 - 05:30.080:  food and water. Some hilltop villages, many of them built of mud bricks, have been almost
05:30.080 - 05:36.280:  totally destroyed. The authorities say thousands more people have been left with severe
05:36.280 - 05:41.380:  injuries. Many villages are still waiting for news of missing relatives.
05:44.560 - 05:48.860:  There are a lot of blocked roads, a lot of people can't find their parents, and a lot of people
05:48.860 - 05:54.100:  are still under the rubble. Everything went down on them, the mountains, their homes.
05:55.320 - 06:00.140:  A correspondent Nick Beak visited one village in the Atlas mountains where nearly half the
06:00.140 - 06:05.880:  residents have died or are missing. Just to warn you, you may find his report distressing.
06:08.080 - 06:14.180:  We're right in the middle of a community that has been plunged into the deepest sense of grief.
06:15.620 - 06:19.040:  A mother of a young girl who's just been pulled out a ten-year-old,
06:20.320 - 06:29.360:  collegia. She's weeping. Another lady has just fainted and down to her left. There's a family who
06:29.360 - 06:37.140:  have lost 14 loved ones. People are inconsolable there, holding one another. But what can you say
06:38.560 - 06:45.180:  at this point? The bricks and stones of the traditional houses of the Atlas mountains
06:45.180 - 06:49.660:  were no match for the size of this quake. The village of Tefracht,
06:49.980 - 06:56.720:  leveled in seconds. Nearly half of the 200 inhabitants here are confirmed dead, with many
06:56.720 - 07:03.460:  more missing or in hospital. They feel lost. They lost everything. They lost their family.
07:04.620 - 07:12.020:  They lost their houses. Everything. Hassan knows exactly where his uncle is buried under the rubble.
07:12.660 - 07:18.620:  But there's been no attempt to recover his body. This is from Allah and we thank Allah for everything.
07:19.660 - 07:25.040:  But now we need the help from our government. They are late. They are really late.
07:26.800 - 07:31.940:  The first professional emergency teams to arrive here have been Spanish firefighters and their
07:31.940 - 07:40.620:  dogs. It's not a search for signs of life, but for the dead. There are no miracle rescues in Tefracht
07:41.200 - 07:47.060:  in this epicenter of suffering. Nick Beak reporting there. While a short distance away in the
07:47.060 - 07:52.820:  popular tourist city of Marrakesh, the death toll has been much lower, but many historic buildings
07:52.820 - 07:58.620:  have been badly damaged. Businesses there have started reopening, but there are worries that
07:58.620 - 08:04.340:  tourists will stay away. A correspondent Anna Holligan spoke to us from a restaurant in Marrakesh.
08:04.740 - 08:10.280:  The picture is so different though here in Marrakesh. We are inside the Medina now, inside the
08:10.280 - 08:15.780:  UNESCO World Heritage Site. And I've been speaking to people who run the businesses, the suks,
08:15.780 - 08:22.060:  the markets that are synonymous with Marrakesh. And they're worried for a different reason. They're
08:22.100 - 08:28.100:  worried about their livelihoods. They're worried that tourists will see these images here about
08:28.100 - 08:35.340:  the death toll and stay away. And I was just speaking to a gentleman who runs a spice stall. He said,
08:35.340 - 08:40.260:  we need you more than ever. You need to come. He wanted to be at home with his family today, but he
08:40.260 - 08:44.580:  said he had to come to work because he needs the money. Where I am now, you might be able to hear
08:44.580 - 08:49.360:  we're inside one of the restaurants on the edge of the square. Now lots of tourists, lots of locals.
08:49.840 - 08:56.860:  Our view is of the Jamal Fna, most of the minaret has crumbled partially,
08:56.860 - 09:02.220:  collapsed. They've cleared away the bricks, most of the rubble as well. And what the local
09:02.220 - 09:07.680:  people are asking us is, please show the other side of this. Please show that we are back in business,
09:07.680 - 09:12.020:  we are trying to get on with our lives. But there is, I mean, the picture up there in the Atlas
09:12.080 - 09:17.260:  Mountains close to the epicenter is absolutely devastating, isn't it, with saying?
09:18.420 - 09:22.860:  Yes, because people there need the aid to get to those remote mountain villages, but as you're
09:22.880 - 09:28.280:  saying, people also need visitors to keep coming to Morocco because it has been affected so badly
09:28.280 - 09:33.120:  by the pandemic. But people must also be living in fear of aftershocks, even there in America.
09:33.180 - 09:40.100:  Absolutely. And as we were driving in here this morning, we saw thousands of people camping out on
09:40.100 - 09:45.260:  the grass sheets over their palm trees for some level of protection. They're afraid to go home,
09:45.280 - 09:50.900:  but at the same time as we walk around these ancient streets, there are a whole facades of buildings
09:50.900 - 09:57.720:  just collapse. Some people have no home to return to. And we're expecting again lots of people
09:57.720 - 10:04.760:  to be camping out because the fear of aftershocks is still very present, not just among the local
10:04.760 - 10:10.520:  residents. And it's thought about a quarter of this city of 1.2 million people has been affected
10:11.020 - 10:15.340:  by the earthquake. Tourists too, though, they're staying out of the hotels, out of the reas.
10:15.720 - 10:21.040:  And many of them are searching for ways to help. We've spoken to people who describe diving
10:21.040 - 10:25.840:  under their beds. They thought there was some kind of terror attack when the quake hit. Now they're
10:26.100 - 10:32.120:  out looking for people to help, to hand out bottles of water. We've seen images of queues outside
10:32.120 - 10:38.380:  the blood donation centres as well. People who want to do something to help, those who live here
10:38.380 - 10:45.760:  and have nowhere else to go. And a hologon in Marikesh. Next to Sudan, even by the dire
10:45.760 - 10:51.260:  standards of the civil war that has racked the country for the past five months, it's a horrific
10:51.260 - 10:57.700:  attack. Nearly 50 civilians were killed and dozens more maimed or injured in an army air strike
10:57.700 - 11:03.360:  on a densely populated area in southern Khartoum, where fighters from a rival paramilitary force
11:03.360 - 11:09.660:  the RSF are based. Residents accuse the military of using drones to target the market, a charge
11:09.660 - 11:16.300:  it denies. The medical charity, Medicin Son Frontier, describes the scene as carnage. MSF staff
11:16.300 - 11:21.840:  have been treating civilians with horrific injuries. Rebecca Kesby spoke to a Loretta Charles
11:21.840 - 11:27.540:  and medic she told her the first she knew about Sunday's blast. Some people may find the details
11:27.540 - 11:34.620:  distressing. This morning we felt the impact around seven o'clock in the morning and then
11:34.620 - 11:40.720:  shortly thereafter we saw the smoke rising from the area of the market. Could anything have prepared
11:40.720 - 11:45.960:  you for what happened next? What sort of casualties started coming in and what kind of condition
11:45.960 - 11:55.340:  were people in? We started receiving the wounded and they were mostly the blast injuries so we had
11:55.640 - 12:02.420:  traumatic amputations and penetrating trauma to the head, the chest and the abdomen.
12:02.680 - 12:10.940:  So around 730 we started receiving patients and we received about around 60 wounded coming
12:10.940 - 12:19.120:  through the door and total today we had 43 deaths. This is at the Bashayir teaching hospital I think
12:19.160 - 12:24.040:  isn't it which is a pretty big hospital but did you have enough supplies and enough
12:24.960 - 12:32.540:  medics on duty to handle that kind of scenario? Yes we had just received a shipment of supply which
12:32.540 - 12:40.580:  was wonderful and we have wonderful Sudanese colleagues who when there is an event such as this
12:40.580 - 12:47.060:  they all come in whether they're on shift or not. Loretta Charles, a medic with a charity MSF
12:47.120 - 12:52.120:  of the Bashayir teaching hospital in Cartoon. I heard more about the attack from our African
12:52.120 - 12:56.780:  regional editor Will Ross. This was an attack by the Sudanese military
12:56.860 - 13:04.400:  on Goro market. This is in the Mayo area of southern Cartoon and that area as you say is where a
13:04.400 - 13:10.580:  lot of the rapid support forces are based they're kind of embedded in the population so even though
13:10.580 - 13:16.920:  the Sudanese military is saying we do not target civilians it seems that they viewed this as a
13:16.920 - 13:22.240:  legitimate target because it's known to be an RSF area. There are also some reports that
13:22.420 - 13:28.400:  the market that was hit was where a lot of goods that have been looted by the RSF are sold.
13:28.580 - 13:33.220:  Now it's been five months of conflict neither side seems to be near victory nor showing any
13:33.220 - 13:37.920:  sign of wanting to pursue mediation. Where do we go from here? Well that's the question nobody
13:37.920 - 13:43.860:  really knows it seems to be a complete kind of log jam with neither side willing to back down
13:43.860 - 13:51.120:  at all or come to some agreement over sharing power. You've got the two generals Al-Burhan,
13:51.120 - 13:57.700:  the kind of military leader of the country and Hameti who's in charge of the rapid support forces
13:57.700 - 14:03.900:  they have sort of threw into major is tried talks before and it's certainly the case that the
14:03.900 - 14:09.120:  problem in Cartoon now is that the civilian deaths are going up quite sharply because
14:09.740 - 14:14.700:  it seems that the sort of threshold that both sides are putting up in order to agree whether
14:14.700 - 14:18.400:  they're going to carry out an attack is just getting higher and higher and civilians are trapped
14:18.900 - 14:23.200:  in the middle between these fighting forces. We're also hearing of terrible clashes in North
14:23.200 - 14:30.320:  Darfur, El Fasha with a serious number of casualties MSF is reporting during Saturday's fighting
14:30.320 - 14:36.040:  and I've spoken to another resident of Cartoon who's told me that in the north of Cartoon so far
14:36.040 - 14:41.320:  away from where this market is located there have also been a lot of airstrikes with more civilian
14:41.320 - 14:47.360:  deaths. Will Ross, police and Chile have clashed with demonstrators during a march attended by
14:47.360 - 14:52.860:  President Gabriel Barich on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the military coup led by General
14:52.860 - 14:58.400:  Augusto Pinochet. President Barich blamed a small number of masked activists for the disruption
14:58.400 - 15:03.960:  and said many of those attending the demonstration were relatives of those tortured and killed
15:03.960 - 15:09.440:  during military rule. Here's Leonardo Russia. Police guarding La Moneda presidential
15:09.440 - 15:15.100:  palace in Santiago responded with tear gas and water cannon to protestors who threw stones and
15:15.100 - 15:20.960:  objects at them. Mr. Barich unveiled a plaque at the palace where Chile's first socialist presence,
15:20.960 - 15:28.280:  Salvador Allende died on September 11th 1973. Last month his government announced a plan to
15:28.280 - 15:34.600:  search for more than 1,000 people who disappeared during the Pinochet regime. Some 3,000 people
15:34.600 - 15:41.360:  are killed in the 17 years he was in power. Leonardo Russia. Here in the UK, Manchester University
15:41.360 - 15:46.260:  Museum in the north of England has started the process of handing back dozens of artifacts
15:46.260 - 15:52.220:  belonging to an indigenous community in Australia. The return of these objects is part of a larger
15:52.220 - 15:57.200:  effort by western countries to repatriate artifacts that were taken from former colonies.
15:57.820 - 16:03.200:  The objects in this case were taken from the Anandili Aqua community on an island off the coast
16:03.200 - 16:07.920:  of Australia. Beth Timmins watched the handing back ceremony in northern England.
16:14.620 - 16:20.700:  That's the song of Yarnum and Malia, Ayankidaba, Lagua, playing at the University of Manchester's
16:20.700 - 16:26.680:  Museum. It's about 14 clans and is sung by aunties from the Aboriginal and Andandili Aqua community,
16:26.680 - 16:36.840:  celebrating the return of 174 artifacts. Across the world, request for cultural heritage required
16:36.840 - 16:42.600:  during colonial periods, a gaining momentum. And this collection, traded and bought by sociologist
16:42.600 - 16:47.660:  Professor Peter Werslin in the early 50s, will now be returned to its rightful owners in
16:47.660 - 16:53.160:  Groot Island off the coast of Australia's northern territory, one of whom Elder Danjabana
16:53.580 - 17:10.240:  Lelara was tearful as she thanked those at the ceremony. The Werslin collection includes
17:10.240 - 17:15.400:  fishing spares, boomerangs and shell dolls, painted with totemic designs to represent
17:15.400 - 17:20.580:  Mamarika and Borough clans. I spoke to delegates from the Anandili Aqua community,
17:20.640 - 17:27.040:  Nolan and Macy Lelara and Amathia Mamarika. I'm so proud of my people. It's been a wonderful
17:27.060 - 17:35.060:  journey for me on the way to Manchester and I hope you guys also from around the world. I hope
17:35.060 - 17:42.380:  you're also happy about your artifacts have been returned. And why is it important for you to have
17:42.440 - 17:49.800:  these shells and the other 174 objects? The artifacts are going back home and you want to give
17:49.800 - 17:55.400:  the knowledge and skills to our future leaders. It's not only a shell, it's got meanings and stories
17:55.400 - 18:00.900:  about the door shells and it's very important to us. On the table there are some shells that are
18:00.900 - 18:06.160:  about as big as my finger. Some of them are wrapped in parts of fabric which have been hand-painted
18:06.160 - 18:11.180:  with ochre, some of them are smaller and they represent the children and some of the shells look
18:11.180 - 18:16.400:  like they've been wrapped with string, they're beautiful colours and designs and no one's being
18:16.400 - 18:22.160:  allowed to film or photograph what's on the table because of its importance in the ceremony today.
18:22.920 - 18:28.480:  After a grueling four flights over three days this part of an Anandili Aqua heritage will be back
18:28.480 - 18:33.940:  in Groot Island where Amathia told me her grandmother had played with them half a century ago.
18:34.320 - 18:41.140:  All these things we bring in back home because it's got a dream time stories in it, our history,
18:41.260 - 18:50.140:  it's got everything on it, our toe terms, so well we need these things, our ancestors all
18:50.140 - 18:58.080:  in time to bring them back to our country, fair our future to keep on doing it, to make it a life.
19:03.980 - 19:06.080:  That report by Beth Timmons.
19:06.220 - 19:07.600:  Still to come?
19:10.120 - 19:15.080:  Running is what saved me and it is very emotional because I guess you know I have to just
19:15.120 - 19:18.380:  gone and join myself now, have my family and have my kids.

20:05.860 - 20:10.260:  Unexpected Elements is the podcast that sits through the week's news to unearth
20:10.620 - 20:12.120:  surprising nuggets of science.
20:12.460 - 20:15.520:  I really wanted to look at an animal that as far as we could tell at least
20:15.740 - 20:16.780:  doesn't seem to age.
20:16.980 - 20:18.600:  Okay you have my attention tell me more.
20:18.880 - 20:22.140:  And uncover the unexpected connections between them.
20:22.200 - 20:24.500:  I think now it's a good time to talk about words.
20:24.860 - 20:25.140:  Really?
20:25.400 - 20:25.860:  Words?
20:25.860 - 20:26.620:  Absolutely.
20:27.300 - 20:30.260:  Unexpected Elements from the BBC World Service.
20:30.260 - 20:31.300:  Amazing stuff.
20:31.580 - 20:34.040:  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
20:35.500 - 20:37.420:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
20:38.140 - 20:41.200:  After signing a new strategic partnership with Vietnam,
20:41.200 - 20:46.080:  President Biden has denied that the US is attempting to isolate China.
20:46.900 - 20:52.060:  Mr. Biden made the comments nearly half of century after US forces pulled out of
20:52.060 - 20:55.900:  Vietnam, ending the disastrous Cold War era conflict there.
20:56.540 - 20:59.180:  The Communist leader, Unguyen Thu Chau,
20:59.180 - 21:03.840:  described the two countries as critical partners at a critical time for the world.
21:03.900 - 21:07.880:  From Hanoi, he is our Asia-Pacific correspondent, Noribika.
21:08.320 - 21:12.760:  The United States is forging closer ties with China's Communist neighbour.
21:13.340 - 21:18.960:  Hanoi has upgraded its partnership with Washington to its highest level of diplomatic ties.
21:18.960 - 21:22.180:  A deal the Biden administration has pushed for,
21:22.520 - 21:26.480:  as it tries to counter China's growing influence across the Asia-Pacific.
21:27.140 - 21:31.560:  In the last six months, Mr. Biden has also made packs with Japan, South Korea,
21:31.560 - 21:37.580:  the Philippines, and islands in the Pacific, which Beijing condemned as part of a Cold War mentality.
21:37.740 - 21:39.340:  Are they right, Mr. President?
21:39.640 - 21:41.100:  Is it a danger of a Cold War?
21:41.560 - 21:45.080:  I think we think too much in terms of Cold War terms.
21:45.500 - 21:46.360:  Let's not about that.
21:46.760 - 21:49.780:  It's about generating economic growth and stability
21:50.260 - 21:51.460:  that all parts of the world.
21:51.960 - 21:58.100:  Once one of the world's poorest nations, Vietnam is now one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia,
21:58.580 - 22:00.480:  and the US is offering to help.
22:00.940 - 22:03.800:  Big names, including Google, Microsoft, and Apple,
22:04.080 - 22:07.840:  have all shifted parts of their supply chain here in recent years,
22:07.840 - 22:12.900:  part of a strategy to move more semiconductor manufacturing out of China.
22:13.620 - 22:16.660:  Han-Ai will happily work with Washington to grow its economy,
22:16.660 - 22:21.940:  but will not want to be put in a position where it has to choose the US over China.
22:22.760 - 22:27.120:  Instead, it is likely to try to balance its relationship with both superpowers.
22:28.160 - 22:29.480:  Borobica in Vietnam.
22:30.320 - 22:35.780:  The US and Iran have reached an agreement that will see five detained Americans freed by Tehran
22:35.780 - 22:42.160:  in exchange for several jailed Iranians and eventual access to about $6 billion of frozen
22:42.160 - 22:46.040:  Iranian assets. This comes after two years of negotiations,
22:46.040 - 22:50.080:  and it's latest in a series of high-profile prison swaps,
22:50.320 - 22:54.900:  the Biden administration has negotiated to try to bring home US citizens.
22:55.320 - 22:57.280:  It believes have been wrongly detained.
22:58.040 - 23:00.540:  I put it to our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson,
23:00.540 - 23:03.680:  that the deal would come as a surprise to some.
23:04.080 - 23:05.800:  It all happened in a very surprising way.
23:05.800 - 23:08.400:  There were eight rounds of talks over a long period,
23:08.400 - 23:11.780:  and these involved US and Iranian officials in Doha,
23:12.080 - 23:16.140:  in separate hotels, and it all had to be done by shuttle diplomacy,
23:16.700 - 23:18.320:  because they wouldn't meet in the same room.
23:18.900 - 23:24.820:  And the clincher was the agreement over the $6 billion of Iranian money proceeds
23:24.820 - 23:29.720:  from past Iranian oil sales that were to be paid back to Iran.
23:29.720 - 23:33.540:  Not directly, they go to Qatar from Banks and South Korea,
23:34.140 - 23:36.360:  and they're only to be spent on humanitarian services.
23:36.360 - 23:38.780:  But this could happen as early as next week.
23:38.780 - 23:42.260:  And if it does, then the US prisons in Iran
23:42.260 - 23:46.440:  will be able to fly to Doha and the Iranian prisoners in the US
23:46.440 - 23:49.440:  will also fly there and couldn't go home from there.
23:49.700 - 23:53.500:  So quite a surprise, but it's been a bit of a journey getting there.
23:53.840 - 23:58.160:  And how has this come about, given the fact that US and Iran are bitter adversaries?
23:58.960 - 24:02.740:  Indeed. I mean, they've been locked in long negotiations,
24:02.920 - 24:07.140:  along with some other world powers over the 2015 deal
24:07.180 - 24:11.540:  to give Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program.
24:12.300 - 24:15.600:  That's been ongoing, but has floundered and got pretty much nowhere.
24:16.020 - 24:18.380:  And then there's been at the background to all this,
24:18.380 - 24:23.800:  there's been US concern over Iranian expansionism in the Middle East,
24:23.980 - 24:26.020:  and it considers that still to be right.
24:26.020 - 24:29.880:  So this really is an agreement which is separate to the
24:30.180 - 24:33.560:  odd and going problem, which the US State Department has described,
24:33.560 - 24:37.980:  for instance, diplomatic relations with Iran as one of that not much trust.
24:38.540 - 24:40.420:  So that pretty much says it all, doesn't it?
24:41.020 - 24:44.760:  Mike Thompson. Just last month, the British Foreign Secretary James
24:44.760 - 24:48.800:  cleverly visited China to try to improve deteriorating relations.
24:49.420 - 24:53.040:  But now questions are being asked about whether that was a wise move.
24:53.460 - 24:58.140:  After reports emerged that a parliamentary researcher believed to have linked to several
24:58.140 - 25:00.860:  leading members of the governing conservative party
25:01.280 - 25:05.660:  was arrested back in March on suspicion of spying for China,
25:06.020 - 25:09.560:  along with another man. The British Prime Minister, Rishi Soonak,
25:09.560 - 25:11.820:  who's been attending the G20 summit in India,
25:12.260 - 25:16.260:  said he'd raised the issue with the Chinese Premier Li Chiang.
25:16.680 - 25:21.180:  With regard to my meeting with my Premier Li, what I said very specifically
25:21.260 - 25:26.200:  is that I range a range of different concerns that we have in areas of
25:26.200 - 25:30.360:  disagreement, and in particular my very strong concerns about any interference
25:30.960 - 25:33.260:  in our parliamentary democracy, which is obviously unacceptable.
25:34.200 - 25:38.200:  Our political correspondent, Nick Early, told us more about the two arrests.
25:39.040 - 25:43.400:  Well, officially, the police have confirmed that two men were arrested back in March
25:43.400 - 25:49.520:  under the Official Secrets Act, and our understanding is that one of those men,
25:49.520 - 25:55.660:  who's in his 20s, who's arrested in Edinburgh, is a parliamentary researcher
25:56.260 - 26:00.360:  in the House of Commons, who has links to some pretty senior
26:00.680 - 26:04.300:  conservative MPs in the British Parliament, the chair of the Foreign Affairs
26:04.860 - 26:09.740:  Select Committee in Parliament, a woman called Alicia Kerons, Tom Tuggenhardt,
26:09.740 - 26:13.140:  who's the security minister now, although my understanding is that this was
26:13.140 - 26:19.020:  before he had that senior government job. But it raised those big questions about
26:19.020 - 26:26.100:  the vetting procedures for Parliament about Chinese influence in British society,
26:26.100 - 26:30.500:  and it's reignited this debate that's been going on for ages, actually, in the UK,
26:31.120 - 26:33.880:  about what the government's approach to China should be.
26:34.340 - 26:37.940:  Because we had the British Foreign Secretary in China just last month,
26:38.740 - 26:41.560:  trying to re-engage after years of deteriorating relations,
26:42.360 - 26:45.360:  and now this has been taken so seriously that the Prime Minister,
26:46.580 - 26:50.800:  has been speaking to the Chinese Premier and the sidelines of the G20 summit about this.
26:50.800 - 26:56.260:  But some will say, is that enough? I think you're absolutely right, and when you speak to
26:56.260 - 27:00.180:  those conservative MPs who have concerns about the government's approach to China,
27:00.700 - 27:05.360:  they point to that visit from the Foreign Secretary the first in five years
27:06.320 - 27:12.300:  last month, and they say, why is that happening? If at the same time we have real concerns that
27:12.300 - 27:20.760:  Chinese actors are infiltrating the UK Parliament. The argument you hear from ministers in
27:20.760 - 27:26.880:  the UK government is, well, look, we can't ignore China. It's a hugely important economy and
27:26.880 - 27:31.860:  geopolitical player, and we need to have those relations, particularly when it comes to some of
27:31.860 - 27:37.300:  those debates over things like Ukraine. But there are an increasing number of conservative MPs,
27:37.300 - 27:41.920:  some of who have been sanctioned by China, who say, it just doesn't enough, and we need to take
27:41.920 - 27:46.100:  a much stricter approach. Especially given the fact, this isn't the first time they have been such
27:46.100 - 27:52.820:  accusations of Chinese interference. No, MI5, the spy agency in the UK, took a pretty unprecedented
27:52.820 - 27:58.180:  step when it named a woman a few years ago and said that she had strong links to the Chinese
27:58.180 - 28:03.820:  Communist Party. She'd been denating to some British politicians, including a prominent Labour MP,
28:04.100 - 28:09.240:  Labour the New Opposition Party, that led to a number of questions about Chinese influence.
28:09.240 - 28:14.960:  And speaking to members of Parliament today, I think the main concern a lot of them have is
28:15.340 - 28:21.260:  that this is still happening, that after that case a few years ago, this hasn't been fully dealt with.
28:22.200 - 28:29.040:  Nicodely, one of Britain's greatest athletes, Mo Farrer, has completed his final competitive race,
28:29.380 - 28:35.800:  saying afterwards that it was very emotional and that running is all I know. The 40-year-old,
28:35.800 - 28:41.620:  who's won four Olympic gold medals, finished fourth in the so-called Great North Run in Northern
28:41.620 - 28:48.020:  England. Tens of thousands of other runners also took part in the half marathon. Joe Wilson was watching.
28:52.140 - 28:57.080:  From Newcastle to South Shields, the Great North Run is the biggest event of its kind in Britain.
28:57.520 - 29:01.960:  Some 60,000 participants started on a day too hot to be comfortable.
29:01.960 - 29:07.820:  Some Mo Farrer led the elite race for a couple of miles. That urge to win remains after a career
29:07.820 - 29:13.280:  of 10 global gold medals on the track. He's now 40 and those victories elude him.
29:13.600 - 29:19.320:  But he completed this half marathon, waving to spectators and high-fiving hands. His position
29:19.320 - 29:24.940:  was fourth and his status finished. That suddenly seemed like a lot to take in.
29:25.580 - 29:30.760:  Run is what saved me and without having something to do and that's something that could make me happy,
29:30.980 - 29:34.900:  it would have been very difficult for me. It is very emotional because I guess, you know,
29:35.340 - 29:39.460:  I have to just gone and join myself now. It's happened with my family and my kids.
29:40.440 - 29:44.660:  But all I know is running and that's what made me happy for so many years.
29:44.900 - 29:49.700:  He may no longer compete to win but of course some Mo Farrer can still run. Tens of thousands
29:49.700 - 29:54.400:  had their own compelling reasons to do just that at the Great North Run.
29:55.660 - 29:58.180:  Joe Wilson. Now, have a listen to this.
30:03.320 - 30:08.240:  That's the sound of the rare European bison grazing. It lives in Europe's last
30:08.240 - 30:12.720:  primeval forest, the Alevice, which lies on the border between Poland and Belarus.
30:13.320 - 30:18.780:  It's a world heritage site and it's an immersive experience rich with all kinds of bird song and
30:18.780 - 30:24.580:  animal sounds. One woman has made it her mission to record as many of them as possible.
30:25.200 - 30:29.200:  She's a blind Polish field sound recordist Isabella Duoszik.
30:30.020 - 30:34.600:  Julian Warica spoke to Isabella who's in Gdansk and asked her about her recordings.
30:40.100 - 30:47.360:  When I, for instance, choose some soundscapes to record, what is most important for me is
30:47.360 - 30:57.120:  simply enjoyment of the sound. So this is why I choose soundscapes that are poetic or lyrical.
30:57.740 - 31:02.300:  There is one recording of filled crickets and 19 gills, fresh 19 gills.
31:07.280 - 31:14.140:  And this is something extraordinary because I did not focus on the birds themselves
31:15.300 - 31:19.200:  but I chose the opposite side to capture the echo.
31:19.700 - 31:23.000:  We'll hear some of the sounds that you've particularly selected as we talk.
31:23.020 - 31:30.100:  There is different breeds of bird, I think feature quite heavily. How much of an important part
31:30.100 - 31:36.300:  are they all as you walk through this this woodland? How much are you hearing them? How much do they
31:36.300 - 31:42.860:  change your experience when you're there? Sometimes it is so extraordinary. For instance, the
31:43.080 - 31:48.160:  the soundscape of the kuku, the golden aurils and the grits for the woodpecker.
31:59.000 - 32:05.560:  Each of these species has a very special sound, a very beautiful sound,
32:06.240 - 32:12.580:  really fortunate to hear them all at once. So I think that when we talk about the experience
32:13.320 - 32:20.420:  of listening all depends on very subtle moments that I have while walking.
32:20.760 - 32:25.260:  Tell me about the recording process. Is it literally just you and a tape recorder?
32:25.260 - 32:33.000:  How does it work? I need a person to guide me because I am blind so I cannot visit such places
32:34.140 - 32:40.000:  and usually the people who assist me is my family, especially my mother. But when it comes to
32:40.280 - 32:48.400:  the process of recording itself, yes I would say that this is me and the microphone. I have two
32:48.400 - 32:55.100:  types of microphones. One is intended for soundscape recording and I have also a second microphone
32:55.980 - 33:02.140:  that is intended more for recording with a parabolic dish. So when I want to record
33:02.220 - 33:08.300:  some soundscapes in which I cannot be present for instance because birds or other animals
33:08.300 - 33:16.860:  because I do not record birds only will be disturbed or might be frightened. I leave the microphone,
33:16.860 - 33:23.440:  this terrific microphone on the tripod and it's records by itself. This is how I recorded the
33:30.560 - 33:36.200:  great night. Tell me about the current situation because you've got a radio programed. You have
33:36.200 - 33:42.040:  an album that you have made out of your recordings. What's been the reaction to all of that?
33:42.920 - 33:50.320:  I was had a presentation of my recordings from Peru. In the Amazon jungle in Peru or whereabouts
33:50.320 - 33:58.300:  in the country. Yes in the Amazon jungle and one person went up to me and said that she
33:59.060 - 34:06.520:  lived there for some time and for her it is a recollection of her childhood and this is something
34:06.520 - 34:13.840:  that is most important to me because I think that listening is something that may open us to our
34:14.680 - 34:21.620:  inner way of experiencing the world. The music of nature, the sounds of nature are perhaps the most
34:21.620 - 34:29.920:  gentle sounds we can ever hear regardless of our opinions, political preferences. Nature is
34:29.920 - 34:33.680:  accepting for all of us and this is something that we need I think.
34:38.540 - 34:42.700:  That was the field sound recordist Isabella Dorzik in Poland.
34:45.580 - 34:50.160:  And that's all for us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
34:50.380 - 34:54.320:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered you can send us an email.

35:12.880 - 35:14.060:  Until next time, goodbye.
