01:34.780 - 01:38.100:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:40.860 - 01:44.560:  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 13th of September,
01:44.560 - 01:45.920:  these are our main stories.
01:46.420 - 01:51.100:  Rescue teams are facing a huge challenge to deliver aid to parts of eastern Libya
01:51.100 - 01:52.780:  hit by catastrophic floods.
01:53.620 - 01:58.340:  The US House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, has ordered an impeachment inquiry into President Biden.
01:59.140 - 02:04.000:  The former World No. 1 tennis star, Simona Hallett, has been banned for four years
02:04.220 - 02:05.980:  for breaching anti-doping rules.
02:09.640 - 02:11.900:  Also in this podcast, it's back.
02:12.680 - 02:16.540:  It took 1,300 days, but here it is.
02:16.860 - 02:20.640:  And I will hand it over in a few moments to the museum director.
02:21.520 - 02:25.700:  A stolen vanguard painting is recovered by an art detective.
02:30.800 - 02:34.900:  Libya, a country that's already been devastated by a decade of conflict,
02:34.900 - 02:37.380:  is now dealing with another disaster.
02:37.960 - 02:42.940:  A powerful storm has burst dams, triggering floods that have swept away buildings and cars
02:42.940 - 02:46.640:  and killed more than 2,000 people in the east of the country.
02:47.240 - 02:51.260:  The floods around the port city of D端rner have been likened to a tsunami,
02:51.960 - 02:58.660:  and with at least 10,000 more people missing, it's feared that the number of dead will rise much higher.
02:59.440 - 03:04.140:  Hisham Chikouat is an eastern government minister who visited D端rner, a quarter of which
03:04.420 - 03:08.700:  has been wiped out and where more than 1,000 bodies have been recovered.
03:16.140 - 03:20.780:  Increasing each hour, it's a calamity by all means.
03:21.220 - 03:24.980:  We were there yesterday, we were shocked by the view.
03:24.980 - 03:26.500:  I mean, it's tsunami.
03:26.800 - 03:28.720:  I symbolize that, you know, it's tsunami.
03:29.960 - 03:33.160:  The Libyan journalist, Nora Eljerbi, who lives in Tunis,
03:33.520 - 03:38.760:  has 35 family members who were all living in the same apartment building in D端rner.
03:39.240 - 03:41.980:  I couldn't reach them for around 48 hours,
03:42.180 - 03:44.260:  and even now I didn't reach them.
03:44.260 - 03:48.580:  I reached out to the rescue team where they went to the place and they checked.
03:48.580 - 03:54.120:  The house has been destroyed, but my family managed to get out before things get worse.
03:54.600 - 03:56.300:  They are safe now, as I told.
03:56.300 - 03:58.040:  I've been here from them directly.
03:58.080 - 04:01.580:  They are in a shelter place, but they are in shortage of food.
04:01.580 - 04:03.520:  They are in shortage of medical aids.
04:03.520 - 04:07.860:  They are in shortage of clothes, and the situation is not very the best,
04:07.960 - 04:09.600:  but at least they are still alive.
04:09.600 - 04:12.300:  I have one aunt who's still missing with her son.
04:12.300 - 04:14.360:  We don't have any news about her.
04:14.400 - 04:16.000:  She lives in another different building,
04:16.000 - 04:21.560:  and we still couldn't reach out to her or even get any news about her.
04:22.000 - 04:25.640:  AIDS supplies have been flown into eastern Libya from Egypt and Turkey,
04:25.640 - 04:27.560:  and other countries are rushing to help.
04:27.560 - 04:32.120:  But the scale of the challenge in this divided nation is huge.
04:32.780 - 04:36.000:  Our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson, gave us this update.
04:36.460 - 04:39.600:  The latest development is what you mentioned there about aid arriving,
04:39.660 - 04:44.780:  and it must be such an enormous relief to the person we just heard from there
04:44.780 - 04:47.720:  with her family, so many members of the family in the same block.
04:47.720 - 04:51.280:  And up to now, there's been no help that could get to people.
04:51.540 - 04:53.500:  It still hasn't arrived with anybody,
04:53.760 - 04:56.340:  but at least it's in the country, Turkish and Egyptian help.
04:56.440 - 05:00.180:  There's been a big pledge from the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.
05:00.260 - 05:05.220:  It's pledged more than $400 million to help rebuild D端rner in Benghazi,
05:05.240 - 05:07.100:  and the UN is mobilising on the ground.
05:07.220 - 05:10.820:  So, at least, although there's utter chaos and terrible destruction,
05:11.500 - 05:14.420:  help is there. It is starting to trickle through.
05:14.940 - 05:18.220:  And you've touched on it there, that there is this division in Libya
05:18.220 - 05:21.820:  between different administrations, which must be complicating the aid effort.
05:22.380 - 05:25.400:  Absolutely, Janet. Yes, I mean, you've got two governments.
05:25.400 - 05:29.240:  One in the East, the government in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in Benghazi,
05:29.240 - 05:32.680:  then you've got the government in the West, the internationally recognised government,
05:32.680 - 05:34.440:  and there are two rival institutions.
05:34.440 - 05:40.360:  There's two prime ministers in the country, and there's constant infighting between them,
05:40.360 - 05:43.560:  and when an election was due to be held at the end of 2021,
05:43.660 - 05:46.680:  which could have brought unity in a unified government,
05:46.680 - 05:49.820:  no one could agree on who was eligible to stand,
05:50.020 - 05:52.480:  and, and the rules of the elections, so that never happened.
05:52.820 - 05:54.620:  So, you can just imagine with all that,
05:55.500 - 05:58.580:  trying to coordinate actions is going to be very difficult,
05:58.580 - 06:02.860:  although I do sense that there's a, there's the spirit there to definitely try on,
06:03.040 - 06:04.260:  on both ends of the country.
06:04.660 - 06:07.740:  Because, perhaps, given the huge scale of this tragedy,
06:07.740 - 06:11.880:  this could be an opportunity for it to help reunite Libyans.
06:12.080 - 06:15.240:  Indeed, that's true, because we've seen already this,
06:15.540 - 06:19.300:  donation I mentioned is 400 million from the, from the West to the East,
06:19.600 - 06:27.760:  and yesterday the administration in Tripoli talked of the unity of all Libyans in this crisis.
06:28.280 - 06:35.320:  So, you know, maybe a terrible event like this could actually help bring some kind of togetherness
06:35.360 - 06:37.280:  to this long divided country.
06:37.940 - 06:41.180:  Mike Thompson. Next to Morocco, and hopes are fading,
06:41.180 - 06:44.420:  are finding earthquake survivors in the remote Atlas Nantens,
06:44.420 - 06:47.800:  as rescue efforts are now continuing into their fifth day.
06:48.320 - 06:51.260:  With nearly 3,000 people now known to have died,
06:51.260 - 06:56.440:  the government has been criticised for only accepting help from a handful of countries,
06:56.980 - 07:00.240:  and ignoring offers from others like France or Algeria.
07:00.680 - 07:02.200:  The French President, Emmanuel Macron,
07:02.880 - 07:06.480:  addressed the Moroccan public about Friday's earthquake in a video message.
07:07.100 - 07:10.520:  He said that Paris was ready to provide help in the recovery
07:10.520 - 07:13.540:  if King Mohammed VI accepted France's offer.
07:14.200 - 07:18.260:  For now, it's ordinary Moroccans who are providing most of the help.
07:18.960 - 07:23.800:  Karin Toby said this report from one of the many villages destroyed by the quake.
07:24.600 - 07:26.580:  This is the village of the Wartarca.
07:27.080 - 07:29.440:  There were about 100 homes here.
07:30.140 - 07:34.020:  People have been digging through the rubble since the deadly earthquake hit on Friday.
07:35.320 - 07:40.660:  Now that the rescue teams have arrived, the search continues for any bodies.
07:41.440 - 07:46.400:  Days after the earthquake, there is no more hope to find any survivors in this village.
07:46.400 - 07:52.600:  Threscuers are looking for three bodies, a grandfather, a father, and a toddler.
07:53.320 - 07:55.860:  They are doing so with their bare hands.
07:56.700 - 08:01.200:  This is also how Adab de la Sainte searched for his wife, son, and daughter,
08:01.900 - 08:05.480:  whose bodies he recovered hours after the earthquake hit.
08:09.840 - 08:14.160:  My wife was here. There was my daughter. She was like this.
08:14.960 - 08:20.500:  And over there, my son. I dug with my own hands and with the help of some people here,
08:20.500 - 08:25.900:  we pulled the bodies out. I lost my children. I lost everything.
08:26.720 - 08:30.300:  I appealed for the authorities and his majesty, the king, to help me.
08:30.960 - 08:33.020:  Me, they rest in peace. Amen.
08:33.960 - 08:38.460:  The only people trapped under the rubble who survived were those rescued by the villagers.
08:39.300 - 08:40.960:  The night, the earthquakes struck.
08:43.980 - 08:49.340:  There were five of us. We went from one home to another, calling the residents by name,
08:49.920 - 08:50.880:  from door to door.
08:53.980 - 08:56.840:  We only focused on the houses from which people answered,
08:57.380 - 09:01.180:  where we didn't get a reply, we moved on. We had to.
09:02.200 - 09:05.440:  Residents of the town are now refugees living on the road.
09:06.400 - 09:09.800:  During the day, they take shelter from the sun in the shade of a tree,
09:10.320 - 09:16.960:  or under a makeshift tent. But at night, the bitter cold reminds them that winter is coming,
09:17.780 - 09:19.620:  and they have no shelter.
09:44.500 - 09:46.340:  The American people deserve to know.
09:47.140 - 09:49.400:  That the public offices are not for sale.
09:50.400 - 09:56.220:  And that the federal government is not being used to cover up the actions of a politically
09:57.620 - 10:02.460:  associated family. Now, I would encourage the president and his team to fully cooperate
10:03.500 - 10:06.700:  with this investigation and the interests of transparency.
10:07.900 - 10:12.920:  Mr. McCarthy has been under pressure from far-right members of his own party to open impeachment
10:12.920 - 10:17.580:  proceedings. The White House has dismissed the Republicans' push for an investigation
10:17.580 - 10:23.460:  as baseless and politically motivated. My colleague, Evan Davis, spoke to our Washington
10:23.460 - 10:27.600:  correspondent, Sean Dilly, and asked him what the claims are against President Biden,
10:27.600 - 10:30.320:  especially in relation to his son, Hunter.
10:30.820 - 10:35.940:  These largely revolve around Ukraine, where Hunter Biden, the president's son,
10:35.980 - 10:41.620:  was working for an energy company, Erismas. Republicans have suggested for some time
10:41.620 - 10:47.100:  that Joe Biden was involved in those business dealings at a time when Joe Biden was Vice
10:47.100 - 10:53.780:  President to Barack Obama at a time where Joe Biden had a role in tackling corruption within
10:53.780 - 10:59.000:  the Ukrainian system. This has always been denied fervently by Joe Biden. But Kevin McCarthy,
10:59.000 - 11:04.740:  the Republican Speaker of the House, has essentially pointed to three committees, the oversight,
11:04.740 - 11:10.740:  judiciary, and the ways and means, saying that he is now directing, rather than what had been
11:10.740 - 11:17.560:  expected to seek a vote of 218 Republican Party members, directing an impeachment inquiry.
11:17.560 - 11:21.640:  Now, it's really important to bear in mind the context here is there have been three attempts
11:21.640 - 11:28.100:  to impeach presidents in 1868, President Johnson, Bill Clinton in 1998. Donald Trump was impeached
11:28.100 - 11:34.100:  twice, but as it needs a two-thirds majority of the uphouse the Senate, it's rather academic
11:34.100 - 11:38.620:  because it's a 51-49 Democratic Party majority in that upper house.
11:38.880 - 11:42.900:  Let's go through this. This is actually not going to get anywhere, is the conclusion of that.
11:42.940 - 11:48.780:  But is it going to absorb a lot of bandwidth and American politics over the next weeks and
11:48.780 - 11:53.500:  months? Yes, potentially. The context, it's really important to understand this, is both parties,
11:53.500 - 11:59.020:  Democratic Party and the Republicans are accusing the other of weaponizing institutions
11:59.260 - 12:04.480:  in Donald Trump's cases, supporters of the former president will say that Joe Biden has caused
12:05.000 - 12:10.360:  the Department of Justice to indict him over serious allegations. That doesn't quite stack up,
12:10.360 - 12:14.480:  of course, because he's also been indicted in New York and in Georgia. These are state authorities,
12:15.040 - 12:20.460:  not the Department of Justice. In this case, Kevin McCarthy has a reputation of speaking out,
12:20.460 - 12:25.960:  both in favor of Donald Trump. He's very much on the right of the Republican Party and against
12:25.980 - 12:32.540:  Joe Biden. He's been hinting that he would like an impeachment inquiry for some time and looking
12:32.540 - 12:36.580:  at these kind of three committees that have been subcommittees that have been investigating things.
12:37.000 - 12:41.600:  By the concession of these committees, there really isn't anything to conclusively suggest there
12:41.600 - 12:46.500:  is actually any evidence. The arguments on the part of the Republican Party members who advocate
12:46.500 - 12:51.880:  this is simply that there should be an inquiry now to hear that evidence. Sean Dilly,
12:52.720 - 12:56.600:  when you go to look for information on the internet, which search engine do you use?
12:56.600 - 13:02.580:  For almost all of us, it will be Google. But how did it achieve this overwhelming dominance?
13:02.600 - 13:06.980:  That's at the heart of a major court case which began on Tuesday in Washington,
13:06.980 - 13:12.960:  in which the US government has taken on the tech giant, accusing it of abusing its power and
13:12.960 - 13:18.060:  stifling competition to secure its position as the world's go-to search engine.
13:18.840 - 13:23.880:  If the US Department of Justice wins its case, it could transform not just Google, but the whole
13:23.880 - 13:28.840:  big tech sector. A correspondent Namia Eggball attended the trial in Washington,
13:28.960 - 13:35.880:  so the first big monopoly case of the tech era. It's the first one in decades. The last time
13:35.900 - 13:41.420:  this happened was in the late 90s concerning the internet explorer for Microsoft. It's worth
13:41.420 - 13:46.660:  mentioning that this is a bypass as an issue. So many US governments, including Donald Trump's
13:46.660 - 13:52.580:  and our President Biden's government, have tried to reign in big tech and so this is a big test
13:52.860 - 13:57.240:  for them. As you mentioned there at the heart of it, is how did Google become so big? Well,
13:57.240 - 14:02.140:  the claim that the Department of Justice is making is that Google illegally used its market muscle
14:02.140 - 14:08.520:  to stifle the competition and restrict choices for people. They claim they've done that by making
14:08.520 - 14:12.640:  deals with companies like Apple and Samsung, so that basically when you go on your mobile phone
14:12.640 - 14:16.340:  and when you go on your tablet, you've kind of got no option but to use Google, and that means
14:16.340 - 14:22.420:  no one else has a chance, like Microsoft, Bing or Duck Duck Go. In court, the Department of Justice
14:22.420 - 14:27.800:  used some pretty astonishing figures. According to a data analysis firm, Google has a mass
14:27.800 - 14:34.700:  90% of the search engine market here in the US and 91% globally. Google is defending itself
14:34.700 - 14:38.760:  of course, and we've been here in the opening statements today saying that these deals with these
14:38.760 - 14:44.000:  companies were not exclusive. Users can change the default settings if they want and if they don't,
14:44.000 - 14:50.040:  it's because Google offers the best kind of search results compared to other search engines,
14:50.200 - 14:55.000:  and also Google is saying, looking at wider context, we are competing with Amazon and TikTok
14:55.000 - 15:00.080:  and other platforms, so they don't believe that this 90% figure is true. It's going to be a very
15:00.080 - 15:04.440:  long trial and it's going to be a pretty messy one as well. And if Google have found guilty,
15:04.660 - 15:09.060:  what could the consequences be? Well, that's what's at stake really here because it's serious
15:09.060 - 15:13.820:  business. Google could end up having to restructure, could pay damages, Google might not be the main
15:13.820 - 15:18.940:  default engine, search engine that we have. I mentioned there the Microsoft case back in late 90s,
15:19.240 - 15:25.240:  and Microsoft essentially broke up into two and it allowed the emergence of other big tech,
15:25.500 - 15:30.720:  like Google, so it's all very ironic. The cyclist repeating itself, and I think what it would be
15:30.720 - 15:35.000:  is proof that the government can take on tech giants in these big anti-trust cases.
15:36.140 - 15:41.580:  Nomiya Ikbal, in a surprise move, the energy company BP has announced that its chief executive,
15:41.580 - 15:47.240:  Bernard Looney, has stepped down after failing to disclose past personal relationships with colleagues.
15:47.920 - 15:53.100:  Mr Looney has led BP since 2020. Here's our business editor, Simon Jack.
15:53.640 - 15:57.580:  This is a bombshell announcement at the very top of one of Britain's biggest business
15:58.140 - 16:03.200:  and most globally recognised businesses. Bernard Looney has been at BP all of his professional
16:03.200 - 16:08.520:  life since the early 90s. What's emerged is that in May of last year, an anonymous source
16:08.520 - 16:12.860:  informed the board about allegations about his personal conduct with colleagues.
16:12.860 - 16:17.680:  Now, the board looked into that. At the time, Mr Looney admitted he'd had a small number
16:18.120 - 16:22.440:  of personal relationships. They looked into that and found there had been no breach of their
16:22.440 - 16:27.820:  company's conduct. However, in the last couple of days, it's emerged that very recent allegations
16:27.820 - 16:33.420:  of a similar nature have emerged and Mr Looney has admitted that he wasn't fully transparent
16:33.420 - 16:39.740:  with the board at the time of that first review and so he has resigned with a median effect.
16:39.900 - 16:44.580:  Now, he has been credited with putting BP on a course to a greener future, although
16:44.580 - 16:49.380:  criticised in some quarters for dialing down those ambitions at the same time making enormous
16:49.380 - 16:54.520:  profits here. But of course, it's not the first high profile dismissal we've seen at a time
16:54.520 - 16:59.960:  where there has been increased and some would say overdue scrutiny of senior executives'
16:59.960 - 17:05.580:  relationships in the workplace. Simon Jack. A Dutch art detective, nicknamed the
17:05.580 - 17:10.340:  Indiana Jones of the Art World, has recovered a painting by Vincent Bangok which was stolen
17:10.340 - 17:15.480:  over three years ago from a museum in the Netherlands while it was closed during the Covid pandemic.
17:16.200 - 17:20.800:  Arthur Brand worked with the police to negotiate the safe return of the 19th century painting
17:20.800 - 17:26.660:  worth millions of dollars whose whereabouts had been a mystery until now. He said it was one of
17:26.660 - 17:32.760:  the greatest moments of his life. Paul Moss reports. It wasn't the most sophisticated crime,
17:32.760 - 17:38.560:  the thief used a sledgehammer to smash through the glass doors at the Singularum Museum near Amsterdam
17:38.560 - 17:44.380:  and ran off with the painting under his arm. A man known as Nils M was arrested and subsequently
17:44.380 - 17:50.820:  convicted of the theft, but nobody knew where the picture had gone until now. Arthur Brand is a
17:50.820 - 17:56.620:  self-styled art detective with a track record of recovering missing works. He was contacted by
17:56.620 - 18:02.520:  a man who he says wanted to hand over the painting because apparently it was a headache to hold
18:02.520 - 18:09.180:  on to. Shortly afterwards it was delivered to Mr Brand, covered in bubble wrap he says and carried
18:09.180 - 18:13.840:  in a blue Ikea bag. He posted a video on social media shortly afterwards.
18:14.360 - 18:19.080:  Stolen three and a half years ago, on Fengar's birthday it's one of the early works by Fengar,
18:19.820 - 18:28.620:  it's back. It took 1,300 days, but here it is and I will hand it over in a few moments to the museum
18:28.620 - 18:34.320:  director. The museum says pass anage garden at noon and in spring will go back on public display
18:34.320 - 18:40.900:  next year, but history suggests it won't be the last Fengar's painting to go missing. 28 have
18:40.900 - 18:46.500:  been stolen and then recovered over the past few decades, an unusual but perhaps rather direct
18:46.500 - 18:54.160:  form of complement to the Netherlands's most famous artist. Paul Moss. Still to come?
18:55.060 - 19:00.260:  I didn't get spat on at the start, this bird has a really good aim in it, spat on my first
19:00.260 - 19:05.920:  ride in the cheek. This might coming under attack from an unfriendly seabird, a 7-year-old boy
19:05.920 - 19:09.780:  has successfully climbed one of the UK's tallest sea steaks.
19:17.400 - 19:24.020:  From hedge funds to angel investors to bull markets. In the world of finance, names can sometimes
19:24.020 - 19:31.540:  be a bit misleading. Take ours for instance. Alsegg, aka London Stock Exchange Group. We're in

19:43.240 - 19:46.020:  but not everything we do. Alsegg.
19:51.480 - 19:57.300:  Heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires, catastrophic consequences from climate change.
19:57.300 - 20:01.700:  What's going on is this real. The climate question is the podcast exploring our
20:01.700 - 20:06.520:  planet's changing environment and what we're doing across the world to adapt and respond to it.
20:06.520 - 20:10.940:  The future is ahead of us, a very sensitive to the choices that make today.
20:10.940 - 20:13.580:  If we don't start fixing it, we're going to move victims of it.
20:13.580 - 20:17.220:  Can't engage. The climate question from the BBC World Service,

20:20.780 - 20:26.600:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The United Nations is warning of a new crisis in Bosnia,
20:26.600 - 20:30.780:  three decades after the war that followed the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
20:31.460 - 20:37.180:  The Bosnian Serbs, who launched the original war in 1992, are threatening to succeed from the
20:37.180 - 20:42.800:  country. And these threats have increased in the past couple of years after the UN appointed
20:42.800 - 20:46.800:  high representative, the International Official in charge of monitoring the peace,
20:47.100 - 20:53.320:  banned genocide denial. This was in response to Bosnian Serb leaders' persistence in describing
20:53.320 - 21:00.100:  as a myth, the genocide of 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Ceberanica in 1995.
21:00.960 - 21:06.440:  Our special correspondent, Virgo Keen, reports from Bosnia on how the struggle over the past
21:06.920 - 21:09.040:  is threatening the stability of the present.
21:11.840 - 21:19.320:  I've come into a warehouse in Tuzla, Bosnia and I'm walking past row upon row of steel shelves.
21:20.660 - 21:28.680:  And on these are placed white canvas bags, which contain skeletal remains of people who
21:28.680 - 21:31.960:  were murdered during the genocide, and above them brown paper bags,
21:33.340 - 21:38.900:  in which are placed the belongings, which have been found in different mass graves.
21:38.900 - 21:41.980:  One name crops up again and again, Strebrenica.
21:43.500 - 21:47.680:  I am Bragana Vultudic, senior forensic anthropologist. I've worked for International
21:47.680 - 21:53.000:  Commission on Missing Persons. 80% of the missing from Serbians have been found so far,
21:53.100 - 22:00.960:  but still we have to do a lot. 1,000 people is still a lot, and 1,000 families wait for our phone call.
22:02.240 - 22:06.660:  Identifying remains and connecting them with living relatives is the primary task,
22:07.380 - 22:08.900:  but there is another imperative.
22:09.760 - 22:16.360:  Bragana is Serbian and believes her own people in Serbia and Bosnia must face the truth of the past.
22:16.940 - 22:23.600:  I think it is very important for society that we need to face with the past and we need to find out
22:23.600 - 22:28.620:  what really happened in the 90s in this region to change our history.
22:30.000 - 22:36.100:  Bosnia has many sites which are infamous in the history of genocide, but none perhaps more
22:36.960 - 22:41.720:  than here at Serbrenica. I've come to meet a survivor of the Serbrenica genocide,
22:42.780 - 22:47.780:  a man who's devoting his life to fighting, lies, and denial.
22:49.660 - 22:53.820:  I'm at Najad Avdic standing amid the white memorial stones to the dead
22:53.820 - 23:00.480:  at the Serbrenica cemetery, among them his father and grandfather. Why do you stay here?
23:01.440 - 23:05.680:  After everything that's happened, given the the threat that exists now, why do you stay here?
23:06.040 - 23:10.760:  Living here, struggling here against that, that is therapy for me here.
23:10.760 - 23:16.840:  Maybe for you, it is history, but living here is a struggle on a daily basis against that.
23:16.960 - 23:23.040:  Against denial. Against denial and against everything, against the glorification of our criminals, against everything.
23:25.640 - 23:30.200:  But now the Serb extremist leaders responsible, rather than carriageic and general
23:30.460 - 23:36.900:  are being celebrated by current Serb leaders like Miller Adodic, president of the semi-autonomous
23:36.900 - 23:44.500:  republic of Serbska. We must remember these men and keep our memory of them, regardless
23:44.500 - 23:47.620:  of whether they tell us we are glorifying, says Dodic.
23:51.740 - 23:57.180:  I'm about 15 miles outside the town of Sokolats in the heart of the republic of Serbska,
23:58.040 - 24:06.360:  and this is how can I describe it except a carnival of Serb nationalism. It's a night when
24:07.300 - 24:10.000:  hundreds of young people from the surrounding area have come out.
24:12.360 - 24:18.900:  I'm at General Vinko Panduravic at the nearby memorial to local Serbs, among them family members,
24:19.360 - 24:25.600:  killed in the war. He served 10 years in a UN jail for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity
24:25.600 - 24:31.080:  at Srebrenica. He failed to stop atrocities and punish the soldiers responsible.
24:32.200 - 24:36.860:  Like other prominent Bosnian Serbs, he won't call what happened in Srebrenica genocide,
24:37.720 - 24:40.680:  instead a massacre for which he wasn't responsible.
24:41.540 - 24:48.300:  How on earth can your conscience be clear when you've been convicted of crimes against humanity
24:49.120 - 24:51.080:  in an atrocity like Srebrenica?
24:55.340 - 25:00.320:  A person just has to accept the things as they are. If you cannot change them,
25:00.360 - 25:06.540:  then let it be. This thing I cannot change. I accept that it exists. I live with it.
25:07.960 - 25:15.080:  It's a warm summer afternoon here in Sarajevo. Just to my right is the Suad and Olga Bridge,
25:15.140 - 25:21.440:  named after two women who were shot by Serb snipers at the very beginning of the conflict in 1992.
25:22.940 - 25:31.020:  Talk to anybody who lived through that period and you realize that normality is simply a veneer.
25:32.220 - 25:37.800:  They are haunted not just by what happened in the past, but about the rhetoric of the present.
25:38.620 - 25:43.140:  Elmana Mimisavic is a professor of law at the University of Sarajevo.
25:44.040 - 25:48.580:  Her father, grandfather and grandmother were all killed during the conflict.
25:49.280 - 25:55.980:  It's very dangerous, especially for the survivors of genocide. Everything looks very familiar.
25:56.340 - 26:04.040:  The dehumanization, the celebration of war crimes and war criminals that cause unimaginable suffering
26:04.040 - 26:06.760:  for the victims of genocide and survivors.
26:14.600 - 26:19.240:  Versions of history, the manipulation of history, of long-fueled conflict here.
26:20.020 - 26:23.400:  That is why truth matters so much now in Bosnia.
26:26.660 - 26:32.820:  That report by Fergal Keen. The beautiful Italian city of Venice is one of the most visited
26:32.820 - 26:36.640:  in the world and soon you'll have to pay a little bit more to enjoy it.
26:36.900 - 26:42.000:  The trial of a fee for daily visitors has been approved to try to control tourism.
26:42.680 - 26:48.620:  The charge of five euros, approximately five dollars, will apply to all daytrippers over the age of 14.
26:49.280 - 26:52.320:  They'll have to pay and book their entry to the city in advance.
26:53.200 - 26:58.020:  Beatrice Guzardi is a journalist in Venice. Does she think this is going to work?
26:59.240 - 27:06.120:  Absolutely not. I have to say unfortunately people have no welcome these five euros fee to enter
27:06.120 - 27:13.140:  very well. They feel this makes the city in a position that it looks like a theme park, which is not
27:13.140 - 27:17.480:  something people are very proud of because there are so many people and there's a community living
27:17.480 - 27:23.660:  here and they don't feel like this is going to work. Also five euros is the price of a meal deal
27:23.780 - 27:27.900:  and I don't think personally it's going to be a deterrent enough for people coming in.
27:28.060 - 27:32.900:  They're not going to just say, oh no, I'm not going to come into Venice because there's a five
27:32.900 - 27:38.480:  euros fee. But on the other side, the preventive booking system, this has, this is something that
27:38.480 - 27:46.560:  it's been proposed by citizens many years ago now in already in 2016 and 2017 and it was never
27:46.560 - 27:53.320:  taken into thoughts by the government and now they are thinking about it which is already something
27:53.320 - 27:58.620:  but obviously it needs to be put in place on a right way and needs to be regulated and controlled
27:58.620 - 28:04.460:  by the authorities as well. Journalist Beatrice Guzardi. The former tennis world number one,
28:04.460 - 28:10.120:  Simona Halib, has been banned for four years for breaching anti-doping rules. The two-time
28:10.120 - 28:15.980:  Grand Slam champion tested positive for a prohibited substance the US Open last year. Halib,
28:15.980 - 28:21.980:  who's 31, has said she will appeal. I asked our tennis correspondent Russell Fuller why such a
28:21.980 - 28:28.720:  severe penalty had been imposed. The independent panel, Jeanette, took into account two different
28:28.720 - 28:35.440:  findings and they found that Simona Halib had committed a doping irregularity one for testing
28:35.440 - 28:42.880:  positive for Roxadou stat which is sometimes used to treat anemia but has been on the anti-doping
28:42.880 - 28:49.380:  list for many many years when she returned a urine sample at the US Open 12 months ago and secondly
28:49.380 - 28:55.760:  that there were irregularities in her biological passport that's something that all athletes at the
28:55.760 - 29:01.200:  top levels of their sport have to sign up to and it allows the authorities to monitor their blood
29:01.200 - 29:06.340:  to give them an idea of when doping might be taking place. They decided that the irregularities
29:06.340 - 29:12.120:  in her biological passport were likely to suggest that doping had taken place at some point in 2022
29:12.900 - 29:17.400:  and as a result of having been found guilty effectively on those two counts she's received a
29:17.500 - 29:21.220:  four-year suspension and this could potentially spell the end of her career.
29:21.740 - 29:26.560:  Yes, if she's unable to play again for three more years it would be incredibly difficult for her
29:26.560 - 29:31.680:  at the age of just 35 to come back and try and compete at the highest level. Three more years
29:31.680 - 29:37.160:  because one year has already been served while she was waiting for this hearing to take place.
29:37.580 - 29:42.740:  The other factor is that she is planning to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport which is
29:43.840 - 29:48.640:  any tennis players who receive a verdict like this would need to appeal to if they want to
29:48.640 - 29:53.680:  take it any further and she says I refuse to accept this decision. She says she's shocked and
29:53.680 - 29:59.980:  disappointed. She does say that she adjusted her nutritional supplements ahead of the 2022
29:59.980 - 30:05.440:  hard court season which is where she returned this positive test and the tribunal did accept that
30:05.440 - 30:10.840:  she had taken a contaminated supplement but they decided that that would not have resulted
30:11.380 - 30:15.800:  in the concentration of Roxadoo's stat that was found in her urine sample.
30:16.800 - 30:22.480:  Russell Fuller, what comes first in the process of songwriting? The words or the music?
30:22.480 - 30:27.880:  Well, in the case of one of the world's most successful artists, Elton John, it's the words
30:28.600 - 30:33.320:  but they've always come from someone else, his longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin,
30:33.740 - 30:39.480:  a new autobiography from the man behind the lyrics in hits stretching back over 50 years reveals
30:39.480 - 30:44.360:  what inspired Bernie Taupin. He's been speaking to our reporter James Alexander.
30:45.100 - 30:51.640:  It's a pop partnership that started back in 1967. Elton John was a jogging pianist from the
30:51.640 - 30:57.400:  London suburbs. Bernie Taupin was an aspiring poet from the Lincolnshire countryside. Together,
30:57.940 - 31:00.740:  they've written some of the most famous songs of all time.
31:10.760 - 31:15.660:  Elton and Bernie met after both answering a record company adverts looking for new talent.
31:15.660 - 31:20.720:  Bernie says he was the start of a purely platonic 55 year bromance.
31:20.900 - 31:26.740:  We hit it off immediately, I mean, and became sort of surrogate brothers to each other.
31:26.740 - 31:30.340:  He was certainly like my big brother and I mean because he was more
31:31.060 - 31:37.780:  versed in the topography of London at the time and was playing in a semi-pro band and
31:38.180 - 31:44.940:  basically rescued me from a strange situation when I first met him in the studio because I was almost
31:44.940 - 31:50.880:  thrown out because they didn't think that I belonged there and I was just some sort of interloper
31:50.880 - 31:56.440:  but I'd been sent there to meet with him. So he sort of rescued me just in time, you know,
31:56.720 - 32:00.460:  came in and said, is there a Bernie Taupin here and I sort of rushed out and when
32:00.680 - 32:08.720:  it had to me, it's me. It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside.
32:09.800 - 32:14.020:  Anyone who's seen the Rocket Man movie will remember that great scene where
32:14.020 - 32:20.080:  you and Elton have met and moved in together and you're sharing a rickety bunk bed and
32:20.080 - 32:26.240:  writing all day and that's how you come up with your song. In the book, you suggest that's
32:26.540 - 32:32.000:  pretty much how it happened. Yeah, absolutely because you see us at the breakfast table,
32:32.800 - 32:39.500:  you see me writing, which is exactly how it happens. You know, I write the lyrics first and the
32:39.500 - 32:45.300:  melodies come later and when Elton picks it up, he said, I don't know if anybody caught this
32:45.300 - 32:50.160:  in the movie, he says, this has got egg on it and it actually did. It had like a coffee
32:50.160 - 32:56.980:  ring on it and a splash of egg yolk, you know, and then he just took it into the living room
32:57.320 - 33:02.500:  and started working on it. When your song came along, we went, yeah, this is different.
33:03.140 - 33:08.660:  This is really something special. I mean, we didn't really know how special it was at the time
33:09.320 - 33:17.720:  and how special it would become. One thing that really comes out of the book is your lifelong love
33:17.720 - 33:24.900:  of America, your fascination with American culture. You moved there in the 70s. You've lived there
33:25.300 - 33:32.060:  ever since. Right. Do you think having that space between you and Elton, who many lives in England,
33:32.260 - 33:38.360:  is partly why your partnership has lasted? We don't live in each other's pockets, but
33:39.360 - 33:47.000:  we're able to communicate and talk about our families and swap ideas and talk about music.
33:47.000 - 33:53.900:  There's an intense love between the two of us and I take great pride in our canon.
33:54.440 - 33:57.720:  I don't like questioning why it just works.
34:04.400 - 34:07.860:  And that was Elton John's lyricist, Bernie Tupin.
34:08.540 - 34:13.200:  A seven-year-old boy from the US is thought to have become the youngest person to successfully
34:13.200 - 34:18.460:  climb the old man of Hoy in Oakney, one of the UK's tallest sea stacks.
34:19.200 - 34:23.300:  Sea stacks in Keshe were wondering are columns of rocks that rise out of the sea.
34:23.560 - 34:30.440:  Judy Fankle reports. Cody Weissar scales the 137 meter sandstone column with his father and
34:30.440 - 34:36.220:  three friends last month. His family, originally from Missouri, are currently living in Esha
34:36.220 - 34:41.280:  and have been exploring climbing routes around Scotland. This was the moment they reached the top,
34:41.740 - 34:44.900:  surrounded on all sides by a sheer drop to the water below.
34:53.480 - 34:58.480:  Cody's dad, Bill, said he was beside his young son on a separate rope, giving him a device,
34:59.020 - 35:00.900:  but that he did it all by himself.
35:01.560 - 35:07.680:  When we got to pitch two, it was definitely difficult and I told him,
35:07.680 - 35:11.980:  I'm not going to help you. If you want to break this so-called record,
35:11.980 - 35:16.880:  you need to climb this on your own. I'm not going to push you up. I'm not going to give you
35:16.880 - 35:22.980:  any more than advice on how to climb it. He cleared the move and the rest was easy sailing.
35:23.280 - 35:27.000:  The dizzying heights weren't the only thing Cody braved during the perilous climb.
35:27.020 - 35:31.380:  He was also attacked by a nesting seabird known to vomit in self-defense.
35:31.380 - 35:35.220:  I didn't get spat on at the start, but then when we were pulling,
35:35.220 - 35:41.000:  I went down to a rope pole and it's like this bird has a really good aim in it,
35:41.120 - 35:45.220:  spat on my first ride in the cheek, but at least he didn't poop on me.
35:45.420 - 35:50.100:  Cody, who started climbing at the age of two, has now set himself a fresh target
35:50.560 - 35:54.640:  of climbing some of the other 10 tallest sea stacks around the coastline of Scotland.
35:55.380 - 35:58.700:  So lots more to come, it seems that report was by Judy Franco.
36:01.700 - 36:06.060:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
36:06.240 - 36:09.800:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email.

36:19.800 - 36:23.540:  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll, the producer of Liam McSheffrey.
36:23.580 - 36:27.920:  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Jean-Ancheleel. Until next time, goodbye.
36:37.120 - 36:40.720:  From hedge funds to angel investors to bull markets.
36:41.660 - 36:45.100:  In the world of finance, names can sometimes be a bit misleading.
36:45.620 - 36:46.740:  Take ours, for instance.
36:47.480 - 36:52.980:  LSEC, aka London Stock Exchange Group. We're in London, and we have a stock exchange,
36:52.980 - 36:56.520:  but that's just part of what we do. Today, we connect the news,
36:56.520 - 37:00.000:  information, insights, and systems that make the markets work.
37:00.600 - 37:05.720:  You see, others do some of what we do, but not everything we do. LSEC.
