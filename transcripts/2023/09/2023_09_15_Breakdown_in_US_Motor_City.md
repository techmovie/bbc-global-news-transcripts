*01:07.940- 01:15.280* :  Service. I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 15th of September, these are our
*01:15.280- 01:21.440* :  main stories. Workers at three of America's largest car makers have gone on strike. Iran has
*01:21.440- 01:26.800* :  massively increased security in the hometown of Masa Amini, a year on from her death at the hands
*01:26.800- 01:32.040* :  of the morality police. The former head of Spain's Football Federation has appeared in court for a
*01:32.040- 01:40.280* :  hearing to decide if he should face trial for alleged sexual assault. Also in this podcast, why did
*01:40.280- 01:46.540* :  two dams in the eastern Libyan city of Dernart fail so catastrophically with flooding killing at
*01:46.540- 01:53.640* :  least 11,000 people? We get the assessment of a specialist engineer and the end of a culinary
*01:53.640- 01:59.340* :  era. This was open at a time when there was very very little for Indian community, so it's something
*01:59.340- 02:05.300* :  quite important. To me it's a part of my father that is going forever, which is pretty hard.
*02:05.880- 02:11.960* :  Sadness as a 70 year old London institution prepares to serve up its final curry.
*02:14.960- 02:19.780* :  We begin in the United States where one of the largest labor unions has begun strike action
*02:19.780- 02:25.980* :  against Detroit's big three automakers, Ford, General Motors and the Chrysler owners Stellantis.
*02:26.240- 02:31.980* :  It's the first time they've downed tools all at the same time. The unions want to 40% wage
*02:31.980- 02:36.540* :  increase over the next four years, but car makers have responded with pay offers ranging from
*02:36.540- 02:44.120* :  17 and a half to 20%. There are warnings the strikes by the United auto workers or UAW could have
*02:44.120- 02:49.480* :  a major effect on the U.S. economy with costs running into billions of dollars. The union is
*02:49.480- 02:54.540* :  targeting just three plants to start with, but its president has warned many more union members
*02:54.540- 03:01.180* :  could walk out. Michelle Flurry joined the striking workers in Detroit. UAW president Sean van
*03:01.180- 03:08.940* :  arriving here at the picket line outside Ford's park to a rock stars welcome as workers greeted his
*03:08.940- 03:17.360* :  car with charts and charts and honking horns. We've had very constructive conversations. We made
*03:17.360- 03:22.180* :  countered offers again tonight. It's their fault. It's a shame that they waited to the last week to
*03:22.180- 03:26.440* :  start meeting with us. From day one we've told these companies you know we don't expect them to
*03:26.440- 03:30.260* :  delay and drag things out and that's what they chose to do. We didn't want to be here.
*03:30.300- 03:35.460* :  We want a fair agreement. We want fair economic and social justice for our members. That's what
*03:35.460- 03:40.760* :  this is all about and it's a shame. They drugged out. They waited to the last week. So here we are.
*03:40.900- 03:46.800* :  We got to do what we got to do. We're going to be out here until we get our share of economic justice
*03:47.040- 03:52.280* :  and it doesn't matter how long it takes. That's up to the companies. Here on the picket line spirit
*03:52.280- 03:59.100* :  are high. For the three car makers it has been a tough period of negotiation. They say in the
*03:59.100- 04:03.380* :  last few days they had increased their offer and that it was the union that was unwilling
*04:03.380- 04:09.100* :  to budge. Whilst the recriminations go on one thing is clear this strike even though it is
*04:09.100- 04:15.300* :  limited in nature will have a profound impact on the auto industry who knows where it will end.
*04:16.000- 04:21.100* :  So a huge impact on the US auto industry but what about elsewhere? Here's our business
*04:21.680- 04:26.280* :  correspondent Katie Silver. I guess the major global ramifications need to be contextualised in
*04:26.280- 04:30.760* :  the fact that the US economy being the world's largest then has an impact on other economies
*04:30.760- 04:35.260* :  around the world. So the question is how much is this going to impact the US economy to have
*04:35.260- 04:40.060* :  those flow and effects? There's a few areas in which we might see it impact the US economy first
*04:40.060- 04:44.960* :  and foremost of course is the car industry. So of course there has been shortages particularly
*04:44.960- 04:49.420* :  of parts after the pandemic. We talked a lot about semiconductor chips and that's meant that the
*04:49.420- 04:54.540* :  car supply generally has been lower. So they're going into this strike with a smaller supply
*04:54.540- 05:00.000* :  than usual. The initial plans to target just a number of factories of these companies means that
*05:00.000- 05:04.580* :  it wouldn't be a complete standstill. The question really is how it progresses and if things
*05:04.580- 05:11.160* :  ratchet up over time the economic impact will of course be greater. So the initial economic impact
*05:11.160- 05:16.880* :  fairly limited, about $500 million a day that's been estimated by the Anderson Economic Group.
*05:17.420- 05:24.080* :  That overall across 10 days amounts to about 0.02% of the annual output of the American economy
*05:24.080- 05:28.960* :  but as I say obviously if this goes on for longer and more plants are targeted then that's going
*05:28.960- 05:34.640* :  to see a bigger fallout. Katie Silver. With every day that passes the scale of the tragedy in Libya
*05:34.640- 05:40.300* :  grows 11,000 people are now known to have died but the mayor of Derna parts of which were simply
*05:40.300- 05:46.880* :  washed away by the flood waters says the true figure may be 20,000 and the horror compounded by
*05:46.880- 05:52.680* :  the fact that the bodies of many of those have yet to be recovered. Five days on more stories are
*05:52.680- 05:58.780* :  emerging of how some people survived. Mariam Aghivi is from Derna. She told her how she and her
*05:58.780- 06:04.760* :  four brothers and sisters managed to stay alive. The men of our building, our neighbors they were
*06:04.860- 06:10.480* :  screaming and nailing. They told us we have to get on the roof because the water started getting
*06:10.480- 06:15.720* :  higher and higher but as we were on the roof we were able to see other people on other buildings
*06:15.720- 06:21.060* :  roofs and they were waving with their phones and flash-ons and then suddenly the building collapsed.
*06:21.760- 06:27.060* :  At that moment we realized that actually we might die. It's so hard to lose everything like in a
*06:27.100- 06:32.780* :  second or loved ones losing the place you grew up in trying to figure out a way to accept that
*06:32.780- 06:38.660* :  all of this just happened and that it wasn't just a dream. Zango too about why the authorities in Libya
*06:38.660- 06:44.460* :  divided between east and west failed to carry out vital maintenance checks on the dams
*06:44.800- 06:50.540* :  which caused the floods. Andrew Hors is a British geotechnical engineer who's been studying
*06:50.540- 06:55.160* :  these specific dams on Google Earth and Claremock Donald asked him what he learned.
*06:55.720- 07:01.720* :  It looks as though the problem started about 15 miles to the south of Derna in the mountains there
*07:02.000- 07:08.580* :  and that's behind the first dam, the southern dam which is much the larger dam. It's situated in a
*07:08.580- 07:16.620* :  steep valley surrounded by impermeable rock mountains. Now if there was a extreme rainfall event which
*07:16.620- 07:22.460* :  the clearly was on that catchment the catchment is the area on which the rain falls and goes down
*07:22.460- 07:28.840* :  to the dam four inches of rain a hundred millimeters of rain could have generated a hundred million
*07:28.840- 07:37.060* :  tons of water behind that first dam. Now these dams are not built to store water they're not built
*07:37.100- 07:44.200* :  to generate electricity. The irony is they are built to attenuate flood flows to allow development
*07:44.200- 07:50.260* :  downstream and that's all they were they weren't big structures the southern structure was 25
*07:50.260- 07:56.780* :  meters high three hundred meters across well that's pretty big and then the small one at Derna
*07:57.040- 08:04.900* :  was only a hundred meters across but that dam by Derna had no chance of surviving once the main
*08:04.900- 08:10.620* :  dam broke and this is called a cascade failure. It's a hideous irony as you just pointed out that
*08:10.620- 08:16.760* :  these dams were built so building work could go on further down the valley and yet here we have
*08:16.760- 08:23.980* :  25% of this city flushed into the sea. What would have been the safety features that failed on
*08:23.980- 08:30.960* :  those dams? The dams didn't have safety features as far as I can tell they were rock pitched dams
*08:30.960- 08:36.640* :  which is basically lumps of rocks are mended together to form an impermeable barrier and give the
*08:36.640- 08:43.900* :  structure strength and behind these dams there were very similar structures like giant funnels
*08:44.420- 08:50.500* :  and these are the overflows so when the flood waters come down they rise behind the dam and then
*08:50.500- 08:57.480* :  slowly overflow into these funnel structures which takes the flood water at a controlled rate so
*08:57.480- 09:04.080* :  we're attenuating the flood and that funnel that pipe takes the flood water under the dam and down
*09:04.080- 09:10.840* :  into the riverbed where it flows at a more normal rate in other words it's not a torrent now
*09:11.500- 09:17.700* :  what would have happened in a catastrophic event potentially made worse by floating debris because
*09:17.700- 09:24.120* :  there is only one overflow structure so sprees would soon block it but I suspect it was simply
*09:24.120- 09:29.740* :  inundated these structures are over 40 years old and one hopes they were designed to some form
*09:29.740- 09:37.240* :  as standard but maybe not and so probably the first dam overtopped and once it overtopped there
*09:37.240- 09:43.560* :  would have been no chance of it surviving but it's not designed like a spillway a spillway is to take
*09:43.560- 09:51.300* :  the water that the normal overflow cannot cope with if you like an emergency overflow and some dams
*09:51.560- 09:57.500* :  may have two emergency overflows to take ever increasing flood waters but there was nothing like
*09:57.520- 10:05.420* :  this here just one overflow structure on each dam clearly serious questions being raised about
*10:05.420- 10:10.500* :  why the money wasn't forthcoming after Colonel Gaddafi was overthrown over 10 years ago now when
*10:10.500- 10:16.840* :  they needed repair funds both of these dams given the fact we have to factor in global warming now
*10:17.000- 10:21.740* :  do we need to look worldwide at how certain dams have been constructed why they've been
*10:21.780- 10:26.560* :  constructed in the way that they have so we do not see a repeat of this utter tragedy people have
*10:26.560- 10:31.800* :  been making political points in Libya on this I suspect nothing would have been done these are
*10:31.800- 10:38.020* :  small structures for all we know they may have been in perfect repair but they were simply
*10:38.020- 10:45.540* :  inundated by an event way greater than they were designed for and in answer to your second question
*10:45.540- 10:51.540* :  do we need to look at dams worldwide we are the whole time after every event flood studies are
*10:51.540- 10:58.920* :  rewritten and dams spillways are improved to take much larger events and they're always theoretical
*10:58.920- 11:06.460* :  events but we had one recently in the UK at Toddbrook and within 12 months the flood studies had
*11:06.460- 11:14.780* :  been redesigned and spillways across Europe were being made to have a greater capacity engineer and
*11:14.780- 11:20.340* :  through haurs tens of millions of people around the world suffer from Alzheimer's the most common
*11:20.340- 11:25.360* :  form of dementia so research that adds to our knowledge of the causes and possible treatment
*11:25.360- 11:31.080* :  is always welcome like scientists in Britain and Belgium say they may have discovered the mechanism
*11:31.080- 11:37.580* :  by which brain cells die in people suffering from Alzheimer's a health correspondent James Gannon has
*11:37.580- 11:42.160* :  been looking at their findings if you look at brain scans of people you see huge numbers of brain
*11:42.160- 11:47.000* :  cells dying inside people with the condition that's why it leads to things like memory loss
*11:47.580- 11:52.100* :  however as was described to me last night by one leading scientist one of the fundamental gaps we
*11:52.100- 11:57.440* :  have in our knowledge of the disease and we do know a lot is why do those brain cells actually die
*11:57.440- 12:04.240* :  what is the process of those brain cells dying and that's what this study is tackling so by teasing
*12:04.240- 12:09.980* :  it apart they've identified this process called necroptosis and that's a form of cellular suicide
*12:09.980- 12:15.540* :  it's a natural part of the human body it's how the body balances out the growth of new cells with
*12:15.540- 12:20.100* :  purging the ones that no longer needs but what they've teased apart in this study is showing
*12:20.180- 12:24.240* :  some of the proteins that we see building up in the brains of Alzheimer's disease triggering
*12:24.240- 12:29.820* :  that process in the brain and in some of those experiments they were able to block that process
*12:29.820- 12:34.480* :  from happening so even in the circumstances in laboratory experiments where you'd expect brain cells
*12:34.480- 12:39.860* :  to die they could keep them alive so we have got some of the first drugs for treating Alzheimer's
*12:39.860- 12:45.800* :  disease that actually start to change the course of the disease and they target the buildup of the
*12:45.800- 12:50.380* :  abnormal proteins in the brain and kind of like flush the matter that's how they work and that's
*12:50.380- 12:55.280* :  how they are slowing the course of the disease this is looking a little bit further down the line going
*12:55.280- 13:00.380* :  well actually how is it that that leads to brain cells dying and there's opened up this new avenue
*13:00.380- 13:05.700* :  well now we've identified this process is it possible that we can kind of get in there and actually
*13:05.700- 13:10.840* :  do something to stop those brain cells dying there's a whole load of research before you would
*13:10.840- 13:15.520* :  actually get to that point of knowing can you do that would that be a successful therapy but
*13:16.060- 13:20.920* :  I've spoken to scientists the words I'm getting back are this is cool this is fascinating this is
*13:20.920- 13:27.620* :  an important discovery but it's still a long way off a medicine. James Gallagher the vomahead of
*13:27.620- 13:33.060* :  Spain's national football federation Louis Rabiales has been in court for a hearing to decide whether
*13:33.060- 13:38.160* :  he should face trial for sexual assault during celebrations after Spain won the women's world
*13:38.160- 13:43.760* :  cut last month he was seen grabbing the striker Jenny Homozo and kissing her on the lips he claims
*13:43.760- 13:50.340* :  it was consensual a correspondent guy Hedgeco was at the court in Madrid Mr. Rabiales spent about an
*13:50.340- 13:55.400* :  hour in the courtroom he didn't speak at all to the press either on his arrival or after leaving
*13:55.400- 14:01.620* :  but we have heard some reports of what went on for example Jenny Edmossos lawyer has spoken to
*14:01.620- 14:06.260* :  the press and said that she had reiterated the position of her client which was that the kiss
*14:06.260- 14:12.920* :  was not consensual we've also heard the position of mr. Rabiales during the hearing which was
*14:13.240- 14:18.640* :  that he had again repeated his line that it was a consensual kiss that he'd done nothing wrong
*14:18.640- 14:24.700* :  that he was completely innocent of any wrongdoing and also he apparently denied that there had been
*14:24.700- 14:30.700* :  any coercion by him or his team there are also accusations against him of coercion in that
*14:31.000- 14:36.480* :  there are claims that he and his team had pressured Jenny Edmossos to go public and play down
*14:36.480- 14:41.880* :  the importance of the kiss after it took place and after the whole controversy surrounding it
*14:42.060- 14:47.720* :  had started and we also understand that the prosecutor in court asked for a restraining order
*14:48.020- 14:52.640* :  is that correct yes that is something that the prosecutor has requested a restraining order
*14:52.640- 14:59.180* :  for mr. Rabiales to keep him away from Jenny Edmossos by distance of at least 500 meters at all times
*14:59.740- 15:04.560* :  and also the other request by the prosecutor was that mr. Rabiales should appear in this court
*15:04.560- 15:10.800* :  every two weeks we don't know if the magistrate will accept those requests and implement them
*15:10.800- 15:15.020* :  we're waiting for that now but we should hear that news relatively soon
*15:15.360- 15:23.960* :  Guy Hedgeko in Spain he's still to come it's a great pleasure to have this prize for such a fundamental
*15:23.960- 15:30.040* :  thing in George and chemistry as looking rocks this year's winners for the ignoble awards that
*15:30.040- 15:36.400* :  make people laugh then think and before we move on here's Andrew Peach with news of this week's
*15:36.620- 15:42.320* :  happy pod yes this week the story of Moose the dog who saved Sheila and Chris from a fire on their
*15:42.320- 15:47.880* :  houseboat they join me from Texas to tell the story which they've also set to music if you heard
*15:47.880- 15:53.300* :  about the American cave who fell ill thousands of meters below ground in Turkey cave rescuers
*15:53.300- 15:58.860* :  the whole world join forces to work out how to get him out safely i'll talk to the Croatian man
*15:58.860- 16:04.000* :  who led the rescue effort and if you're swimming 50 kilometers in the sea how the biggest
*16:04.000- 16:10.300* :  challenge comes from the jellyfish i'll talk to John T who took them on a few days ago he's an amputee
*16:10.300- 16:15.800* :  by the way those stories and more in the happy pod available to download in this feed every Saturday

*16:59.920- 17:05.400* :  died in state custody after she'd been arrested by the country's morality police for allegedly
*17:05.400- 17:11.820* :  not wearing her veil properly it sparked an uprising led by women and girls demanding not just
*17:11.820- 17:18.300* :  an end to the compulsory dress code but much wider freedoms after several months the regime succeeded
*17:18.300- 17:24.640* :  in crushing the protests but not the widespread desire for change to mark the anniversary the
*17:24.640- 17:31.060* :  BBC has been hearing from Iranian women maughan ilanlu is a filmmaker living in Tehran and has
*17:31.060- 17:36.700* :  been arrested numerous times by the morality police she says she takes inspiration from
*17:36.700- 17:43.980* :  African-American civil rights activist Rosa Parks who back in 1955 refused to give up her seat
*17:43.980- 17:53.000* :  on a racially segregated bus in Alabama what has changed after master's death is men's public
*17:53.000- 17:59.540* :  opinion of women in the streets in the metro in basades men constantly admire women they

*20:13.720- 20:19.380* :  per placing an emphasis on good manners the world values study looked at data across a number of
*20:19.380- 20:25.280* :  categories a Stephanie Prentice report the annual study found wealthier nations shifting away
*20:25.280- 20:31.220* :  from traditional values like hard work and obedience to ones like self expression and developing
*20:31.220- 20:37.180* :  nations focusing more on good manners and religious faith the old saying in the UK that children
*20:37.180- 20:44.220* :  should be seen and not heard is seemingly a thing of the past only 12% of parents there reported
*20:44.220- 20:51.060* :  caring about obedience compared to almost 40% caring about imagination and China Sweden and
*20:51.060- 20:55.780* :  South Korea joined the UK at the bottom of the rankings when it came to requiring children to
*20:55.780- 21:02.160* :  behave themselves the study also looked at generational differences and found that Gen Z parents
*21:02.160- 21:09.300* :  born after 1996 valued obedience significantly less than the generations before them when it came

*23:01.160- 23:06.800* :  place it has served Indian curry which we saw desperately needed for all those years well before
*23:06.800- 23:12.420* :  any other place opened so we've come to pay homage to it before it shuts this was open at time
*23:12.420- 23:17.260* :  when there was very very little for Indian community so it's something quite important it's

*23:37.740- 23:43.640* :  I'm sitting down here now in this pack room with people crammed in on sofas waiting for tables with
*23:43.640- 23:47.800* :  somebody who has a very close personal relationship with his club would you mind introducing yourself

*25:01.560- 25:07.100* :  something goes even marginally wrong they keep saying sorry that has not changed at all

*27:14.920- 27:20.980* :  geologists do all the time in the field because something that's not very clear then becomes
*27:20.980- 27:26.380* :  much clearer when you look at it with the wet surface perhaps more appetizing the rocks is the
