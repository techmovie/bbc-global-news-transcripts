*01:31.720- 01:33.320* :  the 23rd of September,
*01:33.840- 01:37.760* :  people from the outside might just think that we're here just waking up and
*01:38.180- 01:41.360* :  and going to the gym and then going to the field and kicking a ball around,
*01:41.700- 01:43.520* :  but it's so much more than that.
*01:44.440- 01:47.740* :  The rapid rise of women's football in Saudi Arabia,
*01:48.260- 01:52.800* :  an ambitious plan to release 2000 Southern white rhino into the world in Africa.
*01:52.800- 01:55.800* :  Something at this scale has never been attempted before.
*01:55.800- 01:58.100* :  We're going to need all the help that we can get.
*01:58.100- 02:00.120* :  It's going to give us a lot of sleep this night,
*02:00.220- 02:03.320* :  but we are extremely excited about the possibility.
*02:04.480- 02:07.600* :  Also in this podcast, what it takes to win the award for
*02:07.600- 02:09.580* :  young astronomy photographer of the year.
*02:10.020- 02:11.400* :  The picture is really amazing.
*02:11.620- 02:13.440* :  It is incredibly colorful,
*02:13.900- 02:15.260* :  but it's really nicely balanced.
*02:15.800- 02:20.360* :  We were just really blown away by how well every aspect of it was done.
*02:21.540- 02:24.700* :  And the people offering respite care for pets in the US.
*02:25.360- 02:30.200* :  That was a blessing to me to know that I could go through what I was going through
*02:30.560- 02:35.300* :  and still know that my dogs were well taken care of and that they come back home to me.
*02:40.880- 02:45.240* :  Women in Saudi Arabia were only permitted to drive in 2018.
*02:45.340- 02:49.940* :  And it was a year later that the women's football department of Saudi Arabian
*02:49.940- 02:51.160* :  football was established.
*02:51.760- 02:55.540* :  Now they are ranked in FIFA with a world-class Premier League team
*02:55.540- 02:58.920* :  and there are 4,000 female football trainees.
*02:59.940- 03:03.660* :  There's been a new documentary on the rise of the women's national team called
*03:04.100- 03:05.020* :  Destined to Play.
*03:06.020- 03:10.220* :  Little kids are looking at you and they're watching you play and they're getting inspired
*03:10.220- 03:14.360* :  and you realise that you're doing more than just playing the game.
*03:14.540- 03:17.120* :  What has never done that to you?
*03:20.220- 03:25.320* :  It includes women's national team midfielder Leigh Ann Juhari and women's football
*03:25.320- 03:28.180* :  technical director at the Saudi Arabian Football Federation
*03:28.220- 03:31.800* :  former head coach of the national team Monika Stab.
*03:31.820- 03:35.240* :  They told us about the development of Saudi women's football.
*03:35.640- 03:40.780* :  I've always loved football and my whole family tree and my country just were huge football
*03:40.780- 03:41.920* :  fans, it's in our blood.
*03:41.920- 03:47.660* :  So I was always inspired to play and finally when I came back to Rijiddo in 2017,
*03:47.720- 03:51.820* :  I joined my first proper team and I was really surprised to find a team here
*03:52.040- 03:55.340* :  because at that time there wasn't a lot of support and there wasn't really a platform.
*03:55.340- 04:00.320* :  So when I found the team and I joined it was like a dream come true and bit by bit
*04:00.320- 04:02.140* :  the development was out of this world.
*04:02.560- 04:07.200* :  But tell us a little bit about when you were growing up because football was always there
*04:07.200- 04:15.260* :  in the background but perhaps women's football girls sport hasn't always been encouraged
*04:15.260- 04:16.800* :  in Saudi Arabia.
*04:17.080- 04:21.760* :  Well there was always women playing in their neighborhoods and they were renting out fields
*04:21.760- 04:28.000* :  and playing but just it was never official, it was never something that was in social media
*04:28.000- 04:30.240* :  or something that people can go and watch the games.
*04:30.700- 04:32.500* :  Monika you've worked all over the world.
*04:33.060- 04:40.180* :  What are the specific challenges for you of finding and nurturing women players in Saudi?
*04:40.580- 04:46.040* :  It was a big challenge to change of course their mindset now they're going to be a national player
*04:46.040- 04:50.780* :  because before they played with their brothers with their cousins with their uncles
*04:50.780- 04:56.100* :  on the street you know on somewhere on somewhere on the ground and I thought okay you give
*04:56.100- 04:59.960* :  your best and then they won the first game and I was just thinking wow.
*05:00.540- 05:06.680* :  Do you remember how you felt the first time you ran on to a pitch for an international
*05:07.480- 05:08.280* :  representing your country?
*05:08.500- 05:14.400* :  Oh yeah that was quite a moment it felt like the whole that whole camp felt like a dream
*05:14.680- 05:18.700* :  because we never ever played a game together and a lot of us it was the first time we even
*05:18.700- 05:24.060* :  meet each other we just held each other's hands and really put all our trust in each other
*05:24.060- 05:28.380* :  we had no idea what's going to happen we had no expectations and that's how we went in
*05:28.380- 05:34.820* :  we went in with our own expectations of ourselves and our own spirit and we really poured our
*05:34.820- 05:41.880* :  hearts out and I remember it just felt like there's nothing left to do but give everything you know
*05:41.880- 05:48.140* :  because I know everyone back home is watching and so it was there's definitely so so so exciting
*05:48.140- 05:52.380* :  it's a moment it's like a once in a lifetime moment to be honest but I have a dream
*05:52.380- 05:57.480* :  they want to go to the World Cup Saudi is a crazy football nation I didn't know that I just
*05:57.480- 06:03.740* :  been coming on a plane from Rhea to Damam I was sitting there as I cannot take a picture coach
*06:03.740- 06:09.080* :  I said do you know me yeah yeah of course I know you I said huh you know I felt in the beginning
*06:09.080- 06:14.140* :  when I was still the coach in the first year I was like a pop star everyone who I was recognized
*06:14.140- 06:20.200* :  in the Supermarkt this doesn't happen in my country Germany for sure and one of my uncles I remember
*06:21.120- 06:27.400* :  for for a second ever official it had much we lost my uncle has never texted me okay and what's up
*06:27.680- 06:34.240* :  he texted me with an angry emoji why did you guys lose yeah and I was like I was loving I was like
*06:34.240- 06:40.140* :  oh my god it was so beautiful to see that he really cared about it to him because I'm playing for
*06:40.140- 06:46.480* :  obviously the team that we all support as well do you still encounter any social or family
*06:46.540- 06:54.980* :  opposition to girls and women being out on a field and playing football well to tell you the
*06:54.980- 07:00.760* :  truth I've been around in many countries and of course in Muslim country it's not easy I'm not
*07:00.760- 07:06.340* :  saying that every parents are happy my daughter is going to play of course not we had prejudice in
*07:06.340- 07:12.340* :  our country in Germany it was banned from our FA in Germany and I know I've been going through
*07:12.340- 07:19.280* :  now 53 years of fighting women football I've been around the world trying to convince every man
*07:19.280- 07:25.020* :  mainly man also women of course but the girls want to play the game they're just happy to play
*07:25.020- 07:31.200* :  the game they won't be part of the game and and it's such a enjoyable game I mean like everything in
*07:31.200- 07:36.220* :  the world there's always going to be a different side there's always criticism but the enthusiasm
*07:36.220- 07:43.080* :  we've seen and the support we've seen definitely over a shadow is it what does being part of a sports
*07:43.080- 07:51.200* :  team a team of women what does it mean to you what it means to be in a woman's team is it's so much
*07:51.200- 07:57.140* :  respect and support we like to sing we always have it's called a rap though which is like a group of
*07:57.660- 08:02.380* :  of people that have the drums and the microphone and everything probably what my favorite one is
*08:02.380- 08:08.800* :  well for us with none love with none Lailina which means the victory hopefully will be for us
*08:09.240- 08:15.620* :  midfielder Leandro Harry and we also heard from Monika Stab now last week we heard about the
*08:15.620- 08:21.000* :  international efforts to rescue American Cava Mark Dickie who suffered a medical emergency
*08:21.000- 08:26.880* :  deep in the Turkish-Morjah cave system we spoke to the head of the European Association of Cave
*08:26.880- 08:34.280* :  rescuers because Mark himself was in hospital well now he's out so Mark how are you I am doing very
*08:34.280- 08:40.700* :  well I've received excellent care from the moment the mini ICU arrived in the cave so from that
*08:40.700- 08:45.480* :  moment the recovery started and has been continuing since so at this point I've been discharged from
*08:45.480- 08:52.420* :  the hospital if I'm up and about still weak on a day-to-day basis but I'm happy and I'm out there
*08:52.420- 08:58.040* :  doing stuff we heard that message that you sent up when you were still awaiting rescue and you
*08:58.040- 09:03.060* :  sounded confident and calm but I did read that there was a point when you thought you wouldn't
*09:03.060- 09:09.920* :  actually get out I am exceptionally proud of the cave in community and I am happy to give them
*09:09.920- 09:17.300* :  this this pure from the heart truly meant words like I had no doubt whatsoever that I was going
*09:17.300- 09:22.500* :  to reach the surface once I crossed that point of survival this is representative of the
*09:22.500- 09:28.120* :  caving community the international caving community and it's an amazing thing we are a tight-knit
*09:28.120- 09:33.160* :  bunch no matter where you come from we knew their capabilities and we knew their friendship we knew
*09:33.160- 09:38.980* :  that they would do whatever they could to get there for people who who can't see the appeal
*09:40.100- 09:46.820* :  what is the appeal of exploring caves honestly adventure exploration there is science behind
*09:46.820- 09:53.160* :  it as well and I am not a scientist but I like the the discovery I like the pushing the limits of
*09:53.160- 09:58.740* :  human exploration going places that no humans have ever been before seeing things that have never
*09:58.740- 10:05.620* :  been seen and sometimes these cascades are just stunning and I gather that although you are currently
*10:05.620- 10:11.240* :  in Turkey you are planning to meet up with some of the people involved in your rescue oh absolutely
*10:11.240- 10:17.800* :  once I am free to travel I will be immediately heading over to Hungary and I'll be honest
*10:17.800- 10:22.180* :  while I probably won't participate too strongly I have a feeling there's going to be a party
*10:22.460- 10:29.200* :  I have a feeling is right that was Mark Dickie now to a hugely ambitious plan to rewild 2000
*10:29.200- 10:35.220* :  white southern rhinos from a captive breeding program across Africa over the next 10 years
*10:35.720- 10:41.120* :  the animals were taken on by the conservation group african parks after an auction fails to attract
*10:41.120- 10:47.580* :  any beds they hope to relocate them in protected areas across the continent to help secure the species
*10:47.580- 10:54.400* :  future Peter Fernhead is the chief executive officer and co-founder of african parks rhino are going
*10:54.400- 11:00.820* :  through a very very tough time the poaching pressure on these animals is just incredible and more
*11:00.820- 11:06.560* :  than 50% of the rhinos in South Africa have been poached in the last 10 years so we're talking about
*11:06.560- 11:13.600* :  a species that is under tremendous pressure now african parks is talking about rewilding over 2000
*11:13.780- 11:20.300* :  southern white rhino tell us about the origins of these animals and how they came to be with you
*11:21.040- 11:27.900* :  in South Africa there is a very active sector where people are able to buy and sell wildlife
*11:27.900- 11:34.180* :  and a particular individual who had a particular passion for rhinos through very successful breeding
*11:34.180- 11:40.700* :  he built that population up to these 2000 animals but the farm has been facing financial ruin
*11:41.120- 11:46.280* :  and then he put the whole farm and all the animals on auction at the end of April but he did not have
*11:46.280- 11:51.700* :  a single bid that was received and as a result of that we were facing something of a conservation
*11:51.740- 11:59.300* :  crisis where the largest single population and probably with the best diversity of all white rhino
*11:59.300- 12:05.980* :  on the continent of Africa was now at an incredible risk so african parks was approached by quite a
*12:05.980- 12:12.880* :  few conservationists and that's why now today we're now also responsible for a rhino farm with these
*12:12.880- 12:21.960* :  2000 animals so we want to make sure that these rhino in approximately 7 to 20 conservation areas
*12:21.960- 12:29.700* :  across the continent are completely successfully rewilded and in doing so those areas are safe secure
*12:29.700- 12:38.120* :  conservation areas for all species and for mankind and society that depends on them and that for us
*12:38.180- 12:44.420* :  I think would be the absolute pinnacle of success to be able to achieve that on the back of these
*12:44.420- 12:50.900* :  rhino now obviously 2000 rhinos is no small proposition how are you going to do that what exactly
*12:50.900- 12:55.400* :  you're going to do well I think the first thing is probably with a lot of sleepless nights because
*12:56.200- 13:00.960* :  this is an enormous undertaking I mean something at this scale has never been attempted before
*13:00.960- 13:07.060* :  so fortunately we we have access to the best people in the business the best veterinarians
*13:07.060- 13:13.300* :  the best logistics people the equipment so with a huge amount of difficulty we're going to need all
*13:13.300- 13:17.780* :  the help that we can get from people that want to be part of the solution we're going to need to
*13:17.780- 13:22.520* :  engage governments as potential recipients of some of these animals as I said it's going to give
*13:22.520- 13:28.340* :  us a lot of sleepless nights but we are extremely excited about the possibility and what sort of
*13:28.340- 13:35.740* :  protection will they have from predation by poachers and the like so when we engage with governments
*13:35.740- 13:41.740* :  and we engage with the conservation sector we will be looking at their ability to make sure
*13:41.820- 13:47.400* :  that the areas that they're going to are safe we want to make sure that this is a successful
*13:47.420- 13:53.500* :  strategy for the conservation of white rhino across the continent why did you get involved in
*13:53.500- 13:59.440* :  conservation why would you want to do anything else it's a it's a passion and it's something where
*14:00.000- 14:06.220* :  I think everyone that works for African parks has a passion for conservation for Africa for the
*14:06.220- 14:12.200* :  people of Africa and those are all completely intertwined I have that passion it wasn't stolen
*14:12.200- 14:17.620* :  me as a young boy and it's only ever grown since then Peter Furnhead of African Parks
*14:23.420- 14:30.300* :  still to come everyone says we are lazy if we say for example we are well organized to have time
*14:30.300- 14:36.960* :  to be lazy sometimes the contest to be crowned Montenegro's laziest citizen
*14:45.460- 14:50.480* :  I'm Dr. Laurie Santos host of the Happiness Lab podcast it's never too late or too early

*15:28.320- 15:34.260* :  thing they came to my brain was what if I do a drag show remarkable personal stories told by the
*15:34.260- 15:39.660* :  people that lived them I could easily have pulled that trigger but that was not my brief I was not

*16:43.020- 16:48.800* :  Chinese film nights hosted by Desiree Filet a German gallery owner who's built a collection of
*16:48.920- 16:55.780* :  ancient and modern East Asian art in a sprawling second-world war bunker just south of Potsdamer
*16:56.700- 17:04.360* :  I'm in love with Asia and focusing now on China I thought it's beautiful to show different
*17:05.340- 17:11.860* :  versions of filmmakers the young important generation who is really forming pictures
*17:12.220- 17:20.280* :  now in China and hopefully also outside of China. The films are a gateway to modern Chinese culture
*17:20.280- 17:26.300* :  but for members of the Asian diaspora in Berlin they're also an opportunity to reconnect with the
*17:26.300- 17:34.460* :  region it's really good to show East Asian culture as well I feel like willing it's really really
*17:34.460- 17:40.760* :  freedom the fairly collection is also showing the work of Japanese born artist Likou Ikimura
*17:40.940- 17:47.040* :  who's lived and worked in Berlin for more than three decades there are wistfully painted landscapes
*17:47.040- 17:53.100* :  and sculpted rabbit figures on black velvet cushions from the right angle the creatures look
*17:53.100- 18:00.460* :  like parts of the human anatomy Ikimura arrived in Berlin in 1991 to become a professor at the
*18:00.460- 18:07.380* :  Berlin University of the Arts she says Berlin has maintained the anything goes improvisational spirit
*18:07.380- 18:13.820* :  of those early years after the wall came down but she also says the art scene can still be a little
*18:13.820- 18:20.800* :  too domestic and inward looking for foreign artists it was not so easy for me to start my
*18:20.800- 18:29.340* :  artist career here it's kind of matching pot it's not only Asian as also Africa and in you know
*18:29.340- 18:35.880* :  America but I would say if you come here with London or Paris or New York Berlin need another
*18:35.900- 18:43.140* :  decade to be spreading more more more you know really augmented Ikimura says collections like
*18:43.140- 18:49.060* :  this one combining different cultures and time periods infuse some desperately needed uniqueness
*18:49.060- 18:57.100* :  into the arts world so tendency it's a party party art now it's a kind of similarity and it's
*18:57.240- 19:02.800* :  foreign you know I don't want to see in Hong Kong the same thing like in New York and there's the same
*19:02.800- 19:10.880* :  Missosa in Berlin and this is why I feel very honored to be in the core of the town we do
*19:10.880- 19:18.100* :  something different it's so beautiful and this is the most important tendency that we need
*19:18.100- 19:24.640* :  that report by Peter Goffin in Berlin now some of the other things to catch our attention this week
*19:24.640- 19:31.500* :  the rediscovery of an elusive bat in Brazil the Histiotus Alliensis which has big triangular
*19:31.500- 19:38.600* :  ears hadn't been seen since 1916 but it's been confirmed that the second ever specimen was discovered
*19:38.600- 19:45.180* :  in a survey in the Brazilian state of Paraná the environmental group WWF says the snow leopard
*19:45.180- 19:52.140* :  population in Bhutan is up nearly 40% in milestone achievement thanks to conservation efforts the
*19:52.140- 19:59.820* :  National Snow Leopard Survey of 2022 2023 found that there are now at least 132 snow leopards in the
*19:59.820- 20:06.660* :  country and some good news for a dog abandoned as a puppy in Thailand buttons was taken in by an
*20:06.660- 20:11.800* :  animal charity which was surprised to get an adoption application from the British rock star Liam
*20:11.800- 20:18.820* :  Gallagher he is said to be and I quote totally smitten and he describes buttons as biblical now time
*20:18.820- 20:25.420* :  for a bit of stargazing there were over 4000 entries from 64 countries and other winners have
*20:25.420- 20:30.720* :  been announced for the Royal Observatory Greenwich Astronomy Photographer of the Year and the
*20:30.720- 20:37.040* :  images aren't just beautiful they're scientifically important as well the winners were Marcel Drexler
*20:37.260- 20:44.740* :  Xavier Strottner and Jan Saunti Dr. Ed Blumma was one of the judges so what was so special about
*20:44.740- 20:49.900* :  their picture? It's an astonishing image because the picture quality itself is really really
*20:49.900- 20:54.860* :  had so fundamentally it's a great picture of the Andromeda Galaxy but it also has that really
*20:54.860- 21:01.120* :  I think that having showed us above other trends this year is that it was able to by looking at
*21:01.120- 21:06.740* :  double eye eyes oxygen reveal this and in the images so that the stranger kind of looks like a
*21:06.740- 21:13.200* :  smudge but this region of double eye eyes oxygen that has been there in any other picture you've
*21:13.200- 21:17.540* :  seen of that region of space but in the pictures themselves they haven't revealed it so it's
*21:17.540- 21:22.240* :  revealing something new and it's an astonishingly good picture. And looking at the young astronomy
*21:22.240- 21:29.460* :  photograph of the year that was two 14-year-old boys from China runway two and Binyu Wang
*21:29.460- 21:34.940* :  described their picture for us. So this is a picture of a maybe that's called a running chicken
*21:34.940- 21:39.520* :  maybe that does it actually look like a running chicken in any way? I was good I was good to see
*21:40.740- 21:46.780* :  one some sort of point of doubt you've been maybe see maybe the picture is really amazing it's got
*21:46.780- 21:52.920* :  lots of this lovely detailed structure to it it is incredibly colorful we were just really
*21:52.920- 21:59.660* :  born away by how well every aspect of it was done. You talked a little bit earlier about the sort
*21:59.660- 22:06.960* :  of kit that photographers in this particular competition will be making use of as well as
*22:06.960- 22:13.100* :  the technique. Talk us through the sort of process. Some people are using very large robotic
*22:13.100- 22:19.440* :  controls telescope but having said that we've had people that have taken snapshots on iPad so taking
*22:19.440- 22:25.420* :  snapshots definitely has a place in the competition. And why are competitions like this important?
*22:26.040- 22:29.520* :  Well I think there's a few things I mean one of them is just that we've produced these amazing
*22:29.520- 22:33.780* :  images that everybody can enjoy and recognising the hard work that people could enter it.
*22:33.780- 22:39.140* :  That was Dr. Ed Blumer I will share the winning photographs on social media using the hashtag
*22:39.140- 22:43.580* :  the happy pod on platforms that still do hashtags and you'll just have to look for me on the other
*22:43.580- 22:47.880* :  ones I'm sorry. Now we've talked before about the connections between humans and their animals
*22:47.880- 22:53.040* :  and what a difference they can make to health and well-being but what happens when we can't take
*22:53.040- 22:58.360* :  care of them for unforeseen and unavoidable reasons like homelessness or hospital treatment when
*22:58.360- 23:04.460* :  you just don't have anyone who can step in. We've been talking to Christina who co-founded Ruff Haven
*23:04.460- 23:10.280* :  in Utah in the US and to Petona Robin. There was nothing like this in Utah or even across the
*23:10.280- 23:17.240* :  country really of picking someone's pet when their person is just experiencing a very temporary
*23:17.240- 23:23.420* :  crisis in their life and didn't have that network of friends and family who could care for them
*23:23.560- 23:30.360* :  and their pet was their life so that's what we saw the need and we just kind of hit the ground
*23:30.620- 23:37.860* :  we keep in touch with the owner they get updates on their animals and then we happily reunite them
*23:37.860- 23:43.380* :  when the time comes so it's the best feeling to see these pets go back to the family who loves them.
*23:43.560- 23:49.940* :  So Robin I understand you actually made use of Ruff Haven. Would you mind explaining to us what
*23:49.940- 23:57.180* :  happened how you came to need them? I had a medical emergency that was pretty serious. I had no
*23:57.180- 24:03.480* :  one to take my dogs and to think that I'd have to give them up would have been devastating and a
*24:03.480- 24:11.260* :  friend of my son suggested that I contact Ruff Haven and they were just a godsend to know that
*24:11.260- 24:17.060* :  I could go through what I was going through and still know that my dogs were taking care of
*24:17.380- 24:23.860* :  and that they come back home to me. And now you actually are part of the fostering program aren't you?
*24:24.280- 24:30.480* :  I am. I tell them I have a revolving door when you pick up one, bring me another and just to know
*24:30.480- 24:35.840* :  that they can go home to their people like my dogs were able to come home to me. That means
*24:35.840- 24:43.160* :  everything to me. I just want to thank Christina. I'm grateful to have met them. They are just a group
*24:43.160- 24:49.860* :  of the most amazing people and there needs to be more opportunities out there for people who
*24:50.560- 24:55.760* :  come into bad times to be able to fall back and know that they can still have their pets which
*24:56.180- 25:01.440* :  to me and I'm sure a lot of other people means everything. That was Robin and we also heard from
*25:01.440- 25:06.880* :  Christina co-founder of Ruff Haven in Utah. Now one of the world's oddest annual competitions
*25:06.880- 25:13.220* :  is now into its second month. As we record this podcast four people remain in the running to
*25:13.220- 25:19.460* :  become Montenegro's laziest citizen and they don't have to do so much as lift a finger to prove it.
*25:19.880- 25:24.720* :  It all started 12 years ago as a response to the regional stereotype that Montenegro's were,
*25:24.720- 25:30.520* :  shall we say, not the hardest workers. And as our Balkans correspondent Gaita Lone reports,
*25:30.520- 25:33.760* :  they've decided they're going to take that lying down.
*25:37.060- 25:43.340* :  They are actually physically, mentally, really strong people. Boris Krunich is one of the organizers
*25:43.340- 25:49.420* :  of the competition at the Ethno Village Montenegro, a collection of log cabins and stone huts,
*25:49.640- 25:56.020* :  nestling under the nearby mountains. They usually have a small like funny joke of us
*25:56.520- 26:06.540* :  that Montenegro people are lazy people. So we came one idea to let's try on that joke to make
*26:06.540- 26:15.240* :  some competition that make love everyone and to show the people that actually maybe we are that.
*26:15.360- 26:21.300* :  I thought you were going to say the other way round that we'll have this competition that
*26:21.300- 26:26.260* :  shows people that people from Montenegro aren't lazy at all, but no, you're trying to confirm
*26:26.260- 26:33.640* :  the stereotype. Yeah, I mean, we don't actually confirm it, but we say, for example, that everyone
*26:33.640- 26:40.360* :  says we are lazy, we say, for example, we are well organized to have time to be lazy sometimes.
*26:43.880- 26:48.360* :  Montenegro may be internationally renowned for its dramatic mountains and beautiful
*26:48.360- 26:54.080* :  Adriatic coastline, but in the neighborhood, it's a different story. When it was part of Yugoslavia,
*26:54.080- 27:00.320* :  its people were the butt of jokes labelled as the laziest in the country. Even Montenegro's current
*27:00.320- 27:05.120* :  prime minister, Greatana Bazavic, played up to the image at a conference with other regional
*27:05.120- 27:12.960* :  leaders in Slovenia last month. We are Euro-optimistic country, country of sun and fun, and because it's
*27:12.960- 27:18.280* :  very good atmosphere, our wish is to give the good weather to extend the tourist season.
*27:21.680- 27:27.580* :  The laziest citizen contest has gone international. In the current edition, competitors from Russia,
*27:27.580- 27:33.940* :  Ukraine and Serbia have all been vying for the title, that is, if vying is the right word for
*27:33.940- 27:39.300* :  relaxing in a prone position on a mattress under the trees or in one of the log cabins.
*27:39.300- 27:45.840* :  21 competitors started with the daydream of going home with the grand prize of a thousand euros.
*27:46.500- 27:52.000* :  Serbia's Yovan Sarnchenin is one of four still standing, lying as the competition
*27:52.000- 27:59.140* :  doodles into its second month. I can assure you that it is very hard to stay lazy this much.
*27:59.140- 28:05.420* :  I actually think that it's more harder to work than to lay down in this state.
*28:05.620- 28:10.460* :  The sedentary, Serbian, favourite Yovan Sarnchenin ending that report by the
*28:10.460- 28:12.180* :  vigorously energetic Guida Lone.
*28:17.320- 28:20.880* :  And that's it from us for now. Remember, if you'd like to be part of the happy pod,
*28:20.880- 28:25.680* :  you can email us with your story or your sound or the small victory that brings you joy,
*28:25.680- 28:33.800* :  as ever the address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk. This edition was mixed by Ricardo McCarthy,
*28:33.800- 28:40.460* :  the producer was Anna Murphy, our editor is Karen Martin, I'm Jackie Leonard and until next time, goodbye.
