*00:23.900- 00:28.020* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:28.020- 00:31.280* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*00:31.560- 00:35.920* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15

*01:01.520- 01:02.660* :  Our low mileage is paying off.
*01:02.720- 01:03.540* :  Our values up.

*01:05.420- 01:07.420* :  Car prices haven't gone up in a couple weeks.

*01:34.420- 01:38.320* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:40.100- 01:44.500* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Saturday, the 23rd of September, these
*01:44.520- 01:45.560* :  are our main stories.
*01:46.120- 01:50.000* :  Ukraine strikes the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in Crimea.
*01:50.540- 01:54.920* :  In the US, leading Democrat Senator Bob Menendez is charged with corruption.
*01:57.280- 02:02.040* :  Also, in this podcast, we were sleeping in everywhere was dark and we were just shooting
*02:02.040- 02:03.560* :  and we did not move it.
*02:03.560- 02:06.900* :  So when they saw it like that, then they moved to the other house and they came in to
*02:07.140- 02:07.900* :  most of them.
*02:08.220- 02:14.600* :  More abductions of students in northern Nigeria and how lawyers in the US are using documentary
*02:14.600- 02:19.700* :  style videos to persuade judges their clients to serve leniency.
*02:23.720- 02:28.900* :  We start with the latest development in the war in Ukraine, a missile attack on the headquarters
*02:29.340- 02:33.200* :  of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean Port of Sevastopol.
*02:36.800- 02:42.340* :  Video images of the aftermath captured police sirens and plumes of smoke coming from the
*02:42.340- 02:43.020* :  main building.
*02:43.460- 02:46.140* :  Russian officials said one serviceman was missing.
*02:46.800- 02:52.320* :  The Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine back in 2014, has been a frequent
*02:52.320- 02:57.400* :  target since the start of the war almost 19 months ago when Russia invaded.
*02:57.960- 03:01.260* :  Vitaly Shepchenko is BBC Monitoring's Russia Editor.
*03:01.640- 03:08.700* :  This is obviously the most significant such attack on Sevastopol so far during this full-scale
*03:09.260- 03:09.680* :  invasion.
*03:10.100- 03:14.520* :  It is almost certain that Ukraine is behind it, even though we have not had a completely
*03:14.520- 03:16.840* :  official statement confirming this.
*03:16.840- 03:23.520* :  The closest we have to it is a telegram post by the head of Ukrainian Air Force who said
*03:23.520- 03:29.160* :  we told you there is going to be more and he thanked Ukrainian pilots for what is happening
*03:29.760- 03:29.940* :  today.
*03:30.440- 03:36.000* :  Of course, his remarks come after Ukraine earlier this month, was able to target Russian
*03:36.000- 03:43.000* :  Navy vessels in a dry dock in Crimea and also to Russian air defense systems.
*03:43.060- 03:51.540* :  So it seems obvious that Ukraine's capability to target Crimea has increased dramatically.
*03:52.000- 03:56.560* :  And does that suggest they have had an input from the West regarding missiles?
*03:57.060- 04:03.540* :  Well, it is possible that Western-supplied missiles such as Britain's Stormshadow or
*04:03.540- 04:10.160* :  the Scalp missile could have been fired from Ukrainian fighter jets, but it is also possible
*04:10.160- 04:16.140* :  that Ukrainian missiles such as the Neptune developed recently, were used in this attack
*04:16.140- 04:16.480* :  as well.
*04:17.100- 04:20.420* :  So how significant is it for both Kiev and indeed Moscow?
*04:21.240- 04:28.320* :  Well, it is usually significant because in practical terms, even though we do not know what
*04:28.320- 04:35.300* :  the impact of this strike is going to be on Russia's operations in the Black Sea, Ukraine
*04:35.300- 04:44.220* :  would be hoping to undermine Russia's ability to fire missiles at Ukraine from ships in the
*04:44.480- 04:45.020* :  Black Sea.
*04:45.020- 04:52.900* :  Also, Russia has been threatening to use its Navy ships to block maritime routes, which Ukraine
*04:52.900- 04:55.000* :  has been using to export grain.
*04:55.500- 05:01.000* :  And thirdly, there were fears, especially in the first few weeks of this invasion, that
*05:01.000- 05:08.560* :  Russia could use Black Sea Fleet ships to mount a land assault on Ukraine's southern Odessa
*05:09.000- 05:09.900* :  and Mikolive regions.
*05:10.000- 05:16.780* :  But symbolically, the Black Sea Fleet is basically at the heart of Russia's military presence
*05:16.780- 05:17.460* :  in the region.
*05:17.460- 05:20.360* :  It is a source of huge pride for Russians.
*05:21.240- 05:26.960* :  And it is something that the Kremlin has used the presence of the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea
*05:26.960- 05:31.980* :  to justify its claim to the Ukrainian peninsula.
*05:32.580- 05:37.820* :  And of course, President Putin has also said that Russia had to take control of Crimea to
*05:37.820- 05:40.880* :  stop the Black Sea Fleet from falling into western hands.
*05:41.260- 05:47.940* :  And when he said that shortly after the annexation in 2014, there was no realistic threat facing
*05:47.940- 05:48.960* :  the Black Sea Fleet.
*05:48.980- 05:55.920* :  And now, the symbol of Russia's military presence in Crimea has suffered a pretty humiliating
*05:55.920- 05:56.300* :  attack.
*05:57.020- 05:58.240* :  Vitaly Shivchenko.
*05:58.980- 06:04.420* :  Julian Marshall got this reaction to the attack on the naval headquarters in Sevastopol from
*06:04.420- 06:09.920* :  a Russian MP, Yevgeti Popov, from President Putin's United Russia party.
*06:10.320- 06:12.820* :  It's war, and we understand it.
*06:13.320- 06:22.340* :  And you should understand that Ukraine is losing this war on a battlefield, politically, and
*06:22.340- 06:26.640* :  in other aspects.
*06:27.660- 06:34.020* :  And of course, it's a challenge for Crimea.
*06:34.060- 06:35.940* :  It's a challenge for Russian people.
*06:35.940- 06:39.160* :  It's a challenge for Russian Black Sea Fleet.
*06:39.840- 06:45.320* :  But we will solve this problem sooner or later.
*06:45.900- 06:52.680* :  And of course, all terrorists who are behind this attack, who are behind this attack,
*06:53.540- 06:55.800* :  will get responsibilities.
*06:56.380- 07:09.120* :  And I don't know exactly how we're going to respond, but you will see it.
*07:09.760- 07:15.920* :  Earlier this year, I think it was in June, your Defence Minister Sergei Shoyugu said that
*07:15.940- 07:24.080* :  if Western supplied missiles were used against targets in Crimea, it would mark the West's
*07:24.080- 07:31.340* :  full involvement in the conflict and would entail immediate strikes upon decision-making
*07:31.340- 07:35.200* :  centers in Ukrainian territory.
*07:35.200- 07:36.520* :  Have we reached that point?
*07:38.480- 07:38.860* :  I don't know.
*07:39.200- 07:42.580* :  I'm not a military guy, but I'm a politician and journalist.
*07:42.580- 07:47.160* :  And my Minister of Defence was pretty clear.
*07:47.900- 07:54.400* :  And of course, it will be some response to important targets in Ukraine.
*07:55.260- 08:02.240* :  But this attack can't change the situation on the battlefield.
*08:03.020- 08:04.180* :  Yevgeti Popov.
*08:05.200- 08:10.100* :  In the United States, a high-profile Democrat Senator has been charged over a bribery
*08:10.100- 08:11.140* :  and corruption scandal.
*08:11.700- 08:17.180* :  Prosecutors of accused New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez and his wife of helping three Egyptian
*08:17.180- 08:19.660* :  businessmen in exchange for bribes.
*08:20.100- 08:24.200* :  At a news conference, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damien
*08:24.200- 08:28.100* :  Williams, gave more details about the FBI's investigation.
*08:28.580- 08:34.340* :  They discovered approximately $500,000 of cash stuffed into envelopes and closets.
*08:35.460- 08:38.020* :  Some of the cash was stuffed in the Senator's jacket pockets.
*08:38.880- 08:42.980* :  Some of the envelopes of cash contained Davies fingerprints or Davies DNA.
*08:44.340- 08:44.820* :  That's not all.
*08:45.760- 08:48.140* :  Agents also discovered a lot of gold.
*08:49.000- 08:51.900* :  Gold that was provided by Davies and Hana.
*08:53.000- 08:57.400* :  And the FBI, of course, found the Mercedes-Benz that your rebay had provided them.
*08:58.100- 09:02.920* :  Following the indictment, Senator Menendez has temporarily stepped down from his position
*09:03.260- 09:05.320* :  as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
*09:05.680- 09:10.880* :  We find out more about the charges he faces from our North America correspondent, Nenotovic.
*09:11.220- 09:18.100* :  We know that the three of them were able to allegedly get Menendez to pull his weight
*09:18.820- 09:24.600* :  for them in the government, one of them with the Department of Agriculture to help him
*09:24.900- 09:29.360* :  protect a business monopoly he had that was granted to him by the Egyptian government.
*09:30.000- 09:35.400* :  And the other two, apparently they were facing two different prosecutions by the Department
*09:35.400- 09:36.000* :  of Justice.
*09:36.020- 09:40.900* :  And so Menendez tried to pressure officials there to be lenient on them.
*09:40.900- 09:47.060* :  He tried to even install a prosecutor who could stop those prosecutions going forward.
*09:47.060- 09:52.260* :  This is all allegedly, of course, Menendez himself has said that these are baseless allegations.
*09:53.200- 10:01.940* :  These three businessmen are now going to be obviously a key part of this case going forward.
*10:01.940- 10:06.940* :  They also say though that Menendez gave the Egyptian government sensitive information
*10:07.660- 10:13.160* :  and tried to kind of help them lift a hold on $300 million in aid in the country
*10:13.160- 10:15.640* :  by ghost writing a letter to other senators.
*10:16.560- 10:22.260* :  And as a democratic senator, how damaging could this case be for his party, do you think?
*10:22.260- 10:24.460* :  And indeed, for President Dubai.
*10:24.460- 10:32.220* :  I think it's incredibly important to remember that Senator Menendez has held on to his seat since 2006,
*10:32.220- 10:35.260* :  but he is facing election this year.
*10:35.700- 10:40.180* :  And this is the second bribery trial that he is having to face.
*10:40.180- 10:44.360* :  The last one ended up with a deadlock jury, so he was ultimately acquitted.
*10:44.900- 10:50.280* :  But this is at a time when a lot of people are showing discontent with the amount of influence
*10:50.280- 10:54.940* :  in power senators have by staying in power for so long.
*10:54.940- 10:57.400* :  There's a big debate here in the United States about term limits.
*10:58.020- 11:02.260* :  So the Democrats have a very narrow majority in the Senate at the moment,
*11:02.980- 11:04.520* :  along with the independents who vote with them.
*11:04.520- 11:08.000* :  There are 51 seats to 49 Republican members in the Senate.
*11:08.900- 11:09.700* :  Neutotophic.
*11:10.400- 11:14.940* :  The public prosecutor's office in Paris has recommended that the French far-right leader,
*11:14.940- 11:20.620* :  Marie Le Pen, should face trial over the alleged misuse of European Union funds.
*11:20.740- 11:25.900* :  The call for criminal charges follows a seven-year investigation as Paddy McGuire reports.
*11:26.440- 11:27.880* :  Marie Le Pen is not alone.
*11:27.900- 11:32.800* :  The prosecutor also accuses more than 20 other members of her National Rally Party
*11:32.800- 11:36.000* :  of similar systematic breaches of EU rules.
*11:36.060- 11:43.020* :  That between 2004 and 2016, they used money allocated to EU parliamentary assistance
*11:43.020- 11:48.560* :  to instead pay staff working for their own party, known at the time as the National Front.
*11:48.660- 11:52.740* :  The National Rally Party and Miss Le Pen have denied any wrongdoing.
*11:52.740- 11:56.620* :  Judges will decide whether to take the case forward if they do.
*11:56.620- 12:00.420* :  She could face a 10-year jail sentence and a $1 million fine.
*12:01.240- 12:01.980* :  Paddy McGuire.
*12:02.860- 12:08.240* :  Lawyers in the US are using short documentary-style videos about their clients' lives
*12:08.520- 12:14.460* :  to try and persuade judges, juries, and prosecutors to look beyond the charges and see the accused
*12:14.840- 12:18.220* :  as people deserving of redemption and even leniency.
*12:18.800- 12:23.760* :  Tombrook now reports from New York where lawyers are claiming these so-called mitigation videos
*12:24.400- 12:26.000* :  lead to reduced sentences.
*12:32.560- 12:37.560* :  As passengers take off from New York's La Guadier Airport, often en route to exotic locations,
*12:37.560- 12:42.520* :  they will, within less than a minute, fly over a very different destination, Reicas Island,
*12:42.540- 12:44.500* :  the city's largest jail.
*12:44.500- 12:49.260* :  It earns the reputation of being the most dangerous place to be incarcerated in America.
*12:49.980- 12:55.300* :  It was from Reicas Island that Augusta Gussie Clay, suffering from cystic fibrosis and cancer,
*12:55.760- 12:59.340* :  spoke by phone to his lawyers amid growing concern of COVID infection.
*12:59.620- 13:02.800* :  People waking up from what they can't breathe, they need to go to the asking.
*13:03.080- 13:03.840* :  They never return.
*13:04.080- 13:07.600* :  I am afraid of dying and cooking from a disease that I don't know about.
*13:08.380- 13:12.320* :  At certain Clay's phone call were used in what's called a mitigation video,
*13:12.320- 13:17.760* :  a collection of interviews and images put together by his legal team to help persuade a judge
*13:17.760- 13:18.940* :  to release him early.
*13:19.280- 13:20.940* :  He was serving a 12-month sentence,
*13:20.940- 13:25.180* :  violating his parole after pleading guilty to attempted robbery in the third degree,
*13:25.580- 13:26.480* :  a low-level felony.
*13:26.840- 13:27.580* :  All right, rolling.
*13:27.580- 13:30.740* :  And first, could you give him one loud clap?
*13:32.260- 13:36.420* :  Better in New York filmmaker, David Simpson makes these mitigation videos.
*13:36.900- 13:45.520* :  A mitigation video encapsulates the life and history of a client to show an individual as a
*13:45.640- 13:50.520* :  full human being with the hopes that we're building empathy.
*13:51.080- 13:55.740* :  So in Clay's mitigation video, there were photos of him caring for loved ones and testimony
*13:55.740- 14:00.460* :  from his longtime partner, Tanisha Burke, presenting him in the best possible light.
*14:00.780- 14:05.200* :  I love him. Always so sweet, generous, kind to the family.
*14:05.200- 14:09.100* :  The first to give and the last to receive always.
*14:09.500- 14:14.300* :  I began to see these mitigation videos being used for wealthier clients in federal court.
*14:14.520- 14:18.560* :  Nicole Mull leads the video mitigation project at the Legal Aid Society,
*14:18.560- 14:22.140* :  America's oldest and largest law firm for low-income individuals.
*14:22.660- 14:24.120* :  It represented Gussie Clay.
*14:24.400- 14:29.360* :  I always felt that if the judge were to hear from our clients,
*14:29.360- 14:34.280* :  they would learn a lot about them, who they are, the humans that they are, what drives them,
*14:34.580- 14:38.680* :  and what we should be doing as society rather than incarcerate them.
*14:41.280- 14:45.700* :  Some mitigation videos use music and play on sentiment to try to influence a judge.
*14:46.480- 14:50.120* :  Although she champions the use of mitigation videos, Regina Austin,
*14:50.120- 14:53.220* :  director of the Penn program on documentaries and the law,
*14:53.620- 14:56.600* :  warns they shouldn't aim to manipulate with music.
*14:56.980- 15:01.660* :  A bad mitigation video attempts to pull off the heartstrings.
*15:01.660- 15:05.360* :  I want a video to be used to enlighten.
*15:05.540- 15:11.340* :  We have in our minds eye notions of what criminals look like.
*15:11.340- 15:17.280* :  Mitigation videos can try and change that image in the mind by providing context.
*15:17.280- 15:22.680* :  But in a country where there's an intense debate over whether inmate should be punished or rehabilitated,
*15:22.680- 15:25.600* :  there are critics opposed to mitigation videos.
*15:25.600- 15:30.320* :  Jennifer Harrison is executive director of the Victims Rights Reform Council.
*15:30.680- 15:36.380* :  It's absolutely infuriating and it's just another slap in the face to victims because once again,
*15:36.380- 15:40.560* :  all empathy and emphasis is placed on the criminal.
*15:40.780- 15:43.960* :  I don't necessarily have a problem with the videos in itself.
*15:44.200- 15:47.080* :  There are some mitigating issues in certain cases,
*15:47.360- 15:51.300* :  but if they're going to be allowed to use these videos for the criminals,
*15:51.300- 15:54.120* :  then victims should have that same luxury.
*15:54.120- 15:59.760* :  But legal aid points out that victims in New York can deliver impact statements at sentencing.
*15:59.760- 16:04.000* :  They submitted Gussie Clay's video to an attorney general and a judge
*16:04.300- 16:07.260* :  along with documents containing legal arguments for review.
*16:07.900- 16:10.420* :  Clay was released two months early.
*16:10.880- 16:13.500* :  Within a year, though, he died from his chronic diseases.
*16:13.960- 16:15.580* :  Although there's no absolute proof,
*16:15.580- 16:20.340* :  his legal team believed it was the mitigation video that got him out of Rikers Island.
*16:20.420- 16:24.240* :  There are no hard figures on how common mitigation videos are,
*16:24.240- 16:28.240* :  but in a country that has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world,
*16:28.700- 16:31.040* :  they are increasingly being seen by lawyers
*16:31.440- 16:35.760* :  as an effective tool that can often reduce jail sentences.
*16:36.620- 16:37.120* :  Tom Brook

*16:41.780- 16:46.240* :  the Pope says it's a duty of humanity to rescue migrants
*16:46.240- 16:48.540* :  attempting to cross the Mediterranean,
*16:49.140- 16:51.940* :  which he described as an enormous cemetery.

*18:13.560- 18:16.600* :  I had just come out of one of my bare-knuckle boxing matches.
*18:16.820- 18:21.760* :  I don't know why, but the first thing that came to my brain was what if I do a drag show?
*18:21.980- 18:25.800* :  Remarkable personal stories told by the people that lived them.
*18:26.020- 18:29.320* :  I could easily have pulled that trigger, but that was not my brief.
*18:29.780- 18:32.640* :  I was not an assassin. I was not told to do that.
*18:32.900- 18:34.560* :  I was not told to murder him.

*18:42.500- 18:46.440* :  Over the last few years Nigeria has faced an outbreak of kidnappings,
*18:46.440- 18:50.580* :  as roving gangs seize people from villages, highways and farms,
*18:51.040- 18:53.400* :  and demanded ransom payments from their relatives.
*18:54.140- 18:58.420* :  The kidnapping of students was used by islamist militants to intimidate the population,
*18:58.420- 19:02.360* :  but it's now become a money-spinning industry for armed gangs.
*19:03.120- 19:07.300* :  In the latest case, gunmen have abducted a number of female university students
*19:07.300- 19:09.600* :  from Northwestern Zamfire State.
*19:09.620- 19:12.360* :  This girl managed to avoid capture.
*19:12.860- 19:15.680* :  We were sleeping around through everywhere was dark,
*19:16.240- 19:20.340* :  and we were just shooting out like 10 minutes and we did not move it, not doing it.
*19:20.420- 19:22.740* :  So when they saw it like that, then they moved to the other house.
*19:22.740- 19:27.460* :  They came in, they broke the windows, and they came in to most of them.
*19:27.960- 19:32.660* :  Azizat Ola Oluwa from the BBC's House of Service in Abuja told me more.
*19:32.980- 19:36.640* :  Local media is saying that 24 female students were abducted,
*19:36.640- 19:40.480* :  and 10 to 11 other university staff as well.
*19:40.480- 19:45.240* :  What we know at this time is that about six of those that were abducted
*19:45.520- 19:49.720* :  have been rescued by joint military efforts of the Nigerian military police,
*19:49.720- 19:53.380* :  and some local vigilantes, and rescue operation is still ongoing,
*19:53.380- 19:58.820* :  and the government is expected to all as been asked by a number of activists,
*19:58.820- 20:03.680* :  and also I'm listening to national to do everything to ensure the speedy rescue
*20:03.680- 20:07.940* :  of those that have been taken away, because the longer this continues,
*20:07.940- 20:10.240* :  and the longer the rescue operation continues, rather,
*20:10.620- 20:13.780* :  the more difficult is going to be to get these students,
*20:13.780- 20:16.960* :  and the other people abducted will be.
*20:17.180- 20:18.900* :  And what do we know about the kidnappers?
*20:18.900- 20:20.240* :  Have we heard anything from them?
*20:20.540- 20:24.660* :  There is no official statement from any group, so far,
*20:24.660- 20:27.500* :  but we know that banditry is a huge problem.
*20:27.500- 20:31.400* :  It's in northwestern Nigeria, and especially in Zanfer State.
*20:31.400- 20:34.440* :  So maybe it's because the rescue operation is still ongoing,
*20:34.440- 20:38.280* :  so pretty much security officials are still on the tail of these doctors,
*20:38.280- 20:40.960* :  so maybe they've not been able to settle down in one place,
*20:40.960- 20:43.660* :  and they'll be able to make a statement of something.
*20:44.220- 20:47.460* :  As you said, it's not the first time this has happened in Zanfer State.
*20:47.460- 20:49.340* :  Why is it such a problem there?
*20:49.700- 20:54.880* :  Interesting that, not just Zanfer, now the entire northwestern Nigeria
*20:54.880- 20:59.980* :  is known to be saturated with stories of banditry almost every day,
*20:59.980- 21:03.800* :  but particularly in Zanfer, and that's due to what people could say,
*21:03.960- 21:07.920* :  maybe the continuous conflict between farmers and pastoralists,
*21:08.220- 21:12.380* :  and then the poorest body is playing a huge role in all of this,
*21:12.380- 21:14.620* :  because the former Minister of Information I recall
*21:14.620- 21:18.620* :  said that because of the poorest body in the northern part of Nigeria,
*21:18.620- 21:22.520* :  that has encouraged a lot of arms, illegal arms,
*21:22.520- 21:25.300* :  coming into that region of the country,
*21:25.300- 21:29.500* :  and then fearling illegal activities like this banditry.
*21:29.780- 21:33.540* :  And of course, Zanfer, again, is known to be a place
*21:33.540- 21:35.720* :  where illegal mining is going on,
*21:36.000- 21:37.560* :  and you know when there is illegal mining,
*21:37.560- 21:39.760* :  it means that there may be armed criminal gangs there,
*21:39.760- 21:42.220* :  trying to maybe, you know, still depressure stones that
*21:42.220- 21:43.260* :  miners are taking out of it.
*21:43.260- 21:47.860* :  So there is a mix-back of factors that is making banditry
*21:47.860- 21:49.760* :  to be a problem, not just in Zanfer State,
*21:49.760- 21:51.420* :  but in northwestern Nigeria.
*21:52.040- 21:53.680* :  Azizat Ola Olua
*21:54.800- 21:57.500* :  Pope Francis is making the first papal visit
*21:57.500- 22:00.560* :  to the French city of Marseille in five centuries.
*22:00.580- 22:03.900* :  At the beginning of a two-day visit to the Mediterranean Port,
*22:03.940- 22:07.260* :  he said it was a duty of humanity to rescue migrants,
*22:07.260- 22:10.980* :  attempting the sea crossing from North Africa into Europe.
*22:15.580- 22:19.040* :  Too many people fleeing from conflict, poverty,
*22:19.720- 22:21.260* :  and environmental disasters
*22:21.980- 22:24.120* :  find in the waves of the Mediterranean
*22:24.880- 22:28.960* :  the definitive rejection of their search for a better future.
*22:29.900- 22:34.320* :  And so this splendid sea has become an enormous cemetery
*22:35.200- 22:38.160* :  where many brothers and sisters are deprived
*22:38.160- 22:41.060* :  even of the right to have a tomb.
*22:41.920- 22:44.800* :  So how are these strong words from Pope Francis
*22:45.060- 22:46.160* :  likely to be received?
*22:46.180- 22:49.340* :  Chris Bachmann is a journalist based in the South of France.
*22:49.860- 22:51.380* :  They have been well received in Marseille,
*22:51.380- 22:53.140* :  but they won't be well received by everyone,
*22:53.140- 22:53.900* :  that's for sure.
*22:54.400- 22:59.740* :  As you know, around 12,000 migrants turned up on the island of Lampedusa
*23:00.000- 23:02.260* :  in just off Italy in the last few weeks.
*23:02.720- 23:04.880* :  The French government made it clear that none of them,
*23:05.200- 23:07.320* :  absolutely none of them, will be welcomed in France.
*23:08.180- 23:12.620* :  As you also know, around 45% of the French electorate voted for the far right
*23:12.620- 23:13.980* :  of the last presidential elections.
*23:13.980- 23:16.100* :  So it's a very divisive issue of migration.
*23:16.740- 23:19.000* :  Marseille, of course, he hasn't chosen it by coincidence.
*23:19.560- 23:21.280* :  It's a city that's built on migrations.
*23:21.280- 23:23.480* :  So what he said will go down well there,
*23:23.860- 23:25.600* :  but not necessarily with the rest of the country.
*23:26.040- 23:27.600* :  And what else is he doing in this trip?
*23:28.340- 23:31.280* :  Indeed, he's held holding a mass at the velodrome,
*23:31.280- 23:33.880* :  which people who know football knows the amazing stadium there,
*23:34.000- 23:36.100* :  which can hold up to about 45,000 people.
*23:36.420- 23:37.200* :  And it will be packed.
*23:37.580- 23:39.920* :  And he's also meeting President Macron in a private talk
*23:39.920- 23:43.040* :  where clearly migration will be raised by both of them.
*23:43.280- 23:45.700* :  And he made it clear that he wasn't coming to France.
*23:45.800- 23:46.560* :  There's a pep Francis.
*23:46.560- 23:48.180* :  He said he was coming to Marseille
*23:48.420- 23:51.540* :  because he said that this is about linking the North Bank
*23:51.540- 23:53.660* :  and the South Bank of the Mediterranean as they called it.
*23:54.040- 23:55.180* :  And he said that basically,
*23:55.180- 23:57.920* :  a lot of his people who are priests in North Africa
*23:57.960- 24:00.480* :  are telling him that the migrants who are trying to get across
*24:00.480- 24:03.700* :  across the Mediterranean are being held in atrocious conditions
*24:04.300- 24:05.860* :  and his up to countries like France
*24:06.260- 24:07.620* :  to do something about it so that they're not
*24:07.620- 24:08.820* :  kept in those atrocious conditions.
*24:08.900- 24:12.820* :  So there'll be frank talks between the French president and pep Francis.
*24:13.560- 24:14.180* :  Chris Bachmann.
*24:15.000- 24:16.900* :  Pakistan's caretaker prime minister,
*24:16.900- 24:21.840* :  and well, a hacker has urged donors to release billions of dollars in pledges
*24:22.060- 24:25.400* :  to help it recover from last year's catastrophic floods,
*24:25.760- 24:28.760* :  thought to be one of the world's costliest natural disasters.
*24:29.380- 24:33.040* :  Over 1,700 people died and 8 million were displaced.
*24:33.680- 24:34.980* :  More from Electronicsmith.
*24:35.520- 24:37.200* :  From June to October last year,
*24:37.200- 24:39.460* :  Pakistan suffered its worst ever floods,
*24:39.780- 24:42.100* :  driven said scientists by climate change.
*24:42.660- 24:44.260* :  Donors, including the World Bank,
*24:44.260- 24:46.600* :  promised some 10 billion dollars to help.
*24:46.600- 24:50.580* :  But the country's caretaker prime minister says it hasn't materialized.
*24:50.940- 24:53.200* :  The money is crucial for cash drive Pakistan.
*24:53.740- 24:56.040* :  A much needed IMF bailout has been delayed
*24:56.040- 24:58.740* :  due to concerns over a lack of fiscal reform.
*24:59.280- 25:01.360* :  Government instability hasn't helped either,
*25:01.620- 25:04.040* :  a possible reason for the cash not turning up.
*25:04.500- 25:07.820* :  And while Al-Hakka, who's in New York for the UN General Assembly,
*25:07.820- 25:11.680* :  says his government is trying to ensure the money is dispersed to Pakistan
*25:11.680- 25:14.200* :  and spent on those directly affected.
*25:14.880- 25:15.740* :  Electronicsmith.
*25:16.680- 25:19.260* :  YouTubers now rank as some of the most famous
*25:19.260- 25:21.140* :  and influential people in the world,
*25:21.520- 25:24.040* :  often better known than some Hollywood stars,
*25:24.540- 25:26.280* :  and they're making a lot of money.
*25:26.280- 25:31.540* :  They added more than $3.5 billion to the UK's economy last year.
*25:32.240- 25:35.140* :  Daniel Middleton, known online as Dan TDM,

*25:38.040- 25:40.140* :  famous for his video game commentaries.
*25:40.700- 25:43.140* :  The 31-year-old has posted thousands of videos

*25:45.840- 25:48.800* :  reaching more than 34 million subscribers

*25:58.500- 26:00.940* :  I've been playing video games ever since I was young.
*26:00.940- 26:02.120* :  The views were just ridiculous.
*26:02.120- 26:05.680* :  We are going to be doing the diamond minecart experiment.
*26:05.840- 26:08.740* :  We hit the most viewed channel on the entire site.
*26:08.900- 26:10.040* :  I still look back on it just like that.
*26:10.600- 26:11.040* :  That's crazy.
*26:11.520- 26:12.060* :  Get in there.
*26:12.740- 26:16.700* :  At one point, Dan TDM was the most watched YouTuber in the world.
*26:16.700- 26:20.300* :  For more than a decade, he's made videos about gaming from his house,
*26:20.680- 26:22.240* :  that turned a boy from older shot

*26:49.300- 26:50.380* :  I was really shy at school,
*26:50.600- 26:51.960* :  like you wouldn't catch me doing anything like this.
*26:51.960- 26:55.480* :  A lot of YouTubers are naturally introverted, but very creative.
*26:56.040- 26:59.200* :  As you can see, it's set up like a movie, like there's camera angles.
*27:00.620- 27:03.660* :  What did you think when you realised how much money could be made from this?
*27:03.800- 27:04.520* :  I couldn't really believe it.
*27:04.560- 27:06.880* :  I mean, I wasn't really using it because I was making videos.
*27:07.100- 27:09.560* :  I was in a lucky position where I started at the right time.
*27:10.240- 27:12.860* :  YouTube just grew exponentially over that time,
*27:12.860- 27:16.620* :  so a platform of that many eyes on it is going to make money.
*27:20.820- 27:24.200* :  Dan was his own production house, making two videos every day.
*27:24.860- 27:27.780* :  With anything when it's growing, it gets a little bit addicted if you're like,
*27:28.100- 27:30.640* :  oh, I can keep uploading and then try out new things,
*27:30.640- 27:32.280* :  see if they work, see if they don't.
*27:32.380- 27:34.820* :  Can you walk out the door and not be recognised,
*27:34.820- 27:37.060* :  or are you somebody who gets recognised and has the wherever hat?
*27:37.320- 27:38.480* :  I literally happens every day.
*27:38.800- 27:41.960* :  I have made a lot of videos, a lot of them.
*27:41.980- 27:46.620* :  age 31, this year, Dan TDM announced a scaling back for making videos.
*27:47.140- 27:51.460* :  He's been open about struggling with depression after becoming a parent during the pandemic.
*27:51.780- 27:54.640* :  I think if you're making content of that rate,
*27:54.640- 27:59.980* :  whether it's YouTube, even if you're like a musician or a playwright or a writer,
*27:59.980- 28:01.580* :  if you're doing something every day,
*28:03.000- 28:05.440* :  you're going to burn out at some point and need a break.
*28:05.760- 28:08.840* :  Do you feel like you're taken seriously as a creator?
*28:09.480- 28:12.000* :  It did take a long time because people thought, oh,
*28:12.280- 28:15.740* :  they see the 20 minute video, you just record every 20 minutes, uploaded it, that's it.
*28:15.900- 28:17.640* :  But now I think there is that respect there.
*28:17.800- 28:19.700* :  If you're successful in the platform, you're doing something right,
*28:19.700- 28:21.640* :  you are creative or you're just good at what you do.
*28:24.480- 28:27.600* :  Dan sells out arenas, a British success story.
*28:27.960- 28:31.380* :  At a time when the internet has become more and more central to our lives.
*28:34.680- 28:38.040* :  Katie Razzle talking there to YouTuber Daniel Middleton.
*28:39.220- 28:42.080* :  More than 140 years after his death,
*28:42.080- 28:47.100* :  a lock of hair from an Ethiopian prince has been handed over to the Ethiopian authorities.
*28:47.800- 28:53.140* :  Prince Alamayo was taken at the age of seven by British soldiers in 1868,
*28:53.640- 28:56.100* :  after his father, the emperor, was defeated in battle.
*28:56.760- 29:00.400* :  Our Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton was at the ceremony in London
*29:00.800- 29:05.220* :  when the royal's hair was presented to Ethiopia's ambassador in the UK.
*29:05.680- 29:08.580* :  It was a traumatic moment in the history of Ethiopia,
*29:08.580- 29:13.180* :  then known as Abbasinia, an expedition of British forces
*29:14.020- 29:17.280* :  defeated those of Emperor Tildros at the Battle of Magdala.
*29:18.000- 29:21.320* :  Rather than be captured, Tildros chose to kill himself.
*29:22.100- 29:26.520* :  A British army captain, Tristram Speedy, who'd been a friend of the Emperor,
*29:26.980- 29:31.840* :  took his seven-year-old son Alamayo under his wing and back to Britain.
*29:32.660- 29:36.140* :  Queen Victoria saw to it that he was educated here,
*29:36.560- 29:40.640* :  but Alamayo caught pluracy and died when he was just 18.
*29:41.480- 29:47.140* :  The captain's descendants who live in New Zealand flew to Britain to hand over the lock of hair
*29:47.140- 29:54.800* :  on Thursday. Alula Pankhurst is a member of the Ethiopian National Heritage Restitution Committee.
*29:55.280- 29:59.620* :  It's really very touching that this family has brought this lock of hair
*29:59.920- 30:03.940* :  all the way 9,000 kilometres from New Zealand to this ceremony,
*30:03.940- 30:07.320* :  because they felt it would be better, more significant,
*30:07.740- 30:13.820* :  create something that would inspire young people and interest people in the history,
*30:14.520- 30:21.180* :  and not just Alamayo's hair, but also in the envelope was a lock of Captain Speedy's hair.
*30:21.180- 30:24.880* :  They've travelled all the way to Britain, all the way to New Zealand,
*30:24.880- 30:28.200* :  back to Britain, and we'll go back to Ethiopia.
*30:28.200- 30:31.080* :  It's a very touching and moving tribute.
*30:31.620- 30:35.740* :  There have been calls for Alamayo's body to be repatriated as well,
*30:35.780- 30:42.620* :  but Buckingham Palace has said removing his remains could affect others buried in the catacombs
*30:42.780- 30:48.420* :  of St. George's Chapel in Windsor. Other items that were handed over at the ceremony in London
*30:48.420- 30:56.200* :  included a sacred tablet or tablet considered a huge significance to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.
*30:57.000- 31:00.360* :  The British Museum currently holds 10 tablets.
*31:01.020- 31:06.120* :  Paul Warteng is a former British cabinet minister and member of the Upper House of Parliament,
*31:06.120- 31:11.280* :  the House of Lords. He's been campaigning for the tablets to be returned to Ethiopia.
*31:12.060- 31:18.740* :  All these objects are of huge significance in Ethiopia, but also to Africa.
*31:19.260- 31:22.680* :  The fact of the matter is that they were looted, they were stolen,
*31:23.480- 31:27.940* :  and they're now being given back. And that's an example, an example to all,
*31:28.620- 31:33.740* :  including the British Museum, which is the biggest depository of stolen goods in the world.
*31:33.740- 31:38.860* :  They're failure to be accountable. They're failure to be transparent.
*31:39.460- 31:43.180* :  They're failure to address these issues openly and publicly.
*31:43.180- 31:45.280* :  It's frankly a national disgrace.
*31:45.920- 31:50.760* :  Across Europe, several former colonial powers, such as France and Germany,
*31:50.760- 31:54.260* :  have begun to return precious artifacts to Africa.
*31:54.940- 31:59.200* :  The British Museum is still reluctant to be part of that growing movement,
*31:59.860- 32:02.820* :  although it has suggested lending them to Addis Habibur.
*32:03.460- 32:06.800* :  But gestures like this, giving a lock of imperial hair,
*32:07.180- 32:12.800* :  and a sacred object back to Ethiopia, will increase the pressure on the institution.
*32:13.900- 32:14.640* :  Richard Hamilton.
*32:16.480- 32:20.500* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new addition of the global news podcast later.
