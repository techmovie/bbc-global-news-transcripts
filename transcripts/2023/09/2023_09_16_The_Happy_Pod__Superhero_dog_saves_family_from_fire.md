*01:07.100- 01:11.300* :  This is Andrew Peach in London and for this week's happy pod, I'm joined by Sheila and Chris
*01:11.300- 01:17.720* :  in Texas with news of a superhero dog. Oh my goodness. Moose is the most amazing dog. He literally
*01:17.720- 01:24.580* :  saved our lives. We woke up. Moose alerted Chris and Anya. They quickly got up and let him out
*01:24.580- 01:29.820* :  and it was at that time they realized that our neighbor's boat was on fire. We were living on a
*01:29.820- 01:35.000* :  boat in Virginia and our neighbor's fire had quickly spread to our boat after we got off the boat.
*01:35.160- 01:37.940* :  Moose truly is a hero. He saved our lives.
*01:42.020- 01:47.180* :  Also on the way, the bra that can spot breast cancer inspired by the aunt of its designer.
*01:47.500- 01:54.760* :  I was sitting by her bedside while she was living her last 12 days. It's a piece of paper in my
*01:54.760- 02:00.720* :  hand and I was drawing an electronic bra and she loved the idea. The witty-to-poo sketch that could
*02:00.720- 02:05.640* :  be worth tens of thousands of dollars. This wasn't in the library on the wall and they found this
*02:05.640- 02:11.420* :  in a salad drawer in a taped-up frame in an old tea towel where it seems to have languished for
*02:11.420- 02:16.620* :  possibly decades. And if you're swimming 50 kilometres in the sea, who do you talk to?
*02:16.880- 02:19.960* :  I talked to the jellyfish as well so I'm sorry if you're going under me that but that's quite
*02:19.960- 02:24.920* :  good fun and I love looking at the nature. It's lovely. Those stories on the way in the happy pod.
*02:28.700- 02:33.720* :  First they're back to Texas and the dog who came to stay on a houseboat owned by Sheila and Chris
*02:33.720- 02:39.620* :  for a few days. Lucky he did because in that time he saved the whole family from a fire. He now
*02:39.620- 02:45.200* :  has a new permanent home in Franklin with Siora. So what kind of dog is he? Moose is a great
*02:45.200- 02:52.060* :  Pyrenees, a great big white dog. His personality was just the best. Actually, I'm not really a big
*02:52.060- 02:57.180* :  dog person honestly, but we needed something fun for the kids to do because they were kind of
*02:57.180- 03:02.240* :  being grumpy. So I'd heard about this program where you could check out a dog for the day and
*03:02.240- 03:07.560* :  that's all we were going to do and we walked past a lot of dogs who were very loud in there.
*03:07.560- 03:13.700* :  It's a long quarter of dogs and when we got to the end was Moose and he was just chilling out
*03:13.700- 03:19.780* :  and kind of had a smile on his face and was like, hey what's going on guys? Just a gentle giant is
*03:19.780- 03:23.760* :  the best way I can think of to describe him. Of course we lived on a boat. We knew we would never
*03:23.760- 03:29.920* :  be able to adopt Moose full time, but the leash from the Humane Society says, please adopt me.
*03:30.640- 03:35.940* :  Every person that came by rubbed his head. He's just that kind of really approachable dog.
*03:35.940- 03:42.740* :  He sounds a dream I have to say. Now tell me about how Moose saved you at home. You've taken him
*03:42.740- 03:47.840* :  in just for a short period of time. What happened? Moose came home for a second night on the boat and
*03:47.840- 03:51.920* :  it was going to be his last night with us and woke up early on Sunday morning. Much earlier
*03:51.920- 03:57.960* :  than we would normally get up and he got my daughter and myself up and he had us get off the boat
*03:58.080- 04:03.260* :  and that's when we noticed that the boat next to us was on fire and we went immediately back on
*04:03.260- 04:07.520* :  the boat and got everyone awake and we were able to evacuate the boat and it happened really
*04:07.520- 04:12.920* :  quickly in terms of how flammable everything was. The fire spread and became a really big inferno
*04:12.920- 04:18.340* :  within a matter of minutes. The truth of the matter is if Moose had not gotten us up,
*04:18.420- 04:23.720* :  the fire came in right where the kids were asleep. So it just really would have been a catastrophic
*04:23.720- 04:29.320* :  situation. Moose truly is a hero. He saved our lives. I like having some kind of guardian angel.
*04:29.320- 04:36.120* :  Yes. I'd like to think that. Yes. Obviously Moose saved you and you got a lot to deal with,
*04:36.120- 04:41.500* :  but you still had the whole situation of Moose being adopted. And that's where you come in
*04:41.800- 04:47.140* :  Ciora. How did you first come across Moose? This is this incredible dog. My husband and I were
*04:47.620- 04:52.880* :  hanging out on our back deck around the pool and I was scrolling through of my phone and I saw
*04:52.880- 04:58.900* :  the Humane Society had made a post saying that he had been returned to the shelter because his
*04:58.900- 05:04.720* :  adoption just didn't work out. So when I told him that he had been returned, first thing he said
*05:04.720- 05:12.320* :  me was, well, go get him. And I was like, all right. So that's exactly what I did. And he just fit
*05:12.320- 05:18.220* :  right on in with everybody from the moment that they were introduced. So we have seven other dogs,
*05:18.220- 05:23.640* :  not including him. He made eight. Excellent. That sounds like quite a collection for Moose to fit
*05:23.640- 05:28.500* :  into. Sounds like a pretty good home shooter, doesn't it? Oh my gosh. We couldn't be more thrilled.
*05:28.760- 05:35.680* :  One of the first pictures we saw that Ciora posted was Moose by the pool. And there he was on this
*05:35.680- 05:41.380* :  five-acre farm chilling out by the pool. And I said, yes, this is exactly the kind of life
*05:41.880- 05:47.040* :  that Moose deserves. It sounds like you got a visitation ride sorted though. We hope so. We can't
*05:47.040- 05:53.280* :  wait to come visit the farm. Absolutely. Sounds like you need like a framed photo of Moose
*05:53.280- 05:58.880* :  somewhere around you until you get to go and see him. Yes, exactly. It's amazing. You know how
*05:58.880- 06:05.400* :  when you get a new car, you see that car everywhere. Yes. Well, with Moose, I mean, the number of
*06:05.400- 06:11.000* :  places that use Moose in their name or we saw a moose in Colorado. We were at a national park.
*06:11.000- 06:15.580* :  We saw a moose. We went to a baseball game and one of the players nicknamed was Moose. We just
*06:15.580- 06:20.680* :  kept seeing Moose everywhere. Yes, our lives are forever. We've been we've been Moose.
*06:22.880- 06:27.520* :  Thanks to Sheila, Chris and Ciora in Texas. And there'll be a bit more Moose magic at the end of
*06:27.520- 06:32.960* :  the podcast. The rescue of the American Cava Mark Dickie made the headlines earlier this month.
*06:32.960- 06:37.500* :  Despite being experienced, the 40-year-old got stranded deep inside Turkey's
*06:37.680- 06:43.000* :  Morgia Cave System after becoming seriously ill. He sent this message from a thousand meters
*06:43.000- 06:48.320* :  below ground. It is amazing to see how many people have responded on the surface. I mean,
*06:48.320- 06:53.100* :  it a lot of help to get out of here. So I'm hoping to see many people from many countries
*06:53.100- 07:01.380* :  all coming together. We take care of our own and it's really special to be taken care of.
*07:02.320- 07:06.320* :  And it was indeed the international community of Cava's who joined forces.
*07:06.800- 07:11.380* :  Led by the Croatian Dinko Novosel, head of the European Association of Cave Rescuers.
*07:11.640- 07:17.660* :  We need four hours to reach the location in very, very poor roads. It's very, very far and
*07:17.660- 07:25.880* :  distant place. Cave itself is very deep and technically very demanding to reach the location where
*07:25.880- 07:32.080* :  the casualty was. It's a cave just for elite people like in the climbing if you want to go in
*07:32.080- 07:37.340* :  forever. It's equally the same challenge. And for listeners who aren't familiar with this, when
*07:37.340- 07:42.820* :  you're going into a deep cave like this, an unexplored cave, you leave a rope trail that you can
*07:42.820- 07:48.480* :  then follow back to get out. Yes, you have to rig the cave to put the rope just to reach that side.
*07:49.000- 07:54.560* :  Tell me about the operation to get Mark out because you're there at the entrance to the cave.
*07:54.560- 08:01.380* :  But meantime, the whole global cave in community is involved offering expertise, offering ideas
*08:01.380- 08:07.660* :  about how to get Mark out quickly. Well, this is very demanding operation. We will say never
*08:07.820- 08:12.980* :  seen before. But the big difference is the health problems of Mark. He had strong bleeding.
*08:13.800- 08:20.240* :  Stomach, he lost so much blood and this bleeding did not stop till the end of the rescue operation.
*08:20.740- 08:26.600* :  So, doctors were constantly with Mark because he was not able to eat. So, transfusions were
*08:26.600- 08:33.420* :  necessary, each six, seven hours. And what was also very important that we were in a far distance
*08:33.420- 08:40.440* :  area and logistic was really challenging to build the camp in this area and to provide the
*08:40.440- 08:47.680* :  logistic support for 200 rescuers was really demanding. So, first of all, you've got to get to
*08:47.680- 08:54.060* :  Mark and get medical help to mark inside the cave. Tell me about the process of getting him out.
*08:54.060- 08:59.580* :  How did you get him out? The first was that the doctor should say now he's ready for transport.
*08:59.580- 09:07.220* :  So, very narrow passages just to get out. In total, 57 hours and seven minutes and we could
*09:07.220- 09:13.000* :  see that this is very, very fast. Mark got out of the cave and came back to the camp where you were.
*09:13.680- 09:17.300* :  What conversation did you have with him? How did you feel when he saw him and the whole thing had
*09:17.300- 09:29.300* :  been a success? Well, honestly, he visited me once in my hometown and he somehow,
*09:29.300- 09:33.960* :  my son, he did not want to have friends with something like that, but he felt okay with Mark.
*09:34.080- 09:40.780* :  And they together went in one restaurant and ate a chihuahab chichi. And then I said to Mark,
*09:41.260- 09:45.380* :  you know that I promise that I will rescue to my son because you have to pay him a chihuahab chichi.
*09:45.980- 09:50.820* :  I need chihuahab chichi that we were hearing about there from Dinko as a Croatian type,
*09:51.160- 09:58.240* :  a meat kebab, by the way. Breast screening for early signs of cancer usually relies on mammograms,
*09:58.240- 10:03.780* :  which involve the breast being compressed between two X-ray plates to try to detect abnormalities.
*10:04.160- 10:07.300* :  It's not particularly comfortable, hasn't changed much over the years.
*10:07.780- 10:13.040* :  Now researchers at MIT in the US have designed a wearable ultrasound scanner that can be attached
*10:13.040- 10:18.640* :  to a bra. It takes images of the breast tissue from many different angles, picking up any problem
*10:18.640- 10:24.480* :  at an early stage. Its designer drew inspiration from her late aunt Fatma, who was diagnosed with
*10:24.480- 10:30.180* :  late stage breast cancer at the age of 49. While at her bedside, Cain and Dr. Riven made the
*10:30.180- 10:34.460* :  first drawing of the device that's now a reality. She's been talking to Gareth Barlow.
*10:34.720- 10:41.400* :  When they have this technology at home, it will be a piece of a bra that they wear almost every day,
*10:41.980- 10:49.180* :  and they also have a phone. And this technology will guide you how to take the image, again, with
*10:49.260- 10:55.140* :  just simply clicking a button. And all the time when you get these images, it will be fed to your
*10:55.140- 11:01.320* :  doctor or oncologist. And then if there is a question mark in your breast tissue, then you will be
*11:01.320- 11:09.340* :  cold and ask for an additional screening, which is mammography. So the main goal of this technology
*11:09.720- 11:15.520* :  to avoid the need of frequent screening at hospitals because mammography is very painful,
*11:15.580- 11:22.680* :  and it is radiative. And that's why you cannot have that every single year. And by the time you
*11:22.680- 11:30.660* :  are scanned, almost 55% of high-risk women, survival rate decreases to 22%. But with a simple bra
*11:31.040- 11:36.340* :  and a phone, you will be able to increase the survival rate up to 98%.
*11:37.640- 11:43.640* :  That's a remarkable figure. I'm interested then, and that might be the answer. What motivates you?
*11:43.640- 11:49.240* :  Because improving patient experience, improving survival rates is a huge thing to be able to say
*11:49.240- 11:56.460* :  you do as a course of your work. Yeah, this research is inspired by my late aunt, who passed
*11:56.460- 12:04.520* :  away because of breast cancer. And I was sitting by her bedside while she was living her last 12 days.
*12:04.960- 12:10.040* :  At that time, I was just trying to comfort her with a piece of paper in my hand, and I was drawing
*12:10.040- 12:16.900* :  an electronic bra, and she loved the idea. And she even gave me great feedback. And it was a dream
*12:16.900- 12:23.200* :  on a piece of paper, but now it's real in my hands. And the technology has potential to save 12
*12:23.200- 12:30.360* :  million lives per year globally, like my aunt. So it will be an amazing profound impact, not only for
*12:30.360- 12:35.800* :  patients, as well as for the family members like me. So I'm just hoping that it could help a
*12:35.800- 12:42.180* :  many more woman all around the world. You say the number 12 million in almost the trip of a
*12:42.180- 12:49.660* :  tongue. Do you ever stop at points in your day or on an evening and consider the impact that you
*12:49.660- 12:55.860* :  and your team are making to people's lives? Yeah, I would say like every single morning, when I
*12:55.860- 13:03.620* :  wake up, I have the motivation and patience to work on this technology because I know many,
*13:03.900- 13:11.960* :  people are waiting for this technology, which will make profound impact on society. And we are
*13:11.960- 13:18.960* :  very much excited to make this change in the century. You have the final product, but I have to ask,
*13:19.100- 13:23.180* :  do you still have that piece of paper that you drew that picture on and you shared with your
*13:23.180- 13:30.040* :  aunt all those years ago? I do. And it is in a frame in my drawer, like whenever I have a failure
*13:30.040- 13:37.120* :  in any experience. I hold it in my hands and try to remember that moment so that it can reach
*13:37.120- 13:43.080* :  hard to me and I can go ahead and work again. I even show this to my students whenever they have
*13:43.120- 13:48.180* :  a question mark about anything that we are doing. So I just show them and say, this was dream,
*13:48.180- 13:52.960* :  now it's real. And we can make many more dreams real. So let's go for it.
*13:53.320- 13:58.400* :  The electronic bra that can detect breast cancer. We love it when you get in touch with this,
*13:58.400- 14:03.040* :  with your happy news, from your part of the world or with the sounds that you love to hear.
*14:03.280- 14:05.840* :  I wonder if you can identify this one from Catherine.
*14:20.340- 14:26.820* :  There is no sound that I am so fond of as the song of the moon. As I have lived the broad
*14:26.820- 14:34.040* :  so many times in my life, this sounds reminds me of home, the lake, the forest, and the crisp air.
*14:35.060- 14:41.940* :  At dusk when the moon wails, it says, I'm here. The water is clean enough for me to stay.
*14:42.860- 14:50.100* :  Welcome to your happy place. It's also one of the most Canadian sounds you can hear other than the
*14:50.100- 14:51.880* :  hockey puck on a stick perhaps.
*15:01.460- 15:06.600* :  And the loons from Catherine got us thinking about the sound you love because it reminds you of home.
*15:07.220- 15:11.940* :  Like this one from my colleague Anne-Barrasson Ethoragin, it's an instrument called Another Swarm.
*15:21.700- 15:26.880* :  This is part and parcel of the South Indian culture. This music has been there for centuries
*15:26.880- 15:32.460* :  together. So I grew up listening to this music from my hometown. Every morning,
*15:32.460- 15:37.800* :  a temple nearby will be playing this another Swarm. Early morning, you can't avoid it.
*15:37.800- 15:43.120* :  Sometimes you wonder at five o'clock, oh my god, I can't stop it. But then it becomes part of
*15:43.120- 15:49.060* :  your culture. And you see that being played in religious processions. And also at home,
*15:49.060- 15:54.880* :  like a naming ceremony, or a year piercing ceremony for the kids, or even a housewarming party,
*15:54.880- 16:00.020* :  this music will be part of it, especially during weddings. They play this music. You know what
*16:00.020- 16:04.140* :  happens? It's about a thousand people in the wedding hall. People will be chatting. For the
*16:04.140- 16:08.700* :  children, they will be catching up with their cousins living in another town. Different things
*16:08.700- 16:14.200* :  will be happening. But when this particular music played, then everyone will be focused on
*16:14.200- 16:19.680* :  the bride and the bridegroom. And people will be throwing rice mixed with petals, wishing this
*16:19.680- 16:27.540* :  couple a long life. So this music means always a happy thing, a happy memory whenever someone plays
*16:27.540- 16:33.320* :  this. So it's all sports you basically back. So it's a happy occasion. Yes indeed. In fact,
*16:33.340- 16:38.600* :  this is the instrument which will always associate yourself with the happy thing because the family
*16:38.600- 16:45.180* :  is come together in India. And it is a moment of joy for the families and also for the relatives
*16:45.180- 16:50.800* :  and friends who come there. So whenever it is played, it is a happy memory, which means that
*16:50.800- 16:56.720* :  the music means a lot. So this was played even for my wedding. So it takes me back to that
*16:56.780- 17:02.600* :  scenario. And it's happy music. This is the happy occasion. Some social event, a big event.
*17:03.060- 17:04.140* :  You play this cat in there.
*17:13.220- 17:16.140* :  And Barasthan etharajan transported back to southern India.
*17:20.300- 17:26.460* :  And if there's a sound that reminds you of home, do get in touch global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*17:26.460- 17:33.240* :  email address, global podcast at bbc.co.uk. If you can send us a voice note recording of the sound
*17:33.240- 17:39.160* :  even better. Still to come, we'll go back to Canada for a cycle ride through the foothills of the Rocky
*17:39.160- 17:39.620* :  Mountains.
*17:48.480- 17:53.780* :  I'm Dr. Laurie Santos, host of the Happiness Lab podcast. It's never too late or too early to
*17:53.780- 17:58.200* :  learn how to feel happier. So my new season has well-being tips for you, whether you're aged
*17:58.200- 18:02.900* :  three or a hundred and three. Like six like me. Did I mention I have some amazing co-hosts
*18:02.900- 18:07.720* :  for this season? And do not forget cute and furry. How could I grover? I'll be joined by my
*18:07.720- 18:15.040* :  fabulous friends from Sesame Street. That's us. I'm so excited! Be sure to listen, wherever you get
*18:15.040- 18:19.100* :  your podcast. Oh, I am so excited. This is going to be so magical.
*18:25.680- 18:31.460* :  Heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires, catastrophic consequences from climate change.
*18:31.460- 18:35.860* :  What's going on is this real. The climate question is the podcast exploring our
*18:35.860- 18:40.660* :  planet's changing environment. What we're doing across the world to adapt and respond to it.
*18:40.660- 18:45.840* :  The futures ahead of us are very sensitive to the choices that we make today. If we don't start
*18:45.840- 18:50.940* :  fixing it, we're going to move victims of it. Get engaged. The climate question from the BBC World
*18:50.940- 18:58.720* :  Service. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts. The 53 km swim from Northern Ireland to Scotland
*18:58.720- 19:04.520* :  is considered one of the toughest in the world. Johnny Warnken is the first solo amputee to battle
*19:04.520- 19:09.260* :  the strong currents and the jellyfish to do it. I love open water swimming for a number of reasons.
*19:09.260- 19:15.080* :  One, I love swimming. Two, I love getting out in nature. Three, do you do my sort of
*19:15.420- 19:19.260* :  disabilities? It's one of the only times I'm pretty much pain-freeze when I'm doing normal
*19:19.260- 19:25.920* :  swims out in the water. And four, once you do it, you find a community of people that's really
*19:25.920- 19:30.500* :  quite an exception of anybody. It really doesn't matter what, you know, colour, creed, faith,
*19:30.500- 19:34.940* :  body shape. Everyone is just so welcoming and just wants you to do the swim that makes you
*19:34.940- 19:40.040* :  happy. It doesn't really matter if you swim five metres or five hundred or five miles. No one cares.
*19:40.480- 19:47.940* :  You lost a leg in a car crash. So just describe how you swim. How you swim differently than other
*19:47.940- 19:53.740* :  people might? The bits of me that are missing or that are a bit broken, that matter when swimming
*19:53.740- 19:59.300* :  is, my left leg is missing below the knee. My right ankle is pinned. I nearly lost my right leg
*19:59.300- 20:03.780* :  as well. So my right ankle is pinned and severely arthritic. So I don't get a huge amount of movement
*20:03.780- 20:09.800* :  in the ankle. So they don't get much of a kick to help with buoyancy and propulsion. And then the
*20:09.840- 20:14.620* :  big issue for open water swimming and certainly sea swimming is, is it when I get tipped over onto
*20:14.620- 20:19.420* :  my left. I don't have the mechanics or enough of the mechanics to push down my left leg to push
*20:19.420- 20:24.240* :  me back to right to me. So I'm unbalanced in the water. Think about a bit of insight into this
*20:24.240- 20:29.780* :  because one of my very close friends quadriplegic and smashed a few world records sailing.
*20:30.440- 20:36.240* :  And she used to hate it when people said to her, well, isn't life hard enough? Haven't you
*20:36.240- 20:41.880* :  got enough to deal with without taking on these physical challenges? Give me your take on why
*20:41.880- 20:46.620* :  that's the right thing for you to do. Because why should able body people have all the fun?
*20:46.820- 20:52.020* :  These things are tough swims. The north channel is known as the toughest of the seven classic
*20:52.020- 20:58.600* :  channel swims. So whether you've got legs missing or not is a really tough gig. The fact that I
*20:58.600- 21:02.620* :  live with pain on a daily basis, well, so be it, you know, that's just my life. I would be
*21:02.620- 21:07.700* :  living that if I wasn't swimming. I like being outdoors. I love swimming. I love a challenge
*21:07.700- 21:13.100* :  and I think I can do it. As you were doing the swim, I'm guessing you always thought,
*21:13.720- 21:16.940* :  I'm going to do this. I'm going to conquer this. If you didn't have that kind of mindset,
*21:16.940- 21:23.380* :  the whole thing might be hard to take on. No, you'll be surprised actually. I was two to four.
*21:23.380- 21:27.380* :  I was questioning my Sunday because, you know, I'm not really into the rhythm of the swim,
*21:27.380- 21:32.820* :  not only at the rhythm of my stroke, but the timetable of the day. You know, so there's a routine
*21:32.820- 21:37.220* :  to it all. And then there's just the melodic movement of your arms. You know, some half the swim,
*21:37.460- 21:41.520* :  you don't remember. I certainly don't. I go into a place where I think about literally nothing.
*21:41.820- 21:47.480* :  So really, all you're focusing on is swimming and swimming. And, you know, I love that. I love
*21:47.480- 21:51.240* :  being, you know, and I talk to the jellyfish as well. So you're going under me. That's quite
*21:51.240- 21:55.380* :  good for me. And I love looking at the nature. You know, it's lovely. What do you say to the jellyfish?
*21:55.380- 22:02.560* :  Were you talking to them? Oh, I was, I can't say, I can't say, this is certainly on this. But,
*22:02.600- 22:07.080* :  you know, just just say hello. You go your way and I won't disturb you. Just don't disturb me.
*22:07.660- 22:12.980* :  Johnty swam the North channel in 15 hours, 24 minutes. He's now preparing to compete in the
*22:12.980- 22:18.420* :  ice swimming championships in Romania. The friendship between the children's characters,
*22:18.420- 22:23.620* :  Winnie the Pooh and Piglet is known around the world. A rare, original sketch by the books
*22:23.620- 22:28.500* :  illustrator Ernest Howard Sheppard has been discovered, hidden under a tea towel in a drawer
*22:28.500- 22:33.360* :  in the library of the late businessman and bookshop owner, Christopher Foil. And it could be worth
*22:33.360- 22:37.120* :  tens of thousands of dollars. The auctioneer is Chris Aubrey.
*22:37.340- 22:42.120* :  It's a nice, wistful scene of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet with their backs to us walking
*22:42.160- 22:49.180* :  into the sunset. And it's in the book at the moment when they turn back into toys effectively.
*22:49.680- 22:54.240* :  And the final concluding scene is Winnie the Pooh being dragged up the stairs by Christopher
*22:54.240- 22:59.680* :  Robin bump, bump, bump up to his bed. It's nearly a hundred years old, the original sketch. And
*22:59.720- 23:05.100* :  there can't be too many people from around the world who don't know the characters, but it's
*23:05.160- 23:11.900* :  certainly one of the more iconic images from the series. And we all treasure it. How was it
*23:11.900- 23:16.800* :  discovered? Well, it's quite magical in itself. We're selling the library of Christopher Foil
*23:16.800- 23:22.460* :  from the famous Foil bookshop and a Sir Fabulous library with books going back to the 13th century.
*23:23.000- 23:27.320* :  And this wasn't in the library on a wall, but was found by Christopher's widow,
*23:27.320- 23:33.700* :  Kathy and a bookseller Matthew Butler looking in drawers. And they found this in a salad drawer
*23:33.700- 23:39.480* :  in a taped up frame in an old tea towel where it seems to have languished for possibly decades.
*23:39.840- 23:43.420* :  Well, there's an advert there for wrapping things up and preserving them in tea towels, isn't
*23:43.420- 23:48.380* :  it? Because that seems to have worked for lovely well. Yes, whether it was put there because
*23:48.380- 23:55.200* :  it wasn't light or to keep it safe, we can't guess. So when I looked at it, Kathy said,
*23:55.200- 24:00.580* :  is this original? Do I give it to charity? And I was expecting it to be reproduction,
*24:00.600- 24:06.280* :  but even through the taped glass, I could see this was pen and ink for sure and absolutely genuine
*24:06.280- 24:11.360* :  as I am standing. So that, we know that's how you got hold of it. But do we know how Christopher
*24:11.360- 24:17.620* :  Foil got hold of it? Well, I've had to speculate and it's not certain, but his arms ran the foils
*24:17.620- 24:24.120* :  enterprise and she'd set up a series of foils literary lunches and they had guest speakers.
*24:24.120- 24:30.080* :  So my assumption is that it was perhaps done as a gift by Yates Shepard when he was guest of
*24:30.080- 24:37.200* :  honour at one of the literary lunches back in 1958. The original, most recently, that sold in New
*24:37.200- 24:45.200* :  York for $220,000. We can't find evidence of another original of this specific scene having
*24:45.200- 24:50.420* :  solds before. So we think at a tenth of that price, it's a bargain. I mean, these characters
*24:50.420- 24:58.360* :  are universally known and loved. This is a magical piece which will undoubtedly inspire
*24:59.040- 25:04.940* :  hundreds of collectors worldwide. auctioneer Chris Aubrey on the global news podcast this week,
*25:04.940- 25:10.960* :  we met Roger. Roger listens in Calgary in Canada while doing his morning exercise routine.
*25:11.340- 25:14.220* :  Roger got in touch to share the sound that makes him happy.
*25:15.080- 25:22.920* :  Turn that battery on. It's the sound of an E tandem.
*25:23.440- 25:29.300* :  Well, when I was 12 years old, I learned to ride a two-wheel bike. My brother was way ahead of me.
*25:29.300- 25:34.820* :  He was riding a two wheeler when he was five, but since I was blind, I wasn't totally blind.
*25:34.840- 25:40.580* :  I had a little sight, but after I crashed my mother's bike a couple of times, my father decided
*25:40.580- 25:46.900* :  that she'd get me a tandem. You're introduced to a tandem pretty early on in life. Tell me about
*25:46.900- 25:52.240* :  the tandem that you've got much more recently. Describe it to us. When you get a bit older,
*25:52.240- 25:58.380* :  we were finding that we were struggling to get up the hills. So for my 80th birthday,
*25:58.380- 26:04.580* :  we got an e-bike and we've loved it. And one thing that's happened as a result of getting your
*26:04.580- 26:10.980* :  tandem is it's become a way of spending more time with your son. Well, that's true. Yeah,
*26:10.980- 26:16.820* :  he suggested this back in May. He said, why don't we take it out and visit a couple of the
*26:16.980- 26:22.680* :  many, many brew pumps. And particularly with men, I think this is fair to say,
*26:23.320- 26:29.400* :  sometimes in order to spend time together and chat and catch up, we need to be doing something,
*26:29.400- 26:35.580* :  right? And this is a such a good example of that. This is true. Yeah, we're not into deep discussion
*26:35.580- 26:41.720* :  while we're riding because we're peddling madly along the pathway and he's pretty strong and so
*26:41.720- 26:47.580* :  we get a lot more speed than we do when I'm riding with my wife. When I'm riding with her,
*26:47.580- 26:53.340* :  we tend to be rather sedate. Thanks to Roger. Isabel listens to the podcast in the Swiss
*26:53.420- 26:56.320* :  mountains, but this is the sound that makes her happy.
*27:03.360- 27:08.880* :  And Isabel told me where she recorded it. I was in the North Germany on the Osfriesland
*27:08.880- 27:15.700* :  island of Northern Naive. I was sitting in a beach chair and watching the tide, the waves.
*27:16.540- 27:22.740* :  Then I thought I could record it so I could still hear it when I'm at home. It reminds me of how
*27:22.740- 27:30.580* :  beautiful our planet is and the nature and I find it amazing. And because I live far away from
*27:30.580- 27:37.880* :  the ocean, for me, every time when I'm there, though it is a very special moment. I like
*27:37.880- 27:46.860* :  observing the nature of the ocean, like the animals and the plants. And I like watching the tide
*27:47.720- 27:54.220* :  as it calms and goes and I haven't had much opportunities to observe that and it is very special.
*27:54.660- 28:00.520* :  Thanks to Isabel, global podcast at BBC.co.uk at email address if you'd like to get in touch.
*28:00.520- 28:05.380* :  Now finally, back to Moose, the dog who saves Sheila and Chris from a fire.
*28:07.140- 28:12.920* :  Moose is a dog that will steal your heart away. And by the end of the song, you learn how
*28:12.920- 28:17.620* :  we'll save the day. Now what you need to know is that Chris is a musician and Moose the dog has
*28:17.620- 28:22.940* :  his own Facebook page, of course. So if you'd like to hear more of this, Moose the musical, if you
*28:22.940- 28:27.800* :  like, performed overlooking the Pacific Ocean, you know where to go. The happy part was mixed by
*28:27.800- 28:32.880* :  Pat Sessions. The producer was Anna Murphy. The editor was Karen Martin. My name's Andrew Peach.
*28:33.200- 28:33.740* :  Thanks for listening.
