01:52.280 - 01:56.280:  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Monday the 4th of September, these are our main stories.
01:56.780 - 02:01.360:  After months of fighting, Ukraine's generals say their troops have breached the first line of
02:01.360 - 02:07.540:  Russian defenses in the South near Zaparisha. More than 20 people have been killed in northeast
02:07.540 - 02:13.740:  Syria in clashes between government forces and Turkish-backed rebels. The Israeli government says
02:13.740 - 02:19.740:  it's considering deporting rival groups of Eritrean asylum seekers who were involved in clashes
02:19.740 - 02:31.480:  in Tel Aviv on Saturday. Also in this podcast. An event more used to dust storms has been transformed
02:31.480 - 02:36.500:  into a muddy quagmire. After what's fought to be the longest, heaviest rainfall,
02:36.500 - 02:42.260:  this festival has seen. Thousands of people trapped at the Burning Man festival in Nevada
02:42.780 - 02:46.120:  wait for good weather so that the exit roads can reopen.
02:49.240 - 02:54.360:  We begin in Ukraine where the country's generals are reporting significant progress in the
02:54.360 - 02:59.120:  counteroffensive against Russia's invasion. They say their troops have breached the first line
02:59.120 - 03:05.080:  of Russian defenses in the South near Zaparisha, allowing Ukrainian forces to operate between Moscow's
03:05.080 - 03:11.500:  first and second lines. General Alexander Taranowski, leading the southern counteroffensive,
03:11.940 - 03:15.480:  told a British newspaper that Kiev's army has made an important breakthrough.
03:16.040 - 03:20.560:  Ukraine says weeks of overnight work to clear landmines has led to the advance.
03:20.560 - 03:26.260:  Padio Connell put the report by the generals to Yuri Sak and adviser to the Ukrainian Minister of
03:26.260 - 03:32.660:  Defense. This is something which is the result of the smart military planning of our commanders.
03:33.440 - 03:39.340:  And General Taranowski, who you have just referred to, is a commander of the southern grouping
03:39.340 - 03:46.080:  of the Ukrainian armed forces. And they've been systematically progressing along the front lines.
03:46.080 - 03:52.440:  They have been systematically destroying the enemy's ammunition depots, enemy life force,
03:52.440 - 03:59.120:  enemy equipment. So like we said before, even at the time when there was a lot of skepticism
03:59.120 - 04:05.420:  about the pace of our offensive operations, we said that look, we asked for just two things,
04:05.420 - 04:11.980:  weapons and patience. I've heard you ask for them, but I'm needing to tell the list of what's
04:12.020 - 04:18.060:  new. Have you broken through the first line of Russian defense? And do you now operate between
04:18.060 - 04:23.740:  the first and second line? Yes, that has been confirmed. So you could say to your listeners that
04:23.740 - 04:29.400:  this is progress. I have also read of awful losses. You don't report the death toll.
04:29.740 - 04:36.680:  There is difficulty now in finding men to fight. Are you worried that your population is exhausted
04:36.680 - 04:42.940:  by war? Well, the reports we have seen some of them. They are not accurate. We have no idea what
04:43.200 - 04:48.520:  kind of data they're based on. Of course, this is a war. And of course, we do have losses on our
04:48.520 - 04:54.480:  side, but at the same time, even during the offensive operations, our losses are considerably
04:54.480 - 05:00.160:  smaller than those of the enemy. For example, during the last 24 hours, we have destroyed 600
05:00.220 - 05:05.160:  Russian soldiers and a lot of their equipment, 10 artillery systems and so on and so forth.
05:05.440 - 05:10.620:  So on a daily basis, we inflict more losses on the Russians than we suffer, and we have no
05:10.620 - 05:15.760:  problem with the reserves, with the morale of our troops, and we continue to move forward.
05:16.360 - 05:21.480:  That was Yuri Sakhan, advisor to the Ukrainian Minister of Defence. Well, for more details on what's
05:21.480 - 05:26.240:  going on, I spoke to our correspondent Paul Adams in Kiev. So this is an area, some distant
05:26.240 - 05:32.120:  south east of Zapparizha, right on the one of the sort of central areas of the front line that
05:32.120 - 05:38.960:  the Ukrainians have been probing and pushing and exploring for some time now. We heard a week or
05:38.960 - 05:44.020:  more ago about the fall of a tiny village of Robotiny with the Ukrainian flag being raised there.
05:44.180 - 05:50.420:  And since then, it seems that though Ukrainian forces have been trying to push forward in a
05:50.420 - 05:56.440:  couple of directions to try and find gaps in the Russian defenses. And we are being told,
05:56.440 - 06:01.120:  and we have no way of independently verifying this, but it's coming from a number of sources
06:01.600 - 06:06.500:  that they have indeed made that breakthrough. I think the thing to remember is it's a very small
06:06.500 - 06:11.820:  breakthrough on a very small part of a very large front line. What the Ukrainians will try and do
06:11.820 - 06:17.620:  now is to widen it in an effort to try and get it big enough so that they can push their armoured
06:17.620 - 06:22.680:  infantry through and properly exploit this breakthrough. But that could take some time still
06:22.680 - 06:27.040:  if it happens at all. Given though that they say there has been a breakthrough, albeit relatively
06:27.040 - 06:31.840:  small, it seems strange timing for many people that the Defence Minister, according to
06:31.840 - 06:35.980:  President Zelensky, they're getting asked parliament to dismiss him. What's going on there?
06:36.100 - 06:39.920:  It does seem like strange timing, doesn't it? And this is something that has in fact been coming
06:39.920 - 06:44.680:  for a little while, there's been quite a bit of chatter about this for some time. It is perhaps
06:44.680 - 06:50.760:  part of President Zelensky's wider anti-corruption drive, which has seen a number of high-profile cases
06:51.420 - 06:57.160:  throughout this year. There's no suggestion that Mr Resnikov himself is guilty of any corruption,
06:57.240 - 07:03.120:  but there is a feeling, in fact, there have been a number of quite well-publicised cases of corruption
07:03.120 - 07:08.740:  when it comes to procurement within his ministry. And that I think is why we're hearing President
07:08.740 - 07:13.520:  Zelensky saying the time has come to replace him. It is likely that Mr Resnikov will become the
07:13.520 - 07:20.080:  ambassador to the United Kingdom, and another politician will take his place as Defence Minister.
07:20.460 - 07:24.220:  Yes, it does seem strange. Mr Resnikov was a popular figure on the international scene,
07:24.220 - 07:29.920:  very much an ambassador for Ukraine, presence of all those meetings at which he lobbied hard for
07:29.920 - 07:35.480:  Ukraine to receive the kind of equipment that has gradually been handed over. But after a year
07:35.480 - 07:38.860:  and a half of war, Mr Zelensky has said the time has come to try some new blood.
07:39.420 - 07:45.720:  Paul Adams in Ukraine. Clashes involving Syrian government forces and Turkish-backed fighters
07:45.720 - 07:51.620:  in northeast Syria are reported to have left 23 people dead. The fighting happened when
07:51.620 - 07:58.720:  SNA fighters tried to move into the Kurdish-held area of Hasaka province. Mike Thompson has more
07:58.720 - 08:05.120:  details. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 18 of those who died belonged to a pro
08:05.120 - 08:11.140:  Ankara rebel group known as the Syrian National Army. The other five were reported to be opposing
08:11.140 - 08:17.940:  Syrian regime soldiers. The fighting happened when SNA fighters tried to move into the Kurdish-held
08:17.940 - 08:23.940:  area of Hasaka province near a strip of land by the Turkish border that's controlled by Ankara
08:23.940 - 08:30.320:  and its proxies. Mike Thompson. Next to Israel and the country's security minister said he plans to
08:30.320 - 08:36.120:  propose a bill that would permit the mass arrest and deportation of hundreds of Eritrean migrants.
08:36.140 - 08:41.220:  Itamar Ben-Govir's comments follow violent clashes on the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday
08:41.760 - 08:46.980:  between supporters and opponents of the Eritrean government. Around 160 people were injured
08:46.980 - 08:53.480:  as police used tear gas and live rounds to end the clashes. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
08:53.480 - 08:59.260:  had this to say. There remains this serious problem
08:59.260 - 09:04.460:  of the illegal infiltrators in southern Tel Aviv and what happened crossed a red line.
09:04.460 - 09:11.280:  This rioting, this bloodshed, this savageness we cannot accept. We are seeking strong steps against
09:11.280 - 09:17.280:  the rioters, including the immediate expulsion of those who took part. Our correspondent in Jerusalem
09:17.280 - 09:22.840:  Yalan Nel told me more about how what began as a story about conflict within the Eritrean community
09:22.840 - 09:28.360:  could become another battle between the Netanyahu government and those who oppose his reforms.
09:29.060 - 09:32.900:  What's interesting is it's come at a time when Israel is already split over the
09:33.380 - 09:37.980:  the government's highly controversial judicial overhaul plan and it is actually fed into that
09:37.980 - 09:42.020:  because you've had Mr Netanyahu and others in his cabinet blaming the Supreme Court
09:42.020 - 09:47.420:  for blocking early attempts of previous governments to try to push migrants out of Israel.
09:47.420 - 09:51.400:  Now it is very much something that the far right ministers, particularly the national
09:51.400 - 09:57.060:  security minister Itamar Ben-Govir, has campaigned about. He is now proposing a new basic law
09:57.060 - 10:02.820:  on migration, a new quasi-constitutional law and he wants it to use that to try to
10:02.820 - 10:07.120:  push ahead with the mass deportation of migrants. Israel is a signatory to the refugee
10:07.120 - 10:12.740:  convention so there would be legal issues there but do you think this kind of reaction would
10:12.740 - 10:17.240:  have been possible under any other government in Israel? What happened was something unprecedented
10:17.240 - 10:24.380:  in Tel Aviv, some 170 people injured including a number of police officers and has been widely
10:24.380 - 10:30.840:  condemned what happened across the political spectrum so I mean certainly it is a pet issue
10:30.840 - 10:35.120:  of some of the members of this cabinet so the response that we're seeing at the moment
10:35.160 - 10:39.540:  to a very hard line response probably we wouldn't have had them in quite the same way from other
10:39.540 - 10:45.180:  governments but I think we are also on course for another potential pointer of real tension
10:45.180 - 10:51.840:  between the government and the Supreme Court if the Supreme Court finds that efforts by Itamar Ben-Govir
10:51.840 - 10:57.960:  to deport people are against existing basic laws on human dignity and liberty for example
10:57.960 - 11:02.400:  that could be another real clash ahead. Leaving the legal matters aside for a second
11:02.820 - 11:07.620:  the Eritreans who are at risk of deportation and they say if they deported back to Eritrea they
11:07.620 - 11:13.400:  risk persecution they're reacting very strongly aren't they? Of course and it's estimated there
11:13.400 - 11:18.880:  about 20,000 asylum seekers from Eritrea in Israel most of them have been here for some years
11:18.880 - 11:24.900:  having arrived by crossing Egypt's Sinai Peninsula they say that they have escaped from one of the
11:24.900 - 11:30.940:  world's most repressive countries and I think you can see now within the community there is this
11:30.940 - 11:37.100:  sort of level of shock that has set in and there was one Eritrean who works in NGO which helps
11:37.100 - 11:46.400:  refugees in Israel, Kibrom Thwende and this is what he said. What happened left us shaken?
11:47.520 - 11:54.280:  We're ashamed about it but we're also hurting we're hurting and we're also afraid and we
11:54.280 - 12:00.420:  feel insecure in this country where further can we run to? We ran away from persecution in our
12:00.420 - 12:08.240:  country and the dictator regime continues to persecute us to silence us. Kibrom Thwende ending that
12:08.240 - 12:14.720:  interview with Yuland Nell Pope Francis has ended his first papal visit to Mongolia a country
12:14.720 - 12:20.960:  sandwich between Russia and China. He's long expressed his desire to visit China but the
12:20.960 - 12:26.940:  closest he might get there is Mongolia. At the end of the mass there flanked by leading Catholic
12:26.940 - 12:31.280:  clerics from Hong Kong. He had this message for China's 12 million Catholics.
12:35.440 - 12:41.060:  These two brother bishops, the Bishop Emeritus of Hong Kong and the current Bishop of Hong Kong.
12:41.100 - 12:47.700:  I would like to take advantage of their presence to send the warm greeting to the noble Chinese people,
12:47.700 - 12:54.600:  to all the people I wish the best and to go forward always moving forward. And I ask Chinese Catholics
12:54.600 - 13:01.560:  to be good Christians and good citizens. The Pope had arrived in Mongolia on Friday so what
13:01.560 - 13:06.940:  message was he tried to send to Chinese Catholics and the ruling Communist Party a question for our
13:06.940 - 13:12.460:  Asia-Pacific editor Michael Brister? Well when the Pope went to Mongolia many people questioned why
13:12.460 - 13:19.260:  after all Mongolia's got fewer than 1500 Catholics it was suggested that perhaps he was going there
13:19.800 - 13:25.460:  to deliver a message really his real audience perhaps was China which is next door to Mongolia.
13:25.900 - 13:31.540:  I think over the last couple of days what we've seen is that playing out on Saturday the Pope said
13:32.120 - 13:36.000:  didn't mention China directly but he said governments have nothing to fear from the Catholic
13:36.000 - 13:42.220:  Church it has no political agenda seem to be directed at Beijing and China and what he said
13:42.220 - 13:47.260:  directly today was about Chinese Catholics he was saying that they ought to be good Christians but
13:47.260 - 13:54.160:  also importantly good citizens essentially I think what he was saying to Beijing's look you've
13:54.160 - 13:59.160:  got nothing to fear from Christians they can still be loyal to the Communist Party they can
13:59.160 - 14:05.140:  still be good Chinese citizens as well as being Christians. And why do you think he needs to say
14:05.140 - 14:10.580:  this does it go back to a slightly fractious relationship between the Vatican and Beijing?
14:10.840 - 14:17.680:  Pope Francis has put great store by trying to improve relations with China and the Vatican and
14:17.680 - 14:23.640:  Beijing don't have diplomatic relations but the Pope sees that there were millions of Chinese
14:23.640 - 14:30.860:  Catholics perhaps 12 million and he wants to help them so five years ago he did a deal with Beijing
14:30.940 - 14:36.760:  so that they both agree on the appointment of bishops because what you have in China you've got
14:36.780 - 14:41.680:  two parallel churches really an underground church an unauthorized church backed by the Communist
14:41.680 - 14:46.440:  Party the Pope was trying to bring these together and he thought he could do that by
14:47.320 - 14:54.300:  agreeing with the Chinese Communist Party to jointly decide on bishops China as we neged on that
14:54.300 - 14:59.660:  a little bit appointed a couple of bishops without telling the Vatican the Vatican seems far more
14:59.660 - 15:04.920:  keen on this arrangement than the Chinese government. And there's never been any suggestion that
15:04.920 - 15:12.240:  there's any sedition amongst Catholics in China is there at all so is it just a matter of control
15:12.240 - 15:18.920:  letting Beijing see that it is in charge and in control? Basically yes Chinese leaders
15:18.920 - 15:25.140:  are obsessed with control what their citizens do and essentially what they don't want is Chinese
15:25.140 - 15:32.000:  Catholics to feel allegiance to a foreign religious leader based in Rome all the way over in
15:32.000 - 15:37.100:  Europe they want their allegiance to be to Xi Jinping Xi Jinping is more important than God
15:37.580 - 15:43.320:  in the eyes of the Chinese Communist Party and so they're suspicious of any organization like
15:43.320 - 15:49.000:  the Catholic Church which could influence people's behavior which could be an alternative source of
15:50.040 - 15:55.200:  Michael Brister tens of thousands of people trapped by unseasonal reign and mud at the

16:06.060 - 16:11.780:  ordered to shelter in place since Saturday after the weather turned the site at Black Rock into a

16:25.520 - 16:31.780:  quagmire after what's thought to be the longest heaviest rainfall this festival has seen since it
16:31.780 - 16:38.060:  was launched 37 years ago the day before people were due to start heading home the desert stand
16:38.060 - 16:43.960:  was transformed into thick clay leaving vehicles bogged down and festival goers
16:43.960 - 16:49.640:  scorching their way through ankle deep mud prompting the organizers to lock the gates to
16:49.640 - 16:56.260:  anyone seeking to enter or leave they'll remain closed until the ground hardens allowing the
16:56.260 - 17:02.280:  thousands of vehicles stuck here to leave through narrow desert roads without getting bogged down

17:08.880 - 17:15.220:  because you don't know how long you'll be stuck here the mood remains generally upbeat but the

19:34.500 - 19:39.860:  welcome back to the global news podcast for the first time Mexico could have two women facing
19:39.860 - 19:45.100:  each other in the presidential elections next year the opposition coalition has formally announced
19:45.100 - 19:51.320:  Sotil Galvez a politician with indigenous roots who escape rural poverty to be their
19:51.320 - 19:57.360:  presidential candidate in next year's polls i heard more from oscar Lopez a journalist who
19:57.360 - 20:04.200:  covers Mexico for the Washington Post. Sotil Galvez is from the state of i dalgo she grew up in a small
20:04.200 - 20:09.980:  indigenous community father was an alcoholic quite abusive as she tells it and she kind of
20:10.040 - 20:15.200:  has a bit of a rags to riches story where she ended up going to the national university
20:15.200 - 20:21.000:  studying engineering and founding two quite successful tech companies before going to politics.
20:21.240 - 20:25.740:  said very interesting she came from a very humble and difficult background and made it
20:25.740 - 20:32.820:  quite big she's from the more conservative pan national action party what kind of a candidate
20:32.820 - 20:38.540:  will she be? well she's an interesting case because although as you say she does represent the
20:38.540 - 20:44.180:  conservative P.A.N party in parliament she's actually more progressive herself and she's
20:44.400 - 20:52.420:  said many times that she's not militant for the P.A.N and while the P.A.N is largely anti-abortion
20:52.420 - 20:59.840:  anti-LGBT rights Sotil herself is more progressive on those issues so i think she's trying to build
20:59.840 - 21:04.500:  more of a coalition you know she's she's the the representative of a kind of fractious
21:04.500 - 21:09.900:  opposition coalition of three main parties coming together kind of an opposition to the president
21:09.900 - 21:15.500:  his movement and so i think she's trying to build kind of a big tent moment trying to bring in both
21:15.500 - 21:20.120:  the conservative base but also more progressives and also people who are just dissatisfied with the
21:20.120 - 21:25.220:  current state of the country and her likely opponent main opponent is going to be Claudia Scheinbaum
21:25.480 - 21:32.240:  from the current president's party. it pulls for the governing party that's more in that show
21:32.240 - 21:37.760:  that Claudia Scheinbaum is the most likely person to succeed and that is Manuel Lopez Oblador who's
21:37.760 - 21:42.540:  the current president and can't run for re-election she's sort of seen as someone who's been
21:43.000 - 21:47.720:  sort of hand picked by the president to carry on his legacy and carry on his movement she's seen
21:47.720 - 21:53.640:  as someone very close to the president someone who can champion his ideals his vision but she
21:53.640 - 21:57.840:  differs from the president in some significant ways particularly as someone who has a climate
21:57.840 - 22:02.580:  change scientist and seen as someone who could potentially be more environmentally friendly.
22:02.800 - 22:08.260:  now how significant is it for mexican politics and mexican society that both leading candidates
22:08.260 - 22:13.800:  will be women for the first time i think it's historic undeniably i mean mexican goes a country
22:13.800 - 22:19.280:  where you still see a lot of machismo very conservative it has very high rates of violence against
22:19.280 - 22:25.880:  women and historically you know women haven't had a significant place in politics that's changed
22:25.880 - 22:30.660:  in recent years as laws were passed to require political parties to have a certain number of women
22:31.320 - 22:35.000:  representing them in congress and actually mexican now has one of the most gender balanced
22:35.000 - 22:40.760:  congresses in the world but to have a woman running on for both parties as the leading presidential
22:40.760 - 22:45.260:  contenders is hugely significant because it means that no matter who wins mexican will have a
22:45.260 - 22:51.740:  women president for the first time. Oscar Lopez from the Washington Post in august we reported
22:51.740 - 22:58.460:  on a wooden fishing boat that had been found adrift off the canary islands with 38 people on board
22:58.460 - 23:04.540:  it had set out from Senegal more than a month earlier carrying 101 people.
23:05.320 - 23:10.400:  well the BBC's Joel Gunter now tells the grim story of a tragedy and one of the most dangerous
23:10.400 - 23:12.100:  migration routes in the world.
23:18.800 - 23:23.320:  Adema is sitting indoors with his mother and close family as they share a plate of food
23:23.320 - 23:29.280:  he eats slowly and carefully his eyes are downcast and his thoughts seem far away.
23:29.280 - 23:33.860:  This 21-year-old fisherman has just returned from an unimaginable ordeal.
23:34.260 - 23:39.520:  In July he set out with 101 others from this village in a wooden boat called a parogue
23:40.100 - 23:45.660:  aiming for the canary islands. The boat became hopelessly lost and drifted for more than a month.
23:46.420 - 23:54.300:  We were so tired. We were starving and thirsty and the sun was beating down on us.
23:55.040 - 24:00.700:  You cannot do anything only like silently staring at the people who still have some food.
24:04.720 - 24:09.880:  After a week at sea passengers on the parogue began to pass away from first and hunger.
24:10.380 - 24:16.080:  63 would die under the baking sun including Adam's brother and his two cousins.
24:18.680 - 24:24.780:  Every time somebody died I thought I would be next. At first we said a prayer for each
24:24.780 - 24:30.900:  dead person and put their body into the ocean. Later we just threw the bodies into the water
24:31.020 - 24:36.240:  because we didn't even have the energy to pray. We just needed to get rid of the corpses.
24:36.240 - 24:44.680:  Back in the village after a week with no news, relatives of the migrants began to panic.
24:45.620 - 24:48.340:  Adam's mother Soknafeid something was terribly wrong.
24:54.260 - 24:57.240:  The whole village was worried wondering if our family members were lost.
24:57.940 - 25:02.460:  Everybody was becoming stressed. I got sick because of the situation and couldn't eat.
25:03.180 - 25:05.240:  I don't want to go to school.
25:06.060 - 25:10.080:  In another house nearby other members of the family are joining to pray.
25:11.100 - 25:13.440:  They are in mourning for the three boys who died.
25:13.980 - 25:17.400:  Our brother Adam's cousin did not make it home.
25:21.140 - 25:24.580:  When we learned that the boat had been found I thought my brother was coming home
25:25.460 - 25:28.380:  but then they said he was among those who had died in the water.
25:29.400 - 25:33.180:  My brother always taught me that if I study hard I will become successful.
25:34.180 - 25:38.300:  When I got married the first thing he asked me was are you going to finish your studies?
25:39.200 - 25:44.080:  I miss him so much. Migration experts say that the people leaving these shores
25:44.700 - 25:47.260:  are setting out on one of the most dangerous routes in the world.
25:48.100 - 25:52.440:  People here in Fast Boy will tell you that two of every three boats that leaves
25:52.440 - 25:58.140:  is never heard from again. And yet it is clear that even a tragedy as brave
25:58.140 - 26:02.040:  as this one is not going to stop others from taking the same risk.
26:07.780 - 26:11.660:  All along the beach here fishermen are taking out their wooden boats and bringing home
26:11.660 - 26:17.600:  what little catch they have been able to find. They say that industrial overfishing is
26:17.600 - 26:24.640:  robbing them of their livelihood. In the shade by boat I find Assam, a young fishing captain
26:24.760 - 26:29.360:  and his crew knitting generator covers they can sell to help make ends meet.
26:32.460 - 26:36.780:  I'm thinking about leaving right now it is all I'm thinking about
26:37.940 - 26:42.780:  and this tragedy will not stop people here from going. We are trying to find solutions to support
26:46.600 - 26:50.360:  our families. Almost everyone in Fast Boy is connected to someone who went on this boat.
26:51.560 - 26:56.400:  Back at Adam's home his mother tells me that the grief here is turning to anger.
26:59.900 - 27:04.360:  All of our hopes have drowned. The people on the boats are the future of Fast Boye,
27:04.760 - 27:08.920:  they are the hopes of the country, the youth are the seeds of our future but they are dying.
27:11.120 - 27:14.400:  Senegal she says is being robbed of its future.
27:17.140 - 27:22.940:  That report was by Joel Gunter in Senegal. You are listening to the Global News podcast.
27:24.440 - 27:29.080:  A global search has begun for the base guitar that the English singer and musician
27:29.080 - 27:33.740:  support McCartney played in his first public performances with the Beatles.
27:33.740 - 27:41.620:  He bought the instrument in Hamburg in Germany in 1961 for just $37 or 30 pounds but later
27:41.620 - 27:44.520:  disappeared. Kate Ferrand takes up the story.
27:47.900 - 27:52.320:  Love Me Do, an early track which support recorded with his first Hoffner guitar.
27:53.100 - 27:57.820:  He bought the violin-shaped bass when he was 19 from a shop in Hamburg in 1961.
27:58.600 - 28:02.600:  Not yet, the focus is screaming fans. It cost just 30 pounds.
28:02.620 - 28:09.240:  He replaced the instrument two years later but in 1969 it disappeared, seemingly stolen from
28:09.240 - 28:15.320:  a storage space. Rumors swirled for years as to its whereabouts but responding to a personal
28:15.320 - 28:20.320:  appeal by the Beatles singer is long-standing supplier and advisor at Hoffner has now launched
28:20.320 - 28:26.160:  a full global hunt for the base. The guitar expert says the £10 million instrument has an
28:26.160 - 28:36.100:  importance beyond support and Beatles fans. Kate Ferrand. A woman from Tennessee in the US officially
28:36.100 - 28:42.360:  has the longest female mullet in the world and it's not the mullet fish we're talking about.
28:42.360 - 28:48.780:  Tammy Manis, who's 58, is a nurse with an extreme hairstyle short at the side and front
28:48.780 - 28:56.340:  and 172 centimeters at the back. She'll be featured in next year's Guinness Book of World Records.
28:56.500 - 29:01.280:  She's been telling Paul Henley about it, starting with her definition of a mullet.
29:01.980 - 29:05.480:  Well, I've actually went down the rabbit hole and looked and there were like 19 different
29:05.480 - 29:12.420:  types. Generally most people think of a mullet as short on the side, short on top, long in the back.
29:12.820 - 29:17.120:  Yours is very long on the back. Five feet eight inches, it's taller than you, I'm assuming.
29:17.120 - 29:22.540:  Yeah, it is. I had to wet it, stretch it out and have it measured and validated.
29:23.440 - 29:26.580:  Sounds sort of inconvenient in daily life terms.
29:27.980 - 29:32.380:  I actually keep it braided during my work week, so it stays braided, so it only comes down to
29:32.380 - 29:37.380:  like just right around my ankles. You're a nurse, aren't you? Yes. Does it get in the way
29:37.640 - 29:42.660:  when you work in hospital? I work in a health department, so I'm not in a hospital setting,
29:42.660 - 29:48.140:  but it's actually not that difficult because since I keep it braided and I've had it for so many years,
29:48.140 - 29:52.680:  I know exactly where it's at and usually I wear a little support belt just because moving around,
29:52.680 - 29:57.360:  you know, you don't want to hurt your back and it kind of keeps it tame and when I sit down,
29:57.360 - 30:02.020:  I just kind of pull it to the front, so it's never really in my way. What first inspired you to
30:02.020 - 30:06.760:  grow your hair this way? That's the question everyone asked. It was the late 80s. Tilted you stay
30:06.760 - 30:10.980:  head of song that came out, voice is carried and I love that song and I looked at it and went,
30:10.980 - 30:15.340:  I want one of them, their retails. You had a sort of false start, didn't you? I had kind of a
30:15.340 - 30:21.460:  false start. Well, I had that for a few years and then I cut it off. November of 89, I still have
30:21.460 - 30:27.960:  the original little retail. Immediately regretted that. So February the 9th, 1990, I went and
30:27.960 - 30:32.600:  I had shoulder length hair at the time and cut it and said, leave the tail and started growing it.
30:32.920 - 30:39.220:  And what kind of reaction do you get daily? Usually as wow, that is some long hair and then it's,
30:39.260 - 30:46.380:  is that all yours? Yes. Do you braid that yourself? No. I have a friend that braids it once a week,
30:46.700 - 30:50.620:  you know, the usual stuff. How long have you had it? How long does it take to braid it? How do you
30:50.620 - 30:55.100:  take care of it? Presumably, it's not obvious that you've got a mullet from the front.
30:55.100 - 30:59.640:  It's really funny because people don't notice it till I turn around to like walk up to the room,
30:59.640 - 31:05.120:  they're like, oh my god, that's your yell. It's a conversation piece. It's really good. It puts
31:05.120 - 31:09.980:  patience at ease. It gives them something to talk about, distracts them if I'm drawing blood.
31:11.080 - 31:13.680:  Tammy Mannis with her record breaking hairstyle.
31:16.680 - 31:20.940:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
