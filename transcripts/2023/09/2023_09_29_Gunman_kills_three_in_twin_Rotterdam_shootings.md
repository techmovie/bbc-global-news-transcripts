*01:07.960- 01:12.580* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Friday, the 29th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:13.060- 01:18.120* :  Three people, including a 14-year-old girl, have been shot and killed by a gunman in the Dutch
*01:18.120- 01:23.780* :  city of Rotterdam. Republicans in the United States are holding their first hearing into whether
*01:23.780- 01:29.400* :  to impeach Joe Biden, despite failing to show any evidence of wrongdoing by the president.
*01:30.100- 01:34.800* :  Separatist leaders in the Gunnar Karabakh say they are officially ending independent
*01:34.800- 01:39.900* :  efforts as people continue to flee after Azerbaijan sees control of the territory.
*01:42.080- 01:47.080* :  Also in this podcast. Oh, do it for goodness sake. Just a special place. I propose my wife here.
*01:47.080- 01:52.720* :  Absolutely devastating. I mean, it's heartbreaking. Shock in the community has one of Britain's
*01:52.720- 01:58.040* :  most famous trees that even appeared in a Hollywood movie is felled in the darkness of night.
*02:01.380- 02:07.500* :  We begin in the Netherlands. Police say a gunman has killed three people, including a 14-year-old girl
*02:07.500- 02:12.920* :  in the city of Rotterdam then. He first opened fire at a house before traveling to a nearby
*02:12.920- 02:18.160* :  university medical center. One hospital worker described the moment they realized the building was
*02:18.160- 02:25.780* :  under attack. We heard that the shooter was roaming through the hospital, so we suddenly had to
*02:25.780- 02:31.560* :  go outside. It's quite bizarre. We practice this regularly and it's always kind of funny.
*02:32.260- 02:38.180* :  Now we're suddenly living it for real. Fire's broke out at both locations. Police have arrested a
*02:38.180- 02:42.400* :  32-year-old man. I heard more from our correspondent in the Netherlands and a Hollywood,
*02:42.400- 02:48.080* :  who was outside the Erasmus University Medical Center. An absolutely terrifying day for
*02:48.080- 02:53.860* :  Rotterdam student community, especially given that what we now know from the Justice Department
*02:53.860- 03:02.240* :  confirmation, the main suspect, the gunman, is a student. He has been named as Fouad El, a 32-year-old
*03:02.240- 03:10.180* :  student from Rotterdam. He is suspected of earlier today starting off at an apartment about
*03:10.500- 03:15.680* :  two kilometres from where I am now outside the Erasmus Medical Center. There there was a shooting
*03:15.680- 03:22.840* :  a 39-year-old woman and her 14-year-old daughter were killed. He then set fire to that apartment
*03:22.840- 03:29.320* :  and travelled here to the Erasmus Medical Center. And he stormed the building. So we've seen
*03:29.320- 03:35.560* :  images of doctors coming out, pushing patients on stretchers. The whole building was evacuated.
*03:35.940- 03:40.300* :  Some people were stuck in rooms and they were taping notes to the window with a note of their
*03:40.300- 03:47.100* :  room number asking for help. No one knew how many gunmen there were. If the gunman was still inside,
*03:47.900- 03:52.880* :  it seems as though he managed to walk through the building. Students have talked about him throwing
*03:52.880- 03:58.740* :  Molotov cocktails. We've seen pictures of fire and at the end of this siege, this rampage through
*03:58.740- 04:03.880* :  the hospital. He was eventually arrested underneath the helipad and some pictures have been shared
*04:03.880- 04:10.580* :  on Dutch news websites of manning camouflage combat star trousers in handcuffs being detained by police.
*04:11.520- 04:16.740* :  And the fact that witnesses describe seeing, as you say, a man dressed in combat gear wearing a
*04:16.740- 04:21.860* :  bulletproof vest does suggest a fairly high degree of preparation for this and might have had an
*04:21.860- 04:27.220* :  impact on how long lasting this rampage was. Precisely, he clearly had come prepared.
*04:27.220- 04:32.920* :  Speaking to people around here, when I arrived, I spoke to a student. He said everyone was stunned.
*04:33.100- 04:37.680* :  Everyone had heard the sirens. All of the WhatsApp groups were being filled with messages,
*04:37.680- 04:43.520* :  photographs, people asking questions, checking everyone else was all right. The chair of the
*04:43.520- 04:48.040* :  Erasmus Medical Center has said the killings left a scar on the entire student community.
*04:48.040- 04:53.980* :  So it does seem as though he was prepared and there was speculation initially that there may
*04:53.980- 04:59.200* :  have been a terror motive. But what we do know from police is that this man, this 32-year-old
*04:59.200- 05:03.780* :  suspect from Rosadam, was known to them. He had a conviction a couple of years ago for animal
*05:03.780- 05:10.180* :  cruelty. He did some community service for that and there are also reports that the killings may
*05:10.180- 05:15.880* :  have been more personal vendetta as the most suggestion of any kind of terror or political motives
*05:15.880- 05:20.940* :  in anything that I've seen from the authorities so far. Anahologin in the Netherlands.
*05:22.140- 05:26.800* :  In Sweden, the Prime Minister has said the country is going through a wave of gang-related
*05:26.800- 05:32.780* :  violence like nothing in its history. Ulf Christensen was speaking after three people were killed in
*05:32.780- 05:38.360* :  separate incidents over Wednesday night, raising the total to 11 dead in September alone.
*05:39.040- 05:43.120* :  Mr. Christensen pledged to help those who were too scared to go to the police.
*05:47.180- 05:52.160* :  All of you should know that we're on the same side. We must hunt the gangs. We must defeat the
*05:52.160- 05:57.380* :  gangs. They must be locked up for very long prison terms. And if you are a foreign citizen,
*05:57.380- 06:03.240* :  you must be deported. Serious organized crime and deadly gun violence have increased sharply.
*06:03.240- 06:08.260* :  They recruit children and train the killers of the future. The Prime Minister of Sweden.
*06:09.260- 06:13.640* :  In the United States, legal experts have told Congress it is premature to impeach
*06:13.640- 06:19.600* :  President Biden, although most believe his son hunters' activities justify further investigation.
*06:20.100- 06:25.240* :  They were addressing hearings on Thursday that are part of a Republican bid to impeach Mr. Biden.
*06:25.260- 06:31.000* :  The party accuses him of profiting from his son's business ventures while serving as vice
*06:31.000- 06:36.400* :  president. The Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, James Coma, suggests there is
*06:36.400- 06:41.620* :  a mountain of evidence already to support their inquiry. For years, President Biden has lied
*06:41.620- 06:47.860* :  to the American people about his knowledge of and participation in his family's corrupt
*06:47.860- 06:53.800* :  business schemes. At least ten times, Joe Biden lied to the American people that he never
*06:53.800- 06:58.600* :  spoke to his family about their business dealings. He lied about telling the American people that
*06:58.600- 07:04.380* :  there was an absolute wall between his official government, duties and his personal life. Let's
*07:04.380- 07:11.140* :  be clear, there was no wall. Democrats say this is an impeachment inquiry in search of the evidence,
*07:11.140- 07:15.660* :  a stunt designed to distract from the many indictments that Donald Trump is facing.
*07:16.220- 07:18.720* :  Here's Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin.
*07:19.460- 07:23.620* :  We've held hearings and conducted interviews with everybody from a hundred Biden's business
*07:23.620- 07:29.520* :  partners to a federal agent assigned to that investigation. And still, we found no evidence
*07:29.520- 07:35.880* :  of wrongdoing by President Biden. If the Republicans had a smoking gun, we're even a dripping water
*07:36.380- 07:41.920* :  pistol. They would be presenting it today, but they've got nothing on Joe Biden.
*07:41.920- 07:46.520* :  I spoke to our Washington correspondent, Gary O'Donohue, and asked him for more about the case
*07:46.520- 07:52.020* :  that the Republicans will try to make. They'll try, I think, and they'll have to do this, not just by
*07:52.020- 07:58.020* :  sort of saying it, but issuing subpoenas, et cetera, to build some proof or some way to evidence
*07:58.060- 08:04.520* :  that links Hunter Biden's business activities to his father. And they say that the family is
*08:04.520- 08:09.660* :  profited hugely, but they've really struggled up till now to prove that Joe Biden made any money
*08:09.660- 08:14.580* :  effectively. And that's what they would really have to prove. Lying actually isn't going to
*08:14.580- 08:19.180* :  wouldn't be enough to get to the sort of level of an impeachment, even if Joe Biden hasn't been
*08:19.180- 08:23.880* :  accurate about what he said, although you don't want your president's lying. So it's a big ask
*08:23.880- 08:28.440* :  for the Republicans. And for months, they've been looking for this stuff, and they haven't produced
*08:28.440- 08:32.060* :  it so far, but they'll hope, I think, in the coming weeks to get more.
*08:32.640- 08:36.620* :  You intimated there, Gary, that this would be the first stage of a very long process
*08:37.160- 08:40.420* :  to any full impeachment, wouldn't it? Yeah, it would. And not least because
*08:41.140- 08:45.920* :  the Republicans are far from clear, those who are running the inquiry, that they could get
*08:45.920- 08:50.520* :  the House of Representatives to impeach the president, even though they have a majority.
*08:51.120- 08:54.680* :  Their majority is very slim, and there are a bunch of Republicans who think this impeachment
*08:54.680- 09:00.820* :  inquiry is a bad idea. That's why there hasn't been a vote on the floor to start the inquiry,
*09:00.820- 09:05.980* :  to authorize the inquiry. It's simply been done by edict from the Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
*09:06.400- 09:11.080* :  And so they have their own internal problems over this process. Now, the weather could change,
*09:11.080- 09:16.780* :  if they suddenly turn up some decent evidence, but as things stand, it's not really the Democrats,
*09:16.780- 09:21.780* :  they have to worry about it's some of their own people. And Gary, it's hard to assess this,
*09:21.800- 09:27.020* :  but to what extent do you think it's going to have any kind of political effect in the run-up
*09:27.020- 09:32.000* :  to the elections? It could turn off a lot of voters of time of impeachments.
*09:32.320- 09:37.180* :  Yes, it could. I mean, it could backfire on Republicans, in particular, if it's seen as frivolous,
*09:37.540- 09:41.380* :  if it's seen as sort of, particularly at the moment where we've got to the alluming shutdown
*09:41.420- 09:47.180* :  of the government coming, potential for millions of federal workers not getting paid. This could
*09:47.180- 09:53.180* :  seem something that's not in touch with real people's needs and their interest. That's potentially
*09:53.260- 09:59.320* :  true. There's political capital in kicking up enough sand to create an impression, if you like,
*09:59.320- 10:04.280* :  of wrongdoing. Even if they don't have evidence, that makes political sense. The difficulty,
*10:04.280- 10:10.040* :  I think, for them was that sustaining that while at the same time trying to explain a way, the
*10:10.040- 10:15.760* :  difficulties that Donald Trump has legally is a tricky one. In some ways, this just draws more
*10:15.760- 10:22.620* :  attention to what he's doing. Gary O'Donohue in Washington. A severe drought in Brazil's
*10:22.620- 10:28.260* :  Amazon region has prompted the authorities in the city of Manaus to declare a 90-day state
*10:28.260- 10:32.780* :  of emergency. Manaus is the biggest city in the Amazon. Leonardo Rosha reports.
*10:33.740- 10:38.940* :  The local mayor Davi Silva said the level of the river that crosses the city, the Rio Negro,
*10:38.940- 10:46.180* :  has been dropping by 30 centimeters a day. It's now close to a record low. What the supplies in Manaus
*10:46.180- 10:52.200* :  and other cities could be affected? Many tributaries of the Rio Negro, which are used as access routes
*10:52.200- 10:58.120* :  through the tropical jungle, have dried up for the first time in years. The rainy season is due
*10:58.120- 11:03.780* :  to start in November. The authorities in Brazil attribute this year's serious drought in the Amazon
*11:03.780- 11:11.360* :  region to eline weather phenomenon and climate change. Leonardo Rosha. It is over. That is, in effect,
*11:11.360- 11:16.420* :  what the separatist leader of Nagorno Karabakh has said about a hundred-year long struggle for
*11:16.420- 11:22.300* :  independence. Samval Shakramanyan issued a decree saying that at the end of the year, the Republic
*11:22.300- 11:28.300* :  of Nagorno Karabakh would cease to exist. It came just a week after Azerbaijanis forces captured
*11:28.300- 11:33.200* :  the area. Half the population has now fled into neighboring Armenia, where the Prime Minister,
*11:33.200- 11:42.240* :  Nikol Pashinyan, accused Baku of ethnic cleansing. The exodus of Armenians from Nagorno Karabakh
*11:42.380- 11:49.300* :  as a result of Azerbaijan's ethnic cleansing policy continued. Analysis of the situation show that
*11:49.300- 11:55.440* :  in the coming days, there will be no Armenians left in the Nagorno Karabakh. This is an act of ethnic
*11:55.440- 12:01.920* :  cleansing. A correspondent in the Caucasus Rehendomitri gave me her assessment of why people in Nagorno
*12:01.920- 12:09.240* :  Karabakh have been leaving. There has been so much violence between these two communities and I'm
*12:09.240- 12:15.700* :  talking about really, really horrible stuff, you know, beheadings, mutilations. So this is so
*12:15.700- 12:23.720* :  much hatred that it's unimaginable for Armenians to stay in that land and to accept Azerbaijanian
*12:23.720- 12:30.120* :  rule. They are terrified and I think that's the main reason why they're leaving. And also,
*12:30.120- 12:35.660* :  if you want a bit more kind of pictures, you know, to add to it. Now on social media, we're seeing
*12:35.660- 12:41.960* :  all sorts of videos appearing, which shows Azerbaijanian forces kind of looting the homes of ethnic
*12:41.960- 12:49.180* :  Armenians or somehow like expressing their frustration by throwing things around by breaking
*12:49.180- 12:55.140* :  photographs, breaking furniture. And Armenians are watching this and they know that can you imagine
*12:55.600- 12:59.360* :  what would have happened to them if they still remained in their own homes?
*12:59.980- 13:05.180* :  We heard there from the Prime Minister of Armenia that he doesn't anticipate there being
*13:05.180- 13:09.000* :  many ethnic Armenians left in Nagorno Karabakh.
*13:09.740- 13:15.340* :  Well, the latest figure is that we have from the Armenian government is more than 70,000 people
*13:15.380- 13:21.060* :  that have left their homes in Nagorno Karabakh already since the Exodus began on Sunday.
*13:21.840- 13:27.180* :  We know that the official figures about the number of people living in Nagorno Karabakh
*13:27.520- 13:34.400* :  from the Armenian authorities has been 120,000 people. So what is going to happen to the remaining
*13:34.400- 13:42.240* :  50,000 people as we understand the majority of those people are people who worked in the de facto
*13:42.240- 13:47.580* :  state structures, people who were the fighters, former government officials. And of course,
*13:47.580- 13:50.480* :  the big question is what's going to happen to these people?
*13:50.840- 13:54.780* :  Now, the admission by the separatist leader of Nagorno Karabakh that the struggle for
*13:54.780- 14:01.080* :  independence is effectively over. That is huge news for ethnic Armenians, but also for Azerbaijanis.
*14:01.200- 14:07.500* :  It's a huge moment. I've seen a footage of an Armenian news reader announcing this news
*14:07.760- 14:14.780* :  and she was crying. I mean, right now, everybody's in the state of panic because things have
*14:15.480- 14:20.940* :  been happening so fast. It's a big, big tragic event for ethnic Armenians.
*14:21.180- 14:24.980* :  And a significant moment for people in Azerbaijan as well, because they would say this is a
*14:25.180- 14:28.360* :  vindication of what we've been trying to do, recover our territory.
*14:28.620- 14:34.280* :  Of course, it's a matter for celebration because Azerbaijan has been in a state of war with
*14:34.280- 14:41.440* :  Armenia for so long over this territory. You know, so many thousands people, soldiers have been
*14:41.440- 14:47.400* :  killed on both sides in Azerbaijan as well. So finally, they have this territory back.
*14:48.080- 14:52.840* :  Rehandometri. Elchin Amir Beyov is an advisor to the president of Azerbaijan.
*14:52.940- 14:58.880* :  James Menendez asked him to respond to those accusations of ethnic cleansing. Is that what is
*14:58.880- 15:04.400* :  taking place in Nagorno Karabakh? Of course not. And we strongly condemn and reject the statement
*15:04.400- 15:09.080* :  by Prime Minister Pashinyan. But you wouldn't deny that the effect of the operation, the military
*15:09.080- 15:15.560* :  operation last week is that that it has emptied out Nagorno Karabakh of ethnic Armenians or
*15:15.560- 15:19.540* :  the least at the moment, half of those who were living there. Well, let me tell you that in
*15:19.540- 15:26.020* :  this regard, the current departure of Armenian residents is their personal, voluntary and
*15:26.020- 15:31.220* :  individual decision. Well, it has nothing to do with the forced relocation or with the desire
*15:31.220- 15:35.780* :  of Azerbaijan for them to leave. No, no, but I wasn't saying I was just saying that the impact
*15:35.780- 15:41.640* :  of what has happened in the last few days is that the ethnic Armenians feel they're not safe
*15:41.640- 15:47.540* :  or not welcome in Azerbaijan now that the military operation is complete and they feel they have
*15:47.540- 15:52.280* :  no choice but to leave. Well, I think that they do have choice. And that's what I was trying to say
*15:52.280- 15:56.960* :  because if you look at what Azerbaijan authorities have been doing in the last four or five days,
*15:57.380- 16:04.020* :  we have already established electricity 24 hours a day tomorrow in a couple of gas will be delivered.
*16:04.900- 16:10.240* :  It's true that while we do all those steps, it's very hard for us to prevent them from leaving
*16:10.740- 16:16.700* :  because if we would try to do that, we would be accused of holding them sort of hostage.
*16:17.680- 16:20.800* :  Elchen Amerbeov, advisor to the president of Azerbaijan.
*16:22.460- 16:27.340* :  In Germany, a campaign is underway to change a law that sees thousands of people
*16:27.340- 16:31.680* :  sent to prison every year for traveling on public transport without a ticket.
*16:32.520- 16:38.160* :  It's a law that dates from when the Nazis came to power in the early 1930s. The man behind
*16:38.160- 16:43.660* :  the campaign has come up with an ingenious way to attract public attention as Tim Mansell reports.
*16:47.760- 16:59.100* :  And so I got to get a ticket both for me and for my bike. So it's 320. And then for my bike,
*16:59.180- 17:02.760* :  it's another 220. So that's 540.
*17:04.740- 17:09.900* :  Anna Zensrota, journalist and activist, usually cycles around Berlin. But today,
*17:10.360- 17:11.640* :  he's agreed to take the train.
*17:13.660- 17:18.440* :  Anna is the founder of the Freedom Fund, an eye catching initiative that helps people
*17:18.440- 17:24.160* :  sent to jail for not buying a train ticket. We actually pay the fines for people who are in
*17:24.160- 17:30.500* :  prison. And in that moment, when we pay it, people can actually walk free. This began at the end
*17:30.500- 17:37.280* :  of 2021. Anna arrived at one of Berlin's prisons with 20,000 euros in cash in his pocket.
*17:37.340- 17:44.780* :  12 people walked free that day. Since then, he's received donations of around 800,000 euros
*17:44.780- 17:52.940* :  and paid for more than 850 people to get out of jail. We believe that the law that criminalises
*17:52.940- 18:00.560* :  people for riding without a ticket is deeply unjust. And it discriminates heavily against
*18:00.560- 18:06.400* :  people who don't have money, against people who don't have housing, against people who are
*18:06.400- 18:13.560* :  already in their crisis. It's estimated that 7,000 people are in prison in Germany for not paying
*18:17.800- 18:22.940* :  a fair. These are melts, a recovering heroin addict, served a four-month sentence after being
*18:22.940- 18:31.840* :  caught twice without a ticket. I was on methadone, the drug they give you instead of heroin.
*18:32.480- 18:37.760* :  And you have to go to the clinic every day to take it. I didn't have a ticket, but I had to get
*18:37.760- 18:45.180* :  there before I started to get withdrawal symptoms. It was just four stops. And for four stops,
*18:45.180- 18:49.860* :  you have to pay three euros and 10 cents. It was the end of the month and I didn't have any money left.
*18:50.440- 18:55.580* :  Most people who end up in prison for fair dodging do so because they failed to pay the fine
*18:55.580- 19:02.520* :  imposed by the court. Some, like Giza, are sent straight to prison. In these cases, the freedom
*19:02.520- 19:11.240* :  fund can't help. If you're caught without a ticket on most German transport systems,
*19:11.240- 19:18.340* :  you'll be asked to pay an immediate 60 euro penalty fare. It's usually serial offenders who were
*19:18.340- 19:25.560* :  then referred for prosecution. Lars Wagner of VDV, an organisation representing hundreds of
*19:25.560- 19:32.200* :  German public transport companies, says they lose 300 million euros a year to fare dodges.
*19:32.820- 19:40.460* :  The 60 Euros seems not to be enough, so we have to do more to get these people scared of being caught
*19:40.460- 19:47.280* :  again. Do you think if people were no longer prosecuted, it would lead to an epidemic of people
*19:47.280- 19:54.660* :  traveling without a ticket? I don't know. But your organisation is clear that the existence of
*19:54.660- 20:04.260* :  this law is an effective deterrent. Yes, for sure. Arnazemzrat says the irony of his campaign is that
*20:04.260- 20:10.220* :  the people who ask most frequently for financial help are the prisons themselves. The freedom
*20:10.220- 20:15.680* :  fund application form is often given to prisoners as they arrive to start their sentence.
*20:16.480- 20:24.180* :  On one point, the state criminalises people and then on the other side, the same state comes to a
*20:24.180- 20:31.460* :  civil society organisation and is asking them for help to correct this, which really shows you the
*20:31.460- 20:39.040* :  absurdity of it all. Arnazemzrat, ending that report from Tim Manson. Still to come.
*20:42.980- 20:46.880* :  I've actually never talked about this in any other interview. This is the first time I'm
*20:46.880- 20:53.320* :  talking about this. The Japanese British singer, Ad actress, Rina Sawayama reveals the inspiration behind

*22:33.880- 22:38.100* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The island of Corsica sits in the Mediterranean,
*22:38.100- 22:43.760* :  it is close to Italy, but actually part of France, this despite the efforts of Corsica nationalists
*22:43.760- 22:47.860* :  who want independence. When it seems the French president and manoeuvre Macron,
*22:47.860- 22:53.100* :  may be about to deliver some of what they want. I spoke to our Europe Regional Editor
*22:53.100- 22:56.480* :  Paul Moss and asked him for more on the background of Corsica.
*22:57.260- 23:02.060* :  Back in the mid 18th century, France and the Kingdom of Genoa and what is now Italy were
*23:02.060- 23:07.080* :  fighting over this island, and people they got tired of basically being a pawn in other people's
*23:07.080- 23:13.020* :  games and set up their own republic. But France then conquered this in 1767, didn't only
*23:13.020- 23:19.020* :  took over, but Corsica then managed to produce perhaps the most famous French leader that
*23:19.020- 23:22.840* :  country's ever had. Nick, I'm going to give you a quiz. Who is the most famous Corsica?
*23:23.380- 23:25.080* :  I think I know this one, Napoleon Bonaparte.
*23:25.080- 23:30.040* :  Napoleon Bonaparte indeed, who then went to Conquer half of Europe and he certainly kept control
*23:30.040- 23:35.760* :  over Corsica. But that independent struggle never went away. It ebbed and flowed. It got very
*23:35.760- 23:41.660* :  violent in the 1970s with lots of different groups involved. I went to Corsica to report on the
*23:41.660- 23:46.180* :  nationalist struggle and I'm not going to pretend. It's very confusing. There was the ARC,
*23:46.180- 23:52.300* :  the FPCL, the FLNC, and a lot of these groups were fighting each other. They seem to spend more time
*23:52.300- 23:57.680* :  killing their rivals rather than attacking the French state. Also, the politics there has always
*23:57.680- 24:04.300* :  been mixed up with organized crimes. Some people use these armed groups as really nothing more than
*24:04.300- 24:10.040* :  highly efficient gangsters. But the amount of independence never went away and President Macron
*24:10.040- 24:16.100* :  is now offering a solution. So why is he speaking about this now? It's something the President
*24:16.100- 24:20.200* :  offered when he was standing for re-election last year. What happened was that one of the
*24:20.200- 24:26.040* :  major nationalist leaders, a man called Yvonne Colonna, was in prison and he was murdered there.
*24:26.040- 24:32.420* :  Now that set off very angry protest marches, it really looked like the situation in Corsica could
*24:32.420- 24:38.020* :  spiral out of control again. So what President Macron said is, if you re-elect me, I will come up with
*24:38.020- 24:43.780* :  a compromise deal and on Thursday he went to the Corsica regional assembly and said, look,
*24:44.200- 24:49.180* :  we can find some kind of compromise where we will recognize this island's unique culture,
*24:49.600- 24:54.920* :  its unique identity, give it more autonomy, but within the French constitution. And he said,
*24:54.920- 25:00.400* :  I'm going to give you six months to come up with a model of autonomy that's acceptable to all sides.
*25:00.400- 25:04.560* :  So what would a deal on autonomy mean in practice? Well, the first thing the Corsica
*25:04.560- 25:09.900* :  Nationalists want is official recognition of their language, which I can tell you is nothing
*25:09.900- 25:15.220* :  like French. But a really burning issue is that many there feel the island has been taken over
*25:15.220- 25:20.420* :  by people from mainland France and a lot of them want a ban on outsiders from France,
*25:20.420- 25:26.100* :  mainland France, buying homes there. Paul Moss. The family of a black girl at the centre of
*25:26.100- 25:31.960* :  a racism route in Irish sport has told the BBC the apology they received from gymnastics
*25:31.960- 25:37.860* :  island this week was useless. A video which went viral online earlier this week showed their
*25:37.860- 25:44.100* :  daughter being passed over by a judge handing out participation medals at an event in Dublin a
*25:44.100- 25:49.400* :  year and a half ago where she was the only black child. Stephanie Higgity spoke to the family
*25:49.400- 25:55.520* :  in their first broadcast interview. The parents who were not naming told the BBC they were profoundly
*25:55.580- 26:00.740* :  disappointed with how they had been treated by gymnastics Ireland over the past 18 months.
*26:01.520- 26:06.080* :  They said they felt the authorities were trying to cover up what had happened despite an
*26:06.080- 26:11.060* :  apology sent to them on Sunday. It's almost useless to be honest with you. It's so useless.
*26:12.700- 26:20.660* :  It's like I cried for so long and then millions of people cried with me before I could get this.
*26:21.520- 26:26.980* :  They only sent an apology because the world wanted to tempt you. The incident happened in March 2022
*26:27.840- 26:32.200* :  but the video went viral last week when it was leaked online. The family don't know by whom.
*26:33.100- 26:38.400* :  They said they were disappointed that gymnastics Ireland didn't show up to the mediation session
*26:38.800- 26:44.160* :  organized between themselves and the judging question in August this year and with how long the
*26:44.160- 26:50.000* :  process has taken. Gymnastics Ireland told the BBC that this was the first incident of racism
*26:50.000- 26:56.660* :  that had been reported to it since the organisation was founded in 1975 and said there have been many
*26:56.660- 27:01.880* :  learnings. It added that the delays had been caused by human error, threats of legal action,
*27:01.880- 27:07.520* :  intervention by third parties and what it called our own understanding that this was a complaint
*27:07.520- 27:13.980* :  from the parents against the official. We contacted the official in question for comment but have
*27:13.980- 27:20.800* :  received no reply. That report by Stephanie Higgity. The troubled Chinese property developer Evergrande
*27:20.800- 27:26.040* :  has confirmed that its billionaire founder and chairman has been detained on suspicion of criminal
*27:26.040- 27:30.720* :  activity. The company said its shares would remain suspended until further notice.
*27:30.720- 27:37.300* :  Stephen McDonald reports from Beijing. China's property crisis continues with huge portions of
*27:37.300- 27:42.600* :  the industry under considerable pressure over debt. Property makes up a quarter of the country's
*27:42.600- 27:49.280* :  gross domestic product and within that sector Evergrande looms large as the one-time symbolic champion
*27:49.280- 27:55.400* :  of a booming economy. During the decades of success what was not known was the extent to which the
*27:55.400- 28:00.960* :  money owed to creditors by the company was building and building, resulting in liabilities
*28:00.960- 28:07.860* :  which amount to roughly the size of the entire GDP of a country like Finland. Then today Evergrande's
*28:07.860- 28:13.660* :  shares were again suspended on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Will Chen, the researcher at four-cythe
*28:13.660- 28:20.740* :  bar Asia, said there were two likely reasons for this. The report that the company's chairman had
*28:20.740- 28:26.380* :  been detained he said. The second was to do with issues related to Evergrande's restructuring plan.
*28:27.020- 28:33.220* :  The developer has now confirmed in a statement that Huai Guyan has been taken away by investigators
*28:33.880- 28:38.620* :  due to suspicions that it committed crimes and that the company's shares would remain suspended
*28:38.620- 28:44.360* :  until further notice. Despite all this it is still possible that a way to save Evergrande can be
*28:44.360- 28:49.760* :  found. The government has to this point not shown it willingness to bail out China's property
*28:50.260- 28:55.800* :  developers which have dug themselves into this hole using overdevelopment as a way of staying
*28:55.800- 29:00.620* :  ahead of those to whom they owe vast amounts of money. Steven McDonald
*29:01.720- 29:05.880* :  Next to some music and it's been a pretty remarkable year for the Japanese British
*29:05.880- 29:11.900* :  singer and actress Rina Sawayama. She performed at the massive Glastonbury Festival in England first
*29:11.900- 29:18.040* :  on her own and then on stage with Elton John. She's appeared on the cover of British Vogue in a Hollywood
*29:18.040- 29:24.020* :  blockbuster and she's been called the future of queer pop music. Music critics have been
*29:24.020- 29:29.580* :  wondering about the inspiration behind her album hold the girl. Now she's revealed the painful
*29:29.580- 29:36.520* :  truth to the BBC's gender and identity correspondent Megamone. This is the end of the tour so it's
*29:36.520- 29:45.900* :  like the last day it's been a really intense run. Rina Sawayama is about to perform on a rooftop
*29:45.900- 29:59.540* :  New York stage in front of over 3,000 fans. The Japanese British artist has been called the
*29:59.540- 30:05.760* :  new face of LGBT representation in pop music. She's been touring internationally for almost a year
*30:05.760- 30:12.200* :  promoting her album hold the girl. In previous interviews she said the album was inspired by a very
*30:12.200- 30:23.900* :  painful experience but didn't share exactly what it was. I've actually never talked about this
*30:23.920- 30:28.100* :  in any other interview. This is the first time I'm talking about this but essentially through
*30:28.600- 30:35.720* :  doing sex therapy, sex and relationship therapy I realized that something that I thought was a
*30:35.720- 30:43.460* :  relationship that I had when I was 17 was actually I was groomed and why it happened then,
*30:43.880- 30:53.360* :  why that realization happened in my 30s was because I was finally his age. It completely broke
*30:53.360- 31:00.860* :  my whole world apart because at the time after you know it came to light that that was what was
*31:00.860- 31:07.780* :  happening in my in my school. Basically it was a school teacher. I was so badly slut-shamed
*31:08.240- 31:14.640* :  that I developed so much shame around my sexuality and lost completely my sense of self.
*31:16.780- 31:21.720* :  It's been a significant year in Rina Sawayama's career. She was on the cover of British Vogue
*31:21.720- 31:27.040* :  magazine, starred in the Hollywood film John Wick Fall with Keanu Reeves and was on glass
*31:27.040- 31:33.640* :  in Bre music festivals iconic pyramid stage with Elton John. Rina saw the touring as
*31:33.640- 31:39.580* :  been a cathartic experience and her audience connect with her music so they may only just be
*31:39.580- 31:45.460* :  learning the true meaning behind some of the songs. I haven't talked about this in specifics. I've
*31:45.460- 31:51.320* :  just said you know it's about a period in my life when I was younger and but I know the truth
*31:51.320- 31:57.800* :  than when I look out to the audience and I see fans or women connecting to it. I'm like maybe you know
*31:58.040- 32:00.440* :  maybe you know what I'm talking about. Maybe you're feeling it right now.
*32:05.580- 32:11.240* :  Now to Northern England and police investigating the felling of one of the UK's most famous trees
*32:11.240- 32:18.040* :  have arrested a 16 year old boy. The tree growing at a place called Sikamore Gap had been next to
*32:18.040- 32:24.440* :  Hadrian's Wall or a former Roman defensive fortification for nearly 200 years. The tree even
*32:24.440- 32:29.840* :  appeared in a Hollywood movie and became a global landmark. Alison Freeman has been to the site at
*32:29.840- 32:36.020* :  Northumberland National Park. It was a tree known the world over. Its silhouette was commonly
*32:36.020- 32:41.380* :  photographed and it provided the backdrop for important moments in people's lives. It even
*32:41.380- 32:54.100* :  featured in the 1991 Hollywood film Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. But it was failed not by storm
*32:54.100- 33:00.480* :  Agnes but by what many are calling a deliberate act of vandalism a clean cut with guide marks visible
*33:00.480- 33:06.600* :  on the stump. The question everyone asking is why. A question I asked the head of the Northumberland
*33:06.600- 33:13.660* :  National Park Authority Tony Gates. Well I can't even speculate on that you know it's really sad
*33:13.660- 33:20.800* :  that someone's felt a drive to do this because I can imagine whoever or whatever people did this
*33:21.460- 33:26.600* :  know how important Sikamore Gap is you know people have been proposed to hear people have
*33:26.600- 33:31.040* :  celebrated anniversaries you know this this is part of the cultural heritage of this part of the
*33:31.040- 33:35.900* :  world and I think it's just been lost needlessly. People visiting here today were visibly shocked
*33:35.900- 33:41.920* :  some were in tears. Everybody still feels very bereft very you know I mean who will do it for
*33:41.920- 33:47.800* :  goodness sake. Let's absolutely devastating I mean it's heartbreaking. It's just a special
*33:47.800- 33:52.220* :  place I propose my wife here. People hugging and crying remember like remembering loved ones
*33:52.220- 33:57.060* :  that they'd scattered ashes here one lady said she'd shed all of her birthdays and celebrations
*33:57.060- 34:02.260* :  with her kids here. Detectives say a 16 year old boy is in custody and is helping police with
*34:02.260- 34:08.260* :  their inquiries. Locals and visitors alike are now struggling to understand why such a beautiful
*34:08.260- 34:16.040* :  tree has been lost. Alison Freeman in Northern England. And that's all from us for now but there will
