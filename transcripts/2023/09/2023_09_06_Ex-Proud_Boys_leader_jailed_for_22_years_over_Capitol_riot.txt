01:43.640 - 01:46.220:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:49.220 - 01:53.140:  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 6th of September, these are our main
01:53.140 - 01:57.800:  stories. The former leader of the Proud Boys Far Right Group in the United States has been
01:57.800 - 02:04.300:  sentenced to 22 years in jail for his role in the attack on the US capital in January 2021.
02:05.180 - 02:09.960:  Spain's football federation has sacked the head coach of its World Cup winning women's team,
02:09.960 - 02:17.460:  a close ally of Luis Rubiales, the suspended president. The army in Bukina Faso says 17 soldiers
02:17.460 - 02:22.680:  and 36 volunteer fighters have been killed in clashes with Islamist militants.
02:24.940 - 02:29.980:  Also in this podcast. Right now, New York is one of the top tourist destinations in the world,
02:29.980 - 02:35.500:  and at least looking back over the last decade, Airbnb has been a pretty significant part of
02:35.500 - 02:40.640:  the tourist accommodation landscape. But now officials in the city say that visitors will only be
02:40.640 - 02:45.900:  able to book such a accommodation for a maximum of two guests and the host must be present during the
02:45.920 - 02:55.540:  stay. We begin in Washington. The former leader of the Far Right Proud Boys militia has been sentenced
02:55.540 - 03:01.940:  to 22 years in prison for his role in the attack on the US capital by supporters of Donald Trump.
03:02.600 - 03:09.740:  In the Rique Tadeo was not in Washington on January the 6th, 2021, but was accused of directing
03:09.740 - 03:15.560:  the military style assault on the capital by members of the Proud Boys. I spoke to our correspondent
03:15.560 - 03:20.360:  Wira Davis, who was outside the court in Washington. The prosecution remembered, I'd ask for a
03:20.360 - 03:25.600:  sentence of 33 years. The judge said that kind of sentence has usually had it down to somebody
03:25.600 - 03:32.220:  responsible for a terrorist attack flowing up a building or an attack in which several people
03:32.220 - 03:36.380:  were killed. Therefore, he wasn't going to hand down a sentence at that level. But mindful of
03:36.380 - 03:42.060:  the violent events of January the 6th, of course, events in which five people didn't actually
03:42.060 - 03:47.800:  lose their lives, he said that terror should be sentenced to 22 years in jail because he was quite
03:47.800 - 03:53.080:  clearly the orchestrator, the organizer of what the judge called a seditious conspiracy.
03:53.600 - 03:59.040:  That conspiracy was, of course, to stop the peaceful transfer, the constitutional transfer
03:59.040 - 04:05.240:  power for one president to another. The Proud Boys had gone to the capital that day along with
04:05.240 - 04:11.660:  other pro-Trump groups like the Oatipers in order to try and stop Mike Pence with the vice
04:11.660 - 04:17.760:  president from formally accepting the votes off the 2020 election of the election college
04:18.360 - 04:23.180:  and handing over power to Joe Biden. They clearly wanted to do stop that happening violently.
04:24.020 - 04:31.660:  And despite what was a very contritious speech by Tadio himself on the stand, in which he expressed
04:31.660 - 04:35.880:  remorse for what he'd done for the judge on the letter that he was clearly the leader of this
04:35.880 - 04:41.420:  conspiracy and sent him down for 20 years. Now, Wira, this was the last of the high profile
04:41.420 - 04:46.800:  prosecutions over the German VI riots until the biggest of them all, of course, Donald Trump's.
04:47.100 - 04:51.620:  Yeah, I mean, what's really interesting about this case is that Enrico Tario wasn't present
04:51.620 - 04:57.780:  in Washington DC on that day because he'd been arrested and banned from the city two days earlier.
04:58.280 - 05:03.920:  So his argument that he wasn't present at the capital didn't really help him. Now, you remember
05:03.920 - 05:09.840:  that Donald Trump is due to appear on his own charges, not quite such serious charges of seditious
05:09.840 - 05:16.900:  conspiracy, but he is due to appear on his own charges of trying to overturn and deny the result
05:16.900 - 05:22.560:  of the 2020 election. The defense thus far has been that he wasn't present at the capital.
05:22.560 - 05:27.680:  He was further down the mall, but of course, we all heard, and the prosecution said everybody
05:27.680 - 05:34.080:  heard Donald Trump encouraging his supporters, including the proud boys to go down and to march
05:34.080 - 05:39.240:  on the capital. So that defense that Donald Trump might want to use when he appears here
05:39.560 - 05:45.060:  at this federal court has, I'm standing in front of, in March. That defense that he wasn't here
05:45.060 - 05:50.440:  at the time might not work in his favor. Sorry for the sound quality on that. We caught where
05:50.440 - 05:57.160:  a just after the sentencing was made here in Washington. Spain's football coach has been key
05:57.160 - 06:02.240:  to the remarkable growth of women's football. The national team has, of course, just won the World
06:02.240 - 06:07.760:  Cup. So it might seem a strange time for the football federation there to sack Jorge Vilda,
06:08.320 - 06:13.620:  but that is exactly what's just happened. He's been replaced by a woman, a former member of the
06:13.620 - 06:18.980:  national team, once said Tommy. The context to this is, of course, that Mr. Vilda is considered
06:18.980 - 06:24.400:  to be a close ally of Luis Rubiales, the suspended president of the football federation,
06:24.900 - 06:30.020:  who has been under fire for kissing the player Jenny Hermosso on the lips without her consent as
06:30.020 - 06:34.780:  the team celebrated winning the tournament. This is the reaction to the sacking of the Spanish
06:34.780 - 06:42.540:  football coach. It seems to me that it has come at the wrong time and that it is always insufficient.
06:42.540 - 06:48.820:  With this issue, we have to be much more cautious. We have to be much tougher and this kind of thing
06:48.820 - 06:55.840:  must not happen. So, well, we still need much more, not just to dismiss one man, but to ensure that
06:55.840 - 07:01.360:  this kind of behavior is not centralised in general, not only what has happened to this girl,
07:01.360 - 07:07.700:  but what has happened to all of us? Others felt Jorge Vilda's success at the World Cup demonstrated
07:07.700 - 07:16.120:  he'd done some good by the team, but acknowledged he had to go. It's laid and it's what had to be done,
07:16.120 - 07:21.460:  especially if the girls are unhappy with him, despite as much as he has achieved, which is an
07:21.460 - 07:28.040:  impressive and maximum level of success as a coach. Guillem Balaguer is a Spanish football journalist.
07:28.860 - 07:32.680:  Tim Franks asked him why the Spanish Federation has sacked Jorge Vilda now.
07:57.740 - 08:03.720:  Their opposition to those decision-makers didn't name them, but included Vilda. They had
08:03.720 - 08:10.020:  protested in the past against his methods. What is more surprising, if you like, is that that came
08:10.020 - 08:16.780:  hand in hand with a statement by Pedro Rocha, the new temporary president, installed by Rubiales,
08:16.780 - 08:23.060:  the former president, but that statement is quite strong in terms of talking about structural changes
08:23.060 - 08:29.040:  are needed, and we all hope that the bill that going is the beginning of those changes.
08:29.240 - 08:36.440:  The statement from the Football Federation about the firing of Vilda, all it did was sort of say,
08:36.440 - 08:41.360:  yes, we're going to dispense with his services, but what a great man he is. There's no explanation
08:41.360 - 08:46.680:  for why they're getting rid of him. You want black and white. You want the villain to be an
08:46.680 - 08:51.600:  absolutely total villain, but you know what? It thinks that it'll be more complex than that,
08:51.600 - 08:56.660:  because he's one of the woke up. He created a coaching staff that helped the national team to
08:56.660 - 09:02.440:  get to winning a woke up, considering that 15 players a year and a half earlier had decided not
09:02.440 - 09:06.320:  to join him, and out of those 15, which was supposed to be the best players we had, only three
09:06.320 - 09:11.200:  went to Australia. So if you look at it from only that point of view, you think, yes,
09:11.200 - 09:15.580:  don't know, good job. But of course, when you start scratching a little bit deeper, what you see
09:15.580 - 09:20.160:  is that the players have not liked his methods for a long time. They have been complaining,
09:20.160 - 09:26.440:  but what happens when women complain about where they work and the bosses are with those that take
09:26.440 - 09:30.440:  the decisions? They know how to hurt. By getting to build that, you're sounding in the message that
09:30.440 - 09:36.900:  we do okay. We're listening now. The big question is what about Rubialis himself? Why is he still there?
09:37.160 - 09:43.040:  He's suspended by FIFA, but yeah, he's shadow is very long. I'm going to put you the hellish
09:43.220 - 09:48.060:  proposition, which is that on the 24th of November FIFA, who have suspended him for three months,
09:48.060 - 09:55.280:  as you know, haven't resolved his case yet, and he then still has been suspended. And he says,
09:55.280 - 10:01.560:  okay, well, I want my job back. While there are other judges, judicial judges and sporting
10:01.560 - 10:06.480:  judges and political judges, trying to get rid of him. But why doesn't the football federation
10:06.480 - 10:13.360:  just get rid of him? That's a good question, because they have the power to do that. All they
10:13.360 - 10:19.520:  said is we want you to resign knowing for a while that he wouldn't. They say, of course, now that
10:19.520 - 10:24.700:  they embarrassed by his behavior, but the mechanism they've got to get rid of him is a vote of no
10:24.700 - 10:31.220:  confidence. The problem is, Rocha has been chosen by Rubialis. And let's say that he actually wants
10:31.220 - 10:35.560:  to get rid of him through a vote of no confidence. He knows everybody else in that table that will be
10:35.560 - 10:41.520:  part of that decision. And many of them are Rubialis people. Guillaume Balagay, a Spanish football journalist.
10:42.780 - 10:48.720:  The army in Bikina Faso says 17 soldiers and 36 volunteer fighters have been killed during
10:48.720 - 10:53.540:  heavy clashes with Islamist militants in the north of the country, near the border with Marley.
10:54.060 - 10:58.560:  Extremist fighters linked to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group have been carrying out frequent
10:58.560 - 11:04.640:  attacks since 2015. More details from our Africa regional editor, Will Ross. A statement from the
11:04.640 - 11:09.620:  army in Bikina Faso mentioned brave, fearless troops putting up fierce resistance and repelling
11:09.620 - 11:14.020:  what it called a terrorist attack. It also said dozens of enemy fighters were killed.
11:14.020 - 11:19.240:  It's hard to verify exactly what took place in this remote area close to the border with Marley.
11:19.240 - 11:24.600:  But the omission that 53 members of the security forces were killed by the Islamist extremists
11:24.820 - 11:30.200:  makes this yet another grim day for Bikina Faso's military. The men who carried out two
11:30.200 - 11:35.420:  coups last year and then forced French troops to leave now appear to be turning to Russia
11:35.880 - 11:40.580:  in a bid to stop the insurgency from spreading further across the country. Will Ross.
11:41.600 - 11:47.720:  It has been two years since the Taliban took over in Afghanistan and since then more than 8,000
11:47.720 - 11:55.260:  LGBTQ plus people have made requests to the NGO Rainbow Railroad for help to leave the country.
11:55.820 - 12:01.860:  The BBC's Bertin Hun met one of those people who made it out of the country. He's now living in the UK.
12:06.060 - 12:11.440:  I knew that this is not the kind of place an environment that I should be open or out.
12:11.620 - 12:14.440:  Even though there were times that I was just being me.
12:14.440 - 12:19.240:  That's Leyla, not their real name. I had to drop school like literally two weeks before the
12:19.240 - 12:24.160:  final exams. I had to stop going to school because it was violent. The family didn't accept them.
12:24.300 - 12:29.520:  They did their own version of conversion therapy which was me drinking this black liquid which is
12:29.520 - 12:33.900:  called Sorma. Mostly people in South Asian countries put it on their eyes to make it like more
12:33.900 - 12:38.100:  black but the effect of that is it makes your voice more masculine.
12:38.100 - 12:43.900:  Life in Afghanistan wasn't easy for Leyla but in August 2021 Kabul fell to the Taliban.
12:45.300 - 12:48.700:  I was like okay this is Kabul it's not going to happen like to woke up the next morning.
12:48.700 - 12:52.640:  I saw they were Taliban like literally with all their outfits long beard.
12:52.640 - 12:57.620:  And life got much more dangerous. Do not look flamboyant, do not put on jeans or anything.
12:57.620 - 13:02.820:  I was wearing the traditional clothes. I was about to open the car and someone hit me really bad.
13:02.820 - 13:07.800:  I heard my bones like another look back and that was a toilet. My eyes were almost full of tears
13:07.800 - 13:13.480:  and I was like why? And she said like don't you know how to walk like a man. If I react any way
13:13.480 - 13:17.980:  that you wouldn't like it, you would definitely shoot me on the spot. It was clear to them they had
13:17.980 - 13:22.180:  to leave the country. And there was another female friend of mine. So she was with me like okay
13:22.660 - 13:25.920:  you're the husband and the wife and we're going to pass through the security checks.
13:26.400 - 13:32.140:  We could see how they were picking people out of the lines and like you're coming out with us.
13:33.380 - 13:38.400:  We waited at the airport then yeah we flew out at least I know that I won't be killed today.
13:38.780 - 13:42.220:  The Rainbow Railroad is the organization that supported Leila on this journey.
13:42.380 - 13:46.660:  Their name is a nod to the underground railroad, the historical network that helped
13:46.660 - 13:54.040:  enslaved Africans flee the US. So far we have successfully relocated 417 individuals
13:54.040 - 13:59.340:  of Afghan nationality. Earlier I caught up with Devon Matthews from the Rainbow Railroad.
13:59.460 - 14:03.040:  They fill out a form that kind of contains basic information around their history and story
14:03.040 - 14:06.680:  of persecution in the current situation and they're in on their biographical information
14:06.720 - 14:11.820:  and do a deep dive into verifying the information that they've given us.
14:11.820 - 14:16.980:  People like Leila, the organization works with governments to relocate LGBTQ plus people
14:16.980 - 14:22.660:  in safer countries. We have to layer that vulnerability and triaging assessment on top of
14:22.660 - 14:25.240:  availability of pathways to support people.
14:25.540 - 14:29.940:  Leila is now living in the UK. Britain has helped him live authentically in the open.
14:30.160 - 14:35.520:  I go to uni, I'm doing a master's degree, I got a scholarship for uni, I study, I work,
14:35.760 - 14:37.200:  it's great, I'm doing a guide.
14:38.400 - 14:44.280:  The airport was by Bertin Hoon. New York City officials have introduced legislation which
14:44.280 - 14:50.560:  in effect bans holiday rentals lasting less than 30 days. The move is an attempt to ensure
14:50.560 - 14:55.580:  affordable housing is available to New York residents and to curb anti-social behaviour.
14:55.580 - 15:01.600:  All visitors can now only hire homes through platforms like Airbnb for a maximum of two guests
15:02.260 - 15:07.100:  and the host must live there and be present during the stay. It's expected that thousands of homes
15:07.100 - 15:12.540:  will be removed from websites from Tuesday. Fairly to comply with the legislation could result
15:12.540 - 15:15.980:  in up to $5,000 in fines per stay.
15:16.520 - 15:23.040:  Oben Thompson spoke to Dr David Wachsmuth, associate professor of urban planning at McGill
15:23.040 - 15:28.160:  University in Montreal. He's researched the impact of Airbnb on New York extensively.
15:28.860 - 15:33.320:  Right now, New York is one of the top tourist destinations in the world and at least looking
15:33.320 - 15:38.520:  back over the last decade, Airbnb has been a pretty significant part of the tourist accommodation
15:38.520 - 15:44.540:  landscape. But the fact is that unlike a lot of, let's say, smaller towns, kind of resort
15:44.540 - 15:50.900:  destinations that really rely on home sharing to ensure adequate supply of tourist accommodations,
15:50.960 - 15:58.020:  New York's not exactly hurting for hotels. So if the changing rules result in many thousands of
15:58.020 - 16:02.980:  air being deactivated as I think most people expect it will, it's still going to amount to not
16:02.980 - 16:07.760:  much more than a drop in the bucket in terms of the overall flow of visitors who come to the city
16:07.760 - 16:12.620:  every year. So that's the impact on New York. Talk to me about the impact on Airbnb itself because
16:12.620 - 16:18.700:  we know New York City, a huge generator of revenue for that firm. That's right. And if you go
16:18.700 - 16:24.380:  back about a decade ago, New York was the second or third largest market for Airbnb alongside London
16:24.380 - 16:28.580:  and Paris. But that hasn't been true for some time now. And part of the reason for that is that,
16:29.100 - 16:33.120:  you know, frankly, the city government's been at war with Airbnb for this last decade,
16:33.120 - 16:40.400:  trying to find a way to enforce what they see as the kind of long standing rules prohibiting
16:40.740 - 16:44.920:  commercial short-term rentals in the city. So I think, you know, Airbnb's definitely going to be
16:44.920 - 16:49.840:  hurting from the loss of business. But the days where New York was one of their most
16:49.840 - 16:52.360:  significant markets actually are someone in the past at this point.
16:52.760 - 16:57.320:  Dr. David Wawksmuth from McGill University in Montreal, will Airbnb,
16:57.340 - 17:00.500:  argues that the change will be bad for tourism?
17:03.380 - 17:08.780:  Still to come. There are challenges around the capture and movement. This is something
17:09.260 - 17:14.600:  Rhino conservationists have developed very strong technical experience in over time.
17:15.160 - 17:21.140:  The great white Rhino release, 2000, will go from captivity into the wild. But how do we make sure
17:21.140 - 17:24.660:  it's good news for the species and not just for the poachers?

19:14.520 - 19:16.240:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
19:17.380 - 19:22.380:  Now what's in a name? Well a lot of trouble it seems at least in India. Or should that be
19:22.640 - 19:26.200:  Barat. That is the question now causing a stir,
19:26.200 - 19:30.820:  because invitations sent out by the Indian president in advance of the G20 summit
19:31.540 - 19:33.220:  referred to Barat, not India.
19:33.680 - 19:36.260:  Barat is widely used domestically in India.
19:36.700 - 19:38.440:  And the name is mentioned in the constitution.
19:38.440 - 19:44.420:  But opposition parties say any attempt to change the country's identity would amount to distorting
19:44.420 - 19:48.860:  history. I asked our South Asia regional editor Amarassan Etorajan.
19:48.860 - 19:51.300:  Why Barat was mentioned on this invitation?
19:51.780 - 19:54.580:  Now I've seen the photograph of this invitation on social media.
19:54.580 - 19:57.780:  I would say it's the president of Barat, which is quite unusual,
19:58.380 - 20:03.940:  because this invitation is to all the dignitaries who are coming for the G20 summit this weekend.
20:04.680 - 20:09.740:  And now the Indian media is saying that this is the first time the Indian president has used this
20:09.740 - 20:17.000:  word Barat in an official invitation. Now that is triggered a huge debate in fact controversy
20:17.000 - 20:23.540:  in India. The social media is on fire with why people should be using whether Barat or India.
20:23.980 - 20:29.520:  Now these two names are being used interchangeably in India itself. If you look at the official
20:29.520 - 20:35.360:  word, the Prime Minister of India, the President of India, but India is also known as Barat.
20:35.680 - 20:40.540:  For example, people who speak especially northern India, where they will use Barat,
20:40.540 - 20:45.800:  which is a very common term, whereas non-Hindi speakers might use the word India more.
20:46.320 - 20:53.480:  If you look at the constitution of India, the first article would say India that is Barat
20:54.020 - 20:59.700:  shall be a union of states. So the both were being interchangeably used, but now the issue is,
20:59.840 - 21:03.680:  the Hindu nationalists have been calling for the name change for a long time.
21:04.040 - 21:08.920:  That is what is triggered this controversy with opposition parties, especially the Congress party
21:08.920 - 21:15.880:  and others are saying, this is an attempt to impose a particular ideology and already India
21:15.880 - 21:20.480:  name is there. You are distorting history by changing the name to Barat.
21:20.740 - 21:26.540:  So the Indian President's office has chosen this very high profile time to make this
21:26.540 - 21:32.980:  quite strong statement. Some people are supporting it saying, it marks the end of the slave
21:32.980 - 21:38.640:  mentality, but not everyone sees it like that of course. Now many people, especially as you say,
21:38.640 - 21:43.060:  like Hindu nationalists and the supporters would prefer the name Barat, but Barat is the name being
21:43.060 - 21:48.980:  used by everyone during a normal day to day discussion. But I have to say, there has been no
21:48.980 - 21:54.560:  official response from the government of India, whether they want to change India's name to Barat.
21:55.260 - 21:59.680:  Only the President's office invitation is the only clue, but some of the ministers have been
21:59.680 - 22:05.240:  coming out and talking in support of why should we have the name India, which is a colonial invention,
22:05.940 - 22:10.700:  which many people can contest. And we should now change to our name to Barat, which has been
22:10.700 - 22:16.260:  mentioned in the ancient Indian text. That is raising a lot of questions about people asking,
22:16.260 - 22:23.400:  okay, so what will you do about Indian version? How will you call it now? Or if it is a reserve
22:23.400 - 22:28.140:  bank of India, which is a central bank, how would you call that now? So these are some of the
22:28.140 - 22:33.060:  questions being raised and what is the need to change? Because India is well known outside the
22:33.060 - 22:38.960:  country. Globally India is known now if you are going to change Barat, that's going to have an
22:38.960 - 22:46.080:  impact on the brand name India itself. Ambrassam Eterarjan. Africa's first climate summit is
22:46.080 - 22:52.140:  taking place in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The talks are focusing on mobilizing finance for
22:52.140 - 22:56.460:  the continent's response to climate change. Whilst Africa is suffering from some of the most
22:56.460 - 23:01.760:  severe impacts of climate change, the continent only receives about 12% of the money it needs to
23:01.760 - 23:08.420:  cope. Meanwhile, communities living around Lake Aparringo in Kenya's Great Rift Valley have filed
23:08.420 - 23:13.520:  the first class action of its kind in the country. They're suing the government over the
23:13.520 - 23:18.500:  adverse effects of climate change. Water levels have doubled over the past decade,
23:18.500 - 23:23.880:  displacing thousands of people. Government officials have not responded to the BBC's request for
23:23.880 - 23:32.940:  comments. Masjima reports. It's a refreshing morning. The sign is a beautiful golden yellow ball
23:32.940 - 23:38.820:  rising from the rolling hills as rays shine on the vast fresh waters of Lake Aparringo.
23:41.720 - 23:46.660:  The fishermen's boats dot the calm glimming water. I notice one of them limping.
23:47.620 - 23:54.440:  Joseph Atumatels may he is a victim of a hippo attack. The water level is high. Lake
23:54.440 - 24:00.220:  animals come close to the shores. That is where the problem is. It gives us less room to maneuver.
24:00.600 - 24:04.160:  By the time you run away, they attack and there's no way to escape.
24:06.080 - 24:10.660:  A few kilometres behind me, there were people's homes. There were schools. There were hospitals.
24:11.500 - 24:16.380:  But you cannot really tell any of those things existed because they have all been swallowed
24:16.380 - 24:21.040:  by the lake. And people have been pushed out of this place. They are now living elsewhere,
24:21.040 - 24:26.320:  but they still come back. There are women who are washing their laundry here. Oblivious of the fact
24:26.320 - 24:33.920:  that this water is now heavily infested by crocodiles and they do attack them sometimes.
24:37.640 - 24:42.460:  On the shores, women are busy cleaning up their fish as still feed deadly predators,
24:43.040 - 24:50.600:  the Nile crocodiles swim nearby. Be careful, one woman wants.
24:52.840 - 24:58.960:  People in this area have a lot of tails around low-send damage linked to the rising waters of
24:59.140 - 25:06.360:  Lake Beringo. And I'm going to meet a woman who lost not only her land, her home,
25:07.420 - 25:11.500:  but also lost her leg when she was attacked by a crocodile.
25:12.280 - 25:13.680:  Very, very, very, very.
25:15.280 - 25:21.340:  Winnie Cabin is a 29-year-old mother of six. She warmly welcomes me and offers a seat outside her
25:21.340 - 25:28.600:  grass-touched mud house. I was dragged into the lake. My leg was broken. The crocodile took away
25:28.600 - 25:36.320:  part of it. She says as she shows me her prosthetic leg. The incisand waters have taken even more from
25:36.320 - 25:43.600:  her, flooding her home and from land. A long time ago, we would farm and get our food.
25:44.440 - 25:49.840:  Nowadays, when it rains, we experience loss in destruction. We are praying that God will help us
25:50.280 - 25:55.460:  so that the lake does not swell further and displace us again because we have nowhere else to go.
26:00.740 - 26:05.900:  Environmentalists say the lake has doubled in size over the last decade because of heavy
26:05.900 - 26:10.860:  rain fall linked to climate change. For the first time, communities here have sued the
26:10.860 - 26:16.280:  government for failing to respond to the climate change crisis. Benzen Chipkonga is a representative
26:16.280 - 26:21.620:  of the communities. We are representing the larger majority of Beringo. We expect a fair ruling.
26:21.960 - 26:28.540:  We expect a fair compensation and we expect them to come and renovate even schools,
26:28.540 - 26:34.800:  even the bridges and other public utilities that have been distracted.
26:35.620 - 26:39.940:  According to the United Nations Environment Programme, climate change code cases have
26:39.940 - 26:45.100:  more than doubled globally in the last five years as communities seek action and justice.
26:45.620 - 26:49.340:  O'Monio Wino is an international environmental lawyer who is handling the case.
26:49.700 - 26:54.400:  We have not seen anything like this on the African continent. That makes it quite significant.
26:54.400 - 26:59.000:  When the code finally makes a determination, it might become a part breaking precedent
26:59.000 - 27:04.520:  in the area of climate change law, not only for Kenya, but it will be quoted also globally and in
27:04.520 - 27:12.760:  other African countries. The tales of loss in damage from the swelling leg are chilling.
27:12.780 - 27:18.700:  The residents took off an unknown number of people, including children being dragged into the
27:18.700 - 27:26.700:  waters never to be seen again. Many of them have nowhere to relocate to and every day the risks
27:26.700 - 27:32.680:  of staying here increases. That report was by Mercy Juma in Kenya.
27:33.920 - 27:39.740:  A new computer analysis tool built by the UN suggests that around six billion tons of sand
27:39.740 - 27:45.800:  is dredged from the world's oceans annually, endangering marine life and coastal communities.
27:45.800 - 27:51.160:  The UN's Environment Agency says some dredging vessels were acting as vacuum cleaners,
27:51.160 - 27:55.600:  extracting both sand and microorganisms that fish feed on.
27:55.600 - 28:02.020:  The agency's spokesman Pascal Paduzzi said the current situation was unsustainable for marine life.
28:02.300 - 28:09.760:  The impact on the fish's tremendous, the fact that you are removing all the bottom of the sea
28:09.800 - 28:14.240:  is changing. There is no more life there. The life needs to come back so you need to allow time
28:14.240 - 28:20.620:  to come back. If you don't take all the sand, if you leave like 50, 60 centimeters of sand,
28:20.620 - 28:26.780:  life can come back. But if you are taking all the sand to the bare rock, then it's a different
28:26.780 - 28:32.360:  status and the life may not recover. Scientists say sand is amongst the most exploited natural
28:32.360 - 28:38.480:  resource in the world used in the production of concrete and glass. Now to what seems to be good
28:38.480 - 28:44.220:  news for the white rhino, there are about 16,000 of them still left in the world, mostly in South
28:44.220 - 28:50.160:  Africa. 2,000 of them have been enclosed there in a fenced reserve as part of a breeding program,
28:50.520 - 28:55.980:  but now it's being announced that they will be gradually reintroduced into the wild over a 10-year
28:55.980 - 29:02.200:  period. Joe Shaw of the Conservation Group saved the rhino international told me that with the
29:02.200 - 29:08.460:  release of these animals, the hard work begins. There are challenges around the capture and movement,
29:08.460 - 29:14.220:  kind of the logistics of the translocations. This is something rhino conservationists have developed
29:14.220 - 29:21.640:  very strong technical experience in over time. Perhaps the bigger scale challenge is ensuring
29:21.640 - 29:28.080:  there are safe secure areas with good habitat that can be maintained and financed for them
29:28.300 - 29:33.160:  into the future going forward so that this ends up being a success story with the rhino's
29:33.380 - 29:37.920:  happily released and breeding and growing numbers of the species into the future.
29:38.300 - 29:43.520:  I mean the clear concern must be that if you release large numbers of rhinos even over a
29:43.520 - 29:48.000:  quite a long period of time, like 10 years which is being suggested, they could be an easy target
29:48.000 - 29:53.960:  for poachers. How do you make sure that they're protected? This is one of the big questions to be
29:53.960 - 29:59.100:  addressed. How do we assess the site readiness of the different areas in which to put these rhino's?
29:59.100 - 30:05.260:  We know from experience, particularly with black rhinos of the kind of criteria we need to consider,
30:05.440 - 30:11.220:  ensuring that security is good enough, that land tenure is secured, that the habitat is good for
30:11.220 - 30:16.420:  the animals, communities in the area have brought in their strong political will at a national level,
30:16.920 - 30:22.260:  so there are a whole set of measures we already know about to consider. These would need to be
30:22.260 - 30:29.300:  revised and updated for these white rhino. And to what extent do you think within South Africa
30:29.660 - 30:34.320:  there is the will and the ability to do all of that? The majority of white rhinos in the
30:34.320 - 30:40.080:  world do remain in South Africa. I think to be successful, this is going to need not only to
30:40.080 - 30:45.580:  repopulate ultimately areas such as the greater Kruger landscape where rhinos have been lost in
30:45.580 - 30:52.320:  recent years, but also to move out into the region, so identifying sites potentially in Zimbabwe,
30:52.320 - 30:57.460:  in Zambia, even moving further north, there would need to be these very clear criteria that
30:57.460 - 31:02.680:  identify what would be the right kind of sites and ensuring that there is sufficient financing
31:02.700 - 31:07.960:  available to keep those sites secure into the future. One of the key lessons we've learned
31:07.960 - 31:14.580:  from black rhinos from South Africa, but also Kenya and Namibia, is that right now it's not
31:14.580 - 31:20.060:  actually that conservation is limited by the number of rhinos available, it's limited by the amount
31:20.060 - 31:25.580:  of suitable safe space to keep them in. And so we need to make sure those lessons are translated
31:25.580 - 31:29.400:  for the white rhino moves. Joe Shaw from the Conservation Group,
31:29.400 - 31:35.180:  Save the Rhino International. In folklore, Cuddly Christmas Nome is the beaded short
31:35.180 - 31:40.480:  statues popular in the festive period, said to give presents to children. But here in Britain,
31:40.480 - 31:46.380:  Welsh police are advising locals to be on the lookout after some of these knowns were left out
31:46.380 - 31:51.400:  in people's front gardens. And things might not be what they seem, David Lewis reports.
31:52.080 - 31:59.820:  The soft toys might seem cute, Christmasy, even Santa like, but they are potentially more sinister
31:59.820 - 32:05.360:  than they look. North Wales police are warning locals to be on the lookout for any Christmas
32:05.360 - 32:12.560:  nomes suddenly appearing in their front gardens in Flintshire. Glad tidings they do not bring.
32:13.120 - 32:18.580:  Officers say the figurines are possibly being left as calling cards. The strategy is simple.
32:18.960 - 32:24.120:  If the decoration is retrieved and removed, someone is in the house and keeping an eye out.
32:24.120 - 32:29.880:  If it's uncollected, the property is likely to be empty and therefore easier pickings for
32:29.880 - 32:35.660:  any would-be housebreakers in the lead up to the festive period. Not very Christmasy.
32:35.860 - 32:41.760:  The force have now released a photo of one such nome complete with red hat and bushy white beared
32:41.760 - 32:47.960:  as a warning. We are aware of a report of individuals in the broughton area leaving Christmas
32:47.960 - 32:52.180:  nomes in residential front gardens. A police statement said on Facebook,
32:52.180 - 32:57.120:  we would advise residents to be vigilant and ensure your home is secure.
32:57.860 - 33:04.220:  David Lewis. K-pop has grown from a Korean musical favorite to an international phenomenon.
33:04.840 - 33:09.180:  It has now estimated the industry earns the country around $10 billion a year.
33:10.080 - 33:15.600:  But it's not just bands like the famous BTS that are returning K-pop into a valuable export.
33:16.140 - 33:20.020:  The choreographers behind K-pop dances are quickly gaining a following
33:20.020 - 33:24.540:  well beyond Korea's borders too. Vivian Noonis has been finding out more.
33:28.560 - 33:34.460:  I'm in a gym at a university campus in London. This is where K-dance camp is happening all week.
33:35.060 - 33:39.900:  About 70 participants have flown in from across Europe to be here. They're paying about $1,300
33:41.000 - 33:43.440:  to learn from some of the most famous Korean choreographers.
33:46.860 - 33:49.360:  Hi, I'm Marlotte. I'm from the Netherlands.
33:50.040 - 33:54.400:  Hi, I'm Soline and I'm from Belgium. My name is Suzy and I'm also from the Netherlands.
33:57.020 - 34:02.720:  I've been a great K-pop fan for like two years now and I also really love dance.
34:02.820 - 34:09.240:  So I just saw this as like the biggest opportunity to really like learn and participate in
34:09.240 - 34:15.040:  these classes from these amazing choreographers and dancers. I really admire them and they
34:15.040 - 34:20.280:  inspire me to dance. So I thought that this was a crazy opportunity to actually get a class from
34:20.280 - 34:26.600:  them. It was a business opportunity spotted by Alex Lee. We have to bring a lot of people from
34:27.200 - 34:33.460:  South Korea. We are bringing eight dancers and also the K-pop company, our staff. It's not easy
34:33.900 - 34:39.900:  but we are trying our best. The five-day program includes dance classes, meals and accommodation.
34:39.900 - 34:46.240:  There's also the chance to audition for a K-pop dance company. We are going after London. We are
34:46.240 - 34:52.420:  going to Berlin to host the camp there and also we have our plans to host in Australia,
34:53.140 - 34:59.080:  US and other countries too. Among the most famous choreographers at the camp is Yeji Kim.
34:59.100 - 35:02.320:  She's part of the 1 million dance studio in Seoul.
35:07.560 - 35:11.740:  I feel very proud to be able to do this kind of thing. It's a great experience that I can't
35:11.740 - 35:16.500:  feel elsewhere. Going to new countries, meeting new people and sharing the choreography and
35:16.500 - 35:22.020:  sharing that energy with fellow dancers, it's very helpful for my future career. It's very valuable.
35:22.360 - 35:24.460:  SNS is very helpful to me.
35:51.980 - 35:56.440:  For your little wind, that's the thing that's happened in your life or where you live that's
35:56.440 - 36:01.360:  made your week, no matter how small. We've already had emails from listeners in Arizona, Florida
36:01.360 - 36:06.880:  and Australia and now one from Amanda Tunisian in South Africa who during a trip, well-watching,
36:07.100 - 36:12.960:  described seeing a great splash just off shore and suddenly the heart-shaped tale of a whale
36:12.960 - 36:18.440:  came sailing out of the water. For the first time in a long time I can remember I laughed and
36:18.440 - 36:23.460:  clapped out loud. Thanks very much for that Amanda. We'd love to hear all your stories so that we
36:23.460 - 36:28.840:  can include them in the podcast this weekend. Drop us an email with your little wind to global
