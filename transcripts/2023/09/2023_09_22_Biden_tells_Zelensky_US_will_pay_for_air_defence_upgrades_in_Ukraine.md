*01:44.900- 01:52.560* :  World Service. I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Friday the 22nd of September,
*01:52.560- 01:57.020* :  these are our main stories. After talks with President Biden at the White House,
*01:57.020- 02:02.900* :  President Zelensky has said the US has agreed extra help to strengthen Ukraine's air defenses
*02:02.900- 02:07.600* :  against further Russian attacks. The media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is giving his son,
*02:07.600- 02:13.500* :  Latlan, control of his businesses. And Brazil's Supreme Court has ruled in favour of restoring
*02:13.500- 02:21.700* :  territory to an indigenous group. Also in this podcast, how is this for the King's English?
*02:21.700- 02:30.780* :  To simply say, the Royal Money will always be one of the most powerful and best friends
*02:30.780- 02:33.820* :  of France. More details on that to come.
*02:37.840- 02:43.240* :  We begin though in Washington, DC. The US will give more help to Ukraine in the coming winter
*02:43.740- 02:48.380* :  to help boost its air defenses against Russian attacks. It's part of a package of measures
*02:48.380- 02:53.640* :  announced after talks between the US President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart for
*02:53.640- 02:59.000* :  Vladimir Zelensky at the White House. During a tour of Washington, Mr. Zelensky also visited
*02:59.000- 03:04.860* :  the US Congress and met leaders at Pentagon. It's all part of his continued diplomatic effort
*03:04.860- 03:09.820* :  to maintain American support for the war against Russia. At the end of the White House talks,
*03:09.820- 03:14.920* :  President Biden said the US remained committed to ensuring Ukraine's long-term security
*03:15.540- 03:18.500* :  and deterring future threats against sovereignty and freedom.
*03:36.020- 03:40.760* :  Well, I spoke to our North America correspondent Sean Dilly and asked him if Mr. Zelensky
*03:40.760- 03:45.660* :  has got what he wants. It's at the moment not setting stone robbing, of course, because the
*03:45.740- 03:53.780* :  $24 billion that Joe Biden has been floating is by no means secure. He now needs to secure
*03:53.780- 04:01.320* :  lawmakers on Capitol Hill that this is an investment they should make on top of just over $110
*04:01.320- 04:06.660* :  billion already over the past year and a half. What about the relationship between
*04:06.780- 04:13.020* :  Zelensky and Biden? Perhaps more importantly, those meetings on Capitol Hill, those political
*04:13.020- 04:17.860* :  leaders there and at the Pentagon. How's that side of the relationship with the US going?
*04:18.040- 04:22.880* :  It's pretty awkward, Robin. There's no other way of putting it. Political support is waning.
*04:22.880- 04:29.260* :  Republicans, in particular, argue that there is no US national security interest in continuing
*04:29.260- 04:36.500* :  to support Ukraine's defenses. Joe Biden has been pursuing a policy in office of strengthening
*04:36.500- 04:42.200* :  European leaders. He's a big supporter of NATO, for instance, the body that Donald Trump had
*04:42.200- 04:48.900* :  discussed withdrawing from the membership thereof. At the moment, Joe Biden does know that the $24
*04:48.900- 04:53.320* :  billion in additional aid that he would like to get through. Ultimately, when all is said and done
*04:53.700- 04:58.960* :  is likely to get through, but Republicans are not going to want to do that without some major
*04:59.340- 05:05.540* :  spending cuts in other areas. And the prospect of a domestic government shutdown in a renewed
*05:05.540- 05:13.420* :  row over US domestic budget, how's that going to influence the push from Zelensky for more funding
*05:13.420- 05:16.540* :  from the US? Is that going to make the environment even more challenging?
*05:16.860- 05:21.740* :  Yeah, it won't impact in any way, President Zelensky, asking for more funding. We heard him inside
*05:21.740- 05:27.120* :  the Oval Office just up the road from where I'm speaking to you from now, Robin, saying that particularly
*05:27.120- 05:34.360* :  in the area of their defenses, it desperately needs that support. It's rather challenging for Joe Biden.
*05:34.640- 05:39.360* :  He's now, through his colleagues in Congress, speaking to lawmakers on all sides of the House,
*05:39.460- 05:43.120* :  saying that it's very much in the US national interest, and it's the right thing to do.
*05:43.440- 05:44.940* :  Not every Republican agrees with him.
*05:45.420- 05:50.700* :  Sean Dilly in Washington, DC. Well, let's stay in the US, where Rupert Murdoch has announced that
*05:50.700- 05:56.160* :  he's stepping down from running one of the world's most powerful media empires at the age of 92.
*05:56.880- 06:02.560* :  He has demanded the ear of presidents and prime ministers along the way. Mr Murdoch is leaving his
*06:02.560- 06:09.260* :  role as chair of Fox and Newscore with his eldest son, Lacklin, taking over. Mr Murdoch started in
*06:09.260- 06:14.600* :  local newspapers in his native Australia and spent more than 70 years developing his own brand
*06:14.600- 06:20.940* :  of right-wing populist content. It gave him significant political influence, particularly in the US
*06:20.940- 06:27.020* :  and Britain. On Thursday, the 92-year-old announced in a letter to staff that he had decided to transition
*06:27.620- 06:33.200* :  from being chairman of Fox and Newscore. His words, of part of the letter, are voiced by a BBC
*06:33.200- 06:39.120* :  producer. Dear colleagues, I'm writing to let you all know that I've decided to transition to the
*06:39.120- 06:45.180* :  role of chairman emeritus at Fox and News. For my entire professional life, I've been engaged
*06:45.180- 06:50.640* :  daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on
*06:50.640- 06:56.160* :  different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams and a passionate principal leader in
*06:56.160- 07:02.380* :  Lacklin, who will become sole chairman of both companies. Rupert Murdoch was frequently accused of
*07:02.380- 07:08.120* :  misusing the power that his news outlets gave him. Speaking to the BBC, back in the 1960s,
*07:08.540- 07:12.020* :  he described the feeling of power he got from being a newspaper owner.
*07:12.620- 07:18.120* :  The first one enjoys the feeling of power. Although, I think it's a creation of a power
*07:18.120- 07:23.100* :  newspaper for writers can be greatly overdone. We have more responsibility than power, I think. The
*07:23.100- 07:29.800* :  news paper can create great controversies, stir up arguments within the community discussion,
*07:30.520- 07:37.420* :  can throw light on injustices, just as a community opposite, can hide things, and be a great
*07:37.420- 07:42.540* :  path or evil. The British journalist and broadcaster Piers Morgan was in charge of the
*07:42.540- 07:46.840* :  news of the world here in the UK. That's one of Rupert Murdoch's most influential newspapers
*07:46.840- 07:51.040* :  before it was shut down over a phone hacking scandal back in 2011.
*07:51.620- 07:57.780* :  To me, Rupert Murdoch is the greatest media figure of my lifetime, possibly ever,
*07:58.300- 08:02.700* :  in terms of his boldness, his vision, in terms of his reach around the world.
*08:03.500- 08:08.020* :  And for me personally, the opportunity he gave me when he made me editor of his
*08:08.360- 08:14.660* :  biggest selling newspaper in the world, age 28, was an unbelievable opportunity.
*08:14.660- 08:20.740* :  Brian Stelter from the US magazine Vanity Fair has written extensively about Rupert Murdoch's
*08:20.740- 08:26.840* :  controversial Fox News. In some ways, this was inevitable. And yes, Rupert Murdoch always said
*08:26.840- 08:31.540* :  he would never retire. His son Lachlan always said his dad would never retire.
*08:31.540- 08:37.540* :  But his companies have been shrinking over the years and struggling against the media headwinds
*08:37.840- 08:41.940* :  that all media companies are facing, for example, streaming and the struggles of newspapers.
*08:41.940- 08:48.520* :  So Rupert Murdoch is not the swashbuckling feared and reviled media mogul that he once was,
*08:48.520- 08:52.760* :  that he was for decades. Well, that's the thoughts of Brian Stelter and before him,
*08:52.760- 08:57.540* :  Piers Morgan. I spoke to our business correspondent Erring Delmore, who's in New York City,
*08:58.120- 09:00.860* :  and they asked her how the Murdoch News there has been received.
*09:01.660- 09:06.220* :  Whether or not you love him, there's been no denying over here that Rupert Murdoch is a defining
*09:06.220- 09:12.820* :  influence on the US media landscape. And in fact, has done more than many individuals to shape
*09:12.820- 09:17.600* :  public opinion, especially on the right. The network where his news network Fox has found
*09:17.600- 09:22.320* :  a political home. You know, there's been a lot of different talk today about what this means
*09:22.320- 09:26.680* :  for the company and what's ahead. But in this moment, a lot of people are looking back on Murdoch's
*09:26.680- 09:31.240* :  legacy and the way that he has shaped the way that news operates in the United States. Certainly,
*09:31.240- 09:37.680* :  it's not so much a wild change for Fox itself with Lachlan having had his hands on the wheel for
*09:37.680- 09:41.560* :  a bit of time now. But it's just a moment to reflect on Murdoch's legacy as a whole.
*09:41.880- 09:46.420* :  Is he going to go quietly as part of this transition? Or do you expect to hear from Rupert Murdoch
*09:46.420- 09:49.940* :  in the weeks, months and years ahead? No, he made it known in the statement that he would be
*09:49.940- 09:55.540* :  continuing to speak up made a point to say that he's always taken a role in daily editorial,
*09:55.540- 10:00.700* :  you know, the news happenings of the day. And that seems to be almost in his DNA at this point.
*10:00.740- 10:05.200* :  It's hard to say how far this is a step back or a step out or what kind of influence he'll still
*10:05.200- 10:08.960* :  exert. But he's been out and about and he's been reassuring folks that he's still going to be,
*10:09.260- 10:12.740* :  you know, a visible presence here. Now we said at the beginning that along the way to
*10:13.260- 10:18.240* :  constructing this huge empire, he's demanded the ares of presidents and prime ministers.
*10:18.240- 10:22.180* :  Has there been any reaction from President Trump or others? Are there other senior politicians
*10:22.180- 10:26.900* :  on the news? We're looking to see now. And part of what strikes me about the moment and the timing
*10:26.900- 10:30.500* :  here is that we're about to get into a brand new political cycle here in the United States.
*10:30.900- 10:35.560* :  And so certainly, yes, we can talk about the way that Rupert Murdoch's news organizations have
*10:35.780- 10:40.320* :  amplified and elevated former president Trump's standing within the Republican Party,
*10:40.320- 10:44.660* :  again, someone who had been previously untested in politics, tested in the business world,
*10:44.660- 10:51.100* :  but new to government and governance and how much Fox News' coverage of him and endorsement
*10:51.100- 10:57.060* :  and embrace of his policies and his message really fueled his base in 2016 and also in 2020.
*10:57.060- 11:02.000* :  And the network has found itself in broiled and litigation, even paying out a $787 million
*11:02.000- 11:07.480* :  settlement over its amplifications of the false claims made by President Trump about the 2020
*11:07.980- 11:14.120* :  election. Aaron Delmore reporting. Sudan's de facto leader, General Abda Fata Al-Baran,
*11:14.120- 11:19.440* :  has told the United Nations General Assembly that war in his country could spill over into
*11:19.440- 11:24.480* :  neighboring African nations. He urged the international community to designate his opponents,
*11:24.480- 11:30.240* :  the rapid support forces, as a terrorist group. From New York, our diplomatic correspondent James
*11:30.240- 11:35.440* :  Landel reports. Thousands of Sudanese civilians have died in the fighting between the rapid
*11:35.440- 11:40.400* :  support force rebels and the Sudanese armed forces. Its leader, General Al-Baran,
*11:40.400- 11:46.180* :  is on a diplomatic tour seeking international support. He warned the UN the conflict was now a
*11:46.180- 11:52.300* :  threat to regional peace and stability. He also accused the RSF of war crimes, and he claimed he
*11:52.300- 11:57.980* :  was willing to engage in peace talks. In a rare video appearance, the RSF leader, Mohammed
*11:57.980- 12:04.320* :  Handan Daiglo, also known as Hamedi, said he too was prepared for a ceasefire. Similar statements
*12:04.320- 12:08.620* :  by both sides have previously not led to any reduction in the fighting.
*12:09.240- 12:11.200* :  James Landel. Let's go to Brazil now.
*12:16.680- 12:22.240* :  That was the reaction on Thursday to a ruling from Brazil's supreme courts about restoring land
*12:22.240- 12:27.220* :  to an indigenous group in the country. The decision in favor of the Shokling people will
*12:27.220- 12:33.580* :  set a precedent for hundreds of land claims. It's likely to define the future of land rights in South
*12:33.580- 12:37.100* :  America's largest country. Katie Watson in Sao Paulo told me more.
*12:37.860- 12:42.940* :  Well, this is a longstanding case for the indigenous people of the Shokling. So they are about
*12:42.940- 12:49.220* :  there about 2,300 people who live in Santa Catarina, which is in the state of southern Brazil.
*12:49.220- 12:55.520* :  Their troubles have been going on since the 19th and 20th centuries. They were victims of a
*12:55.520- 13:01.860* :  really brutal land clearance. Many German settlers who came in and drove them off their land.
*13:01.860- 13:07.920* :  So back in 1996, they were granted the rights to some land, but they argued that actually they
*13:07.920- 13:12.540* :  would do much more because they actually had much more ancestral lands before they were driven
*13:13.100- 13:17.560* :  from them, they were taken from them by force. Then it goes on to 2009 when they were
*13:17.720- 13:22.220* :  evicted from an area that formed a nature reserve. They appealed this decision.
*13:22.780- 13:27.800* :  And then in 2013, the authorities used this argument that's called the Marco Temporal,
*13:27.800- 13:32.860* :  which means timeframe in Portuguese. And effectively, the argument was that if the
*13:32.860- 13:37.320* :  indigenous people wanted to lay claim to any land, they would have proved they live on that land
*13:37.320- 13:44.320* :  when the Brazilian Constitution was signed in 1988. But they argued that completely ignored the
*13:44.320- 13:49.180* :  fact that they'd been forcibly removed to make way for the settlers. So that's why they took
*13:49.180- 13:54.240* :  their appeal all the way to the Supreme Court. And am I right that in terms of this particular case,
*13:54.240- 13:58.620* :  it pitted this indigenous group against the industrial farming complex, is that right?
*13:58.800- 14:03.880* :  I mean, it's the story of Brazil and its land, yes. So there are a lot of indigenous groups
*14:03.880- 14:09.240* :  on land that is very, you know, seems very valuable. We hear about deforestation of the Amazon
*14:09.240- 14:14.300* :  all the time. That's exactly the same issue. The powerful farming lobbies in Brazil were pitted
*14:14.300- 14:19.980* :  against indigenous communities, which is something that you often see. And there are a huge amount
*14:19.980- 14:26.000* :  of court cases and conflicts over land rights. And that's what's so interesting about this case,
*14:26.000- 14:31.700* :  is because the fact that now this so-called time frame Marco Temporal has been swept away,
*14:31.700- 14:38.260* :  it now could open up so many more cases. So this is seen and this is regarded as a defining moment
*14:38.260- 14:43.320* :  is it in terms of it setting a precedent going forward? Absolutely. I mean, it's seen as a boost
*14:43.320- 14:49.580* :  to indigenous rights. Of course, now the president is Lula de Silva. He made very clear in his
*14:49.580- 14:54.320* :  campaign and he's made clear in his, you know, previous time as president, that the rights of
*14:54.320- 14:59.220* :  indigenous people, the rights of, you know, land rights are something that he feels very important.
*14:59.220- 15:04.720* :  You compare that with far-right leader, Jai Bolsonaro, who talked about the fact that indigenous
*15:04.720- 15:09.440* :  rights have gone too far. He said he wouldn't give an inch more to indigenous communities. He's
*15:09.440- 15:14.260* :  already had enough land. So it's a very different political, you know, landscape in Brazil. And of
*15:14.260- 15:20.260* :  course, this is a huge, you know, win for indigenous communities who are often seen as lacking
*15:20.260- 15:24.900* :  the ability really to be able to fight their corner when you've got powerful farming lobbies
*15:25.200- 15:28.940* :  arguing that they shouldn't be evicted from the land that they've worked for decades either.
*15:29.380- 15:35.080* :  Katie Watson in Sao Paulo. A BBC investigation has revealed that the social media app TikTok
*15:35.080- 15:40.260* :  is driving online frenzes that encourage anti-social behaviour in the real world.
*15:40.940- 15:45.760* :  Ex-employees of TikTok say the issue is not being tackled for fear of slowing the growth of
*15:45.760- 15:52.260* :  the business. These frenzes where TikTok drives disproportionate engagement in some topics are
*15:52.260- 15:58.120* :  evidenced by interviews with former staffers, app users, and BBC analysis of wider social media
*15:58.120- 16:04.240* :  data. They've led to disruption and disorder in everyday life. The BBC's Mariana Spring has more.
*16:05.140- 16:09.200* :  Like everybody else in TikTok, I'm obsessed with this Idaho murder case.
*16:09.580- 16:12.100* :  What connects false accusations of murder in the US?
*16:12.100- 16:15.000* :  Where four students were brutally stabbed to death.
*16:15.220- 16:20.860* :  Amateur sleuths turning up in a British town and anti-social behaviour and vandalism in UK schools.
*16:21.660- 16:25.860* :  The answer is they are all examples of TikTok frenzies identified by the BBC.
*16:26.440- 16:29.880* :  When you post a video on TikTok, it can be pushed to users everywhere on the full
*16:29.880- 16:33.880* :  you page at a speed and scale that doesn't seem possible on other social media platforms,
*16:34.620- 16:39.400* :  creating a frenzy of posts. Former employees and creators have told me how this
*16:39.400- 16:42.520* :  design means people are seeing videos they normally would not see,
*16:42.520- 16:47.160* :  and being incentivised to behave in a harmful way to produce more popular content.
*16:47.740- 16:52.500* :  The search for mum of two Nicola Bully continues eight days after she went missing.
*16:52.500- 16:55.720* :  Nicola Bully's disappearance earlier this year shocked the UK.
*16:56.400- 16:59.660* :  An inquest ruled the 45-year-old died by accidental drowning,
*16:59.660- 17:05.100* :  but conspiracy theories exploded on TikTok, with police saying it interfered with the investigation.
*17:05.800- 17:07.680* :  Hello. Hi. Lovely to meet you.
*17:07.760- 17:11.600* :  I travelled to Swansea to meet Heather. She ran one account racking up millions of views
*17:11.600- 17:15.580* :  posting about the case, having never shared content like this on TikTok before.
*17:16.260- 17:20.440* :  In one video, she falsely suggested footage of Nicola leaving the house on the morning of her
*17:20.440- 17:25.200* :  disappearance was really her friend Emma. It received 3.6 million views.
*17:25.700- 17:31.060* :  Whenever you post something on a game's traction TikTok will send you little emails of encouragement
*17:31.060- 17:34.220* :  telling you that you've received this many views, you're a hit.
*17:34.620- 17:38.700* :  If you post something and you receive a lot of positivity from it,
*17:38.700- 17:43.340* :  I think that can definitely change your behaviour, whereas before you might not have had that level of
*17:43.600- 17:49.460* :  empowerment or entitlement and all of a sudden you feel that you've got this authority to keep posting.
*17:49.820- 17:52.700* :  Heather regretted getting caught up in the frenzy, and without TikTok,
*17:52.700- 17:55.040* :  she doesn't think she would have got involved in this way.
*17:55.520- 18:00.200* :  Lucas, not his real name, is one of several TikTok ex-employees I spoke to for answers
*18:00.200- 18:02.980* :  about these frenzies, who's voiced by an actor.
*18:03.380- 18:07.460* :  They grew so fast that they couldn't possibly keep up, with or predicted every single
*18:07.460- 18:11.820* :  way the app was going to go, and in general they don't want to. They don't want to stand in a way
*18:11.820- 18:16.960* :  of entertainment growing quickly on their platform. It's about money. The more users they have on
*18:16.960- 18:22.400* :  the platform, spending more time watching videos, they can sell more ads, sell them for a higher price.
*18:22.980- 18:27.100* :  It's probably the most addictive platform that we've encountered yet, and I think that's a real
*18:27.100- 18:32.040* :  danger, especially because of how young the audience is and how impressionable they are.
*18:32.380- 18:36.980* :  TikTok told the BBC, our platform reflects conversations happening up and down the country and
*18:36.980- 18:41.820* :  in the media. Our recommendation system is designed to prioritize safety, suggesting a range of
*18:41.820- 18:46.520* :  content to proactively interrupting repetitive patterns and reducing the reach of videos containing
*18:46.520- 18:52.260* :  unverified information. Speaking to ex-employees and users, it seems that these frenzies are difficult
*18:52.260- 18:55.840* :  to keep up with, and it's hard to know when and where the next one will happen.
*18:56.560- 19:00.960* :  That report from the BBC's disinformation and social media correspondent, Mariana Spring.
*19:04.380- 19:08.680* :  Still to come? There's nothing like 100 percent pure Florida quality orange
*19:08.680- 19:12.380* :  juice, with the vitamins, minerals and taste that make you feel so good.
*19:12.960- 19:16.720* :  But why has the cost of orange juice in many parts of the world been increasing?

*20:36.960- 20:41.460* :  I had just come out of one of my bare-knuckle boxing matches. I don't know why,
*20:41.460- 20:45.160* :  but the first thing that came to my brain was, what if I do a drag show?
*20:45.380- 20:50.760* :  Remarkable personal stories told by the people that lived them. I could easily have pulled that
*20:50.760- 20:57.160* :  trigger, but that was not my brief. I was not an assassin. I was not told to do that. I was not told
*20:57.160- 21:03.220* :  to murder him. Live's less ordinary, from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get your BBC
*21:03.220- 21:10.820* :  podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
*21:10.820- 21:16.420* :  has urged India to cooperate with an investigation into the murder of a Canadian seek activist.
*21:16.420- 21:21.100* :  His claim earlier this week that the Indian government may have been involved in the killing
*21:21.100- 21:26.060* :  on Canadian soil has triggered a furious diplomatic row between the two countries.
*21:26.680- 21:30.720* :  On Thursday, Mr Trudeau insisted that he wasn't seeking to provoke Delhi.
*21:31.420- 21:36.960* :  India, though, has halted visa services in Canada and called for a reduction in Canadian diplomatic
*21:36.960- 21:43.420* :  staff based in India. Mr Trudeau said the killing in June of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil
*21:43.420- 21:51.380* :  was of the utmost seriousness. We call upon the government of India to take seriously this matter
*21:51.940- 22:00.240* :  and to work with us to shed full transparency and ensure accountability and justice in this matter.
*22:00.820- 22:06.560* :  We are country of the rule of law. We are going to continue to do the work necessary to keep
*22:06.560- 22:11.820* :  Canadians safe and to uphold our values and the international rules-based order.
*22:12.640- 22:15.260* :  I heard more from our correspondent in Delhi, Zubair Ahmed.
*22:16.260- 22:22.340* :  The relations between two democracies and two friends were tense earlier, but now it seems
*22:22.340- 22:29.220* :  like it's standing out into a full-blown diplomatic crisis. In the afternoon here,
*22:29.220- 22:34.920* :  the Indian government said that it wanted Canada to downsize its diplomatic core in India,
*22:34.920- 22:42.420* :  citing alleged interference by Canadian diplomats in what they said India's internal affairs.
*22:42.920- 22:46.980* :  It also said that the Canadian diplomats in India were much larger in number.
*22:47.400- 22:53.440* :  What they want is parity in numbers and also in ranks and that's why we will see in the next
*22:53.440- 23:00.460* :  couple of days lots of Canadian diplomats leaving India. Are there signs in the media coverage there
*23:00.460- 23:07.020* :  over the past few days that India regards this as something very, very serious or what's the
*23:07.020- 23:14.460* :  talk bin where you are about these accusations? Well, India is feeling quite upset and even angry.
*23:14.700- 23:21.300* :  Many Indians, especially the former diplomats who are coming on Indian channels and Indian newspapers,
*23:22.040- 23:28.580* :  they're all very upset that the Canadian Prime Minister will go public with his accusation
*23:28.580- 23:35.280* :  that India was behind the killing of a Sikh Canadian citizen in the month of June this year.
*23:35.660- 23:42.080* :  The feeling here is that India is not going to back down. I just spoke to a governing BJP
*23:42.080- 23:49.820* :  ruling party member when he said that the instructions are that we have to be very strong and we have
*23:49.900- 23:55.620* :  to give Canada back in its own coins. You referred to some former diplomats you say they're upset.
*23:55.620- 24:00.400* :  Are they upset because they don't believe the accusation made by Justin Trudeau or they
*24:00.400- 24:06.400* :  upset because he's chosen to make it public? It's both. Many of the ruling party ex diplomats who
*24:06.400- 24:11.440* :  have joined the party now they say that the accusations are untrue but there are some who
*24:11.440- 24:18.160* :  believe that it was right for Mr. Trudeau when he came to attend the G20 summit in Delhi to
*24:18.720- 24:25.960* :  fight in Mr. Modi and I complained to him in private which he did and he should not have gone
*24:25.960- 24:32.960* :  public with his accusations. Zubeh Ahmed speaking to me from Delhi. The BBC is facing fresh
*24:32.960- 24:38.420* :  allegations about the conduct of the British comedian and actor Russell Brand. A woman has come
*24:38.420- 24:44.160* :  forward to accuse him of exposing himself to her and then joking about it on his BBC radio show.
*24:44.680- 24:49.800* :  Russell Brand has denied recent accusations of rape and sexual assault from four women
*24:49.800- 24:57.020* :  between 2006 and 2013. He has yet though to respond to these new claims. The BBC has said it's
*24:57.020- 25:02.440* :  very sorry to hear of the allegations and we'll look into them. From Los Angeles here's our North
*25:02.440- 25:07.920* :  America correspondent Nomiya Ikbal and a warning her report contains some graphic details.
*25:09.080- 25:14.100* :  The woman who has made the complaint had never come forward before but was prompted to speak out
*25:14.100- 25:18.740* :  when the allegations about Russell Brand emerged at the weekend. She says the incident happened
*25:18.740- 25:23.380* :  when the comedian and broadcaster was in the BBC's office in Los Angeles to record his radio
*25:23.380- 25:28.800* :  to show in 2008. She was working for another company which shared the office space and had
*25:28.800- 25:33.700* :  opened the front door to him and his team after the doorbell kept ringing unanswered.
*25:34.280- 25:38.480* :  Sometime later she was in a communal bathroom when she says Russell Brand entered the room
*25:38.480- 25:43.020* :  and exposed himself to her. We've asked an actor to speak her words.
*25:43.320- 25:50.700* :  And then he said, well, I'm going to f*** you and I went what? And he goes, I'm going to f*** you.
*25:51.260- 25:58.000* :  And he said, no, you're not. He was wearing black iron pants which are pants that have
*25:58.180- 26:05.300* :  an elasticized waist and he pulled out his penis on his hand and pretty much served it to me and
*26:05.300- 26:11.860* :  he would be serving someone some food. The woman said his team then banged on the door
*26:11.860- 26:17.380* :  and he went out to record his show. She said she was left feeling ashamed but didn't make a
*26:17.380- 26:23.780* :  formal complaint despite many people knowing what had happened. However, in recent days she heard
*26:23.780- 26:30.240* :  the broadcast for the first time when Russell Brand and his co-host Matt Morgan had gone on to laugh
*26:30.240- 26:35.860* :  about the incident. Moments after she says it happened. I won't be able to drag her off into a
*26:35.860- 26:41.960* :  cubicle and show her my cubicles and would never do that last. Been a long while, Matt, since I was
*26:41.960- 26:49.060* :  rassy. Wait, two five minutes since he showed his willy to a lady. Very easy to judge, very easy to
*26:49.060- 26:56.320* :  to receptionist. Look, if you were like... Receive this! Am I supposed to ring that little bell
*26:56.320- 27:00.800* :  with my finger? Have you got told off the ring in a bell? Minutes later, he was showing his willy.
*27:01.160- 27:06.540* :  The woman who was not in fact a receptionist but did work in the shared office says she stunned
*27:06.540- 27:12.460* :  this exchange was broadcast. What made the BBC think that was appropriate to go out like that?
*27:13.020- 27:17.080* :  I just don't understand why they didn't investigate this much sooner given the raunchy
*27:17.080- 27:24.900* :  outrageous bits that I have heard and I suspect his of his radio show and I suspect there's far
*27:24.900- 27:32.300* :  worse in all those episodes that I can't even stomach to listen to them. She said nobody from
*27:32.300- 27:38.560* :  BBC News Management approached her directly and no formal action was taken. Even after a BBC staff
*27:38.560- 27:45.820* :  member had disclosed the incident to senior executives in 2019. Nomi Igbal in Los Angeles and we've
*27:45.860- 27:50.560* :  since had a statement from Russell Brand's former co-presenter Matt Morgan who you heard in that
*27:50.560- 27:56.160* :  clip from a radio show. In the statement he said, I stopped working with Russell Brand several
*27:56.160- 28:01.380* :  years ago. During the time I worked with him I was never aware of any allegations of serious
*28:01.380- 28:07.120* :  sexual misconduct against him. I am regretful to learn that a show I was part of made colleagues
*28:07.120- 28:13.300* :  uncomfortable at times. And you can see more of that statement and this story at BBC News Online.
*28:14.320- 28:18.920* :  You're listening to the Global News podcast. Now let's go to France and the visit of a very
*28:18.920- 28:33.680* :  famous Englishman and his address to the French Parliament. That was you've guessed it,
*28:33.680- 28:38.480* :  King Charles on the second day of his state visit in which he said that I'm translating
*28:38.480- 28:43.180* :  here for you. Quite simply the United Kingdom will always be one of France's closest allies
*28:43.180- 28:48.840* :  and best friends. Well the King and his wife Queen Camilla have also viewed reconstruction work
*28:48.840- 28:56.220* :  at Notre Dame Cathedral. Hugh Schofield sent this report from Paris. Before even he'd begun speaking
*28:56.220- 29:01.120* :  the King was honoured with applause from the parliamentarians gathered in your Nate Senate chamber
*29:01.120- 29:06.740* :  inside the 17th century Palais de Luxembourg. It was the first time in history that a British monarch
*29:06.740- 29:11.620* :  had given a speech in either of the chambers of the French Parliament. Combining sections in
*29:11.620- 29:16.600* :  French with sections in English the King spoke of his devotion to France inherited from his mother
*29:16.600- 29:22.640* :  and pledged to use his reign to work to reinforce what he called our indispensable relationship.
*29:22.640- 29:29.260* :  On Ukraine and the environment it was vital he said that France and the UK worked hand in hand.
*29:29.540- 29:36.420* :  These horrifying events have once more demonstrated the fragility of so much that we hold dear.
*29:37.180- 29:44.360* :  Just as we stand together against military aggression so must we strive together to protect the
*29:44.360- 29:51.480* :  world from our most existential challenge of all. That of global warming, climate change,
*29:51.480- 29:57.600* :  and the catastrophic destruction of nature. There was another standing evasion at the end.
*29:58.120- 30:01.680* :  Later the King and Queen met sports people in the suburb of Sandinite.
*30:05.420- 30:09.360* :  And at Notre Dame they met firefighters who were at the blaze that ravaged the cathedral
*30:09.360- 30:13.540* :  four years ago and craftsmen and women who were helping in the reconstruction.
*30:16.360- 30:20.820* :  The King and Queen flight of Bordeaux in the southwest for the last leg of their state visit.
*30:21.420- 30:26.940* :  Husco filled in Paris. Now let's end on a glass of orange juice. It's a staple of every breakfast
*30:27.260- 30:32.640* :  but recently the cost of a glass has gone up because crop sizes have gone down. Both
*30:32.640- 30:38.220* :  Brazil, the world's largest orange supplier and the US state of Florida which accounts for more
*30:38.220- 30:42.280* :  than 90 percent of the country's supply, have been dealing with extreme weather events.
*30:42.280- 30:47.100* :  There was hurricane Ian at the end of last summer then there was cold weather over the winter
*30:47.520- 30:53.040* :  which has made it more difficult to grow the fruit. It sent so-called futures prices for orange juice
*30:53.040- 30:58.960* :  to record highs as Alex Bell has been finding out. There's nothing like 100 percent pure
*30:58.960- 31:04.020* :  Florida quality orange juice with the vitamins minerals and taste that make you feel so good.
*31:04.380- 31:10.780* :  A television advertisement from the 1990s promoting the feel good factor that comes from Florida's
*31:10.780- 31:17.220* :  most famous fruit. Orange's are so beloved here that they're even featured on car license plates
*31:17.220- 31:23.540* :  but 30 years since that commercial ed and growers aren't feeling so good about what lies ahead.
*31:23.540- 31:30.680* :  Florida has a lot of weather conditions that we have to combat, not only hurricanes but also
*31:30.680- 31:37.920* :  freezes, droughts, excessive rain. Kyle's storied family has been farming citrus fruits for
*31:37.920- 31:44.460* :  generations across hectares of land spread right across Florida. In 2022 their farms were hit
*31:44.460- 31:48.940* :  by devastating hurricanes and now there's another growing threat to contend with
*31:49.340- 31:58.700* :  a nasty bacterial disease known as greening. We see citrus greeting across all growing areas in
*31:58.700- 32:05.640* :  Florida. It's a disease that affects each and every tree unlike any other disease we've ever
*32:05.640- 32:13.420* :  witnessed certainly in my lifetime. It infects any type of variety whether that be oranges or
*32:13.420- 32:21.780* :  grapefruit, lime, lemons and in the last two to three years it has taken its toll. Not only
*32:21.780- 32:30.740* :  I have our inputs, our costs gone up over double and in some cases triple our production has gone
*32:30.740- 32:40.320* :  down and quite frankly after the hurricanes of 2022 we saw our production hit historical lows.
*32:41.180- 32:46.020* :  But away from the farmlands a financial phenomenon has been engulfing the orange juice industry
*32:46.180- 32:53.640* :  and it all sounds a little familiar. We are commodities brokers with him, commodities are agricultural
*32:53.640- 33:00.440* :  products. In the 1983 film Trading Places Eddie Murphy finds himself swept up in the world of
*33:00.440- 33:06.940* :  futures trading making big books short selling frozen orange juice concentrate, orange juice itself
*33:06.940- 33:12.320* :  portrayed in the film as an American symbol of wealth and opportunity and it's a story ringing
*33:12.320- 33:18.540* :  true today because the problems facing farmers like Kyle have sent orange juice futures to an all-time
*33:18.540- 33:25.580* :  high over summer. I spoke to Matt Joyner CEO of Florida Citrus Mutual, a trade association which
*33:25.580- 33:32.320* :  works with citrus farmers. The futures market is a pricing mechanism that's forward looking on what
*33:32.320- 33:38.940* :  we think the value of FCOJ of frozen concentrate orange juice will be in the future and they're
*33:38.940- 33:44.680* :  used to hedge pricing on your crops and of course my traders just for general trading.
*33:44.940- 33:50.400* :  And so why are futures a hot topic right now? The reason there's so much discussion around the
*33:50.400- 33:55.800* :  futures market right now is because the future price or the projected price of orange juice
*33:56.160- 34:02.120* :  is going up and we're seeing that because we're seeing a decrease in the production of oranges
*34:03.040- 34:10.740* :  over the past 18 years from about 250 million boxes of oranges down to roughly
*34:11.660- 34:16.980* :  16 million boxes this past season and so when you're seeing that kind of a decrease in volume
*34:16.980- 34:23.680* :  obviously the price of that commodity is going to go up. So is this as is often the case a chance
*34:23.680- 34:30.160* :  for savvy market traders to cash in on a difficult time for thousands of farmers? Well not exactly
*34:30.840- 34:35.100* :  many are banking on the humble orange to make a comeback including farmer Kyle.
*34:35.580- 34:42.940* :  As a farmer I have to be a natural optimist. As a business person I have to be realistic.
*34:44.000- 34:53.320* :  We no doubt have unprecedented challenges facing us today but what we see with new therapies that
