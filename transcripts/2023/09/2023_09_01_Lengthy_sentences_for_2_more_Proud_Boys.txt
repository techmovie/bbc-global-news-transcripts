01:39.500 - 01:42.040:  and areas of mainland China take shelter
01:42.440 - 01:43.740:  against a super typhoon.
01:44.240 - 01:46.460:  And Muhammad al-Fair, the Egyptian businessman

01:56.340 - 01:58.880:  who made his fortune during the Nazi era.
01:59.380 - 02:01.360:  And in Mexico, goodness gracious,
02:01.660 - 02:03.160:  great balls of cheese.
02:03.440 - 02:06.260:  For us and for our cattle producers in this region,
02:06.660 - 02:08.540:  it is going to be a part of history
02:09.640 - 02:12.380:  to have the biggest piece of cheese in the world.
02:15.260 - 02:16.980:  Now staunch supporters of Donald Trump,
02:16.980 - 02:19.340:  the far-right group known as the proud boys
02:19.340 - 02:21.440:  were among the first to storm the US Capitol
02:21.780 - 02:23.500:  just after the 2020 election.
02:24.040 - 02:25.860:  Three of its members have already been given
02:25.860 - 02:28.160:  long prison sentences for their involvement.
02:28.660 - 02:30.800:  A fourth proud boy has just been jailed
02:30.800 - 02:33.160:  for 18 years, the longest sentence yet.
02:33.760 - 02:36.240:  And North America editor Sarah Smith is in Washington.
02:36.840 - 02:39.700:  There's probably about 300 proud boys.
02:40.000 - 02:40.580:  They're marching.
02:40.960 - 02:42.520:  Those is the people marched on the Capitol
02:42.520 - 02:44.240:  on the 6th of January 2021.
02:45.160 - 02:46.620:  The violence that followed has already
02:46.620 - 02:48.040:  led to hundreds of convictions
02:48.500 - 02:50.400:  with the longest sentences going to the people
02:50.400 - 02:52.500:  who organized and coordinated their riot.
02:53.620 - 02:55.860:  The neo-fascist proud boys saw themselves
02:55.860 - 02:57.600:  as Donald Trump's foot soldiers
02:58.000 - 03:00.280:  prepared to use force to stop Joe Biden
03:00.280 - 03:01.700:  being certified as president.
03:02.860 - 03:04.820:  Ethan Nordin and Joseph Biggs
03:04.820 - 03:06.560:  took charge of the proud boys on that day,
03:07.200 - 03:09.500:  using a radio to coordinate and move their men.
03:10.240 - 03:12.780:  They've both been convicted of seditious conspiracy.
03:13.940 - 03:14.880:  We know about this.
03:16.380 - 03:18.720:  Nordin has received one of the longest sentences
03:18.720 - 03:22.520:  related to the January 6th riots, 18 years in prison.
03:22.520 - 03:25.500:  We love Trump! We love Trump!
03:25.720 - 03:27.720:  Donald Trump had invited his supporters
03:27.720 - 03:30.200:  to come to Washington and to march towards Congress,
03:30.760 - 03:32.040:  using language many believe
03:32.440 - 03:33.800:  encourage the violence that followed.
03:33.800 - 03:36.200:  We fight. We fight like hell.
03:36.500 - 03:37.900:  And if you don't fight like hell,
03:37.900 - 03:39.720:  you're not going to have a country anymore.
03:40.200 - 03:41.980:  Joseph Biggs sobbed in court
03:42.040 - 03:44.240:  and begged for leniency before he was sentenced
03:44.240 - 03:45.740:  to 17 years in jail.
03:46.340 - 03:48.060:  His lawyer blames the former president.
03:48.560 - 03:49.960:  Where's Donald Trump and all of this?
03:50.320 - 03:52.580:  He stood on the ellipse, basically told people
03:53.120 - 03:54.540:  74 million of his followers.
03:55.260 - 03:57.580:  The election stolen, go to the Capitol,
03:57.580 - 03:59.400:  fight like hell, you won't have a country anymore.
03:59.400 - 04:00.700:  Some people listen to him.
04:00.860 - 04:03.180:  Dominic Tazola can be clearly seen smashing
04:03.180 - 04:04.380:  a window in Congress,
04:04.380 - 04:06.720:  which then ignited the invasion of the building.
04:07.600 - 04:09.640:  He's been sentenced to 10 years in prison.
04:10.460 - 04:11.620:  In a debate with Joe Biden,
04:11.680 - 04:13.400:  before the 2020 election,
04:13.600 - 04:15.980:  Donald Trump refused to condemn racist violence
04:16.520 - 04:17.820:  and namechecked the problem.
04:17.820 - 04:18.180:  I promise.
04:19.260 - 04:20.900:  Stand back and stand by.
04:21.880 - 04:23.980:  The proud boys leader, Enrique Tario,
04:23.980 - 04:25.280:  will be sentenced next week.
04:25.980 - 04:29.120:  Donald Trump himself is facing a criminal trial next year
04:29.120 - 04:30.980:  over his actions to try to overturn
04:30.980 - 04:32.640:  the 2020 election result.
04:32.960 - 04:33.760:  If he's convicted,
04:34.140 - 04:36.580:  he also could be facing in lengthy jail sentence.
04:37.080 - 04:38.400:  Sarah Smith in Washington.
04:38.920 - 04:41.240:  Hong Kong has issued its highest storm alert
04:41.420 - 04:42.900:  for super typhoon salad.
04:47.360 - 04:49.720:  The authorities are warning it could be the strongest storm
04:49.720 - 04:51.200:  to hit the area in decades
04:51.200 - 04:54.460:  with winds of up to 175 kilometers an hour.
04:55.040 - 04:56.600:  Hundreds of flights have been cancelled
04:56.600 - 04:59.800:  and schools, businesses and financial markets have been closed.
05:00.520 - 05:02.500:  In the neighboring Chinese province of Guangdong,
05:02.500 - 05:06.380:  nearly 800,000 people have been moved from high risk areas.
05:07.000 - 05:09.100:  Earlier, streets in Hong Kong were deserted.
05:09.580 - 05:11.560:  So how prepared are people across the region
05:11.560 - 05:14.160:  for typhoon salad in Hong Kong for us?
05:14.160 - 05:15.120:  Here's Martin Yip.
05:15.500 - 05:16.420:  The buildings are shaking,
05:16.420 - 05:19.340:  but there's also something that is less
05:19.920 - 05:23.420:  of a concern for Hong Kong during a typhoon season.
05:23.420 - 05:25.380:  It's usually about debris flying around.
05:25.400 - 05:28.360:  This time we haven't received any reports of that kind.
05:28.360 - 05:31.940:  So it might be the upside of the whole situation at the moment.
05:31.980 - 05:34.360:  And how did the people you've been talking to caught up in this?
05:34.360 - 05:35.800:  How do they feel about it? Are they scared?
05:36.100 - 05:38.420:  Yeah, they do feel scared because there's a building shaking.
05:38.420 - 05:42.820:  And of course this, so wind speed is pretty amazing.
05:43.020 - 05:44.840:  So anything flies around.
05:44.840 - 05:47.060:  That's obviously going to be trouble.
05:47.220 - 05:49.140:  And also having rainfalls are expected
05:49.140 - 05:52.240:  that there's more or less things that people get used to.
05:52.580 - 05:54.840:  It seems this quality lockdown situation
05:54.840 - 05:56.560:  we have to continue all the way
05:57.020 - 06:01.060:  till tomorrow morning and possibly by lunchtime.
06:01.060 - 06:02.900:  And what indicator is from
06:03.300 - 06:05.460:  Kathy Pacific Hong Kong's major airlines
06:05.460 - 06:08.600:  they are expecting to resume outgoing flights from Hong Kong
06:08.680 - 06:09.400:  from midday.
06:09.400 - 06:13.960:  So that might give some hints that until tomorrow afternoon,
06:13.960 - 06:16.220:  we might still have to weather this kind of storm.
06:16.440 - 06:19.460:  So the best advice the government has always been giving
06:19.460 - 06:23.020:  is to stay home, stay away from windy locations,
06:23.060 - 06:24.280:  stay away from the glasses.
06:24.680 - 06:26.120:  Martin Yip in Hong Kong.
06:26.120 - 06:30.400:  Now also following typhoon salad is BBC weather's Stamdenaos.
06:30.920 - 06:32.340:  It's taken an unusual path.
06:32.360 - 06:34.940:  It's not making a direct lamp for it hurtled in
06:34.940 - 06:37.820:  from the east off the South China Sea.
06:37.920 - 06:41.000:  And instead of barreling inland and weakening as it moves inland,
06:41.000 - 06:43.660:  it's actually turned the corner, moving south westward.
06:43.660 - 06:46.880:  So the actual eye is traveling along the coastline
06:46.900 - 06:49.580:  with the outer edges affecting Hong Kong
06:49.580 - 06:52.000:  and the south coast of Guangdong province.
06:52.380 - 06:54.920:  And it's going to continue to move parallel to the coast,
06:55.000 - 06:58.520:  weakening as it does so, pushing southwards through tonight
06:58.520 - 07:01.220:  and into Saturday morning, heading down towards
07:01.220 - 07:04.080:  the Lu Xiao Peninsula and Hainan island
07:04.080 - 07:06.520:  by the time we reach next Monday and Tuesday.
07:06.800 - 07:08.780:  However, it's still bringing some really heavy rainfall
07:08.780 - 07:12.560:  across the coast of southern Guangdong, including Hong Kong.
07:12.720 - 07:14.480:  Well, I mean, they do get typhoons in Hong Kong,
07:14.480 - 07:16.040:  but this one seems to be particularly strong.
07:16.320 - 07:18.560:  Yeah, it has been a while since the Hong Kong area
07:18.740 - 07:21.280:  has seen a powerful typhoon like this,
07:21.860 - 07:23.040:  almost make lump full there,
07:23.080 - 07:24.720:  but other parts of Guangdong are seen
07:24.720 - 07:26.140:  at the impacts from the heavy rain,
07:26.140 - 07:27.760:  the strong winds at the moment.
07:27.980 - 07:29.180:  And there's a different typhoon,
07:29.180 - 07:30.480:  another one approaching Taiwan.
07:30.480 - 07:31.260:  That's right.
07:31.260 - 07:33.020:  We've got typhoon Haikou,
07:33.020 - 07:34.720:  which is barreling towards Taiwan.
07:34.720 - 07:36.440:  That's continuing to strengthen as well.
07:36.440 - 07:38.140:  I don't think it'll reach super typhoon,
07:38.140 - 07:39.020:  but close to.
07:39.500 - 07:40.840:  And then it's like to make landfall
07:40.840 - 07:42.480:  on Sunday across Taiwan,
07:42.480 - 07:44.940:  weakening as it continues through the Taiwan Strait.
07:45.240 - 07:47.620:  And then into each China by our next Tuesday,
07:47.680 - 07:48.880:  so there's a double whammy.
07:48.940 - 07:52.560:  A typhoon impacts across the south and east coast of China.
07:53.200 - 07:55.140:  Stampton Ails from BBC Weather.
07:55.800 - 07:57.400:  The Panama Canal Authority says
07:57.400 - 07:58.900:  waiting times for vessels
07:58.900 - 08:01.360:  that reach the area without a booking have doubled
08:01.360 - 08:03.600:  because of a serious drought in the region.
08:04.100 - 08:06.240:  About 120 ships are currently waiting
08:06.240 - 08:07.380:  for their turn to cross.
08:07.940 - 08:09.520:  Here's our America's regional editor,
08:09.860 - 08:10.560:  Leonardo Russia.
08:11.320 - 08:13.200:  Transit has been restricted for months
08:13.200 - 08:14.980:  and cargo ships are having to wait
08:14.980 - 08:16.780:  on average nine to 10 days
08:16.780 - 08:18.800:  before being allowed to enter the canal.
08:19.360 - 08:20.180:  The Panama Canal,
08:20.180 - 08:22.580:  which links the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific,
08:23.040 - 08:25.360:  uses water from an artificial reservoir,
08:25.920 - 08:26.640:  Lake Gatun,
08:27.060 - 08:28.620:  to feed a system of locks.
08:29.080 - 08:31.300:  In the process vast amounts of fresh water
08:31.300 - 08:32.440:  are lost to the sea.
08:32.840 - 08:34.600:  A prolonged drought in Central America
08:34.600 - 08:35.760:  has forced the administrators
08:35.760 - 08:37.960:  to cut the number of daily crossings
08:38.260 - 08:39.480:  by about 10%,
08:39.920 - 08:41.280:  which has caused a bottleneck
08:41.320 - 08:42.680:  on both ends of the canal.
08:42.680 - 08:45.460:  The restrictions are expected to remain in place
08:45.840 - 08:47.580:  for at least another 10 months.
08:48.540 - 08:49.800:  The auction house Christie's
08:49.800 - 08:52.260:  has said it's canceling plans to sell more jewels
08:52.380 - 08:55.000:  from the estate of the wife of a German billionaire
08:55.000 - 08:57.480:  who made his fortune during the Nazi era.
08:58.000 - 08:59.860:  Part of Heidi Horton's jewelry collection
08:59.860 - 09:01.600:  was auctioned by Christie's in May,
09:01.600 - 09:03.600:  raising more than $200 million.
09:03.900 - 09:05.560:  Christie said the first sale
09:05.560 - 09:07.580:  had provoked intense scrutiny and reaction
09:07.920 - 09:09.660:  that deeply affected the auction house
09:09.720 - 09:10.440:  and many others.
09:11.100 - 09:12.580:  U.S. Attorney Stephen Lieberman
09:12.580 - 09:14.780:  created a group to oppose the first auction.
09:14.780 - 09:17.400:  He told Julian Marshall how Helmut Horton,
09:17.680 - 09:18.980:  a former Nazi party member,
09:19.280 - 09:20.380:  acquired his fortune.
09:21.040 - 09:22.880:  Helmut Horton was an Austrian businessman
09:22.880 - 09:24.860:  who died a billionaire
09:25.260 - 09:27.440:  and his fortune was based in large part
09:27.700 - 09:29.280:  on businesses that he bought
09:29.580 - 09:31.520:  during the Aryanization process
09:31.800 - 09:35.420:  in Germany and Austria in 1936, 37 and 38.
09:35.420 - 09:37.720:  Jewish business owners were required
09:37.720 - 09:39.620:  by law to sell their businesses
09:39.980 - 09:42.220:  and Helmut Horton and others like him
09:42.400 - 09:43.680:  went to Jewish business owners
09:43.680 - 09:45.720:  and made a deeply discounted offer
09:45.720 - 09:48.820:  10%, 20% of the value of businesses
09:49.280 - 09:51.280:  and if people said that the prices were unfair
09:51.280 - 09:53.400:  or they didn't want to sell, Horton said fine,
09:53.400 - 09:55.160:  we'll use our Gestapo connections
09:55.440 - 09:57.720:  and the Gestapo will be at your front door tomorrow
09:57.960 - 10:00.140:  and you and your family will be taken off to the camps
10:00.420 - 10:02.180:  and it was off the backs of those
10:02.420 - 10:03.880:  deeply discounted businesses
10:04.360 - 10:05.780:  that Helmut Horton made his fortune.
10:06.020 - 10:08.680:  Horton after the war married Heidi
10:08.860 - 10:10.740:  and Heidi Horton began to acquire
10:10.740 - 10:13.960:  a fabulously expensive collection of jewelry
10:14.200 - 10:16.040:  using the fortune that he had made
10:16.040 - 10:17.420:  from the business's stolen
10:17.420 - 10:19.400:  from Austrian and from German Jews.
10:20.020 - 10:21.960:  I mean, although they were ill-gotten gains
10:22.380 - 10:25.900:  that jewelry was legally purchased, was it?
10:26.840 - 10:28.180:  The jewelry was legally purchased
10:28.300 - 10:29.920:  but it was purchased with money
10:29.920 - 10:31.540:  that had been stolen from Jews
10:31.860 - 10:33.620:  who ultimately most of them
10:33.720 - 10:35.200:  were sent off to death camps
10:35.200 - 10:36.480:  and murdered by the Nazis.
10:36.860 - 10:39.600:  And that is why you and Jewish groups
10:39.600 - 10:43.900:  subjected to the first sale by Christy's in May.
10:44.240 - 10:46.100:  That's right. When you hear the name Christy's
10:46.100 - 10:48.000:  you think a reputable organization
10:48.160 - 10:49.520:  that cares about its name
10:49.520 - 10:52.120:  but when these issues were brought to Christy's attention
10:52.300 - 10:54.560:  they didn't do anything to stop the auction.
10:54.560 - 10:57.200:  They simply said the jewelry was legally purchased
10:57.380 - 11:00.200:  the jewelry itself was not stolen from Jews
11:00.200 - 11:02.540:  by the Nazis they weren't going to halt the auction
11:02.780 - 11:04.800:  they didn't think about the moral issues
11:05.060 - 11:07.280:  and frankly I don't think they thought about the legal issues
11:07.640 - 11:10.320:  because the jewelry is property that was purchased
11:10.520 - 11:12.900:  with money that was made from stealing businesses
11:13.420 - 11:14.860:  from Jews many of whom were murdered
11:15.160 - 11:17.040:  and there may well be claims on that jewelry
11:17.180 - 11:18.480:  by the descendants of people
11:18.480 - 11:21.180:  who were forced to sell their businesses to Helmut Horton.
11:21.380 - 11:24.660:  Christy's said that the more than $200 million raised
11:24.960 - 11:28.440:  by that first sale would go to philanthropic causes.
11:28.860 - 11:29.680:  Has it, do you know?
11:29.900 - 11:33.340:  These were philanthropic causes chosen by Heidi Horton.
11:33.620 - 11:35.560:  They were not philanthropic causes
11:35.560 - 11:38.680:  designed to reimburse the people from whom
11:38.680 - 11:40.180:  the businesses were stolen.
11:40.620 - 11:42.320:  Faced with a very bad publicity
11:42.320 - 11:44.280:  Christy said that some of the money
11:44.280 - 11:46.620:  would be donated to Holocaust organizations
11:46.760 - 11:49.860:  that was I think quite rightly viewed by Jewish groups
11:50.080 - 11:52.180:  as a bribe to shut these groups up.
11:52.340 - 11:54.200:  Nonetheless you must be satisfied
11:54.200 - 11:58.760:  that Christy's has called off plans to sell more jewels
11:58.760 - 12:01.460:  from the estate of Heidi Horton.
12:01.620 - 12:05.140:  We are very pleased and we ask Christy's to go a step further
12:05.340 - 12:07.620:  and to make a public commit that in the future
12:07.620 - 12:10.360:  they will not sell any more jewelry from this collection
12:10.360 - 12:13.400:  and they will not auction off similar property.
12:13.400 - 12:14.780:  This is blood jewelry.
12:14.940 - 12:17.920:  It would be as if you had somebody who had engaged
12:17.920 - 12:20.040:  in the trafficking of children
12:20.040 - 12:22.140:  and used the money from the trafficking of children
12:22.140 - 12:25.180:  to buy artworks which then Christy put up for sale.
12:25.380 - 12:27.260:  A reputable auction house shouldn't do that
12:27.260 - 12:29.940:  and we call on Christy's to state that it will not engage
12:29.940 - 12:32.420:  in such despicable behavior in the future.
12:33.160 - 12:34.680:  U.S. Attorney Steve Lieberman.
12:35.280 - 12:36.600:  The Egyptian born businessman,
12:36.600 - 12:38.360:  Muhammad Al-Faird, has died.
12:38.360 - 12:39.640:  He was 94.
12:40.360 - 12:42.360:  The self-made billionaire was the former owner
12:42.360 - 12:44.540:  of the famous London department store Harrods
12:44.540 - 12:46.000:  and also Fullham Football Club.
12:46.440 - 12:49.080:  But an inquiry into Mr Al-Faird's business dealings
12:49.080 - 12:52.580:  led successive governments to refuse to grant him British citizenship
12:53.120 - 12:54.120:  much to his frustration.
12:55.140 - 12:58.240:  You think that this is fair from the home secretary
12:58.660 - 13:01.680:  to behave the way with someone like me
13:01.860 - 13:05.360:  who will have given employment to thousands of people
13:06.500 - 13:07.860:  having four British kids.
13:09.880 - 13:12.900:  It just ensures what type of people you know
13:14.260 - 13:16.000:  infiltrate in the political life
13:16.880 - 13:18.740:  and give us such a deal.
13:19.520 - 13:21.780:  Mr Al-Faird's death comes 26 years
13:21.780 - 13:25.000:  after his son Dodie was killed in a car crash in Paris
13:25.000 - 13:28.080:  with Princess Diana, the first wife of King Charles.
13:28.720 - 13:31.600:  A UK correspondent Rob Watson looks back at his life.
13:32.320 - 13:34.880:  Muhammad Faird began in business selling soft drinks
13:34.880 - 13:36.500:  and sewing machines in Egypt.
13:36.980 - 13:40.140:  He went on to own the world's most famous department store
13:40.460 - 13:43.360:  I'm asking fortune and controversy on the way.
13:43.420 - 13:46.000:  He built a shipping business from scratch
13:46.000 - 13:50.920:  and came to Britain in the 1970s, renaming himself Al-Faird.
13:51.440 - 13:53.500:  To those he clashed with and there were many,
13:53.500 - 13:57.080:  he was an abrasive, obsessive character given to fuding.
13:57.340 - 14:00.820:  He bought the Paris Ritz and later the Jewel in the retail crown
14:00.820 - 14:02.940:  the Harrods department store in London.
14:03.480 - 14:06.300:  His battle with Tiny Rowland, Chairman of Longrow,
14:06.340 - 14:08.660:  ahead of that takeover was vitriolic.
14:09.160 - 14:12.840:  A British government inquiry later accused him of dishonesty
14:12.840 - 14:16.000:  and he was repeatedly refused a British passport.
14:16.860 - 14:21.320:  In the mid-1990s he revealed he'd paid British conservative MPs
14:21.580 - 14:23.360:  to ask questions in Parliament.
14:24.020 - 14:26.740:  That put him at the centre of the crisis over sleeves
14:26.740 - 14:30.080:  that eventually felled Prime Minister John Major's government
14:30.080 - 14:32.680:  in the 1997 General Election.
14:33.480 - 14:36.740:  When his son Dodi Al-Faird was killed along with Diana,
14:36.740 - 14:39.400:  Princess of Wales and a car crash in Paris,
14:39.420 - 14:43.880:  he claimed it was murder plotted by the Duke of Edinburgh
14:43.880 - 14:45.860:  and the British Secret Service.
14:46.460 - 14:49.940:  Muhammad Al-Faird refused to accept that the couple's driver
14:49.940 - 14:54.380:  Orgry Paul and employee of his had been drunk at the wheel.
14:54.700 - 14:58.860:  Henry Paul was in the payroll of the MI6 for three years as an informer.
14:59.200 - 15:01.820:  What happened to Diana and what happened to my son
15:02.400 - 15:06.920:  is a murder and I'm not going to keep quiet until I get to that room.
15:07.120 - 15:11.380:  A French investigation and a British inquest rejected those claims.
15:11.420 - 15:16.360:  He gave large sums to charity but was accused of bullying staff too.
15:16.880 - 15:20.780:  He eventually sold harrads after a rar with the pension fund managers
15:21.160 - 15:22.660:  over the size of his dividend.
15:23.360 - 15:27.900:  He cast himself as the underdog yet he'd always craved acceptance
15:27.900 - 15:29.200:  from the establishment.
15:30.000 - 15:32.520:  Rob Watson on the life of Muhammad Al-Faird.
15:35.200 - 15:36.760:  Still to come in the global news podcast,
15:36.760 - 15:40.420:  a rare Iranian and Israeli collaboration to make a film
15:40.420 - 15:42.360:  that's blossomed into something special.
15:42.820 - 15:47.140:  In Israel, that became so extreme and univarned too.
15:47.400 - 15:49.820:  We are not allowed to talk to each other because we're enemies.
15:49.820 - 15:51.020:  That's what they taught us.
15:51.120 - 15:51.600:  But we're not.
15:51.920 - 15:54.060:  We've funded this amazing friendship.
15:54.860 - 15:56.060:  Now on yesterday's podcast,
15:56.060 - 15:58.320:  I ask you to email your little win,
15:58.320 - 15:59.940:  the thing that's happened in your life,
15:59.940 - 16:03.500:  or where you live that's made your week no matter how small.
16:03.500 - 16:06.860:  We're collecting them for next week's edition of The Happy Pod.
16:07.260 - 16:10.240:  And I just wanted to say thank you for all the emails so far.
16:10.240 - 16:11.400:  Here it's just a couple of them.
16:11.640 - 16:16.460:  Hannah in Sydney, Australia says the barista at her local cafe gave her a free coffee.
16:16.900 - 16:19.540:  And then the next day she found a five dollar note on the floor.
16:19.540 - 16:20.860:  So she got another free coffee.
16:21.220 - 16:21.780:  Thank you Hannah.
16:22.080 - 16:24.180:  Carly email from St. Pete in Florida
16:24.580 - 16:27.340:  to thank her neighbors for helping to keep her home dry
16:27.340 - 16:30.980:  and free from debris during the hurricane conditions this week.
16:30.980 - 16:34.960:  I had someone watching over me at a time of pure panic, says Carly.
16:35.480 - 16:39.300:  Of course, we'd like more so please email me with your little win
16:39.460 - 16:43.340:  globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk
16:43.340 - 16:46.080:  globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
16:46.080 - 16:50.000:  You'll hear more of them in The Happy Pod in this feed every Saturday.
16:59.840 - 17:03.220:  Thousands of Syrians have taken to the streets in the north-western city of
17:03.220 - 17:07.320:  Soweda protesting against their deteriorating living and economic conditions.
17:16.320 - 17:20.220:  These demonstrators chanting that people want the downfall of the regime.
17:20.640 - 17:23.400:  Dina Sinjab is our Middle East correspondent in Beirut.
17:23.400 - 17:24.680:  She's been telling my colleague,
17:24.680 - 17:27.460:  Luquaza Barak, more about what's happening in Soweda.
17:27.880 - 17:32.160:  They brought back all the demands that many Syrians across the country
17:32.160 - 17:37.500:  called for in the early days of the uprising in 2011 when there were peaceful protest
17:37.780 - 17:39.520:  as they are today in Soweda.
17:39.900 - 17:44.020:  This is the second week in a row that protesters took to the streets in Soweda
17:44.580 - 17:49.000:  and today was quite significant because thousands of them took to the streets.
17:49.000 - 17:53.160:  They came from different villages and towns around the province of
17:53.160 - 17:58.740:  Soweda, which is predominantly Jews, a city that the regime has always been careful
17:58.740 - 18:00.120:  on how to deal with them.
18:00.120 - 18:03.580:  So there weren't violent crackdown on protesters there.
18:03.840 - 18:07.420:  And what we've seen this time is that the demands of the protesters
18:07.420 - 18:09.480:  is not only criticizing the government,
18:09.480 - 18:13.960:  but really targeting President Bashar al-Assad himself calling on him to leave
18:14.200 - 18:17.180:  and tearing out posters of him everywhere in the city.
18:17.180 - 18:18.980:  So this is quite significant to see.
18:19.340 - 18:23.080:  What was it about the cost of living that brought people out on the streets?
18:23.700 - 18:28.160:  Well, it was a gradual deterioration of the situation since the days of the war
18:28.160 - 18:31.880:  and then the war stopped, so the war economy stopped us,
18:31.880 - 18:34.060:  so dollars that stopped flowing into the country.
18:34.060 - 18:37.640:  The Syrian pound devaluated and cost of living increased,
18:37.640 - 18:42.780:  but the worst was the full lift of subsidy on oil in Syria.
18:42.780 - 18:48.260:  And that's what flipped the coin for many Syrians that they cannot upward living anymore.
18:48.260 - 18:54.240:  The average wage of a Syrian worker in 2011 was almost $500.
18:54.240 - 18:56.220:  Today it's worth $20.
18:56.380 - 19:01.580:  An average family with a $20 they cannot even buy basic food,
19:01.580 - 19:04.600:  let alone meat or any other substantial items,
19:04.600 - 19:07.520:  just basic foods for two or three days that won't be enough.
19:07.520 - 19:08.920:  So people are really starving.
19:08.920 - 19:14.880:  The country has more than 90% of the population living under the poverty line,
19:14.880 - 19:17.940:  so it's not surprising at all that they would take to the streets.
19:18.140 - 19:19.540:  Where are we seeing these protests?
19:19.540 - 19:21.460:  Because they're not in the capital, are they?
19:21.700 - 19:23.000:  That's a very important question.
19:23.000 - 19:27.240:  As I mentioned, this is a Druze province that the regime has been very careful
19:27.240 - 19:28.780:  in dealing with this minority,
19:28.780 - 19:31.160:  that is spreading between Syria and Lebanon.
19:31.360 - 19:34.960:  For example, Dereha next to it, which is predominantly a Sunni one,
19:34.960 - 19:37.200:  which is the birthplace of the uprising.
19:37.200 - 19:38.880:  We've seen some protests there,
19:38.880 - 19:41.700:  but the reaction from the regime there wouldn't be the same,
19:41.700 - 19:43.700:  like a reaction to the Druze.
19:43.840 - 19:47.440:  It's hard to see the army firing at protesters in Sweden
19:47.440 - 19:50.160:  as they did in many Sunni towns across the country.
19:50.160 - 19:52.200:  That's why we're not seeing these kind of protests
19:52.200 - 19:55.140:  in any other government-controlled areas,
19:55.580 - 19:56.680:  because people are scared.
19:56.680 - 19:59.340:  People have been killed, bombed, and detained.
19:59.340 - 20:02.200:  And the regime is very careful in how to deal with the Druze.
20:02.200 - 20:04.560:  That's why we can see this momentum in Sweden,
20:04.560 - 20:07.300:  but it's hard to see it happening somewhere else
20:07.460 - 20:09.760:  after more than a decade of civil war,
20:09.760 - 20:12.980:  hundreds of thousands killed millions in refugees
20:12.980 - 20:15.180:  and tens of thousands of disappeared.
20:15.180 - 20:18.140:  So people are really wary on what to do in the streets,
20:18.140 - 20:19.660:  although the anger is mounting,
20:19.660 - 20:22.160:  even among the allowite community,
20:22.160 - 20:25.220:  that is the main supporter of President Bashar al-Assad.
20:25.540 - 20:28.860:  Last week, the government introduced cuts of income tax,
20:28.900 - 20:31.620:  but that's too little, too late for many people.
20:32.000 - 20:34.680:  However, given the violent nature of this regime,
20:34.760 - 20:38.500:  it's hard to see how long they are going to tolerate this situation there.
20:39.060 - 20:41.580:  Our Middle East correspondent, Lena Sinjab reporting.
20:42.240 - 20:45.180:  An Egyptian government official has submitted his resignation
20:45.320 - 20:48.300:  over the destruction of a number of historic mausoleums
20:48.300 - 20:50.800:  in centuries-old cemeteries in Cairo.
20:51.220 - 20:54.420:  The Egyptian authorities say they're developing and restoring the area,
20:54.420 - 20:57.900:  but the campaign has caused considerable anger on social media
20:58.240 - 21:01.800:  with some saying Cairo's architectural heritage is under threat.
21:02.300 - 21:04.500:  Here's our Arab Affairs editor, Sebastien Usher.
21:05.160 - 21:09.300:  Dr. Aiman Wanas says he's resigning because his task of logging buildings
21:09.300 - 21:13.340:  of historical and architectural value has been rendered futile.
21:13.660 - 21:16.200:  The professor of urban design said the government's project
21:16.200 - 21:19.100:  in the ancient cemeteries of Cairo-risk,
21:19.100 - 21:22.380:  wasting Egypt's rich and irreplaceable heritage.
21:23.040 - 21:25.780:  Several other members of a committee documenting heritage buildings
21:25.780 - 21:26.840:  have already resigned.
21:26.860 - 21:29.740:  The cemeteries in Cairo have long been renowned
21:29.740 - 21:32.980:  for the elaborate decoration and domes of their mausoleums,
21:32.980 - 21:34.600:  dating back hundreds of years.
21:35.240 - 21:38.780:  The authorities say what's happening is urban development that's necessary.
21:39.320 - 21:41.480:  To bring Cairo into a new era.
21:41.900 - 21:44.040:  Critics call it cultural vandalism.
21:44.940 - 21:48.920:  The death of a mother bear shot near a national park in central Italy,
21:48.920 - 21:51.800:  leaving two cubs alone has drawn condemnation
21:51.800 - 21:53.920:  from animal rights groups and politicians.
21:54.620 - 21:59.080:  Europe Regional Editor, Danny Averhard has been telling me more about what happened and why.
21:59.580 - 22:02.960:  This bear, Amarino, that's the nickname for black cherry,
22:02.960 - 22:05.820:  basically, one of the fruits that it was very fond of.
22:05.960 - 22:06.800:  Two things that are important.
22:06.800 - 22:09.680:  One, it was extremely well-known and well-loved in the area.
22:10.020 - 22:14.980:  There was a rather endearing video of the bear going through a local town at night,
22:14.980 - 22:18.660:  only a few days ago with its two cubs and onlookers looking
22:19.520 - 22:21.100:  quite amazed at this scene.
22:21.260 - 22:24.740:  And also, it was a female of a very rare sub-species,
22:24.760 - 22:26.580:  the rarest sub-species of bear in Europe,
22:26.740 - 22:28.220:  a thing called a Maasican brown bear,
22:28.220 - 22:31.080:  which lives in the Aponines in a Brutso,
22:31.120 - 22:33.600:  this era of central Italy east of Rome.
22:34.280 - 22:37.620:  And on Thursday night, it was shot and killed.
22:37.760 - 22:40.420:  The person who did this was a man in his fifties
22:40.860 - 22:43.160:  and he's told the Italian news agency
22:43.560 - 22:47.120:  answer that he did it out of fear, that it was only his property
22:47.420 - 22:49.500:  and he had shot it but it hadn't meant to kill it.
22:49.600 - 22:52.420:  But sadly, the bear died of very bad injuries
22:52.780 - 22:54.880:  and the cubs escaped into the countryside.
22:55.160 - 22:58.700:  There's been quite a bit of reaction both locally and on social media.
22:59.240 - 23:01.640:  Absolutely. First of all, on the political level,
23:01.640 - 23:03.900:  you've had the Minister of the Environment ship in,
23:04.200 - 23:06.300:  you've also had the governor of a Brutso, say,
23:06.300 - 23:09.560:  that it's a very serious act against his whole region.
23:09.560 - 23:11.860:  It leaves pain and anger, he said.
23:12.020 - 23:13.500:  And the head of the National Park,
23:13.500 - 23:15.540:  said this type of bear, is never aggressive.
23:16.220 - 23:19.220:  Everyone loved her and called her a symbol of the park.
23:19.220 - 23:23.040:  And the Rangers, who posted the picture of the dead bear,
23:23.300 - 23:26.020:  said that it was just not justifiable that bear,
23:26.340 - 23:28.660:  and Marina had never created problems for humans,
23:29.340 - 23:32.760:  despite having raided agricultural produce and livestock.
23:34.980 - 23:37.080:  Lots of movies claim to be ground breaking,
23:37.080 - 23:40.100:  but tatami, which premieres at the Venice Film Festival
23:40.100 - 23:41.840:  this weekend, does fit the bill.
23:42.280 - 23:45.340:  It's a co-production between an Iranian and an Israeli.
23:45.960 - 23:48.740:  The film is about a female judo fighter from Iran
23:48.740 - 23:51.220:  who has a shot at winning gold at the world championships,
23:51.220 - 23:54.200:  but the Iranian authorities order her not to compete
23:54.200 - 23:56.420:  against her next opponent who's from Israel,
23:56.800 - 23:59.440:  leaving her and her coach in an awful dilemma.
24:00.140 - 24:02.760:  Here's the moment when commentators notice something's wrong
24:02.760 - 24:04.300:  with the Iranian contestant.
24:20.240 - 24:22.660:  The co-directors are the Israeli guy-native
24:22.660 - 24:24.140:  and the Iranians are Amir.
24:24.140 - 24:27.580:  First a guy, Tim Franks, asked him what inspired the film?
24:28.080 - 24:31.820:  In the middle of the pandemic, I read an article
24:31.860 - 24:34.900:  about an Iranian boxer named Sadav Kadim.
24:34.980 - 24:38.320:  She really wanted to box Iran, but she couldn't,
24:38.380 - 24:40.420:  and she escaped to France,
24:40.420 - 24:43.620:  where she became the first Iranian female boxer.
24:43.860 - 24:46.980:  And then more female stories about athletes
24:46.980 - 24:50.740:  who rebelled against the regime in Iran for freedom
24:52.020 - 24:52.600:  in the news.
24:52.840 - 24:55.800:  And that brought the idea to make a movie about that,
24:56.060 - 24:57.700:  especially when the Israeli athletes
24:57.700 - 25:00.020:  and the Iranian athletes are best friends
25:00.020 - 25:02.720:  in the competition outside of their homes.
25:02.900 - 25:03.480:  Your Israeli?
25:03.480 - 25:07.100:  Was that the reason why you then try to get in touch with Zah?
25:07.320 - 25:11.080:  Absolutely. And Elham, who wrote the script with me.
25:11.240 - 25:14.500:  So I brought a lot of Iranian artists with me
25:14.720 - 25:16.420:  to tell this specific story.
25:16.640 - 25:19.000:  And Zah, how long did it take you to decide
25:19.000 - 25:21.580:  that this was a project that you'd like to be involved in?
25:21.700 - 25:23.520:  I took me a little bit of time,
25:23.600 - 25:25.540:  because it can be risky for everyone,
25:25.780 - 25:27.460:  because even outside of Iran,
25:27.720 - 25:30.480:  I think that this global situation
25:30.480 - 25:34.760:  of our society and our planet is to rush towards this laughter.
25:35.080 - 25:38.660:  We don't know how long we will all be able to live,
25:38.740 - 25:41.820:  but at least during this time we do something good.
25:42.220 - 25:43.460:  I just start doing this,
25:43.820 - 25:45.860:  is a feat, it's staring, it's beautiful.
25:46.180 - 25:48.000:  Because we've never seen it before.
25:48.260 - 25:50.620:  It's being sort of talked about as a first, this collaboration.
25:50.760 - 25:53.820:  You live in exile in France yourself.
25:53.820 - 25:55.920:  You left Iran some years ago.
25:56.160 - 25:57.060:  In 2008.
25:57.300 - 26:00.400:  But you just said to me that you had to think about it a bit
26:00.400 - 26:02.540:  because it's a very risky project,
26:02.700 - 26:04.320:  even with you living in exile.
26:04.320 - 26:06.020:  Can you tell me why that is?
26:06.280 - 26:07.440:  As an Iranian filmmaker,
26:07.440 - 26:11.060:  what is happening in Iran and Israel is almost the same.
26:11.360 - 26:12.500:  Political situation.
26:12.500 - 26:15.580:  We don't know what risk exactly you take.
26:16.240 - 26:18.760:  Not only because I'm afraid of Iranian government,
26:18.760 - 26:21.940:  but the story that we are telling in this movie
26:22.120 - 26:25.100:  is exactly what goes on with us,
26:25.140 - 26:28.480:  because that government that power can influence me,
26:28.480 - 26:30.360:  can control me sometimes,
26:30.360 - 26:33.240:  even from thousand kilometers away.
26:33.920 - 26:38.960:  It also sounds like you both were drawn to the idea of this fact
26:38.960 - 26:41.720:  that in Israeli and an Iranian were cooperating.
26:41.760 - 26:44.160:  There was a bigger story behind the scenes guy.
26:44.400 - 26:48.000:  What our government are preventing us from doing, we achieved.
26:48.200 - 26:50.980:  It's kind of sad that we have to get out of our country,
26:51.060 - 26:53.440:  to the ability of Georgia, to meet each other,
26:53.600 - 26:55.600:  to feel like we are sisters and brothers,
26:55.600 - 26:58.980:  to understand that we are from the same tribe in Israel
26:58.980 - 27:02.780:  that became so extreme and in Iran too.
27:03.080 - 27:04.800:  We are not allowed to talk to each other
27:04.880 - 27:05.520:  because we're enemies.
27:05.520 - 27:07.280:  That's what they taught us in school.
27:07.600 - 27:08.020:  But we're not.
27:08.020 - 27:11.680:  We've found this amazing friendship that is for life.
27:12.020 - 27:15.220:  We have the same taste, food, movies, music,
27:15.220 - 27:18.680:  sports, and we shot this film under the radar
27:19.180 - 27:21.820:  with a different name, and we made it.
27:21.900 - 27:24.500:  And that's why this collaboration is so important for us.
27:24.600 - 27:26.760:  It's kind of crazy that both countries
27:27.000 - 27:28.420:  are going through the same process.
27:28.760 - 27:30.620:  Those people who are fighting in Israel
27:30.620 - 27:32.960:  against the regime by Benjamin Netanyahu.
27:33.020 - 27:35.080:  A lot of people are going to the street to demonstrate
27:35.280 - 27:37.260:  when it's kind of crazy that Zara came to Israel
27:37.260 - 27:39.900:  to edit the film in time of demonstrations.
27:39.940 - 27:43.960:  We were in the same ground to demonstrate the fight for democracy
27:43.960 - 27:45.560:  and the same thing happens in Iran.
27:46.200 - 27:49.460:  I hope this movie opens another window.
27:49.800 - 27:51.340:  We need to change our mindset.
27:51.340 - 27:53.940:  We need to change how we see each other.
27:54.260 - 27:55.300:  We don't need enemy.
27:55.300 - 28:00.000:  This movie is my first feature as director, co-director.
28:00.360 - 28:02.860:  I really love this movie and I'm very proud.
28:03.100 - 28:06.820:  And I hope we make them feel good about this friendship.
28:07.480 - 28:10.680:  Israeli Guy Natty of the Iranians are Amir with Tim Franks
28:11.060 - 28:12.500:  about the film Tatamee.
28:13.520 - 28:16.520:  Let's go to the Mexican town of Pee Hee Hee Pan now.
28:16.520 - 28:18.920:  Local people there have been keeping themselves busy
28:18.920 - 28:20.220:  with a bit of record-breaking.
28:20.700 - 28:24.100:  The residents have banded together to, well, band together,
28:24.500 - 28:28.340:  a giant ball of cheese weaving together cheese strings
28:28.340 - 28:31.260:  to make a ball the size of a refrigerator.
28:32.080 - 28:33.940:  Sounds like a story for Stephanie Prentice.
28:38.780 - 28:42.600:  A giant spinning wheel surrounded by 80 determined Mexicans
28:42.600 - 28:46.540:  in white overalls feeding long strings of white cheese into it
28:46.780 - 28:47.900:  to form a ball.
28:49.920 - 28:53.900:  But this was no normal day playing with a giant ball of cheese, no.
28:54.420 - 28:57.700:  These dairy farmers and cheese professionals had a plan
28:58.480 - 29:01.740:  to make a ball of cheese so large that they break the world record
29:01.740 - 29:07.080:  of a 350 kilogram sphere using KCO a mozzarella-like
29:07.080 - 29:10.620:  stretchy semi-hard cheese drawn out into long strings.
29:12.340 - 29:13.920:  It is a source of pride for us.
29:13.920 - 29:16.040:  We're happy, proud to be here.
29:16.460 - 29:19.260:  For us and for our cattle producers in this region,
29:19.640 - 29:21.540:  it is going to be a part of history,
29:22.620 - 29:25.420:  to have the biggest piece of cheese in the world.
29:26.700 - 29:29.360:  Making the biggest piece of cheese in the world
29:29.360 - 29:31.160:  wasn't all smooth sailing.
29:31.980 - 29:34.620:  At one point, the Kurds nearly had their way,
29:34.620 - 29:36.860:  tilting dangerously close to the ground.
29:37.880 - 29:40.860:  But the crowd were there to cheer the workers on.
29:42.180 - 29:44.580:  And after much cheering and much spinning,
29:44.580 - 29:49.360:  a 558 kilogram piece of wound up cheese was created.
29:50.860 - 29:54.040:  Smashing the previous record and securing the team's place
29:54.040 - 29:57.880:  in the record books, and he he-a-pants place on the map.
29:59.440 - 30:00.700:  Stephanie Prentice reporting.
30:03.020 - 30:05.560:  Well, I definitely can't beat the Kurds nearly had their way,
30:05.560 - 30:06.900:  so that's all from us for now.
30:06.900 - 30:09.460:  There will be a new edition of Global News to download later.
30:09.860 - 30:11.540:  This one was mixed by Javit Golani.
30:11.540 - 30:12.760:  The producer was Emma Joseph.
30:12.760 - 30:14.800:  The editor is Karen Martin.
30:15.020 - 30:15.680:  I'm Andrew Peach.
30:15.680 - 30:16.440:  Thanks for listening.
30:16.820 - 30:18.200:  And until next time, goodbye.
30:18.200 - 30:22.440:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did
30:28.760 - 30:32.740:  to get so ridiculously rich?
30:32.860 - 30:36.460:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire takes one billionaire at a time
30:36.460 - 30:39.180:  and explains exactly how they made their money.
30:39.360 - 30:41.460:  And then we decide if they are actually good,
30:41.460 - 30:43.040:  bad, or just plain wealthy.
30:43.200 - 30:45.840:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy
30:45.840 - 30:48.700:  as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos really did
30:48.720 - 30:50.540:  to become the first person in history
30:50.540 - 30:51.960:  to pocket $100 billion.
30:51.960 - 30:55.080:  Listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me, Simon Jack.
