00:34.440 - 00:39.580:  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 11th of September, these are our main stories.
00:40.260 - 00:45.640:  Rescue teams in Morocco continue to search for survivors of last Friday's earthquake
00:45.660 - 00:50.780:  with the death toll now standing at two and a half thousand. The United States and Vietnam
00:50.780 - 00:56.880:  have issued a joint statement warning against the threat or use of force in the disputed South China
00:56.880 - 01:03.680:  Sea. A China verminally denies reports that a parliamentary researcher in London has been spying
01:03.680 - 01:11.700:  for Beijing. Also in this podcast. When I see the news and reinforcements by both sides,
01:11.700 - 01:19.140:  I lose hope, but I have to be strong. This is not the time to give up. We hear from residents caught
01:19.140 - 01:25.820:  up in warfare in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, and we have reaction to Novak Jokovic's US Open
01:25.820 - 01:34.900:  Trial. The toll from the Moroccan earthquake continues to rise. The government there now says almost
01:34.900 - 01:40.920:  two and a half thousand people are confirmed to have died. Many of the worst hit villages are yet to
01:40.920 - 01:46.640:  be reached, so that figure is certain to rise further. With heavy machinery unable to get through
01:46.640 - 01:51.680:  blocked roads, villages have been using their bare hands to search under the rubble. People are
01:51.680 - 01:57.100:  still being pulled out alive, but our correspondent Tom Bateman, who's reached one of the worst hit
01:57.100 - 02:02.640:  areas of the Atlas Mountains, says time is running out to find more survivors. He sent this report
02:02.640 - 02:10.460:  from close to the epicenter of the quake. Dawn lights up the destruction in the village of Mule
02:10.460 - 02:17.160:  Brahim. Morocco's most remote hillsides have become encampments of the survivors.
02:18.660 - 02:23.980:  Hakima has lost contact with her son, who fled the village, she says, to get help.
02:24.800 - 02:30.260:  She was already grieving. Her husband had been sick and died before the quake came.
02:34.580 - 02:41.500:  We are staying in the streets. I feel bad for my son. His dad passed away and I have to take care of him,
02:41.780 - 02:42.520:  says Hakima.
02:50.420 - 02:57.460:  People are here to help each other. The village's mosque, still standing, becomes a makeshift refuge.
02:58.440 - 03:03.320:  But in the morning we spent here, there were no signs of any official aid response.
03:04.560 - 03:10.440:  Hussein survived when his son freed him from the wreckage of their home, but his wife,
03:10.440 - 03:18.540:  Fatna, was killed. My wife, she stayed in the house. The ceiling came down and struck her.
03:19.260 - 03:24.080:  This comes from God, but thankfully my son is safe, Hussein tells me.
03:27.300 - 03:32.500:  This is where homes once stood. Now people walk through a cascade of ruins.
03:33.340 - 03:38.340:  Recovery attempts across this remote region have been painfully slow.
03:39.520 - 03:45.420:  So far this clear up is people having to do it by themselves. One of their neighbours at the
03:45.420 - 03:49.980:  top of the street here, the house was struck. A family of six was inside and five of them
03:49.980 - 03:57.160:  have been killed, only the father has survived. But it feels like people barely even have time to
03:57.160 - 04:01.300:  grieve. You can see the humanitarian challenge that now remains.
04:02.940 - 04:09.420:  In another village, locals pull a body from the rubble. Spanish rescuers are on the ground there too,
04:09.420 - 04:16.300:  saying the destruction is absolute. Meanwhile, British rescue gear has arrived with a team of
04:16.300 - 04:25.080:  60 specialists deployed from the UK. People are retrieving what they can from homes to damage to
04:25.080 - 04:30.520:  living. Morocco's survivors are now on the land, with all they have left.
04:32.440 - 04:37.440:  Tom Bateman reporting. To Vietnam now, where 50 years ago,
04:37.440 - 04:43.620:  America was still at war with the communists in Hanoi. This weekend saw the culmination of a
04:43.620 - 04:48.140:  long rapprochement between the US and Vietnam. He added his thoughts on this on Monday,
04:48.140 - 04:54.120:  speaking after a major aviation deal with Vietnam Airlines and the US firm Boeing, worth almost
04:54.120 - 05:00.320:  8 billion dollars. Our partnership is about so much more than innovation in investments.
05:01.120 - 05:08.560:  It's about people. It's about creating a free and open Indo-Pacific for all people.
05:10.000 - 05:14.180:  Well, on the last day of Mr. Biden's trip, the visit took on a more political tone as he and
05:14.180 - 05:20.620:  the Vietnamese leader, Nguyen Phu Trang, made a joint statement warning against the threat or
05:20.620 - 05:26.720:  use of force in the disputed South China Sea. Last week, China's Coast Guard was accused of
05:26.720 - 05:31.520:  illegally interfering with supply boats from the Philippines. I correspond at Laura Bicar,
05:31.520 - 05:37.420:  who's in Vietnam. Toby Moore. Quite surprising from Hanoi, who appears to be taking a strong
05:37.420 - 05:42.420:  stance on this and standing up to Beijing on this. If you look at the communicates,
05:42.420 - 05:48.240:  actually in part of the joint leader's statement that was issued to us, I think it's worth mentioning.
05:48.240 - 05:55.660:  It's the only time China is mentioned in the whole document, but it does say, and both leaders
05:56.100 - 06:01.500:  have signed their names to it, that competing claims on the waterway must be settled
06:01.500 - 06:07.220:  under international norms. Now, they say the leaders underscored their unwavering support for the
06:07.220 - 06:11.860:  peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, and here comes the key bit
06:12.220 - 06:18.940:  without the threat or use of force. Now, just last week, state media here in Vietnam reported
06:18.940 - 06:25.280:  that a fishing vessel, Vietnamese fishing vessel, had been water cannonned by the Chinese
06:25.280 - 06:33.160:  Coast Guard, the latest in what Vietnam claims are a number of rising tensions in what they claim
06:33.160 - 06:40.260:  in the South China Sea. China claims quite a large swath of the waterway, despite an international
06:40.260 - 06:48.260:  tribunal saying otherwise. Vietnam says that China is building on islands, that they also have claims
06:48.980 - 06:54.840:  there are various white back and forth between Hanoi and Beijing on this, and obviously in their
06:54.840 - 07:00.780:  statement, they've decided to take a stand with Washington by their side. I think it's unlikely
07:00.780 - 07:05.860:  that Hanoi will raise their voice to China on anything else, and when it comes to kind of
07:05.860 - 07:10.560:  smoothing out the way for this visit, they have had several meetings with Chinese officials
07:10.560 - 07:16.100:  of the last few weeks. Laura, over the weekend, President Biden was saying, I think we think too much
07:16.100 - 07:22.680:  in terms of Cold War terms. It's not about being opposed to Beijing. It's about generating economic
07:22.680 - 07:27.700:  growth and stability for everybody, but Beijing's got to follow the rules. How do you think Beijing
07:27.700 - 07:34.360:  will react to what's been said over the last day? Well, I think it will be interesting to see how
07:34.360 - 07:40.500:  they do react, because over the last few months, they have accused the Biden administration of
07:40.860 - 07:45.120:  having a Cold War mentality, and that is what I put to the President in his press conference
07:45.120 - 07:50.940:  last night here in Hanoi. I asked him what his response to that would be, and that was his
07:50.940 - 07:56.340:  answer. He said, we think too much in Cold War mentality. But from Beijing's point of view,
07:56.340 - 08:01.240:  he has watched the United States steadily increase its presence across the Asia Pacific over
08:01.640 - 08:06.140:  the last year. We've seen Japan and South Korea brought into the same room. Something we never
08:06.140 - 08:11.420:  thought would ever happen. And then they've had a deal where the Philippines have offered the
08:11.420 - 08:17.080:  United States the use of four more bases. The US has also done deals in the Pacific islands,
08:17.100 - 08:22.660:  and now here they are in Beijing's backyard, signing the highest level of agreement that Hanoi
08:23.000 - 08:27.180:  offers. And obviously, they're doing much more business. You just heard there about a Boeing
08:27.180 - 08:32.320:  contract. There's going to be contracts on semiconductors also. So I think when it comes to that,
08:32.320 - 08:36.820:  Beijing will be watching closely. One analyst I did speak to said that Beijing seems to have been
08:36.820 - 08:43.560:  taken by surprise by how fast the United States has moved into the Asia Pacific region.
08:44.040 - 08:47.900:  And perhaps Beijing's reaction will be to that. That was Laura Bicker.
08:48.840 - 08:53.140:  Well, we've also been following Beijing's reaction to allegations that a parliamentary
08:53.140 - 08:59.220:  researcher in London has been spying for China. The Manacuse has released a statement through
08:59.220 - 09:04.580:  his lawyers saying that he's completely innocent of these claims and had spent his career highlighting
09:04.580 - 09:10.260:  what he called the threats presented by the Chinese Communist Party. Mounding is a spokesperson
09:10.260 - 09:19.180:  for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. So called Chinese espionage activities against the UK are
09:19.180 - 09:25.420:  purely groundless. China resolutely opposes this. We urge the UK side to stop spreading false
09:25.420 - 09:30.000:  information and stop its political manipulation and malicious framing of China.
09:30.700 - 09:35.520:  Well, senior MPs from the governing conservative party in the UK have called for China to be
09:35.520 - 09:41.000:  categorized as a threat to British interests. Well, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunerk has
09:41.000 - 09:45.480:  said if I declined to take that step, but he raised concerns about interference from Beijing
09:46.140 - 09:53.100:  with China's premier at the recent G20 summit in India. So does the UK consider China a threat?
09:53.760 - 09:58.380:  Here's the business secretary, Keny Ben-Knock speaking to my colleague Justin Webb.
09:58.660 - 10:05.420:  China is an epoch defining challenge for us as well as many of the other countries in the world.
10:05.420 - 10:10.440:  But you don't define it as a threat? Why not? I think that we have to be very careful with the
10:10.680 - 10:17.400:  language that we use. And what we do is have those conversations with China directly. I can't
10:17.400 - 10:21.320:  comment on the specifics of this investigation, but the Prime Minister spoke to the Chinese
10:21.320 - 10:26.060:  Premier at the weekend about this, setting out our very strong concerns about interference
10:26.600 - 10:31.840:  in parliament. And I think that that's the key thing that this should be noted. Whether or not
10:32.500 - 10:39.420:  you use words like threat, I think, is, you know, it's a reflection of how far you want to escalate
10:39.420 - 10:44.360:  things. China is the second largest economy in the world. It's heavily integrated in our economy
10:44.360 - 10:49.440:  as it is with many of our allies like America, Canada and Australia. And we're taking the same
10:49.440 - 10:53.680:  approach that those countries are taking. I asked our political correspondent Ian Watson about the
10:53.680 - 10:57.700:  alleged spies response to the accusations. The person at the center of these allegations,
10:57.700 - 11:03.540:  the parliamentary researcher, has denied them. In fact, he said that he spent his time in a statement
11:03.540 - 11:09.340:  for his lawyer. He spent his time trying to expose the Chinese Communist Party. And indeed,
11:09.340 - 11:13.760:  he was working very closely with some of the members of parliament who have been most critical of
11:13.780 - 11:18.340:  China, including Tom Tuggenhardt, when he chaired a cross-party committee on foreign affairs. He's
11:18.340 - 11:24.760:  now, of course, a government minister. So I guess the allegations that he was getting close to some
11:24.760 - 11:30.520:  of China's critics on behalf of Beijing, he's saying, in fact, actually, he was genuinely working
11:30.520 - 11:35.060:  with these people because he too is critical. He said he spent his career to date trying to
11:35.120 - 11:39.900:  educate others about the challenges and threats presented by the Chinese Communist Party.
11:40.180 - 11:45.260:  And Ian, this issue of whether or not to categorize China as a threat to British interests,
11:45.260 - 11:50.340:  at the moment, to Rishi Sena, as we were saying, it's allowed to go that far. What would it take
11:50.340 - 11:54.820:  do you think for that to happen, though? I think you probably need more evidence of China's
11:54.820 - 11:59.220:  activities, although there's been plenty of concern over the years. You know that while we
11:59.220 - 12:06.940:  contract, for example, we know about allegations of industrial espionage, we know about accusations
12:06.940 - 12:11.760:  of cyber crimes. There's been a whole range of concerns which have been out there, but I think
12:11.760 - 12:16.980:  people worried about whether the activities stretch into the heart of government. So this development,
12:16.980 - 12:21.680:  I think, has given fuel to the fire of those who are saying that more action should be taken
12:22.040 - 12:26.940:  towards China and more skepticism expressed towards China. That said, Rishi Sena's own position
12:26.940 - 12:32.140:  was that he'd rather be in the room raising concerns than if you like boycotting relations with China.
12:32.140 - 12:36.180:  So it doesn't look like yoga down that road. And interestingly, the trade minister can be
12:36.180 - 12:40.760:  bathing up as well, pointing out the economic value of the relationship with China. So I think the
12:41.420 - 12:47.140:  position in government irrespective of this development is that there should be criticism
12:47.140 - 12:54.600:  but also engagement with Beijing. Ian Watson, it is five months since the conflict began in Sudan.
12:54.600 - 12:59.720:  And according to the United Nations, thousands of people have been killed and around five million
12:59.720 - 13:05.380:  people displaced because of fighting between government forces and a militia group. Sunday saw
13:05.380 - 13:10.740:  the deadliest single act of violence since the war began when airstrikes hit a market in the south
13:10.860 - 13:17.480:  of the capital, Khartoum, killing close to 50 people. So what is life like now for many people
13:17.480 - 13:22.860:  across Sudan? Ahmed, who lives in Khartoum, sent us his audio diary.
13:30.000 - 13:36.620:  This is Ahmed from Sudan. In few days for the world, the war in Sudan will complete five months.
13:37.340 - 13:43.400:  For me and my family, it's like five years. Last Sunday, an intense crash has erupted
13:44.040 - 13:49.460:  two meters in front of our main door between the Sudanese armed forces and the paramilitary
13:49.460 - 14:00.620:  rapid support forces. I was left with the only option of sending my family and dozens of relatives
14:00.760 - 14:06.160:  that were staying at our house to a mosque and a public school to serve their lives from the
14:06.160 - 14:13.200:  crashes. It was the toughest decision I ever made in my life. All of a sudden, we found ourselves
14:13.200 - 14:20.060:  in a middle of war in a place that considered to be one of the safest in the capital. I had only
14:20.060 - 14:26.280:  few seconds to take the right decision whether they should leave in the middle of the crashes
14:26.860 - 14:32.320:  or stay home and be subjected to a risk of artillery shelling by one of the warring sites.
14:33.080 - 14:39.700:  My mom, kids and wife were lucky to meet a friend on the way to the mosque who insisted on taking
14:39.700 - 14:49.660:  them home and shelter for that night. Now, my family is scattered at four different locations
14:49.660 - 14:55.640:  because none of the sites is big enough to accommodate all of them. I had to leave home myself
14:55.640 - 15:01.460:  few days after the family left that night because the paramilitary rapid support forces
15:01.460 - 15:06.940:  shelter our house with a mortar while I was inside and partially damaged the building.
15:06.940 - 15:14.100:  My mom's calls and pressure from the relatives forced me to leave in tears. Leaving your home is
15:14.100 - 15:20.400:  one of the worst experiences of war because the chances are very high that you might not be able to
15:20.400 - 15:27.340:  return. I am currently splitting myself at four locations the mornings between friends in
15:27.340 - 15:34.740:  walkable neighborhoods when the situation is quiet. For the night I sleep over at any house that
15:34.740 - 15:41.140:  has electricity and running water. The nights for me are mainly for thinking where I should go
15:41.140 - 15:49.820:  to the next morning. The war in Sudan is taking the country to complete darkness. The destruction
15:50.560 - 15:57.720:  is beyond imagination. This country is absolutely turning into complete anarchy.
15:58.740 - 16:05.580:  Few days before we became an IDPs we were thinking at a dinner of post-war phase.
16:06.460 - 16:12.740:  My mom said she would slaughter a sheep as a farewell for the relatives staying at a house that
16:12.740 - 16:19.760:  have expressed interest to return. I had plans to plant trees and open free English language
16:19.760 - 16:25.780:  and Arabic class for the children including my own. But the destiny took us to an opposite
16:25.780 - 16:33.640:  direction from settled people to IDPs. However, I'm still very grateful to God because my entire
16:33.640 - 16:41.260:  family is okay. I continuously try to convince myself silently that these tough days will end soon
16:41.720 - 16:48.120:  and we would be able to return to the home I was born at and slaughter a sheep as well as planting
16:48.120 - 16:56.320:  the trees. When I see the news and reinforcements by both sides I lose hope but I have to be strong.
16:56.320 - 17:03.420:  This is not the time to give up. It's time to fight for the family and for my unplanted trees.
17:04.600 - 17:13.240:  That was Ahmed on surviving Sudan's war.
17:15.920 - 17:20.480:  Still to come. It just basically says to you when you're thin when you're skinny. This is what we
17:20.480 - 17:25.980:  like and this is what's going to make you successful. We hit first hand about bullying and body
17:25.980 - 17:38.920:  shaming at the top of British ballet. Unexpected element is all about finding the surprising science
17:38.920 - 17:45.020:  angles to everyday news. I love that this show has the scope to discuss both emergent AI,
17:45.020 - 17:51.020:  new clearing Ghana and also what those stringy bits are on a banana and joining the dots between
17:51.020 - 17:56.540:  their global connections. Nature does pack a lot surprises for us. An invisibility cloak in the
17:56.540 - 18:02.320:  acoustic domain. So cool. That's unexpected elements from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever
18:02.320 - 18:10.540:  you get your BBC podcasts. Daniel Calif, the terror suspect who sparked a manhunt in the UK last
18:10.540 - 18:16.420:  week has appeared in court charged with escaping from prison. The hearing heard that Mr Calif
18:16.720 - 18:22.380:  a former soldier in the British army allegedly escaped by tie himself under a food delivery
18:22.380 - 18:27.940:  lorry with a strap made from bedsheets. He was being kept at one's worth prison in London.
18:28.460 - 18:33.200:  Our reporter Anna Foster was at Westminster Mergers Drates Court in central London for the hearing.
18:33.600 - 18:38.300:  He was in that blue police fan which is generally only used for for terror suspects. It's one of
18:38.300 - 18:43.380:  the high security vehicles that the police use. You could see also the sirens of the unmarked police
18:43.380 - 18:48.800:  vehicles and notably as well the entrance the vehicle entrance into the court was flanked with
18:48.800 - 18:54.660:  police officers as he was driven in this morning. He appeared in court number one again flanked by
18:54.660 - 19:00.440:  two police officers. He was wearing a grey tracksuit sat quietly in the dock. He spoke only to
19:00.440 - 19:05.960:  confirm his name and date of birth. Now there was legal discussion about the charge, the new charge
19:05.960 - 19:11.620:  which he is facing because of course he was already on remand at ones with prison accused of
19:11.620 - 19:16.700:  terrorism offences and offences under the official secrets act which he denies. He is now
19:16.700 - 19:22.580:  further charged with escaping from prison escaping from lawful custody at the allegation as
19:22.580 - 19:27.820:  that he was working in the prison kitchen and he managed to smuggle himself out underneath the
19:27.820 - 19:34.000:  food truck. That is now the subject of a police investigation. But there was no indication of
19:34.000 - 19:39.000:  plea at this stage during this very short hearing which only lasted about eight minutes or so.
19:39.000 - 19:43.920:  He was of course denied bail. There was no application for bail so he will go back to prison. His
19:43.920 - 19:48.300:  next court appearance will be at the end of the month in front of the central criminal court.
19:49.400 - 19:55.580:  That was Anna Foster. Ballet places a huge strain on dancers training to become professionals.
19:55.580 - 20:00.700:  The physical and mental challenges are immense and here in Britain some of the country's elite
20:00.700 - 20:05.740:  ballet schools are facing accusations of bullying and body shaming from former students.
20:06.280 - 20:10.360:  The BBC has spoken to a number of them who say that they've all suffered eating disorders
20:10.360 - 20:14.840:  and depression after attending the schools as children. Haley Hassel reports.
20:19.060 - 20:26.400:  These teenage dancers have big dreams. Most of the pupils in this lesson are around 16 and many
20:26.400 - 20:33.800:  have been dancing since they were three or four years old. Ballet training is hard. You have to
20:33.800 - 20:38.840:  be tough to make it as a professional. I know about this world because I was one's part of it.
20:39.440 - 20:44.840:  As a child I wanted to be a ballerina until a knee injury ended my dancing days and I became a
20:44.840 - 20:50.760:  journalist instead. I have a lot of happy memories of performances, costumes and the friends that I made.
20:51.500 - 20:56.320:  But not everyone in this intense high pressured world can say the same. He literally just went
20:56.320 - 21:01.960:  out of his way to just break me into little teeny tiny pieces and then didn't really do very
21:01.960 - 21:07.260:  much to build me up. For the BBC's File on 4 programme I've spoken to over 20 dancers
21:07.260 - 21:12.460:  who've told me that they think they've been body shamed and bullied at school. Ellen joined
21:12.460 - 21:18.360:  the Royal Ballet School at 16. Just two weeks later she claims one of the teachers took her aside.
21:18.700 - 21:24.380:  She used her kind of hand to cut my bum off and then cut basically the whole of the back of my
21:24.380 - 21:30.080:  leg off all the way down to my heel and just said you know if I had a knife this is what I'd cut off.
21:30.440 - 21:34.820:  Ellen tells me the alleged comment made her concerned about what she ate.
21:35.580 - 21:40.160:  Later she was surprised at the clash reaction when she returned to school after being unwell.
21:40.340 - 21:44.740:  I came back into the studio I felt awful and I had lost weight so I hadn't been very well.
21:45.340 - 21:49.440:  The whole class cut me. It just basically says to you when you're thin, when you're skinny.
21:49.440 - 21:52.660:  This is what we like and this is what's going to make you successful.
21:52.660 - 21:56.840:  The Royal Ballet School say that the applause might have been to welcome her back.
21:57.180 - 22:02.600:  Ellen did become a successful ballerina. She says she developed an eating disorder which lasted
22:02.600 - 22:08.680:  15 years. Terry Hyde is a former ballet dancer and now a psychologist who now councils dancers
22:08.680 - 22:14.860:  from all over the world. He says the majority of those he speaks to tell him they have issues
22:14.860 - 22:22.960:  with food. It's those in power, those in a position of trust that then create the issue of
22:23.720 - 22:31.020:  a body needs to be thin. And then the dancers, mostly the female dancers, will have this idea I
22:31.020 - 22:36.240:  need to look thin. Therefore I need to restrict in what I eat. I need to be careful what I eat.
22:36.580 - 22:42.180:  Then it goes beyond that to eating disorders and body dysmorphia.
22:42.520 - 22:45.660:  Ellen has now begun legal action against the Royal Ballet School.
22:46.200 - 22:48.960:  Dino Nakivelli from Lead Aselicitors is representing.
22:49.420 - 22:53.840:  These women are entitled to a duty of care. Their parents will pay in for them to receive
22:53.840 - 22:57.720:  this education by professionals, which is a care for them to progress their careers.
22:58.060 - 23:03.700:  People within the ballet companies might say that they pushed these students to make them better
23:03.700 - 23:10.040:  ballerinas. What do you say to them? We do not see how any ballet school can say that these acts
23:10.040 - 23:14.060:  were implemented for your benefit. They clearly caused distress.
23:14.460 - 23:18.720:  The Royal Ballet School says previous allegations have been investigated and resolved
23:18.720 - 23:24.560:  and do not align with their records. The school says it's ready to investigate any new claims
23:24.560 - 23:30.320:  and continuously improves to protect its students' health and welfare. Throughout this investigation,
23:30.320 - 23:36.060:  the BBC spoke to over 50 dancers across four different dance schools, many of whom say that
23:36.060 - 23:38.880:  this culture goes beyond just a handful of schools.
23:46.820 - 23:51.180:  Now for a bit of trivia, which country has the fastest growing economy in the world?
23:52.040 - 23:57.420:  Well, if you said Guyana, then you'd be correct. The small South American nation grew by 62%
23:57.580 - 24:03.300:  last year, according to the International Monetary Fund, where the growth has come from newly
24:03.300 - 24:09.540:  found oil and gas reserves. But Guyana's president, if I'm Ali, says his country is facing a race
24:09.540 - 24:15.000:  against time to capitalize on their oil wealth before global climate commitments come into action.
24:15.680 - 24:21.480:  The BBC's Gideon Long has been speaking to him. The country at this moment is in transformation
24:21.480 - 24:27.140:  gear. It's a lot of energy, a lot of infrastructure work, a lot of investment in education,
24:27.200 - 24:32.520:  in health and housing, a number of hotels being constructed, apartment buildings,
24:32.520 - 24:39.080:  apartment complexes, and the construction sector is the prime beneficiary as a spin-off of
24:39.080 - 24:43.480:  what is happening in the oil and gas sector. What are your plans? And particularly what are your
24:43.480 - 24:47.920:  plans in terms of OPEC? I read that there's been a discussion about where the Guyana might join OPEC.
24:48.260 - 24:53.540:  Well, at this moment, our decision is very clear on this. We are not in any rush or any hurry
24:53.540 - 24:57.880:  to join OPEC. It is not part of our policy, so we are very clear on that.
24:58.320 - 25:03.940:  Okay. Those big oil deposits, they were discovered before you came to power. And some critics have
25:03.940 - 25:07.420:  said that the previous government, when they signed those contracts with Exxon and its partners,
25:07.980 - 25:12.640:  they were too generous. They gave away Guyana's oil riches too cheaply. How true is that?
25:13.260 - 25:18.740:  Well, I would say definitely with the data at the best of deals, Exxon had a good deal. But look,
25:19.080 - 25:24.120:  the sanctity of contract is very important and we can't go back at that. So there'll be no
25:24.220 - 25:30.040:  renegotiating of those contracts. We cannot go back and renegotiate. But what we have done is to
25:30.040 - 25:35.300:  ensure that there are changes. We have already outlined a number of changes in future production
25:35.300 - 25:40.500:  sharing agreements. It will be completely different. We have to ensure that there is great
25:40.500 - 25:46.280:  transparency and accountability and management of the resources using the resources as handouts
25:46.640 - 25:52.200:  in a way that is popular in a short term. But in a long term, it is detrimental for the countries
25:52.200 - 25:56.240:  not the route that we're going to go. Has your government taken measures to ensure accountability
25:56.240 - 26:00.920:  and transparency? Yes, so that is what I'll explain. So first of all, we have set up the natural
26:00.920 - 26:07.320:  resources fund. That fund is governed separate and apart from the executive. Secondly, we have set
26:07.320 - 26:13.240:  in the law a condition that if the Minister of Finance does not declare the revenue that has been
26:13.240 - 26:18.300:  paid into the fund within a stipulated time from receiving that revenue, he can face up to 10 years
26:18.300 - 26:24.020:  in prison. That is in the law. All the resources that it's used from the fund to be invested in
26:24.020 - 26:28.360:  the country has to pass through the parliamentary system and get parliamentary approval.
26:28.940 - 26:34.960:  Are you worried that Guyana simply doesn't have enough people to really take advantage of this
26:35.240 - 26:41.400:  bananza that you've been given by oil and gas? I mean, just to explain for listeners who don't
26:41.400 - 26:46.080:  necessarily know Guyana, it's a country around the size of the United Kingdom and yet it has a
26:46.080 - 26:51.620:  population of less than one million people. Definitely our population is going to be a hindrance
26:51.620 - 26:57.840:  to development. We're already in a situation in the country where we have a tremendous shortage
26:57.840 - 27:02.280:  in the supply of labor. The companies in the private sector complaining now even government
27:02.280 - 27:08.460:  contractors are having great difficulties in sourcing labor. So what are we doing? So if you
27:08.460 - 27:13.040:  have launched a scholarship program through which every Guyana is can have access to higher levels
27:13.040 - 27:18.280:  of education. So you'll be training Guy and E's workers, will you also be importing foreign workers?
27:19.040 - 27:24.840:  Oh, definitely. We are seeing already a tremendous request for the importation of labor
27:24.840 - 27:29.860:  to fill the gap that exists. There's an irony here, isn't there, that Guyana has found all of this
27:29.860 - 27:36.600:  oil and gas in its water just as the world is moving away from oil. As I speak to you, 53%
27:36.700 - 27:42.740:  of the world energy mix comes from oil and gas. But if we are to achieve the full commitment,
27:42.740 - 27:49.960:  you're looking at 35 to 40% of world energy mix still coming from oil and gas. So I don't see
27:49.960 - 27:56.800:  an immediate medium term end to oil and gas. That was Guyana's president, Irfan Ali.
27:57.700 - 28:03.400:  Finally, tennis and Novak Djokovic has moved one step closer to being legitimately called
28:03.400 - 28:09.420:  the greatest player of all time. The Serbia won the U.S. Open in New York to secure his 24th
28:09.620 - 28:15.700:  Grand Slam title, beating Russia's Daniel Medvedev in straight sets after a nail-biting time break
28:15.700 - 28:21.960:  in the second. The 36-year-old now stands at the top of the record list, tying Margaret court
28:21.960 - 28:27.300:  for the most Grand Slam's titles ever. With more, here's the BBC's tennis correspondent Russell
28:27.300 - 28:32.480:  Fuller. He lay down at one moment on the court in the middle of a game just to try and fill his
28:32.480 - 28:37.360:  lungs with air. He looked shattered. I think he genuinely was very, very tired. He was trying to
28:37.360 - 28:42.420:  keep the points as short as he possibly could. He was regularly stretching his leg muscles in
28:42.420 - 28:47.780:  between points, but yet he still managed to win it, saved a set point, won it in a tie break.
28:48.220 - 28:53.400:  And at that moment, you could just see mentally it was going to be incredibly difficult for Daniel
28:53.400 - 28:58.140:  Medvedev to come back. And in contrast to the second set, Djokovic won the first set relatively
28:58.140 - 29:03.740:  easy by six games to three. He played a brilliant first set, serving in volley in quite a lot,
29:03.740 - 29:08.940:  taking advantage of the fact that Medvedev likes to return, serve about eight or nine metres behind
29:08.940 - 29:15.360:  the baseline. So an extraordinary strategic performance by Djokovic and to have the endurance
29:15.360 - 29:20.740:  at the age of 36 to win the second set in the way he did and complete victory in straight sets
29:21.160 - 29:25.940:  is just another remarkable achievement. Do you think Medvedev will be slightly disappointed in
29:25.940 - 29:31.320:  how he played in the first set in particular? He started very, very slowly. He played a lot,
29:31.320 - 29:36.300:  lot better in that second set and clearly it could have gone either way. He's a stubborn man
29:36.300 - 29:40.760:  and he admits he can be a stubborn man. This position he takes that I was describing, it really
29:40.760 - 29:45.860:  is a long, long way behind the baseline. It does make it easier for somebody, you're opponent to
29:45.860 - 29:50.120:  come forward and dominate the court, but he's had a lot of success from that position. As Raffa
29:50.120 - 29:55.820:  Nadal has done over the years because he does have a powerful and a deep return, but even Medvedev
29:55.820 - 29:59.820:  admitted later that perhaps he was a little bit stubborn and he should have tried to move a little
29:59.820 - 30:05.140:  bit close to the baseline to put pressure on Djokovic. Medvedev didn't play nearly as well as he did
30:05.140 - 30:09.560:  in the semi-final against Carlos Alcarae, where he was just outstanding. And of course a lot of
30:09.560 - 30:14.960:  that does have a lot to do with the opponent. That was Russell Fuller speaking to Rick Edwards.
30:17.060 - 30:20.840:  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new version of the Global News podcast
