*01:04.920- 01:07.660* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:10.280- 01:13.280* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Thursday, the 28th of September,
*01:13.280- 01:14.380* :  these are our main stories.
*01:14.860- 01:18.600* :  The American soldier, Travis King, who fled to North Korea in July,
*01:18.600- 01:22.680* :  is back in US custody after being expelled by Pyongyang.
*01:23.320- 01:25.840* :  The US State Department says it will work with allies
*01:25.840- 01:28.940* :  to set up a monitoring mission for Nagorno-Karabakh.
*01:29.300- 01:32.160* :  And police in Brazil have carried out fresh raids and arrests
*01:32.160- 01:35.980* :  in connection with riots carried out by supporters of the former president,
*01:36.380- 01:38.760* :  Jaya Bolsonaro, after he left office.
*01:41.720- 01:45.880* :  Also in this podcast, we meet the scientists working on the mysteries of antimatter.
*01:46.460- 01:49.560* :  Obviously, if it went up, there's a Nobel Prize, right?
*01:49.920- 01:52.300* :  It goes down, everyone says, yeah, I told you so.
*01:52.580- 01:55.620* :  But the work isn't over. There's wiggle room right now.
*01:59.000- 02:04.220* :  We stung it with a prisoner release that reads a bit like a scene straight out of a cold war movie.
*02:04.480- 02:08.640* :  It seems to have taken the intervention of China, Swedish facilitators,
*02:09.020- 02:10.420* :  and the approval of North Korea.
*02:10.880- 02:13.460* :  But now, Travis King is back in US custody.
*02:14.300- 02:19.200* :  Here's the American soldier who ran across the border from South Korea into the North in July.
*02:19.200- 02:22.720* :  He was facing military disciplinary procedures at the time.
*02:23.440- 02:26.100* :  Matthew Miller is the spokesman for the US State Department.
*02:26.780- 02:29.820* :  The United States has secured the return of private Travis King
*02:29.820- 02:32.140* :  from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
*02:32.640- 02:35.400* :  He was transported to the border between North Korea and China,
*02:35.400- 02:39.560* :  where he was met by our ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Nicholas Burns.
*02:40.280- 02:45.500* :  He then boarded a State Department op-med plane and flew from Dandong, China to Xinjiang, China,
*02:46.000- 02:49.380* :  and then on from Xinjiang to Osan Air Force Base in South Korea,
*02:49.760- 02:51.480* :  where he was transferred to the Department of Defense.
*02:52.300- 02:55.880* :  We appreciate the professionalism of our diplomats who worked with their counterparts
*02:55.880- 03:00.140* :  of the Department of Defense and coordinated with the governments of Sweden and the People's
*03:00.140- 03:04.560* :  Republic of China. And we thank Sweden and the People's Republic of China for their assistance
*03:04.560- 03:06.240* :  in facilitating that transfer.
*03:07.000- 03:10.840* :  As we recall this podcast, Travis King is now said to be on his way to the US.
*03:11.740- 03:15.760* :  Pyongyang says it deported Mr. King for entering the country illegally,
*03:15.760- 03:20.340* :  though added that he had fled there because of poor treatment in the US army.
*03:20.720- 03:24.740* :  Michael Bristo, our Asia-Pacific editor, told me why he'd been released now.
*03:25.380- 03:28.520* :  It's difficult to say because North Korea haven't told us,
*03:28.520- 03:35.120* :  but they've probably got as much of a propaganda coup or value out of Travis King,
*03:35.540- 03:36.720* :  as they're ever going to have.
*03:37.200- 03:41.040* :  They've already announced that they've had an investigation into why he came across the
*03:41.040- 03:44.940* :  board when they said it's because of discrimination, even racial discrimination he faced
*03:44.980- 03:49.060* :  within the US army, so a pop at the United States there.
*03:49.640- 03:55.100* :  They also, by giving back Travis King, get some credit from the Americans,
*03:55.100- 03:59.020* :  because remember, these are two countries without diplomatic ties.
*03:59.020- 04:02.240* :  You couldn't think of a more strange relationship in the world, and yet,
*04:02.640- 04:08.420* :  North Korea is collaborated, handed back a US soldier, so that gives them some credit with the
*04:08.420- 04:12.560* :  Americans, and perhaps suggesting the future that they could talk about other issues.
*04:12.840- 04:17.740* :  And it's not surprising, perhaps, that this man didn't go back over the border from North
*04:17.740- 04:23.180* :  Korea to the South, given that Pyongyang was only saying the day before yesterday, that
*04:23.700- 04:28.340* :  the peninsula is on the verge of a nuclear conflagation. That's probably why they put
*04:28.340- 04:33.200* :  them back to China. Probably is, but also the border between North and South Korea is
*04:33.660- 04:37.880* :  really heavily fortified. There's only one place where you can actually go across safely,
*04:37.880- 04:42.160* :  and that's the place where he escaped through. It's a village called Panmunjom,
*04:42.660- 04:46.900* :  which is a truce village, essentially, so there's no guns there, so that's how he's able to get
*04:46.900- 04:53.460* :  across. China has often been the root out of North Korea, foreign North Koreans from everybody,
*04:54.000- 04:58.200* :  leaving North Korea. I went to North Korea a few years ago, and you went in through Beijing.
*04:58.200- 05:06.140* :  So to come through China is perhaps understandable, but again, diplomatically, the United States and
*05:06.140- 05:12.140* :  China, and in a good place at the moment, and the corporation China's shown also indicates that
*05:12.140- 05:17.580* :  perhaps there's somewhere for those two countries, the United States and China, to talk about other
*05:17.580- 05:22.080* :  issues. It's so difficult, isn't it, to read the roots about where these different relationships
*05:22.580- 05:27.740* :  are going, and it takes incidents like this, to actually highlight that, and see how
*05:27.740- 05:34.520* :  convoluted it all is. What's your impression about what North Korea's long-term goal is?
*05:34.780- 05:39.680* :  Just to take your first point there, the convoluted nature of these negotiations to get
*05:39.680- 05:44.320* :  Travis King out must have been incredible, and perhaps why there's been so much secrecy
*05:44.320- 05:49.100* :  surrounding them, up until he was actually out of the country. You're talking about three countries,
*05:49.100- 05:53.760* :  North Korea, China, the United States, really are odds with each other. So to come together and
*05:54.120- 05:59.220* :  arrange anything, it's really quite extraordinary. North Korea's long-term goal, I don't think this
*05:59.220- 06:05.440* :  really changes much. I just think it was an easy way for them to get a win really, to do something
*06:05.440- 06:11.520* :  good for the Americans, perhaps down the line, the last for something in return, keeping this in their
*06:11.520- 06:17.140* :  back pocket. Michael Brista, the US State Department says it will work with allies on an international
*06:17.140- 06:23.340* :  monitoring team for Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan took control of the territory during an
*06:23.340- 06:29.560* :  overwhelming offensive last week. Azerbaijan has promised to respect the rights of all ethnic
*06:29.560- 06:35.520* :  Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, but more than a third have now fled. One former leader of the
*06:35.520- 06:42.140* :  territory, Ruben Vardanyan, was detained by Azerbaijan forces as he tried to leave. The billionaire
*06:42.140- 06:46.320* :  banker was head of the separatist government for several months until February this year.
*06:47.000- 06:52.160* :  The BBC's Sarah Reinsford is in Armenia, speaking to the people arriving from across the border.
*06:52.880- 06:57.160* :  It's walking down this street and it is lined with cars and everyone of them.
*06:57.920- 07:04.820* :  As a family from Nagorno-Karabakh, there's a woman here, heavily pregnant and she's just leaning
*07:05.360- 07:10.620* :  against the wall and crying. There's a car right next to me here with bundles of blankets
*07:11.060- 07:16.340* :  piled on the refract and a big bike on top of it. The ground is in the back.
*07:17.240- 07:18.380* :  It's actually trying to make a cup of tea.
*07:24.100- 07:29.360* :  We are from Stepanakert. The road out was tough, very stressful. It took two days.
*07:29.580- 07:38.300* :  There was a really big queue. The whole of Karabakh is living. I cry now all day long. We left
*07:38.300- 07:53.080* :  everything. Four houses, everything. Not far from me. Beautiful, comedian, church, at the foot
*07:53.480- 07:59.700* :  of the mountain is the main reception point for refugees here in Goros and there are crowds of
*07:59.720- 08:05.120* :  people everywhere. There are many buses standing by ready to take people to different corners of
*08:05.120- 08:12.440* :  this country. It's all quite calm but the mood here is depressed. There's a people who are
*08:12.620- 08:15.540* :  leaving behind everything and heading into the unknown.
*08:19.520- 08:25.360* :  We are students in high school and we help people because they're coming.
*08:25.360- 08:34.900* :  We are calling for those who see sweet, sweet, sweet coffee for people who are not as tough.
*08:35.760- 08:39.400* :  So you live here in Goros and you saw what was happening and you wanted to help.
*08:40.420- 08:43.320* :  Have you been about seeing all these people coming from Karabakh?
*08:44.060- 08:47.860* :  We don't know what to do.
*08:52.780- 08:57.420* :  I've been trying to speak to some of the men here who fought to defend Nagorno-Karabakh but
*08:57.420- 09:01.920* :  nobody wants to comment publicly. One of them just said that he wouldn't speak because after
*09:01.920- 09:08.080* :  all of these years fighting to defend the right to be in that enclave, they'd lost and he said
*09:08.820- 09:09.740* :  he was ashamed of that.
*09:11.240- 09:21.700* :  In the central square here in Goros, there's just been a big delivery of aid.
*09:23.540- 09:33.520* :  There's boxes full of sweets and puddings. We are being told that the authorities here in Armenia are coping.
*09:33.520- 09:38.540* :  My name is Varajasani and some representing the Ministry of Economy of Armenia.
*09:38.900- 09:45.280* :  When it comes to the responsibility that the government and myself are carrying on is to
*09:45.280- 09:50.400* :  organize logistically to feed these people. This is the first priority.
*09:54.100- 09:59.340* :  Back up here at the border crossing there are still lots and lots of cars coming across.
*09:59.520- 10:03.740* :  A van just passed with a fridge freezer strapped to the roof.
*10:08.860- 10:15.900* :  It's nearly dusk here and I'm looking over towards the mountains of Karabakh now and I can see
*10:15.900- 10:20.420* :  a long line of those cars sneaking into the distance still.
*10:23.800- 10:26.260* :  That report by Sarah Reinsford in Armenia.
*10:26.940- 10:31.640* :  Brazilian police have been carrying out fresh raids and arrests as they continue to investigate
*10:31.640- 10:36.740* :  the January 8th riots in Brazil. The violence took place a week after the
*10:36.740- 10:40.720* :  defeated president Jair Bolsonaro left office. Leonardo Roshra reports.
*10:41.180- 10:46.120* :  A police statement said three arrest warrants were issued as well as ten search and seizure
*10:46.120- 10:52.140* :  warrants in four Brazilian states. The suspect haven't been named but Brazilian media say one of
*10:52.140- 10:57.720* :  the warrants is for a man who made an infamous online broadcast from the chair of a Supreme Court
*10:57.720- 11:03.800* :  judge during the riots. The violence took the country by surprise. Supporters of Mr. Bolsonaro
*11:03.800- 11:08.660* :  had been camping in the outskirts of Brazil for weeks seeing the elections had been rigged.
*11:08.960- 11:14.100* :  Suddenly thousands of them gathered outside congress and for hours vandalized government buildings
*11:14.100- 11:19.720* :  calling for a military coup. Mr. Bolsonaro has been investigated but denies any involvement.
*11:20.740- 11:21.560* :  Leonardo Roshra
*11:22.560- 11:27.380* :  Scientists have made an important discovery about a mysterious substance which could hold the
*11:27.380- 11:32.320* :  key to explaining how the universe began. For years physicists have been trying to find out
*11:32.320- 11:36.720* :  whether so-called anti-matter responds to gravity in the same way as its opposite
*11:37.280- 11:42.840* :  matter from which everything around us is made. Researchers have finally been able to test this
*11:42.840- 11:48.460* :  after creating thousands of atoms of anti-matter and especially built facility at Europe's
*11:48.460- 11:54.700* :  Particle Research Center, CERN. Our science correspondent Palab Gosh was given exclusive access
*11:54.700- 12:04.640* :  to the laboratory in Switzerland. Scientists grumble as an alert sounds at the anti-matter lab.
*12:05.040- 12:09.220* :  Anti-matter is just the coolest, most mysterious stuff you can imagine.
*12:09.780- 12:12.560* :  The coolest stuff is getting a little too warm.
*12:14.920- 12:21.680* :  Professor Jeffrey Hanks and his team had liquid helium to keep it almost as cold as cold can be.
*12:22.140- 12:25.360* :  Absolute zero. The temperature of outer space.
*12:25.360- 12:31.220* :  As far as we understand you can build a universe like you and me made of just anti-matter.
*12:31.700- 12:38.100* :  To me that's just inspiring to address one of the most fundamental open questions about what
*12:38.100- 12:44.240* :  this stuff is and how it behaves. For answers Jeffrey has built what he calls his anti-matter factory.
*12:45.260- 12:51.240* :  We're in the center of the ring that provides us with the anti-matter. This is the place at CERN
*12:51.240- 12:55.960* :  where they provide us with the anti-particles that we need to do our experiments.
*12:56.400- 13:01.660* :  Our world is built of tiny particles called atoms, the simplest of which is hydrogen,
*13:02.380- 13:05.880* :  which is made from a proton and an electron orbiting it.
*13:09.440- 13:16.260* :  In the control room researchers are collecting anti-protons and anti-electrons created by particle
*13:16.260- 13:21.960* :  accelerators at CERN and then mixing them to create anti-hydrogen atoms.
*13:21.960- 13:29.460* :  We're doing those accumulating atoms and after some hours we'll actually do an experiment with them.
*13:29.580- 13:32.340* :  These particles are traveling at the speed of light.
*13:32.760- 13:39.300* :  We have to slow it down with these very complicated machines in order to get it to a stage where we
*13:39.300- 13:43.860* :  can catch it. The anti-matter is then trapped in a magnetic field.
*13:44.380- 13:46.020* :  88,000 mixing triggers.
*13:46.440- 13:51.440* :  The team turn off the magnet to see if the anti-hydrogen falls up or down.
*13:52.040- 13:55.600* :  If it's up it would revolutionize our understanding of physics.
*13:55.600- 14:03.560* :  We found that anti-matter falls towards the earth in the same way that equivalent matter would.
*14:03.920- 14:05.720* :  Is that not a bit of a disappointing result?
*14:07.120- 14:11.080* :  Well obviously if it went up there's a Nobel Prize, right?
*14:11.680- 14:15.800* :  There goes down everyone says yeah I told you so but the work isn't over.
*14:16.220- 14:17.820* :  There's wiggle room right now.
*14:18.760- 14:24.440* :  Jeffrey's wiggle room is that the anti-hydrogen may fall at a slightly different rate to hydrogen.
*14:25.120- 14:28.280* :  If that's the case then he may still get his Nobel Prize.
*14:29.200- 14:35.120* :  That's because any difference in matter and anti-matter could explain why the universe is the way it is.
*14:35.600- 14:39.200* :  According to Dr. Danielle Hodgkinson of the anti-matter team.
*14:39.600- 14:44.260* :  You might ask yourself how do we live in this universe which appears to be almost entirely
*14:44.260- 14:49.720* :  dominated by matter. This is what motivates our experiments. We measure the fundamental
*14:49.720- 14:55.700* :  properties of anti-matter and that might be a clue towards how our theories need to re-revised.
*14:58.440- 15:00.900* :  Curiously writing equations on a blackboard,
*15:01.380- 15:05.900* :  Sirnds, Dr. Erin Van Zueiler, is a physicist pondering those theories.
*15:06.000- 15:09.740* :  She's among many who are eagerly awaiting the next set of results.
*15:10.360- 15:16.860* :  Everything that is new and that especially goes against what we think it must happen is super
*15:16.860- 15:21.320* :  interesting because in me then we'll have to change something and change is unfunbastic.
*15:24.140- 15:29.680* :  The scientists, the anti-matter lab, continue their work knowing that the current theory does have
*15:29.680- 15:35.000* :  to change and they want to be the ones to make that happen in order to answer one of the biggest
*15:35.000- 15:41.740* :  questions why the universe exists at all. Palab ghost at Europe's Particle Research Center in
*15:41.740- 15:48.980* :  Switzerland. Still to come. On the shelf with this magical collection of dusty,
*15:48.980- 15:56.100* :  kind of greeny blue bottles with this little shelf sign saying Learcastle Whiskey, cast 1833.
*15:56.640- 16:02.800* :  Now there is a rare opportunity to find for what some connoisseurs say could be the oldest Scotch
*16:02.800- 16:13.380* :  Whiskey in existence. The attacker had very good knowledge of banking systems.
*16:13.680- 16:18.280* :  $3.1 billion in stolen funds. Money laundering operations. The cybercriminal group.
*16:18.320- 16:23.560* :  He's a smart guy. Season one and two of the Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service are
*16:23.560- 16:29.560* :  available in full right now following the twists and turns in the incredible story of the Lazarus
*16:29.560- 16:34.200* :  group hackers. The Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service catch up with the whole series now
*16:34.200- 16:42.400* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Back now to the Global News Podcast. The European Court
*16:42.400- 16:46.840* :  of Human Rights on Wednesday heard a case brought by a group of children and young adults from
*16:46.840- 16:51.740* :  Portugal who accused governments in Europe of failing to do enough to stop global warming.
*16:51.740- 16:56.660* :  They want the court in Strasbourg to force more than 30 governments to cut emissions.
*16:56.780- 17:01.480* :  The young people say global warming threatens their physical and mental well-being,
*17:01.480- 17:04.960* :  citing the heat waves and wildfires in Portugal in recent years.
*17:05.640- 17:08.680* :  Some governments say the court doesn't have jurisdiction over them.
*17:09.040- 17:13.060* :  Others say those bringing the case have failed to prove they're directly affected.
*17:13.060- 17:18.780* :  But their case is gathering popular momentum with support from campaign groups and celebrities.
*17:19.260- 17:22.480* :  The BBC has spoken to one of the young people involved in the case.
*17:22.480- 17:27.540* :  Mariana is 11 and her thoughts are translated by her older sister, Claudia.
*17:28.060- 17:32.960* :  She said that she was involved in this because she wants to protect her future.
*17:33.400- 17:40.880* :  And I think that having this conscience at her age she's only 11 and she already knows that
*17:40.880- 17:47.860* :  if we continue in this path that she won't have a good life. I think it's amazing but also it's
*17:48.060- 17:54.020* :  very boring. Why does she have to be worried about this? She should be just playing with her friends
*17:54.020- 17:56.140* :  and doing TikToks.
*17:56.760- 18:02.500* :  Professor Sonja Senna Verrattne is a specialist in extreme climate events at the Institute
*18:02.500- 18:07.980* :  for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich. Julian Marshall asked her if she thinks
*18:07.980- 18:12.960* :  governments and guilty as charged by these young people and that they're not doing enough
*18:12.960- 18:18.560* :  to combat climate change. It's certainly correct if you look at the last IPCC report.
*18:18.560- 18:23.680* :  We know that basically most countries of the world have signed the Paris Agreement which
*18:24.160- 18:29.400* :  has as is aimed to basically limit global warming if possible to 1.5 degree.
*18:29.960- 18:36.080* :  And what we know clearly from the current emissions is that we actually not on track.
*18:36.080- 18:38.960* :  It's clear we need more action if we want to have a chance.
*18:39.560- 18:46.560* :  And if that doesn't happen are these young people right to be fair for the consequences of
*18:46.560- 18:52.960* :  climate change in the future? Yes, I definitely right. I would say already now we do see
*18:52.960- 18:58.560* :  consequences of a human induced climate change. There are already now people dying of
*18:58.560- 19:04.660* :  human induced climate change during heat waves for instance and we do know from the IPCC reports
*19:04.660- 19:10.500* :  that with any fraction of additional global warming we have a lot of increased
*19:11.000- 19:18.740* :  for instance extreme events in several regions of the world and the risk for many impacts
*19:18.740- 19:25.020* :  would be substantially larger at 2 degree compared to 1.5 degree including some irreversible
*19:25.020- 19:33.460* :  impacts. And will this process of global warming will it accelerate if the action that
*19:33.460- 19:39.100* :  climate scientists and others want governments to take is not taken?
*19:39.640- 19:44.880* :  So what we can say is it's more of a gradual change but what we have is that the situation
*19:44.940- 19:50.220* :  is getting worse and worse year after year because we have a problem of accumulation of the
*19:50.220- 19:57.420* :  greenhouse gas in the atmosphere especially CO2 is a very long live greenhouse gas and that's
*19:57.420- 20:02.820* :  the main issue we're dealing with which is that the situation is getting worse with every additional
*20:02.820- 20:08.940* :  emission of CO2. I mean this legal action is directed principally against
*20:09.900- 20:17.160* :  European Union member states but even if they were to take the kind of action that is necessary
*20:17.160- 20:25.900* :  to limit temperatures to 1.5 degrees centigrade it still leaves India it still leaves China it
*20:25.900- 20:32.320* :  still leaves the United States out there does it not? It does but in the end as mentioned
*20:32.320- 20:39.320* :  every emission matters so we have to stand somewhere and there is this possibility here in Europe
*20:39.320- 20:47.100* :  to have such a cold case what is clear is in terms of historical responsibility both the U.S.
*20:47.100- 20:52.700* :  and most of the European countries have historical responsibility because they have been responsible
*20:52.700- 20:57.880* :  for a lot of the CO2 that has been accumulated on the other end obviously we need also to have
*20:57.880- 21:03.700* :  reduction of emissions in other countries but every country needs to make its contribution and
*21:04.220- 21:09.280* :  if we can reduce emissions in Europe this would be already a substantial improvement.
*21:10.140- 21:17.760* :  Professor Sonja Sena Veratne from the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich.
*21:18.300- 21:24.960* :  The Biden administration has formally admitted Israel into its visa waiver program the move comes
*21:24.960- 21:31.340* :  after years of negotiations more from Barbara Pletasha. Starting on November 30th Israelis will be
*21:31.340- 21:36.960* :  able to travel to the U.S. for trips up to 90 days without needing a visa. The Biden administration
*21:36.960- 21:42.060* :  said it approved the arrangement after Israel lifted travel restrictions on Palestinian Americans.
*21:42.900- 21:47.200* :  Those resident in the occupied territories had been banned from Israel's main airport
*21:47.200- 21:52.080* :  but now they can use it and they can visit Israel without a permit as tourists.
*21:52.900- 21:57.380* :  But some democratic senators have expressed concern that Palestinian Americans still face
*21:57.380- 22:02.620* :  discrimination and an Arab American rights group is seeking to block the decision in court.
*22:03.240- 22:06.780* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has welcomed the move.
*22:09.100- 22:14.600* :  Only about 40 of the world's countries are exempt from visas and now Israel has also joined
*22:14.600- 22:20.280* :  the list. This decision is further evidence of the strong ties between Israel and the U.S.A.
*22:20.660- 22:25.140* :  I would like to express our deep gratitude to the U.S. President Joe Biden for his support
*22:25.140- 22:28.780* :  for the move which will further strengthen the ties between our nations.
*22:29.540- 22:32.280* :  To France now where in what's thought to be a world first,
*22:32.280- 22:37.320* :  Paris City Council has announced it will subsidise health insurance for pets.
*22:38.180- 22:45.940* :  For around $65 a year owners in the city can top their own medical care up to cover cats and dogs.
*22:46.780- 22:51.220* :  The scheme has proved very popular indeed and now councillors and animal rights activists
*22:51.220- 22:55.620* :  are also debating whether other pets, including rats, should be covered too.
*22:55.860- 23:01.380* :  Evan Davis spoke to Catherine Nicholson, the European affairs editor at France 24,
*23:01.380- 23:06.140* :  who's also a cat owner and lives in Paris. Paris really is the city that loves its pets.
*23:06.800- 23:12.380* :  There are actually more pets per Perisians than there are pets per Londoners and this is something
*23:12.380- 23:18.980* :  that was voted in unanimously by the Paris councillors in July and they're hoping that they'll be
*23:18.980- 23:24.540* :  able to bring it in next year and the idea is that city hall thinks that Perisian pets suffer
*23:25.080- 23:30.980* :  in particular ways that are more than other places around France. They suffer environmental stress,
*23:31.420- 23:36.300* :  so they're talking about things like air pollution which certainly is a measurable problem in Paris.
*23:36.840- 23:42.840* :  Things like illnesses passed on by rats, we have a massive rust problem in Paris, cats falling
*23:42.840- 23:48.760* :  out of windows, sadly so many of us live on six and seventh floors and then other things like
*23:48.760- 23:53.800* :  apartment dwelling animals getting overweight and then getting all the problems that we know about
*23:53.800- 23:58.480* :  like joint problems diabetes, that sort of thing. So they're all going to offer this just for
*23:58.580- 24:03.460* :  Perisian pets. And it's effectively, it goes on your health insurance. You the government
*24:03.460- 24:08.120* :  pay most of your bill but you generally have a top-up insurance policy to cover some of it.
*24:08.300- 24:12.780* :  They will sort out a price that you will pay on your health insurance for your pet.
*24:13.460- 24:17.900* :  That's right, so the idea is that this is going to be massively cheaper than the private
*24:17.900- 24:22.340* :  pet insurance offers that already exist. Like a barma care for pets.
*24:24.040- 24:29.380* :  A barma care for pets, but they might steal that slogan. They say on average a cat and dog
*24:29.380- 24:36.060* :  in, in short in France, the owner will spend more than 500 euros a year. Now the communist party
*24:36.060- 24:40.840* :  counselor who's proposing this says he's hoping to have it available for between 10 and 60 euros
*24:40.840- 24:46.060* :  per year which just seems incredibly ambitious but he says that because of the sheer number
*24:46.060- 24:51.340* :  of cat and dog owners in Paris, he's confident that they are going to be able to get an offer
*24:51.340- 24:56.620* :  from an insurance company that gets it down for that cost. Catherine Nicholson, the European
*24:56.620- 25:03.880* :  affairs editor at France 24. Next to the world of video games. It's been a name synonymous with
*25:03.880- 25:10.260* :  this genre and specifically football for over 30 years but now the best-selling franchise FIFA
*25:10.920- 25:17.540* :  is changing its branding to EA Sports FC, the new incarnation hits the shelves this week.
*25:18.400- 25:24.020* :  LeQuessa Burak spoke to the BBC's gaming correspondent Stefan Powell and asked him why the name
*25:24.020- 25:30.820* :  EA Sports FC? It's not quite as catchy as Fancy Game of FIFA which has become synonymous with
*25:30.820- 25:34.640* :  gaming or the last 30 years like it's a 1993 was the first FIFA video game we've seen.
*25:35.180- 25:39.600* :  I think the hope for the short hand is that it becomes FC so they're hoping that in the future
*25:39.600- 25:43.780* :  people say Fancy Game of FC so they get rid of the EA Sports bit. I've been chatting to experts
*25:43.780- 25:49.200* :  in this field it's probably the biggest rebrand attempt in the entertainment industry's history.
*25:49.280- 25:54.020* :  It's somewhat described to me as like rebranding the Bond franchise because of how many people it's
*25:54.020- 25:59.060* :  worth two billion dollars a year, two electronic arts, the company that make the game, 20 million
*25:59.540- 26:05.460* :  people play it every month. It's a BM off in the sort of gaming space. Why they've done it? Well there's
*26:05.460- 26:09.820* :  two reasons, firstly cash. There was sort of a discussion about how much they should be paying for
*26:09.820- 26:14.200* :  the license going forward and they couldn't reach an agreement on that reportedly but also in
*26:14.200- 26:18.660* :  my interviews with EA Sports in the lead up to this game coming out they were saying to me that
*26:18.660- 26:24.360* :  actually it also comes down to control and freedom. By being away from the license of FIFA they can
*26:24.360- 26:30.400* :  decide what is in the game more they can decide who and what brand partnerships they want to do
*26:30.400- 26:34.200* :  in the future which gives them the degree of freedom which they haven't had in the past because
*26:34.200- 26:39.500* :  they've had to do things tied and restricted to the FIFA license. Video games and FIFA
*26:39.500- 26:46.400* :  as in football. How closely are they tied? What do you think about it? For 30 years the major video game
*26:46.400- 26:52.060* :  the people played that replicated football a football simulator was called FIFA and so very
*26:52.060- 26:57.840* :  closely tied. Did they own it? So no electronic arts made the game but it was licensed, the brand,
*26:57.840- 27:03.100* :  the title was licensed to them by FIFA and then through that originally they got access to all the
*27:03.100- 27:09.400* :  player likenesses, all the kits for the football teams, all the stadiums etc etc. But now what they've
*27:09.400- 27:14.660* :  done is they've struck individual agreements with all those different clubs and leagues and
*27:14.660- 27:22.160* :  teams around the world. So it's something like 9000 players and 700 teams, numbers of the
*27:22.220- 27:28.220* :  often top of my head, it's a lot and that approach to the game has been central to why this game has
*27:28.220- 27:32.700* :  been so popular over the years because if I want to play as a bappé I want them to look like a bappé,
*27:32.700- 27:37.140* :  I want them to be as fast as a bappé and I want to feel like I am in encompassing, embodying
*27:37.500- 27:41.260* :  my favourite player and so they've been clever in that they've been able to maintain those
*27:41.260- 27:45.480* :  licenses and likenesses going forward. So even though they're losing the name they're keeping
*27:45.480- 27:50.260* :  hold of arguably what made the game unique in the first place and so popular. The BBC's gaming
*27:50.260- 27:57.120* :  correspondent Stefan Powell. Now to Scotland and fans of a wee dram or a single serving of whiskey
*27:57.540- 28:02.720* :  are getting a once in a lifetime opportunity. They will be able to bid for what is believed by some
*28:02.720- 28:10.500* :  connoisseurs to be the oldest Scotch whiskey in existence. 24 bottles of the single malt dating
*28:10.500- 28:16.840* :  back almost 200 years are being put up for auction. As Bernadette Keoh explains the bottles had
*28:16.840- 28:22.400* :  remained undiscovered for decades in the cellar of a Scottish castle in Perthshire.
*28:22.860- 28:28.220* :  It was an unassuming hiding place for the rarest of tipples tucked away at the back of a
*28:28.220- 28:34.660* :  shelf behind a cellar door at Blair Castle in Perthshire. Fortunately the Victorian whiskey
*28:34.660- 28:41.940* :  distillers were meticulous in leaving a plaque indicating it was produced in 1833. It may even have
*28:41.940- 28:47.340* :  been sipped by Queen Victoria who visited the castle a decade later, staying through weeks
*28:47.340- 28:53.580* :  and developing it said a taste for a whiskey and honey concoction. The current resident trustee,
*28:53.580- 28:58.620* :  Bertie Trouton, couldn't believe what he'd stumbled across. On the shelf with his
*28:59.040- 29:04.940* :  magical collection of dusty, greeny blue bottles with this little shelf sign saying
*29:05.020- 29:12.760* :  Blair Castle whiskey cast 1833 bottle 1841. So I did what anyone would do in my situation. I think
*29:12.780- 29:18.180* :  an opened a bottle. I thought we had to immediately check that it was still as good as the label
*29:18.700- 29:25.200* :  suggested. Scientific testing proved the liquor's age. An expert, Taster, described it as having
*29:25.200- 29:31.800* :  medicinal characteristics without any pronounced peat smoke. 24 bottles will be sold individually
*29:31.800- 29:37.180* :  in November. Others will be kept back to go on display at a new exhibition about the history
*29:37.180- 29:42.860* :  of whiskey distilling at the castle. Bernadette Keo, there's a whole raft of plausible excuses
*29:42.860- 29:47.780* :  available at your disposal if you decide you don't want to spend time with someone. But
*29:47.780- 29:52.820* :  in an attempt to avoid celebrating New Year's Eve with his partner, one man from New South Wales
*29:52.820- 29:59.360* :  in Australia opted for an extremely far-fetched and ultimately costly story. Rebecca Wood reports.
*30:17.420- 30:24.240* :  On December 31, he told his partner he was going to meet his so-called financial guy. Instead,
*30:24.240- 30:29.700* :  he was off to see his lover. To buy time, they sent a text message to Yeare's partner,
*30:30.140- 30:35.920* :  saying he was being held hostage but would be released in the morning. According to local media,
*30:35.920- 30:41.880* :  he later told police it was by a group of unknown Middle Eastern men. Fearing for his welfare,
*30:41.880- 30:48.140* :  his partner contacted the emergency services. But thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money and
*30:48.140- 30:55.460* :  200 hours of police work later, the truth was revealed and he was arrested. A quarters handed him
*30:55.460- 31:02.020* :  a three-year community correction order and told him to pay $10,000 to the police in compensation.
*31:03.020- 31:09.160* :  Magistrate Michael Ong said his abhorrent behaviour was motivated by the least compelling reason
*31:09.160- 31:12.780* :  that he's ever come across. Rebecca Wood reporting.
*31:15.460- 31:19.560* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:19.880- 31:23.900* :  If you want a comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*31:24.020- 31:29.780* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on
*31:29.860- 31:36.440* :  X, formerly known as Twitter at Global NewsPod. This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll,
*31:36.460- 31:41.700* :  the producer was Liam McSheffrey. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nick Barnes. And until next time,
*31:41.980- 31:42.200* :  goodbye.
