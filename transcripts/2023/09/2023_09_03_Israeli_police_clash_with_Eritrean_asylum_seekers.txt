01:34.940 - 01:37.700:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:40.340 - 01:42.400:  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Sunday,
01:42.400 - 01:44.660:  the 3rd of September, these are our main stories.
01:45.320 - 01:49.840:  Israeli police have opened an internal investigation into the use of live fire
01:49.840 - 01:54.600:  when they tried to break up clashes in Tel Aviv between rival groups of Eritrean,
01:54.600 - 01:58.300:  Asylum Seekers, nearly 150 people were injured.
01:59.000 - 02:03.240:  Ihor Kolomoysky, one of Ukraine's richest men who was earlier named
02:03.240 - 02:06.500:  Asus Becht in a fraud and money laundering investigation,
02:07.100 - 02:09.200:  has been ordered to remain in custody for two months.
02:10.000 - 02:14.180:  The Nobel Foundation has cancelled its invitation to the Russian ambassador
02:14.700 - 02:17.760:  for this year's prize ceremonies after widespread criticism.
02:20.760 - 02:23.720:  Also in this podcast, we bring you some tropical rock.
02:29.820 - 02:35.300:  We pay tribute to the American singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett that just died aged 76.
02:38.840 - 02:40.020:  We begin in Israel.
02:43.740 - 02:49.660:  Where there were widespread clashes in Tel Aviv on Saturday, nearly 150 people were injured,
02:50.220 - 02:53.720:  including some police officers when there were violent confrontations
02:53.780 - 02:56.960:  between rival groups of Eritrean Asylum Seekers.
02:57.240 - 03:01.620:  Hundreds of protesters had broken through security barriers at the Eritrean Embassy
03:01.980 - 03:06.200:  to stop a government-sponsored cultural event they'd earlier asked the Israeli authorities
03:06.200 - 03:06.840:  to cancel.
03:07.260 - 03:11.160:  Police in Israel have now opened an investigation into the use of live fire
03:11.160 - 03:12.920:  by officers during the clashes.
03:13.460 - 03:17.620:  Our correspondent in Israel, Yolanael, told me more about the extent of the trouble.
03:18.160 - 03:22.760:  This is really something that seems to have caught the authorities in Israel
03:23.100 - 03:24.140:  very much by surprise.
03:24.600 - 03:29.280:  Really, what happened is that activists opposed to the Eritrean government say that they were
03:29.280 - 03:35.420:  asking the authorities to cancel an embassy event, an event organized by the Eritrean Embassy
03:35.420 - 03:37.560:  that was scheduled for a Saturday afternoon.
03:37.700 - 03:42.520:  Then, according to what we can gather from Israeli media reports, the demonstrators
03:43.120 - 03:46.880:  marched towards this venue where the embassy gathering was supposed to take place
03:47.360 - 03:49.040:  in central Tel Aviv.
03:49.640 - 03:53.000:  At the beginning, police managed to hold them back behind barricades,
03:53.000 - 03:55.040:  but then they managed to break through.
03:55.520 - 03:59.820:  And a statement by the Israeli police said that the officers used their guns
03:59.820 - 04:03.580:  firing them in the air because they felt that their lives were in danger.
04:04.000 - 04:07.640:  And you can see from the videos that were shared on social media that they also actually
04:07.640 - 04:13.900:  street battles between Eritreans opposed to the government, a back in Eritrean,
04:13.900 - 04:16.420:  and those who support the government in their home country.
04:16.760 - 04:20.280:  And so Israeli police say they were trying to separate the two sides here.
04:20.420 - 04:24.800:  Of the Eritrean asylum seekers of which there are 26,000 or so in Israel,
04:25.460 - 04:30.740:  of those who are opposed to the government, why do they say they need to claim asylum in Israel?
04:31.140 - 04:36.200:  The numbers are a bit disputed exactly, but they make up the biggest number of sub-Saharan
04:36.200 - 04:37.520:  Africans who are here.
04:37.900 - 04:41.920:  And most of them arrived illegally years ago, crossing in through Egypt.
04:42.400 - 04:46.840:  Now, the people asylum seekers from Eritrean say they fled danger.
04:46.840 - 04:48.420:  They fled persecution, of course.
04:48.420 - 04:52.860:  We know about the compulsory military conscription under slave-like conditions,
04:52.860 - 04:56.020:  according to some human rights groups, that exist in Eritrean.
04:56.020 - 04:59.260:  It's seen very much as one of the world's most repressive countries.
04:59.260 - 05:05.160:  I mean, there was one man who was talking at the protest about why he was just so very much
05:05.160 - 05:09.940:  against a festival being allowed to take place, organized by the Eritrean embassy.
05:10.460 - 05:14.220:  And he talked about why he had run away from Eritrean in the first place.
05:16.820 - 05:18.220:  Why did we run from our country?
05:18.220 - 05:21.480:  Because of the dictator, President Afewaki.
05:22.060 - 05:24.280:  Why are they celebrating this festival here today?
05:24.280 - 05:28.500:  Why did the Israeli police give them a permit to celebrate this dictator?
05:29.160 - 05:30.880:  We are completely opposed to it.
05:31.580 - 05:35.480:  Actually, there are also Eritreans who do support the government
05:35.520 - 05:41.680:  who are present here in Israel, and they would not appear to be in need of international
05:41.680 - 05:44.800:  protection as refugees, according to UN guidelines.
05:44.820 - 05:49.200:  But because the authorities in Israel and other countries don't really make
05:49.660 - 05:53.820:  differentiations between asylum seekers, they don't ask them detailed questions about
05:53.820 - 05:55.020:  their political affiliations.
05:55.080 - 05:58.340:  They're all just classed as Eritrean asylum seekers.
05:58.340 - 06:00.680:  So that's how we get this situation.
06:01.240 - 06:01.800:  You'll land now.
06:01.800 - 06:04.980:  Well, staying in the region, and doctors have told the BBC
06:04.980 - 06:10.920:  an unarmed Palestinian man shot and left critically wounded as he ran away from Israeli forces
06:11.560 - 06:12.920:  was hit to be killed.
06:13.880 - 06:18.840:  Video of Amid Al-Jarub being struck was widely viewed online,
06:19.240 - 06:22.080:  coming amid a rise in violence in the occupied West Bank.
06:22.900 - 06:25.220:  Israel says its forces lives were endangered.
06:25.980 - 06:28.020:  Our Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman reports.
06:30.620 - 06:33.880:  A gunshot echoes across the street in the occupied West Bank.
06:34.620 - 06:40.220:  This is the sound from mobile phone footage of Amid Al-Jarub, a Palestinian man,
06:40.680 - 06:42.180:  being shot in the back of the head.
06:42.800 - 06:47.200:  He was unarmed, running away from the position of an Israeli military jeep,
06:47.640 - 06:50.360:  and apparently heading to try to help an injured man.
06:52.900 - 06:54.960:  People scream as they see he's hit,
06:55.920 - 06:58.500:  and he is now critically wounded in hospital.
06:59.200 - 07:03.660:  The shooting last week happened during an Israeli military raid with the West Bank again
07:03.940 - 07:05.060:  gripped by violence.
07:05.800 - 07:10.960:  The video was circulated widely online, sparking an outcry from human rights groups.
07:15.320 - 07:20.320:  At the family home, his father, Raleb, holds Amid's youngest child.
07:21.120 - 07:23.360:  They fear he may never come home.
07:26.420 - 07:31.980:  My feeling is that this was a cowardly and cruel act at the same time, says Khaled.
07:32.620 - 07:35.200:  My son was on his way to do a humanitarian act.
07:35.200 - 07:40.420:  He was not carrying a stone or a weapon and had no intention of attacking the army, he says.
07:42.280 - 07:46.520:  This year, the West Bank has been ignited by violence the worst in two decades.
07:47.320 - 07:53.200:  Just days before Amid was shot, Palestinian gunmen killed two Israelis in the nearby town of
07:53.200 - 07:58.880:  Awada. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls this a wave of terrorism in the West Bank,
07:59.580 - 08:02.720:  and the military has again intensified its detention raids.
08:03.440 - 08:08.880:  Troops entered the village of Betar, reportedly to a rest of man who might know the attackers where
08:08.880 - 08:15.440:  about, residents through stones and broken masonry at armoured vehicles, and Israeli snipers took
08:15.440 - 08:20.920:  up positions. The Israeli border police didn't answer questions about why Amid was shot,
08:21.680 - 08:28.220:  but it said its forces used live ammunition in Betar as a violent riot was endangering Troops lives.
08:29.440 - 08:33.900:  The footage is among the clearest documentation in recent years of lethal force
08:33.900 - 08:39.900:  used without what rights groups say is any justification. The last fortnight has seen yet more
08:39.900 - 08:46.060:  Israelis and Palestinians killed as this conflict in the West Bank sinks to depths not seen in two
08:46.060 - 08:54.260:  decades. As for Amid, his younger brothers now see the blood that still stains the street here.
08:54.900 - 09:00.320:  It will be a long wait for another family, unlikely to get any real answers.
09:00.860 - 09:08.820:  Tom Bateman reporting. Lawyers for the Ukrainian oligarch, Eehaw Kolomoysky says he will not post
09:08.820 - 09:15.580:  bail and will appeal against a court order that he beheld in custody for two months. They say he's
09:15.580 - 09:22.280:  now being detained at the security services headquarters in Kiev. He's a suspect in a fraud and
09:22.280 - 09:27.660:  money laundering investigation. In his nightly address, President Zelensky thanked law enforcement
09:27.660 - 09:33.140:  officials for their efforts as he addressed the question of corruption without naming Mr Kolomoysky
09:33.140 - 09:41.500:  directly. Of course, we will protect Ukraine and return freedom to our entire land,
09:41.880 - 09:46.980:  and each of us feels that this will be a Ukraine of different rules. The borders will be the same,
09:46.980 - 09:53.520:  democracy probably just as turbulent, freedom as always, but certainly with no business as usual
09:54.040 - 09:58.260:  for those who robbed Ukraine and put themselves above the law and any rules.
09:58.880 - 10:04.060:  Our correspondent Paul Adams reports from Kiev on the background to the detention of the Ukrainian
10:04.060 - 10:10.280:  oligarch. Eehaw Kolomoysky has been under investigation for some time. Now he's officially named in
10:10.280 - 10:15.460:  connection with a fraud and money laundering case, suspected of moving millions of dollars out of
10:15.460 - 10:21.900:  the country between 2013 and 2020. It's the latest move by a government which says tackling corruption
10:21.900 - 10:27.060:  is one of its highest priorities, and it has personal relevance for President Zelensky.
10:27.440 - 10:32.300:  Mr Kolomoysky owned the TV channel which broadcasts the show in which Mr Zelensky,
10:32.300 - 10:37.860:  then a comedian, played the role of a schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine.
10:38.020 - 10:43.360:  Mr Zelensky has always rejected the notion that he's somehow beholden to the oligarch who gave
10:43.360 - 10:49.580:  him his break. Not everyone is convinced by today's move. Anti-corruption activists fear that Mr
10:49.580 - 10:55.520:  Zelensky is weakening the power of Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau in favor of the state security
10:55.520 - 11:01.380:  service, which they praise for its conduct in the war, but see as highly compromised when it comes to
11:01.380 - 11:07.280:  the issue of tackling graft. Paul Adams, let's stay in Ukraine because on Friday, students went
11:07.280 - 11:13.780:  back to school after a summer break. As the new term begins, pupils and teachers face the deadly
11:13.780 - 11:20.340:  threat of Russian missiles and drones. Vitaly Shepchenko investigates. It was a quiet summer morning
11:20.340 - 11:25.860:  in Romani, a provincial town in northern Ukraine, on Wednesday the 23rd of August.
11:26.420 - 11:31.060:  As the Jana Brokobanko, a local headteacher left for work, she told her husband
11:31.060 - 11:34.220:  she had to hold some meetings to prepare for the new term.
11:34.220 - 11:40.480:  But shortly after 10 o'clock, she was dead, together with her deputy, secretary, and a librarian.
11:41.240 - 11:46.420:  The world killed by a Russian kamikaze drone, which almost completely destroyed their school.
11:46.420 - 11:50.300:  Mrs. Brokobanko's husband Valery is distraught.
11:54.020 - 12:01.340:  When I looked into her eyes, I saw so many plans there. It was my wife's life. She was
12:01.340 - 12:08.100:  there 24-7. She was passionate about that school. I swear there were no military there.
12:09.700 - 12:14.300:  Russian air strikes are a constant danger facing Ukrainian teachers,
12:14.800 - 12:19.060:  children, and parents, as the new school term begins in the 1st of September.
12:19.680 - 12:25.020:  According to the Ukrainian authorities, more than 360 educational establishments have been
12:25.020 - 12:30.380:  completely destroyed and more than 3000 damaged during the war with Russia so far.
12:30.760 - 12:34.680:  To minimize this deadly threat, many students will be studying remotely,
12:35.160 - 12:39.400:  and it is up to the local authorities to decide whether schooling will be conducted in the
12:39.400 - 12:44.540:  classroom or from home. Their decision depends on the security situation in each region,
12:45.020 - 12:47.320:  and on whether schools there have bomb shelters.
12:48.060 - 12:52.780:  The war has had a devastating effect on the qualitative education in Ukraine.
12:52.980 - 13:00.020:  The UN's Children's Agency UNICEF says that Ukrainian children are now not only learning
13:00.020 - 13:06.160:  more slowly, but also beginning to lose what they learned when their schools were fully functioning.
13:06.160 - 13:10.480:  And it has been a while since schools were fully functioning in front-line cities,
13:11.060 - 13:15.840:  such as the Parisian, where remote education has been in place with brief interruptions
13:16.060 - 13:19.920:  since COVID restrictions were introduced back in spring 2020.
13:20.040 - 13:24.460:  Kostia Nthin Samila is a headteacher from the Parisian in eastern Ukraine.
13:27.920 - 13:32.280:  This isn't normal schooling. The children who haven't seen proper schooling for three years,
13:32.280 - 13:37.940:  they are poor, poor children. I dread to think what will happen if this goes on for another year.
13:38.300 - 13:40.880:  I won't even have any idea what to do with those children.
13:43.020 - 13:47.700:  But whatever impact distance learning may have on education in Ukraine, teachers,
13:47.700 - 13:52.260:  officials, and parents all agree that safety comes first.
13:52.260 - 13:58.600:  Vitaly Shepchenko. There has been an abrupt U-turn at the Nobel Prize Foundation
13:58.600 - 14:04.020:  in the Swedish capital Stockholm, in a row over who should be on the guest list for this year's
14:04.020 - 14:10.340:  awards ceremony. The Russian, Belarusian, and Iranian ambassadors to Sweden were all included,
14:10.340 - 14:15.660:  but after a massive outcry, they've all now been disinvited, and it seems to have required
14:15.660 - 14:20.840:  the intervention for rather unexpected figure. I spoke to our Europe regional editor Paul Moss
14:20.840 - 14:24.740:  and asked him how did the Nobel Foundation end up in this tank?
14:25.440 - 14:30.600:  The Nobel Prize Award ceremony is a big deal in Sweden. This is a country known for infomality,
14:30.600 - 14:36.500:  but there you get the full pomp and ceremony with formal dress. I think that might be why Bob
14:36.500 - 14:39.920:  Dilland didn't show up when he was awarded the literature prize a few years ago.
14:40.300 - 14:44.580:  It is standard practice to invite all the ambassadors to Sweden, which includes
14:44.580 - 14:48.220:  controversially this year, the Russian, Belarusian, and Iranian ambassadors,
14:48.220 - 14:53.660:  controversial because of Russia invading Ukraine, Belarus for assisting the invasion,
14:54.300 - 14:58.620:  and Iran for its crackdown on pro-democracy protests, including those women not wearing
14:58.620 - 15:03.800:  the hijab. And this isn't just a matter of keeping things simple, given invites to everyone.
15:03.800 - 15:09.720:  For some, it is actually part of the ethos of the Nobel Prize is to be inclusive Vida Helgerson,
15:09.720 - 15:14.360:  who's the executive director of the Nobel Prize Foundation. She defended the decision,
15:14.860 - 15:20.620:  saying this common approach promotes opportunities to convey the important messages of the Nobel
15:20.620 - 15:25.980:  Prize to everyone. So given that, what prompted the Nobel Foundation's change of mind?
15:26.140 - 15:30.800:  Well, as you said, there was a lot of anger. The Swedish Prime Minister was one of many who weighed
15:30.800 - 15:36.560:  in and said it was important to articulate or isolate Russia in every way, but here's the funny
15:36.560 - 15:42.140:  thing. The Nobel Prize Foundation stood its ground, refused to back down, until much to everyone's
15:42.140 - 15:47.940:  surprise, the king of Sweden joined this chorus of critics. Now bear in mind, this is a man who
15:47.940 - 15:52.700:  does not get involved in controversy if he can help it, but he said he might not attend the
15:52.700 - 15:57.300:  ceremony. Now that seems to have swung it shortly afterwards. The invites to the Russian,
15:57.300 - 16:02.340:  Belarusian, and Iranian ambassadors were all cancelled. It's sort of like Cinderella in reverse
16:02.340 - 16:06.060:  being told, actually, you will not go to the ball. So is that the end of the matter?
16:06.540 - 16:11.240:  No, it is not, and here's why. One of the most eagerly anticipated prizes is the Nobel Peace
16:11.240 - 16:16.060:  Prize, and that is not awarded in Sweden, but next door in Norway in the capital of Oslo,
16:16.080 - 16:19.880:  and so far the ambassadors of Russia, Belarus and Iran are still on the guest list.
16:20.280 - 16:24.400:  Now that is particularly controversial, because one previous winner from Belarus,
16:25.020 - 16:29.620:  Alicia Beliatsky is actually in prison in Belarus, and what most say are trump-tuck charges.
16:30.160 - 16:35.900:  A previous Russian winner of the Nobel Prize, the journalist Murat of Dmitri Murat of only this
16:35.940 - 16:41.620:  week, Russia declared him to be a foreign agent. So a lot of people are saying the Belarusian and
16:41.620 - 16:47.140:  Russian ambassadors have particularly no place being at the peace prize ceremony, given how they've
16:47.140 - 16:52.060:  treated past winners, and they're calling on Norway to follow Sweden's lead and to disinvite them.
16:52.540 - 16:58.280:  Our Europe Regional Editor, Paul Moss. The American former diplomat, Bill Richardson,
16:58.280 - 17:03.900:  has died at the age of 75. The Democrat congressman made his name negotiating the release
17:03.900 - 17:07.940:  of Americans held abroad. Simon Ponsford looks back at his life.
17:08.420 - 17:14.140:  Bill Richardson spent decades seeking freedom for Americans at the mercy of repressive regimes,
17:14.140 - 17:20.620:  from Iraq to Cuba to North Korea. Faced to face with the likes of Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro,
17:20.620 - 17:26.160:  he persuaded them to hand over their prisoners. Bill Richardson said the first rule of negotiating
17:26.160 - 17:31.620:  was to know what makes people tick and let the other sides save face. President Bill Clinton
17:31.620 - 17:37.380:  liked his death diplomacy and made him America's invoys of the United Nations. Bill Richardson's
17:37.380 - 17:43.240:  foundation said the world had lost a champion for those held unjustly abroad. Simon Ponsford,
17:43.560 - 17:48.620:  you're listening to the Global News Podcast. Bike theft is one of the most common crimes in the
17:48.620 - 17:53.380:  world, and the problem is especially rampant in cities where cycling is popular. This includes
17:53.380 - 17:59.880:  the city of Ulu in Finland, where 10% of the town's 200,000 residents were victims of bike theft
17:59.880 - 18:04.760:  last year. Local police say bike theft is not a priority, so a group of frustrated
18:04.760 - 18:10.800:  citizens have decided to take matters into their own hands. Edeka Benka joined them on one of their
18:10.800 - 18:18.100:  patrols searching for stolen bikes. So today I'm volunteering with Ilka and trying to find stolen
18:18.100 - 18:24.320:  bikes. So your best friends bike with stolen from the school year? Yeah, so now she doesn't have a
18:24.320 - 18:31.300:  bike. Ulu, there is many students. It's expensive in Finland when your student doesn't have a lot
18:31.300 - 18:39.480:  of income, so it's sad that they get stolen. Last year almost 2,000 bikes were stolen in Ulu,
18:39.560 - 18:48.320:  a city of 200,000 just below the Arctic Circle. Cycling is popular here. In the summer, 77% of
18:48.320 - 18:54.840:  people use their bikes to get from A to B. It's easy and it's safe. The terrain is flat,
18:54.840 - 19:01.560:  and the city has 1,000 kilometers of dedicated bicycle paths. The biggest network in Finland.
19:02.240 - 19:12.060:  We found a bike from Kakri, Ulu. There was two 14 years old boys who has stolen it, so they
19:12.060 - 19:18.300:  just turn away and police ask to give the bike to Ben. So we've now come to the police station
19:18.300 - 19:23.020:  to hand over the bike, the stolen bike to the police, and they will deal with it now. Yes.
19:24.040 - 19:31.000:  Bike theft is not a priority for the police. They told us they concentrated on crimes against life
19:31.000 - 19:37.660:  and health. The police would not even confirm how many stolen bikes they managed to find in Ulu.
19:38.780 - 19:44.120:  They don't have free sources, they don't have time. This is Tina Ursula, a former nurse. She's
19:44.160 - 19:51.060:  out with Olivia, collecting abandoned bicycles. Was in the forest? Yes. We just dumped in the
19:51.060 - 19:56.900:  forest. Yeah. It looks like it's in a good shape, so we are not taking this bike back to its owner.
19:58.400 - 20:04.820:  Is it your son's bike? How old are you? And your bike was stolen. One month ago.
20:05.160 - 20:09.460:  So it needs a bit of work, but it needs something but it's nothing big. Thank you guys.
20:10.260 - 20:17.580:  Olivia and Tina are volunteers who call themselves bike patrols. The group was set up less than a year
20:17.580 - 20:24.680:  ago by Ilka Polkinan, an ordinary citizen determined to find a solution to the problem of bike theft
20:24.680 - 20:31.900:  in Ulu. I want to help people get back bikes. Yeah, get back now over 1,000 bikes, but this is
20:32.800 - 20:39.880:  so good here. A man with a clear sense of purpose. Ilka is proudly tapping his chest while keeping an
20:39.880 - 20:47.680:  eye on his phone that never stops ringing or beeping. I have got maybe 50-60 machines today.
20:48.560 - 20:54.080:  What I have to check now in the evening and next night we are there two, three, four, five hour,
20:54.080 - 21:00.360:  I don't know. Ilka set up a website and the Facebook page last year. They are called stolen bikes
21:00.360 - 21:06.680:  in Ulu. People have been messaging him there if their bikes have disappeared or if they see an
21:06.680 - 21:14.940:  abandoned bike. As Ilka and the team take a break, grabbing coffees and cakes, I asked them why they
21:14.940 - 21:21.480:  give up their free time to chase stolen bikes. This is retired army officer Riemu one hand.
21:21.840 - 21:27.660:  I've always wanted to do something good for other people and now when I'm retired I have all the
21:27.660 - 21:33.480:  time in the world to do it. I don't need any salary or something. It's very nice to see someone
21:33.480 - 21:42.620:  smiling and saying that you are doing great work. That report was by Erika Benker in Finland.
21:44.620 - 21:50.140:  Still to come. Held in Black Rock desert, the annual festival is one of America's most well-known
21:50.140 - 21:55.880:  cultural events. Festival goers usually have to deal with high temperatures, dust and sand.
21:56.580 - 22:02.760:  But now more than 70,000 people have been stranded at the event in Nevada because of rainstorms.
22:08.780 - 22:12.780:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
22:12.920 - 22:18.840:  Our podcast Good Bad billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they made
22:18.840 - 22:23.080:  their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
22:23.240 - 22:26.600:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad gal as she claims,
22:26.900 - 22:31.600:  or what Jeff Bezos really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred
22:31.600 - 22:36.220:  billion dollars, listen to Good Bad billionaire with me Simon Jack. And me Zingsing,
22:36.360 - 22:38.420:  available now wherever you get your podcasts.
22:43.400 - 22:49.720:  The road to success seems quick. My first try to go to Edinburgh Games was in 1980.
22:49.720 - 22:52.820:  Everybody's been seeing me run for years growing up.
22:52.960 - 22:57.860:  Get to know the people behind the medals as Olympians and Paralympians share their stories.
22:58.140 - 23:01.740:  My story can help so many other victims and survivors.
23:02.880 - 23:06.600:  On the podium from the BBC World Service. The journey in the ups and downs.

23:13.560 - 23:14.760:  Now to Mongolia.
23:19.940 - 23:25.480:  That is the sound of a welcome ceremony for Pope Francis, who's on his first visit to Mongolia,
23:25.920 - 23:30.280:  which has one of the smallest Roman Catholic communities in the world, some 1500 people.
23:31.000 - 23:35.620:  In a speech in the capital Ulan Batar, Pope Francis spoke about the need to protect the
23:35.620 - 23:40.480:  environment. He also met the president of Mongolia. Our Asia Pacific editor Michael Bristo gave
23:40.480 - 23:45.100:  us more background on the visit, which is also being seen as an opportunity to send a message to
23:45.100 - 23:51.140:  Mongolia's giant neighbour, China. This is a tiny, tiny Catholic population and so
23:51.420 - 23:55.860:  one wonders why the Pope has gone there. Well, he often says, and that's been reiterated over
23:55.860 - 24:00.700:  the last couple of days, that he likes to go to the periphery of the Catholic world to show the
24:00.700 - 24:06.320:  universal nature of the church and certainly going to Mongolia would fulfill that.
24:06.960 - 24:12.140:  Also, he gets to talk about some universal themes that affect the whole world. So on Saturday
24:12.140 - 24:17.640:  he's spoken about issues such as environmental degradation, which is a problem in Mongolia.
24:17.640 - 24:22.080:  There's creeping desert, there's pollution in the winter from burning of coal. So it gives him
24:22.080 - 24:27.100:  a platform to talk about those issues as well. There's also the place where Mongolia is.
24:27.140 - 24:33.400:  It sits in East Asia right next to China, which has millions of Catholics and the Pope has spent
24:33.400 - 24:38.640:  a good amount of his time trying to improve relations with China five years ago. He signed
24:38.640 - 24:45.800:  an agreement with the Communist Party there to jointly administer the Catholic Church in China and
24:46.040 - 24:50.720:  he said, yes, countries have nothing to fear, secular institutions have nothing to fear
24:51.320 - 24:57.340:  from the Catholic Church because they're pushing no political agenda. I would see a direct reference
24:58.300 - 25:04.120:  to Beijing and to his attention to improve relations with the Chinese Communist Party.
25:07.120 - 25:12.040:  This is why governments and secular institutions have nothing to fear from the Church's work of
25:12.040 - 25:18.240:  evangelization because the Church has no political agenda to advance, but is sustained by the
25:18.240 - 25:24.440:  quiet power of God's grace and a message of mercy and truth, which is meant to promote the good
25:24.440 - 25:30.660:  of all. Interestingly, there doesn't appear to be an official delegation from mainland China.
25:30.660 - 25:35.000:  There is a delegation from Hong Kong, but not from mainland China. You would imagine that
25:35.720 - 25:39.940:  perhaps hundreds of thousands of Chinese Catholics would have wanted to go across the border there
25:40.380 - 25:45.620:  to see the Pope. They haven't gone. It's an indication of just how difficult the Pope's job is
25:45.620 - 25:52.240:  in trying to improve relations with China. Michael Bristo, the military junta in Gabon says it's
25:52.240 - 25:57.960:  reopening all borders with immediate effect. They were closed after Wednesday's coup. Tomas
25:57.960 - 26:03.460:  Naughty reports. It spokesman for Gabon's military announced the reopening of the borders on
26:03.460 - 26:09.240:  state television. The government of President Ali Bungo was out state shortly after he was declared
26:09.240 - 26:16.580:  winner in elections where he ran for a third time. Who led General Brice Olegier in Gamer has given
26:16.580 - 26:22.680:  reassurances that the suspension of state institutions will be temporary. But the opposition has warned that
26:22.820 - 26:28.520:  the junta is showing no signs of returning Gabon to civilian rule. General in Gamer had said
26:28.520 - 26:35.120:  he will not rise to hold elections to avoid what he described as repeating past mistakes.
26:35.860 - 26:42.400:  Tomas Naughty. India has launched its first mission to study the Sun just days after the country
26:42.400 - 26:48.520:  made history by landing a spacecraft near the Moon's south pole. Large crowds gathered to watch
26:48.520 - 26:54.160:  the rocket blast off from the southern state of Antropodesh, a reporter Azadem Ashiri monitored
26:54.160 - 27:06.300:  the launch. This was Aditya L1's lift off. The launch was from Shri Harikota on Saturday.
27:06.940 - 27:12.040:  After an hour and four minutes of flight time, the Indian Space Research Agency declared it
27:12.040 - 27:19.460:  mission successful. This is India's first space-based mission to study the Sun. The aim is to help
27:19.460 - 27:26.240:  scientists understand solar activity, its effect on earth and near space weather in real time.
27:26.960 - 27:32.160:  A few thousand people gathered in the viewing galleries set up by the Indian Space Research Agency.
27:32.160 - 27:38.040:  It was near the launch site to watch the blast off. Now let's break down what's installed for
27:38.040 - 27:43.560:  the spacecraft itself. It has to orbit the earth several times before being launched to its
27:43.560 - 27:50.940:  destination. That's L1. 1.5 million kilometers away from the earth and according to scientists,
27:50.940 - 27:58.520:  the journey will take four months. Once there, that's when the spacecraft can begin to orbit the Sun.
27:59.060 - 28:04.620:  Now of course this is a huge moment of pride for India and it's also only a week after India
28:04.620 - 28:10.500:  celebrated its first unmanned landing on the Moon. That became the world's first ever probe near
28:10.500 - 28:16.600:  the lunar South Pole and it made India only the fourth country to celebrate a soft landing on the
28:16.600 - 28:23.820:  Moon. Now of course these are big gains for India's space ambitions itself, but India's scientists
28:24.440 - 28:29.720:  also insist these will be big gains for the scientific community at large. As a day,
28:29.720 - 28:34.940:  Mushiri there. More than 70,000 people have been stranded at America's famous
28:34.940 - 28:41.480:  Burning Man festival in the desert state of Nevada because of rainstorms. They've been told no
28:41.480 - 28:47.020:  one can enter or leave the site which has turned into a bit of a mud bath from neighboring California.
28:47.020 - 28:52.920:  James Clayton has the latest. Held in Black Rock Desert, the annual festival is one of America's
28:52.920 - 28:58.240:  most well-known cultural events. Festival goers usually have to deal with high temperatures,
28:58.240 - 29:04.680:  dust and sand, but footage on social media shows them struggling to walk on muddy paths after
29:04.680 - 29:10.360:  the rain. Organizers have said no driving is permitted until the surface dries up with the
29:10.360 - 29:16.280:  exception of emergency services. One man at the festival told the BBC that most events had been
29:16.280 - 29:21.820:  called off as they largely take place in the playa, a dry lake bed where there is currently no
29:21.820 - 29:27.540:  way of getting in or out. The festival is in the middle of nowhere, deep in the Nevada desert.
29:27.960 - 29:33.520:  It's a hard place to get to. And with more rain and unusually cool temperatures expected on
29:33.520 - 29:39.780:  Sunday, many may be stuck in the mud for a good while yet. James Clayton in California.
29:40.920 - 29:42.180:  Now take a listen to this.
29:47.360 - 29:52.840:  That is Margaritaville, the mega hit of the American singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett,
29:53.380 - 29:59.200:  who just died at the age of 76. His brand of music was known as Tropical Rock and it made him
29:59.200 - 30:03.500:  millions of dollars. I heard more from our North America correspondent Peter Boes.
30:03.940 - 30:08.880:  Jimmy Buffett always had a dream of becoming a country singer. He was a busker. He worked for a
30:08.880 - 30:15.500:  while for the music magazine Billboard and he went on to develop the Tropical Rock genre in Florida
30:16.040 - 30:22.280:  with his breakthrough album, which was Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes. It included the
30:22.280 - 30:28.160:  song Margaritaville, which was a huge success. It enjoyed 22 weeks in the chart here. It was a
30:28.160 - 30:34.360:  song that captured the imagination of people through its somewhat melancholy lyrics. It's about
30:34.360 - 30:39.880:  a beach bum drinking on his front porch, lamenting a lost love nibbling at sponge cake,
30:39.880 - 30:44.880:  observing the tourists and generally feeling sorry for himself. It was a big hit, though.
30:45.240 - 30:49.760:  And it really catapulted Jimmy Buffett and his musical style to success.
30:50.080 - 30:54.960:  A lot of tributes around the world, big names like Elton John say that Buffett was a unique
30:54.960 - 31:01.120:  and treasured entertainer, many more tributes coming in as well. What about the appeal of Tropical
31:01.120 - 31:05.780:  Rock? Can you sum it up? It's fantasyland, it's escapism. You know when you're having a really
31:05.780 - 31:10.600:  bad day, you might close your eyes, imagine yourself sitting on a beach, sipping a Margarita.
31:11.160 - 31:16.220:  As Jimmy Buffett once said, it's part of the human condition that you've just got to have some fun.
31:16.260 - 31:21.860:  And he had a lot of fun, especially with his music, which was a mixture of country, pop,
31:21.860 - 31:26.300:  folk and rock, and included songs like this classic.
31:30.980 - 31:37.140:  I like mine with lettuce and tomato, pines 57 and french fry potatoes, big kosher pickle,
31:37.800 - 31:43.820:  and a cold draft beer. What is the not to like about those lyrics? And that's probably why he had
31:44.140 - 31:48.920:  legions of funds. By the way, they were known, his funds were known as parat heads because of the
31:48.920 - 31:54.400:  colorful headwear that they were done for his concerts. So great musician, great showman,
31:54.400 - 31:57.580:  it was also great businessman, wasn't he? Made a lot of money. Yeah, that's the fascinating
31:57.580 - 32:02.400:  thing about his story. He might have been singing about the simple life, but in reality,
32:02.400 - 32:08.560:  he was a workaholic, he capitalized on his fame and the way that his music connected with people
32:08.560 - 32:15.020:  to build his billion dollar empire, which was made up of restaurants, resorts, merchandise, selling,
32:15.520 - 32:21.780:  even retirement communities based on the margarita brand. He was clearly a marketing genius.
32:22.140 - 32:29.520:  Some people claim that there's a wall on the blame and I know.
32:30.400 - 32:33.400:  Pisa Bowes on the life of the American singer-songwriter,
32:33.760 - 32:35.960:  Ginny Buffett, who's died age 76.
