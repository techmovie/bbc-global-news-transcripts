*01:10.200- 01:16.340* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 27th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:16.980- 01:20.560* :  North Korea says it will deport the American soldier Travis King,
*01:20.620- 01:23.000* :  who ran across the border from the South in July.
*01:23.820- 01:27.700* :  The Exodus continues. It's reported almost half of the Armenian population
*01:27.820- 01:30.360* :  is now thought to have left Nagorno-Karabakh.
*01:31.000- 01:35.960* :  German police have raided homes and offices as they target an extreme neo-Nazi group.
*01:39.200- 01:43.700* :  Also in this podcast is this one way to try to treat Ukraine's war veterans.
*01:45.900- 01:50.740* :  For me, cannabis is helpful. Without it, I can't sleep. It helps me to relax.
*01:51.440- 01:53.620* :  I think it's important that everybody should have this.
*01:57.300- 02:01.740* :  Well, let's start on the Korean Peninsula, where an American soldier who crossed into North
*02:01.740- 02:06.900* :  Korea two months ago is now being expelled. The fate of Travis King has been unknown
*02:06.900- 02:09.720* :  since he ran across the border into North Korea in July.
*02:10.340- 02:12.520* :  He'd been serving with US forces in the South.
*02:13.160- 02:17.560* :  In the last couple of hours, Pyongyang has now announced it will deport private King.
*02:17.660- 02:22.700* :  So what happens next? Well, our correspondent, Jim McKenzie, is in the South Korean capital soul.
*02:23.200- 02:27.820* :  Well, we don't know, Robin, because actually there are two crucial things that are missing from
*02:27.820- 02:32.160* :  this statement that Pyongyang has released tonight. It's when they're going to deport him,
*02:32.160- 02:35.180* :  and it's how they're going to deport him. So what country they're going to deport him to?
*02:35.620- 02:40.200* :  All we know from tonight is that basically they have been investigating ever since
*02:40.200- 02:44.200* :  private Travis King crossed into the country two months ago. They've been absolutely
*02:44.200- 02:48.540* :  strong on his whereabouts, and tonight that they have been concluded that they have
*02:48.540- 02:53.280* :  finished his investigation and they are going to deport him because they say the soldier has
*02:53.280- 02:58.940* :  admitted to crossing into the country illegally. But much more than that, we don't know at this stage.
*02:59.440- 03:04.680* :  So I mean, a serving US soldier who is serving with those large number of US forces in South Korea,
*03:04.680- 03:09.780* :  crossing to the North is highly unusual. Can you just remind us a bit about the circumstances around
*03:09.780- 03:16.940* :  that moment? Yes, so private Travis King was serving here in South Korea. He was on tour
*03:16.940- 03:21.720* :  in South Korea because we've got an enormous amount of US soldiers that come through South Korea,
*03:21.940- 03:26.840* :  and he essentially was due to be sent back to the United States because he had got into trouble
*03:26.840- 03:30.940* :  here in South Korea, and it was thought that he was going to be disciplined by the US Army when he
*03:30.940- 03:35.880* :  got back possibly even discharged. So on the day he was due to be sent back, he got to the airport,
*03:35.880- 03:41.680* :  but he managed to leave the airport unshaperoned. He then booked himself onto a tour of the demilitarized
*03:41.680- 03:46.300* :  zone, which is the strip of land that divides North and South Korea, and while he was on this tour,
*03:46.300- 03:52.900* :  this tourist trip, he managed to run across the border. And just quickly, is there a sense of
*03:52.940- 03:57.860* :  tour that there are other things going behind closed doors that may have precipitated this announcement?
*04:00.220- 04:03.760* :  We don't know at this stage. I mean, look, there are various options about what North Korea could
*04:03.760- 04:07.780* :  choose to do with him. They could send him back across the demilitarized zone, so where he came from,
*04:08.140- 04:12.960* :  and give him to the UN forces that run that area. They could be arranging for the United States to
*04:12.960- 04:17.640* :  come and pick him up and take him home, although I think that is quite unlikely because the US and
*04:17.640- 04:21.180* :  North Korea don't have diplomatic relations, and they're not talking to each other at the moment,
*04:21.180- 04:25.360* :  and it doesn't seem that the North Koreans want to talk to the United States. Another option that
*04:25.360- 04:31.120* :  is being touted by analysts and experts is that North Korea might send him to a country that they're
*04:31.120- 04:36.480* :  currently friendly with. So China, perhaps, may be Russia, but of course, we will have to wait and
*04:36.480- 04:41.560* :  see. I think there are some, certainly, though, who think that this is a better outcome than they
*04:41.560- 04:45.360* :  were expecting, because of course, the North Koreans could have decided to hold private drivers'
*04:45.360- 04:49.300* :  king indefinitely. They could have put him on trial and sent him to a prison camp. They could
*04:49.300- 04:54.780* :  have used him as a pawn in negotiations with the US at a time they felt like, but we will have to
*04:54.780- 04:59.600* :  wait and see, of course, what happens. Jim McKenzie in Seoul. For days now, tens of thousands of
*04:59.600- 05:04.820* :  ethnic Armenians have been fleeing the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Today, it's being
*05:04.820- 05:11.160* :  reported that almost half the Armenian population that's around 50,000 people have left. That is,
*05:11.160- 05:17.480* :  despite, as Abijan insisting that the people in the enclave will be safe. Elchin Amibayov is a
*05:17.480- 05:24.600* :  special envoy to the president. There is no intention from our side to limit in whatever way,
*05:25.260- 05:30.820* :  the opportunities for the local population to enjoy their own language or culture or religion,
*05:31.700- 05:37.500* :  as it is the case with the rest of the Abijanian population. The only red line that we would never
*05:37.500- 05:43.520* :  allow to be trespassed is that they would put into question our sovereignty and territory integrity
*05:43.520- 05:47.680* :  and they would not put into question the unitary nature of our state.
*05:48.240- 05:54.300* :  Well, despite those reassurances, Armenia says ethnic tension persists. These people are among
*05:54.300- 06:02.880* :  those who are leaving the Nagorno-Karabakh and fear reprisals. We went to the airport. Everyone
*06:02.880- 06:08.400* :  was collected in one spot. Everyone was in a terrible state, stressed out, children crying,
*06:08.400- 06:14.340* :  old people crying, hungry, cold. No one is going back. That's all. We have turned the Karabakh
*06:14.340- 06:21.760* :  page over. It was tough there, but it was our land for generations, Armenian land. And now
*06:21.760- 06:28.360* :  today we are here. We are homeless. Well, just to remind you, as Abijan secured a quick victory
*06:28.360- 06:34.300* :  over separatists in last week's military offensive. It lasted just 24 hours. The confrontation was
*06:34.300- 06:40.020* :  the latest episode in decades of tension between Armenia and Abijan. So what are the authorities
*06:40.020- 06:46.440* :  saying now? Well, our correspondent Olga Ivshina is in Baku. My biggest question today was how long
*06:46.440- 06:51.600* :  is this checkpoint and this Vachin road? How long this is going to be open? Because there is
*06:52.040- 06:57.840* :  panic among people in Stepanakert, among those who are talking to that this road may close soon.
*06:58.180- 07:03.800* :  And the queue is so huge that you can already see it from the space. One challenge that's already
*07:03.800- 07:07.540* :  said that they're ready to keep checkpoints. As there are authorities who control the road,
*07:07.540- 07:13.100* :  told me that they're ready to keep checkpoints open as long as it's needed. They also promise to let
*07:13.100- 07:19.400* :  people back in if that's going to be needed later. It's, yeah, as you rightly said, it's a very
*07:19.400- 07:24.540* :  long and painful conglomerate. And it's important to remember that horrific scenes, which we are being
*07:24.540- 07:30.340* :  seen, which we are seeing now, 30 years ago, similar scenes were happening on the other side. When
*07:30.340- 07:36.860* :  around 1 million azeris had to leave Nagorno-Karabakh and urgently escape to the azeri territory.
*07:37.580- 07:42.680* :  So people are permitted to leave, but it's taking a long, long time. They're leaving in large
*07:42.680- 07:47.660* :  numbers as we're reporting. There are some reports that some people are being arrested as they
*07:47.660- 07:54.040* :  tried to leave. Do you have more on that? Yes, as Azeris said, they are guaranteed security
*07:54.040- 08:00.940* :  of civilians, but they reserve right to detain those who they can see as armed separatists,
*08:00.940- 08:07.200* :  of those accused of what they call war crimes and also who they call separatist leaders.
*08:07.660- 08:12.600* :  And among them was a minister, a minister of under-cognized Republic of Artsakh,
*08:12.600- 08:19.100* :  Ruben Vardanyan, who was detained earlier today. As Azeris said, it has a list of people.
*08:20.080- 08:26.460* :  They are interested in, and that's exactly what's happening. At the same time, it seems that the flow
*08:26.460- 08:34.080* :  of people is still moving slowly, so that's a good sign for the humanitarian situation on the ground.
*08:34.420- 08:38.540* :  And yeah, I think it's important to know that from the international point of view,
*08:38.880- 08:44.580* :  all of that is azeri territory, and that's the reason they are sort of facilitating that move.
*08:45.000- 08:48.520* :  And just quickly, the Americans in the Germans have called for independent observers to be
*08:48.520- 08:52.040* :  allowed into kind of oversee what's going on. Is there any chance that's going to happen?
*08:53.020- 08:57.620* :  Well, you know, that's what everyone is asking here, and we are asking access as well,
*08:57.620- 09:02.560* :  because Azeris are saying all these correct things, though, to say that they're giving promises,
*09:02.560- 09:06.680* :  but there is no access for independent media and independent observers.
*09:07.440- 09:12.140* :  Olga Ivshina reporting on the flow of people currently leaving Nagorno-Karabakh.
*09:13.120- 09:16.220* :  Let's go to Iraq now, where three days of national mourning has been declared,
*09:16.220- 09:19.880* :  after a fire at a wedding left more than 100 people dead,
*09:20.500- 09:23.580* :  including the bride and groom. Dozens more have been injured.
*09:23.940- 09:29.080* :  State media in Iraq say the authorities have issued 13 arrest warrants for staff and the
*09:29.080- 09:33.540* :  owners of the venue. Investigators think fireworks may have started the fire.
*09:33.960- 09:39.620* :  Ahmed Duba-Dani, a health official in Nineveh province, said the injured had been taken to hospitals in
*09:40.020- 09:50.220* :  Karakoschandinaya and Urbil. Most of them were completely burned, and others had up to 60% of
*09:50.220- 09:54.960* :  their bodies burned. This is terrible. Most of them were not in a good condition.
*09:58.620- 10:01.760* :  Well, I spoke to our correspondent, Lena Sinjab, who's in Beirut.
*10:02.240- 10:07.200* :  Unfortunately, the news are coming in bits and pieces about the situation overnight that was
*10:07.200- 10:13.200* :  supposed to be a lifetime celebration that ended into a nightmare. The Red Cross recently just
*10:13.200- 10:19.280* :  said that they've counted 450 casualties, but they couldn't confirm the number of that,
*10:19.280- 10:25.260* :  you know, officials earlier said that they confirmed that so far are 100 people so far.
*10:25.640- 10:29.200* :  And the initial reports that we've heard that, you know, unfortunately,
*10:29.260- 10:35.680* :  fireworks were used inside the wedding hall, and some flammable panels that were installed in
*10:35.680- 10:41.760* :  the pool helped the spread of the fire and also, you know, caused some damages to the ceiling.
*10:41.760- 10:46.980* :  People were rushing out, you know, rushing for their lives, but they were suffocated with
*10:46.980- 10:52.400* :  lack of oxygen, and many, unfortunately, were burned alive. I know it's early stages,
*10:52.480- 10:57.460* :  but is there a sense that this building was unsafe in terms of how it had been constructed,
*10:57.460- 11:02.080* :  in terms of, you know, viable safety exits for people to be able to leave, because that death
*11:02.080- 11:07.220* :  toll is such a high number. Indeed, and the problem is that it's still early to investigate
*11:07.220- 11:13.300* :  the situation. People are rushing to still help the survivors, but, you know, given the history
*11:13.300- 11:20.020* :  in Iraq and what's the situation, the corruption is widespread lack of accountability, lack of
*11:20.020- 11:25.600* :  efficiency. And in the past, you know, there were many reports of, you know, construction violating
*11:25.780- 11:32.500* :  the standards or even safety measures are not taking up to standards that caused the loss of life
*11:32.980- 11:39.300* :  in many past incidents. So, not surprising that something like this would happen in this issue,
*11:39.300- 11:45.740* :  but to start with is the big question mark to be raised, why would they use fireworks inside
*11:45.740- 11:52.720* :  the closed, you know, wedding hall, which, you know, everyone is confirming that was the spark of
*11:52.740- 11:57.920* :  of the reason why the blaze started. Well, I did want to ask you just quickly, Lena, for those
*11:57.920- 12:02.020* :  of us not familiar with these kind of celebrations in Iraq, I mean, would that be common at all?
*12:02.080- 12:06.880* :  I mean, inside the building to use those kind of fireworks? Logically speaking, you wouldn't
*12:06.880- 12:11.660* :  think that anyone would use that, but, you know, some of these celebrations, they do some sort
*12:11.660- 12:16.740* :  of the fireworks, they do some sort of like the birthday kind of what fireworks that are small,
*12:16.740- 12:21.540* :  but, you know, if there is no safety measures around, you know, anything could happen,
*12:21.540- 12:28.280* :  like what happened yesterday. Lena Sinjab reporting. In Germany, members of a neo-Nazi extremist group
*12:28.280- 12:33.000* :  regarded as one of the country's most dangerous, have been targeted in a series of police raids.
*12:33.000- 12:38.460* :  In the early hours of wednesday, officers enter dozens of homes and offices linked to the racist
*12:38.460- 12:44.560* :  and anti-Semitic group Art Gamineshaft, which means racial community. Our correspondent in the
*12:44.560- 12:49.880* :  capital Berlin is Damian McGinnis, and he told me more about why the group is seen as such a threat.
*12:50.620- 12:55.780* :  They were set up shortly after the end of the Second World War by a former SS officer.
*12:56.640- 13:03.700* :  They are effectively a sect with neo-pagan racist beliefs, anti-Semitic. It's a small grouping
*13:03.700- 13:09.680* :  with around 300 members, which sounds very insignificant, but they are spread all over the country,
*13:09.860- 13:13.740* :  and they have networks with lots of other far-right groups, and the aim really is to spread
*13:14.280- 13:19.480* :  far-right racist, anti-Semitic ideology to the next generation, because a lot of the members,
*13:19.480- 13:25.580* :  most of the members, are families and have a lot of children, and so the aim is to pass on this racist
*13:25.580- 13:31.080* :  ideology to young people, to children. It's a broad network that supports other extremist groups
*13:31.080- 13:37.220* :  as well, and which is very dangerous. So, for example, in 2019, a centre-right politician,
*13:37.320- 13:42.860* :  Walter Lubko, was murdered, assassinated just outside his home. That was carried out by a member
*13:42.860- 13:47.660* :  of this group. Also, in the early 2000s, there was a network called the NSU. They murdered
*13:47.660- 13:52.340* :  nine people with a migrant background, plus a police officer over the space of almost a decade.
*13:52.960- 13:59.740* :  One of the members of that group was given shelter by people belonging to this neo-Nazi network,
*13:59.740- 14:06.160* :  Art Gammain Shaft. So, it's a broad community, it's an extreme community, and the only question
*14:06.160- 14:10.020* :  really is why it's taken so long for the government to clamp down on them, because as I say,
*14:10.020- 14:13.860* :  they've been around since the 50s, so some people are saying, well, this is long overdue, really.
*14:14.040- 14:17.280* :  Well, I was going to ask you as well. Am I right that there have been some legal maneuverings
*14:17.300- 14:21.160* :  to ban this group? I mean, why haven't they been banned, or why hasn't membership of it been
*14:21.160- 14:27.020* :  banned up to this point? Yeah. So, the Interior Minister, Nancy Faezer, announced this morning that
*14:27.020- 14:32.120* :  the group had now been banned. It's taken months to prepare this. Almost a year really to prepare
*14:32.120- 14:36.240* :  legally for the ban, because it has to be legally sound. There's a very high hurdle, legally,
*14:36.920- 14:41.440* :  to ban independent organisations in Germany. But, a lot of people, as you say, are questioning,
*14:41.440- 14:45.700* :  why is it taken so long? Because it is clearly a very radical group, and there's evidence
*14:45.700- 14:50.260* :  that members of this group have either carried out crimes themselves or supported other people
*14:50.800- 14:56.840* :  carrying out neo-Nazi crimes. One theory is that Nancy Faezer herself is facing an election
*14:56.840- 15:01.660* :  in the region of Hessen. She wants to take over that region's premier. She's under fire. She's
*15:01.660- 15:07.100* :  not doing well in the polls. Some critics are saying that, well, this is part of her political
*15:07.100- 15:12.100* :  campaign, if you like, to show she's a tough interior minister. But there are high legal hurdles,
*15:12.240- 15:16.180* :  and it is part of a broader campaign of the government, really, to clamp down on far-right
*15:16.180- 15:22.540* :  extremism since being elected two years ago, this government, which has sent a left parties
*15:22.540- 15:28.100* :  within it, defines far-right extremism in Germany as the biggest terror threat facing the country.
*15:28.160- 15:33.720* :  So, it is something that's being taken very seriously. We are seeing a string of organisations
*15:33.880- 15:39.100* :  being banned, including one last week, Hammer Skims, which is an American neo-Nazi organisation.
*15:39.140- 15:44.340* :  Also, some people say over you because clearly far-right extremists, but it is happening,
*15:44.340- 15:48.560* :  so I think we are seeing action from the government to clamp down on what is quite a worrying
*15:48.560- 15:51.660* :  trend within Germany, within the more radical ends of the far-right.
*15:52.420- 15:57.720* :  Demi McGinnis speaking to me from Berlin. Now, here in the UK, after a week in which the
*15:57.720- 16:02.380* :  government made decisions to slow down the move to hit some of its targets on cutting carbon
*16:02.380- 16:07.880* :  emissions, energy companies have been given the go-ahead to extract oil and gas from a new field.
*16:07.880- 16:13.000* :  It's off the coast of Scotland. Rosebank, as it's known, is thought to have the largest
*16:13.000- 16:18.760* :  quantity of untapped fossil fuel in Britain, and the government argues it could increase this
*16:18.760- 16:21.020* :  country's fuel security. Simon Jack has more.
*16:21.620- 16:26.020* :  Rosebank will be one of the largest new oil and gas fields for decades and is thought to
*16:26.020- 16:30.900* :  contain 300 million barrels of oil. Permission to develop it will prove controversial,
*16:30.900- 16:35.940* :  as many will argue such a big new oil and gas project is inconsistent with the UK's
*16:35.940- 16:41.200* :  legally binding net zero 2050 targets. The government has already said it wants to max out
*16:41.200- 16:45.900* :  North Sea resources, as even the 2050 target allows for some oil and gas use,
*16:45.900- 16:50.740* :  and the Prime Minister has argued it makes no sense to import what we still need from abroad.
*16:50.740- 16:54.680* :  But others argue this oil will be sold internationally to the highest bidder,
*16:55.020- 16:59.400* :  and will make no difference to energy prices or security. Simon Jack reporting.
*17:03.180- 17:07.960* :  Coming up, what would you do if a bear, yes, a bear, crashed your quiet picnic?
*17:12.840- 17:16.020* :  Well, we'll explain how one Mexico family reacted.
*17:22.780- 17:26.060* :  The attacker had very good knowledge of banking systems.
*17:26.060- 17:29.800* :  $2.1 billion in stolen funds. Money laundering operations.
*17:30.020- 17:32.040* :  The cyber criminal group. These are slide guys.
*17:32.520- 17:38.060* :  Season 1 and 2 of the Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service are available in full right now.
*17:38.480- 17:42.820* :  Following the twists and turns in the incredible story of the Lazarus group hackers.
*17:43.460- 17:46.880* :  The Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service catch up with the whole series now,
*17:47.300- 17:48.880* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:54.900- 17:58.940* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Let's go to India now where demonstrators have
*17:58.940- 18:04.020* :  clashed with police for a second day in the capital of the Northeastern state of Manipur.
*18:04.480- 18:09.220* :  There are reports of dozens of people being injured, violence broke out in the city of Impal
*18:09.220- 18:14.520* :  on Tuesday. Protesters were angered when photographs emerged of the bodies of two students
*18:14.520- 18:19.600* :  from the May Thai community who went missing back in July. Here's the BBC Samira Hussein.
*18:20.120- 18:25.240* :  The teenagers had been missing for two months. When the BBC spoke with the families in August,
*18:25.240- 18:30.540* :  they remained hopeful, but the photographs which emerged on Tuesday confirmed they are dead.
*18:31.180- 18:37.260* :  Protesters have again taken to the streets demanding justice. In response to the latest flare-up,
*18:37.520- 18:44.060* :  India has imposed a controversial anti-insurgent law which gives the army absolute power in the state.
*18:44.320- 18:49.880* :  The situation in Manipur has been tense since ethnic violence broke out between the majority Hindu
*18:50.180- 18:56.160* :  and minority Christian kooky communities in May. Nearly 200 people have been killed so far.
*18:56.580- 19:01.520* :  Samira Hussein reporting. Ukraine has seen heavy losses in its fight against Russia,
*19:01.520- 19:05.460* :  and it is constantly trying to find ways to help treat its war veterans.
*19:05.460- 19:10.620* :  U.S. officials believe more than 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers who have been wounded
*19:11.120- 19:16.020* :  while tens of thousands have been traumatized. One option being proposed is medical cannabis,
*19:16.020- 19:20.660* :  but the idea and how to legalize it in Ukraine are prompting debates there,
*19:21.020- 19:22.740* :  as our correspondent Paul Adams reports.
*19:27.000- 19:33.320* :  In a key of apartment off duty soldiers meet, smoke cannabis, and forget for a moment the things
*19:33.320- 19:40.440* :  they've seen. They don't want to be identified. One is being treated for PTSD.
*19:42.860- 19:48.600* :  For me, for us, cannabis is helpful. Without it, I can't sleep. It helps me to relax.
*19:49.580- 19:51.800* :  I think it's important that everybody should have this.
*19:52.000- 19:57.460* :  Danilo Yevtohov suffered terrible burns to his face and hands during the Russian siege of
*19:57.460- 20:02.420* :  Cheneyiv in the early days of the war. Cannabis, he says, helped him deal with the pain.
*20:03.160- 20:10.020* :  I was sleeping better. I was less nervous. I started to have good appetite,
*20:10.540- 20:16.240* :  not like from classic painkillers. When I thought about my injuries, I felt like painful,
*20:16.540- 20:19.720* :  but my attention started to be more flexible.
*20:22.100- 20:27.660* :  At the Forest Glade Rehabilitation Center, just outside the capital, treatment takes many forms.
*20:27.660- 20:32.600* :  They try a bit of everything here, acupuncture, physical therapy, group discussions,
*20:32.600- 20:36.380* :  but the staff say they need more tools, including cannabis.
*20:36.720- 20:39.660* :  Ksenia Voiznitsina is Forest Glade's director.
*20:42.160- 20:48.160* :  Yes, yes, because, as I'm always saying, our soldiers on the front line need different powerful
*20:48.160- 20:54.780* :  weapons. We need an arsenal as well. The broader it is, the more effective our treatment can be.
*20:55.460- 21:01.940* :  We have to deal with symptoms like an anxiety, sleep disorders, and of course they take it
*21:02.140- 21:06.700* :  not to get high, but to get rid of the symptoms which bother them.
*21:07.080- 21:12.900* :  Around the world, research suggests cannabis may be useful in the treatment of PTSD and trauma,
*21:12.900- 21:19.240* :  but here in Ukraine, the law gets in the way. The production of marijuana, including for medical
*21:19.240- 21:27.280* :  research, is still banned. At a forensic lab in Kiev, Professor Victor Dosenko from the
*21:27.280- 21:34.880* :  National Academy of Science is frustrated. We have to do clinical research to get more convincing
*21:34.880- 21:41.180* :  evidence that it works, and use that research to help our military and civilians, because we really
*21:41.180- 21:49.220* :  are the global epicenter of PTSD. President Zelensky is urging change, pushing Parliament to
*21:49.220- 21:56.780* :  legalise medicinal cannabis, allow research and production. But ministers are divided over what's
*21:56.780- 22:00.400* :  needed. The legislation is blocked. What is not happening, you see?
*22:00.780- 22:06.080* :  Sergei Vlasenko, the opposition motherland party, says he has nothing against medical marijuana,
*22:06.180- 22:12.580* :  but he says the proposed new law does nothing to address Ukraine's urgent needs, and he's worried
*22:12.580- 22:17.400* :  that it invites corruption. The law is not about helping people today. The law is about
*22:17.400- 22:24.660* :  growing the marijuana in Ukraine and making that big business and making that private business.
*22:25.300- 22:32.220* :  Today, in the period of war, such risky for the society businesses should be controlled
*22:32.220- 22:38.640* :  directly by the government. Most Ukrainians agree that medical cannabis ought to be available.
*22:38.660- 22:44.080* :  Some of those we spoke to said privately they believed politically connected criminal interests
*22:44.100- 22:50.340* :  were preventing change, protecting the country's lucrative black market. Until the politicians
*22:50.400- 22:55.200* :  can agree on how to move forward, soldiers will have to carry on medicating themselves.
*22:58.720- 23:04.180* :  Paul Adams reporting from Ukraine. A major international study of women and cancer has concluded
*23:04.180- 23:09.780* :  that a more female centric approach to treatment could save tens of thousands of lives every year.
*23:10.260- 23:15.260* :  A report published in the medical journal The Lancet examined women in 185 countries.
*23:15.720- 23:20.180* :  It calls for what is known as an intersectional feminist approach to cancer treatment.
*23:20.840- 23:25.600* :  Dr. Ophira Ginsburg from the National Cancer Institute in the United States was one of the people
*23:25.600- 23:30.800* :  behind the recommendations. An intersectional feminist approach to cancer means that we're
*23:30.800- 23:37.400* :  looking really at the power dynamics that influence a woman's opportunities to prevent getting
*23:37.400- 23:43.440* :  cancer to understand her risks to make decisions about her own health care as it relates to cancer
*23:43.440- 23:48.500* :  prevention screening and treatment and also as it relates to women as providers of care.
*23:48.860- 23:54.140* :  So the 800,000 number comes from a study that we also published in The Lancet Global Health
*23:54.140- 24:00.260* :  today in conjunction with the Lancet report and that refers to the number of women's lives
*24:01.540- 24:07.160* :  that could be saved from a premature death under the age of 70 if every woman everywhere
*24:07.800- 24:14.360* :  had access to the optimal care. And so we did that by looking at the best performing countries
*24:14.360- 24:22.340* :  in terms of survival. We looked at how the best performers were doing. And so this was an opportunity
*24:22.340- 24:28.640* :  to take a deeper dive also into the numbers of cancers that could be prevented in the first place
*24:28.660- 24:36.280* :  and women's lives that could be saved. 1.3 million saved a premature death if all women also
*24:36.280- 24:41.940* :  had access to prevention and early detection. Stigma is also a major issue and we covered this
*24:42.360- 24:46.820* :  in the Commission report in some cultures more than others but this is in every country.
*24:47.460- 24:53.820* :  Ophira Ginsburg from the National Cancer Institute in the US. Now to an exhibition here in London,
*24:54.140- 25:00.160* :  email is dead is the provocative title. In fact the word dead has a delete line through it
*25:00.540- 25:05.400* :  reflecting the stubborn survival of email because despite all the other forms of communication now
*25:05.400- 25:11.740* :  available to us email is still used by more than 4 billion people 50 years after its invention.
*25:12.260- 25:17.360* :  The exhibition at the Design Museum includes sound exhibits which aim to show an email's journey
*25:17.860- 25:29.980* :  making its way from one centre to another. Josephine Chanter, director of audiences at the
*25:29.980- 25:33.820* :  Design Museum, told my colleague Martha Carney about the concept of the exhibition.
*25:34.480- 25:40.680* :  So we wanted to look at email as it's one of the tools and technologies that's all around us but
*25:40.680- 25:45.720* :  we don't take the time to really stop and see how it's impacted our lives really over the last
*25:45.720- 25:51.460* :  50 years. At the museum we look at a lot of tools and technologies. We've recently done a
*25:51.820- 25:58.660* :  experiment with AI and a robot who identifies as an artist and so when MailChimp approached us to
*25:58.660- 26:03.920* :  look at email we realised this was something intangible that we could do something really interesting
*26:03.960- 26:10.600* :  with. And why do you think it has survived despite what's at tweets every so many other forms of
*26:10.600- 26:15.220* :  communication? Well in many ways it's replaced the letter. It's become the formal communication
*26:15.220- 26:24.340* :  channel that we all use. It's also so instant, it's so global, it can reach people in huge volume.
*26:24.340- 26:31.080* :  Sometimes you know too much volume. That it can go wrong. I've already emailed. I've got absolutely
*26:31.080- 26:35.920* :  you know email I'm again and when you accidentally reply to 40,000 people and we touch upon some of
*26:35.920- 26:41.480* :  those incidents in the exhibition and how we might be able to improve and develop email to make
*26:41.480- 26:45.860* :  it more effective too. There was a romance about the letter. I know it makes me sound so refreshing
*26:45.860- 26:50.280* :  but I can remember travelling and going to post-restaurant places and finding those little
*26:50.680- 26:57.480* :  blue forms that you just don't get with an email. I think so that particularly letters the way
*26:57.480- 27:02.220* :  they are physical and I know lots of people have said to me that they print out emails to get
*27:02.220- 27:07.380* :  that physicality. But we have a part in the exhibition where we've looked at significant emails
*27:07.380- 27:14.740* :  that people have received. You know a diagnosis or an invitation or a job offer and those seismic
*27:14.740- 27:20.440* :  events happen through email and that's a really interesting space that we wanted to explore.
*27:20.960- 27:25.500* :  My colleague Martha Carney who clearly really still misses the letter talking to Josephine Chanta
*27:25.500- 27:32.080* :  from the design museum here in London. Now to a picnic in Mexico and a stray bear. It was a
*27:32.080- 27:37.100* :  friendly bear though and happily not a very big one. No one got hurt in the peaceful but
*27:37.100- 27:40.760* :  anxious encounter and it was all caught on camera. Here's Harry Blight.
*27:41.140- 27:47.600* :  Chappinque ecological park in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. A mother, her son and a friend
*27:47.640- 27:51.320* :  are sat having lunch when a black bear leaps onto the table.
*27:54.940- 27:59.400* :  It's the boys 15th birthday and for lunch there's a celebratory spread of traditional
*27:59.400- 28:04.560* :  Mexican enchiladas and tacos all of which are sampled by the intruding bear.
*28:09.720- 28:15.040* :  The mother is seen covering her child's face presumably so as not to scare him with the bear
*28:15.040- 28:21.820* :  just centimeters away. After eating it moves across the picnic table, jumps down and runs off.
*28:22.860- 28:27.980* :  The video taken by the mother's friend was uploaded to TikTok where already it has over 10
*28:27.980- 28:33.960* :  million views. The Chappinque park is located in the natural habitat of the North American Black
*28:33.960- 28:39.400* :  Bear. It's a species that's listed as endangered by the Mexican authorities because of destruction
*28:39.400- 28:45.060* :  to its habitat and illegal hunting. The park website says encounters with black bears have
*28:45.060- 28:50.820* :  increased in the area and has provided a list of recommendations of what to do if you encounter a bear.
*28:51.340- 28:55.100* :  One of them is that visitors should never try to photograph a bear up close.
*28:58.260- 29:02.400* :  Well that report from Harry Blight and if you want to see the video add your name to the list of
*29:02.400- 29:09.720* :  10 million who already have you can go to our website bbc.com slash news. Let's end this global
*29:09.720- 29:13.300* :  news podcast on something the US and Russia are still doing together happily.
*29:14.160- 29:21.200* :  Harry Blight on maximum four maximum G-load.
*29:25.520- 29:29.520* :  Well that is the sound of mission control monitoring the journey back to Earth from the
*29:29.520- 29:35.340* :  International Space Station. The American astronaut Frank Rubio and Russian cosmonauts Sergei
*29:35.340- 29:42.040* :  Prokobiev and Demetri Patelin traveled home together aboard the Soyuz MS-23. Here is the moment
*29:42.040- 29:50.880* :  they landed side by side in Kazakhstan. Touchdown. Touchdown confirmed at 6.17 am central time.
*29:51.140- 30:00.260* :  Rubio's record ride comes to an end as he Prokobiev and Patelin return to Earth after a 371 day
*30:00.260- 30:04.740* :  157 million mile journey at the International Space Station.
*30:08.060- 30:13.280* :  The third longest flight ever in human spaceflight history is over with a pinpoint landing on the
*30:13.280- 30:19.460* :  step of Kazakhstan. Well that pinpoint landing was a while coming though because get this the trio
*30:19.460- 30:24.800* :  are six months late returning to Earth because of a malfunction on their original spacecraft.
*30:24.800- 30:31.680* :  That gave the two Russians and Rubio an unexpectedly extended mission of 371 days in orbit.
*30:31.680- 30:36.380* :  It's the longest space mission for an American but not for the Russians because that world
*30:36.380- 30:43.340* :  record is held by Russia's Valerie Polyakov who spent 437 consecutive days in space.
*30:46.860- 30:51.120* :  Okay that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*30:51.120- 30:56.380* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can send us an email
*30:56.380- 31:03.240* :  the address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on X formerly known as Twitter
*31:03.240- 31:08.720* :  at Global NewsPod. Now this edition was mixed by Lewis Orp and the producer was Tracy Gordon.
*31:08.720- 31:13.040* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Robin Brant. Until next time, thanks for listening. Goodbye.
