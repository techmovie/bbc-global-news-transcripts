*01:34.860- 01:37.660* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:41.040- 01:44.640* :  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 19th of September,
*01:44.640- 01:45.920* :  these are our main stories.
*01:46.480- 01:50.980* :  Canada says it's told India of its concerns that Indian intelligence services
*01:50.980- 01:54.460* :  might be connected to the killing of an exiled Sikh leader.
*01:55.040- 01:58.600* :  Five American prisoners who were detained for years in Iranian jails
*01:58.600- 02:03.040* :  are on their way home as part of a complex exchange deal mediated by Qatar.
*02:03.640- 02:06.380* :  And world leaders meeting at the United Nations in New York
*02:06.380- 02:09.380* :  have warned that global attempts to end extreme poverty
*02:09.800- 02:11.800* :  and tackle climate change are in reverse.
*02:15.040- 02:18.240* :  Also in this podcast, at $80 million a pop,
*02:18.240- 02:21.300* :  the F-35 Lightning 2's joint strike fighter
*02:21.620- 02:24.140* :  is not the kind of thing you want to lose if you can help it.
*02:24.540- 02:26.860* :  But that is exactly what has happened.
*02:27.380- 02:29.720* :  And now the US military is appealing to the public
*02:29.720- 02:34.560* :  to help it find its stealth fighter jet following a mishap over South Carolina.
*02:39.260- 02:43.040* :  We start in Canada, where the country's prime minister Justin Trudeau
*02:43.040- 02:46.340* :  says the Indian government could be behind the fatal shooting
*02:46.340- 02:49.240* :  of a Canadian citizen in June in Canada.
*02:49.620- 02:53.780* :  The Sikh leader Hadib Singh Nijar was shot dead outside a Sikh temple
*02:53.780- 02:56.120* :  on the 18th of June in British Columbia.
*02:56.660- 02:59.260* :  Mr. Trudeau made the announcement in a statement to Parliament.
*02:59.760- 03:02.860* :  Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing
*03:02.860- 03:05.620* :  credible allegations of a potential link
*03:05.620- 03:08.200* :  between agents of the government of India
*03:08.520- 03:12.280* :  and the killing of a Canadian citizen, Hadib Singh Nijar.
*03:12.500- 03:16.260* :  Our top priorities have been one that our law enforcement
*03:16.260- 03:20.800* :  and security agencies ensure the continued safety of all Canadians
*03:20.800- 03:25.680* :  and two that all steps be taken to hold perpetrators
*03:25.680- 03:27.080* :  of this murder to account.
*03:27.580- 03:30.820* :  Mr. Nijar was a prominent Sikh leader in British Columbia,
*03:30.820- 03:33.820* :  often voicing his support for separatists.
*03:33.820- 03:38.000* :  India in the past had raised concerns about campaigners like him.
*03:38.620- 03:40.940* :  While I heard more from the BBC's Nadine Yusuf,
*03:40.980- 03:42.720* :  who was in the Canadian city of Toronto.
*03:43.100- 03:45.700* :  Hadib Singh Nijar, he is a prominent Sikh activist
*03:45.700- 03:47.100* :  and leader here in Canada.
*03:47.360- 03:50.180* :  And he was murdered in mid-June at a parking lot
*03:50.180- 03:51.980* :  outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia,
*03:51.980- 03:53.580* :  specifically the city of Suri.
*03:53.580- 03:57.200* :  Police at the time said that he was shot dead by two masked men.
*03:57.300- 04:01.560* :  India has previously sort of identified Mr. Nijar as a terrorist
*04:01.560- 04:05.440* :  and he said that he has led a militant separatist group.
*04:05.620- 04:06.580* :  And at the time of his death,
*04:06.620- 04:09.220* :  he was actually in the process of planning a local referendum
*04:09.220- 04:14.480* :  here in Canada on the creation of an independent Sikh state in India.
*04:14.780- 04:16.700* :  And so since his death, you know,
*04:16.700- 04:19.640* :  because of the accusation that the Indian government has leveled against him,
*04:19.780- 04:21.920* :  his supporters here in Canada have been quite vocal
*04:21.920- 04:25.120* :  and they've accused India of being behind his murder.
*04:25.280- 04:28.220* :  And at the time, police said it was a targeted incident,
*04:28.220- 04:31.500* :  but they didn't specify who could be behind his killing.
*04:31.640- 04:33.620* :  And from the very beginning, when this happened,
*04:33.620- 04:38.520* :  were there suspicions or were there local or national politicians
*04:39.220- 04:41.080* :  pointing the thing at the Indian state?
*04:41.280- 04:46.180* :  Politicians for the most part had been accusing India directly prior to today.
*04:46.800- 04:50.780* :  We had one leader of the new Democratic Party here in Canada.
*04:51.340- 04:55.160* :  He sort of mentioned that Canada should look at the murder of Mr. Nijar,
*04:55.160- 04:57.740* :  that it's serious, that it's clearly a targeted incident,
*04:57.760- 04:59.500* :  and that it needs to investigate it.
*04:59.900- 05:04.500* :  But nobody had sort of leveled such a clear accusation against India up until today.
*05:05.040- 05:07.340* :  Now, his supporters have accused India
*05:07.920- 05:09.060* :  of being behind the murder.
*05:09.280- 05:10.980* :  And you know, Mr. Nijar, prior to his death,
*05:10.980- 05:13.200* :  has said that he felt that he was being targeted
*05:13.200- 05:14.800* :  and that he was receiving threats.
*05:14.980- 05:16.520* :  So it was certainly part of the conversation,
*05:16.520- 05:18.140* :  just not on a political level.
*05:18.320- 05:22.420* :  What about the specifics of what Justin Trudeau has said in Parliament today?
*05:22.800- 05:24.560* :  I mean, has he just leveled the accusation?
*05:24.560- 05:26.760* :  Has he pointed the finger? Are there more details?
*05:27.160- 05:29.580* :  So he basically said that Canadian intelligence
*05:29.580- 05:33.340* :  has found a credible link between India and the murder,
*05:33.580- 05:35.080* :  which happened on Canadian soil.
*05:35.480- 05:39.900* :  What he specifically said is that they found that agents of the Indian government
*05:39.900- 05:41.480* :  may have carried out the killing.
*05:41.480- 05:43.600* :  So that is specifically what he said.
*05:43.600- 05:45.840* :  He wasn't very clear on details.
*05:45.840- 05:48.800* :  They've been a bit vague on it saying that the murder investigation
*05:49.420- 05:53.300* :  is currently undergoing and they don't want to jeopardize it by saying too much.
*05:53.300- 05:55.820* :  But essentially, he did point a clear link between
*05:55.820- 05:59.720* :  what Canadian intelligence in saying India and the murder of Mr. Nijar.
*05:59.880- 06:01.560* :  So the murder investigation is ongoing.
*06:01.580- 06:04.460* :  And at the same time, the Prime Minister has stood up and pointed the finger
*06:04.460- 06:06.160* :  of the Indian government. That's what's happened.
*06:06.360- 06:08.800* :  Yes. He seems to think that he has enough evidence
*06:08.900- 06:11.200* :  that links India to the murder.
*06:11.340- 06:13.440* :  But we have not seen any of that evidence.
*06:13.440- 06:14.800* :  It has not been made public.
*06:15.460- 06:18.180* :  But I should say that this kind of comes after a testing meeting
*06:18.180- 06:21.460* :  between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Justin Trudeau
*06:21.460- 06:25.120* :  at last week's G20 summit in which Prime Minister Modi accused Canada
*06:25.120- 06:27.060* :  of not doing enough to address what he called
*06:27.620- 06:30.900* :  anti-India activities of extreme and elements on Canadian soil.
*06:31.040- 06:33.060* :  And so the relationship between the two has been
*06:33.060- 06:36.220* :  tested for some time and sort of culminated in today's announcement.
*06:36.420- 06:40.240* :  Nadine Yusef in Toronto and I should add, as we record this podcast,
*06:40.240- 06:43.280* :  that there's been no comment from India on Monday's allegations.
*06:44.000- 06:47.000* :  Though in the past, its government has denied any involvement.
*06:48.060- 06:52.080* :  Now, five Americans with dual Iranian nationality have been freed
*06:52.080- 06:54.340* :  after spending years in prison in Iran.
*06:55.160- 06:59.500* :  Tehran will gain access to six billion dollars worth of oil revenue
*06:59.500- 07:03.240* :  as part of a rare and complex deal that's been broken by Qatar.
*07:03.260- 07:06.660* :  Five Iranians have also been released from U.S. jails.
*07:07.040- 07:10.640* :  On Monday afternoon, the Americans were flown to the Qatari capital Doha
*07:10.640- 07:13.540* :  where they embraced U.S. officials and each other.
*07:13.700- 07:16.720* :  President Biden announced fresh sanctions on Iran,
*07:17.320- 07:20.060* :  saying it would continue to pay for its provocative actions.
*07:20.760- 07:23.160* :  Our chief international correspondent, Lise Tusset, was there
*07:23.160- 07:25.340* :  as the prisoners plain landed in Doha.
*07:28.820- 07:33.320* :  The Qatar Airways plain finally landed as the sun was setting here in Doha.
*07:33.340- 07:39.160* :  This was the moment which confirmed that five American citizens were finally free.
*07:39.760- 07:43.520* :  One of them, 51-year-old Siamak Namazee, said in a statement,
*07:43.520- 07:45.320* :  their nightmare was over.
*07:45.800- 07:53.080* :  He said he had dreamed of this day, every one of the 2,898 days he was held in Iran.
*07:53.800- 07:57.120* :  Most of them in the notorious Evan prison in Tehran.
*07:57.680- 08:02.340* :  On the tarmac, the former prisoners embraced the waiting American and Qatari
*08:02.340- 08:05.000* :  officials, then walked arm in arm.
*08:05.740- 08:08.980* :  Inside the terminal, they took a call from the U.S. Secretary of State,
*08:08.980- 08:09.900* :  Anthony Blinken.
*08:09.900- 08:13.260* :  He issued a statement in Washington shortly after.
*08:13.780- 08:17.360* :  Today, their freedom, the freedom of these Americans,
*08:18.280- 08:21.080* :  for so long unjustly imprisoned and detained in Iran,
*08:21.960- 08:23.280* :  means some pretty basic things.
*08:24.040- 08:29.720* :  Husbands and wives, fathers and children, grandparents can hug each other again.
*08:30.500- 08:32.300* :  The moment the plane touched down in Doha,
*08:32.300- 08:37.920* :  U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against senior Iranian officials
*08:38.500- 08:41.740* :  for their role in what he called wrongful detentions.
*08:42.460- 08:46.340* :  U.S. officials insist that the Iranian money released in this deal
*08:46.340- 08:51.820* :  will only be accessed by third parties for the purchase of non-sanctioned goods,
*08:52.200- 08:53.640* :  such as food and medicine.
*08:54.360- 08:58.720* :  The former prisoners, now on their way home, thank the U.S. President
*08:58.720- 09:01.720* :  for putting their lives above politics.
*09:01.720- 09:04.400* :  Least you said, watching the plane land in Doha.
*09:05.000- 09:08.460* :  Well, there has been plenty of criticism of the deal in the United States,
*09:08.460- 09:12.440* :  with some people suggesting it would only encourage more hostage-taking.
*09:13.080- 09:15.800* :  Perhaps to forstall such criticism, the U.S.
*09:15.800- 09:18.240* :  imposed further sanctions, as we just mentioned,
*09:18.240- 09:22.120* :  on Iran's intelligence ministry and on the former Iranian President,
*09:22.120- 09:23.420* :  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
*09:24.020- 09:27.620* :  I spoke to our North America correspondent, Nudda Tulfik, who's in New York,
*09:28.140- 09:30.960* :  and asked her about the criticism of the U.S. Iran deal.
*09:31.580- 09:35.720* :  Several Republicans, both senators and representatives in Congress,
*09:35.720- 09:38.540* :  have come out to say that while the U.S.
*09:38.540- 09:43.240* :  should be on relenting in its efforts to bring home detained Americans,
*09:43.240- 09:49.860* :  that this now will just embolden America's enemies to turn to hostage-taking,
*09:49.860- 09:53.940* :  that it will put more American safety and security at risk.
*09:54.340- 09:58.900* :  And even Senator Ted Cruz of Texas went as far as to alleged that
*09:59.300- 10:03.600* :  the Biden administration had struck a secret nuclear deal with the Iranian regime
*10:03.600- 10:06.300* :  that was being kept from Congress and the American people.
*10:06.300- 10:08.300* :  So we've heard that criticism.
*10:08.400- 10:10.580* :  They're also pointing to the dollar amount here,
*10:10.580- 10:13.220* :  the six billion that has been unfrozen.
*10:13.220- 10:17.080* :  But the White House has really hit back at these comments.
*10:17.100- 10:22.060* :  They've said that the utmost priority for President Biden is to bring Americans home
*10:22.060- 10:23.400* :  that that's above politics.
*10:23.400- 10:27.420* :  And they say that these six billion in funds that are in South Korea
*10:27.940- 10:32.280* :  were payments that South Korea actually made to Iran for purchase of oil years ago,
*10:32.620- 10:34.300* :  including during the last administration.
*10:34.420- 10:38.140* :  And they say that it will only go to humanitarian transactions,
*10:38.260- 10:40.840* :  food, medicine, agricultural products,
*10:40.840- 10:44.240* :  and that if they find that Iran is trying to divert those funds,
*10:44.240- 10:46.620* :  that they will take action to lock it up.
*10:47.000- 10:50.520* :  And what we've really seen is statements from all of the families
*10:50.520- 10:55.600* :  saying they are grateful to President Biden for making the difficult but necessary decision
*10:55.600- 10:58.440* :  to prioritize American citizens over politics.
*10:58.440- 11:00.760* :  Each of the families put out that statement.
*11:00.760- 11:04.480* :  So clearly this is a very political, controversial decision.
*11:05.000- 11:07.060* :  But from those five Americans families,
*11:07.060- 11:10.640* :  they have made a point to be public in thanking President Biden.
*11:10.980- 11:14.500* :  I mean, is there a hope and ambition where you are in Washington?
*11:14.500- 11:17.560* :  And maybe perhaps at the United Nations that this will lower tensions
*11:17.560- 11:19.140* :  between Iran and the U.S.?
*11:19.140- 11:22.380* :  It's a good sign in terms of their very fragile relationship.
*11:22.520- 11:25.420* :  Yeah, I mean, look, I'm here at the start of the UN General Assembly.
*11:25.420- 11:28.980* :  We heard from the Secretary General spokesperson saying that,
*11:28.980- 11:30.780* :  look, whenever there's cooperation like this,
*11:30.780- 11:34.240* :  they're hopeful that it could help when there is a bit of unity,
*11:34.240- 11:37.000* :  even if it is on just one very isolated incidence.
*11:37.580- 11:38.880* :  But other diplomats we spoke to,
*11:38.880- 11:41.300* :  including Secretary Blinken made it very clear
*11:41.300- 11:44.960* :  that they don't see this as a major change in Iran-US relations.
*11:44.960- 11:48.880* :  And this is very much different from, say, the nuclear deal on negotiations.
*11:49.480- 11:50.920* :  Not a topic in New York.
*11:50.920- 11:53.820* :  So how is Monday's news being viewed in Iran?
*11:53.820- 11:55.640* :  Well, my colleague, Rebecca Kespy,
*11:55.640- 12:00.040* :  spoke to Adnan Tabatabyeh and Iranian analyst currently in Tehran.
*12:00.400- 12:05.320* :  Obviously, it is reported as a big triumph for the Islamic Republic
*12:05.320- 12:10.060* :  and that, in fact, the American side now have to give in.
*12:10.540- 12:14.800* :  But at the same time, there is also the attempt, at least by the foreign ministry,
*12:14.800- 12:19.760* :  to try and link it to the potential revitalization of the talks
*12:19.760- 12:21.660* :  regarding the nuclear agreement.
*12:21.660- 12:24.520* :  So it, in fact, goes both ways.
*12:25.220- 12:28.060* :  Interesting. And so what are your thoughts?
*12:28.140- 12:29.600* :  Do you think that is possible?
*12:29.600- 12:32.120* :  Because this, I mean, it seems like a dramatic movement
*12:32.220- 12:34.880* :  to have these five detainees released.
*12:34.880- 12:38.360* :  Could part of the understanding from Tehran
*12:38.360- 12:42.720* :  been to try to encourage a better relationship with the United States?
*12:43.220- 12:49.440* :  At least it can open the path towards some more meaningful talks.
*12:50.080- 12:52.960* :  We have to take into consideration that any resumption
*12:52.960- 12:56.480* :  of the nuclear talks are anything close to the revitalization.
*12:56.720- 13:00.340* :  Often nuclear agreement had to be sold to the domestic
*13:00.340- 13:02.420* :  seeing both in Tehran and in Washington.
*13:02.940- 13:04.520* :  And in order to be able to do that,
*13:04.520- 13:08.480* :  some sort of breakthrough in other fields and other domains
*13:08.800- 13:10.460* :  had to be championed.
*13:10.460- 13:13.860* :  And I think that this prisoner swap allows both sides
*13:13.860- 13:16.380* :  to tell their domestic audience we achieved something.
*13:16.860- 13:19.800* :  And now we have some sort of justification
*13:19.800- 13:22.900* :  to maybe pursue with talks on other issues as well.
*13:23.380- 13:25.640* :  Adnan Tabatabye in Tehran.
*13:26.660- 13:28.500* :  World leaders meeting at the United Nations
*13:28.500- 13:31.160* :  have warned that attempts to end extreme poverty
*13:31.160- 13:33.840* :  and tackle climate change are going in reverse.
*13:34.600- 13:38.380* :  The UN Secretary General Antonia Guterres called for a new plan
*13:38.380- 13:40.920* :  to rescue the goals for sustainable development.
*13:41.580- 13:43.000* :  James Lendel is in New York.
*13:43.440- 13:47.000* :  The so-called sustainable development goals known as SDGs
*13:47.000- 13:49.260* :  were supposed to be met by 2030.
*13:49.980- 13:54.240* :  Mr Guterres wants UN leaders to promise a £400 billion cash stimulus
*13:54.240- 13:58.680* :  to kickstart the SDGs, new forms of debt relief for poorer countries
*13:59.060- 14:02.060* :  and more focus from international banks on development needs.
*14:02.720- 14:05.600* :  In a statement, the world leaders promised action on these issues.
*14:06.200- 14:09.680* :  But diplomats and charities fear the global cost of living crisis
*14:10.300- 14:13.460* :  and geopolitical divisions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine
*14:14.020- 14:16.020* :  may make it harder for countries to focus
*14:16.020- 14:17.760* :  on the sustainable development goals.
*14:18.460- 14:20.940* :  Let alone agree how to get them back on track.
*14:21.720- 14:23.180* :  We're going to go to Ukraine now,
*14:23.180- 14:27.120* :  where the government continues to fight Russian forces on multiple fronts.
*14:27.900- 14:30.000* :  But the Zelensky government is also engaged
*14:30.000- 14:32.900* :  in its own internal battles against corruption.
*14:33.580- 14:35.920* :  The country's new defence minister, Rustin Umarov,
*14:35.920- 14:38.000* :  has removed six of his deputies.
*14:38.520- 14:40.460* :  Just weeks after he was brought in,
*14:40.720- 14:43.040* :  partly in the wake of allegations surrounding corruption
*14:43.040- 14:44.360* :  in defence procurement.
*14:44.960- 14:47.240* :  The reshuffle comes as Ukraine's military
*14:47.240- 14:50.620* :  is reporting its forces are recapturing more territory
*14:50.620- 14:51.740* :  in the east of the country.
*14:52.420- 14:54.900* :  I spoke to our key correspondent, James Waterhouse,
*14:54.900- 14:57.360* :  for the latest, and I started by asking him
*14:57.760- 15:00.680* :  what's behind this apparent reboot at the defence ministry?
*15:01.060- 15:04.580* :  Now on a surface level, a minister replacing his whole team
*15:04.580- 15:08.680* :  is unsurprising, and he will want to have his best people
*15:08.680- 15:11.040* :  in his eyes closest to him.
*15:11.520- 15:15.240* :  So those who've been removed include the rather prominent
*15:15.540- 15:17.620* :  military spokesperson, Anna Mila,
*15:18.100- 15:21.100* :  who many will have seen behind podiums giving updates
*15:21.120- 15:25.760* :  on situations across the front line in military uniform.
*15:25.760- 15:28.940* :  She was recently criticised for giving reports
*15:28.940- 15:32.140* :  that were ultimately not the case in terms of liberation.
*15:32.240- 15:35.700* :  Now it's a difficult job you could argue in briefing journalists
*15:35.700- 15:37.680* :  on a fast-moving situation.
*15:37.760- 15:39.880* :  But I think if you look at Anna Mila,
*15:39.900- 15:43.640* :  if you look at Mr Umarov's predecessor, Alexei Resnikov,
*15:44.000- 15:46.620* :  they have struggled to keep claims of corruption
*15:47.140- 15:48.020* :  out of the ministry.
*15:48.280- 15:49.420* :  Can I ask you about her, though?
*15:49.420- 15:50.780* :  I mean, it seems to me from what you said
*15:50.780- 15:53.540* :  that maybe this was someone who was spinning too much, frankly,
*15:54.060- 15:56.500* :  and when expectation management about the spring offensive
*15:56.500- 15:58.680* :  is so important, particularly maybe with audiences
*15:58.680- 16:00.360* :  and capitals in Washington, DC,
*16:00.900- 16:02.260* :  maybe that's another reason she's gone?
*16:02.400- 16:05.800* :  I think the government is trying to both appeal to its population,
*16:06.600- 16:08.280* :  saying, look, when we mobilise you,
*16:08.280- 16:09.360* :  when we call you up to fight,
*16:09.820- 16:12.320* :  we are doing so through a system that is credible.
*16:12.880- 16:14.460* :  But there was also an international audience
*16:14.460- 16:16.760* :  that President Zelensky is pandering to as well.
*16:17.560- 16:20.400* :  He and Ukraine have long had political ambitions
*16:20.440- 16:23.120* :  of joining the European Union and NATO.
*16:23.120- 16:25.400* :  It is continuing to receive billions of dollars
*16:25.400- 16:27.140* :  of military and humanitarian aid.
*16:27.720- 16:29.380* :  This feeds into that as well.
*16:29.480- 16:31.860* :  Just one quickly, on those operational issues
*16:31.860- 16:32.940* :  are on the battlefield.
*16:32.940- 16:35.460* :  Are we seeing signs today, perhaps, of some successes
*16:36.180- 16:38.000* :  in in Bakhmut or is that not the case?
*16:38.400- 16:40.940* :  We are seeing probing attacks.
*16:40.940- 16:42.460* :  Well, they go beyond probing, really.
*16:42.840- 16:45.460* :  Certainly we've seen two villages taking south of Bakhmut.
*16:45.460- 16:51.940* :  We've seen Ukrainian infantry sustain a sizeable land grab,
*16:51.940- 16:55.280* :  south of Zapadizia, where it is desperately hoping to punch through.
*16:55.320- 16:57.700* :  But that punch we have not seen yet.
*16:57.800- 17:00.500* :  They've broken through the Russian first lines of defence.
*17:00.500- 17:03.960* :  But I think the most interesting area we are seeing at the moment
*17:03.960- 17:07.660* :  are these successful missile attacks by the Ukrainians
*17:07.800- 17:09.020* :  on targets in Crimea.
*17:09.020- 17:11.600* :  When we're talking about naval bases,
*17:11.700- 17:14.040* :  when we're talking about Russian air defence systems,
*17:14.420- 17:15.860* :  you can see what is happening here.
*17:16.220- 17:17.180* :  There is the bread and butter
*17:17.180- 17:19.540* :  of trying to liberate territory kilometer by kilometer.
*17:20.200- 17:22.320* :  But they are also trying to isolate Russian troops
*17:22.320- 17:26.100* :  by taking out air defence systems, supply lines,
*17:26.140- 17:29.240* :  to bring the question of Crimea into question.
*17:29.240- 17:31.280* :  At the moment, Robin, it is Crimea.
*17:31.940- 17:33.920* :  A place Russia has tried to portray as a fortress,
*17:33.920- 17:37.220* :  which is looking more fragile for the occupiers at the moment.
*17:37.640- 17:38.940* :  James Waterhouse in Ukraine.
*17:39.920- 17:42.300* :  The US military has appealed to the public
*17:42.300- 17:45.320* :  to help it find an advanced stealth fighter jet
*17:45.660- 17:46.340* :  that's gone missing.
*17:46.940- 17:50.200* :  Officials say the F-35 war plane simply vanished
*17:50.200- 17:52.580* :  following what's been described as a mishap
*17:52.900- 17:54.340* :  over the state of South Carolina.
*17:54.720- 17:56.200* :  The pilot ejected safely.
*17:56.560- 17:59.240* :  An North America correspondent, Gary O'Donohue, has more.
*17:59.780- 18:01.380* :  At $80 million a pop,
*18:01.380- 18:04.420* :  the F-35 Lightning 2's joint strike fighter
*18:04.780- 18:07.260* :  is not the kind of thing you want to lose if you can help it.
*18:07.680- 18:10.960* :  But that's exactly what the US Marine Corps seems to have done.
*18:11.580- 18:13.620* :  Not on the hostile environment of the battlefield,
*18:13.620- 18:15.180* :  taking incoming fire,
*18:15.660- 18:18.040* :  but somewhere over a small part of South Carolina.
*18:18.860- 18:21.300* :  Fighter attack training squadron 501
*18:21.640- 18:22.960* :  released a statement yesterday
*18:22.960- 18:25.060* :  after the pilot ejected from the plane,
*18:25.060- 18:27.680* :  describing the incident as a mishap
*18:28.100- 18:30.280* :  and asking for the public's help to find it.
*18:30.840- 18:32.420* :  The Marine Corps was tight-lipped
*18:32.420- 18:35.220* :  on whether the plane's transponder was activated or not,
*18:35.220- 18:37.500* :  which should allow them to locate it.
*18:37.900- 18:39.780* :  More worryingly, questions to the military
*18:39.780- 18:42.020* :  have elicited a resounding silence
*18:42.520- 18:44.660* :  on whether the jet was carrying any armaments.
*18:45.400- 18:47.420* :  The search is focused around two lakes
*18:47.420- 18:48.860* :  between the cities of Charleston
*18:49.200- 18:50.740* :  and the state capital Columbia,
*18:51.200- 18:53.240* :  a distance of about 100 miles,
*18:53.800- 18:55.020* :  but so far to no avail.
*18:55.660- 18:57.660* :  And to save anyone the trouble of looking it up,
*18:57.660- 19:00.320* :  it's not all that close to the Bermuda Triangle.
*19:00.940- 19:01.580* :  Gary O'Donohue.
*19:04.820- 19:05.300* :  Still to come.
*19:12.300- 19:14.940* :  Do you find those sounds really irritating?
*19:14.940- 19:16.820* :  I definitely find the second one irritating.
*19:17.340- 19:18.620* :  Well, help maybe at hand.
*19:26.920- 19:30.000* :  This ACAST podcast is sponsored by NetSuite,

*20:09.320- 20:10.960* :  Our planet's climate is changing.
*20:11.080- 20:12.820* :  We are in the midst of a climate crisis.
*20:12.940- 20:15.280* :  The climate question speaks to those hit the hardest.
*20:15.280- 20:17.400* :  The problems caused by deforestation
*20:17.400- 20:18.880* :  and the environment are huge.
*20:19.080- 20:21.200* :  We end big trouble and asks what we can do
*20:21.400- 20:22.900* :  to soften the impact for the future.
*20:22.900- 20:25.680* :  We do hope the means to do something about this.
*20:25.860- 20:28.320* :  Try and reduce the relative fossil fuels.
*20:28.600- 20:30.180* :  Way more wind and solar.
*20:30.300- 20:32.260* :  I do have a lot of faith for the future.

*20:39.620- 20:42.480* :  We've been reporting a lot from Libya in the last week.
*20:42.620- 20:45.800* :  And we're going to go back to Dernar in eastern Libya now,
*20:46.200- 20:48.040* :  where hundreds of people have taken to the streets
*20:48.040- 20:51.460* :  to demand accountability for the devastating floods
*20:51.460- 20:53.940* :  which swept through the city a week ago.
*20:54.160- 20:57.000* :  Thousands of people died when two dams collapsed.
*20:57.500- 20:59.500* :  Rescue workers are still pulling bodies
*20:59.500- 21:01.420* :  from the sea and ruined buildings.
*21:02.060- 21:03.680* :  Our correspondent Anna Foster is there.
*21:03.860- 21:04.680* :  She sent this report.
*21:06.320- 21:08.820* :  Turkish rescuers have brought us into this
*21:09.100- 21:10.540* :  normally sealed-off zone,
*21:11.100- 21:13.260* :  where they are searching for victims.
*21:13.360- 21:15.500* :  They're using all of the experience that they brought
*21:15.500- 21:17.580* :  from the earthquake in Turkey back in February.
*21:18.200- 21:21.580* :  And in this area, you can see how high the water came
*21:22.500- 21:23.460* :  into these buildings.
*21:23.460- 21:27.680* :  There are tree roots and branches 20 to 30 meters above the ground.
*21:27.680- 21:30.580* :  And they've recovered victims from the fifth
*21:30.580- 21:33.060* :  and sixth stories of these apartment blocks.
*21:33.820- 21:36.880* :  And the sound that you can hear is heavy lifting equipment
*21:36.880- 21:39.400* :  that is finding new channels, new ways
*21:39.960- 21:42.720* :  for them to get inside and search for more victims.
*21:46.180- 21:50.100* :  Amid the grief and anger is that urgent task of rebuilding lives.
*21:50.580- 21:53.700* :  Figures from the UN say tens of thousands of survivors
*21:53.700- 21:55.500* :  have been displaced by the flooding.
*21:56.000- 21:58.580* :  Some have left Dürner, others are living with family
*21:59.020- 22:02.140* :  and buildings like this school have been repurposed as shelters.
*22:08.160- 22:11.500* :  It's quite noisy and echoey here in the school corridor
*22:11.500- 22:12.480* :  where the children are playing.
*22:13.080- 22:14.420* :  But if we walk into one of the classrooms
*22:15.840- 22:18.540* :  through the doorway and past a blanket
*22:18.540- 22:21.500* :  that's been hung up over the tables to give just a little bit of privacy
*22:22.320- 22:25.200* :  this is where families are living and obviously
*22:25.200- 22:28.280* :  they don't have really any of their possessions.
*22:28.280- 22:31.300* :  Everything was washed away but you can see where
*22:31.660- 22:34.540* :  there are donated mattresses, donated blankets
*22:34.540- 22:37.800* :  and families now sleeping in each of these classrooms
*22:38.620- 22:40.600* :  all the way along the school corridor.
*22:41.340- 22:44.320* :  Anna Foster in Dürner, while there is continuing controversy
*22:44.340- 22:48.300* :  and so many questions about why those two dams above the
*22:48.300- 22:51.180* :  city failed with such devastating consequences.
*22:51.860- 22:54.660* :  The head of the Eastern Administration in divided Libya
*22:54.660- 22:57.900* :  has blamed nature for the failure of the two dams.
*22:58.260- 23:02.000* :  But the Libyan hydrologist Abdul Wani Sashore disagrees
*23:02.620- 23:05.820* :  and he's been speaking to my colleague Julia Marshall via a translator.
*23:10.500- 23:14.320* :  Today I've been looking at the designs of the architect company
*23:14.320- 23:19.760* :  that designed these dams and actually their report from 1970
*23:20.520- 23:23.900* :  has recommended building three dams not just two
*23:24.400- 23:29.060* :  because the company building the dams and recommending this design
*23:29.980- 23:32.520* :  recommended three different dams
*23:33.020- 23:35.740* :  but the government of Libya only built two
*23:36.420- 23:38.780* :  and did not go ahead with building the third one.
*23:38.780- 23:41.600* :  So these two were overloaded and particular
*23:41.600- 23:44.760* :  said the woman sewer been overloaded hydrologically
*23:44.820- 23:46.860* :  with more water than it can contain
*23:47.580- 23:49.400* :  and that's what led to this disaster
*23:49.400- 23:52.840* :  and inundating Dürner with all these flood waters.
*23:53.200- 23:55.440* :  And the documents released this week show a contract
*23:55.440- 23:57.600* :  with this suit to a Turkish company
*23:57.660- 24:02.940* :  in 2020 to strengthen both dams yet no work was done.
*24:03.480- 24:04.500* :  We were aware of this?
*24:05.000- 24:08.740* :  No, I don't know, this is from the early 2010s.
*24:08.880- 24:12.960* :  I've been aware of this since 2010, not just 2020.
*24:12.960- 24:18.640* :  I've been a professor at Omer Al-Mokhtar University, Dürner campus.
*24:19.380- 24:22.920* :  So ever since 2010 I've been driving on that road,
*24:22.920- 24:25.220* :  I've been driving over the body of the dam
*24:25.660- 24:28.960* :  and I remember seeing the Turkish company operating there
*24:28.960- 24:32.760* :  it started functioning there to strengthen the body of the dam
*24:33.440- 24:36.320* :  in 2010 but came 2011 with the Arab Spring
*24:36.320- 24:39.300* :  the Libyan revolution so they stopped everything
*24:39.300- 24:41.980* :  and they up the sticks and removed all the equipment
*24:42.520- 24:43.600* :  so work had stopped.
*24:44.080- 24:48.820* :  Came 2020 and the company came back having been given a new contract
*24:48.820- 24:52.420* :  at new cost and nothing had been done since
*24:52.420- 24:53.680* :  even though they got the contract
*24:53.680- 24:54.940* :  but they hadn't started working.
*24:55.520- 24:58.360* :  The Libyan hydrologist Abdul Wanis Ashul.
*24:58.920- 25:01.860* :  Now scientists here in the UK in Scotland say they've discovered
*25:01.860- 25:05.360* :  an alternative to an ingredient that is estimated to be in
*25:05.600- 25:08.020* :  half of all food and cosmetic products
*25:08.700- 25:11.280* :  and it's blamed as well for deforestation across the world.
*25:11.860- 25:15.220* :  A research team from Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh
*25:15.220- 25:19.220* :  say their alternative to palm oil is actually healthier for humans.
*25:19.880- 25:23.220* :  They also say it would mean significant environmental benefits
*25:23.220- 25:26.140* :  in places where natural forest habitat has been replaced
*25:26.680- 25:28.440* :  with vast palm oil plantations.
*25:29.100- 25:31.620* :  One of the lead developers on the project Katrina Little
*25:31.900- 25:33.740* :  has been telling my colleague Evan Davis more.
*25:34.300- 25:38.120* :  Pamol is a very cultivated product that's grown in various
*25:38.340- 25:41.120* :  exotic areas of the planet and it's very saturated
*25:41.120- 25:43.480* :  and it's also really quite unsustainable.
*25:43.660- 25:46.180* :  So we've created a product that's a lot more sustainable
*25:46.460- 25:48.620* :  around about 70% less carbon emissions
*25:49.420- 25:53.100* :  and it's considerably healthier so we've been able to get a 30%
*25:53.200- 25:56.900* :  calorie reduction, 30% fat reduction and over 80%
*25:56.900- 25:58.560* :  saturated fat reduction.
*25:58.780- 26:00.220* :  And what is it? What is your product?
*26:00.360- 26:03.200* :  It's a combination of leapsed oil and some clever
*26:03.200- 26:04.140* :  fibres and proteins.
*26:04.420- 26:07.280* :  Right and I mean as I understand it a palm oil
*26:07.280- 26:11.120* :  which is used ubiquitously in food and and cosmetics
*26:12.060- 26:14.560* :  is very difficult to replace so this is something
*26:14.560- 26:16.840* :  have been a long hard search for scientists.
*26:17.540- 26:20.980* :  Yeah I mean the two things is two different goals here.
*26:20.980- 26:23.080* :  One is sustainability thing and the other is the health one.
*26:23.500- 26:25.360* :  Some people are going just for this sustainability thing
*26:25.940- 26:28.580* :  and we're trying to do both at the same time so it is a challenge
*26:28.620- 26:31.180* :  but we've actually tested this out in a number of different products
*26:31.460- 26:34.020* :  mostly bakery so cakes, biscuits, shortbread,
*26:34.680- 26:37.960* :  those kind of things and we put it through a what's called a
*26:38.100- 26:40.000* :  specialist sensory panel so our trained panel
*26:40.480- 26:42.000* :  and they can't distinguish the difference.
*26:42.200- 26:44.840* :  Catherine it just explains to me why we use palm oil so much
*26:44.840- 26:46.740* :  why we need a replacement for it and why
*26:47.400- 26:49.500* :  we don't just use less of it and just have because you know
*26:49.500- 26:51.760* :  when we cook at home we don't put a palm oil into things.
*26:52.020- 26:55.240* :  What do you do? That's the thing because it's in so many of the ingredients
*26:55.240- 26:58.120* :  you cook with as well so it's sent everything from margarine
*26:59.120- 27:03.020* :  to cake to sauces to peanut butter it's in everything really
*27:03.020- 27:05.640* :  it's in a lot of different products so you are by definition
*27:05.640- 27:08.340* :  cooking the palm flour anyway. Why do we use so much of it?
*27:08.340- 27:12.000* :  It's as opposed to other forms of fat. It's very functional
*27:12.000- 27:15.220* :  it gives you really good texture and flavor and your end product
*27:15.540- 27:19.180* :  gives you great shelf life and you know so for all these things it's
*27:19.180- 27:21.540* :  like a really functional ingredient so it's a shame
*27:21.540- 27:23.660* :  that it's just really unhealthy and it's not very sustainable
*27:23.860- 27:27.340* :  but function is a great ingredient to use from a taste and
*27:27.340- 27:30.340* :  texture for a point of view. Katrina little on a
*27:30.340- 27:34.880* :  replacement for the ubiquitous palm oil. Now I'm sorry about this
*27:35.160- 27:38.180* :  quite a few people have an irrational hatred of certain
*27:38.180- 27:42.200* :  everyday sounds and if that sounds like you you might find the following
*27:42.200- 27:43.760* :  noises slightly jarring.
*28:00.440- 28:02.620* :  It's the appellating I really don't like the appellating
*28:03.060- 28:06.500* :  well for those of you with this condition you'll be pleased that it has a name
*28:07.080- 28:11.580* :  misophonia is what it's called and a new book sounds like misophonia examines
*28:11.580- 28:15.440* :  the phenomenon. The author has led a study that concludes that nearly one in
*28:15.440- 28:19.680* :  five people have it in some form. Jane Gregory wrote the book
*28:19.980- 28:23.340* :  from the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford
*28:23.340- 28:28.400* :  and Evan Davis asked her what her personal experience with misophonia is.
*28:28.880- 28:34.460* :  When I was younger it was like a real rage I just got an instant flash of anger
*28:34.460- 28:38.340* :  when I heard these sounds and couldn't concentrate on anything else I remember
*28:38.340- 28:43.020* :  at school I used to have to I had a walkman that I would like feed up through
*28:43.280- 28:46.080* :  my school uniform and had the clanking tape in my pocket
*28:46.080- 28:49.860* :  playing music so that I could literally so I could concentrate in class
*28:49.900- 28:54.040* :  because of the clicking pens and all the rustling of paper and all that sort of stuff.
*28:54.400- 28:59.440* :  Nowadays the main way it affects me is if I'm really trying to concentrate and there's a ticking
*28:59.440- 29:05.300* :  clock or pigeons outside my window or something pulling my attention away that's when I get the
*29:05.300- 29:10.540* :  most frustrated but I don't get that intense rage anymore but I know that a lot of people get
*29:10.580- 29:14.240* :  that sort of feeling of anger or panic in response to these sounds. Yeah that sound
*29:14.240- 29:19.840* :  much more serious. I have a particular thing with with chewing gum I I'm okay if I'm chewing gum
*29:20.000- 29:23.880* :  and someone else is chewing gum if they're chewing gum and I'm not chewing gum I do feel
*29:24.660- 29:29.920* :  intense irritation but I wonder how much I should blame myself for that of just being perhaps
*29:29.920- 29:34.840* :  a bit intolerant it's different for chewing gum I do find that irritating I don't find it annoying
*29:34.840- 29:39.860* :  if they're eating an apple or if they're drinking a glass of water but what is the difference
*29:39.860- 29:44.520* :  between just being intolerant and annoyed easily annoyed and having misophonia.
*29:44.860- 29:48.660* :  It seems to be something slightly different happening in the brain in misophonia so it's not
*29:48.660- 29:54.500* :  just feeling annoyed but it's that the brain has somehow sort of paired these sounds with a really
*29:54.500- 29:59.680* :  intense emotional reaction so almost like a fight or flight kind of response so it's not just being
*29:59.680- 30:04.440* :  annoyed and most people could relate to being annoyed it's more that really intense sort of physical
*30:05.180- 30:10.620* :  reaction and something just different happening in the brain which they've shown in studies using
*30:10.620- 30:14.360* :  brain scans that you can actually see different connections happening in the brain when people react
*30:14.360- 30:20.380* :  to misophonia. Okay so that is useful to know. Now what do you do about it? What is the best
*30:20.440- 30:26.720* :  way of living in human society where these noises are routine and you're you're going to be very
*30:26.720- 30:32.000* :  unlucky to stop people making any any kinds of sounds clearing their throats or coughing or
*30:32.600- 30:37.360* :  clicking a pen. What's the best way of treating it? Yeah they're really normal human sounds so it is
*30:37.360- 30:42.160* :  pretty hard to tell people to just stop living basically because most people aren't doing these sounds
*30:42.160- 30:46.880* :  deliberately and sometimes the sounds are excessive but you're right it's really hard to tell people
*30:46.880- 30:53.140* :  to stop doing those sounds. So on a day-to-day basis lots of people in misophonia just have earplugs
*30:53.180- 30:57.800* :  or headphones or something ready to go with them if they need to be able to concentrate or get away
*30:57.800- 31:02.800* :  from a sound. For sort of a longer term change and this is one of the things that I talk about in
*31:02.800- 31:08.140* :  the book is is actually trying to create new experiences with those sounds so that you can change
*31:08.140- 31:13.780* :  those brain connections and actually get a less intense reaction to the sounds. What's
*31:13.780- 31:17.700* :  gone wrong with the brain that it suffers from this? It's interesting isn't it? I mean is there some
*31:18.360- 31:23.360* :  evolutionary reason that you can think of why the brain might overreact? I can see why people get
*31:23.360- 31:27.920* :  terrified of spiders or snakes you know these can be dangerous but a clicking pen for goodness
*31:27.920- 31:32.340* :  sake how can that be what what's going on in the head that that would that that would occur?
*31:33.040- 31:36.420* :  Yeah well it's like if you use the example of spiders and snakes that's a really good example
*31:36.420- 31:42.080* :  because it's reasonable to be afraid of spiders and snakes but also if you live in a country where
*31:42.080- 31:46.440* :  spiders aren't dangerous and you still have a really intense fear reaction as though they are
*31:46.440- 31:52.960* :  really dangerous then your brain has made a connection with spiders that is disproportionate to
*31:53.380- 31:57.380* :  the actual level of danger and that's probably a better comparison for misophonia is that these
*31:57.380- 32:01.420* :  are sounds that if you're walking home late at night it would be really good for your brain to be
*32:01.420- 32:05.400* :  able to tune into footsteps so you could hear if someone was following you or something like that
*32:05.820- 32:09.860* :  long ago when we were living out on the plains being able to see it rustle in the grass of a
*32:09.860- 32:14.880* :  potential predator or something like that being able to tune into these sounds does have a survival
*32:14.880- 32:19.400* :  feature for the group so it makes sense that some of us pay attention to these sounds and don't
*32:19.400- 32:25.280* :  tune them out but just like somebody who can't even look at a picture of a spider even though
*32:25.660- 32:29.100* :  they live in a country where spiders aren't dangerous some people with misophonia react to those
*32:29.100- 32:34.040* :  sounds as if there is immediate danger or threat or violation or some kind of social threat maybe
*32:34.440- 32:40.540* :  which is disproportionate to the level of danger. Jane Gregory from Oxford University.
*32:41.360- 32:45.980* :  Now let's end on the Italian fishing industry which is battling a plague of blue crabs,
*32:46.620- 32:52.060* :  an invasive and predatory species that has been having a dramatic impact on traditional
*32:52.060- 32:58.720* :  shellfish production of the Italian coast. Some reports suggest as many as 90% of Italy's young
*32:58.720- 33:04.160* :  clams have been devoured by the crabs but one person's invasive pest is another person's
*33:04.160- 33:10.860* :  culinary opportunity it seems. Tim Franks spoke to Yim Hung Su, a specialist on Korean food
*33:10.860- 33:17.260* :  and director of the Korean culture and art center in the UK. Maybe it could be a disaster to
*33:17.260- 33:24.120* :  Italian people but in the view of a Korean site it is kind of festival. A festival in what way?
*33:25.040- 33:32.160* :  Festival in a delicious way because the Korean people really loves the crabs and they are
*33:32.160- 33:39.780* :  making many different types of foods with the crabs. So at the moment when Korean people heard
*33:39.780- 33:47.460* :  about the blue crab crisis in Italia why they are getting rid of the blue crabs because we
*33:47.460- 33:53.520* :  can enjoy the crabs. So in other words the Italians, South Koreans are thinking the Italians are
*33:53.520- 33:59.260* :  mad to throw this stuff away because it's absolutely delicious. Is there a hope in South
*33:59.260- 34:04.960* :  Korea that even if the Italians don't have a taste for the blue crab that they'll end up being
*34:05.100- 34:12.520* :  exported to South Korea? So they are trying to import blue crabs from Italia to Korea.
*34:12.800- 34:19.460* :  It's very cheap prices but I tried in Tunisia last year. It was great, it could make prices
*34:19.460- 34:28.080* :  in the blue crab, it can defry it, we can steam it and we can shallow fry it, so fry it many,
*34:28.080- 34:34.600* :  many different ways to enjoy the blue crabs. Right, so that's fascinating. So you went to Tunisia
*34:35.120- 34:41.480* :  recently in order to taste the blue crab. I mean presumably this is an invasive species for Tunisia
*34:41.660- 34:50.420* :  as well. Same species. Same species, yeah, but not native to the waters of North Africa and
*34:50.420- 34:56.320* :  what was Tunisia doing with the blue crab? Was it being, I mean I can't believe it's much part
*34:56.320- 35:02.820* :  of Tunisian cuisine, so were they exporting the blue crab to South Korea? Yes, they also had a big
*35:02.820- 35:09.580* :  problem with the blue crabs. The embassy of Korea in Tunisia, they found the blue crab. It was
*35:09.580- 35:17.840* :  like a treasure, so they introduced the blue crab to Korea market. Now they are selling many tons
*35:17.840- 35:24.680* :  of blue crab to South Korea at the moment. You mentioned several ways of using the blue crab
*35:25.380- 35:31.880* :  in food dishes, but there's one dish that I will now mispronounce, which is kanjanggejang.
*35:32.860- 35:39.340* :  Right, your pronunciation is almost as good as mine. Tell me about this one other dish which I think
*35:39.340- 35:45.880* :  is a particular specialty. So kanjanggejang means the salty fermented crab in Korean cuisine.
*35:46.300- 35:52.820* :  So basically we are using very salty soy sauce and also we are adding some flavor with garlic,
*35:52.820- 36:01.860* :  ginger, spring onions, pear, pepper. This is very salty but very tasty and many people are calling
*36:01.860- 36:10.480* :  kanjanggejang is the rice thief because that kanjanggejang is made us to eat more rice than normal.
*36:10.480- 36:18.300* :  It is really amazingly great and very tasty. Yim Hungsoo from the Korean culture and art center
*36:18.300- 36:25.940* :  in the UK on his country's love for the blue crab. Right, that's all from us for now but there
