01:02.900 - 01:07.240:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Saturday the 9th of
01:07.640 - 01:13.660:  September. The UN says the system for tackling global warming is working, but nowhere near
01:13.660 - 01:19.020:  fast enough. Documents released in the US state of Georgia show the grand jury in the Trump
01:19.020 - 01:25.020:  racketeering case also recommended inditing Senator Lindsey Graham, and the American scientist who's
01:25.020 - 01:30.800:  fallen ill in one of Turkey's deepest caves. As you can see, I'm up on the word I'm talking,
01:32.160 - 01:36.460:  I'm not healed on the inside yet, so I'm going to need a lot of help to get out of here.
01:38.680 - 01:44.120:  Also, in the podcast, Pakistan says advanced weapons left behind in Afghanistan after the US
01:44.120 - 01:50.600:  troop withdrawal and now being used against its soldiers. And the Mercury Music Award goes to...
01:58.900 - 02:01.420:  The first jazz band to get the prestigious prize.
02:05.380 - 02:10.520:  The world is currently way off target in its efforts to prevent dangerous global warming.
02:10.520 - 02:15.440:  That is the conclusion of the first official progress report on reaching the Paris climate goals.
02:15.500 - 02:21.440:  In its global stocktake, the UN concludes that the world needs a rapid transformation in the way
02:21.440 - 02:28.620:  we work, eat, travel and consume energy. At a news conference at the G20 summit of wealthy nations
02:28.620 - 02:34.560:  in the Indian capital, Delhi, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the call for
02:34.560 - 02:41.760:  action was urgent and could no longer be ignored. We have no time to lose. The climate crisis is
02:41.760 - 02:49.540:  worsening dramatic, but the collective response is lacking in ambition, credibility and urgency.
02:49.540 - 02:55.860:  The climate crisis is paralleling out of control. Together, G20 countries are responsible for
02:55.860 - 03:00.720:  80 percent of global emissions. So G20 countries must assume leadership.
03:01.580 - 03:07.160:  Antonio Guterres, the report does suggest that hope isn't yet lost with many countries,
03:07.160 - 03:11.700:  even those divided by war, working together to tackle global warming.
03:11.700 - 03:15.860:  Your Regal is a climate scientist from Imperial College London.
03:16.320 - 03:20.800:  I'm in the place of hope in despair. Despair because we have warmed the planet already well
03:20.800 - 03:27.520:  beyond one degrees. These are varying places to be in. I also have hope because we see how countries
03:27.520 - 03:34.280:  are putting together real plans to change their entire economies, to change their entire societies,
03:34.900 - 03:36.740:  and we see how they are being implemented.
03:37.360 - 03:41.860:  Well, for his assessment, I spoke to our climate editor Justin Rolatt, starting with the reasons
03:41.860 - 03:47.720:  for optimism. Yeah, let's start with the good. It's always a good way to begin. If you were an
03:47.720 - 03:51.760:  anian looking at the world and looking at the challenge of tackling climate change, you said,
03:51.760 - 03:57.180:  what needs to be done? The first that you'd say is all these weird nations. This planet has
03:57.360 - 04:02.200:  need to work together. And what the UN's saying today is that is happening. That was the plan
04:02.200 - 04:06.900:  after the big UN conference in Paris in 2015. The plan was to get everybody working together
04:07.260 - 04:11.300:  on this and the UN says, look, virtually every country on Earth acknowledges that climate
04:11.300 - 04:16.100:  change is a huge challenge and needs to be tackled urgently and is already taking some action.
04:16.100 - 04:19.740:  The bad news is we're simply not doing it fast enough at the moment.
04:19.740 - 04:26.620:  In what way? We need, says the UN, to switch massively over to clean technology, to renewable power.
04:26.620 - 04:31.920:  We need to phase down fossil fuels as quickly as possible, unless the carbon dioxide emissions are
04:31.920 - 04:36.780:  captured and stored permanently underground. We need to stop deforestation by 2030 and begin
04:36.780 - 04:42.580:  to replant the forests we've lost. We need to change the way agriculture works. We need a systemic
04:42.580 - 04:47.240:  global overhaul is what the UN says. And it's very frank about this. It says, look, this is going
04:47.240 - 04:50.880:  to be really expensive. It's going to cost trillions of dollars. It says the developed countries
04:50.880 - 04:54.680:  will need to help developing countries. We need the private sector to get on board. But it says
04:54.680 - 04:59.940:  we do have the technologies we need to do this. We just need to begin to implement them
04:59.940 - 05:05.780:  with more ambition and drive. It can be done, it says. So what's holding us up? A lack of money,
05:05.780 - 05:11.380:  a lack of political will. A lack of political will is holding us up, a lack of cash flowing into
05:11.380 - 05:16.440:  the right places. I mean, this is a call to action for world leaders ahead of the big climate
05:16.440 - 05:20.780:  conference, COP28, that's going to happen in the United Arab Emirates. And they're saying,
05:20.780 - 05:25.500:  you know, enough of the big speeches. Let's see action. Let's see strategic plans for how you're
05:25.500 - 05:29.100:  going to deliver on the commitments. 90% of the world has said they are going to try and get to
05:29.100 - 05:33.160:  net zero. Okay, so you want to get to net zero? How are you going to do it? Please outline what
05:33.160 - 05:36.540:  you're going to do. And then start to actually deliver on the targets that are embedded in those
05:36.540 - 05:41.660:  strategic plans. That's what the UN wants to see. You mentioned the money. Hundreds of billions
05:41.660 - 05:46.740:  are still spent on fossil fuels and not enough on... I mean, more than hundreds of billions
05:46.740 - 05:51.660:  of fossil fuel, hundreds of billions of subsidies for fossil fuels by governments. And the UN says,
05:51.660 - 05:55.820:  first of all, let's get rid of that. Let's try and phase it out. It's a real dilemma. There is a
05:55.820 - 06:00.240:  recognition that countries like India, this is something Narendra Modi's been saying, will need
06:00.240 - 06:05.000:  fossil fuels to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. And there is a recognition
06:05.000 - 06:10.580:  by the UN that they cannot be denied that right to deliver development for their people,
06:10.580 - 06:16.000:  but it says we do need to make the transition happen as quickly as possible. That's the real
06:16.000 - 06:20.420:  sense of urgency that needs to be engendered firstly at the G20 and then they need to bring that
06:20.420 - 06:25.220:  enthusiasm and energy to the COP28 in UAE in which begins at the end of November.
06:25.660 - 06:31.140:  Our climate editor Justin Rolatt. Well, scientists say climate change is making extreme weather
06:31.140 - 06:36.520:  much more likely. One of the worst affected countries at the moment is Greece. After a record,
06:36.520 - 06:41.800:  summer heat wave and a series of wildfires, it was hit this week by torrential floods that killed
06:41.800 - 06:46.560:  at least ten people. During a visit to one of the worst affected areas on Friday, the Greek
06:46.560 - 06:52.760:  Prime Minister, Karyakos Mitzoldakis, warned that the country was facing a very unequal battle with
06:52.760 - 06:59.900:  nature. So, he abetted reports from Greece. Entire villages are almost completely underwater
07:00.640 - 07:05.900:  after the area was hit by the heaviest rainfall the country has seen in decades.
07:06.860 - 07:13.240:  Homes have been swept away, others are without power and several roads have been badly damaged.
07:14.220 - 07:18.720:  Even though the rain has eased, many people are still trapped on their roofs.
07:20.640 - 07:27.560:  In some areas, helicopters are being deployed to take people to safety. We find Senja outside her
07:27.560 - 07:33.660:  house. She's lived there with her family for more than 30 years. Now her home is completely
07:33.660 - 07:41.760:  submerged in flood water. I never thought this could have happened that my house would be under
07:41.760 - 07:47.220:  one and a half meters of water. My home is completely destroyed. I have nothing left.
07:47.220 - 07:52.320:  All I have is my work, this house and my children. And now our home is gone.
07:52.880 - 07:59.520:  Climate change is causing more extreme weather. Greece faced its worst summer of wildfires on record.
08:00.380 - 08:06.920:  Many people hear a furious at the Greek authorities. They accuse ministers of using climate change
08:06.920 - 08:13.300:  as an excuse for poor building projects. I'm standing next to a bridge near the town of Almiros.
08:13.760 - 08:20.260:  It collapsed three years ago, so they rebuilt it. But now it's completely destroyed again.
08:21.020 - 08:24.900:  Many Greeks see this as a symbol of government failure.
08:28.040 - 08:34.800:  Emergency services are still unable to reach many of the worst-hit areas because the water is so
08:34.800 - 08:42.200:  deep. Teams are preparing for another night of rescue operations. But the concern is that the
08:42.200 - 08:49.680:  number of dead will increase further. Sofia Betts are in Greece. The new military rulers in the
08:49.680 - 08:54.780:  West African state of Gabon have moved faster than other co-leaders in the region to give their
08:54.780 - 09:01.620:  regime a civilian veneer, appointing a prime minister in a transitional government. Gabon's
09:01.620 - 09:07.100:  president, Ali Bongo, was ousted by soldiers last week after disputed election results gave him
09:07.100 - 09:13.680:  victory. The newly appointed prime minister, Remont & Dong Sima, is an opposition leader who was
09:13.680 - 09:18.180:  defeated in those elections. The announcement was made on state TV on Thursday.
09:28.440 - 09:34.000:  At the same time, Ali Bongo has been told he is now free to leave the country. While the coup
09:34.000 - 09:40.720:  leader has pledged a return to civilian rule, albeit without giving a time scale. Using a translator,
09:40.720 - 09:46.460:  my colleague Julian Marshall spoke to Remont & Dong Sima. First of all, why did he accept the post
09:46.460 - 09:54.320:  of prime minister in a transitional government led by the military? Because the situation is
09:54.320 - 10:02.200:  a very tense and everyone has to make a near-fort to make change. The new military rulers of Gabon
10:02.200 - 10:10.160:  have not named a timetable for a transition to democracy. How confident are you that Gabon
10:10.400 - 10:18.280:  will see a democratically elected government maybe in a few years time? The military committee
10:18.280 - 10:25.940:  said that it was up to the civil society and political parties to meet and set out the
10:25.940 - 10:31.760:  timetable for the elections and to come back to the democratic rule. In coming days,
10:31.760 - 10:37.980:  there will be a meeting with all the components of the 30 to meet to set out that. Do you yourself
10:37.980 - 10:45.420:  have timetable in your mind for a return to democracy? I was said in a document that I've
10:45.420 - 10:52.880:  published that, that should be done within two years. The new leader of Gabon, Bruce Oligian Gema,
10:52.880 - 11:01.080:  is a cousin of Ali Bongo. So has the military coup ended the political influence of the Bongo
11:01.080 - 11:08.160:  family in Gabon? No, you cannot enter the political influence of a family that has ruled for
11:08.160 - 11:14.640:  over 50 years in one day because they are in direct influence. So what has changed in Gabon,
11:14.800 - 11:21.980:  therefore? What has changed is that the military has refused to beat up the population and we have
11:21.980 - 11:26.740:  a promise that we will look into the institutions that come back to the democratic rule.
11:27.080 - 11:35.640:  Should Ali Bongo be allowed to travel abroad as the military government indicated yesterday that
11:35.640 - 11:45.360:  he could or should he remain in Gabon and be tried for gross embezzlement? What is interesting for
11:45.360 - 11:51.020:  people is not to open the case. I don't think it will be viable to open the case at this moment.
11:51.940 - 11:56.900:  Gabon's new interim prime minister, Raymond and Don Cima, talking to Julian Marshall.
11:57.800 - 12:02.780:  Last month, the former US president Donald Trump was charged with racketeering in the state of
12:02.780 - 12:09.240:  Georgia. He and 18 co-defendants were accused of trying to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 election
12:09.240 - 12:14.820:  victory there. On Friday, we learned that the special grand jury in the case had also recommended
12:14.820 - 12:20.460:  inditing 20 others, including US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. Also in the frame,
12:20.460 - 12:25.460:  were former senators Kelly Leffler and David Perdue, as well as Mr Trump's former national security
12:25.460 - 12:31.180:  adviser and three lawyers. But the district attorney decided not to pursue charges against them.
12:31.400 - 12:36.420:  I asked our Washington correspondent Gary O'Donohue why the jurors had recommended those
12:36.420 - 12:41.100:  indictments in the first place. We don't know what their reasoning was because that's not been
12:41.100 - 12:45.880:  published and we don't know what the evidence they saw was. What we really have is just the outcomes
12:45.880 - 12:51.680:  and this special grand jury is spent seven months effectively investigating the allegations.
12:51.680 - 12:57.920:  And at the end of that process, they came up with recommendations which involved charging 39 people,
12:58.360 - 13:04.800:  including the 19 who were finally charged, but also three Republican senators, one who's still
13:04.800 - 13:10.320:  serving Lindsey Graham, two former Georgia Republican senators, and Donald Trump's former national
13:10.320 - 13:15.060:  security adviser Michael Flynn. Now, Fanny Willis who's the district attorney in Fulton County
13:15.060 - 13:21.120:  down there in Atlanta, she wasn't obliged to go along with all those charges and all those
13:21.120 - 13:27.360:  indictments that that first grand jury recommended and she set up an indictment involving the 19
13:27.360 - 13:32.820:  and took that to this final grand jury who effectively robustamped the indictment. That's the
13:32.820 - 13:38.280:  process we're looking at. So it was her decision not to go after these 20 or so people. That's right,
13:38.280 - 13:43.980:  these were only recommendations from the first special grand jury as it's called. When you dig
13:43.980 - 13:49.040:  down into the detail of this report, what we do see is the voting patterns on these various
13:49.040 - 13:54.080:  individuals and you can see, for example, in the case of certainly some of the senators, one of
13:54.080 - 13:59.680:  the senators, that there was a fair old chunk of people who voted against inditing Lindsey Graham
13:59.680 - 14:04.020:  and you can see if you're the district attorney, you might think, well, that's in a sense a test
14:04.040 - 14:10.360:  run of what might happen in the real circumstances of a trial. So maybe I don't have the evidence to
14:10.360 - 14:14.600:  go ahead with that one. Lindsey Graham, of course, quite a well-known figure. What's he been saying
14:14.600 - 14:19.280:  about this? He's come out today and given a very long sort of press conference and said he's very
14:19.280 - 14:24.340:  worried about this process. He was just doing his job as a senator. That's effectively his defense
14:24.340 - 14:29.680:  and of course we do know that he was one of those people who rang up the Georgia Secretary of State,
14:29.680 - 14:33.680:  exactly the same thing that Donald Trump did if you remember in that famous taped interview
14:33.680 - 14:38.560:  that was released. But Lindsey Graham says, well, I was just asking about mail-in ballots and
14:38.680 - 14:43.060:  whether things were going to be worked properly for the senatorial elections, which there were two
14:43.060 - 14:48.520:  coming up very shortly after the general election. He's not used the explosive language that the
14:48.520 - 14:53.740:  Trump campaigners used, talking about politically motivated investigations, but he has said that
14:53.740 - 14:57.500:  he stands by Donald Trump. He supported him for president. He would support him again.
14:57.940 - 15:03.240:  Gary O'Donohue in Washington. Five years ago, the world was captivated by the rescue of a
15:03.240 - 15:10.200:  young football team stuck in a Thai cave system for 18 days. Now, 150 rescuers from around the
15:10.200 - 15:16.080:  world have converged on one of Turkey's deepest caves to try to bring out an American scientist
15:16.080 - 15:21.040:  trapped a kilometer underground. Mark Dickie was part of an international team exploring the
15:21.040 - 15:26.960:  Walker cave in the Taurus Mountains when he fell ill with gastrointestinal bleeding. He recorded
15:26.960 - 15:32.820:  this message. Mark Dickie from nearly a thousand meters. I want to thank everyone who's down here
15:32.820 - 15:39.320:  and thank the response of the Caving Community. The Caving World is a really tight-knit group and
15:39.320 - 15:44.760:  it is amazing to see how many people have responded on the surface. We're still waiting for communication
15:44.920 - 15:49.360:  to actually reach down here. So right now, it's a day to two days where the travel for information
15:49.360 - 15:55.580:  to get back and forth. As you can see, I'm up on my lured, I'm talking, but I'm not healed
15:55.580 - 15:59.400:  on the inside yet, so I'm going to need a lot of help to get out of here.
16:00.120 - 16:05.080:  Well, Berzer, Shimshek of the BBC Turkish Services following the rescue operation, she told us
16:05.080 - 16:10.840:  the latest on Mark Dickie's state of health. Doctors are currently trying to improve his condition
16:10.840 - 16:18.900:  so that the rescue operation can start. He's stuck down below in 1,040 meter. As far as we understand,
16:18.900 - 16:25.280:  he also said in his video message that he can talk, he can, he's alert, but obviously his
16:25.280 - 16:31.500:  condition needs to improve before the rescue operation can start. He is a kilometer beneath
16:31.500 - 16:36.440:  the surface, but presumably that's not just straight down. I mean, I used to do Caving at university
16:36.480 - 16:42.180:  as amateur, so I'm a bit familiar with the Caves and Caves are divided into two. You have
16:42.180 - 16:48.620:  vertical caves and you have horizontal caves. This is a vertical cave. This is the third deepest cave
16:48.620 - 16:55.080:  in Turkey, and he is stuck down below 1,040 meter, and most of the cave is, I mean, you can imagine,
16:55.080 - 17:00.640:  as if like, climbing to a mountain, but you're doing it underground, you're climbing up and down
17:00.640 - 17:07.140:  with a rope. You need to go through twists and turns in narrow spaces, so basically that's the
17:07.140 - 17:12.300:  situation he's in right now. So how will they be able to get him out and how long could it take?
17:12.320 - 17:18.440:  That's what they're trying to figure out. So as far as I understand, the European Cave Rescue
17:19.160 - 17:25.020:  Association has made out a plan. They have divided the cave into seven sections, and there are different
17:25.020 - 17:31.260:  teams from European countries, and each country will be taking care of one section. For example,
17:31.260 - 17:37.780:  the Bulgarian team will take him from 1,040 meter to 900 meter, and then they will hand over to
17:37.780 - 17:43.660:  another team. That's their plan, but the discussion is whether they can now use a stretcher or not,
17:43.660 - 17:49.460:  because it's a vertical cave, you know, it might be difficult to rescue him with a stretcher,
17:49.460 - 17:55.760:  which means that he needs to be quite strong before the rescue operation can start. It's a very
17:55.760 - 18:00.360:  important story in Turkish press as well, but we will see what's going to happen.
18:00.900 - 18:06.840:  Bursa, Shimshek of the BBC Turkish Service. And still to come on the global news podcast.
18:06.840 - 18:12.820:  Some of the wives of the male astronauts didn't want the women, you know, flying in the jets
18:12.820 - 18:17.820:  with their husbands. Overall, they got through it, and NASA is much better for it.
18:18.180 - 18:22.860:  A new book about the challenges faced by the first generation of female astronauts.
18:23.720 - 18:27.260:  Before that, Andrew Peaches here with news of this week's HappyPod.
18:52.380 - 18:57.860:  If you're a little win, the thing that's made your week, prepare to meet a US Navy lieutenant in
18:57.860 - 19:04.480:  Washington State and a proud dog owner in Western Australia. The HappyPod in this feed every Saturday.
19:10.920 - 19:15.980:  As I mentioned earlier, the G20 club of the world's richest nations is meeting in India,
19:16.600 - 19:21.380:  but two leaders are notable by their absence. Russia's Vladimir Putin and the Chinese
19:21.380 - 19:26.340:  President Xi Jinping. The host of the summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
19:26.340 - 19:31.900:  is still hoping to use the gathering to highlight India's increasingly important role in the world.
19:32.660 - 19:37.680:  And one of the ways he's doing it is by inviting the African Union to join the G20.
19:37.680 - 19:41.820:  Speaking at a news conference in Delhi, the President of the European Council,
19:41.820 - 19:44.960:  Sharmesh El, said he looked forward to welcoming the AU.
19:45.740 - 19:51.240:  For many years, I'm absolutely convinced that we need to make sure that the developing
19:51.240 - 19:56.960:  countries, including in Africa, are more represented on the international stage at the international
19:57.000 - 20:02.800:  level. We want decisions that are implemented. We need more inclusivity at the international level.
20:03.280 - 20:09.340:  Well, for more on the addition of the AU to the G20, and details of how India intends to smooth
20:09.340 - 20:13.860:  over disagreements about the war in Ukraine, I spoke to our South Asia correspondent,
20:13.860 - 20:14.900:  Yogi Telamay.
20:15.300 - 20:21.260:  For India, in its year of presidency, one of the things that they've tried to project themselves
20:21.260 - 20:26.300:  as is the voice of developing countries around the world. And in keeping with that,
20:26.300 - 20:31.920:  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi actually wrote to G20 leaders saying that the African
20:31.920 - 20:37.540:  Union should be included into the G20, a wider range of voices around the world should be included.
20:38.020 - 20:42.880:  There was an op-ed he actually wrote for an Indian newspaper which came out ahead of the summit
20:42.880 - 20:49.800:  yesterday. And he said, people shouldn't just be looking at the GDP growth or economic growth
20:50.400 - 20:55.620:  as a measure for countries. Voices should be heard of all countries around the world. And so I think
20:55.620 - 21:02.520:  that's one of India's big efforts is to portray and showcase its position in the world, but its
21:02.520 - 21:05.720:  position as a voice of developing countries.
21:06.360 - 21:11.440:  Now, interesting that two of the countries in the G20 are not sending their leaders China and
21:11.440 - 21:16.940:  Russia. And the head of the UN says that if we are indeed a global family, we resemble a
21:16.940 - 21:20.880:  rather dysfunctional one. Is the G20 still fit for purpose?
21:21.520 - 21:27.000:  I was actually at the press conference held by the UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutherrish and
21:27.260 - 21:31.160:  was exactly the question that I asked him because he described this as a pivotal summit.
21:31.740 - 21:36.900:  But when you have to really powerful heads of state of those nations not coming,
21:36.900 - 21:40.360:  they are also permanent members of the UN Security Council.
21:40.360 - 21:45.520:  What really can you hope to accomplish? His answer, of course, was that it doesn't matter
21:45.520 - 21:49.180:  who's representing the country. The countries need to understand their responsibility.
21:49.180 - 21:55.820:  What India as the host country particularly wants is that despite the divisions and the deepening
21:55.820 - 22:02.220:  disagreements over the war in Ukraine, that there will be a joint statement from all members
22:02.220 - 22:06.720:  at the end of the summit on Sunday. That wording is going to be extremely complicated
22:06.720 - 22:12.700:  for them to agree on. But I think what India will look at as a success as the host country this
22:12.700 - 22:17.260:  year will be that there's some joint statement that everybody can agree on and is issued.
22:17.260 - 22:24.680:  Yobiter Lamai in Delhi. Ukraine's foreign ministry has condemned a visit by a Chinese singer and
22:24.680 - 22:31.080:  Chinese bloggers to the Russian occupied city of Maripal. Ukraine has been angered by a video that
22:31.080 - 22:36.340:  apparently shows a woman singing a Russian folk song inside the ruins of the Maripal theatre,
22:36.340 - 22:41.240:  destroyed by Russian bombing last year, resulting in the deaths of many people.
22:41.900 - 22:43.660:  With more details, his Danny Eberhardt.
22:46.760 - 22:51.700:  It's a powerful rendition. The woman standing on a balcony sings Khutusha.
22:52.340 - 22:57.560:  It's a Soviet era love song to a man fighting to defend his motherland, which became famous in the
22:57.560 - 23:03.840:  second world war. But the video has incensed Kiev. The destruction of the Maripal theatre in March
23:03.840 - 23:09.460:  last year was one of the worst atrocities of the war. Many people using the building as a shelter
23:09.460 - 23:14.960:  were killed. Some estimates put the figure at 600. A spokesman for Ukraine's foreign ministry
23:14.960 - 23:20.480:  called the performance an example of complete moral degradation. He's called for China to clarify
23:20.480 - 23:27.900:  what he called an illegal visit. Danny Eberhardt. Pakistan says advanced weaponry left behind in
23:27.900 - 23:33.320:  Afghanistan after the US withdrawal is now being used by insurgent groups to launch attacks
23:33.320 - 23:39.160:  across the border. The comments came after hundreds of Pakistani Taliban militants carried out a
23:39.160 - 23:44.540:  cross-border raid on security posts in the remote mountainous district of Chitral earlier this week.
23:45.000 - 23:48.740:  With more details, here's our South Asia regional editor Ann Barsan Etirajan.
23:49.460 - 23:53.860:  The foreign ministry in Islamabad said the issue of advanced weapons in Afghanistan
23:53.860 - 23:59.680:  merited international attention. It's estimated that billions of dollars' worth of modern weapons
23:59.680 - 24:06.040:  were abandoned when the US forces withdrew in August 2021. Pakistan says some of the
24:06.040 - 24:11.700:  equipment have now fallen into the hands of insurgent groups like the Tehreket Taliban or the
24:11.700 - 24:16.540:  Pakistani Taliban. The clashes with the group earlier this week led to the death of four
24:16.540 - 24:22.880:  Pakistani soldiers and 12 insurgents. The Pentagon has denied US troops had left any of their
24:22.880 - 24:28.480:  weapons behind when they left Afghanistan. It has blamed the Afghan military for abandoning
24:28.480 - 24:34.520:  that American weapons when the Taliban took over. Islamabad says Pakistani Taliban militants have
24:34.520 - 24:40.660:  set up bases across the border in Afghanistan but Kabul denies the charges. The Pakistani Taliban
24:40.660 - 24:46.400:  group has stepped up attacks on security forces after it called off a ceasefire late last year.
24:46.840 - 24:48.300:  Ann Barsan Etirajan
24:49.080 - 24:53.680:  Before the end of this decade, an American astronaut could become the first woman to set foot
24:53.680 - 24:59.480:  on the moon, more than 50 years after Neil Armstrong. It will be one giant leap for
24:59.480 - 25:06.400:  woman kind in a journey that began back in 1978 when NASA reversed its previously male-only
25:06.400 - 25:12.900:  recruitment process to select six elite women to become astronauts. One of the six Sally Rhyde
25:12.900 - 25:17.480:  became the first American woman in space. Here she is talking about her training program.
25:18.140 - 25:23.000:  I really don't think that there is any aspect of the training or of the flight where it's made
25:23.000 - 25:27.240:  any difference that there have been women astronauts on the crew or not. The women and the men
25:27.240 - 25:32.340:  go through exactly the same training. The women and the men do exactly the same jobs on orbit
25:32.520 - 25:36.940:  and weightlessness is a great equalizer. You don't need to be strong to do things up there.
25:36.940 - 25:42.240:  There is really no difference. Lauren Grasch, space reporter for Bloomberg News, tells the story
25:42.240 - 25:48.140:  of these pioneering women in her new book The Six. She told Julian Marshall about their rigorous
25:48.140 - 25:53.360:  survival training and how they had to fight the misogyny of their age. Thankfully the country
25:53.360 - 25:58.700:  had changed during the time between the Apollo program and when the first six women came on board,
25:58.700 - 26:02.700:  you know, we had the Civil Rights movement and the feminist movement. And NASA was getting a lot
26:02.700 - 26:09.140:  of questions about why they had not included women in people of color before. And so it was really
26:09.140 - 26:15.460:  top of mind for them when they opened up the astronaut corps to a more diverse class of individuals.
26:15.580 - 26:21.400:  You know, not everybody was on board within NASA. You know, a few men who just weren't used to working
26:21.400 - 26:26.180:  with women in a professional capacity like this. There was some friction. Few of them not taking
26:26.180 - 26:32.120:  them women seriously. Never also some women who weren't very happy with the women being in the
26:32.120 - 26:37.300:  astronaut corps. Some of the wives of the male astronauts didn't want the women, you know,
26:37.300 - 26:43.400:  flying in the jets with their husbands. That, but overall they got through it and NASA is much
26:43.400 - 26:49.880:  better for it. And once selected these six women then underwent the same rigorous training as
26:49.880 - 26:55.780:  the men. Yes, one of the probably more fun aspects of training was they had to stay current in
26:55.780 - 27:02.100:  NASA's fleet of T-38 jets. Some of the women were pilots when they came onto the program, but
27:02.420 - 27:06.520:  they only got to fly in the backseat and they weren't allowed to take off and land though I've
27:06.520 - 27:10.900:  spoken to a few of their former colleagues who said that they did maybe let them take off and land
27:10.940 - 27:16.780:  when they were in the backseat. Did NASA though have to adapt to accommodate women in space and
27:16.780 - 27:21.860:  I literally mean accommodate? Yeah, of course. That included things like adding a women's bathroom
27:21.900 - 27:26.460:  at the locker room. Also, some of the equipment that they had on board for the shuttle, obviously
27:26.460 - 27:31.220:  the way that men went to the restroom in space during the Apollo program wasn't going to cut it.
27:31.540 - 27:35.540:  And NASA had absolutely no idea of the number of tampons they had to provide.
27:35.540 - 27:40.620:  Unfortunately, that was something that the male engineers at NASA had to learn the hard way.
27:40.700 - 27:45.480:  So there's a really great moment where Sally Ride was performing her bench checks ahead of her
27:45.480 - 27:50.260:  flight where you look over all of the equipment that you have to bring on board and included in
27:50.260 - 27:55.440:  that toiletric kit. She saw a pink plastic and she had Kathy Sullivan with her at the time to help
27:55.440 - 27:59.480:  her out with this. And they grabbed the pink plastic and pulled on it and out came another
27:59.480 - 28:04.600:  pink plastic tube and another pink plastic tube. Came together like sausages and the engineers
28:04.600 - 28:10.460:  asked Sally of 100 tampons would be enough for her week-long trip in space. And she
28:10.720 - 28:13.500:  politely told them you could cut that in half and you would be fine.
28:14.680 - 28:19.280:  You've spoken about the intense media scrutiny of the women while they were training,
28:19.280 - 28:24.880:  but did that change to a claim when they started to undertake their duties?
28:25.500 - 28:31.260:  It was a mixture of both obviously some criticism but a lot of fanfare. It was still very
28:31.300 - 28:35.620:  burdensome because everybody wanted to talk to her, everybody wanted to celebrate her.
28:35.760 - 28:41.720:  And so she really went through it when she came back to Earth. It was something that really
28:42.200 - 28:46.360:  weighed heavy on her. You know, she wound up seeking therapy over it just because of how
28:46.360 - 28:53.400:  intense that media blitz became. But yes, ultimately, I think everyone was so enamored with her.
28:53.580 - 28:55.560:  That's why it was so chaotic.
28:56.200 - 29:00.580:  Lauren Grush, space reporter for Bloomberg News, telling the story of NASA's first female
29:00.580 - 29:07.480:  astronauts in her new book The Six. The Mercury Music Prize celebrates the best British or Irish
29:07.480 - 29:13.420:  album of the year. This year, the Ezra Collective became the first jazz act to win.
29:13.420 - 29:18.240:  The band, who met at a club for at-risk youth, recorded their winning album,
29:18.240 - 29:23.820:  where I meant to be during the pandemic. They saw a competition from the Arctic monkeys and Jesse
29:24.720 - 29:28.060:  where. Here's drummer Fermi Koli also accepting the prize.
29:48.440 - 29:52.940:  Well, the jazz musician Jamie Colum is one of the Mercury Prize judges. What does he make of the
29:59.260 - 30:04.080:  Ezra Collective? It is a very, very tricky thing to be one of the judges on the Mercury Prize.
30:05.420 - 30:10.520:  It's curating this incredible list of great current British and Irish music. However,
30:10.520 - 30:16.420:  on the night we crown a winner and I think Ezra Collective's album was a brilliant album,
30:17.040 - 30:21.920:  which is the most important thing. It represents a big leap forward for the band to be in around
30:21.920 - 30:25.900:  now for a while. But actually, I think this year it's a really exciting moment to spot like
30:26.060 - 30:30.840:  what's been happening in British jazz over the last 10 years or so. British jazz has always been
30:31.180 - 30:34.040:  exciting, just sometimes it takes a while for the press to catch up.
30:41.480 - 30:47.240:  The music itself has bringing together all these elements that make the country what it is
30:47.580 - 30:51.540:  and bringing it into this joyous sounding music. So all the sounds that make this country tick
30:52.780 - 30:57.940:  coming forth within their music and it is the sound of a joyous opportunity for a beautiful future
30:58.160 - 31:02.760:  and the band really represent that and that for me is why they want. In order to achieve the
31:02.760 - 31:09.340:  levels of virtuosity that they have as musicians, the sheer amount of hours that you need to spend
31:09.340 - 31:14.400:  to be that good at your instrument, that good at improvising, the ability to play with that
31:14.400 - 31:20.320:  much freedom. The graft is quite unimaginable actually and I think that you develop a lot of
31:20.320 - 31:24.260:  humility but particularly in that world of jazz where really you come to the table and all the
31:24.260 - 31:29.560:  matters is whether you can play, you don't start playing jazz music to win a prize like the
31:29.560 - 31:34.200:  Mercury Prize or to be on television or to be doing interviews. It is something you do because
31:34.200 - 31:38.920:  it's inside you and you enjoy the struggle, you enjoy that journey of trying to improve your
31:38.920 - 31:42.180:  musicianship and the freedom that you then get with playing with other musicians.
31:59.400 - 32:04.200:  And that was Jamie Cullum talking about the Ezra Collective, the first jazz band ever to win the
32:04.200 - 32:10.440:  prestigious Mercury Music Prize. Now, just before we go, a quick thanks to the listeners who spotted
32:10.440 - 32:17.000:  our error at the start of yesterday's podcast. Yes, we do realise it is September this month.
32:17.000 - 32:22.180:  And not as I said, November, thanks to Pradeep and Mickey and Hector for pointing it out.
32:22.180 - 32:27.360:  I'd like to say it was a deliberate error but it was simply a slip of the keyboard.
32:27.360 - 32:32.920:  Finally thanks to Julie Smith Allen who thought it might have been my way of checking if you were
32:32.920 - 32:37.420:  all listening. Well, Julie, it wasn't but it's very good to know you are.
32:40.280 - 32:44.700:  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast very soon.
