00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:12.700:  by Advertising.
00:16.020 - 00:20.020:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
00:20.160 - 00:25.920:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
00:25.920 - 00:30.340:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
00:30.480 - 00:35.260:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad gal as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos
00:35.260 - 00:39.600:  really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars,
00:39.600 - 00:45.020:  listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me Simon Jack, and me Zingsing, available now wherever you
00:45.020 - 00:52.100:  get your podcasts. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:55.020 - 00:58.860:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway, this edition is published in the early hours of Thursday the 7th
00:58.860 - 01:04.280:  of September. Scientists in Israel have grown an almost exact replica of a human embryo without
01:04.280 - 01:10.940:  using sperm or an egg. The US has promised more military aid for Ukraine on the day 17 people were
01:10.940 - 01:24.740:  killed in a Russian missile attack on a marketplace. And later, the Rolling Stones are back with a new
01:24.740 - 01:33.900:  album. Also in the podcast, a nationwide manhunt is under way in Britain as a terrorism suspect makes
01:33.900 - 01:39.720:  a rare escape from prison. And four Roman swords believed to have been captured by Jewish rebels
01:39.720 - 01:50.660:  are discovered in a remote cave in Israel. Now, what constitutes life? Well, scientists have
01:50.660 - 01:57.660:  managed to create a near exact replica of a 14-day old human embryo without using sperm, an egg,
01:57.660 - 02:03.900:  or a womb. The so-called model embryo contained all the cell types needed to develop and grow.
02:04.620 - 02:09.520:  The scientists from the Weitzmann Institute in Israel say their research aims to shed light on
02:09.520 - 02:15.300:  the mysterious but crucial early days after conception. It could lead to new breakthroughs in
02:15.300 - 02:21.000:  preventing early miscarriage and in the development of new technologies for growing organs for transplant.
02:21.720 - 02:25.220:  Lead scientist Professor Jacob Hanna explains how it could help.
02:26.020 - 02:31.260:  We want to make cells for transplantation and we want to be the cells identical to the patient
02:31.260 - 02:36.860:  who receives them. One of the dreams of this technology is say there is a person who is really
02:36.860 - 02:42.140:  about to die because he or she cannot find a bone marrow transplant to take a skin biopsy,
02:42.880 - 02:48.720:  mix themselves, and then differentiate them into this embryo-like model, let's say, for 40 days.
02:49.080 - 02:53.420:  And then we can transplant it back to the patient without looking for donor, without having the
02:53.420 - 02:58.760:  risk of rejection because these cells cannot be rejected. Professor Jacob Hanna of the Weitzmann
02:58.760 - 03:05.160:  Institute. So how exciting a moment is this for science? Our health and science correspondent is
03:05.160 - 03:09.540:  James Gallagher. I think really quite exciting Oliver. We've had a lot of research, a lot of
03:09.620 - 03:14.120:  progress in terms of trying to do this in the laboratory but this is the first time that
03:14.120 - 03:18.060:  team of scientists actually been able to get to the point where they can say this version of an
03:18.060 - 03:24.760:  embryo we have grown in a laboratory looks pretty much the same as one that would develop naturally
03:25.180 - 03:29.440:  and reaching that level has caused quite a lot of excitement amongst other scientists and
03:29.440 - 03:35.800:  researchers today. So pretty much the same, are there differences or could this grow into a human?
03:36.480 - 03:40.240:  No, and there are many reasons for that. One of them is simply that it's illegal and you would
03:40.240 - 03:43.560:  never be allowed to do this pretty much anywhere in the world that has laws around this area,
03:43.560 - 03:47.980:  would not let you do this. There are some scientific reasons why we don't think it would work.
03:48.460 - 03:53.560:  So the way that it is designed, you actually end up missing some of the earliest days of embryo
03:53.560 - 03:58.740:  development and by the time that it starts to look like something embryo-like, it's probably
03:58.740 - 04:02.460:  missed the opportunity that you could put it into a womb and it would actually embed itself
04:02.460 - 04:06.940:  into the walls of the womb and actually form a pregnancy. So scientifically there are big
04:06.940 - 04:12.980:  questions there as well. But they have created this amazing replica. How did they do it?
04:13.420 - 04:19.820:  So traditionally, one sperm meets one egg, they fuse and an embryo emerges and there are no
04:19.820 - 04:24.500:  sperm or eggs or wombs involved in any of this. So they use something called stem cells and those
04:24.500 - 04:28.800:  are the ones that have the capacity to become any type of tissue in the human body and they
04:28.800 - 04:34.460:  coax those using like subtle chemicals into the four types of cell you would find in a week
04:34.460 - 04:39.820:  old embryo. And then you mix around about 120 of those together in the laboratory and it just looks
04:39.820 - 04:46.300:  like a jumbled up mess to start off with but as they grow over a period of eight days, they start
04:46.300 - 04:51.160:  to organize themselves with no input from scientists. They're doing it all themselves into something
04:51.160 - 04:57.340:  that actually resembles a 14 day old human embryo and that's the first time that's ever happened.
04:57.500 - 05:04.820:  Now in many countries, 14 days is the legal cutoff embryonic research? Could they get round
05:04.820 - 05:10.680:  that and grow these models into older replicas? You're onto a really interesting good point here
05:10.680 - 05:16.920:  because the legal limit for human embryo research is 14 days in many countries. These aren't
05:16.920 - 05:20.800:  human embryos. There's a legal entity there known as an embryo model so they don't have to
05:20.800 - 05:26.240:  abide by those same rules. So technically, if scientists decided they wanted to, they could
05:26.240 - 05:33.440:  attempt to go beyond the 14 day rule and see later stages of embryo development. Some people
05:33.920 - 05:38.900:  would welcome that as a way of studying that period of our development. Others would be horrified
05:38.900 - 05:44.360:  and I think we're very much in a point where the science has leapt well ahead of where regulation
05:44.360 - 05:48.960:  is anywhere in the world for actually deciding what is right, what's our ethically acceptable,
05:48.960 - 05:55.020:  what's legally acceptable because the closer scientists come to replicating an embryo in a dish,
05:55.160 - 05:59.380:  it will lead many people to ask well shouldn't they be treated in the same way as an embryo? It is a
05:59.380 - 06:05.020:  very live ethical debate right now. A health and science correspondent James Galer.
06:06.240 - 06:12.540:  This Russian evil must be defeated as soon as possible. The words of the Ukrainian president as
06:12.540 - 06:17.660:  he condemned a Russian attack on a market in eastern Ukraine. The missile strike in the
06:17.660 - 06:30.040:  Donetsk region killed at least 17 people. Ukraine said 32 others were injured while cars and small
06:30.040 - 06:35.020:  shops were destroyed. The strike came as the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visited
06:35.020 - 06:40.100:  Kiev to offer more assistance and to give an upbeat assessment of progress in Ukraine's
06:40.100 - 06:45.220:  counteroffensive against the Russian invaders. In the years since I was last year, Ukraine has taken
06:45.220 - 06:51.460:  back more than 50 percent of the territory that Russia ceased from it since February of 2022.
06:51.500 - 06:56.920:  In the current counteroffensive, we are seeing real progress over the last few weeks.
06:57.520 - 07:01.100:  President Solensky just returned from the front line so I was able to hear directly from him
07:01.520 - 07:07.080:  his assessment of the counteroffensive and I think it very much matches our own. We are doing
07:07.080 - 07:10.920:  everything we can to maximize our support to Ukraine as it pursues the counteroffensive.
07:11.480 - 07:16.760:  The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken in Ukraine, well I heard more about Wednesdays attacks in
07:16.760 - 07:21.940:  the east of the country from our correspondent in Kiev, Paul Adams. This was about two o'clock in
07:21.940 - 07:29.880:  the afternoon on a market street in a small town in eastern Ukraine called Kostya Antonevka,
07:29.880 - 07:35.120:  not far from Bachmuth which obviously listeners will be familiar with. It's a place that's been
07:35.120 - 07:41.420:  the target of attacks in the past but never I think on this scale. We don't know exactly what
07:41.420 - 07:47.720:  it was that caused the explosion but there was a huge flash of orange fire, an enormous explosion,
07:47.900 - 07:54.560:  shrapnel was sent in many directions and the scenes afterwards were really pretty horrendous with
07:54.900 - 08:01.560:  building set on fire, cars mangled and a great many terribly injured bodies lying in the street.
08:01.760 - 08:08.280:  So a very graphic and disturbing attack which the Ukrainians obviously were very quick to blame
08:08.280 - 08:14.900:  on Russia. Now at the same time as it was feeling the effects of the war, it has had something of
08:14.900 - 08:21.360:  a boost from that visit by Anthony Blinken. Will Ukrainians be encouraged by the fact that he says
08:22.020 - 08:27.440:  there has been important progress in its counteroffensive? I think he perhaps was anxious to sound
08:27.440 - 08:34.260:  positive because this comes off the back of a period when a number of generally unnamed American
08:34.260 - 08:39.360:  officials have been quoted in American newspapers suggesting that they were not happy with the progress
08:39.360 - 08:43.740:  of the counteroffensive and that Ukraine wasn't perhaps fighting the way they expected or wanted
08:43.740 - 08:48.220:  them to fight but of course the other thing that he did and Mr Blinken was he brought yet another
08:48.220 - 08:53.300:  package of military assistance. This one includes the kind of full range that you would expect from
08:53.680 - 08:58.560:  Ukraine's air defenses which are getting better all the time through two vast quantities of ammunition,
08:58.560 - 09:04.720:  missiles, shells for tanks, a lot more of the kind of thing that the Ukrainians have been receiving
09:04.720 - 09:10.740:  all year. But despite that extra assistance, President Zelensky speaking of a ash winter ahead.
09:11.580 - 09:16.840:  I think people are already beginning to think ahead to what this could be like. There will be
09:17.240 - 09:22.040:  vivid memories of last winter. It was actually a remarkably mild winter which was very much to
09:22.040 - 09:26.960:  Ukraine's advantage but it was one in which we saw the Russians of course mounting that sustained
09:26.960 - 09:32.500:  attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. I think there's a feeling that Ukraine could be in for
09:32.500 - 09:38.720:  more of that. I think there's an acknowledgement that Ukraine's counteroffensive may not achieve
09:38.720 - 09:45.240:  quite as much by the end of the year as everyone had hoped that it may be that Ukraine has to wait
09:45.240 - 09:50.300:  until next year for something more decisive and in the meantime there could be very difficult days
09:50.300 - 09:56.660:  ahead while at the same time feeling relatively confident and encouraged by the recent signs of
09:56.660 - 10:01.580:  progress in the South. Paul Adams, our correspondent in the Ukrainian capital Kiev.
10:02.660 - 10:07.680:  At the end of a three-day climate summit in Kenya, African leaders have called for new global
10:07.680 - 10:13.600:  taxes to fund action against global warming. The heads of states say the Nairobi declaration will
10:13.600 - 10:19.780:  form the basis of their negotiating position at the Worldwide COP28 summit in Dubai later this year.
10:20.300 - 10:25.240:  The Kenyan presidents William Ruto said Africa had to be given the support it needed to cope with
10:25.240 - 10:31.580:  the challenges and harness the opportunities presented by climate change. We demand a fair
10:31.580 - 10:37.220:  playing ground for our countries to access the investment needed to unlock the potential and
10:37.220 - 10:44.540:  translate it into opportunities. Adjust multilateral development finance architecture to liberate
10:44.920 - 10:52.040:  our economies from odious debt and onerous barriers to necessary financial resources.
10:52.060 - 10:58.220:  We are clear in our minds that the international community must work with us in this journey
10:58.220 - 11:05.180:  into a future of prosperity and security in an ecologically balanced driving planet.
11:05.940 - 11:09.680:  William Ruto, our African regional editor Richard Hamilton has more details.
11:10.360 - 11:16.600:  The declaration includes proposed taxes on shipping, aviation and the trade in fossil fuel,
11:16.600 - 11:23.440:  as well as a global financial transaction tax. African countries have suffered from heavy debt
11:23.440 - 11:28.800:  burdens for years and say they're forced to pay borrowing costs that are five to eight times
11:28.800 - 11:34.320:  higher than those imposed on wealthy nations. However, while some countries in the world have
11:34.320 - 11:41.020:  imposed their own carbon taxes, the idea of a global tax regime has not gained much traction.
11:42.000 - 11:47.000:  Researchers say that despite suffering from some of the worst impacts of climate change,
11:47.460 - 11:53.580:  Africa only receives about 12 percent of the financing it needs to combat it.
11:54.080 - 11:58.740:  Richard Hamilton. The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka has called for an international
11:58.740 - 12:04.700:  investigation into the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. After a documentary claim they were
12:04.700 - 12:10.500:  orchestrated to influence the country's presidential election. Islamists targeted three churches
12:10.500 - 12:16.860:  and high-end hotels, killing more than 270 people. Here's our South Asia regional editor
12:16.860 - 12:22.540:  Anbarasan Etirajan. The investigative report by the British Channel 4 network featured a Sri
12:22.540 - 12:28.660:  Lankan political insider who accused the current state intelligence chief Suresh Sally of complicity
12:28.660 - 12:34.220:  in the attacks. The whistleblower left Sri Lanka last year and has now sought asylum in Europe.
12:34.620 - 12:40.000:  Mr. Sally has denied the accusation and says he was not in the country at the time of the bombings.
12:40.340 - 12:45.820:  He is closely linked to the powerful Rajapaksha clan, two members of which have served as president
12:45.820 - 12:51.320:  of the country. After the documentary was aired, the current Sri Lankan government said it would
12:51.320 - 12:57.000:  appoint a parliamentary committee to look into the latest allegations. Initial investigations
12:57.000 - 13:02.540:  showed that local jihadists, inspired by the Islamic State militant group, carried out the
13:03.420 - 13:09.700:  attacks, Gota Bayarajapaksha became president in the elections held in late 2019 after promising
13:09.700 - 13:16.400:  to restore security. He was forced to leave office last year following protests over an unprecedented
13:16.400 - 13:23.380:  economic crisis. Anbarasan Etirajan. Now, rock and roll's great survivors were back center
13:32.120 - 13:37.240:  stage in East London on Wednesday. The rolling stones with angry from their first album of
13:37.240 - 13:43.380:  original material in 18 years entitled Hackney Diamonds, it will be released next month.
13:53.500 - 13:58.960:  We all said we've got to make a record that we really love ourselves. Other people may like it,
13:58.960 - 14:04.160:  other people may not, but we must say that we are quite pleased with it. I'm not saying we've
14:04.220 - 14:07.100:  been getting it about it, but we're pleased with it. We hope you all like it.
14:07.560 - 14:13.480:  80-year-old lead singer Mick Jagger. Well, the release of the album comes two years after the death
14:13.480 - 14:19.820:  of drummer Charlie Watts. He was replaced by Steve Jordan and guitarist Keith Richards spoke about
14:19.820 - 14:24.920:  what that meant. Ever since Charlie's gone, it's different. He's number four. He's missing. He's
14:24.920 - 14:32.060:  up there. Thanks to Charlie Watts. Also, we have Steve Jordan, who was Charlie's recommendation for
14:32.260 - 14:37.160:  if anything should happen to him. Steve Jordan's a man. It would have been a lot harder without
14:37.180 - 14:43.700:  Charlie's blessing. Well, our music correspondent Mark Savage was at the album's launch. I mean,
14:43.700 - 14:49.100:  they were playing concerts festival-sized concerts just last summer, and then they went straight into
14:49.100 - 14:53.320:  the studio, made this album in the space of a month, December last year, and here they are,
14:53.320 - 14:58.900:  releasing it. They're 24th album, 61 years into their career. Now, Charlie Watts played on two
14:58.900 - 15:04.320:  of the tracks before his death, and they also brought back former member Bill Wyman, going back to
15:04.320 - 15:09.800:  the start almost. Yeah, pretty much it's 30 years since Bill Wyman played with the band, and he's
15:09.800 - 15:14.680:  there on a song that also features Charlie Watts, called Live by the Sword. So they said, at the press
15:14.680 - 15:20.320:  conference today, it's their original rhythm section back together again. Now, Lady Gaga is going
15:20.320 - 15:25.760:  to appear on the album. I guess following that trend of bringing in modern stars to keeping the
15:25.760 - 15:32.040:  sound alive? Yeah, I mean, it's not like I think Lady Gaga is going to come in and do a guest
15:32.040 - 15:37.040:  verse. It's not going to be the Rolling Stones featuring Lady Gaga. She has that kind of rock voice.
15:37.040 - 15:42.540:  She can really belt. So I suspect she'll be holding her own, like in a kind of tango with Mick Jagger.
15:42.980 - 15:46.480:  And we've also heard a couple of other guests on there. Paul McCartney is going to play bass
15:46.480 - 15:51.540:  on one of the songs. Stevie Wonder is playing Hammond organ on the same song that Lady Gaga is on,
15:51.540 - 15:56.840:  and Elton Johns on the record as well. So it's an all-star cast for this reunion of the Rolling Stones.
15:57.120 - 16:01.460:  Now, we all know about when we go to concerts and bands play their old stuff, and then they
16:01.460 - 16:06.240:  wheel out some newer tracks, and it's never quite as good. Can the Rolling Stones do it? Have other
16:06.240 - 16:11.940:  bands managed to keep relevant? Some people do, don't they? And if you think Johnny Cash,
16:11.940 - 16:17.220:  his last recordings before he died, they were an incredible revelation and an exploration
16:17.340 - 16:22.960:  of his older voice and that kind of rugged wisdom. David Bowie's final albums when he was,
16:22.960 - 16:28.020:  you know, staring down death after contracting cancer, they were classic albums. Can the Stones
16:28.020 - 16:33.140:  do that? That's what's up for debate here. The first song that they put out today, angry is a real
16:33.140 - 16:39.840:  kind of barnstorming radio hit. You can hear it on the air, but they haven't really had a great
16:39.840 - 16:44.660:  album since some girls in 1981, so the jury's out until we hear it next month.
16:45.120 - 16:46.820:  Our music correspondent, Muck Savage.
16:49.780 - 16:51.900:  Still to come on the Global News Podcast.
16:59.500 - 17:04.280:  As big budget video games make a comeback post COVID, is this the latest hit?
17:12.340 - 17:16.920:  The World Cup winning footballer, Jenny Armoso, has filed a legal complaint against the head
17:16.920 - 17:23.020:  of Spanish football over his kiss at the final. Miss Armoso alleges that Louis Rubiales' kiss on
17:23.020 - 17:29.660:  her lips was unsolicited, something he contests. I spoke to our correspondent in Madrid, Guy Hedgecoe.
17:29.960 - 17:35.720:  Last week, prosecutors in Spain said that they were opening a preliminary investigation to decide
17:35.720 - 17:40.080:  whether there was enough evidence to bring a case against Louis Rubiales for sexual assault for
17:40.080 - 17:46.340:  that kiss that he gave Jenny Armoso. As part of that investigation, they invited Jenny Armoso
17:46.440 - 17:51.220:  to make her own accusations and to make a statement against Mr Rubiales, because without
17:51.220 - 17:56.860:  the alleged victims' statement, they felt the case wouldn't go much further. Now she has done
17:56.880 - 18:02.800:  that before the prosecutor, the national court can proceed with this case and can investigate
18:02.800 - 18:07.600:  with it further. I think it's significant in a sense that it means that that investigation that
18:07.600 - 18:12.180:  was announced a few days ago, which was sort of probing to see whether things could go any further,
18:12.720 - 18:18.860:  that now is going to proceed. So this is a formalisation of that process and it looks as if
18:19.140 - 18:25.020:  a legal investigation into Mr Rubiales for sexual assault is going to take place. So it really
18:25.020 - 18:31.200:  confirms that and of course, the ramifications of that potentially could be very serious for Mr
18:31.200 - 18:36.840:  Rubiales if it does go to trial. What could he face? He could face charges of sexual assault,
18:36.840 - 18:43.320:  which according to Spanish law could in theory lead to a jail sentence. Now that's looking
18:43.320 - 18:47.660:  ahead a bit and it could be some time before it comes to that, but of course that just adds
18:47.660 - 18:53.700:  to the pressure on Mr Rubiales, which is already pretty intense and has been for a couple of weeks now.
18:53.820 - 18:58.900:  It seems extraordinary that he is still clinging on to his job even though the coach of the
18:58.900 - 19:04.660:  women's World Cup team Jorge Vilda has now been sacked. The federation took that decision in
19:04.660 - 19:10.700:  the absence of Mr Rubiales, who of course has been suspended provisionally by FIFA football's
19:10.700 - 19:16.920:  world governing body. When the Rubiales affair or blew up and Vilda was seen clapping Mr Rubiales
19:16.920 - 19:21.040:  when he made a very defiant speech before the federation, there was a feeling that it was going
19:21.040 - 19:26.280:  to be very difficult for Jorge Vilda to remain in his post because he was seen as such a close
19:26.360 - 19:32.560:  ally of Mr Rubiales and yet someone who really didn't have a lot of support within the football team
19:32.560 - 19:39.220:  itself. Guy Hedgeko in Madrid. A man hunt is underway here in Britain after a former soldier
19:39.220 - 19:45.200:  charged with terror offences escaped from a prison in southwest London. Daniel Abed Calif broke out
19:45.200 - 19:50.740:  of one's worth jail where he was awaiting trial on accusations. He left fake bombs at a military
19:50.860 - 19:56.600:  base. Security checks have been stepped up at ports and airports. Our correspondent Dominic
19:56.600 - 20:02.000:  Cassiani has the details. Daniel Calif was due to stand trial in November, accused of the alleged
20:02.000 - 20:06.380:  bomb hoax and eliciting information that could be used for preparing an act of terrorism.
20:06.920 - 20:11.380:  He's also accused of breaching the official secrets act by gathering information that could
20:11.380 - 20:16.400:  be useful to an enemy. As his last court appearance in July, he denied all the charges.
20:16.900 - 20:22.260:  Disguised as a chef and clinging on to the underside of a van, he evaded multiple opportunities
20:22.260 - 20:27.480:  to detect his escape from the category B prison, the second highest level of security.
20:28.140 - 20:33.080:  Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counterterrorism Command, said he was confident that
20:33.080 - 20:38.080:  Calif posed a low risk to the public but shouldn't be approached. He could be anywhere in the
20:38.080 - 20:41.380:  country at the moment and yes of course we're mindful of the risk of them potentially leaving
20:41.380 - 20:45.800:  the country. We're focusing our efforts in London so we have counterterrorism officers now
20:45.800 - 20:49.920:  deployed across London, working with colleagues from across the metropolitan police and our partner
20:49.920 - 20:54.420:  agencies to try and find him here. We are also working with colleagues all around the country.
20:54.660 - 20:59.540:  The escape immediately triggered a full lockdown of HMP once were found a nationwide alert to
20:59.540 - 21:04.240:  the border force, leading to delays for passengers at Heathrow and Manchester airports.
21:04.840 - 21:10.980:  Even if the 21-year-old is found, the incident is incredibly embarrassing. Escapes are very rare.
21:10.980 - 21:17.580:  They have only been five since 2017 and Calif is the first terror detainee to evade security
21:17.580 - 21:25.340:  since a mass IRA breakout in 1994. Dominic Cassiani reporting. Hollywood has had a close
21:25.340 - 21:30.560:  relationship with the Pentagon for decades. Some films are even given access to real weapons,
21:30.560 - 21:37.300:  fighter jets and ships. But now a congressman wants the law change to prohibit the Pentagon from
21:37.300 - 21:42.760:  helping Hollywood studios which edit content to avoid antagonising the Chinese government.
21:42.780 - 21:49.080:  It follows controversies over the Taiwanese flag in top gun and a map of the South China Sea in
21:49.080 - 21:55.180:  Barbie. Martha Cassiani spoke to Catch Larsen, a military technical advisor who served for 13 years
21:55.180 - 22:03.200:  in the US Navy Seals. There is a long history of cooperation between the Pentagon or the Department
22:03.200 - 22:08.620:  of Defence and Hollywood dating back to World War II, but a collaborate together to make cinema
22:09.080 - 22:13.560:  in order to inform the American public of things that were happening around the war.
22:13.860 - 22:19.580:  That productive relationship continues to this day and I've had the privilege to be part of
22:19.580 - 22:26.760:  many projects as a producer, actor, as a stuntman with the Department of Defence to tell accurate
22:26.760 - 22:31.220:  and authentic military stories. You've known stuff appearing in top gun maverick, didn't you?
22:31.540 - 22:37.760:  I have to say, for myself, my life came full circle. At 17 years old I went to the US Naval
22:37.760 - 22:43.520:  Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, largely inspired by watching the original top gun and then a couple
22:43.520 - 22:49.100:  of years ago I had the opportunity along with several of my other friends who became naval aviators
22:49.100 - 22:54.640:  who were also in the movie because they used real life naval aviators. We were all able to appear
22:54.640 - 22:59.660:  in top gun maverick. But interesting in that top gun maverick is one of the films they've always
22:59.660 - 23:04.860:  often talked about in the current controversy, isn't it? Because the patches on Tom Cruise's
23:04.860 - 23:11.120:  jacket which originally had flags representing Taiwan and Japan appeared to have been swapped out
23:11.120 - 23:16.060:  and replaced by ambiguous symbols. I'm so glad you brought it up because I think it's really an
23:16.060 - 23:21.200:  example of this debate that we're having within the national security community. There are some
23:21.200 - 23:27.760:  people who believe that that kind of censorship represents capitulating to China and I've taken
23:27.760 - 23:35.180:  the position that if we don't allow some compromise and American movies, especially ones that are
23:35.180 - 23:41.460:  intergrary related to USDOD and US military activities are completely banned from China. That will
23:41.460 - 23:47.880:  not serve our strategic goals. What you saw in top gun maverick was you saw an adjustment to
23:47.880 - 23:54.100:  a piece Chinese censorship or Chinese pressure. But the overall impact was that you got to see
23:54.480 - 24:00.700:  an American film about the world's most powerful military in Chinese theaters. So for me that kind
24:00.700 - 24:05.840:  of compromise is worth it. Mark Green, the politician who's pushing for this change has said it's
24:06.120 - 24:11.820:  censorship of American culture to edit these films for Chinese audience. I have absolute respect
24:11.820 - 24:17.780:  for representative green and for the mission that he's trying to accomplish. We both have concerns
24:17.780 - 24:25.880:  about Chinese censorship of American culture. That being said, what the green amendment does that
24:25.880 - 24:32.440:  he's proposed is severely restricts American influence within China. And frankly, it's doubling
24:32.440 - 24:38.860:  up the Pentagon and the Department of Defense already has rules that limit Chinese censorship
24:38.860 - 24:44.820:  for American movies. So this current bill from my perspective is redundant and doesn't give the
24:44.820 - 24:50.200:  freedom and flexibility to what's actually a really important tool in the information battle space
24:50.200 - 24:58.000:  for the Pentagon to use. The truth is there's no substitute for real life cooperation between Hollywood
24:58.000 - 25:03.320:  and the Department of Defense. The more accurate and the more authentic we can make portrayals
25:03.520 - 25:08.000:  of the US military, the more powerful the medium of filmmaking will be.
25:08.800 - 25:12.340:  Catch, Larsson, a military technical advisor talking to Martha Kai.
25:13.220 - 25:18.680:  Archaeologists in Israel have discovered four ancient Roman swords in a cave in the desert.
25:19.320 - 25:23.100:  They think the weapons were captured by Jewish rebels nearly 2,000 years ago.
25:23.580 - 25:25.500:  Here's our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher.
25:25.780 - 25:30.360:  The swords were found in a remote cave overlooking the Dead Sea. At the entrance,
25:30.360 - 25:35.660:  a coin was also found from the time of a famous revolt by Jewish fighters against Roman rule
25:35.660 - 25:39.880:  in what was then Judea. That's led the archaeologists who made the discovery
25:39.880 - 25:45.980:  to herald it as a rare find that casts new light on the era. They believe that the ancient swords
25:45.980 - 25:52.600:  may have been taken as booty from Roman soldiers on or off the battlefield. The Bar Kokba revolt
25:52.600 - 25:58.960:  saw Jewish fighters take control of much of Judea for several years until the Roman Emperor Hadrian
25:59.300 - 26:04.460:  brought the full force of the imperial army down on the rebels crushing them decisively.
26:04.940 - 26:11.100:  Sebastian Usher. As with many sectors, the development of video games was hobbled by the Covid pandemic,
26:11.100 - 26:17.080:  but the $300 billion industry has come roaring back with blockbuster releases like Hogwarts
26:17.080 - 26:24.260:  Legacy, The Legend of Zelda, and Final Fantasy XVI. With details of the latest title hoping
26:24.260 - 26:27.800:  to get in on the action, here's our gaming correspondent Stefan Powell.
26:29.720 - 26:30.280:  Starfield
26:31.940 - 26:36.780:  A sprawling, space epic. It's the big hope for Xbox in 2023.
26:38.700 - 26:44.720:  Exclusive to that console bosses hope it will be popular enough to help them claw back the
26:44.720 - 26:50.440:  gap on the Sony PlayStation 5 which is outselling the competition. It's not just how the ship looks.
26:50.480 - 26:54.780:  It's the brainchild of Todd Howard, game director of some of the most critically acclaimed
26:54.780 - 26:57.900:  titles of recent history. Skyrim and Fallout.
26:58.520 - 27:03.500:  Was the game in your head as ambitious as the game has ended up becoming?
27:03.500 - 27:07.840:  I always start with a tone. Okay, we're going to go out in space. You have a ship, you can land
27:07.840 - 27:12.580:  on planets and it has this kind of science fiction vibe. You know, it wasn't until later
27:12.580 - 27:18.080:  after we finished Fallout 4 we really start designing where you realize how much you have to design.
27:18.080 - 27:24.100:  How much space is big? How much space is in space? It ended up just, you know,
27:24.420 - 27:32.380:  so much larger than anything we had ever done and there were periods where are we in over our
27:32.380 - 27:36.580:  heads. What do you say to those people that might argue that games have got too big?
27:37.060 - 27:40.660:  We've found two things. One, they do play it for a really, really long time, but even if they play
27:40.660 - 27:44.700:  it say for 10 hours or 20 hours and they've finished the main quest and they saved the world,
27:44.700 - 27:51.060:  whatever, that they see all the other choices, that that experience, those 20 hours were different
27:51.060 - 27:57.300:  because they had so much choice. Some critics have been impressed by this score and grandeur,
27:57.300 - 28:03.940:  others have found it a little underwhelming and disjointed. I'm not stopping. As an exclusive release,
28:03.940 - 28:10.880:  it's only available to Xbox and PC players. Change humanity. Talking about audiences and who plays
28:10.880 - 28:17.380:  your game, do you think there is still a place in the industry for exclusive games like this?
28:17.380 - 28:21.920:  When you're making something, the more you can focus, the more you know this is the hardware
28:21.920 - 28:27.880:  or the thing people are going to play on, you know, your ability to focus on that always yields
28:27.880 - 28:36.040:  a better product. I love this part. Having spent £5.5 billion in 2020 on buying the
28:36.040 - 28:41.000:  stewardior that made the game, Microsoft is waiting to see if Starfield can blast away
28:41.000 - 28:45.500:  PlayStation's lead. This is where we belong.
28:47.220 - 28:48.760:  Stefan Powell with that report.
28:51.600 - 28:55.320:  And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
28:55.320 - 28:58.960:  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Emma Joseph,
28:58.960 - 29:02.760:  our editors Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
29:11.420 - 29:15.360:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
29:15.480 - 29:21.480:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they made
29:21.480 - 29:25.720:  their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
29:25.720 - 29:30.660:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos
29:30.660 - 29:36.180:  really did to become the first person in history to pocket $100 billion, listen to Good Bad
29:36.180 - 29:41.080:  billionaire with me, Simon Jack. And me, Zingsing, available now wherever you get your podcasts.
