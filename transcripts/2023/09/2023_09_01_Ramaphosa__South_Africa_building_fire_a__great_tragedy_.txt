00:50.280 - 00:56.200:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they made
00:56.200 - 01:00.460:  their money. And then we decide if they are actually Good Bad or just plain wealthy.

01:04.160 - 01:09.380:  or what Jeff Bezos really did to become the first person in history to pocket $100 billion.
01:09.380 - 01:12.480:  Listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me, Simon Jack.
01:12.480 - 01:15.760:  And me, Zingsing, available now wherever you get your podcasts.
01:19.380 - 01:22.560:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:25.020 - 01:28.500:  I'm Andrew Peach and in the early hours of Friday the 1st of September,
01:28.920 - 01:30.020:  these are our main stories.
01:30.020 - 01:35.180:  The South African president says he wants action taken after a fire in a derelict building
01:35.180 - 01:40.580:  kills dozens. Two former leaders of the far right proud boys get lengthy prison terms
01:40.580 - 01:44.860:  for their role in the storming of the capital building in Washington in 2021.
01:45.680 - 01:50.900:  And Spain's goalkeeper talks to BBC News about the kiss on the lips that's overshadowed
01:50.900 - 01:58.820:  their women's world cup win. Also in this podcast to stand off a Filipino fisherman in the South
01:58.820 - 02:04.440:  China Sea. You might not return to the show, man. We're now scared. We're scared of China.
02:05.000 - 02:08.800:  And Pope Francis is set to become the first pontiff to visit Mongolia.
02:12.780 - 02:18.260:  The South African president, Sarah Ramaposa, has described a deadly fire that killed 74 people,
02:18.260 - 02:23.500:  including 12 children, as a great tragedy. He said he hoped an investigation into the fire
02:23.500 - 02:29.100:  at a derelict five-story building would prevent a repeat of the incident. Mr. Ramaposa was
02:29.100 - 02:34.000:  initially going to give a national address on TV, but cancel that in order to visit the site.
02:34.540 - 02:40.680:  We've got to go to the bottom of what caused this fire, that a building like this which I'm told
02:40.700 - 02:47.580:  used to be a home for abused women and children. Once the lease had expired, it was then
02:47.580 - 02:56.140:  hijacked, and we need to find effective ways of dealing with problems of accommodation of housing
02:56.220 - 03:02.200:  and services in the inner city. A government minister told the BBC that attempts to evict the
03:02.200 - 03:07.620:  squatters have been blocked by the courts. Our correspondent, Pumsifalani, reports from Johannesburg.
03:08.060 - 03:12.160:  As the fire took hold of the five-story building in the centre of Johannesburg,
03:12.600 - 03:20.500:  screams shattered the quiet of the night. It was home to hundreds of people who had to scramble
03:20.500 - 03:26.280:  through the darkness to reach safety. The bodies of some of those who didn't make it were found
03:26.280 - 03:32.680:  piled on top of each other, beside a locked security gate. As day broke, those who escaped,
03:32.680 - 03:38.920:  watched as bodies were pulled out of the gutted building onto the street. Everyone who got out
03:38.920 - 03:44.220:  had their own story of battling their way through the flames, including this man.
03:51.280 - 03:56.540:  The building had been declared unsafe, but still became home to hundreds of migrants from
03:56.540 - 04:02.060:  neighbouring countries, as well as South Africans from poorer provinces who were drawn to the city
04:02.060 - 04:07.700:  by the hope of a better life. Officials have described it as a hijacked structure,
04:07.700 - 04:14.180:  a term used for derelict buildings illegally taken over by property gangs, who rent out each room
04:14.180 - 04:20.500:  individually, often to dozens of people. Conditions in the building were swallowed and crowded,
04:21.060 - 04:26.060:  with around 80-shack-like petitions have hazardly crammed into the block.
04:26.800 - 04:32.420:  Labuchang Maile, who is from the provincial housing department, said those responsible for the
04:32.420 - 04:37.860:  tragedy would be brought to justice. If there's an official of the city,
04:38.640 - 04:43.300:  who would be found to have contravenged or to have neglected their responsibilities,
04:43.300 - 04:50.800:  heads will definitely rot. Survivors face days of uncertainty, having been left without a home
04:50.800 - 04:57.520:  or any belongings, and the hope of finding anyone alive in the rubble is waning as the investigation
04:57.820 - 05:05.080:  into what caused the fire begins. Pomsafalani reporting. The African Union has announced it's
05:05.080 - 05:10.580:  suspending Gabon following Wednesday's coup. The military rulers who ousted President Ali Bongo
05:10.580 - 05:14.080:  moments after he was declared the winner of a disputed presidential election,
05:14.080 - 05:19.760:  say they'll phase in what they call transitional institutions. So what more do we know of their plans?
05:19.760 - 05:24.740:  I've been talking to our Africa Regional Editor Richard Hamilton. They didn't give any details,
05:24.740 - 05:30.960:  but we presume they mean a sort of transitional government, maybe even the judiciary,
05:30.960 - 05:35.680:  but they of course haven't given a timescale for this. They also said that the new
05:35.680 - 05:41.480:  co-leader General Anguema would be sworn in as transitional president on Monday,
05:41.840 - 05:47.820:  and they also tried to reassure donors and development partners that there'd be no defaulting
05:47.820 - 05:52.180:  on debts. So they're trying to give the impression of sort of business as usual.
05:52.760 - 05:56.540:  This time yesterday we were starting to get international reaction from different
05:56.540 - 06:00.080:  organizations from different countries, one by one condemning what had happened,
06:00.220 - 06:04.460:  despite these images on the streets of the capital of people celebrating.
06:04.740 - 06:10.940:  Yeah, it's a very sort of paradoxical situation because the African Union, as we've been hearing,
06:10.940 - 06:17.660:  has condemned it and suspended Gabon, but there's been a more nuanced response, for example,
06:17.660 - 06:24.220:  from the EU's foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell, who said that the situation is calm and there
06:24.220 - 06:33.620:  was no urgency about evacuating foreign nationals. In Gabon, there are no evacuation plans for
06:33.620 - 06:39.860:  the moment. The situation is calm. We do not see any risk of violence, of a situation which
06:39.860 - 06:46.180:  could cause danger. There are about 10,000 European citizens in Gabon, but no country has expressed
06:46.180 - 06:52.600:  any concern. And earlier, Joseph Borrell said that naturally, military coups are not the
06:52.600 - 06:57.840:  solution, but he said we must not forget that in Gabon there had been elections which were full
06:57.840 - 07:03.340:  of what he said irregularities, and he said you could argue that a rigged vote could amount
07:03.340 - 07:09.180:  to an institutional coup. He's not approving of the coup, but at the same time he's saying there
07:09.180 - 07:16.100:  won't be much tears shed for the departure of Ali Bongo and his family that have basically
07:16.100 - 07:23.720:  ruled Gabon for nearly six decades. Richard Hamilton reporting, a third of Gabon's population lives
07:23.720 - 07:29.640:  below the poverty line, despite it being so rich in natural resources. So how big apart
07:29.640 - 07:34.800:  did economic grievances play in this coup? Vivian Nunes has been talking to Ali Khan Satu,
07:34.800 - 07:40.700:  an independent geo-economic analyst based in Nairobi. Gabon, firstly, is a small country for
07:40.700 - 07:50.100:  about 2.4, 2.5 million, produces about 250,000 barrels of crude oil per day, but because the population
07:50.100 - 07:58.000:  is so small, it puts per capita income close to 15,000 US dollars per person. But it's a very unfair
07:58.000 - 08:04.600:  and uneven society, 31% of the youth are unemployed, and the money has not spread, and I think that's one
08:04.600 - 08:11.660:  of the drivers of what's happened here. But more interestingly, it produces 20% of global
08:11.660 - 08:17.440:  manganese. There's a bigger story on the manganese front because it's such a big supplier.
08:18.040 - 08:22.620:  With respect to the Bongo families' wealth, they've been in power for more than 50 years.
08:22.620 - 08:28.080:  Publicized estimates are about a billion dollars. I think that is way under the
08:28.080 - 08:33.400:  I suspect we're talking closer to 5 to 10 billion US dollars. There's been treated as a
08:33.400 - 08:40.180:  fiefdom of the Bongo family for half a century, and really it's been one of the core components of
08:40.180 - 08:46.560:  the France, a freak constellation of countries who gained their independence from France, but never
08:46.560 - 08:53.500:  actually managed to gain real sovereignty. So French companies are dominant. The economic strangled
08:53.540 - 08:59.920:  whole that has been exercised by France is I think one of the key catalysts from eight coups that we've
08:59.920 - 09:07.360:  seen in French Africa since 2020. I guess a lot of the gabanese citizenry would like to see a
09:07.360 - 09:12.600:  restructuring of the country's economy so that more of that wealth does trickle down, and it's a
09:12.600 - 09:18.700:  more fair system, how can that be achieved? It's not rocket science, but you're not painting on
09:18.700 - 09:25.560:  an enormous population canvas. The government has not been interested. It's just incredible. You could
09:25.560 - 09:30.320:  have built hospitals, roads, you could have put in an education system, and none of this was done.
09:30.380 - 09:36.440:  It was nicknamed the Kuwait of Africa. At least they could have done something along those lines.
09:36.440 - 09:42.120:  None of this has happened, and that's why we reached the tipping point moment. But I think overall
09:42.120 - 09:49.300:  what we're seeing is you cannot now be egregiously greedy. You've got to have a better deal for the
09:49.300 - 09:56.120:  average African citizen, particularly in these resource rich countries. And I think unless we see
09:56.120 - 10:01.820:  significant change, this domino effect has got further to go, and further countries are going to
10:01.820 - 10:08.280:  find themselves in the same situation. Ali Khan Sachi with Vivian Noonis. Two leaders of the proud
10:08.280 - 10:13.340:  boys have been handed some of the longest sentences in connection with the 6th of January 2021
10:13.340 - 10:20.760:  attack on the US Capitol. Joseph Biggs was given 17 years. Zachary Real got 15. Mr. Biggs and
10:20.760 - 10:25.860:  Army veteran had claimed he was inside the building to use the toilet, but the judge ruled he was
10:25.860 - 10:31.020:  among the first wave of attackers and also an organizer. Some of you some of Skander got more about
10:31.020 - 10:36.220:  all of this from our North America correspondent Anthony Zirke. As you mentioned, these are two of the
10:36.220 - 10:41.620:  longest sentences in a January 6th related conviction. Although it is interesting to note that in
10:41.620 - 10:47.680:  both cases, the judge departed downward from not only the sentencing guidelines, but what the
10:47.680 - 10:53.500:  prosecutors were asking for as far as sentencing goes. The judge was more lenient towards these
10:53.500 - 10:59.280:  two men than I think was expected. Part of that was while the judge said that there was a terrorism
10:59.280 - 11:04.580:  enhancement that should add time to the sentences, he seemed a little bit skeptical about whether
11:04.580 - 11:09.520:  that enhancement really should apply to these cases because it wasn't clearly an act of terrorism
11:09.520 - 11:14.860:  like blowing up a building. In one case, it was pulling out a fence to let people get into the
11:14.860 - 11:20.400:  Capitol. And in the other case with Zach Raill, it was spraying a police officer with some sort of
11:20.400 - 11:25.380:  a chemical spray and then also lying on the stand. But in both cases, the enhancements were
11:25.380 - 11:30.420:  enough to push this up to 30 years or even more, which would have been within the guidelines.
11:30.420 - 11:35.300:  Yeah, what do we know about what role they played in the attack? Well, Joe Biggs, the prosecution
11:35.300 - 11:40.100:  said he was at the forefront of the mob. He was egging them on. He spoke to someone at some point
11:40.100 - 11:45.400:  and that person then went up and attacked a police officer. He went into the Capitol,
11:46.300 - 11:52.040:  instrumental in the prosecution's view in leading this assault on the Capitol. And then Zach Raill
11:52.040 - 11:57.780:  was also at the forefront of this mob also leading the charge in. So in both cases, one of the reasons
11:57.780 - 12:02.440:  why these sentences still were so high and that they were convicted, the prosecution successfully
12:02.440 - 12:07.620:  proved that these two individuals were leaders that helped provoke the attack on the Capitol,
12:07.620 - 12:11.880:  not just being swept up in the mob, which is what their defense attorneys had asserted.
12:12.140 - 12:17.140:  I'm North America correspondent Anthony Zirke. The US President Joe Biden has said he'll visit
12:17.140 - 12:22.000:  Florida on Saturday to view the extensive damage from Hurricane Adalia after the storm
12:22.000 - 12:24.740:  powered the state with high winds and flooding on Wednesday.
12:25.420 - 12:29.860:  Emergency workers have been drafted in to help and efforts are being made to restore power
12:29.860 - 12:34.480:  for hundreds of thousands of people. One person has been confirmed dead in Georgia.
12:35.000 - 12:39.920:  This resident in Western Florida had to evacuate. We're not allowed to go back to our houses
12:39.920 - 12:43.720:  until the sheriff makes an announcement. They said it'd be a day or two. But in the meantime,
12:43.720 - 12:48.280:  our house is sitting up under three, four foot of water. Somebody did a drone in our neighborhood
12:48.720 - 12:55.160:  and you can see my neighbor's car is completely underwater. So therefore, I know I have at least four
12:55.160 - 12:59.720:  feet. I'm still a little bit in shock. The boys don't understand why they can't go home.
13:00.320 - 13:03.300:  There's also been concerned about the impact on the region's wildlife.
13:03.300 - 13:08.860:  Victoria O'Hunder spoke to Dr. Tracy Fanara, who's an environmental engineer and marine expert
13:08.860 - 13:14.500:  in Tampa. I got in the car and I drove right before the peak of the surge and it was nuts.
13:15.040 - 13:20.720:  Water was coming up almost all the way to the door of the house, which that has never happened.
13:20.720 - 13:26.200:  Down in St. Pete, my sister's neighborhood is completely shut down. You can't get in or out.
13:26.320 - 13:30.160:  Every single house has two inches to five feet of water.
13:30.320 - 13:36.120:  One of the most affected areas was thought to be the big band and it's one of those
13:36.460 - 13:42.420:  last natural places in the state of Florida. I'm just wondering what kind of effect this may have had
13:42.420 - 13:48.620:  on the wildlife there? It's such a special place over there in Cedar Key and there is so much
13:49.060 - 13:54.500:  natural wildlife there. With sharks and whales, they know to go offshore. They can sense a hurricane
13:54.500 - 13:59.740:  coming most species at least. When it comes to alligators, they know to seek shelter, but when it
13:59.740 - 14:06.560:  comes to birds and trees and other organisms that take shelter and trees and vegetation, their homes
14:06.560 - 14:12.000:  can be completely destroyed. And on top of that, with all of the rainfall runoff coming into the
14:12.000 - 14:18.060:  coastal waters, that changes their ecosystem. So there's a lot of aftermath that comes with a
14:18.060 - 14:22.800:  storm event. This is a state that is known to have alligators and crocodiles. And I would
14:22.800 - 14:27.620:  just mention that they will seek shelter. And I'm thinking people are evacuating and you've got
14:27.620 - 14:33.620:  these huge animals out and about. How do you prevent them from getting in contact with humans?
14:33.700 - 14:39.220:  That's a really, really good question. And it's especially difficult when there's new development
14:39.220 - 14:46.360:  because that was their home. But in general, alligators stay in swamp lands. They stay in areas that
14:46.360 - 14:53.100:  normally humans aren't. I mean, they can end up in a pool and a residential area that does happen
14:53.100 - 14:59.480:  sometimes. But in general, they're in the canalways, the swamps. So as far as the alligators go and
14:59.480 - 15:05.740:  crossing paths during evacuations, I haven't noticed it to be an increase in interactions.
15:05.820 - 15:12.280:  I'm just wondering, how do you recover? How do you rebuild the ecosystem going forward?
15:12.560 - 15:19.280:  There are so many ways, living seawalls, making sure that we are not overdeveloping,
15:19.380 - 15:24.800:  because we weaken the roots of trees that may be depending on each other. And so those trees
15:24.800 - 15:30.640:  are more likely to fall. Stop using so much carbon dioxide so that the next salineo isn't
15:30.640 - 15:36.320:  worse than this one. And so that intensity doesn't keep on accelerating to a point where we've
15:36.320 - 15:41.580:  never seen it before. Officials in the Philippines have told the BBC, they won't be
15:41.580 - 15:47.460:  daunted by Beijing in a territorial standoff in the South China Sea. Earlier this month, the Chinese
15:47.460 - 15:52.980:  vessel used water cannon to deter the Filipino coast guard from getting near a contested reef,
15:52.980 - 15:59.040:  which had been awarded to Manila in an international tribunal. In a show of solidarity, the US has held
15:59.040 - 16:04.340:  joint drills in the region with Japan, Australia, and denounced China's behaviour as aggressive.
16:05.020 - 16:08.860:  From the island of Palawan, here's our Asia-Pacific correspondent Laura Bicker.
16:11.240 - 16:17.480:  School has been cancelled in Palawan as wind and rain lashed the island. The children celebrate
16:17.480 - 16:27.480:  by playing basketball. So one day will you fish in these boats? The houses are made of
16:27.480 - 16:33.820:  corrugated iron, very little protection against rain or wind, but this is how they've lived for
16:33.820 - 16:38.620:  generations. The people of this island are used to battling the weather, but now they're
16:38.620 - 16:44.240:  countries in a standoff with Beijing, over who owns which, valuable fishing ground and reef in the
16:44.240 - 16:53.500:  South China Sea. We might not return to the show, man. We're scared of China. We were harassed
16:53.700 - 16:59.220:  and they even asked us to leave. Benjo at Thai started fishing in the contested waters around
16:59.220 - 17:06.320:  a human show at the age of 14. Now in his 30s, he believes Beijing's fishing fleets are becoming
17:06.320 - 17:13.160:  more aggressive. It's getting harder each year, and we are only allowed on a limited number of
17:13.160 - 17:18.300:  islands due to others being occupied by different countries. The fishermen have been asked to join
17:18.300 - 17:24.920:  a militia to help defend Filipino territory, but life is already forged in saltwater and sweat,
17:25.440 - 17:31.360:  while stealing boats made of simple bamboo. They have no wish to take on a global superpower.
17:34.920 - 17:42.720:  If we stand God, how can we feed our families? What we need is to fish. That's our goal, out in the sea.
17:42.940 - 17:50.500:  The Chinese fired their water cannons at the Filipino Coast Guard earlier this month. Beijing
17:50.500 - 17:56.740:  argued it's protecting its sovereignty, its claims in the South China Sea, and will continue to do so.
17:56.960 - 18:02.940:  Really, it is a David versus Belaya issue. Jonathan Malaya is Assistant Director General of the
18:02.940 - 18:08.100:  Filipino National Security Council. But just like David, we will continue to pound and double
18:08.380 - 18:13.400:  down on the need to protect the resources which are important for the future of the Philippines.
18:13.400 - 18:19.960:  Resolved to keep hold of its reefs, the Philippines deliberately ran aground a rusting world war
18:19.960 - 18:26.700:  two ship on what is known as a human show in 1999. It is their territory under UN law,
18:27.560 - 18:32.580:  but resupplying trips on board with fresh water and food has become increasingly tense,
18:32.580 - 18:38.200:  as they are often blocked by the Chinese Coast Guard. In a show of solidarity and strength,
18:38.200 - 18:43.200:  the Japanese, the Australians and the US have all sent warships to the region.
18:45.580 - 18:48.640:  I can imagine in the wet conditions this would be difficult.
18:50.240 - 18:55.920:  We were given a tour of the J.S. Izumo and told very little about joint drills or operations,
18:55.980 - 19:01.540:  but the message from all four nations is they stand together, which has given Manila
19:01.820 - 19:07.580:  a certain confidence. We do not have the resources of China, while international law is on our side,
19:08.220 - 19:13.880:  we need the support of our dear countries. Allied help comes with the risk of escalating
19:13.880 - 19:18.620:  this dispute. Nowhere else in the world do these nations come so close to one another,
19:19.140 - 19:26.840:  which also raises the fear of a miscalculation it see. Back on Palawan, the children's future was once
19:26.840 - 19:33.120:  determined by the island's tides. Now it may depend on a test of will and the resolve of their
19:33.120 - 19:39.080:  parents and leaders, a struggle that could shape the future of the South China Sea and to some extent
19:39.080 - 19:46.540:  the rest of the world. Laura Bica reporting. Still to come in the global news podcast?
19:47.240 - 19:54.060:  It shows a man taking his bull for a ride. They were coming from Nili Nebraska and heading to Norfolk,
19:54.060 - 19:59.920:  Nebraska. He was just taking him for a ride. That's right, the cow that likes being taken for a drive
19:59.920 - 20:04.740:  coming up. Just before we move on, I wanted to mention the happy part, our weekly roundup of the
20:04.740 - 20:09.940:  most uplifting and positive news stories in the world. You'll find it in this feed every Saturday.

20:36.860 - 20:39.940:  and we'll include some of them in the happy pod next week.
20:47.280 - 20:53.640:  Africa is facing a debt crisis as bad as anything seen before caused by rising global interest rates
20:53.640 - 20:59.140:  inflation and a lack of finance from lenders like the world bank. That's the warning in a major
20:59.140 - 21:05.280:  new report by the one campaign. It's chief executive is gale smith. We are facing a debt crisis
21:05.280 - 21:09.740:  that is likely to be bigger than the one we saw some 20 years ago when there was a huge
21:09.740 - 21:15.620:  initiative by the international community to deal with what was then a major debt crisis for
21:15.620 - 21:20.900:  poor country. The urge to borrow billions and literally couldn't pay it back and start to
21:20.900 - 21:25.440:  develop their economies at the same time. This is more countries simultaneously heading into
21:25.900 - 21:30.100:  crisis and they're huge lost opportunities that we're going to see if this isn't forced all.
21:30.400 - 21:35.100:  There are potential solutions. The question is are the world's wealthier countries going to
21:35.100 - 21:41.080:  seize the opportunity to put those solutions into effect. More on this from Joe Inwood. Nigeria now
21:41.080 - 21:46.840:  spends more than twice as much on debt repayments as it does on health care and education combined.
21:47.700 - 21:52.340:  That is just one example of the stark reality facing Africa according to this report.
21:53.180 - 21:57.660:  The one campaign, a group involving the former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers,
21:58.080 - 22:02.800:  the former Metaboss Cheryl Sandberg, and the former UK Prime Minister David Cameron,
22:02.800 - 22:08.260:  claims countries on the continent are paying 500% more for loans than they need to,
22:08.260 - 22:14.840:  with a cost over the next few years of $56 billion. It says the consequences will be felt
22:14.840 - 22:20.720:  outside Africa, with increased mass migration, less action on climate change and a fragmenting
22:20.720 - 22:25.740:  of the global economy. The report calls for a massive expansion of loans from lenders like
22:25.740 - 22:31.620:  the IMF and World Bank, and says that the problem can be solved, but action needs to be taken
22:31.620 - 22:36.480:  urgently. The Spanish football boss to each rubiales is hanging on to his job,
22:36.480 - 22:41.940:  despite mounting calls for him to resign. He's accused of kissing the player Jenny Amoso,
22:41.940 - 22:46.900:  without her consent, at the Women's World Cup Final, which has led to debates about sexism
22:46.900 - 22:52.620:  and the abuse of power in Spain. For the players, it feels a bit like their moment of glory is
22:52.620 - 22:57.140:  all but forgotten. Here's Spain's World Cup winning goalkeeper, Catalina Cole.
23:00.480 - 23:06.100:  I feel sorry that the 23 footballers aren't the protagonists. What I'm disappointed about is that
23:06.100 - 23:10.840:  now everyone who stops you on the street talks to you about the scandal and doesn't say
23:10.840 - 23:16.220:  congratulations on the World Cup. Or they say congratulations, but then focus on that.
23:17.180 - 23:22.480:  I think we are sad about all this, but hey, I believe and trust that everything is going to be fixed.
23:22.480 - 23:27.820:  And that everything will work out. Catalina Cole was speaking to Joseph Carlos Quato
23:27.820 - 23:32.840:  from BBC Mundo, who's been telling me more about their conversation. I have to highlight
23:32.840 - 23:37.260:  how proud they are and how happy they are that the people are congratulated the main
23:37.260 - 23:42.900:  district that they didn't use to happen in the past, but it is true also that she sounded sad
23:42.900 - 23:47.500:  when she had to mention how disappointed she and the rest of the thing are with all these
23:47.500 - 23:52.780:  controversies that is overshadowing their achievements. But she also said that they feel strong
23:52.780 - 23:56.900:  and at the same time they are feeling confident that this whole situation is going to end up
23:57.040 - 24:02.260:  well for them in this case. Pressure continues to mount day after day on Luis Rubiales.
24:02.260 - 24:07.560:  These things usually end with the person leaving their role in some way, shape or form.
24:07.560 - 24:11.860:  Do you think that's going to happen in the end here? Given all the pressure that is from him,
24:12.020 - 24:16.960:  a lot of people were thinking that he was going to be out already, but he's still resisting.
24:16.960 - 24:21.700:  Even though his mother was admitted to hospital, he was released today after declaring
24:21.700 - 24:27.260:  herself on hunger strike as a way of defending Luis Rubiales. He's suspended by FIFA,
24:27.260 - 24:32.500:  investigated by Spanish prosecutors, waiting for a resolution from the Spanish sports
24:32.500 - 24:37.680:  tribunal to also decide whether they open investigations or not. But yeah, it's the big question
24:37.680 - 24:41.120:  if he finally will reside and when will this happen?
24:41.680 - 24:47.080:  Joe's the Carlos Cuesta of BBC Mundo. Many people with COVID-19 get better in a few days
24:47.080 - 24:52.120:  or weeks, but for a significant minority, the symptoms can carry on for months or longer.
24:52.720 - 24:57.620:  It's called Long COVID. Until now, it's not been clear what causes it. Scientists here in
24:57.620 - 25:03.260:  Britain have identified one of its physical manifestations, brain fog. The teams from the
25:03.260 - 25:07.740:  universities of Oxford and Leicester say this is the first step to treating the condition
25:08.240 - 25:11.840:  or even preventing it. It's from our health correspondent Catherine Burns.
25:12.720 - 25:19.000:  It's three years since Dr Simon Rettford got coronavirus. He says Long COVID means he's still only
25:19.000 - 25:24.660:  back to about 60 or 70 percent of his old abilities, both physically and mentally.
25:24.960 - 25:31.440:  I know we realise that the cognitive side of things the impairment has been more serious
25:31.440 - 25:38.180:  in the physical side. The so-called brain fog, the short-term memory loss, the loss of a
25:38.180 - 25:44.760:  vocabulary, particularly concentration. That said, tragically, a lot of people are no longer here.
25:45.420 - 25:53.160:  I am, you know, and I've certainly seen a glass half full attitude to life as I know, know it.
25:53.520 - 25:58.420:  For him, this study is about tackling the unknown question, why does some people get
25:58.420 - 26:04.640:  long COVID? Researchers think they might have some answers. They studied 1800 people who'd been
26:04.640 - 26:09.800:  in hospital with COVID and found evidence of two proteins linked to blood clots.
26:10.200 - 26:13.780:  The theory is that the clots happen in the acute stage of the infection,
26:13.780 - 26:19.660:  then go away, but the damage they cause doesn't and leads to long COVID problems,
26:19.660 - 26:25.580:  such as brain fog and extreme fatigue. Dr Max Takay is the study's author.
26:25.820 - 26:29.100:  It's a first step in a gypsy, but it's an important step. This is really exciting.
26:29.720 - 26:33.020:  It's also exciting in the sense that this is something that we know how to treat potentially,
26:33.520 - 26:36.840:  and therefore this might well be a very important step in the gypsy or brain fog.
26:36.960 - 26:41.800:  There's more work to be done here, but he hopes for a treatment for people who already have
26:41.800 - 26:47.260:  long COVID, possibly the type of intensive brain rehabilitation given to stroke patients.
26:48.020 - 26:53.420:  And looking further ahead, a treatment to stop COVID patients developing this problem at all.
26:54.320 - 26:58.820:  Next to a tiny community with a huge global figure about to visit.
26:59.260 - 27:03.800:  Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to go to Mongolia. The country is strategically
27:03.800 - 27:08.420:  placed, bordering Russia and China, so what's Pope Francis trying to achieve?
27:08.420 - 27:12.840:  Aliza and Alan is a correspondent for the Catholic online newspaper Crux,
27:13.140 - 27:18.540:  and she's been talking to Nulam Agavan. There are always going to be some sort of geopolitical
27:18.540 - 27:22.780:  reasons behind the visit, but there are also going to be personal reasons. But he's also ahead of
27:22.860 - 27:27.760:  state, and the Vatican is a sovereign diplomatic entity. So it has those relations that it maintains,
27:27.760 - 27:32.460:  and there's going to be an element of politics along the way. This trip, as you mentioned, is historic.
27:32.460 - 27:38.180:  This is the very first trip a pope will ever take to Mongolia. No pope is ever been to China or to
27:38.180 - 27:42.760:  Russia, which are Mongolia's biggest neighbors. Pope Francis himself has made great efforts to
27:42.760 - 27:46.980:  reach out to both of these countries, and he signed an agreement on the appointment of bishops with
27:46.980 - 27:53.420:  China in 2018, and recently proposed the establishment of a permanent liaison office in Beijing.
27:53.420 - 27:58.420:  And of course, Pope Francis has been very interested in trying to engage Russia over the
27:58.420 - 28:03.360:  current war in Ukraine. He wants to be able to help negotiate some sort of peace agreement,
28:03.360 - 28:08.580:  and he's trying to talk with everybody involved on that. I don't think he's going to address either
28:08.580 - 28:12.180:  of these countries directly while he's there, but I'm sure there are going to be some
28:12.180 - 28:16.460:  subtleties on what he says that are going to be relevant. But on the pastoral side, this is the
28:16.460 - 28:21.520:  first trip of a pope to Mongolia. The Catholic Church there is extremely small. I mean, I was
28:21.520 - 28:28.280:  struck by that. 1500 people are really who he's going to see. Exactly. It is one of the Catholic
28:28.280 - 28:33.780:  Church's smallest flocks, but Pope Francis has always been a lover of what he calls the global
28:33.780 - 28:39.280:  periphery, societal peripheries, ecclesial peripheries, but it's also sort of a new church that's
28:39.280 - 28:44.860:  starting to really establish itself again after communism. In the papers today, there's a lot
28:44.860 - 28:51.080:  of discussion about him addressing Russian youth via video and some pushback really from Ukraine
28:51.080 - 28:57.220:  about telling them to remember their heritage. Are you able to address topics like that with the
28:57.220 - 29:01.900:  Pope? Yes, and I would expect that to come up Pope Francis is somebody that has tried to walk
29:01.900 - 29:08.200:  a very careful line on the Ukraine war so far. The Vatican has always tried to maintain neutrality.
29:08.200 - 29:12.540:  It doesn't like to appear to take one side and the other and Francis has tried to do that.
29:12.540 - 29:16.980:  And I think sometimes he's just putting his mouth sometimes. I don't think Pope Francis minds
29:16.980 - 29:22.100:  the blowback. I think he knows what his intentions are. How would you describe him? I mean,
29:22.100 - 29:25.780:  you've had much more interaction with Pope Francis than many of us will ever have.
29:26.380 - 29:33.200:  That's true. I would describe Pope Francis as somebody who is still very much at heart a parish priest.
29:33.600 - 29:38.280:  Somebody who never wanted to leave the slums of Buenos Aires, he could name all his parishioners.
29:38.280 - 29:42.740:  That's the same type of approach he really likes to have as Pope. And he's trying to apply that
29:42.740 - 29:47.200:  at a more universal level, encouraging pastors as he often does to be closer to their people.
29:47.200 - 29:52.480:  But he's very savvy. He is a great mind. He's extremely intelligent. He speaks very simply,
29:52.480 - 29:58.200:  but he's very strategic and he's just gifted in being able to explain some of the churches,
29:58.700 - 30:02.820:  read teachings or what he wants from the church. He's very simple language. It's very accessible
30:02.820 - 30:07.460:  to people. And I think that's part of what the appeal that's made him so popular over the last decade.
30:07.960 - 30:12.520:  At least Anne Allen from the Catholic News site, Crocs. Now, here's something you don't see every day.
30:12.520 - 30:17.620:  Police in Norfolk, Nebraska, pulled over a man driving on a motorway with a huge,
30:17.620 - 30:23.340:  where to see ball strapped into the passenger seat. The ball is named Howdy Doody.
30:23.800 - 30:29.080:  And we're seeing standing with most of its body outside this modified white vehicle.
30:29.660 - 30:35.060:  The car had half of its roof cut off to fit the animal in. And the trip was cut short after police
30:35.060 - 30:39.920:  took a call from a startled onlooker. Captain Chad Ryman is from Norfolk Police.
30:40.700 - 30:46.120:  The officers received a call, reference, a car driving into town that had a cow in it.
30:46.340 - 30:50.420:  They thought that it was going to be a calf, something small. There were some suitable issues.
30:50.860 - 30:55.220:  The officer chose to write him a warning and ask him to take the animal back home.
30:55.940 - 30:59.680:  So just to be clear, the owner wasn't taking Howdy Doody to the vet or anything like that.
30:59.680 - 31:04.800:  This is one of the most viewed videos at BBC.com slash news. It came from
31:04.800 - 31:09.600:  news channel Nebraska. And I've been talking to the assistant director there, Cajun Novak.
31:09.920 - 31:15.540:  It shows a man taking his bull for a ride down the highway. They were coming from
31:15.540 - 31:21.240:  Neely Nebraska and heading to Norfolk, Nebraska for an evening stroll. And that was in the morning.
31:21.240 - 31:28.400:  He was just taking him for a ride. Why? He does this often for parades. There was no parade in
31:28.400 - 31:35.300:  town this time though. So it was just a random Wednesday drive, I guess. And when the bull is
31:35.300 - 31:41.400:  almost bigger than the car, how is the bull attached to the car? How is he secured there?
31:41.620 - 31:49.260:  So the man driving, he has kind of done a makeshift with an old police vehicle where he took out the
31:49.260 - 31:54.300:  passenger drawer and added a little bit to it as well as a gate to hold the bull in.
31:54.500 - 31:59.360:  Bulls are not known for being compliant creatures. I mean, quite the opposite. So he must have
31:59.800 - 32:03.600:  must have been enjoying it. Because otherwise he presumably would have had something to say about it.
32:03.640 - 32:08.620:  I'm sure the years of being in parades has gotten him used to it. And the man himself has said that
32:08.620 - 32:14.280:  him and the bull are best of friends. And what sort of reaction was this getting on the streets of
32:14.280 - 32:18.440:  Norfolk, Nebraska? Were people just going, it's that guy again, the guy we've seen before in the
32:18.440 - 32:23.020:  parades or people shocked or what? There were some people who were shocked, yes. And then there
32:23.020 - 32:27.660:  were some people who were like, Oh, he does this all the time, just leave him be. He's having a good
32:27.660 - 32:33.020:  time. Several who were also like, Oh, I've seen him in parades before. So he is pretty well known in
32:33.020 - 32:37.160:  this area. But there were still some people who were like, what is going on right now?
32:37.920 - 32:43.140:  And I understand that the wife of the bull owner called your radio station earlier. What did she say?
32:43.380 - 32:49.820:  She just said that it was them going out for a ride and he he'll go out in the pasture and stuff
32:49.820 - 32:55.200:  with his bull and just kind of hang out. I think she finds it kind of funny that we took a story
32:55.200 - 33:00.700:  and with it on this. Okay, Dra Nova. Can there a remarkable story of how do you do the the bull
33:00.700 - 33:07.520:  who went for a drive with his owner? And that's all from us for now. There will be a new edition
