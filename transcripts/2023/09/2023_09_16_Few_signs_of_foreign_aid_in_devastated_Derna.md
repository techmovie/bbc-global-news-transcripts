*00:00.000- 00:03.660* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.980- 00:10.560* :  Hi, I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Saturday, the 16th of September,
*00:10.560- 00:16.900* :  these are our main stories. The BBC reaches Libya's city of Derna after the deadly floods
*00:16.900- 00:23.060* :  and finds international aid agencies a yet to arrive in force. President Macross says the French
*00:23.060- 00:28.820* :  ambassador to Niger is being held hostage at the embassy in the Arne, and the former president
*00:28.820- 00:34.680* :  of Spanish football is given a restraining order as the World Cup kiss case reaches court.
*00:35.300- 00:41.120* :  Everyone saw the images, the whole country saw it. We can show that Mr. Rubialis lacked consent.
*00:43.220- 00:49.720* :  Also in this podcast, 30 years since the Oslo Accords failed to bring peace to the Middle East,
*00:50.140- 00:54.880* :  and the supersizing Colombian artist Fernando Batero has died.
*00:58.620- 01:03.960* :  So far only a trickle of international aid is beginning to arrive in eastern Libya after
*01:03.960- 01:09.240* :  the devastating floods in which thousands of people were killed. The political infighting between
*01:09.240- 01:14.400* :  local officials in the city of Derna and the internationally recognised government in Tripoli
*01:14.400- 01:20.020* :  is hampering the relief efforts. The United Nations says its redeployed a team sent to
*01:20.020- 01:27.120* :  assist in the aftermath of Morocco's earthquake to Libya to coordinate help for as many as 900,000
*01:27.120- 01:33.340* :  people affected by the floods. Our correspondent Anna Foster managed to reach Derna from where she
*01:33.340- 01:40.980* :  sent this report. Even by night, Derna's recovery teams don't sleep. As darkness falls, another body
*01:40.980- 01:47.560* :  is carefully pulled from the ruins, wrapped and taken to a waiting ambulance. It's a scene that's
*01:47.560- 01:55.600* :  now been repeated thousands of times. I can't describe when you see a people death and maybe when
*01:55.600- 02:05.660* :  you see one or two, you can't hold yourself. But when you see maybe it's 500 people in one street,
*02:06.940- 02:16.140* :  there's women, child, all people. Two dams meant to protect the city were broken apart by the
*02:16.140- 02:22.680* :  force of the water. The deluge carried everything away with it. This wave of death and destruction
*02:22.680- 02:29.840* :  sealed the fate of thousands. And glimpses of the horror are still emerging. Here in Derna people began
*02:29.840- 02:37.360* :  to pray for God's mercy. When the torrent passed, some were able to escape. As the rain continued to
*02:37.360- 02:43.080* :  fall, they headed to the rooftops, with few understanding the scale of the unfolding catastrophe.
*02:43.800- 02:49.540* :  Down below, the force of the water swept away everything in its wake. Those who could
*02:49.540- 02:55.220* :  sought safety on higher ground. It's things like this that really show you the explosive
*02:55.280- 03:01.800* :  power of the water that cascaded through this city. Things like cars that have been picked up
*03:02.120- 03:07.380* :  and crushed all through these streets that have been trees ripped from their roots. And you can see
*03:07.380- 03:13.640* :  now this scar on the landscape where buildings once stood, people once lived. And there's nothing left.
*03:14.660- 03:20.680* :  Rescuers are still working here day and night. And perhaps in probably almost a week after
*03:20.680- 03:26.640* :  this disaster, there are still hopes of survival. Speak to us so we can find where you are,
*03:26.640- 03:33.040* :  the team calls out. Turkish rescuers wade through the pools of destruction in search of what remains.
*03:33.180- 03:40.660* :  The thick mud and dirt coats everything and makes the work slow and dangerous. The risk of disease
*03:40.660- 03:47.180* :  is growing. Our feelings towards the city is very difficult to describe to be honest with you.
*03:47.180- 03:54.060* :  We lost friends, relatives and a big portion of Dernar society. People are returning to Dernar,
*03:54.060- 04:01.240* :  not to resume their lives, but to identify the dead. The bodies keep coming, laid out on city
*04:01.240- 04:06.960* :  pavements in the hope they might be claimed. Eastern Libya has been hideously transformed.
*04:07.100- 04:13.000* :  We traveled across a shattered landscape. Dernar's distinctive mosque, a lone survivor,
*04:13.000- 04:18.560* :  among the ravaged homes and smashed bridge that once stood here. In our beta,
*04:18.560- 04:26.260* :  Ahmad al-Hawal says life as he knew it has ended. It came from here, completely washed away the valley,
*04:26.260- 04:33.160* :  it hit the wall and destroyed everything around it. Ahmad is one of more than 30,000 people desperate
*04:33.160- 04:39.360* :  for shelter, food and water. Libya's eastern government failed to protect them from this disaster.
*04:40.080- 04:44.440* :  Now, in their greatest hour of need, it's struggling to cope with the aftermath.
*04:45.160- 04:51.200* :  Anna Foster in Dernar. President Emmanuel Macron says Francis Ambassador to Niger,
*04:51.860- 04:57.420* :  Sylvan Itay is being held hostage at the French Embassy in Niamé. Mr. Macron
*04:57.420- 05:01.500* :  accuses the military junta which seized power in July of blocking food deliveries.
*05:02.020- 05:06.300* :  The coup leaders gave the French Ambassador two days to leave Niger in August,
*05:06.300- 05:11.800* :  but the French government refused to comply. Paris has not recognised the new military regime
*05:11.800- 05:18.040* :  in William reports. Mr. Macron told journalists that Ambassador Sylvan Itay was literally being
*05:18.040- 05:23.280* :  held hostage in the French Embassy in the capital Niamé. He said the military junta was blocking
*05:23.280- 05:27.980* :  deliveries of food and would not allow the Ambassador to go out, so he and other diplomatic staff
*05:27.980- 05:32.740* :  were being forced to leave off military rations. Mr. Macron said Paris would act in agreement
*05:32.740- 05:36.540* :  with Mohammed Basoum, the deposed president, who still being detained in the country.
*05:37.240- 05:42.100* :  Paris considers Mr. Basoum the legitimate head of state. Niger's military leaders have also told
*05:42.100- 05:47.260* :  France to withdraw his force of 1,500 soldiers who were there to combat a jihadist insurgency.
*05:48.020- 05:52.920* :  President Macron has already said that any redeployment will be decided together with Mr. Basoum.
*05:53.300- 05:57.440* :  Ian McWilliam. The former president of Spain's Football Federation,
*05:57.440- 06:02.940* :  Louis Rubiales, has been given a restraining order by a judge preventing him from approaching
*06:02.940- 06:08.820* :  Jenny Hamoso. The player he kissed when she and her teammates were celebrating Spain's victory
*06:09.200- 06:14.240* :  in the women's World Cup final. He appeared in a Madrid court following a criminal complaint
*06:14.240- 06:20.500* :  of sexual assault and coercion. Mr. Rubiales denied the claims and insisted the kiss was consensual.
*06:20.880- 06:24.620* :  Miss Hamoso's lawyer, Carla Val spoke outside court.
*06:27.120- 06:33.560* :  We can stand up what we said from the start. It was a kiss without consent. Everyone saw the
*06:33.560- 06:39.980* :  images and we can say that precisely because of that, we can show that Mr. Rubiales lacked consent.
*06:40.800- 06:45.940* :  Meanwhile, the announcement of Spain's women's squad to play Sweden next Friday,
*06:45.940- 06:51.200* :  their first match since winning the World Cup has been delayed indefinitely. 39 players
*06:51.200- 06:56.400* :  reaffirmed their boycott of the national team, claiming the resignation of the president and the
*06:56.400- 07:02.540* :  sacking of the coach, Yorga Vilder had not gone far enough. Semra Hunter, a women's football
*07:02.540- 07:07.300* :  reporter based in Spain gave us her assessment. I think a lot of people are watching with a lot of
*07:07.300- 07:12.380* :  attention and curiosity to see how this plays out because it could bring about a monumental shift
*07:12.380- 07:18.140* :  in wider society as well if in fact he has found guilty and subsequently does face some very
*07:18.140- 07:22.100* :  serious consequences. This of course comes as a result of a new law that was put into place
*07:22.540- 07:27.620* :  last year and it would be the first time in such a major scale that something like this could
*07:27.620- 07:33.000* :  actually happen in terms of somebody found guilty of a crime as it relates to sexual aggression.
*07:33.120- 07:37.460* :  But I think it's really interesting how this is all playing out, especially today as well,
*07:37.920- 07:41.880* :  in parallel to all of this, there's other news going on as it relates to the women's Spanish
*07:41.880- 07:47.360* :  national team. The 23 World Cup winners are going to continue to go on strike that they are not
*07:47.360- 07:51.840* :  going to heed the call of the new coach and that they're not going to come back until further
*07:51.840- 07:57.540* :  structural changes are put into place. It's a very rapidly evolving situation here and it
*07:57.540- 08:02.660* :  does very much have the attention, I think, of not just the football fan here in Spain but a lot
*08:02.660- 08:08.400* :  of people across wider society as well because there's so much links between the culture and society
*08:08.400- 08:15.340* :  as well as what's happening in the football realm. Semra Hunter. It's taken nearly half a century
*08:15.340- 08:20.820* :  but a man who says he was tortured during the final months of General Franco's dictatorship has
*08:20.820- 08:27.060* :  testified in court. Julio Pacheco was a left-wing activist when he was arrested. He says the
*08:27.060- 08:35.740* :  matter is important to him even after all this time. Whether there will be a trial or no trial,
*08:35.740- 08:42.040* :  that I don't know, but yes, to have a trial and to see the torturers, those who tortured me,
*08:42.440- 08:51.220* :  in the doc, for me, that would be the important thing. His wife, Rosa Garcia, says she was also tortured.
*08:51.700- 08:56.420* :  Europe Regional Editor Danny Abahart told me more about the decades-old case.
*08:56.920- 09:03.680* :  It goes back to 1975. That's when Julio Pacheco was arrested along with Rosa Garcia, his now wife.
*09:04.260- 09:10.060* :  This was months before General Francisco Franco died. He, of course, was the man who'd ruled Spain
*09:10.060- 09:16.860* :  since the Civil War of the late 1930s and then two years after he died, the Spanish Parliament
*09:16.860- 09:20.980* :  passed an amnesty which applied to opponents of the regime, but also, of course, to
*09:20.980- 09:27.120* :  frankest officials and officers. That has been used, basically, to shield people from prosecution.
*09:27.300- 09:31.800* :  So cases haven't gone anywhere. They've often been archived or just rejected completely.
*09:32.580- 09:36.980* :  So Spain's search for justice, actually, in recent years, has come closer to an Argentina
*09:36.980- 09:42.360* :  with where some activists have filed cases and there's an ongoing investigation into genocide
*09:42.360- 09:47.020* :  and crimes against humanity conducted from Argentina which has its own history of dictatorship.
*09:47.020- 09:53.460* :  On the principles of universal jurisdiction, now supporters of the victims of Franco in Spain
*09:53.460- 10:00.560* :  argue that torture is a crime against humanity and so that the amnesty from 1977 and the
*10:00.560- 10:05.760* :  statute of limitations in Spain doesn't apply. But there's a tension here between domestic law
*10:06.040- 10:11.580* :  and international law and up to now domestic laws always taken precedence. Julio Pacheco,
*10:11.760- 10:16.340* :  it was arrested when he was 19, he's now a pensioner so a lot of time has passed.
*10:16.660- 10:21.020* :  Where does this go from here? Yeah, he was applauded by a small group of supporters outside
*10:21.020- 10:27.080* :  the court when he and his wife came out and he hopes that it opens a chink in the immunity
*10:27.080- 10:32.740* :  that grandkiss offenders had had for all this time and could set a precedent. The judge obviously
*10:32.740- 10:39.200* :  has to rule on whether the case actually goes to trial. She will also summon the one living
*10:39.200- 10:44.840* :  policeman who is alleged to have conducted the torture and she will also try to get documentation
*10:44.840- 10:50.080* :  both from the National Archive and the police. There are about 100 cases that have been presented
*10:50.080- 10:54.420* :  at the courts. Most of those have been archived automatically and there have been five in more
*10:54.420- 10:59.160* :  recent times since the law of historical memory was passed by the current socialist led government
*10:59.160- 11:06.040* :  but this is the first one to actually come to court. Dani Abahat, security has been titaned in
*11:06.040- 11:11.280* :  Iran ahead of the first anniversary on Saturday of the death of the Kurdish Iranian woman
*11:11.280- 11:17.300* :  Masa Amani which triggered nationwide protests. The 22-year-old had been arrested for allegedly
*11:17.300- 11:22.340* :  violating the dress code for women when she died in the custody of the morality police.
*11:22.800- 11:28.160* :  After several months the regime succeeded in crushing the protests but not the widespread
*11:28.160- 11:33.620* :  desire for change. The authorities have carried out waves of arrest over the past few weeks to
*11:33.620- 11:39.520* :  prevent new unrest but every day young women are still carrying out daily acts of defiance
*11:39.940- 11:46.680* :  as Caroline Hawley reports. A town in northern Iran last September as protests spread around the
*11:46.680- 11:53.100* :  country. A brutal crackdown is underway against an uprising led by women furious at decades of
*11:53.100- 11:59.620* :  repression, have been told what they should wear and how they should behave. I've come to Italy
*11:59.620- 12:06.300* :  to the suburbs of Milan to meet a young woman a 33-year-old who suffered horribly at the hands of
*12:06.300- 12:12.600* :  the regime. Elahe tablokian shows me video of the moment that changed her life. She'd never
*12:12.600- 12:18.440* :  protested before but felt compelled to after Masa Amini's death. She was trying to help people
*12:18.440- 12:22.220* :  injured while pulling down pictures of the supreme leader. She was shot herself.
*12:22.780- 12:31.380* :  The last moment I was with my children before I was shot I had bought them school supplies.
*12:31.380- 12:37.100* :  All their clothes and hands were covered with blood and they kept shouting my mom was killed.
*12:37.980- 12:44.840* :  It was a tough moment. I can never forget it. In agony in hospital she's asking
*12:45.340- 12:50.160* :  why is nobody treating me? The doctor on call had said he wouldn't help protesters who'd
*12:50.160- 12:57.260* :  been shot. Elahe managed to get out of the country but surgeons in Italy couldn't save her right
*12:57.300- 13:03.800* :  eye. The protests were the most serious challenge to Iran's Theocratic regime since the revolution
*13:03.800- 13:11.600* :  of 1979. They lasted for months but were eventually crushed. With hundreds killed thousands
*13:11.600- 13:17.820* :  upon thousands imprisoned and seven protesters executed. But everyday women are still quietly
*13:17.820- 13:22.800* :  defying the regime despite the risks. I've been put in touch with two young women in
*13:22.800- 13:28.300* :  Tehran who are both now going out without the hijab. Understandably they're very very scared to speak
*13:28.300- 13:33.200* :  so we talk on a messaging app and agree to delete the conversation immediately and also to change
*13:33.200- 13:39.140* :  their voices. I've had three warnings for not wearing the hijab. Text warnings because when you're
*13:39.140- 13:45.940* :  driving they record your number plate on CCTV. I dress however I like now but there are still some
*13:45.940- 13:52.100* :  limits like I can't wear a tank top or shorts when I go out. How do you feel when you pass by the
*13:52.100- 13:58.900* :  morality police with your head uncovered? I couldn't have imagined that I could be this brave before
*13:58.900- 14:05.680* :  Masa's death. Even though I feel scared to my bones whenever I pass a morality police I keep my
*14:05.680- 14:15.020* :  head high and I pretend that nothing is happening. A protest last autumn, Mujgen Ilanlu, a 53-year-old
*14:15.020- 14:20.860* :  filmmaker, is unveiled. Since then she's regularly posted pictures of herself without the compulsory
*14:20.860- 14:26.060* :  headscarf and she spent months in jail for publicly criticising Iran's supreme leader.
*14:26.260- 14:33.060* :  What has changed after Masa's death is men's public opinion of women. In the streets, in the metro,
*14:33.060- 14:40.780* :  in Bozar's they prayed women's courage even at family gatherings. A Western diplomat in Tehran
*14:40.780- 14:45.940* :  told me that on the streets of Iran around 20% of women now go out without the hijab.
*14:47.220- 14:52.820* :  The regime is fighting back, preparing a new law to penalise them and making a wave of recent
*14:52.820- 14:58.760* :  arrest to prevent new protests breaking out. But women activists insist that the social revolution
*14:58.760- 15:03.620* :  now underway can't be reversed. Caroline Hawley
*15:04.600- 15:09.060* :  Questions, amountings surrounding the fate of the Chinese defence minister Li Shangfu
*15:09.060- 15:14.000* :  who has not been seen in public for several weeks. The US envoy to Japan,
*15:14.000- 15:19.640* :  Ram Immanuel, has raised concerns about its whereabouts and its growing media speculation that
*15:19.640- 15:25.300* :  Mr. Li could be under house arrest. Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton told me more.
*15:26.080- 15:33.780* :  Well Mr. Li is someone who's really had a pretty seamless career rising smoothly through China's
*15:33.780- 15:40.660* :  military ranks also through the parallel ranks of the party until he became defence minister
*15:40.660- 15:46.740* :  in 2022. That's an important post but the key thing is that he's also a state counsellor and
*15:46.740- 15:53.100* :  there's only five of them in China. They said at the very top of China's elaborate party
*15:53.100- 15:58.900* :  government military structure. So it's a really important post. Now the fact that Mr. Li
*15:58.900- 16:05.460* :  disappeared from view for a few weeks isn't that big a deal but it wasn't until China abruptly
*16:05.460- 16:11.780* :  cancelled a visit Mr. Li was supposed to make to Vietnam without any explanation. That's when
*16:11.780- 16:16.680* :  people really started being concerned and wondering what had happened to him. Now the other
*16:16.680- 16:22.220* :  thing is that the government hasn't really responded to questions about the Shangfu's fate and
*16:22.220- 16:27.580* :  crucially he hasn't been seen in public. Sometimes when questions are raised about a certain
*16:27.580- 16:33.520* :  member of China's government or the party they will quickly resurface in a very public way. Well
*16:33.520- 16:38.580* :  Mr. Li hasn't resurfaced and that's why we're still talking about him now. And this disappearance
*16:38.620- 16:44.660* :  arguably is part of a pattern. That's right this probably sounds a bit familiar because just a
*16:44.660- 16:50.560* :  few months ago we were talking about the abrupt disappearance of another state counsellor and the
*16:50.560- 16:56.560* :  foreign minister teen gang. Now again he had only been in his post for seven months when he abruptly
*16:56.560- 17:02.840* :  disappeared. He has been replaced by his actual predecessor then became his successor Wang Yi
*17:02.840- 17:08.320* :  and we really don't know much about seeing Gong's fate either and so this is all looking very
*17:08.320- 17:15.300* :  fishy for China's leader Xi Jinping because both men are known to be very close to Mr. Xi.
*17:15.300- 17:20.540* :  And if we go back to Li Shangfu the defense minister, Li Shangfu was the head of military
*17:20.540- 17:25.080* :  procurement before he became defense minister and so questions are being raised as to whether
*17:25.080- 17:30.840* :  Xi Jinping the party underneath him has uncovered some corruption that Mr. Li was involved in. Well
*17:30.840- 17:37.100* :  again that doesn't look good for Xi Jinping because this happened when Xi Jinping was in power. This
*17:37.100- 17:40.880* :  really doesn't look good for China's top leader. Celia Hatton
*17:43.280- 17:51.820* :  Still to come in the Global News podcast. It's completely wild. I mean it was at 190,000 which is
*17:51.820- 17:57.980* :  a lot in itself in the last 12 minutes. It just went into this absolute frenzy of bidding.
*17:58.300- 18:04.200* :  The sweater once worn by Princess Diana that sold a auction for a jaw-dropping sum and
*18:04.840- 18:10.060* :  Andrew Peaches here with details of this week's happy pod. Yes this week the story of Moose,
*18:10.060- 18:15.440* :  the dog who saved Sheila and Chris from a fire on their houseboat. They joy me from Texas to tell
*18:15.440- 18:20.260* :  the story which they've also set to music. If you heard about the American cable who fell ill
*18:20.260- 18:25.920* :  thousands of meters below ground in Turkey. Cave rescuers from the whole world join forces
*18:25.920- 18:30.820* :  to work out how to get him out safely. I'll talk to the Croatian man who led the rescue effort
*18:31.280- 18:36.620* :  and if you're swimming 50 kilometers in the sea how the biggest challenge comes from the jellyfish
*18:36.620- 18:41.540* :  I'll talk to John T who took them on a few days ago. He's an amputee by the way.
*18:41.920- 18:46.460* :  Those stories are more in the happy pod available to download in this feed every Saturday.
*18:51.700- 18:56.400* :  The social media app TikTok which is owned by a Chinese company has been
*18:56.400- 19:02.600* :  fined nearly $370 million by the European Union for violating children's privacy.
*19:03.140- 19:08.620* :  An investigation by Ireland's Data Protection Commission found their TikTok accounts were
*19:08.620- 19:14.640* :  visible to all users. Helen Dixon is the head of the Irish-based Data Protection Commission.
*19:15.360- 19:23.180* :  What we discovered is that on registration, child users of those age 13 to 17 and indeed we found
*19:23.180- 19:30.100* :  some under 13 on the platform essentially had the recants defaulted to public and what that meant
*19:30.100- 19:36.280* :  in this case is that then videos that they shared were accessible to anyone. That is precisely
*19:36.300- 19:42.480* :  at the hands of TikTok because of the way they designed the platform and we say therefore
*19:42.480- 19:49.460* :  that that infringed the data protection by design and by default. TikTok said that it disagreed
*19:49.460- 19:54.760* :  with the decision and that it had dealt with most of the issues highlighted. I asked the BBC's
*19:54.760- 20:00.820* :  technology reporter Tom Gurkin how important this fine was. As a business it might be quite
*20:01.180- 20:05.160* :  significant. There's big tech companies that have been fined more. Metters have been fined more
*20:05.160- 20:12.280* :  than a billion dollars. Instagram was fined 400 million but the TikTok this far outstrips any fine
*20:12.280- 20:20.060* :  they faced before in the UK they faced a fine of around 14 million dollars. Obviously that number
*20:20.060- 20:27.760* :  is quite substantially smaller than this which is a whopping 370 million. I appreciate there's
*20:27.760- 20:32.920* :  lots of different numbers big thrown at you there but it does show you that in the context of all
*20:32.920- 20:38.280* :  these fines going around from the Irish data regulator and there are a lot of fines. This one
*20:38.280- 20:43.340* :  might not be the biggest one but it is still far bigger than anything. TikTok has faced so far in
*20:43.340- 20:49.840* :  its history. Yeah but TikTok has what a billion users, 370 million dollars would be a lot of money
*20:49.840- 20:54.500* :  to you and me but is it really going to help? What's it going to mean in practice? In the short term
*20:54.500- 21:00.000* :  perhaps not so much but bear in mind that this is only part one of the investigation from the data
*21:00.000- 21:07.060* :  regulator. It still is looking into TikTok and it's still raising questions on that very same topic
*21:07.060- 21:13.560* :  that meta faced the big fine on. That is the governing of people's data and being taken between
*21:13.560- 21:18.800* :  different jurisdictions. If they've found them guilty of this who knows what will happen with that
*21:18.800- 21:24.500* :  but certainly this could just be part one of an even bigger fine on the horizon. So that will be
*21:24.500- 21:31.360* :  a really big question about TikTok. Tom Gurkin. In 1993 the international community felt
*21:31.360- 21:36.920* :  positive that the Israelis and the Palestinians would by now be living in peace. This came with
*21:36.920- 21:42.000* :  the Oslo Accords which was signed 30 years ago this week and gave the Palestinians hope that
*21:42.000- 21:47.920* :  they would get their own state but these dreams have long since faded as Yoland Nell reports
*21:47.920- 21:53.820* :  from the occupied West Bank. This is the manara roundabout in the heart of Ramallah. The
*21:53.820- 21:59.020* :  fountains are on here. This is an affluent Palestinian city that has become synonymous with the
*21:59.020- 22:04.560* :  Palestinian authority. The interim body that was set up following the signing of the Oslo Accords
*22:04.560- 22:10.700* :  three decades ago. So what do people here in Ramallah think of the situation today? I don't think
*22:10.700- 22:16.140* :  fundamentally the rights and the conditions of Palestinian people have changed. It's been very
*22:16.140- 22:26.000* :  disappointing. Nothing has changed. Things are bad and getting worse. The agreement we will
*22:26.000- 22:33.880* :  sign reflects the decision we made in the Palestine liberation organization to turn a new page in our
*22:33.880- 22:41.700* :  relationship with Israel. Back in 1993 the first of two Oslo Accords was signed on the White House
*22:41.820- 22:46.960* :  Law. Palestinians believed these would soon lead to the creation of their own independent state
*22:46.960- 22:53.080* :  in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with its capital in East Jerusalem. But Oslo is now widely seen
*22:53.080- 22:59.440* :  as a disaster. Says veteran Palestinian pollster, Khalil Shaqqi. 30 years ago two thirds of the
*22:59.440- 23:07.400* :  public was highly optimistic. The support for Oslo was very high. Today the belief that Oslo failed
*23:07.400- 23:13.580* :  is overwhelming. The belief that the twisted solution is no longer viable is also overwhelming.
*23:14.400- 23:18.960* :  All around the edges of Ramallah you see evidence of Israel's continuing grinding military
*23:18.960- 23:24.340* :  occupation of the West Bank. I'm driving now through an Israeli checkpoint. There are settlements
*23:24.340- 23:30.220* :  these have expanded sixfold in the past 30 years. They're seen as illegal under international law
*23:30.540- 23:35.780* :  but Israel disagrees. Nevertheless a former Palestinian authority minister Sabri Saddam
*23:35.780- 23:41.220* :  insists there have been Palestinian gangs from Oslo. The establishment of the different
*23:41.220- 23:48.580* :  institutions, the consolidation of the Palestinian identity, the reinforcement of the law and order
*23:48.580- 23:56.000* :  under the Palestinian authority, the salary payments. It reflects an achievement which Palestinians
*23:56.000- 24:01.420* :  would like to preserve. Here in Ramallah I'm surrounded by Palestinian Authority schools,
*24:01.420- 24:06.260* :  government ministries. The authorities survived the collapse of peace talks with Israel
*24:06.260- 24:12.020* :  and the violence of the second Palestinian uprising. Also the damaging internal split after
*24:12.020- 24:18.180* :  the Islamist militant group Hamas won the last elections in 2006 and went on to take full control
*24:18.180- 24:25.040* :  of Gaza. Many Palestinians now see the authority as corrupt, repressive, Deanna Boutou, a former
*24:25.040- 24:31.420* :  Palestine liberation organization spokeswoman. Questions why it still exists. We're now looking
*24:31.420- 24:37.420* :  at a situation where if you're under the age of 35 you've never voted in any elections for the
*24:37.420- 24:42.420* :  Palestinian Authority. It's the opposite of self-determination and self-government. It's become
*24:42.980- 24:49.620* :  a dictatorship and rule by those who are unelected with no real purpose, no real connection to any
*24:49.620- 24:57.960* :  political process. Another funeral. This has been the bloodiest year in years for Palestinians and
*24:57.960- 25:03.500* :  Israelis in the West Bank. And with a new hard-line government in Israel, the prospects for peace
*25:03.500- 25:10.080* :  look even bleaker. And yet everyone I've met here in Ramallah still dreams of it. It's just that
*25:10.080- 25:15.380* :  with Oslo's failure there's a shortage of new ideas on how to end the decades-old conflict
*25:15.380- 25:23.280* :  and little faith in the Palestinian leadership. Yoland Nell. The former US ambassador to Pakistan and
*25:23.280- 25:29.220* :  the United Arab Emirates has avoided a prison sentence after admitting to criminal charges.
*25:29.740- 25:34.680* :  Richard G. Olson confessed to illicitly lobbying US officials on behalf of the
*25:34.680- 25:41.640* :  Qatari government within a year of leaving office. He also failed to declare an $18,000 first-class
*25:41.640- 25:47.580* :  plane ticket to attend a job interview with a Gulf investment firm in London while he was still
*25:47.580- 25:55.400* :  serving. He's been sentenced to three years probation for each offence and ordered to pay $93,400
*25:55.420- 26:02.920* :  from Washington, his Sean Dilly. Richard Olson was once described by the US Secretary of State as
*26:02.920- 26:08.800* :  quite simply one of our most distinguished diplomats, now though his reputation lies in ruins.
*26:08.800- 26:15.440* :  Prosecutors say the crimes he admitted formed part of a pattern of unethical behavior. Beyond his
*26:15.440- 26:22.700* :  convictions in 2012, Olson started seeing a TV journalist in Islamabad. In 2014,
*26:22.700- 26:29.740* :  they split after she found out he'd been cheating on her and his wife. Months later, he introduced
*26:29.740- 26:37.520* :  her to a Pakistani American businessman who paid $25,000 towards her university fees and arranged
*26:37.520- 26:44.460* :  a further $50,000 loan. While serving as head of Consulate in Dubai, Olson fell to the clear
*26:44.460- 26:50.540* :  60,000 dollars of diamonds delivered to him on behalf of the country's leader, claiming they
*26:50.540- 26:54.160* :  had been a gift for his now late mother-in-law. Sean Dilly
*26:55.140- 27:00.620* :  And if it's sweater, once owned and worn by Princess Diana, has sold it auction in New York for
*27:00.620- 27:06.460* :  more than a million dollars. The red woolen jumper is covered by white sheep with one exception.
*27:06.460- 27:12.100* :  There's also a single black sheep. The auction is Sotheby's had estimated the value
*27:12.480- 27:19.100* :  at $50,000 to $90,000. Friendship bidding meant that this was a record price for an item of clothing
*27:19.100- 27:24.300* :  worn by the British Royal. Joanna Osborne is one of the original designers of the jumper
*27:25.000- 27:30.140* :  and she's been speaking to Tim Franks. There's been a lot of speculations to wear, the original sheep
*27:30.180- 27:35.380* :  jumper that was damaged by Princess Diana where it was and we assumed that we'd lost it in the
*27:35.380- 27:41.160* :  midst of time or accidentally sold it by mistake just because we were some young business desperate
*27:41.160- 27:46.560* :  complete orders. But I was up in the attic looking through 2,000 old patterns for a pattern that
*27:46.560- 27:52.140* :  somebody requested and I just happened to see an old wine box and I opened it and there was this
*27:52.160- 27:57.760* :  rolled up sheep jumper not kept in any kind of special way and then I suddenly had this distant
*27:57.760- 28:03.040* :  memory that actually maybe it was one that Diana had worn. And the reason it had come back to you
*28:03.040- 28:08.040* :  was because as you say and this is a key bit isn't it that it was damaged. It was damaged so she
*28:08.040- 28:13.780* :  wore it for the first time before she was married to Prince Charles and we had no idea she had it.
*28:13.980- 28:20.200* :  We think it was given to her by one of her friends and then Buckingham Palace wrote to us that she
*28:20.200- 28:24.500* :  damaged the jumper and could we either replace it or repair it and of course we immediately
*28:24.500- 28:28.700* :  replaced it and in fact when we sold the jumper yesterday it went with the two lectures and
*28:28.700- 28:34.020* :  Buckingham Palace too. Because that proves that that was the jumper that was worn, this isn't just
*28:34.860- 28:40.040* :  other jumper that's been potentially not. Yes it doesn't prove conclusively we absolutely
*28:40.040- 28:44.600* :  definitely knew and also they were all made individually in those days and all their eyes were
*28:44.600- 28:50.620* :  sewn on to each sheep so depending on the placement of an eye and a particular row of sheep then
*28:50.920- 28:55.040* :  we just knew I mean it was definitely definitely the right one and they also agreed.
*28:55.280- 29:00.320* :  But then my goodness me a million dollars. I know it's bonkers isn't it?
*29:00.560- 29:08.660* :  It's completely wild. I mean it was at 190,000 which is a lot in itself for hours and hours.
*29:08.660- 29:14.060* :  It was in the last 12 minutes that it just went into this absolute frenzy of bidding.
*29:14.320- 29:21.980* :  Not in any way denigrating your obviously very catchy memorable design here but it is just amazing
*29:21.980- 29:29.740* :  that this so Diana memorabilia it really commands such intense interest even now.
*29:29.740- 29:35.960* :  I know but she is even more famous and revered now when she was when she was alive, when she
*29:35.960- 29:40.740* :  wore that jumper she was an important part of your royal family life but now partly because
*29:40.740- 29:45.460* :  she died so young partly because the royal family is constantly evolving partly because she
*29:45.460- 29:49.720* :  made the royal family evolve. People just can't get enough information about it.
*29:50.040- 29:57.160* :  Designer Joanna Osborne. The Colombian painter and sculptor Fernando Batero has died. He was 91
*29:57.300- 30:04.480* :  and his subjects were often retunned people. His objects had epic proportions. Richard Collins has
*30:04.480- 30:09.620* :  this report. While originally training to be a ball fighter Batero took to painting the action
*30:09.620- 30:14.400* :  from the sidelines instead and the travails of the ball ring continued to figure in every decade
*30:14.400- 30:19.860* :  of his work. As did depictions of large ladies and men and larger than life fruit such as apples
*30:19.860- 30:25.460* :  and oranges. One of his most famous works was a copy of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa with a
*30:25.460- 30:30.780* :  puffed up voluminous face. There's something almost comforting about his images that make you feel
*30:30.780- 30:36.000* :  you want to fall into their arms even though they might be convicted criminals. Most of Batero's
*30:36.000- 30:41.140* :  childhood in the 1930s was spent in what was to become half a century later one of Colombia's
*30:41.140- 30:47.340* :  most embattled cities Medellín, famous for the drugs trade and cartel supremo Pablo Escobar.
*30:48.020- 30:52.840* :  He painted Escobar twice but claimed never to have met him but his paintings did circulate
*30:52.840- 30:58.300* :  among cartel leaders, something which helped elevate their price. He came in for some heavy criticism
*30:58.300- 31:03.720* :  when one appeared to show Escobar expertly dodging bullets on a tiled roof. It's still displayed in
*31:03.720- 31:09.100* :  a Medellín gallery and hangs controversially alongside Batero's take on Jesus. Some people
*31:09.100- 31:15.780* :  have criticized me because I did this painting but you know it's not that you admire some boy
*31:15.780- 31:20.860* :  by the fact that you do the painting. You know I always said for instance Al Capone, the American
*31:20.860- 31:26.740* :  did a lot of films and books and things about Al Capone. It doesn't mean that they admire Al Capone
*31:26.740- 31:31.300* :  but you know it was part of the history. His monumental portrait showing the US Army's torture
*31:31.300- 31:36.460* :  of inmates at the Abu Grey Prison in Iraq are his most memorable internationally acclaimed work.
*31:37.100- 31:40.400* :  He produced over 80 of them, some measuring more than four meters high
*31:41.160- 31:45.820* :  and did to exhibit them on former US President George Bush's doorstep at an exhibition
*31:45.820- 31:49.280* :  close to the White House in Washington. In the last five years of his life,
*31:49.280- 31:53.180* :  Fernando Batero entered the elite list of the top ten of the world's most commercially
*31:53.180- 31:58.000* :  successful artists, with bronze sculptures selling for around two million dollars a piece.
*31:58.600- 32:02.420* :  But in his lifetime Batero didn't receive the critical claim he believed he deserved,
*32:02.420- 32:07.400* :  although he did become a national icon in Colombia, was very popular among collectors in Japan
*32:07.400- 32:13.120* :  and mainland Europe and died an extremely wealthy man. Richard Collins, who actually spent a year
*32:13.120- 32:22.440* :  following Fernando Batero around South America. And that's all from us for now, but there'll be
*32:22.440- 32:28.420* :  a new edition of the Global News Podcast at the same time tomorrow. I'm Alex Ritzon until next time.
