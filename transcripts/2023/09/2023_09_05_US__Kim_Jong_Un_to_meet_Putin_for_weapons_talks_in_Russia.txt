01:18.720 - 01:22.760:  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Tuesday the 5th of September these are our main stories
01:22.760 - 01:29.140:  The White House says Kim Jong Un is planning to make a rare trip outside North Korea to hold talks
01:29.140 - 01:35.580:  in Russia with President Putin about military cooperation. The Kremlin has dismissed Turkish plans
01:35.580 - 01:42.440:  to revive a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain via the Black Sea. A major report has found that
01:42.440 - 01:48.400:  invasive species are spreading around the world faster than ever, damaging crops and transmitting
01:48.400 - 01:56.160:  diseases. Also in this podcast. There is a lot of information on the internet and at Google
01:56.160 - 02:00.980:  it's our mission to organize it all and connect you with the information that you actually find
02:00.980 - 02:06.180:  useful. A happy birthday to the world's biggest search engine we look back at a quarter of a
02:06.180 - 02:15.120:  century of googling. Every day Russia is using huge amounts of artillery shells in its bombardment
02:15.120 - 02:20.820:  of Ukraine. It is not a limitless supply however and in recent months Moscow has forged
02:20.820 - 02:26.800:  closer relations with North Korea in the hope of buying more of them. Now Washington says the North
02:26.800 - 02:32.740:  Korean leader Kim Jong Un will travel to Russia to discuss military cooperation. I spoke to
02:32.740 - 02:37.200:  our correspondent in the U.S. Capitol, Gary O'Donough. We're there saying that the arrangements
02:37.200 - 02:42.920:  including possible arms exports are actively advancing and they're talking about a meeting
02:42.920 - 02:47.660:  at some point later this month and Kim Jong Un is expected to travel to Russia for that meeting
02:47.660 - 02:55.760:  possibly to Vladivostok where they last met back in 2019 and this isn't really coming as a particular
02:55.760 - 03:02.040:  surprise because we know that the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shogu he was in Pyongyang back in
03:02.040 - 03:07.660:  July examining military equipment seeing the parades and all that kind of normal thing and of course
03:07.660 - 03:14.760:  previously the Russian state has not actually imported any North Korean munitions but for the
03:14.760 - 03:21.920:  Wagner group under Yevgeny Progoshin did last year and so this is an escalation if you like
03:22.200 - 03:27.780:  and of course Russia has been international shopping for arms elsewhere it's been importing drones
03:27.780 - 03:33.680:  from Iran for example for use on the battlefield and I think some will see this perhaps as a
03:34.260 - 03:40.640:  sign that Russia may be running short of some of its supplies of those sort of key artillery shells
03:41.260 - 03:47.520:  in that battle in eastern Ukraine which is a you know entrenched armies firing larger amounts of
03:47.520 - 03:53.840:  iron at one another. Now would there be anything that the U.S. or the UN could do to prevent any of
03:53.840 - 03:59.520:  this happening? Well there's a whole raft of sanctions and security council resolutions already
03:59.520 - 04:06.000:  in place aimed at preventing North Korea from exporting all this kind of stuff and other things too
04:06.560 - 04:13.000:  bear in mind that is have very little impacts on the way Pyongyang behaves it's continued to develop
04:13.620 - 04:20.040:  its ballistic missile technology it's continued to develop its nuclear capabilities and test those
04:20.480 - 04:26.740:  in various ways in the the seas off the coast and between there in Japan so you know that kind
04:26.740 - 04:32.480:  of action I'm sure will be pursued by the U.S. but it's not clear how much impact it will have
04:32.480 - 04:38.360:  and of course if they can do these deals with Vladimir Putin's Russia it will bring in some very
04:38.360 - 04:43.580:  important foreign currency and while banking sanctions and financial sanctions are part of the
04:43.580 - 04:49.760:  whole sort of panoply of things in place that people find ways around these things and if they
04:49.760 - 04:54.980:  have more money to spend then they won't be able to flex their muscles even more as a regional power.
04:55.540 - 05:01.680:  Gary O'Donohue in Washington. It was the first meeting of the Russian and Turkish leaders in
05:01.680 - 05:06.980:  nearly a year and the talks between Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan dealt with amongst
05:06.980 - 05:13.020:  other things the safe passage of commercial shipping through the Black Sea. Ukraine has increasingly
05:13.020 - 05:18.360:  used the Danube as an alternative export route but in the last few days Russia has attacked
05:18.360 - 05:23.700:  Ukrainian port facilities on that river and President Putin insisted that Western restrictions on
05:23.700 - 05:29.720:  Russian agricultural exports had to be lifted before a deal could be done but he did offer
05:29.720 - 05:37.200:  some help to six importing countries in Africa. We are close to completing an agreement with
05:37.200 - 05:42.780:  six African states to which we intend to supply food for free and even carry out delivery and
05:42.780 - 05:49.480:  logistics for free to deliver this cargo. Negotiations are almost close to completion. Delivery
05:49.480 - 05:54.780:  will begin in the next two to three weeks. So just how important is it to those countries who
05:54.780 - 06:00.600:  rely on Ukrainian grain? That a deal is struck. I heard more from our international business correspondent
06:00.600 - 06:07.360:  Theo Legert. You have to break this down. In global terms the deal is no longer as important as
06:07.360 - 06:13.580:  it might once have been. If we look at what happened to grain prices in the immediate aftermath
06:13.580 - 06:20.440:  of Russia's invasion of Ukraine they spiked and spiked dramatically so for example we saw
06:20.440 - 06:26.080:  the price of wheat spiked to about twelve dollars a bushel and when the Black Sea grain initiative
06:26.080 - 06:33.160:  was first brought in we then saw prices fall to about eight dollars a bushel. Well now despite
06:33.160 - 06:39.620:  the fact that over the summer the grain initiative was suspended prices are even lower than that
06:39.620 - 06:44.880:  grain is currently trading on global markets at about five dollars seventy a bushel. But there
06:44.880 - 06:49.160:  is plenty of grain out there so we're not saying anything like the kind of spikes we used to see
06:49.900 - 06:56.560:  where this is a problem is in the countries that were particularly dependent on imports of grain
06:56.560 - 07:04.260:  from both Ukraine and Russia. So we're talking countries like Egypt and Somalia and we know that
07:04.340 - 07:10.920:  the febrile nature of those imports over the past year the the disruption to them has already had
07:10.920 - 07:17.740:  a big effect. So in Egypt for example inflation of over 35 percent well a great deal of that is due
07:17.740 - 07:23.520:  to the cost of food imports. Somalia there are severe problems there as well and in Ethiopia we're
07:23.520 - 07:29.000:  seeing food price inflation and it's in those regions where if the initiative is not restored
07:29.000 - 07:35.560:  it will contribute to the current situation where food prices and food availability have been
07:35.560 - 07:40.700:  under pressure. And Theo it is very hard to find new suppliers quickly at a good price. So what are
07:40.700 - 07:45.580:  some of these countries you've been talking about doing to cope with a shortfall? Well those countries
07:45.580 - 07:52.540:  in Africa which are growers of grain have been increasing their output so Zimbabwe for example
07:53.180 - 08:00.060:  otherwise it's a question of finding alternative suppliers. Now as you mentioned Russia has said
08:00.060 - 08:07.040:  that it's prepared to send free supplies of grain to a number of African countries but that does
08:07.040 - 08:12.180:  seem to depend on progress being made on the Black Sea initiative in itself. So the question is
08:12.180 - 08:17.080:  if you don't get supplies from these regions you have to get them from elsewhere. Now in terms of
08:17.080 - 08:22.940:  Ukraine sending its grain Ukraine is still exporting grain just not through the Black Sea it's
08:22.940 - 08:28.160:  exporting it through Poland and Romania. The question then becomes can those supplies find an
08:28.160 - 08:33.920:  alternative route into markets and North and East Africa and all of this stuff it makes it more
08:33.920 - 08:38.900:  difficult and it pushes up costs and that feeds into the situation we're seeing wherein
08:39.380 - 08:43.620:  lower income countries that are dependent on imports or that have a high level of imports
08:44.160 - 08:50.080:  prices are spiking the cost of basic life, basic food has been going out. Theo Legert.
08:50.820 - 08:56.580:  There have been more anti-government protests in southern Syria a variety of unverified videos
08:56.580 - 09:03.540:  from the province of Suweda show chanting demonstrators calling on President Basha Alassad to step down.
09:03.540 - 09:09.240:  Here's Mike Thompson. Anti-government protests outside of opposition controlled areas have been
09:09.240 - 09:15.600:  very rare in Syria but these demonstrations in the Drew's majority Suweda province are now
09:15.600 - 09:22.280:  entering their third week. Unverified videos show demonstrators calling on President Basha Alassad
09:22.280 - 09:28.540:  to go. Others feature demonstrators clapping and dancing to protest songs and carrying banners
09:28.540 - 09:35.060:  mocking the country to leader. State media have so far ignored the protests but with others breaking
09:35.060 - 09:42.500:  out elsewhere in Syria that could soon change. So-called invasive alien species are living
09:42.500 - 09:47.740:  things transported around the globe by humans into places they wouldn't naturally be and that
09:47.740 - 09:54.480:  is proving to be a huge problem both ecologically and financially. A couple of prominent examples for
09:54.480 - 10:01.500:  you the Florida Everglades are now overrun by five meter long Burmese pifons devastating local
10:01.500 - 10:08.340:  animals and the wildfires that hit Hawaii last month were partly fueled by invasive grasses
10:09.040 - 10:14.060:  which had spread across the island of Maui. According to a new report invasive species are the
10:14.060 - 10:21.820:  only cause or one of a number of causes of 60 percent of extensions of animals or plants so far
10:21.820 - 10:27.100:  reported and the problem is expected to get even worse. The economic costs are rising too
10:27.100 - 10:34.980:  quadrupling every decade reaching 423 billion dollars in 2019. Helen Briggs is our science
10:34.980 - 10:41.860:  correspondent. If you think about what's happening we're moving animals and plants around the world
10:42.580 - 10:48.080:  and then if you take them out of a place where they've naturally evolved to be in a particular
10:48.080 - 10:52.980:  ecosystem along with other plants and animals and there's a fragile balance if you put them somewhere
10:52.980 - 10:59.600:  else then they're going to be a risk to other species that are living there already. So one
10:59.600 - 11:06.220:  example the Asian Hornet that's spreading around the world if you put that into a different ecosystem
11:06.220 - 11:12.780:  with other insects which aren't used to that predator then it can do a lot of damage. So some quite
11:12.780 - 11:19.240:  stark figures and in fact is even higher on some islands where you've got species that have evolved
11:19.240 - 11:25.160:  in isolation for years and years and years and then if you accidentally bring in a plant or an
11:25.160 - 11:30.740:  animal then it can do incredible damage and they are saying that if we just carry on the way we are
11:30.740 - 11:36.440:  business as usual then it's going to get even worse and added to that cost have been quadrupling
11:36.440 - 11:43.100:  every decade since 1970 in terms of dealing with global plant and animal invasions if you like
11:43.100 - 11:51.560:  more than 400 billion US dollars a year so that really again underlines the importance of dealing
11:51.560 - 11:57.060:  with the problem but there are things you can do this again this report is highlighting prevention
11:57.160 - 12:02.860:  so it's things like having border controls in place but this can be done at an individual level
12:02.860 - 12:09.740:  as well according to one of the authors of the report Professor Helen Roy. We need everyone to be
12:09.740 - 12:15.440:  more joined up around the world in tackling this huge huge problem but we also know that individuals
12:15.440 - 12:21.220:  can also make a huge difference they can be responsible gardeners responsible pet owners and so
12:21.220 - 12:26.100:  that they can themselves play a part in preventing the movement of invasive alien species around the
12:26.100 - 12:32.580:  world or within their locality. One of the things again highlighted in this major global report
12:32.580 - 12:38.720:  into invasive species is the fact that nearly 200 countries have signed up to new targets on
12:38.720 - 12:43.980:  stopping biodiversity loss and there's some very stringent targets by 2030 one of them is
12:43.980 - 12:48.940:  around alien species and it perhaps hasn't got as much attention to some of the others but that is to
12:48.940 - 12:57.400:  reduce introduction and establishment of alien species by at least 50% by 2030 so that underscores
12:57.400 - 13:05.460:  the urgency of action to combat invasive alien species. Helen Briggs staying with the issue of
13:05.460 - 13:11.460:  invasive alien species in 14 states in the US people are being asked to stomp it in other words
13:11.460 - 13:19.800:  kill it this refers to the spotted lanternfly. James Reynolds spoke to Julie Urban and evolutionary
13:19.800 - 13:25.560:  biologist at Penn State University who's currently in upstate New York so how did the spotted
13:25.560 - 13:31.880:  lanternflies become an invasive species? In the case of the spotted lanternfly its native range
13:31.920 - 13:38.260:  is Asia biggest area there is China and it got uprooted and transported here by accident.
13:38.840 - 13:43.780:  What does it look like when the lanternfly gets stuck in and how where do you?
13:44.500 - 13:49.420:  I'm very worried that lanternfly is a sap feeding insect and so the closest relative that people
13:49.420 - 13:55.080:  are familiar with are cicadas but this is an unusual insect it feeds on over 100 different species
13:55.080 - 14:01.540:  of plants and so that feeding on sap can be problematic but that feeding when it's prolonged
14:01.580 - 14:07.220:  can cause damage and mortality to grapefines but also because it feeds on so many different things
14:07.220 - 14:11.900:  it doesn't just stay in vineyards it moves around to different habitats so people are finding it
14:11.900 - 14:16.420:  feeding on their trees in New York City. Gosh and when you say a little earlier it arrives
14:16.420 - 14:20.700:  accidentally is that in what accidentally people's backpacks if they've been around the world traveling
14:20.700 - 14:24.900:  how does it get in? It can come in a lot of different ways that hence the stomping campaign but
14:24.920 - 14:30.980:  we're pretty sure from where it was first detected it was transported as an egg mass on a shipment
14:30.980 - 14:36.000:  of stone either on the pallet of the stone itself that arrived at a landscaping company in
14:36.000 - 14:42.160:  eastern Pennsylvania in 2014. Wow that's incredibly accurate to know that and then you've mentioned
14:42.160 - 14:47.800:  the stomping campaign is that literally stomping I would the soul of your foot getting rid of
14:47.800 - 14:52.920:  lantern flies that way. Your foot your hand whatever will do it but that's that's not the only
14:52.920 - 14:57.600:  control effort I mean we have government agencies USDA APHIS and State Department of Agriculture
14:58.280 - 15:04.480:  for applying insecticides at transportation hubs you know areas around airports around rail
15:04.480 - 15:10.100:  ones you know where this thing can get into cargo and so there's actually control efforts that way
15:10.100 - 15:15.240:  but it's such a good hitchhiker that we want people to be aware of it and so if you don't kill it
15:15.240 - 15:20.360:  you'll carry it is is the idea behind the stomping campaign. Do you actually take part in the stomping
15:20.360 - 15:25.380:  campaign yourself if you see lantern flies? I do a lot of dissection of the insects so I'm more
15:25.380 - 15:34.420:  likely to put them in a vial and make a trouble for my husband. Yes and some people don't mind bugs
15:34.980 - 15:39.180:  other people do mind I'm in two minds I was at a bug museum over the weekend on holiday which
15:39.180 - 15:43.760:  was strangely absorbing much more absorbing and looking at cockroaches than I thought it would
15:43.760 - 15:50.540:  ever be can you explain why for some people bugs invasive species like lantern flies people want
15:50.540 - 15:55.500:  to run a hundred miles before they might want to deal with them or even stomp them out and help you.
15:55.780 - 16:00.440:  Yes well this insects really problematic as adults they're about an inch long and they can feed
16:00.440 - 16:06.140:  by the hundreds or even thousands on a single tree and so that kind of freaks people out right
16:06.140 - 16:10.720:  there to have such high numbers of a large insect but also because they feed on plant sap they
16:10.720 - 16:17.080:  excrete sugary excrement we call honeydew and bees and wasps and stinging insects are attracted to
16:17.080 - 16:22.100:  it so if they're in your backyard or you know on the street near you they're a nuisance factor for
16:22.100 - 16:28.200:  those other reasons as well. Julie Urban an evolutionary biologist at Penn State University.
16:29.780 - 16:34.740:  At the start of the 1990s if you'd looked in a dictionary you'd have found the word Google
16:34.860 - 16:42.620:  which means 10 to the power of 100 or a very large number indeed the word Google with its change
16:42.620 - 16:49.640:  of spelling did not exist now you'd find the word by googling it of course as the search engine
16:49.640 - 16:56.420:  celebrates its 25th birthday and the sly looks back at its life. 25 years ago and the world looked
16:56.420 - 17:01.000:  a little different the web had only been around since the start of the decade and if you wanted to
17:01.000 - 17:05.680:  look something up you may well have reached for a dictionary or an encyclopedia rather than
17:05.680 - 17:11.600:  search for it on the internet 1998 was the year that France won the world cup Bill Clinton was
17:11.600 - 17:17.420:  president of the United States share topped the charts with her single believe and on the 4th
17:17.420 - 17:23.920:  of September at Stanford University in California Google was born. There is a lot of information on
17:23.920 - 17:28.660:  the internet and at Google it's our mission to organize it all and connect you with the information
17:28.660 - 17:32.700:  that you actually find useful. I wish everyone could navigate this place a little better.
17:33.280 - 17:38.480:  It's easy just tell them to search before they share with Google. Google it and you'll find
17:38.480 - 17:43.380:  that the search engine was initially known as Backrub before the name Google was chosen by its
17:43.380 - 17:50.080:  founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The paramet at Stanford University both PhD students in
17:50.080 - 17:56.520:  computer science. Search engines such as Yahoo and Ask Jeaves did already exist but Google's
17:56.520 - 18:01.540:  approach was slightly different. Wendy Hall is a professor of computer science at the University
18:01.540 - 18:06.900:  of Southampton. Every time you click on a link with Google you are effectively recommending that
18:06.900 - 18:12.580:  that's the link you're following Google uses that to prioritize the link so every time we use
18:12.640 - 18:18.700:  Google we help it refine its searches and partly because they were the first to really develop the
18:18.700 - 18:23.080:  business model which it all runs on these days which is advertising so they effectively sell
18:23.140 - 18:30.840:  words so there's auctions for the keywords and companies pay to be the the top word on tennis
18:30.840 - 18:36.420:  or whatever and that's their business model and the network effect means that once you've got
18:36.420 - 18:41.320:  billions of people using it which they have it's very difficult for another company to come along
18:41.320 - 18:46.480:  and shift those billions to using their search engine. As well as dominating the search engine
18:46.480 - 18:53.180:  market Google has other products such as phones and Google Maps. It also owns YouTube. In the 12
18:53.180 - 19:00.200:  months to June the revenue of its parent company Alphabet was $290 billion. The development of AI and
19:00.200 - 19:06.100:  competitors such as ChatGPT could have posed a threat but happily for Google when ChatGPT was
19:06.100 - 19:12.920:  released in November 2022 it was already developing its own alternative. Meet Bard, an early experiment
19:12.920 - 19:18.600:  by Google that lets you collaborate with Generative AI. Bard, Google's conversational
19:18.600 - 19:25.220:  Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbot available in 46 languages in 238 countries and maybe
19:25.220 - 19:32.100:  one day integrated into its search engine. Ellen is Sly and today Alphabet the parent company of
19:32.100 - 19:41.720:  Google has a market value of $1.7 trillion. Still to come. The Moon's dark half of a month so
19:41.720 - 19:48.120:  we can't rely on solar energy. So what's the alternative and the possible answer to living on the Moon?
19:55.640 - 19:59.600:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
19:59.760 - 20:05.520:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
20:05.520 - 20:09.960:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
20:10.080 - 20:15.320:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims or what Jeff Bezos really
20:15.320 - 20:20.960:  did to become the first person in history to pocket $100 billion. Listen to Good Bad Billionaire
20:20.960 - 20:25.280:  with me Simon Jack. And me Zingsing, available now wherever you get your podcasts.
20:29.740 - 20:34.140:  Unexpected Elements is the podcast that sifts through the week's news to unearth
20:34.160 - 20:38.960:  surprising nuggets of science. I really wanted to look at an animal that as far as we could tell
20:38.960 - 20:44.460:  at least doesn't seem to age. Okay you have my attention tell me more. And uncover the unexpected
20:44.460 - 20:50.520:  connections between them. I think now it's expected to cover our worst. Really? Worms? Absolutely.
20:51.180 - 20:57.920:  Unexpected Elements from the BBC World Service. Amazing stuff. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
20:59.480 - 21:04.660:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The University of Amsterdam student association
21:04.800 - 21:11.140:  has suspended one of its fraternities indefinitely as it investigates allegations that a group of
21:11.140 - 21:17.540:  first-year students engaged in serious abuse. The activity is known as hazing were part of an
21:17.540 - 21:23.960:  initiation ritual that took place during a trip to Romania by the university's Aras student branch.
21:24.840 - 21:28.020:  The BBC s Anahologan in the Netherlands told James Reynolds more.
21:28.980 - 21:32.640:  Well this story should come with a bit of a health warning I think because there are some
21:32.640 - 21:40.980:  details that some people might find triggering. So there was a list of 80 tasks in this assignment,
21:41.120 - 21:45.700:  this hazing assignment. So it's an initiation if people wanted to join this fraternity
21:45.700 - 21:51.220:  Aras they had to earn points by completing these tasks and some of them were hugely degrading.
21:51.300 - 21:58.280:  So for example one of them was have sex with an inverted commas a bucket in an alleyway bucket
21:58.280 - 22:05.040:  referring to a woman have a date have sex with a refugee visit a strip club and steal something
22:05.420 - 22:10.260:  and all of these activities should be filmed by the students these are freshers we're talking about
22:10.260 - 22:16.800:  so people 18-19 years old on this trip to Romania possibly away from home for the first time
22:17.120 - 22:21.500:  being asked to complete these tasks in order to join the student association one of the most
22:21.500 - 22:26.260:  prestigious one thousand one hundred members so the second largest in Amsterdam and they were
22:26.560 - 22:30.960:  told they weren't allowed to go on social media during that time and it all came out because the
22:31.180 - 22:37.300:  the letter the list was leaked to the phone Amsterdam which is a weekly publication in Amsterdam is
22:37.720 - 22:42.140:  it's caused some ruckians which have gone right the way up to the top today.
22:42.420 - 22:46.700:  They've been suspended by the Dutch student unions I'm wondering if the authorities in Romania
22:46.700 - 22:52.140:  themselves have been investigating exactly what happened in case any of those activities broke the
22:52.140 - 22:58.520:  law in Romania. I mean that's a really interesting question actually I mean I suppose having sex
22:58.520 - 23:03.740:  with someone in an alleyway may or may not break Romanian law politicians here have had plenty to
23:03.740 - 23:09.240:  say so the mayor of Amsterdam Femke Hallsma said the details were shocking the minister for education
23:09.240 - 23:13.640:  said that something needed to change but you know James the worrying thing is that this is not the
23:13.640 - 23:18.780:  first time there have been cases in the past where serious abuses have occurred abuses of power
23:19.100 - 23:24.680:  because these organizations are extremely influential students want to join their scene as I
23:24.680 - 23:28.080:  don't know what you were doing in your student days but you want to have a strong group of friends
23:28.080 - 23:32.860:  you're out there by yourself and these fraternities are meant to offer that kind of family away from
23:32.860 - 23:39.100:  home and in this case they've used that power to manipulate vulnerable students and it's not
23:39.100 - 23:45.360:  actually known whether any of the students completed any of these tasks but the organization the
23:45.360 - 23:50.680:  universities and other educational institutions have asked that anyone who was affected to come
23:50.680 - 23:55.900:  forward for help and support and probably to help with the investigation which is now underway and
23:55.900 - 24:03.640:  we should say ours the fraternity have apologized they said in this case we crossed the line and
24:03.640 - 24:10.320:  are all again in the Netherlands police in Pakistan say a Christian priest has been shot and wounded
24:10.320 - 24:16.160:  in the same town in the eastern Punjab province two weeks ago vigilante has attacked churches
24:16.160 - 24:21.860:  and burnt down Christian homes paramilitary troops have been deployed in Jaramwala since last
24:21.860 - 24:28.280:  month's violence to restore calm Lippaker Pellum has more details the 35-year-old Protestant priest
24:28.280 - 24:33.900:  Elias Arsantu had been stopped by a gunman on his way home after conducting this under service
24:34.620 - 24:39.660:  he'd been asked to recite the Islamic Proclamation of Faith but when he replied with a Christian prayer
24:39.660 - 24:45.000:  he was shot social media footage appears to show the priest with a large wound on his shoulder
24:45.000 - 24:50.560:  being treated in hospital Muslim vigilantes attacked and set fire to around two dozen churches
24:50.960 - 24:55.660:  and scores of Christian homes last month in the eastern district over blasphemy allegations
24:55.660 - 25:02.660:  Christians make up about 1.3% of Pakistan's population of 200 million Lippaker Pellum
25:03.560 - 25:08.640:  the British foreign office has formally apologized to an academic who was imprisoned and tortured
25:08.640 - 25:15.120:  in the United Arab Emirates after he was wrongly accused of being a spy Matthew Hedges was
25:15.120 - 25:20.860:  carrying out research in the Gulf State in 2018 when he was arrested and held for six months
25:20.860 - 25:26.460:  last month a parliamentary watchdog ruled that the government had failed to follow its own guidance
25:26.460 - 25:33.240:  on detecting potential torture and mistreatment of British nationals abroad Caroline Hawley reports
25:34.000 - 25:39.360:  Matthew Hedges says he was interrogated for between eight and fifteen hours a day kept in solitary
25:39.360 - 25:45.900:  confinement and forcibly medicated the UAE is a British ally and a consulate official was able
25:45.900 - 25:50.040:  to visit him the Mr Hedges says his guards were always present at those meetings
25:50.620 - 25:54.260:  making it impossible for him to talk openly about his mistreatment
25:55.160 - 25:59.540:  last month the parliamentary ombudsman said he'd endured a nightmare and found that the government
25:59.540 - 26:05.380:  failed to notice signs of torture and failed to intervene the foreign office has now apologized
26:05.380 - 26:11.160:  and agreed to pay nominal compensation of 1,500 pounds as recommended by the ombudsman
26:11.980 - 26:16.360:  it's also promised to review its internal guidance on cases of torture and mistreatment
26:17.020 - 26:22.740:  Mr Hedges who's now 35 welcomed the apology but said that achieving it had been a long battle
26:23.460 - 26:30.620:  Caroline Hawley a major issue for space scientists is how to provide energy for astronauts wanting
26:30.620 - 26:36.060:  to stay for long periods on the moon or other planets while the problem may have been resolved
26:36.060 - 26:41.760:  according to researchers at Banger University here in the UK John Donnison has the details
26:43.200 - 26:50.020:  the moon continues to mystify India the latest country to launch a lunar mission earlier this summer
26:51.200 - 26:57.400:  but while it successfully landed an unmanned module NASA has said it wants to set up a permanent
26:57.400 - 27:02.280:  manned base on the moon by 2030 but to do that you need power
27:02.700 - 27:07.920:  we'll use the 10 gram samples now scientists at the University of Banger say they've developed small
27:07.920 - 27:15.300:  nuclear fuel cells stable enough to be transported into space the moon's dark half of a month
27:15.300 - 27:20.300:  so we can't rely on solar energy we can't rely on solar PV and things like that although
27:20.800 - 27:24.500:  I imagine they'll be part of the mix but we also need to have that thing for when it's dark
27:24.500 - 27:30.140:  to have electricity and energy generation there when it's dark so that's when nuclear comes in
27:30.520 - 27:36.400:  more tests are needed but the hope is Banger's fuel cells could power micro-nuclear generators
27:36.400 - 27:42.700:  currently being developed by Rolls Royce and the real prize is Mars with some believing that
27:42.700 - 27:48.040:  establishing a manned base on the moon could provide a gateway to the red planet
27:48.740 - 27:53.620:  John Donnison many children around the world will be returning to school this week after the
27:53.620 - 28:00.300:  holiday season amongst those is 70-year-old Caitlin Hudson as she returns this term in Britain she
28:00.300 - 28:05.860:  will be equipped with a bionic arm the youngest person to be fitted with such a device in the UK
28:06.560 - 28:11.340:  Caitlin was born with only one fully formed hand because of a rare congenital condition
28:11.880 - 28:17.340:  but after a GoFundMe money-raising campaign she's been fitted with a life-changing device
28:18.020 - 28:23.840:  Evan Davis spoke to Caitlin and her mum Maria Caitlin was born and with a condition so-called
28:23.840 - 28:30.400:  Simbrachodactyl which basically means she is missing part of her left forearm and part of her
28:30.440 - 28:34.580:  hand she does have something that's called nubbind which are tiny little fingers but they don't
28:34.580 - 28:39.400:  have any bones in them she doesn't really have any bones in her hand she she does have flexion
28:39.400 - 28:44.600:  in her wrist which is quite unusual but very useful for a hero arm but it does mean that she
28:44.600 - 28:49.080:  doesn't have a pincer grip or anything like that so having a hero arm is giving the her the
28:49.080 - 28:54.260:  ability to have that pincer grip hold things to open and close her hand which she can't do at the
28:54.260 - 28:59.360:  moment and there is no not really any other prosthetics that replicate those sort of movements
28:59.640 - 29:05.860:  all right so Caitlin when did you get this this bionic arm this hero arm two weeks ago today
29:05.860 - 29:12.020:  two weeks ago today yeah and how is it how how's it working good yeah makes a difference
29:12.420 - 29:14.300:  all sorts of things you're doing with it now create them
29:14.660 - 29:20.500:  I've been doing with it hold and eat my other hand yeah so we're not making a mess that
29:20.500 - 29:25.180:  sometimes you do you can hold cutlery with it what other things you can do
29:26.780 - 29:31.680:  brush your hair bit more easily brush your hair we're gonna try we're gonna try brushing your
29:31.680 - 29:37.660:  hair and drying it soon and we're gonna have a go at holding paper with it and cutting with
29:37.660 - 29:41.240:  your right hand because we've had a few inches where we've had clothes that have been cut
29:42.280 - 29:49.100:  so Caitlin is it is it difficult to use I can't imagine how how easy it is to use this this
29:49.100 - 29:56.180:  hero arm you find it easy or hard to use Caitlin yeah what do you have to do with your little hand
29:56.180 - 30:02.480:  to get it to work you move your wrist side to side don't you and then your hand opens or closes
30:02.480 - 30:06.920:  and does other bits and pieces doesn't it because you've got the wrist it makes it quite easy
30:06.920 - 30:12.100:  for you to use it just gets a bit tiring sometimes doesn't it do you get tired Caitlin does it get
30:12.100 - 30:19.700:  is it heavy yeah but the more you use it the easier it becomes isn't it Maria tell us about
30:19.700 - 30:24.060:  how you got it because this wasn't handed to you by the NHS was it you had to make a bit of
30:24.060 - 30:29.200:  a bit of an effort in fact normally you'd be a little bit older to before open bionics would give
30:29.200 - 30:33.960:  you one of these arms so generally they've said eight years old for one of these heroes I was
30:33.960 - 30:38.140:  partly because of the size of it children need to be fairly well developed both mentally and
30:38.140 - 30:42.280:  physically to be able to use this but as I mentioned Caitlin's got this slightly longer arm with
30:42.280 - 30:47.300:  the wrist which makes her that she can use it fairly well to be honest but last November time
30:47.300 - 30:52.400:  when she was about six and a half I contacted open my onyx and put a name down because I wasn't sure
30:52.400 - 30:57.480:  how long the process was going to take within about a week or so we were having an online meeting
30:57.480 - 31:01.840:  of open bionics and they said yes she looks like she could be a perspective candidate for this
31:01.980 - 31:06.040:  and she'd had some assessments and said yep she's perfect one of these arms she needs to do a
31:06.040 - 31:10.880:  little bit more growing and obviously we also had to raise the funds for the arm so the arm cost
31:11.020 - 31:16.400:  the actual arm cost 13 and a half thousand pounds and we've been incredibly lucky we've been
31:16.400 - 31:20.580:  able to raise this through our GoFundMe page which we are going to carry on running because
31:20.960 - 31:25.200:  there are ongoing maintenance costs and such look for it so we've done it through donations
31:25.420 - 31:30.060:  some grants people have raised money through cake sales Caitlin's score have been incredibly
31:30.060 - 31:34.540:  supportive they've had a superhero day wouldn't be able to do if it wasn't for the support of so
31:34.540 - 31:38.620:  many people people that we know but also a lot of people we don't know so we're really really
31:38.620 - 31:42.620:  grateful for the support we've had and we just want to say a huge thank you that you've done some
31:42.620 - 31:47.380:  that's totally going to change Caitlin's life we raised the 13 and a half thousand pounds for the arm
31:47.420 - 31:51.580:  and we've so I've got an additional five thousand pounds which has meant that we can put an
31:51.580 - 31:57.240:  extended warranty on this arm right so that she's got as it stands at the moment five years worth
31:57.240 - 32:02.320:  of growing so to speak so we can pay for that for for five years and we've also got some money
32:02.320 - 32:07.840:  we're going to say things like covers and things at some point obviously Caitlin's still growing
32:07.840 - 32:13.520:  at some point presumably she doesn't have to change change arm yeah so we're not quite sure how
32:13.520 - 32:17.120:  quickly that will come that's the one of the downsides of being one of the youngest children
32:17.180 - 32:22.000:  to have one she's got more growing to do I think initially we can have it just tweaked but at some
32:22.000 - 32:27.000:  point in the next few years she will have to have a full recast and a full armory done and obviously
32:27.000 - 32:34.740:  that's going to come at a price Maria the mother of Caitlin Hudson and that's all from us for now
32:34.760 - 32:39.020:  but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast later just before we go though
