01:04.520 - 01:07.860:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:10.800 - 01:17.380:  I'm Garas Barlow and at 1300 GMT on Thursday 7th September, these are our main stories.
01:18.140 - 01:23.100:  In Japan, the sex abuse scandal engulfing the talent agency behind the country's biggest
01:23.100 - 01:28.220:  boy bands has led to the resignation of its boss. The house did president of Caban,
01:28.220 - 01:33.980:  Ali Bongo has been released from house arrest. And Australia's leader is to visit China this year
01:34.300 - 01:42.120:  in the latest sign of thoring relations. Also in this podcast in Mexico, women's rights are
01:42.120 - 01:48.840:  topping the agenda in both politics and the Supreme Court. Plus, Ahmed wasn't just the star pupil.
01:48.840 - 01:55.060:  He was standing in as a teacher in a classroom with no windows and no desks.
01:55.320 - 02:00.380:  But despite years of civil war in Yemen, there's a story of hope and of change.
02:04.120 - 02:09.420:  The Japanese entertainment industry has been rocked by allegations of sexual abuse by the late
02:09.420 - 02:15.440:  Johnny Kittagawa, the founder of the country's most influential talent agency, Johnny and associates.
02:15.440 - 02:21.260:  He was accused publicly for some decades of abusing aspiring young male pop stars from
02:21.260 - 02:28.540:  his far back as the 1950s. He died in 2019, but now for the first time, the current CEO of the agency,
02:28.540 - 02:34.180:  Julie Fujishima, whose Johnny's niece has admitted that the sexual abuse happened and has resigned.
02:34.780 - 02:36.240:  She appeared at a news conference.
02:41.720 - 02:48.100:  The agency itself and I myself as a person recognized that sex abuse by Johnny Kittagawa took
02:48.100 - 02:54.360:  place. I apologize to his victims from the bottom of my heart. I apologize to all the fans,
02:54.380 - 02:58.280:  business stakeholders, and everyone concerned about this issue.
02:58.620 - 03:00.980:  Our Tokyo correspondent Shoma Kaliw has the details.
03:01.680 - 03:05.900:  This is a very significant moment for Japan, especially its entertainment industry, because
03:06.660 - 03:12.320:  I mean, for all intents and purposes, Kittagawa was a starmaker. He was a talent manager,
03:12.320 - 03:18.280:  but essentially he was the overriding figure in the entertainment industry. If you are a young
03:18.280 - 03:26.680:  teenager wanting to make a name for yourself, his agency was your gateway. And for decades,
03:26.680 - 03:33.580:  these accusations that he sexually abused aspiring pop stars, male pop stars that came through
03:33.580 - 03:38.540:  his agency, had marred his career. There were some that actually were proven in civil court,
03:38.540 - 03:44.760:  but he was never charged. Now, these allegations resurfaced in a BBC documentary earlier this year
03:44.760 - 03:49.420:  in March. Victims spoke to the BBC about their experiences, and it became clearer as well
03:49.420 - 03:56.560:  that his clout, his power had discouraged people from coming forward, had stifled reporting on
03:56.560 - 04:02.500:  this because his agency dealt with many of the channels that featured his talents, or the talents
04:02.500 - 04:10.380:  that his agency essentially was responsible for. But pressure grew. The fans expressed a huge deal
04:10.380 - 04:15.880:  of anger after the documentary. And last week, an investigation found that he had repeatedly
04:15.880 - 04:23.080:  abused boys, you know, for decades from the 1950s all the way beyond 2010. And the fact that this
04:23.080 - 04:28.940:  is a family business, a family management of it allowed this atmosphere to continue. And today,
04:28.940 - 04:36.540:  for the first time, Julie Fujishima stood in front of a room full of journalists with victims
04:36.540 - 04:43.260:  watching in another place, bowed her head and said that she was sorry. She apologized to the
04:43.260 - 04:50.400:  fans and to the victims and stepped down as CEO. So he has died back in 2019. These allegations
04:50.540 - 04:55.840:  had been around for some time. They've now been accepted and acknowledged by his niece.
04:56.140 - 05:02.480:  What happens now? Nuryuki Higashiyama, who is a household name here in Japan, an entertainer,
05:02.480 - 05:07.840:  a veteran TV personality. He's actually one of the first talents that was recruited by the agency.
05:07.840 - 05:13.640:  He's now been appointed as the successor, as the new CEO. They've promised the structural change.
05:13.640 - 05:17.640:  They've promised that things are going to be different. How it will change and what that will
05:17.640 - 05:22.300:  look like, we don't know. But I think it begs the question of will more people come forward? Will
05:22.300 - 05:26.420:  they be emboldened now that this is out in the public and being reported on? And I think the
05:26.420 - 05:32.060:  bigger question is, what is the future of this brand that has been equivalent to entertainment,
05:32.060 - 05:36.460:  to glamour, to fame, and that has now been very publicly disgraced?
05:36.980 - 05:42.720:  Shima Kaleo, on Wednesday night, the coup leaders in Gabon took to state television to announce
05:42.720 - 05:48.540:  that they would release the man they overthrew. They said President Ali Bongo was unwell and was
05:48.540 - 05:53.500:  now free to travel abroad for medical treatment. He'd been under house arrest since army officers
05:53.500 - 05:58.700:  seized power at the end of August. Many people have taken to social media saying he should be charged
05:58.700 - 06:04.600:  with corruption. So, do we know where Ali Bongo may be? Our African regional editor is Richard
06:04.600 - 06:11.660:  Hamilton. In 2018, Ali Bongo suffered a stroke and he then travelled to Morocco for medical
06:11.660 - 06:19.160:  treatment. And he has close links with King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Ali Bongo is reported to
06:19.160 - 06:24.420:  abort a villa in the palm grove of Marrakesh, called the palmery, which is a very nice place,
06:24.420 - 06:31.080:  lots of rich people with there. And also King Mohammed VI of Morocco is alleged to have a palace
06:31.080 - 06:38.060:  in Gabon. So, they have a very close relationship. So, it's been reported in French media that the
06:38.060 - 06:44.260:  regional block, Ekaz, which was negotiating about the coup, had discussed some sort of exit
06:44.260 - 06:51.680:  deal whereby Ali Bongo goes to Morocco. So, that's basically what we think behind the scenes
06:51.680 - 06:58.340:  is happening. And the coup leader himself, General Engweimer, is one of Ali Bongo's cousins. He's
06:58.340 - 07:04.160:  a former bodyguard. He worked for Omar Bongo, the father as well. So, he's worked for the Bongo
07:04.160 - 07:09.940:  family for a long time. And the suspicion is, and the opposition have been saying this, that there's
07:09.940 - 07:14.840:  some sort of deal going on to keep the Bongo family in power. We had talked to us a bit more about
07:14.840 - 07:19.900:  the family, because like you say, they've been around a while. They have. So, Omar Bongo, the father,
07:20.580 - 07:26.920:  took power after the death of the previous president in 1967 and ruled with an iron fist until
07:26.920 - 07:34.040:  2009 when he died. And then Ali Bongo, his son, took over. But for years, there were allegations,
07:34.220 - 07:41.180:  well more than that, that the Bongo family skimmed off all the oil wealth of the country. So, for
07:41.180 - 07:47.000:  example, one third of the population lived below the poverty line, and yet it's one of Africa's
07:47.340 - 07:54.120:  biggest producers of oil. And another sort of sad, well very sad statistic is that it has one of
07:54.120 - 08:00.380:  the world's highest child mortality rates. So, there was no sense that this vast oil wealth
08:00.860 - 08:06.560:  was going to trickle down to the rest of the population. There was a French investigation that
08:06.560 - 08:13.840:  said they had 39 properties in Paris and nine luxury cars. So, a lot of this anti-French sentiment
08:13.840 - 08:19.320:  may really be to do with the fact that the French authorities went after the Bongo family.
08:19.880 - 08:25.760:  The voice there of Richard Hamilton. The former Sri Lankan president got a bio-Rajapuksha
08:25.860 - 08:32.680:  as rejected allegations made in a British documentary that the deadly Easter Sunday bombings in 2019
08:32.680 - 08:39.200:  were orchestrated to help him win elections that year. The film featured a Sri Lankan political
08:39.200 - 08:45.120:  insider who accused a senior intelligence official linked to Mr. Rajapuksha of complicity in the
08:45.120 - 08:51.080:  attacks, which killed 269 people. With more details, here is our South Asia regional editor
08:51.420 - 08:56.180:  and Barrison of the Rajan. Goetapa here at Japuksha was selected Sri Lanka's president
08:56.180 - 09:03.200:  months after the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks promising to restore security. The British channel
09:03.200 - 09:09.880:  for documentary featuring a political insider accused a senior intelligence official of complicity
09:09.880 - 09:15.820:  in the bombings that helped create conditions for Mr. Rajapuksha's victory. Mr. Rajapuksha said
09:15.820 - 09:22.040:  the report was filled with the lies and was mostly an anti-Rajapuksha tyrant. After the documentary
09:22.040 - 09:27.080:  was aired, the current Sri Lankan government said it would appoint a parliamentary committee
09:27.080 - 09:33.820:  to look into the latest allegations. Police say a group of IS-inspired Islamists carried out the
09:33.820 - 09:39.720:  bombings targeting churches and high end hotels. Mr. Rajapuksha was forced to leave office
09:39.720 - 09:44.280:  last year following protests over an unprecedented economic crisis.
09:44.700 - 09:50.080:  And Barrison of the Rajan. California has become the first US state to
09:50.080 - 09:56.000:  approve a bill that will ban discrimination based on caste, the hierarchical social class system
09:56.000 - 10:01.980:  seen in Hindu society. Earlier this year, the BBC produced a documentary on caste bias among
10:01.980 - 10:07.680:  tech workers in the Silicon Valley. It's hoped the bill will protect people of South Asian descent
10:07.680 - 10:13.220:  in the state. However, not everyone supported the move with protests erupting outside the office
10:13.220 - 10:18.680:  of the Democratic Senator who sponsored the bill, Aisha Wahab. Here she is speaking with the BBC's
10:18.920 - 10:25.460:  Divina Gupta. You know, our district in particular is a very diverse district in the state of
10:25.460 - 10:31.600:  California, probably in the nation. And largely the diaspora that has reached out to me specifically
10:32.340 - 10:38.600:  have stated that they have received different types of discrimination in forms of housing
10:38.600 - 10:44.920:  discrimination, employment discrimination. There are more personal stories where people have
10:44.920 - 10:50.560:  talked about how if they drink a cup of water, it has been actually removed from the home and
10:50.560 - 10:57.460:  put outside near that homeowner's dog bowl when they are a healthcare worker taking care of
10:57.460 - 11:02.520:  somebody that needs the support because they are of different caste. Some have stated that they
11:02.520 - 11:07.480:  are not allowed to enter certain temples. We've seen this time and time again and we just want to
11:07.480 - 11:12.520:  make it very clear to people in the legal system as well as people in the public to know that
11:12.520 - 11:17.720:  caste discrimination should not exist in California. And if you were to be discriminated against,
11:17.720 - 11:23.660:  you have legal recourse to defend yourself. How does this bill now change lives of people?
11:24.220 - 11:28.680:  The reality is that this bill will allow for somebody who is being discriminated
11:29.180 - 11:36.860:  in regards to housing, education, or employment, and so forth to be able to defend themselves
11:36.860 - 11:41.280:  if there is a legitimate discrimination case. And obviously discrimination cases in general
11:41.280 - 11:45.140:  are very difficult to prove. Those individuals that feel that they have been discriminated against,
11:45.140 - 11:51.260:  of course, they have to prove it, but they are now able to go to a legal system to defend themselves.
11:51.640 - 11:58.460:  Not everybody is on board. So this bill has clearly touched in love with many people in this diaspora.
11:58.760 - 12:04.580:  What's been the opposition? Yes. The opposition, honestly, the talking points have been largely
12:04.580 - 12:12.080:  stating that it will allow for profiling and that it's only one particular religious group that
12:12.080 - 12:17.580:  you know, participate in this and so forth. And that's inaccurate. Number one, the majority of
12:17.580 - 12:22.300:  the state legislature that I've talked to me about it, many of them have joked that they
12:22.300 - 12:26.860:  didn't even know what cast was. They had to Google it. Number two is the fact that
12:27.900 - 12:32.420:  so I don't genuinely believe people will be profiled because people don't really understand it.
12:32.600 - 12:38.640:  I think the opposition is very upset that me as an Afghan, as a woman, as a Muslim,
12:39.460 - 12:44.660:  I'm carrying this bill, right? And you saw a lot of the Islamophobic commentary about
12:45.380 - 12:50.880:  the sexist commentary, the pure racism. And at the end of the day, I'm an American born and raised.
12:51.620 - 12:58.100:  And I truly believe in the American dream for all people and that foundation of the American dream
12:58.100 - 13:04.480:  is largely that you are judged based on your merit, not on your ethnicity, not on your gender,
13:04.480 - 13:11.380:  not on your age, but your ability and your desire to do more. And so I think that the
13:11.380 - 13:16.880:  opposition talking points really don't hold any water. That was Aisha Wahab, speaking to the
13:16.880 - 13:23.480:  BBC's Divina Gupta. Last year, about 70 children in the West African nation of the Gambia
13:23.480 - 13:29.420:  died because of suspected kidney complications allegedly caused by a consumption of cough syrup
13:29.420 - 13:35.200:  made in India. It follows the deaths of 12 children in the northern Indian town of Ramnagar,
13:35.200 - 13:40.540:  more than two years earlier, again after consuming cough syrups allegedly containing toxins.
13:40.540 - 13:45.980:  All of them were under five years of age. A year on since the first deaths in the Gambia,
13:45.980 - 13:50.980:  the BBC's Vinic Carey traveled across the Gambia man to Ramnagar to meet the families who share
13:50.980 - 14:00.080:  a profound grief and a struggle for justice. I always remember his eyes because he was looking at me
14:00.380 - 14:06.200:  and said my eyes. I'm also looking at him directly inside his eyes.
14:06.860 - 14:12.920:  Ebrima is from the Gambia, a country often called the Smiling Coast of West Africa,
14:13.520 - 14:21.100:  and his son Gleeful three-year-old Laman lived up to that picture. But in 2022, Laman
14:21.100 - 14:27.480:  became unwell. His dad got him a cough syrup and that joyful world fell apart.
14:28.180 - 14:33.780:  My wife told me that something strange I did not understand. I said what? Laman changed
14:33.780 - 14:39.820:  yesterday. He did not go to the toilet you will need. Shortly after taking the syrup, Laman's
14:39.820 - 14:46.900:  appetite reduced and later found it difficult to pass urine. Dr. said he had kidney issues.
14:47.720 - 14:52.700:  The health of the three-year-old quickly worsened and within seven days he died.
14:53.440 - 14:59.860:  But this was far from an isolated incident. 22-month-old Aminata suffered the same fate.
15:00.560 - 15:05.000:  The kidney is not functioning so they wanted to make this surgery because if the kidney is not
15:05.000 - 15:10.360:  working for some days then the waste product you cannot urinate so the unit will be expanding in
15:10.360 - 15:16.040:  the body. Hadad Momodoo recalls the last time he tried to speak to her own video call
15:16.440 - 15:23.980:  Ashley unconscious in a hospital bed. I love my child so much. I couldn't like stare at her for
15:23.980 - 15:30.240:  that long. I was trying to make her know that it's me. Papa talking to you. Can you see me?
15:30.240 - 15:36.920:  How are you doing? What's yours just like that? A year ago unsettling reports began emerging
15:36.920 - 15:43.040:  from the gambia. Children aged between two months and five years were dying after suffering
15:43.040 - 15:48.680:  lethal kidney damage. The cases were being linked to the consumption of an allegedly contaminated
15:48.680 - 15:54.840:  cough syrup produced in India. Four medicines are cough and cold syrups
15:54.860 - 16:02.680:  produced by maiden pharmaceuticals limited in India. WHO is conducting further investigation.
16:02.940 - 16:08.180:  The World Health Organization had earlier warned that the four cough syrups made by Indian company
16:08.180 - 16:13.020:  maiden farmer could be potentially linked with the deaths of children in the gambia.
16:13.360 - 16:19.780:  The products contained unacceptable amounts of toxins, diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol
16:19.780 - 16:25.360:  which could prove fatal on consumption. Gambian officials opened an inquiry and blamed
16:25.360 - 16:30.340:  India made cough syrups for the tragedy. The Indian government denies the link.
16:30.960 - 16:36.760:  Health Minister Dr. Mansook Manviya told News Agency A&I the cough syrups samples of maiden
16:36.760 - 16:45.800:  cleared the tests when checked. We asked the question what was the result of sample
16:45.800 - 16:53.720:  testing. They said they took 23 samples out of which four samples failed. If samples from a batch
16:53.720 - 17:00.860:  fail, all samples should fail. Why did only four samples fail? We also took samples here in
17:00.860 - 17:07.440:  checks. They all passed. Indian drug manufacturers too denied the charges.
17:08.100 - 17:13.180:  Maiden pharmaceuticals said in the past that it has full faith in the regulator and judiciary
17:13.180 - 17:20.620:  processes and it has done no wrong. In the end, the toxins allegedly killed nearly 70 children
17:20.620 - 17:28.720:  in the gambia and as many as 12 children in India in one case. Families who live nearly 10,000
17:28.720 - 17:34.560:  kilometers apart were now united in a harrowing grief but also in their fight for justice.
17:37.780 - 17:41.940:  The Northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh is home to several pharmaceutical companies.
17:42.820 - 17:49.400:  Among them, digital vision that is alleged to have produced the spurious setup that killed
17:49.400 - 17:54.520:  the children. An allegation that its owner Parshotam Goyal denies.
17:54.840 - 18:01.220:  We are not here to kill children. Why would we kill someone's child? We are manufacturing medicines.
18:01.260 - 18:08.460:  Not sponsored. Following police investigation, the matter is in court. The factory reportedly
18:08.460 - 18:14.640:  stayed closed for six months following the deaths but it was reopened following a court order.
18:16.680 - 18:22.520:  Meanwhile in the gambia, despite this tragedy, reliance on India made drugs is likely to continue.
18:22.940 - 18:26.860:  It's far cheaper than having to import them from America or Europe.
18:27.800 - 18:34.640:  But families of the victims want to seek change. We all have families. If the gambia and people
18:34.640 - 18:39.460:  manufacture medicine to send it to India and that medicine costs their debt of their babies,
18:39.460 - 18:47.560:  would they be happy? No. Wherever you are, Indian, Chinese, American, less respect one child.
18:48.020 - 18:52.820:  In June, the Gambian Health Ministry sacked the executive director of the Gambia Medicine's
18:52.820 - 18:58.120:  Control Agency, Marku Janikaira, following an inquiry into the children's debts.
18:59.040 - 19:05.580:  Now, families in India and in the Gambia are ready for a tough fight ahead and say they will not stop
19:05.580 - 19:09.600:  until they get justice. Now, was the BBC's Vinay Kure?

20:07.720 - 20:13.680:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they made
20:13.680 - 20:17.940:  their money. And then we decide if they are actually Good Bad or just plain wealthy.
20:18.080 - 20:23.320:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos really

20:37.440 - 20:42.900:  Now, here on the Global News podcast to women will compete for the Mexican presidency after
20:42.900 - 20:48.340:  the ruling party named former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Shainbaum as its candidate.
20:48.880 - 20:52.880:  It's the first time in the country's history that the president is guaranteed to be female.
20:53.000 - 20:58.060:  And it comes as Mexico announced that abortion will be decriminalized across the entire country.
20:58.060 - 21:04.180:  Stephanie Prentice told me more. Mexico looks all but certain to elect. It's first ever female
21:04.180 - 21:08.800:  ahead of state. We know that governing or in a party has put forward Claudia Shainbaum for
21:08.800 - 21:14.060:  next year's election. She's a politician. She's a scientist. She's an ally of Andrews Manuela
21:14.060 - 21:19.860:  Lopez-Obrador. And the opposition candidate is Sochil Gava. She's a senator and a business woman.
21:20.240 - 21:26.100:  This is being seen as a huge win by women's rights groups. One quarter, a feminist dream.
21:26.140 - 21:31.180:  And of course, it puts Mexico ahead of its neighbor at the US in electing a female president.
21:31.260 - 21:37.240:  Certainly progress for a country where women couldn't even vote until 1953. We know Mexico
21:37.240 - 21:43.400:  actually passed an amendment in 2019, setting a goal of gender parity in everything it said,
21:43.860 - 21:49.040:  including those races for elected office. And it already has a female chief justice in the Supreme
21:49.040 - 21:53.780:  Court and women leading the House of Congress. Let's pick up on the Supreme Court because we
21:53.780 - 21:57.560:  mentioned in the introduction there that abortions being decriminalized across the entire country.
21:58.280 - 22:02.460:  Well, you know, Latin America has historically some of the world's most restrictive abortion
22:02.940 - 22:07.940:  policies that has been shifting. This move in Mexico has been seen as a massive victory by the
22:07.940 - 22:12.900:  green wave movement for greater rights to abortion. There was a unanimous decision by the Supreme
22:12.900 - 22:19.860:  Court and prohibiting abortions was described as unconstitutional in that ruling. So in practice,
22:19.860 - 22:25.000:  that means all public health institutions must provide abortions for anyone who requests them.
22:25.280 - 22:30.220:  That's nationwide before it was just 12 out of the 32 states. Essentially what we're seeing
22:30.220 - 22:35.920:  is a shield against prosecutions. And that's women having abortions, but also for doctors performing
22:35.920 - 22:42.280:  abortions before the chance of a jail term of up to five years. It would be a miss if not naive
22:42.280 - 22:46.240:  to not acknowledge, though, that there is still a long way to go with regards to women's rights
22:46.240 - 22:52.660:  and also safety in Mexico. Well, yeah, according to recent government data, 10 women and girls are
22:52.660 - 22:59.820:  killed every day in Mexico by partners or other family members and 2481 women and girls
22:59.820 - 23:05.180:  were officially reported as missing last year there. There was a recent documentary looking into
23:05.180 - 23:10.460:  this. It said according to the data, women who survive acts of violence in Mexico, they fail to
23:10.460 - 23:16.480:  receive justice due to in its words, legal loopholes, negligence, a lack of gender perspective in
23:16.480 - 23:23.760:  the legal system and harmful social norms. Stephanie Prentice. German and Israeli officials have
23:23.760 - 23:29.060:  criticised the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for his recent comments about Jews and the
23:29.060 - 23:35.980:  Holocaust. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, has accused Mr Abbas of pure anti-Semitism.
23:35.980 - 23:42.080:  Yulanael is in Jerusalem. The aging Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has previously been
23:42.080 - 23:47.780:  denounced by Jewish groups as a Holocaust denier for his doctoral thesis on the Nazis and Zionism.
23:47.780 - 23:52.780:  Yet over the years, he's continued to give rambling speeches, expounding his offensive views.
23:52.780 - 23:58.140:  In this recent address to the Fatah revolutionary council, which was later aired on Palestine TV,
23:58.140 - 24:03.660:  he said that the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had ordered the mass murder of Jews because of what he
24:03.660 - 24:08.640:  described as their social role as moneylenders, rather than out of animosity to Judaism.
24:08.640 - 24:14.480:  He also resurrected a long abandoned historic theory that European Ashkenazi Jews were not
24:14.480 - 24:21.080:  descended from the ancient Israelites. Yulanael. For almost a decade, civil war has been grinding
24:21.080 - 24:27.040:  on in Yemen, pushing the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of collapse. There has been
24:27.040 - 24:32.300:  less violence since a temporary cease-fire last year, but there is no sign of a deal to permanently
24:32.300 - 24:37.860:  end the conflict. In the midst of all the death and destruction, however, there is also resilience.
24:37.900 - 24:43.300:  The BBC's Olga Geron has been to visit a young blind boy who she first met back in 2021.
24:43.420 - 24:47.720:  He helped his school get rebuilt after he was destroyed by bombing.
24:52.180 - 24:58.460:  I'm on the outskirts of the city of Taz in a farming community surrounded by mountains.
24:59.760 - 25:05.440:  I've come to meet a young boy I first met two and a half years ago. When he was nine years old,
25:05.440 - 25:13.240:  he's called Ahmed, and he was teaching a class in his local school, a bombed out shell of a building.
25:14.600 - 25:19.740:  We've come back to catch up with Ahmed and see how things are with him, with the school,
25:20.740 - 25:25.380:  and with the war that he's grown up in. He's been blind from birth.
25:25.380 - 25:26.100:  I'm Ahmed.
25:27.340 - 25:28.780:  Ahmed, hello, hello, how are you?
25:28.800 - 25:29.380:  I'm good to see you.
25:30.280 - 25:30.820:  Keep up, Alec.
25:33.040 - 25:37.860:  I'm sitting with Ahmed and three of his sisters who are also blind.
25:38.640 - 25:44.440:  He's in a blue shirt with a navy trim and a navy waistcoat, and he's smiling just the way
25:44.440 - 25:49.700:  I remember him. When was the last time you heard fighting and explosions?
25:50.620 - 25:52.300:  Was the late last night.
25:54.140 - 25:56.880:  It was very scary. We were scared of gunshots.
25:57.880 - 26:01.400:  When the fighting starts, we can't go to the park or the valley or anywhere.
26:03.080 - 26:05.860:  It's worse now. We only heard gunshots before.
26:06.860 - 26:13.060:  Now we hit bomb explosions, shoot him, everything. When we hear it, we get scared and hide.
26:13.540 - 26:18.480:  This was Ahmed as we first heard him.
26:19.960 - 26:20.900:  Loud and clear.
26:22.680 - 26:27.000:  He was leading morning assembly at Al-Wachta's primary school.
26:30.140 - 26:32.420:  Ahmed wasn't just the star pupil.
26:32.940 - 26:39.340:  He was standing in as a teacher in a classroom with no windows and no desks.
26:39.340 - 26:45.800:  He gave us a wish list of repairs for the school and our audience responded.
26:47.280 - 26:51.980:  Well, I've just come into the yard of the Al-Wachta primary school and
26:52.720 - 26:54.500:  what a difference since my last visit.
26:55.720 - 27:00.440:  To my right, there's a brand new school block. There are six classrooms.
27:01.700 - 27:02.820:  It looks like a proper school.
27:06.040 - 27:11.080:  Inside one of the new classrooms, we see rows of wooden desks and benches
27:11.820 - 27:15.000:  and four walls and a roof as Ahmed requested.
27:15.920 - 27:20.680:  A Yemeni donor built the new block and a British charity donated the equipment.
27:22.560 - 27:26.460:  Ahmed sits in the front row, giving the changes, top marks.
27:29.540 - 27:32.080:  I asked for a school to be studied and learned.
27:32.460 - 27:39.680:  And for those who come after, I hope I can study and learn until the end of time.
27:40.600 - 27:42.320:  And that the school will get even better.
27:43.380 - 27:45.100:  What do you want to do when you finish school?
27:45.900 - 27:46.300:  What job?
27:47.580 - 27:54.640:  I want to be a teacher and a pilot and an engineer and a driver or a doctor.
27:55.260 - 27:56.360:  I want to be everything.
27:56.540 - 27:58.880:  Do you think you'll be able to do all these things?
27:59.460 - 28:00.660:  Yes, sure.
28:01.180 - 28:05.640:  I would do everything and I will marry a beautiful girl from the city.
28:10.520 - 28:15.460:  As the sun goes down, Ahmed splashes about in the river near his home.
28:17.180 - 28:19.700:  He has already overcome so much.
28:21.460 - 28:24.060:  This child of war is full of hope.
28:25.720 - 28:27.800:  That report there by Oligarim.
28:28.580 - 28:34.800:  The gathering of leaders from the G20 group of leading industrial nations is taking place in India this weekend.
28:35.420 - 28:37.320:  With so many problems facing the world at the moment,
28:37.320 - 28:42.540:  it's a crucial forum to find solutions to political, environmental and economic challenges.
28:43.240 - 28:47.140:  It's also an opportunity for India in particular to showcase its qualities.
28:47.840 - 28:51.040:  One area where it hopes to shine is in the dining room in particular with its
28:51.040 - 28:52.560:  world famous cuisines.
28:52.920 - 28:57.340:  A key player in this will be Chef Aaron Sundaraj from the Taj Palace Hotel in Delhi.
28:57.900 - 29:01.860:  He's in charge providing top-quality food to over 300 people,
29:02.220 - 29:04.780:  including heads of state and other G20 delegates.
29:04.780 - 29:07.380:  He told Devina Gupta about the preparations.
29:07.420 - 29:11.980:  You should be able to showcase things which people are able to take back and say, wow,
29:12.620 - 29:13.620:  you know, India is diverse.
29:13.620 - 29:18.760:  Every visiting delegation coming into India has that expectation of,
29:18.760 - 29:22.480:  I need to try this and I just hope it's not too spicy.
29:22.780 - 29:25.200:  So which is one dish that, for example, you would avoid?
29:25.520 - 29:29.860:  I would avoid products that are overly spiced.
29:30.480 - 29:35.140:  I would not, you know, dilute, say, for example, a chicken tikka and make it less spicy.
29:35.140 - 29:39.780:  But I would add maybe a flavour like a muck mali tikka, which is not.
29:40.200 - 29:43.060:  Flavors of coriander mint and it's still chargrilled.
29:43.520 - 29:45.480:  And it brings the essence of India to the table.
29:46.440 - 29:50.800:  And you should keep in mind sensitivities of religion.
29:50.800 - 29:52.740:  You should, it's a lot of hard work.
29:53.020 - 29:55.940:  You mentioned that there are sensitivities involved.
29:56.920 - 29:58.880:  Or you would take folk off the menu completely.
29:59.420 - 30:01.140:  Because it just makes it a lot more easier.
30:01.840 - 30:06.700:  And it's a lot more acceptable across multiple religions.
30:06.740 - 30:08.880:  You keep it easy, you keep it simple.
30:09.520 - 30:11.560:  I'm guessing B-forces are off the table.
30:12.440 - 30:13.320:  It is completely off.
30:14.460 - 30:17.440:  There are two heads of state on the same table.
30:17.440 - 30:18.500:  And it's an intimate setting.
30:18.500 - 30:20.860:  The service time isn't that crucial.
30:20.860 - 30:22.620:  Who gets that plate first?
30:22.960 - 30:23.980:  It's in unison.
30:23.980 - 30:27.560:  You have to mention that there are two guys who are practiced.
30:27.620 - 30:29.020:  So you actually do a practice.
30:29.840 - 30:33.200:  The guys walk in and then they look at each other and then they place it.
30:33.200 - 30:34.320:  You can't have someone clap.
30:34.320 - 30:37.960:  You know, it doesn't work that way.
30:38.340 - 30:40.120:  So, you know, there is no sound allowances.
30:40.460 - 30:42.720:  Because it doesn't work that way.
30:42.920 - 30:43.560:  Get the food.
30:45.040 - 30:48.120:  So it works with a lot of coordination, a lot of practice.
30:48.880 - 30:50.200:  When you practice and you see the dance,
30:50.680 - 30:51.560:  it is currently happening.
30:52.200 - 30:53.500:  And you see it happen together.
30:54.180 - 30:56.000:  I think that's the best part of this entire year.
30:56.360 - 30:58.900:  The chef, Aaron Sundaraj, speaking to Devina Gupta.
31:01.780 - 31:02.780:  And that's all from us for now.
31:02.780 - 31:05.540:  But there will be a new edition of the podcast a little later.
31:05.540 - 31:07.560:  If you want to comment on this one or any of the topic,
31:07.560 - 31:08.340:  send us an email.
31:08.340 - 31:12.000:  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.

31:17.600 - 31:20.720:  This edition was mixed by Holly Palmer and the producer was married strong.
31:20.720 - 31:23.280:  The editor Karam Martin, I'm Gareth Barlow.
31:23.340 - 31:24.560:  And until next time, goodbye.
