*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:17.780* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Nick Mars,
*00:17.780- 00:24.380* :  and at 14 hours GMT on Friday 22 September, these are our main stories. Anti-government protests are
*00:24.380- 00:31.920* :  held in the Armenian capital over Azerbaijan's defeat of ethnic Armenian separatists in Nagorno-Karabakh.
*00:32.560- 00:37.920* :  A military judge at Guantanamo Bay has ruled that a Yemeni man charged over the 9-11 attacks
*00:37.920- 00:44.040* :  is mentally unfit to stand trial. The Indian Parliament passes a bill that will reserve a third
*00:44.040- 00:51.760* :  of seats in Parliament and state assemblers for women. Also in this podcast, a stash of the opioid
*00:51.760- 00:58.780* :  fentanyl is found in the New York nursery where a toddler has died of a suspected drug overdose.
*00:59.620- 01:04.920* :  And seven years after blasting off, a rocket prepares to deliver what scientists hope will be the
*01:04.920- 01:10.800* :  secrets of how life began on Earth. We're addressing profound questions that at some point in our
*01:10.800- 01:16.620* :  lives, everybody asks ourselves, where did we come from? And more importantly, are we alone in the
*01:16.620- 01:25.940* :  universe? Many of the world's most entrenched conflicts come down to issues of identity and self-determination.
*01:25.940- 01:31.860* :  The crisis in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is one such conflict. It lies within
*01:31.860- 01:37.640* :  Azerbaijan, but for decades, ethnic Armenians who live there have been trying to create their own
*01:37.640- 01:42.420* :  independent state. It's led to countless acts of violence in which thousands have died.
*01:43.360- 01:48.620* :  There's been more fighting this week with Azerbaijan forces pushing back separatist militants.
*01:49.280- 01:54.720* :  Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, the Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan
*01:54.720- 02:00.800* :  accused Azerbaijan of unlawful actions. Well, each of us comes here to contribute to peace
*02:01.480- 02:08.220* :  in our region in South Caucasus on 19th of September Azerbaijan unleashed yet another large scale
*02:08.460- 02:13.760* :  against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh in blatant violation of the international law.
*02:14.000- 02:19.060* :  The Armenian Foreign Minister accused his neighbour of wanting to finalize the ethnic cleansing
*02:19.060- 02:26.260* :  of Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian population. Meanwhile, in the Azerbaijan capital Baku Hikmet Hajiyev,
*02:26.500- 02:32.720* :  foreign policy adviser to the president said Azerbaijan wanted to reintegrate the region peacefully.
*02:32.720- 02:38.060* :  They will be difficulties, and they could be certain challenges as well, nobody denies them.
*02:38.420- 02:43.660* :  The point I think is that we have a political bill to go forward with their integration,
*02:43.860- 02:48.520* :  and while it was in integration, we are talking about a peaceful reintegration model
*02:48.980- 02:53.520* :  of Karabakh Armenians through their political, economic, social, spectrum of Azerbaijan.
*02:54.020- 03:02.160* :  Siranush Salksyan is an ethnic Armenian in Stepanaket, the de facto capital of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*03:02.660- 03:06.580* :  She says no one believes the talks at the UN or elsewhere will work.
*03:06.940- 03:14.780* :  Here it doesn't matter if you are in one village or in Stepanaket, there is no safety,
*03:14.780- 03:25.660* :  and these negotiations, talks, nobody actually believe it, nobody believe like somehow it is
*03:25.660- 03:33.540* :  possible without international guarantees, like we can stay here. And if there is not provided,
*03:34.480- 03:36.560* :  most of people, yes, they want to live.
*03:36.920- 03:41.380* :  Our co-cuses correspondent, Ray Hentomitri, tell me more about the situation there.
*03:41.620- 03:46.260* :  Reports from Stepanaket is that there are thousands of displaced people,
*03:46.260- 03:52.140* :  these are the people who had to leave their homes from the villages that are close to the front line.
*03:52.580- 03:59.320* :  A lot of people spent the night in schools or in churches in kind of temporary places.
*03:59.640- 04:06.180* :  And I guess the biggest question for them is they don't really know what's coming next.
*04:06.960- 04:14.400* :  And as we just heard from Siranush Salksyan journalist in Stepanaket, a lot of people would want
*04:14.400- 04:20.520* :  to leave Nagorno-Karabakh, but no such option is been given to them just yet.
*04:20.840- 04:25.040* :  You also quoted the Armenian Foreign Minister at the UN Security Council,
*04:25.040- 04:32.900* :  and he accused Azerbaijan of wanting to carry out an ethnic cleansing and said that there were
*04:32.900- 04:38.000* :  facts of mass crimes, and he said that the images from Nagorno-Karabakh are really,
*04:38.000- 04:44.880* :  really shocking, they're homeless women, children, and mothers, a lot of people who are searching for
*04:44.880- 04:51.940* :  their children. And they all think that, you know, because every single family in Nagorno-Karabakh
*04:51.940- 04:58.680* :  would have a family member who fought in many wars with Azerbaijan, and they worried that they
*04:58.680- 05:05.420* :  would be arrested. But this morning, we heard from Azerbaijan, a presidential special advisor,
*05:05.500- 05:12.760* :  Hikmat Hajiyev, who said that Azerbaijan is envisaging an amnesty for Karabakh Armenian fighters,
*05:12.760- 05:19.160* :  for those who give up their arms. Although, Azerbaijan says there are some individual groups and
*05:19.160- 05:25.420* :  officers who have refused to lay down their arms so far, and they don't want to accept
*05:25.420- 05:29.980* :  Azerbaijan in terms of conditions. So there's a risk of insurgency.
*05:30.200- 05:36.080* :  To briefly, Rayhan, this is all come about because the Armenians within Nagorno-Karabakh are on
*05:36.080- 05:42.560* :  that back foot militarily. Meanwhile, in the Armenian capital, a lot of protesters out on the streets
*05:43.300- 05:47.860* :  protesting about what's going on, probably putting pressure on the Armenian authorities to do
*05:47.860- 05:54.040* :  something about it. There were big protests on Tuesday and Wednesday when Azerbaijan began,
*05:54.040- 06:00.520* :  what it describes as its anti-terror operation, much less so yesterday. But of course,
*06:00.520- 06:05.920* :  there is pressure on the Armenian Prime Minister to resign over the handling of this situation.
*06:06.360- 06:12.420* :  Since 2002, almost 800 people have been detained at one time or another at the American
*06:12.420- 06:19.280* :  base at Guantanamo Bay on the island of Cuba. Of those, 11 have been charged with war crimes
*06:19.280- 06:24.180* :  in the military commission system. 10 are awaiting trial and one has been convicted.
*06:24.920- 06:29.780* :  Now, a Yemeni man accused of involvement with the September of the 11th attacks in New York City
*06:29.780- 06:35.800* :  22 years ago has been ruled unfit to stand trial. I've found out more details from our security
*06:35.800- 06:42.300* :  correspondent, Gordon Carrera. Well, this is Ramsay Bin Al-Shab, who is one of the better-known suspects
*06:42.300- 06:49.360* :  held at Guantanamo Bay linked directly to the September 11th, 2001 attacks. He was accused,
*06:49.700- 06:54.900* :  or he is accused of being an organizer of the Hamburg cell, which was one of the
*06:55.220- 07:00.840* :  the place where one of the groups of hijackers came from, which carried out the attack in the
*07:00.840- 07:05.440* :  United States and having wanted to actually be part of the attack himself, and a link back to
*07:05.440- 07:10.500* :  Al-Qaeda, which organized the attacks out of Afghanistan. So, he was considered a significant
*07:10.500- 07:18.440* :  player. That's the allegation in those attacks, and this was going to be one of the most high
*07:18.440- 07:25.840* :  profile of these military commissions that have been due to take place at Guantanamo. He was going
*07:25.840- 07:30.340* :  to stand trial, along with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, who's often considered the kind of mastermind
*07:30.340- 07:37.220* :  of those attacks, but his lawyers had been arguing that he was mentally unfit to stand trial for
*07:37.220- 07:43.480* :  the death penalty specifically, which is what he was at risk of being given as a sentence. Now,
*07:43.980- 07:51.040* :  the argument was specifically that he was mentally unfit because he was suffering from post-traumatic
*07:51.040- 07:58.180* :  stress disorder and delusion because of the way he'd been treated in custody specifically
*07:58.680- 08:03.340* :  after he'd been arrested. He spent time in what we're called black sites, which were secret
*08:03.340- 08:10.840* :  places where the CIA carried out torture on suspects, and he was one of those held in those before
*08:10.840- 08:17.000* :  being transferred to Guantanamo Bay openly. So, the accusation was that that has left him mentally
*08:17.000- 08:22.680* :  unfit, and that's always been one of the challenges for these military commissions is that those defending
*08:22.680- 08:29.200* :  the suspects have been saying that evidence was tated, or in this case, someone was made mentally
*08:29.200- 08:37.340* :  unfit by what had happened to them in custody. And in this case, yesterday, the judge at Guantanamo
*08:37.340- 08:42.760* :  agreed with those defenceless lawyers. And Gordon, briefly, do we know what the status of the other
*08:42.760- 08:48.480* :  10 people awaiting trial is, whether or not they will argue similar things? Well, I think we're
*08:48.480- 08:53.700* :  expecting this, they are not quite arguing the same thing in terms of being mentally unfit,
*08:53.960- 08:58.300* :  but the legal battles have been going on for so long over these military commissions,
*08:58.960- 09:04.740* :  the that there's been delay after delay, and it is really unclear how long this process will
*09:04.740- 09:11.040* :  really take. Gordon Carrera. After six attempts, a bill has been passed in India, which is set to
*09:11.040- 09:16.560* :  reserve a third of the seats in the lower house of Parliament, and in state assemblies for women.
*09:16.620- 09:22.300* :  The bill was first introduced almost three decades ago. It often failed because of strong
*09:22.300- 09:28.060* :  disapproval from the country's overwhelmingly male lawmakers. Our South Asia correspondent,
*09:28.620- 09:34.020* :  Samira Hussein told us more about it. If you look at the way women have played a very significant
*09:34.020- 09:39.580* :  role in politics, they've had female prime ministers, the currently there's a female president
*09:39.580- 09:46.560* :  of India, and if you look at the way polls have worked, there's as much trust in female politicians
*09:46.560- 09:52.080* :  as there are in male politicians. But if you look at the representation within Parliament,
*09:52.080- 09:58.280* :  you're seeing that representation has only come up since in the 80s from 9% it's gone up to about
*09:58.280- 10:03.620* :  15%. So what this bill is aiming to do is to try and get more political participation
*10:03.620- 10:11.660* :  from women by reserving 33% of all seats for women. Now, this is going to last once it's implemented,
*10:11.660- 10:18.320* :  it's going to last for about 15 years, and then it can be reinstated. Women are representing a
*10:18.320- 10:24.260* :  massive voting block in this country, and if you don't have enough women representing in Parliament,
*10:24.260- 10:29.480* :  then do you really have an effective government that really reflects the population? So they're
*10:29.480- 10:35.860* :  really trying to encourage more women representation. I think what's interesting is the political aspect
*10:35.860- 10:42.860* :  to this is that it's actually not going to be implemented until about 2029. So the opposition
*10:42.860- 10:49.020* :  party is quite critical of the fact that the ruling government has said, okay, let's enact this
*10:49.020- 10:54.100* :  bill and let's push it through after 30 years, and they're saying that, look, this is really an
*10:54.100- 10:59.480* :  election ploy since there's going to be elections next year in India. This allows the ruling BJP
*10:59.480- 11:04.400* :  party to say, look at what we're doing. We're trying to get more women into Parliament,
*11:04.400- 11:11.080* :  but because it's not going to go into effect until 2029, it doesn't really benefit any other
*11:11.080- 11:15.800* :  political parties. What the Indian government is really trying to signal is that there should be
*11:15.800- 11:21.300* :  more participation by women, that women should be more encouraged to come and join and represent
*11:21.300- 11:27.520* :  in politics. Samira Hussein, the Ukrainian president, the Lorda Mirzelensky, has arrived in Canada.
*11:27.860- 11:31.780* :  He was met on the wrong way in Ottawa by the Canadian Prime Minister, just in Trudeau.
*11:32.340- 11:37.160* :  It comes a day after his meeting with Joe Biden at the White House as he seeks to rally support
*11:37.160- 11:43.160* :  for his troops ongoing offensive against Russia. Speaking in Washington, Mr. Zalensky said Ukraine
*11:43.160- 11:48.360* :  was looking for more funding and insisted the war was vitally important for the West.
*11:48.620- 11:56.740* :  If we fall half of Europe would again be in danger of being in Moscow's sphere of influence,
*11:57.660- 12:03.380* :  but American investment in Ukrainian security and global protection of freedom is working.
*12:03.420- 12:12.400* :  100% every cent. While I ask the BBC's James Waterhouse in Kiev, what's in store for Mr. Zalensky
*12:12.400- 12:18.060* :  from the Canadians? You'll expect a continuation of this warm reception. Canada is another loyal ally
*12:18.060- 12:25.180* :  of Ukraine. It is a military supporter. There is a sizable Ukrainian community in Canada who are
*12:25.180- 12:31.160* :  provided with state support. But I think the real prize of this diplomatic journey of
*12:31.160- 12:37.600* :  President Zalensky is behind him in the US with which spearheads the Western Allies effort
*12:38.100- 12:42.700* :  in supporting Ukraine. I think what we're seeing from President Zalensky this time around.
*12:42.700- 12:47.800* :  Yes, we are seeing some pomp and ceremony. We are seeing some warm ham shakes and embraces,
*12:47.800- 12:52.060* :  not least with Joe Biden yesterday in the Oval Office. But I think there is now hard
*12:52.060- 12:57.920* :  negotiations to be done for President Zalensky because we are starting to see a direct correlation
*12:58.080- 13:05.120* :  between the pace and scale of Ukraine's counteroffensive and the increased skepticism,
*13:05.120- 13:10.400* :  shall we say, in political circles. There have been discrete meetings with some Republican politicians
*13:11.040- 13:17.680* :  yesterday where there are some hard-aligned views that questioning why Ukraine should continue
*13:17.680- 13:21.260* :  to be presented within their words blank checks. And they're questioning what a Ukrainian
*13:21.260- 13:26.860* :  victory could look like. And when Kiev has always said that we will not be rushed in our
*13:26.860- 13:31.340* :  military efforts, where they lost a lot of men and equipment early on in their counteroffensive,
*13:31.760- 13:37.120* :  this will be a real test of that. And this is why we are seeing President Zalensky continue to
*13:37.120- 13:42.660* :  try and reach those who are starting to become increasingly skeptical. And James, over the last
*13:42.660- 13:47.540* :  couple of days, we've seen mixed reports coming out of Poland as to whether or not they're going
*13:47.540- 13:53.880* :  to carry on sending military aid to Ukraine. How much concern is there in Kiev right now?
*13:54.820- 14:00.780* :  I think on the issue of Poland, I think if we look at the language being used, concerns have been
*14:00.780- 14:05.580* :  eased slightly. The Polish are saying the words are taken out of slightly misinterpreted,
*14:05.580- 14:10.720* :  they're not currently producing weapons for Ukraine, but they were dangling some question marks
*14:10.720- 14:16.500* :  over future supplies, all in another argument over Ukrainian grain, which has flooded Polish markets
*14:16.500- 14:21.680* :  and subsequent bans have been brought in. It's turned very messy, but I think what it is
*14:21.680- 14:28.140* :  translating to is a very difficult diplomatic period for President Zalensky, who will be desperate
*14:28.140- 14:34.180* :  to turn this into something more tangible. James Waterhouse. Mechal Mining has always been blamed
*14:34.180- 14:40.160* :  for polluting the world's rivers and flood plains. A new research has revealed just how much
*14:40.160- 14:46.960* :  contamination it causes. The global study by British scientists estimates that tens of millions of
*14:46.960- 14:51.880* :  people have been affected by potentially dangerous concentrations of toxic waste. Our science
*14:51.880- 14:56.040* :  and climate correspondent, Victoria Gill, has been taking a closer look at their findings.
*14:56.620- 15:01.120* :  Waste metals from mines can be bound up in sediment that gets washed down river channels
*15:01.120- 15:06.440* :  and spread across flood plains. These researchers mapped the location and type of every active
*15:06.440- 15:11.480* :  and abandoned metal mine in the world and studied how the waste moved and accumulated in the
*15:11.480- 15:16.480* :  environment. This allowed them to estimate the total area of the earth that's polluted by mine
*15:16.480- 15:21.760* :  waste. Combining that with population data revealed that 23 million people around the world
*15:21.760- 15:26.540* :  live on land that's officially contaminated with levels above an internationally recognized
*15:26.540- 15:31.280* :  safe threshold. Whether those people are affected by that pollution is impossible to say from
*15:31.280- 15:36.520* :  this study. But crops grown or livestock grazed on contaminated land can absorb that pollution.
*15:37.120- 15:42.040* :  And as the demand surges for many metals like copper and lithium used in electrification and
*15:42.040- 15:46.340* :  battery technology, the researchers say that future mining needs to be planned carefully to
*15:46.340- 15:52.420* :  avoid adding to this toxic legacy. Victoria Gill. Still to come on the global news podcast.
*15:52.540- 15:58.200* :  Brazil's Supreme Court debates whether to decriminalize abortion up to 12 weeks.
*15:58.200- 16:05.120* :  I think I speak to everyone when I say that it was a nightmare she says we aren't the owners
*16:05.120- 16:09.820* :  of our bodies are we? It was something that could have been so simple but they kept prolonging
*16:16.220- 16:21.100* :  the suffering. The attacker had very good knowledge of banking systems, 3.1 billion dollars
*16:21.100- 16:25.440* :  in stolen funds, money laundering operations, a cyber criminal group. These are smart guys.
*16:26.020- 16:31.540* :  Season 1 and 2 of the Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service are available in full right now.
*16:32.000- 16:36.320* :  Following the twists and turns in the incredible story of the Lazarus group hackers.
*16:36.960- 16:40.380* :  The Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service catch up with the whole series now
*16:40.820- 16:42.400* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:48.380- 16:53.740* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. A huge supply of the synthetic drug
*16:53.740- 16:59.960* :  fentanyl has been found in a children's daycare centre in New York after the death of a child.
*17:00.660- 17:03.560* :  Our North America correspondent Sean Dilly has this report.
*17:04.040- 17:09.320* :  Police in New York say they found over a dozen bags containing brown and white powder
*17:09.980- 17:15.840* :  and it was secreted under a trap door in a nap room, a sleeping room where young children
*17:15.840- 17:22.080* :  were sleeping. The owner and the tenant have been charged with narcotics and obstruction charges
*17:22.080- 17:27.360* :  but they have essentially said that they believe as a result of running a drug operation from
*17:27.360- 17:33.160* :  essentially what is a nursery, they're responsible for poisoning four babies and killing one of them.
*17:33.320- 17:39.440* :  The legitimate use for fentanyl is for cancer patients and for those recovering from surgery.
*17:39.440- 17:45.800* :  It's incredibly potent. People will be familiar with morphine. It's a synthetic opioid but
*17:45.800- 17:51.700* :  unlike morphine, the same quantities are between 50 and 100 times more potent.
*17:51.700- 17:56.520* :  Politicians from each side of the political divide say that it's reached pandemic levels.
*17:56.520- 18:02.120* :  Now give you a little bit of an idea of scale on that one. Back in around 2010, around 10%
*18:02.220- 18:08.820* :  of drugs deaths in the United States were as a result of overdosing on fentanyl. That's raised
*18:08.820- 18:14.100* :  to around two thirds today, possibly because it is so much cheaper than other drugs and cheaper
*18:14.100- 18:18.400* :  than heroin for instance and you know it would have a similar effect to those who use it.
*18:18.780- 18:25.800* :  Originally fentanyl comes from China in its raw form. It then makes its way across into
*18:25.820- 18:32.940* :  Mexico and this is why it becomes such a politically hot topic because Mexico is where this raw material
*18:32.940- 18:38.660* :  is processed and becomes the fentanyl that's distributed across the United States and the product
*18:38.660- 18:44.980* :  that's killing so many Americans. Sean Dilly. Brazil's Supreme Court has started voting on whether
*18:44.980- 18:52.320* :  to decriminalize abortion. However, the session was quickly postponed after a minister called for
*18:52.320- 18:58.100* :  the vote to take place in person instead of a via video and no new date has yet been set.
*18:58.880- 19:04.300* :  Currently abortion is only allowed in three cases that of rape, risk to the woman's life
*19:04.720- 19:10.540* :  and when the fetus has an undeveloped brain. If the Supreme Court votes in favor, abortion
*19:10.540- 19:16.760* :  would be decriminalized up to 12 weeks gestation. Our South America correspondent Katie Watson
*19:16.760- 19:24.500* :  reports from Sao Paulo. Yes, we could Mexican women chanted, echoing President Obama's
*19:24.500- 19:29.820* :  favorite phrase. This was the moment the country's Supreme Court decriminalized abortion
*19:29.820- 19:36.340* :  earlier this month. Dressed in green t-shirts, waving green bandanas, the decision is the latest
*19:36.340- 19:42.580* :  milestone for the green wave movement. Regional activists that have worked tirelessly to liberalize
*19:42.580- 19:49.900* :  strict abortion laws across Latin America. In this week, attentions turn to Brazil.
*19:49.900- 19:56.540* :  Supreme Court Judge Rosa Weber is about to retire, but before she does, she decided to add a vote
*19:56.540- 19:59.840* :  on decriminalizing abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
*20:01.740- 20:06.900* :  Sao Paulo, the vote couldn't come soon enough. Three weeks ago, she had an abortion.
*20:06.900- 20:12.400* :  The baby she was expecting had a rare condition that meant it wouldn't survive birth and could
*20:12.400- 20:18.600* :  have risked her life too. Therein began a painful process. To access the right, she thought would
*20:18.600- 20:25.500* :  be a given. I asked the doctor of my baby who would survive, she tells me. He told me I had to
*20:25.500- 20:29.860* :  wait for it to be born. The nurse who was with him said the baby's heart was beating,
*20:30.400- 20:35.680* :  that I'd regret the decision in the future. Through tears, Paloma told him the choice was hers.
*20:37.680- 20:41.700* :  Only it wasn't. There were only three cases in which abortion is allowed in Brazil,
*20:42.160- 20:47.240* :  rape, when the woman's life is at risk, or in the case of Anencephaly, when the fetus's brain is
*20:47.240- 20:52.160* :  undeveloped. Paloma's case wasn't one of those. She was told though that with two supporting
*20:52.160- 20:58.700* :  doctors, a judge could likely grant a termination. Her doctor refused and it took six weeks to be
*20:58.700- 21:05.980* :  granted one, jumping through hurdles all the while. I think I speak for everyone when I say that
*21:05.980- 21:10.520* :  it was a nightmare, she says. We aren't the owners of our bodies, are we? It was something that could
*21:10.520- 21:19.320* :  have been so simple that they kept prolonging the suffering. For Natalia, though, there's never
*21:19.320- 21:24.960* :  an excuse to end a pregnancy. At 21, she nearly had an abortion, until her religious mother
*21:24.960- 21:31.100* :  convinced her otherwise. Ten years on, now she actively campaigns against liberalizing abortion laws.
*21:31.100- 21:35.240* :  She says that a decision by the Supreme Court would be purely political.
*21:38.800- 21:44.600* :  We all know the president Lula has a leftist agenda, an abortionist agenda. Feminists
*21:44.660- 21:50.180* :  defend freedom to abort, which comes from their sexual liberation. The issues of abortion and
*21:50.180- 21:59.980* :  feminism work together and they're linked to the left. But across Brazil and the region,
*21:59.980- 22:05.960* :  these voices of conservatism are being drowned out by doctors calls to treat this as a public health
*22:05.960- 22:11.940* :  issue. It's estimated that by the time a woman is 40, one in seven Brazilians have had at least one
*22:12.320- 22:17.040* :  abortion. Their argument is that women will seek abortions regardless and they need to be kept safe.
*22:20.660- 22:26.140* :  Dr. Roberta Cronenberger Santos works in the women's hospital in Santo André, near São Paulo.
*22:26.720- 22:31.380* :  She's had cases of desperate women who've tried to carry out abortions at home, by the time
*22:31.380- 22:38.580* :  they come into hospital, they're bleeding and have infections. We have to understand that
*22:38.580- 22:43.360* :  is not a political decision. It's about choices and we all have a right to choose.
*22:43.920- 22:48.920* :  The more we talk about it, the more people we will understand. We have never talked so much
*22:48.920- 22:54.580* :  about women's rights as we are now. Talking about the displeasuredness. All those discussions have
*22:54.580- 23:01.840* :  come together. Brazilians are watching the Supreme Court carefully. After discussing the issue
*23:01.840- 23:06.700* :  for decades on both sides, few can believe this vote is actually happening.
*23:09.500- 23:13.800* :  Katie Watson. In our earlier podcast, we brought you news that the Australian
*23:13.800- 23:19.280* :  media mogul, Rupert Murdoch, is stepping down from the helm of his businesses after many
*23:19.280- 23:25.040* :  decades. His eldest son, Lachlan, is taking over as chairman of both his newspaper and TV
*23:25.040- 23:32.520* :  empires, Newscore and Fox. 12 years ago in Britain, Rupert Murdoch was forced to close down his newspaper,
*23:32.540- 23:37.500* :  the news of the world after its journalists were found to have hacked the phones of countless
*23:37.500- 23:43.820* :  celebrities and the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl. His papers have also been accused of distorting
*23:43.820- 23:51.360* :  the news to ensure his political allies won elections. So how will the editorial direction of
*23:51.360- 23:58.020* :  the media empire change under Lachlan Murdoch? A question my colleague, Celia Hatton, put to Stephen
*23:58.020- 24:03.180* :  Maine, who's a former journalist, and the Murdoch tabloids in Australia, and who now describes
*24:03.180- 24:09.140* :  himself as a shareholder activist. Well, I think Lachlan is a bit of a chip off the old block,
*24:09.140- 24:14.100* :  certainly in terms of the politics. So you won't see any change in terms of
*24:14.100- 24:23.000* :  the mega-Republicanism, Fox News, Climate Denialism, those sorts of things. So Rupert wants to
*24:23.000- 24:29.180* :  hand over to someone like him. Lachlan is the only adult child standing, if you like, who is prepared
*24:29.180- 24:35.400* :  to continue on what Rupert has done. But there's only one Rupert Murdoch. So really at one level
*24:35.400- 24:40.560* :  is quite unfair. I think that one of his kids can sit there and become the chairman of two
*24:40.560- 24:48.020* :  enormous global media empires and run it from Sydney, where he's moved back to a couple of years ago.
*24:48.020- 24:53.020* :  So I think it's a bit of a poison cellist for Lachlan, but he wants to be able to prove that he
*24:53.020- 24:57.700* :  can make decisions around the companies without his father sitting there. So I think that he's
*24:57.700- 25:03.980* :  going to have a chance to see who he goes with that dead. If Rupert Murdoch really is in good health
*25:03.980- 25:09.180* :  as he claims and the company claims, do you think he's going to be able to really disentangle
*25:09.180- 25:15.480* :  himself from this empire he's been involved with for most of his life? When his father died in
*25:15.480- 25:21.520* :  1952, he became the chief executive of a public company. And for 70 years, he's either been the
*25:21.520- 25:28.060* :  chief executive or also the chair. Now, in November, he is going to resign from the board of both
*25:28.060- 25:32.440* :  companies. So he's not just going to be a non-executive director or the non-executive chairman,
*25:32.440- 25:38.780* :  he is resigning from the board entirely. So this is a massive change. And I think it'll be
*25:38.780- 25:42.940* :  challenging for Rupert to actually do that. And I think the reason he's probably done this
*25:43.300- 25:50.020* :  is one to give Lachlan a chance to show how he can go. But two, at 92, he's struggling to perform
*25:50.020- 25:54.820* :  those public facing roles. I mean, he didn't want to get cross-examined in court over the
*25:54.820- 26:00.220* :  dominion matter. And they gave 1.2 billion to settle that almost as if to stop this old man
*26:00.580- 26:06.080* :  having to stand up and give evidence for hours and hours on this embarrassing Fox News stolen
*26:06.080- 26:12.660* :  election narrative. So he would have had to front these two AGMs in November. These are public AGMs.
*26:12.660- 26:17.780* :  I've spent three or four hours over 15 meetings asking him questions at AGMs. He doesn't like it.
*26:18.100- 26:23.460* :  That was Stephen Mayne. Next to a discovery that adds to the possibility of life existing
*26:23.460- 26:29.740* :  beyond planet Earth. Astronomers using data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have identified
*26:29.740- 26:37.220* :  carbon dioxide on the icy surface of Jupiter's Moon Europa. The lead researcher Samantha Trumbo,
*26:37.520- 26:44.240* :  who's a planetary scientist at Cornell University in the US, told Wendy Irkarts more about what her
*26:44.240- 26:51.300* :  team had found. Specifically, what we found was carbon dioxide concentrated in regions of young
*26:51.320- 26:57.340* :  disrupted geology, particularly a region called Tara Reggio, which was previously found
*26:57.340- 27:02.880* :  from the Hubble Space Telescope to contain salty material that likely came up from Europa's
*27:02.880- 27:09.500* :  internal liquid water ocean. So the fact that the CO2 is in the same region that tells us
*27:09.740- 27:15.320* :  that the CO2 and the carbon it contains probably also originated in that ocean below.
*27:15.840- 27:20.860* :  And what does that tell us about life on Europa? Well, it doesn't tell us anything directly,
*27:20.900- 27:26.820* :  but it is an important step towards understanding whether Europa's ocean might be habitable,
*27:27.200- 27:32.420* :  having CO2 in Europa's ocean gives us another data point on what that ocean chemistry might be,
*27:32.420- 27:37.580* :  understanding that chemistry is crucial to understanding Europa's potential habitability,
*27:38.060- 27:43.320* :  and of course having CO2 in the ocean means that there's carbon in the ocean. And carbon is a
*27:43.320- 27:49.380* :  biologically essential element. How much of a help was the James Webb telescope in these findings?
*27:49.380- 27:54.940* :  This would not have been possible without the James Webb Space Telescope. We can actually study
*27:54.940- 28:01.780* :  carbon dioxide on Europa from any ground-based observatories because of the CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.
*28:02.120- 28:07.720* :  So we really do have to go to space. JWST opened up the possibility for doing this research,
*28:07.860- 28:14.700* :  and it provided enough spatial resolution to allow us to actually map this across Europa's surface
*28:14.700- 28:19.740* :  and get a geography for the carbon dioxide. So what's next? Are more missions planned?
*28:20.460- 28:25.320* :  Absolutely, there's a lot to look forward to. First of all, we will have additional observations
*28:25.320- 28:30.640* :  of Europa's surface with JWST. Later this year, or maybe the beginning of next year,
*28:30.720- 28:36.060* :  following on from that, we will have NASA's Europa Clipper mission, which is launching in the fall
*28:36.060- 28:41.560* :  of next year, going to explore Europa up close. And then there's the juice mission from the European
*28:41.560- 28:46.940* :  Space Agency, which is going to the Jupiter system as well. We seem to be hearing a lot more about
*28:47.460- 28:53.440* :  life on other planets. But what is the difference between life on Europa and life on other planets?
*28:53.440- 29:00.160* :  What's particularly exciting about the possibility of life on Europa is that it's so close to home.
*29:00.160- 29:05.420* :  We're pretty sure that it has liquid water beneath its surface, more liquid water than
*29:05.420- 29:11.580* :  all of Earth's oceans combined. And so if we could understand whether that environment might
*29:11.580- 29:16.740* :  support life, then we have somewhere in our own solar system where we might be able to answer,
*29:16.740- 29:22.460* :  I think, one of humanity's biggest questions. Samantha Trumbo. Staying with space and a
*29:22.480- 29:28.240* :  NASA mission is due to land in the Utah desert this weekend, with samples from an asteroid,
*29:28.240- 29:35.440* :  which scientists have warned could one day hit Earth. Osiris wrecks gathered rocks and dust from
*29:35.440- 29:41.580* :  the Bennu asteroid surface in 2020. Researchers hope the material can provide vital clues to
*29:41.580- 29:46.960* :  explain the origins of our solar system. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos is waiting with
*29:46.960- 29:52.140* :  a NASA team. The Osiris wrecks capsule will come screaming into Earth's atmosphere on Sunday
*29:52.140- 29:58.200* :  at more than 15 times the speed of a rifle bullet. It'll make a fireball in the skies it does so,
*29:58.200- 30:03.680* :  but a heat shield and parachutes should slow the descent and bring it into a gentle touchdown on
*30:03.680- 30:10.080* :  Department of Defense land. The capsule carries a precious cargo, 250 grams of rocky debris
*30:10.080- 30:15.720* :  grabbed from asteroid Bennu, a mountain-sized space rock that's thought to retain the chemistry
*30:15.720- 30:20.920* :  that existed when the planet's formed four and a half billion years ago. Scientists will handle
*30:20.920- 30:26.340* :  the sample in sterile conditions because it might also contain the type of carbon molecules
*30:26.340- 30:31.840* :  that help seed life. The theory is these could have been delivered to the early Earth by asteroids
*30:31.840- 30:37.600* :  crashing onto its surface. Dante Loretta is the Osiris wrecks missions lead scientist.
*30:38.280- 30:43.400* :  We're addressing profound questions that at some point in our lives everybody asks ourselves
*30:43.400- 30:49.440* :  where did we come from and more importantly are we alone in the universe by understanding how
*30:49.440- 30:54.320* :  the origin of life occurred. We're taking our genealogy all the way back to the original
*30:54.320- 30:59.440* :  organism that we're all related to. It will take a couple of weeks to open the capsule under
*30:59.440- 31:04.780* :  clean conditions with scientists delivering a first take on what's inside in mid-October.
*31:05.280- 31:09.180* :  Jonathan Amos. And that's all from us for now but before we go,
*31:09.420- 31:14.060* :  is Jackie with news of the next edition of The Happy Bodle. Yes, in this edition the extraordinary
*31:14.060- 31:20.620* :  growth of women's football in Saudi Arabia. An enormous undertaking to rewild 2000 white southern
*31:20.620- 31:26.420* :  rhino in Africa. Remember that American cave who had to be rescued from deep underground in Turkey
*31:26.420- 31:30.480* :  after a medical emergency? Well he's out of hospital now and we've been talking to him.
*31:30.820- 31:37.540* :  We'll hear from the creative hotspot for Asian art that is Berlin and the fierce yet oddly
*31:37.540- 31:43.220* :  relaxed competition to be crowned Montenegro's laziest citizen all in The Happy Bodle available
*31:43.220- 31:48.180* :  from Saturday the 23rd of September. And we'll be back with a new edition of The Global News
