00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:12.700:  by Advertising.
00:16.020 - 00:20.020:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
00:20.160 - 00:25.920:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
00:25.920 - 00:30.340:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
00:30.480 - 00:35.260:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad gal as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos
00:35.260 - 00:39.600:  really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars,
00:39.780 - 00:45.300:  listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me Simon Jack, and me Zingsing, available now wherever you get your
00:49.000 - 00:54.500:  podcasts. The captain you know, he went on the radio and he's like, we just want to make sure
00:54.500 - 00:59.100:  everyone knows he has a prolific jumping on the plane. On the podium is back with more
00:59.100 - 01:05.660:  Olympians and Paralympians sharing their remarkable stories. On the podium, listen now wherever you
01:05.660 - 01:13.040:  get your BBC podcasts. Hi, I'm Teresa from the Philippines and you are listening to their happy
01:13.040 - 01:20.320:  pod. Hi, I'm Rihanna and welcome to Happy Pod. Ciao, mi chiamo mattia di Torino. Benvenuti ad
01:20.320 - 01:25.180:  eh, people. This is the happy pod from the BBC World Service.
01:30.860 - 01:35.140:  I'm Jackie Ludd and in this edition uploaded on Saturday, the second of September,
01:35.140 - 01:40.280:  the extraordinary impact of an experimental stem cell treatment for a serious eye injury.
01:40.740 - 01:45.120:  They kept talking about thank you for participating and thank you for doing this for us.
01:45.320 - 01:49.840:  And I told them thank you for doing this for me. They saved my life.
01:50.920 - 01:54.120:  The Italian who saved a little girl as she fell from an apartment block.
01:54.120 - 02:00.700:  I opened my arms, I closed the eyes and I opened to catch her. I don't know how but I did it.
02:00.700 - 02:06.900:  She fell down my chest in my arms. The green tech to help reduce the costs and carbon footprint
02:06.900 - 02:13.200:  of the fishing industry in Southeast Asia. To have the possibility that you can give more to
02:13.200 - 02:20.140:  your folks out there, it's very, very good feeling. Also in this podcast, the feet start moving
02:20.140 - 02:26.260:  and the movement is one, two, three hop, one, two, three hop, one hop, two hop and then there you go
02:26.260 - 02:31.240:  with the sticks. Our political correspondent like you've never heard him before.
02:38.080 - 02:44.680:  Many of us perhaps take our site for granted but fulfilled dust whose 51 and from Alabama in the
02:44.680 - 02:51.740:  US, a life-changing accident left him blind and in terrible pain. Then he was given a ray of hope.
02:51.740 - 02:57.260:  He heard about an experimental procedure to treat cornyers damaged by chemical burns and
02:57.260 - 03:01.380:  other such injuries. Well, hear about the science in a moment. First though,
03:01.800 - 03:06.540:  Phil told us what happened to him. So I was standing in front of a piece of commercial equipment
03:06.940 - 03:13.120:  in the back of a restaurant and the pump built pressures somehow and it squirted right across
03:13.120 - 03:18.640:  my face. It's 27% sodium hydroxide landed pretty hard and heavy and my left eye and a little bit
03:18.640 - 03:23.380:  in my right eye and I was blind and suffering some of the worst pain I've ever felt in my whole life.
03:23.900 - 03:31.740:  And then you volunteered for this trial, for this experimental procedure, volunteering for
03:31.740 - 03:39.360:  something experimental takes courage. What were your thought processes? I couldn't go on doing what
03:39.360 - 03:44.980:  I was doing. I was suffering cluster headaches, migraine headaches one to two a day. I couldn't
03:44.980 - 03:50.760:  leave the house. I was living in the dark. So the thought of the thought of like volunteering and
03:50.760 - 03:57.100:  being brave, I do not have a cape and boots in my closet. I just, I would have done anything
03:57.540 - 04:04.360:  to make this stop. After the actual transplant, my light sensitivity has decreased. I actually
04:04.760 - 04:09.560:  started to see for a while. There was super excited to get to see the big A on the eye chart,
04:09.600 - 04:16.460:  you know, the biggest letter. And my distance vision in my right eye is 20, 25 with glasses on.
04:17.160 - 04:21.600:  So I can drive a car. I can do all sorts of things, but talking about the quality of life and how
04:21.600 - 04:28.860:  life has gone on and how much better it is, I don't have words to describe it. I couldn't go on.
04:29.080 - 04:34.360:  It wasn't just being blind. It was what light did to me. I was walking around with my eyes closed
04:34.360 - 04:39.580:  everywhere I went because there wasn't a pair of sunglasses or shades that could filter the light
04:39.580 - 04:45.520:  enough to give me the relief that I needed in this house. I mean, they kept talking about,
04:45.520 - 04:51.400:  thank you for participating and thank you for doing this for us. And I tell them, thank you for
04:51.400 - 04:56.980:  doing this for me. If not for Dr. Eurikunis recognizing a need for something like this,
04:56.980 - 05:03.900:  what I was going through, I probably wouldn't be here today. And I mean, so after Eurikunis,
05:04.060 - 05:07.840:  do you need me to cut your grass and clean your gutters? Give me a call. I'm on the next plane.
05:07.840 - 05:14.020:  Whatever you want, I will do it. She is, she saved my life. They saved my life.
05:15.380 - 05:20.640:  Well, let's hear now from Dr. Eurikunis from Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who's behind the
05:20.640 - 05:27.560:  knee treatment. This procedure is called calic. It's basically taking a small biopsy of a corneal tissue
05:28.240 - 05:36.280:  from a healthy eye, taking that biopsy to laboratory to cultivate the cells or grow them. And after
05:36.280 - 05:42.080:  making more stem cells, placing them back onto the patient's eye. So there's already another
05:42.080 - 05:47.500:  procedure using stem cells from a healthy eye on an injured one. But this is different, isn't it?
05:47.500 - 05:53.320:  You've improved the system and this one is less risky. Yeah, so currently in the United States,
05:53.320 - 06:01.000:  the most common modality is to actually take the biopsy and directly place it on the diseased eye
06:01.000 - 06:06.600:  without cultivating those stem cells. And a lot of times the risk of that is that you have to take
06:06.600 - 06:14.420:  pre-large biopsies from the healthy eye, putting the healthy eye at risk. And what sorts of eye injury
06:14.420 - 06:20.140:  are we talking about? What sorts of people might this be able to help? It helps various injuries,
06:20.140 - 06:27.260:  but it goes even beyond that. So if there is a patient who has an infection that has depleted
06:27.260 - 06:34.640:  their stem cells, if there is an issue of trauma to the eye or chemical injuries, so anything that
06:34.640 - 06:40.940:  can destroy those stem cells can be actually treated with this procedure. So you've made the
06:40.940 - 06:46.380:  science clear and it has been a really lengthy process to get this far. Tell us about the
06:46.380 - 06:52.900:  patients that you've been working with. It is a really great pleasure and really honor to be
06:52.900 - 06:59.960:  able to do this trial. Because first of all, the patients have entrusted their eye to us.
07:00.520 - 07:07.480:  This trial is a combination of 20 years of work, literally from bench to bedside. So for me,
07:07.480 - 07:14.460:  personally, it's wonderful that the basic research that we were working on is now in humans.
07:15.340 - 07:21.500:  Dr. Ula Yakunas and before that, we heard from Phil Dust. Now to Turin in Italy, which is
07:21.500 - 07:27.740:  celebrating an incredible catch. Matia Agutzi and his girlfriend Gloria were on their way to buy
07:28.080 - 07:33.800:  bread when they heard desperate cries from high above the street. We heard somebody screaming for
07:33.800 - 07:40.520:  the balcony on the other side of the street. Stop, don't move, go back. Looking up, we saw a little
07:40.520 - 07:47.720:  girl at the fifth floor of the building next to us. We started shouting to her to stay back, but she
07:47.720 - 07:53.280:  didn't hear her has. She continued until she was angry just with her small hands to the balcony.
07:53.800 - 07:59.700:  In that moment, I was following her movements. I opened my arms, I closed the eyes, and I
07:59.700 - 08:05.740:  opened to catch her. I don't know how, but I did it. She fell down my chest in my arms. It has
08:05.740 - 08:11.260:  been a strong impact. Both of us fell down the street. I couldn't breathe for a few moments.
08:11.280 - 08:18.660:  Then after a while, she started crying. The worst was over. She was alive. Gloria must be so proud of
08:18.960 - 08:26.440:  you. Yes, yes. She was very, very scared, not only for the baby, but a lot so for me.
08:26.640 - 08:31.680:  Well, yeah, it was a long, full, huge catch. You did fall to the ground. Are you okay?
08:32.540 - 08:37.680:  Yes, yes, I'm okay. I've been at the hospital just for some checks. It's not too late after
08:37.680 - 08:42.980:  now. But after a few hours, I was at home. The strongest impact has been under an emotional point
08:42.980 - 08:48.640:  of view. The following night, I could sleep just a few hours. I started thinking more and more about
08:48.640 - 08:54.660:  what happened, or maybe more about what, fortunately, they didn't happen. I felt like I
08:54.660 - 08:59.580:  have been in a parallel dimension. So many media were calling for interview to get information.
09:00.000 - 09:06.380:  Including me, it must be said. Importantly? Yes. The little girl, is she okay?
09:06.920 - 09:12.140:  Yes, also the baby is fine. On Saturday afternoon, I saw her for a few minutes at the hospital.
09:12.600 - 09:16.740:  She was miling watching cartoons. This is the most important thing for me.
09:17.300 - 09:23.540:  You mentioned the reaction and all the media interest. Tell us a bit more about the things
09:23.540 - 09:27.240:  that you've heard from your family and your friends and social media and famous people.
09:28.380 - 09:33.800:  When I meet my mom, Saturday evening, she gave me a long, crying, full, emotion,
09:34.280 - 09:38.500:  as well as my dad and my sister. I receive many messages from friends,
09:38.500 - 09:44.180:  colleagues, even from people who don't know. The Prime Minister, the Piedmont President,
09:45.140 - 09:50.060:  is important to share the creative with the media, who was the first person to raise the alarm
09:50.060 - 09:56.080:  when he suffered on the balcony. So, you've had this huge emotional reaction from your family
09:56.080 - 10:03.500:  and friends and international interest. What's it like to be a hero? I don't feel like a hero.
10:04.000 - 10:08.880:  I follow with my instinct, hope that anybody else will have done the same.
10:09.700 - 10:14.300:  For me, in that fragment of second, it was the only right thing to do. I always
10:14.300 - 10:18.180:  been a rational person, but now I'm starting to believe in the destiny.
10:19.020 - 10:25.520:  Mathia Aguudzi, hero. Traditional prosthetic limbs can be expensive and often heavy,
10:26.120 - 10:30.520:  and a lot of the places where they're most needed, lack, trained personnel and infrastructure.
10:30.560 - 10:35.780:  Well, one company trying to do something about that is called Koala. It started what proves
10:35.780 - 10:42.280:  to be a successful pilot scheme in Sierra Leone in 2021, and is now working to roll it out nationally.
10:42.940 - 10:47.300:  Founder Nate Macabuegg told us what's different about his prosthetics.
10:47.980 - 10:51.660:  The way we make prosthetics is much more akin to how you might make a trainer or a bit of sports
10:51.660 - 10:55.980:  work, or an item of clothing. So instead of a reasonably mouldy socket, it's soft, flexible,
10:55.980 - 11:00.040:  it's reinforced what it needs to do, but the rest of it is made out of fabrics, and then instead of
11:00.040 - 11:03.640:  really complicated things on the end that are quite heavy and hard to use, we just have simple
11:03.640 - 11:08.200:  tools that clip on and off. You have ones for pens, for playing music, for doing other sports.
11:08.620 - 11:14.360:  Obviously, you've been working in the UK, but you've also been carrying out a pilot project
11:14.360 - 11:19.200:  in Sierra Leone. What took you there? Our chairman at the time had done work in the past,
11:19.500 - 11:24.640:  and he had some contacts out there, and we met an amazing guy from Dr. Absdenvoyer. He was born
11:24.640 - 11:29.200:  with Polio, and he saw what we were making, and was like, guys, that would be so useful here.
11:29.520 - 11:33.580:  So what we kind of realised by making prosthetics like clothes is that you can put in a box
11:33.580 - 11:38.860:  and send them to anywhere in the world. Tell us a little bit about the sort of response that you
11:38.860 - 11:44.300:  have had from recipients. They send videos of doing and doing sports, doing new hobbies,
11:44.880 - 11:48.460:  of trying these things, of doing things that happened in years, and it's like, I wake up to these
11:48.460 - 11:52.380:  every day, that's the most fulfilling thing I could imagine. So in the first time we actually went
11:52.520 - 11:58.700:  to Sierra Leone, which was 2021, we're only there for a week, and we managed to fit about 20
11:58.700 - 12:04.300:  people without the limelocks, which is kind of unheard of. How is that? Very excellent.
12:08.060 - 12:12.240:  They were just happy to see that there were people paying attention, and for us it was amazing,
12:12.240 - 12:16.020:  because it's a completely different culture, but actually what we saw was a lot of the similarities,
12:16.640 - 12:21.000:  like with Sullivan, the other son, and in his thing, he didn't need a forsake for most things,
12:21.000 - 12:25.040:  but when I'm walking my son to school, I can't hold his hand when I'm crossing the road,
12:25.160 - 12:28.800:  and help him carry his school bag, and he said, photos after, they're like, oh, this is great,
12:28.800 - 12:33.380:  this is amazing. So the last thing we did was train the clinicians that make prosthetics in the
12:33.380 - 12:40.380:  country. There's only four, which is about 20, 25,000 amputees in the country, so it shows you
12:40.380 - 12:44.420:  the scale of the mismatch of the problem and the funding. So it's a model that if we get it right
12:44.420 - 12:49.280:  and Sierra Leone can scale to you literally anywhere on the planet. You can't describe that feeling of
12:49.360 - 12:53.700:  being even just a little bit useful to someone else. We were with approaching 1,000 people around the
12:53.700 - 13:00.640:  world. That was Nate Macabewerg from Koala. Now, some of the other things that caught our eye
13:00.640 - 13:07.180:  this week, the magnificent return of Jimnast Simone Biles, who broke a 90-year record by winning her
13:07.180 - 13:12.920:  eights all-round title at the US Gymnastics Championships. Her win came less than a month after
13:12.920 - 13:18.560:  the four-time Olympic champion returned to competition following a two-year break. Her triumph
13:18.560 - 13:24.560:  took her ahead of Alfred Joachim, who claimed his seventh US title in 1933.
13:25.900 - 13:30.920:  Some good news for Atlantic puffins on remote islands off the coast of Maine in the US. They have
13:30.920 - 13:36.000:  had their second consecutive rebound year for fledging chicks after they suffered a catastrophic
13:36.000 - 13:43.020:  2021. It's partly down to the abundance of a fish called the sand lance, allowing puffins to thrive.
13:43.780 - 13:48.520:  Now, you might have heard a report on the Global News podcast about some very eye-catching footage
13:48.520 - 13:53.040:  that emerged this week from Nebraska in the United States. Police there pulled over a man for
13:53.040 - 13:59.820:  driving on a motorway with a huge bull nestled in the passenger seat. Chad Ryman of Norfolk Police
13:59.820 - 14:08.020:  explains. The officers received a call, reference, a car driving into town that had a cow in it.
14:08.260 - 14:11.900:  They thought that it was going to be, you know, like a calf, something smaller, something that
14:11.900 - 14:19.020:  actually fit inside the vehicle. There were some sightable issues with that situation. The officer
14:19.020 - 14:25.500:  chose to write him a warning and ask him to take the animal back home. The car actually had half
14:25.500 - 14:31.080:  its roof cut off in order to fit the animal and its magnificent horns in. You can see the footage
14:31.080 - 14:38.320:  on the US and Canada pages of our website, BBCNews.com. And a winner has been declared for Finland's
14:38.320 - 14:43.360:  ugliest vase. It's a thing, apparently. The winner against tough competition was a shiny gold
14:43.360 - 14:49.960:  vase decorated by a pair of fire-red roses. Second was purple, decorated with golden ornaments and
14:49.960 - 14:56.240:  a sparkling plastic crystal. Third was an unusual combination of a copper pipe and black stiffened
14:56.240 - 15:02.060:  metal chain. If you want to look and why wouldn't you, I will share using the hashtag The Happy Pod.
15:08.180 - 15:12.200:  Still to come in this podcast. I felt like it's a whole new, like,
15:13.180 - 15:21.240:  learning and fun. It's a whole new world. What do you love near old Reese thinks about the new
15:30.580 - 15:34.620:  Braille Lego? Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
15:34.780 - 15:40.700:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they made
15:40.700 - 15:45.740:  their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy. So if you want to
15:45.740 - 15:51.020:  know if Rihanna is as much of a bad gal as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos really did to become
15:51.020 - 15:55.960:  the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars. Listen to Good Bad Billionaire
15:55.960 - 16:00.300:  with me, Simon Jack. And me, Zingsing, available now wherever you get your podcasts.
16:06.260 - 16:11.720:  Unexpected Elements is all about finding the surprising science angles to everyday news.
16:11.980 - 16:17.540:  My absolute good blog. Amazing to me. That's Unexpected Elements from the BBC World Service.
16:17.540 - 16:24.180:  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Now more of your sounds.
16:25.120 - 16:32.600:  Hi there. This is Camilla Cooley from Sydney, Australia. I live next door to a school which at
16:32.740 - 16:41.640:  the 8.38.45.9 o'clock mark of a morning has a sound. It's like letting the children know that
16:41.640 - 16:49.340:  schools are about to begin. And the sound is really quite jarring. It's just meh meh meh.
16:50.200 - 16:57.440:  Really not conducive to children starting out their day at school. And it's not particularly
16:57.440 - 17:04.080:  enjoyable for neighbours like myself. And very recently I noticed that the sound had changed.
17:04.920 - 17:13.840:  And I imagine the reason the sound changed was to consider that we need to be more welcoming to
17:13.840 - 17:20.400:  children as they start their day and to acknowledge that maybe for some groups more than others
17:20.400 - 17:29.060:  a jarring sound can be really off-putting. So this is my sound that makes me happy. Is the switch
17:29.060 - 17:37.460:  from the jarring emergency type alert sound to a really gentle, warm, welcoming, cheerful chime
17:41.840 - 17:49.240:  to set people on their day. And Andrea from Rome sent us this.
17:55.120 - 18:00.560:  That's the sound of crickets when he works out on his bike in the Empty Appia Antica Park.
18:00.560 - 18:08.000:  Thank you Andrea and Camilla. Now subsistence fishing is a huge industry employing hundreds
18:08.000 - 18:13.440:  of millions of people around the world and it also has a huge carbon footprint. Now a team of
18:13.440 - 18:19.140:  scientists is developing a solar power bank to help people in the southeastern fishing industry
18:19.140 - 18:24.200:  reduce their impact on the environment, improve their own health and save money.
18:24.200 - 18:29.360:  Geriza Molina from Shift Tech Marine in the Philippines told us about their project.
18:29.980 - 18:36.000:  These small time-fisher folks usually go out at night so they need the battery so that they can
18:36.000 - 18:41.500:  power the lights that they need. And what they use usually to power those lights are these heavy,
18:41.500 - 18:46.960:  bulky car batteries that are very dangerous as well as they spend a lot on it and then they
18:46.960 - 18:50.800:  can just use it for like a few months and then they need to buy again. And we'll after our
18:50.800 - 18:56.300:  fishermen are not able to use them anymore to throw it away so that's terrible for environment.
18:56.300 - 19:02.380:  So we wanted to help these small time-fisher folks get the most out of their living and then
19:02.380 - 19:09.020:  make it safe for them so they can get home. So that's the problem. What is the solution that you
19:09.020 - 19:16.060:  have come up with? We created a safer and more convenient solar power bank. It works like the
19:16.060 - 19:22.120:  usual power bank but it can be recharged by a solar power. So when fishermen go out into the sea
19:22.120 - 19:27.820:  they can use the power bank to power their lights and right now it lasts around 18 hours and then
19:27.820 - 19:33.600:  in the morning they can use the solar charger to power their power bank and then we are also working
19:33.760 - 19:40.100:  with the wind. So imagine you're in the ocean it's very cloudy. We can use the so wind power to
19:40.100 - 19:47.040:  charge our power bank and it's really affordable so our fishermen spend around 26,000 pesos a year
19:47.120 - 19:54.580:  for their artificial battery but we offer around 10,000 right now. So what sort of impact is it
19:54.580 - 20:00.300:  having on the people who work in this industry and their families? They are getting more fish
20:00.480 - 20:04.980:  out from the sea. That means they can get more income. It's really an amazing thing to hear about
20:04.980 - 20:10.580:  from them. You know, they share that they were able to go to in Mala recently and then to hear that
20:10.580 - 20:15.680:  their child has the goal of becoming a doctor and then thinking that her parents can actually
20:15.680 - 20:21.060:  afford that now. And to be able to think that you already have this impact on such a small family
20:21.060 - 20:27.560:  and then to have the possibility that you can give more to other fisher folks out there and then
20:27.920 - 20:33.360:  maybe more children wanting to become a doctor, engineer, an attorney and you can be a part
20:33.400 - 20:39.880:  of that dream and it's a very, very good feeling that many people should strive for, yeah.
20:40.500 - 20:46.200:  Geriza Melina of Shiftech Marine and you can hear female founders green tech in the blue
20:46.200 - 20:53.260:  economy by searching for the documentary or if you get your BBC podcasts. Lego has been a much
20:53.260 - 20:58.460:  loved toy for more than 90 years and it is still going strong. And after successful trials,
20:58.460 - 21:04.740:  the Danish firm has now released Braille Brics in English and French. The idea is to help blind
21:04.740 - 21:09.800:  children or people who have difficulty seeing learn to read letters and numbers by touch.
21:10.300 - 21:15.440:  Dr Amit Patel, author and disability campaigner told us what's different about the new Lego.
21:16.160 - 21:20.260:  On a standard brick where you might have six little dots to connect are the Lego pieces to
21:20.820 - 21:25.060:  the Braille Brics correlate to the same as you would read out in Braille. So they would have one
21:25.060 - 21:30.820:  dots, three dots, four dots, five dots, but they also have lettering on the bottom actually
21:30.820 - 21:37.000:  printed to tell you what Braille they correspond to. So an A would be top left corner and that's all
21:37.000 - 21:42.600:  you'd have. You just have one tiny little dot. So it's very much to help someone who wants to learn
21:42.600 - 21:48.200:  Braille to be able to put them out and actually feel the dots as opposed to try and feel the little
21:48.200 - 21:55.500:  dots on a piece of paper. Does it still work to build things the way that the original Lego does?
21:56.380 - 22:00.060:  It does and that's the beauty of it. It's still compatible with your original Lego
22:00.500 - 22:04.460:  that you might have lying around or that you play with at home. But the beauty of this is
22:04.660 - 22:09.820:  you kind of learn Braille as you go along. So I've got two young kids who are both into Lego.
22:09.820 - 22:14.420:  They're both sighted. They want to learn Braille because they watch their dad but gets to a point
22:14.420 - 22:19.200:  where they're just bored. So I found that with Lego Braille bricks we can sit down and we can play
22:19.200 - 22:23.480:  but they're actually learning as they go along. So in our household it's a win win.
22:23.780 - 22:31.080:  How important is it for kids who have impaired vision that manufacturers are paying attention
22:31.740 - 22:36.720:  to the sorts of toys and learning devices that they can use and have fun with?
22:37.040 - 22:44.040:  Lego for me is one of those universal games or toys that you can interact with despite having
22:44.040 - 22:48.980:  sight loss and you can play with everybody in the household. So I think manufacturers need to take
22:48.980 - 22:53.960:  notes on when they're producing games, making games to make sure that they're inclusive and there's
22:53.960 - 22:58.800:  a way of being able to play with them with everybody else. What is the most impressive thing you've
22:58.800 - 23:07.360:  ever made from Lego? Oh, we're not when I was a child. It used to be cities and towns but now with
23:07.360 - 23:13.820:  my kids it's more dinosaurs, monsters. Anything that's big and that can you can destroy within a
23:13.820 - 23:20.620:  second? 11-year-old Reese has severe visual impairment and he's been trying out the Braille Lego.
23:21.240 - 23:27.160:  It's so you can play while she's still learning and it teaches other kids like my little sister
23:27.160 - 23:32.800:  that's free she understands it's Lego you build stuff with it but I've taught her that with Lego
23:32.800 - 23:38.900:  Braille bricks she can lay them out and make different words. I felt like it's the whole new
23:38.900 - 23:47.700:  learning and fun is like a whole new world. So you've been trying out this stuff. What sorts of
23:47.700 - 23:55.240:  things have you been making? I have been writing a lot of sentences and I made everyone's name
23:55.640 - 24:05.640:  and I have been using them as normal Lego sometimes. Can build cars houses a lot of different things.
24:06.480 - 24:13.280:  So if you had to give it stars out of five Reese what would your verdict be? If I could go higher
24:13.280 - 24:21.620:  to like 20 but five. And Amanda Reese's mum he obviously is really enjoying it. What's it
24:21.620 - 24:28.300:  like for you as his mum watching him learn this new thing? To be honest all different kinds of
24:28.300 - 24:33.720:  emotions I always obviously feel the pride seeing Reese doing all the different things when it
24:33.720 - 24:39.640:  comes to Braille but it's lovely to see that he's not only learning he is playing at the same time
24:39.640 - 24:44.240:  and as he's doing that he's pointing it out to his sisters and they're picking it up along the way
24:44.240 - 24:53.100:  so it makes you really happy. Reese and his mum Amanda. Now time for another sound. This one
24:53.120 - 24:58.200:  though came to us not from a listener but from our very own political correspondent Rob Watson.
25:06.900 - 25:12.300:  Now Rob has been making the sense of the twists and turns of UK politics for a global audience
25:12.300 - 25:18.620:  for many many years on the BBC World Service and while on holiday he was reminded of our historical
25:18.620 - 25:25.920:  signature theme tune. It used to be the tune that would say aha I am listening to the BBC
25:25.920 - 25:40.380:  World Service wherever you were in the world. It was if you like the BBC World Service's signature tune.
25:41.140 - 25:47.040:  This obviously was not on the BBC World Service this was not that particular rendition. Tell us
25:47.040 - 25:52.940:  about this particular piece of music. Well it was an extraordinary moment so I was on my holidays
25:52.960 - 25:58.140:  in South Devon on the south coast of England I came out of the pub where I was having of course
25:58.140 - 26:02.860:  the traditional fish and chips and an extraordinary sight greeted me so it was a troop of
26:03.200 - 26:07.440:  of Morris dancers and put those of you who's never seen it it's a tradition that dates back to the
26:07.440 - 26:12.560:  mid 15th century. It's people dressed in white they got bells and handkerchiefs and they're doing
26:12.560 - 26:16.860:  this dancers but it wasn't just the dancers I was like hang on a minute I know that tune
26:16.860 - 26:23.900:  and it wasn't instantly recognizable but they could it yet and people Morris dancing to it
26:23.940 - 26:30.140:  I mean it was just an extraordinary sight and I could just feel myself light up inside you know
26:30.140 - 26:34.500:  when you get one of those good feelings I could feel myself sort of smiling and thinking wow
26:34.500 - 26:40.540:  how many of this for a while. Now obviously we normally talk to you about British politics
26:41.340 - 26:49.080:  people might not realise that you have a cultural hinterland as it were you yourself do have
26:49.080 - 26:54.960:  an interest in Morris don't you? Oh my goodness Jackie you've brought it up I once danced I think
26:54.960 - 26:59.540:  you were there you were recording I once did a bit of Morris dancing in the BBC newsroom
26:59.960 - 27:05.220:  everyone must have thought I was mad I do so as I mentioned it's a tradition that that goes back
27:05.220 - 27:10.940:  to the mid 15th century it's sort of went out of fashion in the 19th century as Britain industrialised
27:10.940 - 27:16.400:  but then in places like Oxfordshire where I grew up as a boy it was sort of it was revived
27:16.400 - 27:24.180:  and so amazingly in the 1960s in 70s if you were at a sort of humble state primary school that I
27:24.180 - 27:30.020:  was at for people under 11 you learned how to Morris dance and it was one of the best bits of school
27:30.020 - 27:35.580:  every time I hear that music on Mayday in Oxford or a place like South Devon the feet start moving
27:35.580 - 27:41.940:  and the movement is one two three hop one two three hop one hop two hop and then there you go with
27:41.940 - 27:50.760:  the stick so I can feel my feet moving there really is no end to his talents that's the BBC
27:50.760 - 28:00.160:  Morris dancing correspondent Rob Watson and that's it for us for now remember if you
28:00.160 - 28:04.960:  would like to be part of the happy pod you can email us the sound that brings you joy we would
28:04.960 - 28:09.360:  also love to hear if you have any stories to share that will make us all smile as ever the
28:09.360 - 28:16.340:  address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk this edition was mixed by Alanna Bowles the producers were
28:16.340 - 28:22.500:  Anna Murphy and Tracy Gordon our editor is Karen Martin I'm Jackie Lennard and until next time goodbye
