*01:19.140- 01:22.860* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.820- 01:29.380* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Sunday the 24th of September, these are our
*01:29.380- 01:35.240* :  main stories. What now for the Armenian civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh following Azerbaijan's
*01:35.240- 01:40.740* :  takeover of the disputed territory? Ukraine says Russian Navy commanders were among those
*01:40.800- 01:46.400* :  hit in Friday's missile strike on the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet in occupied Crimea.
*01:48.860- 01:54.480* :  Also in this podcast, the long-term consequences of COVID. What we found was that five months
*01:54.520- 02:00.580* :  after discharge patients who were previously hospitalized were at three times more likely to have
*02:00.580- 02:06.620* :  abnormalities involving multiple organs compared to patients without COVID-19.
*02:07.440- 02:14.960* :  And how is French cinema managing to survive with only one in 50 films covering its production costs?
*02:19.620- 02:24.820* :  It's less than a week since Azerbaijanis forces captured the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh
*02:25.080- 02:29.780* :  in a lightning operation. Since then, there have been increasing concerns for the welfare of
*02:29.780- 02:35.060* :  the territory's ethnic Armenian population. Many of them were displaced in the fighting and have
*02:35.060- 02:40.560* :  taken refuge in the main city, Stepanakert. The local authorities say the terms of a cease-fire
*02:40.560- 02:46.000* :  are being implemented, including the delivery of humanitarian aid and the disarming of Armenian
*02:46.000- 02:52.340* :  separatists. But food and medicine are running low and power cuts are frequent. Media access to
*02:52.340- 02:57.800* :  the region has long been tightly controlled by the authorities, but the BBC has been allowed in
*02:57.800- 03:04.780* :  under the close watch of an Azerbaijan military escort. BBC Russians Olga Ifshina sent us this
*03:04.780- 03:10.060* :  report. This is the first time journalists have been allowed into Karabakh since the start of recent
*03:10.060- 03:16.040* :  hostilities. We are currently in Shusha, a key point in the area. It sits on the mountain which
*03:16.040- 03:22.440* :  overlooks several strategic roads and towns. The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has taken
*03:22.440- 03:28.540* :  tens of thousands of lives. Azerbaijan military has told us that currently in control of Han
*03:28.540- 03:33.860* :  Kendi, which Karabakh Armenians coast Stepanakert and consider the capital, so it's very important.
*03:34.600- 03:40.940* :  However, Azerbaijan has provided no details, no evidence and this is as close as we will allow to go.
*03:41.800- 03:47.340* :  The biggest question now is what happens to Karabakh Armenians who have lived here for several
*03:47.340- 03:52.780* :  decades? And Azerbaijan official has just told me that they will only target armed rebels and they
*03:52.780- 03:58.140* :  are ready to provide security guarantees for the civilians. We are currently conducting
*03:58.140- 04:07.940* :  mine cleaning. We also established camps, temporary camps. In these camps we can provide food,
*04:07.940- 04:16.560* :  water, electricity and also heating up to 1,000 people in each camp. However, there is a lot of
*04:16.560- 04:21.980* :  mistrust on both sides. Destiny of these people is now de facto in a very hands.
*04:22.840- 04:29.580* :  Olga Ivshina, the BBC has also spoken to Serena Shagasyan, a journalist who lives in Stepanakert
*04:29.580- 04:36.880* :  and she says the situation there is dire. The thing is that we can't feel safe for our lives
*04:36.880- 04:44.200* :  in this situation. We can't have any kind of hope if I even want to leave, who will allow me,
*04:44.520- 04:51.240* :  sorry, but I don't believe that this talk about humanitarian corridor which will provide us,
*04:51.760- 04:57.240* :  it's not possible in this condition. Azerbaijan has a great light from this international
*04:57.240- 05:02.760* :  community, from Russian, from UK, from other European countries and of course from US.
*05:03.400- 05:09.140* :  I got more from our caucuses correspondent Rehend Mitri, who is monitoring the situation from Georgia.
*05:10.080- 05:16.440* :  In Stepanakert, Valerie, where most people are concentrated now, I'm talking about thousands of
*05:16.440- 05:23.800* :  people who were displaced by this latest military offensive from Azerbaijan. They are now in Stepanakert
*05:23.800- 05:30.440* :  in basements, in shelters. Some pictures have emerged from Seranush, whose voice we just heard,
*05:30.440- 05:36.260* :  she's managing to post some photographs and those pictures show no electricity, very little food,
*05:36.260- 05:42.660* :  lots of uncertainty, fear and really, really desperate kind of situation for people. Because on
*05:42.660- 05:48.240* :  top of that, there are lots of people who are still missing and the local human rights
*05:48.920- 05:55.680* :  Ombudsman earlier today reported that they have received 600 calls from people who are still
*05:55.680- 06:01.820* :  looking for their relatives, including children. And do we know how many separatists have been
*06:01.820- 06:08.400* :  disarmed and how many remain? Well, the process of disarmament is ongoing. There's no specific
*06:08.400- 06:14.480* :  number of how many were disarmed, but today, as a Bajani Ministry of Defense, published a list
*06:14.580- 06:18.840* :  of military equipment that has been seized so far, so these processes are ongoing.
*06:19.760- 06:25.580* :  Now, there's a US senator, Gary Peters, who has visited the border. He is saying that international
*06:25.620- 06:31.140* :  observers are needed to monitor the situation there. Is there any evidence of that kind of
*06:31.140- 06:37.340* :  international monitoring yet? Not yet, but there are more and more calls for international monitors,
*06:37.340- 06:42.320* :  because of course, there are fears of ethnic cleansing. This is something what Armenia has been
*06:42.320- 06:47.640* :  saying for a long time and given the history of this conflict that three years ago, when
*06:47.640- 06:54.340* :  Armenia, Azerbaijan fought a full-scale war and, you know, we live in a digital age, so horrible
*06:54.340- 07:00.560* :  videos showing the mistreatment of Armenian prisoners of war that was all happening three years ago.
*07:00.560- 07:07.140* :  So, the fears that these atrocities might be repeated are justified, I think.
*07:08.240- 07:13.880* :  Rehan Dabitri. Ukraine has claimed that Russian commanders were among those injured in
*07:13.880- 07:19.080* :  Friday's missile strikes on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in occupied Crimea.
*07:19.080- 07:23.780* :  The head of Ukrainian military intelligence said the attack killed at least nine people.
*07:23.780- 07:28.880* :  Danny Iberhardt has more details. Evidence is building that Russia's naval headquarters
*07:28.880- 07:34.440* :  sustained significant damage. More video footage appears to show a follow-up missile striking
*07:34.440- 07:37.800* :  the already damaged building, causing a large explosion.
*07:41.700- 07:46.660* :  Kirill Obedanov told Voice of America that two Russian generals, including one involved
*07:46.660- 07:52.460* :  in operations in the Zaporizha region, had been badly wounded. Ukraine's special forces say
*07:52.460- 07:56.220* :  the strikes were time to target a meeting of the leadership of the Russian fleet.
*07:57.100- 08:01.920* :  Neither source has provided evidence for their claims, which have not been independently verified.
*08:02.060- 08:07.560* :  The Sevastopol area has come under renewed attack this morning. Russia's top official there
*08:07.560- 08:11.660* :  said debris from a missile shopped down by air defenses had fallen near a pier.
*08:12.300- 08:17.160* :  He's also tried to calm residents, warning people to stop sowing panic and, in his words,
*08:17.660- 08:23.220* :  delighting our enemies. It's clear from his post on social media that some in Sevastopol have had
*08:23.220- 08:30.700* :  problems accessing bomb shelters. Danny Iberhardt, what are the long-term effects of COVID-19?
*08:30.700- 08:37.620* :  The pandemic began three and a half years ago. Now a new study of 259 people who were hospitalized
*08:37.620- 08:42.840* :  with the infection found there were far more likely to show damage to major organs than people
*08:42.840- 08:48.680* :  who never caught it. Professor Betty Rimman of Oxford University is the lead author of the study
*08:48.680- 08:54.100* :  published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine Journal. What we found was that five months
*08:54.120- 08:59.900* :  after discharge, patients who were previously hospitalized were at three times more likely to
*08:59.900- 09:07.560* :  have abnormalities involving multiple organs on MRI compared to patients without COVID-19.
*09:08.000- 09:13.720* :  The biggest impact was seen in the lungs, but we also found abnormalities involving the brain
*09:13.720- 09:20.440* :  and the kidneys. And were these people displaying symptoms of long COVID? And if so, what were they?
*09:21.420- 09:28.200* :  So we did not specifically study patients with long COVID, but we know that approximately 70 percent
*09:28.200- 09:33.620* :  of patients who were previously hospitalized may continue to have ongoing symptoms five months
*09:33.620- 09:38.380* :  from infection. So the majority of our patients were not completely recovered from the infection.
*09:38.940- 09:43.380* :  And I guess one important thing is that many of the things you picked up in these MRI scans
*09:43.520- 09:47.320* :  were without symptoms, so people wouldn't even know they had a problem.
*09:48.100- 09:53.520* :  Yes, that's correct. People could have these changes and not have any symptoms. One organ,
*09:53.520- 09:58.400* :  however, where there was a link was the lung, so if there were changes involving the lung,
*09:58.720- 10:03.300* :  people were more likely to experience chest items and cough. But it was surprising that we couldn't
*10:03.300- 10:08.640* :  see a similar association in other organs. Now these were people, as you say, that were hospitalised,
*10:08.640- 10:14.840* :  so fairly severely ill. What about the many people who were pretty ill at home for several weeks?
*10:15.080- 10:19.260* :  What can you learn from this study of anything about those people?
*10:20.400- 10:24.920* :  It's possible that some of the findings that we're seeing in the post-hospitalised group
*10:25.460- 10:31.160* :  may be seen in a small number of people who did not come into hospital. That said, there have been
*10:31.160- 10:36.280* :  follow-up studies of individuals with long COVID who did not require admission to hospital,
*10:36.800- 10:41.140* :  and these studies have undertaken multi organ MRI scans, and it seems like the pattern of
*10:41.140- 10:45.560* :  changes were different. Those who were required hospitalisation had a higher prevalence of
*10:45.560- 10:51.480* :  long MRI abnormalities. And what are the implications of your findings for health services around
*10:51.480- 10:57.200* :  the world? There are two important implications from our work. The first is that people who continue
*10:57.200- 11:03.320* :  to feel unwell after they were hospitalized from COVID-19 do need a more comprehensive checkup
*11:03.680- 11:08.040* :  where the doctor pays attention not just to the lungs but also to the brain and the kidneys.
*11:08.640- 11:14.960* :  The second is that we have identified some risk factors for multi organ changes and abnormalities,
*11:14.960- 11:21.360* :  and these include older age and comorbidities. So individuals from this vulnerable group should
*11:21.760- 11:27.680* :  stay up to date with the COVID-19 vaccination programme available to them. Do you think the problem
*11:27.680- 11:33.540* :  of long COVID is being underestimated or are we across it? I don't think we have a good
*11:33.960- 11:39.660* :  idea yet of the real burden of long COVID across in the community because of reduced efforts to study
*11:39.660- 11:47.480* :  this. Professor Betty Rabben, think of French films and you may conjure up a vision of Bridget Bardot
*11:47.500- 11:53.720* :  or Alan de Long in all their 1960s glory, but a report by the French body that examines the value
*11:53.720- 11:58.820* :  for money of projects and organisations in receipt of government funding has revealed that just
*11:58.820- 12:04.740* :  2% of present day French films make enough money at the global box office to cover their production
*12:04.740- 12:11.180* :  costs. In fact, the industry survives thanks to generous state subsidies. Adam Sage is the
*12:11.180- 12:17.240* :  Times Paris correspondent and Caroline White asked him when French films really were at their zenith.
*12:30.280- 12:37.840* :  The years of true four, 60s, 70s, maybe the Golden Age, maybe Eric Romer as well in the 1970s, films
*12:37.840- 12:43.960* :  such as their cats on crew or something like that were really the highlights of French cinema.
*12:48.100- 12:52.700* :  Let me see with Alan de Long, I mean these were the films that marked a generation of
*12:52.760- 12:56.060* :  French filmgoers and no doubt outside France as well.
*13:04.500- 13:09.880* :  Our French films losing their magic because it seems from those figures that French cinemagoers
*13:09.880- 13:16.060* :  are not smitten anymore. I mean a few French films are certainly still retain the magic, the last
*13:16.060- 13:21.560* :  Pandore winner at the Cannes Film Festival and at a million shooters doing very well, but an
*13:21.560- 13:27.200* :  increasing number of films are being made a year after year and an increasing number of those
*13:27.200- 13:33.540* :  films are attracting almost no one to see them. We're talking about an awful lot of films that are
*13:33.540- 13:38.380* :  being massively subsidised, that are really not finding a public to watch them. And yet this is
*13:38.380- 13:43.700* :  something that certainly some French film directors have said is a good thing. Yes, that's right.
*13:43.700- 13:49.060* :  I mean this is an exception culture and the cultural exception which is that you have a cinema
*13:49.060- 13:55.280* :  industry that is heavily subsidised that doesn't need to worry about profitability and box office
*13:55.280- 14:01.240* :  the same way that Hollywood does, that can explore intellectual and artistic and cultural piles
*14:01.240- 14:06.680* :  and a lot of people in France in the French cultural sector would say this is a positive thing.
*14:07.020- 14:14.020* :  I mean it is true that the system of subsidies has kept a fairly lively cinema sector going in
*14:14.020- 14:20.200* :  France. When French people go to the cinema they do tend to watch more often French films than say
*14:20.200- 14:25.680* :  the British watch British films or the Italian's Italian films. So that's absolutely true. But there
*14:25.680- 14:30.820* :  is certainly a worry amongst let's say people who are less interested in culture, more interested
*14:30.820- 14:36.260* :  in public finances about the amount of money that is going into the cinema and the amount of
*14:36.260- 14:41.560* :  money that's going into cinema to make films that are really not attracting anyone to speak of.
*14:42.000- 14:45.900* :  And does this worry the French themselves or do they think it is worth it simply to carry on
*14:45.900- 14:49.640* :  producing the films? No, I don't think that French are waking up in the middle of the night
*14:49.640- 14:54.480* :  worrying about this to be honest. It is the headlines in May at the Cannes Film Festival because
*14:54.480- 15:01.580* :  used in Trier who is the director of the winner, Anatomy Jun Shu. She used her acceptance speech to
*15:01.580- 15:07.740* :  say that the French system was being threatened by President Macron's quote unquote neo-liberal
*15:07.740- 15:12.120* :  government. Now I don't see any evidence that it is being threatened or indeed that President
*15:12.120- 15:17.040* :  Macron really has a neo-liberal government but it did put the issue into the news agenda and
*15:17.040- 15:21.220* :  there was a debate about it and the government said nonsense. You're getting lots of money and
*15:21.220- 15:25.320* :  you're being very ungrateful and I think that the number of French people probably grieved with
*15:25.320- 15:31.940* :  that. But then it came and went and no one seriously was saying we should pull the plug from under
*15:31.940- 15:38.080* :  the cinema industry and stop the subsidies they're getting. It's a very, very marginal point of view
*15:44.120- 15:44.580* :  in France.
*15:54.440- 15:58.500* :  And that was Caroline White speaking there to Adam Sage in Paris.
*16:05.000- 16:10.180* :  The 19th Asian Games have been opened by President Xi Jinping in China in front of a stadium
*16:10.180- 16:15.760* :  packed with tens of thousands of spectators. The event which takes place over the next two weeks
*16:15.760- 16:21.240* :  has cost billions of dollars with sporting teams from North Korea, Afghanistan and Syria
*16:21.240- 16:27.320* :  all involved. The BBC's Jason Lee has more details. It's the biggest sporting event in Asia.
*16:27.320- 16:31.140* :  It's sort of like the Olympics of Asia for those who are not familiar with it.
*16:31.480- 16:36.820* :  And the Hangzhou Games this year is also the biggest sporting event hosted by China in more than a decade
*16:36.820- 16:43.040* :  that's because in terms of the scale of the competition it's even bigger than the Winter Olympic Games
*16:43.040- 16:48.500* :  held in Beijing last year in the capital because it was under strict COVID-zero policy then.
*16:48.500- 16:54.740* :  This year more than 12,000 athletes from all 45 national Olympic committees in Asia and the
*16:54.740- 16:59.800* :  Middle East will participate competing in 40 sports. Now these include some of those that
*16:59.800- 17:05.340* :  originated from the region and which are not included in the Olympic Games such as the dragon boat
*17:05.340- 17:10.660* :  racing and the Chinese martial arts will show. It's the first time isn't it in three years that a
*17:10.660- 17:17.520* :  team from North Korea is attending. Why not? Well in recent months we've seen some signs that North
*17:17.520- 17:22.980* :  Korea might be slowly opening up its borders since it sealed them three years ago in wake of the
*17:22.980- 17:28.360* :  pandemic. So last month we saw a group of North Korean tech wonder athletes. We believe them to be
*17:28.360- 17:33.900* :  tech wonder athletes crossing the border into China and this was the first time that Pyongyang sent
*17:33.900- 17:40.180* :  a sports team abroad since 2020. So North Korea sending its athletes to the Hangzhou Games might be
*17:40.180- 17:44.640* :  the continuation of that. Another point I want to highlight is North Korea being one of the most
*17:44.640- 17:51.640* :  isolated countries in the world has been quite keen on sports diplomacy. So by participating the
*17:51.640- 17:56.740* :  Games North Korea might be signaling it's ready to pursue that again and of course Beijing is a
*17:56.740- 18:02.180* :  close ally of North Korea and being neighbors Pyongyang might have thought that there was less political
*18:02.180- 18:07.840* :  as well as logistical pressure to send its team to Hangzhou. Well you brought up politics it's
*18:07.840- 18:12.500* :  interesting looking at the guest list because there are people there are political leaders who
*18:12.500- 18:17.840* :  certainly would not be invited to sporting events like the Olympics would be. Definitely that's
*18:17.840- 18:24.660* :  true. So one notable example is the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It's his first visit to China
*18:24.660- 18:31.000* :  since the war erupted in Syria in 2011 so it's another sign that the Syrian President who's been
*18:31.000- 18:37.100* :  shunned on the world's diplomatic stage for more than a decade might be slowly being welcomed to
*18:37.100- 18:42.320* :  the world stage after he attended the Arab League Summit earlier this year in Saudi Arabia.

*18:47.820- 18:54.700* :  It's exploitation beyond all logic. Women's bodies are reduced to objects that can be rented

*20:13.460- 20:16.800* :  This weekend sees the beginning of the new academic year in Iran,
*20:17.280- 20:19.480* :  but it's been overshadowed by controversy.
*20:20.080- 20:24.640* :  Several teachers organizations have issued statements criticizing the atmosphere in schools
*20:25.040- 20:26.400* :  and the pressure on their members.
*20:27.060- 20:32.080* :  Year after the start of anti-government protests which prompted a violent crackdown by the
*20:32.080- 20:36.920* :  security forces, teachers have also expressed their unhappiness about the alleged poisoning of
*20:36.920- 20:42.340* :  students in schools across the country. I'm at least analyst Sebastian Usher. Tell me more about
*20:42.340- 20:45.760* :  the protests and what's happening in Iran's schools.
*20:46.620- 20:49.720* :  I mean, it's better to say that the younger generation in Iran were really
*20:49.720- 20:54.280* :  before front of the protests, but ones which were set off by the death of a young Iranian
*20:54.280- 20:58.580* :  Kurdish woman, Muster Amini, in the custody of the Miranda police just over a year ago.
*20:58.760- 21:03.700* :  And we've seen in the universities, we've seen a lot of professors have been sacked there,
*21:04.200- 21:07.380* :  a lot of students were barred from attending courses.
*21:07.380- 21:12.480* :  And it seems that that has moved towards schools where much younger pupils,
*21:12.480- 21:18.300* :  as young as 1415, were going out on the streets, lots of young girls who were essentially
*21:18.300- 21:23.260* :  throwing off their headscaps at the height of the protests back in the spring of this year.
*21:23.840- 21:29.100* :  And really making their voices heard, trying to save it, the generation that they're part of,
*21:29.160- 21:34.120* :  no longer accepts for rules and regulations, but have been in place for four decades since the
*21:34.120- 21:40.000* :  Islamic revolution in Iran. Those protests have basically calmed down as far as people going
*21:40.000- 21:44.940* :  out on the streets are concerned. There's still defiance quite widely, but people expressed
*21:44.940- 21:50.880* :  online also to some extent in public by not wearing headscaps. So this is an interesting moment
*21:50.880- 21:57.500* :  in the schools to see just how strongly the authorities will react in this new academic year.
*21:57.740- 22:02.360* :  I mean, I've seen a report that the Minister of Education has said that a very large number
*22:02.360- 22:08.200* :  thousands of school principals are going to be replaced and that they essentially want people
*22:08.200- 22:14.860* :  running the schools who are very much in line with what the authorities believe and in preserving
*22:15.600- 22:19.600* :  the rules and regulations, but have been in place for so long. We've seen a number of teachers
*22:20.360- 22:26.160* :  who have been suspended, some have been arrested. That's not just to do the protests over
*22:26.420- 22:32.420* :  Masa Amini and the controversy over the headscarf. It's also, there have been long running
*22:32.420- 22:38.660* :  strikes by teachers as they have been by other professionals that their living standards are being
*22:38.660- 22:43.980* :  degraded as inflation rises. So, you know, this is a major issue. Add to that also, the school
*22:43.980- 22:48.800* :  poisoning has happened that still haven't been resolved properly. So this will be an interesting
*22:48.800- 22:55.040* :  year to see where this all goes. Sebastian Asher. Initially, a law has been proposed by
*22:55.040- 22:59.560* :  Prime Minister Georgia Maloney's right wing government, which would criminalize people who
*22:59.560- 23:04.420* :  travel abroad to have children with the help of a surrogate. The gay community says it's a
*23:04.420- 23:10.340* :  deliberate attempt to stop same-sex couples having children, but this has been denied. It's likely
*23:10.340- 23:15.920* :  the law will be passed making surrogacy via foreign countries a universal crime as it's known
*23:16.220- 23:20.920* :  initially. That would carry a fine of a million dollars and up to two years in prison.
*23:21.480- 23:24.160* :  Correspondent Sophia Petitza has this report.
*23:32.000- 23:37.160* :  I grew up here in Italy. This is a country where the influence of the Catholic Church has
*23:37.320- 23:44.640* :  always been strong. Gay marriage is illegal and same-sex couples have fewer rights than in most
*23:44.640- 23:51.320* :  of Western Europe. Surrogacy, artificial insemination, all adoption are all against the law here.
*23:51.840- 23:58.160* :  So, if LGBT couples want to have a baby, their only option is to go abroad.
*24:01.380- 24:07.020* :  Like Mauro and Maurizio, they've been together for 20 years. Their twins,
*24:07.040- 24:12.820* :  Giorgio and Luisa, are eight months old. They were born in America through surrogacy.
*24:25.320- 24:32.740* :  What exactly is a universal crime? It's a crime so serious that it's prosecuted even if committed
*24:33.340- 24:39.760* :  abroad, but that is usually human trafficking, pedophilia or war crimes. It seems
*24:40.060- 24:45.300* :  odds that surrogacy, which is legally many countries, would fall under this category.
*24:46.660- 24:52.040* :  I wanted to speak to someone in government about all of this, so I've come to the Italian
*24:52.040- 24:57.000* :  Parliament to meet Karlinavarke, the MP who drafted the surrogacy bill.
*24:57.220- 25:04.060* :  Surrogacy needs to be discouraged and opposed. It's exploitation beyond all logic.
*25:04.520- 25:08.660* :  Women's bodies are reduced to objects that can be rented for nine months.
*25:09.620- 25:14.740* :  I pointed out to her that many see her bill as an attack on the LGBT community.
*25:16.600- 25:23.200* :  Absolutely false. Most people who use surrogacy are heterosexual. This is a law that protects women
*25:23.200- 25:29.860* :  and their dignity. We're on our way to meet two men who are expecting a baby through surrogacy.
*25:30.560- 25:36.040* :  They are really scared of what could happen to them and their baby, so they've asked us not reveal
*25:36.040- 25:43.520* :  their identities. If Karlinavarke's bill is passed before their baby is born, they could face
*25:43.520- 25:50.560* :  severe consequences. It's put a huge strain on them during a conversation, one place the piano,
*25:51.260- 25:59.900* :  while the other one paints. I'm afraid that our child won't have his parents because of their
*25:59.900- 26:11.340* :  parents are in jail. So do you feel like you're having to seek political asylum? Yes, I'm feeling like
*26:11.340- 26:18.320* :  we have to be ready to escape as quick as possible. I've been exiled for having done something which
*26:18.320- 26:26.620* :  is actually normal without exploiting anybody. Exploitation is the accusation often used against
*26:26.620- 26:32.720* :  these couples, but they say they have a great relationship with their surrogate. A few weeks ago,
*26:32.720- 26:38.940* :  she sent them a letter and a teddy bear. Congratulations on your baby boy. We are so grateful you choose
*26:38.940- 26:45.640* :  us to go on this journey with you. This is a very special bear. It was written like a haggit and
*26:45.640- 26:49.940* :  we were like, why should we hagg it? Then we hagged it and there was a found indeed of the heart
*26:49.940- 26:58.580* :  beat. Wow, that's amazing, no? This is a symbol of everything of the journey, so we're not
*26:58.580- 27:07.320* :  doing anything bad. That report by Sophia Bittitsa. In the latter half of the 18th century when he was
*27:07.320- 27:13.480* :  just 13 years of age, Kwabna Atobaka-Gwano was enslaved in what is now a Ghana in West Africa
*27:13.840- 27:18.440* :  and shipped to the Caribbean island of Grenada. He was eventually taken to England where he was
*27:18.440- 27:25.080* :  granted his freedom becoming a campaigner against slavery. Kwabna was baptized in St James's church
*27:25.080- 27:31.860* :  in London almost exactly 250 years ago. To mark the anniversary, the church has unveiled specially
*27:31.860- 27:37.620* :  commissioned paintings in its entrance by an artist from the Caribbean and Martin Benard went along
*27:44.560- 27:48.440* :  to have a look. So I'm in St James's church and Piccadilly in the heart of London.
*27:49.200- 27:55.580* :  St James is a beautiful 17th century church and a haven of peace which was built by the architects
*27:55.580- 28:01.300* :  of Christopher Ren. And I'm with the Trinidadian artist, Chay Lovelace. Chay, tell us about these
*28:01.300- 28:07.480* :  pieces of work that you've done here. The paintings depict a kind of idea of baptism
*28:08.320- 28:15.300* :  using my own environment and experiences as a Trinidadian, somebody in the Caribbean. I've used
*28:15.820- 28:23.180* :  the idea for washing at the river as the first panel. So we see two people actually washing themselves
*28:23.180- 28:29.720* :  in the river and there's some very colorful plants around them leaves and lots of greens and blue
*28:29.720- 28:36.100* :  and turquoise. Yeah, I wanted to bring that to London and into this space. What does the next
*28:36.100- 28:43.120* :  painting show describe it for us? This one is a female figure she submerged underwater swimming.
*28:43.360- 28:52.600* :  She is very calm. Of course, again I saw this immersion in the water as also symbolic of baptism
*28:52.640- 28:59.420* :  but also symbolic of the middle passage across the Atlantic. The third panel I wanted to include
*28:59.420- 29:06.000* :  something that was musical and that involved bodies and movement. I thought the drum actually,
*29:06.000- 29:10.400* :  when I first came to St James Church, there was a drummer and I thought that would be a good
*29:10.840- 29:16.980* :  way to kind of connect with the church as well as connect with the traditions of dance and music
*29:17.620- 29:22.120* :  and moving on to the fourth and final panel. What do we see on that? I wanted this one to be
*29:22.120- 29:28.080* :  devoid of human figures so I wanted it to feel almost like a visitation painting, visiting something
*29:28.080- 29:35.580* :  divine, the hummingbirds and the flora, the coconut trees. They're just this strength and majesty
*29:35.580- 29:44.240* :  of nature I guess. Also the native Trinidadian Indians held as a belief that the spurts of ancestors
*29:44.240- 29:50.440* :  resided in these particular birds. How did it fail when you got this commission? That was very
*29:50.440- 29:58.200* :  moved. Every person of colour especially would connect with the history of the slave trade and the
*29:58.200- 30:04.640* :  story of Africans in that time and we're also joined by the rector of St James's. Hello yes my name's
*30:04.640- 30:12.040* :  Lucy Winkett. Could you tell us a bit more about Ottobar Pugano's life? The only date and time that
*30:12.040- 30:19.280* :  we can ascribe to his life is the 20th of August 1773 which was his baptism here at St James's
*30:19.280- 30:26.820* :  Church Picadilly. He was 16 years old according to the baptism register and he'd been kidnapped aged 13
*30:26.820- 30:32.880* :  from West Africa, traffic to Grenada, worked in a plantation and then was brought here to London
*30:32.880- 30:38.600* :  and was freed. Why did you commission this work? Why did the church commission this work? We
*30:38.600- 30:45.900* :  realised that the 250th anniversary was coming. We also realised that Ottobar Pugano is the least
*30:45.980- 30:52.740* :  well-known of a group of abolitionists in London at that time called the Sons of Africa who
*30:52.740- 30:59.200* :  worked with William Wilberforce who is very well-known and so we thought that one of the best ways to do
*30:59.200- 31:04.760* :  that was to put a plaque in the church which we've done but we also thought that wasn't enough.
*31:04.760- 31:11.140* :  His book is called The Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery and it was published in 1787
*31:12.040- 31:19.440* :  and it's an extraordinary condemnation to the whole practice of slavery so he's the first African
*31:19.440- 31:26.320* :  to call for the total abolition of slavery throughout the world and we wanted to say we must recognise
*31:26.320- 31:32.820* :  our complicity with the past and St James's Church like every other church of our generation would
*31:32.820- 31:38.380* :  have had in its congregation at the time that Pugano is baptized, people who are benefiting from
*31:38.380- 31:44.120* :  the transatlantic slave trade. The Reverend Lucy Winkett ending that report by Martin Venard
*31:45.220- 31:51.420* :  and finally a fishing town in northern Japan has decided on a unique way to shift huge numbers
*31:51.420- 31:58.020* :  of scallops it's unable to export to China because of a seafood import ban. Maureen Hokkaido is
*31:58.020- 32:03.960* :  donating 100,000 portions of the prized shellfish to schools as well Leonardo reports.
*32:04.700- 32:09.020* :  Beijing's Japanese seafood ban brought in after the release of waste water from the wrecked
*32:09.020- 32:14.220* :  Fukushima nuclear plant last month appears to have produced an unlikely beneficiary. Students at
*32:14.220- 32:18.920* :  several schools across Japan are soon to be treated to a taste of fine dining as the prized
*32:18.920- 32:23.360* :  Hokkaido scallops hit their lunch menus. The shellfish have been languishing for a month in
*32:23.360- 32:27.540* :  freezers in the northern town of Modi after the loss of the country's biggest international
*32:27.540- 32:32.440* :  seafood customer. The town plans to use emergency government money to fund the school offer.
*32:32.440- 32:37.000* :  It's just one of many Japanese fishing communities reeling from the blanket Chinese man,
*32:37.000- 32:41.600* :  despite being hundreds of miles away from where the water used to cool the damage reactors at
*32:41.600- 32:46.600* :  Fukushima is slowly being discharged into the sea. Tokyo has announced a package of support
*32:46.600- 32:51.260* :  for fisheries which are also paying high storage costs for their products as they seek new customers
*32:51.260- 32:55.800* :  abroad. The government is continuing to try to convince its neighbours that the UN approved
*32:55.800- 33:01.040* :  Fukushima water release is safe. The Prime Minister from Yorkishita last month released a video
*33:01.040- 33:05.920* :  of himself eating raw fish from near the nuclear plant while the Environment Minister was recently
*33:05.920- 33:10.020* :  photographed on a surfing trip in the area. Will Leonardo reporting?
