*01:47.360- 01:52.040* :  I'm Robin Brant and in the early hours of Thursday, the 21st of September, these are our
*01:52.040- 01:52.740* :  main stories.
*01:53.360- 01:58.420* :  The president of Azerbaijan says his forces have restored the country's sovereignty over
*01:58.420- 02:00.580* :  the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region.
*02:01.200- 02:06.360* :  America's central bank has left interest rates unchanged but has dampened hopes of a rapid
*02:06.360- 02:07.480* :  fall in inflation.
*02:08.140- 02:12.720* :  And Venezuelan troops have seized the country's largest prison, which had been controlled
*02:12.720- 02:14.920* :  for years by a powerful criminal gang.
*02:17.680- 02:22.640* :  Also in his podcast, guess what you can get away with as a new baby name in Australia?
*02:22.960- 02:25.060* :  My jaw hit the floor when I saw the birth certificate.
*02:28.400- 02:33.260* :  We're going to start in the Caucasus, where a hastily agreed ceasefire between Azerbaijan
*02:33.340- 02:38.840* :  and ethnic Armenians in the breakaway enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh appears to be holding.
*02:39.400- 02:45.080* :  In an address to the nation, the Azerbaijani president, Ilam Aliyev, hailed the success of
*02:45.080- 02:48.400* :  his military's offensive, saying sovereignty had been restored.
*02:48.940- 02:53.000* :  He also insisted that he had nothing against the ethnic Armenian population.
*02:55.640- 02:59.880* :  I've said the Armenian population living in Azerbaijan are our citizens.
*03:00.880- 03:06.880* :  To put it simply, Armenian nationalists, war criminals, leaders of Armenia and Karabakh
*03:06.980- 03:13.120* :  took these people hostage, poisoned their brains, despite all the injustices and all the
*03:13.120- 03:15.700* :  crimes committed by the criminal Armenian regime.
*03:16.300- 03:18.220* :  We have never blamed the Armenian people.
*03:18.780- 03:23.400* :  Well, during the 24-hour offensive, Azerbaijanis forces attacked the region with artillery,
*03:23.400- 03:25.460* :  fire, missiles and drones.
*03:25.940- 03:30.920* :  The human rights official said as many as 200 people had been killed and many more injured,
*03:31.400- 03:34.920* :  although the BBC hasn't been able to verify those figures independently.
*03:35.620- 03:40.780* :  Around 100,000 ethnic Armenians live in the enclave and their future is now in doubt,
*03:41.340- 03:42.720* :  with talk of reintegration.
*03:43.180- 03:47.780* :  Our caucuses correspondent, Rehand Dimitri, is following developments and she began by
*03:47.780- 03:49.920* :  telling me more about that TV address.
*03:50.460- 03:57.500* :  He said that all their plans on reintegration of ethnic Armenians will be laid out the
*03:57.500- 04:03.300* :  meeting in the Azerbaijanis city, to which the Karabakh Armenians have agreed.
*04:03.300- 04:08.320* :  It was part of the ceasefire agreement that was assigned earlier today and mediated by
*04:08.320- 04:08.740* :  Russia.
*04:09.380- 04:14.180* :  And President Aliyev kind of finished his speech with kind of shaky his feast and saying,
*04:14.180- 04:16.740* :  Karabakh is Azerbaijan and we will show them.
*04:17.260- 04:18.620* :  We have shown it to everybody.
*04:18.620- 04:19.900* :  It's our sovereign territory.
*04:19.900- 04:27.140* :  So very much kind of marking the victory because what Azerbaijan launched yesterday, what
*04:27.140- 04:34.240* :  it described as anti-terror operation, it really kind of marks the final push by Azerbaijan
*04:34.240- 04:39.320* :  to regain control of all the territories that it lost in the 1990s.
*04:39.520- 04:42.280* :  And just quickly on that ceasefire, I mean, is it holding tonight?
*04:42.780- 04:44.700* :  And secondly, who will police it?
*04:44.700- 04:46.320* :  Who will ensure that it holds?
*04:46.920- 04:50.520* :  It appears to be holding, but there's so much uncertainty.
*04:50.520- 04:56.320* :  We've seen pictures of thousands of people gathering at the airport in the regional capital
*04:56.320- 04:57.140* :  Stepanakert.
*04:57.140- 05:01.760* :  The airport never ever functioned because of the airspace was blocked by Azerbaijan.
*05:02.440- 05:05.920* :  But the situation looks quite desperate for ethnic Armenians.
*05:06.500- 05:11.740* :  And it looks like many of them want to leave the region, but they don't know how.
*05:12.320- 05:14.140* :  Rayhantamitri with her assessment.
*05:14.140- 05:19.800* :  So what now is the future for the 100,000 ethnic Armenians living in the enclave?
*05:20.580- 05:25.520* :  Before the Azerbaijanis president made his victory speech, Rebecca Kesby spoke to David
*05:25.520- 05:30.840* :  Babayan, an advisor to the leadership of Nagorno Karabakh, which is known locally as
*05:30.840- 05:32.140* :  the Artsakh Republic.
*05:32.660- 05:35.140* :  He gave her his understanding of the current situation.
*05:35.880- 05:45.900* :  The battles stopped, but the struggle continues because we have to adopt a very harsh, historical
*05:45.900- 05:47.640* :  decisions about our future.
*05:48.260- 05:50.180* :  You say the struggle continues?
*05:50.320- 05:55.380* :  Have you dissolved the ethnic Armenian administration to which you belong?
*05:55.460- 05:58.960* :  I mean, that was one of the key demands of the Isaris, wasn't it?
*05:59.320- 06:06.260* :  Yes, it's their basic goal, but we have just to meet with them and discuss different issues.
*06:07.000- 06:14.280* :  The general mode of our population is that if there is no other possibility, I mean, if
*06:14.460- 06:22.180* :  everybody actually renowns any help of Artsakh, Republic of Armenia, Russia, the civilized
*06:22.180- 06:27.160* :  community, they are all accepting that we should be part of Azerbaijan.
*06:27.160- 06:32.840* :  And then, it's much better just to leave, to organize the kind of exodus of population
*06:32.880- 06:38.540* :  and biblical exodus, because this is what our population, what our people think.
*06:38.540- 06:46.420* :  This is why when I am talking about historical period and very harsh decisions, I mean exactly
*06:46.420- 06:47.040* :  this way.
*06:47.680- 06:55.540* :  So, at the moment, your administration hasn't decided whether you will dissolve or not until
*06:55.540- 06:58.440* :  you speak directly to the Isaris.
*06:58.820- 07:00.420* :  What are your immediate plans then?
*07:00.420- 07:02.320* :  You're going to stay in Stepanakert.
*07:02.940- 07:06.760* :  Well, first of all, we have to meet and discuss different issues.
*07:07.220- 07:14.200* :  But anyway, our population and our people actually, they, because we are also a democratic state
*07:14.200- 07:21.060* :  and we cannot ignore the will of people who are the sovereigns of democratic states, basically.
*07:21.620- 07:26.720* :  So we have to take into consideration their basic needs and their vision.
*07:27.560- 07:34.560* :  And within that case, I think that we have to adopt indeed a crucial historical decisions
*07:34.560- 07:42.360* :  which will actually shape the destiny of not only Artsakh Armenians, but also the Armenian
*07:42.360- 07:43.400* :  people in general.
*07:43.400- 07:52.220* :  And also, it will bring to a drastic reformating of the geopolitical landscape in transcocuses.
*07:52.880- 07:57.780* :  Are you talking about doing some sort of deal whereby your administration could stay
*07:57.780- 07:58.340* :  in place?
*07:59.220- 08:02.280* :  What kind of assurances would you be looking for?
*08:02.820- 08:09.660* :  Well, first of all, we have to understand that these negotiations should also touch upon
*08:09.660- 08:13.480* :  not only political issues, but also have humanitarian issues.
*08:13.840- 08:20.440* :  We have, for example, could have some bodies of perished soldiers on both sides.
*08:20.800- 08:28.580* :  We will have the issue of electricity supply, humanitarian issues, because Artsakh has been
*08:28.580- 08:32.300* :  under siege and blockade for more than nine months.
*08:32.780- 08:34.480* :  So we have a lot of issues to discuss.
*08:34.960- 08:38.500* :  David Babyan, an advisor to the leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*08:39.340- 08:44.060* :  Now, let's go to New York where both Ukraine and Russia addressed the UN Security Council
*08:44.060- 08:49.320* :  on Wednesday, as President Zelensky condemned Moscow's invasion of his country as criminal.
*08:49.920- 08:54.940* :  Ukraine's leader, who was at the annual gathering in the city, in person for the first time since
*08:54.940- 09:00.280* :  his country was invaded last year, said Russia must be stripped of its power of veto on
*09:00.280- 09:01.200* :  the Security Council.
*09:01.820- 09:06.220* :  President Zelensky said there should instead be a two-thirds majority to take decisions,
*09:06.840- 09:09.980* :  as Russia's veto had made any action to stop the war, impossible.
*09:10.580- 09:16.920* :  Russia will not give up this stolen privilege voluntarily, for the UN General Assembly
*09:16.920- 09:20.180* :  should be given a real power to overcome the veto.
*09:20.960- 09:25.420* :  This will be the first necessary step, but it is impossible to stop the war, because
*09:25.420- 09:27.760* :  all efforts are vetoed by the aggressor.
*09:28.220- 09:32.080* :  A correspondent Netta Tophik is in New York, and she'd listen to the President's speech.
*09:32.680- 09:35.720* :  This was, as he said, the first time he was there, and keep in mind that the council
*09:35.720- 09:40.600* :  has met dozens of times on Ukraine, but there has never been action because of Russia's
*09:40.600- 09:44.600* :  veto, so that's why he focused so much of his comments on that issue.
*09:44.760- 09:48.860* :  But, you know, he also spoke about the fact that people have stopped pinning their hopes
*09:48.860- 09:49.680* :  on the UN.
*09:49.720- 09:54.600* :  He says Ukrainian soldiers are now doing at the expense of their blood, with the UN Security
*09:54.600- 09:59.600* :  Council should do by its vote, that they are the ones upholding the principles of the
*09:59.600- 10:00.380* :  UN Charter.
*10:00.720- 10:05.700* :  So, he really tried to push for nations there who haven't outright condemned Russia to
*10:05.700- 10:10.000* :  say that by arming Ukraine, by supporting sanctions, it means that they were defending
*10:10.000- 10:13.620* :  not just Ukraine, but the entire globe, the UN Charter again.
*10:14.200- 10:17.220* :  So, these were kind of his lobbying efforts here in the council.
*10:17.220- 10:22.440* :  I think more broadly, he is just pushing for reform of the UN system, because that's
*10:22.440- 10:26.360* :  very popular right now here with other nations, and he's using the war in Ukraine as another
*10:26.360- 10:28.920* :  push to put UN reform on the agenda.
*10:29.160- 10:32.440* :  Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also addressed the security council.
*10:32.440- 10:36.020* :  I'm not sure if the two men were actually in the same room at the same time, but what
*10:36.020- 10:37.180* :  did Mr. Lavrov have to say?
*10:37.220- 10:40.340* :  It was a bit of a diplomatic dance there.
*10:40.340- 10:43.400* :  We were waiting to see if there would be any fiery rhetoric between the two.
*10:43.400- 10:46.240* :  They actually made sure they weren't in the room together.
*10:46.300- 10:50.880* :  I think the one little bit of drama was that Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vaseline
*10:50.880- 10:54.980* :  Abenzia, tried to have President Zelensky ejected from the meeting altogether.
*10:55.460- 10:59.180* :  But then Albania's Prime Minister said that they would agree to stop the meeting if Russia
*10:59.480- 11:00.180* :  stopped the war.
*11:00.500- 11:04.380* :  Now, as far as what the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said when he did come into the room
*11:04.380- 11:09.980* :  and President Zelensky left, well, he accused the West of really creating these global tensions.
*11:09.980- 11:14.480* :  He said since the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States and its allies had been meddling
*11:14.480- 11:19.480* :  in Ukraine, trying to bring them over to the West, that ahead of their full-scale invasion,
*11:19.480- 11:21.600* :  although they call it a special military operation.
*11:21.600- 11:28.000* :  He said NATO refused to engage in dialogue to really speak with Russia about their security
*11:28.620- 11:28.640* :  concerns.
*11:28.640- 11:34.660* :  So he defended Russia's invasion, and he defended the use of the veto, saying it's a legitimate
*11:34.660- 11:36.740* :  tool that others at the UN use.
*11:37.180- 11:38.180* :  Neutrophic reporting.
*11:38.180- 11:42.680* :  I'm just going to stay in the U.S., where America's central bank has kept its key interest
*11:42.720- 11:43.760* :  rate unchanged.
*11:44.520- 11:48.160* :  But it's forecasted another rise by the end of this year to help tackle inflation.
*11:48.160- 11:53.760* :  The U.S. Federal Reserve said it still had a long way to go in lowering inflation sustainably.
*11:54.220- 11:55.380* :  Michelle Flurries in New York.
*11:55.880- 12:00.260* :  The U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates steady between five and a quarter and five
*12:00.260- 12:04.600* :  and a half percent, but indicated its fight against inflation isn't over.
*12:05.260- 12:09.460* :  Officials at America's central bank signaled that they are prepared to hike one more time
*12:09.460- 12:11.780* :  this year and hold rates higher for longer.
*12:12.240- 12:15.960* :  Central bankers now project higher growth and lower unemployment for next year.
*12:16.460- 12:19.780* :  If they're right, the U.S. will have avoided a long feared recession.
*12:20.260- 12:24.300* :  The Fed began lifting interest rates from near zero in March 2022.
*12:25.120- 12:29.560* :  Here in the UK, the Prime Minister has announced a major shift in the country's pace of cutting
*12:29.560- 12:30.440* :  carbon emissions.
*12:31.200- 12:35.940* :  With a general election expected next year, Rishi Sunak said he was softening policies
*12:36.520- 12:41.440* :  that would phase out buying new diesel cars by 2030 or force people to replace their
*12:41.440- 12:42.660* :  domestic gas boilers.
*12:43.100- 12:47.720* :  Mr Sunak insisted, though, that the world's sixth largest economy will still aim to hit
*12:47.720- 12:50.640* :  its target of net zero emissions by 2050.
*12:51.360- 12:55.560* :  It was only two years ago that the government, under a different Prime Minister, championed
*12:55.560- 12:57.760* :  a so-called green industrial revolution.
*12:58.280- 13:01.400* :  This was Rishi Sunak in Downing Street, explaining his about turn.
*13:02.060- 13:06.840* :  The debate about how we get to net zero has thrown up a range of worrying proposals,
*13:07.420- 13:11.820* :  and today I want to confirm that under this government, they will never happen.
*13:12.380- 13:17.800* :  The proposal to make you change your diet and harm British farmers by taxing meat, or
*13:17.800- 13:21.040* :  to create new taxes to discourage flying or going on holiday.
*13:21.920- 13:26.680* :  I've scrapped those two, and nor will we ban new oil and gas in the North Sea, which
*13:26.680- 13:31.820* :  would simply leave us reliant on expensive, imported energy from foreign dictators like
*13:31.840- 13:32.220* :  Putin.
*13:32.780- 13:38.040* :  Well, I sat down with our climate editor, Justin Rolatt, to get his assessment of Wednesday's
*13:38.040- 13:38.520* :  announcements.
*13:39.240- 13:42.460* :  There were certainly more tweaks to some of the targets that the government has made,
*13:43.060- 13:44.980* :  some of the more significant than others.
*13:45.060- 13:50.900* :  He says he's going to stick by the 2050 net zero target, and the really ambitious target
*13:50.900- 13:56.040* :  for cutting emissions by 2030, 68% target by 2030, he says he hopes to achieve that.
*13:56.260- 14:00.880* :  What struck me was, I mean, there was a big change in terms of the cars, getting rid of
*14:00.880- 14:07.460* :  the 2030 target is quite a big deal, and is likely to slow consumer take-up of a technology.
*14:07.580- 14:12.700* :  I was slightly confounded by that, I was quite surprised by it, because actually sales
*14:12.700- 14:17.140* :  of electric vehicles in Britain are outperforming the expectations both of the industry and of
*14:17.140- 14:18.820* :  the climate change committee and of the government.
*14:19.240- 14:22.740* :  So we're doing quite well, and he kind of acknowledged that in the speech and said, you know,
*14:22.740- 14:26.720* :  like the technology is becoming increasingly persuasive, and we expect people will take
*14:26.720- 14:29.120* :  up those cars of their own choice, we're just not going to force you.
*14:29.460- 14:33.280* :  Well, we heard howls of complaint from the car industry when it was rumoured that he
*14:33.280- 14:34.040* :  was going to do this.
*14:34.280- 14:38.960* :  They said, look, we want certainty, it helps us if we have a ban, because we're investing
*14:38.960- 14:43.840* :  hundreds of millions of pounds on changing, re-tooling our factories to make electric vehicles,
*14:43.840- 14:46.260* :  and we want to be certain there's a market in the future.
*14:46.580- 14:50.720* :  There's always an interplay isn't there of international commitments and domestic politics
*14:50.720- 14:53.840* :  for any politician elected in a democratic system.
*14:54.400- 15:00.800* :  Do you think this announcement today is going to affect perceptions in those key capitals?
*15:00.860- 15:06.500* :  They jean and deli when Rishi Sunak sits down opposite those leaders, and they say, well,
*15:06.660- 15:09.380* :  look, on the one hand, you're saying this, pressuring us, but on the other hand, you're
*15:09.380- 15:10.040* :  announcing this.
*15:10.180- 15:13.420* :  Boris Johnson says the UK is a leader in cutting carbon.
*15:13.420- 15:18.800* :  It certainly has been, you know, we've cut carbon by almost 50% on 1990 levels by last
*15:18.860- 15:19.260* :  year.
*15:19.700- 15:23.640* :  That exceeded the kind of carbon cuts achieved by the countries, which is what the Prime
*15:23.640- 15:24.320* :  Minister said.
*15:24.660- 15:28.320* :  That does give you a certain amount of diplomatic heft when you sit down and try and persuade
*15:28.320- 15:29.820* :  other countries to change their behaviour.
*15:30.240- 15:31.260* :  It certainly weakens them.
*15:31.480- 15:31.940* :  I do wonder.
*15:31.940- 15:37.580* :  I'm not sure how much in Europe, China would be persuaded by the effort of Britain to change
*15:37.580- 15:41.860* :  their behaviour, but smaller countries, you know, we did have influence, and I suspect
*15:41.860- 15:46.140* :  that this will kind of make it a little bit less persuasive that, you know, for example,
*15:46.420- 15:50.160* :  and obviously the commitment to oil and gas in the North Sea, you know, we're saying
*15:50.160- 15:53.060* :  to some African countries, please don't develop your oil reserves.
*15:53.060- 15:54.180* :  They're much poorer than us.
*15:54.180- 15:59.580* :  They've had the benefits of a long industrial revolution, and obviously, you know, it makes
*15:59.580- 16:00.200* :  it even harder.
*16:00.200- 16:00.920* :  I mean, it's tough arguing.
*16:01.140- 16:05.980* :  Anyway, it makes it even harder if we're sucking out the last bits of oil from oil and
*16:05.980- 16:07.120* :  gas from our reserves.
*16:07.120- 16:10.220* :  So I think, yeah, it does make it trickier in international negotiations.
*16:10.240- 16:13.520* :  It does kind of weaken Britain's, if you like, moral authority.
*16:14.380- 16:16.380* :  The BBC's climate editor Justin Rowlett.
*16:17.340- 16:21.500* :  Archaeologists say their discovery of a wooden structure that's almost half a million
*16:21.500- 16:24.900* :  years old could change our understanding of early human life.
*16:25.440- 16:30.380* :  Ant-logs that are carved and overlapping were unearthed from the banks of a river in
*16:30.380- 16:30.840* :  Zambia.
*16:31.080- 16:36.280* :  The research by teams from Liverpool and Aberystwyth universities here in the UK, published in
*16:36.280- 16:40.540* :  the journal Nature, suggest Stone Age people built what may have been shelters.
*16:41.100- 16:43.040* :  Here's our science correspondent for ToryGill.
*16:43.760- 16:49.000* :  Prehistoric wooden artefacts are rare, because wood rocks away, but at this site, pieces
*16:49.000- 16:50.780* :  of wood were trapped in a riverbed.
*16:50.780- 16:53.320* :  Water logs in essentially pickled for millennia.
*16:54.020- 16:58.940* :  It's found tools, including wedges and tapered digging sticks, but most significant were
*16:58.940- 17:03.540* :  two large logs laid out at right angles to each other, as Professor Jeff Duller from the
*17:03.540- 17:05.140* :  University of Aberystwyth explains.
*17:05.520- 17:10.640* :  One's lying over the other, and both pieces of wood have had notches cut into them, and
*17:10.640- 17:15.640* :  you can clearly see that there's notches have been cut by stone tools, and it makes the
*17:15.640- 17:21.020* :  two logs fit together and allows these to become structural objects, and that's really
*17:21.020- 17:24.100* :  exciting to think that at this time people were building structures.
*17:24.400- 17:28.680* :  Dating layers of sediment grains the wood was buried in revealed that the timber was about
*17:28.680- 17:31.200* :  476,000 years old.
*17:31.600- 17:35.400* :  The smaller log is a metre and a half long, so the structure these ancient people were
*17:35.400- 17:39.400* :  building is likely to have been substantial, perhaps a platform or a shelter.
*17:40.020- 17:43.760* :  The researchers didn't find bones at the site, so they don't know what species of early
*17:43.760- 17:45.060* :  human made the structure.
*17:45.480- 17:50.660* :  These logs are much older than the earliest modern human or homosapian fossils, but Professor
*17:50.660- 17:52.960* :  Duller says that doesn't rule out our own species.
*17:53.400- 17:58.160* :  It's possible it is homosapians, and we just haven't discovered fossils from that age,
*17:58.500- 18:02.440* :  but equally it could be homo-ectors, homo-nelledi, and there were a number of homo-nelled
*18:02.460- 18:04.380* :  species at that time in southern Africa.
*18:04.680- 18:07.380* :  The wood was brought to the UK for analysis and preservation.
*18:07.700- 18:12.000* :  It's stored in tanks that mimic the water logging that preserved it so beautifully for half
*18:12.000- 18:16.980* :  a million years, but it'll soon be returned to a museum collection in Zambia to go on display.
*18:17.620- 18:18.600* :  Victoria Gill reporting.
*18:21.640- 18:22.340* :  Well, still to come.
*18:22.660- 18:23.220* :  Getting things.
*18:23.800- 18:24.420* :  That's all you want.
*18:24.900- 18:28.440* :  It's a pretty cheap government to own around you and say, you prove it.
*18:29.080- 18:34.580* :  Veterans who took part in British nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 60s are attempting
*18:34.580- 18:36.640* :  to relaunch a battle for compensation.

*19:29.440- 19:33.560* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*19:33.560- 19:36.820* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*19:57.660- 19:59.380* :  We are in the midst of a climate crisis.
*19:59.540- 20:01.840* :  The climate question speaks to those hit the hardest.
*20:01.840- 20:05.440* :  The problems caused by deforestation and the environment are huge.
*20:05.680- 20:06.420* :  We end big trouble.
*20:06.520- 20:09.480* :  It asks what we can do to soften the impact for the future.
*20:09.480- 20:12.260* :  We do hope the means to do something about this.
*20:12.420- 20:14.840* :  Try and reduce a relative bus or fuel.
*20:15.180- 20:16.760* :  Way more wind and solar.
*20:16.880- 20:18.860* :  I do have a lot of faith for the future.
*20:19.000- 20:21.380* :  The climate question from the BBC World Service.

*20:25.700- 20:27.400* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*20:28.140- 20:30.980* :  Now, a massive security operation has taken place in Venezuela
*20:30.980- 20:34.820* :  to seize back control of one of the country's most notorious prisons.
*20:35.580- 20:39.460* :  More than 11,000 soldiers and police officers were involved.
*20:39.820- 20:44.000* :  Targeting gangs in the Toccaron prison in the northern state of Aragua.
*20:44.380- 20:46.440* :  The authorities say they are now in control.
*20:46.980- 20:48.760* :  I hope more about the security operation
*20:48.760- 20:51.600* :  from our America's regional editor, Leonardo Rocha.
*20:51.880- 20:54.460* :  The government says it was a resounding success
*20:54.460- 20:59.180* :  that they've managed to take control of the compounds after several hours.
*20:59.540- 21:03.320* :  There was footage online and some footage released by the government
*21:03.320- 21:05.700* :  showing flames inside.
*21:05.700- 21:07.760* :  But there was no information of casualties.
*21:08.360- 21:10.940* :  Apparently, what happened is the gang leaders
*21:10.940- 21:15.380* :  that control this compound is a quite powerful gang in Venezuela.
*21:16.040- 21:17.880* :  They escaped when they saw them coming.
*21:17.880- 21:21.420* :  So it's 11,000 soldiers and police involved in the operation.
*21:21.420- 21:25.220* :  The government described that there's phase one of the operation,
*21:25.220- 21:30.360* :  regain control, transferring all the 6,000 inmates to other facilities.
*21:30.920- 21:36.500* :  And the phase two will be to go after these gang leaders in to arrest them.
*21:36.580- 21:39.920* :  Just to clarify, so some of these gang leaders have managed to escape
*21:39.920- 21:42.620* :  from the prison itself, or do you mean within the prison?
*21:42.960- 21:45.560* :  From the prison, because that prison was basically
*21:45.560- 21:48.380* :  from what the accounts that people had in Venezuela
*21:49.020- 21:51.480* :  is that people just came in and out as they wanted it.
*21:51.560- 21:56.080* :  For example, many of their prisoners lived with their families there,
*21:56.080- 21:58.260* :  with their wives and children inside the prison.
*21:58.820- 22:00.560* :  It's a surreal scenario.
*22:00.960- 22:06.620* :  They had this prison head of swimming pool, nightclub, gambling areas
*22:06.620- 22:08.940* :  and all sorts of facilities in there.
*22:09.320- 22:12.020* :  And what happens is the gangs took over control.
*22:12.020- 22:16.380* :  They charged protection money, basically extorting all prisoners.
*22:17.020- 22:18.800* :  And they provided the services.
*22:18.800- 22:22.100* :  Basically, the state left abandoned the prison.
*22:22.100- 22:25.460* :  And it happened in many other prisons across Venezuela.
*22:25.460- 22:28.840* :  So when they saw that the operation was coming,
*22:28.840- 22:33.260* :  in force, in thousands of people coming to break into the prison,
*22:33.260- 22:34.520* :  they just left the escape.
*22:34.960- 22:37.500* :  Now, let's talk a little bit about the prisoners themselves
*22:37.540- 22:40.940* :  and how bad, frankly, some of these people really are
*22:40.980- 22:43.680* :  in terms of Venezuela's gang culture
*22:43.680- 22:46.380* :  and how influential they are in the country.
*22:46.640- 22:50.460* :  Well, there is interesting links between the gangs and politicians,
*22:51.100- 22:53.680* :  many recordings of groups inside prisons,
*22:54.360- 22:57.920* :  chanting political songs and supporting this or that candidate.
*22:58.540- 22:59.900* :  It's a very strange mix.
*23:00.080- 23:01.840* :  This gang is quite powerful.
*23:02.320- 23:03.740* :  It's known as Alagua Train.
*23:03.780- 23:09.040* :  And they operate across Venezuela with racketeering prostitution,
*23:09.500- 23:10.620* :  illegal gold mining.
*23:10.620- 23:13.060* :  And it was all controlled from inside the prisons.
*23:13.520- 23:17.920* :  All prisons in Venezuela are in an awful state and overcrowded.
*23:17.920- 23:21.180* :  The government has been talking about prison reform for a long time
*23:21.180- 23:22.120* :  but it hasn't happened.
*23:22.700- 23:23.700* :  Leonardo Rotsha.
*23:24.040- 23:27.260* :  Next to Myanmar, where at least 30 people have died
*23:27.260- 23:28.500* :  and dozens are missing,
*23:28.540- 23:32.340* :  after a military cargo boat sank in the north of the country.
*23:32.940- 23:35.080* :  The Chindwin River, where the boat capsized,
*23:35.080- 23:39.220* :  has become a critical transport route since the 2021 coup
*23:39.880- 23:42.120* :  but monsoon rains have made it treacherous.
*23:42.660- 23:45.020* :  Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head reports.
*23:45.960- 23:48.020* :  The boat was in a convoy of 11 vessels,
*23:48.020- 23:50.940* :  which local people say had been regularly moving
*23:50.940- 23:52.660* :  along this part of the Chindwin River
*23:53.120- 23:55.160* :  to supply military posts further north.
*23:55.820- 23:57.460* :  It had just taken on more passengers
*23:57.460- 23:59.760* :  when it was caught in a powerful eddie
*23:59.760- 24:02.260* :  in the rain, swollen river, and capsized.
*24:02.880- 24:06.480* :  I witnesses say they believe there were around 100 people on board,
*24:07.040- 24:09.500* :  including soldiers and teachers and students
*24:09.500- 24:11.060* :  from pro-military communities
*24:11.060- 24:13.340* :  who wanted to reach the city of Manewa.
*24:13.880- 24:16.480* :  The Chindwin has always been an important transport route
*24:16.480- 24:17.180* :  in this region,
*24:17.680- 24:18.880* :  but since the Civil War,
*24:18.880- 24:21.000* :  ignited by the coup in 2021,
*24:21.180- 24:23.940* :  it's become a vital supply line for the military
*24:23.940- 24:26.980* :  as road convoys are often ambushed or mined
*24:26.980- 24:30.640* :  by insurgents from the people's defense forces or PDFs.
*24:31.240- 24:33.840* :  The river convoys are frequently fired upon,
*24:34.240- 24:36.780* :  but in this case PDF sources have told the BBC
*24:36.780- 24:39.240* :  that there was no shooting before the accident.
*24:40.020- 24:42.660* :  This is the peak of the monsoon rain season in Myanmar
*24:43.120- 24:44.640* :  when river currents are at their strongest
*24:44.640- 24:46.400* :  and most difficult to navigate.
*24:46.940- 24:47.860* :  Jonathan Head reporting.
*24:48.500- 24:50.900* :  Here in the UK, veterans who took part
*24:50.900- 24:54.800* :  in the country's nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 60s
*24:55.200- 24:58.000* :  are attempting to relaunch a battle for compensation,
*24:58.540- 25:00.520* :  a decade after being legally blocked
*25:00.520- 25:01.800* :  from suing the government.
*25:02.420- 25:04.280* :  Campaigners say newly discovered documents
*25:04.280- 25:07.420* :  suggest that military officers may have had suspicions.
*25:07.820- 25:09.980* :  The personnel suffered radioactive damage,
*25:10.580- 25:14.100* :  more than 22,000 military staff worked on detonations
*25:14.100- 25:15.900* :  in Australia and the South Pacific.
*25:16.600- 25:19.080* :  Here's our home affairs correspondent Dominic Cassiani.
*25:19.800- 25:22.500* :  For decades, personnel who witnessed the nuclear bomb tests
*25:22.520- 25:25.800* :  in the 1950s and 60s have believed that later illnesses
*25:26.280- 25:28.860* :  including cancer and birth defects in their children
*25:29.200- 25:30.760* :  could be blamed on radiation damage.
*25:31.300- 25:33.780* :  There were virtually no safety precautions on the ground,
*25:33.780- 25:36.700* :  some planes even flew through the mushroom clouds.
*25:37.400- 25:40.640* :  Judges told the men in 2012 they had run out of time to sue,
*25:41.080- 25:42.480* :  but recently discovered documents
*25:42.480- 25:44.960* :  have convinced campaigners they have another chance.
*25:44.960- 25:47.600* :  The file suggests military chiefs kept blood
*25:47.600- 25:49.580* :  and urine records in secret archives
*25:49.580- 25:51.960* :  tracking the health of the bomb test witnesses.
*25:52.440- 25:54.460* :  Eric Barton and other members of the campaign
*25:54.460- 25:56.180* :  are determined to go back to court.
*25:56.700- 26:00.440* :  Now aged 82, he witnessed six nuclear bomb tests
*26:00.740- 26:03.620* :  and is appalled at how he and his comrades have been treated.
*26:03.920- 26:05.700* :  Getting pigs, that's all they want.
*26:06.200- 26:08.220* :  The British chief government turned around to say,
*26:08.980- 26:09.800* :  you prove it.
*26:10.440- 26:13.060* :  We are finding documents that are proving
*26:14.020- 26:15.380* :  that the government have been lying
*26:15.900- 26:17.480* :  and they're covering everything up.
*26:17.740- 26:19.780* :  The government says there's no link between the tests
*26:19.780- 26:22.260* :  and ill health and says individual medical records
*26:22.260- 26:23.660* :  have always been accessible.
*26:24.060- 26:26.860* :  Steve Purse's late father was present at tests
*26:27.160- 26:28.760* :  and he was later born with disabilities.
*26:29.340- 26:32.240* :  He's been denied access to his father's blood tests
*26:32.680- 26:35.320* :  and wants to know if radiation caused genetic damage
*26:35.800- 26:37.000* :  passed to him in the womb.
*26:37.180- 26:38.660* :  We know he was exposed to radiation
*26:39.060- 26:40.660* :  and I have obvious disabilities.
*26:41.460- 26:42.420* :  What was he exposed to?
*26:42.420- 26:44.700* :  Because my condition is actually undiagnosed.
*26:45.180- 26:47.840* :  Having access to these medical records and blood samples,
*26:48.220- 26:50.500* :  my help was determined whether that is the case.
*26:50.620- 26:52.860* :  From today, the campaign group aims to sign up
*26:52.860- 26:55.300* :  as many as 1,500 surviving veterans
*26:55.300- 26:58.020* :  for the planned court case, the Ministry of Defence,
*26:58.020- 27:00.940* :  so that it couldn't comment on potential legal action.
*27:01.420- 27:02.200* :  Dominic Cassiani.
*27:02.800- 27:04.280* :  Now, many journalists around the world
*27:04.280- 27:06.660* :  have to work in dangerous conflict zones
*27:06.660- 27:09.560* :  very far away from the comforts of the kind of studio
*27:10.040- 27:11.280* :  I'm sitting in right now.
*27:11.960- 27:13.480* :  But here in London, the frontline club
*27:13.520- 27:15.720* :  was formed 20 years ago on Wednesday
*27:15.720- 27:18.720* :  to support such reporters and camera operators
*27:19.180- 27:20.780* :  who work under life-threatening conditions.
*27:21.360- 27:22.980* :  The founder of that club, Vaughn Smith,
*27:22.980- 27:25.800* :  has warned that it is now more dangerous than ever
*27:26.080- 27:28.500* :  to be a journalist working in areas like that.
*27:29.120- 27:31.400* :  And he's urged news organisations to do more
*27:31.400- 27:33.580* :  to protect the foreign journalists on the ground
*27:33.620- 27:35.200* :  who assist their reporters.
*27:35.800- 27:38.220* :  James Kummerosami had a look around the frontline club.
*27:39.060- 27:41.320* :  The room you're in at the moment is the clubroom,
*27:41.940- 27:44.160* :  kind of got a particular look and feel, I think.
*27:44.160- 27:49.100* :  The walls are covered in wood, which was the original flooring,
*27:49.260- 27:51.060* :  which I've been here quite a few times.
*27:51.060- 27:52.560* :  I'd never twigged.
*27:53.680- 27:55.500* :  Yeah, well, it was us trying to save money.
*27:55.500- 27:58.420* :  And actually, the pine walls look quite interesting,
*27:58.980- 28:00.520* :  and it sort of gives a hint of something
*28:00.520- 28:02.160* :  I saw out in the Balkans.
*28:02.280- 28:03.140* :  We were really started.
*28:03.140- 28:05.800* :  Our community, our original community was from the Balkans.
*28:06.460- 28:09.700* :  The revolts of Bosnia's Serbs became a full-scale siege
*28:09.700- 28:13.580* :  of Sarajevo sites which Europe had not seen for nearly 50 years
*28:14.140- 28:17.280* :  were only the most visible evidence of ethnic cleansing.
*28:18.300- 28:19.680* :  You don't really get war stories,
*28:20.340- 28:22.640* :  because there's always someone who's got a better one.
*28:22.900- 28:24.480* :  Also, at the same time, when we started,
*28:24.540- 28:28.500* :  that we became much more aware of the post-traumatic stress
*28:28.500- 28:30.780* :  disorder problems that journalists were often having.
*28:31.040- 28:33.560* :  And it's clear that one of the things you can do about that
*28:33.980- 28:36.560* :  is engage socially with people who've had a rough time.
*28:36.760- 28:38.840* :  It was a very healthy thing to be with the people
*28:39.280- 28:41.600* :  who have done similar things to help you ease back.
*28:41.660- 28:46.440* :  There are memorials here, and I see memorial here to Rory.
*28:47.780- 28:50.680* :  Rory Pek, a British journalist who was killed in Moscow,
*28:51.360- 28:53.660* :  covering the October coup in 1993.
*28:54.880- 28:57.120* :  Rory Pek was one of the original four,
*28:57.660- 28:59.680* :  you know, half of the people who joined the agency
*28:59.680- 29:01.160* :  were killed in the course of their work.
*29:01.160- 29:03.460* :  And it was tragic, and it got a little bit too much
*29:03.460- 29:04.160* :  for me to bear.
*29:04.720- 29:07.060* :  I opened the frontline club really because I felt
*29:07.060- 29:10.760* :  that as freelancers, we'd made quite a contribution.
*29:12.320- 29:14.200* :  But we hadn't really fitted into the industry,
*29:14.720- 29:17.400* :  and weren't always treated as well as a hat
*29:17.400- 29:18.360* :  we should have been in.
*29:18.540- 29:20.320* :  So this is the memorials of the eight who were killed.
*29:20.580- 29:23.440* :  It's very important to me that they're still here
*29:23.780- 29:24.300* :  beside the bar.
*29:24.660- 29:26.640* :  That's very much the origin of the club,
*29:26.680- 29:27.860* :  because I felt I had a huge responsibility
*29:27.860- 29:29.140* :  because we were all in it together.
*29:29.440- 29:32.940* :  Who were the most interesting people that have stayed here?
*29:33.280- 29:35.660* :  We did have somebody who's extremely controversial
*29:35.660- 29:37.440* :  called Julian Sarge, come and stay here.
*29:37.820- 29:40.560* :  His bail conditions require him to live here at this house
*29:40.560- 29:41.240* :  in Suffolk.
*29:41.540- 29:43.860* :  It's the home of Mr. Assange's friend and supporter,
*29:43.860- 29:47.380* :  Von Smith, a journalist who founded London's frontline club.
*29:48.280- 29:49.960* :  That was very challenging for us all.
*29:50.680- 29:53.040* :  Half the club thought that it was really good,
*29:53.240- 29:54.420* :  and the other half didn't.
*29:54.620- 29:56.960* :  And we reconciled it, I think, in the way
*29:56.960- 29:58.700* :  that journalists can do these things.
*29:58.700- 30:00.820* :  We all got together in a room and listened to each other.
*30:01.180- 30:04.340* :  Sometimes we look back other way we treat people in history
*30:04.340- 30:05.400* :  and we regret it.
*30:06.020- 30:09.580* :  And I feel Julian as a case, and I think future people
*30:09.580- 30:11.020* :  feel that we mistreated him.
*30:11.880- 30:13.340* :  From your vantage point, how do you think
*30:14.240- 30:16.600* :  the journalist's experience of conflict has changed over
*30:16.600- 30:18.760* :  the 20 years the club has been here?
*30:19.180- 30:20.980* :  I think it's barely recognizable.
*30:20.980- 30:22.840* :  It's become more dangerous undoubtedly,
*30:22.960- 30:25.220* :  because you only have to look if you go to buyer
*30:25.220- 30:26.060* :  in Northern France.
*30:26.160- 30:28.560* :  They have a memorial for journalists who've been killed.
*30:28.940- 30:31.200* :  Every year, they carved these names in stone,
*30:31.200- 30:33.260* :  and there are more every year.
*30:33.660- 30:36.760* :  Von Smith, who founded the frontline club here in London.
*30:37.300- 30:38.200* :  Now, let's end on names.
*30:38.360- 30:39.440* :  We don't choose our names.
*30:39.440- 30:41.220* :  We have our parents to thank for that.
*30:41.220- 30:43.120* :  I'm happy, mostly with mine.
*30:43.680- 30:46.040* :  But is that going to be the case for the baby in Australia,
*30:46.040- 30:49.520* :  whose parents decided to test their country's bureaucrats
*30:49.720- 30:52.760* :  to its limits by registering their son as
*30:53.140- 30:54.220* :  Methanphetamine rules?
*30:54.760- 30:55.860* :  Yes, you heard that correctly.
*30:55.860- 30:57.420* :  Methanphetamine rules.
*30:58.220- 30:59.820* :  Kirsten Driesdell is a journalist,
*30:59.820- 31:02.100* :  and she and her husband wanted to find out
*31:02.100- 31:04.180* :  where the new South Wales Register Office
*31:04.180- 31:06.280* :  would draw the line with their third child
*31:06.280- 31:07.280* :  who was born in July.
*31:07.820- 31:09.400* :  It turns out, Meth is OK.
*31:09.400- 31:11.040* :  The name was legally recorded.
*31:11.580- 31:13.960* :  Tim Frank's has been finding out from the baby's mom.
*31:14.700- 31:16.820* :  My jaw hit the floor when I saw the birth certificate.
*31:17.420- 31:20.260* :  The registry have acknowledged that this student
*31:20.260- 31:21.400* :  have happened, and they're going to work
*31:21.400- 31:23.440* :  through processing a correction for us.
*31:23.500- 31:26.380* :  So, fortunately, there is no lasting harm
*31:26.380- 31:28.240* :  done to my beautiful baby boy.
*31:28.520- 31:30.160* :  The name that is registered initially
*31:30.160- 31:33.700* :  will remain in perpetuity in some form.
*31:33.720- 31:34.700* :  Is that not the case?
*31:35.020- 31:36.440* :  There will be an internal record
*31:36.440- 31:39.000* :  that this has happened, obviously, within the registry.
*31:39.000- 31:41.820* :  But he will have his own birth certificate
*31:41.820- 31:46.200* :  with his real name on it, and this will not appear on that.
*31:46.320- 31:46.660* :  OK.
*31:47.160- 31:48.020* :  When are you going to tell him?
*31:48.220- 31:50.640* :  Well, we'll see how that goes.
*31:50.640- 31:54.740* :  Obviously, we will tell him whether we hold off
*31:54.740- 31:57.220* :  until it's 21st birthday and present him
*31:57.220- 32:00.640* :  with the missing birth certificate then,
*32:01.000- 32:02.540* :  or if he finds out earlier, we'll just
*32:02.540- 32:03.340* :  see how it goes.
*32:03.460- 32:06.640* :  Assuming that none of his friends tell him
*32:06.640- 32:08.640* :  or that he has access to the internet, for example,
*32:09.200- 32:11.900* :  take me back to the moment when you came up with a name.
*32:11.900- 32:14.680* :  I mean, it's a striking name, methamphetamine rules.
*32:14.880- 32:16.120* :  Why that one, in particular?
*32:16.660- 32:19.880* :  Honestly, because we just thought it's so outrageous
*32:20.740- 32:24.480* :  that there's no possibility it will get through.
*32:25.020- 32:26.060* :  And yet, here we are.
*32:26.400- 32:29.320* :  Well, you know, I'm sure that you've done a public service
*32:29.380- 32:31.840* :  by suggesting to the New South Wales registry
*32:31.840- 32:35.400* :  obviously need to tighten up their procedures.
*32:35.860- 32:37.420* :  Have you come up with a new name?
*32:37.740- 32:38.140* :  Oh, yes.
*32:38.140- 32:40.320* :  I mean, he's got the name we call him.
*32:40.480- 32:42.080* :  We're not going public with that name,
*32:42.140- 32:44.680* :  because we're just trying not to have it appear too much
*32:44.820- 32:46.180* :  in conjunction with this one.
*32:46.380- 32:46.580* :  Yeah.
*32:46.780- 32:48.420* :  I think, with the passage of time,
*32:48.420- 32:50.300* :  I know the internet is around forever,
*32:50.340- 32:53.920* :  but I'm sure there will be an outrageous story
*32:53.920- 32:55.580* :  to take this one's place by next week.
*32:55.600- 32:56.040* :  Yeah.
*32:56.600- 32:58.260* :  And what sort of a baby is he?
*32:58.600- 33:02.480* :  Clearly he's not anything like a methamphetamine addict
*33:02.480- 33:04.720* :  at the age of eight weeks.
*33:04.720- 33:06.900* :  But is he, I mean, tell me what he's like?
*33:07.280- 33:10.800* :  He's actually the most delightful, beautiful,
*33:11.300- 33:13.420* :  easiest, most relaxed little baby.
*33:13.760- 33:14.880* :  He's a happy little chap.
*33:14.880- 33:17.020* :  He's started smiling in the last couple of weeks.
*33:17.640- 33:21.020* :  He's my third child, and I have my eldest is five
*33:21.020- 33:22.060* :  and the next one's three.
*33:22.060- 33:26.260* :  So the fact that we've been blessed with such a chilled little guy,
*33:26.260- 33:27.980* :  we're feeling very lucky about him.
*33:28.280- 33:28.960* :  That is wonderful.
*33:28.960- 33:30.380* :  But my goodness, me, what a start.
*33:30.380- 33:32.120* :  I mean, not just to his life, but also to,
*33:32.700- 33:34.300* :  I mean, you're an experienced parent now,
*33:34.360- 33:35.720* :  but still eight weeks old,
*33:35.720- 33:38.500* :  and you're dealing not just with him,
*33:38.500- 33:41.720* :  but also with a sort of international new sensation.
*33:41.720- 33:44.060* :  I mean, it's quite a lot for you to cope with.
*33:44.240- 33:47.100* :  The last 24 hours has been crazy.
*33:47.480- 33:49.160* :  I did a show a couple of years ago,
*33:49.160- 33:52.820* :  and this was exactly the kind of media incident
*33:52.820- 33:55.280* :  that we would unpack and analyze
*33:55.280- 33:57.080* :  with the people at the centre of it.
*33:57.560- 33:59.100* :  It's kind of been interesting for me
*33:59.100- 34:01.160* :  to be on the other side of that.
*34:01.220- 34:03.020* :  It was like watching a fire start.
*34:03.640- 34:06.660* :  Kirsten Driesdale, mom of meth in New South Wales.
*34:09.480- 34:10.660* :  And that's all from us for now,
*34:10.660- 34:11.720* :  but there will be a new edition
*34:11.720- 34:13.380* :  of the Global News Podcast later.
