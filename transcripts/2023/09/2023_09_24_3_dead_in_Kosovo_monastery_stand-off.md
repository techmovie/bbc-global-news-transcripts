*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.480* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.160- 00:23.080* :  I'm Andrew Patron in the early hours of Monday the 25th September. These are our main stories.
*00:23.100- 00:29.460* :  Police in Kosovo kill three government to end a standoff at a monastery. A space capsule which
*00:29.460- 00:35.720* :  could shed light on how planets were formed lands in the US. Touchdown of the Osiris-Rex
*00:35.720- 00:41.780* :  Sampler turn capsule. A journey of a billion miles to asteroid Bennu and back has come to an end.
*00:42.080- 00:46.520* :  And hundreds of ethnic Armenians lead the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*00:48.500- 00:55.220* :  Also in this podcast, pornographic images of real Spanish teenagers created by artificial intelligence.
*00:55.480- 01:01.580* :  She said, Mum, there are photos of me circulating of my naked torso. These are fake photos of girls
*01:01.580- 01:06.440* :  that have been created a lot right now. And the Thai elephants and their handlers
*01:06.700- 01:10.480* :  who've ditched performing for tourists in exchange for a more peaceful lifestyle.
*01:13.700- 01:18.000* :  Let's start in Kosovo, where a standoff between police and heavily armed government in a
*01:18.000- 01:22.120* :  Serbian orthodox monastery after they killed a policeman has now come to an end.
*01:22.520- 01:25.840* :  The incident took place in a town in the north, which is mainly Serb.
*01:26.200- 01:30.180* :  The police eventually seized control of the monastery. Three of the government were killed,
*01:30.180- 01:33.580* :  two were arrested, and large numbers of weapons were seized.
*01:33.580- 01:37.180* :  I found out more from our Balkans correspondent, Guida Lorny.
*01:37.500- 01:42.740* :  The situation is now reported to be calm. The religious authorities at the monastery
*01:43.200- 01:47.700* :  are saying that the armed persons who broke through the monastery gate have left.
*01:47.800- 01:55.500* :  And currently, they have both Kosovo police and also Ulex, which is the EU's rule of law mission
*01:55.500- 02:01.040* :  in Kosovo, inside the monastery. So that's what the monastery itself is saying.
*02:01.040- 02:06.980* :  In terms of what's coming out of the authorities in Kosovo, the Prime Minister, Albin Kurti,
*02:07.300- 02:12.600* :  is now saying that they've arrested six people in connection with these incidents,
*02:12.600- 02:16.620* :  the shooting and the killing of the police officer, as well as the sporadic shooting throughout
*02:16.620- 02:21.020* :  the day. They've been three people involved in this armed group who've been killed,
*02:21.460- 02:26.700* :  and now the process of questioning these people will start to find out exactly who they are and
*02:26.700- 02:31.280* :  what the motivations were. Now obviously tensions are pretty high in the region before all of this.
*02:31.940- 02:34.200* :  This can only inflame them. What happens next, do you think?
*02:34.880- 02:39.180* :  Well, it's really a very tricky situation indeed. This is the most serious incident that we've
*02:39.180- 02:45.340* :  seen in Kosovo for some time, and any incident like this has the potential to escalate and become
*02:45.340- 02:51.300* :  extremely serious. So if this really has now ended with arrests or the dispersal of this armed
*02:51.300- 02:56.360* :  group and there's no further shooting, that can only be a good thing. What's going to happen
*02:56.360- 03:01.740* :  next, of course, is working out who actually is responsible for all this. Serbian officials have
*03:01.740- 03:06.900* :  already said the Kosovo has been far too quick to point the blame at Serbia, Prime Minister
*03:06.900- 03:12.300* :  Kurti accusing Belgrade of funding this armed group. Serbia is saying, well, how can you possibly
*03:12.300- 03:17.120* :  know this when you haven't arrested or questioned them yet? So all of that has to be sorted out,
*03:17.540- 03:22.060* :  and the European Union wants to bring everybody back around the negotiating table to try to
*03:22.060- 03:26.900* :  de-escalate the tensions. Well, the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia have been trading accusations
*03:26.900- 03:32.340* :  against each other over this. Before the siege had ended, Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti,
*03:32.340- 03:37.280* :  who's from Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, said Serbia was behind the attack.
*03:42.180- 03:46.420* :  We condemn this criminal and terrorist attack. Organized crime with political,
*03:46.420- 03:52.400* :  financial and logistical support from Belgrade is attacking our country. The criminals and
*03:52.400- 03:56.480* :  those who give them orders will fail. They will be caught, tried and punished.
*03:57.240- 04:02.480* :  The Serbian President Alexander Vucic responded by blaming Prime Minister Kurti for continuing
*04:02.480- 04:12.360* :  to provoke the local Serb population. He left people alone to worry about their future,
*04:12.360- 04:18.880* :  and all the time he kept revoking them. I regret that some Serbs succumb to those provocations.
*04:19.540- 04:25.500* :  Arbin Kurti is the only one to blame. Arbin Kurti is the only one who wants conflict and war.
*04:25.960- 04:30.860* :  His life's desire is to drag us into war with NATO. That's the only thing he wants.
*04:31.860- 04:36.180* :  Next to Nagorno-Karabakh, an area so badly damaged by fighting,
*04:36.620- 04:39.580* :  that people who live there say they have nowhere to bury their dead.
*04:40.240- 04:44.700* :  Now over a thousand ethnic Armenian refugees have reportedly arrived in Armenia
*04:44.700- 04:50.100* :  after fleeing the disputed territory that was captured by Azerbaijanis forces six days ago.
*04:50.700- 04:54.220* :  The area has been largely controlled by ethnic Armenians for 30 years,
*04:54.220- 04:57.280* :  even though it's been internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan.
*04:57.500- 05:02.520* :  The Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, whose face calls to resign in daily protests,
*05:02.600- 05:06.900* :  said he believed the number of ethnic Armenians leaving the region would now grow.
*05:09.220- 05:13.040* :  Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh continue to face the threat of ethnic cleansing,
*05:13.040- 05:17.340* :  and a less real living conditions are created for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh,
*05:17.500- 05:20.720* :  and there were effective mechanisms of protection from ethnic cleansing.
*05:21.260- 05:25.520* :  Then the likelihood that the Armenians will see XR from their homeland as the only way to
*05:25.520- 05:28.040* :  preserve their lives increases significantly.
*05:28.760- 05:33.680* :  Ethnic Armenian separatists fighters in Nagorno-Karabakh have now agreed to put down their weapons.
*05:34.400- 05:37.780* :  In Azerbaijan's capital Baku Forest, here's Olga Ivshina.
*05:38.120- 05:43.220* :  We got back from Shusha, which Azaria authorities can see the capital of Karabakh.
*05:43.540- 05:47.920* :  We were among the very first journalists which were allowed in since the start of the September
*05:48.180- 05:53.660* :  hostilities. However, this was a tightly controlled trip, so we were escorted into Shusha
*05:53.940- 06:01.900* :  and show a large display of weapons, including tanks, APCs, automatic guns, RPGs,
*06:02.160- 06:08.540* :  huge amount of weapons, all laid down by Karabakh Armenians in the recent 48 hours.
*06:08.800- 06:11.540* :  This was one of the prerequisites of the ceasefire.
*06:11.840- 06:14.640* :  The situation in Karabakh, however, remains tense.
*06:14.960- 06:20.480* :  Azaria authorities are saying they are ready to provide security guarantees for all civilians
*06:20.480- 06:23.940* :  in the region, and they will only target armed rebels.
*06:24.300- 06:29.940* :  However, Karabakh Armenians who had trapped in Stepanakert are very worried about the security,
*06:29.940- 06:36.360* :  humanitarian crisis on the ground. People say the food, water, and medical supplies are lacking.
*06:36.360- 06:42.340* :  There is no electricity. We were able to see it with our own eyes, because Shusha is overlooking
*06:42.340- 06:48.480* :  Stepanakert. So as soon as it became dark, Stepanakert was pitch black, which was a stark contrast
*06:48.500- 06:51.220* :  with the brightly-lead streets of Shusha.
*06:51.360- 06:55.980* :  Azerbaijan says it has established a few refugee camps and is ready to allocate refugees.
*06:55.980- 07:03.040* :  However, Karabakh Armenians are highly suspicious. These decades-long conflict has seen a lot of
*07:03.040- 07:08.900* :  bloodshed, both sides are accusing each other of war crimes, and there is a lot of mistrust
*07:08.900- 07:13.880* :  on both sides, which doesn't help the process. Despite all the statements, all the diplomatic
*07:13.880- 07:20.120* :  agreements and calls to action, it's clear that destiny of Karabakh Armenians is currently
*07:20.120- 07:27.140* :  in a very hands. Hoga Evshina in Baku. A capsule carrying dust and rock from an asteroid,
*07:27.140- 07:31.720* :  which has been traveling through the solar system for billions of years, has landed safely
*07:38.600- 07:41.540* :  back on Earth. And touchdown of the Osiris-Rex sampler turn capsule,
*07:41.540- 07:46.600* :  a journey of a billion miles to asteroid Bennu and back has come to an end,
*07:47.040- 07:49.720* :  opening a time capsule to our ancient solar system.
*07:50.360- 07:55.920* :  The craft touched down and a desert in Utah at 8.52 local time, marking the end of NASA's
*07:55.920- 07:59.700* :  seven-year mission and the beginning of years of study of its precious cargo.
*08:00.360- 08:04.980* :  The samples could answer fundamental questions about the origins of our planet and how life
*08:04.980- 08:10.200* :  upon it began. There's also a chance the asteroid Bennu could collide with the Earth one day
*08:10.200- 08:15.800* :  in the future. So how serious is that threat in Utah for us? Our science correspondent, Jonathan
*08:15.800- 08:23.180* :  Amos. It's a possibility, an outside possibility, I should say, but it's useful to understand what
*08:23.180- 08:28.240* :  these objects are made of, how they're put together, because if you do want to use some sort of
*08:28.240- 08:33.700* :  defense strategy, maybe you want to deflect it slightly so that when it intersects with Earth,
*08:33.700- 08:39.100* :  orbit it either just goes in front of it or just behind it. And knowing what it's made about
*08:39.100- 08:44.960* :  will tell you something about the sort of thing you might do to move it, you know, smash something
*08:44.960- 08:49.680* :  into it. But that's one reason why we might want to study asteroid Bennu.
*08:50.120- 08:55.960* :  Okay, now everything, every fact about this whole mission about how far away Bennu is, how long
*08:55.960- 09:02.160* :  it's taken the spacecraft to get there and back is mind blowing, as is the idea that the cargo
*09:02.160- 09:06.720* :  that's just landed in the desert where you are could explain all sorts that we don't already know
*09:07.140- 09:11.620* :  about how life on Earth began. If you want to understand the history of planet Earth,
*09:12.140- 09:16.960* :  it's quite difficult on planet Earth itself because the rocks here constantly recycle
*09:16.960- 09:22.060* :  plate tectonics, weathering. And so if you pick up a rock and you look at it, it's actually not a very
*09:22.060- 09:28.240* :  old rock, okay? You want rock that is original. Stuff from four and a half billion years ago
*09:28.240- 09:33.840* :  when the sun was forming and the planets were forming around it. And asteroids like Bennu,
*09:33.980- 09:40.400* :  we think, are the leftover building blocks, if you like. And therefore the chemistry in an asteroid
*09:40.400- 09:45.400* :  like Bennu probably preserves the chemistry that existed four and a half billion years ago.
*09:45.760- 09:50.840* :  So they're looking to that. They want to see things like the amount of water that the rock holds.
*09:50.840- 09:56.100* :  This beautiful Earth of ours is covered in 70% water, the oceans. Where did that water come from?
*09:56.360- 10:01.500* :  When we consider how Earth started, it would have been this hot boiling rock. It would have evaporated
*10:01.500- 10:07.620* :  all of its water. But it is here now. And the other fascinating thing is the carbon chemistry.
*10:07.620- 10:13.960* :  How did life get started? We're based on carbon. Is there carbon compounds in this asteroid that can
*10:13.960- 10:20.280* :  tell us about the origin of life? John Neymos with some big questions for us in Utah. A small town
*10:20.280- 10:25.940* :  in southern Spain has been rocked by a case involving fake nude photographs of young girls,
*10:26.400- 10:32.020* :  which have been generated by artificial intelligence. More than 20 girls have been the victims of the
*10:32.020- 10:37.180* :  fakes, which raise questions about the use of AI. From southern Spain, here's Guy Hegeco.
*10:39.720- 10:45.640* :  Almendralejo is a sleepy town on the plains of Extremadura. But in recent days,
*10:45.640- 10:52.060* :  the rest of Spain has been watching it closely. As many of its families have had their worlds turned
*10:59.800- 11:06.360* :  upside down. Nude images of girls from the town aged between 11 and 16 have been circulating
*11:06.360- 11:12.960* :  on social media. But the pictures are not real. They were created using photos of the same girls
*11:12.960- 11:19.420* :  fully clothed, often taken from their own social media accounts. These were then fed into an AI
*11:19.420- 11:25.760* :  application, which provided imagined images of the girls either partly or fully unclothed.
*11:26.760- 11:30.500* :  Maria Blanco-Rio is the mother of a 14-year-old girl who was targeted.
*11:34.240- 11:39.020* :  One day my daughter came out of school. She got in the car and I asked her what was the matter.
*11:39.700- 11:46.060* :  She said, Mom, there are photos of me circulating of my naked torso. I asked that if she had taken
*11:46.060- 11:51.680* :  any photos of herself nude and she said, No Mom, these are fake photos of girls that have been
*11:51.680- 11:56.940* :  created a lot right now. And there are other girls in my class that this has happened to as well.
*11:57.440- 12:03.140* :  A total of 28 girls have come forward so far, complaining that fake nude pictures of them have
*12:03.140- 12:11.000* :  been posted on social media. I felt impotent. I asked myself, How could this happen? You don't
*12:11.000- 12:16.840* :  imagine this kind of thing. There are some girls who are in a very bad way. There are girls who
*12:16.840- 12:23.160* :  won't even leave their house. The police are investigating at least 10 boys aged 12 to 14,
*12:23.160- 12:28.440* :  who have been identified as being involved. The case came to light in great part because of
*12:28.440- 12:35.140* :  Miriam Al-Adib, a gynecologist and the mother of one of the girls affected. I said to the girls
*12:35.140- 12:40.180* :  affected that they should not be afraid or feel ashamed or feel responsible because they had
*12:40.180- 12:45.940* :  done nothing wrong. I also recorded a message for the boys in which I said, Perhaps you don't
*12:45.940- 12:52.500* :  realize but this is very serious and it has very serious consequences. These are normal kids,
*12:52.500- 12:58.220* :  they are not criminals. But if you give a normal kid a gun to play with, he might end up committing
*12:58.220- 13:03.980* :  a crime. And if you give him a toy to play with like artificial intelligence, he might end up
*13:03.980- 13:09.980* :  committing a serious crime. It's still not clear what charges, if any, the boys believe to be
*13:09.980- 13:16.260* :  responsible could face, particularly given their ages. But while this case has shaken this small
*13:16.260- 13:22.200* :  town in a corner of Spain, it's clear that with AI technology so readily available,
*13:22.200- 13:29.600* :  this could have happened almost anywhere. Guy Hechka reporting. When one of Britain's worst serial
*13:29.600- 13:35.900* :  killers was arrested in January 1981, it finally put an end to the biggest manhunt the UK had ever
*13:35.900- 13:41.960* :  seen. Peter Sutcliffe, otherwise known as the Yorkshire Ripper, murdered at least 13 women and
*13:41.960- 13:46.780* :  tried to kill others, stabbing them and brutalising their bodies. Countless books and TV
*13:46.780- 13:51.000* :  programs have been devoted to the subject. More recently attempts have been made to look at the
*13:51.000- 13:55.700* :  story from the perspective of the women and why the police didn't pay more attention to the
*13:55.700- 14:01.920* :  testimonies of survivors. A new program is being released in the UK called The Long Shadow. Rebecca
*14:01.920- 14:06.700* :  Kesby spoke to Jones Smith, a journalist who covered the story. But first we'll hear from
*14:07.020- 14:12.580* :  Mo Lea, who was attacked by Peter Sutcliffe in October 1980. How does she feel about the new
*14:12.580- 14:18.500* :  program? It doesn't catapult me back in time as it used to because I've kind of become a
*14:18.500- 14:25.520* :  custom to talking about this into the prayer. I mean is there a sense that as a survivor you feel
*14:26.160- 14:31.020* :  maybe some responsibility to talk because you can and there are those women that obviously
*14:31.660- 14:37.260* :  can't. Absolutely as a survivor I do feel a responsibility for all of the other women involved
*14:37.520- 14:44.700* :  and my responsibility is to try and get justice to see if we can somehow rectify the legacy of
*14:44.700- 14:50.800* :  the sheer stupidity of the press and the police in particular. Well let's bring Jones Smith in
*14:50.800- 14:58.240* :  because it took years to catch Peter Sutcliffe. There were so many clues pointing to him. He was
*14:58.240- 15:04.040* :  interviewed by police nine times in the course of their inquiries and never arrested and carried on
*15:04.040- 15:09.300* :  killing people and it's been one of the biggest scandals if you like of this. Why do you think
*15:09.300- 15:14.740* :  the police didn't catch him sooner? They didn't listen to women. What the police did was because the
*15:14.740- 15:19.500* :  first murders took place in a red light area. They wrongly assumed that the first victim was a
*15:19.500- 15:25.100* :  prostitute. They told the world that this was a man who hated prostitutes and they missed
*15:25.100- 15:31.000* :  absolutely crucial eyewitness evidence. One of the other major criticisms was that the police
*15:31.000- 15:37.560* :  got sidetracked by what turned out to be a hoax. Another man who wanted his moment of fame
*15:37.560- 15:42.900* :  claimed responsibility and sent the police some audio tapes and letters as well claiming to
*15:42.900- 15:49.220* :  be this ripper character and it sent the police off in the wrong direction partly because of his
*15:49.220- 16:00.080* :  very distinctive accent. We've got a little clip of it just here now. So a lot of money and
*16:00.080- 16:06.520* :  effort went into chasing this character and it wasn't him. It was an obvious hoax. I was at a press
*16:06.520- 16:10.580* :  conference in Manchester. There was a big build up to it. You know, we're inviting you to a press
*16:10.580- 16:15.440* :  conference where you will hear the voice of the Yorkshire Ripper. It was very like that. Then they
*16:15.440- 16:20.000* :  played the tape and I said there is nothing on that tape that isn't in the public domain. I really
*16:20.000- 16:23.180* :  thought it was a hoax but of course they didn't listen because they never listened to women.
*16:23.420- 16:29.060* :  Now they've been told by several of the surviving victims that he was local but they knew better
*16:29.500- 16:34.480* :  and several women died and were attacked directly as a result of them falling for that hoax.
*16:35.020- 16:40.880* :  Mo, you were a young student at the time in Leeds which is the scene of many of the killings and
*16:40.880- 16:47.460* :  can you describe how women felt at that fear? It was palpable. The art studios were empty.
*16:47.460- 16:53.980* :  Women didn't go out during the evening. There were billboards all over the town. These ridiculous
*16:53.980- 17:01.160* :  recordings of this hoax that were played on the bus. It was nuts. He did target you, didn't he?
*17:01.260- 17:07.020* :  Yeah, he did. A group of us would go out to a pub in Headingly and my friends after we left,
*17:07.060- 17:11.800* :  I think it was about 10 past 10, said, do you want us to walk you into town to catch the bus?
*17:11.880- 17:18.280* :  And I'm like, no, it's fine. Don't be silly. And I carried on walking home alone and I thought
*17:18.280- 17:24.000* :  I'd take a shortcut and as I walked down this road, this young man I could hear a voice to my right.
*17:24.000- 17:28.300* :  He was on the other side of the street. I turned around and he started walking towards me.
*17:28.360- 17:33.060* :  I didn't recognise him even though it was dark. I could see his eyes and I could see his hair.
*17:33.380- 17:38.280* :  I made my excuses out. I'm sorry, I've got to catch my boss and I carried on walking down the street
*17:38.340- 17:44.520* :  and I could hear his footsteps behind me. So I started to run and as I ran, I heard his footsteps
*17:44.520- 17:49.460* :  getting quicker and quicker and then I felt this massive blow to the top of my head and that was
*17:49.460- 17:54.300* :  it. A black doubt. I survived because of the intervention of a passerby who apparently heard me
*17:54.300- 17:59.220* :  let out a scream as I felt but I don't remember doing that. And he wasn't even caught by the
*17:59.220- 18:03.220* :  detectives who were searching for him. He was actually caught by South Yorkshire police
*18:03.760- 18:08.840* :  and it was just that a sort of you know sharp eyed traffic cop saw that he had rather crudely
*18:08.840- 18:13.560* :  attached fake number plates to his car and they stopped him and he was sitting there with a young
*18:13.560- 18:18.420* :  woman who he claimed was his girlfriend but of course he just picked up another potential victim
*18:18.920- 18:23.960* :  and by then 13 women were dead definitely. The nine had been attacked and injured very, very
*18:23.960- 18:28.980* :  seriously. You know there's an instinct now to say well it's all different now and I don't
*18:28.980- 18:34.060* :  think that it is because in London where we have the largest police force in the UK, the Metropolitan
*18:34.060- 18:40.120* :  Police, nearly 500 police officers are actually under investigation for domestic or sexual violence
*18:40.120- 18:46.560* :  themselves. Police forces were riddled with misogyny in the 1970s they are now and misogyny
*18:46.560- 18:53.080* :  affects the way they carry out investigations but for me as a young journalist what I realise is
*18:53.080- 18:57.520* :  that women are on our own. We can't trust the police and I feel very strongly that that's still
*18:57.520- 19:00.700* :  the case. And the new programme is called The Long Shadow.
*19:03.180- 19:08.340* :  Stottacan the Ethiopian athlete who smashed two minutes off the women's marathon world record.
*19:08.340- 19:13.580* :  This victory shows that hard training and good preparation prove their worth and for Ethiopia
*19:13.580- 19:18.800* :  as a country it will probably be a big boost for both men and women for the Olympics.
*19:26.020- 19:31.720* :  The attacker had very good knowledge of banking systems. 3.1 billion dollars in stolen funds.
*19:31.720- 19:35.120* :  Money laundering operations. The cyber criminal group. These are smart guys.
*19:35.720- 19:41.240* :  Season one and two of the Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service are available in full right now.
*19:41.700- 19:46.020* :  Following the twists and turns in the incredible story of the Lazarus group hackers.
*19:46.660- 19:50.080* :  The Lazarus Heist from the BBC World Service catch up with the whole series now
*19:50.500- 19:52.100* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*19:55.740- 20:00.720* :  Ukraine and Russia will face each other for a second week of hearings at the UN's highest
*20:00.720- 20:04.860* :  court on Monday. Kia brought the case to the International Court of Justice,
*20:05.260- 20:10.340* :  arguing that Moscow had used false claims of genocide to justify the 2022 invasion.
*20:10.380- 20:15.520* :  But these hearings are focusing on Russia's claims that the ICJ doesn't have jurisdiction,
*20:15.540- 20:20.660* :  legal mandate to rule on the case at all. And a hologon has been following the hearings in the
*20:20.660- 20:26.800* :  Hague. Keeve is arguing Moscow violated the 1948 genocide convention when President Putin claimed
*20:26.800- 20:32.120* :  the Russian invasion was an effort to stop Keeve from committing genocide. Keeve, which argues
*20:32.120- 20:37.580* :  this justification for the war is illegal under international law, wants the ICJ to order Russia
*20:37.580- 20:43.100* :  to stop hostilities and pay reparations. Russia claims the use of force between states is
*20:43.100- 20:48.140* :  regulated by a different charter. And if there is no genocide in Ukraine, then a complaint filed
*20:48.140- 20:53.620* :  under the genocide convention should be thrown out. Today, Russia's lawyers have all day to make
*20:53.620- 20:58.720* :  their final arguments. Last week, every single European Union member state with the exception
*20:58.720- 21:04.720* :  of Hungary plus Australia, Canada and the UK took part in a full day of hearings, all speaking
*21:04.720- 21:10.680* :  in support of Ukraine's legal stunts. Indigenous communities around the world have often seen
*21:10.680- 21:16.320* :  their land taken and their people exploited. Now, many countries provide legal protection and
*21:16.320- 21:21.580* :  organisations support them. Two sisters and their mother have been charged with fraud in Canada
*21:22.000- 21:27.160* :  after allegedly pretending to be inuit in order to receive benefits from Indigenous organisations.
*21:27.180- 21:34.320* :  Here's Terry Egan. Members of Canada's Inuit community who live in the sparsely populated northern
*21:34.320- 21:40.460* :  territory are able to receive benefits such as grants and scholarships. That's part of an
*21:40.460- 21:48.080* :  Indigenous land claim settlement going back to 1993. In March, though, an organisation that
*21:48.080- 21:54.340* :  represents Inuit interests in the territory said it had become aware of possible fraudulent
*21:54.340- 22:01.280* :  enrollment. They named two sisters Amira and Nadia Gill and their mother Karima Menji.
*22:01.980- 22:08.600* :  Miss Menji is reported to have said the children were adopted and Inuit by birth. Because of that,
*22:08.600- 22:15.240* :  the three were entitled to money provided by two local groups as well as various other benefits.
*22:16.020- 22:20.340* :  But the woman, named as the birth mother, said she was not related to the sisters,
*22:20.900- 22:27.160* :  and after an investigation, the three women were removed from a list of beneficiaries. The matter
*22:27.160- 22:34.140* :  was also referred to the police. Some Canadians have referred to those falsely claiming Indigenous
*22:34.140- 22:42.340* :  ancestry as pretendians. One community member said the term, though, downplays the severity of the
*22:42.340- 22:50.060* :  issue because it sounds harmless. She said she preferred to call it fraud. Now the women are due to
*22:50.060- 22:56.180* :  appear in court. It's not yet clear how they'll plead. Next, to Berlin.
*23:04.460- 23:09.000* :  This is the moment that Ethiopia's tig is to say for spashed the women's world record for the
*23:09.000- 23:14.220* :  marathon, taking more than two minutes off the previous record, the details from Alex Kapstik.
*23:14.880- 23:20.220* :  As one of the fastest marathon courses on the planet, it's no surprise a world record has been
*23:20.220- 23:26.660* :  broken. But even by Berlin's standards, this was an astonishing run by Ethiopia's tigist Arsafa,
*23:26.660- 23:31.420* :  the defending champion who only began competing in the marathon in April last year,
*23:31.420- 23:37.520* :  maintained a blistering pace from start to finish. She won in a remarkable two hours,
*23:37.520- 23:43.080* :  11 minutes and 53 seconds, obliterating the previous best by over two minutes.
*23:43.100- 23:48.400* :  It overshadowed another dominant performance from Elliott Kipchogi in the men's event.
*23:48.400- 23:55.160* :  The 38-year-old Kenyan chalked up an unprecedented fifth title on Berlin's flat in a city route,
*23:55.660- 23:59.860* :  although he wasn't able to challenge the record time he set in the race 12 months ago.
*24:00.460- 24:02.960* :  And this is what Tig is to say for her to say after her win.
*24:03.420- 24:08.840* :  In the first part, I ran in a way that made sure I wasn't exhausted for the second part,
*24:09.580- 24:14.280* :  which is why the first was a bit slower than the second. This victory shows that hard training
*24:14.280- 24:20.160* :  and good preparation proved their worth, and for Ethiopia as a country, it will probably be a
*24:20.160- 24:25.860* :  big boost for both men and women for the Olympics. Now if you recognise this theme tune,
*24:25.860- 24:29.440* :  you'll know which story from the past few days we're talking about next.
*24:43.800- 24:49.920* :  This is the music from HBO's Global Hits Succession about a vastly wealthy and elderly media
*24:49.920- 24:55.680* :  tycoon trying to decide which of his children should inherit his media empire.
*24:55.740- 25:01.520* :  People have drawn parallels between its main character, Logan Roy and the real-life media
*25:01.520- 25:07.500* :  tycoon Rupert Murdoch, who stepped down in recent days, aged 92, handing over his succession
*25:07.500- 25:12.460* :  to his son, Lacklin. The man who plays Logan Roy as the Hollywood star, Brian Cox.
*25:12.980- 25:15.120* :  Well, I think he's been watching too much succession.
*25:17.500- 25:21.760* :  You know, you can't predict these things, but the fact that he chose one son over the other,
*25:22.240- 25:26.380* :  you know, it's quite funny, really. There comes a time, you know, I've just lost my sister.
*25:26.380- 25:31.360* :  She was 92. I think he's doing pretty well. I mean, we've no idea what his mental health is like.
*25:31.360- 25:36.160* :  I suspect it is pretty good, but I think the workload must be just too much now.
*25:36.620- 25:41.140* :  I mean, not surprised, actually, because he is probably the most tenacious human on God's Earth,
*25:41.200- 25:45.940* :  but he's just kept on going. But I think eventually, there comes a point when he has to stop
*25:45.940- 25:49.480* :  and it had to happen, and it's happened. I mean, it's interesting in this statement,
*25:49.480- 25:53.820* :  he's nailing his legacy of his family and his business in one or two sentences.
*25:53.820- 25:59.300* :  My father firmly believed in freedom, and Lacklin is absolutely committed to the cause.
*25:59.660- 26:03.060* :  Well, that's a kind of generalization statement. It doesn't fit him for what?
*26:03.060- 26:07.580* :  Freedom to impose his ideas and other people. Freedom to kind of manipulate certain things
*26:07.580- 26:10.900* :  in certain directions. I mean, he's certainly done a lot of that in his life.
*26:11.180- 26:14.580* :  It's so weird, you know, when you play somebody and people keep saying,
*26:14.580- 26:19.380* :  oh, well, of course, it's Rupert Murdoch, and you go, no, it isn't. It's Logan Roy.
*26:19.380- 26:23.060* :  He's a very different animal, really, from Rupert.
*26:23.220- 26:28.020* :  You know, the one big difference is that Rupert inherited Logan. He didn't have anything,
*26:28.020- 26:33.580* :  and he started from round zero. And of course, the big similarity is that Logan Roy and Rupert
*26:33.580- 26:38.860* :  Murdoch, one in real life, one on TV creation, had children whom they basically either
*26:38.860- 26:43.260* :  pitted against each other or had to choose the talents of to run the business. That's the big
*26:43.260- 26:49.080* :  similarity. Yeah. Well, that's where it falls into the sort of succession mode. So I think there's
*26:49.080- 26:55.900* :  a sort of, I think James was backing off him in many, many ways. So the air position was pretty
*26:55.900- 27:02.560* :  vacant for laughing to kind of move into it. So I suspect that there are some family fish shows
*27:02.560- 27:07.000* :  there, which we will hear about in due time, but not at the moment. You joked at the beginning,
*27:07.000- 27:11.220* :  you know, that Rupert Murdoch had been watching too much succession. In fact, we do know that
*27:11.520- 27:15.520* :  A member of the family did find you in a coffee shop. Oh, yeah, that's happened to me.
*27:15.520- 27:19.640* :  Because it was his son and a lot of very nice work. It was just from my coffee in this
*27:19.640- 27:23.820* :  voice in front of me and that said, well, you know, it's very interesting. And I thought,
*27:24.220- 27:29.500* :  what's he talking about? And he said, yeah, it's an interesting series. I think my wife finds it
*27:29.980- 27:34.760* :  not easy at times, but all the holes she's good about it. And I said, I'm sorry, so what is it
*27:34.760- 27:40.140* :  you're talking about? He said, well, my wife is Elizabeth Murdoch. And I went, oh, I see.
*27:40.360- 27:44.840* :  He was a very, very nice man. And at the end of the conversation, he sort of gave it away a bit
*27:44.840- 27:48.840* :  by saying, do you think that maybe the writers could be a bit nicer to us next?
*27:50.520- 27:54.000* :  Just reading your biography, I know that in 1990, you were
*27:54.000- 27:59.140* :  Lear in Deborah Warner's production. You began as a Shakespearean actor. And our listeners
*27:59.140- 28:04.340* :  would love to know what it says about us, the Lear story, the choice between daughters,
*28:04.340- 28:09.640* :  the Roy's story, the choice between children, the Murdoch story, that there's something in us
*28:09.780- 28:16.520* :  we want to know how blood and treasure divide. We want to see the anger, the jealousy, the pain.
*28:16.640- 28:23.520* :  From the word go, when the show was pitched to me by Jesse Armstrong and Adam McKayon,
*28:23.720- 28:30.080* :  I knew the series was going to work because the public loved those series of dynasty,
*28:30.080- 28:36.940* :  Dallas. So they're obsessed by families because everybody has a family. So naturally it reflects
*28:36.940- 28:42.780* :  on your family or the lack of success in your family or the opposite of your family, the
*28:42.780- 28:48.400* :  success of your family. And I think that's what the audiences enjoy, they want it, and they
*28:48.400- 28:54.860* :  want more. The actor Brian Cox with patio conno. For years, Thailand's elephant handlers,
*28:54.860- 28:59.300* :  known as Mahoots, have put their elephants to work performing in tourist hotspots,
*28:59.560- 29:05.300* :  despite concerns from animal rights campaigners. COVID restrictions meant that work dried up,
*29:05.520- 29:09.800* :  and hundreds of elephants were taken to a remote part of Thailand to see our lockdowns.
*29:10.280- 29:14.060* :  Three years on, some Mahoots and their elephants now making that move permanent.
*29:14.060- 29:19.060* :  Lucy Hedges has been to meet some of them. I've come to the Thai province of Surin.
*29:19.120- 29:23.780* :  It's a beautiful angriamo area, 300 miles from the capital Bangkok,
*29:24.500- 29:28.360* :  and known as the spiritual home of the Mahoots, or elephant handlers.
*29:32.820- 29:37.780* :  I'm here to meet Syab, who used to work in the northern city of Chiang Mai,
*29:37.780- 29:42.880* :  charging tourists for elephant rides. His companion, Echyset,
*29:43.180- 29:46.240* :  munches grass beside her. And how old is he?
*29:50.020- 29:51.360* :  Is that quite old in elephant years?
*29:52.460- 29:58.100* :  He's not old, elephant years are like human years, so he is in middle age.
*29:59.020- 30:04.280* :  We've been together for 23 years, when we apart, and miss him, and feel lonely.
*30:04.280- 30:06.260* :  I'm not old, I'm not old.
*30:34.700- 30:35.740* :  They have built faith.
*30:37.060- 30:41.660* :  An estimated 3,000 elephants are used across the country to entertain tourists,
*30:42.100- 30:46.000* :  from animal rides to painting pictures with their trunks, or even riding bicycles.
*30:46.880- 30:50.300* :  Animal rights charities say they are routinely mistreated.
*30:50.300- 30:54.760* :  The Thai government says it plans to strengthen laws governing their welfare.
*30:55.640- 30:59.760* :  Elephants like Echyset are now a world away from the busy tourist hotspots, though.
*30:59.760- 31:02.840* :  I notice he is still chained to the floor.
*31:03.420- 31:07.020* :  Syab says it's for his safety due to his large size.
*31:07.620- 31:10.880* :  You know, he's in the same place for a long time. Is he a happy elephant?
*31:14.160- 31:16.760* :  He's an extremely happy elephant, definitely.
*31:17.400- 31:20.300* :  He lives a simple life, and now he leaves simply.
*31:21.020- 31:24.840* :  Heading, going for a walk. Now his life is easy.
*31:27.180- 31:31.660* :  It's more than three years since the first COVID lockdown, and Syab says he has no intention
*31:31.660- 31:36.700* :  of putting Echyset back to work. He plans to continue living on land provided for him,
*31:36.700- 31:41.000* :  by an institution called the Elephant Kingdom, which tourists can visit,
*31:41.360- 31:43.860* :  though there'll be no rides or circus tricks.
*31:44.800- 31:49.540* :  Since Thailand reopened for tourism, many Mahoutes have returned to their old places of work,
*31:50.060- 31:54.480* :  taking their elephants with them, but increased awareness of their welfare has meant
*31:54.480- 31:59.160* :  some of the old attractions have either disappeared or are making new ethical promises.
*31:59.700- 32:04.520* :  Campaigners, though, say the only truly responsible way to see these magnificent beasts
*32:04.860- 32:06.780* :  is at a distance in the wild.
*32:07.760- 32:08.860* :  Lucy Hedge is reporting.
*32:10.820- 32:14.300* :  And that's all from us for now. There'll be a new edition of Global News to download later.
*32:14.640- 32:18.820* :  If you'd like to comment on this edition, do drop us an email, global podcast at

*32:25.120- 32:30.760* :  This edition was mixed by Pat Sissons. The producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin.
*32:31.220- 32:34.560* :  My name's Andrew Peach. Thanks for listening. And until next time, goodbye.
