*00:34.940- 00:39.680* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 27th of September, these are our main stories.
*00:40.040- 00:45.820* :  A judge in New York has ruled that Donald Trump committed fraud for years by repeatedly exaggerating
*00:45.820- 00:51.700* :  his wealth. The speaker of Canada's Parliament has stepped down after he unwittingly praised a
*00:51.700- 00:57.840* :  Ukrainian man who fought for the Nazis during the Second World War. And an Israeli minister has
*00:57.840- 01:02.500* :  become the first member of Israel's Cabinet to make a public visit to Saudi Arabia.
*01:04.940- 01:09.340* :  Also in this podcast. Hey, there's a lot. You'll read a lot what it says. It feels like an elastic
*01:09.340- 01:14.440* :  band flicking against your skin and it absolutely does not. It feels like when you're frying an egg
*01:14.660- 01:19.500* :  and you get that spat coming back. Ouch, we hear about the growing market for tattoo removal.
*01:22.980- 01:28.020* :  We begin in the United States where a judge in New York has ruled that the former US president,
*01:28.020- 01:33.360* :  Donald Trump, committed financial fraud when he was building his property empire. The judge,
*01:33.360- 01:39.960* :  Arthur Angeram, said Mr. Trump exaggerated his wealth by over $2 billion. I spoke to the BBC's
*01:39.960- 01:45.360* :  Peter Bose in the US and asked him what else the judge had said. This is a very serious case
*01:45.360- 01:50.140* :  for the president and just to give you a little bit of the background, it's part of a long term
*01:50.140- 01:56.640* :  investigation into the Trump organization and Donald Trump's business affairs in New York. A
*01:56.640- 02:02.840* :  case brought by New York's Attorney General, the teacher James. It's a civil lawsuit. That lawsuit
*02:02.840- 02:09.240* :  continues, at least continues in a courtroom as of next week. But what the judge has decided in
*02:09.240- 02:12.880* :  this summary judgment, which simply means that the judge believes that there is
*02:13.180- 02:19.380* :  indisputable evidence for him to make a ruling outside of the framework of the trial inside
*02:19.380- 02:25.180* :  a courtroom. So the judges essentially agreed with the allegations brought by the Attorney General
*02:25.180- 02:31.640* :  that Mr. Trump in his business world, his part of his property empire had been committing fraud
*02:31.640- 02:37.060* :  over a number of years. He found that Mr. Trump and his company deceived banks, insurers,
*02:37.620- 02:44.540* :  others by massively overvaluing his assets, exaggerating his network. This is on the paperwork
*02:44.540- 02:50.980* :  that he used in various deals and significant that the judge believes that this goes further
*02:50.980- 02:57.500* :  than just bragging about his riches. He said this company, the Trump organization, repeatedly
*02:57.500- 03:02.120* :  lied about the financial affairs and he said, the judge said that these were tactics that
*03:02.400- 03:07.800* :  crossed a line and violated the law. So Peter, what are the implications of this, both now
*03:07.800- 03:13.200* :  and when it comes to trial, presumably a jury will then decide? Yeah, well interestingly,
*03:13.200- 03:18.400* :  this is a non-jewry trial. So this is going to be in the presence of a judge, but maybe that's
*03:18.400- 03:24.840* :  a small detail, but the implications right now from the ruling that we've just heard, some of the
*03:24.840- 03:30.300* :  Trump organizations' business licenses have been rescinded already, and now that's an immediate
*03:30.300- 03:36.920* :  effect that'll limit the organization's ability to do business in New York. When we get to the case
*03:36.980- 03:42.320* :  and there are other issues still outstanding, in effect what the judge's ruling does is make it
*03:42.320- 03:47.900* :  somewhat easier for the attorney general to prove her case because part of it has been taken off
*03:47.900- 03:55.120* :  the table, but ultimately she is seeking $250 million in penalties against the company and a ban
*03:55.660- 04:01.120* :  on Donald Trump doing business in New York. This is a case that could last for several weeks and we
*04:01.120- 04:07.120* :  obviously won't know the implications until it reaches its conclusion. Peter Bose and Mr. Trump
*04:07.120- 04:14.220* :  had denied wrongdoing. Meanwhile, President Biden has joined a picket line in Detroit urging
*04:14.220- 04:20.280* :  car workers to stick with their strike there. He made a brief speech at a factory on the 12th day
*04:20.280- 04:25.920* :  of major industrial action against America's biggest car makers. Mr. Biden is the first sitting
*04:25.920- 04:32.060* :  US president to join a picket line. He told the strikers they deserved a big pay rise and that it
*04:32.060- 04:38.260* :  was time for manufacturers to step up. You guys, UAW, you've seen the honorable Bill Anderson back
*04:38.260- 04:44.180* :  at two hundred thousand days different forks. Made a lot of sack of money. He gave up a lot and
*04:44.180- 04:49.840* :  the companies were in trouble, but now they're doing it incredibly well. And guess what? You
*04:49.840- 04:55.080* :  should be doing it incredibly well too. You deserve the significant raise you need and other
*04:55.660- 05:06.780* :  benefit. Let's get it back who we lost, okay? Donald Trump is also expected to travel to Michigan
*05:06.780- 05:12.840* :  on Wednesday to show his support for the workers. The blue collar vote in so-called rust belt
*05:12.840- 05:19.180* :  state is key to both men's presidential election campaigns. US correspondent Gary O'Donohue told
*05:19.180- 05:24.160* :  me more about the car workers strike. Well, it's a pretty significant strike. It's the first time
*05:24.160- 05:31.500* :  the union, this big UAW auto workers unions gone out against all the major manufacturers at one
*05:31.500- 05:36.440* :  time. And it's really about a number of things partly about pay and conditions, but also about
*05:36.440- 05:42.500* :  the sort of changing nature of the industry. And the problem for Joe Biden here is that his green
*05:42.500- 05:48.500* :  agenda in some ways is coming up against the unions agenda because he's wants more electric
*05:48.500- 05:54.460* :  vehicles, etc. That means battery plants where there are less union representation and they tend
*05:54.460- 06:00.220* :  to be lower wages. So this is the sort of constituency he needs to prop up. Those auto workers and
*06:00.220- 06:04.840* :  other blue collar workers in places like Michigan where he is today are absolutely crucial to his
*06:04.840- 06:10.880* :  re-election. This is the rust belt of America and this is what gets a democratic presidential candidates
*06:10.880- 06:16.260* :  re-elected. And their crucial too for Donald Trump should he become the Republican Party nominee.
*06:16.800- 06:20.480* :  What is he going to be saying when he visits the same place? Different crowd.
*06:20.480- 06:25.960* :  Donald Trump has successfully, certainly in 2016, persuaded these parts of the rust belt that he
*06:25.960- 06:31.260* :  was on their side. Now, of course, when he was in the White House, he prioritized tax cuts for
*06:31.860- 06:38.560* :  the richer part of the country. In many ways, the jobs started to leak away to Mexico and places
*06:38.560- 06:43.020* :  like that from these sorts of plants. But he's gone on the front foot again today. He said,
*06:43.340- 06:49.060* :  Joe Biden is letting your jobs go. I will save your jobs. He says, I will make you rich.
*06:49.160- 06:54.440* :  This is promised to the auto workers. So the old rhetoric is back. And significant that Donald
*06:54.440- 06:59.880* :  Trump will be addressing non-unionized workers? I think that's to ensure a kind of welcome he wants.
*07:00.120- 07:05.100* :  These message will be to the wider blue collar constituency in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,
*07:05.140- 07:09.140* :  those sorts of places. But he needs to make sure that the optics are right at the time.
*07:09.860- 07:15.360* :  Gary O'Donohue. The US government has launched a lawsuit against the retail giant Amazon
*07:15.360- 07:21.660* :  accusing it of stifling competition across a huge portion of the online economy. The Federal
*07:21.660- 07:27.440* :  Trade Commission and 17 American states say that Amazon's actions allow it to prevent rivals
*07:27.440- 07:32.940* :  from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers and stifle innovation. From New York,
*07:32.940- 07:38.680* :  he's Erin Delmore. The US's competition regulator, the Federal Trade Commission, has been building
*07:38.680- 07:44.120* :  its case against Amazon for years. It alleges that Amazon biases its search results,
*07:44.120- 07:49.840* :  favoring its own products over better quality alternatives, also that it forces sellers to offer
*07:49.840- 07:54.600* :  their lowest prices on Amazon by placing them lower in search results if they don't.
*07:54.600- 08:00.000* :  The government also claims that Amazon requires sellers to use its network of delivery services
*08:00.460- 08:05.960* :  or risk being left out of its paid for prime program. In a statement, Amazon's General Council
*08:05.960- 08:10.860* :  rejected the accusations, saying the company's practices increased competition, innovation,
*08:10.860- 08:15.720* :  and selection, and resulted in lower prices and faster delivery for customers.
*08:16.160- 08:19.340* :  Erin Delmore. In Canada, the Speaker of the country's parliament,
*08:19.340- 08:25.660* :  Anthony Rota has resigned. Days after a former Nazi soldier was honored there as a Canadian hero.
*08:26.100- 08:32.820* :  Jaroslav Honka, a 98-year-old Ukrainian, was given a standing ovation in the chamber during a visit
*08:32.820- 08:39.340* :  by President Zelensky. Mr Rota has apologised and said he regretted his mistake. Grant Ferret reports.
*08:40.180- 08:44.820* :  An event which was intended to bolst the support for Ukraine and highlight the strength of bonds
*08:44.820- 08:50.720* :  with Canada has turned into a political and diplomatic fiasco. President Zelensky and the Canadian
*08:50.720- 08:56.500* :  Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, joined the ovation for Jaroslav Honka in the parliamentary chamber in
*08:56.500- 09:01.060* :  Ottawa. Mr Rota said he'd fought for Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union,
*09:01.060- 09:07.480* :  and was a Ukrainian and Canadian hero. It quickly became clear that Mr Honka had been a volunteer
*09:07.480- 09:13.020* :  with a Nazi unit. The Speaker initially resisted pressure to step down, but has now announced
*09:13.020- 09:19.500* :  his resignation. He said he alone was responsible for inviting Mr Honka. A Jewish organisation in
*09:19.500- 09:24.020* :  Canada is among those to have accused the Speaker of handing a propaganda victory to Russia.
*09:24.660- 09:29.900* :  Grant Ferret. There were public signs on Tuesday of move towards establishing formal diplomatic
*09:29.900- 09:35.900* :  relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, an idea that was unthinkable until a few years ago.
*09:35.900- 09:41.260* :  For the first time, a member of the Israeli Cabinet, the tourism minister Haim Katz has travelled
*09:41.260- 09:47.520* :  to Saudi Arabia. At the same time, Saudi Arabia's first non-resident ambassador to the occupied
*09:47.520- 09:53.980* :  West Bank on a visit there has pledged that the Palestinian cause will be a cornerstone of any
*09:53.980- 09:59.320* :  normalisation deal with his country. Our Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman gave us his analysis.
*10:00.160- 10:07.160* :  Well, what we've seen is a day of firsts in the evolving public diplomacy of the Middle East,
*10:07.200- 10:12.420* :  and you mentioned Haim Katz who in the last few hours it has emerged as visited realities.
*10:12.420- 10:17.880* :  In reality it's going to spend two days of this United Nations tourism conference, but the point
*10:17.880- 10:24.900* :  is this is the first public and official visit by an Israeli Cabinet Minister to Saudi Arabia.
*10:25.240- 10:30.300* :  So that is significant and at the same time and I think the timing is not unintentional about
*10:30.300- 10:36.220* :  these two things. We've had the first visit by Saudi Arabia's newly appointed non-resident
*10:36.220- 10:41.740* :  ambassador to the Palestinians. Now he's been in the occupied West Bank in Ramallah in the
*10:42.120- 10:47.360* :  seat of government of the Palestinian Authority, but this is the first such visit by Saudi
*10:47.360- 10:53.560* :  official in at least three decades. What is going on in the background here is that American
*10:53.560- 11:00.880* :  driven process to try and forge normalisation of relations would be a historic realignment of
*11:00.880- 11:06.020* :  diplomatic ties in the Middle East between two older adversaries, but it would effectively be a
*11:06.020- 11:11.380* :  three-way deal because the US would have to underwrite this and it would also very controversially
*11:11.760- 11:18.940* :  mean the US giving security guarantees to Saudi Arabia and one of the things that we understand
*11:18.940- 11:25.480* :  is in that shopping list from the Saudis is they want very advanced American weapons. They also
*11:25.480- 11:31.220* :  want very controversially the ability to enrich uranium for a civilian nuclear power program
*11:31.220- 11:36.600* :  in Saudi Arabia. All of that is the quid pro quo for them normalising ties with the Israelis.
*11:36.600- 11:41.680* :  Now these things are a very long way off. I think it's going to be at least months, but we've heard
*11:41.680- 11:47.180* :  increasing signals not least from the leaders of all three countries. This process is continuing.
*11:47.580- 11:52.560* :  Our Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman. Now have you ever done something you bitterly regret?
*11:52.560- 11:59.440* :  Well it seems many people have because one market is growing tattoo removal. The BBC's Elizabeth
*11:59.440- 12:05.360* :  Hodson has been finding out. On the sunny south case of England, Brighton hosts one of the UK's
*12:05.360- 12:10.500* :  biggest body art conventions. And above the home of the Tatooists needles at this year's event,
*12:10.500- 12:16.640* :  I chatted to one of Slovenia's top artists, Simona Borsner from Tauchi Tatoo. She says people
*12:16.640- 12:21.780* :  sometimes regret their tattoos because they followed trends which light clothes come and go.
*12:22.420- 12:28.540* :  I started doing 10 years ago and then it was really really popular to get an infinity sign
*12:29.480- 12:38.460* :  and the like bird silhouettes flying out of it and also a lot of letterings. And now after 10 years
*12:39.160- 12:45.400* :  people cover that up because it was a trend then and now it's not trendy anymore. So
*12:46.340- 12:53.380* :  I guess what I would recommend is just to get something that you really like, not something that
*12:53.380- 12:58.640* :  I don't know some famous person has. But not everyone puts that much thought into it and
*12:58.640- 13:03.260* :  getting a tattoo lasered off is an option. And as the procedures become more popular,
*13:03.260- 13:08.900* :  the technology has also got better. Says Dr. Dennis Das, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon and
*13:08.900- 13:16.000* :  Tatoo removal specialist. The newer technology is a picosecond and the Yag or Alexander
*13:16.000- 13:23.140* :  Wright laser. The newer technology delivers the energy in a much smaller time frame.
*13:23.440- 13:28.480* :  There's a lot more energy delivered to the tattoos so that we can destroy the tattoo more
*13:28.480- 13:34.340* :  effectively. It's easier to get a tattoo removed but it's still not cheap. Removery is the world's
*13:34.340- 13:39.960* :  biggest laser tattoo removal specialist and Joe Keltin is chief operating officer. Using my own
*13:39.960- 13:45.120* :  eight centimetre long full colour hummingbird as an example, I asked how much it would cost to remove.
*13:45.700- 13:51.840* :  For your tattoo it would be around two and a half thousand dollars and that would be around two
*13:51.840- 13:57.460* :  years to remove. So if you've got the cash what's the experience actually like? This is Kirk Diglis
*13:57.460- 14:02.920* :  take. Is the tattoo removal specialist attracted to at the tattoo convention? Hey there's a lot.
*14:03.200- 14:08.260* :  I'm not going to lie to you. I mean on a scale of one to ten I would say the pain level is probably
*14:08.260- 14:15.140* :  a good seminary. It's up there. What's the sensation like? Could you have got some tattoos yourself? Have
*14:15.140- 14:19.620* :  you ever had one laser doll? Yeah I've laser myself many times and I'm going to be perfectly honest
*14:19.620- 14:23.180* :  with you guys. You'll read a lot what it says it feels like an elastic band flicking
*14:23.180- 14:28.740* :  energy skin and it absolutely does not. It feels like when you're frying an egg and you get that spatter
*14:29.600- 14:34.240* :  not everyone who wants a tattoo removed regrets getting a massive back piece or someone's name.
*14:35.000- 14:40.600* :  Part of the industry specialises in medical tattooing. Back in 2021 Tanya Bucksdon found
*14:40.600- 14:45.260* :  the mastectomy tattooing allowance which raises funds to pay for people to have mastectomy
*14:45.260- 14:51.480* :  and ariella tattoos and a corner of medical tattooing also deals with removal. You have radiotherapy
*14:51.500- 14:56.360* :  as part of your breast cancer treatment they tattoo in tiny little dots it's like their markers
*14:56.680- 15:00.220* :  for their radiation markers obviously that's done at the hospital so they're quite
*15:01.040- 15:05.200* :  significant dots that look a bit bluey like then they're not very attractive dots to have.
*15:05.200- 15:09.700* :  Many people find it's you know it's a permanent reminder and a lot of people don't really want
*15:09.700- 15:14.840* :  those radiation dots there anymore. You can kind of tattoo that saline solution in to draw that
*15:14.840- 15:22.800* :  radiation dot tattoo out and you can also tattoo in like a colour corrective pigment colour to neutralise
*15:22.800- 15:27.840* :  the radiation dot colour and make it look like it's like a freckle kind of thing it's really clever
*15:27.840- 15:33.240* :  what you can do. People's reasons for having a tattoo removed a massively varied but whatever the
*15:33.240- 15:39.320* :  rational it definitely pays to do your research. Elizabeth Hotson reporting there.
*15:41.660- 15:46.940* :  Still to come. Unlike sharks that never stop growing new sets of teeth humans only get two sets.
*15:47.380- 15:52.420* :  But what if we could grow new teeth hope may be breaking through in Japan.
*15:57.540- 16:02.460* :  Suddenly my quilt is ripped off me and my room is full of white men and I thought I'm done for.
*16:02.460- 16:07.140* :  These are fascists they found where I live. Life's less ordinary as the podcast from the BBC
*16:07.140- 16:11.660* :  World Service bringing you extraordinary personal stories from around the globe.
*16:11.900- 16:17.540* :  betrayal. It runs through my life and runs through my story. I was just all alone in this vast
*16:17.540- 16:24.160* :  broken system. I never gave up my dream. Search for lives less ordinary wherever you get your BBC
*16:24.160- 16:33.280* :  podcasts. Next to Nagorno Karabakh as we heard in the earlier podcast a top US aid official has
*16:33.280- 16:38.660* :  called for international access to the region describing the testimonies of ethnic Armenians fleeing
*16:38.660- 16:44.640* :  the disputed territory as harrowing. Samantha Power promised nearly 12 million dollars in support
*16:44.640- 16:51.540* :  for them. Armenia says it's now received nearly 30,000 refugees from Karabakh who left fearing that
*16:51.540- 16:58.460* :  Azerbaijan might start ethnic cleansing. Armenia and Azerbaijan have discussed the situation at EU
*16:58.460- 17:04.340* :  back talks. I spoke to the BBC's Kairzornaji who's been seeing the refugees arrive in Armenia.
*17:04.840- 17:12.400* :  I am at this village called Kornizur which is the first village the refugees from Karabakh when
*17:12.400- 17:18.460* :  they come to Armenia they arrive at this village and in front of me there's a long stream of
*17:18.680- 17:25.020* :  cars with their lights on is dark here now but you can see it for for a mile I can see from where
*17:25.020- 17:30.800* :  I'm standing so they're still coming big numbers. I've been talking to quite a few of them in fact
*17:31.020- 17:37.780* :  they are days they are confused they are angry they are tired and they don't know
*17:38.200- 17:44.680* :  what is going to happen next many of them I talked to didn't know where they were going a lot of
*17:44.680- 17:51.140* :  them don't think they will ever go back to their homes. What are people saying to you about the
*17:51.140- 17:58.680* :  conditions in Nagorno Karabakh that has meant they've had to flee? A lot of shooting a lot of
*17:58.680- 18:07.400* :  insecurity a lot of explosions around them and all the reports of Azerbaijanis around them made
*18:07.400- 18:14.780* :  them pretty fearful and a lot of them decided to leave because of that when I asked them whether
*18:14.780- 18:21.000* :  they believed Azerbaijanis when Azerbaijanis say that they will guarantee their security
*18:21.720- 18:29.440* :  nobody said they will believe the Azerbaijanis don't forget the two sides have fought several wars
*18:29.440- 18:36.900* :  in the past three four decades and there is no trust at all between the two sides.
*18:37.420- 18:43.080* :  And Kassar to what extent is their concern within Armenia itself that what's happened in Nagorno
*18:43.080- 18:47.740* :  Karabakh may well not be the end of it? Oh there is quite a lot of concern on our front
*18:47.840- 18:55.420* :  because there are fears that there are Azerbaijan with the backing of Turkey has territorial ambitions
*18:55.920- 19:04.160* :  in Armenia and that is why people are particularly concerned Nicole Pasinian the prime minister
*19:04.520- 19:11.220* :  who was talking about this blaming Russia for what is happening in the last week or so
*19:11.220- 19:17.600* :  because Russian forces there were 20,000 of them were peacekeepers here were supposed to
*19:17.620- 19:24.120* :  peace a key piece but they looked the other way while the Azerbaijanis took over the land in Karabakh.
*19:24.700- 19:30.440* :  Kassar Naji in Armenia the British home secretary Suwala Bravaman has told a right-wing
*19:30.440- 19:35.740* :  think tank in Washington that the United Nations refugee convention which was drawn up after
*19:35.740- 19:41.380* :  the Second World War is no longer fit for the modern age she argued that uncontrolled an
*19:41.380- 19:47.300* :  irregular migration was an existential threat to the West and that fearing discrimination for being
*19:47.300- 19:51.860* :  gay or being a woman should not be enough to qualify for refugee protection.
*19:52.400- 19:58.440* :  There is an optimal level of immigration it is not zero there has been more migration to the UK
*19:58.440- 20:05.760* :  and Europe in the last 25 years than in all the time that went before it has been too much
*20:06.720- 20:12.520* :  too quick with too little thought given to integration and the impact on social cohesion.
*20:12.720- 20:19.040* :  If cultural change is too rapid and too big then what was already there is diluted unless
*20:19.040- 20:24.820* :  countries can prevent or rapidly remove illegal migrants pressures on the state will compound
*20:24.820- 20:31.380* :  over time. But the UK director of the human rights watch group Yasmine Armed says it is more
*20:31.380- 20:37.380* :  important than ever to support refugees and those who offer them protection. The debate should be
*20:37.380- 20:44.040* :  one rather than about how do we stop people from seeking protection how do we dilute our human
*20:44.040- 20:48.920* :  rights protections and the international conventions what we are saying very clearly is the debate
*20:48.920- 20:56.040* :  should be about how do we do global responsibility sharing how do we provide safe routes how do we
*20:56.040- 21:01.620* :  support the countries that host the most refugees in asylum seekers which are neighboring countries
*21:01.800- 21:08.420* :  once we undermine and unstrip the international system it means that we can no longer be saying to
*21:08.420- 21:15.240* :  Russia that you shouldn't be occupying Ukraine we can no longer say to China that you should not
*21:15.240- 21:21.660* :  be exerting any aggression in relation to Taiwan there are many many and extreme consequences of
*21:21.660- 21:28.160* :  the UK unpicking and undermining the international rules based order. Well the UK helped to shape the
*21:28.160- 21:33.880* :  United Nations Refugee Convention in the 1950s so what's the core of Ms Bravenman's argument against
*21:33.880- 21:39.500* :  it now I spoke to our political correspondent Rob Watson. At the core of her argument is just that
*21:39.500- 21:46.320* :  there are levels of legal immigration are too high but that also you're seeing such large movements
*21:46.320- 21:52.020* :  of people she says maybe the argument should go that you would tighten the definition of who
*21:52.020- 21:57.260* :  constitutes a refugee and her point being that her argument being that perhaps you should make it
*21:57.260- 22:02.080* :  clear there's a difference between persecution that would definitely entitle you to refugee status
*22:02.600- 22:07.520* :  but possibly not discrimination say for example she argued whether you were whether you were gay
*22:07.520- 22:11.920* :  or whether you were a woman and of course as you were hinting at there Nick what's really kind of
*22:11.920- 22:17.420* :  striking about how the modern conservative parties moved so much to the populist right it's worth
*22:17.420- 22:23.120* :  remembering that back in the 1950s when this was being debated it was Britain that was moving for
*22:23.120- 22:28.800* :  a sort of a wider and more universal definition of who would be a refugee. And Rob this speech was
*22:28.800- 22:33.860* :  made in Washington but it was mainly intended for a domestic audience wasn't absolutely I mean
*22:33.860- 22:38.700* :  I think the first important thing to say Nick is that Swallow Braverman believes this I mean she is
*22:39.260- 22:44.280* :  someone very much on the right of the modern conservative party very much on the right of European
*22:44.280- 22:49.340* :  politics you heard a clear line on immigration that there's been too much of it in Europe that
*22:49.340- 22:54.780* :  multiculturalism had failed as she put it but look I think there's it would be naive not to think
*22:54.780- 22:59.920* :  this was directed a domestic audience and no doubt having in mind that the conservatives the
*22:59.920- 23:04.180* :  governing conservative party a long way behind in the polls that not seems to have a good record
*23:04.180- 23:09.260* :  after 13 years of office have the thought being that maybe Swallow Braverman and others in the
*23:09.260- 23:15.260* :  conservative party will use these kind of values issues these culture war issues in order to perhaps
*23:15.660- 23:20.840* :  chip away at the opposition labor parties lead ahead of the expected general election next year.
*23:21.000- 23:26.100* :  And Rob there's no doubt it will be popular this redefinition of what is a refugee amongst certain
*23:26.540- 23:30.760* :  members of British society yes absolutely it'll certainly be popular in the governing
*23:30.760- 23:36.680* :  conservative party amongst its activists and MPs but the opinion polling does consistently suggest
*23:36.680- 23:42.200* :  that there is concern amongst that British voters are primarily conservative voters about the
*23:42.200- 23:48.520* :  levels of immigration in this country and asylum legal and illegal. Rob Watson well the UN
*23:48.520- 23:54.140* :  refugee agency has defended its convention on refugees after the comments made by Swallow Braverman
*23:54.140- 24:00.740* :  as we just heard she had suggested it was absurd and unsustainable and called for its reform it
*24:00.740- 24:06.540* :  said the convention had saved millions of lives. Imogen folks reports from Geneva the UN refugee
*24:06.540- 24:14.520* :  agency rejected the suggestion the convention on refugees first drafted in 1951 needs reform the
*24:14.520- 24:19.820* :  agency also questioned Swallow Braverman's distinction between persecution and discrimination
*24:20.060- 24:26.400* :  in relation to women or gay people saying it was crucial those at risk because of their gender
*24:26.400- 24:32.700* :  or sexual orientation could seek protection a better response to increased arrivals and the
*24:32.700- 24:39.900* :  asylum backlog the agency said would be faster decisions on asylum and safe legal routes for refugees.
*24:39.900- 24:45.960* :  Imogen folks here in London five people have appeared in court accused of being part of a
*24:45.960- 24:52.420* :  Russian spying operating from a hotel in Norfolk in eastern England the Bulgarian nationals are
*24:52.420- 24:58.320* :  allegedly conspired to gather information on behalf of the Kremlin between 2020 and February of
*24:58.320- 25:03.100* :  this year. Daniel de Simone followed proceedings at Westminster magistrates court.
*25:03.620- 25:08.500* :  The five Bulgarian nationals three men and two women have lived in Britain for years
*25:08.500- 25:13.500* :  some had apparently normal jobs including a beautician and laboratory assistant
*25:13.580- 25:20.020* :  but they're accused of secretly working as spies carrying out surveillance on places and people
*25:20.020- 25:27.140* :  targeted by Russia to apparently assist Moscow in carrying out hostile actions including potential
*25:27.140- 25:33.820* :  abductions. The alleged cell is said to have been run from the UK with members operating both
*25:33.820- 25:40.680* :  here and in Europe. One of the alleged spies Ivan Stoyanov is a one-time mixed martial arts fighter
*25:47.280- 25:54.300* :  known as the destroyer. It's alleged the spy cell's operations hub was a now closed seaside
*25:54.300- 26:00.860* :  guesthouse in Great Yarmouth occupied by one of the accused all in Rusev who said to have been
*26:00.860- 26:07.120* :  directed from abroad by a man known as Jan Maasleck. He's not charged and is wanted in Germany
*26:07.120- 26:12.980* :  in a major fraud case. He's now believed to be in Russia. The five defendants appeared in court
*26:12.980- 26:18.520* :  by video link. They've yet to enter please and were remanded in custody to appear at the old
*26:18.520- 26:24.600* :  Bayley next month. Daniel de Simone. The international criminal police organization Interpol has
*26:24.600- 26:31.600* :  issued a red notice for the arrest of the fugitive Venezuelan gang leader Ekto Gerero Flores who
*26:31.600- 26:36.400* :  escaped last week from a prison where he'd lived a life of luxury. He fled before the
*26:36.400- 26:42.420* :  arrival last Wednesday of 11,000 soldiers and police who regained control of the compound.
*26:42.980- 26:48.420* :  Alas, an American editor, Vanessa Bushluckda told us more about the wanted man Ekto Gerero Flores
*26:48.940- 26:56.940* :  known as the boy Gerero. He is the leader of a criminal enterprise called Tren der Aua. Tren der
*26:56.940- 27:05.040* :  Aua is a Venezuelan-based criminal gang which started by extorting locals and then extorting
*27:05.080- 27:09.920* :  migrants. There are many thousands and hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who've been leaving
*27:09.920- 27:16.100* :  the country. And then of course as those migrants left Venezuela the Tren der Aua also established
*27:16.200- 27:21.400* :  itself in the countries where these migrants went to. So they've been seen in Peru, in Chile,
*27:22.180- 27:28.620* :  in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela of course and Brazil. Now the leader Ekto Gerero Flores who's now
*27:28.620- 27:34.280* :  a free man at the moment somewhere we don't know where had been in prison. It wasn't any old prison
*27:34.280- 27:39.060* :  there was it. He pretty much ruled the roost. That's right. So he had been in and out of
*27:39.080- 27:46.160* :  Tocorón prison in Aragua State and Venezuela since 2010. And he constructed parts of this prison
*27:46.780- 27:52.080* :  into almost a luxury resort. There was a swimming pool, there was a makeshift bank,
*27:52.080- 27:59.220* :  there was a betting shop, a restaurant, a baseball diamond. There was even a petting zoo because a lot
*27:59.220- 28:04.560* :  of the inmates families actually moved into the prison because life there was more pleasant
*28:04.560- 28:10.600* :  than life on the outside. So during Venezuela's economic crisis there would be locals queuing to
*28:10.600- 28:17.220* :  get into the prison to get the basics from the inmates who sourced them from further afield.
*28:17.640- 28:22.360* :  And this was widely known, the authorities didn't seem to do much about it. It begs the question
*28:22.700- 28:26.600* :  why if it was so luxurious, why would he want to leave in the first place if he could carry on
*28:26.600- 28:31.900* :  running his empire from there? Exactly. Well, what some of the experts who know the inside of
*28:31.900- 28:36.120* :  this prison have said is the reason why he stayed in there for so long because he was able to
*28:36.300- 28:42.760* :  come and go as he wanted. He was once seen by police on the yacht during a luxurious carnival party
*28:43.240- 28:48.140* :  and he actually showed them a safe passage that he's been given by the prison authorities
*28:48.140- 28:55.740* :  that allowed him to come and go. The reason why he now escaped is that it seems like
*28:55.740- 29:02.080* :  President Maduro of Venezuela came under increased pressure from presidents in the region like
*29:02.080- 29:08.420* :  in Chile to do something about a trender agua, this gang that he led. And so he decided to conduct
*29:08.420- 29:15.280* :  a massive raid. He sent 11,000 soldiers and police into the prison to clear it and to regain control
*29:15.280- 29:22.300* :  of this penitentiary. And our man, Nino Guerrero, as he's known, he was tipped off to this so he left
*29:22.300- 29:28.200* :  just before. Vanessa Bush looked at there. Now in some countries, the tooth fairy or equivalent
*29:28.200- 29:34.020* :  rewards children for losing their baby teeth with money left under the pillow. After that,
*29:34.020- 29:38.760* :  if you happen to lose your adult teeth, there is no reward, of course, and it is a lot harder to fix.
*29:39.440- 29:44.720* :  But imagine if you could simply grow new teeth, it would be a world first if it makes it through
*29:44.720- 29:50.140* :  human clinical trials by there is hope in Japan. So you'd be hopped in reports. Unlike sharks that
*29:50.140- 29:55.440* :  never stop growing new sets of teeth, humans only get two sets. And if you damage your second adult
*29:55.440- 30:00.500* :  set, you don't really have many other options, then perhaps the toothless smile or paying for
*30:00.500- 30:05.660* :  expensive dentures or implants. But scientists at a pharmaceutical startup in Kyoto, Japan
*30:05.700- 30:09.820* :  have announced they plan to start human clinical trials for a drug that could help you
*30:10.180- 30:15.800* :  maybe grow some new incisors, canines and molars. They hope it will work by stimulating dormant
*30:15.800- 30:20.700* :  tooth buds that disappear once we have our full adult set. But don't stop brushing just yet,
*30:20.700- 30:25.440* :  as the trials won't start until next year, and then it could take several years for the drug to
*30:25.440- 30:31.060* :  reach the market. If it does, it will be the first of its kind. Dr. Katsu Takahashi, who is working on
*30:31.060- 30:35.960* :  the study, told local media that the idea of growing new teeth is every dentist's dream.
*30:36.420- 30:40.780* :  The team has already had some success growing new teeth in ferrets, which are both baby and
*30:40.780- 30:47.840* :  permanent teeth similar to humans. The world of mountain climbing is in a dilemma at the moment.
*30:47.840- 30:53.200* :  The legendary mountaineer, Reinhold Messner, has been stripped of two world records after a
*30:53.200- 30:58.060* :  researcher sitting at a desk using maps and satellite pictures, declared that Messner had in
*30:58.060- 31:04.160* :  fact missed the summit of Anna Perna I in the Himalayas by a few meters. It is apparently
*31:05.000- 31:10.000* :  easily done. The researcher has never visited the Himalayas, but did enough to persuade Guinness
*31:10.000- 31:16.080* :  world records that Messner messed up. The record for the first ascent of the world's 14 highest
*31:16.080- 31:23.680* :  peaks has now been awarded to an American, Ed Vastis. So it does seem odd that 38 years after
*31:23.680- 31:30.260* :  the actual climber and amateur cartographer, a continent away, can act as referee. Messner himself
*31:30.260- 31:36.520* :  says it's nonsense. Evan Davis spoke to the mountaineer Alan Arnett. He's climbed Mount Everest,
*31:36.520- 31:41.840* :  and in 2014 became the oldest American to summit K2, the world's second highest peak.
*31:42.320- 31:47.580* :  So does he think that Messner has been hard done by when his record has been taken away from him?
*31:48.000- 31:53.580* :  I think the overall situation doesn't really have a lot of point to it. If you talk to most people
*31:53.580- 31:58.160* :  who climb mountains, and I think Messner has said this himself, that he doesn't climb to make
*31:58.160- 32:03.420* :  records as set records. He climbs for the personal challenge. And I think that's how most people in
*32:03.420- 32:08.640* :  the mountaineering community feel about climbing. However, there are exceptions in the last, I guess,
*32:08.640- 32:16.320* :  handful of years with people seeking headlines and documentaries and all sorts of self-promotion
*32:16.320- 32:21.320* :  by way of setting records. What is most interesting about this, though, is the idea that you can
*32:21.320- 32:28.480* :  accidentally not make the peak. Now just tell me how easy is it to go up all that way and just get
*32:28.780- 32:34.180* :  the wrong little bit poking up? It's a really good question. You would think that you would climb
*32:34.180- 32:39.080* :  until there's no place to go. You ever hire. And by definition, now you're at the tallest point
*32:39.080- 32:43.500* :  of that mountain. But a lot of factors come into it. There's false summits where you have
*32:43.740- 32:49.800* :  ungulating ridge line. The one that was really in question for Mr. Messner was Anna Perna.
*32:50.060- 32:54.780* :  It has eight unique summits on it. And it's kind of a ridge that goes up and down, up and down.
*32:54.780- 32:58.820* :  And if it's really cloudy or if you're in a blizzard in a white out condition,
*32:58.820- 33:02.720* :  it's quite plausible that you think that you're at the very top, but you're not.
*33:03.320- 33:06.620* :  You know, I think that there's really two buckets here. There are people that make an honest
*33:06.620- 33:11.620* :  mistake. And then there are people that knowingly don't make the summit. And then they come back and
*33:11.620- 33:16.100* :  claim they did. And that's fraud. And I think that's where the root of all those countries.
*33:16.100- 33:20.660* :  But no one, no one is suggesting Messner did that. I mean, Messner didn't know. No, no, he didn't.
*33:20.940- 33:24.980* :  And he didn't presumably now. Don't you have, don't you have little devices telling you whether
*33:24.980- 33:30.380* :  you hit the peak or, I mean, you just have to rely on your eyes. Exactly. We have GPS devices
*33:30.380- 33:35.440* :  today, you know, satellite photography. We have high resolution maps that can, that you can look
*33:35.440- 33:40.440* :  on Google Earth on the internet and figure out where the true, the true summit is. But back in the
*33:40.440- 33:45.120* :  70s, when he was doing this, none of that technology was available. So really, it was up to the
*33:45.120- 33:48.820* :  individual climber to make that determination. Have you ever messed up? Have it climbed
*33:48.820- 33:52.900* :  amount and come back and something to actually you. You made the wrong bit there. No, the real
*33:52.900- 33:58.620* :  peaks over there. You know, I have not, but comparing someone like me to ride on Messner is
*33:58.620- 34:04.220* :  truly apples and airplanes. You know, I climbed with, I climbed with Sherpas. And in fact,
*34:04.220- 34:10.220* :  my own story in this room happened on Manusloo, another 8,000 meter mountain. I got to what I was
*34:10.220- 34:16.780* :  told was the true summit in 2013. And I was told by the the Sherpas who fixed the ropes in this
*34:16.780- 34:22.720* :  particular Sherpas had 20 summits of Everest. So I trusted him implicitly, only to find out
*34:22.720- 34:28.280* :  years later that, in fact, we had missed the true summit. And it was revealed by a drone footage
*34:28.280- 34:33.020* :  taken a couple of years ago that we addressed the four summit, not the true summit.
*34:33.560- 34:35.020* :  The mountaineer Alan Arnet.
*34:37.640- 34:41.460* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*34:41.600- 34:45.780* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*34:45.780- 34:52.340* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on X, formerly known as Twitter
*34:52.340- 34:58.240* :  at Global News Podcast. This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll. The producer was Liam McChephery,
*34:58.480- 35:02.060* :  the editor Karen Martin. I'm Nick Miles and until next time, goodbye.
