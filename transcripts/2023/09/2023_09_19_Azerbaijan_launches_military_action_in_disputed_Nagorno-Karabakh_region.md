*00:34.120- 00:38.520* :  13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 19th of September. These are our main stories.
*00:39.160- 00:44.180* :  Azerbaijan launches a military operation in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*00:44.680- 00:51.020* :  India and Canada each expel a diplomat in an escalating row over the murder of a Sikh separatist
*00:51.020- 00:56.700* :  leader. Ukraine attempts to send a ship loaded with grain across the Black Sea despite the collapse
*00:56.700- 01:05.040* :  of a safe passage deal with Russia. Also in this podcast, how much longer will X, the rebranded
*01:05.040- 01:09.820* :  version of Twitter remain free for those who don't want to pay? The single most important reason
*01:09.820- 01:15.860* :  that we're moving to having a small monthly payment for the use of the X system, it's the only way
*01:15.860- 01:20.340* :  I can think of to combat vast armies of bites. We'll get reaction from users.
*01:25.400- 01:31.040* :  Armenia and Azerbaijan have already fought two wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh
*01:31.040- 01:36.260* :  in the three decades since the end of the Soviet Union. Now, with reports of large-scale
*01:36.260- 01:42.380* :  shelling and continuous shooting, there are fears of a possible third conflict. Azerbaijan announced
*01:42.380- 01:48.260* :  was launching what it calls an anti-terror operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. It said it was a response
*01:48.260- 01:55.220* :  to land mine explosions that killed six people, which is blaming on Armenia. In footage posted online
*01:55.220- 02:01.260* :  by a journalist in a territory's regional capital, Stepanakert, the sound of gunfire can be heard.
*02:01.800- 02:14.140* :  Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, but most of the people who live
*02:14.140- 02:20.300* :  in the region are ethnically Armenian. Our correspondent in the region, Rehan Dimitri, told us more about
*02:20.300- 02:27.920* :  the military operation. The shelling started after Baku accused Armenia of what it called an
*02:27.920- 02:36.120* :  Armenian sabotage group for the two separate explosions that killed six Azerbaijani people earlier
*02:36.120- 02:42.900* :  today. Shortly after that, a statement appeared on Azerbaijan Defense Ministry's website saying that
*02:42.900- 02:48.920* :  it was launching and what it described as local anti-terrorist operation in order to
*02:49.520- 02:56.180* :  disarm Armenian armed forces and to demand the complete withdrawal of Armenian forces from its
*02:56.180- 03:01.500* :  territory. Armenian Defense Ministry also issued a statement and they have been saying this for
*03:01.500- 03:10.040* :  some time that they have no forces in Nagorno-Karabakh, that these are self-defense units of the ethnic
*03:10.040- 03:18.520* :  Armenian population that lives in Nagorno-Karabakh. So it's also kind of the situation is developing
*03:18.520- 03:26.260* :  quite intensely. The latest what I saw on the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry website was footage
*03:26.300- 03:33.760* :  showing what they said as targeting legitimate military targets and destroying them. So you've got
*03:33.760- 03:38.960* :  these conflicting claims with Azerbaijan saying that there are Armenian military units which is
*03:38.960- 03:46.040* :  attacking but Armenia denying this. That's correct. What we're seeing now is really the
*03:46.040- 03:54.020* :  combination of months of tensions and escalation. Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan is populated
*03:54.020- 04:01.280* :  by ethnic Armenians. They have been living under a blockade for nearly nine months because the only
*04:01.280- 04:08.100* :  route connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with the Republic of Armenia has been blocked by Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan
*04:08.140- 04:15.100* :  said that it was its sovereign right that finally it restored fully restored its territorial integrity.
*04:15.780- 04:23.660* :  However, this decision by Azerbaijan to block this only road went against the agreement that was
*04:23.660- 04:30.620* :  signed three years ago that ended a six-week war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, or Nagorno-Karabakh,
*04:31.480- 04:38.440* :  and as part of that agreement, Russian peacekeepers were deployed to this region. Well, we also heard
*04:38.440- 04:45.760* :  today just recently a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. Russia said that it was worried
*04:45.760- 04:53.060* :  by the escalation and called for the two sides to stop the bloodshed. Also, they said that it's
*04:53.060- 04:58.180* :  possible that the foreign ministers of Armenian Azerbaijan who are currently in New York for the
*04:58.180- 05:07.540* :  UN General Assembly might hold a meeting today. Rehan Demetri. An explosive allegation has caused a
*05:07.540- 05:13.160* :  diplomatic rail between Canada and India and led to tit-for-tat expulsions. As you may have heard
*05:13.160- 05:17.060* :  in our previous edition, Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau-Toe Parliament,
*05:17.060- 05:23.440* :  there were credible allegations linking the Indian government to the murder of a Canadian citizen
*05:23.440- 05:29.720* :  from the country's large Sikh community, Hardeep Singh Nija, who supported the creation of a Sikh
*05:29.720- 05:36.080* :  homeland in India. He was shot outside a temple in British Columbia in June. Both countries
*05:36.080- 05:42.340* :  have each expelled a diplomat with Delhi calling Mr. Trudeau's allegations absurd and politically
*05:42.340- 05:48.600* :  motivated. Just Karen Sandu from the World's Sikh Organization of Canada gave his reaction to
*05:48.600- 05:57.440* :  this stunning development. The assassination of a Canadian on Canadian soil is just a total
*05:57.440- 06:04.680* :  affront to Canada's sovereignty, to international law, to the norms in which we assume countries,
*06:04.680- 06:08.820* :  especially countries that build themselves as democracy, should behave.
*06:09.680- 06:14.820* :  Mr. Trudeau said he had raised this issue with the Indian leader Narendra Modi at the recent
*06:14.820- 06:20.600* :  G20 summit in Delhi. A former premier of British Columbia and Canadian Minister of Health,
*06:20.640- 06:26.480* :  Ujjal Dessange, said the Prime Minister should have given more information in his statement to Parliament.
*06:27.180- 06:32.160* :  He should have made public the evidence that they have to the extent they could.
*06:32.220- 06:39.060* :  Now, I'm assuming that they couldn't make any evidence public without darnishing the rest of
*06:39.060- 06:46.320* :  the evidence. It puts a damper on an international relationship, which is already in a cold storage
*06:46.740- 06:53.560* :  for some time. The US, Britain and Australia have all said they're deeply concerned by the Canadian
*06:53.560- 06:59.420* :  allegations. Our South Asia correspondent, Yugitra Lemay, told us more. That was a pretty
*06:59.420- 07:04.720* :  explosive allegation made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in his Parliament and what he said,
*07:04.720- 07:10.800* :  he's, he's had that sentence a fair bit, but what he said is that Canadian intelligence are
*07:10.800- 07:20.100* :  investigating credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the Indian government and
*07:20.100- 07:27.520* :  the death of Mr. Nijar. And you know, following that, he's said that he wants India's full cooperation
*07:27.520- 07:33.480* :  to investigate this incident fully. And if it poses a really serious allegation that India would
*07:33.480- 07:38.620* :  have done something on foreign territory, committed an act of violence on foreign territory,
*07:38.620- 07:44.560* :  following that we also had Canada expel a senior Indian diplomat. Just, you know, at the core of
*07:44.560- 07:51.580* :  these allegations is Mr. Nijar, who was shot dead by to an identified gunman on the 18th of June.
*07:52.140- 08:00.400* :  Mr. Nijar was a prominent Sikh leader. He publicly campaigned for a separate homeland for Sikhs
*08:00.840- 08:09.240* :  in the Punjab region of India. And India has had big problems with anyone saying that and has been
*08:09.240- 08:13.580* :  taking it up with Canada as well. And then, you know, the relations that bring these two countries
*08:13.580- 08:19.660* :  have been streamed. We saw that during the G20 summit, ties extremely frosty. Justin Trudeau
*08:19.660- 08:25.080* :  didn't attend the president's dinner for all of the diplomats and all of the delegates. But this,
*08:25.080- 08:32.080* :  you know, it's taken another severe turn today. And India is strongly refuting these allegations.
*08:33.040- 08:37.740* :  Yes, I mean, as you said, they've called them absurd and motivated. They've also said that this
*08:37.740- 08:45.200* :  is Canada's attempt to shift focus from long, standard concerns that India has been raising,
*08:45.200- 08:51.600* :  that people who live within the territory of Canada are talking about separatism and campaigning
*08:51.600- 08:56.820* :  for a separate state within the territory of India. And this challenges the territorial integrity
*08:57.280- 09:02.660* :  and sovereignty of India. And also reacting to the expulsion of the Indian diplomat from Canada,
*09:02.660- 09:08.680* :  India then summoned the Canadian High Commissioner and a senior Canadian diplomat has also been
*09:08.680- 09:13.440* :  expelled. He's had, he has five days to leave the country. And in that statement, the Ministry of
*09:13.440- 09:17.600* :  Foreign Affairs in India has said they've got growing concerns about the interference of Canadian
*09:17.600- 09:24.860* :  diplomats in what they describe as anti-India activity. And this all comes at a time when Western
*09:24.860- 09:31.240* :  nations have been wooing India as a counterweight to China. What are the repercussions of this
*09:31.260- 09:36.600* :  likely to be for Delhi? So, well, we've had a statement from the National Security Council
*09:36.600- 09:41.160* :  of the White House saying that they're extremely concerned about these allegations. Justin Trudeau
*09:41.160- 09:46.900* :  mentioned that he has shared this with allies without stating exactly who. India has also been
*09:46.900- 09:51.140* :  discussing these matters with the UK because, you know, there've also been instances in the UK
*09:51.140- 09:56.640* :  of public campaigns for a separate Sikh homeland. You know, at the moment it's unclear, as you said,
*09:56.640- 09:59.600* :  because of India's growing prominence on the global stage.
*10:00.440- 10:06.520* :  Yugi Tert Lemay. A ship carrying grain has left Ukrainian port on the Black Sea for the first time
*10:06.520- 10:12.560* :  since the collapse of a UN-backed deal with Russia. Grain from both countries is crucial to global
*10:12.560- 10:19.240* :  food supplies, and the deal had helped to slow rising food prices. Kyiv says it's created a humanitarian
*10:19.240- 10:25.460* :  corridor to allow the movement of ships, but Russia says any vessels traveling out of Ukraine
*10:25.460- 10:31.460* :  could be treated as military targets. Are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse sent this report?
*10:32.360- 10:37.680* :  It's clear that both Kyiv and the shipping companies and the shipping insurers are keen to take
*10:37.680- 10:46.280* :  risks still. The site of resilient Africa, making her way out with 3,000 tons of Ukrainian grain,
*10:46.280- 10:52.840* :  is quite a site given the environment that surrounds this vessel. We have mine infested seas,
*10:52.840- 10:59.160* :  we have the Russian Navy which still exerts dominance, but it's also important to reiterate that
*10:59.160- 11:04.280* :  this isn't the grain deal of old, the year-long agreement which allowed Ukraine to export
*11:04.300- 11:10.500* :  two-thirds of what it once did, 30 million tons of grain or so. We're talking about two vessels
*11:10.500- 11:17.660* :  making this route out of Ukraine in as many months, so it really is a fraction of what Ukraine is
*11:17.660- 11:21.620* :  able to do, but it's interesting that I think Kyiv wants to make a bit of a statement here.
*11:22.060- 11:28.480* :  It's announced this corridor without any buy-in from Russia, without any ability to enforce this
*11:28.480- 11:34.040* :  corridor or police it themselves because of the dominance that Russia currently enjoys,
*11:34.840- 11:39.560* :  and yet it's willing to test those boundaries. We saw a cargo vessel that was trapped on the
*11:39.560- 11:45.640* :  coast make its way out last month. That was intercepted by Russian forces, they loaded it,
*11:45.720- 11:50.560* :  they boarded it via helicopter and carried out an inspection, but that vessel ultimately made
*11:50.560- 11:55.260* :  its way through. And what we've learned with this grain corridor is that it's about confidence,
*11:55.420- 12:01.740* :  so I think what Ukraine is hoping is if enough vessels make it out without a hitch, then more will
*12:01.740- 12:09.000* :  follow and it will both help its faltering economy and also address the lingering threat of a global
*12:09.000- 12:16.560* :  food crisis with Ukraine being one of the world's major suppliers of the stuff. So this is a statement,
*12:16.560- 12:22.040* :  but it's incredibly early days and I think any hopes of Russia either coming back to the table
*12:22.040- 12:26.920* :  or trying to resurrect this deal remains slim because of what is happening in this war, where we
*12:26.920- 12:31.940* :  have Russia getting bogged down on the battlefield and where the Kremlin is continuing to hammer
*12:32.400- 12:38.140* :  Ukrainian ports and infrastructure with missile strikes. So it's a very strange juxtaposition
*12:38.140- 12:42.680* :  to see this vessel make its way out, but it's made its way out, never the less.
*12:43.200- 12:49.480* :  James Waterhouse, astronaut Frank Rubio has broken the US record for the longest space mission.
*12:49.980- 12:54.680* :  This time next week the US Army veteran would have been on board the International Space Station
*12:54.680- 13:01.620* :  for a year. His stay was extended because of a technical problem. Rubio himself has described the
*13:01.620- 13:08.220* :  experience as psychologically a little bit of a challenge. The retired NASA astronaut Nikol Stott
*13:08.420- 13:13.140* :  told my colleague Rob Young how it feels to live and work in space.
*13:13.800- 13:19.140* :  I imagine there's probably a range of feelings and I don't know the experience up there is wonderful.
*13:19.640- 13:24.460* :  I mean in the end I think when he reflects on it there will be gratitude for having that
*13:24.460- 13:29.120* :  amount of time in that place where everything we're doing up there in this international
*13:29.180- 13:33.680* :  partnership like none we've ever seen before is ultimately about improving life on Earth.
*13:34.020- 13:40.060* :  I just wonder the longer you spend up there does that no doubt initially spectacular view of Earth
*13:40.060- 13:46.500* :  just become something every day and and humdrum. I don't think so and you know I worried about
*13:46.500- 13:50.680* :  that before I flew was like wow am I just going to fly by the window and think hey you know there's
*13:50.680- 13:56.660* :  Earth but it did not it surprises you every time you look at the window I think you are drawn to
*13:56.660- 14:01.880* :  it in a way that maybe is just part of us being human and knowing that that's our planetary home
*14:02.700- 14:09.200* :  and you want to be in a window just sucking it in and I can tell you I found myself there
*14:09.880- 14:15.180* :  and I'm I'm betting Frank is even more and more now looking at it like you know just wow
*14:15.840- 14:20.920* :  having to set the alarm to remind myself to go back to work because of how it is just such a
*14:20.920- 14:26.840* :  transcendent feeling. And when you're up there in that weightlessness for a very long period of time
*14:27.740- 14:31.980* :  what happens to your muscles? Do you have to work out to maintain your strength?
*14:32.480- 14:37.760* :  Absolutely we work out two hours a day a maybe two hours a day you know I came back in better shape
*14:37.760- 14:42.540* :  than I was before I left as well as two hours a day to work out but it's absolutely necessary
*14:42.540- 14:47.700* :  for us to do that and it's why the scientists love us up there as kind of the human subject is
*14:47.700- 14:53.880* :  we're essentially in an accelerated aging process and so every system in our body is impacted
*14:53.880- 14:59.920* :  in some way certainly muscles and bone are one of the most obvious things that that we can measure
*14:59.920- 15:08.760* :  very quickly and see and it's pretty impressive how fast we can lose bone and muscle like almost
*15:08.760- 15:12.360* :  right off the back because your brain and your body figures out hey I don't need bones in muscle to
*15:13.000- 15:16.840* :  be a floaty person you know moving around in three dimensions without any load on my body.
*15:17.200- 15:20.640* :  What's the food like after a time does it get a bit boring?
*15:21.320- 15:25.460* :  You know there's it's very different to how we eat down here it's all packaged well I don't know
*15:25.460- 15:31.940* :  some of us might eat that way but it's all just flavoured. Package you know it's not it's it's food
*15:31.940- 15:38.240* :  that comes back to life when you add water to it and what I loved about the way we eat on the station
*15:38.240- 15:44.960* :  is that there's food from all of the international partners on board and I don't know I love the
*15:44.960- 15:51.320* :  Japanese curries and even there's a local chocolate shop that my husband had some delicious chocolate
*15:51.320- 15:58.580* :  covered ginger sent to us so nice variety. Retired NASA astronaut Nikol start giving us an insight
*15:58.580- 16:05.980* :  into life in space. Still to come on the global news podcast. People lying back on mattresses
*16:06.360- 16:11.540* :  reading books I've heard people of these competitions saying that they have parties but they
*16:11.540- 16:19.340* :  dance lying down. Why people in Montenegro are competing for the title of the laziest citizen.
*16:25.440- 16:30.820* :  I had just come out of one of my bare knuckle boxing matches I don't know why but the first
*16:30.820- 16:36.740* :  thing that came to my brain was what if I do a drag show. Remarkable personal stories told by the
*16:36.740- 16:42.160* :  people that lived them. I could easily have pulled that trigger but that was not my brief I was not
*16:42.160- 16:48.620* :  an assassin I was not told to do that I was not told to murder him. Live's less ordinary from the BBC
*16:48.620- 16:57.780* :  world service find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the global news podcast
*16:57.820- 17:03.960* :  since taking over the social media platform X formerly known as Twitter last year Elon Musk has
*17:03.960- 17:09.800* :  tried to incentivise users to pay for an enhanced service. That's failed to take off as Mr
*17:09.800- 17:15.260* :  Musk had hoped with the company losing some of the advertising revenue it relies on amid accusations
*17:15.260- 17:21.180* :  that he's presided over a surge in anti-Semitic content. In a meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister
*17:21.180- 17:27.600* :  Benjamin Netanyahu the billionaire has now suggested that all users of X may have to pay to use
*17:27.600- 17:32.820* :  the service saying that this was the only way to get rid of fake accounts. I say that maybe the
*17:32.820- 17:39.380* :  single most important reason that we're moving to having a small monthly payment for use of the
*17:39.380- 17:46.080* :  X system is it's it's the only way I could think of to combat vast armies of bots. But some on X
*17:46.080- 17:51.520* :  have joked that after having paid too much for the platform Mr Musk now wants to make users do
*17:51.520- 17:56.740* :  the same. So how seriously should we take his remarks about a possible paywall? I've been speaking
*17:56.740- 18:01.820* :  through our business reporter Monica Miller. It's questionable whether this was a comment that
*18:01.820- 18:07.840* :  was made off the cuff or maybe this is something that is part of his bigger plan. One thing that he
*18:07.840- 18:13.540* :  has had a very hard time doing since taking it over is making any money off of it. When you look
*18:13.540- 18:20.660* :  at what social media platforms like Alphabet make or meta in YouTube you know they have seen their
*18:20.660- 18:27.080* :  ad revenue start to skyrocket. But really X formerly known as Twitter has really had a hard time
*18:27.080- 18:34.640* :  to make a go of it. So one option he has is to monetize it. There is a premium plan which is worth
*18:34.640- 18:39.760* :  about eight US dollars and you get a couple extra things. But a lot of people scoffed at the idea
*18:39.760- 18:44.620* :  of having to pay for something that was already free. And Mr. Musk is a big proponent of free
*18:44.620- 18:50.140* :  speech. So there's a lot of risk that would come with this if it happens. Absolutely because it could
*18:50.140- 18:56.560* :  drive users away and he could lose even more advertising revenue. Indeed in fact a lot of advertising
*18:56.560- 19:02.260* :  firms are already on the fence about this because you would lose a bunch of free eyeballs essentially
*19:02.260- 19:08.020* :  and users who have this. But many people have been turned off by some of Mr. Musk's political
*19:08.020- 19:14.140* :  statements and find that this is becoming some people's words a very toxic place for discussion
*19:14.200- 19:20.260* :  and have been looking elsewhere. So it really advertises especially people who say sell bread and
*19:20.260- 19:27.240* :  butter goods. This isn't a place that they want to do business. It's interesting that he chose to
*19:27.240- 19:32.460* :  speak out in a forum with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because there's been a
*19:32.460- 19:39.040* :  lot of controversy over soaring anti-Semitism on X. And in fact Mr. Musk has threatened to sue
*19:39.040- 19:45.460* :  a group that raised this issue. Indeed you know the platform that has been accused by the prominent
*19:45.460- 19:52.300* :  anti-deformation league which is a Jewish organization. They have said that Mr. Musk has not
*19:52.300- 19:58.480* :  done enough to stop anti-Semitic content. And you know Mr. Musk has said that he is against
*19:58.480- 20:03.500* :  anti-Semitism which he said in front of President Netanyahu during their live stream.
*20:04.500- 20:10.340* :  But Mr. Musk has also been criticized for all kinds of things including saying some rather
*20:10.340- 20:17.940* :  derogatory things against George Soros. Now Mr. Netanyahu had said that he accepted that Mr. Musk
*20:17.940- 20:22.940* :  basically has a hard thing to balance here between free speech and content moderation and that
*20:22.940- 20:29.780* :  really it's a challenge that he urged Mr. Musk to strike right. And a lot of critics say that
*20:29.960- 20:35.840* :  the simple problem is that Mr. Musk overpaid. He paid more than 40 billion dollars to buy
*20:35.900- 20:43.200* :  Twitter as it was then. X is it is now. What do we know about the state of X's finances right now?
*20:43.480- 20:48.920* :  I do remember when our colleague James Clayton did sit down with Eli and Musk and had asked him
*20:48.920- 20:54.180* :  about that. And one of the things that Mr. Musk had pointed out was that you know when you went
*20:54.180- 20:58.380* :  into this he had absolutely no idea how saddled and dead it was and that there were some real
*20:58.380- 21:04.160* :  structural issues and one of the things he did was he had massive layoffs you know as he tried to
*21:04.160- 21:09.760* :  write the ship. Where it stands now you know we haven't heard very much lately they did bring on
*21:09.760- 21:16.100* :  a new chief to kind of deal with the day to day because Mr. Musk had been you know seen by many
*21:16.100- 21:23.080* :  people as being distracted from some of his other his enterprises and they have tried many different
*21:23.080- 21:26.660* :  things and maybe this is the new thing that will actually make them make some money.
*21:26.880- 21:31.560* :  Yeah do you think it could work? I was just having a discussion with someone that said you know
*21:31.560- 21:35.520* :  look it sounds crazy that you would have to have someone pay for something they've had free
*21:35.520- 21:41.520* :  for all this time but yet again if X does it well does that mean that Facebook will do it or
*21:41.540- 21:47.860* :  other free social media platforms will do it. You just never know it might be crazy enough I did
*21:47.860- 21:54.040* :  work. Monica Miller some of Spain's female footballers are still insisting that they're boycotting
*21:54.040- 21:59.480* :  their national team despite the appointment of its first female manager. 15 members of the
*21:59.480- 22:04.360* :  World Cup winning team were included in a squad but not Jenny Amoso who was kissed by the then
*22:04.360- 22:11.280* :  Spanish FABOS Luis Rubiales. Following weeks of controversy he finally resigned but despite
*22:11.280- 22:18.220* :  this several players say they do not yet feel in a safe place. This comes as the England captain
*22:18.220- 22:24.100* :  and Arsenal player Lear Williamson is due to address the UN in New York to appeal for a level
*22:24.100- 22:30.620* :  playing field for women and girls to take part in sport around the world. She told my colleague Nick
*22:30.620- 22:37.180* :  Robinson how the invitation came about. Recently I went to visit a programme that Arsenal
*22:37.180- 22:41.700* :  rummaged save a children called coaching for life at my Syrian refugee camp in Jordan and
*22:41.700- 22:48.320* :  Zattery and yeah I've come to talk about it talk about what I saw and who I met and how I think
*22:48.320- 22:54.900* :  we need to help them and what I think our responsibility is to them. You believe I think that football has
*22:54.900- 23:01.080* :  a power to liberate girls to liberate women to improve their lives. I do I think it's one of the
*23:01.080- 23:07.700* :  easiest things to get involved in it only has benefits for the person involved and I think naturally
*23:07.820- 23:12.240* :  it is one of those things that we've been previously banned and told that we shouldn't be
*23:12.240- 23:16.600* :  involved in so I think every time a woman steps out to do that she's demonstrating bravery and
*23:17.140- 23:22.600* :  determination to change what she's always sort of been dealt. So what did you see? What did you hear
*23:22.600- 23:27.560* :  in that Syrian refugee camp that convinced you it made a difference? When the programmes start
*23:27.560- 23:32.120* :  five years ago they were in singular figures of the amount of girls involved and now we have
*23:32.160- 23:37.260* :  an equal number of boys and girls in the programme which I think in a social environment such as
*23:37.260- 23:43.580* :  that is incredible may have self-confidence they have the bravery to express what they believe in
*23:43.580- 23:48.020* :  and encourage themselves and each other to think on their own and make their own future instead
*23:48.020- 23:53.660* :  of being dictated by the men in society and amongst all the despair whilst we try and figure out
*23:53.660- 23:58.800* :  how to help people I think football gives us hope and I think it's about looking after the human
*23:58.800- 24:04.960* :  being whilst we try and change the circumstances of which they live. That image overshadowed the
*24:04.960- 24:10.560* :  women's world cup sadly for many the image of that kiss by the Spanish F.A. President
*24:11.280- 24:17.060* :  for you was it a reminder of how far we have to go? Let's see exact kind of thing that drives me
*24:17.060- 24:24.620* :  to be here today and protect but also to facilitate and figure out how we create a future, a safe
*24:24.620- 24:28.980* :  future for women and young girls to be whoever they want to be and if they want to sport to do that
*24:28.980- 24:33.080* :  then yeah they need an environment that welcomes them and is safe for them to do that.
*24:33.560- 24:37.920* :  And have you ever encountered maybe years ago attitudes like that?
*24:38.600- 24:43.100* :  It would be rare to find somebody of my generation that hasn't and they're still about today
*24:43.100- 24:50.380* :  so the fight is long from over but I think where we've maybe confused resilience with
*24:50.380- 24:56.800* :  conditioned and conditioned behaviour I choose now to be resilient I will not continue to accept
*24:56.800- 25:01.440* :  the behaviour that we've been conditioned to believe we're only right to. There is no real reason
*25:01.440- 25:05.380* :  for any young girl to not be involved in football that's what it stems from and that's what we
*25:05.380- 25:09.440* :  all face to get where we are today so whilst I'm on a platform that I'm on I will try and make
*25:09.440- 25:14.960* :  it any easier future for anyone coming after me. England and Arsenal footballer Lear Williamson.
*25:15.700- 25:21.020* :  Now imagine being able to win a thousand dollars just by staying in bed. As a prize on offer
*25:21.020- 25:27.400* :  at Montenegro's laziest citizen competition where contestants have now broken the previous record
*25:27.400- 25:32.320* :  of 24 days our bookens correspondent Gai Deloni told us more.
*25:32.840- 25:37.900* :  This has now been running for 12 years this competition and it's an effort to mock regional
*25:37.900- 25:44.620* :  stereotypes by embracing them if you will and it's been set up by the owner of a small holiday camp
*25:44.620- 25:50.580* :  in the village of Donia Bresna. This is a woman called Radoena Blagoyevich. She was tired of this
*25:50.580- 25:55.700* :  particular stereotype that gets repeated around the western Balkans that have all the different
*25:55.700- 26:00.680* :  countries and peoples in the former Yugoslavia that Montenegro's are the laziest of the lot.
*26:01.040- 26:06.300* :  How did this stereotype come about? It's pervasive let's put it that way. When I spoke to my son
*26:06.300- 26:11.420* :  about this who is not in any way of this region but lives here and he just laughed and he said
*26:11.420- 26:16.260* :  well everyone knows that Montenegro's a laziest. So you don't have to be from this region to have
*26:16.260- 26:21.660* :  heard the stereotype and when the Prime Minister of Montenegro Dritt and Abazovic was at the
*26:21.660- 26:27.160* :  blood strategic forum here in Slovenia last month he described Montenegro as a country of
*26:27.160- 26:32.100* :  son and son to much laughter from the audience and the other regional leaders on the panel.
*26:32.400- 26:36.400* :  You know this is the kind of stereotype that's been going around for ages and used to have this
*26:36.400- 26:41.840* :  in Yugoslavia. If Montenegro's were lazy, Bosnians were idiots and Slovenians were cheap.
*26:42.200- 26:45.800* :  That was the kind of stereotype that was put around. There's even the Slovenian philosopher,
*26:45.800- 26:51.500* :  Slovo Gijek says, this was evidence of a healthy society that people were self-deprecating
*26:51.860- 26:55.540* :  about their regional characteristics. These days it feels rather less like that.
*26:56.040- 27:00.100* :  Well there's any being humorous about it. So Joseph has contest works.
*27:00.980- 27:05.440* :  So you've just got to lie back and think of Montenegro and that's it and they'll all
*27:05.440- 27:10.260* :  you've got to do and I'm sure you can find the images online, people lying back on mattresses,
*27:10.620- 27:15.220* :  reading books as some of them doing very subtle little exercises while they're lying down just
*27:15.220- 27:20.100* :  to make sure that limbs don't fall off or anything like that. But basically you're not allowed
*27:20.100- 27:25.780* :  to sit or stand up. You're only allowed to go for a toilet break once every eight hours.
*27:26.280- 27:31.700* :  I've heard people at these competitions saying that they have parties but they dance lying down
*27:31.700- 27:36.960* :  and I have to tell you it's not as onerous as it used to be. When this first started 12 years ago,
*27:36.960- 27:41.860* :  the rule was there was no getting up, no going to the toilet so it was really about
*27:41.860- 27:47.560* :  who had the strongest bladder rather than who was the laziest. It's not just Montenegro's taking
*27:47.560- 27:51.740* :  part in this. I think it could catch on in quite a lot of countries, isn't it? As the fame of the
*27:51.740- 27:56.700* :  competition has spread internationally, it's attracted international competitors from countries
*27:56.700- 28:02.420* :  like Russia and Ukraine but I have to tell you that the favourite for this year's competition I have
*28:02.420- 28:08.860* :  heard on the grapevine is a 21-year-old man from Serbia and he's one of five contestants now
*28:08.860- 28:14.520* :  remaining as it goes into its second month. Guadalorny, now, one woman who certainly wouldn't win
*28:14.520- 28:20.400* :  the laziest citizen title is Katy Perry. The singer may have sent a new record for this year after
*28:20.400- 28:28.540* :  selling a bundle of her back catalog for a reported $225 million. Stephanie Prenches has the details.
*28:37.000- 28:42.940* :  The cherry chapstick celebrating anthem I kissed a girl that put Katy Perry on the map as a global
*28:42.940- 28:49.100* :  pop star back in 2008 and is now part of the bundle sold to the highest bidder.
*28:51.500- 28:57.380* :  And the highest bidder is said to have deep pockets with multiple sources saying the sale
*28:57.380- 29:05.500* :  topped $225 million. The deal included her hugely popular second single from the one of the boys album.
*29:12.960- 29:18.700* :  As well as the four other albums she released with capital records. Yes, that means the
*29:27.980- 29:31.620* :  multi-platinum firework is in there. And her much celebrated ode to young love.
*29:40.360- 29:47.060* :  Along with 14 other multi-platinum hits. It's reportedly the biggest catalog deal for a single
*29:47.060- 29:53.400* :  artist this year and means the buyer litmus music on the master recordings and publishings and
*29:53.400- 30:01.800* :  can collect any future royalties. The deal means Katy trumps just in Bieber. He sold his back catalog
*30:01.800- 30:09.340* :  in January for a smaller amount, a mere $200 million. Selling music rights has become big business
*30:09.340- 30:15.420* :  in recent years with artists like Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Shakira swapping their royalties for
*30:15.420- 30:22.460* :  nine figure payouts. All in a day's work for the ultimate California girl.
*30:29.060- 30:35.360* :  That report by Stephanie Prentice. And that's all for us for now but there will be a new edition
