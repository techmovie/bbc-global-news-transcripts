*00:25.440- 00:33.300* :  podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janak Jaleil,
*00:33.300- 00:39.100* :  and on Thursday, the 21st of September, these are our main stories. As Abijan has held peace talks
*00:39.100- 00:44.780* :  with ethnic Armenian separatists after seizing control of the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*00:45.400- 00:50.240* :  India has halted visa services for Canadians as a diplomatic route between the two countries
*00:50.240- 00:57.000* :  intensifies. Poland says it's no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine as it's focusing on building
*00:57.000- 01:12.500* :  up its own defenses. Also in this podcast, in a speech to the French parliament, Britain's King
*01:12.500- 01:16.140* :  Charles praises the historic ties between the two countries.
*01:20.440- 01:26.000* :  We start in Azerbaijan, where after two days of fighting in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh,
*01:26.160- 01:31.500* :  a delegation representing ethnic Armenians has been holding peace talks with the Azeri government.
*01:31.500- 01:36.500* :  They've been discussing how to integrate the region as part of a ceasefire agreement
*01:36.500- 01:42.680* :  after Armenian separatists were forced to surrender when Azerbaijan sent its forces in this week.
*01:42.700- 01:49.100* :  The president of Azerbaijan says they now have full control of Nagorno-Karabakh after decades of
*01:49.100- 01:56.240* :  dispute with Armenia, which has twice flared into full-blown war. More than 100,000 ethnic
*01:56.240- 02:00.720* :  Armenians are estimated to live in Nagorno-Karabakh. For speaking before the talks,
*02:00.720- 02:05.840* :  Elgin Amibayov, a special representative of Azerbaijan, contested that number.
*02:06.180- 02:12.920* :  As to the number of residents in Karabakh region, I think the figure of 120,000 is highly exaggerated.
*02:13.560- 02:20.220* :  The real number of Armenian residents, including 10,000 of armed forces, is now no more than 50,000.
*02:21.040- 02:25.340* :  With the first round of talks now wrapped up, I asked our caucuses correspondent Rehan Dmitry
*02:25.340- 02:31.820* :  what, if anything, had come out of them. Unfortunately, not much. There have been a couple of comments
*02:31.900- 02:37.700* :  from Elgin Amibayov, whose clip you just played. He's a Azerbaijani president's representative,
*02:38.480- 02:44.220* :  and he just said that there are a lot of issues that need to be discussed, a lot of problems,
*02:44.220- 02:50.480* :  and just having one meeting is not enough. He said that there will be many more meetings
*02:50.480- 02:56.460* :  to discuss the process of integration of ethnic Armenians into Azerbaijan. He also said that,
*02:56.460- 03:03.100* :  based on these talks, there's a prospect now of signing a peace agreement with the Republic of
*03:03.100- 03:11.220* :  Armenia, and that Azerbaijan sent this draft documents to Armenia already. The big question now
*03:11.220- 03:18.080* :  is what is going to happen to the population of ethnic Armenians, whether or not they will be
*03:18.080- 03:25.780* :  given a choice to stay or to leave. In his comments, the representative of the Azerbaijani
*03:25.780- 03:32.720* :  president said that there are no talks of repatriation for the ethnic Armenians, and that now it is
*03:32.720- 03:40.420* :  an internal matter of Azerbaijan. We also heard from the Armenian side, from the Prime Minister's office
*03:40.420- 03:47.720* :  saying that, of course, Armenia would be ready to receive any refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh.
*03:48.100- 03:52.680* :  It doesn't bode well that the representative is saying that the real number of Armenians in the
*03:52.680- 03:59.500* :  enclave is less than half of the official figure, that there are real fears of a refugee crisis,
*04:00.300- 04:06.500* :  and some people are saying that Azerbaijan has basically been emboldened by Russia's example in Ukraine.
*04:08.040- 04:13.020* :  It has absolutely rights, but anything in that disputed territory,
*04:13.020- 04:20.680* :  Janate is disputed, even the number of people who live there, the names of places, and so on.
*04:20.960- 04:30.040* :  Of course, Russia has played a role in helping to negotiate the ceasefire, which ended with Karabakh
*04:30.040- 04:36.700* :  Armenian government surrendering to Azerbaijan. And Russia says that it is now helping with the
*04:36.700- 04:44.080* :  humanitarian crisis, and that it helped about 5,000 refugees who were escaping from the villages that
*04:44.080- 04:49.960* :  are on the front line. Rehan Dmitry. To Poland, where the government says it's still carrying out
*04:49.960- 04:55.500* :  previously agreed deliveries of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. The statement was issued
*04:55.500- 05:00.980* :  a day after the Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Murayewski, said his country was no longer supplying
*05:00.980- 05:06.960* :  arms to its neighbour as it looks to focus on its own defences. His comments marked another step
*05:06.960- 05:12.340* :  in the worsening relationship between the two nations. Poland, along with Slovakia and Hungary,
*05:12.340- 05:18.020* :  has banned imports of Ukrainian grain. This prompted the Ukrainian President, Vladimir Zelensky,
*05:18.020- 05:23.460* :  to complain that some countries were only pretending to support the war against Russia.
*05:24.240- 05:29.240* :  Our correspondent in Warsaw, Adamistin, told us why the Polish Prime Minister had made this
*05:29.240- 05:34.080* :  announcement now. Well, this was an interview that the Prime Minister Mateusz Murayewski gave to
*05:34.080- 05:40.480* :  the private broadcast of Polsat News, in which it was mainly about relations with Ukraine. And as
*05:40.480- 05:46.060* :  you mentioned, the grain embargo that Poland has extended, it's not accepting any Ukrainian grain
*05:46.060- 05:51.300* :  ostensibly to stop a flood of cheaper Ukrainian grain entering the country and
*05:51.920- 05:57.500* :  undercutting the price of Polish grain because we do have an election in October and the government
*05:57.500- 06:02.420* :  is counting on the rural vote, the vote of farmers to win that election. So it's trying to protect
*06:02.420- 06:09.100* :  its farmers. And there's certainly some disquiet amongst the Polish government officials that
*06:09.100- 06:14.820* :  President Zelensky, at the Year of the United Nations General Assembly, appeared to suggest that
*06:14.820- 06:21.700* :  this grain embargo is supporting Russia. And I think there's been some umbrage taken and that
*06:21.700- 06:27.020* :  is ratcheted up, the sort of rhetoric that we're hearing. But what Mr. Morovietsky, the Prime Minister,
*06:27.020- 06:33.740* :  actually said, was Poland is no longer transferring any military weapons to Ukraine.
*06:33.980- 06:41.580* :  And that is true because Poland has already sent 320 of its Soviet era tanks to Ukraine.
*06:41.580- 06:48.960* :  It's already sent 14 megphighted jets. It doesn't have any more of those weapons in its stockpiles
*06:48.960- 06:56.300* :  to send to Ukraine. And it is currently replacing about one third of its military capability that
*06:56.300- 07:02.160* :  it's given to Ukraine. It's now replacing that with modern Western made tanks and fighter jets.
*07:02.160- 07:07.700* :  And that's what Mr. Morovietsky was referring to. I don't see this as a change in government
*07:07.700- 07:14.560* :  position in terms of helping to arm Ukraine. In fact, there's a Polish arms manufacturer,
*07:14.560- 07:22.380* :  which right now is fulfilling a contract to supply about 60 crab howitzers to Ukraine, which
*07:22.380- 07:27.860* :  will be sent to Ukraine in the coming months and over the next year. So there will be Polish
*07:28.140- 07:32.980* :  military arms going to Ukraine, but this is a private deal. It's done not from the government
*07:32.980- 07:37.640* :  in terms of donation. Ukraine is paying for those howitzers. Just want to clarify this. Now,
*07:37.860- 07:42.920* :  this statement has obviously caused a lot of alarm. Poland is basically saying it's not sending
*07:42.920- 07:46.840* :  any more of its own weapons because it needs to restock its own supplies. But it's also a major
*07:46.840- 07:52.700* :  supply route for weapons that come from other allies like the U.S. and Britain. Those weapons are
*07:52.700- 07:58.500* :  going to continue arriving in Ukraine. Is that correct? That is correct. Yes. And Mr. Morovietsky said
*07:58.500- 08:03.700* :  that this is important. There's an international hub for humanitarian and military aid in
*08:03.700- 08:08.300* :  Jeshoff, in South East and Poland, near to the Ukrainian border. And he said that will continue.
*08:08.920- 08:15.300* :  We're not talking about an embargo of weapons transferring from Poland to Ukraine. That is not
*08:15.300- 08:20.960* :  the case. Adam Easton, as we've been hearing, Poland's decision to ban Ukrainian grain imports
*08:20.960- 08:25.620* :  has angered Kyiv. With more, here's our Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse.
*08:26.220- 08:30.620* :  Well, what we're hearing from different commentators, different news channels is,
*08:30.620- 08:37.580* :  is this really a fight Ukraine wants to pick? Because I think what we are seeing is an almost
*08:37.580- 08:44.600* :  stubborn stance from the Zelensky administration. But we are talking about one of Ukraine's most loyal
*08:44.600- 08:50.180* :  allies in a country where if you are close to the border in Western Ukraine in near Levyv, for
*08:50.200- 08:56.060* :  example, there is an endless flow of Western weaponry humanitarian aid that comes in under
*08:56.060- 09:02.840* :  police escort through lorries. There's a military base across the border where typically U.S. aircraft
*09:02.840- 09:10.040* :  land to drop their Western weaponry. And the idea politically that now Ukraine is sort of doubling
*09:10.220- 09:15.500* :  down on its condemnation of this grain ban is hard to fathom it seems in political circles here.
*09:15.900- 09:20.220* :  What Ukraine is desperate to do is to get its grain out because its economy has suffered
*09:20.220- 09:26.300* :  enough already. It needs to get its main produce out of the country. So there are issues around
*09:26.300- 09:32.040* :  regulation where this grain ends up. But I think you have both sides here thinking, well this isn't
*09:32.080- 09:36.140* :  our fault. So you wonder what is happening to the grain in the interim where it is transported,
*09:36.140- 09:42.440* :  where it is stored. And I think unless there is any kind of reform in that specific part of the
*09:42.440- 09:50.120* :  supply chain, it's hard to see which side will be satisfied. James Waterhouse. Meanwhile, as the war
*09:50.120- 09:56.460* :  in Ukraine grinds on, the number of amputees coming back from the battlefields is soaring. 15,000
*09:56.460- 10:01.720* :  men and women have lost limbs in the first half of this year alone, according to official figures
*10:01.720- 10:06.680* :  released by Ukraine's Ministry of Health. The government won't reveal how many are soldiers,
*10:06.680- 10:12.980* :  but the vast majority aren't likely to be military. That means Ukraine has seen more amputees
*10:12.980- 10:19.520* :  in six months than Britain did in all six years of the Second World War. Our senior international
*10:19.520- 10:27.440* :  correspondent Ola Gehrin met one amputee and his wife in Kiev. I'm sitting with Andrei Smolensky
*10:27.440- 10:35.820* :  and his wife Alina. They're both 27 years old. And Andrei, like very many young Ukrainians,
*10:36.500- 10:42.480* :  went to fight when Russia's full-scale invasion happened. And he has come back from the war,
*10:42.860- 10:50.720* :  and he has lost both of his arms. He has lost his sight and the hearing in one ear.
*10:51.840- 10:56.740* :  Andrei, could I ask you just to tell me what happened that day, the day you were injured?
*10:57.420- 11:05.440* :  I was the commander of Smol reconnaissance unit that is responsible for UAV's drones.
*11:06.280- 11:13.100* :  Our mission was to come early in the morning and do our job. And then I remember how I
*11:13.580- 11:21.140* :  started quieting out of the trench. And the next memory is I just waken up in the hospital.
*11:21.900- 11:27.660* :  Everything was so dark, I thought, oh, what a dark night. And what a weird dream.
*11:28.580- 11:37.760* :  But then slowly I started realizing that I can't move with my hands. And that something is on
*11:38.380- 11:44.240* :  my eyes, like something covering my eyes. That moment I realized that maybe something bad happened
*11:44.240- 11:50.040* :  actually. Alina, what was your feeling when you managed to see him and to reach the bedside?
*11:50.720- 11:57.700* :  Of course, it was very difficult, but the only thing that I thought about, it was I want to
*11:57.900- 12:06.060* :  be with him. I just want to be with him. I just want to touch him. I just want to say that he is not
*12:06.060- 12:16.800* :  alone. I saw that Andrei really didn't have his hands. So I just touched his leg and started to
*12:16.800- 12:27.820* :  talk with him. I said that we are family, we are together. Don't worry, I am with you.
*12:28.820- 12:36.520* :  And everything will be okay. Tell me what future do you see now for you and Alina?
*12:39.120- 12:47.220* :  I am feeling like I'm still fighting because the war is not ended. It's my new mission
*12:47.860- 12:55.700* :  to help other veterans that would come after me. We had never had such a big amount of
*12:55.700- 13:05.320* :  amputees, people that again blinded because of war. And that's crazy. Our medical system is not
*13:05.320- 13:13.700* :  ready for that. So it felt like this is a new challenge for our country. What has been the hardest
*13:13.700- 13:20.420* :  part of what you've gone through? What's the hardest thing to deal with? I would say the hardest
*13:20.420- 13:30.580* :  thing to deal with for me was I didn't achieve my goal. I wanted to win this war and I don't feel like I'm
*13:30.660- 13:37.700* :  finished what I started. Former Ukrainian soldier Andrei and his wife Alina speaking there to
*13:37.700- 13:44.340* :  Ola Gehrin. India has halted visa services in Canada and called for a reduction in Canadian
*13:44.340- 13:50.160* :  diplomatic staff in India amid a deepening row between the two countries. A spokesman for the
*13:50.160- 13:55.680* :  Indian Foreign Affairs Ministry, Aaron Dambakchi, said the visa suspension was because of threats
*13:55.680- 14:00.620* :  to staff. The question is not about travel to India. Those who have valid visas, those who have
*14:00.620- 14:05.800* :  other kind of documents like OCI, are subject to travel to India. But the issue is of incitement
*14:05.800- 14:10.600* :  of violence, the inaction by Canadian authorities and a creation of an environment that disrupts
*14:10.600- 14:15.060* :  the functioning of our high commission and consulate. That's what making us stop temporarily
*14:15.500- 14:21.940* :  off visa or providing visa servitude. Relations deteriorated sharply this week when the Canadian
*14:21.940- 14:27.500* :  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Indian agents may have been involved in the murder of a Canadian
*14:27.500- 14:34.120* :  Sikh activist. Archana Shukla in Mumbai has more details. An online visa application center has
*14:34.120- 14:39.240* :  said the Indian Mission in Canada suspended visa services for Canadians until further notice
*14:39.240- 14:44.380* :  citing operational reasons. India's foreign ministry has not responded to queries about the
*14:44.620- 14:50.580* :  matter. This comes a day after India advised its citizens in Canada to exercise at most caution.
*14:51.240- 14:56.060* :  Tensions flared this week when Canada said Indian agents may have been involved in the
*14:56.060- 15:01.700* :  killing of a Canadian Sikh separatist leader in June near Vancouver. India has strongly denied
*15:01.700- 15:07.680* :  allegations calling it absurd. Both countries have expelled a diplomat each likely over the case.
*15:16.480- 15:23.100* :  Mexican train services bound for the US are suspended as thousands risk life and limb to reach the border.
*15:29.300- 15:34.680* :  I had just come out of one of my bare knuckle boxing matches. I don't know why but the first
*15:34.680- 15:40.460* :  thing that came to my brain was what if I do a drag show. Remarkable personal stories told by
*15:40.460- 15:45.120* :  the people that lived them. I could easily have pulled that trigger but that was not my brief.
*15:45.520- 15:50.340* :  I was not an assassin. I was not told to do that. I was not told to murder him.

*15:59.520- 16:05.480* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Police in China are warning people to beware of false
*16:05.480- 16:11.760* :  propaganda after they detained more than 50 people including 11 internet celebrities who are accused
*16:11.760- 16:16.980* :  of raking in money through deceptive live streaming. The companies running these scams
*16:17.140- 16:22.320* :  were also accused of employing people to promote counterfeit agricultural products during the
*16:22.320- 16:27.460* :  broadcast. Our China media analyst Kerry Allen told us more about the scams.
*16:27.960- 16:32.200* :  Well these live streamers had millions of followers and many of them operated out of
*16:32.560- 16:38.020* :  southwestern China, a province known as Sichuan. And largely what connected them was that they
*16:38.020- 16:43.820* :  allegedly relied on fabricating tragic experiences. So they spoke about impoverished backgrounds
*16:43.820- 16:48.400* :  in the hope of getting sympathy. And then what happened was that they allegedly promoted
*16:48.400- 16:55.160* :  counterfeit goods, mainly honey local products they said and they hired people online to post comments
*16:55.160- 17:01.300* :  to boost their engagement. So generally this was a large operation involving a lot of people
*17:01.300- 17:07.840* :  promoting fake traffic. So the police report says and people who didn't claim to be who they
*17:07.840- 17:14.240* :  said they were posting online. So one user for example she'd racked up 3 million fans and
*17:14.360- 17:20.400* :  questions started to be raised about her after she was seen wearing expensive clothing and visiting
*17:20.400- 17:24.940* :  high end places. Whereas previously a lot of her content had shown her in the countryside around
*17:24.940- 17:30.580* :  farms. So there were questions about the authenticity of who she was. And how big is the live streaming
*17:30.580- 17:35.980* :  e-commerce market in China? It is absolutely huge. I mean we factor in that China has a
*17:35.980- 17:42.000* :  population of 1.4 billion people anyway. The latest statistics are that users of live streaming e-commerce
*17:42.000- 17:49.340* :  platforms in China that there are over 400 million of them, 469 million by the end of June 2022.
*17:50.200- 17:56.720* :  And they sell tens of millions of pieces of goods online and it's a very popular profession for
*17:56.720- 18:02.060* :  young people nowadays. I've seen a recent poll suggesting that more than 60% of Chinese youngsters
*18:02.060- 18:07.380* :  want to become internet influencers or live streaming hosts. Yeah as you say growing industry and
*18:07.380- 18:12.580* :  it's getting harder and harder to tell what's real from what's fake anymore. What are people calling
*18:12.580- 18:16.780* :  for? What do they want to see done? Yeah there's a lot of concern about this because obviously with
*18:16.780- 18:22.960* :  the rise of artificial intelligence and facial recognition technologies you can add filters nowadays
*18:22.960- 18:28.860* :  that can change the way someone's face looks and this changes perceptions about whether someone is
*18:28.860- 18:34.680* :  who they really say they are. And there are concerns because yes it's a huge lucrative industry
*18:34.680- 18:39.120* :  where people can make a lot of money out of deception. So there have been calls for increased
*18:39.500- 18:44.020* :  regulation in the country. I mean there are already lengthy terms and conditions about what people
*18:44.020- 18:48.480* :  can and can't live stream in China anyway. But particularly in the last months there have been
*18:48.480- 18:55.860* :  calls to enhance laws around facial recognition to make it and to make sure that companies aren't
*18:55.860- 19:03.140* :  using it or you know without without due course or reason. Kerry Allen. Now to Mexico we're footage
*19:13.300- 19:16.740* :  emerged this week of an alarming site. Hundreds of people crammed on top of a moving freight train
*19:16.800- 19:22.340* :  on route to the U.S. border. Many of them standing. There's been a big rise in the number of
*19:22.340- 19:28.060* :  migrants trying to hitch similar rides and getting killed or injured in the process. As a result
*19:28.060- 19:33.200* :  Mexico's biggest rail operator has announced it's suspending some of its services in the north of
*19:33.200- 19:39.700* :  the country. So just how bad is the situation? Louise Fajardo is following this story from Miami.
*19:40.240- 19:45.760* :  This is a situation that has been going on for quite some time. There are reports of hundreds of
*19:45.760- 19:51.180* :  thousands of people using the trains that cross the border from Mexico into the U.S.
*19:51.180- 19:57.000* :  This train system has a terrible reputation among the people who are trying to reach the U.S.
*19:57.000- 20:02.100* :  and people refer to it as the beast. These trains that cause a lot of injuries and accidents
*20:02.100- 20:07.960* :  for people trying to cross without documents. They try to jump on the train sometimes even when
*20:07.960- 20:13.820* :  the trains are moving. They obviously have to try to avoid the controls by Mexican security forces
*20:14.140- 20:19.700* :  and by the train companies themselves. So that very often makes them engage in dangerous practices
*20:20.120- 20:24.840* :  and the other thing is that they are being targeted by criminal gangs that prey on these vulnerable
*20:24.840- 20:30.280* :  migrants trying to reach the U.S. without documents. They come from all across Latin America and all
*20:30.280- 20:35.040* :  across the world. Many of them will have traveled great distances by foot across Central America.
*20:35.520- 20:40.600* :  Just to give you an idea of the figures this Monday the U.S. Border Patrol said that on a single
*20:40.600- 20:46.920* :  day they had apprehended nearly 8,000 people trying to cross the border. Also very large numbers
*20:46.920- 20:52.140* :  of children. One estimate says that there is more than 80,000 children who have crossed this year
*20:52.140- 20:58.320* :  in the first seven months of the year. So again record numbers, clearly a very serious humanitarian
*20:58.320- 21:03.480* :  situation and a situation that's going to have political impacts in the U.S. as the electoral season
*21:03.480- 21:09.920* :  gets near. Luis Fajardo. It's 10 years since Al Shabaab government stormed the Westgate Shopping
*21:09.920- 21:16.600* :  Centre in the Kenyan Capital Nairobi. Over the course of four days, 67 people were killed and more
*21:16.600- 21:23.420* :  than 200 wounded. One of those who died was a celebrated Ghanaian poet and diplomat, coffee Awu Noor,
*21:23.540- 21:29.620* :  who was in the Kenyan Capital to speak at a book fair. Awu Noor's son, Afetsi, survived the attack.
*21:29.620- 21:35.960* :  He spoke to my colleague Alan Kursouja about how he lost his father by being in their wrong place
*21:36.440- 21:42.860* :  at the wrong time. On that morning, at breakfast, he kept complaining that he was tired of the food,
*21:43.140- 21:49.120* :  the East African food, because he likes a lot of pepper and spice. So he wanted something spicy to eat
*21:49.260- 21:54.420* :  for lunch. He suggested we find an Indian restaurant, at least he figured out where the closest
*21:54.420- 22:00.600* :  day to the kind of pepper we eat here in Ghana. Instead of going somewhere we hadn't been yet
*22:01.180- 22:05.860* :  by ourselves and getting lost and not him being late. Let's just go to the mall because
*22:06.700- 22:12.060* :  it's right next to the hotel and we've been there before so it was fine. We asked the hotel to get
*22:12.060- 22:17.460* :  us a car they did and then we left so we're just going for lunch, quick lunch. Literally as we
*22:17.460- 22:23.240* :  arrived I got out of the vehicle, I opened the door for him as I stood there waiting for him to
*22:23.240- 22:28.880* :  step out of the vehicle, the blast went off, followed by the shots. So I turned and started running
*22:28.880- 22:35.420* :  into the mall. We didn't realize that the mall was the target. So I dashed into the mall and
*22:35.740- 22:41.720* :  lower now I realized that he followed me because when I turned to run into the mall I sort of
*22:41.720- 22:46.320* :  tried to slam the door shut so he would stay like sort of hide in the car because I figured it
*22:46.320- 22:51.180* :  was passing by, it was then coming to the mall. As I was running into the mall, I could hear the
*22:51.180- 22:57.260* :  bullets zipped past me, some zipped past my ear and just before I got to the top of the stairs,
*22:57.480- 23:03.340* :  I got hit in the back so that I fell to the ground and the glass shotted in front of me and I
*23:03.340- 23:09.660* :  crawled the rest of my way into the mall and then I turned right into the first shop which was the
*23:09.660- 23:14.980* :  tapas restaurant that people people still seated on their tables, you know, having enjoying their
*23:14.980- 23:19.180* :  mail and drink and they were looking at me on the floor like what the hell is going on then we
*23:19.180- 23:24.820* :  like get down, you know, then everybody realized oh okay we went into the back of the restaurant
*23:24.820- 23:28.400* :  which was the kitchen and so you're bleeding, you're crawling on the floor, you're going to the
*23:28.400- 23:34.840* :  kitchen. They had now advanced into the mall, I could see two of the attackers standing at the
*23:34.840- 23:40.800* :  entrance, they were back to back, one was facing into the mall, firing, the other one was now facing
*23:40.800- 23:45.260* :  towards the car park, was so fired in that direction. Now I don't pray, I didn't see my dad behind
*23:45.260- 23:52.780* :  so I realized he was still either outside or in the car or outside. Then one of them turned my
*23:52.780- 23:58.060* :  direction and saw me standing there staring at them and then he said something to the other guy,
*23:58.060- 24:04.620* :  they sort of laughed a little bit, he pointed his rifle towards my direction and started walking
*24:04.620- 24:11.380* :  into the restaurant. So I ducked and then I went under the sink, he fired a few shots, then it
*24:11.380- 24:16.680* :  was silent for a couple of seconds then I had a blast, the other way for a few seconds are sort of
*24:16.700- 24:21.040* :  fruits, you know, because I thought that was it, he's just coming to finish everybody but
*24:22.280- 24:27.060* :  they are, I just heard the shots and it was moving further away, so I figured okay, he probably
*24:27.060- 24:29.520* :  threw it, we needed something and just left.
*24:30.480- 24:35.600* :  Events see, I was not talking about the attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Kenya 10 years ago.
*24:36.820- 24:41.340* :  The French are famous for overthrowing their monarchy centuries ago but that hasn't stopped them
*24:41.400- 24:48.060* :  from giving a very warm welcome to Britain's King Charles. After a lavish state banquet at Versailles
*24:48.060- 24:53.460* :  on Wednesday evening, today the King addressed French lawmakers in the Senate in French,
*24:53.460- 24:55.280* :  Yusko Field was watching.
*24:58.940- 25:03.100* :  This was the first time in history, a British monarch has addressed members of the two
*25:03.100- 25:07.980* :  houses of the French parliament assembled in the Senate chamber. Speaking in a combination of
*25:07.980- 25:12.700* :  French and English, the King used the occasion to plead for a renewal of the alliance between
*25:12.700- 25:17.180* :  the two countries, which he said was more important than ever in view of the threat to European
*25:17.180- 25:22.000* :  security in Ukraine and because of what he called the most existential challenge of all,
*25:22.240- 25:25.580* :  that of global warming and the catastrophic destruction of nature.
*25:25.580- 25:30.880* :  Let us renew the ontant Coriel, he said, and make it an ontant for sustainability.
*25:30.880- 25:35.440* :  There was a lengthy standing evasion from the parliamentarians when the King concluded.
*25:36.100- 25:42.160* :  Yusko Field. And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global
