00:17.860 - 00:18.880:  It's a real melting pot.
00:18.880 - 00:20.860:  Yeah, the surface has lost happening.

00:28.480 - 00:31.800:  This is the Global News Podcasts from the BBC World Service.
00:34.220 - 00:39.080:  I'm Garasparlo and at 1300 GMT on Thursday the 14th of September,
00:39.360 - 00:40.600:  these are our main stories.
00:41.300 - 00:44.940:  Thousands of people are feared dead after catastrophic floods in Libya.
00:45.460 - 00:47.580:  Now the UN says it's sending an aid.
00:48.120 - 00:52.540:  Tremors are still being felt in Morocco days after a massive deadly quake
00:52.860 - 00:54.900:  that are hampering search and rescue efforts.
00:55.520 - 00:58.600:  And in the case of alleged sexual harassment caught on camera,
00:58.980 - 01:00.420:  shocks Spanish society.
01:02.700 - 01:07.360:  Also in this podcast, we look at the most unlikely of royal weddings and...
01:07.480 - 01:08.740:  We need to see pain in the economy.
01:08.740 - 01:11.600:  We need to remind people that they work for the employer,
01:11.960 - 01:12.960:  not the other way around.
01:13.300 - 01:14.720:  It's a dynamic that has to change.
01:14.720 - 01:18.640:  We've got to kill that attitude and that has to come through hurting the economy.
01:19.220 - 01:23.900:  Here why one multi-millionaire is now rowing back on his comments about workers.
01:26.780 - 01:30.120:  Four days on from the cataclysmic floods in eastern Libya
01:30.120 - 01:33.800:  and the number of people feared to have died is in the thousands.
01:33.800 - 01:35.940:  Many bodies have still not been found.
01:35.940 - 01:38.700:  The worst affected area is the Port City of Dernar,
01:39.160 - 01:41.380:  which was home to around 90,000 people,
01:41.900 - 01:46.300:  following the storm to dams burst sweeping whole communities into the sea.
01:46.760 - 01:49.820:  The BBC's German would has this report on how the people of Dernar
01:49.820 - 01:52.660:  are trying to come to terms with the scale of the disaster.
01:55.320 - 01:58.240:  Climbing over the rubble that used to be the city of Dernar,
01:58.680 - 02:00.900:  a red crescent worker prepares a body bag.
02:04.700 - 02:07.580:  Racked in a blanket, four men carry a tiny body,
02:08.360 - 02:11.260:  one of the many thousands of victims of this disaster.
02:12.620 - 02:14.560:  For the boy's father, it is too much.
02:19.000 - 02:19.920:  Don't give me patience.
02:20.440 - 02:21.420:  My heart is with you.
02:21.900 - 02:22.980:  The man says to his son.
02:29.120 - 02:32.580:  The scale of what happened in Libya last Sunday is hard to comprehend.
02:33.720 - 02:37.360:  You can hear the fear in their voices and the power of the water.
02:37.360 - 02:38.660:  The power of the water.
02:41.040 - 02:42.780:  Shortly after this video was taken,
02:43.360 - 02:45.980:  thousands of people were simply washed into the Mediterranean.
02:47.380 - 02:48.960:  They're up, we're up, we're up.
02:49.420 - 02:51.520:  No picture, no film, get ever,
02:52.640 - 02:54.620:  destroy what we've seen.
02:55.240 - 02:58.360:  Salad drove from the city of Benghazi to find his relatives
02:59.060 - 03:02.220:  only to discover 150 of them had died.
03:02.940 - 03:05.580:  Hundreds of bodies laid on the street,
03:05.580 - 03:08.900:  on the what is used to be streets.
03:10.020 - 03:13.180:  The whole buildings were out there,
03:13.180 - 03:16.660:  it's not there, as if it's never been there, never.
03:17.620 - 03:21.960:  115, one family, all of them wiped out.
03:22.800 - 03:30.480:  Grandparents, grandmothers, wives, kids, all of them,
03:30.580 - 03:32.200:  they were thrown into the sea.
03:34.240 - 03:36.520:  The initial shock is now turning to anger.
03:37.340 - 03:38.900:  This was a natural disaster,
03:39.400 - 03:41.360:  but enabled by the failings of government
03:42.160 - 03:44.600:  and of the dams that should have held the water back.
03:45.900 - 03:47.880:  Abu Al-Mantasa lived in the city.
03:49.860 - 03:51.800:  We had warned the authorities since last week.
03:52.180 - 03:55.560:  No, for years, that the dam had cracks and needs to be maintained.
03:55.560 - 03:57.940:  We said it, and nobody listened to us,
03:58.240 - 03:59.700:  and now the whole of Dürner is flooded.
04:03.440 - 04:07.140:  All the while, an increasingly fallon rescue operation, continues.
04:10.960 - 04:12.920:  As the firemen cut their way into a garage,
04:13.420 - 04:15.840:  a medic waits outside with an orange stretcher.
04:18.180 - 04:20.480:  Whoever took shelter inside did not survive,
04:21.220 - 04:23.320:  like the little boy, like so many others,
04:23.980 - 04:26.000:  they too leave a black body bag.
04:29.600 - 04:32.280:  This is partly a story about the force of nature,
04:33.220 - 04:36.220:  but it's also one about the failings of government
04:37.060 - 04:39.600:  and the terrible consequences when the two collide.
04:43.460 - 04:45.360:  Well, you heard there in Joem was report
04:45.360 - 04:47.620:  the anger towards local authorities
04:47.620 - 04:51.060:  for not heeding warnings about the instability of the dams,
04:51.160 - 04:53.580:  many see this as a symptom of the country's split
04:53.580 - 04:55.780:  between two rival administrations,
04:56.400 - 04:58.460:  one based in the capital, Tripoli in the West,
04:58.840 - 05:00.460:  and the other in Tobruk in the East.
05:00.620 - 05:03.340:  And in between them, rival militias that compete the influence.
05:04.000 - 05:04.960:  In response to the floods,
05:04.960 - 05:07.480:  the United Nations has said it's sending all the aid
05:07.480 - 05:09.640:  and teams to the region it possibly can,
05:10.380 - 05:13.500:  but are the rival factions cooperating in the relief effort?
05:13.960 - 05:15.340:  Are correspondingly in a synchap,
05:15.340 - 05:17.640:  is monitoring the situation from Beirut?
05:18.140 - 05:20.660:  So far, we've heard announcement from both sides
05:20.660 - 05:22.640:  that this is a national catastrophe.
05:22.640 - 05:25.620:  It's a national disaster that they have to attend to.
05:26.100 - 05:28.600:  We've heard reports of them coordinating efforts
05:28.600 - 05:29.800:  and talking to each other
05:30.220 - 05:33.460:  and both of them calling for international aid to arrive.
05:33.460 - 05:35.560:  This is the time to set differences aside
05:36.160 - 05:38.260:  and act for the sake of the nation.
05:38.560 - 05:40.360:  This is the country that is oil rich,
05:40.360 - 05:44.180:  but poor with administration, poor with power.
05:44.180 - 05:45.800:  These two governments are delivering
05:45.800 - 05:47.700:  for their own nationals.
05:47.700 - 05:50.480:  Now, the situation in Eastern Libya,
05:50.480 - 05:53.900:  especially in Derna, is beyond catastrophic.
05:53.980 - 05:57.800:  The need for efforts for rescue is immense
05:57.800 - 05:59.900:  and it will take weeks and probably months
05:59.900 - 06:02.440:  before this city goes back on its feet.
06:02.820 - 06:05.840:  But the priority now is to retrieve and recover bodies.
06:06.400 - 06:08.060:  There are fears of disease spreading
06:08.060 - 06:11.000:  because of the corpses covered with rubble,
06:11.000 - 06:14.980:  but there are also concerns of efforts of finding these bodies.
06:14.980 - 06:17.040:  We've heard reports of people losing
06:17.860 - 06:20.500:  entire families and the number of the dead
06:20.500 - 06:23.700:  is only going to be higher as the hours
06:23.700 - 06:26.820:  and the days unfold the rescue operation.
06:27.220 - 06:29.460:  Lena Sinjab, the flooding in Libya
06:29.720 - 06:32.200:  isn't the only natural disaster North Africa
06:32.200 - 06:33.900:  is having to cope with this week.
06:34.340 - 06:37.500:  Almost 3,000 people died in the earthquake in Morocco
06:37.500 - 06:39.160:  and many have been left homeless.
06:39.720 - 06:42.180:  Small equates are still being felt in the Atlas mountains
06:42.180 - 06:44.580:  where there's little hope of finding survivors.
06:45.220 - 06:46.880:  The BBC's James Coppano is there
06:46.940 - 06:49.180:  and sent this report from the town of Amsmeez.
06:54.220 - 06:55.800:  A clatter of a busy kitchen
06:56.300 - 06:57.520:  lunches well on the way,
06:58.080 - 07:01.220:  but most of the people eating here at the Olivary Hotel
07:01.560 - 07:02.800:  are not paying guests.
07:03.400 - 07:05.740:  Instead, they lost their homes in the earthquake.
07:06.540 - 07:09.020:  Saladin, whose family owns the hotel,
07:09.520 - 07:12.480:  has opened up its doors to everyone who needs it.
07:14.260 - 07:15.340:  We stop all activities
07:15.340 - 07:17.320:  and we open our doors to everyone.
07:17.320 - 07:18.640:  Everyone is welcome to here.
07:19.320 - 07:22.400:  Everyone who have no place to stay here is his house.
07:22.760 - 07:23.940:  What needs to happen next?
07:24.260 - 07:26.000:  Just tell us, explain to us what needs to be done
07:26.000 - 07:27.900:  to get this place back to normal.
07:28.340 - 07:30.260:  Rebuild the houses. Rebuild the town.
07:30.380 - 07:31.720:  Because right now they have tents
07:31.760 - 07:33.360:  but the aren't places that aren't safe.
07:33.560 - 07:35.400:  People here can't leave the land
07:35.400 - 07:37.760:  because people here are really attached to their land.
07:40.260 - 07:42.900:  A walk round, one of Amsmeez's oldest neighborhoods,
07:43.180 - 07:45.520:  gives an idea of the scale of the problem.
07:45.580 - 07:48.640:  There's a heavily damaged pink mosque to my left,
07:48.640 - 07:50.700:  a school with no roof,
07:51.180 - 07:53.480:  a shop with its entrails open to the world,
07:53.480 - 07:56.400:  a shoe hanging up rather for lawnleaf from a shelf.
07:57.280 - 08:01.000:  There are possessions, beds and fridges out in the open.
08:01.000 - 08:02.680:  Homes have been destroyed.
08:03.440 - 08:06.220:  So just how easy is it going to be to rebuild this town?
08:07.720 - 08:09.200:  What are you thinking?
08:12.400 - 08:15.520:  Back at the hotel they're asking themselves just that question.
08:16.200 - 08:19.840:  Shai Ma, a university student used to live in a nice home nearby.
08:20.780 - 08:23.300:  Now she's homeless and wondering about her future.
08:24.540 - 08:25.860:  So what's going to happen now for you?
08:25.860 - 08:26.200:  Do you think?
08:26.980 - 08:29.260:  We don't know, we're going to sit on the street
08:30.220 - 08:31.700:  and tell her to figure out what she's going to go.
08:32.220 - 08:35.160:  Because even if we go to Marackech, it's still risky
08:35.720 - 08:36.980:  because the Earth are still moving.
08:37.580 - 08:38.980:  It's not safe.
08:39.100 - 08:42.760:  Are you confident that the government is going to be able to help you?
08:43.880 - 08:44.740:  I don't know.
08:44.880 - 08:49.060:  I think it's hard for them because there is a lot of cities.
08:49.520 - 08:51.900:  Maybe governments can help, maybe not.
08:52.860 - 08:54.400:  I don't have trust in them, really.
08:54.400 - 08:55.340:  I don't trust them.
08:55.620 - 08:58.520:  I trust people in Morocco, other people in Morocco.
08:59.180 - 09:00.760:  I hope you can help us because
09:01.320 - 09:03.720:  if the government can't do anything in these cases,
09:04.260 - 09:04.980:  it's a disaster.
09:09.940 - 09:12.320:  A couple of kids kick a ball around on the lawn.
09:12.940 - 09:13.880:  They should be in school.
09:14.660 - 09:17.200:  It's not hard to worry about what comes next for them.
09:18.660 - 09:21.540:  If I were with as a child, I would be very happy
09:21.580 - 09:24.080:  because I would not be obliged to wake up early
09:24.080 - 09:26.140:  to have homework to go to school.
09:26.640 - 09:29.940:  This is Abdel Ali Mafodi, a secondary school teacher.
09:30.820 - 09:33.760:  If I view it from another perspective of a parent
09:33.760 - 09:37.300:  and a teacher, this is going to be a great, great loss
09:37.340 - 09:39.220:  for our future generations.
09:39.940 - 09:41.460:  When you look at all these challenges,
09:41.960 - 09:43.820:  what's the one that worries you the most?
09:44.360 - 09:46.820:  You know, you can die of cold in few hours.
09:47.840 - 09:49.780:  And we are about to welcome wintertime,
09:50.340 - 09:52.720:  where temperatures are below zero in the village
09:53.320 - 09:55.060:  and the mountains are covered with snow.
09:55.720 - 09:58.640:  So how can you imagine the situation of all people
09:58.640 - 10:01.700:  that are now homeless, that are now sitting
10:01.700 - 10:04.980:  under tunts, how could they manage that cold?
10:05.700 - 10:07.480:  If their houses are not built again,
10:08.100 - 10:10.140:  we can stand hunger, we can stand first,
10:10.500 - 10:11.720:  but we can't stand cold.
10:12.120 - 10:13.400:  From Morocco's Atlas Mountains,
10:13.400 - 10:15.280:  that report by James Coppano.
10:16.160 - 10:18.820:  Many women in Spain were hoping that men would start
10:18.820 - 10:20.300:  to show them more respect.
10:20.300 - 10:22.660:  After Luis Ribeales was forced to resign
10:22.660 - 10:25.020:  as president of the country's football association,
10:25.600 - 10:26.820:  there was a national outcry,
10:26.820 - 10:28.840:  when he cased the World Cup winning play,
10:28.840 - 10:30.300:  Jenny Amoso on the lips.
10:30.840 - 10:32.960:  But sexual harassment is in the headlines again.
10:33.180 - 10:35.440:  After a man in the street appeared to grope
10:35.440 - 10:38.400:  the bank side of a television reporter live on air.
10:38.440 - 10:40.100:  He reaches behind Isabel Ado
10:40.100 - 10:42.400:  as she speaks to the presenter in the studio.
10:42.720 - 10:44.200:  I have my father, El Hombre,
10:44.440 - 10:46.180:  I tried to get him out of here.
10:46.480 - 10:48.060:  One second, let's go to my office.
10:48.580 - 10:50.340:  Sorry, El Hombre tried to get in,
10:51.440 - 10:54.140:  but he was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault.
10:54.140 - 10:56.380:  Guy Hedgeko is our correspondent, Imadred.
10:56.740 - 10:59.320:  This clip has gone viral on social media
10:59.900 - 11:01.660:  under the hashtag, Seacabor.
11:01.660 - 11:05.600:  That's the slogan that emerged from the affair
11:05.600 - 11:09.060:  surrounding Luis Ribeales after he kissed Jenny Amoso
11:09.060 - 11:11.420:  on the mouth after the World Cup final.
11:12.080 - 11:16.520:  And that was seen as a slogan against sexism in general,
11:16.520 - 11:17.340:  across Spain.
11:17.420 - 11:19.360:  But there's also been a reaction to this
11:19.720 - 11:20.740:  from the very highest level.
11:20.740 - 11:23.540:  Yolanda Diaz, who is one of the deputy prime ministers,
11:24.180 - 11:25.560:  she spoke out about this.
11:25.560 - 11:27.500:  And she said sexism makes journalists
11:27.500 - 11:29.580:  suffer sexual assaults like this.
11:30.160 - 11:33.760:  Her colleague, Irene Montero, who is minister of equality,
11:34.340 - 11:35.420:  also talked about it.
11:35.420 - 11:38.320:  She said this was a non-consensual physical contact.
11:38.780 - 11:40.720:  Therefore, it was sexual violence.
11:41.400 - 11:43.260:  So people are talking about it,
11:43.260 - 11:46.480:  whether it's in the government or online as well.
11:46.800 - 11:49.620:  I'm just watching the clip as we're talking here, Guy.
11:49.620 - 11:52.780:  You can see that the reporter remains fairly calm
11:52.780 - 11:55.760:  before he walks away trying to scrunch her hair again.
11:55.760 - 11:57.520:  And she's been praised for remaining calm.
11:57.520 - 12:00.300:  But many are saying that every day sexism in Spain
12:00.300 - 12:03.380:  and playing down these kind of incidents has to end.
12:03.540 - 12:05.580:  Well, yes, I mean, that's part of this debate
12:05.580 - 12:08.180:  that has sort of been going on, certainly
12:08.180 - 12:11.820:  since the Luis Ribeales case, but really before that as well.
12:11.820 - 12:14.860:  And issues of consent, sexual consent,
12:14.860 - 12:19.140:  and sexual equality have been very much in the public domain
12:19.140 - 12:20.920:  over the last few years in particular.
12:21.300 - 12:22.820:  And that's partly because this government
12:22.820 - 12:25.360:  has focused a lot on that in terms of legislation.
12:26.020 - 12:27.560:  But there is a feeling that there's still
12:28.080 - 12:29.680:  a lot of resistance to that.
12:29.680 - 12:31.900:  The police, for example, are concerned about
12:32.440 - 12:34.660:  a rise in sexual assaults on women
12:34.660 - 12:37.340:  among young people over recent years.
12:37.800 - 12:39.680:  And then on a sort of everyday level
12:39.680 - 12:43.000:  when it comes to offices or just day-to-day life,
12:43.560 - 12:46.140:  a lot of women say they still suffer sexism.
12:46.160 - 12:47.580:  They say there are too many people
12:48.120 - 12:50.420:  behaving in this way who go unpunished.
12:50.940 - 12:52.200:  The BBC's Guy Hedgeko.
12:52.960 - 12:54.820:  The BBC's learnt that in the last year,
12:54.820 - 12:57.720:  a Russian fighter pilot attempted to shoot down
12:57.720 - 12:59.480:  a British surveillance aircraft
13:00.000 - 13:02.120:  that was carrying dozens of military personnel.
13:02.680 - 13:04.260:  Russia blamed the incident which occurred
13:04.260 - 13:06.560:  over the Black Sea on a technical malfunction.
13:07.440 - 13:10.140:  The UK's Ministry of Defence accepted that explanation,
13:10.200 - 13:12.600:  but as our correspondent Jonathan Bill reports,
13:13.140 - 13:14.680:  the M.O.D. knew much more.
13:15.040 - 13:17.160:  The RAF plane was on a surveillance mission
13:17.160 - 13:19.820:  over the Black Sea with a crew of up to 30.
13:20.580 - 13:22.700:  It was able to intercept communications
13:23.440 - 13:26.240:  and hear the actions of a rogue Russian pilot
13:26.260 - 13:28.120:  that could have led to their deaths.
13:28.960 - 13:31.540:  An ambiguous order from our Russian ground station
13:31.900 - 13:34.220:  was interpreted by one of two Russian pilots
13:34.220 - 13:35.860:  as permission to fire.
13:36.440 - 13:38.760:  He released a missile, but it missed.
13:39.480 - 13:42.420:  Senior Western defence sources have confirmed to the BBC
13:42.540 - 13:45.260:  that around them broke out with his wingman
13:45.260 - 13:47.860:  who did not believe they had permission to fire.
13:48.500 - 13:51.260:  The rogue pilot still released a second missile.
13:51.840 - 13:53.580:  That one simply fell from the wing.
13:54.420 - 13:57.020:  While US defence officials later described the incident
13:57.020 - 13:59.840:  as a near-shoot-down and very scary,
14:00.460 - 14:03.160:  the UK Ministry of Defence accepted Russia's explanation
14:03.180 - 14:06.720:  of a malfunction, not wanting to reveal details
14:06.720 - 14:10.540:  of its intelligence gathering or escalate the situation.
14:11.060 - 14:11.680:  Jonathan Bill.
14:12.520 - 14:15.040:  The announcement of a rather unconventional marriage
14:15.040 - 14:16.820:  is currently the talk of social media
14:16.820 - 14:18.620:  as Princess Mertelouis of Norway,
14:18.620 - 14:20.220:  the eldest child of the king,
14:20.260 - 14:23.200:  a set of wedding date for her union to an American
14:23.200 - 14:25.340:  Derek Verett, a self-professed shaman
14:25.340 - 14:27.680:  and spiritual guru to the stars.
14:28.300 - 14:30.100:  A very young gossip girl, Stephanie Prentice,
14:30.220 - 14:31.080:  has been filling me in.
14:31.500 - 14:34.340:  This couple have been the subject of a scrutiny in Norway
14:34.340 - 14:37.560:  for a while, but the announcement of the details of their wedding
14:37.560 - 14:40.780:  it's made them more famous on the wider internet
14:40.780 - 14:44.100:  where shaman's are often subjected to a level of ridicule
14:44.100 - 14:46.960:  from some corners, so there's been a lot of discussion
14:46.960 - 14:49.780:  about this and no small amount of means.
14:50.620 - 14:53.180:  Now, this Ferrari is reminiscent of when the pair
14:53.180 - 14:55.300:  toured Norway back in 2019,
14:55.300 - 14:58.160:  that was under the brand The Princess and the Shaman.
14:58.760 - 15:00.480:  They, undernibly, did create waves.
15:00.480 - 15:02.180:  They discussed alternative beliefs,
15:02.180 - 15:05.000:  which included being able to communicate with angels,
15:05.440 - 15:06.780:  in fact, a broad range of spirits,
15:07.340 - 15:08.620:  a belief in ancient medicine,
15:09.240 - 15:11.900:  including using medallions to ward off dark energies
15:11.900 - 15:14.660:  and also a discussion around using spells.
15:15.520 - 15:17.820:  There's also been some more controversial claims
15:17.820 - 15:19.460:  from Mr Verett in the past.
15:19.460 - 15:21.960:  He suggested that cancer could be a choice
15:22.520 - 15:25.140:  and that medallions could ward off COVID-19.
15:25.140 - 15:28.760:  He, in fact, sold some online for more than $200 each.
15:29.320 - 15:31.700:  He's also reported claiming that he predicted 911
15:31.700 - 15:33.740:  about two years before it happened.
15:34.500 - 15:37.800:  Despite some of those unconventional claims and conventions,
15:38.040 - 15:40.160:  the royal family in Norway have given their blessing
15:40.160 - 15:41.080:  to this marriage, haven't they?
15:41.800 - 15:42.320:  They have indeed.
15:42.380 - 15:44.380:  We know Princess Mertlery has stepped back
15:44.380 - 15:46.460:  from her royal duties in the past few years,
15:46.460 - 15:49.200:  but she seems connected still to the royal family.
15:49.200 - 15:52.060:  Her father has given the union his blessing
15:52.540 - 15:53.320:  in a new statement.
15:53.320 - 15:54.760:  He congratulated the pair.
15:54.960 - 15:57.640:  He said that he was delighted about the upcoming wedding
15:57.640 - 16:01.520:  and that he was happy to welcome Mr Verett into his family.
16:01.920 - 16:03.020:  That was Stephanie Prentice.
16:05.400 - 16:06.000:  Still to come?
16:06.280 - 16:07.160:  Puffs are colorful.
16:07.160 - 16:08.740:  They were talking about it on TikTok.
16:08.740 - 16:10.080:  So I thought, why not?
16:10.460 - 16:11.280:  And that's why I started.
16:11.820 - 16:13.660:  My French lawmakers may sue me saying,
16:13.720 - 16:14.920:  not to vapes.
16:22.320 - 16:25.160:  HEATWaves, floods, droughts, wildfires.
16:25.340 - 16:28.100:  Catastrophic consequences from climate change.
16:28.100 - 16:29.600:  What's going on is this real.
16:29.860 - 16:31.480:  The climate question is the podcast
16:31.480 - 16:33.880:  exploring our planet's changing environment
16:34.060 - 16:35.740:  and what we're doing across the world
16:35.740 - 16:37.300:  to adapt and respond to it.
16:37.320 - 16:40.560:  The future is ahead of us, a very sensitive to the choices
16:40.900 - 16:41.740:  that they make today.
16:41.740 - 16:44.360:  If we don't start fixing it, we're going to be victims of it.
16:44.420 - 16:45.220:  God engaged.
16:45.220 - 16:48.000:  The climate question from the BBC World Service,
16:48.360 - 16:50.580:  find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
16:51.780 - 16:53.540:  You're listening to the Global News Podcast.
16:53.540 - 16:55.140:  Let's take you to Vietnam now
16:55.140 - 16:57.080:  because in the capital Hanoi yesterday,
16:57.740 - 16:58.840:  deep in a maze of streets,
16:58.840 - 17:01.520:  a fire broke out at a small apartment building.
17:02.020 - 17:03.900:  The flames blocked the only exit
17:03.900 - 17:06.760:  and fire trucks couldn't reach the site due to narrow roads.
17:07.340 - 17:08.640:  56 people died.
17:09.000 - 17:11.360:  Today, the government's ordered a nationwide safety check
17:11.360 - 17:13.820:  on similar buildings to prevent another disaster.
17:14.380 - 17:17.220:  For more on this, I spoke to our Asia-Pacific regional editor,
17:17.660 - 17:18.340:  Celia Hutton.
17:18.720 - 17:20.620:  Well, it really is striking, Gareth, to see
17:21.360 - 17:23.880:  what's happening in Vietnam in response to this fire.
17:23.880 - 17:26.540:  You know, it's a country of almost 100 million people
17:26.540 - 17:29.340:  and the strength of attention that's been focused on
17:29.740 - 17:32.140:  the inhabitants of that one building,
17:32.140 - 17:37.200:  very narrow tall apartment building in the center of Hanoi
17:37.200 - 17:40.640:  where 150 people were really packed into nine floors.
17:41.360 - 17:44.420:  And there are many people now asking why so many died
17:44.420 - 17:46.340:  in such a short period of time
17:46.340 - 17:48.700:  because it only took the firefighters an hour
17:49.240 - 17:51.500:  to put out the fire once they reached this spot.
17:51.540 - 17:52.660:  But that was really the challenge.
17:52.660 - 17:54.840:  Getting through narrow alleyways,
17:54.840 - 17:58.100:  getting their supplies there in order to put the fire out
17:58.140 - 17:59.860:  and also the design of the building
17:59.860 - 18:02.300:  because it had a really narrow staircase
18:02.300 - 18:03.460:  going up through the middle,
18:03.940 - 18:07.140:  which was the only way that people could travel through the building
18:07.460 - 18:08.620:  and it acted as a funnel.
18:08.780 - 18:11.040:  The fire started in the very bottom of the building
18:11.040 - 18:14.100:  and sent flames and smoke right up through the middle.
18:14.680 - 18:16.760:  People were really trapped inside their apartments
18:16.760 - 18:18.740:  because there were bars on all the windows
18:18.740 - 18:21.120:  and they really were meant to keep thieves out
18:21.120 - 18:22.700:  but they trapped people inside.
18:22.700 - 18:23.920:  They acted like cages.
18:23.920 - 18:26.300:  And so there are some heartwarming stories
18:26.300 - 18:29.020:  of parents who grabbed small children
18:29.020 - 18:32.600:  and literally leaped from one building onto the roof of another
18:32.600 - 18:35.360:  to save their children and they survived.
18:35.580 - 18:37.400:  But there are so many who didn't
18:37.400 - 18:39.960:  and that's why there's really nationwide grief
18:39.960 - 18:41.040:  across Vietnam today.
18:41.560 - 18:43.320:  Considering how deadly this incident is,
18:43.600 - 18:45.000:  considering how many elements came together
18:45.000 - 18:47.720:  to make the situation even worse than it maybe could have been,
18:48.160 - 18:50.720:  what's being done to prevent more cases like this?
18:50.980 - 18:54.520:  Well, the irony is that Vietnam actually has quite strict
18:54.520 - 18:56.420:  fire safety regulations
18:56.540 - 18:59.180:  but they're only really being applied to new buildings
18:59.180 - 19:02.300:  and so we have a lot of multinational companies complaining
19:02.300 - 19:05.620:  that they can't get their new factories approved
19:05.620 - 19:08.180:  because the fire safety just isn't up to scratch.
19:08.180 - 19:11.000:  However, there's so many, many poor people
19:11.400 - 19:13.640:  who live in these so-called tube buildings,
19:13.640 - 19:17.600:  very tall, thin buildings with only one entrance and exit
19:17.980 - 19:20.820:  and that's really where questions are being raised today.
19:20.820 - 19:23.860:  So fire safety chiefs have been ordered
19:23.860 - 19:26.620:  to check every single apartment building in the country.
19:26.620 - 19:28.820:  They're talking about fire safety education,
19:28.980 - 19:32.220:  you know, making sure there are exits available to all buildings
19:32.220 - 19:36.540:  but really the concern today is the contrast between rich people
19:36.540 - 19:39.720:  who live in typically newer fires, checked buildings
19:39.720 - 19:41.540:  and poor people who don't.
19:41.840 - 19:42.600:  Celia Hatton.
19:43.300 - 19:45.260:  Now to a somewhat unlikely clash
19:45.280 - 19:47.420:  as officials in Taiwan have hit back
19:47.420 - 19:49.400:  at the billionaire businessman Elon Musk,
19:49.400 - 19:53.080:  he suggested the country was an integral part of China.
19:53.660 - 19:55.700:  Using the ex-platform formerly Twitter
19:55.700 - 19:58.760:  that's owned by Mr. Musk, Taiwan's foreign minister wrote,
19:58.760 - 20:01.680:  listen up, Taiwan is not part of the PRC
20:02.040 - 20:03.820:  and certainly not for sale.
20:04.240 - 20:07.080:  The spat plays into broad attentions brewing in the region.
20:07.180 - 20:10.120:  I spoke to our China media analyst, Carrie Allen.
20:10.560 - 20:13.980:  He made these comments at the All-In Summit in Los Angeles,
20:13.980 - 20:16.220:  which was earlier this week, it's a three-day summit
20:16.640 - 20:19.240:  and it covers speakers at this event,
20:19.240 - 20:23.300:  cover a range of topics and Musk was also talking about Ukraine,
20:23.300 - 20:27.260:  AI, the creator economy and China was a big talking point
20:27.260 - 20:29.660:  because Musk was only in China in June,
20:29.660 - 20:33.380:  he has business in the country as part of his work with Tesla
20:33.900 - 20:35.460:  and he did say at this event
20:35.520 - 20:37.460:  that he thinks he understands China well.
20:37.460 - 20:40.820:  He's met with officials and yes, he's got factories in Shanghai,
20:41.400 - 20:45.820:  but yeah, he commented that he felt that Taiwan was similar
20:45.820 - 20:48.740:  to Hawaii and this really didn't go down well.
20:48.740 - 20:51.740:  It led to Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu,
20:51.960 - 20:55.240:  saying, listen up, Taiwan is not a part of the people's
20:55.240 - 20:57.480:  Republic of China and it's certainly not for sale.
20:57.800 - 21:00.480:  And this has been a big talking point today on X,
21:00.480 - 21:02.480:  the platform formerly known as Twitter
21:02.480 - 21:05.820:  obviously Mr. Muscones, with both sides,
21:05.820 - 21:07.840:  people from state media in China,
21:08.260 - 21:11.560:  applauding him for saying this and people from Taiwan,
21:11.980 - 21:13.240:  very, very critical of it.
21:13.460 - 21:15.400:  Because it's worth remembering, isn't it, Kerry,
21:15.400 - 21:17.860:  that Taiwan's democratically elected government
21:17.860 - 21:21.220:  strongly rejects any sovereignty claim by Beijing,
21:21.220 - 21:25.960:  by China, but the China has vowed to take back control
21:25.960 - 21:28.820:  of Taiwan and if it requires force, then so bit.
21:29.580 - 21:30.200:  Absolutely, yes.
21:30.260 - 21:31.960:  I mean, Taiwan is an island that has,
21:32.280 - 21:35.240:  for all practical purposes, been independent since 1950.
21:35.920 - 21:38.700:  But China sees this, the Beijing government sees this
21:38.700 - 21:41.400:  as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland,
21:41.400 - 21:42.800:  by force if necessary.
21:43.140 - 21:45.320:  And it has been the case that Beijing has been increasing
21:45.320 - 21:47.440:  pressure on Taiwan through various means,
21:47.440 - 21:49.800:  economic, diplomatic, military.
21:50.280 - 21:53.680:  And only this week, Taiwan has seen large scale Chinese
21:53.680 - 21:57.340:  military activity round the islands.
21:57.520 - 22:00.560:  So yeah, it is a particularly tense time
22:00.560 - 22:03.880:  and not a very good time for must to be making a comment
22:03.880 - 22:07.480:  as politically tense as this.
22:07.960 - 22:10.300:  Kerry Allen, an Australian multi-millionaire
22:10.300 - 22:12.740:  has apologized after some very divisive comments
22:12.740 - 22:16.080:  that have been viewed on TikTok more than 11 million times.
22:16.660 - 22:19.060:  Let's hear a bit of what Tim Gerner had to say.
22:19.480 - 22:22.080:  People decided they didn't really want to work so much anymore
22:22.080 - 22:25.040:  through COVID and that has had a massive issue on productivity.
22:25.600 - 22:27.860:  Tradeys have definitely pulled back on productivity.
22:28.560 - 22:32.300:  They have been paid a lot to do not too much
22:32.460 - 22:33.420:  in the last few years.
22:33.900 - 22:34.800:  And we need to see that change.
22:34.920 - 22:36.220:  We need to see unemployment rise.
22:36.220 - 22:38.920:  Unemployment has to jump 40%, 50% in my view.
22:39.380 - 22:40.700:  We need to see pain in the economy.
22:40.700 - 22:43.560:  We need to remind people that they work for the employer,
22:43.920 - 22:44.920:  not the other way around.
22:45.220 - 22:46.680:  It's a dynamic that has to change.
22:46.680 - 22:47.980:  We've got to kill that attitude
22:47.980 - 22:50.560:  and that has to come through hurting the economy,
22:50.560 - 22:54.800:  which is what the whole global world is trying to do.
22:54.800 - 22:57.020:  The governments around the world are trying to increase unemployment
22:57.140 - 23:00.700:  to get that to some sort of normality.
23:01.220 - 23:02.680:  Well, before Mr. Gerner's apology,
23:02.680 - 23:06.680:  our piece is correspondent Katie Silver gave me her take on his comments.
23:07.060 - 23:10.640:  Post COVID, there's been a huge shortage of workers.
23:10.800 - 23:13.180:  I remember I was in Australia at the start of last year
23:13.180 - 23:14.980:  and I remember just, you couldn't go past a shop
23:14.980 - 23:17.620:  without urgent demands for workers.
23:18.240 - 23:20.260:  So in that sense, there's perhaps some merit there.
23:20.260 - 23:21.360:  The power dynamic has changed.
23:21.700 - 23:24.660:  Whether or not we therefore need to see unemployment
23:24.660 - 23:28.940:  and economic hurt, Australia actually has had a pretty successful go
23:28.940 - 23:31.820:  at reducing their inflation despite
23:32.480 - 23:34.440:  maintaining a relatively strong level of employment.
23:34.440 - 23:36.520:  So I don't necessarily think there's merit there,
23:36.520 - 23:38.700:  but it does go back to that wider issue
23:38.700 - 23:40.940:  that we're talking about time and time again about how
23:41.640 - 23:44.900:  the COVID pandemic has changed the feelings for many workers,
23:45.300 - 23:46.320:  their employees' attitude.
23:46.340 - 23:48.260:  And whether or not they've put work first
23:48.260 - 23:51.320:  or that kind of rise of terms like quiet quitting
23:51.320 - 23:54.580:  and the way many people now feel about their jobs post the pandemic.
23:55.340 - 23:58.680:  So considering then that societal shift that you talk about there,
23:58.680 - 24:01.780:  how does that mean people are viewing his comments today?
24:02.680 - 24:04.420:  Oh, they've been hugely criticised.
24:04.420 - 24:07.960:  Like, in Australia, to give you an idea from both sides of the politics,
24:07.960 - 24:10.400:  one Labour MP said they were the sort of comments
24:10.400 - 24:12.400:  you'd associate with a cartoon villain.
24:12.960 - 24:15.260:  Another one from the other side of politics, a Liberal Party,
24:15.600 - 24:17.460:  said that he could not be more out of touch
24:17.980 - 24:20.100:  and that the loss of a job is not a number.
24:20.260 - 24:22.620:  It sees people on the streets independent on food banks.
24:22.740 - 24:26.060:  So it's certainly really divisive, really annoyed people.
24:26.060 - 24:27.960:  And the fact that he's now worth about $600 million,
24:28.840 - 24:30.000:  he's previously spoken, for example,
24:30.000 - 24:34.020:  about how he received a leg up from loans from his grandfather.
24:34.660 - 24:40.800:  And so that sort of discourse and that kind of concept of family generational wealth
24:41.280 - 24:43.480:  certainly doesn't play in well when it's all combined.
24:43.740 - 24:46.000:  No, and briefly, it's been noted, hasn't it,
24:46.000 - 24:49.100:  that the disparity between CEO wealth and worker wealth
24:49.100 - 24:50.980:  is the greatest ever extent now.
24:51.380 - 24:55.480:  That's right, those comments were made by the US Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.
24:55.480 - 24:58.280:  So criticisms even going as far as the United States.
24:58.700 - 25:00.020:  And that's because we are seeing as well
25:00.020 - 25:01.240:  with this cost of living crisis,
25:01.240 - 25:02.860:  it's hitting poor people harder.
25:03.300 - 25:05.860:  And therefore, these sorts of comments couldn't really seem
25:06.280 - 25:08.200:  more, as one of those Labour MPs said,
25:08.200 - 25:12.020:  more tone-deaf in the current context of the cost of living crisis.
25:12.540 - 25:14.240:  Well, in his apology, Mr. Gerner,
25:14.240 - 25:16.840:  said his comments had been deeply insensitive
25:16.840 - 25:20.100:  to employees, tradespeople, and families across Australia
25:20.100 - 25:23.900:  who are affected by cost of living pressures and job losses.
25:25.160 - 25:27.500:  In France, a ban on disposable e-cigarettes,
25:27.500 - 25:31.160:  known there as puffs, is expected to come into force by the end of the year.
25:31.620 - 25:34.080:  Anti-smoking campaigners say children are being targeted
25:34.080 - 25:36.200:  to draw them into taking up the habit for life.
25:36.840 - 25:39.440:  Several other countries in Europe, including Germany, Belgium,
25:39.440 - 25:43.000:  and Ireland have announced similar bans and Britons also said to be considering one.
25:43.500 - 25:46.220:  Our correspondent in Paris, Hugh Schofield, sent this report.
25:46.780 - 25:50.280:  So, for those of you who haven't seen one of these things,
25:50.860 - 25:54.940:  what I've just bought there is an Elfbar 600,
25:55.220 - 25:57.640:  lime green in colour, pompech, that's apple peach in flavour.
26:01.020 - 26:03.860:  There's a science bar to under 18-year-olds,
26:04.760 - 26:08.580:  and it's made, it says, by the I-miracle technology company of Shen-Gen,
26:08.580 - 26:14.660:  China, and when I open it up, you get out a capsule wrapped up nicely in a kind of medium-length,
26:14.660 - 26:20.000:  medium-thickness cigar in lime green with a kind of lip attachment down one end.
26:22.680 - 26:25.100:  But it's not me, or the likes of me, that's the main target of the business.
26:25.100 - 26:30.320:  It's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me,
26:31.860 - 26:38.100:  it's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me.
26:38.100 - 26:40.200:  The target of the makers of puffs is young people,
26:40.420 - 26:43.720:  the kind who are watching influencers like this on social media,
26:44.120 - 26:46.320:  as they sing the praises of the different flavours,
26:46.320 - 26:49.440:  chocolate and hazelnut, watermelon, marshmallow.
26:51.780 - 26:54.320:  Little wonder, according to the figures presented by opponents,
26:54.320 - 27:01.260:  some 13% of children aged between 13 and 16 have tried disposable vapes at least once.
27:02.080 - 27:05.420:  One of them, Sam, I met on the street near his school in Paris.
27:06.420 - 27:12.900:  The puffs are colourful, and in my head, they're not as dangerous as cigarettes.
27:13.540 - 27:16.080:  The flavours are aimed at children, and they're nice.
27:16.080 - 27:18.580:  My favourites are ice-grape in Africa.
27:21.700 - 27:25.440:  It was about two years ago, they were talking about it on TikTok.
27:25.440 - 27:27.980:  It was kind of a trend, so I thought, why not?
27:28.380 - 27:29.120:  And that's why I started.
27:30.760 - 27:33.120:  The French government is concerned by two sets of figures,
27:33.600 - 27:36.440:  one that chose smoking in general, picking up again,
27:36.460 - 27:39.620:  and the other that use of e-cigarettes of all kinds
27:39.620 - 27:42.620:  among young people tripled in the last five years.
27:43.040 - 27:44.300:  They're worried there's a connection.
27:49.540 - 27:51.460:  The last week, Prime Minister Elizabeth Bourne
27:51.460 - 27:53.420:  appeared on the radio to make the announcement.
27:56.340 - 27:59.620:  We'll soon be presenting our new anti-smoking plan,
27:59.800 - 28:03.880:  and one of its key elements will be a ban on disposable e-cigarettes.
28:04.600 - 28:08.640:  These famous puffs which cost such bad habits among our young people.
28:09.600 - 28:13.960:  You may say there is no nicotine in them, but what they do is create a reflex.
28:14.460 - 28:17.860:  Children get used to it and end up being thrown to tobacco.
28:19.700 - 28:23.560:  That packet I bought at the beginning cost me €9.50.
28:23.660 - 28:25.180:  That's less than a packet of cigarettes,
28:25.180 - 28:27.580:  and with 600 puffs advertised,
28:27.580 - 28:30.440:  it's the equivalent in puffs of two packets.
28:30.880 - 28:33.940:  And don't forget that while some disposable vapes are nicotine-free,
28:33.940 - 28:36.300:  most, like this one, are not.
28:37.100 - 28:40.740:  This is me, finally, trying out the Elf Barth 600.
28:44.560 - 28:45.960:  It's like smoking sweets.
28:47.060 - 28:51.640:  Horrible, but I imagine for children very, very morish.
28:52.420 - 28:54.040:  The BBC's huge scope field.
28:54.440 - 28:58.560:  We end this global news podcast in Australia where the Palm Cockatoo
28:58.940 - 29:00.900:  is known for being unique in the animal kingdom
29:00.900 - 29:04.640:  for using bits of wood as drumsticks to tap out rhythmic beats.
29:05.280 - 29:06.460:  As arguably with humans,
29:06.460 - 29:10.440:  it all forms part of a complex ritual to try and attract a mate.
29:11.100 - 29:13.980:  Now, scientists from the Australian National University
29:13.980 - 29:16.300:  have released a research paper with more details
29:16.300 - 29:18.300:  about the parrot's romantic schemes.
29:18.800 - 29:20.820:  Professor Robert Heinschen was part of the study.
29:21.460 - 29:23.820:  So they have a really elaborate sort of display
29:23.820 - 29:27.300:  which involves combinations of 30 different cold types.
29:27.320 - 29:30.860:  The males erect their very impressive crests
29:31.000 - 29:32.500:  reach for the sky with their crests,
29:32.740 - 29:35.180:  and they dance, and they bob, and they twirl on the branch.
29:35.180 - 29:37.020:  And then, as if that isn't enough,
29:37.640 - 29:38.620:  at the end of all of that,
29:38.860 - 29:41.220:  the male will sort of waddle out to the end of the branch.
29:41.980 - 29:44.640:  And he'll sniff off a stick or a seed pod
29:44.640 - 29:49.140:  and he'll spend some time fashioning that into a sound tool.
29:49.560 - 29:51.120:  And he'll start capping rhythmically
29:51.760 - 29:53.200:  against the side of the hollow.
29:56.160 - 29:57.880:  Every male has his own drumming signature.
29:58.260 - 30:02.880:  And now we find that the style of their drumsticks differs as well
30:02.880 - 30:05.940:  and they're making different shapes and sizes of their drumsticks.
30:06.340 - 30:08.940:  And making the sticks seems to be part of the display
30:08.940 - 30:11.140:  because the females are watching their every move.
30:11.540 - 30:13.020:  And the males are actually showing off
30:13.240 - 30:15.120:  by, you know, how thick a stick they can cut off
30:15.120 - 30:16.200:  with their powerful bills.
30:16.500 - 30:19.000:  And then they whittling it down to the size and shape that they like.
30:19.260 - 30:20.960:  And the females are just a couple of meters away
30:20.960 - 30:23.300:  just watching really intently their every move.
30:23.980 - 30:27.340:  Well, it would be remiss not to give a drumming palm cockatoo
30:27.340 - 30:29.640:  a moment in the spotlight here on the Globingy's podcast.
30:29.640 - 30:31.320:  So take a listen, see what you think.
30:37.960 - 30:40.700:  Personally, I think it sounds like mild construction work,
30:40.720 - 30:42.320:  but I'll leave you to have your own opinion.

31:00.840 - 31:01.540:  I'm Gareth Barlow.
31:01.700 - 31:02.840:  Until next time, goodbye.
