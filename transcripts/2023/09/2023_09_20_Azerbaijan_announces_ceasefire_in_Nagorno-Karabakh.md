*01:10.520- 01:15.960* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 20th of September, these are our main
*01:15.960- 01:21.860* :  stories. The government of Azerbaijan has announced a ceasefire with ethnic Armenians in the
*01:21.860- 01:28.380* :  contested territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Parliament in Iran has passed a law that could see women
*01:28.380- 01:35.280* :  jails for up to 10 years for failing to adhere to Islamic dress rules. Most of the Spanish
*01:35.280- 01:39.920* :  women's football team have agreed to end their boycott in return for reforms.
*01:43.720- 01:47.980* :  Also in this podcast. Another word for today I may already have been this
*01:47.980- 01:51.360* :  Sunday prompt. I think a lot of this will be Sunday prompt today.
*01:52.080- 01:58.220* :  The author who is going back centuries to show how words have the power to make people happy.
*02:03.400- 02:09.140* :  We begin this podcast in a fragile region long contested by Azerbaijan and Armenia.
*02:14.500- 02:19.600* :  Just today after it launched a military operation in the breakaway territory of Nagorno-Karabakh,
*02:19.900- 02:25.860* :  Azerbaijan has now halted the fighting. This comes after the separatist forces in the enclave which
*02:25.860- 02:32.260* :  is mostly inhabited by ethnic Armenians agreed to a ceasefire. The separatists say more than 30
*02:32.260- 02:38.500* :  people including children have been killed in a day of conflict in which they were out manned
*02:38.500- 02:45.320* :  and outgunned. The ceasefire put forward by Russian peacekeepers will see local fighters disarmed
*02:45.320- 02:52.200* :  and talks between both sides on how to integrate the territory into Azerbaijan. A special envoy to
*02:52.200- 02:58.420* :  the Azeri president Elchin Amir Bekhov confirmed the fighting was over in an interview with the BBC.
*02:59.320- 03:03.720* :  There is an end to the fighting I can confirm to you because that was the agreement from
*03:04.080- 03:10.660* :  both sides that in case we receive the agreement of the Armenian separatists to lay arms
*03:10.660- 03:17.940* :  and to produce their own statement then of course we will reciprocate. Both agreements have been
*03:17.940- 03:24.360* :  reached with the facilitation of the Russian peacekeeping contingent which is on the spot.
*03:25.060- 03:31.120* :  Since they are the only ones who have presence on the ground and who have been in constant touch
*03:31.720- 03:37.380* :  since the start of these measures. Since yesterday I think they have to be counted on
*03:37.380- 03:42.540* :  for the implementation part. Meanwhile the European Union says it's monitoring the situation.
*03:43.040- 03:46.300* :  Lukpaje Davinia is with the European External Action Service.
*03:47.140- 03:53.880* :  Literally a few minutes before walking into this room we heard that allegedly this was announced by
*03:53.880- 04:03.140* :  some media, a ceasefire would take place between Karabakhiri, de facto authorities and Azeri
*04:03.680- 04:07.680* :  remains to be seen. What is going to come next?
*04:08.480- 04:13.640* :  So is this a victory for Azerbaijan? Rehandomitri is our correspondent in the region.
*04:14.440- 04:20.340* :  It increasingly looks like it is a victory for Azerbaijan and it looks like a complete surrender by
*04:20.340- 04:28.000* :  the ethnic Armenian leadership of Nagorno-Karabakh. Interestingly since we last spoke
*04:28.000- 04:34.360* :  Janet Nikol Pashinyan, the Prime Minister of Armenia, he made a statement and he said that
*04:34.360- 04:40.940* :  Armenia was not part of the negotiations on the ceasefire agreement and also he said that
*04:40.940- 04:47.320* :  it was not clear to Armenia why the Armenian armed forces are being mentioned in the ceasefire
*04:47.320- 04:55.820* :  because the last Armenian military left Nagorno-Karabakh he said in August 2021 and also
*04:55.820- 05:01.740* :  Pashinyan said that now of course it will be the obligation and responsibility of Russian peace
*05:01.740- 05:10.600* :  keepers to ensure the safety of ethnic Armenians. Meanwhile since the ceasefire that was announced at
*05:10.600- 05:17.220* :  1300 local time we are hearing from the journalists on the ground that the sound of gunfire had
*05:17.220- 05:23.800* :  stopped but it is really not that clear what's happening to the civilian population. So some reports
*05:23.800- 05:28.860* :  are saying that people are still hesitant to leave their bomb shelters and basements because
*05:28.860- 05:34.400* :  it's not clear what's happening to them. I've seen some photographs and videos showing
*05:35.260- 05:41.180* :  a lot of people like hundreds of people as much as we can judge by those pictures gathering
*05:41.180- 05:49.040* :  in the regional airport which hasn't been functioning ever actually but they are there and
*05:49.040- 05:53.420* :  I suppose in the hope of being evacuated from Nagorno-Karabakh.
*05:53.700- 05:57.240* :  And you talked about this statement that Russian peace keepers when I have to ensure the safety
*05:57.240- 06:02.680* :  of Armenians in the enclaves there's only about 2000 Russian peace keepers more than 100,000
*06:02.680- 06:08.780* :  Armenians very uncertain future for them. Very uncertain future and probably like for a lot of
*06:08.780- 06:15.800* :  Armenians it is just the worst nightmare now because for a lot of them it's unimaginable to be part
*06:15.800- 06:22.360* :  of Azerbaijan because you know they've been fighting they've been at war for many decades
*06:23.280- 06:29.060* :  but where to go it is also not clear but I think a lot will depend on what will come out of the
*06:29.060- 06:36.000* :  talks that are scheduled for tomorrow between the ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijan in the Azerbaijani
*06:36.000- 06:41.580* :  town where the safety and security of Karabakh Armenians will be on the agenda.
*06:42.400- 06:48.660* :  Rayhan Dimitri. Since widespread protests erupted across Iran a year ago sparked by the death
*06:48.660- 06:53.640* :  in police custody of Masa Amini many women have refused to cover their hair.
*06:54.320- 07:00.400* :  Now just days after many Iranians marked the anniversary of Masa Amini's death lawmakers in Iran
*07:00.400- 07:08.360* :  have passed a bill that could see women being jailed for up to 10 years if they continue to defy
*07:08.360- 07:14.180* :  the Iranian regime's draconian dress code. Our Middle East analyst Mike Thompson told us more.
*07:14.960- 07:20.540* :  It's called the hijab and chastity bill and it was passed by big majority in the parliament there.
*07:20.860- 07:27.320* :  It's to be trialed for three years so they're going to evaluate how successful it is and it's
*07:27.320- 07:32.920* :  all going to be part of the continuing crackdown. There's been morality police patrols reintroduced
*07:32.920- 07:39.560* :  on the streets surveillance cameras and the closure of non-compliant businesses. A big water park
*07:39.560- 07:45.740* :  in Meshad earlier this month for instance that was closed down because a lot of customers weren't
*07:45.740- 07:51.940* :  covering their hair and some women are even being subjected to court mandated therapy.
*07:52.360- 07:56.180* :  So there's all these measures that the authority is the same they are taking but they clearly
*07:56.180- 08:00.880* :  don't feel that they're enough so they're introducing this bill but how is this likely to go down
*08:00.880- 08:07.980* :  with women who have continued to defy these dress rules despite all these pressures being
*08:07.980- 08:13.080* :  brought in them? Well so far there's no sign that women have been wilting in the face of this crack
*08:13.080- 08:18.820* :  down that's been going on for some time. We've seen many particularly in places like Tehran,
*08:18.820- 08:26.100* :  the big cities openly flouting the headscarf rule. There've been pop songs celebrating not wearing a
*08:26.100- 08:34.300* :  headscarf and many well-known actresses actors talking about how this should be ignored. So it seems
*08:34.300- 08:41.300* :  hard to understand really how this is going to impact other than it may even encourage more women
*08:41.300- 08:48.140* :  rather less to flout the rules because of the anger over this infringement of what many feel to
*08:48.140- 08:54.220* :  be their right. And it's not going to be good news for Iran's international reputation either.
*08:54.840- 09:00.500* :  No, when you're at the moment we have the Iranian President Ibrahim Reisi that the UN General Assembly
*09:00.500- 09:06.660* :  in New York and he's meeting with various heads of state he's also meeting with US politicians,
*09:06.660- 09:12.000* :  international organizations and some American journalists. All of this I think is to try and
*09:12.000- 09:19.540* :  give a softer image to his country with acceptable image but things like this I'm not going to help
*09:19.540- 09:25.280* :  but we've had demonstrations outside the building against him mainly exiled Iranians calling for him
*09:25.280- 09:30.420* :  to be in court rather than at the UN Assembly and you get the feeling that this is only going to
*09:30.420- 09:37.660* :  lead to even more of those. Mike Thompson the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has warned that
*09:37.660- 09:44.280* :  evil cannot be trusted and that a nuclear armed Russia must be stopped from pushing the world
*09:44.280- 09:51.260* :  to the final war in a passionate speech to over a hundred leaders at the UN General Assembly in
*09:51.260- 09:57.220* :  New York. Later today Ukraine's wartime president will address a special session of the UN
*09:57.220- 10:02.640* :  Security Council the first time he'll have done so in person. Netodolfik reports.
*10:06.700- 10:11.260* :  Attention was always going to be high on President Vladimir Zelensky during this
*10:11.300- 10:15.700* :  his first visit to the UN General Assembly since the war in Ukraine began.
*10:17.420- 10:22.940* :  On the agenda a round of press interviews and key meetings with his counterparts who have an
*10:22.960- 10:28.200* :  outright condemned Russia for its invasion such as South Africa's Cyril from Oposa.
*10:32.980- 10:38.080* :  The wartime president has focused his efforts here and indeed his address to the General Assembly
*10:38.080- 10:43.080* :  on making his case that the war in his homeland is a great threat to all nations.
*10:43.240- 10:52.220* :  And the goal of them present war against Ukraine is to tour our lands, our people, our lives,
*10:52.220- 10:58.620* :  our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order.
*11:00.820- 11:10.480* :  Many seats in the General Assembly hall may become empty if Russia succeeds with its
*11:10.480- 11:16.120* :  territory and aggression. While many members of the UN want the focus to be on peace talks,
*11:16.120- 11:21.340* :  Western leaders maintain that it must not come at the expense of Ukraine's sovereignty.
*11:21.420- 11:27.160* :  On Wednesday President Zelensky will attend a special meeting of the Security Council where he
*11:27.160- 11:33.780* :  plans to lay out details of his peace formula. While the war in Ukraine is not the only focus here,
*11:33.780- 11:39.320* :  I'm standing in the UN Plaza outside of the General Assembly building where there are several
*11:39.320- 11:45.940* :  displays listing out each of the 17 sustainable development goals including climate action,
*11:45.940- 11:51.920* :  no poverty, and good health. And the UN has gone to great lengths this year to put the emphasis
*11:52.240- 11:56.000* :  squarely on these issues, one's important to the global South.
*12:01.240- 12:05.720* :  Leaders are arriving at this high level week off the back of the hottest summer on record.
*12:06.200- 12:09.760* :  On behalf of the General Assembly, I have the honor to welcome
*12:09.980- 12:17.240* :  his excellency, Joseph Arby. Among those alarmed by the climate crisis was President Joe Biden,
*12:17.240- 12:21.560* :  who told those assembled that it was an existential threat to all of humanity.
*12:40.780- 12:48.680* :  Thousands, thousands of people together, these snapshots tell an urgent story of what awaits us if
*12:48.680- 12:54.560* :  we fail to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and begin to climate proof the world.
*12:55.080- 13:00.480* :  The Secretary General Antonio Guterres says actions are falling abysmally short. He will be
*13:00.480- 13:05.660* :  holding a climate ambition summit Wednesday where only first movers and doers will be allowed
*13:06.140- 13:11.500* :  to speak. And with global divisions deepening and sometimes paralyzing international cooperation,
*13:11.500- 13:16.880* :  the Secretary General told the Assembly it was time to reform the organization he leads
*13:17.260- 13:20.580* :  and the financial system to better reflect today's realities.
*13:20.580- 13:26.860* :  I have no illusions. Reforms are a question of power. And I know there are many competing
*13:26.860- 13:34.400* :  interests and agendas, but the alternative to reform is not the status quo. The alternative
*13:34.400- 13:41.540* :  to reform is further fragmentation. It is reform or rupture. Among those in agreement,
*13:41.540- 13:48.720* :  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Security Council has ceased to be the guarantor
*13:48.720- 13:55.640* :  of world security and has become a battleground for the political strategies of only five countries.
*13:58.000- 14:02.820* :  The UN may be losing some of its power, but with so many challenges facing the globe,
*14:02.820- 14:07.840* :  it is still the one place where all nations of the world can come together and talk.
*14:09.760- 14:13.900* :  Nettaurfik Many global news podcast listeners around the world
*14:13.900- 14:21.000* :  may be experiencing the mubble fubbles today, or be about to be thunderplumpt. These terms are
*14:21.000- 14:26.000* :  centuries old and they've been put together by author Suzy Dent in her new book for children,
*14:26.000- 14:31.120* :  Roots of Happiness, celebrating the joy to be found in the use of different words.
*14:31.120- 14:35.660* :  She spoke to my colleague Nick Robinson. The mubble fubbles is a rather
*14:35.660- 14:40.500* :  cuddly way of saying that you're feeling a little bit blue and melancholy. I think just saying
*14:40.500- 14:44.620* :  it cheers you up a little bit and they obviously had them young in the 17th century.
*14:45.160- 14:49.220* :  And a giggle bug presumably is what it seems to be, which is somewhat a smile of the face.
*14:49.560- 14:53.360* :  Someone who is consistently smiling and of course for adults, we would probably introduce
*14:53.360- 14:57.760* :  a picture cynicism and say they completely can ruin your day. Somebody who never stops
*14:57.760- 15:01.920* :  smiling particularly first thing in the morning. But for children hopefully it's a really happy thing.
*15:02.280- 15:07.520* :  Do you think positive language never mind positive emotions and thoughts that just positive
*15:07.520- 15:12.880* :  words can make a difference to how we all feel? I really do actually. So in the course of my
*15:12.980- 15:17.440* :  said dictionary work, I just noticed how much our language tends to focus on the bad side and
*15:17.440- 15:22.520* :  see me side of life. And there is a lot of research actually showing that by having the words
*15:22.520- 15:27.320* :  to describe happy feelings we can feel that happiness directly. So obviously words have
*15:27.320- 15:32.240* :  incredible power. It's something called emotional granularity. It's what psychologists have
*15:32.240- 15:36.780* :  calling it. And it's all about having vocabulary to articulate how you feel and that in turn
*15:36.780- 15:41.000* :  can actually allow you to harness those emotions, which is incredible. So give us some more words
*15:41.000- 15:46.860* :  that we might use today. What about a word for describing the fact that we feel good that someone
*15:46.860- 15:53.820* :  else is happy? Oh, this is one of my absolute favourites. Yes, this is confolicity and confolicity
*15:53.820- 15:58.460* :  is almost the opposite of Schadenfreude, which we all know from German. And you just
*15:58.460- 16:02.880* :  enjoy it and someone else is happiness. So it's completely altruistic. We just feel their happiness
*16:02.880- 16:09.300* :  and are joyful for them, which is lovely. Another word for today, thunder plumped. I think a lot of
*16:09.300- 16:14.360* :  this will be thunder plumped today. This is to be soaked to the skin in seconds from a very heavy
*16:14.360- 16:18.880* :  damper. But if you're enjoying the warmth of the sun on a winter's day, there's a word for that,
*16:18.880- 16:22.960* :  isn't it? And you don't need German. Usually you do need German for complicated concepts,
*16:22.960- 16:27.140* :  all summed up in a single word. It's food, it's like Legos, isn't it? But yes, there's a word for
*16:27.140- 16:30.700* :  this as well. I'm on a mission to bring this one back, as are some weather forecast, it's actually
*16:30.700- 16:36.640* :  it's April City, the warmth of the sun on your back on a chilly winter's day. Lovely word, that was
*16:36.900- 16:41.220* :  Suzy Dent. Still to come.
*16:48.100- 16:54.760* :  How a performer in an opera was able to turn the tables on a critic who was rude about her appearance.
*17:03.780- 17:08.180* :  Our planet's climate is changing. We are in the midst of a climate crisis. The climate question
*17:08.180- 17:13.320* :  speaks to those hit the hardest. The problems caused by deforestation and the environment are huge,
*17:13.320- 17:18.280* :  we end big trouble and asks what we can do to soften the impact for the future. We do have the
*17:18.280- 17:24.100* :  means to do something about this. Try and reduce our relative fossil fuels. Way more wind and
*17:24.100- 17:29.280* :  solar. I do have a lot of faith for the future. The climate question from the BBC World Service.
*17:29.280- 17:35.780* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*17:36.620- 17:41.260* :  Will they all won't they? That was a question hanging over the Spanish women's football team whose
*17:41.260- 17:46.140* :  players had refused to take part in international matches. This was partly in response to their
*17:46.140- 17:51.560* :  World Cup winning teammate Jenny Emoso being given an unwanted kiss on the lips by the football
*17:51.560- 17:58.500* :  federations then President Luis Rubiales. Now reforms have been promised and most of the players
*17:58.500- 18:04.000* :  have agreed to end their boycott. Victor Frankovs, the President of the National Sports Council,
*18:04.000- 18:10.860* :  welcomed the breakthrough. I think the good news we can share with people is that 21
*18:10.860- 18:16.360* :  players have showed their desire to remain. I have to be honest, the players are experiencing a
*18:16.360- 18:22.340* :  complicated moment, not less so than everyone else in this negotiation. And I think it's good
*18:22.340- 18:28.560* :  news to be able to say, this Spanish women's team will play with guarantees and hopefully victories
*18:28.620- 18:35.480* :  these next two games. I also reported in Madrid, Guy Hegeco, what these promised reforms were.
*18:36.220- 18:41.980* :  We don't know exactly. We don't know the exact measures that the Spanish football federation will
*18:41.980- 18:47.840* :  take or that it has promised the players. What we do know is that they seem to have accepted these
*18:47.840- 18:53.680* :  measures and the federation has promised to take what it's called at deep and immediate initiatives.
*18:55.020- 19:00.760* :  And what we understand is that those could include personnel changes at the top of the federation.
*19:00.760- 19:06.100* :  There is a feeling that there are still people high up in the federation who are allies of
*19:06.320- 19:11.080* :  Luis Rubiales, the man who kissed Jenny and also on the lips triggering this whole crisis,
*19:11.080- 19:17.340* :  who are still in their places. And also the players wanted systemic change as well.
*19:17.340- 19:22.900* :  They want to change it to the way that the women's football is run. So what we've heard today is
*19:23.200- 19:30.020* :  Sports Minister Michele Ysetta said that he thinks that by Friday, that's the day when the
*19:30.040- 19:34.500* :  Spanish team is going to play against Sweden, there will be changes in place. So it could be that
*19:34.500- 19:41.280* :  we see some personnel changes at the very least. And one big issue is pay. Yes, that's right. There
*19:41.280- 19:47.720* :  has been a lot of dispute over pay for women footballers and there has actually been a strike
*19:48.060- 19:53.380* :  in the separate, but the strike in the women's league, there was a strike going on for club
*19:53.380- 19:59.300* :  players as well. But the feeling seems to be that a major issue is the way that Spanish football
*19:59.300- 20:04.880* :  is run for women and that there are long standing issues and whether it's sort of direct
*20:04.880- 20:12.560* :  treatment by certain individuals or the more broader issues of how women's football is handled.
*20:12.560- 20:17.560* :  And you have to take into account that this is a World Cup winning team now. So in a sense,
*20:17.560- 20:22.200* :  they do have a much stronger hand to play. So when they go on strike, people are going to sit
*20:22.200- 20:27.700* :  up and notice and that is what has happened. We had this tremendous stalemate which looked
*20:27.700- 20:32.380* :  like it might stretch out and cause severe problems for Spanish football and that has finally come
*20:32.380- 20:38.840* :  to an end, it seems. Guy Hedgeko in Spain. Now, it's that time of year when students are starting
*20:38.840- 20:44.080* :  to head back to university. But just how far would you travel for your academic pursuits?
*20:44.580- 20:50.100* :  Well, one student from Guinea in West Africa made it his goal to study at a prestigious
*20:50.100- 20:56.920* :  institution in Egypt but didn't have the money to get there. So he decided on a less conventional
*20:56.920- 21:01.100* :  mode of transport for such a long journey. Yusuf Taha reports.
*21:16.000- 21:21.640* :  Mr. Barry ended up in chat. There, good Samaritan's paid for him to fly the rest of the way to Cairo.
*21:22.280- 21:25.700* :  His story earned him a meeting with the dean of the Faculty of Islamic Studies.
*21:26.480- 21:31.380* :  Dr. Nahla Saddi praised him for his determination and offered him a place on the faculty's
*21:31.380- 21:37.120* :  Islamic Studies course with a full scholarship along with a set of books to help him learn Arabic.
*21:37.880- 21:43.200* :  Mr. Barry said he's overjoyed to be studying at the prestigious university which made his journey
*21:43.200- 21:49.140* :  worse while. He pointed out that people in Guinea look up to Al-Azhar at the highest authority
*21:49.140- 21:54.880* :  of Sunni Islam and are always proud when their children graduate from one of its faculties.
*21:55.500- 22:00.960* :  Dr. Saidi, who's also the advisor for expatriate students, said that Al-Azhar offers its courses
*22:00.960- 22:07.020* :  and unlimited support to its students, including foreign ones, and tries to make their life easier.
*22:07.720- 22:12.640* :  Mr. Barry extended his thanks to the grand Imam of Al-Azhar to Egypt and its people
*22:13.100- 22:15.260* :  who welcomed him with open arms.
*22:15.580- 22:21.500* :  Yusuf Taha, just a couple of years ago, Britain was championing itself as a global leader
*22:21.500- 22:26.880* :  in battling climate change as it hosted a summit in which it tried to rally countries to do more
*22:26.880- 22:32.960* :  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But now the British Prime Minister has confirmed that there
*22:32.960- 22:37.760* :  is going to be a significant change in the government's net zero policies.
*22:38.600- 22:43.100* :  As we record this podcast, he's due to make an announcement in the next couple of hours.
*22:43.900- 22:49.440* :  This comes after the BBC revealed on Tuesday that Mr. Sunak was considering watering down some
*22:49.440- 22:55.240* :  of his pledges, including delaying the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.
*22:56.060- 23:01.000* :  Several big car makers, including Ford, which have invested heavily in producing electric
*23:01.000- 23:06.500* :  vehicles, warned that any delay would damage businesses and confuse buyers.
*23:07.180- 23:11.180* :  But the interior minister, Sir Ella Braverman, insists that this is not the case.
*23:11.860- 23:15.960* :  Fundamentally, we're not going to save the planet by bankrupting the British people.
*23:16.480- 23:22.120* :  The costs of achieving some of these arbitrary targets has to be taken into account.
*23:22.760- 23:28.360* :  These goals are just that goal, not straight jackets, and we need to ensure that we do it,
*23:28.720- 23:33.480* :  and we work towards those goals in a sustainable way, in a mature way, in a pragmatic way.
*23:34.280- 23:39.180* :  I asked a political correspondent, Rob Watson, what exactly Mr. Sunak might be planning?
*23:39.900- 23:44.440* :  I think in broad terms, what he's been considering, as you suggested, as a watering down
*23:44.940- 23:49.280* :  of anti climate change policies, such as, for example, one would be the last moment you could
*23:49.280- 23:52.420* :  buy a petrol car. And what's what it's about? Do we think?
*23:53.160- 23:57.880* :  It's two things. So he would argue that this is the slogan is, you know, you don't save the planet
*23:57.880- 24:02.160* :  by bankrupting the British economy. But I don't think there's any doubt that the second thing is
*24:02.160- 24:07.400* :  that this is just intensely political. And the view at Westminster is this is a sort of pretty
*24:07.400- 24:12.880* :  desperate piece of action. By a prime minister and a party, a very long way behind in the
*24:12.880- 24:18.040* :  opinion polls, essentially looking for one of those classic dividing lines in politics, which we
*24:18.040- 24:22.860* :  see all over the Western world and the sort of dividing line. He's looking at as this idea that,
*24:22.860- 24:28.880* :  you know, he would be on the side of ordinary motorists and homeowners against, sort of unreasonable,
*24:28.880- 24:33.820* :  unrealistic climate zealots. And I think probably one of the things that sparked this,
*24:33.820- 24:37.860* :  if people listening, remembers the bilection in West London, where the conservatives
*24:38.520- 24:44.020* :  held on in part because of that opposition to the extension of a lower mission zone there
*24:44.020- 24:49.420* :  in that part of London. This is at a time when the government is really struggling to win
*24:49.420- 24:55.300* :  popular support. It's got very low ratings in the opinion polls. But there is a danger that
*24:55.560- 25:01.340* :  this could backfire because many people in Britain, as elsewhere, are extremely concerned about
*25:01.340- 25:07.200* :  climate change, including with the Mr. Sunack's own party. You have hit the proverbial nail on the
*25:07.280- 25:12.260* :  hedge and at. I mean, there are plenty of conservative party activists and MPs who are going to
*25:12.780- 25:18.600* :  welcome this. But the danger is that this is one of those blatantly, I mean, absolutely blatantly
*25:18.600- 25:25.700* :  populist policies that could prove fantastically, even catastrophically, unpopular because polling
*25:25.700- 25:30.840* :  does suggest that, yes, while people are a bit nervous about the price tag attached to some
*25:30.840- 25:36.220* :  climate change policies, people really do care. Many of them passionately about what they see going
*25:36.220- 25:41.660* :  on in Britain and around the world's lab climate. So it is an intensely, an intensely risky and
*25:41.660- 25:48.020* :  very political move. Rob Watson. Now, as London Fashion Week was being held this week, the Human
*25:48.020- 25:53.680* :  Rights Foundation used the occasion to project images on iconic landmarks across the city,
*25:53.680- 26:00.240* :  such as Tower Bridge and the Tape Modern Art Gallery, urging onlookers to consider the lives
*26:00.240- 26:06.620* :  behind their clothes. It says, one in five cotton garments worldwide are linked to the forced
*26:06.620- 26:12.340* :  labour of China's Wiga people, who are believed to be held against their will in what the state calls
*26:12.340- 26:18.000* :  re-education camps. Claudia Bennett of the Human Rights Foundation talked about the projected
*26:18.000- 26:24.700* :  images to my colleague, Victoria Uonkwanda. You're seeing actual portraits of those detained
*26:24.700- 26:30.380* :  in the camps smuggled out by a whistle blower and then sent to an NGO actually in Washington,
*26:30.380- 26:36.700* :  DC. And then you also see big bold letters of the human rights violations that are taking place
*26:36.700- 26:43.860* :  such as forced sterilization, mass surveillance, inhumane treatment torture, and also this receipt
*26:43.860- 26:51.260* :  that tells you that a £4.99 t-shirt, while it is discounted to £4.99 compared to £44.99,
*26:51.340- 26:57.020* :  what you are saving is the human rights violations and the discounts are people's lives.
*26:57.440- 27:02.280* :  And how should I then can people be that the images that they're seeing are the people who
*27:02.280- 27:08.320* :  are said to be picking the cotton in our clothes? Since 2017, the CCP has arbitrarily
*27:08.320- 27:13.000* :  detained more than one million Wigas in the concentration camps. And we know that they are forced
*27:13.000- 27:18.220* :  to work there, including picking cotton or making clothes that then end up in stores all over the
*27:18.220- 27:23.500* :  world. And democracies worldwide have called what is taking place in China a genocide,
*27:23.500- 27:29.320* :  and the fashion industry is complicit in this. So the CCP that you mentioned there is the Chinese
*27:29.320- 27:35.360* :  Communist Party. But then do we know that all the cotton that is being used in the fashion,
*27:35.360- 27:40.320* :  the clothes that we wear is coming from that area? Well, according to the coalition to
*27:40.320- 27:45.900* :  Enforce Labour in the Wigar region, one in five cotton garments worldwide is linked to Wigaforce
*27:45.900- 27:51.660* :  Labour. So there is a huge possibility that anything that you are wearing, I am wearing,
*27:51.660- 27:55.240* :  the person down the street is wearing, and especially those on the runways during fashion
*27:55.240- 28:01.120* :  wearing, is linked to Wigaforce Labour. So you said that we needed to have more transparency
*28:01.120- 28:06.120* :  from the brands in the clothes that we wear. But how can we be sure that we are taking those
*28:06.120- 28:12.220* :  kind of steps to make sure that what we are wearing is ethically sourced? We at the Human Rights
*28:12.220- 28:16.800* :  Foundation have an award winning Google Chrome extension, which is called the Wigaforce Labour
*28:16.800- 28:23.640* :  Checker. And when you go to a website through that checker, it notifies you when you visit the website
*28:23.640- 28:28.580* :  of a brand that is likely linked to Wigaforce Labour, and it prompts you to reconsider your purchase.
*28:29.340- 28:34.240* :  And the bottom line really is that everyone can and should play a part in ending Wigaforce Labour.
*28:34.800- 28:39.640* :  It is as simple as demanding your favourite brands disclose not only where their products are made,
*28:39.640- 28:43.980* :  but who is making them. Claudia Bennett of the Human Rights Foundation,
*28:43.980- 28:48.840* :  the Chinese Communist Party has yet to comment on the specific claims made in this interview,
*28:49.360- 28:53.380* :  but has previously denied that it's mistreating its Wigaforce population.
*28:54.500- 28:59.320* :  Now, it's not often that performers get to hit back at critics who belittle their appearance,
*28:59.440- 29:05.500* :  but one actress had a light-hearted but effective response to an opera critic who said her
*29:05.500- 29:12.520* :  makeup made her look like a fright. 81-year-old Rose Knox Peoples was performing in Vagmars-Dustmine
*29:12.520- 29:18.500* :  Gold here in London. Stephanie Prentice reports on how she cut her critic down to size.
*29:25.780- 29:30.680* :  The trailer for Dad's Reign Golds at the Royal Opera House in London shows the main characters
*29:31.020- 29:36.380* :  seated around a table, promising a tale of love, power and deception.
*29:38.360- 29:44.200* :  Among them a naked Rose Knox Peoples playing Erda the Earth Goddess. Her portrayals
*29:44.200- 29:50.260* :  being celebrated by critics with the Times newspaper calling her extraordinary, but one critic
*29:50.260- 29:56.340* :  reviewing the depiction of the first opera in Vagmars- celebrated ring cycle found her appearance
*29:56.340- 30:02.100* :  somewhat distracting. In his review for the Financial Times, he said Erda's makeup looked,
*30:02.100- 30:08.360* :  in his words, quite a fright, adding that probably goes with the territory if you've been around
*30:08.360- 30:14.320* :  since the dawn of time. This prompted the actress to write a letter to the paper,
*30:14.800- 30:20.640* :  politely explaining that actually she wasn't wearing any makeup. Adding the fright look is all
*30:20.640- 30:27.160* :  naturally mine. It's not the first time that journalists have been criticised for focusing on
*30:27.160- 30:34.000* :  the appearance of female opera performers. In 2014 Tara Erot was described as dumpy,
*30:34.000- 30:40.400* :  unsightly and unappealing, following her performance in Doe Rosing Cavalier. At the time,
*30:40.400- 30:45.840* :  singers and other journalists rushed to her defence, saying that opera should be about the singing.
*30:47.200- 30:48.740* :  That was Stephanie Prentice.
*30:51.440- 30:55.920* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
