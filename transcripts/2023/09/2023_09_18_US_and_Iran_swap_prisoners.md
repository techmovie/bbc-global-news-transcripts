*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service, with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.900- 00:23.620* :  In late 2007, the remains of a young woman from the caska nation were discovered in the Yukon woods.
*00:24.560- 00:27.600* :  I always think about, I want to know what really happened.
*00:28.600- 00:33.840* :  So I travel north to try to understand what happened and who was involved.
*00:34.440- 00:37.700* :  It's a pretty big risk to come forward with the information that I have.
*00:38.460- 00:45.020* :  I'm David Ritten and this is someone knows something season 8, the Angel Carlet case, available now.
*00:49.040- 00:52.260* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:55.180- 01:00.340* :  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 18th of September, these are our main stories.
*01:01.040- 01:05.860* :  Five American prisoners who've been detained for years in Iran are now flying home as part of
*01:05.860- 01:11.360* :  a complex exchange deal mediated by Qatar. Russia tries to get a case brought against it by
*01:11.360- 01:17.140* :  Ukraine thrown out of the international court of justice. A lawsuit accuses the Australian government
*01:17.140- 01:20.960* :  of failing to protect the Great Barrier Reef from climate change.
*01:24.080- 01:29.440* :  Also in this podcast, the man known as the grandfather of Russian rock music has this message
*01:29.820- 01:32.020* :  for his fellow citizens about Ukraine.
*01:32.860- 01:39.280* :  I know the paranoid condition they're in. I know I spend most of my life under this condition,
*01:39.360- 01:42.460* :  so only now it's like deadly.
*01:49.140- 01:55.060* :  As we record this podcast, a plane has taken off from Iran, flying five Americans to freedom.
*01:55.660- 02:01.160* :  The Jewel Nationals, four men and a woman had been imprisoned in Iran for years,
*02:01.740- 02:07.880* :  but after months of painstaking negotiations mediated by Qatar, they've now been released as part
*02:07.880- 02:14.480* :  of a complex prison swap. Six billion dollars of Iranian oil money, which had been frozen by
*02:14.480- 02:21.960* :  sanctions, were first sent to banks in Doha, and five Iranians held in US jails are also being
*02:21.960- 02:27.960* :  released. The deal has been criticised by both Iranian activists and leading US Republicans.
*02:28.060- 02:34.880* :  They say will only encourage more hostage-taking. Washington says it's keeping pressure on Iran
*02:35.360- 02:39.980* :  by imposing new sanctions on Iranian officials, including the former president,
*02:39.980- 02:45.000* :  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for their involvement in the detention of American citizens.
*02:45.720- 02:51.240* :  Our chief international correspondent, Lee DuSet, is in Doha. She's been speaking to my colleague,
*02:51.240- 02:57.020* :  Tim Franks. There's a growing sense of anticipation here at the lounge at Doha's
*02:57.440- 03:01.460* :  old international airport. There's been a growing hubbub over the last few hours.
*03:01.880- 03:07.120* :  American diplomats are said to be here, Qatar officials. I've also spotted Iranian diplomats
*03:07.120- 03:14.700* :  arriving here at this terminal, and we're expecting that the plane, which has left Iran, will be landing
*03:14.700- 03:23.340* :  here. The first stop on finally their journey home by five American prisoners, described by the
*03:23.340- 03:30.200* :  U.S. as wrongfully detained, but widely regarded as hostages. We know the identities of at least
*03:30.200- 03:36.200* :  three of them, Siamakh Namazi, who spent nearly eight years in Iran's notorious Evan prison,
*03:36.200- 03:43.220* :  Ahmad Shargi, another business person, and Murad Taba, 67 years old, who holds British nationality
*03:43.220- 03:48.760* :  as well. He's one of the environmentalists who'd been detained by Iran. He was expected to go home
*03:48.760- 03:55.580* :  last year to Britain, but he had been left behind there. We've also heard the two of the Iranians
*03:55.580- 04:03.420* :  released from American prisons as part of this deal have now landed in Doha, so it is unfolding.
*04:04.120- 04:09.080* :  To get a better sense of the complexities of this controversial, but indeed very
*04:09.080- 04:14.600* :  compassionate, and deal to end this personal ordeal, painful ordeal for the prisoners,
*04:14.620- 04:20.360* :  I've been speaking to Mehran Kamarava. He's a professor of governance here at Georgetown
*04:20.360- 04:27.540* :  University in Doha. I asked him, how would he describe this deal? It's yet another episode in this
*04:27.540- 04:33.000* :  long and tortured relationship between Iran and the United States. The money, of course,
*04:33.000- 04:40.400* :  rightly belongs to Iran. It is a result of Iranian oil sales to South Korea, and of course,
*04:40.400- 04:46.420* :  it used to be $7 billion. Now it's somehow been reduced to $6 billion, but it is a step in the
*04:46.420- 04:52.560* :  right direction in terms of the release of the prisoners, and also some funds being injected
*04:52.560- 04:58.180* :  into the Iranian economy and therefore helping the Iranian middle classes. As you know, there's been
*04:58.180- 05:04.980* :  a lot of criticism of the deal. It's being said that this is money that Iran will use for other
*05:04.980- 05:12.540* :  purposes. What do you say to the critics? Well, I am aware of the criticism, but the money is
*05:12.540- 05:19.740* :  going to either directly or indirectly help the Iranian economy and therefore the salaried
*05:19.740- 05:25.500* :  middle classes, the lower middle classes, those people who are the real victims of the sanctions.
*05:25.760- 05:31.380* :  The government, the political elite is still there. In fact, because of the sanctions, because of
*05:31.380- 05:37.500* :  maximum pressure, both under Trump and now under Biden, the government has become
*05:37.500- 05:44.420* :  more hard line, and the middle classes continue to suffer. The government's policies haven't changed,
*05:45.000- 05:51.360* :  regime change hasn't occurred, and it's really the average Iranian who's bearing the brunt
*05:51.400- 05:57.020* :  of the sanctions. Iran has been doing it for decades, take dual nationals effectively hostage.
*05:57.180- 06:01.260* :  Is this really one of the diplomacy of choice for the Iranian regime?
*06:01.540- 06:09.160* :  This is a diplomacy of desperation. It's a diplomacy that Iran has to resort to in order to put pressure
*06:09.160- 06:16.260* :  on the United States. There are very few levers that Iran has on the US, the UK, and the European
*06:16.260- 06:23.860* :  Union. One is the nuclear file, enrichment in particular, and the other is taking dual nationals
*06:23.860- 06:27.920* :  as prisoners. But do you fear that there will be more taken prisoner taken hostage?
*06:28.400- 06:33.920* :  I wouldn't be surprised, yes, if there are in the future, if there are more prisoners
*06:33.920- 06:40.040* :  that who are taken hostage. That is a constant fear for all of us, millions of Iranians who live
*06:40.040- 06:46.200* :  outside the country, who love the country, who have deep roots in the country, want to go back.
*06:46.660- 06:51.960* :  Every time I go back, my batteries get charged. I feel at ease with myself,
*06:52.740- 06:58.700* :  but unfortunately, folks like me and millions of others like me take a huge risk going to Iran.
*06:59.640- 07:04.840* :  Merang Kamrava of Georgetown University Qatar ending that report by Lee's dissent.
*07:05.780- 07:10.100* :  Russia and Ukraine are facing each other today, not on the battlefield, but in court.
*07:10.460- 07:15.340* :  The case in the Hague was brought to the International Court of Justice by Ukraine just days after
*07:15.340- 07:21.220* :  Russia's invasion last year. Kiev argued that Moscow falsely abused international law
*07:21.560- 07:25.720* :  by saying its invasion was necessary to prevent a genocide in Ukraine.
*07:26.620- 07:31.460* :  Today, the Kremlin is trying to get the case thrown out, arguing that it falls outside the
*07:31.460- 07:36.100* :  remit of the UN court. Our reporter in the Hague, Anna Holligan, told us more.
*07:36.580- 07:41.300* :  These hearings represent a pivotal moment in the grand scheme of things because
*07:42.000- 07:46.400* :  it's a decision over jurisdiction, but it will determine whether or not this case actually
*07:46.400- 07:51.500* :  continues. The judges have to decide whether the International Court of Justice, the UN's highest
*07:51.500- 07:56.180* :  court, has a legal mandate to deal with the merits, so the meat of this lawsuit.
*07:57.280- 08:02.520* :  Today, lawyers representing Russia are trying to get the entire thing thrown out by arguing
*08:02.520- 08:08.020* :  that the ICJ doesn't have jurisdiction because it says under the genocide convention,
*08:08.020- 08:12.200* :  which is a convention under which Ukraine brought this case to the ICJ,
*08:13.720- 08:20.240* :  there is no ground to cover the use of force between states. So that is essentially Russia's argument
*08:20.240- 08:25.740* :  today. And how long are we expecting this to go on for? Well, so Russia speaks today. Tomorrow
*08:25.740- 08:32.460* :  Ukraine, interestingly on Wednesday, we will hear from the 32 states intervening. So 32 other
*08:32.460- 08:38.600* :  countries have intervened on Ukraine's side, arguing this case should go ahead and that the ICJ
*08:38.600- 08:43.560* :  is the right place to hear the merits of this case. And the merits of this case, as you mentioned,
*08:43.560- 08:49.500* :  Kiev accused Moscow of distorting reality by using it said, baseless claims of a genocide in
*08:49.500- 08:54.380* :  eastern Ukraine as a pretext for launching a full-blown invasion. So it was just a couple of days
*08:54.380- 08:59.460* :  after Russian tanks rolled across the border that Ukraine brought this case to the ICJ. And we've
*08:59.460- 09:08.540* :  already had an interim ruling. So in March 2022, the judges called on Russia to cease all hostilities
*09:08.540- 09:15.380* :  overt and covert, and for both sides to avoiding anything that could escalate the tensions even
*09:15.380- 09:22.320* :  further, but as we have seen since, Russia ignored that ruling. And the issue with this court
*09:22.320- 09:27.560* :  really, the challenge is that it doesn't have any powers of enforcement. So although the rulings
*09:27.660- 09:31.900* :  are legally binding, and legally binding on Russia too, because Russia and Ukraine have both
*09:31.900- 09:37.200* :  signed the genocide convention, but there are no powers of enforcement. So if it goes ahead,
*09:37.200- 09:43.160* :  Russia could ignore it, but it could still help victims with any future reparations, claims,
*09:43.160- 09:49.140* :  if Russia uses this case in its entirety. So that's if the court was to roll against Russia,
*09:49.140- 09:54.240* :  so that would be the difference it could make, even if Moscow ignored it. Exactly, exactly. Yes,
*09:54.240- 10:00.020* :  and also with these cases, international justice cases, they set precedent. So there are a
*10:00.020- 10:04.660* :  number of other cases against President Putin, also against Russia being heard here in the Hague,
*10:04.660- 10:08.800* :  so any decision in this case that the ICJ could influence others too.
*10:09.680- 10:14.540* :  Anna Holligan. Environmental activists have launched a lawsuit against the Australian Government
*10:14.540- 10:19.780* :  accusing it of failing to protect the Great Barrier Reef from the effects of coal mining on
*10:19.780- 10:25.580* :  climate change. Phil Mercer reports. Campaigners insist the Environment Minister has a legal
*10:25.580- 10:32.240* :  responsibility to prevent new coal and gas projects, damaging Australia's ecological gems,
*10:32.240- 10:38.280* :  including the Great Barrier Reef. It's facing many threats such as warmer ocean temperatures
*10:39.060- 10:45.380* :  that have led to widespread coral bleaching. Activists are taking their case to the federal courts.
*10:46.180- 10:51.300* :  They want all mining projects in Australia to be properly assessed for their potential
*10:51.300- 10:57.280* :  impact on climate change. The government says it has ambitious environmental policies
*10:57.980- 11:02.840* :  and recently refused to approve a new coal mine to protect the barrier reef.
*11:03.760- 11:09.980* :  Phil Mercer. An notorious anti-migrant campaign group in South Africa has registered as a political
*11:09.980- 11:16.220* :  party ahead of next year's general election. Operation Dudula, which means Operation Force
*11:16.220- 11:22.320* :  Out in Zulu, is promising to take its campaign against undocumented foreign nationals to the
*11:22.320- 11:27.780* :  country's parliament. BBC Africa Eyes Ayanda Charlie reports from Johannesburg.
*11:31.180- 11:36.000* :  These men are riding in the back of a pickup truck in South Africa's Soweto Township.
*11:36.880- 11:42.720* :  They are on a mission to confront a local shopkeeper who is in dispute with his landlady
*11:51.500- 11:56.280* :  over rent. Let's start with the documents that allow you to work in this country.
*11:57.480- 12:03.100* :  They say they're here to engage with him, but within minutes the situation turns ugly.
*12:05.080- 12:09.860* :  If you are disrespectful to us, we will beat you up. I have a whip right there. Don't think
*12:09.860- 12:15.540* :  that we're afraid of you. Without papers to prove his residency, the shopkeeper from Mozambique
*12:15.540- 12:22.560* :  is forced out of his business. I operation Dudula, an anti-migrant campaign group and newly formed
*12:22.560- 12:28.660* :  political party. BBC Africa Eye has been filming with them for the past two weeks.
*12:28.660- 12:36.340* :  What gives you the right for them? I'm a citizen. I'm legally a citizen. I have my license.
*12:36.400- 12:40.620* :  I have my idea. I have everything. You're not vigilant.
*12:41.560- 12:45.580* :  They say they want all undocumented migrants to leave South Africa.
*12:46.500- 12:53.420* :  We grew up in an apartment time where things were much better than what it is now. The law was
*12:54.760- 13:00.940* :  the law. But now the things are happening. The government is feeling us in law.
*13:01.700- 13:06.820* :  But critics accused Dudula of xenophobia and vigilantes him.
*13:10.660- 13:16.480* :  I'm at a market in the centre of Johannesburg. Any Michaels helps to support the traders here
*13:16.840- 13:20.560* :  who are mostly migrants. The migrants, they are the poorest of the poor,
*13:21.020- 13:26.140* :  and they are vulnerable. They'd rather go to them and retell them instead of retelling the
*13:26.140- 13:39.260* :  cages of the guys living in the class houses. Hundreds gathered in central Johannesburg
*13:39.260- 13:43.560* :  for operation to Dudula's conference. The mood is celebratory.
*13:43.660- 13:52.040* :  But listen to some of the words. This man is singing, we will go to the gas station,
*13:52.060- 13:59.620* :  buy some petrol, and burn the foreigners. At the conference, members vote overwhelmingly in
*13:59.620- 14:06.300* :  favour of becoming a political party. Zandile Dabula is the president and hopes to lead the party
*14:06.300- 14:13.340* :  in next year's general election. You've managed to gain a following on the singular message
*14:13.420- 14:20.760* :  that foreigners must go. Is that not running on hate? We must be realistic here that most of the
*14:20.760- 14:26.960* :  problems that we have are caused by the influx of foreign nationals. We were at an operation yesterday.
*14:27.500- 14:32.140* :  What was supposed to be a conversation very quickly turned into a confrontation. In some instances,
*14:32.140- 14:38.400* :  you need to really be harsh. We don't promote violence and we don't want people to feel harassed,
*14:38.460- 14:42.400* :  but I'll tell you that at some stage, we really need to push harder.
*14:44.220- 14:49.920* :  The ruling A&C party has been in government for almost 30 years, but against the backdrop of a
*14:49.920- 14:56.420* :  failing economy rampant criminality and widespread corruption, polls show that support for the party
*14:56.420- 15:01.380* :  has been declining. Operation Dudula is hoping to fill that vacuum.
*15:04.080- 15:08.460* :  I end up Charlie reporting, and if you want to hear more on that story, you can find the full
*15:08.460- 15:14.940* :  film on the BBC News Africa YouTube page just search for fear and loathing in South Africa.
*15:18.140- 15:22.560* :  Still to come in this podcast, the case for big businesses to help preserve nature.
*15:23.000- 15:28.380* :  Think through the loss of biodiversity, think through water shortages or water stress,
*15:28.760- 15:35.460* :  and how all of those issues manifest, let's say, in a drinks company or on a farm that is farming
*15:35.460- 15:36.360* :  degraded land.
*15:46.560- 15:53.280* :  In late 2007, the remains of a young woman from the caska nation were discovered in the Yukon woods.
*15:54.200- 15:57.240* :  I always think about I want to know what really happened.
*15:58.240- 16:03.440* :  So I travel north to try to understand what happened and who was involved.
*16:04.100- 16:07.320* :  It's a pretty big risk to come forward with the information that I have.
*16:08.100- 16:14.660* :  I'm David Ritten and this is someone knows something season 8, the Angel Carlet case, available now.
*16:19.620- 16:24.960* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Elite Women's Tennis has returned to China for the
*16:24.960- 16:30.540* :  first time in more than three years after the Women's Tennis Association ended its boycott
*16:30.920- 16:36.520* :  over concerns about the tennis star Pung Shui. Events were first cancelled because of the pandemic,
*16:36.520- 16:42.740* :  but then in 2021, the WTA suspended its tournaments in China after the tennis player
*16:42.740- 16:48.340* :  accused a top government official of sexual assault. She then disappeared from public view
*16:48.340- 16:54.040* :  for several weeks, sparking an outcry amid fears over her safety. When she re-emerged,
*16:54.040- 16:59.440* :  she denied making the allegation. At the time, the WTA's chief executive, Steve Smith,
*16:59.440- 17:04.920* :  said no tournaments would be staged in China until Pung Shui's claims were investigated.
*17:05.600- 17:10.740* :  We're not going to walk away from this and we're not going to allow this to be swept away
*17:11.920- 17:17.880* :  without the appropriate respect and seriousness of the allegations that have been reflected or
*17:17.880- 17:23.060* :  appropriately addressed. Well, today, a WTA tournament got underway in the southern
*17:23.060- 17:28.620* :  Chinese city of Guangzhou. So what's happened to bring about this U-turn? Asia-Pacific editor
*17:28.620- 17:36.780* :  is Mickey Bristol. Essentially what the WTA said was that they were simply not going to get
*17:36.780- 17:41.480* :  their demands met. Their demand was for there to be a thorough investigation independent
*17:41.480- 17:47.380* :  into the investigation into the allegations made by Pung Shui. They decided they weren't going
*17:47.380- 17:52.500* :  to get that investigation. I think correctly because China has always tried to simply ignore
*17:52.500- 17:56.820* :  these allegations. It was never going to hold an investigation. There's no independent body
*17:57.360- 18:03.540* :  in China anywhere to hold an investigation. So a WTA was faced with a decision to either continue
*18:04.060- 18:10.140* :  indefinitely for ever, perhaps, or go back and they decided that they would go back to China.
*18:10.600- 18:18.600* :  Partly, they said because it was damaging fans and tennis players in China that the
*18:18.600- 18:24.160* :  continuation of this ban. Because WTA tournaments in China are extremely lucrative.
*18:25.360- 18:29.560* :  They are and that's that's another reason that people said that they were going back on what
*18:29.560- 18:35.640* :  they said earlier. The WTA, that is, it's simply money. Before the pandemic, I think 10 out of
*18:35.640- 18:41.400* :  60 tournaments taking place around the world were in China. Remember China was the second biggest
*18:41.400- 18:46.340* :  economy in the world, looking to integrate itself into the sporting world, all kinds of sports.
*18:46.340- 18:53.000* :  So obviously the China circuit was very lucrative and many people said, okay, you just went back
*18:53.000- 19:00.480* :  for the money and that is something which is an accusation hard for the WTA to deny. I mean,
*19:00.480- 19:07.400* :  if you just look, there are a series of tournaments taking place over the next few weeks in China,
*19:07.400- 19:12.980* :  one at the end of the month in Beijing, has got a prize money of $8 million. So you can just see
*19:12.980- 19:17.160* :  there's a lot of money at stake. And what do we know about Pung Shui herself?
*19:18.520- 19:23.540* :  Very little, really. I mean, she after making the allegations, she took that down or that was
*19:23.540- 19:29.080* :  taken down. It was on social media. She then came out and said on a number of different places
*19:29.080- 19:34.860* :  and in a number of different interviews that she went back on what she said. She didn't really mean
*19:34.860- 19:39.920* :  what she said. But nothing has really been heard about her saying she said she just wanted to spend
*19:39.920- 19:46.120* :  time with her family and we presume that's what she's doing. But in China, there's no way to
*19:46.120- 19:53.020* :  independently verify her conditions, her situation, no independent authority to check on her
*19:53.440- 19:59.620* :  and really check on the allegations actually made. So really, we don't know what condition she's in.
*19:59.940- 20:03.280* :  We don't know any more really than we did two years ago.
*20:03.760- 20:09.020* :  I Asia Pacific editor Mickey Bristol. The UN General Assembly is holding its annual climate
*20:09.020- 20:15.220* :  week in New York and at the city's Stock Exchange, a task force backed by the UN is unveiling a new
*20:15.220- 20:20.560* :  framework to help big businesses understand and mitigate the effects their work has on the
*20:20.560- 20:26.980* :  natural environment from animal habitats to soil health. Dr Nina Seger of Cambridge University
*20:26.980- 20:33.140* :  is an advisor to this task force on nature-related financial disclosures. She told my colleague,
*20:33.140- 20:39.700* :  Michelle Hussain, well this is all about 40 members of finance and business community have come
*20:39.700- 20:47.740* :  together and created a framework to allow organizations both businesses and financial firms to think
*20:47.740- 20:55.760* :  about their risks of nature-related financial risks but also the impacts that they have on nature.
*20:56.120- 21:03.480* :  Effectively, we know that nature loss is a major issue today. We are in a nature crisis
*21:03.960- 21:11.420* :  and this task force has been convened two years ago to think through how do we see the effects
*21:11.420- 21:17.840* :  of that nature loss within the business community and how can the business community work to
*21:17.840- 21:24.520* :  mitigate those effects? How is it different from the ESG environmental and sustainability metric
*21:24.520- 21:29.960* :  that already goes into company annual reports? So effectively a lot of the ESG metrics that
*21:29.960- 21:38.040* :  are currently looked at have to do with climate so as part of the environmental field what we need
*21:38.040- 21:44.300* :  to do as part of this task force and more generally is to think through the wider issues, think
*21:44.300- 21:49.660* :  through the loss of biodiversity that is driven by for example the loss of insects, the loss of
*21:49.660- 21:56.040* :  pollination, think through water shortages or water stress, think through land degradation and
*21:56.040- 22:02.840* :  how all of those issues manifest let's say in a drinks company or on a farm that is farming
*22:02.840- 22:11.100* :  degraded land and how all of those issues cause very material already existing financial risks
*22:11.100- 22:17.600* :  into those companies as well as how are all of those companies impacting nature around them.
*22:17.780- 22:22.880* :  Do you therefore want companies to think in terms of their nature footprint as well as their
*22:22.880- 22:28.860* :  carbon footprint? Absolutely and what's really really key is that this framework doesn't only look
*22:28.860- 22:35.460* :  at the risk element, it looks at the impact on the footprint element so that we can all work
*22:35.460- 22:42.740* :  together to mitigate that footprint from the get go. Or to offset it because offsetting is not
*22:42.740- 22:49.320* :  something that everyone's in favour of that essentially displaces a form of activity but
*22:49.960- 22:55.360* :  are you saying if a company for example puts up a factory it is almost certainly going to
*22:55.360- 23:01.140* :  displace wildlife depending on where it goes but all of these kinds of things could come into it.
*23:01.620- 23:08.360* :  What is your answer to that? So offsetting should be in general used as a very last case
*23:08.740- 23:15.640* :  resort. I think so if you think about a farm that potentially can be farming degraded land.
*23:16.480- 23:22.460* :  It has reduced productivity and therefore it's actually it's not only that it is impacts nature
*23:22.460- 23:28.620* :  around it but it is bad for its profits, it's bad for its business. So if it starts bringing
*23:28.620- 23:34.900* :  in measure to improve the the soils to make the soils more healthy not only does it start
*23:34.900- 23:39.240* :  improving the nature around it but it also improves its profitability.
*23:42.320- 23:47.460* :  The Gold Coast is one of Australia's most popular surfing destinations not just for humans
*23:47.460- 23:52.960* :  it appears but animals as well. Surfing dogs have been spotted on the beaches before
*23:53.580- 23:59.600* :  but it's a video of a man surfing with his pet python that's been getting people's attention
*23:59.600- 24:05.080* :  recently. Unfortunately for the owner it also caught the attention of wildlife protection
*24:05.120- 24:07.860* :  officers. Shantar Huffle has the story.
*24:12.200- 24:19.060* :  The video set to this music shows Igor Fyosa standing on his board riding huge waves at Rainbow Bay
*24:19.540- 24:25.200* :  with his three year old snake Shiva wrapped around his neck. In another shot the snake is resting
*24:25.200- 24:31.480* :  on the board with Igor paddling his legs in the water. He describes Shiva as a natural and says
*24:31.480- 24:36.980* :  she's been surfing at least ten times before. Usually when she doesn't like something she starts
*24:36.980- 24:43.420* :  hissing but she doesn't hiss in the water she's always chill he said. It seems that was Shiva's
*24:43.680- 24:48.280* :  last ocean outing though. After seeing the video which featured in Australian media
*24:48.880- 24:54.040* :  Queensland wildlife officials were concerned for the python's well-being and the safety of the
*24:54.040- 25:00.160* :  public. They said taking native pets out in public could cause them unnecessary stress and could
*25:00.160- 25:05.500* :  make them behave in an unpredictable way. They've now fined Mr Fyosa one and a half thousand
*25:05.500- 25:11.540* :  US dollars for breaching the conditions of owning his snake. Shiva isn't the first animal to
*25:11.540- 25:18.200* :  find fame for surfing at Rainbow Bay as well as several dogs a duck named Duck is a regular.
*25:19.180- 25:24.800* :  Truly it's not something we push we just had him come alone to the beach with us because that's
*25:24.800- 25:30.440* :  what we do as a family. We would get to wave and we just follow us and we realised it was fun
*25:30.760- 25:32.420* :  and so we wanted to do it too.
*25:36.000- 25:41.280* :  That report by Chantal Hartle. Solar panels are already a familiar sight around the world
*25:41.280- 25:47.020* :  from powering individual homes or businesses to huge arrays producing electricity for national
*25:47.020- 25:54.560* :  supplies but what a huge solar farms could be built in space generating power 24 hours a day
*25:54.560- 26:01.040* :  and beaming it back down to earth. The British astronaut Tim Peek told my colleague Nick Robinson
*26:01.040- 26:07.160* :  the idea was close to becoming affordable. Up there you've got permanent sunshine if you put your solar
*26:07.160- 26:11.780* :  farm in the right orbit. You can get more efficient panels because the sun's not going through the
*26:11.780- 26:16.220* :  earth's atmosphere so it's not being scattered and you can build very very lightweight structures that
*26:16.220- 26:21.660* :  don't have to withstand earth's gravity but of course it's always been very expensive to get there.
*26:21.840- 26:26.040* :  Now we're approaching the era where the cost of access to space is coming down though and so it
*26:26.040- 26:30.860* :  becomes viable. What's changed to make it affordable? One of the biggest changes has been steps in
*26:30.860- 26:36.060* :  rocket technology in particular companies like SpaceX. It used to cost about two and a half
*26:36.060- 26:40.840* :  thousand dollars on a fork and nine to get to space that's per kilogram and then the fork and
*26:40.840- 26:44.920* :  heavy bought it down to about fifteen hundred dollars and now with Starship Elon Musk's new
*26:44.920- 26:51.340* :  massive rocket we could see costs as low as a hundred dollars per kilogram. Now the European
*26:51.340- 26:56.980* :  Space Agency has done a study called Solaris which is looking at these solar farms and how viable
*26:56.980- 27:02.640* :  it might be and I've said that once we get to less than a thousand dollars per kilogram it becomes
*27:02.640- 27:08.100* :  economically viable so it's very exciting times ahead. Now you and I are of the age where we remember
*27:08.100- 27:12.600* :  the excitement we felt at the Apollo launches. Of course younger people were excited about your
*27:13.260- 27:17.400* :  launch into space. Do you think it continues to have that hold on people's imagination?
*27:17.940- 27:22.220* :  Oh completely I think it's growing even more so we're in this new era of space exploration.
*27:22.300- 27:28.100* :  Four of my friends are busy in training right now for Artemis 2 which will launch either late next
*27:28.100- 27:34.260* :  year or into 2025 going back to the moon a kind of Apollo 8 rerun in a different orbit but
*27:34.560- 27:39.520* :  it's going to be so exciting for new generations on Artemis 3 which will follow soon after
*27:39.520- 27:44.060* :  to actually watch humans once again on the surface of the moon. Astronaut Tim Peek
*27:44.800- 27:50.320* :  Boris Kurensikov has been called the Grandfather of Russian rock music a pioneer who
*27:50.320- 27:57.000* :  defied Soviet era censorship to release hugely popular underground albums beginning in the 1970s.
*27:57.620- 28:02.860* :  Kurensikov now lives in London and has been labelled a traitor by the Kremlin for opposing the
*28:02.860- 28:08.560* :  war in Ukraine. His latest project is a charity album called Hill the Sky to benefit a Ukrainian
*28:08.560- 28:14.440* :  children's hospital and it features songs from his many famous friends including Mariam Faithful,
*28:14.440- 28:20.680* :  Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics and Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac. He spoke to my colleague Victoria
*28:21.140- 28:21.780* :  Uwon Kunde.
*28:29.600- 28:37.400* :  The sole reason for doing this album, not even doing this album, asking people to donate a song
*28:38.620- 28:44.720* :  is because we always pay attention to the political side of the conflict.
*28:44.720- 28:56.600* :  The night is so bright you could look for a need of the moon, let with silvery light.
*28:58.680- 29:02.640* :  Can I help her to get a lot of friends in Ukraine because we played there
*29:03.780- 29:11.260* :  dozens and dozens and dozens of times. And I know that the people they kind of wonder why we are
*29:11.260- 29:18.040* :  being shot at. Why are we being shot? Have the world gone mad? Have the world forgotten about us
*29:18.100- 29:22.620* :  that we are human, we are alive. And that's what people write to it.
*29:23.040- 29:33.340* :  Until the morning, I'll carry your home, I will carry your home, my dear one.
*29:37.400- 29:45.760* :  And I thought that maybe if I could help get several dozen of songs, especially songs with nobody
*29:45.760- 29:51.980* :  have heard or written especially for this compilation, that would sort of remind the people that,
*29:51.980- 29:58.940* :  yes, we are not alone. You are not alone, we see you, we hear you, we think about you. Tell us
*29:58.940- 30:05.140* :  more about the artists that you got in touch with, that you brought on, that donated, as you say,
*30:05.140- 30:14.720* :  a song to the album. Well, I happen to have good connections or even friendship with some of
*30:14.720- 30:21.320* :  most brilliant writers and musicians of the generation. So, you know, I addressed
*30:21.420- 30:28.640* :  by old friend Dave Stewart and he immediately came back with a new song that we finished together.
*30:47.760- 30:54.480* :  And I also drafted a Ukrainian friend of mine, very popular. And then people like Ian Anderson
*30:54.480- 31:01.920* :  from Geoffrey Tal, or Mary and Faithful, or Crowded House. You're raising money for a Ukrainian
*31:01.920- 31:07.340* :  children's hospital. You've also been very vocal against the Russian government. I wonder,
*31:07.700- 31:11.340* :  knowing that you've been fine as well, I'm quoting here what you've been
*31:11.340- 31:17.880* :  fun for what they call discrediting the Russian armed forces. You're laughing here, Boris, but
*31:18.260- 31:21.800* :  for those who are listening, I just want, what do you make of all of this?
*31:22.280- 31:28.580* :  I said what I thought, because when we have in 21st century, in the middle of Europe,
*31:29.300- 31:37.300* :  one country attacks the other without any pretext, without any excuse, just because they want
*31:37.300- 31:42.960* :  the empire to go on. I mean, this is surreal. This is nightmare.
*31:43.600- 31:48.140* :  What is the hope for Russia from you? What do you hope for Russia?
*31:49.220- 31:55.900* :  At the moment, I just hope to establish as many bridges with normal people as I can and try to
*31:55.900- 32:03.360* :  help them somehow. I know the paranoid condition they're in. I know I spend most of my life
*32:03.820- 32:07.760* :  under this condition. So now it's like deadly.
*32:19.120- 32:24.620* :  That was Russian rock star Boris Krobenchikov, who has brought together a host of musicians to
*32:24.620- 32:32.080* :  raise funds for a Ukrainian children's hospital. And that's all from us for now, but there will be
*32:32.080- 32:36.580* :  a new edition of the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast with
