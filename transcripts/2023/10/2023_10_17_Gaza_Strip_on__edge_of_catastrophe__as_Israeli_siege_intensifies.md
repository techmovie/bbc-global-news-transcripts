*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.740* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.100- 00:25.260* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 17th of October, these are our main stories.
*00:25.800- 00:32.480* :  UN agencies have warned of a catastrophe in Gaza as fuel, water and food are within hours of
*00:32.480- 00:37.420* :  running out. Belgian police have shot dead the man who murdered two Swedish football fans
*00:37.420- 00:43.720* :  and India's Supreme Court has declined to allow same-sex marriages. Also in this podcast,
*00:48.080- 00:53.560* :  why the appeal of building a new world is leading to record sales for one video game.
*00:57.960- 01:04.040* :  We begin this podcast in Gaza. Life-saving supplies are waiting in trucks at the border in Egypt,
*01:04.040- 01:10.300* :  a waiting permission to enter. There are warnings of a humanitarian disaster if a doesn't get through
*01:10.300- 01:16.600* :  soon. The population of Han Unis in southern Gaza has almost doubled with hundreds of thousands
*01:16.600- 01:22.740* :  of Palestinians fleeing from the north. The UN has warned that Israel's urging of the move without
*01:22.740- 01:29.220* :  providing food or accommodation could be a war crime. Juliet Tumour, a spokeswoman for the UN
*01:29.220- 01:36.160* :  Agency for Palestinian refugees, says they are providing aid where possible. We are overwhelmed.
*01:36.160- 01:43.920* :  Our supplies are dwindling and running out fast. Our staff are also very, very tired. They
*01:43.920- 01:50.900* :  have been impacted themselves by the war. Many of them lost loved ones. We have sadly at
*01:50.900- 01:59.280* :  under-lost 14 staff members and these numbers continue to increase. The BBC's Rusty Abu Alouf
*01:59.280- 02:04.680* :  is in Han Unis in southern Gaza, close to the rough acrossing into Egypt. He says witnesses
*02:04.680- 02:10.840* :  filmed an airstrike in the area on Monday. He spoke to us over the constant harm of drones overhead.
*02:11.240- 02:17.120* :  This airstrike is the third in the last couple of days and it targeted the road lead to the
*02:17.120- 02:23.220* :  Egyptian side of the crossing. I was given a rare access to a CC camera inside the terminal
*02:23.220- 02:29.560* :  so I was able to see the damage. The road that access is not usable. They need to repair it.
*02:29.880- 02:35.520* :  They told me they could repair it very quickly and very easily but they need an Egyptian to
*02:35.520- 02:40.620* :  approve the opening of the crossing. So we have to differentiate between the crossing that
*02:40.620- 02:46.520* :  allows people in the visual end and out and the terminal with the commercial side of the crossing.
*02:46.740- 02:52.600* :  I'm not aware of any damage to that property and we haven't heard any airstrike in that area.
*02:53.060- 02:59.600* :  We understand there is 4,000 trucks on the Egyptian side. Not sure if they are close to the border
*02:59.600- 03:05.280* :  but I was able to confirm that they were inside Alarish city which is about 60 kilometers
*03:05.280- 03:12.540* :  to the south of Gaza. This aid convoy is really needed in Gaza. As the local authority here
*03:12.540- 03:17.960* :  saying that we are at the edge of catastrophic situation, the hospital where I stand now is called
*03:17.960- 03:24.140* :  Nasr Hospital. This is the main hospital in the south now providing services for 1.1 million
*03:24.140- 03:30.040* :  people and they said they will shut their operation because they are going to run out of fuel
*03:30.040- 03:36.800* :  and this is going to be a disaster for the city of Hanyuniz. I was rushed to Abu Aluf in southern Gaza.
*03:37.520- 03:43.500* :  President Biden plans to visit Israel on Wednesday. His visit is being seen as a show of solidarity
*03:43.500- 03:49.460* :  as Israel continues its war against Hamas. Yolanda Nell is in Jerusalem and she told us more
*03:49.460- 03:54.920* :  about what's behind the visit. This is a vital wartime solidarity visit. It's been very much
*03:54.920- 04:00.780* :  welcomed by Israeli officials. Already of course we have the big show of military support at least
*04:01.220- 04:06.040* :  two aircraft carriers in the region that the U.S. has sent along with other warships
*04:06.460- 04:12.300* :  to show that it's ready not just to support Israel in this ongoing effort in Gaza but also
*04:12.780- 04:17.220* :  that it wants to try to stop this conflict from bordering. There's a lot of worry at the moment
*04:17.220- 04:22.680* :  about fighting, getting worse with the powerful Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. There have been
*04:22.680- 04:27.180* :  exchanges of fire with the Israeli military just in the past few hours across the border
*04:27.640- 04:33.320* :  and of course threats from Hezbollah's ally Iran which also backs both Hamas and Islamic
*04:33.320- 04:39.340* :  jihad. I think for the Israelis this is coming just as it's getting ready for its escalation.
*04:39.340- 04:44.420* :  It's offensive against Hamas militants in Gaza so this will be almost like a way of getting a
*04:44.420- 04:49.800* :  sign off from the U.S. President. The U.S. Secretary of State said that Mr. Biden will hear from
*04:49.800- 04:54.900* :  Israel how it will conduct its operations in a way that minimizes civilian casualties and it's
*04:54.900- 05:00.300* :  also about dealing with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and we're told that they're going to
*05:00.300- 05:05.000* :  look at ways to enable humanitarian assistance to float to civilians in Gaza in a way that does
*05:05.000- 05:10.120* :  not benefit Hamas. That's the big concern there. There was an indication from Mr. Blinken that
*05:10.120- 05:14.500* :  he and the Israeli Prime Minister had agreed to develop a plan to get humanitarian aid into Gaza
*05:14.500- 05:19.800* :  but he didn't provide details. There has been a lot of talk about the Israeli ground offensive.
*05:20.440- 05:26.560* :  Will Mr. Biden's presence be expected to affect its timing? There's going to be huge security
*05:26.620- 05:32.580* :  involved in this visit even though it's just a very brief one. I mean Mr. Blinken will be aware
*05:32.580- 05:37.640* :  of the dangers he had to go into a bunker at one point when he was meeting the Israeli Prime Minister
*05:37.640- 05:43.300* :  because of rocket fire from Gaza and there are other complications of course in this Israeli
*05:43.300- 05:49.160* :  ground offensive. We know that there are, according to Israel, about 200 people who are being held
*05:49.160- 05:54.580* :  hostage Israelis and some Jewel Nationals including a number of Americans and that is a big
*05:54.580- 06:00.840* :  consideration too. Yolanda Nell in Jerusalem. More than a hundred people remain unaccounted for
*06:00.840- 06:06.380* :  since Hamas launched its attack on Israel from Gaza and volunteers are checking a huge area
*06:06.380- 06:11.740* :  while also ensuring that any remains are collected according to strict Jewish customs.
*06:11.820- 06:18.360* :  Dan Johnson has been following a team from an organization called the 360 National Rescue Unit.
*06:18.980- 06:22.160* :  I should warn you that some details in his report are upsetting.
*06:27.260- 06:33.320* :  On this army base not far from Tel Aviv there is a big warehouse which is dealing with all the
*06:33.320- 06:39.400* :  bodies from last week's attacks. Hundreds that have been brought here for the delicate forensic
*06:39.400- 06:47.860* :  work of identification. Moshe Malayev is a medic and a volunteer. I never saw anything close to
*06:47.860- 06:53.260* :  what I saw. It's been horrible. First body I took out from the truck. She was maybe five or
*06:53.260- 06:57.460* :  six years old girl with a blonde hair, with blue eyes, with terrifying look on her face.
*06:58.960- 07:07.880* :  The body was twisted, burning bodies, the headed bodies, part of bodies, horrible things.
*07:08.220- 07:18.040* :  I've come with Moshe and his colleague Maip Barrel to the area of Israel close to Gaza
*07:18.400- 07:23.920* :  and they've been asked to help with the continued search for the bodies of those who are missing.
*07:24.020- 07:34.120* :  The army said that there is 199 people living in Gaza, and we found just 958 bodies.
*07:34.140- 07:43.600* :  So they're like 100 missing. People was hiding in any holes or caves or anything else.
*07:46.220- 07:52.020* :  We start with smelling. That people smell very strong. You've got a huge area to cover here.
*07:54.000- 07:59.920* :  This is difficult delicate work and it's going on in what's an increasingly active military zone
*07:59.920- 08:06.560* :  because this is exactly where the army build up is taking place. Why is it you guys doing this work?
*08:07.100- 08:12.960* :  You're volunteers, right? Yes. It's a good to do a little bit because we're religious. We feel that
*08:12.960- 08:19.920* :  we do something holy, keep the bodies dignified and we have the Jewish law and you're determined
*08:19.920- 08:25.300* :  to complete that work to give those families the answers. Yeah, absolutely yes. The families are
*08:25.300- 08:30.760* :  broken. The families are broken. Where are we now? There's a lot of cars. There was the party.
*08:31.140- 08:39.240* :  The music festival. Most of the recovery work has already been done here, but the guys are going
*08:39.240- 08:47.800* :  through checking things like tents. We're actually looking for blood or businesses. Organists. Body parts.
*08:48.040- 08:54.380* :  Sound. I give it. It's up ahead. They found what they think might be at a piece of somebody's
*08:54.420- 08:59.000* :  scalp. It doesn't look like there's some hair. So they're just putting on a mask and gloves
*08:59.840- 09:06.200* :  and collecting that up. So anything you found will be DNA tested. They'll try and match it.
*09:06.320- 09:14.960* :  I hope because there is so many, so many dead organs. You're a blood. A lot. A lot of blood.
*09:16.100- 09:21.660* :  Maybe to bring. Much more difficult for me to be here than being with the bodies. Really? Yes.
*09:22.860- 09:28.660* :  I mean, I can see the life that's been stopped in one second. You can actually see that here.
*09:29.380- 09:34.220* :  Evil needs to be eliminated from the world. I mean, I feel sorry for the innocent people who
*09:34.220- 09:40.320* :  die in Gaza. I really do because I know I see bodies here. I know what it is, but
*09:40.320- 09:45.400* :  unfortunately, we don't have time to think about them. We just need to think about ourselves right
*09:45.400- 09:50.540* :  now. What's the thing you've seen that you've found saddest, most upsetting, or sad the biggest
*09:50.560- 09:55.180* :  impact on you? Children. Children. A lot of children.
*09:57.180- 10:03.100* :  Moshe Malaya, ending that report by Dan Johnson. Now, you might have heard the special edition
*10:03.140- 10:08.540* :  that we recorded, answering listeners' questions on events in Israel and Gaza. The response was
*10:08.540- 10:13.580* :  such that we are going to do another one. So, do please send us your questions. Anything that you
*10:13.580- 10:19.400* :  want to explain and our correspondence will try to provide context and clarity. You know what to
*10:19.400- 10:24.540* :  do? Please record us a voice message or simply write your question and email it to the usual address
*10:24.540- 10:33.140* :  global podcast at bbc.co.uk. Belgian police have shot and killed a man who was wanted in
*10:33.140- 10:37.520* :  connection with the murder of two Swedish football fans in Brussels on Monday evening.
*10:37.520- 10:43.220* :  The 45-year-old suspect was shot and killed in a cafe by police on Tuesday morning.
*10:43.260- 10:49.500* :  Giving details at a news conference, the Belgian Justice Minister Vincent van Quickenborner
*10:49.900- 10:54.560* :  said the attacker was known to the authorities and is thought to have been inspired by militant
*10:54.560- 11:02.140* :  Islamists. The suspect is a 45-year-old Tunisian who applied for asylum in our country in November 2019.
*11:02.220- 11:08.160* :  He was known to the police for suspicious acts, human trafficking, illegal residents and breaches
*11:08.160- 11:14.900* :  of state security. In July 2016, unconfirmed information was passed on by a foreign police
*11:14.900- 11:20.500* :  service that the man had a radicalised profile and wanted to leave for a conflict zone to wage
*11:20.500- 11:26.780* :  G-head. Another person was injured in Monday nights attack ahead of the Belgium Sweden football match
*11:26.780- 11:32.360* :  in the capital. The BBC's Sophia Bettitzer, who is in Brussels, told us more about the suspect.
*11:32.900- 11:37.860* :  He was shot dead by police in Scarbeck, which is a neighbourhood of Brussels,
*11:37.900- 11:43.980* :  where he lived. He was shot at a cafe, just a few streets where I'm talking to you from,
*11:43.980- 11:49.060* :  and this whole area has now been codoned off and there's quite a big police presence.
*11:49.560- 11:55.580* :  The police is treating this as a terrorist attack and they have raised the alert level four
*11:55.580- 12:00.500* :  Brussels to four, which is the highest level, and it means that a threat could be imminent.
*12:01.200- 12:05.520* :  And just to take a step back, remind us about what happened with the shootings last night.
*12:07.000- 12:14.060* :  So last night at around 7 pm, the government opened fire in central Brussels. He had an automatic
*12:14.060- 12:20.600* :  rifle and he shot dead two Swedish nationals. Now they were both wearing football shirts,
*12:20.600- 12:26.000* :  so it is very possible that they were hearing Brussels for a football match that was taking place
*12:26.000- 12:33.180* :  here last night. Now we have been sent videos of a man who was filming himself on a scooter,
*12:33.840- 12:39.880* :  speaking in Arabic and saying that he killed people in the name of God. Now we haven't verified
*12:39.880- 12:47.080* :  that video, but the federal prosecutors say that the man in the video is indeed the gunman and
*12:47.080- 12:51.640* :  they don't know what the motive of the killing is, but they believe that he was inspired
*12:52.180- 12:56.120* :  by the Islamic State group and that is why they're treating this as a terrorist attack.
*12:56.380- 12:59.920* :  And just finally Sofia, what sort of reaction has there been across Europe?
*13:01.160- 13:07.420* :  So I mean this sort of attack is very unusual for a place like Brussels. The authorities have
*13:07.420- 13:12.400* :  made it very clear that they don't think this is in any way related to what is happening to the
*13:12.400- 13:20.040* :  Middle East, but of course this comes just a few days after a man stabbed to death, a teacher in
*13:20.040- 13:25.880* :  France. And so there is a lot of a lot of people in Europe are quite nervous at the possibility of
*13:25.880- 13:33.360* :  more terror attacks. Sofia Betts are in Brussels. Do Ukraine now wear tens of thousands of people
*13:33.360- 13:38.840* :  have lost limbs because of land mines that Russian troops have spread over at least a third of the
*13:38.840- 13:45.140* :  country. Now a Ukrainian company that once made springs for trucks has changed attack and is
*13:45.140- 13:51.920* :  manufacturing attachments for boots that will help soldiers remove mines safely. Wendy Erker reports.
*13:54.880- 14:00.660* :  A mine exploding is probably the most frightening prospect for any soldier or civilian.
*14:01.340- 14:07.380* :  And during the war in Ukraine thousands of what are known as butterfly mines have been dropped
*14:07.380- 14:14.100* :  across the country. Stepping on one could cause major damage to your foot and a growing number
*14:14.100- 14:21.360* :  of people are losing limbs because of them. But that could be all about to change because at a factory
*14:21.360- 14:28.760* :  in Ukraine more than forty three D printers are in full swing making what are called spider boots.
*14:29.440- 14:36.280* :  Their made of heavy duty plastic have four prongs on the bottom and adjustable straps on the top
*14:36.300- 14:44.140* :  similar to the attachments on skis and they fit over normal shoes or boots. The prongs elevate the
*14:44.140- 14:51.160* :  foot which means the epicenter of the blast is further away. The spider boots were tested using
*14:51.160- 14:58.960* :  mannequins and a hundred grams of TNT. Vadim Voxenko from the Ukrainian Spring Centre says it took
*14:58.960- 15:06.420* :  a while to get it right but now in every test the foot of the mannequin survives and the sole of the
*15:06.420- 15:13.720* :  spider boot remains intact. We printed five different prototypes using different plastics.
*15:14.500- 15:18.700* :  Now one boot can withstand an explosion equal to two hundred kilos.
*15:19.680- 15:25.380* :  They're not the first spider boots ever to be made but they are the first to be manufactured
*15:25.380- 15:33.200* :  in Ukraine. At four hundred dollars a pair they're not cheap but they are desperately needed.
*15:34.300- 15:39.340* :  Wendierka reporting. Still to come in this podcast.
*15:39.640- 15:45.100* :  It's an art for so it has all to do with art but also being in fashion.
*15:45.640- 15:53.260* :  From Adel's tuxedo nails to JLo's glazed doughnut how painting nails became a multi-billion dollar
*15:53.260- 15:55.740* :  business that attracts a lot of competition.
*15:59.480- 16:05.980* :  The Indian Supreme Court has declined to recognize same-sex marriage. The Chief Justice said laws
*16:05.980- 16:10.960* :  on marriage equality were the domain of parliament but the court asked the government to review
*16:10.960- 16:16.800* :  legislation so that same-sex partners had the same benefits as married couples. A number of
*16:16.800- 16:22.060* :  same-sex couples had petitioned the court arguing that not being able to marry violated their
*16:22.060- 16:27.620* :  constitutional rights and made them second-class citizens. Outside the court activists had
*16:27.620- 16:31.900* :  assembled to hear the judgment. The court has given a partial judgment. It's a diplomatic
*16:31.900- 16:36.020* :  judgment but I am trying to focus on the positive side that it has happened that I can finally adopt
*16:36.020- 16:41.720* :  a child of my own. So of course this is a start. A person from village also can recognize that if
*16:41.720- 16:46.580* :  they are from a same-sex person and they can get marriage and they can register their marriage.
*16:47.100- 16:51.620* :  I have really been disappointed by the judgment because I expected same-sex man to get
*16:51.620- 16:56.360* :  decalized with an unfortunate date then. A correspondent Samira Hussein was out the court in Delhi.
*16:56.720- 17:02.480* :  It was a really nuanced decision. What the court said was that they are not in a position
*17:03.140- 17:08.760* :  to say that legalized marriage should that same-sex marriage rather should be legalized.
*17:09.180- 17:13.780* :  That is an issue that should be left up to parliament. So they were essentially sort of saying
*17:13.780- 17:19.060* :  well this is something that parliament needs to do. However all five Supreme Court
*17:19.060- 17:25.700* :  justices agreed that same-sex marriage should be allowed. And what they're really saying here is
*17:25.700- 17:32.160* :  that look there are so many material benefits that married couples get like tax benefits and
*17:32.480- 17:38.200* :  pension benefits that they are being discriminated against because they're not able to enter into
*17:38.200- 17:43.540* :  a marital union. They can't get those benefits and so what they've tasked the government to do
*17:43.960- 17:49.300* :  is to go back and figure out ways to make sure that they're not discriminated against
*17:49.300- 17:54.080* :  because they're not allowed to get married. And what sort of reaction has there been from those
*17:54.080- 17:59.920* :  who've been pressing for same-sex marriage? What next for them? Well it's interesting. I'm actually
*17:59.920- 18:05.280* :  outside the Supreme Court and there were many activists that had gathered here to listen to the
*18:05.280- 18:11.020* :  verdict and you just saw clumps of people huddled around a cell phone to listen to the live stream
*18:11.020- 18:16.880* :  of the verdict and as it became more and more clear you can sense the sort of the the atmosphere
*18:17.440- 18:23.200* :  sort of became a lot more quiet. It just seemed that people were deflated, disappointed again that
*18:23.200- 18:28.560* :  the court had decided that it can't adjudicate in this matter. As you say though it wasn't a
*18:28.560- 18:36.280* :  fairly nuanced judgment. How much of a hot topic has this actually been in India? What have people
*18:36.280- 18:42.140* :  been saying about it? Well it's certainly a topic of massive amounts of importance to the tens
*18:42.140- 18:51.040* :  of millions of LGBTQ people here in this country. And remember India in 2018 actually decriminalized
*18:51.220- 18:57.620* :  gay sex which was seen as a big move for the country. This was sort of the next logical step for
*18:57.620- 19:04.980* :  activists to have same-sex marriages recognized. And so it is a topic of great importance for so many
*19:04.980- 19:11.640* :  people, especially young people in this country. Samira Hussein in Delhi. The Amazon Rainforest is
*19:11.640- 19:17.660* :  experiencing one of its worst droughts on record. On Monday the Amazon River was recorded at its
*19:17.660- 19:23.520* :  lowest level in more than a century. At one point of the river in Manaus, the region's most popular
*19:23.520- 19:30.180* :  city, the water level is four meters lower than this time last year and it's causing huge problems
*19:30.180- 19:35.540* :  for people living there. Professor Lorenzo Pellegrini from the International Institute of Social
*19:35.540- 19:41.580* :  Studies in the Netherlands has been studying deforestation in the Amazon. There are several effects here
*19:42.040- 19:47.760* :  that probably are playing a role. So there is global climate change of course that makes these
*19:47.760- 19:53.340* :  events more likely and then there is local climate change. And of course the drought also
*19:53.340- 19:58.580* :  making more possible more likely to have yet more deforestation because these are conditions
*19:58.580- 20:05.000* :  are perfect for wildfires. This is a part of a chain of events that have definitely consequences
*20:05.020- 20:12.300* :  at the global level. We have seen wildlife and dangerous species victims of this. For example,
*20:12.300- 20:19.040* :  the pink river dolphin, which is one of those emblematic mammals that are endangered in the
*20:19.040- 20:23.700* :  Amazon. But of course there is much, much more. There is so much biodiversity that we don't know
*20:23.700- 20:30.000* :  even most of the species are there. The Amazon Basin of course is the way transportation takes place
*20:30.000- 20:36.280* :  there. But of course it's also the source of water for local communities especially in rural areas.
*20:36.820- 20:43.080* :  So the water there is really the way transportation takes place but also fundamental for the livelihood
*20:43.080- 20:49.760* :  of the local communities. For example, if they're out of clean sources of water, they will use water
*20:49.760- 20:55.680* :  that is much less clean. And if they run out also of gas, they will not be able, for example,
*20:55.680- 21:01.960* :  to boil their water. So these are then also quite dangerous situations also for human health.
*21:02.360- 21:08.420* :  Professor Lorenzo Pellegrini. Microplastics are a growing concern for governments around the world.
*21:08.420- 21:14.140* :  And now the European Commission is stepping up its attempts to tackle microplastic pollution.
*21:14.880- 21:19.460* :  Under new rules, products that aren't deliberately made with microplastics are banned.
*21:19.580- 21:25.100* :  But that's not all. They also want companies to check for possible leaks when making things with
*21:25.100- 21:31.060* :  microplastic pellets. Here's the BBC's Katie Silver. So these are called noodles. They basically act
*21:31.060- 21:35.020* :  like the building blocks for most of the world's plastic production. They're going to everything
*21:35.020- 21:40.160* :  from car bumpers, office chairs, water bottles, salad bowls, you name it. But the problem is they
*21:40.160- 21:44.320* :  leak into the environment at every step of the supply chain. So the Commission estimates that
*21:44.320- 21:50.000* :  there's a between 52,000 and 184,000 tons of plastic pellets that are released into the
*21:50.000- 21:53.920* :  environment in the EU each year. So they're hoping to introduce a number of tougher rules for
*21:53.920- 21:58.220* :  companies that use the tiny materials. These companies are going to need to conduct risk assessments
*21:58.220- 22:02.260* :  to make sure that they don't do any spillage. And if they do, the measures that they can take
*22:02.620- 22:07.340* :  once this happens, larger companies are going to need these plans verified by independent operators.
*22:07.340- 22:14.480* :  And they can place sanctions for violations. Katie Silver. Manacures and nail art are very
*22:14.480- 22:20.560* :  big business. The industry's worth more than $20 billion globally. Nowadays, it's fueled by
*22:20.560- 22:26.600* :  social media where people share their designs. Over the past two days, hundreds of technicians from
*22:26.600- 22:31.300* :  more than 30 countries have been taking this to the next level, attending the world's biggest
*22:31.300- 22:37.960* :  nail art competition known as nail impier here in London. Our reporter Nikki Cardwell went along.
*22:39.460- 22:44.640* :  I'm looking at one of the finished entries for this year's nail impier. Each individual nail
*22:44.640- 22:49.440* :  is beautifully painted and detailed. But when the model's fingers are held together,
*22:50.100- 22:56.360* :  they make up an amazingly complex design. All the entries have to be properly applied to the
*22:56.360- 23:02.740* :  model's hand and be structurally sound as well as beautiful. Anna Cavandasar from the Netherlands
*23:02.740- 23:07.960* :  is the competition's chief judge. She thinks the appeal is that these spectacular designs
*23:07.980- 23:15.560* :  can be worn by anyone. It's an art form, but it's also becoming like an accessory for the end user
*23:15.860- 23:20.420* :  because she wants to have your nails painted or colored or she's going to a special party.
*23:20.800- 23:27.820* :  So it has all to do with art, but also being in fashion. I think there is not one woman who
*23:27.820- 23:36.880* :  doesn't wear any color on her nails. Mexico's Ismail Camero won the fantasy category
*23:36.880- 23:47.260* :  with a huge 3D day of the dead design. Because the nails came to my life and that's what I enjoy.
*23:47.700- 23:51.080* :  And would you like to see some of your work in a big museum somewhere?
*23:51.740- 23:54.560* :  I haven't thought about it, but the possibilities are infinite.
*23:54.560- 23:58.580* :  You haven't thought about it, but it's endless possibilities.
*23:59.120- 24:03.100* :  With the Chinese nail market worth nearly two billion pounds a year alone,
*24:03.180- 24:09.120* :  next year, nail impier will be going to China for the first time. The organizers are anticipating
*24:09.120- 24:14.580* :  that it will be their biggest event yet, with the promise of 500 local competitors
*24:15.220- 24:17.000* :  on top of those from the rest of the world.
*24:17.800- 24:22.040* :  Nikki Cardwell. And we end this podcast on a record breaker.
*24:22.420- 24:28.740* :  As Minecraft, the highest selling game of all time becomes the first video game to sell 300
*24:28.740- 24:35.020* :  million copies. So what's the appeal? In essence, it's all about building a virtual world.
*24:39.920- 24:44.340* :  That's what that is. That's building a virtual world. Peter Goffin told Alex Ritz and more
*24:44.340- 24:49.420* :  about why Minecraft keeps outselling any other game by such a huge margin.
*24:49.820- 24:53.480* :  The makers of Minecraft, a Swedish company called Mojang Studios,
*24:53.480- 24:59.040* :  announced this achievement at the weekend that the game has sold 300 million copies since its release
*24:59.780- 25:05.220* :  14 years ago. Now, as you mentioned, Minecraft is already the highest selling video game of all
*25:05.220- 25:13.220* :  time by a long shot. Grand Theft Auto 5 is a distant second, having sold 185 million copies over
*25:13.220- 25:18.540* :  the past 10 years. So what makes Minecraft so popular? Well, at its most basic, it's about
*25:18.540- 25:24.000* :  using blocks to build things, a bit like digital Lego, except you can't really run out of blocks
*25:24.000- 25:30.400* :  and you can't run out of space. So you can create cities, mountains, entire landscapes and interact
*25:30.400- 25:35.880* :  with players online. It's challenging enough for adults, but it's also become known, especially
*25:35.880- 25:40.780* :  as a game that a lot of parents are happy for their children to play because it's an outlet for
*25:41.580- 25:46.740* :  creativity and strategy and unlike Grand Theft Auto. For instance, Minecraft is not based around
*25:46.740- 25:53.160* :  violence or mature themes. Yeah, it's incredible. 300 million copies of Minecraft. So that really
*25:53.160- 25:58.380* :  says something about the whole strength of the industry, doesn't it? It does, and I don't want to
*25:58.380- 26:04.040* :  burst Minecraft's bubble, but it's not even the biggest video game brand out there. It's sold
*26:04.040- 26:10.020* :  the most for a single standalone game, but Tetris, the puzzle game that came out in the 1980s,
*26:10.020- 26:17.100* :  has sold more than 500 million copies of its various versions, and my favorite, my generations
*26:17.100- 26:22.920* :  favorite, the Mario franchise, maybe the best-known video game of all time, has sold more than 800
*26:22.980- 26:28.700* :  million copies of its games. It's become a bonafide cultural phenomenon.
*26:29.740- 26:30.960* :  That is Peter Goffin.
*26:33.620- 26:37.780* :  And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*26:38.100- 26:41.320* :  If you would like to comment on this edition or the topics covered in it,
