*01:26.000- 01:31.240* :  I'm Charlotte Gallagher and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 17th of October, these are
*01:31.240- 01:32.120* :  our main stories.
*01:32.640- 01:38.700* :  The desperate situation facing people fleeing their homes in Gaza is the hope any aid will
*01:38.700- 01:39.220* :  get through.
*01:41.180- 01:43.920* :  We have nothing that we need to live, says one man.
*01:43.920- 01:47.160* :  We're living in a dump and if we move, we will die.
*01:48.520- 01:54.220* :  Iran says the prospect of the war between Hamas and Israel spreading to other fronts is
*01:54.220- 01:55.340* :  becoming inevitable.
*01:56.100- 01:59.420* :  And two Swedish people have been shot dead in Brussels.
*01:59.420- 02:01.300* :  The gunman is still on the loose.
*02:01.840- 02:03.840* :  We have the latest from the Belgian capital.
*02:07.180- 02:12.860* :  Also in this podcast, the US is reeling after a six year old boy is stabbed to death,
*02:12.860- 02:14.760* :  reportedly for being Muslim.
*02:15.300- 02:15.940* :  It hits home.
*02:16.360- 02:17.440* :  You don't feel safe now.
*02:17.560- 02:22.080* :  I'm on Facebook, literally I was going after me right now, calling me a terrorist.
*02:22.980- 02:30.760* :  And another art gallery in the UK admits to having lost more than 1,700 items, including
*02:30.760- 02:34.660* :  a piece that's worth more than three and a half million dollars.
*02:39.420- 02:44.140* :  But first, there were hopes on Monday morning that a temporary ceasefire would allow the
*02:44.140- 02:49.340* :  only border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to open, which would allow foreign nationals
*02:49.340- 02:52.060* :  to leave and humanitarian aid to enter.
*02:52.580- 02:54.400* :  But so far, that has not happened.
*02:54.920- 02:58.560* :  We'll hear about the diplomatic negotiations to break the deadlock in a moment.
*02:58.560- 03:04.720* :  But first, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have
*03:04.720- 03:08.780* :  now fled from the north to the south and are in urgent need of help.
*03:09.080- 03:10.000* :  John Donerson reports.
*03:12.840- 03:18.320* :  A midday destruction in southern Gaza, the homeless and the hungry in their hundreds
*03:18.320- 03:20.400* :  of thousands are trying to survive.
*03:23.140- 03:26.860* :  We have nothing that we need to live, says one man, who's fled from the north.
*03:27.380- 03:30.480* :  We're living in a dump and if we move, we will die.
*03:33.000- 03:38.020* :  Workers are shifting huge piles of rotting rubbish and with too few toilets, there are
*03:38.060- 03:39.500* :  fears about the spread of disease.
*03:40.600- 03:42.400* :  There's food, but not enough.
*03:44.760- 03:49.780* :  In Can Unis, Amir is stirring huge pots of soup and rice by the roadside.
*03:50.560- 03:55.580* :  Once a town of 400,000, suddenly, they're having to provide for more than a million.
*03:56.700- 03:59.860* :  All this will feed less than 2,000 people, says Amir.
*04:00.720- 04:02.940* :  It's just a fraction of those in need.
*04:04.920- 04:08.360* :  There are long queues to get bread, but it's been rationed.
*04:10.580- 04:15.400* :  We've been waiting here since six in the morning one man tells us, just to get food to feed
*04:15.400- 04:15.900* :  the kids.
*04:17.200- 04:21.200* :  We left our homes in the north because we thought there would be aid, but where is
*04:21.200- 04:22.020* :  it he goes on?
*04:22.400- 04:24.500* :  Give us electricity, give us water.
*04:26.480- 04:31.060* :  And all the while the hospitals in the south, like in the rest of Gaza, are overwhelmed
*04:31.060- 04:33.740* :  with patients from the old to the very young.
*04:37.580- 04:40.700* :  In Raffa, a doctor holds a tiny baby in his arms.
*04:42.040- 04:45.600* :  Poor Al-Batch was born amid the chaos less than a week ago.
*04:46.420- 04:48.520* :  What kind of life lies ahead of her?
*04:52.160- 04:53.580* :  That was John Donerson reporting.
*04:54.120- 04:58.340* :  So is it any clearer if or when this border crossing will open?
*04:58.340- 05:01.720* :  Our Middle East correspondent in Jerusalem is Tom Bayman.
*05:02.260- 05:06.260* :  No, there were some hopes raised that first thing this morning, it might open today.
*05:06.340- 05:10.160* :  Not only has that not happened, but the fighting has intensified.
*05:10.260- 05:14.380* :  The Israelis have bombed an area close to the Raffa crossing and part of the road there
*05:14.380- 05:14.880* :  is damaged.
*05:15.240- 05:17.980* :  Now that in itself may not make a huge amount of difference.
*05:17.980- 05:22.940* :  They bombed it a couple of times last week and it's still possible or was still possible
*05:24.160- 05:25.080* :  at that particular point.
*05:25.080- 05:28.960* :  It's obviously not a very good sign when what the Egyptians are saying is they desperately
*05:28.960- 05:33.100* :  want the crossing to open so that they can get that aid into Gaza.
*05:33.580- 05:38.020* :  And they've effectively made that conditional on them accepting foreign passport holders
*05:38.020- 05:43.220* :  or Palestinians with foreign passports to come over to the Egyptian side, which many
*05:43.220- 05:44.660* :  are desperately trying to do.
*05:44.660- 05:48.420* :  And that's why there are thousands of people gathered at that border.
*05:48.420- 05:53.120* :  So it's very hard to see that there'll be a breakthrough in the coming hours.
*05:53.300- 05:55.980* :  But clearly the diplomatic efforts are continuing.
*05:56.200- 05:59.760* :  And we've been expecting the Israeli army to go into Gaza.
*06:00.020- 06:01.100* :  What's the latest on that?
*06:01.780- 06:07.220* :  Well, there's an absolutely huge force of Israeli military ranged and gathered around
*06:07.340- 06:08.980* :  the Gaza perimeter.
*06:09.520- 06:15.680* :  The sense we had over the weekend on Saturday from the Israeli military was that they released
*06:15.680- 06:18.320* :  a fairly detailed statement which suggested they were ready.
*06:18.840- 06:23.800* :  A bit more work to do on logistics and sort of supplying their forward operating bases
*06:23.800- 06:25.660* :  that they were installing in that area there.
*06:25.820- 06:28.800* :  But the word at that point was that it's now a political decision.
*06:29.400- 06:29.960* :  So we're waiting.
*06:30.120- 06:34.460* :  And it seemed unlikely that anything might happen today given that Anthony Blinken was
*06:34.920- 06:35.460* :  in Israel.
*06:36.040- 06:41.200* :  With the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has invited US President Joe Biden
*06:41.440- 06:42.380* :  to Israel.
*06:42.380- 06:45.320* :  Now that seemed to fell extraordinary sort of invitation.
*06:45.560- 06:47.020* :  There has been continuing speculation.
*06:47.060- 06:51.220* :  We have nothing confirmed at all in the Israeli press that that offer could be taken up.
*06:51.220- 06:56.540* :  It seems unlikely, I have to say, but if there is any move on that front, then obviously
*06:56.540- 06:58.980* :  it would seem very unlikely a ground invasion would start.
*06:59.340- 07:04.520* :  And when you look at some of Israel's previous land invasions, in some cases, for example,
*07:04.580- 07:11.020* :  in the last war with Hezbollah and Lebanon, I mean, it was around three weeks or so of
*07:11.020- 07:13.720* :  preparations before the ground troops moved.
*07:13.720- 07:18.920* :  So we don't know, but clearly what the message they're trying to get out is that they are
*07:18.960- 07:19.620* :  ready to go.
*07:20.160- 07:21.560* :  Tom Bateman in Jerusalem.
*07:22.420- 07:27.420* :  Meanwhile, there's been a warning from Iran about the dangers of any conflict between Israel
*07:27.420- 07:28.660* :  and Hamas spreading.
*07:28.780- 07:34.420* :  The warning comes as violence continues along the Israeli Lebanese border, the armed movement
*07:34.420- 07:40.120* :  Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has been exchanging fire for days with Israeli troops.
*07:40.640- 07:45.160* :  Diplomatic editor James Landel told me more about what the Iranian foreign minister
*07:45.160- 07:46.840* :  said and why it matters.
*07:47.400- 07:54.160* :  In recent days, Iran has been stepping up its rhetoric, trying to warn Israel that if
*07:54.160- 07:57.020* :  it does launch a ground offensive, there will be consequences.
*07:57.540- 08:01.480* :  So they've used phrases in the past like, well, if Israel goes in, no one can guarantee
*08:01.480- 08:06.000* :  what's going to happen or they said, if Israel goes in, there's a risk of the huge earthquake.
*08:06.720- 08:11.640* :  Today, Iran's foreign minister has said in Amir Abdul Ali and went much further and
*08:11.640- 08:16.420* :  saying that there is now a possibility that the war between Israel and Hamas will spread
*08:16.420- 08:21.520* :  to other fronts and that moment is reaching what he called the unavoidable stage and that
*08:21.520- 08:23.560* :  time is running out for political solutions.
*08:24.040- 08:28.320* :  In other words, just again, putting more pressure onto Israel, say, look, if this ground
*08:28.320- 08:32.620* :  offensive begins, then potentially there are consequences and everybody is inferring
*08:32.620- 08:35.240* :  from those words that he's talking about Hezbollah.
*08:35.280- 08:40.560* :  The Iranian-backed militants, based in Lebanon, launching some kind of escalated attack on Israel
*08:40.560- 08:44.020* :  from the north, which is something that everybody is trying to prevent and the Americans are
*08:44.020- 08:44.660* :  trying to deter.
*08:45.260- 08:49.760* :  The American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken back in Israel today, after several days
*08:49.760- 08:54.680* :  of frantic diplomacy, let's hear what he had to say at an appearance alongside the Israeli
*08:54.980- 08:55.460* :  Defence Minister.
*08:55.940- 09:01.860* :  You know our deep commitment to Israel's right indeed its obligation to defend itself and
*09:01.860- 09:06.040* :  to defend its people and in that you have always had the support of the United States.
*09:06.760- 09:11.360* :  Interested to hear what you think about that and whether the US diplomatic push is making
*09:11.360- 09:12.220* :  any progress?
*09:12.760- 09:17.040* :  I thought what was fascinating is that those words that Mr Blinken spoke are the only words
*09:17.040- 09:17.600* :  he spoke.
*09:17.780- 09:21.180* :  Normally when he comes to every country he does a press availability and he'll take two
*09:21.180- 09:23.180* :  of his questions and say this is to deliver his messages.
*09:23.580- 09:28.200* :  Today he wanted to say as little as possible apart from a sort of routine support for Israel.
*09:28.200- 09:30.580* :  So I suspect that things are moving.
*09:30.620- 09:33.980* :  He doesn't want to say anything publicly about it at the moment.
*09:33.980- 09:36.720* :  That's just my inference from what he just said.
*09:36.720- 09:41.780* :  As of any success, so far we haven't seen any border opening, we haven't seen any foreign
*09:41.780- 09:46.040* :  nationals taken out, we haven't seen anything that seems to give greater protection to
*09:46.040- 09:46.500* :  the civilians.
*09:46.640- 09:51.140* :  And that's because those are all important issues but the overriding issue is still this
*09:51.140- 09:56.140* :  one of trying to prevent this situation escalating and that means not just sending messages
*09:56.140- 09:59.700* :  to Iran to try to deter them, launching some kind of second front.
*09:59.700- 10:05.320* :  But also sending messages to Israel saying, look, the way you attack Hamas and Gaza will
*10:05.320- 10:10.500* :  have an impact on how the wider world and particularly in the region will respond and
*10:10.500- 10:14.920* :  the more aggressive and excessive you are, the more likely it is to trigger some kind
*10:14.920- 10:15.640* :  of second front.
*10:16.000- 10:16.820* :  James Landell.
*10:17.340- 10:23.100* :  Social media has been inundated with claims, many of them false, many conspiracy theories,
*10:23.540- 10:27.280* :  and other malicious content about what's happening at Israel and Gaza.
*10:27.740- 10:32.500* :  There are questions over whether fake accounts are being used to manipulate the conversation.
*10:33.120- 10:37.420* :  The BBC's disinformation and social media correspondent is Marianne Spring.
*10:38.000- 10:42.340* :  I'm sure a lot of people have been spotting all kinds of conspiracy theories, disinformation
*10:42.460- 10:43.560* :  hate on their feeds.
*10:43.600- 10:48.620* :  When I opened up my TikTok feed last week, I was met with a very distressing video of a
*10:48.620- 10:53.260* :  young Israeli woman being taken by Hamas militants being put into a car being held hostage.
*10:53.300- 10:57.460* :  But when I looked at the comments, I was quite surprised to see that as well as some shock,
*10:57.460- 11:01.660* :  there were several people suggesting this woman was not a civilian but instead a soldier
*11:01.660- 11:06.320* :  or that this was somehow staged in order to frame Hamas militants.
*11:06.460- 11:08.760* :  And this was a video that we at the BBC had verified.
*11:08.760- 11:10.140* :  It was very clearly a civilian.
*11:10.620- 11:12.560* :  And there's been disinformation from everywhere.
*11:12.560- 11:16.520* :  There are other claims seeking to cast doubt on violence happening in Gaza.
*11:16.520- 11:21.320* :  There was one video that showed a woman makeup artist applying makeup to people's faces.
*11:21.320- 11:26.500* :  It was from an old news report from 2017, but the post was suggesting that somehow people
*11:26.500- 11:31.580* :  in Gaza who have been hurt or lost their lives were actually faking their injuries in some way.
*11:32.140- 11:33.160* :  And who's behind it?
*11:33.300- 11:35.860* :  There are some more obvious sources of misinformation.
*11:35.860- 11:40.220* :  Take, for example, pop star Justin Bieber, who posted on his Instagram story saying,
*11:40.220- 11:45.700* :  pray for Israel, but underneath he showed a picture of destruction in Gaza by Israeli forces.
*11:46.240- 11:49.120* :  And then you've also got accounts that are renowned,
*11:49.120- 11:52.040* :  certainly in the world of disinformation for pushing conspiracy theories,
*11:52.040- 11:54.380* :  whether that's about the war in Ukraine or the pandemic,
*11:54.380- 11:56.020* :  and they've turned their attention to this,
*11:56.340- 12:00.780* :  maybe sharing footage from other conflicts or sharing video game footage
*12:00.780- 12:04.240* :  to try and either downplay or exaggerate violence on the ground.
*12:04.340- 12:08.160* :  But in some cases, it's a little bit harder to work out who they are and where they're based.
*12:08.160- 12:09.460* :  I looked into several.
*12:09.900- 12:14.340* :  Some of them seem to be real young people who are also sharing videos of football games
*12:14.560- 12:15.880* :  and other kinds of memes,
*12:15.940- 12:18.580* :  but who seem to believe some of the disinformation.
*12:19.140- 12:21.200* :  Others were accounts that were newly set up,
*12:21.200- 12:23.880* :  sharing quite divisive misleading content,
*12:23.880- 12:27.240* :  everything from support of Russian President Vladimir Putin
*12:27.240- 12:29.820* :  and talking about former US President Donald Trump
*12:30.180- 12:31.880* :  to then turning their attention to this.
*12:32.380- 12:34.880* :  And those are some of the clues that an account might be an authentic
*12:34.880- 12:38.060* :  if it's newly created and it's sharing divisive misleading content.
*12:38.380- 12:42.340* :  And ultimately, it can be really hard to get to the bottom of whether an account isn't real or not,
*12:42.340- 12:46.380* :  basically because we rely on the social media companies to share that information with us.
*12:46.640- 12:48.820* :  Disinformation online can really muddy the water
*12:48.820- 12:52.300* :  and it can make it much more difficult to work out the truth of what's going on.
*12:52.820- 12:56.640* :  And that's really important because especially when you're relying on social media for updates,
*12:57.180- 12:59.360* :  it can really make it hard to figure out what's going on.
*12:59.400- 13:02.900* :  It can make it hard for the international community who are tasked with providing aid
*13:02.900- 13:05.280* :  or investigating allegations of war crimes.
*13:05.280- 13:07.700* :  So it's a reminder to just stop and think before you share.
*13:08.300- 13:09.380* :  That was Mariana Spring.
*13:10.100- 13:13.940* :  As we've been hearing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled
*13:13.940- 13:19.160* :  northern Gaza after Israel told them to leave ahead of an expected ground offensive.
*13:19.680- 13:23.500* :  The Israeli military puts the figure at around half a million that have left.
*13:24.200- 13:26.780* :  One of those is Kamal Al-Masha Rawi.
*13:26.780- 13:30.540* :  He spoke to the BBC last week when he was stuck in a basement shelter
*13:31.120- 13:34.940* :  with around 65 people and no water in Gaza City.
*13:34.940- 13:40.120* :  Now he's in Khan Unis waiting across the border into Egypt with his family when it opens.
*13:40.240- 13:42.340* :  He's been speaking to Nulam Agavan.
*13:42.840- 13:46.060* :  My first plan is to stay alive with the kids and with the family
*13:46.060- 13:47.740* :  and just keep them safe.
*13:48.200- 13:51.900* :  We get injured many times and we face death many, many times.
*13:52.620- 13:56.120* :  And then I'm just fine with that and even if I stay in the street in Egypt
*13:56.280- 13:58.480* :  because there's no any safer place to go to.
*13:58.680- 14:02.980* :  Hopefully they won't get long-term ceasefire agreement in the next few days.
*14:03.360- 14:06.560* :  And we're going to be able to go back to Gaza because we have our house
*14:06.740- 14:10.300* :  who is partly destroyed by coming to place the whole building.
*14:10.380- 14:12.860* :  So I wasn't able to take much with my clothes and things.
*14:13.220- 14:14.920* :  The first thing I took is my passport.
*14:16.680- 14:17.100* :  Are you okay?
*14:17.680- 14:18.440* :  Yeah, we're fine. Just.
*14:18.820- 14:19.600* :  What happened there?
*14:20.200- 14:22.480* :  I think they put something very close to us.
*14:22.840- 14:25.580* :  Are you okay to continue speaking to me if you need to move?
*14:25.580- 14:26.160* :  Just go.
*14:26.460- 14:27.080* :  That's fine.
*14:28.060- 14:28.700* :  I can hear that.
*14:29.320- 14:32.560* :  So yeah, I think they just put one of the neighboring houses.
*14:32.880- 14:35.340* :  So when that's happening, what's going through your mind?
*14:35.700- 14:37.900* :  To answer my mind is that there's another one happening.
*14:38.400- 14:41.400* :  So usually it's two or three hats at a time.
*14:41.400- 14:44.420* :  So when I hear the first one, I just make sure to put my hands through my ears
*14:44.900- 14:48.980* :  away from the windows and the places where I could get a fragment in my face or
*14:49.300- 14:49.840* :  hopefully not.
*14:50.540- 14:55.280* :  I'm struck though that you are smiling, that you are laughing a little bit.
*14:55.580- 14:57.420* :  I mean, is this a way of coping?
*14:58.080- 14:59.800* :  It's not a smile because I'm happy.
*14:59.800- 15:01.320* :  It's just, it's ridiculous, you know,
*15:01.320- 15:07.680* :  because everybody's sitting here has his own lifestyle which was destroyed in the past eight days.
*15:07.680- 15:13.140* :  Everyone of us has his own routine and we're not able to do that anymore
*15:13.140- 15:17.140* :  to have your life flipped upside down in one moment.
*15:17.620- 15:19.280* :  And you're not even part of this conflict.
*15:19.480- 15:23.780* :  You literally lose everything in one second and you're not even part of anything.
*15:24.120- 15:26.940* :  We're just laughing because we feel that this is...
*15:27.120- 15:30.660* :  I can see you, but Nina, hands over your ears again so you may be hearing.
*15:30.980- 15:33.020* :  That's the airplane getting close to us.
*15:33.120- 15:36.240* :  So when it gets close to us, it's going to hit.
*15:36.240- 15:40.040* :  So that's why we make sure that we close our ears, we open our mouth
*15:40.040- 15:44.700* :  because otherwise we've got to get our ears bleeding from the inside.
*15:45.180- 15:48.760* :  Are you able to stay in contact with people I'm most curious about?
*15:49.160- 15:50.920* :  Food, water, how are you managing?
*15:51.720- 15:53.860* :  Actually, I'm using solar energy now.
*15:54.540- 15:56.460* :  We do our best to drink as looking as possible,
*15:56.800- 15:59.840* :  wearing out of food, but luckily we're living in a garden
*16:00.120- 16:02.960* :  or in the morning, two of my uncles went to the city.
*16:03.240- 16:05.600* :  They thought that the owner was giving some aid to people
*16:05.640- 16:07.200* :  and turned out to be incorrect.
*16:07.200- 16:12.920* :  On their way back, they just went to a few shops and it was all empty and packed with people.
*16:12.980- 16:16.600* :  They just came back with two pieces of bread for 85 people.
*16:17.040- 16:20.600* :  That was Kamal Al-Masha Rawi speaking to Nulem Agavan.
*16:20.980- 16:26.000* :  And here's Jackie with some news about another special edition of the Global News podcast.
*16:26.600- 16:28.540* :  You might have heard the special edition we recorded
*16:28.540- 16:31.880* :  answering listeners questions on events in Israel and Gaza
*16:32.280- 16:34.020* :  and international reaction to them.
*16:34.520- 16:38.820* :  A lot of you have since been in touch to ask us to do it again, so we will.
*16:39.360- 16:41.860* :  Send us your questions, anything you want explained
*16:41.860- 16:46.180* :  and our correspondence will endeavor to provide context and clarity.
*16:46.180- 16:49.600* :  Please record us a voice message or simply write your question
*16:49.600- 16:55.220* :  and email it to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*16:55.960- 16:56.300* :  Thank you.
*16:59.900- 17:01.460* :  Europe is being shaken.
*17:01.460- 17:04.300* :  The words of the French President Emmanuel Macron
*17:04.300- 17:08.560* :  after two people of Swedish nationality were shot dead in Brussels.
*17:08.700- 17:14.060* :  Belgium was hosting Sweden in a Euro 2024 qualifying match on Monday,
*17:14.580- 17:16.600* :  a match that has now been abandoned.
*17:16.600- 17:18.660* :  The attacker is still at large.
*17:18.660- 17:22.140* :  Our correspondence of fear Betista is in the Belgian capital.
*17:22.740- 17:27.640* :  The government opened fire here in central Brussels at around seven in the evening.
*17:28.100- 17:32.920* :  He had an automatic rifle and he shot dead two people in the street.
*17:32.920- 17:36.180* :  Now that area has now been codoned off by the police.
*17:36.720- 17:42.320* :  Now a short while ago we were sent a video of a man who was filming himself on a scooter.
*17:42.320- 17:48.120* :  He's speaking in Arabic and he's saying that he's killed three people in the name of God.
*17:48.540- 17:53.720* :  The federal prosecutor here in Brussels is treating this as a terror attack.
*17:53.720- 17:57.400* :  But the motive of the shooting remains unclear.
*17:57.400- 18:02.580* :  What a few people are saying is that the two victims were wearing Sweden football shirts
*18:03.140- 18:04.800* :  and they could have been football fans.
*18:04.800- 18:07.880* :  As you mentioned there, there's a match tonight here in Brussels.
*18:07.880- 18:11.620* :  Belgium against Sweden, there has now been cold off
*18:11.940- 18:17.240* :  and fans are being asked to remain in the stadium as a matter of safety.
*18:17.300- 18:22.060* :  The government remains at large and the police are still looking for him.
*18:22.480- 18:27.040* :  And that's why the alert level here in Brussels has been raised to fall,
*18:27.420- 18:30.800* :  which is the highest level and it means the threat could be imminent.
*18:31.920- 18:36.140* :  A six year old boy has been stabbed to death in the US state of Illinois.
*18:36.900- 18:42.080* :  Reportedly for being Muslim, his mother was also stabbed but is expected to survive.
*18:42.740- 18:45.340* :  The family's landlord has been charged with murder.
*18:45.340- 18:49.900* :  Detectives say he was motivated by the conflict between Israel and Hamas,
*18:50.540- 18:52.500* :  targeting the victims because of their religion.
*18:52.500- 18:55.400* :  Our North America editor Sarah Smith reports.
*18:55.460- 19:00.540* :  President Biden has said he was sickened by the attack that killed Wadiya Al-Fayum
*19:00.540- 19:02.440* :  just weeks after his sixth birthday.
*19:02.820- 19:06.400* :  He and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, rented a floor in Joseph Zuba's house
*19:06.680- 19:07.860* :  as he attacked them on Saturday.
*19:07.860- 19:09.240* :  He allegedly told them,
*19:09.700- 19:13.720* :  you Muslims must die before stabbing them with a military-style knife
*19:14.000- 19:15.440* :  Wadiya died later in hospital.
*19:15.440- 19:19.080* :  Mr Zuba has been charged with a hate crime and first degree murder.
*19:19.680- 19:24.300* :  At a memorial for Wadiya, Iman Nagreti, a Palestinian mother who lives in the neighborhood
*19:24.300- 19:26.280* :  described how the attack affected her.
*19:26.420- 19:29.160* :  It hits home. You don't feel safe now.
*19:29.160- 19:31.120* :  I live in Plainfield for over 20 years.
*19:31.780- 19:34.180* :  You don't feel safe. I don't feel safe.
*19:35.560- 19:39.080* :  Someone on Facebook going after me right now, calling me a terrorist.
*19:39.700- 19:43.360* :  Wadiya was born in the US while his mother, originally from the West Bank,
*19:43.360- 19:45.580* :  sought asylum in America 12 years ago.
*19:45.880- 19:49.460* :  Muslim organizations have warned of a spike in threats and hate calls
*19:49.460- 19:52.100* :  since last week's deadly Hamas attacks in Israel.
*19:52.660- 19:56.760* :  The director of the FBI, Christopher Ray, said communities had to remain vigilant
*19:56.760- 19:59.760* :  to protect against an increased threat of violence against Muslims.
*20:00.260- 20:03.880* :  There's no question we're seeing an increase in reported threats,
*20:03.880- 20:05.440* :  and we've got to be on the lookout.
*20:06.400- 20:11.060* :  Especially for lone actors who may take inspiration from recent events
*20:11.060- 20:13.580* :  to commit violence of their own.
*20:14.540- 20:18.520* :  FBI director Christopher Ray ending that report by Sarah Smith.
*20:19.480- 20:24.940* :  The Russian President Vladimir Putin is traveling to Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart
*20:25.480- 20:29.900* :  and to take part in Xi Jinping's pet project, The Belt and Road Forum.
*20:30.600- 20:33.700* :  With the Kremlin ever more isolated on the world stage,
*20:33.700- 20:37.540* :  the Chinese government has offered Russia significant moral backing,
*20:38.100- 20:42.660* :  refusing to criticise its invasion of Ukraine and saying it'll boost aid
*20:42.660- 20:46.900* :  to make up for the economic pain caused by Western impose sanctions.
*20:47.580- 20:49.480* :  Our China correspondent, Stephen McDonald,
*20:49.480- 20:52.340* :  traveled to the border region in Northeastern China
*20:52.800- 20:57.260* :  to find out if trade between the two countries has really increased that much.
*21:00.080- 21:06.400* :  Over the past 100 years, China and Russia have been close allies and also bitter enemies.
*21:06.960- 21:12.220* :  But in recent years Beijing and Moscow have found themselves being frozen out on the world stage,
*21:12.820- 21:17.120* :  so they've turned to one another for support and in an attempt to build
*21:17.120- 21:19.320* :  something of an alliance against the West.
*21:19.780- 21:23.840* :  To do this, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have declared to their people
*21:24.500- 21:27.920* :  that their countries now have a so-called no-limits partnership.
*21:28.660- 21:32.580* :  So if this partnership is real, you'd expect to notice it having an impact
*21:32.580- 21:36.460* :  in Northeastern China's halongjiang province, which borders Russia,
*21:36.960- 21:41.500* :  and where some places have been under both Chinese and Russian control, the different points.
*21:44.000- 21:46.400* :  Russia and China have a strong friendship.
*21:48.060- 21:51.760* :  Putin is a responsible leader, a man with a sense of justice.
*21:52.540- 21:55.560* :  Many local tourists have a good word to say about Russia's leader.
*21:56.260- 22:01.680* :  Putin is a man with iron fists, he's tough and tough, he's good.
*22:03.640- 22:07.360* :  I asked if this man knew why Russia's leader was at war with Ukraine.
*22:07.360- 22:07.840* :  I'd say, it's a way to be sure.
*22:08.340- 22:11.960* :  Ordinary people like us shouldn't comment on that.
*22:13.700- 22:16.340* :  Leaving Harbin and heading right up to the border,
*22:16.880- 22:21.300* :  you reach the point where halongjiang province is separated from Russia by a river.
*22:21.840- 22:25.720* :  Here, according to China's state media, the small city of He-Hua
*22:26.180- 22:29.000* :  has experienced a significant recent increase in trade.
*22:29.580- 22:33.240* :  But when we visit, this doesn't seem to be as healthy as has been claimed.
*22:35.000- 22:38.360* :  Standing on the cold, windy riverbank in He-Hua,
*22:39.180- 22:43.940* :  underneath a newly built flagpole with the Chinese flag flying,
*22:44.420- 22:47.480* :  you can see across the water and straight into Russia.
*22:48.260- 22:52.520* :  A nearby tour boat is playing some music in an attempt to attract customers,
*22:53.200- 22:56.180* :  but at the moment there aren't any and it's just sitting still.
*22:57.060- 23:00.880* :  Russia is so close, you could swim across the water to the blocks of flats where
*23:00.880- 23:06.260* :  Russian people are living, and so you'd think this would be the obvious place to build trade
*23:06.260- 23:10.500* :  between the two countries. But when you speak to business people on this side of the border,
*23:11.400- 23:16.460* :  many are saying that actually economic activity between the two communities hasn't been that
*23:16.520- 23:17.100* :  great lately.
*23:20.500- 23:23.040* :  Business isn't good, they're out enough tourists.
*23:23.780- 23:27.820* :  A woman now selling her goods out of the back of a car after the shopping center where she
*23:27.820- 23:32.860* :  had a stall closed because of a lack of customers says trade has been flat for years,
*23:33.440- 23:34.500* :  but even worse recently.
*23:36.400- 23:39.300* :  After COVID, the borders haven't been open for long.
*23:39.760- 23:41.780* :  There aren't enough Russians coming across.
*23:42.780- 23:45.000* :  They are poor and they are at war.
*23:46.700- 23:51.980* :  We did, however, find one group of people who are upbeat about Russia trying to trade in He-Hua.
*23:52.640- 23:55.400* :  The truck drivers waiting to enter the riverboat port.
*23:57.240- 24:02.520* :  I'm carrying soybeans, wheat and barley, all from Russia and it's busier than before.
*24:03.700- 24:09.840* :  I'm transporting sand and coal from Russia, others and moving containers with food.
*24:11.060- 24:16.840* :  China has been helping out an increasingly isolated Kremlin by piping more Russian natural
*24:16.980- 24:22.460* :  gas into He-Longjiang and there are great expectations regarding the potential for cooperation
*24:22.460- 24:29.500* :  in this region, but realistically, economic links have a long way to go for China's trade with
*24:29.500- 24:33.340* :  Russia to match what it currently has with many other countries.
*24:34.160- 24:34.920* :  Stephen McDonald
*24:35.960- 24:42.020* :  When the British Museum in London was forced to admit earlier this year that around 2000 items
*24:42.020- 24:47.740* :  had been stolen from its store rooms, many people were shocked and the story made headlines worldwide.
*24:47.860- 24:56.500* :  Now Glasgow Life, which runs museums in that city, has revealed its lost 1,750 items,
*24:57.120- 25:02.540* :  including Le Bourgeois de Calais, a rowdance sculpture worth almost four million dollars.
*25:03.180- 25:09.300* :  Jerome Leblay is the director of the Rodan Committee which publicises and catalogs the sculptors'
*25:09.300- 25:11.640* :  work. He's been speaking to Sarah Montague.
*25:12.080- 25:17.680* :  Actually, I found a letter from the Glasgow Museum from the 1980s saying that the work was
*25:17.920- 25:24.300* :  unlocated. The work was actually displayed after the Second World War, repatinated.
*25:24.300- 25:31.820* :  So they changed the colour, they applied brown paints on it and then it was damaged and destroyed.
*25:32.460- 25:38.480* :  So one of my colleagues at the Rodan Museum 10 years ago was in contact with the Glasgow Museum
*25:38.480- 25:40.020* :  and they said it was destroyed.
*25:40.240- 25:44.480* :  Now let's just be clear what we're talking about here. This is one of the plaster molds.
*25:45.320- 25:51.540* :  So just to make the things correctly, the bronze which is in front of the Parliament in London
*25:51.540- 26:00.020* :  is a bronze version of the group of six characters. So the burgers of Calais and Rodan decided
*26:00.100- 26:06.780* :  in his mind actually the group was supposed to be like a chain of walking men, not a group together.
*26:06.900- 26:14.700* :  So every character was important as a single character. The one in Glasgow is just one character.
*26:14.700- 26:19.860* :  So what do you think about the fact that as you understand it, it has been destroyed. Glasgow,
*26:19.860- 26:24.700* :  I think, is still just saying it's unlocated. I'm not familiar with the warehouses of Glasgow,
*26:24.700- 26:28.980* :  but the fact that it's too medium-high. But I would say that there is a
*26:28.980- 26:33.760* :  second plaster which is of another subject called San John the Batists,
*26:34.240- 26:39.640* :  which has been purchased in 1901 from Rodan at the same time as the Jean-Denis.
*26:39.920- 26:46.680* :  This plaster, San John the Batist, was also exhibited in 1949 and is currently missing
*26:46.680- 26:50.200* :  and according to the books of the Rodan Museum, destroyed.
*26:50.760- 26:54.280* :  What do you think of that? Because a lot of people might think that it's strange to understand
*26:54.280- 27:00.580* :  how that can happen. First of all, our vision of value of blasters and of
*27:00.580- 27:05.260* :  works of art generally speaking have changed over time. Blaster, as a medium itself,
*27:05.920- 27:11.280* :  was considered for centuries, had a poor medium and as a kind of lower medium.
*27:11.700- 27:14.900* :  So France won't be any better at looking after its artwork?
*27:15.200- 27:19.500* :  No, we have destroyed or lost a lot of blasters over the years.
*27:19.800- 27:24.240* :  Should we be just to block more relaxed about this? After what happened at the British Museum,
*27:24.240- 27:27.460* :  there will be some people going, can't we look after work better?
*27:27.640- 27:32.440* :  I would say considering that it happened almost 70 years ago, yes, we should be more relaxed.
*27:32.440- 27:37.540* :  But the fact that generally speaking, there are hundreds of thousands of works of art in museums.
*27:37.540- 27:44.140* :  Every work, every item is important for history. Human mistake happens, but we have to be more
*27:44.140- 27:49.920* :  and more careful. Well, Glasgow Life have told the BBC, they refuted the allegation
*27:49.920- 27:55.580* :  that Sajan de Baptiste was destroyed and said they have bits of it stored in pieces.
*27:56.360- 28:01.140* :  To Japan, where an airline had to lay on an extra plane because there were too many
*28:01.140- 28:07.840* :  sumo wrestlers on a flight, Iona Hampson has more. On average, sumo wrestlers weigh about 120
*28:07.860- 28:14.480* :  kilograms, almost double the weight of an average person in Japan. So there was concern when
*28:14.480- 28:21.120* :  staff at Japan Airlines saw a group of 27 professional sumo wrestlers on the passenger list of one
*28:21.120- 28:26.880* :  of its planes, including some of the country's heaviest men. The main worry was the fuel capacity
*28:26.880- 28:32.540* :  needed to get the athletes to a sports festival, from Tokyo to the southern island of Amami-ishima
*28:32.540- 28:38.440* :  via Osaka. As the airport they were flying into was very small, the airline said it had to take
*28:38.440- 28:44.340* :  the extremely unusual step of putting on an extra plane to ease the load. Unlike other
*28:44.340- 28:48.560* :  sports like wrestling and boxing, there were no weight divisions for sumo wrestling.
*28:49.120- 28:54.120* :  The heavier you are, the more force an opponent has to exert to get you moving and push you out
*28:54.120- 28:59.880* :  of the ring. The heaviest sumo wrestler of all time was Russian-born Aurora, who retired in 2018.
*29:00.020- 29:05.700* :  At his peak, he weighed over 292 kilograms. Iona Hampson.
*29:08.520- 29:13.400* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later,
*29:13.400- 29:18.380* :  if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
