*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:17.060* :  by advertising. This is a special edition of the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service
*00:17.060- 00:25.360* :  on the conflict between Israel and Hamas. I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Saturday
*00:25.360- 00:31.400* :  the 28th of October, these are our main stories. Israel's military operations and Gaza have expanded.
*00:34.920- 00:40.900* :  Dozens of rocket attacks hit across the strip overnight and Israel says it's engaged Hamas fighters
*00:41.220- 00:46.000* :  on the ground. Israel's war now is against Hamas, not against Palestinian people and not against
*00:46.000- 00:49.600* :  the people of Gaza. That's why Israel is making efforts to minimize civilian casualties.
*00:50.420- 00:54.780* :  Aid organisations say internet and phone communications were cut to Gaza.
*00:54.860- 01:00.280* :  So we have one million children in Gaza to whom we need urgently to get a supplies, water supplies,
*01:00.280- 01:05.340* :  medicine without contact with our office and staff on the ground. It becomes that much more difficult.
*01:08.040- 01:13.800* :  There has been a significant escalation in Israel's military actions in Gaza. It came just hours
*01:13.800- 01:19.540* :  after the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a resolution calling for a humanitarian
*01:19.540- 01:25.140* :  truce there. Overnight from Friday into Saturday there were perhaps the most sustained Israeli
*01:25.140- 01:32.140* :  bombardments on Gaza since the Hamas attacks on October the 7th. The Israeli army says it's also
*01:32.140- 01:38.300* :  expanded its ground operations in several parts of the strip. Daniel Hagaris is from the Israel
*01:38.300- 01:48.200* :  defense forces. During the night our general security surfaces and the IDF targeted killing various
*01:48.200- 01:56.280* :  senior operatives of the Hamas, including the senior official who was responsible for the
*01:56.280- 02:04.260* :  preparation of the massacre. And we have continued killing various brigade officers and others.
*02:04.260- 02:13.340* :  They are literally the spearhead of the Hamas operatives. And we see this as good progress
*02:13.420- 02:22.180* :  for what we are aiming for against a much more weakened enemy. The forces are still in the field,
*02:22.180- 02:30.860* :  in the arena and continue. We have no casualties after the activities that we carried out tonight.
*02:30.860- 02:35.260* :  We're continuing to preserve the security of our forces.
*02:36.360- 02:42.620* :  Elon Levy is a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He said the Israeli
*02:42.620- 02:47.040* :  army was doing everything in its power to avoid civilian injuries and deaths.
*02:47.360- 02:52.660* :  Israel's war now is against Hamas. Israel's war is against the terror organization that declared war
*02:52.660- 02:56.560* :  on us on October 7th, not against the Palestinian people and not against the people of Gaza.
*02:57.120- 03:01.520* :  That's why Israel is making efforts to minimize civilian casualties, despite Hamas's best efforts
*03:01.520- 03:06.520* :  to maximize them in the Gaza Strip. For example, two weeks ago we gave Palestinians in the northern
*03:06.520- 03:12.460* :  Gaza Strip 24 hours to move out of the northern Gaza Strip temporarily for their own safety to the
*03:12.500- 03:17.640* :  south. Because in northern Gaza that is where Hamas has embedded its terror infrastructure under
*03:17.640- 03:22.880* :  their homes, under their schools, under their hospitals. Internet and phone communications have
*03:22.880- 03:28.660* :  been cut in Gaza and that is worrying aid organizations. More on the humanitarian situation in
*03:28.660- 03:33.560* :  Gaza in a moment. But first is our correspondent. We're a Davis with this update from Jerusalem.
*03:34.140- 03:38.620* :  Anybody who saw and heard what happened last night will have gathered quite quickly that this
*03:38.620- 03:46.100* :  was by far the biggest night of Israeli action over Gaza, shelling and using aircraft to hit dozens,
*03:46.100- 03:52.100* :  hundreds of targets in the Gaza Strip. For the specifics, the Israeli said they hit about 150
*03:52.100- 03:57.820* :  targets, mainly tunnels, which they of course say Hamas uses for commander control centres, for
*03:57.820- 04:02.720* :  communication centres and even for training. They also specifically said they eliminated several
*04:02.720- 04:11.220* :  Hamas commanders. One commander particularly responsible for aerial attacks using drones and
*04:11.220- 04:18.140* :  microlights to cross into Israel on October 7th. So specific targets, and this is the Israeli
*04:18.140- 04:22.560* :  narrative that this is a targeted operation. It's an increased operation, it's a more intensive
*04:22.560- 04:28.760* :  operation, but these are targeted Hamas assets they are hitting. The problem of course is that
*04:29.340- 04:33.780* :  such as the intensity of the targeting, such as the intensity of the bombing, that there is
*04:33.780- 04:39.260* :  considerable collateral damage. We've now heard from our correspondent in Gaza that according to
*04:39.260- 04:44.620* :  the Hamas run health ministry, there have now been almost 8,000 people killed in Gaza. Many of
*04:44.620- 04:50.240* :  those are children, nearly all of them civilians, and the devastation on the ground can only be,
*04:51.180- 04:54.420* :  we don't really know just yet because communication with Gaza is really problematic,
*04:54.420- 05:00.100* :  but given the intensity of the bombing last night, it was a severe military operation that
*05:00.100- 05:04.420* :  will have led to many many casualties. And where it wasn't just increased bombing activity,
*05:04.420- 05:08.540* :  there were land incursions as well. Yeah, this is a very important point as well. Of course,
*05:08.540- 05:13.780* :  we'd seen limited land incursions about three times this week, once from the sea and twice
*05:13.900- 05:19.100* :  over the land border, but those were quite limited. Small numbers of tanks, bulldozers,
*05:19.520- 05:23.940* :  perhaps preparing the way for what happened last night, but last night there were a lot of tanks,
*05:23.940- 05:29.340* :  a lot of soldiers went into Gaza. There was reportedly hand-to-hand fighting, perhaps even casualties
*05:29.340- 05:35.600* :  on both sides. And one thing the Israelis did say in that briefing this morning that the I quote,
*05:35.600- 05:40.480* :  troops are still in the field and continue the war. Now, does that mean that Israeli troops have
*05:40.480- 05:45.700* :  stayed within Gaza, perhaps in advanced positions either to mop up after what happened overnight,
*05:46.260- 05:51.940* :  or preparing these advanced positions when the tanks again will go in, perhaps into the
*05:51.940- 05:57.080* :  built-up areas of Gaza, because Israel's aim, unlike previous wars, isn't just to weaken her mass,
*05:57.080- 06:02.160* :  isn't just to give her mass a bloody nose, after what happened on October the 7th. This
*06:02.660- 06:07.900* :  Israel's stated aim is to completely wipe out and annihilate her mass as a fighting force.
*06:08.380- 06:13.160* :  And that means that troops will have to go in, tanks will have to go in in a much greater number
*06:13.160- 06:17.080* :  than we've seen previously. And perhaps last night was the start of that, especially troops,
*06:17.080- 06:23.040* :  Israeli troops have stayed within Gaza. Was this the start of an invasion? Was this a limited
*06:23.040- 06:27.700* :  invasion in its own right? Then these semantics don't matter, because the intensity of the bombing
*06:27.700- 06:32.620* :  from the air is having a dramatic effect, of course, on the people of Gaza. We're a Davis.
*06:33.200- 06:36.800* :  Well, at the time of recording this podcast, most internet and phone communications,
*06:36.800- 06:42.060* :  are still cut to Gaza, making it very difficult for aid agencies to contact their staff there.
*06:42.200- 06:46.360* :  Jeremy Hopkins is the UNICEF representative in Cairo, Egypt.
*06:46.600- 06:52.600* :  They have several dozen colleagues of ours in Gaza working day and night to bring assistance
*06:52.600- 06:59.680* :  to vulnerable children. It was around dusk last night that UNICEF lost touch, and we're desperately
*06:59.680- 07:03.880* :  trying to reconnect with them to find out if they're safe, and to continue to support them to do
*07:03.880- 07:09.220* :  their work for children. We have one million children in Gaza to whom we need urgently to get
*07:09.220- 07:15.220* :  supplies, water supplies, medicine health supplies, food and nutrition supplies, and without
*07:15.220- 07:19.720* :  contact with our office and staff on the ground, it becomes that much more difficult and that much
*07:19.720- 07:25.060* :  more terrifying. I mean, our hearts go out to them. They're doing amazing work under these
*07:25.060- 07:29.980* :  difficult circumstances, and now they have one more major impediment, which means they can't
*07:29.980- 07:37.040* :  communicate with us and amongst each other the quickest way to provide safe humanitarian support
*07:37.040- 07:41.780* :  to vulnerable children is for an immediate ceasefire. Well, for more on what's happening in Gaza,
*07:41.780- 07:47.980* :  our correspondent, Rushdie Abel Alouf, spoke to my colleague Anna Foster via a satellite truck
*07:47.980- 07:54.940* :  in Kanunis. It's about 13-14 hours, Gaza's without communication, without internet, and without
*07:54.940- 08:01.760* :  mobile signal. The Palestinian health minister just issued a statement saying that about 400
*08:01.760- 08:07.120* :  people who are killed overnight in the Israeli air strikes in the north. Israel said that they have
*08:07.120- 08:14.100* :  expand their operation, especially in Gaza City and the north here in Kanunis. Also, there was
*08:14.580- 08:20.720* :  many air strikes overnight with about 20 people killed about 15 targets around this area and around
*08:20.720- 08:25.660* :  the middle camps. People are really worried since the Israeli is cutting all the communication.
*08:27.460- 08:32.280* :  People can't communicate with their relatives, with their friends in Gaza City and the north,
*08:32.440- 08:37.880* :  and people who are really in panic, also people in the streets. Today lists people in the streets
*08:37.880- 08:43.500* :  than yesterday. People are afraid of the next stage of the operation. They believe that cutting
*08:43.500- 08:51.760* :  the communication. This is the first time ever since Hamas took over Gaza and four wars before.
*08:51.760- 09:01.440* :  We haven't seen Israel completely cutting the communication with Gaza. The humanitarian situation
*09:01.440- 09:09.520* :  is also getting worse and worse with Israel allowing food and medicine. I have seen people struggling
*09:09.520- 09:16.320* :  to find water. Here in the hospital people are struggling to find fuel to run the generator
*09:16.320- 09:23.160* :  and work in the hospital. The medical crews are struggling. The ambulance services is almost
*09:24.180- 09:29.640* :  shut down since the morning. They say we don't know where to go and how to communicate with the people
*09:29.640- 09:36.900* :  after an in-strike. They wait for any news from the people on the ground and then they move
*09:37.440- 09:42.640* :  quickly to the scene and back with casualties here in the hospital. So it's a real catastrophic
*09:43.420- 09:49.080* :  situation. I'm hoping that you can still hear me. I know that you're using a satellite phone
*09:49.080- 09:54.300* :  there to hear the questions. How are you managing to find out what else is going on in the strip?
*09:54.300- 09:59.000* :  Because obviously we're at the northern end on the Israeli side and we can hear continuing
*09:59.000- 10:04.980* :  bombardment going on throughout the morning. What are you hearing about about the intensification
*10:05.340- 10:11.640* :  and the impact it's having there in Gaza? Yeah communication is extremely difficult and
*10:11.640- 10:15.560* :  getting confirmation is extremely difficult. A lot of trauma is a lot of conflicting
*10:15.560- 10:22.700* :  reporting about what's happened but we are sure from different sources on the area. There is still
*10:22.700- 10:29.380* :  some people who have like Israeli mobile numbers who still could communicate. I managed to get
*10:29.380- 10:35.700* :  some information from people in the northeast and west where the four area that Israel is expanding
*10:35.700- 10:42.260* :  the operation. They said they are not aware of any tanks near the like resident or the highly
*10:42.260- 10:48.600* :  populated area. So most likely the tanks are still operating within the border area one or one and
*10:48.600- 10:55.220* :  a half kilometers from the border area but what the people are noticing is that non-stop Israeli
*10:55.220- 11:01.680* :  air strike in the area. They said this is for the first time ever they have seen this scale of
*11:01.680- 11:11.640* :  of exiblusion. Huge black huge fire on the on the sky. Someone told local radio station here I
*11:11.640- 11:16.240* :  was listening to a local radio station. Someone said it's like a hill. What's happened
*11:16.240- 11:22.600* :  last night in the north and in Gaza? That was Rushdie Abu al-Uth in Gaza.
*11:24.160- 11:29.080* :  In Turkey President Erdogan's political party is hosting what it's calling the great Palestine
*11:29.080- 11:35.180* :  rally in Istanbul. This Erdogan himself is due to make a speech on stage where he's expected to
*11:35.180- 11:40.740* :  condemn what he's already described as the murder and madness of Israel's response to the October
*11:40.740- 11:47.140* :  7th attacks. He's also called Hamas not a terror organization but a group fighting for liberation.
*11:47.760- 11:52.060* :  Our reporter Victoria Craig is at the rally. There are several hundred people that have started to
*11:52.060- 11:57.640* :  assemble. We're at an old disused airport that the president frequently uses for sort of his
*11:57.640- 12:02.820* :  set piece events. The last event that he held here was just ahead of the May election. His final
*12:02.820- 12:07.840* :  rally here in Istanbul and this area was packed. It was tens of hundreds of thousands of people gathered
*12:08.280- 12:14.060* :  to hear him speak and the AKP his party is expecting they say a million people to attend today's
*12:14.060- 12:19.120* :  rally. There's free public transport today here in Istanbul and tomorrow worth noting that tomorrow
*12:19.120- 12:24.340* :  is the centenary of the Turkish Republic so that's also designed to get people sort of out and
*12:24.340- 12:29.540* :  about to various things across the city but certainly here to the rally is you know people are
*12:29.540- 12:34.260* :  taking public buses and trains to get here. There's a steady stream of people I can see coming in
*12:34.900- 12:39.600* :  just to my left here. They're carrying huge Turkish flags lots of Palestinian flags as well
*12:39.660- 12:44.900* :  but so far the mood here is fairly calm at this hour and yesterday we were hearing
*12:44.900- 12:50.540* :  President Erdogan was saying look Hamas is not a terror organization. Many Western countries
*12:50.540- 12:57.120* :  including the UK and the EU think that it is. They Mr. Erdogan saying that it's a group fighting
*12:57.120- 13:03.580* :  for liberation. What is the assessment a lot of people in Turkey that you speak to are
*13:03.980- 13:09.680* :  about the situation that going on in Gaza? Well we've seen a lot of protests around
*13:10.140- 13:14.180* :  around Turkey not just here in Istanbul but in the capital Ankara where I'm usually based and all
*13:14.180- 13:20.960* :  across the country shortly after the October 7th attack we saw the the US operations in Adana
*13:20.960- 13:26.500* :  briefly closed because of protests there you know the certainly lots of protesters have gathered
*13:26.500- 13:32.320* :  outside the Israeli and the US embassies those two countries you know really seen as sort of a
*13:32.320- 13:37.200* :  united front I guess you could say in this conflict and so people have taken to the streets and
*13:37.200- 13:42.160* :  haven't you know been hesitant really to express their frustration with the situation and the
*13:42.160- 13:47.420* :  crisis there. For his part the president has said that this rally is designed to draw attention
*13:47.420- 13:52.240* :  to Israeli brutality as he's called it and support the cause of free Palestine so that's certainly
*13:52.240- 13:57.840* :  the message that we're expecting to hear from him today. Oh Victoria Craig with a current conflict
*13:57.840- 14:04.020* :  has rekindled awareness and passions about the Israel-Palestinian question across the Arab and
*14:04.020- 14:10.440* :  Muslim world. On Friday Arab diplomats and those from many other nations supported a UN resolution
*14:10.440- 14:16.460* :  calling for a ceasefire. Well my Thompson is our Arab affairs editor. Where is the public mood
*14:16.460- 14:23.060* :  at the moment across the Arab world? I would say that very much anti-Israel in many many countries
*14:23.820- 14:28.880* :  in the region over the last 24 hours we've seen widespread protests in the West Bank,
*14:28.880- 14:35.580* :  occupied West Bank for instance in Amman in Jordan something like 200,000 people on Friday
*14:35.580- 14:44.880* :  joined a rally there also in the Yemeni capital Sinar in Lebanon and in Iraq and also in Iraq we've
*14:44.880- 14:52.200* :  had the religious leader Maktada Al-Sada calling for the country to close the U.S. Embassy there
*14:53.060- 14:59.040* :  because of its support for Israel. By the way Iraq of course does not recognise Israel so it's
*14:59.040- 15:03.820* :  even more pointed. And then the situation we heard there Mr Erdogan making a distinction
*15:05.040- 15:11.700* :  over Hamas and what it is and what it isn't. How is Hamas proceeded? Does Hamas have sympathy
*15:11.700- 15:15.960* :  amongst the public in across the Arab world or is it specifically the Palestinians?
*15:16.740- 15:21.820* :  No I think there is a lot of sympathy for Hamas now anyway after what's been going on in
*15:21.820- 15:27.500* :  Gaza there's really little little gray anymore a little more differentiation between the sort of
*15:27.500- 15:33.000* :  things you are mentioning in the description of Hamas and this is particularly so in countries with
*15:33.000- 15:43.040* :  large Palestinian minorities of course like like Lebanon but also in Yemen and Iraq where people
*15:43.040- 15:49.640* :  talk about this open air prison in Gaza they talk about all the the continued settlements in the
*15:49.640- 15:55.840* :  occupied West Bank attacks by settlers and also the many deaths of Palestinians at the hands of
*15:55.840- 16:02.600* :  the Israeli military particularly over the last year. And if and when we see a wider incursion
*16:03.040- 16:10.920* :  by Israeli ground troops into Gaza one has to assume that the death rate will go up amongst Palestinians
*16:11.760- 16:19.120* :  in flaming feelings yet further. Absolutely. This feeling about Hamas that we were talking about
*16:19.120- 16:25.620* :  and the general anti-Israel feeling has really grown since what happened three weeks ago these
*16:25.620- 16:32.440* :  radio response to that and it's growing more and more intense. That was Mike Thompson. You are
*16:32.440- 16:37.780* :  listening to a special edition of the Global News Podcast as we mentioned Israel's military operations
*16:37.780- 16:44.000* :  in Gaza have expanded or dozens of rocket attacks hit across the strip overnight and Israel says
*16:44.000- 16:50.320* :  it engaged Hamas fighters on the ground. Jeremy Bowen is our international editor and has this
*16:50.320- 16:55.240* :  analysis. Well what appears to be happening is that they're concentrating on the northern part
*16:55.580- 17:01.420* :  of the Gaza Strip. There's a place called Beethoven and pushing down a little bit further south
*17:01.420- 17:07.080* :  from there. I've been trying to get more information out of the Israeli army this morning and they
*17:07.080- 17:10.980* :  not adding anything to what they were saying last night which is effectively that they are
*17:11.540- 17:17.260* :  upping the tempo of their operations and people have seen and people from just outside Gaza have
*17:17.260- 17:24.600* :  filmed it this very very large bombardment. I mean you can hear it for miles and miles around the
*17:24.600- 17:31.800* :  extent of the explosions but I think right now as I understand it the army the Israeli army is still
*17:31.800- 17:37.540* :  in there that they will be trying to clear out these tunnels. They'll probably have special forces
*17:38.220- 17:44.980* :  spotting targets for the Air Force. Question mark about tanks, they're more vulnerable in daylight so
*17:44.980- 17:50.020* :  maybe they might pull some of those back. But I don't think we should get too hung up on
*17:50.020- 17:54.780* :  definitions of all of this because I think the assumption was when there was that enormous
*17:54.780- 18:02.280* :  military build up, fully mobilized army, 300,000 plus reservists called up that there would be
*18:02.780- 18:07.780* :  some kind of all fronts invasion. I think what they seem to be doing is to be doing
*18:07.780- 18:13.620* :  it slice by slice. I think you can probably call this I don't know if it's a very extended
*18:13.620- 18:20.080* :  raid or whether it is the ground offensive but it seems very like a very large military operation
*18:20.080- 18:25.800* :  to me so without getting as I say to worked up about about what title we give it it seems very
*18:25.800- 18:31.480* :  much like a ground offensive yeah. That was Jeremy Bowen. Let us get more on the situation on the
*18:31.480- 18:38.440* :  ground in Garza now. These paramedics are working in the southern Garza city of Hanunis. They
*18:38.440- 18:45.160* :  describe the challenges carrying out their duties. While searching for survivors and casualties,
*18:45.160- 18:50.480* :  I discovered my brother among the martyrs. This has become a part of our work as paramedics in
*18:50.480- 18:55.840* :  these circumstances. The possibility of finding my brother, my father, or my wife martyred.
*18:56.220- 19:03.180* :  46 ambulances have been damaged in the Garza strip. 24 of those are completely out of service
*19:03.180- 19:09.120* :  and the other 22 were partially hit and have been repaired and are functional. We no longer have
*19:09.120- 19:14.980* :  any body bags in the ambulances and we're facing difficulties in transporting decomposing corpses.
*19:15.620- 19:20.160* :  We're a Davis is our correspondent in Jerusalem. I also tend to bring us up to date with the latest.
*19:20.700- 19:26.120* :  While Israel is completely unapologetic about its operations, of course, Israel wants the
*19:26.120- 19:31.660* :  world to remember and to remind the world that this is all about retaliating and defeating Hamas
*19:31.660- 19:37.840* :  after what happened on October 7th and Hamas gunmen. Thousands of them crossed the Israeli border
*19:38.000- 19:44.040* :  and murdered killed 1400 people. Israel says that this isn't a normal operation against Hamas,
*19:44.080- 19:48.480* :  the likes of which we've seen five times over the last 15 years. This is a war in which
*19:48.480- 19:54.140* :  Israel's aim is to completely defeat Hamas and what happened overnight fits in with that narrative.
*19:54.140- 19:59.000* :  Of course, there have been ridiculously heavy bombing. I say ridiculously, I mean, it's the
*19:59.000- 20:05.040* :  highest level of bombing we've seen every night and every day. These huge levels of explosions and
*20:05.040- 20:10.980* :  bombs in Garza prepare the way Israel says for some form of ground offensive. Now, what happened
*20:11.040- 20:16.300* :  overnight that was different to previous nights is that large numbers of Israeli troops and tanks
*20:16.300- 20:20.600* :  went in on the ground into Garza much more than we've seen before. It's not an invasion because
*20:20.600- 20:25.220* :  most of them withdrew, although we have learned this afternoon that Israel did apparently leave
*20:25.220- 20:30.960* :  some troops on the ground, either in military terms and mopping up after the military operation
*20:31.400- 20:37.360* :  or perhaps creating advanced bases. So this full-scale invasion that we're expecting in the coming
*20:37.360- 20:43.560* :  days might well happen. But Israel, on that point, is very clear. It says it has specific military
*20:43.560- 20:48.260* :  objectives. This isn't blanket bombing. It says this isn't just bombing Garza for the sake of it.
*20:48.560- 20:54.640* :  Israel says it has military objectives to destroy Hamas tunnels, the command centres underneath Garza
*20:54.640- 20:59.940* :  City and the rest of the strip, and also to specifically target individual Hamas leaders. And it
*20:59.940- 21:06.240* :  said overnight, it succeeded in eliminating in Israeli terms several senior Hamas figures. So
*21:06.240- 21:11.840* :  that is the the number of the Israeli military operation. Where are you mentioned one of the main
*21:11.840- 21:18.460* :  aims is to destroy those tunnels which are widespread across particularly northern parts of Garza.
*21:18.740- 21:23.500* :  The geography is incredibly difficult, though, isn't it? Because Israel is saying that some of those
*21:23.500- 21:31.380* :  tunnels are underneath a very large hospital where hundreds, if not thousands of Garzans, are
*21:31.380- 21:36.840* :  sheltering. Yeah, that's a difficult one. Israel has maintained for a long time that the
*21:36.840- 21:42.620* :  Shefa Hospital, which is the main hospital in Garza, as you say, not only are casualties treated
*21:42.620- 21:47.920* :  there, but several people have been seeking refuge. Israel has alleged for a long time that Hamas uses
*21:48.300- 21:53.220* :  tunnels and rooms underneath the hospital as a command centre. We've seen no proof of that. There
*21:53.220- 21:59.280* :  was an Israeli military briefing earlier this week, which purported to show images and proof
*21:59.280- 22:03.980* :  of that. But these were computer generated images. They weren't actual real images of what Israel
*22:03.980- 22:09.820* :  says is present under the hospital. Nonetheless, Israel maintains that Hamas fighters and commanders
*22:10.340- 22:17.380* :  use the civilians as in effect as shells to protect them. They live amongst the civilians,
*22:17.380- 22:22.440* :  which is why Israel says that sometimes civilian areas are getting hit. Eight agencies say
*22:22.820- 22:27.540* :  the net effect of all this is that thousands of people are dying. There are at least 600,
*22:27.540- 22:33.480* :  if not 700,000 internally displaced people in Garza. People who the Israelis ordered to leave
*22:33.480- 22:38.140* :  northern Garza have gone to the south. And in those areas, there's still being shell, there's still
*22:38.140- 22:42.840* :  being bomb, there's still being killed. Khan Unis, for example, the big town in southern Garza.
*22:43.360- 22:46.800* :  In theory, it should be safe, but it's clearly not. That was Wira Davis.
*22:48.340- 22:54.300* :  Relatives of more than 200 Israelis being held hostage in Garza have expressed alarm at the
*22:54.300- 22:59.840* :  intensification of the fighting. A statement from the hostages and missing families for them
*22:59.840- 23:05.640* :  demanded an immediate meeting with the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister
*23:05.640- 23:12.580* :  to discuss their safety. Noam Syge's mother Adah Syge was abducted on the 7th of October after
*23:12.580- 23:19.260* :  Hamas gunman stormed the near Oz cubits near the border with Garza. Noam grew up in the cubits,
*23:19.260- 23:24.180* :  but now lives in London. He spoke to Michelle Hussein about his reaction to the events overnight.
*23:24.840- 23:31.780* :  Exactly three weeks ago to now. We're sitting sick, worried with loads of messages coming from
*23:32.180- 23:39.620* :  what started to appear that happened in Israel. And I think for the last three weeks,
*23:39.620- 23:49.900* :  21 days exactly, we are worried since that nothing, you know, knowing is a psychological
*23:51.620- 23:59.100* :  torture, not hearing. It's just one big void of so many emotions.
*23:59.700- 24:05.740* :  And as you watch these scenes and it's clear that Israel wants to get the hostages back,
*24:05.740- 24:09.980* :  the question is how, when you hear calls for a ceasefire, what do you think?
*24:10.460- 24:16.340* :  I'm not a politician and I'm not a military guy and I think that the only way to stop this,
*24:17.720- 24:25.840* :  is the quickest way to stop this is to get the 229 hostages plus 100 missing back now.
*24:26.280- 24:30.420* :  But when you hear an Israeli official adviser to the Prime Minister say the way to do that is
*24:30.420- 24:33.380* :  to beef up the military operations, do you support that?
*24:33.620- 24:38.900* :  You know, I don't know if I can be more worried from the last three weeks.
*24:39.500- 24:43.260* :  And in the way that we are, you know, there's no sleep and it's constantly
*24:44.000- 24:48.240* :  trying to do everything in our power to bring them back home. So we are worried to
*24:48.900- 24:51.260* :  I thought to the max, I'm more worried now.
*24:52.060- 24:56.940* :  That was Norm Sagi. Well, let's take a broader look now at the impact of the conflict.
*24:56.940- 25:03.340* :  In London, the city's police have revealed a startling increase in anti-Semitic hate crime since
*25:03.760- 25:10.280* :  Hamas's attacks on October the 7th. And Israel's response to it out from 28 this time last
*25:10.280- 25:17.180* :  year to 408 reported incidents. There was also a sharp rise in Islamophobic hate crime
*25:17.180- 25:23.640* :  up from 65 to 174 incidents for the period between the 1st and the 18th of October.
*25:24.680- 25:27.960* :  Well, for London's Jews, it has been an especially unsettling time.
*25:27.960- 25:33.100* :  Johnny Diamond has been to one of Britain's biggest Jewish communities to hear how life has
*25:33.100- 25:38.320* :  changed since the October the 7th attacks. And awarding his report does include a smattering
*25:38.320- 25:40.640* :  of language that some listeners may find upsetting.
*25:44.260- 25:51.100* :  In Stamford Hill, North London, Groszinski's bakery is bustling, filled not just, but mostly
*25:51.100- 25:56.180* :  with Orthodox Jews. Here on the shelves are bagels and rugelach,
*25:56.180- 26:01.680* :  halibred and biscuits. Once there were more than 20 Groszinski's across London.
*26:02.040- 26:05.700* :  Now, there are two. This one run by Voldi Kuba's time.
*26:06.040- 26:10.260* :  There is definitely a increase in anti-Semitic hate crime, what I see.
*26:10.980- 26:16.980* :  So we've had incidents where the doors open and people were just saying like abuse,
*26:16.980- 26:22.940* :  you old Jews go back, a friend of mine just told me that his child walked through
*26:22.940- 26:26.460* :  Tim on the street and suddenly he got a slap on his face. Literally like that,
*26:26.500- 26:29.020* :  just somebody went past and gave him a slap.
*26:29.440- 26:36.680* :  And Voldi, as far as you are concerned, this is new because there's been anti-Semitism in London
*26:36.680- 26:42.200* :  as long as there have been Jews in London. But you think there has been a significant shift
*26:42.840- 26:45.040* :  since the terrible events of a few weeks ago.
*26:45.880- 26:51.380* :  There's definitely been an increase. I must say as well that we have Muslim staff
*26:52.120- 26:57.560* :  and we're very happy. We never had, don't have no issue with them and we have a lot of Muslim
*26:57.560- 27:00.060* :  customers here and we never had an issue with them.
*27:00.980- 27:05.680* :  Customers, too, have tales to tell of a sharp change in me.
*27:06.520- 27:13.100* :  I was going on the underground and somebody came up to me and he said, you bastard.
*27:14.600- 27:18.400* :  And I was scared of him because I'm a small person.
*27:18.960- 27:23.040* :  I'd rather would have answered him that I have no connection to the whole thing there,
*27:23.040- 27:27.320* :  just like he has no connection to that side. I've got the connection to this side.
*27:27.740- 27:35.600* :  I did see like red paint on trees in my area. It makes me a bit not safe.
*27:35.760- 27:39.660* :  Like I feel like sometimes I'm just a bit scared, like, you know, anything can happen.
*27:40.940- 27:47.300* :  You walk round Stamford Hill and I mean, apart from the fact that it's a lovely peaceful
*27:47.300- 27:52.900* :  neighborhood, what you really notice is this is a Jewish neighborhood in particular the number
*27:52.900- 27:58.120* :  of Orthodox Jews, the long dark coats and the conservative clothing.
*27:58.140- 28:05.780* :  This is a place where herady Jews in particular are comfortable but also very conspicuous.
*28:06.300- 28:10.100* :  They've come into the playground, the central playground, sprayed this marquee which
*28:10.100- 28:15.200* :  the children use. They sprayed all these windows, this, this front door and all these four windows
*28:15.200- 28:16.040* :  you can see of that building.
*28:16.040- 28:20.500* :  Joel Friedman is from the Pinter Trust which speaks for Orthodox Jews.
*28:20.560- 28:24.280* :  We're at Lubavitch Senior Girls School in Stamford Hill.
*28:24.780- 28:29.860* :  There's no specific threats we're told by the police and security services and that is encouraging
*28:29.920- 28:34.440* :  and we are happy to see life continuous usual but we are very visible and people are very conscious
*28:34.440- 28:38.320* :  of that. Everyone can feel the stress and the anxiety just bubbling under the surface.
*28:38.540- 28:45.720* :  Jewish community has lived in Britain pretty happily and pretty successfully for decades now.
*28:46.540- 28:52.240* :  Are there times when you hear about abuse, when you hear about attacks, when you see the
*28:52.240- 28:57.900* :  paint sprayed on a school here, where you think is this still a comfortable place for us to live?
*28:58.980- 29:03.840* :  There's all these things happen. The community is anxious and stressed. We feel very British
*29:04.260- 29:11.740* :  and proud to be British and we don't give up easily. That hate and imbalance and that has to stop.
*29:12.400- 29:17.780* :  I'm just going to pop inside the school now to meet Rabbi Sterner who's a director and trustee
*29:17.780- 29:24.520* :  of the Visionate School and on the handle here, there's still the remnants of the red paint that
*29:24.520- 29:28.860* :  was splashed on the doors. The girls came in the morning to sort of red paint,
*29:29.680- 29:37.120* :  wet paint and the new is something bringing them not good so basically they had a lot of girls
*29:37.120- 29:42.960* :  they didn't come back to school, bringing them a lot of anxieties and the teachers as well.
*29:43.300- 29:47.220* :  In the Jewish community we have a lot of connections with the Muslim community in the area.
*29:47.620- 29:52.880* :  We are very close. We don't feel that because of something happened in the world between Israel
*29:52.880- 30:00.080* :  and Gaza or any other issue, we don't need to suffer from it and we feel that the government
*30:00.080- 30:05.540* :  will protect us as well. That was Rabbi Sterner, a director and trustee of the Visionate School in
*30:05.540- 30:11.400* :  Sanford Hill and in that report by Johnny Diamond. Let's go back to what's happening on the ground
*30:11.400- 30:16.800* :  in Gaza. Israel says its troops and tanks remain in the strip after launching a major
*30:16.800- 30:23.260* :  incursion to fight Hamas. It also says the Air Force struck 150 underground targets overnight
*30:23.260- 30:29.660* :  into Saturday. The scenes in Gaza have been described as panic and chaos. Jonathan Marcus
*30:30.200- 30:34.860* :  is an independent defense analyst. It's a much bigger version of what we've seen in recent days
*30:34.860- 30:40.360* :  and as far as we know for the moment one of the big differences that Israeli forces haven't
*30:40.580- 30:46.480* :  withdrawn on the ground they seem to still be there. Now whether this is a precursor to a
*30:46.480- 30:54.260* :  gradually building up of a ground operation step by step we just don't know but as I say it's a very
*30:54.260- 31:00.540* :  very significant increase in the military pressure and the military operations by the Israeli
*31:00.540- 31:05.940* :  defense force compared with what we've seen up to now. And Jonathan remind us what Israel is
*31:05.940- 31:12.360* :  trying to achieve with this strategy at and the broader picture. Well it's it's general rhetorical
*31:12.360- 31:18.900* :  sense it's trying to destroy Hamas's ability to threaten Israel in the future and we believe to
*31:18.900- 31:25.600* :  try and destroy Hamas's ability to govern the Gaza strip. The problem is that's the rhetoric
*31:25.600- 31:34.000* :  the reality on the ground raises more questions than are answered. How competent will the Israelis
*31:34.000- 31:40.880* :  be in dismantling Hamas militarily? How long might that take? If they were to be successful
*31:40.880- 31:47.120* :  you know setting aside for a moment be the terrible human catastrophe in Gaza itself
*31:47.120- 31:51.720* :  who is going to run Gaza afterwards and it's interesting you know because the Americans
*31:51.720- 31:56.400* :  sent a very senior military team including a US Marine Corps general who's had a lot of experience
*31:56.400- 32:03.520* :  of urban fighting in Iraq and elsewhere Lieutenant General James Glenn. He went out to Israel and
*32:03.520- 32:08.260* :  all of the indications we're getting from the Americans is that they weren't hugely impressed with
*32:08.260- 32:14.180* :  Israel's military plans. They thought that they left too many of these questions unanswered.
*32:15.000- 32:20.240* :  So look we're left in a position now with three big sets of questions, four questions.
*32:20.240- 32:26.460* :  How much damage is going to be done to the civilian population in Gaza? What's the US response
*32:26.460- 32:32.140* :  going to be if this battle on the ground continues to escalate? What's going to happen of course
*32:32.140- 32:38.620* :  to the Israeli hostages and finally at fundamental concern of the Americans? The fear of this more
*32:38.620- 32:45.380* :  widening with his bollar being drawn in on Israel's northern border and potentially in a sense
*32:45.380- 32:52.160* :  Iran too and I think that as this operation continues you know nervous eyes will be looking
*32:52.160- 32:59.220* :  to the north all the time to see what might happen there. That was independent defense analyst
*32:59.220- 33:06.160* :  Jonathan Marcus and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global
*33:06.160- 33:11.480* :  news podcast later on. If you want a comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can send
