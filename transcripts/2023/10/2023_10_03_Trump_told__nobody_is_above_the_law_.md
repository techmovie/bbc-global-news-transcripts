*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.540* :  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.780- 00:22.140* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday,
*00:22.140- 00:27.900* :  the 3rd of October. The former US President Donald Trump appears in court in New York,
*00:27.900- 00:33.140* :  accused of making a billion dollars by lying about his assets. The UN approves an
*00:33.140- 00:38.140* :  international security force for Haiti to try to end the gang violence, which has ravaged the
*00:38.140- 00:46.360* :  Caribbean nation. And we didn't imagine that all this would happen. I'm only 34, but this is my
*00:46.360- 00:53.080* :  fourth war. No one has offered us anything. We feel abandoned. The Armenian refugees still in
*00:53.080- 00:57.900* :  shock and desperate for stability after fleeing the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
*01:00.720- 01:06.280* :  Also in the podcast, the World Health Organization recommends a new vaccine against malaria and
*01:06.280- 01:11.800* :  we're still commercially harvesting the fish, but you're also dangling a very big
*01:11.800- 01:18.360* :  parrot in the form of a check. The competition targeting an invasive species off the coast of Florida.
*01:23.060- 01:28.040* :  The former US President Donald Trump has made an angry appearance in court at the start of
*01:28.040- 01:33.480* :  a trial which could land him with a quarter of a billion dollar fine and a ban from doing business
*01:33.480- 01:38.640* :  in New York. He is accused of generating more than a billion dollars by lying about the value
*01:38.640- 01:43.420* :  of his assets. His lawyer told the court there was no illegality and no victims.
*01:43.500- 01:48.100* :  The case, which is being heard without a jury, was brought by the New York Attorney General,
*01:48.100- 01:54.140* :  Latisha James. My message is simple. No matter how powerful you are, no matter how much money you
*01:54.140- 01:59.800* :  think you may have, no one is above the law, and it is my responsibility and my duty and my job
*01:59.800- 02:04.660* :  to enforce it. Even before the case started, the judge has already found Donald Trump and
*02:04.660- 02:10.820* :  too of his sons liable for fraud, including by valuing his New York apartment as if it were three
*02:10.820- 02:17.160* :  times its actual size. The former president has claimed the case is a sham to try to damage his
*02:17.160- 02:22.580* :  chances of re-election. He also lashed out the judge and the New York Attorney General.
*02:23.100- 02:28.020* :  We're wasting our time with this trial. With the Democrat judge from the club houses,
*02:28.020- 02:33.100* :  it's a disgrace. They ought to look for the murderers and the killers that are all over New York
*02:33.500- 02:38.520* :  and the violent crime that's being committed in our city and our state is disgraceful,
*02:38.680- 02:44.140* :  and we're going to be here for months with the judge that already made up his mind as ridiculous.
*02:44.900- 02:50.060* :  Our correspondent in Washington, Gary O'Donohue, has been following what's been said inside
*02:50.060- 02:55.180* :  and outside court. You're seeing a side of Donald Trump that you don't often see,
*02:55.180- 03:00.440* :  and that's him actually being really rattled. Actually, what's the stake here is Donald Trump's
*03:00.580- 03:07.320* :  money, his property, everything which creates and has reinforced his identity over the last 50
*03:07.320- 03:12.260* :  years or so. And I think that is coming through in his reaction here, because bear in mind,
*03:12.260- 03:17.120* :  not only has the judge already ruled that they did fabricate and over-inflate values,
*03:17.120- 03:21.480* :  that's already decided in some ways, the central question. But already some of the business
*03:21.480- 03:28.020* :  licenses have been suspended, some of the properties are being handled by receivers. He has no idea
*03:28.020- 03:31.760* :  at the end of this process whether he's going to own anything in New York anymore.
*03:31.900- 03:36.780* :  He's often appeared bullish outside a court and then a bit quieter and more respectful inside.
*03:36.780- 03:42.000* :  What actually happened during the hearing? The lawyers went at it pretty hard, as we understand it,
*03:42.000- 03:45.500* :  we weren't actually inside the court. Donald Trump sat there through the morning session,
*03:45.500- 03:51.000* :  pretty much ignoring the sort of presentation that the Attorney General's lawyers were giving
*03:51.000- 03:55.640* :  on screen, looking straight ahead. But you could see that's from his reaction afterwards,
*03:55.640- 04:01.360* :  he must have been seething inside. He may not give evidence in this. I think both sides will
*04:01.700- 04:06.500* :  perhaps want him to take the stand, but we will see. And there's a really curious strategy
*04:06.560- 04:12.520* :  ongoing here with him, because his team opted for what's called a bench trial. That's a judge
*04:12.520- 04:17.660* :  rather than a jury, which in some ways makes sense in New York, it's a democratic place. He may
*04:17.660- 04:22.680* :  not get too many friends on a jury there, but then to go and lambast and attack the judge,
*04:22.680- 04:28.240* :  he's called him deranged before. I think he knows by that he's already in trouble in this case,
*04:28.240- 04:34.060* :  in some ways there's nothing to lose, but to try and ring as much political capital out of it,
*04:34.580- 04:38.600* :  by attacking the judge and politicising the process. And of course, off the back of that,
*04:38.600- 04:43.000* :  he has not surprisingly, as he's done with every other legal cases faced sent out
*04:43.280- 04:47.200* :  fundraising emails, because in a lot of cases it's the small dollar donors,
*04:47.200- 04:50.360* :  rather than the super-rich Donald Trump, who's paying his legal bills.
*04:50.800- 04:56.020* :  Our Washington Correspondent Gary O'Donney here. Malaria kills hundreds of thousands of people
*04:56.020- 05:01.580* :  every year, mostly children, below the age of five. Now the head of the World Health Organization,
*05:01.640- 05:06.380* :  Ted Ross, said in Omgibre Yesas, has announced a new front in the battle against the disease.
*05:07.040- 05:13.620* :  Today, it gives me great pleasure to announce that WHO is recommending a second vaccine called
*05:13.620- 05:20.040* :  R-21, Matrix M, to prevent Malaria in children at risk of the disease.
*05:20.880- 05:26.460* :  Well, the vaccine, which is around 75 percent effective, was created by scientists at Oxford
*05:27.260- 05:31.700* :  University. It will be rolled out in Africa from the middle of next year, as our medical editor
*05:31.700- 05:38.940* :  Fergus Walsh. I was in Ghana, I think in 2008, in trials there, and they just weren't getting
*05:38.940- 05:45.840* :  the vaccine to stop the malaria parasite from expanding in the human body. But now they seem
*05:45.840- 05:52.120* :  to have done it. What's different about this vaccine is largely the scale. The Oxford Genoa
*05:52.120- 05:58.260* :  Institute, the same institute that gave us the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, has got a deal with
*05:58.260- 06:04.600* :  the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, the serum institute in India, to produce 100
*06:04.600- 06:09.120* :  million doses a year, because there's no point in having an effective vaccine if it's not used.
*06:09.120- 06:14.840* :  So we're going to see this vaccine rolled out and turbocharging the immunization of young children.
*06:15.160- 06:19.440* :  Two to four dollars is the cost of the vaccine. I think the cost of the vaccine won't be a problem
*06:19.720- 06:25.260* :  more than two dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa want these vaccines. The healthcare workers
*06:25.260- 06:31.580* :  need to administer not one dose, but four doses to protect children under five. And we could see
*06:31.760- 06:37.940* :  within the next 10, 20 years a dramatic reduction in deaths in Africa in young children.
*06:38.300- 06:42.820* :  Fergus Walsh, the trials for the vaccine took place in four African countries,
*06:42.820- 06:49.460* :  Bikina Faso, Marley, Kenya, and Tanzania from where our senior Africa correspondent Ansoy sent
*06:49.460- 06:58.320* :  this report. Tears and more tears, the price this children in Bagamoya Tanzania paid,
*06:58.320- 07:04.600* :  in order to save millions of lives. This is a malaria research centre and they are here for the
*07:04.620- 07:09.660* :  third dose of one of the most promising vaccines yet. You are in Imania, Imania. One of the
*07:09.660- 07:15.460* :  mothers, Mazzani Safe, has brought her sixth born, a preschooler who follows her mom everywhere
*07:15.460- 07:23.600* :  at this centre. I lost my nephew, we buried him. He was only four when he died from malaria.
*07:23.600- 07:29.760* :  That's why when I heard that there was a malaria vaccine trial, I said I wanted to participate.
*07:29.760- 07:37.260* :  It will help many children not just mine. She defied naysayers in her village and enrolled in the study.
*07:37.260- 07:43.120* :  More than 600 children here took part in the research. There is a lot of excitement among researchers,
*07:43.180- 07:49.440* :  says the principal investigator, Dr Ali Olotu. I am proud and I am very hopeful for my community.
*07:49.440- 07:54.620* :  If it is deployed to those who needed the most, then we are talking about saving millions of
*07:54.620- 08:00.260* :  cases of malaria and this is really exciting, with us. Malaria remains one of the biggest
*08:00.260- 08:06.760* :  killer diseases especially in Africa. One more vaccine only means an extra weapon in a fight
*08:06.760- 08:13.240* :  against it. That report from Tanzania by Ansoy. Over the past two years, the Caribbean
*08:13.240- 08:19.040* :  nation of Haiti has been dogged by spiraling violence. The capital, Porto Pras is now largely
*08:19.040- 08:25.640* :  controlled by gangs. A year after the country appealed for help, the UN Security Council has
*08:25.640- 08:31.460* :  finally voted to send an international force to try to restore security. It will be led by Kenya.
*08:31.880- 08:36.880* :  So how is this force likely to be greeted by people in Haiti? Alex Ritson has been speaking
*08:36.880- 08:42.140* :  to the Haitian journalist, Woodlaw Marancore, who is in the capital. The last international
*08:42.180- 08:51.220* :  intervention in Haiti in 2004 was from the UN and this force left Haiti with multiple problems.
*08:51.300- 08:59.260* :  The first one is the cholera epidemic that killed about 10,000 people and close to 800,000 people
*08:59.720- 09:05.080* :  were infected. And this disease we surfaced in Haiti in October last year and is killed
*09:05.080- 09:12.660* :  hundreds of Haitian citizens. The UN left also in Haiti a trail of human rights abuses.
*09:13.540- 09:22.160* :  Many women were sexually abused but they also left hundreds of kids without father in the country
*09:22.780- 09:28.740* :  and without people to take care of them. And right after the UN left Haiti, this force left
*09:28.740- 09:37.920* :  Haiti in 2017 the insecurity resurfaced. The mission that was there to stabilize the Haitian
*09:38.500- 09:44.960* :  did not bring the solution and institutions of the country are not solid enough. They are not
*09:44.960- 09:51.800* :  reinforced. They are not capable of dealing with the issues that Haitians are facing.
*09:52.380- 09:58.300* :  And many people are saying like the solution to the Haitian problem is a Haitian one.
*09:58.840- 10:05.880* :  Gangs reportedly controlled between 30 and 60 percent of Haitians are struggling to do this
*10:05.880- 10:11.380* :  on their own, aren't they? Absolutely and this is the second part of the population and including
*10:11.380- 10:17.820* :  folks in the business sector, we will tell you that about 80 percent of the Haitian capital
*10:17.820- 10:24.220* :  butterflies right now are under the control of gang members. A couple of weeks ago, gangs
*10:24.220- 10:31.040* :  attacked a Khufay and thousands of people had to flee the violence. These gangs they rape,
*10:31.040- 10:38.380* :  they kill babies, they rape young women and they burn people alive inside their own houses.
*10:39.020- 10:45.820* :  So the Haitian national police is outmatched. And it's widely believed a lot of these gangs have
*10:45.820- 10:52.780* :  got links to political parties or to politicians of night. Absolutely that is why many people think
*10:52.780- 10:57.900* :  that the problem of Haiti is a structural problem because these gangs they have access to
*10:57.900- 11:04.520* :  assault rifles and they are extremely rich and a large swath of the political and economic class
*11:04.520- 11:12.540* :  in Haiti is in bed with these gangs. The problem is more of a gang problem than a structural problem
*11:12.540- 11:17.980* :  that needs to be addressed not just in the streets by you know tackling the gangs but also by
*11:17.980- 11:24.440* :  attacking the root causes of gang violence in Haiti. Willow, Marancourt, in Haiti talking to Alex
*11:24.440- 11:32.680* :  Richardson. The Armenian authorities say nearly the entire 120,000 ethnic Armenian population of
*11:32.680- 11:39.280* :  Nagorno-Karabakh has now left the enclave which came under full control of Azerbaijan last week
*11:39.280- 11:45.260* :  after a lightning offensive. Tens of thousands of refugees are in temporary accommodation having fled
*11:45.260- 11:50.340* :  to Armenia. But there are still many in need of a roof over their heads. The BBC's Caucasus
*11:50.340- 11:57.080* :  correspondent Ray Handometri visited a shelter in the town of Goris which has been housing refugees
*11:57.080- 12:07.160* :  from Karabakh. Just two weeks ago these children were hiding in bomb shelters in Nagorno-Karabakh.
*12:07.780- 12:14.380* :  Now they're playing volleyball on their peaceful sky. When on September the 19th Azerbaijan
*12:14.380- 12:20.720* :  launched a military offensive to establish full control of its breakaway territory of Nagorno-Karabakh,
*12:21.280- 12:26.660* :  15-year-old Masis Avanyisan was still at school in his hometown of Martuni.
*12:29.040- 12:35.260* :  At around 2 pm we finished lessons at school. I was on my way home with a friend. We heard
*12:35.260- 12:41.220* :  loud banging at first. I thought it was a military exercise. Then the explosion started to happen
*12:41.220- 12:46.780* :  one after another. We ran to the nearby police station to hide in the basement to save our lives.
*12:49.020- 12:52.720* :  Masis, his parents, siblings and his aunt Lucineh,
*12:53.260- 12:58.720* :  are now huddled into one room inside a temporary shelter set up on the grounds of a local
*12:58.720- 13:04.820* :  non-governmental organization in Goris. Lucineh has four children of her own.
*13:06.460- 13:13.980* :  We didn't imagine that all this would happen. I'm only 34 but this is my fourth war. No one has
*13:13.980- 13:22.440* :  offered us anything. We feel abandoned, she says. Everyone here is traumatized by the violence
*13:22.440- 13:29.200* :  and the sudden uprooting from their homes. They still cannot come to terms with what was left behind
*13:29.260- 13:36.900* :  and the prospects of starting life in June. Annalyxanyan is from the Women in Network Foundation in Goris,
*13:37.400- 13:43.660* :  which set up the shelter at its premises. Here we have a handicraft workshop which we
*13:43.660- 13:50.740* :  temporarily adapt it as a shelter. Two people arriving to Goris and staying here for some time to
*13:50.740- 13:57.420* :  understand where they should go further. Darminian authorities have provided temporary accommodation
*13:57.420- 14:05.380* :  to 35,000 refugees out of the 100,000 that made it here. Many chose to stay with their relatives
*14:05.380- 14:11.580* :  but all of these people will need a long-term solution with housing and jobs as they don't see
*14:11.580- 14:18.300* :  any prospects of returning back to Karabakh. Rehan, Demetri reporting from Goris in southern Armenia.
*14:19.500- 14:24.180* :  Five years ago, Jamal has shocked him, the US-based journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's
*14:24.180- 14:30.860* :  government, walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He never came out. It transpired, he'd
*14:30.860- 14:37.000* :  been murdered by a Saudi hit squad, dismembered, and his remains disposed of never to be found.
*14:37.000- 14:41.660* :  The gruesome killing prompted intense global criticism of the Saudi authorities,
*14:42.360- 14:45.860* :  including the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
*14:46.560- 14:51.820* :  On Monday, Amnesty International said there was still no justice for Mr. Hoshogji's family.
*14:52.520- 14:58.240* :  Jason Rezayan is the global opinions columnist at The Washington Post, where Jamal Hoshogji worked.
*14:58.240- 15:04.880* :  He was also the paper's Tehran correspondent from 2012 to 2016, where he was jailed for espionage
*15:05.140- 15:10.900* :  and held by the Iranian authorities for 544 days. He's been talking to Rob Young.
*15:11.580- 15:17.260* :  I was just getting to know Jamal when he was murdered. He and I wrote for the same global opinion
*15:17.260- 15:22.060* :  section. There was only a couple of us writing for the section at the time, so we had the
*15:22.060- 15:27.060* :  opportunity to meet a few times, and we did an interview together where we talked about the ways
*15:27.060- 15:32.100* :  that we had been treated by these two countries that we really loved. In my case, Iran and his
*15:32.100- 15:36.920* :  Saudi Arabia, I can't say that we were close friends, but I do think that we were on the way.
*15:37.260- 15:42.320* :  Geopolitically, what was the impact it had on relations between the US and Saudi Arabia?
*15:42.700- 15:47.560* :  It was an opportunity to use this as a moment to recalibrate relationship. Trump administration
*15:47.560- 15:53.040* :  chose not to do that. Biden administration, again, had the opportunity to hold Mohammed bin Salman,
*15:53.040- 15:58.940* :  accountable for this vile act, but ultimately, to let him get away with it. For me personally,
*15:58.940- 16:04.800* :  as I watched, I can remember thinking to myself on the day that we heard that Jamal had gone missing
*16:04.800- 16:10.540* :  in a stumble that we were unlikely to ever hear his voice again. If you don't hold accountable
*16:10.980- 16:15.340* :  assassins, and that's really what we're talking about here, it green lights that sort of behavior
*16:15.340- 16:19.960* :  for others. Mohammed bin Salman is a young man. The world could be stuck with him for another
*16:19.960- 16:26.440* :  half century. He has been incredibly brutal with his own populace. We hear a lot about reforms
*16:26.520- 16:30.860* :  going on in the country, but ultimately at what price those people that are pushing for those
*16:30.860- 16:36.360* :  reforms, invariably end up in prison or dead, the truth is adversaries, whether it's Iran,
*16:36.360- 16:42.200* :  Russia, other countries, see that if we let our friends get away with anything, they can get away
*16:42.200- 16:47.680* :  with things as well. Journalists are being arrested in prison in record numbers. They're also
*16:47.680- 16:53.380* :  being kicked out of the countries where they work and landing on Western shores and unable to
*16:53.380- 16:58.440* :  continue their work. So authoritarian states, they're winning. There is not independent media
*16:58.440- 17:04.760* :  operating in these countries. The United States government was the sort of leader of press freedom,
*17:04.940- 17:09.740* :  a letter from a secretary of state, or even a member of Congress to a foreign leader that
*17:09.740- 17:14.580* :  was imprisoning a journalist, usually worked to get that person free. We're no longer the leader
*17:14.580- 17:19.260* :  in the space. The leaders in the space are the authoritarians who are suppressing press freedom,
*17:19.520- 17:24.660* :  and so I think we have to really work together to figure out how we bring this basic value of
*17:24.660- 17:32.200* :  democracy back into play, and I don't see that in the offing anytime soon. Jason Rezion talking to Rob
*17:32.200- 17:41.420* :  Young. Still to come on the global news podcast? Some told me that they didn't dare sit down on
*17:41.420- 17:48.720* :  the subway, others that they think about it every night on the way home. Paranoia and fear as
*17:48.720- 18:00.540* :  France is hit by a bed bug infestation. European Union foreign ministers have met in Ukraine in
*18:00.540- 18:06.580* :  their first ever gathering outside the EU. It was a sign of continued European support for Kiev,
*18:07.140- 18:12.520* :  even as new cracks appear in Western resolve. Over the weekend, US lawmakers left funding for
*18:12.520- 18:18.760* :  Ukraine out of a last-minute budget bill, while in Europe a pro-Russian candidate won the election
*18:18.760- 18:24.680* :  in Slovakia, adding to growing Ukraine's scepticism, seen in places like Hungary and Poland.
*18:24.700- 18:30.660* :  The EU's foreign policy chief, as at Borrel, said Europe was united in its backing for Kiev.
*18:31.120- 18:37.340* :  This joint meeting of the European Union foreign ministers should be understood as a clear
*18:37.340- 18:43.980* :  commitment of the European Union to Ukraine, and it's also sending a strong signal to Russia.
*18:44.320- 18:50.480* :  We are not intimidated by your drones or missiles. Our resolve to support the fight of freedom and
*18:50.480- 18:58.080* :  independence of Ukraine is firm and will continue. The Kremlin said the vote in the US at the weekend
*18:58.080- 19:03.020* :  highlighted growing Ukraine fatigue, though it expected American funding to continue.
*19:03.600- 19:08.100* :  Are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse has more on the EU meeting in-give?
*19:08.540- 19:13.800* :  Above all, this summit was about presenting a united front, and was fueled by the growing political
*19:13.800- 19:18.780* :  scepticism in the US, so whether Ukraine should continue receiving the backing it does.
*19:19.580- 19:25.200* :  $6 billion of new military funding being left out of a short-term budget is a first, concrete
*19:25.200- 19:30.880* :  consequence of that for Kiev. But this gathering saw material outcomes in support of Ukraine,
*19:30.880- 19:36.700* :  including a 12-package of sanctions on Russia and training for 40,000 Ukrainian personnel.
*19:37.140- 19:41.680* :  Recent EU pledges totaling 50 billion euros and not to be sniffed at either.
*19:42.120- 19:44.660* :  Dimitro Koleba is Ukraine's foreign minister.
*19:47.120- 19:51.140* :  Putin's biggest expectation is that the West and the world will get tired of standing with
*19:51.140- 19:56.380* :  Ukraine. We should not play along with that. Anyone who knows what it is like,
*19:56.380- 20:02.320* :  to gather 27 EU foreign ministers in one place, will understand that today's visit is not
*20:02.320- 20:06.700* :  about symbolic support. It's about refuting narratives regarding lack of unity.
*20:07.360- 20:09.720* :  Everyone has shown the political will to be here today.
*20:10.220- 20:14.600* :  It was hoped all 27 EU member foreign ministers would turn up.
*20:14.600- 20:19.600* :  Three didn't, including Poland and Hungary's. The Kremlin says it predicted this fracturing
*20:19.600- 20:25.040* :  in Western support. In the past, President Zelensky's best remedy for political fatigue was
*20:25.040- 20:29.800* :  military progress. With a slower than desired counteroffensive grinding on, he's having to
*20:29.800- 20:34.440* :  rely on his diplomatic skills more than ever since the full-scale invasion of last year.
*20:34.920- 20:36.400* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev
*20:36.800- 20:41.720* :  Indigenous women from Greenland who say they were fitted with contraceptive devices without
*20:41.720- 20:47.700* :  their consent or knowledge, are seeking compensation from the Danish state, the former colonial power.
*20:48.320- 20:53.220* :  The practice was allegedly carried out in the 1960s and is still the subject of an official
*20:54.000- 20:58.640* :  investigation. This report from Danny Eberhardt and a warning it contains some disturbing and
*20:58.640- 21:03.940* :  graphic details. The programme was designed to limit birth rates among Greenland's Indigenous
*21:03.940- 21:10.160* :  Inuit population. At the time, Denmark, the former colonial power, still controlled Greenland's
*21:10.160- 21:15.760* :  health system. Girls as young as 12 were, sometimes without being informed, fitted with
*21:15.760- 21:21.880* :  interuterine devices or coils. The doctors did not seek the consent of the girls or their parents,
*21:21.900- 21:27.080* :  and to make matters worse, many of the devices were too big for the girls' bodies.
*21:27.180- 21:33.260* :  One survivor, Nea Luba, is the spokeswoman for the group of 67 women lodging the claim.
*21:33.260- 21:39.100* :  She told the BBC that when her coil was fitted at the age of 13 or 14, it was torture,
*21:39.700- 21:42.560* :  causing her to blank out the experience due to the trauma.
*21:42.820- 21:52.080* :  It hurts like knife inside me, and when he came up to my uterus, it was also a huge
*21:52.180- 21:58.760* :  torture like pain. It felt like the coil was bigger than my uterus.
*21:59.300- 22:02.140* :  Many girls experienced serious medical complications.
*22:02.740- 22:09.160* :  Some girls couldn't even sit down without pain. They went to the doctor, but they were
*22:09.540- 22:14.440* :  sent back again. They did not allow to have the coil out.
*22:14.920- 22:19.400* :  One girl, Ms. Luba, said, had to receive blood transfusions every three weeks
*22:19.400- 22:25.560* :  before eventually losing her uterus. Many others too were so damaged they were unable to have
*22:25.560- 22:32.200* :  children in later life. It's the same that you sterilize the 12-years-old girl.
*22:32.200- 22:37.860* :  For all the women I know who are 12-years, they can't get pregnant.
*22:38.320- 22:43.060* :  Ms. Luba accused the Danish government of the time of wanting to save money on welfare by
*22:43.060- 22:48.200* :  controlling the size of Greenland's population. An investigation into the scandal is underway.
*22:48.220- 22:54.060* :  It won't report till May 2025. This group of women don't want to wait that long,
*22:54.140- 23:00.060* :  summer in their late 70s. They're demanding $42,000 each in compensation.
*23:00.060- 23:05.940* :  We can never be killed, difficult, but it will help us a compensation,
*23:05.940- 23:13.000* :  and it will be like the government's way to apologize to us so we can move on.
*23:13.540- 23:17.340* :  If the Danish government doesn't pay up, the women say they'll go to court.
*23:18.040- 23:24.720* :  Danielle Bard. A wave of disgust has spread across France as people post images of an apparent
*23:24.720- 23:29.940* :  invasion of bedbugs that are reports of the blood sucking insects being found not just in beds,
*23:29.940- 23:35.220* :  but on trains, the Paris Metro, and even the cinema. Now it seems they've been detected in
*23:35.220- 23:40.480* :  France's second largest city, Marseille. The French government has said it will act to reassure
*23:40.480- 23:46.600* :  and protect the public from the reported surge. Anna Foster asked Clara Edelgo, a journalist from
*23:46.600- 23:54.340* :  La Figurale, what's behind this infestation? Experts have noted an upsurge in cases in recent years,
*23:54.880- 24:01.940* :  and there is a lot of causes like migration. It has nothing to do with hygiene or dirtiness.
*24:02.740- 24:07.240* :  So it's almost that because people are noticing it more and posting to social media,
*24:07.240- 24:12.880* :  that's the crucial thing, isn't it? Of course. From article I interviewed several Parisians,
*24:12.880- 24:20.640* :  and I can say that this situation has created a kind of psychosis, some told me that they didn't
*24:20.640- 24:27.140* :  tear sit down on the subway, others that they think about it every night on the way home, but the hardest
*24:27.140- 24:34.880* :  thing to hear in the testimony of those who are fighting to get rid of these bedbugs. So it's a problem.
*24:35.180- 24:39.580* :  I'm not sure how I would even begin to deal with an infestation of bedbugs. Have the authorities
*24:39.580- 24:45.840* :  got any plans about how they can tackle it? When the videos were released, Paris called on the
*24:45.840- 24:52.100* :  government to take actions against these invasive insects. The minister of transport announced
*24:52.100- 24:58.860* :  last Friday that a meeting will be held with the transport operators, targeted by the accusations,
*24:58.940- 25:05.520* :  they are supposed to meet this week. I think the government is taking this health issue seriously,
*25:05.520- 25:12.520* :  even more so with the Olympics less than a year away. Yes, because of course that's going to
*25:12.520- 25:17.700* :  bring so many tourists to Paris. Well, it's supposed to. Do you think people will be put off by this?
*25:18.340- 25:24.500* :  Paris is not the only tourist city in the world to be affected by these insects. New York, for
*25:24.500- 25:32.740* :  example, had to appoint a bedbugs czar in 2010 to deal with this problem. To return to the Parisian
*25:32.740- 25:39.560* :  case, the presence of bedbugs is not new. They have always been there. So in my opinion, it's not
*25:39.560- 25:44.720* :  something that's going to put tourists off. Journalist Clara Idalgo talking to Anna Foster.
*25:45.600- 25:51.600* :  The authorities in Florida say a record 30,000 lionfish have been removed from the state's waters
*25:51.600- 25:57.460* :  thanks to a competition. Lionfish are native to the Indo-Pacific but have spread to the US East
*25:57.460- 26:03.240* :  coast, the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, where they decimate native fish populations. Hux and
*26:03.240- 26:08.420* :  traps are ineffective against them while trawling with net damages, the coral reefs,
*26:08.920- 26:14.280* :  the only way to get rid of the lionfish is by individual divers going spearfishing as Nikki Cardwell
*26:14.280- 26:21.920* :  reports. With a distinct thought, the divers spears a lionfish and stuffs it into a collection
*26:22.000- 26:28.820* :  tube. Their spectacular looking fish striped with rows of sail-like fins that ripple in the water.
*26:29.280- 26:34.260* :  But these fish of eracious eaters have no predators and lay thousands of eggs every few days.
*26:34.880- 26:37.900* :  Scientists believe there is severe threat to native sea life.
*26:38.540- 26:42.560* :  The Florida authorities believe the problem can only be tackled with the public's help.
*26:43.160- 26:46.100* :  Emily Robeshow is from the Florida Wildlife Commission.
*26:46.420- 26:54.040* :  We have this entire state that is very excited and willing to jump at the opportunity to help us
*26:54.040- 27:00.260* :  in these management efforts. We're going to wake up probably about 3.30 in the morning.
*27:00.260- 27:08.340* :  The first dive is allowed to begin at sunrise and boom and at stick stuff, stick stuff, stick stuff.
*27:08.460- 27:14.040* :  Rachel Bowman won this competition in 2021. She says the opportunity to make a bit of money
*27:14.040- 27:16.360* :  selling her catch was a real incentive.
*27:16.760- 27:20.920* :  For a tournament, we're going to go harder and in a lionfish tournament,
*27:20.920- 27:26.340* :  you are allowed to sell your fish at the end. So we're still commercially harvesting the fish,
*27:26.800- 27:31.220* :  but you're also dangling a very big carrot in the form of a check.
*27:31.220- 27:36.300* :  So the incentive is greater, thus the effort is great.
*27:36.480- 27:42.040* :  Under the rules of the competition, all the lionfish caught must be sold to fish mongers or restaurants.
*27:42.660- 27:45.560* :  Parker Destin owns several seafood restaurants in Florida.
*27:45.800- 27:49.680* :  The fish tastes wonderful. It's a white, mild flaky fish. It's not too oily.
*27:50.200- 27:54.200* :  And you can do anything with it from a culinary preparation style standpoint.
*27:54.200- 27:56.560* :  It's just the best. I mean, it flies off the shelves.
*27:56.920- 28:02.120* :  Marine biologist Alex Fog has been tracking the lionfish invasion since the first ones
*28:02.120- 28:07.800* :  emerged around 15 years ago. He says competitions like this are making a difference.
*28:07.820- 28:12.780* :  What we see is the native species tend to rebound, but it doesn't take long for lionfish
*28:12.780- 28:15.980* :  to start to invade that reef again. So you actually have to keep the pressure on them
*28:15.980- 28:20.340* :  to make sure they can keep that population suppressed to a point that the native species can
*28:20.340- 28:21.940* :  recover to pre-invasion.
*28:23.980- 28:28.100* :  The Florida Wildlife Commission posts instructional videos on its website
*28:28.100- 28:33.720* :  about how to safely remove and prepare lionfish to encourage recreational divers
*28:34.300- 28:36.180* :  to catch them outside of competition.
*28:37.820- 28:44.040* :  Those venomous spines are one of the reasons why the only safe way to catch lionfish is with a spear.
*28:44.560- 28:48.900* :  Animal welfare groups like Peter are opposed to the use of spear fishing.
*28:48.900- 28:54.380* :  They say that as humans were probably responsible for releasing lionfish into Florida waters,
*28:54.380- 28:58.100* :  we have a duty to find a more humane solution to the problem.
*28:58.500- 29:00.800* :  Marine biologist Alex Fog doesn't agree.
*29:01.100- 29:04.560* :  You need to let the entrepreneurs, the divers go out their harvest lionfish,
*29:04.560- 29:08.120* :  and restaurants to recognize that this is a very tasty species that can be
*29:08.280- 29:11.780* :  plated and greater price can be charged for that than native species.
*29:12.020- 29:14.120* :  They're going to keep the lionfish population in check.
*29:14.780- 29:17.340* :  Alex Fog ending that report by Nikki Cardwell.
*29:17.980- 29:21.200* :  The Mahabharata is one of the great epics of Hindu culture,
*29:21.200- 29:24.000* :  dating back more than two and a half thousand years,
*29:24.060- 29:28.980* :  and it's hard as a complex struggle for power between two sides of a warring family.
*29:29.560- 29:32.080* :  The story can take days to perform on stage,
*29:32.080- 29:37.160* :  a new two-part version with an all-Asian cast has just arrived in London from Canada,
*29:37.620- 29:39.300* :  with a running time of just six hours.
*29:39.680- 29:41.640* :  Vincent Dowd went to see it in rehearsal.
*29:42.060- 29:44.100* :  So the furnaces are odd but has been a four.
*29:44.140- 29:44.880* :  We're going from there, okay?
*29:45.740- 29:52.000* :  In a rehearsal room deep under the 1970s concrete of London's Barbican art center,
*29:52.440- 29:56.880* :  actors and musicians are recreating the magic of the ancient Mahabharata.
*29:57.880- 30:03.500* :  This two-part version in English with some Sanskrit was seen earlier this year
*30:03.500- 30:06.900* :  in Canada at the Shaw Festival Theatre in Ontario.
*30:07.320- 30:08.240* :  My name is Ravi Jane.
*30:08.300- 30:10.820* :  I'm the director and co-writer of Mahabharata.
*30:11.060- 30:12.180* :  My name is Miriam Fernandez.
*30:12.180- 30:15.600* :  I am the co-writer and I play the storyteller in Mahabharata.
*30:15.800- 30:17.780* :  Mahabharata is an ancient Indian story,
*30:18.040- 30:21.120* :  and within it is moral lessons about how to live in the world,
*30:21.120- 30:25.880* :  and it contains all the spirituality and philosophies of Hindu culture and religion.
*30:25.980- 30:28.560* :  The original composer of the story was Viasa,
*30:28.760- 30:31.080* :  and he told it to the elephant-headed god Ganesha,
*30:31.160- 30:33.220* :  and Ganesha was the first one to scribe the story.
*30:37.980- 30:39.880* :  For some, it is absolutely history,
*30:39.880- 30:44.940* :  and for others, it is myth and a world of gods and humans that interact.
*30:44.940- 30:46.640* :  It's pretty fantastical and amazing,
*30:46.640- 30:49.420* :  but the characters are in the everyday lives of everyone.
*30:49.600- 30:52.400* :  You know, you'll be in a crowded, busy streetway in India,
*30:52.800- 30:54.760* :  and on the corner is a temple to Ganesha.
*30:58.300- 31:00.920* :  There are countless versions of the Mahabharata,
*31:01.400- 31:04.720* :  so how has Ravi Jane ensured this version works,
*31:04.720- 31:07.060* :  both the people who know the story well,
*31:07.440- 31:10.000* :  or who know almost nothing about it?
*31:10.200- 31:12.640* :  If you know it really well, you see the shortcuts we're taking,
*31:12.640- 31:15.040* :  you see the playfulness of how we're depicting characters,
*31:15.480- 31:17.620* :  you recognize them, and you have one experience,
*31:17.660- 31:20.000* :  and for those who it's totally new,
*31:20.460- 31:22.960* :  you get to introduce these people for the first time,
*31:23.380- 31:28.100* :  and we've taken a lot of care to manage the expectations of those different audiences.
*31:29.120- 31:32.180* :  Among those rehearsing Jay Emanuel, born in India,
*31:32.420- 31:34.060* :  but raised in Australia.
*31:34.560- 31:37.020* :  I really believe that this production is a good melt
*31:37.020- 31:40.480* :  of the Eastern and the Western movement languages, especially.
*31:41.100- 31:44.540* :  My training, for example, is in physical theatre training from Paris,
*31:44.920- 31:48.340* :  but I've also trained in Kathakalif from Kalamandlam in Kerala,
*31:48.460- 31:51.420* :  so quite a lot of different trainings and experiences.
*31:54.120- 31:56.660* :  Yeah, the cast is completely from the South Asian diaspora,
*31:56.660- 31:59.300* :  but an international cast, so folks who grew up in Malaysia,
*32:00.060- 32:02.540* :  Australia, in India, in Canada, in the States,
*32:02.540- 32:06.360* :  all over the UK, so everybody has roots in the South Asian diaspora,
*32:06.360- 32:09.120* :  but have experienced kind of an intersection of cultures,
*32:09.120- 32:11.940* :  where East and West all together on stage.
*32:11.980- 32:16.980* :  The chance to watch the Mahabharata outside South Asia is rare.
*32:17.520- 32:20.600* :  This version's at the Barbican Centre in London for a week,
*32:21.200- 32:25.420* :  and it's hoped other international touring dates will be announced next year.
*32:31.900- 32:33.660* :  The Report by Vincent Dowd
*32:36.380- 32:40.920* :  I'm out all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*32:40.920- 32:43.860* :  This edition was mixed by Johnny Hall and produced by Emma Joseph.
*32:44.320- 32:46.440* :  Our editors, Karen Martin, I'm Oliver Conway.
*32:46.440- 32:47.800* :  Until next time, goodbye.
