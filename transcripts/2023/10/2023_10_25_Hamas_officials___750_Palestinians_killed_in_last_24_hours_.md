*00:41.960- 00:48.800* :  I'm Charlotte Gallagher and 13 hours GMT on Wednesday 25 October, these are our main stories.
*00:48.800- 00:55.960* :  The main UN agency in the Gaza Strip has said it's sheltering nearly 600,000 people in its
*00:55.960- 01:01.980* :  facilities. It's warned that fuel supplies are running out and it won't be able to provide support
*01:01.980- 01:08.760* :  after tonight. Israel says it will deny UN officials visas in response to remarks from the UN
*01:08.760- 01:17.260* :  Secretary General. Also in this podcast, a powerful hurricane described as potentially catastrophic
*01:17.420- 01:30.500* :  has made landfall on Mexico's Pacific coast and the US actor Richard Roundtree, who's leading role
*01:30.500- 01:35.900* :  in the Shaft film franchise is considered to be a turning point for African American actors
*01:36.380- 01:38.220* :  has died at his home in Los Angeles.
*01:42.540- 01:51.200* :  We start the podcast in Gaza, where Hamas say more than 750 Palestinians, including 344 children
*01:51.200- 01:57.200* :  have been killed in Israeli air strikes over the past 24 hours. The casualty figures have been
*01:57.200- 02:04.160* :  rising sharply in the past few days. International calls are growing for humanitarian pause in Gaza
*02:04.640- 02:09.520* :  after UN aid workers said they wouldn't be able to provide support past Wednesday without
*02:09.520- 02:15.740* :  fuel deliveries. The UN agency Palestinian refugees has warned its shelters in the Gaza Strip
*02:15.740- 02:22.400* :  are overwhelmed with displaced people seeking refuge. It said the facilities were holding 600,000
*02:22.400- 02:27.900* :  Palestinians four times their capacity, but many were still having to sleep in the streets.
*02:27.980- 02:33.740* :  Israel for its part says fuel deliveries could fall into the hands of Hamas, which many
*02:33.740- 02:38.360* :  western governments classify as a terrorist organization. Our correspondent,
*02:38.360- 02:43.640* :  Rushdie Abu Alouf, sent this report from Khan Unis in the south of the Gaza Strip.
*03:03.500- 03:09.620* :  Everything will be shut. Imagine this hospital. Now it's the main medical center for almost
*03:10.080- 03:17.360* :  half of Gaza population and it will be stopped soon. They are still struggling to find some sort of
*03:17.360- 03:22.980* :  fuel they buy it from local companies they buy it. If it's available in some withdrawal station
*03:23.540- 03:29.460* :  to keep only the emergency room of that hospital working and going. Most of the other
*03:29.820- 03:34.840* :  department in the hospital were shut because they want to minimize the amount of fuel that they
*03:34.840- 03:42.140* :  spend. You know they are buying time they just focus on the saving life mission so people who are
*03:42.140- 03:47.980* :  just having like kidney dialysis they want to be able to do it so very catastrophic situation
*03:47.980- 03:54.740* :  in this hospital and in other hospitals. Nick Robinson spoke to one former resident of Gaza City
*03:54.740- 04:01.740* :  Najla Shahwa who works for Oxfam and relocated to the south of the Gaza Strip. She and her two
*04:01.740- 04:09.040* :  daughters now live in a house which is home to 57 people. So what is life like and has relocating
*04:09.040- 04:16.780* :  made her feel safer? Not at all I wish. You know the past nights have been really difficult.
*04:17.060- 04:21.620* :  There has been continuous thanks shelling. Now as I'm speaking there is distant bombing.
*04:22.380- 04:28.380* :  During the day there are air strikes. At night we manage to sleep but we sleep and wake up to sleep
*04:28.380- 04:35.400* :  and wake up and like every maybe 20 minutes or so. Sometimes it becomes closer so we go all
*04:35.400- 04:40.940* :  hide in the room because I sleep in the car outside. The inside is limited at the end of the day
*04:40.940- 04:47.540* :  with 57 and the priority is for the elderly and the little kids. We just keep on moving and
*04:47.540- 04:53.240* :  shuffling. Sometimes we take shifts. You take shifts to sleep because there is room? Absolutely
*04:53.240- 04:58.600* :  yes. In the beginning we had no mattresses but now we have some but we have no room to put them
*04:58.660- 05:04.260* :  but we are unfortunately getting used to very little sleep because it's very terrifying at night.
*05:04.260- 05:09.820* :  It's horrible but you can also realize that okay it's not on top of me yet. That's exactly what I
*05:09.820- 05:15.900* :  keep on telling myself. What do you tell your children you've got two daughters, nine and six?
*05:16.800- 05:22.320* :  What do you say to them? Do they know what's happening? Unfortunately they know more than they
*05:22.320- 05:30.160* :  should at such age. Sometimes they just start crying. Are we going to go back? The older one
*05:30.160- 05:35.760* :  realizes that it's long-term and she just goes into like difficult, difficult to mold where she
*05:35.760- 05:41.960* :  just can't express it anymore or she just starts crying. They are distracted by them. Many
*05:41.960- 05:47.240* :  people that are here. I can hear happy sounds of children in the background there. They manage
*05:47.240- 05:55.800* :  to play. Do they manage to have some time away from the horror of it? They do. It's very strange
*05:55.800- 06:03.620* :  but they do. Children manage to do things really an amazing way. They play, they sing together. We
*06:03.620- 06:10.000* :  have some notebooks and papers. They manage to draw stuff. They even organize themselves and do
*06:10.000- 06:16.100* :  some classroom kind of activity and when it really hits hard they just kind of come closer
*06:16.140- 06:22.620* :  and they look at the sky. They watch where the smoke is. And what about food? So food it differs
*06:22.620- 06:27.240* :  from place to another because some shops were actually physically damaged but there is still
*06:27.240- 06:33.360* :  basic supplies running. The problem is cooking gas. It's very limited. We had two days of like
*06:33.360- 06:42.440* :  very limited or no bread. We did some baking but we had not enough wood to have fire. We found a
*06:42.440- 06:48.960* :  nice lady who agreed to take some flour and bake for us the big batch and we celebrated the bread
*06:48.960- 06:56.120* :  yesterday. It was like a feast so everyone had nice sandwiches. How much power have you got
*06:56.120- 07:02.400* :  at the moment? Zero from the grid. Since, I don't know, 14, 15. How many days have we been?
*07:02.800- 07:08.200* :  Yeah, since the beginning of it. So we are totally dependent on our solar panel. We have one
*07:08.200- 07:14.020* :  refrigerator on to keep it during the day but the batteries are also not in the best shape.
*07:14.880- 07:21.700* :  Natural shower in Gaza. The suffering of civilians in Gaza is increasing calls for at least a
*07:21.700- 07:27.680* :  lull in the Israeli military operation to allow more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Our
*07:27.680- 07:33.460* :  correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda, told me that pressure on Israel to allow in fuel isn't letting
*07:33.460- 07:37.980* :  up. It's not and there have been these warnings now for days that the fuel is being cut off,
*07:37.980- 07:43.000* :  that it was needed for hospitals in order to run their generators but also for other essential
*07:43.000- 07:48.280* :  equipment for water desalination plants, water filtration and pumps and sewage water treatment
*07:48.300- 07:53.000* :  and it's just got more and more desperate of course the humanitarian situation in Gaza. We've
*07:53.040- 07:57.820* :  still not seen any fuel going in and even after Unruha, which is the biggest Palestinian
*07:57.820- 08:03.680* :  agency operating in the Gaza Strip, put out this message saying it was going to have to stop
*08:04.180- 08:10.220* :  its humanitarian operation because it's reserves of fuel running down to like the last drops.
*08:10.220- 08:16.260* :  Then the Israeli military actually reposted that on its social media feeds and said,
*08:16.760- 08:21.500* :  you know, ask a mass if you can have some of its fuel that published a satellite image of storage
*08:21.500- 08:27.420* :  tanks which it said contained 500,000 liters of fuel belonging to Hamas. There's also a lot of
*08:27.420- 08:33.880* :  talk from the US and other countries about perhaps a low or pause in the fighting to help civilians
*08:33.880- 08:39.460* :  in Gaza. I mean how likely is that? I mean international pressure is definitely building for
*08:39.460- 08:45.300* :  something like that because while Israel has been able to dismiss and has had US packing for
*08:45.300- 08:50.120* :  dismissing some of the international calls there have been for a complete ceasefire they've come
*08:50.120- 08:55.660* :  from the UN Secretary General they've come from Russia and from Arab countries. Now we have had
*08:55.660- 09:01.420* :  the US commenting that perhaps you know as Israel must take all possible precautions to avoid harm
*09:01.420- 09:07.920* :  to civilians in accordance with international law that could mean that humanitarian pauses should
*09:07.920- 09:12.600* :  be considered to let in essential humanitarian assistance and get it to those who need it. It's a
*09:12.600- 09:17.260* :  new message that's coming from the US which of course is Israel's closest ally and we've also seen
*09:17.260- 09:22.800* :  a row break out between Israel and the UN Secretary General. That's right and it's a row that's
*09:22.800- 09:28.240* :  really been escalating through the day so at the UN just to remind people the Secretary General Antonio
*09:28.240- 09:32.800* :  Guterres he first of all talked about how there are violations of international law by both sides
*09:33.360- 09:40.260* :  when it came to Hamas using civilians as human shields he said when it came to Israel's bombardment
*09:40.260- 09:45.900* :  he said that there was the fundamental principle of respecting and protecting civilians but then he
*09:45.900- 09:50.780* :  went on to say it's important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum
*09:50.780- 09:56.840* :  and he described how the Palestinian people he said have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating
*09:56.840- 10:03.820* :  occupation gave more details of the historical conflict over decades. Israel reacted extremely
*10:03.820- 10:08.100* :  angrily to this it called on Antonio Guterres to resign immediately saying he'd lost
*10:08.100- 10:12.820* :  all morality and impartiality and now there are calls for visas to be cancelled for UN officials
*10:12.820- 10:18.720* :  wanting to come to Israel. Yola now in Jerusalem and we heard there that Israel has pushed back
*10:18.720- 10:23.920* :  strongly against those comments Mark Greggeth is a senior adviser to Israel's prime minister.
*10:24.420- 10:30.980* :  Speaking to the BBC he accused the UN chief of bias. The United Nations has to show itself to be
*10:30.980- 10:35.620* :  a a reasonable partner here and we've been the past worked with Secretary Generals and worked
*10:35.620- 10:41.460* :  with the UN effectively on numerous issues but I'd remind you that two of the current Secretary Generals
*10:41.460- 10:47.460* :  predecessors both Kofia Nun and Banki Moon publicly address the issue of institutional
*10:47.460- 10:53.460* :  structural anti-Israel bias in the UN. This Secretary General has not done so he seems to have adopted
*10:53.460- 11:01.460* :  and embraced that structural and organizational bias against my country. Dennis Ross was a US envoy
*11:01.460- 11:07.500* :  to the Middle East for 12 years. He spoke to my colleague Justin Webb about the UN Secretary General's
*11:07.500- 11:13.840* :  comments and warning the content is distressing from the start. It really is problematic at one level.
*11:13.840- 11:20.720* :  I mean it sounds like you're trying to say that this didn't occur out of nowhere but the fact is
*11:21.560- 11:30.140* :  you go and you cut the you know a baby out of a pregnant woman you kill the kids in front of the
*11:30.140- 11:37.240* :  parents and vice versa. You you burn a mother and a child together. There is nothing that
*11:37.240- 11:43.200* :  justifies that and there shouldn't be any effort to try to qualify it or say well you know let's
*11:43.200- 11:49.060* :  understand that this didn't just appear out of the ether it's not desperation that produces that.
*11:49.060- 11:54.720* :  That's just behavior that is completely unacceptable and should be seen as completely illegitimate
*11:55.600- 12:00.080* :  and I think that's he should have there should have been a straight condemnation without trying
*12:00.080- 12:05.540* :  to qualify it in any way. And what many Israelis will say is that this is part of a pattern of the way
*12:05.540- 12:10.520* :  they are treated the way they're approached by the UN as an organization. Well I think there is a
*12:10.900- 12:15.260* :  a sense on the Israeli side that there is a legacy here and they see that frequently so it does
*12:15.960- 12:21.140* :  it does raise questions in their mind about when the UN approaches them and obviously they
*12:21.140- 12:25.400* :  look at you look at things like the UN Human Rights Council where you have some of the worst human
*12:25.400- 12:32.800* :  rights abusers on the council itself and most of resolutions are related to Israel so it does
*12:32.800- 12:37.680* :  create from their standpoint a sense that when it comes to the UN they will never get a fair shake.
*12:38.040- 12:44.900* :  In the meantime these hostages are still in desperate circumstances and the world looks on
*12:45.460- 12:55.360* :  what do you think behind the scenes can be achieved before a military action by Israel that might
*12:55.360- 13:04.340* :  result in the hostages dying. The key is Qatar able to have meaningful influence with Hamas.
*13:05.000- 13:12.280* :  I mean after all you have political leaders of Hamas that are allowed to stay in Qatar
*13:13.720- 13:19.120* :  allowed to have a platform in Qatar and I think the administration has basically been saying to them
*13:19.360- 13:23.660* :  you're trying to convince us that it's good for you to have a relationship with Hamas.
*13:24.480- 13:29.000* :  We need to see some indication that it actually produces something. We have seen four hostages
*13:29.000- 13:35.920* :  released out of 222 so I think if you're going to see any real delay with Israelis
*13:37.980- 13:43.480* :  further delay on the issue of them coming in on the ground you're going to have to see a much
*13:43.480- 13:48.800* :  larger release of hostages than we've seen so far. That was Dennis Ross speaking to my colleague
*13:48.800- 13:54.920* :  Justin Webb. Away from the conflict in the Middle East now and in a historic ruling Japan's
*13:54.920- 14:01.060* :  Supreme Court has declared that a law requiring the removal of reproductive organs in order to change
*14:01.060- 14:07.220* :  gender legally is unconstitutional. The court's decision was prompted by a transgender woman who
*14:07.220- 14:13.700* :  was born a man and didn't want to undergo sterilization. Japan is one of 18 countries that requires
*14:13.700- 14:19.340* :  such surgery a position opposed by the World Health Organization. Our correspondent in Tokyo,
*14:19.340- 14:24.700* :  Shima Halil told me what impact this change will have. It's quite a significant ruling by the
*14:24.700- 14:29.220* :  Supreme Court really because for the first time since this law has been put in place about 20
*14:29.220- 14:35.240* :  years ago, Japan's top court has decided that the sterilization surgery requirement is unconstitutional
*14:35.240- 14:42.580* :  for someone under Japan's gender identity disorder law. A person can legally change their gender
*14:42.580- 14:49.560* :  if a number of conditions are met including the most stark one is undergoing surgery to remove
*14:49.560- 14:55.420* :  their reproductive organs. What today's ruling means is that they don't have to go the sterilization
*14:55.500- 15:01.280* :  surgery and today the country's Supreme Court ruled in favor of a transgender woman who challenged
*15:01.280- 15:06.700* :  the law with her lawyer arguing that her reproductive ability has already been diminished significantly
*15:06.700- 15:11.880* :  by years of hormone therapy but also adding that forcing someone to go into surgery
*15:11.880- 15:18.200* :  could entail physical suffering and the risk of after-effects. So it means a significant change
*15:18.200- 15:22.980* :  for a number of people who want to legally change their gender but don't necessarily want to go
*15:22.980- 15:28.420* :  through that surgery. And Japan is a socially conservative country. So what kind of challenges
*15:28.420- 15:33.500* :  do people face who want to change their gender? It really is a big challenge. Look LGBTQ
*15:34.420- 15:38.140* :  support groups have long said that this law has failed to match the reality of the transgender
*15:38.140- 15:43.920* :  community and what's interesting is that you see this growing support for LGBT issues and yet
*15:44.540- 15:50.140* :  you face opposition from the country's conservative circles be that conservative politicians or
*15:50.140- 15:55.880* :  conservative groups. So for example for the last few weeks you've had opposing groups including
*15:55.880- 16:01.580* :  saved women's space who've collected thousands and thousands of signatures asking the Supreme Court
*16:01.580- 16:06.560* :  to deem that law constitutional which of course now it hasn't but their argument is that if
*16:06.560- 16:12.140* :  transgender people don't undergo surgery women won't feel safe and it will be legally confusing.
*16:12.140- 16:18.440* :  So it is still quite controversial. Remember this is the only G7 country that hasn't legalized
*16:18.440- 16:23.720* :  same sex marriage so it's still quite an issue even of this ruling today is seen as a big
*16:23.720- 16:30.960* :  legal win for the transgender community here. Shima Halil in Tokyo. A powerful storm has hit
*16:30.960- 16:37.340* :  southern Mexico. Hurricane Otis developed rapidly becoming a category five hurricane as it made
*16:37.340- 16:43.760* :  landfall near the resort city of Acapulco. As we record this podcast it has lowered in intensity
*16:43.760- 16:50.240* :  to a category four as it spreads inland but the US National Hurricane Agency is still describing
*16:50.240- 16:55.720* :  it as life threatening. Vanessa Bush-Luter, our online Latin America and Caribbean editor,
*16:55.720- 17:02.440* :  has been following developments. We're getting in reports from people in Acapulco who are saying that
*17:02.440- 17:08.120* :  it feels like a tremor it feels like an earthquake rather than a storm and there's footage
*17:08.980- 17:15.660* :  making the rounds on social media of people in a hospital where the windows have been blown in by
*17:15.660- 17:22.300* :  the force of the winds and they're holding the beds down. They're holding on to the railings and
*17:22.300- 17:30.240* :  just to resist the force of that wind. A lot of the damage was caused overnight. This was a storm
*17:30.240- 17:37.720* :  that developed so rapidly that the normal warning systems that are in place were alerted.
*17:38.080- 17:43.340* :  So a lot of people will have been caught by this by surprise. And what about now are people
*17:43.340- 17:47.860* :  managing to get into shelters or is there still fears that some people are really exposed?
*17:48.460- 17:53.540* :  Yes, people are making their ways into shelters where they can but of course sometimes it is
*17:53.540- 17:58.900* :  more dangerous to then leave the place that you are and go somewhere when the winds are already
*17:59.460- 18:06.240* :  at this strength. Normally what would happen is that a storm like this would develop over water
*18:06.240- 18:12.420* :  and you'd have hours, days sometimes of the storm strengthening slowly and people could
*18:12.540- 18:18.240* :  board up their windows and seek shelter but that didn't happen this time and that's why it's so
*18:18.240- 18:25.360* :  dangerous. That was Vanessa Bushluter. The Australian City of Sydney is reviewing plaques on statues
*18:25.360- 18:30.120* :  linked to the country's colonial past. After concerns are raised they could be ignoring
*18:30.120- 18:37.180* :  historical atrocities from Sydney Phil Mercer reports. Sydney has 25 government funded statues
*18:37.180- 18:43.580* :  of Australia's early colonial leaders. If on Weldon the city's first Aboriginal counsellor
*18:43.580- 18:50.020* :  believes many of their inscriptions are inaccurate misleading and offensive. A statue of the
*18:50.020- 18:57.380* :  British explorer Captain James Cook declares that he discovered Australia in 1770. However,
*18:57.380- 19:04.760* :  indigenous history dates back up to 65,000 years. The review won't look at replacing the monuments
*19:04.780- 19:09.620* :  only whether their plaques should be amended to reflect Australia's complicated
*19:10.340- 19:14.920* :  and at times brutal colonisation. That was Phil Mercer in Sydney.
*19:17.520- 19:23.200* :  Coming up new research suggests ultra-processed foods can trigger addictive behaviors
*19:23.200- 19:30.860* :  comparable to consuming alcohol or tobacco. When we look at the amount of early death and disease
*19:30.860- 19:36.900* :  associated with excessive intake of these ultra-processed foods it's really on par with our most deadly
*19:36.900- 19:48.220* :  addictive drugs which are cigarettes. The explanation is the podcast from the BBC World Service
*19:48.220- 19:54.760* :  that goes beyond the spin exploring the important questions about long-running stories
*19:55.360- 20:01.220* :  and the latest global news. An honest explanation of the events shaping our lives.
*20:02.060- 20:06.700* :  Search for the explanation wherever you get your BBC podcast.
*20:11.460- 20:16.500* :  Let's turn to the US now where the government has been paralysed since the speaker of the House
*20:16.500- 20:22.860* :  of Representatives was ousted earlier this month. Three Republicans have now tried and failed to get
*20:22.860- 20:29.300* :  the top job with the party struggling to unite behind one person. The latest candidate Tom Emmer
*20:29.300- 20:34.340* :  dropped out of the race just hours after being nominated as our correspondent Anthony Zurchert
*20:34.340- 20:41.480* :  told Alex Ritson. You can measure the lives of Republican speaker designates in hours, not days now.
*20:41.480- 20:47.480* :  Tom Emmer is a Minnesota Republican. He's the third ranking Republican in the House of Representatives
*20:47.480- 20:53.380* :  and he stepped forward to run for speaker against seven other candidates today. He ended up
*20:53.600- 21:00.400* :  winning the vote being the pick of a majority of Republicans with 117 votes and no sooner had he
*21:00.400- 21:06.280* :  won. Donald Trump came out and said that it would be a tragic mistake if Republicans backed him for
*21:06.280- 21:13.120* :  speaker. Said that he was a globalist and didn't really support him and a handful of Republicans
*21:13.120- 21:19.100* :  came out of the House of Representatives and said that they were going to block his nomination,
*21:19.100- 21:26.120* :  his candidacy, and he pulled out. So it was a very quick process but Tom Emmer
*21:26.420- 21:30.260* :  speaker designate for an hour and then now they're back to the drawing board trying to find
*21:30.260- 21:35.700* :  who might be able to cobble together that 217 votes in the House of Representatives
*21:35.700- 21:40.120* :  to be elected speaker. So it was Donald Trump's description of him as a
*21:40.520- 21:47.700* :  a rhino or a Republican in name only that did for him. It certainly opened the doors to
*21:47.740- 21:54.080* :  a sizable number of Republicans in the House to object to him. Now that there is no guarantee
*21:54.080- 21:58.380* :  that even if Donald Trump had kept his mouth closed that Emmer would have been able to win
*21:59.020- 22:05.860* :  but it accelerated it considerably. So what next? When will there be a speaker? What
*22:05.860- 22:11.180* :  root is there to a speaker on what's America making of this? Well it's been three weeks now
*22:11.180- 22:17.280* :  and what next is that Republicans are going back to the drawing board. You know I think the
*22:17.380- 22:21.980* :  American public this isn't directly affecting their lives right now. This is a political drama.
*22:21.980- 22:27.600* :  This is certainly a Washington drama. It's an embarrassment for Republicans but it's not having
*22:27.600- 22:33.820* :  any kind of real world impact on American voters yet. When it might start to have that happen
*22:33.820- 22:39.860* :  is if they can't get a speaker seated before the middle of November and the government shuts down
*22:40.380- 22:46.160* :  and Americans will be inconvenienced. Some Americans will feel very distinct pain from not having
*22:46.160- 22:51.080* :  government services and then I think they'll start looking for whom to blame and the Republicans
*22:51.080- 22:55.680* :  being the the obvious target. But the clock is ticking towards there and the longer the
*22:55.680- 23:01.760* :  straggs out the more chance that that government shutdown will happen. Anthony Zurcher staying in
*23:01.760- 23:09.020* :  the United States and an off duty pilot who's accused of trying to crash a plane has pleaded not guilty
*23:09.020- 23:15.940* :  to 83 charges of attempted murder. Joseph Emerson was sitting in the cockpit of an Alaska Airlines
*23:15.940- 23:21.960* :  flight on Sunday when he allegedly tried to overpower the captain and disable the engine. Our
*23:21.960- 23:28.000* :  correspondent Peter Boes is following the case. Joseph Emerson is facing a whole raft of charges.
*23:28.000- 23:35.080* :  It is an extraordinary story. 83 counts of attempted murder, one for each person on board, 83 counts
*23:35.100- 23:42.060* :  of reckless endangement, one count of endangering and aircraft. And through his lawyer, he's pleaded
*23:42.060- 23:47.880* :  not guilty. At an initial court appearance in Portland, there will no doubt be many more to come
*23:48.300- 23:54.900* :  including an appearance in federal court to face charges of interfering with flight crew members
*23:55.420- 24:00.540* :  and attendants. Now, just to recap what happened, there's been a long sequence of events here. He
*24:00.540- 24:06.620* :  was traveling in the jump seat in the cockpit of this plane. That's the seat just behind the flights
*24:06.620- 24:12.040* :  captain and first officer. And it seems this is a situation that is allowed that pilots from
*24:12.360- 24:19.240* :  other airlines, in this case a partner airline, are allowed to use these seats. Very few other
*24:19.600- 24:26.060* :  crew members are authorized to do so. So it was from within the cockpit that he allegedly made an
*24:26.060- 24:31.200* :  attempt to cut off the engines. He was unsuccessful. There was a brief struggle. He was eventually
*24:31.200- 24:36.260* :  handcuffed to a seat at the back of the plane. And it was later when he was interviewed by the police
*24:36.260- 24:42.540* :  that he said he'd taken psychedelic mushrooms, seemingly for the first time, and that he thought he
*24:42.540- 24:49.740* :  was having a nervous breakdown. And he also said that he hadn't slept for 40 hours. It is just
*24:49.760- 24:56.160* :  extraordinary. His idea that he had taken psychedelic mushrooms before being allowed in the cockpit
*24:56.160- 25:01.420* :  of a plane. How can this have happened? Well, that is a huge question. And I think it is that issue
*25:01.420- 25:07.460* :  that is concerning so many people. Now, it is a fact that pilots during the course of their
*25:07.840- 25:15.320* :  careers are required to undergo regular medical examinations to report all the medications they're
*25:15.320- 25:21.260* :  taking to answer questions about their mental health. They're seen by aviation medical
*25:21.260- 25:26.980* :  examiners. And these people are trained to spot potential problems and their protocols to evaluate
*25:26.980- 25:32.940* :  whether a condition requires treatment, whether they preclude someone from doing their job.
*25:32.960- 25:36.840* :  And this is a process that I'll say goes on throughout the career of a pilot. So clearly,
*25:36.840- 25:43.660* :  questions are being asked about the very specific details in this case. How apparently no warning
*25:43.660- 25:49.720* :  signs of a potential problem were spotted, which is a particular concern of the traveling public
*25:50.160- 25:57.000* :  in this country, especially at a time when USA Aviation is facing so many questions related
*25:57.000- 26:03.120* :  to safety, including a different topic. But there are many concerns here about neomisses.
*26:03.760- 26:10.740* :  Peter Bays. New research suggests ultra-processed foods like cakes, crisps and processed meats
*26:10.740- 26:17.940* :  can trigger addictive behaviors comparable to consuming alcohol or tobacco. Extra sugar, fat
*26:17.940- 26:23.620* :  and salt is often added to the refined products. The study is by a group of researchers from Michigan
*26:24.340- 26:31.420* :  University who analyze more than 280 studies from 36 countries. Professor Ashley Gehrhardt is the
*26:31.420- 26:37.920* :  lead researcher of the study. The most deadly addictive drug out there is tobacco. It kills more
*26:37.920- 26:43.860* :  people every year than alcohol and cocaine and heroin combined. So when we look at the amount
*26:43.940- 26:50.140* :  of early death and disease associated with excessive intake of these ultra-processed foods,
*26:50.140- 26:55.960* :  it's really on par with our most deadly addictive drugs, which are cigarettes. Countries like
*26:55.960- 27:01.640* :  the United Kingdom, the United States that have environments that are particularly highly
*27:01.640- 27:08.380* :  dominated by ultra-processed foods where that's maybe half of your food supply are those where we're
*27:08.380- 27:14.400* :  seeing kind of higher levels of this addictive pattern of intake. Some of the more mediterranean
*27:14.400- 27:20.260* :  countries, countries like Italy, where they have less ultra-processed foods and their food supply,
*27:20.260- 27:25.040* :  we think that the levels of endorsement are often lower. And one of the spots that I am really
*27:25.040- 27:30.560* :  concerned is actually developing countries that are going through this really rapid nutrition
*27:30.560- 27:36.180* :  transition right now. And as we're seeing those ultra-processed foods start to dominate,
*27:36.180- 27:41.400* :  we're seeing that the loss of control, the diet, related disease, the inability to cut down
*27:41.400- 27:45.720* :  is coming along with it. So it's going to be a growing problem in many developing countries,
*27:45.720- 27:52.100* :  unless we step in and do something. That was Ashley Gehrhardt. Since the October 7th attacks by
*27:52.100- 27:57.760* :  Hamas out of Gaza, the other Palestinian territory, the West Bank, has been mostly out of the
*27:57.760- 28:03.880* :  headlines, but it's been even more tense than usual. Four more Palestinians were killed in Israeli
*28:03.880- 28:09.160* :  raids overnight, bringing the total number of West Bank Palestinians killed since the 7th
*28:09.160- 28:15.340* :  October to around 100. The West Bank is roughly between Jerusalem and the River Jordan,
*28:15.340- 28:21.520* :  and Israel has settled hundreds of thousands of Jews there, illegally under international law,
*28:21.520- 28:26.500* :  though it disputes this. Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen, has been touring the area.
*28:27.020- 28:32.540* :  His report starts in a remote and hard-line settlement of highly religious Jewish nationalists.
*28:33.620- 28:38.860* :  Hello. How are you, Jeremy? Nice to meet you. How are you doing?
*28:40.340- 28:46.960* :  Does anybody live here permanently? There's a few families living here in these
*28:46.960- 28:52.080* :  caravans, and that's in this one bachelor who lives in this specific place where we are now.
*28:52.300- 28:55.240* :  And what about the neighbors? What about the Palestinians here?
*28:55.680- 29:04.640* :  I'll show you. Okay. So he's just, we're walking across the hilltop. It's got bits of broken
*29:04.640- 29:13.220* :  metal and smashed up cars. He's got a, what looks like a 18-inch machete and a leather
*29:13.220- 29:22.180* :  scabbard. His colleague here has got a large pistol. So we've stopped on the edge of the hilltop,
*29:22.240- 29:26.120* :  and we're looking down to an extensive network of Palestinian villages,
*29:27.100- 29:31.160* :  there's a few farms and terracing. When you see this view, what does it say to you?
*29:31.800- 29:37.140* :  Sorry if they get up. Well, I see our troubles, our enemies. The Palestinians?
*29:37.140- 29:41.040* :  Yeah. Why can't you live with them peacefully?
*29:42.560- 29:47.320* :  I died the high resolution. Would you live in peace with somebody just trying to kill you for 50 years?
*29:48.220- 29:52.880* :  You both got weapons. I mean, why is it necessary to have those things? Is it that dangerous here
*29:52.880- 29:59.000* :  for you? Megadol. At the moment, we're using these weapons for self-defense, but we hope soon that
*29:59.000- 30:06.440* :  it will be for attacking whoever's not holding a weapon in my opinion is untrue to himself
*30:06.440- 30:12.020* :  in this time of war between Israel and the Ismailites, the Arabs.
*30:12.060- 30:12.840* :  I mean, yeah.
*30:15.620- 30:22.460* :  Israeli nighttime raids to arrest people are very, very common in the West Bank and they've been
*30:22.460- 30:29.360* :  stepped up since this emergency started. With the arrests, always comes a military operation
*30:30.280- 30:37.500* :  and often quite a bit of violence, so where we're heading now is on the edge of Ramallah. There's
*30:37.500- 30:44.800* :  a refugee camp called Jalazoon where two people were killed during an arrest operation and they're
*30:44.800- 30:54.200* :  being buried. In the funeral procession, hundreds and hundreds of mostly young men walking behind the
*30:55.800- 31:00.800* :  the two bodies, many flags of different Palestinian organizations,
*31:01.740- 31:07.800* :  fighter the dominant faction in the West Bank, also Hamas, and Palestinian national flags.
*31:08.900- 31:14.100* :  A small group of women, relatives of the dead, were standing at the back of the big crowd of
*31:14.100- 31:21.580* :  men and boys who come to mourn and show some defiance. With them was Haithamara, a member of the
*31:21.580- 31:27.820* :  Revolutionary Council of Fata, who works at the Human Rights Unit at the Ministry of the Interior.
*31:28.320- 31:34.800* :  The word must be attention that the Israelis they shoot that he was directly and to the heads,
*31:35.400- 31:40.580* :  so this is the message that the Israelis they are announcing were not just only in Gaza but
*31:41.700- 31:46.300* :  everywhere in the Palestinian land. What did you think when you heard Hamas had attacked Israel and
*31:46.300- 31:52.580* :  killed all those people? I will not answer this. The message that comes from,
*31:52.580- 31:56.860* :  particularly from allies of Israel, from the Americans, from the British and so on,
*31:57.580- 32:03.520* :  is that it's not a war against the Palestinian people, it's a war against Hamas,
*32:04.840- 32:09.300* :  but at times like this, distinctions like that don't matter much.
*32:12.500- 32:17.440* :  That was Jeremy Bowen in the West Bank and we finished the podcast with the news of the death
*32:17.440- 32:22.600* :  of Richard Roundtree, the American actor best known for his starring role as detective John
*32:22.600- 32:28.720* :  Shaft in the Shaft film franchise. He died at his home in Los Angeles from pancreatic cancer.
*32:28.980- 32:32.160* :  He was 81. Judy Franco looks back at his life.
*32:41.640- 32:46.280* :  With its Oscar-winning theme song by Isaac Hayes, John Shaft, the super cool and street-wise
*32:46.280- 32:51.280* :  New York detective with his broadness stars and trademark brown leather coat made Richard
*32:51.280- 32:57.940* :  Roundtree a star. He was dubbed the first black action hero and became one of the faces of the
*32:57.940- 33:04.500* :  1970s black exploitation movement, a genre of action film primarily aimed at an urban African-American
*33:04.500- 33:11.600* :  audience. The film which came out in 1971 was originally conceived to be fronted by a white actor,
*33:11.960- 33:17.700* :  but the director Gordon Parks insisted on casting Roundtree, saying he was the most sophisticated
*33:17.700- 33:23.760* :  smooth person he'd ever met. Roundtree was just 28 at the time and had been working as a model
*33:23.760- 33:29.440* :  before joining a black theatre company. He went on to make two Shaft sequels and appeared in
*33:29.440- 33:35.940* :  dozens of other films and TV series, including Roots, the 1977 landmark show about the history
*33:35.940- 33:41.680* :  of slavery. Roundtree reprieved his role as Shaft in a 2000 film of the same name, starring Samuel
*33:41.680- 33:49.440* :  L. Jackson as his nephew, as well as a Netflix film in 2019 that continued the franchise. Samuel
*33:49.440- 33:54.580* :  L. Jackson was one of the first to pay tribute on social media, saying his death left a deep
*33:54.580- 33:59.460* :  hole in his heart. That was Judy Franco looking back at the life of Richard Roundtree.
*34:02.280- 34:06.840* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
