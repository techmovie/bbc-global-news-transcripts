*00:52.360- 00:53.680* :  We charge you a little.
*00:54.020- 00:56.760* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices
*00:56.760- 01:00.020* :  due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices
*01:00.160- 01:01.380* :  due to not hating you.

*01:52.720- 01:56.040* :  Is this the start of Israel's ground invasion of Gaza?
*02:02.720- 02:05.660* :  The Israelis step up airstrikes and begin their biggest
*02:05.660- 02:08.060* :  to ground offensive since the Hamas attacks.
*02:08.740- 02:11.360* :  Mobile phone and internet has been cut off.
*02:12.120- 02:14.500* :  At the UN, the General Assembly votes overwhelmingly
*02:14.500- 02:17.720* :  to call for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza.
*02:18.200- 02:20.200* :  But the Israeli ambassador is outraged.
*02:22.880- 02:25.860* :  Also in the podcast, officials in the US state of Maine
*02:25.860- 02:29.240* :  lift a stay at home order following Wednesday's mass shooting.
*02:29.240- 02:34.140* :  And later, we are a better country because a reality that everyone
*02:34.140- 02:37.300* :  knew about for many years but nobody talked about
*02:37.960- 02:38.900* :  has been made known.
*02:39.460- 02:42.860* :  An investigation in Spain reveals the scale of historic child
*02:42.860- 02:44.820* :  sex abuse in the Catholic Church.
*02:50.140- 02:53.380* :  Nearly three weeks after Hamas fighters poured out of Gaza
*02:53.380- 02:55.220* :  and went on a murderous rampage,
*02:55.220- 02:57.580* :  Israel has launched its heaviest attacks yet
*02:57.580- 02:58.900* :  on the Palestinian territory.
*03:05.520- 03:08.220* :  Flashes and explosions lit up the night sky
*03:08.220- 03:09.680* :  as missiles rained down.
*03:09.740- 03:13.080* :  Mobile phone networks and the internet were cut off.
*03:13.080- 03:17.700* :  Perhaps more significantly after two nights of probing raids into Gaza,
*03:18.060- 03:21.560* :  the Israeli military said it was stepping up its ground attacks.
*03:21.880- 03:24.220* :  Daniel Hagari is the Israeli army spokesman.
*03:27.740- 03:30.740* :  In the last few hours, we've intensified the attacks in Gaza.
*03:31.380- 03:34.560* :  The Air Force has been conducting extensive strikes on tunnels
*03:34.560- 03:36.640* :  and other terrorist infrastructure.
*03:37.380- 03:39.960* :  And in addition to the attacks carried out in the last few days,
*03:40.440- 03:43.040* :  ground forces are expanding their operations tonight.
*03:43.040- 03:46.180* :  The military is operating powerfully on all dimensions
*03:46.400- 03:48.620* :  in order to achieve the goals of the war.
*03:50.160- 03:55.400* :  Hamas' armed wing later confirmed it was engaged in combat with Israeli forces.
*03:56.140- 03:59.880* :  Israel once again told residents of Gaza City and the north of the strip
*03:59.880- 04:02.080* :  to move south for their own safety.
*04:02.080- 04:06.240* :  Our international editor Jeremy Bowen in Jerusalem gave this assessment to
*04:06.240- 04:07.080* :  Louis von Jans.
*04:07.440- 04:10.980* :  Some responses come in to the Israeli actions.
*04:11.080- 04:15.460* :  The Palestinian Authority, which is the rival Palestinian group to Hamas,
*04:15.460- 04:17.300* :  is called this unhinged aggression.
*04:17.300- 04:21.040* :  There are some who are hoping internationally and in Israel
*04:21.040- 04:26.700* :  that perhaps the PA could be persuaded to at a future date take over in Gaza.
*04:27.200- 04:30.560* :  If and when Israel managed to get rid of Hamas there,
*04:31.140- 04:32.740* :  they certainly have been saying consistently.
*04:32.740- 04:35.440* :  They don't want to go in there on the back of an Israeli tank.
*04:35.440- 04:40.020* :  One question in my mind was, is this going to be the big invasion
*04:40.020- 04:41.460* :  that everybody is talking about?
*04:41.900- 04:45.900* :  And what they seem to be doing is to be trying to go into the north,
*04:46.360- 04:50.080* :  maybe consolidate there and perhaps then move further south.
*04:50.700- 04:54.840* :  So Regev said they will continue to be on the receiving end
*04:55.360- 04:58.980* :  of our military blows until we have dismantled their military machine
*04:59.640- 05:02.160* :  and dissolved their political structure in Gaza.
*05:02.680- 05:04.980* :  When this is over, Gaza will be very different.
*05:05.020- 05:10.360* :  So based on what he's saying there, he seems to have answered my question to myself
*05:10.360- 05:14.080* :  about whether this is the ground invasion.
*05:14.820- 05:18.100* :  Absolutely seems to be because he's saying this will continue
*05:18.100- 05:19.740* :  until they've achieved their objectives.
*05:20.280- 05:25.200* :  And just to remind you, the stated is really objective,
*05:25.200- 05:28.740* :  which has come from many ministers in the government
*05:28.740- 05:32.520* :  and the Prime Minister too, I think the phrase is something like,
*05:33.020- 05:34.960* :  why per mass off the face of the earth?
*05:35.140- 05:41.800* :  And we heard the IDF spokesperson talking about the increase in intensification
*05:41.900- 05:47.200* :  but attacked specifically on underground Hamas targets,
*05:48.100- 05:49.520* :  terrorist infrastructure.
*05:50.600- 05:52.960* :  Can you just talk us through how that happens?
*05:53.440- 05:58.460* :  Hamas have been digging tunnels by Comuncan Centre and also by
*05:58.460- 06:01.520* :  that some have been seen and some of the hostages,
*06:01.520- 06:03.580* :  the four who got out and talked about that,
*06:04.600- 06:06.300* :  that they've been digging this network of tunnels.
*06:06.300- 06:08.900* :  Some people said it could be hundreds of kilometers long
*06:08.900- 06:10.360* :  under this very small area.
*06:11.020- 06:13.600* :  The Israelis did a briefing this afternoon
*06:13.660- 06:16.680* :  where they said there were even bunkers underneath
*06:17.500- 06:20.700* :  the main hospital in Gaza City, Shifa,
*06:21.520- 06:23.640* :  where thousands of people have taken refuge.
*06:23.640- 06:27.400* :  The Israelis say that includes quite a lot of the Hamas people
*06:27.720- 06:29.260* :  who went over the border of those government,
*06:29.620- 06:32.060* :  who went over their killing and taking hostages.
*06:32.700- 06:36.740* :  So, Israel says it's going after these bunkers.
*06:36.740- 06:40.920* :  Now, what they're also going to be doing is massively increasing
*06:41.760- 06:44.300* :  the level of military action, of violence,
*06:44.300- 06:46.580* :  directed at the Gaza Strip.
*06:46.940- 06:52.040* :  And while Israel has said to people in the northern part of the Gaza Strip
*06:52.360- 06:55.140* :  that they need to leave and go south and a lot of people have,
*06:55.820- 06:57.100* :  a lot of people haven't too.
*06:57.440- 06:59.580* :  And because humanitarian conditions in the south,
*06:59.580- 07:03.060* :  where the Israelis have let in very few supplies,
*07:03.680- 07:05.640* :  because of the lack of facilities there,
*07:05.960- 07:07.920* :  some people have gone back up north to their homes.
*07:08.400- 07:11.720* :  So, there are lots of civilians in that area where they're operating,
*07:11.720- 07:16.600* :  who must be having an extremely terrifying and rough night,
*07:16.600- 07:22.060* :  and they will undoubtedly be even heavier civilian casualties
*07:22.080- 07:24.840* :  than they've been up to now in the three weeks of bombing.
*07:24.840- 07:29.140* :  Now, that is important, not just because it's the loss of life.
*07:30.040- 07:32.080* :  It's important, too, because of the effect.
*07:32.080- 07:35.920* :  It has in driving the responses to the conflict.
*07:36.800- 07:43.380* :  And the very heavy number of Palestinians who've been killed by Israel,
*07:44.100- 07:48.320* :  I think, for some, even among Israel's allies,
*07:48.880- 07:51.480* :  has eroded the legitimacy of what they're doing.
*07:52.240- 07:56.240* :  Perhaps that's why Israel has decided finally to act on the ground,
*07:56.380- 08:00.140* :  because they sensed, I think, that the mounting casualty figures
*08:01.020- 08:04.860* :  were bringing up more and more pressure for a ceasefire.
*08:05.500- 08:11.220* :  Jeremy Bowen in Jerusalem, while the exact details of what's happening in Gaza aren't known,
*08:11.220- 08:15.640* :  our correspondent in southern Israel, Lucy Williamson, told us it was clear
*08:15.640- 08:18.260* :  that the Israeli bombardment is gaining momentum.
*08:18.620- 08:23.780* :  Well, here in Ashkelon, we have been witnessing this intensification of the bombardment of Gaza,
*08:23.780- 08:26.860* :  and it does feel like an intensification.
*08:26.860- 08:31.120* :  There was another explosion just a couple of minutes ago.
*08:31.120- 08:36.800* :  We've heard them all through tonight, explosions, aerial bombardment of Gaza.
*08:36.800- 08:38.620* :  Some of them louder than usual.
*08:38.620- 08:44.480* :  We've heard planes going back and forth over the town of Ashkelon all this evening.
*08:44.480- 08:48.980* :  Again, they're still passing overhead every minute or two at the moment,
*08:49.380- 08:52.060* :  and there have been sirens here as well tonight several times.
*08:52.060- 08:57.180* :  Warning of rockets incoming from Gaza being fired towards Ashkelon.
*08:57.460- 09:00.500* :  Most of those are intercepted by Israel's defenses,
*09:00.500- 09:06.220* :  but two of them did manage to get through and hit a residential area here in Ashkelon.
*09:06.220- 09:09.820* :  That was confirmed that, in fact, the city amongst others is being targeted.
*09:09.820- 09:13.280* :  So it does feel like there is an intensification underway,
*09:13.280- 09:18.820* :  but as you say, information from the ground in Gaza isn't entirely clear.
*09:18.820- 09:25.200* :  And in fact, the Israeli army hasn't been entirely clear about its aims on the ground in Gaza either.
*09:25.520- 09:30.220* :  It has said it's intensifying airstrikes and it said it's expanding ground operations.
*09:30.300- 09:33.520* :  But exactly what that means isn't entirely clear.
*09:33.520- 09:38.140* :  How big a ground offensive that might mean whether it's targeted raids
*09:38.140- 09:40.380* :  or whether it's the start of something much wider.
*09:40.900- 09:45.020* :  They have set out some clear goals for a military operation.
*09:45.100- 09:49.100* :  They said they want to destroy Hamas as a military unit,
*09:49.100- 09:51.200* :  and also it's powered to govern.
*09:51.200- 09:53.020* :  They want to eradicate it.
*09:53.340- 10:00.100* :  But beyond that, it's very difficult to get a clear sense of what the plan is for the day after.
*10:00.480- 10:03.500* :  And as I say, even at the moment, there's speculation about
*10:03.920- 10:06.660* :  if and when a major ground offensive might start,
*10:06.660- 10:09.080* :  Israel certainly seems to have been preparing for one
*10:09.080- 10:12.440* :  with hundreds of thousands of troops lined up along its borders.
*10:12.940- 10:16.040* :  But even that, at the moment, is still largely speculation.
*10:16.200- 10:18.780* :  We don't have any confirmation from Israel's army
*10:19.160- 10:20.940* :  about what it's planning to do on the ground tonight.
*10:21.520- 10:24.540* :  Lucy Williamson in Ashkelon in Southern Israel.
*10:24.540- 10:27.480* :  For its part, Hamas has called on the world to quote,
*10:27.480- 10:30.700* :  act immediately to stop the Israeli bombardment.
*10:30.700- 10:33.740* :  The Israeli offensive in Gaza also triggered protests
*10:33.740- 10:37.000* :  in the other Palestinian territory, the occupied West Bank.
*10:39.420- 10:41.640* :  The Israeli bombardment.
*10:48.080- 10:52.120* :  Meanwhile, on the diplomatic front, the Jordanian foreign minister warned Israel
*10:52.120- 10:54.540* :  that an invasion of Gaza would spell, quote,
*10:54.540- 10:56.120* :  catastrophe for years.
*10:56.940- 11:01.760* :  At the UN, more than 100 nations voted to support a resolution from Arab countries
*11:01.760- 11:04.560* :  to call for an immediate humanitarian truce.
*11:04.740- 11:08.320* :  The Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Reed Mansor, welcomed the move.
*11:08.940- 11:12.600* :  The General Assembly prevailed and sent the appropriate message,
*11:13.160- 11:17.460* :  not only to the Palestinian people, that there is justice and fairness,
*11:18.160- 11:21.920* :  and internationally humanitarian law upholded by the General Assembly.
*11:22.720- 11:25.560* :  But also, it sent the message to everyone.
*11:25.920- 11:26.760* :  Enough is enough.
*11:26.760- 11:28.320* :  This war has to stop.
*11:28.320- 11:31.420* :  The carnage against our people has to stop.
*11:32.000- 11:35.040* :  Only 14 countries voted against the resolution,
*11:35.140- 11:39.780* :  and the Israeli ambassador Gilad Erdan said the UN had failed in its duty.
*11:40.680- 11:44.360* :  Today is a day that will go down in infamy.
*11:45.320- 11:52.020* :  We have all witnessed that the UN no longer holds even one ounce of legitimacy or relevance.
*11:53.240- 11:56.340* :  This organization was founded in the wake of the Holocaust
*11:56.740- 11:59.320* :  for the purpose of preventing atrocities.
*12:00.080- 12:04.260* :  Yet, the spectacle we just saw proves, beyond a doubt,
*12:04.300- 12:12.060* :  that the UN is committed, sadly, tragically, not to preventing but ensuring further atrocities.
*12:12.280- 12:16.660* :  We got more details from our correspondent at the UN in New York, Nettafik.
*12:17.080- 12:21.580* :  It's important to remember that the General Assembly is where the weight of world
*12:21.580- 12:27.160* :  opinion is really reflected, because every nation has the same weight of vote.
*12:27.160- 12:31.800* :  There's no vetoes, and that's very different to say the Security Council,
*12:31.800- 12:35.040* :  where five permanent members do have veto power.
*12:35.500- 12:41.420* :  And so, when a decision is made by the General Assembly, it has political weight, moral weight.
*12:42.220- 12:47.740* :  So, I think that is the significance on one hand, on the other, because it's not legally binding,
*12:48.660- 12:54.800* :  they don't have the same kind of consequential outcomes that Security Council resolutions can have.
*12:55.380- 13:00.040* :  And so, while many are celebrating those who supported this resolution, the outcome,
*13:00.980- 13:07.400* :  they do know that it's not likely to change Israel's course on the ground on its own.
*13:08.160- 13:14.300* :  Give us a breakdown of who voted for or against, and what that means for the relative support
*13:14.300- 13:16.880* :  that Israel and the Palestinians have at the moment.
*13:17.360- 13:22.640* :  Well, where we really saw the divisions was the United States, Israel's staunchest ally voted
*13:22.640- 13:25.820* :  against this, there was no real surprise there.
*13:25.820- 13:32.040* :  But then we saw also Canada, the UK, and several European nations abstaining.
*13:32.040- 13:38.920* :  Now, Canada had put forward an amendment to the resolution that specifically condemned Hamas
*13:38.920- 13:46.340* :  in name for the October 7th attacks and called for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages.
*13:46.740- 13:53.260* :  Now, the draft of the resolution did have language talking about freeing all civilians,
*13:53.260- 13:59.720* :  it mentioned grave concern about the region since the October 7th attacks, but it didn't
*13:59.720- 14:05.960* :  explicitly name Hamas. But the authors had argued successfully in the chamber because the
*14:05.960- 14:11.820* :  amendment failed that they didn't blame Israel either. So, it was either blaming both Hamas
*14:11.820- 14:17.420* :  and Israel in the text or keeping it strictly humanitarian. But several European nations did
*14:17.420- 14:24.180* :  support it, and we heard them talk about the importance of war itself as well, having rules,
*14:24.860- 14:29.940* :  although everybody was unequivocal in condemning Hamas in their statements.
*14:30.560- 14:35.600* :  Now, that's Talfique in New York. We'll bring you the latest developments in the Hamas
*14:35.600- 14:40.380* :  Israel conflicts in our next edition of the Global News Podcast this time.
*14:40.380- 14:45.000* :  Tomorrow, but if you go to your Global News Podcast feed, wherever you get your podcasts,
*14:45.000- 14:49.980* :  you'll find we have a special edition answering your questions about the war.
*14:50.660- 14:55.840* :  Other news now, and more than 200,000 people were abused by Catholic priests in Spain
*14:55.840- 15:01.080* :  over the past decades. A similar number were abused by non-clarical members of the church.
*15:01.100- 15:04.980* :  Those are both according to an independent commission in the country.
*15:05.240- 15:10.080* :  The Catholic Church has already been rocked by abuse scandals in the US, France, Australia,
*15:10.080- 15:14.860* :  and elsewhere. But until recently, the issue had been kept quiet in Spain,
*15:14.860- 15:21.020* :  and church leaders were criticized in the Ombudsman's report. Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro
*15:21.020- 15:24.680* :  Sanchez said it was important that the abuse had finally been brought to light.
*15:27.800- 15:32.800* :  It's a milestone in our country's democracy, because what it's not talked about does not exist.
*15:33.840- 15:39.420* :  For many years, many people have suffered because they could not report, explain themselves,
*15:39.660- 15:45.720* :  or make human dramas visible. We are a better country, because a reality that everyone
*15:45.720- 15:51.220* :  knew about for many years, but nobody talked about, at least not in the terms that we're doing,
*15:51.220- 15:53.560* :  so today, has been made known.
*15:56.200- 16:00.580* :  Ah, Madrid, correspondent Gaya Hedgeko told me how the commission had worked out the estimate
*16:00.580- 16:04.820* :  for the number of people abused by the church in Spain. They came to this figure by
*16:04.920- 16:12.200* :  carrying out a poll on 8,000 Spaniards and asking them about their experiences of sexual abuse
*16:12.860- 16:17.200* :  in relation to the Catholic Church. If you extrapolate that the findings they have,
*16:17.200- 16:23.780* :  then you come to this figure of 230,000 Spaniards who would have been sexual abused
*16:23.780- 16:29.980* :  during their childhood, directly by members of the clergy. Now, if you broaden that out to people
*16:29.980- 16:35.780* :  who have suffered some kind of sexual abuse by members of the Catholic Church and also
*16:35.780- 16:42.720* :  through its institutions such as schools, then that number rises to around 440,000 people.
*16:42.720- 16:48.280* :  We don't have an official response from the church yet. The Ombudsman, he did mention the fact
*16:48.280- 16:53.960* :  that in some cases they had not cooperated, and then he talked about the attitude of the church,
*16:53.980- 17:00.360* :  the way it had handled these many thousands of cases over the decades, and he said in so many
*17:00.360- 17:05.420* :  cases they had downplayed these cases or tried to cover them up, essentially.
*17:05.840- 17:10.660* :  Now, the Catholic Church has played an extremely important role in the running of the state,
*17:10.660- 17:15.760* :  not least during the Franco era. What sits image-like at the moment and what's likely to happen
*17:15.760- 17:20.780* :  to it as a result of this report? Well, the Spanish Parliament, which commissioned this report
*17:20.780- 17:26.680* :  last year, is due to debate the findings of this report in the coming weeks, but I think that
*17:26.680- 17:31.400* :  could be fairly crucial. And it's interesting to look at the different attitudes of the different
*17:31.400- 17:37.220* :  political parties. There was support for this report to be drawn up almost across the board
*17:37.220- 17:43.380* :  with the exception of the far right vox party, and that, to a certain extent, reflects what you see
*17:43.380- 17:49.380* :  in Spanish society with regard to the Catholic Church, that people on the left, the parties on the
*17:49.380- 17:55.360* :  left tend to be much more critical of the Catholic Church than Spaniards on the right and the political
*17:55.360- 18:00.460* :  parties on the right. So I think there will be a very lively debate about the findings of this
*18:00.460- 18:05.840* :  report in Congress, and the big question is what comes out of that? Will there be legislation
*18:05.840- 18:12.240* :  that comes out of that or measures which have been recommended in this report? Guy Hedgeko in Madrid.
*18:13.220- 18:17.880* :  For nearly 48 hours, police and the US state of Maine have been searching for an army
*18:17.880- 18:21.920* :  reservist suspected of being behind a mass shooting at a bowling alley and bar.
*18:22.720- 18:27.920* :  And while the authorities say they are still looking for Robert Card, they have lifted a stay at
*18:27.920- 18:33.360* :  home order in Lewiston. At least 18 people were killed there and 13 others wounded in the shootings
*18:33.360- 18:39.980* :  on Wednesday evening. The victims were aged between 14 and 76. They included many local deaf people
*18:40.020- 18:44.240* :  who'd been attending an event at the bar. Our correspondent Nomi Igbo has the latest.
*18:44.980- 18:51.700* :  So why rescind this order which takes effect from tomorrow if they don't think the public is at risk?
*18:51.700- 18:56.780* :  Well, the police think that answers pretty straightforward in the sense that a lot of people in
*18:56.780- 19:03.440* :  Lewiston and in the towns nearby like Lisbon and Bowden have been really frustrated and confused
*19:03.440- 19:09.280* :  about what to do. Can they leave? Can they go to school? Can they go to college? Can they go and
*19:09.280- 19:14.580* :  open their businesses? And so it's been a delicate balance for them to keep the public safe,
*19:14.700- 19:21.060* :  but also for people to just be able to get on with their lives. So that is why they've decided to
*19:21.060- 19:27.260* :  rescind the stay at home order. But what they're saying to people stay vigilant, it's still dangerous
*19:27.280- 19:32.040* :  out there because this gunman still hasn't been found. The search continues for him.
*19:32.300- 19:36.360* :  Yeah, I mean, there've been various rumours, but take us through what we can say about the search.
*19:36.760- 19:42.260* :  Well, at the moment, they are focusing on a specific part of the main river, the Andresgoggen river
*19:42.260- 19:47.720* :  that goes through Maine. It's an area, a specific area where they found his car, so they're focusing
*19:47.720- 19:54.580* :  on that. Divers are going into the river. There were reports that he had left a suicide note. So
*19:54.580- 20:00.100* :  we know a note was found as a property linked to him. And we asked in the press conference a
*20:00.100- 20:05.300* :  short while ago, was that a suicide note, but they wouldn't confirm that. So we're still no
*20:05.300- 20:09.400* :  clear on that, but as far as their concerns, the search is still ongoing.
*20:15.620- 20:19.400* :  And still to come on the global news podcast. Won't they get into trouble?
*20:20.480- 20:27.240* :  No, no, nothing to be tense about. Brother, are you sure? We take people daily, so we know.
*20:28.180- 20:33.940* :  An undercover BBC team investigates how people smugglers use social media to lure migrants.
*20:34.880- 20:39.180* :  Before we move on, here's Andrew Peach with news of the latest happy pod.
*20:39.560- 20:45.040* :  Yes, this week a study from Shanghai looking at how Tai Chi can help people with Parkinson's.
*20:45.340- 20:50.080* :  A tortoise called Frank found roaming in the spinach fields of British Columbia in Canada,
*20:50.620- 20:55.580* :  how the computer game football manager has helped the national side in the African nation of Guinea
*20:55.580- 21:02.100* :  Visao, and the happiest person in the happiest country on Earth. Finland, please join me for half an
*21:02.100- 21:07.500* :  hour of positive uplifting news stories in the happy pod available in this feed every Saturday.
*21:12.640- 21:17.080* :  An update now on a story we brought you on Wednesday, the devastation caused by the most
*21:17.080- 21:22.520* :  powerful storm ever to strike Mexico's Pacific coast. Hurricane Otis slammed into the resort
*21:22.520- 21:28.960* :  of Acaporco with winds of more than 260 kilometres an hour. In the immediate aftermath of the storm,
*21:28.960- 21:34.680* :  it was hard to get a clear picture from the affected area, but we now know at least 27 people died.
*21:34.700- 21:41.120* :  Looting has broken out and the Mexican president has promised government help. Rachel Wright reports.
*21:46.160- 21:50.880* :  The ferocity of Hurricane Otis caught everyone by surprise when it hit the once glamorous
*21:50.880- 21:56.380* :  resort of Acaporco, where the forecasters had predicted winds of around 90 kilometres an hour.
*21:56.760- 22:03.100* :  Instead, they reached 260. The world meteorological organisation described the hurricane as one of
*22:03.100- 22:09.340* :  the most rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones on record. 80 percent of the resort's hotels were
*22:09.340- 22:14.740* :  damaged and streets flooded. Videos showed facades of buildings ripped off and roads strewn with
*22:14.740- 22:21.280* :  debris. Andra Maria Vadova was in her apartment when Hurricane Otis struck. After a couple of minutes
*22:21.280- 22:27.760* :  of shaking the door, I was able to open it. I walk into the hallway. I go to the living room and I
*22:27.760- 22:36.100* :  literally see the couch going out the window. I was in shock and I was barefooted. There was glass
*22:36.100- 22:45.260* :  everywhere. The wind was so powerful, so intense. The Ministry of Defence said 8,000 soldiers had
*22:45.260- 22:50.620* :  been deployed to Acaporco and towns along the coast to help with the clear-up. It's estimated that
*22:50.620- 22:55.940* :  around 1 million people have been left without electricity and water. There are also reports of
*22:55.940- 23:01.580* :  widespread looting. The Mexican government said on Friday it had now restored 50 percent of the
*23:01.580- 23:06.780* :  electricity service in Guerrero State, one of the country's poorest, and that it would be setting up
*23:06.780- 23:13.020* :  an air bridge between Acaporco and Mexico City to evacuate stranded tourists. Rachel Wright.
*23:14.100- 23:19.520* :  Hundreds of thousands of people have left Pakistan this year to find better economic opportunities
*23:19.520- 23:24.600* :  abroad. Many of them are lured by people's smugglers advertising illegal routes to get to
*23:24.600- 23:29.640* :  Europe on social media. A BBC team went under cover to speak to one of the smugglers. BBC
*23:29.640- 23:35.580* :  Trending's Reha Kansara has this report. There is nothing to be worried about, brother.
*23:36.540- 23:43.280* :  18-year-old, 12-year-old. We also take guys this age. The thing is, you have to be calm and
*23:43.280- 23:50.320* :  compose. You're listening to a people's smuggler from Pakistan. He's attempting to
*23:50.320- 23:55.460* :  sell a route to Italy from Qoyta in Pakistan to an undercover BBC journalist.
*23:59.180- 24:05.240* :  Won't they get into trouble? No, nothing to be tensed about. Brother, are you sure?
*24:05.240- 24:14.040* :  We take people daily so we know they cross the border on foot. Then we take them in a truck and
*24:14.040- 24:19.220* :  we're sitting around. This smuggler is just one of many operating out of the country,
*24:19.220- 24:25.220* :  falsely promising people's safe passage to Europe and promoting illegal routes on social media.
*24:25.940- 24:31.300* :  From Turkey to Italy, the smuggler says the so-called game, a term used to describe illicit
*24:31.300- 24:37.640* :  journeys from Pakistan to Europe, will cost just over $7,000 US dollars. We don't pay him,
*24:38.300- 24:44.400* :  but he offers some advice on how to get to the UK. Brother, I can tell you that from Italy,
*24:44.400- 24:49.860* :  people go to France and from France, people execute games for London and elsewhere.
*24:50.300- 24:56.320* :  We found him via a group on Facebook, which described itself as a travel agent. It's posts
*24:56.320- 25:01.720* :  regularly linked to a WhatsApp group with the same name, where, on the encrypted messaging app,
*25:01.720- 25:08.520* :  smugglers and potential customers interact. Even if he gets caught, he's only going to end up
*25:08.700- 25:14.680* :  back at home. No one is going to kidnap him and ask for ransom. Can the smugglers' assurances
*25:14.680- 25:19.980* :  be trusted, though? The risks are enormous for those who take the illegal route smugglers are
*25:25.420- 25:29.640* :  offering. Sayyid, who I met in Italy, is a young man from Pakistani-administered Kashmir,
*25:30.180- 25:35.580* :  who made the perilous journey to Europe by boat from Libya ten months ago, after being held
*25:35.580- 25:44.160* :  to ransom by the Libyan Mafia. When some of us tried to escape, they had surveillance cameras
*25:44.160- 25:49.560* :  everywhere, and they caught us. They made us stand against a wall, and then they started beating
*25:49.560- 25:56.400* :  us. Two of them would beat us so badly we couldn't walk. After that, they stripped us of our clothes.
*25:56.400- 26:01.240* :  It felt as if it was the last day of my life. I thought they would kill us.
*26:04.240- 26:09.960* :  In total, he spent over ten thousand US dollars to get to Europe. Using the same smuggler,
*26:09.960- 26:16.360* :  a friend used some months back. They told my brother they were charging more because it was a big
*26:16.360- 26:23.420* :  ship, but that was a lie. It was a fishing boat. We put our evidence to meta and TikTok that
*26:23.420- 26:28.560* :  their platforms are being used to promote illegal people smuggling. Both companies took down almost
*26:28.560- 26:33.720* :  all content we reported to them, and they say they are continuously looking for ways to remove
*26:33.720- 26:41.240* :  this type of content. Some days after we spoke to the smuggler, we ring him again. This time,
*26:41.300- 26:46.040* :  revealing we are BBC journalists. A colleague from BBC Ordo makes the call.
*26:48.220- 26:50.140* :  You do know how dangerous this is, right?
*26:54.500- 27:00.100* :  The smuggler hangs up. In fact, days later, we find him advertising another illegal route to
*27:00.100- 27:03.940* :  Europe. Clearly, a call from the BBC has not deterred him.
*27:06.360- 27:10.940* :  It's not often that we get to speak to a double Olympic gold medalist, but the former captain
*27:10.940- 27:15.720* :  of the Canadian women's ice hockey team Cassie Campbell Pascal joined me a little earlier to talk
*27:15.720- 27:21.400* :  about a new BBC World Service podcast she's presenting, called Amazing Sports Stories.
*27:21.400- 27:27.100* :  The first three episodes take us back to a young girl's battle for sporting equality in the 1980s,
*27:27.220- 27:33.260* :  in a mini series called Frozen Out. This first story is about Justin Blaney, who is a great
*27:33.260- 27:38.760* :  Canadian hockey player that fought to play boys hockey when she was around 12 years old, and
*27:39.260- 27:44.520* :  she initially lost her case in the Ontario Supreme Court, but ended up winning her next case
*27:45.020- 27:50.480* :  in the Court of Appeal in 1986. It was a really big news story here in Canada, just about a young
*27:50.480- 27:56.420* :  girl fighting to play boys hockey. Now, you're an ice hockey player yourself. Is that what attracted
*27:56.420- 28:01.500* :  you to that story? Definitely. I mean, it was Justin and I are the same age, and we actually
*28:01.500- 28:07.880* :  played against each other. I think at the time, just based on numbers, boys got to have to play
*28:07.880- 28:12.560* :  in better leagues. They had more teams to play against. There was teams maybe closer to people's
*28:12.560- 28:18.400* :  homes, and it was a little bit more convenient at times to play. There was a real sense that you
*28:18.400- 28:23.640* :  had to prove that the girl's game was good at this time, and I've got an opportunity to play
*28:23.640- 28:28.100* :  with Justin over the years and get a chance to know her, but to honestly sit down and tell this
*28:28.100- 28:34.360* :  story, I don't think I realized at the time, all the things that she went through just to play hockey
*28:34.360- 28:40.020* :  and to play with her brother and to play in the MTHL, which was close to her home, and for me,
*28:40.020- 28:46.320* :  it was just about hearing what she went through to kind of push this through the courts and being
*28:46.320- 28:52.020* :  a young child in really what was an adult world of the legal system, and she stuck to her beliefs,
*28:52.220- 28:56.760* :  and she ends up eventually winning the appeal and it's a big story in our country.
*28:57.200- 29:03.280* :  Cassie Campbell Pascal and amazing sport stories is available to download on BBC sounds or wherever
*29:03.280- 29:09.600* :  you get your BBC podcasts. Now, it's thought that only humans and a few species of way or go through
*29:09.600- 29:15.100* :  the menopause, but scientists have found that some chimpanzees living in Uganda's Kibali national
*29:15.100- 29:21.220* :  park experience it as well and can live for a lengthy period afterwards. Susan Albert says a
*29:21.220- 29:26.360* :  professor of biology at Duke University in the United States, she spoke to James Menendez about how
*29:26.360- 29:33.100* :  this study could be useful for us humans. I think the paper is surprising, exciting, and puzzling.
*29:33.100- 29:37.540* :  If you had told me about this before I had seen the data, I would have been skeptical.
*29:38.240- 29:43.680* :  Why would you have been skeptical? Was the consensus before that menopause was just not part of
*29:44.360- 29:50.840* :  chimpanzees makeup? Maybe a good way to describe why people might be skeptical is that we think of
*29:50.840- 29:56.640* :  menopause as a trait that's pretty fixed within a species. Either a species shows it or a species
*29:56.640- 30:01.980* :  doesn't show it. And what they've shown here is that there's variation among chimpanzee populations
*30:01.980- 30:07.140* :  in the extent to which they show it. And that's really exciting because even though it's puzzling,
*30:07.140- 30:11.960* :  we don't understand why it would be the case. This is a potential model for what ancient
*30:11.960- 30:16.940* :  humans might have looked like. If you cast back to human ancestors one or two million years ago,
*30:17.780- 30:23.100* :  they too could have had variation among populations in the extent to which females
*30:23.100- 30:29.180* :  showed this trait. And if there's variation in the extent to which a trait is exhibited,
*30:29.680- 30:34.960* :  that means natural selection can act on it. In humans, it looks as though that happened and
*30:34.960- 30:40.920* :  the trait became fixed. Which brings us onto a very important question. Why would it be important
*30:40.920- 30:46.480* :  for a species for the females to go through the menopause? What might be the evolutionary benefit?
*30:47.020- 30:52.320* :  In humans and also in killer whales and pilot whales, one is the grandmother hypothesis.
*30:52.320- 30:58.140* :  And the name of the hypothesis sort of says it all. It's that grandmothers can contribute more
*30:58.140- 31:04.220* :  to their grand offspring than they can by having offspring late in their life that may be vulnerable
*31:04.220- 31:11.640* :  to problems of survival just because the mom is aged. The other hypothesis is that as females age,
*31:11.980- 31:16.580* :  they're increasingly related to other individuals in their social group. And so by not
*31:16.580- 31:22.760* :  producing offspring, they can assist kin that they're related to, you know, on sneezes,
*31:22.760- 31:29.100* :  but not by providing direct care necessarily, just by reducing competition. Now in humans,
*31:29.100- 31:33.640* :  there's pretty good evidence for the grandmother hypothesis, I would say. The evidence for
*31:33.640- 31:39.300* :  reproductive competition is maybe a little bit more mixed. But in chimpanzees, neither of them seems
*31:39.300- 31:45.260* :  entirely convincing, which is why this is such a wonderful puzzle. Susan Albert's talking to James
*31:45.260- 31:52.300* :  Menendez. And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back this time
*31:52.300- 31:57.120* :  tomorrow. This edition was mixed by Joe McCartney and produced by Madeleine Dury by editors
*31:57.120- 32:00.160* :  Karen Martin. I'm all of a con way. Until next time, goodbye.
*32:09.220- 32:14.700* :  From hedge funds to angel investors to bull markets. In the world of finance,
*32:14.700- 32:18.820* :  names can sometimes be a bit misleading. Take ours, for instance.
*32:19.580- 32:25.060* :  LSEG, aka London Stock Exchange Group. We're in London, and we have a stock exchange,
*32:25.060- 32:29.800* :  but that's just part of what we do. Today, we connect the news, information, insights,
*32:29.800- 32:35.580* :  and systems that make the markets work. You see, others do some of what we do, but not
*32:35.580- 32:37.820* :  everything we do. LSEG.
