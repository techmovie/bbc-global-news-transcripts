*02:57.640- 03:00.060* :  The hospital is overloaded now with casualties.
*03:00.940- 03:04.060* :  We can hardly manage actually dealing with the patients.
*03:04.660- 03:07.640* :  The worst problem we have now is leg of supplies now.
*03:07.640- 03:10.920* :  We are running out of the supplies in every term.
*03:11.380- 03:13.740* :  All the medical staff, the doctors, nurses, technicians,
*03:13.740- 03:16.300* :  they are overloaded, exhausted actually.

*03:35.200- 03:36.580* :  This is his latest report.
*03:37.320- 03:41.420* :  Israel have been targeting houses this time according to Hamas.
*03:41.420- 03:44.600* :  Some of the houses are belong to Hamas activists,
*03:45.240- 03:48.360* :  the Hamas government building, Hamas training facility,
*03:48.360- 03:51.860* :  Hamas military compound, even charity organization.
*03:52.480- 03:54.740* :  Hamas banks were also destroyed.
*03:55.080- 03:57.440* :  Any building belong to Hamas wither,
*03:57.840- 04:00.660* :  it's used for the civilian activity
*04:00.660- 04:03.260* :  or military activity have been targeted.
*04:03.260- 04:06.940* :  But we are talking about buildings within a man, neighborhoods
*04:06.940- 04:09.820* :  where thousands of civilians live.
*04:10.280- 04:12.080* :  When they hit the Remal neighborhood,
*04:12.080- 04:16.280* :  which considered for a very long time the safe haven for the people of Gaza,
*04:16.860- 04:19.940* :  they destroyed about 11 residential buildings,
*04:20.580- 04:24.700* :  located next to the Hamas ministries and next to Hamas police station.
*04:24.700- 04:26.900* :  As you know, Hamas is not only a military wing,
*04:27.220- 04:30.380* :  they have been running this place for the last 17 years.
*04:30.380- 04:31.420* :  So they are the government.
*04:31.900- 04:34.080* :  They have police stations, they have institutions,
*04:34.080- 04:37.000* :  they have medical centers, they have everything.
*04:37.740- 04:41.060* :  Some of the buildings are used for Hamas training militants,
*04:41.500- 04:43.580* :  but other buildings were used for civilian.
*04:43.580- 04:46.940* :  We are not talking about buildings located outside the city.
*04:46.940- 04:48.980* :  You know, it's inside the neighborhoods
*04:49.040- 04:50.820* :  where hundreds of people live
*04:51.440- 04:55.720* :  and they all affected by the Israeli air strike targeting Hamas.
*04:56.020- 04:58.080* :  That was Ruchdi Abu Aluf in Gaza.
*04:58.080- 05:01.540* :  Well, Israelis continuing to gather its military forces
*05:01.540- 05:04.300* :  around Gaza and what's being described as preparations
*05:04.300- 05:06.180* :  for a possible ground invasion.
*05:06.840- 05:09.480* :  Tens of thousands of troops and heavy armor being positioned,
*05:09.480- 05:12.160* :  hundreds of thousands of reservists have been called up.
*05:12.660- 05:14.620* :  I spoke to our chief international correspondent,
*05:14.620- 05:17.120* :  Leastu Set, who's in the city of Ashkelon.
*05:17.820- 05:21.380* :  With every day you see the preparations that Israel is making
*05:21.380- 05:25.980* :  for what's believed to be in all but certain ground invasion
*05:26.320- 05:27.280* :  at some point.
*05:27.340- 05:30.820* :  Today we were in the border town of Storot.
*05:30.860- 05:34.820* :  At one point it is less than a mile from Gaza.
*05:34.820- 05:39.500* :  We could see on the horizon the plumes of dark smoke rising
*05:39.500- 05:40.840* :  from Gaza City.
*05:40.840- 05:44.660* :  There was the sound of heavy artillery all through the day,
*05:45.220- 05:47.020* :  artillery firing into Gaza.
*05:47.020- 05:50.280* :  Part of that non-stop bombardment that we hear
*05:50.280- 05:52.860* :  from our reporter there, Ruchdi Abu Aluf.
*05:52.980- 05:56.020* :  But Israel's iron dome system, the air defense system,
*05:56.020- 05:57.900* :  was also in action today.
*05:57.900- 06:00.840* :  Intercepting missiles fired by Hamas.
*06:00.900- 06:04.960* :  So the military side of this war certainly isn't
*06:05.280- 06:07.840* :  letting up and in fact it's intensifying.
*06:08.100- 06:09.940* :  Lisa, wouldn't you pick up on some of the conversations
*06:09.940- 06:12.280* :  you will have heard with people in Storot?
*06:12.280- 06:14.660* :  You've been speaking to civilians and also the mayor there.
*06:14.720- 06:17.580* :  Some of our listeners may know the name of Storot
*06:17.580- 06:19.160* :  because it has been on the front line.
*06:19.500- 06:22.100* :  Every time there is an escalation in violence,
*06:22.680- 06:25.520* :  they always take the brunt of the rockets.
*06:25.520- 06:28.860* :  And I remember decades ago where the rockets that used
*06:28.900- 06:31.940* :  to hit Storot would be crude, handmade missiles.
*06:31.940- 06:34.500* :  That's all that the Hamas fighters had.
*06:35.060- 06:39.980* :  Now decades on, they are raining missiles on the area.
*06:40.600- 06:43.680* :  And we ran in immediately to the mayor of Storot.
*06:43.680- 06:45.140* :  Many people have left, not everyone,
*06:45.140- 06:47.280* :  but the streets were largely deserted.
*06:47.280- 06:51.020* :  And he was calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:51.020- 06:52.780* :  to help him evacuate the town.
*06:53.360- 06:55.820* :  So I asked him what life was like in Storot now.
*06:56.080- 06:57.480* :  This is a dangerous place now
*06:57.520- 06:59.620* :  because we are so close to the border of Gaza.
*06:59.980- 07:02.640* :  You see all the hundreds of the missiles that land
*07:02.640- 07:04.100* :  on the town.
*07:04.100- 07:04.640* :  You see on the injured from the rocket,
*07:04.640- 07:06.180* :  we have people that died from that.
*07:06.340- 07:08.600* :  It's a good for the family that live in Storot
*07:08.640- 07:10.260* :  to be outside from the city.
*07:10.520- 07:11.600* :  People have not left already.
*07:11.600- 07:12.800* :  You have to ask them to leave.
*07:12.940- 07:15.900* :  But imagine if you, you have your family,
*07:15.900- 07:20.140* :  you cannot run or tell for one month from your money.
*07:20.280- 07:21.780* :  This is responsible of the country
*07:21.780- 07:24.160* :  to give them the support that they need.
*07:24.460- 07:26.880* :  That was the voice there of the mayor of the town of Storot,
*07:27.100- 07:29.280* :  speaking to our chief international correspondent,
*07:29.280- 07:30.260* :  Lee Stusset.
*07:31.000- 07:33.220* :  Well, Israel's top general has admitted
*07:33.220- 07:36.260* :  that the country's armed forces failed to predict the state
*07:36.260- 07:39.820* :  and its citizens when Hamas launched its cross-border attack
*07:39.820- 07:40.580* :  on Saturday.
*07:41.120- 07:43.000* :  Joel Headsy-Holevy told reporters
*07:43.000- 07:45.380* :  that the IDF did not live up to its responsibilities
*07:46.040- 07:48.260* :  and that lessons would eventually be learned.
*07:48.820- 07:51.700* :  But the general said that, for now, it was time for war.
*07:51.760- 07:54.880* :  He said Gaza would not look the same when it was over.
*07:55.520- 08:01.060* :  The IDF is responsible for the security of the state
*08:01.060- 08:02.040* :  and its citizens.
*08:02.640- 08:06.460* :  And on Saturday morning, in Otef-Azah, we did not handle it.
*08:06.660- 08:09.740* :  This heinous attack was decided by Yahya Sinwah,
*08:09.740- 08:11.280* :  the ruler of the Gaza Strip.
*08:11.780- 08:15.140* :  And therefore he and all the system below him are mortal.
*08:15.720- 08:16.640* :  We will attack them.
*08:16.940- 08:17.980* :  We will dismantle them.
*08:18.040- 08:19.840* :  We will dismantle their system.
*08:22.620- 08:25.720* :  Well, Israel is still said to be in shock after last weekend's
*08:25.720- 08:29.080* :  unprecedented attack and the murder by Gunman from Hamas
*08:29.540- 08:31.400* :  of at least 1,300 people.
*08:31.600- 08:35.000* :  The perimeter of the Gaza Strip is just 40 kilometres
*08:35.000- 08:36.560* :  or 25 miles long.
*08:37.200- 08:41.100* :  So then how did Hamas manage to carry out such a brazen operation
*08:41.100- 08:43.300* :  taking everyone by complete surprise?
*08:43.940- 08:45.860* :  Well, security correspondent is Gordon Carrera
*08:45.860- 08:47.980* :  and he's been investigating Israel's defence
*08:47.980- 08:49.960* :  of its border with the Gaza Strip.
*08:50.580- 08:53.320* :  Israel had built what it called an iron wall
*08:53.320- 08:54.540* :  around its perimeter.
*08:55.240- 08:57.420* :  That included a high-tech fence
*08:57.920- 09:00.780* :  with defenses extending below ground to block tunnels.
*09:01.300- 09:03.860* :  While above there were observation towers,
*09:03.860- 09:06.980* :  surveillance cameras and sensors to detect movement.
*09:07.240- 09:10.320* :  So just how did Hamas manage to break out?
*09:11.360- 09:13.760* :  It began early Saturday morning with a volley
*09:13.760- 09:16.420* :  of more than 2,000 rockets launched out of Gaza
*09:16.420- 09:18.480* :  sending Israelis racing to their shelters.
*09:18.480- 09:22.740* :  But that was just to provide cover for what else Hamas was doing.
*09:23.080- 09:25.020* :  Commercial drones carrying explosives
*09:25.020- 09:27.340* :  were flown towards the security fence.
*09:27.960- 09:30.900* :  Crucially, they also knocked out communications towers
*09:30.900- 09:33.380* :  and cameras leaving Israel blind.
*09:33.980- 09:35.140* :  With rockets flying overhead,
*09:35.140- 09:38.760* :  Hamas fighters flew out on motorized hang gliders.
*09:38.980- 09:41.840* :  At the same time, explosives were used to blow holes
*09:41.840- 09:43.320* :  in the fence at some locations
*09:43.420- 09:45.660* :  at other places, holes were cut.
*09:46.520- 09:48.940* :  Bulldozers then widened some of the gaps.
*09:48.980- 09:51.940* :  There were dozens of breaches along the entire perimeter.
*09:52.540- 09:55.620* :  This allowed motorbikes and vehicles to flood out.
*09:55.620- 09:59.340* :  At least 1,000 gunmen were now inside Israel.
*10:00.120- 10:01.780* :  They overwhelmed border checkpoints,
*10:02.140- 10:03.940* :  adding to the chaos for Israeli forces
*10:03.940- 10:05.340* :  who were struggling to communicate
*10:05.380- 10:07.160* :  and understand the scale of events.
*10:08.060- 10:10.220* :  This complex attack would have taken months,
*10:10.220- 10:12.160* :  perhaps years of preparation.
*10:12.800- 10:14.980* :  The fact they managed to plan all of this
*10:14.980- 10:18.820* :  without being spotted marks a significant intelligence failure.
*10:19.160- 10:20.860* :  They even deceived Israel into thinking
*10:20.980- 10:23.640* :  they weren't interested in another conflict right now.
*10:24.140- 10:27.200* :  Israeli troops arguably overaligned on technology
*10:27.200- 10:29.940* :  that was now disabled with thinly spread.
*10:30.560- 10:32.500* :  Some gunmen headed to military bases.
*10:32.500- 10:34.600* :  It was Saturday morning and a religious holiday.
*10:35.180- 10:37.040* :  Israeli forces were taken by surprise,
*10:37.040- 10:38.860* :  some soldiers killed in their barracks.
*10:39.740- 10:42.020* :  This all meant that gunmen were able to head
*10:42.020- 10:43.540* :  to other settlements nearby,
*10:44.160- 10:45.920* :  meeting little resistance for hours
*10:46.580- 10:49.160* :  until the full picture of what was happening became clearer
*10:49.680- 10:51.220* :  and more forces could be deployed.
*10:52.080- 10:55.720* :  It would take days to regain full control of the Gaza border.
*10:56.340- 10:58.220* :  Analysis there from Gordon Carrera.
*10:58.820- 11:00.300* :  Against the backdrop of the war,
*11:00.300- 11:02.420* :  the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
*11:02.420- 11:04.700* :  held talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu
*11:04.700- 11:07.340* :  to offer America's unwavering support for Israel.
*11:07.940- 11:09.360* :  At a news conference on Thursday
*11:09.360- 11:11.360* :  at the military headquarters in Tel Aviv,
*11:11.700- 11:14.120* :  Mr. Blinken stood alongside Benjamin Netanyahu
*11:14.280- 11:15.840* :  and spoke of their close ties.
*11:16.380- 11:19.080* :  People of Israel have long and rightly prided themselves
*11:19.380- 11:20.500* :  on their self-reliance,
*11:21.040- 11:23.180* :  on their ability to defend themselves,
*11:24.020- 11:25.760* :  even when the odds were stacked against them.
*11:26.040- 11:28.200* :  The message that I bring to Israel is this.
*11:28.780- 11:31.240* :  You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself,
*11:32.020- 11:33.700* :  but as long as America exists,
*11:34.360- 11:35.480* :  you will never ever have to.
*11:35.920- 11:38.460* :  We will always be there by your side.
*11:38.900- 11:41.300* :  For his part, Benjamin Netanyahu thanked America
*11:41.300- 11:42.300* :  for its support.
*11:43.020- 11:45.720* :  Thank you for your important visit here today.
*11:47.100- 11:47.520* :  Thank you.
*11:48.760- 11:49.740* :  Thank President Biden.
*11:51.260- 11:52.600* :  And thank you to the American people
*11:53.760- 11:55.900* :  for your incredible support for Israel.
*11:57.080- 12:00.600* :  In our war against the barbarians of Hamas.
*12:01.680- 12:05.300* :  As the past spoke, Mr. Blinken also delivered a personal appeal,
*12:05.760- 12:08.300* :  noting that his Jewish family had fled pogroms
*12:08.300- 12:09.900* :  in Europe and survived the Holocaust.
*12:10.580- 12:12.100* :  The United States, top diplomat,
*12:12.100- 12:14.040* :  is also hoping to contain the conflict.
*12:14.100- 12:17.180* :  As Israel continues its most intense bombing campaign,
*12:17.760- 12:19.300* :  promising to wipe out Hamas.
*12:19.680- 12:22.660* :  I heard more from our diplomatic correspondent, James Landel.
*12:23.140- 12:27.020* :  I think that what was striking about Mr. Blinken's response
*12:27.020- 12:30.800* :  to what he learnt here today was interesting
*12:30.860- 12:33.760* :  in just that he was clearly emotional about it.
*12:33.760- 12:35.880* :  It really touched him personally.
*12:35.880- 12:38.760* :  He spoke repeatedly about his own Jewish ancestry.
*12:38.820- 12:41.960* :  He spoke about how being overwhelmed by some of the images
*12:41.960- 12:43.940* :  that the Israeli government had shown him.
*12:44.500- 12:48.020* :  So I think that was a sort of personal human response
*12:48.100- 12:51.420* :  and demonstration of support that went alongside the diplomatic,
*12:51.420- 12:53.620* :  the geopolitical, the military support
*12:53.620- 12:55.220* :  that has been given at the same time.
*12:55.660- 13:00.100* :  But alongside that, again, came the cautionary note
*13:01.120- 13:04.460* :  when Mr. Blinken made it very clear to the Israelis
*13:04.460- 13:07.460* :  that for all that support, he still said, look,
*13:07.460- 13:09.340* :  Israel has a right to defend itself,
*13:09.340- 13:11.900* :  but how it does that matters.
*13:12.520- 13:16.280* :  He said, Israel had to take every possible precaution
*13:16.720- 13:19.200* :  to protect civilians from harm.
*13:19.940- 13:21.580* :  So for all the U.S. support,
*13:21.580- 13:23.820* :  there is still that cautionary note to say,
*13:24.380- 13:26.900* :  it's not a completely blank check.
*13:26.900- 13:28.700* :  It's not completely carte blanche.
*13:28.900- 13:30.540* :  It strikes me he could have voiced this support
*13:30.540- 13:33.620* :  from Washington, D.C., the British Foreign Minister, James Clevel,
*13:33.620- 13:36.000* :  who's also been in Israel, could have done similar from London.
*13:36.540- 13:39.320* :  There surely is symbolism by the very fact,
*13:39.320- 13:41.380* :  the very nature that they have gone to Israel
*13:41.380- 13:43.400* :  and made these comments on his really soil.
*13:43.700- 13:43.940* :  Absolutely.
*13:43.980- 13:46.400* :  And that's why other foreign ministers are following suit
*13:46.400- 13:48.600* :  and will be coming to visit Israel in coming days.
*13:49.100- 13:52.860* :  Sometimes, particularly in such a traumatic situation
*13:52.860- 13:55.600* :  as this, physical presence matters.
*13:55.860- 13:58.780* :  But equally, that will matter in coming days
*13:58.820- 14:01.240* :  when Mr. Blinken meets Arab leaders
*14:01.680- 14:02.920* :  throughout the Gulf and elsewhere,
*14:02.980- 14:05.940* :  just so that he can look them in the eye too and say, look,
*14:06.000- 14:08.780* :  we need to be concerned about the humanitarian situation
*14:08.780- 14:10.500* :  as he described it in Gaza.
*14:11.140- 14:12.880* :  We need to be concerned about the civilians
*14:12.880- 14:15.400* :  and he spoke about the need to talk about seeing
*14:15.400- 14:18.120* :  whether there's a possibility of opening up a corridor
*14:18.120- 14:21.960* :  of safe passage for civilians out of Gaza and things like that.
*14:22.220- 14:24.600* :  Mr. Blinken's been holding abrasive news conferences
*14:24.600- 14:25.340* :  in Tel Aviv.
*14:25.340- 14:27.940* :  He spoke about the hostages that are being held
*14:28.020- 14:29.220* :  by Hamas in Gaza.
*14:29.260- 14:30.820* :  Let's just take a listen to what he had to say.
*14:30.960- 14:32.560* :  We're doing everything we can to secure the release
*14:32.560- 14:35.480* :  of the hostages, working closely with our Israeli partners.
*14:35.760- 14:38.560* :  I brought with me to Israel our deputy special representative
*14:39.100- 14:40.580* :  for hostage affairs, Steve Gillen,
*14:41.020- 14:42.660* :  who joined my meetings with the families
*14:43.060- 14:45.380* :  and will stay on the ground here to support the efforts
*14:45.920- 14:46.780* :  to free their loved ones.
*14:47.160- 14:53.740* :  How does the US manage to leverage its strength in the region?
*14:53.840- 14:56.040* :  How does it manage to leverage its contacts,
*14:56.040- 14:57.980* :  like you say, with other Middle Eastern countries
*14:57.980- 15:00.780* :  to try and resolve things like the hostage situation?
*15:01.040- 15:04.360* :  The US can bring intelligence, it can bring expertise,
*15:05.120- 15:07.860* :  but ultimately it's the Israelis that will be in charge of this.
*15:08.180- 15:11.860* :  And it'll be the Israelis who have to make the brutal calculation
*15:12.400- 15:16.920* :  of how hard do they wish to destroy Hamas as a military machine?
*15:17.740- 15:20.720* :  And how much do they wish to save the hostages?
*15:20.720- 15:23.880* :  Because it is possible that those two imperatives
*15:24.620- 15:26.200* :  are attention sometime.
*15:27.080- 15:28.320* :  One Israeli commentator said,
*15:28.320- 15:30.340* :  almost for Hamas, they've almost got too many.
*15:30.800- 15:33.300* :  Logistically, it's hard to keep 150 people,
*15:33.300- 15:34.360* :  which is the number we're talking.
*15:34.980- 15:37.840* :  So there's talk possibly maybe of women and children
*15:37.840- 15:39.820* :  being exchanged at some point,
*15:40.180- 15:42.720* :  maybe making a distinction between soldiers and civilians
*15:42.720- 15:43.700* :  and things like that.
*15:44.120- 15:45.880* :  But this is very, very early days.
*15:46.820- 15:47.900* :  It'll be complicated.
*15:47.900- 15:50.840* :  The hostages will be spread all over
*15:51.260- 15:53.080* :  in different locations throughout Gaza.
*15:53.520- 15:55.400* :  And they are in a very perilous situation.
*15:56.020- 15:57.400* :  The voice there of James Lander,
*15:57.440- 15:59.140* :  well, the White House has now confirmed
*15:59.140- 16:02.840* :  that 27 US citizens were killed in the Hamas attacks
*16:03.360- 16:05.460* :  and that 14 remain unaccounted for.
*16:05.860- 16:08.020* :  And we heard just there about the sensitive nature
*16:08.020- 16:09.500* :  of hostage negotiations.
*16:09.500- 16:11.880* :  So how do you get people out alive?
*16:12.640- 16:14.940* :  Well, the Israeli defense forces or IDF believe
*16:14.940- 16:17.600* :  that 150 hostages have been dispersed
*16:17.600- 16:20.220* :  throughout tunnels under Gaza in locations
*16:20.220- 16:23.540* :  that were not known to be used by Hamas prior to this conflict.
*16:24.220- 16:24.760* :  For more on this,
*16:24.760- 16:27.420* :  the BBC's Christian Fraser spoke to Scott Walker,
*16:27.420- 16:29.240* :  a former hostage negotiator
*16:29.620- 16:32.740* :  who's resolved more than 300 cases in his career.
*16:33.200- 16:35.820* :  How does he view the current hostage situation in Gaza?
*16:36.440- 16:38.780* :  Well, as you can imagine in the early hours and days,
*16:38.780- 16:42.460* :  there's lots of high-motion uncertainty and confusion.
*16:43.180- 16:45.740* :  So one of the early stages is try and build
*16:45.740- 16:47.560* :  and information intelligence picture,
*16:48.140- 16:49.560* :  try and find out what is going on,
*16:49.920- 16:51.560* :  who actually has the hostages
*16:52.280- 16:54.860* :  and try and engage in some kind of dialogue with them.
*16:55.020- 16:57.300* :  It's different, though, when you're dealing with an organization
*16:57.720- 16:59.220* :  rather than a state or a government
*16:59.980- 17:03.020* :  and the demands of Hamas are so much different
*17:03.020- 17:05.620* :  to what other groups would be looking for, correct?
*17:05.760- 17:07.560* :  Well, this is the challenge in this particular case
*17:07.580- 17:10.520* :  because the negotiations when they take place
*17:10.560- 17:12.440* :  are actually occurring in a war zone.
*17:12.680- 17:14.600* :  There's an extra dimension to it as well,
*17:14.680- 17:17.660* :  and there are so many of them spread out across Gaza
*17:17.660- 17:19.300* :  as well as you mentioned early in tunnels
*17:19.480- 17:21.260* :  and basements and what have you.
*17:21.600- 17:24.760* :  It seems to me that the strategy has to be keeping
*17:24.760- 17:26.780* :  in the mind of the hostage takers,
*17:26.780- 17:28.560* :  the value of the people they're holding.
*17:28.760- 17:29.740* :  How do you do that?
*17:29.920- 17:31.680* :  Absolutely, it's about humanizing them
*17:31.960- 17:34.060* :  and it's just a kind of reiterate right at the beginning
*17:34.060- 17:35.840* :  when we talk about negotiation,
*17:36.420- 17:38.860* :  we're not talking about agreeing or condoning
*17:38.860- 17:41.880* :  or acquiescing to the hostage takers.
*17:42.240- 17:44.500* :  It's actually just opening up some kind of dialogue
*17:45.000- 17:47.240* :  to enable the safe and timely release.
*17:47.780- 17:49.600* :  So in the case of Hamas,
*17:49.600- 17:51.880* :  that would be we could talk about prisoners,
*17:52.400- 17:54.480* :  but what, you have to give us some proof of life,
*17:54.480- 17:55.880* :  you have to give us some proof
*17:55.880- 17:57.180* :  that they're being well cared for.
*17:57.440- 18:00.220* :  Absolutely, proof of life is one of the fundamental aspects
*18:00.240- 18:01.520* :  of all hostage negotiation,
*18:02.160- 18:03.660* :  and it's been normally done in the very early stages.
*18:03.880- 18:06.540* :  What about the complexity of this bit?
*18:06.700- 18:07.560* :  Because as I've just described,
*18:07.580- 18:09.660* :  I mean, I don't know how many hostages
*18:09.680- 18:11.000* :  are in there of different nationalities,
*18:11.000- 18:13.840* :  but we've pulled out four, the French, the Brits,
*18:13.840- 18:15.880* :  the Americans, of course, the Israelis.
*18:16.580- 18:17.520* :  Who takes the lead?
*18:17.520- 18:19.560* :  Because what you don't want to do
*18:19.560- 18:21.660* :  is over complicate a situation like this.
*18:21.760- 18:24.940* :  Well, my understanding is there is a coordination cell
*18:24.940- 18:26.740* :  and situation room set up,
*18:26.760- 18:29.720* :  and that will bring together the Americans through the FBI
*18:29.720- 18:31.580* :  and the Brits and other nationalities
*18:31.580- 18:34.140* :  that you have hostages taken out there as well,
*18:34.180- 18:35.600* :  to kind of coordinate the response,
*18:36.240- 18:39.340* :  to try and identify and locate where the hostages are being held,
*18:39.680- 18:40.980* :  and actually, one of the options are,
*18:41.160- 18:43.840* :  including there will be options for hostage rescue,
*18:43.840- 18:46.720* :  perhaps, as part of the the incursion that is inevitable,
*18:46.720- 18:49.880* :  but obviously only increases the risk to the hostages.
*18:49.880- 18:53.140* :  That was the former hostage negotiator, Scott Walker.
*18:56.280- 18:56.860* :  Still to come?
*18:57.220- 18:59.940* :  Finally, the Australian Constitution

*19:09.980- 19:12.160* :  should be recognized in the Constitution.

*20:15.820- 20:18.300* :  For now, though, welcome back to the Global News Podcast,
*20:18.300- 20:21.300* :  the war in Ukraine has once again had an impact
*20:21.300- 20:22.620* :  on the world of sport.
*20:23.140- 20:25.220* :  That's because the Russian Olympic Committee
*20:25.220- 20:28.220* :  has been suspended by the International Olympic Committee,
*20:28.220- 20:31.480* :  the IOC, for breaching the Olympic Charter.
*20:31.920- 20:34.420* :  Last week, Russia incorporated sports bodies
*20:34.420- 20:36.560* :  in full regions in eastern Ukraine
*20:36.560- 20:38.700* :  that have been illegally annexed by Moscow
*20:39.280- 20:41.020* :  since its full-scale invasion began.
*20:41.560- 20:44.120* :  But the decision might still come as a surprise to some
*20:44.400- 20:46.680* :  as our sports reporter Alex Kapstik explains.
*20:47.380- 20:49.180* :  Well, a lot of people, I think it's fair to say,
*20:49.180- 20:51.960* :  might think that the Russian Olympic Committee
*20:51.960- 20:54.220* :  has already been suspended because of the invasion
*20:54.280- 20:55.780* :  of Ukraine, but that's not the case.
*20:55.780- 20:57.400* :  In fact, the previous sanctions,
*20:58.260- 21:01.540* :  they are aimed at the Russian government for the invasion,
*21:01.840- 21:03.700* :  not officials and the International Olympic Committee
*21:03.700- 21:06.380* :  have always made a point of stressing that.
*21:06.860- 21:10.240* :  What's happened here is that the Russian Olympic Committee
*21:10.860- 21:15.020* :  announced last week that it had formally recognized
*21:15.480- 21:19.000* :  four regional organizations from territories annexed
*21:19.580- 21:20.320* :  from Ukraine.
*21:20.320- 21:22.460* :  So basically they've absorbed the Olympic Councils
*21:22.460- 21:25.800* :  of the Hanks, Don Yeks, Kieson and Zaparitia.
*21:26.220- 21:28.100* :  And that is against the rules.
*21:28.280- 21:31.420* :  It breaches the Olympic Charter, the Olympic Truth,
*21:31.420- 21:34.240* :  what they're saying is that the Russians have violated
*21:34.240- 21:37.980* :  the territorial integrity of the Ukraine Olympic Committee.
*21:37.980- 21:39.660* :  So that is why they have now gone
*21:40.220- 21:41.840* :  and made this announcement to suspend
*21:42.480- 21:44.460* :  the Russian Olympic Committee.
*21:44.880- 21:47.960* :  It doesn't affect what is already in place concerning
*21:48.540- 21:50.580* :  the participation of Russian athletes.
*21:50.720- 21:51.900* :  You may remember that earlier this year,
*21:52.580- 21:54.220* :  Thomas Bakery, ISU President said
*21:54.220- 21:56.000* :  that they should be allowed to compete.
*21:56.000- 21:58.220* :  In fact, he recommended that federations allow
*21:58.780- 22:00.160* :  Russians to compete and better Russians
*22:00.600- 22:03.420* :  as neutral athletes and district conditions
*22:03.420- 22:06.580* :  as individual they can't turn up as teams.
*22:07.260- 22:09.480* :  Although as yet, they've not made a decision
*22:09.500- 22:11.760* :  on whether Russians and better Russians
*22:11.760- 22:13.940* :  can compete next year's Paris Olympics.
*22:14.360- 22:16.700* :  And Alex, what has the reaction been to this announcement today?
*22:16.960- 22:18.300* :  Well, the Russians have dismissed it.
*22:18.300- 22:20.120* :  They say it's a political decision,
*22:20.120- 22:21.860* :  as you would expect it's how they respond
*22:21.860- 22:24.920* :  to most of these decisions that go against them.
*22:24.920- 22:27.240* :  The Ukrainians, well, they will welcome it.
*22:27.240- 22:30.400* :  They'll welcome this decisive action from the IAC.
*22:30.400- 22:31.980* :  What it means for those Olympic councils
*22:31.980- 22:35.740* :  and those regions that I mentioned in Eastern Ukraine
*22:35.740- 22:36.800* :  will have to wait and see.
*22:36.800- 22:38.300* :  But the Russians, as far as they're concerned,
*22:38.300- 22:41.320* :  they are part of the Russian Olympic Committee.
*22:41.840- 22:42.720* :  Alex Campstik.
*22:43.360- 22:45.240* :  The South African authorities say
*22:45.240- 22:47.800* :  they have uncovered a cold smuggling syndicate
*22:47.800- 22:50.920* :  that's played a major role in the country's energy crisis.
*22:51.540- 22:53.600* :  The suspects include former employees
*22:53.600- 22:56.280* :  of Eskon, the state-owned electricity firm.
*22:56.800- 22:59.200* :  It's widely believed that high levels of corruption
*22:59.200- 23:01.720* :  long prevented any action from being taken.
*23:02.160- 23:03.060* :  Ed Habeson reports.
*23:04.140- 23:07.000* :  South Africa has suffered rolling blackouts for years now.
*23:07.300- 23:08.840* :  And authorities say criminal gangs
*23:08.840- 23:11.480* :  play a major role in the country's energy crisis.
*23:12.320- 23:14.580* :  They say the cartels still high-grade coal
*23:14.920- 23:17.580* :  and swap it for low-grade coal at so-called black sites
*23:18.100- 23:19.240* :  then sell the coal on.
*23:19.880- 23:22.920* :  The low-grade coal is then used in the country's power stations,
*23:23.380- 23:24.840* :  which can lead them to break down.
*23:25.620- 23:27.380* :  Now a group of government organizations
*23:27.500- 23:30.140* :  led by the National Tax Body, known as SARS,
*23:30.680- 23:32.500* :  has launched a joint-sting operation
*23:32.500- 23:34.460* :  to try put a stock to the gangs
*23:34.460- 23:37.000* :  and recoup millions in tax money.
*23:37.320- 23:39.220* :  It's worth noting that the issue of coal theft
*23:39.220- 23:42.640* :  has been reported in South Africa's media for several years.
*23:43.740- 23:45.820* :  Australians go to the polls on Saturday
*23:45.820- 23:47.780* :  in a historic referendum,
*23:48.320- 23:50.620* :  a vote on what is called the indigenous voice,
*23:50.780- 23:52.880* :  a proposal to change the constitution
*23:53.000- 23:56.120* :  to recognize Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
*23:56.520- 23:58.280* :  and create a body that can advise government
*23:58.280- 24:00.220* :  on issues that affect their communities.
*24:00.860- 24:04.200* :  The referendum was proposed as a way to try and unite the country,
*24:04.200- 24:06.840* :  but it's produced a campaign that's bitterly divided people
*24:07.400- 24:09.160* :  so which way will Australians vote?
*24:09.720- 24:11.480* :  Katie Watson begins her report
*24:11.480- 24:14.040* :  from the town of the Aboriginal community of Yarraba
*24:14.080- 24:15.520* :  in the far north of Queensland.
*24:19.980- 24:21.580* :  There's a music festival going on
*24:21.580- 24:23.480* :  in the Aboriginal town of Yarraba.
*24:23.900- 24:26.900* :  It's a celebration of the world's oldest living culture.
*24:31.700- 24:35.180* :  This is a country often touted as a multicultural success story,
*24:35.580- 24:38.280* :  but Australia is going through a historical reckoning,
*24:38.760- 24:41.160* :  reflecting on its violent colonial past
*24:41.740- 24:43.540* :  and looking towards a new future.
*24:44.420- 24:46.060* :  It means that finally,
*24:46.760- 24:48.460* :  the Australian constitution
*24:49.400- 24:54.080* :  will recognize that we were here for 65,000 years.
*24:54.080- 24:56.320* :  Australia's Indigenous Minister, Linda Bernie,
*24:56.840- 24:59.840* :  was on stage at Yarraba to urge people to vote yes
*24:59.840- 25:00.860* :  in this referendum.
*25:01.460- 25:05.320* :  The government proposal was to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
*25:05.380- 25:08.140* :  people a voice on issues that affect them most,
*25:08.700- 25:11.900* :  trying to narrow the inequalities on issues such as education,
*25:12.420- 25:13.620* :  poverty and health.
*25:16.060- 25:18.080* :  Not far away, we meet Suzanne Andrews
*25:18.180- 25:20.440* :  at one of the health centres she runs in Yarraba.
*25:20.900- 25:24.660* :  She knows all too well the poor health outcomes in communities like hers.
*25:25.080- 25:29.200* :  When we're looking at or making decisions around health or health policies,
*25:30.040- 25:33.920* :  we need to be making those decisions from us people on the ground here in communities,
*25:34.520- 25:36.840* :  not in the doors of Parliament and camera.
*25:37.460- 25:40.120* :  My late parents would be wondering what I'm doing
*25:40.120- 25:43.700* :  on a Sunday morning, not being in church.
*25:45.140- 25:47.300* :  For fellow Indigenous Queenslander Noel Pearson,
*25:47.840- 25:51.220* :  one of the leaders who's pushed for this referendum, it's bigger than that.
*25:51.640- 25:56.520* :  The legacy we're trying to sort out here is a British legacy.
*25:57.700- 26:03.020* :  It is the bloody and miserable legacy of colonisation.
*26:03.480- 26:04.480* :  We have a chance here.
*26:04.640- 26:08.400* :  It's a once in a nation's lifetime opportunity to get it right.
*26:09.160- 26:11.360* :  Yes, yes, yes!
*26:11.820- 26:15.960* :  Polling suggests majority of Indigenous Australians want this proposal to pass,
*26:15.980- 26:22.020* :  but Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders make up little more than 3% of Australia's population.
*26:22.760- 26:26.960* :  Ironically, the people deciding this vote and the fate of Indigenous communities
*26:27.560- 26:29.060* :  will be outsiders once again.
*26:30.600- 26:31.680* :  It's been a bitter campaign.
*26:31.800- 26:34.900* :  Conservative voters feel the proposal's divisive.
*26:35.500- 26:37.740* :  Frank Titans going to vote no on Saturday.
*26:38.260- 26:40.020* :  We're not the racist people here.
*26:40.680- 26:43.640* :  If you want to have a good functioning country, you can't have divisions.
*26:44.440- 26:46.220* :  You can't have separations.
*26:47.340- 26:48.020* :  Why are we now?
*26:48.780- 26:52.380* :  The proposals also expose divisions within Indigenous communities,
*26:52.700- 26:55.220* :  traumatising people and heightening discrimination.
*26:56.100- 27:00.800* :  The voice is about assimilating us into the colonial constitution
*27:01.020- 27:04.620* :  to make us nice and neat little Indigenous Australians
*27:04.620- 27:08.040* :  that will continue to be oppressed by the coloniser.
*27:08.560- 27:11.260* :  Lydia Thorpe is an independent senator in Victoria,
*27:11.660- 27:14.120* :  the first Aboriginal senator for that state.
*27:14.280- 27:17.220* :  The amount of money that is going on this referendum
*27:17.880- 27:23.860* :  while our people are hungry and homeless and suicide rates through the roof
*27:24.540- 27:27.500* :  just shows you how wrong this country is
*27:28.140- 27:31.820* :  and how they think that they can fix the Aboriginal problem.
*27:36.500- 27:40.260* :  Back at the first of all, most people here clearly want this reformed pass.
*27:40.920- 27:42.800* :  But as Australia heads towards the weekend,
*27:43.240- 27:45.080* :  it's looking like the NOVO will win.
*27:45.700- 27:47.440* :  With that, we'll come much reflection
*27:47.960- 27:50.400* :  about how this country values all of its people.
*27:51.980- 27:54.140* :  Katie Watson, they're reporting from Australia.
*27:55.220- 27:57.520* :  The former head of Formula One motor racing,
*27:57.520- 28:00.840* :  Bernie Echelston, has received a suspended prison sentence
*28:00.840- 28:02.280* :  after admitting fraud.
*28:02.920- 28:05.800* :  Back in 2015, he lied to tax inspectors
*28:05.800- 28:08.820* :  failing to tell them about hundreds of millions of dollars
*28:08.820- 28:09.800* :  that he held abroad.
*28:10.520- 28:13.540* :  An investigation was then conducted by the UK Tax Agency,
*28:13.540- 28:17.060* :  HMRC, and the Crown Prosecution Service, or CPS.
*28:17.760- 28:19.340* :  The judge of the court in London said
*28:19.340- 28:21.940* :  Bernie Echelston was motivated by personal gain.
*28:22.360- 28:23.760* :  Simon Jones was at the hearing.
*28:24.400- 28:27.420* :  For decades, Bernie Echelston was the face of Formula One
*28:27.420- 28:29.700* :  credited with revitalising the sport.
*28:29.700- 28:31.760* :  Today, though, the billionaire businessman
*28:31.760- 28:33.780* :  faced a much more humbling experience
*28:33.780- 28:35.800* :  in the dock at Southern Crown Court.
*28:36.400- 28:38.900* :  In 2015, he failed to tell tax inspectors
*28:38.900- 28:40.400* :  examining his financial affairs
*28:40.780- 28:42.340* :  that he'd set up a trust in Singapore
*28:42.340- 28:45.140* :  with assets of more than 400 million pounds.
*28:45.720- 28:48.760* :  He'd lied because he'd wanted to bring a swift end to the investigation
*28:49.180- 28:51.320* :  and avoid paying large fees to his lawyers.
*28:51.800- 28:53.840* :  The court heard he may not have been entirely clear
*28:53.840- 28:55.040* :  how the fund was structured,
*28:55.040- 28:57.940* :  but his desire to save money has cost him dear.
*28:58.520- 29:01.960* :  He received a 17-month jail sentence suspended for two years.
*29:02.340- 29:04.020* :  The judge took into account his age,
*29:04.020- 29:06.580* :  Echelston will turn 93 later this month,
*29:06.920- 29:07.920* :  and his frail health.
*29:08.400- 29:11.340* :  Achieve Crown Prosecutor from the CPS Andrew Penn Hale
*29:11.520- 29:13.700* :  said the conviction sent out a clear message.
*29:14.200- 29:15.760* :  All members of UK society,
*29:16.320- 29:18.660* :  regardless of how wealthy and famous they are,
*29:19.060- 29:21.840* :  must pay their taxes and be transparent and open
*29:21.840- 29:23.980* :  with HMRC about their financial affairs.
*29:24.680- 29:27.260* :  The CPS are pleased to bring such a complex case
*29:27.760- 29:28.960* :  to a successful conclusion.
*29:29.620- 29:31.720* :  We worked very closely with HMRC throughout,
*29:32.420- 29:34.960* :  and it is rewarding to see that they have also secured
*29:35.380- 29:37.260* :  such a significant civil tax settlement.
*29:37.780- 29:39.380* :  That settlement will involve Echelston
*29:39.380- 29:42.560* :  paying 650 million pounds to cover his tax affairs
*29:42.920- 29:44.740* :  relating to an 18-year period.
*29:45.180- 29:46.520* :  He left court without commenting,
*29:46.940- 29:48.300* :  but with a conviction for fraud,
*29:48.300- 29:50.520* :  following what was described as a lengthy
*29:50.520- 29:52.340* :  and worldwide investigation.
*29:52.800- 29:53.960* :  That was Simon James.
*29:54.040- 29:56.300* :  Well, let's stick with the theme of money
*29:56.300- 29:59.780* :  because someone has just become very, very rich indeed.
*30:00.360- 30:01.060* :  We don't know who.
*30:01.600- 30:04.280* :  Southern California has a new billionaire tonight.
*30:04.280- 30:06.760* :  That's right, the one and only winning ticket
*30:06.760- 30:10.260* :  in tonight's $1.7 billion power ball lottery
*30:10.760- 30:13.380* :  was sold right here in Southern California.
*30:13.820- 30:17.420* :  $1.7 billion, lottery officials know
*30:17.420- 30:19.860* :  that the winning ticket was bought at the midway market
*30:19.860- 30:21.340* :  and liquor store in Frazier Park.
*30:21.340- 30:24.520* :  That's about 100 or so kilometers outside Los Angeles,
*30:24.520- 30:27.920* :  but so far, nobody has claimed that mega price.
*30:28.540- 30:30.860* :  Well, the BBC's Sam Fenik spoke to these shop workers,
*30:30.860- 30:33.440* :  Janay Herrera, and asked of what her reaction was
*30:33.440- 30:35.660* :  that the winning ticket came from her store.
*30:36.280- 30:37.700* :  Pretty crazy for me.
*30:37.900- 30:39.520* :  I mean, we don't know who's bought it,
*30:39.540- 30:43.240* :  but do you guys have a kind of idea locally who's bought it?
*30:43.560- 30:44.800* :  I have no idea.
*30:44.800- 30:47.180* :  I'm completely, like, unsure.
*30:47.400- 30:50.860* :  And I'm really hoping that somebody that is involved
*30:50.860- 30:51.740* :  in the community.
*30:52.040- 30:54.300* :  A lottery ticket's popular with the store.
*30:54.300- 30:55.660* :  Do lots of people buy them?
*30:55.820- 30:58.200* :  Yes, almost every day.
*30:58.440- 30:59.100* :  Almost every day.
*30:59.100- 31:00.540* :  How many do you think you sell them?
*31:00.740- 31:01.180* :  A lot.
*31:02.680- 31:02.980* :  A lot.
*31:02.980- 31:04.940* :  Yeah, well, we have people who come in here doing it
*31:04.940- 31:06.920* :  Monday, Wednesday, Saturday.
*31:07.460- 31:09.740* :  What's the feeling with people that have been in the shop?
*31:09.740- 31:11.060* :  I know it's very early with you,
*31:11.080- 31:13.120* :  but what's the feeling around the community?
*31:13.160- 31:15.000* :  Are people kind of excited about it?
*31:15.080- 31:16.940* :  But everybody's hoping they know who won.
*31:18.560- 31:20.060* :  Well, I heard one of your colleagues
*31:20.060- 31:21.520* :  who also works in the store.
*31:21.520- 31:24.260* :  So he wants the winner to buy him a truck.
*31:24.760- 31:26.460* :  Do you have a shopping list of things
*31:26.460- 31:27.860* :  that you quite fancy?
*31:28.260- 31:29.700* :  No, but I'll take a truck.
*31:30.260- 31:31.240* :  You take a truck.
*31:31.740- 31:32.680* :  Well, they may be lucky.
*31:32.680- 31:35.740* :  They may be actually receiving a million dollars.
*31:35.740- 31:38.460* :  It's thought that the shop will receive a million dollar reward
*31:38.460- 31:40.000* :  for selling that lucky ticket.
*31:43.100- 31:44.160* :  Well, that's all from us for now.
*31:44.160- 31:46.820* :  But there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast
*31:46.820- 31:48.020* :  a little later on.
*31:48.020- 31:49.840* :  If you want to come into this one or any of the topics,
*31:49.840- 31:50.540* :  drop us an email.
*31:50.540- 31:53.800* :  The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*31:54.440- 31:57.100* :  You can also find us on X at Global News Pod.
