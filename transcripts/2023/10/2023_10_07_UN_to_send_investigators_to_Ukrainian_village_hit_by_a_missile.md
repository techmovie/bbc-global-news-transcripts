*01:46.020- 01:50.560* :  I'm Janet Jalille and in the early hours of Saturday 7th of October, these are our main
*01:50.560- 01:55.800* :  stories. You and investigators are heading to a Ukrainian village where more than 50 people
*01:55.840- 01:59.400* :  were killed in an air strike to determine if it was a war crime.
*02:00.180- 02:06.040* :  Job's growth in the United States exceeds expectation, increasing the chance that interest rates
*02:06.040- 02:12.540* :  fall rise. Israeli soldiers clash with Palestinian mourners at the funeral of a young man who
*02:12.540- 02:25.260* :  was shot dead in the occupied West Bank. Also in this podcast, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, we have ignition
*02:26.300- 02:32.080* :  and lift off of the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket carrying the proto-flight mission
*02:32.080- 02:38.500* :  for Amazon's project Kuiper. Amazon launches two satellites into orbit as part of its plans
*02:38.500- 02:41.080* :  to provide internet coverage from space.
*02:45.440- 02:49.960* :  We begin in Ukraine. The UN is sending investigators to the village of Rosa
*02:49.960- 02:55.480* :  in Northeastern Ukraine to determine whether a missile strike that killed more than 50 people
*02:55.480- 03:01.740* :  on Thursday constitutes a war crime. Those killed in the missile strike were attending a funeral
*03:01.740- 03:07.260* :  wake for a local soldier who was being reburied. And there have been suggestions that Russia
*03:07.260- 03:13.580* :  deliberately targeted the memorial, a charge it denies. One resident, Valerie Kozeer,
*03:13.580- 03:19.000* :  said he'd lost many friends and relatives, including his daughter and son-in-law.
*03:21.300- 03:27.220* :  I wish I were dead. All my dearest people were delayed here. Our village was very united.
*03:27.780- 03:33.840* :  I had 17 close friends. I have grandchildren. And what am I going to do now? Close friends,
*03:33.840- 03:40.620* :  cousins, or were killed. My dearest people will be put to rest here. My daughter, son-in-law,
*03:40.620- 03:45.820* :  and his father. Tetyana also lost family members in the attack.
*03:48.100- 03:54.060* :  My daughter, my son-in-law, and his mother. They found my son-in-law, but not my daughter,
*03:54.060- 04:01.060* :  or my son-in-law's mother. We heard explosions and came here. My grandson came and said that
*04:01.060- 04:06.960* :  there's nobody alive here. Liz Throssel is a spokeswoman for the UN Commissioner for Human Rights.
*04:07.400- 04:12.060* :  She said the initial indications were that Russia had carried out the attack, even though there
*04:12.060- 04:18.300* :  were no military targets nearby. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Falkertuk, who saw for himself
*04:18.300- 04:24.180* :  the horrific impact of such strikes, is profoundly shocked and condemns these killings.
*04:24.760- 04:29.620* :  He's deployed a field team to the site to speak to survivors and gather more information.
*04:30.360- 04:34.380* :  The Kremlin says it doesn't target civilians. A day after the attack,
*04:34.380- 04:38.100* :  are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse managed to reach the village?
*04:39.320- 04:50.060* :  It's taken us seven hours to get to Odajar and in somewhere so sparse, you instantly notice
*04:51.600- 04:59.040* :  the gathering of vehicles on an usual amount. There's a United Nations truck which is
*04:59.720- 05:09.800* :  rocked up, giving people food. There are counsellors on site, and then you get that smell, that smell of
*05:09.800- 05:20.360* :  burning. Such as the directness, if you like, of this strike, the sheer force caused by this missile,
*05:21.080- 05:25.120* :  it's not immediately obvious what was once here. There's definitely been some
*05:26.260- 05:33.760* :  debris clearance. You can see twisted metal and air conditioning unit. There's a range over here
*05:33.760- 05:42.080* :  with its windows completely blasted through. There's a Mercedes with the roof completely caved in,
*05:42.420- 05:51.280* :  and there is the frame of two rooms, this presumably is where the cafe was, you can see wallpaper,
*05:52.440- 05:58.780* :  different types of wallpaper next to each other, where the walls have been blown away, and to my right
*05:58.780- 06:09.500* :  is the playground where most of the bodies were recovered, nearly the swings and the slide are
*06:10.260- 06:14.960* :  still standing, there's a makeshift, but more real people have been leaving candles,
*06:16.100- 06:20.380* :  there are blood stains on the grass, used body bags.
*06:25.740- 06:32.140* :  Ukraine labels this as a very deliberate attack, the use of a ballistic missile suggests that,
*06:32.960- 06:41.760* :  but in a village like Rosar, it couldn't feel more indiscriminate, it's a strange juxtaposition,
*06:41.840- 06:49.940* :  this is a tiny, tiny settlement in the middle of the rural heartkiv region. This is an especially
*06:51.240- 06:56.580* :  jarring site in a settlement this small, it's a picture of finality, people here they were
*06:56.580- 07:04.420* :  gathering to celebrate someone's life, today it is this deep wound you've got, what's left
*07:05.640- 07:12.160* :  of the cafe the pharmacy next door has been completely blown through, and what locals are saying
*07:12.160- 07:16.860* :  is that Rosar is usually spared the shelling other villages have to go through.
*07:18.460- 07:20.900* :  James Waterhouse in Northeastern Ukraine
*07:22.020- 07:28.500* :  It sounds like good news, the US saw a huge rise in new jobs last month, more than 300,000
*07:28.500- 07:34.760* :  far more than expected, so why did markets initially treat this as bad news before recovering?
*07:35.800- 07:40.500* :  My colleague Rahul Tandon heard more about the unexpected jobs figures from our North America
*07:40.500- 07:46.880* :  business correspondent, Michelle Flurry. I think everyone's breath was taken away by these numbers,
*07:46.880- 07:53.340* :  it was double what economists were forecasting, which was closer to 170,000 jobs, but instead
*07:53.340- 08:01.620* :  American employers added 336,000 employees in September. Some of that was in the government sector,
*08:01.620- 08:06.420* :  some of it was leisure and hospitality, you know there isn't assumption that this is partly
*08:06.420- 08:11.760* :  a reflection of seasonal factors, the fact that you head back to school that kind of can often
*08:11.760- 08:16.220* :  create more jobs, whether it's people in the department of education, whether that's more
*08:16.220- 08:22.160* :  childcare that's needed, there is a sense that this is a US labour market that is still performing
*08:22.160- 08:28.020* :  very strong, that companies are clearly sort of not too concerned or at least setting aside
*08:28.020- 08:32.540* :  concerns about high interest rate and about concerns about the outlook for the US economy.
*08:32.760- 08:36.620* :  And that is really important, isn't it? Because Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve,
*08:36.620- 08:42.200* :  will be sitting there looking at these figures and maybe now thinking, do I have to raise interest
*08:42.200- 08:46.760* :  rates even more because the economy doesn't seem to be cooling down as people thought it might?
*08:46.900- 08:50.860* :  Well, I mean this is a Federal Reserve that has said it's data dependent and if you look at this
*08:50.860- 08:55.760* :  piece of data, the conclusion you come to, at least that is the conclusion many investors, many
*08:55.760- 09:00.320* :  on Wall Street to draw, is that there is going to be another rate increase possibly as soon as it's
*09:00.320- 09:05.740* :  meeting next month and that the Federal Reserve has already indicated it intended to keep
*09:05.740- 09:10.280* :  interest rates high for much longer than people had previously thought, now it looks like there
*09:10.280- 09:16.800* :  may even be a rate hike on the taps. Michel Flurry, the number of people killed by a drone attack
*09:16.800- 09:23.480* :  on a military academy in Syria on Thursday has risen to 89. Funerals have been held for the victims,
*09:23.480- 09:28.620* :  many of whom were women and children who'd come to watch a graduation ceremony at the academy
*09:28.620- 09:34.940* :  in the city of Homs. Several drones loaded with explosives targeted the families shortly after
*09:34.940- 09:41.380* :  the event had ended, but it wasn't immediately clear who'd carried out the attack. With his analysis,
*09:41.380- 09:46.300* :  here's our security correspondent, Frank Gardner. The drones were believed to be a
*09:46.300- 09:51.160* :  Iranian-made long-distance weapons fired from the northwest of the country. The Syrian government
*09:51.160- 09:56.700* :  has blamed what it calls terrorist groups operating there, an ongoing legacy of Syria's 12-year-long
*09:56.700- 10:02.440* :  civil war. Chief amongst the rebel groups is the al-Qaeda-inspired Hayat-Tahrir-Asham,
*10:02.440- 10:07.560* :  meaning the organization for the liberation of greater Syria. The government in Damascus has
*10:07.560- 10:12.560* :  fired retaliation, and its forces have struck a number of rebel-held areas. Islamist opposition
*10:12.560- 10:17.820* :  groups fighting Syrian government forces have celebrated the drone strikes on Homs, but not said
*10:17.820- 10:22.580* :  they were involved. Many of their members are accusing the Syrian regime of carrying out a
*10:22.580- 10:28.260* :  so-called false flag attack on its own people, to use as a pretext for further attacks on both
*10:28.260- 10:33.440* :  rebels and civilians living in areas beyond government control. They point out that Syria's
*10:33.440- 10:38.600* :  defense minister attended the ceremony, but left just before the drone struck the parade ground.
*10:39.540- 10:45.360* :  Frank Gardner, Palestinian health officials say more than 50 people have been injured in clashes
*10:45.360- 10:51.300* :  with Israeli forces at a funeral in the occupied West Bank. More than the town of Hawara had gathered
*10:51.300- 10:57.100* :  for the funeral of a 19-year-old Palestinian. He was shot dead during an attack by a group of
*10:57.100- 11:03.420* :  Jewish settlers who damaged Homs, shops, and cars. Here's our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell.
*11:04.320- 11:09.840* :  Protests followed the funeral of the 19-year-old university student with Palestinian setting tires on
*11:09.840- 11:14.840* :  fire and throwing stones at Israeli soldiers. Palestinian medics say most of those they treated
*11:14.840- 11:20.160* :  have been overcome by tear gas used by Israeli forces with three shots by live gunfire.
*11:20.660- 11:25.820* :  Social media videos show that a group of settlers erected a tent in Hawara overnight and held
*11:25.820- 11:31.360* :  prayers. Shops and cars were vandalized. The Israeli military said that Israelis and Palestinians
*11:31.360- 11:36.520* :  had thrown stones at each other. Residents said that a settler shot the Palestinian student dead
*11:36.520- 11:40.880* :  while he was watching events from the roof of his home. The Israeli military offered a different
*11:40.880- 11:46.080* :  account, saying its forces opened fire at a Palestinian who threw a brick at soldiers without
*11:46.080- 11:51.420* :  giving the identity. Tensions now remain high in Hawara, which has been a frequent flashpoint
*11:51.420- 11:56.240* :  for violence in the West Bank over the past year, with shootings of Israelis passing through
*11:56.240- 12:04.420* :  the town and settler revenge attacks. Yolanda Nell. Next to Romania, 10 years ago, protests by
*12:04.420- 12:08.840* :  environmentalists stopped a huge gold mining project in the mountains of Transylvania.
*12:09.540- 12:14.900* :  The area has since been declared a UNESCO protected site and the Canadian company which wanted
*12:14.900- 12:20.320* :  to build the mine is suing the Romanian state for four billion dollars in damages.
*12:21.120- 12:25.520* :  Our central Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe went back to the town of Rosia Montana to find
*12:25.520- 12:36.620* :  out how it's fairing without the mine. The Fan Fest Music and Theatre Festival from the
*12:36.620- 12:41.140* :  heyday of the campaign to save Rosia Montana in the summer of 2012.
*12:44.760- 12:50.540* :  The festival was key to spread the word about the gold mine and motivated a whole generation to come
*12:50.540- 12:57.000* :  to these jagged hills scarred by 2000 years of gold mining to say enough is enough.
*12:57.100- 13:02.740* :  The project would have involved raising two villages and two mountains to the ground and
*13:02.740- 13:09.520* :  flooding a whole valley to create a toxic lake for the cyanide-laced water used to extract the gold.
*13:10.100- 13:16.800* :  They wanted to blow up this mountain, König Mountain, the one you see there. There are four
*13:16.800- 13:24.140* :  open pits, the largest from Europe and they wanted to deposit all this cyanide lake all the waste
*13:24.140- 13:30.320* :  behind König Mountain. Tika Dadea cycled here twice all the way from Copenhagen where he was
*13:30.320- 13:35.360* :  studying to take part in the festival and the protest. He fell in love with the place,
*13:35.360- 13:40.860* :  borrowed enough money to buy half a building in the main square and set up a high-quality
*13:40.860- 13:46.160* :  marino wool business in the town. He now employs 40 local women.
*13:46.540- 13:53.420* :  It's a small, tailoring workshop. New machines, we bought very good new machines. The lady gave me a
*13:53.420- 13:59.380* :  pair of woolen socks as a present, yeah, and I posted on Facebook a picture and yeah we take
*13:59.380- 14:04.660* :  quarters from all kinds of people through Facebook Messenger that we got disorders and I've started
*14:04.660- 14:11.180* :  to find the ladies to eat all these socks. By the time the protesters stopped the mine 10 years ago,
*14:11.180- 14:18.280* :  the Canadian company Rosia Montana Gold Corporation owned 80% of the houses. They still do.
*14:18.280- 14:25.140* :  Local people who supported the project because of the promise of investment and jobs were aghast
*14:25.520- 14:29.840* :  and blamed the environmentalists. Tika and his knitted line of products,
*14:29.840- 14:36.680* :  called Made in Rosia Montana, is part of the answer. Another contribution comes from the
*14:36.680- 14:44.800* :  architect. This is the Unitarian Parish House. When we arrived here it was no longer inhabited
*14:45.080- 14:50.060* :  and it was collapsed with the roofing. A leading figure in the protest movement,
*14:50.060- 14:56.580* :  Claudia Apostol works with a team of 30 architecture students from all over Romania restoring
*14:56.580- 15:03.480* :  old houses in the village. In a noisy workspace as students sandpaper down and repair the
*15:03.480- 15:09.540* :  frames of house and church windows, I asked her if she felt the victory against the mine project
*15:09.540- 15:19.540* :  is final. As long as we have 300 tons of gold underneath us, we will never win. There will
*15:19.540- 15:30.620* :  always be pressure here. This is how the world works, unfortunately. But I'm 30 to now. I just hope
*15:30.720- 15:38.080* :  to live the day to see this community yield and aware of what they really have.
*15:46.420- 15:52.000* :  What she means is the natural beauty of these Transylvenian hills and the close-knit community
*15:52.000- 15:58.300* :  looking out for each other. But for now there's a legal stalemate in Rosia Montana. The company
*15:58.300- 16:06.020* :  has sued the Romanian state at the World Bank Tribunal in Washington for $4.5 billion in compensation.
*16:07.020- 16:11.040* :  The future of Romania's ore mountains still hangs in the balance.
*16:12.100- 16:20.820* :  That report by Nick Thorpe. Still to come? What do you work for? Home land. Okay.
*16:21.520- 16:26.880* :  Male and female get into with anybody? Yeah. What was the story with that? They were just drunk
*16:26.880- 16:33.360* :  and whose handcuffs is he wearing? Mine. The fake police officer who was arrested by a real one.
*16:40.860- 16:47.180* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys. This is the story of one
*16:47.180- 16:53.320* :  of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed. Like I had never seen anything like this. At the height
*16:53.320- 16:59.660* :  of Abercrombian fits his success. This was me being carefully manipulated. Being lied to tricks
*16:59.820- 17:05.880* :  and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money
*17:05.880- 17:13.040* :  sex and power. This is world of secrets. Season one. The Abercrombie guys.
*17:13.360- 17:15.460* :  Listen wherever you get your podcasts.
*17:21.760- 17:27.160* :  Live's less ordinary is the podcast with astonishing personal stories from across the globe.
*17:27.160- 17:33.280* :  You are the only survivor. I say how could a pod orders city or die? Expect the unexpected.
*17:33.900- 17:38.040* :  We were having a big, tearful discussion. How could someone ever do this? How could that ever happen?
*17:38.380- 17:42.940* :  And that's the first time I ever came out with my story about how I was almost a school shooter.
*17:43.420- 17:49.360* :  Live's less ordinary from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:50.880- 17:54.880* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. As we heard in the earlier edition,
*17:54.880- 18:00.800* :  the jailed Iranian Human Rights Activist, Nagar Samhamedi, has won this year's Nobel Peace Prize.
*18:00.800- 18:06.940* :  The committee in Oslo hailed her fight for freedom and democracy. These women on the streets of
*18:06.940- 18:13.900* :  the Iranian capital, Tehran, welcomed the award. I am overjoyed and Iranian women has been
*18:13.900- 18:18.500* :  honoured with the prize. I hope that this will pave the way for all Iranian women to move forward.
*18:19.880- 18:24.240* :  I am proud since the Iranian woman has been chosen. I think it's time for other women in the
*18:24.240- 18:28.380* :  country to think about how we can form a strategy based on Nagar Samhamedi's success.
*18:29.620- 18:36.100* :  My colleague Anita Anand spoke to Masi Al-Enazad, an Iranian activist who now lives in New York.
*18:36.100- 18:41.500* :  She was also nominated for this year's Nobel Prize and has known as Mohamedi for many years.
*18:42.440- 18:49.820* :  Nagar was the one who deserved to win this because, hey, she is the one fighting back the oppressive
*18:49.820- 18:57.000* :  regime. It feels good because I believe that women of Iran deserve to have louder voice across the
*18:57.000- 19:01.820* :  globe. Masi, tell me, I mean, you've known her for some time. When did you first meet and what does
*19:01.820- 19:08.040* :  she like? Oh, I first met Nagar when I was a parliamentary journalist. First, I heard her voice.
*19:08.640- 19:15.380* :  All her friends know that Nagar has a loud voice when it comes to challenging the
*19:15.960- 19:20.740* :  oppressive policy makers. So she was challenging one of the member of the parliament about the
*19:20.740- 19:28.040* :  situation of political prisoners. Twenty years ago, since that, she herself become a political
*19:28.040- 19:35.780* :  prisoner and not just a victim. Inside the prison, she was the one interviewing young activists and
*19:35.780- 19:42.220* :  those who were suffering the Islamic Republic, brutal behavior, and she became a voice for
*19:42.220- 19:46.880* :  political prisoners from inside prison as well. It seems like somebody who just doesn't have
*19:46.880- 19:52.820* :  an off button and doesn't stop. That's why I believe that this price, to me, it's giving a better
*19:52.820- 20:01.100* :  picture to the world about Iranian women. Wounded, but unbound, unbreakable. Like Nagarghist,
*20:01.320- 20:07.880* :  the day that Nagarghist won this prize, 16-year-old girl, Armita Garavan, is in a coma,
*20:07.960- 20:13.340* :  fighting for her life right after being beaten up by Morality Police, right on the anniversary
*20:13.340- 20:18.320* :  of Massa, I mean, another girl who got killed in the hand of Morality Police. So that is why I
*20:18.320- 20:25.460* :  believe that the world is trying to recognize this woman-led revolution. But what Nagarghist would
*20:25.460- 20:30.600* :  have said, if it was not me, her giving interview to you, she would have said that the real prize
*20:30.600- 20:35.620* :  is that the world stopped legitimizing this gender apartheid regime.
*20:35.900- 20:42.560* :  What is it about people like Nagarghist, people like yourself, who at such great personal cost
*20:42.560- 20:49.600* :  just refused to bow down before this? I mean, you yourself have been the victim of an assassination
*20:49.600- 20:57.160* :  attempt, a kidnapped plot. Life is not easy when you speak out against the regime. It's not. Not
*20:57.160- 21:03.920* :  only for yourself, but your family members. Look, Nagarghist is being away from her two children
*21:03.920- 21:11.380* :  for long time. And many mothers who's beloved one got killed, they are in prison. Right now,
*21:11.540- 21:15.920* :  they are with Nagarghist Mahamadi and many other, you know, young women who just removed their
*21:15.920- 21:21.940* :  hijab, they're being harassed in prison, they face rape in prison. But you're right, I myself was
*21:21.940- 21:28.500* :  the target of assassination plot on U.S. Soyd, but we have only two options. To be miserable,
*21:29.400- 21:34.500* :  or to make our oppressors feel miserable, we choose the second one, because we believe that
*21:34.500- 21:41.640* :  the time has come for us, women of Iran, to get rid of this barbaric regime. And I know that it's
*21:41.640- 21:48.620* :  not easy, but at the same time, we made the life for this barbaric, clerical regime difficult as
*21:48.620- 21:55.400* :  well. That gives us hope. Mahsi, we have no idea whether this broadcast will reach Nagarghist,
*21:55.500- 21:59.440* :  but you know, strange things have happened. We've heard of prisoners who sometimes managed to hear
*21:59.440- 22:05.500* :  broadcasts, even behind bars. If you had the chance to talk directly to her on this day that she
*22:05.500- 22:10.980* :  wins the Nobel Peace Prize, what would you say to her? Nagarghist, I know that you yourself
*22:12.180- 22:19.280* :  sacrificed your life to give voice to voice this people. And I'm pretty like sure that you are now
*22:19.280- 22:24.480* :  happy because you know that the world will pay attention to Iranian women more and more.
*22:24.480- 22:31.340* :  Your dream is to get rid of their religious dictatorship and have a secular democracy. We are united
*22:32.080- 22:39.940* :  with you to bring this regime down. Mahsi Alina Jad, an Iranian activist. A multi-million dollar
*22:39.940- 22:45.580* :  lawsuit brought against the former King of Spain Juan Carlos by his ex-lover has been thrown out by
*22:45.580- 22:51.540* :  London's high court. She accused him of harassing her after she refused to return tens of millions
*22:51.540- 22:56.920* :  of dollars of gifts, but the judge ruled that the English court could not rule on the dispute
*22:56.920- 23:03.580* :  between them. Here's our European reporter, Paul Moss. It is, you might say, a scandal fit for a
*23:03.580- 23:10.100* :  king, but then Spain's former sovereign Juan Carlos I and his family have long had pretty colorful
*23:10.100- 23:15.940* :  lives. The King's daughter, Princess Cristina, stood trial, charged with assisting a fraud operation
*23:15.940- 23:21.860* :  run by her husband. He went to jail, she was acquitted, but was forced to drop her royal title.
*23:22.480- 23:27.860* :  The King himself was always the subject of pretty lurid gossip, but it turned concrete when the
*23:27.860- 23:33.740* :  King was found to have gone on a luxury elephant hunting trip to Botswana. Firstly, Spain was in
*23:33.740- 23:40.220* :  the midst of economic crisis, so people were not to impress by this display of opulence. But also
*23:40.220- 23:46.040* :  killing elephants wasn't exactly a good look for the King, given he was local president of the
*23:46.040- 23:51.800* :  World Wildlife Fund. Then it turned out he'd brought with him to Botswana his not-so-secret
*23:51.800- 23:58.180* :  lover, Carina, Zhu Zain, Vickandstein, Zain. All these events led to Juan Carlos abdicating,
*23:58.180- 24:04.140* :  and at some point it seems he lost his lover too. Miss Zain, Vickandstein Zain says the King
*24:04.140- 24:10.140* :  asked her to return lots of jewelry and artwork he'd gifted her. She refused and he
*24:10.140- 24:16.560* :  allegedly sent people to her home, issuing threats, so she sued him. According to the King,
*24:16.560- 24:23.020* :  today's court decision confirmed his innocence, but the judge only ruled that a UK court didn't
*24:23.020- 24:28.820* :  have jurisdiction over this affair. Whether the events really happened, well that will be up to
*24:28.820- 24:35.140* :  history to decide, and perhaps another court case. Paul Moss, here in the UK the
*24:35.140- 24:40.740* :  Data Watchdog has told SNAP, the company which owns the Messaging App, SNAP Chat, that it might
*24:40.740- 24:47.720* :  have to stop offering its artificial intelligence chatbot, MyAI. The Information Commissioner's office
*24:47.720- 24:52.700* :  said its initial inquiries suggested there could be privacy risks with the platform,
*24:52.700- 24:57.940* :  especially for children. With more details, here's our tech reporter, Shionna McCallum.
*24:58.660- 25:03.640* :  SNAP Chat is an instant messaging app that allows you to send pictures and videos to your friends,
*25:03.640- 25:10.180* :  which once opened disappear. It's particularly popular with under 18s and has obligations under
*25:10.180- 25:15.540* :  data protection laws to keep their data private, which is what the Information Commissioner's office
*25:15.540- 25:21.260* :  has been looking at. The Watchdog's findings suggest there was a failure by SNAP to adequately
*25:21.260- 25:26.860* :  identify and assess the privacy risks to children before it launched its artificial intelligence
*25:26.940- 25:34.120* :  chatbot, MyAI. This includes a raft of measures, things like geolocation, so not making it clear if
*25:34.120- 25:39.920* :  the chatbot was tracking its users. SNAP chatters can ask questions, get it to plan activities,
*25:39.920- 25:45.860* :  or even give advice. As a result of the privacy concerns, the Watchdog has sent what's known as
*25:45.860- 25:51.600* :  a preliminary enforcement notice to the tech giant. If adopted, SNAP might not be able to offer
*25:51.600- 25:57.360* :  the chatbot in the UK until a proper risk assessment has been carried out. It now has a chance
*25:57.360- 26:04.960* :  to respond before the regulator makes its final decision. Shionna McCallum, now to the United States.
*26:06.080- 26:16.000* :  Five, four, three, two, one. We have ignition and lift off of the United Launch Alliance Atlas
*26:16.000- 26:20.620* :  Five rocket carrying the prototype mission for Amazon's project Kuiper.
*26:22.200- 26:27.860* :  Amazon has successfully launched two satellites into orbit as part of the company's plans to provide
*26:27.860- 26:33.540* :  internet access from space. They blasted off on a rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida.
*26:34.180- 26:39.360* :  The firm wants to create a network of thousands of satellites that could compete with Elon Musk's
*26:39.360- 26:45.200* :  Starlink system. There's a rapidly growing market for high-speed internet that's bounced across
*26:45.200- 26:51.060* :  the sky rather than through fiber connections on the ground. Stuart Martin is the chief executive
*26:51.060- 26:57.100* :  of satellite applications catapult, which provides space technology services. He explained what
*26:57.100- 27:04.020* :  Amazon's owner, Jeff Bezos, is trying to achieve. So satellite communications is nothing new. We've
*27:04.020- 27:09.980* :  been doing this for about 30 years, but the way that we used to do it was by putting one big satellite
*27:10.480- 27:16.620* :  very high up in the sky, sort of 36,000 kilometers away, so that with one satellite we could see half
*27:16.620- 27:21.720* :  the Earth. But what we're doing now is we're taking advantage of the way that this technology has
*27:21.740- 27:29.260* :  moved on, and we can move the satellites much closer to Earth so that rather than having that very
*27:29.260- 27:34.980* :  long time delay that we're familiar with with previous satellite communications, we get much more
*27:34.980- 27:40.540* :  instantaneous communications like we used to with our phone lines and with our normal internet.
*27:41.140- 27:48.160* :  And so we're ending up with an alternative internet infrastructure in orbit rather than via the
*27:48.160- 27:52.760* :  network of fiber cables we have running under the oceans and through tunnels and over the mountains.
*27:52.760- 27:57.860* :  It is a new type of space infrastructure that's being developed, and it's going to be interesting
*27:57.860- 28:04.600* :  to see now where they take it. It's very much like when the internet was new in the late
*28:04.600- 28:10.880* :  1990s, early 2000s, then all of a sudden that stimulated the whole new innovation set of
*28:10.880- 28:15.420* :  innovation between companies figuring out how they can use this infrastructure to do new and
*28:15.420- 28:21.840* :  innovative things. Jeff Bezos has spoken publicly about how his reason for starting Amazon and his
*28:21.840- 28:28.620* :  desire to create the wealth, accumulate the wealth that he has, has always been to pursue his
*28:28.620- 28:32.780* :  objectives in space. Maybe he's going to move his cloud infrastructure into space, if he's
*28:32.780- 28:37.500* :  going to move the internet into space, then perhaps the Amazon cloud can go into space and get
*28:37.500- 28:43.820* :  freed from the environmental damage that we know all these server farms produce at the moment.
*28:43.820- 28:48.780* :  It's very exciting. Stuart Martin of the satellite applications catapult company.
*28:50.040- 28:56.160* :  Video has emerged of a chance encounter last month in the US state of Georgia that resulted in a
*28:56.160- 29:01.900* :  fake police officer who tried to arrest a member of the public being arrested himself.
*29:02.280- 29:06.580* :  This time by a real police officer, Lippeca Pelham picks up the tail.
*29:07.360- 29:11.220* :  When Atlanta police officers responded to a reported car accident,
*29:11.220- 29:17.360* :  they found that an apparently intoxicated man was handcuffed inside an SUV. The driver,
*29:17.360- 29:23.700* :  Patricia Smith was standing outside the car and told the officers that the man was her husband
*29:23.700- 29:30.120* :  Samuel Smith. She said that a police officer had put him in handcuffs at a nearby strip club.
*29:30.500- 29:34.020* :  This was the moment her account was recorded on the officer's body cam.
*29:40.220- 29:45.520* :  The police arrested both passengers on an outstanding warrant and other traffic charges.
*29:46.100- 29:50.940* :  Then they went to the strip club and there they found the fake officer, Terence Jax.
*29:51.420- 29:56.160* :  What you work for? Homeland. Okay. Did y'all have some f***ing up here a little bit ago?
*29:57.260- 30:02.620* :  Mail a female get into with anybody? Yeah. He had a firearm and a radio. He was wearing a vest
*30:02.620- 30:07.440* :  as well as brandishing a department of Homeland Security Special Agent badge.
*30:07.880- 30:11.560* :  The investigating officer asked him what happened in the club a little while ago
*30:11.940- 30:14.760* :  with the man and the woman and if he had handcuffed the man.
*30:15.020- 30:19.800* :  What was the story with that? They would just drop and out. Who's handcuffs is he wearing?
*30:19.800- 30:27.280* :  My, he took off. He jumped in the SUV and took off. Terence Jax's story somehow didn't add up.
*30:27.580- 30:30.500* :  Here's what I want you to do for me, okay? I'm going to take you fine. How much for side?
*30:32.940- 30:36.260* :  Right now you are not under arrest. You're just being detained for the investigation here.
*30:36.260- 30:41.920* :  As one officer handcuffed Terence Jax another went to his car which had blue flashing lights.
*30:41.920- 30:45.960* :  It turned out the license plate was stolen from his school bus.
*30:46.560- 30:51.020* :  The license plate is off of a bluebird school bus from, uh, from Tucker, Georgia.
*30:51.340- 30:56.660* :  Further investigation revealed there was no special agent called Terence Jax in the department
*30:56.660- 31:02.360* :  of Homeland Security. He was in fact a security guard at this drip club. He admitted to putting
*31:02.360- 31:08.660* :  handcuffs on Samuel Smith by presenting himself as an agent. Terence Jax was arrested on charges
*31:08.660- 31:14.880* :  of impersonating a public officer. Lepica Palin. Now if you fancy going to the movies,
*31:14.880- 31:20.420* :  here's news of one of this year's highly anticipated films. Killers of the Flower Moon
*31:20.420- 31:26.460* :  directed by Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio star in this epic
*31:26.460- 31:33.740* :  western which is being released worldwide this month. It lasts for three and a half hours and
*31:33.740- 31:38.920* :  if you think that's too long to stay in a theater for don't worry it's also available on streaming.
*31:38.940- 31:44.660* :  The BBC's Tom Brook went to meet the veteran filmmaker in his home city of New York.
*31:46.460- 31:51.660* :  Martin Scorsese has made some of American cinemas most memorable films, some taxi driver.
*31:51.980- 31:56.260* :  You talking to me? The good fellows. Never ran on your friends and always keep your
*31:56.260- 31:59.760* :  merch from raging bull. There's no one else around once they're fighting, they're all afraid.
*32:00.980- 32:08.840* :  To the Irishman to mention just a few. He's latest epic, Killers of the Flower Moon,
*32:08.860- 32:14.980* :  an adaptation of a book, stars Scorsese acting stalwarts Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio.
*32:19.760- 32:24.440* :  It's about love and deceit but perhaps more than anything else it's about naked greed.
*32:24.440- 32:29.140* :  This wealth should come to us. It's also for this veteran New York filmmaker
*32:29.140- 32:33.920* :  he's very first Western. One of my favorite genres is the Western.
*32:36.460- 32:42.740* :  Back in the 40s and 50s I grew up watching Westerns and really growing up as an urban kid in the
*32:42.740- 32:48.220* :  lower east side living in tenements and not allowed to go near animals or run in play because
*32:48.220- 32:52.820* :  I had an asthma. The Western opened up a business for me in black and white and
*32:52.820- 32:58.080* :  technicolored etc. It was a fantasy land. Money flows really here now.
*32:58.100- 33:02.700* :  Killers of the Flower Moon tells of the slow cruel poisoning of the so-called reign of terror
*33:02.700- 33:08.580* :  of the 1920s in Oklahoma in which more than 60 Native Americans were killed by white interlopers
*33:08.780- 33:13.400* :  wanting to get their hands on the oil that lay on their land. When this money started coming
*33:15.060- 33:16.980* :  we should have known it came with something else.
*33:18.860- 33:24.480* :  Oil had made the Ossetian nation extremely wealthy. Scorsese believes his New York upbringing helped
*33:24.480- 33:29.360* :  him understand the story. I grew up in an area that was kind of you know that was a great deal of
*33:29.560- 33:36.080* :  street crime, organized crime etc. And I found it was the same thinking in this story. Now you could
*33:36.080- 33:42.620* :  take it from robbing somebody's store mugging somebody let's say or take it to the point of wiping
*33:42.620- 33:49.700* :  out a nation indigenous nation. It is a period film in that it was set in Oklahoma in the 1920s
*33:50.320- 33:56.700* :  but in many ways it's about greedy white men doing terrible things to another race. Do you think
*33:57.360- 34:01.880* :  that has contemporary relevance in America today? That hasn't changed. It hasn't changed
*34:01.880- 34:07.080* :  around the world. I mean you're saying white but there are others who do that too in different parts
*34:07.080- 34:12.200* :  of the world. So in terms of America the struggle is always there the opportunity to make a change
*34:12.200- 34:21.000* :  is there too. The only thing is we have to know about it. American cinema has enjoyed great
*34:21.000- 34:27.360* :  critical and commercial success recently with two blockbusters Barbie and Oppenheim. You are the
*34:27.360- 34:33.680* :  men who gave them the power to destroy themselves. Films in which the single artistic vision of a
*34:33.680- 34:40.220* :  director prevailed that is what Martin Scorsese really values artistic control and you get the
*34:40.220- 34:44.520* :  sense that with killers of the flower moon which was funded by Apple Films at the tune of $200
*34:44.520- 34:49.760* :  million he got his way. I never felt that there were people looking over my shoulder and you
*34:49.760- 34:54.040* :  could say well it's because you you know you who you are and the yeah but I'm 80 years old now right
*34:54.300- 34:58.160* :  all right so now I was able to make a picture with nobody looking over my shoulder in a sense
*34:59.000- 35:03.760* :  if they were they were very quiet. You mentioned getting older I mean actually I'm only 10 years
*35:03.760- 35:09.960* :  behind you I'm 70. Oh my I mean I remember you when you when you had no weight in the in the mustache.
*35:09.960- 35:16.360* :  Okay well yeah that's true. Now look at this yes yeah no you look pretty good let me let me tell you
*35:16.520- 35:23.020* :  but how does getting older affect the kinds of storytelling that you want to do as a filmmaker are
*35:23.020- 35:27.740* :  their films that you feel you've got to do before it's too late. I know and the funny thing is I have
*35:27.740- 35:32.460* :  a few I really want to do I hope I can make it it comes down to wait a spend whatever time has
*35:32.460- 35:40.680* :  left to your life telling a story is it worth it to you. One respected critic has called
*35:40.680- 35:46.220* :  killers of the flower moon a landmark motion picture achievement that must bring considerable
*35:46.220- 35:51.840* :  pleasure to Martin Scorsese who hadn't always had it easy he battled asthma as a child dealt with
*35:51.840- 35:58.020* :  drug addiction and has been through several divorces but over a 55 year long career his filmmaking
*35:58.020- 36:06.340* :  at least has brought him and many of us a great deal of satisfaction. Tom Brock there who was
