*00:43.840- 00:48.980* :  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Saturday the 14th of October, these are our main stories.
*00:48.980- 00:54.980* :  The UN Secretary-General has warned that the situation in Gaza has reached a dangerous new low,
*00:54.980- 01:01.100* :  as Israel prepares for what looks like a huge ground offensive. And Israel says its soldiers have
*01:01.100- 01:07.300* :  already carried out localized raids in Gaza, looking for people kidnapped by Hamas during its assault
*01:07.300- 01:20.620* :  last Saturday. Also in this podcast, Nasser is on its way to an asteroid. Could we mind them in the future?
*01:24.520- 01:30.200* :  We begin in Gaza, where yesterday people in northern Gaza were told by the Israeli military,
*01:30.200- 01:37.000* :  they had 24 hours to leave and move to the south of the strip. Israel has advised around one
*01:37.000- 01:43.440* :  million people to depart the area. Hundreds of motorbikes, cars and trucks some loaded with mattresses
*01:43.440- 01:49.440* :  and other belongings have been seen heading south. Some people are leaving on foot. The Palestinian
*01:49.440- 01:54.920* :  health ministry says more than 1,900 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.
*01:55.580- 02:01.360* :  Israel says more than 1,300 of its citizens were killed during the Hamas attacks last Saturday.
*02:01.980- 02:06.580* :  The organisation is designated as a terror group by countries including the United Kingdom.
*02:07.280- 02:12.800* :  A UN agency operating in the region Unrah has called the Israeli order Herendus, describing
*02:12.800- 02:16.960* :  Gaza now as a hellhole. Julia Tumar works for the agency.
*02:17.320- 02:22.280* :  We've been very stretched over the past few days. Our teams on the ground have been working
*02:22.280- 02:28.680* :  around the clock to give people whatever was possible to give them. But we ran out. We ran out of
*02:28.680- 02:34.300* :  basic supplies like matrices, like hygiene kits, like water. We are very, very stretched.
*02:34.420- 02:39.460* :  And this is because we were not able to bring any supplies in. Unrah was not able to bring
*02:39.460- 02:44.340* :  anything into Gaza. A few hours later the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
*02:44.340- 02:49.460* :  made clear how worried he is. After days of airstrikes, the Israeli defence forces
*02:49.460- 02:55.220* :  have ordered the Palestinians in Gaza City and its surroundings to move to the south of the territory.
*02:56.760- 03:03.880* :  Moving more than 1,000,000 people across a densely populated war zone to a place with no food,
*03:04.440- 03:10.220* :  water or accommodation, when the entire territory is under siege is extremely dangerous
*03:11.060- 03:18.120* :  and in some cases simply not possible. Hospitals in the south of Gaza are already at capacity
*03:18.920- 03:22.540* :  and will not be able to accept thousands of new patients from the north.
*03:23.900- 03:27.620* :  The health system is on the brink of collapse. Marks are overflowing.
*03:28.620- 03:34.020* :  11 health care staff have been killed while on duty and there have been 34 attacks on
*03:34.020- 03:39.860* :  else facilities in the past few days. The entire territory faces a water crisis,
*03:40.300- 03:45.860* :  as infrastructure has been damaged and there is no electricity to power pumps and decolonization
*03:45.920- 03:52.340* :  plants. Our United Nations staff and our partners are working around the clock to support
*03:52.340- 03:59.560* :  the people of Gaza. We mourn for our colleagues, we have been killed, a number that is increasing
*04:00.120- 04:04.460* :  by the day. I've been in constant contact with the leaders across the region,
*04:05.160- 04:09.580* :  focus on ways to reduce suffering and prevent further dangerous escalation in the West Bank
*04:09.580- 04:15.860* :  or elsewhere in the region, especially in southern Lebanon. The exchange of fire across the
*04:15.860- 04:24.160* :  blue line is very worrying. It must stop. We need the immediate humanitarian access throughout Gaza
*04:25.000- 04:31.680* :  so that we can get food and water to everyone in need. Even wars have rules. International
*04:31.680- 04:37.560* :  humanitarian law and human rights law must be respected and upheld. Civilians must be protected
*04:38.280- 04:44.860* :  and also never use the shields. And all hostages in Gaza must be released immediately.
*04:45.800- 04:50.440* :  The UN Secretary-General Antoni Guterres. Well, my colleague Matthew and Rolly Waller spoke to
*04:50.440- 04:57.220* :  Dima Ganem, who has moved south from Gaza City to Karnunis. What was her reaction when she first
*04:57.220- 05:02.980* :  heard the 24-hour order from the Israeli authorities? When they first told us to evacuate,
*05:03.020- 05:11.160* :  I was so terrified and I couldn't, like, I've never imagined that my home would be evacuated.
*05:11.160- 05:18.960* :  It was really terrifying. So everything is going towards the end now. And they told us to go
*05:18.960- 05:26.800* :  to the southern part of the stretch, which is certainly not 10 to 8 days. But we are taking
*05:26.800- 05:32.740* :  our cancers and considering what their state scenarios. Tell me how difficult it's been
*05:33.520- 05:40.500* :  to get to where you are so far from Gaza City. The last few hours, how difficult has the movement
*05:40.500- 05:48.100* :  been? Very difficult. People were crammed in the truth and some people were walking in the
*05:48.100- 05:56.980* :  rhythm of the day and seeing some of their houses to unknown destinations. And they were
*05:57.620- 06:04.200* :  walking with carrying their mattresses and bags back. Some people are camping in the street.
*06:04.620- 06:12.120* :  80% of these populations doesn't have cars, so they just walking.
*06:12.660- 06:18.680* :  Did you have a car earlier and in terms of where you got to now, what is there for you?
*06:19.060- 06:26.580* :  Maybe it's safe. Now I am in the southern side now. So we are looking for a flat
*06:27.260- 06:35.760* :  to go to because no place to go, one million people just evacuated their houses. So there is no
*06:35.760- 06:42.700* :  place in the south. It's difficult to find a place. Well, despite the fact that people like Dima
*06:42.700- 06:48.820* :  have moved, Hamas has urged people to ignore the evacuation order. The Palestinian ambassador
*06:48.820- 06:54.400* :  to the United Nations, Riyadh Mansour, told reporters that the Israeli demand for Gaza residents
*06:54.400- 07:02.360* :  to leave their homes, amounted to a crime against humanity. There is no place in Gaza that is safe.
*07:03.000- 07:08.260* :  Every place in Gaza is dangerous. So, therefore, we need to stop this war immediately.
*07:08.540- 07:15.700* :  We need to send convoys of food and medicine to help the people there. And we need to stop
*07:15.700- 07:20.980* :  this ethnic cleansing from taking place. Well, to get more details about the current situation
*07:21.060- 07:25.540* :  from our Middle East correspondent Yalan Gnell, I spoke to her in Jerusalem.
*07:26.260- 07:30.460* :  You could see on footage, Israeli drones overhead, dropping these flyers. They were kind of
*07:30.460- 07:35.900* :  raining down on the streets of Gaza City. People holding up these flyers, which said on them,
*07:36.120- 07:40.920* :  evacuate your homes immediately and go south. There was an arrow on a map that pointed the way.
*07:41.360- 07:46.720* :  And although Hamas has been telling people not to leave saying this is psychological warfare,
*07:47.320- 07:53.320* :  quite quickly, colleagues in Gaza were reporting they could see long lines of Palestinians on the move.
*07:53.320- 07:59.100* :  Some people had got vehicles. They still had enough fuel left to drive cars or pick up trucks
*07:59.640- 08:05.060* :  down towards the south. They had mattresses, bundles on the top. But there were also families
*08:05.060- 08:09.760* :  who were just heading there on foot. Some of them leading their animals, those that come from the
*08:09.760- 08:15.600* :  more rural parts of the north of the Gaza Strip, the outskirts of Gaza City. We're not quite sure
*08:15.600- 08:20.800* :  of the numbers. I've seen some reports of thousands, but it's really not clear yet. Of course,
*08:20.800- 08:25.260* :  the UN and others have been saying that this could have dire humanitarian consequences.
*08:25.840- 08:30.240* :  The demand from Israel for this to happen, supposedly within 24 hours, there's been
*08:30.240- 08:34.980* :  some clarification from the Israeli military during the day saying that they know an evacuation
*08:34.980- 08:40.060* :  will take longer than that. But they are insisting that this is something that civilians must do
*08:40.060- 08:46.580* :  for their own safety. They're saying that the Hamas militants hide, the terrorist hide,
*08:46.960- 08:49.760* :  you'll have gallant, the Israeli Defence Minister said, in the course of the day,
*08:50.120- 08:54.940* :  among the civil population. So we need to separate them. Those who want to save their lives,
*08:54.940- 08:59.780* :  please go south. We're going to destroy Hamas infrastructures, the Hamas military establishment.
*08:59.780- 09:04.540* :  And he said we're going to take this phenomenon out of Gaza and out of the earth.
*09:04.860- 09:10.740* :  And that's the logic behind this. Is it behind Israel's order to evacuate, get the civilians out,
*09:10.740- 09:16.760* :  those who want to go. And what's left is Hamas legitimate targets for the IDF when this
*09:17.040- 09:22.840* :  incursion comes, if indeed it comes. What Israel is also really wanting to go after are some of the
*09:22.840- 09:28.380* :  underground sort of tunnel installations. It knows that Hamas has headquarters, that it has been
*09:28.380- 09:35.220* :  unable to get to successfully in previous conflicts. Of course, this is the fifth war that we've had
*09:35.220- 09:42.060* :  between Israel and militants in Gaza in the last 15 years. And this is the heaviest bombardment
*09:42.060- 09:48.900* :  by Israel that we have ever seen in response to just those awful dramatic attacks, the sudden
*09:48.900- 09:52.500* :  attacks by Hamas. And through the day in Israel as well, I should say,
*09:52.820- 09:56.440* :  few of us have been continuing to play place. We're still hearing that there are actually
*09:56.440- 10:00.600* :  dozens of bodies of people who were killed in the attacks that remain unidentified.
*10:00.600- 10:05.800* :  Yolanda Nell reporting, well, in recent days, Israeli forces have been massing near the border
*10:05.800- 10:11.420* :  with Gaza. On first day evening, the Israeli army said it had already launched some localized
*10:11.420- 10:17.180* :  raids into Gaza, as its forces prepared to launch a bigger, major ground offensive.
*10:17.700- 10:22.360* :  And Israeli military spokesman said the aim was to remove terrorists and search for hostages.
*10:22.920- 10:27.880* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's retaliation against the Hamas
*10:27.880- 10:36.580* :  attacks was only the beginning. We are striking at our enemies with unprecedented might.
*10:37.400- 10:43.340* :  I emphasize this is just the beginning. Our enemies have only begun paying the price.
*10:44.300- 10:49.660* :  I won't go into detail what is yet to come, but I tell you that this is only the beginning.
*10:50.620- 10:57.320* :  Israel last sent ground troops into Gaza in 2014, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers now on
*10:57.320- 11:02.220* :  or near the border. Southern Israel appears to be on a full war footing. Our correspondent,
*11:02.220- 11:07.500* :  Dan Johnson has been speaking to Israeli soldiers who may be involved in any coming ground war.
*11:08.040- 11:08.740* :  He sent this report.
*11:11.660- 11:16.600* :  Israel's military might has been moved into position ready for a possible assault on Gaza.
*11:18.080- 11:21.660* :  Israeli drivers were supporting their troops as the tanks rolled forward.
*11:22.420- 11:27.760* :  And we got through to Michael, a special forces soldier who seemed to know what his orders would be.
*11:28.020- 11:30.780* :  What's going to happen? I think everybody knows what's going to happen.
*11:31.760- 11:36.120* :  We want to take down Hamas. When we started, we decided to go to war,
*11:36.480- 11:41.540* :  and say, going to be a very different war that we knew before. I think we're going to go inside
*11:42.560- 11:47.960* :  and take down Hamas people. We do it in this for our country and we're going to fight for it all
*11:47.960- 11:54.900* :  the way. And now, like, you know, we're licking our wounds and it's not the time for us to cry.
*11:54.900- 11:59.360* :  We're going to have time to cry about our friends and our families. Even my three friends are
*11:59.400- 12:04.740* :  kidnapped over there. But now we have to go inside and stop it. We have to.
*12:05.380- 12:10.260* :  And this situation, we're telling the Gaza people to get out who's not involved.
*12:10.260- 12:16.460* :  Get out from the houses. Get out. Okay, because we're going to go in and we're going to go in
*12:16.460- 12:22.780* :  hard and strong. The strongest they ever saw. Are you confident you'll achieve your aim?
*12:23.220- 12:28.160* :  No doubt. No doubt. Gaza strip won't stay the same after this war.
*12:28.560- 12:31.280* :  And we are not afraid of this. I'm telling you that for sure.
*12:31.860- 12:37.400* :  In Tel Aviv, Israelis are considering what is to come next. They know people in Gaza have
*12:37.400- 12:43.340* :  been given a deadline of midnight to get to a place of safety. But that potentially could signal
*12:43.340- 12:48.020* :  a ground invasion. I don't feel safe after what's happened. I don't feel safe.
*12:48.300- 12:53.300* :  Would invading Gaza improve that? Of course. I don't know. I don't know. It's a
*12:53.300- 12:59.640* :  hard question to answer. I don't know if that's what will help or make things worse.
*12:59.820- 13:05.260* :  I don't think anyone knows. I just know that we can't keep living like that.
*13:08.020- 13:13.960* :  Aminan is really ambulance, which is driving into the basement of the main hospital here in Haifa.
*13:13.960- 13:20.780* :  This is a training run to prepare for using the emergency underground facilities here.
*13:20.780- 13:26.240* :  That are ready in case there are missile attacks, meaning large numbers of casualties,
*13:26.840- 13:32.720* :  or the hospital has to be evacuated underground. Down here, three levels beneath the hospital,
*13:32.720- 13:37.980* :  the beds go on and on and on. They got the alert the day after the attacks and this was
*13:37.980- 13:45.320* :  kicked it out in just three days. My name is Aminan. I'm the surgeon of the company that work here.
*13:45.680- 13:51.380* :  Haifa, where we are now, from Lebanon, the threat, the war. We had that was the last
*13:51.380- 13:57.660* :  threat and yeah, we are ready for everything to happen. We are aware that anything can happen
*13:57.660- 14:03.380* :  any moment. How does it feel to see the country preparing for war for more violence?
*14:03.780- 14:08.320* :  I hope nobody will need any bed here. And I'm thinking about today, you know, so today
*14:08.320- 14:14.160* :  the country is in the status of war. So for me, yeah, we're in war until someone will tell me we're
*14:14.160- 14:19.500* :  not in war anymore. The fact that an entire hospital can be relocated on the ground is a real
*14:19.500- 14:24.800* :  testament to Israel's funding and resourcing, its capacity in terms of emergency response,
*14:24.800- 14:31.840* :  healthcare. And it's military too, but the contrast with what the people of Gaza are enduring
*14:31.900- 14:39.580* :  with overwhelmed healthcare services, broken power supplies, lack of resources, it really
*14:39.580- 14:45.340* :  couldn't be starker. Dan Johnson reporting, well, one of the big concerns in this war is that
*14:45.340- 14:50.280* :  other countries may get drawn into the fighting. Here's Lebanon's foreign minister Abdallah
*14:50.280- 14:56.940* :  Buhabib speaking to the BBC. It looks like Israel is going all the way to demolish Gaza
*14:57.780- 15:05.660* :  with some kind of western support. This is not acceptable Arab-wise and not acceptable to many
*15:05.660- 15:12.800* :  groups in Lebanon and in Syria and in Jordan and in the West Bank. And therefore, there could be
*15:12.800- 15:19.700* :  an explosion. There could be a war, regional war. Tensions have been escalating along the border
*15:19.700- 15:26.200* :  between Lebanon and Israel. During Friday, there was cross-border fire from both sides. At least one
*15:26.200- 15:31.320* :  journalist was killed in southern Lebanon in what eyewitnesses say was Israeli shelling.
*15:31.320- 15:37.200* :  The Reuters news agency confirmed the death of its videographer Isam Abdullah and said two of
*15:37.200- 15:43.040* :  his colleagues had also been injured. Now, as the example of Hamas shows, it's not just nation states
*15:43.040- 15:48.100* :  that get involved. One of the biggest factions in Lebanon is Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed
*15:48.100- 15:54.040* :  Islamist group that's widely regarded as a terror organisation, including by the Arab League.
*15:54.040- 15:59.940* :  Its supporters held a rally in Beirut in support of Palestinians in Gaza. And the group's deputy
*15:59.940- 16:05.580* :  leader in Lebanon, Naim Qasam, said it was fully prepared to join Hamas in the war when the time
*16:08.280- 16:13.020* :  was right. We as Hezbollah contribute to the confrontation and will contribute to it within our
*16:13.020- 16:18.840* :  vision and our plan. We follow the move of the enemy and we are fully ready. When the time comes
*16:18.840- 16:24.380* :  for any action, we will carry it out. Well, the White House in Washington, D.C., has said that it
*16:24.380- 16:29.940* :  has seen no sign that Hezbollah is preparing to enter the conflict at the moment. Our correspondent
*16:29.940- 16:36.860* :  Hugo Bachega is in southern Lebanon. Here, there is tension because there is the question that
*16:36.860- 16:43.120* :  has been hanging over this country since this war started. What is Hezbollah going to do? I think
*16:43.120- 16:49.040* :  we've seen in the last few days that Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged rockets and shaling
*16:49.040- 16:55.160* :  several times since this conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out on Saturday. And yesterday
*16:55.160- 17:00.960* :  I was in a village near the blue line, which is the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel.
*17:00.960- 17:05.200* :  And there was almost nobody there. The only people who were there were checking the damage that
*17:05.200- 17:12.240* :  had been caused again after another round of violence between militants in Lebanon and Israel.
*17:12.920- 17:18.660* :  So I think lots of people here fear that Lebanon could be dragging to this conflict,
*17:18.700- 17:24.920* :  turning this into a regional war. And the latest incident happened just hours ago. The
*17:24.920- 17:29.580* :  Israeli military said they responded to an attack by Hezbollah in the south of the country
*17:29.580- 17:36.400* :  in a village called Al-Shahab. There was shaling from Israel and we're hearing now from our
*17:36.400- 17:42.260* :  colleagues at Al-Jazeera Arabic that at least two members of their team were wounded.
*17:42.260- 17:48.480* :  So what we're getting is limited military interactions between Hezbollah and the south of Lebanon
*17:49.100- 17:54.520* :  and Israeli forces. But so far that's all. But there is a huge concern I take it.
*17:55.120- 17:57.540* :  About the prospect of an escalation. Is that correct?
*17:58.100- 18:04.820* :  Exactly. I think what Hezbollah is trying to do is to show Israel that it is ready, it is prepared.
*18:04.860- 18:10.760* :  And I think these were the words used today by Hezbollah's number two who said we are prepared,
*18:10.760- 18:16.380* :  we are ready, we are following developments moment by moment. I think it was also very interesting
*18:16.380- 18:22.960* :  that he said that the group wouldn't be intimidated by calls being made by the US, by other countries.
*18:23.420- 18:30.140* :  Warning Hezbollah against any kind of involvement in this conflict. And I mean don't forget
*18:30.140- 18:35.820* :  the numbers here when we talk about Hezbollah. They say they've got 100,000 fighters. Many of them
*18:35.820- 18:41.000* :  were fighting in Syria have returned to the country so they're really well trained. Hezbollah
*18:41.000- 18:48.880* :  also has a vast arsenal of precision rockets that can hit Israel. Yesterday the US defense secretary
*18:48.880- 18:56.100* :  said there were no signs, clear signs that Hezbollah was planning to do something bigger, was
*18:56.100- 19:00.920* :  preparing to have a major involvement in this conflict. So we haven't seen the evidence yet
*19:00.920- 19:06.380* :  that Hezbollah is preparing to join Hamas in this war. But obviously there's a lot of concern here
*19:06.380- 19:12.240* :  on this side of the border. Hugo Bachega reporting from southern Lebanon. Diplomacy in the region
*19:12.240- 19:17.580* :  continues to try to end or at least limit the conflicts. America's Secretary of State says
*19:17.580- 19:22.400* :  Washington is working with Qatar to secure the release of hostages seized by Hamas.
*19:22.960- 19:28.060* :  Anthony Blinken was speaking after talks with the Qatari Prime Minister on the third leg of his
*19:28.060- 19:33.880* :  fast paced Middle East tour. At least 27 American nationals are known to be among those being
*19:33.880- 19:40.500* :  held in Gaza. Mr. Blinken repeated his full backing for Israel's war on Hamas but stressed the
*19:40.500- 19:47.100* :  importance of creating safe areas for civilians in Gaza. Our focus now is on helping to create
*19:47.100- 19:51.540* :  safe zones. And we're doing that with the leading international organizations. We're doing that
*19:51.540- 19:55.880* :  engaged with Israel. And we're working with other countries to that end. We think this is the
*19:55.900- 20:00.400* :  best way to make sure that civilians who are caught in a crossfire from Hamas is making
*20:00.400- 20:03.580* :  can be safe and receive the assistance they need.
*20:04.360- 20:08.740* :  We're meanwhile protests have been taking place across the Middle East in support of Palestinians
*20:08.740- 20:15.080* :  in Gaza, following a call for demonstrations by Hamas. At least nine Palestinian protesters were
*20:15.080- 20:20.820* :  killed by Israeli forces during clashes in towns and cities in the occupied West Bank.
*20:21.500- 20:28.020* :  There have also been big pro-Palestinian protests in Iran, Yemen, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon
*20:28.560- 20:34.840* :  as well as in other parts of Asia and Western cities. Jewish groups have held pro-Israel rallies in
*20:34.840- 20:40.380* :  both the US and Europe. Okay, let's step away from Gaza and Israel for now.
*20:41.200- 20:46.400* :  France's interior minister, Jair Al-Damanah, has said there was probably a link between what's
*20:46.400- 20:51.820* :  happening in the Middle East and an attack at a school in Arass in northern France. The teacher
*20:51.820- 20:56.880* :  was stabbed to death. Three other staff were injured before the attacker at the school was subdued.
*20:57.380- 21:02.680* :  Mr. Damanah said France was now on its highest state of alert. The attacker, who's of Chechen
*21:02.680- 21:07.820* :  origin and on a national register of Islamist radicals, was arrested at the scene. Hugh
*21:07.820- 21:12.520* :  Schofield reports from Paris. The attacker, who's been named as 20-year-old Russian national
*21:12.520- 21:18.200* :  Mohammed Maguchkov, arrived at the school in central Arass at around 11 o'clock. After stabbing
*21:18.200- 21:23.000* :  and killing a French teacher, he attacked a security guard and another teacher before being
*21:23.000- 21:28.940* :  overwhelmed. Witnesses say he shouted out Al-Ahu Akbar. All schools here, not just Jewish schools,
*21:28.940- 21:34.400* :  have been on alert since the Hamas attacks in Israel. President Macron came to the school to show
*21:34.400- 21:42.720* :  the nation's solidarity with staff and pupils. The best proof of our resolve is the decision of
*21:42.720- 21:47.640* :  the head teacher here to open the school tomorrow. It's a choice not to yield to terror, to let
*21:47.780- 21:52.940* :  nothing divide us and to recall our schools and education are at the center of the fight against
*21:52.940- 21:57.520* :  ignorance. Mohammed Maguchkov was known to the security services as a potential danger,
*21:57.520- 22:03.480* :  as a pupil at the school he'd alarmed teachers with his expressions of Islamic radicalism.
*22:03.660- 22:08.800* :  His attack comes three years almost to the day, since another killing of a teacher that horrified
*22:08.800- 22:14.440* :  France. Samuel Patti was beheaded at his school outside Paris after he showed a civics class
*22:14.440- 22:20.580* :  a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed. His killer was also a young Chechen man. Hugh Schofield.
*22:22.780- 22:26.500* :  And before we move on, let's hear about this weekend's happy poet with Andrew Peach.
*22:26.820- 22:30.380* :  Yes, there are many things in the world it's hard to feel positive about. One of them being
*22:30.380- 22:35.720* :  the climate crisis, but we've been talking to the tech giant Bill Gates and he says there are
*22:35.720- 22:40.960* :  reasons to look on the bright side. Also this week scientists in Spain on a new way of spotting
*22:40.960- 22:46.200* :  breast cancer, the Caribbean island that's been turned from a desolate rock to a wildlife haven,
*22:46.720- 22:50.760* :  and world records being smashed all over the place from the fastest marathon in Chicago
*22:51.440- 22:56.420* :  to the biggest pumpkin in Minnesota. Do join me for the happy part available in this feed or wherever
*22:56.420- 23:05.840* :  you get your BBC podcasts every Saturday. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*23:06.500- 23:11.180* :  People in New Zealand are voting in a general election today that appears likely to dislodge
*23:11.180- 23:16.400* :  the centre-left Labour government after six years in office. The soaring cost of living after
*23:16.400- 23:20.720* :  Covid lockdowns has been a key issue in the campaign, as Phil Mercer explains.
*23:21.380- 23:25.880* :  New Zealand's election is lacking the star power of the former Prime Minister Jacinda
*23:25.880- 23:32.940* :  Ardern. She resigned in January and her successor Chris Hipkins appears unlikely to form the next
*23:32.940- 23:38.680* :  government. The centre-right National Party is expected to have the largest share of the votes,
*23:39.160- 23:44.620* :  but might not have enough seats in Parliament to govern outright. The result of the election could
*23:44.620- 23:50.200* :  depend on the populist politician Winston Peters and his New Zealand First Party.
*23:50.760- 23:56.280* :  It's previously formed coalition governments with both the Labour and National Parties.
*23:56.960- 24:01.720* :  Now, for the first time, NASA has launched a mission to explore a metal-rich asteroid,
*24:02.200- 24:07.400* :  a small spacecraft is set off from Florida to land on psyche, which was discovered more than
*24:07.400- 24:14.340* :  170 years ago. Astronomers believe the asteroid is up to 60% iron and nickel, and could contain
*24:14.340- 24:20.620* :  vital clues about how our planet Earth came to exist. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amor
*24:20.620- 24:25.780* :  told us more. This asteroid is somewhere out beyond Mars, somewhere between Mars and Jupiter,
*24:26.380- 24:31.220* :  but we would like to know about the interior of the Earth. We have this metal core
*24:31.260- 24:36.960* :  at the centre of the Earth. We have a liquid core and also a solidified core as well,
*24:36.960- 24:41.720* :  this two-part core that we have. It's the thing that generates the magnetic field on Earth.
*24:41.720- 24:46.280* :  Now, we can't drill down to the Earth's core to study it. It's too far down,
*24:46.280- 24:51.720* :  6,000 kilometers or so. We want to go to somewhere where we might be able to see a core that is
*24:51.960- 24:58.100* :  exposed, and this is what psyche may be, Robin. It may be a core that developed in a planet that
*24:58.100- 25:02.960* :  failed right at the beginning of the solar system, so it kind of started to go like the Earth,
*25:02.960- 25:08.720* :  it developed a metal core, and then it stopped, and its exterior rock layers, we've still got our
*25:08.720- 25:14.520* :  rock layers, then got knocked off by asteroid impacts. Other asteroids bashing into it to leave
*25:14.620- 25:22.640* :  this exposed surface that we think is iron and nickel. We go to outer space to study inner space,
*25:22.640- 25:28.260* :  if you like. Let's put our commercial heads on and talk a little bit about asteroid mining.
*25:29.000- 25:34.300* :  Is it possible? Is there a potential for this? Well, I've seen someone try and calculate just
*25:34.320- 25:39.660* :  how much psyche might be worth if you would have put it on the metal markets here on planet Earth,
*25:39.900- 25:44.160* :  and it would be trillions and trillions of dollars. Of course, you'd completely flood the market,
*25:44.160- 25:49.360* :  the price would crash, but it would be an amazing resource, right? It's too far away to go mine,
*25:49.800- 25:54.640* :  but that hasn't stopped people thinking about mining asteroids that are nearer to Earth,
*25:54.740- 26:01.140* :  to look for some of the more precious metals, if we can call them that, the platinum,
*26:01.140- 26:07.920* :  the palladiums, these kinds of metals. It could happen in the future. We don't have the technology
*26:07.920- 26:13.840* :  to do it just yet. I think more near-term, what's likely to happen is you might see spacecraft
*26:13.840- 26:20.660* :  land on an asteroid, mine it for the resource that enables it then to carry on. It might mine
*26:20.660- 26:27.080* :  ices. If you get ices, water ices, you can split that up to make a rocket fuel and then you can
*26:27.080- 26:33.340* :  carry on. That's probably more near-term. Jonathan Amos on the asteroid. The government of
*26:33.340- 26:38.960* :  Bikina Faso says it has signed an agreement with Russia for the construction of a nuclear power plant.
*26:39.480- 26:45.560* :  It's military rulers who seized power just over a year ago have been strengthening ties with Moscow.
*26:46.140- 26:48.600* :  Our West Africa correspondent, Mayany Jones, has more.
*26:49.120- 26:51.900* :  News of the agreement will be welcomed in Bikina Faso,
*26:51.900- 26:57.780* :  where less than 23% of the population has access to electricity. The deal is part of the Bikina
*26:57.780- 27:04.100* :  B government's target for 95% of urban populations and 50% of rural ones to have access to electricity
*27:04.100- 27:10.420* :  by 2030. The agreement will sign the Russian Energy Week in Moscow, which was attended by Bikina Faso's
*27:10.420- 27:14.460* :  Energy Minister. According to Russia's State Atomic Energy Agency, Rosatom,
*27:14.780- 27:18.800* :  the agreement is the first between the two countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
*27:18.800- 27:23.520* :  It says it hopes it will be a first step towards greater cooperation for the use of nuclear
*27:23.520- 27:28.660* :  energy in manufacturing, agriculture and medicine. Now there's been quite a lot to take in and
*27:28.660- 27:34.580* :  digest in his podcast. So let's end it on this. A legend. The broadcaster and naturalist David
*27:34.580- 27:40.140* :  Attenborough is considered one of the world's most prominent environmentalists. So David, or just
*27:40.140- 27:45.140* :  plain Mr. Attenborough, as he was known back then, first appeared on a black and white TV screen
*27:45.140- 27:51.900* :  presenting a natural history program called ZooQuest in 1954. Since then, he's been highlighting
*27:51.900- 27:58.120* :  wildlife and environmental concerns around the world. Now at the age of 97, yes, 97,
*27:58.140- 28:04.100* :  he's bringing out another edition of his famous wildlife TV series Planet Earth. This one is
*28:04.100- 28:09.700* :  aptly named Planet Earth 3. There are programs that have been sold and seen around the world.
*28:10.100- 28:14.640* :  Well, our climate editor, Justin Rowlett, watched the new series and also rummaged through
*28:14.640- 28:20.400* :  Sir David's original documentaries from many years ago. After fortnight of traveling north,
*28:20.400- 28:27.800* :  we at last sighted Ray Nile. At 97, Sir David Attenborough has had a unique perspective on the
*28:27.800- 28:36.420* :  changes our species has wrought upon the planet. I was 31 and it was here that I first met a green
*28:36.420- 28:42.860* :  turtle. He first visited Ray Nile and off the coast of Australia way back in 1957.
*28:43.680- 28:50.580* :  And after a night spent laying maybe over 100 eggs, she is very weary and very anxious to get back
*28:50.580- 28:55.080* :  to the sea. These days the turtles face even greater perils.
*28:59.000- 29:02.840* :  The sex of baby turtles is determined by the temperature of the sand.
*29:04.900- 29:12.720* :  Rising temperatures mean 99% of them are now born female, threatening the future of the species.
*29:13.080- 29:20.300* :  This little fellow is newly hatched. Having at last successfully reached the water,
*29:20.920- 29:24.480* :  he's still got a great number of hazards to face before he grows up.
*29:26.940- 29:31.260* :  Little designer of them, what hazards that little turtle would have to face.
*29:32.600- 29:39.440* :  In the 66 years since my visit, Ray Nile and has remained the most important green turtle
*29:39.440- 29:45.620* :  nestingsite on the planet. The question is, can it last another lifetime?
*29:47.500- 29:50.460* :  But there is hope nature can rebound.
*29:54.000- 30:01.040* :  We will see how animals are adapting in extraordinary ways to survive the new challenges they face.
*30:01.100- 30:08.280* :  The images are stunning. At this crucial time in our history, we must now look at the world
*30:08.300- 30:16.020* :  through a new lens. The message is, we can still protect the wonders of nature.
*30:20.620- 30:24.660* :  Just in relapse on David Attenborough, still teaching us so much at 97.
*30:27.120- 30:31.300* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*30:31.300- 30:35.020* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*30:35.400- 30:39.980* :  you can send us an email. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*30:39.980- 30:44.620* :  You can also find us on X, formerly known as Twitter at Global NewsPod.
*30:44.980- 30:49.360* :  This edition was mixed brilliantly by Nick Randall. The producer was Liam McChefery,
*30:49.360- 30:52.720* :  the editor as always, Karen Martin. I'm Robin Brandt, thanks for listening.
*30:53.160- 30:54.140* :  Until next time, goodbye.
