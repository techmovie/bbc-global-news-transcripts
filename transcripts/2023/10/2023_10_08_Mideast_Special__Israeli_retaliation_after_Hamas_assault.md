*00:31.940- 00:34.340* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.

*01:01.260- 01:07.020* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this at midday GMT on Sunday the 8th of October.
*01:07.540- 01:11.240* :  More than a day after Hamas militants launched the surprise attack from Gaza,
*01:11.240- 01:16.300* :  gun battles are still raging in southern Israel. Hundreds of Israelis have been killed
*01:16.300- 01:17.920* :  and dozens taken hostage.
*01:18.260- 01:21.780* :  I was lying in the floor and they were going three by three, shooting.
*01:23.220- 01:27.040* :  Everywhere. And I saw many people dying all around.
*01:27.840- 01:31.840* :  In the Gaza Strip, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and thousands
*01:31.840- 01:33.980* :  been injured in Israeli airstrikes.
*01:34.360- 01:36.440* :  It was described as a slaughterhouse.
*01:36.900- 01:41.240* :  There were many dead bodies in the morning and the medical staff were unable to cope
*01:41.300- 01:44.960* :  with the huge influx of the casualties that they were receiving.
*01:45.640- 01:50.720* :  We'll hear from our correspondents in Jerusalem and Gaza and ask what this means for the Israelis
*01:50.720- 01:59.240* :  and Palestinians. Also in the podcast, the BBC speaks to a senior leader of Hamas and asks him
*01:59.240- 02:03.960* :  what he was hoping to achieve with this attack. We'll have analysis from our Arab affairs,
*02:03.960- 02:08.000* :  editor and ask a defence and diplomatic expert what happens next.
*02:12.300- 02:17.380* :  More than 30 hours into the worst crisis to face Israel in half a century battles with
*02:17.380- 02:20.840* :  Hamas militants are still underway in the south of the country.
*02:20.860- 02:27.060* :  Israel was taken completely by surprise early on Saturday as fighters stormed out of the Gaza Strip,
*02:27.060- 02:32.380* :  attacking Israeli towns and seizing hostages. Israel responded by launching airstrikes
*02:32.380- 02:37.300* :  on the densely populated Palestinian territory. Hundreds of people on both sides have died,
*02:37.300- 02:42.200* :  while Hamas is thought to have taken dozens of hostages from Israel back into Gaza,
*02:42.740- 02:47.920* :  complicating Israeli plans to wreak vengeance. Richard Hatch is a spokesman for the Israeli defence
*02:47.920- 02:52.520* :  forces. It's the second day of war that Hamas unleashed on the state of Israel,
*02:53.340- 02:59.360* :  specifically on the communities of around the Gaza Strip, multiple communities. As we speak,
*02:59.360- 03:05.780* :  there's still fighting going on. We're dealing slowly with special forces to take care of the
*03:05.780- 03:13.540* :  terrorists that came in hundreds into Israel, butchered, killed, kidnapped, civilians, mainly
*03:13.540- 03:21.220* :  civilians and soldiers. The main firefights are more or less over. We're still dealing with a few
*03:21.220- 03:27.080* :  communities and military locations where there's still firefights as we speak with terrorists.
*03:27.620- 03:34.260* :  Hopefully, as the day goes on, we'll be able to, at first stage, secure the communities around
*03:34.260- 03:40.220* :  the Gaza Strip. Will you negotiate with Hamas for a prisoner swap? Right now, we're focusing
*03:40.380- 03:46.480* :  on the fight. That's what we're in right now. It's a very, very dire situation.
*03:47.140- 03:51.140* :  Slowly, we're doing what we need to do to get the communities back and safe,
*03:51.720- 03:57.580* :  and we are now planning our future severe response on Hamas as a inhumane attack into Israel.
*03:58.220- 04:03.160* :  Hostages right now, and that's probably going on in other channels. Right now, the IDF is focused
*04:03.160- 04:08.260* :  mainly on stabilizing and responding to this terrible attack.
*04:08.940- 04:13.000* :  Israeli defense spokesman Richard Hatch, talking to my colleague, Celia Hatton.
*04:13.580- 04:19.660* :  Joe Floto is the BBC's Jerusalem bureau chief. He told me about Israeli efforts to regain control
*04:19.660- 04:23.460* :  from the Hamas militants. The Israeli military are telling us that they're still carrying out
*04:23.460- 04:31.860* :  mopping up operations in the handful of towns and villages on the border with the Gaza Strip.
*04:31.960- 04:39.160* :  They have taken a long time to clear out militants who streamed across the border yesterday morning.
*04:39.960- 04:45.640* :  And overnight, they managed to release some hostages who've been taken in a dining room of a
*04:45.640- 04:51.260* :  kebuts. That's a small agricultural community. And about 50 of them have been taken by government.
*04:51.260- 04:56.720* :  That was resolved in the early hours of this morning. They're still not 100% sure that the area
*04:56.720- 05:02.240* :  is clear. There's still the possibility that there could be militants hiding away. And we've just
*05:02.240- 05:08.660* :  been told that they have attacked with a drone, a group of militants approaching the border
*05:08.660- 05:14.200* :  fence from Gaza. So that operation isn't over yet. Furthermore, they're telling us that they're
*05:14.200- 05:18.520* :  now starting to evacuate the remaining civilian population. So thousands of people are going to
*05:18.520- 05:23.680* :  be bust out of the area surrounding the Gaza Strip. And that might give us a clue as to the
*05:23.680- 05:27.400* :  intensity of the military operation that might follow in the next few days.
*05:27.900- 05:33.360* :  Now Israel has been hitting Gaza overnight with air strikes. And as you'll know, that is a
*05:33.500- 05:39.220* :  common response from the Israelis. But now they're talking about a severe response to what was
*05:39.220- 05:46.540* :  seen yesterday. What exactly could that mean? Well, we've seen the mobilization of thousands of
*05:46.540- 05:53.300* :  reservists. We've seen them move tens of different battalions into the area currently operating
*05:54.400- 05:59.740* :  to more than two dozen battalions. They are drafting in three divisions. These are thousands of
*05:59.740- 06:04.640* :  soldiers. I mean, it's slightly technical issues, but thousands of soldiers are being moved
*06:04.640- 06:10.160* :  into position, including a good number of tanks and armoured vehicles. And we can only assume
*06:11.000- 06:15.060* :  that that means that they are planning some kind of ground operation. Now the presence of those
*06:15.060- 06:21.280* :  soldiers, those hostages, sorry, will obviously complicate that. But they are determined to
*06:21.280- 06:25.880* :  exact a price for what the Israeli Prime Minister calls a black day yesterday.
*06:26.400- 06:30.720* :  Now in recent months, we've seen an escalation of tensions, particularly in the West Bank,
*06:30.720- 06:37.580* :  as well as attacks in different parts of Israel. But how does the country feel today after what
*06:37.580- 06:44.460* :  happened yesterday? I think the country feels vulnerable and angry and shocked and stunned that such
*06:44.780- 06:52.200* :  military catastrophe could turn into civilian massacres on that scale. This was precisely the
*06:52.200- 06:59.420* :  objective that her mass had signaled longer, which was to bring the violence into Israeli homes
*06:59.420- 07:05.400* :  that was being seen in the West Bank. This was advertised. But we were told that this wasn't
*07:05.980- 07:10.080* :  possible, that the level of fortification, the level of sophistication of the Israeli military
*07:10.120- 07:14.260* :  meant that this couldn't happen. But what we saw yesterday, very clearly were her mass militants
*07:14.880- 07:22.040* :  overrunning Israeli military positions and then going on to enter civilian population areas
*07:22.660- 07:28.080* :  near the Gaza Strip and shoot indiscriminately. There's a bus stop in Sterot where just littered
*07:28.080- 07:33.240* :  with bodies as people waiting for the bus were mone down by the gun when we've seen people shot
*07:33.240- 07:41.260* :  in their homes. We've seen this party that was taking place in the desert. People just mone down
*07:41.760- 07:46.680* :  by militants attacking from two sides. These are unarmed party goes. So I think it's the level of
*07:46.680- 07:53.520* :  savagery that is being commented on at the moment and the disgust at the treatment of these hostages
*07:54.120- 07:59.960* :  is universal. And that's why you're seeing the very divided Israeli political landscape
*07:59.960- 08:05.020* :  unifying very strongly today. And we're likely to see unity government as a result.
*08:05.820- 08:12.340* :  Our Jerusalem bureau chief Joe Floto, one of the party goers Joe was referring to is Gili Yoskovich.
*08:12.720- 08:16.900* :  She was among hundreds of young people that had danced music festival in southern Israel
*08:16.900- 08:22.660* :  near the Gaza Strip when the government attacked. The tour was becoming from four or five places,
*08:22.660- 08:27.360* :  not like one direction. So we didn't know where to go. I got into my car. I drove a little bit
*08:27.560- 08:33.240* :  some people were shooting on me. I left the car. I started to run. I saw a place with many,
*08:33.240- 08:38.740* :  many pomelo trees like 200 trees. So I was going in the middle and I was lying in the floor. It
*08:38.740- 08:43.740* :  was the second hidden that I find and they were just all around me and they were going three by
*08:43.740- 08:52.520* :  three and shooting everywhere from two sides. And I saw many people like dying all around.
*08:53.240- 08:57.200* :  No, it was very quiet. I didn't cry. I didn't do anything. But in one hand I was like
*08:57.200- 09:02.700* :  bruising. I said, okay, I'm going to die. It's okay. Just breathe. Just close your eyes because
*09:02.700- 09:07.940* :  it was shooting everywhere. Very, very close to me. And then I heard the terrorists. I heard
*09:07.940- 09:13.320* :  them. They opened a big van and all the time they got more weapons from this car. They were in
*09:13.320- 09:19.740* :  the area for three hours. No one was there. No one. Policemen from the party. Yes, I saw but
*09:19.800- 09:26.060* :  they were in one side. Other side. I was sure like the army will come. I heard some helicopters.
*09:26.060- 09:31.540* :  I was sure like soldiers are going to come down with robes and going to this field and save
*09:31.540- 09:37.860* :  us. But no one was there. Just all the terrorists. They were very close to me. So my leg was
*09:37.860- 09:43.500* :  starting to, I didn't control myself. It was like this. So I tried and I did my best and move a
*09:43.500- 09:47.520* :  little bit. When they were in this side, I heard them talking Arabic. When they were in this side,
*09:47.520- 09:52.180* :  I moved a bit here. When they were in this side, I moved to the other side and tried to be much
*09:52.180- 09:58.180* :  under the tree. So maybe when the shooting will come, they will not touch my face. I was lying
*09:58.180- 10:02.540* :  there for like three hours. And did you know what happened to your friends? Was she? I was
*10:02.540- 10:07.680* :  true. She was dead. I was just thinking about my kids, about my friend, about everything.
*10:08.360- 10:10.960* :  And I was said, it's not the time to die for me, not yet.
*10:11.720- 10:17.320* :  Gili Yoskiewicz. Local media in Israel are currently reporting that more than 500
*10:17.320- 10:25.520* :  Israelis have been killed over the past 24 hours in those Hamas attacks. In Gaza, Palestinians have
*10:25.520- 10:30.300* :  described desperate conditions. This Israeli air strikes continue to batter the territory.
*10:30.300- 10:35.740* :  Health officials there say more than 300 people have been killed so far. Many of them civilians,
*10:35.740- 10:41.800* :  including children and a pregnant woman. Hospitals in Gaza are overwhelmed as thousands of people
*10:41.800- 10:47.180* :  have been injured. Mahmoud Shalabi is the Gaza director of Medical Aid for Palestinians.
*10:48.120- 10:54.220* :  It's really a grim situation in Gaza. Yesterday, my colleagues were phoning people inside the
*10:54.220- 11:00.240* :  hospital. We found people inside Shifa Hospital, which is the largest trauma hospital in all of
*11:00.240- 11:05.900* :  Palestine. It actually is located in Gaza. It was described as a slaughterhouse. There were
*11:05.900- 11:11.980* :  no spaces. Many people were on the ground in the emergency department. There were many dead
*11:11.980- 11:17.920* :  bodies in the morgue and the medical staff were unable to cope with the huge influx of the
*11:17.920- 11:22.680* :  casualties that they were receiving. Well, for more details about the situation. In Gaza,
*11:22.680- 11:27.060* :  we spoke to our correspondent in the Palestinian territory, Rishdi Abu al-Uluf.
*11:27.340- 11:32.800* :  Fighting has been continued throughout last night and this morning with the Israeli
*11:32.800- 11:39.960* :  Airstrikes targeting menli Hamas infrastructure, Hamas pangs, Hamas military combat, but also
*11:40.540- 11:46.840* :  about 12 houses belonged to Hamas senior leader in Gaza. The death toll according to health
*11:46.840- 11:54.760* :  ministry is 313. In the streets of Gaza, Gaza is like 10 into a ghost town. It's deserted. All
*11:54.760- 12:01.040* :  of the shops are closed. Some of the collapse building because of the Israeli Airstrikes are
*12:01.040- 12:07.480* :  looking at the main roads in downtown. Gaza, I had the chance this morning to drive through this
*12:07.480- 12:14.800* :  area. The scare of destruction is really huge and the debris is closing. Some of the main roads
*12:14.800- 12:21.780* :  around the area. Would people have had time to evacuate from those areas before the Israeli
*12:21.780- 12:28.420* :  Airstrikes hit? Well, Israel has been targeting places for Hamas. We are talking about infrastructure
*12:28.420- 12:35.820* :  installations, banks and within among the cities, we are not talking about like separate
*12:35.820- 12:42.580* :  buildings for Hamas. For example, in downtown Gaza, Israel said that this building is 11 story
*12:42.580- 12:48.100* :  building is used by Hamas as a command center and they have destroyed this building.
*12:48.500- 12:55.160* :  Around it, it's a very densely populated neighborhood. Many of the shops and houses around
*12:55.160- 13:01.620* :  the building will also damage the, I was working in this area this morning. The last
*13:01.620- 13:08.960* :  chatter on the ground, cars were like 10 behind the road and the situation in like especially in
*13:08.960- 13:14.240* :  this downtown Gaza is a bit of a surprise for the people because this area was considered
*13:14.800- 13:20.440* :  for a quite a long time as a safe area. In other locations, the Israeli Army idea of
*13:21.020- 13:26.320* :  warning for people to leave their house and we have seen, we have get reborn from people
*13:26.320- 13:31.960* :  near the border. Many families have left flee their homes and they are taking
*13:32.460- 13:40.820* :  shelters in the UN schools in Gaza. We have seen this before during the last four
*13:40.820- 13:46.700* :  wars that because Hamas and Israel engaged in four wars before and small battles in between.
*13:46.700- 13:52.980* :  So, always people in dangerous area, they flee their homes, they go to the UN school to take
*13:52.980- 13:59.320* :  it as shelter also because Gaza has no like proper shelters for people so they have no other
*13:59.320- 14:06.260* :  option but to leave for more safer area. The sound of exiblusion can easily be heard everywhere
*14:06.260- 14:14.880* :  and Gaza, I can see from my balcony overlooking the downtown, the smoke still in the horizon from
*14:14.880- 14:22.520* :  the collapsed building and the only sound is the ambulances, sounds and the civil defence sounds
*14:22.520- 14:27.020* :  like on the streets rushing to the places that has been hit by Israel.
*14:27.620- 14:34.020* :  The BBC is Rushdie Abu Aluf in Gaza. So, why did Hamas launch this operation now and what did
*14:34.020- 14:38.400* :  it hope to achieve on Middle East analysts is Sebastian Usher? I don't think there is any one
*14:38.400- 14:44.180* :  answer to that. What we've seen over the past couple of decades is that Israel and Hamas
*14:44.540- 14:50.500* :  engage in serious conflict but within certain limits and that limit obviously been bypassed
*14:50.500- 14:54.940* :  and that limit is Hamas entering Israel and taking hostages and killing people there.
*14:55.220- 15:00.100* :  I mean this was never as is the way with red lines made clear but it seems somehow that that
*15:00.100- 15:03.920* :  was the lid that was being kept on it, that has now been broken. So, you have to ask question
*15:03.920- 15:10.960* :  why is Hamas playing what is its ace card essentially from its perspective now because it's going to
*15:10.960- 15:17.420* :  have a huge backlash, obviously militarily, from Israel. Israel each time that these conflicts
*15:17.980- 15:22.140* :  of suddenly erupt says that it's going to degrade Hamas's ability to carry out such attacks.
*15:22.140- 15:27.840* :  Again, it never really succeeds. Hamas manages for a variety of reasons, despite being landlocked,
*15:27.840- 15:33.480* :  despite the blockade on it by Israel, to get weapons to make weapons etc and this extraordinary
*15:33.480- 15:38.200* :  thing this time, that's having its fighters use hang gliders to go in. I mean many people ask
*15:38.200- 15:43.200* :  the question how on earth did they do, is that Iran's help perhaps? I mean Iran definitely
*15:43.200- 15:49.480* :  backs Hamas, there's no doubt about that both financially and militarily but it doesn't 100% pull
*15:49.480- 15:55.040* :  the strings just like with Hasbullah, the connection between Hasbullah and Iran is closer but even
*15:55.040- 15:59.620* :  there Hasbullah has its own objectives and its own lines but it doesn't really want to cross
*15:59.620- 16:05.020* :  as we've seen today, it doesn't essentially want to cross a line that would bring huge retribution
*16:05.020- 16:10.400* :  from Israel across the whole of Lebanon and Hamas has seemed to be in that situation as well.
*16:10.780- 16:15.320* :  Now we've had the Abraham Accords, obviously for several years now and in recent months
*16:15.320- 16:20.140* :  we've had increasingly the sense that Saudi Arabia, which is the one thing that really matters
*16:20.500- 16:25.560* :  in the Middle East, is preparing to do a deal, a normalization deal with Israel, which many people
*16:25.560- 16:30.820* :  like me kind of thought wasn't on the cards for a long time but the kind of planning that was
*16:30.820- 16:35.660* :  needed to put this together predates the buildup, there's been in the past few weeks per sense
*16:35.920- 16:41.840* :  that there really is momentum towards a deal. So I think it can't just be to do that but it certainly
*16:41.840- 16:47.960* :  is a message from Hamas both about its own existence and its own power and the Palestinians in
*16:47.960- 16:52.340* :  general that they can't be left out of the equation and that they have up their sleeve as we're
*16:52.340- 16:57.600* :  now seeing the ability to change the equation to an extent that they can't be neglected just by
*16:57.600- 17:01.780* :  Israel and Israeli governments but also by the wider Middle East, the Arab governments that
*17:01.780- 17:07.200* :  used to say that Palestine was at the center of Arab identity and the move away from that.
*17:07.200- 17:12.460* :  That can be seen as a huge gesture by Hamas of saying you cannot leave us out of this.
*17:12.700- 17:16.980* :  Changing the equation in a big way by taking those hostages, where's this going to play out?
*17:17.180- 17:21.520* :  It took years of negotiations to get that soldier Gilad Shilit back and that was in return for
*17:21.860- 17:26.440* :  something like a thousand jail Palestinians. Absolutely and that was deeply unpopular within
*17:26.440- 17:31.900* :  Israel. There's a saga in Lebanon of a soldier who died many many years ago and that is still a
*17:31.900- 17:36.660* :  major issue. So imagine we don't know how many hostages have been taken. We don't know how many
*17:36.660- 17:42.360* :  soldiers, how many are civilians but we know it's at least dozens. This is a hugely complicating
*17:42.360- 17:48.520* :  fact to both in the way of trying to de-escalate the situation but how Israel actually reacts. We've
*17:48.520- 17:53.940* :  heard how the troops are building up at the border. We're expecting a ground offensive. As far as
*17:53.940- 18:00.300* :  one can understand from Hamas's perspective, they are using the hostages exactly as you say as a
*18:00.300- 18:06.360* :  way to get the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. As you said in past
*18:06.520- 18:11.760* :  incidents like that, it's taken years to get to that stage. I think there's a huge urgency about
*18:11.800- 18:18.860* :  this but at the same time the Israeli public isn't going to accept that exchange for the prisoners
*18:19.520- 18:23.640* :  essentially so that Hamas has achieved its objectives but absolutely the heart of the way that it
*18:23.640- 18:27.440* :  sees itself is that it doesn't allow one of its citizens, whether a civilian or a soldier,
*18:27.440- 18:31.420* :  to be in the hands of an enemy, they will bring them back whatever way that they can.
*18:31.940- 18:37.340* :  On Middle East analyst Sebastian Asha, well for more detailed analysis of the devastating actions
*18:37.340- 18:44.080* :  by Hamas, my colleague Tim Franks questioned Osama Hamdan, a senior representative of Hamas based
*18:44.080- 18:52.340* :  in the Lebanese capital Beirut. Israel has attacked harshly al-Aqsa mosque and Jerusalem in the
*18:52.340- 19:01.540* :  last few weeks. With this new government led by Netanyahu, all the political actions couldn't
*19:01.540- 19:09.500* :  protect al-Aqsa and as far as we have information that they are going to take over part of al-Aqsa to
*19:09.660- 19:16.740* :  build what they call the Temple of Cinnamon, which is a very clear red line for the Palestinians
*19:16.740- 19:22.700* :  not only Hamas. The second issue which they conducted, building new settlements,
*19:23.520- 19:29.840* :  planning to kick out the Palestinians from West Bank and to ask clear that there is no political
*19:29.840- 19:37.780* :  solution with Israelis. The third point which is also important, the talks about some normalization
*19:37.900- 19:44.600* :  with the region, which means that they want to say finally there is no Palestinian cause,
*19:45.300- 19:52.420* :  there is some people who are against the Israeli government and all the region have good relations
*19:52.420- 19:57.680* :  with Israel, which is not true in fact. So just to be clear on this to Hamdan, this was a message
*19:57.680- 20:05.460* :  as much as any to, for example, the rulers of Saudi Arabia that they should not engage in
*20:05.460- 20:11.360* :  reproach on with Israel. No, it's not a message for anyone except for the Israeli government.
*20:12.140- 20:18.760* :  The Palestinians are still standing, they are fighting for their rights and for the international
*20:18.760- 20:27.660* :  community. You have to understand that you can't treat Israel as a spoiled child. You have to know
*20:28.340- 20:34.580* :  that the instability in the region because of Israel, the presence of Israel as a dupuraya
*20:35.160- 20:42.460* :  and a solution has to start from implementing the rights of the Palestinians, not the needs of Israel.
*20:42.940- 20:49.340* :  I hear what you are saying that there is concern about what's happening with Al-Aqsa Mosque
*20:49.420- 20:55.300* :  in Jerusalem on the West Bank and that you think the Israelis have been ignoring Palestinians
*20:55.300- 21:01.380* :  with their push for normalization with countries in the region. All that having been said,
*21:02.280- 21:08.640* :  how on earth do you think that the cause of the Palestinians has been advanced
*21:09.720- 21:19.080* :  by the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Israel and then what is bound to be the very heavy
*21:19.080- 21:27.400* :  response of Israel inside Gaza with the tremendous loss of life that that will inevitably entail?
*21:28.040- 21:36.100* :  When our people are used for the Israeli massacres, all the time Israel was killing the Palestinians
*21:36.100- 21:42.940* :  and the international community was just watching and West Bank this year was the worst.
*21:43.840- 21:47.540* :  We are talking about hundreds of Palestinians who were killed by the Israelis.
*21:48.520- 21:53.580* :  What have been sent yesterday for the all the international community,
*21:54.420- 21:59.340* :  no stability if the Israeli occupation is still on the Palestinian lands.
*22:00.460- 22:06.640* :  If you want and we want the Palestinians stability in the region, you have to make an
*22:06.640- 22:13.380* :  end for the occupation. Osama Hamdan, a senior leader of Hamas in the Lebanese capital Beirut,
*22:13.760- 22:18.200* :  talking to Tim Franks. Well Israel has called its response to the assault
*22:18.200- 22:23.600* :  sword of iron, but what do these attacks mean for the country and its aura of military
*22:23.600- 22:28.760* :  invincibility in the region? I asked the Defence and Diplomatic Analyst Jonathan Marcus for his take.
*22:29.060- 22:33.600* :  I think they have shattered not just perceptions of Israeli military power in the region,
*22:33.600- 22:40.660* :  but many of Israel's own citizens perception of the Israeli Defence Force's ability to protect them.
*22:41.100- 22:47.680* :  I think the dangers are of course now that if this war extends into a major military
*22:47.680- 22:54.140* :  incursion on the ground into the Gaza Strip, clearly there will be huge civilian casualties there.
*22:54.140- 23:01.260* :  There are already numerous civilian casualties from the airborne bombardment, but equally too,
*23:01.260- 23:06.580* :  there will be significant Israeli military casualties. We've seen this in previous Israeli
*23:06.580- 23:13.620* :  incursions fighting in the built-up area of Gaza is very difficult, very dangerous and is going
*23:13.620- 23:19.820* :  to lead to significant losses, but I think the scale of the initial setback for Israel and the
*23:19.820- 23:26.160* :  scale of the setback to the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Netanyahu I think means that there is now
*23:26.160- 23:32.060* :  going to be a significant military operation that may last for some considerable time.
*23:32.420- 23:38.280* :  Yeah, I mean some people are talking about this as a 9-11 moment for Israel, 9-11 strengthen the
*23:38.280- 23:43.960* :  US president at the time. Ultimately, what could this mean for Israeli politics going forward?
*23:44.600- 23:48.940* :  Well, I think it's a 9-11 moment in terms of the shock to the system. Of course, many people
*23:48.940- 23:55.320* :  might argue that the Americans overreacted to 9-11 and set in train a whole series of wars,
*23:55.320- 23:59.980* :  which they ultimately didn't win. So I don't think it's quite like that in that sense. I think in
*23:59.980- 24:06.220* :  terms of the impact in Israel itself, it's like that. I think, look, initially there is going to be a
*24:06.220- 24:13.420* :  massive unity around prosecuting this struggle, the shock, as I say, with the numerous casualties and
*24:13.760- 24:20.800* :  youngsters and women and children and grandmothers abducted by Hamas government. That's going to be
*24:21.180- 24:28.340* :  a huge shock to the system. But remember, for a year or more prior to this war, Israeli society has
*24:28.340- 24:34.800* :  been deeply divided. The Prime Minister has taken on ever more extreme political allies on the
*24:34.800- 24:40.580* :  right wing. Millions of Israelis have been out in the street demonstrating against that many of
*24:40.580- 24:46.100* :  his proposed reforms, which have been seen as anti-democratic and so on. So I think when the
*24:46.100- 24:51.020* :  dust settles eventually, when this war is over, there is going to be a huge political reckoning,
*24:51.500- 24:56.780* :  and it isn't just going to be blaming the military or the intelligence services for failures,
*24:56.780- 25:03.320* :  and there were clearly failures and lapses. But I think a lot of it is going to come back to Mr Netanyahu's
*25:03.820- 25:09.300* :  What about efforts to end the crisis? You and Security Council meeting later, there's also
*25:09.300- 25:15.200* :  calls for an emergency Arab League meeting. I'm sure we will see all the panoply of diplomatic
*25:15.260- 25:22.220* :  meetings that you would expect to see in such circumstances. But I think given the scale of the
*25:22.220- 25:28.920* :  casualties so far, given that Israel's perceived need to reestablish some kind of deterrence,
*25:29.200- 25:34.460* :  we are not going to see a rapid end to this crisis. And it's all complicated, of course,
*25:34.460- 25:39.780* :  by the large number of hostages that the Hamas government have taken back to Gaza.
*25:40.400- 25:42.420* :  Defense and diplomatic analyst Jonathan Marcus.
*25:44.860- 25:48.320* :  And that is all from us for now. The Global News Podcast will be back very soon.

*26:13.920- 26:17.200* :  I was overwhelmed. Like, I had never seen anything like this.
*26:17.420- 26:20.140* :  At the height of Abercrombian fits his success.
*26:20.340- 26:22.780* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.
*26:23.060- 26:25.980* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity.
*26:26.320- 26:32.000* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money, sex and power.
*26:33.000- 26:37.700* :  This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie Guys.
