*00:54.540- 00:58.560* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:00.780- 01:05.640* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Thursday the 19th of October these are our main
*01:05.640- 01:11.400* :  stories. Both Israel and Egypt have agreed that limited aid of food, water and medicine can
*01:11.400- 01:16.900* :  enter Gaza after this request from President Biden on his whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv.
*01:17.120- 01:21.640* :  Today I ask the Israeli Cabinet to agree to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance
*01:21.640- 01:27.640* :  to civilians in Gaza. There will be inspections that the aid should go to civilians, not to a mass.
*01:28.400- 01:34.520* :  Mr. Biden also said he's seen information indicating the explosion at a hospital in Gaza had been
*01:34.520- 01:40.800* :  caused by an Islamist terror group. We examine what we know about the blast that's killed hundreds of
*01:40.800- 01:49.520* :  people. Also in this podcast Republican Congressman Jim Jordan has failed again to gather enough
*01:49.520- 01:55.880* :  support to become Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. This candidate does not and will not
*01:55.880- 02:01.680* :  be able to get the Republican votes to become Speaker. So then now I think all of us have to get
*02:01.680- 02:07.040* :  together and figure out what's the next step. And Japan's government unveils measures to counter
*02:07.040- 02:11.280* :  over tourism at famous sites, including Mount Fuji.
*02:14.940- 02:19.920* :  President Biden says the United States will stand beside Israel through the dark days,
*02:19.920- 02:25.620* :  but has also warned that it must make an honest assessment about the path it's on and whether
*02:25.620- 02:31.140* :  it will achieve its aims. Mr. Biden was speaking during a brief visit to Tel Aviv, which has been
*02:31.140- 02:36.260* :  overshadowed by the death of hundreds of people in an explosion at a hospital in Gaza.
*02:36.540- 02:41.800* :  The President also called for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Gaza. On the condition,
*02:41.800- 02:47.560* :  it doesn't end up in the wrong hands. If a mosque diverts or steals the assistance,
*02:48.040- 02:52.240* :  they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian
*02:52.240- 02:56.120* :  people. We're working in close cooperation with the government of Egypt, the United Nations,
*02:56.120- 03:00.600* :  and the agencies like the World Program and other partners in the region to get trucks moving
*03:00.600- 03:06.900* :  across the border as soon as possible. Separately, I ask Israel that the global community and man
*03:06.900- 03:11.520* :  that the international Red Cross be able to visit hostages. Today, I'm also announcing
*03:11.520- 03:17.900* :  $100 million of new U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank.
*03:18.160- 03:22.080* :  This funding will support more than 1 million displaced and conflict-effective Palestinian
*03:22.080- 03:29.240* :  including emergency needs in Gaza. Mr. Biden has now left the region after Palestinian and Arab
*03:29.240- 03:34.100* :  leaders canceled meetings with him, following the blast at the hospital in Gaza.
*03:34.460- 03:40.200* :  President Biden said the U.S. mourned the loss of Palestinian lives, but also said the world
*03:40.200- 03:46.220* :  could not stand by after the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October, which killed more than
*03:46.220- 03:52.600* :  1,300 Israelis. For decades, we've ensured Israel's qualitative military edge.
*03:52.940- 03:57.080* :  And later this week, I'm going to ask the United States Congress for unprecedented support
*03:57.080- 04:03.060* :  package for Israel's defense. We're going to keep ironed down fully supplied so it can continue
*04:03.060- 04:09.160* :  standing sentinel over Israeli skies saving Israeli lives. We've moved U.S. military assets
*04:09.160- 04:14.300* :  to the region, including positioning the U.S.S. Ford Carrier Strike Group in Eastern Mediterranean,
*04:15.100- 04:20.940* :  with the U.S.S. size an hour on the way to defer further aggression against Israel and to prevent
*04:20.940- 04:25.580* :  this conflict from spreading. And my message to any state or any other hospital actor,
*04:25.900- 04:31.620* :  thinking about attacking Israel, amazed the same as it was a week ago. Don't, don't, don't.
*04:32.420- 04:38.680* :  Both Egypt and Israel have agreed to food, water and medicine going into Gaza. A correspondent
*04:38.680- 04:44.220* :  where a Davis in Jerusalem told me about the significance of getting Egypt's border crossing
*04:44.220- 04:48.980* :  open for humanitarian purposes. This is a big breakthrough for those the
*04:48.980- 04:53.580* :  United Nations like aid agencies who've been increasingly concerned about the humanitarian
*04:53.580- 05:00.240* :  situation in Gaza. The far Israel's policy had been that no aid at all would get into Gaza
*05:00.240- 05:06.760* :  either through the Israeli borders or via the southern border with Egypt at RAFA until those
*05:06.760- 05:14.400* :  199 hostages being detained by Hamas were released. But the president, he almost demanded this
*05:14.660- 05:20.020* :  of Israel that it had to open and allow some sort of aid through because for Israel on one hand
*05:20.020- 05:26.080* :  to demand that over a million Palestinians leave their homes in northern Gaza from those areas
*05:26.080- 05:31.420* :  where the Israeli Air Force was targeting but to have nothing to go to in the south of Gaza
*05:31.880- 05:36.240* :  and to be involved in that dire humanitarian situation that is clearly unacceptable to the
*05:36.240- 05:41.340* :  international community. And President Biden made it clear to the Israelis today, not only did he
*05:41.560- 05:47.280* :  meet Benjamin Netanyahu but he met the Israeli war cabinet and he made that demand to the Israeli
*05:47.340- 05:54.080* :  war cabinet and Israel conceded that it now would allow limited humanitarian aid through
*05:54.720- 05:59.820* :  the RAFA crossing with the agreement of Egypt on account that none of it makes its way to the
*05:59.880- 06:05.740* :  Hamas militant group. Well you mentioned the Israeli hostages and of course more than 30 of them
*06:06.400- 06:11.940* :  are American or at least hold American passport. Yeah this is a massive concern for Israelis as well.
*06:11.940- 06:17.580* :  Other internationals are on that list of 199 people thought to have been abducted by
*06:17.580- 06:22.720* :  Hamas and health hostages inside the Gaza Strip that very little news has come out about their
*06:22.720- 06:28.480* :  condition and there are protests daily in Israel. People concerned that Israel's stated intention
*06:28.480- 06:34.180* :  of going into Gaza to defeat and destroy Hamas may of course have consequences for the hostages
*06:34.720- 06:39.460* :  and Joe Biden made it clear today he said without going into specifics because it was a delicate
*06:39.460- 06:45.140* :  matter that he had brought that issue up and getting the hostages release was a prime concern to him.
*06:45.260- 06:51.360* :  This is the first time a US president has visited the country during a war. Did he achieve
*06:51.360- 06:55.940* :  his aim do you think during this visit? I think so and this is mindful of the fact of course
*06:56.480- 07:03.660* :  the events in that hospital in Gaza City which was hit in an attack in which hundreds of people
*07:03.660- 07:08.460* :  have thought to have been killed. That was threatening to overshadow the visit that had a knock-on
*07:08.460- 07:13.020* :  effect in that the Arab leaders who Joe Biden was meant to meet on a second leg of this trip
*07:13.620- 07:18.880* :  pulled out of that meeting so the expectations were quite low when Joe Biden arrived in Israel.
*07:19.360- 07:23.800* :  It was a very short visit less than half a day long but I think with those concessions with those
*07:23.800- 07:31.540* :  points he made in his speech he did make some ground. We're a Davis in Jerusalem. Well as we reported
*07:31.540- 07:37.080* :  earlier President Biden also said that based on the information he'd seen Tuesday's explosion at
*07:37.080- 07:43.420* :  the Ali Hospital in Gaza had been caused by an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.
*07:43.420- 07:49.980* :  Israel says the device had been fired by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group Hamas then blamed
*07:49.980- 07:55.400* :  an Israeli air strike. Rear Admiral Daniel Haggari who's a spokesman for the Israeli defense
*07:55.400- 08:01.960* :  forces set out what they believe had happened. It was at the time that 6.59 pm when there were
*08:01.960- 08:09.080* :  reports of an explosion at the Al-Halil Mahdani Hospital in Gaza City. According to our
*08:09.080- 08:16.260* :  intelligence Hamas checked the reports understood it was an Islamic Jihad rocket that had misfired
*08:16.620- 08:21.920* :  and decided to launch a global media campaign to hide what really happened.
*08:22.940- 08:29.560* :  Palestinian Islamic Jihad says the accusations are false and baseless adding it doesn't use hospitals
*08:29.560- 08:35.800* :  for its forces. Dr. Bassim Naim who's a spokesman for Hamas told the BBC that the group
*08:35.800- 08:40.760* :  could not have been behind the explosion. We don't have the facility or the capability
*08:40.780- 08:48.920* :  for such as a huge and aggressive attack we are ready to invite an international
*08:48.940- 08:55.460* :  investigation committee to investigate the situation in the ground but with one guarantee
*08:55.460- 09:01.160* :  that if any side is responsible he should also be brought to accountability.
*09:01.760- 09:07.200* :  With access to the site of the explosion that the hospital in Gaza limited, BBC Verify has been
*09:07.200- 09:12.900* :  studying footage of the moments just before the blast. Caroline Holley has been investigating
*09:12.900- 09:20.920* :  what we know so far. Video footage records chaos at a lathley hospital after the explosion
*09:20.940- 09:27.020* :  at a huge fireball. With the Gaza Strip cut off from the world, experts including BBC
*09:27.020- 09:31.020* :  Verification teams have been pouring over all the images that have emerged from the scene
*09:31.580- 09:35.340* :  to try to establish the cause of the explosion that's claimed so many lives.
*09:39.160- 09:43.260* :  Israeli Army released what it said was an intercepted conversation between two Hamas
*09:43.260- 09:48.880* :  operatives discussing the strike and saying it appeared to be a missile misfired by Islamic Jihad.
*09:49.560- 09:55.160* :  It's not possible to independently verify the recording but the BBC has verified images from
*09:55.160- 10:00.360* :  the scene this morning that appear to show a relatively small crater inside the hospital courtyard.
*10:01.220- 10:05.340* :  You can see abandoned clothes and mattresses on a patch of grass where many
*10:05.340- 10:09.880* :  garsons seem to have been sleeping as they sheltered from the Israeli bombardment of the past few days.
*10:10.880- 10:15.540* :  There's limited structural damage to hospital buildings and some weapons experts consulted
*10:15.540- 10:20.700* :  by the BBC say that a typical Israeli air strike would cause a larger crater and greater
*10:20.700- 10:26.180* :  damage and suggest that the fire could have been started by rocket fuel. But Kim Hughes,
*10:26.180- 10:31.100* :  a former bomb disposal officer who served in Afghanistan in Iraq, says that to really know what
*10:31.100- 10:35.960* :  happened, it's critical to get to the site itself. There is evidence of a high explosive event,
*10:35.960- 10:41.980* :  so something has occurred there. What that may be, we don't know whether it was a projectile,
*10:41.980- 10:47.800* :  a free flight rocket, guided system, an explosive device in a car. Until you get on the ground and
*10:47.800- 10:51.420* :  do a post blast analysis, you're not going to know essentially what has occurred.
*10:51.580- 10:55.420* :  Amnesty International says the International Criminal Court need to be allowed access
*10:55.420- 11:01.300* :  to conduct an urgent and independent investigation of what it called a terrible crime.
*11:01.840- 11:07.060* :  Caroline Holley, the hospital explosion has sparked widespread regional outrage.
*11:07.060- 11:12.660* :  There were sporadic clashes between protesters and security forces in the occupied West Bank.
*11:12.660- 11:17.440* :  In Lebanon, tear gas was deployed to break up demonstrators near the US Embassy.
*11:17.440- 11:22.680* :  There have been similar scenes in Tunisia and Turkey with many condemning Western countries
*11:22.680- 11:28.180* :  for their support of Israel. A correspondent Andrew Harding went to a pro-Palestinian rally
*11:28.520- 11:32.300* :  outside the Israeli Embassy in the Jordanian capital Amman.
*11:33.340- 11:39.160* :  The big crowds, several thousand strong, has gathered here outside the Israeli Embassy.
*11:39.700- 11:41.060* :  They're waving Palestinian flags.
*11:44.400- 11:46.400* :  They bombed the hospital. Can you imagine that?
*11:46.600- 11:50.140* :  They're saying they didn't bomble at all that it was actually a Palestinian rocket.
*11:50.320- 11:51.200* :  It is a lie.
*11:51.540- 11:53.820* :  So you could not trust anything the Israeli said now?
*11:54.340- 11:57.020* :  No, no. We saw something and they said otherwise.
*11:57.020- 12:00.580* :  So they are liars. If I lie to you, will you trust me again?
*12:01.140- 12:06.640* :  And what do you think of the way the West is reacting to the outrageous committees in Israel
*12:06.640- 12:10.380* :  and then the subsequent attacks by Israel in Gaza?
*12:10.380- 12:12.840* :  Palestinians and Gazans are the victim.
*12:13.300- 12:14.700* :  The Israeli are the attackers.
*12:14.700- 12:21.880* :  You can't blame someone who's present in Gaza for years for trying to take the country bad.
*12:22.420- 12:23.060* :  My name is Bilal.
*12:23.440- 12:24.300* :  You know, how old are you?
*12:24.300- 12:25.120* :  Yes, 24.
*12:25.380- 12:26.220* :  Why are you here today?
*12:26.760- 12:28.360* :  Support Palestine, my original country?
*12:28.940- 12:31.820* :  So you like many people here, like more than 2 million people
*12:31.820- 12:34.380* :  are originally Palestinians, refugees?
*12:34.380- 12:35.840* :  Yes, we are one people.
*12:35.980- 12:39.840* :  Did you hope that if President Biden had come in here for a summit,
*12:39.840- 12:41.200* :  that that might have changed things?
*12:41.440- 12:42.100* :  No, not really.
*12:42.100- 12:44.360* :  He announced his support to Israel.
*12:44.920- 12:46.500* :  I don't care about him if he come here or not.
*12:46.640- 12:49.220* :  What do you think happens next here and in Gaza?
*12:49.220- 12:50.100* :  Where is this going?
*12:50.640- 12:51.700* :  They bombed a hospital.
*12:52.300- 12:53.580* :  Well, you know that's disputed.
*12:53.580- 12:55.860* :  We've heard different accounts about that.
*12:56.000- 13:00.820* :  There's some evidence that suggests it could have been a rocket fired from within Gaza.
*13:01.120- 13:01.820* :  That's natural.
*13:02.180- 13:07.800* :  It seems to me there is no way that people here would be prepared to believe anything that Israel said about that.
*13:07.960- 13:08.780* :  Yes, of course.
*13:09.200- 13:09.800* :  There's no trust.
*13:10.260- 13:10.860* :  Not just here.
*13:11.040- 13:16.200* :  In every Arab country, 22 country, we all don't believe anything Israel's.
*13:16.340- 13:18.580* :  There's a 16-year-old girl here.
*13:18.580- 13:21.880* :  It doesn't want to give her name or surname, but is willing to talk.
*13:22.180- 13:24.700* :  Were you hoping that President Biden might come here
*13:24.700- 13:28.740* :  and that he might have some ability to change the situation in Gaza?
*13:28.980- 13:32.260* :  We've all been hoping that we can change the situation,
*13:32.320- 13:35.000* :  whether it's President Biden or any other person.
*13:35.000- 13:38.340* :  We've been hoping that they can get the humanitarian help that they need.
*13:38.680- 13:40.220* :  What about outside Gaza?
*13:40.220- 13:42.740* :  Here in Jordan, in Lebanon and elsewhere?
*13:42.740- 13:48.380* :  Do you think that this is a moment of greater risk for the region?
*13:48.900- 13:49.460* :  Yes, of course.
*13:50.060- 13:52.120* :  Our schools have been stopped today.
*13:52.500- 13:54.000* :  People are not going to work.
*13:54.020- 13:56.140* :  They're not going to get their living.
*13:56.140- 13:58.940* :  So obviously it's going to start another conflict in the region,
*13:59.000- 14:01.540* :  whether it's here in Jordan or in other Middle East countries.
*14:02.200- 14:05.440* :  So that gives you a sense of the mood here in Aman,
*14:05.580- 14:10.220* :  a country with a huge number of Palestinian refugees.
*14:10.220- 14:16.000* :  And where there is, it seems very little appetite to believe a word
*14:16.580- 14:19.660* :  that Israel is saying about what's been happening in Gaza.
*14:20.980- 14:22.620* :  Andrew Harding in Jordan.
*14:23.980- 14:27.280* :  Let's get a bit more now on the prospect of the border with Egypt
*14:27.280- 14:30.160* :  opening. After President Sisi said he will allow
*14:30.160- 14:33.120* :  about 28 trucks to cross into Gaza.
*14:33.700- 14:36.280* :  President Biden said the trucks will be allowed to enter
*14:36.880- 14:38.860* :  even if an Israeli offensive is ongoing.
*14:38.940- 14:43.280* :  His only precondition is that it should not be diverted to Hamas.
*14:43.920- 14:46.400* :  I spoke to our Middle East editor, Sebastian Asher,
*14:46.680- 14:49.000* :  just before President Sisi's announcement.
*14:49.700- 14:51.780* :  What Egypt has been saying over the past few days,
*14:51.780- 14:57.440* :  as hundreds of lorries with supplies urgently needed in Gaza have been piling up
*14:57.460- 14:59.320* :  on the Egyptian border waiting to go through,
*14:59.660- 15:02.620* :  they're saying that it's inoperable because of
*15:02.900- 15:06.640* :  estrikes by Israel and they even accused Israel of placing concrete blocks there.
*15:06.640- 15:11.960* :  So Egypt essentially took the position of we want this humanitarian to go in.
*15:11.960- 15:15.000* :  We want there to be a safe haven inside Gaza,
*15:15.460- 15:17.760* :  where people will have the food, they'll have the fuel,
*15:17.860- 15:19.900* :  they'll have the water, and most importantly,
*15:19.900- 15:22.280* :  some will have the shelter with tents but will go in.
*15:22.540- 15:24.400* :  That's what the foreign minister has been saying.
*15:24.880- 15:28.820* :  And essentially the idea that there'll be a huge exodus
*15:29.300- 15:33.440* :  of Palestinians coming out, Egypt is completely against that for a number of reasons.
*15:33.440- 15:38.180* :  So what President Biden succeeded in doing, and I think to be honest,
*15:38.180- 15:40.900* :  I mean, yes, this was a positive step,
*15:40.940- 15:44.680* :  but I think it's the very least that he could have achieved during this trip.
*15:44.680- 15:48.040* :  He had to have something to show beyond the solidarity that he showed
*15:48.040- 15:51.180* :  very movingly with the Israeli people, and he did do it very well,
*15:51.380- 15:52.360* :  but he had to have something positive.
*15:52.360- 15:53.760* :  So he pulled this out of the bag.
*15:54.120- 15:56.320* :  The Israelis essentially have accepted it,
*15:56.440- 15:58.020* :  but we don't know when the trucks are going to start,
*15:58.020- 16:01.780* :  and every single day matters, every single hour matters for the Palestinians.
*16:02.440- 16:06.340* :  Do you think President Biden will have changed minds in the Arab world
*16:06.340- 16:08.580* :  about what happened at that hospital?
*16:08.880- 16:11.140* :  No, is the simple answer absolutely not.
*16:11.260- 16:13.140* :  I mean, essentially, the minds are already made up
*16:13.200- 16:15.740* :  because of what they see as the history of the conflict
*16:15.740- 16:17.220* :  between the Palestinians and Israel.
*16:17.640- 16:19.380* :  They see Israel always as the aggressors,
*16:19.380- 16:22.580* :  even when Israel essentially presents itself and sees itself
*16:22.580- 16:25.540* :  and is seen by much of a world as striking back after being hit.
*16:26.200- 16:29.820* :  This inflamed the protest that already were far further,
*16:29.820- 16:34.940* :  and this is not just a threat to the way the US wants to ease tensions.
*16:34.940- 16:37.920* :  It's a threat to Arab states,
*16:38.060- 16:40.060* :  but have been moving closer and closer to Israel,
*16:40.060- 16:41.900* :  but once you've signed the Abraham Accords,
*16:42.400- 16:43.800* :  the two countries each in Jordan,
*16:43.800- 16:46.020* :  which have historic peace deals and Saudi Arabia
*16:46.020- 16:47.220* :  which are moving towards that as well.
*16:47.560- 16:50.640* :  They now have to reckon once again with the voices on the street,
*16:50.700- 16:53.420* :  and they want to control that because what they don't want to have happen
*16:53.760- 16:55.380* :  is protest that go beyond their control,
*16:55.420- 16:59.120* :  and might turn, as we've seen in the occupied West Bank
*16:59.120- 17:01.320* :  against them as well as against Israel.
*17:01.920- 17:04.380* :  So what are the dangers of escalation now?
*17:04.720- 17:07.600* :  Do you think, I mean, do we know if a ground offensive
*17:07.840- 17:10.340* :  by the Israelis is actually now going to take place?
*17:11.080- 17:13.540* :  We don't know because the Israelis haven't told us,
*17:13.560- 17:14.820* :  but all the preparation is there.
*17:14.820- 17:18.400* :  And what might have changed that from the Israeli perspective
*17:18.400- 17:21.900* :  was if this had been a slam dunk and proof that Israel had done it,
*17:22.100- 17:24.960* :  that might have begun to seep away some of the support
*17:25.500- 17:27.000* :  of the international community, the West,
*17:27.280- 17:29.420* :  that it's received, which might then make it think twice
*17:29.420- 17:31.580* :  about going in on the foreground offensive.
*17:31.600- 17:32.980* :  So that hasn't really happened.
*17:32.980- 17:34.320* :  President Biden, as we saw,
*17:35.100- 17:36.900* :  backed the Israeli version of events.
*17:37.320- 17:39.600* :  So I don't think those dimensions have changed that much,
*17:40.380- 17:43.080* :  but we're going to see more and more pressure from Arab states
*17:43.080- 17:47.520* :  as their people speak to try and get the International Community to act
*17:47.520- 17:51.000* :  and to prevent what they see as potential carnage in Gaza.
*17:51.700- 17:56.600* :  Sebastian Asher, here's Jackie with some news about another special edition
*17:56.600- 17:58.500* :  of the Global News Podcast.
*17:59.060- 18:01.020* :  You might have heard the special edition we recorded,
*18:01.020- 18:04.340* :  answering listeners questions on events in Israel and Gaza
*18:04.740- 18:06.500* :  and international reaction to them.
*18:06.980- 18:10.220* :  A lot of you have since been in touch to ask us to do it again,
*18:10.780- 18:11.320* :  so we will.
*18:11.880- 18:14.340* :  Send us your questions, anything you want explained,
*18:14.340- 18:18.660* :  and our correspondence will endeavor to provide context and clarity.
*18:19.220- 18:22.080* :  Please record us a voice message or simply write your question
*18:22.080- 18:27.680* :  and email it to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*18:28.440- 18:28.780* :  Thank you.
*18:32.060- 18:35.380* :  In Washington, the Hardline Republican Congressman Jim Jordan
*18:35.380- 18:39.160* :  has again failed to win enough support from his own party
*18:39.560- 18:42.700* :  to be elected as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.
*18:43.500- 18:47.480* :  Mario Diaz-Balat is one of the Republicans who refused to vote for him.
*18:47.880- 18:51.020* :  This candidate does not and will not be able to get
*18:51.820- 18:53.720* :  the Republican votes to become speaker,
*18:54.320- 18:58.220* :  so then now I think all of us have to get together and figure out what's the next step.
*18:58.880- 19:01.460* :  Another vote won't take place before thirsty.
*19:01.460- 19:05.100* :  An author America correspondent Nomeh Iqbal told us more.
*19:05.660- 19:09.100* :  Well, to put it quite bluntly, Republicans, House Republicans are in chaos.
*19:09.340- 19:12.000* :  So Jim Jordan, he did a lot of heavy lobbying yesterday
*19:12.520- 19:15.600* :  and actually he got more Republicans turning against him than four.
*19:15.600- 19:19.640* :  So yesterday he got 20 Republicans votes against him
*19:19.980- 19:22.000* :  and today the numbers increased to 22,
*19:22.000- 19:25.140* :  so that means he's not met that threshold to carry a majority.
*19:25.460- 19:30.200* :  And he earlier was saying he wasn't sure whether he'd proceed to a third round of voting,
*19:30.200- 19:32.080* :  but he has now said that he will.
*19:32.680- 19:34.800* :  And so Congress is in recess at the moment,
*19:34.800- 19:38.320* :  so they can theoretically keep going at this for some time.
*19:38.320- 19:42.660* :  But it does obviously affect hugely what's happening
*19:42.700- 19:44.620* :  because because Congress is in disarray,
*19:44.620- 19:47.020* :  it means lots of crucial issues can't be voted on.
*19:47.220- 19:49.300* :  He's bombastic, he's confrontational.
*19:49.800- 19:52.500* :  Like the man who has endorsed him, Donald Trump,
*19:52.540- 19:56.380* :  the loss of Republicans are really angry about the way things are going.
*19:56.380- 19:59.520* :  So there are some more centrist Republicans who will never vote for him
*19:59.520- 20:01.920* :  because they don't think that someone as conservative as him
*20:01.920- 20:03.840* :  should be the face of the House Republicans.
*20:03.840- 20:07.840* :  You've got those that are furious, Kevin McCarthy was forced out two weeks ago.
*20:07.840- 20:11.460* :  You've got those who are angry, Steve Scalice's bid for the gavel went nowhere.
*20:12.000- 20:16.320* :  And then you have some who are accusing Jim Jordan's supporters of aggressive tactics.
*20:16.320- 20:19.940* :  They say they have been intimidated or threatened
*20:19.940- 20:21.800* :  because they refuse to vote for him.
*20:23.020- 20:26.840* :  Interestingly, I'm now hearing and the reports are being heard
*20:26.840- 20:31.000* :  that all roads point to the interim speaker at the moment,
*20:31.520- 20:32.380* :  Patrick McKenry.
*20:32.780- 20:34.440* :  He is just standing in for the moment,
*20:34.440- 20:37.080* :  but there could be moves to elevate him.
*20:37.080- 20:41.340* :  There are suggestions that he could become House Speaker for a bit longer
*20:41.620- 20:43.920* :  and Democrats might even vote for him.
*20:44.260- 20:46.420* :  For Democrats, I think it's a good move.
*20:46.420- 20:48.440* :  It makes them look like they are saving the day,
*20:48.440- 20:50.640* :  but also it means they can extract some concessions
*20:50.640- 20:52.380* :  if they do indeed say they'll vote for him.
*20:52.880- 20:56.640* :  Nomea Ikbal, a Canadian woman has spoken for the first time
*20:56.640- 21:00.860* :  about her marriage to one of the Islamic state militants known as the Beatles,
*21:00.860- 21:05.600* :  a murderous ISL, and her time living with him in Syria.
*21:06.200- 21:09.180* :  Your Ahmed claims she was oblivious to what was going on
*21:09.480- 21:11.600* :  when it came to the atrocities being committed
*21:11.980- 21:14.900* :  by her then-husband, L. Chaffee L. Shaikh.
*21:15.560- 21:17.660* :  Put him to nature, interview Durhamid,
*21:17.880- 21:20.160* :  as part of the podcast series Bloodlines
*21:20.160- 21:22.560* :  which is produced jointly by the BBC
*21:22.560- 21:26.060* :  and the Canadian Broadcaster, CBC in Canada.
*21:26.760- 21:30.020* :  James Coppnell asked Punam how the interview came about.
*21:30.860- 21:34.260* :  So I first came across Uri Ahmed last November.
*21:34.260- 21:36.960* :  She and her sons were living in a squad of desert camps,
*21:37.420- 21:41.340* :  with the otherwise ensured and suspected ISL militants in northeast Syria.
*21:41.960- 21:44.860* :  And she had also to speak to us about a missing British child
*21:44.860- 21:48.380* :  I was searching for, and this is part of the Bloodlines podcast series.
*21:49.160- 21:52.880* :  And at first I had absolutely no idea about her husband's identity.
*21:53.180- 21:56.080* :  But after investigating further, I learned about the connection.
*21:56.800- 21:59.500* :  I discovered that she's met L. Shaikh when he was visiting
*21:59.500- 22:02.040* :  relatives in Canada back in 2007.
*22:02.640- 22:04.120* :  She was 17, he was 19.
*22:04.260- 22:08.360* :  They married in 2010 and he traveled to Syria in 2012.
*22:09.140- 22:10.980* :  He'd enjoyed him two years later,
*22:11.520- 22:14.600* :  after the murders carried out by L. Shaikh's ISL
*22:14.600- 22:16.580* :  had caused outrage across the world.
*22:17.120- 22:19.360* :  And I asked her that about L. Shaikh's crime.
*22:19.800- 22:21.400* :  Do you always how do you feel about it?
*22:21.740- 22:23.800* :  I mean, he would marry to someone who quite...
*22:23.960- 22:24.780* :  I didn't know.
*22:25.560- 22:26.100* :  You didn't know?
*22:26.360- 22:27.320* :  No. Yeah, yeah.
*22:27.320- 22:29.280* :  Well, he's been convicted if I didn't know.
*22:29.580- 22:30.980* :  I didn't understand it at that time.
*22:30.980- 22:34.620* :  I didn't understand why I can't just go to a friend's house for a little bit.
*22:34.620- 22:36.880* :  I didn't understand why he always had to know who it was.
*22:37.140- 22:38.540* :  Why we couldn't go out so much?
*22:38.540- 22:42.420* :  This is why he was so paranoid of like who comes to the house.
*22:42.420- 22:45.300* :  There was like hearings of drones or why we had to rush home or
*22:45.640- 22:46.820* :  all this paranoia.
*22:47.120- 22:48.720* :  Given L. Shaikh's role,
*22:49.200- 22:51.540* :  did you not know at all that this is what he was doing?
*22:51.540- 22:51.940* :  No.
*22:52.500- 22:53.240* :  God no. No.
*22:53.440- 22:55.020* :  He didn't share anything like that with you.
*22:55.040- 22:56.600* :  No, he wouldn't. He wouldn't share anything.
*22:56.720- 22:58.320* :  Anything. I can't even ask him where you're going.
*22:58.720- 22:59.380* :  You know what I mean?
*23:00.560- 23:02.780* :  He was very tight-lipper about everything.
*23:03.500- 23:05.280* :  Don't ask where I am. Don't ask where I'm going.
*23:05.780- 23:06.420* :  Don't ask where I went.
*23:06.980- 23:07.900* :  Don't ask who is that.
*23:08.200- 23:09.520* :  Don't ask who's coming.
*23:10.280- 23:11.580* :  Don't ask who's in the other room.
*23:11.580- 23:12.540* :  Don't ask...
*23:12.600- 23:13.700* :  Where is Tira Ahmed now?
*23:14.120- 23:17.060* :  Well, Tira Ahmed is now in Toronto in Canada.
*23:17.640- 23:21.140* :  She and her sons were among a group of Canadian women and children
*23:21.640- 23:24.780* :  repatriated to Canada from Syria back in April.
*23:25.440- 23:28.380* :  Now the 33-year-old was arrested upon arrival.
*23:28.940- 23:30.380* :  She was then granted bail.
*23:30.380- 23:33.240* :  She's been ordered to live under specific restrictions
*23:34.020- 23:35.780* :  according to a terrorism peace bond.
*23:36.200- 23:40.340* :  On Monday, that bond was being used in a court in Branton in Ontario.
*23:41.120- 23:43.080* :  And the Crown lawyer has argued that
*23:43.280- 23:45.700* :  honoured to have been steeped in our side geology
*23:46.420- 23:48.780* :  and it would have been likely that she knew of her husband's role
*23:48.780- 23:50.380* :  with a group before leaving for Canada.
*23:51.280- 23:54.280* :  Put arm to nature and you can get that new podcast
*23:54.280- 23:57.820* :  series, Bloodlines, wherever you get your podcast from.
*23:59.540- 24:02.620* :  It's a scandal that has overshadowed football in Spain.
*24:02.620- 24:06.540* :  The president of one of the country's biggest and most prestigious clubs,
*24:06.540- 24:09.340* :  Barcelona, is now under formal investigation
*24:09.500- 24:12.240* :  in connection with an alleged bribery scheme
*24:12.240- 24:16.000* :  during its golden years of domestic and European glory.
*24:16.700- 24:19.940* :  Our European editor, Danny Eberhard, told me more about the allegations.
*24:20.620- 24:23.740* :  They link into a tax investigation into a company
*24:24.260- 24:27.040* :  that was run by the number two of Spanish referring,
*24:27.040- 24:29.620* :  a man called José María Enrique de Negraera,
*24:29.820- 24:30.620* :  and his son.
*24:31.020- 24:34.860* :  And the tax investigation showed that large payments were coming from Barcelona
*24:34.940- 24:38.300* :  over a period from 2001 to 2018.
*24:38.460- 24:41.640* :  These totaled some $7.7 million.
*24:42.740- 24:44.740* :  The wider investigation came from there.
*24:44.740- 24:49.040* :  Barcelona says that these payments were made for videos
*24:49.040- 24:52.220* :  compiled about referees to be used in coaching,
*24:52.780- 24:55.600* :  for example, to help players know the sort of referees
*24:55.600- 24:57.940* :  that might give you a yellow card for a certain offense
*24:57.940- 24:59.080* :  or something like that.
*24:59.680- 25:02.060* :  But obviously, there's a suspicion that actually
*25:02.060- 25:03.480* :  this was about bribery.
*25:03.900- 25:06.340* :  A judge has been examining this and he suspects
*25:06.340- 25:08.240* :  that Barcelona may have got an advantage.
*25:08.980- 25:11.800* :  Over these years, through some sort of corrupt scheme.
*25:12.120- 25:15.600* :  And you've named a couple of people who has said to be involved in this.
*25:15.920- 25:19.660* :  On the Barcelona side, the club itself is under suspicion.
*25:20.340- 25:23.000* :  And then three presidents, this decision now,
*25:23.360- 25:26.800* :  concerns the current president, a man called Juana La Porta.
*25:27.200- 25:29.520* :  He was previously president once before.
*25:29.940- 25:32.820* :  And this is about his first term as a president.
*25:32.820- 25:36.060* :  But it's also about two presidents subsequent to him.
*25:36.540- 25:38.800* :  And also, the Barcelona board itself.
*25:38.940- 25:41.880* :  So lots of people being caught up in this.
*25:42.220- 25:43.700* :  And what is Barcelona saying?
*25:44.140- 25:46.160* :  Barcelona and all the other people,
*25:46.160- 25:48.780* :  so the presidents and the referees and the son,
*25:49.100- 25:50.640* :  all deny wrongdoing.
*25:50.640- 25:54.000* :  So at this stage, no one has been charged either.
*25:54.420- 25:57.620* :  So we are waiting to see what happens when the investigation continues
*25:58.100- 26:00.340* :  to see whether the judge believes there's enough evidence
*26:00.340- 26:03.920* :  to actually bring charges on bribery and corruption in sport.
*26:04.640- 26:05.600* :  Danny Eberhardt.
*26:06.120- 26:10.220* :  Japan's government has unveiled measures to counter overtourism
*26:10.560- 26:12.760* :  at famous sites, including Mount Fuji,
*26:13.160- 26:16.580* :  which are struggling with the post-pandemic surge of foreign visitors.
*26:17.240- 26:18.420* :  Will Leonardo reports?
*26:18.960- 26:20.740* :  Japan's Prime Minister, from Yorquistar,
*26:20.740- 26:24.620* :  said local communities were being impacted by a huge surge in visitor numbers,
*26:24.620- 26:28.140* :  including by a particularly Japanese concern, their bad manners.
*26:28.740- 26:31.680* :  The new measures mean rail operators will be allowed to hike fees
*26:31.680- 26:35.580* :  during busy periods, and tourists encourage towards less-traveled spots.
*26:35.580- 26:38.840* :  Japan has seen foreign tourism return to near-record levels,
*26:38.840- 26:43.180* :  helped by Beijing's lifting of restrictions on outbound tour groups from China.
*26:43.740- 26:47.120* :  While the economy has benefited, famous spots are being blighted by crowds,
*26:47.120- 26:50.240* :  not least Japan's sacred, highest peak, Mount Fuji.
*26:50.840- 26:54.100* :  Their officials have complained about busloads of unprepared climbers,
*26:54.100- 26:58.140* :  leaving huge piles of rubbish and even sleeping in toilets to escape the cold.
*26:58.860- 27:02.400* :  Will Leonardo, let's return to our top story.
*27:03.040- 27:08.200* :  Anra is the UN agency that provides all sorts of support to Palestinians in Gaza.
*27:08.720- 27:13.680* :  Its schools and other compounds are now being used as shelters for thousands of people.
*27:14.300- 27:19.440* :  So, have they been told when the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza will open?
*27:20.220- 27:25.340* :  Here's Juliet Turner, Anra's communications director, who's based in Amman, in Jordan.
*27:25.940- 27:29.520* :  No, but we do hope that it happens as soon as possible.
*27:30.100- 27:33.740* :  If we are pre-positioning supplies and we are ready to go,
*27:34.020- 27:38.180* :  and then we need also other type of assistance, like for example food,
*27:38.180- 27:43.120* :  because 1.2 million people rely on food assistance in the Gaza Strip.
*27:43.620- 27:50.160* :  Do you ever have any problem with groups requisitioning your supplies of things like fuel and water?
*27:50.600- 27:57.600* :  So, Anra can confirm that there has not been any looting of our assistance across the Gaza Strip.
*27:57.960- 28:04.180* :  Anra is what we call a direct implementer, which means that we are a UN agency that is highly
*28:04.180- 28:10.340* :  operational in the Gaza Strip. We are the largest with 13,000 staff who provide the assistance
*28:10.340- 28:16.240* :  themselves to the population in need, and we've been doing it for more than seven decades now.
*28:17.020- 28:22.420* :  Indeed, and are you able to give the various parties the assurances that it won't fall into the
*28:22.420- 28:28.920* :  wrong hands, as it were? When we are in neutral and impartial UN agency, and we make sure to have
*28:28.920- 28:34.880* :  systems in place for scrutiny and monitoring and evaluation for where our assistance calls.
*28:34.880- 28:41.320* :  Our assistance has been going to the hands of Palestine refugees in need for more than 70 years now,
*28:41.600- 28:44.780* :  70 years. How urgent is it that that border crossing
*28:44.780- 28:51.480* :  opens? Are we talking hours or days? Super urgent. We're already very, very late. Before the war,
*28:51.480- 28:57.400* :  we used to bring in supplies all the time into the Gaza Strip, and now with 10 days of this very
*28:57.400- 29:03.840* :  tight siege with no assistance coming in as disastrous. I have been some talk of creating
*29:03.840- 29:10.060* :  safe zones in southern Gaza, where it would be easier to supply people with the aid that they
*29:10.060- 29:15.800* :  need. Have you heard anything more about that? What we do know, James, is that no place is safe in
*29:15.800- 29:22.240* :  Gaza. I mean, just yesterday there was a hospital that has come under attack. We had an unrest
*29:22.240- 29:28.940* :  call that has come under attack. We keep losing staff members. The border crossing may open,
*29:28.940- 29:34.480* :  the trucks may start to drive across, but it's not going to be easy getting the supplies to the
*29:34.480- 29:39.740* :  people who need it given the ongoing conflict. Well, there needs to be a ceasefire as soon as
*29:39.740- 29:45.600* :  possible. Because otherwise, people will continue to be killed totally unnecessarily. The
*29:45.600- 29:51.640* :  villains will continue to be killed totally unnecessarily. And yes, it will complicate this massive
*29:51.640- 29:56.560* :  humanitarian operation that we've been running in the Gaza Strip. It will complicate massively.
*29:57.380- 30:04.080* :  That was Anra's Juliet Turner speaking there to James Menendez. Our international editor, Jeremy Boen,
*30:04.080- 30:09.240* :  is in the other Palestinian territory, the West Bank. And he's been looking at what President Biden
*30:09.240- 30:14.780* :  achieved on his visit to Israel, given the setback of not meeting Arab leaders.
*30:15.380- 30:21.420* :  President Biden came here to support Israel's war effort while finding a way to ease the humanitarian
*30:21.420- 30:27.860* :  catastrophe in the Gaza Strip. Our luckily hospital was hit before he'd even bordered Air Force 1
*30:27.860- 30:34.280* :  to fly to Tel Aviv. That made it much harder, even impossible to square a very difficult circle.
*30:34.780- 30:40.140* :  The deal Joe Biden announced to open Gaza's border to humanitarian traffic from Egypt
*30:40.140- 30:46.520* :  will allow him to say the trip was worth it. For Palestinians, the relief will be real but limited.
*30:46.520- 30:52.760* :  Israel says fuel will not be allowed in, which is needed for generators to keep hospitals going.
*30:53.360- 30:58.580* :  Joe Biden can also say he's delivered a message to Israel's enemies in Iran and Lebanon.
*30:59.100- 31:04.540* :  His presence plus the two aircraft carrier battle groups he's sent to the Eastern Mediterranean
*31:04.620- 31:11.860* :  has underlined America's determination to deter a wider war. The president's summit with Arab
*31:11.860- 31:17.900* :  leaders in Jordan was cancelled after the attack on Al-Akli Hospital. Arab kings, princes and
*31:17.900- 31:24.360* :  presidents know their populations have made up their minds about America's complicity in Israel's
*31:24.360- 31:29.160* :  killing of civilians. Whatever evidence to the contrary, the Israeli army provides.
*31:29.260- 31:36.340* :  Arab leaders need to identify with popular anger in their own countries. And they must fear
*31:36.340- 31:43.120* :  that if they don't, there could be a revival of the uprisings that swept the Arab world in 2011.
*31:44.280- 31:45.060* :  Jeremy Byron
*31:47.580- 31:51.840* :  That's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*31:52.320- 31:56.740* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, send us an email.
