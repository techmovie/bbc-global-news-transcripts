*00:30.200- 00:32.720* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:34.860- 00:39.640* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMC on Monday the 30th of October. These are our main stories.
*00:39.640- 00:44.740* :  Israel steps up its operations in Gaza with hundreds of missiles fired into the north,
*00:45.320- 00:48.920* :  followed by a land incursion that briefly cut the main north-south road.
*00:49.720- 00:54.480* :  And Russia and China have warned Washington of the dangers of meddling in other nations business.
*00:54.940- 01:02.440* :  Also in this podcast, a major military and police search is underway in Colombia to find the
*01:02.440- 01:06.680* :  father of one of Liverpool's star football players, Luiz Diaz.
*01:10.580- 01:15.860* :  Israel's military strategy in Gaza seems to be becoming a little clearer today. It's
*01:15.860- 01:21.980* :  said it had fired missiles and artillery shells at 600 more Hamas targets. And then for several
*01:21.980- 01:27.480* :  hours, Israeli military vehicles cut one of the two main roads linking the north and south of
*01:27.480- 01:33.320* :  the strip. And Israeli tanker, accompanied by military bulldozers, fired on an approaching car.
*01:33.320- 01:38.020* :  The tank seems to have pulled back now. But as I've been hearing from our correspondent in Gaza,
*01:38.020- 01:43.700* :  Ruchdi Abu al-Aluf, the Israeli maneuvers are likely to be a forerunner of a broader push.
*01:44.440- 01:49.760* :  I think the picture is more clear now that two Israeli tanks and Abu Dosa,
*01:50.100- 01:56.520* :  they infiltrate from the eastern border of Gaza. And they drove all the way to Salah Dinrod.
*01:56.520- 02:03.780* :  Salah Dinrod is the main road that link Gaza from far north to far south. The location is
*02:03.780- 02:10.360* :  exactly where the Israelis asked the people to leave. They said, this is the line. People in Gaza
*02:10.360- 02:18.040* :  city and the north should go south to the middle area of Hanyunis and Drafa. So now the tanks
*02:18.040- 02:24.160* :  were infiltrating about like three, four kilometers from the border. We are not quite sure for how
*02:24.160- 02:30.400* :  long, about one hour or two hours. And we understand that when the tanks approach the area, a tank
*02:30.400- 02:38.000* :  shield hit a car where three people were killed. The Hamas ran authority here. They were all
*02:38.000- 02:44.260* :  civilians. They were traveling back to their home in Gaza city. And they were hit by Israeli tank.
*02:44.860- 02:50.740* :  Now we understand from a driver who was able to cross the line back to Gaza city.
*02:51.220- 02:56.720* :  And he told me that the road is open and tanks are not operating in this area anymore.
*02:57.460- 03:05.060* :  This afternoon Israeli airstrikes resumed and they hit the same area around the hospital again.
*03:05.740- 03:11.640* :  So the focus of the Israeli military operation is in Gaza city and the north. Most of the
*03:11.640- 03:17.540* :  airstrikes were in this area and this area has been bombed heavily from sea, land and air.
*03:17.860- 03:23.380* :  Now Rushdie, you're in Hanyunis in the southern part of the Gaza strip. We understand that 30 trucks
*03:23.380- 03:29.900* :  carrying humanitarian aid have got into Gaza over the last few hours. What impact if any
*03:30.340- 03:33.500* :  is that likely to have on the humanitarian situation where you are?
*03:34.380- 03:41.400* :  Yeah, for the last ten days since Egypt started to allow the humanitarian aid about 130, 140
*03:41.400- 03:47.420* :  trucks were all allowed. Today was the biggest number about 30. They are talking. The number might
*03:47.420- 03:54.360* :  reach 70 trucks into Gaza. What the UN said? The UN is the largest humanitarian aid organization
*03:54.360- 03:59.900* :  helping two-thirds of the population who are in the south. They said we need at least 100 truck
*03:59.900- 04:06.200* :  everyday to be able to meet the needs of those who had to leave their homes and they live,
*04:06.640- 04:11.080* :  they need shelter, they need water, they need electricity, they need medicine and everything.
*04:11.080- 04:17.600* :  They were keep like describing the aid coming as a drop in the ocean. But today with more trucks
*04:17.600- 04:24.060* :  are coming. There is a growing hope here especially in the south that sustainable humanitarian
*04:24.060- 04:30.740* :  corridor can help those who are in need. Tints around me, families are sleeping on the ground.
*04:31.400- 04:39.200* :  Kids are big for water and for food. Very difficult situation and those people hoping that Egypt
*04:39.200- 04:45.460* :  will allow more aid, more truck and that those people will not keep struggling anymore.
*04:46.000- 04:51.300* :  That was Ruchti Abu Al-Luf. Let's get Israel's perspective now on the current military operation
*04:51.300- 04:54.700* :  in Gaza. I spoke to our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yuland Nell.
*04:55.380- 04:59.600* :  Well, we've had the Israeli military briefing earlier, the Israeli military saying that it's
*04:59.940- 05:06.960* :  hit 600 targets in 24 hours in Gaza and confirming that it's continuing to expand its ground
*05:06.960- 05:12.560* :  operations that more troops have entered Gaza in the past day. It said that it's killed dozens
*05:12.560- 05:18.120* :  of terrorists who barricade themselves in buildings and tried to attack its forces, those were
*05:18.120- 05:23.360* :  its words. Hamas has confirmed that, of course, its armed faction has been fighting Israeli soldiers.
*05:23.960- 05:27.800* :  There was a lot of interest in the Israeli military briefing after we had this
*05:27.880- 05:33.940* :  sighting of a Israeli tanks just to the south of Gaza City, cutting off one of the main north
*05:33.940- 05:39.740* :  to south roads. Everyone speculating could this be a significant advance on Gaza City,
*05:39.740- 05:43.880* :  but the Israeli military spokesman didn't want to comment on that further saying that it was
*05:43.880- 05:49.840* :  about the security of troops on the ground. Obviously, there's huge pressure on Israel to
*05:50.480- 05:56.780* :  facilitate humanitarian aid getting into the Gaza Strip. We heard there from Ruchti Abu Al-Luf in
*05:56.780- 06:04.680* :  Gaza that 30 trucks have got in or ran about 30 over the last day or so. What is Israel's position?
*06:05.100- 06:10.480* :  Do you sense that there's a change in it, the more pressure that comes on diplomatically?
*06:11.120- 06:15.940* :  I mean, we've heard again from Israeli officials in the course of the day who insist that there
*06:15.940- 06:21.060* :  are not food shortages in Gaza, something which is contradicted by the different humanitarian
*06:21.060- 06:26.920* :  agencies is contradicted by Israeli NGOs who follow up on all of this as well, of course, for what
*06:26.920- 06:31.280* :  we're hearing from colleagues on the ground. I mean, it was a worrying development when it comes
*06:31.280- 06:37.220* :  to sort of civil order in Gaza when we had Unruir saying that its aid stores were stormed yesterday
*06:37.760- 06:43.200* :  in search of food. And really, I think what seems to be happening, perhaps behind the scenes,
*06:43.200- 06:48.420* :  we know there are lots of negotiations that are going on, but it does seem that humanitarian aid
*06:48.420- 06:54.800* :  and, of course, fuel are being used as bargaining chips here as well as for its own security reasons,
*06:54.820- 06:59.940* :  it's keeping oversight of what goes in to the Gaza Strip, even though it's going through Egypt's
*06:59.940- 07:05.180* :  Rafa crossing. It said it wants to make sure that supplies are not diverted and sent to Hamas,
*07:05.800- 07:11.200* :  but we also have heard these reports, according to Reuters news agency quoting
*07:11.200- 07:16.960* :  unnamed sources that are following up on Qatar mediated negotiations between Israel and Hamas
*07:16.960- 07:22.460* :  on hostages. There's a report saying that Hamas wants a five-day pause to allow aid and fuel
*07:22.460- 07:28.620* :  in in return for the release of civilian hostages. We've got no way of verifying that ourselves,
*07:28.620- 07:33.280* :  but it does sound like it could be a part of the negotiations that are going on.
*07:33.960- 07:38.820* :  Yolanda, as more areas are hit by military strikes, I suppose a lot of people are talking
*07:38.820- 07:44.100* :  about the long-term viability of the different communities in the Gaza Strip, aren't they?
*07:44.640- 07:50.660* :  That's right. And actually, in recent days, I've been meeting people who have relatives
*07:51.280- 07:57.180* :  in Gaza from the small Palestinian Christian community in the occupied West Bank. I mean,
*07:57.180- 08:02.420* :  we often forget that there are these relationships between people in Gaza and the West Bank,
*08:02.420- 08:08.200* :  because the two territories have been separated in particular since Hamas took over Gaza
*08:08.720- 08:15.700* :  by force back in 2007. And so I was talking to people who have even lost family members because,
*08:15.700- 08:23.060* :  of course, there was an Israeli strike that affected one of the oldest churches in the Gaza St
*08:23.060- 08:32.500* :  Preferious just over a week ago. A prayer for peace at Bethlehem's Nativity Church that isn't being
*08:32.500- 08:39.160* :  answered so far. Worshipers here say they feel solidarity with everyone suffering in Gaza.
*08:53.180- 08:54.660* :  All of us know that.
*09:03.420- 09:08.800* :  In Gaza, it's over a week since an Israeli air strike hit the compound of St Preferious,
*09:08.800- 09:14.160* :  the site of one of the oldest churches in the world. Israel says it was targeting a nearby
*09:14.160- 09:20.620* :  Hamas command center. Many of the 1000 Christians living here were sheltering in the church grounds.
*09:20.700- 09:29.720* :  They were left feeling nowhere was safe. A 2000 year old church, this man shouted as he
*09:29.720- 09:34.460* :  brought wounded relatives to hospital. There were no weapons, just people and kids.
*09:39.880- 09:45.400* :  There was despair at a mass funeral held outside the church where the bodies of the dead were laid
*09:45.400- 09:51.840* :  out and white sheets next to the rubble which crushed them. 18 were killed, four of them small
*09:51.840- 09:57.320* :  children. They were deeply mourned here, but also by relatives living in the West Bank.
*10:03.920- 10:09.340* :  As a special church service near Bethlehem, Shorin Awad lights a candle for her aunt who was
*10:09.340- 10:14.040* :  killed. She says her family and Gaza stayed there through successive wars.
*10:14.680- 10:18.680* :  We ask them do you want to leave? They would say no, this is our truth, this is where we were born,
*10:18.680- 10:23.320* :  but this time for the first time in their history let's say that they said the minute
*10:23.620- 10:28.960* :  you know they open borders, they don't know if they want to say that is if they actually survive.
*10:29.580- 10:30.720* :  None of them are hopeful.
*10:34.920- 10:40.760* :  Just months ago in Gaza, during the Orthodox Easter, St Preferious was packed with families.
*10:41.500- 10:47.280* :  Christians here are deeply connected to their church and the land, but now Reverend Doctor Moon
*10:47.280- 10:51.860* :  the Isaac, a Lutheran pastor and academic in Bethlehem worries for them.
*10:52.580- 10:58.960* :  Gaza is one of the oldest Christian communities in the entire world. If you read about the
*10:59.360- 11:04.980* :  history of Christianity, in the first council of churches there were representatives of the church
*11:06.020- 11:12.720* :  in Gaza and right now one of the tragedies and I don't want to you know because of course we're
*11:12.720- 11:19.000* :  concerned about every human lives, but after all is done one of our biggest concerns and
*11:19.000- 11:25.080* :  fears is that this long long tradition of Christian presence in Gaza might come to an end.
*11:28.640- 11:33.600* :  As the bells of the Nativity Church ring out, souvenir shops nearby are shuttered.
*11:34.140- 11:39.320* :  Foreign pilgrims have deserted Bethlehem since the war started and decades of violence
*11:39.320- 11:43.740* :  and occupation have already seen many Christians leave the Holy Land for good.
*11:44.580- 11:47.200* :  This war could yet bring a new Exodus.
*11:48.840- 11:52.400* :  You land now reporting. Now to Russia.
*11:53.300- 12:04.380* :  And that is a sound of a mob storming an airport in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim Republic
*12:04.380- 12:10.120* :  in the South Caucasus region. They were searching out people who landed from Tel Aviv in Israel.
*12:10.500- 12:14.560* :  We got more details from Vitaly Shepchenko, Russia editor for BBC Monitor.
*12:15.540- 12:21.680* :  Hundreds of anti-Israeli protesters I think that's the best way to describe them. They stormed
*12:22.120- 12:28.820* :  the terminal building of the main airport at Mahachkala, which is a Russian North Caucasus
*12:28.820- 12:36.280* :  Republic of Dagestan, predominantly Muslim. And as you say they were looking for people rumored
*12:36.280- 12:42.820* :  to be refugees from Israel. And things got out of hand. Initially they were checking passports
*12:42.820- 12:50.920* :  in a very unauthorized way. And then they entered the runway and people arriving into Mahachkala.
*12:50.920- 12:57.440* :  We're blocked inside planes. As things started the moment, the authorities are in control
*12:57.440- 13:02.220* :  of the airport in Mahachkala. They've arrested more than 60 people.
*13:03.380- 13:08.980* :  20 people were injured, some of them police officers. But this is a very grave incident,
*13:08.980- 13:16.780* :  very unusual for something like this to happen in Russia recently. And of course all this is
*13:17.220- 13:24.560* :  triggered by the Hamas-Israel war and officials in the region. They have condemned the incident.
*13:24.560- 13:29.520* :  For example, the governor of Dagestan said it was a stab in the back for patriots and there was
*13:29.520- 13:37.000* :  outrages. But other officials, such as the local ombudsman, they said the understandable emotions
*13:37.100- 13:45.560* :  that drove this invasion, this mob and the ombudsman of Dagestan said that's okay, we need to observe
*13:45.560- 13:50.880* :  the law, but your emotions are understandable. And Vitaly, just briefly, I know that these people
*13:50.880- 13:56.180* :  were looking for Israelis. But with regards to the Jewish population in Dagestan in general,
*13:56.180- 14:01.720* :  it's a tiny population. But how much anti-Semitism is there in that Russia, Republic, and others?
*14:02.700- 14:08.840* :  Well, obviously it's widespread and it's by no means an isolated incident the day before the
*14:08.840- 14:15.240* :  airport invasion. And mob, in another Dagestanian town called Khassad-Yur, they entered the hotel
*14:15.240- 14:22.400* :  looking for Israeli refugees and elsewhere in North Caucasus. In Karachiwa-Cherkesea,
*14:23.000- 14:28.960* :  another mob, they rallied demanding that all Jews, and of them, they're very few there,
*14:29.320- 14:35.240* :  they need to be expelled. So clearly there's a bit of an anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic sentiment going
*14:35.240- 14:41.500* :  on a dark part of Russia. That was Vitaly Shivchenko. Still to come.
*14:48.620- 14:52.380* :  We find out why horror films may actually be good for your health.
*15:05.660- 15:11.240* :  Climate change. What's going on is this real. The climate question is the podcast exploring our
*15:11.240- 15:16.060* :  planet's changing environment and what we're doing across the world to adapt and respond to it.
*15:16.060- 15:21.240* :  The future is ahead of us. A very sensitive to the choices that make today. If we don't start
*15:21.240- 15:26.780* :  fixing it, we're going to be victims of it. The climate question from the BBC World Service,
*15:26.940- 15:32.540* :  find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*15:33.520- 15:38.060* :  Senior Chinese military chiefs and their Russian counterparts have been speaking at an
*15:38.060- 15:43.120* :  international security summit in Russia. Many of their public remarks are focused on the United
*15:43.120- 15:48.820* :  States, including this indirect criticism from a senior Chinese official, Zhang Yusha.
*15:52.620- 15:57.000* :  Some countries desire to see the world in chaos, deliberately create turbulence,
*15:57.800- 16:02.780* :  and interfere in other countries internal affairs, and instigate color revolutions.
*16:02.940- 16:08.640* :  Wherever these countries go, there's no peace. Our China correspondent, Steven McDonald,
*16:08.640- 16:13.320* :  is following the summit. I put it to him that while Mr Zhang didn't name the US,
*16:13.320- 16:18.620* :  it was fairly clear who his remarks were aimed at. Whenever you hear the Chinese government
*16:18.620- 16:25.620* :  referring to some other country instigating so-called color revolutions, that's code for the US.
*16:26.360- 16:31.340* :  So people will remember all those uprisings in the Middle East. According to Beijing's view of
*16:31.340- 16:37.340* :  things, this is all a CIA plot. They draw a parallel to Hong Kong for that matter, which is
*16:37.340- 16:43.560* :  described by the Chinese government as a colored revolution. It's a means of a guest diverting
*16:43.560- 16:49.180* :  from the fact that potentially people in Hong Kong may have wanted to instigate their own protests.
*16:49.180- 16:55.660* :  But anyway, I digress. The significant thing about this was that not only was he speaking in front
*16:55.660- 17:01.440* :  of the Russian Defence Minister, but this is a big military conference, and there's a US delegation
*17:01.540- 17:06.060* :  there from the Pentagon as well. So when he's up there, and Zhang Yoshua says,
*17:06.580- 17:11.540* :  certain countries, oh, the US shouldn't be meddling in other countries internal affairs,
*17:12.360- 17:16.680* :  they're sitting in the audience as he's saying this. But the funny thing is, so there he is,
*17:16.680- 17:22.840* :  he's criticising the US, and certainly Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shogu, even more directly
*17:22.840- 17:28.100* :  criticised the US. But then later on, Zhang Yoshua goes on to say, but we are actually willing
*17:28.100- 17:33.800* :  to develop military ties with the US under certain circumstances, so that on the one hand,
*17:33.800- 17:37.300* :  it's like a punch in the head and then, oh, but by the way, he's a bit of an olive branch to you.
*17:37.400- 17:41.560* :  Yeah, keeping the door open a little bit, but on a broader issue, Russia and China,
*17:41.740- 17:45.040* :  it's another sign of deeply ties between those two, isn't it?
*17:45.420- 17:50.140* :  Yes, well, whenever they have these big conferences, we saw it with the Belton Road Initiative
*17:50.380- 17:56.640* :  last week that that conference and there was Vladimir Putin given pride of place next to Xi Jinping.
*17:56.640- 18:03.140* :  And at this defence conference, there's Sergei Shogu also being given pride of place. He's also
*18:03.140- 18:08.840* :  given the opportunity to get up in front of all these other figures, you know, from various countries,
*18:09.540- 18:14.480* :  smashing the West for its involvement in Ukraine, warning of potential nuclear war,
*18:14.480- 18:19.740* :  actually saying that NATO under the US is also sort of trying to, according to him,
*18:20.240- 18:25.640* :  drag these tensions into Asia. And so you can see what they're trying to do is build up a sort
*18:25.640- 18:33.140* :  of a loose coalition against a US-led West as they set. And, you know, conferences like this
*18:33.140- 18:38.020* :  are used for it, even though it's supposed to be China's answer to the Shangri-La dialogue in
*18:38.020- 18:44.280* :  Singapore, which again, in theory is supposed to be a sort of neutral setting. Most of the people
*18:44.280- 18:50.360* :  have turned up for this are big supporters of Russia and China. Stephen McDonald. The property
*18:50.360- 18:55.680* :  developer Evergrande has been given a final lifeline before it faces possible liquidation.
*18:55.780- 19:01.380* :  A court in Hong Kong said the Chinese company, which owes a staggering $330 billion,
*19:01.660- 19:06.820* :  must come up with a concrete proposal by December to repay its foreign creditors,
*19:07.220- 19:13.020* :  otherwise the firm will be wound up. So given that Evergrande has so far been unable to pay back
*19:13.020- 19:17.680* :  its debts, what chance is there that it will be able to do so now? A question for our business
*19:17.680- 19:23.840* :  correspondent, Theo Leggett. It doesn't look likely at this stage. It would need a massive restructuring
*19:23.840- 19:30.440* :  of the company's debts. But, you know, this is China and a lot of the company's debt is held
*19:31.000- 19:37.140* :  in China. And if the government wants some kind of a bailout for Evergrande, it can make one
*19:37.140- 19:41.760* :  happen. The banking system is largely state-controlled. The reason it hasn't done that already
*19:41.760- 19:46.260* :  is obviously there is a moral hazard there. The Chinese government doesn't want to be seen to be
*19:46.260- 19:51.680* :  propping up a failing business. At the same time, it can't really afford Forevergrande to collapse
*19:52.320- 19:57.440* :  in a bad way because that would leave all sorts of people sitting on losses, including a million
*19:57.440- 20:02.060* :  people who have bought homes that haven't yet been finished. So that's why we've had this kind
*20:02.060- 20:06.820* :  of suspended animation for the past two years since Evergrande first defaulted. It's been
*20:06.820- 20:12.920* :  looking to find a solution that will satisfy its existing bondholders, its foreign lenders,
*20:13.440- 20:18.120* :  and avoid some kind of disorderly collapse. It hasn't been able to get one together,
*20:18.520- 20:23.180* :  and most recently it was unable to do so because of legal problems facing its founder
*20:23.680- 20:27.900* :  and some of its subsidiaries being under investigation over suspected criminal acts.
*20:27.900- 20:32.740* :  Now there is a concrete deadline of 4th December. It's very hard to see how something can be put
*20:32.740- 20:36.960* :  together in that time for it. And yet Beijing is very much caught between a rock and a hard
*20:36.960- 20:42.180* :  place over this. From what you were just saying, when push comes to shop, it will step in.
*20:42.900- 20:48.680* :  Something will happen, and the Chinese government would be at the center of it. The problem is
*20:48.680- 20:54.320* :  if Evergrande were to be allowed to collapse, we're kind of in unknown territory, there is an enormous
*20:54.320- 21:01.820* :  amount of borrowing here, $325 billion. Some of it from outside what you would call the regulated
*21:01.820- 21:09.220* :  financial system. A lot of small investors involved, local governments involved. So if you were to
*21:09.220- 21:14.200* :  have a disorderly collapse, that would ripple through China's economy, and we've already seen
*21:14.200- 21:17.860* :  that the problems that Evergrande have triggered off other effects elsewhere in the
*21:17.860- 21:23.300* :  property sector. So a solution really needs to be found because otherwise the consequences of
*21:23.300- 21:28.320* :  an Evergrande collapse, they're unpredictable, but they would be far-reaching. Theolecate.
*21:29.280- 21:34.060* :  In Colombia, a major military and police search is underway to find the father of one of Liverpool
*21:34.060- 21:39.540* :  football club star players, Luiz Diaz. The authorities are speculating that the people who
*21:39.540- 21:45.120* :  kidnapped him may have taken him to Venezuela. Vanessa Bush-Lukta is our online Latin America
*21:45.120- 21:51.680* :  editor. This happened on Saturday afternoon. The parents of Luiz Diaz were stopping at a petrol station
*21:51.680- 22:00.220* :  to buy some fruit when armed men approached him on motorcycles and seized them. Luckily the mother
*22:00.220- 22:04.860* :  has since been released. There was lots of pressure from police, so they managed to rescue her,
*22:05.360- 22:11.500* :  but his father, Luiz Manuel Diaz, is still being held by these people who are still to this point
*22:11.520- 22:19.480* :  unidentified. Local media saying they think it's more an armed gang rather than one of the guerrilla
*22:19.480- 22:24.600* :  groups that are still active in that area. He talked about the armed gangs, guerrilla groups,
*22:25.280- 22:29.320* :  kidnappings are pretty common in Colombia, specifically in this area of the country.
*22:30.100- 22:34.700* :  This area is a very troubled area because of its proximity to the Venezuelan border,
*22:34.700- 22:40.480* :  and there's a lot of smuggling going across. There's a lot of human trafficking of migrants,
*22:41.180- 22:45.840* :  so it is a dangerous area. However, it has to be stressed that the number of kidnappings
*22:46.100- 22:52.560* :  has dropped massively in Colombia since the late 1990s and the worst year, 2000.
*22:53.380- 22:59.440* :  Back then there were more than 3,500 kidnappings per year, but they're now in the low to,
*22:59.440- 23:05.440* :  you know, low hundreds. This year it's gone up slightly, but it's still in the low hundreds,
*23:05.440- 23:11.700* :  so much, much better than that kidnapping wave you have to almost call it was at its worst.
*23:11.860- 23:17.480* :  There has been an outpouring of sympathy and support for Luis Diaz and, of course,
*23:17.480- 23:24.280* :  for the wider family and, of course, the media is full of stories about the kidnapping and all
*23:24.280- 23:29.100* :  of the politicians and especially the police are, of course, doing their utmost to get his
*23:29.100- 23:35.840* :  father home safely. That was Vanessa Bushluter. A BBC investigation has found that some school
*23:35.840- 23:40.960* :  teachers in Kenya are beating pupils on a daily basis, despite the fact that corporal
*23:40.960- 23:46.440* :  punishment was banned more than 20 years ago. A reporter Tom Odulla, who himself went to a school
*23:46.440- 23:52.540* :  that beat children to punish them, has been investigating. This is a sports certificate. She was an
*23:52.540- 24:01.360* :  athlete. Mother's daughter Ebi died in 2019. The autopsy report revealed that she had
*24:02.520- 24:10.980* :  severe head injury, so somebody hit her to cause that kind of an injury leading to her death.
*24:11.320- 24:16.980* :  Her boarding school said she died in her sleep, but witnesses say she was beaten by the deputy
*24:16.980- 24:23.780* :  principal. Even with the autopsy results, it took several years to get the case properly investigated.
*24:24.220- 24:30.760* :  They were trying to force me to believe that my child fell from a bed, and that's why she died.
*24:31.640- 24:37.580* :  In Kenya, corporal punishment is an offense punishable under the prevention of torture act.
*24:38.380- 24:44.140* :  Yet, according to media reports, more than 20 children have died at the hands of their teachers
*24:44.140- 24:52.680* :  in the last five years alone. This is 16-year-old Safin. We set exams and I failed. That's why
*24:52.680- 24:58.940* :  he beat us. He beat me on my waist and I got injured. Safin had to be taken to hospital.
*24:59.800- 25:05.060* :  The teacher, who denies the accusation, was transferred to another school.
*25:05.760- 25:10.360* :  Safin's family say they turned to the independent body responsible for teachers.
*25:11.280- 25:16.400* :  The teacher service commission, but there was no support. On condition of anonymity,
*25:16.700- 25:22.000* :  a source from the commission told me, reports of the most severe school beatings have
*25:22.000- 25:29.700* :  go droopled in the last three years, from 7 to 29. It is becoming a crisis because we feel it's
*25:29.700- 25:36.220* :  going out of hand now. Cases of children being injured and being even death. The TSE source
*25:36.220- 25:42.180* :  told me rogue teachers are protected at every level of Kenyan society, with cases swept
*25:42.180- 25:47.400* :  under the carpet. By the time the case reaches us, it is already totally diluted.
*25:48.140- 25:54.440* :  So much evidence has been corrupted. We put these claims to the TSE, but they did not respond.
*25:55.640- 26:00.380* :  After four years of tireless campaigning by mother, in spring this year,
*26:00.680- 26:06.320* :  what could be the first ever prosecution of its kind? The school official accused of killing
*26:06.320- 26:12.960* :  Abby, facing trial for mother. She denies the judge, saying she wasn't at school when the incident
*26:13.180- 26:19.800* :  happened. Mother has vowed to keep fighting until justice is served for her daughter.
*26:22.000- 26:27.000* :  Tom Adula for BBC Africa Eye. Now, if you watch horror films,
*26:27.340- 26:32.300* :  do you do so whilst ducking behind a sofa or are you one of those people who even runs out of the
*26:32.300- 26:37.360* :  room? Well, some new research suggests you might be better off staying put and watching it all
*26:37.360- 26:41.560* :  with your eyes wide open. This report from the newsrooms Rachel Wright.
*26:46.880- 26:51.700* :  Probably one of the scariest pieces of music accompanying one of the scariest scenes in film
*26:51.700- 26:57.420* :  history, the stabbing in the shower in Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. I'm not a fan of being
*26:57.420- 27:01.180* :  half frightened to death by watching a man stabbing a defenseless woman in a shower,
*27:01.180- 27:08.220* :  but it seems perhaps I should stick it out. Dr Christian Knowles, a neuropsychologist at Queen
*27:08.220- 27:13.980* :  Mary University in Edinburgh, says in a new report that watching horror films is good for us because
*27:13.980- 27:19.680* :  it improves our tolerance to pain. How? Well, it seems that when the body feels pain or stress,
*27:19.680- 27:24.320* :  it produces endorphins, which are the bodies way of making us feel pleasure and reward.
*27:24.320- 27:30.060* :  Dr Knowles says that horror films provide people with a safe way to explore being frightened because
*27:30.060- 27:35.660* :  in films, the scary bits are more simplistic than in real life. And that's not the only benefit
*27:35.660- 27:41.520* :  you get. A report from 2012 found that watching a 90 minute horror movie burned roughly the same
*27:41.520- 27:52.840* :  amount of calories as going for a short walk. And then there's the exorcist, a film about a little
*27:52.840- 27:58.820* :  girl possessed by the devil, often rated as one of the scariest movies of all time. Well, it's just
*27:58.820- 28:04.280* :  been re-released on the big screen with extra scary bits added to celebrate its 50th anniversary
*28:04.280- 28:10.000* :  and conveniently just in time for Halloween. So if you want to improve your resistance to pain,
*28:10.000- 28:15.060* :  lose weight and just scream very loudly, take a little trip to a cinema near you.
*28:19.120- 28:20.120* :  Rachel Wright reporting.
*28:23.420- 28:26.460* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News
*28:26.460- 28:30.760* :  Podcast later on. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can

*28:42.680- 28:46.580* :  Over the past few weeks, we've done a number of special editions of the Global News Podcast
*28:46.580- 28:51.900* :  in conjunction with our colleagues at the conflict podcast, putting listeners questions about what's
*28:51.900- 28:57.640* :  happening in Gaza and Israel to our expert correspondence covering it. Between them, they have been
*28:57.640- 29:02.960* :  watching and analysing developments close up for decades, so if anyone can explain, it's them.
*29:03.560- 29:07.660* :  And events are still unfolding, so we need clarity and expertise more than ever.
*29:07.660- 29:13.500* :  That's why we plan to record another one soon. So do please keep sending in your questions.
*29:14.120- 29:18.500* :  Either record a voice message or simply write your question and send it to the usual address,
*29:18.500- 29:26.640* :  globalpodcast, at bbc.co.uk. And you can find the first three episodes wherever you found this
*29:26.640- 29:33.280* :  podcast. Thank you. This edition of the Global News Podcast was mixed by Shalota Taujinska.
*29:33.500- 29:38.560* :  The producer was Stephanie Titson. The editing is Karen Martin. I'm Nick Martin and until next time,
*29:38.880- 29:39.060* :  goodbye.
