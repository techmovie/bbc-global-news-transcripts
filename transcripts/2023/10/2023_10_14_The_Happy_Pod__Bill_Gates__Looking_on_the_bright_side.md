*00:00.060- 00:04.040* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service
*00:04.040- 00:08.740* :  with reports and analysis from across the world, the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.600* :  BBC World Service Podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:30.120- 00:33.780* :  This is Andrew Peach in London with the happy pod, including fast runners,
*00:33.780- 00:39.460* :  giant pumpkins, fat bears, and a man who thinks just like we do. Bill Gates.
*00:39.500- 00:44.660* :  The human condition over the last several hundred years has improved a lot.
*00:45.200- 00:48.560* :  And so that kind of progress that's going to continue.
*00:49.040- 00:51.540* :  So strap in for half an hour of positive news.
*00:52.240- 00:55.980* :  Hi, I'm Travis in California and you're listening to the happy pod.
*00:56.260- 00:59.840* :  Hello, I'm Cristina from Barcelona and disease, happy pod.
*00:59.840- 01:05.720* :  Hi, everyone. My name is Janela Bradshaw from the beautiful islands of Antigobar View
*01:05.720- 01:09.480* :  that Ann Redonda and you're listening to the happy pod.
*01:13.880- 01:16.700* :  On the way, winning, winning big at the Nobel Prize Awards.
*01:16.700- 01:19.140* :  I was in a class when I heard the news.
*01:19.300- 01:24.580* :  I was getting lots of congratulation messages and I was really, really proud that my mom
*01:24.580- 01:26.120* :  had won the Nobel Prize.
*01:26.460- 01:28.600* :  A Caribbean island brought back to life.
*01:28.600- 01:33.380* :  The Redonda of yesterday was one that was dying.
*01:33.740- 01:37.480* :  Scientists in Spain on a new way of testing for breast cancer.
*01:37.920- 01:42.340* :  Perhaps this could help your future wife or your future child.
*01:42.500- 01:45.300* :  So we love to work in this kind of project.
*01:45.700- 01:47.720* :  And world records all over the place.
*01:48.180- 01:51.480* :  This record has been held overseas, I will say, for 10 years.
*01:51.480- 01:54.940* :  So to get it back in the States is super huge.
*01:55.140- 01:56.780* :  All on the way in the happy pod.
*02:02.260- 02:06.520* :  First, it's challenging to stay positive about many things going on in the world,
*02:06.520- 02:08.560* :  particularly the climate crisis.
*02:09.080- 02:13.180* :  But the tech giant and billionaire Bill Gates has been telling us about how he
*02:13.180- 02:16.160* :  stays optimistic in the face of the tough predictions.
*02:16.160- 02:20.440* :  Greia Jackson went to meet him for a BBC podcast called The Climate Question.
*02:20.960- 02:23.520* :  He is surprisingly optimistic, right?
*02:23.520- 02:26.560* :  I think a lot of people when they hear the word climate change,
*02:26.560- 02:31.200* :  they think of all the doom and gloom and there's sometimes quite negative outlook
*02:31.800- 02:32.820* :  of where we're heading.
*02:33.320- 02:37.140* :  And what's even more surprising is that he's been on the ground in Africa for decades
*02:37.140- 02:39.060* :  with the foundation working on healthcare.
*02:39.760- 02:43.920* :  But that's also meant that he's seen the very real effects of climate change
*02:44.420- 02:45.780* :  firsthand for those people.
*02:46.360- 02:48.900* :  And that's been a real motivator for him.
*02:49.720- 02:54.080* :  You know, when I go to Africa and I see the tough conditions there,
*02:54.400- 02:59.400* :  and I definitely heard from farmers that the climate is getting worse for them.
*02:59.840- 03:04.440* :  And you can just look at their malnourished children and see how unjust that is.
*03:04.580- 03:07.700* :  So that definitely makes me angry.
*03:07.700- 03:10.760* :  It makes me think, okay, can we fix this?
*03:11.540- 03:14.400* :  Fortunately, and humans are very innovative.
*03:15.220- 03:16.400* :  And that makes you feel positive?
*03:17.180- 03:23.480* :  Yes, I think the human condition over the last several hundred years has improved a lot.
*03:23.960- 03:29.420* :  We start the century with over 10 million children dying under the age of five every year.
*03:30.060- 03:32.060* :  Now we have that below five million.
*03:32.940- 03:39.020* :  And so that kind of progress, where it's better now than it was back in the year 2000,
*03:39.540- 03:40.680* :  that's going to continue.
*03:41.800- 03:47.500* :  And he sees this sort of progress in health, as analogous to what's happening in the world
*03:47.500- 03:49.580* :  of climate tech and climate solutions.
*03:50.540- 03:54.840* :  Now it's going to say Bill Gates is a guy who's revolutionized the world's technology.
*03:54.840- 03:59.420* :  So you'd think if you were looking to anything for solutions, it would be to tech.
*03:59.920- 04:01.440* :  What's he excited about in that sphere?
*04:02.480- 04:06.680* :  I mean, a whole range of things that you wouldn't necessarily think of technology.
*04:06.680- 04:10.960* :  So for instance, throughout resistance seeds, he's helping to develop,
*04:11.420- 04:16.380* :  particularly ones that work well in Africa, where they're really feeling the effects of climate change.
*04:16.740- 04:21.420* :  But also things like green cement, you may not realise, but cement contributes something like
*04:21.540- 04:23.680* :  8% of the world's planet warming gases.
*04:23.680- 04:25.160* :  So it's a huge contributor.
*04:25.160- 04:29.480* :  So he's helping to develop greener versions that would slash those emissions down.
*04:29.960- 04:34.780* :  And then there's the more what you might think of as sort of typical interventions,
*04:34.820- 04:41.680* :  like artificial intelligence that helps warn people if climate-fueled extreme weather is approaching.
*04:42.660- 04:48.560* :  I'm putting billions into climate to try and speed up the progress.
*04:49.680- 04:56.060* :  It is a lot, but I do see that people are coming together and committing to this.
*04:56.380- 05:02.540* :  And so we won't go anywhere near those really big temperature increases.
*05:03.540- 05:06.580* :  Gray, we can hear your full conversation with Bill Gates on a podcast called
*05:06.580- 05:11.420* :  The Climate Question, which listeners can find on BBC Sounds and wherever else they get their
*05:11.740- 05:13.180* :  BBC podcasts from.
*05:13.180- 05:15.280* :  But not many of us get to meet Bill Gates.
*05:15.280- 05:17.480* :  What's he like? What was your encounter with him like?
*05:18.860- 05:23.860* :  Yeah, he's a very reserved character, but as soon as you get him talking about things he feels
*05:23.860- 05:29.100* :  that are important, he becomes really animated, this really passionate person.
*05:29.180- 05:35.080* :  And I was surprised that he even let me take a selfie with him at the very end of the interview.
*05:35.080- 05:37.620* :  I wasn't sure I was going to get one, but he's a nice guy.
*05:38.100- 05:40.080* :  And thanks to my BBC colleague, Greia Jackson.
*05:40.080- 05:44.880* :  It's been a record year for women winning the Nobel prizes in economics.
*05:44.880- 05:47.460* :  It was the first time a woman had won the honour solo.
*05:48.120- 05:51.600* :  The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award
*05:52.120- 05:57.800* :  Sweden's six banks prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel 2023
*05:58.780- 06:03.180* :  to Professor Claudia Goldin, Harvard University, USA
*06:04.500- 06:08.720* :  for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes.
*06:08.760- 06:14.080* :  Claudia Goldin is a professor at Harvard University. She spent her career studying the gender
*06:14.280- 06:16.460* :  pay gap and how it's changed over time.
*06:17.340- 06:25.060* :  I am delighted that an area that includes the history of women, what women do, what they have
*06:25.060- 06:32.800* :  done, what they do in various countries, and also the area of gender that both of these
*06:33.360- 06:40.840* :  are being recognised because they are done, and many of the people who do them don't feel that
*06:40.940- 06:42.740* :  they are completely recognised.
*06:43.620- 06:48.180* :  Professor Goldin has also published studies on the impact of contraception on women's careers
*06:48.680- 06:51.600* :  and why women now make up the majority of undergraduates.
*06:52.220- 06:56.320* :  Ingrid Werner is a member of the Nobel Prize Committee and said Goldin's work had helped
*06:56.320- 06:59.260* :  to emphasise the importance of the female labour force.
*06:59.840- 07:06.440* :  I think it's important to re-emphasise that understanding women's participation in the
*07:06.440- 07:11.740* :  labour force and her earnings potential is incredibly important for the society,
*07:12.300- 07:19.080* :  because if women are in some way hinder from participating or participate on unequal terms,
*07:19.080- 07:25.620* :  we lose out in terms of skills, labour supply and resources that could promote growth and
*07:25.620- 07:27.980* :  prosperity. So it is super important.
*07:28.480- 07:32.780* :  The achievement followed on from the jailed Iranian activist Nagas Mahamadi becoming the first
*07:32.780- 07:38.080* :  Muslim woman to be awarded Nobel Peace Prize. She won the award for campaigning against the
*07:38.080- 07:42.260* :  oppression of women in Iran, where she is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence.
*07:42.900- 07:45.960* :  A daughter Kiara told us how proud she was when she heard the news.
*07:49.620- 07:55.380* :  I was in my secondary school in a class when I heard the news. At first I was getting lots of
*07:55.380- 08:01.660* :  congratulation messages. I didn't know why. Then I remembered that my dad talked about it,
*08:02.120- 08:06.080* :  and I was really, really proud that my mom had won the Nobel Prize.
*08:07.280- 08:13.060* :  I didn't tell everyone. I just told friends. And I told them just as we were going to go outside
*08:13.060- 08:19.080* :  to eat, and they were even happier than I was. And they were really proud for my mom and for me.
*08:19.360- 08:24.060* :  The Nobel Prize is for all the Iranians, and especially for the women activists.
*08:24.880- 08:27.740* :  And I hope things are going to change in Iran now for the better.
*08:28.400- 08:32.500* :  Now to the first of our world records, there was big excitement in our house
*08:32.820- 08:38.120* :  about Kelvin Kiptum smashing the marathon record. My 17-year-old son is a long-distance runner.
*08:38.120- 08:42.620* :  He is gripped by the battle with fellow Kenyan Elliott Kipchoggi to be the greatest
*08:42.620- 08:47.220* :  of all time in the marathon. The biggest surprise wasn't so much that Kiptum managed it.
*08:47.540- 08:52.060* :  More that he managed it in Chicago, which isn't known as one of the world's fastest marathon
*08:52.700- 08:54.160* :  courses. Jacob Evans has more.
*09:02.600- 09:08.120* :  Twelve months ago, he'd never run a marathon before. But now, 23-year-old Kelvin Kiptum
*09:08.120- 09:13.380* :  is the new world record holder. He dominated last week Chicago marathon, finishing the race
*09:13.380- 09:19.000* :  in an astonishing time of two hours and 35 seconds. This beat the previous record set by
*09:19.000- 09:24.260* :  fellow Kenyan Elliott Kiptchoggi by more than 30 seconds. And after the race, he spoke about
*09:24.260- 09:34.020* :  his achievement. I feel so happy. I was prepared. I knew I was coming for a course record,
*09:35.180- 09:40.060* :  but unfortunately, how old it could. Yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm happy.
*09:40.760- 09:45.920* :  In the men's marathon, running under two hours is an elusive feat. It's been done once before,
*09:46.320- 09:51.360* :  four years ago by Kiptchoggi. But that race didn't count as he had runners setting the pace in
*09:51.360- 09:56.880* :  front of him. So could Kiptum be the first to break that barrier too? Ed Caesar wrote a book called
*09:56.880- 10:01.660* :  Two Hours, The Quest for the Impossible, all about the world's best long-distance runners,
*10:02.200- 10:06.860* :  and he found Kiptum's run very impressive. It's a pretty astonishing feat of athleticism.
*10:07.220- 10:12.300* :  I have been privileged to watch a lot of very, very fast marathons in the last few years,
*10:12.640- 10:18.180* :  and he smashed the world record. It's worth thinking about at home how fast it is. Most
*10:18.180- 10:24.120* :  treadmills at local gyms don't go as fast as he ran. It is really unimaginable for most people
*10:24.120- 10:29.580* :  just how quickly this guy's going. And when you see him finishing the race, he's finishing at a sprint
*10:29.800- 10:33.760* :  that, you know, the knees are pumping, you know, he looks like he's flying. I mean, it's just
*10:33.840- 10:38.900* :  incredible. Kiptum grew up in Chepp Corrio, a village in Kenya's Rift Valley, and trained without
*10:38.900- 10:43.700* :  a coach until he was an adult. And it's that pace Ed mentions which is truly mind-boggling.
*10:44.260- 10:50.500* :  Imagine this. You run five kilometres in 14 minutes and 17 seconds, and then repeat that eight
*10:50.500- 10:56.240* :  and a half times. Kiptum's ascendancy in the sport has been incredible, and he may only just
*10:56.240- 11:03.300* :  be getting started. Now to an incredible eco-restoration story, Rodonda, a tiny Caribbean island,
*11:03.300- 11:10.020* :  as part of Antigua and Barbuda, has been transformed from a desolate rock to a thriving wildlife haven
*11:10.020- 11:17.000* :  and in just a few years. Janela Bradshaw is the Rodonda ecosystem reserve coordinator. She told Jackie
*11:17.000- 11:22.660* :  the first step to restore Rodonda's biodiversity was to get rid of the black rats and feral goats.
*11:23.280- 11:29.820* :  I like to call it the superhero restoration team, and they came together with both local
*11:29.820- 11:37.380* :  government agencies, and it also entailed members of the international bodies. It required a lot
*11:37.380- 11:46.660* :  of innovation. It required a lot of partnership. One of the main themes of Rodonda is the power
*11:46.660- 11:52.820* :  of partnership. When you have a group of people come in together and say, hey, we want to restore
*11:52.820- 12:01.160* :  Rodonda, it shows that we can almost achieve anything once we're together. So we had a team over
*12:01.160- 12:07.660* :  there, camping on Rodonda for two months. So there's nothing on Rodonda, there's no source of water,
*12:07.660- 12:15.300* :  there's no wifi, there's no light literally with just rats and goats, and every day they would
*12:15.300- 12:21.960* :  administer bait to ensure that we could remove them from the island. And the goats, they got the
*12:22.100- 12:29.540* :  in-class treatments. The goats had to be airlifted all of Rodonda via helicopter, but the goats,
*12:29.540- 12:35.820* :  they were very smart. It took a long time for the team to capture them. They knew what was going on.
*12:35.820- 12:41.280* :  The goats were like, no, you're not going to get me. So they kind of had to lure the young in,
*12:41.620- 12:45.980* :  and you know, the mother would come, and then the father would be like, but why is my entire
*12:45.980- 12:51.260* :  family over there? And then the father would come, and that's the method that we had to use.
*12:51.900- 12:57.580* :  When you started telling the story of laying the bait for the rats, it sounded a lot like we were
*12:57.580- 13:03.900* :  starting a horror movie, very glad there was a happy ending for the goats because we all quite
*13:03.900- 13:09.340* :  like goats on the happy pod. So which sorts of creatures came back to Rodonda?
*13:09.760- 13:17.760* :  So we have already done their ground dragon. So this is a beautiful black lizard. I love them because
*13:18.000- 13:22.240* :  they're so friendly. And you would think that if you're living on the island and you have never
*13:22.240- 13:27.480* :  interacted with people, you would kind of like stay away. You'd be more cautious, but no, they are
*13:27.480- 13:33.580* :  the opposite. They would come up to you. One of them even stole my earring. No, ask me how it
*13:33.700- 13:37.780* :  achieved that, but it stole my earring. And all I saw it was just running away with this little
*13:37.780- 13:45.220* :  pearl in its mouth. And I was just so astonished. I was lost for words. Also, let's talk about the
*13:45.340- 13:52.480* :  birds because Rodonda is known for all its birds. Cool fact, there were so many birds on Rodonda
*13:52.780- 13:58.680* :  in the past that people said that you couldn't walk on the island without stepping on a bird egg.
*13:58.900- 14:06.500* :  And for me, it's literally mind blowing. It just brings the beauty and the value of Rodonda
*14:06.760- 14:13.140* :  to image. And you can see why we had to restore this island. It's like a scene in a movie that you
*14:13.140- 14:18.800* :  never thought that you would have been able to experience. How important is this scientifically
*14:18.800- 14:23.140* :  and ecologically? I mean, it's obviously extraordinary to have seen this transformation.
*14:23.780- 14:32.000* :  But scientifically, how important is it? Islands are biodiversity hotspots, but also most of the
*14:32.000- 14:39.200* :  extensions of species in this world, they happen on islands. Once we have a healthy functioning
*14:39.340- 14:46.440* :  environment, it increases the resilience for us to battle extreme temperatures,
*14:46.460- 14:53.700* :  pollution, like it increases our ability to fight back and to withstand that. So that's why it's
*14:53.700- 15:02.280* :  so important to preserve our biodiversity because it protects us. When you look at what has been
*15:02.280- 15:07.640* :  achieved, what are your personal reflections? When I was growing up, nobody was ever preaching or
*15:07.640- 15:14.580* :  saying, hey, becoming environmentalist and to know that we can set an example for the upcoming
*15:14.580- 15:21.080* :  generations, like we can do conservation work in the Caribbean and we can make a big difference.
*15:21.720- 15:27.420* :  Jenna, the brand sure the Rodonda ecosystem reserve coordinator. With Halloween fast approaching
*15:27.420- 15:32.960* :  in many countries, it's harvest time for pumpkins. Now, most of them will end up on a doorstep with
*15:32.960- 15:38.220* :  a candle inside with their innards in a pie if they're lucky. Where there are pumpkin growers,
*15:38.220- 15:44.140* :  there are giant pumpkin growers who make it their mission to tend their fruit with gallons of water
*15:44.140- 15:50.800* :  every day to see just how big they can grow. There's then the tricky business of transporting the
*15:50.800- 15:56.680* :  giant pumpkin, the size and weight of a small car to the weighing scales to see whether indeed it
*15:56.680- 16:02.200* :  is a record breaker. Step forward, Travis Ginger from Minnesota in the US, his pumpkin weighed in it
*16:02.540- 16:11.800* :  2,749 pounds or 1,247 kilograms thus breaking the world record for the biggest gourd. So what's his
*16:11.800- 16:16.960* :  secret? I don't really have one. I do a lot of different things to this pumpkin that just
*16:16.960- 16:24.720* :  involve time and good products and good techniques of pruning and weeding and managing the pumpkin
*16:24.720- 16:30.720* :  throughout. I might start three or four plants but I'm quickly down to two plants and then from
*16:30.720- 16:35.600* :  those two plants we'll get two pumpkins and when they start growing sometimes I'll lose one,
*16:35.640- 16:42.560* :  so I'm down to one pretty quick. It's kind of all-in or nothing type of a mentality. Do you talk to it?
*16:44.000- 16:48.720* :  Sometimes I go up to it and hit it like a jockey would a horse and say, hey, come on, we gotta
*16:48.720- 17:01.160* :  start going. And I'm told that it's big enough for 687 pies. Will you be baking 687 pies, Travis?
*17:02.560- 17:07.160* :  No, we'll be carving this thing for the Guinness Book of World Records for surely for the largest
*17:07.160- 17:13.080* :  circumference and then maybe another one as well but it's going to be cool when it's carved. You'll
*17:13.080- 17:19.080* :  have to see the pictures. We most certainly will. It is coming up to Halloween, it's October and one
*17:19.080- 17:25.860* :  of the key elements of it is carved pumpkins, jack o'lantons. Are you yourself any good at carving
*17:25.860- 17:35.200* :  Halloween pumpkins? Terrible. What sort of sense of achievement do you have having broken this record?
*17:36.360- 17:42.760* :  In this record's been held by overseas I will say for 10 years so to get it back in the states
*17:42.760- 17:48.980* :  is super huge but it was 30 years of growing and hard work coming down to one minute there
*17:48.980- 17:56.040* :  and they could have went either way. We could have went home second place or set a world record
*17:56.040- 18:03.340* :  just as easy so it was a lot of excitement and emotion there. Travis Kinga with the world's biggest
*18:03.340- 18:12.880* :  pumpkin. Still to come? We're talking about Fat Bear Week, the annual competition celebrates some
*18:12.880- 18:18.420* :  of the largest brown bears on earth. And how do you celebrate being named the laziest person
*18:18.420- 18:25.220* :  in Montenegro? You know the laziest champion doesn't need to do anything. First a few of the stories
*18:25.220- 18:30.280* :  I wanted to mention. Do you remember the excitement over the capsule containing samples from the
*18:30.280- 18:35.780* :  asteroid Bennu a couple of weeks ago? Now NASA has revealed the first images of what was brought
*18:35.780- 18:42.200* :  back. It says a quarter of the 250 grams of the rock and dust contained carbon and water,
*18:42.620- 18:48.200* :  crucial elements in the evolution of the earth, fundamental to life itself. You might have heard
*18:48.200- 18:53.660* :  about the archaeology student in Scotland whose first ever deep turned up a historically important
*18:53.660- 18:58.720* :  treasure trove. It's thought the coins Lucy Ankers found, very deep beneath a fireplace,
*18:58.720- 19:05.760* :  may have been hidden before the infamous Glenco massacre in 1692. And the safer cover he's
*19:05.760- 19:11.220* :  been reported, a Fred the Pig, who's been detained by Aurora Animal Services in Colorado.
*19:11.260- 19:16.280* :  After a port he'd been causing Mayhem tearing up gardens, wandering around in the traffic
*19:16.280- 19:22.380* :  and hanging around a shopping mall. It took eight people, five hours to catch him. He weighs over
*19:22.380- 19:30.240* :  180 kilos and now needs a forever home. He's been described as social, always hungry and a nice boy.
*19:39.220- 19:43.220* :  What in the world is the podcast helping you make sense of what's happening in the world?
*19:43.340- 19:46.660* :  What in the world is net zero and are we actually on track to achieving it?
*19:46.660- 19:52.020* :  Is the wastewater from Fukushima dangerous? So you can understand more about what in the world is
*19:52.020- 19:56.560* :  going on when you read the daily headlines? Why is there a North Korea and a South Korea?
*19:56.560- 20:01.540* :  Supposed to be temporary. Why is palm oil considered bad? The amount of land for you to grow it?
*20:01.680- 20:06.560* :  What in the world from the BBC World Service? Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*20:09.120- 20:13.760* :  Now a discovery in Spain that could have implications for the early detection of breast cancer.
*20:14.140- 20:19.400* :  Liquid biopsies are already carried out on blood looking for circulating tumor DNA.
*20:19.400- 20:24.620* :  But researchers in Barcelona detected tumor DNA in breast milk and they think the development
*20:24.620- 20:29.640* :  of a liquid biopsy of a mother's milk could be a tool for spotting breast cancer early.
*20:30.200- 20:35.120* :  Christina Sauer is a senior oncologist and she told us the study began when a mother who was pregnant
*20:35.120- 20:41.600* :  again was diagnosed with cancer. She decided to provide us with a breast milk sample that was
*20:41.600- 20:47.300* :  collected 18 months before the breast cancer diagnosis of this patient. The interesting thing
*20:47.300- 20:52.360* :  is that we were able to find in that breast milk sample the same mutations that were
*20:52.360- 20:57.580* :  present in the breast tumor. So what does it mean? What does it told you that we didn't know already?
*20:58.340- 21:05.420* :  So liquid biopsies are collected from blood to detect mutations that are present in different
*21:05.420- 21:13.240* :  tumors. And in this case the liquid biopsy from blood is not yet enough sensitive to detect
*21:13.240- 21:20.020* :  the small amount of CTDNA that is present in the blood for early breast cancer detection.
*21:21.080- 21:26.420* :  And in this project we were able to collect the samples of breast milk and blood samples
*21:26.420- 21:34.220* :  from patients diagnosed of breast cancer during pregnancy. And in 13 hours of 15 patients we were
*21:34.220- 21:40.680* :  able to detect in the breast milk CTDNA and only one patient had the blood positive.
*21:41.520- 21:49.540* :  So the breast milk definitely has more quantity of CTDNA of the tumor present than the blood.
*21:49.900- 21:57.320* :  So we are looking for funding to start a prospective trial with the aim to include 5,000 healthy
*21:57.320- 22:03.700* :  women that are pregnant and a follow-up of the patients during at least two years we will be
*22:03.700- 22:13.020* :  able to answer definitely if the test that we design it's enough sensitive and specific to be used
*22:13.020- 22:19.560* :  as a new tool for early breast cancer detection. Tell us about your reaction, your team's reaction.
*22:20.120- 22:22.840* :  When it became clear that you seem to be on to something.
*22:25.720- 22:32.480* :  It's not one single day. The first time that we analyzed the breast milk sample the results were
*22:32.480- 22:39.680* :  negative but medium sensor. A postdoc in the lab she came back to the same sample with a more
*22:39.680- 22:46.900* :  sensitive technique and then she was able to detect the mutations. So the research it's kind of
*22:46.900- 22:52.680* :  a story of a lot of actors involved. The patient that came to us, the people in the lab, the people
*22:52.680- 22:57.420* :  in the clinic and the results are there due to the effort of all of them.
*22:58.240- 23:04.160* :  It must be very rewarding for you when you find something that could be of use and could help
*23:04.160- 23:10.880* :  generations of women and their families. It is and it's very clear to me when I explained to my
*23:10.880- 23:18.200* :  second child he is 12 years old and asked me mom you work a lot for this grant. If you receive
*23:18.200- 23:25.400* :  the money of these 15 millions of euros how many money will be for you? And I said nothing
*23:25.400- 23:32.640* :  this will be just only for research but perhaps this could help your future wife or your future
*23:32.640- 23:38.760* :  child. So we love to work in these kind of projects and it's very rewarding when you really find
*23:38.760- 23:43.540* :  something that may help to give the humanity the best curve for the future.
*23:44.260- 23:50.200* :  Christina Sarah in Barcelona. You may remember last month we heard about the hunt for Montenegro's
*23:50.480- 23:56.020* :  laziest citizen. The competition was intense but we do now have a winner or actually two winners
*23:56.640- 24:02.820* :  as 23 year olds Lydia Markovich and Philip Kinesovich shared the lazy crown. Boris Kronich
*24:02.820- 24:11.200* :  is one of the organizers. This competition had two winners this year, Lydia and Philip. They
*24:12.680- 24:18.520* :  shared prize and Philip like gentlemen give Lydia the media intention.
*24:19.200- 24:26.260* :  She appears in media and on the televisions. The competition has become more and more popular
*24:26.940- 24:35.720* :  not only in the region but also in all the world. Last year record was five days. This year is
*24:36.220- 24:43.420* :  50 days denier. And from the search for Montenegro's laziest person to Alaska's perfect bear.
*24:43.980- 24:50.080* :  A head of hibernation perfect tends to mean fat. Graser was the winner and as the local park
*24:50.080- 24:56.740* :  service said she has beauty. She has grace stuffing so much salmon in her face. Harry Bly has more.
*24:57.520- 25:02.660* :  Fat bear week. Fat bear week. It's in full swing right now. I kid you not. Fat bear week.
*25:02.740- 25:08.740* :  Fat bear week is here. We're talking about fat bear week. The annual competition celebrates some
*25:08.740- 25:14.840* :  of the largest brown bears on earth. Fat bear week. 2023 has come to an end. Running from the
*25:14.840- 25:20.480* :  fourth to the 10th of October. The contest invites fans from all over the world to vote on their
*25:20.480- 25:26.540* :  favourite of 12 brown bears living around the Brook River in Alaska's Katmai National Park.
*25:26.540- 25:31.960* :  All of which have been eating extraordinary amounts of salmon. This year's winner is bear
*25:31.960- 25:38.160* :  one two eight called grazer known by fans for having a long muzzle conspicuously blonde ears
*25:38.660- 25:46.100* :  and a bodacious body. She's a mother of two cubs or grazes and received more than 108,000 votes
*25:46.100- 25:54.220* :  beating a much larger bear number 32 named chunk. Despite the name it's not all about size as Mike
*25:54.220- 26:00.760* :  Fitz former Ranger and founder of the competition explains. We ask people to vote based on not only
*26:00.760- 26:05.860* :  like body size and who they think got the fattest. We also ask people to consider the stories
*26:06.460- 26:12.880* :  because each bear at Brooks River is an individual and faces its own challenges to survive and thrive
*26:12.880- 26:17.580* :  in this habitat. And of course it's brought to us by the salmon and the rich salmon runs
*26:17.580- 26:23.240* :  that arrive at Brooks River every summer. The National Park Service credited grazer for having
*26:23.240- 26:29.140* :  a combination of skill and toughness making her one of the parks most formidable successful and
*26:29.140- 26:35.040* :  adaptable bears. Grazer was seen to work over time being spotted on the parks infrared cameras
*26:35.040- 26:40.780* :  hunting for fish through the night. She's also known by the park service to regularly confront
*26:40.820- 26:48.140* :  larger male bears to protect her cubs. The competition started in 2014 and since then has become an
*26:48.140- 26:53.740* :  internet sensation with users taking part from all over the world watching their favorite bears on
*26:53.740- 26:58.880* :  the park's webcams. This year's contests are past previous records with more than a million
*26:58.880- 27:05.860* :  votes counted. Harry Blie on fat bear week. And that's all from us for now. If you've got some
*27:05.860- 27:10.060* :  happy news from where you live though or a world record you think we should know about do drop us
*27:10.060- 27:17.100* :  an email. We love hearing from you. It's global podcast at bbc.co.uk. But happy squad this week
*27:17.100- 27:22.700* :  studio manager Chris Hanson produces Anna Murphy in Jacob Evans. Our editor is Karen Martin.
