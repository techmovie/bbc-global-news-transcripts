*00:00.060- 00:03.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:05.620- 00:08.260* :  I'm Rachel Wright, and in the early hours of Sunday,
*00:08.260- 00:11.120* :  the 1st of October, these are our main stories.
*00:11.700- 00:16.760* :  The vast majority of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have fled across the border.
*00:17.320- 00:22.840* :  A last-minute stopgap measure to avoid another U.S. government shutdown and...
*00:30.220- 00:33.980* :  Eyes and humans begin their annual turf war in Australia.
*00:37.100- 00:42.780* :  Also in this podcast, what the election result in the Maldives means for China and India,
*00:43.340- 00:48.120* :  and the unusually super-friendly animal barred from a U.S. baseball stadium.
*00:48.580- 00:50.420* :  He is my emotional support alligator.
*00:50.840- 00:53.720* :  I wake up, he'd be laying on my head, make me fall up.
*00:58.420- 01:02.580* :  The pictures show an endless stream of cars full of people in their possessions.
*01:02.620- 01:08.720* :  Armenian officials say over 100,000 Armenian residents have left Nagorno-Karabakh,
*01:09.060- 01:13.940* :  and enclave surrounded almost entirely by Azerbaijan, except for the one road out.
*01:14.600- 01:19.060* :  Many are still stuck in the endless traffic jam on that one road through the mountains.
*01:19.180- 01:24.720* :  Journalist Srinesh Sarkishyan is one of those waiting to cross the border into Armenia.
*01:25.320- 01:34.540* :  This exodus is unbearable, not only psychologically, as many people here are becoming refugee
*01:35.140- 01:42.060* :  already so time in their lives, but this exodus is also unbearable physically,
*01:42.140- 01:51.280* :  because we already, 60 hours, spend in this road, it seems like we can reach border.
*01:51.900- 01:55.660* :  But once that border is reached, crossing it can be a daunting prospect.
*01:55.680- 02:00.280* :  Gev Iskation and his family were among the lucky ones to have completed the journey
*02:00.280- 02:04.920* :  from the Nagorno-Karabakh's largest city to the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
*02:05.400- 02:07.620* :  Approaching that border is a real center of fear.
*02:07.620- 02:12.900* :  There have been multiple arrests there. That fear of persecution is always there.
*02:13.260- 02:17.820* :  We're actually very thankful for the fact that as soon as we got to the other side,
*02:17.820- 02:23.940* :  there was a score of volunteers. Many of them used that were there to greet the people of
*02:23.940- 02:28.300* :  the Nagorno-Karabakh with food, water, supplies, even fuel.
*02:28.760- 02:33.600* :  Our correspondent, Rayhound Dimitri, has just arrived in the southern Armenian town of Goris
*02:33.920- 02:35.220* :  and described the scene there.
*02:35.940- 02:41.120* :  Well, I'm outside one of the reception points where people have been registering
*02:41.180- 02:47.240* :  for nearly a week now. There's less people now compared to what we've seen at the beginning
*02:47.240- 02:53.400* :  of these exodus, but still dozens of people kind of wandering around. There are lots of mini-bases
*02:53.980- 02:59.300* :  and people are still registering there and then they're being allocated to go to a certain
*03:00.040- 03:06.720* :  minivan and be taken to different parts in Armenia. I was talking to one man. His name is
*03:06.720- 03:12.540* :  Vitaly Safarian. He wanted to tell me his story and he said that a week ago he was on the front line.
*03:12.540- 03:19.440* :  He's a contractor and a military man and he said that he was actually surrounded by a lot of
*03:19.440- 03:25.500* :  Azerbaijanis, but there was no violence or insults and there were Russian peacekeepers that helped him
*03:25.500- 03:31.840* :  to get out of that situation. He said there were about 100 of them and just me alone and he said,
*03:31.840- 03:36.280* :  yes, that it was really scary, but nothing happened. And he said, you know, the clothes that I'm
*03:36.280- 03:40.960* :  wearing, someone just gave it to me. I've got nothing. I didn't even have time to go and get my
*03:40.960- 03:47.080* :  passport. So I think there's still a lot of this uncertainty for people. They're still in a
*03:47.080- 03:51.960* :  state of shock, I would say. And do we know what's going to happen to these refugees? Are they going
*03:51.960- 03:58.080* :  to camps or are they going to stay with relatives? So at the moment, some are going to temporary
*03:58.080- 04:03.520* :  accommodation that was set up by the Armenian government. A vast majority are going to stay with
*04:03.520- 04:09.380* :  their relatives, but it's all kind of temporary measures. And at these stage, since we're so close
*04:09.380- 04:15.420* :  to these crises, it just happened, you know, within the last few days, the long term solution
*04:15.420- 04:21.060* :  is really not clear. But we know that aid is coming to Armenia. We know that the UK government pledged
*04:21.060- 04:27.060* :  one million pounds today. And on top of that, more aid from the Western countries to help Armenia
*04:27.060- 04:33.940* :  deal with these crises. Rayhanda Mitri in the Armenian town of Goris. The U.S. House of
*04:33.940- 04:38.500* :  Representatives may have just bought themselves more time to prevent a government shutdown.
*04:38.540- 04:43.640* :  A temporary bill has been passed to keep the government running for a further 45 days.
*04:44.260- 04:48.860* :  It's a last-ditch measure that is now in the hands of the Senate before they can avoid
*04:48.860- 04:54.240* :  disruption to hundreds of thousands of bin collectors, air traffic controllers and the military.
*04:54.240- 05:00.420* :  The Republican Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, is the architect of the bill and has been under intense
*05:00.420- 05:06.600* :  pressure from members of Congress from his own side. Winston Churchill once said this about America.
*05:06.600- 05:10.940* :  You can always count on Americans to do what's right after they exhausted every other option.
*05:11.220- 05:17.060* :  It is very clear that I tried every possible way, listening to every single person in the conference.
*05:17.060- 05:21.040* :  When we went to vote on a probe bills, you didn't think we could pass? We passed them.
*05:21.160- 05:25.040* :  Would I have won it? The bill we put on the floor yesterday that would secure our border,
*05:25.320- 05:29.560* :  cut wasteful spending, yes I did. But I had some members in our own conference. It wouldn't vote for that.
*05:30.100- 05:35.800* :  But the plan does not include money for the war in Ukraine, a source of contention for Democrats.
*05:36.500- 05:40.400* :  Shortly before recording this podcast, I got an update from Sean Dilly,
*05:40.400- 05:42.720* :  our North America correspondent in Washington.
*05:43.080- 05:47.160* :  Oh my goodness, it's difficult to even follow it. My head is spinning. It didn't look like a deal
*05:47.160- 05:51.220* :  was going to be possible at lunchtime. It looked like there was so much division so that
*05:51.220- 05:56.640* :  Democratic and Republican members of the House of Representatives were not going to reach a deal.
*05:56.640- 06:00.360* :  It was a slight surprise they did because they tried to pass their own separate deal yesterday
*06:00.360- 06:04.640* :  that cut much deeper, about 30 percent, for example, off of Social Security funding.
*06:04.640- 06:08.800* :  And they wanted to introduce very strong border controls that simply wouldn't have been
*06:08.800- 06:14.160* :  acceptable to Democratic senators. Hardliners around nine of them in the Republican Party
*06:14.160- 06:20.320* :  had made it clear that if Kevin McCarthy, their own speaker, attempted to lean on Democratic support
*06:20.320- 06:24.780* :  to get through a deal that the upper chamber, the Senate had already agreed, that would be something
*06:24.780- 06:28.760* :  that would force them to remove Kevin McCarthy from office. Now I don't know if you've seen
*06:28.760- 06:34.020* :  the Netflix House of Cards, the British one or the American one. This is right out of one of
*06:34.020- 06:38.220* :  those plot lines. At the moment, I mean, you can never quite tell, but it looks like the Senate
*06:38.220- 06:42.800* :  will rubber stamp this. It will look like the 45 days of funding continues, but then it begins
*06:42.800- 06:47.880* :  an almighty argument about funding for Ukraine and the message that sends to Kiev and then
*06:48.000- 06:52.380* :  even leaving that to one side. It's sort of kicking it down the road again. We might see all
*06:52.380- 06:58.500* :  this again come thanks given. Sean Dilly in Washington. Today, Robert Fizo stood to become the
*06:58.500- 07:04.120* :  Slovak Prime Minister for the third time, and his left-wing populist smur party was leading in
*07:04.120- 07:09.280* :  the polls in advance of the general election, but he faced a strong challenge from the progressive
*07:09.280- 07:14.960* :  party. Ukraine was one of the issues of contention with Mr Fizo saying he would end military aid
*07:14.960- 07:21.500* :  to Ukraine while his opponent publicly supports Kiev. The first exit polls were released shortly
*07:21.500- 07:27.540* :  before we started recording this podcast, a correspondent Rob Cameron, who's in the region, told me more.
*07:27.980- 07:34.580* :  That original exit poll really produced a shock result, that Progressive Slovakia, the liberal
*07:34.580- 07:41.500* :  pro-Western party, which had began nipping at the heels of Robert Fizo and his populist smur
*07:41.500- 07:49.300* :  party in recent weeks and days, appears that they have won the election. It was just an exit poll,
*07:49.300- 07:54.960* :  but another exit poll has now been released confirming this. We have two exit polls suggesting
*07:54.960- 08:00.680* :  that Progressive Slovakia and not Robert Fizo's smur party has won this election, but it's
*08:00.680- 08:05.480* :  going to be a long night ahead, but obviously he's just been counted now, and we're just getting
*08:05.480- 08:11.220* :  the first results in. But certainly a surprise, and one I think that will be welcomed in some quarters
*08:11.220- 08:17.020* :  in the West, in NATO and in the EU. Indeed, what were the main issues for voters in this election?
*08:17.440- 08:21.980* :  Well, Ukraine obviously was one of them, it wasn't the only issue, but of course it was, and that was
*08:22.080- 08:28.520* :  because it was brought to the fore by a Mr Fizo fundering that he wouldn't send a single round of
*08:28.520- 08:34.040* :  ammunition to Ukraine if he were elected. But there were lots of other issues too, the cost of living
*08:34.040- 08:40.460* :  crisis, pensions and the state of the health service and the poor quality of university education,
*08:40.460- 08:46.600* :  17% of Slovak high school graduates leave the country every year and study abroad and half of
*08:46.600- 08:52.140* :  them never come back. And that produces a real brain drain for this country of five and a half
*08:52.140- 08:56.240* :  million people. And that's one of the things that this Liberal Party Progressive Slovakia
*08:56.500- 09:02.420* :  wants to stop to woo those people to come back, saying that there is a future for young Slovaks who
*09:02.420- 09:07.900* :  believe in their country's membership of the EU and NATO and want an inclusive, liberal,
*09:07.900- 09:13.520* :  tolerant, progressive society. They seem to have won the upper hand in this election,
*09:13.520- 09:19.440* :  but of course the real hard work of coalition building, creating a new government, that's just
*09:19.440- 09:25.940* :  beginning. Rob Cameron. The cost of storm Daniel, which devastated the centre of Greece in early
*09:25.940- 09:32.300* :  September is continuing to be counted. The resulting floods killed more than 200,000 animals
*09:32.700- 09:37.520* :  and destroyed around a fifth of the country's cotton crop, as well as damaging the season's
*09:37.520- 09:43.200* :  corn and fruit trees. It's believed the short-term effect alone could cost the Greek economy up to
*09:43.200- 09:49.340* :  five billion dollars. One of the worst hit areas is a Thessaly plain, one of the country's main
*09:49.340- 09:55.640* :  agricultural regions raising fears about the impact on food production. Bethany Bell reports from
*09:55.640- 10:02.160* :  Karl Ditzer region in Thessaly. Who's in my house? All, all water, all, all, all, all.
*10:02.400- 10:08.300* :  Anthela shows me around the wreck of her home. The house, like many others in this village of
*10:08.300- 10:16.460* :  Lachos, was almost totally submerged in water. Here, it's my bedroom here. Oh my goodness.
*10:17.940- 10:26.660* :  Mud thick on the ground. Smells horrible. On the roof of the house next door you can see the rotting
*10:26.660- 10:33.140* :  carcass of a dead sheep. Must have been swept there by the floodwaters. And Thula's daughter Maria
*10:33.140- 10:38.560* :  says they've been abandoned by the authorities. Nothing from the government, nothing from the
*10:38.800- 10:44.020* :  mayor, nothing, nothing, nothing at all. It's terrible. This is Greece, not the island,
*10:44.980- 10:49.140* :  not the blue sea, not the blue sky. This is Greece.
*10:53.280- 10:58.640* :  Greece's Prime Minister Kiryakos Mitsubtak is promising speedy aid for the victims of the
*10:58.640- 11:07.940* :  flooding. But many people here say it's simply not enough. In the village of Lefki,
*11:07.940- 11:14.340* :  Thannis's thodos shows me what's left of his walnut tree orchard. He had about a thousand
*11:14.340- 11:21.720* :  trees here and he's lost half of them. The ground is scattered with dead and decaying trees,
*11:21.900- 11:29.620* :  brown leaves, dusty and dead. The question is how much a state will be able to help us with
*11:29.620- 11:35.260* :  a compensation because our equipment has also been damaged. All I can think about is my toil,
*11:35.460- 11:41.600* :  my sweat and my suffering for the last 10 years. That's all I can see right now. I try to do
*11:41.600- 11:48.140* :  something good, but my dreams have been shot. The Rector of Greece's agricultural university
*11:48.140- 11:54.300* :  Spiroskincios says that while it is possible to replant crops like cereals and cotton within
*11:54.300- 12:00.380* :  the next few months, restoring orchards and herds of sheep and goats will take longer. He says
*12:00.380- 12:08.360* :  supporting local communities is crucial. We have now damages in housing, infrastructure and also
*12:08.960- 12:14.940* :  municipiality, services, roads, schools, primary health units and so on. If we don't manage
*12:15.720- 12:21.160* :  to restore them as soon as possible, then we'll have the problem that the people will have to
*12:21.160- 12:27.160* :  go somewhere else and be excited to leave. If the population, the local population, cannot stay there,
*12:27.160- 12:31.560* :  then we cannot relaunch the agricultural production. In the village of Koskina,
*12:31.560- 12:37.420* :  they miss a Pustalakis and his father a Pustalis, try to kickstart their tractor. They say they've
*12:37.420- 12:43.400* :  lost this year's cotton and corn crops. They miss as the future looks grim. Our lives have changed
*12:43.400- 12:50.900* :  dramatically and the only thing that we could save is ourselves. Do you think you have a future
*12:50.900- 12:58.400* :  building again with agriculture here? No. The water is now polluted by the oil. I don't know what we can
*12:58.780- 13:07.360* :  rebuild again. I don't know. Ethony Bell with that report. Don't run and think about
*13:07.360- 13:12.860* :  donning a hard hat. This is some of the sobering advice given to Aussies each spring to protect
*13:12.860- 13:18.980* :  themselves from swooping Australian magpies. The birds are known to attack humans on the ground as
*13:18.980- 13:24.840* :  they protect their nests during breeding season, which is August to October. This is a sound of one
*13:24.840- 13:30.400* :  unfortunate boy being repeatedly pecked and harangued by a swooping magpie while riding his
*13:30.400- 13:33.380* :  scooter in New South Wales. His dad was recording.
*13:43.180- 13:48.840* :  Ornithologist insists not all Australian magpies attack humans and they are in fact a clever
*13:48.840- 13:55.480* :  species. The BBC's Tiffany Turnbull is in Sydney and spoke to Valerie Sanderson about some people's
*13:55.480- 14:02.400* :  experiences with magpies in Australia. Just last week a cyclist was in the news after he came
*14:02.400- 14:08.740* :  out and told his story and he was left partially blinded by a magpie attack. He says that the magpie
*14:08.740- 14:13.520* :  flew down out of nowhere, pecked him in the eye, did a backflip and then pecked him in the eye again
*14:14.300- 14:19.900* :  and so he was left needing major surgery to insert a prosthetic islands. But it's not just him,
*14:19.900- 14:25.840* :  we do tend to see cases like this every year or two and people have actually also been known to
*14:25.840- 14:31.680* :  have died while trying to escape magpie attacks. There have been three deaths in about the last decade,
*14:32.340- 14:37.820* :  including a really shocking case in 2021 where a mother who was trying to run away from the birds
*14:37.980- 14:45.360* :  fell and her daughter died, her newborn daughter. They say that magpies only attack when provoked and
*14:45.360- 14:51.340* :  it's important to note that only a few of the male magpies do swoop and only ever during
*14:51.340- 14:56.240* :  breeding season when they're protecting their nests. Some estimates say as little is about 10%
*14:56.300- 15:03.020* :  of magpie swoop and they only ever do it if provoked. But the problem is that really simple things
*15:03.600- 15:08.960* :  like running through their territory or riding a bike through their territory can trigger them
*15:10.280- 15:17.100* :  and what actions are being taken to try to avoid people being hurt and indeed magpies attacking.
*15:17.480- 15:22.380* :  Authorities each year are now putting up signs wherever they see a nest warning people.
*15:22.460- 15:29.280* :  It's advice like don't run, carry an umbrella, traveling groups, but basically just avoid
*15:29.280- 15:34.460* :  the area if you can. Some Australian states have even set up apps where people can now report
*15:34.460- 15:39.640* :  whether there's a nest or a problem magpie so that you can check if there are any swooping
*15:39.640- 15:45.380* :  magpies on your route. So really the advice is try to avoid them, but if that's just not possible
*15:45.380- 15:50.120* :  experts say you can actually make friends with them. So they suggest giving them a little bit of
*15:50.120- 15:54.600* :  food like a tiny piece of bread or a little bit of meat is kind of a piece offering.
*15:55.220- 16:02.620* :  I see they're also suggesting that you wear protective gear and even something called a magpie hat.
*16:02.620- 16:10.140* :  What is that? Magpie hats are an Australian tradition. Growing up often your parents will sit
*16:10.140- 16:15.540* :  down and you'll have a bit of fun making a magpie hat. They used to be plastic ice cream containers
*16:15.540- 16:21.360* :  and you draw eyes on them or you'd stick some eyes on them. But these days people are getting really
*16:21.360- 16:27.380* :  creative. I've seen some ones where people have read up party poppers to their hats and so they
*16:27.380- 16:32.460* :  blow those when the magpie gets close. And we've even seen some people gluing fake magpies to
*16:32.460- 16:41.180* :  their hats to ward off any real ones. Tiffany Turnbull. Still to come on the global news podcast.
*16:43.380- 16:49.280* :  This video shot in an Indian city after dark shows a man and a woman being forced from their
*16:49.280- 16:57.120* :  motorbike by a mob. She is Muslim. He's Hindu. A special report into harassment of interfaith couples
*17:06.660- 17:11.440* :  in India. It's one year since Russia's illegal annexation of four Ukrainian territories,
*17:11.440- 17:18.240* :  a decision that sparked almost universal condemnation. President Putin defended the move and claimed
*17:18.240- 17:24.540* :  that Russia had become stronger for it. But Russia is not even in full control of the four regions
*17:24.540- 17:31.340* :  it claimed to have annexed. Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaparija and Hassan. And more than a year and a half
*17:31.340- 17:37.000* :  after its full scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia appears no closer to winning the war there.
*17:37.000- 17:43.200* :  From Moscow, our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports. One year ago, the Kremlin leader
*17:43.200- 17:50.100* :  proclaimed the annexation of Ukrainian land. Four regions of the country under partial Russian
*17:55.220- 17:59.760* :  occupation. Today, Vladimir Putin claimed that Russia had become stronger because of it.
*18:00.520- 18:06.220* :  Together he said we can meet any challenge. But only two countries have recognized the
*18:06.220- 18:13.060* :  annexation, Syria and North Korea. Perhaps that's why the anniversary celebrations here have been
*18:13.060- 18:22.580* :  slightly muted. There was a large-scale highly choreographed patriotic concert on Red Square,
*18:22.620- 18:31.940* :  but the president stayed away. Pensioner Yelena went along though. We have restored part of our
*18:31.940- 18:40.320* :  historic motherland. Yelena tells me. But these territories are Ukraine, I reply? No, they're Russia.
*18:40.960- 18:46.460* :  Only Russia, she retorts. Our sons have been fighting to get their land back.
*18:48.460- 18:55.760* :  That is exactly how the Kremlin wants Russians to feel that somehow the war in Ukraine is just
*18:55.760- 19:01.000* :  and right. The Russia is succeeding and expanding.
*19:02.080- 19:07.240* :  Steve Rosenberg. In May have a population of just half a million people,
*19:07.740- 19:12.660* :  but its strategic position in the Indian Ocean makes the Maldives strategically important
*19:12.660- 19:18.960* :  for two superpowers, India and China. That's why the presidential election there matters so much.
*19:19.640- 19:25.040* :  And on Saturday it was confirmed that the pro-China opposition candidate has been victorious.
*19:25.040- 19:30.340* :  He emerged as the surprise frontrunner during the first round of voting in September.
*19:30.960- 19:35.480* :  I asked our South Asia regional editors, Lypa Kapelum, what this might mean.
*19:36.120- 19:42.060* :  The current government has actively sought to strengthen ties with India for a very long time
*19:42.060- 19:47.120* :  and the opposition force actually pressed the government to weaken such ties or even end
*19:47.120- 19:52.280* :  India's military presence altogether. So the main issue dominating the India-China debate is
*19:52.280- 19:58.240* :  actually India's controversial military presence in the Maldives and Muiz's party amplified
*19:58.240- 20:05.920* :  an India out campaign. The opposition party expanded the appeal, the India out appeal beyond
*20:05.920- 20:12.840* :  the capital Mali to outer islands and the opposition addressed India's relationship with the Maldives
*20:12.840- 20:17.980* :  with a range of emotions. It used nationalistic fervor against the India's power,
*20:17.980- 20:23.980* :  India's control, India's cloud, both political and economic and calling this like crimes of the
*20:23.980- 20:29.620* :  government that might reduce the Maldives to being a slave to India. And ethnically are the people
*20:29.620- 20:35.540* :  of the Maldives, India. The Maldives has been connected to India in cultural, ethnic and economic
*20:35.540- 20:41.220* :  times for centuries. Some Maldives come from southern India and the origins of the language,
*20:41.220- 20:47.300* :  the vehi, goes back all the way to Sanskrit and Pali and Maldives have long traded with India
*20:47.300- 20:53.160* :  historically and the love in the music and many study in India. But now this is going to be
*20:53.160- 20:57.980* :  a big change then. There's going to be more of a relationship with China. What does that mean?
*20:58.300- 21:03.720* :  When they were in power during 2013 to 2018, during those five years, they built
*21:04.160- 21:09.760* :  substantially strong relationship with China and borrowed quite heavily under the Belt and Road
*21:09.760- 21:14.360* :  Initiative Program, Infrastructure Program. Both Beijing and Delhi, we know are vying to kind of
*21:14.360- 21:19.440* :  influence the region and Beijing is obviously celebrating because the old connection between
*21:19.440- 21:25.560* :  2013 and 2018 can be renewed now, you know. Is it likely that the Indian military presence
*21:25.560- 21:31.100* :  in the Maldives will end? Well, despite China's influence being re-established in the region,
*21:31.100- 21:36.560* :  I do not think that India's influence is going to go away. It has been the dominant regional power
*21:36.720- 21:43.200* :  and also because until recently, India's neighborhood first policy was completely applied to
*21:43.500- 21:47.700* :  Maldivian foreign policy and this was the main component as you know of the Indian Prime Minister,
*21:47.760- 21:51.200* :  Nairindra Modi's foreign policy. Lippika Pellum
*21:51.980- 21:57.720* :  Videos from across India showing interfaith couples being harassed and in some cases assaulted
*21:57.720- 22:04.220* :  by mobs of men are going viral on social media. The attacks appear to have been triggered by claims
*22:04.260- 22:11.140* :  that Hindu men are trying to seduce Muslim women as part of a sinister conspiracy to lure them away
*22:11.140- 22:16.560* :  from their communities. The BBC's Shruti Menum has been trying to find out if the claims
*22:16.560- 22:25.940* :  have any merit. This video, shot in an Indian city after dark, shows a man and a woman being
*22:25.940- 22:34.100* :  forced from their motorbike by a mob. She is Muslim, he is Hindu. The mob, which seems to be made
*22:34.100- 22:42.200* :  up of Muslim men, are heckling her and beating him. The exact circumstances are unclear,
*22:42.840- 22:47.640* :  but it's one of many others that follow a similar pattern going viral online.
*22:48.500- 22:55.040* :  The accounts pushing them bear the same phrase, Bhagwala of Trap. Bhagwala is being used as
*22:55.040- 23:01.960* :  shorthand for extreme right-wing Hindu supremacists. Hindus are trying to seduce Muslim women,
*23:01.960- 23:09.260* :  the theory goes and lure them away from their communities. Who believes it? Mostly Muslim men.
*23:09.260- 23:15.240* :  They are behind the social media accounts spreading the rumor. I spoke to one of them who wanted
*23:15.240- 23:22.260* :  to remain anonymous. This is an actor's voice. This has been going on for years. Hindu boys befriend
*23:22.260- 23:28.820* :  Muslim girls and entrap them in love. When they've had enough, the Muslim girls are forced to suffer.
*23:29.500- 23:36.180* :  It's a conspiracy. Whatever you make of the theory, that point will resonate with anyone who's
*23:36.180- 23:41.860* :  been watching Indian politics for the last decade. He pointed me to this video as evidence.
*23:48.280- 23:54.020* :  This is Yogi Adityanath, a mid-ranking politician speaking 16 years ago.
*23:54.780- 24:01.060* :  You can hear him shouting, if they take one Hindu girl, we'll take at least 100 Muslim girls.
*24:05.060- 24:10.640* :  Today, he's risen to become the chief minister for the state of Uttar Pradesh and a senior member
*24:10.640- 24:17.360* :  of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, the BJP. We asked him if he still stood by the statement,
*24:17.360- 24:24.580* :  he did not reply. I asked a right-wing Hindu leader, Alok Kumar, what he thought of the theory
*24:24.580- 24:32.500* :  and that clip. With all that is in my knowledge, there is absolutely no evidence of such a
*24:32.500- 24:37.940* :  trap being run by Hindus. Alok Kumar says he hasn't seen the Yogi Adityanath speech,
*24:38.420- 24:43.720* :  but that either way, statements like these don't represent the views of most Hindus.
*24:44.680- 24:49.900* :  He is more concerned about another theory, much older and much better known.
*24:51.520- 24:57.440* :  Muslim men being threatened, harassed and beaten. They've been accused of love jihad,
*24:57.440- 25:03.600* :  seducing Hindu women with the aim of converting them to Islam. It's a conspiracy theory that's
*25:03.660- 25:11.000* :  everywhere in India. Love jihad, the idea that Muslim men are trying to seduce Hindu women.
*25:11.740- 25:18.300* :  Essentially, the reverse of the Bhagwa love trap, it's an idea that has gained a lot of
*25:18.300- 25:24.040* :  currency in recent years. We've looked through some of the evidence on offer for both theories.
*25:24.740- 25:30.640* :  Investigations into allegations of love jihad in Uttar Pradesh carried out by two prominent
*25:30.640- 25:37.700* :  Indian news outlets did not provide convincing evidence for the theory. While reliable evidence is
*25:37.700- 25:45.780* :  scant or at least inconclusive, one thing seems clear. This is very much a story of India's
*25:45.780- 25:52.460* :  divisions in 2023. A heavy mix of religious tension and gender politics to boot.
*25:53.200- 25:58.600* :  It's proving fertile ground for theories like these to flourish online and spill over into
*25:58.600- 26:04.620* :  real-world harm. The BBC's Shruti Menum reporting and you can hear the full story on BBC
*26:04.620- 26:10.400* :  trending this weekend on the World Service will listen online just search for BBC trending.
*26:11.460- 26:16.880* :  Imagine a United States in which large parts of the country remain majority Native American.
*26:17.460- 26:22.960* :  That's what the writer Francis Spuford author of the award-winning Golden Hill has done for his
*26:22.960- 26:30.040* :  latest novel, Cahokia Jazz. Cahokia is a real place outside St Louis, Missouri and this is a
*26:30.040- 26:36.200* :  murder mystery which also takes in music, hence the jazz in the title and the spread of disease.
*26:36.840- 26:41.460* :  Michelle Hussein asked him why he decided to set the book in this particular setting.
*26:42.100- 26:48.840* :  Because it was extraordinarily a thriving medieval city in North America and is therefore
*26:48.840- 26:55.340* :  a kind of image for what was lost in the Colombian catastrophe. When the conquistador de Soto went
*26:55.340- 27:00.320* :  out the Mississippi he found it densely populated with people with sort of big towns on both banks and
*27:00.320- 27:05.080* :  then all of that had gone ravaged by European diseases in the next couple of hundred years and
*27:05.080- 27:11.480* :  I wanted to ask what it would have been like if there'd been so many Native Americans that the
*27:11.480- 27:16.100* :  United States had to reckon with them and couldn't push them onto reservations and couldn't
*27:16.100- 27:22.860* :  push them to the margins of the national story. And in my book The City of Cahokia still has an
*27:22.860- 27:29.180* :  ancient core but it's 1922 and it's surrounded by canaries and factory chimneys and there's jazz
*27:29.180- 27:34.480* :  echoing in its streets. Is this successful hybrid? How does disease come into it?
*27:34.740- 27:41.560* :  Because the changing point is that it was the less drastic form of smallpox that arrived in the
*27:41.560- 27:47.940* :  new world first which confers immunity against reinfection and kills about 1% of its victims
*27:47.940- 27:53.540* :  rather than 30%. Native American populations are the estimates very wildly but from tens of
*27:53.540- 27:59.340* :  millions on up crashed. Often before they'd laid eyes on a single white person just because the
*27:59.340- 28:04.480* :  germs had got their first. That's the pretext for the book. It's the excuse for writing something
*28:04.480- 28:11.320* :  that is basically a kind of remix of American history or a sort of jazz improvisation on it.
*28:11.520- 28:17.240* :  I'd read about medieval Cahokia and I'd never heard of it and I was astonished by its scale
*28:17.240- 28:24.240* :  and sophistication and thought, what if it had continued the way that Mexico City has
*28:24.660- 28:29.860* :  continued? For example, what if instead of being this bear and rather melancholy archaeological
*28:29.860- 28:36.140* :  site which I've visited in the depths of winter, what if it was the center of the kind of energetic
*28:36.140- 28:42.280* :  optimistic early 20th century American city? Optimistic is interesting because as we were talking
*28:42.280- 28:48.580* :  about alternative histories and maybe think about that man in the high castle, that book and then
*28:48.580- 28:54.380* :  TV series where the Nazis win the war and are in power in the States. But you imagine a better
*28:54.380- 29:00.800* :  society than America in the 1920s where Native Americans had developed a good relationship with
*29:00.800- 29:05.540* :  white settlers? Well, I think on tougher terms than that. The great thing about alternative
*29:05.540- 29:11.500* :  history is it's very good for exploring what the stakes were in big historical changes. So you
*29:11.500- 29:17.320* :  can do moral disasters like the Nazis winning, but you can also look at ways in which it could have
*29:17.320- 29:22.340* :  been better, which has the sly effect of making history seem less inevitable. And Cahokia jazz
*29:22.600- 29:29.340* :  is an ambiguous and rather gory utopia in which even righteous power turns out to be served by some
*29:29.340- 29:35.260* :  very unrighteous means, but still a better place than the one we had. And it's supposed to be a
*29:35.260- 29:41.780* :  sly, ironic reminder that the tragic things in American history and all our history are perhaps
*29:41.780- 29:48.200* :  not quite as inevitable as all that. Francis Spuford speaking to Michelle Hussain about his latest book
*29:48.200- 29:55.200* :  Cahokia jazz. And we end on the story of Wally, an alligator rescued from Disney World in Florida
*29:55.200- 30:01.500* :  seven years ago, who was turned around the life of his owner, Joe Henney. They go everywhere together,
*30:01.500- 30:08.360* :  even major league baseball games. Joe needs Wally for his support, but the Philadelphia Phillies weren't
*30:08.360- 30:14.640* :  quite so keen as the newsrooms Daniel Mann reports. Think of emotional support animals and dogs,
*30:14.640- 30:21.460* :  cats and rabbits inevitably spring to mind. Think of a one and a half meter alligator and panic sets in.
*30:21.460- 30:27.240* :  But not if its name is Wally, whose owner is Joe Henney. He is my emotional support alligator.
*30:27.500- 30:30.920* :  I'll get lonely and stuff they got there. And he seems to sense that stuff, and you'll come up
*30:30.920- 30:36.140* :  and give me a hug and I bleed on the couch and I wake up, he'd be laying on my head, makes me full of.
*30:36.280- 30:42.280* :  Joe speaking to CBS News last year at his home in Pennsylvania was filmed putting his hand into Wally's
*30:42.280- 30:48.140* :  mouth even rubbing its tongue. Wally didn't bite its owner, who doesn't keep the alligator in a cage
*30:48.140- 30:53.840* :  and takes him everywhere on a leash. So Joe decided to take Wally to the ballgame in Philadelphia.
*30:54.620- 30:59.560* :  A fan of the Philadelphia Phillies, he wanted Wally to lend them his support in their match against
*30:59.560- 31:05.760* :  the Pittsburgh Pirates. Security refused, though if Joe's emotional support animal had been a cat,
*31:05.760- 31:10.940* :  a parrot or a pig, they would have still been denied entry. As Citizens Bank Park Stadium
*31:11.300- 31:17.220* :  only allow service dogs for guests with special needs. Wally is, according to Joe, famous for his
*31:17.220- 31:22.880* :  hugs and outside the stadium, one super Phillies fan who calls himself the Philly Captain on X,
*31:22.880- 31:38.100* :  found Wally making a new friend. So will the Phillies have a change of heart and let Wally in?
*31:38.100- 31:42.960* :  He could even be their new mascot. Their current one is the Philly Fanatic, a furry,
*31:42.960- 31:48.080* :  flightless bird who also happens to be large and green with an extendable tongue.
