*01:10.500- 01:12.580* :  I'm Nick Karaci and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:12.580- 01:15.100* :  the 24th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:15.580- 01:17.720* :  Two elderly women abducted by Hamas
*01:17.720- 01:20.360* :  during its attack on Israel this month have been released.
*01:21.000- 01:23.740* :  An Israeli government minister has warned the militant group
*01:23.740- 01:27.340* :  the decision won't stop his country's forces moving into Gaza.
*01:28.240- 01:30.400* :  In other news, climate scientists have warned
*01:30.420- 01:32.620* :  that even if carbon emissions are cut,
*01:33.160- 01:37.940* :  the giant West Antarctic ice sheet will melt raising sea levels.
*01:41.020- 01:41.980* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:42.400- 01:46.860* :  Bobby is an easygoing, very laid back, very happy dog
*01:46.860- 01:50.420* :  that has had this abundant life living outside,
*01:50.420- 01:54.400* :  eating fresh food in a very low stress, happy environment.
*01:54.800- 01:59.640* :  That was then Bobby, the world's oldest dog, has died at the age of 31.
*02:03.840- 02:08.800* :  Hamas militants in Gaza have released two elderly female hostages
*02:09.200- 02:11.340* :  seized during the group's deadly rampage
*02:11.340- 02:13.240* :  through southern Israel earlier this month.
*02:13.240- 02:17.140* :  It says the move follows mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt.
*02:17.640- 02:19.380* :  The women freed her, been named in Israel
*02:19.380- 02:23.780* :  as Nuret Cooper and your heavy lift shits, both in their 80s.
*02:24.040- 02:27.560* :  The Hamas video shows them being handed over to representatives
*02:27.560- 02:29.860* :  from the International Committee of the Red Cross.
*02:30.420- 02:32.380* :  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams,
*02:32.380- 02:35.820* :  his inter-Russelam, has been looking at the footage of their release.
*02:36.320- 02:38.040* :  And what footage it is, too?
*02:38.560- 02:40.920* :  First of all, we've seen them in ambulances
*02:41.480- 02:44.320* :  and pictures broadcast on Egyptian television.
*02:44.880- 02:47.160* :  They were delivered across the border into Egypt
*02:47.160- 02:50.340* :  and then I think immediately driven a short distance
*02:50.400- 02:51.900* :  to the Israeli border.
*02:51.900- 02:54.600* :  But then Hamas released a video,
*02:54.600- 02:56.260* :  just as they did a few days ago
*02:56.520- 02:58.340* :  when they released the first two hostages.
*02:59.040- 03:02.860* :  And in that video, you see the moment the two elderly ladies
*03:02.860- 03:08.420* :  were actually handed over by Maast Hamas Gunman to the ICRC,
*03:08.420- 03:10.180* :  the International Committee of the Red Cross.
*03:10.700- 03:14.900* :  And just at that moment, your heavy turns to the Maast gunman,
*03:15.540- 03:19.420* :  shakes his hand and says Shalom before getting in the ambulance.
*03:19.660- 03:22.260* :  I mean, it's a kind of remarkable scene.
*03:22.660- 03:26.900* :  Clearly, this is a highly delicate and highly charged process.
*03:27.760- 03:30.720* :  And it may well be that at some point,
*03:31.340- 03:34.680* :  the Qataris felt that they were going to be able to deliver
*03:34.680- 03:37.040* :  a much bigger group of hostages.
*03:37.040- 03:40.160* :  More than 50, we thought, until early this evening,
*03:40.720- 03:42.060* :  that all seemed to go away.
*03:42.060- 03:44.080* :  And officials in Qatar said,
*03:44.080- 03:46.600* :  no, no, no, we're just talking about two.
*03:47.060- 03:48.980* :  And interestingly, the two in question
*03:48.980- 03:52.380* :  are two who were mentioned two days ago by Hamas,
*03:52.380- 03:55.100* :  who said they wanted to deliver them to Israel,
*03:55.100- 03:57.780* :  but that Israel was not interested in receiving them.
*03:57.820- 03:59.600* :  That was a report, the Israelis at the time,
*03:59.600- 04:01.320* :  described as mendacious.
*04:01.440- 04:04.880* :  So I think you get a little glimpse into the kind of tussle,
*04:04.880- 04:06.200* :  the battle of wills.
*04:06.700- 04:10.200* :  And I think this is a pretty unbearable situation
*04:10.200- 04:12.640* :  for the Netanyahu government to be in,
*04:12.640- 04:15.240* :  because it wants to get on with its military business in Gaza.
*04:15.280- 04:18.400* :  And that's going to involve at some point a ground invasion.
*04:18.900- 04:21.800* :  But as long as this groundswell of popular opinion
*04:22.260- 04:24.260* :  and international opinion, it mounts.
*04:24.420- 04:26.120* :  It's very difficult for the government
*04:26.120- 04:27.460* :  to know quite how to proceed.
*04:27.460- 04:30.120* :  And clearly, Hamas is playing on that.
*04:30.860- 04:33.900* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem, the International Committee
*04:33.900- 04:37.280* :  of the Red Cross, said it had facilitated the release
*04:37.280- 04:40.880* :  by transporting the women out of Gaza on Monday evening.
*04:41.140- 04:42.980* :  Luis Vaughn Jones spoke to Stephen Ryan
*04:42.980- 04:45.260* :  from the ICRC in Jerusalem.
*04:45.780- 04:48.500* :  What I can say right now is that the International Committee
*04:48.500- 04:50.960* :  of the Red Cross is relieved that two more people
*04:51.300- 04:52.900* :  are able to return to their families.
*04:53.200- 04:56.620* :  This underscores the neutral intermediary role
*04:56.620- 04:58.540* :  that the International Committee of the Red Cross
*04:58.540- 05:00.000* :  can play in arms complex.
*05:00.540- 05:02.160* :  And certainly, while we're delighted
*05:02.160- 05:03.980* :  that two more people are safely home,
*05:04.660- 05:07.720* :  we continue to call for the release of the remaining hostages
*05:07.840- 05:10.820* :  and to continue to call for access to be able to visit them.
*05:11.100- 05:13.540* :  Actually, and can you tell us anything about the process,
*05:13.540- 05:17.380* :  about what goes on, how does this actually physically happen?
*05:17.740- 05:20.140* :  Well, the ICRC's role is to act, in this case,
*05:20.140- 05:21.920* :  as an intermediary between the parties.
*05:21.980- 05:25.340* :  We are not involved in selecting who is released or when.
*05:26.080- 05:28.740* :  What our role was tonight was to make sure that these two people
*05:28.740- 05:31.580* :  were safely transported to a location
*05:31.580- 05:33.580* :  where they could be returned to their homes.
*05:34.340- 05:36.840* :  The process that we follow is done in a way
*05:36.840- 05:38.940* :  which is quite sensitive, as is the dialogue
*05:38.940- 05:40.180* :  that we have with the parties.
*05:40.900- 05:43.480* :  Our goal is to not seek publicity,
*05:43.820- 05:45.860* :  but to respond to questions that people have
*05:46.340- 05:50.500* :  about why the ICRC has such a quiet diplomatic role.
*05:50.860- 05:53.260* :  It's certainly also to make sure that we remain focused
*05:53.260- 05:56.360* :  on the safe return of people to their families,
*05:57.020- 05:59.720* :  because the ICRC's role is to focus on helping people
*05:59.720- 06:01.220* :  who are affected by an armed conflict
*06:01.720- 06:03.340* :  wherever they are and whoever they are.
*06:03.580- 06:07.300* :  And just give us an idea of how challenging your role is.
*06:07.500- 06:10.380* :  I'm talking about physically airstrikes,
*06:10.380- 06:14.740* :  the conditions there of trying to get people out safely.
*06:14.920- 06:16.580* :  Well, certainly this is something which involves
*06:16.580- 06:17.940* :  a large number of colleagues,
*06:17.940- 06:20.560* :  both here in Israel and the occupied territories
*06:21.080- 06:24.060* :  and around the world, or challenges are numerous.
*06:24.200- 06:26.060* :  And certainly, our teams, luckily,
*06:26.060- 06:27.840* :  we have a large number of staff
*06:27.840- 06:30.680* :  based in Gaza and before the escalation of this conflict,
*06:31.260- 06:33.780* :  over 100 staff, while they're responding
*06:33.780- 06:35.600* :  to the humanitarian needs on the grounds
*06:35.600- 06:37.160* :  of people affected by fighting.
*06:37.720- 06:40.220* :  They're also working wherever possible
*06:40.720- 06:42.980* :  to facilitate such relief operations.
*06:42.980- 06:45.720* :  And this is an extremely challenging environment to work in,
*06:46.240- 06:47.920* :  but the International Commission of the Red Cross
*06:48.040- 06:50.060* :  has a long experience working both
*06:50.060- 06:53.100* :  in difficult environments as well as facilitating
*06:53.100- 06:55.220* :  the dialogue between different parties
*06:55.520- 06:57.220* :  on the issues related to hostages.
*06:57.740- 07:00.500* :  Stephen Ryan from the ICRC in Jerusalem,
*07:00.780- 07:04.760* :  the Israeli government had said 222 people,
*07:04.760- 07:07.440* :  most of them civilians were currently being held hostage
*07:07.440- 07:08.200* :  in Gaza.
*07:08.940- 07:10.620* :  Meanwhile, the story is continued to emerge
*07:10.620- 07:13.700* :  of the circumstances in which many of the Israeli hostages
*07:13.700- 07:16.040* :  were taken on the 7th of October,
*07:16.520- 07:18.040* :  following the attacks by Hamas.
*07:18.400- 07:21.080* :  Those attacks left 1,400 Israelis dead.
*07:21.860- 07:24.620* :  Hamas is designated a terror organisation
*07:24.620- 07:27.460* :  by many Western governments, including the UK.
*07:28.240- 07:30.040* :  Our correspondent Anna Foster has spoken
*07:30.040- 07:31.480* :  to another Israeli family.
*07:31.480- 07:34.060* :  There were desperate for news about their missing relative.
*07:34.620- 07:36.980* :  A report does contain some distressing details
*07:37.640- 07:40.260* :  including audio of the assault on the family's home,
*07:40.260- 07:44.520* :  which they were forced to live stream by the Hamas attackers.
*07:45.980- 07:48.320* :  Gali Adan has two priorities now.
*07:48.880- 07:51.440* :  The first is to protect her surviving children
*07:51.880- 07:54.080* :  in this peaceful kibbutz that's welcomed them in
*07:54.080- 07:55.540* :  since their home was destroyed.
*07:56.280- 07:59.140* :  The second is to get her husband Saki back.
*08:03.420- 08:06.220* :  On October the 7th, the family woke to the sound
*08:06.220- 08:07.640* :  of rocket alert sirens.
*08:08.240- 08:10.240* :  Hamas gunmen stormed into their home
*08:10.240- 08:13.040* :  in the kibbutz of Nahal Oz and began firing.
*08:16.980- 08:19.120* :  Their elder storker Mayan was shot dead
*08:19.440- 08:21.920* :  as she tried to help her father keep the men out
*08:21.920- 08:23.380* :  of the family's safe room.
*08:24.020- 08:26.640* :  She turned 18 just four days earlier.
*08:27.380- 08:28.820* :  Saki is broken.
*08:29.580- 08:30.540* :  Saki is broken.
*08:31.380- 08:32.560* :  He saw his daughter die.
*08:32.560- 08:34.960* :  He saw her getting shot in her head
*08:35.760- 08:37.600* :  and died next to him.
*08:37.900- 08:41.700* :  He's daughter that has just celebrated turning 18.
*08:42.340- 08:45.160* :  The house is full of balloons and congratulations
*08:45.220- 08:47.680* :  and blood that Kakhabite.
*08:48.560- 08:50.300* :  In the car, outside in the car.
*08:50.640- 08:51.140* :  Over the car.
*08:52.920- 08:55.680* :  Saki was driven away to Gaza with his daughter's blood
*08:55.680- 08:57.180* :  still covering his hands.
*08:58.040- 08:59.140* :  More than two weeks later,
*08:59.560- 09:02.620* :  the Idan family don't know where or how he is.
*09:06.640- 09:07.980* :  Mayan is a little bit...
*09:09.940- 09:11.140* :  Well, that doesn't show you.
*09:12.280- 09:15.700* :  Yesterday, they buried Mayan without her father at the funeral.
*09:16.660- 09:18.220* :  And their message is a clear one.
*09:18.720- 09:22.540* :  As negotiations for the release of the more than 220 hostages
*09:22.540- 09:26.240* :  continue and the potential of a ground invasion of Gaza remains,
*09:26.260- 09:30.100* :  they want their husband and father return to them in Israel,
*09:30.100- 09:32.000* :  safe and alive.
*09:32.680- 09:34.420* :  A report by Anna Foster.
*09:35.100- 09:38.220* :  Hundreds more people have been killed in the Gaza Strip
*09:38.220- 09:41.600* :  during the latest stage of the intensified Israeli bombardment
*09:41.640- 09:43.140* :  of the besieged territory.
*09:43.700- 09:45.720* :  The Hamas-run health ministry there
*09:45.720- 09:50.640* :  said over 430 people had died in 24 hours.
*09:50.980- 09:52.880* :  It says more than 5,000 people have been killed
*09:52.880- 09:54.940* :  since Israel began its bombing operation.
*09:55.460- 09:59.120* :  Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari from the Israel Defence Forces
*09:59.580- 10:02.280* :  said Israel has carried out limited incursions
*10:02.280- 10:05.460* :  inside the Gaza Strip ahead of a possible ground offensive.
*10:07.960- 10:08.640* :  There is a sortie,
*10:09.500- 10:12.120* :  which is attacking dozens of points where we understand
*10:12.660- 10:13.820* :  the terrorists are assembling.
*10:14.280- 10:15.720* :  The terrorists are getting organized
*10:15.720- 10:18.360* :  in anticipation of the next stages of the war
*10:18.720- 10:20.700* :  and our role is to reduce these threats.
*10:21.340- 10:24.800* :  Therefore, we are exploiting all of the time available to us
*10:25.040- 10:27.960* :  to improve our readiness and our ability to carry out
*10:27.960- 10:30.920* :  the ground maneuver in the best possible way.
*10:31.620- 10:34.620* :  Israel had told Palestinians to go to southern Gaza
*10:34.620- 10:37.980* :  for their own safety ahead of the possible ground offensive.
*10:38.180- 10:40.960* :  A woman who moved to Khan Unis in the South told the BBC
*10:41.140- 10:44.600* :  she had lost 13 members of her immediate family.
*10:45.260- 10:48.720* :  The third humanitarian convoy in as many days has reached
*10:48.720- 10:51.700* :  the Gaza Strip from Egypt via the Rafa crossing.
*10:51.700- 10:55.220* :  The Palestinian Red Crescent said the 20 trucks were loaded
*10:55.220- 10:57.620* :  with food, water and medical supplies.
*10:58.340- 11:01.320* :  Earlier the head of the main UN Agency helping Palestinians
*11:01.320- 11:04.960* :  in Gaza and Rwa said hundreds of truckloads of aid
*11:04.960- 11:07.100* :  were needed every day rather than the few
*11:07.500- 11:09.180* :  which had been allowed in so far.
*11:09.300- 11:12.000* :  Suraya Ali from Save the Children told the BBC
*11:12.000- 11:14.180* :  her charity was waiting to enter Gaza.
*11:14.800- 11:18.580* :  Save the Children has two trucks full of vital supplies
*11:18.580- 11:20.180* :  ready to go into Gaza.
*11:20.900- 11:22.560* :  Supplies are going in steadily.
*11:22.560- 11:24.180* :  It's nowhere near enough.
*11:24.780- 11:27.600* :  Gaza is home to 2.3 million people
*11:28.040- 11:30.360* :  and before the recent escalations in violence
*11:30.440- 11:34.440* :  about 80% of the population was dependent on aid.
*11:35.560- 11:39.520* :  A correspondent Rushji Abu Alouf lives and works in Gaza
*11:39.760- 11:41.360* :  and has been reporting on the situation there
*11:41.360- 11:44.100* :  since the Hamas attacks in Israel on October 7th.
*11:44.560- 11:47.560* :  He filed this report on the worsening humanitarian situation
*11:47.560- 11:50.380* :  live for BBC television news on Monday night
*11:50.760- 11:54.100* :  from a hospital courtyard in Khan Unis in southern Gaza.
*11:54.600- 11:56.740* :  His missiles were heard flying above him.
*11:57.180- 12:00.220* :  We will have been saying the trucks coming in
*12:00.220- 12:02.980* :  from the Egyptian side, but they are not getting any aid.
*12:02.980- 12:07.280* :  I think there is still some sort of negotiation going on
*12:07.280- 12:09.560* :  with Israel and how in which he ground
*12:09.560- 12:13.580* :  and who's going to handle the little fuel
*12:13.580- 12:15.940* :  that came from an old tank near the border
*12:16.380- 12:21.360* :  and also about 40 or 45 trucks carrying medicine, food, water.
*12:26.800- 12:31.000* :  It's been intense airstrikes tonight as well.
*12:31.640- 12:35.140* :  This is the third or fourth one just close to the hospital.
*12:35.900- 12:39.880* :  So another night of heavy bombing in southern Gaza and Unis.
*12:39.880- 12:43.920* :  This is the area where Israel asked 1.2 million people
*12:43.920- 12:44.540* :  to come in.
*12:44.540- 12:47.800* :  They said it's safer for you to be a South.
*12:48.260- 12:50.880* :  But as you can see, every night there is airstrikes
*12:50.880- 12:51.760* :  here in this area.
*12:52.140- 12:57.060* :  But in Gaza City, I think tonight Hamas local authority
*12:57.060- 13:00.140* :  said that Israel is committing massacres.
*13:00.160- 13:02.000* :  As they said, they destroyed three houses
*13:02.000- 13:03.300* :  over the heads of their people.
*13:03.740- 13:07.140* :  More than 20 people killed and dozens other injured.
*13:07.520- 13:10.400* :  When we talk about a humanitarian situation,
*13:10.860- 13:12.880* :  things are getting worse and worse here.
*13:12.880- 13:15.660* :  As the people are watching the trucks coming in,
*13:15.660- 13:18.200* :  but there is no aid being distributed.
*13:18.780- 13:22.820* :  Very little aid goes to the shelters, the UN shelters.
*13:22.820- 13:26.500* :  They are talking about 130 shelters
*13:26.500- 13:28.820* :  for the more than half million people
*13:28.820- 13:32.660* :  who are staying who are displaced from their houses
*13:32.660- 13:34.580* :  in Gaza City and the North.
*13:34.920- 13:36.080* :  And they came south.
*13:36.560- 13:40.360* :  They are now staying in the UN schools, UN shelters.
*13:40.380- 13:43.140* :  And hospitals here in this hospital courtyard,
*13:43.560- 13:45.600* :  hundreds of families are taking this hospital
*13:45.600- 13:50.240* :  as refugees with a very little food and very little water.
*13:50.260- 13:53.500* :  They are almost survived as they told me.
*13:53.840- 13:56.240* :  We have seen kids picking from journalists,
*13:56.660- 13:59.440* :  picking from medical teams and picking industry
*13:59.440- 14:01.300* :  for a water or food.
*14:01.300- 14:04.280* :  This is a catastrophic situation as the UN
*14:04.280- 14:05.140* :  describes it.
*14:05.420- 14:07.200* :  And the local authority here is trying
*14:07.200- 14:11.760* :  to manage what available they have very little resources.
*14:12.280- 14:14.880* :  Hospital is overwhelmed by the number of injuries
*14:14.880- 14:17.460* :  and they are struggling to cope with the situation.
*14:18.400- 14:20.480* :  Rasji Abu Aluf in southern Gaza
*14:20.480- 14:23.020* :  and he did manage to enter his report safely.
*14:23.880- 14:26.940* :  Well, the UN says more than 19,000 people
*14:26.940- 14:29.180* :  have been displaced in southern Lebanon
*14:29.760- 14:32.580* :  amid a surge in tensions along the border with Israel.
*14:32.580- 14:35.160* :  The Iranian-backed militia group, Hezbollah,
*14:35.660- 14:38.960* :  has mounted repeated missile and rocket attacks on Israel,
*14:38.960- 14:41.540* :  which has fired back at the group's launch sites.
*14:42.060- 14:43.820* :  Hugo Bachego is in Lebanon.
*14:44.520- 14:47.340* :  This morning, we visited some villages along the border
*14:47.800- 14:49.280* :  and people have left.
*14:49.840- 14:51.760* :  One village was completely deserted
*14:52.280- 14:53.720* :  because people are concerned.
*14:54.620- 14:57.220* :  Many of them still remember the devastation
*14:58.180- 15:02.820* :  brought by the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.
*15:02.880- 15:06.540* :  And all eyes here in this country are on Hezbollah,
*15:06.540- 15:09.040* :  which is this powerful military, social,
*15:09.380- 15:12.620* :  political movement that is supported by Iran.
*15:13.180- 15:16.040* :  It is considered a terrorist organization by the UK,
*15:16.040- 15:18.160* :  by the US and other countries.
*15:18.740- 15:19.700* :  Hugo Bachego.
*15:20.340- 15:21.460* :  Now on to other news.
*15:22.000- 15:24.900* :  A new research suggests that cutting greenhouse gases
*15:24.900- 15:26.940* :  may no longer be enough to stop the West
*15:26.940- 15:29.640* :  and tactic ice sheet collapsing into the sea.
*15:30.080- 15:32.280* :  An article in the journal Nature Climate Change
*15:32.700- 15:35.480* :  says the process is likely to take hundreds of years
*15:35.540- 15:38.380* :  but could raise sea levels by up to five meters.
*15:38.880- 15:41.240* :  The researchers say this is enough to flood
*15:41.240- 15:43.360* :  many coastal cities around the world.
*15:43.720- 15:46.160* :  Our climate editor Justin Roland told me more
*15:46.320- 15:47.100* :  about the findings.
*15:47.520- 15:50.720* :  The West Antarctic ice sheet is particularly vulnerable.
*15:50.720- 15:52.380* :  I mean, some people say it's the most vulnerable,
*15:52.980- 15:54.560* :  large bit of ice in the world.
*15:54.560- 15:57.960* :  And that's because it rests on bedrock below sea level.
*15:58.360- 16:00.940* :  And that means that the water washes right up
*16:00.940- 16:01.800* :  to the front of the ice.
*16:01.800- 16:03.700* :  And in theory, the water warns up.
*16:03.700- 16:07.180* :  It can eat into the ice and undermine it, melt it from beneath.
*16:07.180- 16:11.020* :  And so it really is vulnerable to even the smallest changes
*16:11.600- 16:12.340* :  in water temperature.
*16:12.340- 16:16.560* :  And what this new paper says is that even under
*16:16.560- 16:20.340* :  the strongest climate action, the deepest carbon cuts,
*16:20.880- 16:23.240* :  the water around the West Antarctic
*16:23.340- 16:25.720* :  is likely to warm three times as fast as it did
*16:26.280- 16:27.120* :  in the last century.
*16:27.260- 16:30.980* :  And that means it will begin to melt away the ice shelves.
*16:30.980- 16:32.180* :  Those are the kind of buttresses
*16:32.740- 16:34.340* :  that kind of hold the ice sheet in place.
*16:34.720- 16:37.860* :  If those melt away, the ice behind the ice sheet
*16:38.380- 16:40.220* :  moves flows down into the water
*16:40.220- 16:42.500* :  and then it's exposed to the water and can melt away.
*16:42.940- 16:45.160* :  And of course, as well as losing the ice sheets
*16:45.160- 16:48.980* :  that has enormous consequences in terms of sea level rise.
*16:48.980- 16:52.260* :  Here's Caitlin Norton of the British Antarctic Survey.
*16:52.560- 16:54.340* :  She's one of the authors of this new paper.
*16:54.820- 16:57.960* :  We found that no matter what we do with fossil fuel emissions,
*16:58.160- 17:01.580* :  we can expect ocean warming and ice shelf melting
*17:01.580- 17:04.300* :  in this region to speed up by about a factor of three
*17:04.720- 17:06.200* :  over the next century.
*17:06.200- 17:08.620* :  So it seems like we are already committed
*17:09.160- 17:11.460* :  to some pretty rapid changes in the future.
*17:12.400- 17:15.140* :  Why is it important to protect ice in the Antarctic?
*17:15.680- 17:16.860* :  Well, it's important to protect ice
*17:16.860- 17:19.280* :  as you heard there to stop the sea level rising.
*17:19.340- 17:22.360* :  Potentially, in the West Antarctic alone,
*17:22.360- 17:24.940* :  up to five meters of sea level rise,
*17:25.860- 17:28.120* :  even a small rise in sea level would affect millions of people
*17:28.120- 17:31.100* :  because so many of our cities are located on the coast
*17:31.100- 17:34.540* :  or on rivers which are essentially a pretty near sea level.
*17:34.540- 17:36.720* :  So lots of cities could be flooded.
*17:37.880- 17:40.160* :  So does sound rather pessimistic, isn't it?
*17:41.000- 17:42.060* :  Well, I think it is pessimistic.
*17:42.060- 17:45.100* :  I mean, what they're saying is that even if we accelerate
*17:45.100- 17:47.580* :  our carbon cuts, it's not going to have a huge effect
*17:48.100- 17:50.920* :  on the melting of this vast body of ice.
*17:51.320- 17:52.860* :  But if you talk to the scientists, they say,
*17:52.860- 17:55.100* :  listen, this is not an excuse to give up.
*17:55.100- 17:56.720* :  They say, look at the other side.
*17:56.720- 17:58.500* :  Look to the east to East Antarctica,
*17:58.500- 18:00.280* :  which has far more ice on it,
*18:00.600- 18:03.800* :  10 times as much 50 meters of sea level rise
*18:04.260- 18:05.380* :  in the East Antarctic.
*18:05.380- 18:06.780* :  Now, because that sits on the land,
*18:06.860- 18:08.920* :  the big determinate about how quickly it melts
*18:08.920- 18:11.480* :  is air temperatures and across Antarctica,
*18:11.480- 18:13.820* :  we're expecting air temperatures to remain below zero
*18:13.820- 18:16.320* :  for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
*18:16.320- 18:18.920* :  So as long as we can moderate climate change
*18:18.920- 18:22.340* :  and keep the air temperature across Antarctica below zero,
*18:22.760- 18:25.980* :  that would be a huge gift, if you like, to our descendant.
*18:25.980- 18:27.560* :  So we're going to have to live with the consequences,
*18:27.560- 18:30.700* :  the decisions that we make about this kind of thing
*18:30.700- 18:31.460* :  in the future.
*18:32.100- 18:32.820* :  Just in roll out.
*18:35.580- 18:36.100* :  Still to come.
*18:36.520- 18:38.100* :  There's so much inequality of wealth.
*18:38.760- 18:44.040* :  Wealth inequality is about twice that of income inequality.
*18:44.460- 18:48.180* :  Could billionaires have to pay a minimum rate of tax?
*18:55.340- 18:58.640* :  Have you ever wondered what sets exceptional leaders apart?
*18:59.640- 19:02.220* :  Discover how renowned leaders from around the globe

*19:24.000- 19:27.780* :  The explanation is the podcast from the BBC World Service
*19:27.780- 19:32.460* :  that goes beyond the spin, exploring the important questions
*19:32.460- 19:36.620* :  about long-running stories and the latest global news.

*19:44.620- 19:46.220* :  your BBC podcast.
*19:48.180- 19:50.440* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast.
*19:51.320- 19:55.820* :  Nigeria has won an $11 billion case in a British court
*19:55.820- 19:57.280* :  over a failed gas deal.
*19:57.740- 20:00.500* :  The judge found that a company based in the British Virgin,
*20:00.500- 20:06.860* :  Ireland's P and ID had paid bribes to an Nigerian oil ministry official.
*20:06.860- 20:08.740* :  Mione Jones has more details.
*20:09.600- 20:14.840* :  In 2017, Africa's largest economy was ordered to pay $11 billion to P and ID
*20:15.360- 20:17.540* :  around a third of its foreign exchange reserves.
*20:18.200- 20:22.840* :  But Nigeria's lawyers appealed arguing that P and ID had paid bribes
*20:22.840- 20:25.720* :  to obtain the contract and corrupted the country's lawyers
*20:25.720- 20:28.600* :  to obtain confidential documents during the arbitration.
*20:29.340- 20:31.780* :  P and ID denied Nigeria's allegations,
*20:31.860- 20:35.620* :  blaming the failure of the gas deal on institutional incompetence.
*20:36.520- 20:37.200* :  Mione Jones.
*20:37.780- 20:42.400* :  Still with Nigeria, eight months after President Bo Le Tinibou was officially elected,
*20:42.400- 20:46.080* :  his political opponents have gone to the Supreme Court, claiming the vote
*20:46.080- 20:46.880* :  was rigged.
*20:47.200- 20:49.320* :  Their legal challenge was rejected last month.
*20:49.320- 20:52.240* :  But now as part of their appeal, they've presented new claims
*20:52.240- 20:56.540* :  that Mr Tinibou forged his diploma from an American university.
*20:56.540- 21:00.720* :  The president did eyes any wrongdoing, our reporter, Chris Awakor,
*21:00.740- 21:04.780* :  is in the Nigerian capital of Boudre and told me more about the allegations.
*21:05.460- 21:09.180* :  His opponents, Atikwa Babaka, who was from a president of Nigeria,
*21:09.180- 21:13.180* :  and Pita Ubi, said that there was intimidation,
*21:13.180- 21:18.800* :  there was overvoting, there was vote buying and rigging,
*21:18.800- 21:21.960* :  which were rejected by the Petition Tribunal.
*21:22.480- 21:27.360* :  Despite that, Atikwa Babaka has now presented a new evidence.
*21:28.020- 21:31.560* :  He says that President Tinibou submitted or
*21:31.680- 21:33.600* :  certificate to the electoral authorities,
*21:34.200- 21:37.580* :  which is invariance with what was
*21:37.580- 21:42.280* :  properly issued to him by the Chicago State University,
*21:42.280- 21:46.160* :  where he claimed he attended and that the Supreme Court
*21:46.560- 21:48.400* :  should now look at the new evidence
*21:48.420- 21:52.460* :  as well as the other body of evidence that had been presented
*21:52.460- 21:57.860* :  and declare that President Tinibou was not qualified to run for president.
*21:58.480- 22:02.160* :  So these men think they've got strong grounds to challenge this.
*22:02.160- 22:05.380* :  Any realistic chance they will succeed?
*22:06.220- 22:11.960* :  Well, that is a very big question in Nigeria since 1999,
*22:12.260- 22:17.640* :  when the country returned to civil rule or moved away from military rule.
*22:17.700- 22:24.060* :  We have often seen that oppositions or those who didn't win the election
*22:24.060- 22:27.580* :  have often gone to court to challenge the outcome of the election.
*22:27.720- 22:30.900* :  But in all the challenges, I had the Appalachian Court,
*22:30.900- 22:33.820* :  which serve as the Petition Tribunal or the Supreme Court,
*22:33.820- 22:37.480* :  have always upheld the winner of the election.
*22:38.180- 22:43.180* :  How is President Tinibou and his party reacting to this challenge?
*22:43.960- 22:49.060* :  Well, expertly, President Tinibou and his party actually
*22:49.800- 22:53.840* :  in court today at the Supreme Court, when they're here in started,
*22:54.600- 22:59.180* :  President Tinibou's legal team said that the Supreme Court should
*22:59.180- 23:03.960* :  discount announce the challenges and strike out the appeal
*23:04.360- 23:06.180* :  because they lack merit.
*23:06.580- 23:10.400* :  But what I can also say is that these challenges
*23:11.040- 23:13.600* :  have polarized opinions in Nigeria,
*23:14.220- 23:15.520* :  especially on social media.
*23:16.000- 23:20.680* :  You see clashes between the supporters of each of these politicians.
*23:21.380- 23:28.300* :  And everybody now appear to be looking to what the decision of the Supreme Court
*23:28.720- 23:29.180* :  would be.
*23:29.840- 23:33.820* :  We're expecting that the decision will be reached in a matter of weeks' time.
*23:34.380- 23:36.260* :  Christopher Walker in Abuja.
*23:36.580- 23:40.300* :  Next to Pakistan, where the Supreme Court has ruled that military trials
*23:40.300- 23:42.880* :  of civilians are unconstitutional.
*23:42.880- 23:47.500* :  The judges said all such trials are those held in connection with the violence
*23:48.020- 23:51.040* :  in the aftermath of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's arrest,
*23:51.040- 23:54.360* :  in a corruption case in May, should be null and void.
*23:54.860- 23:56.140* :  And Brassan Etirajan reports.
*23:56.780- 24:01.000* :  More than a hundred people were facing charges of attacks on military compounds
*24:01.000- 24:04.700* :  during the unrest that followed the detention of Imran Khan.
*24:04.700- 24:09.420* :  The violence saw unprecedented attacks on Pakistani military compounds.
*24:10.000- 24:12.680* :  The authorities called it a rebellion against the state
*24:12.680- 24:15.920* :  and said they would use military codes to try the suspects.
*24:16.580- 24:18.260* :  Rights groups criticized the move,
*24:18.440- 24:22.500* :  saying such trials violated an individual's right to due process.
*24:22.980- 24:26.620* :  On Monday, the Supreme Court ordered the transfer of all the cases
*24:26.620- 24:28.940* :  from military codes to civilian ones.
*24:28.940- 24:34.000* :  A senior lawyer said Monday's judgment would strengthen Pakistan's constitution
*24:34.000- 24:35.180* :  and democracy.
*24:35.720- 24:37.260* :  Ambrassan Etirajan.
*24:38.040- 24:41.000* :  Women in Iceland are going on strike on Tuesday.
*24:41.500- 24:44.980* :  It's not the first time, but it is the first time since 1975.
*24:45.520- 24:46.960* :  Paid work, unpaid work.
*24:47.540- 24:50.660* :  Women won't be doing it as a protest at the gender pay gap.
*24:51.320- 24:55.980* :  Including the Prime Minister, Evan Davis, spoke to Lillia Dog Alfred Stottia,
*24:56.340- 24:59.600* :  the Minister for Tourism, Trade and Culture in the Icelandic government
*25:00.100- 25:01.600* :  is also taking part in the strike.
*25:02.260- 25:06.280* :  We celebrate this day because this is a day that women's rights
*25:06.280- 25:07.780* :  are celebrated worldwide.
*25:08.660- 25:13.920* :  And in 1975 was the first strike or it was called then the day off
*25:14.120- 25:17.660* :  where about 90%, 90% of all women,
*25:18.340- 25:20.860* :  they decided to stop working
*25:21.540- 25:25.780* :  in order to emphasize the importance that they have in the labour force.
*25:26.080- 25:27.120* :  And it's unpaid work as well.
*25:27.120- 25:31.980* :  So if women in Iceland are doing more of the cleaning at home,
*25:32.680- 25:34.940* :  it's going to be a little bit grubbier.
*25:35.060- 25:37.720* :  I wonder whether the men will just leave it for Wednesday
*25:37.720- 25:41.860* :  and then say, can you clean up for the day you weren't working on Tuesday, maybe?
*25:41.980- 25:46.700* :  Well, I think that one of the things and one of the aims of these actions
*25:46.700- 25:52.700* :  is also the awareness of the different positions that men, women,
*25:52.700- 25:54.300* :  often have as to household.
*25:55.000- 26:00.200* :  So just also just a discussion and will improve, I think,
*26:00.340- 26:02.180* :  matters in many places.
*26:02.300- 26:02.500* :  Indeed.
*26:02.980- 26:04.820* :  You draw your attention to it, isn't it?
*26:06.400- 26:06.420* :  Yes.
*26:06.420- 26:07.020* :  There's a conversation that people have.
*26:07.980- 26:12.060* :  And for instance, my, I have a daughter who is 14 years old.
*26:12.060- 26:17.600* :  I mean, she will not attend any classes where women are teaching her.
*26:18.360- 26:21.100* :  And they all think that more about it.
*26:22.960- 26:23.040* :  It's the same thing.
*26:23.040- 26:23.860* :  I have a son who's 16-year-old.
*26:23.980- 26:28.860* :  And I mean, you wouldn't have this discussion unless these actions were taken.
*26:29.300- 26:34.040* :  And I can also tell you that the wage gap in Iceland
*26:34.040- 26:37.160* :  is probably one of the smallest.
*26:37.720- 26:41.320* :  Billiard Dog, Alfred's daughter here there who's the Minister for Tourism,
*26:41.320- 26:44.380* :  Trade and Culture in the Icelandic government.
*26:45.320- 26:50.280* :  What's staying with matters financial are billionaires paying two little tax
*26:50.280- 26:53.720* :  and just how do we solve that problem?
*26:54.280- 26:57.260* :  What a new report from the European Union tax observatory says
*26:57.260- 26:59.340* :  they should face a minimum tax rate.
*27:00.000- 27:02.480* :  Joseph Stiglitz wrote the introduction to the report.
*27:02.480- 27:06.340* :  He's a former chief economist at the World Bank and a Nobel Prize winner
*27:06.840- 27:08.260* :  for his work on economics.
*27:08.540- 27:11.640* :  Rahul Tandon asked him what the main proposal was in this report.
*27:12.280- 27:17.300* :  The proposal that's been put forward is a global wealth tax.
*27:17.300- 27:18.580* :  Attacks under wealth.
*27:19.020- 27:24.740* :  And attacks at a very low rate would actually generate huge amounts of money.
*27:25.220- 27:31.140* :  And the reason that it generates so much money is that there's so much inequality of wealth.
*27:31.880- 27:37.100* :  Wealth inequality is about twice that of income inequality.
*27:37.960- 27:39.060* :  What we're talking about isn't it?
*27:39.060- 27:43.540* :  It's a 2% wealth levy that could help raise $250 billion a year.
*27:43.920- 27:45.100* :  That sounds great in principle.
*27:45.100- 27:47.180* :  And we've sort of had something similar, haven't we?
*27:47.400- 27:51.720* :  There's been put on multinationals in terms of a 15% minimum tax rate.
*27:52.180- 27:55.700* :  But how possible is it really to implement this?
*27:55.700- 27:58.260* :  It's a great idea, but it's not really practical, is it?
*27:58.580- 27:59.480* :  It could be done.
*27:59.920- 28:01.540* :  There's a lot of discussion.
*28:01.540- 28:07.900* :  Since the 2008 financial crisis of doing something about the tax havens
*28:08.360- 28:10.540* :  where so much money is hidden.
*28:11.360- 28:15.680* :  And we put a lot of pressure on these tax havens.
*28:15.900- 28:17.240* :  There is more transparency.
*28:18.360- 28:29.300* :  My own view is that these tax havens exist because the wealthy countries wanted to exist.
*28:30.280- 28:38.720* :  And if US and the EU together said we're not going to allow these safe havens,
*28:38.720- 28:43.440* :  these secrecy havens to continue doing what they're doing,
*28:43.440- 28:47.700* :  I think it would be easy for us to implement a tax like that.
*28:48.180- 28:50.360* :  OK, but let's look at President Biden.
*28:50.420- 28:52.980* :  He wanted to propose something similar, didn't he?
*28:53.280- 28:58.680* :  A levy basically on unrealized capital gains of those who are earning huge amounts of money.
*28:58.880- 29:00.640* :  And he wasn't able to get it through.
*29:00.640- 29:04.500* :  That shows you the scale of the problem in trying to put this in place.
*29:04.840- 29:09.360* :  It's obvious that those who are avoiding paying their fair share of taxes
*29:09.360- 29:16.740* :  will do everything they can and use every bogus argument to make sure it doesn't happen.
*29:17.500- 29:19.780* :  But there are small percentage of the population.
*29:20.620- 29:28.780* :  And we desperately need these tax revenues for a whole variety of things.
*29:29.540- 29:31.740* :  And not the least of which is the fight climate change.
*29:32.500- 29:35.700* :  So I'm hopeful that democracy will prevail.
*29:36.360- 29:38.840* :  I don't think it's going to be easy. It's going to be a fight.
*29:39.200- 29:48.880* :  And that's why the report of the observatory detailing the magnitude of this tax avoidance is so important.
*29:49.420- 29:52.380* :  Joseph Stiglitz, a former chief economist at the World Bank,
*29:52.940- 29:55.940* :  and a Nobel Prize winner for his work on economics.
*29:56.800- 30:00.900* :  One of India's all-time greatest cricketers, Bishan Singh Betty,
*30:00.900- 30:03.100* :  has died at the age of 77.
*30:03.100- 30:12.240* :  The left arm's been a captain to his country and took 266 test wickets between 1966 and 1979.
*30:13.800- 30:14.520* :  It must be close.
*30:15.220- 30:19.500* :  It reads just four short of his 100 and a lovely piece of bowling there from Betty.
*30:19.500- 30:21.060* :  That really was good bowling.
*30:22.500- 30:23.120* :  Well, that's out.
*30:23.580- 30:26.000* :  We'll get the baby a little bit of bouncer, surprisingly.
*30:26.940- 30:32.520* :  Well, baby, Fletcher goes a very simple catcher on the corner to Salka and he's unlikely to miss anything like that.
*30:33.520- 30:39.920* :  A skipper, Betty, once declared India's second innings at 97 for five against the West Indies in Jamaica.
*30:40.560- 30:44.260* :  In protest what he considered intimidatory bowling.
*30:44.380- 30:49.200* :  He also forfeited a game against Pakistan, alleging the umpires were biased.
*30:49.740- 30:54.240* :  After retiring, Bishan Betty continued to be known for his outspoken views on the game,
*30:54.240- 30:56.000* :  criticizing players and officials.
*30:56.160- 31:00.100* :  The great Indian batsman, Sachin Tundulka, paid tribute to his former coach,
*31:00.520- 31:03.820* :  saying the world seems an emptier place without you.
*31:04.480- 31:08.220* :  The world's oldest dog has died at the age of 31.
*31:08.220- 31:12.700* :  Bobby, a Guinness World record holder, passed away at his home in Portugal at the weekend.
*31:12.980- 31:20.360* :  He was a crossbreed mountain sheep dog, and his lifestyle and diets will be studied by dog lovers everywhere,
*31:20.600- 31:23.340* :  keen to give their pets the longest life possible.
*31:23.880- 31:26.420* :  Paul Henley heard more from Karen Becker.
*31:26.420- 31:32.080* :  An American vet and author who went to visit Bobby as part of the research for her latest book.
*31:32.700- 31:40.660* :  Bobby is an easygoing, very laid back, very happy dog that has had this abundant life living outside,
*31:40.660- 31:44.620* :  eating fresh food in a very low stress, happy environment.
*31:44.980- 31:47.880* :  In the village he was born, in fact, in the house that he was born at.
*31:48.200- 31:49.800* :  He was a big dog, wasn't he?
*31:49.860- 31:52.660* :  And we're always told it's the smaller breeds that live the longest.
*31:53.500- 31:58.620* :  You know, he is a Raphael, the Portuguese term for mixed breed or a mutt.
*31:58.620- 32:03.220* :  And Bobby was not a pure bred dog, despite a lot of people reporting him as such.
*32:03.760- 32:08.040* :  Leonel's father was a hunter and collected many mixed breed dogs over the years.
*32:08.280- 32:13.040* :  And Bobby was a mixed breed dog that was actually born in a shed behind their home.
*32:13.700- 32:17.100* :  And he was a larger dog for being as old as he was.
*32:17.380- 32:22.160* :  He was a 55 pound dog and he was actually a little overweight in the second part of his life,
*32:22.160- 32:26.820* :  which is also an interesting fact that typically doesn't correlate with extra longevity.
*32:26.980- 32:31.020* :  But in Bobby's situation, I really think it was his lifestyle,
*32:31.020- 32:36.220* :  as well as probably a good set of excellent DNA that contributed to his exceptionally long with life.
*32:36.600- 32:40.960* :  And we hear that he ate Mediterranean food from the garden.
*32:41.040- 32:43.060* :  There must have been some meat involved though, was there?
*32:43.420- 32:44.500* :  Yes, there certainly was.
*32:44.620- 32:47.840* :  So Leonel and his family grow much of the food that they eat.
*32:47.840- 32:49.100* :  They have a massive garden.
*32:49.620- 32:50.880* :  Bobby is free to roam.
*32:50.880- 32:52.900* :  He'd never been on a leash in his whole life.
*32:52.900- 32:53.820* :  He's free to roam.
*32:54.160- 32:55.780* :  And he nibbled from the garden every day.
*32:56.340- 32:59.920* :  But he also never consumed any ultra processed dog food.
*33:00.300- 33:02.960* :  So he never had dry food or kibble or canned food.
*33:02.960- 33:09.940* :  His family prepared his meal every day, fresh from the garden, as well as raising rabbits and chickens.
*33:09.980- 33:15.680* :  And also fish every day, Bobby would eat a piece of fish that his family prepared for him.
*33:15.720- 33:19.640* :  So he did eat a lot of meat and then freshly prepared vegetables as well.
*33:20.060- 33:25.740* :  And just like an ingredient in human longevity, love seems to have been involved, being popular.
*33:26.540- 33:27.360* :  It's so true.
*33:27.460- 33:34.740* :  In fact, when I asked Leonel what he thought were the most powerful contributors to Bobby's exceptionally long life.
*33:34.980- 33:39.240* :  He said, good food, contact with nature, freedom to move around his environment.
*33:39.240- 33:41.200* :  Really good vet care and love.
*33:41.200- 33:44.780* :  He said, I believe that Bobby knows that he's deeply loved.
*33:45.380- 33:52.820* :  And I would say after seeing Bobby's interaction with his entire family, Bobby absolutely knew that he was very well loved.
*33:53.460- 33:54.460* :  Did Bobby have puppies?
*33:54.460- 33:55.740* :  They must be much in demand.
*33:56.820- 33:58.140* :  You know, Bobby was intact.
*33:58.140- 33:59.300* :  He was not neutered.
*33:59.320- 34:03.220* :  But to Leonel's knowledge, he has not sired any letters.
*34:03.780- 34:06.340* :  But right now we are testing his DNA.
*34:06.340- 34:15.060* :  When I was there, I did some DNA samples for an eco coobinially, which is the head researcher for the family dog project out of Hungary.
*34:15.060- 34:23.700* :  And she was actually the researcher that identified the DNA of exceptionally long live dogs that she called methusilla dogs.
*34:24.240- 34:34.580* :  We have taken swabs and right now those samples are being processed to determine if indeed Bobby carried the DNA that powerfully contributed to his extra long life.
*34:34.580- 34:41.400* :  We don't know the answer yet, but we're all pretty suspicious and confident that he probably has got some pretty good genetic material going on.
*34:41.840- 34:50.480* :  Vett and author Karen Becker on the life of Bobby, the world's oldest dog who's died at the age of 31, almost 31 and a half in fact.
