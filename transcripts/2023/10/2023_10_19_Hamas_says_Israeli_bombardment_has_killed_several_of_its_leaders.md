*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.320* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.860- 00:24.980* :  I'm Gareth Barlow and at 13 GMT on Thursday the 19th of October. These are our main stories.
*00:25.600- 00:29.300* :  The British Prime Minister arrives in Israel amid another flurry of diplomacy
*00:29.840- 00:33.920* :  as preparations continue for the reopening of the crossing between Egypt and Gaza
*00:34.360- 00:39.520* :  through which aid will be transferred. Meanwhile in Venezuela calls for the US to continue easing
*00:39.520- 00:48.280* :  sanctions in return for democratic reform. Also in this podcast, the 20th, 23th Sahara of
*00:48.280- 00:53.620* :  Price for Freedom of Thought has been awarded to Gina Makhsa Amini.
*00:53.940- 00:57.580* :  The EU's Human Rights Prize has been awarded to the late Masa Amini
*00:57.700- 01:02.880* :  and the Iranian women's protest movement. And we hear about the man who created the world's
*01:02.880- 01:11.640* :  most high-tech, dangerous and popular 3D-printed gun. But first, after President Biden of the
*01:11.640- 01:17.200* :  United States, the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak becomes the latest world leader to visit Israel
*01:17.200- 01:22.080* :  after the deadly Hamas attacks of October the 7th, he's been meeting his Israeli counterpart
*01:22.080- 01:27.340* :  Benjamin Netanyahu. In a joint news conference, Mr. Sunak confirmed Britain's support for the
*01:27.340- 01:31.900* :  Israelis. Mr. Netanyahu meanwhile stressed the importance of the military operation
*01:32.240- 01:36.200* :  and thumped the lectern as he invoked the spirit of Britain's struggles during the Second
*01:36.200- 01:42.400* :  World War. 80 years ago Prime Minister, the civilized world stood with you in your darkest hour.
*01:43.140- 01:49.300* :  This is our darkest hour. It's the world's darkest hour. We need to stand together
*01:50.460- 01:56.880* :  and we win a win. That means that this is a long war and we'll need your continuous support.
*01:56.880- 02:01.900* :  There'll be ups and downs, there'll be difficulties, but we need that unity across the board
*02:01.900- 02:09.920* :  and continuous support as we prosecute and win this just war against the modern barbarians,
*02:10.220- 02:14.680* :  the worst monsters on the planet. Thank you Rishi for coming here.
*02:17.000- 02:20.740* :  Well Prime Minister, thank you for your warm words and for welcoming me to Israel.
*02:20.740- 02:27.180* :  And I want to share the deep condolences of the British people and stress that we absolutely
*02:27.180- 02:33.100* :  support Israel's right to defend itself in line with international law, to go after Hamas,
*02:33.100- 02:40.080* :  to take back hostages, deter further incursions and to strengthen your security for the long term.
*02:40.840- 02:46.800* :  Now, I know that you are taking every precaution to avoid harming civilians in direct contrast
*02:46.860- 02:54.520* :  to the terrorists of Hamas, which seek to put civilians in harm's way. And we also recognise that
*02:54.980- 03:02.020* :  the Palestinian people are victims of Hamas too. And that is why I welcome your decision yesterday
*03:02.020- 03:08.480* :  that you took to ensure that routes into Gaza will be opened for humanitarian aid to enter.
*03:08.940- 03:13.840* :  I'm glad that you made that decision. The last thing for me to close on is this.
*03:14.700- 03:20.020* :  You describe this as Israel's darker staff. Well, then it's for me to say I'm proud to stand here
*03:20.560- 03:25.080* :  with you in Israel's darker staff. As your friend, we will stand with you in solidarity,
*03:25.080- 03:28.620* :  we will stand with your people, and we also want you to win.
*03:29.000- 03:33.460* :  The voice there of the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunaka before him Benjamin Netanyahi.
*03:33.920- 03:37.080* :  Our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asher, was listening to the two leaders.
*03:37.500- 03:39.980* :  I put to him that the comments were particularly strong.
*03:40.820- 03:46.280* :  From a Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahi, yes, and we've had strong words with him pretty much
*03:46.280- 03:53.620* :  every day. I mean, he has, you didn't play the clip there, but he before that described Hamas as
*03:53.620- 04:00.320* :  not just the new ISIS but the new Nazis. So his rhetoric, again as we heard, there is essentially
*04:00.320- 04:06.100* :  saying that Hamas is the most extreme, the most monstrous force in the world at the moment.
*04:06.800- 04:09.500* :  From the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunaka, I mean, we heard it all there.
*04:09.620- 04:15.300* :  I mean, this was to show solidarity both from the people, the UK, but also personal.
*04:15.300- 04:19.540* :  Very similar to what President Biden did yesterday, but perhaps differently for President Biden,
*04:19.540- 04:25.260* :  I mean, obviously, U.S. is a very, very powerful, most significant ally of Israel.
*04:26.040- 04:30.900* :  And he had to have something happen after that, which was the decision to open the
*04:30.900- 04:35.020* :  wrath of crossing. I don't think that anything is expected like that from Rishi Sunaka's visit
*04:35.020- 04:40.320* :  in actual moving things forward, but you also heard that message from him that he absolutely
*04:40.460- 04:44.860* :  believes in the right of Israel to defend itself, to take action against Hamas, but it should
*04:44.860- 04:50.420* :  remain within international law. With regards to the situation in Gaza, we've seen some reports
*04:50.420- 04:57.300* :  that Israel has killed some senior Hamas commanders. What do we know? And also, should we take this
*04:57.300- 05:01.460* :  as anchor, why would Hamas be saying that these commanders have been killed? This is, as you say,
*05:01.460- 05:07.260* :  immediate inside Gaza, so essentially controlled by Hamas. And we're saying that the head of the
*05:07.260- 05:13.380* :  national security forces inside Gaza, Jihad, Mahaisin, was killed along with his family, which
*05:13.380- 05:17.780* :  has happened quite regularly. I mean, Israel's been providing a list of this. And because they're
*05:17.780- 05:23.560* :  attacking them in their homes, I mean, there is members of a family have been killed pretty much
*05:23.560- 05:29.620* :  every time. Also saying that the widow of one of the founders of Hamas, Abdulaziz, Al-Rantisi,
*05:29.620- 05:33.280* :  and also quite a figure on our own right, she was the first woman to go on the Hamas and
*05:33.280- 05:37.980* :  Politburo has been killed overnight. In answer to your question about why Hamas would do it?
*05:38.260- 05:44.680* :  Well, they celebrate death. They martyred him, so they are actually quite proud of it. I think
*05:44.740- 05:49.380* :  where we need to be more careful as perhaps their figures more widely of the deaths in Gaza,
*05:49.380- 05:54.080* :  I think that was brought to the fore by the hospital blast, where we're still not really sure how
*05:54.080- 05:59.420* :  many people killed the original assessment of 500. It may turn out to be considered
*05:59.420- 06:03.300* :  be less. So I think that's where some skepticism is probably more necessary.
*06:03.700- 06:07.800* :  I'm Italy's analyst, Sebastian Asher. Well, hundreds of aid workers are gathering on the
*06:07.800- 06:12.280* :  Egyptian side of the Rafacrossing, hoping to get aid for guards of flowing. The
*06:12.280- 06:16.640* :  Israel's pledge not to prevent the aid deliveries unless supplies reach Hamas.
*06:17.040- 06:21.460* :  Motion sign is from the Egyptian food bank. One of the charities on the Egyptian side of the
*06:21.460- 06:26.080* :  Rafacrossing waiting to provide aid. A minute Jones asked him how prepared they are to begin
*06:26.080- 06:33.040* :  moving supplies. Everything is ready to go. We have around 120 trucks that is completely paid
*06:33.040- 06:41.500* :  for by the Egyptian people. So I run the Egyptian food bank and I got with me from Cairo 41
*06:41.500- 06:48.520* :  trucks and I'm ready with 50 more in Cairo. Once I get those through, I will push the extra 50.
*06:49.720- 06:54.380* :  Everything is paid for by the Egyptian people from their donations. And then you have in a
*06:54.380- 07:00.640* :  Irish airport, you have at least seven or eight cargo planes worth of supplies from international
*07:00.640- 07:07.620* :  development organizations like the WHO and from countries like Jordan, UAE, Qatar and Russia,
*07:07.620- 07:13.180* :  I think, sent the plane also today. You have all this stationed at the border and everything
*07:13.180- 07:17.100* :  is ready to be dispatched in a moment. How long do you think you might have to wait?
*07:17.800- 07:22.500* :  We hope to get things through either tonight or tomorrow. But actually, this is not the first time
*07:22.500- 07:28.160* :  we'll hear something like that. A few or four days ago, Secretary Blinken also said the
*07:28.160- 07:32.840* :  supplies will go through. And then next day, the Prime Minister Netanyahu's office said,
*07:32.840- 07:37.420* :  no, no, we denied that. We don't know anything about that. And we will not stop bombing. And
*07:37.420- 07:42.780* :  they continued bombing. I hope there is any side sticks to the announcement by President Biden
*07:42.780- 07:47.620* :  and they stopped bombing. So we can get through. I repeat, the only problem that's preventing
*07:47.620- 07:54.660* :  aid from getting through is that Israel is bombing everywhere in Gaza, including just near the crossing
*07:54.660- 08:00.740* :  from Gaza side every day countless bombs. And without it, there is no one there. And I have to
*08:00.740- 08:05.720* :  repeat to everyone listening. There is no one there in that area. There is zero people. What are they
*08:05.720- 08:09.900* :  bombing? That was Merchand Sahib there. Well, let's take a look at some of the day's other events.
*08:09.900- 08:15.000* :  The European Union's highest human rights award, the Sikar of Prize, has been given to the
*08:15.000- 08:20.800* :  Women Life Freedom Movement in Iran and posthumously to Masat Amini. The announcement was made by
*08:20.800- 08:26.600* :  the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Mazzella. I am very proud to announce
*08:27.960- 08:35.900* :  that the 2023 Sahar of Prize for Freedom of Thought has been awarded to Gina Makhsamini
*08:36.400- 08:42.640* :  and the Women Life and Freedom Movement in Iran. The Sahar Amini died in custody just over a
*08:42.640- 08:48.080* :  year ago after being detained by Iran's morality police. It sparked a wave of protests across
*08:48.080- 08:52.740* :  the country and protests around the world. Roberta Mazzella said it marked a turning point that
*08:52.740- 08:58.220* :  triggered a women-led movement that's making history. The world has heard the chance of women
*08:59.120- 09:05.980* :  life liberty, three words that have become a rallying cry for all those standing up for equality,
*09:06.740- 09:15.160* :  for dignity and for freedom in Iran. So let's today, surprise, serve as our tribute to the brave
*09:15.160- 09:23.380* :  and defiant women, men and young people in Iran who, despite coming under increasing pressure,
*09:24.020- 09:30.480* :  are leading the push for change. The European Parliament hears you, the world sees you,
*09:30.960- 09:35.760* :  and we are with you. That was Roberta Mazzella, the President of the European Parliament on the
*09:35.760- 09:40.860* :  awarding of the Sahar of Prize to Masat Amini and the Women Life Freedom Movement in Iran.
*09:42.020- 09:46.120* :  Researchers from the International Atomic Energy Agency have, for the first time,
*09:46.120- 09:51.920* :  taken samples of fish and sea water from a port nearly devastated for Kushman nuclear power plant.
*09:52.420- 09:56.360* :  Japan has been taking regular samples since it began releasing the wastewater from the
*09:56.360- 10:02.100* :  Stricken Facility Bank in August. Shamakalil reports. In addition to sea water, the team of
*10:02.100- 10:07.720* :  scientists from China, South Korea and Canada will collect samples of fish and sea bed residue
*10:08.100- 10:13.040* :  to compare the levels of tritium and other radioactive substances from those taken last year.
*10:13.040- 10:17.260* :  The samples will be sent to labs in the respective countries for independent review.
*10:17.920- 10:22.580* :  China has sharply reacted to the discharge by imposing a blanket ban on Japanese seafood
*10:22.580- 10:27.620* :  imports. The wastewater has gone through a liquid processing system that removes most
*10:27.620- 10:33.220* :  radio nuclei except tritium. I took a correspondent, Shamakalil. Over the past decade,
*10:33.320- 10:39.340* :  there has been a wave of innovation in 3D printed guns. The weapons have been seen in the hands of
*10:39.340- 10:44.540* :  gun enthusiasts, organized criminals, paramilitaries, insurgents and terrorists across all continents.
*10:45.340- 10:50.500* :  Within this world, one pseudonymous figure has emerged as a symbol for the cause of universal
*10:50.500- 10:57.920* :  access to firearms, J. Stark 1809. He created the world's most high-tech, dangerous and
*10:57.920- 11:03.940* :  popular 3D printed gun and established an influential network. A new report published by the
*11:03.940- 11:09.120* :  International Center for the Study of Radicalization has tracked down J. Stark 1809. A German national
*11:09.460- 11:14.340* :  has links to far-right groups and is a self-identifying in-sell. That's someone who is single
*11:14.340- 11:19.380* :  but against his will. James Coppnell has been talking to Dr. Rajan Bazarah who led the research.
*11:20.220- 11:26.640* :  J. Stark, when he spoke with this pseudonym, presented himself as the champion of the right to
*11:26.640- 11:30.940* :  bear arms because he thought it was a human right for everyone to have access to a gun.
*11:32.080- 11:38.380* :  But Ivan covered messages that he wrote anonymously and they really contradict that public
*11:38.380- 11:45.400* :  persona that he presented to the world. Because anonymously, he was xenophobic, he was racist,
*11:45.420- 11:51.180* :  he made antisemitic comments and he actually endorsed far-right terrorism.
*11:52.200- 11:58.640* :  And so seeing that difference between his pseudonymous public persona and his anonymous or
*11:58.640- 12:03.960* :  seemingly anonymous comments is really quite striking. There are plenty of people on the internet
*12:04.240- 12:10.180* :  and other places with objectionable or difficult views. This person now has had a huge influence.
*12:11.400- 12:17.360* :  He has exactly. He really spearheaded this movement that is now worldwide of people who are developing
*12:17.380- 12:23.700* :  3D printed gun designs, disseminating them different parts of the internet and encouraging people
*12:23.700- 12:30.440* :  to use them. But so far, very little is actually known about his identity. When he would make
*12:30.440- 12:36.140* :  public appearances, he would wear a mask, sunglasses, he would be very cautious about revealing details
*12:36.220- 12:43.800* :  of his life. But by following an open-source trail, I've managed to locate various profiles he
*12:43.800- 12:50.920* :  had on different platforms and unmask him literally and figuratively as Jacob Doigu, who is a
*12:50.920- 12:59.120* :  German man, and he was an incel, an involuntarily celibate person, where he blamed his lack of
*12:59.120- 13:07.220* :  romantic and sexual relations on women, on feminism, on society, and he felt very emasculated
*13:07.740- 13:13.160* :  and felt that he'd lost his power as a man. And this aspect to him is totally unknown
*13:13.160- 13:19.240* :  until now. Beyond the individual, is it possible that it'll be a move to regulate this sector more
*13:19.240- 13:27.220* :  heavily? It's possible, but these guns were deliberately designed to not include regulated
*13:27.220- 13:33.900* :  components. So the main gun that he chose doesn't need anything that requires a license across
*13:33.900- 13:38.800* :  the European Union, for instance. So that makes it very difficult for the authorities to counter
*13:39.800- 13:45.620* :  the issue. And it can make it illegal to possess the digital blueprints or download them
*13:46.380- 13:52.340* :  and some countries are updating legislation to that effect. But even with that legislation in place,
*13:52.340- 13:57.360* :  it would still be difficult to counter this that really poses a challenge for law enforcement.
*13:57.900- 14:02.300* :  That was Dr. Rajan Basra. Still to come.
*14:07.980- 14:13.060* :  That was one of Italy's most popular singers who's been arrested as part of a mafia roundup.
*14:20.960- 14:25.200* :  Meanwhile, the Biden administration is easing a raft of sanctions against Venezuela,
*14:25.260- 14:30.780* :  24 hours after the government of President Maduro and the opposition agree terms for an election
*14:30.780- 14:35.040* :  next year. Mr. Maduro announced the news from the presidential palace in Caracas.
*14:35.880- 14:41.500* :  The freedom of economic freedom for investment, commerce, development and growth.
*14:42.100- 14:47.300* :  I call for a stop to our sanctions and for a steady progressive lifting of them until we get
*14:47.300- 14:52.660* :  a Venezuela absolutely free of sanctions. Ties between Caracas and Washington have been slowly
*14:52.660- 14:58.480* :  warming since early 2022 when senior U.S. officials flew there for rare talks with their
*14:58.480- 15:03.540* :  Venezuelan counterparts. Our online Latin America editor Vanessa Basluta has been following
*15:03.540- 15:09.360* :  this for the newsroom. Clearly, the sanctions that the U.S. imposed did not succeed in removing
*15:09.360- 15:15.440* :  President Maduro from office. If anything, Mr. Maduro's position and power has become more entrenched
*15:15.440- 15:21.940* :  over the recent years and he has been able to blame the dire economic situation in Venezuela
*15:21.940- 15:28.140* :  on the U.S. sanctions. So that's actually benefited him in a way. But of course, now with this
*15:28.140- 15:34.460* :  deal between the Venezuelan opposition and government representatives, the U.S. is looking towards
*15:34.460- 15:39.420* :  easing those sanctions in order to provide a incentive for the Venezuelan government
*15:39.500- 15:45.960* :  to stick to a blueprint for creating more free and fair elections in the next year.
*15:46.380- 15:49.820* :  Why now? Why in 2023 are they almost the end of the year?
*15:50.000- 15:55.000* :  Because the energy crisis sparked by Russia's war on Ukraine made the U.S. look around for
*15:55.000- 16:01.020* :  alternative sources of oil and gas. And of course, Venezuela has got the world's largest
*16:01.020- 16:06.940* :  proven reserves of oil. So that was an obvious place to go and look for new resources.
*16:07.640- 16:15.420* :  But of course, this new deal that was struck and signed on Tuesday has given the U.S. more leeway
*16:15.420- 16:21.700* :  to deal with a government that they decry as authoritarian and that they say cheated in the 2018
*16:22.440- 16:25.440* :  elections. Talks about the state of the opposition of Venezuela. Because like we say,
*16:25.440- 16:29.140* :  they had a proper China one, C. Nick was Maduro. There was a point that Kwanguaydo even tried to
*16:29.140- 16:33.960* :  kind of mobilize the military and the police to his side. That didn't come off. What state of
*16:33.960- 16:40.960* :  health is the opposition now? Kwanguaydo is now an exile in the U.S. He left in April and then in
*16:40.960- 16:47.480* :  June, he was barred from running from from office. And the opposition, which is historically always
*16:47.480- 16:53.620* :  bitterly divided, has decided to try and pull together ahead of these elections next year.
*16:53.900- 16:59.380* :  They're going to hold a primary on Sunday. The front runner is a 56-year-old woman called
*16:59.380- 17:05.840* :  Maria Corina Machado. But it has to be said she is currently still barred from running for office
*17:05.840- 17:12.080* :  because a close ally of Mr. Maduro was the controller general at the time and barred her from office.
*17:12.360- 17:16.680* :  This is something that the U.S. wants to remedy. We'll follow that story closely. That was Vanessa
*17:16.680- 17:21.860* :  Pushlukter there. On the second day of his trip to North Korea, Russia's foreign minister,
*17:21.860- 17:27.320* :  Sege Lavrov, is doubling down on his country's support. The U.S. and others he said are conducting
*17:27.320- 17:32.560* :  a dangerous policy towards North Korea that includes what he called nuclear elements. Pyongyang
*17:32.560- 17:37.240* :  meanwhile has started supplying munitions to Russia and there appears the Kremlin could reciprocate
*17:37.240- 17:42.240* :  by transferring advanced military technology. For more, I spoke to our correspondent in the region,
*17:42.240- 17:48.480* :  Jim McKenzie. As these two countries have become ever more isolated, really we've watched their
*17:48.480- 17:53.560* :  interests become more aligned, especially with the war in Ukraine basically means that both
*17:53.560- 17:58.600* :  these countries are now in confrontation with the U.S. So since the very beginning of this war,
*17:59.060- 18:04.740* :  North Korea has been one of the very few open supporters of it. But it's in the last few months
*18:04.780- 18:09.540* :  that we've really seen the countries get much closer. The pinnacle I think was that meeting between
*18:09.540- 18:14.600* :  Kim Jong Un of Vladimir Putin in Russia's Far East last month. But it is thought that this meeting
*18:14.600- 18:19.640* :  today with Lavrov in North Korea is actually paving the way for Vladimir Putin to be able to return
*18:19.640- 18:26.340* :  the favor and to visit Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. But why all the coziness now? Well, it's widely
*18:26.340- 18:31.020* :  believed that these two countries have, as you say, reached an arms deal. That North Korea has
*18:31.020- 18:35.960* :  essentially agreed to send ammunition to Russia to help it continue fighting its war in Ukraine.
*18:36.080- 18:41.380* :  And that in return, it's going to get money, but possibly even military equipment, military
*18:41.380- 18:45.360* :  equipment that it desires. You're speaking to us from South Korea. How do
*18:45.360- 18:50.720* :  neighbouring nations like South Korea like Japan view this increasingly close relationship?
*18:51.060- 18:57.480* :  They certainly watch with unease. I mean, there are questions here about how far Russia would go,
*18:57.480- 19:01.620* :  you know, in terms of supporting North Korea, you know, certainly politicians in South Korea,
*19:01.840- 19:06.740* :  they do scratch their heads a bit. They can't quite understand why Russia would be prepared to,
*19:06.740- 19:11.800* :  for example, send North Korea advance military technology. It's just not in Russia's interests
*19:11.800- 19:18.740* :  to make North Korea any more dangerous than it already is. It really is seen that Russia is using
*19:18.740- 19:23.320* :  this relationship, not just to get the ammunition and the artillery that it needs for the war,
*19:23.420- 19:30.160* :  but really as a means to put pressure on the US, to show the US that it has the potential to destabilize
*19:30.160- 19:34.780* :  the situation here in North East Asia. You know, I think people here feel that Russia is quite
*19:34.780- 19:39.340* :  enjoying being able to needle the US and to show it is able to influence this region.
*19:39.480- 19:42.700* :  And then you have North Korea, which is under these incredibly strict sanctions.
*19:43.280- 19:47.680* :  So at the moment, it's looking for all the help it can get. And if it can get military support
*19:47.680- 19:52.680* :  from Russia, then that really strengthens its hand. That was Jim McKenzie there. Well, let's stick
*19:52.720- 19:57.060* :  in the region because leaders from across the world have been meeting in Beijing this week to
*19:57.060- 20:02.360* :  mark 10 years of China's Belt and Road Initiative. The trillion dollar program has brought new
*20:02.360- 20:06.820* :  infrastructure to more than 100 countries, most of them in the developing world. One of the most
*20:06.820- 20:12.400* :  recent projects is Indonesia's Wush, which is Southeast Asia's first ever high-speed rail line.
*20:12.400- 20:18.040* :  But like many Chinese backed BRI projects, it's not without controversy. Our Asia Business
*20:18.040- 20:22.820* :  Correspondent Nick Marsh was one of the first people to take a ride and sent this report from Jakarta.
*20:22.840- 20:31.720* :  Southeast Asia has got its first high-speed rail line. It's faster than anything in the US,
*20:32.520- 20:37.540* :  faster than anything in the UK. It's appropriately called Wush, and it connects the Indonesian
*20:37.600- 20:45.000* :  capital Jakarta with the city of Bandung. It's Chinese made with the top speed of 350 kilometres
*20:45.000- 20:50.060* :  an hour, and it turns what was a three-hour journey into a four to five-minute route.
*20:55.040- 21:00.200* :  I don't leave for another half an hour, but there's already hundreds of people queuing up to go
*21:00.200- 21:06.780* :  through the ticket barriers. Lots of them are wearing brightly coloured traditional batty shirts,
*21:07.580- 21:12.640* :  which is what you wear on formal occasions here in Indonesia. Got some people are laughing, smiling,
*21:13.520- 21:16.780* :  everyone's in a really good mood. You're looking forward to getting on the train?
*21:20.900- 21:26.680* :  This woman was taking selfies with her friends. She told me that she and a hundred colleagues from
*21:26.680- 21:32.860* :  the local university had decided that they wanted to experience Wush. Then it was time to get on.
*21:33.080- 21:33.780* :  Thank you.
*21:37.020- 21:42.940* :  Good morning to you about the chance. Wush is actually an acronym in the Indonesian language.
*21:42.940- 21:49.380* :  It means time-saving and reliable. Now this of course is yet another belt and road initiative
*21:49.380- 21:53.820* :  project. It's 60% Indonesian owned, 40% Chinese owned.
*21:56.920- 22:02.760* :  But actually this really wasn't supposed to have been built by China. Japan with their famous
*22:02.760- 22:07.780* :  shinkansen rail system, they were the heavy favorites to win the bid. They said that they'd
*22:07.780- 22:13.520* :  financed the project at basically 0% interest, but they did need a guarantee from the Indonesian
*22:13.520- 22:18.340* :  government that they'd step in with money if anything went wrong. But then China came in with a
*22:18.340- 22:22.800* :  counter offer. They said we're going to build this cheaper or build it quicker and we don't need
*22:22.800- 22:28.420* :  any guarantee from the Indonesian government, but they did want 2% interest on their loan.
*22:29.100- 22:35.660* :  Well, Indonesia picked China to many people's surprise, but in the end this project is 3 years late,
*22:35.880- 22:41.840* :  it's $2 billion over budget and the interest rate's gone up to 3.4%. Oh, and the Indonesian
*22:41.840- 22:44.100* :  government did have to fork out some money in the air.
*22:48.720- 22:54.680* :  Seems like some people on board just love the name. Others are happy that Indonesia are the trailblazers
*22:54.680- 22:58.420* :  in the region. Good for a government economy. Good for a government economy.
*23:00.020- 23:05.880* :  Ticket pricing is controversial. A journey to Bandung costs about 20 US dollars. That's
*23:05.880- 23:12.780* :  5 times more expensive than taking the bus. I also found out from personal experience that the
*23:12.780- 23:19.000* :  train doesn't actually take you to Bandung City Centre. You actually end up in a suburb nearly an
*23:19.000- 23:25.080* :  hour away. We're in Bandung. It's pretty fast. I've got to say. And to be fair,
*23:25.540- 23:29.860* :  this isn't the first railway line in the world. That's late or over budget.
*23:30.300- 23:35.500* :  Countries like Indonesia, a hungry for infrastructure in China, can provide that infrastructure.
*23:35.500- 23:40.720* :  When it goes well, it's a win-win. The problem is that when things don't go according to plan,
*23:40.720- 23:47.700* :  the risks, politically, economic, environmental, it do seem to be a bit one-sided. But that's simply
*23:47.700- 23:51.660* :  something that Indonesia was willing to accept when it jumped on the BRI train.
*23:52.840- 23:58.280* :  Our man on the train, Nick Marsh. And finally, one of Italy's most popular romantic singers has
*23:58.280- 24:04.060* :  been arrested as part of a mafia roundup in Naples. Tony Colombo is known for leading the
*24:04.060- 24:08.700* :  Nier Melodica pop genre that's really quite big in southern Italy. His latest song, which
*24:08.700- 24:13.840* :  translates to, I'm waiting for you at the altar, has had almost 60 million hits on YouTube.
*24:19.740- 24:24.200* :  Some classic crueaning action there, I think. Well, Stephanie Prentiss told me more about the singer.
*24:24.500- 24:29.400* :  Tony Colombo is a very mainstream singer in Italy, particularly popular in Naples. He sings a lot
*24:29.400- 24:34.980* :  about love, romantic longing. He's released more than 20 albums and performed around the world,
*24:34.980- 24:40.700* :  but he's now accused of having ties to the De La Roe clan. That's a powerful group within
*24:40.700- 24:45.620* :  the Camorra Mafia in Naples, and investigators are now looking into his investments that could be
*24:45.620- 24:51.160* :  linked to it. They say he may have invested in mafia businesses, so seemingly legal and above
*24:51.160- 24:57.700* :  more brands, that companies have used creating using drug profits. So one is the Corleone clothing line,
*24:57.700- 25:03.560* :  seemingly a godfather film reference. They think he might have invested more than 500,000
*25:03.560- 25:09.820* :  dollars in that, as well as an energy drink, called 9mm. The other main allegation against
*25:09.820- 25:15.240* :  Tony Colombo is that he received illicit funds and disguised them as profits for his musical career.
*25:15.780- 25:21.180* :  Now, he also married a woman in 2019, a widow of a mafia boss. He had a wedding with mafia
*25:21.180- 25:26.900* :  members attending, and she's been arrested too, facing similar allegations. Both them, however,
*25:26.900- 25:31.360* :  are denying any involvement in organised crime. Worth noting, though, isn't it, that this isn't
*25:31.360- 25:35.800* :  the only mafia crackdown of the year? Well, at all. So we've seen a number of high profile and
*25:35.800- 25:40.620* :  successful raids on mafia clans this year, the Andringeta Mafia. They're being cracked down on
*25:40.620- 25:45.320* :  they've been a number of arrests, including some of their main players. That is that really powerful
*25:45.320- 25:50.540* :  group known as being the centre of a global spiderweb of drug trafficking. More than 50 people
*25:50.540- 25:56.320* :  arrested last month from that clan in 38 put in prison. And Pasquale Bonnevote, he ran the group,
*25:56.320- 26:01.600* :  he was arrested in April after being on the run for around five years. So this latest round of
*26:01.600- 26:07.080* :  arrests, including, of course, Tony Colombo is in keeping with a widespread crackdown in Italy.
*26:07.240- 26:11.900* :  Stephanie Prentice And that's all from us for now, but there will be
*26:11.900- 26:15.300* :  a new edition of the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this one,
