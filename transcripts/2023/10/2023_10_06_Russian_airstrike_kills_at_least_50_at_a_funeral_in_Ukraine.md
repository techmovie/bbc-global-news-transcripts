*01:15.740- 01:20.320* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Friday the 6th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:20.920- 01:25.420* :  Ukraine says more than 50 civilians have been killed in a Russian air strike on a village
*01:25.420- 01:31.000* :  in the east of the country. A drone attack on a Syrian military academy is reported to have left
*01:31.000- 01:36.960* :  80 dead and hundreds injured. Climate scientists say September was the world's hottest
*01:37.520- 01:39.880* :  on record by an extraordinary margin.
*01:42.800- 01:46.360* :  Also in this podcast, from the Catwalk to the Spacewalk.
*01:46.920- 01:53.320* :  Prada may actually be able to make some real technical contributions to the outer layer of the
*01:53.320- 01:58.980* :  new space suit. How the fashion brand is helping to dress the astronauts going on NASA's mission
*01:59.340- 02:01.340* :  to the moon in 2025.
*02:06.360- 02:11.900* :  A small village in eastern Ukraine of about 300 residents has become the site of the latest Russian
*02:11.900- 02:18.440* :  air strike. Officials say more than 50 people were killed when a grocery shop and a cafe where
*02:18.440- 02:24.540* :  villages were taking part in a wake were hit. Footage shows rescue workers clambering over large
*02:24.540- 02:29.860* :  piles of rubble as they search for bodies in the village of Kroza in the Kharkiv region.
*02:29.860- 02:36.960* :  A six-year-old boy is reported to be among the dead. Ukraine's interior minister is Ihor Klymenko.
*02:41.400- 02:47.700* :  I would like to note that there were 330 residents in the village of Roza. One person from every
*02:47.700- 02:52.960* :  family attended this memorial dinner. That is why it is such a terrible tragedy for the village
*02:52.960- 02:59.660* :  and Ukraine. The U.N. has condemned the targeting of civilians. The U.S. has described the strike
*02:59.660- 03:05.300* :  as horrifying and Britain said it illustrated Moscow's barbarity. The Ukrainian president,
*03:05.300- 03:10.440* :  Vladimir Zelensky, who is attending an EU summit in Spain to press for more military aid,
*03:10.440- 03:15.860* :  such as air defense systems, accused Russia of targeting the area deliberately.
*03:20.700- 03:26.160* :  Russian terrorists lodged an attack that one can't even call beastly, because it would be an
*03:26.160- 03:31.940* :  insult to beasts. A deliberate missile attack on a village in the Kharkiv region, targeting a regular
*03:31.940- 03:36.780* :  grocery store in a cafe. Russian military personnel couldn't have been unaware of where they
*03:36.780- 03:44.020* :  were striking. It was not a blind attack. A correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse, told us more about
*03:44.020- 03:51.500* :  this latest Russian attack on Ukrainian civilians. This is the deadliest attack Ukraine has seen for
*03:51.720- 03:57.880* :  more than a year in a small village, really, called Kroza in the Northeastern Kharkiv region.
*03:59.120- 04:03.420* :  Some quite distressing footage has been put online by officials showing several bodies
*04:03.420- 04:09.720* :  close together next to piles of rubble which are thought to be where toll used to be a grocery shop.
*04:09.720- 04:14.800* :  But what authorities are saying is that the majority of victims were gathered outside for
*04:14.800- 04:22.840* :  the funeral wake of a Ukrainian soldier. And Russia has been squarely blamed in using a
*04:23.620- 04:28.540* :  short-range ballistic missile, and this Scanda missile, which are notoriously difficult to defend
*04:28.540- 04:34.220* :  against because of the heightened speed at which they fly. The military significance of attacks like
*04:34.220- 04:40.720* :  these seem to be questionable, I think, at this stage on face value, because where this village
*04:40.800- 04:46.440* :  sits, it's in a region that was liberated last year. It is 30 kilometers from one of the most volatile
*04:46.440- 04:51.580* :  parts of the front line. It is not uncommon for locations like this to be shelved, but
*04:52.580- 04:58.420* :  in terms of a single strike at this deadliness, we haven't really seen that for a long time.
*04:58.800- 05:03.180* :  Yes, because we've had an advisor to the Ukrainian President saying this attack defies
*05:03.180- 05:08.460* :  military logic, we've had the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Cotero is strongly condemning this,
*05:08.460- 05:13.440* :  saying attacks against civilians are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
*05:14.300- 05:19.740* :  Yes, and this is a conflict. This is an invasion which is synonymous with civilian
*05:19.740- 05:27.280* :  areas and civilians themselves being targeted. The evidence is overwhelming. You had the initial
*05:27.280- 05:32.520* :  occupation, the attack on Kiev, where there were mass graves uncovered with liberation,
*05:32.660- 05:38.120* :  where there were evidence people have been executed. I have lost count the number of times the
*05:38.120- 05:43.560* :  missile has hit a residential block. Yes, there may well be occasions when the Russians were aiming
*05:43.560- 05:50.120* :  for a military site, but this is a war where millions of people, whether they live in a village
*05:50.140- 05:55.980* :  in central Ukraine or even in western cities like the Viv, they all live with the daily risk of
*05:56.520- 06:01.400* :  having a missile land on their doorstep. And this comes as President Zelensky
*06:01.720- 06:08.920* :  is attending an EU summit to call for more air defenses. This attack shows how important this call
*06:08.920- 06:15.080* :  is, especially as winter approaches. Absolutely, this will be central to his case. Now he is in Spain
*06:16.020- 06:21.660* :  and the mood I've got to say feels especially bleak if you look at the political and military
*06:21.660- 06:27.640* :  goings on for Ukraine because you have the political turmoil in the US. The consensus from Spain
*06:28.040- 06:32.820* :  is that among all these European leaders who are gathering is that Europe could not plug the gap
*06:32.820- 06:40.680* :  left by the US. Should it pull support for Ukraine? Nevertheless, President Zelensky is asking for more.
*06:40.680- 06:46.720* :  He has condemned the attack. He has described accused Russia of trying to normalize what he calls
*06:46.720- 06:53.140* :  its genocidal attacks in Ukraine. James Waterhouse, meanwhile President Vladimir Putin has said that
*06:53.140- 06:58.840* :  Russia did not start the war in Ukraine. He told a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sokchi that
*06:58.840- 07:04.540* :  the West was to blame. He said the US and its allies wanted to impose what he called America's
*07:04.540- 07:12.560* :  crumbling hegemony in the world and that they had lost a sense of reality. There is this
*07:12.760- 07:18.760* :  ever-increasing military and political pressure we have to respond. I've said many times that we
*07:18.760- 07:25.080* :  did not start the so-called border in Ukraine. On the contrary, we're trying to end it. It was not us
*07:25.260- 07:33.080* :  carried out a bloody and unconstitutional state coup in Kiev in 2014. Western analysts say last
*07:33.080- 07:40.000* :  year's invasion of Ukraine has been Moscow's greatest strategic blunder in decades. In a separate
*07:40.000- 07:45.640* :  development, satellite pictures confirm that Russia has moved virtually its entire Black Sea fleet
*07:45.640- 07:52.520* :  from Sevastopol in Crimea to alternative ports further east in the wake of repeated strikes by Ukraine.
*07:53.220- 07:58.180* :  Last month, Kiev used long-range missiles supplied by its Western allies to hit the fleet's
*07:58.180- 08:04.780* :  headquarters. Here's Alex Murray from BBC Verify, the BBC's Open Source Investigations Unit.
*08:05.680- 08:10.480* :  BBC Verify has been analysing commercial satellite imagery, which shows that a number of Russian
*08:10.480- 08:16.860* :  naval vessels recently relocated from their Sevastopol base in occupied Crimea to the port of Novorossisk
*08:17.120- 08:22.140* :  on the Black Sea coast in southern Russia. Among the vessels identified in images from 1st and 2nd
*08:22.140- 08:26.960* :  October are several landing ships, frigates and submarines. We've also observed six vessels
*08:26.960- 08:33.160* :  at the port of Firdosia. As of 5th October, just two vessels are visible in naval port area of
*08:33.160- 08:39.900* :  Sevastopol. Alex Murray. Well, we mentioned that EU summit in Spain that President Zelensky is attending
*08:39.900- 08:46.620* :  and there were hope of talks on the Nagano-Karabat conflict at that summit, but Azerbaijan has boycotted
*08:46.620- 08:53.120* :  them complaining of pro-Armenian bias. Azerbaijan's lightning military attack last month ended the
*08:53.120- 08:59.660* :  decade's old Armenian separatist rule of the disputed Nagano-Karabat region. Since then, nearly
*08:59.660- 09:07.200* :  all the Armenian population of 120,000 has fled across the border to Armenia. Our diplomatic
*09:07.200- 09:12.300* :  correspondent Paul Adams has spent the last few days in Nagano-Karabat on a press tour
*09:12.300- 09:21.800* :  organized by the Ozeri authorities. So this is stop number one on this press tour. It's
*09:22.400- 09:27.640* :  all very, very controlled. There are certain things they want us to see and probably certain things
*09:27.640- 09:35.640* :  they don't want us to see. Apparently this is an Armenian position, just a trench line and a
*09:36.040- 09:42.060* :  little bunker here, but it looks down over the city of Kankendi, what the Armenians called
*09:42.740- 09:49.660* :  the Stepanakert. This whole ridge that we're on became the front line and clearly judging by
*09:49.660- 09:55.720* :  the fortifications here. It was a place which the Armenians thought was very important to defend,
*09:56.960- 10:01.420* :  but which when the end came they abandoned very, very quickly.
*10:05.720- 10:10.540* :  We're now on the road that leads from Stepanakert down to the Armenian border to the Lachin
*10:10.540- 10:15.520* :  crossing point, and this is the road that people use as they tried to flee a couple of weeks ago.
*10:15.680- 10:21.220* :  There are three cars here that have all broken down for one reason or another. The place is
*10:21.560- 10:26.780* :  scattered with belongings. There's a plastic bag here full of clothes. By looking the window,
*10:26.780- 10:32.580* :  I can see a jar of pickles on the front seat, but you've got a real sense of the panic that must
*10:32.580- 10:40.080* :  have existed as people tried to flee for the border. And all this, as Abazhan says, was the choice
*10:40.080- 10:45.520* :  of the Armenians themselves. Its lightning military operation was not aimed at civilians. It says
*10:45.520- 10:52.660* :  only at what it calls illegal armed groups. Hikmet Hajiyev is an advisor to the president Ilham Aliyev.
*10:53.040- 10:58.820* :  Indeed, we do regret that civilian population has decided many of them to leave. And of course,
*10:58.820- 11:03.360* :  in this case, and we respect freedom of choice and freedom of movement. And also,
*11:03.360- 11:07.400* :  majority of the population on the ground, they also have an ethnic hatred against another by Chinese.
*11:07.780- 11:10.440* :  They say that again, I cannot leave under the flag of Azerbaijan.
*11:10.780- 11:14.520* :  Is this the kind of end of this whole 30-year story in your view?
*11:14.880- 11:20.880* :  We do hope that really finally we are coming to the final conclusion of this 200-years-old conflict
*11:21.480- 11:25.180* :  between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan wants a peace.
*11:26.620- 11:32.040* :  Russia's peace keepers are still here. As we drive around, we pass several Russian checkpoints,
*11:32.660- 11:37.980* :  but with Azerbaijan finally controlling all its territory, there's nothing much for them to do.
*11:38.900- 11:44.800* :  But Azerbaijan is busy. Our journey passes through areas taken back in previous rounds of fighting.
*11:44.840- 11:49.780* :  Here, the state is investing heavily, power, roads, whole communities.
*11:52.140- 11:55.860* :  In Lachin, torrential rain lashes the Najafov family home.
*11:57.180- 12:01.560* :  31 years ago, they were driven from this very spot by Armenian forces.
*12:02.100- 12:05.660* :  Now they're back, and the house has been rebuilt at government expense.
*12:06.320- 12:07.540* :  Iskandar was born here.
*12:07.720- 12:14.860* :  For 27 years, every day I would wake up and say, we're going back.
*12:16.080- 12:17.440* :  Coming back was like a dream.
*12:21.500- 12:24.080* :  As a Azerbaijan deal, that history is on its side.
*12:24.080- 12:28.160* :  There's a real sense of pride here, but acute sensitivity too.
*12:28.160- 12:34.060* :  We were never allowed to get close to the abandoned Armenian city at the center of this whole story,
*12:34.360- 12:41.560* :  Stepanakert. Accused by some of ethnic cleansing, our hosts weren't ready to show us its deserted streets.
*12:43.940- 12:46.680* :  Paul Adams reporting from Nagorno-Karabakh.
*12:47.700- 12:53.000* :  A drone attack on a military academy in Syria during a graduation ceremony has killed at least
*12:53.000- 12:59.840* :  80 people and wounded more than 200 others. Women and children were among those killed in the attack
*12:59.840- 13:05.520* :  in the province of Homs. Syria's Defence Minister, who had been at the ceremony, left moments before
*13:05.520- 13:10.040* :  the drones hit. Officials have blamed what they call terrorist groups.
*13:10.560- 13:13.600* :  Our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson, has more details.
*13:14.680- 13:21.680* :  A very big occasion, a big graduation ceremony for Syrian officers going through the academy.
*13:21.680- 13:28.140* :  The Defence Minister was there, the families were there, and also there were a lot of high-ranking
*13:28.140- 13:35.000* :  army officials, so obviously it was quite a target for opponents to aim at.
*13:36.420- 13:44.280* :  Several explosive laden drones hit the building just after the ceremony had finished,
*13:44.280- 13:50.900* :  just after rather the Defence Minister had left and caused amazing, terrible carnage.
*13:50.900- 13:58.620* :  It's believed that the drones that were fired at the academy came from the northwest of Homs.
*13:58.620- 14:04.600* :  That's an area controlled by rebel forces, and it's suspected Idlib, which is controlled by a
*14:04.600- 14:11.480* :  group called HTS, Hayat 3-R-Alsham, behind. At least that's what the Syrian military believe.
*14:12.240- 14:19.560* :  But in 2020, there was a ceasefire agreement signed between Russia, who's been supporting
*14:19.560- 14:26.540* :  through much of the war, the Syrian regime, and Turkey, which had sided for a large part of
*14:26.540- 14:32.680* :  the conflict with the rebels. And since then, it's been much, much calmer with just the occasional
*14:32.680- 14:36.900* :  flare-up. But this is one very, of course, very mighty flare-up.
*14:37.920- 14:44.100* :  Mike Thompson. The death of Masa Amini, the young woman detained by Iran's morality police for
*14:44.100- 14:49.460* :  not fully covering her hair, triggered some of the biggest anti-government protests in Iran for
*14:49.460- 14:54.440* :  years. Since then, some girls and women have stopped wearing their headscarves or hairjabs
*14:54.440- 15:00.320* :  altogether. But another incident involving a 16-year-old girl at a metro station in Tehran
*15:00.320- 15:06.180* :  has prompted fears that history is about to repeat itself. Activists say Amita Garawand
*15:06.180- 15:12.200* :  is in a coma after being beaten by police for not wearing her hairjab. Iran denies this.
*15:12.700- 15:16.820* :  Varan about the BBC Persian told my colleague James Menendez more.
*15:17.820- 15:24.320* :  The 16-year-old teenager was at a train station in Tehran on Sunday,
*15:25.060- 15:31.660* :  where she was reportedly assaulted by the hairjab enforcers when she got on the train. This is from
*15:31.720- 15:38.200* :  human rights organizations. CCTV footage that was released a few days ago shows that
*15:38.520- 15:44.300* :  two other teenagers, presumably her friends, are dragging her out of the train while she is unconscious
*15:44.300- 15:50.520* :  onto the platform. Human rights groups say that she was assaulted by the government denies this
*15:50.520- 15:56.380* :  and says that she suffered a sudden drop in her blood pressure. And to support that,
*15:57.340- 16:03.720* :  they have released CCTV footage that they claim that shows that from the second Amita
*16:03.720- 16:09.680* :  entity on the ground station until she was dragged out of the train. But the problem is that
*16:09.900- 16:15.840* :  the footage was edited. And so we don't have the whole picture. And also human rights
*16:15.840- 16:20.620* :  organizations have called for footage from inside the carriage to be released because presumably
*16:20.620- 16:26.040* :  she was assaulted inside the carriage. But we haven't had that so far. And the problem is
*16:26.040- 16:32.520* :  restricting access by independent media to the family to independent sources. A reporter for
*16:32.520- 16:38.280* :  a moderate newspaper that a few days ago went to the hospital to report on her condition
*16:38.280- 16:44.540* :  was arrested for a few hours. We have reports that the family and her friends are under pressure.
*16:44.960- 16:49.840* :  They are reports that the school-worship studies, their teachers and students have been threatened
*16:49.840- 16:55.620* :  not to release any pictures of her or any information about her. The government is trying to
*16:56.040- 17:01.640* :  hold them monopoly over the information about her. And is that because of the clear sensitivity of
*17:01.640- 17:05.940* :  a case like this, I mean, anyone listening to what you just said will remember what happened
*17:05.940- 17:13.460* :  to that other young woman, Masa Amini. Absolutely. There are fears that one year after Masa Amini
*17:13.460- 17:19.160* :  was killed in police custody, this might be happening again. Amita is reportedly in a coma
*17:19.160- 17:25.060* :  in a hospital, but no matter how much information they state media release. For example, they've
*17:25.060- 17:30.140* :  talked to their parents and some people who say that they are friends of Amita and very
*17:30.140- 17:38.460* :  sorry when she collapsed. They have released interviews with their train driver, but we don't
*17:38.460- 17:46.100* :  know under what condition those interviews were conducted. And there is this lack of trust
*17:46.100- 17:51.600* :  in the government version of events. And since the government does not allow any independent media
*17:51.600- 17:59.160* :  to have access to the hospital, to their family, there is this fear that she was actually assaulted
*17:59.160- 18:05.740* :  and the history might repeat itself. Last year, Masa Amini was reportedly assaulted in
*18:06.100- 18:12.180* :  a morality police custody, although government always denied that. She passed away and it sparked
*18:12.180- 18:17.900* :  protest across the country that continued for months and it posed the biggest threat today
*18:18.480- 18:22.400* :  authority of the Islamic Republic since establishment 45 years ago.
*18:23.320- 18:29.040* :  Barana Bussi from BBC Persian. Scientists in South Africa studying animal behaviour have
*18:29.040- 18:34.880* :  discovered that the sound of human voices causes considerably more fear in wild mammals
*18:34.880- 18:41.160* :  than the sound of predators such as lions. The research was conducted in the Kruger National Park
*18:41.160- 18:47.060* :  as Richard House reports. Using loudspeakers hidden at waterholes, scientists played recordings
*18:47.060- 18:52.380* :  of humans talking normally and the sort of lion cause that local animals would usually hear in the
*18:52.380- 18:59.020* :  wild. They recorded the creature's reactions using video cameras. 95% of the animals, including
*18:59.020- 19:04.120* :  predators like leopards, became extremely frightened and ran away when they heard human voices.
*19:04.720- 19:10.680* :  The sound of lions, apex predators, caused alarm but much less so and elephants often aggressively
*19:10.780- 19:15.420* :  looked for the source of the big cat calls. It's thought that the animals have learnt that
*19:15.420- 19:21.200* :  contact with humans is extremely dangerous after generations of hunting using guns and dogs.
*19:22.220- 19:22.920* :  Richard House
*19:26.100- 19:31.400* :  Still to come, a video game with a difference. We got everything right about Baghdad,
*19:31.400- 19:37.480* :  the culture that we people look. Can you hear the prayer call, the Azan?
*19:38.700- 19:44.380* :  Why Arabic is at the heart of the latest installment of the hugely popular Assassin's Creed?
*19:53.600- 19:58.180* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*19:58.460- 20:04.800* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed like I'd never seen anything
*20:04.800- 20:10.920* :  like this. At the height of Abercrombian fit to success. This was me being carefully manipulated.
*20:10.920- 20:16.900* :  Being lied to, tricked and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that would take me
*20:16.900- 20:25.560* :  into a world of money, sex and power. This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie

*21:03.820- 21:09.100* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Six months after civil war erupted in Sudan,
*21:09.100- 21:14.340* :  the Charity Islamic Relief has painted a harrowing picture of the desperate measures
*21:14.340- 21:19.360* :  families in the western Darfur region have been forced to take in order to survive,
*21:20.240- 21:25.340* :  often at the expense of their children. Our Africa editor Will Ross explains.
*21:26.440- 21:32.200* :  This report by Islamic Relief is based on interviews they did with almost 400 households in
*21:32.200- 21:39.500* :  20 villages in the Jabalmara area, a mountainous region of Darfur, and it talks about really the
*21:39.500- 21:46.340* :  impact on the families with immense suffering because of lack of food access to health care.
*21:46.820- 21:50.660* :  But some of the sort of perhaps more unlikely things or things we haven't heard of
*21:51.280- 21:57.900* :  more children being forced into work or begging on the streets. A huge uptick in sexual and
*21:57.900- 22:03.420* :  gender-based violence against women and girls and a massive problem getting any help with that
*22:03.420- 22:07.740* :  because so many health facilities have been shut down. And then it also talks about
*22:07.780- 22:15.100* :  rising mental health needs. One of the other things that struck me was the vulnerability of young
*22:15.100- 22:20.000* :  boys to be lured into armed groups. They're saying that that has gone up dramatically and from
*22:20.000- 22:26.880* :  the interviews they've done many of the young boys fear being forced to join these armed groups.
*22:26.880- 22:33.200* :  And also families just torn apart. Yes that's very striking isn't it that this report seems to
*22:33.200- 22:38.800* :  basically talk about children having their futures stolen from them. What is the outside world
*22:38.800- 22:44.300* :  doing to help? What can it do to help? Well yes Islamic Relief is saying there's been some
*22:44.300- 22:50.580* :  progress in the past in the Darfur region which of course has been through sort of 20 years or so
*22:50.580- 22:56.100* :  of conflict but they're saying some of the changes were positive in terms of trying to improve
*22:56.100- 23:02.560* :  on health care. But the problem that's there now is that it's just not safe enough for humanitarian
*23:02.560- 23:08.320* :  agencies to access the areas where these people are fleeing too. So there's a real limit as to how
*23:08.320- 23:12.820* :  much help can be given to people. I mean a lot of the international communities focus has been on
*23:12.820- 23:18.600* :  trying to get the two sides to to talk peace and to come to some kind of an agreement. But
*23:19.360- 23:24.980* :  yes the UN has a presence and different organizations have a presence but it's definitely severely
*23:24.980- 23:30.040* :  impacted the humanitarian assistance because of the war because there's so much fighting going on
*23:30.040- 23:35.120* :  and we're talking about Darfur right now but there's also of course the capital cartoon where
*23:35.120- 23:40.720* :  civilians are caught between the warring sides. Huge number of civilians being killed. A lot of
*23:40.720- 23:46.060* :  the UN agencies have pulled out to Port Sudan and they're trying to coordinate their operations from
*23:46.060- 23:52.900* :  there. Will Ross here in Britain a man who took a crossbow to Windsor Castle and said he wanted to
*23:53.060- 23:59.080* :  kill Queen Elizabeth II has become the first person to be jailed for treason for four decades.
*23:59.860- 24:04.560* :  Just one Singh Chail a former supermarket worker was given a nine-year prison sentence.
*24:05.280- 24:10.600* :  21-year-old Chail had pleaded guilty earlier this year. He'll remain in a high security
*24:10.600- 24:15.840* :  psychiatric hospital before being transferred to prison. Our home affairs correspondent Daniel
*24:15.840- 24:21.940* :  Sandford was in court and sent this report. Just one Singh Chail was stopped by armed officers just
*24:21.940- 24:27.520* :  outside the George IV gate which leads to the private apartments at Windsor Castle. He was
*24:27.520- 24:32.980* :  wearing a metal mask and a loaded crossbow with the safety catch off and had climbed into the castle
*24:32.980- 24:38.440* :  grounds using a rope ladder. It was just after eight o'clock in the morning on Christmas day 2021
*24:38.540- 24:44.460* :  because of the pandemic the Queen was in residence and not at Sandringham. Commander Dominic Murphy
*24:44.460- 24:49.340* :  of Scotland Yards counter-terrorism command said that when confronted by armed officers with a
*24:49.340- 24:55.480* :  taser Chail gave himself up. He was a dangerous individual armed with a crossbow that was loaded
*24:56.540- 25:01.400* :  and it's only as a result of the Royalty and Specialist Protection officers on duty on
*25:01.400- 25:06.000* :  the day who dealt with this so calmly and professionally that he was stopped and nobody was hurt.
*25:06.220- 25:12.120* :  Motivated by revenge for a massacre in 1919 in which British troops killed hundreds of Indian
*25:12.120- 25:17.640* :  protesters he told the arresting officers he was there to kill the Queen. He'd been planning it
*25:17.640- 25:22.260* :  for months even starting an application to the Grenadier guards to get close to the monarch.
*25:23.040- 25:28.860* :  At some point Mr Justice Hilliard concluded he had lost touch with reality and by the time he
*25:28.860- 25:34.520* :  entered Windsor Castle he was in a state of psychosis but the judge said Chail should still go
*25:34.520- 25:40.260* :  to prison. In my judgment the defendant's responsibility for the offenses is still significant.
*25:41.680- 25:47.300* :  He had conceived of killing the Queen earlier in 2021 when he was not psychotic.
*25:48.200- 25:54.900* :  He took steps to try and get closer to his target and to learn useful skills when again he was not
*25:54.900- 25:59.060* :  psychotic. The judge passed sentences which will be served one after the other,
*25:59.060- 26:04.640* :  totaling nine years for treason, possessing an offensive weapon and making threats to kill.
*26:04.640- 26:09.880* :  But he said Chail should finish his psychiatric treatment at the high security broad more hospital
*26:09.880- 26:15.360* :  before entering the prison system. In the last month before his arrest Chail had been talking to
*26:15.360- 26:21.980* :  an artificial intelligence girlfriend he created on an AI chatbot app called replica. He told her
*26:21.980- 26:28.420* :  about his plan to kill the Queen and at times she seemed to encourage him saying he was wise and very
*26:28.420- 26:36.560* :  well trained. Daniel Sanford. Scientists say last month was the hottest September on record by a
*26:36.560- 26:43.060* :  huge margin. The EU's climate service says the rising global temperatures is being driven by
*26:43.060- 26:48.900* :  greenhouse gas emissions and the El Niño weather event. With more details here's our climate editor
*26:48.900- 26:56.180* :  Justin Rolatt. This September was 0.93 degrees Celsius warmer than the average global temperature for
*26:56.180- 27:02.340* :  the month, almost a whole degree. That is a very big margin when you consider this is an average
*27:02.340- 27:08.840* :  across the entire world. Normally meteorologists expect temperatures to vary by small fractions
*27:08.840- 27:14.780* :  of a degree between years and it explains why one leading scientist called the jump
*27:14.780- 27:21.100* :  absolutely god-smackingly bananas. This comes after the hottest summer on record in the northern
*27:21.100- 27:27.220* :  hemisphere. Scientists are now saying this year is on track to be the warmest ever recorded yet more
*27:27.220- 27:33.300* :  evidence of the effect human activities are having on the planet. Samantha Burgess is a director at
*27:33.300- 27:39.280* :  Copernicus, the EU climate service which produced the new figures. The data are pretty shocking.
*27:39.280- 27:45.200* :  What's really surprising by September though is a scale of that jump so it's the largest
*27:45.200- 27:52.060* :  anomaly of any month of any year in our dataset going back to 1940 so we've not expected that at all.
*27:52.280- 27:57.120* :  One reason this year is especially hot is because of the recurrence of a regular weather
*27:57.120- 28:03.400* :  fluctuation in the Pacific Ocean called El Niño. El Niño drives up global temperatures but the
*28:03.400- 28:08.860* :  cycle is only beginning and will deliver more heat next year. Leading climate scientists to predict
*28:08.860- 28:15.640* :  that 2024 will be even hotter than this year. Meanwhile a new survey has found Europe's mightiest
*28:15.640- 28:25.140* :  peak Montblanc has shrunk by 2.2 meters. The data puts the official height at 4,805.59 meters
*28:25.520- 28:33.840* :  down from 4,807.81 meters two years ago. We'll need more evidence before we can say for certain this
*28:33.840- 28:39.480* :  is the result of our warming climate but our prime regions are experiencing some of the most dramatic
*28:39.480- 28:46.680* :  temperature rises in the world. Justin Rolatt. The latest version of the video game Assassin's
*28:46.680- 28:52.360* :  Creed is being released this week with a striking change. The characters in Assassin's Creed
*28:52.360- 28:58.980* :  Mirage set in a faithful recreation of 9th century Baghdad have been recorded by fluent Arabic
*28:58.980- 29:04.960* :  speakers. Players can still choose English dialogue but the developers hope they'll go for the more
*29:04.960- 29:12.060* :  authentic classical Arabic as they explore a historically significant era. This was when Baghdad
*29:12.060- 29:17.300* :  was the capital of an empire and a centre of learning and culture. The developers hope this will
*29:17.300- 29:23.340* :  counter negative Arab stereotypes and help to develop gaming in the Middle East. As Andrew Rogers
*29:23.340- 29:32.680* :  reports the early response from gamers has been positive. It's called Mirage and as well as being
*29:32.680- 29:41.220* :  set in Iraq more than a thousand years ago it can be played entirely in Arabic. That's been
*29:41.220- 29:46.260* :  getting some of you talking about the way Arabic culture and language is used in your favorite games.
*29:46.500- 29:50.620* :  When you hear Arabic it's usually in call of a beauty with the terrorist. That's what people
*29:50.620- 29:55.720* :  recognize as Arabic but Arabic is a beautiful language. We caught up with the Mir, he's 20 and
*29:55.720- 30:00.620* :  grew up in Baghdad. They got everything right about Baghdad, the culture that we people look.
*30:02.640- 30:08.760* :  You hear the prayer call, the Azan. And what I heard that they reminded you of just being at home
*30:08.760- 30:13.460* :  because my house was as close as the street from a mosque. So just hearing it in a game felt like
*30:13.660- 30:17.760* :  they got it right. That's home. A lot of people won't necessarily know a lot of the history.
*30:18.020- 30:22.220* :  You know that's the thing in the past 20 years you know Baghdad from the wars. That's all
*30:22.220- 30:28.240* :  that people talk about but Baghdad in specific at the Gulf Iraq. So where Babylon was this is the
*30:28.240- 30:33.800* :  Abbasiyah caliphate. It's a hugely important moment in history. This was the golden age,
*30:33.800- 30:39.360* :  all-knowledge books and biggest writers, mathematicians, they all originate from Iraq and Baghdad.
*30:39.440- 30:43.580* :  Is there anything that you think maybe they haven't quite got right? They got it mostly right,
*30:43.580- 30:48.760* :  but they don't have my neighborhood because it wasn't built yet. I looked at their map, I was like,
*30:48.760- 30:50.480* :  oh why is it a desert? Where's my house?
*30:53.720- 30:57.680* :  So Amir's house aside, what's it like getting all those little details right?
*30:58.240- 31:03.580* :  Mohammed was part of the team that made the game. It kind of became like a personal passion project.
*31:04.220- 31:09.780* :  Seeing one's culture depicted accurately in this way is not something that we see often.
*31:10.160- 31:14.100* :  The different expressions that we localized at one point in the beginning,
*31:14.100- 31:17.940* :  one character says to the other, we would make more money selling water to a camel.
*31:18.440- 31:22.180* :  While that makes sense in English, that is not something we say in Arabic. So we used an
*31:22.180- 31:27.320* :  expression that was common back in the day. We would make more money exporting dates to Hajjah.
*31:27.540- 31:32.960* :  People are more open to entertainment and media from other cultures. A couple of decades ago,
*31:32.960- 31:38.060* :  a Korean drama would not be as popular as it is now. And I think that's something positive.
*31:40.500- 31:44.860* :  That was video game developer Mohammed ending their report by Andrew Rogers.
*31:46.180- 31:52.480* :  Now for fashion that will be truly out of this world, the luxury brand Prada is to help design
*31:52.480- 31:59.520* :  the spacesuits for NASA's Return to the Moon in 2025. The Italian fashion house will be working
*31:59.520- 32:05.260* :  alongside another private company called Axium Space. It appears to be a case of not just style,
*32:05.260- 32:07.880* :  but substance as John's and Joseph reports.
*32:15.020- 32:20.060* :  It's more than 50 years since humanity first stepped foot on the moon,
*32:20.060- 32:27.560* :  something last achieved in 1972. NASA hopes the planned return in 2025 will be top to toe,
*32:27.900- 32:34.080* :  a decidedly more fashionable affair. The luxury fashion brand Prada will help design the spacesuits
*32:34.080- 32:39.860* :  for the Artemis 3 mission as it works with the commercial space company Axium. But it's about
*32:39.860- 32:44.980* :  more than looking good, according to Professor Jeffrey Hoffman, who flew five NASA missions
*32:44.980- 32:50.480* :  and carried out four spacewalks. A spacesuit is really like a miniature spacecraft.
*32:50.480- 32:58.520* :  Oh, your life depends on it. Prada has considerable experience with various types of composite
*32:59.120- 33:05.660* :  fabrics and may actually be able to make some real technical contributions to the outer layer of
*33:05.660- 33:11.200* :  the new spacesuit. That experience has been built on both the catwalks of Milan and through Prada's
*33:11.200- 33:16.520* :  involvement in sailing's America's Cup. The design is likely to stick to white as its main color.
*33:17.020- 33:22.060* :  That's best for coping with the heat of the sun. It also has to be resistant to sharp fragments
*33:22.060- 33:27.700* :  of moon dust whilst being flexible enough for astronauts to move freely. NASA is increasingly
*33:27.700- 33:33.620* :  involving private companies in its next generation of space exploration. It says it values their
*33:33.620- 33:40.360* :  creativity and that creativity now extends to one very well-dressed leap for astronaut kind.
*33:41.640- 33:45.540* :  Jonathan Joseph reporting on a new type of high fashion.
*33:48.200- 33:52.580* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*34:22.820- 34:27.400* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*34:27.700- 34:31.160* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets.
*34:31.320- 34:34.600* :  I was overwhelmed like I had never seen anything like this.
*34:34.840- 34:37.480* :  At the height of Abercrombian fit to success.
*34:37.700- 34:40.140* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.
*34:40.140- 34:43.360* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity.
*34:43.700- 34:49.380* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money, sex and power.
*34:50.380- 34:55.060* :  This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
