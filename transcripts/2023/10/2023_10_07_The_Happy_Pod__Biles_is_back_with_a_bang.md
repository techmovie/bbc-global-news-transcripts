*00:49.220- 00:53.520* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 7th of October,
*00:53.520- 01:00.500* :  celebrating Simone, the extraordinary comeback of US gymnast Simone Biles, athlete, mental health
*01:00.500- 01:06.000* :  campaigner and champion. Tackling one of the world's deadliest diseases, an affordable malaria
*01:06.000- 01:12.620* :  vaccine gets WHO approval. In enormous relief, we've had time to think about it. Yeah, no look,
*01:12.620- 01:17.520* :  it was worth pursuing, it was technically very difficult to take a while to eradicate malaria,
*01:17.520- 01:23.180* :  so we're going to need this vaccine for a while. Some advice for would-be scientists from a Nobel
*01:23.180- 01:29.020* :  Prize winner. I had so much fun in the laboratory, performing the experiments and improving
*01:29.020- 01:34.720* :  things and so I have to emphasize them that it is fun, it is a lot of work but it is fun.
*01:35.840- 01:42.580* :  A man inspired by a question from his grandchildren. They asked me, do you read the story to Pop Pop?
*01:44.640- 01:49.920* :  I couldn't. So, he learnt to read and has written a book of his own, we'll meet him.
*01:50.220- 01:52.960* :  Also in the podcast, the science behind this.
*02:04.740- 02:08.400* :  There are comebacks and then there's Simone Biles.
*02:20.980- 02:24.980* :  So composed, so refined, so confident.
*02:26.840- 02:32.820* :  She has all this competition, all this piece of apparatus, double-lay out for the final tumble,
*02:33.180- 02:39.940* :  as high as you like. Well, that proves it, Biles is, but no question about it.
*02:40.220- 02:45.860* :  A standing ovation from the world of gymnastics and do you know what that routine was?
*02:46.460- 02:51.600* :  It was full of smiles. Look at that face there, that to me says it all.
*02:52.300- 02:57.500* :  Absolute smiles of joy. She is back and back with an absolute bang.
*02:59.080- 03:04.640* :  Now you might remember that in 2021 at the delayed Tokyo Olympics, the American gymnast pulled
*03:04.640- 03:09.540* :  out of a number of events. She said she needed some time away to work on her mental health.
*03:09.540- 03:15.060* :  After suffering what gymnasts call the twisties, that's a mental block that throws off spatial
*03:15.060- 03:19.860* :  awareness, causing them to lose control and do extra twists or flips that they hadn't intended.
*03:20.500- 03:23.600* :  In the worst cases, they can find themselves unable to land safely.
*03:24.380- 03:28.800* :  Well, in her time away, there was even speculation that she would retire from the sport for good.
*03:29.360- 03:36.540* :  But such talk was very premature. She has powered back, winning medals, breaking records and thrilling
*03:36.540- 03:42.400* :  audiences. Natalie Perks from BBC Sport spoke to us from Antwerp, where the world championships
*03:42.400- 03:45.680* :  are taking place about Simone's return to the world stage.
*03:47.140- 03:51.180* :  Well, this is the thing, isn't it? How do you come back from a mental block so bad
*03:51.180- 03:57.560* :  that you can't twist in the air anymore? How can you come back here in Antwerp with a huge smile
*03:57.560- 04:05.240* :  on your face and wow the crowds in the way that she's doing it? It's absolutely unfathomable,
*04:05.240- 04:11.380* :  because the thing about Simone is, you know, this is a really tough sport. She makes it look simple.
*04:11.380- 04:16.880* :  She does things that no one else can do. Well, as you say gymnastics is incredibly tough.
*04:16.940- 04:25.760* :  The human body trained as well as it can be can only do so much, and I speak as a woman who can
*04:25.760- 04:34.140* :  barely get off the sofa without going, oof, but Simone Biles actually has five skills named after
*04:34.140- 04:41.060* :  her, which is astonishing, isn't it? Yes, so in gymnastics, if you land a skill that no one else has
*04:41.060- 04:46.360* :  done before in a major world competition, it gets named after you. So to just have one huge
*04:46.360- 04:52.680* :  achievement, she's got five. At the ripe old age of 26, the fifth actually came here in
*04:52.680- 04:57.800* :  qualifying, where she became the first woman in history to land this incredibly dangerous and
*04:57.800- 05:03.560* :  difficult vault. It's now called the Biles too. It has the highest difficulty value in the women's
*05:03.560- 05:09.780* :  vault, so we may never see her kind again. We're going to see women in the future who pull off
*05:09.780- 05:17.480* :  certain skills and perhaps have skills named after them, but to have five, she is the greatest
*05:17.480- 05:23.480* :  to ever do this sport we've ever seen. What she's doing is so dangerous and just incredible. I mean,
*05:23.480- 05:28.260* :  I'm very, very lucky to do my job when I get to see up close the kind of things she can do and
*05:28.260- 05:33.740* :  watching it live is something else. Let me tell you. As you say, she is the ripe old age of 26.
*05:33.960- 05:40.420* :  That's 26 in human years. That's like 97 in gym last years. What is next for her?
*05:41.280- 05:45.380* :  I think look, she's an absolute rock star of gymnastics, but she now transcends her sport. She's
*05:45.380- 05:50.420* :  a really important figure speaking up for both mental health and abuse survivors. She's now the
*05:50.460- 05:56.780* :  oldest American woman to ever win a world championship medal at just 26. But what's next? We've
*05:56.780- 06:00.680* :  got the Paris Olympics next year, and I think for her, that's definitely her aim. You know, she's
*06:00.680- 06:05.560* :  already a four-time Olympic champion given that she starts as the favourite in five of six events.
*06:05.560- 06:10.920* :  You could definitely see her increasing her medal tally, you know, on what would be essentially
*06:10.920- 06:16.880* :  a triumphant chapter in her fairy tale. That was Natalie Perks of BBC Sports. There were two
*06:16.880- 06:21.600* :  big celebrations in the world of vaccines this week. We'll talk about this year's Nobel Prize
*06:21.600- 06:27.120* :  for Medicine in a minute, but first the World Health Organization has recommended a cheap malaria
*06:27.120- 06:33.880* :  vaccine that can be produced on a massive scale. Malaria kills around 600,000 people a year,
*06:34.280- 06:39.760* :  mainly children under five. This vaccine is only the second one to be developed and costs less
*06:39.760- 06:45.180* :  per dose than the first. Professor Sir Adrian Hill, who developed it, told us about the moment
*06:45.180- 06:50.480* :  the WHO Director General made the announcement. In enormous relief, we didn't know what he was
*06:50.480- 06:57.000* :  going to say as we all sat down and watched the whole team in many countries for amazing
*06:57.000- 07:02.520* :  clinical teams in countries in Africa. The manufacturer is in India, the adjuvant providers in
*07:02.800- 07:08.020* :  the United States. Yes, it's been quite an experience putting this together. You have got there.
*07:08.580- 07:14.460* :  It's your life's work. We've had time to think about it. Yeah, no, look, it was worth pursuing. It
*07:14.460- 07:18.580* :  was technically very difficult, but we've learned things that will be applicable to other vaccines,
*07:18.580- 07:25.140* :  comparing technologies. We've compared a lot, and this one really stands out in terms of the
*07:25.640- 07:31.980* :  poster magnitude and the durability of the antibodies that we can generate. With a previous vaccine,
*07:32.820- 07:38.040* :  around about 50% of the malaria cases were being prevented, which is very valuable and impactful,
*07:38.040- 07:46.160* :  but we seem to be closer to the 75% mark reducing cases by three quarters. But some people would argue
*07:46.160- 07:51.580* :  that two other facets are even more important. You've already mentioned the price, which should be
*07:51.580- 07:58.600* :  a few dollars, not eight or ten dollars, a dose, and really importantly, the supply. So we've
*07:58.600- 08:03.600* :  been working with the Serum Institute of India, who were our industrial partner during the COVID
*08:03.600- 08:08.460* :  response. Here, they're looking at a hundred million next year, maybe two hundred million doses
*08:08.460- 08:14.600* :  a year after. And that's the sort of number that you need to prevent a lot of children dying.
*08:15.100- 08:19.260* :  So we'll take a while to eradicate malaria, so we're going to need this vaccine for a while.
*08:20.140- 08:22.180* :  And then there was the Nobel Prize for medicine,
*08:22.180- 08:28.480* :  awarded to a pair of scientists who developed the technology that led to the mRNA COVID vaccines.
*08:28.480- 08:34.480* :  Professors Catalan Carrico and Drew Weissman originally met at the photocopying machine when
*08:34.480- 08:40.620* :  they were young researchers and went on to spend decades working together. Neither quite believed it
*08:40.660- 08:47.280* :  when they received the call. I thought maybe it was just a joke. Of course, later I get more
*08:47.280- 08:52.980* :  information and I started to believe, but I still had to wait for the announcement to make sure
*08:52.980- 09:01.140* :  that it's real. I had the exact same feeling. I was sort of overjoyed in disbelief and a little
*09:01.140- 09:07.760* :  bit suspecting that it was some anti-vaxxer play in a prank on us. I talked to Katie and we had
*09:07.760- 09:14.540* :  the same feeling, but when we saw the announcement, we knew it was real and it was just a fantastic feeling.
*09:15.480- 09:23.940* :  I did a produced RNA and Drew, he did a cultured cells and so kind of shoulder to shoulder we worked
*09:23.940- 09:30.520* :  on this project. I would go to meetings and present what I was working on and people would look at
*09:30.520- 09:35.120* :  me and say, oh, that's very nice. But why don't you do something worthwhile with your time?
*09:35.120- 09:42.380* :  But Katie and I kept pushing. I think we have to start talking to high school kids to get them
*09:42.380- 09:49.740* :  excited about science, to see that it's a rewarding, fulfilling career, that if they're interested
*09:49.740- 09:56.740* :  in solving problems and asking questions, it's a great feel to go into. And that's something that
*09:56.740- 10:02.500* :  Katie and I spend a lot of time working on. Exactly. From outside, it seems like, oh,
*10:02.500- 10:08.900* :  you must be sad, you struggle. I have to say that I had so much fun in the laboratory, performing
*10:08.900- 10:14.340* :  the experiments and improving things. And so I have to emphasize them that it is fun. It is
*10:14.620- 10:22.480* :  lot of work, but it is fun. At the end, if you result, have somebody to have a better life or
*10:22.840- 10:29.320* :  cure some disease, that's even an extraordinary word. You have to have fun and enjoy it.
*10:30.180- 10:35.760* :  Professors Catalan Carrico and Drew Weissman, winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine.
*10:36.560- 10:41.800* :  Now we do like it when listeners email us with their stories and ideas, and this one comes from Hong
*10:41.800- 10:47.080* :  Kong, where medical students have been making use of a novel, generative AI chatbot as part of
*10:47.080- 10:51.540* :  learning clinical bedside skills. And it's going so well that they're getting together with the
*10:51.540- 10:56.720* :  National University of Singapore in hopes of broadening the scope of students from both universities.
*10:57.480- 11:02.740* :  So can a good bedside manner be taught this way? We caught up with Michael Coe of the University
*11:02.740- 11:07.160* :  of Hong Kong Department of Surgery and student to research here to find out.
*11:07.920- 11:12.100* :  The technology is really evolving very quickly. Best architecture has been there for centuries,
*11:12.100- 11:16.740* :  because it's an integral part of the medical education that hasn't changed much over the last
*11:16.740- 11:23.100* :  century or so. But with this kind of chatbot, so students are now able to practice anywhere they
*11:23.100- 11:28.600* :  want. And also for us, the tutors, we can design our own patients. We can design the complex
*11:28.600- 11:33.020* :  patients to challenge our students' thinking and learning and even design their personality.
*11:33.020- 11:38.440* :  So I've decided some patients who are vertokative and some patients might be a bit timid and some
*11:38.440- 11:44.020* :  patients might be a bit aggressive and impolite. So I think it's really a bit of imagination and
*11:44.020- 11:50.960* :  it's very interesting. And Teresa, how is it to use? Have you tried different methods of learning
*11:50.960- 11:55.880* :  which actually involved real people? How is it for you as a student to use this new system?
*11:56.820- 12:03.260* :  I think virtual bedside teaching can be superior in terms of its flexibility and we can easily do it
*12:03.280- 12:09.200* :  at our own convenience. But you can never really replicate, can you, using AI, the relationship
*12:09.220- 12:15.480* :  between a doctor and a patient who is ill, frightened, maybe confused? One of the missing
*12:15.480- 12:20.720* :  elements, I would say, with the direct physical content as well as physical interaction with the
*12:20.720- 12:27.160* :  patients, I would say in-person interactions allow us to observe and interpret some kinds of
*12:27.160- 12:32.360* :  non-ferbal clues from our patients, which is quite essential in our medical training.
*12:33.060- 12:37.680* :  So Michael, this is a really exciting time for medicine, isn't it? All these new tools that
*12:37.680- 12:43.640* :  you're disposal? Yeah, because another big thing is that we are hosting, I think the world's first
*12:43.700- 12:49.580* :  con-joint virtual bedside teaching with another university in Asia, the National University of
*12:49.580- 12:55.560* :  Singapore. So I'm designing my own Hong Kong patient for the Singaporean students and then the
*12:55.560- 13:00.880* :  Singaporean professors are designing their patients for our Hong Kong students to see. So it
*13:00.880- 13:06.200* :  broadens the vision of our students and also this kind of knowledge exchange internationally
*13:06.200- 13:11.480* :  would be a big trend. And I think they, I has revolutionized the whole medical education.
*13:12.120- 13:17.740* :  Michael Co. of the University of Hong Kong Department of Surgery and Student Teresa Tser, thank you both.
*13:18.340- 13:23.160* :  Now, you might remember the words of hope and joy we heard from Sisi Dent in the last edition.
*13:23.600- 13:26.880* :  Daniel Robus in South Africa was moved to get in touch.
*13:27.900- 13:31.980* :  Thanks for an awesome show, living in South Africa, it's always wonderful to hear
*13:31.980- 13:37.820* :  here happy news from around the world. My name's Daniel and I'm in Johannesburg and we're about to
*13:37.820- 13:44.320* :  have a lacquer bri. That's a word from our lexicon which its direct translation means sweet
*13:44.320- 13:49.720* :  but it is so much more and encapsulates everything good in a moment or experience.
*13:49.740- 13:56.460* :  That was a lacquer drink or here's such a lacquer guy or wow the spring box scored a wonderful
*13:56.460- 14:02.780* :  lacquer try. Anyway, I hope you have a lacquer week ahead and thank you for the good news podcast.
*14:03.980- 14:08.180* :  You are most welcome Daniel and a bri for those of you who don't know is like a South African
*14:08.180- 14:15.560* :  barbecue a very social feast cooked over real flame. And Pablo Castanierda tells us he likes
*14:15.560- 14:22.400* :  the Italian word frutti vendola. He says it's simple fruit seller but the word sounds wonderful
*14:22.500- 14:27.620* :  and has all five vowels we like it to Pablo. Thank you both and keep them coming.
*14:32.640- 14:38.120* :  Still to come in this podcast. It was really exciting. It had millions and millions of clicks.
*14:39.440- 14:42.480* :  The town that went viral in its search for a new doctor.
*14:51.460- 14:54.980* :  Kalki presents My Indian Life If the BBC World Service
*14:54.980- 15:01.600* :  podcast exploring the lives of extraordinary people from all over India. People like Savita
*15:01.600- 15:09.320* :  Kanchval, their mountain climber who climbed Mount Everest and Mount Makalu in just 15 days. Her
*15:09.320- 15:16.520* :  life was tragically cut short last year. Listen to her inspiring story now by searching for Kalki
*15:16.520- 15:22.760* :  presents My Indian Life Wherever You Get Your BBC Podcast. Now some of the other things that caught
*15:22.760- 15:27.940* :  our attention this week. The great good fortune of Prateek Kumar who survived after falling
*15:27.940- 15:34.620* :  under a moving train in West Champaran in India. He lay very still indeed between the two tracks.
*15:34.620- 15:38.620* :  There's even video showing horrified officials waiting for the train to pass.
*15:38.620- 15:42.840* :  One of our occasional series that I'm thinking of calling not extinct after all.
*15:43.000- 15:49.380* :  This time it's a small species of holly tree in Brazil known as the Pernambu Kuhholly.
*15:49.420- 15:55.400* :  It hasn't been seen in almost 200 years and finally I urge you to look for the finalists in
*15:55.400- 16:01.860* :  this year's Comedy Wildlife Photo Awards. Bears, birds, kangaroos and even apparently
*16:01.860- 16:07.320* :  a levitating seal. It's in the in-pictures page of our website and I will share the link on
*16:07.320- 16:12.300* :  social media with the hashtag the happy pod. The winner will be announced in November.
*16:12.820- 16:20.260* :  Now two New Zealand to meet Michael Kingipotiki who left school in literate at 14 and who in his
*16:20.260- 16:26.300* :  50s realized he wanted to be able to read to his grandchildren. So he got help from a retired
*16:26.300- 16:32.080* :  teacher, started learning and he's now written his own book, A Journey Towards Literacy,
*16:32.540- 16:36.260* :  proving it's never too late. Michael told us about his inspiration.
*16:37.320- 16:41.920* :  Watch my wife bed into my grandchildren and they asked me,
*16:42.660- 16:51.020* :  if you need a story to pop up and I couldn't. That took me back and I thought to myself
*16:51.020- 16:57.080* :  I got to do something about it. So I reached out and I found the help I needed.
*16:57.920- 17:02.020* :  So just to go back, what was school like for you?
*17:03.080- 17:10.160* :  Oh that was terrible. I was born with a short tongue and nobody could understand me. I started
*17:11.660- 17:18.160* :  and it could say I was putting the back of the class every room I went to. I was watching
*17:18.160- 17:25.400* :  some kids in the classroom reading. I want to do that too. So I've asked this particular teacher,
*17:26.060- 17:32.700* :  could you teach me to read? He said, it's too late, you're too old. So from that moment on,
*17:33.860- 17:39.380* :  I go from my rest of my life at read writing until I found my person who helped you to read.
*17:40.320- 17:43.420* :  And her name is Linda Davis. Tell us about her.
*17:44.980- 17:50.420* :  Well, what can I not say about her? The patience of a teacher I never met before my whole life.
*17:51.520- 17:57.800* :  I wanted somebody who treated me like an adult, not a child. I don't want to start on baby books
*17:58.760- 18:06.580* :  and she was that person I wanted to learn by. And I wish you luck. Boxer roses and she's got
*18:06.580- 18:14.380* :  patience. So much patience with me, it's not funny. How did you get by all of those decades
*18:15.340- 18:22.920* :  when you hadn't yet acquired this skill? The little white lies. I've left my glasses behind.
*18:23.860- 18:29.680* :  Can I take that home and I read a letter? And it worked for a long, long time.
*18:31.080- 18:37.500* :  The biggest thing I wanted to do was display to my grandchildren that their grandfather or
*18:37.500- 18:48.380* :  they call me pop pop. That my life wasn't easy. I've coped and given hope that you can do anything you
*18:48.380- 18:56.700* :  want to by trying a wee bit harder. My granddaughter, she's 12 years old. She read my book for the first
*18:56.700- 19:07.300* :  on last night and she said to my wife, I love pop pop spot. Now I understand. It takes in the
*19:07.300- 19:14.520* :  famous story where I grew up like. Part of when we were kids we had a pig penguin. My father found
*19:14.520- 19:20.500* :  it. He was a fisherman and he found a flat in the middle of the ocean and his name was Percy
*19:20.500- 19:26.840* :  the Penguin. So we used to go swimming in the sea with him and there we had a lot of
*19:27.340- 19:33.440* :  joyful times with that penguin. So Percy the Penguin is the beginning of a whole series of
*19:33.440- 19:38.060* :  children's books I would think. That sounds amazing. We probably let her on in my life and might
*19:38.060- 19:45.100* :  do that. But writing a book, the process, it wasn't easy, was it? It took a long time to get
*19:45.100- 19:54.940* :  page 1 all the way and page 2. Now the book's finished. I'm proud of seeing the words I've written
*19:54.940- 20:02.960* :  down come to life and if it can help somebody out there who can't read and write at my age,
*20:03.240- 20:08.780* :  if I can do it, they can do it. And before you start that journey, good look at yourself
*20:08.780- 20:16.320* :  because your pride takes over your first step. Once you get out of that, tell somebody I need help
*20:17.280- 20:23.900* :  you're in your way. Michael Kingipotuki, the author. Now it's not always easy to find the best
*20:23.900- 20:29.120* :  person for the job and sometimes you need to do something more eye catching than just a regular ad.
*20:29.120- 20:33.980* :  When the town of Los Whirlil in Cornwall in the southwest of England needed a doctor,
*20:34.620- 20:40.480* :  they went the viral social media video route. The video's creator was Emma Mansfield. Let's hear a
*20:40.480- 20:49.980* :  bit of it. We want you doctors for our town to keep us playing at blowing brass or singing in our
*20:49.980- 20:59.120* :  choir. We need your time. Our videos are kind of joyous celebration of our community in a musical
*20:59.120- 21:05.580* :  plea for a doctor to come and work in our town of Los Whirlil and serve our many communities
*21:05.580- 21:10.780* :  from children right the way up to older members of the community. Good to see all the different
*21:10.780- 21:16.460* :  groups that live here participated. We had children the eight months old right the way up to some of
*21:16.460- 21:24.100* :  our singers and musicians who are in their late 70s and early 80s. Yes, this video involves children,
*21:24.100- 21:31.380* :  the fish and chip shop, pharmacist, fire fighters, there's a yoga class. Was it difficult
*21:31.380- 21:37.700* :  to persuade them to participate and then to knock them into shape and get them to do all the moves?
*21:38.660- 21:43.400* :  So it was a bit like sort of going around the town and just picking up little shots and obviously
*21:43.400- 21:48.520* :  we contacted everybody and said that would you be up for it. One of my favourites was the butters.
*21:48.720- 21:53.540* :  I mean that was hilarious because they have absolutely no rhythm whatsoever which they
*21:53.540- 21:57.900* :  just had to keep repeating and then they just made it their own which was great. So I think people
*21:57.900- 22:04.280* :  enjoyed the novelty of it. Now most people if they were looking for someone to fill a job would
*22:04.280- 22:09.400* :  write a job ad and if you were writing a job ad for a doctor you'd probably put it in sensible
*22:09.400- 22:15.640* :  medical journals. What was wrong with that approach? Our advert would have been lost in a sea of
*22:15.640- 22:22.400* :  you know advertisements from other surgeries all over the UK but when Dr Hendrix approached us he
*22:22.400- 22:26.580* :  said you know we need to do something different. We need to do a call for something and a pop video
*22:26.980- 22:31.260* :  is great way to do it because we knew it could have got on to TikTok and perfect for social media
*22:31.260- 22:36.820* :  and quite quick for us to get together and it was really exciting. It had millions and millions of
*22:36.960- 22:40.520* :  clicks and then the next day it was in the paper and you couldn't buy any newspapers in the local
*22:40.520- 22:45.700* :  paper shop. People were getting up extra early to get their copy. We had some really great coverage.
*22:46.480- 22:52.040* :  Now we did actually try to get hold of the doctor who answered the call. She was busy actually
*22:52.040- 22:57.000* :  looking after sick people astonishingly. So between us how's she settling in?
*22:57.580- 23:02.000* :  Oh do you know I actually saw her the other day and I think she's really enjoying it. She's now
*23:02.000- 23:08.020* :  much near her family and she is raising her family here and she's really young and positive
*23:08.020- 23:15.360* :  so actually it was a perfect fit. Emma Mansfield in Cornwall. There are few things that we like more
*23:15.700- 23:21.600* :  than a happy human here on the happy pod but one thing that does spring to mind a happy cat bear
*23:21.600- 23:26.640* :  with me. Cats of course are thought to express their happiness via these sorts of sounds.
*23:35.260- 23:40.800* :  A cat's per is one of the more distinctive sounds it makes and it can even be felt as a vibration
*23:41.540- 23:46.700* :  but as common and delightful as purring is scientists have long been confused about how it's
*23:46.700- 23:54.180* :  possible to make that sound until now. Stephanie Prentice has this report. I'm at a cat cafe in
*23:54.180- 23:59.800* :  central London. It's a space where cats and shelters come to live and they get a chance to meet
*23:59.800- 24:07.100* :  a potential new owner. The girl up on my lap is Gerdy. He lives here in this space. It's like a
*24:07.100- 24:13.520* :  normal cafe but full of cat toys, platforms, water fountains and scratch poles as well as plenty
*24:13.520- 24:18.140* :  of cat lovers. Yep, you could take this plenty here to purr about.
*24:21.060- 24:26.760* :  Purring is a sound we often associate with comfort, contentment and a human feel-in bond.
*24:28.020- 24:33.060* :  How's it been purring? We're trying to get the purr. Oh, it makes me feel so happy. I feel so loved.
*24:33.120- 24:39.440* :  I'm like oh my god, you love me. They're so cute and I just feel like so warm inside.
*24:39.960- 24:46.040* :  But as simple as a purr may seem to cat lovers, for scientists it's proved much more puzzling.
*24:46.040- 24:51.700* :  What they call their classic meow, as well as noises like yowling and muring, all make sense
*24:51.700- 24:57.620* :  from a biological perspective, but the purr, that's a little different. Christian Herbst from
*24:57.620- 25:03.340* :  the University of Vienna took the mystery on as part of dedicated research into purring.
*25:03.620- 25:10.760* :  A cat, when it purrs, it purrs at a frequency of 30 Hz, so that's 30 times a second.
*25:10.760- 25:17.020* :  You would expect that from an animal that has the size of a little bit less than an elephant,
*25:17.020- 25:24.280* :  so it's really, really low frequency sound. So normally large animals create low sounds and small
*25:24.280- 25:30.660* :  animals create high-pitched sounds, meaning while the cat is small, its vocal ability is mighty.
*25:31.260- 25:36.240* :  What we found basically came as a surprise because it sheds a completely new light
*25:36.240- 25:41.700* :  on the sound production mechanism of cats. Christians findings build on prior understanding
*25:41.700- 25:47.940* :  that cats contract and relax their laryngeal structure to purr, opening and closing their vocal folds.
*25:47.940- 25:53.760* :  The findings suggest that actually a special pad in the vocal box allows that to happen.
*25:54.220- 26:00.100* :  What we found if we looked a little bit closer is a special anatomical structure
*26:00.100- 26:07.840* :  in the vocal fold of the cat, and this structure allows the frequency to be so low.
*26:08.680- 26:14.900* :  What Christian couldn't tell us is exactly why cats purr. I have to draw a blank.
*26:15.340- 26:20.920* :  But back in the cafe, visitors had some ideas. What do you think it is that makes cats purr?
*26:21.520- 26:26.860* :  Just think when they're happy, they're just a nice little response so they feel safe, isn't it?
*26:28.100- 26:32.540* :  Oh yeah, you like the pets. Well, I think if it's my cat, I just feel really special.
*26:32.840- 26:36.540* :  I'm like, aren't you comfortable with me? I love it.
*26:41.480- 26:46.200* :  That report by Stephanie Prentice, our resident cat lady, and there is some competition for that.
*26:46.640- 26:50.680* :  And our thanks to the staff at Java Whiskers Cat Cafe for having us,
*26:51.040- 26:54.220* :  and its residents are available for adoption to good homes.
*26:57.400- 26:58.540* :  And that's it from us for now.
*26:58.540- 27:02.320* :  Remember, if you would like to be part of the happy pod, just email us.
*27:02.680- 27:07.360* :  Sounds that bring you joy, delicious words from your country or region for good things,
*27:07.640- 27:08.420* :  you get the idea.
*27:08.660- 27:12.380* :  As ever, the address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*27:12.380- 27:15.680* :  This edition was mixed by Shalota Toshimska.
*27:15.960- 27:19.000* :  The producer was Anna Murphy. Our editor is Karen Martin.
*27:19.260- 27:21.760* :  I'm Jackie Leonard, and until next time, goodbye.
