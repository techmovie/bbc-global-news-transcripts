*00:52.360- 00:55.800* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:58.000- 01:03.580* :  I'm Jackie Lennon at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 18th of October. These are our main stories.
*01:04.240- 01:08.780* :  President Biden is visiting Israel in a show of support during its continued war against
*01:08.780- 01:16.180* :  Hamas in Gaza. You're not alone. You are not alone. As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to
*01:16.180- 01:23.080* :  have Israel's back as you work to defend your people. His visit comes less than a day after a huge
*01:23.080- 01:29.000* :  explosion at a gas and hospital. Hamas blames and Israeli air strike. Israel blames a misfire by
*01:29.000- 01:36.480* :  Palestinian militants. Also in this podcast, new evidence of devastating ethnic violence in
*01:36.480- 01:43.460* :  Western Sudan. What we're seeing is a pattern of villages being burned. That scale is enormous.
*01:44.200- 01:49.140* :  And President Xi Jinping celebrates the achievements of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
*01:52.800- 01:58.500* :  The support from the US for Israel couldn't be clearer. Not only has President Biden expressed
*01:58.500- 02:04.540* :  his backing by turning up in Israel, he's also said that from what he's seen, he thinks Tuesday's
*02:04.540- 02:11.240* :  explosion at a hospital in Gaza was not Israel's fault. It was in his words that of the other team.
*02:12.040- 02:16.860* :  He had been expecting to see Arab leaders on this trip to the region too, but in the aftermath
*02:16.860- 02:22.640* :  of the hospital explosion, that was called off. The incident has only stoked the ever rising tensions.
*02:22.640- 02:28.400* :  Speaking jointly at a news conference, here's what Benjamin Netanyahu and Mr. Biden had to say.
*02:29.200- 02:33.540* :  Mr. President, you're meeting with our United War Cabinet,
*02:35.360- 02:41.360* :  United and resolved to lead Israel to victory. This will be a different kind of war
*02:42.660- 02:48.480* :  because Hamas is a different kind of enemy. While Israel seeks to minimize civilian casualties,
*02:49.320- 02:55.620* :  Hamas seeks to maximize civilian casualties. Hamas wants to kill as many Israelis as possible
*02:56.480- 03:03.360* :  and has no regard whatsoever to Palestinian lives. Every day, they perpetrate a double
*03:03.360- 03:09.660* :  war crime, targeting our civilians while hiding behind their civilians, embedding themselves
*03:09.740- 03:18.520* :  in the civilian population and using them as human shields. We've seen the cost of this terrible
*03:18.520- 03:25.700* :  double war crime against humanity. The Hamas is perpetrating in the last 11 days. As Israel
*03:25.700- 03:33.520* :  legitimately targets terrorists, civilians are unfortunately harmed. Hamas is responsible and
*03:33.520- 03:39.520* :  should be held accountable for all civilian casualties. We saw the cost of this terrible war crime
*03:39.520- 03:45.600* :  yesterday when Iraq had fired by a Palestinian terrorist and is fired and landed on a Palestinian
*03:45.600- 03:51.860* :  hospital. The entire world was rightfully outraged, but this outraged should be directed not in
*03:51.860- 03:58.460* :  Israel, but at the terrorists. As we proceed in this war, Israel will do everything it can
*03:59.240- 04:04.920* :  to keep civilians out of harm's way. We have asked them and will continue to ask them to move
*04:04.920- 04:12.180* :  to safer areas. We'll continue to work with you, Mr. President, to assure that the minimal
*04:12.180- 04:18.060* :  requirements are met and will continue to work together to get our hostages out.
*04:19.860- 04:26.120* :  Mr. President, the road to victory will be long and hard, but united in purpose and with a deep
*04:26.120- 04:33.520* :  sense of justice and the unbreakable spirit of our soldiers and our people, Israel will prevail.
*04:34.440- 04:35.300* :  Thank you, Mr. President.
*04:35.920- 04:46.420* :  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. In the wake of Hamas is a pauling. Terrorists are all brutal in
*04:46.420- 04:55.980* :  you main, almost beyond belief what they did. This cabinet came together and standing strong,
*04:56.720- 05:04.380* :  standing united, and I want you to know you're not alone. You are not alone. As I emphasized
*05:04.380- 05:12.540* :  earlier, we will continue to have Israel's back as you work to defend your people. We'll
*05:12.540- 05:18.300* :  continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy in this
*05:18.300- 05:26.960* :  civilians. 75 years ago, your founders declared that this nation would be one based on freedom,
*05:27.860- 05:34.800* :  justice and peace, based on freedom, justice and peace. The United States stands with you
*05:35.520- 05:41.880* :  in defense of that freedom. It pursued that justice and the support of that peace.
*05:42.900- 05:50.000* :  Today, tomorrow and always, we promise you. That was President Biden. We also heard from Benjamin Netanyahu.
*05:50.740- 05:55.200* :  Our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell, is in Jerusalem and was watching that joint appearance.
*05:55.900- 06:00.080* :  First, we learned that the U.S., which of course will have its own intelligence and resources to,
*06:00.080- 06:05.460* :  is convinced by Israel's explanation of what happened at Al-Ahli Hospital overnight in Gaza.
*06:05.500- 06:12.640* :  Basically, blaming Islamic Jihad rockets for misfiring with Mr Biden telling Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:12.640- 06:17.700* :  it appears it was done by the other team. He talked about how he was deeply saddened and outraged
*06:17.700- 06:21.960* :  by that incident. But he did acknowledge there's a lot of people out there who are not so sure.
*06:22.360- 06:26.880* :  We've got to overcome a lot of things. Of course, Hamas and Palestinian authorities in general
*06:26.880- 06:31.880* :  of blaming the deaths that the hospital on an Israeli air strike. Mr Biden also spoke about the
*06:31.880- 06:37.740* :  need to free the hostages in the Gaza Strip that were taken by Hamas, including children. And he
*06:37.740- 06:42.400* :  talked about those attacks just saying, imagine what those children hiding from Hamas were thinking
*06:42.400- 06:48.060* :  it's beyond my comprehension. What do you think each leader wants to get out of this visit?
*06:48.560- 06:53.720* :  For Mr Netanyahu, you saw there was a hug at the airport. This was a rare act. A presidential
*06:53.720- 06:59.260* :  visit to a war zone. He thanked Mr Biden for what he called his moral clarity. He said,
*06:59.260- 07:04.140* :  you've rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism.
*07:04.560- 07:10.200* :  And referred to a tweet by Mr Biden, and she on X, where he talked about Hamas' actions as
*07:10.200- 07:15.000* :  sheer evil. For Mr Biden, this was much more difficult. I mean, it was meant to be a visit,
*07:15.220- 07:20.040* :  like to show, of course, wartime solidarity after the horrors of that Hamas attack on the 7th of
*07:20.040- 07:25.240* :  October. And I think, of course, he did that. But no announcements really on the other important
*07:25.240- 07:29.100* :  diplomatic issues where we were looking for progress. And that all became much more problematic.
*07:29.760- 07:34.440* :  Once you can only see the Israeli leader and victims of recent events on the Israeli side,
*07:34.440- 07:40.260* :  but not meet the Arab leaders, the allies of the US as he originally planned. And we haven't had
*07:40.260- 07:44.560* :  announcements then on any efforts to persuade Israel to open up a kind of humanitarian corridor
*07:44.560- 07:49.860* :  to Gaza to create safe areas there for civilians. He could make advances on that so that he
*07:49.860- 07:55.680* :  could have better talks with the US's Arab allies, use them as mediators, perhaps on the hostage
*07:55.680- 08:00.500* :  issue. So we've now got a much more complicated picture around the region where tensions are really
*08:00.500- 08:07.140* :  inflamed. As you say, he wasn't able to go and have this meeting with regional Arab leaders.
*08:07.540- 08:13.300* :  But who else might he be able to speak to on this trip or around this trip?
*08:14.020- 08:18.320* :  Although he's not, you know, going to Jordan as planned, I mean, he has specified that on the way
*08:18.320- 08:24.040* :  home. He will be speaking to the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian
*08:24.040- 08:29.160* :  Authority. He's of course a political rival of Hamas. Also to President Abdul Fassad,
*08:29.160- 08:34.760* :  CC of Egypt, Egypt has an important role here. It neighbours both Gaza and Israel has the
*08:34.760- 08:38.480* :  Rafa crossing owned the only crossing into Gaza not controlled by Israel. And you've got
*08:38.480- 08:42.460* :  these hundreds of lorries of aid waiting in Egypt's Sinai to try to go into Gaza.
*08:43.040- 08:48.140* :  You land now. And as she said, both sides are continuing to blame each other for the destruction
*08:48.140- 08:54.820* :  at the Atli Hospital in Gaza City. Investigations are continuing. But what we do know is that hundreds
*08:54.820- 09:00.260* :  of people have been reported dead after the blast on Tuesday evening. Many more were injured.
*09:00.780- 09:04.300* :  The BBC's Rushdie Abu Alouf visited the site on Wednesday morning.
*09:13.560- 09:19.520* :  People are still trying to understand what's happened. I was talking to the one of the people who
*09:19.520- 09:25.580* :  witnessed this, what the Palestinian Authority must have done. He said that they were just sitting
*09:25.580- 09:33.780* :  in the garden peacefully and suddenly, a huge explosion broke this area. And he said, we started
*09:33.780- 09:39.520* :  to collect people from all around Gaza City who could arrive to the hospital. They came and they
*09:39.520- 09:47.140* :  tried to help. He said, we're collecting bodies, injured people, evacuated serious injuries,
*09:47.140- 09:55.220* :  using a motorcycle, some people like evacuated comfort, he said, from here to Shifar.
*09:56.220- 10:01.780* :  The BBC's Rushdie Abu Alouf were protests are being staged around the Middle East in response
*10:01.780- 10:06.480* :  to the blast at the hospital. Thousands have been holding a rally outside the Israeli embassy
*10:06.480- 10:12.200* :  in the Jordanian capital Amman, while a big protest is taking place outside the French Embassy
*10:12.200- 10:17.480* :  in Tunis with people condemning Western countries for supporting Israel. There are similar scenes
*10:17.480- 10:23.700* :  in Turkey and in Iraq, where the US military says it's intercepted two drones targeting its forces.
*10:24.440- 10:28.640* :  The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner told us about the potential security
*10:28.640- 10:33.080* :  challenges the region's facing. Well, they're very serious. Remember that the US has been trying to
*10:33.080- 10:38.460* :  disengage itself in this region for some time. It no longer depends on oil from the Middle East
*10:38.460- 10:44.240* :  and the way it used to. It has pretty much given up trying to knock heads together in terms of the
*10:44.920- 10:50.620* :  long-morry-bund Palestinian-Israeli peace process. So this was an unplanned visit that's,
*10:50.620- 10:55.660* :  or rather hastily planned, that was never intended to be. The security challenge, I think, is
*10:55.660- 11:00.600* :  trying to stop it escalating, trying to reduce tensions. Last night's explosion
*11:01.080- 11:08.400* :  at the Al-Ahli hospital, whoever was behind it, has raised tensions even further. There's no
*11:08.400- 11:13.300* :  question that the region around Israel. All things Israel was responsible, which it denies. It says
*11:13.300- 11:18.120* :  it was Palestinian, Islam, it she had. The big question is, where does Iran stand on all of this?
*11:18.120- 11:25.180* :  Because Iran sees an opportunity to humble and humiliate and hurt Israel via its proxies. It
*11:25.180- 11:30.000* :  doesn't want to get into an actual shooting war with Israel because that will be hugely damaging.
*11:30.620- 11:35.360* :  But it has got its proxies, the biggest one of which is Hezbollah, which has got around
*11:35.360- 11:41.020* :  150,000 rockets, many of which are long-range, precision-guided. They could take out specific
*11:41.020- 11:46.700* :  buildings in Tel Aviv. They could flatten whole ministries if they wanted. The retribution would
*11:46.700- 11:53.540* :  be huge, but it is a possibility. Israel fought a war with Hezbollah in 2006 and neither side
*11:53.540- 11:57.620* :  really won. So there have been some quite threatening statements coming out of Iran saying,
*11:57.620- 12:02.720* :  we can't stand idly by what Gaza gets pummeled. I think President Biden will want to get
*12:02.720- 12:08.700* :  the Israelis to show a bit more restraint in the punishment of Hamas because it's killing
*12:08.700- 12:14.240* :  70 civilians. Now, obviously, his visit has been somewhat curtailed. He was hoping to see
*12:14.240- 12:21.280* :  Arab leaders that has now been cancelled. Does his visit to Israel still have the potential
*12:21.280- 12:27.320* :  to reduce tensions in the end? Well, it does, I think, if you can show that there is some kind
*12:27.320- 12:32.720* :  of humanitarian benefit out of this, if you can get, for example, if the Israelis to open
*12:32.720- 12:38.340* :  the border to let in humanitarian supplies. Remember, there is a huge great big convoy
*12:38.340- 12:43.400* :  of articulated trucks sitting at Ruffa on the Egyptian side of the border waiting to deliver
*12:43.400- 12:51.400* :  desperately needed supplies to the civilian population in Gaza. And so far, the Israeli attitude
*12:51.400- 12:56.280* :  has been, you know, while you've got our hostages, we're not going to open the borders.
*12:56.720- 13:00.220* :  You're stuck there until you release our hostages and there seems to be a kind of
*13:00.220- 13:05.100* :  unpass. Hamas don't want to do that. They don't want to release them. And Israel doesn't want to
*13:05.100- 13:10.360* :  open the border. The same time you've got a number of dual nationals and foreign nationals who
*13:10.360- 13:16.000* :  are desperately trying to get out of Gaza, Egypt doesn't want to open the border that way
*13:16.000- 13:21.420* :  to let them out. It's very wary of having a kind of tentative city springing up in the north
*13:21.420- 13:27.840* :  of the Sinai, which may end up being a permanent refugee camp in the way that the 1948 refugee crisis
*13:27.840- 13:33.800* :  became exactly that. That was Frank Gardner. And as he said, even those with foreign passports
*13:33.800- 13:38.820* :  currently have no way to leave Gaza. That's left families around the world living in fear for
*13:38.820- 13:45.280* :  their loved ones. Ahmed Abu Foul, a doctor in the UK, spoke to my colleague, Michelle Hussain,
*13:45.280- 13:50.680* :  alongside his brother, Muhammad, who's in southern Gaza. We are on a family off 16. We all
*13:50.680- 13:56.420* :  have rich citizens. We have been trapped here in Gaza Strip. There is no such a place here in Gaza.
*13:57.060- 14:04.640* :  We listened to the instructions as we told to move south of Gaza. So we moved there and where we
*14:04.640- 14:10.060* :  have been, there was bombing, we had to move again and again and again. And thought that we
*14:10.060- 14:15.260* :  moved five times. We have 80 children, the oldest is six, the youngest is four months old.
*14:15.540- 14:21.040* :  We are all scared. We don't have a clean water. We don't have electricity. We barely can find
*14:21.040- 14:27.780* :  somewhere to go to the toilet to find the clean water to drink, to make a baby, a little of milk.
*14:27.780- 14:34.480* :  This is in human actually. We can't do this. Where are you now, your family, the 16 of you?
*14:34.480- 14:41.680* :  In Gaza, yeah. We are in Gaza. A friend of us, he managed to find us at room four by four meters
*14:41.740- 14:48.840* :  just to sit there. It's called here. We had to look at each other to warm each other.
*14:49.080- 14:52.840* :  Ahmad, this is your younger brother. What is it like for you knowing that you're
*14:52.840- 14:58.980* :  family are in that position? It's horrible. It's unbearable. Because I feel absolutely helpless.
*15:00.120- 15:05.560* :  You know, there's nothing that we can do here to help and get our family back home to safety.
*15:06.000- 15:10.300* :  Mohammad, are you hoping that if that border opens to foreign passport holders,
*15:10.600- 15:16.000* :  you at least will be able to leave Gaza? I don't think this is possible. We've been at the
*15:16.000- 15:20.860* :  Rafaq crossing border two times in the last five days. There is hundreds of people there.
*15:20.860- 15:26.120* :  Maybe thousands. There is no system. There is no structural way. We can get out of Gaza.
*15:26.760- 15:31.840* :  What would be the most is the babies. You know, I'm not scared for my life. I'll get for my baby's life.
*15:32.460- 15:38.820* :  This morning at the three AM, while the kids were sleeping, my daughter, she was three years old,
*15:38.820- 15:44.600* :  she went out screaming and she was very scared. I think she's a traumatized.
*15:44.900- 15:51.800* :  We don't have hope. This is something really hard to describe. You don't see it.
*15:52.340- 15:56.700* :  Ahmad, what's the, how much of your day is spent trying to work out if your family is still safe?
*15:57.340- 16:03.520* :  Or still alive? Day is like a night for me. We hardly managed to get any sleep because it's
*16:03.520- 16:10.300* :  very dynamic and it's changing by the hour. I find myself that I have to stay awake. That's
*16:10.300- 16:16.800* :  something that cannot control. I'm glued to the TV, to news outlets, to phone and all of that.
*16:16.840- 16:22.580* :  It's very hard. I myself have my own family and I found that I'm struggling the last few days
*16:22.580- 16:27.780* :  to go to work. It's very hard because we lose connection. We lost connection with
*16:27.780- 16:34.140* :  Mohammed and the rest of my family for 24 hours a couple of days ago and that was the most
*16:34.800- 16:39.860* :  scary thing. It's something that I can't even describe. I have a message for the international
*16:39.860- 16:45.460* :  community. It's a little bit, it's a way. We need to get out of here as soon as possible.
*16:46.060- 16:47.360* :  This account is a very difficult time.
*16:48.360- 16:54.320* :  Mohammed and Ahmad Abu Foul talking to Michelle Hussain. Now you might have heard the special
*16:54.320- 16:58.780* :  edition that we recorded answering listeners questions on events in Israel and Gaza.
*16:59.320- 17:03.840* :  The response was such that we're going to do another one. So do please send us your questions
*17:03.840- 17:09.380* :  and our correspondence. We'll try to provide context and clarity. You know what to do? Please

*17:59.620- 18:05.040* :  To other news now, the bbc has seen new evidence of the devastating ethnic violence
*18:05.040- 18:11.240* :  gripping western Sudan. Information from satellite images and social media shows that at least
*18:11.240- 18:17.580* :  68 villages in Darfur have been burned since fighting broke out in April. For the first time,
*18:17.580- 18:22.340* :  a British government minister has described what's happening there as having all the hallmarks
*18:22.340- 18:27.860* :  of ethnic cleansing. Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale has been finding out more.
*18:31.160- 18:34.900* :  A mob rampages through Al-Janana, the capital of West Darfur.
*18:36.360- 18:39.740* :  Arab militias attacking members of the local Masalite tribe.
*18:40.760- 18:43.320* :  And they're using their favorite weapon. Five.
*18:46.320- 18:52.800* :  In the streets, burning vehicles spew thick black fumes. Plumes of smoke rise from building set
*18:52.800- 18:58.740* :  ablaze. So what we have here is a map of essentially burned villages within Sudan. In a small
*18:58.740- 19:03.500* :  office in London, a group of government-funded researchers are recording the ethnic violence
*19:03.500- 19:09.440* :  gripping western Sudan. The center for information resilience uses satellite data and social media
*19:09.440- 19:15.020* :  to track the villages going up in flames. Its director of investigations Ben Strick told me
*19:15.080- 19:20.640* :  at least 68 villages had been targeted with fire since April. What we're seeing is a pattern
*19:20.640- 19:27.200* :  of villages being burnt. One after the other, after the other, specifically in Darfur alone,
*19:27.200- 19:31.160* :  which is where we're seeing some of the heaviest violence outside of Khartoum.
*19:31.580- 19:37.160* :  Some of them whole villages that have been wiped out. That scale is enormous when we think
*19:37.160- 19:43.840* :  upon the impact of civilians. In August, they logged one militia convoy burning no fewer than
*19:43.840- 19:50.760* :  nine villages in one day alone. Sometimes this is infighting between Arab tribes. Sometimes it is
*19:50.760- 19:57.760* :  Arab against non-Arab like the Masalite. Either way, the UK Africa Minister Andrew Mitchell is clear
*19:57.760- 20:04.120* :  what it amounts to. Innocent people are being attacked by militias, particularly by the RSF.
*20:04.520- 20:09.860* :  They are being hounded from their homes and murdered. Women are being raped and attacked
*20:10.500- 20:15.720* :  and houses and are being burnt, crops and cattle destroyed. This is all has all the hallmarks
*20:15.720- 20:21.920* :  of ethnic cleansing. Amin Yakubu fled Darfur last month for a refugee camp in Chad,
*20:22.460- 20:27.040* :  running into the bush with his neighbours to escape the violence, stepping over bodies in the process.
*20:27.460- 20:34.740* :  Whenever attacks happen, everyone is a victim. No one sleeps at night. Everyone has to lie flat on
*20:34.740- 20:40.980* :  the floor due to the incessant gun battles. The aim of the research is to gather evidence
*20:40.980- 20:46.580* :  that could one day bring to justice those responsible, many of whom are members of the RSF.
*20:46.940- 20:51.420* :  Their opponents, the leader of Sudan's armed forces, General Albert Han, told me recently
*20:51.420- 20:58.880* :  he'd cooperate with international prosecutors. We will help anybody that helps us or
*20:58.880- 21:04.080* :  stands with us to capture these criminals and present them to justice. Even with the international
*21:04.080- 21:08.740* :  criminal court, we can cooperate with it to present these perpetrators of crime.
*21:12.460- 21:17.500* :  For now, the violence and the killings go on. Arab militias riding from village to village
*21:17.500- 21:21.400* :  on their motorbikes, leaving death and ash in their way.
*21:24.860- 21:30.400* :  James Landel reporting. A shopkeeper from London has been sentenced to 11 years in prison
*21:30.820- 21:35.920* :  for heading a major human trafficking ring. Heua Rahimpur was one of 21 people
*21:35.920- 21:42.280* :  facing trial in Belgium as part of a Europe-wide investigation. Sophia Bettitzer reports from Brussels.
*21:42.740- 21:49.440* :  Heua Rahimpur arrived in Britain in 2016 and claimed asylum as an Iranian-curd fleeing
*21:49.440- 21:55.880* :  persecution. He was given leave to remain and set up a barbershop in Camden. But from the UK,
*21:55.880- 22:02.320* :  he organised the logistics of a far-reaching criminal operation, procuring boats from Turkey
*22:02.320- 22:08.200* :  and China and transporting them to Europe. Their boats were handed to groups of migrants waiting
*22:08.200- 22:14.820* :  near the sea in Calais and Dunkirk. The migrants were given basic information about how to use them
*22:14.820- 22:21.280* :  to get to Britain. Sophia Bettitzer in Brussels. President Vladimir Putin doesn't do much
*22:21.280- 22:27.200* :  international travel since his troops invaded Ukraine last year, but he is guest of honour in Beijing
*22:27.200- 22:32.900* :  for a summit celebrating 10 years of the Chinese Belt and Road initiative. His host,
*22:32.900- 22:39.620* :  President Xi, said China would not engage in what he called geopolitical games. He outlined
*22:39.620- 22:49.620* :  what he believed the project had achieved. Over these 10 years, we have endeavored to build
*22:49.660- 22:56.340* :  a global network of connectivity consisting of economic corridors, international transportation
*22:56.520- 23:04.760* :  routes and information highway, as well as railways, roads, airports, ports, pipelines and
*23:04.760- 23:11.160* :  power grids, covering the land, the ocean, the sky and the internet. Our Beijing correspondent
*23:11.160- 23:15.560* :  Stephen McDonald is at that summit and he began by explaining the Belt and Road initiative.
*23:16.620- 23:22.240* :  Basically, it's a vision to have transport infrastructure better connecting
*23:23.000- 23:30.400* :  China with Europe via Central Asia and also incorporating Africa. So it's all this money
*23:30.400- 23:40.000* :  in the form of loans and other encouragement and whatnot to build what sea links, rail links,
*23:41.200- 23:48.360* :  bridges, roads and the like. And he says that we're now at the stage of these having gone from
*23:48.360- 23:55.440* :  blueprints to real projects to boost the world's flow of goods. Well, you are at this huge summit
*23:55.440- 24:02.680* :  to celebrate its achievements and to look forward to its future. President Xi told the conference
*24:02.680- 24:09.040* :  that China rejects economic coercion and decoupling. What did he mean? Well, he means a couple of
*24:09.040- 24:16.380* :  things there. When he's speaking about rejecting decoupling and delinking, I think he said
*24:16.380- 24:22.220* :  delinking as well. He's talking a lot there about the US and Europe and this idea that,
*24:22.620- 24:27.480* :  well, that's now been floating around some Western countries, that Western democracies need to
*24:28.060- 24:34.440* :  distance themselves slightly from China because of the dangers inherent of cooperating with China,
*24:34.440- 24:43.980* :  because of, I don't know, spying via computer hacking or because China has been stealing
*24:44.220- 24:50.220* :  the intellectual property of Western companies. So that's what he's talking about there. But
*24:50.220- 24:56.820* :  interestingly, what he also said in the same breath is that China opposes unilateral sanctions
*24:57.560- 25:03.100* :  and economic coercion. Now what that's a message to is Vladimir Putin, who's sitting there in the
*25:03.100- 25:08.260* :  audience, along with all these other world leaders, applauding, it would have been music to Vladimir
*25:08.300- 25:13.760* :  Putin's ears that China opposes unilateral sanctions. And that's because the Russian leader,
*25:14.240- 25:19.300* :  who doesn't get around the world very much now because he has, you know, this warrant out for his
*25:19.300- 25:25.180* :  arrest due to alleged war crimes in Ukraine and so that plenty of places he can't go. And so you can
*25:25.180- 25:30.540* :  rest assured he's made the most of the trip to this forum, lining up the world leaders. He's been
*25:30.540- 25:36.720* :  meeting at least nine of them by my last count, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Hungary's Viktor
*25:36.720- 25:43.440* :  Orban and of course Xi Jinping. And why wouldn't he make the best use of this because he doesn't have
*25:43.440- 25:49.160* :  many opportunities to sit down with these people. Stephen McDonald in Beijing. The US is stepping
*25:49.160- 25:55.060* :  up its efforts to stop artificial intelligence technology reaching China. The latest ban on some
*25:55.060- 26:01.760* :  microchips is designed to prevent the Chinese military importing advanced semiconductors or equipment.
*26:01.760- 26:06.600* :  Our business reporter, Sir and Jonathan Wari, is in Singapore and told us more.
*26:07.300- 26:13.460* :  The Biden administration has announced plans to halt shipments to China of more advanced
*26:13.980- 26:20.660* :  artificial intelligence chips. Now that's affected a number of companies, including some well-known
*26:20.660- 26:28.400* :  names like Nvidia, AMD and Intel with Nvidia seeing an almost 4% drop in shares as a result of
*26:28.400- 26:35.920* :  the announcement. Now Nvidia says the new restrictions will block sales of two high-end artificial
*26:35.920- 26:41.740* :  intelligence chips that it creates just for China and that one of its top-of-the-line gaming chips
*26:41.740- 26:47.420* :  will also be blocked. Now this isn't the first time that these kinds of measures have been introduced.
*26:47.420- 26:52.920* :  Last October, the US introduced wide-reaching measures to block this type of technology from
*26:52.920- 26:58.960* :  reaching China and so what happened was many companies adjusted their workflows and supply chains
*26:58.960- 27:03.700* :  to comply with the restrictions. You can imagine this is not good for business,
*27:04.240- 27:09.660* :  these companies say it will impact their customers and it will also affect the entire chip ecosystem
*27:09.660- 27:16.000* :  which is scattered around the world in a very complex way and so this isn't good news for them
*27:16.000- 27:22.900* :  or their customers. Sir and Judge Hawari, six historically important portraits of the Dutch
*27:22.900- 27:28.160* :  royal family have been returned after they were stolen. The paintings were handed to an art
*27:28.160- 27:33.980* :  detective called Arthur Brand, who made headlines last month after he recovered a van Gogh in
*27:33.980- 27:40.880* :  an IKEA bag. On Friday night, a van stopped in front of my home. It was a half past 10 at night.
*27:40.880- 27:46.880* :  It was raining and he asked me to unload some paintings from his van so I asked him which
*27:46.880- 27:51.420* :  paintings they were and he explained to me that they were from a reason theft in the Netherlands
*27:51.780- 27:56.520* :  and he said I was not involved in the theft but I have them now in a position and I want to get rid
*27:56.520- 28:01.860* :  of them. So I took them and then of course I called the police. We recovered the van Gogh that made
*28:01.860- 28:07.460* :  headlines all over the world and in those news flashes was said that the van Gogh was returned
*28:07.460- 28:12.660* :  because they could not sell it and because of all the fines that were given to the people who got
*28:12.660- 28:18.420* :  arrested they got ages in prison so I think they got nervous and maybe the police is already on
*28:18.420- 28:24.560* :  their trail so I think they just wanted to get rid of this hoping that the police would not
*28:24.560- 28:29.480* :  continue the investigation but the police of course continues the investigation. They will be
*28:29.480- 28:35.600* :  returned to the town of Maidenblik. They are the owners. Dutch art detective Arthur Brand.
*28:36.140- 28:42.640* :  Back now to our main story, President Biden's visit to Israel amid the grief, anger and accusations
*28:42.760- 28:48.280* :  surrounding the deaths of reportedly hundreds of people at a hospital in Gaza on Tuesday evening.
*28:48.960- 28:54.980* :  Hamas blames Israel and anger at the deaths has led Arab leaders to cancel a planned summit with
*28:54.980- 29:01.500* :  a US president. Speaking alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Biden backed the Israeli
*29:01.500- 29:07.320* :  militaries claim that the explosion was caused by a rocket misfired by the Palestinian group Islamic
*29:07.320- 29:13.580* :  Jihad. Our chief international correspondent Lee Zduzet is in southern Israel. She told my colleague
*29:13.580- 29:19.140* :  Sarah Montague that the hospital attack had overshadowed any hope of progress from Mr Biden's visit.
*29:19.840- 29:28.840* :  Even before the horrific incident at a Gaza hospital yesterday evening, President Biden's decision
*29:28.840- 29:37.020* :  to come to the region now was seen as high risk. Now he has flown straight into this crisis
*29:37.020- 29:44.400* :  and not surprisingly, he has expressed a very publicly his complete and utter support for the
*29:44.400- 29:48.800* :  state of Israel. He has done that for the half century he has been in politics and he's been
*29:48.800- 29:56.380* :  thanked profusely by Israeli leaders. The question now is what is he saying behind closed doors?
*29:57.060- 30:02.180* :  The American president's aides who spoke to journalists on their way here said that he would have
*30:02.180- 30:06.740* :  very tough questions. What will he be asking? First of all, he will make clear to Israel in private
*30:07.180- 30:11.140* :  that it will do everything it can to have its back military support, financial support, moral support.
*30:11.780- 30:17.400* :  But in return, it expects Israel to follow the rules of war, to minimize civilian casualties
*30:17.420- 30:23.880* :  and crucially to get a desperately needed aid into the Gaza Strip because Joe Biden knows
*30:23.880- 30:29.120* :  he's been told by his top diplomat, Anthony Blinken, that that is the message from all Arab
*30:29.120- 30:35.540* :  leaders. You have to take care of the citizens, the civilians, the innocent Gazans who are coming
*30:35.540- 30:41.960* :  under non-stop Israeli bombardment. He will also want to make progress on the issue of hostages.
*30:42.660- 30:49.420* :  Everything about this crisis is unprecedented. President Joe Biden has a very, very tough task,
*30:49.900- 30:56.100* :  but he can't leave the region without showing something for his very high risk gamble to come
*30:56.100- 31:00.880* :  here at this time. And what are we expecting that? I mean, is there some hope of aid getting into
*31:00.880- 31:08.000* :  Gaza? We understand that the Israelis are very reluctant to send aid into Gaza because they say
*31:08.000- 31:14.720* :  that it will just be diverted by Hamas and Islamic jihad. But we did hear earlier this morning,
*31:14.720- 31:20.720* :  the Israelis being more specific than they have been saying that Gaza should head further south
*31:20.720- 31:27.580* :  to the coastal area of Al-Mawasi and that they would be given international aid there.
*31:28.020- 31:31.880* :  Now, no other details were given. We haven't heard anything from the United Nations,
*31:31.880- 31:37.900* :  and we certainly haven't heard anything about that one way in and out of Gaza, that rough
*31:37.900- 31:44.160* :  acrossing in southern Gaza into Egypt, Sinai Peninsula, that there's been so much effort,
*31:44.160- 31:49.200* :  including by the Americans in the British, to try to open that, to allow foreign passport holders
*31:49.200- 31:54.480* :  out. Sadly, there's no way out for more than two million Gazans with no other passport.
*31:55.000- 32:00.100* :  And to let that aid, which is piling up on the Egyptian side of the border in, food, fuel, water,
*32:00.680- 32:07.700* :  and food medical supplies desperately need it. But it's a very, very big ask. And all the while
*32:07.700- 32:12.820* :  military activity is intensifying. Where we are here, there's been the constant sound of Israeli
*32:12.820- 32:18.400* :  artillery going into Gaza, heavy machine gun fire, and we see the dark looms of smoke on the
*32:18.400- 32:26.000* :  horizon. Smoke rising from Gaza City, the city where yesterday evening, took place a devastating
*32:26.000- 32:32.240* :  attack that's being described as the worst single strike in all of the five Israel Gaza wars.
*32:32.800- 32:38.560* :  That was Lee's do set. And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global
