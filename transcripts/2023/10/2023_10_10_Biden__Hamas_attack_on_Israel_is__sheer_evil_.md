*01:25.820- 01:28.800* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Wednesday,
*01:28.800- 01:31.820* :  the 11th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:32.380- 01:35.740* :  Joe Biden condemned some ass for its deadly attacks on Israelis,
*01:36.320- 01:37.840* :  including babies being killed.
*01:38.380- 01:40.060* :  This is an act of sheer evil.
*01:41.300- 01:43.980* :  More than 1000 civilians slaughtered.
*01:44.460- 01:46.900* :  I just go slaughtered in Israel.
*01:47.640- 01:51.280* :  Israeli air strikes are reducing much of Gaza to rubble,
*01:51.600- 01:54.700* :  while the blockade adds to the humanitarian crisis there.
*01:55.120- 01:59.060* :  Look to the scale of destruction in the area and how the civilian homes were
*01:59.060- 02:03.140* :  completely affected and some of them were completely destroyed.
*02:03.140- 02:08.340* :  The Israeli military takes journalists to the scene of a massacre of civilians in a kibbutz.
*02:11.300- 02:17.400* :  Also in this podcast, evidence of an explosion at the time a Finnish undersea gas pipeline
*02:17.400- 02:21.420* :  stopped working and the US cuts off aid to Niger,
*02:21.420- 02:24.860* :  one of the world's poorest countries after July's coup.
*02:28.460- 02:33.120* :  Israel counts the United States as its closest ally and at the White House,
*02:33.120- 02:38.580* :  President Biden pledged America's full support in its war against the Palestinian militant
*02:38.580- 02:44.340* :  group Hamas. He said the gunman who broke out of Gaza and into southern Israel on Saturday
*02:45.000- 02:46.280* :  had committed a massacre.
*02:46.880- 02:48.220* :  You know, there are moments in this life,
*02:49.000- 02:55.280* :  I mean this literally when the pure unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world.
*02:55.600- 02:59.420* :  The people of Israel live through one such moment this weekend.
*03:00.180- 03:02.940* :  The bloody hands of the terrorist organization Hamas,
*03:03.380- 03:06.880* :  a group who stated purpose for being is to kill Jews
*03:07.680- 03:11.120* :  more than 1000 civilians slaughtered in Israel,
*03:11.720- 03:13.840* :  among them at least 14 American citizens.
*03:14.560- 03:21.240* :  President Biden also confirmed that US citizens were among an estimated 150 Israelis and foreigners
*03:21.240- 03:27.900* :  being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. He said he was ready to order extra US military forces
*03:27.900- 03:33.540* :  to the region to act as a deterrent to any force thinking of taking advantage of the crisis.
*03:34.020- 03:39.800* :  Mr. Biden spoke after his third phone call in four days with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*03:39.800- 03:44.980* :  Netanyahu. We also discussed how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger
*03:45.060- 03:53.260* :  and more secure when we act according to the rule of law. Terrorists purposely target civilians.
*03:53.380- 03:59.140* :  We uphold the laws of war. It matters. There's a difference. Let there be no doubt.
*03:59.140- 04:04.080* :  The United States has Israel's back. We will make sure that Jewish and Democratic
*04:04.080- 04:08.400* :  State of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have.
*04:09.280- 04:11.300* :  We're with Israel. Let's make no mistake.
*04:11.960- 04:18.020* :  More than 3,000 people have now died in Israel and the Gaza Strip in a war with no end in sight.
*04:18.520- 04:22.420* :  They include more than a thousand victims of the original Hamas-led assault,
*04:22.420- 04:26.580* :  at least 1,500 of the gunmen who carried out Saturday's assault,
*04:26.920- 04:30.700* :  and more than 800 who died in Israel's attacks on Gaza since.
*04:31.100- 04:34.600* :  Rockets were still being fired in both directions late into the night.
*04:35.060- 04:40.460* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem John Donerson told me more about Tuesday's developments.
*04:41.400- 04:45.160* :  Israel had promised its retaliation was only just beginning and for a fourth day
*04:45.160- 04:51.240* :  its air force has continued to pound Gaza overnight. They hit more than 200 targets.
*04:51.240- 04:56.740* :  A lot of them in the Ramal district, which is right in the center of Gaza City.
*04:56.740- 05:03.480* :  I mean, whole streets there reduced to rebel. You've multi-story blocks burned out or simply
*05:03.920- 05:07.180* :  flattened a lot of people, I think, and were just following their neighborhoods.
*05:07.180- 05:13.980* :  Just in a state of complete disrepair. You've got now close to 200,000 Palestinians in Gaza
*05:14.440- 05:18.620* :  living in UN shelters or seeking shelter in UN schools.
*05:19.540- 05:24.600* :  At the same time, there has been renewed intensification of rocket fire out of Gaza.
*05:24.880- 05:28.580* :  Hamas issued a warning saying that they were going to fire out of Gaza at five o'clock
*05:28.580- 05:31.880* :  towards the Israeli city of Ashkalan, virtually on the dot.
*05:31.920- 05:38.540* :  They did so and you had a barrage, a barrage, a rocket heading towards that city in southern Israel.
*05:39.280- 05:44.080* :  Yeah, we've been hearing from the defense minister who says the army is moving towards
*05:44.080- 05:51.080* :  full-scale offensive in Gaza. That's what he said. Yes, he said that he had released all the restraints
*05:51.220- 05:57.400* :  and that the army had regained control of that southern area around Gaza and that they were
*05:57.400- 06:04.320* :  moving to full offense. He said that Hamas will regret this moment and Gaza will never return
*06:04.320- 06:10.100* :  to what it was. So there has been growing speculation or expectation that some sort of ground
*06:10.100- 06:15.820* :  operation is coming and the defense minister seemed to be suggesting that was the case.
*06:16.200- 06:21.720* :  John Donerson, the two million also Palestinians now living under siege as they seek shelter
*06:21.720- 06:28.400* :  from Israeli air strikes are facing a humanitarian crisis. The small town of Khan Unis in the south
*06:28.400- 06:34.240* :  of the Gaza Strip is among those that have been targeted by Israeli air strikes. Masha' El Farah lived
*06:34.240- 06:40.840* :  there. People who were ordered by the Israeli army to leave the eastern province borders in the
*06:40.840- 06:46.600* :  Gaza of an Israel hundreds of families, thousands of people moved. Some of them managed to find
*06:46.600- 06:52.060* :  accommodations but many of them hundreds are on the streets and some of them seek shelter under
*06:52.740- 06:56.980* :  buildings, including this municipality building which has a little shopping area under it. So the
*06:56.980- 07:02.840* :  building came down on them. Our reporter in Gaza, Rusty Abu Alouf spent the day assessing the
*07:02.840- 07:09.300* :  damaged caused by Israeli air strikes in the central commercial area of Gaza City where many people
*07:13.480- 07:17.720* :  live. People just want us to leave this area because it seems the Israelis are going to
*07:17.720- 07:23.240* :  target another building but very quickly if we can see the scale of destruction in this neighborhood,
*07:23.240- 07:29.320* :  it's called Dremel neighborhood, it's the economic hub for Gaza that has been completely targeted,
*07:29.320- 07:34.260* :  yesterday many buildings were destroyed. Behind me is 11 story a building that was
*07:34.660- 07:40.220* :  looked down two days ago but the destruction in this area, it's been targeted last night.
*07:40.500- 07:45.140* :  They hit many government buildings along to the Hamas ran authority but looked to the scale of
*07:45.140- 07:50.940* :  destruction in the area and how the civilian homes were completely affected and some of them
*07:50.940- 07:57.080* :  were completely destroyed. Rusty Abu Alouf reporting from Gaza, Francesca Al-Banesi, the United
*07:57.080- 08:03.240* :  Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, says that Israel's action could
*08:03.240- 08:10.200* :  have devastating consequences. Gaza was already under a lawful blockade and the cutoff of
*08:10.960- 08:17.240* :  any type of aid and the session shot services like medicines, food, electricity,
*08:17.380- 08:26.380* :  my lead to starvation and this must stop. Causing starvation is a crime against humanity,
*08:26.380- 08:33.120* :  it's extremely serious and has already been denounced by a number of international experts
*08:33.120- 08:39.520* :  and agencies. On Tuesday the Israeli army allowed journalists into the Kibbutz town of Kaffir
*08:39.520- 08:45.820* :  Gaza where many families were killed in their homes by Hamas Gunman, international editor Jeremy
*08:45.820- 08:50.480* :  Bowen has been to the scene warning parts of this report are distressing.
*08:53.980- 08:58.380* :  We've arrived at one of the frontline Kibbutz's here, invited by the Israeli army at a time
*08:58.380- 09:03.580* :  of what's clearly a serious incident. There are several hundred combat soldiers here,
*09:04.260- 09:09.040* :  a lot of vehicles and been firing over the border into Gaza. When you came to Berlin here,
*09:09.340- 09:14.400* :  what did you see? Chaos, terrorists everywhere. How difficult was the fighting?
*09:15.780- 09:19.020* :  You can't have to imagine. Have you ever had to do anything like this before as a soldier?
*09:19.600- 09:20.420* :  Nothing, I'll aid you.
*09:23.960- 09:30.360* :  Just had to take cover because there was no alarm as a rocket coming in and the nearest place was the
*09:30.360- 09:37.400* :  home of a woman and her family whose bodies are still lying outside their now.
*09:38.400- 09:42.020* :  You can smell decomposing flesh in the air, the weather is hot.
*09:43.240- 09:51.080* :  The bodies of the dead Hamas Gunman are still there, some bloated and distended by decomposition already.
*09:53.680- 09:58.540* :  The war is very close to here, we're right on the border with Gaza and you can hear it,
*09:58.900- 10:04.200* :  the whole time, a barrage, fishing and fire and in the midst of all of that,
*10:05.140- 10:10.140* :  the soldiers are trying to clear these houses, not just pick up the dead but look as well for
*10:10.140- 10:16.360* :  unexploded ordnance, things that could cause the minjuries. I'm surrounded here in this part of
*10:16.360- 10:21.480* :  the Kibbutz by a robber. By the remains of people's lives, sofers that they would sit out in the evenings
*10:21.480- 10:26.740* :  probably, there's a sort of a robber ring on a rack there which looks like kids probably play with
*10:26.740- 10:31.680* :  wind chimes. People lived here partly because of the quality of life you could get in the countryside
*10:32.780- 10:39.540* :  and also an assurance that they believed in that Israel, their government, their army would keep
*10:39.540- 10:46.540* :  them safe. And in charge of all the men here, the senior Israeli officer is Major General Peruvian
*10:46.540- 10:54.320* :  with him now. I know that Israelis have suffered a great deal and are suffering.
*10:55.760- 11:00.220* :  There are 2.4 million people, a few miles from here in Gaza, including many civilians,
*11:00.860- 11:04.960* :  not connected with Hamas, many of whom are being killed. What do you say to that?
*11:05.480- 11:10.500* :  We are not terrorists. We are soldiers and we are western country and we know and we
*11:10.500- 11:17.860* :  crush the Hamas and we kill them all. I hope so. But we will still human be until our last
*11:17.860- 11:23.080* :  death. There's no sense in which you are suspending your obligations under the laws of war because
*11:23.080- 11:28.720* :  of the extent of the emergency facing a threat. I know that we fight for our value and I know that
*11:28.720- 11:35.680* :  we will be very aggressive, but we keep our moral and our value. We are Israeli, we are Jewish
*11:35.680- 11:43.580* :  and you know, war is a very difficult tear, tear, a lot of problems. People that stay in the
*11:43.580- 11:48.340* :  battlefield are suffered a lot. You can see what happened in here, but we come to kill the enemy,
*11:48.620- 11:55.540* :  not the civilians in the event. That report from Jeremy Bowen. There's a particular agony for
*11:55.540- 12:00.120* :  those who've lost people and the massacres of Saturday and those who still don't know,
*12:00.500- 12:07.300* :  like Jonathan Ziegler, his 75-year-old mother, Vivian Silver, lived in Kibbutz-Biori, close to the
*12:07.300- 12:13.080* :  border with Gaza. On Saturday morning, Hamas gunman swept in while Vivian was on the phone to her
*12:13.080- 12:18.940* :  son, Tim Franks spoke to Jonathan on the balcony of his small apartment in Tel Aviv.
*12:20.060- 12:23.260* :  We've been talking on the phone, trying to understand what's going on,
*12:24.160- 12:30.560* :  I heard over the phone a lot of gunshots outside her window, so we decided to stop speaking,
*12:30.560- 12:38.580* :  so she won't be heard and we started corresponding through WhatsApp. She was still joking with me
*12:39.300- 12:44.120* :  because that's the kind of woman she was and then she wrote me that they're inside the house
*12:44.900- 12:52.460* :  and that no more jokes. I wrote each other messages of love and that was it. She stopped being
*12:52.460- 13:00.380* :  connected to WhatsApp at 11.07 Saturday morning. You must have been frantic. What did you try to do?
*13:00.800- 13:08.140* :  So I just waited. Then it started to sink in to process the fact that she's dead.
*13:08.720- 13:18.040* :  It does not much doing in those moments. I was pretty shut down, but as it continued to unfold,
*13:18.180- 13:23.900* :  frantic is the correct word. I started talking to people, trying to get information.
*13:24.180- 13:32.160* :  Not a lot of people reached out to me, so I sunk in my phone to communicate with the world.
*13:32.740- 13:36.720* :  Tell me a little bit about the sort of women your mother is.
*13:37.400- 13:46.320* :  My mother was a peace worker. She dedicated her life to peace and equality
*13:46.920- 13:52.300* :  through organizations that she was a part of and ran also through volunteering,
*13:53.240- 14:00.880* :  through speaking out up until recently, she would drive sick Palestinians from Gaza to Israeli hospitals.
*14:01.520- 14:04.420* :  I asked you about the sort of women your mother is and you said
*14:05.200- 14:12.040* :  my mother was. You obviously do fear that you may not see her again.
*14:12.700- 14:20.360* :  Yes, I noticed that as well. I think I corrected myself. I moved from past tense to present tense.
*14:21.280- 14:29.660* :  It's just so very confusing and stressful. Although I am optimistic, a country can't leave so many
*14:29.660- 14:37.020* :  captive people, elderly women, children without getting them out. I call on the Israeli government
*14:37.020- 14:44.160* :  to use diplomacy and negotiate. I understand it's not really a consensus here, but I think
*14:44.940- 14:51.020* :  that's the right way to go. From where I'm sitting, it seems like our infrastructure is collapsed.
*14:51.840- 14:58.720* :  In Israel, if we're talking about our visibility to react and defend citizens,
*14:58.720- 15:04.460* :  all about information, but it's pretty hurtful and frustrating.
*15:05.220- 15:11.220* :  You've painted a picture of your mother having spent her life dedicated to
*15:12.160- 15:16.660* :  trying against all the odds. As you put it for an end to the occupation,
*15:17.420- 15:23.160* :  if you were to think of the message she would want to convey,
*15:24.140- 15:27.820* :  can you think of what it is it might be that she would want to say?
*15:28.480- 15:35.240* :  You know, the only way to be safe is with peace. It's just a vicious circle.
*15:35.740- 15:41.180* :  You know, there's a term in Israel, everybody uses, we live on our sword, you live on your sword,
*15:41.180- 15:49.240* :  you get cut. Jonathan Ziegler speaking to the BBC's Tim Franks. Now, do you have questions
*15:49.240- 15:56.320* :  about the crisis in the Middle East? Here's my colleague, Jackie Leonard. Hello. Events in Israel
*15:56.320- 16:00.060* :  and Gaza have prompted many of you to get in touch with your questions.
*16:00.180- 16:06.100* :  And we hope to answer as many of them as possible in a special global news podcast coming soon.
*16:06.720- 16:10.980* :  So, what do you want to know? Some of the questions we've had so far, how do we get here?
*16:10.980- 16:15.560* :  What's at the root of the conflict? What are both sides saying? What happens next?
*16:15.560- 16:22.880* :  Ask us anything you want to know to help you understand. As ever, send us an email or voice message
*16:22.900- 16:29.440* :  to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. Thank you.
*16:31.460- 16:38.380* :  Other stories now. Finland has suggested damage to an undersea gas pipeline and a telecommunications
*16:38.380- 16:45.060* :  cable linking to Estonia was caused by external action. The Norwegian seismological institute
*16:45.060- 16:52.460* :  Norsar said it detected a probable blast on Saturday night in the Baltic Sea near where the gas
*16:52.460- 16:57.120* :  pipeline leak was discovered on Sunday. Finland's prime minister is Pateri Orpo.
*17:00.420- 17:04.740* :  According to a preliminary assessment, it is likely that the damage is the result of external
*17:04.740- 17:11.160* :  activity. Mr. Orpo said the same applied to a communication cable. It's feared the damage could
*17:11.160- 17:17.000* :  take months to repair. So, is this sabotage with more details? Here's Danny Aberhardt.
*17:17.320- 17:22.900* :  Finland's prime minister said that basically it's too early to say who or what caused the damage
*17:22.900- 17:28.120* :  to the gas pipeline. They know where the damage took place on the gas pipeline. They don't know yet
*17:28.120- 17:33.880* :  where the damage to the communication cable was. Estonia's gas network also said that sabotage
*17:33.880- 17:38.920* :  remains a possibility. That's what they're looking at. There are further investigations going on
*17:38.920- 17:43.920* :  as we speak. I think the fear is that Russia may be behind this. This is a pipeline that goes over
*17:43.920- 17:51.020* :  the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic. It's Finland's only direct connection to the wider EU gas network.
*17:51.020- 17:56.940* :  And Finland used to get most of its gas from Russia via pipeline, but Russia closed off the pipeline
*17:56.940- 18:03.480* :  last year. Russia wanted Finland to pay in rubles and Helsinki refused. So since then Finland has
*18:03.480- 18:09.700* :  relied on this gas pipeline, which is relatively new, and also from liquefied natural gas. So
*18:09.700- 18:15.040* :  at the moment it's having to rely exclusively on liquefied natural gas for all its gas.
*18:15.460- 18:22.180* :  It says that its supply is secure. The big incident was last year in September when three of the four
*18:22.180- 18:28.400* :  Nord Stream gas pipelines were taken out in explosions under the Baltic. Those were pipelines
*18:28.400- 18:34.080* :  some of which already took gas from Russia to Germany. Some were about to, but that really highlighted
*18:34.080- 18:40.240* :  just how vulnerable some key parts of Europe's energy infrastructure are. Since then countries
*18:40.240- 18:45.100* :  across Europe have said they've heightened security, but how do you in practice secure
*18:45.100- 18:51.360* :  undersea gas pipelines? It's extremely difficult. Danny Aberhardt. The Swedish capital
*18:51.360- 18:56.980* :  Stockholm is banning all petrol and diesel vehicles from its centre. The restrictions will
*18:56.980- 19:02.960* :  cover 20 blocks in the heart of the city and come into force at the end of 2024. The zone might
*19:02.960- 19:10.980* :  expand the following year. Shemay Opebo in Stockholm told me more. Well it all started in 2018 actually
*19:10.980- 19:15.300* :  because the Swedish government then decided that it would be possible for local authorities to
*19:15.300- 19:20.820* :  create so-called environmental zones to improve air quality. And since then there was a study that
*19:20.820- 19:27.040* :  was released in 2022 from the Carolinska Institute that said that children who grow up in roads
*19:27.040- 19:33.000* :  in Stockholm that have high emissions have worse than average lung capacity when compared to other
*19:33.000- 19:37.640* :  children from as early as six months old. So this is really something quite serious when you're
*19:37.640- 19:42.820* :  thinking about infants lungs being less effective and adults dying earlier. So I think on the basis
*19:42.820- 19:47.660* :  of that study the city of Stockholm decided hey we need to do something. They've decided to limit
*19:47.660- 19:52.740* :  the dangerous emissions from petrol and diesel cars in the city and that's why they're introducing
*19:52.740- 19:58.560* :  this new Class III environmental zone in one part of the city centre. That is the public on board
*19:58.560- 20:02.040* :  with this. There are some people that are really on board with it and there are others that are
*20:02.040- 20:06.080* :  concerned. What does it mean for people that already have cars, citizens that live in Stockholm
*20:06.080- 20:12.080* :  that have petrol or diesel cars? Not everybody can afford a completely electric vehicle. So I think
*20:12.080- 20:16.160* :  that that's where you're seeing a lot of tension and discussion at the moment. There's also people
*20:16.160- 20:20.740* :  that are wondering what does it actually mean? Who's allowed in? Who's not? What are the exceptions
*20:20.740- 20:26.260* :  to this? There's been a lot of discussion with passengers and drivers who have disabled parking permits
*20:26.260- 20:30.820* :  wondering if they'll still be allowed into the city centre because they need their cars. There are
*20:30.820- 20:35.180* :  other cities that also have heavy traffic in the city centres. So I think that as they're now
*20:35.500- 20:40.940* :  starting this sold out that will be at the end of December 2024 is when it's going to come into
*20:40.940- 20:46.240* :  force and then in 2025 it will be increased. I think that based on what kind of emissions are
*20:46.240- 20:51.200* :  seen after that I would believe that there would be an interest to do it in other cities in Sweden.
*21:10.580- 21:16.660* :  Jihadist insurgents. The State Department said it would only restore assistance if the
*21:16.660- 21:22.640* :  co-leaders ushered in a democratic government. I asked that Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton
*21:22.640- 21:29.840* :  what this means for Niger. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world and one of the
*21:29.840- 21:37.660* :  poorest countries in Africa and it will undoubtedly be a lot poorer now. So something like 500 million
*21:38.020- 21:45.060* :  of American financial aid which was to go towards agriculture, infrastructure, education,
*21:45.280- 21:51.960* :  things like that. That's all disappearing overnight so Niger many people think will go down the
*21:51.960- 21:57.780* :  plug hole. And what will this mean for the American military presence? At the moment the United
*21:57.780- 22:05.380* :  States has around a thousand American troops in Niger. They've always used it as a stable hub
*22:05.380- 22:11.540* :  in which to then help the combat against Islamist militants and they also have a drone base in
*22:11.540- 22:19.600* :  Agadez in Niger. So unlike the French who this very day have started their withdrawal the Americans
*22:19.600- 22:25.900* :  for now at least say they're staying put but it's not inconceivable that they will also withdraw.
*22:26.500- 22:31.000* :  If America withholds his funds this presumably creates an opportunity for other players
*22:31.000- 22:37.560* :  such as Russia. That's the biggest concern militarily, financially and at the moment
*22:37.700- 22:45.000* :  Washington is saying there's no evidence that the Russian mercenary group Wagner is actively in
*22:45.000- 22:51.820* :  Niger but it's not rocket science to work out that that's exactly what Moscow and Wagner want.
*22:51.820- 22:57.100* :  They want to make inroads into Niger and like other countries in the Sahel like Marley and
*22:57.100- 23:03.580* :  Bikina Faso these military junters are looking towards Russia for help so it's pretty obvious
*23:03.580- 23:11.160* :  that that's where Niger will go now. Richard Hamilton. Researchers say they've edited the DNA
*23:11.160- 23:16.600* :  of chickens to make them partially resistant to bird flu and that it might be possible to block
*23:16.600- 23:21.760* :  the virus completely. The results published in the journal Nature suggest that making further
*23:21.760- 23:27.660* :  changes to the birds genes could produce fully immune chickens and also tackle problems that
*23:27.660- 23:32.660* :  arise from high-density farming. Our science correspondent Palau Ghosh reports.
*23:33.480- 23:39.420* :  Bird flu is a major global threat with a devastating impact on both farmed and wild birds.
*23:40.140- 23:44.440* :  Researchers have been trying to create varieties of chickens that are immune to the disease.
*23:45.080- 23:50.400* :  The team identified three genes involved and using a technique called gene editing
*23:50.400- 23:57.200* :  made small changes to one of them that mostly but not completely stop the virus from reproducing
*23:57.200- 24:03.380* :  in the chicken's bodies without any harmful effects to the birds. That made the chickens partially
*24:03.380- 24:09.720* :  resistant when given a high dose of the virus according to Professor Wendy Barkley of Imperial College.
*24:10.060- 24:15.760* :  What this showed us is a proof of concept that we can move towards making chickens resistant to
*24:15.760- 24:22.060* :  the virus but we're not there yet that we would need more robust edits to really stop down the virus
*24:22.060- 24:27.660* :  replication. The researchers found that when all three genes were switched off in an experiment with
*24:27.660- 24:34.320* :  cells in a test tube, the virus stopped multiplying altogether. The next step is to reproduce the
*24:34.320- 24:40.760* :  result in gene edited chickens which they're confident of doing in three years time. Palau Ghosh.
*24:41.640- 24:49.260* :  Now to a tale of adventure, exploring misfortune, endurance, and recovery. This is the story of
*24:49.260- 24:55.380* :  24-year-old Australian extreme rower Tom Robinson who was attempting to break a world record
*24:55.780- 25:02.200* :  and become the youngest person to row across the Pacific Ocean. A huge wave capsized vessel
*25:02.200- 25:08.360* :  on the final leg. Nulamagavan picks up the story just as help arrives a bit after day break
*25:08.360- 25:13.840* :  the next morning. What went through his mind during the 14 hours that he was left clinging
*25:14.760- 25:20.640* :  naked to his hand-made rowing boat? It's a long time. A lot of things went through my mind. I think
*25:20.640- 25:25.460* :  first it was just the initial shock of oh my god this worst nightmare situation that you think
*25:25.460- 25:30.040* :  about on and off for the whole journey has actually happened and then you climb on top of the boat
*25:30.420- 25:34.040* :  and everything seems really really awful. You're wondering if you're going to survive
*25:34.840- 25:38.920* :  and then you start to have a glimmer of hope. You just got to hold onto it and you can't let the
*25:38.920- 25:43.680* :  negative thoughts come in and so I was setting myself goals for every few hours. What was going to
*25:43.680- 25:48.380* :  happen next and then I told myself that by the time the sun came up, hopefully I would see a ship
*25:48.380- 25:53.940* :  and I did. So it was this huge sense of relief that help had arrived. And that was the cruise ship?
*25:54.220- 25:58.460* :  That was the cruise ship. Yes, I was in the nude during all this because I often roy with our
*25:58.460- 26:03.440* :  clothes and to stop chase the less clothing you've got on the bedder. So when you're rowing with
*26:03.440- 26:08.300* :  clothes on and there's a bit of a sea going then you're constantly getting splashed with water
*26:08.300- 26:13.720* :  and waves and that leaves salt all over your skin and then when you've got clothes on that really
*26:13.760- 26:19.740* :  traps the salt onto your skin and the skin starts to rub and then it gets raw and it really is very
*26:19.740- 26:23.660* :  painful. So when I saw the ship I assumed it was a container vessel which I thought well that's
*26:23.660- 26:27.940* :  good. There'll only be 15 or 20 crew on board and then as the ship got closer I realized there
*26:27.940- 26:32.360* :  was a cruise ship and so there were literally hundreds or thousands of people lining the decks with
*26:32.480- 26:39.280* :  cameras and binoculars. Oh, it's kind of modesty. Go out the window obviously at that case because
*26:39.280- 26:44.480* :  it's a life or death situation but did it give you any pause? Yes, the fact you weren't wearing
*26:44.480- 26:48.960* :  any clothes in front of thousands of people? It did more than it should have. The unfortunate thing
*26:48.960- 26:53.520* :  was that it was a very cold night. It was very uncomfortable for me. You can see in the footage of
*26:53.520- 26:58.760* :  me being rescued of trying to cover up as best I can. They threw down a row bladder and I scrambled
*26:58.760- 27:04.380* :  up the row bladder and there was people watching this whole rescue effort really. Hundreds of
*27:04.380- 27:08.440* :  people lining the decks with their cameras. How do you feel when you think about that moment?
*27:08.440- 27:15.300* :  It's all still very new and strange but that sort of image in my mind of the boat being turned
*27:15.300- 27:21.340* :  upside down so violently and so quickly that's a reoccurring image in my mind and it is still quite
*27:21.340- 27:28.040* :  frightening and it's all very strange and quite scary. I've been back home in Brisbane for almost
*27:28.040- 27:33.020* :  24 hours now. What are you doing? I just had dinner with the family so nice to just be with
*27:33.020- 27:37.860* :  the family. It's quite a lot to process, huh? Hmm, a hell of a lot to process. I think this might
*27:37.860- 27:43.460* :  be too early to ask you Tom but do you think you try it again? I want to say no but perhaps I will.
*27:43.700- 27:48.800* :  I'm really not sure yet. There's a small chance that my vessel may wash up on a beach in Australia
*27:49.200- 27:53.320* :  in a few months' time and so if that did happen then it was still in one piece which I think it
*27:53.320- 27:58.740* :  should be then it would be tempting to try again definitely. I had a dream like that once.
*27:59.260- 28:04.160* :  24-year-old Australian rower Tom Robinson speaking to Nulamagavan.
*28:07.180- 28:12.780* :  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
