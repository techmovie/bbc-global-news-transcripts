*00:17.020- 00:21.600* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*00:21.880- 00:25.360* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets.
*00:25.500- 00:28.780* :  I was overwhelmed, like I'd never seen anything like this.
*00:29.000- 00:31.660* :  At the height of Abercrombie and Fitch's success.
*00:31.940- 00:34.340* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.
*00:34.660- 00:37.540* :  Being lied to, tricked and traded like a commodity.
*00:37.900- 00:43.580* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money, sex and power.
*00:44.560- 00:49.260* :  This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
*00:49.540- 00:51.660* :  Listen, wherever you get your podcasts.
*00:55.960- 00:58.460* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:00.840- 01:05.600* :  I'm Nick Mars and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday 5 October, these are our main stories.
*01:05.600- 01:11.940* :  European leaders have met in Spain with concerns about US support for Ukraine at the top of the agenda.
*01:12.540- 01:17.560* :  A glacier lake overflows in the Indian Himalayas flooding several towns.
*01:18.200- 01:20.360* :  We get the latest on the many people missing.
*01:22.520- 01:26.220* :  Also in this podcast, we hear about Ukraine's entry for the Oscars,
*01:26.220- 01:29.560* :  a documentary called 20 Days in Mara-Yupor.
*01:30.080- 01:33.020* :  And this year's winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.
*01:36.580- 01:40.300* :  When European heads of state get together these days, there is one issue that
*01:40.300- 01:44.240* :  always tends to be near the top of the agenda, the war in Ukraine.
*01:44.240- 01:49.320* :  Other weekend, the US Congress was forced to drop plans for new financial aid to the country
*01:49.320- 01:53.240* :  to avert a government shutdown. The ousting of the Republican leader,
*01:53.240- 01:57.300* :  Alpha House of Representatives, has added to the uncertainty over aid.
*01:57.760- 02:02.380* :  And that's really concerning the 48 European leaders who've gathered in Grenada in Spain.
*02:02.380- 02:07.220* :  On his way into the summit, the European Union's most senior diplomat, Joseph Borrell,
*02:07.620- 02:12.600* :  issued a warning that EU countries would not be able to make up the loss in US support.
*02:13.140- 02:19.120* :  Certainly, Europe cannot replace the US. Europe is increasing its support.
*02:20.000- 02:25.620* :  In the table, there are proposals for 50 billion euro for the civilian and economic side,
*02:26.140- 02:32.840* :  and 20 billion for the military side. And we did that before waiting for the US to take
*02:32.840- 02:36.340* :  decisions. Just before we recorded this podcast, the Ukrainian president,
*02:36.340- 02:41.060* :  Volodymyr Zelensky, addressed the summit. He told European leaders that his country was
*02:41.060- 02:44.900* :  defending itself against Russia to ensure European security.
*02:45.660- 02:51.920* :  Thanks to Ukraine, your soldiers are not fighting against Russia right now.
*02:51.920- 02:59.320* :  And we do not doubt NATO's trends. But I'm sure none of you wants to find out what it will
*02:59.320- 03:06.100* :  be like if God forbid, NATO has to stand up for one of you. We have to win in Ukraine,
*03:06.100- 03:12.300* :  so that Putin cannot scale this aggression to someone else, and it is realistic.
*03:13.140- 03:17.280* :  I've been speaking to our diplomatic correspondent, James Landel, who's in Grenada.
*03:18.280- 03:22.680* :  Well, I think there is a concern. Diplomats and policymakers across Europe are now trying to work
*03:22.680- 03:27.180* :  out what they can do if that is to happen. They know it's not going to happen immediately.
*03:27.180- 03:32.320* :  But certainly, if you talk to any leaders here, they have been all falling over themselves
*03:32.320- 03:35.800* :  to reassure Ukraine and each other that support will continue.
*03:36.120- 03:40.740* :  But as you had heard in that clip from Joseph Barrel, if the US pulls out all of its support,
*03:40.740- 03:45.840* :  then Europe simply does not have the capacity to fill what the United States has been
*03:45.840- 03:50.380* :  providing, especially in terms of military support. So it's a concern at the moment,
*03:50.380- 03:55.540* :  but I think that there is still a sense of trying to plan for it rather than expect it.
*03:56.000- 04:00.220* :  So a sense of unity over that, to a certain extent. What about on another key issue that's
*04:00.220- 04:04.960* :  being discussed there? Migration. That has been overtaken a little bit by Ukraine in the last
*04:04.960- 04:10.020* :  few hours. But that's an issue that there does need to be some kind of unanimity on, doesn't it?
*04:10.700- 04:17.580* :  Most of the discussions about immigration across Europe tend to be about sharing the burden of
*04:17.580- 04:23.480* :  migration. If one country has a large number of rides, how does that burden share it with other
*04:23.480- 04:29.060* :  European countries? It's quite often discussions about policies to return migrants from other
*04:29.060- 04:35.340* :  countries. In the UK, specifically, there's debate and policy about how to try to stop people
*04:35.340- 04:38.660* :  crossing the Channel and small boats. I think what's the British Prime Minister's issue,
*04:38.660- 04:43.200* :  Sunak and the Italian Prime Minister, Jordan Maloney, want to do, is to try and say, look,
*04:43.200- 04:48.660* :  we need to think about preventing this migration happening in the first place, to think of its
*04:48.660- 04:54.060* :  root causes, in other words, tackling people's smugglers and tightening up borders. And I think
*04:54.060- 04:59.760* :  that's the discussion that will be had, at least by some of the leaders here. But this is an
*04:59.760- 05:05.980* :  unofficial informal meeting. It's not a summit where big decisions are made and pieces of paper
*05:05.980- 05:10.720* :  with large plans are signed up to. And James, there was one other issue that is there,
*05:10.720- 05:15.120* :  is that the Armenians were supposed to get together at this summit. That has not happened.
*05:15.120- 05:19.140* :  There's a great disappointment there. Yeah, I think there's disappointment there, not
*05:19.140- 05:25.560* :  at least because this is a new kind of summit. It's only the third of its kind. It was set up by
*05:25.560- 05:31.880* :  President Macron of France after Russia's invasion of Ukraine to be sort of a venue, a forum for
*05:31.880- 05:36.960* :  countries that are not just those in the EU, but also those outside the EU within Europe to
*05:36.960- 05:41.540* :  discuss issues like this. And as you say, there was an expectation that the leaders of Armenia and
*05:42.020- 05:47.460* :  Azerbaijan would meet. That's not now happening because the Azerbaijanis pulled out in a dispute
*05:47.740- 05:53.760* :  over the Turkish role in any discussions that we're going to take place. So I think that there is
*05:53.780- 05:57.920* :  a sense that, you know, this summit has sort of missed a trick. This could have been a moment where
*05:58.420- 06:03.060* :  as a sort of new diplomatic organisation, it could have shown its full colours. It hasn't got
*06:03.060- 06:08.500* :  that opportunity now. James Landau. Let's head to India now, where rescue workers are searching
*06:08.500- 06:13.960* :  for more than a hundred missing people after flash floods swamped several towns in the northeast
*06:13.960- 06:20.860* :  state of Sikkim, 14 people and known to have died so far. Video footage shows the muddy water surging
*06:20.860- 06:26.160* :  into built up areas causing houses to collapse. I got more from the BBC's Mayoresh Kona, who's
*06:26.160- 06:32.780* :  monitoring events from Mumbai. The situation is still serious and the rescue operation is going on
*06:32.780- 06:37.320* :  the north part of the Sikkim. This is a very nearly area in the north eastern part of India.
*06:37.900- 06:44.100* :  So not so easy to carry out any rescue operation, but what we have been told is the national
*06:44.100- 06:49.560* :  disaster management force has been heavily deployed along with this much help from the Indian army
*06:49.560- 06:56.800* :  as well. As we can confirm, over 22,000 people have still been directly affected and 21 relief
*06:56.800- 07:03.460* :  camps have been operated so far. Yesterday, there was a serious news story about 23 army
*07:03.460- 07:09.000* :  personnel also being missing in these floods. And what we can confirm that one army Jawan has
*07:09.000- 07:16.840* :  been rescued but still they search for 22 and over 100 people are still missing. Another cause
*07:16.840- 07:23.860* :  of concern is this is tourist destination for many Indians and over 3,000 tourists are currently in
*07:23.860- 07:31.460* :  this holy state of Sikkim. So most of them are stranded in various locations and so their
*07:31.460- 07:37.680* :  safety is also one of the most important tasks in front of state government and also the respected
*07:37.680- 07:42.100* :  governments of other states from which the students have gone to Sikkim.
*07:42.320- 07:46.520* :  Amar, it's pretty flay. What were the sequences of events that led to this? It was just a
*07:46.520- 07:51.920* :  serious amount of rain. Yes, actually this situation started getting serious yesterday afternoon
*07:52.320- 07:57.760* :  and what their media has been informed. That is, it is possibly the extreme condition because of
*07:57.760- 08:04.300* :  cloud burst and this is not the entire Sikkim state, only the northern part of Sikkim. There is
*08:04.300- 08:12.600* :  a collision lake that caused a kind of a heavy rain pouring in this part and also there is a
*08:12.600- 08:19.860* :  lake down the south of Lona because it was overfered at the dam lake and so the extra water was
*08:19.860- 08:25.120* :  released from the dam that really caused the floods and people were caught of them.
*08:25.900- 08:32.840* :  Myresh Konner in Mumbai. Pakistan's government has ordered all unauthorized Afghan asylum
*08:32.840- 08:37.940* :  seekers to leave the country within a month. Currently there are more than 4 million Afghan
*08:37.940- 08:43.720* :  refugees in Pakistan of whom just under half are unregistered. The crackdown applies to all
*08:43.720- 08:48.880* :  nationalities but the vast majority of migrants are Afghans. I corresponded Anna Foster spoke
*08:48.880- 08:55.060* :  to two Afghan women in Islamabad, Nagis Karima, who is 37 and her sister Sara, who is 14.
*08:55.180- 09:01.520* :  Nagis worked as a journalist and left Kabul with her family after the Taliban take over in 2021.
*09:02.280- 09:06.620* :  She had a visa and could stay in Pakistan but her father and her sister came illegally.
*09:06.700- 09:13.540* :  She told us what daily life is like in Pakistan. Day by day it's a very difficult living in Pakistan,
*09:14.120- 09:20.740* :  the government of Pakistan and the security system is getting harder and for mostly for
*09:21.260- 09:28.520* :  people who don't have valid visas and they captured them and take them to the police and they
*09:28.520- 09:35.600* :  arrest them and they torture them and my small sister's visa is also finished. So I really
*09:35.600- 09:41.400* :  scared that maybe they harmed my family, my father and my small sisters. As you know we don't trust
*09:41.400- 09:49.880* :  them my sister is she's very small she's 14 years we scared about her and for her her educations.
*09:50.840- 09:55.900* :  Yeah please Sara tell me about about how things are for you at the moment especially now that
*09:56.760- 10:01.420* :  you're faced with the possibility of not being able to stay. It's really hard in this
*10:01.420- 10:06.160* :  situation because we are allowed to and we couldn't get out of our houses because of the situation
*10:06.160- 10:13.620* :  I'm really scared and I cannot continue my education and here I don't even feel safe being here
*10:13.620- 10:19.500* :  inside my house because every single time I look at the video and put police's cars arrive and
*10:19.500- 10:24.540* :  goes and we feel scared that they're going to come and capture us and all the other people they did.
*10:24.560- 10:28.420* :  This isn't the first time that this has happened to you because you went through this in Afghanistan
*10:28.420- 10:35.660* :  as well, didn't you? Yes yes this isn't the first time but it hasn't been this worst and I feel
*10:35.660- 10:42.580* :  I don't feel safe here inside my home either. And you said Sara about your education which
*10:42.580- 10:46.960* :  obviously would have been difficult in Afghanistan as well but you you can't you can't even study
*10:46.960- 10:52.220* :  in Pakistan now because because of the fear that you'll be be taken. I could not even
*10:52.220- 10:57.020* :  study here because if I go to school they'll capture it be like the other people did it and they
*10:57.020- 11:01.500* :  don't allow a lot of ponds admissions in here because they don't have valid visas and stuff
*11:01.980- 11:07.860* :  and because of that I cannot even continue my education. I cannot even get out of my house
*11:07.860- 11:12.840* :  that's really terrifying. I couldn't even go to my rooftop to look out because I'm too scared to
*11:12.840- 11:19.100* :  face the situation we're going through. Is this something that's coming only from the authorities?
*11:19.140- 11:26.300* :  How do ordinary Pakistanis treat you? They don't treat us that well either. Yeah they treat us like
*11:26.300- 11:33.040* :  we're something of like different they treat us because of very different culture and stuff.
*11:33.500- 11:40.340* :  That report was by Anna Foster. The brutal siege of Maruipol saw the deaths of more than 20,000
*11:40.340- 11:46.960* :  Ukrainians between February and May of last year and defined the brutality of the war. The southern
*11:46.960- 11:51.980* :  port city remains under Russian occupation and during the siege almost all reporters fled
*11:51.980- 11:57.360* :  Maruipol except one team of local journalists working for the associated press who stayed there
*11:57.360- 12:02.860* :  for three weeks. For most of that time theirs was the only news footage shot and broadcast
*12:02.860- 12:07.560* :  bringing to the world's attention some of the most harrowing images of the conflict so far
*12:08.020- 12:13.520* :  such as the bombing of the city's maternity hospital. Their daily dispatches have been turned
*12:13.520- 12:20.020* :  into a film 20 days in Maruipol. It's been released in the UK tomorrow and is Ukraine's entry for
*12:20.020- 12:27.480* :  the Oscars. Nikola Stambridge spoke to the filmmaker. The hospital is surrounded.
*12:27.880- 12:36.400* :  Ukrainian associated press reporter Mr. Slav Chernov, dozens of doctors, hundreds of patients and us.
*12:37.300- 12:43.000* :  Russian tanks turn their cannons towards the hospital where he's trapped with his cameraman and producer.
*12:44.000- 12:48.740* :  I have no illusions about what will happen to us if we are caught.
*12:49.600- 12:56.020* :  Carrying 30 hours of film capturing the siege of Maruipol, having only been able to file 30 minutes
*12:56.020- 13:00.080* :  of footage during their time in the city they turn the rest into the harrowing,
*13:00.080- 13:08.800* :  ward-winning documentary 20 days in Maruipol. We agreed we will take this risk. It's very important
*13:08.840- 13:16.360* :  personally and for a history of Ukraine as well. Devastating every day is more and more and more
*13:16.360- 13:20.880* :  people died in front of us. More and more bombs were falling on the city.
*13:20.880- 13:26.220* :  Air strikes on the southern city of Maruipol destroyed a children's and maternity hospital.
*13:26.420- 13:32.360* :  For once the aftermath of the bombing near the city's maternity hospital was filmed for the world to see.
*13:33.920- 13:40.160* :  We worked as long as we could and then we used an opportunity to leave. We were saved by a local
*13:40.160- 13:45.740* :  policeman. We meet Vladimir, the police officer who helps you at great cost to himself and his
*13:45.740- 13:51.940* :  family because he hopes your footage will change the course of the war. Our people needs help from
*13:51.940- 13:59.880* :  international society. Please help me open. Unfortunately I'm a long time already disillusioned
*13:59.880- 14:10.560* :  in hoping that journalism can change a lot except informing people. My hope is that if the footage
*14:10.560- 14:17.180* :  was used to negotiate the green corridor and it was if the footage and the photos helped
*14:17.180- 14:23.680* :  for families to find their loved ones that's already a lot. Do you know what is happening in
*14:23.960- 14:28.500* :  Maruipol now? We are in contact with some people inside Maruipol but they are afraid
*14:29.240- 14:34.960* :  to talk to anyone. Too many examples of what happens to people who are pro-Ukrainian and occupied
*14:34.960- 14:40.860* :  territories. All the evidences of potential war crimes are being erased right now. As
*14:41.720- 14:46.760* :  longer Maruipol is under occupation, less chance there is for investigations.
*14:48.480- 14:53.320* :  The Russians say they aren't targeting civilians. This is 18-month-old krill.
*14:55.200- 15:03.800* :  Medics try to save the boy. They cannot. Why do you use music in the film which can heighten
*15:03.800- 15:12.420* :  tension even further than perhaps is necessary with this subject? The main idea was how to transfer
*15:12.420- 15:21.440* :  viewer into this state of mind. How is it to be trapped? People who were buried on the rubble who
*15:21.440- 15:27.860* :  were just burned in their houses. That's what we tried to bring in with the music, those voices
*15:28.520- 15:38.580* :  of lives that are lost. As we drive away, I keep thinking about all the people who
*15:38.580- 15:47.500* :  stretch these who remain unknown. I will see my daughters and I can only hope that these people
*15:47.500- 15:54.020* :  survive and will be with their families too. In the film you say that you have no illusions about
*15:54.020- 15:59.680* :  what would happen to you if you're caught. Do you sometimes have to justify what you do with
*15:59.680- 16:05.500* :  your family and your young children? Is it fair on them? No, I definitely don't need to justify
*16:05.500- 16:12.580* :  anything. We just have to get through this in a way that when we look back we can say we
*16:12.960- 16:18.680* :  didn't just survive but we also did something good to people that are around us.
*16:19.340- 16:25.340* :  And you're still there now? Very, very, very close to the front line. However we try, how big the work
*16:25.360- 16:31.740* :  is, it's still not enough to show the scale of suffering and destruction and the struggle
*16:32.740- 16:38.640* :  and hope at the same time. So it's only by continuing this work. We can only try,
*16:38.640- 16:46.020* :  not succeed, but try to show as much as possible. Yesterday I told one of the officers who
*16:46.020- 16:54.060* :  extracted us from the hospital. Thank you for saving us. He said thank you for telling the story of
*16:54.060- 17:05.460* :  this city. Nicholas Stambridge reporting. Coming up in a couple of minutes, what has you
*17:05.460- 17:11.440* :  gained as opposition leader Bobby Wein been detained at the airport? And the surface is the
*17:11.440- 17:16.420* :  actual surface that people would have been walking on 600 years ago. A Shakespearean discovery.
*17:16.760- 17:19.220* :  Have they found a stage where the bard wants acted?
*17:27.720- 17:32.860* :  Most weight loss programs are short-term fixes, but managing your weight needs a long-term
*17:33.420- 17:38.620* :  solution. And that's what makes NUME different. NUME uses science and personalization to help

*18:01.020- 18:05.660* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*18:05.940- 18:11.820* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed like I had never seen
*18:11.820- 18:17.640* :  anything like this. At the height of Abercrombie and Fitsha's success. This was me being carefully
*18:17.640- 18:23.780* :  manipulated. Being lied to, tricked, and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that
*18:23.780- 18:31.780* :  would take me into a world of money, sex, and power. This is world of secrets. Season one,
*18:32.160- 18:35.720* :  the Abercrombie guys. Listen wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:40.960- 18:46.520* :  Now, you don't read my books for the plots. The words of the Norwegian writer,
*18:46.520- 18:52.780* :  Yuan Fossa, who has in their past few hours been named the winner of this year's Nobel Prize
*18:52.780- 18:57.800* :  for Literature. The 64-year-old's works have been translated into more than 40 languages.
*18:57.800- 19:02.340* :  The chairman of the Nobel Committee, Anders Olson, said Fossa's first plate,
*19:02.340- 19:07.680* :  someone is going to come, his international breakthrough in 1998, reflected the writer's
*19:07.680- 19:15.340* :  distinctiveness. Even in this early piece, with its themes and a fearful anticipation and crippling
*19:15.340- 19:25.920* :  jealousy, Fossa's singularity is fully evident. In his radical reduction of language and dramatic
*19:25.920- 19:35.600* :  action, he exposes human anxiety and equivalence at its core. I got more details from the arts
*19:35.600- 19:41.880* :  journalist Vincent Dowd. Well, as he said, Norwegian writer, age 64, lives now partly in Norway and
*19:41.880- 19:48.300* :  partly in Austria. He's definitely a man of letters in the European tradition novels, poetry,
*19:48.300- 19:54.340* :  children of books, actually essays. I would say he's best known just about as a playwright,
*19:54.340- 19:59.060* :  especially in Scandinavia and in German-speaking countries. He's less well-known in the UK and in
*19:59.060- 20:03.700* :  the USA. That's definitely true. For instance, here in the UK, he's published by this war,
*20:03.740- 20:09.420* :  although excellent in print, Fitzgerald, though. So he's not part of the mass market thus far.
*20:09.940- 20:14.960* :  But Fossa is best known, he's probably the best known literary talent Norway has produced in
*20:14.960- 20:21.160* :  recent years, but that's terribly snobbishly to emit Jonesbo. He's counterpart much further up
*20:21.160- 20:25.860* :  the bestseller list internationally. There is a very, very long list of Fossa publications,
*20:25.860- 20:32.100* :  at least 30 plays and that's without all the prose and poetry. And we heard from Anders Olsen
*20:32.100- 20:37.200* :  there roughly wide being chosen, reducing human emotions. Why do you think he was chosen?
*20:37.760- 20:41.860* :  Well, the Nobel Prize people, as I'm sure you know, try to come up each year with an epithet
*20:42.220- 20:48.220* :  to say why the winner gets the roughly million dollar prize, 11 million Swedish Kroner.
*20:48.560- 20:53.580* :  He's been tipped to get his prize the quite some time. They said his innovative plays and poems
*20:53.580- 21:00.500* :  give voice to the unsourable. Now, make of that what you will. And Vincent, which books and
*21:00.500- 21:05.280* :  works of his should we read? Well, we should say he's won a very large number of literary prizes,
*21:05.280- 21:10.600* :  such as the Ibsen Prize in 2010 and the European Prize for Literature. So for serious readers,
*21:10.600- 21:15.820* :  he's known for novels such as Boat House and his mysterious times menacing plays,
*21:16.760- 21:23.100* :  which has been seen pretty widely in Europe. He is often compared almost inevitably to be
*21:23.100- 21:29.100* :  absolutely honest with Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. So by some reckoning, he's the most
*21:29.100- 21:35.900* :  performed playwright in Europe. He writes about our failure to communicate about the inadequacy
*21:35.900- 21:42.740* :  of human relationships. So he's never going to be, it's true, adapted for a Broadway musical or
*21:42.740- 21:48.220* :  a big West End show, but that's a good thing. He says the universe of his play is created from zero.
*21:48.220- 21:53.020* :  I prefer not to know anything before I start. I don't know exactly what I'm listening for,
*21:53.020- 21:59.740* :  but I try to listen anyway. A very literary playwright, very literary author of novels,
*21:59.740- 22:05.620* :  but someone who will be read more around the world because of today's prize. Vincent Doubt.
*22:06.520- 22:12.020* :  In Uganda, the main opposition party says its leader, Bobby Wein, was picked up by police on
*22:12.020- 22:16.420* :  returning to the country from a trip abroad. The National Unity Party says the singleton
*22:16.420- 22:22.560* :  politician was seized just moments after landing at a tabby international airport on Thursday morning.
*22:23.120- 22:25.380* :  The video has been widely shared on social media.
*22:36.280- 22:41.080* :  It appears to show a group of non-uniform security guards grabbing the form of presidential
*22:41.080- 22:47.320* :  contender as soon as he disembarks before shoving him into a waiting van, which then sped off into
*22:47.320- 22:53.400* :  the distance. Bobby Wein supporters had planned to hold a rally and accompany him to his home north
*22:53.400- 22:58.760* :  of the capital campala, but police had said such gatherings were illegal. Well, Ross is our
*22:58.760- 23:04.680* :  Africa regional editor. Well, it seems that the authorities in Uganda were worried that there
*23:04.680- 23:10.880* :  was going to be a huge gathering of Bobby Wein supporters from the airport in and tabby
*23:11.860- 23:19.600* :  into campala. There have been occasions in the past when opposition politicians have returned
*23:19.600- 23:29.500* :  from abroad and that's prompted huge crowds together. It clearly suits the government and the
*23:29.500- 23:35.740* :  authorities in Uganda for there not to be a big opposition gathering. So he was whisked away
*23:35.740- 23:40.580* :  and the police have denied that there was an arrest as alleged by the opposition and say
*23:40.580- 23:46.480* :  he was merely successfully escorted to his home. That's the language that the police use.
*23:47.680- 23:52.560* :  But the, as you say, the opposition party calls it an arrest and clearly he was taken
*23:53.160- 24:00.860* :  against his will ahead of the landing back in the country. There was a plan for this sort of
*24:00.860- 24:06.880* :  procession and we understand there will be opposition rallies, but this is probably a sign yet
*24:06.880- 24:15.380* :  again of the authorities in Uganda not wanting there to be any kind of headwind and gathering
*24:15.380- 24:21.660* :  of the opposition to have big rallies. And Bobby Wein says that he's been arrested and persecuted
*24:21.660- 24:26.680* :  on spurious charges many times at the bar. He alleges physical assault during some of those
*24:26.680- 24:32.420* :  detentions. The background to this is that he represents a serious threat to the ruling party.
*24:33.300- 24:38.400* :  Well, that's right. He, you know, is it roughly half the age of President
*24:38.400- 24:46.020* :  Misevone who's not far off 80 now and people are looking towards the next election in 2026 and
*24:46.020- 24:51.960* :  certainly with a very youthful population in Uganda, Bobby Wein has a considerable support,
*24:51.960- 24:58.040* :  especially in urban areas. And that is somewhat of a threat to President Misevone who's been
*24:58.040- 25:04.000* :  in power now since 1986. But it's not just Bobby Wein. You go back and look at former opposition
*25:04.000- 25:10.400* :  leaders like Kieser-Besage, who many people would say was, you know, fairly brave throughout
*25:10.400- 25:16.400* :  all the assaults and arrests he went through. And Bobby Wein has kind of taken on that role now
*25:16.400- 25:22.180* :  of being the main opposition person. And that means you get arrested often. He's been charged with
*25:22.180- 25:27.280* :  all kinds of crimes, including treason. And there have been in the past very violent clashes
*25:27.280- 25:33.200* :  between opposition supporters and the security forces. There are people in Uganda, though, who say
*25:33.200- 25:39.380* :  that, you know, these planned rallies and processions that block the traffic, it does kind of
*25:39.380- 25:47.060* :  disrupt the normal everyday life. And some people do get a bit tired of these clashes between
*25:47.060- 25:51.080* :  the opposition and the police that sort of disrupt normal life. Will Ross.
*25:52.220- 25:56.620* :  India is the host of this year's Cricket World Cup, which has just gone underway.
*25:56.620- 26:01.120* :  The love of the sport, of course, runs deep in India, from big cities to small towns,
*26:01.120- 26:06.700* :  and in one rural village. An enthusiastic girls cricket team is breaking traditions and dreaming
*26:06.780- 26:10.500* :  big. Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein reports from Punjab.
*26:12.140- 26:14.020* :  The pure joy of cricket.
*26:19.400- 26:25.100* :  These players are part of the Gulab Cricket Academy. All girls all from neighboring villages
*26:25.380- 26:32.460* :  all heart. In rural communities, girls don't usually get these kinds of opportunities.
*26:38.340- 26:42.820* :  They are the lucky ones playing on a cricket pitch in the heart of harm country.
*26:45.540- 26:49.340* :  Her similar board has been on the team since it started four years ago.
*26:50.100- 26:53.020* :  She plays with passion and dreams of making it big.
*26:57.980- 27:03.880* :  When we are playing a match, I feel like I am wearing a Josie Fatime India. When I play,
*27:03.880- 27:09.520* :  I feel only one thing that I am not playing for India now, but I will play for India's cricket
*27:09.520- 27:17.340* :  team someday. There's a lot more happening here than just girls playing cricket.
*27:17.920- 27:22.820* :  They're also breaking with tradition. They're building confidence both on and off the pitch,
*27:23.200- 27:27.240* :  and they're also changing people's mindsets in terms of what girls can do.
*27:28.040- 27:29.260* :  You don't have to worry about it.
*27:29.980- 27:35.220* :  Gulab Singh shared that he wanted to be a professional cricketer, but lacked opportunity and resources.
*27:35.940- 27:40.260* :  So he started this plucky little team, free of cost, to encourage these girls,
*27:40.640- 27:43.380* :  to dream beyond the boundaries of their rural communities.
*27:47.680- 27:52.060* :  Mostly in Indian villages, girls are not permitted to go outside their homes.
*27:52.700- 27:56.100* :  Now we are also able to have matches between girls and boys.
*27:56.920- 28:02.600* :  That makes them proud of themselves. Now they're able to tell their parents that I can do it.
*28:06.600- 28:12.260* :  For a few hours a day, they are free from societal pressures and able to just be kids.
*28:17.460- 28:18.120* :  Samira Hussain
*28:19.140- 28:23.280* :  Now you can be pretty sure that right now there is someone somewhere performing a Shakespeare
*28:23.280- 28:29.240* :  play on stage. But how about acting on the very stage where the Bard himself once acted?
*28:29.960- 28:34.500* :  Quite a prospect. And experts believe they found the only such place that still exists.
*28:35.280- 28:40.080* :  Colin Patterson went to St George's Guildhall Theatre in Eastern England to take a look.
*28:41.740- 28:44.780* :  Top of the massive floorboards.
*28:45.120- 28:50.700* :  Historical buildings expert Dr Jonathan Green looking through an improvised trap door in the Guildhall's
*28:50.700- 28:55.340* :  auditorium at what the theatre believes is a stage on which Shakespeare acted.
*28:55.480- 29:00.420* :  This surface is the actual surface that people would have been walking on 600 years ago.
*29:00.700- 29:07.640* :  And what really interesting is this floor was here in 1592 when we think Shakespeare is performing in
*29:07.740- 29:14.420* :  Kingsland. Using tree ring dating he worked out these floorboards were made between 1417 and 1430
*29:14.420- 29:20.060* :  and a barat account book shows that Shakespeare's acting company came to town when theatres and London
*29:20.060- 29:26.500* :  were shot due to the plague. Shakespeare famously wrote, all the worlds of stage, experts say it's
*29:26.500- 29:31.500* :  very likely he did appear on this one. Our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson.
*29:33.920- 29:37.840* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.

*30:12.420- 30:18.740* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed like I'd never seen anything
*30:18.940- 30:24.880* :  like this. At the height of Abercrombie and Fitzgera's success. This was me being carefully manipulated.
*30:24.880- 30:31.400* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that would take me into a
*30:31.400- 30:39.780* :  world of money, sex and power. This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
