*00:16.220- 00:16.940* :  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds.
*00:16.940- 00:20.900* :  At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
*00:21.140- 00:23.560* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.900- 00:28.020* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:28.020- 00:31.280* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*00:31.540- 00:36.540* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
*00:36.540- 00:39.520* :  Give it a try at MintMobile.com-switch.
*00:39.820- 00:42.800* :  New activation and upfront payment for three month plan required, taxes and fees extra.
*00:42.920- 00:45.360* :  Additional restrictions apply, cementmobile.com for full terms.
*00:49.080- 00:55.260* :  This is the third Global News Podcast special edition on Israel and Gaza from the BBC World Service.
*00:58.420- 01:02.100* :  I'm Jackie Leonard in London and we are once again getting together with our colleagues
*01:02.100- 01:06.840* :  from the conflict podcast to put your questions to our expert correspondence.
*01:06.840- 01:12.860* :  We're recording this podcast at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 27th of October.
*01:13.300- 01:18.180* :  Joining us from Jerusalem is the BBC's Chief International Correspondent, Lee Stusset.
*01:18.660- 01:22.940* :  And here in the studio with me in London is Frank Gardner, our security correspondent.
*01:23.700- 01:28.880* :  And you, our audience, have sent us a lot of questions to pick apart, so let's get started.
*01:33.160- 01:37.920* :  At the point we are recording this on Friday, the aid situation is desperate.
*01:38.300- 01:43.000* :  You will remember that Israel ordered a complete siege of Gaza on October the 9th
*01:43.320- 01:46.200* :  in response to the Hamas attacks of October the 7th.
*01:46.560- 01:50.780* :  And almost a week ago some aid trucks started crossing into Gaza from Egypt.
*01:51.840- 01:54.900* :  Even then though, there were far fewer than had been getting in before
*01:54.900- 01:59.260* :  and aid agencies have described it as a drop in the ocean of what's needed.
*01:59.800- 02:02.360* :  So on the subject of aid, here's our first question.
*02:03.240- 02:07.660* :  This is Camille from Australia and my question is about all the aid trucks.
*02:08.400- 02:11.360* :  Because I know just before this conflict started,
*02:11.820- 02:15.500* :  there was a lot of discussion about US funding and aid to Ukraine.
*02:16.360- 02:19.360* :  And now there's a lot of trucks amassed at the Egypt border.
*02:19.860- 02:23.240* :  Was this aid that was already destined to go into Gaza?
*02:23.240- 02:27.220* :  Because I've also heard reports that there was aid going in already, but this is not as much as now.
*02:27.960- 02:32.200* :  So just a note on how this maneuvering had happened if one affects the other.
*02:33.160- 02:34.780* :  So, Lee, if you could start with that one.
*02:35.460- 02:37.440* :  Yes, thank you very much for the question.
*02:37.440- 02:38.320* :  It's very important.
*02:38.420- 02:44.360* :  The UN and other agencies tell us that before this war erupted between Israel and Gaza,
*02:44.960- 02:51.320* :  that as many as 500 trucks a day were getting in to Gaza with all kinds of goods.
*02:51.980- 02:54.580* :  And that includes commercial supplies as well.
*02:54.580- 02:59.760* :  The United Nations on this old was sometimes 100 trucks a day, sometimes 200 trucks a day.
*03:00.380- 03:05.600* :  If you compare that to now, since the trucks started rolling across the border
*03:06.000- 03:09.240* :  from Egypt through the Rafa crossing into southern Gaza,
*03:09.480- 03:14.540* :  there was only about, at the time that I'm speaking, about 74 trucks,
*03:15.140- 03:20.160* :  which is over the past few weeks since this siege was imposed by Israel.
*03:20.160- 03:26.240* :  So that is why the UN says it is a drop in an ocean of needs.
*03:26.240- 03:30.940* :  And it doesn't include fuel, which we're hearing from the United Nations today,
*03:30.980- 03:38.460* :  means that the aid operations they're able to still maintain in the Gaza strip are collapsing.
*03:39.300- 03:43.740* :  And Greg in the US also draws comparisons with Ukraine.
*03:43.740- 03:45.100* :  This one is for you, Frank.
*03:45.940- 03:48.140* :  My name is Greg and I live in Logan, Utah.
*03:49.040- 03:52.500* :  My question has to do with European countries' response to war
*03:52.500- 03:54.700* :  versus the Middle Eastern countries' response.
*03:55.740- 03:59.860* :  When war broke out in Ukraine, the European countries opened their arms
*03:59.860- 04:02.140* :  to the women and children who needed safety.
*04:02.820- 04:06.520* :  Why are the countries in the Middle East not doing the same for the women and children
*04:06.520- 04:08.780* :  in Gaza who are in a similar situation?
*04:09.560- 04:14.080* :  And why is this question not being asked by both media and by the US
*04:14.080- 04:15.920* :  in communication with these countries?
*04:16.820- 04:19.800* :  The emphasis is on getting humanitarian aid into Gaza,
*04:20.320- 04:22.280* :  but that seems like a very poor solution.
*04:22.880- 04:26.900* :  It seems like the humanitarian thing to do would be to get the women and children
*04:26.900- 04:31.360* :  out of Gaza and into a safe location similar to what took place in Europe.
*04:32.160- 04:32.600* :  Thank you.
*04:33.840- 04:35.100* :  Well, Greg, thank you for your question.
*04:35.100- 04:36.360* :  There are several answers to this.
*04:36.360- 04:41.340* :  The first is that in terms of human transit, human passage,
*04:42.060- 04:44.420* :  Gaza is effectively sealed off in the outside world.
*04:45.320- 04:49.760* :  Israel, which controls Gaza's borders on three out of four borders
*04:49.760- 04:52.280* :  and Egypt controls the last one, between the two of them,
*04:53.880- 04:56.800* :  there is no passage of people allowed in or out.
*04:57.520- 05:03.000* :  The second reason is that Arab countries and Palestinians
*05:03.820- 05:08.200* :  are very wary of what's called a repetition of the Nuckba,
*05:08.200- 05:10.440* :  the catastrophe of 1948.
*05:11.060- 05:14.720* :  That's what the Palestinians refer to the mass displacement
*05:14.720- 05:17.460* :  of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and their families
*05:18.040- 05:20.760* :  out of areas that they'd lived in for in some cases centuries
*05:21.440- 05:23.520* :  to make way for the new state of Israel.
*05:23.520- 05:26.800* :  And they ended up as refugees in neighboring countries
*05:26.800- 05:29.140* :  like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
*05:29.860- 05:31.960* :  And Egypt, there's a third reason here,
*05:31.960- 05:34.820* :  is that Egypt does not want to lie
*05:34.820- 05:36.980* :  in large numbers of Palestinians,
*05:36.980- 05:41.560* :  which could well include Hamas fighters into Northern Sinai,
*05:41.560- 05:43.280* :  which joins on with Gaza.
*05:43.880- 05:46.580* :  Why? Because that's already a pretty precarious area.
*05:46.580- 05:50.700* :  There's been a ISIS-led insurgency there for some years.
*05:51.080- 05:54.460* :  There've been some horrific attacks on Bedouin
*05:54.900- 05:56.860* :  and on Egyptian government soldiers.
*05:57.440- 06:00.160* :  They don't want to see that area unsettled any further.
*06:00.160- 06:05.520* :  So Egypt is wary of the mass transfer of Palestinians.
*06:05.520- 06:08.940* :  But primarily, it's that Arab countries fear
*06:09.520- 06:12.060* :  that if they moved out of those out of Gaza,
*06:12.560- 06:13.700* :  they'd never be allowed back in.
*06:14.180- 06:16.280* :  And that Israel would simply recolonize it.
*06:17.280- 06:19.960* :  Now, we've talked a bit before about the US response
*06:19.960- 06:22.540* :  towards going on. It has pledged its unwavering support
*06:22.540- 06:25.020* :  to Israel and backed that up with military aid.
*06:25.340- 06:28.180* :  Here's a question on Washington's military strategy.
*06:28.960- 06:31.700* :  My name is Jonathan Paulman from Dallas, Texas.
*06:32.280- 06:34.320* :  What if the US deterrence measures aren't working?
*06:34.520- 06:36.680* :  We've seen that they have moved carriers
*06:36.680- 06:40.000* :  from the Eastern Mediterranean into the Middle East
*06:40.260- 06:42.340* :  as a deterrence, yet threats and violence,
*06:42.340- 06:46.260* :  they're rising even with F-16s, F-15s, and B-52s
*06:46.260- 06:47.100* :  flying into the region.
*06:48.060- 06:49.440* :  What if this deterrence doesn't work?
*06:49.640- 06:51.800* :  What are the next steps the US can take rationally
*06:52.260- 06:52.880* :  in this conflict?
*06:54.160- 06:54.400* :  Frank?
*06:55.960- 06:58.060* :  OK, so we're firing here, particularly.
*06:58.060- 07:02.440* :  I think you're referring to the presence of a massive US naval
*07:02.440- 07:04.980* :  and air force just offshore in the Eastern Mediterranean.
*07:06.060- 07:10.640* :  That was deployed there led by the USS Dwighty Eisenhower
*07:11.500- 07:14.800* :  aircraft carrier as an immediate response
*07:14.800- 07:17.920* :  by the US Department of Defense to the attacks of October
*07:17.920- 07:18.460* :  the 7th.
*07:18.520- 07:21.060* :  The US said to Israel, we've got your back.
*07:21.840- 07:25.420* :  And that's been joined by a second carrier group.
*07:25.820- 07:28.400* :  It's meant to be a deterrence primarily to Hezbollah
*07:29.060- 07:32.180* :  in Lebanon and by extension to Iran to basically say,
*07:32.180- 07:36.060* :  look, don't think that while Israel is preoccupied
*07:36.060- 07:38.880* :  fighting a war in Gaza, you can take advantage of that
*07:38.880- 07:41.740* :  and start a second front on the Lebanese border,
*07:42.260- 07:45.560* :  because if you do and you start a major war there,
*07:46.000- 07:49.300* :  then we, the United States, will help Israel out.
*07:49.560- 07:52.320* :  And the implication is, although they've not said so specifically,
*07:52.960- 07:56.740* :  the implication is that the US would deploy that massive air
*07:56.740- 07:59.140* :  power and missile power with all these cruise missiles
*07:59.140- 08:02.440* :  and so on to devastate Hezbollah's positions in southern Lebanon.
*08:02.440- 08:05.160* :  It would also cause a lot of damage in Lebanon itself.
*08:05.800- 08:08.100* :  So that, I think, is causing Hezbollah second thoughts
*08:08.100- 08:11.020* :  about whether they really want to get involved in this.
*08:11.020- 08:15.180* :  They are skirmishing with the Israeli forces on that northern border.
*08:15.180- 08:17.260* :  There are constant exchanges of fire each day.
*08:17.780- 08:18.660* :  It's fairly low level.
*08:18.660- 08:21.980* :  It's nothing like the intensity of the 2006 war
*08:21.980- 08:24.260* :  that Hezbollah fought with Israel,
*08:24.260- 08:28.060* :  which ended it inconclusively with neither side winning, ready.
*08:29.000- 08:31.140* :  And you mentioned the Iran's role.
*08:31.140- 08:32.720* :  That brings us to this question.
*08:33.260- 08:34.780* :  My name is Jimmy Vlembera.
*08:35.320- 08:38.940* :  I live in Washington, DC, but I'm from the Democratic
*08:38.940- 08:40.240* :  public of Congo.
*08:40.940- 08:45.520* :  My question is that when someone does a quick search on Hamas
*08:45.800- 08:48.860* :  online, one of the first things that comes up
*08:49.720- 08:52.140* :  is that Hamas is a Sunni organization.
*08:52.900- 08:55.840* :  However, for the last three weeks or so,
*08:56.700- 09:00.180* :  news coverage from many news organizations
*09:01.240- 09:04.500* :  has highlighted that Hamas gets funding
*09:04.500- 09:07.200* :  and are the type of support from Iran.
*09:08.300- 09:13.220* :  Now, how did the Shia regime in Iran become a sponsor
*09:13.940- 09:15.540* :  of a Sunni organization?
*09:16.160- 09:18.060* :  And please, we'll turn to you first with that one.
*09:18.380- 09:18.960* :  Good question.
*09:19.800- 09:23.480* :  Iran's relationship with Hezbollah and Lebanon
*09:24.040- 09:26.600* :  with Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza,
*09:26.600- 09:30.860* :  with the Houthis in Yemen, with proxies and militias in Iraq
*09:31.600- 09:35.220* :  and in Syria is part of what Iran would say
*09:35.220- 09:37.880* :  an axis of resistance, resistance groups
*09:37.880- 09:41.860* :  who are willing to take on the might of the United States
*09:41.860- 09:43.240* :  of imperial forces.
*09:43.980- 09:45.200* :  And this does market change.
*09:45.200- 09:48.860* :  If you go back to, for example, the establishment of Hezbollah
*09:48.860- 09:51.380* :  in Lebanon, Hezbollah means party of God.
*09:51.380- 09:55.720* :  It was established in 1982 in the midst of the Israeli invasion
*09:55.820- 09:58.640* :  of Lebanon, which went right into Beirut.
*09:59.140- 10:00.920* :  And when it was established, it was established
*10:00.920- 10:05.420* :  by Lebanese clerics who very much tried to model
*10:05.560- 10:09.080* :  Hezbollah on Iran, on Iran's Islamic system.
*10:09.540- 10:13.440* :  That relationship is absolutely symbiotic relationship,
*10:14.060- 10:20.200* :  very, very important coordination between these two groups.
*10:20.860- 10:23.860* :  But in recent years, as so many Arab states moved away
*10:23.860- 10:28.100* :  from the Palestinian file, Iran had been providing support
*10:28.100- 10:29.800* :  for Islamic Jihad.
*10:30.180- 10:33.360* :  But it also started providing more support for Hamas
*10:33.360- 10:35.960* :  because it was standing up to Israel
*10:35.960- 10:40.520* :  and Iran saw an opportunity that it could have an ally in Gaza
*10:41.120- 10:43.280* :  in its fight against the Jewish state.
*10:43.840- 10:47.320* :  So this is why we, I think this is why it has reached the point
*10:47.320- 10:50.740* :  in which it is now where Iran seems to have a hand in,
*10:51.120- 10:53.100* :  not just with the Shia militias,
*10:53.100- 10:56.360* :  with which it has very, very, very strong ties
*10:56.360- 10:58.780* :  for religious, historical, and other reasons,
*10:58.780- 11:01.320* :  but also Sunni groups like Hamas.
*11:01.320- 11:04.320* :  And I think we should also mention that one of Hamas's other backers,
*11:04.360- 11:07.420* :  or at least where many of the Hamas political leaders are based,
*11:07.420- 11:09.460* :  is the Gulf state of Qatar.
*11:09.460- 11:13.020* :  And Qatar also has very strong ties with Iran.
*11:13.740- 11:15.100* :  Sorry, do you want to chip in that?
*11:15.100- 11:17.280* :  Yeah, I mean, I think the big takeaway from this really
*11:17.280- 11:20.600* :  is that land trumps religion when it comes to this.
*11:21.060- 11:24.540* :  Because people have essentially put aside the differences
*11:24.540- 11:28.040* :  between the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam.
*11:28.820- 11:31.120* :  Because for Iran and for Hamas,
*11:31.120- 11:32.760* :  the most important thing in their view
*11:33.140- 11:35.980* :  is what they would call the liberation of the land of Palestine.
*11:35.980- 11:38.820* :  So remember that neither of those two, neither Iran,
*11:38.820- 11:42.520* :  nor Hamas except the right of Israel to even exist,
*11:43.100- 11:46.240* :  at all, as a state, let alone the West Bank and so on.
*11:46.860- 11:49.680* :  There are a number of Sunni rulers, governments,
*11:49.740- 11:52.000* :  in the region who don't like Hamas.
*11:52.420- 11:56.480* :  So Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, they don't like Hamas,
*11:56.480- 11:58.760* :  because Hamas, yes, it's Sunni,
*11:59.180- 12:01.820* :  but it's tied to what's called political Islam.
*12:02.480- 12:04.660* :  It has links to something called the Muslim Brotherhood.
*12:05.080- 12:07.080* :  In Egypt, the government there overthrew
*12:07.480- 12:08.660* :  the Muslim Brotherhood President,
*12:08.660- 12:11.220* :  the elected Muslim Brotherhood President of Muhammad Mursi,
*12:11.220- 12:16.240* :  10 years ago, and the UAE is extremely suspicious
*12:16.840- 12:18.860* :  that political Islam and the Muslim Brotherhood
*12:18.860- 12:22.620* :  represent an existential threat to their way of ruling
*12:22.620- 12:24.700* :  through tribal, dynastic shakes,
*12:24.700- 12:27.700* :  handing on power from father to son and so on.
*12:28.060- 12:31.020* :  And shifting the focus of questions from Iran,
*12:31.020- 12:33.380* :  what about its ally, Russia?
*12:33.660- 12:35.920* :  We've got a couple of listeners with similar questions.
*12:36.720- 12:38.260* :  This is Jared, living in Berlin.
*12:39.080- 12:43.420* :  My question is, what role has Russia played in this conflict?
*12:43.940- 12:46.560* :  Russia has long been a supporter of the Palestinian movement,
*12:46.560- 12:48.800* :  and under the Soviet Union provided support
*12:48.800- 12:53.000* :  during the wars of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War.
*12:53.760- 12:56.020* :  Given that Russia has formed close with the Iran,
*12:56.060- 12:58.500* :  and Iran is the main supporter of Hamas.
*12:58.960- 12:59.680* :  Is there a connection?
*13:00.960- 13:03.360* :  Hi, my name is Risk from the Blue Mountains in Australia.
*13:04.240- 13:06.000* :  Would it be a far-fetched idea to think
*13:06.000- 13:07.480* :  that Russia would get Iran?
*13:07.480- 13:10.620* :  It's staunch ally to stoke the Middle East
*13:10.620- 13:13.280* :  seen by having them support Hamas in planning
*13:13.280- 13:15.380* :  and executing the barrage of the AXA.
*13:16.160- 13:19.660* :  In order to drain the US and the West
*13:19.880- 13:21.640* :  by getting them involved in another war
*13:21.640- 13:23.840* :  and spend billions on two different fronts.
*13:24.780- 13:27.440* :  And be, distract the world from the Ukraine war
*13:27.640- 13:29.480* :  that has been going on for almost two years.
*13:30.060- 13:30.260* :  Frank.
*13:31.000- 13:33.160* :  OK, these are really interesting and good questions.
*13:33.160- 13:33.900* :  Thank you, big TV.
*13:35.560- 13:37.620* :  I think it would be unfair to say that Russia had
*13:37.620- 13:40.400* :  a hand in the October 7th raid by Hamas
*13:40.400- 13:41.320* :  into southern Israel.
*13:41.920- 13:43.760* :  But it has certainly benefited from it.
*13:43.760- 13:46.280* :  Because, as Rizik rightly points out,
*13:46.720- 13:49.620* :  it has proved a massive distraction from the Ukraine war,
*13:49.620- 13:51.520* :  which hasn't finished, is still ongoing.
*13:52.120- 13:54.520* :  Ukraine is still large parts of it are occupied
*13:54.520- 13:56.240* :  by Russian-invading troops.
*13:56.940- 13:59.860* :  And it's coming still under constant attack
*13:59.860- 14:02.480* :  from Russian drones, but it's just not on the news
*14:02.480- 14:04.420* :  because all the attention globally
*14:04.920- 14:07.560* :  is on the plate of those caught up
*14:07.560- 14:09.620* :  in this Israel-Hamas conflict.
*14:10.280- 14:12.160* :  Now, in the last couple of days,
*14:12.160- 14:14.060* :  there has been a meeting in Moscow
*14:14.860- 14:18.320* :  with Russian officials together with Iranian officials
*14:18.960- 14:19.920* :  and Hamas.
*14:21.420- 14:23.480* :  I don't think Russia will want to get involved in this,
*14:23.480- 14:24.920* :  but they are certainly saying,
*14:25.260- 14:27.200* :  well, all of this is America's fault
*14:27.200- 14:31.080* :  for being such a useless peace broker in the Middle East.
*14:31.520- 14:33.180* :  And America, I think, has largely,
*14:33.620- 14:35.660* :  up until now, lost interest in the Middle East.
*14:35.660- 14:38.660* :  It was even under the previous President Obama,
*14:38.660- 14:41.160* :  he was talking about pivoting to Asia
*14:41.600- 14:44.960* :  and certainly with a huge presidential election
*14:44.960- 14:46.740* :  coming up in about a year's time,
*14:47.380- 14:49.500* :  attention in the US is focusing or was focusing,
*14:49.500- 14:52.120* :  increasingly, on East Asia and China
*14:52.640- 14:54.420* :  and whether Taiwan was going to get invaded
*14:54.420- 14:56.740* :  and the South China's sea and so on.
*14:57.300- 15:00.920* :  And this, I think, will have temporarily refocus people
*15:00.920- 15:01.620* :  on the Middle East.
*15:02.080- 15:05.780* :  But Russia has become a very important figure in the Middle East.
*15:05.780- 15:08.080* :  It's embedded militarily in Syria
*15:08.740- 15:11.380* :  and it's now an important diplomatic player
*15:11.380- 15:13.720* :  in the region where it wasn't 10 years ago.
*15:14.340- 15:17.820* :  Now, as we record, Israel has not yet moved
*15:17.820- 15:20.060* :  its ground troops fully into Gaza.
*15:20.680- 15:22.180* :  Israeli air strikes are continuing,
*15:22.180- 15:24.540* :  large numbers of people are getting killed every day.
*15:25.080- 15:27.800* :  Meanwhile, four hostages have been freed by Hamas,
*15:27.800- 15:30.860* :  but Israel says more than 200 are still being held.
*15:31.420- 15:32.940* :  We got this email from a listener
*15:32.940- 15:35.560* :  who didn't want to be identified, so we voiced it up.
*15:36.060- 15:39.960* :  I am curious about what Hamas and other Palestinian groups
*15:39.960- 15:43.280* :  are doing at the moment, besides holding hostages.
*15:43.940- 15:46.120* :  Are they also bombing and fighting back?
*15:46.540- 15:48.840* :  Are many or any Israelis dying?
*15:49.700- 15:50.660* :  Lee, is this one's for you?
*15:51.120- 15:54.000* :  Well, I can certainly say that Hamas hasn't stopped
*15:54.000- 15:58.440* :  its firing rockets into Israel since this war began.
*15:58.440- 16:01.560* :  I've sent most of the first two weeks of this war
*16:01.560- 16:04.520* :  in southern Israel where the air raid sirens
*16:04.520- 16:08.720* :  went off constantly when we were in the southern community
*16:08.720- 16:11.780* :  of Stratless in a mile from the Gaza border
*16:11.780- 16:15.760* :  where on some days rockets kept landing very close to us.
*16:16.200- 16:18.060* :  And it was Hamas making the point
*16:18.060- 16:20.320* :  that for all of the non-stop bombardment
*16:20.800- 16:23.840* :  by Israeli war planes, they still had the capacity
*16:23.840- 16:26.480* :  and indeed the determination to keep firing
*16:26.480- 16:28.780* :  and just before we started recording today,
*16:28.780- 16:32.040* :  we heard that the air raid sirens were sounding
*16:32.040- 16:35.180* :  in the coastal city of Tel Aviv as well.
*16:35.900- 16:38.060* :  Now, of course, what we don't know is
*16:38.700- 16:41.720* :  where this vast network of Hamas, where are they now?
*16:41.720- 16:45.240* :  Are they taking refuge inside that network of tunnels?
*16:45.240- 16:47.220* :  Have some of them managed to escape?
*16:47.220- 16:50.020* :  One Hamas leading political figure has turned up
*16:50.020- 16:54.200* :  in the Lebanese capital Beirut, but from the beginning,
*16:54.200- 16:57.460* :  it's been said that in the same way that Hamas put
*16:57.860- 17:01.860* :  so much preparation, so much resources into this attack,
*17:01.860- 17:04.840* :  this really unprecedented and very brutal attack
*17:04.840- 17:06.900* :  against Israel on October the 7th,
*17:07.220- 17:10.480* :  it would know there would be an unprecedented retaliation
*17:10.480- 17:13.240* :  by Israel so that it would have made preparations
*17:13.300- 17:17.220* :  to fight back when Israel does, as is widely expected,
*17:17.720- 17:18.840* :  goes in on the ground.
*17:18.840- 17:22.340* :  So we just don't know how many missiles it has in store.
*17:22.340- 17:26.520* :  It has been firing many more missiles than it thought it had
*17:26.520- 17:30.240* :  and that it had fired in previous conflagrations with Israel,
*17:30.920- 17:33.200* :  but I think it's fair to say that even though we don't know
*17:33.200- 17:36.400* :  everything, what we do know is that they do still have
*17:36.760- 17:39.700* :  quite an arsenal, and Israel is now trying to destroy it.
*17:40.160- 17:42.480* :  Well, several listeners have written in on the subject
*17:42.480- 17:46.500* :  of accountability and Israel's alleged war crimes,
*17:46.900- 17:49.840* :  and I do need to point out here that of all the messages
*17:50.060- 17:51.640* :  that we received on this subject,
*17:51.640- 17:53.100* :  they were all about Israel.
*17:53.460- 17:55.620* :  This is a reflection of what listeners are discussing
*17:56.100- 17:57.920* :  rather than any bias from our end.
*17:58.520- 18:00.500* :  Two listeners with similar questions.
*18:01.440- 18:04.140* :  I am Sachin Narana, working as an English teacher.
*18:04.460- 18:05.340* :  I am from India.
*18:06.020- 18:09.600* :  My question is it justified to use disproportionate
*18:09.600- 18:12.120* :  four-segnest innocent civilian population
*18:12.640- 18:15.940* :  because of the presence of a few thousand militants
*18:16.200- 18:17.380* :  who are lurking among them.
*18:17.840- 18:20.020* :  And that is my question to the international community.
*18:21.000- 18:22.320* :  Hello, my name is Narana.
*18:22.320- 18:23.860* :  I'm calling from Japan.
*18:25.060- 18:30.600* :  There are a number of alleged war crimes by Israel,
*18:31.580- 18:33.460* :  including collective punishment,
*18:34.520- 18:36.680* :  restricting basic necessities,
*18:36.680- 18:39.480* :  dissavillions like food and water and fuel,
*18:40.480- 18:42.820* :  bombing areas like schools and hospitals,
*18:44.180- 18:46.500* :  how are governments and leaders held accountable
*18:46.540- 18:49.220* :  for alleged war crimes?
*18:50.020- 18:50.280* :  Frank.
*18:50.780- 18:54.260* :  Okay, well, first of all to answer the first question there,
*18:55.000- 18:58.660* :  it is never justified to use disproportionate
*18:58.940- 19:01.500* :  force against civilians on any side.
*19:01.840- 19:02.800* :  There's no question about that.
*19:03.360- 19:06.340* :  But where I think the Israelis would disagree with you
*19:06.340- 19:08.640* :  is that they would say what they're doing in Gaza
*19:08.640- 19:09.920* :  is not disproportionate.
*19:10.080- 19:11.520* :  Much of the world may disagree with them,
*19:11.960- 19:15.180* :  but they say, look, what happened on October 7th
*19:15.180- 19:19.460* :  was so appalling, so reminiscent of pogroms
*19:19.460- 19:22.360* :  and of the Holocaust, it was the worst single attack
*19:22.940- 19:25.220* :  on Israelis in their entire history
*19:25.220- 19:27.680* :  since the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948,
*19:28.280- 19:30.920* :  that they said we have got to do whatever it takes
*19:31.400- 19:33.320* :  to remove the military threat to our people,
*19:33.320- 19:35.120* :  and that means destroying Hamas.
*19:35.440- 19:37.540* :  And at the time, a lot of Western leaders said,
*19:37.900- 19:39.100* :  yep, we've got your back, Israel,
*19:39.100- 19:42.160* :  do whatever it takes, Israel right or wrong, effectively.
*19:42.800- 19:43.980* :  People having second thoughts now,
*19:44.000- 19:46.740* :  because certainly UN workers
*19:47.120- 19:49.760* :  and from pretty much the entire rest of the Middle East
*19:49.760- 19:53.580* :  are saying what is going on in Gaza now is disproportionate.
*19:53.980- 19:55.800* :  Now, in terms of war crimes
*19:55.800- 19:57.620* :  and bringing people to account for this,
*19:57.640- 19:59.180* :  this is phenomenally difficult,
*19:59.180- 20:01.340* :  because there is a precedent here,
*20:01.600- 20:03.120* :  in March of this year,
*20:03.760- 20:05.840* :  the International Criminal Court in the Hague
*20:06.360- 20:10.640* :  brought charges against both President Putin of Russia
*20:11.160- 20:13.720* :  and his commissioner for children's rights,
*20:14.360- 20:15.620* :  Maria Lavovovov over,
*20:16.080- 20:19.160* :  so there are international arrest warrants out for both of them.
*20:19.860- 20:21.920* :  And it hasn't stopped President Putin
*20:21.920- 20:24.100* :  from traveling to Kazakhstan and to China,
*20:24.640- 20:26.560* :  and I'm sure in due course, you'll go to North Korea.
*20:27.240- 20:29.560* :  It did make him think twice about going to South Africa
*20:30.040- 20:31.580* :  for a bricks summit there.
*20:31.580- 20:32.340* :  He didn't go to that,
*20:32.960- 20:36.400* :  but I don't think that we're going to see big figures like him
*20:36.980- 20:38.820* :  or, I mean, for that matter,
*20:38.820- 20:41.620* :  I mean, what some people would like to see Benjamin N. N. Ahu,
*20:41.620- 20:44.740* :  the Israeli Prime Minister facing a criminal court
*20:44.740- 20:45.960* :  for alleged war crimes.
*20:45.960- 20:48.520* :  He's already got a corruption scandal
*20:48.520- 20:50.340* :  if his own to deal with in his own country,
*20:51.100- 20:52.300* :  but it's just to come back to it.
*20:52.340- 20:55.240* :  It is very, very hard to bring people to justice
*20:55.240- 20:56.000* :  for these things,
*20:56.560- 20:57.560* :  but in the case of Ukraine,
*20:57.560- 20:58.580* :  just to go back to that,
*20:58.580- 21:01.120* :  which is what I've been covering for the last 20 months,
*21:01.740- 21:04.880* :  there are war crimes, prosecution-ready files
*21:04.880- 21:07.980* :  being assembled against alleged perpetrators
*21:07.980- 21:08.860* :  of war crimes there.
*21:09.580- 21:10.940* :  Similar things have been done in Syria,
*21:11.820- 21:14.040* :  but it takes time and it's very difficult.
*21:14.740- 21:15.440* :  Do you want to tip in?
*21:15.820- 21:15.980* :  Yeah.
*21:16.620- 21:18.880* :  The Geneva Conventions with the Rules of War,
*21:18.880- 21:20.640* :  it's interesting how in this war,
*21:20.640- 21:22.500* :  everyone is mentioning the Rules of War,
*21:22.600- 21:25.720* :  but they're absolutely clear that civilians cannot be targeted.
*21:25.720- 21:28.420* :  And one of the areas that has been focused on
*21:28.460- 21:30.280* :  is the siege of Gaza,
*21:30.480- 21:32.980* :  which is effectively denying a whole population,
*21:34.100- 21:36.060* :  electricity, water, fuel,
*21:36.840- 21:38.840* :  and that this is not consistent
*21:38.840- 21:41.120* :  with the obligations of warring parties
*21:41.860- 21:43.380* :  under the Geneva Conventions.
*21:43.420- 21:46.600* :  Now Israel will say that it is denying these services
*21:46.600- 21:51.540* :  to Hamas because Hamas will divert these life-saving goods
*21:51.540- 21:55.320* :  and services in order to carry out its military operations.
*21:55.920- 21:57.940* :  This has been mentioned here in this war
*21:57.940- 21:59.160* :  to pick up where Frank said,
*21:59.580- 22:01.180* :  this has also been mentioned in Ukraine
*22:01.180- 22:04.420* :  where Russia was targeting the energy infrastructure,
*22:05.120- 22:07.220* :  the civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.
*22:07.220- 22:09.440* :  Many voices, particularly among Western leaders,
*22:09.980- 22:11.080* :  were raised at that time.
*22:11.920- 22:13.960* :  Many are now raising them again,
*22:14.680- 22:16.520* :  but some have criticized not as loudly
*22:16.520- 22:18.820* :  as they did in the Ukraine war.
*22:18.820- 22:21.600* :  But I think there will one day be a reckoning
*22:21.600- 22:23.560* :  and let's bear in mind, too,
*22:23.560- 22:25.940* :  that Hamas, in targeting civilians
*22:26.040- 22:29.140* :  in its operations of October the 7th,
*22:29.460- 22:31.280* :  these are also potential war crimes.
*22:31.300- 22:33.340* :  One of the political leaders from Hamas
*22:33.340- 22:35.760* :  told our colleague yesterday in an interview in Beirut
*22:35.760- 22:36.420* :  that they were not.
*22:36.420- 22:38.920* :  There was no command to target civilians.
*22:38.920- 22:41.340* :  They didn't want to take civilians hostage,
*22:41.460- 22:44.820* :  but the evidence is there that civilians were killed
*22:44.900- 22:48.100* :  and civilians were harmed and taken hostage.
*22:48.920- 22:49.720* :  Onto the next question,
*22:49.720- 22:52.140* :  Israel is one of around 85 countries
*22:52.140- 22:55.120* :  that have military service conscription.
*22:55.700- 22:57.180* :  This, listen, has a question about it.
*22:57.800- 22:58.360* :  Hello, everyone.
*22:58.660- 23:00.100* :  My name is Porik Sweeney,
*23:00.560- 23:01.740* :  an Irishman living in Bolivia.
*23:02.900- 23:04.580* :  And so one of my old Israeli friends,
*23:04.620- 23:06.180* :  who I guess could be described as being
*23:06.580- 23:08.580* :  a bit more critical of the Israeli government
*23:08.580- 23:10.980* :  to explain to me one day that he felt
*23:11.000- 23:13.480* :  that the Israeli government uses military service
*23:13.480- 23:15.860* :  as a tool to brainwash the Israeli youth
*23:16.300- 23:18.440* :  against Palestinians and Arabs in general.
*23:18.960- 23:20.660* :  So my question for your experts is,
*23:21.380- 23:24.560* :  what role does the obligatory Israeli military service
*23:24.560- 23:26.080* :  play in perpetuating the conflicts
*23:26.380- 23:30.300* :  and in fermenting anti-Arab sentiment among Israelis?
*23:30.800- 23:32.720* :  And if it does do this, how intentional is it?
*23:33.720- 23:34.040* :  Please.
*23:34.820- 23:37.320* :  I've never done military service in Israel.
*23:37.320- 23:38.080* :  I'm not Israeli.
*23:38.080- 23:41.140* :  So I don't know what they're taught in classes.
*23:41.140- 23:44.060* :  What I do know from having lived here for several years
*23:44.080- 23:45.600* :  and having been here for many decades
*23:45.600- 23:48.980* :  is that a large percentage of Israelis
*23:48.980- 23:51.180* :  do carry out military service.
*23:51.360- 23:52.560* :  But there are many exemptions.
*23:52.560- 23:55.080* :  Older Orthodox Jews can get exemptions
*23:55.080- 23:57.460* :  because they're studying at the Yashivas
*23:57.460- 24:00.360* :  and therefore they have a higher, more noble task.
*24:00.800- 24:03.480* :  Israeli Arabs also don't serve, they're not obliged
*24:03.500- 24:06.760* :  to do the military service, although some can ask to serve.
*24:07.220- 24:10.960* :  The Jews also do serve and for a very long time,
*24:11.060- 24:14.500* :  Israel's military was described as the people's army.
*24:14.500- 24:15.840* :  If you look at the statistics now,
*24:15.840- 24:20.140* :  it doesn't cross all of the residents of the Jewish state,
*24:20.620- 24:22.280* :  but it is a right of passage here.
*24:22.280- 24:24.740* :  It's a very formative experience for the youth.
*24:25.220- 24:27.740* :  What I would say is that it is such a formative experience
*24:27.740- 24:29.680* :  that what you're seeing now is that
*24:30.160- 24:34.080* :  we've met, we've spoken to Israeli reservists arriving here
*24:34.080- 24:37.400* :  from around the world saying my country is under threat
*24:37.400- 24:40.420* :  and I want to serve, this is my war too.
*24:40.860- 24:42.680* :  So it helped bring the nation together,
*24:42.680- 24:45.040* :  whatever differences they may have on other issues
*24:45.560- 24:47.200* :  when the country feels that threat,
*24:47.200- 24:49.200* :  but I cannot answer directly
*24:49.800- 24:53.280* :  whether that contributes to an anti-Arab sentiment.
*24:53.280- 24:56.440* :  I know many Israeli members of the peace movement
*24:56.500- 24:58.640* :  who also did their military service.
*25:00.060- 25:01.140* :  So to finish then,
*25:01.340- 25:04.460* :  this email from a listener who asked to be anonymous,
*25:04.460- 25:05.560* :  we've wasted up.
*25:06.540- 25:08.120* :  I've heard about several protests
*25:08.120- 25:11.080* :  supporting either Israeli's or Palestinians
*25:11.860- 25:13.580* :  in the current polarized climber.
*25:13.940- 25:17.400* :  How can we create a space for a humanitarian approach
*25:17.400- 25:20.480* :  that supports a peaceful resolution to the conflict?
*25:21.280- 25:24.580* :  And what can I do as an individual to be part of a solution?
*25:25.080- 25:27.380* :  It's such a huge question, one for you, Ruth.
*25:28.060- 25:29.700* :  It is such an important question
*25:30.100- 25:31.640* :  and the answer to that question
*25:32.220- 25:34.820* :  is the answer to whether or not this region
*25:35.260- 25:37.680* :  can ever see peace, can ever share the land
*25:38.480- 25:42.220* :  and allow, in this case, both Israelis and Palestinians
*25:42.860- 25:45.700* :  to live side-by-side, a Palestinian state side-by-side
*25:46.100- 25:47.280* :  to a Jewish state.
*25:47.820- 25:51.560* :  But at this particular moment in time, anger,
*25:51.980- 25:53.940* :  anger is running very, very high.
*25:53.940- 25:57.700* :  Anger is boiling over, passions are inflamed.
*25:58.160- 26:01.380* :  Around the world we have seen streets filled
*26:01.380- 26:03.600* :  with either anti-Israeli protests
*26:04.360- 26:06.440* :  or anti-Palestinian protests
*26:06.600- 26:08.360* :  and there is nothing in between.
*26:08.360- 26:11.700* :  It is a zero-sum game at the moment.
*26:12.060- 26:14.780* :  I think perhaps the only glimmer of hope that I can see
*26:14.780- 26:18.960* :  that is blinking away, buried amongst all this awful news
*26:18.960- 26:20.000* :  coming out of this conflict,
*26:20.660- 26:22.820* :  is that there is, I think, an acceptance
*26:22.900- 26:27.320* :  around the world that the problem in the Middle East
*26:27.620- 26:30.520* :  of a just solution for Israelis and Palestinians
*26:31.120- 26:31.940* :  cannot be ignored.
*26:32.580- 26:36.100* :  Because it was being ignored, a number of Arab countries,
*26:36.660- 26:41.420* :  UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and potentially Saudi Arabia,
*26:42.300- 26:44.120* :  they had made peace with Israel,
*26:44.120- 26:46.820* :  they had normalized their ties, Saudi Arabia was poised
*26:46.820- 26:49.160* :  to do the same and this would have certainly
*26:49.160- 26:52.700* :  sidelined both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority.
*26:53.540- 26:57.000* :  With an idea, well, let's just get on with life normally.
*26:57.600- 27:00.180* :  There is no such thing as normal life for Palestinians
*27:00.180- 27:03.580* :  and many cases for Israelis who come under constant fire
*27:04.000- 27:04.660* :  from Gaza.
*27:05.260- 27:07.600* :  So it can't go on unnoticed.
*27:07.600- 27:10.180* :  You can't keep kettling 2.3 million people
*27:10.180- 27:14.160* :  into this tiny real estate, tiny strip of the Gaza Strip.
*27:14.360- 27:16.160* :  Not able to get in or out in most cases
*27:16.740- 27:19.220* :  and denying the Palestinians a homeland
*27:19.960- 27:21.760* :  according to UN resolutions and so on.
*27:21.760- 27:25.380* :  So until that is resolved, sadly,
*27:26.000- 27:28.060* :  I think the cycle of violence is going to continue.
*27:28.060- 27:29.940* :  There may be ceasefires, there may be pauses,
*27:29.940- 27:32.180* :  there may be lulls, but ultimately,
*27:32.180- 27:36.040* :  it's going to grind on until there is a fair solution
*27:36.040- 27:36.900* :  for both sides.
*27:37.800- 27:40.540* :  And yet in the midst of this bonfire,
*27:41.220- 27:45.100* :  you still hear those voices and it's very, very touching
*27:45.100- 27:50.840* :  to hear that even some of the family members of hostages
*27:51.040- 27:53.340* :  is really whose family members are now
*27:53.340- 27:55.240* :  being held hostage by Hamas.
*27:55.800- 27:59.640* :  They are saying we need to find a way forward.
*28:00.080- 28:03.260* :  More violence is not the answer to this solution.
*28:03.260- 28:05.920* :  We have to find ways to live together.
*28:06.440- 28:08.980* :  Neither of us is going to go away.
*28:09.440- 28:12.800* :  There are voices in the midst of a much larger
*28:12.800- 28:15.640* :  roar of a very polarized situation.
*28:16.260- 28:18.200* :  And if I would give you advice about how
*28:18.200- 28:21.080* :  you can be part of the solution, and I think,
*28:21.080- 28:23.960* :  well, Frank and I, this is the job we try to do,
*28:24.720- 28:28.420* :  try to listen to both sides, try to understand
*28:28.420- 28:32.040* :  why they're angry, what is the root of their anger,
*28:32.600- 28:36.140* :  what is it that is fueling these emotions for them?
*28:36.140- 28:39.220* :  And I think we have to not just listen,
*28:39.220- 28:42.360* :  but we have to really hear what people are saying,
*28:42.360- 28:46.680* :  but unfortunately, now, people are talking past each other,
*28:46.880- 28:50.100* :  and it's not surprising, given the intensity of this war.
*28:52.580- 28:54.660* :  And there we must end this special edition
*28:54.700- 28:55.960* :  of the Global News Podcast.
*28:56.120- 28:57.600* :  Thank you to Lee's Ducet,
