*01:24.940- 01:28.180* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:28.180- 01:31.120* :  the 10th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:31.740- 01:37.600* :  Israel's missiles rain down on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Saturday's deadly Hamas attack.
*01:37.600- 01:42.620* :  The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Monday's air strikes are just the beginning
*01:42.620- 01:44.880* :  while the UN urges restraint.
*01:44.880- 01:48.380* :  While I recognize Israel's legitimate security concerns,
*01:49.260- 01:52.640* :  I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted
*01:52.640- 01:55.580* :  in strict accordance with international humanitarian law.
*01:56.280- 01:59.300* :  900 Israelis are now confirmed to have been killed.
*01:59.300- 02:04.260* :  Israel's strikes on Gaza are said to have killed almost 700 Palestinians.
*02:04.880- 02:07.760* :  Gaza is only 365 square kilometers.
*02:08.480- 02:09.440* :  We have nowhere to go.
*02:09.720- 02:12.300* :  There is no place safe for cousins.
*02:14.180- 02:19.540* :  Also, in this podcast, the search continues for survivors of Afghanistan's deadly earthquake.
*02:19.540- 02:24.820* :  A study on equal pay for women through history wins the Nobel Prize for Economics
*02:25.500- 02:32.360* :  and how the Kenyan athlete Kelvin Kiptum knocked more than half a minute off the men's marathon
*02:32.400- 02:33.140* :  world record.
*02:38.020- 02:43.160* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned his country's response to the deadly
*02:43.160- 02:48.380* :  attacks by Hamas gunmen at the weekend will be terrible and will change the Middle East.
*02:48.720- 02:50.720* :  This is only the beginning, he said.
*02:51.160- 02:56.880* :  Later on Monday, in an address to the nation, Mr Netanyahu called on opposition parties to join
*02:56.880- 02:58.440* :  a national unity government.
*02:58.440- 03:03.020* :  He added that Israel was now engaged in a war to ensure its existence.
*03:06.180- 03:12.000* :  I call on the opposition leaders to form immediately an emergency union government
*03:12.000- 03:18.160* :  without prior conditions as happened at the start of a six-day war, citizens of Israel.
*03:18.780- 03:22.920* :  And I emphasize that we have only just begun to strike at Hamas.
*03:23.400- 03:29.020* :  I said that every place from which Hamas operates will be turned into ruins.
*03:29.140- 03:34.280* :  It's already happening today and it will continue happening even more.
*03:35.040- 03:40.960* :  With the number of dead rising to 900, Israel has called up 300,000 military
*03:40.960- 03:43.960* :  reservists and has locked down the Gaza Strip.
*03:44.260- 03:49.420* :  In Gaza, funerals have been held for some of the almost 700 Palestinians who've died
*03:49.420- 03:52.300* :  in New York, the Secretary-General of the United Nations,
*03:52.760- 03:55.520* :  Antonio Guterres has been addressing the crisis.
*03:56.360- 03:59.680* :  Nothing can justify these acts of terror and the killing,
*03:59.680- 04:01.820* :  maiming, and abduction of civilians.
*04:01.940- 04:07.200* :  I reiterate my call to immediately seize these attacks and release all hostages.
*04:07.760- 04:12.080* :  In the face of this unprecedented attacks, Israeli air strikes have bounded Gaza.
*04:12.540- 04:15.540* :  While I recognize Israel's legitimate security concerns,
*04:16.420- 04:21.020* :  I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted in strict accordance
*04:21.020- 04:22.760* :  with international humanitarian law.
*04:23.240- 04:26.820* :  Civilians must be respected and protected at all times.
*04:27.760- 04:32.740* :  I am deeply distressed by today's announcement that Israel will initiate a complete siege
*04:32.740- 04:39.180* :  of the Gaza Strip, relive an entry of essential supplies into Gaza must be facilitated,
*04:39.740- 04:44.140* :  and UN will continue efforts to provide aid to respond to these needs.
*04:44.820- 04:47.440* :  The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
*04:47.940- 04:53.240* :  a correspondent in Jerusalem John Donerson reports on a day of fast-moving events.
*04:58.900- 05:02.200* :  Two days after Hamas' unprecedented cross-border assault,
*05:02.720- 05:05.380* :  Israel's retaliation appears to be ramping up.
*05:05.380- 05:14.420* :  It's military now says it's hit some 2,400 targets within Gaza,
*05:15.000- 05:17.660* :  with hundreds overnight, and more during the day.
*05:22.440- 05:27.880* :  Israel's defense minister, Yaya Ghalla, has ordered what he called a complete siege of Gaza.
*05:31.220- 05:34.580* :  He said, now food, water, or electricity should be allowed in.
*05:35.100- 05:38.060* :  We are fighting animals, he said, and are acting accordingly.
*05:44.620- 05:48.500* :  Meanwhile, air aid sirens continue to be heard as far away as Jerusalem,
*05:48.500- 05:53.700* :  as Palestinian militants fired rockets, some of which were shot down by Israel's Iron
*05:53.700- 05:59.220* :  Dome defense system. Israel says it has now regained control of its communities near Gaza,
*05:59.220- 06:02.480* :  but it says some Palestinian militants remain active,
*06:02.980- 06:06.080* :  and it has acknowledged its border is not yet fully secure.
*06:07.200- 06:12.420* :  Israeli officials have likened Saturdays assault by Hamas to the September 11th attacks on the
*06:12.420- 06:18.360* :  United States, calling it the worst single day in Israel's history. But speaking to the BBC,
*06:18.360- 06:23.580* :  Bassim Naim, head of international relations for Hamas, defended his group's actions.
*06:36.460- 06:43.120* :  We want our prisoners released, lifting the siege once and finally and totally and immediately.
*06:43.500- 06:49.160* :  Hamas will want to use the dozens of hostages it has seized to try to secure some of those demands.
*06:49.220- 06:54.080* :  It says four of the hostages have been killed already in Israeli air strikes.
*06:54.180- 07:00.540* :  But there is increased speculation here that Israel is preparing for a ground operation in Gaza
*07:01.140- 07:04.760* :  that will use force to try to free those who have been captured.
*07:05.420- 07:11.660* :  John Donerson, a defense correspondent Jonathan Biel is near Israel's border with Gaza close
*07:11.740- 07:18.380* :  to where the Hamas gunmen came across. There are shot up and burnt out vehicles all along this road.
*07:19.220- 07:24.840* :  These clearly belonging to Israeli civilians who were fleeing, who were caught up in what
*07:24.840- 07:32.360* :  essentially was a massacre. Also along the road, the shot up trucks of Hamas fighters,
*07:32.360- 07:40.700* :  dead bodies as well lying on the side of the street. And in the distance you can see plumes of smoke
*07:40.700- 07:51.960* :  rising just next to the border with Gaza. It is now three days since Hamas fighters infiltrated
*07:51.960- 07:56.260* :  across the border. We've just been told there's an air raid, so we've been told to go into a
*07:56.260- 08:04.400* :  shelter nearby. And still, Israeli forces are clearing up this area. And there is more to come we
*08:04.400- 08:10.500* :  know because we have seen troops and tanks. There's more gunfire there, massing at the border,
*08:11.660- 08:16.780* :  which looks like preparations for a potential incursion into Gaza itself.
*08:19.720- 08:24.880* :  Jonathan Biel, as you heard in our earlier report, Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues.
*08:34.280- 08:39.240* :  And Palestinians living in the densely packed territory are now living in fear of their lives
*08:39.240- 08:46.300* :  and facing the consequence of a total siege. Basil Al-Sorani works for a Palestinian advocacy group
*08:46.800- 08:49.500* :  and lives in a neighborhood in the southern part of Gaza.
*08:50.120- 08:56.880* :  Gaza is only 365 square kilometers. We have nowhere to go. There is no place safe for
*08:56.880- 09:02.080* :  gazines. There is no way to go to Egypt. We can't even go to the supermarket right now. You
*09:02.080- 09:07.920* :  expect us to go to Egypt. We're under constant bombing. The only thing we can do is just sit at
*09:07.920- 09:14.840* :  home and pray that the next rocket or the next air strike or the next bomb fired from a tank or
*09:14.840- 09:21.520* :  from a war seaship will not land on our heads. Israel has a duty to protect civilians and put
*09:21.520- 09:26.820* :  us aside from its conflict with Hamas. Not all Gaza strip are Hamas. We are Palestinian civilians.
*09:26.820- 09:32.560* :  Why should we pay the price? Rishi Abu Al-Aluf is the BBC's correspondent in Gaza.
*09:33.040- 09:39.020* :  The sound of Israeli fighter jets are flying overhead and the Israeli air strikes just hit this
*09:39.140- 09:44.080* :  area. We had to move from our office. This is a residential building where I live. It's a
*09:44.400- 09:50.080* :  very densely populated area and my way here I saw many families are leaving this city center to
*09:50.080- 09:56.360* :  this side of the city. It's in the south inside of the city but since then we had about five or
*09:56.360- 10:03.060* :  six air strikes. I think Gaza has never seen this scale of an intensity of Israeli air strike ever.
*10:03.480- 10:08.060* :  I have been covering many wars between Hamas and Israel but this time and this day especially
*10:08.060- 10:14.880* :  I think it's the biggest ever Israeli air strike that targeted Gaza. The most significant
*10:14.880- 10:20.640* :  air strike today targeted a market in the middle of Jabaliyah refugee camp. Jabaliyah camp
*10:20.640- 10:27.880* :  is the biggest camp in Gaza where 120,000 people live there. The health ministry said over 40
*10:27.880- 10:34.300* :  people died. People were shoving in this area this morning and an air strike destroyed the house
*10:34.300- 10:40.600* :  injuring as many as 100 people. Since yesterday only about 100 people have been killed and the
*10:40.600- 10:47.060* :  health official saying they are struggling to cope with the number of people injured from the
*10:47.060- 10:52.520* :  Israeli air strikes across the Gaza strip. They said we are running out of medicine. We are
*10:52.520- 10:59.460* :  running out of fuel to operate the generators that is providing power for the hospitals. 80 percent
*10:59.460- 11:05.220* :  of the people in Gaza they have no power, no internet for the last three days.
*11:05.600- 11:12.640* :  The BBC's Rochty Abu Aluf in Gaza. Meanwhile Israel says gunmen who came into its territory from
*11:12.640- 11:18.380* :  Lebanon have been killed. For more on that I spoke to our correspondent in Lebanon, Linus and Jab.
*11:19.160- 11:25.600* :  At least three members of his beloved love were killed by the raid from the Israelis. The Israeli
*11:25.600- 11:31.980* :  saying responding to militants crossing into its territory. We also know that some members of the
*11:31.980- 11:39.120* :  Al-Quds brigades of the armed wing of Palestinian islamic she had tried to get in saying that it's
*11:39.120- 11:45.280* :  part of the attack launched on Israel. We are getting the news bits and bits by bits because it's
*11:45.280- 11:50.500* :  just happened in the last few hours. The main focus is what's happening in Gaza. But many are
*11:50.500- 11:55.520* :  worried that this will expand to more territories and one of them is Lebanon because of
*11:55.520- 12:01.240* :  Hasbullah's presence and its history of tension and fights with Israel. But to be clear, Israel
*12:01.240- 12:07.500* :  is shelling Lebanon. Well, they've launched an attack today to stop the militants from crossing
*12:07.500- 12:14.720* :  into Israel. There were some rocket firing between both sides yesterday. It stayed at this level.
*12:14.720- 12:20.900* :  It's not. It hasn't escalated further. But it's really a tense time that we need to watch by hour
*12:20.900- 12:25.120* :  and day by day to see what's going to happen at this front of the conflict.
*12:25.320- 12:30.140* :  Briefly, Lena, there are many questions about Iran's encouragement for all of this.
*12:30.720- 12:35.840* :  Any angle on that that you can see? You know, there was a deal that was about to be broken
*12:35.840- 12:41.580* :  between Saudi Arabia and Israel and many in the region. They don't have interest in this to
*12:41.580- 12:48.040* :  happen and probably Iran is one of them. But of course, don't forget that, you know, for the Palestinians
*12:48.040- 12:53.900* :  they've been under siege, they've been under living under difficult conditions. So many are arguing
*12:53.900- 13:00.080* :  that Hamas wanted to launch this to put some pressure and change the negotiation terms of the
*13:00.080- 13:07.940* :  table. Lena, Sinjab, about 100 people are being held hostage by Hamas. On Monday, the spokesman
*13:07.940- 13:12.620* :  for the armed wing of the militant group said they will start killing the Israelis being held
*13:12.620- 13:17.900* :  captive in Gaza if Israel bombs more civilian houses in Gaza without prior warning.
*13:17.900- 13:23.940* :  At Middle East correspondent Yolanda Nell went to Tel Aviv to meet a man who says five members of
*13:23.940- 13:30.420* :  his family are missing. She's sending this heart and she's saying that I'm not sure we're going to
*13:31.160- 13:36.900* :  survive this. For Edo Dan, the horror of Saturday's events played out from early morning
*13:36.900- 13:43.320* :  on his family's WhatsApp group. His cousin, Hadass, who lives in near Oz, a kabut's next to Gaza
*13:43.320- 13:50.480* :  updated her relatives as Hamas gunman broke into her home. Hadass did survive, rescued at nightfall,
*13:50.980- 13:55.720* :  but her two children, their father, her niece and her 80-year-old mother, who lived in
*13:55.780- 14:05.140* :  nearby, were all missing. The main clue about what happened was a disturbing video which surfaced
*14:05.140- 14:11.840* :  on social media. It appeared to show eras Hadass's 12-year-old son being taken by Hamas fighters
*14:11.840- 14:17.840* :  into Gaza. Edo says they must be released. Just to get him out of this confrontation,
*14:18.580- 14:24.740* :  it's not for kids, it's not for older people. I don't think there's any war ethics that were not
*14:24.740- 14:32.020* :  violated here. Even war has rules and ethics and limits. More and more stories are coming to light.
*14:32.020- 14:36.500* :  The many apparently held include other residents of southern Israeli communities,
*14:36.580- 14:42.820* :  party goers from a dance festival and soldiers captured when Hamas overran military bases.
*14:42.900- 14:47.840* :  Their relatives desperate for information say they're getting little official help.
*14:48.560- 14:53.180* :  International mediators are now said to be trying to negotiate with both sides over those held
*14:53.180- 14:58.120* :  captive, but with every hour that passes fears grow for their safety.
*15:06.440- 15:11.440* :  Hello. The fast-moving events in Israel and Gaza have prompted many of you to get in touch with
*15:11.440- 15:17.060* :  your questions. How did we get here? What's at the root of the conflict? What are both sides
*15:17.060- 15:21.940* :  saying? What role does the rest of the world have to play? And what happens next?
*15:22.980- 15:28.540* :  We hope to answer as many of your questions as possible in a special global news podcast coming soon.
*15:29.160- 15:37.760* :  As ever, send us an email or voice message to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. Thank you.
*15:42.420- 15:47.560* :  Robert F. Kennedy, the nephew of the assassinated president, John F. Kennedy,
*15:48.060- 15:52.540* :  has announced he's running as an independent in next year's US presidential election.
*15:52.540- 15:58.500* :  He had initially been challenging Joe Biden for the Democratic Party's 2024 nomination.
*15:58.500- 16:04.600* :  He launched his campaign at an event in Philadelphia, a number of members of the Kennedy family,
*16:04.600- 16:10.480* :  one of America's most well-known political dynasties, have criticized his views and his decision
*16:10.480- 16:16.560* :  to run from Washington. Here's our correspondent, Gary O'Donohue. Robert F. Kennedy's junior is
*16:16.560- 16:22.640* :  something of an enigma. For years, he was a respected environmental lawyer, but with his turn into politics,
*16:22.640- 16:28.620* :  he's pursued an eclectic populist agenda, sprinkled with a mix of anti-vaccination rhetoric
*16:28.620- 16:33.720* :  and conspiracy theories. Despite dropping out of the race for the democratic nomination,
*16:33.720- 16:39.320* :  and running as an independent, polls have suggested he could take votes from both Republicans
*16:39.320- 16:44.740* :  and Democrats in the presidential election. And in a tight race, that could be significant.
*16:44.820- 16:51.300* :  He's also reasonably well-funded, which makes his pitch a potentially disrupting factor for
*16:51.300- 16:56.460* :  the two main parties. Third party candidates don't win presidential elections in America,
*16:56.460- 17:03.040* :  but they can influence the outcome. Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and Ross Perot in 1992.
*17:04.240- 17:10.720* :  Gary O'Donohue in Washington. The search is still going on in Afghanistan for survivors of
*17:10.720- 17:16.020* :  Saturday's earthquake, which left over a thousand people dead. Philippe Kropf works for the
*17:16.020- 17:21.860* :  World Food Program in Kabul. Several villages seem to have been completely flattened.
*17:21.860- 17:26.820* :  Other villages have had severe damage, and the families who have stayed close to the villages
*17:26.820- 17:32.880* :  they are spending a second night outside. It is already fairly cold, winter is coming,
*17:32.880- 17:39.560* :  and repeated aftershocks have always been reported. From what the colleagues in the field are telling us,
*17:39.600- 17:44.800* :  the people they're meeting, they're terrified, they're hungry, and they're desperate for assistance.
*17:45.860- 17:49.140* :  Ali Arian from our Afghans. This gave me an update.
*17:49.960- 17:56.260* :  It's the third night that people are spending their nights outside in the streets and
*17:56.260- 18:02.020* :  boulevards and parks with families and children. People are very scared, and they're scared of
*18:02.740- 18:08.260* :  stronger tremors. Today at least five tremors. One of them was very strong felt, and that's why
*18:08.260- 18:14.980* :  people are very scared. The casualty figures, the UNS still says more than 1,000 people have been
*18:14.980- 18:21.440* :  killed, but over 500 people, according to UN, are still missing. More than 11,000 people are
*18:21.440- 18:29.600* :  affected in her own province. The earthquake happened on Saturday at 11 a.m., which is the first day
*18:29.600- 18:36.540* :  of the week in Afghans, and most men were outside, and women and children, they were inside. That's
*18:36.540- 18:43.820* :  why most of the victims, most of the people who are under the rubble, they are children and women,
*18:43.820- 18:50.900* :  and over 9,000 homes are destroyed, especially in villages, in a few villages that completely
*18:50.900- 18:56.300* :  are flattened and destroyed. And rescue efforts after earthquakes are always difficult, but
*18:56.480- 19:02.120* :  there are so many other factors here, aren't there? Yeah, especially in the case of Afghans, and it's
*19:02.120- 19:07.740* :  tricky because after the parliament took over Afghans and they put restrictions on women working
*19:07.740- 19:14.340* :  for UN and other NGOs. Most of the NGOs, they shut down their operation in Afghans, and they
*19:14.340- 19:20.220* :  had their force to leave the country. It takes time for the A2 to go to the affected areas.
*19:21.660- 19:27.400* :  Mainly in the past two, three days, local people, they were trying to remove their loved ones from
*19:27.400- 19:32.660* :  under the rubble with bare hands and shovels. The survivors, obviously, they are in need of food,
*19:32.660- 19:38.340* :  drinking water, medicine, clothes, and tents. They're in an urgent need of temporary shelter.
*19:38.840- 19:42.720* :  Ali Aryan. Here in Britain, lawyers for the Home Secretary,
*19:42.720- 19:47.560* :  Suella Bravaman, have told the Supreme Court that Rwanda can be trusted to treat
*19:47.560- 19:52.960* :  humanly any asylum seekers sent there under the government's plan. In the opening submissions
*19:52.960- 19:58.300* :  of a three-day hearing, lawyers said the Court of Appeal had been wrong to block the plan
*19:58.680- 20:04.700* :  and urged the Court to let the scheme go ahead, our home and legal correspondent Dominic Cassiani
*20:04.700- 20:11.020* :  reports. This 16-month legal battle comes down to whether or not Rwanda has passed strict legal tests
*20:11.020- 20:15.660* :  that it would protect genuine refugees and not send them back to countries where they could be
*20:15.660- 20:21.640* :  treated in humanly. Sir James EDKC, the government's lead barrister, told the Supreme Court's five
*20:21.640- 20:26.920* :  justices that there was every reason to conclude the plan would work because there was both a
*20:26.920- 20:32.800* :  reputational and financial incentive for Rwanda to comply. The scheme was so detailed there was
*20:32.800- 20:39.300* :  even a clear plan to independently monitor what happens to each migrant. Whatever debate there may
*20:39.300- 20:44.900* :  have been, or may not have been, about Rwanda's conduct will record in the past, is we submit at
*20:44.900- 20:51.740* :  best peripherally relevant. This is a new context with a new set of detailed arrangements that have
*20:51.740- 20:57.840* :  been committed to by Rwanda and the UK in significant part with those concerns in mind.
*20:58.340- 21:03.020* :  This afternoon lawyers for the migrants said Suela Bravaman had no answer to evidence
*21:03.020- 21:08.340* :  that Rwanda was an authoritarian, one-party state, and the cause of the deal had been entitled
*21:08.340- 21:13.840* :  to block the scheme because the country's asylum system was arbitrary and unfair. The hearing
*21:13.840- 21:19.180* :  is expected to last until Wednesday with a judgment to come later. Dominic Cassiani.
*21:20.480- 21:26.480* :  The winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Economics is the American Economic Historian Claudia
*21:26.480- 21:32.860* :  Golden for her work on women's employment and pay. The 77-year-old academic currently teaches
*21:32.860- 21:39.380* :  labour market history at Harvard University. She's only the third woman to get this award and the first
*21:39.380- 21:45.260* :  not to share it with male colleagues. After receiving the news, Professor Golden was asked to sum
*21:45.260- 21:52.140* :  up her research to the press. I work on long-term change in economic history in particular the
*21:52.140- 21:59.540* :  evolution of women's economic role and where we are today in the fact that there has been
*22:00.140- 22:05.800* :  enormous change and yet there are still large differences between women and men in terms of what
*22:05.800- 22:13.200* :  they do, how they were unirraided and so on, and the question is why is this the case and that's
*22:13.200- 22:18.400* :  what the work is about. Our business reporter Lucy Hooker told me more about her work.
*22:19.040- 22:24.300* :  What she did was she went back over 200 years looking at women's employment in the United States,
*22:25.020- 22:29.460* :  whether they were working, what kind of work they were doing and how much they were earning,
*22:30.060- 22:36.420* :  and that's not as straightforward as it sounds because before about 1940 the census would
*22:36.420- 22:41.960* :  mostly just ask men those kinds of questions. There weren't any records really for women's
*22:41.960- 22:46.100* :  employment so she had to do a lot of work just to try and get the basic information together,
*22:46.720- 22:55.220* :  but she did manage to chart those changes and she showed that in the 1800s as industrialisation
*22:55.220- 23:01.420* :  came along and work moved out of the home and into factories, women started to work less before
*23:01.420- 23:07.860* :  that they had worked quite a lot and then in the 1900s as the service economy grew women were
*23:07.860- 23:14.600* :  pulled back into work like hospitality, hairdressing, teaching. So what conclusions have she drawn
*23:14.600- 23:21.780* :  from that? Essentially that there hasn't been a steady linear progress towards closing the gap
*23:21.780- 23:29.000* :  between men's occupations and women's and earnings. She did say that things like the arrival of the
*23:29.000- 23:34.880* :  contraceptive pill allowing women to plan their pregnancies more easily made a difference and that
*23:34.880- 23:42.140* :  access to higher education helped women's earnings but that there are still obstacles. So in more
*23:42.140- 23:48.120* :  recent years she said it was the choices that women were making around which career to follow
*23:48.120- 23:54.320* :  and what kind of education to pursue that left women earning less and interestingly she said
*23:54.320- 24:01.860* :  more recent years in higher income countries. Mostly the gap is down now simply to the impact of
*24:01.860- 24:06.900* :  having a child which takes the woman out of the workplace temporarily and hits her earnings.
*24:06.980- 24:12.620* :  Professor Goldin herself doesn't recommend certain paths for governments to take but she does
*24:12.620- 24:19.500* :  try to tell us why we still have such a discrepancy between what women earn and what men earn so that
*24:19.500- 24:23.800* :  if you understand the sickness then you can pick the right medicine. Lucy Hooker.
*24:24.720- 24:31.600* :  Now a story of an astonishing human feat. The Kenyan runner Kelvin Kippton broke the men's
*24:31.600- 24:38.280* :  marathon world record in Chicago on Sunday, winning in two hours and 35 seconds to beat his
*24:38.280- 24:44.500* :  compatriot Elliott Kippchoge's previous mark by more than 30 seconds and he was quite close to
*24:44.500- 24:50.680* :  running a marathon under two hours which looks like a target that might soon be broken. Ed Cesar
*24:50.680- 24:57.160* :  is the author of two hours the quest to run the impossible marathon. He spoke to Nulam Agavan
*24:57.160- 25:02.460* :  about the significance of the achievement. It's a pretty astonishing feat of athleticism.
*25:02.860- 25:07.920* :  I have been privileged to watch a lot of very very fast marathons in the last few years
*25:08.260- 25:13.820* :  and he smashed the world record. It's worth thinking about at home how fast it is. Most
*25:13.820- 25:21.160* :  treadmills at local gyms don't go as fast as he ran in two hours. Really? So it is really unimaginable
*25:21.160- 25:26.020* :  for most people just how quickly this guy's going and when you see him finishing the race he's
*25:26.020- 25:31.100* :  finishing at a sprint that you know the knees are pumping you know he looks like he's flying I
*25:31.100- 25:37.540* :  mean it's just incredible. So this was beating Kippchoge's previous mark by more than 30 seconds.
*25:37.660- 25:44.080* :  What does it take to make that leap? He was wearing some incredible shoes you know shoe technologies
*25:44.500- 25:49.120* :  come on massively in the last few years you know Elliott Kippchoge himself was the beneficiary of
*25:49.140- 25:56.220* :  very new technology from Nike when he started breaking these records in 2017, 2019 and then
*25:56.220- 26:00.960* :  laterally. But the shoes I remember the controversy over the vapor fly and that
*26:01.860- 26:10.220* :  is it possible to differentiate exactly how much technology is that play and how much the
*26:10.220- 26:16.160* :  human body is? What you see is that the world record is falling very very quickly. I mean I think
*26:16.160- 26:21.300* :  Elliott Kippchoge was a kind of generational athlete and maybe Calvin Kippsome is as well.
*26:21.660- 26:25.940* :  Even in cases before we had athletes who we think we'll never see the like of them again,
*26:26.240- 26:30.480* :  the world record hasn't fallen quite as quick since it's fallen in the last five or six years.
*26:30.480- 26:35.700* :  So you do feel like the shoes are really helping these amazing athletes to go quicker.
*26:36.000- 26:40.220* :  You know it's very hard to say what is in the body and what is in the shoes and also what is in
*26:40.220- 26:46.240* :  the mind? It's very hard to disintegrate all of these different factors. We're also talking about
*26:47.040- 26:52.680* :  Kenyans here. Why in particular do you feel they are excelling in this particular field?
*26:52.880- 26:56.820* :  There's this extraordinary mixture, particularly in this one part of Kenya on the
*26:57.060- 27:03.020* :  western escarmament of the Rift Valley where a lot of the Kalinjin tribe live. The history is
*27:03.020- 27:08.020* :  lowland and they moved up to the islands a few generations ago and so they're getting all this
*27:08.020- 27:13.880* :  physiological benefit from living high since they started winning medals in the 60s. This has become
*27:14.340- 27:19.180* :  a thing that they know that they're good at and that is a kind of self-perpetuating process.
*27:20.140- 27:25.740* :  It's also a pretty poor region and you know there are financial awards on offer for the best runners.
*27:25.740- 27:29.580* :  So this is seen as a way out physiologically. There's been doesn't work done on you know whether
*27:29.900- 27:34.400* :  walking and running barefoot to school as children is strengthening those parts of the body
*27:34.400- 27:38.600* :  you know the lower parts of the leg and so on. But I think it's this kind of magical combination
*27:38.600- 27:44.620* :  of the right conditions, certain physiological factors, culture and this great desire to
*27:44.620- 27:51.740* :  break out. Ed sees the author of two hours the quest to run the impossible marathon.
*27:53.760- 27:59.680* :  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the global news podcast later.
