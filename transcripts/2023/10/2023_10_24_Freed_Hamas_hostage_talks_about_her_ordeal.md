*00:37.420- 00:41.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:43.040- 00:49.760* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 1300 hours GMT on Tuesday the 24th of October these are our main stories.
*00:49.840- 00:56.320* :  85-year-old Israeli woman who is freed after being taken hostage by her mass has spoken about her
*00:56.320- 01:02.000* :  ordeal. Israel has kept up its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. We hear from our reporter in the
*01:02.000- 01:07.780* :  south of the territory. A dispute between rival mining unions in South Africa has kept hundreds
*01:07.780- 01:17.280* :  of workers underground since Sunday. Also in this podcast. Just three years ago one in 25 car
*01:17.280- 01:23.200* :  soul to electric and now that is one in five which is staggering. The new report suggests the
*01:23.200- 01:30.140* :  world is on an unstoppable shift towards renewable energy and a cautionary tale about fame, family
*01:30.140- 01:33.960* :  and betrayal. Britney Spears publishes her autobiography.
*01:38.680- 01:43.900* :  One of the two elderly women released by her mass after being abducted and kept hostage in Gaza
*01:43.900- 01:50.240* :  for 16 days has been speaking to the media in Tel Aviv. Yokevede lift shits was handed over
*01:50.600- 01:56.260* :  alongside New York Cooper but their husbands and more than 200 other people remain in Gaza.
*01:57.000- 02:01.800* :  The elderly women had both been taken from their homes in a caboot close to the Gaza border.
*02:02.380- 02:07.660* :  Many of their neighbours and friends were murdered in the attack more than two weeks ago. Yokevede
*02:07.660- 02:13.620* :  lift shits spoke of her ordeal in Hebrew to a crowded news conference describing first how she
*02:13.620- 02:20.640* :  was kidnapped. Her daughter Sharon translated for her. My mom is saying that she was taken on the back
*02:20.800- 02:27.040* :  of a motorbike with her legs on one side and her head on another side. That she was taken through
*02:27.040- 02:33.820* :  the cloud fields with the men in front on one side and a man behind her and that while she was
*02:34.640- 02:43.880* :  being taken she was hit by sticks by a shabab until they reached the tunnels. There they walked
*02:43.880- 02:54.140* :  for a few kilometers on the wet ground. There are a huge network of tunnels underneath. It looks
*02:54.140- 03:00.460* :  like a spider web. Yokevede lift shits also described how they were treated by their hostage
*03:00.460- 03:07.280* :  takers. They were given medicines that the people were friendly that they kept the place very clean.
*03:07.280- 03:13.660* :  They were very concerned about them. I heard more details from our correspondent in Jerusalem. Yolanda.
*03:14.400- 03:18.980* :  This was quite a remarkable news conference by Yokevede lift shits. She's been undergoing medical
*03:18.980- 03:24.820* :  checks and seeing her family at a hospital in Tel Aviv and she was accompanied by her daughter
*03:24.820- 03:30.180* :  Sharon who just flown in from the UK. She's British Israeli. Sharon had said early that her mother
*03:30.180- 03:37.020* :  was very sharp and keen to share information and we did see that. She talked about how she was
*03:37.020- 03:41.900* :  taken into Gaza by Hamas Gumman on the back of a motorbike. She said that she had been beaten
*03:42.460- 03:47.980* :  that was quite an ordeal as she went in but at the same time she said that once she arrived
*03:47.980- 03:53.500* :  she'd had her watch and her jewelry taken but she was treated then very well. She said that it was
*03:53.500- 03:59.360* :  clear there had been a lot of preparations for the hostages. She said this actually reflects on
*03:59.360- 04:04.340* :  some of the concerns of families of the hostages of people I spoke to even from her own kibbutz
*04:04.380- 04:09.080* :  and she said there were clean toilets. She said that they were given food, cheese and cucumber,
*04:09.080- 04:16.720* :  sandwiches. Each of the hostages had a guard. She spoke of her hope that all hostages will be freed.
*04:16.720- 04:23.660* :  Unfortunately she didn't have news of her own husband who remains along with the husband of the
*04:23.660- 04:29.480* :  other woman that she was released with in Gaza among those more than 200 people still being held.
*04:29.980- 04:35.000* :  Earlier we had Sharon Lipshit saying to us that he was very involved in rights of Palestinians
*04:35.000- 04:40.360* :  working towards peace with our neighbours. She introduced both of her parents and we saw that
*04:40.360- 04:47.020* :  in this news conference as real sort of peace activists. Did any details emerge from what
*04:47.020- 04:52.780* :  Yokeved Lipshits was saying about where exactly she was held? I mean was she held in tunnels
*04:52.780- 04:58.920* :  underground? Any evidence of that? Yes. She talked about how they were taken into the tunnels
*04:58.920- 05:04.240* :  quite early on. Of course then it was disorienting. She hasn't really got a clue of exactly where
*05:04.660- 05:09.160* :  she was held within the Gaza Strip. But she did describe being taken to a large hall
*05:09.160- 05:14.900* :  before the group was split up. So it gives you an idea of just the sophistication in this tunnel
*05:14.900- 05:20.680* :  network that exists underneath Gaza that the Israeli military has been talking about so much as
*05:20.680- 05:26.820* :  saying that this is used as a command and control centre by the armed factions in the Gaza Strip
*05:26.820- 05:32.880* :  that leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad are believed to be hiding in these locations and these
*05:32.880- 05:38.380* :  tunnels have also been extremely important for these groups as they have carried out these attacks
*05:38.380- 05:43.960* :  against Israeli civilians and soldiers. Another point of Yokeved Lipshit said she did receive
*05:44.060- 05:51.080* :  some medical care while she was being held. But really now it's not clear what happens to the
*05:51.080- 05:56.100* :  other hostages, especially with this very intense Israeli bombardment that has been continuing in
*05:56.100- 06:00.800* :  the Gaza Strip. There's a lot of concern from families of the hostages when we've spoken to them
*06:01.220- 06:06.920* :  of course about their safety during that bombardment as well of course as the safety of Palestinians
*06:06.920- 06:13.040* :  themselves. Yolandael, well for those desperate for news the release of two more hostages,
*06:13.400- 06:19.260* :  may have provided a glimmer of hope. Al-Basorai's sister, Yonat Orr and her husband and two of
*06:19.260- 06:25.480* :  their children aged 12 and 15 were abducted from Kibbutz Berry. Mr. Basorai, a British lawyer,
*06:25.480- 06:31.400* :  learned his sister had been killed but believes the others are in Gaza. Sarah Montague asked
*06:31.400- 06:38.500* :  about his reaction to news of the released hostages. It's very difficult you know it's you know I cannot
*06:38.500- 06:45.380* :  stop thinking maybe this is some sort of psychological game by Hamas you know with our feelings and with
*06:45.380- 06:51.740* :  our fears but yes it's true that there is some hope that you know if they released them maybe
*06:51.740- 06:58.740* :  they would be inclined to release at least uninvolved people you know the children the women
*06:59.660- 07:08.260* :  yes so it does give some hope but qualified one if I may say so. I mean you had the news that
*07:08.260- 07:14.080* :  sad news that your sister was killed have you had any information about her husband and
*07:14.880- 07:24.660* :  their three children? No so someone saw the whole family been pulled out by Hamas terrorists
*07:25.620- 07:32.500* :  out of the home on Saturday morning then we so we assumed they were kidnapped then you know my
*07:32.500- 07:38.340* :  sister's phone was traced to Gaza so this maybe gave us another hope that you know they're all
*07:39.200- 07:46.480* :  in Gaza I had to look through all the Hamas horrible videos you know on the various channels you know
*07:46.480- 07:52.180* :  just to try and trace or see if I can get a glimpse of any of them which I couldn't but I saw
*07:52.920- 08:00.320* :  enormous amount of atrocities and evilness and you know it's just beyond beyond imagination so apart
*08:00.320- 08:07.000* :  from the fact from these two facts you know we have no other confirmation but they are considered
*08:07.000- 08:14.860* :  hostages by the Israeli authorities. Hamas talks about civilians and there seems to be a
*08:14.860- 08:21.040* :  suggestion that the civilians are more likely to be released than soldiers was your sister's husband
*08:21.040- 08:28.300* :  draw was he in the army? It was in the army everybody in Israel at one stage is in the army but he's
*08:28.300- 08:34.140* :  not a soldier you know is a civilian once you finish your military service you go and you know
*08:34.640- 08:40.400* :  go back to your civilian life and there's no involvement in the military or anything of this nature
*08:40.400- 08:46.180* :  so yeah they can make this distinction but you know it's very artificially it was not in uniforms or
*08:46.180- 08:53.440* :  or a soldier as such when he was captured and the it's such a it's a hard question but you must
*08:53.440- 09:02.400* :  have imagined how they are coping with with this you know so I to be honest with you I don't run
*09:02.400- 09:07.360* :  scenarios in my head of this of this sort you know because really it's at the end of the day it's
*09:07.360- 09:13.280* :  only in my head and what it does it just gets me into very dark places which I refuse to go into
*09:13.320- 09:20.400* :  you know so I rather stay on the side of hope I had the you know believe that they are okay and
*09:20.400- 09:27.200* :  looked after and hopefully will be released. One of the women who was released overnight we saw
*09:27.200- 09:32.800* :  extraordinary images of her turning back to hold the hand of one of her captors and she describes
*09:32.800- 09:40.100* :  that they were treated well I just wondered when you heard when you saw that and when you heard what
*09:40.100- 09:47.080* :  she said how you felt. You know it's mixed feelings you know because I saw you know I'm originally
*09:47.080- 09:52.420* :  from Kibud's Bay area I was born then was raised up there so you know I saw the atrocities you know
*09:53.580- 09:59.680* :  horrible scenes you know and stories that emerged from what her master is didn't bury so you
*09:59.680- 10:07.160* :  know I take this with such scenes with a grain of salt and think to myself it's some sort of a
*10:07.560- 10:14.160* :  vicious propaganda you know to try to masquerade you know the atrocious thing so you know I'm I'm
*10:14.680- 10:20.260* :  I think it's nice and I think it's beautiful to see humanity you know this but I cannot
*10:20.760- 10:25.860* :  get out of my head the images of the atrocities I just can't. Ahal Basora who's family are
*10:25.860- 10:31.800* :  abducted from Kibud's by Hamas speaking there to Sarah Montague meanwhile Israel has kept
*10:31.800- 10:39.020* :  up its bombardment of Gaza Hamas health officials say an estimated 700 people have been killed by
*10:39.020- 10:45.040* :  Israeli airstrikes in the past 24 hours. Rushdie Abu Aluf is in the city of Khan units in the
*10:45.040- 10:50.380* :  south of the Gaza Strip where he relocated with his family from Gaza City. After a
*10:50.380- 10:57.700* :  like four hours pause and announced ceasefire last night after midnight Israeli intensifier strikes
*10:57.700- 11:04.380* :  here in South area and so called safe areas this morning I've been to the funeral of the family
*11:04.380- 11:10.420* :  about 13 member of the same family was very angry mood sadness people screaming crying
*11:10.420- 11:18.240* :  I saw injured woman coming to pay a tribute to her son who was killed in the airstrike last night
*11:18.540- 11:25.440* :  that anger that you're seeing is of course going to be directed at those who are striking
*11:26.200- 11:33.220* :  guards are at the moment of Israel is there any of that anger quietly in private against Hamas
*11:33.340- 11:39.680* :  forgetting them into this situation well to be honest yes there is but people are too traumatized
*11:39.680- 11:44.520* :  even to think of what's going on around them people are trying to survive you know when you
*11:44.520- 11:49.760* :  when you don't have water and you do to have food your priority is to find a little water so
*11:49.760- 11:55.940* :  your kids are not dying from thirst you know but yes there is a level of anger I saw a woman in
*11:55.940- 12:01.680* :  the hospital yesterday she was screaming following the death of her family she was blaming Hamas
*12:01.680- 12:07.080* :  she said why you have done that but all the people shouting in funeral against Israel
*12:07.080- 12:13.360* :  this to Israel they blame the Arab as well most of the people who have been speaking to asking where
*12:13.360- 12:20.200* :  is the Arab why the Arab are normalizing relation with Israel rusty Abu al-Aluf speaking to Nick
*12:20.200- 12:26.880* :  Robinson Ukraine says Russian forces are making concerted efforts to cut off a vital supply road
*12:26.880- 12:33.720* :  to a strategically important town in the ninesk region the Ukrainians say Avdivka is under almost
*12:33.720- 12:39.720* :  incessant bombardment last night president Zelensky picked out the defenders of Avdivka for a special
*12:39.720- 12:45.240* :  praise describing their resilience as a strength for the whole country I corresponded to any hills
*12:45.240- 12:53.960* :  been speaking to some of those trying to survive in a town on the front line I can't sleep at night
*12:54.780- 13:02.600* :  missiles are offline every night all day and night there aren't many people left in Avdivka
*13:03.580- 13:11.740* :  everyone feels fear that's why Marina wants to get out to the towns under near constant attack by
*13:11.740- 13:22.880* :  Russian forces she spoke to her spy phone from a shelter around 1500 people are still here they
*13:22.880- 13:32.920* :  leave here most of them are old they stay here because some of them are ill they are old where can
*13:32.920- 13:41.740* :  they go Moscow wants Avdivka badly it's close to the city of Donetsk which Russia and its proxy
*13:41.740- 13:49.140* :  forces have occupied since 2014 seizing Avdivka would make it much harder for Ukraine to take it back
*13:52.700- 13:58.260* :  the situation in the town in New Years villages has changed a lot in the last few weeks
*14:00.100- 14:06.640* :  Anadi Yudin is part of a police unit known as the white angels they get people to safety but it's
*14:06.640- 14:20.040* :  getting more dangerous there are constant attacks on town and villages launched from either artillery
*14:20.040- 14:27.440* :  multiple rocket launchers or aviation guided area bombs missiles they attack where people
*14:27.440- 14:37.980* :  leave over the past week we evacuated 50 people not everyone wants to leave not everyone can
*14:37.980- 14:43.320* :  we spoke to Hannah who's desperate to escape but her elderly mother refuses to go
*14:43.580- 14:53.440* :  I cannot leave her she's always 70 and has problems with her legs if she stays alone she cannot
*14:53.440- 15:00.600* :  get water or wood for heating she said she wouldn't go anywhere and that she wanted to sleep in
*15:00.600- 15:09.120* :  her own bed windows and doors are broken everywhere it's difficult to fix them with daily attacks
*15:09.120- 15:15.460* :  because they get broken again every day there are no shops left anymore the last one got hit
*15:15.460- 15:24.440* :  today the people we spoke to in Avdivka described the most appalling of living conditions but they
*15:24.440- 15:30.520* :  recalled for us too how life used to be before war devastated their town his mariner again
*15:31.960- 15:39.700* :  there was a park a moon barred there were a lot of shops we planted trees it was very beautiful here
*15:39.980- 15:43.820* :  we had a culture center a lot of festivals and celebrations
*15:45.840- 15:50.460* :  she hopes one day to return but fears there'll be nothing left to come back to
*15:51.340- 16:00.020* :  there is no Avdivka anymore a resident of Avdivka marina ending that report from Jenny Hill in Ukraine
*16:03.160- 16:09.520* :  still to come on the podcast a deadly pile-up caused by a so-called super fog in the U.S. state of
*16:09.520- 16:16.700* :  Louisiana she calls me mama they they've had a bad wreck and we're in it but we're okay

*16:29.360- 16:35.720* :  thought for letters of advice things that can inform you can guide you can support you
*16:35.940- 16:41.620* :  it's a handbook to life for daughters everywhere i want her to know from the time she's very young

*16:49.000- 16:53.760* :  such for dear daughter wherever you get your BBC podcast dear daughter
*16:58.840- 17:04.000* :  in South Africa more than 500 mineworkers are still underground more than a day after they
*17:04.000- 17:09.700* :  expect to emerge from a shift which began on Sunday night some reports suggest an illegal
*17:09.700- 17:15.540* :  sit-in but it's unclear if everyone is involved or some are being prevented from leaving the one
*17:15.540- 17:21.760* :  gold-moder east mine in springs east of Johannesburg outside the mine people have brought food and
*17:21.760- 17:28.320* :  water to send to the men underground the cause appears to be a dispute between two unions as our
*17:28.320- 17:35.560* :  correspondent Nomsomaseko explains there is currently a meeting underway by the mine bosses and
*17:35.560- 17:41.940* :  representatives of the national union of mineworkers and the association of mineworkers and construction
*17:41.980- 17:49.220* :  union from what we can understand it is alleged that the mine is only willing to recognize the
*17:49.220- 17:59.040* :  national union of mineworkers which has the a minority of of mineworkers who are the members however
*17:59.040- 18:06.640* :  the association of mineworkers and construction union claims that more than 1,700 employees
*18:06.700- 18:14.960* :  of the mine belong to them and that the the mine itself is refusing to recognize the union
*18:14.960- 18:22.280* :  which is why we are seeing this current situation at the moment it appears that it is not a
*18:22.280- 18:29.780* :  hostage situation per se but that the majority of the night shift workers who were underground
*18:29.780- 18:36.820* :  had planned this sit-in however not all of them who are underground belong to the one union which
*18:36.820- 18:42.740* :  is why there are claims that those who want to come out you know to the surface are being held
*18:42.740- 18:49.760* :  against they will Nomsomaseko a study of former rugby players brains has produced fresh evidence
*18:49.760- 18:56.620* :  of the effect that repeated head injuries can have on players of high impact contact sports
*18:56.620- 19:03.940* :  a health reporter Philippa Roxby told me more it's a small study of the brains of 31 dead players
*19:03.940- 19:08.700* :  who denated their brains to medical research and it was led by the University of Glasgow
*19:09.100- 19:13.400* :  and they analyzed those brains these were all regular rugby players some were professional
*19:13.400- 19:18.640* :  but most were club players and they had an average of 18 years playing the game and they found
*19:18.640- 19:23.760* :  that two thirds of those brains showed signs of something called CTE it's a brain condition called
*19:23.760- 19:29.780* :  chronic traumatic encephalopathy and it's linked to repeated head injuries you know it's something
*19:29.780- 19:34.480* :  you don't get with one head injury but it's repeated over years and years and years and so this
*19:34.480- 19:39.140* :  is a sign that they found in other contact sports as well like American football in in players
*19:39.140- 19:44.980* :  brains and they also discovered that the longer though that person's career went on for the more
*19:44.980- 19:50.960* :  likely they were to have this in their brain so a real indication that it's those repeated
*19:50.960- 19:57.120* :  injuries over many many years that can cause this brain damage and this looked specifically at
*19:57.120- 20:01.880* :  rugby players interesting is that the rugby world cup is going on and you can see how actually
*20:01.880- 20:07.720* :  brutal it is when you watch it yes not just about rugby is it no I mean there's many other sports
*20:07.720- 20:13.520* :  that are implicated now that are being looked into even football are looking at cases of potential
*20:13.520- 20:19.500* :  dementia linked with the heading of the ball American football was was one of the first sports
*20:19.820- 20:27.200* :  to to find signs of CTE in in former players brains and also boxing has long been researched
*20:27.200- 20:33.080* :  as a cause of of brain damage and so there are calls for for all these contact sports to try and
*20:33.080- 20:39.760* :  reduce head impacts and brain impacts the researcher on this study actually compared the brain to
*20:39.760- 20:46.080* :  a spinning bowl of porridge with the brain the porridge and when the the head gets hit in a in a
*20:46.080- 20:51.440* :  terrible impact then the the bowl spins around and the porridge in it also spins and that is
*20:51.500- 20:57.480* :  that's causing these tiny little impacts which over time build up into this into this degenerative
*20:57.480- 21:03.640* :  brain condition and that's what they believe happens Philippa Roxby the world is on an unstoppable
*21:03.640- 21:10.380* :  shift towards renewable energy but needs faster action to phase out fossil fuels if it's to halt the
*21:10.380- 21:17.560* :  slide to a critical 1.5 degree rise in temperatures that's the gist of a new report from the international
*21:17.560- 21:24.480* :  energy agency which predicts that by 2030 renewables will be providing half of the world's electricity
*21:24.780- 21:29.920* :  a climate reporter Esmi Stallard gave me the details it says it's been a phenomenal rising
*21:29.960- 21:34.740* :  in clean energy and there's one statistic in the report where he stuck out to me which kind of
*21:34.740- 21:41.480* :  summarises this hope and progress we've made just three years ago one in 25 cars sold were electric
*21:41.480- 21:47.240* :  and now that is one in five which is staggering and that's just from current policies there are
*21:47.280- 21:52.940* :  also many targets the governments have committed to which the international energy agency the IEA
*21:52.940- 21:58.760* :  thinks will only accelerate this further in fact Fatil Burrell who is the executive director of
*21:58.760- 22:04.420* :  the agency said the transition to clean energy is not a question of if but how soon and I think
*22:04.420- 22:09.620* :  that sums up quite nicely the essence of this report but there are serious challenges to be
*22:09.620- 22:15.420* :  faced aren't there I mean emissions are still too high yeah the report points out the vast
*22:15.420- 22:20.440* :  renewable energy is contained to grow the investment of fossil fuels is still too high it's about
*22:20.440- 22:26.580* :  double where it should be if we want to achieve that goal of net zero emissions the report looks at
*22:26.580- 22:31.400* :  the climate commitments made by countries and says if all of those are implemented the world
*22:31.400- 22:36.300* :  are still on track for temperatures to rise by about 2.4 degrees above pre-industrial times
*22:36.320- 22:42.020* :  and we've spoken before in this program that countries pledged back in 2015 at that Paris climate
*22:42.020- 22:47.200* :  summit to try and keep temperature rise to below 1.5 to avoid the very worst impacts of climate
*22:47.200- 22:53.320* :  change so we're still some way off from that target at the moment and does it criticise governments
*22:53.420- 22:58.000* :  it praises some of the policies that are in place but there is sort of a thinly veiled criticism
*22:58.000- 23:03.740* :  I would say of countries that are still opening new oil fields on the basis of energy security
*23:03.740- 23:08.220* :  the report says that doesn't actually offer energy security at all and that argument is quite
*23:08.220- 23:14.440* :  weak really if anything investing in renewable energy is going to provide that stability and it's
*23:14.440- 23:20.000* :  also warning isn't it about the effect of geopolitics and warning about the threat of something
*23:20.000- 23:25.300* :  we've been covering on the program of course the conflict in the Middle East they're saying it's
*23:25.300- 23:30.640* :  not yet clear how and to what extent these geopolitical tensions could influence world energy
*23:30.640- 23:36.740* :  markets but they've drawn parallels with the 1973 oil crisis so when a group of Arab nations
*23:36.740- 23:42.320* :  took the decision to place an embargo on oil exports to certain countries like the US
*23:42.320- 23:48.020* :  Canada and the UK are for the provider support to Israel in the young people war against Arab
*23:48.020- 23:53.720* :  states led by Egypt and Syria and that resulted in fuel prices skyrocketing and also ramping
*23:53.720- 23:59.220* :  inflation but the report also points out the world is now better prepared for those disruption
*23:59.240- 24:04.980* :  to supplies because of how embedded renewable energy now is and if we just continue to expand
*24:04.980- 24:10.620* :  that clean energy it will help us protect against this volatility that we do get when political
*24:10.620- 24:16.800* :  tensions rise up as is the case with the Middle East or as we saw previously and ongoing with the
*24:16.800- 24:23.180* :  Russian invasion of Ukraine. Esme Stalad seven people have been killed in the US state of Louisiana
*24:23.180- 24:31.000* :  after what's known as super fog led to a huge pile-up involving 158 cars. Others are injured
*24:31.000- 24:35.260* :  and locals will be asked to donate to blood banks as Charlotte Gallica reports.
*24:40.120- 24:46.300* :  Videos from the scene in New Orleans show burnt out mangled cars piled on top of each other
*24:46.720- 24:51.640* :  at least one vehicle careered off the road landing in a lake beneath the highway.
*24:52.320- 24:57.820* :  A fire broke out after the crash and a tanker which was carrying hazardous liquid was removed.
*24:58.580- 25:04.520* :  Seven people are known to have died but police say that figure may rise as the area is still being
*25:04.520- 25:10.940* :  searched. 25 people are injured, some critically. State police are urging anyone with a missing
*25:10.940- 25:16.940* :  family member or friend to contact them. This woman told CBS News her daughter had been involved
*25:16.940- 25:24.040* :  in the pile-up. She calls me mama they've had a bad wreck and we're in it but we're okay.
*25:24.480- 25:30.400* :  A super fog had descended on the highway before the crash, reducing visibility to less than three
*25:30.400- 25:36.180* :  meters. According to the US National Weather Service, super fogs occur when a mixture of smoke
*25:36.180- 25:42.540* :  and moisture released from damp, smoldering organic material such as leaves and trees mixes with
*25:42.540- 25:48.240* :  cooler, nearly saturated air. The weather phenomenon has caused car pile-ups in the past.
*25:49.060- 25:55.240* :  Charlotte Gallica and finally to what has been described as a cautionary tale about fame,
*25:55.240- 26:01.220* :  family and betrayal. It's the newly published autobiography of one of the most famous women in
*26:01.220- 26:07.100* :  the pop world, Britney Spears. Just a few years ago it would have been impossible for the singer to
*26:07.100- 26:12.420* :  do that as she lived under a conservatorship that stripped her of some basic human rights.
*26:13.060- 26:19.640* :  That court-imposed order, overseen by her father, was lifted back in 2021 when a judge ruled
*26:19.640- 26:25.980* :  that Britney Spears could again make her own decisions. Our music correspondent Mark Savage has read
*26:25.980- 26:32.380* :  her new book. In 2008, as we all know, there was the incident where she shaved her head. She was
*26:32.380- 26:37.260* :  suffering, she says, in the book, from postpartum depression, an aunt who was very close to her had
*26:37.260- 26:41.460* :  died. There was a custody battle with her first husband, her second husband, actually, Kevin
*26:41.460- 26:50.360* :  Federline, over those two young sons, Sean and Jaden. I think she was, in some respects, not coping
*26:50.360- 26:56.800* :  well, and there was, in the first instance, potentially, a justification for removing some
*26:56.800- 27:01.920* :  element of control from her life just to get her back on the tracks. It's very unusual, as we
*27:01.920- 27:08.200* :  heard when the conservatorship ended, for it to last 13 years, and she, in the book, is incredibly
*27:08.200- 27:15.820* :  angry about that. She is adamant that she will never see her family again. She has not shown them
*27:15.820- 27:20.720* :  the book in advance, and her father, in particular, who was the one that, for most of that period,
*27:20.720- 27:26.180* :  was in charge of her finances, her personal life, all decisions about who she could date or where
*27:26.180- 27:31.260* :  she went out or what concert she did. She reserves the most vitriol for him. She calls him reckless,
*27:31.840- 27:38.080* :  cruel. She accuses him of being an alcoholic, a failed businessman, and has cut him out of
*27:38.080- 27:42.120* :  her life completely. Yet, through all this, she was still making music and performing.
*27:42.120- 27:47.500* :  Yes, a four-year Las Vegas residency. And one of the things that comes across, there was a point
*27:47.500- 27:51.560* :  where she was in rehearsals for that, and she wanted to change a dance step. There was something
*27:51.600- 27:55.740* :  in there that she felt was too complicated, that she could have done when she was younger, and
*27:55.740- 28:00.560* :  they pulled her aside, she says, and accused her of being difficult, and put her on lithium tablets,
*28:01.200- 28:06.620* :  which, of course, isn't an incredibly strong anti-depressant. And that terrified her because,
*28:06.620- 28:13.020* :  as she says, in the book, one of her grandmothers had been put on lithium and ended up committing
*28:13.020- 28:22.040* :  suicide. And so the echoes of that coursed through her. She was scared by the signs of it for a lot
*28:22.040- 28:28.960* :  of that time. Mark Savage on Britney Spears. And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new
