*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:17.200* :  by advertising. This is a Global News Podcast special from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.120- 00:22.780* :  I'm Jackie Leonard in London and this is our second special edition with
*00:22.780- 00:27.760* :  listener's questions on what's going on in Israel and Gaza. We're recording this podcast at
*00:27.760- 00:35.980* :  1730 GMT on Friday the 20th of October. With us to provide some answers, clarity and context
*00:35.980- 00:41.500* :  is leaves do set in southern Israel. She is the BBC's chief international correspondent
*00:41.500- 00:48.280* :  and also hosts the conflict podcast and in Jerusalem we have Jeremy Bowen, our international editor.
*00:48.820- 00:51.300* :  There is a lot to talk about, so let's get started.
*00:54.640- 00:59.840* :  We don't know how events in Gaza and Israel will unfold in the coming hours, much less days,
*00:59.840- 01:05.640* :  but as soon as Hamas attacked on October the 7th, there was no doubt that Israel would respond.
*01:06.320- 01:10.880* :  So let's start with this question. Hello, this is David from Sydney, Australia.
*01:11.780- 01:16.360* :  Given that Hamas would have known their barbaric attack would result in a massive reaction,
*01:17.540- 01:23.720* :  why did they do it? Was it to provoke an overreaction? Would lose Israel the support of its allies?
*01:24.260- 01:30.240* :  And Liz will come to you for that one. I think you'd have to look at a very broad canvas to get
*01:30.240- 01:34.660* :  the reasons why they would have done it. They wanted to get the attention of the world, they did that.
*01:35.480- 01:41.600* :  It was a time in which the Palestinian question was largely forgotten, including Gaza,
*01:42.420- 01:46.700* :  where Arab states who quite frankly have always let the Palestinians down.
*01:47.500- 01:52.180* :  We're looking to make deals with Israel or in some cases like Saudi Arabia, there were
*01:52.180- 02:00.180* :  negotiations with Israel. And we do know when I had spoken recently actually to some mediating
*02:00.180- 02:06.300* :  groups who for years had been talking to Hamas leaders, trying to move them away from the gun,
*02:07.500- 02:12.200* :  how they had found that whenever they tried to approach Western governments, the United States,
*02:12.220- 02:17.440* :  they were always rebuffed. And so there was a feeling that whatever they tried,
*02:18.540- 02:24.460* :  simply wasn't working. So one political leader of Hamas was saying, well, it was out of
*02:24.540- 02:33.040* :  despair and frustration that every door was shut and so we basically knocked down, kicked down
*02:33.100- 02:38.980* :  another very big door. And Jeremy, the next question is for you. Hello, my name is Emily,
*02:38.980- 02:45.780* :  I'm calling from Australia and I'm curious to know when the Palestinians in Gaza hear about
*02:45.820- 02:51.800* :  the atrocities, not just the numbers, but actually what happened, what do they think?
*02:52.580- 02:56.340* :  Hi, my name is Reggie, I live in Perry, Georgia, south of Atlanta.
*02:56.680- 03:00.860* :  How do the people of Gaza feel about Hamas at this point? Are they angry towards them for
*03:00.860- 03:06.480* :  provoking Israel? Is this pushing more towards radicalism? So Jeremy, what's your take on that?
*03:08.620- 03:13.640* :  Well, you know what? I'm not in Gaza and I can't get into Gaza, which is for as a journalist,
*03:13.640- 03:20.580* :  it's rather frustrating. So I could only go secondhand on this and based on other similar,
*03:20.580- 03:29.940* :  but not nearly as intense moments. I think that a lot of people in Gaza are not keen on Hamas.
*03:30.200- 03:35.560* :  I don't think they're following them blindly. I think that they regard the people who control
*03:35.560- 03:42.240* :  their lives as something they can't really do anything about. I think that the moment most people
*03:42.240- 03:48.800* :  will be very concerned about what Israel is doing, because I think a common feeling among Palestinians
*03:48.800- 03:56.660* :  is that yes, these events provoke a response, but I think Palestinians see it against the backdrop
*03:56.660- 04:03.060* :  of a long history, a history of occupation, a history they look back to, they what they call
*04:03.060- 04:10.740* :  the Nakba, the catastrophe when Israel was created in 1948 and nearly well more than 750,000 people
*04:10.740- 04:15.800* :  became refugees and many of their descendants are in Gaza. So it's against that wider context.
*04:15.800- 04:20.480* :  I think it's really a bad history and actually it's not just Palestinians who think like that.
*04:20.480- 04:26.960* :  I interviewed a man today who has his wife and three kids as hostages inside Gaza and I said to him
*04:26.960- 04:31.420* :  who do you blame? And he said, well, history really, the long history of the conflict.
*04:31.920- 04:36.340* :  Well, just as we were coming into the studio, we were hearing that Hamas had offered to release
*04:36.340- 04:41.160* :  some of the Israeli hostages. It's been holding in exchange for an immediate ceasefire.
*04:41.340- 04:44.900* :  I hope we will have some more on that in just a moment. First, there were a lot of people
*04:44.900- 04:49.140* :  are just really concerned about what's going on with the hostages. Here's a question on that.
*04:49.820- 04:57.800* :  Hi, BBC. My name is Tasman. I am from Gothenburg, Sweden. The question that I have is whether the
*04:57.800- 05:04.120* :  Israeli hostages in Gaza are still alive. Do we have any evidence that they're well and that
*05:04.120- 05:09.080* :  they're actually retrievable? So, Lee, let's hear your take on that. What can you tell us about
*05:09.080- 05:16.320* :  the hostages at this point? Well, we knew a bit about the hostages from the get-go because these
*05:16.320- 05:23.980* :  horrific images emerged of Hamas fighters pushing women, one graddling a baby and another toddler.
*05:23.980- 05:30.080* :  Old women described as holocaust survivors being pushed across the border, others being pushed
*05:30.080- 05:35.600* :  onto motorcycles. So, we saw their images and their families saw these images and you can
*05:35.600- 05:42.440* :  imagine their distress. Since they were dragged, swept, pulled across the border to Gaza,
*05:43.220- 05:49.560* :  we've seen at least one video of a young man who was killed in an airstrike. There was one of those
*05:50.520- 05:58.140* :  horrible hostage videos, 21-year-old Maya Shams, who said that she had had injuries, that they
*05:58.140- 06:04.260* :  had been treated, but she appealed for everyone to do whatever they could to release the hostages.
*06:04.900- 06:10.620* :  Aside from that, we heard nothing and the statements where Hamas offers to make a deal are from
*06:10.620- 06:15.640* :  Hamas political leaders. They're not from the people who are holding the hostages and their
*06:15.640- 06:20.280* :  statements. The military leaders has always been categorical that they're not going to bargain,
*06:20.280- 06:28.180* :  but as we speak, there are reports coming in that Hamas has agreed to let a woman and her
*06:28.180- 06:34.080* :  daughter, two American hostages, be freed on humanitarian grounds because they're said to be in
*06:34.080- 06:39.160* :  poor health. And of course, Hamas is saying, see, we're not the people that you portray us to be.
*06:39.700- 06:45.420* :  This is such a big human tragedy, but the politics of it is very cynical. These are bargaining chips
*06:45.420- 06:52.120* :  for Hamas. And for more on what's happening on the ground, in Gaza and Israel, do subscribe to
*06:52.120- 06:58.580* :  the global news podcast from the BBC World Service. Well, another area that is of continuing
*06:58.580- 07:03.980* :  interest to our listeners are some of the terms that are being used. It is a hugely sensitive area,
*07:03.980- 07:09.140* :  as we discussed last week. And it's important to be clear and to tread really carefully. So,
*07:09.140- 07:14.780* :  let's hear some more on that topic. Hi, I'm Brynie Mitchell from London. I've noticed people on
*07:14.780- 07:21.260* :  the BBC podcast using the word Jewish instead of Israeli a few times. I think there's a lot of
*07:21.260- 07:26.860* :  confusion about language here. Please can you explain the difference between being Israeli,
*07:27.020- 07:34.460* :  being Jewish and Zionism? And please, can you also explain the difference between being pro-Palestine
*07:34.520- 07:39.780* :  and pro-Hamas? And we'll split this question if you don't mind, Jeremy. Would you like to take the
*07:39.780- 07:48.160* :  first part on what it is to be Jewish Zionist Israeli? First of all, approximately 20% of the
*07:48.160- 07:55.700* :  population of Israel is not Jewish. So, if you say Israelis, it's not a synonym for Jewish. There
*07:55.700- 08:02.520* :  are Jewish Israelis and there are Palestinian Israelis. Zionism, it was the movement that originated
*08:02.520- 08:09.860* :  in Europe in the late 19th century to create a homeland for the Jews. It started with the first
*08:09.860- 08:15.940* :  world Zionist Congress in Switzerland in 1897, at which point the man who was organized,
*08:15.940- 08:22.640* :  a man called Herzl, said that they would have a state within 50 years. In fact, they had one in
*08:22.640- 08:29.380* :  1948, which was 51 years after that. And please, help us out with pro-Palestine and pro-Hamas,
*08:29.380- 08:34.400* :  and is there an overlap? Well, pro-Palestine, there is a very big community around the world that
*08:34.400- 08:39.400* :  is very pro-Palestine, and we see them developing all the time on university campuses. Now, a whole new
*08:39.400- 08:45.140* :  generation is very much pro-Palestine. They identify with their demand for a Palestinian state,
*08:45.140- 08:51.340* :  their historical demand for justice, or their right to return home on so many levels.
*08:51.920- 08:55.520* :  Palestine means different things to different people. It could be historical Palestine. It could
*08:55.520- 09:04.200* :  mean a Palestinian state. Pro-Hamas is to support a movement, which Hamas means an Islamic resistance
*09:04.200- 09:11.780* :  movement, which is a group backed by Iran, which as we've seen in the past few weeks has adapted,
*09:11.780- 09:18.280* :  has a military strategy, and much more now a hostage-taking strategy. So they're very different
*09:18.300- 09:23.440* :  to be pro-Palestine or to be pro-Hamas, which you can be pro-Hamas and pro-Palestine,
*09:23.900- 09:28.540* :  but it's not necessary that if you're pro-Palestine, you're pro-Hamas. In fact, you could be very
*09:28.780- 09:35.200* :  anti-Hamas. And there's been a lot of talk as well about the need for Israel to respond proportionately
*09:35.200- 09:39.940* :  and within the rules of international law. And we'll direct this question at you as well, if we can,
*09:39.940- 09:46.260* :  please. Is it justified to ask 20 lack people to wicket an area within 24 hours?
*09:46.980- 09:51.920* :  So the question, is it justified to ask so many people to wicket an area within 24 hours?
*09:52.800- 09:58.160* :  No, especially when you live in one of the most densely populated places on the planet,
*09:58.780- 10:05.920* :  and when you are under non-stop Israeli bombardment, and when the roads are strewn with glass and
*10:06.320- 10:12.480* :  large suites of your neighborhood or the next neighborhood have been reduced to rubble,
*10:12.980- 10:18.440* :  and when you're scared to go out of your house, no, the United Nations said it was a death sentence.
*10:18.440- 10:25.560* :  It would be very, very difficult, possibly impossible to even in a more developed country at peace.
*10:25.560- 10:31.740* :  Human rights groups criticized it. And Jeremy, can you address this next one, which comes from the US?
*10:32.900- 10:36.820* :  My name is Robbie Fox, and I live in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States.
*10:37.760- 10:43.520* :  Is there a comparison to be made as Israel turns Gaza into a ghetto just as the Nazis did to the Jews
*10:43.520- 10:49.860* :  in Poland in 1939, and should we expect better from the Israelis given the modern history?
*10:50.620- 10:59.440* :  Jeremy. No, I think it would be wholly wrong to compare the Israelis and the Nazis. The Nazis
*10:59.440- 11:08.880* :  had a program of mass extermination, and while Israel can be criticized quite heavily, and many people
*11:08.880- 11:16.480* :  would say quite reasonably for breaking international law, for perhaps they would deny it, but many
*11:16.480- 11:21.740* :  people would say not trying hard enough to fulfill their obligations or international law,
*11:22.280- 11:26.280* :  to preserve the lives of Palestinian civilians as they go about their military business.
*11:27.060- 11:35.680* :  And Israel can also be faulted for denying Palestinians independence over many years, for confiscating land,
*11:35.680- 11:42.380* :  for building settlements in defiance of international law. It would be wholly wrong to compare them
*11:42.380- 11:51.000* :  to the war crimes, crimes against humanity, the barbaric nature of the Nazi regime, which started
*11:51.000- 11:56.200* :  a war that killed what was it, 50, 60, 70 million people? Well, we did talk earlier about
*11:56.200- 12:04.120* :  Hamas' reasoning behind launching the October the 7th attack. Other listeners have been getting
*12:04.120- 12:10.740* :  in touch to ask what might be acceptable to Hamas now. Hi, this is Mehmet Topeli from Turkey.
*12:11.460- 12:17.660* :  What would be the demand of Hamas for ceasefire? Would it be enough for Hamas to accept border
*12:17.660- 12:23.700* :  lines that were agreed in 1967? If so, would Israel accept it as well?
*12:24.220- 12:29.240* :  At first of all, these just remind us what was actually agreed in 1967, and then if you don't
*12:29.240- 12:36.340* :  mind get to Mehmet's question. Well, people often refer to UN Resolution 242 in which after the
*12:36.340- 12:44.120* :  6th day war, Israel was called upon to leave all of the territories it had occupied during that time,
*12:44.140- 12:49.880* :  and that is the kind of ground zero for UN resolutions which haven't worked and have been
*12:49.880- 12:57.080* :  flagrically violated ever since, and it's a source of real irritation and anger for many
*12:57.080- 13:01.680* :  for decades since. During peace processes, or whenever there was something approaching,
*13:01.680- 13:07.860* :  they talked about returning to the 67 borders. Hamas, of course, has a founding charter in which
*13:07.860- 13:13.080* :  they talk about the destruction of the Jewish state, so not willing to accept any land for the Jewish
*13:13.080- 13:18.780* :  people. But in recent years, they have come up with documents. There has been a part of Hamas,
*13:18.780- 13:24.740* :  and partly working with Arab states like Qatar, working with their parties, trying to come up with
*13:25.380- 13:29.440* :  a different way of governing, because they can no longer be just the group of the gun,
*13:29.440- 13:34.140* :  because they are governing the Gaza Strip, at least they were trying to, and they've seen,
*13:34.260- 13:38.520* :  a few years ago, they did come up with a document which suggests that they were prepared to accept
*13:39.360- 13:44.220* :  a state on the 67 borders, but they also wanted the rights of Palestinians, including the right
*13:44.220- 13:50.560* :  of return to be accepted. But it's difficult now to talk about a united Hamas, there are certain
*13:50.560- 13:57.120* :  principles that they agree on, but given all that's happened recently, we're not sure exactly what
*13:57.120- 14:03.680* :  they would be satisfied with, in the first place, could take a long time for the members to go out
*14:03.680- 14:09.440* :  in this crisis, and many of Hamas's top political and military leaders will be killed, as part of
*14:09.440- 14:16.560* :  Israel's military operations, said to be about destroying Hamas. And Jeremy, following on from
*14:16.560- 14:22.580* :  that theme, this question comes from a listener in Israel. This is Joshua Elierson from Givat Adda
*14:22.580- 14:28.920* :  in Israel. My question is, what will it take for Hamas to remove its commitment to destroy the
*14:28.920- 14:35.680* :  state of Israel from its charter, and accept Israel as a legitimate neighbor to a Palestinian state?
*14:36.160- 14:43.020* :  Jeremy. Well, as they say, you know, it's hard to start from where we are,
*14:43.020- 14:50.260* :  because things have gone on the way that they have. If you could wind back time to when Hamas
*14:50.800- 14:57.900* :  won Palestinian elections in 2006 after a huge protest vote against their opponents in
*14:57.900- 15:05.840* :  Fata, who were seen as incompetent and corrupt correctly, by the voters, if then there had been
*15:05.840- 15:12.100* :  an attempt to talk to Hamas, you never know what might have happened at the time. There were
*15:12.100- 15:17.640* :  plenty of analysts who said that the powerful countries of the world were wrong to isolate Hamas,
*15:17.640- 15:23.460* :  but it was isolated. About that time, actually, I had a background meeting with a very senior
*15:23.460- 15:30.080* :  American who's still in a very important position over there, and he said, he said, look,
*15:30.300- 15:35.180* :  first thing we've got to do is turn over that election. It's the wrong result. We can't accept it.
*15:35.780- 15:43.300* :  So those are what ifs. The way things are right now, Israel is saying it wants to wipe Hamas off
*15:43.300- 15:48.080* :  the face of the earth. So I think that even if Hamas suddenly said, actually, we've changed
*15:48.080- 15:52.480* :  our minds, we would accept you. I don't know. Would they would Israel accept that? They probably
*15:52.480- 15:59.300* :  wouldn't believe them, I think. So I think that at the moment, this momentum of war is going to
*15:59.300- 16:06.440* :  have to play out. Then after that, you never know the shock of the casualties on both sides could be
*16:06.440- 16:10.800* :  the catalyst for a new beginning. It would take different kinds of leaders, probably, on both sides.
*16:11.320- 16:17.800* :  But eventually, there will have to be a political deal, because if there isn't, it means that people
*16:17.800- 16:22.940* :  on both sides, leaders on both sides will sentence their children and grandchildren to more of the
*16:22.940- 16:28.620* :  same. Jeremy, thank you. That was Jeremy Bowen, who has to leave us now to go and do other things,
*16:28.680- 16:35.260* :  but we will continue with our podcast with Lee's due set. Let's hear now about how the United
*16:35.260- 16:42.440* :  Nations is responding. Hello, this is Shamsit Kalot from India. I'm sending this voice note
*16:43.280- 16:48.860* :  with the hope that you could provide more information about the various United Nations resolutions
*16:48.980- 16:55.180* :  and responses to them from both Israel and Palestinians since the establishment of the state of
*16:55.180- 17:03.640* :  Israel. So can you talk us through that, Lee's? Well, at various times in Palestinian history and
*17:03.640- 17:10.100* :  Israeli history, the unit has taken on very different roads. There is a Palestinian agency,
*17:10.100- 17:17.120* :  was set up specifically to deal with Palestinian refugees called UNRA, United Nations Relief
*17:17.120- 17:21.860* :  and Works Agency. It still works with them to this day, because many of the people living
*17:21.860- 17:29.480* :  in the West Bank and in Gaza Strip are defined as refugees. They are the refugees of successive
*17:29.480- 17:35.800* :  wars, the 1948 war, 1967 war, and every time there's a military escalation or conflict, people
*17:35.800- 17:40.800* :  get pushed from their homes as we're seeing yet again. There has been United Nations
*17:40.800- 17:48.100* :  envoys to Israel and the Palestinian territories trying in some way to bring the two sides closer
*17:48.100- 17:54.500* :  together, obviously that hasn't worked. And there are those UN resolutions which come from
*17:54.500- 18:01.560* :  the world's top table, the UN Security Council beginning with UN resolution 242 in 1967,
*18:01.820- 18:08.580* :  in the wake of the six day war in which Israel occupied territory from neighboring Arab states.
*18:09.680- 18:14.380* :  And I'm afraid another war is still going on and there's an air raid siren and we do have to take
*18:14.380- 18:23.440* :  it seriously. We'll be back. Lee's has just come back. Are you okay to continue, Lee's? Is
*18:23.440- 18:28.420* :  everything safe? Yes, we're here a few thugs in the background, but we're in a place where there
*18:28.680- 18:33.400* :  are air raid sirens in Gaza that they don't get them. And we have a certain amount of time to
*18:33.400- 18:37.900* :  get to the shelter, because then we know we're safe and can come back. Looking further ahead,
*18:38.680- 18:44.100* :  how do we move on from here and what can we learn from the past? Here is a question from the US.
*18:44.940- 18:51.180* :  My name is Jean Paul Jones and I live in Los Angeles, California. I'm an American millennial
*18:51.480- 18:59.680* :  and have never known a time when the Middle East has been at peace. On your podcast, a recurring
*18:59.680- 19:07.060* :  talking point is that Israel and Palestine have been in conflict for seven decades. Was there ever
*19:07.060- 19:13.860* :  a time when that region was at peace? I also asked this because this region is even depicted
*19:14.500- 19:21.080* :  as an area of unrest in the Bible. Surely conflict in this region hasn't lasted since the
*19:21.080- 19:29.020* :  authorship of biblical text. Has it? Has it, Lee's? Well, since I'm not a biblical historian,
*19:29.080- 19:34.560* :  I'm just going to go back as far as the history that I've lived through and that was in the wake of
*19:34.560- 19:41.640* :  the Oslo Peace Accord signed with great celebration and ceremony on the White House lawn in 1993.
*19:41.640- 19:48.400* :  I moved to the region first to Jordan in 1994 and then to Jerusalem and that was a time where people
*19:49.240- 19:56.220* :  dared to believe in peace where we used to go to Ramallah in the West Bank along with Israeli friends
*19:56.300- 20:03.540* :  where menus in restaurants were in Hebrew as well as in Arabic where Israeli and Arab
*20:03.540- 20:11.880* :  businessmen made plans to set up industrial zones together where Palestinian and Israeli politicians
*20:11.880- 20:16.900* :  they got to know each other. Their children got to know each other. They dared to believe that the
*20:16.900- 20:21.980* :  next generation would be living in a time of peace. I wrote a former own correspondent about this
*20:21.980- 20:28.120* :  but Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader who returned from exile to Gaza, went to visit Singapore
*20:28.120- 20:34.540* :  and he talked about how Gaza would become the Singapore of the region with so much investment
*20:34.540- 20:41.060* :  and it was a very, very different time. People knew the Oslo Accords were not perfect. There are
*20:41.060- 20:47.820* :  many cynics at the time but there was that tantalizing possibility but sadly as we say the rest
*20:47.820- 20:53.600* :  is history. A spate of suicide bombings, the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the commander
*20:53.600- 21:01.180* :  Jordan peacemaker many believed that the peace process, the hopes for peace, died with him when he
*21:01.180- 21:07.960* :  was assassinated by a Jewish extremist who didn't like his peacemaking. Well let's bring it back to
*21:07.960- 21:14.820* :  the present and a couple more questions. Hello BBC, I am Edmund Chavez III from the Philippines.
*21:15.720- 21:22.640* :  I apologize for asking a most difficult question. How can Israel and Palestine have lasting peace?
*21:23.760- 21:27.580* :  And before you try to answer that one, Lee's, here's a suggestion from another listener.
*21:28.480- 21:36.420* :  My name is Claudia Nielsen and I'm based in Hartford in the UK. I am a psychotherapist and my work is
*21:36.420- 21:45.200* :  clients is yes to take the history and talk through their early life experience but my agreement
*21:45.860- 21:51.700* :  is about working with the situation in the here and now. The past will always be there
*21:52.620- 21:59.040* :  but what can they do within the circumstances they find themselves to bring about the change they
*21:59.040- 22:04.760* :  need in order to become the people they are meant to be, free of the shackles of Israel.
*22:05.820- 22:11.960* :  That is what I think needs to happen in the Middle East. Many mistakes are made true but what is
*22:11.960- 22:17.780* :  needed is to move forward from where we are today in order to build a better future for everyone.
*22:18.340- 22:24.780* :  So Lee's the biggest question. I would really love to agree with the psychotherapist that we could
*22:24.780- 22:33.780* :  all just put our baggage down and start a new but history is lived here not in the past but in the
*22:33.780- 22:39.700* :  present. I was really struck when I first moved to this region. How so many people still carry the
*22:39.700- 22:48.720* :  rusted keys of the homes that they had before 1948 and the independence war for Israel and when
*22:48.720- 22:54.880* :  I met people when I would say where you from or where is your home they would refer to where
*22:54.880- 23:01.280* :  their grandfather was born which was a village in the West Banker in Gaza and we now know in our time
*23:01.380- 23:08.040* :  there's a lot of medical scientific evidence about generational trauma that you live through the
*23:08.040- 23:14.100* :  trauma of your ancestors and this is very much being lived by Palestinians now when we hear
*23:14.800- 23:18.920* :  suggestions that why don't the godsons just move for a short time why don't they cross the border
*23:18.920- 23:24.420* :  and just set up camps in Egypt just a temporary tent or why don't they go to Jordan they know that
*23:24.420- 23:30.960* :  when they do that they will become refugees again. And the generational trauma of Israelis as well
*23:30.960- 23:38.680* :  has to be taken into account. Of course again we are having the the echoes of the Holocaust you
*23:38.680- 23:45.780* :  know so graphically when you have Holocaust survivors being taken as hostages by Hamas when you have
*23:45.780- 23:54.480* :  the president of Israel Isaac Herzog saying never have so many Jewish people died in a day since the
*23:54.480- 24:02.780* :  Holocaust again they live with that generational trauma they also live with the trauma of suicide
*24:02.780- 24:09.180* :  bombings that have taken the lives of loved ones they feel threatened and fearful by the Palestinians
*24:09.180- 24:15.780* :  next door that is why the talk of peace became the talk of separation yet each other out of their
*24:15.780- 24:21.520* :  lives and so if I was to answer the question how can Israelis and Palestinians be at peace in
*24:21.520- 24:27.100* :  some ways they just want what we all want they want to have a home where they feel safe
*24:27.960- 24:32.720* :  and neighborhood where their children can go to school they want to have control their own
*24:32.720- 24:37.880* :  lives not to have another country in the case of the Palestinians it's the Israelis in the case
*24:37.880- 24:42.720* :  of the Israelis they feel threatened by the Palestinians they don't feel safe and they certainly don't
*24:42.720- 24:49.820* :  feel safe now they want to be able to live their own lives for many people and many politicians
*24:50.060- 24:58.000* :  it was the two-state solution a Palestinian state side by side within Israeli state but here we are
*24:58.000- 25:05.300* :  in 2023 and Jewish settlements have expanded by so much that many now think that a two-state
*25:05.300- 25:10.460* :  solution is simply not possible there's not enough land for a continuous Palestinian state so
*25:10.460- 25:17.720* :  before this crisis erupted many were saying that it had to be a one-state solution a state for Jews
*25:17.720- 25:24.600* :  and Arabs and those living in the West Bank and Gaza but that brings up a whole set of other
*25:24.600- 25:30.980* :  problems people want a home and I think that's something everyone can understand
*25:32.080- 25:38.340* :  least thank you and that's it from this special edition of the global news podcast and the
