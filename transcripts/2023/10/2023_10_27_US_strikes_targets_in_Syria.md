*00:21.140- 00:23.560* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*00:23.900- 00:28.020* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation, we
*00:28.020- 00:31.280* :  decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
*00:31.560- 00:36.340* :  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a

*01:17.320- 01:22.480* :  I'm Nick Karaci and at 1400 GMT on the 27th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:23.060- 01:28.120* :  The US has carried out airstrikes in eastern Syria, raising questions as to whether the
*01:28.120- 01:31.220* :  Israel Hamas conflict is spreading to neighboring countries.
*01:31.900- 01:36.300* :  This is raising tension another notch in the region and it will be seen, despite what
*01:36.300- 01:38.280* :  the Pentagon says, it will be seen as connected.
*01:38.740- 01:44.300* :  Israel has carried out its second ground incursion into Gaza in as many days as the UN gets
*01:44.300- 01:46.260* :  ready to vote on calls for a ceasefire.
*01:46.700- 01:52.100* :  There's significant international pressure for Israel to either call a ceasefire or to reduce
*01:52.100- 01:54.260* :  the intensities of its operations.
*01:55.380- 02:00.440* :  And in the US, a manhunt is under way in Maine for a missing gunman who killed 18.
*02:03.440- 02:06.380* :  Also in this podcast, I think that Twitter is dying.
*02:06.380- 02:12.020* :  I think it's just dying right now and I don't think Twitter users like me want it to
*02:12.020- 02:14.940* :  die because it's become such a valuable resource for me.
*02:15.680- 02:20.480* :  It's been a turbulent year for Twitter, now X since Elon Musk's controversial takeover
*02:20.480- 02:21.980* :  but what's next for the platform?
*02:28.180- 02:33.200* :  The US has carried out airstrikes against two weapons and ammunition storage facilities
*02:33.200- 02:34.360* :  in eastern Syria.
*02:34.360- 02:37.240* :  It says we used by Iran's revolution regards.
*02:37.340- 02:41.500* :  The Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes were in response to recent attacks
*02:41.500- 02:46.100* :  on American bases in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups.
*02:46.540- 02:51.180* :  Ben Rhodes, a White House advisor who works closely with Barack Obama on Iranian and
*02:51.180- 02:55.180* :  Middle Eastern policy, says he's worried about a wider conflict growing.
*02:55.960- 02:59.880* :  I think what you're going to have is a tinderbox where things are flaring up in different places
*02:59.880- 03:04.440* :  and it might be southern Lebanon one day, it might be Syria another day, it might be Iraq,
*03:04.460- 03:05.200* :  it might be Yemen.
*03:05.420- 03:11.840* :  There's just a lot of risk here and a lot of capability across this region and so if you
*03:11.840- 03:16.540* :  continue to light that tinderbox on fire at some point it's going to catch.
*03:17.320- 03:21.740* :  For more on what happened, I've been speaking to the BBC's Middle East analyst Sebastia
*03:21.740- 03:22.100* :  Nasha.
*03:22.780- 03:29.260* :  The Pentagon has said that it was two fighter planes, two USF-16 fighter jets that carried
*03:29.260- 03:30.820* :  out the attacks on two facilities.
*03:30.820- 03:35.800* :  This is an area right up against the border of Syria with Iraq.
*03:35.800- 03:38.940* :  It's been a flashpoint for a very long time.
*03:38.940- 03:44.240* :  It was a flashpoint during the war against ISIS, both in Iraq and in Syria.
*03:45.240- 03:50.660* :  I mean, what the US I think is doing at the moment is really playing down the significance
*03:50.660- 03:55.480* :  of this particular strike, saying it was narrowly targeted, sort of business as usual rather
*03:55.520- 04:00.500* :  than saying that it's a major shift in its strategy across the region as well as out
*04:00.500- 04:01.260* :  of what's happening in Gaza.
*04:01.260- 04:06.120* :  But we do know that there have been reinforcements of US troops brought into the region some
*04:06.120- 04:12.160* :  900 troops have arrived and also from the early days of this conflict there was a deployment
*04:12.800- 04:19.020* :  of US warships in the region in preparation perhaps to deter Iran if it wanted to get
*04:19.020- 04:24.160* :  directly involved which still seems unlikely rather than using its proxies and also to protect
*04:24.160- 04:26.220* :  its troops who still remain in the region.
*04:26.660- 04:30.600* :  So how is this related, if it is indeed to what's going on in Israel and Gaza?
*04:30.940- 04:36.340* :  I think the relationship is pretty obvious really, I mean, although the US hasn't overstressed
*04:36.340- 04:41.100* :  it and hasn't said that Iran, as far as we know, has literally ordered these attacks.
*04:41.140- 04:48.080* :  But what we've seen is that the Iranian-backed militias both in Iraq and in Syria had not
*04:48.080- 04:53.040* :  carried out these sorts of drone strikes on the remaining US bases in those two countries.
*04:53.680- 04:59.180* :  For some months and now we've seen a big uptick, I mean, around 20 US troops have been injured
*04:59.180- 05:01.900* :  in these attacks, there have been at least 12 of them.
*05:02.560- 05:05.360* :  So it can't be a coincidence this is happening.
*05:05.360- 05:09.820* :  So whether they're operating these groups on their own initiative knowing that this is
*05:09.820- 05:15.340* :  what Iran would want and also to fulfill their role of trying to make things difficult
*05:15.640- 05:19.940* :  for other US in the region, I mean, there's no question at the moment.
*05:19.940- 05:21.980* :  But I mean, we're bound to see more of this happening.
*05:22.520- 05:27.920* :  And this is how Iran, if it gets more directly and more deeply involved in what's happening
*05:27.920- 05:32.100* :  in Gaza, will try to accomplish its objectives through these proxies.
*05:32.100- 05:34.860* :  I mean, we have them in Iraq, we have them in Syria, of course, we have them in Nazbullah.
*05:35.500- 05:40.060* :  On the northern Israeli border in Lebanon, in Yemen, the Houthi movement there,
*05:40.540- 05:45.900* :  they've been reported to have fired one or two missiles towards the region as well.
*05:46.400- 05:52.200* :  So I mean, this is a slowly building front, essentially, that Iran will be hoping
*05:52.340- 05:59.240* :  and will potentially be ordering, if necessary, to spread amongst its proxies across the region
*05:59.240- 06:01.200* :  as the situation in Gaza develops.
*06:02.080- 06:02.980* :  It's a bastion, Usher.
*06:03.360- 06:08.260* :  Israel says it's carried out its second ground incursion into the Gaza Strip in two days.
*06:08.640- 06:14.580* :  According to the Army, infantry and armoured units entered Eastern Gaza's city to target Hamas fighters.
*06:15.080- 06:19.100* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted a full offensive is coming.
*06:19.140- 06:24.020* :  The military operations into Gaza come as there's increasing international pressure
*06:24.020- 06:29.420* :  for aides to enter the territory as civilians suffer the consequences of war.
*06:29.580- 06:35.220* :  The UN General Assembly is also voting on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza later on Friday.
*06:35.220- 06:38.720* :  We'll have more on the crisis inside Gaza in a moment.
*06:38.780- 06:43.540* :  But first, our correspondent, we're a Davis, is in southern Israel and gave us the latest
*06:43.540- 06:45.560* :  on the Israeli incursion into Gaza.
*06:46.200- 06:50.720* :  It was a little bit smaller, according to the images that we've received from the Israeli Army,
*06:50.720- 06:53.220* :  than the bigger incursion of the night before.
*06:53.220- 06:59.240* :  Both of them say Israel have been preparing the ground for what is still expected to be a full-scale
*06:59.240- 07:05.140* :  invasion of Gaza in order to achieve this objective of defeating Hamas militarily altogether.
*07:05.140- 07:11.260* :  Of a night, we saw as few Israeli tanks in the middle of the Gaza Strip going in for a couple of
*07:11.260- 07:16.140* :  kilometers to attack a specific Hamas-related position, according to Israel.
*07:16.520- 07:21.720* :  Israel says its objective was achieved without any injuries to the Israelis and they quickly
*07:21.720- 07:28.460* :  withdrew. The previous night, a significantly greater number of Israeli tanks and bulldozers
*07:28.460- 07:34.280* :  were filmed going into the Gaza Strip, conducting military operations, but also appearing
*07:34.280- 07:39.520* :  to clear tracks or paths, perhaps knowing what is to come whenever that will come,
*07:39.520- 07:43.600* :  which is, of course, a full-scale invasion in order to achieve that objective.
*07:44.020- 07:48.180* :  And this could go on. It might be precipitating an imminent military invasion.
*07:48.180- 07:53.480* :  Of course, there's significant international pressure for Israel to either call a cease-fire
*07:53.800- 07:58.980* :  or to reduce the intensities of its operations because of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*07:58.980- 08:02.800* :  And the fact also, there are 220 hostages still being held in Gaza.
*08:03.160- 08:08.220* :  Why hasn't the invasion come yet? This onslaught by Hamas was on the 7th
*08:08.380- 08:12.700* :  of October. What's holding it up? It's a really good question and a question that many
*08:12.700- 08:17.000* :  Israelis who support their government's military objectives, even if they don't support
*08:17.000- 08:21.400* :  their government, and majority of Israelis have been supporting their military objectives
*08:21.400- 08:26.220* :  because of the severity of what happened, of course, when 1400 Israelis were killed by
*08:26.660- 08:29.880* :  Hamas gunmen when they came over the border as you say nearly three weeks ago.
*08:29.880- 08:35.080* :  I think the Israeli military has pretty quietly and made it clear that it is ready to go in,
*08:35.380- 08:39.460* :  but this is now a political question. Israel is covered on all of its borders,
*08:39.820- 08:44.700* :  especially in the north where Hezbollah is a serious threat. There are American ships
*08:45.240- 08:49.140* :  off the shore, warning Hezbollah in Lebanon and warning Iran not to get involved.
*08:49.680- 08:54.240* :  So militarily, I think Israel is just about ready to go. It has been so for about a week or so.
*08:54.360- 08:59.720* :  But Mr Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyahu has got political considerations, not least the situation
*08:59.720- 09:05.300* :  with the 220 hostages, of course, and there's increasing domestic pressure for him to perhaps
*09:05.380- 09:10.420* :  try and secure the release of the hostages rather than his military objective.
*09:11.500- 09:16.780* :  Since the killing of more than 1400 Israelis by Hamas in the October, the 7th attacks,
*09:16.780- 09:21.760* :  they've been stark warnings that Israel's military response is punishing the civilian population
*09:21.760- 09:26.660* :  of the Gaza Strip, the head of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees, says that
*09:26.660- 09:31.740* :  last remaining services it's providing in Gaza are collapsing. As Israel continues its siege
*09:31.740- 09:37.280* :  and bombardment, the Hamas run health ministry says 7,000 people have been killed since the conflict
*09:37.280- 09:43.820* :  began three weeks ago. Philippe Latterini from the UNRAR Agency described the aid that had managed
*09:43.820- 09:50.660* :  to get through to Gaza as crumbs. There have been intense negotiation and endless
*09:50.660- 10:00.340* :  shuttle diplomacy to open a new humanitarian supply line. So far, it has only resulted in a handful
*10:00.340- 10:09.520* :  of aid convoying. This will not reverse the fact that Gaza is being strangled. The people of Gaza
*10:09.620- 10:18.460* :  feel shunned, alienated and abandoned. Hospitals are either shut or under immense pressure due to
*10:18.460- 10:23.520* :  dwindling fuel supplies, resulting in pregnant women being forced to give birth in dangerous
*10:23.520- 10:29.660* :  conditions. The UN says there are approximately 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza caught up in the
*10:29.660- 10:35.920* :  conflict. One of them, a woman called Jamana, has made an audio diary of her experience going into
*10:35.920- 10:39.480* :  labor. She's been speaking to BBC Arabic's Dalia Heider.
*10:44.400- 10:51.020* :  Jamana and her four-year-old daughter Tulin, they're having a precious moment together.
*10:53.440- 10:59.800* :  The 25-year-old journalist who's lived her entire life in Gaza Strip is nine months pregnant.
*11:01.160- 11:08.980* :  Their lives are now punctuated by the sounds of distant blasts. Drones are a constant in the air.
*11:14.500- 11:19.280* :  Pregnant women like me must go out for walks, but because of the war I am not able to go out even
*11:19.280- 11:28.740* :  to buy food, so I have to walk inside the room. We have been without water for four days.
*11:29.920- 11:35.180* :  This evening the water returned, but it is so weak, a trickle.
*11:37.560- 11:38.860* :  Can you hear the sound of the drones?
*11:46.420- 11:54.540* :  My neighbor has begun, but I can't find anyone to take me to the hospital. Taxi drivers are scared to leave their homes,
*11:55.340- 11:57.920* :  and they won't send an ambulance for a woman giving birth.
*12:06.400- 12:11.840* :  I had to go to a hospital in the middle of the strip. It is much smaller and less equipped.
*12:13.580- 12:20.900* :  When I got there, a house next to the hospital was bombed. The sound was so loud,
*12:22.640- 12:24.460* :  I went to the maternity room in shock.
*12:32.000- 12:36.560* :  They put me in a room. Originally for two beds, and I was the third one.
*12:37.940- 12:43.160* :  Other women had given birth. One of them was on the sofa here, another on a mattress,
*12:43.780- 12:44.760* :  and another in the corridor.
*12:46.540- 12:52.700* :  There is a lot of fear inside me, because of the shelling everywhere.
*12:53.740- 13:00.100* :  I am scared when on the road, scared when in the hospital, besides the labour pain and the shelling,
*13:00.520- 13:03.120* :  all I could think about is to deliver my baby.
*13:06.760- 13:11.660* :  As I was giving birth, I was thinking how to survive with my baby,
*13:12.600- 13:15.360* :  with the bombardment everywhere inside the Gaza Strip.
*13:17.060- 13:23.480* :  In all of this, Jumana had managed to get a message to me that she was in labour at a lauda hospital.
*13:24.900- 13:31.460* :  But when I heard that Israel had given the hospital two hours to evacuate, I called her brother for an update.
*13:31.700- 13:35.560* :  Hello, my name is Ali.
*13:37.820- 13:40.220* :  I am Ali Haider, I am a mother in law.
*13:40.220- 13:47.000* :  It was some good news, a baby girl, Talia had been born on the evening of October 13th.
*13:50.620- 13:53.760* :  She looks like me and her dad and her older sister.
*13:55.320- 13:59.340* :  When she wakes up from sleep and cries, she brings me back to life again.
*14:04.680- 14:13.140* :  At last, a feel of normality at home again, Talia's grandfather cuddles the newborn while praying to Allah.
*14:15.200- 14:19.300* :  And as the new sisters finally meet face to face for the first time,
*14:22.480- 14:25.180* :  Jumana can only hope for more peaceful times.
*14:25.640- 14:27.460* :  At the end of the day.
*14:30.440- 14:34.840* :  Talia Haider, speaking to Jumana, who is in Gaza.
*14:36.880- 14:42.540* :  Next, the man hunt for a US Army reservist, suspected of murdering 18 people and injuring
*14:42.540- 14:48.200* :  13 others in a mass shooting in Maine, is into a second day. Police say Robert Card is armed
*14:48.200- 14:51.920* :  and dangerous, and they're asking people to shelter inside their homes for safety.
*14:51.920- 14:54.900* :  The search has been widened from New York to the Canadian border,
*14:55.400- 14:58.640* :  unorth America correspondent John Sudworth reports from Maine.
*14:59.380- 15:06.420* :  Maine is a state-on-edge. The streets deathly quiet as people in the town of Lewiston and the
*15:06.420- 15:11.580* :  surrounding areas heed the warning to shelter in place and lock their doors.
*15:14.900- 15:20.300* :  But for those involved in the urgent manhunt, it's a different picture. Outside the known
*15:20.300- 15:25.400* :  address of the Maine suspect, the 40-year-old former Army reservist Robert Card,
*15:26.000- 15:31.940* :  with helicopters circling overhead, police use loud halers to urge him to give himself up.
*15:35.700- 15:40.000* :  Robert, you're under arrest, they say. Come out with your hands in the air.
*15:42.980- 15:47.960* :  All of this is taking place in the full glare of the media spotlight.
*15:48.280- 15:55.100* :  100 possibly more camera crews and reporters lined up here and rolling live on the action.
*15:55.240- 16:00.840* :  There's something more than a little odd about it. The hype and hullabaloo will last only
*16:00.840- 16:06.980* :  as long as the news cycle, of course. Then we'll all pack up, leave this tragedy behind
*16:08.000- 16:15.560* :  until the next one. But perhaps America's deadlock over meaningful gun reform doesn't have
*16:15.560- 16:22.040* :  to last forever. Maine is a strong hunting and fishing state where even Democrat politicians,
*16:22.040- 16:28.180* :  like Congressman Jared Golden, have voted against the Biden administration's efforts to ban
*16:28.180- 16:34.040* :  military-grade assault weapons. Well now, in the light of what's happened, he's changed his mind.
*16:34.740- 16:40.520* :  I have opposed efforts to ban deadly weapons of war like the assault rifle we use to carry out
*16:40.520- 16:45.480* :  this crime. The time has now come for me to take responsibility for this failure,
*16:46.720- 16:51.900* :  which is why I now call on the United States Congress to ban assault rifles to the people of
*16:51.900- 16:58.500* :  Louis to my constituents throughout the Second District, to the families who lost loved ones,
*16:59.220- 17:05.980* :  and to those who have been harmed. I asked for forgiveness. But with the search of the suspect's
*17:05.980- 17:12.280* :  property, eventually proving fruitless, there is deep nervousness here. A few hundred meters
*17:12.280- 17:18.260* :  from where some of the shootings took place, I find local resident James Sosa. I do carry
*17:18.260- 17:23.040* :  in the constitutional carry, and I feel safer that way. And I know that people hear downstairs
*17:23.560- 17:28.020* :  know that I do, and they felt much safer last night because of it. I wouldn't have felt so safe
*17:28.020- 17:34.240* :  last night if I was not, you know, have my guns in ammo. I wouldn't have. But I, you know,
*17:34.620- 17:38.860* :  when it was time to actually wind down a little bit, I was able to go to sleep last night knowing that
*17:38.900- 17:44.920* :  I had that by my side. The fear on the streets of Lewiston highlights an irony if the gun
*17:44.920- 17:51.440* :  controlled debate more generally, the more guns appear to be a threat, the more some seek the
*17:51.440- 17:55.540* :  protection they believe they offer. The report from John Sudworth.
*17:58.860- 18:04.020* :  Coming up. Paul called me up and said he'd like to work on now and then. He put the bass on,
*18:04.020- 18:11.060* :  I put the drums on. The past meets the future, as the Beatles use AI to produce what's described
*18:11.060- 18:17.260* :  as their last song. And before we move on, here's Andrew Peach with news of this week's happy pod.
*18:17.800- 18:23.260* :  Yes, this week a study from Shanghai looking at how Tai Chi can help people with Parkinson's.
*18:23.540- 18:28.300* :  A tortoise called Frank found roaming in the spinach fields of British Columbia in Canada,
*18:28.840- 18:33.620* :  how the computer game football manager has helped the national side in the African nation of
*18:33.620- 18:39.980* :  Guinea-Bisau and the happiest person in the happiest country on earth. Finland, please join me for
*18:39.980- 18:45.720* :  half an hour of positive uplifting news stories in the happy pod available in this feed every Saturday.
*18:52.920- 18:58.900* :  The explanation is the podcast from the BBC World Service that goes beyond the spin,
*18:58.900- 19:06.520* :  exploring the important questions about long-running stories and the latest global news. An honest
*19:06.520- 19:14.380* :  explanation of the events shaping our lives. Search for the explanation wherever you get your BBC
*19:14.380- 19:23.860* :  podcast. The former Chinese Premier Lee Kachung has died of a heart attack at the age of 68.
*19:23.860- 19:28.920* :  In March, he stepped down as the second most powerful communist official after a decade and was
*19:28.920- 19:35.040* :  replaced by a close ally of President Xi Jinping. The government has said it deeply morns Mr Lee's
*19:35.080- 19:40.460* :  passing. A correspondent in Beijing Steve McDonald told me more about the former Chinese Premier.
*19:41.240- 19:49.180* :  The passing of Lee Kachung is causing a lot of sadness and shock here, not only because of
*19:49.180- 19:54.940* :  the nature of his death, that he died so suddenly having a heart attack that he was the number
*19:54.940- 20:03.320* :  two leader in this country just months ago. But it's what he represented, which really is a sort of
*20:03.320- 20:10.560* :  different approach to Xi Jinping. He's seen as a pragmatist, much more interested in economics
*20:10.560- 20:17.900* :  than ideology, someone who would criticize what was going on here, who would acknowledge the problems
*20:17.900- 20:23.140* :  that China faced in order to find solutions. It's a different way of approaching problems than
*20:23.140- 20:29.620* :  say those in the party who would say you never acknowledge any problems. You don't talk about
*20:29.620- 20:33.780* :  what's going wrong because, frankly, they don't trust the public with that.
*20:34.140- 20:39.140* :  Lee Kachung had a different approach to that. And of course, the most interesting thing is that
*20:39.140- 20:44.320* :  at one point he could have been the leader of the country. And so at the moment of his death,
*20:45.060- 20:51.080* :  some might be asking today, well, what might China have been like today had he been chosen instead
*20:51.080- 20:55.900* :  of Xi Jinping? Because he's a very different approach to that of the current leader.
*20:56.260- 21:01.340* :  We will never know an increasingly sideline towards the end of his career.
*21:02.320- 21:07.320* :  Yeah, he cut a pretty lonely figure in the Seven Man Polipiro Standing Committee,
*21:08.380- 21:13.320* :  because he was from another time. That's one reason. He was the last senior leader with
*21:13.320- 21:20.460* :  connections to the Hu Jintao era. Now we have everybody well and truly locked in with Xi Jinping and
*21:20.460- 21:25.060* :  his way of doing things. Whereas under the previous administration, it was kind of like a collective
*21:25.060- 21:32.520* :  leadership. And so, at various times, there's Lee Kachung, supposedly in charge of the economy.
*21:34.060- 21:39.620* :  One point famously saying that there should be more street vendors in the streets of the
*21:39.620- 21:45.960* :  big cities of China, as a means of kickstarting the economy, which had really struggled during
*21:45.960- 21:51.900* :  the COVID years. Well, within days of him saying that, the Beijing government made it very clear
*21:51.940- 21:56.520* :  that those street vendors were not going to be allowed to return here, even though the premier
*21:56.520- 22:01.260* :  has said this. And I think that just showed the limits of his power. He tried as best he could
*22:01.860- 22:09.280* :  to shape the country, but ultimately Xi Jinping's power is so great that it was hard for him to do.
*22:09.280- 22:15.820* :  I think many of the things he wanted to. How will President Xi likely react to the
*22:15.820- 22:25.480* :  passing of Lee Kachung? They don't want to generate public enthusiasm for Lee Kachung's way of
*22:25.480- 22:32.520* :  doing things. Certainly, if it would seem to conflict with Xi Jinping's much more ideological
*22:32.540- 22:38.180* :  approach. So on the one hand, they're going to speak about him and say, you know, great things he
*22:38.180- 22:45.440* :  did, but it could well be very low key as a means of maintaining things as they are right now.
*22:46.100- 22:51.580* :  Stephen McDonald in Beijing. Now, the Beatles are arguably the most famous band of all time.
*22:51.580- 22:56.940* :  And earlier this year, Paul McCartney revealed in a BBC interview that he'd been using AI to create
*22:56.940- 23:04.100* :  what he called the final Beatles song based on a 1970s demo tape by John Lennon. Well, that track
*23:04.100- 23:09.720* :  called Now and then is set to be released next week. Our music correspondent Mark Savage has more.
*23:14.100- 23:19.260* :  The Beatles have come together for one last time. Next week, the band will release what they are
*23:19.260- 23:28.020* :  calling their last song. The new single Now and then started life as a home recording by John
*23:28.020- 23:35.140* :  Lennon in the 1970s, but it was only finished last year. Paul McCartney, Ringo Star and Lennon's son
*23:35.140- 23:41.040* :  announced the track in a short trailer. When we lost John, we knew that it was really over.
*23:41.220- 23:47.340* :  Paul called me up and said he'd like to work on Now and then. He put the bass on, I put the drums on.
*23:47.480- 23:51.940* :  It's the last song that my dad and Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together.
*23:59.680- 24:05.300* :  Now and then originated on the same cassette that produced this new Beatles song in 1995,
*24:05.460- 24:12.140* :  but the audio was considered too damaged to be of use. Until now, new computer software,
*24:12.140- 24:16.700* :  trained on Lennon's voice, allowed the remaining Beatles to extract and refine his vocals.
*24:16.820- 24:23.340* :  The new recording also includes a guitar part that George Harrison played before his death in 2001.
*24:28.100- 24:32.900* :  It's been a long and winding road to get to this point, but now and then will premiere
*24:32.900- 24:42.540* :  all around the world next Thursday. Mark Savage with that report. It's been a year since Elon Musk
*24:42.540- 24:49.320* :  took control of Twitter now known as X after paying $44 billion. Some people say it's
*24:49.320- 24:54.700* :  freer and things can be said on the site that used to be banned while others feel it's now a
*24:54.700- 25:00.160* :  home for much more abuse and disinformation. Reporting from San Francisco, James Clayton.
*25:00.720- 25:07.380* :  The year ago Elon Musk famously, infamously, walked into Twitter holding a sink. Let that sink in
*25:07.380- 25:16.100* :  equipped before firing huge swathes of its staff. Like this group of employees who filmed their
*25:16.100- 25:25.040* :  last moments at the company. It was emblematic of his erratic leadership. He slept in the office,
*25:25.460- 25:31.260* :  changed Twitter's name to X, talked about fighting Mark Zuckerberg who launched a rival to Twitter
*25:31.260- 25:37.000* :  called Threads over the summer. I got a taste of that unpredictability when I messaged him to ask
*25:37.000- 25:41.900* :  him for an interview six months ago. A few hours later, he was telling me he'd appointed his dog
*25:41.900- 25:50.180* :  to run Twitter. But although some have left the platform, it has been remarkably resilient.
*25:50.180- 25:56.940* :  A year on, X, formerly known as Twitter, still exists. Threads, Mark Zuckerberg's rival,
*25:56.940- 26:03.400* :  has not been the Twitter killer that some have touted it to be. But it still has major problems.
*26:03.460- 26:09.600* :  Despite what Elon Musk says, independent analysts like similar web's David Carr says that X's
*26:09.600- 26:15.300* :  user base is falling. X has put out different numbers saying that things are going great.
*26:16.580- 26:23.000* :  There must be something going on that we're not seeing. But basically everything is down on a
*26:23.000- 26:30.060* :  year-over-year basis. Advertisers have also shunned the platform and the EU has criticized it
*26:30.060- 26:35.920* :  for high levels of disinformation. He hired former advertising exec Linda Jacarino over the summer
*26:36.280- 26:42.000* :  to try to bring them back. Many of you in this room know me and you know I pride myself on my work
*26:42.000- 26:49.260* :  ethic, but buddy, I met my match. But some investors like Ross Gerber say that advertisers won't come
*26:49.300- 26:55.140* :  back until a platform is better moderated. I think that Twitter is dying. I think it's just dying
*26:55.140- 27:01.140* :  right now. And I don't think Twitter users like me want it to die because it's become such a valuable
*27:01.140- 27:06.160* :  resource for me. But it's dying. So I don't care what Elon says. It doesn't matter what he says.
*27:06.400- 27:11.300* :  There's a reality and there's a fantasy. The fantasy that Ross Gerber is referring to is Mr.
*27:11.300- 27:16.740* :  Musk's big dreams for X. This is what he told me he wants X to become. The Twitter is an
*27:16.740- 27:24.140* :  accelerant to X. What does that mean? What does it mean? Well, I guess you'll have to stay tuned
*27:24.140- 27:31.280* :  to find out. Ah, come on. We now know a little bit more. He wants X to do streaming games,
*27:31.280- 27:36.300* :  video call, banking, you name it, the everything app. That was embarrassing almost died.
*27:36.820- 27:42.380* :  But ultimately, X still gets the vast majority of its revenue through advertising. If it's going
*27:42.380- 27:47.880* :  to survive in the short term, it needs to bring them back. James Clayton there.
*27:48.840- 27:54.960* :  The editor-in-chief of British Vogue, Edward Eninful has been named as the UK's most
*27:54.960- 28:00.780* :  influential black person in an annual power list. Others recognised include the dragons,
*28:00.780- 28:07.100* :  Den Star and podcaster Stephen Bartlett. Our community affairs correspondent Adina Campbell reports.
*28:07.920- 28:15.140* :  Edward Eninful started his career at ID Magazine at 18. 951 he's the first black man to hold
*28:15.140- 28:20.600* :  the top job at British Vogue, but earlier this year announced he'd be stepping down to help
*28:20.600- 28:25.840* :  grow the brand globally and focus on other projects. The black power list celebrates people
*28:25.840- 28:31.900* :  of African, African Caribbean and African American heritage. It aims to raise awareness among young
*28:31.900- 28:38.360* :  people of black role models. Other names to make the 2024 list include Lord Willie, who co-founded
*28:38.360- 28:45.120* :  Operation Blackvotes and the comedian Moe Gilligan. Talking of power and success, Taylor Swift
*28:45.120- 28:50.300* :  has become a billionaire according to new analysis from the media group Bloomberg. They say the singer
*28:50.300- 28:55.740* :  is now one of the few artists to reach the milestone based solely on their music and performances.
*28:55.780- 29:00.780* :  Our reporter Adam Childry has more. Taylor Swift is perhaps the biggest name of
*29:00.780- 29:06.120* :  music right now. The US leg of her era's tour is coming to an end and she'll be taking the show
*29:06.120- 29:11.220* :  around the world starting in South America next month. Bloomberg say ticket sales for her
*29:11.220- 29:16.460* :  era's tour shows perform to date have passed 700 million dollars, which have helped Swift's
*29:16.460- 29:23.000* :  network reach 1.1 billion dollars. Only Rihanna, Jay-Z and Beyonce are also reported to have
*29:23.000- 29:29.160* :  passed the billion dollar mark. Since 2019, Swift is estimated to have earned 400 million dollars
*29:29.160- 29:35.060* :  from the music she has released and her total Spotify and YouTube earnings are around 120 million
*29:35.060- 29:40.620* :  dollars. The American pop star is also spreading the cash around, boosting local economies whenever
*29:40.620- 29:47.220* :  she's in town. In Seattle, for instance, downtown hotel revenues reached a record high of 7.4
*29:47.220- 29:52.940* :  million dollars on the first night of her era's tour. Swift has just released a new version of her
*29:52.940- 29:58.900* :  album 1989, which features four new songs. It's her fourth album re-release since 2019,
*29:58.900- 30:03.800* :  and it's part of her campaign to regain control of her own work after an investment company
*30:03.800- 30:09.320* :  bought her master tapes. It will undoubtedly only add to the star's ever-growing fame and fortune.
*30:10.480- 30:12.420* :  That report from Adam Childry.
*30:15.260- 30:19.660* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*30:19.980- 30:25.800* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*30:25.800- 30:34.720* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on ex, formerly known as Twitter
