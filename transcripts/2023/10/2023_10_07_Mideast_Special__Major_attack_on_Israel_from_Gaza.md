*01:18.480- 01:21.920* :  I'm Nick Martin at 13 hours GMT on Saturday the 7th of October.
*01:22.440- 01:25.320* :  We're bringing you the latest on the situation unfolding in Israel,
*01:25.880- 01:30.740* :  offering unprecedented assault by air sea and ground by Palestinian militants in Gaza.
*01:34.540- 01:37.700* :  Dozens of gunmen cross the border infiltrating southern Israel.
*01:37.700- 01:40.800* :  There are reports of civilians and soldiers being taken hostage.
*01:40.820- 01:45.280* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is unequivocal in his response.
*01:45.280- 01:51.780* :  This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the state of Israel and its citizens.
*01:52.900- 01:55.140* :  We are at war and we will win it.
*01:55.580- 02:00.380* :  Meanwhile, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas says his people have the right to defend
*02:00.380- 02:04.780* :  themselves against what he calls the terror of settlers and occupation troops.
*02:05.220- 02:06.460* :  We have a view from the West Bank.
*02:06.780- 02:12.540* :  For months, unprecedented levels of Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians,
*02:13.160- 02:17.760* :  record numbers of settler attacks, of settler raids on Al-Aqsa mosque.
*02:19.780- 02:21.600* :  There's been international condemnation.
*02:21.600- 02:25.020* :  Egypt calls for maximum restraint from both sides.
*02:25.420- 02:29.460* :  And we ask our security correspondent, why was Israel caught off guard?
*02:40.980- 02:45.860* :  In the early hours, the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel,
*02:46.340- 02:49.700* :  beginning with several thousand rockets fired into the south.
*02:50.160- 02:53.820* :  The rocket attacks have struck Tel Aviv and areas around Gaza.
*02:54.420- 02:56.960* :  The town of Ashkelon saw several major explosions.
*02:56.960- 02:59.600* :  Israelis have been warned to stay inside.
*02:59.600- 03:03.280* :  While dozens of militants appear to have entered southern Israel,
*03:03.280- 03:05.820* :  there have been reports of military vehicles being attacked,
*03:05.820- 03:09.880* :  and Israeli soldiers and civilians being kidnapped and taken into Gaza.
*03:10.620- 03:15.040* :  One video obtained by the news agency Reuters shows Palestinians taking out what appears
*03:15.040- 03:20.800* :  to be the dead body of an Israeli soldier from a tank while Palestinians cheer on the border
*03:20.800- 03:22.400* :  between Gaza and Israel.
*03:28.120- 03:32.620* :  The Hamas military commander, Muhammad Dayf, announced the start of the operation in a broadcast
*03:32.620- 03:36.460* :  on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.
*03:36.500- 03:41.580* :  Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Etemniahou, says the country is at war and will win.
*03:41.980- 03:44.760* :  I'm not in Israel, I'm in Hamas.
*03:45.240- 03:52.200* :  Citizens of Israel, we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war.
*03:52.520- 03:58.640* :  This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the state of Israel and its
*03:58.640- 04:04.940* :  citizens. We have been in this since the early morning hours. I convened the heads of the security
*04:04.940- 04:09.420* :  establishment and ordered, first of all, to clear out the communities that have been infiltrated
*04:09.420- 04:15.320* :  by terrorists. This currently is being carried out. At the same time, I have ordered an extensive
*04:15.320- 04:21.560* :  mobilization of reserves, and that we return fire of a magnitude that the enemy has not known.
*04:22.500- 04:28.340* :  The enemy will pay an unprecedented price. In the meantime, I call on the citizens of Israel
*04:28.780- 04:33.340* :  to strictly adhere to the directives of the army and home front command.
*04:34.280- 04:36.460* :  We are at war and we will win it.
*04:37.100- 04:41.740* :  Israel has already launched retaliatory air strikes on Gaza. The Israeli army has said
*04:41.740- 04:46.520* :  it has so far attacked 17 military compounds and four Hamas operational headquarters.
*04:46.740- 04:49.960* :  We'll have more on the response later in the podcast.
*04:50.100- 04:55.000* :  First, though, let's get an update on the latest situation. Julian Marshall spoke to our
*04:55.000- 05:00.760* :  correspondent, Injurusla Yuland now. We're now more than eight hours since this fighting began,
*05:00.760- 05:06.000* :  and what we're hearing, Israeli media reports saying that at least 40 Israelis are dead and
*05:06.000- 05:12.380* :  something like 740 people have been injured. So really, unprecedented numbers, nothing like
*05:12.380- 05:17.700* :  I've seen before covering repeated conflicts between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza,
*05:18.240- 05:24.340* :  since Hamas took over the Gaza Strip back in 2007. And then what's really the nightmare scenario
*05:24.340- 05:29.520* :  for people in southern Israel in particular is to have had what it seems like dozens of Palestinian
*05:29.520- 05:35.660* :  militants infiltrating from the Gaza Strip. 14 locations affected according to Israeli media reports.
*05:36.140- 05:40.460* :  And we've had both Hamas social media channels and Islamic to had channels. Islamic to had,
*05:40.460- 05:44.420* :  of course, is the second biggest militant group in Gaza. They've been putting out videos
*05:44.780- 05:49.220* :  apparently showing Israeli soldiers and civilians captured by their fighters. And
*05:49.220- 05:53.420* :  Islamic to had says some of them have been taken to Gaza that they're being held hostage.
*05:53.420- 05:58.600* :  That would, of course, complicate Israel's military response when it comes to all that happened.
*05:59.140- 06:03.860* :  Has there been any Israeli confirmation, though, of the kidnapping of soldiers and civilians?
*06:04.660- 06:08.840* :  When we've asked the Israeli military about those reports, they have said that they're aware of
*06:08.840- 06:14.320* :  them and they haven't wanted to comment directly at this stage. There are unverified videos that
*06:14.320- 06:19.280* :  we've seen that do appear to show Israeli civilians on the street that look very much like they're
*06:19.280- 06:25.500* :  in the south of the Gaza Strip. There are also videos that appear to be shot inside Israeli military
*06:25.500- 06:30.920* :  bases where we can read signs and things that do locate them as being next to the Gaza Strip.
*06:30.980- 06:36.560* :  The picture is still very unclear at the moment and very fast developing. I mean, you get a sense
*06:36.560- 06:41.820* :  of just how chaotic it is watching Israeli television where you've had people in the past hours
*06:41.820- 06:46.340* :  calling in saying that there are Palestinian militants in the villages where they live close to
*06:46.340- 06:51.600* :  the Gaza Strip. One woman saying that her father had been taken captive. People really frightened
*06:51.600- 06:57.320* :  and calling for the Israeli military or Israeli police to come and rescue them. There are lots of
*06:57.320- 07:02.220* :  party goers at a big overnight party in the Israeli desert close to the Gaza Strip. There are
*07:02.220- 07:08.080* :  pictures of them running away screaming as they hear gunfire early this morning. We've had reports
*07:08.080- 07:12.480* :  somebody that knows one of my colleagues saying that she was with somebody there who was shot
*07:12.480- 07:18.600* :  and killed. It's really very shocking stuff for Israelis and also I have to say for Palestinians too
*07:18.600- 07:23.620* :  because the speed with which this has happened has really taken people by surprise and a lot of
*07:23.620- 07:28.000* :  attention has been focused on the occupied West Bank. In recent weeks and the tensions there,
*07:28.000- 07:33.340* :  we have not been focused so much on what has been happening in Gaza. And what are you hearing from
*07:33.340- 07:38.980* :  Gaza where Israel has already been carrying out retaliatory air strikes? We know that there have
*07:38.980- 07:44.080* :  been large explosions in the Gaza Strip where Israeli warplanes have been in action. There are reports
*07:44.080- 07:50.720* :  there of Palestinian casualties. Very quickly this morning schools businesses in Gaza were closed
*07:50.720- 07:57.200* :  up. People rushed beforehand to try to buy supplies as much as possible knowing from a past
*07:57.200- 08:03.220* :  painful experience that what's now set to happen could be a long and drawn out conflict and it
*08:03.220- 08:07.860* :  would be very difficult for them to provide for their families. Of course, Gaza is such an impoverished
*08:07.860- 08:12.840* :  place already. Living conditions are extremely tough. We know that there are now power
*08:13.300- 08:18.260* :  shortages there are anyway but also internet outages which can make it more difficult to find out
*08:18.260- 08:24.240* :  exactly what's going on. And anybody speculating about the timing of this assault by Hamas because
*08:24.240- 08:30.160* :  this is very close is it not to the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War? Indeed and there's been so
*08:30.160- 08:36.820* :  much written in the Israeli media reports in recent days reflecting on that big 50th anniversary of
*08:36.820- 08:43.920* :  the Yom Kippur War when Israel was called by surprise by Egypt and Syria and reflections on that.
*08:43.920- 08:49.740* :  So I think now that's going to lead to inevitable new reflections about failings of Israeli military
*08:49.740- 08:56.740* :  and Israeli intelligence in this case. Yulam Nell in Jerusalem. The BBC's Rusty Abu Aluf is in
*08:56.740- 09:01.760* :  Gaza City and has been keeping us up to date from there. Tenshin has been always high in this area
*09:01.760- 09:08.440* :  since Hamas captured Gaza about 17 years ago but in especially the last two or three weeks we have
*09:08.440- 09:14.820* :  seen Palestinians protesting along the border and then Israel responded by closing the northern
*09:14.820- 09:21.720* :  border with Gaza preventing about 18,000 workers from going into Israel then suddenly we understand
*09:21.720- 09:28.900* :  from sources that Qatar and Egypt managed to secure some sort of understanding. Hamas stopped the
*09:28.900- 09:35.280* :  protest along the border and Israel reopened the crossing but Tenshin was still remain high but by
*09:35.280- 09:42.080* :  far this is the biggest operation I think since Hamas took over 17 years ago it's been a surprise
*09:42.080- 09:49.120* :  not only for the Israelis but I think also for the people in Gaza they woke up as they were about
*09:49.120- 09:55.720* :  to start their life people were trying to go to school. Saturday is a normal working day in Gaza
*09:55.720- 10:01.540* :  so kids were out in the street going to their school and suddenly we hear thousands of rockets
*10:01.540- 10:09.160* :  being fired from everywhere that caused big panic to people. Next to me is the downtown Gaza I can see
*10:09.160- 10:15.440* :  the most of the shops are closed most of the Gaza are staying indoor because they believe that Israel
*10:15.440- 10:20.220* :  will sooner or later respond harshly to this latest barrage of rockets.
*10:20.620- 10:27.520* :  Rushdie Abu Alouf this violence is the latest upsurge in decades of fraught relations between Israel
*10:27.520- 10:33.020* :  and the Palestinian territories. Mike Thompson is our Arab affairs editor I asked him how different
*10:33.020- 10:40.720* :  this flare-up is from previous events. Well the last big confrontation was in May 2021 where hundreds
*10:40.740- 10:47.280* :  Palestinians were killed around 250 people in Gaza it's thought in 13 in Israel but now the
*10:47.280- 10:52.760* :  big difference there is that there were hundreds of rockets but we're hearing thousands here not only
*10:52.760- 10:59.120* :  that but this has been an invasion by fighters on the ground they've come into Israel on the ground
*10:59.120- 11:06.600* :  unlike simply firing missiles of the country. Yeah and the situation within Gaza has been
*11:06.600- 11:12.140* :  very difficult in terms of humanitarian situation. Do we know why Hamas may have actually launched
*11:12.140- 11:18.220* :  this now? Well it's still guesswork but you could look for instance at the normalization in prospect
*11:18.220- 11:24.880* :  it seems with Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia and Israel and they were watching that with great concern.
*11:25.480- 11:29.340* :  Also of course you've got the holiday period in Israel at the moment you've got a Saturday
*11:29.980- 11:34.460* :  there's an opportunity here I think they might have seen and of course you've got that huge
*11:34.460- 11:39.800* :  increase in violence over the last nine months to a year particularly in the West Bank more than
*11:39.800- 11:45.420* :  200 Palestinians killed and a growing anger amongst the Palestinian community about what's
*11:45.540- 11:49.920* :  happening. A lot of people may be confused because there have been a blockade pretty much fully
*11:49.920- 11:56.160* :  around Gaza from air and land and sea for more than a decade now. How is it possible for Hamas to
*11:56.160- 12:02.060* :  actually get the resources and wherewithal to create such a barrage of rocket fire? Well it's
*12:02.060- 12:07.580* :  thought that a lot of its ingenuity really a lot of homemade weapons there was a big demonstration
*12:07.580- 12:13.220* :  big parade by Islamic Jihad and they were showing off lots of homemade rockets homemade drones and
*12:13.220- 12:17.600* :  that sort of thing which they've managed to put together themselves in what it's thought to be
*12:17.600- 12:23.580* :  sort of underground factories. There's also been quite a lot of funding from Iran and it's thought
*12:23.580- 12:30.400* :  the US believes that there's around a hundred million dollars a year coming in from Iran so that's
*12:30.480- 12:35.320* :  backing it to that's of course in addition to the humanitarian money that comes in from European
*12:35.320- 12:41.560* :  Union, US and also Qatar. And it's hard to see from the outside what Hamas may gain from this
*12:41.560- 12:47.840* :  because the response from Israel will be huge won't it? It's going to be massive yes as we heard
*12:47.840- 12:53.980* :  earlier the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talking about we are at war this is not an operation
*12:53.980- 12:59.800* :  this is a war and there's going to be enormous repercussions but I think there's been a simmering
*12:59.800- 13:05.980* :  frustration amongst the Palestinian community not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank and I think
*13:05.980- 13:11.020* :  now there's been this feeling that they have to do something but they're really going to pay a very
*13:11.020- 13:17.360* :  heavy price for this it seems. Mike Thompson Israeli government officials have told the BBC that a
*13:17.360- 13:22.960* :  major investigation is being launched as to how Israeli intelligence failed to see this massive
*13:23.360- 13:27.620* :  and work-ordinated Hamas attack coming. Frank Gardner is our security correspondent.
*13:28.280- 13:34.620* :  Oh it's huge it's much bigger than anything we've seen in for a very long time. In a way it's
*13:34.620- 13:42.260* :  sort of echoes in a different way what happened in 1973 with the Yon Kippur war where Arab nations
*13:42.260- 13:48.920* :  in that case surprised Israel during a religious holiday and what has happened this morning took
*13:48.920- 13:55.520* :  place right at the end of the Jewish holiday of Sakot and Israeli intelligence which is vast
*13:55.520- 14:00.880* :  and extensive and well-resourced seems to have been caught completely napping they've been caught
*14:00.880- 14:09.380* :  totally off guard this was a well-coordinated well planned operationally secret complex attack by
*14:09.380- 14:16.340* :  Hamas to not any infiltrate but launch all these rockets at the same time and to penetrate Israel
*14:16.340- 14:22.200* :  Israeli border security and I mean Israelis that I expect into it Israeli officials this is
*14:22.700- 14:27.620* :  when I asked him I said how did this happen how could this have happened they say we have no idea
*14:27.620- 14:33.680* :  an investigation has been launched and it'll go on for a long time but they simply Israelis
*14:33.680- 14:38.200* :  are staggered and they're asking their own government how on earth did this happen because
*14:39.160- 14:44.940* :  you know Israeli intelligence is supposed to have informants embedded inside organizations not
*14:44.940- 14:51.160* :  just Hamas but Islamachi had has baller and so on and yet they didn't see this coming or if they
*14:51.160- 14:56.660* :  did they failed to act on it and Frank with regards to the the response we can expect from Israel
*14:56.660- 15:02.340* :  particularly in the past when there have been hostages taken Israeli hostages which it looks
*15:02.420- 15:07.120* :  or so that may well be the case this time the response has been strong and swift doesn't it
*15:08.880- 15:13.460* :  well it's already begun they've they've launched what they call operation swords of iron which
*15:13.460- 15:19.100* :  includes air strikes on Hamas positions in Gaza and undoubtedly civilians will die in that
*15:19.640- 15:27.220* :  but I think when it comes to hostages which the Palestinian Hamas say are not hostages they're
*15:27.220- 15:33.600* :  prisoners of war which I think if they are civilians is not the correct term but that will have to
*15:33.600- 15:40.640* :  be a there's only two ways to resolve that either by a special forces operation so Israel is not
*15:40.640- 15:45.060* :  commenting on it but almost certainly they will be putting together something with their special
*15:45.060- 15:51.300* :  forces kind of elite unit to try and rescue them already to draw up that option for the prime minister
*15:51.300- 15:57.400* :  should he choose to go that way or by negotiation and this is not the time for either side to be in the
*15:57.400- 16:05.340* :  mood to negotiate well you know tensions and conflict are on the rise so I think what's worrying
*16:05.340- 16:11.920* :  Israelis is that if you look at Gilad Sharid I might have mispronounced that but anyhow he was
*16:12.440- 16:18.120* :  an Israeli soldier who was kidnapped and held for five years so this could be a very long drawn
*16:18.120- 16:22.780* :  eye thing which is why they'll want to nip it in the bud and try and rescue them as quickly as
*16:22.780- 16:31.080* :  possible frank garden still to come in this special edition of the global news podcast with today's
*16:31.080- 16:36.040* :  attack coming on the last day of the Jewish holiday so caught we hear forthright reaction from the
*16:45.840- 16:49.640* :  deputy mayor of Jerusalem hey I'm Ryan Reynolds at Mint Mobile we like to do the opposite of what

*17:51.100- 18:02.080* :  podcasts so as that investigation into Israeli intelligence failings gets underway the Israeli
*18:02.080- 18:08.340* :  military has been placed on a war footing Lieutenant Masha Mikkelsen is a spokesperson for the Israeli
*18:08.340- 18:14.260* :  defense forces she spoke to Julian Marshall there's currently as we speak two things going on
*18:14.260- 18:21.900* :  first of all is fighting in these moments in multiple hot points surrounding the Gaza Strip
*18:21.980- 18:30.300* :  Zikim the Reem military camp Sderot Berik Falaza Nakhal Ozz and some more points there has been
*18:30.300- 18:36.120* :  massive deployment approved by the Ministry of Defense and thousands of reservists have been
*18:36.120- 18:43.000* :  called for duty because Israel has declared a state of war and we will make Hamas pay for the mistake
*18:43.000- 18:50.540* :  it made this morning when they chose to attack Israel how many attackers is the Israeli army battling
*18:50.600- 18:56.020* :  is it possible to put a number on the people who came across the border we don't have exact numbers
*18:56.020- 19:02.920* :  yet you've seen videos going around social media them entering both by parachutes from the sea
*19:02.920- 19:11.620* :  on truck on land and right now as we speak IDF air vessels are striking Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip
*19:11.820- 19:19.740* :  so at what point will you be able to say that you have repelled this assaults there are thousands
*19:19.740- 19:25.160* :  if not tens of thousands of reservists that are being deployed right now towards southern Israel
*19:25.560- 19:33.780* :  to attempt getting the situation back to normal to regain stability we are hoping that with correct
*19:33.780- 19:40.740* :  actions by the end of the day we will be closer to clearing Israeli territory of Hamas terrorists
*19:40.740- 19:46.580* :  but right now what's happening is IDF special units is really police special units are going
*19:46.580- 19:52.260* :  almost door to door in places where we know terrorists have infiltrated and they're clearing
*19:52.340- 19:57.820* :  apartments making sure there are no terrorists hiding it's a thing that take time and it may take
*19:57.820- 20:04.040* :  hours. Masha Mikkelson spokesperson for the Israeli defense forces there's been condemnation
*20:04.040- 20:10.220* :  from governments around the world though Iran has expressed support to Tehran hosted leaders of
*20:10.220- 20:16.520* :  Hamas and Islamic jihad back in June and as we've heard the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas says
*20:16.520- 20:21.200* :  the Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves against what he call the terror of
*20:21.200- 20:28.100* :  settlers and occupation troops. Nour order is a Palestinian analyst and writer in the West Bank
*20:28.100- 20:32.820* :  city of Ramallah she spoke to my colleague Julian Marshall about today's conflict. It's important
*20:32.820- 20:40.120* :  for all of us to remember the context here which is that for months UN agencies and special
*20:41.380- 20:48.340* :  organizations have documented unprecedented levels of Israeli violence against Palestinians civilians
*20:48.420- 20:54.600* :  record numbers of settler attacks of settler raids on al-Aqsa mosque which is the holiest
*20:54.600- 21:01.600* :  Muslim site in Palestine and with a right wing government in office a government that is in line
*21:01.600- 21:08.700* :  with these settler groups Palestinians simply had no horizon nothing to look forward to by way
*21:08.700- 21:15.360* :  of ending this miserable and violent reality of occupation and dispossession we know we've heard
*21:15.360- 21:22.340* :  from the UN about more than 1,200 Palestinians that were literally expelled from their homes
*21:22.340- 21:28.500* :  communities that have been wiped out in the past few months and and I think what is happening
*21:28.500- 21:34.080* :  right now comes in that context in Palestinians being fed up having lost all faith,
*21:35.400- 21:39.080* :  feeling that they've been completely abandoned and that they need to take
*21:40.340- 21:46.340* :  matters into their own hands to break this impasse of brutal oppression.
*21:46.700- 21:54.080* :  But so far the Hamas attack in Israel has claimed the lives of a number of civilians.
*21:55.000- 21:57.480* :  Is that really what the Palestinian Authority would wish?
*21:57.640- 22:03.720* :  Well I don't think that the Palestinian Authority was informed of these plans or had any part
*22:03.720- 22:10.840* :  in them and so at this point I think they they find themselves in a very difficult spot if you will
*22:10.840- 22:16.420* :  it's really difficult to imagine what kind of conversations are happening right now in the Palestinian
*22:17.140- 22:24.320* :  leadership they are not part of what is happening but they will have to have a part in its resolution
*22:25.060- 22:32.420* :  the fact that Israeli casualties civilian casualties are involved you know in again in the overall
*22:32.420- 22:37.700* :  picture for Palestinians for ordinary Palestinians who've seen a record number of Palestinian
*22:37.700- 22:45.560* :  children killed over the past two years it's very difficult to ask them whether they feel sympathetic
*22:45.560- 22:51.000* :  I think mostly right now there is shock and and the fact that most of the attacks have been
*22:51.000- 22:57.920* :  directed at Israeli soldiers also makes it very difficult to hear any dissent among Palestinians
*22:57.920- 23:04.120* :  against what's happening. I mean Egypt is already warned of the dangers of escalation I mean
*23:04.120- 23:13.320* :  where is this going? Israel has said it is at war. Yeah Israel has said it is at war we have to
*23:13.320- 23:19.600* :  also remember that Israel under international law is the occupying power it is a military super
*23:19.600- 23:26.360* :  power by international standards it is accused and has been found guilty of prolific human rights
*23:26.360- 23:33.480* :  violations against Palestinian civilians the fact that the occupied is now attacking the occupier
*23:34.000- 23:41.600* :  it is novel it is new but Gaza is not occupied it is it is according to the United Nations it remains
*23:41.600- 23:48.280* :  occupied every aspect of Palestinian life in Gaza remains under the control of the Israeli
*23:48.280- 23:55.920* :  military in the Israeli state. But with this implicit endorsement of the Hamas assault by the
*23:55.920- 24:02.420* :  Palestinian president he's removing himself isn't he from any kind of role as mediator.
*24:02.900- 24:09.000* :  I'm not sure that he has endorsed anything but again I think it's the Palestinian people have the
*24:09.000- 24:14.740* :  right to defend themselves against the terror of settlers and occupation troops. That's a
*24:14.740- 24:20.280* :  fragment of legal fact the Palestinians have the right to defend themselves. I'm not sure that
*24:20.540- 24:25.780* :  that if the Palestinian leadership wanted to endorse the Hamas actions that they wouldn't have
*24:25.780- 24:32.520* :  been more direct. No order who's a Palestinian living in Ramallah. The BBC's Olympic appellum
*24:32.520- 24:38.140* :  lived in Jerusalem for eight years until 2013 I asked her what it was like when Israel comes under
*24:38.140- 24:43.080* :  attack from neighboring territories or countries. The whole time that I live there only once rockets
*24:43.080- 24:49.820* :  fell very close to Jerusalem and that was in 2012 and I remember the first reaction was from all
*24:49.820- 24:55.540* :  the you know I was I had small children and they all went to the bomb shelter so as we as we know
*24:55.540- 25:01.000* :  that if each house in Israel has an integrated bomb shelter and if they don't have it inside the house
*25:01.000- 25:06.520* :  they have it close in a nearby where they can such a run to but in Jerusalem there's the only time
*25:06.520- 25:12.900* :  that we went to the bomb shelter and yeah so it is there is this shock and panic now I have just
*25:12.900- 25:18.780* :  spoken to my neighbors actually just before coming to the studio and they just cannot believe that a
*25:18.780- 25:27.100* :  small group of militants can enter Israel and create you know such a situation of panic and shock.
*25:27.320- 25:32.960* :  And what's the perception amongst them about how Gaza and the militants from Hamas are actually
*25:32.960- 25:38.300* :  funding themselves who do they blame for this? They're blaming Iran and there's an overwhelming
*25:38.300- 25:44.560* :  feeling that Iran is behind it and it's it is much bigger than it looks like and they also feel that
*25:44.560- 25:50.280* :  the similar attack and incursion might happen in the north then of with the help of Hezbollah
*25:50.980- 25:57.400* :  and I lived in a very close East Jerusalem usually they feel that they're safe because militants
*25:57.400- 26:04.120* :  won't attack Jerusalem because it's so close to Al-Aqsa and in top of the rock and that they won't
*26:04.120- 26:08.760* :  do anything on missile attacks or anything like that that might damage the religious places
*26:09.440- 26:13.420* :  but this time they that is this feeling from my neighbors that have just spoken to that
*26:13.420- 26:18.920* :  militants might now come from East Jerusalem from the old city and attack West Jerusalem.
*26:19.200- 26:25.500* :  And all of this of course feeds into suspicion between Arab Israelis Israelis who are citizens there
*26:25.700- 26:29.800* :  and Jewish communities there is an extraordinarily volatile situation.
*26:30.100- 26:35.520* :  It is yeah and they cannot believe there's this real shock and there's this real kind of mistrust
*26:35.520- 26:41.000* :  in the government and what the government is doing and how how how come there wasn't any
*26:41.000- 26:45.180* :  intelligence about this and that's why anything can happen there's there really there's the
*26:45.180- 26:51.680* :  real sense of fear even in Jerusalem among Jerusalemites who didn't usually feel afraid of
*26:51.680- 26:54.900* :  rocket attacks from Gaza or from anywhere really.
*26:57.320- 27:02.300* :  To end this special edition of the Global News Podcast our international editor Jeremy Bowen
*27:02.660- 27:04.440* :  has this assessment of today's events.
*27:04.640- 27:10.680* :  I think we're into unprecedented territory here since Gaza was taken over by Hamas
*27:10.680- 27:17.080* :  well more than 15 years ago now there've been quite a few cross-border wars there've been
*27:17.080- 27:23.920* :  Israeli quite serious big incursions into Gaza but never anything like this with Hamas going
*27:23.920- 27:31.920* :  into Israeli territory in multiple places one of the in Israeli security official has said
*27:31.920- 27:37.840* :  this morning that there were 21 separate incidents going on these Israelis are using language
*27:37.840- 27:43.980* :  like we have been attacked this is a state of war it's also very symbolic because it's just
*27:43.980- 27:51.900* :  been the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 the October
*27:51.900- 27:57.320* :  War the Yom Kippur War which took Israel by surprise and his Israelis are saying Israelis I've
*27:57.320- 28:05.240* :  spoken to this morning are saying it's deliberately similar similar you know this is this is Netanyahu
*28:05.240- 28:11.040* :  Yom Kippur he we have been taken by surprise that's the kind of message I've been hearing from
*28:11.040- 28:17.340* :  Israelis who I've spoken to is is that the answer to the question then why now why has Hamas
*28:17.480- 28:23.100* :  done this now is it the anniversary is is it something else well it's not because of the
*28:23.100- 28:28.400* :  anniversary I think but this has been a great deal of tension and violence has been building up
*28:29.120- 28:34.260* :  between Israelis and Palestinians for months and months and months there has it's been mainly
*28:34.260- 28:41.840* :  though in the West Bank which is the land that goes from Jerusalem through to the Jordan border
*28:42.300- 28:49.100* :  and it's been that has been the focus of this and there've been a lot of killing going on there
*28:49.100- 28:55.780* :  for for months and months now so I think that the culmination of all of that this rising tension
*28:56.500- 29:03.920* :  and during the the current Jewish holiday of Sukkot that's just ending there were quite large
*29:03.920- 29:12.520* :  scale events on the actual compound of the Alaksa mosque in Jerusalem which is the third
*29:12.520- 29:18.400* :  holiest site for Muslims in the world but it's also revered by Jews as the site of the Jewish
*29:18.400- 29:24.340* :  temple the ancient Jewish temple and they were praying then I doesn't sound much but that's
*29:24.340- 29:31.760* :  something which Israelis don't permit and which is considered to be a highly a highly provocative act
*29:31.800- 29:37.360* :  and so Hamas have been saying that they're acting to protect Jerusalem and they've used the word
*29:37.360- 29:43.320* :  Jerusalem in the what they're calling this attack they're calling it Jerusalem flood so they're
*29:43.320- 29:49.000* :  connecting it very much with that because anything that happens that seems to alter any kind of state
*29:49.000- 29:56.940* :  as quote in Jerusalem does almost inevitably lead to violence and I think that I mean I've been
*29:56.940- 30:01.200* :  expecting some kind of serious explosion for months now I didn't think it would happen like this
*30:01.760- 30:07.400* :  I think everybody there has been taken by surprise by what's going on and I think now that the
*30:07.400- 30:14.660* :  Israel will be planning a very fierce response I think it's highly lightly that Israel will
*30:14.660- 30:24.080* :  send troops into Gaza they have called up reservists the anti Netanyahu protesters who include
*30:24.080- 30:30.780* :  reservists who declined their reserved duty in in recent months and have had regular demonstrations
*30:30.780- 30:37.740* :  against the government have canceled their demo for the weekend and they have told their guys
*30:37.740- 30:44.820* :  to report for duty as normal so there's a great sense of emergency going on and I think this
*30:44.820- 30:48.440* :  thing can only escalate Jeremy Bowen there speaking to Michelle Hussein
*30:51.360- 30:55.420* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new regular edition of the global news podcast
