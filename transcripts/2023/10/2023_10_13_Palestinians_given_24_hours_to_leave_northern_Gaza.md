*00:35.100- 00:44.520* :  podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janet Gillil and at
*00:44.520- 00:51.040* :  13 hours GMT on Friday the 13th October these are our main stories. Israel orders more than a
*00:51.040- 00:55.940* :  million people in northern Gaza to move south ahead of an expected ground offensive,
*00:56.600- 01:02.640* :  but the UN warns the evacuation order will have devastating humanitarian consequences in such a
*01:02.640- 01:09.160* :  densely populated and impoverished area. The Republican nominee drops out of the race for US
*01:09.160- 01:18.960* :  House Speaker creating more chaos for Congress. Also in this podcast the biggest takeover in gaming
*01:18.960- 01:26.160* :  history has just been completed and the fact that we can now make some sort of paving slabs,
*01:26.160- 01:30.320* :  paving stones from the lunar regolith is something that's really exciting and it opens up the whole
*01:30.320- 01:36.340* :  world of possibility. Plans to build roads on the moon to help us humans live there.
*01:40.020- 01:45.380* :  Some residents of northern Gaza are fleeing after an Israeli warning that they should move south.
*01:45.960- 01:51.820* :  Hundreds of cars and trucks heavily loaded with possessions even mattresses are heading south
*01:52.280- 01:57.860* :  into what is already one of the most densely populated parts of the world. Many fear they'll be caught
*01:57.860- 02:04.200* :  up in the anticipated Israeli ground offensive which is expected any day now. Many families are
*02:04.200- 02:11.060* :  walking on foot, some are bringing along their cows, camels, sheep and donkeys. Gaza resident
*02:11.060- 02:15.700* :  Suzanne Basak recorded this message as she was packing her bags to leave.
*02:16.340- 02:21.580* :  We were hesitant about what we heard. We were very preplexed and confused whether these
*02:21.580- 02:27.700* :  information are true and what are we going to do because the shelling didn't stop since then.
*02:27.700- 02:34.840* :  There is no safe passage to go but many of my friends have already moved and have
*02:34.880- 02:41.440* :  already reached this out in any areas. We want to make sure first that there is a safe passage
*02:41.440- 02:49.340* :  so we can all move here. We are here like five families of around 30 people. We are packing and
*02:49.340- 02:55.720* :  getting ready to move but many many many people are still hesitant about this. They consider this
*02:55.820- 03:04.800* :  a part of the psychological war on the Gaza civilians and some others are telling like this is
*03:04.800- 03:14.780* :  a part of a bigger plan of immigration towards a Egypt city and they are choosing to stay in their
*03:14.780- 03:21.300* :  houses. Whatever happens. The UN is warning that it will be impossible for the population of
*03:21.300- 03:28.000* :  northern Gaza more than a million people to leave within 24 hours as the Israelis are demanding
*03:28.000- 03:34.160* :  especially when they are under constant bombardment, suffering from food, water and fuel shortages
*03:34.160- 03:40.480* :  and when thousands have been wounded and entire neighborhoods destroyed by Israeli war planes.
*03:40.480- 03:46.300* :  A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lorna defended the announcement.
*03:47.020- 03:52.140* :  People should listen if we are saying that you should evacuate. The first thing that you should do
*03:52.140- 03:57.820* :  when you wake up in the morning is take the necessary belongings and evacuate. That would make
*03:57.820- 04:06.440* :  their situation better. We have the right and we have the obligation to defend the people of Israel.
*04:06.780- 04:12.140* :  You can't expect Israel not to defend its civilians because Hamas is hiding behind his.
*04:13.020- 04:17.600* :  As we just heard, the evacuation order has triggered suspicion among some residents.
*04:17.660- 04:25.200* :  Hamas has called it fake propaganda and urged citizens to ignore it. That's what Amjad Shabbat has
*04:25.200- 04:33.060* :  decided to do. It needs months to approve 1.1 million people to evacuate from the northern of Gaza
*04:33.060- 04:38.920* :  to the southern Gaza and less than 24 hours now are not leaving. It's bitter to die under the
*04:38.920- 04:45.120* :  rubles of our houses than to leave our houses to be bombed. This is hilarious. This is hilarious.
*04:45.120- 04:51.180* :  What are we going to go to Sinai, to Egypt? Where are we going to go? No, we're not leaving. We're
*04:51.180- 04:56.320* :  staying in our houses. Next to what I say, there is a school that became a shirt that of thousands
*04:56.320- 05:04.540* :  of people. More than 50 people pile up in one room that for is by four meters. What will they go?
*05:06.140- 05:11.460* :  We believe that this is part of the psychological war that Israel has been targeting us as civilians.
*05:11.460- 05:17.860* :  If we're not killed by their air strikes, we're killed by the news that they're asking us to
*05:17.920- 05:23.440* :  evacuate or to our houses to be threatened or our relatives to be killed.
*05:24.160- 05:30.260* :  So some guards in sustain put some are fleeing or preparing to flee. But many, like Farah Abu
*05:30.260- 05:35.880* :  said, are stuck in between. I'm sure what to do. I'm seeing the people right now,
*05:36.160- 05:42.340* :  front of me, they hold on their bags and their things and their papers like they want to run away.
*05:43.040- 05:49.760* :  But all of them also shocked like where we should go. That is the question where we should go.
*05:49.760- 05:56.420* :  It's only one city and it's a small city. There's no place. There's no escape. They bomb us
*05:56.580- 06:02.760* :  every single night without any mercy. They wipe it out. A lot of street, a lot of buildings,
*06:02.760- 06:10.260* :  a lot of shops. There's nothing left. And the thing is, no one protects us. There's no
*06:10.260- 06:16.720* :  no one is no safe place here. There's a lot of children out here fight people and bring
*06:16.720- 06:24.880* :  it one month. What are we going to do? I'm just, we've got nothing to do right now. No one
*06:24.880- 06:30.920* :  helps us. We heard there from residents of Gaza as a way up that agonizing decision
*06:30.920- 06:38.580* :  of whether to stay or to flee. So why is Israel ordering people in Gaza to move south? Our chief
*06:38.580- 06:44.880* :  international correspondent, Least You Set, is close to Gaza in southern Israel. Israel's military
*06:44.880- 06:53.180* :  priority now is to intensify its attacks on Hamas's infrastructure. And one of its key targets
*06:53.180- 07:01.680* :  is the underground tunnels that Hamas must use is to keep itself safe, to store, no doubt food
*07:01.680- 07:08.700* :  and fuel. It's military supplies for what it knows will be and even greater is really assault
*07:08.700- 07:15.700* :  on the coastal strip. It could also be where they are holding the hostages. But if Israel
*07:15.700- 07:22.240* :  smashes the tunnels, it will also be destroying the houses, the residential towers, which live above
*07:22.240- 07:28.300* :  the tunnels. So it is asking people to leave as a matter of urgency. It wants to get on with its
*07:28.520- 07:36.820* :  military operations. But even in a country at peace with the greatest of resources moving more
*07:36.820- 07:44.060* :  than a million people is an almost impossible ask. Least You Set in southern Israel,
*07:44.700- 07:49.700* :  but more accounts have emerged of the atrocities committed by Hamas Gumman, who rampaged through
*07:49.700- 07:55.220* :  southern Israel on Saturday. One of the most horrific massacres happened in the caboose of
*07:55.220- 08:01.300* :  Kaffa Azar, one of the last villages to be recaptured by Israeli soldiers. Our correspondent,
*08:01.300- 08:06.460* :  Nick Beak, went to meet one of the survivors who says the crimes she witnessed justify a full
*08:06.460- 08:12.280* :  scale Israeli ground offensive in Tegaza, just to warn you that Nick's report contains details
*08:12.280- 08:21.920* :  you may find distressing. We're here then shooting people, shooting kids and the people that are
*08:22.860- 08:32.540* :  please no, please no. From her hospital bed, 22-year-old Netapotal relives the Hamas massacre
*08:32.540- 08:38.540* :  in her village. Pins hold together her left leg where she was shot five times.
*08:39.560- 08:46.640* :  Sitting next to her, failing to stop his tears, her boyfriend Santiago, he's too upset to speak.
*08:47.100- 08:55.500* :  We start to hear gunshots, they start one apartment, one apartment, one apartment, start to break
*08:55.500- 09:02.640* :  the windows, break the doors and start to shoot. You sound people screaming.
*09:07.660- 09:13.900* :  The killers filmed themselves on the loose, murdering dozens in the Jewish community of Far Azar.
*09:15.380- 09:20.940* :  Trapped in her home with no Israeli soldiers to be seen, Netapotal realized the only person who
*09:20.940- 09:28.140* :  could save her was her dad, who she hadn't spoken to in six years. Hiding, staying silent,
*09:28.140- 09:36.780* :  she managed to message him. They are close, she writes, lock the doors, her dad replies,
*09:37.700- 09:43.640* :  please answer, please. But the gunman soon found Netapotal and Santiago.
*09:44.140- 09:47.500* :  They started to shoot like in one month, like with nothing.
*09:48.180- 09:50.480* :  Netapotal was hit in the hand and both legs.
*09:51.180- 09:57.600* :  In Santiago scream on me, Netapotal stand up, start to run. If you don't stand up, we're going to die,
*09:57.600- 10:02.240* :  we're going to die. Santiago managed to carry her to safety a few streets away,
*10:02.820- 10:07.060* :  where they hid under a big pile of rubbish, trying to stay as quiet as possible.
*10:07.860- 10:09.520* :  Netapotal, netta texted her dad again.
*10:11.420- 10:16.240* :  Dad, they shot me, help. I'm coming, he replies.
*10:17.140- 10:21.460* :  When Shimon Portel, a plain close policeman, arrived at his daughter's village,
*10:21.760- 10:25.040* :  he said gunman shot at children, as well as him.
*10:40.240- 10:45.540* :  Eventually, Shimon found his daughter, near her burnt out home, and drove her in a boyfriend
*10:45.540- 10:53.300* :  to hospital, leaving behind many bodies. Far as a, one of many villages targeted last weekend.
*10:54.280- 10:59.080* :  Netta says Israel must now respond in the strongest possible way.
*10:59.780- 11:06.340* :  They come to kill us. I don't want the Hamas anymore in my life.
*11:07.460- 11:18.000* :  They need to destroy them one by one. I want peace with all my heart, but I think it's not going
*11:18.000- 11:24.520* :  to be peace. Have you been thinking about what may happen to civilians in Gaza if there is a big
*11:24.540- 11:32.120* :  ground operation by the Israeli military? All what I say is for the jihad and the Hamas.
*11:32.800- 11:41.760* :  My country didn't want to hurt the civilians. I don't think they need to die like I don't need to
*11:41.760- 11:50.460* :  die. They like me, but we need to fight. Netta, a survivor of one of the massacres in Israel,
*11:50.460- 11:56.520* :  speaking to Nick Beak. To the U.S. now, where Capitol Hill has seen more chaos.
*11:57.080- 12:01.420* :  Just a day after being chosen as a Republican party's nominee to be speaker of the House of
*12:01.420- 12:06.820* :  Representatives, Steve Skellis has pulled out. If you look at where our conference is,
*12:06.820- 12:10.560* :  there's still work to be done. There are still some people that have their own agendas,
*12:11.300- 12:18.100* :  and I was very clear, we have to have everybody put their agendas on the side and focus on what
*12:18.100- 12:24.840* :  this country needs. Mr Skellis had narrowly beaten the right wing hardliner Jim Jordan in a secret
*12:24.840- 12:31.220* :  ballot, but with Republicans only having a narrow majority in the House, he was unable to win over
*12:31.220- 12:36.800* :  enough of them to replace Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted by Trump supporters earlier this month.
*12:37.580- 12:41.640* :  So what happens now? Our North America correspondent David Willis explains.
*12:42.560- 12:49.980* :  Steve Skellis' decision to withdraw from the race plunges this process in desegonising process
*12:49.980- 12:58.080* :  into further chaos. The House can't act on pressing issues such as aid for Israel, aid for Ukraine,
*12:58.940- 13:04.820* :  or the imminent government funding deadline, which is little less than a little more than a month
*13:04.820- 13:11.200* :  away. At the moment, all the time there is no leader of the lower House. It's possible that
*13:11.800- 13:18.660* :  fellow Conservative, there were Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, whom Steve Skellis defeated in a
*13:18.660- 13:24.960* :  vote on Wednesday, could make another run for the position. Some say it's unlikely, though, that
*13:24.960- 13:31.100* :  even he would be able to secure the votes he needed from this deeply divided House. So possibly
*13:31.100- 13:36.260* :  there could be a third contender, somebody from outside the current leadership ranks perhaps,
*13:37.140- 13:40.300* :  but it's all a bit of a mess and it's all up in the air right now.
*13:41.200- 13:46.820* :  David Willis, it's hoped that one day we humans will return to the moon. The last time anyone
*13:46.820- 13:54.140* :  set foot there was December 1972 on the Apollo 17 mission, and NASA astronauts could be back as
*13:54.140- 14:00.320* :  soon as 2025. But what about staying there long-term, even building on the lunar surface?
*14:01.040- 14:06.840* :  The challenge for future landings is that the surface is almost like a powder. That's
*14:06.840- 14:12.580* :  according to Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon who described what it was like.
*14:24.140- 14:32.240* :  Although the surface appears to be very, very fine-grained as you get close to it, it's all
*14:32.240- 14:38.200* :  those like powder. There might be a solution, though, and it involves lasers. Scientists are developing
*14:38.200- 14:43.840* :  a new technology to melt lunar dust to make it into a strong, glassy material that could help
*14:43.840- 14:49.360* :  visitors get around the moon. Sean Cleaver is the industrial manager of the European project
*14:49.360- 14:53.680* :  that provides power and life support systems for astronauts. She spoke to my colleague,
*14:53.680- 14:59.680* :  Amal Rajan, about this new technology. It's really exciting to hear that something has been done
*14:59.680- 15:03.520* :  towards the infrastructure that we're wanting to build up on the moon. So the whole
*15:03.520- 15:07.620* :  Artemis programme is huge. There are so many elements that need to come together. It's not just
*15:07.620- 15:12.000* :  about the spacecraft, which is the element that I work on, but it's also about thinking about how
*15:12.000- 15:16.380* :  once we get to the moon, how are we going to make the best use of the lunar resources,
*15:16.980- 15:22.780* :  and the fact that we can now make some sort of paving slabs, paving stones from the lunar regolith
*15:22.780- 15:25.840* :  is something that's really exciting, and it opens up a whole world of possibilities.
*15:26.160- 15:30.620* :  Well, if you can do paving slabs, you can do presumably quite complex surfaces that you can
*15:30.620- 15:35.300* :  potentially build launch pads on. Absolutely, and that's one of the key elements that I think we're
*15:35.300- 15:39.720* :  going to start to see in the next decade or so when we return to the moon. Because when we go,
*15:39.720- 15:45.000* :  we're going to need to have habitats, but also maybe launch pads so that we can return our
*15:45.000- 15:50.120* :  astronauts back to the earth, and also other sort of structures that we can use to help us carry out
*15:50.120- 15:53.880* :  the work that we're going to the moon to do. So whether that be scientific or whether that be
*15:53.880- 15:59.940* :  some sort of mining or exploration, having the capability to build is really quite game-changing.
*16:00.220- 16:05.100* :  Where has all that got to? The idea of habitats on the moon seems rather distant to most people
*16:05.100- 16:09.460* :  listening to right now, I suspect Sean, where are the prospects for actually putting
*16:09.460- 16:14.620* :  not whole ecosystems habitats on the moon? How far away is it? Well, it's getting really close now.
*16:14.760- 16:20.340* :  So last year we saw the launch of Artemis 1. That was the test mission to fly the spacecraft
*16:20.340- 16:25.720* :  Orion around the moon and return it to the earth. Now next year we will be doing that again,
*16:25.720- 16:29.880* :  but with a crew of four astronauts. So they won't be landing on the moon next year, but they will
*16:29.880- 16:34.660* :  be orbiting the moon a little bit like they did in Apollo 8 or all those years ago. And then the
*16:34.660- 16:39.540* :  following years with 2025, that's when we're really going to be thinking about, can we land some
*16:39.540- 16:44.560* :  astronauts now on the moon and kick off this whole new chapter of lunar exploration? So really,
*16:44.560- 16:49.680* :  we are really talking in the next five years to get somebody back down on the lunar surface,
*16:49.900- 16:54.580* :  and then of course from there the program will just grow. The plan is to start then building
*16:55.480- 17:00.540* :  infrastructure both on and around the moon and then seeing what we can do with the moon to benefit
*17:00.540- 17:05.340* :  us back here on Earth. Sean Cleaver from the Orion European Service Module Program.
*17:07.920- 17:13.580* :  Still to come on the global news podcast, Olympic organizers look ahead to the 2028 games with
*17:13.580- 17:23.280* :  some possible new sports. Baseball, softball, flag football, lacrosse, sixes, squash, and cricket.
*17:23.800- 17:28.120* :  But before we move on, let's hear about this week's happy pod with Andrew Peach.
*17:28.760- 17:32.260* :  Yes, there are many things in the world it's hard to feel positive about, one of them being
*17:32.260- 17:37.960* :  the climate crisis. But we've been talking to the tech giant Bill Gates and he says there are reasons
*17:37.960- 17:43.600* :  to look on the bright side. Also this week scientists in Spain on a new way of spotting breast cancer,
*17:43.940- 17:49.320* :  the Caribbean island has been turned from a desolate rock to a wildlife haven, and world records
*17:49.320- 17:54.480* :  being smashed all over the place from the fastest marathon in Chicago to the biggest pumpkin in
*17:54.480- 17:59.100* :  Minnesota. Do join me for the happy pod available in this feed or wherever you get your BBC
*17:59.100- 18:09.920* :  podcasts every Saturday. Welcome back to the global news podcast. Hundreds of Afghans who wish
*18:09.920- 18:16.000* :  their lives to work with the UK in Afghanistan have been stuck in Pakistan for months or even longer
*18:16.000- 18:21.380* :  having fled from the Taliban. They're waiting to be relocated to Britain where they're eligible
*18:21.380- 18:28.400* :  for resettlement. But some say they're now living in fear of deportation as Pakistan has started
*18:28.400- 18:34.900* :  taking a tougher approach to migrants without visas. Our Pakistan correspondent, Caroline Davies,
*18:34.900- 18:41.320* :  has this report. Karachi's courts have already seen many Afghans in the last few weeks,
*18:41.320- 18:47.120* :  rounded up in raids, detained, chained, accused of being here illegally.
*18:51.020- 18:55.420* :  Pakistan's government announced that illegal migrants would be deported in November.
*18:55.960- 19:02.680* :  It scared many here particularly the Afghan community. Among the thousands that came to Pakistan
*19:02.680- 19:07.640* :  after the Taliban government took power are hundreds who risked their lives working for the British,
*19:08.260- 19:13.600* :  including translators for the British army, all told by the UK government to come to Pakistan
*19:13.600- 19:21.260* :  so they could be processed for a UK visa. But they're still waiting with their children
*19:21.260- 19:28.100* :  living in hotels in Pakistan with no legal access to school or work. Some have been here for
*19:28.100- 19:33.340* :  over a year. Many were too afraid to speak to us. Others only agreed if we didn't use their
*19:33.340- 19:39.200* :  voices or names, worried if they were identified it could affect their visa case or their families
*19:39.200- 19:44.160* :  still in Afghanistan under the Taliban government despite the Taliban's declared amnesty
*19:44.160- 19:49.100* :  on those who worked with international forces. This man worked with the UK authorities.
*19:49.700- 19:54.960* :  Afghans are all under a lot of stress. Not just my family but everyone.
*19:55.900- 20:01.660* :  It has caused all of us psychological problems. His friend was a translator with the British army.
*20:01.940- 20:07.160* :  We are scared our Pakistani visas have expired. We don't know what's going to happen.
*20:07.980- 20:12.220* :  We don't know if we will be arrested or not. And they fear they cannot go back.
*20:12.220- 20:18.440* :  If we go back we will be at even more risk than before. Before we left Afghanistan,
*20:18.540- 20:23.220* :  if our lives were at 50% danger, now they are in 100% danger.
*20:23.520- 20:27.940* :  They're past what they say are with the UK government. Their Pakistan visas expired.
*20:28.800- 20:33.260* :  Marzia, not her real name, was a teacher with the British Council. She's heavily pregnant,
*20:33.260- 20:37.760* :  but says she was told by her case worker at the international organisation for migration,
*20:38.340- 20:43.160* :  not to leave the hotel, even for doctor's appointments. So we speak on the phone.
*20:43.760- 20:47.640* :  I don't know what to do. It's impossible for me to give birth to my baby
*20:47.640- 20:52.280* :  inside my hotel room. There isn't any facility, there isn't anyone to help me.
*20:53.100- 20:56.840* :  There's a lot of problem and my and my baby's health will be in danger.
*20:57.800- 21:01.240* :  We work for them honestly and it's time for them to help us.
*21:01.340- 21:06.940* :  Five others said they were also told the same by their IOM case workers or the hotel staff on
*21:06.940- 21:12.880* :  their behalf. The IOM said it does not give this advice. Marzia told us she's feeling increasingly
*21:12.880- 21:17.600* :  hopeless. The BBC understands that the UK is in touch with the Pakistan authorities
*21:17.600- 21:22.980* :  to try to make sure people on these schemes aren't affected, but many we spoke to didn't feel
*21:22.980- 21:27.820* :  reassured. The UK government told us it's made an ambitious and generous commitment to help
*21:27.820- 21:32.320* :  at-risk people in Afghanistan and continues to honour its commitments to bring eligible
*21:32.320- 21:37.020* :  Afghans to the UK. But the main answer those we spoke to want is when?
*21:38.020- 21:41.200* :  That report by our Pakistan correspondent Caroline Davies.
*21:42.040- 21:47.620* :  Now to a huge development in the world of gaming. British regulators have approved a 69
*21:47.620- 21:53.440* :  billion dollar deal for Microsoft to buy the maker of the Call of Duty video game franchise
*21:53.440- 21:59.660* :  Act Division Blizzard. The US and EU had already backed the deal, the biggest in gaming history,
*21:59.660- 22:05.540* :  but the UK's competition watchdog originally had concerns. Our business correspondent Mark
*22:05.540- 22:11.560* :  Ashdown reports. After a near two year battle, the biggest takeover in the history of gaming has
*22:11.560- 22:17.460* :  finally got the green light. Activision Blizzard makes hits like Candy Crush World of Warcraft,
*22:17.960- 22:21.820* :  and one of the biggest selling video game series of all time Call of Duty.
*22:22.460- 22:26.900* :  Microsoft's takeover bid was blocked in April by the competition and market authority,
*22:26.900- 22:31.620* :  which oversees mergers and acquisitions in the UK. The regulator feared the deal would
*22:31.620- 22:37.600* :  had Microsoft too much power over the cloud gaming market, where games are bought virtually and
*22:37.600- 22:42.620* :  can be played on a variety of devices and could limit the availability of some of the most popular
*22:42.620- 22:49.100* :  games on rival platforms. A revised deal will now hand the French video game publisher Ubisoft,
*22:49.100- 22:55.180* :  the rights to distribute Act Division's titles on PCs and other consoles. The CMA said that
*22:55.260- 23:02.300* :  will reduce cost for gamers. Mark Ashdown. More than a hundred years after it was last played at
*23:02.300- 23:08.100* :  the Olympics, cricket could be making a return to the games. Back in 1900, cricket was one of only
*23:08.100- 23:14.700* :  19 sports at the Paris Games, but now it's been considered for Los Angeles in 2028 alongside
*23:14.700- 23:19.960* :  several other sports after a meeting of the International Olympic Committee in the Indian City
*23:19.960- 23:28.080* :  of Mumbai. The IOC president is Thomas Beck. These five sports are baseball, softball,
*23:28.300- 23:38.340* :  flag football, lacrosse, sixes, squash and cricket. But it's not a done deal just yet as I heard
*23:38.340- 23:45.000* :  from our sports news correspondent Alex Capstick. It now goes to a vote of the full International
*23:45.000- 23:49.800* :  Olympic Committee membership when they gather here in Mumbai on Monday. But we fully expect
*23:49.800- 23:55.200* :  them to ratify what has already or confirm what has already been told to us by the executive board.
*23:55.200- 24:00.360* :  They want those five sports in the Olympics. It means a great deal for cricket. It means a great
*24:00.360- 24:07.400* :  deal for the IOC Thomas Beck wanted cricket in the Olympics mainly because it would guarantee him
*24:07.400- 24:11.900* :  a huge following or the Olympics are huge following. In this part of the world, in the Indian
*24:11.900- 24:17.700* :  subcontinent where the game is so big and he said that in a press conference afterwards that he
*24:17.700- 24:22.340* :  expects to grow the audience in this part of the world for the Olympics. He'd also get a windfall
*24:22.340- 24:29.360* :  as well because the Indian media broadcasts haven't paid for the rights to broadcast the LA games
*24:29.360- 24:35.900* :  in 2028. The last deal was worth around 20 million dollars. This deal with cricket involved
*24:35.900- 24:41.820* :  as is expected will be worth more than 200 million dollars so experts have predicted.
*24:42.300- 24:45.740* :  Yeah, and you can't really understate how big the audience could be because we're talking about
*24:45.740- 24:52.240* :  the most populous nation in the world, India, where cricket is almost like a religion and it's also
*24:52.240- 24:58.740* :  a country which traditionally has done very poorly at the Olympics. Yeah, you're right. If you
*24:58.740- 25:04.620* :  look at the medal tables over past Olympics, India does not feature high up on the list at all.
*25:04.620- 25:07.700* :  It used to do quite well at hockey. In fact, they've got a bronze medal in hockey at the
*25:07.700- 25:14.300* :  last Olympics, some Olympics in Tokyo. Only two individual gold medals. One is shooting on one
*25:14.300- 25:20.480* :  in Tokyo actually in the javelin and they would have high expectations of doing well at a cricket
*25:21.180- 25:27.700* :  Olympic tournament. It will be a shortened tournament, just 16s involved in the short format
*25:27.700- 25:31.860* :  of the game, the T20 format of the game. But yes, you're right. It's a massive sport here. It's
*25:31.860- 25:36.280* :  the World Cup in India at the moment and everywhere you go in this city of Mumbai,
*25:36.300- 25:41.160* :  indeed, it's probably the same all over the country. There are big screens showing whatever game
*25:41.160- 25:46.920* :  is on at that moment and lots of Indians glued to the television, glued to their radios in the car,
*25:46.920- 25:51.440* :  listening to what's happening. They love this sport and we're talking about, I mean, that's what
*25:51.440- 25:57.440* :  I was speaking to one media expert who felt that this would guarantee Thomas Beck and his Olympic
*25:57.440- 26:04.100* :  movements an increase around six to seven hundred million eyeballs watching the Olympic Games
*26:04.520- 26:11.640* :  in Los Angeles, 2028. So as Thomas Beck explained, it's a win-win situation. Alex Capstick,
*26:12.540- 26:17.960* :  a Japanese man who posted an online video of himself licking a soy sauce bottle at a restaurant
*26:17.960- 26:23.840* :  has been given a suspended three-year prison sentence. As Harry Blire reports, the video was
*26:23.840- 26:32.900* :  just one of several that went viral causing widespread outrage. This video was posted on social media
*26:32.900- 26:39.580* :  in February. It shows a man licking a communal soy sauce bottle at a sushi restaurant. It's happened
*26:39.580- 26:45.840* :  at Kura Sushi, a chain sushi restaurant in the city of Nagoya. But this wasn't a one-off,
*26:46.040- 26:51.980* :  it was part of a dozen copycat videos that emerged around the same time amassing millions of views.
*26:54.040- 26:59.240* :  Others showed a customer licking his fingers and touching dishes passing by on the conveyor belt.
*27:02.380- 27:07.700* :  Another saw a man licking a set of chopsticks on someone else's dish and an unused teacup.
*27:09.280- 27:15.000* :  Immediately restaurants reacted, several sushi chains limited the use of the traditional conveyor belts
*27:15.000- 27:20.660* :  that carry food to diners. Kura Sushi Inc. which has 500 restaurants across Japan
*27:21.360- 27:24.320* :  installed surveillance cameras equipped with artificial intelligence.
*27:25.180- 27:30.560* :  And then the police got involved, arresting three people in March on suspicion of public nuisance.
*27:31.340- 27:38.160* :  On Friday, 21-year-old Ryoga Yoshino appeared at Nagoya District Court where he was given a three-year
*27:38.160- 27:45.780* :  prison sentence suspended for five years. So why did he do it? He wanted online notoriety.
*27:46.380- 27:52.300* :  Yoshino told the judge, I did it to satisfy my desire for recognition and wanted to be popular.
*27:52.840- 27:56.140* :  What I did was very stupid. Harry Bly.
*27:58.700- 28:02.860* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
