*00:55.600- 00:59.320* :  We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 9th of October.
*00:59.320- 01:05.780* :  The Israeli military says it's regained full control of towns and villages overrun by Palestinian militants from Gaza.
*01:06.380- 01:10.300* :  Israel's Defence Minister has ordered a complete siege of the Palestinian territory
*01:10.300- 01:12.600* :  after carrying out hundreds of airstrikes.
*01:13.220- 01:19.320* :  The latest reports say 700 Israelis and 560 Palestinians have been killed will bring you up to date.
*01:21.680- 01:28.000* :  Also in the podcast, food, tents and blankets have started arriving in villages hit by a strong earthquake in Afghanistan.
*01:28.180- 01:32.520* :  How climate change is affecting tourism in popular destinations like Spain.
*01:32.900- 01:37.180* :  The temperature used to go down a little bit and we have a little rest at night.
*01:37.240- 01:41.140* :  But this summer for 20-25 days, that didn't happen.
*01:41.400- 01:46.400* :  So maybe in the future we will have way more people coming to our destination in winter and autumn.
*01:47.020- 01:51.340* :  And the old coins found in Scotland, which may have belonged to a plan chief
*01:51.340- 01:53.940* :  who was murdered more than 300 years ago.
*01:58.080- 02:01.360* :  More than two days after the murderous assault by Palestinian militants,
*02:01.360- 02:06.840* :  the Israeli Defence Forces say they've regained control of the towns and villages that were overrun.
*02:07.560- 02:11.580* :  However, some Hamas gunmen are reported to have entered southern Israel overnight
*02:11.580- 02:14.340* :  through tunnels from Gaza and may still be at large.
*02:14.340- 02:20.000* :  At least 700 people in Israel died in the attacks, including at least nine Americans.
*02:20.000- 02:24.360* :  100 people were taken as hostages across the separation barrier.
*02:24.800- 02:30.540* :  The health ministry in Gaza says 560 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes.
*02:30.540- 02:37.240* :  Israel has called up 300,000 reservists as it gears up for a possible major military operation.
*02:37.240- 02:42.240* :  Israeli Defence Forces spokeswoman Masha Mikkelsen says their immediate focus
*02:42.240- 02:44.800* :  is on rescuing the captives, whatever the cost.
*02:45.400- 02:49.640* :  Israel is a state that holds human life sacred and we will do everything in our power
*02:49.960- 02:53.000* :  to ensure that they're coming back home safe.
*02:53.020- 02:54.500* :  But we're at war.
*02:54.880- 03:01.040* :  What military target was Hamas going for when they murdered over 700 people in the last 48 hours?
*03:01.040- 03:03.980* :  This is the deadliest attack on the state of Israel since its formation.
*03:04.740- 03:10.720* :  74-year-old Ada Saghi is among those believed to have been kidnapped by Hamas near the Gaza border.
*03:11.040- 03:12.960* :  Her son Noam lives in the UK.
*03:13.620- 03:15.860* :  It feels unreal on so many levels.
*03:15.860- 03:18.160* :  It feels inhumane on another level.
*03:18.320- 03:21.840* :  It is very upsetting to think that this is even possible,
*03:21.840- 03:24.320* :  that even in war there are rules.
*03:24.540- 03:28.800* :  And we're talking about men in the 20s and the 30s that come into an old woman house
*03:29.040- 03:30.380* :  and snatch her and her neighbors.
*03:30.380- 03:34.680* :  So I am seeing life a little bit through the keyhole right now.
*03:34.760- 03:37.620* :  And I want to see a man coming back home alive and well.
*03:38.340- 03:42.480* :  Well for the latest on the Israeli military's efforts to restore security in southern Israel,
*03:42.480- 03:44.940* :  I spoke to our correspondent John Donnerson.
*03:45.600- 03:48.980* :  It's a somewhat confused picture in that area around Gaza.
*03:48.980- 03:54.580* :  We've just had a statement from the Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagarri
*03:54.800- 04:01.400* :  and he has said that Israeli forces are now in full control of the communities that were attacked
*04:01.400- 04:02.920* :  by Hamas.
*04:03.200- 04:07.680* :  But there might still be Palestinian militants at large in the area.
*04:07.680- 04:12.820* :  Now earlier the army had said that they remained fighting in seven or eight separate locations.
*04:12.820- 04:18.420* :  The military has also said it believes that Palestinian militants were able to breach the fence
*04:18.420- 04:22.600* :  and pass into Israel overnight with some reports of a tunnel being dug.
*04:22.600- 04:27.760* :  So it does seem that the southern border is not yet completely secure,
*04:27.760- 04:32.600* :  although the military saying that those communities are now under its full control.
*04:33.020- 04:38.700* :  Meanwhile, the defense minister has been making some strong comments about Israel's response to this
*04:38.700- 04:43.840* :  attack. Yes, Israel's defense minister Yohav Galah has said he has ordered a total blockade on
*04:43.840- 04:49.520* :  the Gaza Strip with no electricity, no food and no fuel. Of course,
*04:49.520- 04:57.900* :  Israel has had a blockade on Gaza along with Egypt since Hamas took control back in 2007.
*04:58.740- 05:01.800* :  But it does seem that that is going to be tightened and it's already an incredibly
*05:01.800- 05:08.540* :  difficult situation in Gaza. We've had Israel targeting 500 Hamas targets overnight.
*05:08.540- 05:15.420* :  It says and the UN saying more than 120,000 Palestinians in Gaza have left their homes
*05:15.420- 05:20.060* :  and have been displaced and many of those are sheltering in UN schools.
*05:20.540- 05:25.220* :  And two days on from the start of this assault, how do people in Israel feel?
*05:25.220- 05:28.800* :  We've heard that sirens have been going off in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem where you are.
*05:29.340- 05:33.860* :  Yeah, we just had a siren go off here in Jerusalem a short while ago, apparently because
*05:33.860- 05:40.000* :  some more rockets had been fired out of Gaza. I think, look, Israel is in a state of collective
*05:40.000- 05:46.380* :  trauma. I mean, just to put this into some sort of perspective in previous conflicts back in 2009,
*05:46.380- 05:53.400* :  he had 13 Israelis being killed in 2012. It was six Israelis being killed. Now we're talking
*05:53.400- 06:01.100* :  about more than 700. This is completely unprecedented. It came as a surprise and many Israelis
*06:01.100- 06:06.600* :  are angry at what's happened. But they're also pretty united, I think, in that it needs a strong
*06:06.600- 06:11.700* :  response from the Israeli military and the Israeli government. John Donerson in Jerusalem.
*06:11.800- 06:16.080* :  And as John was saying, the Israeli Defense Minister, you have gallant ordered that the long-term
*06:16.080- 06:21.340* :  blockade of Gaza be tightened into a total siege with even water supplies cut off.
*06:21.340- 06:28.520* :  We are battling beastly people, he said. Manchela Shawa is from the charity Oxfam in Gaza City
*06:28.520- 06:33.920* :  with air strikes continuing. She told us that even before the attacks life for Palestinians in Gaza
*06:33.920- 06:40.160* :  was harsh. Since yesterday morning, we had no electricity whatsoever at our house.
*06:40.840- 06:47.660* :  Now, because it's good to remind people who are listening that before the date of October 7,
*06:48.440- 06:55.120* :  Gaza was suffering. Palestinians have been suffering. So electricity for 15 years has not been
*06:55.900- 07:02.620* :  proper. I mean, it's six to eight hours a day. And this affects also the entire water system
*07:02.960- 07:13.040* :  and access of water to houses. That was an air strike probably in the area. Yeah.
*07:14.300- 07:20.140* :  Well, the situation in Gaza is currently too dangerous to broadcast from, but a few hours before
*07:20.140- 07:26.060* :  we recorded this podcast, I speak to our correspondent in the Palestinian territory, Rishdi Abu Aluf.
*07:26.580- 07:33.760* :  I can see a huge black smoke and dust on the sky covering the entire area. The sound was really
*07:33.760- 07:41.500* :  very loud and very shocking in the area. That was the situation since last night when Israel started
*07:41.500- 07:49.460* :  the second day of revenge into Gaza about 500 air strikes, targeted many places, many locations
*07:49.460- 07:56.780* :  across the Gaza Strait. One of them was admittedly attacked in southern Gaza as the health ministry
*07:56.780- 08:02.920* :  said 19 member of one family. They all killed under the rubble of one house targeted in
*08:02.920- 08:09.520* :  Rafah and South in Gaza where now the funeral for those people are about to take place.
*08:09.520- 08:18.200* :  Hamas official here in Gaza issue warning that keep the border shut will mean that all of the
*08:18.200- 08:24.600* :  essential services cannot be provided for the people within 48 hours. They held like a risk
*08:24.600- 08:29.340* :  conference this morning. They said we are running out of fuel hospitals are running out of
*08:29.640- 08:37.660* :  the essential needs. They said we need the border to be open immediately so we can send those
*08:38.140- 08:42.100* :  who are in critical situation to be treated in bitter hospital maybe in Egypt.
*08:42.860- 08:48.620* :  So the situation is really escalating, mounting the escalation in a very serious way, very dramatic
*08:48.620- 08:53.600* :  way since last night with the sound of exiblusions could be heard everywhere.
*08:53.600- 08:59.280* :  Yeah the UN saying more than 100,000 people have been displaced. Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli
*08:59.280- 09:03.860* :  Prime Minister telling people in Gaza to leave is there anywhere they can go?
*09:05.380- 09:11.440* :  No way I mean the Gaza is 2.3 million people they live in one of the highest densely
*09:11.440- 09:18.340* :  populated places maybe in the entire planet and people have no shelters they have no
*09:18.340- 09:23.060* :  even like you know a certain system that warn them when there is airstrikes.
*09:23.580- 09:30.500* :  Some of the people flee to UN school but the UN schools can't take all of the people.
*09:30.800- 09:37.580* :  Also some of the Israeli IDF spokesman was advising people to go into the city center
*09:37.580- 09:43.400* :  instead of staying next to the border but even in the city center we have seen many buildings
*09:43.400- 09:49.480* :  collapsed and from our bureau in the middle of a Gaza city I'm overlooking the Gaza
*09:49.480- 09:55.500* :  downtown and there is three or four buildings were taken down and they're blocking the main road.
*09:55.500- 10:01.560* :  So many people have been like appealing on local radio station saying where can we go how can
*10:01.560- 10:08.420* :  we hide when there is 500 airstrikes around the around Gaza the presenter was like talking to
*10:08.860- 10:11.800* :  locals who were appealing on the local radio station.
*10:15.440- 10:21.480* :  Hamas spokesman has claimed that Israeli airstrikes overnight and today on Gaza had killed four
*10:21.480- 10:27.160* :  Israeli hostages as well as their Hamas captors. There's been no confirmation of that but the BBC
*10:27.160- 10:33.020* :  has seen video footage that appears to show the dead bodies of at least three hostages on an
*10:33.020- 10:38.540* :  Israeli road near Gaza who were filmed being taken away on Saturday. There are also reports
*10:38.540- 10:43.620* :  that Qatar is trying to broker a deal under which Hamas would free Israeli women and children
*10:43.620- 10:48.460* :  in exchange for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails.
*10:49.040- 10:54.280* :  Our correspondent Anna Foster is in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon just north of Gaza.
*10:54.920- 10:57.720* :  I asked her about the Israeli military build up there.
*10:58.240- 11:05.140* :  What I can see is a large number of Israeli military vehicles that guns are trained towards
*11:05.140- 11:11.180* :  Gaza in some cases they appear to be in a ready to move formation. Now there are a lot of things
*11:11.180- 11:15.380* :  that Israel has to consider right now in terms of a ground offensive and whether it's something
*11:15.380- 11:20.700* :  they want to do. They know that there are hostages, Israeli hostages that are being held inside
*11:20.700- 11:26.040* :  Gaza and that is a consideration because it is so densely packed, densely populated as
*11:26.040- 11:30.960* :  Russia was telling you there to actually go in and carry out a ground operation with minimal
*11:30.960- 11:36.280* :  civilian casualties both on the Palestinian side and to Israeli civilians who are being held
*11:36.280- 11:40.940* :  hostage would be extremely difficult but they do need to try and rescue those hostages.
*11:40.940- 11:46.140* :  Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister has promised a substantial response to those
*11:46.140- 11:51.860* :  attacks in the early hours of Saturday morning. That would look on paper like a ground offensive
*11:52.280- 11:56.880* :  so I think at this stage everybody is watching and waiting to see what will happen here next.
*11:56.880- 12:03.760* :  There are reports of rocket fire coming out of Gaza as well as Israeli air strikes going in.
*12:03.760- 12:09.000* :  How does it feel there? Well it's been happening all morning and in fact we were in the center of
*12:09.000- 12:15.880* :  Ashgalon interviewing somebody just earlier and often on your mobile phone people have apps that will
*12:15.880- 12:21.880* :  actually sort of let you know when there are incoming missiles but in this case the public sirens
*12:21.880- 12:27.980* :  went off and people who live there they know what that means so we along with them we went and took
*12:27.980- 12:34.600* :  cover and literally looked up above and you can hear the loud banging of those missiles from Gaza
*12:34.600- 12:40.680* :  that are being intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome missile defense system it does manage to catch
*12:40.680- 12:45.340* :  most of them they say more than 90 percent but then we saw smoke rising on the horizon so we went
*12:45.340- 12:50.360* :  to an apartment building where a missile had fallen it was right outside actually it was between
*12:50.360- 12:55.620* :  two buildings and you could see the crater in the ground we went to one apartment where the
*12:55.620- 13:00.760* :  shrapnel had sort of blown up and pierced what looked like bullet holes in their windows.
*13:02.140- 13:05.440* :  The family were obviously extremely frightened I talked to parents who were
*13:05.640- 13:10.260* :  were cradling their children next to broken windows to reiterate they are used to this kind of
*13:10.260- 13:15.800* :  thing happening they are used to a certain number of missiles being fired from Gaza but what they
*13:15.800- 13:21.340* :  are seeing at the moment they say feels relentless. Anna Foster in the southern Israeli city of Ashgalon
*13:21.580- 13:26.280* :  in a separate development the Israeli army said it had killed a number of armed suspects
*13:26.280- 13:32.600* :  who had infiltrated into northern Israel from Lebanon a Hezbollah official there said the group
*13:32.600- 13:39.120* :  hadn't mounted any operation into Israel. As we've heard Israel is massing its forces around
*13:39.120- 13:46.180* :  Gaza and many Palestinians abracing themselves for further retaliation. Our analysis editor Rosakins
*13:46.180- 13:51.080* :  has this assessment of the fast moving events of the past few days. Let's start with the
*13:51.080- 13:56.840* :  Islamist militant group that carried out this attack. Who a Hamas? Well its name is an Arabic
*13:56.840- 14:03.800* :  acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement it's sworn to Israel's destruction and its base is Gaza
*14:03.800- 14:09.640* :  it's been in control there since 2007 though as it's not held in an election since it's hard to
*14:09.640- 14:15.360* :  gauge what support it has. This weekend President Biden called Hamas a terrorist organization
*14:15.360- 14:23.620* :  and the EU the UK and the US all categorize it this way. In the region Iran is Hamas's primary
*14:23.620- 14:29.360* :  backer. Hamas also has close relations with the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon which shares a
*14:29.360- 14:35.860* :  border with Israel. Our next question is whether this weekend is different to previous escalations.
*14:36.520- 14:42.360* :  Serious violent escalations between Israel and the Palestinians are not uncommon but the scale of
*14:42.360- 14:48.600* :  this Hamas attack makes it different. Israeli territory was infiltrated over 700 Israelis have
*14:48.600- 14:54.560* :  died as many as a hundred hostages were taken and the UN's Middle East peace envoy says this
*14:54.560- 15:01.280* :  is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink. This is different
*15:01.280- 15:07.780* :  and the scale of the attack leads us to how is Israel responding. Well already Prime Minister Benjamin
*15:07.780- 15:13.860* :  Netanyahu talks of a long and difficult war. There are Israeli airstrikes in Gaza at least
*15:13.860- 15:19.680* :  400 people have been killed. Military vehicles are heading to the Gaza border and tens of thousands
*15:19.680- 15:25.440* :  of Israeli reservists are being called up. As well as that the US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
*15:25.440- 15:31.200* :  has announced that additional equipment and resources including munitions will be sent.
*15:31.220- 15:39.040* :  Israel's allies are offering solidarity and help and while right now the focus is on the immediate
*15:39.040- 15:45.180* :  threat from Hamas, Israel and its allies will also know that in the long term this attack will
*15:45.180- 15:53.680* :  reshape how they seek to maintain Israel's security. Rosakins and still to come on the global
*15:53.680- 16:00.480* :  news podcast. Our 12 year old sister was hoping to become a doctor
*16:00.780- 16:06.320* :  but it's hopeless about her future. I was delighted when I saw the Dars Advert and decided

*17:10.760- 17:15.720* :  In Afghanistan rescue teams have begun to deliver essential aid like food and blankets to
*17:15.720- 17:21.720* :  villages destroyed by a powerful earthquake on Saturday. The 6.3 magnitude tremor flattened
*17:21.720- 17:26.300* :  areas in the western province of Harat. And the death toll continues to rise. I got an update
*17:26.300- 17:32.800* :  from David Azami, head of the BBC Afghan Service. It's a remote area far from the capital Kabul.
*17:33.480- 17:38.820* :  So that's one reason that it's taking a lot of time for aid agencies and the central government
*17:38.820- 17:45.640* :  to carry out rescue operations or deliver aid. But we are getting reports that entire villages
*17:46.180- 17:53.460* :  have been raised because they are mostly made of mud bricks, not very strong buildings.
*17:53.460- 18:01.360* :  And most of the people who died in the earthquake are women and children because they were at home.
*18:01.360- 18:08.640* :  Men are usually our size in the farms or for work. So they were at home. So that's why they are buried
*18:08.640- 18:14.360* :  under the rubble. And many people are still buried under the rubble. And the reports we are getting
*18:14.360- 18:20.820* :  about the death toll is that it is reaching 2500. And it will go up I think because they are
*18:20.820- 18:27.100* :  finding more and more bodies and thousands of people are injured. There are not many hospitals,
*18:27.100- 18:35.000* :  hospitals are overwhelmed. So there is a need for medicines, for shelter, for food, for everything
*18:35.000- 18:44.020* :  you need to survive. Today the deputy prime minister of the Taliban government visited the area
*18:44.020- 18:52.280* :  to assess aid delivery. But the Taliban government has made several appeals from aid agencies and
*18:52.280- 18:57.660* :  international community that we need aid, we need medicine, we need food, we need everything.
*18:57.920- 19:02.160* :  Yeah, because even before this the Taliban government was struggling with the economy,
*19:02.160- 19:07.840* :  it's a very poor country. It is one of the poorest countries in the world. There are UN
*19:07.840- 19:15.280* :  agencies which are main involved in humanitarian work. But the UN itself was asking the international
*19:15.280- 19:21.960* :  community even before this earthquake that we need aid desperately because the winter is coming,
*19:21.960- 19:29.280* :  a lot of people need food to survive. But this is an additional challenge that they are facing.
*19:30.060- 19:34.300* :  So it will be a big challenge for the Taliban government especially because they are now in charge
*19:34.300- 19:40.300* :  and they are expected to deliver. But also for aid agencies as well, there are some Afghan
*19:40.300- 19:46.420* :  businessmen inside the country and outside of Afghanistan who have pledged aid. But it will take
*19:47.420- 19:56.140* :  many days and weeks to arrive. And if you look at the comments made by Afghans speaking to the BBC
*19:57.560- 20:05.900* :  on social media, they are criticizing international response or indifference because they say that
*20:05.900- 20:12.060* :  it is saddening and people of the international community is not responding quick enough.
*20:12.520- 20:17.620* :  And the news of that was obviously overshadowed by what is happening in Israel and Gaza.
*20:18.140- 20:24.080* :  David Azami of the BBC Afghan Service. Well, staying in Afghanistan, a BBC educational program
*20:24.080- 20:27.680* :  aimed at children who are barred from school has launched its second series.
*20:28.240- 20:34.020* :  Dars, which means lesson, will run on radio, TV and online until the end of the Afghan school year
*20:34.020- 20:37.060* :  in December. Helena Wilkinson has been looking at its impact.
*20:40.960- 20:45.840* :  A lesson in mass delivered in Pashti, one of the languages of Afghanistan.
*20:48.520- 20:53.120* :  Since the program launched six months ago, the team has been tracking its impact.
*20:53.140- 20:57.840* :  Here are some of the messages from the audience, read by a BBC journalist.
*21:00.940- 21:05.700* :  Our 12-year-old sister was hoping to become a doctor, but it's hopeless about her future.
*21:06.260- 21:11.860* :  I was delighted when I saw the Dars advert and decided to make sure my sisters watched the program.
*21:12.080- 21:18.060* :  Dars Baman omid me the head. Dars gives me hope. I was wondering if there are people out there
*21:18.060- 21:25.900* :  that care about me. Now I know. The program is broadcast in both Dari and Pashtu,
*21:25.900- 21:31.620* :  Afghanistan's two national languages, and includes stories from around the world and lessons
*21:31.620- 21:39.960* :  in science and English. School. I go to school. It's presented by BBC journalist who work
*21:39.960- 21:45.860* :  themselves evacuated from the country. Hi, my name is Alia Farsan and I'm presenting Dars.
*21:46.160- 21:51.800* :  As I was in the country a few weeks ago and I witnessed that people were very happy about this,
*21:51.800- 21:57.020* :  especially those girls in the parents that the girls couldn't go to school and they didn't
*21:57.020- 22:02.440* :  have any other help during this period. Tell her that I've removed it. I've come to the gallery
*22:02.440- 22:08.940* :  where the team is in the middle of recording the program. The presenter is Shazia Haya and
*22:08.940- 22:15.360* :  she's in the studio next door to us. Salamunah. It's vital for us. My cousins are in Afghanistan.
*22:15.360- 22:20.880* :  They are not able to go to schools and they have grown up and seeing me as a lady who had
*22:20.880- 22:25.800* :  opportunity to go to school, who had opportunity to go to university and now who has the opportunity
*22:25.800- 22:33.520* :  of working. Fiona Crack is head of world service languages. She says it's particularly difficult to
*22:33.520- 22:39.320* :  get any accurate measure of the program's impact. What we do see is the response from the girls,
*22:39.320- 22:43.900* :  from the children, through our social channels telling us it's making a difference to their life.
*22:44.340- 22:50.600* :  Pashtana Durani campaigns to improve the lives of women and girls through her educational charity
*22:51.220- 22:55.980* :  learn Afghanistan. That sits in a brilliant and brief thing to do, especially when you don't have
*22:55.980- 23:01.720* :  a political position to do it and you just do it. Not wait for somebody or your country or the
*23:01.720- 23:06.460* :  political system to change. That's the biggest allyship that anyone could do with Afghanistan right now.
*23:06.680- 23:13.040* :  Huge numbers of children in Afghanistan can't go to school. The DARS program may be one of their
*23:13.040- 23:22.900* :  only avenues to education. That report by Helena Wilkinson. This year many parts of the world
*23:22.900- 23:27.620* :  suffered unbearably hot temperatures with southern Europe particularly badly affected.
*23:28.220- 23:32.460* :  There are concerns that as the impact of climate change becomes increasingly obvious,
*23:32.460- 23:36.920* :  it will affect the EU's $600 billion dollars a year tourism industry.
*23:37.340- 23:39.720* :  Guy Hedgeko reports from Benadorm in Spain.
*23:42.460- 23:48.020* :  Europe's hottest ever summer may be coming to an end, but in the beach result of Benadorm,
*23:48.020- 23:55.820* :  the sun is still shining. Hey, yeah, it's 27. It is absolutely fine. I mean, I burned from
*23:55.820- 24:00.420* :  head to toe, but that's just by the bay, isn't it? Too hot during the day, yeah, unless you're
*24:00.420- 24:06.660* :  actually in the pool, you know, obviously the only respite you get is in the hotel room where you
*24:06.660- 24:10.740* :  got the aircon. You just need to be able to feel a bit of the heat into your bones,
*24:11.200- 24:13.720* :  other than that, and if it gets too hot, you can't go out there.
*24:15.500- 24:20.680* :  In Mediterranean countries, climate change is starting to be felt in the tourism industry.
*24:21.740- 24:27.780* :  We used to have a way smoother nights. The temperature used to go down a little bit and we
*24:27.780- 24:34.080* :  have a little rest at night, right? But this summer for 20-25 days, that didn't happen.
*24:34.320- 24:39.640* :  So maybe in the future we will have way more people coming to our destination in winter and autumn,
*24:39.640- 24:46.900* :  and not that much in summer. Temperatures are increasing in the Mediterranean region, 20 percent
*24:46.900- 24:52.420* :  faster than the global average. Here in Spain, there were four heat waves last summer,
*24:52.840- 24:56.920* :  during which temperatures exceeded 40 Celsius in many areas of the country,
*24:57.460- 25:01.880* :  as the authorities recommended that people remained indoors during the hottest time of day.
*25:01.880- 25:09.360* :  Italy saw record temperatures over the summer, and wildfires caused thousands of people to be
*25:09.360- 25:19.940* :  evacuated from islands in Greece. The science suggests these are not freak weather events.
*25:22.820- 25:27.720* :  The tendency over the coming years will be longer summers, starting earlier and finishing
*25:28.120- 25:31.200* :  later, and we will have longer more intense heat waves.
*25:34.140- 25:39.880* :  The possibility of extreme heat seems to be influencing where many holiday makers go.
*25:40.760- 25:47.160* :  Since the pandemic, cooler destinations like Denmark and Iceland have been particularly popular.
*25:49.520- 25:54.920* :  We are seeing a gradual but sustained trend that people are traveling more to the north of Spain
*25:54.920- 26:04.660* :  and to northern Europe, and this will continue. It's still too soon to know the full impact of climate
*26:04.660- 26:10.000* :  change on tourism, but it could be that southern European resorts like Benadome
*26:10.900- 26:16.360* :  will soon face stiff competition from places where the sun doesn't always shine.
*26:18.440- 26:25.060* :  Guy Hegeco in Spain. A horde of coins hidden under a stone fireplace in Scotland has been found
*26:25.060- 26:31.440* :  after 330 years. They believed who belonged to a highland clan chief murdered in the massacre
*26:31.440- 26:37.740* :  of Glencoe in 1692. The coins were discovered by an archaeology student on her first ever dig.
*26:37.740- 26:40.820* :  Our Scotland Correspondent Alexandra Mackenzie reports.
*26:41.660- 26:47.820* :  The archaeology team from Glasgow University said this was the first major excavation in Glencoe.
*26:48.080- 26:53.260* :  The dig focused on scattered rocks believed to have been the Mcdonald clan chief summer house.
*26:53.300- 27:00.140* :  More than 300 years after he died in the Glencoe massacre, an archaeology student taking part in
*27:00.140- 27:07.320* :  her first ever dig found the horde. The University of Glasgow said that discovery contained 36 silver
*27:07.320- 27:14.740* :  and bronze coins dating from the late 1500s to the 1680s, including pieces from the time of
*27:14.740- 27:21.500* :  Queen Elizabeth I and King Charles I. It's thought the horde was hidden just before or during the
*27:21.500- 27:27.300* :  Glencoe massacre for safekeeping. A number of other artefacts were also discovered at the site,
*27:27.300- 27:33.020* :  including a musket and filing short potterie from across Europe and a powder major.
*27:33.700- 27:39.140* :  Alexandra Mackenzie. We're returning now to our top story, the escalating conflict in the
*27:39.140- 27:44.480* :  Middle East. The attack by Hamas militants is a huge challenge for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
*27:44.480- 27:50.540* :  Netanyahu. His right-wing government has deeply divided the nation over its sweeping legal reforms,
*27:50.540- 27:56.380* :  and his political opponents are blaming him for failing to keep Israeli safe. Our international
*27:56.380- 28:02.060* :  editor Jeremy Bowen spoke to Martha Carney. The recriminations have already started. In the
*28:02.600- 28:09.180* :  anti-government newspaper Aharetz, there's a coruscating editorial. Of course, condemning what's
*28:09.180- 28:15.040* :  happened, the attacks, but also saying that the person that's faulted is Netanyahu, the Prime
*28:15.040- 28:19.700* :  Minister, because he's been so concerned with his own legal problems. He's on trial for corruption.
*28:20.480- 28:25.580* :  He's been concerned as well with the very ideological nature of his current government in trying
*28:25.580- 28:33.100* :  to take over areas of the West Bank. So, on that side, there are already arguments about who
*28:33.100- 28:37.700* :  is responsible. Now, I don't think there are any arguments among Israelis about what they should
*28:37.700- 28:42.780* :  do next in terms of taking military action. And the military action could include a ground operation
*28:42.880- 28:48.700* :  which would be very significant given the ground forces were withdrawn one day in 2005.
*28:49.960- 28:56.260* :  Yeah, Israel occupied Gaza fully, the whole of it, until the early 90s when the peace process
*28:56.260- 29:01.840* :  started. But they still retained a large area of Jewish settlements where there were soldiers.
*29:02.440- 29:07.760* :  They were pulled out in a unilateral action in 2005, not part of a peace agreement. And what
*29:07.760- 29:13.860* :  are the reasons why up to now, the Israelis have tried to contain Hamas in Gaza rather than
*29:13.860- 29:19.000* :  grow in as many people have called for on the Israeli side to settle the matter as they put it once
*29:19.000- 29:24.060* :  and for all. One of the reasons is that they don't want to get into an occupation again.
*29:24.560- 29:30.720* :  The occupation was very difficult for them. Gaza is a strip of land along the Mediterranean coast,
*29:31.400- 29:38.920* :  but it has a population of around 2.4 million people. So, fighting in that area will guarantee
*29:38.980- 29:44.320* :  large numbers of civilian casualties. And if they try to put troops on the ground in a long,
*29:44.320- 29:47.180* :  long operation, they're putting a lot of his raided casualties too.
*29:47.660- 29:49.620* :  All right, international editor Jeremy Bowen.
*29:52.380- 29:56.200* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
