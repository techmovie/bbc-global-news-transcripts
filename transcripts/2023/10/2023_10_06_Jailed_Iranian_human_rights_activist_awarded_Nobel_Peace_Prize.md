*01:23.140- 01:27.600* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 Hours GMT on Friday the 6th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:28.100- 01:33.680* :  The Iranian Human Rights Activist Nard Gez Mohamedi has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
*01:33.680- 01:36.080* :  We look at the message that sends Tehran.
*01:36.520- 01:40.980* :  The UN says Thursday's attack on a Ukrainian cafe, which killed more than 50 people,
*01:41.320- 01:43.320* :  appeared to be caused by a Russian missile.
*01:46.360- 01:49.640* :  Also in this podcast, we've heard about the impact of long COVID.
*01:49.640- 01:55.040* :  What about the misery of the long colds and new evidence that shows we arrived in the
*01:55.040- 01:57.460* :  Americas far sooner than previously thought?
*02:12.000- 02:17.080* :  We start with the words of the jailed Iranian human rights activist Nard Gez Mohamedi.
*02:17.460- 02:21.900* :  The more they punish me, the more determined I become to fight until we achieve freedom.
*02:22.600- 02:25.180* :  And she has just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
*02:25.680- 02:28.800* :  The head of the Norwegian Committee in Oslo, Beret Freyze Anderson,
*02:29.660- 02:32.520* :  explained why Nard Gez Mohamedi deserved the accolade.
*02:33.320- 02:38.800* :  Her brave struggle has come with tremendous personal cost.
*02:40.140- 02:48.700* :  Altogether, the regime has arrested her 13 times, convicted her five times,
*02:49.460- 02:58.840* :  and sentenced her to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes.
*03:00.520- 03:05.740* :  Meez Mohamedi is still in prison as I speak.
*03:13.800- 03:16.300* :  She has been a fierce advocate of non-violence.
*03:16.300- 03:20.760* :  She was the first in Iran to begin an organized campaign against the death penalty.
*03:20.760- 03:24.920* :  She formed this group called the gradual abolition of death penalty.
*03:24.920- 03:27.840* :  Not only did death penalty not get abolished in Iran,
*03:27.840- 03:31.900* :  but they threw her in jail because of leading that crusade.
*03:31.900- 03:36.000* :  As you know, death penalty is one of the sacred pillars of Sharia law.
*03:36.000- 03:39.660* :  That's why the clerical regime did not accept that.
*03:40.360- 03:47.020* :  In addition to that, she, while being a complete, full-fledged civil rights activist,
*03:47.400- 03:50.040* :  she held out a lot of hope for the reform movement as well.
*03:50.040- 03:54.720* :  She took part in the elections where the candidates were moderates or reformists
*03:54.780- 03:56.100* :  until a few years ago.
*03:56.500- 04:00.420* :  But then when the reform movement began to falter and people turned their backs
*04:01.000- 04:07.700* :  on the reformist faction, she as well became a proponent of changing the political system
*04:07.700- 04:10.500* :  and its entirety, which is her stance today.
*04:10.940- 04:17.480* :  And to what extent has she been an inspirational figure for the more recent wave of protests
*04:18.200- 04:20.020* :  against human rights abuses in Iran?
*04:21.160- 04:25.380* :  Well, she was an advocate for also the abolition of mandatory hijab,
*04:25.380- 04:29.920* :  which is the reason why those protests began last year after Mahsa Amini
*04:29.920- 04:32.400* :  died at the hands of the morality police.
*04:32.400- 04:38.380* :  So while she was in prison, she kept on sending out these statements and communicate
*04:38.380- 04:40.280* :  in support of the protesters.
*04:40.960- 04:48.440* :  Of course, Iran has a very factual opposition movement, both diaspora and the opposition movement
*04:48.440- 04:50.380* :  inside Iran. They're very polarized.
*04:50.380- 04:54.860* :  So some of the more radical elements of the opposition don't like her because they think
*04:54.860- 04:56.340* :  she's too easy on the government.
*04:57.500- 05:01.580* :  The government doesn't like her, but she has been an inspiration from the mainstream
*05:01.580- 05:04.020* :  opposition movements in Iran.
*05:04.620- 05:10.780* :  And Sivash, we heard the Iranian semi-official news agency fast, condemning this prize,
*05:11.460- 05:15.180* :  saying the West has awarded her against Iran's national security.
*05:16.040- 05:20.580* :  What could happen to her now? Do you think this could perhaps make her position even harder?
*05:21.800- 05:25.400* :  Well, I mean, they couldn't do nothing that they haven't done to her already.
*05:25.400- 05:28.920* :  She's been deprived of seeing her kids grow up.
*05:28.960- 05:35.520* :  She has two teenage children now, one daughter and a son, both 16.
*05:35.520- 05:37.600* :  They live with their father in Paris now.
*05:37.600- 05:39.600* :  She's never seen her kids grow up.
*05:40.060- 05:44.880* :  She's been in prison almost all her political, during her political career in the past
*05:44.880- 05:50.040* :  decades. As soon as she would come out and would join the protesters or would issue a statement
*05:50.040- 05:55.020* :  that would put her back in prison, just recently they extended her prison term for another 12 years.
*05:55.020- 06:02.860* :  So she's languishing in jail, but even while being in jail, she is still remaining steadfast
*06:02.860- 06:07.360* :  and issuing statements supporting protesters and the protest movement.
*06:07.360- 06:13.400* :  So she's remained very much in the headline and continues to be a figure in her own right.
*06:13.960- 06:16.540* :  That was Sivush Arland from the BBC's Persian Service.
*06:18.000- 06:21.600* :  It was the deadliest missile strike to hit Ukraine in more than a year.
*06:21.860- 06:24.000* :  And according to the country's interior ministry,
*06:24.000- 06:29.680* :  every family in the north-eastern village of Kroza has been affected by Thursday's attack.
*06:30.140- 06:34.540* :  52 people are now known to have been killed, including an eight-year-old boy.
*06:35.160- 06:38.920* :  Liz Throssel, the spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
*06:39.420- 06:43.340* :  labelled the air strike deplorable and a horrible loss of human life.
*06:43.760- 06:46.800* :  She said that the UN had assigned a field team to investigate.
*06:47.640- 06:52.100* :  UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Falkertuk, who saw for himself the horrific
*06:52.100- 06:57.120* :  impact of such strikes, is profoundly shocked and condemns these killings.
*06:57.120- 07:02.620* :  He's deployed a field team to the site to speak to survivors and gather more information.
*07:02.900- 07:06.820* :  Before the Russian invasion, the village's population was about 300.
*07:07.580- 07:10.280* :  It's not clear how many residents were still living there,
*07:10.720- 07:13.020* :  but it's clear that with the high number of people killed,
*07:13.020- 07:15.960* :  everybody in this small community has been affected.
*07:16.680- 07:21.540* :  Ukraine has blamed Russia for the attack and said that there were no military targets in the area.
*07:22.220- 07:24.840* :  But in a phone call with reporters, the Kremlin's spokesman,
*07:24.840- 07:27.180* :  the Midpoly Peskov, had this defiant response.
*07:29.820- 07:33.380* :  The Russian military does not attack civilian targets.
*07:34.100- 07:37.340* :  Strikes are carried out against military infrastructure facilities,
*07:37.360- 07:43.360* :  places of concentration of military personnel and representatives of the military leadership.
*07:44.600- 07:49.340* :  So where does this attack leave both Ukraine and Russia in the wider context of the war?
*07:49.900- 07:53.080* :  A question for our international editor, Jeremy Bowen, who's in Kiev.
*07:53.980- 07:59.060* :  There's been a massive amount of condemnation among Ukraine's allies about
*07:59.860- 08:03.340* :  what happened in that village, the number of people who were killed,
*08:03.340- 08:11.300* :  the way that it looks as if a wake following a funeral seems to have been targeted
*08:12.020- 08:15.220* :  with those absolutely appalling consequences.
*08:15.300- 08:21.720* :  Now, this comes at a difficult time for the Ukrainians because they're
*08:21.720- 08:28.060* :  summer offensive, which they hoped would bring strategic breakthroughs that would change the war.
*08:29.120- 08:31.080* :  That hasn't succeeded in doing that.
*08:31.080- 08:33.440* :  It continues, but those breakthroughs haven't come.
*08:33.980- 08:40.880* :  And longer term worrying for the Ukrainians is the fact that cracks have appeared in Western
*08:40.880- 08:46.580* :  support. They follow very closely what happens abroad. People in the government,
*08:46.580- 08:53.080* :  President Zelensky of Ukraine has been meeting European leaders in Spain and he is constantly
*08:53.920- 08:58.500* :  trying to shore up support for his country and its war effort.
*08:58.500- 09:04.340* :  Now, there is no prospect of the tap being turned off immediately, nothing like that.
*09:05.100- 09:08.580* :  But Zelensky said at the beginning of the year, this is going to be the year of victory,
*09:08.580- 09:09.980* :  now it's clear that that's not going to happen.
*09:10.360- 09:14.960* :  And there is a growing realization on all sides that this is going to be a long war.
*09:15.720- 09:21.520* :  Zelensky and the Ukrainian leadership is very conscious that the cracks in support that have
*09:21.520- 09:27.680* :  been seen in Poland, in Slovakia and in the United States, that all of those things could widen.
*09:28.500- 09:32.060* :  So I think that this is a time of decision.
*09:32.120- 09:36.220* :  The next couple of months, Ukrainians, of course, say they don't have a choice in this.
*09:36.220- 09:37.240* :  They have to keep on fighting.
*09:37.240- 09:42.840* :  But for their allies, there are decisions to be taken about how they gear up
*09:43.180- 09:47.100* :  to help support Ukraine in the next phases of this war.
*09:47.800- 09:48.480* :  Jeremy Bowen.
*09:49.700- 09:55.620* :  Now to Uganda, where earlier this year, so-called courtship rape was made unconstitutional.
*09:56.220- 10:00.960* :  For generations in the Caramagia area, in the north of the country, many young men had been
*10:00.960- 10:06.440* :  abducting and reaping girls as young as 13 and keeping them until they consented to marriage.
*10:07.180- 10:09.000* :  It's a crime that went unpunished.
*10:09.280- 10:12.980* :  And now, despite a recent ban, there are reports it's still widespread.
*10:13.500- 10:17.600* :  James Coppnell has been hearing more about this from a lawyer in the region, Christine Akelo.
*10:18.440- 10:28.100* :  The meaning of courtship rape in the Caramagia context is the act of a boy in company of his
*10:28.120- 10:35.220* :  peers, grabbing a girl, whom he may be in a relationship with or not,
*10:36.080- 10:40.960* :  with intention of having a sexual relationship with her.
*10:41.580- 10:46.520* :  A boy comes with his peers, a group, and they look up the girl.
*10:46.520- 10:51.800* :  The boy's teammates may help him to access the girl by holding her down.
*10:52.360- 10:54.700* :  And the boy who has interest in the girl,
*10:55.440- 10:58.860* :  accesses her and has a sexual intercourse with her.
*10:59.100- 11:04.980* :  This happens even by elderly men, but the victims often are young girls.
*11:05.520- 11:09.500* :  Young girls of maybe 13, 14, at least below 18 years.
*11:09.940- 11:13.080* :  And what happens to these girls and women afterwards?
*11:13.800- 11:16.460* :  You may be forced to stay with the perpetrator.
*11:16.460- 11:22.640* :  The person will rape you because of the shame that someone has had sexual intercourse with you.
*11:23.220- 11:27.400* :  And now this person, if it goes ahead and pays the dowry for you,
*11:27.900- 11:30.640* :  the relationship is converted into a marriage.
*11:31.120- 11:36.500* :  In the other alternative, you can actually run away from the district.
*11:37.020- 11:42.020* :  It is practiced in all the nine districts which constitute the Caramagia region,
*11:42.800- 11:43.780* :  so it is that wide.
*11:44.260- 11:46.720* :  What does Ugandan law have to say about this?
*11:47.280- 11:50.620* :  No, they've got the law condemns the act.
*11:51.280- 11:54.500* :  We have other laws, for example, we have the Pinocond act,
*11:55.200- 11:59.700* :  which is used to criminalize the acts of courtship rape.
*12:00.140- 12:02.760* :  However, despite the presence of those laws,
*12:02.760- 12:06.620* :  it is still going on in some areas actually unabated.
*12:07.640- 12:13.480* :  So this must be something that is terrifying for parents, for young women?
*12:13.920- 12:17.880* :  Actually, growing up of a young girl in the Caramagia context,
*12:18.280- 12:24.120* :  deep in the rural setting, is terrifying because it is very obvious
*12:24.620- 12:26.540* :  you are likely to be a victim of this.
*12:27.060- 12:33.080* :  By the time you reach 1314, it is very likely that your parents are looking at you as a,
*12:33.380- 12:38.580* :  you know, a potential for a relationship and how that relationship ends,
*12:38.580- 12:40.900* :  most often it's recorded ship rape.
*12:41.420- 12:44.220* :  The girls almost have no choice but to go through it.
*12:44.700- 12:49.180* :  That was the lawyer Christine Akello who is in the Caramagia region of Uganda.
*12:51.140- 12:55.700* :  Now, feeling down about having a virus is not just in your imagination
*12:55.800- 12:57.440* :  and is a recognized thing.
*12:57.620- 13:03.360* :  That is the advice today for a scientist in the UK who have been researching long colds.
*13:03.880- 13:09.160* :  Just as with long COVID, people who have had a cold are experiencing prolonged symptoms often.
*13:09.820- 13:13.920* :  A study of more than 10,000 adults showed that some of these can include symptoms
*13:13.920- 13:16.700* :  like a cough, stomach pain and diarrhea.
*13:17.560- 13:19.580* :  Our health correspondent, Michelle Roberts told me more.
*13:20.600- 13:25.900* :  The idea is not brand new, experts have known for a while that after a viral infection,
*13:26.040- 13:32.100* :  although most people recover, some people say that they still experience some symptoms after,
*13:32.100- 13:37.320* :  even if their initial illness wasn't that bad, sometimes they can have these enduring symptoms.
*13:37.900- 13:41.620* :  And we've heard more about it obviously with COVID recently because in the pandemic,
*13:41.620- 13:46.540* :  so many of us have caught COVID and then we've had this thing that's now been called
*13:46.540- 13:50.200* :  long COVID, which is enduring symptoms afterwards.
*13:51.780- 13:56.240* :  So this study was actually looking at adults doing a survey
*13:56.840- 14:00.700* :  during early on in the pandemic before the jabs had been rolled out.
*14:00.700- 14:06.300* :  So nobody had been vaccinated in this group of people they were looking at the 10,000.
*14:06.940- 14:10.420* :  And they were asking them about any symptoms that they had over a couple of months.
*14:11.260- 14:18.580* :  And within that group, there were just over 1,000 of them said that they'd had COVID recently.
*14:19.300- 14:25.220* :  And then some others, about 500, said they'd had some sort of respiratory illness,
*14:25.600- 14:26.480* :  but it wasn't COVID.
*14:26.980- 14:30.580* :  And then when they started asking, well, have you had any persistent symptoms,
*14:30.580- 14:36.240* :  they did find that in both of those respiratory virus groups, they did have some of them.
*14:36.700- 14:40.340* :  So they're saying it's important to recognise that you can get something
*14:40.340- 14:41.660* :  a bit like long COVID.
*14:41.660- 14:44.460* :  You can get a long cold is what they're calling it.
*14:44.580- 14:47.940* :  And what are the symptoms of it? Are they similar to the symptoms of long COVID?
*14:47.940- 14:48.660* :  And what are they?
*14:48.920- 14:51.840* :  So there were similarities and some differences too.
*14:52.020- 14:54.820* :  So with the long cold, it was things like a cough,
*14:55.240- 14:57.160* :  upset stomach or a bit of diarrhea.
*14:57.700- 15:01.160* :  Whereas with the long COVID, the thing that seemed to be a bit different with that
*15:01.160- 15:05.400* :  was sometimes there was the kind of brain fog that we've heard about before.
*15:05.900- 15:09.920* :  And also some loss of smell and taste, some of the more classic COVID symptoms.
*15:10.040- 15:12.100* :  But there was some overlap between the two.
*15:12.780- 15:13.680* :  That was Michelle Roberts.
*15:14.740- 15:20.060* :  A set of footprints have unlocked the secrets of when early humans reached North America.
*15:20.540- 15:25.100* :  The prints were found in New Mexico and scientists say they're 23,000 years old.
*15:25.220- 15:29.740* :  And that means our distant ancestors were happily coexisting with the wildlife there
*15:29.900- 15:31.620* :  for far longer than we used to think.
*15:32.080- 15:33.120* :  Claudia Cockrell reports.
*15:34.240- 15:37.180* :  The last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago,
*15:37.600- 15:42.060* :  and with it went animals like the woolly mammoth, the ground sloth, and the saber-tooth tiger.
*15:42.620- 15:46.200* :  It's long been thought that humans had arrived in North America around this time
*15:46.200- 15:48.660* :  and may have hunted the animals to extinction.
*15:49.440- 15:52.920* :  But in 2021, scientists discovered fossilized footprints
*15:52.960- 15:55.640* :  at the White Sands National Park in New Mexico.
*15:56.260- 16:00.760* :  They worked out how old the footprints were by dating some seeds which were embedded in the same
*16:00.760- 16:01.680* :  layer of earth.
*16:02.020- 16:07.500* :  And their age suggested that humans could have reached North America up to 10,000 years earlier
*16:07.840- 16:08.360* :  than we thought.
*16:09.000- 16:12.420* :  Now, new research has been published in the academic journal Science,
*16:12.460- 16:14.660* :  which backs up the original findings.
*16:15.360- 16:19.660* :  Sally Reynolds is a professor of paleoacology who was part of the research team.
*16:19.860- 16:23.600* :  We did think that humans couldn't possibly have made it into North America
*16:24.200- 16:28.680* :  prior to about 16,000 years because there were these massive ice sheets in the way.
*16:29.360- 16:34.480* :  Either we migrated earlier, perhaps the ice sheets weren't to the great barrier,
*16:34.480- 16:37.600* :  that we have been thinking that they were, or, excitedly,
*16:37.600- 16:43.180* :  that they were probably multiple routes that were used by early humans to make it into the region,
*16:43.180- 16:44.120* :  and that's exciting.
*16:44.700- 16:48.480* :  If the findings are correct, then it means that humans and ice age animals
*16:48.480- 16:52.040* :  lived on the same land for many thousands of years longer.
*16:52.220- 16:57.800* :  We thought humans must have made a devastating initial impact in the ecosystems into which
*16:58.400- 17:01.320* :  they merged, they moved, because as soon as the humans appeared,
*17:01.720- 17:04.020* :  large animals start dying left right in center.
*17:04.560- 17:09.760* :  The work at White Sands extends the period that we were living with the megafauna,
*17:09.760- 17:15.180* :  and it's clear they were not as initially devastating as we had first supposed.
*17:15.780- 17:16.980* :  That was Claudia Cockrell.
*17:19.980- 17:20.980* :  Coming up in this podcast,
*17:28.180- 17:31.820* :  but also to have all the information that today we don't have.
*17:32.560- 17:36.280* :  We take you inside the first virtual museum of stolen objects.
*17:42.920- 17:48.340* :  Live's less ordinary is the podcast with astonishing personal stories from across the globe.
*17:48.340- 17:49.340* :  You are the only survivor.
*17:49.940- 17:52.460* :  I say, how could a pod odyssey they all die?
*17:53.060- 17:54.440* :  Expect the unexpected.
*17:55.100- 17:56.720* :  We were having a big, terrible discussion.
*17:57.200- 17:58.140* :  How could someone ever do this?
*17:58.440- 17:59.220* :  How could that ever happen?
*17:59.220- 18:04.120* :  And that's the first time I ever came out with my story about how I was almost a school shooter.
*18:04.600- 18:07.600* :  Live's less ordinary from the BBC World Service.
*18:08.140- 18:10.540* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:15.800- 18:18.180* :  Most weight loss programs are short term fixes,
*18:18.780- 18:21.380* :  but managing your weight needs a long term solution.
*18:21.900- 18:23.360* :  And that's what makes Noom different.
*18:23.960- 18:28.740* :  Noom uses science and personalization to help you manage your weight for the long term.
*18:29.220- 18:34.280* :  Their psychology-based approach helps you build better habits and behaviors that are easier to maintain.
*18:34.980- 18:35.640* :  The best part?
*18:36.180- 18:39.540* :  You decide how Noom fits into your life, not the other way around.

*18:53.960- 18:57.420* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets.
*18:57.820- 18:58.540* :  I was overwhelmed.
*18:58.540- 19:00.840* :  Like I had never seen anything like this.
*19:01.020- 19:03.740* :  At the height of Abercrombian fits to success.
*19:03.940- 19:06.420* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.
*19:06.700- 19:09.600* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity.
*19:09.940- 19:15.620* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money, sex and power.
*19:16.640- 19:18.520* :  This is world of secrets.
*19:19.140- 19:21.320* :  Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
*19:21.600- 19:23.700* :  Listen wherever you get your podcasts.
*19:30.520- 19:36.140* :  20,000 children displaced every day over a six-year period because of extreme weather events.
*19:36.660- 19:38.780* :  That is the shocking headline of a new report
*19:38.780- 19:41.940* :  by the United Nations Children's Agency, UNICEF.
*19:42.460- 19:44.400* :  Forena Canouse is from UNICEF.
*19:44.820- 19:47.720* :  And she's been telling my colleague, Davina Gupta, more about the findings.
*19:48.740- 19:53.900* :  I think it's important that we don't forget that this is still a very conservative estimate.
*19:54.480- 19:59.780* :  The real numbers may actually be a lot higher because the data that exists is incomplete.
*20:00.500- 20:05.000* :  In particular, children that are forced from their homes in a situation of drought
*20:05.560- 20:06.640* :  are often not captured.
*20:06.640- 20:12.420* :  And in many countries, the systems in place to record children displaced are not very strong.
*20:12.940- 20:14.820* :  But what does it look like being displaced?
*20:14.820- 20:18.100* :  I think it's important to see that they're very different situations.
*20:18.240- 20:22.800* :  So children get displaced and forced from their homes in the face of an immediate disaster.
*20:22.800- 20:26.000* :  Imagine and think of a storm, a cyclone, a typhoon.
*20:26.600- 20:31.800* :  And in many countries like the Philippines or India that have invested in early warning systems
*20:31.800- 20:36.100* :  and in strong disaster risk reduction management capacities,
*20:36.740- 20:38.840* :  many of these children are being evacuated.
*20:38.840- 20:45.460* :  So, lives are saved, but still sometimes and too often communities still get racked
*20:45.460- 20:50.000* :  by these storms and returned to their home or their community is often taking months
*20:50.000- 20:51.420* :  or sometimes not possible.
*20:51.980- 20:54.740* :  But then there are other countries like South Sudan, for example,
*20:54.760- 21:01.000* :  where floods have been displacing around 12% of the child population over the last six years.
*21:01.680- 21:05.980* :  And where early warning, evacuations, disaster risk management,
*21:06.500- 21:12.200* :  or return to a life back in their community is simply often just out of reach and impossible.
*21:12.820- 21:15.920* :  So it's important to remember that these realities are very different
*21:15.920- 21:21.800* :  being displaced in the face of a disaster depends on where you are and how vulnerable you are.
*21:22.180- 21:27.700* :  And we're talking about the next generation, the future of the human race in these countries as well.
*21:27.700- 21:31.760* :  And we're talking about the large chunk of children being displaced from these countries
*21:31.760- 21:35.380* :  that you've mentioned. Do you think the world is doing enough and listening?
*21:36.420- 21:41.300* :  I don't think the world is doing enough because if we're leaving countries like South Sudan
*21:41.300- 21:48.660* :  and children and communities in Somalia to face these extreme weather events without support,
*21:49.320- 21:50.860* :  we are clearly not doing enough.
*21:51.380- 21:55.000* :  So the question is, what is it that we can and must do urgently?
*21:55.020- 22:00.420* :  It is really important and that is why UNICEF wanted to shine a light on these children,
*22:00.940- 22:06.760* :  on this growing number of children that are being displaced in a context of a fast-changing climate.
*22:07.320- 22:13.140* :  We need to direct our efforts and attention to invest in early warning systems in the most
*22:13.140- 22:18.540* :  at risk communities, in capacities of countries and communities to recover and rebuild.
*22:19.140- 22:25.400* :  We need to in design and invest in schools and health facilities that can withstand
*22:25.400- 22:31.860* :  these kinds of shocks, typhoons, cyclones, floods, they are accelerating, they are becoming more
*22:31.860- 22:37.160* :  intense, they're becoming more frequent and they will be affecting a growing number of children.
*22:37.160- 22:43.060* :  So the investments are really critical if you want to save lives and you want to protect the
*22:43.060- 22:48.380* :  future children that are yet to be driven from the homes by these extreme weather events
*22:48.580- 22:49.160* :  in the future.
*22:49.940- 22:51.980* :  Farona Canal from UNICEF.
*22:53.340- 22:58.620* :  A long extinct supervolcano in the western scrublands of the United States is at the heart of an
*22:58.620- 23:03.720* :  increasingly contentious debate about the benefits and costs of switching to electric vehicles.
*23:03.820- 23:09.340* :  Forty kilometers from the Nevada Oregon border, geologists found one of the world's largest
*23:09.340- 23:15.280* :  deposits of lithium, a key element in electric battery production. In the push towards a greener
*23:15.280- 23:19.560* :  cleaner economy, many countries have committed to moving from petrol to electric cars,
*23:20.060- 23:24.660* :  but that depends on a big increase in mining for the metal which causes local environmental
*23:24.660- 23:31.040* :  damage often in contested lands. Our technology reporter James Clayton went to visit the mine and
*23:31.040- 23:33.420* :  speak to tribe members who've long opposed it.
*23:37.700- 23:44.280* :  The Pistachone, Paiju, Bannock people were escaping the U.S. cavalry attacks from this area
*23:44.280- 23:50.040* :  kind of past Sentinel rock here and the U.S. cavalry chased the people into this area right here
*23:50.040- 23:56.700* :  where the mine is being dug up at the moment and they were massacred. It's a tragedy. It should
*23:56.700- 24:02.940* :  be deemed a historical site. That should stop the mining altogether. Unfortunately, the corporations
*24:04.220- 24:10.640* :  didn't hear that. Nevada has only been a state for 160 years. It's been inhabited by the
*24:10.640- 24:16.540* :  relatives of these people long before. They travel here every year to remember their ancestors
*24:16.540- 24:22.460* :  that they say were murdered at this spot. This year though, the tone is even more somber.
*24:22.800- 24:30.240* :  In the distance, the rumble of heavy machinery. Beneath the sagebrush here could be one of the
*24:30.240- 24:36.460* :  biggest lithium deposits in the world. This is Thacker Pass and in March, work began on getting
*24:36.460- 24:41.680* :  it out of the ground. But this mine is different mainly because many of its supporters
*24:41.680- 24:47.540* :  claim to be environmentalists and say that the mine could play at least some role in tackling
*24:47.540- 24:52.860* :  climate change. Global leaders across the world have committed to electric vehicles which lithium
*24:52.860- 24:59.100* :  is essential for. This is Tim Crowley, representative of lithium-americas who owns this mine.
*24:59.560- 25:06.300* :  Lithium is essential. It's the it is the key component to getting high energy storage batteries
*25:06.300- 25:12.720* :  into our market. Right now, we're completely dependent on fossil fuels for the energy we utilize
*25:12.720- 25:18.000* :  every day. But there are environmentalists who believe the answer to tackling climate change
*25:18.380- 25:24.900* :  isn't yet more mines. John Hadter heads up a local environmental charity. A mining operation is in
*25:24.900- 25:31.060* :  fact very damaging to the environment and we've got to be very careful how we permit these things
*25:31.500- 25:34.780* :  because this is their ancestral land. It's being taken from them yet again.
*25:35.460- 25:40.360* :  Opponents to this mine think that this is just the beginning, that this whole area will become
*25:40.360- 25:46.240* :  one massive mining district. And when you ask lithium-americas, it's pretty clear that that's
*25:46.240- 25:51.140* :  exactly what they want. I know that there are concerns that this whole area which is stunningly
*25:51.140- 25:56.800* :  beautiful might end up becoming a mining district. If the United States is going to be self-sufficient,
*25:56.800- 26:02.400* :  there has to be more, there has to be more developments. The people at this protest are already
*26:02.400- 26:07.560* :  looking at how they can strategize to protest against other mines planned in the area.
*26:08.080- 26:12.620* :  Basically this one patch in the middle, that's the only place not claimed right now and that's
*26:12.620- 26:19.620* :  really scary. But it looks like mining in the name of saving the planet may only be just beginning.
*26:19.660- 26:25.540* :  James Clayton, our technology reporter. A group of politicians and privacy
*26:25.540- 26:30.480* :  campaigners in Britain have caught on an immediate end to the use of live facial recognition
*26:30.480- 26:35.760* :  for public surveillance. They've signed a statement with tech experts and campaign groups
*26:36.200- 26:40.700* :  to raise concerns about the police and private companies deploying the cameras which have now
*26:40.700- 26:44.980* :  been outlawed in the European Union. Here's our technology editor Zoe Climent.
*26:45.720- 26:49.880* :  The Home Office has stated that it wants to explore the further use of live facial
*26:49.880- 26:55.640* :  recognition technology in the UK to help fight crime. It involves scanning the public
*26:55.640- 27:00.820* :  with cameras and using artificial intelligence to compare the images of the faces captured
*27:00.820- 27:06.000* :  with those on a watch list. The Metropolitan Police says it's deployed the tech six times
*27:06.000- 27:11.480* :  this year, including at the King's Coronation. And private companies such as FaceWatch offer
*27:11.480- 27:16.620* :  a scheme for shops, alerting them to the presence of potential shoplifters identified by other
*27:16.620- 27:22.400* :  local stores. But today's statement by the MPs and campaigners warns there's little evidence
*27:22.400- 27:27.280* :  that the tech is effective and argues there's no sufficient legal basis for its use.
*27:27.280- 27:34.600* :  They also highlight human rights concerns. Zoe Climent. Now, how do you make a museum of stolen
*27:34.600- 27:40.140* :  cultural artifacts? Well, the United Nations cultural body UNESCO says it's come up with an
*27:40.140- 27:45.860* :  answer. It is planning to make the world's first virtual museum of stolen objects which it's
*27:45.860- 27:51.400* :  developed with the International Police Organization in support. I heard more from Ernesto Otone,
*27:51.400- 27:57.260* :  Assistant Director General at UNESCO. We are not building a museum, a traditional museum
*27:57.260- 28:03.980* :  that you can see in every city around the world. What we are doing is a virtual conception
*28:03.980- 28:12.180* :  of a museum. And that's why the form is a tree with branches with roots and the world that is
*28:12.480- 28:20.640* :  somehow the continent that contain all these elements is to work through these ramps all around
*28:20.640- 28:29.080* :  by region entering to countries where they will see this object in three dimension or in virtual
*28:29.080- 28:36.220* :  dimension with all the story that is behind not only where it was stolen from, what museum,
*28:36.220- 28:43.500* :  what archaeological site, but also from which community, what it means, what is the history beyond
*28:43.500- 28:48.840* :  the construction of this object artifact? So, Ernesto, people are going to be able to see these
*28:48.840- 28:55.760* :  objects in three dimensions on their screens. Yes, the idea is that they smell, they feel, they touch
*28:55.760- 29:02.560* :  in the virtual world, those objects, but also to have all the information that today we don't have.
*29:02.560- 29:08.300* :  So, we have to work a lot with our member states to recreate the history where they come from.
*29:08.840- 29:14.600* :  It will be a museum and that's important to understand that goes in the contrary line of what a
*29:14.600- 29:21.760* :  museum is. So, it will not be to expand its collection, but at the end what we want is to gradually
*29:21.760- 29:27.740* :  empty the museum. And it will mean that all objects that have been stolen have been recovered.
*29:28.520- 29:31.940* :  That was Ernesto Otone, assistant director general at UNESCO.
*29:32.940- 29:38.540* :  Finally, two singers, the Icelandic star Björk and Spain's Rosalía, have joined forces with a
*29:38.540- 29:43.640* :  new song that highlights what they believe are the dangers of industrial fish farming. This report
*29:43.640- 29:44.640* :  from Wendy Erkert.
*29:51.980- 29:57.840* :  The York has campaigned on many environmental issues before. She's a long time supporter of
*29:57.840- 30:05.540* :  the Activist Greta Timberg and she set up a foundation in 2008 to protect the natural environment of
*30:05.540- 30:12.880* :  Iceland. Now she's focusing on industrial fish farming and that's because last year the
*30:12.880- 30:19.420* :  country's two biggest fisheries merged. As a result of that ice fish farm now controls four
*30:19.420- 30:26.160* :  fjords in the country and aims to process 10 million salmon each year. Björk has publicly
*30:26.160- 30:31.600* :  questioned the conditions that the salmon are being kept in and she's called for much tighter
*30:31.600- 30:37.820* :  regulations on fish farming. The singer also claims that salmon are escaping from the fish farms,
*30:37.820- 30:44.400* :  breeding with the wild salmon and changing the DNA which she says could eventually wipe out
*30:44.400- 30:51.780* :  the wild salmon that Iceland is famous for. Ice fish farm insists its only goal is to deliver
*30:51.780- 30:54.660* :  high quality salmon while respecting nature.
*31:10.600- 31:16.360* :  That's a preview of the new song is the first time Björk and Rosalia have collaborated and it's
*31:16.360- 31:22.800* :  the Icelandic singer's first release since her 2022 album which heralded the beauty, traditions
*31:22.800- 31:29.520* :  and nature of Iceland. The song has yet to be named but it will be released sometime this month
*31:29.920- 31:35.520* :  and both singers have vowed to use the profits to bolster the fight against industrial fish farming
*31:35.520- 31:47.920* :  in Iceland. And that's all from us for now but before we go here's Jackie with news of the next
*31:47.920- 31:54.080* :  happy pod. Yes, in the next edition we will be celebrating the extraordinary comeback of US
*31:54.080- 31:59.880* :  gymnastics rock star. Yes, I said rock star Simone Biles. After two years out of the sport,
*31:59.880- 32:04.140* :  she is back and she is doing astonishing things. We'll be hearing about how.
*32:04.560- 32:08.920* :  The New Zealand man who learnt to read in his 50s so he could tell his grandkids stories
*32:09.400- 32:13.820* :  and who has now written his own book. We'll hear from the winners of this year's Nobel prize
