*00:41.120- 00:46.740* :  I'm Robyn Brandt and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 23rd of October, these are our main stories.
*00:46.740- 00:51.640* :  Israel's military has maintained its intensified bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
*00:52.100- 00:55.680* :  More aid is getting into Gaza but the UN says it's nowhere near enough.
*00:58.140- 01:03.980* :  Also in this podcast, Argentina's voters prove the opinion polls wrong and back a surprise candidate
*01:03.980- 01:09.160* :  for the presidential election runoff next month and researchers here in the UK say they've made
*01:09.160- 01:14.260* :  a major breakthrough treating cervical cancer. This is the biggest improvement that we've seen in
*01:14.260- 01:21.060* :  this cancer in almost 25 years, making those changes has really been what's made the difference.
*01:25.820- 01:31.260* :  After another night of Israeli aerial bombardment in Gaza, Hamas says the total number of people
*01:31.260- 01:37.660* :  killed there has now passed 5,000. The group carried out the initial massacre of civilians in Israel
*01:37.660- 01:44.000* :  two weeks ago which killed more than 1,400 Israelis. Hamas, remember, is regarded as a terrorist
*01:44.800- 01:49.960* :  organisation by the US, the UK and some other governments. In addition to those airstrikes
*01:49.960- 01:56.180* :  overnight, Israel's military said today it had also conducted limited raids into Gaza to target
*01:56.180- 02:01.580* :  gunmen and search for hostages. Daniel Hagarri is a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces.
*02:09.380- 02:13.660* :  These raids are raids that kill squads of terrorists who are preparing for the next stage
*02:13.660- 02:19.240* :  in the war. These are raids that go deep to the contact line. These raids also locate and
*02:19.240- 02:24.120* :  search for anything we can get in terms of intelligence on the missing and the hostages.
*02:25.460- 02:30.740* :  Well, late last night, staff and patients at a hospital in the south-west of Gaza were told to
*02:30.740- 02:36.600* :  evacuate. Explosions were heard nearby shortly afterwards. Our correspondent Rosti Abu al-Aluf
*02:36.600- 02:42.180* :  is in Khan Yunis in the south of Gaza. Another night of heavy bombardment in different areas,
*02:42.180- 02:46.760* :  especially around the Al-Quds hospital in a neighborhood called Talil-Hawar,
*02:46.840- 02:52.640* :  south-west of Gaza, where Israel for a couple of times called the director of the hospital
*02:53.100- 02:58.420* :  asked him to evacuate. The director told me this morning that we have about 500 patients
*02:58.420- 03:04.320* :  in the hospital and about 1500 people who are taking the hospital as refuge. And he said,
*03:04.320- 03:09.840* :  we decided not to leave the hospital. Last night about 10 air strikes within few meters of the
*03:09.840- 03:16.120* :  hospital, maintaining more pressure when the people there to leave. Most of the building around
*03:16.120- 03:21.620* :  daily, we either destroyed or damaged. And also there was air strikes overnight in
*03:21.620- 03:26.660* :  Khan Yunis, where I am staying, about four people were killed in the overnight bombing.
*03:26.660- 03:32.300* :  So non-stop shielding, non-stop air strikes, they are bombing everywhere. In Rafaq south,
*03:32.300- 03:38.340* :  in the middle, in Nusairat, we have seen air strikes. So there is no safe place. Most Palestinians
*03:38.340- 03:43.240* :  they are saying there is no safe place. So some of the people who left their homes, they're
*03:43.240- 03:43.860* :  going to get it to end back.
*04:12.960- 04:17.120* :  We don't know how effective they have been. There was at least one that we know of that was
*04:17.120- 04:22.340* :  carried out in the early days of these hostilities. So they're not new. I think the assumption
*04:22.340- 04:27.060* :  might be this kind of thing has probably been happening a fair amount, but we don't hear about
*04:27.060- 04:32.100* :  most of it. But what we know today is that the Israeli military says that yesterday forces
*04:32.100- 04:37.340* :  went in onto the other side of the fence so they weren't west from the Israeli side into the
*04:37.340- 04:44.000* :  Gaza Strip and they said to clear an area of government and weapons and to try to find information
*04:44.000- 04:50.140* :  about hostages. Now they say that missiles were then fired at their forces by Hamas that one
*04:50.140- 04:56.660* :  IDF soldier was killed and three others injured. Now Hamas has also spoken about this saying it
*04:56.660- 05:02.740* :  happened east of Khan Yunis, the city in southern Gaza and the Israeli soldiers crossed the fence,
*05:02.740- 05:09.100* :  getting several meters in. They said they engaged with the Israelis and they claim they destroyed
*05:09.100- 05:15.600* :  two bulldozers and a tank before the Israeli soldiers fled. So clearly activity on the ground,
*05:15.640- 05:20.540* :  but as I say I don't think this is new and these are very sort of limited incursions it seems
*05:20.540- 05:25.540* :  like with a very sort of specific goal. Can I ask you a little bit about the aid that is crossing
*05:25.540- 05:31.060* :  again for the third day rapper from Egypt into Israel. I think a dozen or so trucks today,
*05:31.060- 05:35.260* :  but the UN making it very clear that it doesn't think this is anywhere near enough.
*05:36.320- 05:40.740* :  It's making that extremely clear because you know we had around 20 on the first day around 14
*05:40.740- 05:45.500* :  or 15 yesterday and then a very limited number again today, carrying food, water,
*05:45.500- 05:52.500* :  crucially and medicines. But what we've heard from the UN is that on a normal day before the hostilities
*05:52.500- 05:57.240* :  there will be hundreds of trucks of commodities entering Gaza. You know now they're getting
*05:57.240- 06:04.100* :  just a dozen maybe maximum 20 per day in this incredibly challenging situation. Just to give you
*06:04.100- 06:09.660* :  a sense of the crisis, the humanitarian crisis that is now gripping Gaza. I mean people are being
*06:09.660- 06:16.360* :  reduced in some cases to drinking saline or seawater. Some people drinking dirty agricultural water
*06:16.760- 06:21.880* :  from wells which may contain pesticides at the same time that the hospitals are on their knees
*06:21.880- 06:27.500* :  and there's a lack of even basic medicines. And just finally, even though the Israeli government is
*06:27.500- 06:31.920* :  telling people to leave the north of Gaza and head south, it's been doing that for some time now,
*06:31.920- 06:38.520* :  it is the case is it that some of its airstrikes and other attacks continue in the south. It is
*06:38.520- 06:43.100* :  targeting what it thinks is Hamas groups or affiliator groups in the south where people are going.
*06:43.520- 06:49.080* :  Yeah, I mean the airstrikes are all over. We were hearing from Mr. Abu Aluf, our BBC colleague
*06:49.080- 06:55.320* :  in Karniunis in the city in the south. So it certainly seems there's no let up at all in the south.
*06:55.320- 06:59.560* :  There'd be many fatalities. I mean in the whole of the Gaza Strip yesterday, according to health
*06:59.560- 07:06.840* :  officials, more than 300 people killed, a considerable number of those are in the south. Israel for
*07:06.840- 07:12.860* :  its part says in explanation to this that it will target Hamas wherever it knows it has infrastructure
*07:12.860- 07:18.760* :  or facilities. And I think that's why we're seeing reports from the United Nations that some people
*07:18.760- 07:23.520* :  are now simply going back to the north because at least there they think that they might still have
*07:23.520- 07:28.120* :  a home to go to. Tom Bateman in Jerusalem, well before we move on from Israel and Gaza,
*07:28.120- 07:33.440* :  here's a message from the newsrooms Jackie Leonard. Hello, this is a request for your questions
*07:33.440- 07:39.120* :  for our third special edition on what's going on in Israel and Gaza. We're getting together again
*07:39.120- 07:45.100* :  with our colleagues from the conflict podcast to try to bring some clarity to what is a very
*07:45.100- 07:51.980* :  complex situation. Anything you want explaining, record us a voice message or simply write an
*07:51.980- 07:58.820* :  email and send it to the usual address, global podcast at bbc.co.uk and we will put it to our
*07:58.820- 08:03.120* :  chief international correspondent, Lee's Doucet and other colleagues in the region covering the
*08:03.160- 08:08.920* :  story. And don't forget you can find the first two special Gaza-Israel editions of the global
*08:08.920- 08:14.360* :  news podcast wherever you found this one. Thanks Jackie. Argentina's voters appear to have
*08:14.360- 08:19.400* :  proved the opinion polls there wrong. After the first round of voting in the presidential election
*08:19.400- 08:25.380* :  at the weekend, it wasn't the populist right-wing Javier Miele who brandished a chainsaw at one event
*08:25.380- 08:31.080* :  who came out on top. Instead his rival Sergio Massa has taken the lead. With Argentina in a deep
*08:31.080- 08:37.260* :  economic crisis, inflation there is over 100%. The contest is being viewed as one of the most
*08:37.260- 08:42.260* :  important elections in decades. Our South America correspondent Katie Watson, who's in Buenos
*08:42.260- 08:51.240* :  Errors, sent this report. As the results came in, celebration. This though wasn't just a victory for
*08:51.240- 08:57.280* :  said kill Massa, but for all that came before him. People were waving flags and banging on drums
*08:57.280- 09:03.940* :  with the famous faces of peronism and Kushnerism, the political movements that define Argentina.
*09:04.960- 09:10.800* :  Hundreds of people have gathered in the streets here and many are waving blue and white flags
*09:10.800- 09:20.240* :  on long bamboo poles and it's a real Argentinian party here sort of dancing the stakes on the
*09:20.260- 09:26.840* :  Barbie in one corner. Quite next to me, there are people here selling him bananas and I think it's
*09:26.840- 09:31.660* :  just a real party atmosphere here. This was the result that a few people no matter how committed
*09:31.660- 09:35.140* :  they were to Sergio Massa winning, so coming at all.
*09:41.900- 09:46.700* :  Our country is going through a complex and difficult situation, full of challenges and difficulties.
*09:47.440- 09:52.220* :  I know that many of those who voted for us are the ones who are suffering the most. I will not fail them.
*09:56.160- 10:02.440* :  People might wonder how a man in charge of an economy with inflation running at 140% could win
*10:02.440- 10:07.100* :  this, but this result says less about Massa and more about the alternatives.
*10:11.200- 10:16.680* :  Massa is a serious project for the country. Basically the other candidates were criticizing him
*10:17.720- 10:20.620* :  and they were offering things that were not possible.
*10:25.140- 10:29.980* :  This was definitely a plot twist in Argentina's election drama. Many people saw
*10:29.980- 10:35.660* :  Javier Millet as the star of the show after his shock victory at the primaries two months ago.
*10:36.260- 10:37.920* :  No longer, but he's not giving up.
*10:41.860- 10:45.660* :  Two years ago, a few had told us that we would be competing in a second round with
*10:45.660- 10:51.240* :  Kirchnerism for the presidency of the nation. We would not have believed it. We really are witnessing
*10:51.240- 11:01.700* :  a historic event. When people went to vote on Sunday, the economic crisis was the main thing on
*11:01.700- 11:09.980* :  their minds. Few believe though that politicians can solve it. There are more and more
*11:09.980- 11:15.020* :  millionaire politicians and people are getting poorer and poorer. We need to change that equation.
*11:16.220- 11:23.760* :  We have to really, really think about it and we don't have a really good option. I didn't
*11:23.860- 11:30.540* :  came here and said I know who I'm going to vote. I was like I don't really know because nothing
*11:30.780- 11:33.760* :  needs and then I believe that nothing is good.
*11:37.360- 11:42.740* :  The party went on late into Sunday night. The hard work and campaigning starts again later this
*11:42.740- 11:47.520* :  week. There'll be another month of uncertainty until Argentina chooses a new leader.
*11:48.140- 11:52.740* :  What is clear though is whoever wins this will have a huge job on their hands
*11:53.260- 11:56.560* :  turning around an economy and population in crisis.
*11:59.700- 12:05.040* :  Katie Watson reporting every two minutes somewhere in the world a woman dies of cervical cancer
*12:05.040- 12:12.000* :  more than 300,000 each year. 90% of whom are in low and middle income countries. There is some
*12:12.000- 12:16.860* :  good news today though. There are encouraging results from a British trial that used existing
*12:16.860- 12:22.380* :  drugs to treat the cancer in a new way. Michelle Hussein spoke to Dr. Mary McCormick who led the
*12:22.380- 12:28.080* :  trial at University College London hospitals. We invited women to attend for chemotherapy
*12:28.080- 12:34.260* :  once a week, half a day a week for six weeks before giving them the current standard treatment
*12:34.260- 12:40.320* :  which is daily radiotherapy with weekly chemo. So in effect we gave additional chemotherapy for
*12:40.320- 12:46.460* :  six weeks. With that approach we found that when we looked at our progression-free survival which
*12:46.460- 12:52.180* :  is women that were alive without evidence of the cancer recurring at five years, at least one
*12:52.180- 12:59.820* :  and ten more patients alive in the group that had the additional chemotherapy. So 73% were alive
*12:59.820- 13:05.140* :  and well without the cancer recurring compared with 64% in the standard of care on.
*13:05.640- 13:10.380* :  And the important thing here is that if the patients are alive and well without the cancer
*13:10.380- 13:16.440* :  recurring at five years then they're very likely to be cured so that's what makes this very exciting
*13:16.640- 13:21.680* :  and this is the biggest improvement that we've seen in this cancer in almost 25 years.
*13:22.220- 13:28.920* :  It is so interesting because you used existing drugs and you changed the sequence as well as
*13:28.920- 13:34.440* :  bringing in that extra series of sessions of chemotherapy. What was it that made you think that
*13:34.440- 13:39.560* :  that could yield a different result? Well there were some suggestions from trials that were done
*13:39.560- 13:46.700* :  many years ago that giving chemotherapy before radiation might improve outcome but the trials
*13:46.700- 13:51.560* :  are very small and the results are conflicting. So we went back and looked at that again and thought
*13:51.560- 13:57.240* :  how can we make this better? And we can give the drugs every week instead of every three weeks.
*13:57.700- 14:02.360* :  We can give it over a shorter period of time. In addition one of the drugs that Packley
*14:02.360- 14:08.200* :  Taxel wasn't available sort of 25 years ago when all of those other trials were done and we know
*14:08.200- 14:14.460* :  that this is a very active drug and it's associated with a high response rate in cervical cancer.
*14:14.460- 14:20.920* :  So we put this more active drug in. We gave the drugs every week and we eliminated that big gap
*14:20.920- 14:26.340* :  between the chemo and the radiation. So I think just making those changes has really been
*14:26.340- 14:31.820* :  what's made the difference. Dr. Mary McCormick with a little bit of good news about the treatment of
*14:31.820- 14:40.100* :  cervical cancer. Still to come the acoustic ecologist who's documenting wildlife habitats
*14:40.100- 14:46.820* :  and the impact of humans. Habitats that no longer exist. The animals have been poached.
*14:47.940- 14:51.460* :  That whole herd that I had in the original recording is gone now.
*15:00.440- 15:06.420* :  The explanation is the podcast from the BBC World Service that goes beyond the spin,
*15:06.420- 15:12.960* :  exploring the important questions about long running stories and the latest global news.
*15:12.960- 15:21.080* :  An honest explanation of the events shaping our lives. Search for the explanation wherever you get
*15:21.080- 15:29.700* :  your BBC podcast. Welcome back to this podcast, the global news podcast. Pakistan's former
*15:29.700- 15:34.860* :  Prime Minister Imran Khan is facing more criminal charges. A court has decided that he will stand
*15:34.860- 15:40.040* :  trial on claims that he leaked classified documents that damaged the country's diplomatic relations.
*15:40.040- 15:45.140* :  It was only a few months ago that he was convicted of corruption. His sentence for that was
*15:45.140- 15:50.980* :  suspended, although he remained in prison awaiting a decision on this new case. Our Pakistan correspondent
*15:50.980- 15:54.820* :  Caroline Davis is in Islamabad and she told me more about the new charges.
*15:56.080- 16:00.700* :  Imran Khan and Jamah Mood Kureshi who is his foreign minister. So both former Prime Minister,
*16:00.700- 16:04.940* :  former foreign minister were both indicted to date, which means of course that they are going to
*16:05.400- 16:12.320* :  stand trial on these two charges. Now the accusation is that Imran Khan leaked classified documents
*16:12.320- 16:17.520* :  and then subsequently the second accusation is that that damaged diplomatic relations.
*16:18.200- 16:23.180* :  This is all in relation to, it's been referred to as the cipher case. So back in March 2022,
*16:23.880- 16:30.180* :  Imran Khan appeared on stage at a rally, waving a piece of paper, which he said contained evidence
*16:30.180- 16:34.960* :  that there was a foreign power, there was a conspiracy against his government by a foreign power.
*16:35.040- 16:39.740* :  He said that the letter essentially detailed the fact that if Imran Khan was
*16:39.740- 16:44.340* :  rude from power that all would be forgiven, those were the words that he used when describing
*16:44.340- 16:49.340* :  what was in that letter. Now the court and the authorities have now alleged that that means
*16:49.340- 16:55.060* :  that Imran Khan has leaked classified information. If he is found guilty of doing that, there is a
*16:55.060- 17:01.960* :  maximum sentence of two years, but importantly the second charge is that that as a result damaged
*17:01.960- 17:07.240* :  diplomatic relations, that has a maximum sentence of either life imprisonment or the death penalty.
*17:07.240- 17:12.240* :  At the time did anything happen though, or is this this has only come to light relatively recently?
*17:12.420- 17:17.020* :  The case and the fact that Imran Khan was potentially going to be indicted or charged on this case,
*17:17.360- 17:21.780* :  that's been a relatively recent case that's been brought forward. So the way that the court
*17:21.780- 17:26.840* :  procedures work in Pakistan is that the four people are officially charged or indicted for trial,
*17:26.840- 17:32.260* :  there have to be documents presented and Imran Khan is currently in prison in the build-up to
*17:32.260- 17:37.420* :  this indictment and relation to this particular case. But now this has been a relatively
*17:37.420- 17:42.940* :  recent case. This has not been something that was brought up back in March 2022. This has been
*17:42.940- 17:47.240* :  something that's been happening this year. Quickly just reminded, so he's in jail for corruption,
*17:47.240- 17:51.600* :  but he was going to be released, but he's stayed in jail awaiting trial on these new charges.
*17:52.080- 17:56.540* :  So there's been lots of different court cases against Imran Khan. He was firstly put into jail
*17:56.540- 18:02.020* :  in August, so just under three months ago, and that was when he was found guilty in the case
*18:02.020- 18:05.960* :  as referred to as the Doshakana case of not having correctly registered money he gained from selling
*18:05.960- 18:12.160* :  state gifts. That sentence was then suspended awaiting appeal, although it still technically stands,
*18:12.160- 18:17.160* :  he's just not currently in prison on that case, but because he was also awaiting this decision
*18:17.160- 18:20.620* :  about whether he was going to be indicted and what we've been referring to as the cipher case,
*18:20.620- 18:26.260* :  he was in prison waiting for that as well. So it's all quite confusing, but ultimately he is in prison,
*18:26.260- 18:30.540* :  nearly been imprisoned for three months, and bear in mind that he's also disqualified from running
*18:30.540- 18:35.480* :  from election, and the general elections are expecting to hear in Pakistan in early next year.
*18:36.120- 18:41.480* :  Caroline Davies reporting, now here's a figure for you, less than 2% of genetic information studied
*18:41.960- 18:47.240* :  comes from people of African descent, and that has repercussions on medical research and treating
*18:47.240- 18:53.140* :  people of African descent. To remedy this, scientists are planning a new initiative to collect genetic
*18:53.140- 18:58.400* :  material from half a million African people to create what researchers believe will be the world's
*18:58.400- 19:04.920* :  largest database of population genomic information. A quasi-Sapong spoke to Anal Shankar of
*19:04.920- 19:08.580* :  Mejari Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, which is behind this study.
*19:09.420- 19:16.320* :  The first human population that amigrated out was from northeast Africa. So in that respect,
*19:16.320- 19:22.800* :  the human diaspora that exists on Earth today basically has some African ancestry,
*19:23.040- 19:31.680* :  and that variation in this human diaspora, right now we cannot study because we do not have
*19:31.680- 19:39.740* :  the data set. So this reference genome data set from African ancestry population will allow us
*19:39.740- 19:48.860* :  to study that. It is quite shocking that less than 2% of DNA and genomics of people of African descent
*19:49.500- 19:54.360* :  has been known. What has that been down to? Is it because people of that descent have been
*19:54.360- 19:59.900* :  reluctant to provide that kind of data, all the scientific medical community has just been
*19:59.900- 20:06.020* :  unable to gather that kind of data? So it has been for two reasons. First, African people or
*20:06.020- 20:12.420* :  African ancestry people or African Americans in the US were not asked to participate in any
*20:12.420- 20:17.860* :  studies that were done here, and so they are missing. And some of the historical mistrust
*20:17.860- 20:24.020* :  created by, for example, the infamous syphilis study at Tuskegee University and the neighborhood
*20:24.020- 20:30.380* :  of that university that created a mistrust. So African people did not want to participate, but
*20:30.380- 20:37.820* :  the younger generation understands that that is so crucial to advancing science, and that is crucial
*20:38.320- 20:43.800* :  to discover treatments for African ancestry population because they do not exist at this point
*20:44.060- 20:51.200* :  or it is not clear if the treatments would work on them. For example, for diseases, we
*20:51.200- 20:59.000* :  assess risk by polygenic risk score, and it is well-established now that that is 25% accurate
*20:59.540- 21:06.620* :  for African ancestry population because all the standards and modeling was done on European
*21:06.620- 21:13.860* :  ancestry population. And if you're looking at gathering the data of about 500,000 people
*21:13.860- 21:19.760* :  over here, there's a lot of data who will own this data, how will this be managed? We have
*21:19.760- 21:27.780* :  established a new institute called the Diaspora Human Genomics Institute. So that institute will
*21:27.780- 21:36.700* :  govern and store this data, and all those DHGI functions will be governed by an ethics committee,
*21:37.440- 21:41.800* :  and the control will stay in the hands of people of African ancestry.
*21:42.620- 21:45.280* :  And how long would it take to collect this genetic material then?
*21:45.820- 21:49.160* :  For now, the goal is to complete this in next five years.
*21:49.940- 21:56.080* :  And Elshankar. Now, since the 1970s, Bernie Krauss has made over 5,000 hours of sound recordings,
*21:56.080- 22:02.400* :  documenting wildlife habitats around the world. Many of those habitats have now fallen silent,
*22:02.400- 22:07.000* :  victims of the shift in human activity. Our correspondent, Nicholas Dambridge,
*22:07.000- 22:12.000* :  met Bernie Krauss to talk about a new collaborative exhibition of his work here in London.
*22:15.640- 22:21.540* :  Descending into darkness at 180 studios in London with sounds from the Sengar Sengar Forest
*22:22.180- 22:29.240* :  in the Central African Republic, captured by Louis Sano, produced by acoustic ecologist and author
*22:29.240- 22:36.000* :  of the Great Animal Orchestra, Bernie Krauss. We had Western lowland guerrilla, African gray
*22:36.000- 22:46.260* :  parrots, Hadada Ibus, greater spotted monkey, and Guinea Turaco. All brought flickering to life
*22:46.260- 22:53.440* :  with hovering glowing lines of light, an installation designed by united visual artists, Matt Clark.
*22:54.300- 23:01.620* :  On the floor is an array of small discrete speakers, and that's where the sounds of crickets,
*23:02.440- 23:10.020* :  frogs, birds call from. And then there's also an outer array of speakers where you get wind,
*23:10.160- 23:15.680* :  chainsaws in the distance, planes flying overhead, and really it's an interplay between
*23:16.580- 23:23.620* :  the man-made noises and forests. The structure is meant to represent a kind of monument to nature
*23:23.620- 23:31.240* :  which we can orchestrate like a like a sonic rewording. And as we hear the insects, you can see
*23:32.080- 23:38.060* :  green lights, very soothing, very calming. As you hear the airplanes going over, they turn white,
*23:38.060- 23:43.880* :  they become quite bristle to the eye, actually, to look at. And really it sort of demonstrates,
*23:44.960- 23:49.840* :  you know, we can live in harmony through the noise we make, but we can also disrupt nature.
*23:51.120- 23:59.300* :  Matt and his team have created an algorithm that allows you and the audience to see the sound
*23:59.300- 24:07.180* :  and its effect. Some of the recordings of the Bayerka tribe who actually sort of make a lot of noise,
*24:07.180- 24:14.440* :  music, but it's in harmony with the natural surroundings. We learn orchestration, melody, rhythm,
*24:14.440- 24:19.700* :  all of these things from the sounds of the natural world when we live much more closely.
*24:20.020- 24:26.120* :  So it's really an epic story of, you know, how these habitats are devastated by
*24:26.900- 24:33.020* :  human endeavor. And the rainforest has been compromised because of extraction of hardwoods,
*24:33.200- 24:40.040* :  habitats that no longer exist. The animals have been poached, like the elephants, for instance,
*24:41.040- 24:44.560* :  that whole herd that I had in the original recording is gone now.
*24:46.340- 24:53.880* :  In Louis' recording, so for time from 1984 to the time that he died, you can hear the sounds of
*24:53.880- 25:01.940* :  the rainforest diminish. And then there's one of your other famous sounds over the doors.
*25:06.200- 25:12.760* :  When we watch Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Apocalypse Now, which you created with Walter Merch and
*25:12.760- 25:17.300* :  others, I programmed the material for about a third of the score and did the hillcopter sounds.
*25:17.480- 25:22.820* :  I created that sound on the Mogue synthesizer, my late music partner Paul Beaver,
*25:23.380- 25:32.200* :  and I had introduced the synthesizer to pop music and film in 1967. So here I am funded by Coppola
*25:32.200- 25:42.820* :  in that regard. That report by Nicholas Dambridge. Now let's end on a master, a master of movement,
*25:42.820- 25:49.080* :  mockery and music, all of it on film. Charlie Chaplin was probably the most famous man in the world
*25:49.080- 25:54.960* :  at the high point of his prolific career in mostly silent movies, which started more than 100 years
*25:54.960- 26:00.280* :  ago. Well later this week his cane and an outsized suit which he wore to create the iconic
*26:00.280- 26:04.020* :  tramp will go up for auction in the north of England, his Wendy Erkert.
*26:11.100- 26:18.240* :  Charlie Chaplin was an icon of the silent film era. He starred in 93 films and directed 72 of them
*26:18.240- 26:24.900* :  including The Kid, a woman of Paris and the great dictator. His clothes, hat and cane and his
*26:24.900- 26:30.840* :  penguin walk are as famous as his movies. Chaplin's parents were both musical entertainers,
*26:31.120- 26:37.100* :  so perhaps it's not surprising that he sought the limelight, but his route to stardom was far from
*26:37.100- 26:44.000* :  easy. He grew up in abject poverty in London, his parents separated early on, and at the age of seven
*26:44.000- 26:49.780* :  he was sent to Lambeth Workhouse, a bleak institution providing work and shelter for the poor.
*26:50.380- 26:55.360* :  Charlie's mum was later committed to an asylum, and he spent his childhood at a school for the
*26:55.360- 27:00.960* :  destitute. It was around that time that he started performing on stage, and the showby's contacts
*27:00.960- 27:06.940* :  that his parents had made proved to be a lifeline, allowing him to tour musicals around England.
*27:07.660- 27:12.720* :  But it was the famous suit that was several sizes too big, that Charlie wore as the little
*27:12.720- 27:19.260* :  tramp in the stage production of the mumming birds in California in 1910 that made him a household
*27:19.260- 27:25.060* :  name. He borrowed the suit from fellow actor Billy Richie and returned it when the production ended.
*27:25.180- 27:31.700* :  Four years later he reprised the role wearing a different suit in The Kid Auto Races at Venice,
*27:32.160- 27:39.720* :  and he became a global phenomenon. When Billy Richie died in 1921, his widow gave the original suit
*27:39.720- 27:46.180* :  bowler hat and bamboo cane to the London stage dorm and Harry Brown for his private museum.
*27:46.220- 27:54.360* :  The cane was signed by Chaplin in 1952, and it's expected to sell for around $24,000 at auction.
*27:55.060- 28:00.660* :  The original suit worn by Charlie Chaplin in his first ever portrayal of the tramp is causing a real
*28:00.660- 28:06.060* :  buzz in the auction world, but if you're thinking of bidding for one of the most iconic pieces of
*28:06.060- 28:14.680* :  film memorabilia, be prepared to dig deep because it's estimated to rake in at least $145,000.
*28:20.480- 28:24.640* :  And that's it from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*28:24.640- 28:29.600* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*28:29.600- 28:35.200* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk, and you can also find us on X,
*28:35.200- 28:40.440* :  formerly known as Twitter at Global NewsPod. This edition was mixed by Matt Dean and produced by
*28:40.440- 28:45.500* :  Judy Franco, the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Robin Brandt, until next time, thanks for being with us,
*28:45.640- 28:45.840* :  goodbye.
