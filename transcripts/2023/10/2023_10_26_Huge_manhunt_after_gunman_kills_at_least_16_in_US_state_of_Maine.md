*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.940* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.620- 00:24.040* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 1300 hours GMT on the 26th of October, these are our main stories.
*00:24.600- 00:29.040* :  A huge manhunt is underway in the American state of Maine following a mass shooting.
*00:29.400- 00:33.620* :  Our shades are down, our doors are locked, our windows are locked. We've got the majority of
*00:33.620- 00:39.480* :  interior lights off. We'll get the latest from our correspondent in the US. Israel says its
*00:39.480- 00:45.860* :  incursion into Gaza overnight is the biggest since war broke out. We'll also hear about Pakistan's
*00:45.860- 00:53.640* :  plans to deport all illegal immigrants, many to Afghanistan. Also in this podcast, we have elections
*00:53.660- 01:01.740* :  and it's a choice between two guys that in the late 70s and early 80s and they say that's
*01:01.740- 01:08.060* :  pitiful because where's the young crowd. Former Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his
*01:08.060- 01:16.720* :  verdict on the US presidential race. As we record this podcast, a major manhunt is underway in the US
*01:16.720- 01:21.740* :  state of Maine. Hundreds of police are looking for a man who's thought to have carried out a series
*01:21.740- 01:28.080* :  of shootings in Lewiston that have left at least 16 people dead. Dozens are also injured and
*01:28.080- 01:33.560* :  armed police are stationed outside the local hospital. Officials have named a man 40-year-old
*01:33.560- 01:39.380* :  Robert Card as a person of interest and described him as armed and dangerous. He's an army
*01:39.380- 01:45.520* :  reservist who recently spent time in a mental health facility. People living in Lewiston have
*01:45.520- 01:51.340* :  been told to stay indoors and businesses have shut their doors. Shana Cox is sheltering at home
*01:51.340- 01:56.340* :  with her children and she told the BBC what precautions she's taking. Our shades are down,
*01:56.340- 02:02.140* :  our doors are locked, our windows are locked. We've got the majority of interior lights off and we're
*02:02.240- 02:07.040* :  ensuring that no one's leaving the home. I have a couple of my children's friends here tonight
*02:07.040- 02:12.560* :  because this is the place they were at seven o'clock when when everything began and I'm sure
*02:12.560- 02:17.300* :  my story is like so many others. An ortho-america correspondent David Willis Pildes-Borne.
*02:17.540- 02:24.760* :  They have identified a 40-year-old man Robert Card as a person of interest in this incident.
*02:24.760- 02:32.860* :  He is an army reservist. He's a certified army firearms instructor who was known apparently
*02:32.860- 02:39.400* :  by local law enforcement officers to be suffering from mental health issues. Now he's been deemed
*02:39.400- 02:47.120* :  armed and dangerous by officials as I say a man hunt underway involving hundreds of police
*02:47.120- 02:54.300* :  officers in the state of Maine. Schools have been closed for the day. Local residents have been
*02:54.300- 03:02.640* :  urged to stay indoors. It's an extremely worrying, terrifying situation for many people in this
*03:02.880- 03:08.920* :  fairly small community. And what's the latest on casualties? Well we know that at least 16
*03:08.920- 03:16.160* :  people have died. There are reports in the media here that it could be 20 or perhaps more than
*03:16.160- 03:24.080* :  that. And around 50 people are said to have been injured in these two attacks. They attack
*03:24.540- 03:33.420* :  on the bowling alley and attack on a local bar and grill. But they've set up a center for
*03:33.500- 03:42.120* :  relatives of the people to coalesce and find out details about their loved ones. And apparently
*03:42.120- 03:49.820* :  there has been a lot of heartache as you can imagine. It is early in the morning still here
*03:50.080- 03:55.840* :  on the east coast of America. And as you mentioned Val, people are waking up to this. What is
*03:55.840- 04:03.580* :  already the deadliest mass shooting of the more than 500 that the United States has seen so far
*04:03.580- 04:09.540* :  this year. A mass shooting is defined as one in which four or more people are either killed or
*04:09.540- 04:17.960* :  wounded. This is a country in which gun violence is shockingly alarmingly common. Where there are
*04:17.960- 04:25.020* :  more guns would you believe than people. But calls to tighten the gun control laws here are
*04:25.020- 04:30.980* :  invariably opposed by Republican members of Congress who defend the constitutional right to
*04:30.980- 04:38.180* :  bear arms. David Willis in the US. Israel says its incursion into Gaza overnight was its largest
*04:38.180- 04:44.700* :  operation since the war broke out almost three weeks ago. The military claims it's hit 250
*04:44.700- 04:51.460* :  Hamas targets in the past 24 hours. The health authorities in Gaza, which Hamas runs, say more than
*04:51.460- 04:57.200* :  7,000 people have been killed in the conflict so far. Israel has been talking about an invasion
*04:57.200- 05:04.180* :  for some time. But there's internal and external pressure on the country to act and not to act.
*05:04.580- 05:09.860* :  I'm at least analyst Sebastian Asher explains. There's an imperative felt within Israel to a large
*05:09.900- 05:15.140* :  degree to take the strongest ever action that it has against Hamas not to do what it's done in
*05:15.140- 05:22.300* :  the past, which is essentially to pound Gaza for a few weeks, possibly a month or so, in which time
*05:22.300- 05:26.860* :  large numbers of Palestinian civilians will be killed as well as Hamas members. And obviously
*05:26.860- 05:31.880* :  we've seen that to a greater extent than we've seen previously. We're talking about from figures
*05:32.240- 05:36.860* :  from inside Gaza six and a half thousand people, more than six and a half thousand people have
*05:36.860- 05:43.120* :  been killed there. That imperative remains. And the Israeli government has said that it wants to
*05:43.120- 05:47.980* :  eradicate Hamas. It still stays by that. But the question is, is that actually an achievable
*05:47.980- 05:53.300* :  option? And I think that is part of the reason why we saw a very fast mobilization, hundreds of
*05:53.300- 05:57.800* :  thousands on the Gaza border, other sent up onto the northern border in case there's an attack by
*05:57.800- 06:03.380* :  has but a major attack. But we've seen them waiting. We've seen the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*06:03.380- 06:07.980* :  we've seen the Defence Minister, you have gone and go there almost daily and say it's coming. Wait.
*06:07.980- 06:14.280* :  But the waiting is raising questions in Israel and beyond. Is this really what the Israeli government,
*06:14.280- 06:20.300* :  is this what the Israeli military is now planning? Now overnight we had this biggest incursion so far
*06:20.300- 06:25.400* :  by Israel. They went in with tanks and they came out. Are they going to start doing that more as time
*06:25.400- 06:29.640* :  goes on and trying to grade and show that they're degrading in a bigger way than they have before
*06:29.640- 06:36.180* :  Hamas? Or are they still ready to take this huge challenge on of trying to completely eradicate
*06:36.180- 06:41.760* :  Hamas? That will involve going deep down underground in Gaza. This immense network of tunnels that
*06:41.760- 06:47.080* :  Hamas has created that and fighting in the most difficult possible terrain. Now they're trained for
*06:47.080- 06:52.680* :  this. They have a place in Israel where they practice this. So that is something that they can
*06:52.680- 06:58.520* :  deal with. But the cost, casualties, not just inside Gaza to Palestinians, but we've seen
*06:58.860- 07:03.200* :  but to Israeli soldiers could be meant and the hostages. What will happen to the hostages?
*07:03.920- 07:09.300* :  Sebastian Asher. We've just been hearing about the humanitarian position in Gaza but what's
*07:09.300- 07:14.300* :  it like for people living there? Well, Justin Webb has been speaking to a Gaza resident who
*07:14.300- 07:23.560* :  were calling Sab. Since our house was bombed, it was 13 of October and I lost my dad that day so we came
*07:23.560- 07:30.780* :  to my aunt's house. We stayed here with my two or three sisters all together with their kids.
*07:30.780- 07:37.940* :  These hard times we try to stay families together to feel time that's safer and to be honest,
*07:37.940- 07:44.100* :  if we die, let's say die together. We also believe in this since no shelter or safe places in Gaza.
*07:44.660- 07:50.680* :  So we try to feel safe by each other. But at the same time, we try to keep some members of the
*07:50.680- 07:58.320* :  house or some members of the family in another house that if we die, let's not die also all together.
*07:58.340- 08:03.520* :  Like let's at least keep someone to keep the life and to keep the message after us.
*08:04.700- 08:09.620* :  I can hear children in the background there. So what are you saying to them about what's going on?
*08:09.760- 08:15.040* :  What really hurts us are the children. Unfortunately, nowadays there is no children. They are the
*08:15.040- 08:23.360* :  girl of many years in 20 days. But we try to keep them somehow not that too much worried. We try to
*08:23.360- 08:28.900* :  calm them down as much as we can, keep them busy together, playing or doing anything.
*08:29.640- 08:35.340* :  So that they don't pay attention to whatever happened. Even when they hear sounds,
*08:35.340- 08:40.140* :  sometimes they see it because it is so near us, but sometimes when they don't see it,
*08:40.140- 08:47.560* :  we try to just tell them that it's not pumping, it's just another sound. So we try to comfort them
*08:47.560- 08:51.980* :  as much as we can. Are you able to give them enough to eat and to drink?
*08:52.780- 08:57.620* :  To get everything in us is a challenge, to get the water is a challenge, to get the food is a
*08:57.620- 09:03.980* :  challenge, to get the bread is a challenge, to get the electricity, that everything is a challenge,
*09:03.980- 09:11.320* :  to stay alive is the biggest challenge in Gaza nowadays. What do you think that the outside world
*09:11.320- 09:16.880* :  should be saying and doing now, because you're someone who has lived in the outside world,
*09:16.880- 09:22.660* :  you went back to Gaza, didn't you? You lived abroad. What do you think should be happening now?
*09:22.960- 09:31.200* :  They must stop this. I have no idea, but those people suffering, those people have a right to
*09:31.200- 09:38.120* :  stay alive. Those people, no matter what we must keep them alive, we must keep them safe,
*09:38.280- 09:44.320* :  because a soul is a soul, and a human is a human. We have to see them like this, because now they
*09:44.320- 09:50.320* :  are dying. I don't want to say like any amount, but like nothing. They are dying literally like nothing.
*09:51.440- 09:57.820* :  Sab, speaking to us from Gaza. Well, the BBC's director General Tim Davy has attended a
*09:57.820- 10:02.320* :  meeting of politicians from the UK's governing Conservative Party to discuss the
*10:02.320- 10:08.360* :  corporation's coverage of the conflict. Members of the 1922 committee express concern that the
*10:08.360- 10:14.460* :  BBC doesn't describe Hamas as terrorists. The BBC does include the word terrorist in its coverage,
*10:14.460- 10:19.660* :  but only when it's attributed to others. Here's our media correspondent, David Syleto.
*10:20.200- 10:26.320* :  One MP described it as a forthright exchange of views. The meeting which took place behind closed
*10:26.320- 10:31.420* :  doors had been planned long before recent events in Israel, and the coverage of migration and
*10:31.420- 10:37.520* :  local radio cuts were all discussed, but the MP's main concern was the word terrorist. There was,
*10:37.520- 10:42.400* :  it was said, deep disappointment that the BBC didn't simply call Hamas terrorists.
*10:43.260- 10:48.760* :  Tim Davy said the word was far from banned, but the corporation took care to say who was describing
*10:48.760- 10:54.720* :  someone as a terrorist. BBC reports regularly refer to Hamas as being a prescribed terrorist
*10:55.460- 11:01.400* :  organisation by the UK government. However, many were far from one over. One said, if there was one
*11:01.400- 11:07.140* :  thing that managed to unite Conservative MPs, it was the BBC refusing to simply declare that Hamas
*11:07.140- 11:15.760* :  were terrorists. David Syleto. Coming up. This wasn't a typical money laundering
*11:15.760- 11:21.260* :  organisation that was operating in the shadows. This was operating essentially in the high
*11:21.260- 11:25.040* :  street. The criminals who are arguably too successful.
*11:32.700- 11:35.720* :  A year on from the deadly crowdcrush in South Korea,
*11:35.720- 11:40.160* :  its survivors have told the BBC that they are still traumatised by what happened,
*11:40.160- 11:46.320* :  and lack of answers is making it difficult for them to heal. Nearly 160 young people were killed
*11:46.320- 11:51.700* :  when they became trapped in an overcrowded alleyway in Seoul as they celebrated Halloween.
*11:52.400- 11:55.820* :  Despite well-documented failings, no one has been held responsible,
*11:55.820- 12:01.840* :  although the authorities insist that they have made changes ahead of this weekend's Halloween
*12:01.840- 12:05.540* :  celebrations. A so-called correspondent, Jean McKenzie reports.
*12:23.000- 12:27.760* :  There are so many screams who has helped me. I don't want to die.
*12:30.100- 12:35.600* :  This is the sound of the alley that night, their confusion and fear, as people funneled in from
*12:35.600- 12:40.980* :  three directions. The pressure of the crush was so great it ruptured the muscles and nerves
*12:40.980- 12:44.900* :  in both Julian's legs, paralyzing them for two months.
*12:56.580- 13:03.100* :  Nearly 160 people died that night, but a year on, thousands more still carry physical and
*13:03.100- 13:12.000* :  emotional scars. This is Jinsung, who was caught in the crush with his mother and younger sister.
*13:12.460- 13:16.140* :  As he focused on keeping his mother alive, his sister was killed.
*13:19.120- 13:22.420* :  Initially, I wasn't able to leave the house. I was very scared at night.
*13:23.160- 13:29.480* :  A small sound would paralyze me. Sometimes I still remember the look of my mom not being
*13:29.480- 13:35.700* :  able to breathe. Over time, Jinsung says his grief and fear have been overtaken by anger.
*13:38.080- 13:43.580* :  The emergency services finally arrived on the scene, but an investigation found they came too late.
*13:43.580- 13:48.000* :  The investigation also concluded that despite predicting danger,
*13:48.480- 13:53.220* :  the authorities had failed to prepare for this event, and while various low-level officials
*13:53.220- 13:57.600* :  are being investigated for this, still no one has been held responsible.
*13:58.300- 14:02.960* :  And the survivors in the bereaved say they've been stonewalled as the authorities have tried to
*14:02.960- 14:11.080* :  shift the blame. In the centre of Seoul here, a memorial has been set up and with photos of most
*14:11.080- 14:16.600* :  of those who died that night. But it's not an official memorial. It's been set up by the
*14:16.620- 14:23.120* :  families, and ever since, they've been taking it in turns to stand guard here 24 hours a day
*14:23.120- 14:28.840* :  to stop the authorities from trying to remove it. Today, it's Song Hyejins turn.
*14:29.420- 14:34.480* :  Hyejins' teenage son survived the crush, but his best friend and his girlfriend were killed.
*14:35.120- 14:38.540* :  Unable to cope with the trauma, he then took his own life.
*14:41.180- 14:47.220* :  He was a completely different boy after the tragedy. Before he was a very bright,
*14:47.340- 14:50.840* :  talkative kid, but afterwards, hardly ever spoke.
*14:52.380- 14:57.600* :  The government and the local authority ultimately failed in their duty to protect lives,
*14:58.600- 15:04.640* :  and there's been no accountability or apology for that at all. We need to know what happened,
*15:04.640- 15:07.160* :  and who was responsible in order to heal.
*15:12.000- 15:17.160* :  We have asked the national government, the local government, and the police to talk to us
*15:17.640- 15:22.860* :  to tell us what lessons they've learned and how they plan to keep people safe this Halloween,
*15:23.720- 15:28.040* :  but they've all declined. They've told us that this isn't the right time to talk.
*15:29.820- 15:36.060* :  There's a sign at the end of the alleyway, and it reads, if we don't remember, history will repeat
*15:36.100- 15:42.420* :  itself, and that's a big concern here, that unless people take responsibility,
*15:43.420- 15:47.540* :  then Korea is vulnerable to another one of these disasters happening.
*15:49.460- 15:56.260* :  Jeanne McKenzie, an unusual addition of George Orwell's novel 1984 is going on sale at a charity
*15:56.260- 16:03.040* :  shop in Wales. The artist David Triggley has pulped 6,000 copies of Dan Brown's best seller,
*16:03.040- 16:09.160* :  the Da Vinci code, and republished them as the dystopian classic. David Triggley says the project
*16:09.160- 16:14.600* :  is an exploration of what can happen to a highly successful book in the years after it's published.
*16:14.700- 16:18.600* :  Our entertainment correspondent, Colin Patterson, has been to meet the artist.
*16:18.620- 16:24.340* :  In 2017, an Oxfam shop in Swansea put up a sign asking for people to stop
*16:24.340- 16:30.240* :  donating copies off the Da Vinci code because they had so many. This gave the artist David
*16:30.240- 16:36.320* :  Triggley an idea, and he started collecting them, ending up with more than 6,000.
*16:36.680- 16:40.800* :  There's a problem with an unwanted book that is going to get pulped anyway, but it's interesting
*16:40.800- 16:46.460* :  to take one book and make it into one specific other book, and it was my decision to make 1984
*16:46.460- 16:50.100* :  with it, because I think it's still a really important book for people to read.
*16:50.460- 16:55.440* :  Because it's more than 70 years since George Orwell died, his work is in the public domain,
*16:55.440- 17:01.400* :  meaning that David Triggley was able to recycle the Da Vinci codes into 1,200
*17:01.400- 17:08.600* :  hardbacks of a new 1984 edition. The twist, this Saturday, they will be sold in the same
*17:08.600- 17:15.020* :  Oxfam store, which originally put up the sign. Colin Patterson, the Pakistani government says
*17:15.020- 17:21.020* :  it's finalised a plan to expel all illegal immigrants from next month. Most of the undocumented
*17:21.020- 17:26.080* :  migrants thought to number more than a million people are from Afghanistan. The government's
*17:26.080- 17:30.940* :  going ahead with the extraditions, despite calls from the UN, to halt deportations of Afghan
*17:30.940- 17:35.820* :  nationals, saying they face security and economic issues back in their home country.
*17:36.360- 17:40.860* :  I asked our South Asia editor and barrison etharajan about Pakistan's plans.
*17:41.600- 17:46.100* :  It's a big challenge, the government admits, that we are talking about more than a million people.
*17:46.240- 17:51.980* :  In fact, the Pakistani government talks about 1.7 million illegal immigrants. Most of them
*17:52.280- 17:57.140* :  are Afghan nationals. They had fled that country over the years during the Taliban regime,
*17:57.140- 18:02.960* :  in the late 90s, and also during the war between the US-led forces and the Taliban.
*18:02.960- 18:09.480* :  And after the Taliban took over in August 2021, more than half a million people had now fled
*18:09.480- 18:13.840* :  to neighbouring Pakistan. Where are they living? Mostly they are living in Kaibir Paktun
*18:13.900- 18:18.820* :  province, which borders Afghanistan, and also in Balochistan. And there are tens of thousands
*18:18.820- 18:23.400* :  of people in the city like Karachi, where many of them are involved in business. They have settled,
*18:23.400- 18:27.100* :  they have their families, they have their businesses, they have formed a community.
*18:27.680- 18:32.500* :  And now these people are worried what will happen when they go back, because the economy has not
*18:32.500- 18:36.940* :  started really enough. Afghanistan seems to Taliban take over. And there are security issues.
*18:36.940- 18:41.520* :  And most importantly, what will happen to the children's education? Will the women,
*18:41.520- 18:46.260* :  the girls children, will they be allowed to school? These are some of the worries faced by the
*18:46.260- 18:51.300* :  Afghans, but the government of Pakistan says they have to leave by the first week of November.
*18:52.180- 18:56.020* :  And what is the government going to do? Is it just going to go house to house and ask people
*18:56.020- 19:00.600* :  for the documents? Now what the government is saying they are now carrying out in various
*19:01.580- 19:07.180* :  surveys about where these people are. And now Pakistani media says hundreds of Afghans have been
*19:07.180- 19:12.540* :  taken into custody, those who the government deems that these are undocumented migrants. But
*19:12.540- 19:17.760* :  the government also insists that they will not take any action against those who have refugee
*19:17.760- 19:22.500* :  status. And also those who Afghan nationals with the valid documents, those who are staying in
*19:22.500- 19:28.040* :  the country. But they are going only after those undocumented Afghan nationals. Now why this
*19:28.080- 19:33.300* :  happened? Because now the Afghan, the Pakistani government talks about a number of suicide attacks
*19:33.300- 19:37.860* :  in the country. And many of them they say they were linked to Afghan nationals. And that was
*19:37.860- 19:43.060* :  one of the trigger points. And the second point is about Pakistani Taliban militants carried out
*19:43.060- 19:48.760* :  large-scale attacks in the bordering areas. And they came from Afghanistan according to the
*19:48.760- 19:55.740* :  Pakistani officials. So they are very angry with Afghan Taliban for not taking action against them.
*19:55.740- 20:00.200* :  So these are some of the trigger points which led to this government's decision. But the government
*20:00.200- 20:05.800* :  says no we need to take decisive action against these illegal immigrants. Is there sympathy for them?
*20:06.660- 20:10.840* :  There are many people because it's very complicated. It's not simply about Afghan nationals.
*20:10.840- 20:15.460* :  There are people who are married to local Pakistani women. And also they do businesses. And the
*20:15.460- 20:20.860* :  children grew up in Pakistan for the last 20 years. And there are people like for example some of
*20:20.860- 20:25.900* :  the political parties, Islamist parties are saying no they should not be driven back to Afghanistan
*20:25.900- 20:31.900* :  where they will face more problems. And as they talked about like education, security and economy
*20:31.900- 20:36.560* :  and these people have settled in Pakistan itself for a long time. And there are people who are
*20:36.560- 20:41.940* :  talking about especially the UN and rights group say they should not be forced to go back to Afghanistan.
*20:42.840- 20:49.580* :  And Barassan, Efer Arjun. Sometimes you can be arguably just too successful for your own good.
*20:49.580- 20:54.620* :  At least that's the lesson that could be drawn from the arrest in Australia of seven members of
*20:54.620- 20:59.540* :  a suspected Chinese money laundering syndicate. They came to the police's attention when the
*20:59.540- 21:04.520* :  open new currency exchange shops during lockdown when everyone else's businesses were suffering
*21:04.520- 21:11.980* :  badly. As Phil Mercer and Sidney told me. The allegation is that this syndicate was operating as
*21:12.000- 21:19.480* :  the authorities here in Australia have been describing in plain sight with shopfronts in about
*21:19.480- 21:27.500* :  a dozen locations across the country. Investigators say that this wasn't a typical money laundering
*21:27.680- 21:33.340* :  organization that was operating in the shadows. This was operating essentially in the high street.
*21:33.340- 21:39.380* :  Now Australian detective say that they were first alerted when this money transfer business
*21:39.380- 21:46.240* :  started expanding during COVID-19 lockdowns even though many of its international tourist
*21:46.720- 21:52.540* :  and student customers had left the country. So this is an investigation that has spanned 14
*21:52.540- 21:58.600* :  months. And in the last day or so we've seen hundreds of police officers and other specialists
*21:59.380- 22:05.900* :  radar properties across five Australian states culminating in the arrest of seven members
*22:06.300- 22:10.960* :  of this alleged Chinese crime syndicate. They were turning over a lot of money, weren't they?
*22:11.160- 22:19.020* :  The allegation is that what's known here is the Long River Gang laundered more than 140
*22:19.020- 22:26.800* :  million US dollars over three years through this currency exchange business across Australia.
*22:26.800- 22:32.180* :  Now this wasn't a small operation. This particular company was one of Australia's largest
*22:33.320- 22:40.200* :  independently owned remitters or money transfer companies. The investigation also had the help of
*22:40.200- 22:47.440* :  investigators from the US. So in the end four Chinese nationals and three Australian citizens
*22:47.440- 22:54.120* :  have been arrested. Many of them are due back in court next year to face what will be. You'd
*22:54.120- 23:01.260* :  imagine very serious allegations. Filmerser, he made his name as a bodybuilder, a movie star,
*23:01.260- 23:06.860* :  and then moved into politics as the Republican governor of California. Now the Austrian-American
*23:06.860- 23:11.660* :  Arnold Schwarzenegger is in Britain promoting his self-help book. In it he says,
*23:11.660- 23:17.680* :  rest is for babies and relaxation is for retired people. Justin Webb spoke to him about his book
*23:18.000- 23:24.140* :  and about next year's US presidential election. I've never dreamt of being a motivational speaker,
*23:24.760- 23:30.420* :  nor have I dreamt about riding motivational books or anything like that. I do have a lot of
*23:30.420- 23:36.980* :  really great ideas that I have figured out. Not that I have studied other books. I've never
*23:36.980- 23:42.200* :  read a self-help book period, right? When I read it, it's really striking, almost from the tight
*23:42.200- 23:48.300* :  long words. Arnold Schwarzenegger philosophy, yes it's about doing the things that make you the best
*23:48.300- 23:55.140* :  person you can be, but it's also a lot of it about mashing in with the world. Well, because I think
*23:55.580- 24:03.660* :  that in the end we have to recognize that we are not self-made people. I am a creation
*24:04.520- 24:11.720* :  often a lot of help. My parents, my coaches, my teachers, my mentors that motivated me and
*24:11.980- 24:18.740* :  who made me successful in my movies, it was the fans. You have a great love for America,
*24:18.740- 24:25.800* :  always have had. It's in a considerable mess at the moment, isn't it? Not just politically,
*24:25.800- 24:31.880* :  socially as well. How do you view what's happening at the moment in America? Well, I think
*24:32.880- 24:43.100* :  that I look at things much more in a global way. I see unrest and internal conflicts all over the
*24:43.500- 24:49.080* :  world. And people are fighting. And the same is in America. The extreme rights and the extreme
*24:49.080- 24:56.680* :  left are fighting. You know, we have elections and it's a choice between two guys that in the late
*24:56.680- 25:03.580* :  70s and early 80s. And you said, that's pitiful because where's the young crowd? Where are the
*25:03.580- 25:11.600* :  young thinkers and leaders? Do you think Joe Biden should step down? I'm not about to say that
*25:11.600- 25:18.420* :  because that's something that he has to decide and that his party has to decide. It's not so much
*25:18.420- 25:24.820* :  the age that bothers me. And when it comes to intelligence, it's just what bothers me is the
*25:24.820- 25:30.660* :  energy level. It needs energy to bring both of the parties together because when you have
*25:31.340- 25:37.660* :  Democrats and Republicans work together, big stuff can happen. Immigration reform, health
*25:38.140- 25:43.840* :  reform, wiping out the debt and the deficit that we have in the United States. And the only way
*25:43.840- 25:48.000* :  you can tackle it is if both of the parties work together. Can you see that happening again?
*25:48.000- 25:53.360* :  Of course it can happen. In that case, what would a Trump second term look like for America?
*25:53.360- 25:58.300* :  Would it be the kind of reaching across the aisle that you've just described or not?
*25:59.200- 26:06.080* :  Why would we talk about that when it is literally impossible? No, trust me. He would not be our
*26:06.080- 26:12.340* :  next president. I think that he will get maybe the nomination, but because the majority of people
*26:12.340- 26:18.620* :  are not interested in him. I think it's a waste of time to talk about at Trump presidency
*26:19.400- 26:24.880* :  because it's a fantasy. And I hate to talk about fantasies. I like to talk about reality. I mean,
*26:24.880- 26:30.900* :  Donald Trump has 30% 30% of the votes, which is the hard core right. And then you need
*26:30.900- 26:37.060* :  over 50% to win. And he's not going to have that. Right. You're convinced. If he is nominated,
*26:37.060- 26:42.000* :  there will not be another Trump presidency. Look, as I said to you, I'm not always right,
*26:42.000- 26:45.440* :  but I think I'm right on that one. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
*26:46.640- 26:50.160* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
