*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.380* :  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.100- 00:24.240* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Wednesday 25th of October.
*00:24.760- 00:29.020* :  Israel is criticized over its airstrikes on Gaza following the Hamas massacre.
*00:29.660- 00:34.360* :  It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.
*00:34.640- 00:39.880* :  The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.
*00:40.520- 00:44.560* :  But the Israeli foreign minister hits back angrily at the UN Chief.
*00:45.080- 00:48.780* :  Mr Secretary General, in what world do you live?
*00:50.160- 00:53.160* :  Definitely, this is not our world.
*00:53.780- 00:59.240* :  However, the US is now calling for a humanitarian pause, so will Israel agree.
*01:02.820- 01:10.140* :  Also in the podcast, 33 US states sue meta, and a judge in Canada approves billions of dollars in
*01:10.140- 01:15.060* :  compensation for indigenous families who suffer discrimination in the child welfare system.
*01:20.120- 01:25.100* :  Israel is coming under increased diplomatic pressure over its response to the Hamas massacre
*01:25.100- 01:31.740* :  of more than 1,400 people two and a half weeks ago. In a heated exchange at the UN Security Council,
*01:31.740- 01:37.860* :  Israel's ambassador demanded that the UN Chief Antonio Guterresh resign after he said the attacks
*01:37.860- 01:43.620* :  by Hamas didn't happen in a vacuum. From UN headquarters in New York, his Nettafik.
*01:44.220- 01:49.120* :  UN officials gave a sobering briefing on the plight of two million Palestinians in Gaza,
*01:49.120- 01:53.060* :  facing non-stop Israeli airstrikes in a humanitarian catastrophe,
*01:53.100- 01:59.360* :  and the more than 200 hostages held by Hamas. The first to speak was the organization's head,
*01:59.360- 02:04.180* :  the Secretary General Antonio Guterresh, who said he was deeply concerned about the clear
*02:04.180- 02:09.980* :  violations of international humanitarian law being witnessed in Gaza. He reiterated that
*02:09.980- 02:14.440* :  there was no excuse for the appalling violence by Hamas militants on October 7th,
*02:14.720- 02:19.380* :  but also that it did not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
*02:19.960- 02:24.420* :  And seeking to put the latest flare-up in violence and context, he said it was important to
*02:24.420- 02:30.500* :  recognize that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been
*02:30.500- 02:37.000* :  subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their lands steadily devoured by
*02:37.000- 02:42.760* :  settlements and plagued by violence, their economy stifled, their people displaced,
*02:42.860- 02:48.600* :  and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been
*02:48.600- 02:54.120* :  vanishing, but the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas,
*02:54.980- 03:00.060* :  and those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
*03:00.300- 03:06.440* :  His remarks infuriated the Israeli delegation. Israel's ambassador to the UN called on Mr. Guterresh
*03:06.440- 03:11.660* :  to resign, saying on a social media post that he had expressed an understanding for terrorism
*03:11.660- 03:17.480* :  and murder. And foreign minister Eli Cohen addressed the Secretary General directly in the council.
*03:18.160- 03:27.060* :  Jan, babies, children are held in Gaza. This is beyond imagination. A living nightmare. They have
*03:27.060- 03:35.420* :  not caused evil, but there are victims of evil. These kids witness all which cannot be described,
*03:35.420- 03:39.320* :  Mr. Secretary General, in what world do you live?
*03:39.760- 03:45.080* :  Foreign minister Riyadh al-Maliki of the observer state of Palestine, as it's called within the UN,
*03:45.080- 03:50.800* :  appealed to council members, saying only international law and peace were worthy of their
*03:50.800- 03:58.280* :  unconditional support. No, no, Talfiq in New York. Well, others at the UN also urged Israel to
*03:58.280- 04:04.060* :  temper its attacks on Gaza. The Jordanian foreign minister said killing thousands of Palestinian
*04:04.060- 04:10.740* :  civilians was not self-defense. While the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken called for humanitarian
*04:10.780- 04:15.900* :  pauses in Israel's airstrikes to allow civilians in Gaza to get out of harm's way,
*04:15.900- 04:21.780* :  though he also condemned Hamas for using civilians as human shields. So will all this affect
*04:21.780- 04:27.060* :  Israel's military plans. Shortly before recording this podcast, I spoke to the diplomatic and
*04:27.060- 04:32.460* :  defense analyst Jonathan Marcus. I think it's already affecting Israel's calculations. I mean,
*04:32.460- 04:37.280* :  remember that we thought that Israel might begin its ground operation a few days ago now,
*04:37.800- 04:45.280* :  but the visit of President Biden, his comments, his urging on the need to allow the some aid
*04:45.280- 04:51.280* :  into Gaza. That has, I think, effectively delayed the operation already. I think there are
*04:51.280- 04:56.400* :  divisions within the Israeli government itself. I think the defense minister and the military
*04:56.400- 05:01.740* :  commanders are probably far more eager to get going with the ground operation. I think Mr. Netanyahu
*05:01.740- 05:09.040* :  perhaps is a bit hesitant as well. And of course, this rising crescendo of criticism as the
*05:09.260- 05:16.240* :  Israeli air operations and some artillery attacks continue. That, of course, complicates the
*05:16.240- 05:21.340* :  matter even further. I mean, it's becoming a huge diplomatic mess. As you say, the Israeli
*05:21.340- 05:26.680* :  military has been ready to go in for some time. Does this delay degrade their readiness?
*05:26.680- 05:33.200* :  Not necessarily. I mean, clearly, it gives them a little extra time to hone their plans to be
*05:33.200- 05:40.000* :  prepared and so on. But of course, remember, this is a huge mobilization in Israel. Most of these
*05:40.000- 05:46.840* :  people have been taken away from their civilian jobs. That cannot go on forever. But of course,
*05:47.220- 05:52.560* :  none of the questions really that the Israelis have to answer have been answered. You know,
*05:52.560- 06:00.940* :  what really could they achieve in a ground operation in Gaza, beyond causing huge numbers of civilian
*06:00.940- 06:07.940* :  casualties and probably incurring significant military casualties themselves? Now, that isn't to say
*06:07.940- 06:14.280* :  that they aren't going to do something. That isn't to say that the Hamas massacres on the 7th
*06:14.280- 06:21.800* :  of October need some response. But it's a hugely complicated picture now. As the air campaign
*06:21.800- 06:27.380* :  goes on, the Palestinian suffering and the Palestinian death toll among civilians grows,
*06:28.140- 06:34.260* :  a kind of moment has passed. And I think the US Secretary of State's comment for a humanitarian
*06:34.260- 06:40.480* :  pause is another important straw in the wind. Jonathan Marcus defense and diplomatic analyst.
*06:40.960- 06:46.160* :  Well, in Gaza itself, eight lorries arrived from Egypt late in the day. The fourth emergency aid
*06:46.160- 06:52.560* :  convoy so far carrying water, food and medicine. President Biden has said aid isn't getting in
*06:52.560- 06:58.200* :  fast enough. While the main UN agency in the Gaza Strip has warned it will have to stop work on
*06:58.200- 07:03.060* :  Wednesday night. If it doesn't receive urgent deliveries of fuel, which Israel is blocking.
*07:03.060- 07:08.680* :  The World Health Organization, meanwhile, says the shortage of clean water is now critical.
*07:09.600- 07:14.600* :  Ahmad Abu Asi is with his family in Khan unis in the south of the Gaza Strip.
*07:15.160- 07:21.580* :  I managed to nip around here local shop to get some pasta. I couldn't find the breakfast morning.
*07:21.580- 07:27.400* :  I couldn't find any veg. I couldn't know electric, of course, nothing. Beable to go solo,
*07:27.400- 07:33.880* :  balance next door. They just managed to charge my phone. Beable has been each other here, but for how long?
*07:34.240- 07:40.440* :  I reckon the next two, three days. Beable to start killing each other for a bit of food here.
*07:40.660- 07:47.360* :  Ahmad Abu Asi. Well, Faisal Shawa has been forced to leave his home in Gaza with his wife and son.
*07:47.360- 07:53.220* :  He spoke to the BBC's Sarah Montague. I am now with my family and other friends in the middle area
*07:53.220- 07:59.120* :  as their instruction of the Israeli army. The situation is very difficult. We are lacking everything.
*07:59.120- 08:03.800* :  Food, medicine, of course, there is no electricity. We are lucky. We have solar energy.
*08:03.800- 08:10.020* :  It comes two, three hours a day. It's a miserable situation. We're just waiting for some good news
*08:10.020- 08:15.700* :  to end bombardment of the Israeli army everywhere. We have nothing lifting us. That's what we hear,
*08:15.780- 08:19.920* :  but I don't know exactly the situation, but I think you know better than us.
*08:20.320- 08:27.580* :  And each night you hear the air strikes nearby? Of course, it's everywhere. I think we need wisdom now.
*08:27.880- 08:32.240* :  Enough is enough. We need a ceasefire. We lost everything now.
*08:32.240- 08:37.960* :  And we need a real solution for the situation. Every year, every two years, we have some kind of
*08:37.960- 08:43.960* :  Israeli invasion to Gaza or war on Gaza. They destroy Gaza and then we rebuild Gaza.
*08:44.140- 08:48.180* :  Enough is enough. Everybody wants to live in peace and nobody wants to lose lives.
*08:48.640- 08:50.860* :  And Faisal, do you know many people who have been killed?
*08:51.540- 08:57.320* :  Of course, many, many people. Gaza is a small place and everyone knows everyone.
*08:57.320- 09:01.400* :  And believe me sometimes to be killed better than be injured. You die.
*09:01.400- 09:07.000* :  And hopefully you'll go to heaven. But the one who is injured, nobody can take care of him or her.
*09:07.000- 09:07.960* :  That's the misery.
*09:08.480- 09:12.640* :  What is the feeling about Hamas there? And what they did on the 7th?
*09:12.800- 09:18.800* :  It's not about the feelings. It did not start on the 7th. No one in Gaza wants to kill anybody.
*09:19.000- 09:22.300* :  We should be honest now. We don't want to make Hamas a big army.
*09:22.300- 09:26.460* :  And then Israel is allowed to use whatever weapons they want to experiment on us.
*09:26.680- 09:29.480* :  Because the Gaza strip is an experiment field for everybody.
*09:29.480- 09:32.120* :  For the American weapons, for the Israel weapons.
*09:32.520- 09:34.440* :  And who pays the price? We pay the price.
*09:34.720- 09:39.680* :  Do you think Hamas should release hostages to try to move the situation on?
*09:39.800- 09:45.800* :  There should be a solution. Of course, we want to end this. No civilians should be prisoner.
*09:46.400- 09:47.580* :  Neither here nor in Israel.
*09:48.100- 09:51.760* :  But believe me, it's not about today. It's not about October the 7th.
*09:51.880- 09:55.120* :  Let's be frank and be kind to each other.
*09:55.580- 10:00.200* :  Majority of Palestinians living in Gaza. We believe in peace.
*10:01.320- 10:04.420* :  Stop killing. In the killing, stop the killing.
*10:05.100- 10:09.220* :  For God's sake, how many Palestinians should be killed to be satisfied?
*10:09.220- 10:14.400* :  We have 5,000 today, 5,500. Is it 7,000? Is it a good number?
*10:15.120- 10:17.640* :  Faisal Shawa talking to Sarah Montague.
*10:18.780- 10:23.120* :  Some other stories now. And a judge in Canada has approved the nation's largest ever
*10:23.120- 10:27.980* :  agreement to compensate indigenous families for the discrimination they experienced at the hands
*10:27.980- 10:33.120* :  of the child welfare system. More than 300,000 children and their families
*10:33.120- 10:37.360* :  will share a settlement of nearly $17 billion. Here's Katwina.
*10:37.920- 10:43.580* :  In 2019, the Canadian human rights tribunal found that the services provided by the country's
*10:43.580- 10:47.640* :  welfare system to first nation's children, especially through the foster care system,
*10:47.640- 10:53.180* :  were chronically underfunded in discriminatory. Despite making up less than 10% of Canadian children,
*10:53.620- 10:56.720* :  indigenous children account for more than half of those in foster care.
*10:57.160- 11:01.440* :  A further $15 billion has been airmarked for reform of the welfare system itself.
*11:01.440- 11:06.080* :  The decision comes as Canada attempts to come to terms with historic injustices
*11:06.500- 11:10.820* :  against indigenous children. In recent years, hundreds of unmarked graves have been found
*11:10.820- 11:15.160* :  at residential schools where first nation's children were forcibly placed
*11:15.160- 11:20.920* :  up to as late as the 1990s. In a move, investigators have described as cultural genocide.
*11:21.480- 11:27.460* :  Katwina reporting. 33 states in the US have grouped together to file a lawsuit
*11:27.460- 11:32.300* :  accusing the Facebook and Instagram owner of contributing to a youth mental health crisis
*11:32.300- 11:38.200* :  for the sake of profit. A suit filed in a federal court in California said meta had repeatedly
*11:38.200- 11:44.240* :  misled the public about the substantial dangers of its services. Meta said it tried to make young
*11:44.240- 11:48.760* :  people safe online. On North America business correspondent Michelle Flurry told me more.
*11:49.180- 11:54.440* :  At the heart of it, meta is accused of hooking teenagers to its platforms,
*11:55.100- 12:00.420* :  creating products whether it's on Facebook or Instagram that kind of keeps young people
*12:00.420- 12:06.260* :  coming back again and again and again and spending longer and longer. It comes at a time when
*12:06.260- 12:11.320* :  America is facing this mental health crisis amongst young people and so it's a particularly
*12:11.320- 12:16.720* :  explosive issue here. In addition to that, the company has been accused of collecting data of
*12:16.720- 12:22.060* :  children under the age of 13 and that breaks its obligations under a law known as the Children's
*12:22.120- 12:27.540* :  Online Privacy Protection Act. So some serious allegations. A lot of the lawsuit actually was
*12:27.540- 12:32.520* :  blocked out so we weren't able to read all of it but I mean just to give you an example,
*12:32.560- 12:36.920* :  it's things like those nudges that you get that kind of alert you to new feeds,
*12:36.920- 12:41.460* :  things coming in that kind of keep you coming back that prod you, that's the sort of behavior
*12:42.040- 12:47.860* :  that these attorneys general say has basically contributed to the pain that children are going
*12:47.860- 12:52.360* :  through right now and they say it's time for Facebook and meta its parent company to be held
*12:52.360- 12:57.220* :  accountable. And what do the states want to happen as a result of this case? That's where
*12:57.220- 13:01.860* :  it gets a bit willier. When pressed on this, they sort of held a briefing and asked exactly that,
*13:01.860- 13:07.160* :  do you want kids barred from using these platforms altogether? What is it that you want? They said
*13:07.520- 13:13.100* :  it's the specific things that push kids to spend longer and keep coming back. That's what they want
*13:13.100- 13:17.840* :  rolled back. Again, try to get a more specific definition of that and that's where it kind of gets
*13:17.840- 13:23.140* :  into a gray area. Meta for Rootsparts said they were disappointed by the lawsuit today. They said,
*13:23.140- 13:28.940* :  look, we've rolled out about 30 tools that can help kids and families navigate this whether it's
*13:28.940- 13:34.460* :  sort of parental controls or such, but clearly lawmakers not satisfied at the moment.
*13:34.460- 13:40.860* :  But a reflection of the growing legal and regulatory difficulties facing these kind of tech companies.
*13:41.140- 13:44.940* :  Well, and this is where it gets interesting. I mean, at the moment Google, the other big tech
*13:44.940- 13:51.140* :  giant is facing a case right now about its dominant market position. I think it feeds into a broader
*13:51.140- 13:56.300* :  debate about how whether it's congressional leaders or whether it's lawmakers, they are trying to
*13:56.300- 14:01.980* :  reign in big tech, but their track record hasn't been that good. And it was interesting hearing from
*14:01.980- 14:06.100* :  one of the attorneys general from Colorado who acknowledged that the task ahead in this particular
*14:06.100- 14:10.340* :  case was formidable, but they felt it was important. And that's why they're moving ahead.
*14:10.700- 14:13.180* :  On North America, business correspondent Michelle Flarey.
*14:15.840- 14:17.900* :  And still to come on the global news podcast.
*14:18.580- 14:24.180* :  In 20 years, obesity has increased by 20% and the most popular restaurants are fast food.
*14:24.180- 14:28.140* :  That's why you have to win this battle. And the Minister, of course, has the support of all
*14:28.140- 14:33.540* :  proper disorders. Why, French restaurants are being encouraged to make their own food.
*14:42.060- 14:47.080* :  A powerful storm has started making landfall in southern Bangladesh. It's like
*14:47.080- 14:51.120* :  lone hamoon is crossing near the Chateau Graham Coastal region, bringing wind speeds
*14:51.120- 14:56.120* :  to more than 50 kilometers an hour. Our South Asia regional editor, and Brassan Etter-Rajan,
*14:56.120- 15:01.360* :  has the details. The main body of hamoon is expected to hit southern Bangladesh in the next
*15:01.360- 15:07.800* :  a few hours. Whether officials say the wind speed could go up to 90 kilometers an hour if the storm
*15:07.800- 15:12.920* :  gains momentum. The region is already being lashed by heavy rain and gusty winds.
*15:13.360- 15:17.220* :  Several trees have been uprooted and low-lying areas inundated.
*15:17.680- 15:22.740* :  Officials say tides may be more than a meter higher than normal and there are warnings of
*15:22.740- 15:28.400* :  flash flooding. Volunteers and rescue workers have already moved more than a million people to
*15:28.400- 15:34.720* :  safety in 10 districts. There are no reports of casualties so far. Operations at Bangladesh's
*15:34.720- 15:39.820* :  biggest port in Chateau Graham have been suspended with both transport and fishing halted.
*15:40.260- 15:45.500* :  Bangladesh used to witness heavy casualties during cyclones, but in the past 10 years,
*15:45.500- 15:51.020* :  better forecasting and more effective emergency evacuation have reduced the number of those
*15:51.020- 15:57.700* :  killed in such disasters. And Brassan Etter-Rajan. A German rescue team in the North Sea has been
*15:57.700- 16:03.680* :  trying to locate four semen who may be trapped inside a British cargo ship, which sank on Tuesday.
*16:04.280- 16:09.080* :  The variety went down in waters around 30 meters deep after colliding with a larger freighter,
*16:09.320- 16:13.600* :  called the Palsy. One of the seven people on the variety was found dead in the water.
*16:14.060- 16:16.880* :  Another two had been rescued, but four were still missing.
*16:16.880- 16:21.040* :  Christiane Stieperl-D is from the German Sea Rescue Society.
*16:24.520- 16:29.740* :  There is always hope for rescuers. We will not stop our search and rescue operation
*16:29.740- 16:35.980* :  as long as there is a small chance of finding survivors. No one can say when that will be.
*16:36.420- 16:40.880* :  No one knows how these sea fares were equipped when they went to sea.
*16:41.280- 16:43.960* :  Well, our correspondent, Harold Griffith, is following the story.
*16:44.480- 16:50.520* :  So we know that the variety was carrying a consignment of steel, leaving Bremen last night at 9pm
*16:50.520- 16:58.000* :  local time, and it made its way up to the North Sea coast of Germany. Then at about 5am local time,
*16:58.000- 17:03.800* :  it's path across this far bigger cargo ship, the Palsy, which was heading from Germany to Spain.
*17:03.800- 17:08.260* :  And at that time, we understand the collision, left the Palsy crew,
*17:08.260- 17:13.960* :  an injured 22 people on that ship, but the variety started to sink with its seven crew members.
*17:14.480- 17:19.320* :  Two of the crew members were found alive, and sadly one was found dead in the water.
*17:19.320- 17:23.780* :  But the whereabouts of the other four at the moment is still unknown.
*17:23.780- 17:27.760* :  Initially, a big sea and air operation was launched with the German Navy,
*17:27.760- 17:32.520* :  sending a seaking into the air, closing the airspace so they could scour the tops of the waves.
*17:32.800- 17:37.620* :  Then later in the day, we were told about this diving mission down to the sea bed,
*17:37.620- 17:41.580* :  with the belief that potentially the four crew members could still be in there
*17:41.960- 17:47.180* :  in some kind of air lock, or if there was any sort of provision for oxygen for them to remain alive
*17:47.180- 17:50.020* :  underwater. That at the moment seems to be the best hope.
*17:50.240- 17:54.900* :  So that operation is underway. It was launched a few hours ago by the German authorities,
*17:55.420- 17:59.320* :  and they've not put a time limit on it. Clearly, with divers, it's time limited,
*17:59.320- 18:03.800* :  they only have their own oxygen supply to go up and down to continue to search the vessel,
*18:04.320- 18:09.100* :  but they're clearly throwing everything out this, both in the air on the surface of the water,
*18:09.540- 18:13.320* :  and with the divers on the seabed. And have they actually located the vessel?
*18:13.580- 18:17.740* :  Yes, we understand that they know where the vessel is, and if you look at marine tracking data,
*18:18.120- 18:21.980* :  you're able to see pretty closely where the ship went down.
*18:22.600- 18:27.460* :  Six German rescue vessels were sent to. It even appeared no cruise liner that happened to be in
*18:27.460- 18:32.600* :  the area joined in with the rescue effort. We were told some doctors on board who could potentially
*18:32.600- 18:38.000* :  help any survivors, but we understand actually the two survivors they found could be taken
*18:38.060- 18:41.700* :  onto Germany to seek medical assistance there. How are Griffith?
*18:42.420- 18:47.100* :  It is said to be the world's only museum devoted to censored art, and it's just open in the
*18:47.100- 18:52.080* :  Spanish city of Barcelona. The gallery features artworks that have been denounced, attacked,
*18:52.080- 18:57.560* :  or removed from exhibition. They come from a collection of 200 pieces, built up by the Spanish
*18:57.560- 19:01.680* :  journalist and businessman, Tacho Bennett. He spoke to Julian Marshall.
*19:02.520- 19:07.280* :  We have worked from Picasso, from Klimt, Goja, My Way Way, from Ande Warhol,
*19:07.740- 19:12.080* :  Banksy from many different artists all over the world. The only characteristic of all of them
*19:12.080- 19:19.400* :  is that all of them in one way or the other has suffered censored prohibition or some kind of
*19:19.400- 19:26.220* :  violence, or the artist has been banned in some way, this kind of thing. Do you have any particular
*19:26.220- 19:32.280* :  favourites yourself? I think that the one that I have more care for, for it is one from
*19:32.280- 19:37.920* :  Celica Boudella, not it's from Algeria and France, because after buying this piece,
*19:37.920- 19:42.980* :  I really decided I was going to be a collector of censored art. The name is silence,
*19:43.020- 19:49.760* :  rouge, et bleu, but it was censored in Clichin, France, because the piece is formed by 30,
*19:49.760- 19:53.660* :  sorry, I don't remember the name in English, you know, these small pieces of the Muslims
*19:53.660- 20:00.440* :  do their prayers, and on top of each of them, there is an estilator, nice woman shoe,
*20:00.840- 20:07.960* :  so it gives you a vision of the way that the Muslim world is treating women. And it was censored
*20:07.960- 20:14.880* :  in Clichin, France, because it was close to the Charlie Hebdo killings, and the Mayor of the
*20:14.880- 20:21.140* :  city just decided that it was not due to show that piece. So this is a collection of prayer mats
*20:21.140- 20:28.240* :  with women's shoes on top of them. Yes, exactly. And you've got a collection of drawings by former
*20:28.240- 20:35.200* :  prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Yes, we have also the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay, they were allowed
*20:35.200- 20:42.480* :  to do drawers or paintings and an art gallery in New York. Just show them, and that created a great
*20:42.480- 20:49.680* :  scandal, because the association of victims of 9-11 protest about it, then the US government
*20:49.680- 20:56.320* :  decided that their prisoners of Guantanamo Bay, they were allowed to paint or to draw, but once
*20:56.320- 21:02.660* :  they were freed, they had to leave their work there to be destroyed. You got works from Andy Warhol
*21:02.960- 21:08.360* :  and Pamela Picasso. They weren't censored, whether they were what vandalized in some way.
*21:08.860- 21:13.620* :  Specifically, the word that I have from Andy Warhol, for instance, is Mausetun, and it was
*21:13.620- 21:21.680* :  banned in China. And Picasso is interesting. Those are pieces that Picasso create showing the painter
*21:21.680- 21:29.560* :  Raphael and his mistress making love and the Pope looking at them through a hole. So I need to
*21:29.560- 21:37.460* :  ask Pam for many years in many places of the world. Are there any artworks that offend you particularly,
*21:37.460- 21:44.300* :  that you would not exhibit? No, I think that the limits of freedom of expression have to be
*21:44.300- 21:49.620* :  determined by the artist, and the other can express limits is the viewer that we were can decide,
*21:49.620- 21:55.060* :  I don't want to see that sort. I'm going to look to another place. Me as a promoter, I don't have
*21:55.060- 22:02.180* :  any limit at all. As far as there is a piece of art that has been censored, I will try to show them
*22:02.180- 22:07.540* :  in my collection. That's your Bennett, talking to Julian Marshall. France is famous for its
*22:07.540- 22:12.900* :  oat cuisine, but amid concerns about declining gastronomic standards, the French government has
*22:12.900- 22:19.360* :  announced new rules obliging restaurateurs to indicate on menus which dishes are not homemade.
*22:19.420- 22:23.760* :  The Minister for Small Businesses said it would give a helping hand to those restaurants that
*22:23.760- 22:28.400* :  do actually cook all their own food. But as you Scoville reports from Paris such,
*22:28.880- 22:31.800* :  establishments are now in a distinct minority in France.
*22:34.800- 22:38.680* :  It might come as some surprise. It's definitely not something the food business like
*22:38.680- 22:43.780* :  Sbouche to talk about, but the fact is that at your average affordable French bistro or
*22:43.780- 22:49.920* :  brasserie, what you're eating has almost certainly not been cooked on the premises. Far more
*22:49.920- 22:55.920* :  likely, especially if the menu's a long one. Your dish has been bought, ready prepared and frozen,
*22:56.240- 23:02.220* :  or it's been delivered that day from a big out-of-town mega-kitchen, where Blancet de Vaux,
*23:02.220- 23:08.220* :  or whatever, are mass-produced and then put in vans. There's no disgrace, it's pure economics,
*23:08.220- 23:13.800* :  most restaurants would go under if they'd to hire all the extra staff needed to go who made.
*23:14.480- 23:19.240* :  But it is a little unfair on those establishments that do actually make the effort.
*23:20.040- 23:25.580* :  So genuine bonafide restructures are delighted by this new initiative, which means that dishes
*23:25.580- 23:31.700* :  produced by their competitors, which aren't famous all, will have to be signaled as such.
*23:31.700- 23:35.120* :  Alaphon, then, runs Le Misturé in Central Paris.
*23:35.460- 23:41.240* :  Au Ventant, in 20 years, obesity has increased by 20% in France, and the most popular restaurants
*23:41.240- 23:46.580* :  are fast food. Our grandmothers and mothers taught us how to eat well, so how did we end up like
*23:46.580- 23:50.960* :  this? That's why we have to win this battle, and the Minister, of course, has the support of
*23:50.960- 23:57.200* :  all proper risottes. Behind it all is that ever-present French fear of losing status, of being
*23:57.200- 24:03.600* :  déclassé, saying goodbye to what once made the country great. One international food website
*24:03.600- 24:10.180* :  last year ranked French astronomy in ninth position behind Turkey and the United States.
*24:10.600- 24:15.640* :  That is a humiliation which French chefs find hard indeed to swallow.
*24:16.340- 24:17.740* :  You Scofield, in Paris.
*24:20.080- 24:24.520* :  And that's all from us for now, but there we a new addition of the global news podcast very soon.
*24:24.520- 24:29.400* :  This one was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Emma Joseph. Our editor is Karen Martin.
*24:29.840- 24:31.800* :  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
