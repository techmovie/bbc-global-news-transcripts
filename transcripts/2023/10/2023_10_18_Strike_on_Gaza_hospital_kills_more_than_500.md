*00:00.060- 00:04.260* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.600- 00:11.020* :  I'm Charlotte Gallagher, and in the early hours of Wednesday, the 18th of October,
*00:11.320- 00:12.700* :  these are our main stories.
*00:19.740- 00:24.580* :  An explosion at a hospital in Gaza has killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians.
*00:25.320- 00:27.920* :  Many were in the building, sheltering from the violence.
*00:27.920- 00:33.740* :  Hamas says it was hit by an Israeli air strike, but Israel denies it was responsible.
*00:34.120- 00:36.880* :  Let me be clear, the IDF does not target hospitals.
*00:37.380- 00:39.680* :  That's a sensitive side. It's a humanitarian side.
*00:39.680- 00:45.780* :  President Biden is travelling to the region for talks, but what chance has diplomacy at this point
*00:45.800- 00:47.800* :  will get the latest from Jerusalem.
*00:51.140- 00:56.260* :  Also in this podcast, one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters in the Republican Party
*00:56.740- 00:59.760* :  fails in his first bid to become Speaker of the House,
*01:00.260- 01:03.920* :  and the Oscar-winning bond girl who has a new sporting challenge.
*01:04.380- 01:09.260* :  I never dreamt of being an actress, but as a child, I always dreamt of being an Olympian,
*01:10.200- 01:13.140* :  because sports was very much part of my life going up.
*01:16.700- 01:22.880* :  But first, the US President Joe Biden is flying to Israel as the conflict in Gaza escalates
*01:22.880- 01:28.480* :  to an unprecedented level, with a devastating missile attack on the Al Ali Arab Baptist
*01:28.480- 01:34.540* :  Hospital in Gaza City. Palestinian health officials say at least 500 people have been killed.
*01:41.440- 01:47.460* :  Video show chaotic scenes, bloodied and wounded people being rushed away on stretchers and
*01:47.460- 01:53.520* :  ambulances. Dr. Gasson Abu Sitter is a British surgeon who was in the hospital when the explosion
*01:53.520- 01:56.480* :  happened and spoke to the BBC shortly afterwards.
*02:15.660- 02:19.380* :  House officials say the hospital was hit by an Israeli air strike,
*02:19.820- 02:24.380* :  and it's prompted the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, to pull out of Wednesday's summit
*02:24.380- 02:28.880* :  with President Biden. But the Israeli military has denied responsibility.
*02:28.880- 02:33.220* :  The spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces, Mark Regev, had this to say.
*02:33.600- 02:38.540* :  Let me be clear, the IDF does not target hospitals. That's a sensitive side, it's a humanitarian
*02:38.540- 02:46.620* :  side. From past conflicts with the terrorists in Gaza, we know that on average about 33% of the
*02:46.620- 02:53.600* :  rockets that they shoot at us fall short and land in Gaza. That's a fact. I urge you to be cautious,
*02:54.100- 02:58.140* :  there are indications, very, very serious indications that it's not us.
*02:58.720- 03:03.440* :  Just before recording this edition of the Global News podcast, our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*03:03.440- 03:07.700* :  Tom Bateman, described the scenes at the hospital to James Coomre-Sami.
*03:08.180- 03:14.900* :  Absolute devastation and scenes of carnage that have resulted from the explosion and what we have
*03:14.940- 03:20.880* :  seen is almost indescribable and I think the pictures would be too graphic, to broadcast, for
*03:20.880- 03:27.560* :  example, that they show maimed individuals and casualties being rushed out on stretches.
*03:27.560- 03:33.300* :  And the street outside, this particular area, the courtyard of the hospital, where it seems
*03:33.300- 03:40.220* :  around a thousand people, displaced people were sheltering, having taken shelter from these
*03:40.220- 03:44.580* :  almost relentless Israeli air strikes in the bombardment over the last week or so.
*03:44.900- 03:48.820* :  There were a thousand people there. Actually, that was far fewer than had been a few days ago,
*03:48.820- 03:53.060* :  because the hospital itself has said they said there was an Israeli air strike on Saturday,
*03:53.060- 03:58.060* :  which injured a few people. At that point, they said they had 6,000 people sheltering in the courtyard.
*03:58.060- 04:03.900* :  This is an Anglican run hospital. And the numbers then were down to around a thousand.
*04:04.080- 04:10.200* :  The whole scene is gray and blackened and charred, burned out vehicles and bodies and the wounded
*04:10.200- 04:14.100* :  lying in the streets. And what many of the medical staff there and others are saying is that they're
*04:14.100- 04:18.820* :  still trying to pull people out from the rubble after the explosion. But as you say, in terms
*04:18.820- 04:24.040* :  of what caused it, we have claim and counterclaim. Civil defense in Gaza City said this was an
*04:24.040- 04:29.720* :  Israeli air strike. A witness speaking to the BBC said as far as he was concerned, it was an
*04:29.720- 04:34.360* :  Israeli air strike. The Israelis are saying their early indications are this was a Palestinian
*04:34.360- 04:38.700* :  rocket that fell short. And there's been an immediate reaction on the street of the West Bank.
*04:39.420- 04:44.240* :  There has been hundreds of people out in the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
*04:44.240- 04:50.300* :  They are coming out demanding that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas steps down.
*04:50.720- 04:54.860* :  And this is in an environment where we've seen the Palestinian Authority which is the
*04:55.420- 04:59.880* :  internationally backed organization that has limited governance in parts of the West Bank.
*05:00.480- 05:05.740* :  Many Palestinians see it as effectively unable to represent their interests, unable to prevent
*05:05.740- 05:10.000* :  the effects of Israel's military occupation in the West Bank. They're very tired of the PA.
*05:10.000- 05:14.760* :  It's extremely unpopular and this seems to have been a trigger to many Palestinians coming out
*05:14.760- 05:20.000* :  demanding that Mahmoud Abbas stands down. On the eve of the U.S. President's visit,
*05:20.420- 05:24.000* :  we see now the region slipping even further into crisis.
*05:24.740- 05:31.260* :  That was Tom Bateman. The BBC's Rusty Abu Alouf is now in Khan units in southern Gaza,
*05:31.260- 05:37.260* :  having left his home in Gaza City along with hundreds and thousands of others told to do so by
*05:37.260- 05:40.900* :  the Israelis. This was his reaction to the attack on the hospital.
*05:41.380- 05:47.440* :  It's in the middle of the night and most people are in door and it's very hard to find a witness
*05:47.440- 05:54.680* :  that saw this. My sister, she literally lived 50 to 60 meters from the border of this hospital.
*05:55.220- 06:01.320* :  Very difficult communication. I managed to talk to my nephew. I asked him what happened. He said,
*06:01.320- 06:06.960* :  we don't know. We just heard two explosions and we thought they are just hitting something and
*06:06.960- 06:12.180* :  suddenly he said, we started to see hundreds of ambulances and people are shouting, running
*06:12.180- 06:17.880* :  in the streets. So we rushed to the scene and he said, we were shocked to see hundreds of bodies
*06:18.320- 06:25.100* :  on the ground, blood everywhere, people shouting, big chaos. So people started to transfer the
*06:25.100- 06:31.060* :  serious injuries in their cars. We have to understand that even the life-saving kids
*06:31.480- 06:36.420* :  are running out in the hospital. They were appealing even before this massive casualties are
*06:36.420- 06:42.120* :  happening to the hospital. So the hospital was already overwhelmed by hundreds. We are
*06:42.120- 06:47.680* :  talking about 10,000 people injured since the October 7th and most of them they rushed to
*06:47.680- 06:53.380* :  the hospital. Imagine this hospital which overwhelmed which is struggling to cope with the situation
*06:53.380- 06:59.600* :  with a very little fuel they have and suddenly they receive 500 people either killed or seriously
*06:59.820- 07:07.100* :  so the situation is chaotic. That was rushed to Abu Al-Uluf in Gaza. Let's look now at the
*07:07.100- 07:12.160* :  international reaction to this attack which comes just a day before President Biden is due to
*07:12.160- 07:17.640* :  arriving the region on a crucial visit. He had been expected to meet the Israeli prime minister
*07:18.140- 07:22.860* :  and then travel to Jordan to meet other regional leaders, but King Abdullah of Jordan,
*07:22.860- 07:26.840* :  he was due to host the summit, blamed Israel for the strike on the hospital,
*07:26.840- 07:32.860* :  describing it as a massacre and a war crime. Jordan has said that summit is now cancelled.
*07:32.860- 07:38.680* :  Egypt too said it condemned the airstrike in the strongest possible terms. I've been speaking
*07:38.680- 07:44.520* :  to our diplomatic correspondent James Landel. What has been fascinating has been the way many
*07:44.520- 07:49.560* :  countries, particularly Arab countries, have responded very very quickly to the devastation of
*07:49.560- 07:56.120* :  the hospital, blaming Israel. Countries like Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE. In other
*07:56.120- 08:01.840* :  words countries that have links, some of them have links to Israel, some of them have normalized
*08:01.840- 08:08.660* :  relations, some of these countries and yet they have all blamed Israel and they have called it a
*08:08.660- 08:15.560* :  heinous crime, they've called it a massacre and those kinds of things. All the while there is
*08:15.580- 08:19.940* :  claim and claim and counter claim over who is responsible for this attack and so I think
*08:21.160- 08:29.400* :  even before we know the full facts, what is clear is that these Arab governments feel very very
*08:29.400- 08:35.340* :  constrained. They have seen the speed with which people in many Arab countries have taken to the
*08:35.340- 08:40.120* :  streets and these Arab governments have realized that their room for maneuver is now constrained
*08:40.340- 08:44.740* :  and they simply had no alternative but to go out to condemn Israel and that's what we've seen
*08:44.740- 08:50.300* :  happen, despite the fact that there are now competing claims over who is responsible and how.
*08:50.600- 08:55.220* :  And all this has happened when President Biden is preparing to go to the Middle East,
*08:55.220- 08:59.580* :  the Palestinian President has already said I'm not going to meet you now. I mean how much can
*08:59.580- 09:05.880* :  he realistically achieve then? I think it has become hugely complicated for the U.S. President.
*09:05.940- 09:12.440* :  It was hard before, it's got even harder now because the whole idea was that President Biden
*09:12.440- 09:18.460* :  would come to Israel in particular, lavish support for Israel but at the same time say that you've
*09:18.460- 09:23.600* :  got to act and get more humanitarian aid into Gaza and you've got to create some safe spaces where
*09:23.600- 09:29.320* :  to quote Anthony Blinken in the U.S. State, civilians are out of harm's way and then that would
*09:29.320- 09:34.500* :  be enough for the Arab nations to buy into some kind of a deal. So they could say to their
*09:34.500- 09:38.900* :  populations, look we've got some humanitarian aid in, we've got a corridor, we've got some safe
*09:38.900- 09:44.020* :  areas, right? That was supposed to be something of the deal. That's now completely blown out of the
*09:44.020- 09:50.400* :  water. So there's no trust at the moment, there's different beliefs of what actually happened and
*09:50.400- 09:57.280* :  who is responsible. And so the prospect of there being some kind of progress I think is, well it's
*09:57.280- 10:03.600* :  a lot, lot harder than it was before. If it is proved that Israel did carry out this airstrike,
*10:03.600- 10:08.560* :  obviously they say it wasn't them. Could you see Western countries taking a much harder line with
*10:08.560- 10:13.900* :  Israel when so far they've been incredibly supportive? Yeah I think that whoever it is proven
*10:13.900- 10:19.540* :  responsible will be widely condemned and would have to be condemned because attacking a hospital
*10:19.540- 10:26.000* :  is a war crime if it is proved to be deliberate. If however it's a mistake then you get into a
*10:26.000- 10:32.900* :  slightly different scenario but the people who were responsible would still be condemned because
*10:32.900- 10:37.920* :  there's no way you can do anything but condemn. I don't think any government could possibly not condemn.
*10:38.580- 10:41.600* :  Something like this, you know, whoever is responsible for it.
*10:42.120- 10:48.060* :  That was James Landale. Israel was already facing mounting regional criticism of its ongoing
*10:48.060- 10:54.020* :  bombardment of Gaza before the airstrike on the hospital. Another bone of contention is the
*10:54.020- 10:58.920* :  delay in the opening of the Raffa crossing to allow desperately needed humanitarian aid
*10:58.920- 11:05.000* :  like food and water which the people of Gaza have been deprived of since Israel declared a siege.
*11:05.600- 11:10.780* :  Samay Shukri is Egypt's foreign minister in an interview with the BBC before the hospital
*11:10.780- 11:16.440* :  airstrike. Nulam Agavan asked him why Egypt had not opened the Raffa crossing with Gaza.
*11:17.000- 11:23.340* :  These attempts to misrepresent Egypt's position and the constant bombardment by the media
*11:23.340- 11:29.780* :  among the BBC to highlight that Egypt is not opening. It's totally incorrect and inaccurate
*11:29.780- 11:34.820* :  and improper. Egypt has said, and I have said personally, as far as we're concerned,
*11:34.820- 11:40.260* :  Raffa crossing on our side is officially open. Raffa crossing has been subjected to
*11:40.260- 11:47.540* :  four aerial bombardments that have made the crossing inaccessible in addition to the fact that
*11:47.560- 11:55.420* :  there is no authorization for the safe passage of the multitude of lorries that are a mess between
*11:55.420- 12:02.020* :  Arish and the border crossing in Raffa waiting to enter under safe conditions. I am in constant
*12:02.020- 12:08.960* :  contact with the United Nations envoy to extract a safe passage for those humanitarian assistance
*12:08.960- 12:14.640* :  that are much needed. Why the crossing is being bombarded and by whom it's being bombarded and
*12:14.640- 12:20.400* :  what is the objective of it's being bombarded? I presume it's not being bombarded so that it remains
*12:20.460- 12:26.580* :  open. If people, however, want to make that crossing and there were people, as you will know,
*12:26.580- 12:33.320* :  massing at that border, you believe that Egypt would let them through? The crossing once safe
*12:33.360- 12:39.640* :  for transit will continue to operate at the same level that it has always operated at. We will
*12:39.640- 12:46.720* :  receive those people who need medical assistance, who are in need of the special attention. This is
*12:46.720- 12:53.180* :  the normal status of that crossing. All those who are currently assembled by virtue of
*12:53.180- 12:59.900* :  the instructions of Israel to displace them, which is a contradiction to the international
*12:59.900- 13:05.220* :  humanitarian law from the north to the south, and are now facing these dire circumstances without
*13:05.220- 13:11.060* :  water, electricity, food and dwellings are in a very precarious situation and we have been
*13:11.060- 13:16.760* :  imploring the entrance of tents and foods and water so that we can provide the safe haven
*13:16.760- 13:22.380* :  inside of Gaza that they deserve. It is not a matter of transferring the responsibility to Egypt.
*13:22.380- 13:28.480* :  It is a matter of maintaining the safety and the well-being of Gazans on their own territory.
*13:28.480- 13:34.460* :  They are civilians. This is the responsibility of Israel as the occupying power. It must provide
*13:34.460- 13:39.540* :  for the safety of civilians. The concentration is what Egypt would do to receive them, rather
*13:39.540- 13:45.820* :  how we can provide the assistance and the humanitarian needs that they should receive. That should
*13:45.820- 13:52.500* :  be the question. What Israel would say is that they do not want to allow aid in until hostages
*13:52.500- 13:57.480* :  are released. Is that the responsibility of the civilian people of Gaza that they should suffer
*13:57.480- 14:03.560* :  until such time that the hostages held by an organization? What a lot of
*14:03.560- 14:08.080* :  whole population of Gaza should suffer. That is something that's not acceptable at all, that the
*14:08.080- 14:13.200* :  people of Gaza should be penalized because the hostages have not been released. They have nothing
*14:13.200- 14:19.100* :  to do with it. That was Samay Shukri speaking to Noona Magavan. And here's Jackie with some news
*14:19.100- 14:24.260* :  about another special edition of the Global News Podcast. You might have heard the special edition
*14:24.260- 14:29.700* :  we recorded answering listeners questions on events in Israel and Gaza and international reaction
*14:29.740- 14:35.160* :  to them. A lot of you have since been in touch to ask us to do it again, so we will.
*14:35.760- 14:40.780* :  Sent us your questions, anything you want explained and our correspondence will endeavour to provide
*14:40.780- 14:46.700* :  context and clarity. Please record us a voice message or simply write your question and email
*14:46.700- 14:52.680* :  it to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. Thank you.
*14:55.320- 15:00.360* :  Let's go to Washington now because the U.S. House of Representatives have failed in their attempt
*15:00.360- 15:06.440* :  to end a political deadlock and elect a new speaker. The previous one, Kevin McCarthy, was
*15:06.440- 15:11.820* :  ousted by a small group of fellow Republicans from the hard right of the party. They were hoping
*15:11.820- 15:17.640* :  to elect Jim Jordan, a close ally of Donald Trump. The Democrat politician, Jamie Raskin,
*15:17.640- 15:23.540* :  said the Republicans were in turmoil. There's a civil war taking place within the Republican
*15:23.540- 15:28.720* :  Party in Caucasus and that civil war might just turn into a purge of any moderates. It's starting
*15:28.720- 15:35.800* :  to look like there is a consolidation of the party around Trump and around the mega-win.
*15:35.860- 15:39.740* :  So I think the GOP right now might be the POT, the party of Trump.
*15:40.300- 15:44.520* :  Our Washington correspondent, Gary O'Donney, was there to watch events unfold.
*15:45.140- 15:49.200* :  It's a bit of a shambles, to be honest. What we've just had is a vote in the House and Jim
*15:49.200- 15:56.900* :  Jordan, who's the Republican nominee, was 17 votes short of getting majorities. 20 of his own party
*15:56.900- 16:02.620* :  voted against him, voted for other people and now they put the House into recess so they can
*16:02.620- 16:07.240* :  start doing a bit of arm twisting. If you're Jim Jordan, you might look on the bright side because
*16:07.880- 16:13.740* :  a week ago when he was seeking the nomination and other Republicans were also seeking, he only
*16:13.740- 16:20.360* :  got 99 votes. In some ways he's done a lot better but 20 votes from his own party is a big slap
*16:20.360- 16:27.360* :  in the face and some of those are very dead set against him becoming speaker. He can only afford
*16:27.360- 16:32.840* :  to lose three Republicans. That's the bottom line of the maths here and so there's an awful lot
*16:32.840- 16:39.260* :  of work for him to do. In the meantime, none of this business of the House can get underway.
*16:39.260- 16:46.200* :  This security funding for Israel, security funding for Ukraine, we've got a looming shutdown coming
*16:46.200- 16:53.140* :  up because government spending hasn't been agreed beyond November 17th. None of this can be sorted
*16:53.140- 16:58.860* :  until they sort of speak. How would you describe Jim Jordan because he's a polarising figure,
*16:58.860- 17:03.820* :  isn't he? He's on the far right of the Republican party. There's no question about that. He was
*17:04.280- 17:11.980* :  once described by a former Republican speaker as a legislative terrorist which in this context means
*17:11.980- 17:17.060* :  he tears things down according to that Republican he never builds it. He hasn't really passed any
*17:17.860- 17:21.960* :  legislation. He's very much on that, what you might call the mega wing of the party.
*17:21.960- 17:28.520* :  He, for example, refuses to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. He was one of the
*17:28.520- 17:34.600* :  key congressmen in touch with Donald Trump during that period after the election and Donald Trump has
*17:34.600- 17:42.540* :  been a strong backer of his for speaker. So he's very much in that part of the right of the party,
*17:43.160- 17:48.460* :  the ultra-conservatives however he wants to describe them and of course that means it's very polarising.
*17:49.340- 17:55.080* :  That was Gary O'Donohy. Next to the war in Ukraine and President Zelensky has confirmed
*17:55.080- 18:00.320* :  his country has started using a type of long-range missile supplied by the US.
*18:00.840- 18:05.340* :  There had been speculation the weapons were used in overnight raids which struck Russian
*18:05.340- 18:11.240* :  air bases in the south and east. From Kiev, James Waterhouse reports. Ukrainian Special Forces
*18:11.240- 18:16.580* :  say nine helicopters and an ammunition depot were destroyed and dozens of Russian soldiers were
*18:16.580- 18:21.980* :  killed in the strikes on Badansk and Lahansk. Pro-Russian social media accounts suggest
*18:21.980- 18:27.060* :  the damage caused by this attack was significant. Ukraine has effectively used Western missiles
*18:27.060- 18:32.820* :  before. There will be a relief in Kiev that these latest models have come from the US, given
*18:32.820- 18:38.240* :  now it is also focusing on the conflict in the Middle East. Our agreements with President Biden
*18:38.240- 18:43.920* :  are being implemented to President Zelensky in his evening address. They are executed very
*18:43.920- 18:50.920* :  accurately. He added, attackums have proven themselves. Now to a scientific discovery that could
*18:50.920- 18:56.420* :  be good news for cancer treatment. At present, certain drugs used to keep the disease under control
*18:56.420- 19:02.140* :  can stop working because the patient's body has adapted. But a study here in Britain suggests
*19:02.140- 19:08.520* :  a new way of reversing or even preventing that drug resistance is possible. Professor Johann
*19:08.520- 19:14.260* :  Dubono, who led the study, explained to Michelle Hussain how they stopped cancers using a type of
*19:14.260- 19:19.860* :  blood cells to grow. These white blood cells are hijacked into the tumor to feed the tumor with
*19:19.860- 19:25.820* :  growth factors. So we have run a trial, this is really more than 10 years of work, showing that we
*19:25.820- 19:31.160* :  can block these white blood cells feeding the cancer by preventing them getting into the cancer
*19:31.160- 19:37.720* :  with a tablet taking every day that has minimal side effects and then can reverse resistance to
*19:37.720- 19:42.220* :  the established anti-cancer therapies. And these were men with prostate cancer, as he said,
*19:42.220- 19:47.040* :  who really had no therapy options left. So we saw tumor shrinkage. This can be in prostate
*19:47.040- 19:53.140* :  cancer scene on the scans in a blood test. And this can last quite a while in some men who
*19:53.140- 19:59.340* :  with little therapy option left over a year of disease control. And we know when that happens that
*19:59.340- 20:04.800* :  as we move these drugs earlier, we get more benefit from these treatments. So we remain hopeful
*20:05.380- 20:09.740* :  that this could have a substantial benefit not only to reverse resistance, but eventually to
*20:09.740- 20:14.940* :  prevent it evolving at all. What are the other similar types of cancer, two prostate cancer that
*20:14.940- 20:20.840* :  you would like to try it on next? There is a lot of evidence that this inflammation, or we call
*20:20.840- 20:26.600* :  the myeloid cells in the blood, if they're more activated by the tumor to feed the tumor, this
*20:26.600- 20:33.100* :  impact outcomes for many cancers and really impact survival substantially. So based on that
*20:33.100- 20:37.960* :  evidence, which is also present in prostate cancer, we believe this may be impactful for many
*20:37.960- 20:43.480* :  tumors and I think this could impact broadly across several cancers. But these tablets you used
*20:43.500- 20:48.860* :  should use something that's already gone through a process. Anyone listening who is in this position
*20:48.860- 20:53.320* :  or no someone in this position will want to have an idea of how they could access it. At present,
*20:53.320- 20:58.740* :  these are only available on trials. More trials are planned with actually better tablets. So still
*20:58.740- 21:03.940* :  much work to do from us, but we will work hard to move this forward to more broad availability as
*21:03.940- 21:10.280* :  soon as we can. Johann de Bonneau. The Oscar-winning actor, Michelle Yo, has been voted on to the
*21:10.280- 21:16.480* :  International Olympic Committee. The 61-year-old was introduced as a Malaysia Junior Squash
*21:16.480- 21:22.020* :  Champion, despite her successful career in Hollywood. Our sports correspondent Alex Capstick
*21:22.020- 21:25.740* :  reports from the organization's meeting in the Indian City of Mumbai.
*21:30.940- 21:35.040* :  Michelle Yo was already a star in Asia when she got her Hollywood breakout role,
*21:35.040- 21:40.480* :  playing a Chinese secret agent working with Pierce Brosnan's James Bond in tomorrow never dies.
*21:41.120- 21:45.560* :  The action theme has continued throughout her career from crouching tiger hidden dragon
*21:45.560- 21:51.340* :  to her Oscar-winning performance in everything everywhere all at once. All of these roles
*21:51.340- 21:56.100* :  build on her sporting background. As a youngster, that was her passion. She was good enough to become
*21:56.100- 22:02.000* :  Malaysia's Junior Squash Champion. And now, Michelle has become a member of the International
*22:02.000- 22:06.760* :  Olympic Committee, an organization with a reputation for being a little bit stuffy,
*22:07.020- 22:11.480* :  and certainly while not known for its pizzazz and glamour. So what was the attraction?
*22:11.660- 22:16.580* :  I never dreamt of being an actress, but as a child, I always dreamt of being an Olympian,
*22:17.520- 22:22.380* :  because sports was very much part of my life going up. And when you watch the Olympics,
*22:22.540- 22:27.860* :  you know that is the epitome of the best of the best and having that pride to be able to
*22:27.860- 22:33.000* :  represent your family. Michelle Yo also said she'd like to get involved in the IOC's team refugee
*22:33.000- 22:38.420* :  program. She's one of eight new members elected at the organization's meeting in Mumbai.
*22:38.540- 22:43.780* :  When the list of names was first proposed last month, the IOC President Thomas Bax said they
*22:43.780- 22:48.840* :  were chosen because of their experience and diverse expertise in different walks of life.
*22:49.400- 22:54.240* :  Michelle agreed that they would all bring something different to the table. She'll soon find out
*22:54.240- 23:00.760* :  what difference her stellar acting career can make in the world of sport. That was Alex Capstick.
*23:00.760- 23:06.320* :  Back to our top story now and the attack on the hospital in Gaza City, which has killed hundreds
*23:06.320- 23:11.880* :  of people. Cannon-Richard Saul is a priest at the Anglican Church of the Diocese of Jerusalem,
*23:12.480- 23:17.740* :  which owns the hospital. We got a missile attack on us on Saturday, which hit the building
*23:17.740- 23:24.160* :  and injured four people. And 5,000 of the people had been sheltering in the grounds of the hospital
*23:24.160- 23:30.420* :  at that point left, fearing that it was not safe. But 1,000 people remained who, you know,
*23:30.420- 23:36.360* :  were probably just too vulnerable, invalidid, or elderly to leave despite the fact that there'd
*23:36.360- 23:41.720* :  been a hit to the hospital. And then the 600 patients, it says 600 bed hospital and then the staff
*23:41.720- 23:47.620* :  there. So it was those who were there and they are the ones that have taken the hit. It just
*23:47.620- 23:55.020* :  sounds horrific and nightmare-ish and I just cannot imagine why vulnerable civilians would be targeted
*23:55.020- 24:02.320* :  like this. After that first hit, were you fearful that maybe there would be other strikes, maybe not
*24:02.320- 24:08.200* :  on this scale, but that it was in the fire? Yeah, definitely. Once that happens and you think
*24:08.200- 24:13.700* :  deliberate or not deliberate, it's in the firing line. And of course it's in the evacuation zone.
*24:13.700- 24:18.900* :  It's north of what he guards us. So the Israelis have said that anywhere in that area could be hit.
*24:19.220- 24:24.720* :  But how can you move patients? How can you move people who have been injured in the attacks or
*24:24.720- 24:30.000* :  there for any other reason? And the hospital staff, the doctors and nurses and others can't leave
*24:30.000- 24:36.320* :  patients in bed to die or to be neglected. And then the 1,000 who were there, they just don't feel
*24:36.320- 24:40.160* :  they've got a choice that some of them don't want to make the long trek south. They don't feel
*24:40.160- 24:48.420* :  it is safe to be on the road. So it's just an utterly intolerable situation. I can't believe that
*24:48.420- 24:55.200* :  this will be allowed to stand. Is there anything you can do to help? We are praying for the situation
*24:55.200- 25:00.360* :  and for the people, for their sustenance, for their courage. But nobody can get in. You can't get
*25:00.360- 25:06.960* :  in. We would send people in. We would get people out. It is impossible. The Israelis have
*25:06.960- 25:13.820* :  declared it as a siege. So when people are vulnerable and dying in a hospital, they are
*25:13.820- 25:19.680* :  totally without help. It's unbelievable. It's hard to find the words properly to describe
*25:19.900- 25:26.260* :  the situation that they're in and how it could be done like this. I find it profoundly
*25:26.260- 25:32.880* :  distressing and disturbing. That was canon, Richard Saul speaking to my colleague, James Kumarasami.
*25:35.840- 25:40.680* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*25:41.140- 25:46.040* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
