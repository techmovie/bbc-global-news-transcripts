*00:31.940- 00:34.340* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.

*01:22.540- 01:25.200* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Thursday,
*01:25.200- 01:27.660* :  the 5th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:28.360- 01:33.760* :  After months of wrangling, EU member states have agreed a plan to overhaul their asylum system.
*01:34.640- 01:39.040* :  Hundreds of Israeli and Palestinian women have come together for peace rallies.
*01:40.080- 01:45.740* :  The 2030 Football World Cup is to be played on three continents opening in South America
*01:45.740- 01:48.840* :  before moving to Morocco, Spain and Portugal.
*01:51.880- 01:52.840* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:52.860- 01:55.680* :  It's stressful because you can't see them.
*01:56.840- 01:59.660* :  That coming out, there's a night, no, by two.
*02:00.240- 02:06.680* :  The Bedbug Panic gripping France as infestations saw ahead of next year's Paris Olympics.
*02:11.420- 02:16.780* :  It's nowhere near the crisis levels of 2015, but the number of migrants trying to make the
*02:16.780- 02:21.200* :  dangerous sea crossing from North Africa to Europe has surged this year,
*02:21.660- 02:27.600* :  as have the number of deaths, with many taking to see in small metal boats that the EU's
*02:27.600- 02:32.020* :  border agency Frontex has described as coffins in water.
*02:32.880- 02:38.320* :  Yet, despite this, the EU has remained divided on how to tackle migration with Mediterranean
*02:38.320- 02:43.500* :  countries like Italy, Greece and Spain, arguing that they're shouldering most of the burden.
*02:44.180- 02:48.800* :  Last week, a rabbi broke out between Germany and Italy after Rome criticized Berlin for
*02:48.800- 02:53.040* :  funding charities that rescue migrants and then bring them to Italy's shores.
*02:53.800- 02:58.440* :  But now those differences have been patched up, as member states have struck a new agreement
*02:58.440- 03:04.100* :  on asylum and migration that will see countries either taking quotas of refugees
*03:04.840- 03:06.720* :  or make payments to other nations.
*03:07.360- 03:12.920* :  The European Commission's Vice President Margaritas Schienes said all member states
*03:13.380- 03:14.920* :  must share responsibility.
*03:15.020- 03:23.080* :  It is morally, politically and legally unfair to delegate the responsibility for our external
*03:23.080- 03:29.820* :  border to the five member states that geography has put them at the perimeter of our union.
*03:30.960- 03:33.380* :  This is a collective task.
*03:34.180- 03:37.180* :  Spain currently holds the presidency of the EU Council.
*03:37.420- 03:42.240* :  A correspondent in Madrid, Guy Hegeco, told us more about this tentative deal.
*03:42.840- 03:47.380* :  This lays out the common stance of the EU countries.
*03:47.380- 03:51.800* :  It lays out a certain framework from which they will then go on and negotiate
*03:51.980- 04:00.400* :  the details of a new asylum and migration policy for the EU when they start negotiations
*04:00.400- 04:01.860* :  with the European Parliament.
*04:01.860- 04:07.680* :  So it's a preliminary agreement and that might make it sound sort of not very important.
*04:07.680- 04:13.300* :  But it is seen by many people as quite significant partly because these are issues
*04:13.300- 04:16.560* :  that are difficult to get some kind of consensus on.
*04:17.180- 04:22.140* :  And also because this is part of a broader position of the EU,
*04:22.140- 04:25.520* :  with which it really wants to overhaul European policy.
*04:25.980- 04:31.440* :  What they've agreed on today deals specifically with how the EU will deal with migration
*04:31.520- 04:34.000* :  and asylum crises in the future.
*04:34.480- 04:36.520* :  But there's not unanimous agreement.
*04:36.520- 04:41.660* :  And this deal was almost scuppard by a row between Italy and Germany last week.
*04:42.100- 04:47.420* :  Yes, that's right, Italy and Germany were at odds over the issue of the use of
*04:47.420- 04:53.800* :  a financing of NGO boats that were in the Mediterranean rescuing migrants.
*04:54.580- 05:00.140* :  And that seemed to put a spoke in the works regarding reaching a deal for the whole EU.
*05:00.700- 05:03.280* :  They actually managed to sort of hammer out their differences.
*05:04.000- 05:08.680* :  And that is no longer a problem, that specific issue between Italy and Germany.
*05:09.340- 05:13.020* :  However, regarding this latest agreement that has been reached,
*05:13.560- 05:15.500* :  it's true there was not unanimity.
*05:15.660- 05:19.040* :  There was enough support for this to be approved by the member states.
*05:19.040- 05:25.760* :  But for example, Hungary and Poland, who on the issue of asylum and migration,
*05:26.540- 05:30.660* :  take a very different stance, they were opposed to this to this agreement.
*05:30.660- 05:34.780* :  So for example, a response from Hungary to this deal was quite angry.
*05:35.240- 05:37.300* :  And it really didn't endorse it at all.
*05:37.640- 05:39.600* :  Poland takes a similar stance as well.
*05:40.300- 05:42.940* :  However, the country is that did support this stance.
*05:42.940- 05:47.540* :  So for example, Spain, which holds the EU Council President sit at the moment,
*05:47.540- 05:50.000* :  described this as a huge step forward.
*05:50.600- 05:53.460* :  And the EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen,
*05:53.740- 05:55.780* :  described it as a real game changer.
*05:55.780- 06:00.840* :  So you have some very contrasting responses to the deal that was hammered out.
*06:01.220- 06:03.700* :  And it does still leave many questions open,
*06:03.700- 06:06.520* :  such as when and how it will be implemented,
*06:07.240- 06:12.640* :  ahead of European elections next year when anti-immigration parties could do well.
*06:13.020- 06:15.860* :  Yes, I mean, the feeling seems to be that many of the member states
*06:15.860- 06:18.280* :  are involved in these talks on this.
*06:18.560- 06:21.740* :  Want to get this approved and then want to discuss this
*06:21.740- 06:24.740* :  and get it approved by the European Parliament
*06:24.740- 06:30.000* :  before the elections next year, because there are a number of countries
*06:30.000- 06:32.680* :  that are seeing a rise of right-wing populism,
*06:33.260- 06:36.980* :  which takes a very tough line on migration and asylum.
*06:37.860- 06:41.360* :  So the feeling is that if this can be approved before that,
*06:42.040- 06:45.980* :  then there will be much less political resistance to it
*06:46.440- 06:49.380* :  than after the elections, which could see a political swing
*06:49.800- 06:53.180* :  towards the right or in many cases the hard right in Europe.
*06:54.000- 06:55.440* :  Guy Hegeko in Spain.
*06:56.320- 06:59.480* :  Hundreds of Israeli and Palestinian women have joined together
*06:59.480- 07:03.080* :  for peace rallies in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.
*07:03.640- 07:05.680* :  Many dressed in white and held placards
*07:05.680- 07:08.740* :  calling for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
*07:08.740- 07:12.320* :  with slogans such as stop killing our children.
*07:12.880- 07:13.920* :  Mike Thompson reports.
*07:14.540- 07:18.460* :  The women's peace rallies come at a time of growing violence in Israel
*07:18.460- 07:22.220* :  than the occupied West Bank, where the talk is more of confrontation
*07:22.220- 07:23.380* :  and compromise.
*07:23.500- 07:28.720* :  The resulting spike in violence has cost the lives of more than 200 Palestinians
*07:28.780- 07:31.900* :  and 32 Israelis so far this year.
*07:32.460- 07:36.400* :  On Wednesday, chanting bannowaving Israeli and Palestinian women
*07:36.760- 07:39.560* :  took to the streets demanding an end to the killing.
*07:40.260- 07:44.720* :  Some Palestinian women are able to obtain permits to join the peace rally
*07:44.720- 07:49.260* :  in Jerusalem staged another one on the West Bank shore of the Dead Sea.
*07:50.280- 07:53.080* :  Mike Thompson. Now to the United States.
*08:00.880- 08:05.940* :  The music of the hugely influential and charismatic rapper Tupac Shakur.
*08:06.300- 08:12.400* :  He was gunned down in Las Vegas in 1996 at the height of his fame at the age of just 25.
*08:13.200- 08:19.020* :  For nearly three decades his murder has inspired dozens of books, articles and documentaries
*08:19.700- 08:23.220* :  questioning why police appeared unable to solve the case.
*08:23.880- 08:27.560* :  Now 27 years after he was killed in a drive by shooting,
*08:28.140- 08:30.880* :  a man has appeared in court charged with his murder.
*08:31.640- 08:35.000* :  On all of the American correspondent Peter Bose told us more about the suspect
*08:35.000- 08:36.540* :  and what happened in court.
*08:37.100- 08:41.280* :  Dwayne Davis, also known as Keefe D, is 60 years old.
*08:41.340- 08:44.140* :  He's a former Los Angeles area gang leader.
*08:44.600- 08:46.840* :  He has long been a suspect in this case.
*08:46.840- 08:50.300* :  This should have been what's known as the arraignment hearing,
*08:50.300- 08:53.140* :  where he would have been asked to plead guilty or not guilty.
*08:53.560- 08:58.760* :  But it was in fact postponed because a lawyer has only just been appointed to represent him.
*08:59.180- 09:02.940* :  And Mr Davis explained briefly that he wasn't able to be there.
*09:02.940- 09:04.820* :  The lawyer at short notice.
*09:04.820- 09:08.760* :  So really for logistical reasons, the hearing was put on hold for a couple of weeks.
*09:08.760- 09:11.840* :  The new court date is October the 19th.
*09:11.840- 09:15.340* :  Dwayne Davis remains in jail pending that hearing.
*09:15.340- 09:19.680* :  He is charged with one count of murder with a deadly weapon.
*09:19.860- 09:21.960* :  So two more weeks to wait, but a lot of people are asking,
*09:21.960- 09:26.560* :  why did it take so long for the authorities to even get to this stage?
*09:26.840- 09:31.640* :  Well, investigators say that it wasn't until recently that they had the evidence
*09:31.640- 09:34.100* :  that they believe will prove their case.
*09:34.100- 09:37.840* :  For many years, this investigation appeared to go cold.
*09:37.840- 09:43.340* :  It went very quiet, although detectives insist that it was never abandoned as some people thought.
*09:43.340- 09:45.840* :  But things changed about five years ago.
*09:45.840- 09:49.160* :  The case was reinvigorated, according to the authorities.
*09:49.160- 09:51.780* :  When Dwayne Davis gave a series of interviews,
*09:52.300- 09:54.080* :  acknowledging his involvement.
*09:54.080- 09:56.580* :  And then he wrote a book, Compton Street Legend,
*09:56.580- 10:03.400* :  in which he said he was in the car from which shots were fired at Tupac Shakur's vehicle.
*10:03.400- 10:06.180* :  The other three men in that car have since died.
*10:06.180- 10:10.580* :  And in July of this year, investigators obtained a search warrant
*10:10.580- 10:11.940* :  for Mr. Davis's home.
*10:12.520- 10:16.960* :  Additional evidence was uncovered that paved the way for the indictment
*10:17.360- 10:18.680* :  that we heard first about last week.
*10:18.920- 10:23.540* :  And Peter, why so much fascination with Tupac Shakur so many years after his death?
*10:23.880- 10:28.580* :  He was seen as a trailblazing artist, a rapper, a poet, very articulate,
*10:28.580- 10:31.900* :  an inspiration to many people that disenfranchise,
*10:31.900- 10:36.660* :  many fans who felt that they were ignored by mainstream media and music.
*10:36.660- 10:40.840* :  He sold over 75 million records, hugely popular.
*10:41.480- 10:45.000* :  He was also an inspiration to other artists, people like Eminem.
*10:45.200- 10:47.640* :  I remember covering his death at the time here in Los Angeles.
*10:47.640- 10:49.240* :  There was shock, there was disbelief,
*10:49.700- 10:54.500* :  and many conspiracy theories circulating about what could have happened.
*10:54.640- 10:56.420* :  And I think for all of those reasons,
*10:56.840- 11:00.480* :  that has just fueled the interest in the events of the last few days.
*11:01.360- 11:05.820* :  Peter Bose, as the authorities in Italy continue to investigate the cause
*11:05.820- 11:08.580* :  of a horrific bus crash on the outskirts of Venice,
*11:08.980- 11:13.000* :  they're looking into the possibility that the driver may have suddenly fallen ill.
*11:13.560- 11:18.560* :  21 people, including several children, died when the tourist bus suddenly plunged off
*11:18.560- 11:20.440* :  an overpass late on Tuesday.
*11:21.100- 11:25.040* :  A southern Europe correspondent Mark Lohan reports from the site of the crash.
*11:25.780- 11:29.220* :  At the spot where the bus took its last catastrophic journey,
*11:29.500- 11:31.500* :  the impact of this crash is clear.
*11:31.920- 11:34.300* :  The guardrails here are the edge of the overpass,
*11:34.300- 11:36.800* :  along which it was traveling, a broken apart,
*11:36.860- 11:39.620* :  smashed as the vehicle careered through,
*11:39.920- 11:42.240* :  hurtling meters down to the railway line below,
*11:42.600- 11:43.820* :  where it burst into flames.
*11:43.820- 11:47.700* :  The bus was carrying tourists back to their nearby campsite
*11:47.940- 11:51.840* :  from a day in central Venice, with Ukrainians and Germans among the dead,
*11:52.180- 11:53.980* :  three of the fatalities young children.
*11:53.980- 11:59.240* :  Beside the overpass, we met 27-year-old Bubacar Ture from Gambia,
*11:59.600- 12:01.920* :  who ran to help when he heard the crash.
*12:03.600- 12:07.180* :  When I arrived, a woman was crying, my baby, my baby, he says,
*12:07.460- 12:10.580* :  I pulled her and her badly burnt son out of the bus,
*12:10.580- 12:13.800* :  then I took the fire extinguisher and tried to douse the flames,
*12:13.800- 12:15.080* :  but it wasn't enough.
*12:15.100- 12:19.120* :  I pulled others from the wreckage who were bleeding from their heads, he goes on.
*12:19.560- 12:23.380* :  When people are dying and need your help, you can't simply walk away.
*12:24.060- 12:27.860* :  CCTV footage shows the bus moving slowly up the overpass,
*12:27.860- 12:31.740* :  and then suddenly and inexplicably toppling off the side.
*12:31.740- 12:36.840* :  The most likely cause the authorities say was that the Italian driver suddenly fell ill,
*12:37.180- 12:38.800* :  causing his disastrous turn.
*12:39.640- 12:41.480* :  Several of the injured remain in hospital,
*12:41.920- 12:45.640* :  among them two young German brothers who lost both parents,
*12:45.640- 12:49.220* :  when the joy of a late summer holiday in beautiful Venice,
*12:49.800- 12:51.660* :  turned to unimaginable horror.
*12:52.680- 12:53.920* :  Mark Lohan, initially.
*12:55.340- 12:58.400* :  Next to football and the world's governing body FIFA has announced
*12:58.400- 13:03.440* :  that the 2030 World Cup will be jointly hosted by Morocco, Portugal and Spain,
*13:03.440- 13:08.480* :  but Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay will play their opening matches at home.
*13:09.040- 13:12.400* :  The deal puts an end to the contest between the two rival bids.
*13:12.800- 13:16.040* :  The three South American nations had claimed the right to host the World Cup
*13:16.040- 13:20.340* :  to mark the centenary of the first FIFA competition which was played in Uruguay.
*13:21.100- 13:25.360* :  Ed Harry spoke to Martin Kesman, a football broadcaster at Universal 980,
*13:25.360- 13:30.100* :  in Montevideo, so how has this announcement been greeted there in Uruguay?
*13:30.460- 13:33.080* :  People in Uruguay know they love all the football,
*13:33.700- 13:38.760* :  and having again this party about the world in sports is really a very nice new.
*13:39.320- 13:42.520* :  And we are going to have the first match in our principal stadium,
*13:42.520- 13:47.720* :  that it's called Stadio Centenario, the first field that we construct for 1930,
*13:48.440- 13:53.100* :  and we have the chance to have another World Cup inside 100 years later.
*13:53.480- 13:54.800* :  You mentioned it being a party.
*13:55.400- 13:59.760* :  It's still what, seven years away, but just how big now that we know it's coming,
*13:59.760- 14:06.560* :  how big might those celebrations be to mark, as you say, 100 years on from Montevideo
*14:06.940- 14:09.500* :  beginning the legacy of the FIFA World Cup?
*14:09.840- 14:15.940* :  I think that the party is to celebrate 100 out of the creation of the World Cups in our country,
*14:16.440- 14:19.860* :  but I can't imagine what is going to happen in the next seven years.
*14:20.300- 14:22.280* :  We have to imagine a strong squad.
*14:22.280- 14:26.280* :  We have to imagine a good moment of our country in sports.
*14:26.800- 14:31.240* :  So many items is going to be important to analyze in that moment.
*14:31.240- 14:36.120* :  But now we are all elucinated with this chance to have the first match
*14:36.120- 14:38.400* :  in the beginning of a new World Cup in 2013.
*14:39.020- 14:42.020* :  Match as well, of course, in Paraguay, in Argentina.
*14:42.020- 14:45.440* :  Is there, though, any sense of disappointment today
*14:45.440- 14:48.580* :  that South America hasn't been awarded the whole tournament?
*14:48.920- 14:53.560* :  First, the president of Commebol, Alejandro Amingues, explain why we can't be
*14:54.060- 14:58.100* :  the all-organicated in the World Cup because of economical situation,
*14:58.100- 15:03.460* :  because some other countries are best prepared at us in economical situations.
*15:04.120- 15:07.880* :  But this is what we can organize and what we can afford.
*15:08.520- 15:11.620* :  For Argentina, it's another stage to have a World Cup.
*15:11.620- 15:16.180* :  In 1978, they were the organisator and also the World Champions.
*15:16.720- 15:20.420* :  In Paraguay, we never have the chance to have a World Cup.
*15:20.780- 15:24.620* :  Chile is waiting also the chance to organize some matches.
*15:25.180- 15:28.000* :  So I think that South America have to be happy because
*15:28.000- 15:30.940* :  it's not a continent strong in economical situation
*15:30.940- 15:34.220* :  and we have to be available to organize
*15:34.220- 15:37.100* :  what the FIFA gave us as the chance.
*15:37.840- 15:40.460* :  You're a grand football broadcaster, Martin Kesman.
*15:40.960- 15:43.600* :  With the FIFA World Cup being held on three continents,
*15:43.600- 15:47.900* :  there are also concerns about sustainability and the effect on climate change.
*15:48.380- 15:52.920* :  Ed Harry also spoke to Dr. Madeline Orr, an academic from the University of Toronto,
*15:52.920- 15:56.380* :  who researchers and lectures in sport sustainability.
*15:57.220- 15:58.780* :  It's pretty shocking, to be honest.
*15:58.840- 16:02.600* :  You know, we heard a lot of talk after the Qatar World Cup
*16:02.620- 16:05.060* :  that they wanted to focus on sustainability,
*16:05.060- 16:08.640* :  that there would be consideration for carbon emissions moving forward
*16:09.160- 16:13.920* :  in FIFA events, particularly after they came under so much scrutiny during Qatar.
*16:14.480- 16:16.740* :  And then we get this announcement and it's essentially,
*16:16.740- 16:21.320* :  you know, flying in the face of all commitments they've made on sustainability.
*16:21.320- 16:23.340* :  So from my perspective, it's pretty shocking,
*16:23.340- 16:25.960* :  but sadly not totally surprising.
*16:25.960- 16:28.080* :  You know, they wanted to make a big splash.
*16:28.080- 16:30.920* :  It's an anniversary, but it's still a huge problem.
*16:31.440- 16:33.620* :  You know, the one thing they could do would be to
*16:34.100- 16:37.960* :  ban fans from traveling to all these different places and focus on local fans.
*16:38.320- 16:39.880* :  I just don't think they want to do that, right?
*16:39.880- 16:42.880* :  They want to throw a party, they want to have this big celebration
*16:42.880- 16:47.520* :  and the results will be untold tens of thousands of flights all around the world.
*16:47.520- 16:48.780* :  And that's the problem.
*16:48.780- 16:52.520* :  There's no way to square a vision of a sustainable event,
*16:52.520- 16:57.280* :  quote unquote, with kind of the footprint that is kind of doomed to come
*16:57.560- 16:59.360* :  with this particular layout.
*16:59.760- 17:02.900* :  If they're using old venues, they can maybe make some games there.
*17:02.900- 17:06.600* :  Whereas in Qatar, you know, it was tricky because they had to bring in
*17:06.600- 17:10.100* :  not only new venues, but every piece of material had to come in
*17:10.460- 17:12.860* :  flown in from scratch, including everybody building it.
*17:13.120- 17:15.860* :  So Qatar had a bunch of construction side issues,
*17:16.280- 17:17.980* :  and then, you know, flights during the event.
*17:17.980- 17:21.640* :  But this just flights could absolutely topple that record.
*17:22.000- 17:26.560* :  And we could see the most environmentally unsustainable FIFA World Cup on record.
*17:27.340- 17:29.600* :  Dr. Matin or from the University of Toronto.
*17:29.660- 17:33.680* :  The BBC has asked FIFA for a comment on the issue of sustainability,
*17:33.840- 17:35.980* :  but was told no one is available.
*17:36.920- 17:40.420* :  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has announced that it's to bid to host the
*17:40.420- 17:47.140* :  2034 World Cup, the Saudi Football Federation that it intended to deliver a world-class tournament.
*17:47.940- 17:53.360* :  The move marks the Gulf Kingdom's latest step to turn itself into a global sporting destination.
*17:56.400- 17:57.380* :  Still to come on the podcast.
*17:57.820- 18:04.280* :  I'm determined to stick with my Lord Afflemitment to minimise the environmental impact of my work.
*18:04.640- 18:06.640* :  So I'm not going to make a claim.
*18:07.220- 18:12.820* :  The climate researcher who says he's facing the sack for refusing to fly back from an assignment abroad.

*19:03.900- 19:06.300* :  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.
*19:06.620- 19:10.220* :  So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising their prices due to inflation,
*19:10.220- 19:14.020* :  we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

*19:42.860- 19:44.200* :  Expect the unexpected.
*19:44.880- 19:46.520* :  We were having a big, tearful discussion.
*19:47.000- 19:47.940* :  How could someone ever do this?
*19:48.200- 19:49.020* :  How could that ever happen?
*19:49.360- 19:53.920* :  And that's the first time I ever came out with my story about how I was almost a school shooter.
*19:54.360- 19:57.380* :  Live's Less Ordinary from the BBC World Service.

*20:02.140- 20:03.900* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*20:04.440- 20:09.880* :  At least 10 people have been killed and more than 80 are missing after heavy rain caused
*20:09.880- 20:13.000* :  flash floods in the Northeastern Indian state of Sikkim.
*20:13.000- 20:19.360* :  A hydropower dam was breached and more than 20 Indian soldiers are among those unaccounted for.
*20:19.960- 20:22.360* :  With the details, here's our South Asia Regional Editor,
*20:22.680- 20:23.960* :  Umbhrasan Etirajan.
*21:07.960- 21:13.820* :  A key moment in Canadian history. A member of the First Nations community has been elected
*21:13.820- 21:15.320* :  leader of a province.
*21:15.960- 21:19.360* :  Vaabkhanu has been voted in as Premier of Manitoba.
*21:20.020- 21:25.060* :  Canada is home to nearly 2 million indigenous people, about 5% of its population,
*21:25.660- 21:29.580* :  but they're severely underrepresented in Canadian government and politics.
*21:30.260- 21:34.400* :  Our reporter, Peter Goffin, told us more about the significance of this election.
*21:35.100- 21:37.920* :  Vaabkhanu has been in the public eye for a long time.
*21:37.920- 21:43.860* :  In Canada, as a journalist, a musician, an activist, he's only 41 years old,
*21:43.900- 21:49.720* :  but leading this left-wing party, the new Democratic party, to power, is just the latest act
*21:49.720- 21:53.380* :  in a long career of indigenous advocacy.
*21:53.380- 21:56.020* :  Now, Manitoba is right in the middle of Canada.
*21:56.020- 21:59.260* :  It's a vast, largely rural province.
*21:59.260- 22:02.620* :  And like a lot of the country, it is sparsely populated.
*22:02.620- 22:06.380* :  But 18% of the people who do live there are indigenous.
*22:06.380- 22:11.660* :  And that's the highest proportion of Canada's 10 provinces when it comes to indigenous population.
*22:11.740- 22:17.100* :  The main Manitoba city, Winnipeg, is home to more than 100,000 indigenous people.
*22:17.100- 22:20.700* :  And that's the largest single indigenous community in Canada.
*22:20.700- 22:26.460* :  And yet, it has taken 150 years from Manitoba to elect a First Nations leader.
*22:26.460- 22:31.460* :  If you go all the way back to the 1870s, there was a Premier who was Métis,
*22:31.800- 22:35.600* :  which is a culture of historically mixed indigenous and European heritage.
*22:35.600- 22:40.460* :  But now here's Vaabkhanu, a member of the Anishinaabe people who spent part of his childhood
*22:40.460- 22:45.800* :  on a First Nations Reserve who campaigned to improve health care and cost of living
*22:45.800- 22:50.020* :  as Premier of Manitoba, and who speaks openly about turning his life around
*22:50.020- 22:56.120* :  after struggling with alcohol and being arrested as a young man for assault and drink driving.
*22:56.560- 22:58.140* :  Here's a bit of his victory speech.
*22:58.360- 23:00.820* :  I was given a second chance in life.
*23:05.940- 23:10.300* :  And I would like to think that I've made good on that opportunity.
*23:12.340- 23:15.400* :  And so, to young people who are looking for a positive path,
*23:15.400- 23:18.100* :  I want to share the words that my father always told us.
*23:25.480- 23:29.180* :  So Peter, an important moment for the province of Manitoba, and it's new Premier,
*23:29.180- 23:31.280* :  but how about Canada as a whole?
*23:32.120- 23:35.660* :  Well, it's safe to say, Jeanette, that this is the most national attention
*23:35.660- 23:39.860* :  in a Manitoba provincial election has received in a long time.
*23:39.860- 23:43.400* :  But Vaabkhanu's victory has struck a chord right across Canada,
*23:43.960- 23:48.040* :  because indigenous under-representation is a problem right across Canada.
*23:48.560- 23:53.340* :  And there is a concern voiced by many indigenous people that they're being left behind.
*23:53.580- 23:58.660* :  Indigenous people on average in Canada have poorer health and education outcomes,
*23:58.780- 24:04.600* :  higher rates of poverty, and addiction, and higher rates of interaction with the justice system.
*24:05.160- 24:08.040* :  Major inequities that need to be addressed.
*24:08.180- 24:12.580* :  And you know, we've been reporting for the last several weeks on Australia's referendum
*24:12.580- 24:16.680* :  to establish an official Indigenous advisory body for its parliament.
*24:17.260- 24:21.360* :  New Zealand has parliamentary seats set aside for Maori politicians.
*24:22.200- 24:25.080* :  Canada doesn't have anything like that, but bit by bit,
*24:25.080- 24:30.100* :  political representation at a high level is improving for indigenous people in Canada.
*24:30.100- 24:34.660* :  Two of Canada's northern territories are now led by indigenous people.
*24:34.660- 24:38.240* :  That's an addition to Vaabkhanu in the province of Manitoba.
*24:38.240- 24:40.380* :  The Governor-General is an Inuit woman.
*24:40.380- 24:45.420* :  These are steps towards giving Indigenous people in Canada the voice they want,
*24:45.420- 24:48.300* :  and the voice they deserve. Peter Goffin.
*24:48.820- 24:53.000* :  The Swedish climate activist, Greater Thunberg, made headlines in 2019
*24:53.000- 24:56.560* :  when she refused to fly to a global warming summit in New York,
*24:56.560- 24:59.420* :  instead spending two weeks at sea to get there.
*25:00.120- 25:02.840* :  Now, a climate researcher is facing a similar dilemma
*25:02.840- 25:07.120* :  after his German employers ordered him to fly back from the Solomon Islands
*25:07.540- 25:09.580* :  where he's been working for the past six months.
*25:10.280- 25:15.600* :  Dr. Jan Luka Grimelder says he could lose his job if he doesn't return to Germany immediately.
*25:16.280- 25:19.480* :  Despite this, he's refusing to fly for environmental reasons.
*25:20.160- 25:23.720* :  He told my colleague, Nulema Goffin, that he'd been due to come home last month,
*25:24.100- 25:26.600* :  but his work in the Solomon Islands was held up.
*25:27.180- 25:31.700* :  After about two and a half weeks, myself and my research team
*25:31.700- 25:36.800* :  were picked him up in ambush, in which S-combatants held us hostage,
*25:37.440- 25:43.540* :  under threat of machete, and they asked for a ransom or the release of all my belongings.
*25:44.420- 25:47.820* :  Then we had another security threat of this kind,
*25:48.260- 25:50.720* :  and that, of course, slowed down the whole process.
*25:51.020- 25:54.780* :  I mean, that's a very dramatic reason.
*25:54.780- 25:58.300* :  And I'm very glad that you are doing well now.
*25:58.300- 26:04.460* :  But let's get into the crux of this, which is, if you don't go back, you will be fired.
*26:05.180- 26:08.300* :  Are you prepared to take a plane so that doesn't happen?
*26:09.000- 26:17.600* :  After two days of, I must say, very grueling meditation, I decided not to return by plane.
*26:17.900- 26:22.980* :  They would probably, again, issue a request for me to come back in two or three days,
*26:22.980- 26:28.640* :  and I will not go back and determine to stick with my moral commitment
*26:29.020- 26:31.600* :  to minimize the environmental impact of my work.
*26:31.900- 26:33.920* :  So I'm not going to take a plane.
*26:34.080- 26:41.800* :  So you are prepared to lose your job over this moral commitment as you call it to the climate?
*26:42.400- 26:46.240* :  Yes, of course, it's something that I mean, many people will say that I'm crazy.
*26:46.240- 26:51.120* :  Actually, I ask for some advice to friends, to other climate activists,
*26:51.660- 26:54.280* :  and nobody told me you are doing the right thing.
*26:54.280- 26:58.100* :  Everybody told me, take a plane, keep your job, your job, it's you enough,
*26:58.100- 27:03.860* :  economic stability in order for you to be able to pursue the climate cause in different ways.
*27:04.300- 27:09.200* :  But I said to myself, I really kind of do it, because this moral commitment that I have is too strong.
*27:09.760- 27:16.780* :  I want to sound the alarm, because I do think that we are in a terrible situation with respect to
*27:17.180- 27:18.120* :  our climate.
*27:18.660- 27:23.680* :  So I just think that what I'm doing, actually, it's not crazy, but it's the right thing to do,
*27:23.960- 27:27.960* :  because it is instead the crazy that we keep on with the business as you draw.
*27:28.640- 27:32.540* :  The BBC asked Dr Gramelda's employer the Keel Institute for an interview.
*27:32.720- 27:37.760* :  They said no, but told us we remain committed to our policy of not publicly discussing
*27:37.760- 27:40.380* :  or commenting on personal legal matters.
*27:41.020- 27:46.360* :  In general, the institute encourages and supports its staff to travel in a climate-friendly way.
*27:46.840- 27:52.740* :  And we paid CO2 compensation for all business trips made by our employees by air.
*27:53.920- 27:58.940* :  Indonesia has a second highest number of TikTok users worldwide after the United States,
*27:58.940- 28:02.760* :  many of whom use the e-commerce feature TikTok shop.
*28:03.360- 28:07.480* :  But now the government has forced the social media app to remove the shopping feature
*28:08.000- 28:12.460* :  following protests by traders in Jakarta, who say is damaging their business.
*28:13.100- 28:19.180* :  This trader, called Ciamsel, has a store in Indonesia's biggest textile market, Tana Abang.
*28:23.120- 28:25.720* :  Almost nobody buys. It's fallen drastically.
*28:25.720- 28:29.220* :  I don't know about the others, but from my own experience, it's been like that.
*28:29.800- 28:34.140* :  I've lost at least 95% of my usual profits, only gaining 5% a month.
*28:35.180- 28:39.020* :  I can barely afford food with the money, much less pay the rent to operate in this building.
*28:40.280- 28:42.480* :  I have to pay for the service charge, the electricity.
*28:43.160- 28:45.700* :  I used to have an employee working here, but now I don't anymore.
*28:46.280- 28:49.980* :  I had two shops, one of them I had to shut down because I couldn't afford the service charge.
*28:50.640- 28:53.580* :  I went through a whole month without a single buyer, no income at all.
*28:54.620- 28:57.880* :  Some business owners in the country have embraced selling online.
*28:58.540- 29:02.840* :  For more on what led to this TikTok shopping ban, my colleague Vivian Nunes
*29:02.920- 29:05.860* :  spoke to Trisha Dantiani in Jakarta.
*29:06.560- 29:13.560* :  The traders in Tana Abang market in Central Jakarta, which is the largest textile market in Southeast Asia,
*29:14.220- 29:19.620* :  they've been in dire conditions since the pandemic and also with the rapid growth of e-commerce,
*29:20.340- 29:23.880* :  and even more so with social commerce, which is TikTok shop.
*29:23.920- 29:30.760* :  We've spoken to a number of sellers who do business in the market, and they admitted that they've
*29:31.040- 29:37.220* :  been losing revenue around 30 to 95% of their offline revenue has been hindered by the existence
*29:37.220- 29:43.480* :  of these sellers on TikTok shop because the products that they sell there, the prices are
*29:43.880- 29:47.860* :  unbelievably cheaper compared to the same product sold offline.
*29:48.720- 29:53.520* :  That's why people prefer to buy them online instead of going to the markets.
*29:53.660- 29:59.440* :  They've been holding these protests and putting up signs demanding that the government close down
*29:59.440- 30:02.220* :  TikTok shop and the government has spoken.
*30:02.740- 30:07.680* :  Okay, so a victory for the market traders in the capital Jakarta, but what about the millions
*30:07.680- 30:12.940* :  of Indonesian small business holders that have been using the platform to sell their wares?
*30:13.520- 30:19.940* :  Yeah, there has been a bit of, I would say, resistance from TikTok because they say that they're
*30:19.940- 30:25.900* :  helping these small medium businesses, but on their hand, it's also not regulated as well.
*30:26.100- 30:31.440* :  The small medium businesses online. Last time I checked the app, people are still trying to sell
*30:31.440- 30:36.940* :  their items and I just opened the app a few minutes ago and they were saying, okay, TikTok shop
*30:36.940- 30:42.240* :  is going to close, so we're sort of like a sell all. They want to sell, they want to finish off their
*30:42.240- 30:47.900* :  stock, they want to sell all their items in one go before the app features closes. They also have
*30:47.900- 30:53.980* :  other avenues actually because other than TikTok shop, they also have Tokopedia and Shopee and
*30:53.980- 31:00.360* :  those other e-commerce apps and usually sellers have multiple accounts on different platforms.
*31:00.360- 31:05.640* :  So I think that's why there hasn't been that much of an uproar against this ban.
*31:06.240- 31:13.500* :  Trisha Danciani in Indonesia. The Olympics often come with jeopardy. Will costs overrun?
*31:13.780- 31:19.040* :  Will things be ready on time? Will there be a boycott? But next year's games in Paris are
*31:19.040- 31:24.840* :  dealing with something rather more unusual, a fear of bedbugs. There have been increasing reports
*31:24.840- 31:31.480* :  of the blood-sucking insects on trains, in cinemas and investing people's homes and one television
*31:31.480- 31:38.200* :  presenter was even accused of racism after suggesting migrants might be to blame. So serious is a
*31:38.200- 31:42.060* :  problem that sniffer dogs have been deployed as Husko field reports.
*31:42.980- 31:43.280* :  Yes.
*31:46.200- 31:51.580* :  Set a dog to catch a bug. Oli, the spring-ass spaniel, has been specially trained to sniff out
*31:51.580- 31:57.180* :  bedbugs and right now he's looking for a whiff in a Paris flat. The owner, Jacques de chef de bia,
*31:57.180- 32:02.060* :  has been bitten and so is his wife. They're so spooked, they threw their bed into the street.
*32:02.780- 32:09.240* :  It's stressful because you can't see them that coming out as a night. You see I'm sleeping
*32:09.260- 32:16.500* :  on the floor and knowing that maybe there's some little insects that are coming out from the floor
*32:16.660- 32:21.020* :  and bite you. No, it's difficult to live with that.
*32:22.760- 32:27.540* :  Jacques's case is one of thousands in France at the moment. Pest control companies are stretched
*32:27.540- 32:31.980* :  to the limit and it's not just beds that the bedbugs are frequenting. There are stories
*32:31.980- 32:35.980* :  unverified but plausible of bugs in cinemas and on trains.
*32:42.340- 32:47.600* :  It's so bad, it's turned political. On Tuesday, one mb brandished a capsule of bedbugs in
*32:47.600- 32:51.400* :  parliament as she demanded government help for bedbugs victims.
*32:54.300- 32:59.740* :  Experts say things are bad, they're perhaps not quite as bad as their portrayed.
*32:59.740- 33:05.140* :  During the last 10 years, like in most big cities in the world, we have seen an increase in bedbugs
*33:05.840- 33:12.380* :  Nicolas Roudabasier runs a bedbugs control company. Basically, it's doubled every five years.
*33:12.940- 33:18.300* :  But right now we also have a kind of a mediatic bubble. Of course, there is a real phenomenon
*33:18.300- 33:23.000* :  behind it but it's not as big as the media could let you think in France.
*33:27.660- 33:32.020* :  Down in Marseille, France's main medical research center in the bugs and insects.
*33:32.340- 33:35.660* :  And I was shown around by chief enthomologist Jean-Michel Berrongey.
*33:36.360- 33:41.740* :  He too says there's definitely been a resurgence of bedbugs in recent years, mainly caused by
*33:41.740- 33:47.320* :  the movement of people around the globe. But because previously they'd largely been eradicated in
*33:47.320- 33:52.560* :  France and other developed countries, their return now is creating something akin to panic.
*33:55.020- 33:59.680* :  When you talk to old people, they can remember bedbugs and they say, oh yes, we did this
*33:59.680- 34:05.200* :  of that to get rid of them and it's not a big issue for them. But today, not that bedbugs are
*34:05.200- 34:09.880* :  back, people living in our very sterile, modern world are panicked and a bit lost.
*34:12.720- 34:17.060* :  What we're doing is an experiment now and Dr Berrongey is very kindly placed a tiny
*34:18.360- 34:24.680* :  young bedbug on that. Dr Berrongey says we need to demystify bedbugs so we're not quite so
*34:24.680- 34:29.560* :  freaked out by them and one way to do that is to see them in action. And that's what's happening
*34:29.560- 34:35.560* :  here. He's put a bedbug on the back of my hand. It's a weird sensation because I feel
*34:35.560- 34:41.760* :  absolutely nothing. I can just about see this speck on my hand, but on the computer with it's
*34:42.540- 34:46.840* :  blown up, I don't know how many hundreds of times, I can see that this thing gorging itself with my
*34:46.840- 34:55.760* :  blood and pumping my blood into its body. He's going to build in France going above and beyond
*34:55.760- 35:02.580* :  the call of duty to report impartially on bedbugs. And that's all from us for now,
*35:02.580- 35:06.980* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on
*35:06.980- 35:14.820* :  this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email. The address is globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk.

*35:37.200- 35:41.860* :  That world has in up and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*35:42.140- 35:48.460* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed like I'd never seen anything
*35:48.460- 35:54.580* :  like this. At the height of Abercrombie and Fitzgera's success. This was me being carefully manipulated.
*35:54.580- 36:00.580* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that would take me
*36:00.580- 36:09.520* :  into a world of money, sex and power. This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
*36:09.780- 36:11.900* :  Listen wherever you get your podcasts.
