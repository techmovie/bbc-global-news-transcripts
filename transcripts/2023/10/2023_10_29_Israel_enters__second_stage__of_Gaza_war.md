*00:35.720- 00:38.800* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:40.580- 00:45.620* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Sunday the 29th of October these are our main stories.
*00:46.300- 00:51.440* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his first priority is to win the war
*00:51.440- 00:56.660* :  against Hamas and Gaza, bringing home the hostages being held by Hamas comes second.
*00:57.600- 01:02.700* :  The UN has warned that Israeli ground operations in Gaza could have catastrophic humanitarian
*01:02.700- 01:09.060* :  consequences. Iranian media say a teenage girl who fell into a coma after a alleged
*01:09.060- 01:17.140* :  confrontation with the morality police has died. Also in this podcast. It was a wet night in Paris,
*01:17.140- 01:22.200* :  a match full of drama and tension. South Africa have made history at the rugby world cup,
*01:22.700- 01:27.300* :  beating New Zealand at the final in Paris to win a record fourth title.
*01:31.720- 01:38.140* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war in Gaza has entered a second stage.
*01:38.640- 01:43.900* :  As Israel's bombardment of the territory intensified alongside a large ground operation,
*01:43.900- 01:50.440* :  Mr Netanyahu also warned that the war would be long and difficult. The Prime Minister said his
*01:50.440- 01:56.360* :  first priority was to win the conflict against Hamas in Gaza. After meeting the families of
*01:56.360- 02:03.100* :  some of the more than 200 hostages held in captivity, he said bringing them home would be the second goal.
*02:05.400- 02:12.180* :  There are those who think that there is a contradiction between bringing the hostages home at any
*02:12.180- 02:19.280* :  price and dismantling the Hamas. No, there is no contradiction. We will not change,
*02:19.300- 02:26.620* :  suddenly what the objective is. We intend to give the Hamas a lethal blow, but in addition,
*02:26.680- 02:31.220* :  our second objective, of course, is bringing the hostages home.
*02:32.220- 02:37.900* :  Mr Netanyahu also confirmed that Israeli troops were active all over Gaza in what he called
*02:37.900- 02:48.540* :  the stronghold of evil. We are carrying out massive air strikes in order to assist our ground
*02:48.540- 03:00.900* :  forces as they go in. And we have targeted killings and destroyed headquarters of the Hamas.
*03:01.540- 03:12.140* :  This will be a long war. It is our second war of independence. We will fight and we will
*03:12.180- 03:23.880* :  not surrender. We will not withdraw overgrounds and underground. It will be a victory of the good
*03:23.880- 03:29.960* :  over evil. Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem, was listening to Mr
*03:30.000- 03:35.180* :  Netanyahu's address. I asked him about the Prime Minister's comments on the hostages and how
*03:35.180- 03:41.380* :  their families were likely to react. Mr Netanyahu will have disappointed them. He said that his heart
*03:41.380- 03:46.780* :  broke when he met them, but that he was determined to press ahead with his operation to destroy
*03:46.780- 03:51.980* :  Hamas, both politically and militarily. He said that getting the hostages out was a secondary
*03:51.980- 03:58.300* :  objective. And he also said that there was no contradiction between these two objectives of
*03:58.300- 04:04.580* :  defeating Hamas and getting hostages released. His Defence Minister, Yohav Galant, said the more we
*04:04.580- 04:09.740* :  hit out at them, i.e. Hamas, we know that they will be willing to reach some kind of agreement.
*04:09.900- 04:14.780* :  The strategy does seem to be very much to keep up the military pressure on Hamas and hope
*04:14.780- 04:20.140* :  that that yields results. Mr Netanyahu is saying that this will be a long and difficult war
*04:20.140- 04:25.740* :  talking about forces in the north and the south of Gaza. Is he preparing Israel for a full
*04:25.740- 04:31.960* :  ground invasion or something more limited or gradual? We have no real way of knowing that because
*04:31.960- 04:37.920* :  the Israelis are not indicating the true nature of their plans and why would they? What we are seeing
*04:37.920- 04:44.180* :  is a steady escalation. The operation that was launched more than 24 hours ago is still going on.
*04:44.180- 04:51.240* :  We believe and it does seem to be bigger in scope than previous incursions. But it is possible
*04:51.240- 04:56.620* :  that we will see more of this kind of thing. I was talking to a Western diplomat yesterday
*04:56.620- 05:03.080* :  who was saying that the advice that they're giving to Israel is to try and gradually ramp up the
*05:03.080- 05:09.460* :  pace and the scope of its military operation rather than go for a kind of grand d-day style
*05:09.460- 05:15.880* :  all out offensive because that might be the kind of thing that would trigger a regional response
*05:15.880- 05:21.640* :  from people like Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Shiite militia groups in Iraq, and
*05:21.640- 05:27.840* :  there's a real fear among Israel's allies of a regional conflagration. And so they're urging,
*05:27.840- 05:32.920* :  I think, Israel to be as cautious as they can be. His words of reassurance that there's no
*05:32.920- 05:37.520* :  contradiction in destroying Hamas and bringing hostages by home is not really reassuring
*05:37.520- 05:43.320* :  many in Israel. There's been an offer from Hamas to free all the hostages it has in return
*05:43.320- 05:49.660* :  for Palestinian prisoners. How is Israel likely to respond to that? This was the first public
*05:49.660- 05:56.360* :  comments from the leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya al-Sinwa, they appeared on the Hamas website
*05:56.380- 06:03.140* :  offering to exchange all hostages for all Hamas prisoners held in Israeli prisons.
*06:03.180- 06:11.160* :  It is an idea that some former defense and security officials in Israel think would be a good idea,
*06:11.160- 06:16.240* :  a price worth paying in their view, but it is not one that the Israeli government has so far
*06:16.240- 06:23.120* :  indicated any willingness to explore. Paul Adams in Jerusalem civilians in Gaza remain cut off
*06:23.180- 06:27.420* :  from the outside world because phone lines in the internet are down for most people.
*06:28.160- 06:32.580* :  The UN says these cuts could mask atrocities being committed in the territory.
*06:33.420- 06:38.980* :  Today the Hamas run health ministry in Gaza says more than seven and a half thousand Palestinians
*06:38.980- 06:45.540* :  have been killed. Israel has been bombing Gaza since the 7th of October when Hamas attacks
*06:45.560- 06:53.400* :  killed 1,400 people in Israel and saw more than 200 others kidnapped as hostages.
*06:54.160- 06:59.080* :  So far only four of them have been released. Speaking to the BBC the head of the Palestinian
*06:59.080- 07:05.520* :  mission to the UK, who Sam Zomlot dismissed Israel's claims this operation was aimed at Hamas.
*07:06.320- 07:12.580* :  Targeting our family's neighborhood killing 8,000 among them 3,000 children in
*07:12.580- 07:17.860* :  the targeting Hamas, bombing hospitals and targeting Hamas, bombing churches and mosque
*07:17.860- 07:23.160* :  targeting Hamas, bombing our entire civil infrastructure, rescue teams, medical teams,
*07:23.160- 07:27.300* :  what have you, targeting Hamas, cutting water and food and electricity, cutting
*07:27.720- 07:33.100* :  chemical communication, Israel is not fighting Hamas, Israel is fighting our people and not only in Gaza.
*07:33.940- 07:39.160* :  Despite those problems with communications, our correspondent Ruchdi Abu Al-Luth managed to
*07:39.160- 07:44.080* :  send this report via a satellite phone on Saturday from southern Gaza.
*08:08.700- 08:14.120* :  Hospital was out of service because no fuel and was evacuated but today the main building of
*08:14.120- 08:19.440* :  the hospital was destroyed. Also around Chifra Hospital in Gaza City there was a lot of
*08:19.440- 08:23.980* :  airstrikes, 10-15 airstrikes according to people around Chifra Hospital. They are cutting
*08:23.980- 08:30.860* :  most of the roads towards that hospital. Communication is extremely difficult. We are
*08:30.940- 08:36.700* :  unable to verify a lot of reports about the number of people did or injured but the health
*08:36.700- 08:43.220* :  ministry was doing a risk conference this afternoon. They said about 400 people were killed overnight
*08:43.220- 08:49.440* :  but they said hundreds other are missing under the collapsed building in the north. Also the
*08:49.440- 08:56.900* :  biggest refugee camp in Gaza, if you can, also was bombed heavily. I saw very strong footage of
*08:56.900- 09:03.160* :  destruction inside the camp with about 100,000 people they live in this camp. About half
*09:03.160- 09:09.200* :  a million people are still living in Gaza City and the area where Israel asked the people to leave
*09:09.200- 09:18.360* :  to the south. Tonight more airstrikes, more Israeli airplanes flying over Gaza City and people
*09:18.360- 09:25.500* :  are expecting more heavy bombing night. Ruchdi Abu Al-Luth in southern Gaza has we just been hearing
*09:25.500- 09:30.180* :  the Israeli Prime Minister met the families of some of the hostages being held in Gaza.
*09:30.780- 09:35.420* :  After the meeting this man flanked by other people whose relatives were taken hostage by Hamas,
*09:35.820- 09:42.380* :  had this message for Benjamin Netanyahu. We have been for a long meeting with the Prime Minister
*09:43.460- 09:52.120* :  Galleers and other people. We were very loud and clear speaking about the situation now.
*09:52.120- 10:02.660* :  We were speaking about our concern, about what we feel and about our worried, about the military
*10:02.660- 10:10.000* :  operation that have been done or done now. We are very worried about our dearest that they are
*10:10.000- 10:18.900* :  there and we don't know that if the whole military operation take all these hostages under consideration
*10:19.620- 10:24.900* :  that nobody will be injured and of course we say that we want
*10:25.020- 10:35.380* :  whole the hostages back home, all the hostages. It will not be part by part. It will be all the
*10:35.380- 10:48.940* :  hostages with any negotiation that will be with the enemy. So we were very clear about that all
*10:48.940- 10:58.540* :  the hostages will come back home with any kind of negotiation that will be done, that we want
*10:58.540- 11:06.340* :  all back and we don't care what they will give for that. So that's what we were very clear.
*11:07.100- 11:16.100* :  Prime Minister was listening to everything and he said that he will do everything for that.
*11:17.600- 11:22.860* :  Rudy Goran, whose cousin is among the more than 200 being held in Gaza, says
*11:22.860- 11:28.560* :  freeing the hostages should be the government's top priority. As far as the hostage families are
*11:28.560- 11:35.220* :  concerned, it's unfathomable that this is not Israel's top priority, that there are ministers in
*11:35.220- 11:40.880* :  the government that say that we should sacrifice these people for going after Hamas, not only
*11:40.880- 11:47.100* :  referring to government officials, referring to the fact that this is not Israel's top priority,
*11:47.100- 11:53.260* :  it's just unimaginable. And the UN Human Rights Chief has warned that large-scale Israeli
*11:53.260- 12:00.900* :  ground operations in Gaza could have catastrophic consequences with possibly thousands more civilian
*12:00.900- 12:06.760* :  deaths. Volkotuk urged the two sides and others with influence in the region to do everything
*12:06.760- 12:12.640* :  possible to de-escalate the conflict. He deployed the consequences for civilians, especially
*12:12.640- 12:19.100* :  the stepping up of the bombardments on Friday night. Last night's bombardment and ground operations
*12:19.100- 12:27.100* :  were reportedly the most intensive yet, taking this terrible crisis to a new level of violence and
*12:27.100- 12:32.420* :  pain. Compounding the misery and suffering of civilians, Israeli strikes and telecommunications
*12:32.420- 12:39.320* :  installations and subsequent internet shutdown have effectively left Gaza with no way of knowing
*12:39.320- 12:46.220* :  what is happening across Gaza. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Burrell, said a pause in hostilities
*12:46.220- 12:52.980* :  was urgently needed to allow humanitarian access. Saudi Arabia condemned any Israeli ground
*12:52.980- 12:58.740* :  operations that threatened Palestinian lives. While pro-Palestinian rallies have been held in a
*12:58.740- 13:03.660* :  number of cities around the world from London and Paris to Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan.
*13:04.300- 13:09.280* :  Speaking at a huge demonstration in Istanbul, the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
*13:09.660- 13:15.240* :  repeated his stance that Hamas is not a terrorist organization and attacked the Israeli Prime
*13:15.240- 13:26.300* :  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu is a terrorist. Shame on you, Israel. We will
*13:26.300- 13:32.920* :  declare to the world that you are a war criminal. Right now, we are making preparations for this.
*13:33.740- 13:38.180* :  Our reporter Victoria Craig was at the rally. She told us more about this huge demonstration
*13:38.180- 13:43.040* :  in Istanbul. The initial numbers, at least according to the President's communications office,
*13:43.040- 13:49.260* :  is that 1.5 million people gathered here. The rally was held at a disused airport called
*13:49.260- 13:55.020* :  editor airport here in the commercial capital of the country. Lots of Palestinian and Turkish flags
*13:55.020- 13:59.520* :  were waving as the President took the stage. Lots of impassioned people here today,
*13:59.520- 14:04.440* :  really rallying around the Palestinian cause and what the President had to say.
*14:04.800- 14:08.260* :  Yeah, very emotional words from the President. What did people there say to you?
*14:08.660- 14:11.840* :  Yeah, I talked to a lot of people as they were sort of filtering in and as they say,
*14:11.840- 14:17.960* :  lots of different views from various people that we were speaking to. A lot of people have said
*14:17.960- 14:23.000* :  that they believe that Turkey will lead the region. They're very happy with President Erdogan's
*14:23.320- 14:28.580* :  stance. He's taken a really tough measure, tough talk over the last few weeks, especially as
*14:28.580- 14:33.960* :  the conflict has escalated. They criticized the rest of the Muslim world for not being tough
*14:34.000- 14:39.340* :  enough. And many said that they would actually support Turkey military action in response to the
*14:39.340- 14:43.740* :  crisis in Gaza, so you can hear from a few people that we've had it to on the street here.
*14:46.260- 14:50.640* :  Everyone who calls themselves human should have been here because what happens is not related
*14:50.640- 14:59.580* :  to a religion. It has a crime against humanity. We are in a stage where we will decide the fate
*14:59.580- 15:06.020* :  of humanity. Nothing like this can happen again in the future. So that was a view on the street,
*15:06.020- 15:12.380* :  but some people say somewhat surprising that President Erdogan has come out so strongly against
*15:12.400- 15:16.420* :  Israel, given that relations between Israel and Turkey had been improving recently.
*15:17.080- 15:22.540* :  Yes, indeed. And I think that is a growing concern among some in particularly the Western
*15:22.540- 15:27.680* :  diplomatic community that I've been speaking to over the last few weeks. They worry about this
*15:28.320- 15:33.240* :  really intense rhetoric that he's taken. He's criticized the West fairly strongly for its
*15:33.240- 15:38.580* :  support of Israel, particularly the United States. Here, the U.S. and Israel are viewed as
*15:38.760- 15:43.700* :  almost one in the same. I don't think that's too extreme to say. The U.S. really firmly backing
*15:43.700- 15:51.140* :  Israel. And so this all has a knock-on effect on Turkey, specifically, because as we've talked
*15:51.140- 15:55.740* :  a lot in the last couple of years, Turkey itself has been suffering from a very deep economic crisis.
*15:55.740- 16:01.160* :  Inflation here is above 60 percent. And the President, after he was reelected in May,
*16:01.160- 16:06.560* :  vowed really to make the economy his top priority. In the last few months, there had been positive
*16:06.560- 16:10.200* :  signs that investors were going to return to Turkey. And that was going to be a big part of
*16:10.200- 16:14.100* :  this recovery, but now there are concerns that this amped up rhetoric from the President,
*16:14.100- 16:19.040* :  in particular, may put those investors off. And of course, damage diplomatic relations between
*16:19.040- 16:24.900* :  the West and Turkey. And Israel as well, Turkey's President Erdogan had been on a path to more
*16:25.120- 16:29.680* :  normalized relations with Israel. And that seems to be solidly not the case anymore.
*16:30.560- 16:36.740* :  Victoria Craig. In London, tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through
*16:36.740- 16:41.200* :  the center of the capital, one of a number of protests which have taken place around the UK.
*16:41.860- 16:44.580* :  A home affairs correspondent Tom Simons has this report.
*16:48.720- 16:53.140* :  At one point, this protest stretched a mile and a half through the streets of London.
*16:53.680- 16:59.000* :  The protestors called for a ceasefire in Gaza. They criticised both Rishi Sunak and Sakeer
*16:59.000- 17:07.080* :  Stama for not demanding one. Before the protest, police were put under pressure by the government
*17:07.080- 17:11.980* :  to take a tough line against shouts or banners, which might breach terrorism laws.
*17:12.520- 17:17.500* :  Scotland Yard said there had been just one arrest in connection with racist remarks and a threat
*17:17.500- 17:22.600* :  to kill. Police did not respond to shouts of, from the river to the sea,
*17:22.600- 17:28.040* :  Palestine will be free, regarded by Jewish groups and Israel as a threat to its existence
*17:28.040- 17:31.580* :  and by the Home Secretary-Sweiler Bravaman as anti-Semitic.
*17:36.140- 17:41.940* :  Pro-Palestinian activists say it's a call for freedom from repression and not a threat.
*17:43.100- 17:49.080* :  Tom Simons, there have also been protests across the Middle East. He is our regional editor, Mike Thomson.
*17:49.800- 17:53.360* :  They don't come much bigger than the one that's been happening today in Istanbul.
*17:53.360- 17:59.720* :  Turkey's President Erdogan was speaking there and he accused Israel of behaving like a war criminal
*18:00.460- 18:05.140* :  and also blamed the West for constantly backing Israel without enough thought.
*18:05.300- 18:10.280* :  The protests have also extended right across the Middle East. The last 24 hours with the
*18:10.280- 18:16.580* :  protests in the West Bank in Amar in Jordan, about 200,000 people there, in the Yemeni capital
*18:16.580- 18:23.000* :  Sana'a, in Lebanon and Iraq as well. And as you said there, it is a global thing.
*18:23.280- 18:27.820* :  I mean, it goes right through to Indonesia, to Malaysia and then back of course to Europe,
*18:27.820- 18:34.460* :  London, Paris, Denmark and Tunisia. Mike Thomson, so what do the Israeli forces do next
*18:34.460- 18:40.220* :  as they continue their bombardment and ground operation in Gaza? General David Patreus
*18:40.220- 18:46.280* :  commanded NATO and US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and was a former director of the CIA.
*18:47.020- 18:52.500* :  He's also author of conflict, the evolution of warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.
*18:53.480- 18:58.460* :  Speaking just before the Israeli Prime Minister gave his TV address, General Patreus told my colleague,
*18:58.460- 19:02.960* :  Matthew Amolewala, what he thinks these ready forces are likely to do next.
*19:03.560- 19:08.820* :  This appears clearly to be a very substantial push by the Israelis. My sense is that they're seeking
*19:08.820- 19:14.900* :  to establish a lodgement, a foothold in the urban areas. They're using air attacks to set the
*19:14.900- 19:21.660* :  conditions, if you will, to attack any known Hamas headquarters, bases, logistical sites.
*19:21.960- 19:28.220* :  They've turned off the ability for them to communicate with mobile phones so that that restricts
*19:28.220- 19:33.100* :  their command and control capacity. Up until now, you could have a sense that what they were doing
*19:33.100- 19:39.420* :  was feeling the edges of Hamas, seeing how they would respond to a reconnaissance probe.
*19:40.060- 19:44.720* :  This appears to be the offensive, and I'd be surprised, given the magnitude of this,
*19:45.480- 19:50.260* :  if they would withdraw from this, rather I would suspect that they will again seize a foothold
*19:50.720- 19:55.780* :  and then commence what is going to be a very, very tough fight in which they will have to clear
*19:55.780- 20:01.980* :  every building, every floor, room, cell or tunnel, and then hold it. So you have to leave forces
*20:01.980- 20:07.880* :  behind before you can move on to the next one. That's the only way that you can destroy an enemy
*20:07.880- 20:13.040* :  like Hamas, a terrorist army, essentially, not reconcilable extremists who have, of course,
*20:13.040- 20:19.280* :  visited the worst, most terrific violence on the Israelis since the Holocaust.
*20:19.720- 20:25.220* :  I'll come to that fight and that battle and what it would be like because you have so much
*20:25.220- 20:31.200* :  experience in that whole area, but in terms of the next stages from what you were saying there
*20:31.200- 20:35.600* :  in your first answer, you think it only goes in one direction, which is to intensify.
*20:35.880- 20:40.540* :  I think that's right, and now the intensification will be the actual ground operations. Again,
*20:40.540- 20:46.260* :  the air operations have been to set the conditions so that when the first infantryman exposes
*20:46.260- 20:50.900* :  himself to the enemy, and eventually that will have to be the case. This is an enemy who doesn't
*20:50.900- 20:55.920* :  wear a uniform fights from within civilians, uses civilians as human shields. Of course,
*20:55.920- 21:02.880* :  there's over 200 hostages that are still in captivity as well. So the challenges of this could not
*21:02.880- 21:07.620* :  be more substantial. In fact, and in Roberts, again, my co-author in the book Conflict, and I look
*21:07.620- 21:15.260* :  back at all the cases that we looked at in the period since 1945, and we can't think of anything
*21:15.260- 21:20.960* :  that is comparable to the magnitude of the challenge in this particular case. Yes, we oversaw very
*21:20.960- 21:26.520* :  substantial urban operations during the surge in Iraq, particular when I was privileged to command
*21:26.520- 21:32.720* :  that, clear in major cities like Ramadi, Fallujah, Bakuba, Mosul, and parts of Baghdad. But none of
*21:32.720- 21:38.600* :  them presented as formidable a set of challenges as does this for the Israeli forces.
*21:39.020- 21:47.500* :  That is quite something to say that this possibly represents a challenge like no other in history
*21:47.500- 21:53.780* :  in terms of what you have recently looked at and actually experienced. What then are the
*21:53.780- 21:58.980* :  principle challenges here? What makes it so difficult potentially? Well, the challenge is that
*21:58.980- 22:03.660* :  the enemy, again, you're going to have to reveal yourself to have the enemy fire on you.
*22:03.820- 22:08.200* :  Some of the enemy may actually be willing to blow themselves up to take the Israelis with them.
*22:08.200- 22:14.360* :  Presumably, they've had months, if not years, to plan this, and if it is as creative, if you will,
*22:14.360- 22:20.340* :  in the horrific sense that that original attack on 10-7 was, then we can expect a very creative
*22:20.340- 22:25.560* :  defense who will have improvised explosive devices. Booby traps, rooms will blow up, buildings will
*22:25.560- 22:30.100* :  blow up. Again, they're not concerned about what they're doing to bring this violence on the
*22:30.300- 22:35.360* :  innocent Palestinians, civilians, and Gaza City. And it's going to be a very, very tough fight.
*22:35.360- 22:41.260* :  And then you add to that 300 miles of reinforced concrete tunnel underneath the city. And yes,
*22:41.260- 22:46.000* :  the Israelis have a problem. It's as extensive as that. It's 300 miles of these tunnels.
*22:46.000- 22:51.320* :  Yes. And again, Israelis have technology. They've developed a deal with some of this. It's
*22:51.320- 22:56.060* :  quite sophisticated. It's quite impressive. I think we'll start to see it unveiled over time.
*22:56.900- 23:02.000* :  But at the end of the day, this will inevitably end up in soldiers having to clear
*23:02.800- 23:07.320* :  buildings and clear rooms. And that is a very challenging endeavor, indeed.
*23:08.420- 23:09.980* :  General David Patreus.
*23:12.160- 23:18.260* :  Still to come. My Pence's campaign had been struggling virtually since it was launched back in June.
*23:18.300- 23:24.700* :  The former US Vice President, Mike Pence, has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential race.

*24:04.180- 24:09.780* :  Welcome back to the Global News podcast. Nearly a month after she was reportedly attacked by Iran's
*24:09.860- 24:15.060* :  so-called morality police for not covering her hair, a 16-year-old girl has died,
*24:15.060- 24:20.440* :  according to Iranian media. Amita Garavand had been in a coma since the reported
*24:20.440- 24:25.760* :  confrontation with police officers on the Tehran Metro. Her case has been compared to the death
*24:25.760- 24:32.020* :  of Masa Amini in police custody last September, which sparked months of widespread protests across
*24:32.020- 24:36.580* :  Iran. Cervash Ardlan of the BBC Persian Service gave us more details.
*24:37.380- 24:43.160* :  We know that 28 days ago she entered one of Tehran subway stations as she was boarding the train.
*24:43.160- 24:46.820* :  She fell back, she hit her head against the edge of the platform,
*24:46.820- 24:52.140* :  and then she was dragged out and then went into a coma. Subsequently, today she passed away.
*24:52.460- 24:56.000* :  But we don't exactly know what happened while she boarded the train.
*24:56.000- 25:00.600* :  Humor Rice campaigners say that she was confronted by a member of the morality police
*25:00.600- 25:06.640* :  who asked her to cover her hair. She refused, then that member of the police pushed her back,
*25:06.640- 25:11.560* :  and that's why she fell down. While the official version of events is that as soon as she
*25:11.560- 25:15.540* :  boarded her blood pressure fell, she became dizzy, and that's why she fell.
*25:15.760- 25:20.200* :  And the Iranian authorities will be very worried about the possible reaction to this,
*25:20.200- 25:25.280* :  possibly more protests like the ones we saw in the aftermath of Masa Amini's death last year.
*25:25.480- 25:30.500* :  It would be very unlikely that we would see a repeat of those protests, because really the
*25:30.500- 25:35.380* :  government reigned in with an iron fist. They executed seven people. They arrested tens of
*25:35.380- 25:41.460* :  thousands of people. So everyone's pretty much scared. But there is a funeral ceremony to
*25:41.460- 25:47.340* :  be held. The family is called for people to join in. And given the situation with Israel and Gaza,
*25:47.680- 25:52.700* :  perhaps the international pressure is off Iran, because it is a key player in that conflict,
*25:52.700- 25:56.980* :  because it is a big supporter of Hamas. It is. When you look at the social media, one of the
*25:56.980- 26:02.040* :  theories that people are putting forward is that she had already passed away a few days ago,
*26:02.040- 26:06.500* :  and the government held on to that news, and especially announced it today, as people are
*26:06.500- 26:12.000* :  all watching what's happening in Gaza, and their attention is elsewhere. So as to probably,
*26:12.580- 26:15.460* :  you know, avoid, you know, anger on resentment on the street.
*26:16.220- 26:21.900* :  Sir Vash Adlan, let's turn out to Bangladesh, where a huge anti-government rally by the main
*26:21.900- 26:28.860* :  opposition party in the country on Saturday ended in violent chaos. One police officer was killed
*26:28.860- 26:33.580* :  and more than a hundred people reportedly injured. Charles Haveland reports.
*26:34.560- 26:39.540* :  As activists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party poured into darker and chanted slogans against
*26:39.540- 26:44.580* :  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, street battles escalated, demonstrators threw bricks and stones,
*26:44.580- 26:49.320* :  police deployed stun grenades and tear gas, and dispersed the crowd, which the opposition
*26:49.320- 26:54.500* :  numbered at more than a million, but the police at one-tenth of that. The BNP has called for a
*26:54.500- 27:00.280* :  nationwide strike on Sunday in protest at Saturday's events. The party wants Sheikh Hasina to give
*27:00.280- 27:05.900* :  way to a neutral interim administration to oversee January's elections. She's been in power
*27:05.900- 27:12.060* :  15 years. Charles Haveland, the former US Vice President Mike Pence has dropped out of the race
*27:12.060- 27:17.780* :  to become the next president of the United States. He told supporters, this is not my time.
*27:17.780- 27:23.180* :  He'd hoped to win the Republican Party's nomination, but that contest is overwhelmingly
*27:23.180- 27:28.620* :  dominated by the former President Donald Trump. From Washington, here's David Willis.
*27:29.320- 27:34.080* :  Mike Pence's campaign had been struggling virtually since it was launched back in June,
*27:34.080- 27:39.880* :  and with only weeks to go, he remained well short of the polling and donor thresholds required
*27:39.880- 27:45.680* :  to qualify for his party's third presidential nomination debate. The former Indiana Governor,
*27:45.680- 27:51.380* :  who was a loyal Vice President to Donald Trump until the insurrection on the 6th of January,
*27:51.380- 27:57.680* :  caused them to drift apart, had tied his campaign to the conservative principles of Lincoln and Reagan,
*27:57.680- 28:03.860* :  but his voice was lost amongst a crowded field of candidates, all chasing the support of those
*28:03.860- 28:09.860* :  still loyal to Donald Trump. David Willis, police in the US state of Maine say there are still
*28:09.860- 28:16.700* :  questions about why a government killed 18 people in America's deadliest mass shooting so far this year.
*28:17.320- 28:22.220* :  Robert Card, an Army reservist, was found dead on Friday night after a three-day manhunt.
*28:22.640- 28:26.740* :  It's believed that he shot himself. On North America correspondent Nomiya Igbal,
*28:26.740- 28:32.040* :  sent this report from the city of Lewiston. Police have been giving more details about what they
*28:32.040- 28:37.740* :  describe as a very intensive manhunt. Divers were sent into the main river that runs through Maine
*28:37.740- 28:43.220* :  before Robert Card's body was found in the town of Lisbon near an area searched twice by police.
*28:44.060- 28:48.560* :  At a news conference, officials said a number of guns were found at the scene and there was a note at
*28:48.560- 28:53.480* :  Card's home. There were reports it was a suicide note, but they said it wasn't explicitly that,
*28:53.580- 28:57.980* :  it was addressed to a loved one with Card's phone, passcode and bank account numbers.
*28:58.800- 29:04.520* :  The names of the 18 victims have now been made public by police. They ranged from 14 to 76
*29:04.520- 29:10.620* :  years old with many from the deaf community. Police say Card legally bought his guns days before
*29:10.620- 29:15.020* :  the attack. However, he was also known to have undergone mental health evaluations.
*29:15.260- 29:19.620* :  Officials say they're still trying to find out whether specific gun laws in the state
*29:19.620- 29:26.540* :  designed to address unwell individuals were applied in this case. Nomiya Igbal, next to
*29:26.540- 29:32.020* :  sport and South Africa have made history at the Rugby World Cup beating New Zealand at a thrilling
*29:32.020- 29:37.400* :  final in Paris to win a record fourth title. The defending champions, the spring box,
*29:37.400- 29:45.520* :  held on to secure a narrow 12.211 victory at the stack to France. I heard more from Andy Barwell
*29:45.520- 29:50.820* :  from BBC Sport. It was a wet night in Paris, a match full of drama and tension,
*29:50.820- 29:55.820* :  and South Africa are the world champions again in Rugby Union. The spring box retained the trophy
*29:55.820- 30:01.440* :  with a narrow 12.11 victory over New Zealand when the beaten France by a point in the quarterfinals
*30:01.440- 30:06.040* :  that defeated England by a similar margin in the semi-finals and they did it again against the
*30:06.040- 30:11.100* :  all blacks in the final. No quarter was given in the game. The New Zealand skipper Sam came with
*30:11.100- 30:16.380* :  sent off for a head-on-head tackle in the first half. South Africa's captain, Cia Colisey,
*30:16.520- 30:20.680* :  was yellow carded and sent to the synbin for a head contact in the second period.
*30:21.040- 30:26.800* :  Martin Johnson is a World Cup winning skipper for England and he gave BBC Sport his thoughts on
*30:26.800- 30:31.140* :  those massive decisions. I really enjoyed the game because at times it was scrappy,
*30:32.040- 30:37.880* :  at times it was chaotic, it was brutally physical and it was a fantastic game of Rugby. It wasn't
*30:37.880- 30:43.300* :  like a polished game of Rugby but I will always go back to, unfortunately, in this game,
*30:44.300- 30:49.340* :  how you can say one guy, one accident was an accident and one accident is a red card.
*30:50.900- 30:56.000* :  Explain that to me. That's Martin Johnson. While it was Bowdoin Barrett who got 14 man
*30:56.000- 31:02.300* :  New Zealand back to just a single point deficit with a 58th minute try but the attempted conversion
*31:02.300- 31:08.000* :  was off target and that proved to be costly. The four penalties scored from the boot of South Africa's
*31:08.000- 31:13.120* :  Andre Pollard ultimately settled it for the spring box and that was their fourth Rugby
*31:13.120- 31:19.740* :  World Cup final success. Andy Barwell. Let's return to our top story now. Israel's ground
*31:19.740- 31:25.920* :  operation in Gaza. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his first priority
*31:25.920- 31:31.800* :  is to win the war against Hamas and his second is to bring home the hostages held in Gaza.
*31:32.620- 31:37.820* :  He insisted that there's no contradiction between the two objectives but destroying Hamas
*31:37.820- 31:43.680* :  had to come first. With his assessment here's our international editor Jeremy Bowen who's in
*31:43.680- 31:49.620* :  the Israeli town of Strasht close to Gaza. Israel says it's making the earth shake in Gaza.
*31:49.620- 31:57.000* :  It believes overwhelming power can restore its security but military force alone has never
*31:57.000- 32:04.000* :  brought lasting quiet let alone peace in this conflict's long history. Israel might be able to
*32:04.000- 32:11.620* :  destroy the Hamas military wing. If it succeeds it will also need a political strategy even a new
*32:11.620- 32:19.040* :  peace process for the days after. Well before that the war carries many risks for the region as well
*32:19.040- 32:24.940* :  as Israel and the Palestinians. The more Palestinians that Israel kills especially civilians
*32:25.020- 32:31.560* :  the greater the levels of anger and outrage in the Middle East among Israel's friends as well
*32:31.560- 32:39.480* :  as its enemies. That doesn't automatically mean the war will spread but it increases the volatility
*32:39.480- 32:45.920* :  and danger in a region that is already very fragile. Israel's ground war has started.
*32:46.640- 32:51.780* :  Continuing it here is now the biggest political and diplomatic challenge in the world.
*32:53.060- 32:53.720* :  Jeremy Bowen.
*32:56.100- 33:00.340* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
