*01:00.560- 01:04.600* :  We will be precise, sharp, fatal, but there will be a price.

*01:17.140- 01:20.900* :  The humanitarian corridor needs to be uninterrupted.
*01:21.080- 01:22.260* :  It needs to be predictable.
*01:22.260- 01:25.280* :  We will need at least 100 trucks a day.
*01:27.940- 01:28.820* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:28.820- 01:32.680* :  one of Donald Trump's lawyers pleads guilty to her role
*01:32.680- 01:36.560* :  in attempting to overturn the result of the 2020 election.

*01:39.400- 01:41.600* :  to avoid paying for restaurant meals
*01:42.040- 01:43.860* :  that he's landed up behind bars.
*01:47.860- 01:49.960* :  There are signs that Israel is readying itself
*01:49.960- 01:52.320* :  for a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.
*01:52.360- 01:54.880* :  Jordan has warned it fears the worst.
*01:55.340- 01:57.180* :  The Israeli Defence Minister told troops
*01:57.180- 01:59.740* :  on the border with Gaza that they will soon see
*01:59.740- 02:02.060* :  the Palestinian enclave from inside
*02:02.060- 02:05.480* :  while carrying out their objective to destroy Hamas
*02:05.860- 02:08.960* :  after gunmen from the group killed 1,400 Israelis
*02:09.400- 02:12.380* :  and took more than 200 hostages earlier this month.
*02:12.920- 02:14.900* :  The order will come, you have Galant said,
*02:14.900- 02:18.560* :  adding that Hamas had to be defeated, whatever the cost.
*02:21.100- 02:23.060* :  I'm responsible for the defence establishment.
*02:23.780- 02:26.760* :  I'm also responsible for leading it to victory in the battle.
*02:27.460- 02:28.860* :  The battle will be a tough one.
*02:29.340- 02:33.340* :  We will be precise, sharp, fatal, but there will be a price.
*02:34.040- 02:36.220* :  We will pay that price and we will continue
*02:36.220- 02:37.720* :  until we complete the mission.
*02:38.320- 02:42.260* :  Thursday saw another day of airstrikes by Israel on Gaza.
*02:42.820- 02:45.180* :  With more details, here's Paul Adams in Jerusalem.
*02:49.680- 02:51.900* :  Israel's relentless round the clock bombarmament
*02:51.900- 02:53.320* :  of the Gaza Strip goes on.
*02:53.800- 02:55.760* :  Apartment blocks in one of Gaza's cities
*02:55.760- 02:58.400* :  with more affluent neighbourhoods under attack today.
*02:59.060- 03:02.740* :  One local news agency said another senior Hamas military leader
*03:03.020- 03:05.540* :  had been killed, along with members of his family
*03:06.260- 03:06.860* :  elsewhere in the city.
*03:10.580- 03:13.760* :  Outside a hospital in Khan Unis in the southern Gaza Strip,
*03:14.140- 03:17.680* :  the chaotic, anguished aftermath of yet another airstrike.
*03:18.100- 03:20.700* :  The injured arriving in ambulances and pick-up trucks.
*03:21.300- 03:26.080* :  They were children, a man cries, all children.
*03:27.240- 03:30.300* :  For the overcrowded hospitals, this is already unbearable.
*03:34.600- 03:36.960* :  At the Kuwaiti Specialist Hospital in Rafa,
*03:37.260- 03:39.500* :  the only surgeon, Suhaib Al-Hams,
*03:39.960- 03:42.520* :  said they were receiving scores of dead and injured.
*03:43.040- 03:45.520* :  Gaza's health system, he said, was collapsing,
*03:45.520- 03:47.240* :  hospitals shutting down.
*03:47.240- 03:50.320* :  And Israel's widely anticipated ground invasion
*03:50.320- 03:51.600* :  has not even begun.
*03:52.320- 03:54.480* :  Visiting troops massing on the border today,
*03:54.540- 03:57.140* :  Israel's Defence Minister Yohav Galant
*03:57.500- 04:00.200* :  said they would soon see Gaza from inside.
*04:00.380- 04:02.720* :  The command he said would come.
*04:03.340- 04:05.760* :  Paul Adams, the British Prime Minister
*04:05.760- 04:09.000* :  Rishi Sunak spent the day in Israel and Saudi Arabia.
*04:09.520- 04:13.220* :  He told Benjamin Netanyahu that the UK would stand with Israel
*04:13.220- 04:15.480* :  in what he called its Dark Astair.
*04:16.140- 04:18.360* :  On Thursday night, Dining Street said the Prime Minister
*04:18.360- 04:21.080* :  and the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
*04:21.400- 04:24.060* :  had agreed on the need to avoid any further escalation
*04:24.220- 04:24.720* :  in the region.
*04:25.500- 04:28.580* :  With his assessment of what Mr Sunak is trying to achieve,
*04:28.580- 04:30.680* :  is our political editor, Chris Mason.
*04:31.260- 04:33.800* :  Showing physical solidarity with Israel
*04:33.800- 04:35.880* :  as it was put to me, turning up,
*04:36.460- 04:37.780* :  mattered to Dining Street.
*04:38.280- 04:41.820* :  Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged it mattered to Israel too.
*04:42.280- 04:45.680* :  The two men spoke for two hours, mostly tet-a-tet,
*04:46.180- 04:48.380* :  diplomatic jargon with a French twist
*04:48.580- 04:50.160* :  for when officials leave the room
*04:50.640- 04:52.980* :  and leave it to the leaders to talk one-on-one.
*04:53.580- 04:55.900* :  Dining Street said that Rishi Sunak used his meeting
*04:55.900- 04:58.200* :  with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
*04:58.640- 05:02.100* :  to urge him to use Saudi's leadership in the region
*05:02.100- 05:06.040* :  to support stability now and in the long term.
*05:06.680- 05:09.520* :  His role in potentially dampening the burning anger
*05:09.520- 05:12.520* :  on all sides is seen as crucial.
*05:13.380- 05:14.000* :  Chris Mason.
*05:14.880- 05:18.860* :  In Gaza, the health authorities say more than 3,400 people
*05:19.200- 05:20.600* :  have now died in the territory.
*05:21.120- 05:23.760* :  And for the 2.3 million civilians living there,
*05:24.140- 05:25.920* :  they are fast running out of everything,
*05:25.920- 05:28.480* :  food, medicine, water, and fuel.
*05:29.020- 05:31.720* :  As international pressure grows to allow aid in,
*05:31.720- 05:35.640* :  state media in Egypt is reporting that the Gaza border crossing
*05:35.640- 05:38.200* :  will be opened for several hours on Friday.
*05:38.920- 05:40.540* :  The head of the World Health Organization,
*05:40.540- 05:43.780* :  Tedros Adalam-Ghebriesses, says they are ready
*05:44.080- 05:44.500* :  and waiting.
*05:45.020- 05:47.320* :  We welcome Israel's announcement yesterday
*05:47.320- 05:50.460* :  that it will not block the entry of water, food,
*05:50.460- 05:52.520* :  and medicines into Gaza from Egypt.
*05:53.300- 05:57.440* :  Fuel is also needed for hospital generators, ambulances,
*05:58.120- 05:59.500* :  and desalination plants.
*06:00.140- 06:03.560* :  And we urge Israel to add fuel to the life-saving supplies
*06:03.560- 06:05.460* :  allowed to enter Gaza.
*06:06.280- 06:09.560* :  Our tracks are loaded and ready to go.
*06:10.400- 06:12.780* :  In Cairo, the United Nations Secretary-General
*06:12.780- 06:16.660* :  and Turner Guterresh called for rapid, unimpeded humanitarian
*06:16.660- 06:17.760* :  access to Gaza.
*06:18.380- 06:20.120* :  One of his officials, with responsibility
*06:20.120- 06:22.680* :  for Palestinian refugees, has been speaking
*06:22.680- 06:24.840* :  to our international editor, Jeremy Bohn.
*06:25.320- 06:28.700* :  Before this war, around 500 lorry loads of goods
*06:28.700- 06:30.260* :  came into Gaza every day.
*06:31.000- 06:34.060* :  President Biden talked about 20 trucks a day
*06:34.560- 06:38.380* :  when he persuaded Israel to allow aid shipments into Gaza
*06:38.380- 06:38.980* :  from Egypt.
*06:40.340- 06:42.980* :  Many more will be needed to make any dent
*06:42.980- 06:46.680* :  in the humanitarian disaster inside the Gaza Strip,
*06:47.340- 06:49.640* :  according to the UN Agency known as UNRWA,
*06:49.860- 06:51.900* :  which looks after Palestinian refugees.
*06:52.680- 06:55.400* :  Its Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, explained.
*06:56.080- 06:58.100* :  We are calling for an humanitarian corridor,
*06:58.540- 07:02.440* :  but the humanitarian corridor needs to be uninterrupted.
*07:02.640- 07:03.800* :  It needs to be predictable.
*07:03.800- 07:06.840* :  We will need at least 100 trucks a day.
*07:07.240- 07:09.920* :  If we cannot bring fuel, and we have
*07:09.920- 07:13.880* :  to bring the water in bottle, we will need much, much more.
*07:14.580- 07:17.140* :  I asked Mr. Lazzarini about Israel's decision
*07:17.140- 07:18.860* :  to put Gaza under siege.
*07:19.220- 07:21.740* :  This amounts to collective punishment,
*07:21.920- 07:24.820* :  and collective punishment is a violation
*07:24.820- 07:27.000* :  of international and humanitarian law.
*07:27.260- 07:30.460* :  Israel has gone through a traumatic event.
*07:30.460- 07:34.060* :  I condemn this barbaric massacre.
*07:34.580- 07:37.180* :  But this event still does not justify
*07:37.380- 07:42.540* :  that a war is conducted without any restraint.
*07:43.200- 07:46.680* :  Mr. Lazzarini repeated the UN Secretary-General's call
*07:46.680- 07:48.600* :  for a humanitarian ceasefire.
*07:49.080- 07:52.160* :  The Middle East, he said, was on the edge of an abyss.
*07:53.240- 07:53.980* :  Jeremy Bowen.
*07:54.640- 07:56.900* :  As Israel gears up for its ground offensive,
*07:57.280- 07:59.660* :  what will be the plight of more than 200 Israeli
*07:59.660- 08:03.060* :  and foreign hostages who are kidnapped during the Hamas attack
*08:03.460- 08:04.920* :  and are being held in Gaza?
*08:05.420- 08:08.140* :  There is anger not just about their precarious fate,
*08:08.140- 08:11.720* :  but also about the security failure on October 7th.
*08:12.120- 08:14.400* :  Some blame the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*08:14.760- 08:16.520* :  whose attempts to weaken the judiciary
*08:16.520- 08:20.660* :  in the face of corruption charges led to months of huge protests.
*08:21.480- 08:23.480* :  So can he survive politically?
*08:23.960- 08:27.700* :  Dan Johnson has been gauging opinion on the streets of Tel Aviv.
*08:28.440- 08:30.700* :  Let's go! Let's go!
*08:31.560- 08:33.440* :  On the pavement across from Israel,
*08:33.440- 08:35.260* :  defense forces, headquarters,
*08:35.900- 08:39.160* :  there are families camped here, essentially, in vigil,
*08:39.360- 08:41.180* :  calling for hostages to be released.
*08:41.180- 08:43.900* :  There are banners saying, bring our children home.
*08:44.280- 08:46.260* :  And one says, baby, resign now.
*08:46.660- 08:47.600* :  That's the Prime Minister.
*08:48.380- 08:52.180* :  An Ellie and Shira Alberg are waiting here for news
*08:52.520- 08:54.200* :  of the 18-year-old daughter, Liri,
*08:54.500- 08:55.940* :  who was last seen in a video
*08:56.460- 08:58.860* :  as she was being abducted and taken to Gaza.
*08:59.300- 09:00.700* :  Liri liked music.
*09:00.700- 09:02.020* :  She singled at the time.
*09:02.200- 09:03.240* :  She has a lot of friends.
*09:03.340- 09:05.700* :  She's 18 years old, but she's my little baby.
*09:05.700- 09:07.820* :  And I want her back. I want to hug her.
*09:07.980- 09:08.940* :  I want her back home.
*09:09.120- 09:11.860* :  Who do you hold responsible for not keeping her safe?
*09:12.060- 09:12.580* :  My country.
*09:13.320- 09:14.780* :  My country and all over the world,
*09:14.780- 09:18.200* :  because all the time we say Hamas is a terrorist organization.
*09:18.520- 09:19.220* :  Nobody listens.
*09:19.460- 09:22.360* :  War time often brings leaders more public support,
*09:22.540- 09:25.100* :  but opinion polls here are showing
*09:25.100- 09:27.600* :  that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*09:27.600- 09:30.900* :  baby's popularity has fallen considerably.
*09:30.900- 09:33.860* :  Shlomit Kubner hasn't heard from her friend,
*09:34.280- 09:35.480* :  Maiana Hirschkevitz,
*09:35.860- 09:39.640* :  since a text message was sent at 11.15 last Saturday,
*09:39.640- 09:41.460* :  saying she was hiding from attackers
*09:41.980- 09:44.820* :  and that the military still hadn't arrived to save them.
*09:45.180- 09:46.860* :  I want the general to look on my eyes,
*09:47.080- 09:48.100* :  see that we are in pain,
*09:48.480- 09:49.740* :  and they're responsible for it.
*09:49.880- 09:51.600* :  The general and Benjamin Netanyahu.
*09:51.860- 09:52.780* :  You think they should resign?
*09:53.480- 09:54.880* :  After. Now we need them.
*09:55.340- 09:56.340* :  And what about the Prime Minister?
*09:56.720- 10:00.340* :  I don't see any way he and his government can stay.
*10:00.340- 10:03.280* :  The pain is so bad, he won't be the Prime Minister.
*10:03.740- 10:07.380* :  Now these streets have echoed with unrest for much of this year
*10:07.780- 10:10.200* :  because of opposition to the Prime Minister's plans
*10:10.200- 10:13.440* :  to extend his own power and that of parliament
*10:13.440- 10:15.740* :  by removing some judicial oversight,
*10:15.740- 10:18.840* :  the checks and balances of Israel's supreme court.
*10:19.160- 10:21.920* :  At one point, there were thousands of volunteer servicemen
*10:21.920- 10:24.160* :  and women threatening to refuse to serve
*10:24.580- 10:27.600* :  because of the sense democracy was being undermined.
*10:27.800- 10:30.300* :  And that division still runs deep.
*10:30.480- 10:32.120* :  Baby, it's for our country.
*10:32.500- 10:36.200* :  The car's just drawn up here and a man shouted at the families
*10:36.200- 10:38.520* :  that this has all happened because there have been
*10:38.520- 10:40.780* :  so many protests here over the last few months.
*10:40.780- 10:42.820* :  There's a crowd gathering around the car now.
*10:42.820- 10:44.600* :  A woman is shouting at him.
*10:44.600- 10:48.100* :  She's clearly against baby Benjamin Netanyahu.
*10:48.100- 10:49.120* :  The police are getting involved.
*10:49.120- 10:50.360* :  More people gathering around.
*10:50.360- 10:52.420* :  He's doing it, baby, the king,
*10:52.420- 10:54.500* :  and baby, the best man in the world.
*10:54.500- 10:55.800* :  And I can't worry.
*10:56.460- 10:59.060* :  I wish to take baby instead of the children.
*10:59.520- 11:00.700* :  My name is Ada.
*11:00.900- 11:03.420* :  I'm here because I want to support the families.
*11:03.900- 11:05.340* :  It's not a strong government.
*11:05.520- 11:07.740* :  It just got weaker and weaker and weaker
*11:07.740- 11:09.420* :  and unable to do anything.
*11:09.420- 11:10.700* :  And we see that now.
*11:10.900- 11:14.540* :  And it's not only the last 10 months of demonstrations
*11:14.620- 11:15.900* :  and division.
*11:15.900- 11:18.480* :  It's years and years in the making.
*11:19.160- 11:21.940* :  Now the families, friends, and the supporters
*11:22.380- 11:25.320* :  are all regrouping together in prayer.
*11:26.300- 11:29.220* :  And this is an old Israeli song about guarding over the country
*11:29.700- 11:30.340* :  and its children.
*11:31.120- 11:33.660* :  Not many people want a change of leader right now,
*11:33.660- 11:34.540* :  not during a war.
*11:35.220- 11:38.260* :  But there is a strong sense that, after all this,
*11:38.760- 11:42.540* :  there will be serious calls for significant change.
*11:44.220- 11:44.860* :  Dan Johnson.
*11:46.020- 11:47.660* :  Now let's take you back to Wednesday
*11:47.660- 11:49.820* :  and that whirlwind trip to Israel
*11:49.820- 11:51.820* :  by the U.S. President Joe Biden.
*11:52.480- 11:53.540* :  When he stepped off the plane,
*11:53.540- 11:56.580* :  he was greeted warmly by Prime Minister Netanyahu
*11:57.020- 11:58.280* :  and both men embraced.
*11:58.880- 12:01.140* :  Later that day, during a speech in Tel Aviv,
*12:01.420- 12:04.140* :  Mr. Biden promised that the U.S. would ensure
*12:04.140- 12:07.180* :  Israel had what it needs to protect the country
*12:07.180- 12:08.580* :  and defend its people.
*12:09.220- 12:10.680* :  But he also pleaded with Israelis
*12:10.680- 12:14.280* :  not to allow anger to cloud crucial decision-making
*12:14.720- 12:15.620* :  in a time of war.
*12:16.360- 12:17.780* :  Justice must be done.
*12:18.140- 12:20.200* :  But I caution this while you feel that rage.
*12:20.920- 12:22.200* :  Don't be consumed by it.
*12:22.500- 12:25.540* :  After 9-11, we were enraged in the United States.
*12:26.240- 12:27.940* :  While we saw justice and got justice,
*12:27.940- 12:29.060* :  we also made mistakes.
*12:29.740- 12:31.800* :  I'm the first U.S. President to visit Israel
*12:32.300- 12:33.100* :  in time of war.
*12:33.660- 12:34.920* :  I've made wartime decisions.
*12:35.000- 12:37.480* :  I know the choices are never clear or easy
*12:37.480- 12:38.640* :  for a leadership.
*12:39.060- 12:40.020* :  There's always cost.
*12:40.420- 12:42.620* :  It requires asking very hard questions.
*12:43.300- 12:45.640* :  It requires clarity about the objectives
*12:46.340- 12:47.560* :  and an honest assessment
*12:48.020- 12:49.260* :  about whether the path you're on
*12:49.260- 12:50.440* :  will achieve those objectives.
*12:51.360- 12:53.160* :  Richard Hass is a senior member
*12:53.160- 12:55.120* :  of the U.S. foreign policy establishment.
*12:55.600- 12:57.380* :  He ran the council for foreign relations
*12:57.380- 13:01.600* :  and much of his career was devoted to crises in the Middle East.
*13:02.080- 13:03.480* :  Owen Bennett Jones asked him
*13:03.700- 13:05.500* :  whether Israel's stated objective
*13:05.500- 13:08.480* :  to destroy Hamas is even possible.
*13:08.700- 13:10.780* :  It's understandable, but I don't think it's possible.
*13:11.000- 13:12.360* :  I think the nature of Hamas,
*13:12.360- 13:14.700* :  it's as much a movement and ideology
*13:14.700- 13:16.360* :  as it is an organization.
*13:16.720- 13:19.260* :  Plus, almost a bar from Donald Rimsfeld.
*13:19.380- 13:21.460* :  I think the process of destroying it
*13:21.460- 13:23.760* :  will probably generate new recruits for it.
*13:23.860- 13:25.880* :  So I think a much smarter Israeli policy
*13:25.880- 13:28.000* :  would be to degrade it and to build up
*13:28.000- 13:29.760* :  much better defenses against it
*13:29.960- 13:31.160* :  rather than go on the errand
*13:31.160- 13:32.400* :  of trying to eliminate it.
*13:32.500- 13:33.920* :  I think what the president did was try
*13:33.920- 13:35.320* :  to thread the needle on his trip.
*13:35.760- 13:37.140* :  He very supportive of Israel.
*13:37.140- 13:38.980* :  On the other hand, I think what he was essentially
*13:38.980- 13:40.680* :  trying to do was temper their ambitions
*13:40.940- 13:41.920* :  and be cautionary.
*13:42.160- 13:44.300* :  The comparisons to 9-11, shall we say,
*13:44.300- 13:45.240* :  are not accidental.
*13:45.240- 13:48.580* :  United States in many ways overreached after 9-11,
*13:48.580- 13:50.800* :  creating as many problems as it's solved.
*13:50.800- 13:52.560* :  And I think that's what is essentially he was saying
*13:52.560- 13:54.900* :  to Israel, don't let your emotions here
*13:55.120- 13:55.800* :  run away from you.
*13:55.960- 13:57.340* :  So that is one set of issues.
*13:57.340- 13:59.640* :  You know, the immediate war objectives, if you like.
*13:59.780- 14:01.620* :  But I think some Arab government
*14:02.160- 14:02.860* :  that I think they're saying
*14:03.040- 14:04.580* :  there has to be a longer term solution.
*14:04.780- 14:06.640* :  Political solution to the Palestinian issue.
*14:06.640- 14:07.520* :  Do you think that's right?
*14:08.080- 14:08.300* :  Absolutely.
*14:08.320- 14:10.460* :  I don't think though Hamas is part of that
*14:10.460- 14:12.520* :  because any conceivable solution
*14:12.520- 14:14.660* :  involves peaceful coexistence with Israel.
*14:14.960- 14:16.280* :  So that rules Hamas out.
*14:16.320- 14:18.680* :  But obviously there are Palestinians now
*14:18.680- 14:20.940* :  and historically who have essentially
*14:20.940- 14:22.680* :  been willing to coexist with Israel.
*14:22.920- 14:23.320* :  And I agree.
*14:23.320- 14:25.940* :  I think it's necessary if this is ever going to be resolved.
*14:25.940- 14:28.160* :  But I don't think the moment's ripe for it.
*14:28.400- 14:30.340* :  I think what we have to do is first stabilize
*14:30.340- 14:33.040* :  the situation, let passions calm somewhat.
*14:33.040- 14:34.840* :  But I don't disagree with your point at all.
*14:35.000- 14:36.820* :  What you're saying is that you can even
*14:36.820- 14:38.740* :  start a process from the year or two.
*14:38.980- 14:40.600* :  Can you need a new Israeli government?
*14:40.600- 14:43.600* :  The previous government was posed to any concessions.
*14:43.600- 14:45.360* :  The current government is a war government.
*14:45.700- 14:47.360* :  So yes, you'd need a debate in Israel
*14:47.360- 14:48.820* :  and election, a new government.
*14:49.060- 14:51.300* :  I think on the Palestinian side, you've got a real problem.
*14:51.740- 14:53.520* :  Hamas, again, is ruled itself out.
*14:53.520- 14:55.620* :  And the West Bank really don't have a partner.
*14:55.740- 14:56.660* :  They're not strong enough.
*14:56.660- 14:58.540* :  It's not clear to me they have the capability.
*14:59.160- 15:00.580* :  So at Israel and the United States
*15:00.660- 15:02.840* :  are going to have to think about is how do they create
*15:02.840- 15:05.780* :  a context in which a Palestinian partner emerges?
*15:06.180- 15:07.940* :  So much of Israel's recent history
*15:07.940- 15:10.020* :  has been to undermine a Palestinian partner.
*15:10.160- 15:11.520* :  They've actually got a strengthen one
*15:11.520- 15:13.520* :  if negotiations have any chance of working.
*15:13.860- 15:15.220* :  Isn't there another difficulty, which
*15:15.220- 15:17.540* :  is that the established position of all the Western governments
*15:17.540- 15:18.660* :  to state solution?
*15:19.000- 15:21.520* :  Many people think is simply not possible now
*15:21.520- 15:23.300* :  because the number of settlements on the West Bank.
*15:23.620- 15:26.420* :  Showing answers now if I may paraphrase Winston Churchill.
*15:26.520- 15:29.100* :  The two-state solution is the worst possible approach
*15:29.100- 15:31.380* :  to the Palestinian issue except for all the others.
*15:31.540- 15:33.380* :  It's the only way I know to satisfy
*15:33.380- 15:35.620* :  some Palestinian political aspirations
*15:35.620- 15:39.220* :  and also for Israel to remain a democratic Jewish state.
*15:39.420- 15:41.020* :  Look, I don't underestimate the difficulties.
*15:41.020- 15:43.940* :  I've spent a lot of my career failing to succeed here,
*15:43.940- 15:45.340* :  though there were some, I think, examples
*15:45.340- 15:46.440* :  of important progress.
*15:46.620- 15:48.660* :  And yes, settlements will have to be rolled back
*15:48.660- 15:49.520* :  in certain areas.
*15:49.520- 15:50.700* :  They'll have to be contained.
*15:50.700- 15:52.020* :  That'll be part of the challenge.
*15:52.180- 15:53.360* :  They were rolled back in Egypt
*15:53.360- 15:55.360* :  when Israel made peace with Egypt.
*15:55.740- 15:56.900* :  So it's not unprecedented.
*15:56.900- 15:59.220* :  I'm not talking wholesale, but in selective areas
*15:59.260- 16:01.840* :  in order to create a viable Palestinian state
*16:01.840- 16:03.640* :  with contiguous territory, there
*16:03.640- 16:06.220* :  will have to be some movement of Israeli populations.
*16:06.220- 16:07.260* :  It's going to be painful.
*16:07.460- 16:08.940* :  And the only way you can say it is,
*16:08.940- 16:12.320* :  can you offset it with the advantages of a lasting peace?
*16:12.720- 16:16.100* :  Richard has speaking there to Owen Bennett Jones.
*16:18.780- 16:21.000* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast,
*16:21.340- 16:23.860* :  a Viermilay who, according to media reports,
*16:23.860- 16:25.400* :  talks to his dead dog,
*16:25.400- 16:28.520* :  came armed with a chainsaw at a rally in September
*16:29.000- 16:30.020* :  to convey a message.
*16:30.760- 16:33.440* :  Could this be the next president of Argentina?
*16:34.060- 16:35.920* :  We look ahead to Sunday's election.
*16:43.740- 16:46.940* :  In the days after the 2020 US presidential election,
*16:47.340- 16:49.220* :  Donald Trump was surrounded by a team
*16:49.220- 16:52.400* :  who publicly insisted that he had won the vote
*16:52.700- 16:54.380* :  and was being cheated out of victory.
*16:54.960- 16:57.400* :  19 people, including Mr. Trump himself,
*16:57.400- 16:59.080* :  have been charged with attempting
*16:59.080- 17:00.960* :  to overturn the election result.
*17:01.480- 17:03.780* :  On Thursday, one of the former president's lawyers,
*17:03.780- 17:06.760* :  Sidney Powell, pleaded guilty to her role.
*17:07.320- 17:08.640* :  And let's remind you of the type of things
*17:08.640- 17:10.840* :  she was claiming back in 2020.
*17:11.820- 17:14.060* :  What we are really dealing with here
*17:14.060- 17:16.020* :  and uncovering more by the day
*17:16.600- 17:20.920* :  is the massive influence of communist money
*17:21.500- 17:25.100* :  through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China
*17:25.580- 17:28.080* :  in the interference with our elections here
*17:28.080- 17:29.300* :  in the United States.
*17:29.940- 17:32.060* :  Anath America correspondent, Shanghai Nyoka,
*17:32.320- 17:33.400* :  has been following the case.
*17:33.920- 17:37.540* :  Well, what happens to Sidney Powell is that she stays out of jail.
*17:38.160- 17:40.860* :  She was able to negotiate a plea deal
*17:40.860- 17:42.420* :  after she pleaded guilty.
*17:42.960- 17:46.300* :  And she was sentenced to six years' probation
*17:46.780- 17:48.420* :  a year for each of the convictions
*17:48.420- 17:49.900* :  that she was convicted of.
*17:50.220- 17:52.940* :  She pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor charges.
*17:53.520- 17:57.020* :  And that was a day before her criminal trial was due to begin.
*17:57.100- 18:01.100* :  She also was fined $9,700 US dollars.
*18:01.500- 18:02.940* :  But I think more importantly,
*18:02.940- 18:07.140* :  for former president Donald Trump is that she has agreed
*18:07.140- 18:09.680* :  to testify not just against him,
*18:09.720- 18:12.360* :  but also against anyone else that she is called up
*18:12.360- 18:13.440* :  to testify against.
*18:13.500- 18:16.700* :  But I think she's probably breathing a sigh of relief this evening.
*18:17.100- 18:19.960* :  So 17 co-defendants, who are they apart
*18:19.960- 18:22.260* :  from other former president, Donald Trump?
*18:22.660- 18:27.140* :  Well, the other key co-defendant is Donald Trump's former lawyer,
*18:27.140- 18:29.080* :  personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
*18:29.520- 18:33.220* :  Some of the others include other lawyers, campaign managers,
*18:33.220- 18:35.380* :  as well as his former chief of staff.
*18:35.380- 18:40.460* :  So very senior members of his election campaign in 2020.
*18:41.200- 18:44.800* :  And what's been reaction to this in the United States?
*18:45.440- 18:48.660* :  There was a lot of surprise, as you heard from the clip there,
*18:48.680- 18:51.820* :  she was a really staunch supporter of Donald Trump
*18:52.280- 18:55.420* :  and of the fact that he had won these elections.
*18:55.420- 18:56.860* :  That's what she said.
*18:57.280- 18:59.660* :  Even though I think a lot of these conspiracy theories
*18:59.660- 19:03.740* :  have been debunked for Donald Trump, he hasn't responded to that.
*19:03.800- 19:06.940* :  But I think he will probably be very afraid now.
*19:06.940- 19:10.640* :  She was one of the key members of his team, one of his former lawyers.
*19:11.120- 19:13.620* :  And now she might testify against him in addition
*19:13.620- 19:17.900* :  to handing over those documents that she has relating to this case.
*19:18.280- 19:20.340* :  And what impact do you think that will have on him
*19:20.340- 19:22.620* :  considering he's running for the presidency?
*19:23.140- 19:26.680* :  Well, I think this is one of the key cases against him.
*19:26.680- 19:30.760* :  He faces four criminal cases, two federal and two at state level.
*19:31.140- 19:33.440* :  And this is one of the ones at the state level.
*19:33.840- 19:37.360* :  And if he is found guilty, he will not be able to pardon himself
*19:37.360- 19:38.640* :  if he becomes president.
*19:38.660- 19:40.820* :  And I think according to Georgia law,
*19:40.820- 19:43.160* :  even if he's found guilty, he will have to serve
*19:43.460- 19:46.040* :  a minimum mandatory sentence of a few years
*19:46.500- 19:48.340* :  before he's eligible for pardon.
*19:48.340- 19:52.060* :  And so this is really one of the more serious cases against Donald Trump.
*19:52.740- 19:53.460* :  Shanghai Nyeoka.
*19:54.260- 19:58.100* :  Now to report that the heads of one of China's top property companies
*19:58.360- 20:01.000* :  have fled the country, as the company faces losses
*20:01.000- 20:02.580* :  reminding to billions of dollars.
*20:03.340- 20:07.580* :  Country Garden, which failed to make a $15 million debt repayment
*20:07.580- 20:11.480* :  due on Tuesday, has denied the pair have left the country
*20:11.480- 20:13.280* :  and say they're working as usual.
*20:13.900- 20:18.060* :  Our correspondent, Mara Fogarty, in Singapore, told Gareth Barlow more.
*20:18.520- 20:20.900* :  The company, a country garden, put out a statement
*20:20.900- 20:23.700* :  on its official social media accounts within China,
*20:24.260- 20:27.180* :  denying that both the founder and the founder's daughter,
*20:27.180- 20:29.000* :  who is the current chairwoman of the company,
*20:29.000- 20:29.960* :  have fled the country.
*20:30.480- 20:33.120* :  They said that both of them are still in China.
*20:33.120- 20:36.460* :  They're still working, and that the rumor had caused a bad impact.
*20:36.460- 20:38.300* :  I'm kind of paraphrasing her a little bit.
*20:38.320- 20:39.320* :  So they're denying these reports.
*20:39.320- 20:41.860* :  And the reason why they're jittery about it is because
*20:41.860- 20:46.060* :  don't forget the founder of the rival company, Evergrande,
*20:46.380- 20:48.420* :  is now currently under police surveillance
*20:48.420- 20:51.320* :  after Evergrande declared bankruptcy a couple years ago.
*20:51.900- 20:53.720* :  China's property sector is in crisis.
*20:53.720- 20:56.820* :  And China's property sector is vitally important
*20:56.820- 20:57.820* :  for the wider economy.
*20:58.300- 21:00.560* :  Yeah, in the Chinese economy, property market
*21:00.560- 21:05.460* :  makes up about a third of the entire national economic product.
*21:05.460- 21:07.140* :  That's the GDP of the economy, right?
*21:07.400- 21:08.240* :  So property is huge.
*21:08.740- 21:11.400* :  And in China, many people have invested their life savings,
*21:11.400- 21:13.680* :  not just to buy a home to live in,
*21:14.040- 21:15.680* :  but for investment purposes.
*21:15.680- 21:18.560* :  And they've done it in a period where property prices
*21:18.560- 21:20.460* :  kept going up and up and up.
*21:20.460- 21:22.740* :  And as we all know, that's unsustainable
*21:22.780- 21:24.020* :  and that's what exactly has happened.
*21:24.580- 21:26.680* :  Now, the government has made it pretty clear
*21:26.680- 21:28.460* :  that they don't want to encourage
*21:28.460- 21:30.300* :  any more of this property bubble.
*21:30.300- 21:34.260* :  They want to unwind a lot of the debt or the loans
*21:34.260- 21:36.300* :  that have been in the property sector.
*21:36.300- 21:38.100* :  And they want to get it back to healthier levels.
*21:38.620- 21:41.860* :  It will take a while and it will cause some pain
*21:41.860- 21:44.700* :  to some companies and people in the process.
*21:45.300- 21:48.000* :  What impact is this crisis having on the wider economy?
*21:48.780- 21:50.300* :  So if you think about it, the property sector
*21:50.300- 21:53.120* :  is not just the construction companies or the developers.
*21:53.120- 21:56.520* :  It's the people who supply the workers, for example,
*21:56.540- 21:58.320* :  or the people who do the renovations
*21:58.340- 21:59.740* :  or the people who sell the paints
*21:59.740- 22:01.200* :  or make the glass for the windows.
*22:01.880- 22:05.280* :  So there is a knock on effect onto the wider economy
*22:05.280- 22:07.080* :  in not just the big companies,
*22:07.080- 22:09.000* :  but the smaller companies as well.
*22:09.280- 22:11.400* :  And don't forget, you know, for the last 20, 30 years,
*22:11.400- 22:13.780* :  China has been encouraging private enterprise
*22:13.840- 22:15.280* :  people to set up their own businesses
*22:15.840- 22:18.080* :  to go about servicing the economy in many ways.
*22:18.580- 22:21.160* :  And so the worry here is that that knock on effect
*22:21.160- 22:25.200* :  is going to spiral and seep out into the wider economy.
*22:25.940- 22:26.720* :  Morafogity.
*22:27.680- 22:30.180* :  In Argentina, people go to the polls on Sunday
*22:30.180- 22:32.580* :  to vote for a new president, who they hope
*22:32.600- 22:34.140* :  will be able to lead them out of what
*22:34.140- 22:37.000* :  seems to be a never-ending economic crisis.
*22:37.680- 22:39.840* :  The candidates of the traditional left and right
*22:39.840- 22:43.280* :  are facing a new challenger, a right-wing libertarian
*22:43.280- 22:46.280* :  economist, Gracie Twig, from BBC Monitoring Reports
*22:46.280- 22:49.300* :  Now, on the race and the appeal of the newcomer
*22:49.560- 22:51.900* :  challenging the established political order.
*22:52.500- 22:54.780* :  Until the primaries in August, the expectation
*22:54.780- 22:57.080* :  was that the main presidential contenders
*22:57.080- 23:00.320* :  would be representatives of each side of La Grietta,
*23:00.640- 23:03.320* :  or the left-right rift in Argentinian politics.
*23:04.180- 23:06.360* :  But the primaries, considered to be a barometer
*23:06.360- 23:09.320* :  for the mood of the nation, served up a surprise.
*23:09.840- 23:13.060* :  An outsider, with unruly hair and radical ideas,
*23:13.540- 23:14.580* :  took the poll position.
*23:15.900- 23:18.380* :  Hadir Milay, who, according to media reports,
*23:18.380- 23:22.040* :  talks to his dead dog, came armed with a chainsaw
*23:22.080- 23:24.820* :  at a rally in September to convey a message.
*23:25.300- 23:27.320* :  He says that he's going to cut down
*23:27.360- 23:30.480* :  the expenditure of the state by a lot.
*23:30.780- 23:34.020* :  Camilo Gomez has been watching the race for BBC Monitoring
*23:34.020- 23:35.280* :  slut in America team.
*23:37.940- 23:39.860* :  He shouts the cast trembles.
*23:40.040- 23:42.200* :  The cast is the term that he uses to refer
*23:42.200- 23:43.780* :  to the mainstream politicians.
*23:44.140- 23:47.300* :  Hadir Milay is seen as another example of a politician
*23:47.300- 23:50.740* :  riding the global wave of anti-establishment populism.
*23:51.400- 23:54.080* :  This is Luis Fajardo, also a Latin American media
*23:54.080- 23:55.900* :  analyst with BBC Monitoring.
*23:56.220- 23:58.860* :  It's a worldwide situation where many politicians
*23:58.860- 24:01.340* :  are promising to make their country great again.
*24:01.720- 24:05.260* :  In Argentina, this has a particularly strong resonance
*24:05.260- 24:07.100* :  because Argentina, a century ago,
*24:07.100- 24:09.140* :  was basically one of the economic powers of the world.
*24:09.140- 24:10.980* :  It was a very wealthy society,
*24:11.280- 24:13.700* :  and they have experienced a strong national decline
*24:13.700- 24:14.640* :  in economic terms.
*24:14.860- 24:18.560* :  Argentina's economy is at its most fragile in two decades.
*24:19.220- 24:21.320* :  It's the biggest debtor of the IMF.
*24:21.520- 24:23.140* :  Inflation is in triple digits.
*24:23.780- 24:25.200* :  People are getting poorer.
*24:25.840- 24:28.620* :  There are five candidates volunteering to fix this.
*24:29.160- 24:31.360* :  The state of the economy presents a challenge
*24:31.360- 24:34.420* :  for candidates with first-hand experience in governance,
*24:35.000- 24:37.180* :  like the economy minister Sergio Masa,
*24:37.240- 24:39.620* :  who's from the current left-wing ruling coalition.
*24:41.740- 24:44.080* :  The thing with Masa is that he's working a fine line
*24:44.080- 24:46.120* :  as a candidate and as a minister.
*24:46.300- 24:49.980* :  He has received a lot of criticism from the other candidates
*24:49.980- 24:52.000* :  who say his economy minister,
*24:52.000- 24:53.960* :  but the economy is not doing well.
*24:54.440- 24:56.500* :  Inflation has gone up,
*24:56.780- 24:59.400* :  and he says, I've been minister for one year,
*24:59.400- 25:02.980* :  and I took the job when nobody else wanted to be in charge.
*25:03.280- 25:05.900* :  Masa's proposals to generate economic growth
*25:05.900- 25:08.520* :  go hand in hand with his social policies.
*25:09.380- 25:11.660* :  The other main contender, Patricia Bullrich,
*25:11.660- 25:14.760* :  sometimes called in the media Argentina's Iron Lady,
*25:15.160- 25:17.520* :  is seen as a classic conservative candidate.
*25:19.920- 25:21.420* :  She stands for the status quo.
*25:21.420- 25:24.840* :  She has defended orthodox positions in managing the economy.
*25:24.840- 25:27.660* :  She is from a very aristocratic family in Argentina.
*25:28.220- 25:30.540* :  She moved in very leftist circles
*25:30.540- 25:33.760* :  that changed radically as her political career evolved
*25:33.760- 25:36.480* :  during the last conservative administration in Argentina.
*25:36.480- 25:39.460* :  She was seen as a hard-line law-and-order person.
*25:41.860- 25:44.620* :  She proposes to relax current restrictions
*25:44.620- 25:46.220* :  on the dollar in Argentina
*25:46.680- 25:49.100* :  so that the U.S. currency can circulate freely.
*25:49.100- 25:52.440* :  She has referred to this as bi-monitorism.
*25:52.520- 25:55.580* :  She also says she wants a state austerity.
*25:55.780- 25:57.580* :  The newcomer, Javier Millei,
*25:57.580- 26:01.440* :  is offering a radical reset of the economy and the state.
*26:01.900- 26:05.460* :  He really emphasizes on the unprecedented nature
*26:05.460- 26:06.520* :  of the things he's proposing.
*26:06.520- 26:09.960* :  He says he wants to dynamite the central bank of the country
*26:10.580- 26:13.600* :  to allow free market in an extreme version.
*26:13.600- 26:17.720* :  He says that he plans to get rid of the Argentine peso
*26:18.180- 26:19.560* :  and dollarize the economy.
*26:19.560- 26:22.440* :  That is a way in which he says that he will control inflation.
*26:25.040- 26:27.280* :  This is a video from Millei's TikTok account
*26:27.340- 26:30.340* :  where he tears off labels of various ministries
*26:30.340- 26:31.820* :  attached to a whiteboard.
*26:32.440- 26:35.100* :  It's his promise to reduce the size of the state.
*26:35.940- 26:39.100* :  But despite criticism that his plans would cause more pain
*26:39.100- 26:39.940* :  for the poorest,
*26:40.500- 26:42.220* :  he seems to be popular among them,
*26:42.620- 26:44.840* :  while causing alarm in other quotas.
*26:45.060- 26:46.660* :  Alarm would be an understatement.
*26:46.880- 26:50.820* :  The more intellectually-oriented sections of Argentinian media
*26:50.820- 26:54.400* :  say they are absolutely horrified with a person like Millei,
*26:54.720- 26:56.340* :  even getting close to the post.
*26:56.860- 26:59.820* :  Millei would say that this only reflects the disconnect
*26:59.820- 27:03.300* :  between these people and many Argentinians
*27:03.300- 27:05.100* :  who clearly find this idea as attractive.
*27:05.620- 27:08.960* :  Luis Fajardo ending that report from a crashy twig.
*27:09.420- 27:12.580* :  And you can hear more about the Argentine presidential race
*27:12.940- 27:14.900* :  in the BBC Monitoring's podcast.
*27:14.900- 27:19.100* :  Just search the global jigsaw wherever you get your podcasts.
*27:20.720- 27:23.120* :  In the Indian state of Gujarat, four police officers
*27:23.120- 27:26.980* :  have been sentenced to 14 days in prison for contempt of court.
*27:27.400- 27:30.240* :  It's linked to a case where Muslim men were publicly
*27:30.460- 27:32.120* :  flogged in October last year.
*27:32.640- 27:35.400* :  I asked I was South Asia-Edgar and Barassan Etharajan
*27:35.680- 27:36.860* :  about the background to the case.
*27:37.420- 27:40.240* :  There was a Hindu festival around this time
*27:40.240- 27:42.680* :  last year in the state of Gujarat.
*27:42.720- 27:45.220* :  And then the troubles started and both sides
*27:45.220- 27:48.520* :  accused each other of provoking this violence
*27:48.560- 27:50.080* :  between Hindus and Muslims.
*27:50.400- 27:52.600* :  And then the police said intervened
*27:52.600- 27:54.280* :  and they tried to restore order.
*27:54.940- 27:57.820* :  And during that, they arrested a number of people,
*27:57.820- 27:59.160* :  particularly Muslim men.
*27:59.320- 28:02.460* :  They were a keystaff pelting stones at this Hindu festival.
*28:02.520- 28:05.620* :  And they were brought to this village center
*28:05.620- 28:07.740* :  where they were tied to a pole.
*28:08.280- 28:11.420* :  And the videos emerged showing this around that time.
*28:12.020- 28:15.440* :  And they were publicly beaten with a bamboo stick
*28:15.440- 28:17.320* :  and the entire village watched.
*28:17.960- 28:20.560* :  And this triggered widespread anger in India.
*28:20.720- 28:24.820* :  And how police officers who are supposed to follow certain rules
*28:25.520- 28:27.540* :  can take law into their own hands.
*28:28.000- 28:30.740* :  Why have they been sent prison for contempt of court?
*28:31.300- 28:33.740* :  Because the courts, they have given certain guidelines
*28:33.740- 28:36.500* :  about how those arrested or taken into custody
*28:36.500- 28:37.460* :  should be treated.
*28:37.460- 28:40.000* :  And there should not be any public display
*28:40.000- 28:41.820* :  of any violence against anyone.
*28:42.420- 28:45.160* :  And that is why the contempt of court charges were brought
*28:45.160- 28:45.520* :  against.
*28:45.520- 28:48.400* :  What it shows is it is the broader issue
*28:48.400- 28:51.820* :  of about the treatment of religious minorities in India.
*28:52.040- 28:54.620* :  It's all about how the spread has increased
*28:54.620- 28:57.480* :  since the Hindu nationalist BJP government
*28:57.480- 29:02.300* :  came into power in 2014 with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi
*29:02.300- 29:03.100* :  coming to power.
*29:03.780- 29:06.920* :  And Barusan Evarajan, a man in Spain
*29:06.920- 29:10.440* :  is going to prison for repeatedly faking a heart attack
*29:10.440- 29:12.880* :  to get out of paying for restaurant meals.
*29:13.380- 29:16.000* :  The 50-year-old man, who's originally from Lithuania,
*29:16.380- 29:18.740* :  was arrested 20 times in the last year.
*29:19.260- 29:20.080* :  Phoebe Hobson reports.
*29:20.800- 29:23.680* :  We've all gasped at the bill, but faking a heart attack
*29:23.680- 29:26.880* :  to get out of paying for a meal is perhaps melodramatic.
*29:27.580- 29:30.200* :  But that's what an unnamed Lithuanian man in Spain
*29:30.200- 29:33.780* :  did on multiple occasions into his con-act wore thin.
*29:33.940- 29:36.540* :  He became known to the police, and they then
*29:36.540- 29:39.320* :  circulated his photo around the city of Alicante,
*29:39.700- 29:40.900* :  where he liked to dine.
*29:41.360- 29:44.260* :  He was arrested 20 times, but that didn't stop him
*29:44.260- 29:45.480* :  trying one more time.
*29:45.980- 29:47.840* :  According to the owner of the last restaurant,
*29:47.840- 29:49.800* :  he entered dressed in smart clothes,
*29:50.320- 29:53.140* :  ordered a seafood paella and two alcoholic drinks.
*29:53.840- 29:55.840* :  The total bill came to nearly $40,
*29:56.560- 29:58.580* :  and to avoid paying, he clutched his chest
*29:58.960- 30:00.320* :  and threw himself on the floor.
*30:00.940- 30:04.420* :  Despite two hours of acting, the restaurant recognized him
*30:04.720- 30:05.800* :  and alerted the police.
*30:06.720- 30:07.440* :  Phoebe Hobson.
*30:08.300- 30:10.380* :  And let's return to our top story.
*30:11.160- 30:13.440* :  Almost two weeks after the Hamas attack,
*30:13.440- 30:16.220* :  there are signs that Israel's ground offensive
*30:16.220- 30:18.420* :  in the Gaza Strip is imminent.
*30:18.980- 30:22.140* :  But there are growing concerns that the conflict could escalate
*30:22.440- 30:23.900* :  and spread across the region.
*30:24.480- 30:26.500* :  Our international editor, Joey Boen,
*30:26.740- 30:28.340* :  has sent us this update.
*30:28.780- 30:32.740* :  The Americans have said that one of their ships in the Red Sea
*30:33.040- 30:36.960* :  has shot down a number of cruise missiles or drones
*30:36.960- 30:40.500* :  that may have been heading for targets in Israel
*30:40.940- 30:43.100* :  that had been fired out of Yemen,
*30:43.680- 30:47.140* :  the Houthis who control large parts of the country,
*30:47.740- 30:51.580* :  having an alliance with Iran, Iran has advanced technology
*30:51.580- 30:53.300* :  for drones and cruise missiles.
*30:53.300- 30:55.120* :  So you can see a connection there.
*30:55.660- 30:58.100* :  There's been more trouble up on the border with Lebanon
*30:58.680- 30:59.340* :  in the north.
*30:59.580- 31:01.420* :  I've seen reports in Israel tonight,
*31:01.420- 31:02.920* :  which I can't personally confirm,
*31:02.920- 31:07.300* :  saying that the Israelis may have killed up to three fighters
*31:07.300- 31:11.020* :  from his Bollah who had been trying to fire into Israel.
*31:11.500- 31:12.480* :  And on the West Bank,
