*00:31.140- 00:33.900* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:35.880- 00:37.980* :  I'm Nick Mars and in the early hours of Saturday,
*00:37.980- 00:40.500* :  the 21st of October, these are our main stories.
*00:41.180- 00:45.740* :  An American mother and daughter have become the first hostages to be freed by Hamas
*00:45.740- 00:51.020* :  out of the 200 or so seas during the Islamist bloody attacks inside Israel.
*00:51.260- 00:55.800* :  With Israel still pounding Gaza, the Palestinian Red Crescent says
*00:55.800- 00:58.900* :  Israeli forces have ordered the evacuation of a hospital,
*00:59.360- 01:02.560* :  said to be sheltering more than 2,000 displaced civilians.
*01:03.460- 01:08.220* :  In other news, a third close associate of Donald Trump has pleaded guilty
*01:08.220- 01:12.560* :  to taking part in attempts to falsify the 2020 election results.
*01:14.920- 01:15.820* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:15.880- 01:18.740* :  It's fashionable to admire the opera house,
*01:18.840- 01:21.060* :  built to epitomise the old sailing ships.
*01:21.380- 01:23.540* :  It's an architects' dream and a challenge in curves
*01:23.540- 01:26.600* :  to the straight glass and steel structures that now make the skyline.
*01:27.560- 01:30.960* :  The Sydney Opera House, one of the most famous buildings in the world,
*01:30.960- 01:33.460* :  celebrates its fifth-deaf birthday.
*01:36.580- 01:41.920* :  The US President Joe Biden says he's overjoyed at the release of two American hostages
*01:42.220- 01:43.400* :  being held in Gaza.
*01:44.080- 01:48.600* :  Mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Rahnon have been reunited with family members
*01:48.600- 01:51.340* :  and returned to a military base in Israel.
*01:51.740- 01:54.880* :  They were among the 200 or so people abducted by Hamas
*01:55.400- 01:58.300* :  during the raids on southern Israel two weeks ago.
*01:58.700- 02:03.000* :  Hamas designated as a terror organisation by many Western governments,
*02:03.060- 02:08.600* :  including the UK, who said the two hostages were freed for humanitarian reasons.
*02:08.660- 02:11.400* :  Here's the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken.
*02:11.980- 02:17.040* :  There are still 10 additional Americans who remain unaccounted for in this conflict.
*02:18.060- 02:20.880* :  We know that some of them are being held hostage by Hamas,
*02:21.340- 02:24.960* :  along with an estimated 200 other hostages held in Gaza.
*02:26.620- 02:32.920* :  They include men, women, young boys, young girls, elderly people,
*02:34.240- 02:35.340* :  from many nations.
*02:36.780- 02:39.200* :  Every single one of them should be released.
*02:40.300- 02:42.900* :  I spoke to our correspondent Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem,
*02:42.900- 02:45.780* :  and asked him how did these releases come about?
*02:46.420- 02:50.760* :  The first thing we heard was a post on social media from Hamas itself,
*02:51.300- 02:57.420* :  Hamas spokesman saying that the release was coming of two American women,
*02:57.420- 03:01.800* :  a mother and daughter, and it said that that was happening for humanitarian reasons.
*03:01.860- 03:05.540* :  There was a flurry of excitement and speculation immediately after that,
*03:05.540- 03:09.480* :  and eventually Israel confirmed that, indeed, Judith and Natalie Rahnon
*03:09.480- 03:13.980* :  had been handed over to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross
*03:13.980- 03:15.700* :  and then delivered to Israel.
*03:15.700- 03:18.800* :  They were taken to a military base somewhere in the centre of the country,
*03:19.500- 03:24.060* :  and a photo emerged a bit later on of the two women walking with Israeli soldiers,
*03:24.620- 03:28.560* :  looking drawn and exhausted, but seemingly unharmed.
*03:28.980- 03:30.940* :  And what's the reaction from Israel being so far?
*03:32.460- 03:35.700* :  Well, obviously, this is the first bit of genuinely good news
*03:36.280- 03:41.120* :  that Israelis have experienced in the last two unbelievably bleak weeks,
*03:41.780- 03:44.460* :  so there was a great sense of excitement.
*03:45.300- 03:48.740* :  Again, not much in the way of an explanation as to how this came about,
*03:48.740- 03:52.260* :  but there was a little bit of insight in the words of Mark Reggae,
*03:52.260- 03:55.820* :  a senior adviser to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*03:55.820- 03:59.420* :  who said that this was basically the result of force and diplomacy.
*03:59.780- 04:02.280* :  I think Hamas understands its under amazing pressure,
*04:03.100- 04:05.620* :  both diplomatic and, of course, Israeli military might.
*04:05.620- 04:10.980* :  And I think that's forcing Hamas to try to do things and including release hostages.
*04:11.580- 04:12.700* :  We will keep the pressure up.
*04:12.900- 04:15.860* :  We think that is the best way to get more people out.
*04:16.060- 04:19.640* :  So Paul, Mr. Reggae, they're suggesting that it was pressure on Hamas
*04:19.760- 04:21.360* :  that led to these releases.
*04:22.180- 04:27.720* :  What impact, if any, might this have on Israel's preparation for a land invasion of Gaza,
*04:28.360- 04:30.460* :  or allowing aid in to Gaza?
*04:31.080- 04:33.680* :  I think the aid situation is a separate one,
*04:33.680- 04:39.080* :  although some people are speculating tonight that maybe the release of hostages could unlock
*04:39.080- 04:45.500* :  that aid convoy that's been sitting there on the Egyptian side of the border waiting to go in.
*04:45.720- 04:47.240* :  And delayed today.
*04:48.000- 04:52.800* :  But I think, you know, clearly, the whole hostage situation is a massive complication
*04:53.260- 04:58.220* :  in terms of Israel's overall objective, which is to go into Gaza and deal with Hamas,
*04:58.640- 05:01.620* :  its political and military structures once and for all.
*05:02.060- 05:07.640* :  And so, Israel has been under enormous pressure from its own citizens, many of whom have been
*05:07.640- 05:11.920* :  pleading on behalf of missing relatives, and, of course, foreign governments, in particular,
*05:12.360- 05:16.600* :  the United States, also wanting to try and do everything possible
*05:16.600- 05:22.580* :  to secure the release of hostages before any large-scale military operation was underway.
*05:22.900- 05:27.600* :  I get a slight sense tonight from the words of the foreign ministry of Qatar,
*05:28.200- 05:32.360* :  which has obviously played a key role in this because it has these close links with Hamas,
*05:32.780- 05:39.480* :  that they feel that this dialogue that led to the release of the two hostages today
*05:40.200- 05:44.000* :  could result in further releases, perhaps in the coming days.
*05:44.620- 05:51.320* :  And so I think that could push back the prospect of any wide-ranging large-scale military
*05:51.320- 05:56.940* :  incursion a bit further, although I think it's probably safe to say that Israel will continue
*05:56.940- 06:03.140* :  to conduct all sorts of operations, both in terms of air raids and smaller incursions on the ground
*06:03.140- 06:09.880* :  as they try to prepare the ground for their ultimate objective of eliminating Hamas altogether.
*06:10.740- 06:16.060* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem there, which James Menendez spoke to the rabbi connected to the family
*06:16.060- 06:22.920* :  of the released hostages. He asked rabbi Dov Klein, who's in Evanston outside Chicago for his
*06:22.920- 06:28.280* :  reaction to the releases. I was ecstatic. I mean, I couldn't ask for anything more exciting
*06:28.280- 06:33.580* :  and better. I mean, we've known you who this for 15 years here in Evanston and her daughter,
*06:34.200- 06:39.460* :  on Natalie and the fact that they were released, we've been praying, we've been doing vigils,
*06:39.940- 06:44.380* :  and the fact that they've been released is an unbelievable miracle. So I'm extremely happy,
*06:44.380- 06:50.020* :  it's extremely excited and extremely ecstatic. This has been unbelievable, wonderful news.
*06:50.640- 06:54.620* :  I'm the same token, though, it's a little bit bittersweet because we know that there are
*06:54.620- 07:00.720* :  additional hosts, 203 other hostages that Hamas has. And of course, we are going to continue
*07:00.720- 07:05.180* :  to pray for the release of every single hostage that they should be able to go back home to their
*07:05.180- 07:10.480* :  family and friends. Do you know why Judith and Natalie may have been released as the first hostages
*07:10.480- 07:16.480* :  to be released? Until we hear it directly from them, I don't know if we really know. But one of
*07:16.480- 07:22.180* :  the things I said two weeks ago to my congregation is we were talking and crying and praying. I said,
*07:22.180- 07:27.240* :  if anyone's going to be released first, it's going to be Yuhudi because she has so much hope.
*07:27.580- 07:32.980* :  This is a woman filled with unbelievable joy. Her eyes light up, she's helpful,
*07:32.980- 07:38.440* :  but she also has a tremendous amount of hope. And Elba Rachireb has said,
*07:39.020- 07:42.840* :  a person, a track good, but designed good, a person who thinks positively,
*07:42.860- 07:48.780* :  positive things will happen for them. And I have no doubt that Yuhudi was being positive,
*07:48.780- 07:54.840* :  was being strong and was doing whatever she needed to do in order to bring about the release of
*07:54.840- 07:58.940* :  her and her daughter. And right by the statement from Hamas talked about releasing them on
*07:58.940- 08:02.480* :  humanitarian grounds. I mean, obviously that could mean anything. I mean, I don't want to
*08:02.520- 08:06.260* :  pray too much, but had either of them been ill, are they well as far as you know?
*08:06.380- 08:10.500* :  Bob, until this incident, I was personally not aware of any ailment. That doesn't mean
*08:10.500- 08:14.880* :  something privately wasn't going on that she didn't disclose to me, because Yuhudi wasn't a person
*08:14.880- 08:18.900* :  who would talk about herself and her needs. She was always worried about other people's needs.
*08:19.440- 08:23.720* :  And this must have been hugely shocking when they were taken on the 7th of October for your
*08:24.060- 08:27.920* :  congregation, because they were well, they were visiting relatives at that kebuts in southern
*08:27.920- 08:33.020* :  Israel. Is that right? Yes, they were visiting well as we were beyond shocked. We were extremely,
*08:33.020- 08:38.420* :  extremely surprised. The reason that we were so surprised was, of all people, you know,
*08:38.420- 08:43.420* :  you have so many people in Israel, millions of people, you know, two people who we knew were taken.
*08:43.420- 08:47.840* :  So we were extremely shocked. We were extremely surprised. We just been praying for them,
*08:48.280- 08:55.440* :  you know, just non-stop. And I'm just so happy that they're the first two passages to be released.
*08:56.260- 09:03.640* :  That was the Rabbi Dov Klein. Hamas has said that Qatar helped mediate the releases of the hostages.
*09:03.640- 09:10.620* :  A Christian phraser spoke to Marwan Masha, a former foreign minister of Jordan and longtime diplomat,
*09:10.840- 09:16.600* :  and asked him for his reaction to the releases, and for more on any so-called back-channel discussions
*09:16.600- 09:21.560* :  that may have taken place. That's obviously great news, Christian, you know,
*09:21.560- 09:29.520* :  targeting civilians should never be content. And I hope that this is part of the process in which
*09:29.520- 09:37.640* :  there are negotiations. I know there are negotiations going on as we speak in order to either,
*09:37.960- 09:45.180* :  you know, deter Israel from going all the way to Gaza or having done, you know, in a different way.
*09:45.180- 09:53.440* :  The bottom line is, we do need to stop the habits for our first and engage in a political process
*09:53.440- 09:58.160* :  later. And if this is their prelude to that, then that's extremely good news.
*09:58.520- 10:03.220* :  Why do you think they released these two hostages? They are American citizens.
*10:03.420- 10:08.500* :  There are other hostages that we know were badly injured before they were taken across the border.
*10:08.500- 10:12.480* :  So why these particular two? Is it a message, do you think, from Hamas?
*10:12.720- 10:19.080* :  I truly cannot turn at this stage. I'm not privy to what has been going on, but the very fact
*10:19.140- 10:24.520* :  that Hamas did release hostages is a good sign. It means that there are negotiations going
*10:24.520- 10:31.280* :  on. And like I said, I hope it's part of the bigger deal than the two hostages, but obviously
*10:31.280- 10:36.120* :  it's a good sign. That was Marwan Masha'a, a former foreign minister of Jordan.
*10:37.340- 10:42.000* :  The Palestinian-red presence says Israeli forces have ordered the evacuation of the Al-Quds
*10:42.000- 10:47.780* :  Hospital in Gaza. The hospital has 400 patients and is also reported to be sheltering more
*10:47.780- 10:53.380* :  than 2,000 displaced civilians. The red crescent said it's calling on the international community
*10:53.380- 10:59.400* :  to act urgently to avert another catastrophe. Meanwhile, Hamas' health officials say continuing
*10:59.400- 11:05.780* :  Israeli air strikes have now killed more than 4,100 people in Gaza. Hamas attacked Israel on
*11:05.780- 11:12.940* :  the 7th of October, killing more than 1,400 people. BBC Arabic's Adnan Al-Bush reports from a
*11:12.940- 11:18.500* :  neighborhood in central Gaza on the impact of the bombardments that happened on Thursday night
*11:18.500- 11:26.560* :  into Friday morning. Over night, it's been completely destroyed. 32-hour blokes each containing
*11:26.560- 11:35.180* :  dozens of flats are now totally gone. They told us to evacuate at around 830 or 9 at night.
*11:36.240- 11:43.180* :  We ran through the streets. Then Israel started bombing the area non-stop, from 9 until 7
*11:43.180- 11:46.100* :  this morning. You can see all of this destruction.
*11:56.540- 12:07.260* :  Living stranded in the streets of Gaza with nowhere to go. Other residents say many people remain
*12:07.260- 12:15.060* :  trapped. We cannot bring people out from under the rubble. Embulances cannot get here. We cannot
*12:15.060- 12:21.460* :  pull the bodies out. People are screaming but we cannot pull them out. Last night's attack took
*12:21.460- 12:30.240* :  many residents by surprise. As people told me that it has been a relatively calm area in Gaza.
*12:30.940- 12:36.580* :  We are civilians living peacefully in our homes. Why are you bombing us and ruining our lives?
*12:38.140- 12:45.000* :  As we were filming here, a new warning came in from the Israeli army,
*12:45.000- 12:53.900* :  killing people to evacuate. We have now lived because it's dangerous but the reality is for
*12:53.900- 13:01.000* :  many people still there. There is nowhere safe to go. Adnan El-Bursh in central Gaza.
*13:02.100- 13:07.920* :  While throughout Friday, all eyes were on the Egyptian border with Gaza. Would the
*13:07.920- 13:13.280* :  lorries parked up at the raffer crossing, loaded with food water and essential medicines for
*13:13.280- 13:18.620* :  the territory finally start rolling? Well, they didn't, leaving more than two million people
*13:18.620- 13:24.320* :  in urgent need. Egypt and Israel still can't strike a deal to get the aid flowing,
*13:24.820- 13:28.720* :  which explained the presence of the UN Secretary-General at the border crossing on Friday,
*13:28.720- 13:34.280* :  appealing for the trucks to roll. The BBC's Andrew Harding now reports from northern Egypt.
*13:34.280- 13:40.240* :  He's been to Al-Arish, close to the Gaza border, where a consignment of essential supplies has
*13:40.240- 13:48.140* :  arrived by air from Jordan. High above the Egyptian desert, a consignment of humanitarian aid
*13:48.140- 13:55.920* :  on its way towards the besieged territory of Gaza. This military plane from nearby Jordan
*13:55.920- 14:02.520* :  has brought medical equipment, including bandages and syringes. They join other supplies being
*14:02.520- 14:07.940* :  offloaded here in Egypt, just a few kilometers from the border crossing into Gaza.
*14:10.060- 14:17.160* :  And inside Gaza, more signs of growing hunger and desperation. People scrambling to buy a few
*14:17.160- 14:24.280* :  remaining chickens, encrowded cities that remain entirely cut off from the outside world. No wonder
*14:24.280- 14:32.020* :  there's such pressure to get this aid in. This is an operation brought with risk. The aid
*14:32.400- 14:38.920* :  is to channel vast amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza through one narrow border crossing.
*14:39.300- 14:45.800* :  Amid continuing Israeli air strikes, amid genuine Israeli fears that this route could be used
*14:45.800- 14:51.640* :  by their enemy Hamas to smuggle in more weapons, and amid the constant risk that at any moment
*14:51.640- 14:58.900* :  an Israeli ground offensive could put a stop to all of this. But first, the border itself needs to
*14:58.900- 15:05.720* :  open. A log jam of over a hundred trucks packed with aid still stuck on the Egyptian side
*15:05.720- 15:13.100* :  as negotiations drag on. So when the United Nations Secretary General arrived at the border this
*15:13.100- 15:20.500* :  afternoon, he did not hide his frustration. Behind these walls, we have two million people that
*15:20.500- 15:32.120* :  is suffering enormously. That has no water, no food, no medicine, nearby an angry crowd demanding
*15:32.120- 15:38.380* :  the border be opened and the siege of Gaza lifted. Andrew Harding in Northern Egypt.
*15:40.580- 15:47.180* :  Still to come in this podcast, the tech tycoon Elon Musk is bringing in two new paid for
*15:47.180- 15:53.960* :  subscription formats for his social media platform X. Two tiers of X premium will be long soon.
*15:54.320- 15:58.560* :  The entrepreneur posted online that one tier will be at a lower cost with all features,
*15:58.560- 16:03.960* :  but no reduction in adverts. The second tier is more expensive, but has no ads.
*16:03.960- 16:08.380* :  Before we move on, here's Andrew Peach with news of this week's Happy Pot.
*16:08.820- 16:13.420* :  Yes, there's an animal theme this week with stories about whales in Australia that like to play
*16:13.420- 16:18.400* :  with seaweed and a cat in Pennsylvania that wears glasses to encourage young children to wear
*16:18.400- 16:24.660* :  bare glasses too. We've got innovation to offset climate change in Kenya and Andy, who managed to
*16:24.660- 16:30.420* :  play croquet at the top of a mountain in Sequoia National Park in California and Caroline, who listens
*16:30.420- 16:36.020* :  to the Happy Pot and got in touch to let us hear her children's orchestra in Bogota in Colombia.
*16:36.460- 16:41.040* :  So please join us for half an hour of uplifting stories from around the world in the Happy Pot
*16:41.380- 16:43.460* :  available in this feed every Saturday.
*16:47.060- 16:53.060* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now to other news. A third person close to Donald Trump
*16:53.060- 16:58.240* :  has pleaded guilty in the 2020 US election interference case in the state of Georgia.
*16:58.900- 17:04.800* :  The lawyer Kenneth Chesbroe has been charged for his role in what prosecutors describe as a
*17:04.800- 17:10.020* :  conspiracy to overturn the election in favor of Mr Trump. Nomiya Ikbal reports.
*17:10.580- 17:15.300* :  Kenneth Chesbroe will no longer face a trial next week. He took a plea deal last minute in the
*17:15.300- 17:21.320* :  wide-ranging criminal racketeering indictment. He'll now face a single felony charge of conspiracy
*17:21.320- 17:26.940* :  to commit filing of false documents. He potentially could get a prison sentence and a large fine.
*17:26.940- 17:31.940* :  He has agreed to truthfully testify against the remaining co-defendants,
*17:32.220- 17:37.260* :  something two others including Donald Trump's former lawyer Sydney Powell has also agreed to do.
*17:37.260- 17:43.540* :  This is a victory for prosecutors as it adds real momentum to their case against Mr Trump
*17:43.540- 17:50.600* :  and his remaining co-defendants. Nomiya Ikbal, police in Brazil have arrested two agents of
*17:50.600- 17:56.220* :  the intelligence agency and carried out 25 search and seizure warrant as part of an investigation
*17:56.220- 18:02.080* :  into a legal surveillance. The alleged irregularities happened in the run-up to last year's election.
*18:02.620- 18:08.500* :  Leonardo Rosha reports. Federal police agents raided homes and offices in five Brazilian states.
*18:08.500- 18:14.440* :  Police say the phone hacking targeted members of the Supreme Court as well as politicians, lawyers
*18:14.440- 18:20.300* :  and journalists linked to the opposition. The agency allegedly used sophisticated spying software
*18:20.800- 18:25.340* :  to listen to more than 30,000 phone calls in the run-up to last year's election,
*18:25.780- 18:31.600* :  in which Mr Bolsonaro was defeated by the veteran left-wing leader Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva.
*18:32.280- 18:38.300* :  Leonardo Rosha. Now to West Africa and lawyers representing the deposed president of Niger,
*18:38.300- 18:44.380* :  Mohammed Bazoum say allegations made by the military government that he attempted to escape
*18:44.380- 18:50.820* :  house arrest are false because he's being held unlawfully. Mr Bazoum and his family have been
*18:50.820- 18:56.560* :  confined to their homes since he was forced from office at the end of July. James Reynolds heard more
*18:56.560- 19:01.960* :  from our West Africa correspondent, Mione Jones, who's monitoring events from Lagos in neighboring
*19:01.960- 19:08.620* :  Nigeria. Spokesperson for the Junta came on television late on Thursday and said that Mr Bazoum
*19:08.620- 19:14.120* :  and his family has been detained with his son and his wife as well as two members of staff
*19:14.120- 19:19.700* :  tried to escape in the early hours of Thursday this around three and their plan, according to
*19:19.700- 19:24.880* :  Junta, was to leave the presidential palace where some cars were waiting for them. Those cars
*19:24.880- 19:29.880* :  were drive them to the outskirts of the city of the capital Niami and then from there
*19:29.880- 19:36.600* :  they were allegedly going to be going on two helicopters owned by unnamed and unnamed foreign
*19:36.600- 19:43.620* :  power that would take them here to neighboring Nigeria. But this is something that Mr Bazoum's
*19:43.620- 19:50.140* :  team of lawyers has disputed. They say that Mr Bazoum wasn't trying to escape detention because
*19:50.140- 19:55.860* :  he's been detained illegally. Now that might seem kind of like just legal wrangling but I think
*19:55.860- 19:59.640* :  they're using this opportunity to push the message that Mr Bazoum's human rights have been
*19:59.640- 20:04.900* :  infringed that he hasn't had access to any of his lawyers and they say that this is unacceptable
*20:04.900- 20:09.180* :  for former head of state to be treated this way. Can anyone go and knock on the door and try and
*20:09.180- 20:14.040* :  find him, his lawyers or his supporters? Yeah, that's very tricky right now because nobody knows
*20:14.040- 20:18.820* :  where he is since his incidents. The only person that had been seen him was his doctor.
*20:19.160- 20:24.080* :  Apparently he was going to see the family every other day and today he apparently went to see
*20:24.080- 20:28.680* :  the family with some food for them and wasn't given access and I think that that might have been
*20:28.680- 20:33.420* :  what triggered this statement by his lawyers saying that his human rights have been abused is
*20:33.420- 20:38.120* :  not only does he not have access to his lawyers but he now doesn't have access to any doctor.
*20:38.300- 20:42.560* :  Manny in the introduction I talked about the military government in Niger in practical terms
*20:42.560- 20:47.500* :  how is the military government ruling the country? So the truth has been in power since
*20:47.580- 20:53.600* :  legalized you've mentioned and they're still enjoying I was in Niger a couple of weeks ago
*20:53.600- 20:58.640* :  they are still enjoying what seems like quite a bit of popular support on the streets of Niamhme.
*20:58.760- 21:03.700* :  People were frustrated with Mr Bazoum's party who's been in power for many years they felt
*21:03.700- 21:08.440* :  that it was corrupt even though Mr Bazoum himself was seen as a reformist they were worried that
*21:08.560- 21:13.340* :  you know previous members of our administration were too influential in power there was still
*21:13.340- 21:18.520* :  too much corruption going on so they are happy to see the military junta in power what's not clear
*21:18.520- 21:24.120* :  is how they plan to rule what they've done so far is to kick out the French who are the former colonial
*21:24.120- 21:28.460* :  power in Niger they've asked the UN to leave as well because they accused them of colliding with
*21:28.460- 21:32.380* :  the French to try and reinstate Mr Bazoum into power this is something that you were not
*21:32.380- 21:36.900* :  obviously denies and they say it's going to cause a lot of distress to people in Niger who are
*21:37.380- 21:41.900* :  very poor despite the country being mineral rich and also affected by terror related violence
*21:42.740- 21:45.980* :  and so the way they've ruled so far is by it's kicking out formal allies,
*21:45.980- 21:50.620* :  Western allies that were helping them in despite against terrorism but it's not clear they haven't
*21:50.620- 21:54.540* :  really established what they plan to do for the country how they plan to develop it,
*21:54.880- 21:59.020* :  how they plan to fight terrorism themselves we've seen an optic in terror attacks in Niger since
*21:59.020- 22:06.440* :  to coup. Miley Jones in Nigeria the tech tycoon Elon Musk says his social media platform X
*22:06.440- 22:13.220* :  formerly known as Twitter is to offer two new tiers of premium subscription some users already
*22:13.220- 22:18.600* :  pay nearly nine dollars a month for its blue tech service it's unclear whether there will be a
*22:18.600- 22:24.760* :  free version of the platform here's our technology reporter Shona McCullum as ever with this
*22:24.760- 22:30.020* :  kind of announcement from Elon Musk the detail is thin but what we do know is that two tiers of
*22:30.020- 22:35.620* :  X premium will be launched soon the entrepreneur posted online that one tier will be at a lower cost
*22:35.620- 22:41.940* :  with all features but no reduction in adverts the second tier is more expensive but has no ads
*22:41.940- 22:47.620* :  it's not clear if there will be any free option this development comes as X started charging
*22:47.620- 22:52.640* :  new users in New Zealand and the Philippines a dollar a year for accessing the platform
*22:52.640- 22:58.240* :  one of the main issues with X has been how to monetize it and this is Mr Musk's latest attempt
*22:58.240- 23:03.860* :  he's always said that his solution for getting rid of bots and fake accounts is to charge for the
*23:03.860- 23:10.780* :  service but since his ten years boss began advertisers have left in their droves Shona McCullum
*23:11.680- 23:16.960* :  on Friday the Sydney Opera House was 50 years old it's probably one of the most famous buildings
*23:16.960- 23:22.580* :  in the world it's not the Taj Mahal or the Eiffel Tower but in terms of recently constructed
*23:22.580- 23:28.120* :  buildings it is wronged up there the Opera House is Australia's most popular tourist destination
*23:28.140- 23:34.060* :  welcoming more than 10 million visitors annually it was big news right from the start as this
*23:34.060- 23:40.800* :  1967 report suggests and it's fashionable to admire the Opera House built to epitomize the old
*23:45.500- 23:49.660* :  sailing ships this controversial and lovely Opera House has busted its budgeted costs so
*23:49.660- 23:54.500* :  badly that only a lottery can now finance it it's an architect's dream and a challenge in curves
*23:54.500- 24:00.000* :  to the straight glass and steel structures that now make the skyline oh in Bennett Jones spoke to
*24:00.000- 24:06.620* :  Tristram Carfrey deputy global chair of Arab the company responsible for the engineering of the
*24:06.620- 24:13.240* :  Opera House and its layers of soaring concrete sales so was the building difficult to construct with
*24:13.240- 24:19.760* :  its unusual shapes well I would say it was difficult to design to make it constructible to build
*24:19.760- 24:24.280* :  but in the end actually it was built very easily right you surprised me there so because I
*24:24.280- 24:28.660* :  imagine an architect came up with a hopelessly impractical plan to have these soaring concrete
*24:28.660- 24:33.860* :  structures and then you as the engineers were stuck there thinking how on earth do we do that
*24:34.600- 24:39.680* :  yes a bit like that the architect actually had a romantic notion a beautiful notion for a very
*24:39.680- 24:45.440* :  lyrical extraordinary building to be built on the end of Ben Along Point but actually the
*24:45.440- 24:49.860* :  even the material to be used whether it was concrete or steel was still to be determined but
*24:49.860- 24:55.000* :  working together architect and engineer you know we rationalize the geometry to be something that
*24:55.000- 25:00.200* :  could then be mass produced and erected on site in a very elegant construction process tell us
*25:00.200- 25:05.720* :  about the geometry you had to get your slide rules out did you yes indeed and in fact we only made
*25:05.720- 25:11.160* :  it work by the use first one of the first uses of digital computers in construction and design so
*25:11.160- 25:16.780* :  we're using the big computers in the basements of universities firstly in England and then in
*25:16.780- 25:23.260* :  Australia but the main thing as I say was to take a what started as an irrational geometry a sketch
*25:24.000- 25:29.160* :  and turn it into something that was both rational and repetitive in fact all the surfaces of the
*25:29.160- 25:35.780* :  building built are taken from the same sphere the same ball the same football if you like or or
*25:36.640- 25:40.920* :  orange yeah you've lost me there so you get an orange on a on a piece of paper you get a sphere
*25:41.320- 25:46.600* :  on a piece of paper and you're trying to work out how to make it solid so that it
*25:46.600- 25:51.780* :  can be built and be weren't collapse absolutely definitely weren't collapse and as you say to be built
*25:52.220- 25:57.140* :  but actually it's a hollow sphere or hollow orange but the concrete ribs that make up the
*25:57.140- 26:03.580* :  sales the dominant part of the opera has what gives it its unique image it's beauty if you like
*26:03.580- 26:09.520* :  the glistening tile sales they are made from concrete ribs which are in effect the same as
*26:09.520- 26:15.660* :  the segments of an orange and what I mean by that is they repeat so each one can be made out of
*26:15.660- 26:21.700* :  concrete ribs cast in the same mold out of individual pieces that are then lifted into place
*26:22.520- 26:27.020* :  glued together with epoxy glue and we're talking now you know something being done in the early
*26:27.020- 26:36.240* :  60s and then clamped together using steel tendons high strength steel strands so then jacked
*26:36.560- 26:41.760* :  to hold each bit of concrete to each other bit of concrete and in the end we get an interval structure
*26:42.060- 26:48.000* :  and all this was done at on Benelong Point in the full public view over a period of years obviously
*26:48.000- 26:52.920* :  not that many years but a few years and so in some ways this construction was the first
*26:52.920- 27:00.280* :  public performance of the opera house Tristrom Carfrey and that's all from us for now but before
*27:00.280- 27:06.040* :  we go here's Jackie Leonard with details of another special podcast on the Israel Gaza conflict
*27:06.560- 27:11.080* :  yes thanks Nick as you might remember a week ago we put listeners questions about Israel and
*27:11.080- 27:16.400* :  Gaza to our correspondents in the region leaves do set and Jeremy Bowen and the response was
*27:16.400- 27:20.420* :  such that we're doing it again obviously a great deal has happened since the last edition
*27:20.860- 27:25.520* :  this time we have questions about the hostages about the Israeli policy of telling civilians to
*27:25.520- 27:32.120* :  vacate northern Gaza what Hamas wants and the UN response the global news podcast special edition
*27:32.120- 27:37.420* :  will be up early on Saturday and if you want to comment on this podcast all the topics covered in it
*27:37.420- 27:43.620* :  you can send us an email the address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk you can also find us on
*27:43.620- 27:50.360* :  x formally known as Twitter at global news pod this edition was mixed by Chris Hanson the producer
*27:50.360- 27:55.580* :  was Liam McChaffrey the editor is Karen Martin i'm Nick Miles and until next time goodbye
