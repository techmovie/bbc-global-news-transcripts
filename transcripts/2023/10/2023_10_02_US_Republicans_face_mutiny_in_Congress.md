*00:00.040- 00:04.140* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.080- 00:10.180* :  I'm Nigel Adely and in the early hours of Monday, the 2nd of October,
*00:10.180- 00:15.920* :  these are our main stories. The fallout continues from Saturday's temporary deal
*00:15.920- 00:21.600* :  to avoid a U.S. government shutdown, as further military aid to Ukraine is now under threat,
*00:21.600- 00:27.200* :  and deep political divisions are exposed. Hundreds of thousands of polls join the
*00:27.200- 00:31.000* :  not-position rally in Warsaw, ahead of a crucial general election.
*00:31.700- 00:37.140* :  And we're here from the writer of a new play, which recalls the miraculous escape of Danish Jews
*00:37.140- 00:44.620* :  during World War II. Ordinary Danes, fishermen, policemen, nurses, priests, they stood up
*00:45.060- 00:49.120* :  and they helped them at risk of their own lives and potentially their families lives as well.
*00:52.600- 00:58.560* :  Also in this podcast, Turkey hits Kurdish targets in Northern Iraq, following a suicide bombing
*00:58.560- 01:05.320* :  near the parliament in Ankara. And... Sorry, proud. I mean, it was rollercoaster today.
*01:05.940- 01:10.020* :  Never felt so many emotions. Guys, it's just hung in there like I knew they would.
*01:10.520- 01:16.740* :  High drama, as European golfers hold off an American revival to reclaim the writer cup.
*01:21.200- 01:28.000* :  Mugene could be about to descend on U.S. Congress. A hardline Republican, Matt Gates says he will
*01:28.000- 01:33.600* :  seek to oust how Speaker Kevin McCarthy, after he defied the right wing of his own party,
*01:34.200- 01:38.240* :  and pushed through a last-minute spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.
*01:39.100- 01:43.720* :  Without enough support from the Republicans, he relied on opposition Democrats.
*01:44.640- 01:51.620* :  On the U.S. broadcaster ABC on Sunday, Mr. Gates accused Mr. McCarthy of having lied to conservative
*01:51.620- 01:57.780* :  members of the party. America's lawmakers take one upper down vote on the funding of the entire
*01:57.780- 02:02.420* :  government. That is crazy. That is the reason we're 33 trillion in debt. We want to move to
*02:02.420- 02:07.180* :  single-subject spending bills. So he made that commitment. He broke it. And if at this time,
*02:07.180- 02:12.800* :  next week, Kevin McCarthy is still Speaker of the House. It will be because the Democrats bailed
*02:12.800- 02:17.960* :  him out, and he can be their Speaker, not mine. McCarthy said he would survive Gates' challenge,
*02:17.960- 02:25.720* :  which he dismissed as a personal quibble. Matt voted against the most conservative ability to
*02:26.080- 02:30.740* :  secure a border. He's more interested in securing TV interviews than doing something. He wanted
*02:30.740- 02:36.040* :  to push us into a shutdown, even threatening his own district with all the military people there
*02:36.040- 02:40.880* :  who would not be paid. If he's upset because he tried to push us in a shutdown, and I made sure
*02:40.880- 02:45.620* :  government didn't shut down, then let's have that fight. On North America correspondent Sean
*02:45.620- 02:52.100* :  Dilly told me what this rail says about divisions within the Republican Party. It tells us it's exactly
*02:52.100- 02:58.000* :  as divided no more, no less than it was last week, last month. Indeed, when Kevin McCarthy was
*02:58.000- 03:04.180* :  elected as Speaker, he's not a liked man. Let's be frank about it. Democrats despise him because
*03:04.180- 03:10.180* :  he had launched an impeachment inquiry into the President Joe Biden, breaking a promise that he'd
*03:10.180- 03:15.100* :  hold a vote on the floor before he did that. Republicans are not as big as fans either. If you look
*03:15.100- 03:20.920* :  back to his election, it took four days and 15 rounds to put him in office. And ever since he's
*03:20.920- 03:27.180* :  done that, at least nine very hard-line Republicans, Matt Gates, chief among them, have been
*03:27.260- 03:31.480* :  threatening to remove him from office. He says now he's going to do that, but actually he's
*03:31.480- 03:36.720* :  probably not going to manage it on this occasion. What would have to happen for McCarthy to go?
*03:37.220- 03:42.800* :  Due to a compromised deal that McCarthy did when he was elected as Speaker, any member of the House
*03:42.800- 03:48.240* :  Republican or Democrats can put a motion on the floor to vacate, and then you'd need a simple
*03:48.240- 03:54.600* :  majority of the House. You'd have to find 218 members of the House of Representatives to support
*03:54.600- 04:00.160* :  that. Another reason that's not going to happen is Democratic politicians supported the very last
*04:00.220- 04:06.780* :  minute deal that Kevin McCarthy put to the House yesterday. They compromised massively because it
*04:06.780- 04:12.640* :  did not allow any additional funding for Ukraine. Republicans compromised because it didn't cut
*04:12.640- 04:18.100* :  as deeply as they wanted to, but the Democrats only supported it because McCarthy promised them
*04:18.100- 04:22.940* :  that if they did to keep the government open, that he would, within the coming days, introduce
*04:22.940- 04:27.460* :  a separate funding bill for Ukraine, a temporary funding bill. Now look, here's the reality.
*04:28.000- 04:33.160* :  No Kevin McCarthy almost certainly means no Ukraine funding bill, which almost certainly means
*04:33.160- 04:38.080* :  Democratic politicians through very gritted teeth will support a man they really have very
*04:38.080- 04:44.680* :  little time for. Sean Dilly, now to Slovakia where in yesterday's podcast, we were reporting that
*04:44.680- 04:51.900* :  the liberal pro-Western party, Progressive Slovakia, were unexpectedly heading for victory in Saturday's
*04:51.900- 04:59.000* :  election. Now, a day later, the reverses happened because the pro-Mosco leader of the smare party
*04:59.000- 05:06.180* :  Robert Fizo has emerged as the winner. He's raised many eyebrows in the West by vowing to stop
*05:06.180- 05:10.860* :  sending military aid to Ukraine. From Prague in the neighbouring Czech Republic,
*05:11.500- 05:14.760* :  Rob Cameron reports on a remarkable turn of events.
*05:19.080- 05:24.780* :  Jubilation at smare party headquarters, as they realised they were on track for a fourth chance
*05:24.780- 05:34.880* :  at government. Yet again, Robert Fizo has wrong-footed his opponents, who wouldn't be singing from
*05:34.880- 05:43.600* :  a balcony at 4 a.m. after a comeback like this. Later, there were glimpses of what a new
*05:43.600- 05:49.580* :  Fizo government might look like, and perhaps just a hint that the thundering rhetoric on Ukraine
*05:49.740- 05:56.820* :  might soon be retired. Slovakia and people in Slovakia have bigger problems than Ukraine.
*05:56.820- 06:02.200* :  That's all I can say. If smare forms next government, then we'll do everything in our power,
*06:02.600- 06:06.080* :  including at EU level, to ensure peace talks start as soon as possible.
*06:06.380- 06:11.700* :  Indeed, Slovak observers are more alarmed about what smare plans at home than abroad.
*06:11.740- 06:17.480* :  Mr Fizo said he'd immediately fire the chief of police and the special prosecutor.
*06:18.500- 06:24.020* :  Rob Cameron. Hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters have been rallying in Warsaw,
*06:24.620- 06:27.260* :  ahead of parliamentary elections later this month.
*06:33.860- 06:38.300* :  Footage on social media showed wide avenues and huge squares packed,
*06:39.000- 06:44.560* :  with Polish and European Union flags prominent. The opposition leader, Donald Tusk,
*06:44.900- 06:50.760* :  called the march a breakthrough in Poland's history, but his party is still trailing in the
*06:50.760- 06:55.900* :  opinion polls. It's trying to stop the right-wing incumbent for law and justice party
*06:55.900- 07:02.500* :  from winning an unprecedented third term, saying the government is endangering the democratic gains
*07:02.500- 07:07.940* :  of the past three decades. These people explained why they joined the protest.
*07:08.580- 07:15.380* :  Poland to be free. I don't want the return of the communist regime, which I remember very well,
*07:15.720- 07:21.900* :  draps, trees, people afraid of talking politics or anything. In fact, the oppressive police.
*07:23.260- 07:31.000* :  I feel like a European, but I'm no longer so sure that we will stay in the European Union
*07:31.000- 07:38.240* :  if law and justice stays for the third term. So did it live up to its billing of the march of
*07:38.240- 07:44.120* :  a million hearts? A question for our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford, who was there?
*07:44.460- 07:48.580* :  We're certainly huge. There were hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Warsaw.
*07:48.580- 07:54.440* :  The city hall has said it was a million people. The governing party and state media are playing
*07:54.440- 08:00.000* :  it down massively, talking about less than 100,000, but I stood there for three hours and I saw
*08:00.000- 08:06.780* :  huge crowds of people pouring past me nonstop. It was a really big turnout and everyone who we
*08:06.780- 08:11.340* :  spoke to who'd come out, many of them were carrying the Polish flag, lots of them carrying the EU
*08:11.340- 08:16.580* :  flag as well. They all see this as a really critical election for Poland and for its future.
*08:16.900- 08:21.360* :  Lots of people believe as the opposition leader Donald Tusk has been saying that this is about
*08:21.360- 08:26.880* :  whether or not it remains a democratic country going forward and about its place in the EU,
*08:26.880- 08:31.980* :  because they are portraying the governing party law and justice as a threat to democracy,
*08:31.980- 08:36.680* :  as eroding basic principles like the rule of law and the freedom of the media and they say
*08:36.680- 08:41.500* :  all of that is jeopardising Poland's democratic future. And the government have accused the
*08:41.500- 08:46.980* :  opposition of being unpatriotic. Just give us a flavour of their time in power. That claim of
*08:46.980- 08:51.340* :  unpatriotic is precisely why there were so many Polish flags there today and precisely why
*08:51.340- 08:57.100* :  Donald Tusk made a point of saying that he loved Poland and he was ready to die for Poland,
*08:57.240- 09:03.380* :  because it's been quite a vicious election campaign so far. We've seen some really nasty
*09:03.380- 09:07.640* :  language used actually by both sides. I mean Donald Tusk describes the government as evil.
*09:07.640- 09:13.300* :  The government describes him as a foreign agent and as a stooge of Germany essentially as a traitor
*09:13.700- 09:18.440* :  and there have been all sorts of social media, adverts and videos and general language from
*09:18.440- 09:23.380* :  the government portraying the opposition as betraying Poland's national interest. So I think
*09:23.380- 09:28.200* :  that's a lot of what today's sea of red and white was about. They described wanting an open
*09:28.200- 09:33.760* :  and tolerant Poland. They want an end to the friction with the EU that they see has been increasing
*09:33.760- 09:39.800* :  under the governing party so far and they want a country where they feel it has the kind of future
*09:39.800- 09:43.860* :  that they would like to choose for their children. One of the biggest messages from today was
*09:43.860- 09:47.920* :  Donald Tusk telling people to go out and to get all of their friends and their colleagues to vote,
*09:48.040- 09:52.940* :  though he was very much making the case that this is the most important election in Poland since 1989
*09:53.020- 09:57.600* :  and the end of communism. He said there was a huge amount at stake and that everybody should turn
*09:57.600- 10:03.940* :  out and take part in the vote. Sarah Rainesford in Warsaw. FIFA and its African subsidiary,
*10:03.940- 10:09.700* :  the Confederation of African Football, are facing accusations of failing to take effective action
*10:09.700- 10:15.900* :  to deal with the scandal of abuse of young footballers in Gabon. BBC Africa, I,
*10:15.900- 10:23.120* :  has spoken to dozens of witnesses who describe a long-standing sexual abusering within Gabon's
*10:23.120- 10:32.080* :  football world. Caridier II, Cise, reports. We were at a football training camp for the
*10:32.420- 10:37.580* :  under 17 selection team. This young man is talking about his time as a footballer in
*10:37.580- 10:41.720* :  Gabon's youth team, where using an actor's voice to protect his identity.
*10:42.840- 10:46.500* :  On the fourth night of the camp, they came to wake me and my best friend.
*10:48.400- 10:54.180* :  They took us to a room with red lights. It was full of naked men. They started touching me
*10:54.180- 10:59.120* :  and my friend and I just didn't understand. I wanted to scream.
*10:59.840- 11:06.200* :  He says he was sexually assaulted and made to watch his friend get raped by their football coaches.
*11:07.120- 11:13.480* :  Among them was Patrick Asumoei, better known as Capelo, the head coach of Gabon's youth team.
*11:14.280- 11:20.400* :  Africa I has spoken to more than 30 witnesses who said Capelo and others were predators
*11:20.400- 11:25.420* :  in a sexual abuse ring that has plagued Gabon's football world for decades.
*11:26.360- 11:29.440* :  The BBC was told the Gabon's football federation,
*11:30.060- 11:34.480* :  were made aware of it. Former Gabon international player,
*11:34.480- 11:39.000* :  Paffenon, says he escalated the issue all the way to the top.
*11:39.000- 11:45.300* :  I spoke to the president of the league. I spoke to the president of the federation.
*11:45.300- 11:52.440* :  But it was only after an expose in the garden in 2021 that Capelo was arrested. He admitted
*11:52.440- 11:56.820* :  to charges of raping, grooming, and exploiting young players.
*11:57.700- 12:03.840* :  Months later, the president of FegaFoot, Perala Mugengi, was also arrested on the charge of
*12:03.840- 12:10.140* :  failing to report crimes of pedophilia. But unlike Capelo, football governing bodies did not
*12:10.140- 12:15.820* :  suspend him from his role. Remy Ebenega is the president of Gabon's National Footballers Union.
*12:17.580- 12:22.240* :  The local justice system has imprisoned the president of the federation and FIFA did nothing.
*12:22.240- 12:25.200* :  He continued to manage the federation while he was in prison.
*12:25.700- 12:29.560* :  After almost six months in prison, Mugengi was provisionally released,
*12:29.560- 12:35.700* :  and in July 2023, he was re-elected to the Executive Committee of Caph,
*12:36.100- 12:39.840* :  the Confederation of African Football, a FIFA subsidiary.
*12:40.200- 12:45.160* :  Caph's secretary general has defended the decision to not impose sanctions on Mugengi.
*12:45.460- 12:51.720* :  If today there is no decision up there, just to say that Mugengi, you are guilty, you are essential.
*12:52.500- 12:55.120* :  How can the sanction this?
*12:55.980- 13:00.580* :  But witnesses say no meaningful child protection measures have been put in place,
*13:00.980- 13:05.680* :  and both Caph and FIFA have come under criticism for failing to act.
*13:06.240- 13:12.120* :  Loïc Alves is a Senior Legal Council for 5th Pro, the International Football Players Union.
*13:12.120- 13:19.000* :  Caph and Orfifa, they have no obligation to wait for a state decision before the sanction
*13:19.000- 13:23.700* :  someone, for violations of disciplinary codes and codes of ethics.
*13:24.180- 13:28.520* :  The BBC believes all suspensions of those arrested have now lapsed.
*13:29.300- 13:35.360* :  Pierre Alves Mugengi, FegaFoot, FIFA and Caph deny all the allegations made against them.
*13:35.640- 13:40.780* :  They say all appropriate action was taken as soon as the allegations were made public,
*13:41.300- 13:45.040* :  and FIFA's Ethics Committee investigation is still ongoing.
*13:45.900- 13:49.840* :  All parties condemn child abuse in the strongest possible terms,
*13:50.600- 13:55.180* :  but in Gabon, many are still waiting for both answers and action.
*13:58.860- 14:03.580* :  It's been called a miracle that in barely one night during the Second World War,
*14:04.120- 14:10.780* :  Denmark was able to save 90% of its Jewish population from deportation at the hand of the
*14:10.780- 14:19.340* :  occupying Nazis. 80 years ago, 7,000 Jews escaped by boat to Sweden, following a mysterious tip
*14:19.340- 14:27.040* :  off. Bent Melcure, later to become Denmark's chief rabbi, was 14 years old when he boarded one
*14:27.040- 14:35.200* :  of the fishing boats. We were gathered in this boat that was supposed to carry herrings,
*14:36.000- 14:42.860* :  but instead of that they were carrying human beings. Can you imagine that people started to be sick,
*14:43.800- 14:49.220* :  they are in the boat, we were hiding underneath so that nobody should see that there were so many
*14:49.220- 14:55.800* :  people on the boat. So every minute was like an hour. Shortly before the planned deportation,
*14:55.800- 15:02.500* :  a warning was given by a chief rabbi. There will be no press today, pack your bags and find a way
*15:02.500- 15:09.560* :  to disappear. It was this moment that inspired the author Alexander Bolden Safir to pen a play.
*15:09.580- 15:16.320* :  It will receive its first ever reading in Denmark this week. Safir described the unique warning
*15:16.320- 15:22.700* :  his own grandfather received to the BBC's Johnny Diamond. He was working as a tailor in his brother
*15:22.700- 15:28.520* :  and law shop and in walked a high ranking German official. He told my grandfather my brother
*15:28.520- 15:34.440* :  that they needed to get out and get out as quickly as they could. It wasn't until many years later
*15:34.680- 15:40.800* :  that an additional wrinkle to that story really spurred me on. The wrinkle that you talk about
*15:40.800- 15:48.100* :  is that perhaps it wasn't just the odd German officer saying something on the ward or leaking
*15:48.100- 15:58.020* :  something to a friendly Danish native, but in fact that this was leaked on purpose by one of the
*15:58.020- 16:02.480* :  most senior Nazis in the country. Well yes, the narrative immediately after the war was that
*16:02.480- 16:08.100* :  the right hand man of then a best who was the plenipotentry of Denmark leaked the information.
*16:08.220- 16:14.800* :  What has since come out is that the German patrol boats that were guarding the waterway
*16:14.800- 16:20.360* :  between Denmark and Sweden when it became clear that the Jews were escaping across the water.
*16:20.360- 16:25.840* :  Those patrol boats were all brought into harbour and the reason the official reason was that
*16:25.840- 16:31.040* :  they all needed a paint job. All at the same time. All at the same time exactly exactly. What we now
*16:31.040- 16:39.120* :  know is that when Hitler ordered then a best to make Denmark Udenheim to make it Jew-free. After
*16:39.120- 16:46.800* :  the failure of the roundup Hitler then telegramed best to explain himself and best said I have done
*16:46.800- 16:52.860* :  what you ordered. I have made Denmark Udenheim Jew-free and that comes back to the story of my grandfather
*16:52.860- 16:58.660* :  because my grandfather never told us the name of the high-ranking German official that warned him,
*16:58.660- 17:05.640* :  but his brother-in-law, Nat, on his deathbed mentioned a name and that name was then a best. Dr.
*17:05.640- 17:10.780* :  Karl Rudolf then a best. And so he really had a dilemma on his hands. How is he going to
*17:10.780- 17:16.860* :  placate Hitler and fulfill that order of making Denmark Udenheim without stopping the flow
*17:16.860- 17:22.800* :  of agriculture and small arms emissions that were being manufactured in Denmark? And so as a
*17:22.800- 17:28.400* :  calculating man I think he made a decision and he played both sides. You have injected several
*17:28.400- 17:35.300* :  shades of grey into a history perhaps that the Danes would prefer to see a little more black and white
*17:35.300- 17:41.160* :  with clearer heroes and villains involved, but it's a different kind of story that you're
*17:41.160- 17:45.940* :  turning more nuanced. It is but I don't think that necessarily takes away from the miracle,
*17:45.940- 17:50.640* :  but I think the miracle is slightly different. It is the fact that ordinary Danes,
*17:51.020- 17:58.020* :  fishermen, policemen, nurses, priests, they stood up and they helped them at risk of their
*17:58.020- 18:03.440* :  own lives and potentially their family's lives as well. And yes it is more nuanced and more complex,
*18:03.440- 18:10.020* :  but I think that's a difference between a story and reality. And I don't see it as any less
*18:10.020- 18:15.420* :  of a miracle, but it is certainly less black and white. Alexander Bowden Saafir. And his
*18:15.420- 18:20.440* :  play about the exodus of Jews from Denmark opens next week in Copenhagen.
*18:24.340- 18:30.700* :  Still to come on the global news podcast. I've been composing mostly pop songs and after the
*18:30.700- 18:36.600* :  military, I don't want to do more pop songs. I want to make more serious, deep music.
*18:36.920- 18:42.680* :  We meet the creator of the music for the huge Netflix series Squid Game and the Oscar-winning film
*18:52.620- 18:58.200* :  Parasite. Turkey says it's carried out air strikes against the PKK rebel group in retaliation
*18:58.200- 19:04.900* :  for a suicide bombing near the Turkish Parliament on Sunday. The blast in Ankara injured two police
*19:04.900- 19:11.140* :  officers. Victoria Craig is a reporter in the Turkish capital. She told us more about Turkey's
*19:11.140- 19:18.340* :  protracted fight against the PKK. The PKK, which is a Kurdish militant group called the Kurdistan
*19:18.340- 19:25.080* :  Workers Party, has long been a designated terror organization by the US, Turkey and the European
*19:25.080- 19:30.960* :  Union. The interior ministry for its part according to state media says that one of the attackers
*19:30.960- 19:37.220* :  is a member of the group. And this group has, as I said, claimed responsibility for the attack,
*19:37.220- 19:42.060* :  saying it was designed to coincide with the opening of the Turkish Parliament this afternoon
*19:42.060- 19:46.540* :  and carried out by a team linked to one of its own called the Immortals battalion.
*19:47.220- 19:51.460* :  And just to put this in a bit of context, this group has carried out attacks across Turkey over
*19:51.460- 19:56.960* :  the last several decades. Ultimately, it wants an independent state. Now, hours after the group
*19:56.960- 20:01.380* :  claimed responsibility this evening here in Turkey for the bombing today, the defense department
*20:01.380- 20:07.660* :  said that it has already carried out strikes in northern Iraq, where the PKK is based. And it said
*20:07.660- 20:13.560* :  that many terrorists were neutralized across 20 sites. It destroyed caves, bunkers, shelters,
*20:13.560- 20:19.420* :  and warehouses, quote, in order to eliminate terrorist attacks against our people and security forces.
*20:19.900- 20:26.080* :  Victoria Craig in Ankara. Three days of mourning have been declared in the Spanish region of
*20:26.080- 20:32.900* :  Murthia, after a fire which engulfed three night clubs killed at least 13 people. The fire
*20:32.900- 20:38.540* :  is said to have started in one of the clubs in the early morning and quickly spread. Several people
*20:38.540- 20:44.180* :  are being treated in hospital. Jose Ballesta is the mayor of the city of Murthia.
*20:45.760- 20:50.900* :  What we are now concentrating on is looking after the families of the victims, recover the bodies,
*20:51.160- 20:57.180* :  the search for those who could still be in there. And those are the urgent, the important issues.
*20:57.760- 21:02.460* :  Our correspondent in Spain, Guy Hegeco, told me the latest on the rescue operation.
*21:02.920- 21:08.100* :  The emergency services are still in these night clubs and there's a tremendous amount of
*21:08.100- 21:12.780* :  rubble because of the fire. They're looking to see if there are more bodies. There certainly are
*21:12.780- 21:18.540* :  other people who are believed to be missing. And then the big task right now for the police is to
*21:18.540- 21:24.320* :  identify the bodies that have been found. So they're doing DNA tests on those bodies with the
*21:24.320- 21:30.200* :  cooperation of relatives of people who are believed to have been in the night clubs during the fire.
*21:30.600- 21:35.100* :  And so we've been warned that the process of identifying the bodies could take quite a while
*21:35.100- 21:40.340* :  and quite some days possibly. Do the police have any idea at this stage what started the fire?
*21:40.600- 21:45.460* :  No, I mean we've been told that there's no theory at the moment regarding the cause of the fire.
*21:45.460- 21:52.460* :  What we do know is that it appears to have started in one of these night clubs which are on the
*21:52.460- 21:58.360* :  outskirts of Mauritius City and there are two night clubs next to it and the fire spread across
*21:58.360- 22:04.260* :  these three night clubs very quickly. One of them was particularly badly affected, certainly part of
*22:04.260- 22:10.460* :  its structure seemed to collapse because of the fire and that in turn has made the rescue operation
*22:10.460- 22:17.800* :  that much more difficult. And how rare are such incidents in Spain? Well this is the worst night club
*22:17.800- 22:24.740* :  fire in Spain. Certainly since 1990 there was a fire in in Saragossa when 43 people died and
*22:24.760- 22:31.640* :  we haven't seen anything on this scale in this three decade since. So this kind of tragedy is
*22:31.640- 22:37.040* :  unusual and when you add that that the fact that Mauritius is not a huge city it obviously has a
*22:37.040- 22:43.440* :  tremendous impact on the local community. Guy Hedgeko. The United Nations has put boots on the
*22:43.440- 22:49.800* :  ground and the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and it's for the first time in roughly 30 years.
*22:50.760- 22:57.480* :  Since Azerbaijan took control during a short military offensive last month over 100,000 ethnic
*22:57.480- 23:04.380* :  Armenians have packed up their lives and fled. Among them is Spartak Harut Nunean.
*23:06.940- 23:12.860* :  I left so many things there but I'm not concerned about it. If there's a choice between leaving
*23:12.860- 23:19.380* :  things behind and staying, I'd chose leaving. Azerbaijan has been accused of ethnic cleansing by the
*23:19.380- 23:26.200* :  Armenians. I asked our Europeaner Tadani Abahad how the Azeri government has responded to the
*23:26.200- 23:32.720* :  allegations. Well they denied him outright Nigel. They say that the ethnic Armenian population of
*23:32.720- 23:38.120* :  Nagorno-Karabakh are free to stay or go. There's certainly no compulsion on their part. They say
*23:38.120- 23:44.000* :  in terms of forcing people out as has been alleged. One of the presidential advisors says that
*23:44.260- 23:49.440* :  there's been no case of violence against civilians. The Karabakh Armenians may dispute that,
*23:49.440- 23:54.600* :  but that's his position. There is of course a huge lack of trust between the two sides
*23:55.040- 24:00.440* :  due to repeated outbreaks of fighting over the past three decades and France has criticized
*24:00.460- 24:06.460* :  Azerbaijan. They basically accused Azerbaijan of waiting until virtually all of the Karabakh Armenians
*24:06.780- 24:11.660* :  have left before inviting in the UN. And what is the latest on the exodus of refugees?
*24:11.940- 24:18.220* :  The exodus has slowed to a trickle. I mean it unfurled with staggering speed since the 20th of September
*24:18.220- 24:23.780* :  when the Azeri military operation ended. But on Saturday the Armenian authorities
*24:24.120- 24:32.620* :  talked about 100,417 people having left. Today's figure earlier on Sunday was 100,490. So just
*24:32.620- 24:39.120* :  a difference of 73 people, one journalist for the French news agency AFP said that basically had
*24:39.120- 24:44.900* :  been on the border and seen one car. What we don't know at still at this stage is exactly how many
*24:44.900- 24:51.080* :  Karabakh Armenians remain in the enclave. There are also some people reportedly with special needs.
*24:51.260- 24:57.580* :  And there is a bit of a disparity between the 120,000 people that was estimated to be the population
*24:57.580- 25:02.940* :  before the latest outbreak of fighting and the 100,000 people who have left. That hasn't been
*25:02.940- 25:08.980* :  accounted for fully. But we do know the needs of the people who have fled are huge. The WHO,
*25:08.980- 25:14.060* :  the World Health Organization has talked about the fact it's going to take a long time to resolve
*25:14.060- 25:20.420* :  this crisis. They're sending in experts mental health issues, burns treatment for the people who
*25:20.420- 25:28.660* :  survived the fuel depot explosion on Monday and things like pre-fabricated clinics to try to
*25:28.660- 25:34.060* :  cope with this huge humanitarian crisis within Armenia now. Daniel Bajard.
*25:34.740- 25:40.480* :  Goals ride a carpe is back in European hands after they held off an American fight back on the
*25:40.480- 25:46.720* :  final day of competition in Rome. Europe began with a five-point lead, which they ultimately
*25:46.720- 25:53.400* :  maintained to win by 16 and a half points to 11 and a half. But there were plenty of nerves for
*25:53.400- 25:59.920* :  the home crowd as the US team started the day well before eventually falling away. Europe's
*25:59.920- 26:06.560* :  captain, Luke Donald, was delighted. Very proud. I mean, it was a roller coaster today.
*26:07.620- 26:13.520* :  Never felt so many emotions, but our guys just hung in there like I knew they would and
*26:14.300- 26:18.660* :  it's bad we got over the line. It's just so happy, so happy for these 12 guys that they can
*26:18.660- 26:24.500* :  remember this week forever. Our sports reporter James Gregg watched the day's dramatic developments.
*26:25.160- 26:31.460* :  All eyes were on those top matches. European captain Luke Donald had loaded the 12 singles matches
*26:31.460- 26:38.580* :  up with his star names, John Ram, Victor Houghland, Justin Rose, the elder statesman of either side
*26:38.580- 26:45.000* :  and Rory McAroy made up the top four matches. And it was very nip and took. John Ram and the
*26:45.000- 26:50.000* :  World No. 1 Scotty Sheffler had a fantastic ding dong battle that ended up as a tied result,
*26:50.000- 26:55.520* :  but there was so much as we say red on the leaderboard, red for team USA. In the end,
*26:55.820- 26:59.260* :  as we know now, you've got over the line, but at so many points there was so many different
*26:59.260- 27:03.920* :  ebbs and flows. We had no idea which way it was going and you could feel that all the way across
*27:03.920- 27:08.560* :  the golf course. It was a fizzing atmosphere. And of course there was drama in the clubhouse
*27:09.020- 27:12.680* :  on Saturday evening between Rory McAroy and one of the American caddies.
*27:13.020- 27:17.080* :  McAroy wasn't happy with an incident that happened in the very last of the four ball matches
*27:17.080- 27:21.260* :  on Saturday afternoon. That obviously boiled over. There were words exchanged between the caddie
*27:21.260- 27:26.000* :  of Patrick Cantlay, who himself was involved in a bit of controversy. That was something that
*27:26.000- 27:30.680* :  all of us as commentators and journalists were talking about. The fans were well aware of it as
*27:30.680- 27:34.900* :  well. You could sense that they knew about the needle that had been created. And that obviously
*27:34.900- 27:40.720* :  bubbled through into this morning. And it did create a very exciting contest. That was kind of what
*27:40.720- 27:45.960* :  this morning needed because the gap was so big. The lead was so huge in favour of team Euro.
*27:46.500- 27:51.020* :  As it got a little bit closer, it really did feel like there was something to play for for team USA.
*27:51.020- 27:57.940* :  That was very much a really cool talking point. James Greg in Rome. A celebration of South
*27:57.940- 28:02.980* :  Korean pop culture is coming to London this week with the K Music Festival.
*28:03.940- 28:08.520* :  Now in its 10th year, the festival will host big names like Jung Jae-Eel,
*28:08.960- 28:13.580* :  who made the soundtracks for the internationally successful Netflix series Squid Game
*28:14.160- 28:19.000* :  and Oscar-winning film Parasite. He's been speaking to Crouper Paddy.
*28:26.140- 28:30.980* :  Let's start with Squid Game. Immediately identifiable. I remember hearing it through
*28:30.980- 28:35.260* :  my neighbour's wall because everybody was watching it. That is the music for the Squid Game.
*28:36.420- 28:40.220* :  How does that process go, making a track for a series like that?
*28:40.660- 28:47.040* :  Well, for me, every project is just same. I start from the script and director's intention.
*28:47.100- 28:55.600* :  It was just the first time for me to make series because I'm very used to two hours of film.
*28:56.440- 29:01.440* :  And it was nine hours film, so I had to be prepared a lot.
*29:08.740- 29:14.020* :  But then what's remarkable is your ability to switch genres because you hear the music from
*29:14.020- 29:19.260* :  Squid Game and then you hear the music from Parasite, which is remarkably different,
*29:19.260- 29:23.620* :  that classical vibe you have going there. How easy is it to make that transition?
*29:24.520- 29:31.040* :  It's not that easy, but I have to do that because directors' intention and the script
*29:31.040- 29:37.220* :  is very important. They are everything. So if they requires classical, if they requires rock,
*29:37.680- 29:39.740* :  if they requires hip-hop, I have to do that.
*29:49.640- 29:52.900* :  Am I right in thinking that in the case of Parasite, the music score
*29:52.900- 30:01.140* :  was rejected seven times. Oh, that's average. Really? But equally, the same director has said
*30:01.140- 30:06.260* :  that you are one of the most detailed and delicate music directors on earth, quite the praise.
*30:06.720- 30:10.560* :  You've actually said writing music was my only way to survive.
*30:11.880- 30:21.180* :  Oh, how did you find that? That's a very moving statement. You're so well-known now within your
*30:21.180- 30:25.780* :  country, but even globally as a result of the hits that you've had, to hear someone say that.
*30:25.960- 30:31.280* :  In many countries, people start out his musicians and realise they can't make money out of this,
*30:31.380- 30:35.220* :  but can you? It feels like it's been the opposite. Can you expand on that a bit more that journey?
*30:36.540- 30:43.020* :  Well, I just started a band and then become a musician who get paid.
*30:43.960- 30:48.940* :  And then every Korean male has to go to military. It's a mandatory for two years.
*30:48.940- 30:57.260* :  I've been composing for mostly pop songs and after the military. I don't want to do more pop songs.
*30:57.260- 31:03.800* :  I want to make more serious, deep music. Mr. Bong just recognised me. Mr. Bong Junho,
*31:03.800- 31:12.040* :  who is the director of Parasite. He was an executive producer of a film called SeaFog.
*31:12.040- 31:18.880* :  That was the first film I composed and then moved to Okja, a Netflix film.
*31:18.880- 31:28.200* :  And while I was doing Okja, this is very exciting and I can express all kinds of genre and all kinds
*31:28.200- 31:36.040* :  of feelings, very deep feelings, happiness, despair, sorrow, everything. This is very exciting for
*31:36.540- 31:39.560* :  composer, so I just fell in love with film scoring.
*31:51.380- 31:56.200* :  South Korean composer, producer and music director Jung Jae-il.
*31:59.200- 32:04.300* :  And that's all for us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*32:05.040- 32:10.080* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*32:10.080- 32:18.240* :  The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk. This edition was mixed by Ethan Connelly Forster
*32:18.700- 32:26.320* :  and the producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nigel Adely. Until next time, goodbye.
