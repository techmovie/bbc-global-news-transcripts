*00:52.180- 00:55.760* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*00:55.760- 00:59.700* :  We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 10th of October.
*01:00.160- 01:05.180* :  UN agencies have expressed concern over Israel's siege of Gaza, warning it's illegal to deprive
*01:05.180- 01:06.820* :  the population of vital supplies.
*01:07.440- 01:13.600* :  Israel says it's recovered the bodies of 1,500 Hamas fighters, meaning the total death toll has
*01:13.600- 01:19.280* :  passed 3,000. And three days after the invasion began, Israel says it's finally regained control
*01:19.280- 01:20.740* :  of the territory around Gaza.
*01:23.720- 01:24.640* :  Also in the podcast.
*01:24.640- 01:29.300* :  When we consider that 9 out of 10 of our medicines come from plants, what we're potentially
*01:29.300- 01:33.500* :  staring down the barrel of is losing up to half of all of our future medicines.
*01:33.500- 01:38.520* :  A warning that 45% of the world's known flowering plants could face extinction.
*01:39.200- 01:43.000* :  The pioneering mouth guard that could help solve rugby's concussion problem.
*01:43.560- 01:48.880* :  And he was, in his own words, a man would be happy with a grilled cheese and tomato soup.
*01:48.880- 01:54.640* :  The modest lifestyle of the Irish-American philanthropist Chuck Fini, who's died at the age of 92.
*02:00.000- 02:04.380* :  Footage of the attacks in southern Israel over the weekend has already highlighted the brutality
*02:04.380- 02:09.340* :  of the Hamas gunman. But now we're getting more of an idea of the ferocity of the battles between
*02:09.340- 02:12.140* :  the Israeli security forces and the Palestinian fighters.
*02:18.420- 02:23.180* :  Video released by the Israeli police of an operation to rescue wounded soldiers under heavy
*02:23.180- 02:28.380* :  fire near the cabuts of near arm. The Israeli military say they've now recovered the bodies
*02:28.380- 02:36.500* :  of 1,500 Hamas gunman inside Israel, meaning the total number killed, reported from all sides,
*02:36.500- 02:42.300* :  is approaching 3,300. A thousand murdered in the initial assault on Israel,
*02:42.300- 02:48.540* :  according to the Israeli embassy in the U.S., 770 Palestinians killed by Israeli attacks on Gaza,
*02:48.540- 02:54.860* :  and a further 17 in clashes with Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank. Three days after
*02:54.860- 02:59.560* :  the start of the Hamas attack, Israel says it has now regained control of its territory.
*03:03.840- 03:08.660* :  The idea is in full control of the region surrounding Gaza. There were no infiltrations of
*03:08.660- 03:14.400* :  terrorists overnight, as far as we know. We have created an iron wall of tanks, helicopters,
*03:14.420- 03:19.920* :  aircrafts, and our policy is to shoot to kill anyone who approaches the fence on the border.
*03:21.500- 03:24.540* :  Daniel Agari spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces,
*03:24.700- 03:29.620* :  our correspondent Dan Johnson reports now on what the latest phase of this long-running conflict
*03:29.620- 03:32.060* :  means for the people in Gaza and Israel.
*03:37.980- 03:40.860* :  Gaza pounded again by Israeli air strikes.
*03:43.820- 03:49.040* :  Right across this land, people have, for decades, known more war than peace.
*03:51.140- 03:55.400* :  But the destruction and bloodshed is now at levels they can barely comprehend.
*03:58.920- 04:04.420* :  It's difficult to reach people in Gaza, but videos show them scrambling to find survivors,
*04:05.120- 04:08.740* :  and Palestinian voices are making it out through social media.
*04:12.180- 04:17.980* :  We will struggle and our people will continue to fight until their homeland is restored,
*04:17.980- 04:22.020* :  says Khalil Salman, shouting from the ruins of his home.
*04:22.760- 04:28.400* :  We will sacrifice our children, he says, our homes, our blood, and our bodies.
*04:30.280- 04:35.300* :  The deaths are mounting on both sides, and the people of Gaza have been warned this is just the
*04:35.300- 04:42.280* :  beginning. Israel wants a complete siege, cutting off food, fuel, electricity, and water supplies
*04:42.280- 04:47.360* :  to more than two million. Those working to preserve life in this tiny strip of land,
*04:47.360- 04:54.260* :  are deeply worried. We managed to contact Mahmoud Shalabi, who's in Gaza, leading a team from
*04:54.260- 05:00.640* :  medical aid for Palestinians. Right now, the situation is crazy, the frequency of bombardments,
*05:00.820- 05:09.540* :  and the targeting of mosques, of markets, of houses without even warning is really horrific.
*05:10.420- 05:15.200* :  I'm afraid that the worst is yet to come. The health system is collapsing, and inside the hospitals,
*05:15.200- 05:20.380* :  when I spoke to some of the doctors at the beginning of the escalation, they told me that
*05:20.380- 05:26.460* :  it's a slaughterhouse, but is where all over the ground. We are expecting something worse to happen,
*05:26.640- 05:27.880* :  and we are all afraid.
*05:31.660- 05:37.980* :  There is fear across Israel too. Rockets are still heading the other way, and more bodies are being
*05:37.980- 05:48.220* :  discovered. It's people don't know what's to come next either. Those are the air raid
*05:48.220- 05:55.440* :  sirens now sounding across Jerusalem. This is now happening more and more, and it's happening
*05:55.460- 06:02.300* :  right across the country. 300,000 Israeli reserve soldiers have been called up,
*06:02.300- 06:07.600* :  more on Noonberg. There's just made the switch from husband and father to army medic.
*06:07.800- 06:12.480* :  You feel but shocked, slightly overwhelmed, and as a parent, I have to find a way to explain to
*06:12.480- 06:16.560* :  the kids why everybody's agitated. A few personal friends who are frontline fighters,
*06:17.160- 06:21.260* :  the minute they heard of the attack, they already had a bag ready, and they were just sitting next
*06:21.260- 06:25.320* :  look ready to go. You know there is a war coming, you have a part to do, step up.
*06:28.420- 06:34.660* :  Thunderstorms now replaced the sound of rockets, even if only briefly, and there is a sense that
*06:34.660- 06:41.620* :  after so many repeated cycles of violence and failed peace plans, whatever happens next,
*06:42.140- 06:45.660* :  whatever the outcome, this will be a defining moment.
*06:46.640- 06:52.780* :  A report from Dan Johnson in Jerusalem. The Israeli air strikes on Gaza have continued despite
*06:52.780- 06:57.800* :  threats by Hamas to execute Israeli hostages. The UN rights chief has said civilians
*06:57.800- 07:03.500* :  must never be used as bargaining chips. UN agencies have also expressed concern over Israel's
*07:03.500- 07:08.180* :  imposition of a total siege on Gaza, saying it could amount to collective punishment
*07:08.180- 07:13.880* :  and be illegal onto international law. Israel has said Hamas fighters have nowhere to hide
*07:13.880- 07:19.160* :  in the territory, but the civilian population there is also finding it difficult to seek shelter,
*07:19.560- 07:25.120* :  given how densely populated it is, and the ferocity of the air attacks with a thousand tons
*07:25.120- 07:30.320* :  of bombs dropped already. A spokeswoman for the UN Relief Agency for Palestinian refugees,
*07:30.320- 07:36.760* :  Tamara Al-Rifi, spoke to Rob Young. The air strikes continued overnight and with
*07:36.760- 07:43.620* :  them mass displacement of people who are running for their lives or people who are looking for
*07:43.620- 07:49.760* :  somewhere safer to stay, and that somewhere safer is mostly unruly schools. Our schools,
*07:49.860- 07:59.000* :  the schools of the UN Agency for Palestine refugees, received up to 137,000 internally displaced
*07:59.000- 08:05.740* :  people as of last night. So 83 of our schools that usually have classrooms and children
*08:06.360- 08:11.980* :  have now become shelters where conditions are very difficult because of the overcrowding already,
*08:12.020- 08:18.580* :  and because of the limited availability of clean drinking water in addition to other supplies.
*08:18.580- 08:25.440* :  So the situation is very difficult, and 18 of our own buildings have been partially damaged
*08:25.440- 08:30.840* :  during the military activities of the last couple of days. One presumes the Israelis now where
*08:30.840- 08:37.840* :  your schools are. We share the GPS of all our buildings in any conflict, so the one in Gaza and
*08:37.840- 08:43.640* :  everywhere else we work with all the parties, yes. You've got 137,000 people who are sheltering
*08:43.640- 08:48.800* :  in your 83 schools. Do you expect more people to turn to you for help, given that
*08:48.860- 08:53.740* :  Israel's Defence Minister has ordered a complete siege, which would mean that no food, fuel,
*08:53.740- 09:00.760* :  or water would be allowed into Gaza? Yes, unfortunately we expect more people to leave their homes
*09:00.800- 09:07.060* :  and come to shelter in our schools, so we expect the figure to increase, which will cause a lot
*09:07.060- 09:14.000* :  of pressure on our ability to respond to their needs. Many of our schools at UNERWA
*09:14.560- 09:21.660* :  are already prepared to become shelters as we operate in fragile contacts where conflicts can't
*09:21.660- 09:27.760* :  flare up at any moment. However, it takes a lot to turn a school into an actual shelter for more
*09:27.760- 09:32.880* :  than a few days. We're talking about access to clean drinking water, which is already scarce.
*09:32.880- 09:38.860* :  In Gaza, we're also talking about mobile toilets and bathrooms, and we're talking about
*09:38.860- 09:46.720* :  distribution of food and bare necessities such as mattresses and jerry cans and cleaning utensils,
*09:47.160- 09:53.620* :  so this is a huge humanitarian operation to put in place while the air strikes and the conflict
*09:53.620- 10:00.920* :  itself is ongoing. How long do you think there is food underwater for? We usually have in place
*10:00.920- 10:08.780* :  enough food water, but also fuel for about 10 days, so we will now work with our UN partners
*10:08.780- 10:15.040* :  through our stocks and theirs. When Israel says it is ordering a complete siege of the Gaza
*10:15.040- 10:19.740* :  strip, is it your understanding that would include that even the United Nations would not be allowed
*10:19.740- 10:27.560* :  to resupply its own facilities? This is subject to discussions now as the UN and the humanitarian
*10:27.560- 10:34.620* :  community in general always presumes that access of humanitarians and humanitarian supplies
*10:34.620- 10:40.860* :  would be spared, but this is something that we will be looking at very seriously in the days to come.
*10:41.520- 10:47.800* :  UN works and relief coordinator in Gaza, Tamara Al-Refi. Well, as well as launching air strikes on
*10:47.800- 10:52.760* :  Gaza, there have been strong hints that Israel is planning to mount a ground invasion, with the
*10:52.760- 10:57.620* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying Israel's response would, quote, change the Middle East.
*10:57.860- 11:03.100* :  Colin Clark is from the Security Think Tank, the Sufan Group. Rob Young asked him about the
*11:03.100- 11:08.800* :  challenges of putting Israeli boots on the ground in Gaza. Given the pressure of the videos we've
*11:08.800- 11:14.660* :  seen coming out of Israel, there's going to be a real groundswell of pressure among policymakers,
*11:14.740- 11:21.400* :  among the Israeli public to do something definitive here and to not only get the hostages back,
*11:21.400- 11:27.300* :  but to attempt to deal a crippling blow to Hamas. And that's only possible if the Israelis actually
*11:27.300- 11:32.960* :  go in with a large-scale ground invasion. I think it could actually go far beyond that and become
*11:32.960- 11:37.260* :  a full-blown occupation again. And how long is that likely to last?
*11:37.640- 11:42.300* :  And definitely, you know, you're talking about a densely populated area with two million people.
*11:42.300- 11:48.680* :  Clearly, Hamas is dug in and entrenched and has no shortage of weaponry. So, you know, you're
*11:48.680- 11:54.700* :  talking about an operation that could last weeks, if not months. And presumably, a Hamas would have
*11:54.700- 12:00.020* :  been preparing for the possibility of a ground assault by Israeli forces.
*12:00.280- 12:05.520* :  Exactly. Particularly, if you think about Hamas' network of subterranean tunnels, this is
*12:05.520- 12:11.320* :  something that Hamas is known for, that they would have been preparing for for quite some time.
*12:11.720- 12:15.980* :  These tunnels are likely to be booby-trapped. They present a really, really complex
*12:16.740- 12:21.280* :  operational scenario for the Israelis. And I should say, the IDF is among the most
*12:21.280- 12:27.080* :  talented and effective militaries of the world, but even for the IDF operating in their backyard,
*12:27.080- 12:28.860* :  this is going to be an immense challenge.
*12:29.100- 12:32.940* :  We've talked about the Airstrikes and fighting on the ground, but you're saying
*12:32.940- 12:36.820* :  they would also have to be fighting underground in the tunnels that Hamas have been digging.
*12:37.180- 12:42.100* :  Yeah, without question. And clearing tunnels is a nightmare scenario for the soldiers that are
*12:42.100- 12:46.800* :  doing it. Like the urban warfare that takes place on the surface, it's a slow and methodical
*12:46.800- 12:52.580* :  process. That's going to include ground mobile drones, what we call uncrewed ground vehicles,
*12:52.580- 12:57.240* :  essentially robots, and other intelligence assets that have to map these tunnels,
*12:57.240- 13:01.600* :  identify booby-trapped before soldiers can be sent in there to clear them.
*13:01.940- 13:06.940* :  So you're saying that the Israeli forces would be able to take control of Gaza,
*13:07.560- 13:09.680* :  but it would come at a high price for Israelis.
*13:10.140- 13:14.100* :  And it's no guarantee. I mean, it's no fee to complete that the Israelis could actually gain
*13:14.100- 13:19.300* :  control of Gaza. It depends what other actors jump into the fray. If there is a multi-front
*13:19.300- 13:23.620* :  conflict here with Hezbollah opening up, if things happen in the Golan Heights,
*13:23.620- 13:30.380* :  if the Iranians decide to dedicate more assets, Syria, and Iranian-back militias operating there,
*13:30.880- 13:34.980* :  or another issue, and then you've got Iranian proxies throughout the region. You've got
*13:34.980- 13:39.880* :  Iranian-backed Shia militia in Iraq. You've got the Houthis in Yemen. There's all sorts of ways
*13:40.400- 13:45.560* :  the Iranians can put pressure on Israel as Israel's attempting to wipe out Hamas and Gaza.
*13:45.980- 13:52.620* :  And as Israel attempts to eliminate Hamas as Benjamin Netanyahu said he intends to do,
*13:53.160- 13:57.940* :  what is the impact likely to be on Gazans who are not in Hamas?
*13:58.380- 14:02.980* :  Well, it's going to be horrifying. The amount of civilians and the potential collateral
*14:03.140- 14:10.380* :  is going to be extremely hard to sit back and watch. I mean, just as one warns for all the
*14:10.380- 14:15.720* :  innocent Israelis that have been killed over the past several days, one also must mourn for the
*14:15.720- 14:21.220* :  innocent Palestinian civilians that are likely now going to be essentially collateral damage
*14:21.220- 14:29.340* :  in any Israeli assault on Gaza. He said that Israel is likely to be occupying Gaza indefinitely.
*14:29.340- 14:35.200* :  Is Israel prepared for that? I don't know. It's not something that the Israelis would want to do,
*14:35.200- 14:40.380* :  but I think the paradigm has changed. Netanyahu feels like his back is against a wall,
*14:40.420- 14:45.320* :  and that this could be the only option beforehand. Time will tell, but that's certainly one of the
*14:45.320- 14:49.740* :  options that I would have to imagine is being discussed in the higher reaches of the Israeli
*14:49.740- 14:55.600* :  government and military right now. Colin Clark of the Sufan Group. The United States' Israel's
*14:55.600- 15:01.080* :  most important ally has promised aid and support, but there are complications. Extra military
*15:01.080- 15:06.020* :  assistance could be held up because the U.S. House of Representatives isn't functioning at the moment
*15:06.020- 15:11.380* :  after the vote to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. There's also a lack of U.S. diplomatic presence
*15:11.380- 15:16.880* :  on the ground in the Middle East. Robbie Gramer is the National Security reporter for Foreign
*15:16.880- 15:21.440* :  Policy magazine. He spoke to Charlotte Gallagher. It comes as part of the administration's
*15:21.600- 15:26.920* :  own efforts to focus more in China first and on Russia and Ukraine. So it's led its Middle
*15:26.920- 15:32.020* :  East policy fall by the wayside a bit, and that in combination with some really unprecedented
*15:32.020- 15:38.940* :  blockades on senior national security nominees by a handful of Republican senators have left a
*15:38.940- 15:45.540* :  really thin bench for Biden to respond to the crisis with. There's no U.S. Ambassador to Israel,
*15:45.540- 15:51.560* :  no U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Amon Kuwait, no top state department counterterrorism envoy for nearly
*15:51.560- 15:56.420* :  two years, no top U.S. aid official for the Middle East for nearly three years. These are
*15:56.420- 16:01.260* :  positions that are filled by lower ranking acting officials. Just don't have the cloud
*16:01.260- 16:05.880* :  ground toss and access to help deal with the crisis in the same way of a seasoned,
*16:05.880- 16:12.620* :  presidentially appointed ambassador. Joe Biden has pledged this aid to Israel, but it's not
*16:12.620- 16:17.320* :  synthesized it. It's complicated. There is a tranche of money through something called
*16:17.320- 16:22.560* :  presidential drawdown authority where we can basically give some old equipment sitting and
*16:22.560- 16:27.460* :  collecting dust to Israel, and that isn't quick and easy short-term solution. But again,
*16:27.460- 16:31.960* :  coming back to the political turmoil in Washington, this is really going to affect this crisis
*16:32.320- 16:37.060* :  response with no speaker of the House as the Republicans can't decide on a speaker. They could
*16:37.060- 16:41.480* :  decide as soon as Wednesday, but we're really an unprecedented territory here because we need to
*16:41.480- 16:47.060* :  house side to approve the types of funding packages necessary for the United States to ship what
*16:47.060- 16:52.460* :  it needs to Israel, and it's really difficult to do without a speaker in place. There must be a lot
*16:52.460- 16:58.080* :  of frustration in Washington and wider areas as well about this pause on activity and nothing happening.
*16:58.360- 17:02.660* :  I think what's really significant is there's frustration on the Republican and the Democratic
*17:02.660- 17:07.760* :  side alike. So what you're seeing is a lot of Republican senators coming out and saying,
*17:07.760- 17:13.200* :  okay, enough is enough. We really need to get our app together. We need that host to elect a speaker.
*17:13.680- 17:17.580* :  This crisis in Israel after these really gruesome terrorist attacks are going to add a lot of
*17:17.580- 17:22.040* :  pressure to the Republican caucus to finally elect a House speaker to push through a lot of these
*17:22.040- 17:26.260* :  nominees that have just been log jammed in the Senate and really try to get people out there.
*17:26.360- 17:30.460* :  But it's going to take a while. It's not like flipping a switch. The American politics is always
*17:30.460- 17:37.180* :  messy. U.S. National Security Reporter Robbie Graemer. Remarkable stories of escape and
*17:37.180- 17:41.900* :  of rescue against the odds are continuing to emerge after the Hamas attacks which began on Saturday.
*17:41.900- 17:47.620* :  Amir Taibon is a diplomatic correspondent for the R.E.T. newspaper. He and his family live in a
*17:47.620- 17:52.660* :  kibbutz close to the border with Gaza. He's been telling Julian Warriker about his experience.
*17:52.660- 17:58.100* :  We woke up from the sound of a whistle that signals more there is about to land near our home.
*17:58.200- 18:03.460* :  We were in bed, our two daughters three years old and one year old were in the safe room in every
*18:03.860- 18:07.880* :  home in our community and other border communities. There is a room that is built of very
*18:07.880- 18:11.820* :  strong concrete and usually most families that's where you put the kids to bed at night.
*18:12.040- 18:16.180* :  And so we ran from our bedroom to the safe room where our two daughters were sleeping.
*18:16.180- 18:21.100* :  We locked ourselves in. We were not very excited about it. We are used to this. It's part of the
*18:21.100- 18:25.900* :  reality of living on the border. But while we were barricaded inside we started hearing the noise
*18:25.900- 18:32.220* :  of automatic gunfire first in a distance and then very close and eventually right outside our window.
*18:32.460- 18:37.120* :  And that's when we realized that the Hamas terrorists were not shooting rockets at us from Gaza
*18:37.400- 18:42.860* :  this time. They were inside our community outside our window while we are barricaded with our two
*18:42.860- 18:47.280* :  young daughters inside. Did they try to get into your house at that point? Yes, they tried to get
*18:47.280- 18:52.760* :  into the house. They shot a lot of rounds into our house. Unfortunately to many other homes,
*18:52.760- 18:58.720* :  people were able to break in. Some of our neighbors were killed injured kidnaps. We were locked
*18:58.720- 19:03.900* :  inside for 10 hours in the dark with no food and we were waiting. We were waiting for a rescue.
*19:04.580- 19:09.480* :  How are your young children at this point? We told them right from the start you have to be quiet.
*19:10.040- 19:15.760* :  No noises, no speaking because there are bad people outside and they listened. They were so mature.
*19:16.260- 19:21.400* :  They couldn't see us in the dark and yet they understood from the energy that we exhibited
*19:21.540- 19:27.700* :  that this was serious. Tell me about the moment where you were able to get out of that room and
*19:27.700- 19:32.340* :  what happened to enable you to do that. When we had cell reception in the morning, I texted my
*19:32.340- 19:38.580* :  father. My father is a retired general in the Israeli military. He's 62 years old and he said he's
*19:38.580- 19:42.460* :  coming. We had no idea what this means. How is it going to come here? What is it going to do?
*19:42.460- 19:47.080* :  But I told myself right now I'm asking my two young daughters to put their faith in me and to
*19:47.080- 19:52.880* :  believe me. And I told myself just like I'm asking them to trust me, I need to trust my father.
*19:53.220- 19:57.560* :  My parents embarked on a crazy journey from Tel Aviv toward the border area. Along the way,
*19:57.560- 20:02.540* :  they saved people. They saw people who were running away barefoot from a music festival where
*20:02.540- 20:07.100* :  Hamas had committed a massacre. They put those people in their car and took them to safety.
*20:07.420- 20:12.320* :  And from there, my father embarked toward our community with one soldier, a very brave man who
*20:12.320- 20:15.860* :  agreed to accompany him because my father only had a pistol. He's retired. He didn't have
*20:15.860- 20:20.660* :  military equipment. They saw in real time a military jeep being ambushed by a Hamas cell. Several
*20:20.660- 20:25.100* :  soldiers were killed in that ambush and two were very badly wounded. And so my father
*20:25.100- 20:29.780* :  already so close to our home turned around, put the injured soldiers in his car and
*20:29.780- 20:34.760* :  took them to where my mother was waiting. My mother took the wounded soldiers to a hospital
*20:34.760- 20:39.780* :  and my father asked a friend that he knew to take him to my community. They arrived to the entrance
*20:39.780- 20:43.340* :  of the Kibuts. They met there a group of soldiers. There were hundreds of people in our community
*20:43.340- 20:48.080* :  stranded in safe rooms like ours. My father joined this group of very impressive soldiers.
*20:48.080- 20:52.920* :  They recognized him. And so they started going from home to home in the community. They killed
*20:52.920- 20:57.660* :  six terrorists. They freed dozens of people. We heard the exchange of fire. And that's when I
*20:57.660- 21:04.280* :  told my wife that he's on his way, that he's coming. And at 4 p.m. this is now 10 hours that we are
*21:04.280- 21:11.940* :  stranded. We heard a bang on the window of the safe room and my father's voice. And then my daughter
*21:11.940- 21:16.940* :  Galia, three and a half years old, said grandfather is here. And we all just started crying.
*21:17.820- 21:22.120* :  We told them all the time that he was coming because toward the end they just wanted to get out.
*21:22.120- 21:27.500* :  They couldn't stand it anymore. And the one thing that kept them focused was our promise that
*21:27.500- 21:31.540* :  their grandfather is on the way and he will open the door for us. This event is the biggest
*21:31.540- 21:37.800* :  failure in the history of this country. And we will have to deal with the criminal and corrupt
*21:37.800- 21:42.340* :  politicians who are responsible for it. But right now there are so many stories of heroism.
*21:42.860- 21:47.460* :  And I'm very proud of what my father did for us but also for so many other people. And I'm
*21:47.460- 21:51.400* :  most proud more than anything in the world of my two daughters for how they dealt with this.
*21:51.800- 21:55.780* :  Now we're going to tie bond on how he and his family survived the Hamas attack on their
*21:55.780- 22:03.900* :  kabuts on Saturday. Now do you have questions about the crisis in the Middle East? Well if so my
*22:03.900- 22:09.140* :  colleague Jackie Leonard will try to find answers. The fast moving events in Israel and Gaza have
*22:09.140- 22:13.900* :  prompted many of you to get in touch with your questions. How do we get here? What's at the root
*22:13.900- 22:19.220* :  of the conflict? What are both sides saying? What happens next? And what role does the rest of the
*22:19.220- 22:23.340* :  world have to play? We hope to answer as many of your questions as possible
*22:23.340- 22:29.140* :  in a special global news podcast coming soon. As ever send us an email or voice message
*22:29.140- 22:33.960* :  to globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk
*22:43.480- 22:48.020* :  Nearly 30 people including children have been killed in an attack on a camp housing
*22:48.020- 22:52.700* :  displaced people in northern Myanmar. It's been described as one of the deadliest strikes on
*22:52.700- 22:58.120* :  civilian since the return of military rule to Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The camp is located
*22:58.120- 23:02.940* :  close to the headquarters of the Kachin Independence Army, an insurgent group that's been fighting
*23:02.940- 23:07.560* :  the military junta for decades. I heard more from our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan
*23:07.560- 23:12.200* :  Head. This is an area which is very accustomed to attacks going way back before the coup,
*23:12.480- 23:17.660* :  a long ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army and the Myanmar military ended way back in 2011
*23:17.780- 23:23.480* :  and so there's been pretty on-off but quite heavy fighting since then. This particular camp is
*23:23.780- 23:28.100* :  quite close to Liza. That's the headquarters of the Kachin Independence Army right on the Chinese
*23:28.100- 23:32.440* :  border and I've been there before I know where these camps are. They're very crowded. So these are
*23:32.440- 23:36.820* :  people who've been displaced often many many years ago and been living in the camps. The populations
*23:36.820- 23:41.560* :  go up and down according to whether people leave or not. Houses or huts built very close together.
*23:42.020- 23:46.340* :  People often living in 18 commonly. I'm not sure what the population is right now. It has peaked
*23:46.340- 23:51.100* :  at sometimes two or three thousand. In the past sometimes it's been a few hundred. Certainly anyone
*23:51.100- 23:55.820* :  attacking it would know that there will be very significant civilian casualties. And do we know
*23:55.820- 24:00.260* :  who might have carried out this attack and indeed whether it was deliberate? Well the Myanmar
*24:00.260- 24:05.900* :  military government has said it didn't but they've said that before and it's not really plausible
*24:05.940- 24:10.780* :  that anybody else could have carried it out. The other thing about it is the Kachin Independence
*24:10.780- 24:16.660* :  officials there are describing very powerful explosions and the video that we've seen that they've
*24:16.660- 24:21.300* :  posted in the aftermath the attack shows really substantial destruction much more than we used to
*24:21.300- 24:24.920* :  see when there's occasional shelling or mortar rounds coming which is what these people would have
*24:24.920- 24:29.600* :  been used to. As it happened at midnight and they seem to have hit right in the center of the camp
*24:29.600- 24:35.160* :  I think their thinking is it may well have been an airstrike. The Myanmar military has precision
*24:35.160- 24:40.600* :  guided bombs now. It used them and attacked exactly a year ago on another Kachin base where they were
*24:40.600- 24:44.940* :  holding a concert. Just two bombs going in in the middle of the night causing absolute devastation
*24:44.940- 24:50.120* :  that attack killed 80 people. So it's quite likely that this is a similar kind of attack. We
*24:50.120- 24:54.980* :  saw an aerial attack on a village earlier this year and another part of Myanmar which killed more
*24:54.980- 24:59.400* :  than 170 people and human rights groups believe that in that one the Myanmar military might have
*24:59.400- 25:03.360* :  used what's known as a thermobaric bomb which causes immense destruction. We don't know who
*25:03.360- 25:07.980* :  carried out the attack but it's almost certainly some branch of the Myanmar Armed Forces and it looks
*25:07.980- 25:14.040* :  like an airstrike at the stage. A southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. Here in the UK a
*25:14.060- 25:19.140* :  study by the Royal Botanic Gardens at Q has found that nearly half of the world's known flowering
*25:19.140- 25:25.380* :  plants could face extinction mainly through habitat loss. The scientists say some 100,000
*25:25.380- 25:32.180* :  species are under threat including orchids, pineapples and grain crops. Dr Matilda Brown from Q
*25:32.180- 25:35.580* :  warns the effects of losing plants could be far reaching.
*25:35.920- 25:39.680* :  Plants are what we wear, they're what we eat, they're what we build with, they produce the air
*25:39.680- 25:45.060* :  we breathe. Plants underpin every aspect of life. When we consider that nine out of ten of our
*25:45.060- 25:49.780* :  medicines come from plants what we're potentially staring down the barrel of is losing up to half
*25:49.780- 25:54.620* :  of all of our future medicines. Nick Robinson heard more from our environment and rural affairs
*25:54.620- 26:00.700* :  correspondent Claire Marshall. I went into the tropical palm house at Q guns so I crashed down with
*26:00.700- 26:05.220* :  a scientist and I looked at this little plant she shaved me it just these glossy green leaves and
*26:05.220- 26:10.460* :  little dainty pink flower and it didn't look like much and most people were walking by and she
*26:10.460- 26:14.920* :  explained that this was the Madagascan Periwinkle and it was actually one of the most important
*26:15.700- 26:20.200* :  compounds in the drugs and the fight against cancer and it would have saved thousands of lives so
*26:20.200- 26:24.700* :  just this little plant that everyone was walking by and it was a perfect illustration of what the
*26:24.720- 26:29.640* :  scientists have found out that nearly half as you say of the world's flowering plants are facing
*26:29.640- 26:34.100* :  extinction. What's even worse is the ones that we don't even know about the ones that have yet
*26:34.100- 26:39.000* :  to be collected by botanists in the field and studied almost three quarters of those are threatened
*26:39.000- 26:44.280* :  with extinction so it's pretty bleak news. And how are they making these calculations? This is
*26:44.280- 26:49.900* :  on assumptions is it of the speed of which the climate will heat up. The climate change bit of this
*26:49.900- 26:55.840* :  is actually much harder to estimate. They are looking at habitat loss mainly. The impacts of climate
*26:55.840- 27:00.420* :  change are very hard to see from satellites which is how they're gathering a lot of the data.
*27:00.800- 27:04.460* :  It's a really interesting story how they're making these projections. They're using something
*27:04.460- 27:10.100* :  called Darwin's Dream which is the publication of the most comprehensive list of plants actually
*27:10.100- 27:14.340* :  ever produced so you can actually go online and see that at the moment. It's called the World
*27:14.340- 27:19.720* :  Check List of Vascular Plant. That has been published Darwin foretold it and wanted it to be
*27:19.720- 27:26.060* :  published 160 years ago but looking at that and overlaying it with the red list of threatened plants
*27:26.520- 27:31.620* :  this is the horrific conclusion that scientists have come to but one positive element to come from
*27:31.620- 27:36.340* :  it is they looked at the world of fungi and actually what they found out is there's 2.5
*27:36.620- 27:42.260* :  million species and 90% of these we don't know what they do yet and what their powers are
*27:42.600- 27:47.840* :  and the key to fighting climate change or to other medicines could be in the fungal kingdom
*27:47.840- 27:53.240* :  that we know so little about. Clamarshall. World Rugby has said it will begin using
*27:53.240- 27:57.660* :  mouth guards that can be monitored to determine whether players have suffered concussions.
*27:58.460- 28:02.920* :  Sensors in the mouth guards measure the G force of every head impact and the data is then
*28:02.920- 28:07.540* :  transmitted to medical staff on the sidelines. A rugby correspondent Chris Jones explains.
*28:07.540- 28:12.800* :  Rugby Union is facing something of an existential crisis over safety with the number of former players
*28:12.800- 28:17.040* :  taking the governing bodies to court over how their brain injuries were treated during their
*28:17.040- 28:21.460* :  careers. However world rugby believe this newest development will be a game changer for the sport.
*28:21.460- 28:26.600* :  The mouth guards will be worn by players at the upcoming WXV competition and then worldwide
*28:26.600- 28:31.920* :  in the elite game from January 2024. The hope is that the mouth guards will help alert doctors
*28:31.920- 28:36.760* :  when a player has suffered a particularly high impact blow during a match while it will also be
*28:36.760- 28:42.400* :  possible to log a player's load on a short and long-term basis to inform medics as to when a
*28:42.400- 28:47.560* :  player is at more risk of brain injury. With the sport at a crossroads world rugby belief technology
*28:47.560- 28:51.500* :  will have a significant part to play in safeguarding rugby union's future.
*28:51.940- 28:57.380* :  Chris Jones. Chuck Feney, the American businessman who quietly made billions of dollars and then
*28:57.380- 29:02.540* :  gave it all away, has died at the age of 92. Forbes says he's the first person to have donated
*29:02.540- 29:07.940* :  his entire fortune during his lifetime and a Aslam looks back at his life. Chuck Feney was
*29:07.940- 29:13.280* :  born during the Great Depression to work in class parents who struggled to pay a $32 monthly
*29:13.780- 29:19.160* :  mortgage. But Feney's life changed dramatically when his business selling luxury duty-free goods
*29:19.160- 29:24.800* :  to travelers took off. He suddenly had mansions in New York London in Paris, grand yachts,
*29:24.820- 29:29.780* :  and tickets to opulent black tie dinners. But Feney said he was uncomfortable with the wealth
*29:29.780- 29:35.620* :  and lavish lifestyle. He was, in his own words, a man who'd be happy with a grilled cheese and tomato
*29:35.620- 29:42.620* :  soup. So, in 1982, he set up the Atlantic Philanthropies Foundation and spent the next four decades
*29:42.620- 29:48.640* :  giving away all his money, more than $8 billion to humanitarian causes around the world.
*29:49.500- 29:53.620* :  Feney said it was much more fun to give while you were alive than when you were dead.
*30:10.140- 30:15.340* :  Chuck Feney rarely gave interviews and preferred to stay out of the limelight. In fact, unlike
*30:15.340- 30:19.740* :  most philanthropists whose names are emblazoned on buildings and honored at banquets,
*30:20.160- 30:25.620* :  Feney donated anonymously for years, leading to him being dubbed the James Bond of Philanthropy.
*30:25.780- 30:30.700* :  He later became a public figure but continued to live a modest life in a rented
*30:30.700- 30:37.080* :  two bedroom apartment without a car and wearing a $10 watch. His giving while living philosophy
*30:37.080- 30:42.820* :  inspired other billionaires most notably Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett to redistribute
*30:42.820- 30:49.340* :  their wealth. And that was Anna Aslam on Chuck Feney who's died at the age of 92. Finally.
*31:05.480- 31:11.560* :  The unmistakable sound of the British band Coldplay, they are currently taking legal action against
*31:11.560- 31:17.060* :  their former manager over allegations of tour mismanagement. It comes just weeks after Dave Holmes
*31:17.060- 31:22.100* :  sued the group for millions in alleged unpaid commission. The details from Phoebe Hobson.
*31:22.440- 31:27.220* :  This is an incredibly bitter dispute between arguably one of the most popular bands in the world
*31:27.220- 31:32.320* :  and their former manager Dave Holmes who really saw the band reach high levels of success. He
*31:32.320- 31:39.300* :  managed the band between 2005 and 2022. Now he in August sued the band claiming that he's owed
*31:39.300- 31:44.440* :  $12 million in commission for his work relating to Coldplay's 10th and 11th studio albums which
*31:44.440- 31:48.760* :  haven't been released yet. The band, whose lead singer is Chris Martin, denied these claims
*31:48.760- 31:54.160* :  and they've now countersued Dave Holmes seeking about 17 million in damages in relation to the
*31:54.160- 31:59.000* :  tour which is called The Music of the Sphere. They say that he didn't manage the budget responsibly
*31:59.000- 32:04.120* :  that he also owed money to the American entertainment company that promotes the band's tours.
*32:04.580- 32:08.580* :  There are some random other details that they say Holmes didn't share the drop box containing
*32:08.580- 32:12.800* :  the work for the tours at any time between the two-year period when they're in the planning
*32:12.800- 32:17.220* :  stages of the tour. So it's quite complex but there's a number of allegations. The tour,
*32:17.220- 32:22.940* :  the Music of Sphere's, is huge. It's about 165 shows and the band say that Coldplay themselves
*32:22.940- 32:28.360* :  had to sink around $20 million to cover the costs from Dave Holmes alleged mismanagement.
*32:32.860- 32:36.980* :  That's all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This edition was
*32:36.980- 32:41.200* :  mixed by Chris Lovelock and produced by Nikki Barrico, the editor's Karen Martin. I'm all
*32:41.200- 32:43.000* :  over Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
