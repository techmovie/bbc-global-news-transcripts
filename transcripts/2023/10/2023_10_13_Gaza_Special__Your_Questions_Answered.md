*01:21.180- 01:25.540* :  recorded at 1730 GMT on Friday, the 13th of October,
*01:26.080- 01:27.220* :  we'll be answering your questions
*01:27.220- 01:29.020* :  about the Israeli Gaza crisis.
*01:29.700- 01:31.940* :  A week on from the Hamas attack on Israel,
*01:31.940- 01:35.000* :  we've teamed up with the new BBC podcast, The Conflict,
*01:35.300- 01:37.500* :  and a joint from Israel by its host.
*01:37.860- 01:39.280* :  Our chief international correspondent,
*01:39.280- 01:42.640* :  Lee Stussette, who is in Ash Dodd north of Gaza.
*01:43.140- 01:46.080* :  Also with us is our international editor, Jeremy Bowen,
*01:46.320- 01:47.080* :  who's in Jerusalem.
*01:47.640- 01:48.420* :  We'll be hearing too
*01:48.700- 01:51.340* :  from the BBC security correspondent, Frank Gardner.
*01:52.020- 01:54.720* :  We had planned to talk to our colleagues in Gaza,
*01:55.200- 01:58.480* :  but our apologies for now, it's just too dangerous.
*02:01.340- 02:02.140* :  Let's cross to Israel.
*02:03.060- 02:06.220* :  We have a great deal to discuss about the events in the Middle East,
*02:06.220- 02:08.920* :  how we got here, how events are unfolding on the ground,
*02:09.600- 02:11.420* :  how the international community is responding,
*02:11.500- 02:15.860* :  and how any sort of peaceful outcome might be achieved.
*02:16.460- 02:19.400* :  It's clear from your questions that you'd like us to start
*02:19.400- 02:21.660* :  with a little bit of geography and a bit of history.
*02:21.660- 02:25.820* :  So, Lee's welcome, a relatively easy one to kick off with.
*02:26.320- 02:29.040* :  Can you give us a sense of the size and location of Gaza,
*02:29.940- 02:32.100* :  where it is in relation to Israel,
*02:32.100- 02:35.040* :  who lives there, who's in charge, and who its neighbors are?
*02:35.920- 02:39.300* :  Well, the Gaza Strip is a coastal strip of land
*02:39.340- 02:40.940* :  on the Mediterranean.
*02:40.940- 02:43.480* :  The southern side is connecting to Egypt,
*02:44.060- 02:46.540* :  and then its other neighbor is Israel.
*02:46.540- 02:50.340* :  It is described as one of the most densely populated places
*02:50.340- 02:54.360* :  on Earth, some 2.3 million Palestinians live there,
*02:54.960- 02:57.760* :  and they live with great frustration because they feel
*02:57.760- 03:00.480* :  they don't really have control over their lives.
*03:00.480- 03:04.180* :  Even though Israel pulled out its troops in 2005,
*03:04.180- 03:07.880* :  it controls the airspace, it controls the sea,
*03:07.880- 03:11.280* :  it also controls all of the land crossings
*03:11.800- 03:14.660* :  into Gaza, except the one which goes to Egypt,
*03:14.660- 03:17.060* :  which is called the Ruffa Crossing.
*03:17.660- 03:21.240* :  We've tried to use various measures to say how big it is
*03:21.480- 03:23.080* :  for people who live in North America.
*03:23.660- 03:27.080* :  It's about the size of Washington, DC.
*03:27.660- 03:30.340* :  Okay, so that was the geography part.
*03:30.920- 03:32.680* :  To the more complicated part now,
*03:33.360- 03:34.680* :  what is behind this conflict?
*03:34.680- 03:35.540* :  Let's hear from a listener.
*03:36.120- 03:37.640* :  Sydney from Albany, New York.
*03:38.000- 03:40.260* :  I know very little about the history of the conflict
*03:40.260- 03:41.440* :  between the two sides.
*03:41.900- 03:44.300* :  I always grew up believing it had to do with religious differences.
*03:44.820- 03:47.920* :  I'm 24 years old and was never led to believe anything different.
*03:48.440- 03:50.300* :  I want to learn more about the history of the conflict
*03:50.300- 03:52.240* :  because I don't remember learning about it in school
*03:52.240- 03:53.940* :  and I want to be correctly informed.
*03:54.420- 03:54.960* :  And this one.
*03:55.540- 03:57.260* :  Hi, this is Lily from Germany.
*03:57.260- 04:00.400* :  I was wondering how was the state of Israel founded?
*04:00.760- 04:03.920* :  How did that impact local people in what was formerly Palestine?
*04:04.600- 04:06.460* :  Why did the following force break out?
*04:06.560- 04:08.580* :  And what is life for people
*04:08.580- 04:10.460* :  under occupation in the worst bank like?
*04:10.880- 04:14.100* :  So Jeremy, the problem here is how far back do we go?
*04:14.420- 04:16.640* :  Can you attempt a potted history force?
*04:17.800- 04:19.680* :  So I'll try it in the next minute or so.
*04:20.280- 04:22.960* :  At the first part of the question, where did the conflict start?
*04:23.740- 04:25.600* :  Well, I suppose you have to go back
*04:25.600- 04:28.420* :  to the Zionist movement in Europe,
*04:29.000- 04:31.460* :  where in 1897 they had a congress
*04:31.460- 04:33.080* :  and they decided, among other things,
*04:33.080- 04:37.200* :  that they would push to get a Jewish state within 50 years.
*04:37.200- 04:41.180* :  In fact, they got one in 51 years in 1948.
*04:41.380- 04:45.840* :  And there was even by 1897, there was settlement
*04:45.840- 04:50.020* :  by Jews who were known as Zionists.
*04:50.260- 04:52.480* :  It's a Jewish nationalism, if you like.
*04:52.480- 04:55.100* :  It was a period of nationalism in Europe.
*04:55.660- 04:57.020* :  The Czechs wanted a homeland.
*04:57.680- 04:59.440* :  The Hungarians wanted independence.
*05:00.360- 05:03.400* :  And Jews were thinking, well, let's get a nation state as well.
*05:04.040- 05:06.340* :  And they decided they wanted to have one here.
*05:06.700- 05:09.880* :  In Palestine, but there was a famous historian,
*05:09.880- 05:12.400* :  Avishlein, found this great quote,
*05:12.400- 05:16.800* :  some rabbis who came out here after that first Zionist conference.
*05:17.460- 05:19.340* :  They telegraphed back to Europe and said,
*05:19.340- 05:22.720* :  the bride is beautiful, but she's already married.
*05:23.160- 05:25.020* :  In other words, there were people here.
*05:25.600- 05:29.920* :  One of the old sayings about Israel was it was a land without a people
*05:29.920- 05:31.180* :  for a people without a land.
*05:31.240- 05:35.000* :  But that wasn't true because they were Palestinian Arabs here.
*05:35.540- 05:38.460* :  And when the Zionists were coming in to start with,
*05:38.460- 05:40.880* :  there was a bit of cooperation, but increasingly,
*05:40.940- 05:42.140* :  there was conflict.
*05:42.140- 05:45.440* :  And I think asking where this conflict came from,
*05:45.660- 05:48.460* :  I think it started off with two peoples having
*05:48.460- 05:51.980* :  a very strong claims to the land in their own minds
*05:52.700- 05:57.240* :  and not being able to agree how to split it and how to share it.
*05:57.240- 05:58.940* :  Now, the British were in charge here
*05:59.400- 06:01.240* :  between the world wars effectively.
*06:01.240- 06:02.780* :  They left in 1948.
*06:03.220- 06:07.580* :  And they did have a plan to try to split the land into two states.
*06:07.640- 06:12.460* :  But it was one which the Arabs particularly would not accept.
*06:12.580- 06:13.440* :  They wanted everything.
*06:13.440- 06:17.180* :  I think that the Jews at that time were more of a subtle approach.
*06:17.180- 06:18.840* :  And while they weren't getting what they wanted,
*06:19.280- 06:21.460* :  they thought we'll take a bit and maybe we'll have something extra.
*06:21.840- 06:24.840* :  So in 1948, Israel's war of independence,
*06:24.840- 06:26.480* :  they won a massive victory.
*06:26.480- 06:30.180* :  But since then, it has had a very troubled history.
*06:30.180- 06:32.560* :  And one of the questions was about religious differences.
*06:32.880- 06:35.940* :  Well, you know, in the time that I've been here as a journalist,
*06:36.300- 06:37.900* :  reporting for me over more than 30 years,
*06:38.420- 06:39.760* :  the conflict has got more religious.
*06:40.160- 06:43.660* :  Now, there are people on both sides who believe they are doing the will of God.
*06:44.140- 06:45.440* :  And those people were always existed,
*06:45.960- 06:48.080* :  but now they're in really powerful positions.
*06:48.080- 06:52.020* :  Well, the latest stage in the crisis started with the unprecedented attacks
*06:52.020- 06:55.380* :  on Israel by Hamas, which seemed to come as a complete surprise.
*06:55.760- 06:57.680* :  We'll talk about the why now shortly.
*06:57.680- 07:00.100* :  But first, let's have another one of your questions.
*07:00.740- 07:01.520* :  This is Katie.
*07:01.940- 07:02.760* :  I live in New York.
*07:03.980- 07:08.980* :  I want to know what life was or is like in Palestine.
*07:09.200- 07:13.000* :  And is it those harsh conditions that led to this breaking point
*07:13.520- 07:18.120* :  or did Hamas just do this because they want to eradicate Jewish people
*07:18.220- 07:18.760* :  from the earth?
*07:18.760- 07:21.720* :  And they're just using this claim of oppression
*07:21.720- 07:24.160* :  as an excuse to kill Jewish people.
*07:24.960- 07:26.340* :  So, Lise, would you like to take this one?
*07:27.300- 07:29.240* :  Well, I'll just pick up on what Jeremy said,
*07:29.240- 07:30.980* :  is that the longer this conflict goes on,
*07:30.980- 07:34.280* :  it does acquire more and more of a religious dimension.
*07:35.280- 07:40.440* :  But Muslims against the Jews and the Jewish people feel very profoundly threatened
*07:40.440- 07:44.860* :  by the attacks that Hamas carried out on Saturday.
*07:44.860- 07:48.300* :  It has gone right around the world for in Jewish communities.
*07:48.300- 07:52.140* :  But I think predominantly this is an issue about, yes,
*07:52.140- 07:56.600* :  the very difficult, impoverished conditions in Gaza.
*07:57.200- 07:59.300* :  The conditions in the occupied West Bank.
*07:59.300- 08:04.320* :  The fact that Israel continues to exercise control over people's lives.
*08:04.320- 08:08.080* :  And the fact that Israel, that the hopes of the Palestinians,
*08:08.860- 08:11.000* :  just sorry, just to interrupt you there, Lise.
*08:11.000- 08:14.240* :  We were hearing some sirens there and it sounded like some explosions.
*08:14.340- 08:15.500* :  Can you tell us what's going on?
*08:15.700- 08:17.380* :  Well, that's the third of artillery.
*08:17.380- 08:19.420* :  We're very close to the Gaza border.
*08:19.420- 08:21.060* :  So, that's outgoing.
*08:22.440- 08:25.040* :  In the night, there's a lot of intense aerial bombardment.
*08:25.040- 08:27.980* :  It goes on around the clock for gossens.
*08:28.860- 08:29.560* :  It is in the distance.
*08:30.240- 08:33.380* :  I'm afraid it is a sound that we hear all day,
*08:33.380- 08:34.920* :  even here in southern Israel.
*08:34.920- 08:37.620* :  Our artillery going out, drones in the sky,
*08:37.620- 08:39.320* :  helicopter gunships.
*08:39.620- 08:43.120* :  We hear the thud of some of that bombardment in Gaza.
*08:43.700- 08:45.260* :  We only see, for the most part,
*08:45.560- 08:46.220* :  hear the sounds.
*08:46.520- 08:49.220* :  And right here, we can't see what's happening on the ground.
*08:49.520- 08:50.220* :  Frightening moment.
*08:50.660- 08:51.240* :  It is frightening.
*08:51.240- 08:52.620* :  Are you okay to continue?
*08:53.040- 08:53.520* :  You are okay.
*08:53.680- 08:54.680* :  That's great.
*08:54.680- 08:57.320* :  Not really for us, for the people under them, for the people under them.
*08:57.580- 08:57.860* :  It is.
*08:58.200- 09:00.420* :  So, I was saying one of the most controversial issues
*09:00.880- 09:05.260* :  between the Israelis and Palestinians is the expansion of Jewish settlements.
*09:05.880- 09:07.520* :  And in the past many months,
*09:07.520- 09:10.840* :  with Benjamin Netanyahu remaining in power and now governing
*09:10.900- 09:13.700* :  with the most right-wing government in Israel's history,
*09:13.700- 09:17.500* :  it is very prosettler and there's been for most of this year.
*09:18.080- 09:20.100* :  More and more clashes, the siren is going off,
*09:20.100- 09:21.060* :  but I think we're fine.
*09:21.520- 09:22.320* :  We can continue.
*09:22.720- 09:26.060* :  And I think maybe it's good for our listeners
*09:26.280- 09:29.080* :  to know that this is the reality of life.
*09:29.800- 09:32.280* :  There's been a lot of clashes between the settlers
*09:32.700- 09:35.260* :  and Palestinians in the West Bank.
*09:35.260- 09:39.660* :  So much so that it was regarded as Israel's more focused on the West Bank
*09:39.660- 09:41.440* :  than they were on Gaza.
*09:42.140- 09:43.540* :  But there are many reasons for this.
*09:43.720- 09:44.540* :  And they are very profound.
*09:44.540- 09:45.440* :  They're very emotional.
*09:45.440- 09:47.960* :  They're historical and very personal and political.
*09:48.820- 09:52.920* :  Right, let's have another clip from one of our listeners.
*09:53.600- 09:55.620* :  Given the Israeli response to the Hamas attacks,
*09:55.620- 09:58.560* :  seemingly resulting in collective punishment towards the Palestinians,
*09:58.740- 10:03.480* :  I'm curious as to what the average Palestinian civilian sentiment is towards Hamas.
*10:04.160- 10:05.920* :  Is this an organization that is largely supported?
*10:06.480- 10:07.500* :  And that one's for you, Jeremy.
*10:08.340- 10:10.500* :  Well, there have been any polls in the last week
*10:10.600- 10:13.620* :  because I think that for a lot of Palestinians,
*10:14.480- 10:15.680* :  and one's I've spoken to,
*10:16.200- 10:19.600* :  horror and incredulity about what has been happening,
*10:19.600- 10:22.320* :  about the numbers of people that were killed.
*10:22.320- 10:24.860* :  I think people had no idea that this was coming.
*10:25.260- 10:25.980* :  So there's that.
*10:26.440- 10:27.820* :  Now, before all this happened,
*10:28.500- 10:32.360* :  Hamas took over in Gaza in 2007.
*10:32.360- 10:35.840* :  Quite violently, they kicked out the other faction, Fate.
*10:36.520- 10:39.880* :  They were a daggers drawn literally in some cases.
*10:39.880- 10:42.080* :  They had won an election the previous year.
*10:42.080- 10:43.400* :  So they were popular then.
*10:43.960- 10:46.840* :  And a lot of that was a protest vote against the ineptitude
*10:47.360- 10:50.880* :  and the corruption of the other Palestinian main group, Fate.
*10:51.160- 10:54.380* :  And the fact that they hadn't delivered their objective
*10:54.760- 10:56.600* :  of a Palestinian state and to start with,
*10:56.780- 10:59.820* :  some people thought Palestinians were quite a breath of fresh air.
*10:59.880- 11:02.660* :  But things have changed, became more authoritarian,
*11:02.820- 11:06.820* :  and they haven't been so popular in Gaza,
*11:06.820- 11:08.860* :  and also here in the West Bank.
*11:09.300- 11:11.800* :  Yes, of course, they have their followers,
*11:11.800- 11:14.900* :  some very, very dedicated followers,
*11:14.900- 11:16.760* :  often people who are religious.
*11:17.380- 11:20.800* :  But you cannot say that the Palestinian national movement,
*11:20.800- 11:22.760* :  those people who want to have their own state,
*11:22.760- 11:24.920* :  which is virtually every Palestinian I've ever met,
*11:25.520- 11:28.420* :  that they are co-extensive with Hamas,
*11:28.420- 11:31.000* :  because that's not the case, far from it.
*11:31.480- 11:35.780* :  And so Hamas were not ragingly popular group.
*11:35.900- 11:39.040* :  And I don't think this is necessarily going to make them
*11:39.040- 11:39.820* :  any more popular.
*11:39.820- 11:43.160* :  But what will happen, because what is already happening,
*11:43.820- 11:46.200* :  because the number of deaths of Palestinian civilians,
*11:47.040- 11:49.680* :  particularly, is there will be a feeling that Palestinians
*11:49.680- 11:52.920* :  and others in the Arab world, we've seen a lot of demonstrations today,
*11:53.760- 11:55.480* :  will be angry about what was happening,
*11:55.480- 12:00.540* :  and angry at Israel, because of the way that they are attacking Gaza.
*12:01.180- 12:03.640* :  Well, turning to current Israeli politics now,
*12:03.640- 12:04.840* :  let's get a bit more context.
*12:05.460- 12:08.960* :  Chris Hockman from Texas, but originally from Australia.
*12:09.360- 12:13.180* :  How much of a factor is the settlements in this situation?
*12:13.660- 12:17.100* :  How has this changed Israeli policy, given that,
*12:17.200- 12:19.960* :  to get support from the right, Netanyahu had shifted
*12:20.400- 12:22.300* :  to a more anti-Palestinian policy?
*12:23.080- 12:25.160* :  What's a runs role in all of this?
*12:25.520- 12:26.320* :  Please, take that one.
*12:27.120- 12:29.540* :  Well, I've mentioned one of the primary reasons
*12:29.540- 12:31.860* :  for the increasing anger of Palestinians,
*12:31.860- 12:33.660* :  including Hamas against Israel,
*12:33.660- 12:37.700* :  is the rise and rise expansion of Jewish settlements.
*12:38.480- 12:40.780* :  Jewish settlements was one of the issues that was postponed
*12:40.780- 12:42.960* :  in the Oslo Peace Accords of 30 years ago,
*12:42.960- 12:45.600* :  and many now realize that was a huge mistake.
*12:45.620- 12:47.900* :  They thought they would be able to deal with it.
*12:48.380- 12:51.460* :  Israel has given back some of the control of the occupied West Bank,
*12:51.460- 12:55.080* :  but there are large suites which are under Israeli control,
*12:55.080- 12:57.620* :  and the settlements continue to expand.
*12:57.620- 13:01.500* :  And also, the Israeli settlers now feel emboldened
*13:01.960- 13:03.660* :  by the right-wing government, which has many
*13:03.660- 13:08.700* :  prosettler politicians inside Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet,
*13:08.700- 13:12.000* :  at least the cabinet he had, before he formed the war cabinet.
*13:12.460- 13:13.680* :  Well, yes, it is a major issue.
*13:14.360- 13:16.700* :  On Iran, this has been asked many times.
*13:16.700- 13:20.700* :  Iran is one of the main backers of Hamas and Islamic jihad.
*13:20.700- 13:24.140* :  It both helps to arm and finance both groups,
*13:24.880- 13:28.680* :  but in this particular crisis, the United States
*13:28.680- 13:33.120* :  and Israel have both said that there is no intelligence to suggest
*13:33.760- 13:37.020* :  that Iran was part of the planning and the execution
*13:37.640- 13:39.060* :  of this assault by Hamas.
*13:39.500- 13:42.840* :  Okay, so Frank Gardner, our security correspondent, is here.
*13:43.400- 13:47.100* :  Let's take a question that we go from one of our listeners on intelligence.
*13:47.860- 13:49.740* :  I'm Alan Si from the Philippines.
*13:50.600- 13:53.060* :  With vast resources at its disposal,
*13:53.940- 13:57.600* :  how could Israel have failed to foresee the attack by Hamas?
*13:57.820- 14:00.940* :  Is this failure of intelligence really attributable
*14:00.940- 14:03.300* :  to Israel's current political climate?
*14:04.140- 14:06.580* :  Well, Alan, this is exactly the question
*14:06.580- 14:09.600* :  that a lot of Israelis are asking of their government.
*14:10.220- 14:12.540* :  And it is a failure of intelligence.
*14:12.540- 14:14.220* :  It's also a failure of imagination.
*14:15.100- 14:18.760* :  So there was always known to be a threat coming from Hamas in Gaza,
*14:19.400- 14:21.560* :  but Israel had spent about a billion dollars
*14:21.560- 14:23.260* :  building what it called its iron wall.
*14:23.260- 14:24.800* :  It relied a lot on technology.
*14:25.240- 14:28.280* :  That meant it thinned out a lot of the forces it had on that border.
*14:28.800- 14:31.060* :  It didn't think Hamas was going to attack from there.
*14:31.480- 14:32.640* :  Plus, it happened on a holiday.
*14:33.280- 14:36.500* :  And yes, you're right to some extent, the Israeli government has been distracted
*14:37.060- 14:38.460* :  by a lot of the political turmoil.
*14:38.900- 14:40.780* :  That plus the fact that most of the violence
*14:40.780- 14:44.000* :  in recent months has been in the West Bank, not in Gaza.
*14:44.700- 14:48.500* :  Alan also wanted to know if it would be in Iran's interest
*14:48.500- 14:51.460* :  to stoke conflict all over the Middle East.
*14:51.800- 14:55.120* :  Well, Iran has denied any role in this attack, but has applauded it.
*14:55.760- 14:57.660* :  Hamas is an ally of Iran.
*14:57.660- 15:01.540* :  It's funded, trained, equipped, armed by Iran.
*15:02.300- 15:06.480* :  And I think it's fair to say that there was some nervousness
*15:07.040- 15:13.760* :  in Iran and in Hamas that Saudi Arabia was about to conclude a deal with Israel
*15:13.760- 15:16.100* :  that would see the two countries normalizing their relations.
*15:16.620- 15:19.720* :  That deal is now temporarily, at least for the time being, off the table.
*15:20.380- 15:24.720* :  So Iran has definitely an interest in supporting Hamas.
*15:25.200- 15:28.960* :  And it has been accused by Western governments and Israel
*15:28.960- 15:31.040* :  of fermenting trouble in the Middle East,
*15:31.380- 15:33.400* :  fermenting violence and channeling weapons
*15:33.400- 15:36.700* :  to not just Hamas, but also to Hasbullah,
*15:36.920- 15:39.560* :  which is why Israel has been bombing airports in the last few days
*15:40.020- 15:42.820* :  in Syria to try and interrupt that weapons flow from Iran.
*15:43.400- 15:45.360* :  And quite a lot of people were also wondering about
*15:45.360- 15:48.480* :  what they see as the apparent international bias
*15:48.480- 15:50.180* :  in support of Israel.
*15:51.180- 15:53.060* :  Hello, I'm Angie, I'm from Poland.
*15:53.460- 15:57.200* :  Why are most of the people also world leaders expressing support for Israel
*15:57.200- 15:59.020* :  and accepting their military response?
*15:59.560- 16:02.880* :  From what I understand, it is the Israel that is a long time aggressor
*16:02.980- 16:04.840* :  and an occupant of the Palestinian territory.
*16:05.100- 16:08.300* :  Shouldn't more support and understanding be given to the Palestinian people?
*16:08.300- 16:11.820* :  I don't support violence in any way and would prefer a peaceful solution,
*16:12.300- 16:14.960* :  but it is not that Hamas is attacking Israel without reason.
*16:15.320- 16:18.720* :  With all the news about Israel's violence and the settlers in recent months,
*16:18.840- 16:22.760* :  I find it understandable that they see it as an only way to fight for their freedom.
*16:23.920- 16:28.260* :  Right, Angie, so this attack was unprecedented
*16:29.140- 16:34.940* :  in the ferocity and barbarism and absolutely disgusting sadism
*16:35.620- 16:37.480* :  of killing children in cold blood.
*16:37.980- 16:41.700* :  Now, yes, it's horrific what's happening in Gaza, of course it is.
*16:41.700- 16:44.320* :  And it's deeply unfair, the treatment of the Palestinians,
*16:44.320- 16:48.960* :  that their land has been continually encroached upon by settlement after settlement.
*16:48.960- 16:51.360* :  And that, of course, has led to this frustration.
*16:51.840- 16:57.680* :  But nothing excuses the total barbarity, the ISIS level of savagery
*16:58.120- 17:01.760* :  that was committed on the morning of Saturday, October the 7th,
*17:02.200- 17:04.740* :  the chasing down and gunning down in cold blood
*17:05.220- 17:07.660* :  of young people as they went to a music festival,
*17:07.660- 17:10.240* :  the murdering of grandmothers in their beds.
*17:10.860- 17:13.680* :  This is shocked, not just Israelis, but the whole world.
*17:13.680- 17:18.740* :  That's why, for the time being, the kind of moral compass of outrage
*17:18.740- 17:20.860* :  has tended to be on the side of Israel.
*17:21.260- 17:22.660* :  That I think will probably change
*17:22.660- 17:26.480* :  as more and more suffering is experienced by the people of Gaza
*17:26.960- 17:30.020* :  as Israel pummels that narrow coastal strip.
*17:30.240- 17:33.620* :  Some are wondering about what the views are more specifically
*17:34.180- 17:35.220* :  in the Middle East region.
*17:36.640- 17:39.700* :  Hi, my name is Matthew and I'm from New York.
*17:40.060- 17:44.000* :  I'm curious how neighboring Muslim countries view Hamas
*17:44.060- 17:47.000* :  and more specifically the Palestinian people.
*17:47.700- 17:52.860* :  What is Egypt's Jordan's Lebanon's or Syria's official stance on Hamas?
*17:53.680- 17:56.260* :  Are there unofficial perspectives you could discuss?
*17:57.680- 17:59.540* :  As ever in the Middle East, there is a difference
*17:59.540- 18:01.220* :  between the official stance of governments,
*18:01.220- 18:04.080* :  which is nearly always in support of the Palestinian cause.
*18:04.800- 18:07.840* :  And what the leaders of those governments actually think in practice.
*18:08.600- 18:10.160* :  Most of them don't like Hamas.
*18:10.360- 18:10.900* :  Qatar does.
*18:10.900- 18:13.960* :  Qatar provides a base for Hamas' political leadership.
*18:14.620- 18:18.280* :  But most certainly the Sunni conservative Arab governments
*18:18.280- 18:21.540* :  of Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
*18:22.280- 18:24.120* :  UAE, United Emirates and Bahrain,
*18:24.420- 18:26.100* :  they don't particularly like Hamas
*18:26.180- 18:28.060* :  because it is what's called political Islam.
*18:28.060- 18:31.420* :  It believes that religion should have a role in government
*18:31.420- 18:34.240* :  and they see that as a threat to their way of ruling.
*18:34.840- 18:38.400* :  But the conflict that's raging now is so huge
*18:38.400- 18:39.600* :  with such high casualties
*18:40.160- 18:41.680* :  that they feel obliged those governments
*18:41.680- 18:45.840* :  to all come out and support most cases the Palestinian cause.
*18:46.100- 18:48.300* :  And there's been a rare joint statement
*18:48.300- 18:51.980* :  by Saudi Arabia and Iran supporting the Palestinian cause.
*18:52.400- 18:55.480* :  And are there countries in the region sympathetic enough
*18:55.480- 18:59.000* :  and able to take in refugees from Gaza?
*18:59.620- 19:01.700* :  Well, the big question here is will Egypt do it?
*19:01.700- 19:04.420* :  Because there's enormous pressure from the United States,
*19:04.420- 19:06.960* :  from Israel, from other countries on Egypt
*19:06.960- 19:10.060* :  to open its very tiny border at Rafa
*19:10.900- 19:13.660* :  between Egypt, the north of the Egyptian Sinai
*19:14.100- 19:16.000* :  with the south end of the Gaza Strip.
*19:16.420- 19:18.980* :  Now, Garsans don't particularly want to leave their country.
*19:18.980- 19:20.620* :  I mean, you know, this is traumatic for them.
*19:20.620- 19:23.020* :  Many of them, they are descendants of people
*19:23.020- 19:25.340* :  who were kicked out of their homes back in 1948.
*19:25.840- 19:26.980* :  So they don't want to have another
*19:27.400- 19:29.360* :  what's called nukbar in Arabic catastrophe.
*19:30.120- 19:33.000* :  Egypt certainly doesn't want to host tens,
*19:33.000- 19:35.960* :  if not hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees
*19:36.660- 19:38.420* :  because they don't think it would be a temporary thing
*19:38.420- 19:41.020* :  while Israel clears out Hamas.
*19:41.360- 19:43.300* :  They think with some justification,
*19:43.480- 19:45.920* :  it'll end up being a permanent refugee camp
*19:45.980- 19:47.180* :  in the north of the Sinai.
*19:47.720- 19:50.680* :  So no, there's no appetite in the Middle East
*19:50.680- 19:52.840* :  for hosting more Palestinian refugees.
*19:52.840- 19:56.080* :  What everyone would rather see is an equitable solution.
*19:56.360- 19:57.400* :  And I'm going to end with this.
*19:58.160- 20:01.700* :  This conflict is going to go on and on in a vicious cycle
*20:02.580- 20:04.700* :  regardless of Israel's military actions
*20:05.440- 20:09.660* :  until Palestinians are ruled governed by people
*20:09.660- 20:11.960* :  who don't seek the destruction of the state of Israel
*20:11.960- 20:15.500* :  and Israel stops building settlements on Arab land
*20:15.500- 20:17.920* :  on Palestinian land that deprives them
*20:18.300- 20:20.020* :  of a future contagious homeland.
*20:20.560- 20:21.340* :  That's the bottom line.
*20:21.820- 20:23.900* :  Now, when we talk about what's going on,
*20:24.180- 20:27.560* :  people are of course really sensitive to the language
*20:28.140- 20:29.560* :  used by media organizations.
*20:29.680- 20:31.540* :  Here in the BBC, we have specific guidelines
*20:31.540- 20:34.260* :  related to our use of words like
*20:34.260- 20:35.700* :  militant and terror.
*20:36.400- 20:38.700* :  Jeremy, can you just very briefly talk us through those?
*20:39.800- 20:43.020* :  Well, the big controversial one is whether or not
*20:43.020- 20:46.880* :  at the BBC, we should refer to Hamas as terrorists.
*20:47.620- 20:51.020* :  I've been listening closely to the way that news readers
*20:51.240- 20:53.720* :  have been framing it in intros
*20:53.920- 20:55.900* :  into the reports that we've been doing.
*20:56.680- 20:59.340* :  And the form of words they've been using is that Hamas,
*20:59.440- 21:02.400* :  which is being classified as a terrorist organization
*21:02.520- 21:03.880* :  by many governments in the West,
*21:04.300- 21:05.720* :  including the United Kingdom.
*21:06.420- 21:09.600* :  At the BBC, we don't say, well, they're terrorists
*21:09.760- 21:10.840* :  or they're not terrorists.
*21:11.640- 21:12.240* :  Why is that?
*21:12.580- 21:16.020* :  It's because it's a very loaded word.
*21:16.020- 21:18.560* :  Some people say that the definitions are very simple,
*21:19.300- 21:19.880* :  but they're not.
*21:20.240- 21:22.800* :  And what we're after is clarity.
*21:22.800- 21:27.460* :  So the way I approach it is that I try and describe
*21:27.460- 21:30.100* :  what's happened and what they stand for
*21:30.100- 21:31.420* :  and what they're trying to do.
*21:32.380- 21:33.800* :  Give you another example.
*21:33.800- 21:35.460* :  There are plenty of people,
*21:36.120- 21:37.840* :  plenty of people not very far from where I'm in
*21:37.840- 21:39.340* :  in Jerusalem or in the West Bank,
*21:39.340- 21:41.020* :  who would say that Israel,
*21:41.020- 21:42.820* :  repeatedly over many years,
*21:43.300- 21:45.820* :  has been guilty of state terrorism
*21:46.600- 21:48.760* :  as far as the Palestinians and other countries
*21:48.760- 21:50.180* :  their neighbors are concerned.
*21:50.180- 21:52.600* :  Now, I don't call them a state terrorist
*21:52.780- 21:55.960* :  and we don't get into that business of using this word
*21:56.500- 21:57.540* :  because it's so controversial,
*21:57.540- 22:00.660* :  I can even feel now supporters of Israel
*22:00.660- 22:02.960* :  bridling that I even mentioned that.
*22:03.480- 22:05.280* :  I'm not trying to make comparisons.
*22:05.780- 22:08.840* :  This is not about comparisons, it's about clarity.
*22:09.300- 22:11.900* :  So what I try and do in my writing and my reporting
*22:11.980- 22:15.100* :  is I try and describe what's going on.
*22:15.200- 22:18.820* :  And for the record, I'd say that Hamas carried out
*22:18.820- 22:23.180* :  an absolutely murderous attack against innocent civilians
*22:23.760- 22:29.280* :  and the massive shock of that is having a profound effect,
*22:29.280- 22:32.380* :  not just on the fact that Israel has been
*22:32.380- 22:34.700* :  delta-naked of war and is responding.
*22:34.700- 22:38.020* :  It's also completely upset what people believed
*22:38.020- 22:39.660* :  was the status quo.
*22:40.180- 22:41.200* :  And now in the Middle East,
*22:41.200- 22:44.920* :  they are into a terrible new period of uncertainty
*22:44.920- 22:48.560* :  because what happens the day after Israel finishes
*22:48.940- 22:50.100* :  its military operation?
*22:50.280- 22:52.300* :  What kind of governance will be left there?
*22:52.540- 22:54.400* :  That's the kind of things we want to look at
*22:54.720- 22:57.440* :  but instead people who oppose what we do in London
*22:57.440- 22:58.860* :  are very critical of the BBC.
*22:59.260- 23:02.160* :  Have been using this as a reason to have a go at us
*23:02.160- 23:04.940* :  and I think that actually what we're after is accuracy.
*23:05.480- 23:07.540* :  Well, listeners do care about language.
*23:07.540- 23:09.040* :  Let's hear from a couple more.
*23:09.760- 23:11.240* :  Hello, Global News Podcast.
*23:11.420- 23:14.580* :  I'm Anne from Arlington, Virginia in the US.
*23:15.500- 23:19.240* :  Despite the brutal Hamas attacks we all watch
*23:19.580- 23:20.940* :  on every news outlet,
*23:21.660- 23:24.800* :  the word siege still sounds barbaric
*23:25.400- 23:27.640* :  and is something one reads in the history books.
*23:28.620- 23:32.080* :  What does a total siege mean in the 21st century?
*23:32.680- 23:35.900* :  Also, by waging siege warfare
*23:35.900- 23:38.060* :  or pledging support for one,
*23:38.840- 23:42.140* :  what human cost must leader be willing to incur?
*23:43.220- 23:48.460* :  My name is Keith Slesinger from Corbalas, Oregon, USA.
*23:49.560- 23:50.540* :  And my question is,
*23:50.540- 23:53.260* :  why have all the news outlets in the West
*23:53.880- 23:55.900* :  uniformly used the term hostages
*23:55.900- 24:00.300* :  to refer to those who have been captured by the Hamas
*24:00.600- 24:02.940* :  and Islamic jihad forces?
*24:03.800- 24:08.360* :  Why doesn't the BBC refer to these captured people
*24:08.360- 24:09.840* :  as prisoners of war?
*24:10.540- 24:11.700* :  Please, that one's for you.
*24:12.840- 24:14.960* :  Yes, and language is very important
*24:14.960- 24:19.020* :  but also respect for the conventions of war.
*24:19.020- 24:20.560* :  We, I think both Jeremy and I,
*24:20.980- 24:22.660* :  continue to mention in our coverage
*24:22.660- 24:25.940* :  the targeting civilians in a time of war is a war crime.
*24:25.940- 24:29.400* :  And the convention is also very clear on who are prisoners of war
*24:29.400- 24:31.080* :  and I'm gonna read from the convention
*24:31.120- 24:32.560* :  because I want this to be very clear.
*24:33.000- 24:35.100* :  It says that members of the armed forces
*24:35.100- 24:36.360* :  of a party to the conflict,
*24:36.900- 24:38.460* :  as well as members of militia
*24:38.940- 24:42.300* :  or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
*24:42.860- 24:43.420* :  In other words,
*24:43.900- 24:47.180* :  prisoners of war usually refers to those
*24:47.180- 24:50.360* :  who have taken up arms, but there is an exception
*24:50.380- 24:52.980* :  and I will read it so we're absolutely clear.
*24:52.980- 24:57.480* :  Any other non-combatants or civilians affiliated with
*24:57.960- 24:59.780* :  but not part of a belligent military
*25:00.380- 25:01.880* :  such as reporters and contractors
*25:02.680- 25:04.880* :  have the right to be treated as a prisoner of war.
*25:04.880- 25:07.540* :  So you can request if you're part of an armed force
*25:07.540- 25:10.100* :  but you're not actually fighting, you're affiliated in some way,
*25:10.460- 25:11.220* :  you could ask for that.
*25:11.260- 25:13.840* :  That obviously doesn't apply in this case.
*25:13.840- 25:15.840* :  These were innocent civilians
*25:16.460- 25:18.160* :  from 18-month old babies
*25:18.720- 25:20.560* :  to 80-year-old Holocaust survivors.
*25:21.440- 25:23.040* :  These are innocent civilians.
*25:23.400- 25:25.160* :  What about the siege warfare question?
*25:26.580- 25:27.320* :  Siege.
*25:27.500- 25:30.440* :  Well, Jerry and I both covered Syria
*25:31.100- 25:35.680* :  where a siege, laying siege to entire villages
*25:36.060- 25:37.460* :  and parts of big cities,
*25:38.080- 25:41.580* :  was one of the most powerful weapons of war
*25:41.580- 25:43.340* :  used by President Assad's forces.
*25:43.960- 25:46.280* :  Yes, it is a medieval term,
*25:46.360- 25:50.360* :  but such is the finality of war in our time,
*25:50.360- 25:53.140* :  the mercilessness of war in our time
*25:53.900- 25:57.380* :  that starving fighters into submission was used in Syria.
*25:57.920- 26:00.320* :  The siege is also being used here in Gaza.
*26:00.320- 26:04.100* :  That is the word that Israel used because they've made it clear
*26:04.100- 26:06.080* :  they're not going to turn on the water
*26:06.080- 26:07.920* :  or allow food or fuel in,
*26:08.360- 26:10.340* :  turn on the switch on the electricity
*26:11.000- 26:13.420* :  until all the hostages are returned.
*26:13.920- 26:15.080* :  This is a war crime.
*26:15.120- 26:17.640* :  It is targeting civilians in a time of war.
*26:17.640- 26:21.760* :  And yes, it is as brutal as the medieval Sieges of old.
*26:22.360- 26:25.220* :  Reporting on something like this,
*26:25.220- 26:26.660* :  on a crisis like this,
*26:27.380- 26:29.020* :  it's very difficult, isn't it,
*26:29.240- 26:30.860* :  to be accurate,
*26:30.880- 26:33.900* :  to be sure that the information that you are receiving
*26:34.520- 26:35.320* :  is true?
*26:35.860- 26:38.420* :  We've had some questions about how we verify information.
*26:39.040- 26:40.820* :  So, Jeremy, how do you do that?
*26:41.980- 26:44.660* :  Well, in terms of the numbers of people who've been killed
*26:44.660- 26:47.200* :  or wounded, I think sometimes it is an approximation
*26:47.460- 26:49.820* :  and it still is at the moment in terms of those
*26:49.820- 26:52.180* :  who were killed in that Hamas attack
*26:52.180- 26:54.680* :  because, friendly, they're still finding bodies,
*26:54.680- 26:55.880* :  they don't really know.
*26:56.400- 26:59.360* :  In terms of verifying things like those videos, you see,
*26:59.760- 27:01.100* :  I mean, one thing that's really changed
*27:01.580- 27:03.560* :  reporting since the advent of the smartphone
*27:04.280- 27:06.300* :  is the fact that so much videos are around.
*27:07.580- 27:08.780* :  So, you know, we try and prove things.
*27:08.780- 27:09.960* :  We don't just stick them out there.
*27:10.580- 27:14.220* :  And we hear a lot about just how intractable a conflict this is.
*27:14.520- 27:17.820* :  And of course, our listeners have questions about how to resolve it.
*27:18.440- 27:21.080* :  First, there was this suggestion about a short-term solution.
*27:22.020- 27:23.480* :  Hi, this is Sam Oppenheim,
*27:23.480- 27:25.080* :  a New York City public school teacher.
*27:25.420- 27:29.280* :  And my question is, would Israel consider a humanitarian corridor
*27:29.280- 27:31.060* :  and a temporary ceasefire
*27:31.540- 27:33.780* :  that could allow women and children out of Gaza,
*27:33.780- 27:36.840* :  for example, into Egypt or an army camp
*27:36.840- 27:38.360* :  or all the way to the West Bank?
*27:38.880- 27:40.500* :  I understand that the Israeli military
*27:40.500- 27:42.700* :  is looking for a military solution,
*27:42.860- 27:46.000* :  but in all the interviews that you've posted on the BBC podcast,
*27:46.000- 27:47.960* :  they claim to value civilian lives
*27:48.660- 27:50.460* :  of innocent non-Hamas actors.
*27:51.020- 27:53.100* :  So, could Israel put weight behind those statements?
*27:53.880- 27:54.280* :  Lays.
*27:55.860- 27:57.160* :  Israel is under huge pressure now.
*27:57.160- 27:59.140* :  Most of all pressure from its own people
*27:59.140- 28:02.320* :  after these atrocities committed by Hamas,
*28:02.380- 28:05.600* :  there is deep, deep anger and fear in this society
*28:05.600- 28:09.680* :  and a very strong feeling of the need to retaliate,
*28:09.680- 28:12.160* :  to use their phrase to crush Hamas.
*28:13.020- 28:14.660* :  But there is also pressure on Israel
*28:14.660- 28:16.360* :  from its closest of allies,
*28:16.360- 28:17.720* :  including the United States,
*28:18.320- 28:19.900* :  to use the phrase used by the US,
*28:20.440- 28:22.340* :  how you respond matters as well,
*28:22.340- 28:25.520* :  that there are rules even in war.
*28:25.520- 28:27.340* :  And one of the most important rules
*28:27.340- 28:30.500* :  is not targeting civilians, that is a war crime.
*28:31.160- 28:33.700* :  So Israel seems to be, I mean, listening to that,
*28:33.720- 28:35.240* :  there's also discussions with Egypt,
*28:35.760- 28:37.820* :  about trying to keep that crossing open,
*28:37.880- 28:39.660* :  but Egypt has its own concerns.
*28:39.660- 28:43.380* :  It doesn't want a huge influx of Palestinians onto its territory.
*28:44.300- 28:45.520* :  And the graph of crossing,
*28:45.520- 28:47.840* :  it can't move people quickly enough through it.
*28:48.200- 28:49.480* :  Israel does not want to be delayed.
*28:49.480- 28:52.880* :  It's not in a mood to compromise in any way.
*28:52.880- 28:54.860* :  The clock for its military operations
*28:55.320- 28:58.260* :  matters more than the clock on the time it would take
*28:58.260- 29:00.280* :  to open a humanitarian corridor.
*29:00.660- 29:03.880* :  There's not even a window, much less a corridor now.
*29:03.880- 29:05.500* :  And I think we'll see in the days to come,
*29:05.940- 29:09.680* :  how far they're willing to heed these expressions of concern,
*29:09.680- 29:11.020* :  which grow ever louder,
*29:11.600- 29:13.900* :  about the price that civilians will pay
*29:14.480- 29:16.380* :  for Israel's military operations,
*29:16.460- 29:18.540* :  which, of course, Israel has a lot of support
*29:18.540- 29:20.220* :  for that from its allies too.
*29:21.140- 29:23.660* :  And finally, the biggest question of all.
*29:24.820- 29:26.100* :  Hi, it's Alex from Colchester.
*29:26.520- 29:28.600* :  My question is, what is the solution?
*29:29.360- 29:30.660* :  What would it take from both sides
*29:30.660- 29:32.460* :  for a lasting peace to be brought about?
*29:33.560- 29:35.440* :  Which of you wants to go first? Jeremy or Lisa?
*29:36.320- 29:39.160* :  I have a question. Go ahead, Jeremy.
*29:39.720- 29:42.240* :  Once upon a time, there was something called the peace process.
*29:43.380- 29:45.780* :  Back in the 90s, it raised an awful lot of hopes.
*29:45.820- 29:48.960* :  The idea was that through negotiation,
*29:49.840- 29:53.380* :  there would be a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
*29:53.380- 29:55.980* :  Now for a number of complicated reasons,
*29:56.020- 29:59.060* :  which we don't have time to get into, that did not work.
*29:59.860- 30:01.720* :  It was in intensive care for a while.
*30:02.100- 30:04.760* :  Diplomats, particularly some very hardworking Americans,
*30:04.760- 30:09.020* :  tried to jolt it back into life, but it didn't succeed.
*30:10.080- 30:11.700* :  Perhaps it was never going to succeed.
*30:11.700- 30:14.040* :  Perhaps the differences between the two sides
*30:15.100- 30:15.860* :  were too great.
*30:15.860- 30:18.700* :  And for the last 10 years or so,
*30:18.800- 30:20.400* :  since the Americans last had a go,
*30:20.400- 30:22.060* :  trying to revive that peace process,
*30:22.460- 30:24.840* :  the conflict has effectively been left to fester.
*30:25.420- 30:27.320* :  And a feeling has grown up, particularly, I think,
*30:27.320- 30:29.580* :  among Mr. Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister,
*30:30.100- 30:30.860* :  and his allies.
*30:30.860- 30:33.120* :  And also some of his allies have brought, as well,
*30:33.840- 30:37.480* :  that it could be managed, that it was a conflict
*30:37.480- 30:39.100* :  that could be contained in Israel,
*30:39.100- 30:41.960* :  could get on with other things, like dealing with Iran,
*30:41.960- 30:45.820* :  like maybe having a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia,
*30:46.380- 30:48.140* :  and they could build a new Middle East.
*30:48.260- 30:50.240* :  But there was always this terrible problem
*30:50.760- 30:54.400* :  of the Arab Israeli, the Palestinian Israeli conflict.
*30:55.040- 30:57.520* :  And I would argue, it's really central
*30:57.840- 30:59.500* :  to the problems of the region.
*30:59.540- 31:01.980* :  And I think that that has been shown once again
*31:02.520- 31:05.200* :  by the tragic horrendous brutal events
*31:05.840- 31:08.420* :  starting with that Hamas raid.
*31:08.420- 31:12.020* :  So you could say that perhaps there was a moment
*31:12.640- 31:15.200* :  back in the 90s when they might have got close to it,
*31:15.200- 31:16.160* :  that might have had a chance,
*31:16.700- 31:17.920* :  but that moment went away.
*31:18.460- 31:21.160* :  And I thought for some time that an explosion was coming,
*31:21.160- 31:23.100* :  I didn't expect it the way it was.
*31:24.460- 31:25.960* :  The optimistic way of looking at it,
*31:25.960- 31:28.020* :  if you want to find a silver lining somewhere in the cloud,
*31:28.960- 31:31.940* :  is that perhaps this will jolt all parties,
*31:32.540- 31:33.440* :  I'm not talking about Hamas,
*31:33.440- 31:35.560* :  I'm talking about Palestinians, I'm talking about Israelis,
*31:35.980- 31:39.100* :  they're allies into doing some kind of a deal
*31:39.100- 31:43.080* :  to at least talking about doing some kind of a deal.
*31:43.080- 31:45.180* :  That's the optimistic one, the pessimistic one,
*31:45.180- 31:48.340* :  is we go even further down from here.
*31:48.860- 31:52.720* :  And ladies, the mantra was land for peace.
*31:53.040- 31:55.300* :  And for the Palestinians, the land meant returning
*31:55.300- 31:58.120* :  to the borders of the territory seized by Israel
*31:58.780- 32:02.100* :  in the 1967 war or land swaps
*32:02.100- 32:03.800* :  so that they had enough territory
*32:04.520- 32:08.160* :  to make an effective and a cohesive Palestinian state.
*32:08.660- 32:10.660* :  And when those negotiations were started,
*32:10.660- 32:13.160* :  and they were hope that they could be concluded,
*32:13.600- 32:15.800* :  there had to be a corridor which connected Gaza
*32:16.480- 32:17.660* :  with the West Bank.
*32:18.360- 32:20.260* :  So I think for the majority of Palestinians,
*32:20.260- 32:23.540* :  a Palestinian state control over their own lives
*32:24.160- 32:24.860* :  is what they want.
*32:24.880- 32:27.920* :  And I think Israelis would want to be out of Palestinian lives.
*32:28.040- 32:29.200* :  For a long time, they talked to peace,
*32:29.200- 32:30.480* :  then they talked about separation.
*32:30.620- 32:34.020* :  They don't want to be have each other to interfere
*32:34.020- 32:35.760* :  and especially not in the way they're doing now.
*32:36.360- 32:38.560* :  The big question is what does Hamas want?
*32:38.560- 32:41.180* :  Israelis get really worried and angry
*32:41.180- 32:43.720* :  that Hamas has not changed its founding charter,
*32:43.720- 32:46.480* :  which calls for the destruction of the state of Israel.
*32:47.060- 32:49.760* :  Now in recent years, they have come up with documents
*32:49.760- 32:52.540* :  which talked about their readiness to accept
*32:52.540- 32:55.520* :  that there could be a state, if principles like
*32:55.840- 32:57.520* :  the right of Palestinians to return
*32:57.520- 32:59.560* :  are respected by Israel, it's carried out
*33:00.060- 33:01.760* :  that it's possible that they could move toward
*33:01.760- 33:03.740* :  some kind of an agreement.
*33:03.820- 33:06.080* :  But I think what this current crisis tells us
*33:06.080- 33:07.340* :  is that Hamas is divided.
*33:07.780- 33:09.460* :  There are political leaders in Hamas
*33:09.460- 33:11.060* :  who didn't know about this assault,
*33:11.460- 33:13.020* :  who don't support this assault,
*33:13.020- 33:15.540* :  who we're trying to move away from the rule of the gun,
*33:15.540- 33:18.920* :  but the military wing, which seems to be the one in charge now,
*33:18.980- 33:21.720* :  the big question is what do they want?
*33:22.660- 33:24.580* :  Please, thank you, that was Lee's due set.
*33:24.620- 33:26.120* :  We've also heard from Jeremy Bowen.

*33:47.780- 33:50.260* :  and even more they care about what's happening.
*33:53.200- 33:54.760* :  And that's it from us for now,
