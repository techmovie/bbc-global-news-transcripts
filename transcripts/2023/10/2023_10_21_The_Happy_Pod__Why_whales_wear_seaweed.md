*01:17.440- 01:20.720* :  Oh boy, how you powerless me, Mickey Mouse. Hey, Pluto!
*01:21.240- 01:25.260* :  This is Andrew Peach in London. This is Danielle in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania,
*01:25.260- 01:30.740* :  and you're listening to the happy part. Hello, I'm Carolyn Acosta and I'm in Bogota, Colombia,
*01:30.740- 01:36.460* :  and you're listening to the happy part. This is Andy Hyde from Durango, Colorado, and you're listening
*01:36.460- 01:46.140* :  to the happy part. On the way, a new way of persuading children to try on glasses in Pennsylvania.
*01:46.800- 01:50.960* :  By the time they come to see me, they've been to the eye doctor and maybe had drops in their
*01:50.960- 01:55.360* :  eyes and all sorts of intrusive things, and so I hear I come at them trying to put something
*01:55.360- 02:00.280* :  on their face and they're like, no, get away. In Kenya, innovation to offset climate change.
*02:00.720- 02:05.860* :  We are slowly learning how to deal with the droughts. I can only hope that the younger generation
*02:05.860- 02:12.000* :  pick up our ideas. A hike through Sequoia National Park in California that could have broken a record.
*02:12.600- 02:16.240* :  Everyone that saw us on the hike was definitely intrigued where we had giant mallets sticking
*02:16.240- 02:22.980* :  out of our packs. And Nora, who's done a PhD in kangaroos. Oh, I just love how social they are
*02:22.980- 02:26.700* :  and they're very cute, which doesn't hurt as well. All on the way in the happy part.
*02:32.760- 02:37.920* :  And we're going big to start our happy animal news with whales in Australia. Researchers there
*02:37.920- 02:43.020* :  have found that these marine mammals enjoy nothing more than swirling around in algae and seaweed.
*02:43.020- 02:49.120* :  Some even enjoy wearing it on their heads, like a hat. It's called kelping as Jacob Evans found
*02:49.120- 02:54.040* :  out from the man behind the study. My opinion is that we should all be act like whales.
*02:54.260- 03:00.140* :  That's Dr Olaf Minerca. He's been studying whales for the best part of 15 years, and now he's
*03:00.140- 03:06.440* :  trying to figure out what they do to relax. We have looked into why whales might interact with
*03:06.860- 03:12.940* :  seaweed and do this kelping. And it was very interesting to see that the animals seem to be doing
*03:12.940- 03:19.460* :  this in different populations in the northern end in the southern hemisphere. And the whale is
*03:19.460- 03:26.220* :  basically actively seeking out that seaweed or the kelp and then placing it at different body
*03:26.220- 03:32.480* :  parts. And it can be an interaction that lasts for 30 minutes or even longer. And there's one spot
*03:32.480- 03:37.920* :  in particular that the whale's fancy. So we have got evidence of at least three or well four
*03:37.920- 03:43.860* :  different species. And it seems all have a preference to place it on their head.
*03:45.760- 03:51.340* :  There could be a simple explanation for that is because all of these baling whales also have a
*03:51.340- 03:58.240* :  sensory system that is made out of fine hairs on their head and maybe by touching that seaweed
*03:58.240- 04:04.040* :  it does give a nice sensation. And what we found in particular for humpback whales is that
*04:04.820- 04:10.860* :  they're sometimes also throw it into the air, but a lot of times they're are rolling and trying
*04:10.860- 04:16.060* :  to, you know, use the hat to swim through it. But they're not just putting the kelp on their heads.
*04:16.380- 04:23.460* :  The whales were actually taking the seaweed into their mouths and swimming down into the water column
*04:23.460- 04:29.480* :  is it and then releasing it again. And for me, that is a very interesting behavior for a baling
*04:29.480- 04:35.220* :  whale. They don't have teeth. You don't bite you filter. And so taking it into the mouths,
*04:35.700- 04:42.440* :  one good reason for that could be, it actually is a bit like a toothbrush because that part,
*04:42.440- 04:47.860* :  those lips and that part of of their mouths would be extremely difficult to clean. And there
*04:47.860- 04:53.380* :  is certainly organisms that like to settle there. Maybe it's just a play, but could also be quite
*04:53.380- 04:58.400* :  meaningful. Whales are very intelligent, very sentient creatures, and they can also be rather
*04:58.400- 05:05.060* :  friendly. Kelping can actually happen as a social activity. And that is something that fascinated me
*05:05.060- 05:12.220* :  to see three individuals sharing kelp with each other. And it was all of them rolling through
*05:12.220- 05:17.960* :  this kelp and then one piece went over to the other individual and another piece to the next
*05:17.960- 05:25.140* :  individual. And then another two whales actually came by and checked out the scenery. And it was just
*05:25.140- 05:32.020* :  clear that this kind of interaction with the seaweed was a positive one that was happily shared
*05:32.020- 05:37.100* :  with other individuals. Dr. Minerka's team at Griffith University in Queensland have called the
*05:37.100- 05:41.880* :  discovery a global phenomenon and have been inundated with messages from people across the
*05:41.880- 05:47.520* :  world who say they've seen this exact same behavior. I had some fantastic responses. And of course,
*05:48.300- 05:55.240* :  in particular, in times of a lot of set news, people are really happy to learn about whales playing
*05:55.240- 06:00.940* :  with kelp. So next time you scratch your head or clean your teeth, just remember, a whale may be
*06:00.940- 06:06.960* :  trying to do the same. From whales to cats and a 14 year old feline has broken the Guinness world
*06:06.960- 06:12.840* :  record for the loudest per from the comfort of her favorite cushion. Beller from Cambridgeer
*06:12.840- 06:19.780* :  in the UK achieved a per measuring 54.6 decibels. That's the equivalent of the volume of a boiling kettle.
*06:28.580- 06:32.700* :  Wow, that is quite a per, isn't it? In the United States, here's another cat making an impact
*06:32.700- 06:38.540* :  at an lake clinic in the US. They found a new way to get children to try on glasses. And that
*06:38.540- 06:43.480* :  way is truffles, I spoke to her owner, Daniel Crull, in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.
*06:44.060- 06:52.340* :  Truffles is a extremely fluffy black and white texito cat. She was a stray. Her mom was a stray cat
*06:52.340- 06:58.600* :  with just really short, torty color hair, but she turned out with this big fluffy black and white
*06:58.600- 07:03.120* :  texito. She's super cute. Now, tell me how you first discover that truffles
*07:03.660- 07:08.140* :  doesn't mind wearing glasses. How did she ever come to put a pair of glasses on in the first place?
*07:08.920- 07:14.580* :  When I got trouble, she was about 12 weeks old and she was super smart. And I just kind of
*07:14.580- 07:20.780* :  had this crazy idea. I wondered if she would put glasses on for me. I have a children's optical shop
*07:20.840- 07:25.920* :  and we fit kids with glasses of all ages starting from infants on up. And probably the most
*07:25.920- 07:31.100* :  difficult age is like that two to four where they're really unsure about what's happening. And I
*07:31.100- 07:34.800* :  thought, well, I wonder if truffles would put glasses on and I could show them that it's okay.
*07:35.700- 07:40.340* :  And so I made a pair of glasses, similarly, that I would make for an infant as she was right
*07:40.340- 07:45.600* :  in that size. And then I just taught her how to take them off. And it just seemed she really
*07:45.600- 07:50.760* :  took to it very quickly. And she really does love wearing them. And like I said, she can take
*07:50.760- 07:55.800* :  them off. But often, I'll put them on for demonstration. And then I'll be like, oh, you could take
*07:55.800- 07:58.620* :  them off and she walks away and it's like, no, I want to keep them on.
*08:00.040- 08:04.580* :  And I can imagine for the children of the age you're talking about, young children who need glasses.
*08:04.580- 08:08.440* :  Actually, I needy glasses. I've all them since the age of four every day of my life. I feel really
*08:08.440- 08:14.100* :  weird without them. But it's a bit of a sort of strange idea for a young child to have to put
*08:14.100- 08:18.540* :  glasses on for the first time, especially when they see that other children of their age don't tend
*08:18.540- 08:22.940* :  to be wearing them. Absolutely. And I think, you know, by the time they come to see me, they've been
*08:22.940- 08:27.740* :  to the eye doctor and maybe you've had drops in their eyes and all sorts of intrusive things. And
*08:27.740- 08:31.700* :  so I hear I come at them trying to put something on their face and they're like, no, get away.
*08:32.320- 08:36.880* :  And now truffles is, she's like a charm. She'll put the glasses on and the little kiddo's like,
*08:36.900- 08:40.440* :  oh, okay. And then we're like, now it's your turn. And then they put them right on. And they
*08:40.440- 08:44.540* :  just relate to her so quickly. I was really surprised by that. And very pleased, of course.
*08:45.240- 08:51.440* :  Tell me about color blindness because you've got some special glasses for truffles that mean that
*08:51.440- 08:55.960* :  she can distinguish colors better and she likes those even more. I wanted to bring some awareness
*08:55.960- 09:01.780* :  to color blindness and kids about one in 12 boys or color blind, about one in 300 girls or color
*09:01.780- 09:06.000* :  blind. And I wanted to bring some awareness. And I just thought, well, you know what, I'm going
*09:06.000- 09:10.940* :  to make truffles color blindness glasses and just see what happens with her. I know cats do have
*09:10.940- 09:16.900* :  color deficiency. So I made the glasses. And when I filmed it, it was just like, I have no idea
*09:16.900- 09:22.800* :  how her reaction is going to be. But when I put them on her, she just sat up so quickly and she looked
*09:22.800- 09:30.020* :  around and I'm not sure there's no way for me to say 100% that she sees color out of them. But
*09:30.020- 09:36.020* :  she really does love how she sees out of them. She definitely sees differently. They quickly
*09:36.020- 09:41.160* :  became her favorite pair of glasses. And to the point of, you know, when I try to take them off,
*09:41.200- 09:45.120* :  she definitely does not want me to take them off. She like pushes my hand away. And it's like, no,
*09:45.120- 09:51.800* :  no, no. So truffles has a job as an optometrist. And she's also now a social media star. What next
*09:51.800- 09:57.080* :  for her? She also has a nonprofit organization called the truffles the kitty organization. And
*09:57.080- 10:02.180* :  that allows her to help kids and encourage kids to wear glasses or eye patches or kids that are
*10:02.180- 10:07.740* :  going through surgeries. And so she's very busy being the chairperson of her organization.
*10:08.960- 10:12.700* :  Thanks to Danielle. And to truffles, you sat and watched that whole conversation on Zoom.
*10:13.220- 10:16.900* :  Kangaroos next, add a new theory about how they get on with each other.
*10:17.320- 10:22.880* :  PhD student Nora Campbell has identified new patterns of behavior that have never been seen before.
*10:22.880- 10:29.120* :  She's been talking to Jackie. Well, we had a long data set six years. And so with all of that
*10:29.120- 10:32.580* :  information, we really could have looked for anything. But because we were able to identify
*10:32.580- 10:36.720* :  them individually, we thought it might be really interesting to look at how each individual
*10:36.720- 10:40.740* :  guru is behaving and how their social networks were changing throughout the years.
*10:41.140- 10:46.120* :  We found two really big things. The first was that females with young actually had a much
*10:46.120- 10:51.500* :  higher sociality than females without young, which was quite different to previous studies,
*10:51.540- 10:55.800* :  which have shown that females tend to isolate themselves when they have joys. And the second
*10:55.800- 11:00.700* :  really interesting thing we found was potential evidence for long-term relationships in kangaroos,
*11:00.760- 11:03.660* :  which is the first we've ever seen in macapods, which is really exciting.
*11:04.680- 11:07.140* :  So what you're saying is that the mums have mates.
*11:08.060- 11:11.080* :  Yeah, suppose so. It certainly seems that way.
*11:11.560- 11:17.680* :  You are still finding things that surprise you. We are still finding things to surprise us about
*11:17.680- 11:24.500* :  kangaroos. Oh, absolutely. I mean, kangaroos have been studied for centuries by Indigenous
*11:24.500- 11:30.440* :  Australians and then for a much smaller amount of time by European Australians. But as technology
*11:30.440- 11:35.080* :  advances, and as we sort of learn to look at things closer, we're always able to see a little bit
*11:35.080- 11:38.220* :  more, which is one of my favourite things about science. There's always more to discover.
*11:39.060- 11:45.460* :  If you have an animal story, other listeners need to hear global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*11:46.160- 11:51.020* :  Now to Kenya, where mass eye leaders are experimenting with new ways of tackling climate change.
*11:51.460- 11:55.320* :  For the last two and a half years, a severe drought has gripped the horn of Africa, causing
*11:55.320- 12:00.740* :  starvation among families who rely on livestock. One community is using a simple solution to
*12:00.740- 12:07.720* :  re-green their land, so for Eastore reports. Our land is so hot. It's practically ashes.
*12:08.680- 12:15.180* :  In this dusty and dry corner of southern Kenya, people are experiencing the worst drought in 40
*12:15.180- 12:21.400* :  years. The land close to the border with Tanzania is brown, brittle and baked.
*12:25.740- 12:27.420* :  The livestock are dead because of the drought.
*12:28.060- 12:35.080* :  Olesonco is a mass eye cattle herder. He's one of 23 million people facing starvation across
*12:35.080- 12:46.380* :  Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya. I had 400 livestock and 300 are dead. Only God can help me recover from
*12:46.380- 12:51.280* :  such a big loss. This was the only source of livelihood for my family.
*12:54.820- 13:01.240* :  But there is hope. As you look across the landscape, in some fields, you notice something strange.
*13:02.860- 13:11.020* :  Little half circles or half moons of green. Like icebergs in an ocean, they are splashes of color
*13:11.020- 13:16.460* :  in a brown sea. These are our solution. Half moons,
*13:17.300- 13:23.600* :  Lonoi Mitekenei is a young mass eye leader, but she's also a conservationist. They are
*13:23.600- 13:31.200* :  designed as small dams with a depth of half a meter each that captures rainwater, which seeps into
*13:31.200- 13:40.940* :  the soil. Once the half moons are receded with native grass species, vast amount of
*13:40.940- 13:47.980* :  land starts to green. Her tribe have been working with an NGO called Just Digit since 2016.
*13:48.820- 13:55.060* :  Since then, they've restored 3,000 hectares of land that's 6,000 football pitches.
*13:56.040- 13:57.940* :  Lonoia is a digging supervisor.
*14:00.140- 14:06.100* :  The first time we started, people didn't believe like they would be grass, but as we have progressed
*14:06.100- 14:11.160* :  over time, the community has really seen that this is something that is working.
*14:12.260- 14:17.400* :  Now these half moons have proven to work, it's hoped that the next generation will continue
*14:17.400- 14:21.200* :  to find innovative ways to deal with the impact of climate change.
*14:22.720- 14:25.440* :  We are slowly learning how to deal with the droughts.
*14:27.340- 14:30.900* :  I can only hope that the younger generation picked up our igannis.
*14:32.740- 14:36.840* :  They can see that these half moons are a simple solution to save our land.
*14:40.680- 14:44.620* :  And you can hear more stories like that on the climate question, which is available wherever you
*14:44.620- 14:45.840* :  get your BBC podcasts.
*14:50.800- 14:55.300* :  Start calling the happy part 100 years of Disney with Paula, the Disney historian.
*14:55.520- 15:03.160* :  He felt that if he put the best efforts into making it the best possible thing it could be,
*15:03.260- 15:08.080* :  to take it to the next level, that it would appeal to people.
*15:08.440- 15:14.100* :  And of all the things to do at the top of a mountain in California, what made Andy think of playing croquet?

*16:18.200- 16:20.020* :  We're here in my B-Lab.
*16:20.180- 16:21.940* :  In front of a box of bees.
*16:22.100- 16:23.940* :  A real bad side effect at all.

*16:45.820- 16:48.000* :  and then you started doing the happy pods,
*16:48.500- 16:49.980* :  which are really a great relief.
*16:50.460- 16:53.240* :  And you had requested like people sending happy things,
*16:53.560- 16:56.320* :  and we've been especially happy this year,
*16:56.320- 17:00.520* :  because we've been able to form our orchestra,
*17:00.580- 17:02.820* :  which we've been dreaming of for a long time.
*17:14.760- 17:19.060* :  And I thought, oh no, that is something that really does make me smile,
*17:19.560- 17:22.500* :  and you had requested something that made you smile in the morning,
*17:22.500- 17:23.080* :  and I thought,
*17:23.440- 17:26.520* :  this makes me smile, and I'm sure it'll make other people smile too.
*17:27.220- 17:28.280* :  We love happy stories,
*17:28.280- 17:33.100* :  and this is part of an organisation that you run in Bogota.
*17:33.400- 17:36.860* :  Tell me a bit about that. What does the organisation do for young people there?
*17:37.620- 17:39.600* :  Well, it started 21 years ago.
*17:40.260- 17:46.540* :  Initially, it was something that we started to help internally displaced refugees
*17:46.540- 17:49.980* :  from conflict zones around the country.
*17:50.780- 17:55.700* :  And there are big settlements of these internally displaced people in Bogota.
*17:56.680- 17:59.420* :  Do we think there must be something that we can do to help?
*17:59.880- 18:03.340* :  And the community said that they needed a place
*18:03.340- 18:07.760* :  where they could leave their children safely whilst they went to work.
*18:08.100- 18:10.140* :  And it's interesting that you've developed it beyond
*18:11.260- 18:13.720* :  providing what you might call quite basic things
*18:13.720- 18:18.200* :  for these young people displaced by the civil war,
*18:18.740- 18:22.400* :  into cultural things, things that are enriching the music,
*18:22.400- 18:24.360* :  the arts, theatre, all those kind of things.
*18:24.360- 18:27.380* :  And of course, young people need as well for a joyous life.
*18:28.240- 18:30.780* :  That became sort of like a gradual thing.
*18:31.460- 18:34.540* :  We began to do like, okay, so they need help with their homework.
*18:34.700- 18:37.960* :  And okay, but after they do their homework, what else?
*18:38.380- 18:41.400* :  Do you remember someone suggesting the orchestra for the first time?
*18:42.260- 18:45.320* :  There was a school in Bogota that helps us.
*18:45.700- 18:48.320* :  They have their own fabulous orchestra and they were competing.
*18:48.340- 18:52.900* :  And I remember saying, oh, gosh, I would love that.
*18:53.340- 18:57.280* :  And the headmaster of the school said, okay, well, let's see what we can do.
*18:57.840- 19:00.940* :  And he helped me get some teachers.
*19:01.640- 19:05.260* :  And yeah, and then eventually he formed it this year.
*19:05.260- 19:08.060* :  But gradually, you know, people donating their instruments.
*19:08.860- 19:11.660* :  It's fabulous. They learn discipline.
*19:11.660- 19:15.240* :  And well, they say it's terribly good for maths.
*19:15.240- 19:18.560* :  So I'm waiting to see the results of that.
*19:19.060- 19:20.300* :  But yes, it's teamwork.
*19:21.220- 19:22.880* :  It's also self-expression.
*19:23.780- 19:27.120* :  So being able to take the instruments home and practicing
*19:27.640- 19:31.400* :  and even performing, you know, as a group with their classmates,
*19:31.400- 19:33.900* :  that was just very good for them.
*19:51.660- 19:53.540* :  Great to hear the children of Bogota.
*19:54.220- 19:57.620* :  As long ago as the 14th century, people in northern France,
*19:57.620- 20:01.440* :  were using themselves by using mallets to knock ball through hoops,
*20:01.780- 20:02.860* :  made of willow branches.
*20:03.520- 20:06.280* :  Although it was in Ireland, where croquet became really popular,
*20:06.280- 20:10.260* :  it's usually played on grass rather than at the top of a mountain.
*20:10.700- 20:12.500* :  But my next guest had other ideas.
*20:12.880- 20:14.980* :  Andy and his friends were on a week-long hike
*20:14.980- 20:18.060* :  through California's beautiful Sequoia National Park,
*20:18.060- 20:20.260* :  finishing at the summit of Mount Whitney,
*20:20.260- 20:23.420* :  the highest peak in the United States outside Alaska.
*20:24.060- 20:26.680* :  And once they got to 14 and a half thousand feet,
*20:27.280- 20:28.360* :  they played croquet.
*20:28.700- 20:30.540* :  But how they set a new world record.
*20:31.120- 20:34.000* :  So when we're backpacking, everybody carries their own mallet.
*20:34.000- 20:35.060* :  They carry their own ball.
*20:35.640- 20:38.240* :  And we backpacked this trip for seven days.
*20:38.640- 20:41.880* :  So everyone that saw us on the hike was definitely intrigued
*20:41.880- 20:44.080* :  where we had giant mallets sticking out of our packs.
*20:44.400- 20:45.440* :  But the hike was quite lovely.
*20:45.440- 20:48.640* :  We started on the west side in Sequoia National Park,
*20:48.680- 20:51.400* :  and then we headed east across this year a mountain range.
*20:51.980- 20:53.780* :  And the last day we ended on Mount Whitney.
*20:54.260- 20:56.920* :  The night before we slept at 13,500 feet
*20:56.920- 20:59.100* :  so that we could summit during the sunrise,
*20:59.940- 21:00.700* :  which was beautiful.
*21:00.700- 21:03.160* :  But it was probably 20 degrees when we got to the top.
*21:03.160- 21:05.060* :  And we really wanted to play croquet up there,
*21:05.540- 21:07.280* :  which was a challenge to say the least.
*21:07.720- 21:11.460* :  So at what point in the expedition it's someone say,
*21:11.860- 21:14.240* :  why don't we play croquet at the top of the mountain?
*21:16.800- 21:20.060* :  I think my friend Ryan had it in his mind the entire time
*21:20.060- 21:22.600* :  that we had to because we were bringing the croquet with us
*21:23.100- 21:26.060* :  and why not play at the highest elevation we've all ever been to.
*21:26.340- 21:28.420* :  So we figured we'd at least attempt it.
*21:28.720- 21:30.880* :  Is there a flat enough surface, suppose they must be?
*21:31.820- 21:34.980* :  As you can imagine, there isn't a good croquet surface up there.
*21:35.280- 21:37.760* :  The top is somewhat flat and undulating,
*21:37.760- 21:38.760* :  but it's all rock.
*21:38.800- 21:40.720* :  There's no soft ground or anything.
*21:40.720- 21:44.060* :  So we're just wedging wickets between rocks
*21:44.060- 21:46.000* :  and just trying to make a course work.
*21:46.240- 21:48.720* :  But prefer to play with softer ground, for sure.
*21:48.940- 21:51.560* :  But perfect for Instagram, YouTube,
*21:51.800- 21:53.900* :  and as it turns out, a world record.
*21:54.940- 21:55.900* :  Yes, hopefully.
*21:55.900- 21:58.660* :  We still need to submit with the Guinness book,
*21:59.300- 22:00.580* :  but I believe that it is a record.
*22:02.060- 22:04.440* :  I haven't been able to find anything in regard
*22:04.440- 22:07.180* :  to the highest elevation croquet match previous to this.
*22:07.880- 22:10.180* :  So there's a chance that someone out in the Himalayas
*22:10.180- 22:12.340* :  or something has outperformed us.
*22:12.340- 22:15.100* :  But to my knowledge, that has not occurred.
*22:15.360- 22:17.680* :  And the concern is that we won't meet the criteria
*22:17.680- 22:19.780* :  because we didn't film the whole event.
*22:19.780- 22:21.340* :  We only filmed part of the event.
*22:21.340- 22:24.080* :  So I'm not sure how strict they actually are.
*22:24.180- 22:27.500* :  I think in my experience, we've talked a lot about world records
*22:27.500- 22:28.280* :  on the happy pod.
*22:28.580- 22:29.700* :  They are quite strict.
*22:29.780- 22:31.580* :  I'm getting worried now that maybe it'll be
*22:31.580- 22:33.200* :  a sort of unofficial achievement,
*22:33.200- 22:34.460* :  but not one that they recognize.
*22:34.460- 22:35.100* :  I hope not.
*22:36.200- 22:36.820* :  Well, that's okay.
*22:37.100- 22:39.420* :  It was an achievement for us,
*22:39.680- 22:42.740* :  regardless of whether or not it's in the record book officially.
*22:42.960- 22:43.780* :  You can always go again.
*22:44.580- 22:44.920* :  We could.
*22:45.060- 22:46.420* :  I would love to do that hike again,
*22:46.420- 22:49.920* :  but man, it would be a challenge.
*22:50.980- 22:54.500* :  Now, a hundred years ago, Walt Disney created the Walt Disney Company
*22:54.500- 22:57.660* :  and his famous film studio went on to create universes
*22:57.660- 23:00.820* :  that marked the charred hunts of millions around the world.
*23:01.320- 23:02.960* :  Creating characters like Mickey Mouse,
*23:03.260- 23:04.280* :  Cinderella and Elsa,
*23:04.720- 23:07.820* :  his films were pioneering an animation as well as sound.
*23:08.320- 23:11.860* :  Paula Sigmund Lowry is the curator of the Disney 100 exhibition,
*23:11.940- 23:14.540* :  which is touring the world for the next five years.
*23:15.580- 23:17.760* :  It was actually very exciting because, of course,
*23:17.760- 23:20.260* :  I grew up as did many Americans
*23:20.260- 23:23.100* :  watching Walt Disney on television.
*23:23.180- 23:27.040* :  I would go to Disneyland with my family once a year
*23:27.220- 23:30.820* :  and the excitement about going to that park
*23:30.960- 23:31.620* :  was so great.
*23:31.620- 23:33.640* :  You could barely sleep the night before.
*23:34.360- 23:35.980* :  So I grew up with Disney.
*23:35.980- 23:37.680* :  I grew up with the Mickey Mouse Club
*23:37.720- 23:42.380* :  and the films and the characters brought a great deal of joy
*23:42.800- 23:43.480* :  into my life.
*23:43.720- 23:46.640* :  And I actually trained to be a children's library
*23:46.640- 23:48.160* :  and to be a storyteller,
*23:48.620- 23:51.440* :  to engage children's imaginations
*23:51.440- 23:55.480* :  in and learning from books and stories.
*23:56.240- 23:59.380* :  And just as I was graduating from library school,
*23:59.380- 24:00.920* :  the Walt Disney Company
*24:01.520- 24:06.660* :  had founded its archives five years earlier in 1970.
*24:06.660- 24:10.160* :  And I got a call from the dean of the library school saying,
*24:10.720- 24:13.000* :  they're looking for someone who knows how to do research.
*24:13.080- 24:16.060* :  And I know you have an interest in Disney.
*24:16.700- 24:18.200* :  I think this might be a good fit.
*24:18.300- 24:20.420* :  If we're trying to nail down what's so special,
*24:20.420- 24:22.840* :  I mean, certainly technically innovative as I was saying,
*24:22.840- 24:25.120* :  but also it always seems to me that everything
*24:25.120- 24:28.440* :  that the Disney company does is of such high quality
*24:28.440- 24:30.620* :  that can make it expensive for people to access.
*24:30.840- 24:33.480* :  But the characters, the storytelling,
*24:33.480- 24:37.180* :  the sound, the production values are always so high.
*24:38.220- 24:40.600* :  Well, that was Walt Disney's determination
*24:40.620- 24:43.400* :  to provide the highest quality to elevate
*24:44.060- 24:45.660* :  the art of what he was doing.
*24:46.280- 24:51.300* :  And he felt that if he put the best efforts
*24:51.300- 24:54.480* :  into making it the best possible thing it could be,
*24:54.480- 24:56.780* :  to take it to the next level,
*24:57.340- 24:59.440* :  that it would appeal to people.
*24:59.660- 25:02.340* :  And eventually the money would come back to him.
*25:03.080- 25:04.680* :  And from Paula, the Disney historian,
*25:04.680- 25:06.500* :  to someone else with a unique job,
*25:06.960- 25:09.020* :  Brett Eyewenner's from Pasadena, California,
*25:09.460- 25:11.580* :  Brett is the voice of Mickey Mouse.
*25:12.040- 25:13.420* :  He spoke to Iona Hampson.
*25:13.740- 25:16.280* :  I was simply a Disney fan who was fascinated by Walt Disney
*25:16.280- 25:18.140* :  and his story, and I loved Mickey Mouse.
*25:18.440- 25:20.780* :  As such, I kind of listened to Disney records
*25:20.940- 25:24.020* :  and Disney soundtracks a lot when I was drawing the characters.
*25:24.600- 25:26.600* :  And I would start talking like Mickey Mouse, just for fun.
*25:26.900- 25:27.780* :  You know, oh boy!
*25:28.220- 25:30.380* :  A few friends started recognizing that it sounded
*25:30.840- 25:32.200* :  kind of similar to Mickey Mouse,
*25:32.220- 25:33.740* :  and so they encouraged me to keep doing it.
*25:34.140- 25:35.580* :  And then eventually I just did it for a good laugh,
*25:35.760- 25:37.440* :  you know, give everyone a chuckle once in a while.
*25:37.900- 25:39.460* :  Well, a friend of mine from college actually
*25:39.460- 25:41.340* :  ended up at Pixar Animation Studios.
*25:41.820- 25:43.260* :  And she received an internal email
*25:43.260- 25:44.200* :  that was being circulated,
*25:44.200- 25:45.560* :  outlining an audition process.
*25:45.920- 25:48.040* :  They were looking for an understudy for the voice of Mickey
*25:48.160- 25:49.480* :  at the time it was Wayne Allwine.
*25:49.480- 25:50.780* :  He had done it for 32 years.
*25:51.320- 25:52.120* :  And so she sent it on to me,
*25:52.120- 25:53.260* :  she said, you have to do this.
*25:53.800- 25:55.820* :  And I thought, well, I've never been a voice actor.
*25:55.820- 25:58.580* :  I never planned on being an actor in any capacity,
*25:59.080- 26:00.180* :  but I love Mickey so much.
*26:00.180- 26:03.080* :  And this would be an amazing job and honor to have.
*26:03.460- 26:05.240* :  So I threw it out to the universe,
*26:05.300- 26:06.320* :  and I took a stab,
*26:06.380- 26:08.520* :  sending my audition, and the rest is kind of history.
*26:08.740- 26:10.660* :  And when it comes to being the official voice,
*26:10.660- 26:11.540* :  what does that mean?
*26:11.740- 26:14.180* :  Well, Disney has prided themselves for so long
*26:14.180- 26:16.580* :  in consistency of character, especially,
*26:16.580- 26:17.620* :  if you're at Disneyland,
*26:17.940- 26:19.560* :  or if you're watching Mickey on TV,
*26:19.560- 26:22.220* :  you hear Mickey the way you'd remember him to sound.
*26:22.500- 26:23.940* :  I've worked on things from theme parks
*26:24.380- 26:27.860* :  to video games, toys, radio projects,
*26:28.500- 26:31.100* :  albums, TV shows, obviously.
*26:31.520- 26:32.180* :  Things I've forgotten.
*26:32.420- 26:34.540* :  Interactive, the list goes on and on and on.
*26:34.740- 26:36.380* :  But every job is so exciting,
*26:36.440- 26:40.080* :  and every job requires a little different Mickey hat as it were.
*26:40.400- 26:42.140* :  But yeah, it just, it means it's, you know,
*26:42.320- 26:43.680* :  being the official voice in Mickey Mouse means
*26:43.680- 26:44.560* :  that there's a lot of work,
*26:44.900- 26:45.920* :  because Mickey works a lot.
*26:46.800- 26:47.740* :  At the beginning of the day,
*26:47.740- 26:49.500* :  when you have a cup of coffee or something like that,
*26:49.540- 26:50.920* :  how do you start and go, okay,
*26:50.920- 26:53.340* :  let's warm up and let's get ready to be Mickey.
*26:53.540- 26:54.540* :  Yeah, that's a great question.
*26:54.540- 26:55.700* :  It's probably something different.
*26:55.700- 26:57.520* :  Well, in the morning, I'll start with a simple,
*26:57.840- 26:58.340* :  ah!
*26:59.280- 27:00.740* :  And then I know that if I can do that scale,
*27:00.740- 27:02.040* :  I know I can do it, and then I'll start with a,
*27:02.240- 27:04.460* :  oh boy, how do you polish me, Mickey Mouse?
*27:04.960- 27:06.300* :  If I can do that, then I'm usually good.
*27:06.560- 27:07.540* :  And occasionally I'll yell up Pluto,
*27:07.840- 27:10.240* :  hey, Pluto, that's amazing.
*27:10.380- 27:13.900* :  Is there anything that you're aware of in terms of like the interaction

*27:17.520- 27:20.040* :  I tend to think that Mickey's loved Worldwide,
*27:20.040- 27:21.740* :  and I think that is his power.
*27:21.960- 27:23.100* :  You know, I've been saying a lot lately

*27:40.960- 27:44.500* :  And you know, it just, I've had a very narrow,
*27:44.500- 27:46.280* :  minded viewpoint being over in the States,
*27:46.280- 27:49.300* :  and only seeing Mickey on our TV shows and our theme parks.
*27:49.340- 27:52.660* :  So to go, even just a short hop across the bottom to France,
*27:53.040- 27:54.880* :  and see how loved and adorable he is there,
*27:54.880- 27:57.160* :  just kind of open my eyes to Mickey's universal,
*27:57.160- 28:00.160* :  in a way, his goodness, his likeability, his kindness.
*28:00.740- 28:02.960* :  It's just, it kind of transcends all cultures,
*28:02.960- 28:04.000* :  and I think that's his power.
