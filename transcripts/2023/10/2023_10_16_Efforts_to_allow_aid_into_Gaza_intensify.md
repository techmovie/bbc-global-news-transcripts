*01:08.320- 01:12.980* :  I'm Garas Barlow and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the 16th of October.
*01:13.200- 01:14.560* :  These are our main stories.
*01:15.200- 01:19.480* :  Amid a severe shortage of supplies in Gaza, the UN humanitarian affairs chief
*01:19.940- 01:23.780* :  is heading to the Middle East to try and broker an agreement to allow aid in.
*01:24.460- 01:27.160* :  Meanwhile, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken,
*01:27.560- 01:31.380* :  has returned to Israel for more talks after visiting six Arab capitals.
*01:32.160- 01:36.260* :  And the Israeli military is evacuating dozens of villages near the Lebanese border
*01:36.740- 01:39.740* :  because of the threat of rocket fire from the Hezbollah militant group.
*01:40.000- 01:42.360* :  We'll bring you all the latest from across the region.
*01:45.220- 01:50.200* :  Also in this podcast, Russia has agreed to return for Ukraine in children to their families
*01:50.740- 01:52.460* :  as part of a deal, broken by Qatar.
*01:52.840- 01:57.440* :  And it was painted by both sides as a vote about which direction Poland takes
*01:57.500- 02:02.120* :  and the opposition are talking about this being the vote for change.
*02:02.120- 02:07.660* :  It's Poland about to take a new political course with big implications for the EU and Ukraine.
*02:11.460- 02:16.580* :  We start the podcast in the Gaza Strip and even before the conflict in Gaza erupted just
*02:16.580- 02:22.280* :  over a week ago, the population of almost two and a half million people was largely reliant on aid.
*02:22.880- 02:26.580* :  Days of fighting and an Israeli imposed siege has made living conditions
*02:26.580- 02:29.020* :  dire for those trapped in the Gaza Strip.
*02:29.580- 02:34.420* :  Today, efforts to get food, water, fuel and medicine into Gaza have all intensified.
*02:34.980- 02:37.860* :  As we record this podcast, we've just heard from the White House
*02:38.200- 02:41.740* :  that the US is hopeful that the wrath of crossing between Gaza and Egypt
*02:42.160- 02:44.320* :  will open for a few hours later today.
*02:44.320- 02:46.860* :  To what extent though, is currently unclear.
*02:47.440- 02:52.700* :  UN and US officials are both hoping to broker a deal to allow some aid in and some people.
*02:53.800- 02:57.820* :  Just north of the crossing is the southern Gaza City of Khan Unis, which is normally
*02:57.820- 03:03.300* :  home to 400,000 people. Its population has more than doubled in recent days as people
*03:03.300- 03:08.320* :  flee bombing further north. Living conditions there are described as now almost impossible.
*03:09.100- 03:12.280* :  We've been hearing from the UN humanitarian affairs chief Maiden Griffiths
*03:12.560- 03:14.160* :  about the situation in Gaza.
*03:14.700- 03:19.560* :  As I understand it, about a million people from the north of Gaza have moved south.
*03:20.560- 03:26.060* :  In response to the Israeli directive or request or suggestion that they should move
*03:26.660- 03:30.920* :  out of harm's way. Of course, they are all over the south trying to find
*03:30.920- 03:34.120* :  place of safety, which is very difficult. That's number one.
*03:34.180- 03:39.360* :  Number two, there has been no movement and this is crucial and I want to make it
*03:39.980- 03:43.780* :  upfront and early on the release of those hostages.
*03:44.560- 03:49.440* :  The taking of those hostages was an egregious, illegal, unacceptable, immoral act.
*03:49.940- 03:56.200* :  They must be released. Imagine children as hostages playing that role. They have to be released
*03:57.320- 04:03.140* :  immediately. Number three, we are in deep in negotiations. Have been for days
*04:04.000- 04:08.480* :  helped a great deal by the way by Secretary Blinken and his constant efforts
*04:09.560- 04:16.440* :  to arrange with the help of the Egyptians and the Israelis to get the first emergency aid into
*04:17.160- 04:23.100* :  Gaza from Raffa to help those million and others who are situated in the south.
*04:24.020- 04:29.760* :  There is an international humanitarian law requirement, as you know, that for people to move
*04:29.760- 04:38.280* :  out of harm's way in a war is one thing. But to do it in a way that they have access to places
*04:38.280- 04:44.680* :  of safety that they themselves can choose to humanity and aid that will allow them to move safely
*04:45.240- 04:49.000* :  is imperative. And this is also being breached.
*04:49.720- 04:55.620* :  Huda is in her early 20s and is currently sheltering along with her aunt and 50 other family members
*04:55.620- 05:03.280* :  in Gaza. She says she's staying put. Me and all of my family members are still at their homes
*05:03.700- 05:10.200* :  because now we're hearing Gaza is safe. So we cannot evacuate because we don't have
*05:11.200- 05:20.800* :  any shelters when we go to the southern of Gaza Strip. So if we go there, we stay at streets.
*05:20.800- 05:30.800* :  So because of that, we decide to stay at our home without any evacuation. And regarding the water
*05:31.120- 05:37.200* :  bathrooms actually, we hear the situation is so difficult to describe.
*05:37.940- 05:42.300* :  Well, let's know here from Gasant Abu Sittar, a British Palestinian doctor volunteering in the
*05:42.300- 05:47.840* :  El Chifa Hospital in the northern part of Gaza. He spoke to the BBC about the injuries he's
*05:47.840- 05:55.260* :  treating. It's all blast injuries, which means that there are these horrendous injuries with
*05:56.140- 06:04.580* :  traplonal burns and fallen masonry. People being dug out from underneath the road of their homes.
*06:04.620- 06:11.100* :  40% of the wounded that are coming are children. And unfortunately, some of these children that
*06:11.100- 06:16.180* :  are being dug out from underneath the rubble are the soul survivors from their families.
*06:16.740- 06:23.920* :  And every day we have these cases. I'll stay until there's a ceasefire. I can't now turn my back
*06:23.920- 06:30.580* :  on my patients. I can't turn my back on my colleagues. Israeli military say around half a million
*06:30.580- 06:36.040* :  Palestinians have moved following its order to leave northern Gaza as preparations continue for
*06:36.040- 06:42.000* :  a ground offensive in retaliation for the attack by Hamas nine days ago that killed 1400 people.
*06:42.680- 06:47.680* :  Nearly 2,700 people in Gaza have been killed in Israel's retaliatory bombardment.
*06:48.140- 06:52.400* :  It's now been confirmed by Israeli authorities that the number of people abducted by Hamas
*06:52.740- 06:58.500* :  was 199. For a brief half hour on Monday morning, there were suggestions of a ceasefire,
*06:58.500- 07:03.520* :  but that was soon ruled out by both Hamas and Israel. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hector is
*07:03.520- 07:08.960* :  a spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Force. We are preparing ourselves to the mission that we
*07:08.960- 07:17.640* :  declared to destroy the Hamas infrastructure. Hamas equals ISIL. This will never happen to us again.
*07:18.000- 07:23.520* :  We are very aware and we're doing everything we can on the humanitarian effort. We've already taken
*07:23.980- 07:31.160* :  out a Bilal El-Kadra who was responsible for the Kibbutz-Mirin massacre. Head of the Nukhba forces in the south.
*07:31.860- 07:36.880* :  Last night Mu'atez, Id, Commander of Hamas National Security, we're going after their people,
*07:36.880- 07:39.740* :  and we're going after their infrastructure. That's all I can say.
*07:40.140- 07:43.540* :  The voice there of Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hector, well just before recording this
*07:43.540- 07:46.880* :  podcast, I got an update from Yola now on the movement of aid.
*07:47.400- 07:53.260* :  Well, there was a source of the petroleum authority in Gaza that told us of the BBC that there were
*07:53.260- 07:59.880* :  150,000 litres of fuel that were transferred earlier from an old tank that was designated for
*07:59.880- 08:04.220* :  storing Egyptian fuel, and this was carried out in coordination with the United Nations.
*08:04.220- 08:09.580* :  And that fuel, we know, has been sent to water and wastewater pumping stations.
*08:10.120- 08:17.240* :  And just a reflection of how awful the situation has become in Gaza that even when Israel said
*08:17.240- 08:24.960* :  that it would turn on a limited water supply a day ago, there was no fuel to run the pumps so
*08:24.960- 08:30.560* :  that people could get that water. And at the same time, the desalination station had to stop working
*08:30.560- 08:35.440* :  because it had run out of fuel. And then there's also these reports were getting of sewage coming
*08:35.440- 08:40.460* :  up into the streets. Obviously, a huge health hazard. So wastewater pumping stations should also
*08:40.980- 08:46.180* :  get some of this fuel, but it's really just a token effort at the moment. And it's very strange
*08:46.180- 08:51.200* :  because if you look at some of the footage that there is circulating, you can see that on the
*08:51.200- 08:56.580* :  Egyptian side of the RAFA crossing, there are just these long lines of lorries that the UN and
*08:56.920- 09:02.720* :  other donor countries around the region have sent hundreds of tons of aid, but it can't go in.
*09:02.900- 09:07.480* :  And on the Gaza side, there's a lot of frustration building as some of the people with foreign
*09:07.480- 09:12.120* :  passports, Palestinians with foreign passports, been waiting for days now hoping to leave. And there
*09:12.120- 09:17.820* :  was this word yesterday when the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Cairo talking to them.
*09:17.820- 09:21.840* :  There was an expectation that the RAFA crossing would open very soon and the aid would go in.
*09:22.300- 09:29.020* :  Now he's here in Jerusalem meeting Israeli officials talking to them about a mechanism for
*09:29.020- 09:33.800* :  getting aid in. And what the Israelis have been insisting on up to now is that they want to see
*09:33.800- 09:40.260* :  their citizens, people who were snatched by Hamas taken hostage to be released as any part of a
*09:40.260- 09:45.680* :  deal to let aid into Gaza. And we're also saying whilst these efforts from Antony Blinken are on
*09:45.680- 09:50.700* :  going that the United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths is also heading to the region.
*09:50.700- 09:55.880* :  He said he was deep in negotiations to try and get some aid into the Gaza strip.
*09:56.160- 10:00.900* :  That's right. It's just such an urgent situation. The clock is really ticking here.
*10:01.260- 10:06.800* :  And aid is desperately needed. It's been for many people days now that they've gone
*10:06.800- 10:14.820* :  without having food imports into the Gaza strip without having water sent into the
*10:14.820- 10:19.080* :  Gaza strip without electricity. And all of this is set against the backdrop of a
*10:19.280- 10:24.520* :  looming ground offensive by the Israeli forces, which would surely worsen the situation.
*10:25.320- 10:31.680* :  Indeed. And we're expecting this to be really a ground offensive on a on a scale that we have
*10:31.680- 10:36.920* :  never seen before. And massing at the borders, we can see the tanks there, armoured vehicles as
*10:36.920- 10:41.120* :  well. But it will be an extremely dangerous operation for Israel to have so many
*10:41.120- 10:45.920* :  boots on the ground. And Hamas, of course, have been coming out saying that they're ready to pay
*10:45.920- 10:51.260* :  with blood that they will not give up the BBC's Eolan now. So as we've just been hearing
*10:51.260- 10:56.320* :  then from Eolan, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Jerusalem after a weekend
*10:56.320- 11:02.340* :  of shuttling between Arab states. He's been holding more talks with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*11:02.940- 11:07.400* :  Our Middle East analyst is the BBC's Sebastian Usher. I asked him what Mr Blinken's strategy
*11:07.820- 11:11.260* :  might be. Well, he's trying to achieve several things. As far as Israel is concerned,
*11:11.260- 11:17.380* :  it was Israel that he landed in last Thursday when he came to the region. It's to show Israel 100%
*11:17.380- 11:24.160* :  that the US has their back, but it supports them in their self-defense as the US and Israel paint
*11:24.160- 11:30.520* :  what they're doing. But to send the message that they need to act within limits, within proportionality
*11:30.520- 11:35.240* :  as much as possible. So that's very much the public message and that's the message that he would have
*11:35.240- 11:41.100* :  been taken to the Arab states, but he's just been, you heard Egypt, he was in Saudi Arabia, the UAE,
*11:41.100- 11:48.000* :  Bahrain, Jordan, all of which countries still support strongly the Palestinian issue,
*11:48.000- 11:53.540* :  although in terms of the main issue at the forefront of Arab concerns, it had fallen away
*11:53.540- 11:58.780* :  for some time. And we've seen Bahrain, the UAE, for example, signed the Abraham Accords Normalization
*11:59.180- 12:03.820* :  with Israel, Saudi Arabia, look to be on the road towards that. Jordan, historically, of course,
*12:03.820- 12:10.500* :  and Egypt have had long-term peace deals with Israel. So as message to them, two things, I think,
*12:10.660- 12:18.260* :  one, to try and stay united in terms of support for Palestinians, but not an aggressive condemnation
*12:18.260- 12:23.000* :  of what Israel is doing for now. He would like to get a very strong condemnation of Hamas from
*12:23.000- 12:26.960* :  them, but I don't think that's what he's has got or is likely to get. But more importantly,
*12:26.960- 12:32.500* :  the spillover into the region to get those states to use their contacts, use their influence
*12:32.500- 12:38.440* :  to try and ensure that the non-state groups, such as Hasbola, for example, notice he didn't go to
*12:38.440- 12:45.120* :  Lebanon, but also other groups in the region, to some extent, the feeling amongst Arab people
*12:45.120- 12:49.220* :  on the street, we've seen big protests all over the world, that is rising all the time, there's a
*12:49.680- 12:54.400* :  disconnect between what ordinary Arabs feel about this and what the Arab states are presenting,
*12:54.400- 12:59.860* :  and that's a problem for these Arab states. So essentially, his message will be to everyone is
*12:59.860- 13:06.800* :  to hold fast, hold firm, and hopefully, after this is over, when it's over, there'll be a chance
*13:06.840- 13:11.060* :  to try to realign the way they're in the Middle East and maybe get back to some serious
*13:11.060- 13:15.840* :  negotiation discussion about the two-state solution in that Saudi Arabia, like you'd be the
*13:15.840- 13:20.580* :  absolute key role. Sebastian Usher there. Well, let's take you to northern Israel now, where,
*13:20.580- 13:26.080* :  as a precautionary measure, authorities are evacuating 28 communities within two kilometers
*13:26.080- 13:31.020* :  of the Lebanese border. The BBC's Hugo Pache here is in southern Lebanon and gave me an update
*13:31.020- 13:37.420* :  on the Israeli withdrawals. I think this is the Israeli reaction to the escalating violence along
*13:37.420- 13:43.800* :  the Israeli Lebanese border, so the Israeli authorities have announced the evacuation of 28
*13:43.800- 13:49.880* :  communities in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon. We still don't know whether this is a
*13:49.880- 13:56.100* :  mandatory evacuation, whether this is a voluntary evacuation. Obviously, many residents have already
*13:56.100- 14:01.860* :  left those areas because of the violence, and one of these communities is the community of
*14:02.040- 14:07.980* :  Stuller, where yesterday one man was killed. The first Israeli civilian to die as a result of
*14:08.340- 14:14.100* :  his ballast strike in this war, and this announcement, which was made this morning, this announcement
*14:14.100- 14:21.280* :  by the Israeli authorities, came after the most intense exchange of fire between Israel and
*14:21.280- 14:29.100* :  Hasbola yesterday. And Israel said that overnight it attacked a military infrastructure used by
*14:29.100- 14:37.340* :  Hasbola here in Lebanon. So the real fear here that this war between Israel and Hamas could spread
*14:37.340- 14:43.260* :  across the region to include Hasbola in Lebanon. You say they're that real fear. It's worth noting,
*14:43.260- 14:49.820* :  these Hasbola fighters and militants that operate in Lebanon. As a group, it's arsenal,
*14:49.820- 14:54.120* :  it's weaponry, it dwarfs some small countries. It's incredibly powerful.
*14:55.360- 15:01.640* :  And I think that's why the concern here that Hasbola could become more involved in this conflict.
*15:01.640- 15:08.000* :  It has tens of thousands of fighters with a combat experience. Many of them were fighting in Syria.
*15:08.000- 15:16.400* :  The group has 150,000 missiles and rockets, including missiles that could strike deep inside
*15:16.400- 15:24.660* :  Israeli territory. So Hasbola is much more powerful than Hamas. So I think that's why all
*15:24.660- 15:30.220* :  players here are incredibly concerned that Hasbola could become more involved in this conflict.
*15:30.220- 15:37.040* :  And I think that's why we're seeing a reaction from Western countries, the UK, the US,
*15:37.560- 15:42.860* :  warning against an escalation in this conflict. And obviously Hasbola is supported by Iran.
*15:42.860- 15:50.660* :  So we've seen that some Western leaders have been trying to warn Iran against an escalation,
*15:50.660- 15:57.280* :  against a larger involvement of Hasbola in this conflict. So I think everybody's paying attention
*15:57.280- 16:01.600* :  to Hasbola, but also to Tehran to see which decisions are going to be made.
*16:02.060- 16:06.780* :  Hugo Bashega in southern Lebanon. Well, the last nine days have shaken them at least,
*16:06.860- 16:11.700* :  but it's a conflict that's been going on for seven decades and many are desperate for long-term
*16:11.700- 16:16.420* :  change. Clive Myri has been speaking to one family, living in the shadow of the past.
*16:16.960- 16:20.180* :  I do remember that always being away and always doing something important.
*16:20.560- 16:26.740* :  Avihai is a 28-year-old engineer who could soon be deployed to Gaza with Israeli army.
*16:27.200- 16:32.400* :  His father, Idhul, served in Gaza with the defense forces back in 2005.
*16:33.260- 16:37.680* :  He believed it was right for Israel to pull out of the occupied territory that year,
*16:37.680- 16:43.700* :  allowing the Palestinians to govern themselves. He deeply believed in this move. He also passed
*16:43.700- 16:49.500* :  this feeling on to me. Apparently we're wrong, all of us. The Jewish people were supposed to be
*16:49.500- 16:55.420* :  safe in Israel. They believed there'd be no more mass murder living in their own land.
*16:55.840- 16:58.920* :  But last week's attack resurrected painful ghosts.
*16:59.980- 17:06.860* :  In 1947, after the United Nations recommended the partition of the land known as Palestine
*17:06.860- 17:14.120* :  into two states, one for Arabs, one for Jews. Israel declared independence the following year.
*17:14.580- 17:20.680* :  But the Arab world never accepted the new state, with at least 750,000 Palestinians
*17:20.680- 17:25.020* :  forced from their homes. Many ending up as refugees in Gaza.
*17:27.340- 17:33.560* :  Multiple conflicts came and went. Battles for the return of their rightful lands say the Arabs,
*17:33.560- 17:40.280* :  struggles for survival say the Israeli. War broke out again between neighboring Arab states in
*17:40.280- 17:47.980* :  Israel in 1967. Israel won the six-day war, with a million Palestinians now under Israeli control,
*17:47.980- 17:54.980* :  including those in the seized territory of Gaza. The following years saw the Palestinians
*17:54.980- 17:59.960* :  refuse to accept the occupation that were uprisings and suicide bombing attacks,
*17:59.960- 18:06.300* :  as Israel held on to occupied land building new Jewish settlements. But eventually,
*18:06.300- 18:12.040* :  Israel withdrew, dismantling the settlements and pulling out troops in 2005.
*18:13.100- 18:18.820* :  From this moment on, the responsibility for all that takes place in Gaza St.
*18:18.860- 18:27.280* :  lays on the Palestinians. It was a mistake what it did. What can I say to those 1500 people that
*18:27.280- 18:32.000* :  was murdered now that I supported this? This wouldn't have happened if we wouldn't withdraw.
*18:32.840- 18:39.140* :  Edo prayed things would have been different in Gaza. But in 2006, the islamists of Hamas,
*18:39.560- 18:45.000* :  won elections in the territory, sparking a brief civil war with their secular Palestinian rivals
*18:45.000- 18:53.820* :  fat. Hamas eventually took control and having never accepted Israel's right to exist.
*18:54.460- 19:00.340* :  The islamists continued to attack the Jews, Palestinian government in the morning firing rockets
*19:00.340- 19:06.180* :  and kidnapping soldiers and civilians, while Israel continued to build on occupied land in the
*19:06.180- 19:12.760* :  West Bank, captured by Israel in 1967. Attempts to make peace in the 90s failed and Israel put Gaza
*19:12.760- 19:19.180* :  under blockade and launched a number of ground offensives into the territory. After last week's
*19:19.180- 19:26.700* :  atrocity, troops are poised to enter once again. Palestinians are also war weary, but is determined
*19:26.700- 19:34.760* :  as Edo and Avichai to battle on in a conflict where it seems no one wins. That report there by
*19:34.760- 19:40.080* :  Clive Myreep. And just worth noting that we are still taking questions from another special edition
*19:40.080- 19:45.280* :  of the Global News Podcast. No questions are off limits. Nothing is too simple nor too complicated.
*19:45.280- 19:51.300* :  So please do drop us an email. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk
*19:54.320- 19:58.060* :  Still to come in the podcast, cricket and squash are among the new sports added for the
*19:58.060- 20:08.460* :  Olympic Games in Los Angeles in five years' time. Do you ever feel a bit overwhelmed when you
*20:08.460- 20:15.560* :  check the news on your phone first thing in the morning? I'm Hannah, I'm the presenter of What
*20:15.560- 20:20.160* :  in the World from the BBC World Service. We're the podcast making sense of the world around you,
*20:20.440- 20:25.000* :  so you can feel better about what's happening and understand what in the world is going on.
*20:25.160- 20:30.140* :  Net Zero means we're not adding any more greenhouse gases to the total in the atmosphere.
*20:30.260- 20:33.720* :  Just search for what in the world wherever you get to your bbc podcasts.
*20:36.420- 20:39.900* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast and let's look at some of the other events taking
*20:39.900- 20:44.540* :  place around the world. Four Ukrainian children are being reunited with their families
*20:45.060- 20:50.020* :  in a pilot scheme to return more of the thousands abducted by Russia since its full-scale
*20:50.020- 20:55.400* :  invasion last year. This all follows mediation by the Gulf State of Qatar, our security correspondent
*20:55.400- 21:00.900* :  Frank Gardner reports. Quietly behind the scenes, Qatar has been working with both Russia and
*21:00.900- 21:05.540* :  Ukraine to help resolve one of the most painful consequences of Russia's invasion.
*21:05.540- 21:10.720* :  Kiev says up to 700,000 of its children have been forcibly separated from their families,
*21:11.340- 21:16.240* :  taken across the border into Russia and brainwashed into forgetting all about their Ukrainian heritage.
*21:17.040- 21:22.200* :  During the summer, Qatar's Prime Minister visited both countries after a request from Ukraine
*21:22.200- 21:26.780* :  to act as a mediator. Now the first group of Ukrainian children are being returned
*21:26.780- 21:33.860* :  with help from the Kuttery Embassy in Moscow. Their ages range from 2 to 17 and their families
*21:33.860- 21:39.300* :  are from different parts of Ukraine. That report by Frank Gardner. The strongest party to
*21:39.300- 21:43.520* :  merge from the Polish General Election is unlikely to form the next government,
*21:43.520- 21:48.280* :  following Sunday's vote, the governing law and justice party is predicted to have one more
*21:48.280- 21:53.420* :  seats than the main opposition's civic coalition, but it doesn't look as if it were able to stay in
*21:53.420- 21:58.580* :  office. The civic coalition is being led by the former head of the EU Council, Donald Tusk,
*21:58.580- 22:03.020* :  who could be on course to become the next Prime Minister. So then, what does this all mean for
*22:03.020- 22:08.360* :  Poland and for the EU? I heard more from our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford.
*22:08.940- 22:13.000* :  While the count is still very much underway, there's around about a third of the votes have been
*22:13.000- 22:18.300* :  counted. And as you mentioned, the governing law and justice party or peace are winning in
*22:18.300- 22:24.000* :  terms of the single party to get the most votes, but they currently, and according to the exit polls,
*22:24.000- 22:30.220* :  too, will not have enough to form a majority, and it is all the more liberal and centrist
*22:30.220- 22:35.800* :  opposition parties who are inclined to come together and form a coalition, who would then have a
*22:35.800- 22:41.080* :  majority in Parliament. Obviously, we're a long way from the final results, but the exit polls have
*22:41.140- 22:46.160* :  been accurate in the past, and we've now had three exit polls, all of them essentially giving
*22:46.160- 22:51.680* :  the same picture. And I think it kind of tallies with the turnout as well. Another of the key figures
*22:51.680- 22:58.240* :  in this election, we're talking about a 73% turnout figure, which is the highest turnout for an
*22:58.240- 23:04.280* :  election since the fall of communism, which I think just illustrates how people in Poland have
*23:04.280- 23:08.720* :  seen this as a really extremely important vote. It's been painted, and it was painted throughout
*23:08.720- 23:14.340* :  the election campaign as a historic moment, a time for polls to choose the direction their country
*23:14.340- 23:21.940* :  takes. Would it be moving away from European values away from its ties with the EU? In fact, there's
*23:22.120- 23:25.600* :  more problems in the relationship with the EU that have been in recent years? Or would it be kind of
*23:25.600- 23:30.480* :  coming back on track in that sense, in terms of basic democratic principles, including the rule of
*23:30.480- 23:36.300* :  law, which the EU has big questions about here in Poland? So lots and lots of issues at stake,
*23:36.300- 23:42.880* :  a very divisive election, a very polarized campaign, but it does look at this point, and certainly
*23:42.880- 23:48.140* :  this is the way the opposition are painting it, it does look like they're on course for a majority
*23:48.140- 23:54.000* :  in Parliament, but there's a long way to go in a lot of wrangling and political negotiations to
*23:54.000- 23:57.900* :  be done before we're anywhere near the finish line here. And central to the opposition coalition
*23:57.980- 24:02.980* :  is Donald Tusk, of course, who was president of the European Council from 2014 to 2019. So at the
*24:02.980- 24:09.040* :  heart of the European project, this will surely be welcomed by near neighbours and by the European
*24:09.040- 24:13.700* :  Union. Yes, I think it absolutely would be. It's interesting, you know, throughout this very
*24:13.700- 24:18.900* :  vitriolic campaign, in fact, the governing party piece had been presenting Donald Tusk as a foreign
*24:18.900- 24:23.820* :  agent, almost, well, in fact, specifically a foreign stooge, even a traitor. They talked about him
*24:23.820- 24:29.120* :  as a German. They talked about him as a puppet of Europe. They tried to paint him as an enemy
*24:29.500- 24:33.040* :  of this country, but, you know, talking to people at the polls, it was interesting to see that a
*24:33.040- 24:38.100* :  lot of people felt that membership of the EU and good relations with the EU was extremely important.
*24:38.180- 24:42.260* :  And I think that was particularly important for young people here in Poland, and they have turned
*24:42.260- 24:46.460* :  out in very large numbers to vote, and they have generally, if you look at the results so far,
*24:46.460- 24:50.720* :  they have generally been voting for the opposition. So I think, you know, Poland's relations with EU
*24:50.960- 24:54.380* :  are absolutely fundamental to people here and the values that the EU represents.
*24:54.380- 24:59.720* :  Serra reigns for the reporting. Let's take you to Ecuador now, where Daniel Noboa has won the
*24:59.720- 25:04.380* :  second round of the presidential election after a tight race against the left-wing politician,
*25:04.380- 25:09.440* :  Luisa Gonzalez. The campaign was marred by violence that culminated in the murder of an
*25:09.440- 25:15.580* :  anti-corruption candidate in August. At just 35 years old, Mr. Noboa, is the youngest ever present
*25:15.580- 25:20.260* :  elect of the country. Addressing his supporters in the seaside town of Alon, he vowed to rebuild
*25:20.260- 25:28.560* :  and restore peace. Tomorrow, we start work for this new Ecuador. We start working to rebuild
*25:28.560- 25:34.860* :  a country seriously battered by violence, by corruption, and by hate. From tomorrow, hope
*25:34.860- 25:40.160* :  we'll start working. For more on Daniel Noboa, my colleague Alex Ritson spoke to the BBC's
*25:40.160- 25:44.900* :  Annamarie Rua, who's in the capital, Quito. He's a businessman, graduated from Harvard,
*25:45.460- 25:50.440* :  and is the son of one of the richest man in Ecuador, Alba Donovoa, who tried also to be
*25:50.440- 25:56.140* :  president in five occasions, failing all. Daniel Noboa is promising firm hand against
*25:56.140- 26:02.100* :  insecurity in Ecuador, with measures like the militarization of prisons and borders,
*26:02.140- 26:08.600* :  and flotant prisons also to isolate the most violent prisoners. He also wants to create jobs
*26:08.600- 26:13.540* :  to achieve these, he says, he wants to strengthen the private sector and reduce taxes.
*26:14.100- 26:19.160* :  His critic says that he doesn't have much experience to be a president. He has a short career
*26:19.160- 26:25.700* :  of two years as a member of the last congress. So is that violence which culminated in the murder
*26:26.000- 26:30.780* :  of one of the rival candidates back in August? Is that violence in society the biggest
*26:30.780- 26:37.260* :  challenge he's facing? Definitely. The unprecedented security crisis this country is leading now
*26:37.260- 26:43.300* :  with a sharp rise of violence and crime in this country that used to be among the safest
*26:43.300- 26:48.060* :  countries in Latin America now is one of the most violent. So definitely this is going to be
*26:48.060- 26:54.180* :  the main challenge of the president elected Daniel Noboa. All these rise of violence is happening
*26:54.180- 26:59.580* :  in the context of kind of a boom in the production of drug and the narcotrophic in the region.
*27:00.280- 27:05.340* :  But violence is not only because of the context of narcotrophic, more than 30 percent of the
*27:05.340- 27:11.040* :  population in Ecuador is now leaving poverty or extreme poverty, and this means not access to
*27:11.040- 27:17.600* :  basic services like health system, education, but the president elected would need to negotiate
*27:17.600- 27:25.380* :  in a very, very divided parliament with his new political movement. He only has 12 of the
*27:25.380- 27:34.460* :  136 seats. So it's going to be about negotiation. And he also has not much time. This new mandate
*27:34.540- 27:42.160* :  will be over on May 2025. And we're aware of that. The International Olympic Committee has added
*27:42.160- 27:48.440* :  five more sports to the program for the Los Angeles Games in 2028, a meeting in the Indian City
*27:48.440- 27:54.540* :  Mumbai agreed to include cricket, which has a huge fanbase across South Asia. Alex Campstake reports.
*27:54.540- 28:00.240* :  There was overwhelming support for the inclusion of cricket in the 2028 Olympics. It's an
*28:00.240- 28:05.720* :  opportunity for the game to expand in the US market and beyond. While the IOC will welcome the
*28:05.720- 28:11.420* :  extra viewers and broadcast income from the cricket mad South Asian subcontinent, especially India.
*28:11.920- 28:16.180* :  Cricket will be joined by a non-contact form of American football called flag football,
*28:16.180- 28:21.660* :  both baseball and softball lacrosse. And after years of frustration in its bid for Olympic
*28:21.660- 28:28.600* :  recognition, squash has finally made it. Alex Campstake. And finally, the lava lamp is 60.
*28:29.200- 28:33.180* :  What you may ask, well, here's Rachel Wright with everything you ever wanted to know or needed
*28:33.180- 28:40.020* :  about a lava lamp. Sold around the world, it's a British icon, described by the manufacturers as a
*28:40.020- 28:45.880* :  sleek metallic silhouette, which encases a glass lamp shaped a little like a rocket, my words,
*28:45.880- 28:52.380* :  not theirs. With colourful globules of, well, as it turns out, wax eerily floating around in
*28:52.380- 28:57.760* :  liquid. The British pop band Durand Durand even brought out a record in its honour.
*29:04.160- 29:09.240* :  And now the band have designed an autographed, pink limited edition in honour of the lava lamp
*29:09.240- 29:17.000* :  60th birthday, only 600, which have all sold out. Its inventor was a former RAF pilot called Edward
*29:17.000- 29:23.060* :  Craven Walker, who became a pioneer in naturest films, especially underwater ones featuring
*29:23.060- 29:30.060* :  naturally naked people. Then one day, in 1963, he walked into a pub in southern England and saw
*29:30.060- 29:36.940* :  a kind of egg-timer object filled with two liquids, oil and water, which don't mix. So instead,
*29:36.940- 29:43.480* :  the oil formed blobs and swirls. Craven Walker realised that lamps were not just a source of light,
*29:43.480- 29:48.740* :  but a source of art. His wife Susan says he was obsessed with his new invention.
*29:49.100- 29:55.180* :  Most of his life, he spent trying to perfect it, and then tested it, and tested it, and we tested it,
*29:55.180- 30:02.060* :  drove him out. Every step of the way, he was snubbed or came against a brick wall, but he just kept
*30:02.060- 30:07.980* :  going, kept going. The lava lamp took off as a cultural 60s icon after it is bought by Ringo
*30:07.980- 30:15.000* :  Star, drummer of the Beatles in 1963. It also appeared in iconic British productions such as Dr. Who
*30:15.000- 30:21.340* :  and the prisoner, almost displayed in David Bowie and Paul McCartney videos. Despite a recent drop in
*30:21.340- 30:27.140* :  sales, the variously shaped lamps with their multicolored globules are considered a British design
*30:27.140- 30:33.100* :  classic and a collector's item. So happy birthday to the lava lamp. In the words of its inventor
*30:33.100- 30:39.720* :  who died in 2000, the lava lamp is like the circle of life. It grows, breaks up, falls down,
*30:39.720- 30:43.680* :  and then starts all over again. That report there by Rachel Bright.
*30:46.520- 30:50.240* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast a
*30:50.240- 30:53.620* :  little later. If you want to comment on this one or any of the topics, send us an email.
*30:53.620- 31:00.300* :  The address is globalpodcasts at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on ex-act global news pod.
*31:00.720- 31:04.720* :  This edition was makes my Darcy a breather. The producer was Tracy Gordon. The editor is always
*31:04.720- 31:07.780* :  Karamartin and I'm Garry Spine. Until next time, goodbye.
