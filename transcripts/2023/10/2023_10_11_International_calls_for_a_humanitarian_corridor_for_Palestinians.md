*00:00.040- 00:03.800* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.160- 00:12.020* :  I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Thursday 12 October, these are our main stories.
*00:12.780- 00:17.160* :  International calls for Israel to allow the residents of Gaza humanitarian essentials
*00:17.160- 00:18.960* :  following days of airstrikes.
*00:19.140- 00:22.620* :  Civilians are not to blame for what Hamas has done. They didn't do anything wrong.
*00:22.680- 00:26.700* :  We are actively working on this with our Egyptian and our Israeli counterparts.
*00:27.240- 00:32.840* :  The Hamas control territory still has no power. We hear from both Israelis and Palestinians.
*00:34.920- 00:37.640* :  That is the sound we hear every night. Did you hear that?
*00:37.880- 00:44.000* :  We will see a new level of violence. Unfortunately, I think that the Hamas and also us have never really
*00:44.000- 00:49.700* :  been in this kind of situation. Hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops mass close to Gaza in
*00:49.700- 00:54.120* :  preparation for a ground-offensive following Saturday's deadly attack by Hamas.
*00:56.600- 01:02.620* :  Also in this podcast, the worst air quality in the world is now in the Brazilian Amazon,
*01:02.620- 01:09.880* :  due to deliberately started forest fires and the exponential rise of the artificial intelligence robots.
*01:13.440- 01:19.520* :  Six days after Palestinian gunmen stormed out of Gaza and killed at least 1200 Israelis,
*01:20.120- 01:25.680* :  people in the territory are now living with Israel's retaliation, the most punishing retribution
*01:25.680- 01:32.120* :  it's ever meted out for an attack by Hamas. And an impending ground war will only make life even
*01:32.120- 01:39.040* :  more unbearable. Israeli fighter jets hit another 200 Hamas targets on Wednesday and parts of Gaza
*01:39.040- 01:44.840* :  have been reduced to rubble. As you heard in our earlier podcast, the Seoul Power Station has now run
*01:44.840- 01:50.440* :  out of fuel and stopped working, leaving more than 2 million garsans without electricity unless
*01:50.440- 01:56.280* :  they have functioning generators. The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called
*01:56.280- 02:03.040* :  for crucial supplies to be allowed into Gaza and for people taking captive on Saturday to be freed.
*02:03.540- 02:08.760* :  I call for the immediate release of all Israeli hostages held in Gaza.
*02:09.760- 02:15.860* :  About 20,000 Palestinians are now sheltered in 92 UN facilities across Gaza.
*02:17.140- 02:23.360* :  UN premises and all hospitals, schools and clinics must never be targeted. UN staff are working
*02:23.360- 02:29.360* :  around the clock to support the people of Gaza and I deeply regret that some of my colleagues
*02:29.660- 02:36.540* :  have already paid the ultimate price. An Egyptian security official has told the BBC that
*02:36.540- 02:42.560* :  they are directly involved in urgent discussions with the UN and the US to achieve a humanitarian
*02:42.560- 02:49.160* :  truth to allow aid and food in. In a moment, we will hear from our correspondent in Jerusalem on
*02:49.160- 02:54.200* :  some big developments there. But first, this report from our correspondent, Dan Johnson,
*02:54.360- 03:03.380* :  it begins in Gaza. You see, these sounds are the sounds of missiles. The birds are even scared.
*03:04.200- 03:10.140* :  We are all scared here. This is Gaza's bombardment, described by one of its youngest witnesses,
*03:10.900- 03:17.680* :  shared via social media. That is the sound we hear every night. Did you hear that?
*03:18.600- 03:24.280* :  I'm scared. I'm about to cry from how terrifying this is. I was scared for my brother.
*03:24.280- 03:30.660* :  I hugged him tightly. Tell him it's going to be okay. Children are casualties of this conflict
*03:30.660- 03:38.840* :  in Israel and in Gaza. And Nadine Abdul Atif, only just a teenager, carries the heavy weight of
*03:38.880- 03:44.920* :  war. Imagine a 13-year-old having to show the world how much we are suffering. I should be in school
*03:44.940- 03:50.320* :  learning. My legs are shaking. My hands are shaking. My whole world is shaking.
*03:53.200- 03:58.960* :  When she last spoke to us, Hollywood NASA was showing the world Gaza's unexpected beauty on
*03:58.960- 04:04.080* :  Instagram. Now, she sent us voice notes. Fearful, there'll be nothing left.
*04:04.500- 04:10.040* :  In fact, the beautiful image of Gaza that I used to photograph and document over the past
*04:10.060- 04:15.660* :  years and show to the world is now marked with the gray color, destruction, the smell of smoke
*04:15.660- 04:21.240* :  and blood, the corpses of children and civilians in their destroyed houses, where they have got
*04:21.240- 04:26.580* :  the best of memories and dreams. Right, guys? What is our favorite game that we like to play together?
*04:26.580- 04:33.020* :  Sonny. Sonny. 50 miles up the coast in Israel. I met another family holding each other tight.
*04:33.020- 04:39.420* :  This is precious time for Moa Numburg. Back all this my getaway bag. It's a marketing executive
*04:39.420- 04:44.760* :  for Red Bull who's now getting ready to do his duty as a reserve tank technician.
*04:45.500- 04:52.220* :  We will see a new level of violence, unfortunately. I think that also the Hamas and also us have never
*04:52.220- 04:58.180* :  really been in this kind of situation. In the first two days, my hatred was for everyone, but
*04:58.700- 05:02.680* :  I know that also a lot of Palestine on the other side are suffering as well. There are a lot of
*05:02.680- 05:06.640* :  innocent people there, but at the end of the day, you know, you have to choose your sign.
*05:06.640- 05:11.820* :  When you are faced in the eye of evil, you need to react and you need to react strong and
*05:11.880- 05:20.680* :  Israel will prevail. This is one of the police stations that's now a missing person's
*05:20.680- 05:26.420* :  bureau. Relatives are gathering here, they're giving over details of their loved ones and
*05:26.420- 05:32.820* :  offering up DNA samples in hope that they can get a match, that they can at least get some news.
*05:32.820- 05:40.360* :  They've registered more than 500 cases here already. Efrat Hermel Tsar is one of the volunteers here,
*05:40.600- 05:46.600* :  a social worker. The bodies that the police is getting in shapes that it's very hard,
*05:47.600- 05:53.480* :  so there's no humanity here in any aspect. It's a terror. We're hoping, we're hoping, we're trying
*05:53.480- 06:04.400* :  to hold the hope that we know that for many. As we're speaking, a family has just emerged
*06:04.400- 06:13.660* :  clearly having received the worst possible news. I'm told they have just had confirmation that
*06:13.660- 06:23.300* :  their son was killed. Dan Johnson with that report. Before Tsar Today's attack, Israel was
*06:23.300- 06:28.080* :  divided as never before, as Mr Netanyahu's government forged ahead with controversial
*06:28.080- 06:34.380* :  changes to the judiciary, which led to months of protests. Now, the country is uniting and the
*06:34.380- 06:39.700* :  Prime Minister and the main opposition leader, Benny Gantz, have agreed to form an emergency
*06:39.900- 06:44.120* :  government which should be sworn in on Thursday. Mr Gantz has been speaking.
*06:46.440- 06:50.100* :  Our standing here together, shoulder to shoulder, is a message to our enemies,
*06:50.100- 06:56.160* :  and most importantly to all citizens of Israel. At this time, we are all Israel soldiers.
*06:56.160- 07:02.840* :  It's time to be together and win. Our correspondent in Jerusalem, John Donerson, told me what this
*07:02.840- 07:08.740* :  means. There will be a war cabinet that is set up as part of this, and they're not calling it
*07:08.740- 07:13.240* :  a government of national unity, but the calling is emergency government, and that will be made
*07:13.240- 07:18.700* :  up of Benny Gantz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defence minister, other senior ministers.
*07:18.700- 07:24.880* :  And it's significant, really, because what it means is that Benny Gantz is a more centrist figure,
*07:24.880- 07:32.040* :  and it means that they can put together a government that has a broader consensus of public support
*07:32.040- 07:37.840* :  for whatever Israel decides to do next. So it means the government will be able to make difficult
*07:38.680- 07:44.360* :  decisions more easily. It's also significant because we have probably the most right-wing
*07:44.360- 07:49.800* :  government in Israel's history, but it's also one of the least experienced. You've got a lot of
*07:49.800- 07:55.360* :  ministers in there who haven't had long careers and politics haven't had long careers in the
*07:55.360- 08:02.020* :  military. You cannot say that of Benny Gantz. He was a former army chief of staff. He was in charge
*08:02.020- 08:09.280* :  in 2014, when there were thousands of Palestinian casualties then, but he is a voice that could
*08:09.280- 08:15.420* :  temporise pose some of the more extreme views within the current Israeli government.
*08:15.620- 08:20.960* :  The military build up, though, on the border with Gaza, what do we know about that and about
*08:20.960- 08:26.460* :  this possibility of a ground offensive? We have had some comments from the IDF today saying that
*08:26.460- 08:33.760* :  forces are massing on the border, including 300,000 reservists, and that they are ready to
*08:33.760- 08:38.900* :  take on their mission. So you do get a sense that it is coming soon, but we don't know when.
*08:39.380- 08:45.780* :  John Donerson with that update from Jerusalem. The ongoing siege imposed by Israel is leading to
*08:45.780- 08:50.960* :  desperation in Gaza. There are long queues for bread at bakeries, and the health ministry there
*08:50.960- 08:55.440* :  says hospitals are overwhelmed and will run out of some medicines in a matter of hours,
*08:55.980- 09:01.440* :  more than 1100 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes in Gaza, and hundreds of thousands
*09:01.440- 09:06.160* :  have fled their homes in search of safety. On Wednesday, the White House National Security
*09:06.160- 09:12.320* :  spokesman, John Kirby, confirmed discussions were taking place with Israel and Egypt to help those
*09:12.320- 09:17.700* :  trapped in Gaza. We support safe passions for civilians. civilians are not to blame for what
*09:17.700- 09:22.020* :  Hamas has done. They didn't do anything wrong. I don't have an announcement to make today. I can't
*09:22.020- 09:25.500* :  tell you a specific route or a corridor. I just want to make it clear that we are actively
*09:25.500- 09:31.080* :  working on this with our Egyptian and our Israeli counterparts. Saudi Arabia's crown prince has
*09:31.080- 09:36.700* :  said they were making unremitting efforts regionally and internationally to jointly coordinate an
*09:36.700- 09:42.820* :  end to the ongoing escalation. On Wednesday, it was also confirmed that the UN Security Council
*09:42.820- 09:48.600* :  will be meeting on Friday to discuss the conflict between Israel and Gaza. Divina Gupta spoke to
*09:48.600- 09:54.360* :  the human rights lawyer, Zaha Hassan, who was the senior legal advisor to the Palestinian
*09:54.360- 10:01.020* :  negotiating team during their bid for UN membership in 2011. What's her assessment of the situation?
*10:01.300- 10:09.700* :  The response to the Hamas attacks are necessary to stop any further loss of civilian life. However,
*10:09.700- 10:16.960* :  it's unacceptable to bombard indiscriminately the Gaza Strip, residential apartment buildings
*10:16.960- 10:23.540* :  going down. UN facilities that are sheltering those who are fleeing the bombing, being targeted,
*10:23.540- 10:29.820* :  medical facilities being targeted. We've heard from the Israeli Defense Minister that he's going to
*10:29.820- 10:36.940* :  cut off food and water and essential services under international law. This is collective punishment.
*10:36.940- 10:44.280* :  It's a war crime. What we need to see now is an international response to pull Israel back within
*10:44.280- 10:49.180* :  the bounds of international law. But what can that international response be then? Because
*10:49.340- 10:55.840* :  the U.S. President Joe Biden described Hamas as a sold-on Israel as an act of sheer evil?
*10:56.020- 11:02.480* :  What's gotten us here has been a situation of prolonged occupation that has gone on for almost
*11:02.480- 11:08.460* :  six decades now. And in the case of Gaza in the last 16 years, it's been a siege and blockade
*11:08.460- 11:14.120* :  over the Strip where every aspect of Palestinian life has been controlled by Israel. That's why it's
*11:14.120- 11:20.740* :  so easy for Israel to cut off water and food and supplies into the Strip because it has had this
*11:20.740- 11:27.060* :  chokehold on the people. People can't go in and out of the Gaza Strip. The underlying political
*11:27.060- 11:33.580* :  issues need to be addressed and end of occupation being the most paramount and an opening up of Gaza
*11:33.580- 11:38.360* :  so that the people there can live a normal life. Who can play that role? It's going to take the
*11:38.360- 11:44.180* :  international community coming together to solve this issue once and for all. In the past,
*11:44.180- 11:51.480* :  the U.S. has played the primary role as peacemaker and facilitator. But given what we've seen in terms
*11:51.480- 11:58.640* :  of the U.S. response to the situation in Gaza currently where we haven't heard anything but an
*11:58.640- 12:04.980* :  unqualified support for Israel's right to defend itself. Even as I said, apartment buildings and
*12:05.060- 12:10.760* :  civilian infrastructure is targeted. I mean, this is not acceptable because that is just a license
*12:10.760- 12:17.420* :  for further violence. So what needs to happen is the Arab governments, the European Union and
*12:17.420- 12:23.520* :  different European countries come together to force both Palestinians and Israelis to make peace.
*12:23.520- 12:29.720* :  We haven't even been able to get a statement from the State Department spokesperson saying that the
*12:29.720- 12:35.360* :  denial of food and water and essential basic services to Palestinians is off limits.
*12:36.340- 12:43.420* :  Zaha Hassan speaking to Davina Gupta. The audacity of Hamas's attack has left Israelis still shaken
*12:43.420- 12:50.240* :  to the core. None more so than 22-year-old Shia Gollan, like hundreds of other young people. She
*12:50.240- 12:55.760* :  was attending a music festival in the Israeli desert just to the east of Gaza. It was there on
*12:55.760- 13:03.420* :  Saturday as they partied that the Hamas gunman struck 250 people were killed. Tim Franks has
*13:03.420- 13:08.000* :  been hearing her account and a warning. Parts of this interview are disturbing.
*13:09.100- 13:17.020* :  We were dancing and then there is alarm of rockets. Then the guards there was the party's over
*13:17.020- 13:23.180* :  and everybody need to go because it's dangerous. I go to get the car and then I pick up my friends
*13:23.460- 13:31.120* :  and then we drive to the exit and when we turn to the right we saw cars who were shot so we drive
*13:31.120- 13:38.440* :  to the left and in the left were terrorists too so they tell us to turn around and then the car
*13:38.440- 13:44.240* :  was stuck. We don't have a way out because there is terrorists from the right and from the left.
*13:44.420- 13:50.140* :  So what did you do? So we get out of the car really quickly and we go next to the car. We were like
*13:50.660- 13:58.040* :  30 people, 40 people. We were close to the guards. We heard shooting and then we started to run.
*13:58.500- 14:05.320* :  One of the guys there, it grabbed my arms and it started to run with me and I lose my friends.
*14:05.440- 14:12.340* :  I really couldn't go back because they were shoting everywhere and I ran into the woods.
*14:13.060- 14:18.200* :  I remember that I need to hide. I look at the bushes, look at the ground and I
*14:19.000- 14:27.440* :  get really into the ground. I put the bushes on me and I put stand, how much I can hide, I hide.
*14:27.880- 14:35.820* :  After a few minutes the terrorists was up and I hear them, I hear people screaming. I don't know
*14:35.820- 14:43.300* :  if they catch them because I was hiding. So what did you see? I see the guns, big and black
*14:43.820- 14:50.100* :  guns. They talk in English and they say, get out and take your hands up but I didn't go out
*14:50.100- 14:56.900* :  because I was so scared. But there were three children next to me that go out and then they shot
*14:56.960- 15:02.880* :  down and they fell down. I saw the children fall down. I pray to my God that save me.
*15:03.060- 15:09.300* :  There must have been an awful thing to witness. Do you have any idea how old the children were?
*15:09.880- 15:16.140* :  They were like me, they were like 20, 22. Not children, really children, but they were very young.
*15:16.460- 15:19.180* :  Yes, they didn't did nothing in their lives.
*15:23.740- 15:28.360* :  It must have been shattering to see three people killed in that way.
*15:30.360- 15:38.240* :  Sorry, I need to breathe. To my boyfriend's, to my mum's and location. I tell them I need
*15:38.540- 15:44.780* :  save because I'm going to die. I really think I'm going to die. But I know that nobody can get
*15:44.820- 15:51.360* :  here because they're like hundreds of terrorists. After a few hours, they're starting to burn
*15:51.360- 15:57.200* :  everything. I didn't know what to do because if I'm staying there, I'm just burned to death.
*15:57.760- 16:05.760* :  But if I go out, they're going to kill me. For first, I get out. I just lay there on the dead
*16:05.760- 16:13.660* :  people and that was surprising because I lay so hard about one girl that she woke up,
*16:13.660- 16:21.300* :  but I was so happy that there's someone alive with me. I try to get myself out and her because
*16:21.300- 16:28.660* :  she's hurt. I don't know how she was enough brave to run to the car, but she did it. I was scared
*16:28.660- 16:35.500* :  to go out to the car because it was like everybody can see her there and can shot her.
*16:36.700- 16:42.680* :  So I jumped to the fire. I get hurt, but not so much from the fire. I heard someone
*16:42.680- 16:50.020* :  starting to scream outside in Hebrew, but in first I thought he was a terrorist too. I'm trying to
*16:50.020- 16:57.140* :  hear if he has a kind of accident, but he didn't. So I get out and I tell him I'm here. He was like
*16:57.140- 17:04.260* :  me. It was hiding in the tree. He told me the armies already pushed them away and we need to run now.
*17:06.480- 17:11.700* :  Share Golan speaking to Tim Franks. You're listening to the Global News podcast.
*17:16.800- 17:23.560* :  Now to other news, Manaus, the largest city in Brazil's Amazon region, has reported one of the
*17:23.560- 17:29.080* :  worst air quality levels in the world because of smoke from fires in the surrounding rainforest.
*17:29.780- 17:33.420* :  The air is so bad in the city. A state of emergency has been declared.
*17:33.940- 17:37.080* :  America's regional editor Leonardo Russia told me more.
*17:37.540- 17:42.140* :  The pictures I've seen are very worrying because it looks like a desert storm
*17:42.940- 17:49.320* :  fall in the northern European city. It's all very hazy and it's surprising because you are
*17:49.320- 17:54.700* :  surrounded by rainforest all over the place. It is a city of two million people, but it's
*17:54.700- 18:00.060* :  something that even people from there don't see all the time. What you have there is a situation
*18:00.060- 18:06.040* :  that describes as hazardous, the amount of pollutants in the air, and it's part of an ongoing
*18:06.040- 18:11.280* :  environmental crisis in the area. The Amazon is going through a serious drought, the worst
*18:11.280- 18:17.700* :  possibly in three, four decades. The river levels are low. Fish have been dying and the rivers
*18:17.700- 18:23.880* :  Manaus has declared the state of emergency in more than 20 other cities, so you have the drought
*18:23.880- 18:30.400* :  that makes it easier for those people who are destroying the forest to set fire to the rainforest,
*18:30.400- 18:35.100* :  and then you have all these haze caused by the fires and the pollution and the damage to the people.
*18:35.400- 18:40.600* :  So these fires are deliberately started? They are by farmers who are clearing the land for agriculture
*18:40.600- 18:46.640* :  or use, and it's no point blaming the indigenous peoples because they use that, but in small scale,
*18:47.000- 18:51.960* :  and forests like that, you have to use controlled fires to clear the land, but the indigenous
*18:51.960- 18:59.120* :  groups and small farmers, they don't do it in that scale. We had in September, more than 25,000
*18:59.120- 19:04.720* :  fires in the Brazilian Amazon. It's almost a record high. And once they get going, it spreads.
*19:05.580- 19:10.820* :  It spreads, it's easy to get out of control, but I don't think people feel very worried about that,
*19:10.820- 19:15.220* :  because the more land they think they can get, they're happy about that. There's also a problem,
*19:15.220- 19:21.040* :  which is the land in the Amazon is very poor, the soil. So you can use it for one, two,
*19:21.040- 19:26.640* :  three years, and then you have to clear new land to continue planting or raising your cattle.
*19:27.120- 19:33.140* :  Leo Rocher. The head of NATO has said members of the Alliance are stepping up support for Ukraine
*19:33.140- 19:38.160* :  to get through what he said would be another difficult winter. Jens Stoltenberg was speaking
*19:38.160- 19:44.040* :  after a meeting of Ukraine's allies in Belgium, attended by President Zelensky. Here's Danny Aberhardt.
*19:44.320- 19:49.520* :  President Zelensky continues to push hard for better air defenses. It's having some results
*19:49.520- 19:56.260* :  with pledges from Germany, the UK, and the US in this regard. But Kiev has many potential targets
*19:56.260- 20:02.220* :  to defend, including energy infrastructure ahead of an expected renewed Russian assault this winter.
*20:02.900- 20:08.100* :  NATO Secretary-General highlighted winter gear from Canada as an example of how member states
*20:08.100- 20:13.720* :  were helping Kiev ensure its soldiers could continue to fight through the cold. Jens Stoltenberg
*20:13.720- 20:18.600* :  downplayed concerns that infighting in the US Congress and the war between Israel and Hamas
*20:18.840- 20:24.280* :  could affect armed supplies to Ukraine. NATO, he said, was strong enough to deal with more than one
*20:24.280- 20:29.520* :  challenge at the same time. But a journalist pointed out that Israel was looking to the US for
*20:29.520- 20:35.280* :  support with air defenses and ammunition, just like Ukraine, and budgetary rangles in Washington
*20:35.280- 20:43.060* :  are complicating the picture considerably. Danny Aberhardt. With French troops leaving and the withdrawal
*20:43.060- 20:49.700* :  of USA, the generals who seized power in Niger have now turned their sights on the UN. They've given
*20:49.700- 20:56.760* :  its resident coordinator an ultimatum to leave. Africa, regional editor Richard Hamilton told me why
*20:56.760- 21:02.280* :  they'd made this ultimatum. They said it was because of a snub, but that they'd not been invited
*21:02.280- 21:07.740* :  to the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, as well as other international
*21:07.840- 21:13.960* :  meetings. But I think that's an excuse, and it's really that Niger is turning its back on
*21:13.960- 21:20.840* :  western powers and the international community. And similar actions were taken in Burkina
*21:20.840- 21:26.780* :  Faso last year. The UN resident coordinator was asked to leave, and this year Marley has
*21:26.780- 21:31.760* :  terminated the United Nations mission. So they're following the same sort of pattern, and these
*21:31.760- 21:37.160* :  three countries have formed an alliance. This comes on top of French troops leaving aid being
*21:37.160- 21:42.560* :  withdrawn. Things seem to be going from bad to worse. That's right. And what's tragic about it
*21:42.600- 21:48.240* :  is that Niger was actually making a lot of progress. Jihadist violence had fallen by something
*21:48.240- 21:56.100* :  like 70%. And this was partly because the United Nations had a massive poverty alleviation program
*21:56.100- 22:01.900* :  and development program. They pour millions of dollars of aid into helping the poorest people in
*22:01.900- 22:09.260* :  Niger, and that helped stop people turning towards Jihadism and radicalization. So the irony is
*22:09.260- 22:15.000* :  that this will make people more likely to join the Islamists. It's a massive failure, and it's
*22:15.000- 22:21.300* :  really biting the hand that feeds it. Everyone expects Niger to turn towards Russia and get
*22:21.300- 22:28.300* :  in mercenaries from Wagner. But again, that could increase radicalization because the Wagner tactics
*22:28.300- 22:34.200* :  are pretty brutal, and just going around killing people indiscriminately were just encouraged
*22:34.200- 22:40.180* :  more people to join the Jihadists. So Niger is like the last domino in the Sahel that is falling,
*22:40.180- 22:45.100* :  and from a Western point of view, it's a massive failure and a complete tragedy.
*22:45.100- 22:51.840* :  Richard Hamilton. Now, let's take you back to last month when samples of an asteroid were
*22:51.840- 22:58.560* :  parachuted into America. Well, that canister, so carefully retrieved from the surface of the
*22:58.560- 23:03.940* :  asteroid Bennu, has been opened up and scientists have now revealed what it contains. Here's Bill
*23:03.940- 23:11.220* :  Nelson, the US Space Agency's administrator. The carbon and water molecules are exactly the
*23:11.220- 23:18.240* :  kinds of material that we wanted to find. They are crucial elements in the formation of our own
*23:18.260- 23:25.880* :  planet, and they're going to help us determine the origin of elements that could have led to life.
*23:25.880- 23:32.420* :  And I mentioned that one of our missions, it's actually in statute, is to look for life. That's
*23:32.420- 23:39.400* :  why we're digging on Mars. That's why we go out into the far regions of the very beginning.
*23:40.260- 23:46.340* :  A little then of what the scientists found inside, but for more, we spoke to our science correspondent
*23:46.360- 23:51.000* :  Jonathan Amos. Now, they haven't got everything out, but they've sort of kind of focused a
*23:51.000- 23:57.100* :  camera on what they can see, and it's very, very black. It kind of looks like cold dust,
*23:57.500- 24:03.380* :  and they've been able to do some initial tests, just taken some little fragments particles that
*24:03.380- 24:09.200* :  were hanging around that they could get at, and it is what they were hoping for. So this material
*24:09.200- 24:16.900* :  is carbon rich. It's about 5% carbon by mass, and it's also heavily laden with water bearing
*24:16.900- 24:23.120* :  minerals, what we call hydrated minerals, clay minerals. And so they have got an abundance of
*24:23.120- 24:29.500* :  material. It is stupendous. In that clip we heard, Bill Nelson says this sample takes us a step
*24:29.500- 24:35.680* :  closer to finding out how life on earth began. Does it? Well, the young earth was a sort of hot
*24:35.680- 24:40.680* :  boiling place, and it would have driven off all of its volatile chemistry. So how come when you
*24:40.680- 24:46.900* :  look around at the earth today, we see an awful lot of water, 70% of planet earth is covered in
*24:46.900- 24:52.180* :  water, the oceans. It's raining where I am today. Where's all that water come from? It should have
*24:52.180- 24:58.200* :  been driven off early in earth's history. So the ideas are that may be asteroids, like Benu,
*24:58.200- 25:04.600* :  way, way back four and a half billion years ago, delivered some of the water we now see around us
*25:04.820- 25:09.920* :  to our planet. That's where it may have come. Now, if that's true, then if you went to an asteroid
*25:09.920- 25:16.380* :  like Benu and brought back a sample, you'd find a lot of minerals that contain water, and that's
*25:16.380- 25:23.320* :  what we see in this sample. Another idea, Alex, is that yes, maybe life was kickstarted on earth by
*25:23.320- 25:29.640* :  asteroids delivering key carbon rich chemistry, organic chemistries would call it. And so if you go
*25:29.640- 25:34.660* :  to a place like Benu, you grab a sample, you bring it back, what you expect to find, you expect to
*25:34.660- 25:40.500* :  find complex carbon molecules. And that's precisely what we're seeing in these initial results
*25:41.000- 25:45.360* :  from the Benu sample. So it's all pointing in that direction, but they've got a lot of work to do.
*25:45.900- 25:51.660* :  Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos, for much of this year, we've been reporting on how
*25:51.660- 25:57.560* :  artificial intelligence could transform our lives. Next month, the British government is hosting
*25:57.560- 26:03.820* :  a global safety summit, discussing the risks of AI, though no one is in any doubt that it can
*26:03.820- 26:10.040* :  benefit humans from climate change to dealing with pandemics. Evan Davis has been finding out how
*26:10.040- 26:16.620* :  by visiting Google Deep Mind, part of the Google Alphabet Empire in central London.
*26:24.900- 26:29.620* :  That is actually amazing person, tell us who you are. So my name is Raya Hadzel, I'm a VP of
*26:29.620- 26:36.300* :  research at Google Deep Mind. So what we've just been looking at is two small robots
*26:36.300- 26:42.380* :  tackling each other a bit, falling over a lot, but actually really adept at getting back up
*26:42.380- 26:47.640* :  again and getting back into the game. Some of us have seen videos of robots, Boston Dynamics,
*26:47.640- 26:52.520* :  a company in the US that's programmed robots to do great dancers and things like that. This is
*26:52.520- 26:58.420* :  a little different, isn't it? It's very different because we haven't programmed any of this in at all.
*26:58.840- 27:03.460* :  They've really learned, similarly to what a child does, you're going to learn from imitation
*27:03.560- 27:07.660* :  and you're going to learn from your own experience and you're going to learn from an external reward
*27:07.660- 27:12.120* :  like saying, yeah, you got the goal, do it, you know, try to do it again. What do they consist of?
*27:12.220- 27:15.180* :  They've got little cameras in their head, is that right? Is that what I can see there?
*27:15.340- 27:20.340* :  That's right, they've got cameras, they've got a number of different joints so they can control
*27:20.340- 27:27.940* :  their arms, three joints on their legs, the torso as well. So a number of sensors and also small
*27:27.940- 27:34.860* :  motors. We're really trying to understand how robots can control not just those low-level motors,
*27:34.860- 27:40.520* :  but actually put that together into behaviors and even strategies for winning the game,
*27:40.860- 27:45.020* :  but more broadly, some of these things are used in a lot of other areas, for instance,
*27:45.020- 27:51.480* :  in understanding biology, human language and other areas. All right, well, we've left the football
*27:51.480- 27:56.480* :  playing robots. We've come just a few meters down the road into another building into the deep
*27:56.480- 28:01.840* :  mind library. If you're thinking lots and lots of books, that's not quite what it's like. It's
*28:01.840- 28:06.940* :  a rather minimalist, rather elegant library with a few books on some shelves, but I'm here with
*28:06.940- 28:12.720* :  PushMeatcoly, VP for Research at DeepMind, and PushMeat, you can talk through some of the other
*28:12.720- 28:19.680* :  things that are going on here in particular on biology. What can AI do much better than human
*28:19.680- 28:26.500* :  intelligence? So if you look at the amount of data scientists across the world are generating and
*28:26.500- 28:34.000* :  gathering about a world, there is no one single human who can comprehend it all. And so we definitely
*28:34.000- 28:41.600* :  need these tools which have these amazing abilities to not only parse this information, but try to
*28:41.600- 28:47.540* :  make sense of it. Right, let's take the biology because you have achieved something already at DeepMind,
*28:47.540- 28:53.040* :  AlphaFold. Give us the headlines of what AlphaFold was, what problem it solved.
*28:53.820- 28:58.620* :  Okay, proteins are essentially the molecular machines that make us stick. They are
*28:58.620- 29:05.620* :  Lego blocks of life. And we don't know how they all sort of work. We made this amazing advance,
*29:05.620- 29:12.340* :  which allowed people to find the structure of these proteins in a way that has never been done
*29:12.340- 29:16.980* :  before. What have you done with that knowledge? We've made this available to scientists all
*29:16.980- 29:22.480* :  across the world and they have been using it for so many different applications from developing
*29:22.480- 29:28.040* :  new vaccines, do thinking about what are the basic molecular processes that are happening in
*29:28.040- 29:34.800* :  ourselves. Is biology perhaps the most exciting area for AI? Yeah, biology is a personal favorite.
*29:34.800- 29:39.260* :  I think within the scientific community it has been a revolution. In fact, people have come to us
*29:39.260- 29:44.720* :  and said, well, I was working on this particular protein for the last 10 years. AlphaFold came
*29:45.500- 29:48.640* :  and I could find the prediction and I'm now thinking what should I do next.
*29:49.320- 29:51.240* :  That report by Evan Davis.
*29:53.620- 29:59.100* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new addition of the Global News podcast later.
*29:59.100- 30:04.700* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*30:04.700- 30:13.260* :  The address is globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on X, formerly known as Twitter,
*30:13.260- 30:20.560* :  at Global Newspod. This addition was mixed by Nick Randall and the producer was Emma Joseph.
*30:20.560- 30:25.500* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson. Until next time, goodbye.
