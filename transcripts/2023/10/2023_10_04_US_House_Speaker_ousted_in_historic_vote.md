*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.700* :  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.260- 00:23.560* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Wednesday 4th of October.
*00:24.080- 00:28.680* :  America's most senior Republican, Kevin McCarthy, becomes the first house speaker to be voted
*00:28.680- 00:34.900* :  out of office after losing support of hardliners in his own party. A bus plunges off a bridge near
*00:34.900- 00:41.140* :  Venice killing at least 21 people and NATO warns that western countries are running out of ammunition
*00:41.140- 00:47.840* :  to supply Ukraine. The bottom of the barrel is now visible and we need the industry to ramp up production.
*00:50.500- 00:56.840* :  Also in the podcast, Pakistan says all illegal migrants, including 1.7 million Afghans,
*00:56.840- 01:03.540* :  must leave by the end of the month or face deportation. And the electrons are much more like waves,
*01:03.660- 01:10.980* :  like water waves, dance and particles. How work with extremely brief pulses of light led to the
*01:10.980- 01:20.240* :  Nobel Prize for physics. The most senior Republican in the United States, House of Representatives
*01:20.240- 01:25.460* :  speaker Kevin McCarthy has been kicked out of office after eight members of his own party turned
*01:25.460- 01:30.200* :  against him. The hardliners were angry that he'd agreed to deal with the Democrats at the
*01:30.200- 01:35.960* :  weekend to avert a government shutdown. The Republicans only have a narrow majority in the house.
*01:35.960- 01:40.720* :  It took 15 rounds of voting to elect Mr McCarthy in the first place back in January.
*01:40.720- 01:45.040* :  Now he's become the first house speaker ever to be voted out of office.
*01:45.680- 01:55.160* :  The Yees are 216. The Naes are 210. The resolution is adopted. The office of Speaker of the House
*01:55.960- 02:00.600* :  of the United States House of Representatives is hereby declared vacant.
*02:02.500- 02:07.740* :  After the votes, Trump loyalist Matt Gates, who led the Republican rebels, said Mr McCarthy
*02:07.740- 02:12.920* :  had been holding back the party. The conservative agenda was being paralyzed by Speaker McCarthy.
*02:13.200- 02:19.220* :  We hadn't even sent a subpoena at 100 by our oversight was lackluster. Our spending priorities
*02:19.220- 02:24.900* :  were misaligned. The top line budget was going to lead to more inflation, more debt, more challenges.
*02:25.400- 02:30.860* :  So the best way to advance the conservative agenda is to move forward with a new speaker.
*02:32.000- 02:35.080* :  I had more from our correspondent in Washington, Sean Dilly.
*02:35.680- 02:39.240* :  This was a little bit of a surprise even to seasoned watchers who felt
*02:39.260- 02:44.580* :  fairly convinced that democratic politicians would probably grit their teeth and support
*02:44.580- 02:49.020* :  McCarthy on the basis that he was the one who said that he would deliver a separate funding
*02:49.020- 02:54.840* :  deal for Ukraine. That is thrown into massive doubt now because McCarthy, although he could stand
*02:54.840- 03:00.940* :  again in effect, he's gone. What happens now? Patrick McKenry, another member, is stepping in
*03:00.940- 03:05.940* :  essentially acting as Speaker. There are conversations happening as we're talking right now
*03:05.940- 03:11.140* :  on both parties as to who would be acceptable to the mainstream of the Republican party,
*03:11.520- 03:16.700* :  who would be acceptable to the hardliners Matt Gates among them. He's one of at least nine who
*03:16.700- 03:21.040* :  have been the thorn in Kevin McCarthy's side since he was elected, in fact, even before he was
*03:21.040- 03:26.600* :  elected. But who would be acceptable to Democrats as well? Because the central issue is limbering up
*03:26.600- 03:32.420* :  to be how much money should go to Ukraine, if any, because many of those hardliners just don't
*03:32.420- 03:36.300* :  think there should be any more money and certainly not very much more money. And as far as the
*03:36.300- 03:39.240* :  Democrats are concerned, well, they've been promised that if they kept the government open,
*03:39.240- 03:43.940* :  that's what would be delivered. This, though, what you're seeing in Capitol Hill now is what happens
*03:43.960- 03:48.020* :  when different parties rule different bits of government and they really don't much like each
*03:48.020- 03:54.400* :  other. And who are the possible candidates who can hold the narrow Republican majority together?
*03:54.660- 03:58.620* :  There's nobody who jumps out. I tell you who it won't be, though, it won't be Matt Gates.
*03:58.620- 04:04.680* :  It won't be Marjorie Telegreen. It won't be any of the usual suspects who have forced the shutdown
*04:04.680- 04:09.860* :  talks in the first place to need to be averted. Because look, a deal was struck between Joe Biden and
*04:09.860- 04:15.260* :  the White House and Kevin McCarthy and Republicans. All the way back in May, they wanted between
*04:15.260- 04:20.220* :  to avoid the usual drama that you get here in Capitol Hill, where you face these 11th-hour
*04:20.220- 04:25.940* :  deals. But at the moment, there literally is no obvious candidate as being acceptable to Democrats
*04:25.940- 04:30.060* :  and Republicans. Everybody's reasonably surprised that they're even having to ask this question,
*04:30.340- 04:34.180* :  because some Democrats didn't even know whether they would be supporting McCarthy or not. Not
*04:34.180- 04:38.240* :  until, I keep Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives gave them
*04:38.240- 04:43.260* :  their marching orders. And what does this mean for funding for Ukraine? No business can get done
*04:43.260- 04:49.460* :  until a new speaker is installed. That funding is choked off at a time when President Zelensky says
*04:49.460- 04:55.060* :  they urgently need help. Sean Dilly in Washington and the White House says President Biden hopes
*04:55.060- 05:00.120* :  the House of Representatives will quickly elect a speaker because of the urgent challenges
*05:00.120- 05:07.280* :  facing the nation. On Monday, EU foreign ministers met in Kiev to reaffirm their backing for
*05:07.280- 05:12.840* :  Ukraine after doubts emerged over that continued US funding, as well as political support in parts
*05:12.840- 05:18.460* :  of Europe. 24 hours later, NATO has been warning that Western countries are running out of
*05:18.460- 05:23.280* :  ammunition to give the Ukrainians in their fight against the Russian occupiers. Our diplomatic
*05:23.280- 05:29.240* :  correspondent James Landel reports from Poland. Every day, Ukraine fires thousands of rounds of
*05:29.240- 05:35.380* :  artillery shells in defense of its territory. Most of them come from stockpiles belonging to NATO
*05:35.380- 05:40.980* :  members. The Western Allies, it appears, are struggling to replenish their stocks. Admiral Rob
*05:41.020- 05:47.380* :  NATO's most senior military official told the Warsaw Security Forum there simply hadn't been
*05:47.380- 05:53.260* :  enough investment. The bottom of the barrel is now visible. And we need the industry to ramp up
*05:53.260- 06:00.200* :  production in a much higher tempo. And we need large volumes. Sweden's Defence Minister, Paul
*06:00.200- 06:05.700* :  Johnson, said Europe was digging pretty deep into its stocks. Britain's armed forces minister,
*06:05.700- 06:12.960* :  James Hepe, said ammunition supplies were looking a bit thin. An urge NATO allies to spend 2% of
*06:12.960- 06:18.540* :  their national wealth on defence, as they've committed to do. Western powers have, in recent months,
*06:18.540- 06:24.380* :  agreed plans to boost arms production by sharing expertise and agreeing joint contracts.
*06:25.120- 06:30.740* :  But progress, it seems, is slow. This could have a real impact on the bloody battlefields of southern
*06:30.740- 06:40.360* :  Ukraine. James Landel in Warsaw. Italy was hit by tragedy on Tuesday night after 21 people died when
*06:40.360- 06:52.480* :  a coach crashed off a motorway bridge on the outskirts of Venice. Another 40 people were injured
*06:52.480- 06:58.160* :  in the incident. Tom Kington, Italy correspondent for the Times newspaper, told me the latest.
*06:58.820- 07:04.600* :  It seems that the bus was traveling back from Venice to a campsite on the mainland across the
*07:04.600- 07:10.260* :  bridge that crosses the lagoon from Venice. Early reports suggest that they may have been tourists,
*07:10.340- 07:18.280* :  perhaps some Ukrainians and Germans. The bus careered off the fly over dropped around 15 meters
*07:18.280- 07:25.400* :  to the ground. Some reports say it hit power lines. Others would say that the flames that engulfed
*07:25.400- 07:32.180* :  the bus were provoked by the fact that it was a methane-powered bus. A lot of uncertainty right now.
*07:32.180- 07:39.340* :  What seems to be sure is so far 21 victims, numerous injured and amongst those victims, two children.
*07:39.500- 07:44.640* :  Looking at the pictures from the scene, the bus, after having driven off that fly over and then
*07:44.640- 07:49.980* :  crashing down, it's amazing that anyone survived. Actually, I've seen this happen before. There was
*07:49.980- 07:56.300* :  similar crash near Naples a few years ago, which I covered when a bus dropped from a great height
*07:56.300- 08:02.140* :  and miraculously some people survived. And do we have any idea what led the bus to go off
*08:02.180- 08:07.440* :  course and hit the railing? None whatsoever could have been a driver error, perhaps a mechanical
*08:07.440- 08:13.700* :  fault in the bus, but I guess details will emerge slowly in days to come. And should it be the case
*08:13.700- 08:20.100* :  that those kind of railings support any vehicle and stop them going through it? You would imagine
*08:20.100- 08:25.120* :  that that's their purpose. That's what they're meant to do. Going back to the accident near Naples
*08:25.120- 08:31.040* :  a few years ago, it turned out that the barrier just wasn't strong enough when taking a direct hit
*08:31.580- 08:37.620* :  from a bus traveling fast. Now, this happened quite late at night, but I imagine that part of Italy,
*08:37.620- 08:41.860* :  in fact, the whole country must be in shock. Absolutely, yes. As the mayor of Venice said,
*08:41.860- 08:48.380* :  with an apocalyptic scene, I have no words. Likewise, immediate message from Prime Minister
*08:48.380- 08:54.280* :  Georgi Malone expressing her condolences as the whole nation tunes in to find out what happened.
*08:54.860- 09:01.500* :  Tom Kington, Rome correspondent of Times newspaper. Following years of war in their homeland,
*09:01.500- 09:06.620* :  more than four million Afghans currently live in neighboring Pakistan, with hundreds of
*09:06.620- 09:12.100* :  thousands arriving since the Taliban regained power in Kabul. The Pakistani interior minister says
*09:12.100- 09:18.460* :  1.7 million Afghans are in Pakistan illegally, and they've now been given a deadline of November
*09:18.460- 09:24.380* :  the 1st to leave voluntarily or face being deported. Government sources told the state-run news
*09:24.380- 09:29.360* :  agency they eventually wanted all Afghans to leave. The announcement follows an upsurge in
*09:29.360- 09:34.240* :  militant attacks along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. I heard more about those tensions
*09:34.240- 09:39.200* :  from our South Asia regional editor and Barassan Etirajan. There has been a number of
*09:39.280- 09:44.620* :  bomb attacks in Pakistan in the last 10 months or so, especially after the Pakistani
*09:44.620- 09:50.600* :  Taliban militant group called off a ceasefire with Pakistani security forces late last year.
*09:50.600- 09:55.880* :  That led to an upsurge in violence, particularly targeting Pakistani security forces,
*09:55.880- 10:01.760* :  and a number of civilians have also been killed in various bomb blasts, the latest being a suicide
*10:01.760- 10:06.920* :  attack in Balochistan province that killed more than 50 people. Now, the Pakistani government
*10:06.920- 10:11.620* :  is under pressure to take action, and according to the Pakistani interior minister,
*10:11.620- 10:18.320* :  Sirfras Bhukti, what they say is they have placed nearly 14 out of these 24 attacks to Afghan
*10:18.320- 10:24.180* :  nationals. That is what led to this extraordinary announcement of planning to send all the illegal
*10:24.180- 10:29.400* :  immigrants, most of them Afghan refugees, back to their country, and that is going to increase
*10:29.400- 10:34.400* :  tensions between the countries. Yeah, I mean, is this policy even feasible to carry out?
*10:34.580- 10:38.660* :  If you talk to any Pakistani analyst, they would say that as and when the Pakistan
*10:38.660- 10:42.680* :  comes under pressure, they would announce this policy of expelling illegal immigrants,
*10:43.040- 10:47.160* :  particularly referring to Afghan nationals, they had announced it in the past, but they found
*10:47.160- 10:52.460* :  it very difficult to identify people and then deport them. Basically, many of these Afghan
*10:52.460- 10:57.380* :  nationals who migrated to Pakistan, they had obtained Pakistani citizenship, so it is difficult
*10:57.380- 11:01.920* :  to identify who is Afghan and who is Pakistan, and people have been living in communities,
*11:01.920- 11:06.860* :  for example, in Karachi or in Balochistan province or in the tribal districts of North
*11:06.860- 11:12.240* :  Western part of Pakistan. So it is difficult for the government to carry out this particular
*11:12.240- 11:18.220* :  raid, so it is going to be a major issue for Pakistan itself and how feasible it is.
*11:18.620- 11:23.420* :  Many people would think that it is a diversionary tactic by the Pakistan government because they
*11:23.420- 11:28.920* :  are struggling to control the number of violent incidents, and Pakistan also accuses Afghan
*11:29.020- 11:34.920* :  of providing sanctuary to these Pakistani Taliban militants, acclaimed inite by Kabul.
*11:35.600- 11:41.800* :  Or South Asia, regional editor, and Barassan Etirajan. How much do the past actions of Britain
*11:41.800- 11:47.160* :  and France still shape events in the Middle East today? That's a question being explored
*11:47.160- 11:52.960* :  in a new BBC series, The Mandate, charting the course of British and French colonial rule
*11:53.360- 11:57.880* :  after the end of the First World War, when they were given powers to govern by the League of
*11:57.880- 12:02.540* :  Nations. One historian said the events of that time were so influential, they effectively
*12:02.540- 12:07.280* :  amounted to a history of the present. The series is presented by Tom Bateman.
*12:09.320- 12:13.480* :  We're in the middle of a roundabout, and it's a statue gleaming in the sunshine.
*12:14.240- 12:19.760* :  It depicts very dramatically loss and resistance. There's a bereaved woman cradling her dying
*12:19.820- 12:32.380* :  husband or son. I chose to keep my principles, my words, I was punished, I was someone for interrogation,
*12:33.120- 12:38.960* :  many, many times. This is Naila Alatrash, a well-known Syrian actor and theater director.
*12:39.620- 12:45.880* :  She fled her country after 2011 for speaking out against the regime, and commemorated on
*12:45.880- 12:53.260* :  the roundabout is her grandfather, Sultan Alatrash, who was sentry earlier for the French in Syria.
*12:53.260- 13:02.700* :  An inspiration to her generation says Naila. I grew up listening to the heroic stories of great
*13:02.700- 13:12.160* :  Syrian revolution. How those young men stood in the face of the French Mandate of Syria?
*13:12.620- 13:17.360* :  Naila is one of the descendants of many who lived during that period, who have revealed the
*13:17.360- 13:24.020* :  impact of an earlier generational struggle and how the impact of what took place then still reverberates.
*13:29.920- 13:34.740* :  Palestine was to undergo a series of convulsions which hit the turning point midway
*13:34.740- 13:40.240* :  through the British Mandate there. In the First World War Britain had promised a Jewish home.
*13:40.240- 13:47.820* :  By the 1930s it was trying to contain an Arab uprising. Its response to the Arab revolt was brutal.
*13:48.340- 13:54.000* :  If British soldiers came under attack, its forces carried out collective punishment against entire
*13:54.000- 14:00.000* :  villages. I've come to the very northern edge, what is now northern Israel right on the border
*14:00.560- 14:07.580* :  with Lebanon, and this was the site of one of those attacks by the British. It was a reprisal
*14:07.880- 14:13.940* :  by British soldiers after four had been killed in a roadside bombing by Arab rebels.
*14:13.940- 14:19.060* :  The local commander had said the nearest village, regardless of any evidence of who was to blame,
*14:19.060- 14:24.820* :  would be punished. And that's exactly what they did here in what was the Palestinian village of
*14:25.180- 14:30.940* :  Al-Basser. Among the people that lived here and remembered that event in great detail were the
*14:30.940- 14:38.940* :  parents of Eid Hadad. They saw the troops coming in and they attacked people and my father told me
*14:38.940- 14:45.540* :  one of the men who was hit on his head with Mudakal is something it looks like a wooden hammer which
*14:45.540- 14:52.660* :  we used to mince the meat with. So he died. A man and his son were hanging tobacco leaves to
*14:52.660- 14:58.220* :  dry them. They were just shot in the back and they died. The UK government has never acknowledged
*14:58.220- 15:03.960* :  the British atrocity in the village of Al-Basser. For decades after the mandates, the Middle East
*15:03.960- 15:11.000* :  was plunged into wars and sectarian upheaval. Its causes are complex, but the changes left by
*15:11.000- 15:17.240* :  the European powers across different parts of this region were foundational, a legacy that still
*15:17.240- 15:20.980* :  resonates today. A Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman
*15:23.840- 15:29.060* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast why Kenya is leading the newly approved multinational
*15:29.060- 15:36.700* :  force for Haiti. African feasts, hunger, drought, flooding and nations in Europe and Asia in
*15:36.700- 15:41.400* :  the Americans have always come to our health. So it is also time for us to help other people.
*15:50.280- 15:55.820* :  Back now to the US and a tale of two court cases. We'll have the latest from Donald Trump's
*15:55.820- 16:01.680* :  battle to hold onto his businesses in New York in a moment. But first to Delaware where Hunter Biden,
*16:01.680- 16:07.500* :  son of President Biden, pleaded not guilty to lying about his drug use while buying a handgun.
*16:07.500- 16:12.720* :  He was charged last month with three counts related to lying on a federal form in 2018
*16:12.720- 16:18.200* :  after a plea deal fell apart. Our correspondent Gary O'Donney who has the latest from Delaware.
*16:18.640- 16:24.340* :  Hunter Biden spent about an hour in total inside and as we expected he pleaded not guilty
*16:24.340- 16:30.360* :  to these three firearms charges. There are going to be some motions brought in this case.
*16:30.520- 16:34.920* :  For example, his defence are going to bring a motion to dismiss on the basis that there
*16:34.920- 16:39.140* :  was a plea agreement in place at least until July and they believe that is still valid.
*16:39.540- 16:44.360* :  And they also believe that the charges are unconstitutional given the nature of some recent
*16:44.360- 16:49.960* :  Supreme Court judgments on gun ownership. They have until the beginning of November to do that.
*16:49.960- 16:54.940* :  We don't have a trial date. Of course, a trial date will depend on the outcome of those motions
*16:54.940- 17:00.340* :  but he seemed pretty relaxed in court talking to his lawyers wearing a dark suit and
*17:00.340- 17:05.400* :  giving a little wave to journalists as he left. Gary O'Donney who in Delaware, a couple of
*17:05.400- 17:11.280* :  hundred kilometres north in Manhattan, Donald Trump's civil fraud case, was into its second day.
*17:11.280- 17:16.620* :  New York prosecutors claim the former president deceived banks, insurers and others by
*17:16.620- 17:23.360* :  overvaluing his assets. Mr Trump isn't required to attend in person but did so for the second day
*17:23.360- 17:28.880* :  and once again lashed out at New York Attorney General Attisha James. Our North America correspondent
*17:28.880- 17:34.940* :  Nettaal Feeck was out in the court. Really is now down to business. So it is the first witness,
*17:34.940- 17:41.800* :  same one who began yesterday, Donald Bender, who's an accountant with Masars, who basically compiled
*17:41.800- 17:48.200* :  the financial statements for the Trump Organization for several years. And we are now just hearing
*17:48.200- 17:53.500* :  where he is going through the fact that it was the Trump Organization that was responsible for the
*17:53.500- 17:58.060* :  dip for their accounting principles used in the records, the disclosures and the report. He was
*17:58.060- 18:03.560* :  asked numerous times now if he knew the information provided was false if he would have prepared the
*18:03.560- 18:08.900* :  reports and he has said no. There was some speculation over whether Mr. Trump would testify in
*18:08.900- 18:13.840* :  person but he has said he will take the stand. That's right. I was actually in court and during
*18:13.840- 18:18.560* :  one of the breaks when Mr. Trump was walking back into the courtroom I shouted a question asking
*18:18.560- 18:23.740* :  if he will testify. He says that he will be testifying when he is called to the stand.
*18:23.740- 18:29.440* :  He still has time to change his mind and legal experts that I've spoken to have said that that
*18:29.440- 18:34.880* :  would be a risky strategy for him and any false statement could lead to perjury charges.
*18:35.360- 18:40.860* :  He knows what is at stake in this case. It is the future of his real estate empire and so
*18:40.860- 18:45.780* :  him appearing here in court. I think it does show just how much he is taking this seriously.
*18:45.780- 18:51.320* :  Nettaal Feeck in New York returning now to a story we brought you on the podcast this time
*18:51.320- 18:56.040* :  yesterday. The UN Security Council decision to approve a multinational force to Haiti
*18:56.040- 19:00.200* :  to tackle gang violence there that's brought the Caribbean nation to its knees.
*19:00.800- 19:05.640* :  After pleading for help for at least a year the Haitian Prime Minister welcomed the UN
*19:05.640- 19:11.820* :  announcement saying the bell of liberation has sounded. The new mission is being led by Kenya.
*19:11.820- 19:18.460* :  It's foreign minister Alfred Matua told James Menendez why they decided to take on the role.
*19:18.860- 19:23.440* :  One the people of Haiti deserve better and we know what they have gone through over the years
*19:23.440- 19:28.740* :  with the earthquake in the hurricanes with the assassination of the president the breakdown
*19:28.740- 19:36.800* :  of political systems. Number two Africans have faced hunger, drought, flooding and nations
*19:36.800- 19:43.380* :  in Europe and Asia in the Americas have always come to our help and so it is also time for us
*19:43.380- 19:48.780* :  to help other people especially the ones that are in need. Number three is because we have a very
*19:48.780- 19:54.480* :  good history of working on peacekeeping missions and some of these enforcement missions in Namibia,
*19:54.700- 20:00.520* :  East Timor. We just felt compelled to do something about our brothers and sisters because the
*20:00.520- 20:04.700* :  world could not just sit and just watch as Haitians were just being finished.
*20:05.200- 20:08.940* :  But what sort of police officers will go to Haiti and what will they be doing?
*20:09.360- 20:14.140* :  Basically in four slow and order period they need to open access ways that have been blocked by
*20:14.140- 20:20.000* :  the gangs, disarm the gangs, protect establishments such as the port, the airport and others allow
*20:20.000- 20:24.700* :  free movement of people and goods. They need to be in a place so that hospitals can reopen,
*20:24.780- 20:31.840* :  schools can reopen and a semblance of life can be established. But we are not just going there
*20:31.840- 20:37.600* :  to fight the gangs. We are looking at serious engagement also in terms of encouraging
*20:37.600- 20:42.740* :  our political solution. We are doing it so that Haitians can also rebuild their own country.
*20:43.020- 20:47.400* :  And this also includes training. Training is very important because we can't stay there forever.
*20:47.400- 20:53.360* :  In previous missions to Haiti, the numbers were much larger in the first case, more than 20,000.
*20:53.360- 20:57.540* :  Brazil sent about 13,000. So I just wonder whether a thousand is going to be enough.
*20:58.100- 21:01.500* :  That is just the initial installment in terms of what Kenya is offering.
*21:01.820- 21:06.480* :  This is not just a Kenyan mission. Kenya is just leading the team and we hope that this is the
*21:06.480- 21:10.240* :  last time there will be an operation to Haiti. The people of Haiti are tired. They have had
*21:10.300- 21:15.540* :  borne the brunt of it and want to do it properly effectively and fast and be able to leave them with
*21:15.540- 21:20.300* :  a stable government, leave them with a stable country. People are tired of gangs. We are going
*21:20.300- 21:24.800* :  into an environment where people are hungry for change and people are waiting for us to go
*21:25.060- 21:30.520* :  and back them up in their struggle against the lawlessness that is in the country and empower
*21:30.520- 21:35.500* :  brothers and sisters of the Caribbean who are part of the Afghan Union, diaspora and then leave
*21:35.660- 21:40.340* :  them as they continue. Kenya's Foreign Minister Alfred Moutou are talking to James Menendez.
*21:41.120- 21:45.980* :  The Nobel Prize for Physics has been awarded to three scientists for their research into generating
*21:45.980- 21:52.960* :  extremely short pulses of light. It is hoped the work by Pierre Agostini, Verenche Crouchan,
*21:52.960- 21:59.740* :  and Luillier will help advance medical diagnostics and electronics. And Luillier is only the fifth
*21:59.740- 22:03.120* :  woman to have won the prize. Here's our science correspondent Palab Gouch.
*22:03.920- 22:09.880* :  Electrons move incredibly fast. They can change position in billions of a billionth of a second.
*22:10.660- 22:17.120* :  For decades, these tiny speedsters have been hard to pin down, under even the very best microscopes.
*22:17.640- 22:22.360* :  But between them, these three scientists have created instruments that have in effect
*22:22.360- 22:28.900* :  ultra-high shutter speeds. Just as a sports photographer can capture an image of a football hurtling
*22:28.900- 22:34.540* :  into a net, the researchers have developed what's called atosecond physics to bring the behavior
*22:34.540- 22:41.580* :  electrons into sharper focus. But even then, they don't exist at a fixed point, according to
*22:41.580- 22:46.560* :  Professor Anne-Lierre, who's one of the winners. The electrons are much more like water waves,
*22:46.560- 22:52.640* :  starting particles. And what we try to measure is the position of the crest of the waves.
*22:52.900- 22:58.940* :  And what we try to get information on is what is the time it takes for electron to move,
*22:58.940- 23:04.680* :  for example, to go away. Professor Lierre explained that she initially ignored the call from
*23:04.680- 23:08.920* :  the Nobel Committee to inform her of her award, because she was teaching students.
*23:09.820- 23:13.940* :  She relented on the third or fourth attempt, and after a brief conversation,
*23:13.940- 23:18.740* :  she continued with her lecture, though she admitted to being a little distracted during the
*23:18.740- 23:23.040* :  remainder of her talk. Professor Lierre's work, along with her fellow winners,
*23:23.500- 23:29.040* :  is likely to lead to even more accurate electron microscopes, much faster electronics,
*23:29.680- 23:34.380* :  and new tests that are able to diagnose diseases at a much earlier stage.
*23:34.860- 23:39.600* :  Palab gauche. The James Webb telescope appears to be the gift that keeps on giving.
*23:39.600- 23:43.000* :  The latest discovery from its advantage point orbiting the Sun
*23:43.000- 23:47.720* :  Art Jupiter-sized planets floating in space, unconnected to any star.
*23:48.280- 23:52.320* :  Professor Richard Ellis from University College London was part of the committee that proposed
*23:52.320- 23:58.540* :  the James Webb telescope in the mid-1990s. He told Michelle Hussain more about the new finding.
*23:59.440- 24:03.780* :  Well, they are planets, probably. It's been known for quite a while that there are what we
*24:03.780- 24:08.940* :  call free-floating planets. In stellar nurseries where stars are very close to each other,
*24:09.440- 24:15.180* :  one planet can be perturbed by the adjacent star, and occasionally these planets, which are
*24:15.180- 24:19.800* :  normally found orbiting stars, get shot out of that particular solar system.
*24:19.920- 24:24.900* :  What's puzzling about the recent discovery is they seem to be shot out in pairs. This is a new
*24:24.900- 24:30.660* :  twist to the story. If you think about shooting two things out at once, you'd imagine as they
*24:30.660- 24:34.960* :  go further away from where they started. They would diverge, but for some reason they keep
*24:35.020- 24:39.700* :  together in pairs. So there must be some sort of viscous drag or something that's
*24:39.700- 24:42.240* :  keeping them together. Are they within our solar system?
*24:42.440- 24:48.700* :  No, these are around stars and regions where stars are forming. So it's a very dense star cluster
*24:48.700- 24:54.520* :  where baby stars are being born, and these planets are found in between the stars. So it wouldn't
*24:54.520- 24:59.100* :  form there normally. They must have formed in a particular solar system and then been shot out
*24:59.520- 25:04.580* :  by the perturbation of nearby stars. It's just one example every week of what this amazing
*25:04.580- 25:07.120* :  telescope is throwing up. It's just fantastic.
*25:07.180- 25:12.940* :  Does it exceed your expectations and hopes when you're involved in the first phase of developing it?
*25:12.980- 25:19.400* :  Well, I think our committee, which was primarily a US committee, was quite visionary if I could say so.
*25:19.580- 25:25.020* :  We formulated a plan for an infrared telescope, a telescope that's rather different from Hubble,
*25:25.020- 25:29.300* :  space telescope, which people are probably familiar with, which is an optical telescope.
*25:29.940- 25:34.700* :  And we thought there would be two science pillars that would make the case for this telescope.
*25:34.700- 25:40.700* :  One is to look back in time far enough to see the moment when the universe was first bathed
*25:40.700- 25:45.160* :  in starlight, which is the work that I do. Euphemistically we call it cosmic dawn.
*25:45.760- 25:50.860* :  And the other would be to examine the planets around other stars, particularly their atmospheres,
*25:51.020- 25:56.640* :  to see if they contain evidence of conditions that are conducive to life. So what two bigger
*25:56.960- 26:01.820* :  questions? The birth of starlight, which is where we come from, and looking for evidence of
*26:01.820- 26:06.140* :  life elsewhere in the universe. Professor Richard Ellis talking to Michelle has seen.
*26:06.840- 26:11.160* :  More than 12,000 athletes are taking part in the Asian Games in China.
*26:11.580- 26:17.240* :  But one event, the women's 100 metres hurdles, has fallen foul of Chinese Communist Party
*26:17.240- 26:23.340* :  sensors because of an unintended reference to the Chanaman Square massacre during an embrace by
*26:23.340- 26:27.960* :  two Chinese sprinters, as I heard from our China media analyst, Kerry Allen.
*26:28.320- 26:31.660* :  One of them was wearing it at number six, and the other was wearing a number four.
*26:31.920- 26:34.540* :  And the way they were hugging, you could see these numbers next to each other.
*26:34.700- 26:42.320* :  Now, any mention of six and four next to each other in China, generally it is censored because six
*26:42.320- 26:48.720* :  and four represents in some Chinese circles the 4th of June, which is the anniversary of the
*26:48.720- 26:54.340* :  Tiananmen Square protest in 1989. So it's been a huge target of China's online sensors.
*26:54.560- 26:59.960* :  And how does the censorship work? Well generally, it involves manual sensors. So we're talking
*26:59.960- 27:04.860* :  thousands of people who are literally just watching day in, day out for sensitive content
*27:04.860- 27:10.960* :  and manually removing stuff. And also when it comes to Tiananmen, there is especially heavy censorship
*27:10.960- 27:18.020* :  on the anniversary, to the extent where even little emojis representing an anniversary,
*27:18.020- 27:23.860* :  like a cake represents a birthday. These are removed from social media platforms. And on the 4th
*27:23.860- 27:29.180* :  of June every year, I see any mention of 64 being removed from social media.
*27:29.420- 27:34.740* :  Is there any way of getting around that process? Yes, absolutely. I've seen people who've been
*27:34.740- 27:39.640* :  putting this picture on a platform called Weibo, which is China's equivalent of a social media
*27:39.640- 27:45.500* :  platform like Facebook. And what they've been doing is recognizing that if people are replicating
*27:45.520- 27:49.740* :  this sensitive image, what they're doing is they're slightly photoshopping the image,
*27:49.740- 27:54.540* :  making it harder for it to be automatically removed. Or they're sharing images that are blurry,
*27:54.540- 28:00.000* :  they're trying to mention online posts that don't directly mention the athletes, because they're
*28:00.000- 28:06.000* :  conscious that there will be people who are literally sitting down looking for Lin Yu Wei and Wu Yan Yi.
*28:06.060- 28:11.760* :  It's a very dedicated effort every year for people in China to try and get the message about Tiananmen
*28:11.760- 28:15.960* :  out, because China has actively denied that the Tiananmen protests ever happened.
*28:16.600- 28:21.100* :  But even big celebrities like Taylor Swift have fallen foul of the censors.
*28:21.400- 28:25.060* :  They have, yes, because when Taylor Swift released her 1989 album,
*28:25.060- 28:31.280* :  1989 being the year that the Tiananmen Square protests happened, also her initials TNS were on
*28:31.280- 28:36.500* :  the album covers and merchandise as well. So in the past, content like that has been removed from
*28:36.500- 28:37.800* :  Chinese social media platforms.
*28:37.800- 28:43.100* :  Our China media analyst, Carrie Allen. Nigeria is a wash with musical talent,
*28:43.100- 28:47.440* :  but one singer who's really managed to break through in the last couple of years is Benson.
*28:47.440- 28:52.880* :  He's had a string of hits with Afrobeat stars, including WizKid and Burnaboy, as well as
*28:52.880- 28:59.400* :  British artist Dave and Stefan Don. He's even made it onto former President Barack Obama's annual
*28:59.400- 29:06.200* :  playlist. On Thursday, Benson is releasing his debut album, Sincerely Benson. He spoke to DJ Edu,
*29:06.540- 29:09.020* :  presenter of the BBC's Music Program. This is Africa.
*29:09.700- 29:13.740* :  It sounds like a letter. It's more than what I'm calling it Sincerely Benson.
*29:14.120- 29:17.880* :  It sounds like an envelope of emotions that I'm ready to just give out.
*29:25.760- 29:30.280* :  The title struck me because you actually spelt Benson properly this time.
*29:30.280- 29:35.240* :  I wanted to be able to spell it out or see it for what the name is really.
*29:35.580- 29:38.100* :  And what was the reason for that? Because obviously I knew you were
*29:38.100- 29:40.740* :  would you before and then you switched it.
*29:40.800- 29:46.440* :  My own name was actually Daniel Benson. And would you is native Jamaican for bread fruit?
*29:46.460- 29:51.980* :  It's like a nickname given to like choppy kids. I personalized it into something that meant
*29:52.060- 29:58.700* :  more to me than just bread fruit. But then along the line, I wanted more authenticity.
*29:58.780- 30:03.600* :  I wanted things that were more original to me, especially knowing that it's Budubar Anton
*30:03.600- 30:07.800* :  and there's a hundred other budges in Jamaica. That's because the choppy,
*30:08.340- 30:10.760* :  you know, so that was the reason why the name changed.
*30:11.180- 30:15.680* :  And I needed to make it prominent on the album because I had a conversation with Berna
*30:16.060- 30:19.580* :  at the period where I just changed the name. And he was asking me like,
*30:20.380- 30:23.500* :  do you remember that time we were talking about changing your name before
*30:23.500- 30:28.740* :  and we didn't agree? The next project that you're doing, I need you to make emphasis on that name.
*30:29.220- 30:31.620* :  And has the new name stuck how people are taking that on?
*30:32.500- 30:36.780* :  Yeah, man. I mean, people call me Benson. People call me Budubar Anton.
*30:36.920- 30:42.100* :  I can't blame people for taking it the way they love it or how they find it best to pronounce it.
*30:42.520- 30:44.480* :  Trust me, we already know who you're talking about.
*30:53.260- 30:56.920* :  And he spoke about Berna there. How was it you working with him? How was the whole
*30:56.920- 31:02.320* :  synergy? Super amazing. As I went to Berna for like a year, we were working on a whole lot of
*31:02.560- 31:07.480* :  other stuff. He's an amazing person and I love him on a mentorship level.
*31:08.060- 31:11.000* :  Still more work is going to come but I can't be spilling all that out.
*31:12.700- 31:15.380* :  Come on, give us the exclusive one. Come on, bro.
*31:29.240- 31:35.760* :  And obviously, we've known you for adding that sweet voice to a lot of collaborations.
*31:36.840- 31:40.540* :  Is that what we're expecting on the album as well or do we get to experience more of Budub?
*31:41.240- 31:45.480* :  Yeah, there are a couple of collaborations on the album. I wanted them to be really specific and
*31:46.340- 31:52.460* :  precise to what the message I was trying to pass across really, you know. Like, no, I have
*31:52.460- 31:58.320* :  had one on the project. That is had one's best verse internationally.
*31:59.580- 32:04.800* :  When it drops, you can take it to the bank. They'll give you $100,000. I'm not playing with you.
*32:04.800- 32:11.640* :  If I was a betting man. Everybody that's on this project came in with
*32:12.060- 32:17.480* :  that idiom, no even that idiom that is I do. I'm super excited about it.
*32:21.620- 32:23.560* :  Benson talking to DJ Edu.
*32:26.540- 32:30.860* :  And that is all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast very soon.
*32:30.860- 32:35.440* :  This one was mixed by Martin Baker and produced by Emma Joseph, our editors Karen Martin.
*32:35.440- 32:38.020* :  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
