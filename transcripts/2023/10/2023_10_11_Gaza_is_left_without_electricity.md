*00:44.160- 00:49.520* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday 11th of October.
*00:49.520- 00:56.460* :  Garza's electricity goes off as the only power plant runs out of fuel. Israel continues its bombardment
*00:56.460- 01:01.220* :  of the Palestinian territory and masses troops following the Hamas attacks at the weekend.
*01:02.000- 01:06.620* :  In other news, Western Afghanistan's been hit by another strong earthquake the second in days.
*01:09.540- 01:14.940* :  Also in the podcast, NATO says it will take strong action if investigators find a gas pipeline
*01:14.940- 01:21.980* :  in the Baltic was sabotaged. And their designer, flat leather sandals, have had many nicknames
*01:21.980- 01:27.100* :  over the years, but they've also managed to raise the hype around the brand with these partnerships.
*01:27.800- 01:32.040* :  The once uncool German Birkenstock brand that is now worth billions.
*01:37.060- 01:42.180* :  Just before we began recording this podcast, we got news from Garza that means electricity had gone
*01:42.180- 01:47.800* :  out there after the only power station in the Palestinian territory ran out of fuel. Israel has
*01:47.800- 01:52.760* :  cut off electricity, fuel, water and food following the Hamas assault at the weekend.
*01:52.780- 01:59.040* :  Air strikes have continued with 1555 people dead according to Palestinian officials.
*01:59.740- 02:02.880* :  Doctors have warned that hospitals could soon run out of supplies.
*02:02.880- 02:08.400* :  Professor Hassan Abu Sita is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon usually based in London.
*02:08.400- 02:13.400* :  He's been working in Garza's main hospital over the past few days and he spoke to Martha Kani.
*02:14.000- 02:18.740* :  The hospital grounds have turned into a refugee camp. People are afraid and so they're bringing
*02:18.740- 02:25.080* :  their families to stay in the compound of the hospital as a safe space and there's just a continuous
*02:25.080- 02:30.820* :  stream of wounded. The hospital is at capacity beds and most of the other hospitals already in
*02:30.820- 02:39.940* :  Garza are at capacity. Garza has around 2,200 to 2,500 beds and we've already had 4,500 wounded.
*02:40.400- 02:42.360* :  What kind of casualties have you been saying?
*02:42.960- 02:50.980* :  So it's glass injuries, trappinal injuries, masonry, fallen masonry, burns and as is the case
*02:50.980- 02:56.120* :  with all the wars in Garza, there's such a high percentage of children that are wounded. I'm just
*02:56.120- 03:01.160* :  about to go into the operating room with a what looks like a seven or eight-year-old child
*03:01.180- 03:11.240* :  with severe facial injuries. We have children with major burns. We have a teenager with 70 percent
*03:11.240- 03:18.600* :  total body burns and usually around the third to 40 percent of the wounded in Garza's wars are
*03:18.640- 03:24.940* :  children. How are you managing to work as a doctor? We know the issues around supplies, around
*03:24.940- 03:31.120* :  electricity, around water. So the supplies are already running short because of the siege. I mean,
*03:31.120- 03:40.180* :  this is 15 years of siege and you feel it. You ask for basic medication and they're either very
*03:40.180- 03:46.640* :  short or they're completely run out. And with regards to the electricity, the generators are on
*03:46.640- 03:54.360* :  to at least keep the operating rooms running. But if this lasts for longer than the next few days,
*03:54.360- 04:00.100* :  that the health system's already on its knees and is unable to cope and unless there's a humanitarian
*04:00.100- 04:04.640* :  corridor to resupply the health system in Garza, the health system's going to collapse.
*04:05.240- 04:10.100* :  Professor Hassan Abu Sita and for the latest from Garza we heard from our reporter there,
*04:10.100- 04:14.920* :  Ruchdi Abu Alouf. The shilling from tanks along the border to the Wistran
*04:14.920- 04:21.300* :  part of Gaza wasn't intensified in the last half an hour or so. Also, we understand that Israeli
*04:21.300- 04:29.140* :  navy was engaged in firing into the seaport, the only harbour in Gaza, destroying most part of
*04:29.180- 04:37.020* :  this harbour. The non-stop shilling since last night started around 8 o'clock in the evening
*04:37.020- 04:43.500* :  last night with focusing the air strikes in an neighborhood called Al-Karama in the north of Gaza,
*04:43.500- 04:49.620* :  it's north west of Gaza where most of the damage overnight happened and where 30 people were killed.
*04:50.200- 04:56.980* :  The overall distance now is 1555 people and the number might be increased according to
*04:56.980- 05:02.060* :  the health ministry because there are many people who are in a very difficult, very severe injuries
*05:02.580- 05:07.680* :  in the area. The health ministry just issued a statement saying that they will stop all of
*05:07.680- 05:14.480* :  essential medical treatment and they will focus only on the life-saving treatment because they
*05:14.480- 05:21.780* :  believe by doing this they can extend as much as possible the amount of fuel and the amount of
*05:21.780- 05:28.020* :  medical staff, medical needs to help those people. Talking about the humanitarian situation,
*05:28.020- 05:35.000* :  we are entering the fifth day of this war and nothing is coming into Gaza, none from Egypt,
*05:35.000- 05:41.820* :  none from Israel, the electricity supplies was cut off, internet supplies, also was cut off,
*05:41.820- 05:48.760* :  and water supplies. Rusty Abu Aluf in Gaza. The total number of Israelis and foreign
*05:48.760- 05:55.740* :  nationals killed in southern Israel has now reached 1,200. A sites of massacres are searched.
*05:56.360- 06:01.240* :  Troops are massing near Gaza ahead of a possible invasion. The Israeli defence minister,
*06:01.240- 06:05.760* :  Yohav Galant, told soldiers the next phase of their offensive would come from the ground.
*06:05.760- 06:11.400* :  He said, Hamas wanted a change and it will get one. What was in Gaza will no longer be.
*06:11.400- 06:16.240* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Bowen, interviewed Israeli Major General Itaverouv,
*06:16.500- 06:21.180* :  a commander of forces near the border. He asked him about the risk to Palestinian civilians.
*06:52.920- 06:55.560* :  He said, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza,
*07:01.340- 07:04.000* :  we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza,
*07:04.360- 07:08.300* :  we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza,
*07:09.340- 07:13.140* :  we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza,
*07:25.520- 07:33.580* :  we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, we are in Gaza, you got up, we are coming from Gaza,
*07:33.580- 07:38.800* :  a lot of traffic, but it is a closed military zone. There's been a lot more military vehicles
*07:38.860- 07:45.460* :  racing by. There's more armor that's been massing in the fields around here. Some of it has
*07:45.460- 07:50.560* :  been moving closer to the border. Just in my line of eyesight, when I look at the junction,
*07:51.300- 07:56.960* :  where there's now only, there's there's flashing lights of police cars. There's Israeli flags,
*07:56.960- 08:01.320* :  the blue and white Israeli flags, but also there's Israeli military vehicles and soldiers. Yeah,
*08:01.320- 08:06.620* :  they're all coming out as a military center. Very close to here. All of this are the signs of
*08:06.620- 08:15.040* :  preparation by Israel. It's very hard to say when they believe that they have enough forces here,
*08:15.640- 08:22.560* :  enough armor, but also a plan. As we've been saying on the BBC that for decades, Israeli leaders,
*08:22.560- 08:28.560* :  including Benjamin Netanyahu have resisted this option. Going into Gaza, where Israeli troops
*08:28.560- 08:36.620* :  pulled out in 2005, not wanting to risk the lives of soldiers heading into a densely populated
*08:36.620- 08:45.660* :  enclave where Hamas is no doubt prepared for this kind of an Israeli assault. It's fraught with
*08:45.660- 08:51.040* :  risk, but given what has happened in the past several days, given the mood in Israel now,
*08:51.040- 08:56.360* :  it seems that that is really the only option that's on the table, but it's a dangerous one.
*08:56.980- 09:01.400* :  You know, the military saying that following that shock attack on the Saturday, they've now
*09:01.400- 09:06.820* :  reinforced all communities in the area. I mean, does it feel safer now?
*09:07.880- 09:13.240* :  Well, I think nobody feels safe now. Certainly not in Gaza, where we can see the plumes of black
*09:13.240- 09:19.960* :  smoke rising just beyond the tree line. There's better noon, which is one of the Gaza towns inside
*09:20.140- 09:27.360* :  the coastal strip, even where we are. There's a big green sign here pointing to Zikim, which
*09:27.360- 09:33.120* :  is an umbrella in the beach. People used to go to spend some leisure time in this kibbutz,
*09:33.380- 09:38.860* :  but there were some Hamas fighters, which were able to infiltrate that kibbutz yesterday. Even
*09:38.860- 09:44.980* :  yesterday, a day after Israel said it had regained control of the south, but it has to admit,
*09:44.980- 09:51.100* :  it cannot seal this border. It is very, very porous that Hamas is wanting to prove,
*09:51.100- 09:55.920* :  wants to be seen to prove that it can actually seal come through. Now, you're probably hearing
*09:55.920- 10:01.480* :  the traffic. White buses are going by. They're used to transport troops, and that's a black
*10:01.480- 10:06.400* :  bag military truck that's been bringing in supplies. Now, military vehicle lights flashing.
*10:06.400- 10:13.000* :  The side of the road is lined with vehicles next to military centers. Reserves who've been called up,
*10:13.380- 10:18.320* :  come to these areas, get out of their car, leave the car by the side of the road, pick up their
*10:18.320- 10:24.220* :  gun and come down here to be part of the, for now, clearing this southern area and getting ready
*10:24.220- 10:30.220* :  for the even bigger fight to come. Leased to set in southern Israel. Meanwhile, EU officials
*10:30.220- 10:35.660* :  have warned Elon Musk that his social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, is being used
*10:35.660- 10:42.180* :  to spread false information about the conflict. EU commissioner Terry Breton wrote to Mr. Musk to say
*10:42.180- 10:48.460* :  fake and manipulated images and facts were circulating on X. Mr. Musk said his firm had removed
*10:48.460- 10:54.460* :  certain accounts. Mike Wendling is our US disinformation reporter. Among plenty of legitimate
*10:54.460- 11:00.040* :  reporting online, there's been a huge wave of fake news. Recycled videos from past conflicts,
*11:00.040- 11:06.600* :  made up headlines, footage from video games, and graphic propaganda. X is not alone among social
*11:06.600- 11:12.160* :  networks and dealing with the deluge. But since taking over last year, Elon Musk dissolved an
*11:12.160- 11:17.620* :  independent trust and safety council at the company, and he slashed jobs at its safety team.
*11:18.240- 11:23.800* :  In a post on X, Elon Musk asked Mr. Breton to list the alleged illegal content and wrote,
*11:23.800- 11:29.520* :  our policy is that everything is open source and transparent. Twitter's safety team says it's
*11:29.520- 11:34.240* :  taken action on tens of thousands of more than 50 million posts about the conflict.
*11:34.240- 11:40.440* :  Mike Wendling and as we record this podcast, we're just getting some news from Southern Israel,
*11:40.440- 11:49.580* :  a hospital there in the southern city of Ashkelon says it has been hit by a rocket fired from Gaza.
*11:51.120- 11:57.380* :  Some other news now, and since the 1970s, the American musician Bernie Kraus has made over 5,000
*11:57.380- 12:03.080* :  hours of sound recordings of wildlife habitats around the world. The archive provides a way of
*12:03.080- 12:08.280* :  documenting shifts in endangered environments. He estimates that more than half of the habitats
*12:08.280- 12:13.540* :  have fallen silent because of human activity. Bernie Kraus spoke to Nicholas Sandridge about a
*12:13.540- 12:17.600* :  new collaboration bringing to life his archive from the Central African Republic.
*12:21.860- 12:27.760* :  Descending into darkness at 180 studios in London with sounds from the Sengar Sengar forest,
*12:28.400- 12:35.440* :  in the Central African Republic, captured by Louis Sano, produced by acoustic ecologist and author
*12:35.440- 12:42.200* :  of the Great Animal Orchestra, Bernie Kraus. We had Western lowland guerrilla, African gray
*12:42.200- 12:52.460* :  parrots, Hadada ibis, greater spotted monkey, and guinea terraco. All brought flickering to life
*12:52.460- 12:59.640* :  with hovering glowing lines of light, an installation designed by united visual artists Matt Clark.
*13:00.500- 13:07.840* :  On the floor is an array of small discrete speakers, and that's where the sounds of crickets,
*13:08.660- 13:16.240* :  frogs, birds call from, and then there's also an outer array of speakers where you get wind,
*13:16.360- 13:21.880* :  chainsaws in the distance, planes flying overhead, and really it's an interplay between
*13:22.800- 13:29.840* :  the man-made noises and forests. The structure is meant to represent a kind of monument to nature
*13:29.840- 13:39.240* :  which we can orchestrate like a sonic rewording. And as we hear the insects, you can see green lights
*13:39.300- 13:44.980* :  very soothing, very calming. As you hear the airplanes going over, they turn white, they become
*13:44.980- 13:50.080* :  quite bristle to the eye actually, to look at. And really it sort of demonstrates,
*13:51.180- 13:56.040* :  you know, we can live in harmony through the noise we make, but we can also disrupt nature.
*13:57.320- 14:05.480* :  Matt and his team have created an algorithm that allows you and the audience to see the sound
*14:05.480- 14:13.140* :  and its effect. Some of the recordings of the Bayerca tribe who actually sort of make a lot of
*14:13.140- 14:18.960* :  noise, music, but it's in harmony with the natural surroundings. We learned orchestration,
*14:19.600- 14:25.240* :  melody, rhythm, all of these things from the sounds of the natural world when we lived much
*14:25.240- 14:32.360* :  more closely. So it's really an epic story of, you know, how these habitats are devastated by
*14:33.100- 14:39.220* :  human endeavor. And the rainforest has been compromised because of extraction of hardwoods,
*14:39.400- 14:46.240* :  habitats that no longer exist. The animals have been poached, like the elephants, for instance,
*14:47.240- 14:50.780* :  that whole herd that I had in the original recording is gone now.
*14:52.560- 15:00.080* :  In Louis recordings, over time from 1984 to the time that he died, you can hear the sounds of
*15:00.080- 15:07.620* :  the rainforest diminish. Are you still traveling around and gathering sound? Yes, I am, and I'm 85
*15:07.620- 15:14.200* :  years old. That was out last night. And recording here in Sonoma, which is north of San Francisco,
*15:15.280- 15:23.800* :  the recordings of cricket sounds, night sounds, in an effort to record the entire year next comes
*15:23.840- 15:27.980* :  the frogs after the rains, then the birds come back in the springtime.
*15:38.060- 15:43.040* :  But everybody's in good fettle. There's no particular rush.
*15:44.580- 15:48.340* :  Head of the release of their new album, we hear from Rolling Stone Keith Richards.
*15:54.240- 15:58.860* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*15:59.140- 16:05.020* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed, like I'd never seen
*16:05.020- 16:08.960* :  anything like this. At the height of Abercrombie and Fitch's success.
*16:08.960- 16:14.820* :  This was me being carefully manipulated. Being lied to, tricked, and traded like a commodity.
*16:15.140- 16:20.840* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money, sex and power.
*16:21.820- 16:26.480* :  This is World of Secrets. Season one, The Abercrombie Guys.
*16:26.920- 16:30.300* :  Search for World of Secrets wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:32.220- 16:36.260* :  Afghanistan has been hit by a second powerful earthquake in a matter of days.
*16:36.260- 16:41.860* :  The new 6.3 magnitude tremor struck early on Wednesday morning near the city of Harat.
*16:42.320- 16:47.300* :  The extent of the damage isn't clear. Many people were already sleeping out in the open after
*16:47.300- 16:51.540* :  their homes were destroyed in Saturday's quake. I got the latest from Dauwood, Azami,
*16:51.540- 16:57.120* :  from the BBC Afghan service. The latest earthquake happened in the same region,
*16:57.860- 17:04.860* :  which was hit on Saturday five days ago. Since then, almost every day, people are saying that
*17:04.860- 17:12.320* :  there are aftershocks. Today's aftershock was relatively stronger. It happened early in the
*17:12.320- 17:20.900* :  morning when many people were sleeping. Since then, since Saturday, many people don't live in their
*17:20.900- 17:29.680* :  houses in their bedrooms. They sleep outside in tents in the cold because they were scared that
*17:29.680- 17:36.980* :  there might be another strong earthquake. For this reason, we expect that there will be less
*17:37.820- 17:45.760* :  casualties this time. But the earthquake and the aftershocks have killed around 2,000 people.
*17:45.760- 17:51.780* :  There are different figures because the authorities and agencies still don't have a clear picture
*17:51.780- 17:59.260* :  about the casualties. Definitely more than 1,000 Taliban government officials have been telling us
*17:59.780- 18:08.660* :  that the death toll is around 2,500 and maybe more than that. But thousands of houses were damaged
*18:08.660- 18:16.380* :  even this morning. Many more houses were destroyed or damaged because most of the houses in that part
*18:16.380- 18:24.380* :  of Afghanistan are made of mud bricks. They don't have resistance when there is an earthquake.
*18:25.060- 18:31.860* :  Another point is that many people in that area are very poor. They rely on farming and livestock
*18:31.980- 18:37.920* :  and the earthquakes have killed much of their livestock as well. It has been arriving,
*18:37.920- 18:44.720* :  but it is slow. And the Taliban government have been appealing from the international community
*18:44.720- 18:52.060* :  and have won business persons to donate. But the UN agencies have been active there and the
*18:52.060- 18:57.220* :  Taliban government agencies are also operating. They have formed a special commission to help people,
*18:57.220- 19:04.780* :  the survivors. And they have also pledged that they will build new houses for the people
*19:05.380- 19:14.060* :  whose houses were destroyed. Now on updates on a story we covered in our previous
*19:14.060- 19:21.080* :  podcast, a possible attack on a major European gas pipeline. NATO has warned of a strong response
*19:21.080- 19:27.260* :  if there is evidence that it was sabotaged. The Baltic connector running from Finland to Estonia
*19:27.260- 19:32.780* :  was shut down on Sunday after suddenly losing pressure. NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
*19:32.780- 19:37.080* :  spoke ahead of a meeting of Defence Ministers. The important thing now is to establish what
*19:37.080- 19:44.600* :  happened and how this could happen. If it is proven to be a deliberate attack on NATO critical
*19:44.600- 19:50.860* :  infrastructure, then this will be, of course, serious, but it will also be met by a united
*19:51.540- 19:54.380* :  and determined response from NATO.
*19:54.880- 19:58.940* :  Our Europe region editor Danny Eberhard gave us this update on the investigation.
*19:59.440- 20:02.820* :  The authorities tracked down where the leak has taken place. So that was the first thing.
*20:02.820- 20:08.560* :  The Estonian Defence Minister has said significant force was used in damaging the pipeline
*20:08.560- 20:14.900* :  and he spoke about this mechanical impact or mechanical destruction. So I think investigators
*20:14.900- 20:20.380* :  are looking at theories of either accidental damage. So perhaps something like a large ship's
*20:20.380- 20:24.960* :  anchor coming down on the pipeline or being dragged in a storm and breaking it that way
*20:25.260- 20:30.260* :  or something deliberate and the fear obviously is that it was something deliberate and sabotage.
*20:30.720- 20:38.260* :  There is a Norwegian seismological institute that detected a seismic signal at a time that coincides
*20:38.260- 20:44.340* :  with the events and also in a location actually quite close to Nord Stream gas pipelines that
*20:44.340- 20:51.240* :  cross it. It said that this could be a possible explosion, something less than 100 kilograms of TNT
*20:51.240- 20:56.980* :  in explosive yield, so relatively small, but researchers there also say that it could be
*20:56.980- 21:02.420* :  something, for example, like gas bursting out of a ruptured gas pipeline at pressure.
*21:02.820- 21:08.220* :  So they're not saying it's an explosion. NATO is in touch with the authorities in both Finland
*21:08.220- 21:12.260* :  and Estonia about their investigations and how to respond.
*21:12.580- 21:17.240* :  You mentioned Nord Stream and this, of course, isn't the first time that an undersea pipeline
*21:17.240- 21:24.380* :  has been damaged. Yeah, the Nord Stream pipelines, which go from Russia to Germany, were severed in
*21:24.380- 21:30.820* :  big explosions in September of last year. Three or four pipelines were damaged, two were actually
*21:30.820- 21:36.200* :  exporting gas at the time and one was about to or the Russians hoped it was about to open.
*21:36.880- 21:43.380* :  But there is a difference. The signal that was detected in this incident was much smaller than
*21:43.380- 21:48.640* :  the signals that were detected in the Nord Stream gas incidents, which were clearly explosive.
*21:49.060- 21:54.700* :  A Europe region editor, Danny Eberhardt. That's been described as the world's ugliest shoe,
*21:54.700- 21:59.940* :  but after a surge in popularity, the German sandalmaker Birkenstock is making its debut on the
*21:59.940- 22:04.960* :  New York Stock Exchange. In less than three years, the company has doubled in value and is now
*22:04.960- 22:11.540* :  worth roughly $8.6 billion. It appears much of that success is down to a series of marketing deals
*22:11.540- 22:16.360* :  that even featured in the Barbie movie, but can Birkenstock maintain this momentum?
*22:16.940- 22:20.820* :  Marguerite Lerona is a fashion analyst at EuroMonitor International.
*22:21.360- 22:28.140* :  I think Birkenstock have a very good value proposition. They're 250-year-old browned from Germany.
*22:28.220- 22:35.000* :  They have this reputation of craftsmanship, know-how, and they're really famous for their designer.
*22:35.720- 22:40.780* :  Flat leather sandals have had many nicknames over the years, but they've also managed to
*22:41.540- 22:46.320* :  raise the hype around the brown with these partnerships. You mentioned Barbie movie, but they've
*22:46.320- 22:53.940* :  also had collection with Valentino, Dior, Jill Sanders, and many other designers, so they really
*22:53.940- 23:01.000* :  managed to elevate the brown desirability. I think it's important for them to retain their identity
*23:01.040- 23:08.240* :  because consumers appreciate the consistency of their design, of their quality, and that's
*23:08.360- 23:13.560* :  something key that the brown should retain in future. They will have to ensure that
*23:14.860- 23:20.660* :  they strike these partnerships and collaborations regularly, as they've done in the past,
*23:20.680- 23:26.960* :  but always finding an interesting designer or movie or celebrity to collaborate with.
*23:27.640- 23:32.800* :  And it's great to build the browned hype, the engagement around the brown, to tell the story
*23:32.800- 23:37.220* :  they want to tell. Marguerite Lerona, fashion analyst at EuroMonitor International.
*23:37.940- 23:42.040* :  It is the Rolling Stones' first album of original songs in nearly two decades.
*23:42.040- 23:47.020* :  Ahead of the release of Hackney Diamonds, guitarist Keith Richards, who is almost 80,
*23:47.020- 23:53.260* :  has told the BBC he is ready to go back on the road. He's been speaking to our music correspondent Mark
*23:57.260- 24:02.560* :  Savage. My job is to keep that ridden thing going and to be a reliable part of the rhythm section.
*24:05.820- 24:09.040* :  So will those coming go riffs last forever.
*24:14.720- 24:19.140* :  You're in love affair with the guitar. That's kind of the defining thing about your career,
*24:19.140- 24:22.500* :  but what's the fascination with it that keeps you coming back?
*24:22.700- 24:26.940* :  The fascinating thing is about it is that the more you play it, the less you know it.
*24:27.540- 24:31.760* :  And I don't know if this is a sensitive question, but obviously you've struggled a little bit
*24:31.760- 24:34.600* :  with arthritis in your fingers. Has that changed the way you play?
*24:34.840- 24:40.040* :  Not only enough, I've no doubt it has, but it's not from, I don't have any pain.
*24:40.040- 24:46.800* :  It's a sort of benign version apparently. I think if I've slowed down a little bit,
*24:47.200- 24:53.420* :  it's probably due more to age than to any particular thing. And also I found that interesting.
*24:53.420- 24:57.820* :  I was like, well I can't quite do that anymore, but the guitar was showing me to
*24:57.820- 25:02.360* :  well, there's another way of doing this. You know, some finger will go one space different.
*25:04.360- 25:06.780* :  It is a whole new door just opened here.
*25:10.540- 25:13.920* :  So we kept it a simple puzzle and they actually cut this record
*25:13.920- 25:20.440* :  primary to be a vinyl record, you know, with a cover, a plastic thing that you pull out and put
*25:20.440- 25:24.920* :  on a turntable. Do you still listen to vinyl? Is that how you prefer to play your music?
*25:24.920- 25:30.660* :  Hard the best sound if you really want to listen to a record properly. I mean, digital is toy
*25:30.660- 25:39.800* :  term, synthesizers. Now you have A, which is even more superficial and artificial.
*25:48.400- 25:52.540* :  Sweet Signed of Heaven is one of the songs that's really going to stand out. It's a huge blues
*25:52.540- 25:59.060* :  gospel song and you've got Lady Gaga trading vocal hooks with Mick. And also there's Stevie Wonder
*25:59.060- 26:07.760* :  on there as well, which is sort of the thing only happens when you record in L.A. Guess who's dropped
*26:07.760- 26:14.400* :  by Lady Gaga is a piece of work. I've working with her because she has a great attitude towards
*26:14.400- 26:19.960* :  things and I'm a great voice and I always want to see her play off against Mick.
*26:23.900- 26:28.960* :  There's so much energy to the music on this record. It feels like it's designed to play live.
*26:28.960- 26:34.680* :  Have you got plans to take it on the road? Basically, yeah, that's the plot. It's next year,
*26:34.680- 26:40.300* :  take it on the road and if everybody's still standing. And I guess that brings me to the question
*26:40.300- 26:44.340* :  everybody asks you, but will this ever end? Will the stones just keep going?
*26:44.560- 26:52.580* :  My answer is I'm not nostradamus. Of course it's going to end sometime, but everybody's in good
*26:52.580- 27:02.020* :  fettle. There's no particular rush. We have a great fun doing this and this is what we do.
*27:04.460- 27:06.320* :  Keith Richards talking to Mark Savage.
*27:09.340- 27:12.820* :  And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*27:12.820- 27:17.620* :  This edition was mixed by Chris Lovelock and produced by Chantal Hartle, our editors Karen Martin.
*27:17.740- 27:19.900* :  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
