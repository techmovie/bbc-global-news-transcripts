*00:38.180- 00:46.160* :  World Service. I'm Charlotte Gallagher and at 13 hours GMT on Monday, the second of October,
*00:46.160- 00:53.760* :  these are our main stories. The EU says it's committed supporting Kyiv as US funding for Ukraine's
*00:53.760- 01:00.080* :  war effort comes under threat. Emergency workers in Mexico search for survivors after a church
*01:00.080- 01:06.300* :  roof collapses. Two scientists are awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine for their efforts to develop
*01:06.300- 01:15.440* :  COVID-19 vaccines. Also in this podcast, we are just here to prevent people to die.
*01:15.660- 01:20.060* :  Is that when people calling because they cannot feel their legs or their hands in winter?
*01:20.200- 01:22.780* :  And unfortunately, sometimes they have to undertake their fingers.
*01:23.420- 01:28.600* :  We investigate the perilous journey thousands of migrants are making across Europe
*01:29.100- 01:35.320* :  and the new high-speed train that will cut travel time in Indonesia by more than two hours.
*01:39.980- 01:45.980* :  But first, many billions of dollars have been donated in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's
*01:45.980- 01:52.360* :  invasion. But any future funding from the US appears to be under threat. After politicians there
*01:52.360- 01:59.200* :  agreed a last-minute budget, which excluded any new aid for Kyiv. This has got the EU worried
*01:59.200- 02:05.320* :  today foreign ministers from all 27 member countries are meeting in Kyiv to discuss continued
*02:05.320- 02:11.220* :  funding and Ukraine joining the block in the future. The EU's top diplomat, Joseph Perrell,
*02:11.220- 02:16.340* :  said it was important to express solidarity and support for the Ukrainian people.
*02:16.820- 02:21.660* :  We see unity from the beginning of the war. Everybody has been putting money and political
*02:21.660- 02:26.840* :  commitments in spite of all that. Even countries who are reluctant to the sanctions,
*02:26.840- 02:31.980* :  they have been voting in favor of the sanctions. I am worried by the last decision of the Congress
*02:31.980- 02:39.840* :  about the Ukrainian funding. But one thing is clear to us, Europeans, for us, the war
*02:39.840- 02:46.640* :  or Russia against Ukraine is an existential threat. And we have to react according with that.
*02:47.220- 02:52.240* :  Ukraine's foreign minister, Demetro Kaleber, said he believed US support for Ukraine
*02:52.240- 02:58.520* :  would resume at some point. We are now working with both sides of the Congress to make sure that
*02:58.540- 03:05.260* :  it does not repeat again under any certain. We don't feel that the US word has been shattered
*03:05.260- 03:12.520* :  because the United States understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger
*03:12.520- 03:19.180* :  than just Ukraine. So how damaging is Western funding for Teague to Ukraine's war effort?
*03:19.660- 03:24.000* :  I've been speaking to our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhard, who told me about the focus
*03:24.000- 03:29.840* :  of today's meeting in Kyiv. It's an informal meeting. It's historic and very symbolic in the
*03:29.840- 03:36.200* :  sense that it's the first such meeting to take place outside the EU's borders. But there won't
*03:36.200- 03:42.120* :  be any concrete decisions made. They'll be discussing things like President Zelensky's plan for
*03:42.120- 03:47.360* :  peace, which is something that Russia itself says is a non-starter. They're also talking about
*03:47.360- 03:53.880* :  aid, continued aid, and they are talking about things like how to protect Ukraine from an expected
*03:54.600- 03:58.800* :  renewed assault on its energy network. So Anna-Lena Bearbock, the German foreign minister,
*03:59.200- 04:04.740* :  has been saying things like, Ukraine needs more generators, for example, to as well as air
*04:04.740- 04:10.280* :  defenses to prevent against a renewed assault of the type we saw last winter.
*04:10.600- 04:15.520* :  And we just heard from the Ukrainian foreign minister very much confident he says in US support
*04:15.520- 04:20.540* :  for Ukraine. Do you think that is the reality of the situation? I'm sure Ukraine and the EU,
*04:20.540- 04:26.960* :  of course, will be worried? Well, it's clearly concerning both for Kyiv and for the wider EU.
*04:27.520- 04:32.880* :  The Ukraine element of this is part of a wider domestic dispute within the US. So,
*04:32.880- 04:40.180* :  hard-line Republicans have been trying to get serious spending cuts, force that on the Biden
*04:40.180- 04:48.060* :  administration. And Ukraine's spending is part of that. Now both President Biden and the leaders
*04:48.340- 04:54.080* :  of the Republican and Democrat parties in, for example, the Senate have stressed their
*04:54.080- 04:59.360* :  commitment to providing Ukraine with long-term support. So there's moves now to try to force
*04:59.400- 05:05.280* :  a vote on specifically on Ukraine military funding in a separate vote away from the wider budget.
*05:05.880- 05:14.060* :  And what is Russia saying? The Kremlin is seizing on any instance of division amongst or
*05:14.060- 05:20.660* :  perceived division. So it says that basically the US move is a sign of conflict fatigue and it says
*05:20.660- 05:28.440* :  this will grow. It's been seized on also, for example, the recent result in Slovakia's election
*05:28.440- 05:35.680* :  where a party seem to be more pro-Russia is in looks like it may well become the next government.
*05:36.160- 05:41.000* :  And also things like, for example, the route between Ukraine and Poland on grain. Now,
*05:41.000- 05:46.660* :  a lot of Europeans say these are small issues they're solvable. The French foreign minister
*05:46.720- 05:52.620* :  today going into the meeting said, Russia should not look on this as a sign of conflict fatigue.
*05:52.620- 05:59.600* :  Basically, this is a sign of ongoing EU support and that the Russia shouldn't take any comfort from
*05:59.600- 06:06.360* :  from the things it's seen in recent days. Danny Aberhardt, emergency services in Mexico have worked
*06:06.360- 06:13.120* :  through the night after a church collapsed in the coastal town of Cedar Madero, at least 10 people
*06:13.120- 06:18.360* :  including three children are thought to have died when the roof caved in during mass on Sunday.
*06:18.360- 06:23.580* :  The Red Cross said about 80 people in church at the time of the collapse. journalist Frank
*06:23.580- 06:29.120* :  Contreras gave us this update from Mexico City. Rescueers have been working for hours now,
*06:29.520- 06:36.080* :  pulling rubble by hand. They've been able to rescue one or two people live from under the rubble
*06:36.760- 06:43.560* :  and so there's still hope that the bishop says that the roof collapsed right around the major
*06:43.560- 06:49.380* :  moment of the mass on Sunday and the afternoon there. The church was packed with about 100 people
*06:50.160- 06:56.580* :  and people were lined up to take the communion. Of course, that's sort of the climax of the Catholic
*06:56.580- 07:04.820* :  mass and that's when the roof came down on top of them. Bricks, concrete and of course steel support
*07:05.940- 07:09.740* :  structures coming down on top of the people. Now, there's a bit of hope at this hour because
*07:10.820- 07:15.880* :  the experts on location, their national guard units and Red Cross officials are reporting that
*07:16.180- 07:21.360* :  some of the rubble came down on top of the pews in the church so that could open the possibility
*07:21.360- 07:27.240* :  of air passages under all of that heavy tonnage. It's still unclear what actually caused this.
*07:27.520- 07:33.100* :  It could have been a bad structural design. It could have been a building error,
*07:33.100- 07:38.020* :  something of that nature, according to authorities. Along that Gulf coast of Mexico,
*07:38.020- 07:43.320* :  all along the coast, they're building structures of that size are generally made of concrete,
*07:44.060- 07:49.980* :  steel and some bricks as well. Some of those structures are very strong. They've stood,
*07:50.320- 07:55.500* :  you know, tremendous hurricanes and even earthquakes in that part of Mexico. But there are other
*07:55.500- 08:01.960* :  structures that don't pass inspection and so there's speculation that that could be one of the
*08:01.960- 08:08.660* :  issues here with the church in question. Frank Contreras, the UN says the number of migrants who
*08:08.660- 08:15.200* :  have died or disappeared crossing from North Africa to Europe has tripled since last year. Italy
*08:15.200- 08:21.100* :  is the main entry point to the EU, but many who arrive there don't want to stay and increasing
*08:21.100- 08:26.300* :  numbers are traveling north to try to cross the border into France. Our Italy correspondent Mark
*08:26.300- 08:29.860* :  Lohan has been to see the perilous journey some are attempting.
*08:31.340- 08:35.860* :  We are between Italy and France, here on the left. We are Italy, down the right. We are France.
*08:36.400- 08:42.780* :  In the thick of night, we climb the steep rocky paths of the Alps in a four by four of the Red Cross,
*08:43.340- 08:50.420* :  along routes that migrants are taking by foot. Volunteer Jessica Ostorero tells me 150 a day
*08:50.420- 08:57.300* :  and now taking this route between Italy and France, double recent months as they seek a new way north.
*08:57.820- 09:02.980* :  We are not here to help people cross the border or stop them. We are just here to help people
*09:03.460- 09:08.600* :  and to prevent people to die here. Have there been migrants who have died on this route?
*09:08.600- 09:15.120* :  Yeah, unfortunately, yes. The last one was a few months ago. It happened people calling because they
*09:15.780- 09:20.180* :  cannot feel their legs or their hands in winter and unfortunately sometimes they have to
*09:20.180- 09:27.660* :  unputate their fingers. As the night wears on, the temperatures are falling further and the Red Cross
*09:28.400- 09:35.340* :  have come to hand out food and water to migrants who are waiting to cross. A couple of guys from
*09:35.760- 09:39.540* :  Egypt have just told me that they're going to try to cross two o'clock in the morning.
*09:40.900- 09:48.880* :  It will be very cold. It's going to be a very tough journey. With the Alpine route treacherous,
*09:49.080- 09:54.560* :  some are trying a different part of the border, four hours south at Ventimilia, where trains make
*09:54.560- 10:00.260* :  the short crossing. When a train has just pulled up, they're in Monton, the French side of the border
*10:00.260- 10:06.440* :  coming from Ventimilia in Italy. The French police go on board and they are checking now every train
*10:06.440- 10:14.220* :  that comes to see whether there are any undocumented migrants. There's a group of migrants
*10:14.220- 10:18.460* :  that have been pulled off the train now. They do not have passports, papers.
*10:19.500- 10:24.400* :  They're led off to be sent back into Italy, a new bottleneck emerging in the heart of Europe.
*10:26.660- 10:32.360* :  Others try narrow cliff side parts above the train station, which is where we meet Jamal,
*10:32.420- 10:36.840* :  one of the recent surge of arrivals to the southern Italian island of Lampedusa.
*10:48.760- 10:52.720* :  He's aiming to get to Britain, but has just been pushed back by French police.
*11:11.100- 11:17.020* :  The pushbacks by France facilitated by its suspension of the Schengen-free movement zone on
*11:17.020- 11:23.680* :  this border has infuriated the mayor of Ventimilia Flavio Di Muro from the far-right leg-a-party.
*11:26.360- 11:30.920* :  The EU is not working. Each country is setting its own migration limits and Italy has to
*11:30.920- 11:36.520* :  shoulder the burden alone. France suspended free movement at this border and we are forced to take
*11:36.520- 11:41.320* :  back huge numbers, which is only slowing the flow to Cali in Britain, not solving it.
*11:41.820- 11:46.500* :  Migrants have spat and urinated in the cemetery. We've reached our limit. We could become
*11:46.500- 11:54.500* :  the Lampedusa of the north. On the beaches of Ventimilia, groups huddle from across Africa and
*11:54.500- 12:00.160* :  the Middle East, waiting for their next move. The only certainty that they will try again even when
*12:00.160- 12:07.940* :  driven back. That was Mark Lone reporting from Italy. Let's head to Southeast Asia now where
*12:07.940- 12:12.160* :  there's excitement about a quicker way for people to travel from A to B.
*12:19.840- 12:26.600* :  That's the sound using a model of Indonesia's new high-speed bullet train being inaugurated by
*12:26.600- 12:32.900* :  President Joko Widodo. It connects the capital Jakarta with the fourth largest city of Bandung,
*12:32.900- 12:39.000* :  a journey that will now take just 45 minutes compared with around three hours on the old trains.
*12:39.000- 12:45.300* :  The multi-billion dollar project is partly funded by China but may prove to be less popular and
*12:45.300- 12:51.120* :  more pricey than hoped for. Here's Jason Lee. It's called Wush, a fitting name as it can reach
*12:51.120- 12:58.760* :  speeds of up to 350 kilometers per hour. It will run on a 142 kilometer long track on the world's
*12:58.760- 13:05.080* :  most populous island of Java, connecting two of Indonesia's largest metro policies, the capital
*13:05.080- 13:11.320* :  Jakarta and the city of Bandung, reducing the current journey time of around three hours to 45
*13:11.320- 13:17.920* :  minutes. Now the train was scheduled to launch four years ago but was delayed due to the pandemic.
*13:18.420- 13:24.880* :  Now the train is built by China and it's funded by a consortium of Indonesian and Chinese state
*13:24.880- 13:31.120* :  firms and it's an ambitious venture for both countries. For Indonesia's President Joko Widodo
*13:31.420- 13:37.540* :  who praised the train's speed, it's part of its plan to attract infrastructure investment deals.
*13:38.360- 13:43.700* :  For China though, it's part of its Belt and Road Initiative, a plan to set up new trade routes
*13:43.700- 13:49.660* :  linking China with the rest of the world. Now the critics of Indonesia's new high-speed railway
*13:49.660- 13:55.720* :  systems say due to its relative short distance, it might be less competitive to slower trains or
*13:55.720- 14:03.120* :  cars resulting in low demand and with little passengers even though electric trains reduce energy
*14:03.120- 14:09.920* :  consumption and pollution, it might be less cost effective and with a surge in costs, it may
*14:09.920- 14:15.580* :  prove to be a bad investment for Indonesia because it had to use state funds and alone from a
*14:15.580- 14:24.980* :  Chinese bank to keep this project afloat. That was Jason Lee reporting. Still to come on the
*14:24.980- 14:32.780* :  Global News Podcast. The songs drive the drama along and the story is based on actual

*15:52.540- 15:58.080* :  Next, the development of vaccines that would eventually change the course of the COVID-19
*15:58.080- 16:04.860* :  pandemic took many years of scientific focus and unprecedented international cooperation.
*16:05.680- 16:11.240* :  Now, two scientists who played a key role in those efforts have just been awarded this year's
*16:11.240- 16:17.840* :  Nobel Prize for Medicine, Dr. Kathleen Carrico from Hungary and Dr. Drew Weissman from the US will
*16:17.840- 16:22.320* :  share the prize. Our health correspondent, James Gallagher, told me more about the pair.
*16:22.840- 16:26.920* :  It's remarkable now, isn't it, because we've had millions and millions and millions of people
*16:26.920- 16:33.760* :  given these vaccines. But if we take it back before the COVID pandemic, mRNA vaccines was a
*16:33.980- 16:39.320* :  completely experimental technology, none of them had been officially approved and they turned
*16:39.320- 16:44.520* :  out to be remarkable in the fight against COVID. Now, if you have to go back to the origins of them,
*16:44.580- 16:51.440* :  you really have to go back to this pair in the early 1990s when they were largely considered to be
*16:51.440- 16:55.840* :  pursuing a scientific backwater. Nobody thought that what they were doing was ever really going to
*16:56.120- 17:02.660* :  amount to anything. And they were studying this, the structure called RNA and whether it could be
*17:02.660- 17:08.600* :  used to develop a completely new way of developing vaccines. And this technology that they developed
*17:08.620- 17:13.640* :  is now being used in other areas as well. Well, once COVID happened, it all got really quite
*17:13.640- 17:17.800* :  exciting for this field because the advantage that these vaccines have over other styles of
*17:17.800- 17:21.660* :  developing vaccines is incredibly fast and incredibly flexible, so you can develop new vaccines
*17:21.660- 17:26.960* :  really quickly. So it's being investigated for a whole range of different infectious diseases,
*17:27.640- 17:31.660* :  but as well as that, it's even being investigated in cancer. So there's like this really big idea,
*17:32.060- 17:37.120* :  exciting at the moment, where you would look inside somebody who has cancer, you'd analyze their
*17:37.120- 17:41.140* :  tumor and see if there was something in there that you could train the immune system to attack,
*17:41.140- 17:46.260* :  and you'd use this technology to basically train your body how to attack your own cancer.
*17:46.640- 17:51.160* :  So there's kind of like lots of really interesting, exciting opportunities with this technology
*17:51.160- 17:56.380* :  that being researched at the moment. And what effects has COVID-19 and vaccine conspiracy
*17:56.420- 18:01.180* :  had on the development of this mRNA vaccine? Because I feel like it's something that people do talk
*18:01.180- 18:04.820* :  about a lot on social media. Yeah, yeah, it always comes up on social media, doesn't it? I think
*18:05.400- 18:11.980* :  that the thing, there's always been some degree of kind of conspiracy theory around vaccines
*18:11.980- 18:16.920* :  and we've seen that for years. What changed a little bit during the pandemic and with the
*18:16.920- 18:23.140* :  emergence of these new vaccines was that concept that corners had been cut, that it was all being
*18:23.140- 18:26.580* :  rushed, those were the kinds of things that were being claimed. Despite the fact they went through
*18:26.580- 18:30.460* :  the same kind of like scientific process that vaccines would normally do. So that was kind of like
*18:31.100- 18:36.380* :  the thing that changed, but ultimately it always comes down to that kind of group of people
*18:36.380- 18:42.580* :  that buy into the idea that vaccines are dangerous despite the overwhelming medical science
*18:42.580- 18:49.180* :  same the opposite. James Galahher. Johnny Kitsugawa was one of the biggest names in Japan's
*18:49.180- 18:56.000* :  entertainment industry until his death in 2019. His legacy now is not the boy bands he created,
*18:56.000- 19:02.260* :  but a series of sexual abuse allegations against him. Last month an investigation found Kitsugawa
*19:02.260- 19:08.500* :  had abused hundreds of boys and young men over his six decade career. There had been some criticism
*19:08.500- 19:13.940* :  that his former talent agency, Johnny and associates chose to keep the name of a sexual predator,
*19:14.600- 19:18.900* :  but that's about to change as our correspondent in North East Asia, Jean McKenzie explains.
*19:19.540- 19:25.540* :  Johnny Kitsugawa was one of the richest and most powerful men in Japan. For decades he was responsible
*19:25.540- 19:30.620* :  for launching the country's most famous boy bands and artists, but last month an independent
*19:31.520- 19:36.280* :  investigation found he'd sexually assaulted many of the boys and young men he'd made famous.
*19:36.900- 19:42.340* :  As the agency scrambles to repair its reputation, it has announced the existing company will be
*19:42.340- 19:48.420* :  renamed and will deal solely with identifying and compensating victims, while a new company
*19:48.420- 19:55.320* :  will be created to manage the talent. It says more than 300 victims have so far come forward asking
*19:55.320- 20:01.120* :  for compensation. Since news of the abuse broke, broadcasters and brands have stopped using the
*20:01.120- 20:07.360* :  agency's talent. This restructure is an attempt to win back their support. Jean McKenzie.
*20:08.100- 20:15.520* :  Authorities in Armenia say that almost the entire population of 120,000 ethnic Armenians
*20:15.960- 20:21.660* :  and have gone from the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave which came under full azary control last week.
*20:21.660- 20:27.660* :  Tens of thousands of refugees have been provided with temporary accommodation inside Armenia,
*20:27.660- 20:33.540* :  but there are still many in need of a roof over their heads. Our correspondent, Rehant Meetri,
*20:33.940- 20:38.480* :  has visited one of the shelters in the Armenian town of Gorish and sent this report.
*20:41.860- 20:49.440* :  Playing under a peaceful sky at last, just two weeks ago these children were hiding in bomb shelters.
*20:50.200- 20:57.840* :  15-year-old Masis says everything still feels like a bad dream. When on September the 19th,
*20:57.840- 21:03.140* :  Azerbaijan launched its military offensive to establish full control over Nagorno-Karabakh,
*21:03.700- 21:06.500* :  he was at school in his hometown of Martuni.
*21:08.620- 21:15.720* :  At around 2pm, we finished lessons at school. I was on my way home with a friend. We heard loud
*21:15.720- 21:21.400* :  banging at first. I thought it was a military exercise. Then the explosion started to happen
*21:21.400- 21:26.960* :  one after another. We ran to the nearby police station to hide in the basement to save our lives.
*21:28.260- 21:33.580* :  Masis is sheltering in this center in the outskirts of Gorish with his parents, siblings,
*21:33.580- 21:39.600* :  and his aunt, Lucineh. Everyone here is traumatized by the violence and the sudden
*21:39.660- 21:47.060* :  uprooting from their homes. We didn't imagine that all this would happen to us says Lucineh,
*21:47.200- 21:51.560* :  the mother of four. We have been abandoned. We're alone, she says.
*21:52.640- 22:00.220* :  The Armenian authorities have provided temporary accommodation to 35,000 refugees out of the 100,000
*22:00.220- 22:06.360* :  that were forced to flee Nagorno-Karabakh. But this shelter is the initiative of a local
*22:06.360- 22:14.940* :  non-governmental organization, women in network. We adopted our whole as a shelter, providing them
*22:15.460- 22:23.980* :  accommodation, food, some hygiene items. This warm and welcoming place is only a temporary
*22:23.980- 22:30.780* :  solution for Karabakh Armenians that are still coming to terms with the events of the past weeks.
*22:30.860- 22:37.660* :  Their lives have been turned upside down, and what these people need the most is a place they
*22:37.660- 22:45.900* :  can call home. Inga is waiting for transportation. She decided to move her family to Hrasdan in
*22:45.900- 22:53.620* :  central Armenia. Now that the unrecognized Republic of Artsakh sees to exist, she's asking
*22:53.620- 23:00.980* :  what was all the sacrifice for. Let God give us peace, to our land. I do not want anything
*23:00.980- 23:09.920* :  else. I just want peace. Gohar is drawing the road from Karabakh. It's empty, she says, because
*23:09.920- 23:17.440* :  everyone has left. That was Rayhan Dimitri. Finally, it's nearly 40 years since millions of
*23:17.440- 23:23.060* :  people around the world watch the charity concert Live Aid featuring performances by David Bowie,
*23:23.060- 23:29.300* :  Queen and U2. Now it's been turned into a stage musical, which will feature many of the songs
*23:29.300- 23:35.340* :  performed on that day in 1985. Our entertainment correspondent, Colin Patterson, has been finding
*23:35.340- 23:43.120* :  out more. It's 12 noon in London, 7 am in Philadelphia, and around the world it's time for Live Aid.
*23:43.600- 23:47.500* :  One of the most famous concerts of all time has been turned into a musical.
*23:54.520- 24:00.180* :  Live Aid, which raised money for family relief in Ethiopia, was watched by an estimated 1.5
*24:00.180- 24:07.400* :  billion people in 1985. Now a stage version is heading to Olvig Theatre in London, with the blessing
*24:07.400- 24:10.100* :  of the original organiser, Bob Geldoff.
*24:10.840- 24:17.780* :  I bet you've got a lot of thoughts. Live Aid, the musical happened 40 years ago, was unwembley.
*24:18.400- 24:24.580* :  They came and said, we know you're going to say no, but we want to do it because our dads have never
*24:25.240- 24:28.780* :  stopped talking about this day. We think it's theatre.
*24:29.200- 24:34.040* :  We come with you. Just for one day.
*24:35.440- 24:40.080* :  The musical is called Just for One Day, after the line in David Bowie's Heroes.
*24:40.940- 24:45.120* :  Are there people playing David Bowie in Bono or Freddie Mercury?
*24:45.120- 24:49.600* :  No, it's not a tribute thing. I wouldn't have anything to do with that.
*24:50.520- 24:55.820* :  The Band-Aid Charitable Trust will receive 10% of all ticket sales. Bob Geldoff hopes
*24:55.820- 25:02.340* :  the musical worlds who are possibly internationally after its original nine-week run started in January.
*25:06.800- 25:08.400* :  Live Aid, loves again.
*25:09.880- 25:11.360* :  That was Colin Patterson reporting.
*25:14.640- 25:19.160* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the Global News podcast
