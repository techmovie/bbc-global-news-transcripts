*00:31.340- 00:33.980* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:36.560- 00:40.840* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Monday, the 23rd of October, these are our main stories.
*00:41.420- 00:45.640* :  A number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid have crossed into Gaza from Egypt,
*00:45.640- 00:48.080* :  the second such convoy in two days.
*00:48.080- 00:53.740* :  The Israeli army has apologized for what it says was the accidental shelling by one of its tanks
*00:54.260- 00:55.700* :  of an Egyptian military post.
*00:56.260- 01:01.320* :  A surge in violence against US interests in Iraq has prompted Washington to order many diplomatic
*01:01.320- 01:02.940* :  staff and families to leave.
*01:05.640- 01:12.320* :  Also in this podcast, people get to get a real-time sense of what happens when North Koreans flee.
*01:12.320- 01:18.080* :  We see their journey from the beginning and we get to go on that journey with them once they flee.
*01:18.640- 01:23.260* :  A new documentary tells the dangers people face as they try to escape North Korea.
*01:27.100- 01:29.220* :  We start with the conflict in the Middle East.
*01:29.580- 01:35.040* :  The United Nations has confirmed that another 14 aid trucks have entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
*01:35.900- 01:40.880* :  The UN's humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, described the convoy as a small glimmer of hope
*01:40.880- 01:46.140* :  for those in need, but he said much more help was needed. Two million people live in the territory
*01:46.140- 01:51.680* :  and since the attacks by Hamas militants two weeks ago, Israel had put in place a total blockade
*01:51.680- 01:57.520* :  of Gaza. Hamas is designated a terror organization by many Western governments, including the UK.
*01:58.360- 02:02.720* :  The aid vehicles had been detained on Sunday at the Raffa crossing for several hours
*02:03.140- 02:07.240* :  whilst they were searched by officials. The White House says President Biden and the Israeli
*02:07.240- 02:13.660* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have confirmed there will now be a continued flow of aid into Gaza.
*02:14.300- 02:17.760* :  I heard more from our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem.
*02:18.480- 02:22.520* :  Well, there was another 14 trucks carrying food, water and medicine.
*02:22.940- 02:27.080* :  There were supposed to be 17 trucks going through. I'm not quite sure why it's only 14,
*02:27.680- 02:32.900* :  but I think even though we've heard from Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu that they've agreed
*02:32.900- 02:39.640* :  that this flow of aid should now be continuous, it's worth noting that so far it's pitifully small amounts.
*02:40.440- 02:46.400* :  And crucially, it does not include fuel, and the UN is arguing that unless they get their fuel
*02:46.400- 02:51.460* :  stocks replenished in the next couple of days, their entire humanitarian effort will grind to a halt
*02:52.100- 02:56.040* :  because the fuel is needed to, obviously, for the trucks that drive the aid into Gaza. It's
*02:56.040- 03:02.740* :  needed for hospital generators and water purification plants. And so they are insistent that fuel
*03:02.740- 03:07.920* :  should be part of this deal, and the Israelis are equally adamant that it should not, and that is a
*03:07.920- 03:13.360* :  problem. We saw that there was a hold-up today at the Raffa crossing. Digistically, it's going to
*03:13.360- 03:18.240* :  be very difficult getting enough aid in through just one entry point, isn't it?
*03:18.780- 03:23.720* :  Yes, but it's not going to change. That is the only entry point, and that will be the only entry point,
*03:23.720- 03:28.820* :  I suspect, until Israel completes its military operations in Gaza. And that could be a matter of
*03:28.820- 03:34.900* :  weeks, if not months. The UN have said that they need not, you know, 15 or 20 trucks a day, but
*03:34.900- 03:39.940* :  100 or 200 trucks a day, particularly if they have to carry water, because that's a very bulky
*03:39.940- 03:46.540* :  thing to transport. It is in increasingly short supply in the Gaza Strip, and so water is part
*03:46.540- 03:51.600* :  of the shipments that have to go through. And so, you know, the whole thing is just going to have
*03:51.600- 03:59.640* :  to ramp up hugely to address what are mounting humanitarian difficulties inside the Gaza Strip.
*04:00.060- 04:04.340* :  I'm not sure how much to read into this, but I was seeing today there was a cross-border aid
*04:04.340- 04:10.760* :  into Gaza by a small number of Israeli troops, and one Israeli troop was reported to have been killed
*04:10.780- 04:17.540* :  in that. To what extent are we seeing more of a build-up and more signs that this could be the
*04:17.540- 04:22.680* :  starter of some kind of land invasion? Well, the Israelis have indicated that they have already
*04:22.680- 04:28.800* :  conducted a number of smaller incursions, small teams going in, probably with a couple of
*04:28.800- 04:35.180* :  objectives in mind, one to start probing the Hamas defenses, and also to look for clues as to
*04:35.180- 04:42.460* :  the whereabouts of hostages. I think the ground operation may not be just a big bang, it may
*04:42.460- 04:48.280* :  gradually escalate and evolve as larger teams go in with specific objectives in mind,
*04:48.280- 04:54.180* :  but certainly Israel's Defence Minister speaking today indicated that the moment for this to start
*04:54.180- 05:00.320* :  was close, and that it could last one, two, or even three months. Paul Adams in Jerusalem there.
*05:01.280- 05:06.220* :  Well, Israel has stepped up its bombardment of the Gaza Strip ahead of a possible ground offensive,
*05:06.800- 05:12.920* :  more than two weeks after those attacks by Hamas that left 1,400 Israelis dead. According to
*05:12.920- 05:21.120* :  Hamas, more than 260 people were killed over a 24-hour period, many of them children. The BBC's
*05:21.120- 05:26.320* :  Rushdie Abu Alouf lives and works in Gaza, and has been reporting on the situation there since
*05:26.320- 05:32.380* :  the Hamas attacks on Israel. On October 7th, on Sunday, he visited a camp for internally displaced
*05:32.380- 05:39.160* :  people in Khan Unis, a city about 10 kilometers into Gaza from the Rafa crossing. He sent this
*05:39.160- 05:48.640* :  report. The scene here inside the Honor Wakam were about 210 housing, more than 3,000 families
*05:48.640- 05:55.440* :  is chaotic. People are struggling to find food, people are struggling to find water. Outside the
*05:55.440- 06:01.080* :  camp, there is shops, people are selling dry food, people are selling canned food. I can see
*06:01.080- 06:08.200* :  Shambu, people are selling batteries, power banks for people to charge their phones because electricity
*06:08.280- 06:14.000* :  is always a challenge, but I noticed people are selling all the glows. They found them somewhere.
*06:14.720- 06:18.640* :  I tried to ask the guy, he said that we try to help those people who like
*06:19.140- 06:25.020* :  flee their house without having to collect any clothing or any belongings with them. So,
*06:25.460- 06:31.500* :  they are trying to sell what they have for a very little price, as they said. One of the people
*06:31.500- 06:36.260* :  who are trying to maintain the security in this place, he said security is a challenge because
*06:36.260- 06:42.720* :  there is no longer police are maintaining law and order in this area. Also, he said people are
*06:42.720- 06:47.880* :  fighting because when you have a very little food, very little water, very little electricity,
*06:47.900- 06:54.380* :  people will be fighting, everyone will want his shape. And what they said is extra. They said we
*06:54.380- 07:00.260* :  try to register the people who are under camp so we can calculate how much food and water they,
*07:00.260- 07:05.760* :  but they said every day more and more people are coming. They are all of them mainly coming from
*07:05.760- 07:11.200* :  the Gaza City and the north, the place that Israel asked the people to leave to the south,
*07:11.780- 07:18.040* :  but in the south, the humanitarian crisis are getting deep and deep and with the 20 trucks coming
*07:18.040- 07:25.580* :  in from the border, there isn't enough at all. People are asking for more food, more fuel to be
*07:25.580- 07:32.740* :  able to survive. The BBC's Rusty Abu Aluf in Gaza, well, eight agencies are said to be concerned
*07:32.740- 07:39.340* :  about the situation in the territory. Shainu Lau is an advisor with the Norwegian refugee council.
*07:40.000- 07:48.380* :  We have 54 colleagues in Gaza who are in various degrees of panic and chaos. We have 11 staff
*07:48.380- 07:55.620* :  who are still remain above the Wadi Gaza demarcation line who report just harrowing, harrowing
*07:55.620- 08:00.840* :  conditions. I learned today that one of our colleagues, he spent the entire day just to find
*08:00.840- 08:05.900* :  some bread and a gallon of water for his family, which includes his pregnant wife. Our colleagues
*08:05.900- 08:12.220* :  in the south report difficult conditions as well. Struggles to find basic necessities,
*08:12.640- 08:17.920* :  five hour wait to get bread this morning, similar to, as your correspondent explained,
*08:19.400- 08:24.040* :  detention in the streets that's causing to internal fighting, because people are living under
*08:24.040- 08:29.760* :  such tremendous pressure and stress. We've heard that from colleagues that they really don't know
*08:29.760- 08:34.560* :  how much longer they can take it anymore. They're under tremendous stress. Those who have moved to
*08:34.560- 08:39.620* :  the south are constantly telling us about the ongoing air strike that are happening there.
*08:40.100- 08:44.780* :  One of our colleagues lost her six-year-old son this week in an air strike in Rafa,
*08:45.400- 08:50.860* :  most southern part of Gaza. Well, beneath that Wadi Gaza line that people were told to move south.
*08:51.760- 08:54.540* :  Shainu Lau from the Norwegian refugee council.
*08:55.660- 09:00.900* :  Well, conditions in Gaza's hospitals continue to deteriorate nearly two weeks after the Israeli
*09:01.180- 09:06.800* :  government announced that siege of the territory cutting off access to water, food, fuel, and
*09:06.800- 09:13.320* :  medicines, apart from the small amount that's gone in from Egypt this weekend. Al-Shifa hospital
*09:13.320- 09:20.720* :  is the main medical facility in Gaza City. Dr. Kassan Abu Siddhar is a British Palestinian surgeon
*09:20.720- 09:24.600* :  who's been working there since he went to Gaza just before the conflict erupted.
*09:25.180- 09:30.160* :  James Menendez asked him, what was the situation there on Sunday like? And as you can hear,
*09:30.180- 09:33.500* :  it's been difficult to get good communications with that hospital.
*09:34.360- 09:41.100* :  This integration of the system continues. We have more and more wounded come in. We've
*09:41.100- 09:47.380* :  run out of more and more things. We now have dressings for burns, even though we have over 70 patients
*09:47.380- 09:55.000* :  with almost 40% or more of their body surface area burned. And twice as many with less burns,
*09:55.140- 10:01.180* :  all of whom need daily, if not alternative, pay dressings, and we've run out of the
*10:01.180- 10:07.660* :  burns dressings. We've run out of a lot of the solutions that we need to treat patients.
*10:08.480- 10:17.020* :  And the stuff is not just physically exhausted. We operate around 16 to 18 hours a day. We do
*10:17.020- 10:23.780* :  10 to 12 cases and this is just one department in the hospital. We had the first eight trucks
*10:23.780- 10:30.900* :  moving through from Egypt into to Gaza on Saturday, just 20 trucks. Do you know whether any of
*10:30.900- 10:36.720* :  the supplies on those trucks have made it through to your hospital? No condition of these trucks,
*10:36.860- 10:43.700* :  they do not go beyond the south of Gaza. And none of them had medical supplies. But if you think
*10:43.700- 10:53.860* :  about how saltingly and criminally minuscule 20 trucks are for a place with 24 million people,
*10:53.860- 11:00.580* :  with a health system struggling to deal with 14,000 major injuries, this is just a
*11:00.580- 11:06.740* :  media gimmick. When we spoke a few days ago, you said that fuel was getting very, very low
*11:06.740- 11:11.680* :  indeed. And that was making it difficult to run the generators, or there was a risk that you
*11:11.680- 11:16.700* :  wouldn't be able to run the generators. I mean, what's the update on that? I mean, how close to
*11:16.700- 11:22.820* :  running out of fuel are you now? It looks like it's very close because today we've had the electricity
*11:22.820- 11:29.700* :  cut out multiple times that we've had to delay our operating list today because we haven't been
*11:29.700- 11:36.140* :  able to make sure that that that generator is going to stay on. And I know you're not a pediatrician,
*11:36.140- 11:42.380* :  but what does that mean, for example, for premature babies in neonatal care? Basically, it's a
*11:42.380- 11:48.600* :  decent, I mean, all of these do have a battery charged in case there's a short electricity,
*11:49.220- 11:54.120* :  but not for long period, and the same with the ventilators in the intensive care units.
*11:54.920- 12:01.360* :  That was Dr. Gasan Abu Sitter, a British Palestinian surgeon at the Al-Shifa hospital in Garza.
*12:02.100- 12:06.300* :  The Israeli military has expressed regret for the shelling of an Egyptian position,
*12:06.440- 12:11.100* :  near the border with Garza by one of its tanks. It said the incident near the rougher crossing
*12:11.100- 12:16.420* :  was a mistake and would be investigated. It happened as checks were carried out on the second
*12:16.420- 12:21.640* :  convoy of trucks waiting to take that humanitarian aid from Egypt to the Garza strip.
*12:22.200- 12:27.080* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Lebanon's Hezbollah militants that they
*12:27.080- 12:33.240* :  face counter strikes of unimaginable magnitude if they join the current conflict. Hezbollah is
*12:33.240- 12:39.000* :  backed by Iran and designated as a terror organization by many Western countries,
*12:39.680- 12:44.560* :  wearing a bulletproof vest as he met commandos near the Lebanese border. Mr. Netanyahu said
*12:44.560- 12:51.100* :  Israel was fighting for its existence. We are now in a double battle, one here at the Lebanon
*12:51.100- 12:56.220* :  Israel border to make sure Hezbollah back off and the other battle there in the south
*12:56.520- 13:01.760* :  to ensure a decisive victory that will crush Hamas. If Hezbollah decides to enter the war,
*13:01.760- 13:08.560* :  it will miss the second Lebanon war. It will make the mistake of its life. We will strike it with
*13:08.560- 13:15.140* :  a force. It cannot even imagine. In recent days there have been continuing cross-border exchanges
*13:15.140- 13:21.760* :  of fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Andrea Tenenti is with the UN interim peacekeeping force
*13:21.760- 13:29.020* :  in Lebanon. The security situation is tense and volatile. It has been tense and volatile for
*13:29.020- 13:33.220* :  the least couple of weeks. Everyone is concerned about the situation because this does not happen
*13:33.220- 13:40.180* :  since 2006. But at the same time, hope and also being this conflict at the moment very localized.
*13:40.180- 13:46.280* :  The hope that it would not escalate into something larger. But as it happened in the past,
*13:46.280- 13:49.860* :  it is very difficult to predict a daily escalation of conflict.
*13:49.860- 13:55.880* :  Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has ordered eligible family members and non-emergency staff
*13:55.880- 14:02.120* :  in Iraq at its embassy in Baghdad and consulate in El-Bil to leave immediately. There has been
*14:02.120- 14:07.500* :  a surge in attacks on U.S. forces there since the start of the war in Gaza. From Washington,
*14:07.500- 14:13.380* :  here is Shanghai, New Yorker. The U.S. State Department has issued that statement and they are
*14:13.380- 14:21.200* :  saying that U.S. citizens, as well as government personnel, are facing an increased risk of terrorism
*14:21.200- 14:26.540* :  and threats to their safety, including the potential for violence and kidnapping.
*14:26.540- 14:33.620* :  They weren't specific that this is related to the war between Israel and Hamas. In Gaza,
*14:33.620- 14:39.680* :  a few days ago, the U.S. also issued a worldwide caution to all American citizens.
*14:40.340- 14:43.840* :  Shanghai, New Yorker. Well, in a separate development, the White House says
*14:43.840- 14:48.160* :  President Biden has held a phone call with a number of world leaders, including the British
*14:48.160- 14:53.060* :  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, about the war between Israel and Hamas. Earlier in the day,
*14:53.060- 14:56.820* :  Mr. Biden also spoke to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*14:58.320- 15:04.480* :  When Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, it killed at least 1,400 people, mainly civilians.
*15:05.220- 15:11.540* :  Hamas also took a large group of hostages back to Gaza. It is now thought they hold 212 people captive,
*15:11.880- 15:17.420* :  among them several elderly people and some very young children. Amongst the youngest of the hostages
*15:17.420- 15:23.760* :  are 4-year-old Ariel and her brother Kaffir, who is just 9 months old. They were filmed by Hamas being
*15:23.760- 15:30.200* :  taken on October 7th, together with their mother Shuri, a teacher. Their father, Yadun Bibbas,
*15:30.200- 15:36.500* :  was also taken. Yadun's sister, Afri, is in London as part of efforts to secure their release.
*15:37.160- 15:41.780* :  She's been speaking to James Menendez about what happened to her family on October 7th.
*15:42.520- 15:49.800* :  My brother Texas, the WhatsApp family group, he had the gun. He said he's loaded and waiting.
*15:50.640- 15:54.680* :  I asked them to keep it quiet so the terrorists wouldn't hear him from inside the house.
*15:55.400- 16:00.600* :  He said we're trying to, but it's difficult with a 4-year-old and a baby. A few minutes later,
*16:00.880- 16:04.380* :  943 said they were coming in, meaning they were coming inside this house.
*16:05.460- 16:12.300* :  And that was the last time I heard from him over two weeks ago. About two or three hours later,
*16:12.840- 16:16.760* :  we got a picture of Shuri and the kids with the terrorists around him,
*16:17.000- 16:21.760* :  kidnapping them. And about two hours later, I got from a friend here in England,
*16:21.760- 16:24.820* :  she sent me the video of Shuri and the kids being kidnapped.
*16:25.420- 16:27.920* :  Because it started to circulate quite widely, didn't it?
*16:28.000- 16:30.280* :  Yeah, the Hamas posted his own videos.
*16:31.100- 16:33.280* :  And so at that point, what was going through your mind?
*16:33.920- 16:39.300* :  I was scared, like I've never been scared before. I started hearing what's going on in other
*16:39.300- 16:44.760* :  kids' team and I knew what they were doing. So I was really worried about what's going to happen
*16:44.760- 16:50.360* :  to them and no sign for my brother. And three days later, it was the morning of his birthday,
*16:50.400- 16:54.260* :  his 34th birthday. I got the first picture of him being taken as well.
*16:54.980- 17:00.080* :  I can see him there surrounded by a terrorist alive, but he's bleeding from his head.
*17:00.300- 17:03.260* :  I can see one of the terrorists holding a hammer in his head.
*17:03.980- 17:07.620* :  Do you think that military operations, particularly a ground offensive?
*17:07.620- 17:11.900* :  Do you think that should be delayed until those negotiations are able to run their course?
*17:11.900- 17:16.920* :  I'm just wondering how worried you are that if it's really so, just go into Gaza.
*17:16.960- 17:19.580* :  It's going to make it so much more difficult to get your family back.
*17:19.880- 17:22.960* :  Look, I'm just a family member. I'm not a politician. I'm not an army person.
*17:23.780- 17:26.480* :  I have to put my trust in the Israeli government and the army.
*17:26.480- 17:29.400* :  That they would do whatever they can to bring our family safe
*17:30.280- 17:32.780* :  with as much as less casualties on both sides.
*17:34.260- 17:35.000* :  Do you trust them?
*17:36.280- 17:42.480* :  I have to. I have to for my family. Otherwise, I have no hope, so I have to trust them.
*17:43.240- 17:44.520* :  That was awfully levy.
*17:47.100- 17:51.080* :  Still to come. This would be a major deal if it was just an economic story,
*17:51.080- 17:53.620* :  because we're talking about a company Foxconn.
*17:53.740- 17:56.480* :  It's one of the world's biggest makers of an electronic product.
*17:57.120- 18:01.540* :  The Taiwanese electronics maker, Foxconn, is now under investigation in China
*18:02.000- 18:05.880* :  for alleged tax violations. We look at the political machinations.
*18:11.740- 18:16.160* :  Do you ever feel a bit overwhelmed when you check the news on your phone first thing in the morning?
*18:16.260- 18:18.180* :  There's everything everywhere all at once.
*18:19.500- 18:23.000* :  I'm Hannah. I'm the presenter of What in the World from the BBC World Service.
*18:23.280- 18:25.740* :  We've the podcast making sense of the world around you,
*18:26.000- 18:30.580* :  so you can feel better about what's happening and understand what in the world is going on.
*18:30.760- 18:35.700* :  Net Zero means we're not adding any more green-hoist gases to the total in the atmosphere.
*18:35.840- 18:39.300* :  Just search for What in the World, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:40.240- 18:43.840* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now to some other news.
*18:44.800- 18:47.200* :  Russian terror, that is what the Ukrainian president,
*18:47.200- 18:50.440* :  Volodymyr Zelensky, has called a Russian missile strike,
*18:51.000- 18:53.100* :  on the north-eastern city of Harkiv.
*18:53.460- 18:56.480* :  Six postal workers were killed and more than a dozen injured
*18:56.960- 18:59.220* :  when a sorting office was hit on Saturday night.
*18:59.860- 19:03.500* :  A correspondent Jenny Hill is there in Harkiv. I asked her what she'd seen.
*19:04.040- 19:08.260* :  We arrived a little earlier in the daylight. We were able to look at what was effective
*19:08.260- 19:13.960* :  of a scene of devastation. The warehouse has a huge hole in its ceiling where the missiles
*19:13.960- 19:17.080* :  struck. We saw for ourselves the violence with which
*19:17.380- 19:20.840* :  shrapnel was flown through that space. As you'd imagine,
*19:20.840- 19:25.800* :  shards of glass bits of twisted metal remains of packages packaging and so on
*19:25.800- 19:29.460* :  and all over the warehouse and strewn outside on the yard too.
*19:29.620- 19:33.360* :  And we understand there were about 30 people working in that depot
*19:33.780- 19:36.400* :  when the missile struck just before half past 10 last night.
*19:36.880- 19:41.820* :  Sirens apparently went off, warning sirens, but those people had apparently just a few
*19:41.820- 19:44.280* :  seconds to try to get themselves too safety.
*19:44.660- 19:48.380* :  And Jenny, Harkiv is very close to the Russian border indeed.
*19:48.380- 19:52.560* :  How frequently is it attacked like this these days?
*19:53.080- 19:55.740* :  Well my understanding is that there are attacks daily.
*19:55.740- 19:58.340* :  Not all of them with missiles like this.
*19:58.900- 20:02.660* :  Not all of them resulting in deaths, but you know make no mistake about it.
*20:02.660- 20:05.320* :  You know this is a really difficult place to live.
*20:05.320- 20:08.080* :  I spoke to a manager who'd come here today.
*20:08.080- 20:11.640* :  He was here he said in the immediate aftermath of the strike last night.
*20:12.140- 20:16.420* :  And I asked him what's it like to live with that kind of threat hanging over you all the time.
*20:16.460- 20:20.460* :  And he just said he shrugged and almost said you know it's normal.
*20:20.460- 20:23.700* :  Obviously there are defenses, but they don't always work.
*20:23.700- 20:27.280* :  And your listeners will perhaps recall that certainly just within this month
*20:27.380- 20:29.560* :  there have been two really deadly strikes.
*20:29.580- 20:32.680* :  One involving the deaths of more than 50 people.
*20:32.680- 20:35.780* :  They were in a grocery or cafe when I miss I'll hit.
*20:35.980- 20:39.160* :  And then more recently a little boy and his grandmother were killed
*20:39.740- 20:41.600* :  in a strike on their apartment.
*20:41.900- 20:44.900* :  And this attack and the attacks you just mentioned, the horrific attacks,
*20:45.440- 20:47.400* :  weren't strategic targets at all it seems.
*20:47.400- 20:50.160* :  It seems that these attacks come randomly.
*20:50.560- 20:51.740* :  Well this is an interesting point.
*20:52.220- 20:56.260* :  Russia throughout this conflict has always said it does not deliberately
*20:56.380- 21:02.100* :  target civilian infrastructure and places where civilians are likely to be.
*21:02.680- 21:04.900* :  Ukraine would argue very much the opposite.
*21:05.060- 21:09.800* :  Now this warehouse is part of a really important and actually very well
*21:09.800- 21:13.800* :  loved Ukrainian postal service which has kept its deliveries,
*21:13.800- 21:16.960* :  its operations going throughout the war.
*21:17.080- 21:22.220* :  We haven't heard anything from Moscow with specific regard to today's attack not officially anyway.
*21:22.740- 21:25.960* :  But President Zelensky of Ukraine has condemned this strike
*21:26.120- 21:30.580* :  and said you know this was an attack on an ordinary civilian facility.
*21:31.720- 21:33.220* :  Jenny Hill in Kharkiv.
*21:33.740- 21:38.660* :  We're staying in Ukraine and drones have had a profound effect on the war in the country.
*21:39.100- 21:43.480* :  Just a cursory glance online shows a plethora of videos showing drones being used
*21:43.480- 21:45.240* :  by both sides in the conflict.
*21:45.900- 21:49.860* :  But now Chinese restrictions on drone exports have led to concerns
*21:49.860- 21:52.920* :  about their continuing viability as a weapon.
*21:53.580- 21:57.640* :  BBC Monitoring's Russia editor Vitaly Shumchenko investigates.
*22:00.600- 22:05.800* :  The skies above Ukraine are buzzing with drones or uncrewed aerial vehicles.
*22:05.820- 22:11.900* :  Both Ukraine and Russia are using them to conduct reconnaissance, direct artillery fire,
*22:11.900- 22:17.100* :  clear mines as well as hits enemy forces with explosives carried on board.
*22:17.100- 22:22.460* :  Many of these drones are made in China and now Chinese restrictions and drone exports
*22:22.460- 22:25.460* :  have led to concerns about their supply.
*22:26.160- 22:29.280* :  The latest came into force on the 1st of September.
*22:29.540- 22:34.280* :  They apply to long range, heavier drones as well as drone-related equipment
*22:34.280- 22:37.640* :  such as some cameras and radio modules.
*22:38.240- 22:43.740* :  Chinese producers of such equipment are now required to apply for export licenses and show
*22:43.740- 22:48.520* :  that they're not going to someone who is likely to use them for military purposes.
*22:49.080- 22:53.660* :  Ukrainian volunteers and soldiers say the availability of parts has dropped
*22:53.740- 22:57.460* :  and they fear that the situation may worsen over time.
*22:58.280- 23:02.720* :  Luba Shapovic heads Dignitas, one of the largest Ukrainian volunteer groups
*23:02.720- 23:04.840* :  supplying the military with drones.
*23:08.520- 23:12.860* :  The only change for now is that we're more active in buying whatever stock is left in
*23:12.860- 23:17.940* :  European warehouses. Dealers in Europe still have stock imported before the restrictions
*23:17.940- 23:23.880* :  came into force. At the moment, anything that's left in warehouses in Europe is being bought up.
*23:24.440- 23:26.820* :  What we'll be doing in the future is unclear.
*23:27.300- 23:31.140* :  Ms. Shapovic is particularly worried about the availability of parts
*23:31.140- 23:33.400* :  such as thermal imaging cameras.
*23:37.260- 23:40.020* :  Because days are getting shorter and nights longer,
*23:40.520- 23:43.740* :  this is definitely having an impact on supplies for our military
*23:44.320- 23:46.200* :  and how warfare is conducted in general.
*23:46.640- 23:49.040* :  Because we don't have as many thermal imaging drones,
*23:49.340- 23:51.460* :  our units are going blind at night.
*23:54.860- 24:00.880* :  This is just the latest hurdle facing volunteers procuring drones for both Russian and Ukrainian
*24:00.880- 24:06.060* :  armies. The world's largest commercial drone maker, the Chinese company DJI,
*24:06.060- 24:11.480* :  halted direct sales to both countries two months after the start or the full scale invasion
*24:11.480- 24:18.680* :  in February 2022. And it also banned its distributors across the globe from selling DJI products
*24:18.680- 24:21.100* :  to customers in Russia or Ukraine.
*24:21.480- 24:26.200* :  Also, there have been claims that the number of Chinese drones available for purchase in Europe
*24:26.200- 24:30.640* :  has declined, and Europe is where Ukraine volunteers often shop.
*24:31.320- 24:33.720* :  But it is not just Ukraine that is affected.
*24:34.220- 24:38.680* :  Referring to the curbs that came into force on the 1st of September, Russian newspaper
*24:38.680- 24:39.720* :  Kamerasan said,
*24:39.940- 24:45.060* :  The restrictions imposed by the Chinese authorities on drone exports have seriously complicated
*24:45.060- 24:48.580* :  their supplies to Russia and led to a shortage of some parts.
*24:48.940- 24:51.360* :  To minimize the impact of the Chinese restrictions,
*24:51.360- 24:55.020* :  Ukrainian volunteers have been busy looking for alternatives,
*24:55.660- 24:58.060* :  both in the West and in Ukraine itself.
*24:58.660- 25:03.300* :  For example, volunteer Anatoliy Polkovnikov says that a Ukrainian startup
*25:03.300- 25:06.040* :  is preparing to launch the production of drone motors.
*25:06.500- 25:08.920* :  He's also optimistic about the future.
*25:09.340- 25:17.040* :  I don't think these Chinese restrictions will have any impact on the general situation.
*25:18.100- 25:22.100* :  I have the feeling that long-term they will stimulate production in Ukraine.
*25:25.440- 25:29.720* :  Drones have been used in unprecedented numbers in the war in Ukraine,
*25:30.180- 25:33.980* :  and both of the worrying sides are heavily reliant on them.
*25:35.240- 25:38.920* :  That report was by BBC Monitoring's Russia editor, Vitaly Shevchenko.
*25:40.000- 25:44.560* :  And next to Switzerland, and an anti-immigrant party is, of course,
*25:44.560- 25:47.600* :  to come out on top in the Swiss Parliamentary Election.
*25:48.080- 25:51.220* :  Exit Pol suggests a victory for the Swiss People's Party.
*25:51.700- 25:53.180* :  Image in folks reports from Geneva.
*25:53.800- 25:58.140* :  Opinion Poles had predicted gains for the right and losses for the Greens,
*25:58.220- 26:02.980* :  but the projected increasing vote share for the right wing Swiss People's Party
*26:03.560- 26:07.940* :  up 3.4% on the last elections is a surprise.
*26:08.060- 26:12.140* :  The Social Democrats on the left have also made modest gains,
*26:12.140- 26:14.900* :  but the big loser is the Green Party.
*26:15.540- 26:19.800* :  Although Swiss voters repeatedly say they are worried about climate change,
*26:19.820- 26:24.260* :  they are also concerned about immigration and the cost of living,
*26:24.880- 26:27.760* :  things the People's Party campaigned hard on.
*26:28.440- 26:30.160* :  Image in folks in Switzerland there.
*26:31.120- 26:33.980* :  Tax violations and irregular land use.
*26:34.260- 26:39.800* :  Those are the accusations leveled against the Taiwanese electronics maker Foxconn in China,
*26:40.200- 26:42.660* :  where the company makes products for amongst others, Apple.
*26:42.720- 26:46.000* :  And it employs hundreds of thousands of workers across China.
*26:46.600- 26:49.160* :  The investigation could also have political implications.
*26:49.900- 26:52.540* :  I asked Asia-Pacific regional editor Mickey Bristo,
*26:52.820- 26:54.580* :  how important the company Foxconn is.
*26:55.140- 26:58.160* :  This would be a major deal if it was just an economic story,
*26:58.160- 27:00.700* :  because we're talking about a company Foxconn,
*27:00.960- 27:05.040* :  which makes, like it's one of the world's biggest makers of electronic products,
*27:05.040- 27:07.740* :  it means it makes all kinds of things for Apple,
*27:07.740- 27:12.300* :  the big US firm, and another company is too in China and across the world.
*27:12.300- 27:14.620* :  It employs hundreds of thousands of people.
*27:15.160- 27:19.420* :  So these reports that it's been investigated in four Chinese provinces
*27:19.420- 27:23.840* :  for potential tax abuses and land use violations
*27:23.980- 27:27.560* :  will be serious enough just as a bigger story,
*27:27.560- 27:30.160* :  but there's something a little bit more as well here.
*27:30.880- 27:34.800* :  Foxconn is a Taiwanese company operating in mainland China.
*27:34.800- 27:39.800* :  That's complicated because China believes Taiwan is a part of its own territory.
*27:40.340- 27:45.040* :  So there's a connection there which allows China to subtly and sometimes,
*27:45.040- 27:49.220* :  not so subtly exert pressure on Taiwanese businesses
*27:49.900- 27:52.340* :  to try and change events in Taiwan itself.
*27:52.880- 27:57.120* :  And that is significant now because of the founder of Foxconn,
*27:57.720- 28:01.240* :  wanting to stand in next year's Taiwanese presidential election, isn't it?
*28:01.420- 28:02.740* :  Indeed, that's exactly the case.
*28:02.740- 28:07.360* :  Terry Goh, founder of Foxconn, has decided he wants to stand as an independent
*28:07.360- 28:12.740* :  candidate in Taiwan's next presidential election, which takes place in January.
*28:13.340- 28:20.340* :  So China obviously can exert some influence through Terry Goh,
*28:20.340- 28:22.140* :  through Foxconn in Taiwan.
*28:22.240- 28:24.060* :  And it's not just me that saying that.
*28:24.420- 28:29.020* :  Chinese state-run media which broke this story, it quotes an academic saying that
*28:29.020- 28:34.240* :  Foxconn should actively contribute to promoting peaceful cross-states relations.
*28:34.580- 28:39.000* :  That means actively promote good relations between Taiwan and China.
*28:39.840- 28:43.080* :  It's a delicate tightrope walk that all candidates
*28:43.080- 28:45.720* :  are presidential elections in Taiwan tread.
*28:46.520- 28:52.520* :  China and China's desire to have Taiwan unite with the mainland is the biggest issue.
*28:52.980- 28:56.080* :  And all of them, to some degree, have to cope with that question.
*28:56.580- 29:01.120* :  And somebody like Terry Goh who's got business interests, massive business interests in China,
*29:01.120- 29:03.960* :  that tightrope walk is even more precarious.
*29:04.600- 29:05.120* :  Mickey Brister.
*29:06.340- 29:10.340* :  North Korea is, for all intents and purposes, a closed country.
*29:10.620- 29:14.340* :  Very few people get in and almost no North Koreans can get out.
*29:14.340- 29:18.920* :  But some do manage to leave, to escape King Jong Un's regime.
*29:19.600- 29:23.000* :  It is a hazardous journey which normally involves a network of contacts,
*29:23.000- 29:25.280* :  at a route out via China.
*29:26.100- 29:30.380* :  There's a new documentary featuring footage shot by people who've managed to get out.
*29:30.720- 29:32.380* :  It's called Beyond Utopia.
*29:35.880- 29:40.880* :  Imagine waking up one day and realizing that you're on a completely different plan.
*29:41.220- 29:46.760* :  And everything you learn towards life and the heroes you were actually in monster's films.
*29:48.180- 29:53.840* :  Su Mi-Terry is a former director for Korea at the U.S. National Security Council.
*29:54.280- 29:56.100* :  And is the co-producer of this film.
*29:56.100- 29:59.020* :  She told Julian Warwicka more about the main protagonist.
*29:59.760- 30:03.140* :  What's going on is a mother who has arrived in South Korea.
*30:03.140- 30:06.640* :  She's a North Korean defector who has been living in South Korea for some time.
*30:06.640- 30:11.660* :  And after learning about freedom, and of course she wants to get her son
*30:12.040- 30:14.540* :  who's left in North Korea, out of North Korea.
*30:14.540- 30:20.960* :  So the film tells her story, her quest, and her desperate desire to get her son out.
*30:21.100- 30:25.280* :  People will have seen documentaries about the way the country is run and the suffering
*30:25.280- 30:28.480* :  that ordinary people endure as a result of living there.
*30:28.740- 30:31.300* :  What do you think is different about what you're saying here?
*30:31.460- 30:37.360* :  I think people get to get a real-time sense of what happens when North Koreans flee.
*30:37.360- 30:43.100* :  We see their journey from the beginning and we get to go on that journey with them once they flee.
*30:43.100- 30:46.340* :  This is why you want to feel the tension when you're watching the movie
*30:46.540- 30:47.780* :  because you don't know what's going to happen.
*30:47.780- 30:49.800* :  You're experiencing it with them.
*30:49.880- 30:53.660* :  People might be under the impression that if you are fortunate enough
*30:53.660- 30:57.700* :  to get across that river that borders North Korea and China,
*30:58.040- 31:00.120* :  the problems are still huge, aren't they?
*31:00.200- 31:03.320* :  Just because you arrive in China, it doesn't mean anything.
*31:03.320- 31:04.680* :  You can be caught.
*31:04.680- 31:08.220* :  The Chinese government's policy is to send North Koreans back.
*31:08.660- 31:10.540* :  So you have to run from them.
*31:10.540- 31:12.760* :  You have 3,000 mile journey.
*31:13.080- 31:17.960* :  So you are constantly fleeing from Chinese security services, North Korean security services.
*31:17.960- 31:21.380* :  So to get to South Korea and to get to freedom,
*31:21.380- 31:24.000* :  it's a very treacherous and long journey.
*31:24.320- 31:30.160* :  And this is where the pastor calls upon a sort of network of people who he knows he can trust
*31:30.220- 31:31.760* :  along that journey, doesn't he?
*31:31.940- 31:38.300* :  Yes, it's a huge underground network of people that helps or some are brokers,
*31:38.300- 31:42.740* :  some are driven by mission to help, but this is a business for them.
*31:42.880- 31:46.860* :  But for this one family, the rural family that's in the film,
*31:46.860- 31:51.700* :  some 50 brokers were used to just help this one particular family escape.
*31:51.940- 31:53.520* :  I'd some of them make money out of doing that.
*31:53.740- 31:56.100* :  Yes, this is business for many of them,
*31:56.240- 32:00.300* :  but it's also risk for them because if they are caught helping these North Koreans,
*32:00.520- 32:02.460* :  they will be also sent to prison.
*32:02.680- 32:05.140* :  You're a former US national security expert.
*32:05.140- 32:08.700* :  I wonder what that level of expertise has brought to this film,
*32:08.700- 32:12.260* :  in terms of the role that you've had here, namely as a co-producer.
*32:12.400- 32:17.060* :  Even as a national security expert, and I worked at the CIA over a decade as an North Korea expert,
*32:17.220- 32:19.040* :  there were many things that were new to me.
*32:19.160- 32:23.460* :  For example, I've debriefed defectors often after they arrive in South Korea,
*32:23.720- 32:25.120* :  and then I hear about it.
*32:25.120- 32:27.840* :  So I understood theoretically, this is what one does.
*32:27.840- 32:31.620* :  They go through this jungle and this kind of mountain and this kind of treacherous journey.
*32:31.620- 32:35.200* :  It is quite another thing for me to see it with my own eyes.
*32:35.200- 32:37.740* :  How it happens as it was happening.
*32:37.840- 32:42.180* :  And is the North Korean government making it ever harder for people to get out at all?
*32:42.380- 32:46.220* :  Kim Jong-un, regime recently has really cracked down on this,
*32:46.340- 32:50.580* :  because I think what the regime is most worried about is the people.
*32:50.580- 32:54.120* :  People fleeing, also getting information getting into North Korea,
*32:54.120- 32:59.500* :  even more so than let's say US and South Korean governments or military,
*32:59.500- 33:01.560* :  and whatever threat they can repose.
*33:01.600- 33:03.980* :  Kim Jong-un is most worried about his own people.
*33:04.580- 33:08.980* :  Su Mi Terry, a former director for Korea at the US National Security Council,
*33:08.980- 33:11.840* :  and the co-producer of the film, Beyond Utopia.
*33:14.280- 33:15.600* :  And that's all from us for now,
*33:15.600- 33:18.520* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:18.800- 33:20.200* :  If you want to comment on this podcast,
