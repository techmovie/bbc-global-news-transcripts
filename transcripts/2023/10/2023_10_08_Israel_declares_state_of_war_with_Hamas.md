*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.860* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.060- 00:25.020* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Monday the 9th of October, these are our main stories.
*00:25.600- 00:31.160* :  More than 700 Israeli citizens are reported killed since the Hamas militant group launched a
*00:31.160- 00:37.220* :  huge offensive from Gaza on Saturday. My country has suffered hundreds of fatalities.
*00:37.220- 00:46.320* :  This is Israel's 9-11. We will not let the world forget the atrocities our country suffered.
*00:46.320- 00:52.840* :  Israel's military responds by pummeling the Gaza Strip Palestinians say more than 400 people have died.
*00:53.180- 00:56.900* :  Everywhere you're going Gaza, you'll see, you know, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see,
*00:56.900- 01:02.880* :  building, collapsing. So you'll feel that you could be next. This bomb could be on the cover of your
*01:02.880- 01:08.260* :  whole, or something like that. The US is sending support to Israel, including its most advanced
*01:08.260- 01:16.960* :  aircraft carrier group. Also in this podcast, the number of confirmed victims of Afghanistan's latest
*01:16.960- 01:23.440* :  earthquake passes 1,000, and the Welsh Museum that's missing almost 2,000 items.
*01:26.960- 01:31.480* :  In the past few hours have been getting more details about the people killed in southern Israel
*01:31.480- 01:36.980* :  on Saturday by gunmen belonging to the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
*01:37.380- 01:42.780* :  Israeli media say that around 700 people died in the unprecedented assault after the militants
*01:42.780- 01:49.060* :  broke through the barrier surrounding the Gaza Strip. We now know that more than 250 of those killed
*01:49.060- 01:54.600* :  were at a music festival. The BBC's Joe Floto is in Jerusalem. The Zaka organisation,
*01:54.600- 02:01.840* :  which the group of volunteers, they've recovered more than 250 bodies from the site of that music
*02:01.840- 02:09.500* :  festival, and bodies still remain there. So that is a huge total of people who have been killed,
*02:09.560- 02:16.400* :  but it won't come as a shock, because we know just how bad that attack was, and we've been hearing
*02:16.400- 02:21.000* :  testimony from people who survived that attack that said the shooting carried on for hours,
*02:21.760- 02:27.400* :  that there were gunmen approaching the revolution, the festival goers on both sides, and they chased
*02:27.440- 02:33.960* :  them through the countryside and into the forests and back to their cars and established roadblocks.
*02:34.340- 02:40.080* :  And we've seen pictures today of the remains of those cars burnt out, shot up, and there were
*02:40.080- 02:46.700* :  bodies lying in the streets in the surrounding areas. Joe Floto in Jerusalem, the Israeli government
*02:46.700- 02:52.700* :  says at least 100 people have been taken hostage. The army is still battling to regain control of
*02:52.700- 02:58.880* :  some areas. In Gaza, Israel's military response has intensified Palestinian health officials say
*02:58.880- 03:04.640* :  there have been more than 400 deaths so far, and more than 2,000 injuries. Our correspondent,
*03:04.640- 03:10.340* :  Yolanda Nell, is in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. You may find parts of her report
*03:10.340- 03:16.320* :  upsetting. Through the day, southern Israel has seen more gunfights, as security forces have tried
*03:16.320- 03:22.220* :  to track down Palestinian militants still at large and free hostages. Close to Ashkelon,
*03:22.220- 03:28.060* :  there were dramatic scenes, as Israeli soldiers pursued gunmen from Gaza driving a stolen car,
*03:28.060- 03:33.960* :  and killed them on the roadside. But many are still missing, their fates are known. There's
*03:33.960- 03:38.860* :  now huge concern for the dozens of Israelis, including women and children, believed to have been
*03:38.860- 03:44.740* :  taken back to Gaza as hostages by Palestinian militant groups. Renanar lives in a caboot,
*03:44.740- 03:49.640* :  a small community near Gaza. She said her sons were taken from their beds.
*03:50.520- 03:55.980* :  I was on the phone with my youngest, I wasn't hung at the time, and all I could hear is him begging
*03:55.980- 04:03.140* :  for not to take him because he's too young, and making you all mothers of all places in the world
*04:04.660- 04:09.560* :  helped me find my sons and return them home. They are just kids.
*04:10.560- 04:16.440* :  Israel's military has hit the Gaza Strip hard, striking more than 450 targets, which it said
*04:16.440- 04:21.920* :  were mostly associated with her mass. Its chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari,
*04:21.920- 04:29.760* :  warned it would be a long campaign. The days ahead will be long and difficult. We have paid
*04:29.760- 04:38.420* :  a heavy price, but we will restore security to the people of Israel. Let me repeat, we will
*04:38.420- 04:47.260* :  store security to the people of Israel. Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari ending that report by
*04:47.260- 04:53.900* :  Eoland now. Earlier, I got an update on developments on the ground from our respondent John Donerson
*04:53.900- 04:59.720* :  in Jerusalem. We've got reserves being caught up in the tens of thousands, and there is a huge
*04:59.720- 05:09.580* :  movement of force towards the Gaza border. Given the surprise nature of this assault by her mass,
*05:10.100- 05:17.200* :  I do think it could be several days before we see the full weight of Israel's response. They're
*05:17.200- 05:21.640* :  going to be drawing up plans, but I think it is almost inevitable that there is going to be some
*05:21.640- 05:26.380* :  sort of ground operation, and it's for that reason that so many troops are being pulled in from
*05:26.380- 05:31.220* :  all across the country, although we did actually meet a mother of a soldier just when I was at the
*05:31.220- 05:36.420* :  airport coming into Israel today, and she said her son had been diverted to go down to the Gaza
*05:37.120- 05:41.000* :  border. Gaza, he's in the military, but he then been told to go back to where he'd been stationed
*05:41.420- 05:45.160* :  in the north because of fears that tensions are rising up there on the border with Lebanon too.
*05:45.920- 05:51.380* :  Is that description of the past 48 hours being among the darkest in Israel's history fair?
*05:51.720- 05:58.740* :  It absolutely is. I mean, this is a traumatic moment for Israel. There's just been nothing like it.
*05:58.740- 06:05.260* :  When you look at that figure, which is now being estimated at 700 Israelis killed in some Israeli
*06:05.260- 06:10.220* :  media outlets, I was just looking back at some of the previous conflicts between Hamas and Gaza
*06:10.700- 06:20.440* :  the 2008-2009 conflict. 13 Israelis killed. 2012-6 Israelis killed. 2014-73 Israelis killed.
*06:20.900- 06:25.180* :  We're looking at 700 here, and 100 hostages taken to.
*06:25.840- 06:32.460* :  John Donerson in Jerusalem. Israeli warplanes continued to bombard Gaza in retaliation force
*06:32.460- 06:37.820* :  at a day's attack. Video images show many buildings being blown up and large-scale destruction.
*06:37.820- 06:42.200* :  Shops are closed. The streets are empty. The city is said to be like a ghost town.
*06:42.200- 06:47.040* :  Health officials say more than 400 people have been killed so far, many of them civilians.
*06:47.040- 06:52.920* :  And Palestinians are now living in fear of their lives. One aid worker likened a major hospital
*06:52.920- 06:59.140* :  in Gaza City to a slaughterhouse. Dr. Khamis Alessi, who's a consultant, said the situation was
*06:59.140- 07:05.380* :  unbearable. You can hear the bombardment and the shelling from every corner. Everywhere you're going
*07:05.380- 07:11.100* :  Gaza, you'll see funeral, you'll see death, you'll see building collapsing. It's just like you're
*07:11.100- 07:16.640* :  watching a movie about the end of life on the earth. I haven't slept for a second, 10 days
*07:16.660- 07:21.540* :  the day because you cannot just close your eye, the kids are crying, screaming, so you'll feel
*07:21.540- 07:26.760* :  that you could be next. I mean, this bomb could be on top of your home, on top of your apartment.
*07:27.320- 07:30.980* :  We got the latest from our reporter in Gaza, Rusty Abu Aluf.
*07:31.340- 07:36.160* :  It has been very intense fighting throughout the day, hundreds of targets were hit by
*07:36.160- 07:41.980* :  the Israelis. The idea I've said they have targeted 800 Hamas targets. The latest one was about
*07:41.980- 07:46.960* :  like a hundred meters from our office here in downtown. It scored the production bank,
*07:46.960- 07:53.120* :  it's a bank set up by Hamas. It's a three-four story building completely a destroyed living
*07:53.120- 07:58.480* :  to the ground, closing the main street of the Umar al Muhtar street. This is the main street in
*07:58.480- 08:04.900* :  downtown Gaza. It's completely blocked by the tibberies of this building. Here in Gaza,
*08:04.900- 08:10.780* :  night always carry painful memories for the people when there is escalation with Israel because
*08:11.180- 08:18.540* :  Israel will escalate the airstrikes in Gaza as they started retaliation for the Hamas massive
*08:18.540- 08:24.400* :  attack on the border and fired thousands of rockets yesterday. Since last night, Israel have been
*08:24.400- 08:31.420* :  targeting many installations for Hamas buildings, banks, two or three mosques were destroyed in
*08:31.420- 08:37.880* :  southern Gaza. Many, many targets for Hamas has been destroyed. When we talk about the second day
*08:37.880- 08:43.380* :  of this fighting, the image here today is completely different from yesterday. Yesterday we
*08:43.380- 08:48.740* :  have seen people in the streets celebrating what they said that Hamas was revinging from Israel
*08:48.740- 08:54.420* :  for continuous Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people. As some of the people
*08:54.420- 08:59.700* :  told me in the street, today is completely a different image. Today is an image of destruction
*08:59.700- 09:06.340* :  everywhere. Even downtown Gaza was most of the streets were blocked by buildings knocked down
*09:06.340- 09:12.840* :  by the Israelis completely destroyed living to the ground. Tonight, Israeli drones, Israeli fighter
*09:12.840- 09:18.320* :  rockets are still flying over Gaza and people are expecting another night of fighting.
*09:19.020- 09:24.680* :  Rusty Abu Aluf in Gaza. Israeli commentators are calling the events since Saturday,
*09:24.680- 09:30.180* :  their 9-11, their Pearl Harbor. In other words, a sense of the nation attacked in a way
*09:30.660- 09:35.620* :  that has left a deep feeling of vulnerability and trauma. What's going to be the government's
*09:35.620- 09:41.180* :  response to that? Tim Frank spoke to Danny Dunon, a member of the Knesset for the governing
*09:41.180- 09:47.180* :  liquid party. There are still terrorists in our territories. We are fighting and we are
*09:47.180- 09:52.660* :  clearing the areas in the community, in the southern border with Gaza. And at the same time,
*09:52.660- 09:57.600* :  we are preparing to launch our first bike. And it will be a painful one, to teach a lesson
*09:57.600- 10:03.520* :  the leadership of Hamas about what the barbaric acts the community yesterday. We will use all of our
*10:03.520- 10:08.540* :  might to restore security and safety to the people of Israel. What do you think security and
*10:08.540- 10:14.340* :  safety looks like? We have to eliminate Hamas period. It will not be easy, but that is the only
*10:14.340- 10:19.180* :  solution. We left Gaza 18 years ago. You don't have any Jewish community in Gaza today. Don't
*10:19.180- 10:24.500* :  have any so-called occupation in Gaza today. And still, we have seen what happened in Gaza.
*10:24.720- 10:30.300* :  We feel for the people of Gaza. We have nothing against the civilian in Gaza. And we call them today
*10:30.300- 10:36.400* :  to move, not to stay next to the headquarters of Hamas. We are trying to use them as human shields.
*10:36.400- 10:41.860* :  We will hand them down. We will find them. And we will hope that it will be short, but we are ready
*10:41.860- 10:47.920* :  for our long operation. I can understand it's a very simple aspiration to get rid of Hamas.
*10:48.200- 10:54.840* :  The problem is you have got a pretty powerful militant organization in the Gaza Strip, which is
*10:54.840- 11:01.200* :  one of the most densely populated areas on Earth, more than two million people, in a very small
*11:01.200- 11:08.260* :  strip of land. Saying that you want to eradicate Hamas, I just wonder what the territory of the
*11:08.260- 11:15.000* :  Gaza Strip is going to look like. If you get to the point where you say, right, there are no more
*11:15.000- 11:21.000* :  people from Hamas inside Gaza. I mean, the place will be reduced to rubble, weren't it?
*11:21.080- 11:26.400* :  That is not our intention. You're right. Gaza will not look the same, but we have no other options.
*11:26.400- 11:32.480* :  To be blamed is Hamas and not Israel. It was an unprovoked brutal attack against our communities.
*11:32.480- 11:37.160* :  That's why we have to take action. And we will do what everybody is necessary. If they're hiding
*11:37.160- 11:41.740* :  in hospitals, we should go into the hospital. If they're fighting in the tunnels, we should find
*11:41.740- 11:46.560* :  them and kill them in the tunnels. But you are aware, of course, that I mean, when you say that
*11:46.560- 11:51.640* :  you're just hunting Hamas and that you're asking the civilians to move away from Hamas, it is
*11:52.000- 11:58.960* :  near on impossible for those civilians of Gaza to find safe harbor anywhere. I mean,
*11:58.960- 12:05.520* :  your intention not to harm civilians and yet your desire to degrade Hamas to the point where it
*12:05.520- 12:11.680* :  cannot operate. The two cannot sit together, can they? We will not get into the technical aspects,
*12:11.680- 12:17.000* :  but also in the past we always did our best to minimize the casualties of the civilians.
*12:17.220- 12:23.100* :  And those casualties have always in the past been vast. And we will continue to do our best.
*12:23.140- 12:27.780* :  And I think also in the future, we will send the messages to the people in Gaza.
*12:27.780- 12:32.240* :  They still can move to different locations, different neighborhoods. They should not be around
*12:32.240- 12:36.660* :  the Hamas militant. We know exactly where they are hiding. They also know where they are hiding.
*12:36.660- 12:42.980* :  And I would advise them to use the next few hours to move. I look at the end game. There is no
*12:42.980- 12:48.520* :  place for a ceasefire with terrorist organization. There is no game for negotiations now. After
*12:48.520- 12:54.120* :  what happened yesterday, I think today you have a consensus among Israelis that we have no choice,
*12:54.120- 13:00.900* :  we have to do that now. May I ask what you say to those who say that although you're talking about
*13:00.900- 13:09.080* :  consensus, the very reason that Hamas attacked when it did is because they have seen an Israel that
*13:09.080- 13:16.780* :  has become divided, driven with hate in the words of one Israeli commentator who is reading today.
*13:17.520- 13:23.880* :  And therefore weakened because of the government that your Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*13:24.480- 13:30.260* :  has led and that you have had people refusing or considering refusing to serve because they
*13:30.260- 13:37.040* :  feel such disgust at what this government is doing. And that that is what has undermined Israel's
*13:37.260- 13:42.100* :  strength. That is ridiculous. First of all, don't look for reasoning when you deal with a terrorist
*13:42.100- 13:48.160* :  organization. In the same way you cannot find reasoning for 9-11 or for ISIS. When you deal with
*13:48.160- 13:54.160* :  barbaric radical Muslims, don't look for logic. Second, today we are united. You don't have
*13:54.160- 13:59.380* :  left or right or positional coalition. We are crying. We are in pain. But also we find
*13:59.380- 14:03.120* :  the strength and to fight back. That exactly what will happen in the next few days.
*14:03.880- 14:08.980* :  Member of the Israeli Knesset, Danny Danon speaking to the BBC's Tim Franks.
*14:09.960- 14:15.260* :  Any ground offensive by the army will be made all more difficult by the Israeli hostages being
*14:15.260- 14:21.060* :  held in Gaza. I asked our security correspondent Frank Gardner what can be done about them.
*14:21.060- 14:26.420* :  This isn't easy because ideally if it was just one or two probably being held in one location,
*14:26.420- 14:30.800* :  Israel would plan a special forces raid. They're very good at this. They've got their Syrah,
*14:30.800- 14:34.680* :  Matt Kahl, a sort of equivalent of Delta Force, SAS to go in,
*14:35.800- 14:41.500* :  they do this pretty efficiently. But going into Gaza is fraught with difficulties because
*14:42.160- 14:46.040* :  almost certainly Hamas will have distributed the hostages in several different locations,
*14:46.100- 14:52.140* :  underground insellers with no comms. They'll stay offline and they will be in areas that are heavily
*14:52.140- 14:57.520* :  populated. There's no chance of approaching quietly on foot, undetected, which leaves negotiations.
*14:58.060- 15:02.960* :  How long did it take for Israel to get Gilad Shalit back? He was kidnapped in 2006
*15:02.960- 15:08.980* :  in a cross-border raid by Hamas. He wasn't released until five years later. And it took the release
*15:08.980- 15:13.140* :  of Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners to secure his release. So it's going to be a really
*15:13.140- 15:18.740* :  thorny one, that. And longer term, what the Netanyahu government, which is particularly hard line,
*15:18.740- 15:24.780* :  will want to do, is impress upon Hamas that an action such as it has undertaken this weekend
*15:25.540- 15:30.100* :  comes with such an unbearable cost that they shouldn't do it again. And unfortunately it's
*15:30.100- 15:33.560* :  the Palestinian people who are going to pay the bulk of it. I mean, the Israelis really turned
*15:33.560- 15:39.960* :  off the electricity, cutting off fuel. But I think the more pragmatic elements of Israeli society
*15:40.660- 15:46.020* :  will want to see in the long run a continuation of the search for a lasting peace solution,
*15:46.060- 15:51.540* :  one that actually gives the Palestinians a functioning contingent state, not one that is absolutely
*15:51.540- 15:56.800* :  pockmarked with settlements. The less pragmatic elements, though, of the Netanyahu government,
*15:56.800- 16:02.540* :  might well be urging the Israeli defense forces to go all into Gaza. I'm glad you mentioned that
*16:02.560- 16:07.100* :  because that is not unrelated to the hostage issue. You're absolutely right. And I think there are
*16:07.100- 16:12.460* :  signs already that Israeli armor is starting to move towards Gaza. This is not a silver bullet to
*16:12.460- 16:17.340* :  deal with it. It may make hardliners and people like Iter Mar Ben-Gavir, the security minister,
*16:17.780- 16:20.700* :  maybe it may give them a nice warm fuzzy feeling that they're striking back.
*16:20.700- 16:26.680* :  It's going to result in horrendous casualties on both sides. You've got 2.3 million Palestinians
*16:26.680- 16:31.460* :  in that area. Their weapons are not as powerful as the Israeli defense forces, but my goodness,
*16:31.460- 16:35.460* :  this is going to be costly. There's going to be a very high death toll if that happens.
*16:35.860- 16:39.340* :  One last question, Frank. How did Israel not see this coming?
*16:39.780- 16:44.740* :  I've been racking my brains on this one and talking to Israelis about it. And I think many
*16:44.740- 16:49.180* :  Israelis are asking the same questions in quite an angry tone from their own government and military
*16:49.180- 16:53.380* :  leaders. I think the answer is that there might well have been people pretty low down the
*16:53.380- 16:58.000* :  pecking order who did see it coming. So I can only imagine that warnings that were given that
*16:58.000- 17:02.560* :  something is brewing were ignored further up the chain. That somebody said, there's always
*17:02.560- 17:07.020* :  trouble from coming from Gaza. We're used to it. We've got this. And of course, don't forget this
*17:07.020- 17:12.260* :  took place on one of the holiest days in the Jewish calendar, a day of celebration coming at the end
*17:12.260- 17:16.880* :  of the festival of Sakot, which comes to the end of the kind of Jewish biblical year of reading of
*17:16.880- 17:22.580* :  the Torah. And Israel's God was down. If that sounds familiar, it happened 50 years ago at Yon Kippur.
*17:23.560- 17:29.640* :  The BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner, Iran has praised Hamas for carrying out the attack
*17:29.640- 17:35.160* :  on Israel. President Ibrahim Reisi called on other Muslim countries to join the conflict against
*17:35.160- 17:41.000* :  Israel. The militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, launched an artillery attack into
*17:41.000- 17:47.000* :  Israel from Lebanon on Sunday morning. Speaking to supporters in Beirut, Hezbollah senior official
*17:47.000- 17:56.860* :  Hashem Safi-Addin offered support for Hamas in Gaza. We salute all our beloved Palestinian
*17:56.860- 18:02.360* :  resistance factions in Palestine, no matter who they belong to. We tell them that the nation is
*18:02.360- 18:09.560* :  with you. Our hearts, minds, souls, our history, our guns and rockets, and all that we have is with
*18:09.560- 18:15.280* :  you. Because we are the resistance that was founded originally for you and for Palestine and
*18:15.280- 18:21.300* :  Jerusalem. Israel returned fire, injuring several people around the town of Kafachibar in Lebanon
*18:21.300- 18:26.480* :  from where our Middle East correspondent Quentin Somerville reports. The Israeli military
*18:26.480- 18:32.820* :  post that sits atop a hillside overlooking the town of Kafachibar appeared undamaged by the Hezbollah
*18:32.820- 18:38.400* :  attack. The Iranian-backed group, which fired artillery and rockets at the base and two other
*18:38.400- 18:44.780* :  sites, has considerable firepower at its disposal. But this was a contained assault, a warning shot.
*18:45.680- 18:51.360* :  Israel returned fire, striking olive groves around Kafachibar. Later in the day, further strikes
*18:51.360- 18:56.100* :  left several locals injured. They are being treated in hospital, the Lebanese army said.
*18:56.680- 19:02.600* :  Hezbollah said today's attack was an act of solidarity with Palestinians. Like Hamas and Iran,
*19:02.600- 19:07.900* :  it is committed to Israel's destruction. A senior official from the group said it would not
*19:07.900- 19:14.180* :  remain neutral in any war and warn the United States and Israel to stop or face a wider regional
*19:14.180- 19:19.240* :  conflict. Hezbollah is the dominant militant group in Lebanon, but there are many in the country
*19:19.240- 19:24.400* :  that oppose it. Still suffering from political paralysis, there is no president and a shattering
*19:24.400- 19:30.580* :  economic crisis, Lebanon is poorly placed to face another crisis. Quentin Somerville.
*19:33.220- 19:38.880* :  Still to come in the global news podcast. The real winners are the right-wing populists and that
*19:38.880- 19:45.880* :  would include the free voters, a relatively new party and the AFD are the far right party, very
*19:45.880- 19:50.460* :  controversial. We hear about the rise of the right in Germany's regional elections.
*19:55.060- 19:59.640* :  Thousands of people in Western Afghanistan are spending a second night in the open
*19:59.640- 20:05.340* :  after a strong earthquake on Saturday, reduced entire villages to rubble. There has been confusion
*20:05.340- 20:11.040* :  about the number of dead, with Taliban officials apologizing for an earlier assessment that more than
*20:11.040- 20:17.360* :  2000 people had died. The United Nations humanitarian agency says more than 1,000 have been killed
*20:17.360- 20:23.080* :  and more than 500 are still missing. Here's the BBC's South Asia correspondent, Yogy Talimai.
*20:23.520- 20:28.700* :  More than a dozen villages in the Harath province have been virtually flattened. An area that was
*20:28.700- 20:34.160* :  earlier dotted with small, single-story mud homes has been reduced to piles of brown rubble.
*20:34.980- 20:41.360* :  Zindajan District, a rural area roughly 25 miles from Harath city, was the epicenter of the earthquake.
*20:41.400- 20:48.400* :  We came home and saw there was nothing left, everything had turned to mud.
*20:48.820- 20:54.720* :  We started to dig with shovels and whatever we had to rescue women and children from the rubble.
*20:55.340- 21:00.620* :  One resident, Naked Mohammed, said. Villagers have been digging mass graves to bury the dead.
*21:01.380- 21:06.820* :  For a people reeling under a severe crisis of hunger caused by years of war and drought,
*21:07.400- 21:13.560* :  this is another devastating blow. With winter fast approaching, thousands of families are now without
*21:13.560- 21:19.860* :  shelter. Harath's main hospital, stretched thin even under normal circumstances, is struggling
*21:19.860- 21:26.120* :  to treat the injured. Eight agencies are trying to help. The Taliban government says survivors
*21:26.120- 21:32.760* :  urgently need food, drinking water, medicine, clothes and tents. Yogy Talimai.
*21:33.560- 21:38.620* :  Sunday was not a good day for the governing coalition of social democrats, greens and free
*21:38.620- 21:44.740* :  democrats in Germany, in two regional elections in Bavaria and Hess, all three parties did
*21:44.740- 21:49.840* :  worse than at the last election. Much attention was paid to right wing populist parties.
*21:49.840- 21:55.100* :  The AFD gained voters in both regions, while the free voters, who are part of the governing
*21:55.100- 22:00.900* :  coalition in Bavaria, also improved their share of the vote. I asked our correspondent in Germany,
*22:00.900- 22:06.760* :  Damien McGinnis, if the populists are celebrating. I think to be honest, Alex, any of the
*22:06.760- 22:11.840* :  rice of center parties are viewing today as a very good day for them. So what we're seeing in both
*22:11.840- 22:17.260* :  Hess and Bavaria is that the incumbent conservatives are likely able to stay in government,
*22:17.260- 22:21.360* :  say, leading the government with coalition partners, particularly in Hess, the conservatives
*22:21.360- 22:27.380* :  have done extremely well with a clear boost of almost 10%. The conservatives who lead Bavaria,
*22:27.380- 22:32.080* :  though, they've got a slight dip, but still it's the largest party. But the real winners, as you say,
*22:32.700- 22:38.240* :  are the right wing populists, and that would include the free voters, a relatively new party.
*22:38.760- 22:44.180* :  They've scored a very good result in Bavaria. They would be described as hard right populists,
*22:44.180- 22:51.100* :  really. And the AFD are the far right party, very controversial. That's shocked a lot of people
*22:51.100- 22:57.820* :  here that in Bavaria, for example, combined the AFD vote and the free voter vote, you're basically
*22:57.820- 23:03.420* :  talking about almost a third of voters. So 30% of voters voted for one of those two parties.
*23:03.940- 23:09.200* :  And in Hess, where the free voters don't do very well, but you do have the AFD, they've got their
*23:09.200- 23:17.160* :  best result ever, and they came second. Was this fought on regional issues, or is this really a mid-telling
*23:17.160- 23:23.280* :  off for the federal government? Yeah, I think it really was voters giving all of Schultz's national
*23:23.280- 23:28.880* :  governments a bashing really, or three national governing parties have suffered in both regions.
*23:28.880- 23:33.620* :  And it's interesting, because on paper, if you look at the figures, Germany's not doing that badly.
*23:34.220- 23:37.420* :  Unemployment's very low. When you ask people in polls how they are doing
*23:37.420- 23:41.900* :  personally economically, people say not actually not that badly. When you ask them,
*23:41.900- 23:45.380* :  though, how the country is doing, how the future looks, the mood is terrible.
*23:46.020- 23:51.460* :  So I think there seems to be a lack of confidence in the government and a nervousness about
*23:51.460- 23:56.540* :  the future. And I think that's something we've seen in today's results. David McGinnis in Germany.
*23:57.580- 24:03.980* :  The National Museum of Wales has admitted it can't find nearly 2,000 items. Some of them,
*24:03.980- 24:08.280* :  thousands of years old, last month, the National Library of Wales,
*24:08.280- 24:13.840* :  said it had lost track of 1,200 items. This report from Tilari-Glin Jones in Cardiff.
*24:14.300- 24:19.460* :  The almost 2,000 items missing from Amgye, the Camry, the National Museum of Wales,
*24:19.960- 24:26.400* :  include a small flint tool dating back to around 7,000 BC, a sword and an axe from the Bronze Age,
*24:26.760- 24:31.680* :  and a bracelet and ring from Roman times. They may only represent a small proportion of the
*24:31.680- 24:36.100* :  collection, but Dr Cath Davis, the Director of Collections at the Museum, is concerned.
*24:36.300- 24:41.900* :  It does seem like a rather large number and it is, but I think we also need to put that within
*24:41.900- 24:48.060* :  the context of the 5.3 million objects that we care for at Amgye, the Camry.
*24:48.580- 24:53.280* :  The number of missing items came to light after a freedom of information request by BBC Wales,
*24:53.280- 24:58.520* :  and it's not thought that they've been stolen but rather mislaid. Opposition parties in Wales
*24:58.520- 25:02.840* :  have called for better care to be taken and for more money from the Welsh Government to help protect
*25:02.840- 25:07.660* :  national treasures. The Welsh Government say the management of the collections is up to the museum
*25:07.660- 25:15.040* :  itself. Tilari-Glin Jones in Cardiff. Now, let's return to our top story. Media reports from
*25:15.040- 25:21.120* :  Israel now say an estimated 700 people have been killed since Palestinian Hamas militants launched
*25:21.120- 25:26.700* :  a huge offensive on Saturday. An official statement puts the number of Israelis taken hostage
*25:26.700- 25:33.140* :  at more than 100. An Israeli military spokesman said that some Hamas forces remained on Israeli
*25:33.140- 25:39.700* :  soil nearly two days after the fighting began. As the military response intensifies, Israeli residents
*25:39.700- 25:45.240* :  are being evacuated from towns near the Gaza boundary. Speaking before, a United Nations
*25:45.240- 25:51.620* :  Urgent Security Council emergency meeting Gilad Erdan, the permanent representative of Israel
*25:51.620- 25:58.420* :  to the UN, had this response. The past days have been devastating for each and every Israeli.
*25:58.420- 26:05.300* :  Israel suffered an unprecedented attack, and the number of casualties is catastrophic.
*26:05.340- 26:12.240* :  My country has suffered hundreds of fatalities. This is Israel's 9-11.
*26:12.240- 26:20.860* :  And Israel will do everything to bring our sons and daughters back home. We will not let the world
*26:20.860- 26:27.740* :  forget the atrocities our country suffered. The number of Palestinians killed in the violence has
*26:27.740- 26:33.720* :  also continued to climb health officials in Gaza, same more than 400 people have died so far as
*26:33.720- 26:39.280* :  Israel launches more air strikes on the territory. The Israeli military has been warning people to
*26:39.280- 26:44.060* :  leave areas. It's about to attack, but many of the casualties are reportedly civilians,
*26:44.060- 26:50.480* :  people living in Gaza, which is densely populated, say, conditions a dire. The Palestinian Ambassador
*26:50.480- 26:56.040* :  to the UN, Riyadh Mansur, has said that there should be a peaceful solution to the conflict.
*26:56.580- 27:05.120* :  This is not a time to let Israel double down on its terrible choices. This is a time to tell Israel
*27:05.120- 27:13.520* :  it needs to change course. That there is a path to peace where neither Palestinians nor Israelis
*27:14.440- 27:19.140* :  are killed. The diplomatic community has been at pains to try to calm the situation.
*27:19.140- 27:25.900* :  On Sunday, the US pledged more support for Israel, including sending its newest and most advanced
*27:25.900- 27:31.840* :  aircraft carrier, as I heard from the BBC's North America correspondent Shingai Nyaka in Washington.
*27:32.460- 27:36.560* :  There's been significant movement in the last couple of hours in relation to
*27:37.140- 27:44.220* :  the US outlining the support that it had promised to Israel. The Pentagon has put out a statement.
*27:44.220- 27:50.080* :  It says describing this as an initial emergency military support, as you mentioned,
*27:50.080- 27:56.500* :  their aircraft carriers, as well as guided missile cruisers, guided missile destroyers that are
*27:56.500- 28:02.520* :  headed from Western Mediterranean to the Eastern Mediterranean, a journey of about a thousand miles.
*28:02.720- 28:08.460* :  The US has also said that it's going to increase its Air Force fighter aircraft that will be going
*28:08.460- 28:13.300* :  into bases in the Middle East, where they will be available for operations against Iran.
*28:13.300- 28:18.160* :  But I think what's significant here is that the Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin is saying
*28:18.160- 28:23.160* :  is that these are forces that the US maintains globally and that they're being deployed,
*28:23.160- 28:27.720* :  they're just as a deterrence posture, but clearly an escalation here.
*28:27.720- 28:33.580* :  And in terms of the specific support for Israel, the US say that it will deploy additional
*28:33.580- 28:39.320* :  equipment and resources, including munitions that is being airlifted to Israel. Some of that
*28:39.320- 28:45.540* :  will be arriving today, but over the next couple of days also there's an expectation that more
*28:45.540- 28:51.080* :  consignment will arrive. And condemnation of the violence at the United Nations.
*28:51.080- 28:57.420* :  Yes, the United Nations Secretary General earlier had expressed a specifically concern about
*28:57.420- 29:03.560* :  the welfare of the citizens, but the UN Secretary General specifically wants a de-escalation
*29:03.560- 29:09.300* :  of the situation, something that's not likely to happen now that the more weapons that are being
*29:09.500- 29:10.400* :  delivered to Israel.
*29:17.360- 29:22.440* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:22.440- 29:27.760* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
*29:27.760- 29:35.900* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x, formerly known,
*29:35.900- 29:43.240* :  as Twitter at Global NewsPod. This edition was mixed by Darcy Obrey and the producer was
*29:43.240- 29:49.080* :  Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritzon until next time. Goodbye.
