*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:17.260* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.260- 00:24.660* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 3rd of October, these are our main
*00:24.660- 00:30.320* :  stories. A 14 year old boy has been arrested in Thailand after a deadly shooting at a bank
*00:30.320- 00:35.780* :  cock shopping mall. In India police have raided the homes of several journalists linked to a
*00:35.780- 00:40.480* :  prominent news website that's been accused of receiving illegal funds from China.
*00:42.840- 00:48.780* :  Also in this podcast, Pope Francis has suggested that same sex couples could be blessed by the
*00:48.780- 00:53.600* :  Catholic Church in the future. In Australia votes have been cast early in a landmark
*00:53.600- 00:59.000* :  referendum which could result in a permanent body of indigenous people to advise parliament.
*00:59.020- 01:05.020* :  And we look at a novel way in which artificial intelligence is being used in the art world.
*01:05.020- 01:09.160* :  What is your favourite painting? It's hard for me to choose a favourite painting
*01:09.160- 01:13.680* :  among my artworks because each painting is dead to me in its own way. But if I have to choose one,
*01:13.760- 01:16.360* :  I think my painting called Stora Knight is one of my favourites.
*01:20.640- 01:25.520* :  First to Thailand where a 14 year old boy has been arrested on suspicion of carrying out a mass
*01:25.520- 01:31.120* :  shooting, the teenager was detained after a gunman opened fire at a luxury shopping mall in the
*01:31.120- 01:36.360* :  capital bank cock. As healthy stature correspondent Jonathan Haid joined me from bank cock,
*01:36.740- 01:41.920* :  shortly before we recorded this podcast. We're still seeing ambulances leaving this shopping mall
*01:41.920- 01:47.840* :  more than three hours after this shocking incident while we believe that the police are still inside
*01:47.840- 01:53.100* :  with the 14 year old boy that they apprehended and who they say carried out the shooting.
*01:53.580- 01:58.800* :  We started in the late afternoon when this mall, as it pretty much always is, would have been very
*01:58.800- 02:04.760* :  crowded. I mean it's an exceptionally popular mall in bank cock and people had multiple gunshots
*02:04.760- 02:09.180* :  on the lower floors. Some of them went for the exits. People were seeing streaming out of the
*02:09.180- 02:15.540* :  exits in panic. Others went to hide inside stores barricading themselves in until the police
*02:15.540- 02:22.300* :  could come. The police have released a video showing them confronting the young shooter. He
*02:22.300- 02:25.980* :  went down on his knees. He was carrying a handgun and then surrendered quite quickly to them.
*02:26.720- 02:31.900* :  And they are now trying to ascertain what his motives could possibly be for carrying out such
*02:31.900- 02:36.920* :  an attack. I mean Sam Paragun sometimes says it is the most visited spot in Asia, pops up on
*02:36.920- 02:42.840* :  people's social media feeds. It's visited by most tourists who come to this city. So it's a very
*02:42.840- 02:50.120* :  high profile location. Gun crimes like this are relatively uncommon in Thailand. There are a lot
*02:50.120- 02:54.340* :  of small-scale gun crimes. There's quite a lot of gun ownership. There have been in recent years
*02:54.340- 02:59.820* :  a couple of very shocking large-scale shootings outside bank cock but nothing like this
*02:59.820- 03:05.680* :  rice in the very heart of the capital. Jonathan Head in Bangkok. In Delhi,
*03:05.680- 03:10.980* :  Indian police have raided the homes of several prominent journalist and authors in connection with
*03:10.980- 03:16.660* :  an investigation into the funding of news website NewsClick. Critics say the operation in the
*03:16.660- 03:22.460* :  country's capital is an attack on press freedom. I got the latest from the BBC's South Asia Regional
*03:22.460- 03:28.720* :  Editor and Barusan Eferajan. This morning many journalists have tweeted saying that their houses
*03:28.720- 03:34.440* :  were being raided as some of these journalists were connected with the news website called
*03:34.440- 03:42.900* :  NewsClick.n. It is described as a left-leaning website and independent news website. And police say
*03:42.900- 03:49.520* :  that more than a dozen locations were raided and they had seized several laptops of telephones
*03:49.520- 03:54.900* :  or mobile phones of these journalists. And this is set in a strong condemnation from various
*03:54.900- 04:00.740* :  media groups, rights groups in India. They say that it is an attempt to control the press,
*04:00.740- 04:06.540* :  to control dissent in the country. And this is part of an ongoing efforts by the government,
*04:06.540- 04:12.300* :  the Hindu Nationalist BJP government to intimidate the press because this particular website had
*04:12.300- 04:18.180* :  been publishing articles critical of the government's policies and what these policies are having
*04:18.180- 04:23.480* :  an impact on millions of people in India. But the government denies that it is going after the
*04:23.480- 04:29.200* :  press. It says that India has a very vibrant and free press. There is another read to Envara Sen.
*04:29.200- 04:35.640* :  isn't there at the website's office in Delhi? This is in regard to what the New York Times published
*04:35.640- 04:42.880* :  last month. A detailed investigative report talked about a US millionaire. He was setting up
*04:42.880- 04:48.360* :  in various funds and shell companies to donate money to various think tanks and the news website
*04:48.620- 04:54.900* :  to put forward a Chinese propaganda. So this was the allegation made by the New York Times.
*04:54.900- 05:00.340* :  So the latest rates on this news click website comes after this report was published.
*05:00.340- 05:06.520* :  And now the police have registered a case under anti-terror laws. That means that anyone who gets
*05:06.520- 05:12.820* :  arrested in this case, it will be difficult for them to get bail. But the news click website has
*05:12.820- 05:17.640* :  firmly rejected these allegations that they were also part of these efforts to put forward
*05:17.640- 05:23.740* :  Chinese point of view. As you may know, India and China, they have raging border tensions for
*05:23.740- 05:29.780* :  the past few years. And the both countries have been accusing each other of trying to occupy
*05:29.780- 05:35.220* :  each other's territory. So this is in the background of what the New York Times said. So that is why
*05:35.220- 05:40.320* :  police say that this is in regard to money laundering and connection with money laundering
*05:40.320- 05:46.060* :  allegations against this news portal in India. The Republican has speaker in the United States,
*05:46.060- 05:51.780* :  Kevin McCarthy, is facing a direct threat to his leadership after a hard-line fellow Republican
*05:51.780- 05:56.940* :  called for a vote to ask him. Declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives to
*05:56.940- 06:02.340* :  be vacant resolved that the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared
*06:02.340- 06:08.380* :  to be vacant. Republican Congressman Matt Gates introduced the motion after Mr. McCarthy had
*06:08.380- 06:13.540* :  cooperated with the Democrats to pass a funding bill that averted a government shutdown.
*06:13.540- 06:19.000* :  To the fury of Mr. Gates and some of his colleagues, as our US correspondent Peter Boes
*06:19.180- 06:25.080* :  told Alex Ritson. Well, this follows those protracted negotiations in the House of Representatives
*06:25.080- 06:31.600* :  over the past few weeks. Negotiations that led to this short-term budget being passed on
*06:31.600- 06:37.980* :  Saturday night. It was possible only because the majority Republicans had the support of House
*06:37.980- 06:43.320* :  Democrats. In fact, more Democrats voted for the stopgap bill than Republicans. And the Democrats
*06:43.320- 06:47.300* :  didn't get everything they wanted, including aid for Ukraine, but they had a significant
*06:47.300- 06:53.160* :  input in the bill. And the fact that there was this cross-party cooperation angered those
*06:53.160- 06:58.480* :  on the far right of the Republican side who flatly disagree with doing deals with the Democrats
*06:58.480- 07:03.380* :  and Matt Gates was quick to indicate that he would attempt to get Kevin McCarthy ousted from his
*07:03.380- 07:08.040* :  job. And that's what he's doing with this motion. And Kevin McCarthy has responded, what
*07:08.380- 07:13.560* :  as he said. Yeah, in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Kevin McCarthy's response was brief though,
*07:13.560- 07:18.620* :  it was to the point he said, bring it on. He is going to fight this, and of course he is well
*07:18.620- 07:24.620* :  used to fighting for his job. He won a really marathon struggle to become speaker in January after
*07:25.000- 07:30.060* :  apparently promising those on the right of his party that he wouldn't make such deals with
*07:30.060- 07:36.100* :  the Democrats. He clinched the job after some 15 rounds of voting. He also, at that time,
*07:36.100- 07:42.400* :  promised to change the House rules to allow any one member to call for a vote to oust the speaker,
*07:42.400- 07:47.080* :  which is exactly what's happened. So he's been on thin ice ever since he got the job.
*07:47.840- 07:53.360* :  Peter Bose. In Australia, votes are being casted early in a landmark referendum which could
*07:53.360- 07:58.900* :  result in a permanent body of indigenous people to advise Parliament. A guest vote would see
*07:58.900- 08:03.780* :  Aboriginal and Torres Strait uninterpeople included in the Constitution for the first time.
*08:04.320- 08:07.620* :  Supporters in favour of establishing the body include the country's Prime Minister,
*08:07.620- 08:13.620* :  Antony Albanese, who says it will help introduce laws to address inequality. But critics insist
*08:13.620- 08:20.240* :  the body will be divisive and ineffectual. The referendum has divided many. I'm concerned about
*08:20.720- 08:25.620* :  if the voice where they're just saying to Parliament, there could be legal challenges where some
*08:25.620- 08:31.520* :  Americans call to claim people's lands like where people live, their houses, and it's not fair.
*08:32.040- 08:37.320* :  We're just hundreds of years behind the risk of the planet, Australia, marginalising the Indigenous
*08:37.320- 08:43.480* :  people, putting them down, putting them in jail, locking them up. It's so embarrassing to be in
*08:43.480- 08:49.180* :  Australia. From Sydney, Phil Mercer told us more about the issue and what it would mean for Indigenous
*08:49.180- 08:55.320* :  people in Australia. Australians have a very big decision to make. Referendums don't come along
*08:55.320- 09:02.600* :  very often. The last was in 1999, when the country rejected an opportunity to sever its
*09:02.600- 09:09.200* :  constitutional ties to the British monarchy and become a republic. What the Australian Prime Minister
*09:09.200- 09:16.340* :  Antony Albanese wants to do is to see this referendum pass and set up a so-called Indigenous
*09:16.340- 09:23.840* :  voice to Parliament. This would be enshrined in the Constitution. It would offer non-binding advice
*09:23.840- 09:32.000* :  to Parliament and the Government. The vote takes place on Saturday, October 14th, but early
*09:32.000- 09:39.080* :  polling stations have opened up now in every of Australia's six states and two main territories.
*09:39.080- 09:44.800* :  So referendum day is ten days away, but the race for votes is already underway.
*09:45.340- 09:50.800* :  As we heard there from campaigners, this one is really this referendum is really dividing
*09:50.800- 09:55.300* :  opinion, isn't it? It is. You have on the one side the Prime Minister
*09:55.300- 10:02.720* :  Antony Albanese who believes that the voice this Indigenous advisory panel would deliver positive
*10:02.780- 10:09.680* :  outcomes for Indigenous people who by and large are the most disadvantaged people in the country.
*10:09.680- 10:15.800* :  They suffer very high rates of unemployment, poverty, ill health and imprisonment. Indigenous
*10:15.800- 10:21.800* :  Australians on average live eight years less than non-Indigenous people. On the other side of
*10:21.800- 10:27.560* :  the debate you have the no campaign. This is a very broad church, including opposition, conservative
*10:27.560- 10:34.180* :  politicians. They criticise the lack of specific detail about what the voice will actually do,
*10:34.180- 10:40.440* :  how it will work and who will be on it. There are other campaigners who say that the whole proposal
*10:40.440- 10:46.080* :  presumes that Indigenous people will always be disadvantaged and will always need special
*10:46.080- 10:52.680* :  treatments. So as we heard from those two voters earlier, this has been a very divisive debate.
*10:53.340- 10:59.280* :  And yet, as you mentioned, the advice from the body of Indigenous people if it's voted through,
*10:59.600- 11:07.220* :  it wouldn't be binding. So why such a fuss about it? I think what the problem that some Australians
*11:07.400- 11:13.740* :  have. There has been a lot of misinformation, a lot of disinformation about the voice. We heard
*11:13.740- 11:19.900* :  earlier that some people believe that the voices will be able to impose a rent on ordinary people
*11:19.900- 11:24.740* :  for living on Indigenous lands. Now the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says this clearly
*11:24.740- 11:31.300* :  is not the case that the voice to Parliament will not have special powers. It will not be able to
*11:31.300- 11:38.440* :  veto government decisions and will be an advisory body, essentially giving Aboriginal people a
*11:38.440- 11:45.000* :  direct line into the heart of government. And millions of Australians will vote before referendum
*11:45.020- 11:50.700* :  day, but the big decision will come for this country on the 14th of October.
*11:51.140- 11:56.840* :  Phil Mercer. Two people and their pet dog have been killed in a rare grizzly bear attack in
*11:56.840- 12:02.280* :  Banff National Park in Alberta and Canada. The cases are pulled. The country, a Stephanie
*12:02.280- 12:07.280* :  Printer has told me. Park Canada, who run this region, they've said it was a couple out in a
*12:07.280- 12:12.260* :  remote part of the park with their dog when they came into some sort of contact with a grizzly bear.
*12:12.260- 12:17.240* :  It's unclear whether it was accidental or whether it was an attack. They did somehow manage to
*12:17.240- 12:21.600* :  send out an emergency alert calling for help. And teams immediately responded, but they just
*12:21.600- 12:26.140* :  couldn't get a helicopter up to them. It was bad weather. They had to trek there on foot and they
*12:26.140- 12:31.040* :  thought there were a few hours later to find two bodies. They have to the victims of Canadian
*12:31.040- 12:36.000* :  citizens, but they have no more information that they've released yet. The bear itself was still
*12:36.000- 12:41.300* :  in the camp close to the bodies. Park Rangers said it was demonstrating aggressive behaviour and
*12:41.300- 12:45.400* :  they shot it dead. And they've now closed off the area to bring in teams to try and work at what
*12:45.400- 12:50.940* :  happened and give the relatives some sort of answers. And how unusual is this kind of attack?
*12:52.060- 12:56.260* :  Well, Bamf is a place that really showcases the best of Canada. It's those pictures you see
*12:56.260- 13:01.300* :  of turquoise waters, rocky mountains reflecting them. And as such, you get tourists from all around
*13:01.300- 13:05.600* :  the world, more than four million a year there, as well as Canadians that go there on holiday.
*13:05.600- 13:10.600* :  So given that level of football, bear encounters are actually very rare. There's only about
*13:10.600- 13:16.280* :  60 to 65 grizzlies in the entire park as well as some black bears, but those encounters and
*13:16.280- 13:22.240* :  those sightings are increasing recently, according to experts. More people are in the park, bears are
*13:22.240- 13:26.940* :  out looking for food before they hibernate for winter from around October onwards. But generally
*13:26.940- 13:32.880* :  speaking, around the world, only 14% of grizzly bear attacks lead to fatalities. Usually people
*13:32.880- 13:37.300* :  just make a lot of noise in the bear runs away. So this case has been particularly shocking.
*13:37.300- 13:42.460* :  And what's been reaction to it? Well, family members of the deceased have said they were always
*13:42.460- 13:47.820* :  out in national parks. They knew bear protocol and they followed it to a T. But the attack has
*13:47.820- 13:52.480* :  prompted media encounter to reissue the advice that everyone kind of knows there around entering
*13:52.480- 13:57.040* :  the bear's habitat. That includes things like traveling in groups, making a lot of noise during
*13:57.040- 14:01.600* :  a trek so you don't suddenly need startle a bear, carrying bear spray and for hikers to leave an
*14:01.600- 14:06.580* :  area if they see things like claw marks or maybe an animal carcass or something. There's also
*14:06.580- 14:11.640* :  been some shock online around the bear being killed, given they are considered to be a threatened
*14:11.640- 14:17.300* :  population in Alberta. And on the flip side of that it's been a sort of conversation around
*14:17.300- 14:23.100* :  gun rights. So some people are tweeting to call for looser rules on guns there to enable hikers
*14:23.100- 14:28.080* :  to defend themselves. There's been a lot of response from different corners but overall just
*14:28.360- 14:33.380* :  a real sense of sadness for this young couple. They were said to be huge lovers of the outdoors
*14:33.880- 14:38.180* :  and as a couple they were said to be inseparable. Stephanie Prentice
*14:40.920- 14:47.180* :  Still to calm on this podcast pressure grows on Japan's government to legalize same-sex unions.
*14:47.580- 14:54.400* :  I don't feel that we're protected here as a couple. When I gave birth I wrote a
*14:54.400- 14:58.940* :  will to appoint my partner as the legal guardian of our son. And even that didn't guarantee her
*15:06.600- 15:11.700* :  custody. Pope Francis has suggested that same-sex couples could be blessed by the Catholic church in
*15:11.700- 15:16.960* :  the future. While some other Christian denominations of allowed gay marriages and blessings the Vatican
*15:16.960- 15:22.960* :  has always rejected the move. Charlotte Gallagher reports. Pope Francis is viewed as more liberal
*15:22.960- 15:29.540* :  than his predecessors speaking out against LGBTQ discrimination declaring that being homosexual
*15:29.740- 15:36.420* :  isn't a crime. He's now suggesting that priests could bless same-sex couples in contradiction
*15:36.420- 15:42.920* :  of official Vatican policy. In a letter to Cardinals Francis wrote that any request for a blessing
*15:42.920- 15:50.860* :  must be treated with pastoral charity and we cannot be judges who only deny reject and exclude.
*15:51.020- 15:57.480* :  But he also added the church still considered same-sex relationships sinful and would not
*15:57.480- 16:04.400* :  recognise gay marriage. But even the idea of blessing same-sex couples puts Pope Francis on
*16:04.400- 16:10.360* :  a collision course with the more conservative members of his church. They're already unhappy with
*16:10.360- 16:16.260* :  his views on LGBTQ issues, the role of women in the church and divorce. Some Catholic leaders
*16:16.260- 16:21.260* :  have accused the Pope of diluting their faith and have even called for his resignation.
*16:22.120- 16:28.320* :  Charlotte Gallagher and pressure has been mounting on Japan's government to legalise same-sex unions.
*16:28.320- 16:33.660* :  After a court ruled earlier this year that a ban on them is unconstitutional. The world's
*16:33.660- 16:39.560* :  third largest economy is the only G7 country not to fully recognise same-sex couples or to offer
*16:39.560- 16:45.300* :  them clear legal protection. Parliament has recently passed a law targeting discrimination against
*16:45.300- 16:51.460* :  sexual minorities but it stops well-short of marriage equality. Atoukou correspondent Shama
*16:51.460- 17:02.440* :  Kareel reports. Aki and Hikari have been together for seven years. Now the same-sex couple are
*17:02.440- 17:07.420* :  parents to a one-month-old baby. There are many things to get used to for the new mothers.
*17:08.140- 17:13.160* :  Among them is the fact that only Aki, who gave birth to their son, has parental rights.
*17:17.420- 17:22.040* :  I don't feel that we're protected here as a couple. When I gave birth I wrote a will to
*17:22.040- 17:27.860* :  appoint my partner as the legal guardian of our son, in case I died during labour. And even that
*17:27.860- 17:35.300* :  didn't guarantee her custody. Despite the support around them, they've kept the relationship a
*17:35.300- 17:41.000* :  secret from many people. It's why they don't want to reveal their real names. Aki and Hikari Shiyama
*17:41.000- 17:46.560* :  is the deputy secretary-general of the Japan Alliance for LGBT legislation. Through her work,
*17:46.560- 17:51.900* :  and as a young gay person, she knows firsthand how difficult it is to feel invisible in the
*17:51.900- 17:57.980* :  eyes of the law, the government, and a conservative male-dominated society. Because they are not legally
*17:57.980- 18:04.980* :  considered as a family. For instance, let's say when one of them was sent to hospital, when they
*18:04.980- 18:11.400* :  need a surgery or any medical procedures, even if the same sex partner wants to sign the
*18:11.400- 18:17.100* :  paper for consent, maybe the doctors or other people at the hospital, and reject because they are
*18:17.100- 18:22.260* :  not considered as a family, legally family. Same sex couples could apply for special permissions
*18:22.260- 18:30.680* :  in these circumstances, but the decision depends on the discretion of officials. Parliament has
*18:30.680- 18:36.300* :  recently enacted a law to promote understanding of sexual minorities. Despite fear spushback from
*18:36.300- 18:44.080* :  conservative lawmakers within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. But the law stops short of legalising
*18:44.080- 18:49.680* :  same sex marriage, and the wording angered many activists who took to the streets outside the
*18:49.680- 18:54.320* :  Parliament building. It says that in taking measures to promote understanding of sexual minorities,
*18:55.080- 19:00.480* :  schools, workplaces, and organizations, must ensure that all citizens can live with peace of mind.
*19:00.480- 19:05.080* :  Critics have said the law prioritised the rights of the majority, and implied that the
*19:05.080- 19:09.560* :  existence of the LGBTQ community was a threat to the public's peace of mind.
*19:13.060- 19:17.380* :  It was parenthood that encouraged Hikari and Aki to come out to their families and their
*19:17.380- 19:22.980* :  close circle of friends and to consider marriage. When their application was rejected in Japan,
*19:22.980- 19:29.040* :  they got married in Canada, or Hikari went to university. I ask her if she sees a future for
*19:29.040- 19:37.840* :  her small family here. If you ask me, yes, I can actually. We are very fortunate to have lots of
*19:37.840- 19:43.400* :  support, so I can see our future where we live happily here. I do hope that the same sex marriage
*19:43.400- 19:48.140* :  is accepted one day, though. Aki, I'm wondering why you chose to live in a country where
*19:48.140- 19:58.900* :  your relationship is not recognised? Also, if we live overseas, we would
*19:58.900- 20:05.500* :  become minorities there, boners. Here, we're supported by many people. We also need to show that we
*20:05.500- 20:12.500* :  exist. Aki and Hikari are both hopeful that one day they'll be legally married in Japan,
*20:12.500- 20:18.880* :  and that their son will be at their wedding. For now, all they want for him is to live in a society
*20:19.480- 20:21.420* :  that accepts his family without prejudice.
*20:25.240- 20:32.340* :  Shima Khalil. In China, people are already looking ahead to 2024, which, according to superstition,
*20:32.340- 20:38.200* :  is set to be a very unlucky one for some. Our China media analyst, Keriala, told me more.
*20:38.700- 20:43.320* :  It's a year that's based on the lunar calendar that's associated with infertility and
*20:43.320- 20:48.600* :  widowhood. Now, it's a superstition, and this doesn't happen very often, but it's considered a
*20:48.800- 20:55.060* :  solar and lunar mismatch. So, if you think of the ideas of Yin and Yang being basically, yes,
*20:55.060- 21:01.140* :  the sun and the moon, but also a relationship, the idea is that women who marry will either become
*21:01.140- 21:05.680* :  widows, their marriages will break down, they'll become infertile, although children will suffer
*21:05.680- 21:09.320* :  bad luck. So, generally, it's a year that some people don't want to get married.
*21:10.100- 21:14.560* :  Want to avoid, indeed. But, I mean, you have to be pretty superstitious. Don't you
*21:14.560- 21:22.040* :  to believe in a widow year? It is quite widespread. So, the last widow year was in 2010, and there was
*21:22.040- 21:27.960* :  a lot of media at this time about how some couples rush to get married sooner, and what I'm seeing
*21:27.960- 21:32.720* :  in Chinese media today is reports that if people do want to get married, that they should
*21:33.080- 21:38.560* :  think about doing it now before the lunar new year comes round in 2024. But also, there are some
*21:38.560- 21:43.260* :  young people who are skeptical. I mean, these are superstitions, but what they don't want to do is
*21:43.540- 21:48.200* :  offend their elders, their parents, their grandparents, who do believe this. And this isn't just the case
*21:48.200- 21:53.960* :  for China, people in China, it's also the case for overseas Chinese as well. So, are people actually
*21:53.960- 21:59.320* :  not making wedding plans? Because that means others will suffer, won't they? I'm thinking of
*21:59.320- 22:04.800* :  hospitality, hotels, they won't get the bookings. Absolutely, and we're reading about this today because
*22:04.800- 22:10.600* :  it's Golden Week in China. So, it's a week long holiday when people gather with their families.
*22:11.160- 22:15.700* :  So, the idea is really being pushed on Chinese people that this is a good period of time. If you
*22:15.700- 22:20.360* :  want to get married, try and get married as soon as possible. But what I've been seeing over a
*22:20.360- 22:25.520* :  number of years now in China are reports that marriage is just no longer popular anymore. And it's
*22:25.520- 22:30.920* :  largely a hangover from the one child policy because there is a smaller demographic of young people.
*22:31.420- 22:36.320* :  The older generation are retiring and it means that young people are working longer hours.
*22:36.560- 22:41.300* :  And so, they don't really have time to meet partners. Also, they're watching their money a lot
*22:41.300- 22:47.040* :  more. So, the idea of getting married in general is very expensive. And are the state trying to counter
*22:47.040- 22:51.860* :  this and indeed the superstitions? Absolutely. Yes, it's been a priority in the government for the
*22:51.860- 22:57.240* :  last few years to really prioritize a lot of messaging on marriage to tell people getting
*22:57.240- 23:01.660* :  married is a good idea because as well as marriage, there's the birth rate. So, it recognizes
*23:01.660- 23:06.640* :  that there is a much smaller birth rate as a hangover from the one child policy. So, it wants people
*23:06.640- 23:13.760* :  having children as well. Kerry Allen. And finally, to a new Vincent Van Gogh exhibition at the Musee
*23:13.760- 23:19.040* :  Dorsey in Paris, where visitors will be able to ask the great artist's questions with the help
*23:19.040- 23:24.460* :  of artificial intelligence. What is your favourite painting? It's hard for me to choose a favourite
*23:24.460- 23:29.400* :  painting among my artworks because each painting is dead to me in its own way. But if I have to choose
*23:29.400- 23:33.860* :  one, I think my painting called Stora Knight is one of my favourites. The painting depicts the
*23:33.860- 23:39.100* :  village of Saint-Ramey in southern France with vibrant colours in a swelling sky. So, people can now
*23:39.100- 23:45.720* :  hear how Van Gogh, who died in 1890, might have answered their questions in a range of languages.
*23:46.360- 23:51.080* :  The responses are based on a database which came partly from work by Wüter at Van Der Vien,
*23:51.080- 23:56.480* :  an art historian at the University of Strasbourg and the author of books on Vincent Van Gogh.
*23:56.740- 24:03.880* :  He's been speaking to Misha Hossein. Primarily, we choose to feed the AI with Van Gogh's correspondence.
*24:03.900- 24:09.700* :  He wrote about 900 letters, so that's about 1 million words. And it sounds like a lot for
*24:09.700- 24:14.900* :  human being, but for the AI, it was quite easy to digest and ingest this good large
*24:14.900- 24:21.960* :  quantity of data. And do all the letters date from this period? Because this exhibition is specifically
*24:21.960- 24:29.040* :  about work produced by him in the last two months of his life at Overseas who was near Paris.
*24:29.040- 24:34.520* :  Was that a very important period creatively? Yes, it was his final outburst of an incredible
*24:34.520- 24:40.380* :  number of high quality works, really great masterpiece such as the Church of Overt, the portrait
*24:40.380- 24:45.980* :  of Dr. Gase, Wheatfield with Crores, were created in a very short time. But of course,
*24:45.980- 24:51.960* :  when he is in Overseas, it's the very end of his life. And all the books he read, all the people
*24:51.960- 24:58.620* :  he knows, they are in his head. And my job was to provide the machine with all that information.
*24:58.820- 25:03.520* :  Did you, well, was it all of it or did you hold anything back? Well, it was all of it,
*25:03.520- 25:07.840* :  but still it's fragments. We, of course, we do not have all the information about Vincent Van Gogh
*25:08.000- 25:13.280* :  that would not be possible. So it's like our own memories. We all, the history comes to us through
*25:13.280- 25:18.680* :  fragments that we can remember. And we just connect the dots. And that's what the AI has to do
*25:18.680- 25:24.040* :  also in an autonomous manner. And that's when you can have some surprises, of course, and you have
*25:24.040- 25:30.120* :  to train the AI. So when we hear an answer like the one a moment ago saying his favorite painting
*25:30.120- 25:36.360* :  war starry night, do we know that is that documented? No, we don't. It is improvised by the AI.
*25:36.360- 25:40.820* :  He must have deduced that from, from the letters and from the information we gave him. We
*25:40.820- 25:47.840* :  did not guide that. But sometimes, yes, sometimes he, he answers that his favorite painting is
*25:47.840- 25:52.240* :  some flowers that that makes him quite human also because he shifts from time to time. And I think
*25:52.240- 25:55.960* :  that if you ask him to do anybody, you will have different answers also. Right. So they are
*25:55.960- 26:02.800* :  credible then the answer. No, no, we should not trust this machine. It is still in infancy.
*26:02.800- 26:07.600* :  It is, it is only a couple of weeks old. And it's learning. And this is an experimental phase. And
*26:07.640- 26:11.620* :  what I noticed from the engineers are working on it. They are like the inventors of air travel,
*26:11.700- 26:17.200* :  you know, when the first aircraft took off. And even if they crashed after one minute, everybody
*26:17.200- 26:22.060* :  was very happy because it proved that the technology was working. And that's where we are now.
*26:22.680- 26:24.600* :  Art historian, Vutta van der Vee.
*26:26.560- 26:30.220* :  And that's it from us for now. But there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
