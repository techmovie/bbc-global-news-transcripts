*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service, with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:17.020- 00:21.600* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*00:21.880- 00:25.360* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets.
*00:25.500- 00:28.780* :  I was overwhelmed, like I'd never seen anything like this.
*00:29.000- 00:31.660* :  At the height of Abercrombie and Fitch's success.
*00:31.940- 00:34.340* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.
*00:34.660- 00:37.540* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity.
*00:37.900- 00:43.580* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money, sex and power.
*00:44.560- 00:49.260* :  This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
*00:49.540- 00:51.660* :  Listen, wherever you get your podcasts.
*00:55.980- 00:58.560* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:01.160- 01:05.340* :  I'm Nick Miles, are at 13 hours GMT on the 4th of October. These are our main stories.
*01:05.920- 01:08.380* :  Women, homosexuality and climate change.
*01:08.380- 01:13.900* :  Pope Francis looks to the future of the Catholic Church, but how divided are his followers?
*01:14.620- 01:20.300* :  Britain's governing party tries to transform its electoral prospects as it lags in the polls.
*01:20.840- 01:25.320* :  And Colombia's apologies to the families of those murdered in death targets.
*01:28.100- 01:29.020* :  Also in this podcast.
*01:38.520- 01:42.660* :  We are spreading the news. Frank Sinatra is back on stage.
*01:52.480- 01:53.820* :  Top of the heap.
*01:59.580- 02:02.180* :  We begin in Vatican City in Rome.
*02:13.220- 02:17.840* :  Where Pope Francis has opened a major meeting of the Roman Catholic Church.
*02:18.740- 02:24.080* :  Rarely in recent times has a Vatican gathering generated as much hope and fear as this one.
*02:24.560- 02:29.600* :  On the agenda is climate change, but they will also be considering many aspects of the church
*02:29.600- 02:35.600* :  and its future, including the role of women and the question of its attitude towards homosexuality.
*02:36.300- 02:41.820* :  Our religion editor, Ali McBawle, is in Vatican City and has been telling me what has happened so far.
*02:42.260- 02:47.720* :  It started with the Pope presiding over mass here in St. Peter Square and then, yes,
*02:47.720- 02:53.720* :  the opening of the Bishop's Conference. And then, just a couple of hours ago, almost
*02:54.020- 02:59.440* :  eclipsing all of that, the Pope released this new document about the climate crisis.
*02:59.440- 03:07.180* :  And we know throughout his papacy, Pope Francis has been very clear on his views on climate change.
*03:07.180- 03:15.920* :  He released in 2015 an encyclical on climate change, that is the highest level of teaching
*03:15.920- 03:22.860* :  document a Pope can release. But since then, he's reflected in this document on what's happened
*03:22.900- 03:30.000* :  and he says, essentially, that it's got to the stage now where the world didn't act with urgency
*03:30.000- 03:35.880* :  and as such, there are already issues with the climate that are irreversible, at least for
*03:35.880- 03:42.460* :  several hundred years. So he's been critical of global decision making bodies, saying they've
*03:42.460- 03:48.120* :  been ineffective. He's criticized politicians, some of those who deny the problem, some of those
*03:48.120- 03:55.100* :  he accuses of acting so slowly in moving away from fossil fuels to other sources of energy,
*03:55.100- 04:02.020* :  that it may even look like they are diverting attention. And then, he's also criticized some
*04:02.020- 04:08.840* :  individuals, particularly in the West. He particularly singled out the amount of emissions per
*04:08.840- 04:15.260* :  individual in the U.S., which he says was double that of the emissions of someone in China,
*04:15.260- 04:20.680* :  and seven times as much the emissions for someone, the average person in the poorest country.
*04:20.680- 04:27.860* :  So a very, very strong document and a major moment in his sort of fight to get people to act
*04:27.860- 04:32.600* :  more quickly on climate change. Alim, climate change is a topic that's likely to unite
*04:32.600- 04:37.860* :  most of the bishops there, but there are other subjects on the agenda that are far more divisive,
*04:37.860- 04:47.140* :  aren't they? Yes, so the bishop's conference will last for 26 days. The agenda has been drawn up
*04:47.480- 04:51.840* :  from a massive consultation that's taken place over two years. They've been trying to reach
*04:51.840- 04:56.220* :  as many Catholics all over the world, as they can over those two years, to ask what's
*04:56.320- 05:01.080* :  important to them. And a couple of issues came up very high on the priority list on our major
*05:02.440- 05:09.460* :  points of discussion through this conference. One is the role of women over which, of course,
*05:09.460- 05:15.720* :  there's much division in the Catholic Church. Of course, women can't be ordained in the Catholic
*05:15.720- 05:21.140* :  Church at the moment, but they have been asked to find a way to move forward so women can be part
*05:21.140- 05:28.040* :  of the decision-making process. And the other key issue is how to better include LGBTQ plus Catholics.
*05:28.740- 05:35.100* :  Alimukbal. Murders, rapes, torture. There were countless human rights abuses during
*05:35.100- 05:41.600* :  Colombia's decades-long civil war, but none were perhaps as horrendous as cynical as the killing
*05:41.600- 05:47.640* :  by the army of thousands of civilians that were then passed off as guerrilla fighters simply to
*05:47.640- 05:52.580* :  meet death targets. Well, now the families of those killed have received an apology for the
*05:52.580- 05:57.600* :  first time from the government. At an event in Bogota, attended by the families of 19 victims,
*05:57.600- 06:02.980* :  the president Gustavo Pedro asked for forgiveness for a policy that offered those soldiers
*06:02.980- 06:08.900* :  leave days and decoration. I ask for your forgiveness.
*06:13.360- 06:22.640* :  Murders, you are the mothers of all Colombia. You are the motherland. May the blood of your children
*06:22.760- 06:29.800* :  water the furrow of human Colombia that we will become tomorrow, of the powerful army that we will
*06:29.800- 06:39.180* :  have tomorrow, not to kill, but to live. But for Mr. Pedro, this is a personal issue. For in his youth,
*06:39.260- 06:44.260* :  he was a member of a militant group. He was detained, tortured and imprisoned by the states.
*06:44.960- 06:47.700* :  Nevertheless, his words didn't impress people at the event.
*06:47.840- 06:52.980* :  Luceno Carmona's son, Omar Leonardo Tiriana, was amongst those killed by the army.
*06:56.280- 07:01.960* :  Blessed be very clear that today, my family and I are not granting forgiveness. For us,
*07:01.960- 07:07.820* :  it's very painful because we're still in a moment of total impunity. I've been waiting more than
*07:07.820- 07:13.180* :  16 years for justice to be served, for the truth to be found, and for there to be no more
*07:13.180- 07:20.940* :  repetition of these cases. I've been speaking to William Marquez from BBC Mundo, more about the
*07:20.940- 07:26.880* :  killings that led to the government's apology. They were known or came to be known as the false
*07:26.880- 07:33.160* :  positive scandal, and it happened during a right-wing president's government, Alberto Rive,
*07:33.160- 07:41.460* :  between 2002 and 2008. He had a very aggressive policy against the rebels. He had some very good
*07:41.460- 07:47.400* :  military results, which made him very popular amongst certain sectors, and the military were
*07:47.400- 07:52.580* :  given incentives to show better results. But what they were actually doing was killing innocent
*07:52.580- 07:58.900* :  civilians, passing them off as guerrilla casualties killed in action. There were many members of the
*07:58.900- 08:03.920* :  same families who were killed, even children, as young as 14. And getting credit for it almost?
*08:03.920- 08:08.500* :  Yes, yes, they were. In what sense? What was happening? Well, they were given
*08:10.120- 08:17.080* :  scholarships, they were promoted, and this all served the purposes of the president who was showing
*08:17.080- 08:23.080* :  good results to a good sector of the population who would elect them.
*08:23.300- 08:29.120* :  And we've heard reaction to the apology from that person. It's been mirrored by a lot of other
*08:29.120- 08:33.660* :  people's reaction as well, and that is possibly because a lot of these soldiers will perhaps never
*08:33.660- 08:41.160* :  be held to account. Yes, after the peace treaty with the Farqq guerrillas, there was a judicial
*08:42.620- 08:50.240* :  body that was created, and there was a process of mechanism by which any crime committed by any of
*08:50.240- 08:56.560* :  the parts in the conflict who confessed to it would not be prosecuted. So there's no expectation
*08:56.560- 09:03.040* :  that anyone will. William Marquez. A British Army investigation has found that a teenage
*09:03.040- 09:09.560* :  female soldier who died at her barracks in 2021 probably took her own life. The BBC has seen
*09:09.560- 09:16.160* :  an official report on the death of 19-year-old Jaisley Beck. It suggests relentless sexual harassment
*09:16.160- 09:21.000* :  from her boss may have contributed. Here's our home affairs correspondent, June Kelly.
*09:21.580- 09:26.160* :  The report describes how Jaisley Beck's immediate boss wanted a relationship with her.
*09:26.640- 09:33.000* :  She didn't feel the same. In October 2021, he sent her over a thousand WhatsApp messages and
*09:33.000- 09:38.440* :  voice mails. The following month, this increased to more than three and a half thousand. This was
*09:38.440- 09:43.940* :  part of his obsessive behaviour, which the report says took a toll on her mental well-being.
*09:44.640- 09:49.620* :  Her mother, Leanne McCready, has told the BBC that Jaisley said there was no point in reporting
*09:49.620- 09:54.800* :  her boss. This was because when another officer had sexually assaulted her a few months before,
*09:54.860- 10:00.760* :  he had merely been told to write her a letter of apology. No one is named in the report.
*10:01.580- 10:06.220* :  An inquest which will officially decide the cause of Jaisley Beck's death is yet to be held.
*10:06.220- 10:10.700* :  The army said their thoughts and sympathies were with her family and friends.
*10:10.700- 10:17.140* :  That was June Kelly. The US government has announced sanctions on more than 20 individuals and
*10:17.140- 10:23.040* :  entities based in China, which make and distribute compounds which are later used in illegal drugs.
*10:23.040- 10:28.800* :  They include ingredients for fentanyl. That's a synthetic opioid that's been blamed for
*10:28.800- 10:34.300* :  tens of thousands of recent deaths in America. Our North America correspondent Peter Boes reports from
*10:34.300- 10:40.620* :  Los Angeles. This is indeed an attempt to clump down on what are known as the precursor chemicals,
*10:40.620- 10:47.980* :  the raw ingredients that go into making fentanyl. This synthetic opioid that is so deadly, as you say,
*10:47.980- 10:54.680* :  responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in the United States alone every year.
*10:54.880- 11:00.880* :  According to the Justice Department here, it is Chinese companies that are responsible for making
*11:00.880- 11:09.020* :  these precursor chemicals that then find their way into the fentanyl compound, which is again
*11:09.640- 11:16.880* :  then used by Mexican drug cartels as part of their operation of getting drugs into the United States.
*11:17.020- 11:23.840* :  There is a global chain, if you like, and a chain that starts in China. That's why the Justice
*11:23.840- 11:30.300* :  Department has announced this clump down in terms of indictments and sanctions against those
*11:30.300- 11:36.940* :  companies. The sanctions mean that they will essentially be cut off from the US financial system.
*11:37.400- 11:43.020* :  That means in turn that anyone in this country doing any kind of business with those entities
*11:43.600- 11:49.080* :  will be breaking the law and would themselves find themselves at the end of a lawsuit.
*11:49.080- 11:54.940* :  So this is a US wide, but you could see it more globally in terms of its likely impact.
*11:54.940- 12:01.720* :  Peter Boes. Police in Jamaica are investigating how 60 primary school children were sold
*12:01.720- 12:06.720* :  sweet, laced with cannabis. The pupils, some as young as seven, would take it to hospital.
*12:07.280- 12:09.180* :  Nick Davis reports from the Capitol Kingston.
*12:09.660- 12:15.320* :  Buying sweets is, for many pupils, the highlight of their day. Outside most schools here,
*12:15.320- 12:20.260* :  you'll see street vendors with cheesy corn snacks, drinks and a bright array of biscuits and other
*12:20.260- 12:25.140* :  confectionery. But finding out that marijuana was in a batch sold to children, the resort town
*12:25.140- 12:31.660* :  of Ochoiris, has caused outrage across the country. Favour Williamsville education minister met with
*12:31.660- 12:37.740* :  parents of the affected children who experienced symptoms such as vomiting and hallucinations after
*12:37.740- 12:43.920* :  eating the sweets, but none are reported to be in a serious condition. She promised to strengthen
*12:43.920- 12:50.160* :  the safety and security regime to combat what she described as the unconscionable sale of marijuana
*12:50.160- 12:55.740* :  infused products to children. Jamaica may be seen by some outside of the country to have a
*12:55.740- 13:01.480* :  favorable attitude towards marijuana or ganger, but the Caribbean nation only decriminalised possession
*13:01.480- 13:08.420* :  in 2015, allowing up to 57 grammars for religious medicinal and scientific purposes only.
*13:08.660- 13:14.020* :  The sweet salt of a children were advertisers containing a hundred milligrams of THC,
*13:14.520- 13:19.960* :  a strong dose for experienced adults. Police have named a person of interest who they want to
*13:19.960- 13:24.960* :  speak to over the sale, but so far he hasn't come forward. Nick Davis.
*13:28.540- 13:33.200* :  Coming up. For centuries he was depicted as a criminal by the Dutch authorities,
*13:33.200- 13:38.680* :  even in Curacao, he was spoken of in a negative derogatory way, because that's the way he was
*13:38.680- 13:44.900* :  portrayed in the history books. The leader of a slave uprising finally gets at least a partial form
*13:52.440- 13:57.100* :  of justice. That world has in up and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*13:57.440- 14:03.800* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed like I'd never seen anything
*14:03.800- 14:09.940* :  like this at the height of Abercrombian fit to success. This was me being carefully manipulated.
*14:09.940- 14:15.920* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that would take me
*14:15.920- 14:24.860* :  into a world of money, sex and power. This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
*14:25.140- 14:27.240* :  Listen wherever you get your podcasts.
*14:32.160- 14:37.740* :  Here in the UK, the Prime Minister has just finished delivering what was built as a transformational
*14:37.900- 14:43.440* :  speech designed to boost his party's lagging poll ratings ahead of next year's expected general
*14:43.440- 14:48.440* :  election. After days of speculation, which have overshadowed the ruling conservative's conference,
*14:49.020- 14:53.940* :  Rishi Sunak confirmed that he was scrapping part of a controversial multi-billion dollar rail
*14:53.940- 14:59.520* :  project. He explained why he was canceling the section of the high speed two line known as HS2
*15:00.040- 15:07.000* :  that would have linked Northern England to London. HS2 is the ultimate example of the old
*15:07.000- 15:14.220* :  consensus. The result is a project whose costs have more than doubled, which has been repeatedly
*15:14.220- 15:21.060* :  delayed and it is not scheduled to reach here in Manchester for almost two decades and for which
*15:21.060- 15:27.160* :  the economic case has massively been weakened with the changes to business travel post-COVID.
*15:27.740- 15:33.940* :  The facts have changed and the right thing to do when the facts change is to have the courage
*15:33.940- 15:38.540* :  to change direction. Our political correspondent Rob Watson is at the conference.
*15:39.120- 15:44.400* :  As the Prime Minister has argued, I mean his case is that this is just good money after bad
*15:44.940- 15:48.820* :  and that essentially because the costs have gone up so much and because as he would argue that
*15:49.160- 15:53.840* :  the pattern of rail use has been changing, that it would be just smarter to reinvest the money
*15:53.840- 16:00.000* :  and it's sort of over 40 billion dollars into other infrastructure projects here in the north
*16:00.000- 16:05.460* :  and in the Midlands of the UK which are sort of parts of the country which are pretty far behind
*16:05.460- 16:11.260* :  the southeast of the country and London. So that's the argument that the money would be better
*16:11.260- 16:17.820* :  spent elsewhere but of course it is an enormous risk and of course there are plenty of people
*16:17.820- 16:23.240* :  who disagree with them about the facts changing. And plenty of people in the north of England
*16:23.240- 16:28.320* :  who voted conservative in the last general election who would be pretty miffed at this?
*16:29.320- 16:33.560* :  Well it's a mixed picture Nick. I mean it's certainly the true that an awful lot of business
*16:33.560- 16:38.560* :  leaders in the north and a lot of awful lot of politicians in the north both in the governing
*16:38.560- 16:43.480* :  conservative party and the opposition parties think that this is a massive mistake. One of them
*16:43.480- 16:48.900* :  has talked about this cancelling the north's future but actually that the sort of the picture
*16:48.940- 16:54.480* :  in terms of the polling amongst ordinary folk here in the north is somewhat mixed. I mean some
*16:54.480- 17:01.360* :  people would prefer to see more local trains. Some people do think that HS2 is a good idea.
*17:01.800- 17:07.960* :  So it's a rather mixed picture in terms of how is this going to play with the voters? I mean of
*17:07.960- 17:15.040* :  course what most people would like Nick is to have both HS2 and much better local infrastructure as well.
*17:15.040- 17:19.740* :  Absolutely. What about the rest of his speech if picking through it? Is there anything else
*17:19.800- 17:22.900* :  that was notable that might boost his re-election chances?
*17:24.160- 17:28.140* :  I mean the most important thing to say about these speeches Nick is that you have to remember that
*17:28.140- 17:33.880* :  there are 45 million eligible voters in this country. I'm an I suspect that probably fewer than
*17:34.140- 17:39.620* :  200,000 watch the whole speech. So one shouldn't overstate these things. It's more people vote
*17:39.620- 17:44.480* :  according to sort of general impressions and whether they feel their lives are getting better or
*17:44.500- 17:50.540* :  worse but I mean I guess he would say he was making this argument that he is you know he's a
*17:50.540- 17:55.040* :  sort of he as he would say at someone who tells it like it is. I mean whether people feel that way
*17:55.040- 18:01.300* :  I don't know but I mean that that is his pitch to the electors that somehow he represents change
*18:01.320- 18:06.780* :  but obviously after 13 years of the Conservatives in power it's a tricky argument to make Nick.
*18:07.280- 18:14.180* :  Rob Watson. The leader of a slave uprising on the island of Kurosawa a Dutch Caribbean settlement
*18:14.180- 18:20.000* :  is being formally rehabilitated by the Dutch government more than 200 years after he was killed.
*18:20.760- 18:27.160* :  Tula was one of a group of 50 slaves who downed tools on the Kenapa plantation in 1795
*18:27.160- 18:33.160* :  and marched towards the islands capital to demand freedom. Anahologin is in the hake and tell
*18:33.160- 18:38.700* :  me more about him. For centuries he was depicted as a criminal by the Dutch authorities even in
*18:38.700- 18:44.260* :  Kurosawa he was spoken of in a negative derogatory way because that's the way he was portrayed in
*18:44.280- 18:49.400* :  the history books in the Dutch teaching materials in schools which were of course based on the
*18:49.400- 18:54.840* :  Dutch education system. So for example in Kurosawa for a long time if you were seen to be working
*18:54.840- 19:01.260* :  too hard then you were called a Tula. It was only really in the 1980s that more and more people
*19:01.260- 19:07.660* :  in Kurosawa began to push for him to be recognized as a freedom fighter and a hero instead of a
*19:07.660- 19:12.980* :  criminal. He was declared a national hero in Kurosawa in 2010 and then he became a symbol of
*19:12.980- 19:18.920* :  resistance recognized as a symbol of resistance because he led this uprising so he stood up against
*19:18.920- 19:27.280* :  the oppressors. He went to his slave owner on the Kenapa plantation, August 17, 1795 refused to
*19:27.280- 19:32.740* :  go to work and then along with the 50 others they went round different plantations as they were
*19:32.740- 19:40.640* :  on their way to the capital and there they picked up thousands of more slaves and then eventually
*19:40.640- 19:46.800* :  there was a very bloody battle he was captured interrogated convicted and then publicly executed.
*19:47.200- 19:52.000* :  And Anna this is part of a wider move in the Netherlands to address its colonial legacy isn't it?
*19:52.520- 19:58.100* :  Exactly. Wide-ranging, reckoning, Dutch state, acknowledging and apologizing for this slavery
*19:58.100- 20:03.300* :  legacy so we had an apology from the Prime Minister I think last December in the summer king
*20:03.300- 20:08.240* :  Willem Alexander made a powerful speech he said of all the ways in which a person can be robbed
*20:08.240- 20:13.960* :  of their freedom slavery is surely the most painful, the most degrading, the most inhuman and he
*20:13.960- 20:19.540* :  said at the time he recognized how deep the wounds remain so this move the issuing of this decree
*20:19.540- 20:24.240* :  which we should say hasn't actually been issued yet because the weather was so bad on Kurosawa
*20:24.780- 20:29.520* :  the ceremony was was reigned off before they could deliver the decree officially but this is
*20:29.520- 20:34.080* :  all part of trying to reframe the narrative and the significance of truly being reimagined
*20:34.580- 20:38.760* :  historically means accepting that it wasn't the man that was wrong it was the system of oppression
*20:38.760- 20:45.360* :  that he rose up against. Anaheim. A court in Russia has handed out an eight and a half year jail
*20:45.360- 20:51.240* :  sentence to a journalist who interrupted state television news in protest at the invasion of
*20:51.240- 20:57.040* :  Ukraine Marina of Janikovar fled the country a year ago. Paul Moss reports.
*20:57.040- 21:02.460* :  The Russian authorities have done their best to smother any criticism of the invasion of Ukraine
*21:02.460- 21:08.560* :  but Marina of Janikovar had a captive audience when she entered the main new studio of Russian
*21:08.560- 21:13.960* :  state television stop the war was written on a placard she waived in front of the cameras
*21:13.960- 21:19.800* :  they're lying to you read another she also protested outside the Kremlin and a court has now
*21:19.800- 21:25.480* :  found her guilty of spreading false information about the Russian armed forces. In a statement
*21:25.480- 21:31.240* :  issued from abroad Miss Afsianikovar said they decided to flog me for not being afraid.
*21:32.060- 21:36.980* :  This year's Nobel Prize for Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists for their research
*21:36.980- 21:44.660* :  in tiny particles known as quantum dots that are used in LED lights and TV screens the laureates
*21:44.920- 21:51.240* :  the French-born Mungi Bawendi who is Bruce from the United States and Alexei Ekimov who grew up in
*21:51.240- 21:56.620* :  Russia all work in the US now. Our science correspondent Palab Gouche has been looking at their work.
*21:57.180- 22:03.720* :  As their name suggests quantum dots are extremely small typically the diameter of between 10
*22:03.720- 22:09.320* :  and 50 atoms their exact size determines the color of light they emit when given energy
*22:09.320- 22:15.240* :  it's blue at the smaller end becoming red at the larger sizes and all the colors in between
*22:15.340- 22:21.720* :  this property has been used to produce TV screens with more accurate color but their applications go
*22:21.720- 22:28.160* :  far beyond displays because changing sides at these atomic levels also changes the quantum dots
*22:28.160- 22:33.800* :  electrical magnetic and many other properties they're beginning to be used for more efficient solar
*22:33.800- 22:40.000* :  power cells information storage devices and they have the potential to be used to develop technologies
*22:40.000- 22:45.880* :  to deliver cancer drugs to specific organs without the side effects of whole body chemotherapy.
*22:46.740- 22:53.620* :  Palab Gouche in the 25 years since Frank Sinatra died there have been many tribute shows which
*22:53.620- 22:59.260* :  tried to recreate the stage presence and voice of a performer widely seen as one of popular
*22:59.260- 23:06.160* :  music's greats but the latest Sinatra the musical is different it recreates how the singer's
*23:06.160- 23:12.520* :  career took off in 1944 making him a star but eventually ending his marriage Vincent Daub.
*23:20.860- 23:26.480* :  This show is an attempt to tell on stage a chunk of Frank Sinatra's life.
*23:28.940- 23:38.240* :  I want to go play hide and seek there are songs but the plays honest about Sinatra's infidelities
*23:38.240- 23:45.380* :  as a husband so did Tina Sinatra hesitate to approve a candid script from writer Joe DePietro.
*23:45.700- 23:51.880* :  No I didn't and mom was alive when we first met and started to talk with Joe I don't remember
*23:51.880- 23:57.820* :  her ever thinking oh dear you can't do that that was not my mother the show's focus is the
*23:57.820- 24:04.180* :  married Sinatra's obsession with the Hollywood star who became his second wife Ava Gardner.
*24:04.380- 24:10.460* :  Yes it's Frank Sinatra and his wife Ava Gardner making a call on but I was tiny and grew up
*24:10.460- 24:17.100* :  into the situation kind of after the fact my mother never said a word about Ava nothing
*24:17.100- 24:23.620* :  favorable or disfavorable the mess was over and I would get to know Ava as a young adult and I
*24:23.620- 24:30.600* :  liked her very much and I'm glad to represent her because I don't think she's been well represented.
*24:30.620- 24:36.840* :  Matt other times on stage when you have to make it clear that at that point in the narrative
*24:37.300- 24:42.020* :  Frank is maybe not a nice guy what I know that we're doing here is telling a really honest story
*24:42.020- 24:47.080* :  and that's because of Tina's bravery and even if sometimes the audience might be uncomfortable
*24:47.080- 24:53.780* :  with Frank's choices they're watching how he became who he was. Matt Doyle last year a Tony winner
*24:53.780- 24:59.720* :  on Broadway sings some of Frank Sinatra's most famous songs with an 18 piece band.
*25:07.300- 25:13.140* :  But does he impersonate Sinatra's singing on stage? I think it's just a really important
*25:13.540- 25:18.540* :  balance listening to him and understanding his nuances and the diction it's almost like
*25:18.540- 25:23.980* :  training that as muscle memory and then just trusting that my voice has to tell the story.
*25:24.580- 25:38.740* :  Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore. You are all I long for, all I worship and adore.
*25:39.680- 25:47.200* :  Phoebe Paneratus plays Nancy Senior the first Mrs. Sinatra. He I think was an incredibly lonely man
*25:47.940- 25:53.040* :  he tended to his career with the most love and devotion and I think while that was
*25:53.240- 25:57.220* :  torturous for him it gave the rest of the world this gift that is Frank Sinatra and I think
*25:57.420- 26:03.700* :  Nancy always believed in him and I think she saw how great he could be and how great he was
*26:04.340- 26:10.360* :  to her detriment like she put herself second. The new show isn't afraid of dark periods in Frank
*26:10.360- 26:16.320* :  Sinatra's life but actor Matt Doyle and Tina Sinatra say it's also a celebration.
*26:16.740- 26:23.720* :  I think dad was the first in his form a pop artist and they were swimming for him and that's where
*26:23.720- 26:29.580* :  our story really kicks in emotionally. Frank used the lyric of the song. That's why everyone
*26:29.580- 26:34.080* :  talks about his phrasing is that he cared about the words that he was singing and that's what
*26:34.080- 26:38.240* :  you find when you're listening to him. You can emulate his sound, you can work on all the small
*26:38.240- 26:42.520* :  things but what made him who he was is that he was an actor first.
*26:42.520- 26:55.540* :  Because you make me feel so young. You make me feel so young. You make me feel so young.
*27:05.420- 27:09.240* :  And that's enough news spreading for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News
*27:09.240- 27:14.360* :  Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or as Frank would say be a part of it,

*27:32.600- 27:32.800* :  bye bye.
*27:41.520- 27:46.100* :  That world has enough and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*27:46.380- 27:52.720* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed like I'd never seen anything
*27:52.720- 27:58.840* :  like this. At the height of Abercrombian fit to success. This was me being carefully manipulated.
*27:58.840- 28:04.840* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that would take me
*28:04.840- 28:13.780* :  into a world of money, sex and power. This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie guys.
