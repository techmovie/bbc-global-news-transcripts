*00:29.180- 00:32.080* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:34.460- 00:39.440* :  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Sunday 15 October, these are our main stories.
*00:39.500- 00:44.320* :  The UN Humanitarian Chief says the situation for Palestinians in Gaza
*00:44.320- 00:50.280* :  is fast becoming untenable due to Israeli airstrikes and warnings of a ground offensive.
*00:50.940- 00:54.600* :  Israel says it's killed one of the key Hamas leaders behind last week's
*00:54.600- 00:56.240* :  huge assault on Israelis.
*00:56.960- 01:01.900* :  And Saudi Arabia is reported to have suspended talks on normalizing relations with Israel.
*01:04.680- 01:05.780* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:05.900- 01:12.700* :  for many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, this campaign has been a heavy
*01:12.700- 01:18.100* :  white to carry and this result will be very hard to bear.
*01:18.100- 01:23.580* :  Photos in Australia have overwhelmingly rejected a plan to give greater rights to the country's
*01:23.580- 01:26.120* :  indigenous people in a divisive referendum.
*01:30.280- 01:34.940* :  First, the United Nations says the situation in Gaza is becoming untenable.
*01:34.940- 01:39.100* :  The UN says nearly a million Palestinians there have now been displaced
*01:39.100- 01:43.860* :  due to airstrikes and Israel's warning that people should leave the north of Gaza.
*01:44.420- 01:49.160* :  It says there was no power, clean water or fuel and food supplies were running low.
*01:49.740- 01:52.620* :  The UN has urged the Israelis to end their siege of Gaza.
*01:53.080- 01:56.360* :  Israel has carried out a massive bombing campaign in the territory
*01:56.360- 01:58.900* :  since their Hamas attacks eight days ago.
*01:58.900- 02:03.260* :  Palestinian officials say more than 2,200 people have been killed.
*02:03.840- 02:06.860* :  Muhammad is among those who have fled south from Gaza City.
*02:28.900- 02:33.340* :  Well, the BBC has been getting voice notes from people in Gaza over the last few days.
*02:33.900- 02:38.460* :  Given the difficulties sometimes of getting through, this is a Gaza resident called Zina.
*02:39.500- 02:43.760* :  While I was on the way to the south, did you hear that? Did you hear that?
*02:46.640- 02:47.260* :  Did you hear that?
*02:50.900- 02:51.700* :  This is the bombing.
*02:53.400- 02:58.760* :  The Israeli military targeted civilians while they were moving to the south,
*02:59.520- 03:01.220* :  killing more than 70 people.
*03:03.160- 03:09.500* :  Thankfully, we managed to go to a house to a people we don't know, actually.
*03:10.320- 03:19.760* :  But like they were so generous, they were opening their doors to people so they can come into their
*03:19.760- 03:22.720* :  house and to sleep in it.
*03:23.340- 03:27.880* :  Medical staff in Gaza say hospitals there speak of unprecedented challenges.
*03:28.540- 03:32.020* :  Mahmoud Shalabi works for the aid group medical aid for Palestinians.
*03:32.780- 03:37.840* :  Exempted pain killers aren't even provided inside the hospital and patients are actually
*03:37.840- 03:44.980* :  filling the corridors of the hospital. Being killed on those circumstances is way better than
*03:44.980- 03:50.320* :  getting one. When you die, you will lose your life in a split of a second.
*03:50.780- 03:53.660* :  But if you are wounded in these circumstances, you are going to suffer.
*03:54.260- 03:58.440* :  A correspondent, Rusty Abu al-Aluf, is in Khan Unis in southern Gaza.
*03:59.020- 04:03.720* :  I had to take the journey from Gaza into southern city of Khan Unis.
*04:04.040- 04:10.300* :  After the Israeli army asked all the people living in Gaza City where I used to live and in the north
*04:10.580- 04:17.880* :  to go south. I am in Khan Unis since yesterday and the scene that I witnessed is really tragic.
*04:17.880- 04:24.940* :  People are sleeping in the public spaces. Hundreds of thousands of people are deployed to the schools.
*04:24.940- 04:31.320* :  I am in the hospital. The main hospital in Khan Unis also hundreds of people are taking the hospital
*04:31.320- 04:38.380* :  as a refugee. Suddenly this city has to accommodate three and three half a million people.
*04:38.380- 04:46.900* :  This place from their northern and middle area, Gaza City and as the Hamas officially said about
*04:46.900- 04:56.220* :  400,000 people, they took this journey yesterday and today more than a million people in this city
*04:56.900- 05:02.520* :  and people, the local authority here is struggling to find accommodation for the people to find
*05:02.520- 05:08.880* :  essential need, water is running out. That is the BBC's Rusty Abu al-Aluf who has moved south
*05:08.880- 05:15.540* :  from his home in Gaza City to Khan Unis. To find out more about the humanitarian situation in Gaza,
*05:16.000- 05:20.780* :  my colleague Andrew Peach has been talking to Lynn Elizabeth Hastings. She's the UN's deputy
*05:20.780- 05:26.540* :  special coordinator for Gaza but is unable to get there at the moment so she is currently in Jerusalem.
*05:27.340- 05:32.820* :  Good word to describe it is catastrophic and likely to get worse now because there's no
*05:32.820- 05:39.000* :  communications. It's very difficult for us to be monitoring with our colleagues. In addition,
*05:39.000- 05:44.540* :  there was an order by the government of Israel requiring approximately one million people who
*05:44.540- 05:51.420* :  live in the north of Gaza to move to the south within 24 hours. Literally one million people
*05:51.420- 05:58.900* :  to move in 24 hours of course is largely impossible. The United Nations is calling for a ceasefire
*05:58.900- 06:06.160* :  and that's really the solution. The solution is not to destroy Gaza entirely so the civilian population
*06:06.160- 06:13.600* :  has nothing to return to. Israelis are concerned about the hostages that are being held in Gaza
*06:13.600- 06:18.320* :  and would also say they have every right to defend themselves from the attacks a week ago.
*06:18.320- 06:24.980* :  What do you say to that? The UN has condemned the events of last week. They were horrific
*06:25.720- 06:31.780* :  and we have called on the release of the hostages immediately and unconditionally.
*06:31.780- 06:35.520* :  But they're just words. They're not going to get the hostages released. Well, we don't know that.
*06:35.520- 06:42.480* :  There are a lot of efforts to get the hostages out. We are also calling for humanitarian assistance
*06:42.480- 06:49.660* :  to be unconditional. Both issues are humanitarian and one very central principle of humanitarian
*06:49.660- 06:56.000* :  law is that it is delivered unconditionally. What do you think of the images we're seeing today
*06:56.000- 07:01.700* :  of Hamas trying to stop people from leaving? Not everyone wants to leave. Hamas doesn't want people
*07:01.700- 07:06.140* :  to leave and they're blocking the road. People should be able to flee if they want to,
*07:06.140- 07:10.880* :  just as they should be able to stay in their homes if they want to without threat of bombardment.
*07:11.160- 07:14.420* :  Is it not better that people are moving because it's going to save lives?
*07:15.140- 07:21.840* :  What we say about Gaza is there's really no safe place regardless of whether or not you stay or you move.
*07:22.220- 07:25.580* :  Tell me a bit about the work you're trying to do on water and other essential supplies.
*07:26.340- 07:33.560* :  We have probably close to 350,000 people in shelters in about 92 shelters, which actually
*07:33.660- 07:40.480* :  50 of them are not equipped to be shelters. But in any event water is always in short supply
*07:40.480- 07:44.500* :  and part of that reason is because most of the water needs to be desalinated.
*07:44.500- 07:51.680* :  The Israelis cut off both the electricity and the water, which means that even if there was water,
*07:51.680- 07:58.800* :  there's no electricity for the desalination plants to run, which means the water is running out and
*07:58.800- 08:06.120* :  it will probably run out in the next two days. What we're seeing is of course is an entire collapse
*08:06.120- 08:12.840* :  of the health system at a time when you have so many people who are injured and need
*08:14.060- 08:19.240* :  of medical attention and operations. There's no refrigerators, so food,
*08:19.320- 08:24.840* :  spoils, and then when you have a situation with this lack of water, never mind not being able to
*08:24.840- 08:30.480* :  drink it, it really raises questions of hygiene and the outbreak of various diseases.
*08:30.980- 08:35.060* :  Do you think Egypt is doing enough to help people who want to get out of Gaza?
*08:35.500- 08:42.480* :  We are working with Egypt in terms of trying to get people out and trying to find solutions.
*08:42.640- 08:48.720* :  I do think that Egypt, like it or not, Gaza is on their border and it is in their best interest to
*08:48.720- 08:57.000* :  make sure people in Gaza are able to live a productive and perhaps even one day a joyful life.
*08:57.780- 09:02.040* :  Lynn Elizabeth Hastings, the UN's deputy special coordinator for Gaza.
*09:03.080- 09:07.320* :  The Israeli military says it has killed a Hamas commander who led part of last week's
*09:07.320- 09:13.820* :  incursion in which 1300 Israelis were killed. Ali Kadi is the second Hamas chief to have been
*09:13.820- 09:19.440* :  killed in a day. He died in a drone strike. Earlier, the Israeli military said it had killed the head
*09:19.440- 09:25.920* :  of Hamas' aerial operations, Murad Abu Murad. He said to have played a significant part in directing
*09:25.920- 09:31.540* :  the attack on Israeli civilians last Saturday. Meanwhile, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*09:31.780- 09:37.540* :  has visited troops near the border with Gaza. Video footage shows Mr. Netanyahu wearing a bullet
*09:37.540- 09:43.360* :  proof vest, talking to heavily armed soldiers, as he visited two of the kabut settlements targeted
*09:43.360- 09:49.700* :  by Hamas. A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Force is known as the IDF. Lieutenant Colonel Peter
*09:49.700- 09:57.440* :  Lerner said Israel was adhering to international rules. Our obligation is to work and operate within
*09:58.400- 10:03.340* :  the laws of armed conflict, that is our framework of operation as a professional military,
*10:03.980- 10:11.480* :  and we are doing everything in accordance to the law and in order to implement our directive,
*10:11.480- 10:19.180* :  our mission to remove Hamas as the terrorist organization that leads Gaza. So I would say it's a
*10:19.180- 10:25.500* :  combination of the need, the military necessity, on one hand, balancing the civilian needs,
*10:25.500- 10:30.100* :  the humanitarian needs, and indeed that is why we're telling people you have to go south.
*10:30.640- 10:36.160* :  The IDF has spent much of the past week maneuvering tanks, artillery and infantry units into position
*10:36.160- 10:41.480* :  in the south of the country near the border with Gaza. Later on Saturday, it released a statement
*10:41.480- 10:47.220* :  giving more details about its possible ground offensive into Gaza. I heard more from our
*10:47.220- 10:51.680* :  Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman who's in Jerusalem. This is probably, I think, the most
*10:51.680- 10:56.900* :  detailed statement that we've seen from the Israeli military about what they're doing, the
*10:56.900- 11:02.320* :  forces that are being amassed around the Gaza perimeter. So they talk about, I mean, the fighting
*11:02.320- 11:08.780* :  obviously that's already taken place since the Hamas attacks a week ago and how it took some time
*11:08.840- 11:14.820* :  for the fighting there to reach a point where they felt they had cleared the area. But now they
*11:14.820- 11:20.700* :  say what they describe as a critical juncture. So the Israeli military is gearing up for what they
*11:20.700- 11:27.540* :  call a comprehensive offensive and say that their plans encompass a synchronized multifaceted
*11:27.540- 11:33.880* :  offensive involving air, sea and land assets. Now they then go on to talk about how there is a
*11:34.060- 11:39.680* :  big logistics operation to potentially expand the area of combat and quite a lot of work being done
*11:39.680- 11:46.520* :  to basically get kit and ammunition to the front line. But I think what this says is they feel
*11:47.340- 11:53.360* :  almost in a point where they are ready. And I think that matches what we saw from Benjamin Netanyahu
*11:53.360- 11:59.320* :  wearing a flak jacket, visiting soldiers on the perimeter there. And as you said,
*11:59.320- 12:05.080* :  asking if they were ready telling them that the future as he described it is on its way. So it
*12:05.080- 12:11.000* :  feels like this thing is probably now fairly imminent. Whether that means hours or days is still
*12:11.060- 12:15.800* :  harder to tell because there have still been messages from the military about the sort of
*12:15.800- 12:20.540* :  expandability of the deadlines they've been giving Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to flee their
*12:20.540- 12:26.040* :  homes. Tom Bateman talking to me from Jerusalem. The US government has advised its citizens in
*12:26.040- 12:32.520* :  Gaza to move south towards the RAFA crossing with Egypt. The only entry and exit to Gaza that is
*12:32.520- 12:38.040* :  not controlled by Israel has been closed since the Palestinian side was hit by an Israeli air strike
*12:38.040- 12:43.140* :  on Tuesday. A State Department spokesman said US citizens should be ready at the crossing
*12:43.540- 12:48.720* :  where it's possible reopening as there may be little notice and crossings may be for a very
*12:48.720- 12:54.700* :  limited time. Let's go north now to the border between Israel and Lebanon. We are repeatedly
*12:54.700- 13:00.460* :  reporting from this area because there's constant concern that it may be where another front
*13:00.460- 13:06.160* :  opens in the conflict between Israel and neighboring militants. In this area it is Hezbollah,
*13:06.160- 13:12.300* :  an organization close to Iran but also one regarded as a terrorist organization by both the US and
*13:12.300- 13:17.920* :  the Arab League that is considering whether it wants to enter the war. Since Hamas launched its
*13:17.920- 13:23.520* :  assault on Israel just over a week ago, there have been sporadic attacks across Israel's border
*13:23.520- 13:27.600* :  with Lebanon. I heard more from our correspondent Anna Foster who's in the area.
*13:28.380- 13:32.200* :  It is incredibly tense and actually the sort of thing that we've seen in the last few days
*13:32.200- 13:37.740* :  at any other time would have been a real topic of conversation. It is a huge escalation that we've
*13:37.740- 13:43.120* :  seen that along this border it is nothing compared to what would happen if Hezbollah decided to try and
*13:43.120- 13:48.560* :  open up a new northern front in this war but these regular exchanges of fire that we're seeing
*13:48.560- 13:54.000* :  in the early hours of this morning we saw some men come across the border from the Lebanese side
*13:54.000- 14:00.940* :  to the Israeli side. They were fired on by Israeli forces. We've seen 30 mortars fired across
*14:00.940- 14:07.300* :  the border again from Lebanon into Israel today. We've seen an Israeli response day after day here
*14:07.300- 14:12.660* :  on the northern border. We are seeing these exchanges of fire that are very unusual and people are
*14:12.660- 14:18.520* :  questioning whether that is a precursor to this conflict spreading north and an opening up
*14:18.840- 14:24.540* :  a new front which would be catastrophic not just for Israel for Lebanon but for the whole of the
*14:24.540- 14:28.100* :  Middle East. And just to be clear as well, you've mentioned a limited but nonetheless an
*14:28.100- 14:33.220* :  incursion by militant fighters coming across the border to Israel. That's happening, is it?
*14:33.380- 14:38.840* :  It is. It's happened a couple of times this week. It's in small numbers two or three each time
*14:39.300- 14:43.520* :  but the fact that they are getting across that border wall in the north. We saw a couple of days
*14:43.520- 14:49.480* :  ago there were Israeli defence force members that actually engage them and in fact two Israeli
*14:49.480- 14:53.700* :  soldiers, two to three Israeli soldiers were killed. We do know that one of them was a very
*14:53.700- 14:59.140* :  senior Israeli soldier. So it is happening. You know, part of this is fire and part of this are
*14:59.140- 15:04.280* :  individuals coming across the border not in the numbers that we saw of course coming out of Gaza
*15:04.280- 15:09.280* :  breaking through the perimeter fence and coming into southern Israel from Gaza. But nonetheless,
*15:09.280- 15:15.140* :  we are seeing as well as that fire, we are seeing individuals from Palestinian Islamic
*15:15.140- 15:20.780* :  Jihad and Hezbollah. We're seeing that sort of constant consistent engagement here on the northern
*15:20.840- 15:25.720* :  border. But also in terms of where you are, what you've seen, the people you may have spoken to
*15:25.720- 15:30.300* :  in the time you've been there. Are there civilians, Israeli people who are moving out?
*15:30.820- 15:35.520* :  Are they taking measures and anticipation of some kind of military escalation there?
*15:35.720- 15:40.440* :  The vast majority actually are moving out. The communities that we've been to, those who can
*15:40.540- 15:46.260* :  are leaving. We were in one small town called Shlomi yesterday, population of about 8,000
*15:46.260- 15:52.400* :  and three quarters of them have left already. Of those that are left, others are packing their
*15:52.400- 15:58.240* :  bags and preparing to leave. Anna Foster speaking to me from close to the Israel Lebanon border.
*15:59.200- 16:03.320* :  Now, there appears to be a significant diplomatic development today from Saudi Arabia
*16:03.760- 16:09.200* :  in the aftermath of Israel's retaliation against Hamas. Readd is reported to have suspended
*16:09.200- 16:14.660* :  discussions on the possible normalization of ties with Israel. The decision is said to have been
*16:14.660- 16:19.920* :  taken on the same day the U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, met his Saudi counterpart
*16:19.920- 16:27.080* :  in the latest stop on his 48-hour tour of the Middle East. So what is normalization and why,
*16:27.080- 16:33.300* :  for some, would it be so important to the future of Israel and Saudi Arabia? That's a question I
*16:33.300- 16:39.160* :  put to our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson. Up until now, well, in fact, as we speak,
*16:39.160- 16:45.740* :  Saudi Arabia has no diplomatic relations with Israel. So no embassy in each other's
*16:46.120- 16:52.720* :  capitals, so no formal ties at all. So that's what's meant by normalizing, you say, well, most
*16:52.720- 16:58.460* :  countries do talk diplomatically and do have embassies in each other's countries. So that is what
*16:58.460- 17:03.320* :  will happen if this normalization deal eventually happens. But at the moment, it would appear that
*17:03.540- 17:08.540* :  because of the event of the last week that Saudi Arabia is stepping back and putting the process
*17:08.540- 17:12.220* :  that's been going on, mostly behind the scenes on hold, is that where we are now?
*17:12.640- 17:18.640* :  It is indeed, yes, Saudi has been quite outspoken about what it sees on the mass displacement
*17:18.640- 17:26.860* :  of Palestinians and attacks on what it calls defenseless civilians. Up to now, it hasn't said much
*17:26.860- 17:31.540* :  other than urge restraint, but that was quite telling. And at the moment, of course, US Secretary
*17:31.540- 17:39.220* :  of State, Anthony Blinken is touring the region. He's been in Saudi earlier today, and he was
*17:39.220- 17:45.480* :  really hoping that they would be on side both to help the region get together, principally actually,
*17:45.480- 17:52.100* :  as a bulwark against Hamas and Iran. But this sort of situation obviously hasn't been helping.
*17:52.480- 17:57.460* :  Is it your assessment that this is a move coming out of Riyadh because it feels compelled to do this,
*17:57.820- 18:01.580* :  or it genuinely wants to use this as a way of expressing its dissatisfaction with what's going
*18:01.580- 18:07.780* :  on? And does it, I suppose most importantly, mean that this normalization process now is frozen,
*18:07.900- 18:14.460* :  or is it a postponement, or what is it? I think it's suspended. I think eventually it should still
*18:15.180- 18:19.620* :  proceed again, but the problem for Arab leaders at the moment, if you take Saudi, for instance,
*18:20.320- 18:25.160* :  amongst the Saudi population as in many other Arab countries, however the governments feel,
*18:25.600- 18:30.980* :  pragmatically about trying to get on with Israel, a lot of the population is outraged about what
*18:30.980- 18:35.340* :  they're seeing, what's happening in Gaza, and it really at the moment would be pretty much
*18:35.340- 18:42.100* :  untenable for Saudi to now establish diplomatic relations with Israel at a point like this.
*18:42.780- 18:47.400* :  Mike Thompson, over the last week we've tried to bring you a cross-section of eyewitness testimony
*18:47.400- 18:52.040* :  from both sides of this conflict. Many of the interviews have been harrowing.
*18:52.640- 18:58.280* :  Events started when Hamas launched its attack on Israel eight days ago on a Saturday morning.
*18:58.280- 19:03.140* :  Some of the first victims of those attacks were young people who were at the supernova festival,
*19:03.140- 19:09.120* :  not far from the border with Gaza. More than 260 bodies were then subsequently recovered from
*19:09.120- 19:14.880* :  the festival site. Sharon is a 22-year-old Israeli photographer who was working at the festival.
*19:15.340- 19:20.080* :  She told my colleague Matthew Amroly Waller what she witnessed, and I must stress that some of
*19:20.080- 19:25.420* :  the following is a difficult lesson. The day that I got to the festival, I got there with two
*19:25.420- 19:34.240* :  friends from Facebook that gave me a lift to the festival, and all night I spent taking photos of
*19:34.240- 19:43.160* :  beautiful people with beautiful music, so many colorful humans, and as the sun started to rise up,
*19:43.900- 19:49.140* :  I remember that I went back a few steps from the main stage, and I tried to take a shoot
*19:49.500- 19:58.640* :  of the sunrise above the main stage, and then the music stopped. I look up at the sky and
*19:58.640- 20:05.800* :  see that everything is lit up, like fireworks, bombs and rockets above our heads, people are screaming
*20:05.800- 20:14.180* :  and crying, and terror, not knowing what's up and what's going to happen next. I remember that I
*20:14.180- 20:21.260* :  went to the backstage to take my belongings and go and find my friends to go back home with.
*20:22.260- 20:28.100* :  I remember that I begged them to say that we will hide underneath the car from the bombs, and they
*20:28.100- 20:35.800* :  said, no, let's go. I got into the car and we started driving. As we were driving, black smoke
*20:35.800- 20:42.500* :  covered all the area, and we heard bombs getting closer and closer. We heard gunshots, but we didn't
*20:42.500- 20:49.620* :  understand what was going on. I know that you told our producer that in those initial moments,
*20:49.820- 20:53.940* :  you of course hid, and then you got into the car, and then you started driving, and you said to our
*20:53.940- 21:01.320* :  producer, you know now that if you stayed one minute, two minutes more that you two would have been
*21:01.320- 21:09.060* :  killed here. The second that we got on the road, the shooting started on the left side of the road.
*21:10.260- 21:16.960* :  We turned right, and they turned left, all the people that went left got slaughtered. As we were
*21:16.960- 21:23.120* :  driving right, we went, we drove and we saw shelters on the side of the roads with so many people
*21:23.120- 21:29.020* :  inside of them. And again, I asked the driver to stop to get into the shelter, because that's the
*21:29.020- 21:35.100* :  thing that makes the most sense in that situation. And instead of getting into the shelter, my driver
*21:35.100- 21:40.760* :  decided to keep on going and just drive home, and about two minutes after that, we heard
*21:40.760- 21:48.480* :  booms as strong as hell could imagine behind us, because the terrorists got to the
*21:48.480- 21:54.480* :  shelters and they bombed them with grenades. When we got to the highway, there was a police car that
*21:54.480- 22:00.180* :  pulled up behind us and put up a barrier, and apparently those were terrorists too. The things that
*22:00.180- 22:05.200* :  happened in this music festival are beyond a stick and a stick of all. They have friends that
*22:05.200- 22:12.180* :  didn't come home yet. They have friends that seem things so terrible. I can see how upsetting,
*22:12.220- 22:20.540* :  how raw it still feels. We're only seven days from all of this, and I know you took so many photographs
*22:21.540- 22:28.060* :  at the time from that festival. Have you started to look at them? Can you look at them?
*22:28.280- 22:32.940* :  In the first two days, the government reached out to the photographers from the festival,
*22:32.940- 22:39.680* :  and they asked us for the photos to recognize bodies. And I tried the best that I could to go back
*22:39.680- 22:47.120* :  and help from where I could. So I went to the photos and I couldn't. After a hundred faces,
*22:47.120- 22:52.860* :  I just couldn't anymore. I gave the camera to a friend and told them to upload the photos.
*22:54.000- 22:59.540* :  So the answer is no. A week went past the incident and I can't look at the photos because
*22:59.540- 23:06.100* :  I don't know. I don't know who's alive and who's dead. And when you look at the situation now,
*23:07.120- 23:15.400* :  we have all the signals suggesting there's going to be a massive response in terms of a ground
*23:15.400- 23:23.480* :  incursion, all of that. What are your thoughts in terms of just broadly what the response should be?
*23:24.180- 23:33.300* :  I think my own opinion does not matter. I think that the people that are in charge are taking
*23:33.300- 23:41.880* :  the best, the best decisions they can right now. I want peace. I want people to feel safe in
*23:41.880- 23:48.620* :  their homes. I want people to feel safe in their countries. And I just hope safety will reach us all.
*23:50.080- 23:55.360* :  That was Sharon and is really photographer who was at the Supernova Festival, speaking to my
*23:55.360- 24:01.100* :  colleague Matthew and Molly Waller. Okay, still to come.
*24:07.780- 24:13.040* :  Oh my goodness. It is a gorgeous sight to be old.
*24:13.520- 24:17.800* :  Millions of people in the Americas catch a glimpse of a dramatic solar eclipse.

*24:59.100- 25:03.060* :  What in the world is the podcast helping you make sense of what's happening in the world?
*25:03.220- 25:06.540* :  What in the world is net zero and are we actually on track to achieving it?

*25:11.880- 25:16.420* :  going on when you read the daily headlines. Why is there a North Korea and a South Korea?

*25:28.960- 25:34.900* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Voters in Australia have overwhelmingly rejected a plan
*25:34.900- 25:41.340* :  to give greater rights to the country's indigenous people in a divisive referendum. All six states
*25:41.340- 25:46.620* :  voted no to the proposal. It would have changed Australia's constitution, which is more than a
*25:46.620- 25:52.280* :  century old and created a body to advise the federal government. Katie Watson reports from Sydney.
*25:53.040- 25:57.600* :  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised this referendum as a way to unite Australia,
*25:57.600- 26:03.280* :  but in what was often a bruising campaign, it did just the opposite. It was not the result he had
*26:03.280- 26:10.220* :  hoped for. For many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, this campaign has been a heavy
*26:10.220- 26:20.040* :  weight to carry, and this result will be very hard to bear. So many remarkable indigenous Australians
*26:21.520- 26:27.460* :  have put their heart and soul into this cause, not just over the past few weeks and months,
*26:27.460- 26:35.240* :  but through decades, indeed lifetimes of advocacy. This referendum has made clear the need for
*26:35.240- 26:40.740* :  Australia to find ways to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and reduce
*26:40.740- 26:47.040* :  inequalities they face in education, health and poverty. But it has also forced Australians to reflect
*26:47.040- 26:52.840* :  on their country's colonial legacy, how to move forward despite an often violent history
*26:53.280- 26:59.740* :  and to forge a different future. That work set to continue no doubt with uncomfortable conversations
*26:59.820- 27:04.800* :  ahead. Katie Watson, major tourist attractions in the French capital have been
*27:04.800- 27:10.660* :  evacuated because of security fears. The fatal stabbing of a schoolteacher on Friday has prompted
*27:10.660- 27:16.080* :  the authorities there to deploy thousands of soldiers to carry out patrols. The government has
*27:16.080- 27:20.340* :  suggested a link to events in Gaza and Israel. Hugh Schofield has more.
*27:20.920- 27:26.480* :  Nerves are fraught over the risk of Middle East violence spilling into France. So when there was
*27:26.480- 27:31.460* :  an anonymous bomb warning at the Louvre today, the place was evacuated. A few hours later,
*27:31.460- 27:36.120* :  the same thing happened at the Palace of Versailles. Their two visitors were told to leave.
*27:36.780- 27:41.240* :  Yesterday's deadly knife attack in Erass was a brutal reminder to the country of its own
*27:41.240- 27:46.800* :  recent history of Islamist violence. The big fear now is that if Palestinian death counts
*27:46.800- 27:52.100* :  rise dramatically after Israel moves into Gaza, then there could be reprisal attacks against
*27:52.100- 27:57.860* :  Jewish or other targets here in France. Hugh Schofield reporting from Paris, a change of pace now
*27:57.860- 28:04.100* :  because the British actor Michael Cain has announced he's retiring from acting at the age of 90.
*28:04.580- 28:09.040* :  Born into a working-class family in South London, the film star went on to appear in more than
*28:09.040- 28:16.280* :  160 films over an eight-decade long career. The last of which of those movies has just been released.
*28:16.280- 28:27.500* :  Here's Paul Moss. He made his name playing tough guys and charmers like the Lothario Alfie.
*28:32.320- 28:34.760* :  And there was the vengeful brother in Get Carter.
*28:39.400- 28:44.020* :  He was also a soldier in Zulu and a secret agent in the Black Windmill.
*28:44.020- 28:49.320* :  But later life saw Michael Cain display new found versatility with roles like the
*28:49.320- 28:55.680* :  smitten professor in educating Rita. Yet through all these, he often shows parts which reflected his
*28:55.680- 29:01.420* :  working-class roots. He was among a cohort of post-war performers refusing to adopt the
*29:01.420- 29:07.360* :  traditional plummy tones of British Thespians. And that continues in his latest film, The Great
*29:07.360- 29:12.900* :  Escaper. Though playing at long retired soldier seems to be what persuaded Sir Michael,
*29:13.340- 29:18.440* :  it was time to quit. The only parts I'm not going to get now are old men. And I thought,
*29:18.440- 29:23.360* :  well, I might as well leave with all this. I've got wonderful reviews. What am I going to do to
*29:23.360- 29:29.520* :  beat this? The answer, apparently, is to start a new career. At the age of 90, Sir Michael Cain has
*29:29.520- 29:35.240* :  written his first novel. It's the story of a London detective chasing Colombian gangsters.
*29:35.800- 29:40.620* :  Just the sort of character he himself might once have played. Paul Moss are Michael Cain.
*29:41.440- 29:45.940* :  Millions of people in the Americas have been catching a glimpse of an annular solar eclipse.
*29:45.940- 29:51.820* :  The spectacular event has been visible in parts of the U.S., Mexico, Central and South America.
*29:52.280- 29:57.480* :  These two broadcasters from the American Space Agency NASA witnessed it along with crowns in
*29:57.480- 29:58.020* :  New Mexico.
*30:04.580- 30:04.740* :  Wow.
*30:04.760- 30:05.380* :  Wow.
*30:06.220- 30:07.820* :  We're in, oh my goodness.
*30:08.140- 30:09.980* :  It is a gorgeous sight to behold.
*30:10.160- 30:12.800* :  Everyone is cheering. This is so amazing.
*30:15.080- 30:15.440* :  Wow.
*30:17.420- 30:22.260* :  Well, our America's original editor, Lina and Arotcha, has more on this celestial event.
*30:23.140- 30:27.340* :  Some people have been preparing for months for the occasion. Families have traveled to where
*30:27.340- 30:32.580* :  the probability of finding clear skies was higher, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile,
*30:32.580- 30:38.500* :  the north of Brazil, or the south of the United States. The whole event lasts no longer than five
*30:38.500- 30:44.240* :  minutes, but those who have witnessed it were in awe of the spectacle. The event is called
*30:44.240- 30:50.360* :  an annular eclipse, because the moon blocks out most of the sun, living a thing ring or annulus
*30:50.360- 30:56.220* :  of light. Lina and Arotcha, now let's hand on a music legend. One of the most famous names in
*30:56.220- 31:01.220* :  pop music, Madonna, has just launched her latest world tour here in London. And you won't need
*31:01.220- 31:06.080* :  to sit through new material because it's greatest hits only. It nearly didn't happen, though,
*31:06.080- 31:10.980* :  because the 65-year-old felt seriously ill just a few months ago. Our music correspondent,
*31:10.980- 31:16.080* :  Mark Savage, spoke to her longtime musical director Stuart Price ahead of the opening night.
*31:22.720- 31:24.020* :  40 years of music.
*31:30.280- 31:34.600* :  13 UK number one singles and 72 top 40 hits.
*31:38.360- 31:42.020* :  Hi, do you squeeze all of that into one to our concert?
*31:42.340- 31:46.400* :  So that is a big challenge. And the answer is, you try and pick all the stuff that serves the
*31:53.740- 31:58.700* :  story best. Stuart says the show will have a documentary aspect, telling Madonna's story
*31:58.700- 32:05.260* :  through her music and her archive. Everything from, I think, being a young woman in New York,
*32:06.180- 32:10.460* :  all the way through motherhood, spiritual awakenings, the ups and downs.
*32:15.460- 32:20.680* :  This is the first concert Madonna gave after she signed a record deal in New York in 1983.
*32:21.620- 32:27.260* :  From those humble beginnings, she has revolutionized the presentation of live music with lavish
*32:27.360- 32:34.480* :  and innovative stages. Stuart says the new concert won't be an exception.
*32:34.980- 32:38.480* :  Probably for the first time, there's not a band in the traditional sense.
*32:38.880- 32:41.780* :  There are live musicians that perform at different parts of the show.
*32:44.960- 32:49.340* :  What we realize is that the original recordings in a lot of senses are stars of the show.
*32:49.600- 32:56.540* :  Madonna, I dare you to do a world tour and play your greatest hits.
*32:57.520- 33:00.600* :  Four decades? That's a lot of songs. You think people would come to that show?
*33:00.780- 33:05.240* :  I'll be there. Madonna announced her celebration tour with this YouTube video in January.
*33:05.340- 33:07.160* :  Okay, so the answer is, yeah.
*33:08.300- 33:12.560* :  rehearsals started in April. Day one, hell week.
*33:14.040- 33:18.220* :  But in June, she was rushed to hospital with a serious bacterial infection.
*33:18.300- 33:21.900* :  The opening night of the concert was delayed by three months.
*33:22.260- 33:26.600* :  Madonna has very high expectations of how much hard work people will put into something.
*33:26.600- 33:32.140* :  It's very uncompromising in that sense, but she's as hard on herself as well.
*33:32.160- 33:36.300* :  The person that is going to take the stage and perform this looks incredible.
*33:36.680- 33:39.280* :  Sounds incredible. It's performance incredible as well.
*33:40.200- 33:42.360* :  The proof will come with the opening show in London.
*33:49.700- 33:54.340* :  The rest of the world tour is projected to make more than 100 million pounds at the box office.
*34:00.100- 34:04.140* :  Mark Savage reporting on Madonna who at the age of 65 is back.
*34:06.840- 34:11.060* :  That's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later.
*34:11.060- 34:15.220* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*34:15.220- 34:19.600* :  including maybe how you can do a piece of Michael Cain and not talk about the Italian job,
*34:19.900- 34:24.280* :  well, you can send us an email. The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*34:24.280- 34:29.060* :  You can also find us on x, formerly known as twitter, at global news pod.
*34:29.060- 34:33.220* :  This edition was mixed by Jonathan Greer, the producer as ever, was Liam McChefrey,
*34:33.540- 34:36.800* :  the editor Karen Martin. I'm Robin Brandt, until next time, goodbye.
