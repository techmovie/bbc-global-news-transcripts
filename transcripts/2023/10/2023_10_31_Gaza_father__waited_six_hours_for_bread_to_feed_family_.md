*00:33.680- 00:38.760* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 31st of October, these are our main stories.
*00:38.760- 00:43.640* :  Israel says it forces a striking Hamas targets in all parts of Gaza,
*00:44.200- 00:48.880* :  but as people in Gaza are weight more aid, our correspondent there tells us even getting bread is a
*00:48.880- 00:55.840* :  struggle. Also in this podcast, striking clothing factory workers of block roads
*00:55.840- 01:01.800* :  and smashed up factories in Bangladesh. King Charles is in Kenya where he's expected to acknowledge
*01:01.800- 01:08.340* :  the painful aspects of colonial rule and so if your goal is to perform well at work and you become
*01:08.340- 01:13.760* :  angry at obstacles to that performance, it can actually motivate you to help overcome whatever
*01:13.760- 01:17.900* :  those obstacles are and do better. The benefits of losing your core.
*01:21.200- 01:27.040* :  We are making slow and meticulous progress. Those are the latest guarded comments from the
*01:27.040- 01:31.740* :  Israeli authorities about the gradual forward movements of its troops inside Gaza.
*01:32.460- 01:36.680* :  What's clear now is that at least some Israeli troops seem to be remaining in the
*01:36.680- 01:42.920* :  strip rather than returning to Israel between raids. Israeli war jets have struck hundreds of
*01:42.920- 01:49.380* :  targets in Gaza and Israeli defense forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conrikus
*01:49.820- 01:54.400* :  stressed the military focus was on Hamas, not the civilian Palestinian population.
*01:54.980- 02:01.120* :  We will focus our activities on the northern part of Gaza, that is the center of gravity of Hamas
*02:01.120- 02:05.900* :  and that is where we are attacking now. We continue to strike in other parts of Gaza, we are
*02:05.900- 02:10.920* :  hunting their commanders, we are attacking their infrastructure and whenever there is an important
*02:10.920- 02:18.080* :  target that is related to Hamas we strike it. Now we do so with professionalism. Hamas is the
*02:18.080- 02:24.860* :  enemy, not the civilian population and we focus our military efforts on Hamas. I got an update on
*02:24.860- 02:29.720* :  the military activities from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda. We've actually been able to
*02:29.720- 02:34.920* :  see from the south of Israel footage coming in live pictures of Israeli war planes bombing
*02:34.920- 02:39.920* :  the north of the Gaza strip plumes of grey smoke growing up from there. The Israeli military says
*02:39.920- 02:45.380* :  it's hit 300 targets in the last day and Israeli military spokesman also saying that there
*02:45.380- 02:50.840* :  have been strikes elsewhere in the Gaza strip and that ground troops who are now been for four
*02:50.840- 02:57.440* :  nights inside Gaza that they are slowly and meticulously moving on. Meanwhile we heard from
*02:57.440- 03:03.340* :  Hamas fighters that they said they had ambushed three Israeli vehicles firing anti-tank missiles.
*03:03.820- 03:09.220* :  At the same time conditions in Gaza are deteriorating fast. Washington says it's hopeful the number
*03:09.220- 03:15.900* :  of aid trucks entering Gaza will soon increase to around 100 a day. But aid agencies say the
*03:15.900- 03:22.020* :  humanitarian situation is already catastrophic. A correspondent Rushdie Abu Alouf is in Han Yunus
*03:22.020- 03:27.000* :  in southern Gaza. Over my time this morning the fighting was intensified in the north
*03:27.000- 03:32.720* :  west of Gaza strip. It's one of the four areas that Israel started the ground encarging into the
*03:32.840- 03:38.560* :  northern and Gaza city part. We understand from people till living the area that there was a heavy
*03:38.560- 03:45.040* :  fighting heavy gunfire and Israeli was shielding the place from sea air and land from the ground
*03:45.040- 03:51.020* :  troops. This is one direction of the fighting. The rest of Gaza strip there was continuous Israeli
*03:51.020- 03:56.440* :  airstrike over my tea and Han Yunus after one of the quietest nights last night this morning the
*03:56.440- 04:02.480* :  Israeli airstrike resumed and they have targeted four areas around the Han Yunus but the main focus
*04:02.480- 04:08.020* :  of the Israeli operation is in Gaza city and north where Israel announced the expanding its
*04:08.020- 04:14.380* :  military operation. Also this morning airstrikes were around the al-Quds hospital. It's the hospital
*04:14.380- 04:20.180* :  that Israel insists and keep calling the director that they have to evacuate the place. There is
*04:20.180- 04:26.080* :  about 14,000 people. They are taking the hospital as shelter and about 100 patients are being treated
*04:26.080- 04:31.680* :  there eight or ten of them according to the director of the hospital are connected to the life
*04:31.980- 04:38.280* :  machines and they said it's invisible to move all of this refugee and the patient and the people
*04:38.280- 04:44.960* :  who are critically injured to other place. In terms of getting water and basic food how are people
*04:44.960- 04:49.760* :  getting that now and where do they get it from? Well look the Han Yunus they have some
*04:49.880- 04:55.680* :  agricultural area where they still can harvest some tomatoes and some cucumber I saw them
*04:55.680- 05:00.500* :  selling in the market this morning. The real issue is the bread. People are queuing for six
*05:00.500- 05:06.780* :  eight hours to get very little amount of bread. A father who lived next to me in a tent told me yesterday
*05:06.780- 05:13.160* :  he waited six and a half hours in a very long queue under the sun it's 32 degree and he has
*05:13.160- 05:19.200* :  waited six and a half hours to get five bread that isn't enough for one meal for his ten
*05:19.200- 05:24.300* :  members of his family and the water is a real real struggle we seem to be able to
*05:24.300- 05:31.380* :  or near be villages to find any shop that sell a little water the water and food a real issue here.
*05:31.480- 05:34.960* :  People are struggling to get a clean water and struggling to get food.
*05:35.640- 05:41.680* :  Rushdie Abelouf in Gaza it's become even more difficult in recent days to find out exactly what
*05:41.680- 05:47.280* :  is going on in the midst of war in Gaza. Much of what we do know comes from journalists living
*05:47.280- 05:52.240* :  there often with their families and continuing to work in the face of great personal danger.
*05:52.860- 05:57.300* :  At least 31 journalists have been killed in the conflict so far which according to the US
*05:57.300- 06:02.900* :  committee to protect journalists makes it the deadliest period for the profession in the past three
*06:02.900- 06:06.280* :  decades. Fugel Keen sent this report from Jerusalem.
*06:14.480- 06:21.260* :  All of this they record every day and night whether they've slept or not with no safe place to
*06:21.260- 06:27.540* :  go back to it. It is journalism in extremists and without them the world would be ignorant
*06:28.040- 06:30.060* :  of the true cast of war in Gaza.
*06:34.140- 06:40.160* :  Mahmoud Basam has been filming since the war broke out more than three weeks ago constantly
*06:40.160- 06:45.400* :  updating the BBC with images and information from refugee camps and hospitals.
*06:46.300- 06:51.840* :  From our base in Jerusalem I reached Mahmoud by telephone in the south of Gaza where hundreds
*06:51.840- 06:59.300* :  of thousands have sought refuge. I'm just wondering what it is like to witness this every day and to
*06:59.300- 07:05.500* :  live in the kind of danger that you're living in. I am a journalist and my mission is to deliver
*07:05.500- 07:11.080* :  what I am seeing but sometimes I have to stop and sit with these kids that I see and try to give
*07:11.080- 07:18.920* :  them water, try to provide them with what they need. Journalists go to work in Gaza knowing
*07:18.920- 07:26.100* :  their families are under threat from air attack. This is the funeral for the family of Wahel
*07:26.100- 07:35.540* :  Al-Dakhdua, the Al-Jazeera Bureau chief in Gaza. He lost his wife, son, daughter and infant
*07:35.540- 07:42.060* :  grandson. A day later he went back to work saying it was his duty. Sharif Mansour is the
*07:42.060- 07:47.680* :  Middle East expert of the committee to protect journalists. We have seen more journalists killed
*07:47.680- 07:55.220* :  in the last close to three weeks than have been killed over 21 years of covering this conflict.
*07:55.460- 08:02.240* :  A lot of journalists have lost colleagues, family, homes and they were forced to flee where there
*08:02.240- 08:09.320* :  is no safe haven or exit. My name is Yara Eid, I'm a Palestinian journalist. I live my whole life in
*08:09.320- 08:14.740* :  Gaza till I was 16 and I now have been living in the UK for the last seven years. I lost my best
*08:14.740- 08:21.000* :  friend, Rahim, who was a Palestinian journalist but he wasn't just a journalist. He was 21 years old,
*08:21.000- 08:26.480* :  he was a brother, he was a best friend, he was a dreamer, he was a photographer and he loved
*08:26.480- 08:32.340* :  life very much. He really had many dreams and he really wanted to be a photographer that chose
*08:32.340- 08:37.640* :  the whole world, the beauty of Gaza. But he was killed doing what he loved most, you know,
*08:37.880- 08:41.320* :  journalism and reporting and sharing our suffering with our truth.
*08:43.660- 08:49.340* :  This was Mahmoud Basan's recording of two little sisters being treated in Al Najar Hospital yesterday.
*08:52.020- 09:00.580* :  They survived but her six-month-old cousin was killed. Mahmoud has an 11-month-old child
*09:01.320- 09:05.500* :  himself. There are times he admits when he's overcome by the trauma he witnesses.
*09:09.240- 09:13.980* :  As hard as it is to see what I see and as much as I am trying to deliver this message,
*09:14.520- 09:20.660* :  sometimes from behind the camera I just stand and cry and the only thing I can do is be silent.
*09:22.820- 09:28.480* :  It's dusk and the evening call to prayer here in Jerusalem. We've been editing in the safety
*09:28.480- 09:36.860* :  security of a hotel room. My colleague is just 83 kilometers down the road. We'll be spending
*09:36.860- 09:41.420* :  this night as they've spent so many previous nights under bombardment.
*09:43.880- 09:51.480* :  Furgle Keen reporting. Two Bangladesh now where tens of thousands of clothing factory workers
*09:51.480- 09:55.880* :  are protesting, calling for higher wages. The authorities said huge crowds of
*09:55.880- 10:01.540* :  block roads and smashed up factories that produced clothes for major Western brands outside the
*10:01.540- 10:10.780* :  capital Dhaka. Police were out to confront them. As you can hear they fired tear gas and then
*10:10.780- 10:16.740* :  later water cannon to disperse the people on the streets. I also saw South Asia editor Ambrassan
*10:16.740- 10:22.380* :  Atarajan, what triggered these protests? It's a classic debate between cheap clothes and
*10:22.380- 10:26.600* :  what are the wages for the workers who are making these in countries like Bangladesh. As you know
*10:26.600- 10:33.160* :  Bangladesh is the second biggest exporter of ready-to-wear clothes to Western countries, especially if you
*10:33.160- 10:38.380* :  go down to Oxford, straight here in London, you walk into any shop like Zara, H&M. You'll find clothes
*10:38.380- 10:43.880* :  made in Bangladesh. But these cheap clothes also has become an issue because what kind of pay
*10:43.880- 10:48.480* :  they're getting. Now Bangladesh is among the countries where they pay is among the lowest in the
*10:48.480- 10:53.660* :  world according to the trade unions. Now tens of thousands of workers took to the streets outside
*10:53.660- 10:58.940* :  the capital Dhaka. I've been there several times and every five years they have this protest demanding
*10:58.940- 11:04.920* :  better wages because by the time they get these wages then they local inflation for example due to
*11:04.920- 11:09.300* :  reasons in war in Ukraine or in Israel Gaza then prices go up then they are getting affected.
*11:09.900- 11:14.380* :  So now they say they're getting only $75 a month that is a minimum wage of course they can get
*11:14.380- 11:20.060* :  more if they do over time. So they want more than $200. That has been that demand. So this is a
*11:20.320- 11:24.920* :  way to put pressure on the government and the factory owners to accept all the demands. Now
*11:25.300- 11:29.820* :  the government has to set up a panel to look into the demands but this has been going on for years
*11:29.820- 11:35.340* :  in Bangladesh where the factory workers are demanding better wages. It seems unlikely perhaps that
*11:35.340- 11:41.160* :  the factory owners will capitulate and give that big increase in wages but I suppose conditions
*11:42.380- 11:47.880* :  have improved to a certain extent haven't they over the years. After several accidents in which
*11:47.880- 11:53.040* :  hundreds of workers were killed in Bangladesh all the western brands and the authorities got
*11:53.040- 11:58.860* :  together to improve safety standards in Bangladesh as a result fire safety worker safety and also
*11:58.860- 12:03.940* :  working hours they have improved in many of the factories being inspected by the western
*12:03.940- 12:09.220* :  fashion brands but there are also there's you know behind the scenes factories where there's some
*12:09.220- 12:13.380* :  of them are subcontracted and that is where the issue is whether these factories are with the
*12:13.380- 12:18.200* :  following the rules and whether they are giving the minimum wage to the workers and that is why
*12:18.200- 12:22.940* :  activists are calling for in a better inspection and better monitoring from various agencies
*12:23.320- 12:24.140* :  as well as the government.
*12:24.700- 12:30.120* :  Amber Saneti Rajan. Next the United States has announced that it's going to bulk by Japanese
*12:30.120- 12:37.080* :  scallops to supply its military in Japan. This comes in response to China banning Japanese seafood
*12:37.080- 12:42.340* :  on food safety grounds. Our business correspondent Katie Silver told us about this geopolitical
*12:42.340- 12:48.480* :  seafood spat. Beijing first announced this measure earlier this year that came after Japan got the
*12:48.480- 12:53.500* :  all clear to start releasing waste water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific
*12:54.080- 12:59.420* :  and to give you an idea of course this power plant was damaged back in the 2011 tsunami and more
*12:59.420- 13:05.060* :  than a million tons of treated waste water had accumulated during that time. Now China which
*13:05.060- 13:10.040* :  previously was the biggest buyer of Japanese seafood said that it was going to ban any imports
*13:10.040- 13:15.000* :  due to safety fears in fact Russia followed suit. Now Japan at the time said that the water was
*13:15.000- 13:20.820* :  safe pointed to similar releases of treated nuclear waste water in China and France and many
*13:20.820- 13:25.560* :  scientists agreed including for example the United Nations nuclear watchdog who also approved
*13:25.560- 13:30.960* :  the plan but in order to counter this seafood ban we've heard from Washington's ambassador to
*13:30.960- 13:37.320* :  Tokyo Ram Emmanuel who says the UK will the US sorry will bulk by Japanese seafood in order to feed
*13:37.320- 13:42.680* :  the military there and to sell in shops on military bases and he says this is in response to China
*13:42.680- 13:47.420* :  waging what he called quote economic wars. Is this likely to make a difference though?
*13:48.380- 13:52.860* :  Well as I say China was the biggest buyer of seafood and it is being seen as some quite token
*13:52.860- 13:58.360* :  gesture at the moment to give you an idea Japan used to export about a hundred thousand tons of
*13:58.460- 14:03.100* :  scallops to China now it's only expected to be about one thousand tons only you know less than
*14:03.100- 14:08.340* :  one percent basically the first purchase under the scheme of fraction of that but speaking to
*14:08.340- 14:13.320* :  Reuters news agency we heard from Ram Emmanuel he said that it's going to be expanded it's likely
*14:13.320- 14:17.520* :  the start of a long term contract that's going to extend to all different types of seafood and
*14:17.540- 14:22.840* :  we said that this is the best way that they have proven in this instances where China wages what
*14:22.840- 14:27.380* :  they call this economic coercion to aid and comes to the assistance of these targeted countries. Now
*14:27.740- 14:32.300* :  China as you can imagine is not happy it's responded a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said
*14:32.300- 14:37.120* :  that the responsibility of diplomats is to promote friendship between countries rather than smearing
*14:37.120- 14:42.740* :  and stirring up travel and we also heard on this issue from the trade ministers from the group of
*14:42.840- 14:47.620* :  seven or the G7 nations which of course is an organization of the world's largest so-called
*14:47.620- 14:52.820* :  advanced economies and they called over the weekend for an immediate repeal of these bans on Japanese
*14:53.660- 14:58.860* :  Katie Silver police in Britain are investigating the death of an American ice hockey player who died
*14:58.860- 15:04.840* :  after his neck was cut by a skate blade during a game in the English city of Sheffield and I'm
*15:04.840- 15:09.880* :  Johnson was fatally injured in a collision while playing for the Nottingham Panthers on Saturday
*15:10.460- 15:15.480* :  as a result net guards are going to be made mandatory in ice hockey in England from next year
*15:16.060- 15:21.300* :  Shane Moore from rival club Oxford City Stars explained why the change was needed
*15:21.960- 15:26.420* :  we do have armor all over the front of the bodies for players and there's some armor in the back
*15:26.420- 15:31.380* :  of the bodies as well the skate's are sharp absolutely and I think this is why the net guard
*15:31.380- 15:36.880* :  piece is really important let's be really clear this was an absolute freak accident that happened
*15:36.920- 15:43.100* :  but if a net guard could prevent that happening again just once then it's absolutely worth
*15:43.100- 15:49.280* :  first mandating this to our players so how common are net guards in the sport in the UK and globally
*15:49.280- 15:54.960* :  a question for our sports reporter Isaac Flanning it is compulsory in Scotland and for those playing
*15:55.360- 16:00.620* :  for the Great Britain team internationally but it isn't compulsory elsewhere I mean if you're under
*16:00.620- 16:06.460* :  18 you do have to wear a net guarding you have to wear a full face visor if you look at the NHL
*16:06.460- 16:11.380* :  you see the players with the half face visors now the English ice hockey association which looks
*16:11.380- 16:17.060* :  after all levels of ice hockey in England below the top division which is where Adam Johnson played
*16:17.060- 16:22.600* :  for the Nottingham Panthers they say that they are going to mandate net guards after what
*16:22.600- 16:26.940* :  happened they say that supply issues as a reason why it won't happen immediately they don't think
*16:26.940- 16:32.380* :  they'll be able to get enough net guards around the league but the rules do differ depending on where
*16:32.380- 16:36.660* :  you're playing in the world so Finland and Sweden there compulsory you do have to wear it there
*16:37.040- 16:42.620* :  in the German top flight hockey league you have to wear a net guard now the NHL which is a national
*16:42.620- 16:48.300* :  hockey league in the United States and Canada that is the world's top hockey league and net guard
*16:48.300- 16:53.440* :  aren't mandatory there and they haven't shared yet whether they're going to change their stance
*16:53.480- 16:59.020* :  on it I think what we've seen with what's happened to Adam Johnson is a lot of soul searching and I
*16:59.020- 17:04.220* :  think it is a fluid situation and I wouldn't be surprised to hear something from the NHL over the
*17:04.220- 17:10.700* :  coming days you would have thought that people and players would have welcomed the use of a net guard
*17:10.700- 17:15.280* :  but not everybody wants to wear one well I think the reason why people don't want to wear one
*17:15.280- 17:21.200* :  is there's a stigma around the net guard as you become an adult you see most players ditching
*17:21.200- 17:26.920* :  the full face visor and the net guard and Abby Kohlshaw who plays for Great Britain
*17:26.940- 17:33.020* :  she's talked about the need to change the mentality around net guards sportsmen and women
*17:33.020- 17:37.940* :  the creatures of comfort and some players have complained that it's not comfortable wearing a net guard
*17:37.940- 17:42.680* :  but she says that I choose need to change she says that players tend to wind up other players if
*17:42.680- 17:48.340* :  you're wearing a net guard and full face masks I mean I watch the tribute being paid to Adam
*17:48.340- 17:53.660* :  Johnson by his former club the Pittsburgh penguins in the NHL and despite this horrific incident
*17:53.660- 17:58.500* :  I didn't see many of the players wearing a net guard I think the conversation will definitely
*17:58.500- 18:04.940* :  continue after what has happened I was like fanning still to come
*18:09.280- 18:14.020* :  it's time to vote for the BBC women's footballer of the year 2023 and the global
*18:14.020- 18:18.720* :  shortlist is out we'll hear about the five footballers on that shortlist
*18:25.560- 18:30.240* :  amazing sports stories how exactly do you survive a race that's deliberately designed
*18:30.400- 18:35.240* :  to break you physically mentally and emotionally it's about the risk takers
*18:35.240- 18:42.660* :  I decided to climb the Himalayas all 14 picks and the game changers I want to play like my brother
*18:42.660- 18:49.440* :  I want what he has amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service the rules were holding her back
*18:49.940- 18:54.740* :  so she would have to rewrite them search for amazing sports stories wherever you get your BBC
*18:54.740- 19:02.540* :  podcasts King Charles and Queen Camilla have begun a four day state visit to Kenya their first to
*19:02.540- 19:07.740* :  one of Britain's former colonies the visit coincides with celebrations of 60 years of independence
*19:07.740- 19:13.160* :  for the east african nation but the king is also facing growing calls to apologise for abuses
*19:13.160- 19:18.100* :  during Britain's colonial rule our senior africa correspondent and soy reports
*19:23.380- 19:30.080* :  a war song sung by Adnes Muthani it's still fresh in her mind dick is later the 90-year-old says
*19:30.080- 19:35.400* :  she was a major in the outlawed Maumau organization during Kenya's most brutal uprising against
*19:35.400- 19:41.740* :  the colonial government she fought alongside her husband General Bahati Adnes is he never
*19:41.740- 19:51.720* :  lived to realize the main goal of his role in Maumau land we were not compensated the land
*19:51.720- 20:00.560* :  we fought for was taken by others we became useless people she shows us the grave where he's buried
*20:00.560- 20:07.100* :  at their home in Shamata central Kenya across the valley are picturesque hills these are some of
*20:07.100- 20:14.440* :  Kenya's most fertile lands for half a century they belonged exclusively to colonial settlers and
*20:14.440- 20:20.060* :  were part of what were called the white islands locals like Adnes had been pushed to the fringes
*20:20.720- 20:28.380* :  and that brood the rebellion in Nairobi capital of Kenya Europeans and african still walk the streets
*20:28.380- 20:33.600* :  in fear of the dreaded Maumau the Maumau were brutal but the colonial government's response to
*20:33.600- 20:38.720* :  the insurrection made the conflict one of the bloodiest in the empire more than a thousand people
*20:38.720- 20:44.340* :  were executed by hanging thousands were killed and many more detained and tortured
*20:45.640- 20:50.340* :  i've come to downtown Nairobi it's very busy as usual there's a characteristic traffic
*20:50.820- 20:57.000* :  in front of me lots of buses and right in the middle of kimati street is the statue of field martial
*20:57.000- 21:03.740* :  dead and kimati he was the leader of Maumau but this statue was erected in 2007 and that's because
*21:03.740- 21:10.480* :  for decades after independence the Maumau remained an underground group it was prescribed by law
*21:11.000- 21:17.000* :  but that law changed in 2003 and that's when the Maumau members came out of the shadows
*21:17.720- 21:21.000* :  and they sued the British government and won an out of court settlement
*21:22.460- 21:28.440* :  Kenyan lawyer Paul Muite says the compensation which is paid to just over 5,200 victims
*21:29.220- 21:35.060* :  wasn't enough that case was hitched on narrow perspectives in law
*21:35.860- 21:41.340* :  namely people who were still alive and who could be examined by doctors and the doctors could
*21:41.340- 21:47.940* :  confirm that these people were tortured years ago it lives out many people who were in detention
*21:48.220- 21:56.140* :  many people who were killed women who were risking their lives cooking for the Maumau
*21:56.200- 22:02.780* :  the king will be acknowledging that painful past surely doesn't it cover what you're talking about
*22:02.780- 22:09.940* :  without a commission of inquiry without addressing the plight of those who have never been acknowledged
*22:09.940- 22:14.600* :  giving them a bit of compensation will never bring enclosure to this issue
*22:14.860- 22:19.580* :  historian Caroline Elkins says the acknowledgement would be an extraordinary step
*22:19.980- 22:24.740* :  it's extraordinary but the right thing to do is to change history books to change museums and
*22:24.740- 22:29.140* :  Britain to provide funding in Kenya for those who separate through these periods of time and also
*22:29.140- 22:33.900* :  help the Kenyan government in terms of even even establishing its own museums its own cultural
*22:33.900- 22:43.180* :  artifacts back in Shemata Agnes offers a prayer by her husband's gravesite many have not lived
*22:43.180- 22:48.820* :  to hear the acknowledgement from the monarchy of the pain they endured Agnes welcomes it
*22:49.120- 22:54.860* :  but also hopes she'll finally receive land she and many of her peers fought for
*22:55.560- 23:01.820* :  and saw on Monday the government of Haiti suspended all flights to Nicaragua
*23:02.360- 23:06.980* :  in an attempt to limit the number of migrants trying to reach the United States the decision
*23:06.980- 23:12.060* :  left hundreds of people stranded at the international airport in the capital Porto Prince
*23:12.620- 23:16.120* :  Robin Brent found out more from our America's editor Leonardo Russia
*23:16.840- 23:23.100* :  Nicaragua and the government of Daniel Othega has eased visa restrictions for many countries
*23:23.100- 23:29.900* :  including Haiti Cuba and some African countries so with that you have charter flights being booked
*23:30.400- 23:36.840* :  on Monday this decision was announced in Haiti there were six flights six charter flights
*23:36.840- 23:42.640* :  booked from Porto Prince to Managua and what's being said is that the Nicaraguan government
*23:42.640- 23:48.500* :  is doing that because of sanctions imposed by the United States for alleged human rights
*23:48.500- 23:53.980* :  violations there's been a surge in the number of people arriving from Haiti and Cuba mainly
*23:53.980- 23:59.480* :  to Nicaragua and they don't stay there Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in the region
*23:59.480- 24:05.200* :  what they do is they immediately go north towards the Mexico border with the United States
*24:05.540- 24:11.020* :  can you tell us a bit as well about the numbers of people in Haiti who are seeking to travel this
*24:11.020- 24:17.320* :  route what we have this year is a record number of migrants arriving on the US border with Mexico
*24:17.320- 24:22.680* :  and the US is trying to stop that one of the measures that the United States has done and that's
*24:22.680- 24:27.740* :  why I think it's has put pressure on Haiti we don't know for sure but I think they put pressure
*24:27.740- 24:34.540* :  on the Asian government is that they are giving 30,000 visas a month to people from those four
*24:34.540- 24:41.600* :  countries that are seen a particularly vulnerable Haiti Venezuela Cuba and Nicaragua so they say we're
*24:41.600- 24:46.660* :  giving those visas we want some action for you to stop or to try to stop illegal migration
*24:47.240- 24:52.780* :  and just finally in terms of the relationship between the US the Biden administration and Daniel
*24:52.780- 24:58.660* :  Ortega's government in Nicaragua what's the politics at play here I mean is there a view that
*24:58.740- 25:02.740* :  the Ortega government is trying to weaponize this is trying to seek further concessions from
*25:02.740- 25:08.680* :  Washington DC yes that's what people have been saying that he will use that as a bargaining chip
*25:08.680- 25:14.260* :  to tell him look if I can stop that I can control that if you ease some of the sanctions
*25:14.800- 25:20.900* :  because this situation has escalated in the past two or three years in the same way that the
*25:20.900- 25:27.060* :  repression in Nicaragua has gone up so the United States has put sanctions against individuals his
*25:27.060- 25:34.380* :  family his children his wife and so I think what people are saying is that he would be using that
*25:34.380- 25:41.320* :  to get the United States to negotiate easing those sanctions Leonardo Rosha now if you're a fan
*25:41.320- 25:47.080* :  of women's football you have another few days to vote for the 2023 BBC women's footballer of
*25:47.080- 25:53.600* :  the year previous winners have been England's Beth Meade and Lucy bronze the Netherlands the Viana
*25:53.600- 26:00.300* :  Medema and Nigeria's as he said Oshawala I've been speaking to BBC sports Maz Faruki who will be
*26:00.300- 26:04.880* :  presenting the award this year every year with this award it becomes harder and harder to
*26:04.880- 26:08.460* :  whittle the shortlist down to just five contenders for a panel I do not envy them they're
*26:08.460- 26:12.840* :  tasked particularly in a world cup year and when the sport seems to be growing and growing and
*26:12.840- 26:18.220* :  getting more competitive each year but our five nominees this year are Barcelona and Spain midfielder
*26:18.220- 26:25.400* :  at Hannibal Mati Manchester United and England's goalkeeper Mary Erbs Chelsea and Australia's Sam Kerr
*26:25.740- 26:31.080* :  Wolfsburg and Germany's Alexandra Pop and another Barcelona player and the Sweden defender
*26:31.080- 26:36.740* :  Fridelina Rolfa so we have players representing plenty of different positions on the pitch within our
*26:36.740- 26:41.580* :  shortlist of five but also I think as well truly five players who've been at the very top
*26:41.580- 26:45.800* :  and so consistent at the very highest level for both club and country of the last 12 months
*26:46.240- 26:50.900* :  and this year's award come in the same year that the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand
*26:50.900- 26:56.000* :  was the best attended to date what impact has it had on the sport you think it was a huge
*26:56.000- 26:59.860* :  success I think the World Cup the biggest women's World Cup I can remember in terms of all the
*26:59.860- 27:04.600* :  records broken as you mentioned and also the standard of the football we saw on the pitches as well
*27:04.600- 27:09.620* :  across both Australia and New Zealand and each of our five nominees shone in different ways
*27:09.620- 27:14.580* :  at the tournament as well think of arguably for the co-host their biggest moment of the tournament
*27:14.580- 27:19.640* :  when the Matilda's captain Sam Kerr scored that memorable goal against England in the semi-finals
*27:20.080- 27:24.500* :  the goals Alexandra Pop score for Germany who even though they had a disappointing tournament
*27:24.500- 27:29.800* :  by their high standards she still finished as the joint second highest goal scorer at the World Cup
*27:30.340- 27:35.260* :  Mary Eurbs pulling off that penalty save in the final that kept England in that game in the
*27:35.260- 27:39.480* :  second half Attana Bon Mati of course went all the way to lift the trophy with Spain and
*27:39.480- 27:44.480* :  was awarded player of the tournament as well and Fridelina Rolfa making the last four was
*27:44.480- 27:50.040* :  Sweden scoring to help them secure the bronze medal as well and also scoring a vital penalty in
*27:50.040- 27:55.120* :  that shootout against the USA which early on in the tournament not the holders out in the last 16
*27:55.120- 27:59.980* :  again one of the huge huge moments of that World Cup. Mass before you go remind us how
*27:59.980- 28:04.860* :  people can vote for the BBC women's footballer of the year. Well remember what makes this
*28:04.860- 28:10.680* :  all different from others in the game is that it's decided by you are listeners you get to vote for
*28:10.680- 28:16.060* :  who you believe should be the BBC women's football of the year 2023 so please please make sure to
*28:16.060- 28:22.280* :  have your say you can head to bbc.com slash women's football to vote and you've got until 9 GMT
*28:22.280- 28:27.760* :  on Friday the 3rd of November to have your say. That was Mass Farouki and the winner will be announced
*28:27.820- 28:34.980* :  on Tuesday the 28th of November. Now if you end up getting more tricks than treats this Halloween
*28:34.980- 28:40.480* :  don't worry new research suggests that getting wound up or angry could actually have its benefits
*28:41.140- 28:46.020* :  making you more productive and even help with achieving goals it goes against the common idea
*28:46.020- 28:51.820* :  that anger clouds thinking and that being happy or level headed is a more useful state for getting
*28:51.820- 28:56.600* :  things done. The not very angry but very productive Stephanie Prentice tell me more.
*28:57.200- 29:01.740* :  As you sort of alluded to there these findings have surprised people they found that anger can
*29:01.740- 29:08.520* :  help people overcome challenges or obstacles in quite a wide variety of situations so it was a
*29:08.520- 29:13.060* :  sample size of a thousand people and they were triggered into experiencing different emotions
*29:13.060- 29:19.160* :  like joy anger sadness and then given a series of tests like a word puzzle or a video game
*29:19.500- 29:24.740* :  so the angry people they were more likely to persevere they showed a greater sense of determination
*29:24.860- 29:30.020* :  there were also more likely to cheat to get prizes that was one of the drivers in the study
*29:30.020- 29:35.640* :  basically achieving their goals no matter what it took. In one anagram test actually the angry
*29:35.640- 29:43.440* :  people scored 39% higher and generally researchers saw shorter response times and higher scores from
*29:43.440- 29:49.500* :  them. Now other emotions did help with performance including desire not show how they triggered that
*29:49.860- 29:55.160* :  and amusement but anger came out top every time. It's very interesting is it because
*29:55.460- 30:00.100* :  anger has a very bad reputation think of all the phrases like seeing red your blood is boiling
*30:00.100- 30:04.000* :  you're losing your rag all these kind of things suggest somebody who's a bit of a headless
*30:04.000- 30:08.400* :  chicken when they're angry but not the case. You're absolutely right it has a bad reputation
*30:08.400- 30:13.000* :  generally that sense it will cloud your judgment and socially we're kind of conditioned
*30:13.000- 30:18.460* :  over to pursue happiness as a life goal but conversely this study suggests anger could help us
*30:18.460- 30:24.240* :  get to some of our life goals. So Professor Heather Lent she's the lead author of this study
*30:24.240- 30:30.000* :  she spoke to us earlier and said work is one area where anger can be useful. I think it depends
*30:30.000- 30:35.700* :  on what your goal is and the obstacle that you're trying to overcome so if your goal is to
*30:35.700- 30:41.540* :  perform well at work and you become angry at obstacles to that performance it can actually motivate
*30:41.540- 30:47.200* :  you to help overcome whatever those obstacles are and do better. So Heather Lent said concluded
*30:47.200- 30:52.440* :  going through life experiencing an array of emotions including anger will get the best overall
*30:52.440- 30:57.460* :  outcomes. But surely anger will be more useful or appropriate in some circumstances.
*30:58.340- 31:02.960* :  Absolutely so Heather we just heard she calls that the functionalist theory of emotion meaning
*31:02.960- 31:07.940* :  quite simply all emotions are useful but it's crucial to tap into the correct one at the correct
*31:08.480- 31:12.700* :  times. She actually calls that the Swiss Army and I theory with all its different tools.
*31:12.700- 31:17.500* :  Basically the advice is try to choose the best one for the job at HALT.
*31:20.920- 31:24.980* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later on
*31:25.200- 31:30.500* :  but before we go he's a message from Jackie Leonard. Hello this is a request for your questions
