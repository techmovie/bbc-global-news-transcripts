*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.540* :  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.860- 00:23.660* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Friday the 27th of October.
*00:24.320- 00:29.520* :  At a heated United Nations debate, Israel's ambassador says the world must not ignore the atrocities
*00:29.520- 00:35.720* :  carried out by Hamas. Any call for a ceasefire is not an attempt at peace. It is an attempt
*00:35.720- 00:42.120* :  to tie Israel's hands, preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens.
*00:42.720- 00:48.380* :  The Palestinian ambassador calls for justice, not vengeance. Nothing can justify war crimes,
*00:49.040- 00:56.480* :  crime against humanity and genocide. Nothing can justify the killing of a single Palestinian child.
*00:57.220- 01:00.120* :  We'll hear from the UN and get the latest on the conflict.
*01:02.700- 01:07.960* :  Also in the podcast, a gunman who killed 18 people in the US state of Maine is still on the run,
*01:07.960- 01:13.940* :  and the Taliban in Afghanistan release a prominent advocate of girls education after months in jail.
*01:18.160- 01:23.200* :  For more than 75 years, disputes between Israelis and Palestinians have proved impossible
*01:23.200- 01:29.280* :  to reconcile, with rival world powers taking opposing sides. Global divisions have only
*01:29.280- 01:34.940* :  intensified following the Hamas atrocity of the 7th of October, and the devastating Israeli response.
*01:35.020- 01:40.640* :  And those disagreements have been on display at an emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly
*01:40.640- 01:45.740* :  in New York, which was debating whether to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*01:46.400- 01:49.200* :  Our correspondent at the UN Nettafik has this report.
*01:49.980- 01:54.580* :  As the session began, the president of the General Assembly urged members not to use it to
*01:54.580- 01:59.580* :  fan the flames of division and revenge, but to unify to save lives and end the violence.
*01:59.580- 02:05.540* :  The first to speak was the Palestinian ambassador, Riyadh Mansour, who spoke emotionally about
*02:05.540- 02:10.400* :  the death, trauma, and devastation civilians in Gaza were living with every day.
*02:11.040- 02:15.700* :  Israel's relentless bombardment, he said, had killed 7,000 Palestinians,
*02:15.700- 02:20.580* :  mainly children and women, and he asked the assembly how that could be defended.
*02:20.580- 02:26.420* :  He urged members to vote to save lives, to uphold international law, and to put an end to what
*02:26.420- 02:30.000* :  he called three weeks of the worst double standards seen in decades.
*02:45.820- 02:51.900* :  The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, was next and spoke about the lasting pain of the
*02:51.900- 02:58.420* :  October 7th attacks by Hamas. He said had killed more than 1,400 Israelis. He urged members not
*02:58.420- 03:01.320* :  to vote for the resolution, which he said was biased.
*03:01.940- 03:08.160* :  Any call for a ceasefire is not an attempt at peace. It is an attempt to tie Israel's hands,
*03:08.160- 03:14.560* :  preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens. Hamas, the terror group that
*03:14.560- 03:21.940* :  started this war, is not even mentioned. The United States Israel's staunchest ally also claims
*03:21.940- 03:28.860* :  a ceasefire will only help Hamas. Nidat Talfik in New York. The death toll given by the Hamas
*03:28.860- 03:33.820* :  Ron Health Ministry in Gaza has been publicly questioned by the U.S. President Joe Biden.
*03:33.820- 03:41.820* :  Palestinian officials have now responded by releasing 6,747 names of those they say were killed,
*03:42.280- 03:49.360* :  including the six age and ID number of each. A further 281 bodies have not yet been identified,
*03:49.360- 03:54.980* :  they said. Israel's airstrikes have intensified over the past few days, and on Thursday,
*03:54.980- 04:01.440* :  the European Union joined calls for a humanitarian pause in the fighting to allow aid into Gaza.
*04:01.440- 04:06.220* :  In a statement issued after a European Council meeting, the leaders expressed their quote,
*04:06.220- 04:10.560* :  gravest concern for the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory.
*04:10.620- 04:14.980* :  The BBC's Paul Adams and Lee's do set who are both in Jerusalem,
*04:15.760- 04:20.340* :  discussed Israel's current military plans and whether there were any prospects for a ceasefire.
*04:21.080- 04:26.300* :  Israel's ambition is unlike anything we've ever seen before. Before it was all about
*04:26.800- 04:31.260* :  going and dealing with some tunnels, making sure that Hamas wouldn't pose a threat in the foreseeable
*04:31.340- 04:36.560* :  future. This is so completely different. The decision that has been taken to uproot Hamas
*04:36.560- 04:43.220* :  politically and militarily from the entire Gaza Strip, and we see no indication from Israel
*04:43.220- 04:49.420* :  that it is ready to back away from that grand ambition. So they're not going to be swayed by calls
*04:49.420- 04:54.800* :  for a ceasefire from the UN. When the Americans talk about humanitarian pauses,
*04:54.800- 04:59.320* :  maybe there's room for maneuver there. But ceasefires, not for a long while yet, I would say.
*04:59.560- 05:03.000* :  Yes, it does seem the President Joe Biden is being said here in Israeli media. He's given
*05:03.000- 05:09.300* :  space to Israel and not to space. We understand that very senior military officers are sitting down
*05:09.340- 05:15.580* :  with Israeli commanders and looking exactly at what would be involved in that ground attack
*05:15.580- 05:20.360* :  when it happened. Because the Americans, of course, have experience. In Iraq, they know what it's
*05:20.360- 05:24.160* :  like to go in on the ground. And some of those very commanders are indeed here. Now, there are
*05:24.160- 05:29.040* :  constraints coming from Washington that every effort should be made to release hostages before
*05:29.040- 05:34.800* :  a ground invasion. Right now, in Tel Aviv, there is a protest by relatives and family members of
*05:34.800- 05:38.960* :  people who are missing saying their patients is running out. They want Israel to do everything
*05:38.960- 05:43.740* :  it can to get the hostages out. So those pressures are enormous. Joe Biden talked about this the other
*05:43.740- 05:48.660* :  day when he was here, didn't he? Don't repeat the mistakes of 9-11. Don't act out of blind rage.
*05:48.660- 05:53.500* :  And so there are those American commanders here talking about how to avoid certain mistakes.
*05:53.980- 05:58.360* :  Maybe even talking about things like don't go in for a kind of debatification. In other words,
*05:58.360- 06:03.420* :  don't think that you can go into Gaza and remove Hamas as an idea by all means going to achieve certain
*06:03.420- 06:08.660* :  clearly defined objectives. But the idea that you can just remove the whole notion of Hamas
*06:09.040- 06:13.900* :  is for the bird. So perhaps that begins to explain why we're still waiting for
*06:14.420- 06:18.840* :  something more than just these occasional nighttime raids that the Israelis are doing at the moment.
*06:19.260- 06:25.100* :  Paul Adams and Lees du Sett in Jerusalem. As Paul mentioned, plans for an Israeli invasion of
*06:25.100- 06:31.360* :  Gaza are complicated by the 224 hostages that Israel says are currently being held by Hamas.
*06:31.920- 06:36.920* :  That rally by families in Tel Aviv was disrupted by air raid sirens.
*06:45.100- 06:50.000* :  And adding to the concerns of the families in a statement on Thursday, Hamas said that nearly
*06:50.000- 06:56.840* :  50 hostages it was holding in Gaza have been killed in Israeli air strikes. That figure is
*06:56.840- 07:02.040* :  impossible to verify. But the BBC did have a chance to question Hamas over its murderous
*07:02.040- 07:07.260* :  rampage of the 7th of October when our correspondent Yuga Bachega interviewed Hamas spokesman
*07:07.260- 07:08.760* :  Ghazi Hamad in Lebanon.
*07:19.860- 07:25.820* :  Confirmed and assured again and again that there was no command to kill any civilians.
*07:26.080- 07:30.880* :  You say this was a military operation but the result of it was that hundreds of civilians were killed.
*07:30.880- 07:36.060* :  Because the area is very wide and there are many people there and there was clashes and
*07:36.060- 07:42.960* :  confrontation. It's not confrontation. You invaded houses. We didn't have any intention
*07:42.960- 07:46.760* :  to call the civilians. You say you were not targeting civilians. Yes.
*07:47.020- 07:51.060* :  And you now have more than 200 hostages, many of them civilians.
*07:51.060- 07:53.640* :  Why don't you then just release those civilians?
*07:54.040- 07:57.980* :  We are ready to deal positively with the point of these hostages.
*07:58.300- 08:02.860* :  And I will declare this. I think we have to find suitable circumstances for this.
*08:03.120- 08:07.940* :  We are not planning from the first moment to have the hostages, as you said, the civilians.
*08:08.120- 08:09.060* :  It's a military operation.
*08:09.060- 08:11.740* :  But how does it advance the Palestinian cause?
*08:12.060- 08:16.160* :  I don't accept it from you that we are just killed the civilians in order to
*08:16.400- 08:19.820* :  We've seen the evidence. We've seen the pictures. We've seen it for you to do that.
*08:19.820- 08:22.320* :  It is not a question. It is a shame for you to do that.
*08:22.740- 08:25.600* :  We are fighting for dignity and for freedom.
*08:26.120- 08:31.680* :  By killing people in their homes, by invading a music festival and killing hundreds of people.
*08:31.680- 08:37.480* :  Israel's country, they provide and supply the occupation with money, with weapons.
*08:37.560- 08:39.080* :  Israel is state of occupation.
*08:39.080- 08:42.520* :  Israel is state of brutality of massacres.
*08:42.640- 08:46.260* :  How do you justify killing people as they sleep?
*08:46.640- 08:49.280* :  You know, families. How do you justify killing people?
*08:49.280- 08:50.680* :  I want to push up this system.
*08:51.540- 08:52.580* :  I want to stop this system.
*08:54.240- 08:55.480* :  Hamar, spokesman, Khazi.
*08:55.480- 08:58.780* :  Hamar, walking out of an interview with the BBC's Hugo Bachega.
*08:59.440- 09:03.140* :  Since the start of the conflict, the BBC has been hearing from people across the
*09:03.140- 09:04.860* :  region affected in different ways.
*09:05.660- 09:10.520* :  Maya and Becca are two Jewish women, both married to Palestinian men,
*09:10.540- 09:15.780* :  one resident of the Palestinian West Bank, the other Palestinian citizen of Israel.
*09:16.240- 09:21.040* :  Maya began by sharing her first reaction to the news of the terrible attack by Hamas
*09:21.360- 09:23.280* :  in southern Israel on the 7th of October.
*09:23.640- 09:28.160* :  It's almost hard to remember through the fog of everything that's happened in the past few weeks.
*09:28.340- 09:31.100* :  The conversations have been at times tense,
*09:31.780- 09:38.140* :  but Muhammad has been super supportive of me and the kind of huge range of feelings I've had
*09:38.560- 09:40.840* :  on October 7th when I woke up to the news.
*09:41.180- 09:45.120* :  I was shocked by what was happening and I think I wasn't able to fully process.
*09:45.800- 09:50.100* :  And I said, oh my god, we're headed towards some sort of horrible disaster for everyone.
*09:50.140- 09:53.740* :  In that moment, my first impulse was to reach out to him.
*09:54.200- 10:01.280* :  No one else because no one understands my love of the land and the place and its people
*10:01.280- 10:04.620* :  and my discomfort with the politics better than Muhammad.
*10:05.140- 10:09.480* :  The second kind of thing that I'm ashamed to admit this was from my side,
*10:09.480- 10:12.120* :  some questions to him that maybe we're not appropriate.
*10:12.120- 10:13.420* :  I mean, he's an individual.
*10:13.420- 10:18.460* :  He doesn't represent the Palestinian people and he definitely doesn't represent Hamas,
*10:18.460- 10:20.600* :  but I asked him to support this.
*10:20.780- 10:23.380* :  And I probably said it in a very rude, sarcastic tone.
*10:23.380- 10:26.700* :  Is this the sort of operation that you support?
*10:27.200- 10:28.740* :  And he was like, of course not.
*10:29.120- 10:32.240* :  But I had to ask him that question and I regret it.
*10:32.300- 10:35.000* :  And I think it was unfair and I think later I apologize.
*10:35.740- 10:38.840* :  I do think my first reaction was kind of similar to Maya's.
*10:38.840- 10:44.020* :  Like, I was like, nothing like this big from the Palestinian side has ever happened.
*10:44.020- 10:49.980* :  In my time, I immediately was like, they are going to punish Gaza so hard.
*10:50.100- 10:53.280* :  Like, I was like, this is going to be so, so bad.
*10:53.440- 10:56.520* :  And my brain immediately went to regional war.
*10:56.520- 11:00.940* :  And of course, I saw it about my family, my husband's family.
*11:01.080- 11:02.140* :  You know, they're my family.
*11:02.140- 11:04.060* :  I've been in this family for 13 years.
*11:04.760- 11:09.360* :  And I have watched videos or like testimonies of the Israeli Jews.
*11:09.640- 11:16.740* :  And I feel like I didn't even have time to grieve it because I was so panicked about the next step.
*11:17.000- 11:20.560* :  And it was like almost like on October 7th and even through the end of that first week,
*11:20.560- 11:23.560* :  like I was seeing all the solidarity with Israel.
*11:23.560- 11:26.260* :  And I was like, this is going to turn so quickly.
*11:26.740- 11:30.680* :  You're either going to say something about the disproportionate response,
*11:30.680- 11:33.260* :  which is definitely coming, or you're not.
*11:33.260- 11:34.960* :  And you're going to be a hypocrite.
*11:35.260- 11:37.100* :  In slow time, I was like, this is happening.
*11:37.260- 11:38.100* :  This is about to happen.
*11:38.520- 11:40.820* :  I sort of said this to some people in week one.
*11:40.940- 11:44.800* :  And I think I did get some backlash where people were like too soon.
*11:45.140- 11:48.360* :  And it's just been very interesting to watch the tides turn.
*11:48.860- 11:52.700* :  Becca and Maya, two Jewish women married to Palestinian men.
*11:54.100- 11:58.140* :  Returning now to a story you may have heard in our earlier global news podcast,
*11:58.140- 12:04.240* :  America's deadliest mass shooting this year, police in the Northeastern state of Maine are still
*12:04.240- 12:09.300* :  searching for the gunman who killed 18 people in the small city of Lewiston on Wednesday evening.
*12:09.300- 12:13.660* :  More than 60,000 people have been told to stay indoors as the manhunt continues.
*12:14.260- 12:19.220* :  The suspect has been identified as a 40-year-old US Army reservist called Robert Card.
*12:20.000- 12:23.060* :  William Ross of the Maine State Police warned people to be careful.
*12:23.780- 12:26.380* :  There is an arrest warrant for eight counts of murder,
*12:27.000- 12:31.820* :  Mr. Card. And the reason it's eight counts because 10 people have not yet been identified.
*12:31.820- 12:36.340* :  As those people are identified, accounts will probably go to the total of 18.
*12:36.840- 12:38.560* :  He should be considered armed and dangerous.
*12:39.320- 12:43.380* :  Based on our investigation, we believe this is someone that should not be approached.
*12:43.960- 12:47.060* :  Well, we got more of my Coruscondent in Lewiston, Nomiya Igbar.
*12:48.040- 12:51.920* :  The latest is that police just don't know where this suspect is.
*12:52.220- 12:54.840* :  Police say the 40-year-old had mental health issues.
*12:55.460- 12:58.440* :  And at one point, he's alleged to have threatened to shoot up a base
*12:59.160- 13:01.480* :  where he was stationed as an Army reservist.
*13:01.820- 13:04.340* :  So there's hundreds of officers looking for him.
*13:04.780- 13:08.460* :  We drove through Lewiston. This city is in lockdown.
*13:08.460- 13:09.580* :  Businesses are closed.
*13:09.820- 13:14.840* :  It feels a bit like COVID times when everything was so quiet.
*13:15.420- 13:18.480* :  But of course, it's an entirely different reason here.
*13:18.840- 13:21.140* :  The police are hoping that people will stay in,
*13:21.140- 13:26.020* :  stay safe so that they can try and find this man who is a fugitive.
*13:26.220- 13:30.800* :  Yeah, and take us through the attack on a bowling alley and a restaurant on Wednesday night.
*13:31.100- 13:33.680* :  It was just before 7 p.m. Eastern time.
*13:34.120- 13:36.700* :  And it happened at this bowling alley full of families,
*13:36.700- 13:40.120* :  you know, very normal, traditional pastime.
*13:40.520- 13:43.460* :  And then the shooting also happened at a local bar and grill.
*13:43.460- 13:45.800* :  So these two locations, we visited them earlier.
*13:45.800- 13:47.100* :  Obviously, they're all cordoned off.
*13:47.100- 13:49.840* :  You can't get anywhere near, but they're about four miles apart.
*13:49.980- 13:53.900* :  And you know, some of the stories we've been hearing are just awful.
*13:53.900- 13:58.620* :  One mother said she lay on top of her 11-year-old daughter at the bowling alley to protect her.
*13:58.920- 14:03.680* :  One man said that he thought at first the gunfire was a popping balloon.
*14:04.460- 14:08.020* :  I've reported on quite a few math shootings in America.
*14:08.660- 14:13.240* :  And what you tend to hear from people is that you never think that this sort of thing
*14:13.240- 14:14.080* :  will happen here.
*14:14.960- 14:19.200* :  Main is an incredibly quiet state, generally certainly,
*14:19.200- 14:22.260* :  Lewiston in terms of gun-related murders.
*14:22.260- 14:23.460* :  It's pretty low.
*14:23.780- 14:27.300* :  What I also find is when there are math shootings, of course,
*14:27.300- 14:29.660* :  there's that immediate grief anger.
*14:30.300- 14:32.080* :  And then it does turn into the politics.
*14:32.080- 14:34.860* :  People say to me, as I've experienced in the past,
*14:35.300- 14:38.060* :  this isn't political, but guns do end up becoming political.
*14:38.060- 14:42.080* :  I think there will be questions asked about gun laws in Maine.
*14:42.440- 14:45.960* :  Maine, of course, borders, Canada, as well as New Hampshire.
*14:46.720- 14:48.240* :  I guess they are also unalert.
*14:48.500- 14:52.860* :  They are. There's lots of authorities working together to try and catch this man.
*14:53.340- 14:55.580* :  Namia Ikbal in Lewiston in Maine.
*14:56.700- 15:01.720* :  Police in the Chinese city of Jiangja Gang have rescued more than a thousand cats
*15:01.720- 15:05.320* :  who could have been slaughtered and sold as poor call mutton.
*15:05.740- 15:10.000* :  The case has led to public outcry on Chinese social media and calls for the authorities
*15:10.000- 15:12.820* :  to clamp down on the trade in illicit cat meat.
*15:13.420- 15:16.040* :  James Reynolds spoke to BBC Monitoring's Carrie Allen.
*15:16.660- 15:21.360* :  Activists have noticed a large number of cats being held in these nailed wooden boxes,
*15:21.900- 15:25.380* :  and they've been monitoring it for days, and then they told the police when they were loaded
*15:25.380- 15:29.180* :  onto a truck. I mean, these could be people's pets that have been stolen.
*15:29.180- 15:33.600* :  Also, as well, if they're being used for consumption, there are health concerns.
*15:33.800- 15:37.800* :  You know, if they are strays, there is the potential that there could be disease as well
*15:37.800- 15:38.780* :  that people are consuming.
*15:39.660- 15:43.820* :  There have been stories like this before, as people have been discussing on Weibo,
*15:43.820- 15:46.260* :  which is China's equivalent of a platform like Facebook.
*15:47.020- 15:49.780* :  If there's profit to be made, people will do whatever it takes.
*15:49.780- 15:56.420* :  And these cats can be sold a considerable amount of money to restaurants that simply don't know
*15:56.800- 16:00.520* :  what the meat is, or maybe they do know, and they just want to turn a blind eye.
*16:01.160- 16:06.160* :  But can't me, and also dog meat as well, a consumption used to be very common in China.
*16:06.160- 16:12.220* :  When I was living in the country 10, 15 years ago, it used to be quite common that you would see,
*16:12.220- 16:17.620* :  even in urban cities, sometimes dog listed on the menu, but very much in the last decade,
*16:17.840- 16:22.160* :  there has been a shift in attitude with people feeling we shouldn't be eating dogs or cats,
*16:22.160- 16:26.700* :  and that's very much reflective in what I'm seeing in social media, people saying that
*16:27.240- 16:29.660* :  that they think this is horrific and that laws need to be changed.
*16:30.240- 16:32.140* :  Are the authorities taking it seriously?
*16:32.680- 16:34.380* :  They are definitely taking it seriously, yeah.
*16:34.740- 16:36.840* :  The people involved in this are being punished.
*16:36.840- 16:39.720* :  The cats, which were alive, have been moved to a shelter,
*16:40.380- 16:45.140* :  and there are attempts to try and reunite them with their owners if they indeed were pets.
*16:45.140- 16:49.460* :  One of the big concerns in China, or the back of this story, is whether laws will change.
*16:49.500- 16:54.720* :  There's a question of trying to hold accountability to people who steal cats if that's the case.
*16:55.100- 16:59.620* :  Are having pets increasingly become a thing as the middle class in China has expanded?
*17:00.120- 17:01.640* :  Oh, absolutely, it's so common.
*17:01.700- 17:05.760* :  You know, everybody wants to have a dog or a cat, and particularly in recent years,
*17:05.760- 17:10.040* :  before the one child policy was abolished, it was very common for families to have pets,
*17:10.040- 17:13.400* :  because it was almost a substitute for having another child.
*17:13.400- 17:17.940* :  But it is the case that in some urban cities where certain dog breeds, for example,
*17:18.680- 17:22.740* :  rockwilers are not allowed, so there are different laws in different places,
*17:22.740- 17:26.960* :  but dogs and cats, very, very common and well-loved pets.
*17:27.740- 17:29.940* :  Oh, China Media Analyst Kery Allen.
*17:32.440- 17:34.520* :  Still to come on the global news podcast?
*17:36.500- 17:41.440* :  On the stage in theong, Tatiana tries to talk through a glass wall to her grandmother,
*17:41.440- 17:46.940* :  she, and five of her 11 children died in the famine of the 1930s.
*17:47.360- 17:51.340* :  The entire Russian theatre company that's gone into exile in France.
*17:59.560- 18:05.640* :  India has expressed deep shock after the Gulf state of Qatar sentenced eight Indian citizens to death.
*18:06.280- 18:10.300* :  The former naval officers were detained last year accused of spying for Israel.
*18:10.840- 18:14.360* :  I heard more about this rather murky story from our South Asia regional editor,
*18:14.360- 18:15.680* :  Ann Barassan Etirajan.
*18:16.420- 18:21.080* :  Neither the Indian government nor the Katari authorities have given details about this case,
*18:21.140- 18:23.620* :  or even what are the actual charges.
*18:24.260- 18:29.280* :  Now, according to the Indian media, these eight former Indian Navy personnel, some of the
*18:29.280- 18:34.280* :  mercenia officers, they were working for a Gulf-based private company, working with the Katari
*18:34.280- 18:39.400* :  defense forces, providing services in terms of training, and according to one expert,
*18:40.060- 18:45.820* :  Katar was working closely with Italy to build a new type of submarine, and the accusation
*18:45.820- 18:51.500* :  was that some of these details of the submarine were given to Israel through these Indian
*18:51.500- 18:56.620* :  employees of this company. And based on that, this trial was conducted.
*18:56.660- 18:58.840* :  This has been going on for nearly a year.
*18:58.900- 19:03.820* :  This has triggered a huge concern, a lot of social media activity on this.
*19:03.820- 19:07.880* :  It has been trending, and the Indian government is now saying that we're exploring
*19:07.880- 19:13.680* :  all legal options to find out how they can help with these men, but it is a very strange case
*19:13.680- 19:17.800* :  when everyone was taken by surprise when the death penalty news came out.
*19:17.920- 19:24.460* :  Incredibly serious. What are diplomatic relations like between India and Katar?
*19:24.660- 19:28.700* :  Like many of the Gulf countries, Katar and India, they share a close relationship.
*19:28.700- 19:34.820* :  There are about 800,000 Indians working in Katar, and they're sending more than four billion
*19:34.820- 19:39.380* :  dollars every year as limitances. And if you look at the Katari population, they're not more than
*19:39.380- 19:45.140* :  350,000, so you can as well imagine Indians are one of the biggest expatriate groups in Katar.
*19:45.480- 19:51.220* :  What it shows clearly that whatever they were doing, the Indian foreign ministry was not really
*19:51.220- 19:55.380* :  having any effect because this could have been done behind the scenes, they could have been
*19:55.380- 20:01.120* :  deported. But now the only option seems to be go for an appeal or the emir of Katar giving
*20:01.120- 20:05.720* :  a pardon and then deport them, but this will be a huge embarrassment for the Indian government.
*20:05.720- 20:10.080* :  If something goes wrong in the appeal score, then it becomes a diplomatic issue and Indian
*20:10.080- 20:14.520* :  government, Indian foreign ministry saying we are now exploring other options and behind the
*20:14.520- 20:19.360* :  scenes, stocks are expected. South Asia, regional editor Anne Brassan, editor Rajan.
*20:19.580- 20:24.320* :  The authorities in Afghanistan have freed an activist who campaigned for girls' education,
*20:24.380- 20:27.660* :  which has been severely restricted since the Taliban retook power.
*20:28.580- 20:33.400* :  Matheula, Wisa has been detained for more than seven months. I found out more from
*20:33.400- 20:39.600* :  Afizullah Marouf of the BBC Afghan service. I know him since 10 years when I was in Kabul,
*20:39.600- 20:45.140* :  we deported his activity. He is considered like a champion of girls' education and Afghanistan,
*20:45.140- 20:51.560* :  traveling from province to province, from village to village. He is considered as a hero for most
*20:51.560- 20:58.000* :  of the activists and for girl education. Actually, there is no clear evidence why he was arrested,
*20:58.000- 21:03.520* :  but he was campaigning and asking a family to send their children, particularly daughters to school
*21:03.980- 21:11.460* :  education. Why has he been released now? I mean, one of a series of detainees to be freed by
*21:11.460- 21:16.500* :  the Taliban recently? I was speaking to his brother this morning and he was telling me that
*21:16.640- 21:22.120* :  the court of the Taliban has decided that seven months prison is enough for him and he should
*21:22.120- 21:28.320* :  be released. In Vino, the case was referred to a court almost two months before and there was
*21:28.360- 21:33.700* :  a lot of complaint outcry by the international community. So the court decided that okay,
*21:33.700- 21:36.900* :  the seven month imprisonment is enough for him and he should be released.
*21:37.060- 21:43.180* :  Other women's activists are still being held by the authorities there. Could this be a
*21:43.440- 21:49.620* :  change in their attitude following international pressure? It's really hard to estimate now whether
*21:49.620- 21:54.100* :  the international pressure do something the Taliban released the activists. In last week,
*21:54.100- 21:58.160* :  there was an Afghan French journalist who released by the Taliban as well after 10 months in
*21:58.160- 22:04.520* :  prison and we don't know whether this would be the beginning or there might be many more
*22:04.520- 22:07.020* :  months for the activists who are still in their prison.
*22:07.420- 22:13.800* :  Afezola Marouf of the BBC Afghan Service. Millions of Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia
*22:13.800- 22:19.620* :  launched its full-scale invasion of their country last year. Hundreds of thousands of Russians
*22:19.620- 22:25.480* :  have also moved abroad, particularly those who oppose the war. Among them is a whole theatre
*22:25.480- 22:30.600* :  company from a remote town in the Russian Far East which dared to challenge the state.
*22:31.320- 22:34.660* :  Now the company is performing in France from where Tim Hule reports.
*22:38.740- 22:42.640* :  The house lights go down. The black stage in front of us is bare,
*22:43.320- 22:49.260* :  save for a row of seven neat bundles of clothes. Then the actors appear in ghostly white
*22:49.260- 22:52.780* :  costumes piercing the swirling mist with torches.
*22:59.600- 23:04.540* :  They're from Kamsamausk on Amour, a city in the Far East of Russia and the bundles
*23:04.540- 23:09.180* :  are all that they were allowed to bring in their baggage allowance when they went into exile
*23:09.520- 23:10.680* :  here in Vion, France.
*23:17.880- 23:21.740* :  The story they tell on stage is of their own lives, their families,
*23:22.360- 23:26.540* :  and Russia in the 20th century. It's an attempt to understand themselves,
*23:27.480- 23:31.420* :  to answer the question, why did they all grow up so scared?
*23:32.100- 23:38.520* :  All my kids' photographs are just photos show a frightened little girl.
*23:38.820- 23:43.880* :  Tatiana Froova is director of the play. She founded the theatre company that's performing it
*23:43.880- 23:50.340* :  known as Knam 37 years ago in Kamsamausk. It was the first independent theatre in the Soviet
*23:50.340- 23:57.040* :  Union since the communist crackdown on the arts in the 1920s and it dared to delve into some of
*23:57.040- 24:00.260* :  the unmentionable tragic episodes of recent history.
*24:01.860- 24:06.740* :  On the stage in Vion, Tatiana tries to talk through a glass wall to her grandmother.
*24:07.580- 24:13.660* :  She and five of her 11 children died in the famine of the 1930s caused by the
*24:13.660- 24:15.920* :  forcible collectivisation of agriculture.
*24:22.140- 24:27.480* :  Hunger, poverty and fear, she says, and what my granny passed on to me in her jeans.
*24:28.260- 24:31.600* :  But as freedom of speech was gradually curtailed under Vladimir Putin,
*24:31.600- 24:38.280* :  the authorities in remote Kamsamausk were watching her tiny theatre with only 26 seats
*24:38.720- 24:39.700* :  ever more closely.
*24:43.220- 24:48.260* :  So in our last two years there, we almost stopped performing because friends
*24:49.060- 24:55.800* :  want us, state security, were just waiting for another to arrest us. So we only performed when
*24:55.800- 25:02.160* :  we knew every single person in the audience by name because they were our friends.
*25:04.340- 25:07.920* :  Finally, after Russia's false-scale invasion of Ukraine last year,
*25:08.340- 25:13.520* :  the whole company fled to France where they'd performed before and audiences greet them with
*25:13.760- 25:14.600* :  standing evations.
*25:17.120- 25:21.520* :  Tim Hule reporting and you can hear the full documentary The Life Death and Rebirth of a
*25:21.520- 25:27.140* :  Russian Theatre by going to BBCWorldService.com slash assignment or search for the documentary
*25:27.140- 25:32.700* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts. It could be argued that in the age of TikTok,
*25:32.700- 25:36.640* :  the public appetite for big difficult ideas is a thing of the past.
*25:36.640- 25:41.000* :  But a theoretical physicist whose books have sold millions of copies and whose
*25:41.000- 25:44.940* :  YouTube lectures have been viewed millions of times might beg to differ.
*25:45.620- 25:52.280* :  Dr. Carlo Ravelli's new book is called White Holes. So what's it about? And why is it so popular?
*25:52.640- 25:57.240* :  Amal Rajan spoke to Dr. Ravelli and asked him first to explain what black holes are.
*25:57.900- 26:02.960* :  I think it's one of most spectacular discoveries of the last five or ten years, the fact that
*26:02.960- 26:08.160* :  the universe in which we live is full of this black holes, which are really holes in the sky.
*26:08.160- 26:13.180* :  The universe is not just a uniform extension of space, it's like a colander.
*26:13.380- 26:17.500* :  I mean, there are places where we see matter falling in. Where does this matter go?
*26:17.780- 26:22.180* :  What happened if you fall inside? That's a question that started that's all about white holes.
*26:23.020- 26:27.580* :  It's a speculative idea on which a group of people are working, which is that the black hole
*26:27.580- 26:33.140* :  after a long time turns into a white hole, from which everything that came in is going to come out.
*26:33.440- 26:37.480* :  Black holes are areas of such dense gravity that a little bit of like seeps out of them,
*26:37.480- 26:40.800* :  but not very much. If White Holes emit light, why don't we see lots of them?
*26:40.920- 26:45.780* :  First of all, we don't know how many there are around. The speculation is that maybe in the early
*26:45.780- 26:51.600* :  universe there were a lot of teeny teeny black holes that had the time to sort of end the life
*26:51.600- 26:58.240* :  transform into white holes. So they do emit light to dim to for us to see. However, and again,
*26:58.240- 27:02.820* :  talk about things we are trying to understand. One possibility is that a lot of these white holes
*27:02.820- 27:08.360* :  we actually have already seen them, and it's what astronomers call dark matter. This mysterious
*27:08.360- 27:14.080* :  substance which is around galaxies that nobody knows what it is. Your book is really a meditation
*27:14.080- 27:19.600* :  on the nature of knowledge. Can we ever really know about a region beyond the reach of our
*27:19.600- 27:25.060* :  eyes and our bodies if not our imagination? This is what science is about, I think. We have
*27:25.060- 27:31.220* :  studied the sky far beyond what we see directly. We have studied atoms. We know what happens in the
*27:31.240- 27:36.320* :  very small scales even if we don't see directly. With instrument for that, but besides instrument,
*27:36.320- 27:43.500* :  we also have our brain which has a capacity of mind-traveling, going to places where we cannot
*27:43.500- 27:49.300* :  go directly, using all the knowledge we have, but also using imagination. Imagination is what
*27:49.300- 27:55.800* :  allows us to think if we were there, what we would we see, and on the basis of what we know,
*27:55.800- 28:00.100* :  we can guess, and then out of this guess we can make predictions that we confirmed and then
*28:00.100- 28:04.220* :  confirm their hypothesis. And you also have this idea of unlearning. What is that exactly?
*28:04.340- 28:10.240* :  I think science itself is a constant exercise in metaphors because we create new concepts
*28:10.240- 28:15.560* :  in science by using all concepts and sort of modifying them a little bit. I think that this
*28:15.560- 28:22.440* :  aspect of science, creating new conceptual structure, it's a core of the best science. The weight
*28:22.440- 28:28.220* :  works is by abandoning previous ideas of course, and that's a hard part. The hard part is not
*28:28.220- 28:32.680* :  really inventing something new. It's realizing that something we thought was obvious and clear,
*28:32.680- 28:37.760* :  it's actually not so. And all major scientific advances from, you know,
*28:37.760- 28:43.500* :  darling to Einstein to Copernicus, it's always unlearning something we thought we knew.
*28:43.800- 28:48.880* :  And we are in an era, post-ideological era, in the past there were big ideologies to refer to,
*28:48.880- 28:54.700* :  so a master of thinking you just rely on them. There is not like that anymore. So I think we need
*28:54.700- 29:00.600* :  more people who try to think and produce new ideas. Dr. Carlo Revelli talking to Amal Rajan.
*29:01.340- 29:06.900* :  Returning now to the Gaza conflict and one difficulty, the Israeli defence forces will face if
*29:06.900- 29:13.900* :  and when they go in is the vast network of tunnels underneath the Palestinian territory used by
*29:13.900- 29:20.480* :  Hamas fighters. This week a freed hostage described the area as a spider's web. To find out more
*29:20.480- 29:25.800* :  about what those tunnels looked like Rebecca Kesby spoke to John Spencer, chair of urban warfare
*29:25.800- 29:31.340* :  studies at the U.S. military academy in West Point. The tunnels they call it the underground,
*29:31.340- 29:36.700* :  much like the London underground, believed to be 500 kilometers plus for this city under a city.
*29:36.940- 29:41.680* :  As I study underground warfare around the world from South Korea to Nagorno-Karabakh,
*29:41.820- 29:47.260* :  Hamas tunnels are very unique because of their prefabricated concrete sides and archways
*29:47.260- 29:51.760* :  the top which allows them to dig very fast and in another reason why they have so many of them.
*29:51.880- 29:57.260* :  They're also very deep from five meters to 50 meters down because of the fact that Israel
*29:57.680- 30:02.780* :  over the years and the strategy to combat these had the ability to see and then to hit them with
*30:02.940- 30:08.640* :  bombs. It's like this race now that Hamas has gone down. There are these long, very narrow tunnels
*30:08.640- 30:15.800* :  that open up into big rooms, second hole vehicles, rockets, motorcycles, hospitals, all the command and
*30:15.800- 30:21.360* :  control networks of Hamas. It will be one of the biggest problems that Israel and the idea
*30:21.360- 30:27.520* :  face if they launched a ground invasion. Goodness me, 500 kilometers worth of tunnels. How would
*30:27.520- 30:32.440* :  the Israelis be able to map those tunnels? Will they have an idea of what they look like already?
*30:32.740- 30:37.380* :  Yeah, absolutely. So they've already mapped a lot of it through aerial capabilities,
*30:37.380- 30:43.340* :  from informants, from the Hamas side. They have an idea of where some of them run and their past
*30:43.340- 30:49.500* :  operations have all been somewhat about the tunnels in 2021. They had a response bombing raid,
*30:49.500- 30:54.940* :  two Hamas's rockets and they targeted the tunnel. That's when they realized how much of these tunnels
*30:54.940- 31:00.280* :  are woven into the civilian infrastructure, right? They're underneath the hospitals, they're
*31:00.280- 31:05.640* :  underneath the schools. So in 2021, they bombed and destroyed 60 miles of them and the
*31:05.640- 31:09.280* :  concussion would ripple through the tunnels into other areas of Gaza.
*31:09.540- 31:14.820* :  Yeah, I mean, we see the Israelis bombing extensively, but will those air strikes have any
*31:14.820- 31:19.220* :  impact on the tunnels? Or can the tunnels withstand them? So many of the tunnels can absolutely
*31:19.220- 31:24.960* :  withstand all the bombings, but will close, entrance and exit. It will collapse tunnels. You
*31:24.960- 31:29.940* :  don't solve this problem by bombing it. The bombing helps support a ground invasion and reduces
*31:29.940- 31:35.080* :  the tunnel complex, but some of it you just have to deal with. How would you do it? That's a great
*31:35.080- 31:39.740* :  question. I mean, the hostages, though, present a unique challenge to any research I've ever
*31:39.740- 31:44.700* :  done about what to do about tunnels. In the past, the US forces put tear gas down there. That won't
*31:44.700- 31:48.980* :  happen here because of the perception of using anything like that. Water down there, concrete
*31:49.280- 31:53.820* :  soldiers is the last step. I think it'll be a mix of everything. It'll be a mix of sending robots
*31:53.820- 31:59.860* :  in to see what's in a tunnel before you decide to destroy it or send a soldier in with a ballistic
*31:59.860- 32:04.560* :  shield to try to clear, which is a nightmare for any soldier. The idea of how very unique
*32:04.560- 32:09.520* :  capabilities for tunnels, but there's no one solution. It'll be a situational waste normal approach.
*32:09.920- 32:14.000* :  In the end, I think they'll destroy all the tunnels and one of the options is a very realistic
*32:14.000- 32:18.960* :  option is to horizontally drill from the Mediterranean Sea and connect the sea to the tunnel
*32:18.960- 32:23.500* :  complex and that way they'll never be used again. Retired army officer John Spencer.
*32:26.060- 32:30.480* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast very soon.
*32:30.480- 32:34.860* :  This one was mixed by Chris Hanson and produced by Emma Joseph, our editors Karen Martin.
*32:34.860- 32:37.120* :  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
