*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.520* :  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.300- 00:22.540* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Thursday,
*00:22.540- 00:27.920* :  the 26th of October. The Israeli Prime Minister says Israel is still preparing to invade
*00:27.920- 00:33.840* :  Gaza despite calls for restraint. I want to be clear about the timing of the offensive.
*00:33.840- 00:38.920* :  It will be determined unanimously by the war cabinet. We are working to ensure the best
*00:38.920- 00:44.740* :  conditions for our fighters and the coming operation. The UN boss says his recent comments about
*00:44.740- 00:50.660* :  the Hamas attack not happening in a vacuum were misinterpreted. I spoke of the grievances of the
*00:50.660- 00:55.760* :  Palestinian people. I also clearly stated, but the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot
*00:55.760- 01:00.840* :  justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. We hear from Israel.
*01:03.720- 01:08.660* :  Also in the podcast, after three weeks of paralysis, Republicans in the US Congress finally
*01:08.660- 01:15.900* :  elect a new house speaker, Trump supporter Mike Johnson, and our Gen Z the most prudish ever.
*01:21.120- 01:25.040* :  Israel's powerful military has reportedly been ready to launch an invasion of
*01:25.040- 01:30.360* :  Gaza for at least 10 days, but the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to give the order
*01:30.360- 01:36.080* :  to go in. On Wednesday evening, the Israeli leader again insisted troops were preparing for a
*01:36.080- 01:41.140* :  ground offensive, but he didn't give any details other than saying the timing would be reached by
*01:41.140- 01:47.540* :  consensus. I want to be clear about the timing of the offensive. It will be determined unanimously
*01:47.540- 01:53.220* :  by the war cabinet, together with Benny Gans, the chief of staff. We are working to ensure the
*01:53.320- 01:58.920* :  best conditions for our fighters in the coming operation. We are determined that Hamas and ISIS
*01:59.460- 02:02.800* :  pay the full price for carrying out their horrific atrocities.
*02:06.340- 02:11.120* :  Israel has come under pressure to rethink its invasion plans, with the French President
*02:11.120- 02:15.840* :  saying it will be an error to launch a, quote, massive ground incursion, and the US
*02:15.840- 02:21.440* :  reportedly calling for delay. In his televised address, Mr. Netanyahu said Israel had already
*02:21.440- 02:28.140* :  killed, quote, thousands of terrorists. But it's clear that many Palestinians' civilians have
*02:28.140- 02:34.000* :  died in the airstrikes, including some who had followed Israeli orders to evacuate to Southern
*02:34.000- 02:38.500* :  Gaza. Among those killed with a family of the Al-Jazeera Gaza correspondent,
*02:38.500- 02:44.880* :  Wael Dardou, who was pictured holding the body of a baby. The BBC correspondent, Rusty Abu Aluf,
*02:44.880- 02:50.300* :  who's currently in Southern Gaza at the NASA hospital, gave my colleague Evan Davis an update
*02:50.300- 02:55.280* :  of the situation there. People are struggling to find water, yes. We are struggling to find food.
*02:55.360- 03:01.180* :  I saw people trying to find food in the garbage. Small kids are coming to our BBC here,
*03:01.180- 03:07.140* :  operation and begging for water. I saw very long queues on the bakeries and on the supermarket,
*03:07.140- 03:13.420* :  most of the supermarket shelves are empty. But I don't think we are starving yet. But for how long
*03:13.420- 03:20.380* :  this small place, very overcrowded, can live without any humanitarian corridor. For how long they
*03:20.380- 03:25.920* :  will hold, not sure about it. Rusty, am I hearing a buzzing over you? Is that a drone? Is that a
*03:25.920- 03:35.060* :  constant presence? What is that? Very annoying buzzing drone. Right, that's not a drone. I don't know.
*03:36.080- 03:41.100* :  Are you okay? You're ducking? I can actually see you, Rusty, because we have a sky plane open.
*03:41.100- 03:46.000* :  Yeah, I think it's an asteroid somewhere around this. How often does that happen, Rusty?
*03:46.000- 03:51.440* :  I mean, is that a shocking sound to you now or is that familiar sound? Not really. This is maybe
*03:51.440- 03:56.600* :  the fifth or sixth time today. Every day there is bombing around this location. The hospital is
*03:56.600- 04:02.420* :  in central Hanyunis and Hanyunis is the second largest city and it's been hit hard in the last
*04:02.420- 04:09.640* :  couple of days. Tins of asteroids across the Hanyunis area, which housing like 400,000 people,
*04:09.640- 04:15.540* :  regional residents, and about 600,000 more. So about million people, about half of the population,
*04:15.580- 04:20.760* :  they live in this place and they live with this sound of drone buzzing day and night and with the
*04:20.760- 04:26.400* :  air strikes. The mood here is very angry mood in Gaza. People are squeezed into the corner with
*04:26.400- 04:32.360* :  no option. People are trying to secure any sort of food or water for their kids to survive.
*04:32.760- 04:37.940* :  Of course, Israel is targeting Hamas, but always the human coast of this conflict is huge.
*04:38.300- 04:41.320* :  More than half of those killed are women and children.
*04:41.700- 04:47.900* :  The BBC correspondent in Gaza, Rusty Abu Alouf, talking to Evan Davis. William Schomburg, head of
*04:47.900- 04:53.340* :  the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza, has spoken to the BBC for the first time since
*04:53.340- 04:58.680* :  the deadly Hamas attack of the 7th of October. This is what he told news hours, Julian Marshall.
*04:59.100- 05:04.780* :  The humanitarian conditions right now in Gaza are quite dire, frankly. I was able to visit
*05:04.860- 05:13.080* :  a couple of hospitals in recent days, overcrowding patients in the corridors and hospitals have
*05:13.080- 05:19.620* :  now also been turned into makeshift camps for displaced persons who fear that they are not safe
*05:19.620- 05:24.420* :  anywhere else apart from in the hospitals. And where does the International Committee of the
*05:24.420- 05:31.060* :  Red Cross come into all of this? The ACRC has operated in Gaza for several decades. Right now,
*05:31.060- 05:38.320* :  our focus is on trying to ensure the safe and continued flow of humanitarian assistance and
*05:38.320- 05:44.460* :  personnel that's required for us to meet needs of communities that have been impacted by the
*05:44.460- 05:52.260* :  hostilities. We finally will be able to have trucks and some staff entering shortly into Gaza.
*05:52.260- 05:58.400* :  This is our latest understanding. It has been challenging. And of course, the initial assistance
*05:58.460- 06:02.580* :  that we will be able to bring into the Gaza Strip is a drop in the ocean of what is required.
*06:03.400- 06:09.720* :  Could I ask about your staff and the kind of conditions that they're having to work under?
*06:09.720- 06:15.200* :  I know that UNRA have lost several dozen staff as a result of the Israeli air strike.
*06:15.200- 06:19.620* :  So you're in a similar situation. I have several staff members who are unaccounted for
*06:19.620- 06:26.280* :  and I have one, unfortunately, for whom we presume the worth in terms of the team of international
*06:26.280- 06:31.120* :  staff that we have. It's very challenging working conditions. We have to relocate from our office
*06:31.120- 06:36.500* :  in Gaza City and we are currently in a temporary office that we are also all sleeping in together
*06:37.220- 06:42.180* :  and trying our best to find solutions for both our team as well as for our operation.
*06:42.540- 06:47.780* :  I mean, how do you yourself find that continuous Israeli bombardment?
*06:48.220- 06:54.480* :  The hostilities are difficult to deal with. It's not easy for many of our staff to listen to
*06:54.480- 06:59.900* :  air strikes going on around them and I really feel much more for my colleagues that have
*06:59.920- 07:05.460* :  children because they are the ones that are having to look after them and explain to them
*07:05.460- 07:10.780* :  in as calm a way as possible as to what's going on and to try and alleviate some of their fears
*07:10.780- 07:15.600* :  and it's really them who I think are more. William Schumberg talking to Julian Marshall.
*07:16.380- 07:22.720* :  Earlier, I got an update on Israel's military plans and first the humanitarian situation in Gaza
*07:22.720- 07:29.080* :  from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams. It is deteriorating all the time. The air strikes,
*07:29.080- 07:34.620* :  as you just heard, very graphically illustrated there during Rushdie's report. Those are going on
*07:34.620- 07:39.760* :  all the time throughout the Gaza Strip and we've also heard from the UN who that have been kind
*07:39.760- 07:46.120* :  of counting down to today as the day when they reckon they will finally run out of fuel.
*07:46.360- 07:51.040* :  And as a result of that, the UN is saying it's going to have to start limiting its operations
*07:51.040- 07:58.080* :  which look after the interests of some 600,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip but also hundreds
*07:58.080- 08:03.060* :  of thousands of others who are not technically refugees. So the UN is facing an enormous
*08:03.060- 08:07.560* :  and mounting humanitarian challenge and without fuel they say they can't do it.
*08:07.720- 08:12.280* :  They do say that that moment is coming. Now the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
*08:12.280- 08:18.560* :  once again said that Israel is preparing for a ground invasion without specifying when it might
*08:18.560- 08:24.440* :  happen are all these international calls for restraints perhaps having an effect on the timetable.
*08:24.940- 08:29.880* :  It's very hard to know. I mean he went on television tonight Mr Netanyahu in a prime time address
*08:30.140- 08:34.420* :  which left I think a lot of people scratching their heads. He did say that the government and the
*08:34.420- 08:40.840* :  chief of staff of the army had agreed unanimously on the timing of a ground invasion but that's not
*08:40.840- 08:46.340* :  quite the same as saying a date has been set and he certainly gave no indication as to when that
*08:46.340- 08:51.580* :  moment would come. We've been hearing lots of talk about humanitarian pauses the Americans,
*08:51.580- 08:57.360* :  the Canadians and I think some European governments have been urging some kind of pause in hostilities.
*08:57.580- 09:03.600* :  We've also been hearing that the United States may be asking for a delay as it gets some of its
*09:03.600- 09:10.920* :  own defenses in place in the region because America has all sorts of military bases dotted around
*09:10.920- 09:14.820* :  the Middle East and the Gulf and there's some suggestion that they want to make sure all of that
*09:14.820- 09:20.880* :  is properly protected because of course there is this lingering fear that an escalation of violence
*09:20.880- 09:26.200* :  in the Gaza Strip could trigger some wider conflict. For whatever reasons it does seem as though
*09:26.200- 09:32.340* :  this is still somewhat on hold the hostage issue of course is another factor in all of that so
*09:32.340- 09:37.440* :  we could be in this holding pattern for some time to come. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Meanwhile the
*09:37.440- 09:43.880* :  UN Security Council in New York has rejected two opposing US and Russian drafted resolutions
*09:43.880- 09:49.900* :  that had sought to pause the fighting between Israel and Hamas and open the flow of humanitarian aid
*09:49.900- 09:55.720* :  into Gaza. We'll hear more about that in a moment but Israel is still furious about comments from
*09:55.720- 10:02.520* :  the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday that the Hamas attack didn't happen in a vacuum.
*10:03.200- 10:06.600* :  On Wednesday in New York he said his comments had been misinterpreted.
*10:07.100- 10:14.820* :  I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council
*10:15.180- 10:22.500* :  as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas. This is false it was the opposite.
*10:23.320- 10:28.320* :  However in response Israel's UN ambassador said it was a disgrace that the Secretary General
*10:28.320- 10:34.560* :  hadn't retracted his words or apologized and again called on him to resign. Well let's return to
*10:34.560- 10:41.220* :  those two failed votes on passing a UN resolution on the Israel Gaza conflict. At least nine votes
*10:41.220- 10:46.860* :  are required and no vetoes by the permanent members of the council, the US, France, Britain,
*10:46.860- 10:53.020* :  Russia or China for it to be adopted. Our correspondence in New York, Netta al-Feeq, has the latest.
*10:53.520- 10:58.480* :  This is the fourth time now that the Security Council has failed to act on the desperate humanitarian
*10:58.480- 11:04.080* :  concerns in Gaza. This was actually Russia's second attempt at a resolution. The United States had
*11:04.240- 11:09.120* :  previously vetoed a resolution and then put forward their own and here we are with both of their
*11:09.120- 11:15.800* :  attempts failing. First up was that US drafted resolution which called for humanitarian pauses but
*11:16.200- 11:21.960* :  crucially it did with the West wanted which was to put language in expressing countries right
*11:21.960- 11:28.760* :  to self-defense without naming Israel directly. But Russia and China vetoed that draft. They said it
*11:28.760- 11:33.540* :  did not call for a ceasefire which is what UN officials what Arab countries are calling for
*11:33.540- 11:40.080* :  and they said it would give a green light to further escalation of the war and also notable was
*11:40.080- 11:46.720* :  the fact that the UAE which really represents the Arab countries on the council said that the priority
*11:46.720- 11:52.400* :  of any resolution had to be valuing Palestinian life equally to Israeli life and she said that the
*11:52.400- 11:57.620* :  council couldn't be silent on issues of forced displacement and couldn't be ambiguous about the
*11:57.620- 12:03.720* :  fact that the Gaza Strip was occupied territory. So she felt that was missing from the resolution.
*12:03.820- 12:10.780* :  We then had a vote on Russia's draft which didn't even get enough support in the council to pass
*12:10.780- 12:15.460* :  and we heard the United States slamming Russia saying they were just trying to score political
*12:15.460- 12:20.480* :  points. They hadn't really consulted with members and they just wanted to divide the council.
*12:21.120- 12:26.740* :  So we really saw these geopolitical tensions playing out in the council and yet again unable to
*12:26.740- 12:36.660* :  really act despite the pleas from UN officials. Now some other news and just over three weeks after
*12:36.660- 12:41.760* :  U.S. Republicans ejected their own Kevin McCarthy speaker of the House of Representatives.
*12:41.820- 12:47.780* :  They've finally settled on a replacement. The ousting of the party's most senior elected politician
*12:47.780- 12:52.820* :  caused paralysis in the U.S. Congress while highlighting divisions among the Republicans.
*12:53.740- 13:00.160* :  They rejected three candidates before finally settling on Mike Johnson, a right-wing Trump supporter.
*13:00.440- 13:04.000* :  Our Washington correspondent David Willis told me more about the new speaker.
*13:04.400- 13:11.540* :  Mike Johnson secured the 217 votes that he needed to be elected the 56th speaker
*13:12.040- 13:18.460* :  of the House of Representatives doing what three previous party nominees had tried to do.
*13:18.460- 13:24.860* :  Of course, but failed, namely again the support both of mainstream Republicans and members of
*13:24.860- 13:32.140* :  the hard right of the party which had taken turns if you like in sinking previous speaker candidates.
*13:32.640- 13:38.740* :  He's the most junior lawmaker in decades to be elected speaker and he may also be as you
*13:38.740- 13:45.320* :  pointed out the most conservative, Mr. Johnson, opposes abortion rights and same sex marriage
*13:45.320- 13:53.580* :  and he is a staunch supporter and close ally of Donald Trump and he led an unsuccessful appeal
*13:54.080- 13:58.940* :  by a number of House Republicans following the 2020 presidential election to get the U.S.
*13:58.940- 14:05.820* :  Supreme Court to overturn election results in states that Donald Trump had lost that effort,
*14:05.820- 14:11.880* :  of course, ultimately proved unsuccessful. Will he be any more successful managing internal
*14:11.880- 14:17.240* :  Republican divisions than Kevin McCarthy was? That's a very good question and it is going to be
*14:17.240- 14:23.660* :  a real battle, I think, for Mr. Johnson as he seeks both to unite this party which has been
*14:23.660- 14:29.780* :  tearing itself apart over the course of the last three weeks since the former speaker Kevin
*14:29.780- 14:35.620* :  McCarthy was removed following that right-wing revolt and hold on to his own position.
*14:36.060- 14:41.680* :  It's going to be a baptism of fire for him. As I mentioned, he's not the most experienced
*14:41.680- 14:49.620* :  lawmaker by any means and he will immediately be called on to preside over a possible government
*14:49.620- 14:56.560* :  shutdown that could threaten his job unless he can cut a budget deal favorable to his party
*14:56.560- 15:03.500* :  and also acceptable to the Democrats. David Willis in Washington. In our earlier global news
*15:03.500- 15:08.420* :  podcast, we reported on a major hurricane slamming into the Mexican resort of Accaporco.
*15:09.060- 15:14.800* :  While let's see, Otis was a category five storm the most powerful and it crashed ashore with
*15:14.800- 15:20.440* :  winds of around 260 kilometers an hour. The storm has now weakened but there have been flash floods
*15:20.440- 15:26.860* :  and landslides and extremely destructive winds. Vanessa Bouchluta, our online Latin America
*15:26.860- 15:32.520* :  and Caribbean editor, gave me an update. The Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador,
*15:32.520- 15:38.100* :  has been speaking about this hurricane and he said that communications with the state of Guerrero
*15:38.560- 15:44.560* :  where the hurricane made landfall has been completely broken. So there are no official reports
*15:44.560- 15:49.840* :  of casualties. The president said he didn't know whether there were any fatalities. The information
*15:49.920- 15:55.240* :  that we have been getting is from people who have been able to record videos from their hotels
*15:55.240- 16:00.620* :  where they were staying in this resort town and the damage that you see there is quite extensive.
*16:00.620- 16:06.440* :  A lot of windows were blown in by the strength of the wind and the facade of one shopping
*16:06.440- 16:12.520* :  center seems to have completely ripped off. Otis, this hurricane, went from a tropical storm to a
*16:12.520- 16:20.160* :  category five in just 12 hours and it hit at 25 minutes past midnight so in the middle of the night.
*16:20.160- 16:25.020* :  So a lot of people would have gone to bed thinking that yes there was a tropical storm but it was
*16:25.040- 16:30.940* :  off the coast and it would probably take quite a long time to reach their town and suddenly
*16:30.940- 16:36.520* :  next thing they knew was that their windows were blown in. The mayor of the town of Acapulco
*16:36.520- 16:42.640* :  said that people who weren't in houses that were strong enough should remain put but those who
*16:42.640- 16:48.540* :  were in flimsy shacks should definitely try to seek shelter. But some videos have been shared
*16:48.540- 16:53.740* :  of people who were trying to reach shelters and then couldn't leave the bus they were in because
*16:53.740- 16:57.840* :  the strength of the wind was such that it was just too dangerous to leave the bus.
*16:58.140- 17:01.300* :  The online Latin America and Caribbean editor Vanessa Bushlutter.
*17:04.280- 17:06.040* :  Still to come on the global news podcast?
*17:06.320- 17:10.860* :  I never really expected to be able to look in her eyes for example and think that this person
*17:10.860- 17:17.580* :  could simply start talking. Scientists recreate the face of a Peruvian woman sacrificed 500 years
*17:20.620- 17:20.640* :  again.
*17:26.340- 17:31.800* :  The rival army factions who have been battling for control of Sudan for half a year say they will
*17:31.800- 17:36.720* :  return to peace talks in the Saudi city of Jeddah. The fighting between the regular armed forces
*17:36.720- 17:42.340* :  and the rival paramilitary rapid support forces has left more than 9,000 people dead
*17:42.340- 17:48.020* :  and five and a half million homeless. The US and Saudi broken negotiations are due to begin
*17:48.020- 17:53.980* :  on Thursday. So why have the two signs agreed to resume talking now? I asked our Africa regional
*17:53.980- 18:00.360* :  editor Richard Hamilton. Well the army said that they'd accepted this invitation from the Saudis
*18:00.360- 18:06.680* :  and the US out of a belief that negotiation is one of the means that may end the conflict
*18:06.680- 18:12.460* :  and the paramilitary the RSF for their part they've already arrived in Jeddah and they said
*18:12.680- 18:18.660* :  that was in the hope of reaching a solution that will stop the war and end the suffering of our
*18:18.660- 18:24.540* :  people but they don't seem to have cared very much for their people up to now. There's signs that
*18:24.540- 18:31.840* :  both sides are flagging on the battlefield. The pace of fighting has slowed down in the past week.
*18:31.840- 18:37.740* :  They both resorted to long-range missiles and military analysts are saying that the army has
*18:37.740- 18:43.880* :  struggled to repair old war planes and the paramilitary the RSF are finding it difficult to treat
*18:43.880- 18:49.400* :  wounded soldiers but that may be because they've looted all the hospitals and assaulted doctors
*18:49.660- 18:56.900* :  and both sides are struggling to pay their rather exhausted forces. Now in the early days of the
*18:57.160- 19:01.680* :  conflict the first weeks and months we saw a number of ceasefires agreed and then almost immediately
*19:01.680- 19:07.440* :  collapse. What are the chances of success of these latest negotiations? People will
*19:07.440- 19:13.120* :  probably be rightly cynical because as you say in May and June those torts collapsed and the
*19:13.120- 19:19.200* :  Saudis and the Americans were very exasperated with that. They felt that the negotiations were
*19:19.200- 19:25.060* :  conducted in bad faith and were just delaying tactics but I think the war will probably end at
*19:25.060- 19:30.160* :  some point. I mean if you look at what happens in South Sudan they came to a power-sharing
*19:30.160- 19:36.900* :  arrangement but not before something like 400,000 people were killed. It looks as if an outright
*19:36.900- 19:43.140* :  victory for either side is no longer a prospect so we're seeing this war of attrition probably
*19:43.180- 19:49.640* :  fizzle out. There's some suggestion that loyalists of the previous leader Omar al-Bashir they want
*19:49.640- 19:55.940* :  to fight on so the army is a bit divided they've got nothing to lose and civilians are crucially
*19:55.940- 20:02.620* :  are not yet part of this peace process in Jeddah. Richard Hamilton. Now to a three-year-old mystery that
*20:02.620- 20:08.460* :  has puzzled scientists white hundreds of elephants dropped dead in southern Africa in 2020.
*20:08.620- 20:17.340* :  350 died in Botswana between May and June then another 35 in Zimbabwe. Elephants of all ages and both
*20:17.340- 20:23.200* :  sexes were affected with many walking in circles before collapsing on their faces. Now researchers
*20:23.200- 20:28.100* :  think they may have worked out why. Our science correspondent Victoria Gill has more.
*20:28.440- 20:31.220* :  The scientists who made this discovery were investigating the sudden
*20:31.220- 20:38.220* :  mysterious deaths of 35 elephants mostly between August and September 2020 in Northwestern Zimbabwe
*20:38.720- 20:44.000* :  wearing protective clothing and extreme heat the team of vets and scientists carried out post-mortem
*20:44.000- 20:50.040* :  examinations on 15 elephants. They managed to confirm that 13 of the animals had septicemia or
*20:50.040- 20:54.860* :  blood poisoning when they died and in six of the bodies they pinned down a potential cause
*20:55.120- 21:01.640* :  identifying a bacterium called Biscard Taxon 45. It's a type never seen before in African elephants
*21:01.640- 21:06.300* :  but it has been found previously in swabs taken from other species at sites where they've been
*21:06.300- 21:12.320* :  bitten by tigers or lions. The researchers who are from Zimbabwe, South Africa and the UK think
*21:12.320- 21:16.700* :  severe drought and shortage of food that year could have compromised the elephant's health
*21:17.140- 21:22.040* :  which allowed the infection to overcome their immune defenses. Dr Chris Foggin, a vet from Victoria
*21:22.040- 21:27.060* :  Falls Wildlife Trust and a leading member of the team says he anticipates more outbreaks in the
*21:27.060- 21:32.400* :  future particularly in a changing climate. We won't be surprised if we see this condition again.
*21:33.780- 21:40.900* :  We we expect it when the elephants are particularly stressed in the hot dry season which is right now
*21:40.900- 21:46.300* :  in fact three years down the line. It has the capacity to kill large numbers of animals.
*21:46.780- 21:50.940* :  The researchers hope to do more work to understand exactly what led to this outbreak
*21:51.400- 21:55.540* :  and to come up with ways to intervene to prevent this newly discovered threat to African
*21:55.540- 22:01.000* :  Savannah elephants. Our science correspondent Victoria Gill. She's known as Juanita or the
*22:01.040- 22:05.100* :  Inca Ice Maiden, the mummy of a young woman thought to have been sacrificed in a ritual
*22:05.100- 22:11.360* :  five hundred years ago in what is modern day Peru. Glad in a ceremonial tunic and a headpiece
*22:11.720- 22:16.680* :  Juanita has become a major tourist attraction in the Andean Sanctuary's Museum in the town of
*22:16.680- 22:23.480* :  Araquípa. Her features are barely distinguishable but Juanita has now been given a new face by
*22:23.480- 22:28.800* :  scientists who wanted to show what she might have looked like five centuries ago. Julian Marshall
*22:28.800- 22:34.660* :  spoke to Dr. Demara Socha who was involved in the facial reconstruction and archaeologist Dr.
*22:34.660- 22:40.960* :  Johan Reinhardt who discovered the mummy in 1995. I didn't think they would be able to make a
*22:40.960- 22:47.660* :  reproduction of such a quality of being alive. That's a special kind of craftsmanship in which you
*22:47.660- 22:53.260* :  can create sort of a living presence. So I never really expected to be able to look in her eyes,
*22:53.260- 22:58.300* :  for example, and think that this person could simply start talking. And it's quite a haunting
*22:58.300- 23:05.860* :  image, the idea that it's looking at you across five hundred years. The idea behind it was to try
*23:05.860- 23:12.480* :  and have this pensive look on her face as she's about to await her fate. She knew that it was meant
*23:12.480- 23:17.140* :  to be a great honor but of course you're also in a situation that she would have never been in before.
*23:17.760- 23:23.280* :  She's on the summit of a 21,000 foot peak must have been feeling the altitude and so forth
*23:23.920- 23:30.200* :  but certainly considering that she was about to die, she would be looking out rather
*23:30.200- 23:36.860* :  pensively and that's what the sculptor Oscar Nielsen was trying to get that sort of effect across.
*23:37.520- 23:42.440* :  Why was she being sacrificed all those years ago? Well, we don't know the exact reason but we know
*23:42.440- 23:46.920* :  there are several reasons for doing the human sacrifice. This could follow, for example, the death
*23:46.920- 23:53.260* :  of an ecanemprer. In general terms, this royal sacrifice was done at times of extreme stress.
*23:53.260- 23:59.560* :  In the case of Anpato where we found this woman, we know that there was a volcanic eruption that
*23:59.560- 24:04.480* :  had taken place just before the Incas made sacrifices there and we also know that it had to have been
*24:04.480- 24:09.840* :  three of ice when they constructed her burial on a summit ridge and that could only happen with
*24:09.840- 24:14.880* :  extreme climate change. Would she have been drugged? We know that she had been chewing
*24:14.880- 24:23.580* :  coca leaves. Dr. Sarcha, how were you able to get such a faithful reconstruction of this young
*24:23.580- 24:28.960* :  woman's face? In this case, we use the Manchester technique that is based on the reconstruction
*24:28.960- 24:37.680* :  of the mosques and then of the soft tissues. I'm disinvolved skull measurements, DNA studies,
*24:37.980- 24:44.780* :  ethnological characteristics. We made the computed tomography of herds so we can have the model
*24:44.780- 24:51.500* :  of her school and then we print it so Oscar Nielsen could work directly on the replica.
*24:52.200- 24:58.260* :  In the case of Juanita we have the information about her hairstyle, for example, that we could recreate.
*24:58.260- 25:06.120* :  We cooperation with the center of traditional textiles from Chinchero in Cusco and they made handmade
*25:06.120- 25:13.400* :  textiles, the replica of the original ones so we try to have all components to have this
*25:13.420- 25:19.040* :  reconstruction much close to true as possible. And of course, I should point out that she has a
*25:19.040- 25:24.520* :  cloak draped over her shoulders. That's what you're talking about. That has also been made for her.
*25:24.600- 25:30.640* :  Talk and the headdress. Doctors, Demara, Socha and Johann Reinhardt talking to Julian Marshall.
*25:31.220- 25:35.260* :  Now, if you've ever watched TV shows like Euphoria, Sex, Educational, Bridgerton,
*25:35.260- 25:40.540* :  you may have been surprised by their rather daring approach to romance. But a new study has
*25:40.540- 25:46.760* :  found that people between the ages of 10 and 24, or Gen Z, as they're known, could be switching off
*25:46.760- 25:50.660* :  when sex is shown on screen. Our reporter, Madeline Drury, has the details.
*25:56.080- 26:00.400* :  You might not want to watch Netflix's sex education in the same room as your parents.
*26:00.400- 26:06.460* :  And if you're in Gen Z, you might not want to watch these kind of sex scenes at all. Almost half
*26:06.460- 26:11.740* :  of young people think sex and romance are too prominent on screen. Me and my friends often feel
*26:11.740- 26:17.820* :  uncomfortable. My friends and I maybe awkwardly bear through it. Research is from the University of
*26:17.820- 26:24.600* :  California in the United States spoke to young people born between 1997 and 2012 who said instead,
*26:24.600- 26:29.640* :  they want to see more friendships and platonic relationships. We could have a trace in the
*26:29.640- 26:35.420* :  few months. Sorry. It comes at a time when there has been praise for advancements in the portrayal
*26:35.420- 26:41.320* :  of intimacy on shows like the BBC's Normal People. I'm much too self conscious.
*26:41.680- 26:46.460* :  The researchers say this shows young people just want to see more diverse relationships while
*26:46.460- 26:51.880* :  they binge watch. In fact, some said they'd like to see more aromantic or asexual characters.
*26:51.880- 26:57.000* :  That's people who do not experience romantic or sexual attraction. And in the real world,
*26:57.000- 27:02.020* :  other studies have found young people are having less sex than their parents did at their age.
*27:02.460- 27:09.040* :  When it comes to dating, one study found that 44% of Gen Z would rather clean a toilet than go on
*27:09.040- 27:15.080* :  a date arranged online. Another generational shift could be a foot too. Youth drinking is in decline,
*27:15.080- 27:20.520* :  across many high-income countries in Western Europe and North America. Here in the United Kingdom,
*27:20.520- 27:26.920* :  16 to 25-year-olds are more likely to be T-total than any other age group. They say they're worried
*27:26.920- 27:32.340* :  about health, and alcohol is not as cheap as it used to be. Madeline, Drury, and you can hear more
*27:32.340- 27:38.580* :  stories like that on the BBC's Reliable Source podcast. Now returning to our main news, the ongoing
*27:38.580- 27:44.300* :  conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has seen a sharp increase in hate crimes against
*27:44.300- 27:49.500* :  both Muslims and Jews here in London, according to recent figures from the Metropolitan Police.
*27:50.260- 27:55.480* :  But in a display of unity, an interfaith group has held a peace vigil in the UK capital.
*27:56.160- 28:02.420* :  Nisa Nashim, which means woman in Arabic and Hebrew, brings together women from both faiths.
*28:02.680- 28:04.320* :  Shabnam Mahmoud went to meet them.
*28:04.840- 28:06.940* :  Hashjibah
*28:10.120- 28:12.840* :  Jewish prayers and Islamic prayers.
*28:17.260- 28:23.240* :  The Nisa Nashim group of Jewish and Muslim women from around the country are holding a vigil
*28:23.240- 28:28.820* :  to pray, grieve, and share the pain of the current conflicts between Israel and Gaza.
*28:29.120- 28:34.320* :  I just wanted to really appreciate all of you for even coming to them.
*28:34.320- 28:40.400* :  Most of them are on Zoom, but a few are at the North London home of the group's co-founder, Laura Marx.
*28:40.540- 28:43.620* :  We had to bring people together today to say we're all in pain.
*28:43.780- 28:48.960* :  It's still hard to bring two very different fighting communities together.
*28:49.560- 28:55.680* :  Our women don't fight. There's so many fantastic women out there who just want to say,
*28:55.680- 28:59.960* :  look, we're still friends. What's going on over there? There's nothing we can do about it,
*28:59.960- 29:03.960* :  but we can stop ourselves tearing ourselves apart here in Britain.
*29:04.460- 29:09.480* :  And building friendships is the main aim of the group, which formed almost six years ago.
*29:09.700- 29:13.520* :  We need to show that we can stick together in light of any differences that we have.
*29:13.840- 29:18.980* :  This is Shazia. This is a safe space that we can say what we feel and we can have a dialogue
*29:18.980- 29:22.300* :  with other people who don't maybe have the same views as us.
*29:22.560- 29:24.880* :  University student Rebecca agrees.
*29:25.260- 29:28.280* :  It's been very difficult, especially on campus.
*29:28.280- 29:32.800* :  There's been a lot of division, a lot of negative talk, and a place like this at Nassana Shem,
*29:33.200- 29:37.220* :  the community that we've built together has been really empowering and nurturing
*29:37.260- 29:40.640* :  in a way that I believe is really special and is difficult to find elsewhere.
*29:42.740- 29:46.500* :  Over teen cake, the group listened to more prayers and poetry.
*29:51.660- 29:55.200* :  Actually, the moderators on the groups for Nassana Shem have been very good
*29:55.520- 29:58.640* :  at being able to try and not to share things from social media,
*29:58.640- 30:03.920* :  but talking from our own spaces and how we feel, but always in a considerate manner.
*30:04.300- 30:08.080* :  And trying to come together again using our similarities rather than our differences
*30:08.480- 30:10.660* :  to build on networks and make them even stronger.
*30:10.920- 30:14.320* :  The similarities are in our belief in God, in our prayers.
*30:14.940- 30:18.000* :  We are cousins in terms of our religious backgrounds,
*30:18.400- 30:23.320* :  and so to shame that we create differences where there doesn't need to be any.
*30:24.000- 30:28.680* :  So we are going to light a candle and just have a moment for quiet.
*30:31.000- 30:32.840* :  That report by Shabnam Mahmoud.
*30:35.700- 30:39.200* :  That's all from us for now, but the Global News podcast will be back very soon.
*30:39.200- 30:42.680* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Emma Joseph,
*30:42.680- 30:45.240* :  by Editors Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway.
*30:45.240- 30:46.600* :  Until next time, goodbye.
