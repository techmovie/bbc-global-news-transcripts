*00:36.800- 00:44.960* :  World Service. I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Monday the 30th of October, these are our
*00:44.960- 00:50.720* :  main stories. Eight agencies say it's impossible to evacuate a crowded hospital in the Gaza Strip
*00:51.040- 00:56.860* :  after Israel's military reportedly warned everyone there to leave. The authorities in the
*00:56.860- 01:02.560* :  Russian Republic of Dagestan have opened a criminal investigation into the storming of an airport
*01:02.560- 01:09.420* :  by a mob searching for Israeli citizens. Mexican officials say it will take months to clear
*01:09.420- 01:14.480* :  all the debris from the centre of Acapulco which was hit by a hurricane on Wednesday.
*01:17.640- 01:21.100* :  Also in this podcast? Hey, anybody know a good tailor?
*01:21.340- 01:25.360* :  You need some clothes altered? No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
*01:26.860- 01:32.720* :  Tributes have poured in for the actor Matthew Perry, best known for starring in the TV sitcom Friends
*01:33.220- 01:35.560* :  after his death at the age of 54.
*01:35.560- 01:45.220* :  The World Health Organization says it's deeply concerned by reports of Israeli calls for the
*01:45.220- 01:52.500* :  evacuation of a key hospital in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes have reportedly been landing about 20
*01:52.500- 01:59.240* :  metres from the Al-Quds facility. Eight agencies have warned that evacuating the site is impossible.
*01:59.260- 02:05.520* :  The hospital is treating hundreds of people, some of whom are too ill or frail to be moved.
*02:05.580- 02:11.320* :  On top of this, about 14,000 people who have been made homeless by the Israeli bombardment
*02:11.320- 02:16.800* :  are thought to have sought refuge there. The Director General of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society,
*02:16.800- 02:21.980* :  Marwan Jalani, which runs the hospital, says that they've been getting repeated warnings all day
*02:21.980- 02:28.900* :  to evacuate the facility. We have people in intensive care units. We have infants in
*02:29.020- 02:35.380* :  incubators. We cannot move them. There are no means to move them, not the vehicles,
*02:35.380- 02:41.280* :  not the fuel, and the roads are totally destroyed. On top of this, of course, you have 14,000
*02:41.280- 02:47.020* :  people who we have informed them of the threat. We have informed them that we have received
*02:47.020- 02:54.840* :  these messages, but they have chosen to stay. As WTO said, moving infants in incubators or
*02:54.840- 03:01.580* :  intensive care unit patients, would be a death sentence for them. The BBC's Ruchti Abu Aluf is
*03:01.580- 03:06.560* :  in southern Gaza and gave us this update. It's quite hard in Hanyunis, convening with the
*03:06.560- 03:13.840* :  previous days, but in Gaza, Al-Quds Hospital, run by the Palestinian ICRC, is making the headline
*03:13.840- 03:19.220* :  tonight. As Israel pushing guard towards the hospital, hundreds of air strikes in the
*03:19.220- 03:24.360* :  last couple of days, but today they are very close, damaging some of the hospital properties.
*03:25.040- 03:30.620* :  We received a video from one of the people trapped inside the hospital showing a huge smoke
*03:30.620- 03:37.540* :  inside and dust inside the hospital. The medical team are distributing masks to the people
*03:38.620- 03:44.640* :  about 14,000 people, according to the director of the hospital, are taking the hospital as
*03:44.640- 03:50.820* :  refuge because earlier footage shows the scale of destruction around the hospital is huge,
*03:50.820- 03:55.200* :  but now they are pushing hard to the hospital, damaging some of their properties, but
*03:55.620- 04:00.200* :  it's still not direct to Al-Quds Hospital, only very close to it.
*04:00.760- 04:06.460* :  Ruchti Abu Aluf in Gaza. President Biden has told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*04:06.460- 04:12.680* :  that the flow of aid into Gaza needs to be considerably increased. The U.S. leader and his
*04:12.680- 04:17.580* :  Egyptian counterpart Abdel-Fatta Al-Sisi have agreed to accelerate assistance for the territory.
*04:17.660- 04:23.640* :  24 trucks carrying relief supplies were allowed into Gaza from Egypt on Sunday,
*04:23.640- 04:30.580* :  but Cairo says hundreds more are being held up by Israeli checks. Meanwhile, the UN Relief
*04:30.580- 04:36.080* :  Agency for Palestinians, Unrah, is warning that civil order in Gaza is starting to collapse
*04:36.080- 04:42.000* :  after more than three weeks of Israeli bombardment, warehouses containing flower and other
*04:42.000- 04:48.100* :  basic supplies have been ransacked by thousands of people. These gardens said they were forced to
*04:48.100- 04:54.080* :  act because after weeks of Israel only allowing in a trickle of food and aid, they had nothing.
*04:56.860- 05:03.680* :  We have no flower, no aid, no water, not even toilets. Our houses were destroyed, no one cares about
*05:03.680- 05:09.540* :  us. We appeal to the people of the world. All international powers are against us. We needed aid,
*05:09.540- 05:15.460* :  and we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need. We need fresh water, we need food,
*05:15.460- 05:20.640* :  we are starving. This is totally unfair. Our children can't sleep from hunger and thirst,
*05:20.680- 05:25.600* :  we need to provide water and food for them. I heard more about this issue from our chief
*05:25.600- 05:31.740* :  international correspondent, Lee Jusset, who's in Jerusalem. Day in day out, for many weeks now,
*05:31.740- 05:39.200* :  we've heard the stories of people going to bakeries, skirmishes around the bread, the very limited
*05:39.200- 05:45.700* :  amount of bread there is, people eating one pita bread a day, people having to drive for a very
*05:45.700- 05:54.920* :  long time to find water or food. Only a trickle of aid is getting in. And so even the United Nations,
*05:54.920- 06:03.160* :  the UNRAF, the spokesperson, even the world food program spokesperson has said that it's understandable
*06:03.260- 06:09.560* :  that people will try to break into places that they think there is food there. They would think
*06:09.560- 06:16.680* :  there's food which belongs to us. This includes flour for making a bread. And so thousands of people
*06:16.680- 06:22.460* :  have apparently, according to the UN, gone into the distribution centers, gone into the warehouses,
*06:23.000- 06:28.680* :  trying to grab whatever they can. This is the actions of not just a desperate people,
*06:28.680- 06:35.120* :  but a starving people. Israel votes says there is enough food in Gaza and that it will allow more
*06:35.120- 06:42.780* :  food to go in. Yes, it was noticeable that on Friday night, when they announced the expansion of
*06:42.780- 06:49.300* :  their ground operations, in other words, at armor and soldiers, would cross the border and would
*06:49.300- 06:56.000* :  stay there for the first time, that they would also accelerate the entry of aid. And we have just
*06:56.000- 07:03.800* :  heard before I joined you that another 24 trucks did get in today. We heard this from the Egyptian
*07:03.800- 07:10.680* :  Red Crescent Society, it had food supplies and medical necessities. That brings the sum total
*07:10.680- 07:21.200* :  in a week of entries to 118. In times before the war, including commercial supplies coming into
*07:21.200- 07:28.760* :  Gaza, there were 500 trucks a day. Please do set. There were clashes in Gaza on Sunday
*07:28.760- 07:34.820* :  between Hamas fighters and Israeli troops near the areas crossing. The Israeli army says its forces
*07:34.820- 07:40.700* :  killed several Hamas government who'd come out of a tunnel. Hamas's armed wing said that it
*07:40.700- 07:46.040* :  had attacked Israeli armored vehicles. They're killing those inside. A spokesman for the Israeli
*07:46.040- 07:53.360* :  Defense Forces, Daniel Hagari, gave this update on the ground operation in Gaza. The ground
*07:53.360- 08:01.840* :  forces seen and air have been acting in Gaza today and eliminated. We're continuing
*08:04.060- 08:10.640* :  to assess a situation and expanding things gradually based on our plans in order to achieve
*08:10.640- 08:19.660* :  objectives of this war. We are calling upon the northern Gaza needs to evacuate temporarily
*08:20.140- 08:28.000* :  to the south for your own safety. Just below the Gaza River, the conditions will be so much better.
*08:28.000- 08:34.560* :  There is water, food and medication there. My colleague Julian Marshall spoke to another one of
*08:34.560- 08:40.360* :  our correspondence in Jerusalem, Paul Adams, about the repeated IDF warning for the residents of
*08:40.360- 08:49.260* :  Gaza to move south. This has become a daily refrain. The Israelis are determined that as many
*08:49.260- 08:54.640* :  Palestinians as possible should lead the northern third of the Gaza Strip and move south,
*08:55.400- 09:01.440* :  because it's clear that Gaza City and its surrounding areas will be the main focus of its
*09:01.440- 09:07.180* :  activity in the weeks to come, judging by the words that have come out from Israeli leaders and
*09:07.180- 09:13.340* :  the maneuvering so far of the Israeli military, their focus is very much on Gaza City and they are
*09:13.340- 09:18.620* :  acutely conscious that as long as there are tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of
*09:18.620- 09:25.400* :  people in that area, it is going to be a hellishly difficult job. The story around Al-Quds Hospital
*09:25.400- 09:30.520* :  tonight is an example of that already, because you have repeated warnings to the hospital
*09:30.520- 09:36.520* :  to leave. You have bombing nearby, which is actually breaking windows and causing panic
*09:36.520- 09:41.780* :  in the hospital, convincing many that the hospital may already be in some ways under attack,
*09:41.820- 09:47.900* :  but everyone knows that this is going to get more and more acute as this military offensive gets
*09:48.500- 09:54.160* :  deeper and deeper into Gaza. Has there been, in fact, any clarification as to whether the hospital
*09:54.160- 10:00.680* :  has been told to evacuate? Because I know at one point a red crescent official was saying that
*10:00.680- 10:05.780* :  that order had been rescinded. It's very, very unclear at all, and the Israelis have not said anything
*10:05.780- 10:11.560* :  about it that I'm aware of. I think it is all in the context of these, you know, this repeated
*10:11.560- 10:17.980* :  general appeal or demand to the people of Gaza to leave. And you know, it has been sounding
*10:17.980- 10:24.140* :  more and more urgent, because I think the Israelis are conscious that this is still a heavily
*10:24.140- 10:29.660* :  populated area, and that for one reason or another, either because people simply refuse to go,
*10:29.660- 10:34.380* :  or because in perhaps in some cases, Hamas is stopping them from leaving. The Israelis are going
*10:34.380- 10:40.300* :  to find themselves conducting complex military operations in a built-up area with a large civilian
*10:40.300- 10:45.080* :  population, and that is clearly a nightmare. And very briefly, Paul, can you give us any sense
*10:45.080- 10:53.240* :  of how this ground defensive, this ground war is shaping up? Are they slicing up
*10:53.240- 10:59.020* :  guards and territory and cleaning it up? It's a bit early to say that. I mean, they really only
*10:59.020- 11:03.700* :  on the ground up in one tiny little corner of the northwest of the Gaza Strip.
*11:03.960- 11:07.560* :  They seem to have established a bit of a foothold there over the last 48 hours,
*11:07.860- 11:12.420* :  and we're not seeing much sign of that expanding just yet. But I think there is every indication
*11:12.440- 11:18.000* :  that this is going to be a slow-burning campaign in which the Israelis are going to gradually
*11:18.000- 11:25.800* :  expand their presence on the ground and try and squeeze Gaza City in particular to the point where,
*11:25.800- 11:32.020* :  you know, the civilians leave and the Hamas fighters there give up. But, you know, that is a long way
*11:32.020- 11:40.060* :  off. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, has met some of the relatives of the
*11:40.060- 11:45.660* :  more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. A day after the families got the chance to
*11:45.660- 11:50.800* :  talk directly to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They told him they feared the
*11:50.800- 11:57.100* :  intensified air strikes on Gaza and Israel's expanded ground operation were further endangering
*11:57.100- 12:02.520* :  the lives of their loved ones. Among the hostages are the sister-in-law and 12-year-old niece of
*12:02.520- 12:11.080* :  Zoha Avigduri, a teacher in Haifa. Now all of our hopes are in the hands of public subpoena in
*12:11.080- 12:17.720* :  Israel, in the world, in the hands of media diplomats to get everyone to realize that no matter
*12:17.720- 12:24.440* :  how harsh the conflict is, these people are innocent civilians. There are babies and children
*12:24.440- 12:30.800* :  and women and elderly people there and we need to get them back. There's been a phenomenal
*12:30.800- 12:37.260* :  coming together of all the families of the hostages and kidnapped people and a strong
*12:37.780- 12:43.240* :  demand from the government and from foreign governments, from foreign organizations,
*12:43.340- 12:50.380* :  from the Red Cross and the demand is to bring them home right now. This is a violation of all
*12:50.980- 12:58.460* :  the war laws. This is a violation of human decency, of human morality and our call is to our
*12:58.460- 13:04.440* :  government as to the rest of the world to bring them as quickly as possible. We expect that as
*13:04.440- 13:10.400* :  the time goes by, the chance of seeing them back alive and well decreases more and more and
*13:10.400- 13:17.420* :  it's crucial to act now. Zoha Avigduri, a teacher whose relatives are being held hostage by Hamas.
*13:18.200- 13:23.800* :  Israel has urged Russia to protect Jews after a mob in the Republic of Dagestan
*13:23.800- 13:29.300* :  stormed an airport where a flight had reportedly landed from Tel Aviv. From Moscow,
*13:29.300- 13:34.760* :  here's our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. Mobile phone video from the scene showed an angry
*13:34.760- 13:40.780* :  crowd what looks like hundreds of people storming the airport in Mahachkala, the regional capital
*13:40.780- 13:46.140* :  of the mainly Muslim-Russian Republic of Dagestan. They ran through the terminal building,
*13:46.140- 13:53.480* :  looking for Israelis. They shouted in Arabic God is greatest and antisemitic slogans. Others
*13:53.480- 14:00.320* :  outside Mahachkala Airport were stopping cars and demanding to see documents in a chaotic search
*14:00.320- 14:06.500* :  for Israeli passports. Russian National Guard have now arrived on the scene. A criminal case has
*14:06.500- 14:12.980* :  been opened for civil disorder. Steve Rosenberg, now let's turn to a rather interesting side effect
*14:12.980- 14:18.800* :  of climate change. Global warming is causing Norway's glaciers to melt and as they disappear,
*14:19.400- 14:24.700* :  ancient artifacts that were once lost in the ice are now reemerging, having been buried for
*14:24.700- 14:31.100* :  thousands of years. But the retreating glaciers also pose a risk to these newly uncovered treasures
*14:31.560- 14:37.440* :  and teams of archaeologists are racing to collect them before they decompose and are lost forever
*14:37.440- 14:44.820* :  as Aegean Mary reports. It's a steep three-hour hike over rugged and rocky terrain to our
*14:44.820- 14:51.060* :  base camp at the foot of the Lemberin ice patch. I'm with a team of glacial archaeologists
*14:51.900- 14:58.080* :  searching for artifacts as they merge from the rapidly melting ice. Behind me is the last remains
*14:58.080- 15:04.040* :  of the ice leading up to the lost mountain pass. Julian Post Melbu is an archaeologist at the
*15:04.040- 15:09.580* :  museum of cultural history at the University of Oslo. We can already see that the ice has
*15:09.580- 15:14.920* :  receded a lot since last time we did field work here. At almost 2,000 meters high,
*15:14.920- 15:19.840* :  it's believed this pass was once a transport route from Norway's interior to the coast.
*15:19.840- 15:25.460* :  Espen Finstad is a glacial archaeologist working for Norway's inland at Canter.
*15:25.960- 15:33.740* :  We know that there have been a route here at least from 280, but after that this route was forgotten.
*15:34.200- 15:41.180* :  Norway find different items from up to 6000 years ago. They tell us a whole new story about the
*15:41.180- 15:47.520* :  importance of the mountains in the past. Walking in lines the team meticulously surveyed the rocky
*15:47.520- 15:58.500* :  grand alongside the ice. Suddenly they're in luck. This here is the bit for a horse and it also
*15:58.500- 16:05.240* :  has a part of the bridal preserve which is exceedingly rare. This should be like thousand years old,
*16:06.060- 16:10.760* :  maybe more. Frozen for thousands of years the finds are remarkably well preserved,
*16:11.400- 16:14.940* :  but it's race against time to rescue them before they decay.
*16:15.560- 16:19.720* :  We have a small window of opportunity to save these for the future generations.
*16:19.720- 16:24.780* :  As they were lost on the ice these objects they just ended up what is pretty much a giant
*16:24.780- 16:29.640* :  prehistoric freezer. They get frozen, there is nothing there for them to decompose and they come out
*16:30.300- 16:37.280* :  mint condition. At museum labs in Oslo the finds are analysed and carbon dated.
*16:37.940- 16:41.240* :  Glacial archaeology has emerged as a new field in recent decades.
*16:42.140- 16:46.060* :  Lars Pilo is one of the lead researchers from the secrets of the ice team.
*16:46.360- 16:51.940* :  The ice is retreating and that has released thousands of artifacts so we now have more than
*16:51.940- 16:58.920* :  4000 finds and the 66 sites. Among them are viking swords, snow shoes for horses,
*16:59.500- 17:03.600* :  an ancient pair of wooden skis and even Roman style sandals.
*17:04.460- 17:08.580* :  As the ice thaws are once unknown chapter of history has now opened up.
*17:09.120- 17:12.120* :  Within the coming decades these ice patches may be gone.
*17:12.680- 17:18.240* :  These snow patches they are slowly dying and it has to do with climate change, warmer climate,
*17:18.280- 17:25.980* :  more rain humid. The snow ice is melting rapidly so it's a huge change.
*17:26.580- 17:28.700* :  That leaves us been fintzen with mixed feelings.
*17:29.260- 17:35.860* :  Mostly when I go around I feel a little bit sad knowing how it will even be in 50 years
*17:36.840- 17:42.720* :  but I also can be very excited when we find things, saving things.
*17:44.300- 17:50.040* :  Espen finds that a glacial archaeologist ending that report from Adrian Murray in Norway.
*17:52.880- 18:00.320* :  Still to come. There is a lot of birds and I can see a lot of green, a lot of trees
*18:00.540- 18:06.460* :  on the other side of the river. The arduous task facing Ecuador's new president
*18:06.980- 18:09.980* :  shutting down an oil field in the Amazon rainforest.
*18:16.540- 18:22.500* :  The explanation is the podcast from the BBC World Service that goes beyond the spin,
*18:22.500- 18:29.060* :  exploring the important questions about long-running stories and the latest global news.
*18:29.100- 18:37.180* :  An honest explanation of the events shaping our lives. Search for the explanation wherever you get
*18:37.180- 18:44.880* :  your BBC podcast. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Reports from Iran say several people
*18:44.880- 18:49.600* :  were arrested at the funeral of a teenager who'd been in a coma for weeks after an alleged
*18:49.600- 18:54.380* :  confrontation with the morality police. There was tight security at the funeral on Sunday of
*18:54.380- 18:59.860* :  Armita Garavan, who was declared brain dead last week. Human rights groups have blamed the
*18:59.860- 19:04.620* :  police for her death, saying they assaulted her for not covering her hair when she got on a train
*19:04.620- 19:10.840* :  in Tehran. This year's Nobel Peace Laureate, Nagez Mohammadi, was one of many Iranians who also
*19:10.840- 19:16.600* :  blamed the authorities. They deny any wrongdoing. I heard more about the funeral from Khazran Najee
*19:16.600- 19:23.300* :  of BBC Persian. Surprising thing about this is that normally in these circumstances when there's
*19:23.300- 19:29.380* :  a lot of secrecy and security forces are getting out of hand, they prevent these things happening.
*19:29.380- 19:35.800* :  But for some reason it went ahead, hundreds of people turned up, and then the funeral
*19:36.220- 19:42.820* :  sort of slowly morphed into some kind of protest, shouting slogans against the government,
*19:42.820- 19:48.380* :  various people, and several people from what we understand have been arrested, including
*19:49.000- 19:53.780* :  Nazrin. Nazrin so today is a well-known human rights activist in Iran,
*19:54.220- 20:00.720* :  jailed for many years. She was out of prison on furlough, but it looks as if she's been picked up
*20:00.720- 20:05.620* :  again. Not surprising that these protests have happened because many people in Iran and
*20:05.620- 20:11.240* :  outside Iran have been drawing parallels between the death of Armita Garavan and that of
*20:11.240- 20:16.120* :  Masa Amini over a year ago that sparked those widespread protests across Iran.
*20:16.480- 20:24.100* :  That's right, and everyone you talk to, they believed that Armita was killed basically pushed
*20:24.100- 20:31.360* :  out of the train by hijab guards inside the train. The government denies this, of course. They
*20:31.360- 20:38.900* :  say that when she entered the train, her blood pressure dropped suddenly and she fell and she
*20:38.900- 20:45.480* :  had her head against the platform just outside the train, but everyone believes that she was pushed.
*20:45.740- 20:50.100* :  In terms of international reaction, we've heard expressions of outrage in the past, but the
*20:50.100- 20:56.060* :  Iranian authorities may perhaps be banking on the fact that the world is focused on events elsewhere
*20:56.460- 21:02.080* :  in the Middle East right now in Gaza. Absolutely, I think that's the reason that they announced
*21:02.140- 21:11.480* :  her death at this time because we got reports that she was basically brain dead and they were
*21:11.480- 21:18.640* :  keeping her going just so that they keep her just about alive or at least they can say that
*21:18.640- 21:25.000* :  she's not dead. And then they announced her death right at the height of the stuff that is going
*21:25.000- 21:32.300* :  on in Gaza and all the attention in Iran as well as outside Iran. So they've diverted to the war
*21:32.300- 21:39.420* :  in Gaza. It was the best time for them, the authorities to release the news so that the reactions
*21:39.980- 21:44.340* :  inside the country wouldn't be as much as it would have been otherwise.
*21:45.220- 21:51.500* :  Kazranaji, Kenya's Human Rights Commission has said King Charles should apologize for abuses
*21:51.500- 21:56.940* :  committed by Britain during the colonial era. The monarch is making a state visit to Kenya on
*21:56.940- 22:03.000* :  Tuesday and says he will try to learn more about the wrongs that people suffered there. Paul Moss
*22:03.000- 22:08.760* :  reports. This is a trip that matters. The US, Russia and China are all jostling for
*22:08.760- 22:14.160* :  influence in Africa. But Kenya is one country where the UK thinks it can still play a role.
*22:14.600- 22:19.560* :  That's perhaps why the British government is keen to appease local feeling, promising that
*22:19.560- 22:25.060* :  King Charles will try to deepen his understanding of the colonial era during his visit this week.
*22:25.760- 22:31.820* :  But that era saw about 10,000 Kenyans killed when the British authorities suppressed a pro-independence
*22:31.820- 22:36.800* :  movement. The country's Human Rights Commission now wants an apology but there's been no indication
*22:36.800- 22:42.120* :  that any will be offered. Paul Moss, the authorities in the Mexican City of Acapulco,
*22:42.120- 22:47.500* :  which was devastated by a hurricane, say it will take at least three months to clear all the debris
*22:47.500- 22:53.060* :  near the port and the marina. 43 people are now known to have died. Here's our America's
*22:53.060- 22:58.300* :  regional editor, Leonardo Russia. Many of the victims were fishermen who were at sea or who
*22:58.300- 23:03.280* :  stayed in their boats for fear of robberies during the storm. Otis made landfall in the early
*23:03.280- 23:09.260* :  hours of Wednesday taking forecasters by surprise. They had predicted a mild tropical storm and
*23:09.260- 23:15.340* :  only realized they had become a powerful hurricane a few hours before it hit Acapulco. Otis became
*23:15.340- 23:22.600* :  the strongest hurricane ever on Mexico's Pacific coast. The local government estimates that 220,000
*23:22.600- 23:27.580* :  buildings have been damaged. Thousands of soldiers and heavily armed police have been deployed
*23:27.580- 23:34.900* :  across the city to try to prevent looting. Leonardo Russia, how do you balance an economy that
*23:34.900- 23:40.640* :  relies on oil but voted to close one of its largest oil fields? That's the question facing the
*23:40.640- 23:46.380* :  newly elected interim president of Ecuador. Daniel Neboa takes office next month and along with
*23:46.380- 23:52.100* :  trying to control violent crime and revive an ailing economy, he's also tasked with shutting down
*23:52.100- 23:57.700* :  an oil field in Ecuador's Amazon rainforest. Sophie Eastor from the BBC World Services,
*23:57.700- 24:06.000* :  the climate question, reports. There's a lot of birds and I can see a lot of green, a lot of trees
*24:06.220- 24:13.060* :  on the other side of the river. This is Lissette Aravolo. She's a journalist based in Ecuador.
*24:13.680- 24:18.880* :  She's not far from the Yasuni National Park, a protected part of the rainforest that's one of
*24:18.880- 24:27.160* :  the most biodiverse places on earth. It contains around 1,300 species of animals or more
*24:27.560- 24:37.660* :  and more than 2,700 species of plants. You can find tapites, wonders, jaguars, so many birds that
*24:37.660- 24:43.900* :  I don't know all of the names. This extraordinary national park is also home to several indigenous
*24:43.900- 24:52.000* :  communities, including two uncontacted tribes, but it's also a large source of Ecuador's oil.
*24:52.000- 25:01.620* :  It produces nearly 60,000 barrels a day. On August 20th we voted for a referendum to decide whether
*25:01.620- 25:10.080* :  the oil in Yasuni should stay in the ground. Around 60% of Ecuadorians voted to stop the oil drilling.
*25:10.520- 25:16.920* :  People are worried about climate change. People are worried that the biodiversity will be affected by
*25:16.920- 25:24.120* :  more oil drilling. People are worried about contamination and the help of the people who live close
*25:24.120- 25:32.380* :  to the national park and the oil fields. The Ecuadorian vote was the world's first national
*25:32.380- 25:38.900* :  referendum on whether to stop oil extraction. Alejandra Santillana is one of the activists who
*25:38.900- 25:46.460* :  campaigned for it. We were like, no way. We were fighting for this like 10 years, you know,
*25:46.460- 25:54.840* :  what is for us was so important. Were you surprised that 60% of Ecuadorians voted to stop drilling
*25:54.840- 26:00.560* :  this oil? Yeah, yeah, we were very surprised. We have been extracting oil for the last
*26:01.340- 26:06.140* :  50 years and all has occupied a central place in the national budget.
*26:06.720- 26:12.240* :  But the result hasn't gone down well with everyone, especially people living in the area who
*26:12.240- 26:19.260* :  depend on oil for their income. Juan Vargas runs boat tours down the Napo River near the Yasuni
*26:19.260- 26:30.320* :  national park. I voted that we should drill for oil, get it all out of the ground and 1000%
*26:30.380- 26:37.100* :  sure we should. Oil is the only resource our country has. If we don't drill it, how are we going
*26:37.100- 26:43.320* :  to make a living? The referendum took place alongside a general election where the Ecuadorian people
*26:43.320- 26:50.220* :  also voted for a changing government. The outgoing administration has raised huge concerns about
*26:50.220- 26:58.720* :  stopping oil drilling in Yasuni. We are the poor country and we cannot afford to stop production
*26:58.720- 27:05.120* :  in such an important field. This is Fernando Santos, Ecuador's current energy and mining minister.
*27:05.560- 27:17.160* :  This field produces around 12% of our oil production. It is 1.2 of GDP and on top of that,
*27:18.180- 27:29.640* :  around 1 billion dollars will be the cause of dismantling the infrastructure so it will be a terrible
*27:29.640- 27:36.260* :  blow for the country for the economy. Newly elected president Daniel Naboer reportedly voted in
*27:36.260- 27:42.500* :  favor of stopping the drilling and is now faced with the complex task of closing the oil field
*27:43.000- 27:50.100* :  while also delivering on his promise to revive Ecuador's economy. That report by Sophie
*27:50.100- 27:56.400* :  Easter. Tributes have poured in for the actor Matthew Perry, best known for starring in the
*27:56.400- 28:02.380* :  TV sitcom Friends after his death at the age of 54. He was found dead at his home in Los Angeles
*28:02.380- 28:07.900* :  on Saturday. His family released a statement expressing appreciation for the outpouring of love,
*28:08.340- 28:13.860* :  saying he'd brought so much joy to the world, both as an actor and a friend. The Canadian
*28:13.860- 28:18.580* :  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who went to school with him, said his passing was shocking
*28:18.580- 28:24.180* :  and saddening and thanked him for all the laughs. With a look back at Matthew Perry's life,
*28:24.440- 28:25.400* :  here's Charlotte Gallica.
*28:31.980- 28:37.880* :  As the sarcastic, witty and wisecracking Chandler Bing, Matthew Perry was one of the most
*28:37.880- 28:40.800* :  successful television stars of his generation.
*28:49.020- 28:52.180* :  He didn't just play the character, he was the character.
*28:52.740- 28:57.560* :  Perry said that when he first read the script for Friends, it was like someone had followed
*28:57.560- 29:04.360* :  him around for a year, stealing his jokes, copying his mannerisms and photocopying his world
*29:04.360- 29:10.680* :  weary yet witty view of life. But at the height of his fame, the actor was struggling with addiction
*29:10.680- 29:17.900* :  to alcohol and drugs. He spent more than 5 million pounds getting sober and attended more than
*29:17.900- 29:25.040* :  6,000 alcoholics anonymous meetings. Perry spoke openly about his addiction and the impact it
*29:25.040- 29:25.960* :  had on his life.
*29:26.120- 29:32.800* :  It became a very public issue, which in hindsight it was quite good. I'm happy that it was because
*29:32.800- 29:37.800* :  it ultimately helped me in the long run. Because I had to go through the struggles publicly,
*29:37.800- 29:40.480* :  I get to help a lot more people.
*29:40.480- 29:46.040* :  Matthew Perry received Emmy nominations for his portrayal of Chandler Bing and his work on the
*29:46.040- 29:51.000* :  West Wing. He also appeared in films such as The Whole Nine Yards and Fools Russian.
*29:51.760- 29:55.160* :  But it's his role in Friends that he will be best remembered for.
*29:55.660- 29:59.700* :  Perry made millions laugh with his one-liners and comic timing.
*30:00.460- 30:04.400* :  Maggie Wheeler, who played his brash on-screen girlfriend, Janice said,
*30:05.080- 30:06.820* :  the world will miss you, Matthew Perry.
*30:07.700- 30:13.220* :  Charlotte Gallagher, looking back on the life of the actor, Matthew Perry, who has died at the age of 54.
*30:15.900- 30:20.460* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the Global News Podcast later.
