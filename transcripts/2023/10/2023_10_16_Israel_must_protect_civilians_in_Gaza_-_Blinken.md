*01:41.720- 01:44.120* :  I'm Robin Brant and in the early hours of Monday,
*01:44.120- 01:46.680* :  the 16th of October, these are our main stories.
*01:47.260- 01:50.900* :  The US Secretary of State has urged Israel to do everything possible
*01:50.900- 01:52.400* :  to avoid harming civilians
*01:52.460- 01:55.940* :  as it prepares for a major ground offensive into Gaza.
*01:56.540- 01:59.340* :  The Israeli government says it's restoring water supplies
*01:59.340- 02:00.420* :  to southern Gaza,
*02:00.420- 02:03.200* :  although there's no electricity for pumping stations.
*02:03.880- 02:06.040* :  In other news, as we record this podcast,
*02:06.040- 02:09.620* :  the votes are being counted following Poland's general election
*02:10.120- 02:12.600* :  with exit polls suggesting the right-wing law
*02:12.600- 02:15.020* :  and justice party may be forced from power.
*02:17.940- 02:19.100* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:20.880- 02:22.240* :  If I can do that scale, I know I can do it,
*02:22.240- 02:22.860* :  and then I'll start with that.
*02:22.860- 02:24.700* :  Oh boy, hi, a pal, it's me, Mickey Mouse.
*02:24.860- 02:25.680* :  I'm Brett Iwan.
*02:25.720- 02:27.320* :  I am the official voice of Mickey Mouse,
*02:27.320- 02:30.020* :  and I've had that distinguishing pleasure since 2009.
*02:30.560- 02:32.280* :  A major exhibition opens in London,
*02:32.280- 02:35.880* :  celebrating the centenary of the Walt Disney Animation Studios.
*02:36.400- 02:37.780* :  It will then tour around the world.
*02:41.940- 02:44.800* :  We start with the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken,
*02:44.800- 02:47.660* :  who has warned that every precaution must be taken
*02:48.040- 02:50.180* :  to avoid harming civilians as Israel
*02:50.180- 02:52.460* :  prepares a major ground offensive in Gaza.
*02:53.020- 02:56.640* :  More than 2,600 Palestinians have now been killed
*02:56.640- 02:58.600* :  by Israeli attacks on Gaza
*02:58.620- 03:02.180* :  since the Hamas assault on Israel just over a week ago.
*03:02.640- 03:04.800* :  Then 1,400 Israelis were killed.
*03:05.400- 03:07.380* :  Mr Blinken added that Hamas' vision
*03:07.380- 03:08.800* :  for the future of the Middle East
*03:08.800- 03:11.680* :  was one of death, destruction, and terrorism.
*03:12.340- 03:14.080* :  He's been holding talks in Cairo
*03:14.080- 03:16.780* :  with the Egyptian President Abdel Fata LCC
*03:17.300- 03:18.960* :  before leaving Egypt by plane,
*03:18.960- 03:21.240* :  the US Secretary of State spoke to reporters
*03:21.240- 03:24.180* :  and stressed that Israel should do everything possible
*03:24.180- 03:25.820* :  to avoid civilian casualties.
*03:26.420- 03:27.920* :  Israel has the right.
*03:28.800- 03:30.780* :  Indeed, it has the obligation to defend itself
*03:30.780- 03:32.600* :  against these attacks from Hamas
*03:33.280- 03:35.220* :  and to try to do what it can to make sure
*03:35.220- 03:36.860* :  that this never happens again.
*03:38.240- 03:39.380* :  As I said in Tel Aviv,
*03:39.840- 03:40.980* :  as President Biden has said,
*03:41.500- 03:43.420* :  the way that Israel does this matters
*03:44.520- 03:46.980* :  needs to do it in a way that affirms
*03:47.260- 03:50.460* :  the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity.
*03:50.900- 03:52.480* :  Well, this was what Egypt's president
*03:52.480- 03:54.440* :  had to say after the two men met.
*03:55.120- 03:58.920* :  The current crisis is a drastic one,
*03:59.340- 04:01.360* :  and I believe that the ongoing retaliation
*04:01.700- 04:04.160* :  goes beyond the right to self-defense for Israel
*04:04.700- 04:06.300* :  and amounts to the collective punishment
*04:06.300- 04:07.420* :  of the Gaza Strip,
*04:07.440- 04:10.000* :  home to 2.3 million Palestinians.
*04:11.860- 04:14.360* :  Another topic on the talks in Egypt
*04:14.360- 04:16.840* :  were the efforts to open the Raffa crossing.
*04:16.840- 04:19.220* :  That's the border crossing in the south of Gaza,
*04:19.220- 04:21.040* :  which is controlled by Egypt.
*04:21.620- 04:24.840* :  So what's the current situation regarding that border crossing?
*04:24.840- 04:27.580* :  I spoke to our diplomatic correspondent, Caroline Hawley.
*04:28.260- 04:29.140* :  It's hard to know.
*04:29.140- 04:31.060* :  I think what we know is that Egypt
*04:31.500- 04:34.280* :  wants the crossing open to get aid in
*04:34.280- 04:36.940* :  because there is aid basically just backing up now
*04:36.940- 04:38.040* :  in the Sinai Peninsula.
*04:38.680- 04:41.320* :  What Egypt doesn't want is a mass influx
*04:41.320- 04:42.640* :  of Palestinian refugees,
*04:42.640- 04:45.020* :  but I think they are ready to allow foreigners.
*04:45.480- 04:48.420* :  The US and the UK are saying they're working to get it open
*04:48.420- 04:53.080* :  because it is the only viable route in and out of Gaza
*04:53.080- 04:56.160* :  and concern, as you just heard from President Ceci
*04:56.160- 04:59.380* :  about the humanitarian situation is mounting.
*04:59.380- 05:01.420* :  Anthony Blinken, the Secretary of State,
*05:01.420- 05:03.700* :  has been hearing in pretty much every hour of capital
*05:03.700- 05:06.220* :  is alarm at what Israel's doing.
*05:06.540- 05:08.900* :  And on Iran's possible involvement,
*05:08.900- 05:10.780* :  I'm just looking at the Royal State Agency here
*05:10.780- 05:12.760* :  and we're hearing a warning from Iran's foreign minister
*05:13.240- 05:15.540* :  saying that the US will suffer significant damage
*05:15.540- 05:19.120* :  if the Gaza war spirals into a bigger conflict.
*05:19.120- 05:22.200* :  What about this issue of Iran's possible involvement
*05:22.200- 05:23.400* :  of possible escalation?
*05:23.400- 05:26.460* :  How much of a focus has that been for Anthony Blinken today
*05:26.460- 05:28.200* :  and others in the Biden administration?
*05:28.580- 05:29.520* :  Look, it's a massive fear.
*05:29.560- 05:32.260* :  It's the reason why they've sent a second aircraft carrier
*05:32.260- 05:32.820* :  to the region.
*05:32.880- 05:35.980* :  The big fear is what we've seen is skirmishes
*05:35.980- 05:38.200* :  along the border between Israel and Lebanon.
*05:38.700- 05:42.640* :  And in Lebanon is the Shia militant group, Hisbullah,
*05:42.640- 05:44.000* :  which is a proxy of Iran.
*05:44.500- 05:46.540* :  And everyone is trying to make sure that Hisbullah
*05:46.540- 05:50.500* :  doesn't open up a second front that would really make
*05:50.500- 05:52.660* :  this war spill over into other countries.
*05:52.660- 05:56.740* :  So what we heard from the Iranian foreign minister,
*05:56.740- 06:00.080* :  Hussein Amir Abdallahian, was these were his words.
*06:00.400- 06:02.600* :  If the Zionist aggressions do not stop,
*06:02.600- 06:05.920* :  the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger.
*06:06.300- 06:07.680* :  Well, that's very clear that they're on the trigger
*06:08.240- 06:11.440* :  because of those skirmishes we're seeing in southern Lebanon
*06:11.440- 06:12.620* :  and northern Israel.
*06:12.940- 06:15.800* :  And just quickly, Tony Blinken, I think extending the trip
*06:15.800- 06:18.660* :  and back in Israel, presumably for more talks,
*06:18.660- 06:20.440* :  maybe with Bibi Netanyahu as well.
*06:20.580- 06:23.220* :  Again, I think the wrap-acrossing is key just
*06:23.220- 06:27.480* :  because of how concerned all Arab countries are.
*06:27.480- 06:29.420* :  He is hearing warning after warning
*06:29.420- 06:32.120* :  of the warning about the risk of this spreading
*06:32.640- 06:35.860* :  if the plight of Palestinians isn't taken into consideration
*06:35.860- 06:37.220* :  as Israel responds.
*06:37.700- 06:38.840* :  Caroline Hawley reporting.
*06:39.380- 06:41.880* :  Well, Jordan is another country that's always felt
*06:41.880- 06:44.760* :  the pressures of the Middle East conflict very directly
*06:44.760- 06:49.320* :  as well as the history of the wars in 1948 and 1967.
*06:49.820- 06:53.740* :  Jordan is now home to over 2.5 million Palestinian refugees.
*06:54.560- 06:56.480* :  King Abdullah is currently in London
*06:56.480- 06:58.080* :  at the start of a European tour.
*06:58.500- 07:01.320* :  And on Sunday, he met the British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
*07:01.780- 07:05.360* :  Recently, he has issued a statement saying that the UK stands
*07:05.360- 07:07.840* :  with Israel on its right to defend itself.
*07:08.380- 07:11.140* :  His statement, though, did not mention the situation in Gaza.
*07:11.640- 07:13.860* :  Traveling with the Jordanian delegation to London
*07:13.860- 07:16.580* :  is King Abdullah's foreign minister, Aymen Safadi.
*07:17.060- 07:20.260* :  O'impenet Jones asked him if Jordan was satisfied
*07:20.260- 07:22.180* :  with the British position on Gaza.
*07:22.860- 07:25.060* :  What we all need to do is to stand
*07:25.760- 07:27.280* :  with the right of all people still living
*07:27.280- 07:28.880* :  peace and dignity and security.
*07:29.460- 07:31.500* :  What we all need to do is to work together
*07:31.500- 07:34.220* :  to stop this madness that is engulfing the whole region
*07:34.220- 07:38.760* :  and stop this catastrophic human loss of life.
*07:39.320- 07:42.860* :  And to what we all need to do is to prevent this terrible war
*07:42.860- 07:44.520* :  from engulfing the whole region.
*07:44.660- 07:47.400* :  Well, I totally understand you're arguing for de-escalation
*07:48.360- 07:50.360* :  and to get back to stability.
*07:50.940- 07:52.920* :  What I'm trying to get at is, you know,
*07:52.920- 07:54.560* :  your Jordan in the middle of this.
*07:55.140- 07:57.920* :  Are you thinking that the Western government's positions
*07:58.340- 07:59.300* :  are helping you do that?
*07:59.700- 08:00.820* :  Or are they too one-sided?
*08:01.240- 08:03.800* :  I think emotions have been high.
*08:03.800- 08:06.920* :  The trauma of what happened is understandably difficult,
*08:06.920- 08:12.380* :  but I think it is our job to think of the enormous cause
*08:12.520- 08:14.060* :  this is bringing to the whole region
*08:14.060- 08:15.660* :  and could even get worse.
*08:16.180- 08:18.320* :  I think when it comes to our morality,
*08:18.320- 08:21.540* :  it should be one Palestinians and Israeli civilians
*08:21.740- 08:22.360* :  are civilians.
*08:23.180- 08:24.260* :  They need to be protected.
*08:24.260- 08:27.800* :  And I think we in the Arab world in Jordan came out
*08:27.800- 08:30.400* :  very clearly in condemning the killing of civilians
*08:30.400- 08:31.240* :  from both sides.
*08:31.980- 08:35.740* :  Our shared human values, our ability to move forward requires
*08:35.740- 08:38.060* :  that the whole world comes out very clear
*08:38.060- 08:40.240* :  in condemning the killing of both Palestinian
*08:40.240- 08:41.300* :  and Israeli civilians.
*08:41.300- 08:44.740* :  And unfortunately, we haven't seen that yet.
*08:44.740- 08:49.460* :  Why is it our crime to deny food and medicine
*08:49.460- 08:51.920* :  and water to Ukraine?
*08:52.720- 08:55.020* :  But it is not the same when it comes to Gaza.
*08:55.300- 08:58.560* :  I think we need to make sure that we are all
*08:58.880- 09:00.240* :  on the high moral ground here.
*09:00.380- 09:01.380* :  I think it is widely accepted.
*09:01.380- 09:04.160* :  A ground force is going to move into Gaza.
*09:04.760- 09:07.740* :  And one way to protect civilians would be to let them out
*09:08.400- 09:09.180* :  into Egypt.
*09:10.140- 09:11.260* :  Would you think that's a good idea?
*09:11.680- 09:12.360* :  That's a no.
*09:12.900- 09:14.820* :  In the most affirmative way,
*09:15.460- 09:19.640* :  memories of the 1948 and 1967 are still pretty much there
*09:19.640- 09:20.200* :  in the region.
*09:20.780- 09:22.720* :  Population displacement, population transfer
*09:22.720- 09:23.940* :  will not hold the problem.
*09:24.420- 09:26.560* :  What needs to be done is to stop the war
*09:26.560- 09:29.420* :  and to make sure that Gazans are safe in Gaza.
*09:30.060- 09:33.500* :  And trying to transfer the crisis, I'm sorry,
*09:33.500- 09:35.360* :  but we have to be honest to each other here
*09:35.360- 09:38.140* :  to transfer the crisis that the absence of hope
*09:38.160- 09:39.500* :  and the consideration of the occupation
*09:39.500- 09:42.800* :  has created to other countries in the region is an absolute no.
*09:42.840- 09:43.440* :  What do you say that?
*09:43.440- 09:44.840* :  But I think from Israel's point of view,
*09:44.840- 09:48.240* :  they would feel a lot safer if those people were moved.
*09:48.680- 09:52.040* :  And the whole region would feel less safe if this war continues
*09:52.040- 09:55.340* :  and if we do not create a path to a peace for both
*09:55.340- 09:56.720* :  Israelis and Palestinians.
*09:56.720- 10:01.220* :  You have 2.6 million Palestinian refugees in your country.
*10:01.940- 10:03.260* :  How many of them support Hamas?
*10:03.580- 10:07.680* :  Look, we've got to understand Hamas is not just an organization.
*10:07.680- 10:13.220* :  Hamas is also an idea that came to acquire more acceptance
*10:13.900- 10:16.160* :  as a result of the failure of the peace process
*10:16.160- 10:18.600* :  to deliver the peace that Oslo and all the agreements
*10:18.600- 10:20.180* :  that came after it promised.
*10:20.800- 10:24.500* :  Our job has been for long now is to try and create acceptance
*10:24.500- 10:26.620* :  for a different narrative that negotiations
*10:27.380- 10:28.580* :  is the best way to go forward.
*10:28.580- 10:30.180* :  That violence will only be good violence
*10:30.180- 10:31.680* :  and war will only be good to war.
*10:32.040- 10:35.660* :  But our collective failure to do so has pushed people
*10:35.660- 10:39.240* :  into the abyss of despair and we see that manifesting itself
*10:39.240- 10:40.840* :  in the way that you see.
*10:41.800- 10:44.720* :  Well, that was the Jordanian foreign minister, Iman Safadi.
*10:45.020- 10:46.820* :  As the conflict in Gaza continues,
*10:46.820- 10:49.240* :  there was on Sunday one positive development.
*10:49.840- 10:52.060* :  The water supply to southern Gaza is back on.
*10:52.560- 10:55.240* :  U.S. officials and then the Israeli government confirmed
*10:55.240- 10:57.700* :  that the pipeline's supply and water to the area
*10:57.700- 10:58.760* :  has been reopened.
*10:59.340- 11:01.280* :  In the past week, since the conflict began,
*11:01.280- 11:03.540* :  over 1 million people have been displaced,
*11:03.540- 11:05.920* :  following Israel's order to the Palestinians
*11:06.540- 11:08.520* :  to evacuate the north of the territory.
*11:09.100- 11:11.840* :  Israeli troops have continued to mass near Gaza
*11:11.840- 11:13.800* :  ahead of an expected ground offensive,
*11:14.200- 11:16.380* :  but it's not clear when that offensive will happen
*11:16.380- 11:18.780* :  and what form exactly it will take.
*11:19.360- 11:20.700* :  I heard more on Sunday evening
*11:20.700- 11:22.920* :  from our Middle East correspondent, Tom Bayman,
*11:22.920- 11:23.680* :  who's in Jerusalem.
*11:24.440- 11:27.060* :  The briefing from the Israeli military this morning
*11:27.060- 11:32.100* :  was that the timing will be a political decision.
*11:32.580- 11:35.280* :  That suggests to me that they are ready
*11:35.280- 11:37.900* :  from a military perspective and that seemed to be
*11:37.900- 11:40.500* :  where their statement from last night was heading.
*11:40.960- 11:43.160* :  So really what they're saying is now down
*11:43.160- 11:44.920* :  to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*11:44.920- 11:49.760* :  and his new emergency war cabinet to make that decision.
*11:50.140- 11:53.520* :  I think there'll be obviously a very large number
*11:53.520- 11:55.800* :  of considerations and one of those
*11:55.800- 11:58.160* :  is about the huge sort of operation of logistics
*11:58.160- 12:00.340* :  to keep supplying a front line
*12:00.460- 12:03.920* :  because the big risk of a military offensive
*12:03.920- 12:05.860* :  like this as far as the Israelis are concerned
*12:05.960- 12:09.900* :  is about getting bogged down in a very, very densely packed
*12:10.040- 12:12.420* :  urban environment because clearly they're going to be
*12:12.940- 12:15.640* :  aiming towards Gaza City as one of the places
*12:15.640- 12:17.000* :  in this ground invasion.
*12:17.780- 12:20.680* :  That is territory that Hamas knows very well
*12:21.060- 12:25.060* :  and as the invasion force, the supply to Israeli troops
*12:25.060- 12:28.100* :  will be one of the key considerations to them.
*12:28.780- 12:31.000* :  But the answer to your question is we still don't know when.
*12:31.120- 12:33.780* :  It doesn't feel like to me it's absolutely imminent
*12:33.780- 12:35.620* :  as in the coming hours or tonight,
*12:35.620- 12:37.900* :  but as I say, we don't know.
*12:38.440- 12:39.820* :  And just quickly maybe Tony Blinken,
*12:39.820- 12:41.220* :  I think, back in Israel tomorrow.
*12:41.220- 12:43.960* :  So it would seem unlikely to be Monday.
*12:44.340- 12:46.860* :  Yeah, I mean, he said he will arrive on Monday
*12:47.240- 12:50.760* :  and yeah, I think that's probably a pretty logical conclusion
*12:50.960- 12:53.340* :  that he would be saying that if there was a ground offensive
*12:53.340- 12:54.580* :  about to start.
*12:55.400- 12:56.880* :  One of the key things he's looking at
*12:56.900- 13:00.440* :  is this humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza.
*13:00.960- 13:04.440* :  He mentioned that the raffer crossing between Gaza and Egypt
*13:04.440- 13:06.920* :  may reopen and now that would probably be
*13:06.920- 13:09.840* :  for a very short amount of time to let some foreign nationals
*13:09.840- 13:12.240* :  and dual Palestinian passport holders come out,
*13:12.240- 13:16.480* :  but crucially to let a convoy's go in with supplies
*13:17.100- 13:19.400* :  in reaching this absolutely critical breaking point.
*13:19.620- 13:21.120* :  Warnings from doctors, the hospitals
*13:21.120- 13:22.340* :  are on the verge of collapse.
*13:22.700- 13:24.380* :  And on the water supply,
*13:24.380- 13:27.560* :  what's your assessment of Israel's decision
*13:27.560- 13:29.460* :  to reopen the supply to the south of Gaza?
*13:29.680- 13:31.580* :  Well, I think that too was under American pressure.
*13:31.640- 13:33.100* :  And as you said, we had this announcement
*13:33.100- 13:34.980* :  that the resupply would start to the south.
*13:35.120- 13:37.880* :  Now, speaking to our colleague, Rishki Abu Aluf
*13:37.880- 13:41.460* :  in Han Unis now, where he is fled with his family
*13:41.460- 13:43.040* :  to safety from Gaza City,
*13:43.260- 13:46.100* :  he's saying that there isn't water supply
*13:46.520- 13:49.040* :  because with the power out, the water can't be pumped.
*13:49.420- 13:51.200* :  I mean, that water is polluted anyway,
*13:51.200- 13:52.780* :  the tap water with sea water.
*13:52.780- 13:54.160* :  So most of it is undrinkable.
*13:54.160- 13:57.060* :  You still need bottled water or truckloads
*13:57.060- 13:58.480* :  of clean water to be brought in.
*13:58.480- 13:59.860* :  That was always the case in Gaza.
*13:59.880- 14:02.980* :  So it may not be the kind of silver lining
*14:03.540- 14:04.680* :  that some people were hoping.
*14:05.200- 14:07.160* :  Tom Bateman speaking to me from Jerusalem.
*14:07.660- 14:10.260* :  The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres
*14:10.260- 14:12.780* :  has released a statement appealing for Hamas
*14:12.780- 14:15.340* :  to release all of its hostages immediately
*14:15.340- 14:17.000* :  and without preconditions.
*14:17.580- 14:20.060* :  Mr. Guterres also made a demand for Israel
*14:20.060- 14:22.600* :  to grant rapid and unimpeded access
*14:22.660- 14:26.220* :  for humanitarian supplies to civilians in Gaza.
*14:26.220- 14:30.340* :  He said the UN had stocks of food, water, non-food items,
*14:30.340- 14:32.080* :  medical supplies, and fuel,
*14:32.600- 14:34.880* :  all of which could be dispatched within hours.
*14:36.240- 14:39.140* :  Now, as we've reported, Israel has urged Palestinians
*14:39.140- 14:42.620* :  to move from the northern parts of Gaza to the south
*14:42.640- 14:44.280* :  as it prepares for the next phase
*14:44.280- 14:46.720* :  of its military operation against Hamas.
*14:46.980- 14:48.780* :  Some people, though, are refusing to go.
*14:49.340- 14:51.880* :  Muhammad Shurteh has stayed in Gaza City
*14:51.960- 14:53.380* :  in the north with his family.
*14:53.840- 14:55.280* :  He told my colleague, Johnny Diamond,
*14:55.280- 14:56.260* :  what life is like?
*14:57.000- 15:00.480* :  No food, no water, no electricity, no fuel.
*15:01.200- 15:03.060* :  What I shall go, what I have to do.
*15:03.620- 15:07.980* :  I just stand just at home trying to make the kids
*15:08.220- 15:10.180* :  not become very scared.
*15:10.560- 15:13.280* :  If you are in Gaza, you're hearing all the drones
*15:14.040- 15:15.400* :  over the sky, over the people.
*15:15.900- 15:19.700* :  They are driving lights to check the areas,
*15:20.380- 15:23.500* :  pumping their rockets, pumps to the houses.
*15:24.160- 15:25.720* :  That's the voice, that's me here.
*15:25.720- 15:30.080* :  We cannot do or grow anywhere, everywhere they are pumping.
*15:30.720- 15:33.400* :  Have you been outside of your home?
*15:33.460- 15:35.960* :  Have you been to any of the hospitals?
*15:37.000- 15:40.660* :  I saw at the hospital it become full of IDBs
*15:40.660- 15:41.520* :  even the hospital.
*15:41.940- 15:45.760* :  The ambulances over there, they cannot go anywhere
*15:45.760- 15:48.900* :  because they even attack some ambulances.
*15:49.320- 15:51.260* :  They cannot provide the service.
*15:51.820- 15:54.400* :  Who is with you in your home right now?
*15:55.020- 15:58.480* :  I have my father, my parents-in-law, my aunt,
*15:59.200- 16:03.820* :  my wife and kids, my daughter, it's 12, my son,
*16:03.820- 16:06.680* :  11, and the little one, seven.
*16:07.140- 16:10.720* :  And what do you tell them about what is going on?
*16:11.060- 16:14.360* :  First day, I let them, we did like session for drawing.
*16:14.940- 16:18.940* :  We imagine we draw, and we color the whole
*16:18.940- 16:22.120* :  international states, flags.
*16:22.940- 16:25.420* :  Then second day, we become play sports.
*16:26.080- 16:30.200* :  The third day, we opened the school's book three.
*16:30.700- 16:32.380* :  I cannot fly on them.
*16:32.920- 16:35.100* :  I just only think we have hope.
*16:35.620- 16:37.360* :  Might be Allah will survive us.
*16:37.560- 16:40.480* :  As long we are prepared for Allah to survive us.
*16:40.760- 16:43.400* :  Is that anywhere safe for you to go?
*16:44.020- 16:45.460* :  Where shall I go?
*16:45.900- 16:47.620* :  There are no places to go.
*16:47.900- 16:49.920* :  Ten days back, I was in Israel.
*16:49.920- 16:52.440* :  I just came back to get a vacation.
*16:52.940- 16:55.440* :  And I stuck, and even stuck with my family.
*16:55.440- 16:59.440* :  I was begging the moot to remove, to relicate my address,
*16:59.440- 17:02.120* :  to the west bank, for the safer area.
*17:02.120- 17:05.260* :  But I couldn't, it's not mine.
*17:05.720- 17:09.760* :  I know Gaza strip, it's always having this catastrophic
*17:10.520- 17:12.480* :  escalation, all as we lost.
*17:12.840- 17:17.640* :  Let's become like action and reaction, action and reaction.
*17:17.880- 17:21.720* :  And I believe I am, as one of the people on the loser,
*17:22.380- 17:22.960* :  between boss.
*17:23.680- 17:26.500* :  Well, that was Mohammed Shateh who remains a resident
*17:26.500- 17:27.760* :  in Gaza City.
*17:28.560- 17:31.180* :  As Israel prepares for its ground offensive on Gaza,
*17:31.500- 17:32.800* :  what are the country's intentions?
*17:32.800- 17:36.080* :  The Israeli ambassador to the UK is Sipi Hottopoli.
*17:36.680- 17:39.940* :  My colleague Owen Bennett Jones asked her if Northern Gaza
*17:39.940- 17:42.060* :  should be permanently depopulated.
*17:42.880- 17:45.720* :  The thing we want to remove is Hamas headquarters.
*17:46.200- 17:47.080* :  We're not against civilians.
*17:47.080- 17:50.520* :  So actually, the question is, how the endgame will look
*17:50.720- 17:52.060* :  after Hamas headquarters?
*17:52.060- 17:55.680* :  And of course, all the underground city, think about it.
*17:55.900- 17:58.180* :  So I don't know how Gaza is going to look after.
*17:58.180- 18:00.020* :  The military operation is done.
*18:00.380- 18:02.100* :  But I know Hamas won't be there.
*18:02.400- 18:04.900* :  So we have nothing against the civilians in Gaza.
*18:04.900- 18:06.720* :  Actually, we want to keep them protected.
*18:07.300- 18:09.180* :  And we are creating shelters for them.
*18:09.180- 18:11.820* :  And this is Hamas that is preventing them to get there.
*18:12.300- 18:14.280* :  Would you just to sort of comment on that?
*18:14.280- 18:16.060* :  Because I did put that direct, because I'd heard that,
*18:16.100- 18:18.640* :  and put that point directly to two people today
*18:18.640- 18:19.400* :  who've made the move.
*18:19.440- 18:21.060* :  And they both said that wasn't the case.
*18:21.700- 18:22.640* :  They were free to move.
*18:23.120- 18:25.860* :  Every person that lives in Gaza was called
*18:25.900- 18:28.460* :  to find a shelter in South Gaza.
*18:28.460- 18:32.320* :  We want to make sure that one be civilians involved.
*18:32.360- 18:34.800* :  And this is why we call the people of Gaza
*18:34.800- 18:36.080* :  the last 48 hours.
*18:36.100- 18:40.080* :  We call them to move to the South and area of Gaza,
*18:40.400- 18:43.380* :  including together with international organizations,
*18:43.960- 18:45.340* :  create shelters for them.
*18:45.540- 18:48.100* :  We talked to the Jordanian foreign minister earlier.
*18:48.260- 18:51.140* :  He said he just couldn't see the end point of this
*18:51.180- 18:53.380* :  in that you've made it very clear the objective
*18:53.380- 18:54.640* :  is to destroy Hamas.
*18:54.820- 18:58.420* :  He thought, you know, you can kill 300,000 maybe in Gaza.
*18:58.680- 19:00.760* :  Whatever you do, there'll still be, if not,
*19:00.760- 19:02.900* :  Hamas, then another group that has their ideas.
*19:03.560- 19:04.540* :  Do you worry about that?
*19:04.700- 19:07.200* :  I think this argument is irrelevant
*19:07.260- 19:11.660* :  because think about the Western troops fighting ISIS
*19:12.420- 19:14.900* :  and making sure that ISIS won't have the ability
*19:14.900- 19:17.540* :  to kill any more innocent people.
*19:17.840- 19:19.680* :  So this is the way we operate.
*19:20.340- 19:21.880* :  Americans did that with Al Qaeda.
*19:22.160- 19:24.480* :  The international coalition did that with ISIS.
*19:25.060- 19:27.380* :  And Hamas must be treated in the same way.
*19:27.380- 19:31.820* :  So the international community knows how to fight terrorism.
*19:32.440- 19:33.560* :  And this is what we need to do.
*19:33.940- 19:35.040* :  I guess what I'm asking you is,
*19:35.180- 19:38.220* :  do you think to ultimately solve this,
*19:38.580- 19:39.960* :  it will need a political settlement
*19:40.420- 19:42.940* :  or can it be done with military means?
*19:43.020- 19:44.360* :  Because you know, military means
*19:44.360- 19:45.820* :  have been going on for decades now
*19:45.820- 19:47.300* :  and it doesn't seem to go away.
*19:47.600- 19:48.680* :  I mean, that's, I guess, the point.
*19:49.200- 19:51.020* :  In order to have a political settlement,
*19:51.060- 19:53.280* :  you need to have leadership in Gaza
*19:53.520- 19:56.740* :  that doesn't have as ideology like the Hamas charter
*19:57.380- 19:59.480* :  basically to eliminate the Jewish state
*19:59.680- 20:02.280* :  and to see it as a holy thing to do
*20:02.280- 20:03.580* :  to kill innocent Jews.
*20:03.900- 20:05.800* :  You can't have political arrangements
*20:05.800- 20:08.880* :  with Hamas ideology that is exactly the same
*20:08.880- 20:10.620* :  like Al Qaeda and ISIS ideology.
*20:11.220- 20:12.840* :  The only thing they want to achieve
*20:13.080- 20:15.620* :  and I think they showed to the world their true face
*20:15.620- 20:18.940* :  is killing innocent Jews in their beds,
*20:19.320- 20:21.020* :  in their living rooms, in their houses,
*20:21.520- 20:23.180* :  walking streets from street
*20:23.180- 20:25.940* :  and doing those horrible, horrific attacks.
*20:26.700- 20:30.020* :  The Israeli ambassador to the UK, it's Sipi Hottofli.
*20:30.680- 20:33.200* :  What we heard earlier about concerns regarding the possibility
*20:33.200- 20:34.760* :  that the conflict might develop
*20:34.760- 20:36.720* :  on the Israel Lebanon border.
*20:37.280- 20:39.800* :  A missile fired into Israel from Lebanon
*20:39.800- 20:42.520* :  has killed one person, the first civilian to die
*20:42.520- 20:44.200* :  on Israel's northern border
*20:44.200- 20:46.760* :  in the current conflict, three others were wounded.
*20:47.340- 20:49.940* :  One of the biggest factions in Lebanon is Hezbollah,
*20:49.940- 20:51.980* :  the Iranian-backed Islamist group
*20:52.060- 20:54.580* :  that's widely regarded as a terror organization
*20:54.640- 20:56.480* :  including by the Arab League.
*20:57.140- 20:58.820* :  Hezbollah said it had fired a missile
*20:58.820- 21:00.660* :  which hit the village of Shatula
*21:00.660- 21:02.520* :  near the border between the two countries.
*21:03.100- 21:05.240* :  The Israeli military says it's retaliating
*21:05.240- 21:07.300* :  by striking targets in southern Lebanon.
*21:07.300- 21:09.880* :  Our correspondence and a foster is near the border.
*21:10.720- 21:17.240* :  You can hear overhead the sound of fire whistling through the air.
*21:17.240- 21:19.760* :  It's been near enough at an hour now.
*21:19.760- 21:23.100* :  We've taken cover in a wooded area quite close to the border.
*21:23.440- 21:25.160* :  You can hear all the time.
*21:25.680- 21:28.560* :  The sound of fire going between Israel and Lebanon.
*21:28.560- 21:30.320* :  Most of it seems to be coming from the side
*21:30.320- 21:32.920* :  that we're actually on the Israeli side towards Lebanon,
*21:33.480- 21:36.560* :  but there's been return fire in the other direction as well.
*21:37.520- 21:40.960* :  And I would say judging by the length of time we've been here,
*21:41.220- 21:42.400* :  as I say nearly an hour or so,
*21:42.400- 21:46.240* :  this is the longest exchange that there has been over this border
*21:46.760- 21:47.960* :  since the war in the South began.
*21:48.940- 21:49.480* :  Anaphoster.
*21:52.940- 21:53.440* :  Still to come.
*21:53.860- 21:55.760* :  Run down the warehouses in rural Greece
*21:55.760- 21:58.140* :  seem like an unlikely target for a heist.
*21:58.720- 21:59.760* :  But what is inside?
*21:59.760- 22:01.940* :  Is it money, gold, jewelry, no?

*23:22.540- 23:25.220* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.
*23:25.480- 23:28.400* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity.
*23:28.720- 23:32.100* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world

*23:47.300- 23:50.660* :  Now, there is what could be very significant news emerging
*23:50.660- 23:51.360* :  from Poland.
*23:51.940- 23:53.620* :  Voters there have been casting their ballots
*23:53.700- 23:54.740* :  in a general election.
*23:55.020- 23:55.540* :  Hooray!
*23:56.340- 23:58.220* :  Hooray!
*23:58.220- 23:59.940* :  Hooray!
*24:00.480- 24:01.320* :  Hooray!
*24:01.320- 24:02.720* :  That was the sound of celebration on Sunday evening
*24:02.720- 24:04.600* :  at the Opposition Party headquarters
*24:05.160- 24:08.460* :  after exit polls, and they are still just exit polls,
*24:08.460- 24:11.200* :  as we record this podcast, have nonetheless predicted
*24:11.200- 24:14.520* :  that the ruling Law and Justice Party has lost its majority.
*24:15.200- 24:16.900* :  The leader of the main opposition party,
*24:16.900- 24:19.860* :  the former European Council President Donald Tusk,
*24:20.200- 24:21.880* :  said it was a victory for democracy.
*24:22.740- 24:23.220* :  Yes, sir.
*24:23.660- 24:27.520* :  I have been a politician and a sportsman for many years.
*24:28.160- 24:31.500* :  I've never been so happy in my life with its second place.
*24:32.360- 24:33.460* :  Poland has won.
*24:34.180- 24:35.260* :  Democracy has won.
*24:35.860- 24:37.340* :  We removed them from power.
*24:39.260- 24:42.220* :  Well, I spoke with our Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton,
*24:42.280- 24:44.720* :  and I asked him, scenes of celebrations,
*24:44.780- 24:47.180* :  but these are very early exit polls.
*24:47.180- 24:49.620* :  So, Donald Tusk says it's his victory, is he right?
*24:50.440- 24:51.260* :  Too early to say.
*24:51.460- 24:53.060* :  All we can say at the moment is,
*24:53.140- 24:55.140* :  this is an exit poll, so that's a prediction.
*24:55.260- 24:56.560* :  We've got no official results,
*24:56.560- 25:01.460* :  but the exit poll is showing us that the Law and Justice Party
*25:02.160- 25:05.800* :  won the most seats, but it lost its majority,
*25:05.800- 25:08.280* :  quite comfortably, and significantly,
*25:08.280- 25:13.340* :  three opposition parties who are potential coalition partners,
*25:13.900- 25:17.140* :  one enough to have a comfortable majority in parliament.
*25:17.680- 25:21.480* :  Now, a crucial factor here is the Polish President,
*25:21.480- 25:25.620* :  and J. Duda, who is an ally of the Law and Justice Party.
*25:26.280- 25:29.060* :  He is the man who gets to appoint the Prime Minister
*25:29.640- 25:33.220* :  and who has the first chance to form a government.
*25:33.220- 25:37.100* :  And he has said, as is the tradition in Polish elections,
*25:37.140- 25:41.340* :  that he will appoint the leader of the largest party
*25:41.680- 25:44.960* :  in the election, which, according to this exit poll prediction,
*25:45.640- 25:49.440* :  is the Law and Justice Party to try and form this government.
*25:49.440- 25:54.180* :  But it appears that the Law and Justice has no root to a majority,
*25:54.180- 25:57.280* :  because its potential coalition partners didn't win enough seats
*25:57.280- 26:00.100* :  either in this exit poll, so it's looking pretty good
*26:00.140- 26:03.480* :  for the coalition of opposition parties
*26:04.020- 26:07.440* :  and the leader of the main opposition party, Donald Tusk, who you heard.
*26:07.700- 26:09.760* :  And just quickly, Donald Tusk,
*26:09.880- 26:13.520* :  I mean, in terms of victory, if it is his, whatever the result is,
*26:13.520- 26:16.260* :  it seems that the voters have turned out in the largest numbers,
*26:16.260- 26:17.640* :  I think, since what, 1989?
*26:18.320- 26:20.380* :  Yeah, it's again, just an exit poll prediction,
*26:20.440- 26:21.660* :  but it's 73%.
*26:21.660- 26:24.220* :  Highest since the fall of communism in 1989.
*26:24.220- 26:30.000* :  And significantly, the highest turnout was amongst the 18 to 29 year olds,
*26:30.000- 26:32.740* :  the young people who, more of them voted for,
*26:32.740- 26:34.720* :  Mr. Tusk's party than anyone else,
*26:35.240- 26:38.380* :  and more of them voted than the over 60s
*26:38.380- 26:41.040* :  who were generally tend to vote for Law and Justice.
*26:41.660- 26:45.120* :  Adam Easton speaking to me from Warsaw next to the war in Ukraine.
*26:45.880- 26:49.280* :  Russia's president Vladimir Putin has said his troops are making gains
*26:49.280- 26:52.380* :  around the eastern and southern front lines.
*26:52.380- 26:57.480* :  Has been intense fighting close to the city of Avdivka and industrial hub.
*26:58.000- 27:01.240* :  Ukraine's military, however, says it's still in control of the area.
*27:01.240- 27:04.520* :  From Kiev, here's our Ukraine correspondent, James Waterhouse.
*27:05.240- 27:08.880* :  Invading Russian forces are trying to tighten their noose around Avdivka.
*27:09.420- 27:12.840* :  They control territory to the north, east, and south of the city,
*27:13.340- 27:17.320* :  and seem to be making a push after four months of a Ukrainian counteroffensive,
*27:17.900- 27:20.040* :  which Vladimir Putin claims is failing.
*27:20.300- 27:22.520* :  I'm not sure where he's going, all the way to his position.
*27:23.020- 27:26.200* :  Our troops are improving their position in almost all of this area,
*27:26.360- 27:28.780* :  which is quite vast, he said, on Russian state television.
*27:28.780- 27:29.720* :  Could be asking on the way.
*27:29.820- 27:34.080* :  This concerns the areas of the Kupiansk, Zaparizia, and Avdivka directions.
*27:35.100- 27:37.840* :  The city has been on the front line for the past nine years,
*27:38.340- 27:41.100* :  since Russia backset protests in the east of the country.
*27:41.960- 27:44.920* :  While Ukrainian forces acknowledge the Russians in their words,
*27:44.920- 27:47.880* :  have not stopped assaulting Avdivka in recent days,
*27:48.500- 27:50.000* :  they claim to still be in control.
*27:50.640- 27:53.060* :  Around 1600 people still live in the city.
*27:53.680- 27:55.980* :  Before the war, it was more than 30,000.
*27:56.880- 28:00.200* :  Afghanistan has been struck by its third earthquake in a week,
*28:00.500- 28:01.680* :  killing at least two people,
*28:02.120- 28:04.180* :  and injuring more than 150.
*28:04.840- 28:09.280* :  The previous tremors killed more than 1,300 people and flattened whole villages.
*28:10.060- 28:13.180* :  From Kabul, here's our South Asia correspondent, Yogi Tulumay.
*28:14.020- 28:17.240* :  Dozens of people were rushed to Harat's main hospital after
*28:17.760- 28:21.380* :  another major earthquake struck a rural area that lies to the northwest
*28:21.880- 28:23.660* :  of Afghanistan's third largest city.
*28:24.480- 28:26.080* :  The facility is already full,
*28:26.660- 28:28.600* :  and while aid agencies have been pitching in,
*28:28.900- 28:30.980* :  it is still a struggle to treat the injured.
*28:31.960- 28:35.600* :  Although the magnitude of the earthquake was as severe as the first one,
*28:35.940- 28:39.140* :  the number of deaths is low because people have been sleeping outdoors
*28:39.740- 28:41.400* :  too scared to go into their homes.
*28:42.200- 28:45.420* :  The region has witnessed multiple earthquakes and big aftershocks
*28:45.700- 28:46.560* :  over the past week.
*28:47.420- 28:50.300* :  Thousands have been left homeless and as winter approaches,
*28:50.800- 28:53.040* :  the Taliban government says food, clothes,
*28:53.480- 28:55.820* :  tents, and other aid is urgently needed.

*29:01.400- 29:03.720* :  raising his country's flag in the main city.
*29:04.180- 29:08.180* :  Karabakh was retaken by Azerbaijan's forces last month.
*29:08.820- 29:10.140* :  Ian McWilliam has this report.
*29:10.900- 29:13.320* :  President Ilham Aliyev, wearing military camouflage,
*29:13.320- 29:15.420* :  kissed the flag before it was raised.
*29:15.420- 29:18.920* :  He said taking control of the region from Armenian separatists
*29:19.080- 29:21.140* :  had been the chief aim of his 20-year rule.
*29:21.960- 29:24.480* :  The main city is called Stepanakert by Armenians
*29:24.660- 29:26.480* :  or Khan Kendi by Azerbaijanis.
*29:27.260- 29:30.980* :  Nearly all of Karabakh's Armenian population of 120,000
*29:30.980- 29:33.880* :  fled the territory in the wake of a lightning one day offensive
*29:34.240- 29:35.560* :  by Azerbaijan last month.
*29:36.420- 29:40.760* :  On Sunday, Pope Francis speaking in Rome called for the protection of Karabakh's
*29:40.760- 29:43.440* :  ancient Armenian Christian monasteries and churches.
*29:44.460- 29:46.940* :  We're going to Greece now where there's been a string of high
*29:46.940- 29:51.280* :  profile thefts in the country, but the target isn't money or jewelry.
*29:51.780- 29:52.600* :  It's olive oil.
*29:53.060- 29:53.940* :  Ina Aslan reports.
*29:55.000- 29:59.300* :  Run down warehouses in rural Greece seem like an unlikely target for a heist.
*29:59.840- 30:04.080* :  But thieves have broken through the iron doors to steal more than $300,000 worth
*30:04.080- 30:08.600* :  of olive oil in recent weeks amid a shortage of the so-called liquid gold.
*30:09.220- 30:12.540* :  There have also been reports of people breaking into homes to steal oil from
*30:12.540- 30:17.700* :  kitchen pantries and raiding cemeteries where stockpiles are kept for use in vigil lamps.
*30:18.420- 30:20.860* :  After thefts of olive oil and olives,
*30:21.300- 30:24.800* :  farmers are worried criminals may begin targeting the olive trees next.
*30:25.540- 30:29.480* :  Many are already struggling to make a living after heatwaves and drought led to two
*30:29.480- 30:31.220* :  consecutive bad harvests.
*30:31.900- 30:36.820* :  Olive oil is a staple in the Mediterranean diet, but as prices continue to skyrocket,
*30:37.340- 30:41.320* :  a third of Greeks have switched to cheaper alternatives like sunflower oil.
*30:41.960- 30:46.200* :  A similar spate of robberies in Spain earlier this year led to supermarkets placing
*30:46.200- 30:49.720* :  locks on olive oil bottles, usually seen on alcohol.
*30:50.400- 30:54.900* :  Farmers in the region have blamed what they call the unprecedented poor harvests on climate
*30:54.900- 30:59.540* :  change. Extreme weather events have recently led to food shortages across the world,
*30:59.540- 31:05.220* :  with tomatoes being taken off the menu at McDonald's in India and hot sauce lovers in Mexico
*31:05.660- 31:07.780* :  feeling the sting of red jalapenos scarcity.
*31:08.720- 31:13.760* :  Ina Aslan reporting. Now the American actress Piper Laurie has died. She was 91.
*31:14.400- 31:19.200* :  In a career spanning several decades, she was best known for playing a domineering and
*31:19.200- 31:26.300* :  deranged mother in the horror film Carrie in 1976. Her performance chilled audiences and earned
*31:26.300- 31:27.480* :  her an Oscar nomination.
*31:40.620- 31:45.620* :  Piper Laurie also secured Oscar nominations for her roles in the hustler and children of
*31:45.620- 31:49.800* :  a lesser god. While on television, she's best remembered for the series Twin Peaks.
*31:50.300- 31:54.900* :  At one point, she took a lengthy break from acting to campaign for the American Civil Rights
*31:54.900- 32:00.760* :  Movement. Now to the world of animation and film. Founded by two brothers a hundred years ago,
*32:00.760- 32:07.180* :  the Walt Disney Company has grown from a small animation studio in California to what is now a
*32:07.180- 32:12.940* :  multi-billion dollar entertainment conglomerate, which has captured the hearts and minds of many
*32:12.940- 32:18.600* :  generations and embedded itself into popular culture. To market centenary, a huge exhibition
*32:18.600- 32:23.940* :  of rarely seen artefacts is travelling around the world over the next five years. It's currently
*32:23.940- 32:28.320* :  here in London, where our reporter Iona Hampson was given a special tour.
*32:31.040- 32:35.780* :  The Walt Disney Archives have opened its vaults to capture the technical innovation and the breadth
*32:35.780- 32:41.460* :  of stories the company has told over the past 100 years. My name is Becky Klein and I'm the director
*32:41.460- 32:47.020* :  of the Walt Disney Archives. How on earth do you capture 100 years if something so vast and so
*32:47.020- 32:52.920* :  imaginative? That was the big challenge with creating this exhibition. What we did is instead of
*32:52.920- 32:58.080* :  telling a chronological story, we decided what we would do is go back to our very roots to 1923
*32:58.080- 33:03.140* :  and Walt Disney and Roy Disney are founders and look at what they did that we're still doing today.
*33:03.140- 33:08.780* :  We do a little bit of chronological storytelling at the very beginning, so you're introduced to Walt
*33:08.780- 33:14.160* :  Disney in his story and you see the earliest years of the company and the silent cartoons and the
*33:14.160- 33:19.840* :  things up to the birth of Mickey Mouse and then instead of going on chronologically we tell each
*33:19.840- 33:24.740* :  gallery represents one of Walt Disney's philosophies. While many will enjoy the exhibition with their
*33:24.740- 33:29.740* :  families, I went around it with some very unique guests. In the morning I'll start with a simple
*33:30.900- 33:34.140* :  and then I know that if I can do that scale I know I can do it and then I'll start with a
*33:34.340- 33:39.620* :  oh boy how you powers me Mickey Mouse. I'm Brett Iwan I am the official voice of Mickey Mouse and
*33:39.620- 33:44.260* :  I've had that distinguishing pleasure since 2009. And when you go to an exhibition like this and see
*33:44.260- 33:49.900* :  Mickey everywhere do you think that's me? And no I think Mickey is Mickey. When I see Mickey I see
*33:50.120- 33:54.320* :  Mickey Mouse you know I turn it into the little kid and I get along like everybody else does.
*33:54.700- 33:59.340* :  A couple of steps away from the Star Wars objects I can see the Captain America shield with
*33:59.540- 34:04.960* :  Star in the center. I can see the long red dress that Emma Stone wore as Cruella and also the
*34:04.960- 34:10.620* :  artwork used to divert the visuals for the 1953 animation Peter Pan. It really shows how
*34:10.620- 34:15.940* :  varied the stories are that Disney's been able to show over the years and the exhibition also shows
*34:15.940- 34:23.100* :  what goes on behind the scenes to make these stories come to life. Hi I'm Eric Goldberg and I'm
*34:23.100- 34:28.800* :  an animator and director for Walt Disney Animation Studios. You are surrounded by Disney as you
*34:28.800- 34:35.760* :  probably are for many many years. What do you think it's captured really well? The breadth of what
*34:36.080- 34:43.300* :  the Disney company has done and what Walt has done. These pictures on a wall or monitors is a
*34:43.300- 34:51.980* :  trigger for people to go oh yeah I remember that. It kind of reminds people how much a part of their
*34:51.980- 34:58.360* :  lives Disney is. Some of Disney's past productions have been criticised for their stereotypical
*34:58.360- 35:03.220* :  portrayal of non-white characters and elements of sexism. The issues the companies attempted to
*35:03.220- 35:08.400* :  address in remakes with more diverse casting and revised scripts a move that has brought Disney
*35:08.400- 35:13.820* :  into a wider cultural debate. Dr Sabrina Mittemeyer from the University of Custle in Germany
*35:13.820- 35:17.700* :  researchers the Walt Disney company. They've gone with the times and like you know what
*35:17.800- 35:22.560* :  demographics they want to attract. Overall they're still very middle of the road with a lot of this
*35:22.660- 35:27.360* :  and I think they couldn't just make films about princesses anymore now and they shouldn't be doing
*35:27.360- 35:32.260* :  that either. We're now at a point where people have nostalgia for the films of the 90s. What I
*35:32.260- 35:37.400* :  grew up with is already old and is already getting updated again for a new audience is because
*35:37.460- 35:41.540* :  we've also realised there's some stuff in there that's maybe no longer going with the times in
*35:41.540- 35:47.560* :  terms of like feminism, depiction of women etc. There are two similar exhibitions that will travel
*35:47.560- 35:52.320* :  internationally. While one unit will remain in London until January the second unit will be shown
*35:52.320- 35:57.120* :  in the US city of Chicago from November with more locations around the world announced soon.
*36:01.380- 36:04.760* :  Well that report by owner Hampson and Mickey Mouse kind of.
