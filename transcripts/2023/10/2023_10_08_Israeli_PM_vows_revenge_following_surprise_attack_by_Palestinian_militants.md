*00:55.100- 00:59.720* :  That world has in up and spit out a lot of young and attractive guys.
*01:00.020- 01:05.900* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets. I was overwhelmed, like I had never seen
*01:05.900- 01:11.680* :  anything like this. At the height of Abercrombian fit to success. This was me being carefully
*01:11.680- 01:17.840* :  manipulated. Being lied to, tricked, and traded like a commodity. Investigating allegations that
*01:17.840- 01:25.840* :  would take me into a world of money, sex, and power. This is world of secrets. Season one,
*01:26.180- 01:29.780* :  the Abercrombie guys. Listen wherever you get your podcasts.
*01:34.080- 01:37.300* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:38.840- 01:44.000* :  I'm Janet Joliel, and in the early hours of Sunday 8 October, these are our main stories.
*01:44.660- 01:50.200* :  Israeli air strikes are continuing to pound the Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants launched
*01:50.200- 01:55.920* :  a major surprise attack on Saturday morning. We get the latest from our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*01:56.540- 02:00.600* :  This day isn't over for the people of Gaza and the people of Israel, so the bombardment
*02:00.600- 02:05.780* :  continues in the Gaza Strip, but more importantly for the Israeli government. They are still fighting
*02:06.500- 02:12.080* :  on the borders of the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed on both
*02:12.080- 02:18.100* :  sides of the conflict and dozens of Israelis have been taken hostage. We're the friend coming over
*02:18.100- 02:24.380* :  that he checked if we're okay and his teenage son saw a friend of hers that she's nearly 15
*02:24.380- 02:31.020* :  going in Gaza Strip with her four-year-old sister. In other news, a powerful earthquake has
*02:31.020- 02:35.280* :  destroyed villages and killed dozens of people in Western Afghanistan.
*02:38.640- 02:44.340* :  As we record this podcast, Israeli soldiers and civilians are being held hostage after an
*02:44.340- 02:50.640* :  unprecedented attack by Palestinian militants on Israel. The group Hamas claims to have taken
*02:50.640- 02:56.900* :  more than 50 people after breaking through the heavily fortified barrier that has enclosed
*02:56.900- 03:03.580* :  the Gaza Strip for years. Israel responded by sending dozens of warplanes to strike targets in Gaza,
*03:04.080- 03:09.640* :  and as we record this podcast, they're continuing to pound the densely populated territory.
*03:10.200- 03:15.980* :  Hundreds of people are reported to have died on both sides of the conflict with many hundreds
*03:15.980- 03:22.360* :  more wounded. This resident of a destroyed building in Gaza struck a defiant tone.
*03:26.040- 03:31.140* :  It's a price we have to pay. We have no problem with this, even if they strike us every day
*03:31.140- 03:36.580* :  and our families have to sleep in the streets. This debris will turn into shrapnel which we will
*03:36.580- 03:43.000* :  fire at them. As Israeli forces continue to fight Palestinian government who've infiltrated
*03:43.000- 03:49.280* :  towns mainly in the south, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the army would take
*03:49.280- 03:58.160* :  a mighty vengeance and wipe out Hamas. Since this morning, the state of Israel has been at war.
*03:58.520- 04:03.220* :  Our first objective is to clear out to enemy forces that infiltrated and restore the security
*04:03.220- 04:09.020* :  and quiet to communities that have been attacked. The second objective, at the same time,
*04:09.660- 04:13.580* :  is to an exact and immense price from the enemy within the Gaza Strip too.
*04:14.560- 04:20.500* :  But Garzi Hamad, a spokesman for Hamas, told the BBC the organization's current offensive was a
*04:20.500- 04:24.860* :  response to years of what he called a brutal occupation by Israel.
*04:25.480- 04:31.140* :  Thousands of Palestinians were killed in Gaza, civilians, women and children. We won
*04:31.140- 04:36.720* :  fight for seven to five years in the occupation, but no one listened to us.
*04:36.980- 04:43.120* :  PR had long negotiations with Israel, but Israel continued to do all kinds of crimes.
*04:43.120- 04:48.000* :  The international community should focus on the occupation, which is the longest occupation
*04:48.000- 04:54.180* :  in the world. Just before recording this podcast, I got the latest from Joe Floto in Jerusalem.
*04:54.480- 04:58.500* :  This day isn't over for the people of Gaza and the people of Israel, so the bombardment
*04:58.500- 05:03.680* :  continues in the Gaza Strip, but more importantly for the Israeli government, they are still fighting
*05:04.380- 05:09.040* :  on the borders of the Gaza Strip to retake some of their military posts that were overrun
*05:09.040- 05:14.960* :  dramatically this morning by hundreds of Hamas militants. There is also an ongoing hostage
*05:14.960- 05:19.900* :  situation in two of the small towns next to the border. We understand in one of them 50 people
*05:20.500- 05:24.820* :  are being held in the dining room of the Kibbutz, that's a small agricultural community,
*05:25.360- 05:30.340* :  and they're still trying to resolve that, but we are no nearer to knowing the fate of dozens,
*05:30.340- 05:36.080* :  we understand, of military and civilian hostages who've been taken and we think many of them
*05:36.400- 05:42.760* :  are now back in Gaza and Hamas are saying they are all being hidden away and they will do a deal
*05:42.760- 05:48.280* :  eventually to release their own prisoners who are in Israeli prisons. And these Israeli hostages
*05:48.280- 05:54.120* :  are going to complicate Israel's response despite Mr Netanyahu's war rhetoric.
*05:54.660- 05:58.980* :  Absolutely, well look, I mean it hasn't inhibited them this evening as you'll be aware,
*05:58.980- 06:04.640* :  you know, we are more than 200 dead in Gaza at the moment and the bombardment has been severe.
*06:05.160- 06:11.620* :  We are told by the military in Israel that they are convening thousands of troops in the area,
*06:11.620- 06:17.240* :  so they are running an ongoing operation now to clear up last remaining militancy infiltrated
*06:17.240- 06:21.920* :  Israel, but they are preparing for what they say is going to be a substantial ground offensive.
*06:21.920- 06:27.980* :  That will take time to plan, and of course, ultimately, the thoughts of what happens to those
*06:27.980- 06:33.820* :  hostages in any such event will be foremost in everyone's mind. And there are huge questions
*06:33.820- 06:39.680* :  for Israeli military and intelligence. Completely, this took them by surprise, so on the intelligence
*06:39.680- 06:44.900* :  front, this was something they were supposed to be able to predict, but they didn't. But once
*06:44.900- 06:51.180* :  this whole thing had started, what has shocked many Israelis and certainly many former military
*06:51.180- 06:57.040* :  commentators as well, is just how long it took the Israeli military to react. So we've heard from
*06:57.040- 07:03.240* :  Israeli civilians trapped inside these towns complaining that they've been left alone for 12
*07:03.240- 07:09.460* :  hours sometimes before any military assistance came. And that gives you a sense of just how unprepared
*07:09.460- 07:14.300* :  the military was for this kind of event, but also just how shocked they were and how many losses
*07:14.300- 07:20.620* :  they incurred when militants attacked in force simultaneously at several military bases
*07:21.280- 07:26.320* :  along the Gaza Strip. And that left them with very little capacity to respond quickly
*07:26.320- 07:32.320* :  when civilians were being overrun taken hostage. So huge questions being asked, all of which have
*07:32.320- 07:37.060* :  been acknowledged already, but they will put that to one side now because there is a more urgent
*07:37.060- 07:41.880* :  task ahead of them, which is according to the Prime Minister to strike,
*07:41.940- 07:46.420* :  Gaza hard and to destroy a massive capacity and capability to do this.
*07:46.800- 07:51.740* :  And we've seen Israel deeply divided for months, but now the government of national unity is
*07:51.740- 07:56.500* :  being formed to deal with this unprecedented crisis. Yeah, that gives you a sense of just
*07:57.080- 08:01.400* :  what a shock and what a crisis this is. The people who are joining this unity government
*08:01.400- 08:07.100* :  include the opposition leaders Benny Gantz and Yoel Lapid, both of whom are no fans of Benjamin
*08:07.100- 08:12.920* :  Netanyahu. They are arch rivals and there is no love loss between them in ordinary times,
*08:12.920- 08:18.640* :  but these are not ordinary times. And you quite rightly point out that Israel has rarely been
*08:18.680- 08:24.500* :  this divided politically, probably never in its history. And we've had nine months of rolling
*08:24.500- 08:29.520* :  street protests with tens and hundreds of thousands of people take to the street in opposition
*08:30.340- 08:34.800* :  to Benjamin Netanyahu and the plans he has for reforming the judiciary in this country and
*08:34.800- 08:39.340* :  therefore the control and checks and balances on democracy. But all of that is being put to one side
*08:39.340- 08:45.440* :  given the scale of what happened today. Joe Floto in Jerusalem, Israeli towns and can
*08:45.460- 08:49.000* :  put some close to the border with Gaza bore the brunt of Saturday's attack.
*08:53.920- 08:59.720* :  Let's hear first from the kibbutz of Gaveem. Julian Marshall spoke to Bar Mitzrahi, a young
*08:59.720- 09:03.780* :  medical student who spent the day with his family in a safe room in their house
*09:04.100- 09:08.900* :  to escape the government roaming the streets. Some people may find the following
*09:08.900- 09:14.820* :  distressing. So far we managed to push them away. We already have people, armed civilians,
*09:15.600- 09:21.480* :  demolition men going from home to home and check with everybody's okay. We already have
*09:22.100- 09:32.460* :  IDF presence inside the kibbutz and we are pushing them away, the armed terrorists, yes.
*09:32.680- 09:37.060* :  This is very different, doesn't it, Bar, from what it was earlier in the day when you could
*09:37.060- 09:44.840* :  actually hear gunfire and people walking around outside. So we had a lot of gunfires. We are
*09:44.840- 09:50.880* :  thankful for the people that guard the kibbutz that they managed to push them away. But we had a
*09:50.880- 10:01.260* :  lot of really bad stories coming after our last conversation. My 81-year-old good friend of my mom,
*10:01.260- 10:08.960* :  she got murdered inside a shelter. She didn't lock the door because we are not used to lock
*10:08.960- 10:15.340* :  the door in the kibbutz and I just arrived in a shelter in sport. We have a lot of friends that
*10:16.440- 10:21.120* :  starting to get, we starting to get a report about friends that are missing. That's been to a
*10:21.120- 10:29.020* :  rave also, friends of mine that we're trying to descend the kibbutz's. Some of them are right now.
*10:29.020- 10:35.700* :  We start to get a lot of really bad news. We are still in a fog of a battle, but it seems
*10:35.700- 10:43.880* :  that they kidnapped a lot of teenagers and moms and young children from the kibbutz nearby.
*10:44.200- 10:49.000* :  We had a friend coming over that he checked if we were okay and his teenage son so
*10:49.660- 10:57.660* :  thought so our friend of hers that she's nearly 15 going in Gaza Strip with her four-year-old sister.
*10:58.460- 11:03.840* :  He's a really medical student, Bart Mitzrahi. Well, it's here now from Gaza where in addition to
*11:03.840- 11:08.700* :  the airstrikes, Israel has cut off the electricity to the Hamas-controlled territory.
*11:08.700- 11:16.100* :  Muhammad Umawish is a journalist there. We are horrified by the sounds that are coming closer by
*11:16.100- 11:22.620* :  the minute. Literally nowhere is, say, we are speaking about six hours of continued and persistent
*11:22.620- 11:28.220* :  confrontations, military confrontations across the borders as well as in in the Gaza Strip. So
*11:28.220- 11:33.400* :  it is becoming catastrophic by the minute. And how are you managing without electricity,
*11:33.400- 11:39.680* :  which you say has now been cut? It's just very crucial. It's my if-line to keep providing my narrative
*11:39.680- 11:45.560* :  on my stories to the outside world. It's very crucial as well to keep on providing the necessary
*11:45.560- 11:51.200* :  services for average citizens as well. I'm speaking about the internet. I'm speaking also about the
*11:51.560- 11:56.460* :  generators not only for residential compounds but also hospitals and healthcare institutions.
*11:57.300- 12:04.700* :  This is military tactic that Israel has used previously to cut off several places from the Gaza
*12:04.700- 12:11.400* :  Strip. It's the only source for people to keep on updated as the news are happening and also as
*12:11.400- 12:18.580* :  they are trying to seek shelter at homes. Are people in Gaza aware of Hamas' attacks
*12:19.700- 12:24.980* :  inside Israel today? And if so, what's been their reaction? There's been widespread reactions
*12:24.980- 12:29.480* :  from Palestinians in Gaza to the attacks that are taking place across the borders.
*12:29.480- 12:37.220* :  On one side, I can confirm Palestinians are having this widespread sense of fear and concern
*12:37.220- 12:44.180* :  at the same time as they are anticipating a longer and a very larger in scale and intensity
*12:44.180- 12:50.420* :  Israeli counter-attack. That was Mohammed Mahesh in Gaza speaking to Julian Marshall.
*12:51.060- 12:56.640* :  Well, there's a particular sense of shock in Israel that Hamas has managed to take so many
*12:56.640- 13:01.720* :  people hostage. The former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett, speaking to my colleague,
*13:01.720- 13:06.920* :  Samantha Simmons, late on Saturday, said he was horrified by the way the militants had
*13:06.920- 13:14.660* :  targeted civilians. This is the worst terror attack on Israel in our history. At 6.30 a.m.
*13:14.660- 13:22.660* :  Israel time, Hamas in an unprovoked and a heinous method came and attacked our communities,
*13:22.780- 13:30.760* :  killed women, children, men, kidnapped. We don't know the precise number. And as we're speaking
*13:30.780- 13:38.860* :  right now, there are still over a dozen lives kidnapped and terror attacks going on in the
*13:38.860- 13:44.760* :  southern parts of Israel. What more can you tell us about those ongoing operations at the moment?
*13:45.180- 13:49.880* :  Well, they're very complex because we're talking about civilians. We're talking about
*13:51.040- 13:58.160* :  several hostage situations throughout the day. Myself was talking to folks who are behind the
*13:58.160- 14:04.360* :  doors and can hear the terrorists from just outside their door, maybe two or three meters away.
*14:05.020- 14:10.460* :  And you know, some of them are keeping silent and have to keep their own babies from crying.
*14:10.460- 14:19.040* :  It's reminiscent of other days, other very dark days. This is an undergrowth, deliberate
*14:19.040- 14:27.280* :  attack on the state of Israel. So the state of Israel is at war. We're at war with a terror state
*14:27.280- 14:34.360* :  of Hamas in Gaza and it'll continue as long as it needs to. When you say you were talking to people
*14:34.360- 14:41.040* :  in live situations, can you expand on that? Tell us who you spoke to and what they were saying,
*14:41.040- 14:47.560* :  what they were experiencing. Just a few minutes ago, I was talking to a woman in one of the kibbutz
*14:47.560- 14:54.580* :  him, one of the kibbutz on the southern part of Israel. And right now there are terrorists
*14:54.680- 15:02.020* :  walking around her kibbutz trying to enter any home. All the homes are locked, but they're burning
*15:02.020- 15:08.200* :  up some of the homes and her own parents were murdered from mom and dad. Her brother is in a
*15:08.200- 15:14.900* :  different apartment and she's very worried about him right now. So that's one example. Another
*15:14.900- 15:23.460* :  example is another woman that has a baby and she's been stuck with him since 6 a.m and she's
*15:23.460- 15:28.800* :  running out of food and the baby's crying and she's afraid that the noise that the baby will make
*15:29.360- 15:37.640* :  will gain the attention of terrorists. So we're trying to help our commandment forces and our
*15:39.100- 15:43.320* :  special forces to get there and defend the kibbutz terrorists.
*15:44.220- 15:49.400* :  The former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The UN Security Council will discuss the
*15:49.400- 15:54.780* :  conflict at an emergency meeting on Sunday. There's been widespread international condemnation
*15:54.780- 16:00.760* :  of the Palestinian attack. In an address from the White House President Biden, whose own relationship
*16:00.760- 16:08.180* :  with Mr Netanyahu has been frosty pledged full U.S. support for Israel. Israel has the right to
*16:08.180- 16:13.240* :  defend itself and its people. Full stop. There's never justification for terrorist attacks.
*16:13.240- 16:18.480* :  And my administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering.
*16:18.780- 16:24.600* :  Let me say this as clearly as I can. This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to
*16:24.600- 16:29.460* :  exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.
*16:30.000- 16:35.260* :  I also corresponded to Washington, Barbara Plattasha. What this unwavering U.S. support for Israel
*16:35.260- 16:40.900* :  means in practical terms. It means intensive engagement at every level as we've just had an
*16:40.900- 16:46.240* :  administration official describe to us. It is and will continue to be close coordination between
*16:46.240- 16:50.900* :  intelligence teams, coordination between militaries. Israel is, of course, already heavily armed by
*16:50.900- 16:55.280* :  the Americans, but the Defense Secretary Austin has called this counterpart to see what needs
*16:55.800- 17:00.940* :  they anticipate now. They're flooding the diplomatic zone, the Americans, not just in terms
*17:00.940- 17:06.100* :  of calls with the Israelis, but also counterparts in regional countries to try and prevent this conflict
*17:06.100- 17:11.060* :  from spreading wider throughout the region. They've been on the phone at every level.
*17:11.560- 17:15.180* :  And Mr. Biden said that he would stay in personal contact with Mr. Netanyahu.
*17:15.500- 17:20.480* :  And I think crucially what it means in the near term anyway is that the Americans will give
*17:20.480- 17:25.020* :  the Israelis the space to do what they want to do, what they feel they need to do, which most
*17:25.020- 17:31.420* :  likely means a ground invasion of Gaza. I think you will not hear American criticisms or calls
*17:31.420- 17:37.320* :  to stop any military operation for a while. They seem to be saying that the Israelis should decide
*17:37.320- 17:41.640* :  what to do and then give them the space to do it. And what's the impact of all this on the Biden
*17:41.640- 17:45.160* :  administration's efforts to get Arab nations to normalize ties with Israel?
*17:45.400- 17:49.840* :  While the administration has been focusing its diplomacy on trying to get normalization in particular
*17:49.840- 17:54.460* :  between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which would be a huge realignment in the region,
*17:54.980- 17:58.440* :  and would need to include concessions to the Palestinians, and there have already been
*17:58.440- 18:02.380* :  discussions about that. So all of that's out the window for now, or at least it's been put on
*18:02.380- 18:07.220* :  hold while everyone's dealing with trying to contain and to end the conflict. The administration
*18:07.220- 18:12.700* :  officials said that those talks had a way to go, but he did say that Hamas would not be able to
*18:12.700- 18:17.220* :  derail the outcome. Analysts have been a bit more circumspect. They've said they might not
*18:17.220- 18:21.340* :  necessarily come to a grinding halt, but how things play out could affect what's achievable.
*18:22.380- 18:29.080* :  Barbara Pletasha, many in Israel have compared Hamas's assault to the 9-11 attacks on the US,
*18:29.080- 18:36.300* :  or to the war almost 50 years ago to the day when Israel's enemies this time Arab states also
*18:36.300- 18:42.200* :  launched a surprise attack. Our chief international correspondent, Lee Zusset, told us that this
*18:42.200- 18:47.580* :  latest incursion would also leave a deep impact on Israel's psyche.
*18:48.480- 18:54.300* :  Israel's history is one of all too many wars, ever since the establishment of the state of Israel.
*18:54.300- 19:01.320* :  Wars like the 1973 Yom Kippur War are seared in memories. So is the Six Day War of 1967,
*19:01.580- 19:08.480* :  and so too will this war, because this is a war that we're hearing today from Israelis that they
*19:08.480- 19:15.000* :  have never seen this in living memory. The audaciousness, the scale of the Palestinian attack,
*19:15.700- 19:21.500* :  the number of hostages were waiting for that to be confirmed, but above 50 civilians and soldiers.
*19:22.340- 19:27.560* :  The incursions of armed gunmen into southern Israel for Israelis to say they looked out the window
*19:28.100- 19:35.060* :  and saw armed Palestinians running through their streets. Both sides are now saying they want to
*19:35.060- 19:40.640* :  make the enemy pay, and this moment is also to use the word of the day unprecedented,
*19:40.780- 19:44.900* :  because the political situation is very different from the other complexes,
*19:45.540- 19:50.740* :  escalation of hostilities that we've seen all too often. There's a very right wing Israeli government.
*19:51.320- 19:57.720* :  There is on the Palestinian side deep, deep anger with Israeli policies, with the rising tensions
*19:57.720- 20:02.280* :  in the occupied West Bank. We've reported them. You've reported them in recent months,
*20:02.280- 20:07.000* :  in Jinin, in Nablus, but also deepening dissolution in with their own leadership,
*20:07.000- 20:12.380* :  particularly the Palestinian authority. That means that this moment, as dangerous as it is now,
*20:12.380- 20:19.600* :  it's fraught with even more danger, because both sides are going to try to resolve this with
*20:19.600- 20:25.220* :  everything out there disposal. Are we talking about Israeli forces going in on the ground? Are we
*20:25.220- 20:32.220* :  talking about Israel reoccupying Gaza? In previous tensions, Israel, Gaza wars, as they're called,
*20:32.220- 20:39.220* :  Gaza, Israel, Israel, Gaza. Israel made incursions into Gaza, but they never went in with a full-scale
*20:39.220- 20:45.280* :  invasion, keeping troops on the ground reoccupying. What we have heard from Israel today is that
*20:45.280- 20:51.020* :  preparations are in place for a ground invasion. We haven't heard that the signal has been given.
*20:51.560- 20:55.520* :  We haven't heard that it will happen, but it is on the table.
*20:56.780- 21:03.240* :  Please do set. Now, to some other news, hundreds of people are feared dead after a powerful earthquake
*21:03.240- 21:09.060* :  hit Western Afghanistan. The authorities in Herat province said several villages had been
*21:09.060- 21:13.820* :  completely destroyed. Here's our South Asia region editor, Umbarassan Etirajan.
*21:14.520- 21:19.640* :  Videos on social media showed emergency workers desperately digging through the rubble
*21:19.640- 21:23.680* :  to save people trapped in Herat province. Taliban officials say
*21:23.680- 21:30.060* :  most residents of several villages are unaccounted for. A disaster management worker said more
*21:30.060- 21:35.720* :  than a thousand injured people had been taken to hospital with communications down and difficulty
*21:35.720- 21:41.340* :  in accessing remote regions. The local authorities are struggling to estimate the number of
*21:41.340- 21:48.200* :  casualties. The quake had a magnitude of 6.3 and was followed by several strong aftershocks.
*21:48.500- 21:52.620* :  There have been reports of landslides in some rural and mountainous areas.
*21:53.380- 21:58.380* :  Umbarassan Etirajan. Another official in Russian-occupied Ukraine has been killed.
*21:58.380- 22:03.820* :  Vladimir Malov represented the United Russia party in the town of Nova Kakovka.
*22:04.200- 22:08.380* :  He's the latest of a number of officials who have helped the Russian occupation and subsequently
*22:08.380- 22:14.760* :  been assassinated. Our Europe region editor, Paul Mosv reports. Vladimir Malov was killed by a
*22:14.760- 22:19.560* :  car bomb. Others have been shot, hanged or stabbed. All worked for the Russian-backed
*22:19.560- 22:25.420* :  administration in the area of Ukraine it occupies. Mr. Malov served as local executive secretary for
*22:25.420- 22:31.120* :  the United Russia party, which supports President Putin. His death was described by the regional
*22:31.120- 22:36.680* :  governor as a terrorist attack. The Ukrainian authorities haven't said anything about this latest
*22:36.680- 22:42.200* :  murder. They rarely do. But Kiev does sometimes hint that their forces were responsible,
*22:42.200- 22:48.260* :  and many will assume they carried out this killing. Paul Mosv. The US Senate Majority Leader
*22:48.260- 22:54.220* :  Chuck Schumer has accused Chinese companies of fueling the opioid drug addiction epidemic in
*22:54.220- 23:00.280* :  America. He was speaking on a visit to China, then lowings reports. Mr. Schumer emphasized he was
*23:00.280- 23:04.140* :  not blaming the Chinese government for the fentanyl crisis but rather Chinese companies.
*23:04.140- 23:09.960* :  The Democratic Senator spoke alongside the local Communist Party Secretary after talks in Shanghai,
*23:09.960- 23:15.940* :  where thousands of US supported businesses operate. Mr. Schumer has argued that American firms are
*23:15.940- 23:20.940* :  finding it increasingly difficult to operate, since Washington limited chip exports to China
*23:21.280- 23:27.400* :  over fears about national security. Ben Lowings. Now let's return to our main story. As we record
*23:27.400- 23:34.040* :  this podcast, Israeli air strikes are continuing to pound the Gaza Strip after Palestinian militants
*23:34.040- 23:39.860* :  launched a major surprise attack on Saturday morning. Hundreds of people are reported to have been
*23:39.860- 23:45.340* :  killed on both sides and dozens of Israelis taken hostage in one of the biggest escalations
*23:45.340- 23:52.560* :  of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for years. So what does this attack by Hamas mean for the region?
*23:53.080- 23:56.420* :  With his thoughts, here's our international editor Jeremy Bohn.
*23:57.480- 24:03.180* :  A new war has been a clear and growing danger for months, but no one expected Hamas to attack
*24:03.180- 24:09.040* :  the way it has out of Gaza. Israelis and Palestinians have been focusing on the West Bank,
*24:09.040- 24:15.060* :  the occupied territory between Jerusalem and the Jordanian border, where there's been almost
*24:15.060- 24:22.000* :  continuous violence throughout the year. Religious and national tension, ever present in Jerusalem,
*24:22.780- 24:27.860* :  has risen in the last week or so in the Holy City, but the extent of the Hamas operation
*24:27.920- 24:35.340* :  shows that it had been planned over months. The reasons why Hamas in Israel are once a game at war
*24:35.340- 24:41.040* :  run very deep, even when the conflict drops out of the headlines, grievance and hatred,
*24:42.360- 24:48.180* :  the last series attempt by the Americans to restart a peace process failed a decade ago.
*24:48.760- 24:55.180* :  For a while, in the 1990s, the prospect of peace through creating an independent Palestine alongside
*24:55.180- 25:03.960* :  Israel was a real hope. Now the so-called two-state solution is an empty slogan. At the root of the
*25:03.960- 25:11.140* :  trouble is the unresolved century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of land
*25:11.140- 25:17.760* :  both sides want. What is happening now proves yet again that when it's left to fester,
*25:18.540- 25:21.420* :  bloodshed is guaranteed. Jeremy Bohn.
*25:24.440- 25:28.840* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.

*26:03.180- 26:06.660* :  This is the story of one of fashion's dark secrets.
*26:06.840- 26:10.100* :  I was overwhelmed like I had never seen anything like this.
*26:10.320- 26:12.980* :  At the height of Abercrombian fit to success.
*26:13.180- 26:15.640* :  This was me being carefully manipulated.
*26:15.960- 26:18.860* :  Being lied to tricks and traded like a commodity.
*26:19.200- 26:24.880* :  Investigating allegations that would take me into a world of money, sex and power.
*26:25.880- 26:30.580* :  This is world of secrets. Season one, the Abercrombie Guys.
