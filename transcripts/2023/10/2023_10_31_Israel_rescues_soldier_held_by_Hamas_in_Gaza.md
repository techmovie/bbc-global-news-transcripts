*01:41.700- 01:46.020* :  has been fiercely criticised at a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic.
*01:48.740- 01:49.620* :  Also in this podcast,
*01:49.620- 01:54.780* :  the word pumpkin comes from the ancient Greek word pepon, meaning large melon.
*01:54.780- 01:59.320* :  Around the world, these rotund squashes are turned into lanterns for Halloween.
*02:00.080- 02:03.240* :  And what do you do with your pumpkins once Halloween is over?
*02:03.420- 02:04.740* :  We'll give you a few tips.
*02:10.120- 02:14.160* :  Israel says it's freed one of its soldiers who was abducted by Hamas.

*02:23.160- 02:24.660* :  from Israel earlier this month.
*02:25.240- 02:29.160* :  The group released a video on Monday thought to be recorded under duress,
*02:29.700- 02:32.300* :  showing three Israeli women being held in Gaza.
*02:32.960- 02:37.120* :  One of them fiercely criticises the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*02:37.500- 02:39.180* :  for not doing enough to free them.
*02:39.860- 02:43.400* :  He's described the footage as cruel psychological propaganda
*02:44.040- 02:46.900* :  and has once again rejected calls for a ceasefire.
*02:46.900- 02:51.160* :  Our international editor Jeremy Bowen sent this report from Southern Israel.
*02:51.640- 02:53.700* :  There's good news for one family, at least.
*02:53.740- 02:57.520* :  The Israeli army said it rescued private or a mega dish.
*02:57.700- 03:00.640* :  She'd been held in Gaza since the 7th of October.
*03:01.440- 03:06.200* :  The army released a photo of her with her relief family and said she was in good health.
*03:07.120- 03:11.280* :  For the rest of the hostage families, the agony of waiting goes on.
*03:11.540- 03:15.720* :  The Hamas hostage video shows three women sitting in front of a white,
*03:15.720- 03:16.800* :  tiled wall.

*03:20.220- 03:24.520* :  She addresses her comments to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*03:25.040- 03:29.040* :  She blames him for the security failures on the 7th of October
*03:29.600- 03:32.980* :  that men to mass was able to breach Israel's border defenses,
*03:33.600- 03:37.300* :  killing more than 1,400 people, mostly Israeli civilians.
*03:37.880- 03:41.300* :  Misaloni calls for a deal to free all the hostages
*03:41.800- 03:43.960* :  and to free Palestinian prisoners.
*03:44.900- 03:46.740* :  Her words will hit Israeli's heart.
*03:47.320- 03:50.660* :  Opinion polls just before the ground-offensive started
*03:51.260- 03:55.900* :  suggested around half the population of Israel wanted it to be delayed,
*03:55.900- 03:59.560* :  most likely because of fears for the hostages.
*04:00.340- 04:04.020* :  Prime Minister Netanyahu's response was a ringing call
*04:04.020- 04:06.460* :  to support Israel in this war.
*04:07.040- 04:10.920* :  Victory over these enemies begins with moral clarity.
*04:12.320- 04:14.900* :  It begins with knowing the difference between good and evil,
*04:15.760- 04:16.660* :  between right and wrong.
*04:17.480- 04:19.920* :  Since the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October,
*04:20.340- 04:23.780* :  Mr Netanyahu has not accepted any personal culpability
*04:24.360- 04:26.280* :  for a huge security failure,
*04:26.820- 04:29.720* :  unlike Israel's military and intelligence chiefs.
*04:30.580- 04:34.440* :  In the past, Israel has freed hundreds of Palestinian prisoners
*04:34.860- 04:35.980* :  in exchange deals.
*04:36.480- 04:38.640* :  Hamas has said it will release the hostages
*04:39.180- 04:43.640* :  in exchange for more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails.
*04:44.300- 04:48.020* :  For the hostage families, it has been another turbulent day.
*04:51.740- 04:53.440* :  When I saw Netanyahu's picture on the TV,
*04:53.440- 04:55.000* :  my heart nearly stopped beating.
*04:55.100- 04:56.880* :  On one hand, we were stunned.
*04:57.540- 04:59.940* :  On the other, we felt a sigh of relief that she's alive
*04:59.940- 05:00.980* :  and we can see her.
*05:01.560- 05:03.940* :  Because up until today, we knew nothing whatsoever.
*05:04.740- 05:06.660* :  We really want her to come back to us.
*05:07.140- 05:10.300* :  Hamas took the hostages to gain leverage over Israel.
*05:10.740- 05:12.840* :  The Israelis started their ground-offensive
*05:13.380- 05:16.440* :  when talks to free the hostages were still going on,
*05:16.440- 05:19.960* :  saying they wouldn't grant Hamas impunity.
*05:20.680- 05:23.180* :  By making the video, Hamas has hit back
*05:23.640- 05:26.640* :  with a calculated act of psychological warfare
*05:27.180- 05:29.180* :  aimed at the Prime Minister himself.
*05:30.040- 05:32.660* :  Jeremy Bowen, as we record this podcast,
*05:32.660- 05:36.280* :  the UN Security Council is holding another emergency session
*05:36.280- 05:38.460* :  to discuss the Israel Gaza conflict.
*05:39.000- 05:41.340* :  At the meeting, the head of the UN's Relief Agency
*05:41.340- 05:43.620* :  for Palestinians, Philippe Belezareini,
*05:44.020- 05:46.720* :  described conditions in Gaza as unbearable
*05:47.260- 05:49.380* :  and repeated his calls for a ceasefire.
*05:50.040- 05:52.680* :  We need a safe, unimpeded suspension
*05:52.680- 05:55.280* :  and continuous flow of humanitarian aid,
*05:56.000- 05:59.280* :  including fuel into the Gaza Strip and across it.
*06:00.160- 06:03.700* :  For this, we need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
*06:04.300- 06:07.400* :  This is the fifth time the council has met to discuss the conflict
*06:07.800- 06:11.020* :  after four previous attempts to reach a resolution failed.
*06:11.740- 06:13.860* :  Our correspondent, Nitorfik, is New York,
*06:13.900- 06:16.540* :  and she told us more about Mr. Belezareini's warnings
*06:16.540- 06:19.280* :  about the harrowing plight of Palestinians.
*06:19.980- 06:22.680* :  He said that Israel was forcibly displacing
*06:22.680- 06:24.900* :  and collectively punishing Palestinians,
*06:24.900- 06:29.720* :  and he pointed to the number of children dying, 3,200,
*06:30.240- 06:31.500* :  just in the last three weeks.
*06:31.520- 06:33.840* :  And he said that had surpassed the number of children
*06:33.840- 06:36.760* :  killed annually across the world's conflict zone
*06:36.760- 06:41.180* :  since 2019, and he said they could not be collateral damage.
*06:41.500- 06:44.760* :  And the executive director of the children's agency, Unicef,
*06:44.760- 06:47.240* :  also telling security council diplomats
*06:47.240- 06:49.280* :  that the number of children dying
*06:49.280- 06:51.220* :  should shake each of them to their core.
*06:51.740- 06:55.140* :  And this was just one part of three different briefings
*06:55.140- 06:57.640* :  by UN officials, very sobering briefings,
*06:58.080- 07:00.220* :  just trying to impress upon council members,
*07:00.220- 07:04.120* :  the scale of the horror people in Gaza were experiencing,
*07:04.800- 07:06.460* :  the fact that they had become desperate
*07:06.460- 07:08.680* :  in their search for food, water, and shelter
*07:08.680- 07:11.780* :  as they remain under siege, that the relentless bombing
*07:11.780- 07:14.420* :  had wiped out whole families entire neighborhoods.
*07:14.420- 07:17.620* :  These were the words coming from UN officials
*07:17.620- 07:21.620* :  as they implored security council members to call
*07:21.620- 07:26.240* :  for a ceasefire, to call for unhindered and continuous aid,
*07:26.240- 07:28.980* :  to call for the release of all hostages
*07:29.200- 07:31.180* :  and to call for the protection of civilians
*07:31.180- 07:32.360* :  under international law.
*07:32.720- 07:34.420* :  The U.S. is key in all this.
*07:34.660- 07:37.820* :  Is there any sign that is any closer to backing a resolution
*07:37.820- 07:39.200* :  to bring about a truth?
*07:39.620- 07:42.160* :  Well, the U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield
*07:42.160- 07:44.300* :  expressed in the council that she does think
*07:44.300- 07:47.560* :  the security council should speak on this.
*07:48.000- 07:50.700* :  She discussed how President Biden has spoken
*07:50.700- 07:54.180* :  with Prime Minister Netanyahu, how they have explained
*07:54.180- 07:57.900* :  that even though Hamas is embedded in civilian areas,
*07:58.480- 08:00.500* :  that that doesn't lessen Israel's burden
*08:00.560- 08:02.780* :  to protect Palestinian civilians
*08:02.780- 08:04.820* :  that it added to their responsibility
*08:04.820- 08:08.340* :  to conduct their military operation extremely carefully.
*08:08.340- 08:11.300* :  And they have also reiterated that they want to see
*08:11.300- 08:12.500* :  more aid getting in.
*08:13.040- 08:15.860* :  But diplomats at the moment are negotiating
*08:15.860- 08:17.580* :  a new draft resolution.
*08:18.220- 08:20.220* :  And the language I'm told by one diplomat
*08:20.220- 08:23.260* :  is very similar to what we saw in the General Assembly past.
*08:23.340- 08:25.520* :  There it called for a humanitarian truth
*08:25.520- 08:29.460* :  that would lead eventually to a cease of hostilities.
*08:30.100- 08:32.340* :  But diplomats tell me it's still unclear
*08:32.340- 08:34.840* :  if the United States will get on board.
*08:35.180- 08:36.660* :  And if the other members as well
*08:36.660- 08:38.220* :  will be able to reach a consensus.
*08:39.100- 08:39.780* :  Notatorific.
*08:40.400- 08:43.120* :  Israel is continuing to intensify its attacks
*08:43.120- 08:45.040* :  on the Gaza Strip with more troops
*08:45.040- 08:47.480* :  and armored vehicles entering the territory.
*08:48.140- 08:51.480* :  As spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, Daniel Hagarri
*08:51.480- 08:53.620* :  gave this update on Monday evening.
*08:54.260- 08:54.580* :  OK.
*08:55.180- 08:58.400* :  IDF forces continue with its campaign
*08:59.020- 09:03.320* :  in Gaza with the tanks and the artillery
*09:03.320- 09:05.360* :  and infantry have all joined.
*09:05.360- 09:09.720* :  Everything is coordinated by sea, air, and on the ground.
*09:09.880- 09:16.420* :  In these assaults, we have eliminated dozens of terrorists.
*09:17.140- 09:21.480* :  All is continuing and progressing based on our plans
*09:21.580- 09:23.580* :  and based on the stages of it.
*09:23.960- 09:27.800* :  Earlier on today, we eliminated a terrorist cell
*09:27.800- 09:33.960* :  that cried to launch missiles into the north of Israel.
*09:34.280- 09:38.700* :  And then we, of course, saw re-retaliated.
*09:39.560- 09:42.960* :  Mahmoud Shalabi lives in Bait Leia in northern Gaza.
*09:42.960- 09:46.240* :  Part of the area, Israel has told people to leave.
*09:47.100- 09:48.380* :  My neighborhood was destroyed.
*09:49.420- 09:54.720* :  One simple rocket, just one rocket that hit anybody's home
*09:54.720- 09:58.680* :  without warning and totally destroyed that neighbor's home
*09:58.920- 10:02.780* :  and around seven adjacent homes around it.
*10:03.740- 10:08.440* :  At least then of my neighbors were killed, including children.
*10:09.100- 10:13.060* :  A video by the Palestinian photojournalist Yusuf Al-Sahifi
*10:13.060- 10:15.960* :  shows a car traveling on a road in Gaza,
*10:16.380- 10:18.620* :  stopping and attempting to turn around
*10:19.200- 10:22.440* :  when an Israeli tank appears to fire at it.
*10:23.760- 10:24.520* :  Oh, hi, hi, hi.
*10:24.940- 10:26.460* :  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*10:28.520- 10:29.380* :  He's not here.
*10:30.660- 10:35.260* :  Israel has accused Hamas of basing itself under or near hospitals
*10:35.260- 10:38.900* :  and says that's why it's been telling doctors to evacuate them.
*10:39.520- 10:43.540* :  For they say moving patients, including newborn babies in incubators
*10:43.540- 10:45.800* :  or very sick people in intensive care,
*10:46.220- 10:47.820* :  would be a death sentence for them
*10:48.160- 10:50.820* :  and that they won't move them or abandon them.
*10:51.320- 10:55.040* :  A correspondent for the Abu al-Aluf is in Karniunis in southern Gaza.
*10:55.620- 10:59.160* :  The humanitarian crisis is good and deep and deep and with very little
*10:59.740- 11:03.540* :  it considers not enough to feed about a million people
*11:03.540- 11:08.240* :  who are displaced from their homes in Gaza City and the North
*11:08.240- 11:10.300* :  and who are living in a very difficult condition
*11:10.780- 11:16.380* :  not only in camps and oneroah warehouses and schools,
*11:16.380- 11:19.600* :  but here in this hospital, around me hundreds of people
*11:19.600- 11:21.340* :  on this courtyard of the hospital,
*11:21.660- 11:25.160* :  they are struggling to find food, they are struggling to find medicine,
*11:25.160- 11:28.440* :  they are struggling to find water in this place.
*11:28.580- 11:31.660* :  But today the shocking news was about Israelis,
*11:32.080- 11:35.180* :  tanks are cutting the main highway road to Gaza
*11:35.180- 11:38.520* :  because most of the people here are displaced from the North
*11:38.720- 11:41.440* :  and Gaza City, but they still have relative there.
*11:41.440- 11:46.280* :  About 700,000 people are remain in the Israeli operation area.
*11:46.280- 11:49.280* :  We are talking about Gaza City, the biggest city in the entire
*11:49.680- 11:54.820* :  Gaza Strip and the Israeli ground operation is working in four different
*11:54.820- 11:59.600* :  areas and the focus tonight was in the in the north-western
*11:59.600- 12:04.060* :  part of Gaza Strip where people are reporting about heavy fighting there,
*12:04.340- 12:09.920* :  very intense strikes and shilling also around the al-Quds hospital again tonight.
*12:10.780- 12:12.720* :  Rusty Abu al-Aluf in southern Gaza.
*12:13.480- 12:18.140* :  Western countries have urged Israel to follow international humanitarian law
*12:18.140- 12:21.620* :  as it continues its military operations in Gaza.
*12:22.260- 12:25.160* :  The UN has claimed that there have been clear violations
*12:25.160- 12:27.140* :  something Israel has denied.
*12:27.140- 12:32.160* :  A diplomatic correspondent James Landel considers what the laws of war are
*12:32.440- 12:36.080* :  and how they might apply in the conflict between Hamas and Israel.
*12:36.540- 12:38.900* :  There have been laws about war for millennia.
*12:39.080- 12:41.600* :  The latest are based on the Geneva Conventions,
*12:41.600- 12:45.080* :  agreed in 1949 and their subsequent protocols.
*12:45.740- 12:49.560* :  They're clear that civilians should be protected from military operations
*12:49.580- 12:54.100* :  nor should there be indiscriminate attacks or collective punishment.
*12:54.100- 12:58.560* :  Israel denies its doing either, but the United Nations says there have been
*12:58.640- 13:02.620* :  clear violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.
*13:03.280- 13:07.500* :  As for hospitals, well, the conventions insist they should not be attacked.
*13:07.760- 13:09.940* :  The Alon Levy and Israeli government spokesman.
*13:10.060- 13:13.900* :  Article 13 of the first additional protocol says that the protection to which
*13:13.900- 13:17.960* :  civilian and medical units are entitled may cease if they are used to commit
*13:18.420- 13:22.140* :  acts of war in certain circumstances, civilian infrastructure.
*13:22.760- 13:26.240* :  If sufficient warning has been given to evacuate may become
*13:26.240- 13:28.720* :  under international law, military targets.
*13:28.720- 13:32.280* :  In other words, if Hamas were to base its headquarters beneath the hospital
*13:32.280- 13:37.300* :  as Israel claims, that would not only in itself breach international law,
*13:37.300- 13:41.220* :  but it would also potentially leave the hospital open to attack.
*13:41.220- 13:45.220* :  If Hamas used it to commit acts harmful to the enemy,
*13:45.620- 13:48.260* :  warnings would have to be given time allowed for evacuation.
*13:48.260- 13:53.380* :  And as David Sheffa, a former US ambassador for war crimes issue said,
*13:53.920- 13:57.200* :  any attack would have to minimize civilian casualties.
*13:58.120- 14:00.980* :  It would not be a problem that would be solved by a massive
*14:00.980- 14:06.120* :  airstrike on a hospital that would result in a far disproportionate number
*14:06.600- 14:10.200* :  of civilians being killed. That would violate the principle
*14:10.200- 14:12.500* :  of proportionality under international law.
*14:13.000- 14:16.700* :  One thing is clear, Hamas itself has committed war crimes.
*14:16.700- 14:20.140* :  The deliberate killing of civilians and the taking of hostages
*14:20.500- 14:23.600* :  are explicitly prohibited by international law.
*14:24.260- 14:29.260* :  Israel's allies say that it, as a democratic state, must act differently.
*14:30.140- 14:32.400* :  Our diplomatic correspondent James Landau.
*14:35.320- 14:36.260* :  Still to come on the podcast?
*14:36.260- 14:42.920* :  This man has a smile that lights up a television screen from here to bang or may.
*14:43.560- 14:45.720* :  So what makes the former basketball player,
*14:45.720- 14:48.740* :  Magic Johnson, Magic, and a billionaire?
*14:57.820- 15:01.740* :  Ryan Reynolds here from InMobile. With the price of just about everything going up during
*15:01.740- 15:04.380* :  inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down.
*15:04.820- 15:08.620* :  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer, which is apparently a thing.

*15:35.100- 15:37.860* :  catastrophic consequences from climate change.
*15:37.880- 15:39.360* :  What's going on is this real.
*15:39.620- 15:43.600* :  The climate question is the podcast exploring our planet's changing environment.
*15:43.600- 15:47.080* :  What we're doing across the world to adapt and respond to it.
*15:47.080- 15:51.460* :  The futures ahead of us are very sensitive to the choices that they make today.
*15:51.460- 15:54.140* :  If we don't start fixing it, we're going to be victims of it.
*15:54.180- 15:57.760* :  Can engage the climate question from the BBC World Service.
*15:58.200- 16:00.340* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:02.140- 16:03.840* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast.
*16:04.440- 16:08.120* :  In what's been described as the most sweeping action taken by the US government
*16:08.120- 16:11.860* :  to protect Americans from the potential risks of artificial intelligence,
*16:11.860- 16:16.380* :  President Biden has signed an executive order regulating the use of AI
*16:16.840- 16:19.520* :  to try to reign in a powerful emerging technology
*16:19.520- 16:22.580* :  that has caused both alarm and acclaim.
*16:23.180- 16:24.900* :  President Biden had this to say.
*16:25.700- 16:27.500* :  I'm about to sign an executive order.
*16:27.860- 16:31.640* :  An executive order that is the most significant action any government
*16:32.240- 16:35.980* :  anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security and trust.
*16:36.820- 16:40.500* :  This order builds on the critical steps we've already taken
*16:40.500- 16:45.160* :  to ensuring the AI bill of rights to bring together leading AI companies
*16:45.820- 16:50.720* :  who agreed to make sure AI is safe and a system secure.
*16:51.800- 16:54.420* :  This comes as the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak,
*16:54.420- 16:57.640* :  is due to host a major summit in England on AI.
*16:57.820- 17:02.740* :  Rajini Rajanathan spoke to Ashley Gold, a tech policy reporter and Axios,
*17:02.740- 17:07.340* :  the US news website and asked what the US executive order changes.
*17:08.220- 17:12.000* :  This is the White House putting down a marker saying here on a global stage,
*17:12.000- 17:16.360* :  here is how the US is thinking about governing and regulating AI.
*17:16.580- 17:19.940* :  They want to get out ahead of the UK summit you mentioned
*17:19.940- 17:23.180* :  and say that they are doing something on the American side
*17:23.180- 17:25.640* :  after Europe has moved ahead with the AI Act.
*17:26.060- 17:30.160* :  This basically defines how the federal government is going to treat AI systems
*17:30.160- 17:33.340* :  both in how they use it and how they best recommend
*17:34.100- 17:35.260* :  outside companies to use it.
*17:35.400- 17:36.980* :  So there are civil rights implications,
*17:36.980- 17:38.820* :  there are national security applications.
*17:38.820- 17:40.780* :  It's a pretty sweeping document.
*17:41.100- 17:42.320* :  So I was looking at some of this.
*17:42.460- 17:44.340* :  So first of all, you mentioned civil rights there.
*17:44.340- 17:47.040* :  It says landlords, federal benefits program managers,
*17:47.040- 17:50.980* :  federal contractors will be given guidance to keep algorithms
*17:50.980- 17:53.520* :  from being used to exacerbate discrimination.
*17:53.520- 17:55.460* :  I thought that was really interesting.
*17:55.460- 17:57.160* :  What exactly does that mean?
*17:57.540- 18:03.200* :  It means that now when the private company is maybe going to contract with the government
*18:03.720- 18:08.760* :  to do rental applications or housing applications to buy a house
*18:08.880- 18:10.640* :  or to apply for a job in the US.
*18:11.300- 18:15.040* :  Now the government and private companies will have a set of guidelines
*18:15.040- 18:17.800* :  they can look at to say, hey, are we following the rules here
*18:17.800- 18:21.460* :  to make sure that our AI algorithms are not discriminating
*18:21.460- 18:23.200* :  against protected classes in the US?
*18:23.720- 18:26.200* :  Before it was just kind of up to individual companies
*18:26.200- 18:28.600* :  to make sure they were doing the best they could.
*18:28.600- 18:31.360* :  But now there's actually going to be federal guidance on that kind of thing.
*18:31.640- 18:35.360* :  And also it says there'll be federal guidance on how AI is used
*18:35.360- 18:37.180* :  when it comes to visa applications.
*18:37.400- 18:38.100* :  Absolutely.
*18:38.100- 18:40.820* :  It's been important to the president to members of Congress
*18:40.820- 18:44.680* :  and to a lot of members of civil society groups here in the US
*18:44.880- 18:48.620* :  that AI is not used in a way that could harm.
*18:48.620- 18:50.460* :  These applications are harm immigrants.
*18:50.460- 18:53.820* :  So this is one step the government is taking to try to make it
*18:53.820- 18:55.280* :  sort of a fair playing field.
*18:55.720- 18:59.380* :  Is the premise then from all this that's come in today from the White House
*18:59.380- 19:01.880* :  that in the main AI is not a great thing?
*19:02.300- 19:04.520* :  They are towing kind of an interesting line.
*19:04.520- 19:08.020* :  I think they want America to be seen as the leader on AI.
*19:08.060- 19:12.620* :  They point out that most of the biggest and most profitable
*19:12.620- 19:15.400* :  and successful AI companies are based here in the US.
*19:16.000- 19:19.720* :  So they don't want to sort of have a message that this is all bad.
*19:19.720- 19:21.540* :  We have to regulate it immediately.
*19:22.120- 19:23.620* :  They are sort of going down the middle saying,
*19:23.680- 19:25.040* :  hey, this has to be regulated.
*19:25.040- 19:25.660* :  It's huge.
*19:25.660- 19:26.580* :  It could be dangerous.
*19:26.980- 19:28.620* :  But we're also proud of these American companies
*19:28.620- 19:30.320* :  that have been leading on the global stage.
*19:30.320- 19:32.820* :  And we're going to make sure not to do anything
*19:32.820- 19:34.520* :  too much to sort of hold them back.
*19:35.340- 19:36.680* :  Ashley Gold from Axios.
*19:37.560- 19:40.640* :  An inquiry into coronavirus pandemic here in Britain
*19:40.640- 19:43.880* :  has heard that the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership
*19:43.880- 19:46.440* :  was heavily criticised by his own staff.
*19:47.220- 19:49.840* :  Messages from the Head of the Civil Service, Simon Case,
*19:49.940- 19:52.040* :  said Mr. Johnson could not lead,
*19:52.040- 19:54.680* :  and the government looked like a tragic joke.
*19:55.360- 19:58.280* :  The inquiry also saw a note from a government meeting
*19:58.280- 20:00.760* :  held days before the UK went into lockdown,
*20:00.860- 20:05.400* :  suggesting that Boris Johnson asked why the economy was being destroyed,
*20:05.980- 20:08.860* :  quote, for people who will die anyway soon.
*20:09.620- 20:12.040* :  Our political correspondent, Nicodely, has more.
*20:12.720- 20:15.340* :  Much of the evidence presented to the inquiry today
*20:15.740- 20:18.460* :  paints a picture of senior aid and happy
*20:18.820- 20:21.140* :  and sometimes furious with Boris Johnson.
*20:21.460- 20:24.800* :  The cabinet secretary, Simon Case, wrote on WhatsApp
*20:24.800- 20:28.060* :  that Mr. Johnson changed direction every day.
*20:28.460- 20:32.340* :  One day Mr. Case complained the government was all about fear of the virus.
*20:32.660- 20:35.420* :  The next day, it was in littered rip mode.
*20:36.240- 20:37.980* :  Mr. Case added of the Prime Minister,
*20:38.440- 20:41.580* :  he cannot lead, and we cannot support him with this approach.
*20:42.500- 20:45.320* :  The chief scientific adviser at the time, Sir Patrick Valance,
*20:45.560- 20:48.780* :  described Mr. Johnson as weak and indecisive.
*20:49.600- 20:53.040* :  Mr. Johnson, it appears, received no briefings on the virus
*20:53.040- 20:57.480* :  over a 10-day period in February 2020, despite the growing risks.
*20:58.420- 21:00.480* :  The inquiry was shown a handwritten note,
*21:00.480- 21:04.480* :  documenting a meeting between Mr. Johnson and the then-chancellor,
*21:04.480- 21:08.140* :  Rishi Sunak, in March 2020, before the first lockdown.
*21:08.140- 21:11.260* :  It reads, why are we destroying the economy
*21:11.680- 21:13.700* :  for people who will die anyway soon?
*21:14.500- 21:16.820* :  It includes another comment in quotation marks.
*21:17.120- 21:19.700* :  We're killing the patient to tackle the tumour.
*21:20.460- 21:23.540* :  Imran Shafi, an aid to Mr. Johnson, who wrote the note,
*21:23.960- 21:25.560* :  was asked who had said those words.
*21:25.560- 21:29.180* :  I can't say for sure. I think it was the former Prime Minister.
*21:29.580- 21:33.060* :  Mr. Shafi also confirmed that Rishi Sunak's flagship scheme
*21:33.060- 21:38.740* :  had been dubbed e-tout to help out the virus by England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty.
*21:39.740- 21:42.280* :  Earlier in the daily inquiry heard from Martin Reynolds,
*21:42.280- 21:45.080* :  who ran Mr. Johnson's private office in Downing Street.
*21:45.640- 21:49.900* :  He's best known for an invitation to a bring your own booze party in Downing Street
*21:50.300- 21:54.860* :  during lockdown restrictions, which led to him being dubbed party Marty by some.
*21:55.720- 22:00.140* :  He said today that he was deeply sorry and admitted it was not a solitary event.
*22:01.240- 22:03.640* :  Mr. Johnson has not commented on the substantive,
*22:03.640- 22:07.160* :  but his spokesman says he will give all evidence in due course.
*22:07.540- 22:12.280* :  Nick Erdley, the immediate aftermath of Spain's victory in the women's football world
*22:12.280- 22:15.420* :  Cup in August, should have been a time of national jubilation.
*22:16.060- 22:18.060* :  Instead, the victory was marred in controversy.
*22:18.460- 22:20.880* :  After the then president of the Spanish Football Federation
*22:20.880- 22:23.420* :  kissed the player Jenny Amoso on the lips.
*22:24.000- 22:28.020* :  The outcry that followed led to Louise Rubiales being forced out of his job.
*22:28.660- 22:33.080* :  Now FIFA has banned him from all football-related activities for three years.
*22:33.560- 22:38.740* :  Our Madrid correspondent Guy Hegeco told us more about how the controversy erupted.
*22:39.380- 22:41.300* :  During the celebrations of that win,
*22:41.300- 22:45.620* :  Louise Rubiales kissed Jenny Amoso on the lips,
*22:45.620- 22:49.440* :  and it was a kiss, which afterwards he said was consensual,
*22:50.000- 22:52.100* :  which she said was not consensual.
*22:52.260- 22:55.520* :  And that was at the heart of this massive backlash.
*22:55.880- 22:57.400* :  It was a political backlash.
*22:57.400- 22:59.580* :  A politician's calling on him to resign.
*22:59.580- 23:02.740* :  There were people in the football world calling on him to resign.
*23:02.740- 23:04.840* :  And there was a big social backlash as well.
*23:04.840- 23:09.620* :  This was something which really went beyond football in many ways.
*23:10.180- 23:15.380* :  People saw it as reflecting a certain attitude of many men in Spain
*23:15.380- 23:20.700* :  in terms of consent and the way that men behave in many social situations.
*23:20.820- 23:22.520* :  So it's something which went beyond football.
*23:23.160- 23:26.540* :  But it put a tremendous amount of pressure on Mr Rubiales, obviously.
*23:26.980- 23:30.040* :  And eventually it's led to his resignation.
*23:30.100- 23:34.860* :  But he did dig his heels in for a long time and try to remain in his post
*23:34.860- 23:37.800* :  insisting that he had done absolutely nothing wrong.
*23:38.320- 23:40.180* :  And now, as well as losing his job,
*23:40.260- 23:45.120* :  he's been slapped with this three-year ban by football's well-governing body FIFA.
*23:45.700- 23:49.840* :  In the immediate aftermath, FIFA did actually suspend him provisionally,
*23:49.840- 23:51.780* :  saying it was going to carry out an investigation.
*23:52.400- 23:54.640* :  Now, this is the conclusion of that investigation.
*23:54.640- 24:00.340* :  And FIFA says that Mr Rubiales violated FIFA's code.
*24:00.920- 24:04.440* :  So he is banned from all football-related activity for three years.
*24:04.980- 24:08.880* :  Now, that's seen as a big blow for someone who was so influential in the Spanish football.
*24:08.880- 24:13.540* :  And also on the international football scene, he was a vice president of UEFA.
*24:13.920- 24:17.820* :  I don't think this was necessarily unexpected, but it does come as a big blow.
*24:18.300- 24:21.120* :  He is also facing a criminal investigation
*24:21.120- 24:24.860* :  for possible sexual assault on Jenny and Moso as well.
*24:25.440- 24:27.500* :  And he has said that he intends to appeal.
*24:27.960- 24:30.040* :  He came out with a very strongly worded statement,
*24:30.040- 24:32.680* :  saying that he hadn't been given a fair hearing.
*24:32.680- 24:36.560* :  Basically, FIFA had only heard Jenny and Moso's side of the story.
*24:36.960- 24:38.560* :  And he hadn't given his version.
*24:38.560- 24:42.780* :  He also said that this whole process had been carried out by FIFA
*24:43.260- 24:47.880* :  much too fast that they hadn't respected the sub-time frame that they should have done.
*24:48.400- 24:52.140* :  And he said he's going to appeal against it and he doesn't believe it's fair at all.
*24:52.820- 24:56.000* :  Guy Hedgeko, staying in sport and a bit of magic.
*25:03.600- 25:07.280* :  The American businessman and former basketball player, Magic Johnson,
*25:07.700- 25:10.880* :  has been declared a billionaire by Forbes magazine.
*25:11.560- 25:15.300* :  This makes him only the fourth athlete to join the exclusive club.
*25:15.300- 25:19.800* :  The other athletes are fellow NBA players, Michael Jordan and LeBron James
*25:20.240- 25:21.580* :  and the golfer Tiger Woods.
*25:22.220- 25:24.160* :  Sam Fenwick spoke to Robert Raiola,
*25:24.560- 25:26.560* :  director of the Sports and Entertainment Group,
*25:26.980- 25:29.300* :  PKF O'Connor Davies, New York,
*25:29.560- 25:33.320* :  and asked him to give us a sense of the magic that Magic Johnson has.
*25:33.960- 25:37.620* :  He had magic on the court and he's also had magic off the court.
*25:37.620- 25:40.920* :  He's invested in a bunch of Starbucks Pepsi's
*25:41.280- 25:44.240* :  and he's invented very successfully, invested very successfully,
*25:44.240- 25:46.440* :  a bunch of professional sports teams.
*25:46.840- 25:49.620* :  The Dodges, the LAFC, and the Sparks.
*25:49.940- 25:53.460* :  So he's done really, really well making money on his investments
*25:53.460- 25:54.900* :  in professional sports teams.
*25:55.360- 25:56.720* :  So he's invested wisely.
*25:57.260- 25:58.700* :  Is that the key to it then?
*25:58.780- 26:02.700* :  Or is it that Magic Johnson, if people follow Magic Johnson,
*26:03.120- 26:06.480* :  Magic Johnson, invest in something then the others will follow
*26:06.480- 26:08.020* :  and that makes it more successful?
*26:08.420- 26:11.940* :  He's been very successful and like the other athletes that are on the list,
*26:12.360- 26:14.340* :  they've all made more money off the court,
*26:14.340- 26:16.820* :  off the field as opposed to on the field.
*26:17.120- 26:18.900* :  Now they've done quite well on the field,
*26:18.900- 26:21.680* :  but just not as well as they have done off the field.
*26:22.040- 26:24.140* :  So it's doing the right things and making sure
*26:24.140- 26:25.840* :  you have a right team around you,
*26:26.000- 26:27.680* :  team with advises at Mid-Sautant
*26:27.680- 26:32.200* :  and definitely accounts to help you get along and make sense of all this.
*26:32.340- 26:34.200* :  Because you look at Tiger Woods
*26:34.200- 26:36.960* :  has not been very successful on the golf course of late,
*26:36.960- 26:40.000* :  but he's still in that group of four.
*26:40.260- 26:41.460* :  He's still in the group of four.
*26:41.460- 26:43.960* :  He continues to make plenty of money off the course
*26:44.280- 26:45.860* :  who knows if we ever play golf again.
*26:46.200- 26:47.240* :  I kind of think he'll come back,
*26:47.240- 26:49.780* :  but the endorsements in the golfing industry are huge.
*26:50.100- 26:51.340* :  People keep hoping, don't they?
*26:51.340- 26:53.480* :  And even though he's not playing that well,
*26:54.140- 26:56.420* :  he is still getting those endorsements, as you mentioned.
*26:56.680- 26:59.560* :  He's got a very powerful brand, very powerful.
*26:59.840- 27:02.120* :  Why then are there only, only I say,
*27:02.120- 27:04.960* :  four billionaires in the group
*27:04.960- 27:07.360* :  that are form of professional sports people?
*27:07.700- 27:10.340* :  As much as we hear stories in the US every day
*27:10.800- 27:13.440* :  about a new contract being signed in the different sports,
*27:14.180- 27:15.960* :  they still don't, you know,
*27:15.960- 27:19.220* :  some of the NBA players are making 55, 60 million a year,
*27:19.220- 27:20.960* :  but that's only for three or four years.
*27:21.500- 27:22.940* :  And no matter how much they make,
*27:22.940- 27:24.660* :  they got to pay a great deal of taxes.
*27:25.180- 27:28.080* :  And, you know, they still have to make the,
*27:28.300- 27:29.440* :  in order to be in the billionaire,
*27:29.880- 27:31.180* :  they have to have a powerful brand
*27:31.480- 27:33.440* :  and be able to capitalize off the court.
*27:34.100- 27:36.840* :  Robert Rayola, Director of the Sports and Entertainment Group,
*27:36.960- 27:39.360* :  PKF O'Connor Davies in New York.
*27:40.800- 27:43.480* :  Today, the 31st of October is Halloween.
*27:43.480- 27:46.940* :  It was originally the day before the Christian Festival of All Saints,
*27:47.580- 27:49.480* :  but the tradition, recognised around the world,
*27:49.480- 27:52.960* :  is also commonly associated with folklore of witches,
*27:53.260- 27:55.860* :  hobgoblins and frightening off evil spirits.
*27:56.600- 28:00.780* :  Another more recent tradition is the carving of pumpkins to make lanterns.
*28:01.300- 28:04.020* :  But the big question is, what do you do with the rest of the pumpkin
*28:04.340- 28:05.920* :  rather than just throwing it away?
*28:06.500- 28:08.480* :  Harry Bly has been finding out.
*28:08.820- 28:12.120* :  The word pumpkin comes from the ancient Greek word pepon,
*28:12.500- 28:13.560* :  meaning large melon.
*28:14.280- 28:16.840* :  They're the most famous variety of the common squash,
*28:17.360- 28:19.280* :  with a hard orange or yellow skin,
*28:19.760- 28:22.240* :  and a soft, slightly sweet flesh inside.
*28:23.280- 28:27.520* :  Around the world, these rotund squashes are turned into lanterns for Halloween,
*28:27.520- 28:30.380* :  known in some countries as jacko lanterns,
*28:30.720- 28:33.680* :  a tradition brought to the United States by Irish immigrants,
*28:33.680- 28:36.500* :  originating in ancient Celtic folklore.
*28:36.900- 28:38.880* :  Pumpkins are a good source of fibre,
*28:39.400- 28:41.300* :  and contain a range of vitamins and minerals.
*28:42.140- 28:44.360* :  But in the spirit of reducing food waste,
*28:44.360- 28:46.760* :  can we eat leftover lanterns?
*28:46.940- 28:49.720* :  Felicity Cloak is a food writer for the Guardian newspaper,
*28:49.720- 28:51.320* :  and isn't convinced.
*28:51.660- 28:53.640* :  It's not necessarily perfect for eating.
*28:53.640- 28:57.140* :  The varieties that we see in supermarkets and farm shops
*28:57.160- 29:00.660* :  that are intended for jacko lanterns are bred to look good.
*29:00.660- 29:03.360* :  You know, they're basically like the Hollywood ideal of a pumpkin.
*29:03.760- 29:05.480* :  They're very watery and a bit stringy.
*29:05.800- 29:07.260* :  Not all hope is lost, however.
*29:07.600- 29:10.180* :  Pumpkins can be used in a variety of recipes.
*29:10.180- 29:13.640* :  Felicity recommends roasting to get the most flavour.
*29:13.800- 29:16.200* :  What you need to do is get as much moisture out as possible,
*29:16.200- 29:19.400* :  so if you roast it and then maybe drain it,
*29:19.400- 29:22.220* :  or sort of basically even to really concentrate that flavour,
*29:22.580- 29:24.500* :  you just give it a helping hand in the kitchen.
*29:24.780- 29:27.680* :  There are a number of recipes online for pumpkin soup,
*29:28.100- 29:31.100* :  which involves adding herbs and spices to chunks of the pumpkin flesh
*29:31.540- 29:32.500* :  and roasting in the oven.
*29:32.980- 29:35.360* :  Another method is to grate the pumpkin raw
*29:35.780- 29:37.260* :  and to make sweet pumpkin bread.
*29:37.820- 29:39.240* :  And then there's pumpkin pickle,
*29:39.740- 29:41.420* :  using finely chopped pumpkin flesh,
*29:42.000- 29:43.540* :  perfect for the festive season.
*29:44.120- 29:46.520* :  Pumpkins also contain lots of seeds.
*29:47.200- 29:49.980* :  These can be eaten whole, toasted and seasoned
*29:49.980- 29:51.980* :  and added to salads or soups,
*29:52.440- 29:54.480* :  or ground up and used in baking.
*29:55.820- 29:58.820* :  Harry Blie, I'm getting the most out of your Halloween pumpkin.
*30:01.860- 30:03.000* :  And that's all from us for now,
*30:03.000- 30:05.980* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*30:06.220- 30:08.700* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics coverage,
*30:08.700- 30:09.880* :  you can send us an email.
*30:09.880- 30:13.980* :  The address is globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk.
*30:14.700- 30:18.020* :  You can also find us on X at Global NewsPod.
*30:18.600- 30:20.720* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll,
*30:20.780- 30:22.300* :  the producer was Liam McSheffery,
*30:22.480- 30:24.080* :  and editor is Karen Martin.
*30:24.520- 30:25.320* :  I'm Janette Jalille.
*30:25.600- 30:26.700* :  Until next time, goodbye.
