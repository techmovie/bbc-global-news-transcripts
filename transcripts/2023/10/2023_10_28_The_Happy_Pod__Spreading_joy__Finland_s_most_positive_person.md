*00:41.240- 00:46.440* :  and get a couple to fall in love. And we meet the happiest person in the happiest country in the
*00:46.440- 00:51.540* :  world. This is Andrew Peach in London. Hi, this is Matt in Boston. It's time to make some noise.
*00:51.540- 00:58.440* :  This is the happy pod. Hello, I'm Deepa Wichwanath from Bengaluru, India and you're listening
*00:58.440- 01:03.800* :  to the happy pod. This is Ella from Helsinki and you are listening to the happy pod.
*01:07.840- 01:13.620* :  Also this week, what sort of animal is frank? Oh, he was huge. He was lovely and he was huge.
*01:14.220- 01:18.740* :  His feet were like elephant feet and I was like, where did you come from, buddy?
*01:19.060- 01:24.040* :  The medical benefits of Thai Chi. Groups of people in parks or in little squares,
*01:24.720- 01:29.760* :  all gathering together and doing this exercise to traditional Chinese music. And what it is,
*01:29.760- 01:36.640* :  it's a standing exercise. So yeah, it's stand, twist, stretch. Helping more people make music.
*01:36.820- 01:41.600* :  You go into a cave that's 5,000 years old and there's not much left. But what you do find left
*01:41.600- 01:47.420* :  over is a painting on the wall of how to find food and a flute on the floor underneath the painting.
*01:47.800- 01:52.560* :  And a book inspired by the bird that flew into Daniela's house. It's always been a childhood
*01:52.560- 01:57.340* :  dream of mine to write the children's book and I just had this inspiration of writing a book
*01:57.620- 02:03.560* :  based on a young girl. He befriends a white pigeon and she finds this unlikely friendship with the
*02:03.560- 02:06.000* :  pigeon. Those stories on the way in the happy pod.
*02:10.500- 02:14.360* :  If you're a regular listener, you'll know that Finland is the happiest country in the world.
*02:14.360- 02:20.040* :  Every year there's a vote to find the Nordic nation's most positive fin and this year's winner
*02:20.040- 02:23.320* :  is the TV presenter, Ella Cannonone. She's been talking to Anna Murphy.
*02:23.700- 02:30.440* :  I enjoy very much other people's company. I think we are here for each other. I also love very
*02:30.440- 02:38.440* :  simple things. I love good conversations. I love good food and I am just extremely happy to be alive.
*02:39.240- 02:46.340* :  I think every day is a possibility for an adventure and of course I have negative thoughts as well
*02:46.340- 02:53.640* :  and I have bad days and I have worries and so on. That's human. But I think that it's not that I'm
*02:53.640- 03:00.840* :  always happy and glad and I'm always smiling. Positivity is not about faking a smile.
*03:01.560- 03:09.900* :  If we are who we are and if we let it show, I think people really recognise the authentic happiness
*03:09.900- 03:15.800* :  and positivity. And did you enter the competition? What's the process behind being deemed
*03:15.800- 03:24.180* :  the happiest person? The award has been given since 1993. There is a preliminary jury who
*03:24.180- 03:31.560* :  select and choose the people nominated and then finish people can vote. So then eventually people
*03:31.560- 03:38.480* :  gave me votes and I was given the award. And what was that moment like? There was very surprised
*03:38.700- 03:45.880* :  and I felt very grateful and I also was quite moved because I was thinking you know this is the
*03:45.880- 03:51.740* :  wish of the finished people and if they voted me as the happiest person then I have done something
*03:52.180- 03:57.120* :  right. We've told on the happy pod previously about Finland being the happiest country. Why do you
*03:57.120- 04:05.880* :  think that is? Finland has good social security system, good healthcare system. We enjoy being
*04:05.880- 04:13.540* :  in the nature. We have a lot of lakes and forests. Simple things that make us very, very happy.
*04:13.860- 04:19.140* :  So like us your talk show is trying to promote happy stories. So you're clearly in the same mindset
*04:19.140- 04:23.980* :  as our team here at the happy pod. Why do you think it's important to talk about positive stories
*04:23.980- 04:30.080* :  and share happy news? There is more negativity and negative stories in the world at the moment.
*04:30.420- 04:37.480* :  Every day we hear tragic stories about wars and human rights not being respected and really
*04:37.940- 04:43.220* :  one could get anxious and certainly many people are anxious about the world situation.
*04:44.100- 04:52.020* :  And I always think that it's important to think that we are here for each other and nobody is alone
*04:52.020- 05:01.140* :  and sharing positive thoughts in these times if we can somehow bring some light and some
*05:01.800- 05:08.160* :  moments of happiness in people's life with our show or with greeting somebody with a smile
*05:08.160- 05:15.220* :  or with helping each other in a way. I think it's just makes everyday life easier and only with
*05:15.220- 05:21.560* :  good energy we go forward that I think your podcast is extremely important because it gives us
*05:21.560- 05:28.600* :  the chance to just step out of the horrible world for some moments and I always think that
*05:28.600- 05:36.180* :  there are beautiful things in the world. So just to remind ourselves of those is also very important.
*05:36.860- 05:42.780* :  Congratulations to Ella in Helsinki on remember of the happy pod team. A new study from the
*05:42.780- 05:48.360* :  Chinese city of Shanghai suggests Tai Chi can slow down the symptoms of Parkinson's.
*05:48.780- 05:53.120* :  This research claims those who practice Tai Chi twice a week had fewer complications
*05:53.120- 05:58.120* :  and a better overall standard of life. It's one of a number of studies that's promoted the use of
*05:58.120- 06:03.220* :  exercise for Parkinson's patients. I spoke to our China media analyst Kerry Allen about the study
*06:03.480- 06:08.320* :  and just how common Tai Chi is in China. Oh it's so common. I actually used to live in Shanghai
*06:08.320- 06:13.940* :  myself and I used to see early in the morning we're talking six or seven a.m. groups of people in
*06:13.940- 06:20.600* :  parks or in little squares all gathering together and doing this exercise to to my ears to
*06:20.600- 06:25.920* :  traditional Chinese music and one of it is it's a standing exercise. It involves a lot of twisting
*06:25.920- 06:34.320* :  in very very slow and and lots of stretching. So yeah it's stand twist stretch. It's it's a really
*06:34.900- 06:40.980* :  almost like standing yoga exercise. It's it's really peaceful to watch and and yeah it brings
*06:40.980- 06:47.240* :  all people together. It brings older people together so that they can all stay fit.
*06:47.460- 06:52.460* :  Anyone can do it and I've always imagined that the principal benefits of Tai Chi were mental
*06:52.460- 06:57.540* :  in terms of giving you a you know a little bit of zen time especially at the start of the day
*06:57.540- 07:02.800* :  but this study we're talking about Don and Shanghai suggests actually there are quite a lot of
*07:02.800- 07:09.820* :  physical benefits to it as well. Yes absolutely so this this study looked at groups of
*07:10.680- 07:15.800* :  Parkinson's patients over a period of five years. We're talking about control groups with more
*07:15.800- 07:22.000* :  than a hundred people in and one group carried out Tai Chi the other didn't and what it did was it
*07:22.000- 07:29.020* :  found that the disease progressed much more slowly in Tai Chi groups in terms of their symptoms,
*07:29.020- 07:34.420* :  their movement, their balance. It found the groups had less falls, they had less back pain in
*07:34.420- 07:39.780* :  dizziness and and also it found that their sleep and quality of life just continuously improved so
*07:39.780- 07:45.980* :  it's been credited with a lot of benefits to those who took parts health. Although one thing I
*07:45.980- 07:51.120* :  should mention is that this was an observational study so it was it was carried out just watching
*07:51.140- 07:58.580* :  groups of people and and so there are having questions about is this the follics you know is
*07:58.580- 08:03.900* :  Tai Chi going to be the answer to Parkinson's but but other professors have said that other
*08:03.900- 08:08.000* :  exercises as well like ballet have had similar effects. And she had to be taught it because
*08:08.000- 08:13.620* :  I can see on the health pages of our website BBC.com slash news we've put some images of simple
*08:13.620- 08:19.840* :  Tai Chi positions. Easy to simple as trying to replicate them. Well I think there are so many people
*08:19.840- 08:26.040* :  in China who do know something about it. I mean to me it's it all looks quite straightforward.
*08:26.040- 08:30.860* :  It looks it's simply a lot of bending and stretching but obviously nowadays we're living in an
*08:30.860- 08:36.080* :  era where you can watch videos on YouTube so in effect anybody can do it if they've got access
*08:36.080- 08:42.240* :  to the internet. Next to the spinach fields of British Columbia in Canada and a large tortoise
*08:42.240- 08:47.560* :  who needs a new home. Frank the tank is a sarcata tortoise about the size of a wheelbarrow.
*08:47.560- 08:52.860* :  Hundreds of people have offered to take Frank on but not many can provide the conditions he needs
*08:52.860- 08:58.800* :  as Harry Bly has been finding out. Now I guess I can add to my resume a tortoise wrangler.
*08:59.220- 09:04.660* :  This is Shelley Smith she's a dog trainer living on a farm just outside the city of Richmond in
*09:04.660- 09:11.560* :  British Columbia. Oh he was huge he was lovely and he was huge his his feet were like elephant feet
*09:12.400- 09:17.600* :  they were actually incredibly soft as well which was weird. Earlier in October a few days before
*09:17.600- 09:22.880* :  Thanksgiving in Canada Shelley was taking her dogs on a walk and stumbled across what she thought
*09:22.880- 09:27.420* :  was a large rock in one of the spinach fields. I thought well that's odd it's never been there
*09:27.420- 09:32.740* :  before and I didn't pay much attention to it and later on I was outside and I just happened to
*09:32.740- 09:39.440* :  look up and the rock was moving. Some nearby workers had seen this large rock moving closer to the
*09:39.440- 09:45.340* :  road they were repairing they all went to investigate it was a tortoise and I was like where did
*09:45.340- 09:51.080* :  you come from buddy I mean he was massive and the funny thing is as the workman and I were talking
*09:51.780- 09:57.160* :  he was looking up at us like following along within the conversation like as I was talking he was
*09:57.160- 10:01.160* :  looking at me then the other gentleman was talking he looked over to him it was hilarious
*10:01.160- 10:05.200* :  it was like he was really trying to pay attention to what was going on. Shelley called the local
*10:05.200- 10:10.920* :  animal shelter thinking this was a wild turtle the operator asked Shelley how large an animal
*10:10.920- 10:16.680* :  this was and it was just before Thanksgiving so I said oh think that you are roasting a turkey
*10:16.680- 10:23.320* :  for 24 people and you've got to put that turkey on a giant platter and he said sweetheart you
*10:23.320- 10:28.500* :  don't have a turtle you got a tortoise and that's where Dr Adrian Walton became involved he's a
*10:28.500- 10:33.520* :  local veterinarian with decades of experience with tortoises they try everything to find an
*10:33.520- 10:40.960* :  owner so eventually they shipped him out to me and so I was doing just doing a physical exam.
*10:40.960- 10:47.000* :  Frank is an African sole Carter tortoise native to the Sahara they can grow to be as heavy as
*10:47.000- 10:53.800* :  90 kilograms and can live up to around 150 years already hundreds of people had signed up to
*10:53.800- 10:59.700* :  adopt Frank but as Adrian explains many aren't equipped for such an undertaking. He needs a large
*10:59.700- 11:06.960* :  area to graze during the warmer months of the year and then he needs a decent size enclosure like a
*11:06.960- 11:14.500* :  garage where he can spend the winters I always have to remind people these guys dig so you will
*11:14.500- 11:20.820* :  need to have secure facilities for Frank the tank he lives up to his name. It's not known if Frank
*11:20.820- 11:26.420* :  was abandoned or escaped from his enclosure though no one has claimed him despite local media
*11:26.420- 11:32.640* :  attention. Adrian says during his career torses like Frank are found roaming every few years
*11:33.120- 11:38.000* :  and need re-homing and British Columbia is no place for a tortoise like Frank.
*11:38.000- 11:43.400* :  Put it this way we just hit temperatures this week that would have killed him so it was a
*11:43.620- 11:48.700* :  very close call. Frank is now safe being fostered by an experienced tortoise owner
*11:49.020- 11:54.860* :  until he finds his forever home. Let's talk about the challenge of creating music now because
*11:54.860- 12:00.260* :  getting beyond your bedroom can be hard with practice rooms studio time and equipment also
*12:01.580- 12:05.940* :  but Matt MacArthur of the record company in the U.S. City of Boston is trying to change that.
*12:06.440- 12:11.160* :  Anybody that wants to whether you're a 12-year-old experimenting with music making for the first time
*12:11.160- 12:16.900* :  or whether you're mid-career and you know doing music for a living the space is here for you
*12:17.060- 12:22.160* :  and as a result we get this really beautiful melting pot of so many people this intergenerational
*12:22.160- 12:26.420* :  group all making music for different reasons bumping into each other at the coffee pot and
*12:26.420- 12:30.200* :  building connections and relationships with one another you know of course making music
*12:30.300- 12:34.180* :  is a vulnerable sort of process and so to make a space where people feel comfortable doing that
*12:34.180- 12:41.160* :  is not an easy thing forgive me if i'm sounding vulgar by bringing in money the typical price
*12:41.160- 12:46.400* :  of studio time in Boston is something like a hundred dollars an hour you're only charging
*12:46.400- 12:52.100* :  around ten dollars an hour how are you keeping a float and so it ranges from ten dollars an hour
*12:52.100- 12:57.100* :  to thirty three dollars an hour and the answer to how we stay afloat we serve an incredible number
*12:57.320- 13:02.120* :  of artists and music makers on a monthly basis so in the month of august we hosted almost
*13:02.120- 13:07.460* :  eleven hundred reservations for almost four thousand unique humans and so as a result even those
*13:07.460- 13:15.140* :  low rates do make quite a dent in our operating expenses so do they appreciate you Matt and was
*13:15.140- 13:20.720* :  a reaction do you get from your clients well they don't appreciate me i'm in an office doing
*13:20.720- 13:25.620* :  spreadsheets it's pretty invulnerable they definitely appreciate the quality of the facility
*13:25.620- 13:30.300* :  compared to the level of affordability which is really really disproportionate it is a commercial
*13:30.360- 13:37.480* :  quality facility we see all kinds of effusive customer feedback about how if not for this space
*13:37.480- 13:42.820* :  someone would have been maybe only able to get in the studio one day this year but instead they've
*13:42.820- 13:47.360* :  been able to be in the studio every month or every week and certainly those individuals as well
*13:47.360- 13:51.960* :  that might not have been able to afford it at all are now having their first in studio experiences
*13:52.580- 14:00.040* :  what does music mean for you music is a really deep long standing human pursuit it is in our
*14:00.040- 14:04.400* :  bones quite literally you know you go into a cave that's five thousand years old and there's not
*14:04.400- 14:10.260* :  much left but what you do find leftover is a painting on the wall of how to find food and a flute
*14:10.360- 14:15.380* :  on the floor underneath the painting what we like to think is that by making an environment like this
*14:16.240- 14:21.040* :  people can get back to making music for the reasons that we used to make music and so i think that
*14:21.040- 14:26.020* :  power to bring people together that magical moment where you realize you've created something
*14:26.020- 14:30.060* :  from nothing maybe you just played a drum beat that you haven't heard before or maybe you wrote a
*14:30.060- 14:34.620* :  lyric that you don't think you've ever expressed or that teaches you something about yourself this
*14:34.620- 14:39.620* :  is powerful stuff and we need to keep making space for everyone to participate in that magic
*14:40.060- 14:49.260* :  Matt MacArthur in Boston talking to Jackie still to come the Swedish couple who fell in love chasing
*14:49.260- 14:54.940* :  virtual creatures i started playing again because he was playing and i was a bit interested in her
*14:56.480- 15:00.920* :  so then i wanted to download the game again and how bees are fighting back
*15:09.840- 15:16.160* :  daughter is a podcast from the BBC World Service full of personal insight and thought for letters of
*15:16.160- 15:23.600* :  advice things that can inform you can guide you can support you it's a handbook to life for daughters
*15:24.020- 15:29.500* :  everywhere i want her to know from the time she's very young that she is her own person
*15:29.960- 15:35.920* :  catch up with all episodes of dear daughter seasons one and two now search for dear daughter
*15:35.920- 15:44.220* :  wherever you get your BBC podcast maybe you're among the millions of people who play the computer
*15:44.220- 15:49.460* :  game football manager if you're not this is a game where you simulate being the head coach of any
*15:49.460- 15:54.460* :  football team of your choosing what if you could use the skills you build up to help a real
*15:54.460- 16:00.140* :  national team well that's what Jack Cole has done he's the head of data analysis at Coventry City
*16:00.140- 16:05.520* :  Football Club in the UK and has been helping the small west african nation of Guinea-Bissau by using
*16:05.520- 16:11.560* :  the game's database of player nationalities it just got me thinking there must be some low ranked
*16:11.560- 16:17.160* :  FIFA nation that could take advantage of dual heritage players from a high ranked country which is
*16:17.160- 16:21.900* :  essentially you know not using a lot of the players that they had right so there was always going
*16:21.900- 16:27.520* :  to be a secondary group of players you could select from so i did some analysis and fell upon
*16:27.520- 16:32.240* :  Guinea-Bissau essentially because the african continent seemed to be the easiest to qualify
*16:32.720- 16:37.500* :  to the world cup through and so guinea-bissau was the best country to take advantage of these
*16:37.500- 16:41.780* :  dual heritage and then i just thought well rather than playing football manager I just get in touch with
*16:42.080- 16:47.460* :  the guinea-bissau national team and see if i can make a go of it you know this is excellent so in
*16:47.460- 16:55.380* :  other words the research you're doing to play a video game might actually help the national football
*16:55.380- 17:01.700* :  side of guinea-bissau broaden the field of players they can choose from broadly speaking yes
*17:02.120- 17:07.320* :  i should address the fact that that obviously guinea-bissau have their own scouts and stuff that
*17:08.000- 17:12.540* :  are to some extent aware of a lot of these players it is just a case of convincing but
*17:12.820- 17:17.500* :  but yeah i managed to uncover a few players that they weren't aware of and football manager was one
*17:17.500- 17:24.600* :  of many databases in sort of information sources that i had but yeah so it's been great fun to
*17:24.600- 17:29.200* :  be honest it probably one of the more interesting professional elements of what i do so i
*17:29.220- 17:33.740* :  trying to imagine the phone call though i'm trying to imagine the first conversation where you
*17:33.740- 17:38.140* :  ring up and say i've been playing football manager i can help improve the quality of your national
*17:38.140- 17:44.340* :  side the guy speak to Eric is the technical director his french primarily but i think he just
*17:44.340- 17:48.960* :  couldn't work out who i was what i was doing why i was ringing and i said you know this is going
*17:48.960- 17:53.760* :  to sound strange but have you ever considered these guys and i think as soon as i got around the fact
*17:53.760- 17:59.160* :  that it was weird they were quite happy to see where it was me saying quite appreciative and the team
*17:59.160- 18:05.700* :  has got better as a result of some of the recent signings and is it possible to sort of say
*18:06.000- 18:11.160* :  what they might be able to achieve now that perhaps they wouldn't have before my pitch to the FA
*18:11.160- 18:17.540* :  was they had a kind of top 30 FIFA ranked nation link dormant basically so yeah i hope it's up
*18:17.540- 18:22.200* :  and up really and they're participating the African cup of nations in January so we can see how
*18:22.700- 18:28.380* :  progress staying with gaming cast your mind back to 2016 or thereabouts in a game that got millions
*18:28.380- 18:34.860* :  of people out of their homes catching virtual creatures while pokemon goes viral moment may have
*18:34.860- 18:40.400* :  passed hundreds of thousands of people still play it around the world each day and this is a story
*18:40.400- 18:46.640* :  of how it led to modern day romance andri roaches has this report i'm i'll be in a huge
*18:46.640- 18:53.400* :  pokemon go fan i'm a big pokemon go player currently studying fashion and we met through
*18:53.400- 18:59.460* :  pokemon go the game uses augmented reality so you complete missions and catch collectible virtual
*18:59.460- 19:05.180* :  creatures by heading out into the real world information is overlaid on a version of google maps
*19:05.660- 19:11.680* :  so right now in this park those landmarks from london that you might have seen on the back of a
*19:11.680- 19:18.380* :  postcard become those pokestops i think we both started out in 2016 when it just launched and then
*19:18.380- 19:23.660* :  last year i started playing again because he'll most playing and i was a bit interested in her
*19:24.540- 19:30.820* :  so then i want to download the game again yeah we knew each other a bit like we are in the same class
*19:31.100- 19:36.780* :  but we didn't really talk to each other that much and then pokemon is what really like
*19:36.780- 19:44.020* :  made us talk more and get closer our first date was a pokemon go date and it must have been a pretty
*19:44.020- 19:52.560* :  good first date surely yeah awesome super good lots of shining and the day was okay too how many
*19:52.560- 20:00.640* :  dates have been pokemon go based since then oh lots endless endless i want to ask you about the
*20:00.640- 20:07.400* :  badges that you've got okay i got so i got one really fancy pin badge here says pokemon go
*20:07.400- 20:15.240* :  fest 2023 from here in london the reason i came here to london basically and then i got one
*20:15.340- 20:22.080* :  team instinct badge and that's your team that's my team the only team are you on the same team yeah
*20:22.080- 20:29.100* :  where i had to change team when we when we started like after the first date then i had to like oh
*20:29.100- 20:35.680* :  no she's in the yellow team in team instinct and i was in the blue team so then i had to pay money to
*20:38.520- 20:44.840* :  yeah i think it was a nice like romantic gesture is that what sealed the deal really yeah
*20:45.800- 20:49.580* :  a lot of people might not necessarily think people who work in fashion would be big gamers
*20:49.940- 20:53.760* :  what's it like kind of breaking some of those stereotypes a bit i think a lot of people looked
*20:53.760- 21:01.260* :  down on it in fashion like that you're a gamer and i guess like nerdy stuff and fashion stuff is
*21:01.300- 21:07.440* :  very like opposite to each other but that's what also makes it good to mix them together that's what
*21:07.440- 21:12.220* :  makes it fashion though that's what makes it fashion like that's what makes it cool because it's so
*21:12.220- 21:18.040* :  uncool like gaming is the most fashion thing you can do and obviously i don't want to put pressure
*21:18.040- 21:23.360* :  on your relationship but if there was a wedding how would pokemon go get into it probably because
*21:23.360- 21:30.380* :  i think i'd like to get you in a wedding dress i think it would be more subtle hints to it not like
*21:30.380- 21:35.440* :  it like the whole theme being pokemon but if people were playing pokemon go join ceremony you wouldn't
*21:35.580- 21:41.360* :  like no no not at all it's welcomed now when bees and other pollinators are in the news it's
*21:41.360- 21:45.420* :  often because they're under threat maybe they're fighting back though the asian horners is
*21:45.420- 21:50.900* :  increasingly being found in european countries its arrival is considered a big problem they've
*21:50.900- 21:55.840* :  been observed attacking and tearing apart honey bees but a new study conducted in spain has
*21:55.840- 22:01.720* :  observed another type of bee the bumblebee deploying its own fighting tactics here's doctor tomas
*22:01.720- 22:07.340* :  oshay wella from the university of exeter in the uk initially or even quite early on in the
*22:07.340- 22:11.740* :  areas of high levels of hornets we did notice that the hornets were paying attention and hovering
*22:11.740- 22:17.640* :  around the front of the bee colonies and quite often attacking bees so trying to predate upon
*22:17.640- 22:23.600* :  bumblebees but where things became kind of turned on their head so to speak in what we didn't really
*22:23.600- 22:28.740* :  necessarily expect is what happened when the hornets actually tried to to grab and catch the bees
*22:29.000- 22:35.480* :  is that the bees simply stopped flying and dropped straight to the ground a bit like a brick now
*22:35.480- 22:40.680* :  this invariably would then pull down the hornet that's trying to grapple the bee with it to a point
*22:40.700- 22:45.060* :  that it's sort of slam dunked against the floor and that usually then allowed the bee to escape
*22:45.880- 22:51.140* :  but even if the hornet was able to hold on during this whole process when they landed on the ground
*22:51.140- 22:56.400* :  the bees then turned onto their back and put their sting sort of upward stinging towards the hornet
*22:56.400- 23:00.720* :  while pushing the hornet away with their legs and they'd sort of tussle like this for a few moments
*23:01.040- 23:05.340* :  till eventually the hornets sort of couldn't be bothered anymore gave up and studied trying to catch
*23:05.780- 23:12.800* :  another insect and when you were carrying out this study and you started to observe this behavior
*23:13.880- 23:19.420* :  did you think yeah go little bee this is this is great what you surprised what what was your
*23:19.420- 23:24.780* :  your response when you saw what was going on well personally i thought it was hilarious because
*23:24.780- 23:29.980* :  the hornets will just keep attempting you know they know they won't give up they'll keep trying
*23:29.980- 23:37.520* :  to grab these bees and the bees will keep escaping and kind of leaving the hornets sort of looking
*23:37.520- 23:43.880* :  around and seeming a little bit upset and detected so it was quite a weird thing to watch
*23:44.600- 23:49.320* :  but yeah incredibly entertaining and and i was completely surprised and a pretty happy really
*23:49.320- 23:54.260* :  that the bumblebees weren't getting decimated by the hornets we all thought this was very
*23:54.380- 23:59.640* :  exciting because we hear a lot about all the different threats facing pollinators and bees in
*23:59.640- 24:09.980* :  particular do bees seem to be able to respond to new threats are we seeing any changes in behavior
*24:10.720- 24:16.220* :  i think yeah so it's a very interesting question and there definitely is scope for adaptability
*24:16.220- 24:22.300* :  but i also think it's quite interesting to note that with the bumblebee it might really just be a
*24:22.300- 24:27.480* :  sort of evolutionary mismatch in that there happens to be an existing behavior that works well
*24:27.500- 24:33.160* :  in the environment the bumblebees have evolved in and it also happens to work quite well for
*24:33.160- 24:38.680* :  this new species that's coming in over the horizon now you know the birds and the bees go together so
*24:38.680- 24:44.000* :  if a pigeon flew into your house what would you do i'm not sure many of us would be friend the pigeon
*24:44.000- 24:48.420* :  and then write a children's book about it but that's what daniela did and she got in touch with
*24:48.420- 24:55.100* :  this to share the story of piper myself my partner recently moved house and i decided to unpack
*24:55.100- 25:01.380* :  some of my dad's things my dad passed away October 2020 i picked his photo and my grandson's photo
*25:01.380- 25:07.840* :  on the windowsill went downstairs for 10 minutes i came back up and this beautiful white pigeon was
*25:07.840- 25:13.920* :  just standing inside my house on the windowsill now a lot of people's reaction would be there's
*25:13.920- 25:18.460* :  a pigeon in my house i'd quite like the pigeon to leave partly because you'd be surprised but
*25:18.460- 25:23.920* :  also there are superstitions about birds flying into houses which are very potent in some countries
*25:23.920- 25:30.240* :  but what was your reaction so we weren't initially scared but he's so determined every single day
*25:30.240- 25:35.320* :  he would find a way into my office and eventually i think i just got used to him i just
*25:35.320- 25:42.260* :  relented and now i'm like yeah come in tell me how you've how you've taken your partnership with
*25:42.260- 25:49.480* :  piper and use that in your work he's become quite popular on social media right i posted about him
*25:49.480- 25:54.500* :  and people were telling me what white pigeon signify so there's a lot there to do with new
*25:54.500- 25:59.780* :  starts messages from loved ones you know dreams coming true and there was one particular piece
*25:59.780- 26:04.300* :  that i've read which is about igniting your own dreams and going back to your own passions
*26:04.380- 26:09.720* :  and it's always been a childhood dream of mine to write a children's book from a very young age
*26:10.240- 26:14.800* :  and for some reason i just i hadn't done it and he'd been watching me work every day through the
*26:14.800- 26:20.800* :  window for hours and i just had this inspiration of writing a book based on a young girl he befriends
*26:20.800- 26:27.000* :  a white pigeon she's lost her dad similar to myself and she finds this unlikely friendship with
*26:27.000- 26:34.160* :  a pigeon and the message of the book really is that if we have happy beautiful memories that we
*26:34.160- 26:40.400* :  can treasure and cherish then is anything ever really gone forever and that all came from piper
*26:40.980- 26:44.520* :  and what happens next with piper what's the what's the plan for you and him next
*26:46.020- 26:51.200* :  well we have a book launcher the book is officially released on the 17th of november and then we're
*26:51.200- 26:57.740* :  planning on going on a book tour around the uk and maybe internationally the piper will be coming with
*27:00.500- 27:05.860* :  and that's all from us for now thanks to deeper ella mat jack hilma albin tomas daniela
*27:06.060- 27:10.720* :  a pigeon called piper and a tortoise called frank for taking part remember if you'd like to be
