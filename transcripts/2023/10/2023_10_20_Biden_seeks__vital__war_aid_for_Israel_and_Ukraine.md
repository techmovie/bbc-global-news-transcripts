*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.260* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.060- 00:24.000* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 13 hours GMT on the 20th of October, these are our main stories.
*00:24.000- 00:29.480* :  As we record this podcast, President Biden is due to make an urgent budget request to Congress
*00:29.480- 00:35.320* :  for billions of dollars in military support for Israel and Ukraine. The UN Secretary-General has
*00:35.320- 00:40.560* :  visited the RAFA crossing from Egypt to Gaza and called for aid trucks to be allowed into the
*00:40.560- 00:46.060* :  Palestinian territory as soon as possible. He described this as the difference between life and death
*00:46.060- 00:50.500* :  for those suffering the effects of Israel's blockade. And fears are growing of the conflict
*00:50.500- 00:56.460* :  spreading as Israel evacuates an entire city near its border with Lebanon and continues its deadly
*00:56.460- 01:04.180* :  raids in the occupied West Bank. Also in this podcast, other countries the politicians and their
*01:04.180- 01:08.600* :  partners get called in embarrassing situations Italy from the ancient Romans through to Silvio
*01:08.600- 01:13.680* :  Bolesconi. It's always a bit more over the top. Italy's Prime Minister Sessi is separating from
*01:13.680- 01:17.100* :  her long-term partner after comments he made in a TV studio.
*01:22.660- 01:27.800* :  Now, as we record this podcast, President Biden is due to make an urgent budget request to Congress
*01:27.800- 01:33.940* :  for billions of dollars in new military support for Israel and Ukraine. He gave details of the package
*01:33.940- 01:38.340* :  in a televised address from the Oval Office on Thursday night. I'm going to send to Congress
*01:38.340- 01:44.760* :  an urgent budget request to fund America's national security needs to support our critical partners
*01:44.760- 01:50.380* :  including Israel and Ukraine. It's a smart investment that's going to pay dividends for
*01:50.380- 01:55.520* :  American security for generations. Help us keep American troops out of harm's way.
*01:56.440- 02:00.620* :  Help us build a world that is safer and more peaceful and more prosperous for our children
*02:00.620- 02:06.040* :  and grandchildren. This is only the beginning of the process, though, that requires support from the
*02:06.040- 02:11.360* :  Senate and the House of Representatives. Now, chaos in the latter, which is crippled by
*02:11.360- 02:16.380* :  infighting, as it tries to choose a new speaker, its most senior figure, could prove to be a major
*02:16.380- 02:21.280* :  hurdle on North America editor Sarah Smith outlined the challenge that's facing the President.
*02:21.780- 02:25.920* :  It's easier in the Senate where actually there is broad bipartisan support for sending money
*02:25.920- 02:30.160* :  to both Israel and Ukraine. It's in the House of Representatives where, on the right,
*02:30.160- 02:35.380* :  people don't want to send so much cash to Ukraine anymore on the left. There's actually
*02:35.380- 02:42.860* :  suspicion and some reticence about sending too much money to Israel, and a sense that Joe Biden and
*02:42.860- 02:47.580* :  the American administration are tying themselves too closely to Israel's side in this conflict.
*02:48.160- 02:54.320* :  These are political problems. He has to weave his way through. That's why a sincere and heartfelt
*02:54.320- 02:59.580* :  case was made from the Oval Office to the American people that this is the right thing to do
*03:00.040- 03:06.480* :  and the sensible thing to do for them, hoping that that can overrun the political problems that he
*03:06.480- 03:10.880* :  has. Of course, it remains to be seen whether or not it will work. Well, did the President look
*03:10.880- 03:14.840* :  convincing, because part of his problem, politically, has been, hasn't it, that he hasn't,
*03:15.880- 03:22.500* :  you don't get that sense with him that he is as vigorous as American presidents usually are to
*03:22.500- 03:30.140* :  put it bluntly. Did the address, does the general demeanor of Joe Biden, the fact that he went to
*03:30.140- 03:34.260* :  Israel to what was effectively a war zone? Does all of that count for him, do you think?
*03:34.820- 03:39.380* :  Yeah, he was able to say in this speech, not only had he been in Israel the day before,
*03:39.380- 03:45.280* :  the first American president to go there when it's in a state of war, but also talked about the trip
*03:45.280- 03:51.420* :  he made to Ukraine earlier this year, when he stood in Kiev beside President Zelensky after a long
*03:51.580- 03:58.640* :  and potentially dangerous trip there. So he sounded as though he is a man mistriding the world
*03:58.640- 04:05.520* :  state, taking his case about what he believes is at stake here to the very heart of these conflicts.
*04:05.800- 04:10.680* :  We've had a reminder as well of the simple fact that America's military power is still
*04:10.680- 04:15.840* :  pretty huge, haven't we, overnight? Tell us what you can about the interception of this
*04:16.500- 04:25.300* :  missile and the sense among Americans particularly in the Pentagon about the ability of the United
*04:25.300- 04:31.340* :  States still to project power. Yeah, so what we know is that a US Navy warship in the Northern
*04:31.340- 04:36.240* :  Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and also several drones that had been launched from Yemen
*04:36.580- 04:40.620* :  and the Pentagon said they might have been heading towards Israel, they didn't exactly know but
*04:40.620- 04:45.640* :  they were heading in that direction. The US have deliberately stationed warships in the region
*04:45.640- 04:52.760* :  after the Hamas attack on Israel as a deterrent. They are there to warn countries particularly around
*04:52.760- 04:57.540* :  anybody else in the region who might want to get involved in this conflict that the US is there
*04:57.540- 05:04.300* :  and ready to take action if anybody has any ideas about widening the battlefield here.
*05:04.740- 05:10.480* :  So in many ways taking this kind of action is able to project the military presence that the US has
*05:10.480- 05:15.240* :  and that's the way. Sarah Smith in Washington, DC speaking to my colleague, Justin Webb.
*05:16.120- 05:20.140* :  By the time we recorded this podcast some people had hoped that aid would have begun
*05:20.140- 05:26.600* :  entering into Gaza from Egypt through the crucial RAFA crossing point but so far that's not the case.
*05:26.600- 05:32.080* :  Hundreds of trucks were still backed up loaded with crucial supplies of food, water and medicine
*05:32.540- 05:38.240* :  for the two million people in Gaza who are increasingly desperate. Also at that key border point
*05:38.240- 05:43.500* :  on the southern tip between Gaza and Egypt was the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
*05:44.220- 05:52.260* :  Behind these walls we have two million people that is suffering enormously. On this side we have
*05:52.260- 06:03.620* :  seen so many trucks loaded with water, with fuel, with medicines, with food. So these trucks are not
*06:03.620- 06:12.180* :  just trucks. They are a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death for so many
*06:12.180- 06:22.140* :  people in Gaza and to see them stuck here makes me be very clear what we need is to make them move.
*06:23.120- 06:28.140* :  I just to remind you it was almost two weeks ago that Hamas launched a wave of assaults against
*06:28.140- 06:33.740* :  people in southern Israel killing at least 1,400 Israelis bodies are still being recovered.
*06:34.380- 06:39.460* :  Israel responded to that by declaring a siege of Gaza where Hamas is based and launched a military
*06:39.460- 06:44.260* :  operation against the area which is expected to lead to a ground invasion imminently.
*06:44.260- 06:50.560* :  Hamas officials say around 4,000 people in Gaza have now lost their lives. A correspondent
*06:50.560- 06:54.300* :  Andrew Harding is making his way to Gaza from the Egypt side of the border.
*06:54.860- 07:01.960* :  We just arrived here in Egypt close to the border with Gaza with a consignment of humanitarian aid,
*07:02.020- 07:08.840* :  medical aid from Jordan that's just been flown in on a cargo plane. We're about 45-50 kilometers
*07:08.840- 07:16.260* :  from the Egyptian border with Gaza. This consignment will join all the other international humanitarian aid
*07:16.260- 07:22.700* :  that is now waiting to get into Gaza for the people there so desperate for outside help.
*07:23.560- 07:29.180* :  This is going to be just the start of a very long very complicated international humanitarian
*07:29.180- 07:36.660* :  mission or plenty of threats ahead security wise. The Israelis are still bombing south of Gaza
*07:36.660- 07:42.320* :  close to the border. The Israelis themselves are very concerned that this humanitarian corridor
*07:42.320- 07:49.480* :  could be used by their enemies Hamas to smuggle in arms weapons and then there's the real danger
*07:49.480- 07:56.200* :  that at any moment all this could stop because the Israeli ground offensive into Gaza might begin.
*07:57.240- 08:02.840* :  Andrew Harding reporting from Egypt, while as things stand it appears that Egypt has opened its
*08:02.840- 08:08.960* :  part of the border crossing but the Palestinian side remains closed. We got an update from our reporter
*08:08.960- 08:14.600* :  Abdul-Baseh Hassan from BBC Arabic who's based in the Egyptian capital Cairo. Even after the
*08:14.620- 08:21.380* :  distance between the two gates which is like some 600 meters square meters has been destroyed by
*08:21.380- 08:26.120* :  the Israeli strike is over the weeks has been bathed recently or this morning and the bird.
*08:26.120- 08:32.480* :  Unfortunately the high hopes of the morning faded and no change. The still the tracks
*08:32.480- 08:39.740* :  lures and the huge amount of supplies waiting to come in to Gaza are not expectedly at least in
*08:39.740- 08:47.220* :  the foreseeable hours today to enter Gaza for the reasons that and according to Geteris the absence
*08:47.220- 08:54.440* :  of ceasefire. Therefore he asked immediately to have an immediate what he called humanitarian ceasefire
*08:54.700- 08:59.440* :  and the question about who is going to receive the aid especially after Israel conditioned that
*08:59.440- 09:03.900* :  it shouldn't go to Hamas. To Abdul-Baseh, can I just check so it's your understanding based on what
*09:03.900- 09:09.080* :  Antuna Guterish said in the last few hours that it's an absence of a ceasefire on the Israeli side that
*09:09.080- 09:12.400* :  is preventing the border from opening and preventing the aid from going across.
*09:12.740- 09:17.740* :  He openly called for a during the prison he said we'd like to have a humanitarian ceasefire
*09:17.860- 09:24.280* :  this is one thing and he asked for we have to have as many as we can of authorized tracks to go in
*09:24.640- 09:29.680* :  and this should be an immediate land. He also said that there are conditions which are still
*09:29.680- 09:34.260* :  practically hindering the aid from coming into Gaza as bland.
*09:34.980- 09:40.140* :  Abdul-Baseh Hassan reporting while let's go now to the south of Israel where our chief international
*09:40.140- 09:45.440* :  correspondent Leastu Set is reporting from. She told me about the expected ground offensive.
*09:45.980- 09:50.960* :  Well of course everyone is waiting most of all the people of the Gaza strip already under
*09:51.720- 09:58.380* :  non-stop bombardment night and day when that ground incursion starts because the militaries
*09:58.380- 10:03.840* :  escalation will be much much worse than they're already living through now in nightmarish
*10:04.240- 10:09.080* :  conditions. When the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went to the border yesterday with
*10:09.080- 10:15.240* :  the defense minister Yohav Galant he said that you can see he told the forces you can see Gaza
*10:15.240- 10:20.440* :  from here and you can you can see it on the horizon but you will soon see inside Gaza.
*10:21.120- 10:27.180* :  Now whether that is just a way to maintain Morale a state of readiness because the you can't
*10:27.180- 10:32.880* :  any military commander will tell you it's not good to keep that large number hundreds of thousands
*10:32.880- 10:39.680* :  of troops waiting on a border waiting for a highly risky operation to start that you should do it
*10:39.680- 10:44.700* :  as soon as possible but we also heard from the Israeli defense forces in the past hour and they
*10:44.700- 10:49.380* :  say that they are now bombing that the Air Force is in action across the Gaza strip in a way it
*10:49.380- 10:55.740* :  hasn't been for the past a decade and saying they are preparing for the next phase so what can we
*10:55.740- 11:02.920* :  read into that they must be trying to strike and destroy as much of Hamas's infrastructure their
*11:02.920- 11:09.200* :  communications network the homes of Hamas leaders and their families the Hamas high command
*11:09.200- 11:15.680* :  political leaders to destroy as much as possible causes much damage and as much deaths they made
*11:15.680- 11:21.460* :  it clear they want to kill everyone belonging to Hamas before they go in on the ground and we know
*11:21.460- 11:27.640* :  that about a week ago they said they did actually make an increase in a very limited raid into Gaza
*11:27.640- 11:33.840* :  to try to get more information about the location of the hostages to locate some Hamas cells
*11:34.220- 11:39.900* :  they may be doing more than is obvious but they they're starting to push back against
*11:39.980- 11:44.760* :  everyone asking them when is it going to start in fact an idea of spokesman a few days ago said
*11:45.320- 11:49.100* :  you're all talking about it but we might do something different and that's true they are
*11:49.100- 11:53.340* :  making changing their assessments with every day their assessment of the battlefield
*11:54.200- 11:58.540* :  least you said reporting from the south of Israel but in the north of the country there is stark
*11:58.540- 12:03.920* :  evidence of the heightened tension and fears of a serious escalation at the border with Lebanon
*12:04.360- 12:09.020* :  that disputed border is a major flashpoint where the militant group Hasbollah is involved in
*12:09.020- 12:15.200* :  almost daily fire and exchanges with Israel's military Israel has begun to evacuate thousands of
*12:15.200- 12:20.260* :  people from the city of Kiryat Shimonah as rocket attacks from across the border continue
*12:20.540- 12:25.680* :  Hugo Bachega spoke to us from Beirut the news that the Israeli authorities are evacuating
*12:25.680- 12:32.440* :  Kiryat Shimonah I think shows how tense the situation is this is in a part of the region that
*12:32.440- 12:38.680* :  has been heavily targeted by those militants here in Lebanon and so I think the concern here
*12:39.040- 12:44.340* :  is that this could become another front in this conflict and I think to understand what's
*12:44.340- 12:49.720* :  happening here you need to understand you know the road that Iran plays because I think any kind
*12:49.720- 12:55.500* :  of decision that's going to be made in terms of how Hasbollah is going to act will probably be taken
*12:55.500- 13:02.280* :  in Iran Iran is Hasbollah's main supporter it is part of the resistance front if you like which
*13:02.280- 13:07.620* :  is an alliance of forces that Iran backs here in the region Hasbollah here in Lebanon but also
*13:07.620- 13:15.540* :  groups in Syria in Iraq in Yemen but Hasbollah is the main force in this alliance and the Israeli
*13:15.540- 13:21.340* :  authorities have been warning Iran and also Hasbollah that any kind of escalation of violence
*13:21.340- 13:27.680* :  would lead to a very harsh Israeli response that obviously means that Hasbollah would be you know
*13:27.680- 13:34.700* :  suffering a massive blow and that would obviously harm Iran's interests in the region so I think all
*13:34.700- 13:41.320* :  those factors are being considered behind the scenes when we discuss what Hasbollah is going to do
*13:41.820- 13:46.640* :  Hugo Bacheca reporting from Lebanon as Israeli soldiers prepared to move into Gaza
*13:47.380- 13:52.200* :  Israeli cabinet ministers have been visiting the scenes of some of the massacres carried out by Hamas
*13:52.200- 13:58.400* :  almost two weeks ago the BBC was given access to one of those visits with near Bakat who went to
*13:58.400- 14:03.800* :  Kibbut's Qafar Gaza where women and children were among the 50 Israelis who were murdered
*14:15.280- 14:21.720* :  Hamas rockets are still being fired towards Israel while we wait as a checkpoint near the border
*14:23.240- 14:30.580* :  most intercepted by Israel's iron dome the intense airstrikes haven't silenced Hamas
*14:34.980- 14:40.280* :  we joined an Israeli cabinet minister on a visit to one of the scenes of this month's massacre
*14:44.080- 14:51.060* :  is pistol an armed van just a precaution along the way we passed convoy's of military vehicles
*14:51.260- 14:57.800* :  all these trucks going passing us now they will be involved in a major offensive I didn't say that
*14:58.120- 15:02.140* :  I'm not going to say what they're going to do I said that they have a green light to do and when
*15:03.320- 15:07.880* :  whenever they want and how long will it take as long as it takes
*15:07.900- 15:17.920* :  this is written with blood near Bakat is one of the first ministers to come to see for
*15:17.920- 15:26.040* :  himself the carnage and devastation Kibbut's Qafar Gaza is where more than 50 Israelis were
*15:26.040- 15:31.140* :  murdered families women and children others taken hostage
*15:34.900- 15:41.140* :  this is just walking through this house which is just stained with blood on the floor
*15:43.340- 15:49.860* :  just this one home several family members were killed some were taken hostage they don't know how many
*15:52.820- 15:58.420* :  we were here over here there's a Hamas headband they left
*16:02.980- 16:07.560* :  you've had to look around here for the first time what's your feelings
*16:09.980- 16:17.220* :  I've been to war this is not war this is hell I just can't think of what these people went through
*16:17.220- 16:26.720* :  the hell they went through what's going to happen to Hamas now Hamas will be wiped out from the
*16:26.720- 16:35.680* :  from the face of the world how with force with force so these really troops will be going in
*16:36.800- 16:46.180* :  with force I said force can't to to understand why to understand why israel has to finish this war
*16:48.380- 16:54.060* :  this is one of the Israeli Kibbut's closest to Gaza you can see it the buildings in the
*16:54.060- 17:00.880* :  distance they're just a few kilometers away you go over here drones up above occasionally the
*17:00.900- 17:05.940* :  sound of artillery is really artillery going out and it's just clear they are preparing for war
*17:08.440- 17:15.220* :  in the distance you can see into Gaza just beyond the gates which Hamas broke through to bring
*17:15.220- 17:23.620* :  their mayhem and murder the Israeli forces messing nearby are now just awaiting the order to enter
*17:24.500- 17:31.000* :  Jonathan Bill reporting Udi Goren is an Israeli man whose cousin was one of about 200 people kidnapped
*17:31.000- 17:37.100* :  by Hamas nearly two weeks ago Israel says it believes most of them are still alive despite the
*17:37.100- 17:41.980* :  calls for revenge by many he is calling for a de-escalation of the crisis and he told my colleague
*17:41.980- 17:49.280* :  James Coppano why it's a horrible situation because aside from the 200 people who have been kidnapped
*17:50.020- 17:56.560* :  there are also another hundred two two hundred that are missing and we don't currently know what
*17:56.620- 18:02.820* :  what happened to them and we would not know until the fighting ends and right now Tal is missing
*18:02.820- 18:11.700* :  even though his phone was last traced to Gaza so many in Israel seem to be rallying behind
*18:11.700- 18:19.040* :  the government that is calling for Hamas to be wiped out calling for a ground incursion into Gaza
*18:19.040- 18:26.840* :  as soon as possible I understand that that's not your thought it's absolutely not my thought for
*18:26.840- 18:33.960* :  several reasons first of all the consequences growing into a ground assault means that the Israeli
*18:33.960- 18:40.720* :  government has given up hope on the rest of the on the hostages and the the risk that this
*18:40.720- 18:48.280* :  would put on their lives that are already at risk constant risk is immense we have no clue what
*18:48.280- 18:56.460* :  would Hamas do if the ground incurring takes place and I wish that when Prime Minister Sunak
*18:56.460- 19:03.200* :  who is very kind to come and show his standing with Israel and we're very appreciative of them
*19:03.680- 19:09.540* :  but I really wish that when he and Netanyahu stood in front of the camera and Netanyahu said
*19:09.540- 19:17.920* :  we want a win and Sunak said yes I want you to win I truly hope that in private he asked Netanyahu
*19:18.220- 19:25.460* :  what's a win because I feel that at this point what Israel needs is not a victory we need hope
*19:25.460- 19:32.300* :  these are the darkest times in Israel people are desperate they're enraged they're hurt
*19:32.300- 19:40.660* :  and what we need is hope and bringing back the 200 hostages saving 200 people that are we're
*19:40.660- 19:45.320* :  talking about infants we're talking about pregnant women we're talking about the elderly we're
*19:45.320- 19:51.240* :  talking about the elderly caretakers who are foreigners have nothing to do with this conflict
*19:52.000- 20:00.020* :  bringing them back home saving their lives preventing 200 more tragedies from happening this is
*20:00.020- 20:07.560* :  the kind of hope we need this is what would start turning the things around and the what has to
*20:07.560- 20:13.580* :  happen in order for this to take place is to stop the fighting immediately the Israeli politicians
*20:13.580- 20:21.620* :  are talking about bringing back the hostages I want to see them act when you make that call
*20:21.620- 20:27.900* :  for a ceasefire perhaps even in conversation with friends how do people react to you within Israel
*20:28.440- 20:35.360* :  it really depends I've seen people who are sworn peaceniks and leftists calling out for
*20:36.160- 20:43.160* :  unbelievable violence the call for revenge is natural I expect politicians to think rationally
*20:43.160- 20:52.080* :  and constantly think what is Israel's interests and if we are as president Biden put it if the value
*20:52.080- 20:58.740* :  that we put on human life and human dignity that's what makes us who we are and that's what sets us
*20:58.740- 21:04.320* :  apart for Hamas Hamas is proven that they have complete this regard for Palestinian lives in
*21:04.320- 21:10.820* :  Israeli lives if that's what sets us apart we need to prove it not just talk about it Udi Gorin
*21:13.900- 21:21.120* :  still to come a famous footballer turns singer what kind of performer are you on stage a great performer

*22:05.500- 22:10.080* :  stories from around the world in the happy pod available in this feed every Saturday
*22:18.700- 22:23.660* :  welcome back to the global news podcast let's go to Kenya now we're a panic and tragic
*22:23.660- 22:28.980* :  confusion outside a stadium in the west led to a crush which killed four people it's thought
*22:28.980- 22:34.380* :  that people in a crowd mistook steam from tea that had been spilled for tear gas as well as the
*22:34.380- 22:39.960* :  dead 13 people were injured the venue was hosting national day celebrations as Rachel Wright reports
*22:40.620- 22:45.160* :  thousands of people had arrived in the small town of Carichou to take part in the celebrations
*22:45.160- 22:51.860* :  for Kenya's mishuja or heroes day they began to enter the stadium around 1am but local police said
*22:51.860- 22:56.980* :  the crowd panicked when a storeholder spilled tea outside one of the entry gates and the steam
*22:56.980- 23:02.520* :  was mistaken for tear gas despite the casualties the celebrations went ahead as planned and were
*23:02.520- 23:07.720* :  led by the Kenyan president William Ruto when he arrived later in the morning the police said they
*23:07.720- 23:12.920* :  were conducting an investigation into the incident let's go now to Italy where the prime minister
*23:12.920- 23:18.680* :  is splitting up with her long-term partner Georgi Malone and Andrea Giambruno have been together
*23:18.680- 23:24.860* :  for 10 years a couple have daughter but recordings emerge this week which seem to include Mr
*23:24.860- 23:29.800* :  Giambruno talking about in a fair that he'd had and also trying to use his position as a TV
*23:29.800- 23:36.180* :  presenter to gain sexual favors are Europe regional editor Paul Moss gave this update you know
*23:36.180- 23:39.940* :  Robin you've got to hand it to the Italians haven't you I mean you just get a better class of
*23:39.940- 23:44.940* :  sexual scandal in other countries the politicians and their partners get caught in embarrassing
*23:44.960- 23:49.560* :  situations Italy from the ancient Romans through to Silvio Balasconi it's always a bit more
*23:50.180- 23:54.760* :  over the top to understand this affair what you've got to remember is Georgi Malone has
*23:54.760- 24:01.480* :  been a champion of family values she's opposed to some aspects of LGBT rights she's clamped
*24:01.480- 24:07.680* :  down even on surrogate parenthood so it's always been rather pointed that she herself is a single
*24:07.680- 24:14.460* :  mother she never married the father of her child Andrea Giambruno maybe maybe we now have a clue why
*24:14.580- 24:19.720* :  these recordings made were made off air at the TV station where he works he makes some very
*24:19.720- 24:25.960* :  flotatious remarks indeed to female colleagues it sounds like he had an affair and he also seems
*24:25.960- 24:31.120* :  to suggest to women they could work on his team if they had group sex with him now bear in mind
*24:31.120- 24:36.780* :  he works for a television station owned by the Balasconi family echoes there of Silvio Balasconi
*24:36.780- 24:41.920* :  and his infamous Bunga Bunga parties much more seriously to some though remarks made by Mr
*24:41.920- 24:47.480* :  Giambruno last August there'd been an appalling gang rape and he said if you avoid getting drunk
*24:47.480- 24:53.160* :  and losing your senses you might also avoid running into certain problems and coming across a
*24:53.160- 24:58.580* :  wolf it sounded to many like he was blaming the victim for being raped Georgi Malone at the time
*24:58.580- 25:03.540* :  distanced herself from those remarks but now it seems these these new recordings with a final straw
*25:04.140- 25:07.940* :  okay just very quickly one word is she in trouble or is this going to be to her benefit
*25:08.360- 25:13.200* :  I think in the end it most Italians are focused on immigration that is the big issue whether
*25:13.200- 25:17.560* :  she can sort that out what her former partner may or may not have got up to less of a concern
*25:18.260- 25:22.820* :  Paul Moss reporting politics now here in the UK with potentially serious repercussions
*25:23.460- 25:28.380* :  because the governing conservative party has had an awful 24 hours and the early hours of
*25:28.380- 25:33.440* :  Friday it lost two of its safest seats in parliament there were only elections in those small
*25:33.440- 25:38.740* :  areas but it is the strongest sign yet that after 13 years in power the party could be heading
*25:38.740- 25:43.120* :  forward defeat in a general election that's due to be called by the end of next year
*25:43.180- 25:49.220* :  the main opposition labor party overturned a huge majority in both seats so how important are
*25:49.220- 25:53.480* :  these by-elections it was a question that I put to our political correspondent Rob Watson
*25:53.960- 25:58.960* :  well I think they're very significant although it's absolutely true turn out tends to be low at
*25:58.960- 26:03.740* :  these by-elections and they're often used to give the party and power a kicking if you look at
*26:03.740- 26:08.120* :  however how these by-elections compared to other ones since the second world or in other words
*26:08.120- 26:14.720* :  you compare light with light robin these are historically truly terrible and compare only really
*26:14.720- 26:21.040* :  to the kind of defeat suffered by the conservatives under John Major before between 1992 and 2007
*26:21.040- 26:26.460* :  and of course before the Labour landslide under Tony Blair I mean the numbers on this are staggering
*26:26.460- 26:31.060* :  aren't they and you know the experts they drill down on the numbers and they are only local elections
*26:31.060- 26:35.440* :  but it was a staggering swing wasn't it away from the ruling conservatives towards the main
*26:35.440- 26:40.440* :  opposition labor party absolutely and to tie all to that together it's worth remembering Robyn
*26:40.440- 26:46.180* :  that for the for Labour to beat the conservatives at the next election they need a massive swing
*26:46.180- 26:52.180* :  of support of nearly 10 percent well these by-elections they saw swings of over 20 percent
*26:52.680- 26:57.140* :  and worth remember Labour is consistently ahead of the conservatives in the polling by between
*26:57.140- 27:02.840* :  sort of 15 and 20 percent now of course the conservatives point out that Sir Keir Starmer the
*27:02.840- 27:07.100* :  Labour leader he isn't as popular as Tony Blair which is true and that there's still time
*27:07.100- 27:11.940* :  before the next election but again it's really worth remembering Robyn no governing party
*27:11.940- 27:16.900* :  has recovered from being this far behind in the polls since the second world war so unless
*27:16.900- 27:23.220* :  something pretty dramatic turns up the conservatives could be facing electoral Armageddon as one
*27:23.220- 27:29.340* :  of the senior politicians put it Rob Watson reporting now get ready to hear about an immense period
*27:29.740- 27:34.840* :  and some very very large distances travelled because astronomers have detected the most
*27:34.840- 27:41.140* :  distant fast radio burst or FRB to date it was discovered by a team in Australia they were using
*27:41.140- 27:46.360* :  a radio telescope Terry Egan has more on what the burst is and why we're talking about it
*27:46.760- 27:52.880* :  a blast of radio waves lasting less than a millisecond and from so far away its light took
*27:52.880- 28:00.880* :  8 billion years to reach us this FRB is one of the most energetic ever observed in that fraction
*28:00.880- 28:09.200* :  of a second it released the equivalent of our sons total emissions over 30 years often much brighter
*28:09.200- 28:15.500* :  than the galaxies they come from FRBs disappear so quickly that they can be hard to detect
*28:15.500- 28:22.700* :  so it's a moment to celebrate still it's not easy to know what they are the scientists think
*28:22.700- 28:28.840* :  this one at the very limit of how far back astronomers can currently see comes from several
*28:28.840- 28:35.720* :  galaxies merging together but it could give us a new method to weigh up the universe current
*28:35.720- 28:42.620* :  methods of estimating its mass give contradictory answers and challenge the standard model of cosmology
*28:43.260- 28:49.340* :  more than half the matter that should be there appears to be missing scientists say it could be
*28:49.340- 28:56.060* :  located in areas in between galaxies but is so hot and diffuse it can't be seen
*28:56.860- 29:04.100* :  FRBs such as this one could perhaps be used to measure what seems not to be there
*29:05.040- 29:10.120* :  right let's end this global news podcast on a famous footballer turned poet turned actor
*29:10.500- 29:15.940* :  turned he hopes singer Eric Canton was one of the most talented footballers of his generation
*29:16.340- 29:21.180* :  then he grew a beard and he turned his hand to other things now it's time for Eric Canton art the
*29:21.180- 29:27.000* :  singer apparently next week the former Manchester United legend inbox on his first ever tour of the UK
*29:27.000- 29:32.620* :  which includes a song that he wrote which he says was inspired by that infamous karate kick attack
*29:33.040- 29:37.600* :  on a spectator during a game our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson went to meet him
*29:41.620- 29:47.200* :  this is your first ever UK tour what kind of performer are you on stage a great performer
*29:51.500- 29:53.440* :  of course you know that
*29:53.760- 29:58.520* :  in general I've been selfish I've been mad
*30:03.180- 30:08.820* :  during the six seasons in English football cantona won the league five times and the FA Cup twice
*30:11.900- 30:18.100* :  fans chanted his name but now he's the one doing the singing watch yourself in the mirror
*30:18.100- 30:29.860* :  so many so many Eric cantona this singer how long has this been a dream of yours when I was a kid
*30:29.860- 30:37.840* :  yeah when I was a kid I had two passion it was art and sports football so I started by your football
*30:38.320- 30:46.540* :  it's better I think I have a cheap need of expressing myself so when I stopped football I started to
*30:46.900- 30:52.580* :  act including Ken Loach's film looking for Eric it's funny isn't it sometimes we forget
*30:52.580- 31:03.320* :  are you just a man I'm not a man I am cantona and then the lockdown on my phone arrived and then I

*31:10.380- 31:14.260* :  write the song but good enough to write songs with my guitar
*31:23.420- 31:29.760* :  and when it comes to writing you do the lyrics and you do the music yeah I feel of
*31:29.800- 31:35.680* :  also more comfortable in French because it's my language but English is very musical language
*31:36.560- 31:45.720* :  French not so music and just like with his football career cantona is taking on the music industry
*31:45.720- 31:52.840* :  in his own way no starting out as a support act for him oh no but me I'm a designer you will
*31:52.840- 31:57.800* :  always be the headliner of course you would never support anyone maybe the stunts can't
