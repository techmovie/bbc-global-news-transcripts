*00:48.980- 00:55.080* :  This is the Global News podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the
*00:55.080- 01:01.240* :  early hours of Thursday, the 7th of December, these are our main stories. In a highly unusual move,
*01:01.240- 01:07.000* :  the UN Secretary General invokes an article of the UN charter to urge the Security Council
*01:07.000- 01:12.960* :  to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. President Biden asks Republicans to approve funding for
*01:12.960- 01:17.920* :  Ukraine's war effort urging compromise. Republicans think they get everything they want
*01:18.840- 01:22.440* :  without any bipartisan compromise. That's not the answer.
*01:23.060- 01:30.540* :  Also, when I first came to Indonesia, I had two children. When the locals pushed back the
*01:30.540- 01:38.000* :  boo, one of my children died. The misery of Rohingya refugees who fled from Bangladesh to Indonesia.
*01:40.400- 01:45.760* :  Also this podcast, just recently we found where they are. There's a small area where we walk
*01:45.760- 01:51.180* :  in and that's it. We don't have any other reports of them anywhere. The giant pangolins
*01:51.180- 01:57.060* :  discovered in Kenya and the plans to protect them. Plus, the singer Taylor Swift is named
*01:57.060- 02:06.840* :  as Time Magazine's Person of the Year. In a highly unusual move, the UN Secretary General
*02:06.840- 02:13.400* :  Antonio Guterres has tried to ensure the deteriorating situation in Gaza is discussed as soon
*02:13.400- 02:18.780* :  as possible by the Security Council. In a letter to members of the Council, Mr. Guterres
*02:18.780- 02:24.220* :  warned of a collapse of the humanitarian system in the territory. He again stressed the urgent
*02:24.220- 02:29.400* :  need for a ceasefire, warning of potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians
*02:29.400- 02:35.140* :  and for the security in the whole region. At a news briefing in New York, his spokesman Stefan
*02:35.140- 02:40.600* :  Tajaric said that the Secretary General had taken the rare step of invoking an article
*02:40.600- 02:45.900* :  of the UN Charter. This is the first time that Antonio Guterres has done this since he became
*02:45.900- 02:52.940* :  Secretary General in 2017. Article 99 states and I quote that the Secretary General may bring
*02:52.940- 02:58.100* :  to the attention of the Security Council any matter in his opinion that may threaten the
*02:58.100- 03:03.260* :  maintenance of international peace and security. In the letter which has been shared with you,
*03:03.260- 03:09.160* :  the Secretary General, urges the members of the Security Council to press to avert a humanitarian
*03:09.160- 03:14.100* :  catastrophe and he appeals for a humanitarian ceasefire to be declared.
*03:14.580- 03:19.640* :  On Wednesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his forces were surrounding
*03:19.640- 03:25.220* :  the House of a top Hamas leader, saying he could flee, but it was only a matter of time
*03:25.220- 03:29.760* :  until he was found. He also pressed the Red Cross to visit Israeli hostages,
*03:29.760- 03:34.260* :  held in Gaza. A correspondent Yuga Bachega reports now from Jerusalem.
*03:37.300- 03:41.860* :  House to House fighting in Gaza. In the north, there's been intense bombardment
*03:41.860- 03:47.780* :  of the Jabbalya refugee camp. To the south, airstrikes have continued to hit Hanyunis,
*03:48.300- 03:54.420* :  and Israeli tanks are said to be encircling the House of the top Hamas leader, Yakhni Asim War.
*03:55.980- 04:01.940* :  At the city's Nasa Hospital, the staff are unable to treat everyone. This is Dr. Muhammad Candil.
*04:11.820- 04:17.760* :  Israeli military says its attacks are precise and that it is taking steps to protect the population.
*04:18.420- 04:24.920* :  But today, the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees was unequivocal. It said it had seen no
*04:24.920- 04:31.020* :  recalibration of the country's tactics, describing a pattern of attacks, targeting or impacting
*04:31.020- 04:36.780* :  civilian infrastructure. Lin Hastings is the UN's humanitarian coordinator in the Palestinian
*04:36.780- 04:43.020* :  territories. She's being expelled from Israel. Gaza is just not safe. There is nowhere to go. They
*04:43.020- 04:48.880* :  are literally being chased from corner to corner by the Israelis. We're looking at 1.5 million
*04:48.880- 04:55.440* :  people being displaced. The scale of destruction, I don't know if that will ever be able to be
*04:55.440- 05:00.620* :  repaired. The Israeli authorities earned a pressure at home too, from the families of the
*05:00.620- 05:06.240* :  hostages who remain in Gaza. They say they've received solid intelligence that some captives
*05:06.240- 05:10.640* :  aren't risk of dying. The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
*05:10.640- 05:17.400* :  Mediana Spaliaric, who visited Gaza on Monday, has responded to criticism of their role in
*05:17.400- 05:22.820* :  facilitating the release of Israeli hostages. In a moment we'll hear more about that, but first,
*05:22.820- 05:28.020* :  James Menendez started by asking her what she saw on her trip to Gaza.
*05:28.380- 05:33.900* :  The humanitarian situation in Gaza is devastating. The situation in the hospital where it was
*05:33.900- 05:41.360* :  shocking. Surgeons are exhausted. I saw many people, and with the trotchless wounds, I saw
*05:41.360- 05:48.380* :  children that were visibly malnourished and probably starving. We have very limited mobility,
*05:48.400- 05:55.360* :  but whenever we can, we deliver fuel, deliver water, deliver medicine. A lot of the surgeries
*05:55.360- 06:01.820* :  are being conducted without anesthesia, so this is a big priority for us, but we need a predictable
*06:01.820- 06:08.720* :  flow of medical assistance. We are committed to stay. We are not leaving. We need to de-escalate.
*06:08.720- 06:14.160* :  We need to see an operating space that allows us to move from A to B.
*06:14.380- 06:19.060* :  Can I ask you about the hostages? Are the Israeli Foreign Minister said that he expected the
*06:19.060- 06:24.320* :  Red Cross to put the issue at the top of its priority list? Is it at the top of that priority list?
*06:24.680- 06:30.280* :  It is at the very top of our priority list, including my own. On the current circumstances,
*06:30.280- 06:36.500* :  this is not only difficult, but also very dangerous for the hostages themselves. Access
*06:36.500- 06:42.560* :  to hostages requires an agreement between the parties on how we would implement that when
*06:42.560- 06:47.980* :  it happens, and that agreement is lacking at the moment. So we are talking to both sides to make
*06:47.980- 06:55.520* :  sure that they allow us to go without endangering the hostages themselves. Everybody has to agree
*06:55.520- 07:00.820* :  on how this access is going to be implemented. Why can't you imagine that Israel would hold up
*07:01.140- 07:05.400* :  Red Cross access to the hostages? So it's really up to Hamas to give you that access, isn't it?
*07:05.600- 07:11.500* :  We are demanding that Hamas gives us access. This requires two sides. We are not commenting
*07:11.500- 07:17.320* :  because we are not part of these negotiations, and we cannot be as a neutral actor,
*07:17.320- 07:20.880* :  but we want to implement it. There has been this phrase that's gained some
*07:20.880- 07:26.440* :  traction on social media in Israel describing the ICRC as a mere uber service for the hostages.
*07:26.440- 07:30.060* :  In other words, those who have been released just putting them in vehicles and getting them out
*07:30.060- 07:36.400* :  of Gaza. What's your response to that? This is profoundly unjust, unfair, and it's wrong.
*07:36.660- 07:43.760* :  These operations are extremely complex. They require a very close cooperation, especially also
*07:43.760- 07:50.140* :  with the Israeli side, and they know what it takes to implement these releases. We are working
*07:50.140- 07:55.980* :  around the clock with the authorities on the Israeli side to make them possible whenever there
*07:55.980- 08:01.220* :  is an agreement to release hostages. The president of the ICRC, Mayana Svalyarech,
*08:01.220- 08:06.940* :  speaking there to James Menendez. President Biden has urged Republican congressmen and women
*08:06.940- 08:13.380* :  to approve a multi-billion dollar assistance package for Ukraine. In return for Republican support,
*08:13.380- 08:19.220* :  Mr. Biden said he could compromise over their demands for tougher measures against migrants
*08:19.220- 08:25.440* :  on the U.S.-Mexico border. This has to be a negotiation. The Republicans think they get everything
*08:25.440- 08:31.500* :  they want without any bipartisan compromise. That's not the answer. Another will need to
*08:31.500- 08:37.040* :  literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield and damage our national security in the process.
*08:37.760- 08:41.760* :  The White House has warned that U.S. funds for Ukraine could soon run out.
*08:41.760- 08:46.760* :  The U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said it was vital to reach a deal with
*08:46.760- 08:52.520* :  those Republicans who opposed to further military aid for Ukraine. We have nearly exhausted
*08:52.520- 08:58.020* :  the available security assistance that is available to Ukraine. It is urgent that Congress act,
*08:58.360- 09:02.920* :  especially as we enter this difficult winter, when we know we will see increased Russian
*09:02.920- 09:08.680* :  attacks. With more details, here's Nomea Iqbal in Washington. President Biden's warning to
*09:08.680- 09:13.500* :  Congress is stark. He said if President Putin wins, he won't stop there, and that American
*09:13.500- 09:19.020* :  troops could be dragged into a future war. The appetite to support Kiev is fading, especially
*09:19.020- 09:24.300* :  amongst many Republicans. Since the war began, Congress has directed more than $110 billion
*09:24.300- 09:29.660* :  to Ukraine in military humanitarian and financial assistance. Republicans say there needs to be a
*09:29.660- 09:35.340* :  better strategy to justify spending American taxpayers' money. They're due to vote on sending
*09:35.340- 09:40.820* :  $61 billion to Ukraine, but it's part of a larger national security package, and Republicans
*09:40.820- 09:45.300* :  want to add border security policy changes to it, which has stalled the funding.
*09:45.920- 09:52.080* :  Nomea Iqbal, more than 1,000 Rohingya Muslims have sought refuge in the Indonesian province of
*09:52.080- 09:58.500* :  Aceh after perilous days spent in rickety boats at sea. They become refugees for a second time,
*09:58.500- 10:04.020* :  after initially fleeing violence in Myanmar, to neighbouring Bangladesh. But in our say,
*10:04.020- 10:09.380* :  conditions in the refugee camps at Cox's Bazaar have become increasingly unbearable.
*10:09.960- 10:16.360* :  As BBC Indonesia's Hannah Samusia reports from Aceh, tensions with local people have been rising.
*10:17.140- 10:20.160* :  Warning that parts of her report are distressing.
*10:22.360- 10:27.680* :  A group of angry residents blocks a boat carrying more than 200 Rohingya refugees.
*10:28.400- 10:33.180* :  You cannot dock here, they tell them, and stop the passengers from reaching the shore.
*10:33.920- 10:39.260* :  Yasmin Fatou and her two young children were among those on board. She, like her fellow
*10:39.260- 10:45.220* :  passengers, set sail from the refugee camps in Bangladesh, Cox's Bazaar, in search of better
*10:45.220- 10:53.020* :  lives in Indonesia. The 25-year-old spent days at sea in dire conditions, with threat of disease
*10:53.020- 11:01.380* :  and a lack of food. When I first came to Indonesia, I had to children. When the locals pushed back the
*11:01.380- 11:08.120* :  boat, one of my children died on the boat. I didn't have any water, so I gave salty water to my baby.
*11:08.700- 11:14.500* :  Her condition worsened, and she died. We couldn't do anything, so we threw her into the sea.
*11:15.180- 11:19.800* :  After being pushed away twice and waiting for several days in the water,
*11:19.800- 11:26.240* :  the flimsy vessel was finally allowed to dock. Yasmin and her son, along with other refugees,
*11:26.240- 11:28.580* :  were brought to an old government building.
*11:30.320- 11:36.820* :  Here, tens of people are squeezed into one room. Some of them are sick, but they have no choice.
*11:37.980- 11:42.520* :  Over a thousand Rohingya refugees have arrived in Ache in the last month alone,
*11:42.560- 11:48.000* :  making their journey in six overlaiden boats. More than half of them are children.
*11:49.520- 11:54.420* :  On the same boat as Yasmin is Rohi Makatoum. Despite having a disability,
*11:54.960- 11:58.360* :  she was determined to flee from Cox's Bazaar with her sons.
*12:00.860- 12:04.860* :  We had a lot of terrorist in the camp. The threatened to kill our children,
*12:04.860- 12:10.040* :  clapped our mothers and daughters, and robbed us. They took my child and asked for money,
*12:10.040- 12:16.280* :  or they threatened to kill him. They already killed one of my children, and dumped his body in the ditch.
*12:18.220- 12:21.280* :  The Indonesian government, through a presidential decree,
*12:21.280- 12:26.420* :  said it would collaborate with institutions such as the United Nations and other
*12:26.420- 12:31.540* :  international organizations to handle arrivals. But the countries foreign ministry
*12:31.540- 12:37.200* :  also said that Indonesian goodwill in providing shelters had been exploited by human trafficking
*12:37.200- 12:43.720* :  networks. In the overcrowded shelter, Yasmin is still grieving for the loss of her infant daughter.
*12:45.360- 12:49.160* :  When I came here, I hoped that the residents would accept us.
*12:49.980- 12:54.500* :  I want to pray to God to get a bigger place, because this place is not enough for everyone.
*12:57.680- 13:02.840* :  Yasmin ending that report from BBC Indonesia's Hannah Samasier in Ache.
*13:03.700- 13:08.440* :  African pangolins are one of the world's most trafficked mammals. Their scales are in high
*13:08.440- 13:13.280* :  demand in traditional Chinese medicine. They were thought to be extinct in Kenya,
*13:13.700- 13:19.040* :  but a team of conservationists discovered giant ones. Now the conservationists are working with
*13:19.040- 13:25.100* :  the local community to increase pangolin numbers and to help protect them. Victoria Awanhonda
*13:25.100- 13:30.240* :  spoke to Berel Macquarie, who is the program manager for the Pangolin project, and she asked
*13:30.240- 13:38.440* :  when pangolins were last seen in Kenya. Very many years ago, maybe 70s. Wow. There was just one record
*13:38.440- 13:45.020* :  around the Victoria business and that's it. So back in the 70s will be the last record that
*13:45.020- 13:50.080* :  they were seeing, the giant ground pangolins. Why did their numbers shrink?
*13:50.180- 13:55.000* :  Just recently we found where they are. There's a small area where we're working and that's it.
*13:55.000- 13:59.840* :  We don't have any other records of them anywhere. So they are shrinking numbers, maybe attributed to the
*13:59.860- 14:06.320* :  many threats that they face, which is mostly electric fences that are killing lots and lots of them,
*14:06.580- 14:11.780* :  and then habitat loss and then poaching. We just started working on this population
*14:11.900- 14:17.320* :  a year and a few months plus. So we are not yet talking about bringing the population to where
*14:17.320- 14:22.760* :  we would like it to be. We just beginning to eliminate threats and make sure the population isn't
*14:22.760- 14:28.440* :  doing was like reduce the numbers that are dying on electric fences and make sure their habitat
*14:28.440- 14:33.400* :  is safe. Before now, we can start saying we've increased the numbers from this number to now
*14:33.400- 14:39.400* :  this one. So how many do you have now? We are looking at between 30 and 80 giant ground pangolins
*14:39.420- 14:43.180* :  in the whole of Kenya. How much would you like to see them grow to?
*14:43.500- 14:48.200* :  Oh, we are hoping for 200 and above in that small area and hoping that there is also another
*14:48.200- 14:52.840* :  population, another small pockets of forest is just that they have not been confirmed but we are
*14:52.840- 14:57.940* :  hoping they should be there. And how are you bringing in the local communities in your quest to
*14:57.940- 15:03.280* :  try and bring these numbers up? So the problem in this area is that the area was subdivided and then
*15:03.280- 15:08.880* :  they are it has experienced 80% of forest loss and that means everyone is now demarcating their
*15:08.880- 15:14.000* :  land. So we are working with this land on us to remove electricity on the lowest trans of
*15:14.000- 15:18.500* :  their fences so that pangolins can pass through safe because that's one of their major threats.
*15:18.500- 15:23.380* :  We lose two every month from electric fences and then secondly we are working with them
*15:23.380- 15:29.480* :  to secure habitat so they can lease their land for conservation away from agriculture and farms
*15:29.480- 15:34.400* :  and now lease their land for conservation so that we'll have a secure habitat not just for pangolins
*15:34.400- 15:39.660* :  for every other biodiverse. One win that we have in this area is that the land on us are already
*15:39.660- 15:45.400* :  willing to be part of conservation. Beryl McCory speaking there to Victoria Awanhanda.
*15:46.440- 15:52.620* :  Time magazine has named the American singer Taylor Swift as its person of the year for 2023.
*15:53.500- 15:57.520* :  Mark Savage is our culture correspondent and I asked him why now?
*16:00.180- 16:06.820* :  Taylor Swift has been famous for a very long time but something shifted in 2023 partly because of
*16:06.820- 16:12.140* :  this massive tour that she's done in both North and South America. Her era is tour where she has
*16:12.960- 16:18.180* :  deliberately gone back and revisited every single album that she's released up until now.
*16:22.640- 16:28.660* :  It's a career spanning tour. It comes six years after she was last able to tour and in that time
*16:28.660- 16:35.320* :  she put out multiple albums, some of which are considered her most artistically valid records of all.
*16:39.580- 16:44.740* :  So there was this huge pent up appetite to see her when the tickets went on sale,
*16:44.740- 16:50.400* :  the ticketmaster website fell apart and the owners of that business were called into the US
*16:50.400- 16:56.040* :  senate to explain what had gone wrong. When the tour went to cities around the US people who
*16:56.040- 17:01.140* :  couldn't get tickets congregated in the car parks, thousands of them to listen to the songs.
*17:01.940- 17:07.140* :  And there is just this cultural weight that she has carried through the pandemic into the
*17:07.140- 17:14.620* :  real world of concerts in 2023. She is I think the only one to feature solo a musician on the front
*17:14.620- 17:19.240* :  cover of time as person of the year. So what makes her so special? It's one of those things in
*17:19.240- 17:26.460* :  pop music. Everybody has what's called an imperial phase. Madonna had won in the 80s Lady Gaga had won
*17:26.460- 17:33.620* :  about 15 years ago and Taylor Swift is just at that crest of the wave right now. She has been
*17:33.620- 17:40.660* :  big before on albums like Fearless and 1989 where she graduated to becoming a stadium pop star
*17:40.660- 17:44.960* :  where people were paying attention to what she said. But then she had a bit of a fall. There was
*17:44.960- 17:52.060* :  this period maybe seven years ago where there were accusations that her brand of feminism was not the
*17:52.060- 17:58.400* :  right sort of feminism, whatever that means. She was also under attack from other pop stars very
*17:58.400- 18:05.700* :  famously Kanye West used Taylor Swift in ways that are borderline despicable putting naked images of
*18:05.700- 18:11.680* :  her in his music videos, taunting her at award shows. And then she lost all the rights to her
*18:11.680- 18:17.380* :  master tips. But she picked herself up. During the pandemic she recorded these two albums of beautiful
*18:17.500- 18:24.940* :  folklore inspired indie music called Folklore and Evermore that won her a third Grammy for album
*18:24.940- 18:44.020* :  of the year. And then she carried that momentum through out of the pandemic making more pop music,
*18:44.460- 18:51.080* :  making more albums, making statements that endeared her to her fans and building up a very intimate
*18:51.080- 19:08.080* :  relationship with her fans which is something she has been a master of. Mark Savage on Taylor
*19:08.080- 19:16.300* :  Swift who is Time magazine's person of the year. Still to come on the Global News podcast.
*19:16.920- 19:22.660* :  China says it's about mutually beneficial relations but critics say it's a form of influence
*19:22.660- 19:27.380* :  and sees it traps countries in debt and then it tries to extract political concessions, military
*19:27.380- 19:34.880* :  concessions. Is this why Italy has pulled out of China's Belt and Road initiative? Stay tuned to find out.
*19:41.460- 19:46.300* :  Let's return now to our top story. Israel's Foreign Minister says the
*19:46.300- 19:53.240* :  UN Secretary-General's tenure is a danger to world peace. Ilay Kohn was reacting to the decision
*19:53.240- 20:00.720* :  by Antonio Guterres to invoke Article 99 of the UN Charter. Earlier at the Israeli ambassador to
*20:00.720- 20:06.900* :  the UN called it a new moral law. A correspondent in New York Net Atophic told me more about the
*20:06.900- 20:12.920* :  significance of the Secretary-General's action. By their own admission it's quite a dramatic move
*20:12.920- 20:19.040* :  and certainly one that's meant to send a clear message to the Security Council that the secretary
*20:19.040- 20:24.800* :  general is frustrated with them and is trying to remind them of their responsibilities.
*20:25.440- 20:31.480* :  This is the first time that Antonio Guterres has ever invoked Article 99 which essentially
*20:31.580- 20:38.600* :  gives him the power to bring to the attention of the Security Council matters that he thinks are
*20:38.600- 20:43.500* :  of a grave threat to the maintenance of international peace and security. I mean it's been several
*20:43.500- 20:49.840* :  decades since it's been invoked. It's only been invoked a handful of times by other Secretary
*20:49.840- 20:56.920* :  generals in the past and now you have this perhaps the most powerful distress signal coming from
*20:56.920- 21:03.560* :  the Secretary-General. Has there been any reactions so far? There has been, yes, Arab group ambassadors
*21:03.560- 21:08.940* :  at the United Nations got together. They have circulated a very short resolution which very
*21:08.940- 21:15.800* :  simply reiterates the Secretary-General's invoking of Article 99 and calls for AC's fire. They
*21:15.800- 21:20.880* :  have circulated that it's unclear though when there will be a vote. We know that several Arab
*21:20.880- 21:26.360* :  foreign ministers are meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday and remember
*21:26.360- 21:34.160* :  the United States as Israel's ally has posed. Another resolution has opposed calls for a cease
*21:34.180- 21:41.660* :  fire so we'll see what those discussions yield. We've also had reaction from the Israeli mission
*21:41.660- 21:49.920* :  which has reacted quite angrily to the Secretary-General's invoking of Article 99. They say that he
*21:49.920- 21:56.720* :  reached a new moral low with this and that he is again showing his moral distortion and his bias
*21:56.720- 22:03.280* :  against Israel. Neutrophic. Meanwhile, Israeli troops are involved in intense battles with Hamas
*22:03.280- 22:09.080* :  in the heart of Can Unis in southern Gaza. Evan Davis spoke to two people in Can Unis,
*22:09.300- 22:14.540* :  Mohammad Galeani and atmospheric scientists from England who was on holiday in Gaza when the
*22:14.540- 22:20.620* :  conflict started and is staying put and first to Akram, a translator, based in the city.
*22:39.360- 22:45.360* :  A drone that was firing and discriminated fire in distance of the refugee camp. Can Unis refugee
*22:45.360- 22:51.920* :  camp is in the most overcrowded area in whole Can Unis city and this firing was going on just 20
*22:51.920- 22:56.440* :  minutes ago. The bombardments are part of the daily routine and the displacement is already
*22:56.440- 23:01.400* :  becoming part of the daily routine of the people in Gaza. So I just want to be clear Akram. We know
*23:01.400- 23:08.460* :  drones have been flying overhead in surveillance. You say the drone was firing on the refugee camp?
*23:08.460- 23:13.860* :  Yes, the drone was firing in more than four different locations over the refugee camp in the
*23:13.860- 23:18.700* :  streets of the refugee camp and to the houses of the refugee camp. If I can just add some extra
*23:18.700- 23:25.180* :  context, we've heard many reports of low level drones that fire machine gun fire, positioning
*23:25.180- 23:29.880* :  themselves like building high and firing on people that move basically. So that's the context
*23:29.880- 23:33.500* :  because I think a lot of the drones that we've heard about are rocket drones. We know this is
*23:33.500- 23:39.980* :  like a machine gun in the air. Akram, it's been very striking talking to people in Gaza that there
*23:39.980- 23:46.200* :  is a defiance of not wanting to get out of Gaza and leave that piece of land with the sense that
*23:46.480- 23:52.220* :  you'd never get back in if you left. I wonder whether you find people are growing tired and thinking
*23:52.220- 23:58.100* :  I do just want to get out now. Is that happening? When you have 1.8 million people moving all together,
*23:58.260- 24:02.440* :  where would they be able to go? They asked the people to move from the north to the south and then now
*24:02.440- 24:06.960* :  you're asking people to move from the south to the very south and they understand that the last
*24:06.960- 24:12.900* :  tip would be asking them to move from Rafa Houches in the very south to Sinai. They say we stay on our
*24:12.900- 24:18.720* :  land and we consider that as part of the fight for the sake of staying on this land. That hasn't
*24:18.720- 24:24.800* :  changed or you think people are beginning to think I can't put up with this? No, no. According to
*24:24.800- 24:30.420* :  what I do, there are tens of thousands of people who are not willing to leave their homes, their
*24:30.420- 24:35.260* :  villages, their town, not even to leave their properties and there are many other people who are
*24:35.260- 24:39.780* :  understandably seeking safety. But the issue that makes things worse for those who are seeking
*24:39.780- 24:44.960* :  safety is that they might be also moving to the very south and Rafa and they would be killed
*24:45.340- 24:49.360* :  or they would be injured or the areas that they are staying in they would be bombarded.
*24:49.860- 24:57.300* :  Akram and Bahamad speaking to Evan Davis. When Italy joined China's belt and road initiative,
*24:57.300- 25:03.520* :  it was criticised by the US and others. Italy was the only major western nation to join the
*25:03.520- 25:09.320* :  infrastructure plan but it is now pulling out. The belt and road proposal was launched by China's
*25:09.320- 25:15.540* :  President Xi Jinping back in 2013 and its believed aims to invest a trillion dollars across Asia and
*25:15.540- 25:21.240* :  Europe. Our Europe Regional Editor Danny Eberhard told me more about why Italy signed up in the
*25:21.240- 25:27.660* :  first place. It joined under the former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte 2019. It was hoping for a big
*25:27.660- 25:34.160* :  boost to trade at the time. The Italian economy was quite stagnant. There was talk about historical
*25:34.160- 25:42.340* :  links Marco Polo and the maritime route of the medieval times and Italy was the only G7 nation to
*25:42.340- 25:47.220* :  sign up. There are other European nations that linked into Belt and Road but Italy was a coup
*25:47.220- 25:53.220* :  for China and for what is essentially its flagship foreign policy. Belt and Road has been going for
*25:53.220- 25:58.960* :  10 years. There's about 150 countries involved, Europe Asia as you mentioned but also Africa and
*25:58.960- 26:04.920* :  Latin America so it really is a global project and in essence it's about building land and sea
*26:04.920- 26:10.520* :  trade routes so a lot of it is to do with construction, investment and development of things like
*26:10.520- 26:15.840* :  roads, railways, tunnels, airports, bridges, that sort of thing but there's also cultural
*26:15.840- 26:22.380* :  elements, scientific elements so it's really bringing in a wider development. China says it's
*26:22.380- 26:28.720* :  about mutually beneficial relations but critics say it's a form of influence buying and they say
*26:28.720- 26:33.400* :  that what China does is it traps countries in debt and then it tries to extract concessions,
*26:33.400- 26:38.160* :  political concessions, military concessions, perhaps control over things like strategic ports,
*26:38.160- 26:43.360* :  that sort of thing. And is that why it was so divisive when Italy joined? Yes, I mean that was
*26:43.360- 26:48.000* :  something that the US was warning about in particular, they were warning about things like for example
*26:48.000- 26:53.760* :  trade partnerships with Italian companies that had sensitive technological data and that leaking
*26:53.760- 27:00.320* :  back to China, that sort of thing. So the Italian government under George Mellone said this whole
*27:00.320- 27:05.880* :  thing was a mistake and it's seen as trying to back out of it. So where does this leave the
*27:05.880- 27:10.860* :  Belt and Road initiative? Well Italy has played this graph carefully, they haven't done a massive
*27:10.860- 27:16.320* :  political statement, I presume that's based on allowing China to save face but it says that
*27:16.680- 27:21.000* :  China remains a very important trading partner for Italy, it's its 10th biggest export
*27:21.000- 27:25.640* :  partnership and so it still wants to keep excellent relations with China, it says.
*27:26.060- 27:32.120* :  Dany Abahad, federal and local authorities in India are investigating a prestigious private hospital
*27:32.120- 27:37.300* :  in Delhi that's accused of involvement in the sale of organs. The allegations were raised by
*27:37.300- 27:43.500* :  a British newspaper which said that a scam had targeted impoverished villagers from Myanmar.
*27:44.240- 27:49.160* :  Charles Haplan reports, India's Apollo hospitals is one of the world's biggest private hospital groups
*27:49.160- 27:54.260* :  with facilities across Asia. The London Daily Telegraph has now accused it of being embroiled
*27:54.260- 27:59.560* :  in the illicit sale of kidneys. Using undercover reporters, it said it had learned that poor
*27:59.560- 28:05.020* :  Burmese people were flown to India after being persuade to sell their organs to rich compatriots.
*28:05.460- 28:10.320* :  The operations were allegedly carried out at the Apollo hospital in the Delhi suburb of Sarita
*28:10.320- 28:15.740* :  Vihar. Apollo hospitals denies any willful complicity in what it calls shocking allegations,
*28:15.740- 28:21.040* :  it says it will also hold an investigation. Much of the alleged racket was said to have been
*28:21.040- 28:25.600* :  arranged through Apollo's Myanmar office which is said to have worked with agents to forge
*28:25.600- 28:30.760* :  family trees and marriage certificates to imply that the kidney donor and recipient were related.
*28:31.400- 28:35.300* :  In fact, said the Telegraph, in 80% of the cases they were unrelated.
*28:35.960- 28:41.360* :  Neither Myanmar nor India allow strangers to donate organs and the sale of organs is outlawed
*28:41.360- 28:47.820* :  in most of the world. Charles Haplan, born in Atlanta, Georgia to Ethiopian parents,
*28:47.820- 28:54.380* :  Armen Bahana is a singer-songwriter as well as a filmmaker and screenwriter. When he released his
*28:54.380- 29:00.780* :  debut album back in 2019, the track Janet went viral and Graylove featured on Atlanta,
*29:00.780- 29:07.320* :  a hit TV series about his hometowns Hip Hop scene. That same year, Bahana went to Ethiopia for the
*29:07.320- 29:13.820* :  first time. That trip inspired his highly anticipated new album, The Nomad Stream. He's been speaking
*29:13.820- 29:20.300* :  to the BBC. End of 2019, that's when I wanted to Ethiopia for the first time and I took my mom back
*29:20.420- 29:25.820* :  and she hadn't been back to the country in over 40 years. So that experience was really powerful,
*29:26.220- 29:35.500* :  kind of shook me. A couple months after that, the pandemic hit. So of course we have all this time
*29:35.500- 29:41.860* :  to ourselves to be thinking and reflecting and then I had a family member pass away. It felt like
*29:41.860- 29:48.580* :  this domino effect where everything was like leading to me doing a deep dive in terms of like my own
*29:48.580- 29:56.040* :  self, my culture where I'm from but also my family. Just accepting all that life has to give,
*29:56.040- 30:00.600* :  what my individual life has given me, that was the spark for the album.
*30:09.200- 30:14.300* :  The album is called Armen, The Nomad Stream. The Nomad is this character who's trying to bring
*30:14.300- 30:19.680* :  the sense of home with him. Wherever he goes, this character that has a foot in two different worlds.
*30:32.640- 30:38.400* :  How we open up the album is a song called Armen. It was like revisiting my childhood through a dream.
*30:38.400- 30:46.160* :  So you hear my mom knocking on the bedroom door while I'm playing music really loud. She's telling me
*30:52.240- 30:55.800* :  to turn it off. And then you hear me crank up the music a little more and try to drown her out
*30:56.080- 30:59.000* :  in that sort of fade into the album.
*31:07.680- 31:13.820* :  That for me was important because that is that's me. That's my life growing up. I live in a very
*31:13.820- 31:18.940* :  hypershot household but also an American household. I wanted to listen to American music and the music
*31:18.940- 31:27.320* :  I wanted to listen to be my own person and it's like both sides of that coin. That is who I am, you know.
*31:32.860- 31:36.640* :  We close the album with a song called Going Home.
*31:43.600- 31:49.360* :  If you listen to the song and you listen to older Ethiopian classics from like the 70s,
*31:49.580- 31:55.080* :  the old jazz songs, you can hear that kind of sound in my album. There's a throughline there
*31:55.080- 32:01.180* :  with some of the melodies. But also you hear auto tune and you hear things that feel like oh this is
*32:01.180- 32:06.820* :  you know this is now, this is present, this is my world. The lyrics of that song are I know right
*32:06.820- 32:11.420* :  now we're drenched in sorrow but the sun still gonna come out tomorrow. So you love me and go tell
*32:11.420- 32:13.840* :  your mama thank you thanks to the one that's a bum.
*32:28.300- 32:33.380* :  And then at the very end of that song you hear a voice, my grandmother's voice who wishes me well
*32:41.400- 32:45.360* :  on my journey. And that was Brahana's grandmother wishing him all the best as he explores his
*32:45.360- 32:51.220* :  personal journey and there's plenty more from Brahana just search online for BBC this is Africa
*32:51.680- 32:57.960* :  and you can hear a longer interview with him. And that's it from us for now but there'll be a new
*32:57.960- 33:03.340* :  edition of the global news podcast later. This edition was mixed by Philip Bull the producer was
*33:03.340- 33:08.600* :  Emma Joseph the editor is ever is Karen Martin. I'm Valerie Sanderson and until next time bye bye
