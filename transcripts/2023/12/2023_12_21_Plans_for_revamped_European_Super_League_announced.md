*01:25.300- 01:29.600* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is being recorded at 14 hours GMT on Thursday,
*01:29.600- 01:34.980* :  the 21st of December. Will the European football super league make a comeback after a court
*01:34.980- 01:40.640* :  rules that a ban on clubs joining is unlawful? Conditions in Sudan's Jazeera state are described
*01:40.640- 01:47.540* :  as catastrophic, prompting two aid agencies to halt operations. As Israel orders Palestinians to move
*01:47.540- 01:52.420* :  out of the way of the fighting in southern Gaza, we hear about one family's dangerous escape from
*01:52.420- 02:00.700* :  the north. Also in this podcast, protests in Argentina, but the president insists tough action
*02:00.700- 02:06.860* :  is needed to fix the economy. And when you need to be mentally strong, you need to take fast decisions.
*02:07.000- 02:12.220* :  You deal with high pressure, nerves and everything. You can transform that to the war.
*02:12.840- 02:16.700* :  The Ukrainian sport star is moved from the tennis court to the battlefield.
*02:21.720- 02:25.580* :  Two years ago, some of the biggest clubs in European football came together to form a new
*02:25.860- 02:30.700* :  super league. The backlash from fans, governing bodies and even world leaders was swift,
*02:30.700- 02:36.580* :  and the plan disintegrated. Now it could be revived after Europe's top court ruled that Uefa
*02:36.580- 02:41.200* :  and FIFA were wrong to try to block it. The firm behind the super league has already announced
*02:41.200- 02:47.280* :  plans for new European breakaway tournaments involving 64 men's teams and 32 women's teams.
*02:47.280- 02:51.820* :  Its CEO, Bert Reichart, said the ruling had opened the door to innovation.
*02:52.080- 02:56.980* :  It paves the way for the creation of a new, more exciting,
*02:56.980- 03:02.540* :  competition at European level in which clubs can determine their own future.
*03:03.460- 03:09.820* :  All within the existing European football family. So again, the strongest message
*03:09.820- 03:17.580* :  today goes out to the fans. Football is free. Our sports news correspondent Alex
*03:17.580- 03:23.680* :  Kapstik told us what the court's judgement could mean. This is a ruling from 15 judges at the European
*03:23.680- 03:29.020* :  court of justice. That's your top court. And they were asked to look at this by the backers of
*03:29.020- 03:35.160* :  the rebel super league, a company called A22. And having considered it for the past year or more
*03:35.160- 03:40.180* :  than that, actually, they have decided that FIFA and UEFA European football's governing body
*03:40.180- 03:45.360* :  and world football's governing body have been abusing their power that they were wrong to try and
*03:45.360- 03:50.520* :  block the European super league. They're threatened sanctions. They're threatened to kick clubs out
*03:50.520- 03:54.260* :  of competitions, their own competitions to band players, all that from playing international
*03:54.260- 03:59.160* :  football, all that sort of stuff. And the European court of justice has said they were wrong to do that.
*03:59.160- 04:06.600* :  They were violating EU competition law. So in effect, this opens the way or clears the way
*04:06.620- 04:14.200* :  for breakaway tournaments. The law will allow them to create these tournaments without being sanctioned
*04:14.200- 04:20.500* :  by FIFA and UEFA. As you said, there are plans for a new tournament, a different tournament
*04:20.500- 04:25.700* :  to the original European super league idea, which collapsed after what 48 hours or something.
*04:26.260- 04:31.740* :  That tournament involves 64 clubs, so it's bigger format. But yes, it's a blow, certainly,
*04:31.740- 04:37.260* :  to the authority of FIFA and to UEFA. Although they will claim, and UEFA has already done this
*04:37.260- 04:41.580* :  in their statements, that it didn't specifically, this judgement didn't specifically approve
*04:41.660- 04:46.640* :  of the super league. It just said that breakaway competition should be allowed.
*04:46.640- 04:53.080* :  Yeah, I mean, could this eventually lead to a shake-up of European football, given all the money involved?
*04:53.120- 04:57.180* :  I know fans have already said they don't want a breakaway super league.
*04:58.200- 05:02.820* :  Yeah, well, I think the fans were, especially here in the UK in the Premier League,
*05:02.820- 05:06.860* :  the fans were absolutely adamant. This should not happen, and it caused all sorts of issues
*05:06.860- 05:11.200* :  around grounds. I remember Chelsea's Stanford Bridge, there were almost riots because of this
*05:11.560- 05:16.320* :  announcement of the super league. As we heard, the six English clubs, Premier League clubs involved,
*05:16.320- 05:20.600* :  they decided very quickly that they would have no part of the super league. Another
*05:20.600- 05:24.480* :  is followed. The only two clubs remain of the original 12. The Spaniardist Giants,
*05:24.480- 05:30.940* :  Rail Madrid and Barcelona. So they're still involved. UEFA has tried to head this off in the
*05:30.940- 05:36.180* :  meantime by revamping the Champions League. That's a bigger format. That's 36 teams yet next year,
*05:36.180- 05:42.780* :  up from 32. More money will be spread around the clubs in Europe. And FIFA has also decided to
*05:42.780- 05:47.080* :  up its game as far as the clubs are concerned by introducing a much bigger club World Cup,
*05:47.080- 05:52.680* :  which will start next year. And Mike, this ruling has an impact on the way FIFA and UEFA
*05:52.680- 05:58.020* :  run all together. Well, there's, well, UEFA's recent statement saying they're very happy with the way
*05:58.020- 06:02.120* :  they've changed their rules to prevent any breakaways. And they say they are robust,
*06:02.120- 06:07.820* :  and that they do comply with European law. And they also talk about the football pyramid being
*06:07.820- 06:12.920* :  strong and has the supportable to stakeholders. And they don't see that changing anytime soon.
*06:12.920- 06:18.540* :  I'm sure this group A22 with Rail Madrid and Barcelona involved will have a view on that.
*06:18.540- 06:21.640* :  We'll have to wait for the details to give it a proper assessment.
*06:21.900- 06:24.140* :  Our sports news correspondent Alex Kapstik.
*06:24.920- 06:29.200* :  Since a new front opened up in the fighting between rival army factions in Sudan,
*06:29.200- 06:34.500* :  at least a quarter of a million people have fled the city of Wadmoudani and the wider Al Jazeera
*06:34.500- 06:40.060* :  state. The area had become something of a safe haven for people escaping previous battles
*06:40.060- 06:45.100* :  in the capital Khartoum. But now with the advance this week of the paramilitary rapid support
*06:45.100- 06:50.480* :  forces, it too is part of the war zone. And the World Food Programme has been forced to suspend
*06:50.480- 06:57.100* :  relief operations there. Lenny Kinzli is the spokesperson for the World Food Programme in Sudan.
*06:57.100- 07:05.980* :  She spoke to James Coppnell. So the situation is rather alarming. We have seen over 300,000
*07:05.980- 07:13.380* :  people flee mostly Wadmoudani, but other parts of Jazeera state. Many of them fleeing on foot.
*07:14.100- 07:21.100* :  As WFP, we had set up an operational hub there where we were regularly reaching around 800,000
*07:21.100- 07:29.380* :  people with food and nutrition assistance. And now we have been forced to pause some of those
*07:29.380- 07:37.660* :  food distributions in some locations, including in Wadmoudani because the insecurity is posing such
*07:37.660- 07:43.380* :  challenges to our operations. And we are extremely concerned on the impact of civilians,
*07:44.080- 07:52.260* :  and also rising food insecurity as Jazeera state is one of the highest agricultural producing
*07:52.260- 07:58.380* :  states in Sudan. Yeah, once held as a bread basket, not just for Sudan, but for the Arab world,
*07:58.860- 08:03.000* :  the agricultural schemes in Jazeera state. So this is going to have a short term impact then,
*08:03.000- 08:08.060* :  presumably in a long term one in terms of agricultural production and so on. If we start with
*08:08.060- 08:15.340* :  the short term, where are people going and now that they've left Wadmoudani? So most people are
*08:15.340- 08:23.280* :  fleeing to the east. So to send our state to Blue Nile, to Gadaraf, to Kassala, so further east,
*08:23.280- 08:32.480* :  but what is extremely concerning is how quickly the conflict was spread to Wadmoudani and the
*08:32.480- 08:37.620* :  concern that it could spread further into these areas where now people are for the second or
*08:37.620- 08:43.800* :  third time being displaced and seeking refuge once again. And what I'm hearing from my Sudanese
*08:43.800- 08:50.280* :  colleagues on the ground is that nobody feels safe anywhere in the country anymore because the
*08:50.280- 08:56.700* :  situation is devolving so rapidly. And how do you go about planning to bring aid to people,
*08:56.700- 09:01.040* :  actually getting aid to people when essentially people are moving in all sorts of directions on
*09:01.040- 09:07.380* :  foot or bicycles, any means they can. It's not as if you have a target population all in one area.
*09:07.800- 09:12.200* :  So it's going to be very hard to get food to everyone who needs it. Exactly. That is one of the
*09:12.200- 09:17.720* :  biggest challenges at the moment. After the conflict broke out, had setup operations in Jazeera state,
*09:17.740- 09:25.600* :  did extensive targeting and registering people to receive food assistance. And now what we're
*09:25.600- 09:32.360* :  trying to see is how many of those people we are able to re-identify in different locations and
*09:32.360- 09:38.600* :  how we can reach them, for example, in center state. We do have a hub also set up in Kassala. And
*09:38.600- 09:44.280* :  so that's exactly what we were trying to do is identify those populations and where they need help.
*09:44.280- 09:51.340* :  But again, this is another challenge to re-reconfigure operations when we had already had to do so
*09:51.340- 09:57.440* :  after the conflict broke out in cartoon. But we're doing so as quickly as we possibly can. Luckily
*09:57.440- 10:03.520* :  yesterday we heard from our partners on ground in one locality in Jazeera state that they were able
*10:03.520- 10:10.920* :  to carry out distributions for around 30,000 people in Jazeera. So these are small successes in what
*10:10.920- 10:15.620* :  is a very challenging situation. Lenny Kinsley of the World Food Program in Sudan.
*10:16.740- 10:21.840* :  As it prepared for its ground invasion of Gaza, Israel ordered Palestinians to move south,
*10:22.260- 10:27.260* :  saying it was trying to prevent civilian casualties. Many ended up in the city of Khan Unis,
*10:27.260- 10:32.720* :  but they too are now being told to leave. One of those who moved from north to south was BBC
*10:32.720- 10:38.500* :  Arabic's cameraman Jihad El Masharawi, traveling with his family along a road designated by Israel
*10:38.500- 10:44.820* :  as a safe corridor. He says it was a terrifying journey as Marwan Lassa reports.
*10:49.100- 10:53.260* :  BBC cameraman Jihad El Masharawi and his two-year-old boy Jad
*10:54.980- 11:01.040* :  as the drones hung outside his home in Al Zaitun in northern Gaza. He tries to take his children's
*11:01.040- 11:08.200* :  attention away from fear by baking bread. But on the 13th of October, the Israeli military
*11:08.200- 11:13.980* :  dropped leaflets ordering over a million residents in northern Gaza to move south.
*11:16.760- 11:23.960* :  All my BBC colleagues had already fled south. They told me how bad the situation was. No electricity,
*11:24.660- 11:30.160* :  no water. I didn't want to go. I wanted to delay the suffering my family would have to face
*11:30.520- 11:38.940* :  for as long as possible. Jihad's mother just trod at the prospect of leaving her home.
*11:41.900- 11:45.680* :  The house's opposite our home were being bombed one after another.
*11:47.160- 11:50.900* :  I had already lost one son. I couldn't risk losing another.
*11:52.400- 11:57.240* :  Jihad his wife four sons and elderly parents leave their home.
*11:57.240- 12:05.300* :  In the rush to go, we didn't even close our front door. Then we started our journey through
*12:05.300- 12:14.460* :  here. We walked to the route connecting north and south Gaza, Salahuddin Road. Sometimes it's
*12:14.460- 12:22.760* :  nothing more than a dirt track lined by war-damaged buildings. The route had been declared a safe
*12:22.760- 12:30.940* :  corridor by the Israeli defence forces. There were Israeli soldiers stationed in
*12:30.940- 12:36.460* :  demolished buildings along the road. We walked for hours and you eventually would have to cross
*12:36.460- 12:42.860* :  the Israeli army's checkpoint. We were nervous. My children kept asking, what will the soldiers
*12:42.860- 12:49.680* :  do to us? We came to a stop about a kilometer from the checkpoint itself, joining a long queue of
*12:49.720- 12:55.500* :  people that stretched across the entire width of the road. We spent more than four hours waiting.
*12:57.180- 13:03.920* :  People were crying and there was no room to sit down. My father fainted and we had to hold him.
*13:03.920- 13:10.480* :  When we entered the checkpoint, it felt like judgment day. I saw about 50 people in total
*13:10.880- 13:16.140* :  get detained, all men. They were asked to strip to their underwear and sit on the ground.
*13:16.580- 13:22.560* :  The Israeli defence forces told the BBC. Individuals suspected of affiliations with terrorist
*13:22.560- 13:28.260* :  organisations are detained for preliminary inquiries and if they remain suspects they are transferred
*13:28.260- 13:34.240* :  to Israel. Others are promptly released. Clothes have to be removed to check for weapons
*13:34.240- 13:38.920* :  and those detained are clothed as soon as possible. A few meters beyond the checkpoint,
*13:39.020- 13:45.740* :  I saw four detainees in their underwear being blindfolded. Beside the demolished building,
*13:46.520- 13:52.880* :  there was a wall of sand. The blindfolded men were taken to the sand hill by soldiers and then
*13:52.880- 14:00.360* :  took steps down out of my vision. Then we heard come fire. I'm not sure whether they were shot
*14:00.360- 14:07.100* :  or not. The IDF said the sound of gunfire is heard throughout the combat area. Therefore,
*14:07.100- 14:12.240* :  it does not constitute an indication of shooting from a specific place of a certain type.
*14:12.960- 14:18.200* :  Further along the road, I saw about 10 bodies on the ground. I screamed at the top of my lungs
*14:18.200- 14:23.620* :  telling my children not to look. I told them to look at the sky and continue walking.
*14:24.620- 14:31.480* :  Then an Israeli tank appeared. It was moving towards us at speed. In our fry to get away,
*14:31.480- 14:38.160* :  we had to trample over those bodies. The IDF said tanks move along routes that intersect with the
*14:38.160- 14:42.920* :  Salah al-Din road. There is no case in which tanks move towards civilians moving from north to
*14:42.920- 14:49.840* :  south along the humanitarian corridor. The family reached Nozairat camp. It's so busy. They are
*14:49.840- 14:57.600* :  forced to sleep on the side of the road. The weather was freezing. It was the coldest night I've
*14:57.640- 15:03.140* :  ever experienced in my life. I had to take off my shirt to cover my youngest boy jet.
*15:04.640- 15:09.980* :  The next morning, we set off early for Hanyun's taking a donkey cart ride for some of the journey.
*15:10.700- 15:16.800* :  At Deryl Belah, we got on a bus with a capacity for 20. There wasn't enough room for us,
*15:17.140- 15:24.240* :  so some of us clung to the doors and windows. The next day, Jihad and his family reached Hanyun's.
*15:26.660- 15:34.040* :  He reunites with his BBC colleagues. Following a bombing, Jihad and his family decide to
*15:34.040- 15:41.340* :  head further south to Rafah. I knew that Bimanov were safe. I knew that the ground operation
*15:41.340- 15:48.400* :  would move towards Hanyun's. In Rafah, we are renting a small outhouse. The roof is made of tin
*15:48.400- 15:55.140* :  and plastic bags. If Shartnill falls, there is nothing to protect us. We have hardly anything to
*15:55.140- 16:01.760* :  eat and know where to go. All I want to do now is leave Resa and be safe with my children.
*16:04.140- 16:12.280* :  Barraport by Mawa Nasah. 137 Israeli soldiers have now died in the fighting in Gaza. That's on
*16:12.280- 16:18.180* :  top of the nearly 400 security personnel and some 800 civilians killed in southern Israel
*16:18.180- 16:23.940* :  in the Hamas attacks of the 7th of October, according to a tally by the AFP news agency.
*16:24.480- 16:31.800* :  Around 240 people were also taken hostage, with 80 released last month as part of a deal with Hamas.
*16:31.800- 16:37.780* :  The US President Joe Biden says he is pushing for another exchange, but today Hamas said the
*16:37.780- 16:43.740* :  Palestinians reject negotiations unless there's a full cessation of what it called Israeli aggression.
*16:43.740- 16:50.400* :  But while the diplomacy stalls, conditions in Gaza continue to get worse. Imaging folks reports
*16:50.400- 16:56.480* :  on the latest assessment from the World Health Organization. The WHO says hospitals in northern Gaza
*16:56.480- 17:02.680* :  have become hospices where people are simply waiting to die. With no surgical capacity left,
*17:02.680- 17:09.500* :  patients with serious injuries, perhaps requiring amputation, now risk dying of wound infections.
*17:09.580- 17:14.720* :  The WHO also reported severe shortages of food and water,
*17:14.720- 17:20.840* :  describing meeting people with life-threatening untreated injuries, who begged not for medicine,
*17:20.840- 17:27.900* :  but for water. The WHO would like to evacuate many more patients out of Gaza for treatment in Egypt
*17:27.900- 17:33.280* :  or other countries. Imaging folks reporting. And from the fighting in Gaza,
*17:33.280- 17:39.440* :  we move to the war in Ukraine, and the first tennis grand slam of the new year begins soon in Australia.
*17:40.200- 17:44.880* :  Not so long ago, it would have featured the one-time world number 13, Alex Dahl-Hapolov,
*17:45.320- 17:49.660* :  who once reached the quarterfinals. During his career, he won more than seven and a half
*17:49.660- 17:53.920* :  million dollars in prize money, so he could be living a very comfortable life.
*17:54.500- 17:59.380* :  But instead, he chose to join the Ukrainian army. Gary Richardson asked him why.
*18:00.160- 18:05.540* :  It's my home, and it just happened like that. You know, I came to Ukraine two weeks after
*18:06.000- 18:12.000* :  the big invasion started, and was here getting to know people and just happened to meet a commander
*18:12.000- 18:18.120* :  with a friend. And then, just casually, I joined. And what's the last year being like for you?
*18:18.500- 18:25.180* :  Tough. We've had guys injured. We've had missions. I had some time to have rest, but yeah,
*18:25.180- 18:29.280* :  it's been tough on the battlefield the last year. I would say we didn't have big successes.
*18:29.280- 18:34.220* :  Didn't have big losses in terms of territories as well, but yeah, it's not been easy.
*18:34.660- 18:37.920* :  Can you tell me about some of the attacks that you came under?
*18:38.360- 18:44.780* :  Mostly it's artillery fire, sometimes aircraft. Mostly it's artillery working, and that's the
*18:44.780- 18:50.640* :  main danger. There was an occasion where I think possibly mortars, though, landed reasonably
*18:50.640- 18:57.000* :  close to you. Is that correct? Yeah, that's true. That was the worst, probably. They started firing.
*18:57.000- 19:02.040* :  We had to go in the trench because we were working out of the trench at that moment and
*19:02.040- 19:06.720* :  sit it out and just wait. Hope it doesn't land exactly in the trench.
*19:07.420- 19:11.160* :  What have you been told about how the war's going? What do you know?
*19:11.660- 19:16.320* :  We're told what they want us to hear, but we analyze by ourselves. At the moment,
*19:16.320- 19:22.740* :  mathematically, we're not in a good position. On the battlefield, they have advantages in most
*19:22.780- 19:28.620* :  of everything. They have more people. They still have more armor. They have more artillery rounds.
*19:28.620- 19:32.400* :  Hopefully the world understands this and we get what we need.
*19:32.400- 19:39.720* :  Is the world doing enough to help you? No, I don't think so. I think it's obvious by now.
*19:39.900- 19:45.520* :  We read all the news. We see what's on the battlefield. We see the math of all of this.
*19:46.000- 19:53.120* :  It's not enough. You say that as a former tennis player, perhaps the lessons that you learned from
*19:53.120- 20:00.640* :  sport can sometimes help you in the conflict. Just explain that. Yeah, for sure, because tennis is
*20:00.640- 20:05.940* :  a small war as well. You need to be mentally strong. You need to take fast decisions. You deal
*20:05.940- 20:11.060* :  with high pressure, nerves and everything. You can transform that to the war as well.
*20:11.360- 20:18.020* :  In another way, but still, I believe for me, it's a little bit easier than just a regular person.
*20:18.540- 20:21.660* :  Ukrainian tennis player, Tern Soldier, Alex Dolphopolo.
*20:23.860- 20:29.600* :  And still to come on the global news podcast? A warning for those drinking fizz, this Christmas.
*20:35.160- 20:39.680* :  Something mysterious plagues County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland and its legendary
*20:39.680- 20:48.680* :  Gaelic football team. The year is 1951 and County Mayo have just won the sports biggest prize.
*20:48.680- 20:53.840* :  But in the midst of situation, there's a funeral. And for the priest leading the congregation,
*20:54.060- 20:57.740* :  this sacrilege must be punished. A curse exits his lips.
*20:57.920- 21:01.920* :  Damn nation be upon every one of you. It came to pass.

*22:15.640- 22:20.200* :  Thousands of people in Argentina took to the streets of Buenos Aires on Wednesday evening to
*22:20.200- 22:24.280* :  protest against the new government's shock therapy aimed at rescuing the economy.
*22:29.140- 22:32.500* :  The new president, Javier Miele, announced sweeping economic reforms,
*22:32.500- 22:36.700* :  including plans to privatize state-run companies and slash government regulation.
*22:36.700- 22:42.480* :  In a TV address, he said he would restore Argentina's financial power after a century of
*22:42.480- 22:50.040* :  decline. Over the last hundred years, politicians have been busy expanding the power of the state
*22:50.040- 22:55.520* :  at the expense of decent Argentinians. This expansion of the state has been accompanied by the
*22:55.520- 23:01.620* :  greatest destruction of wealth in a country ever recorded. Our country, which at the beginning of
*23:01.620- 23:06.720* :  the 20th century was the world's leading power, has become embroiled over the last hundred years
*23:06.720- 23:12.000* :  in an endless cycle of crisis, all stemming from the same cause, physical deficit.
*23:17.040- 23:21.140* :  We didn't get a whole lot of details. I mean, he said that he wants to eliminate or change more
*23:21.140- 23:27.400* :  than 300 rules via this presidential degree. But some of them did include changes on rent,
*23:27.400- 23:33.180* :  energy subsidies, and labor practices. And even since his inauguration on the 10th December,
*23:33.180- 23:39.120* :  he has come in and has followed through and many of his campaign promises to really change the way
*23:39.120- 23:45.260* :  the economy works. And one of them is by devaluing its local currency, the peso, by over 50%.
*23:45.960- 23:49.880* :  And how much difference has that made in terms of perception of the markets?
*23:51.140- 23:56.000* :  You know, investors seemed happy. These are drastic steps. And clearly from the protesters,
*23:56.000- 24:01.380* :  you know, not everyone is happy about the changes that are being made. But in some of the analysts
*24:01.380- 24:05.560* :  that we have spoken to, they said that, you know, it's basically a house on fire and they really
*24:05.560- 24:11.140* :  have no choice but to make some dramatic changes. Argentina is Latin America's third biggest
*24:11.140- 24:16.840* :  economy, but it has really fallen on hard times for a while now in terms of its debt levels
*24:16.840- 24:24.120* :  and just financial mismanagement over the years. It's inflation has surpassed 160%. I mean,
*24:24.120- 24:29.980* :  one in four Argentinians live in poverty. So they are really struggling to get by at this point.
*24:29.980- 24:34.780* :  The economy is shrinking. And part of that has to do because of a drought. A good chunk of
*24:34.780- 24:41.460* :  its economy comes from grain exports and that's the places like China. So, you know, they're looking
*24:41.460- 24:46.960* :  at some drastic measures in terms of hiking taxes for grain exports, which could bring in some
*24:46.960- 24:53.660* :  revenue, but make some of their friends rather unhappy. Yeah. We heard the protesters there on
*24:53.660- 24:59.300* :  the streets. What specifically are they worried about with these reforms? A lot of these protesters
*24:59.320- 25:04.980* :  were there representing the unemployed. Especially young people are very concerned. There were
*25:04.980- 25:10.380* :  rent subsidies and some other things that they were really relying on. And it's very hard to find
*25:10.380- 25:17.220* :  a job right now. So it's hard to manage both making some real serious trims in the economy,
*25:17.220- 25:22.500* :  especially when it cuts back on social services and people who can't really afford to eat or put
*25:22.500- 25:28.140* :  a roof over their heads. Now, have you, Emily, is a populist? Has he said anything about how he will
*25:28.140- 25:34.800* :  respond to the protesters? He's going ahead with this plan. He was on the campaign trail. He didn't
*25:34.800- 25:39.340* :  really mince words, so to speak. He's quite a character. You know, he called himself the king
*25:39.340- 25:43.820* :  of the jungle and he carried a chainsaw around with him at some of these events as a symbol of his
*25:43.820- 25:49.260* :  plan to cut that spending. And he really went after, as we had just heard, what he called corrupt
*25:49.260- 25:55.040* :  politicians. So he is not really backing down a whole lot. Our business correspondent Monica Miller.
*25:55.960- 26:01.920* :  Today marks the 35th anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing when Pan Am flight 103 from London to
*26:01.920- 26:08.100* :  New York was blown out of the sky. 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground were killed.
*26:08.140- 26:14.640* :  Among the dead was 23-year-old Flora, daughter of Dr Jim Swire, who went on to become a spokesman
*26:14.640- 26:19.000* :  for the victim's families in Britain. He became convinced over the years that the claim that
*26:19.000- 26:25.340* :  Libya was involved is false. Dr Swire has been talking to Justin Webb. He began by speaking about
*26:25.340- 26:30.680* :  his daughter. Flora was a brilliant student. She decided off her own path without any
*26:30.680- 26:37.120* :  encouragement from me to read medicine, which she did at Nottingham. And she came out double for a
*26:37.120- 26:44.220* :  year and so on. And by the time of Lockerbie, she had met a nice American guy and she was on her
*26:44.220- 26:48.520* :  way to visit him for Christmas when she was brutally murdered with all those other people.
*26:49.120- 26:56.340* :  That is the intrinsic sadness of this. When somebody close is murdered like that, the family
*26:56.340- 27:06.380* :  are issued with a lifetime sentence of bereavement with Chicago. And I came across Shakespeare's play
*27:06.380- 27:13.960* :  Hamlet and his Hamlet at the end of the play saying to Horatio, in this harsh world,
*27:15.000- 27:23.500* :  draw my breath in pain to tell my story. And the story of Lockerbie has become a secondary
*27:23.660- 27:28.880* :  smaller tragedy in the fact that we have been thwarted at every turn for 35 years,
*27:29.700- 27:35.000* :  about being allowed to see the truth that our government knows about the disaster. And that is a
*27:35.000- 27:41.540* :  tragedy in itself because it cripples chances that we might have had in our search for the truth,
*27:42.300- 27:49.420* :  perhaps even to forgive those who are really responsible. You've described in moving terms the
*27:49.420- 27:54.780* :  impact that this has had, obviously on your daughter and on the other people killed but also
*27:54.780- 28:02.600* :  on their families. Have governments stepped up and done what they needed to do to support you
*28:02.600- 28:08.000* :  and to find out what happened? In terms of the British government, I think they've tried to do
*28:08.000- 28:14.620* :  what the American government wanted them to do. That is to say to handle the atrocity in a way
*28:14.620- 28:22.360* :  which suited American international political needs. And I'm sorry to say that I'm not aware
*28:22.360- 28:28.640* :  that our government had the regards to steer clear of what America wanted and to actually tell
*28:29.180- 28:35.480* :  individual citizens like me and like the families of all the others and tell them what they knew
*28:35.480- 28:40.100* :  about what really happened. Do they know, do you think what really happened? Oh, I think they know
*28:40.100- 28:45.420* :  great deal. And to this day, I'm like all the other tragedies in this country has been no
*28:45.420- 28:52.100* :  objective inquiry because unless we feel that will happen at some point, I personally will feel
*28:52.540- 28:58.800* :  I have failed the memory of the horrible death of my lovely daughter Flora and all those other
*28:58.820- 29:03.900* :  people who lost their lives in that crash as well. I hope that will happen one day but I don't
*29:03.900- 29:10.280* :  any longer believe I'll be on the planet to see it happen. Dr Jim Swire, you're listening to
*29:10.280- 29:17.040* :  the Global News podcast next to a sound which could be pretty common around Christmas.
*29:18.880- 29:23.920* :  Well, that noise will also punctuate some office parties at this time of year. And one of our
*29:23.920- 29:31.680* :  global news podcast reporters Will Chalk joined me in the studio with a bottle of Prosecco. I asked him
*29:31.680- 29:37.480* :  why. Well, sadly not, Oli to celebrate the culmination of another great half hour of your broadcasting
*29:37.600- 29:43.860* :  but because of a warning from scientists at the University of Cambridge, specifically the
*29:43.860- 29:49.560* :  Department of Ophthalmology. Now, obviously in the next week or so, a huge number of bottles like
*29:49.560- 29:54.320* :  this one, which I actually found under a manager's desk, are going to be popped around the world.
*29:54.940- 30:00.520* :  But writing in the British Medical Journal, researchers say cork injuries can provide a substantial
*30:00.520- 30:05.480* :  threat to eye health. They claim the pressure in a standard bottle of champagne is around three
*30:05.480- 30:11.940* :  times that of a car tire. And that means the cork can fly out up to 80 kilometers an hour which makes
*30:11.940- 30:18.100* :  the blinking reflex ineffective. So it can't protect you and then therefore you get hit which is
*30:18.100- 30:24.180* :  painful and dangerous. Yeah, I mean, this might sound like a bit of a non-issue, but apparently it's
*30:24.180- 30:30.080* :  not. The researchers don't give much of a sense of scale, but they point to the case of cyclist
*30:30.080- 30:36.280* :  Bin Yam Germay, who opened a bottle of champagne on the winner's podium at the Giro d'Italia. It hit
*30:36.280- 30:41.540* :  him in the eye and he had to withdraw from the next stage. I did a quick Google search to find a
*30:41.540- 30:47.380* :  couple of other examples and Theo Campbell, who featured on British Reality TV show Love Island,
*30:47.400- 30:51.840* :  had to have surgery after it happened to him in Ibiza in 2019.
*31:12.340- 31:17.360* :  Well, according to a study in 2005, in about a quarter of cases, the person's struck remains
*31:17.360- 31:25.540* :  legally blind. We'll chalk reporting. Finally, to a tip that maybe helps your Christmas season
*31:25.880- 31:32.020* :  become a little less stressful from the BBC's Rachel Burden. So this was just a moment of
*31:32.020- 31:37.800* :  inspiration I had when I realised I had a lot of things to wrap and very little time and I have
*31:38.620- 31:45.180* :  sometimes quite small presents and the thing that really takes up a lot of time in the wrapping
*31:45.180- 31:48.680* :  is you wrap a present and then you go to the wrapping paper and you get it and then you cut it and
*31:48.680- 31:53.680* :  then you wrap it right. Now, if you're down on the floor, if you pre-cut your wrapping paper into
*31:53.680- 31:59.040* :  small medium and large sizes, spend about 15-20 minutes doing that, then I'm telling you the speed
*31:59.040- 32:03.420* :  at which you can select the appropriate size of wrapping paper, get it round that gift, sell it
*32:03.420- 32:10.900* :  tape it up, bang into the bag, done, is unbelievable. Rachel Burden, not quite sure about that,
*32:10.900- 32:15.260* :  we just reused the same festive gift bags from the last year, bar humbuck.
*32:17.460- 32:21.420* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
