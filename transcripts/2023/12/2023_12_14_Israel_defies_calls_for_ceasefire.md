*01:30.260- 01:33.420* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Thursday,
*01:33.420- 01:38.860* :  the 14th of December. The Israeli Prime Minister defies calls for a cease fire in Gaza saying
*01:38.860- 01:45.140* :  the war will go on until Hamas is defeated. I say this in the face of great pain,
*01:45.140- 01:51.500* :  but also in the face of international pressure. Nothing will stop us. We will go on to the end.
*01:52.160- 01:58.180* :  Joe Biden's son Hunter refuses to testify in private in Congress and instead gives a news conference
*01:58.180- 02:04.120* :  at the Capitol. An investigator say the Wagner mercenary group made $2.5 billion for the Russian
*02:04.120- 02:12.920* :  war effort by smuggling gold from Africa. Also in the podcast, why two million Tesla's are being
*02:12.920- 02:18.460* :  recalled in the US? And going to the military itself isn't exactly a pleasant experience for
*02:18.460- 02:23.240* :  the majority and does feel like a huge imposition on them and something that they just don't
*02:23.240- 02:29.340* :  feel they should have to do if they don't want to. Should the world famous K-pop band BTS have been
*02:29.340- 02:39.400* :  exempt from military service? On the podcast this time yesterday, we reported on the US president's
*02:39.400- 02:45.340* :  strongest criticism yet of what he called Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza, as well as the
*02:45.340- 02:51.160* :  demand for an immediate ceasefire from three quarters of the world's nations in a vote at the UN.
*02:52.100- 02:57.000* :  On Wednesday, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a defiant response,
*02:57.000- 03:01.400* :  saying his forces will not stop until they've defeated Hamas.
*03:04.840- 03:11.100* :  And yet I want to say in the clearest possible terms what I just said to the commander in the field,
*03:11.980- 03:18.960* :  we will continue to the end. There is absolutely no question of that. I say this in the face of great
*03:18.960- 03:25.080* :  pain, but also in the face of international pressure. We will go on to the end. To victory,
*03:25.700- 03:30.900* :  nothing less. Well, the White House said that it had reiterated its concerns about civilian
*03:30.900- 03:36.920* :  casualties in Gaza, which run into many thousands. Here's the US State Department spokesman Matthew
*03:37.180- 03:42.340* :  Miller. We have seen too many civilians killed. We understand Israel's intent, but what also
*03:42.340- 03:46.820* :  matters is the results. We continue to monitor what's happening. We continue to collect information
*03:46.880- 03:51.960* :  at a variety of levels. And we continue to engage in conversations with the Israeli government
*03:51.960- 03:55.440* :  about the importance of adhering to international humanitarian law.
*03:56.020- 04:01.180* :  Well, the US National Security spokesman said that Israel had shown it was trying to act on
*04:01.180- 04:06.840* :  international concerns by, for example, carrying out fewer air strikes. At the same time,
*04:06.840- 04:12.900* :  fierce fighting is continuing in Gaza, where Israel says 10 of its soldiers, including a full
*04:12.900- 04:19.040* :  colonel, were killed over the previous 24 hours. Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Hugo Bachega,
*04:19.040- 04:24.820* :  told me what it all means for the Israeli military operation. This is evidence that pressure is
*04:24.820- 04:31.020* :  growing and even from Israel's most important ally, the United States. So, Jake Sullivan,
*04:31.020- 04:37.880* :  who is the National Security Advisor, will be in Israel on Thursday talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu,
*04:37.880- 04:44.960* :  also the war cabinet. Israeli media are reporting one of the topics to be discussed is a timeline for
*04:44.960- 04:50.680* :  the end of the war. Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying that the war continues, but I think the
*04:50.680- 04:56.600* :  reality is perhaps a little bit different. Do we have any idea of how close Israel is to meeting
*04:56.600- 05:01.560* :  its objectives? I see they've suffered their biggest single day loss for about six weeks,
*05:01.560- 05:06.660* :  reporting that 10 soldiers were killed over the past 24 hours. So, presumably, they'll also be
*05:06.660- 05:12.160* :  pressure from people inside Israel. I don't think they're very close to declaring victory because
*05:12.160- 05:18.440* :  just this week Hamas was firing rockets at Israel. And the top leadership hasn't been captured,
*05:18.440- 05:24.180* :  we're saying this massive operation now in Hanyunis, where the leader of Hamas in Gaza,
*05:24.180- 05:30.220* :  Yahya Sinwar, comes from and this is where the Israeli authorities believe that members of
*05:30.220- 05:36.000* :  the Hamas leadership are hiding. But those people haven't been captured and Hamas still has the
*05:36.000- 05:42.460* :  capacity to fight back. I think in Israel, there's still a lot of support for this operation against
*05:42.460- 05:48.320* :  Hamas. But there's also pressure on the Prime Minister to secure any kind of deal for the release
*05:48.320- 05:53.320* :  of the hostages. Remember that more than 100 people still remain in captivity in Gaza.
*05:53.640- 05:59.580* :  Now, in his reported comments on Tuesday, Joe Biden singled out the hard-right government in
*05:59.580- 06:04.220* :  Israel for some criticism. Has that featured at all in the Israeli media perhaps?
*06:04.520- 06:10.780* :  So, this is the most hard-line and religious government in Israel's history. It was very
*06:10.780- 06:15.880* :  interesting yesterday that President Biden said that Prime Minister Netanyahu had to change
*06:15.880- 06:21.380* :  its government because he said it was a government that was against the two-state solution,
*06:21.380- 06:27.120* :  which is the favorite proposal by the international community that sees the creation of an independent
*06:27.120- 06:32.220* :  Palestinian state. What is interesting is that Israeli media, the way they're seeing these comments
*06:32.220- 06:38.320* :  by the Prime Minister, is that perhaps he's trying to address concerns from his right-wing
*06:38.320- 06:42.900* :  supporters. So, he's playing a little bit of domestic politics, if you like. And don't forget
*06:42.900- 06:49.540* :  lots of questions about his policies, his decisions prior to the attacks. And many say that
*06:49.540- 06:54.160* :  because of those decisions, he allowed those attacks to happen. So, a lot of pressure on the
*06:54.160- 07:00.700* :  Prime Minister from all sides. Hugo Bachega in Jerusalem. Joe Biden's son Hunter has long been in
*07:00.700- 07:05.720* :  the sights of Republicans as they target the U.S. President. Hunter Biden has also faced
*07:05.720- 07:12.380* :  criminal charges, including for drugs, gun and tax offenses. But on Wednesday, he risked further
*07:12.380- 07:17.840* :  jeopardy by defying an order by Republicans in the House of Representatives to testify behind
*07:17.840- 07:24.180* :  closed doors about his business dealings. He said he was prepared to give evidence, but only in
*07:24.180- 07:28.800* :  public. And he proceeded to give a news conference on the steps of the Capitol Building.
*07:28.960- 07:34.440* :  During my battle with addiction, my parents were there for me. They literally saved my life.
*07:35.040- 07:41.120* :  And in the adepts of my addiction, I was extremely responsible with my finances. But to suggest
*07:41.120- 07:45.560* :  that his grounds for an impeachment inquiry is beyond the absurd. It's shameless.
*07:46.140- 07:50.680* :  There's no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my
*07:50.680- 07:57.920* :  business, because it did not happen. The House Republicans are trying to find evidence of corruption,
*07:57.920- 08:02.980* :  as part of their effort to impeach President Biden. I asked Darko Respondent in
*08:02.980- 08:07.760* :  Washington, Nomiya Ikbal, about the implications of Hunter Biden's refusal to obey the Republican
*08:07.760- 08:14.660* :  subpoena. He could now be held in contempt of Congress. And this is what those Republicans
*08:14.660- 08:21.380* :  on the oversight committee are saying. And that could potentially carry a jail sentence. We don't
*08:21.380- 08:26.420* :  know fully what the next step will be. But look, I think it's really significant that Hunter Biden
*08:26.940- 08:32.160* :  spoke in the way he did. It's a very rare emotional statement in which he was publicly lashing out
*08:32.740- 08:37.240* :  Republicans. So I think in that respect, it's significant. Also, it's the first time we've heard
*08:37.240- 08:42.180* :  from him since he was facing those criminal charges. He's going on trial next year. And this is
*08:42.180- 08:49.400* :  to do with gun possession and tax evasion. I guess also by offering to testify in public. Some
*08:49.400- 08:55.540* :  people might suggest that this whole row is politicized. And of course, it comes as Republicans
*08:55.540- 09:01.440* :  move to try to impeach President Biden. What's happening there? On the first point that you
*09:01.440- 09:05.960* :  make that's really interesting because also Hunter Biden is basically saying, look, I'll testify
*09:05.960- 09:11.740* :  for this committee, but I will do it publicly so everyone can see it, rather than doing it behind
*09:11.740- 09:17.380* :  closed doors because he does lost this investigation. Now, in terms of the impeachment inquiry,
*09:17.380- 09:22.220* :  that's been going on since September since the Republicans, Kevin McCarthy, the then House Speaker
*09:22.220- 09:28.660* :  announced it unilaterally. And so it's not an official inquiry. Jim Jordan, who's on the House
*09:28.660- 09:35.080* :  Oversight Committee, has said, in terms of what happens next, they're going to hopefully
*09:35.080- 09:41.820* :  interview everyone they need to for this investigation and that they will decide early next year
*09:41.820- 09:46.840* :  if to then go ahead, if they've got the evidence they need to go with an impeachment vote. But
*09:46.840- 09:49.760* :  what's going to happen tonight is they're going to formalize something that they've already been
*09:49.760- 09:54.000* :  doing, which is investigating whether there should be an impeachment.
*09:54.340- 09:59.280* :  Eggball in Washington. The European Commission has unlocked funding for
*09:59.280- 10:05.500* :  Hungary worth up to 11 billion dollars. It had been frozen in a dispute about the rule of law.
*10:05.500- 10:11.260* :  The unfreezing came on the eve of a European Union leader summit at which the Hungarian Prime Minister,
*10:11.260- 10:16.580* :  Victor Orban, was threatening to block key decisions on Ukraine. From Brussels, his to any
*10:16.580- 10:22.440* :  about. With tensions building over Hungary's lone stance on Ukraine comes what could be a decisive move.
*10:23.100- 10:26.940* :  The European Commission insists it's been following due process and that the frozen
*10:26.940- 10:31.980* :  funds are being released as Hungary has taken the measures it had committed to to bolster judicial
*10:31.980- 10:37.600* :  independence. The Commission does not link the step to Hungary threatening to block both new
*10:37.600- 10:43.320* :  funds for Ukraine and moves to open talks with Kiev on joining the EU at the leader summit.
*10:43.420- 10:49.160* :  But critics say it's responded to blackmail by Prime Minister Orban. One outraged green
*10:49.160- 10:55.920* :  MEP called it the biggest bribe in EU history. The Russian mercenary group Wagner has
*10:55.920- 11:01.000* :  been active in Africa for at least six years, but has largely escaped detailed scrutiny.
*11:01.660- 11:05.900* :  Now, Western researchers have revealed that the group has made two and a half billion dollars
*11:05.900- 11:11.340* :  from smuggling African gold, with the money helping to fund the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
*11:11.420- 11:17.360* :  The Blood Gold report found that Wagner was involved in the illegal gold trade in Sudan,
*11:17.360- 11:22.520* :  the Central African Republic and Mali, as I heard from my Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton.
*11:22.900- 11:28.480* :  In the Central African Republic, Wagner has been given the exclusive rights to the largest gold
*11:28.480- 11:34.900* :  mine in the country and similarly in Darfur, a refinery has been given to Sudan, has been given
*11:34.900- 11:41.360* :  to Wagner. The report says that in these countries the Kremlin relies on complex smuggling routes
*11:41.360- 11:47.140* :  and corporate subterfuge, so that's like bogus companies, to extract large amounts of blood
*11:47.140- 11:53.080* :  gold out of the continent into Russia and the UAE, where it's mixed with legitimate sources of
*11:53.080- 11:59.800* :  gold and then converted i.e. sold for cash. And then slightly differently in Mali, the junta
*11:59.800- 12:05.520* :  there gets most of its tax revenue from international mining companies like a Canadian corporation
*12:05.560- 12:12.980* :  called Barric Gold Corp. And effectively, Wagner is propping up the military regime and these
*12:12.980- 12:18.820* :  mining companies are effectively paying Wagner salaries. One of the report's authors is David
*12:18.820- 12:24.900* :  Clement, who's a Canadian researcher and he was focusing on Mali. We're calling on governments to
*12:24.900- 12:32.180* :  deliver sanctions that stop Russia, profiting from blood gold and for companies like Canada's Barric Gold
*12:32.180- 12:39.560* :  to get out of Mali because we are now at a point where these mining companies provide more than
*12:39.560- 12:48.720* :  50% of the state's total revenue and we know based on numerous accounts that a significant portion
*12:48.720- 12:56.860* :  of that revenue is going to the Wagner mercenary group. And I can't see how any of those companies
*12:56.860- 13:03.180* :  who operate there can continue to do so knowing that they are funding Putin's mercenaries.
*13:03.620- 13:09.520* :  For Western companies, they have to ask themselves the question of whether or not they're comfortable
*13:09.520- 13:15.020* :  funding that. David Clement, one of the authors of the Blood Gold report and what does this pressure
*13:15.020- 13:20.800* :  group say should be done about it all? So they want wider sanctions, they want stringent controls on
*13:20.800- 13:26.780* :  the supply chain. This actually happened in terms of blood diamonds and the trade that came from
*13:26.780- 13:32.800* :  rebels in Sierra Leone about 20 years ago and they want a greater responsibility from these
*13:32.800- 13:38.660* :  mining companies. They want Wagner to be designated as a terrorist organization and they want the
*13:38.660- 13:45.040* :  West to support the existing democratic states in Africa which are feeling threatened by Wagner.
*13:45.500- 13:51.960* :  So what we've seen is Russia always has this anti-imperialistic rhetoric but it seems like they are
*13:51.960- 13:57.740* :  now doing the same thing. They're exploiting Africa for its resources for dubious ends while
*13:57.740- 14:02.980* :  committing horrendous human rights abuses. Richard Hamilton, our Africa regional editor.
*14:03.820- 14:08.560* :  The Hollywood actor Denzel Washington is causing something of a stir in Tunisia after he was
*14:08.560- 14:13.880* :  cast to play Hannibal, the ancient general who famously crossed the Alps to fight the Romans.
*14:14.640- 14:20.000* :  The Carthaginian leader came from what is modern day Tunisia and some there have questioned
*14:20.000- 14:24.460* :  the actor's suitability for the part, seemingly because he is African-American.
*14:24.460- 14:31.440* :  Local media have described it as a historical error. An online petition signed by 1,300 people
*14:31.440- 14:37.640* :  has urged Netflix to cancel the production. James Coppnell spoke to the Tunisian film critic
*14:37.640- 14:42.980* :  Faruk Fachichi who started by explaining how important Hannibal is to Tunisians.
*14:43.240- 14:50.900* :  Hannibal Barkas is one of the greatest military leader in history. He's like Alexander the Great
*14:50.900- 14:59.900* :  for Greeks or Napoleon for French. So he's a very emblematic figure for Tunisians and in all these
*14:59.900- 15:07.060* :  years his face remains unreachable and unified. There's a need to put a face on it and to give a life
*15:07.060- 15:15.940* :  to his story and cinema in Tunisia is not capable of doing such an epic. So such a news would be
*15:15.940- 15:22.940* :  very exciting for Tunisians to see this amazing adventurer of his in the big screen.
*15:23.240- 15:30.000* :  And yes it seems that some people are not happy why? Hannibal as I said he doesn't have a known face
*15:30.000- 15:37.780* :  except of an ancient statue in Upper Immuseum. So he imagined his face but we know that he's
*15:37.840- 15:46.880* :  finished so his origins are from Lebanon I mean his ancestry but his family is aristocratic family
*15:46.880- 15:54.280* :  that lived for centuries in North Africa in Tunisia. So he would probably be like Tunisian
*15:54.280- 16:02.700* :  see themselves as well as all North Africans like we say we fish or light brown. And so for many
*16:02.700- 16:10.760* :  people it's a bit weird or inaccurate to see him with the face off into Washington. Faroq Fachichi
*16:10.760- 16:18.740* :  talking to James Coppnell and still to come on the global news podcast. Harry and the grand
*16:18.740- 16:24.260* :  you Santa tell me was not well received when it came out about a decade ago. That's one of the
*16:24.260- 16:28.320* :  songs you hear in the shops everywhere all the time now it's definitely a Christmas classic note.
*16:28.840- 16:33.320* :  With nostalgia all the rage what are the Christmas classics of the future?
*16:42.580- 16:47.720* :  The deal finally agreed on Wednesday morning after all night negotiations at the UN Climate
*16:47.720- 16:53.900* :  Summit in Dubai certainly didn't please all the nearly 200 nations involved. But it did win
*16:53.900- 16:59.960* :  praise from some including the UN chief for finally recognizing the need to transition away from
*16:59.960- 17:05.860* :  fossil fuels. President Biden said it was a historic milestone and the EU chief first you
*17:05.860- 17:12.000* :  love on the lion said it marked the start of the post fossil era. But the former US Vice President
*17:12.000- 17:17.080* :  Al Gore said there were loopholes that betrayed what he called the influence of petro states
*17:17.100- 17:22.900* :  and small island nations say they were ignored these climate activists gave their reaction.
*17:23.400- 17:27.560* :  The latest version of the text that has just been approved is better than the one we had yesterday
*17:27.560- 17:32.340* :  but the one we had yesterday was so bad that it is easy to do better. We were told this was going
*17:32.340- 17:37.880* :  to be a historic cop and the outcome is far from it it's lukewarm at best. What we are missing
*17:37.880- 17:44.080* :  is finance that is massively needed to support developing countries to transition away from fossil
*17:44.140- 17:49.920* :  fuels. While we are upset at the results there's people here who are celebrated and you know
*17:49.920- 17:54.760* :  we're giving crumbs to celebrate but it's like asking us to celebrate flowers that will lie on our
*17:54.760- 18:00.180* :  graves. Energy producing countries welcomed the deal saying it won't affect their ability to
*18:00.180- 18:05.840* :  export oil. Our climate editor just in rollout considers how much the agreement will contribute
*18:05.840- 18:11.660* :  to efforts to cut carbon emissions. The final deal is stronger than it looked like it was going to
*18:11.660- 18:18.340* :  be at one stage but the language is still slippery. That is perhaps inevitable given it is
*18:18.340- 18:24.720* :  attempting to forge a consensus between the almost 200 countries of the world. The big
*18:24.720- 18:32.100* :  win is that the words fossil fuels appear in the final resolution even if the call is only for
*18:32.100- 18:38.240* :  countries to contribute to taking action on climate change. My metaphor is the washing up.
*18:38.480- 18:43.720* :  If I tell my wife I'm going to contribute to the effort to wash up I'm likely to get short
*18:43.720- 18:51.060* :  shrift from her but despite that this deal does represent progress. The hope is that sending a
*18:51.060- 18:57.320* :  fairly clear signal of the world's intention to progressively lessen its dependence on fossil fuels
*18:57.320- 19:04.140* :  will create a disincentive for investment and it will also add momentum to something that appears
*19:04.140- 19:11.100* :  elsewhere in the text and in treaty to massively increase the rollout of clean energy systems.
*19:11.100- 19:18.000* :  This agreement is far from perfect. It may not demand all the action the science says is necessary
*19:18.000- 19:27.040* :  but it does show us that the world can sometimes at least begin to move in the right direction.
*19:27.480- 19:32.900* :  Our climate editor just in rollout. Global markets have reacted cautiously to the news that
*19:32.900- 19:38.500* :  Argentina will devalue its peso. The news came just two days after heavy emily took office
*19:38.500- 19:44.240* :  as the new leader amid promises of radical action to tackle a growing financial crisis in the
*19:44.240- 19:50.980* :  South American country. Inflation, or the rate at which prices increase, is nearing 150% there
*19:51.500- 19:56.280* :  and two-fifths of the population live in poverty. Here's the new economy minister, Luis Caputo,
*19:56.280- 20:02.760* :  speaking in a TV address on Tuesday night. In other words, we're going to be worse off
*20:02.760- 20:07.640* :  than before for a few months, particularly in terms of inflation. And I say that because as the
*20:07.640- 20:12.220* :  president says, it's better to tell an uncomfortable truth than a comfortable lie.
*20:12.540- 20:17.300* :  Well, the action has been welcomed by the International Monetary Fund which is owed $33 billion
*20:17.300- 20:21.660* :  by Argentina. Our South America correspondent Katie Watson reports.
*20:22.180- 20:26.920* :  Havier Malay's administration isn't wasting time in implementing its promised shock therapy
*20:26.920- 20:36.360* :  to fix Argentina's financial problems. In a televised speech last night, the new
*20:36.360- 20:41.240* :  economy minister, Luis Caputo, said he'd cut the pesos' official exchange rate by more than
*20:41.240- 20:47.620* :  50% to 800 pesos to the dollar. It was part of a much awaited package of measures that also
*20:47.620- 20:52.800* :  included cutting energy and transport subsidies as well as slashing government ministries and jobs.
*20:53.340- 20:56.560* :  Mr. Caputo warned that the effects would be painful in the short term.
*20:57.140- 21:00.380* :  Argentina isn't the first country to devalue its currency this year.
*21:00.380- 21:04.820* :  Egypt, Lebanon, Nigeria and Pakistan have also made similar moves.
*21:05.360- 21:10.120* :  Devaluation makes imported goods more expensive, adding to inflation, which is already
*21:10.120- 21:16.140* :  running at more than 140% a year in Argentina. It can also make it more expensive to make payments
*21:16.140- 21:22.020* :  on foreign debts. So why do it? It makes exports cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers,
*21:22.020- 21:26.900* :  helping to grow the economy. The IMF, to which Argentina is heavily indebted,
*21:27.200- 21:32.680* :  said the move was bold and would improve public finances and stabilize the economy in the long term.
*21:32.680- 21:40.200* :  Katie Watson. Now let me take you back to the 30th of July 2020 and a NASA launch at Kennedy Space
*21:40.200- 21:49.140* :  Center. Five, four, engineering mission, two, one, two, three, relate and lift off as the
*21:49.140- 21:54.000* :  countdown to bars continues. The perseverance of humanity, launching the next generation of
*21:54.000- 21:59.200* :  robotic explorers to the red planet. Well, seven months after taking off from Florida,
*21:59.200- 22:06.140* :  Perseverance eventually landed on Mars and for the past 1000 days, it has been exploring.
*22:06.140- 22:12.440* :  Now the US Space Agency says the rover has essentially completed the job it was sent up there to do.
*22:12.700- 22:17.260* :  The announcement was made at a major science conference in San Francisco. Our correspondent
*22:17.260- 22:23.420* :  Jonathan Amos was there and he told me more about the rover's mission. It was asked to go into a
*22:23.420- 22:29.360* :  big crater on the northern side of Mars, a place called Jezero Crater. It's about 45 kilometers
*22:29.360- 22:35.100* :  across. It's an old impact basin and it was asked to survey that to study the rocks and then it
*22:35.100- 22:40.740* :  was asked to drill those rocks to collect up a whole load of samples that could be sent back
*22:40.740- 22:46.200* :  to Earth at some point in the future, which may be able to tell us that Mars was not just
*22:46.200- 22:52.120* :  habitable three and a half billion years ago, but also actually had life. Maybe within those
*22:52.120- 22:58.740* :  rock samples are evidence of ancient biology on the red planet. So it's been all over the crater
*22:58.920- 23:04.860* :  and it's drilled a whole series of rocks, different types of rocks. And if you were to bring those
*23:04.860- 23:10.660* :  rocks back today, you'd go great. Thanks very much Perseverance. Job well done and that's essentially
*23:10.660- 23:15.600* :  what NASA has said to the Perseverance team. How are we going to get these rocks back to Earth to
*23:15.600- 23:20.620* :  analyze them? It's something that NASA is going to do with the European Space Agency. It will
*23:20.620- 23:27.000* :  involve sending a rocket to the surface of Mars, putting the samples that Perseverance has gathered
*23:27.000- 23:33.960* :  into that rocket and then blasting them into space for the journey home. It is an extraordinary
*23:33.960- 23:40.320* :  robotic endeavor that will cost billions of dollars. And NASA is not sure that it has the money
*23:40.320- 23:46.020* :  just at the moment to do it. The European Space Agency is already starting to build hardware for
*23:46.020- 23:51.780* :  this mission, but when it actually takes place, we're going to have to wait for a review panel to
*23:51.780- 23:58.620* :  report in the new year. Chinese are going to go soon and try and do this. So maybe that will egg them
*23:58.620- 24:03.740* :  on a little bit, but I can't tell you right at the moment when those rock samples that Perseverance
*24:03.740- 24:09.180* :  has talked to when it's belly, when they will come back to Earth. While we wait, what will Perseverance
*24:09.180- 24:13.540* :  be doing up on the red planet? It's going to climb out of this crater. It's going to look at rocks
*24:13.540- 24:19.040* :  that are even older than the marine Jezero crater to try and see if there were habitable environments
*24:19.040- 24:24.940* :  further back in time. Maybe a little bit more than four billion years ago and see if there might
*24:24.940- 24:30.140* :  be clues to life on the red planet way, way back in the history of the solar system. Our science
*24:30.140- 24:36.480* :  correspondent Jonathan Amos in San Francisco. The world's most valuable carmaker Tesla has issued a
*24:36.480- 24:42.500* :  recall for two million vehicles after safety regulators found problems with the autopilot system.
*24:43.120- 24:48.480* :  They'd been investigating crashes involving Tesla's special driver assistance software.
*24:48.480- 24:54.180* :  The firm, owned by Elon Musk, said it would send a software update to fix the problem, more
*24:54.180- 24:59.600* :  details from our technology editor Zoe Kleinman. The recall covers almost every Tesla sold in the US
*24:59.600- 25:04.840* :  since autopilot was launched in 2015, but the cars won't have to be returned to a showroom.
*25:05.140- 25:08.520* :  Tesla will send a software update to affected vehicles over the air,
*25:08.880- 25:12.540* :  similar to the way in which smartphones and laptops get operating system updates.
*25:12.540- 25:17.340* :  Contrary to its name, autopilot is not allowed to take over from human control.
*25:17.340- 25:22.240* :  The US regulator was specifically concerned about one of its features called auto-steer,
*25:22.480- 25:26.220* :  which is designed to keep the vehicle in the correct lane and match the speed of surrounding
*25:26.220- 25:30.780* :  traffic. But it's still supposed to alert drivers if they take their hands off the wheel or lose
*25:30.780- 25:35.960* :  concentration. Tesla said the software update should encourage drivers to remain alert.
*25:35.960- 25:40.680* :  The decision affects US-based Tesla's only, but its cars are on the roads in many other
*25:40.680- 25:45.700* :  countries as well, including the UK. Zoe Kleinman. Now, for a bit of K-pop.
*25:54.540- 25:59.280* :  I'm reliably informed that that is butter by the South Korean boyband BTS.
*26:00.180- 26:05.600* :  They have been forced to swap their microphones for military fatigues at the height of their
*26:05.600- 26:11.120* :  fame. On Tuesday, the lead vocalist Jung Kook joined the rest of the band in enlisting for
*26:11.120- 26:17.160* :  military service, a requirement for all able-bodied South Korean men aged 18-28.
*26:17.880- 26:24.920* :  So how have the millions of fans of the world famous K-pop band reacted to their compulsory 18-month
*26:24.920- 26:30.560* :  break-up? Nulam Agoven spoke to Dr. Sarah Saan, a senior lecturer in Korean studies at the
*26:30.560- 26:37.300* :  University of Sheffield. I think it's a mixture of a sort of outpouring of grief and despair that
*26:37.360- 26:41.960* :  they're going to be off the scene because one member, Sir Tongok, has had huge success over the
*26:41.960- 26:45.800* :  last few months, even in the UK. You just hear his songs playing constantly and I think there's
*26:45.800- 26:50.160* :  a sense that you're going to be disappearing from sight, particularly as their presence is so
*26:50.160- 26:54.640* :  pervasive on social media and on television and in popular news. But I think there's also
*26:54.640- 26:59.480* :  an understanding that this is sort of part of Korea's legal and cultural landscape and it's
*26:59.480- 27:02.860* :  just something that has to happen as well. So I think there's a resignation to it and I hope that
*27:02.860- 27:07.560* :  they'll be back afterwards. They're pop stars and they're huge and they're known around the world,
*27:07.560- 27:14.320* :  but they're not exempt from military service. But some athletes and classical musicians are
*27:14.320- 27:20.600* :  why the disparity? Well, I think this is a system that has been part of Korea's politics since it
*27:20.600- 27:27.720* :  was founded in 1948. And so back then, the only way that someone could achieve national prestige
*27:27.720- 27:33.240* :  internationally for South Korea was in international sporting events, classical music competitions.
*27:33.360- 27:39.620* :  It's only very recently that K-pop has become not only a space where individuals and groups could
*27:39.620- 27:45.360* :  achieve international prestige for Korea, but it's also much more accessible globally. It's
*27:45.500- 27:49.900* :  drowned out all of those other, I think, spaces where Korea does achieve recognition and
*27:49.900- 27:54.180* :  prize winning, I suppose. I think they're definitely having some difficult discussions domestically.
*27:54.180- 27:58.700* :  I think the National Defence Ministry or whatever the equivalent is, did it, had to do a survey of
*27:58.860- 28:03.360* :  public sentiment around this, which still found that quite a large number of people actually did
*28:03.360- 28:08.360* :  think that groups like BTS should be exempt. But yeah, there is a real tension there that is sort
*28:08.360- 28:12.540* :  of, I think, perhaps taking policy makers unawares and they're having to have some really difficult
*28:12.540- 28:18.100* :  conversations. And what about young South Koreans? And it's just men that do military service.
*28:18.340- 28:25.120* :  Compulsory, yes. Yes, you're compulsory. Is there any pushback against them doing it in that
*28:25.120- 28:30.220* :  larger arena, even away from the pop stars and the musicians? Yes, absolutely. I mean, it's been a
*28:30.400- 28:36.940* :  key issue among others in the last few years where men have started to be more vocal about the
*28:36.940- 28:42.200* :  problems that it causes for them entering the job market later than women, so they feel that they
*28:42.200- 28:46.600* :  have more catching up to do. And just going to the military itself isn't exactly a pleasant experience
*28:46.600- 28:51.700* :  for the majority and it does feel like a huge imposition on them and something that they just
*28:51.700- 28:57.280* :  don't feel they should have to do if they don't want to. Lula McGovern talking to Dr. Sarah Son.
*28:57.900- 29:03.200* :  This time of year, it can be hard to get away from Christmas music. Many of the songs on the
*29:03.200- 29:08.680* :  playlist and shops and at parties actually go back decades out of yourself a merry little Christmas
*29:08.680- 29:14.720* :  or frosty the snowman, even fairy tale of New York by the Pogs, whose frontman Shane McGowan died
*29:14.720- 29:20.640* :  last month. But our new Christmas songs being written that will be hits in the future. Evan Davis
*29:20.640- 29:31.580* :  spoke to the Sunday Times music journalist Lisa Verrico. Pop at the moment is incredibly
*29:31.580- 29:36.580* :  nostalgic. People love discovering old songs which are new to them and finding out the history
*29:36.580- 29:40.960* :  of songs, so pop is definitely going through in the stardust phase at the moment where you could
*29:40.960- 29:44.500* :  say pop is catching up with Christmas because we've always listened to old Christmas songs.
*29:53.320- 29:57.820* :  It's very difficult to get a new Christmas song away now. There's still popular everybody wants
*29:57.820- 30:02.840* :  to make so much money but very few people are having hits with them. Let us talk through a few
*30:02.840- 30:08.320* :  that people can add to their Christmas playlist to freshen them up and we have to start with Taylor Swift.
*30:08.640- 30:12.560* :  If anybody can make something work in 2023 it's got to be tight Taylor Swift.
*30:19.260- 30:23.780* :  Christmas Tree Farm which came out a couple of years ago. Taylor Swift did grow up on the Christmas
*30:23.780- 30:29.860* :  Tree Farm. I would not say it's a classic Taylor Swift song but you never know because Christmas
*30:29.860- 30:35.460* :  songs now are a bit of a slow burn so you could find it in the next few years becoming a Christmas
*30:35.460- 30:39.200* :  staple but at the minute it's quite far away from that. Suggest another one then.
*30:39.360- 30:49.060* :  Santa tell me if you're really bad don't make me fall in love again if it won't be here next year.
*30:59.760- 31:06.300* :  Ariana Grande's Santa tell me was not well received when it came out about a decade ago and that is
*31:06.300- 31:11.160* :  one of these songs a bit like Mariah's or the one for Christmas that every year has got bigger
*31:11.160- 31:15.200* :  and bigger. That's one of the songs you hear in the shops everywhere all the time now so that's
*31:15.200- 31:20.220* :  been a big slow burn but that's definitely a Christmas classic now I think. I did a Christmas
*31:20.220- 31:24.620* :  run down a couple of years ago for the Sunday Times and a Jack Savoretti brought a song called
*31:24.620- 31:30.080* :  Christmas Morning. When you talk about fairy tale of New York it's got a kind of proxy feel to it.
*31:30.460- 31:35.000* :  It's absolutely beautiful. I definitely seek that one out. That's definitely always on my Christmas list.
*31:35.840- 31:47.180* :  Christmas morning I'll be here. You can tell me what you'll see. May your nightmares
*31:47.740- 31:53.360* :  category be here. So Lisa what do you think Christmas number one is going to be this year?
*31:53.900- 31:58.220* :  It would be lovely a fairy tale of New York number one I think everybody would like that.
*31:58.640- 32:02.860* :  Honestly if I was going to bet a lot of money on it I'd stick with Mariah Curie.
*32:18.900- 32:22.700* :  Lisa Verrico talking to Evan Davis about her Christmas music favorites.
*32:23.500- 32:28.140* :  Now before we go there's been a development while we've been recording on Republican
*32:28.140- 32:33.980* :  efforts to impeach the US President Joe Biden. The House of Representatives has voted along
*32:33.980- 32:40.160* :  party lines to open an impeachment inquiry. The Republicans have alleged bribery and corruption
*32:40.160- 32:46.160* :  during Mr Biden's tenure as Vice President. He denies wrongdoing and Democrats have dismissed
*32:46.160- 32:49.540* :  the Republican moves against the Biden family as a political stunt.
*32:49.740- 32:55.960* :  Today's impeachment inquiry vote is indeed part of the continuing effort to deny Joe Biden
*32:55.960- 33:03.100* :  the office of President of the United States and we saw it happen on January 6th 2021 when Donald
*33:03.100- 33:10.780* :  Trump incited a violent insurrection to overturn the presidential election to set aside the work of
*33:11.160- 33:16.740* :  Congress and the peaceful transfer of power to disrupt Vice President Pence in the execution
*33:16.740- 33:22.560* :  of his duties and they tried to stop Biden from becoming President then and now this ridiculous
*33:22.560- 33:28.760* :  impeachment drive continues the effort to keep Biden from being able to do his presidential duties.
*33:29.080- 33:30.980* :  Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin.
