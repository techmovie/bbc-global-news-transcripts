*01:48.560- 01:52.400* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:54.360- 01:59.120* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 1400 hours GMT on Monday the 18th of December,
*01:59.120- 02:05.060* :  these are our main stories. The US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is in Israel as international
*02:05.060- 02:11.360* :  pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza intensifies. Official results from Egypt's presidential election
*02:11.360- 02:17.200* :  the Abdul Fatah al-Sisi has won a third-term in office with just under 90% of the vote.
*02:17.880- 02:22.980* :  A town in Germany has elected a mayor from the far-right AFD party for the first time.
*02:25.600- 02:30.640* :  Also in this podcast a court in Uganda here's a case that challenges anti-gay laws
*02:39.560- 02:46.400* :  past earlier this year and the sound experience conjuring up medieval Scotland for theatre
*02:46.400- 02:49.900* :  girls at a new production of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
*02:54.320- 02:59.280* :  International pressure is growing on Israel over its continuing bombardment of the Gaza Strip.
*02:59.660- 03:05.520* :  The death toll is rising. Hamas says 110 Palestinians were killed in one day in Israeli
*03:05.520- 03:11.140* :  airstrikes on the Jabalya refugee camp and two Palestinian Christian women sheltering inside
*03:11.140- 03:16.560* :  the Holy Family Church were shot dead at the weekend. Israel denies it was responsible.
*03:17.280- 03:22.280* :  Hundreds of civilians are still trapped in the church. Fifi Sabah, whose sister is among those in
*03:22.280- 03:28.120* :  the church, told us she feared for her sister's life. She was literally saying the situation is
*03:28.120- 03:33.540* :  really difficult. She kept saying that for a whole night but we didn't realize what's happening
*03:33.540- 03:40.080* :  until the next day which is yesterday when we found out about the shooting. So she wasn't even
*03:40.080- 03:47.800* :  able to communicate with us about the shooting and I found out later that day that she meant when
*03:47.800- 03:52.860* :  she said the situation is very difficult she was witnessing the killing of the two women in the
*03:53.660- 04:00.220* :  church. She's like we are hiding. They were actually on the ground hiding not moving because they
*04:00.220- 04:05.800* :  believed the Israelis were shooting anything that moves. So I think they were on the ground for
*04:05.800- 04:11.160* :  a couple of hours before they were able to just stand up or do something different. They were
*04:11.160- 04:16.740* :  terrified to go to the bathroom because the women were shot while trying to get to a toilet and
*04:16.740- 04:24.320* :  we also know that they have no water since yesterday. They completely cut them off. It's been more
*04:24.320- 04:32.420* :  than 24 hours and very, very limited food. They've been eating spaghetti for three weeks almost
*04:32.460- 04:39.880* :  like boiled spaghetti and that's it. And I think the past couple of days they have had no food.
*04:40.260- 04:46.280* :  I remember when they were first able to share pictures of them in the church praying. I remember
*04:46.280- 04:54.160* :  seeing so many kids and I remember feeling so heartbroken because as an adult I don't even know
*04:54.160- 05:00.140* :  what I would say to a child in this situation to make them feel safe. There's nothing you can say
*05:00.140- 05:04.960* :  to a child in that situation to make them feel safe. It breaks me.
*05:17.400- 05:24.180* :  We know nothing about the well-being. We can only speculate what's going on down there because
*05:24.700- 05:32.720* :  he's a young man. He's 23 years old and he's probably been taking care as a soldier which is not,
*05:32.720- 05:40.060* :  by the way. And we can only imagine the mental and psychological and physical views.
*05:41.160- 05:44.020* :  And it's very hard for me personally to think about it.
*05:45.000- 05:50.860* :  Do you have a sense that what the Israeli government is doing at the moment is likely
*05:51.760- 05:59.280* :  to lead to his release? I hope so. That's what they claim. The only problem that they are not
*05:59.300- 06:05.600* :  right now giving us the families, the ones that there are loved ones have been taken.
*06:06.420- 06:12.260* :  They don't give us a plan. They are not showing us any framework with specific goals.
*06:13.260- 06:18.660* :  And that's actually the problem right now that we hope and we believe that they are doing
*06:18.660- 06:25.820* :  enough and that they are doing the right things. But we demand that they will show us a plan
*06:25.820- 06:31.400* :  something that we can see the future in. The U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has arrived
*06:31.400- 06:36.920* :  in Israel for talks with his Israeli counterpart. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner is in
*06:36.920- 06:43.280* :  Jerusalem. Lloyd Austin's message will be they would like they the United States would like to see
*06:43.280- 06:50.040* :  Israel transition as soon as possible away from these very heavy as strikes, drone strikes,
*06:50.040- 06:57.020* :  artillery strikes and tank fire to a far more focused special forces type of mission in Gaza.
*06:57.620- 07:01.600* :  They're not going to say you've got to stop altogether. You've got no you know you can no longer
*07:01.600- 07:06.940* :  go after Hamas. But they are going to say that the kind of by day I mean him Lloyd Austin the
*07:06.940- 07:12.760* :  Defense Secretary he is going to be carrying the message from the White House that it's gone too far
*07:13.260- 07:19.820* :  and that the whole world pretty much now is lined up to call on Israel to pause its operations
*07:19.860- 07:26.120* :  because it's not in the very high death toll. It's the displacement of nearly two million people.
*07:26.860- 07:32.820* :  And there's lots of talk amongst aid agencies of whether war crimes have been committed. The
*07:32.820- 07:38.080* :  pope has called of some of the things that have been done around the church complex and act of
*07:38.080- 07:44.860* :  terrorism. This is bad optics for Israel. And although the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
*07:45.180- 07:50.020* :  adamant that they will continue and do whatever it takes to destroy Hamas one by one its friends
*07:50.580- 07:57.280* :  are calling off their unmitigated support. They are qualifying it now saying yes we support you
*07:57.760- 08:03.520* :  but not if you're going to keep on doing it this way. Frank Gardner. The elections authority in
*08:03.520- 08:08.980* :  Egypt has announced that President Abdel Fata Al-Sisi has won a third term in office following last
*08:08.980- 08:14.820* :  week's vote. A correspondent in Cairo, Salina Bil, Todas Moore. He was challenged by three
*08:14.820- 08:22.840* :  low profile politicians that many voters do not know even their names. So he won around 90%
*08:22.840- 08:28.940* :  of the of the votes and that does not come as a surprise at all because this election was largely
*08:28.940- 08:38.280* :  seen as one man show as a one horse race. 67% the turnout was but again there were a lot of
*08:38.280- 08:42.960* :  questions about the way people went to the polling stations because of her stories about people
*08:42.960- 08:48.080* :  who have been threatened by losing their jobs whether they work for public or private sector.
*08:48.680- 08:53.660* :  People who have been asked to go to the polling station and return for some financial incentives.
*08:53.660- 08:58.320* :  We've heard a lot of these stories but of course if you put these accusations to the government
*08:58.320- 09:04.160* :  they will deny it. And he has cracked down on political dissent throughout his time in power
*09:04.160- 09:09.580* :  hasn't he? So other extreme concerns for what is going to happen moving forward. A lot of
*09:09.580- 09:14.820* :  concerns about that indeed local and international human rights groups are talking about tens of
*09:14.820- 09:20.720* :  thousands of political prisoners. There was a potential frontrunner in this election and opposition
*09:20.720- 09:25.940* :  frontrunner. He dropped out of the race before the election started. He accused the authorities
*09:25.940- 09:31.920* :  of arresting more than 100 of his campaign members. He's now standing on trial after being
*09:31.920- 09:38.040* :  accused of circulating election papers without authorization. So this kind of paints a picture
*09:38.040- 09:42.760* :  about the human rights situation at the moment in Egypt under Mr. Ceci.
*09:43.500- 09:47.900* :  And the country is in a pretty pile of state isn't it especially regarding the economy.
*09:47.900- 09:52.740* :  What does he have to do? That's the key challenge for the president at the moment.
*09:52.780- 09:58.520* :  We are talking here about inflation rates that hit nearly 40 percent. Nearly 30 percent of
*09:58.520- 10:03.320* :  Egyptian families are living below the poverty line. I've talked to the lady the other day who
*10:03.320- 10:09.360* :  told me she hasn't both meet in three years because she can't afford it anymore. Many families
*10:09.360- 10:15.680* :  are dropping their children out of school because they can't afford the fees. The people are complaining
*10:15.680- 10:20.200* :  that they're living conditions have been going from bad to worse and they are pretty apprehensive
*10:20.200- 10:25.920* :  about the future. Another devaluation of the local currency is expected so that would push prices
*10:25.920- 10:32.820* :  up even more. So it's a pretty grim picture at the moment and we do not know if the president will
*10:32.820- 10:39.120* :  be able to do anything about it to fix it. Salina Bill. This winter will be the third in Afghanistan
*10:39.120- 10:45.080* :  since the Taliban take over and it's expected to be the worst in recent decades because of staggering
*10:45.080- 10:50.640* :  cuts in humanitarian aid. According to the World Food Programme, a third of the population is facing
*10:50.640- 10:57.220* :  acute hunger. But there's a huge funding shortfall. Aid has been hit because of a number of factors
*10:57.680- 11:02.640* :  including global economic conditions and international sanctions on the Taliban government.
*11:02.640- 11:09.280* :  But the Taliban's harsh restrictions on women have also played a major role. Yogi Tulumai reports now
*11:09.280- 11:20.120* :  from Kabul. I'm walking up a hill in the west of Kabul around me. There are homes, small ones
*11:20.140- 11:27.520* :  that are made of stones and bricks, mud and wood. This is an impoverished neighborhood of the city.
*11:28.420- 11:36.260* :  I've come up this hill to meet Saraya Azizi. She's a woman who lost her husband in a suicide
*11:36.260- 11:43.600* :  bombing 10 years ago. She has four children. She used to receive food assistance from the World
*11:43.600- 11:50.220* :  Food Programme, but that's been cut over the past year. Saraya's is one of two million homes in
*11:50.220- 11:58.860* :  Afghanistan run by women. The day they took back my WFP card, I felt like dying. My blood pressure
*11:58.860- 12:04.340* :  dropped. I kept thinking, what will I do now? When my children ask me for things which I can't
*12:04.340- 12:12.740* :  give them, it's so painful. Saraya wipes her tears and says, if the Taliban allowed women to go
*12:12.740- 12:23.920* :  out and work, things would be a lot better. Households headed by women, all those run by
*12:23.920- 12:31.280* :  widows, faces a series of blows here in Afghanistan not just from aid cuts, but also from Taliban
*12:31.280- 12:37.460* :  restrictions on women. I've come to the home of one woman who lost her husband three years ago.
*12:37.460- 12:44.860* :  She sells sunflower seeds on the streets. She has four children walking into their house now,
*12:45.300- 12:53.700* :  walking up stone steps. It is actually extremely cold in here. We're not identifying her for her
*12:53.700- 12:59.820* :  protection, but she's told us that the Taliban has stopped her several times from doing work.
*13:00.300- 13:09.740* :  I'm tired of this life. They should at least allow us to go out and earn and hone his living.
*13:10.700- 13:16.120* :  We are not going out to do anything bad. If I don't work, what will my four children eat?
*13:21.260- 13:26.980* :  According to the UN, a staggering 95% of Afghans are not eating enough food.
*13:27.480- 13:34.960* :  Another startling statistic, there are currently more than 870,000 children under the age of five
*13:34.960- 13:41.960* :  in this country who are malnourished. I'm currently in the malnutrition ward of the Indira Gandhi
*13:41.960- 13:50.440* :  Hospital in the city of Kabul and all around me there are beds with small children. Most of them
*13:50.440- 13:58.360* :  look extremely weak. This hospital along with dozens of others was being funded by the Red Cross.
*13:58.380- 14:02.840* :  Now the Red Cross has had to withdraw its support because of a lack of resources,
*14:03.540- 14:08.960* :  which endangers the operations of the last refuge for many like baby Mohamed Shafi.
*14:10.900- 14:13.820* :  At 18 months, he weighs less than half of what he should.
*14:14.560- 14:21.240* :  I asked the Taliban's main spokesman, Zabiyullah Majahid, who is now based in their seat of power,
*14:21.460- 14:23.920* :  Kandahar, about their policies.
*14:27.420- 14:33.620* :  If it is being used as a tool to pressure us, then the Islamic Emirate has its own values
*14:33.620- 14:41.060* :  which it will safeguard at any cost. Afghans have made big sacrifice in the past to protect our values.
*14:41.960- 14:44.240* :  And will endure the cutting of 8-2.
*14:45.960- 14:49.000* :  His words will not provide comfort for many Afghans,
*14:49.720- 14:53.640* :  millions of whom are going to bed every night on bread and water.
*14:56.340- 15:00.440* :  Ukraine has admitted that shortages in artillery ammunition will continue
*15:00.780- 15:05.260* :  as doubts remain over funding from its international allies. The Deputy Defence Minister,
*15:05.260- 15:10.740* :  Yvonne Gavriliyuk, has told the BBC that Kiev's confident funding will be ongoing,
*15:11.280- 15:14.480* :  but is making plans to increase its domestic military production.
*15:15.240- 15:20.920* :  The problem of ammunition shortages, particularly with artillery rounds,
*15:20.920- 15:26.780* :  will not go away. In the short term, Ukraine has decided to address this issue by increasing
*15:26.780- 15:31.860* :  the production of kamikaze drones. Next year, we have an agreement with the Netherlands
*15:31.980- 15:37.420* :  and they plan to provide 2 billion euros in support. As for the US,
*15:38.280- 15:42.700* :  the Congress is supposed to approve new funds. They haven't gone on a winter break yet
*15:43.280- 15:50.080* :  and are staying to solve the issue. So, we're confident that our partners will continue to assist
*15:50.080- 15:56.760* :  Ukraine. Mr Gavriliyuk was speaking to our correspondent in Ukraine, Abduzhelil Abduzilov.
*15:57.460- 16:02.520* :  In public, the Ukrainian authorities say that their confidence that their international
*16:02.520- 16:09.240* :  partners will continue providing military assistance as before. They are quite confident that
*16:09.680- 16:16.120* :  these bilateral deals with the European countries will carry on despite the fact that the major
*16:16.120- 16:22.260* :  50 billion aid package that the European Union pledged before has been blocked.
*16:22.300- 16:29.120* :  But also regarding this package, some EU officials and Germany's Chancellor,
*16:29.120- 16:34.560* :  all the shows office was quite optimistic and he said that the next, in January,
*16:34.560- 16:40.720* :  the EU will return to this issue. So, there is a lot of sense of optimism that these
*16:40.720- 16:46.260* :  aid packages and funds will be released both by the EU and the United States. However,
*16:46.740- 16:51.920* :  these are still really worrying times for Ukraine because this situation sends a signal
*16:51.920- 16:59.160* :  to Moscow that the international support for Ukraine is declining and therefore Russia becomes
*16:59.160- 17:04.560* :  more confident in its actions. It emboldens them to continue this war because they feel that
*17:04.560- 17:11.680* :  the victory is very close. And what is actually happening with the conflict? Is there a stalemate
*17:12.180- 17:18.460* :  as winter closes in? I've just come back from the front line and the feeling there, the mood
*17:18.460- 17:25.340* :  among the soldiers is that this stalemate will stay for quite a while. After the hyped
*17:26.600- 17:34.200* :  counter-offensive plans that Ukraine announced in the summer, the gains were incremental. The territorial
*17:34.200- 17:40.820* :  grains were incremental and therefore these soldiers now believe that these war will drag on
*17:40.820- 17:47.400* :  for much longer and therefore they think that this is the time when Ukraine needs assistance from
*17:47.400- 17:53.780* :  outside more than ever because in order to change this situation, this situation of the stalemate
*17:54.100- 18:00.020* :  and what they call the trench war and change the tide of this war, they need more support from
*18:00.020- 18:06.680* :  their western allies. And regarding the shortage of ammunition, they were saying that this situation
*18:06.680- 18:12.680* :  is so bad that they have to limit their fire. And many observers say that this war is the
*18:12.680- 18:19.360* :  wolf artillery. It is vital for troops to have artillery support. Without this, it will really
*18:19.360- 18:26.360* :  hurt both to defend and to launch any offensive actions. Abdul-Jalil Abdul-Aselov. A beauty
*18:26.360- 18:32.000* :  pageant in France has caused a storm on social media after judges awarded the title of Miss France
*18:32.000- 18:38.780* :  to a woman with short hair. This report from Rachel Wright. Miss France 2024.
*18:39.100- 18:49.580* :  And the rest will be Miss North Pakalais. The moment won 22-year-old Yves Gil from a small town
*18:49.580- 18:55.260* :  in the north part of the Kalle was crowned Miss France. She was awarded the title by an all female
*18:55.260- 19:01.240* :  panel of judges overriding the public vote, which put Miss Guyana and Miss Guadeloupe ahead.
*19:01.780- 19:06.520* :  The beauty pageant is still very popular in France with a peak viewing audience on Saturday night
*19:06.520- 19:12.700* :  of 9 million people. Yves Gil, sporting what's known as a pixie haircut, in other words very short,
*19:12.700- 19:18.820* :  is also very slim, almost and drudgingous. Earlier in the contest, she talked about her appearance.
*19:21.780- 19:25.040* :  No one can dictate who you are or who you want to be.
*19:27.120- 19:32.640* :  But moments after her win, social media platforms lit up with posts suggesting Miss Guyana
*19:32.640- 19:38.160* :  should have won, and Yves Gil was only awarded the title because of the wokeness of the judges,
*19:38.620- 19:45.660* :  and their desire to be inclusive overrode beauty. The hashtag Miss France 2024 started trending on
*19:45.660- 19:50.600* :  X, formerly known as Twitter, with some mean showing people bursting into tears and even pretending
*19:50.600- 19:56.980* :  to hang themselves. Yves Gil is the first contestant with short hair to win the 103-year-old contest,
*19:56.980- 20:03.180* :  all the other winners have had long-flowing hair and curvaceous figures. The organisers of the pageant
*20:03.180- 20:08.720* :  declared the decision a victory for diversity. Like other beauty contests, it's been the subject
*20:08.720- 20:14.840* :  of feminist attacks since the mid-1970s. Last year, it dropped the rules that required candidates
*20:14.840- 20:21.620* :  to be no older than 24, to be unmarried and child-free, and opened it up to transgender women.
*20:22.180- 20:27.280* :  But there are still rules for the competition. You must be at least 1.7 metres tall,
*20:27.280- 20:33.640* :  must pledge not to put on weight, change your hairstyle, or display tattoos or piercings during
*20:33.640- 20:36.680* :  your year-long reign. Rachel Wright reporting.
*20:39.580- 20:45.000* :  Still to come in this podcast, widespread flooding in the northern Australian state of Queensland.
*20:45.480- 20:49.440* :  We've seen people on roofs isolated, we've seen people actually waiting to be rescued.
*20:50.280- 20:53.560* :  Some of those have been removed and we still can't really have people out in the community who are
*20:53.920- 20:56.460* :  waiting to be evacuated from some of those locations.
*21:01.920- 21:04.960* :  Some people play golf on the weekends. I hunt con artists.

*21:36.260- 21:40.940* :  I'm Cassie Adler and today on the global story, I'll be taking a look at accusations of
*21:40.940- 21:46.300* :  anti-Semitism on college campuses in the United States amidst growing protests against
*21:46.300- 21:51.080* :  Israel's military action in Gaza. The resulting congressional hearing has caused an
*21:51.080- 21:56.520* :  uproar over free speech at US universities. The global story brings you fresh insights
*21:56.520- 22:00.000* :  and new perspectives from BBC experts around the world.

*22:11.800- 22:16.520* :  Next to Uganda, where human rights groups are challenging the country's anti-gay laws
*22:16.520- 22:20.180* :  in the Constitutional Court. The laws were passed earlier this year,
*22:20.500- 22:23.040* :  allowing for the death penalty in certain circumstances.
*22:23.400- 22:28.300* :  Gay activists say people have been arrested, beaten, and even tortured because of their sexual
*22:28.300- 22:33.140* :  orientation. I spoke to the BBC's Swybo Ibrahim, who was in court in Kampala.
*22:33.680- 22:38.540* :  Even before the passing of this law, we have known that the gay groups here in the country have
*22:38.540- 22:46.700* :  suffered from immense pressure and discrimination. So they argue that with the passing of the law,
*22:46.700- 22:53.280* :  it's going to exacerbate their situation here. And the earlier one I was speaking to Steven Cabu,
*22:53.280- 22:56.920* :  he's one of the gay community members here.
*22:57.420- 23:02.240* :  Since the law has passed, a lot of atrocities has happened to the LGBTQI plus community.
*23:02.300- 23:09.700* :  Many have been evicted, many have lost their jobs. Many have fled Uganda to refugee
*23:09.700- 23:16.100* :  camps around Uganda. I myself was attacked by a legion. Gay Ugandans are human beings.
*23:16.100- 23:18.860* :  That's why we have to call for equal human rights.
*23:19.200- 23:25.520* :  So basically, as you heard from the clip, this is the reason why the human rights
*23:25.520- 23:32.620* :  defendants in the country have come up to challenge the anti-homosexuality act.
*23:32.880- 23:38.120* :  Saying, arguing that it violates the fundamental rights of the Ugandans.
*23:39.200- 23:44.240* :  And their freedoms too, as I understand it. And what is the government's response to the legal
*23:44.240- 23:52.800* :  challenge? The government has remained distanced on its decision to ban the anti-homosexuality
*23:54.060- 23:59.780* :  acts in the country. And we see that because the president recently says that the countries
*24:00.540- 24:04.920* :  is not going to be shaken by the restrictions that have been imposed on. We know
*24:05.380- 24:10.220* :  that after the passing of the bill, the United States has come up with stringent measures,
*24:10.220- 24:14.580* :  including travel restrictions and banning the African country from the
*24:15.360- 24:21.100* :  ago, the African growth opportunity. And still, with this, the government remains the
*24:21.100- 24:26.180* :  stick to upholding the anti-homosexuality legislation.
*24:26.840- 24:32.380* :  And the laws were passed earlier this year, weren't they allowing, even for the death penalty
*24:32.380- 24:38.460* :  in certain circumstances? So what has happened to gay people in the country? Have they been
*24:38.460- 24:45.700* :  prosecuted? They haven't been any cases where people have been found guilty of involving themselves
*24:45.700- 24:54.000* :  in homosexuality activities. But as I spoke to one of the gay community members, he says they
*24:54.000- 24:59.860* :  continue to be persecuted. But in terms of bringing them before courts of law, it has rarely been
*24:59.860- 25:07.180* :  seen. Swayboo Ibrahim. Germany's far-right party, alternative for Germany, has been described by
*25:07.180- 25:11.880* :  the country's state intelligence service as an extremist group because of its Islamophobic,
*25:11.880- 25:17.740* :  anti-Semitic, and racist statements. But the party is growing in popularity. It's just had an
*25:17.740- 25:22.840* :  electoral breakthrough, winning its first mayoral election in the eastern state of Saxony.
*25:22.840- 25:28.420* :  Daemon McGinnis is the BBC's correspondent in Berlin. This is probably more of a symbolic win
*25:28.420- 25:33.780* :  more than anything else because Peirna, the town where the AFD won its first city mayor elections,
*25:33.780- 25:40.240* :  only has 38,000 inhabitants. But symbolically, across Germany, this is of major importance.
*25:40.340- 25:44.980* :  And that's because, own number of reasons. One is that Germany is facing key regional elections
*25:44.980- 25:51.400* :  across eastern Germany next year. And the AFD hopes that this may just start forward. The first time
*25:51.400- 25:56.140* :  it's got a city mayor position, which has tried a number of times what failed to do. But it hopes
*25:56.140- 26:01.100* :  that this would really provide a boost in already quite high poll numbers. What we're seeing right now
*26:01.100- 26:07.320* :  in Germany is the party as a whole across Germany gets about just over 20% of the vote. But in parts
*26:07.320- 26:12.500* :  of eastern Germany, it's more like over 30%, and the party hopes that it would become the strongest
*26:12.500- 26:17.860* :  party in those key regional elections this year. So I think what we're seeing as this mayoral
*26:17.860- 26:24.200* :  position really is more of a symbolic victory, which the party wants to build in rather than a
*26:24.200- 26:28.320* :  concrete political victory. But it is certainly symbolically very important. And how has it been
*26:28.320- 26:32.420* :  received in Germany? I think with a certain amount of shock. And I think also with lots of
*26:32.420- 26:39.340* :  analysis about how this happened. I think when you look at the political situation there in this
*26:40.100- 26:44.640* :  large tarot of Pierna, I think people are drawing lessons from that. And one of the lessons is that
*26:44.640- 26:50.000* :  this is a runoff vote, traditionally in other runoff votes, similarly where the AFD candidate was
*26:50.000- 26:55.820* :  about to become the mayor. Other parties have grouped together to fight off the AD. No other main street,
*26:55.820- 27:01.680* :  no other party in fact, will form a coalition with the AFD. The AFD is regional bits of the AFD
*27:01.680- 27:07.840* :  are defined as extremists. So what we've seen in Pierna is actually the opposite. What happened
*27:07.880- 27:14.320* :  is that the two other candidates did not come together. They fought on their own. And I think people
*27:14.320- 27:18.900* :  are looking at this saying that's a lesson, okay, how do you keep the AFD out of government, which
*27:18.900- 27:25.480* :  is a far right party and in part right wing extremist. And so I think political mainstream
*27:25.480- 27:30.080* :  actors and politicians harass themselves. What is their responsibility if they want to keep the AFD
*27:30.080- 27:35.300* :  out of power? The other question they're asking is if the AFD does win the most votes, whether it
*27:35.300- 27:40.560* :  be in a regional election, a local election or even in, you know, at some point maybe in the future
*27:40.560- 27:47.080* :  national election, how democratically and legitimately are you allowed to then still say you're
*27:47.080- 27:51.280* :  not going to work with that party. And I think those sorts of questions that people across
*27:51.280- 27:57.420* :  Germany are now asking themselves. Demi and McGinnis, in less than 48 hours the city of Keren's in
*27:57.420- 28:02.920* :  the state of Queensland in Northeastern Australia has experienced more than three times the average
*28:02.920- 28:08.160* :  rainfall for the whole of December. In the state's far north several tourist towns along the great
*28:08.160- 28:13.620* :  barrier reef have been cut off. While the worst of the rain has now passed hundreds of homes of
*28:13.620- 28:19.220* :  flooded and emergency services and our focusing efforts on reaching residents isolated in rural
*28:19.220- 28:24.060* :  communities. Steve Zombok is the Queensland Ambulance Services Deputy Commissioner.
*28:24.880- 28:28.840* :  The roads that are cut and our ability to access those presents a real danger, a real challenge,
*28:28.840- 28:33.880* :  not only to us as responders trying to get there, but the people themselves importantly in those
*28:33.880- 28:39.080* :  situations. We've seen people on roofs isolated, we've seen people actually waiting to be rescued.
*28:39.920- 28:43.200* :  Some of those have been removed and we still currently have people out in the community who are
*28:43.200- 28:49.460* :  waiting to be evacuated from some of those locations. Chris Tester is a journalist with the Australian
*28:49.460- 28:55.320* :  Broadcasting Corporation whose encarns. Look on Sunday it was one of the wettest days that many
*28:55.320- 29:00.600* :  far north Queensland locals have ever seen. And remember that this is a part of Australia that
*29:00.600- 29:06.520* :  receives huge totals of rainfall every wet season. So in the past week some areas have received
*29:06.520- 29:11.940* :  well over a meter, a meter and a half. The floodwaters have started to recede. There are some places
*29:11.940- 29:17.100* :  that are still cut off. You can't safely drive in there or drive in there at all. There are
*29:17.100- 29:22.880* :  some highway instead of crumbled. I heard a first-hand account from one person who was trapped in
*29:22.880- 29:28.460* :  their home from floodwaters. On Sunday woke up on Monday to see that their street was actually
*29:28.460- 29:33.940* :  dry and they made the comment that it was almost as though it had been a really bad dream. But in
*29:33.940- 29:39.080* :  actual fact many people in that suburb, which is a coastal suburb of cans, a very well-known
*29:39.080- 29:44.660* :  international tourist destination. Many people in those coastal areas have lost everything that
*29:44.660- 29:52.920* :  they own in their homes. And we are seeing extraordinary pictures of, for example, crocodiles popping
*29:52.920- 29:58.740* :  up in rain waters in the centre of town. We did have one crocodile that was actually a colleague
*29:58.740- 30:03.720* :  of mine who spotted that in a small town called Lingham, which is about two and a half hours
*30:04.620- 30:09.680* :  south of cans in agricultural town. This is one of the things that authorities are really
*30:09.680- 30:14.480* :  concerned about, is that people will venture out into flood water, be it, you know, in their boats,
*30:14.500- 30:19.740* :  in their tinnies or in their cars or even having a swim. And you just don't know what the risks are.
*30:20.160- 30:26.960* :  This is crocodile country. Crocodiles live in all parts of final of Queensland and with so much
*30:26.960- 30:31.440* :  floodwaters around, they might be on the move and people might start to see them popping up in places
*30:31.440- 30:37.340* :  that they wouldn't ordinarily expect to. And what about these tourist tans? You mentioned tourism
*30:37.340- 30:43.680* :  there along the Great Barrier Reef that have been cut off. What's the latest on those? Very difficult
*30:43.680- 30:49.420* :  to get, in fact, it's impossible to get into cans at the moment from other parts of Australia.
*30:49.420- 30:55.700* :  Flights are likely to resume on Tuesday, Australian time. So there are people either stuck in cans
*30:55.760- 31:00.860* :  who were due to leave or people who were due to arriving in cans and haven't been able to get
*31:01.100- 31:06.420* :  here. Already before this flooding, the tourism industry was talking of a $60 million
*31:06.460- 31:12.860* :  blow to the tourism economy. And that was just due to lost bookings and cancellations because of
*31:12.860- 31:18.980* :  the tropical cyclone. Chris Tester speaking to me from Cairns in Australia. And finally, a new
*31:18.980- 31:24.260* :  production of Macbeth, one of William Shakespeare's best known plays, has just opened in London.
*31:24.860- 31:29.700* :  It's not only the Doctor Who star, David Tennant in the title rule, who's drawing in the crowds,
*31:29.700- 31:35.460* :  but also the inventive use of sound technology. Judy Frankel has this report.
*31:44.980- 31:49.520* :  There have been many adaptations of the psychological drama of political ambition, love and murder.
*31:56.300- 32:01.360* :  The play begins with three witches telling Macbeth, a Scottish general, that he will be king.
*32:02.120- 32:07.200* :  Their prophecy turns him into a scheming murderer, who is then racked with guilt and paranoia.
*32:08.180- 32:13.180* :  The director of this production, Max Webster, said he wanted to find a new way of thinking about
*32:13.180- 32:18.180* :  Macbeth. I started from the idea that Macbeth is a soldier returning from war, and one of the things
*32:18.180- 32:23.600* :  I've learnt from working with various soldiers on previous productions is the incredible damage
*32:23.600- 32:28.080* :  to people's mental health that working in the army can create. So a huge number of soldiers
*32:28.080- 32:33.280* :  returning from war have PTSD with symptoms of psychosis. And I wondered if there was a way of
*32:33.280- 32:37.880* :  suggesting that Macbeth is coming back from war, and that rather than seeing three witches dancing
*32:37.880- 32:43.800* :  around a cauldron, he's experiencing some sort of mental difficulty and that the witches could
*32:43.800- 32:48.920* :  in a way be voices in his head. You don't see the witches on stage. Instead, their voices are
*32:48.920- 32:54.120* :  created using live and recorded sound that the audience hears through headphones. By an
*32:54.120- 32:58.900* :  oral technology, there's a microphone that represents the human ears. So just as you need two
*32:58.900- 33:04.360* :  eyes in order to perceive distance accurately, when you have two working ears, that means you can
*33:04.360- 33:09.340* :  spatialise sounds. And just as we heard now the door opened and we hear exactly where that is,
*33:09.660- 33:13.840* :  and we know that's two metres away and to my right, we can give a very clear and accurate
*33:13.840- 33:18.200* :  picture of where the sound is coming from. And so the wearing headphones and using a
*33:18.200- 33:23.340* :  by-and-all microphone means that all the sounds in the show aren't just stereo in your head,
*33:23.340- 33:28.000* :  but can actually become a 3D landscape of sound, allowing us to put the audience inside the heads
*33:28.000- 33:32.460* :  of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Shakespeare lends itself to creative and imaginative productions.
*33:33.360- 33:37.720* :  Video projections are now commonplace in the theatre, so why not more immersive sound?
*33:38.520- 33:42.200* :  The reviewers have all given this play a resounding thumbs up.
*33:42.580- 33:43.620* :  Judy Frankel reporting.
*33:45.920- 33:49.600* :  And that's it from us for now, but we'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
