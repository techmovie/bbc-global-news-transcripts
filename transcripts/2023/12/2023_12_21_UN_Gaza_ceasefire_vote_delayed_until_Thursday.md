*00:18.640- 00:24.500* :  Hello, I'm Katya Adler. Today on the Global Story, I'll be taking a look at what a ghost city in
*00:24.500- 00:30.080* :  Malaysia can tell us more broadly about China's economy. The Global Story brings you fresh
*00:30.080- 00:37.000* :  insights and new and at times surprising perspectives from BBC experts around the world. Find us wherever
*00:37.000- 00:38.520* :  you get your BBC podcasts.
*00:46.920- 00:50.580* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:53.200- 00:58.780* :  Hi, I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Thursday, the 21st of December, these are our main
*00:58.780- 01:05.820* :  stories. The US strikes a hopeful note despite a further delay to a crucial UN vote on a cease-fire in
*01:05.820- 01:10.480* :  Gaza. We're engaged in very good faith with other countries. We've been working this intensely.
*01:10.480- 01:14.860* :  I've been on the phones about this for the last couple of days, so I hope we can get to a good
*01:14.860- 01:20.080* :  place. That crunch vote is now expected on Thursday. Meanwhile, Hamas says the number of
*01:20.080- 01:26.460* :  Palestinians killed in Gaza since the war began as past 20,000. The US frees a top ally of
*01:26.460- 01:31.080* :  Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro in exchange for the release of dozens of prisoners,
*01:31.640- 01:38.320* :  and the artificial intelligence model can predict with astonishing accuracy people's life chances.
*01:38.680- 01:43.400* :  We actually look at the outcome for each single person and it's not quite life expectancy,
*01:43.400- 01:48.140* :  but rather is this person going to die within the next four years.
*01:51.300- 01:57.320* :  Also, in this podcast, Ireland takes a case against the UK government to the European Court of
*01:57.320- 02:03.740* :  Human Rights, and we speak to the head of the Santa Claus Postal Service. Every child's letter is
*02:03.740- 02:10.080* :  read that we try very hard to personalize the letter that we send out. How many letters are we
*02:10.080- 02:14.740* :  talking about? At the present moment, we're up to about 21,000 this year.
*02:19.300- 02:24.080* :  We start in New York, where, despite another day of intense diplomacy at the United Nations,
*02:24.080- 02:30.140* :  a crucial security council vote on a suspension of fighting in Gaza has been delayed for a third time.
*02:30.540- 02:34.820* :  Negotiations are continuing and the hope that the US will finally back a resolution,
*02:35.380- 02:40.020* :  which would also see more humanitarian aid reaching the people who desperately needed.
*02:40.600- 02:44.400* :  At a media briefing earlier, the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*02:44.400- 02:48.380* :  said Washington was still working to overcome outstanding issues.
*02:48.800- 02:52.620* :  We're engaged, as I said, in very good faith with other countries. We've been working
*02:52.620- 02:56.040* :  this intensely. I've been on the phones about this for the last couple of days.
*02:56.420- 02:59.300* :  Linda Thomas Greenfield, of course, in New York, has been leading our efforts,
*02:59.300- 03:01.600* :  so I hope we can get to a good place.
*03:01.900- 03:06.520* :  Anthony Blinken, Nedotorfic is in New York and gave me the latest from the UN.
*03:06.960- 03:11.020* :  We've actually heard from the UAE, which authored this draft resolution.
*03:11.220- 03:16.240* :  And look, they have said that the goal is to get a resolution that actually makes an impact
*03:16.240- 03:20.680* :  on the ground. And that's why they were willing to go forward with this vote,
*03:20.680- 03:26.080* :  even though all signals pointed to a US veto, because they weren't willing to water it down
*03:26.080- 03:31.460* :  any further. But we have just heard from the Ambassador, Lana Nasebe, the UAE,
*03:31.460- 03:36.000* :  and she said that there was a decision made at the highest levels in capitals with leverage
*03:36.000- 03:38.840* :  that they would give additional time for diplomacy.
*03:38.860- 03:44.500* :  What we're hearing now is that Egypt and the United States are going to engage directly
*03:44.540- 03:49.760* :  to try to work on this proposal for an aid monitoring mechanism.
*03:50.320- 03:54.160* :  Now, originally, the United States was uncomfortable with that proposal.
*03:54.700- 03:58.660* :  It's something that Anthony Blinken spoke about saying that he wants to ensure
*03:58.660- 04:02.080* :  that any mechanism wouldn't complicate aid getting in.
*04:02.620- 04:06.480* :  So it seems like negotiations are giving space for that to happen.
*04:06.480- 04:12.160* :  But it's unclear still if this will eventually lead to a security council resolution being
*04:12.160- 04:17.140* :  passed. How much weight does the outcome of this vote if it ever actually does take place
*04:17.140- 04:23.480* :  actually have? Look, I think it really matters what is in an eventual resolution as we discussed.
*04:24.100- 04:30.780* :  The United Nations wants to see more aid get in. So on one hand, trying to streamline that
*04:30.780- 04:36.600* :  process would be helpful. But if the fighting continues, they've already said the fighting has
*04:36.600- 04:43.020* :  stopped them from being able to deliver aid at scale in a meaningful way. So I think the first
*04:43.020- 04:47.460* :  hurdle is getting this resolution, seeing what's in it. The second one is getting it implemented
*04:47.460- 04:51.540* :  on the ground because the current security council resolution, which calls for humanitarian
*04:51.540- 04:55.460* :  pauses, isn't being implemented quite frankly, as we speak.
*04:55.580- 04:58.440* :  And briefly, what's the mood like that people think it's going to happen?
*04:58.840- 05:04.680* :  I've really seen the mood at the UN shift from optimism to really feeling like there was no hope
*05:04.680- 05:08.500* :  that the U.S. could come on board. And they're cautiously optimistic, I would say now.
*05:08.860- 05:15.020* :  Editorific in New York. On Wednesday, the leader of Hamas Ismail Hanei was in Egypt for talks,
*05:15.020- 05:20.000* :  but huge differences remain with Hamas insisting it'll only discuss a permanent cease-fire.
*05:20.400- 05:25.680* :  Israel rejects that and once humanitarian pauses. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground
*05:25.740- 05:31.420* :  in Gaza worsens. The Hamas government media office says more than 20,000 people have now been
*05:31.420- 05:37.660* :  killed since Israel began its war in response to the unprecedented October 7th assault from Gaza,
*05:38.120- 05:44.880* :  which left 1,200 people dead. Alex Tsar, the Colombian businessman and close associate of
*05:44.880- 05:51.560* :  Nicolas Maduro, must be an important man for the Venezuelan president. 10 Americans and 20
*05:51.560- 05:56.340* :  Venezuelans, among them political prisoners, were freed by the government in Caracas in
*05:56.340- 06:03.740* :  exchange for his release. Mr Tsar was extradited to the U.S. in 2021 after his arrest in Cape Verde
*06:03.740- 06:09.920* :  the previous year. He's accused of helping Venezuela evade U.S. sanctions and was charged with
*06:09.920- 06:15.920* :  money laundering. Washington has also secured the extradition from Venezuela of a fugitive known
*06:15.920- 06:22.340* :  fat Leonard, who's accused of bribing U.S. naval officials for classified material. Here's
*06:22.340- 06:25.680* :  Will Grant. Alex Tsar has long been an ally and cause
*06:25.680- 06:31.280* :  celebs for the Maduro administration. They say the Colombian businessman was unjustly arrested in
*06:31.280- 06:36.740* :  Cape Verde on a U.S. warrant in 2020. The U.S. government and the Venezuelan opposition say he was
*06:36.740- 06:41.440* :  the head of a multi-million dollar money laundering operation for President Maduro. However,
*06:41.440- 06:46.760* :  the Biden administration has now released Mr Tsar, an exchange for a number of Americans held in
*06:46.760- 06:51.980* :  Venezuela. There are currently at least 10 U.S. citizens in prison in Venezuela, including two
*06:51.980- 06:57.820* :  former Green Berets who took part in an attempt to oust Nicolas Maduro in 2019 and three others
*06:57.820- 07:02.980* :  accused of entering the country illegally from Colombia. The decision will no doubt infuriate Mr
*07:02.980- 07:07.920* :  Maduro's critics inside Venezuela and in Florida, where there is a large Venezuelan American
*07:07.920- 07:15.320* :  population. Will Grant. The Japanese car manufacturer Toyota has apologized and suspended the
*07:15.320- 07:21.400* :  export of all cars made by its subsidiary brand Dihatsu after an independent inspection found
*07:21.400- 07:27.100* :  that most models did not undergo appropriate safety tests. Suspissions arose earlier this year
*07:27.100- 07:33.520* :  that some tests dating back as far as 34 years ago had been rigged. Annie Green has more details.
*07:33.940- 07:40.160* :  Dihatsu is Toyota's small car brand, which is particularly popular in Japan. But in April,
*07:40.160- 07:46.700* :  it admitted falsifying crash test results involving door parts, which affected 88,000 vehicles.
*07:47.380- 07:52.340* :  A month later, it announced it was holding production of two hybrid vehicle models because of
*07:52.340- 07:57.340* :  similar irregularities. An investigation was launched, which has found that the first case of
*07:57.340- 08:06.200* :  misconduct went back as far as 1989. The independent panel has identified 174 new irregularities
*08:06.200- 08:13.400* :  across 64 models, including Toyota, Mazda and Subaru. The countries affected are in Southeast
*08:13.400- 08:18.520* :  Asia and Central and South America. In a news conference, the president of Dihatsu,
*08:18.540- 08:26.220* :  Richiro Akadaira, said sorry. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and concern we have
*08:26.220- 08:33.640* :  caused to our customers and other stakeholders. We apologise once again for betraying the trust of
*08:33.640- 08:40.040* :  our customers. Toyota, which is the world's biggest car maker, said it would carry out fundamental
*08:40.040- 08:47.260* :  reform. Annie Green, academics in Denmark have used artificial intelligence to predict people's
*08:47.260- 08:54.040* :  chances of ill health and death far more accurately than any existing model, using data that's not
*08:54.040- 09:00.240* :  principally health-related. As we'll hear shortly, its use in this way has both benefits and
*09:00.240- 09:06.380* :  pitfalls. But first, Sina Limon, a professor of complexity and network science at the technical
*09:06.380- 09:12.100* :  University of Denmark, told Tim Franks Moore about the AI he developed worked.
*09:12.380- 09:16.060* :  From a certain perspective, you can see a human life as a sequence of events.
*09:16.060- 09:22.460* :  You're born, you see a doctor, you go to the kindergarten, you start school, you meet someone
*09:22.980- 09:28.140* :  and so on. So from a perspective, you could see your life as one long sentence among many other
*09:28.140- 09:34.060* :  long sentences in other people's lives. But presumably you have to select those data points how
*09:34.060- 09:38.920* :  you're choosing them. And Denmark, we have Statistics Denmark, which collects very comprehensive
*09:38.920- 09:44.960* :  statistics on all the Danish citizens. So specifically, what we're looking at is from the labor
*09:44.960- 09:51.220* :  market data. It contains information about what's your job, where do you work in the country, how
*09:51.220- 09:56.160* :  much money do you make, what industry is it part of and so on. And then we also have some health data
*09:56.320- 10:01.000* :  about people's contact with the healthcare system. So when we make these predictions, they're not
*10:01.000- 10:06.040* :  in aggregate. We look at the outcome for each single person. And it's not quite life expectancy,
*10:06.040- 10:12.100* :  but rather is this person going to die within the next four years? Because that's the data that we
*10:12.100- 10:17.060* :  have access to. I think there are many things that this model should not be used for and could be
*10:17.060- 10:23.600* :  very problematic. But I think within healthcare, knowing about any disease early on means that you
*10:23.600- 10:27.800* :  can put in place prevention and that's better for everyone. It's costless money and it means that
*10:27.800- 10:32.960* :  fewer people suffer. So I think that's a use case where this could be really a positive model like
*10:32.960- 10:37.040* :  this. Potentially some amount of time and we've figured all that out, it could be amazing.
*10:37.340- 10:41.980* :  But you also hinted at where you would not like this to end up tell me about that side of things.
*10:42.300- 10:46.720* :  Insurance is based on sharing risk that we don't know what's going to happen so we share the risk
*10:47.060- 10:51.120* :  together. And with a model like this, essentially you could undermine the whole idea of insurance.
*10:51.320- 10:55.900* :  That's a very clear example where nobody would like this because if you're the kind of the
*10:55.900- 11:00.560* :  unlucky person with some latent disease that could be spotted, then you would have to carry that burden
*11:01.840- 11:07.940* :  Sooner, Lehman, Professor of Complexity and Network Science at the Technical University of Denmark.
*11:09.060- 11:15.200* :  Mummy, Water or the Fari one is the latest offering from Nigeria's booming film industry
*11:15.640- 11:20.600* :  and it's making waves around the world. The black and white fantasy thriller loosely based on
*11:20.600- 11:26.720* :  West African folklore as one rave reviews and awards. It could even be nominated for an Oscar.
*11:27.240- 11:28.240* :  Dan Thomas has more.
*11:36.880- 11:42.520* :  Mummy, Water or Mother Water is a spirit from African folklore celebrated for its healing powers
*11:42.520- 11:47.240* :  and promotion of fertility. It's also the loose inspiration for CJ Abassi's groundbreaking
*11:47.240- 11:51.660* :  new thriller which has already picked up an award for cinematography at this year's Sundance
*11:51.660- 11:56.740* :  Film Festival. The highly stylus film focuses on a Nigerian village that has rejected
*11:56.740- 12:01.860* :  modern life to follow a faith healer who claims she represents the water spirit. The death of a
*12:01.860- 12:07.580* :  child will lead to upheaval and eventually violence. So what inspired the director CJ Abassi to make
*12:07.580- 12:14.060* :  the film? I would say a need to see a new kind of African cinema. It's a very specific visual
*12:14.060- 12:19.880* :  language. It's a very specific narrative about our spirituality, about our culture, about our
*12:19.880- 12:25.340* :  tradition. Also a very specific perspective as far as how we depict the things that have been
*12:25.340- 12:31.440* :  demonized about our cultural practices and about our belief systems. Mummy, Water deities are part
*12:31.440- 12:36.420* :  of a spiritual belief system that predates Christianity and Islam as a two dominant religions in
*12:36.420- 12:41.760* :  West Africa today. But Abassi says not everyone was happy about him making a film that celebrated
*12:41.760- 12:47.900* :  traditional customs. We had very severe pushback, just even saying that we wanted to make a film about
*12:48.140- 12:53.960* :  was extremely controversial. That alone was enough motivation to keep going.
*12:59.920- 13:03.720* :  Abassi said he filmed in black and white because it allowed him to break new ground in the way
*13:03.720- 13:08.580* :  dark skin could be captured on screen. Black and white allowed us to really push boundaries
*13:08.580- 13:15.800* :  and what people say you can do with dark skin at night especially. There's a symbol behind
*13:16.000- 13:22.840* :  centering the dark skin in the narrative and having them envision as these multi-dimensional
*13:22.840- 13:29.100* :  characters, gods and creatures with complexity rather than just caricature characters as we often
*13:29.100- 13:35.160* :  see in various depictions of African cinema. The film is one rave reviews and being chosen as Nigeria's
*13:35.160- 13:39.500* :  entry for consideration in the international feature film category of this year's Oscars.
*13:39.820- 13:43.820* :  The nominations will be announced later in December. The movie is being seen as confirmation
*13:43.880- 13:49.160* :  of the quality of Nigeria's booming film industry. Abassi accepts the Oscars remain a Western
*13:49.160- 13:54.000* :  centric phenomenon but he says being nominated could help bring Nigerian cinema to a global audience.
*13:54.180- 13:59.800* :  Cinema knows no boundaries. Cinema tabs into the shared human experience. I would say more than
*14:00.100- 14:05.760* :  any other art form. I think I have the potential to reach a strong audience in Nigeria because
*14:05.760- 14:08.980* :  I do make my films to be accessible for everyone.
*14:09.600- 14:13.120* :  CJ Abassi ending that report by Dan Thomas.
*14:15.680- 14:18.320* :  Still to come in the Global News podcast.
*14:18.860- 14:23.920* :  By receiving an income for the nuts that they collect and gather from the rainforest,
*14:23.920- 14:30.140* :  they have no incentive to cut the trees down and log it for other forms of income.
*14:30.540- 14:36.860* :  A special report on the importance of Brazil nut farmers to the preservation of the Amazon rainforest.
*14:44.860- 14:50.680* :  Let's return to our main story and the delaying once again of the UN Security Council vote on
*14:50.680- 14:55.440* :  Gaza. It's been pushed back to Thursday in the hope that an agreement can be reached to
*14:55.440- 15:00.580* :  avoid the US from vetoing it for a third time. The vast majority of countries want to cease
*15:00.580- 15:07.320* :  fire but the US and Israel support the resumption of a humanitarian pause in exchange for hostages.
*15:07.320- 15:12.960* :  The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the barrier to this happening depended on whether
*15:12.960- 15:17.220* :  Hamas would stick to its commitments. On the question of hostages and a pause,
*15:17.400- 15:22.020* :  this is something we very much like to see happen. Israel has been very clear that it would welcome
*15:22.380- 15:26.380* :  returning to pause in the further release of hostages. The problem remains Hamas.
*15:26.760- 15:31.020* :  They reneged on commitments that they made during the first pause for hostages releases.
*15:31.380- 15:35.160* :  The question is whether they are in fact willing to resume this effort.
*15:35.780- 15:41.380* :  Anthony Blinken. While the fate of the kidnapped hostages dominates proceedings at the UN,
*15:41.380- 15:47.080* :  questions have been raised about the Palestinians taken prisoner in Gaza by the Israeli army.
*15:47.440- 15:52.960* :  Palestinian campaigner Mustafa Buguti told Sarah Montague that Palestinians who were released
*15:53.000- 15:57.540* :  from a detention centre in southern Israel say they were tortured there.
*15:57.880- 16:03.980* :  They told me they were kept more than 1000 people in detention or concentration camp
*16:04.320- 16:10.140* :  near Birjava and they were beaten badly. They were tortured with different methods.
*16:10.140- 16:16.460* :  Some people were hit with electrical shocks. They also used drowning their heads in the water
*16:16.460- 16:22.580* :  while they were interrogating them intensively for hours. They are kept in a place which is very cold.
*16:22.580- 16:28.520* :  They don't have enough clothes and the food they are given is very little but the most
*16:28.520- 16:33.540* :  important thing that a number of prisoners that they witnessed died because of the beating and
*16:33.540- 16:37.260* :  torture. Some of them were people who had diseases like heart diseases.
*16:37.660- 16:42.120* :  Those are very serious allegations. If you use the words concentration camp the suggestion
*16:42.200- 16:45.940* :  that they are being tortured. What evidence do you have?
*16:46.120- 16:51.520* :  The evidence is what the prisoners told us. They have shown their hands which were handcuffed
*16:51.520- 16:56.720* :  for very long time. They showed the scars and bruises. One of the persons I spoke to is a
*16:56.720- 17:03.040* :  first aid provider and he showed that he had two ribs fractured and that was confirmed by X-3.
*17:03.280- 17:07.480* :  One of the prisoners being tortured is the director of the Shefaz.
*17:07.700- 17:12.220* :  Did you see what you're talking about first hand? You saw these people in front of you.
*17:12.440- 17:15.760* :  I saw a video of them because I am not in Gaza. I am in the West Bank.
*17:15.880- 17:19.000* :  They have gone back to Gaza and you saw video exactly.
*17:19.500- 17:24.620* :  I talked to them personally by phone but they sent the video during an interview with one of the
*17:24.620- 17:30.280* :  TV channels. I think the best solution is to send an international independent commission or
*17:30.280- 17:37.320* :  the Red Cross to go and visit that place. The International Committee of the Red Cross
*17:37.320- 17:42.200* :  issued a statement saying it's not been given access to the prisoners by the Israeli authorities
*17:42.640- 17:45.880* :  and is therefore unable to monitor their conditions or treatment.
*17:45.900- 17:50.920* :  Mark Regev is a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*17:51.360- 17:54.480* :  How does he respond to the allegations of torture?
*17:54.800- 17:59.700* :  I reject them. The Israeli authorities work in accordance with the international law.
*17:59.700- 18:03.840* :  Our Supreme Court has ruled torture is illegal in Israel.
*18:03.840- 18:09.780* :  Anyone involved in torturing prisoners would be open to judicial interference so they could be
*18:09.780- 18:13.660* :  arrested. They could face trial. It's simply illegal in Israel according to our law.
*18:13.800- 18:18.020* :  Will you let the Red Cross in to this prison to see what's going on there?
*18:18.260- 18:22.760* :  You raise a very good question. I have to tell you the following. It was routine for Red Cross
*18:22.760- 18:28.100* :  people to visit Palestinian prisoners. We've suspended that because Hamas has refused to allow
*18:28.100- 18:33.840* :  the Red Cross to visit the hostages. As you know, there are over 100 Israeli hostages still being
*18:33.840- 18:39.580* :  held in Gaza and the question is when Hamas refuses to allow visits of Red Cross to our people
*18:39.580- 18:45.240* :  should we be allowing them to visit theirs. Do you not hold yourself to a higher standard than that?
*18:45.240- 18:49.480* :  Of course we do. Of course we do. But we have to use the leverage we have.
*18:49.800- 18:52.900* :  There are issues of timing. If we're talking to our people who've just been arrested,
*18:52.900- 18:58.820* :  just being captured in conflict, Israel will abide by international law. We will continue to do so.
*18:58.940- 19:01.940* :  The Palestinians are suggesting there are more than a thousand people there,
*19:02.320- 19:05.880* :  including the director of our chief of hospital and say they are being tortured.
*19:06.200- 19:10.160* :  I understand, but let me explain. When you say the head of our chief of hospital is being held,
*19:10.420- 19:14.240* :  your list does not presume he's like the head of their local hospital. The head of our chief of
*19:14.240- 19:18.640* :  hospital is a senior Hamas official. He knew everything about the underground tunnels.
*19:18.840- 19:22.660* :  He knew everything about Hamas using the hospitals as shield for the Hamas's war machine.
*19:22.660- 19:27.660* :  He knew about the Israeli hostages that were taken there to the hospital. He knows how Hamas
*19:28.020- 19:32.800* :  use and abuse them. So what is the answer? So the answer to the Red Cross access is what?
*19:33.120- 19:37.180* :  No. It will happen in due course in accordance with international law.
*19:37.500- 19:43.700* :  Mark Reghev speaking to Sarah Montague. Britain says it profoundly regrets an Irish government
*19:43.700- 19:49.320* :  decision to mount a legal challenge to a law that gives conditional amnesty for crimes committed
*19:49.320- 19:55.320* :  during three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland. London said the case was unnecessary and
*19:55.320- 20:00.700* :  came at a particularly sensitive time for the province. Dublin argues that the legislation
*20:00.700- 20:06.160* :  offering amnesty to former soldiers, police and paramilitaries in return for cooperation
*20:06.200- 20:13.080* :  violates the European Convention of Human Rights. Ireland correspondent Sarah Given told me
*20:13.080- 20:18.880* :  how the case came about. It's been a really long process to get to this point. You know these
*20:18.880- 20:25.300* :  legacy propositions were first brought by Boris Johnson's government back in 2021 and he said at
*20:25.300- 20:30.960* :  the time that it was a bid to draw a line under the troubles in Northern Ireland. The troubles
*20:30.960- 20:37.620* :  was a 30 year conflict that claimed more than three and a half thousand lives in Northern Ireland.
*20:37.960- 20:44.900* :  And what this new law does brings to an end all new inquests and civil actions related to the
*20:44.900- 20:50.240* :  troubles. Now it was very controversial at the time, opponents who have included victims,
*20:50.240- 20:55.700* :  groups, stormants, parties and the government of the Republic of Ireland. They all argue that this
*20:55.700- 21:01.920* :  removes access to justice for people and affects their human rights. But despite all that
*21:01.920- 21:08.220* :  opposition, the legacy act did become law in September. Victims and survivors have already
*21:08.220- 21:13.160* :  taken the government to court in Belfast and there had been pressure building for quite some
*21:13.200- 21:18.800* :  time now on the Irish government to take a case in Europe. And today it announced that it was
*21:18.800- 21:23.740* :  doing just that. Now we did hear from the Deputy Irish Prime Minister, the Tonista,
*21:23.820- 21:29.660* :  Martin. He said the Irish government had serious human rights concerns about this law.
*21:30.160- 21:34.880* :  And he added that the action they've now taken was taken regretfully, but the Irish government felt
*21:34.880- 21:39.920* :  it had no other choice but to do so. The critics essentially say that this law really gives
*21:39.920- 21:44.960* :  an amnesty to killers. They've got a point, haven't they? That totally depends on what side
*21:44.960- 21:50.760* :  of things are coming from. I suppose there's not much that unites political parties in Northern
*21:50.760- 21:57.040* :  Ireland, but the opposition to this legacy action by the government really did just that.
*21:57.040- 22:02.560* :  We had nationalist Republicans and unionists from all political persuasions in Northern Ireland
*22:02.560- 22:10.100* :  all coming together to say that this legislation was wrong, that it was anti-victim. And as I
*22:10.100- 22:14.700* :  say, there is another court case at the minute taken by those victims and survivors going through
*22:14.700- 22:20.380* :  the courts here in Belfast and that is still ongoing. So now we have legal action in Belfast
*22:20.500- 22:25.780* :  and in Strasbourg against the UK government. Our Ireland correspondent Sarah Gervin.
*22:26.660- 22:32.580* :  Bolivia is the world's biggest exporter of Brazil nuts producing three quarters of all global
*22:32.580- 22:38.520* :  trade. The nuts are also one of the few sustainable non-timber products that come from the
*22:38.520- 22:44.040* :  Amazon rainforest, but the industry is facing some challenges as Jane Chambers reports.
*22:47.160- 22:52.180* :  The hot and humid Amazon rainforest in the Pando region of Northern Bolivia is where the vast
*22:52.180- 22:57.480* :  majority of Brazil nuts are grown in the world with no pesticides. Harvesting the produce
*22:57.700- 23:03.680* :  isn't for the faint-hearted. In November and December the nuts start to fall from the trees
*23:03.940- 23:10.460* :  and it's dangerous. When the wind starts you have to take cover because if you get struck by one
*23:10.460- 23:17.760* :  it can kill you. To get to the nuts workers use a machete to split the hard out of the shell
*23:17.760- 23:24.420* :  which is known as a pod and looks a bit like a coconut. It's the rainy season so as well as using
*23:24.420- 23:30.180* :  machetes to get the nuts we need them to kill the snakes which are around at this time of the year
*23:30.180- 23:36.520* :  and invited. Juan Carlos is one of 15,000 people who work in Bolivia's Brazil nuts sector.
*23:36.840- 23:43.040* :  Nut collectors earn around $390 a month which is a good wage but that varies depending on the
*23:43.040- 23:49.080* :  international market and the work seasonal. River Alters are bustling city in the Benny region
*23:49.340- 23:53.840* :  next door to the Pando region where the nuts are gathered and sent by truck to one of the many
*23:53.840- 24:00.240* :  processing plants here. I'm off to have a tour. That's the sound of mountains of nuts coming down
*24:00.240- 24:05.260* :  a metal funnel and there are different plastic boxes in front of us where they're being sorted
*24:05.300- 24:09.660* :  so you've got the whole ones in one, the ones that are slightly broken in others.
*24:10.760- 24:15.920* :  El Sabedis is the Associate Director at Free World Trading, a UK and Europe-based company
*24:15.920- 24:20.800* :  which buys nuts from around the world. She's a product manager for Brazil Nut Kernels
*24:21.080- 24:26.200* :  and has been visiting River Alters for the last 10 years. There's a big drive over the past
*24:26.200- 24:32.980* :  couple of years from the export market mainly in Europe to look below processor level about
*24:32.980- 24:37.240* :  the provenance, where does the product come from, who are the communities that source our nuts
*24:37.240- 24:42.820* :  and how are they are working conditions and we see a real growing demand from them to get a
*24:42.820- 24:48.340* :  supply chain what we call field to forks. Despite working conditions improving, for some volatile
*24:48.340- 24:54.360* :  prices are an issue. Nut producer Jorge Henzel says for the past few years it's been impossible
*24:54.360- 25:02.040* :  to make money from the harvest. It costs native olivianos which is around $13 to get the box
*25:02.040- 25:07.940* :  of Brazil nuts from the forest to the processing plant and that represent a loss for us because
*25:08.240- 25:13.320* :  supposedly the prices in the international market have fallen and now we can't cover our costs.
*25:13.320- 25:19.040* :  No se da mi pasacar el cost operativo. Elsa thinks that keeping prices stable and raising awareness
*25:19.040- 25:25.640* :  about Brazil nuts is vital for the market. It has a huge importance on the livelihood of the people
*25:25.640- 25:30.920* :  that live particularly in northern Bolivia and also on the protection of the Amazon because by
*25:30.920- 25:37.200* :  receiving an income for the nuts that they collect and gather from the rainforest they have no
*25:37.460- 25:44.080* :  incentive to cut the trees down and log it for other forms of income to I don't know for cattle
*25:44.080- 25:49.240* :  for soya so it really gives them a reason to care for the forest. She says that the world needs to
*25:49.240- 25:55.400* :  recognize that the Brazil nut producers are the guardians of the Amazon rainforest. Jane Chambers
*25:55.400- 26:02.140* :  reporting there from Bolivia and you can hear more of that report on business daily from the BBC
*26:02.140- 26:09.480* :  World Service. In the American Midwest is Santa Claus a town that is in the state of Indiana.
*26:09.480- 26:15.440* :  It has a population of around two and a half thousand so there's a post office which unsurprisingly
*26:15.440- 26:21.380* :  receives thousands of letters addressed to Father Christmas from near and far and going back a very
*26:21.380- 26:28.200* :  long way. The people of Santa Claus make every effort to ensure each letter gets a reply if possible.
*26:28.200- 26:34.920* :  Many volunteers are involved and they're led by Pat Coch who's 92 and has spent much of her life
*26:34.920- 26:41.540* :  responding to children. She told my colleague Evan Davis how it works. Our volunteers come in. We
*26:41.540- 26:47.280* :  start answering letters by sitting down at the table. We have four farm letters with different
*26:47.280- 26:54.780* :  messages and every child's letter is read. Then we try to find the right farm letter that suits
*26:54.780- 27:02.120* :  that child. There is one that says sometimes we cannot give you everything you want which is for
*27:02.120- 27:09.540* :  a child who sends two pages of what you want or pictures of hundreds of things and there's one
*27:09.540- 27:15.780* :  called dear little friend which is for a smaller child that's just learning to write and so the
*27:15.780- 27:23.300* :  child's name goes into the salutation which is dear Johnny, dear Susie and the name and a comma
*27:23.600- 27:28.980* :  and then at the bottom of the letter a statement is made concerning what was said in the letter.
*27:29.060- 27:35.340* :  For instance, I'm trying hard in school. Thank you so much for trying hard in school. I'm so proud
*27:35.340- 27:41.700* :  of you for what you're doing. I loved your art on your letter. We never mention a toy or anything
*27:41.700- 27:48.280* :  they're asking for. We try very hard to personalize the letter that we send out. We really,
*27:48.280- 27:54.900* :  really do try hard. How many letters are we talking about? We're up to about 21,000 this year.
*27:55.260- 28:01.780* :  You have so many letters coming in. You must see all of life in these letters, all of children's life
*28:01.820- 28:08.120* :  in these letters. We do. We receive letters that are so funny and so many children this year are
*28:08.120- 28:14.380* :  asking that we help children in need which is wonderful and the homeless but we also get letters
*28:14.380- 28:20.720* :  from depressed people. People who say they just are so depressed and so sad and don't know how they'll
*28:20.720- 28:25.840* :  make it through Christmas. People that are in jail that want us to send a letter to a child,
*28:25.840- 28:31.160* :  you know, family troubles. They help my family. This Christmas to get along and have a good
*28:31.660- 28:38.880* :  Christmas. So we laugh, we cry, we commiserate with one another. We just do letters. We can't give
*28:39.440- 28:48.860* :  money or boxes or anything because our postage is 12 to 18,000 every year for how much postage we
*28:48.860- 28:55.540* :  have but it's a work of love and we do it all completely free. Christmas elf Pat Cox speaking to
*28:55.540- 29:01.660* :  Evan Davis. It's one of the busiest weeks of the year for British theatres with the festive
*29:01.660- 29:06.500* :  season in full swing. After coming to a virtual stand still because of the pandemic,
*29:06.500- 29:12.140* :  there's a pact with shows and pantomimes doing a roaring trade. But there's something else
*29:12.140- 29:18.360* :  happening too. Critics and industry experts say that while standing evations used to be a rarity,
*29:18.920- 29:25.000* :  in recent years they're happening more than ever. Our culture reporter Nure Nange has been
*29:25.000- 29:36.320* :  finding out why. A show in London's West End. The last song ends. And people jump up.
*29:38.180- 29:43.180* :  Pretty much everyone is on their feet and this is not a one-off. Here at the choir of man,
*29:43.460- 29:46.720* :  they say they've been seeing standing evations most nights of the week.
*29:49.560- 29:53.820* :  Did you give a standing evasion? Absolutely, yeah. Why did you give one? It's just a great show
*29:53.820- 29:58.200* :  and I think it just shows appreciation. Did you keep on in the standing evasion? Yes, yes.
*29:58.200- 30:03.660* :  Yes. And did you just go along with it? Peer pressure. No, no, no, no, you're just in your sweat
*30:03.660- 30:08.820* :  along with it, aren't you? The show's producer, Brian Hook, says audience responses have changed
*30:08.820- 30:13.760* :  in recent years. There's been so many more standing evations, especially since the pandemic,
*30:13.760- 30:17.220* :  I see it so much more in our shows and in other shows I go to as well.
*30:17.320- 30:19.220* :  With one look.
*30:23.200- 30:28.160* :  A few roads away at sunset Boulevard, starring the American singer Nicole Scherzinger,
*30:28.840- 30:33.620* :  audiences have even been getting to their feet during the show. And it's not just in London.
*30:35.460- 30:37.960* :  It's been seen at Evita at the Lester Curve.
*30:39.540- 30:44.660* :  Sinder Reller at the Liverpool Everyman. The Lionel Witch and the Wardrobe at Birmingham Rap.
*30:45.420- 30:47.960* :  And two one-foot at the home-out in Manchester.
*30:49.320- 30:53.620* :  Theatre critic Lynn Gardner believes there are a number of reasons why it's happening.
*30:53.960- 31:00.620* :  I think standing evations breed standing evations. So whereas a standing ovation was perhaps
*31:00.620- 31:06.180* :  a barometer in the past of when you had seen something really extraordinary,
*31:06.220- 31:12.280* :  when the standing ovation becomes ubiquitous, the danger is that it becomes meaningless.
*31:12.900- 31:15.080* :  And where do you think that this trend has come from?
*31:15.540- 31:21.180* :  It's probably initially has come from Broadway and from America, but I think when people
*31:21.180- 31:28.680* :  have shared out quite a lot of money that the standing ovation creates kind of a feel-good
*31:28.680- 31:35.580* :  factor and that people want to, in a sense, persuade themselves that they've had a really,
*31:35.580- 31:39.880* :  really good time, rather than just an okay time.
*31:39.880- 31:46.340* :  Once upon a time, there was a place far from here.
*31:46.580- 31:50.460* :  At Bristol Ulfig, a Christmas show, Arabian Nights, is underway.
*31:51.780- 31:57.720* :  This theatre built in 1766 knows a thing or two about changing audience behaviour.
*31:58.860- 32:03.820* :  Autistic director Nancy Medina says they're seeing more standing ovation in recent years.
*32:03.980- 32:07.760* :  People want to show their appreciation for the work that they've just seen in different ways.
*32:08.400- 32:10.220* :  So a lot of people are standing to their feet.
*32:10.220- 32:13.580* :  And if they're not standing up, are there other ways in which they show their appreciation?
*32:14.040- 32:19.300* :  Definitely, I mean, there's the nice polite clapping. There's the big ol' over your head clapping
*32:19.300- 32:21.340* :  and there's boopin' and hollering and whistling.
*32:23.820- 32:29.100* :  One of the cast of Arabian Nights, Syka Ahmed, says he isn't worried whether or not people
*32:29.100- 32:30.280* :  stand up at the end.
*32:30.460- 32:34.420* :  We've got to be really careful that we don't become snobbs about theatre etiquette.
*32:34.900- 32:41.600* :  You know, we don't want fights breaking out or people heckling. Generally, we just want people engaged.
*32:44.180- 32:49.120* :  Meanwhile, back at the choir of Man, the standing ovation is still going on.
*32:53.000- 32:54.740* :  Nuh-Nanji with that report.
*32:58.180- 33:04.200* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:04.740- 33:09.500* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and the producer was Emma Joseph.
*33:09.880- 33:11.940* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*33:12.440- 33:15.000* :  I'm Alex Ritzon and until next time, goodbye.
*33:25.740- 33:31.500* :  Hello, I'm Katya Adler. Today, on the Global Story, I'll be taking a look at what a ghost city in
*33:31.500- 33:37.100* :  Malaysia can tell us more broadly about China's economy. The Global Story brings you fresh
*33:37.100- 33:42.680* :  insights and new and at times surprising perspectives from BBC experts around the world.
