*01:12.600- 01:15.140* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:17.820- 01:21.340* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 5th of December, these are our main
*01:21.340- 01:27.040* :  stories. A cautious response from Washington to Israel's latest military action in southern Gaza.
*01:27.320- 01:31.600* :  The Secretary was very clear about how we want to judge this based on results, not based on intent.
*01:31.600- 01:36.560* :  I will say we've seen a much more targeted request for evacuations here, so that is an improvement
*01:36.560- 01:42.040* :  on what's happened before. We get the latest on the COP28 climate talks in Dubai where the events
*01:42.040- 01:47.180* :  president is back on the defensive, and should one of the farmers at the centre of America's
*01:47.180- 01:55.460* :  opioid crisis be shielded from future lawsuits. Also in this podcast, Sweden is one of the
*01:55.460- 02:00.560* :  hot spots for gun violence in Europe at the moment, and what we're seeing now is that various types
*02:00.560- 02:06.540* :  of homemade explosives are being used. We have a special report on the rise of gang violence in Sweden,
*02:07.020- 02:12.420* :  and twice the size of London and heading away from Antarctica, the massive iceberg on the loose.
*02:17.760- 02:22.640* :  The U.S. State Department has given a cautious welcome to Israel's new initiative to warn
*02:22.640- 02:28.140* :  civilians and Gaza of impending attacks. It said it was too soon to say whether Israeli forces
*02:28.140- 02:33.520* :  were fully-heeding American advice to protect civilians caught up in its renewed offensive against
*02:33.520- 02:39.180* :  Hamas. But it did say that the Israelis seem to be making more targeted requests for civilians
*02:39.180- 02:44.440* :  to flee Israeli targets in the south of the Gaza Strip. Matthew Miller is a State Department
*02:45.460- 02:50.580* :  gets too early to make a definitive assessment. I will say that in the first few days of this
*02:50.620- 02:54.840* :  military campaign against the south, we have seen some things that don't look like the operation
*02:54.840- 02:59.920* :  as it was conducted in the north, for example, in the north at the commencement of operations. You
*02:59.920- 03:05.400* :  saw them ask or order more than a million people to move, and we've seen a much more targeted
*03:05.400- 03:10.460* :  request for evacuations here. So that is an improvement on what's happened before. Israel has
*03:10.460- 03:15.820* :  reiterated that it's doing everything possible to minimize civilian casualties. This is the leader
*03:15.820- 03:21.680* :  of the opposition labor party, Merev Mikhaili, stalking to the BBC about how the Israeli defence forces,
*03:21.680- 03:28.020* :  the IDF, is waging its offensive. We are very meticulous in working according to humanitarian
*03:28.020- 03:34.880* :  international law, and we are really doing our best to warn the population and to work as carefully
*03:34.880- 03:42.000* :  as we possibly can in such a crowded area, which is being abused by Hamas to establish its terror
*03:42.000- 03:50.680* :  base within this population. We cannot accept living with this threat on our border.
*03:51.640- 03:57.420* :  Well, Israel has now issued a map of Gaza that identifies which places are not safe. On Monday,
*03:57.420- 04:03.920* :  it showed six northern and central areas of Khan units, where it said an estimated 167,000 people
*04:03.920- 04:09.640* :  needed to leave. So how is the new approach going down with civilians on the receiving end?
*04:10.100- 04:14.880* :  Muhammad Ghallaini from the English city of Manchester had traveled to Gaza to visit his family,
*04:14.880- 04:22.560* :  he's now trapped in Khan units. I'm in block 103 of Israel's supposed map of designated
*04:22.560- 04:28.140* :  safe and unsafe areas. For the past 15 minutes, there's been a succession of massive bombardments
*04:28.140- 04:37.660* :  ranging from 500 meters away to a kilometer or two, and each time the block shakes, it shakes
*04:37.660- 04:41.840* :  as in in an earthquake and I've been in earthquakes. There was another one just now.
*04:42.160- 04:49.180* :  Our block, as far as I was aware, this morning is not on the list. I left my home in Gaza City
*04:49.180- 04:55.400* :  on the 7th of October. I've been in five places since then. Two of those places are
*04:55.400- 05:02.440* :  damaged beyond repair. So certain death, if I stayed there, we have nowhere left to go. I have
*05:02.440- 05:07.580* :  40 people staying with me at my late grandparents' house in Khan units. Muhammad Ghallaini there.
*05:08.200- 05:13.640* :  Paul Adams is our correspondent in Jerusalem. How important is it for Israel to keep its main
*05:13.640- 05:18.360* :  backer the US on side? I mean, it's important, obviously, first of all, to try and do precisely
*05:18.360- 05:24.280* :  that, to minimize the number of civilians you kill. And as you've been hearing already, people are
*05:24.280- 05:29.600* :  not entirely sure where they should go to when they receive these orders to leave those areas,
*05:29.600- 05:34.980* :  designated as danger areas. And as you also heard, people have been told to move so many times now
*05:34.980- 05:40.760* :  that they are just exhausted. But it's also important for Israel to be seen by its principal ally,
*05:40.760- 05:46.340* :  the United States, to be heeding its advice. Because if and when the United States becomes tired
*05:46.340- 05:52.260* :  of this campaign, that will be the moment at which Israel is asked to rein itself in. And given
*05:52.260- 05:57.720* :  the fact that they still have significant tasks ahead of them, they want free reign to continue
*05:57.720- 06:02.920* :  to be able to operate throughout the Gaza Strip for probably months to come. So they know they do
*06:02.920- 06:07.260* :  have to heed American advice. And at the moment, as you've just been hearing from the State Department,
*06:07.260- 06:11.300* :  the jury is slightly out as to whether they are. Paul Adams in Jerusalem.
*06:11.900- 06:17.700* :  The president of the UN Climate Conference in the United Arab Emirates has dismissed reports
*06:17.700- 06:22.900* :  that he said there was no science proving the need to phase out fossil fuels. In our recent global
*06:22.900- 06:28.780* :  news podcast, we reported on reaction to the video published by the Guardian newspaper here in the UK
*06:28.780- 06:35.060* :  of Sultan and Jabbar making the comments at a live online event two weeks ago. Our climate editor,
*06:35.060- 06:41.340* :  Justin Rollert reports on another day of drama in Dubai. Sultan Al Jabbar did not hide his irritation
*06:41.340- 06:47.160* :  at the way his remarks have been reported. He was asked by the former Irish president Mary Robinson,
*06:47.160- 06:53.080* :  whether he was ready to commit to phasing out fossil fuels urgently. Here's what he said.
*06:53.320- 07:00.060* :  There is no science out there or no scenario out there that says that the phase out of fossil fuel
*07:00.060- 07:05.860* :  is what's going to achieve 1.5. That may suggest he was denying key aspects of climate science,
*07:05.860- 07:11.280* :  but he immediately followed that by saying that he believes phasing out the use of fossil fuels
*07:11.280- 07:17.400* :  is both inevitable and essential. That is a strong acknowledgement not just of the science
*07:17.400- 07:25.160* :  but of the need to act on it. And it needs to be orderly, fair, just and responsible,
*07:25.160- 07:32.600* :  and it needs to be well managed. So allow me to say that I am quite surprised at the constant
*07:32.600- 07:39.540* :  attempt to undermine this message. The dispute seems to be over the question of urgency.
*07:39.580- 07:45.620* :  At a press conference today, the COP28 president was joined by Jim Ski, the head of the UN
*07:45.620- 07:53.020* :  science body. He said to keep the temperature rise to 1.5 celsius by 2050, coal needed to be
*07:53.020- 08:02.020* :  phased out completely. Oil use by 2050 is reduced by 60 percent. A natural gas use reduced by
*08:02.020- 08:10.560* :  45 percent. Mr Al Jabar repeated that COP28 would prove an inflection point in global action on
*08:10.560- 08:17.060* :  climate change. It is a hint of something sources close to the presidency have told me that Mr Al Jabar
*08:17.340- 08:23.100* :  believes he is close to getting this summit to agree to a significant strengthening of the language
*08:23.100- 08:30.900* :  on climate change, a commitment that we need to phase down, possibly even phase out the use of
*08:30.900- 08:38.780* :  fossil fuels. Bizarre as it might sound, that would be a world first. Justin Rola with that report.
*08:40.120- 08:44.200* :  Over the last three decades in the United States, hundreds of thousands of people have died from
*08:44.200- 08:50.160* :  overdosing on opiates. Many of them prescribed to them by their doctors as a painkiller.
*08:50.800- 08:57.220* :  Oxycontin made by Perdue Farmer, first hit the market in 1996. And today, the US Supreme Court
*08:57.220- 09:02.820* :  is hearing arguments on whether to uphold a $6 billion compensation deal for victims.
*09:02.860- 09:08.940* :  The drug was marketed aggressively. This is an extract from one of their TV ads from the late 1990s.
*09:09.300- 09:14.180* :  Less than 1 percent of patients taking opiates actually become addicted.
*09:14.960- 09:20.620* :  I got my life back now. Now I can enjoy every day that I leave. I can really enjoy myself.
*09:21.340- 09:24.880* :  Some of the victims' families were outside the Supreme Court protesting.
*09:24.940- 09:27.520* :  Jen Tredjo lost her son, Christopher.
*09:28.020- 09:32.580* :  My son was priceless and he was beautiful and you stole him from me with a little pill
*09:32.580- 09:37.040* :  that you knew would have killed him eventually. And then you have the nerve to blame him,
*09:37.040- 09:42.840* :  the addict. Tame Mr. Sackler, tell me, would you give your kids or your grandkids Oxycontin?
*09:43.200- 09:47.700* :  What do you? Well, the compensation agreement was originally approved earlier this year in a
*09:47.700- 09:52.040* :  New York court, but it's been challenged by the Biden administration because it would also
*09:52.040- 09:57.420* :  protect members of the Sackler family who own Purdue from future opioid-related lawsuits.
*09:57.420- 10:01.980* :  So what's the stake for everyone involved? A question for our correspondent in Washington,
*10:01.980- 10:07.500* :  Nomi Iqbal. I think the question at the heart of this, which has split a lot of families,
*10:07.500- 10:14.200* :  is should the desire to punish the Sacklers, the ex-owners, get in the way of giving money to
*10:14.200- 10:19.540* :  those people who need it? This is something that's been going on for decades. It is destroyed
*10:19.540- 10:24.800* :  families. I met many of them outside the Supreme Court today and they want compensation.
*10:25.080- 10:31.060* :  But then the argument is, do you go after the ex-owners? What do you do? Because this is holding up
*10:31.340- 10:36.020* :  a lot of that compensation. There's billions that's due to be poured into addiction treatment
*10:36.020- 10:42.080* :  and other relief efforts. And there are about 60,000 individuals affected by Purdue's pain killers
*10:42.080- 10:46.800* :  who want this deal to go ahead rather than endlessly going after the Sacklers. But then you've got
*10:46.800- 10:51.920* :  others, like the ones I spoke to outside court who say, actually, we want both. We want the money,
*10:51.920- 10:57.200* :  we want to be compensated, but we want this family to be held responsible. They say to me,
*10:57.200- 11:03.860* :  why do they get to walk away rich and not bankrupt? Is there any sign which way they will rule?
*11:04.440- 11:10.240* :  The oral arguments were, as you can expect, quite divisive. And I was outside court with some
*11:10.240- 11:15.240* :  of the family members listening to those arguments being made. And the families were cheering
*11:15.340- 11:20.360* :  at a lot of points during the arguments where you had some of the justices, particularly the
*11:20.360- 11:26.180* :  liberal justices, asking that question about why the Sacklers still have money. Remember,
*11:26.180- 11:31.320* :  this is technically a bankruptcy case. We don't know which way it will go, but it is one of those
*11:31.320- 11:37.780* :  cases. It has the ability to set precedents for future cases. I just want to quote one of the
*11:37.780- 11:43.480* :  family members that spoke to me outside court, a woman named Alexis. She has given up her career
*11:43.480- 11:48.760* :  as an engineer to pursue this because she lost her son, who was addicted to oxycontin.
*11:48.760- 11:54.440* :  She said to me, I can't even find the prescription from 20 years ago from the doctors that gave
*11:54.440- 11:58.820* :  her son these drugs, which he then got hooked on. So she doesn't even know how she can get compensation.
*11:58.820- 12:04.600* :  So this is going to be running on for some time, as I say, it has divided families as well,
*12:04.820- 12:07.860* :  but we do expect to get that decision at some point next year.
*12:08.540- 12:14.440* :  Nomiya Ikbal there. Does anyone want to host the Commonwealth Games in 2026?
*12:15.460- 12:19.520* :  Well, the Gold Coast in Australia's East instead of Queensland has become the latest
*12:19.520- 12:24.480* :  to pull out after failing to secure government funding to take on what is one of the largest
*12:24.480- 12:28.160* :  global sporting events. Phil Mercer and Sydney is following the story.
*12:28.560- 12:34.500* :  The Gold Coast in Queensland said that it was willing to host the Commonwealth Games in 2026
*12:34.620- 12:41.740* :  after the Southern Australian State of Victoria pulled out in July, citing financial constraints.
*12:41.740- 12:47.540* :  Victoria is saying that the event was costing too much money. So he said that the Gold Coast Mayor
*12:47.540- 12:54.220* :  Tom Tate, unilaterally, he said his city was willing to take on the event in three years time,
*12:54.220- 12:59.380* :  but he said that he's now pulling the pin because there is no support from the state.
*12:59.380- 13:03.420* :  Government in Queensland also, the federal government in Canberra,
*13:03.640- 13:10.460* :  and Mr Tate is saying that his decision to abandon plans to launch a bid really fails to save
*13:10.460- 13:15.280* :  Australia's sporting reputation. He believes that that reputation has been tarnished
*13:15.640- 13:21.420* :  by Victoria's decision to walk away from the Games. The Queensland State Government has said
*13:21.420- 13:26.000* :  previously that it's not interested in hosting the Commonwealth Games, referring instead
*13:26.000- 13:34.100* :  to concentrate on the bigger prize of hosting the Olympics in 2032. This is, of course, an event
*13:34.100- 13:39.660* :  that has had financial problems before. The UK City of Birmingham stepped in to host the Games
*13:39.660- 13:46.080* :  last year after the South African City of Durban said it couldn't afford to carry on. So there
*13:46.080- 13:51.820* :  will be many athletes, fans and administrators very disappointed in the Gold Coast's decision
*13:52.240- 13:56.640* :  and still the Commonwealth Games is looking for a home in 2026.
*13:57.400- 14:02.040* :  Phil Mercer and Sidney, or Victoria, had stepped up after applications from
*14:02.040- 14:08.260* :  Kuala Lumpur, Cardiff, Calgary, Edmonton and Adelaide were all withdrawn. To make things worse,
*14:08.260- 14:13.660* :  there is nowhere in sight for the 2030 Games to go. After the only bidder, the Canadian province
*14:13.660- 14:18.940* :  of Alberta withdrew. Subreddon Foster is a former British athlete and Commonwealth Games champion
*14:18.940- 14:24.860* :  and was part of the Birmingham 2022 bid team. Since the days of the early Commonwealth Games,
*14:24.860- 14:29.940* :  sports now organised on a regional basis, you know, African Championships, Asian
*14:29.940- 14:34.940* :  Championships, European Championships, American Championships, etc. And for the big sports,
*14:34.940- 14:39.760* :  the Commonwealth Games has passed its sell-by date. You don't need it because often the athletes
*14:39.760- 14:45.040* :  have to cram in an event here because of the World Championships. I think it's passed its sell-by
*14:45.080- 14:48.620* :  date and I said when Birmingham has happened, probably the last Commonwealth Games we ever see.
*14:49.420- 14:50.180* :  Subreddon Foster
*14:52.960- 14:56.880* :  Still to calm on the Glowon News podcast, just what is Riz?
*14:57.740- 15:02.820* :  So a person can have Riz but can also Riz someone up. If your ability to be able to pick up people,
*15:03.300- 15:07.960* :  so someone that's attractive might have good Riz but they also might be terrible at talking to
*15:07.960- 15:11.600* :  women and have no Riz. We hear about the latest Word of the Year.
*15:18.780- 15:23.960* :  Dozens of protesters staged a demonstration outside the UN headquarters in New York on Monday,
*15:24.500- 15:29.240* :  accusing the body of inaction over the rape, abduction and mistreatment of Israelis.
*15:30.100- 15:34.860* :  The police and other organisations in Israel have been gathering accounts of sexual violence
*15:34.860- 15:41.000* :  on October 7th perpetrated by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and possibly other Palestinian groups
*15:41.380- 15:44.500* :  and individuals who cross through the border fence that day.
*15:45.240- 15:50.720* :  Yal Shere is from the Survivors of Sexual Violent Advocacy Group which works with female
*15:50.720- 15:58.980* :  and male victims. What we learn is that there was sexual violence and rape in these communities
*15:58.980- 16:07.980* :  in the south of Israel, rural villages, these farms and also we do have reports of sexual violence
*16:07.980- 16:16.480* :  from the two music festivals during the holiday. We do have now eyewitnesses that the police
*16:16.480- 16:24.320* :  is interviewed already and first responders of course and we do now have a few survivors,
*16:24.980- 16:32.340* :  not a lot of both genders so it didn't only happen to women, it happened to men as well and
*16:32.340- 16:37.980* :  that's very important to say. The anger that organisations like UN Women took so long to speak
*16:37.980- 16:43.500* :  out about alleged atrocities committed by Hamas and other Palestinians against Israelis,
*16:44.300- 16:48.360* :  Professor Ruth Halperen Kadari is an Israeli lawyer and women's rights advocate,
*16:48.360- 16:53.060* :  who's went 12 years as a member of a UN convention on discrimination against women.
*16:53.680- 16:57.620* :  She's been speaking to Michelle Hussain, you might find some of what she says disturbing.
*16:57.980- 17:07.580* :  I saw a number of first-hand eyewitness accounts for example of one survivor who hid in the bushes
*17:07.580- 17:14.900* :  and saw a woman next to her being raped by several men and I will not go into detailing the
*17:15.180- 17:22.120* :  extreme brutality of mutilation that she also witnessed. I talked to a first responder
*17:22.120- 17:30.220* :  paramedic who treated a woman who was brought to his ambulance and she was heavily bleeding again.
*17:30.220- 17:38.780* :  I will not describe in what way and exactly her condition but she lost blood to the degree of
*17:38.780- 17:46.220* :  life risk situation and she told him that she had been raped by four men. I saw footage and pictures
*17:46.480- 17:54.420* :  from numerous locations of bodies whose condition were all exhibiting the same pattern
*17:54.420- 18:03.860* :  of mutilation and leaving no doubt that rape was performed on these women before they were
*18:03.860- 18:12.040* :  executed and this matches the condition of the bodies as described by women who worked at the
*18:12.040- 18:20.080* :  Shura Base which turned into a morgue. I saw testimonies of numerous first responders describing
*18:20.080- 18:28.260* :  what they found as they collected the bodies and this leaves no doubt that such a concentration
*18:28.360- 18:36.620* :  of cases in a less than a day in numerous locations it could not have been had there not been
*18:36.620- 18:43.620* :  a planned pre-meditation to use sexual violence as a weapon of war. As you started to become
*18:43.620- 18:49.500* :  aware of all of this in the aftermath of October the 7th and knowing the UN system as you do
*18:49.500- 18:56.060* :  who did you talk to or turn to? A day after October 7 together with colleagues with Professor
*18:56.060- 19:03.800* :  Francis Reddye of the Hebrew University we wrote letters to the C. Dock committee to the CRC
*19:03.800- 19:10.380* :  committee to the special repertoire and violence against women to UN women of course and to numerous
*19:10.380- 19:19.400* :  other UN entities and we asked them to recognize that this has taken place and to condemn it to
*19:19.400- 19:25.940* :  acknowledge that this was crimes against humanity in the nature of sexual violence against women
*19:26.280- 19:34.360* :  regrettably until a week ago none of them actually said the explicit words sexual violence that
*19:34.360- 19:43.560* :  was performed by Hamas towards Israel. It took them more than seven weeks first the secretary general
*19:43.560- 19:51.620* :  Antonio Guterres and then just this Saturday UN women finally issued a statement that did recognize
*19:51.740- 19:58.940* :  sexual violence as part of the Hamas attack and said the explicit words Hamas and called for
*19:58.940- 20:06.000* :  a vigorous investigation but this took them much much too long. Professor Ruth Halperin Kadari
*20:06.000- 20:11.680* :  speaking to Michelle Hussain Guyana has accused its South American neighbour Venezuela of trying to
*20:11.680- 20:18.140* :  start a conflict after a referendum in Venezuela overwhelmingly approved establishing a new state
*20:18.140- 20:24.260* :  on Guyanese territory which has vast oil deposits in a meeting with supporters in Caracas
*20:24.260- 20:34.220* :  President Nicolas Maduro welcomed the result of the referendum. Long live the victory of the Venezuelan
*20:34.220- 20:41.060* :  people long live the consultative referendum we have taken the first steps of a new historical
*20:41.060- 20:49.640* :  stage to fight for what is ours to recover Guyana Essequiba. Guyana's president Mohamed
*20:49.640- 20:55.100* :  Irfan Ali speaking to the BBC on Sunday said the referendum was a serious cause for concern for
*20:55.100- 21:00.540* :  his nation. The rhetoric out of Venezuela and the even attitude of the president and vice
*21:00.540- 21:06.740* :  president necessities serious concerns and we cannot be caught wanting as the president of Ghana
*21:06.740- 21:10.460* :  we have to take everything the president of the military say very seriously.
*21:11.240- 21:15.960* :  Guyana says it remains vigilant following the outcome of Sunday's referendum in Venezuela.
*21:15.960- 21:21.520* :  Dr Christopher Sabatini is a senior fellow for Latin America at Chattam House in London
*21:21.520- 21:26.900* :  and Professor at the London School of Economics. Paul Henley asked him more about the significance
*21:26.900- 21:32.280* :  of the landing question. It's very important. It represents about two-thirds of Guyana and it's
*21:32.280- 21:38.620* :  rich in minerals and it's rich in oil. In 2015 they discovered oils off the coast of the Essequiba
*21:38.620- 21:44.180* :  region. You're looking at 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil. So this is a huge boon to
*21:44.180- 21:48.980* :  whoever owns it but Venezuela's headlink claims to this section of Guyana since basically
*21:48.980- 21:54.200* :  the late 19th century. It was resolved when it was still a colony of Britain at the time.
*21:54.200- 21:58.260* :  It was resolved that this was the border as it currently is but Venezuela has always claimed
*21:58.260- 22:04.760* :  that part of Guyana as its own. How seriously is the result of this poll being taken?
*22:04.760- 22:10.460* :  It's clearly a threat of a land grab and annexation. It's done largely for domestic reasons.
*22:10.460- 22:15.280* :  What Madodo is doing. His popularity is tanking. He's supposed to have elections next year which
*22:15.780- 22:19.940* :  according to polls he would lose quite handily. Who's wrapping himself in the flag and a
*22:20.160- 22:23.940* :  very contentious issue always for Venezuela. If you go to Venezuela in schools for example,
*22:23.940- 22:28.340* :  Venezuela and embassies includes that Essequiba region in their own official maps.
*22:28.780- 22:34.440* :  But clearly this is an effort to reactivate his popularity, mobilize people as well as marginalize
*22:34.440- 22:38.620* :  the opposition. But there is a risk here because while it is for domestic consumption he's clearly
*22:38.620- 22:44.000* :  up the stakes and right now of course with 95% of the people and it was low turnout approving
*22:44.000- 22:48.860* :  the idea of creating Essequiba as another state of Venezuela. We're looking at potential conflict
*22:48.880- 22:53.000* :  because he's headed down that road and anything can happen now. It's got neighboring countries on
*22:53.000- 22:59.220* :  alert already. Brazil mobilizing the army on the border. Exactly right. The delegation from
*22:59.220- 23:03.240* :  Brazil's foreign ministry had traveled to Venezuela to try to discourage them from any sort of
*23:03.620- 23:07.520* :  potentially alarmist rhetoric or alarmist actions. But they came back and they mobilized the
*23:07.520- 23:11.500* :  military. Also, Venezuela's building an air strip on the other side of the Guyanese border,
*23:11.500- 23:14.300* :  which is causing some people some concern about what could happen.
*23:14.840- 23:20.440* :  You mentioned that President Maduro was at risk of losing elections next year and that he needs
*23:20.440- 23:25.740* :  to gain popularity. There is a fear, isn't there, that these elections could not be free and
*23:25.740- 23:31.400* :  democratic? Oh, very much. The 2018 elections were derided internationally as being completely
*23:31.400- 23:36.680* :  unfair out and out stolen. The US has lifted sanctions unilaterally in a hope of trying to encourage
*23:36.680- 23:40.760* :  the Venezuelan government to engage in a series of steps, including inviting international
*23:40.760- 23:45.280* :  elections monitors to try to ensure the elections are if not free and fairly competitive and
*23:45.280- 23:49.240* :  inclusive. But of course, there's a strong disincentive for the government of Maduro to do so,
*23:49.240- 23:53.680* :  because it will clearly lose. At the same time, there are more than 200 individual personal
*23:53.680- 23:57.560* :  sanctions on officials within the government for everything from narcotics trafficking to human
*23:57.560- 24:01.260* :  rights abuses. So if they risk, if they're voted out of office, they risk going to jail.
*24:01.800- 24:07.420* :  That was Dr. Christopher Sabatini. Sweden has long held a reputation as one of the safest
*24:07.420- 24:12.520* :  and most peaceful places in Europe. But deadly shootings are becoming a growing problem.
*24:12.720- 24:17.220* :  Just over 50 people have already been killed in gun violence this year in a country with a
*24:17.220- 24:22.820* :  population of just 10 million people. And there'd be more than 140 explosions as gang members
*24:22.820- 24:28.460* :  increasingly target the homes and businesses of rivals and their families. Madi Savage reports from Stockholm.
*24:33.200- 24:37.740* :  I'm on a commuter train heading to an area called Uplands Brawl in the north of the capital.
*24:38.620- 24:43.220* :  There's a big nature reserve and at Brawl Station, you're greeted with orange arrows pointing
*24:43.220- 24:49.020* :  to hiking trails. But a 14-year-old boy was recently found dead in woods here. And there've
*24:49.020- 24:54.840* :  been bombings targeting billers and apartment blocks. My name is Anna. I have three children. We live
*24:54.840- 25:01.520* :  here in Brawl. And how are you feeling about this trend for brutal violence? It's awful.
*25:01.920- 25:06.440* :  You hear reports about violence happening every day. You wake up in the morning and you read
*25:06.440- 25:12.420* :  the newspapers and it's been multiple explosions most days. We've woken up by explosions in the
*25:12.420- 25:18.420* :  neighborhood and it's scary. A few years ago, gang violence usually took place in low-income suburbs
*25:18.420- 25:24.060* :  here in Stockholm and other big cities, but it spread to multiple neighborhoods and smaller towns.
*25:24.060- 25:30.220* :  Partly because gangs are increasingly targeting rivals' relatives. Some of the violence is now
*25:30.220- 25:36.040* :  organized by criminal networks based abroad and it's carried out by boys in their early teens,
*25:36.040- 25:42.040* :  often recruited through social media, with promises of money and designer clothes. Sweden is one
*25:42.040- 25:46.980* :  of the hot spots for gun violence in Europe at the moment. Nils Duket is a firearms researcher
*25:46.980- 25:52.560* :  based at the Flemish Peace Institute in Brussels. What we're seeing now is that various types of
*25:52.560- 25:57.660* :  homemade explosives are being used. Sweden of course has mining industry which also involves a lot
*25:57.660- 26:02.740* :  of explosive materials where these can actually be acquired from and used to make bombs themselves.
*26:04.260- 26:10.120* :  Here at Sweden's round waterfront parliament in central Stockholm, a right-wing coalition came
*26:10.120- 26:16.000* :  into power just over a year ago and blamed the rising violence on immigration. Government-funded
*26:16.000- 26:22.160* :  research shows young people born in Sweden to parents from abroad are overrepresented as both
*26:22.160- 26:28.480* :  suspects and victims. We can now see that our outside ship and lack of integration in combination
*26:28.480- 26:35.340* :  with trade of narcotics and organized crime is creating this very toxic mixture. That is Sweden's
*26:35.340- 26:40.800* :  foreign minister to be a spielstrom speaking to the BBC in September. The new government's been
*26:40.800- 26:45.960* :  trying to stop the violence with a string of new laws. It recently made it an offence to recruit
*26:45.960- 26:51.380* :  children to carry out crimes and ministers want to double prison sentences for offences including
*26:51.380- 26:58.360* :  gun crimes and detonating explosives. My government aims to both see to it that we can crush organized
*26:58.360- 27:03.960* :  crime and also that we deal with the failed integration and the consequences both in labor market
*27:03.960- 27:08.520* :  and education systems. They plan to make it harder for immigrants from outside the European
*27:08.520- 27:14.080* :  Union to get social benefits to try and get more people working and to invest in more projects
*27:14.080- 27:22.300* :  designed to improve Swedish language skills. I'm in Yeva now, a multicultural Stockholm neighbourhood
*27:22.300- 27:26.940* :  that's experienced a lot of violence over the past few years, although there haven't been any
*27:26.940- 27:33.380* :  deadly shootings in 2023. Here there's been a mixed reaction to the government's tough approach.
*27:33.420- 27:40.160* :  Liban Varsam's son was killed in a shooting in 2020. Police say he wasn't in a gang and wasn't
*27:40.160- 27:46.460* :  a target. Liban wants much more investment in crime prevention, including extra support for
*27:46.460- 27:51.480* :  people convicted of low-level crimes like shoplifting who can struggle to get work afterwards.
*27:51.900- 27:58.780* :  It's hard for them to sit at home for hours without an income. So they go outside and
*27:58.780- 28:05.720* :  stand around and then there's a big risk that they'll be recruited really easily. Many of the
*28:05.720- 28:11.760* :  children in this neighbourhood have parents who escaped war. Some locals say better mental health
*28:11.760- 28:17.200* :  services are an important part of the solution, including this teenager who grew up around drugs.
*28:17.200- 28:23.800* :  I was 11 when I started to get into trouble. 11? Yeah kids here they are really mean to each other.
*28:24.080- 28:27.120* :  They want someone to hear and to speak about their emotions but they don't know how to speak
*28:27.120- 28:33.140* :  about their emotions. So what they do instead is that they lash out. Sweden's problem with gang
*28:33.140- 28:38.560* :  violence is clearly a complex one and aside from the pain it's causing affected communities,
*28:39.280- 28:43.780* :  there are also worries about how it's affecting the country's global image, how that could impact
*28:43.780- 28:49.260* :  the economy and whether the gang wars here will spread to other parts of Scandinavia.
*28:50.340- 28:55.240* :  And you can hear more about Sweden's struggle with guns in Maddie's documentary Sweden
*28:55.240- 28:59.740* :  Living with guns and gangs on the BBC World Service and BBC Sounds.
*29:01.100- 29:07.560* :  It's known as AE23A moving at about five kilometres an hour and it's loose in the Antarctic ocean.
*29:07.820- 29:13.480* :  Now the UK's Polar Ship, RRS, Sir David Attenborough has come face to face with it. The world's
*29:13.480- 29:19.040* :  biggest iceberg. So how big is it and what's its potential impact? I spoke to our science correspondent
*29:19.040- 29:25.420* :  Jonathan Amos. They define normal thinking. I mean they are huge what we call tabular icebergs. Now
*29:25.420- 29:31.560* :  these kind of flat tops. So this one almost 4,000 square kilometres. But at the same time
*29:31.560- 29:39.440* :  300 metres thickness of ice is thick but set against that 4,000 square kilometres is kind of thin.
*29:39.860- 29:43.820* :  It's moving gradually northward to understand and then it's going to move clockwise.
*29:44.540- 29:49.840* :  How important is it for the ecosystems around there? Is there going to be an impact on human
*29:49.840- 29:55.780* :  activity as well? Well this iceberg is so big it's hard to miss if you're in a ship but that
*29:55.780- 30:00.340* :  doesn't mean there won't be bits breaking off. The thing about these bugs is the enormous
*30:00.340- 30:07.240* :  influence that they have on the environment, on ecosystems. So they carry nutrients into the
*30:07.240- 30:11.860* :  southern ocean and beyond. They're like great fertiliser machines. They have scraped
*30:12.260- 30:16.660* :  rock dust off the Antarctic continent. You know when they were part of a glacier over thousands
*30:16.660- 30:22.260* :  of years. They've trapped nutrients and then they dumped this stuff in the ocean as they melt
*30:22.260- 30:29.840* :  hundreds of millions of tons of fresh water into the ocean every single day and then that load
*30:29.840- 30:35.220* :  of nutrients is what sparks productivity right at the bottom of the food chain. So all of the
*30:35.220- 30:41.100* :  phytoplankton the little crow like creatures that penguins and whales like to feed on they will
*30:41.100- 30:47.460* :  feed on the phytoplankton. In areas of the ocean which otherwise might not have that productivity
*30:47.460- 30:52.380* :  if these monster icebergs were not passing by. It sounds potentially sort of great for the
*30:52.380- 30:57.800* :  environment locally but is this on the move now because of climate change? That's an interesting
*30:57.800- 31:02.960* :  question. I was speaking to a scientist today who said we've had quite a few big weapons recently
*31:02.980- 31:09.380* :  now. Is that part of some great cycle or is there some signal buried in there? You could only
*31:09.380- 31:15.160* :  really get it that with long-term data. We've got a satellite record in the Antarctic which goes
*31:15.160- 31:22.220* :  back to the 70s or the late 60s. So I'm not sure that the record is long enough to really say much
*31:22.220- 31:26.960* :  about that. Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos and you can read his online article and see
*31:26.960- 31:33.080* :  pictures on the BBC News website. Now as we approach the end of the year global dictionaries face
*31:33.080- 31:39.360* :  the difficult task of choosing a word that best sums up 2023. Merrim Webster picked authentic
*31:39.360- 31:45.500* :  and Cambridge went with hallucinate. Now the Oxford University Press has announced its word of the
*31:45.500- 31:51.520* :  year and it's this. Do you have a Riz ultimate Riz game in the gym? Okay your best Riz line. You don't
*31:51.520- 32:00.560* :  got Riz? Unbeatable Riz. Yes it's Riz which is slang for romantic appeal or charm. It's
*32:00.560- 32:06.200* :  mainly used by young people like my son for example who's 17 and in the thousands on TikTok so
*32:06.200- 32:12.000* :  maybe less familiar to those of us who are a bit older. For a guide Sarah Montague spoke to
*32:12.000- 32:17.120* :  journalists and writer Flora Gill who unpicked the meaning and usage of the word Riz. I think
*32:17.120- 32:21.340* :  you can think of it as Riz is being short for charisma so that's the charisma someone has the
*32:21.340- 32:26.100* :  ability to chat up a person and to charm a love interest. I think the equivalent for the older
*32:26.100- 32:30.380* :  generation or the for millennials would be game. Game is what people used to say they've got such
*32:30.380- 32:35.700* :  great game they've got game. It can be a noun or a verb so a person can have Riz but can also Riz
*32:35.700- 32:41.700* :  someone up. It's your ability to be able to pick up people so someone that's attractive might have
*32:41.700- 32:45.860* :  good Riz but they also might be terrible at talking to women and have no Riz. You can also have
*32:45.860- 32:51.340* :  negative Riz. You're so bad at chatting up people you've got less than no Riz. You can also have
*32:51.340- 32:56.680* :  unspoken Riz which is your ability to just attract people with the way you look and act without
*32:56.680- 33:03.520* :  even saying a word. So can you give us some examples of people who do have Riz. An older example
*33:03.520- 33:08.040* :  for millennials and above would you might say Barney Stinson and how I met your mother was an
*33:08.040- 33:13.520* :  example of that character being all about Riz. Okay but so is it a worthy winner of the word of the
*33:13.520- 33:17.960* :  year? Yeah I think it's a worthy winner it's definitely a new word that's propped up it's definitely
*33:17.960- 33:24.520* :  used all over TikTok all over social media. It's very of the moment but how long it will last
*33:24.520- 33:29.360* :  because it's such new slang is to be seen. Flora Gill speaking to Sarah Montague
*33:32.160- 33:35.420* :  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*33:35.420- 33:39.960* :  later on. This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and the producer was Emma Joseph.
