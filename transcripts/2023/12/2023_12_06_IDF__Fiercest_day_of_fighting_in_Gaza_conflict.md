*00:00.000- 00:03.920* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.460- 00:09.100* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson, and in the early hours of Wednesday,
*00:09.100- 00:12.120* :  the 6th of December, these are our main stories.
*00:12.840- 00:14.700* :  The bombings didn't stop.
*00:15.020- 00:17.860* :  We're now heading to Rafa, to the unknown.
*00:18.080- 00:20.840* :  And I didn't know if I'd make it any more.
*00:21.400- 00:24.220* :  People in Gaza flee the southern city of Han Unis,
*00:24.520- 00:26.800* :  which has been surrounded by Israeli forces
*00:27.220- 00:28.740* :  on the heaviest day of fighting
*00:28.740- 00:30.540* :  since their invasion of the territory.
*00:31.200- 00:33.380* :  Washington says it'll refuse visas
*00:33.380- 00:35.460* :  for extremist Israeli settlers
*00:35.900- 00:37.180* :  who've attacked Palestinians.
*00:37.260- 00:40.420* :  Also, my boys, they're school friends, they're parents.
*00:40.560- 00:44.120* :  When you say we are separated because I don't earn that.
*00:44.240- 00:46.460* :  They look at you as though it's incredulous.
*00:46.460- 00:47.740* :  They're like, what do you mean?
*00:48.000- 00:48.600* :  But you're married?
*00:48.860- 00:50.240* :  Yes, and he's their father.
*00:50.600- 00:50.840* :  Yeah.
*00:51.480- 00:54.880* :  The families torn apart by the UK's latest plans
*00:54.880- 00:56.900* :  to cut back on immigration.
*00:59.740- 01:02.640* :  Also in this podcast, we hear about the mass exodus
*01:02.660- 01:05.580* :  of Sri Lanka's medical staff to other countries.
*01:05.960- 01:06.460* :  And...
*01:06.720- 01:10.420* :  A football fan told us that, well, this is taking all the fan
*01:10.420- 01:13.000* :  out of the sports because it seems that the referee
*01:13.000- 01:15.100* :  was actually helping Arkadak to win.
*01:15.540- 01:19.080* :  The Turkmenistan football team that just can't stop winning.
*01:23.120- 01:25.860* :  And Israeli commander says his forces have been engaged
*01:25.860- 01:27.860* :  in their most intense day of fighting
*01:27.860- 01:31.000* :  since launching their offensive in the Gaza Strip.
*01:31.500- 01:33.280* :  After days of fierce bombardment,
*01:33.520- 01:36.140* :  Major General Yaron Finkelman said his troops
*01:36.140- 01:38.340* :  were in the heart of the city of Khan Yunus
*01:38.560- 01:39.840* :  in the south of the territory.
*01:40.340- 01:42.100* :  civilians there have been urged to flee
*01:42.100- 01:45.980* :  as Israel targets what it says are Hamas strongholds.
*01:46.520- 01:48.560* :  DiMaganim, a 22-year-old student,
*01:48.560- 01:51.200* :  sent this WhatsApp message to the BBC.
*01:51.860- 01:54.900* :  After moving to Khan Yunus from Gaza City,
*01:54.900- 01:56.980* :  we thought it would be safe here.
*01:57.400- 01:58.300* :  We were so wrong.
*01:58.920- 02:00.460* :  Last night was insane.
*02:01.080- 02:05.040* :  The bombings didn't stop even for a single minute.
*02:05.640- 02:08.360* :  The situation here is even more chaotic.
*02:08.760- 02:10.920* :  We don't know how to save our lives anymore
*02:10.980- 02:12.460* :  or a way to go.
*02:12.940- 02:15.320* :  People are just furious and scared.
*02:16.000- 02:19.120* :  And we're all trapped when bombings are non-stop.
*02:19.300- 02:20.780* :  People who are leaving to the,
*02:21.000- 02:23.280* :  they're leaving to build tents in the streets
*02:23.280- 02:24.500* :  in this cold weather.
*02:24.920- 02:28.080* :  And there's no enough food or resources in Rafa
*02:28.080- 02:30.240* :  for an extra one million people.
*02:30.840- 02:33.660* :  We're now heading to Rafa to the unknown.
*02:33.660- 02:36.540* :  And I don't know if I'll make it anymore.
*02:37.280- 02:39.100* :  In the north of Gaza, Israeli troops
*02:39.100- 02:41.420* :  have surrounded the Jabbalia refugee camp,
*02:41.420- 02:44.420* :  which they say is a base for Hamas militants.
*02:44.920- 02:45.820* :  Speaking to the BBC,
*02:45.820- 02:48.000* :  a spokesperson for the campaign group,
*02:48.000- 02:50.220* :  Human Rights Watch, Sari Bashi,
*02:50.400- 02:54.080* :  said Israel had put gazons in an impossible situation.
*02:54.680- 02:56.080* :  When you warn people to leave,
*02:56.360- 02:58.280* :  and there's no safe place to go to,
*02:58.520- 02:59.960* :  and no safe way to get there,
*03:00.360- 03:01.740* :  that's not an effective warning.
*03:01.980- 03:03.260* :  And under all circumstances,
*03:03.320- 03:04.980* :  civilians who remain behind,
*03:04.980- 03:07.480* :  either because they cannot or will not leave,
*03:07.760- 03:09.380* :  retain their civilian protection.
*03:09.740- 03:12.700* :  Giving people a QR code on social media,
*03:12.700- 03:14.640* :  when you've cut telecommunications,
*03:14.780- 03:16.200* :  there's no electricity,
*03:16.760- 03:18.700* :  and the maps themselves are confusing.
*03:18.700- 03:21.220* :  And error written is a cool joke.
*03:21.980- 03:23.860* :  Speaking from Ramallah in the West Bank,
*03:23.860- 03:27.260* :  Mustafa Baguti from the Palestinian National Initiative,
*03:27.660- 03:29.160* :  a Palestinian political party,
*03:29.160- 03:32.560* :  gave his assessment of the situation in Gaza.
*03:33.040- 03:35.780* :  Unfortunately, I have to tell you that what we see here
*03:35.780- 03:39.080* :  is that Israel is violating so many international laws,
*03:39.760- 03:42.320* :  conducting three war crimes at the same time.
*03:42.980- 03:44.540* :  The war crime of genocide,
*03:44.540- 03:46.480* :  the war crime of collective punishment,
*03:46.480- 03:48.340* :  and the war crime of ethnic cleansing.
*03:49.020- 03:51.340* :  The former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Al-Murt,
*03:51.340- 03:53.880* :  says the Israeli government needs to make it clear
*03:54.240- 03:55.960* :  what it thinks should happen next,
*03:56.420- 03:58.020* :  otherwise they won't be given the time
*03:58.020- 03:59.960* :  to complete the military operation.
*04:00.520- 04:02.540* :  We'll be hearing from an Israeli MP shortly,
*04:02.540- 04:05.800* :  but first, this report from our diplomatic correspondent,
*04:05.800- 04:07.580* :  Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem.
*04:08.080- 04:08.760* :  Ah!
*04:10.560- 04:13.460* :  As Israeli forces turn their attention to the south,
*04:13.460- 04:16.200* :  another city finds itself in the eye of the storm.
*04:16.680- 04:19.360* :  This was NASA hospital in Hanyunus this morning.
*04:21.500- 04:23.220* :  Four days after the ceasefire ended,
*04:23.220- 04:26.000* :  Israeli forces are gradually encircling the city.
*04:26.420- 04:29.060* :  At the hospital, there's a desperate, constant procession
*04:29.060- 04:31.100* :  of death, injury, and grief.
*04:33.180- 04:36.820* :  Lifting one small shrouded body from the back of a pickup truck,
*04:37.060- 04:39.400* :  Kasim Shiba faces the camera and demands,
*04:39.420- 04:41.940* :  why did this child deserve to die?
*04:41.940- 04:43.100* :  What did he do?
*04:45.320- 04:47.820* :  Seven members of Kasim's family were killed as they slept.
*04:48.920- 04:52.240* :  Death and displacement, two things Israel's American allies
*04:52.240- 04:53.480* :  have asked it to minimize,
*04:53.500- 04:57.420* :  but people are fleeing again, following Israel's instructions,
*04:57.920- 05:01.240* :  never quite knowing if they're heading for safety or more danger.
*05:03.420- 05:06.140* :  Further north in Darabala, a miraculous escape,
*05:06.640- 05:09.860* :  two sisters Maria and Lana pulled a lie from the rubble
*05:10.140- 05:11.560* :  three days after being buried,
*05:11.940- 05:14.040* :  along with dozens of members of their family.
*05:16.360- 05:18.480* :  I saw a body on the ground.
*05:19.540- 05:22.800* :  At first, I thought it was my sister Katia,
*05:23.480- 05:27.780* :  but then I looked again, and I thought it's Jenna, my cousin.
*05:29.560- 05:32.220* :  Israel knows that this stage of its war against Hamas
*05:32.480- 05:35.200* :  conducted in areas ever more crowded and desperate,
*05:35.700- 05:37.360* :  will be extremely challenging.
*05:37.820- 05:39.700* :  Peter Lerner is a spokesman for the military.
*05:40.120- 05:42.820* :  Yes, there is a dire situation in the South
*05:42.900- 05:46.320* :  where people are in stress and we acknowledge that.
*05:46.320- 05:50.680* :  We are constantly weighing up the military necessity of target
*05:51.020- 05:53.720* :  against the humanitarian and civilian strife
*05:53.720- 05:54.880* :  and concerns it will cause.
*05:55.260- 05:57.140* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*05:57.140- 05:59.460* :  has been meeting newly released hostages
*05:59.840- 06:02.220* :  and the families of those still being held in Gaza.
*06:02.760- 06:04.040* :  It was an angry encounter
*06:04.500- 06:06.080* :  with many wondering why the government
*06:06.080- 06:08.000* :  couldn't bring more hostages home.
*06:08.560- 06:12.260* :  Mr Netanyahu replied that this had been simply impossible.
*06:13.300- 06:14.680* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem.
*06:15.420- 06:17.780* :  Yulee Edelstein is a member of the Knesset
*06:17.780- 06:20.880* :  for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Lecude Party.
*06:20.880- 06:22.840* :  He's also a former health minister
*06:23.200- 06:25.460* :  and currently chairs the Knesset foreign affairs
*06:25.460- 06:26.380* :  and defence committee.
*06:26.960- 06:30.760* :  He told Rebecca Kesby that Israel is doing as much as possible
*06:30.760- 06:33.320* :  to protect Gaza's civilian population.
*06:33.820- 06:36.620* :  So our best interest, both for moral reasons,
*06:36.620- 06:39.020* :  we are not after civilian population in Gaza,
*06:39.020- 06:42.120* :  we are after Hamas there, but also for practical reasons
*06:42.120- 06:45.020* :  because Hamas understands very well
*06:45.120- 06:47.380* :  that the only way out of the situation
*06:47.380- 06:49.700* :  is to cause civilian casualties.
*06:49.900- 06:51.880* :  And that's exactly what Hamas is trying to do.
*06:51.880- 06:54.180* :  We are trying to avoid it in every possible way.
*06:54.340- 06:57.640* :  Yes, unfortunately, I will tend to agree
*06:57.640- 06:59.480* :  that there is a lot of chaos in Gaza
*06:59.700- 07:01.200* :  and we are doing practical things.
*07:01.420- 07:03.820* :  He's using all the possible means of communication
*07:03.880- 07:06.420* :  to inform the population where it is safe.
*07:06.860- 07:08.700* :  It's not easy, it's a war
*07:08.700- 07:10.760* :  and we have to understand that Hamas started
*07:10.760- 07:12.220* :  as with terrible atrocities.
*07:12.800- 07:14.720* :  We'll try to avoid casualties
*07:14.720- 07:17.040* :  amongst civilian population as much as we can.
*07:17.240- 07:20.640* :  But Israel is getting a lot of international criticism
*07:20.940- 07:23.740* :  over those numbers of civilian dead.
*07:23.740- 07:26.760* :  I mean, are you not worried that this assault
*07:26.760- 07:30.600* :  on the people of Gaza will actually prompt
*07:30.600- 07:33.500* :  more people to be radicalized against Israel?
*07:33.500- 07:34.740* :  I mean, isn't that a danger?
*07:35.080- 07:36.380* :  This is Israel, as I've said,
*07:36.380- 07:39.080* :  both moral obligation and best interest
*07:39.080- 07:42.120* :  to avoid civil casualties for the reasons that you mentioned.
*07:42.380- 07:43.980* :  We don't want international pressure.
*07:43.980- 07:46.520* :  We don't want to be perceived as a country
*07:46.520- 07:48.560* :  that is taking revenge on someone.
*07:49.000- 07:50.740* :  We are not in the revenge business.
*07:50.880- 07:54.040* :  We are trying to make sure that the residents
*07:54.040- 07:58.220* :  of peaceful Jewish communities in the south of the country
*07:58.700- 08:02.740* :  that went through terrible massacre on October 7th.
*08:02.920- 08:05.820* :  May I put one theory to you
*08:05.860- 08:08.000* :  that is actually getting a lot of traction
*08:08.000- 08:09.980* :  among Palestinian communities?
*08:09.980- 08:14.280* :  And that is that some Palestinians have the suspicion
*08:14.280- 08:18.340* :  that Israel is trying to push people out of Gaza.
*08:18.620- 08:19.340* :  Is that what you want?
*08:19.680- 08:20.640* :  The answer is no.
*08:20.660- 08:24.860* :  And to my Palestinian neighbors, I would give one advice.
*08:24.860- 08:28.300* :  We have to recognize an interesting fact.
*08:28.940- 08:32.100* :  We are not going anywhere and they are not going anywhere.
*08:32.480- 08:34.560* :  We'll have to learn, live side by side.
*08:34.700- 08:37.420* :  It's difficult to say this after what we witnessed
*08:37.420- 08:39.560* :  on October 7th.
*08:39.560- 08:41.360* :  The moment the Palestinians will realize
*08:41.360- 08:44.600* :  that they won't be able to see the destruction
*08:44.700- 08:48.140* :  of the Jewish state and the expulsion of Jews from this area.
*08:48.340- 08:50.500* :  I think that there will be a possibility
*08:50.500- 08:51.820* :  to really have a dialogue
*08:51.820- 08:53.540* :  and talk about future solutions.
*08:53.820- 08:56.500* :  I still probably not around the corner,
*08:56.660- 08:59.300* :  but as I've said, I think that eventually they'll have
*08:59.300- 09:02.380* :  to recognize the fact that Israelis and Palestinians
*09:02.380- 09:03.400* :  are here to stay.
*09:04.220- 09:07.000* :  Yulia Edelstein speaking to Rebecca Kesby.
*09:07.780- 09:09.020* :  In our previous podcast,
*09:09.020- 09:10.980* :  we reported on Britain and Rwanda
*09:10.980- 09:13.540* :  agreeing a new treaty aimed at getting
*09:13.540- 09:16.060* :  the British government's flagship asylum policy
*09:16.060- 09:19.160* :  operational, following a series of legal challenges.
*09:19.840- 09:22.840* :  The controversial plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda
*09:22.840- 09:26.740* :  was deemed illegal last month by the UK's Supreme Court,
*09:26.740- 09:29.700* :  because people could be returned to their home countries
*09:30.040- 09:31.000* :  among other issues.
*09:31.720- 09:34.200* :  Under this new treaty, that won't happen anymore,
*09:34.520- 09:36.800* :  but some legal experts are still unhappy.
*09:37.100- 09:40.060* :  Here's one of Britain's top lawyers, Jeffrey Robertson.
*09:40.440- 09:42.760* :  There were about a dozen reasons
*09:43.500- 09:47.060* :  why Rwanda was an unsafe country.
*09:47.540- 09:50.800* :  And it's going to deal by this treaty
*09:50.800- 09:51.840* :  with only one of them.
*09:52.900- 09:55.700* :  I asked our UK political correspondent, Robertson,
*09:56.080- 09:57.620* :  if the government will now be able
*09:57.620- 10:01.020* :  to send asylum seekers from Britain to Rwanda.
*10:01.340- 10:03.420* :  It's absolutely not a slam dunk,
*10:03.420- 10:07.540* :  any asylum seeker who is earmarked for being sent to Rwanda.
*10:07.540- 10:09.580* :  We'll no doubt do their best to appear
*10:09.580- 10:12.780* :  and sort of contest this idea that the British government
*10:12.780- 10:15.120* :  can't just declare somewhere safe
*10:15.420- 10:16.980* :  through a treaty or passing a law.
*10:17.660- 10:20.220* :  And will this law get through Parliament quickly
*10:20.220- 10:21.720* :  as the government is suggesting?
*10:22.240- 10:24.700* :  It depends on exactly how the law is framed.
*10:24.780- 10:26.540* :  I mean, if the law is too hard-line,
*10:26.540- 10:28.380* :  some people on the more liberal wing
*10:28.380- 10:31.500* :  of the government and conservative party won't like it.
*10:31.760- 10:33.320* :  If the law isn't hard-line enough,
*10:33.320- 10:34.980* :  well, Mr. Sunak, the Prime Minister
*10:34.980- 10:37.120* :  will have a problem with the right wing of this party,
*10:37.120- 10:39.220* :  so it could well be a bumpy ride.
*10:39.540- 10:41.000* :  And Rob, there are other changes
*10:41.000- 10:42.960* :  we made later this week involving
*10:42.960- 10:45.440* :  appealing asylum decisions, aren't there?
*10:46.080- 10:48.260* :  There are, but I mean, the main issue
*10:48.260- 10:50.420* :  is the attempt by the British government
*10:50.420- 10:52.260* :  in legislation that's to come,
*10:52.260- 10:54.240* :  that will essentially just try to make it
*10:54.240- 10:57.820* :  as hard as humanly possible for any decisions
*10:57.820- 10:59.600* :  to be challenged in the UK courts.
*10:59.600- 11:03.260* :  If you like a sort of disavow of human rights law
*11:03.260- 11:05.380* :  when it comes to the specific issue
*11:05.380- 11:07.040* :  of sending people to Rwanda,
*11:07.040- 11:09.020* :  but, of course, you know, you can bet your bottom dollar
*11:09.020- 11:12.180* :  vow, this, of course, is going to be challenged by lawyers
*11:12.260- 11:14.100* :  and it will be challenged by organisations
*11:14.200- 11:16.920* :  and, of course, by those earmarks for travel.
*11:17.440- 11:19.640* :  Rob Watson, well, this week the UK government
*11:19.640- 11:21.940* :  also unveiled plans which it says
*11:22.340- 11:24.140* :  will slash migration levels
*11:24.540- 11:26.800* :  and curb abuse of the immigration system,
*11:26.800- 11:30.460* :  delivering the biggest ever reduction in net migration.
*11:31.220- 11:32.940* :  At the moment, if a UK citizen
*11:32.940- 11:34.560* :  married someone who isn't British,
*11:34.560- 11:37.500* :  their spouse can reside with them here in the UK
*11:37.540- 11:41.720* :  as long as the UK citizen earns $33,000
*11:42.540- 11:45.140* :  or just over 26,000 pounds a year.
*11:45.700- 11:47.760* :  From next March, that figure will increase
*11:47.760- 11:52.500* :  to almost $50,000 a year or almost 39,000 pounds.
*11:52.540- 11:54.940* :  That's more than what three quarters
*11:54.940- 11:56.780* :  of the population takes home.
*11:57.480- 11:59.680* :  Raquel Roberts dos Santos has been married
*11:59.680- 12:01.640* :  to a Brazilian man for eight years.
*12:01.960- 12:03.400* :  They have two young sons,
*12:03.700- 12:05.820* :  as well as his 15-year-old daughter
*12:06.200- 12:07.500* :  from a previous relationship.
*12:08.120- 12:10.580* :  The family are split because he is allowed
*12:10.580- 12:12.380* :  to live here in the UK.
*12:13.220- 12:16.160* :  Raquel Roberts dos Santos spoke to Sarah Montague
*12:16.520- 12:19.920* :  about why this latest announcement is so heartbreaking.
*12:20.680- 12:21.640* :  I gained a job,
*12:22.000- 12:26.260* :  which was the equivalent of 31,000 pounds per annum salary.
*12:26.700- 12:27.360* :  Oh, my goodness.
*12:27.500- 12:29.280* :  So what you're now at a level
*12:29.600- 12:31.240* :  where if you had carried on,
*12:31.240- 12:33.000* :  you could have proved you had this wage
*12:33.000- 12:35.120* :  and your husband could have joined you,
*12:35.400- 12:37.320* :  but the goalpost just moved.
*12:37.760- 12:38.020* :  Correct.
*12:38.380- 12:40.840* :  They've taken the ground from underneath my feet.
*12:41.620- 12:42.800* :  They've destroyed my hope.
*12:43.460- 12:46.420* :  How can you sustain a marriage over that distance?
*12:46.900- 12:47.980* :  We communicate daily.
*12:48.600- 12:50.560* :  It is usually in the evening.
*12:50.900- 12:52.500* :  There is a four-hour time difference,
*12:52.580- 12:54.620* :  which obviously can complicate things.
*12:54.620- 12:58.240* :  We share every bit of news through face time,
*12:58.300- 13:01.760* :  through all the channels of communication available now.
*13:01.760- 13:04.200* :  We continue this long-distance relationship
*13:04.500- 13:07.340* :  and we will make it to be a family together again.
*13:07.960- 13:09.180* :  And that's what we all want.
*13:09.560- 13:11.080* :  Have you thought about moving to Brazil?
*13:11.540- 13:14.720* :  I thought our boys would have a better future in England.
*13:15.060- 13:17.020* :  I had had a gun put to my head
*13:17.020- 13:19.720* :  and my car stolen at gunpoint in Brazil.
*13:20.140- 13:22.740* :  I had been robbed breastfeeding in Brazil.
*13:23.400- 13:26.940* :  I nearly lost both boys in a public hospital in Brazil
*13:27.380- 13:30.560* :  and it was almost the time to think about school.
*13:31.020- 13:34.660* :  So I decided that it was better that we lived here
*13:34.940- 13:37.520* :  and that we would take the six-month separation
*13:38.080- 13:39.300* :  and I would earn the money
*13:39.300- 13:41.660* :  and we would see each other in six months.
*13:42.220- 13:43.960* :  And that's now four years, three months.
*13:44.580- 13:45.620* :  How do you feel about it?
*13:45.660- 13:47.400* :  Because obviously the center of this
*13:47.400- 13:49.840* :  is two people who clearly love each other very much.
*13:50.320- 13:53.520* :  Yes, we are absolutely resolute.
*13:53.760- 13:58.460* :  That no one or nothing can come between us and our family
*13:58.880- 14:02.060* :  and we will overcome this and we will be together.
*14:02.360- 14:05.540* :  The news from yesterday is so distressful.
*14:05.920- 14:07.340* :  It's left me distraught.
*14:07.440- 14:09.560* :  The school run was so hard this morning
*14:09.560- 14:11.200* :  when you see all those families,
*14:11.680- 14:13.960* :  you know, mums and dads walking their kids to school.
*14:13.960- 14:17.260* :  Something so normal that people take for granted.
*14:17.820- 14:19.980* :  There are thousands and thousands of families.
*14:20.580- 14:21.740* :  We're all in the same boat.
*14:21.740- 14:24.180* :  Even, you know, my boys, their school friends,
*14:24.180- 14:27.080* :  their parents, when you say we are separated
*14:27.080- 14:28.760* :  because I don't earn enough,
*14:29.200- 14:31.660* :  they look at you as so incredulous.
*14:31.660- 14:32.960* :  They're like, what do you mean?
*14:33.400- 14:34.000* :  But you're married.
*14:34.460- 14:35.960* :  Yes, and he's their father.
*14:36.340- 14:39.280* :  Yes, the repercussions of these rules,
*14:40.000- 14:42.800* :  it's not human to do this to people.
*14:43.500- 14:47.420* :  What they have done yesterday will also impact the UK population.
*14:47.420- 14:51.100* :  Basically, they've been told you cannot fall in love
*14:51.100- 14:51.960* :  with a foreigner.
*14:52.540- 14:54.100* :  Raquel Roberts, or Santos,
*14:54.100- 14:56.240* :  speaking there to Sarah Montague.
*14:57.220- 14:59.620* :  Sri Lanka's doctors, nurses and health technicians
*14:59.620- 15:02.040* :  are leaving the country in their droves,
*15:02.320- 15:04.480* :  putting pressure on the healthcare system.
*15:05.060- 15:07.880* :  Now, operations at a regional hospital have been halted
*15:08.200- 15:10.980* :  after the only surgeon in the area left Sri Lanka.
*15:11.560- 15:13.440* :  It comes after the country defaulted
*15:13.440- 15:15.140* :  on its foreign debt last year
*15:15.480- 15:18.080* :  amid the worst financial crisis in years.
*15:18.700- 15:20.600* :  I asked our South Asia Regional Editor
*15:20.600- 15:24.280* :  and Barathan Etheragen why so many doctors are immigrating.
*15:24.720- 15:25.920* :  You would be surprised to know
*15:26.080- 15:28.680* :  that Sri Lanka has one of the best healthcare systems
*15:28.680- 15:29.600* :  in South Asia.
*15:29.960- 15:32.100* :  The hospitals are good, very clean.
*15:32.160- 15:34.740* :  It used to be among the top in South Asia,
*15:34.740- 15:37.200* :  but the economic crisis changed everything
*15:37.460- 15:40.200* :  because the government was restricting the import of many items
*15:40.200- 15:42.580* :  and also the prices went up.
*15:42.580- 15:45.180* :  Many hospitals ran out of essential medicines.
*15:46.060- 15:48.540* :  Though the government managed to improve the situation,
*15:48.540- 15:49.900* :  allowed more imports,
*15:50.600- 15:52.360* :  the real problem is about
*15:52.360- 15:54.780* :  what kind of salary you can give to these doctors.
*15:54.840- 15:58.220* :  People are seeing that we don't have a future in Sri Lanka.
*15:58.420- 15:59.040* :  If you're a doctor,
*15:59.620- 16:01.940* :  it is easy for you to get a job overseas.
*16:02.820- 16:03.820* :  According to the government,
*16:04.360- 16:05.900* :  or in the last about 18 months,
*16:05.900- 16:08.380* :  more than 1,200 doctors,
*16:08.740- 16:10.380* :  a quarter of them are specialists.
*16:10.760- 16:13.140* :  These people having attained their specialization,
*16:13.240- 16:14.320* :  they are now leaving
*16:14.620- 16:16.840* :  because they want either to go for higher studies
*16:16.840- 16:19.260* :  and find a job or getting a job elsewhere.
*16:19.780- 16:23.020* :  So this is causing a huge concern for their authorities.
*16:23.580- 16:26.380* :  And this is having an impact on one of the hospitals.
*16:26.380- 16:29.340* :  Is there a key hospital in the eastern part of Sri Lanka?
*16:29.680- 16:30.740* :  And without a surgeon,
*16:31.380- 16:32.460* :  they're doing minus surgeries,
*16:32.760- 16:35.900* :  but not the big ones what a surgeon would do.
*16:36.420- 16:37.720* :  So how bad is the pay?
*16:37.840- 16:39.360* :  Because the obvious question is,
*16:39.360- 16:41.280* :  why don't they just pay doctors and nurses
*16:41.280- 16:42.580* :  and other medical staff more?
*16:43.520- 16:46.120* :  The unions, the health officials and health unions
*16:46.120- 16:47.820* :  have been negotiating with the government
*16:47.820- 16:50.120* :  because if you look at the inflation rate,
*16:50.120- 16:52.040* :  what happened, prices of food items,
*16:52.040- 16:53.440* :  like cooking gas cylinders,
*16:53.440- 16:55.020* :  have doubled in the last few years,
*16:55.020- 16:57.380* :  or even tripled electricity prices have gone up.
*16:57.700- 16:59.540* :  But the salaries are not matching
*17:00.020- 17:01.000* :  with what they were getting.
*17:01.600- 17:03.960* :  Number two, if you're going to give it to a health sector,
*17:04.480- 17:06.440* :  what happens to the other government departments,
*17:06.440- 17:09.340* :  though they are going to demand the same kind of salary.
*17:09.620- 17:11.380* :  So you are giving it to the health authorities,
*17:11.620- 17:12.260* :  why not to us?
*17:12.380- 17:15.300* :  So the government is also under severe economic stress,
*17:15.360- 17:17.020* :  even though they are increasing pay,
*17:17.180- 17:19.620* :  but not to the level of what is on the ground
*17:19.620- 17:20.860* :  in terms of inflation.
*17:21.620- 17:23.260* :  And Barrisan, Ethelogen.
*17:25.960- 17:27.760* :  Still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:28.100- 17:30.480* :  For sure, I do end up playing a lot of these kinds
*17:30.480- 17:33.600* :  of not terribly likable, unlikable people.
*17:33.740- 17:34.920* :  I can't fill this class.
*17:35.800- 17:37.400* :  Oh, don't say yourself short, Mr. Cotes.
*17:37.400- 17:38.400* :  I truly believe that you can.
*17:39.040- 17:41.580* :  The multi-award-winning actor, Paul Jamati,
*17:41.580- 17:43.900* :  on his new film, The Holdovers,
*17:44.360- 17:46.040* :  which has been tipped for NOSCA.
*17:54.360- 17:58.200* :  Let's return now to our main story, the situation in Gaza.
*17:58.760- 18:02.280* :  The US is now saying it will revoke existing visas
*18:02.280- 18:05.860* :  and future applications from hard-line Israeli settlers
*18:06.280- 18:08.440* :  who've carried out attacks against Palestinians
*18:08.440- 18:09.580* :  in the West Bank.
*18:10.100- 18:12.240* :  Washington also called on Palestinian officials
*18:12.240- 18:15.940* :  to do more to curb Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
*18:16.680- 18:18.640* :  The State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller
*18:19.040- 18:19.980* :  announced the new measures.
*18:20.720- 18:22.920* :  Today, the United States is taking action
*18:22.920- 18:25.300* :  to address this escalating violence in the West Bank
*18:25.300- 18:29.200* :  by implementing a new visa restriction policy under this policy.
*18:29.200- 18:31.100* :  The United States will pursue visa restrictions
*18:31.640- 18:35.020* :  against individuals involved in or meanfully contributing
*18:35.020- 18:37.820* :  to the undermining of peace, security,
*18:38.300- 18:39.740* :  or stability in the West Bank.
*18:40.300- 18:43.500* :  This includes acts of violence against persons or property,
*18:44.140- 18:46.360* :  as well as undue restrictions on civilians access
*18:46.360- 18:48.820* :  to essential services and basic necessities.
*18:49.320- 18:53.060* :  With more details, here's our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Asher.
*18:53.420- 18:55.560* :  The US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken
*18:55.560- 18:57.700* :  said the Biden administration had made clear
*18:57.700- 19:00.400* :  to the Israeli government the need to do more
*19:00.400- 19:02.840* :  to hold accountable extremist settlers
*19:02.840- 19:05.520* :  who commit violent acts against Palestinians.
*19:06.180- 19:09.420* :  The move to bar entry to the US to such individuals
*19:09.920- 19:11.260* :  and possibly even their families
*19:11.720- 19:14.040* :  sends a rare signal from Washington to Israel
*19:14.460- 19:16.160* :  that its patience has been exhausted
*19:16.660- 19:19.860* :  with the behavior of some Israelis towards Palestinians.
*19:20.480- 19:22.800* :  This year has seen several violent rampages
*19:22.800- 19:26.560* :  by settlers against Palestinian towns in the West Bank,
*19:26.940- 19:28.980* :  triggered by specific deadly attacks
*19:28.980- 19:31.040* :  by Palestinian government on Israelis
*19:31.620- 19:33.480* :  that bringing to the surface tensions
*19:33.540- 19:35.260* :  would have been seething for decades
*19:35.380- 19:38.400* :  as settlements have spread across the West Bank.
*19:39.140- 19:40.040* :  Sebastian Asher.
*19:40.760- 19:42.280* :  On yesterday's global news podcast,
*19:42.280- 19:43.920* :  we heard from an Israeli lawyer
*19:44.240- 19:47.920* :  who described horrific accounts of the brutal sexual violence
*19:48.400- 19:50.740* :  carried out by Hamas and other Palestinian groups
*19:50.740- 19:53.820* :  against Israeli women on October the 7th.
*19:54.380- 19:56.340* :  She was also critical of UN women,
*19:56.340- 19:58.460* :  which took eight weeks to condemn
*19:58.460- 20:00.020* :  that element of the attacks.
*20:00.640- 20:02.500* :  We've been trying since yesterday morning
*20:02.500- 20:04.480* :  to get an interview with UN women
*20:04.480- 20:06.420* :  to respond to those criticisms,
*20:07.040- 20:08.840* :  but so far without success.
*20:09.440- 20:11.820* :  However, they did send us this statement
*20:11.820- 20:14.160* :  part of which we voiced up.
*20:14.620- 20:17.940* :  UN women unequivocally condemns the opponent attacks
*20:17.940- 20:21.020* :  by Hamas against Israel on October 7th
*20:21.080- 20:22.720* :  and has been closely following reports
*20:22.720- 20:25.860* :  of brutal acts of gender-based violence against women
*20:25.860- 20:28.120* :  in Israel since they first came to light.
*20:28.560- 20:30.300* :  We recognize that UN procedures
*20:30.300- 20:31.940* :  can appear to be slow moving.
*20:32.480- 20:34.680* :  This is particularly true for public statements
*20:34.680- 20:36.740* :  on conflict-related sexual violence,
*20:36.740- 20:39.000* :  which require thorough investigation
*20:39.020- 20:40.920* :  by the commission of inquiry.
*20:41.520- 20:43.740* :  This approach has been a standard practice
*20:43.740- 20:46.720* :  in handling most past conflicts as well.
*20:47.320- 20:49.640* :  We condemned the attacks on civilians in Israel
*20:49.640- 20:52.160* :  in our first statement on October 13th.
*20:52.300- 20:54.520* :  Later that month, the executive director
*20:54.900- 20:56.880* :  decried the horrific attacks by Hamas
*20:57.020- 20:59.160* :  and clearly condemned every act of violence
*20:59.280- 21:00.620* :  against women and girls,
*21:00.960- 21:01.980* :  including sexual violence,
*21:01.980- 21:04.800* :  irrespective of nationality, identity, race,
*21:04.800- 21:06.300* :  or religion of the victims,
*21:06.760- 21:08.320* :  and called for the unconditional release
*21:08.320- 21:11.140* :  of all hostages at the UN Security Council.
*21:11.540- 21:14.500* :  We repeat our call for all accounts of gender-based violence
*21:14.500- 21:16.800* :  to be duly investigated and prosecuted
*21:16.800- 21:19.180* :  with the rights of the victim at the call.
*21:19.780- 21:21.800* :  A statement from UN women.
*21:22.480- 21:24.460* :  Watches worth more than $63 million
*21:24.500- 21:27.760* :  were reported stolen in London in 2022.
*21:28.660- 21:30.880* :  That's according to a freedom of information
*21:30.880- 21:33.000* :  and request to the Metropolitan Police.
*21:33.420- 21:35.240* :  The result has been shared exclusively
*21:35.240- 21:38.100* :  with the BBC by the International Database,
*21:38.360- 21:39.340* :  The Watch Register.
*21:39.920- 21:42.240* :  Some thefts involved violent ambushes
*21:42.260- 21:44.580* :  by thieves and mopedes and gangs
*21:44.580- 21:48.100* :  who specifically steal watches with thousands of dollars.
*21:48.100- 21:50.680* :  In one case, more than $200,000.
*21:51.980- 21:54.560* :  Teardondi has been making a BBC documentary
*21:54.560- 21:57.500* :  tracking down the criminals who steal watches
*21:57.900- 22:00.160* :  or snatch them from people on the streets.
*22:00.160- 22:02.140* :  And she spoke to James Reynolds.
*22:02.560- 22:04.980* :  I wanted to kind of see why these gangs
*22:04.980- 22:06.440* :  commit these violent crimes.
*22:06.760- 22:10.040* :  And I also hoped by exposing how these thieves operate,
*22:10.160- 22:11.560* :  it would help to spread awareness
*22:11.560- 22:13.300* :  and people could be more wary
*22:13.780- 22:15.220* :  when they're wearing watches on the street.
*22:15.540- 22:17.440* :  These crimes are extremely violent.
*22:17.440- 22:20.740* :  They're often wielding 13-inch machetes.
*22:20.740- 22:23.200* :  In one case, I actually saw a gun
*22:23.660- 22:24.960* :  when interviewing these criminals.
*22:24.960- 22:26.840* :  We do make sure that we challenge them.
*22:27.400- 22:30.140* :  I kind of push them as to why they steal these watches
*22:30.140- 22:32.080* :  and whether they have any remorse.
*22:32.440- 22:33.680* :  This does affect the people
*22:33.680- 22:36.500* :  that they commit these crimes on some of them.
*22:36.500- 22:39.120* :  Have PTSD, they're scared to walk alone at night.
*22:39.540- 22:40.560* :  Do they have any remorse?
*22:40.840- 22:42.020* :  Often actually know.
*22:42.480- 22:45.600* :  When I asked them, they said they didn't feel
*22:46.000- 22:47.060* :  any remorse for their victim.
*22:47.500- 22:49.940* :  Maybe it could have been a bit of a defense mechanism
*22:49.940- 22:52.560* :  because these gangs are going out
*22:52.560- 22:54.720* :  and committing these crimes so frequently.
*22:55.360- 22:57.860* :  I think they try to put it into the back of the head.
*22:58.240- 23:00.040* :  What their victims are feeling or thinking
*23:00.040- 23:02.340* :  in order to be able to commit these crimes.
*23:02.880- 23:04.860* :  Central London is the hotspot.
*23:05.240- 23:06.800* :  When I was spending time with these gangs,
*23:06.800- 23:11.680* :  we went to areas such as Knightsbridge, Chelsea, Mayfair.
*23:11.800- 23:14.380* :  And these are very well off parks, London, aren't they?
*23:14.380- 23:16.380* :  Exactly, so affluent areas.
*23:17.280- 23:21.320* :  And I actually went out with the gang leader who we call M
*23:21.800- 23:24.820* :  and he took me out spotting one night and showed me
*23:25.020- 23:27.420* :  how frequent it is that people are walking around
*23:27.420- 23:28.500* :  with these kind of watches.
*23:28.980- 23:30.980* :  M said in particular that he wouldn't rob something
*23:30.980- 23:33.180* :  that was less than 10,000 pounds.
*23:33.720- 23:35.380* :  And these gangs do this full time.
*23:35.420- 23:39.100* :  So they've actually learnt which watches which.
*23:39.100- 23:40.780* :  They've learnt how to spot a fake.
*23:40.780- 23:43.520* :  They've learnt how much money each watch is.
*23:43.960- 23:46.560* :  Sometimes they have even female spotters
*23:46.600- 23:48.360* :  that go into nightclubs and bars
*23:48.900- 23:50.520* :  and they look out for their victims
*23:50.520- 23:52.940* :  and then they call up the gang and the gang comes
*23:52.940- 23:54.500* :  and robs the watch off them.
*23:55.140- 23:57.680* :  The gangs have a network of contacts
*23:57.680- 23:59.880* :  and these watches get shifted onto them.
*24:00.260- 24:02.680* :  Different jewelry stores, different porn brokers,
*24:03.400- 24:05.160* :  sometimes even drug dealers they say.
*24:05.680- 24:08.620* :  And the watch register and the metropolitan police told me
*24:08.620- 24:11.420* :  that often these watches make their way out of the country
*24:11.420- 24:13.400* :  very quickly to places like Dubai.
*24:13.420- 24:15.260* :  They have serial numbers on them
*24:15.280- 24:17.000* :  so they're very easily traceable.
*24:17.480- 24:19.500* :  And so the quicker you can move the watch,
*24:19.860- 24:21.880* :  the less chance you've got of getting caught.
*24:22.340- 24:23.580* :  This crime is increasing.
*24:24.020- 24:27.480* :  The thieves are using increasingly dangerous tactics
*24:27.500- 24:29.440* :  in order to steal the watches.
*24:30.060- 24:30.960* :  Tier Dondi.
*24:31.720- 24:33.460* :  It's a rare record for a football team
*24:33.460- 24:36.460* :  to win all the matches they've played in one season,
*24:36.460- 24:38.540* :  especially one that's only just been formed.
*24:38.540- 24:40.680* :  But that's what a club in Turkmenistan
*24:40.680- 24:43.300* :  called Arkadag F.C. has achieved.
*24:43.980- 24:46.240* :  So what's the secret behind this success?
*24:47.080- 24:51.660* :  Ruslan Tobattlin is the editor of Chronicles of Turkmenistan Online.
*24:52.100- 24:53.980* :  They have yet four games to play
*24:53.980- 24:57.000* :  so it might go even up to 24 games
*24:57.000- 24:58.460* :  which wouldn't surprise me at all
*24:58.460- 25:02.440* :  because it was named after Gorbangolibia Timohamedov,
*25:02.600- 25:04.600* :  ex-president of Turkmenistan
*25:05.160- 25:08.560* :  and also a father of a current president of Turkmenistan.
*25:09.360- 25:12.460* :  So I guess that would be the secret power
*25:12.800- 25:14.320* :  behind this winning streak.
*25:14.580- 25:17.300* :  And a football fan contacted us and told us
*25:17.360- 25:20.700* :  that, well, this is taking all the fan out of the sports
*25:20.700- 25:22.360* :  because it seems that the referee
*25:22.360- 25:24.460* :  was actually helping Arkadag to win.
*25:24.960- 25:26.980* :  So the football team with the name Arkadag
*25:27.140- 25:29.600* :  apparently cannot lose in Turkmenistan.
*25:29.960- 25:33.500* :  And they're playing in a new city built specially
*25:33.500- 25:35.800* :  that cost what, five billion dollars?
*25:36.260- 25:38.400* :  I'm pretty sure that costs a lot more than that.
*25:38.400- 25:40.600* :  But yes, the new city is called Arkadag.
*25:40.880- 25:43.880* :  The city was built in honor of National Leader,
*25:44.100- 25:46.520* :  the Arkadag Gorbangolibia Timohamedov,
*25:46.520- 25:49.820* :  who has personally approved the design of the city,
*25:50.480- 25:53.980* :  design of all the houses, of all the roads,
*25:53.980- 25:56.360* :  fences and a lot more.
*25:56.600- 25:59.640* :  And he, of course, handed over a power to his son,
*25:59.640- 26:01.140* :  didn't he, in 2022?
*26:01.940- 26:03.420* :  So who is running the country?
*26:03.840- 26:05.260* :  Yes, since 2022,
*26:05.760- 26:07.740* :  the Arkadag Gorbangolibia Timohamedov came to power.
*26:08.320- 26:12.020* :  Although I strongly believe that his father, Gorbangolibia
*26:12.020- 26:13.460* :  actually still runs the country.
*26:13.940- 26:17.240* :  And Ruslan, how much support is there for this team,
*26:17.240- 26:20.860* :  which sounds like it's all about the honor of those in charge?
*26:20.860- 26:23.840* :  I think every football fan in Turkmenistan
*26:23.840- 26:26.180* :  understands that this team cannot lose,
*26:26.180- 26:29.300* :  so it doesn't make it interesting to be fan of the team.
*26:29.840- 26:31.960* :  After this 20 winning streak,
*26:32.060- 26:34.200* :  I would say, yeah, you're pretty much
*26:34.200- 26:36.660* :  sure that they're going to win every match.
*26:36.900- 26:39.600* :  Yeah, I would bet that they would win all 24.
*26:40.240- 26:41.680* :  Ruslan, Tobattalin.
*26:42.400- 26:44.200* :  And finally, for the last 20 years,
*26:44.340- 26:46.200* :  the American actor, Paul Jamati,
*26:46.200- 26:49.280* :  has excelled at playing outsiders, losers,
*26:49.780- 26:50.800* :  and the hard to love.
*26:51.300- 26:54.620* :  Think of his classic role as white snob miles in sideways,
*26:54.620- 26:57.320* :  who had a spectacular midlife crisis
*26:57.800- 26:59.860* :  while visiting vineyards in California.
*27:00.560- 27:03.060* :  That film was directed by Alexander Payne,
*27:03.260- 27:05.960* :  and the two have teamed up again for the Holdovers,
*27:05.960- 27:08.560* :  a film already creating Oscar buzz,
*27:08.880- 27:10.640* :  which is about a boarding school teacher,
*27:10.880- 27:13.580* :  looking after pupils who have nowhere to go at Christmas.
*27:14.320- 27:17.360* :  Paul Jamati has been speaking to our entertainment correspondent,
*27:17.900- 27:18.640* :  Colin Patterson.
*27:19.280- 27:21.340* :  You just earned your self-detention, so...
*27:21.340- 27:23.300* :  We feel we've always already won, we've been fan of you.
*27:23.300- 27:24.060* :  Son of a...
*27:24.960- 27:28.260* :  It's a classic American boarding school experience
*27:28.260- 27:29.420* :  in the depths of winter,
*27:29.980- 27:32.320* :  and these three people who have nowhere else to go
*27:32.320- 27:33.560* :  during the Christmas holidays.
*27:34.580- 27:35.480* :  Paul Jamati,
*27:35.480- 27:37.680* :  on playing history teacher, Paul Hunnam,
*27:37.860- 27:38.760* :  in the Holdovers,
*27:38.760- 27:41.380* :  a missing throat under the mistletoe.
*27:41.560- 27:42.760* :  I can't feel this class.
*27:43.620- 27:45.200* :  Oh, don't tell yourself short, Mr. Coat.
*27:45.200- 27:46.260* :  I truly believe that you can.
*27:47.300- 27:48.900* :  Set at the end of 1970,
*27:48.900- 27:51.140* :  this is a Christmas film with a difference,
*27:51.140- 27:55.540* :  and one very much expected to be in the mix during the war season.
*27:55.880- 27:57.500* :  Do you think I want to be babysitting you?
*27:58.080- 28:00.820* :  Oh, no, no. I was praying that your mother would pick up the phone,
*28:00.820- 28:03.500* :  or your father would arrive in a helicopter,
*28:03.500- 28:05.740* :  or a flying saucer to take you dead.
*28:07.140- 28:09.280* :  When it comes to the phrase character actor,
*28:09.820- 28:12.200* :  Paul Jamati could almost be the definition.
*28:12.460- 28:14.160* :  He has an issue with his eye.
*28:14.160- 28:16.280* :  He has excessively sweaty palms,
*28:16.280- 28:18.140* :  and he smells like fish.
*28:18.760- 28:20.040* :  It's a real condition, apparently.
*28:20.040- 28:22.360* :  And then he's also just an art ball.
*28:23.000- 28:26.160* :  This is something that you have visited throughout your career.
*28:26.220- 28:28.700* :  This idea of bringing humanity to people
*28:29.340- 28:31.180* :  who might not be that liked.
*28:31.580- 28:32.700* :  What's going on?
*28:32.740- 28:33.880* :  I don't know.
*28:33.880- 28:37.180* :  But for sure, I do end up playing a lot of these kinds of
*28:37.380- 28:39.980* :  not terribly likable, unlikable people.
*28:40.200- 28:41.420* :  You know, it used to be a student, right?
*28:41.420- 28:44.080* :  That's why he knows how to inflict maximum pain on him.
*28:44.640- 28:47.220* :  Paul Jamati knows all about boarding schools,
*28:47.220- 28:49.880* :  having attended one himself in Connecticut.
*28:50.400- 28:51.940* :  It's a little different being a day student.
*28:51.940- 28:54.520* :  I didn't have the full-on boarding school experience.
*28:54.720- 28:55.840* :  I was interested to hear, though,
*28:55.840- 28:57.720* :  that you actually filmed in a school
*28:57.720- 29:00.720* :  where you used to go for swim meets.
*29:02.460- 29:04.340* :  I had kind of forgotten I even went there
*29:04.500- 29:06.280* :  until we got there one night to shoot,
*29:06.320- 29:09.620* :  and I had this harrowing flashback going to a swimming
*29:09.620- 29:12.160* :  being in this miserable cold buzz with wet hair.
*29:12.360- 29:14.300* :  And it all came flooding back to me.
*29:16.180- 29:19.840* :  This is the first time he's teamed up with director Alexander Payne
*29:20.120- 29:22.680* :  since they had a huge hit almost 20 years ago
*29:22.680- 29:25.820* :  with the midlife crisis wine movie, Sideways.
*29:26.340- 29:27.720* :  If anybody orders me low, I'm leaving.
*29:27.720- 29:29.480* :  I am not drinking any more low.
*29:29.700- 29:32.000* :  And the story that always gets set up at Sideways
*29:32.100- 29:35.380* :  it did damage to Marlow's sales.
*29:35.800- 29:36.480* :  That's true.
*29:36.760- 29:37.560* :  Apparently, yes.
*29:37.660- 29:39.740* :  I mean, after the movie came out,
*29:40.140- 29:42.080* :  Tom Church and I were asked to do ads
*29:42.080- 29:43.740* :  for the Marlow growers of America
*29:43.740- 29:45.880* :  to try to rescue the sales.
*29:46.000- 29:46.860* :  We didn't do it,
*29:46.860- 29:50.540* :  but apparently only now, as it been in recovery.
*29:50.840- 29:53.280* :  I don't think I've ever had a real family Christmas like this before.
*29:53.440- 29:54.580* :  And while the holdovers
*29:54.580- 29:57.460* :  is not actually released in the UK until January,
*29:57.860- 30:00.800* :  Paul Giamatti believes it could become part of people's
*30:00.940- 30:02.280* :  annual festive traditions.
*30:02.340- 30:04.820* :  Yes, I think it's precisely the kind of thing
*30:04.820- 30:06.920* :  that people will watch at Christmas over and over again.
*30:07.040- 30:08.960* :  Give us a couple of examples of movies you are glad
*30:08.960- 30:10.220* :  they're in that Christmas canon.
*30:10.480- 30:12.920* :  Well, I mean, it's a wonderful life is a great movie.
