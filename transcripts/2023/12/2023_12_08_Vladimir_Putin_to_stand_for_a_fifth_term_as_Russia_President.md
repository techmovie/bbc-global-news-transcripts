*01:12.020- 01:14.960* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 14 hours GMT on Friday
*01:14.960- 01:17.180* :  the 8th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:17.820- 01:19.920* :  There's an important announcement from Russia's leader.
*01:20.280- 01:23.840* :  Now is such a time when a decision needs to be made.
*01:23.840- 01:27.700* :  I will run for the position of President of the Russian Federation.
*01:27.700- 01:29.780* :  In completely unsurprising news,
*01:29.780- 01:33.460* :  Vladimir Putin says he'll stand for another term as President.
*01:34.140- 01:36.540* :  As Israel's military continues to bombard Gaza,
*01:36.540- 01:38.480* :  there are more deaths in the West Bank.
*01:39.020- 01:42.540* :  And North Korea is using factories it operated with the South again,
*01:42.700- 01:43.840* :  but it didn't tell them.
*01:45.800- 01:50.360* :  Also in this podcast is Saudi Arabia using vast sums of money in sport
*01:50.360- 01:52.000* :  to change its image abroad.
*01:52.020- 01:54.100* :  We speak to a senior Saudi leader.
*01:54.580- 01:56.120* :  No one's perfect and we acknowledge that.
*01:56.540- 01:57.560* :  And we are reforming.
*01:58.260- 01:59.700* :  And these events help us reform.
*02:00.200- 02:02.060* :  And how do you find the best honey from bees?
*02:02.240- 02:04.480* :  Well, it's obvious isn't it? You ask the birds.
*02:08.760- 02:09.740* :  But let's start in Russia,
*02:09.940- 02:13.440* :  where Vladimir Putin has announced that he will stand for re-election
*02:13.440- 02:14.780* :  as the country's president.
*02:15.720- 02:17.420* :  During a televised meeting at the Kremlin,
*02:17.420- 02:19.920* :  with Russian soldiers who had fought in Ukraine,
*02:19.920- 02:22.460* :  Mr. Putin was praised for his determination.
*02:22.540- 02:26.600* :  And he was then asked whether he would run for president again in 2024.
*02:26.600- 02:29.700* :  His answer will have surprised just about nobody.
*02:30.280- 02:30.960* :  I see what you're saying.
*02:32.620- 02:33.440* :  Thank you very much.
*02:33.580- 02:36.140* :  I won't hide that at times I had different thoughts,
*02:36.140- 02:39.300* :  but now is such a time when a decision needs to be made.
*02:39.680- 02:43.040* :  I will run for the position of president of the Russian Federation.
*02:44.480- 02:46.640* :  Well, Vladimir Putin clearly wrestling with the decision.
*02:46.640- 02:48.760* :  Their voting is due to take place in March.
*02:48.760- 02:52.560* :  But also among those not surprised by this is my colleague Vitaly Shachenko.
*02:53.260- 02:54.860* :  This isn't a surprise at all.
*02:54.920- 02:58.580* :  In fact, a lot of people are wondering what is the point?
*02:58.580- 03:02.900* :  Why is Vladimir Putin even bothering holding elections?
*03:02.900- 03:08.360* :  Because political life, real political life is outlawed in Russia.
*03:09.280- 03:12.840* :  We know that if he runs, he is going to win
*03:12.840- 03:16.640* :  unless he chooses to appoint somebody else to win, which is unlikely.
*03:17.560- 03:23.700* :  But the answer to that is like so many strongman leaders across the world
*03:23.700- 03:27.020* :  who have been accused of being dictators,
*03:28.040- 03:30.840* :  very few of them admit being dictators.
*03:30.840- 03:35.380* :  A lot of them are very keen to maintain this democratic facade.
*03:36.140- 03:41.600* :  So that's why Vladimir Putin is heavily focused on procedure and laws
*03:41.600- 03:46.180* :  and what he calls managed democracy.
*03:46.520- 03:48.640* :  OK, but obviously I sense your skepticism there,
*03:48.640- 03:51.780* :  but on the face of it, Russia has a democratic system,
*03:51.780- 03:53.540* :  doesn't it, where it elects its president?
*03:53.540- 03:55.120* :  What's the process going to be?
*03:55.420- 04:04.280* :  There are a number of parties, but the fact is that genuine opponents of Vladimir Putin
*04:05.140- 04:09.260* :  have ended up in jail, in exile, or dead.
*04:09.660- 04:12.260* :  In fact, over the past few days, we've seen a story
*04:13.060- 04:18.840* :  about a campaign launched by supporters of Alexey Navalny,
*04:18.840- 04:24.340* :  who is the most prominent Russian opposition leader, who is in jail, of course.
*04:24.960- 04:31.800* :  So these people, they put up a huge post as a cross-Russia saying Russia and a QR code.
*04:31.800- 04:37.900* :  But if you scan that QR code, it takes you to an anti-Putin website.
*04:38.460- 04:40.960* :  Guess what happened to those posters that have been removed?
*04:40.960- 04:45.340* :  Because genuine opposition to Vladimir Putin is outlawed.
*04:45.680- 04:53.220* :  And whatever parties are going to be allowed to run in those elections next March,
*04:53.840- 05:01.240* :  they are possibly going to make vaguely mildly critical statements of Vladimir Putin.
*05:02.020- 05:08.740* :  But they will stop short of challenging his policies in real terms.
*05:08.940- 05:14.640* :  OK, so it's your view that the world, be you in Ukraine or be you in China or anywhere else,
*05:14.640- 05:16.920* :  should prepare for another six years of Vladimir Putin?
*05:17.200- 05:21.680* :  At least, because that's what the system is geared up to do.
*05:21.680- 05:24.240* :  That's what the system is designed to do.
*05:24.740- 05:28.380* :  It is designed to make sure that Vladimir Putin stays in power.
*05:28.380- 05:36.460* :  In fact, it's interesting how Russia's official state news agency TAS reported the announcement.
*05:36.460- 05:38.640* :  That Vladimir Putin is going to run for president.
*05:38.700- 05:42.920* :  It's said that he has agreed to run for president.
*05:42.920- 05:44.600* :  And he's being urged by people, apparently.
*05:44.860- 05:50.420* :  That's what his spokesman, Mita Piskov said, that there are so many people rising in,
*05:50.420- 05:54.400* :  urging him to run again, that he didn't really have much choice, but agree.
*05:54.940- 05:57.320* :  Vitaly Chevchenko, and just a quick aside to that,
*05:57.320- 06:00.720* :  if you look at the story we have on this at BBC News Online, you will see this.
*06:01.180- 06:05.880* :  Vladimir Putin, who is 71, has already been in power in Russia longer than any ruler
*06:05.880- 06:09.800* :  since Joseph Stalin, and a new term, if he was successful,
*06:09.800- 06:13.100* :  would see him remain as president until at least 2030.
*06:14.580- 06:16.760* :  Now, the war in Gaza is in its third month,
*06:16.760- 06:21.100* :  as the humanitarian situation for hundreds of thousands of Gaza's worsens,
*06:21.100- 06:26.460* :  Israel's military continues its heavy bombardment amid intense fighting with Hamas.
*06:27.000- 06:30.580* :  Overnight, hundreds more targets were struck across the Gaza Strip.
*06:31.000- 06:34.020* :  Local journalists describe the intensity of those attacks.
*06:34.060- 06:36.960* :  Khosam Shabbat reports from the north of Gaza.
*06:39.340- 06:42.460* :  The Israeli army deployed a substantial number of smoke bombs,
*06:42.460- 06:46.020* :  resulting in numerous injuries and individuals struggling to breathe.
*06:46.800- 06:49.340* :  Several houses, cars and tents in shelter centers
*06:49.860- 06:52.040* :  are engulfed in large, uncontrollable fires.
*06:52.420- 06:56.760* :  As of now, there's a state of severe panic and terror among the citizens in the shelter schools
*06:57.320- 06:58.780* :  where no one can take effective action.
*06:59.200- 07:01.320* :  Everyone is trapped amidst the bombs and fires,
*07:01.800- 07:03.940* :  and despite the absence of advancing army tanks,
*07:03.940- 07:07.260* :  the surroundings are dominated by constant smoke bombs and fire.
*07:07.780- 07:10.080* :  Well, as the aerial campaign escalates,
*07:10.080- 07:15.580* :  pressure on Israel has been growing to allow desperately needed humanitarian supplies into Gaza.
*07:16.160- 07:19.340* :  Hannah Bond, from the Charity Action Aid UK, told the BBC
*07:19.340- 07:23.400* :  that sufficient volumes of basic supplies were still not getting in.
*07:23.980- 07:26.200* :  The situation is absolutely catastrophic.
*07:26.980- 07:30.940* :  People are lacking in food, in water, in fuel, to cook food.
*07:30.940- 07:36.100* :  Hospitals are lacking in fuel to be able to have operations
*07:36.300- 07:38.160* :  and to do those really important surgeries.
*07:38.820- 07:41.820* :  We're hearing from our partner in northern Gaza
*07:41.820- 07:44.520* :  that they are having to operate with strapped and flying around.
*07:45.340- 07:48.380* :  The government of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*07:48.380- 07:52.840* :  has said that facilities at another crossing into the territory would be opened soon.
*07:53.600- 07:55.800* :  The bloodshed has also been increasing on the West Bank,
*07:55.800- 07:58.420* :  where officials say six Palestinians were killed,
*07:58.420- 08:01.300* :  when Israeli soldiers stormed a refugee camp there.
*08:02.000- 08:03.520* :  Just before we recorded this podcast,
*08:03.520- 08:06.700* :  I spoke to our correspondent Anna Foster, who's in Jerusalem.
*08:07.420- 08:10.720* :  We have seen over the last week this increasing bombardment,
*08:10.720- 08:12.940* :  particularly since a week ago today,
*08:12.940- 08:16.820* :  that brief ceasefire deal that lasted a week broke down
*08:16.820- 08:19.540* :  and I was there, you know, in St. Rotten, Southern Israel,
*08:19.540- 08:23.820* :  looking out across Gaza when we heard the fighting start to resume.
*08:23.820- 08:27.940* :  And since then, the focus which had very much been the north of Gaza
*08:28.380- 08:30.800* :  has also started to move south as well.
*08:30.800- 08:34.840* :  So we're really seeing these intense bombardments up and down the strip.
*08:34.840- 08:39.740* :  Israel say that they are continuing to focus on Hamas' infrastructure,
*08:39.740- 08:43.720* :  particularly in areas in the north like the Jabalya refugee camp, for example,
*08:43.720- 08:47.420* :  but also around that large southern city of Han Unis as well.
*08:47.420- 08:51.000* :  But I think Israel has had it made very clear to them
*08:51.000- 08:53.420* :  that this is not an open-ended war
*08:53.420- 08:58.640* :  and that there will be eventually a time limit put on this conflict.
*08:58.740- 09:00.980* :  Can I talk to you about the pressure that the Israel's government
*09:00.980- 09:03.180* :  is under to open some more crossings
*09:03.180- 09:05.940* :  to increase the humanitarian aid into Gaza?
*09:05.940- 09:09.740* :  I mean, Benjamin Netanyahu's government saying that they are going to open part,
*09:09.740- 09:11.000* :  I think, at the Karen Shalom.
*09:11.000- 09:13.360* :  How important is the humanitarian effort
*09:13.400- 09:15.680* :  in particular, its ability to go through these places?
*09:15.980- 09:17.320* :  So Karen Shalom will help.
*09:17.320- 09:20.740* :  But basically, it offers an extra space where those checks can be done
*09:20.740- 09:24.040* :  because every one of those humanitarian aid lorries that goes in
*09:24.460- 09:26.700* :  needs to be thoroughly checked, first of all.
*09:26.700- 09:30.380* :  So Karen Shalom gives them an extra staging post to do that
*09:30.420- 09:31.680* :  and it will improve the flow.
*09:31.680- 09:32.840* :  It will make things quicker.
*09:33.380- 09:36.040* :  But you still really have the raffer crossing
*09:36.040- 09:40.100* :  as the sole crossing that that aid is actually passing through.
*09:40.500- 09:43.960* :  There are signs that that flow is starting to get a little better,
*09:43.960- 09:46.780* :  but it's still a long way away from where it needs to be
*09:46.780- 09:50.060* :  to help all of those civilians in Gaza who need it.
*09:50.200- 09:53.980* :  And just finally, much of our reporting focuses on the military campaign
*09:53.980- 09:55.620* :  and the confrontation in the Gaza Strip,
*09:55.620- 09:59.300* :  but I think there's more violence and there are a bit more deaths in the West Bank
*09:59.300- 10:01.260* :  and the funerals have they started yet today?
*10:01.540- 10:03.500* :  Yeah, there have been six funerals today.
*10:03.500- 10:06.640* :  And there's a good point because this is the kind of thing
*10:06.640- 10:09.640* :  that would very much be the focus of the world's attention.
*10:09.680- 10:12.260* :  If it was happening in a different context,
*10:12.260- 10:15.620* :  large numbers of Palestinians in the West Bank
*10:15.620- 10:18.200* :  who've been killed since the 7th of October,
*10:18.880- 10:23.360* :  the West Bank had been boiling really for a long time before that.
*10:23.360- 10:28.480* :  So this is not something that's just been provoked solely by the 7th of October.
*10:28.500- 10:32.220* :  There was already a great deal of anger and frustration in the West Bank areas
*10:32.220- 10:34.440* :  like Nablus, like Janine.
*10:34.500- 10:37.860* :  This again is something that needs to be looked at and it's important.
*10:37.880- 10:42.440* :  It needs to be looked at in the wider context of what is happening in Gaza
*10:42.980- 10:47.880* :  and also in the wider context of how some sort of resolution to this conflict
*10:47.880- 10:51.660* :  is sought because it's not just about finding an answer for Gaza.
*10:51.660- 10:56.160* :  It's about finding an answer that tries to work for the whole of this area
*10:56.160- 10:58.300* :  for the occupied West Bank as well as Gaza.
*10:58.680- 11:02.360* :  But as we know through decades and decades of negotiations
*11:02.580- 11:04.780* :  and attempts to try and find an answer,
*11:05.160- 11:06.980* :  very often it proves to be out of reach.
*11:07.520- 11:08.760* :  Anna Foster in Jerusalem.
*11:09.460- 11:13.480* :  In the US, President Biden's son Hunter has been charged with tax evasion
*11:13.900- 11:17.200* :  as part of an investigation into his personal and business dealings.
*11:17.680- 11:21.900* :  Prosecutors say he took part in a scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4 million.
*11:22.940- 11:27.180* :  Hunter Biden's lawyers say if his client had a different name, there would be no charges.
*11:27.880- 11:28.860* :  David Willis has more.
*11:29.520- 11:34.380* :  The 56-page indictment alleges Hunter Biden earned millions of dollars
*11:34.380- 11:37.360* :  from foreign entities in China and Ukraine
*11:37.460- 11:42.820* :  and used much of it to fund what prosecutors call an extravagant lifestyle,
*11:43.440- 11:47.160* :  one that included drugs, prostitutes and exotic cars.
*11:47.780- 11:53.720* :  He's accused of plotting to avoid paying taxes between the years 2016 and 2019
*11:53.780- 11:57.620* :  and filing a false tax assessment for the year 2018.
*11:58.400- 12:03.380* :  Hunter Biden had already been accused in September of lying about his drug use
*12:03.660- 12:10.260* :  in order to buy a handgun, the first criminal prosecution of a sitting American president's child.
*12:10.860- 12:15.660* :  If convicted of the latest charges, he faces up to 17 years in prison.
*12:16.260- 12:17.160* :  David Willis reporting.
*12:17.620- 12:21.820* :  North Korea is thought to have reopened 30 factories at an industrial park
*12:21.820- 12:26.020* :  that was built by South Korea, even though that park is supposed to be closed.
*12:26.560- 12:30.620* :  Seoul said Pyongyang had restarted facilities at the Gaseong Industrial Complex,
*12:30.700- 12:34.480* :  which is built on the northern side of the border dividing both countries.
*12:35.140- 12:39.100* :  When it opened many years ago, it was seen as an important step towards cooperation
*12:39.160- 12:40.600* :  between the two Koreas.
*12:41.220- 12:43.500* :  East Asia editor Mickey Brister told me more.
*12:44.060- 12:46.980* :  It's easy to forget such a time existed, really,
*12:46.980- 12:50.460* :  because over the last few years, we've heard quite a lot about tension
*12:50.460- 12:53.020* :  between North and South Korea and North Korea testing.
*12:54.020- 12:59.320* :  Missiles recently put a satellite into space, a military spy satellite.
*12:59.320- 13:03.200* :  And so it's hard sometimes to remember that 20 years ago,
*13:03.200- 13:06.980* :  there was something called a sunshine policy where the two Koreas got together
*13:06.980- 13:09.600* :  and actually relations were quite warm.
*13:10.000- 13:13.400* :  And there were a number of projects which they took part in together
*13:13.400- 13:19.020* :  to try and cement those ties and the Gaseong Industrial Complex was one of those.
*13:19.960- 13:22.780* :  And at its height, it was quite a big deal.
*13:22.780- 13:28.960* :  Really, there were 120 odd South Korean companies operating factories in this site
*13:28.960- 13:32.740* :  just over the border on the northern side of the border into North Korea.
*13:33.460- 13:38.160* :  And it employed more than 1.50,000 North Korean workers,
*13:38.160- 13:41.840* :  as well as hundreds who used to travel every day from the South.
*13:42.340- 13:46.200* :  And this isn't an awful lot of money, not just for those North Korean workers,
*13:46.200- 13:48.360* :  but for the North Korean economy.
*13:48.360- 13:53.740* :  Remember at the time, North Korea was just coming out of a really major famine
*13:53.740- 13:56.360* :  as really trying to reorganize its economy.
*13:56.360- 13:58.440* :  So it was a really big deal.
*13:59.020- 14:02.820* :  Occasionally over the years, it closed down a little bit because of tension
*14:02.880- 14:06.660* :  and then in 2016, it closed finally, the South Koreans closed it down
*14:06.660- 14:10.700* :  because of the continuing weapons programs by North Korea.
*14:11.300- 14:12.700* :  So, all right, seven years on.
*14:13.140- 14:15.500* :  I mean, this is a very significant investment, wasn't it?
*14:15.540- 14:18.160* :  What do you think is actually happening now?
*14:18.860- 14:22.600* :  Well, what's been happening since then, according to the South Koreans,
*14:22.600- 14:24.460* :  is these factories essentially have been idle,
*14:24.460- 14:26.680* :  they've just been sitting there not used.
*14:27.160- 14:31.440* :  But this year, the South Koreans started to notice that there was some activity
*14:32.380- 14:36.020* :  at some of these sites, mainly through satellite imagery,
*14:36.020- 14:41.860* :  noticing workers turning up in buses, a lot more activity around some of the factories.
*14:42.420- 14:46.200* :  Early this year, they suggested that perhaps ten of the facilities were being used.
*14:46.700- 14:50.160* :  Now, they've come out and said that there's 30 or so, they think,
*14:50.160- 14:56.700* :  30 factories being used illegally in South Korean terms by the North Koreans.
*14:57.180- 15:00.060* :  Because essentially, these are South Korean factories, South Korean facilities
*15:00.060- 15:03.920* :  and the North Koreans just seem to be operating them.
*15:04.040- 15:05.800* :  And just very, very quickly, I think I know the answer.
*15:05.800- 15:07.900* :  So, what's Pyongyang to stop? Is it going to stop?
*15:08.940- 15:09.500* :  Probably not.
*15:10.560- 15:11.080* :  Mickey Brister.
*15:11.800- 15:14.180* :  French police say they've arrested two men in Strasbourg
*15:14.180- 15:18.200* :  for defrauding old people by pretending to eradicate bedbugs.
*15:18.720- 15:22.700* :  France has been gripped by a nationwide panic over the insects since October.
*15:23.440- 15:24.320* :  Huescofield explains.
*15:25.000- 15:27.640* :  The two men were arrested in the eastern city of Strasbourg
*15:27.640- 15:29.940* :  where it's alleged they'd fine-tuned their racket.
*15:30.280- 15:34.620* :  Phony up elderly women with a claim that bedbugs had been detected in their area
*15:35.080- 15:39.060* :  and then insisting on a home visit to treat the non-existent infestation.
*15:39.460- 15:41.800* :  After spraying the walls with a basic cleaning product
*15:41.800- 15:44.060* :  and offering an ointment for skin protection,
*15:44.060- 15:47.520* :  they then charged hundreds of euros on the person's bank card.
*15:47.800- 15:50.660* :  All together, 48 victims have been detected, police said.
*15:51.020- 15:55.420* :  October's bedbugs care was fueled by a huge amount of coverage on social media
*15:55.800- 16:01.020* :  and consumers groups in France have warned that many of the offers of professional help available online
*16:01.480- 16:02.500* :  are not to be trusted.
*16:03.120- 16:03.700* :  Huescofield.
*16:06.280- 16:07.800* :  Coming up in the Global News Podcast,
*16:07.800- 16:09.620* :  at the Climate Change Conference in Dubai,
*16:09.620- 16:11.740* :  we hear about reasons to be cheerful.
*16:12.080- 16:15.740* :  In China across 2023, they're on track to add more solar
*16:16.120- 16:18.220* :  than the United States has ever installed.
*16:18.220- 16:22.740* :  Even in Britain, some 17,000 homes a month are installing panels.
*16:28.940- 16:29.820* :  Something mysterious,
*16:29.820- 16:32.220* :  plagues County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland
*16:32.220- 16:34.460* :  and its legendary Galic football team.
*16:34.720- 16:35.680* :  I believe in the curse.
*16:35.940- 16:37.380* :  Yeah, I think it's real.
*16:37.680- 16:39.020* :  Is it just superstition?
*16:39.400- 16:40.880* :  Or could there be more to it?
*16:41.100- 16:44.200* :  Sometimes I think there's something sinister going on.
*16:44.440- 16:46.980* :  What do we need to do to win an all-on-final for Mayo?
*16:47.360- 16:50.180* :  Listen to the curious tale of the Mayo Curse

*17:30.520- 17:32.580* :  Hello and welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*17:32.740- 17:34.400* :  There are military developments
*17:34.400- 17:36.320* :  in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*17:36.900- 17:40.140* :  where an East African regional force is with drawing its troops.
*17:40.820- 17:42.780* :  The soldiers were sent to the east of the DRC
*17:42.900- 17:44.580* :  at the request of the Congolese government
*17:44.580- 17:47.540* :  with a mandate that included helping retake areas
*17:47.540- 17:50.760* :  that have been seized by the M23 rebel group.
*17:51.400- 17:52.980* :  But President Felix Tishikadi,
*17:53.060- 17:54.660* :  who is up for re-election soon,
*17:55.100- 17:57.160* :  has criticized them for being ineffective,
*17:57.800- 18:00.620* :  as our senior Africa correspondent and saw it all me.
*18:01.120- 18:03.680* :  From the point of view of government in Kinshasa,
*18:03.880- 18:06.160* :  and it's very interesting that it's coming just days
*18:06.160- 18:08.240* :  to a very important election.
*18:08.240- 18:10.860* :  So these forces have already started with drawing.
*18:10.860- 18:14.940* :  We understand that that exercise will go on until January.
*18:14.940- 18:17.000* :  They're supposed to be replaced by forces
*18:17.000- 18:20.120* :  from the South African Development Community.
*18:20.120- 18:23.100* :  The DRC is part of that Sadak community,
*18:24.040- 18:27.420* :  but it is not clear when that replacement will happen.
*18:28.260- 18:31.720* :  And the rebel groups we mentioned to M23 just before we spoke to you.
*18:31.720- 18:35.880* :  Any reaction from them in terms of operations on the ground
*18:35.880- 18:36.880* :  or any kind of statement?
*18:37.240- 18:38.660* :  We have seen enough, essentially,
*18:38.660- 18:40.840* :  been trying to extend their territory.
*18:41.340- 18:42.620* :  And as late as yesterday,
*18:42.620- 18:44.500* :  they took a town called Mushaku,
*18:44.500- 18:48.680* :  which is just about 40 kilometers from the capital of North Kivu,
*18:48.680- 18:51.100* :  the province that has all these troubles.
*18:52.700- 18:55.600* :  So they're continuing with that campaign.
*18:55.600- 18:58.880* :  They had been dialogue before,
*18:59.060- 19:01.960* :  and they had agreed to let go of some of the territory
*19:01.960- 19:03.260* :  that they had taken previously,
*19:03.800- 19:06.900* :  which was then to be taken over by the forces
*19:06.900- 19:08.180* :  that are now withdrawing.
*19:08.500- 19:10.380* :  So we are seeing that as a very clear reaction
*19:10.380- 19:12.440* :  to the withdrawal of these forces.
*19:12.440- 19:14.700* :  The extension of territory that they control.
*19:14.920- 19:16.780* :  And just briefly, the election that's coming up,
*19:16.780- 19:19.520* :  I mean, the extent to which there's faith in the legitimacy
*19:19.520- 19:22.700* :  and this is going to be a transparent exercise.
*19:22.940- 19:25.620* :  Well, that's what the government is promising to deliver,
*19:25.620- 19:28.300* :  but there are also already questions being asked.
*19:28.300- 19:31.180* :  The European Union has withdrawn its observer mission
*19:31.180- 19:33.520* :  saying that they are no security guarantees
*19:34.220- 19:37.840* :  for their observers who are already in the capital Kinshasa,
*19:38.260- 19:41.580* :  but they wanted to travel outside and around the country,
*19:41.580- 19:43.180* :  but there are no security guarantees.
*19:43.180- 19:47.180* :  And therefore, it puts to question the credibility
*19:47.320- 19:49.980* :  and the transparency that the upcoming election
*19:50.020- 19:51.100* :  is going to be held in.
*19:51.520- 19:53.580* :  And so I'm talking to me from Nairobi.
*19:53.760- 19:54.960* :  Well, let's stay on the continent
*19:54.960- 19:57.180* :  because congestion at a key African port
*19:57.540- 19:59.500* :  is causing potential supply problems
*19:59.500- 20:01.280* :  ahead of the busy Christmas period.
*20:01.920- 20:04.320* :  Some 60 ships, each laden with thousands
*20:04.320- 20:07.940* :  of large packed shipping containers, a stuck at Durban Harbor.
*20:08.360- 20:10.820* :  It's the largest and busiest shipping terminal
*20:10.820- 20:12.040* :  in Sub-Saharan Africa.
*20:12.660- 20:14.920* :  Victoria Oon Kunda spoke to Ian Petty,
*20:14.920- 20:17.920* :  who's the managing director of a worldwide relocation firm
*20:18.220- 20:18.880* :  in Johannesburg.
*20:19.440- 20:22.360* :  There are about 60,000, 70,000 containers stranded out
*20:22.360- 20:24.260* :  in the sea outside of the Durban port.
*20:24.860- 20:28.640* :  There's around 50, 60 vessels in total that are out at sea.
*20:29.120- 20:33.100* :  We flew over helicopters over the harbor a few days ago.
*20:33.460- 20:35.740* :  There are many empty berths and idle cranes
*20:35.900- 20:37.420* :  in the Durban harbor near Durban port.
*20:38.000- 20:39.980* :  And our biggest issue is the transnet
*20:39.980- 20:43.060* :  who is a peristate or running our Durban ports
*20:43.060- 20:44.640* :  are trying to do a lot,
*20:44.640- 20:48.280* :  but they haven't embraced digitalization.
*20:48.820- 20:52.320* :  We are sitting with lots of infrastructure problems
*20:52.500- 20:54.280* :  where we haven't been maintaining gantries.
*20:54.540- 20:58.040* :  And so we're sitting in an absolute pandemonium,
*20:58.040- 20:59.480* :  particularly in our before Christmas,
*20:59.480- 21:02.280* :  as they say that the 60, 70,000 containers
*21:02.280- 21:04.760* :  are going to take at least 18 weeks to clear.
*21:05.320- 21:06.480* :  And that's going to be well off to Christmas.
*21:06.480- 21:10.980* :  So unfortunately, retail stores are in big in diastrates.
*21:11.300- 21:12.700* :  You call it a pandemonium,
*21:12.700- 21:15.660* :  retail's in diastrates and 18 weeks,
*21:15.700- 21:19.600* :  but we recently spoke to the CEO at the Durban Chamber of Commerce
*21:19.600- 21:22.080* :  who told us that things were improving.
*21:22.480- 21:26.040* :  A few days ago, the transnet did sign an agreement
*21:26.040- 21:28.060* :  with they called the OEM,
*21:28.060- 21:29.720* :  which is original manufacturers
*21:29.720- 21:32.240* :  of all the different equipment they have in port.
*21:32.740- 21:35.160* :  They reckon it's going to be in the next two weeks,
*21:35.160- 21:39.380* :  a 30% increase in the straddle carrier capacity,
*21:40.000- 21:43.760* :  but the OEMs are sign a prioritising a three-month list
*21:44.240- 21:45.160* :  for demand material.
*21:45.160- 21:47.480* :  So in other words, they're prioritising over three months.
*21:47.480- 21:49.640* :  So three months ain't going to help us for Christmas.
*21:49.640- 21:52.260* :  So they are trying to do everything.
*21:52.260- 21:54.380* :  They did it also six months ago.
*21:54.540- 21:57.620* :  We signed an agreement, a 15-year contract agreement
*21:57.620- 21:59.500* :  with a Philippine terminal operator.
*22:00.160- 22:01.500* :  And that was six months ago.
*22:01.580- 22:02.820* :  And they're still not on the ground
*22:02.840- 22:05.300* :  because of transnet leadership void.
*22:05.300- 22:08.040* :  There's a problem trying to hand over to them.
*22:08.320- 22:11.060* :  And the Philippine terminal operator
*22:11.480- 22:13.480* :  has certainly got all they've embraced,
*22:13.480- 22:17.300* :  all the maritime digitisation that we need desperately in port
*22:17.300- 22:20.160* :  to help us streamline and get containers moving
*22:20.160- 22:21.840* :  in and out of Durban port.
*22:22.460- 22:24.220* :  Empeti, who works in relocation,
*22:24.220- 22:25.880* :  speaking there from Johannesburg.
*22:26.840- 22:30.440* :  Saudi Arabia is going to host the 2034 football world cup.
*22:30.800- 22:32.240* :  It's just signed up a top golfer
*22:32.240- 22:34.280* :  its controversial live golf tour
*22:34.280- 22:37.440* :  with a reported $300 million payday.
*22:37.800- 22:41.060* :  And it's hoping to become a global hub for big boxing bouts.
*22:41.620- 22:43.500* :  All that, as it tries to modernise
*22:43.500- 22:45.900* :  and change its image on the world stage.
*22:46.560- 22:49.480* :  Or part, though, of what critics say, is sport-washing.
*22:50.060- 22:51.280* :  While our sports editor, Dan Rowan,
*22:51.280- 22:55.220* :  met Saudi sports minister, Prince Abdelaziz bin Turkey al-Faisal,
*22:55.600- 22:56.540* :  to test those claims.
*22:57.780- 23:03.060* :  It's the country transforming the sporting landscape,
*23:03.580- 23:04.840* :  whether it's shaking up football,
*23:06.220- 23:08.120* :  or the hosting of boxing's biggest fights,
*23:08.120- 23:11.280* :  Saudi Arabia's investments have gone into overdrive,
*23:11.700- 23:13.580* :  and the man overseeing it all told me
*23:13.580- 23:16.080* :  what lies behind this sporting revolution.
*23:16.720- 23:19.440* :  Our ambition is to host the best events around the world,
*23:19.440- 23:22.240* :  end the kingdom for the people of the kingdom to see,
*23:22.240- 23:24.880* :  but also to invite the world to the kingdom.
*23:25.080- 23:27.080* :  Do you want to be the sort of number one sporting superpower?
*23:27.080- 23:29.780* :  I don't see it that we're competing with others.
*23:29.780- 23:32.900* :  20 million of our population are below the age of 30,
*23:33.400- 23:34.380* :  so we need to get them engaged.
*23:37.840- 23:41.460* :  Al-Helal versus Al-Nasser in the Saudi pro league.
*23:42.060- 23:44.960* :  Clubs here spend three-quarters of a billion pounds
*23:44.960- 23:46.600* :  signing top stars this summer,
*23:46.920- 23:48.500* :  sending shockwaves through the game.
*23:49.240- 23:51.060* :  While the Riyadh Derby is a sellout,
*23:51.340- 23:53.680* :  some matches have been watched by just a few hundred fans.
*23:54.860- 23:57.500* :  Having lured some of the game's biggest names here,
*23:57.500- 24:00.420* :  Saudi Arabia's remarkable spending spree,
*24:00.420- 24:02.620* :  both in the pro league and beyond,
*24:02.660- 24:06.700* :  is generating plenty of hype and potentially growth too.
*24:06.920- 24:09.820* :  But it's also forcing sports to confront difficult questions
*24:09.820- 24:12.600* :  over the disruption that all this investment is causing,
*24:12.660- 24:15.020* :  and the motivation that lies behind it.
*24:15.640- 24:18.540* :  Despite fears over the environmental impact and concerns
*24:18.540- 24:21.500* :  that sports use to improve the reputation of a country
*24:21.500- 24:22.920* :  where women's rights are restricted
*24:22.920- 24:24.600* :  and homosexuality is illegal,
*24:24.600- 24:27.800* :  the world cups now set to come here in 2034.
*24:28.060- 24:31.200* :  For those who say that Saudi Arabia is not a suitable host,
*24:31.480- 24:32.560* :  what would your message be to them?
*24:32.560- 24:34.360* :  We hosted a lot of events in the past,
*24:34.380- 24:35.560* :  more than 85 events.
*24:36.340- 24:37.480* :  Everyone's welcome in the kingdom.
*24:38.840- 24:41.080* :  Like any other nations around the world,
*24:41.080- 24:43.920* :  we have rules and regulations that everyone should abide
*24:43.940- 24:44.940* :  by and respect.
*24:45.520- 24:47.320* :  So when you're accused of sports washing,
*24:47.320- 24:48.160* :  does that frustrate you?
*24:48.260- 24:51.000* :  It's very shallow on what they...
*24:51.000- 24:52.480* :  And I'm sure that a lot of the people
*24:53.080- 24:55.680* :  that accuses of that haven't been to Saudi or haven't seen
*24:56.100- 24:57.120* :  what we're doing on the ground.
*24:57.180- 24:58.620* :  Human rights campaigners will say,
*24:58.620- 25:03.540* :  well, look at the imprisoning of campaigners, women's rights.
*25:04.140- 25:05.700* :  No one's perfect, and we acknowledge that.
*25:05.700- 25:09.260* :  And we are reforming, and these events help us reform.
*25:09.980- 25:13.700* :  Saudi Arabia's sports minister there speaking to Dan Rowan.
*25:14.540- 25:15.660* :  Now, let's stay in that part of the world
*25:15.660- 25:18.300* :  because we're reporting on the annual climate change conference
*25:18.360- 25:19.260* :  a lot at the moment.
*25:19.260- 25:20.380* :  It's happening in Dubai.
*25:21.000- 25:22.580* :  And it's just about to head into its second
*25:22.580- 25:24.300* :  and usually crucial week.
*25:24.840- 25:27.020* :  The man in charge is Sultan Al Jaba,
*25:27.060- 25:29.260* :  who also happens to be the head of Abu Dhabi's
*25:29.260- 25:30.440* :  national oil company.
*25:30.940- 25:34.640* :  He's urged leaders and governments at the talks to step up,
*25:35.100- 25:36.620* :  telling them they could deliver what he called
*25:36.620- 25:38.820* :  a paradigm shift in the next few days.
*25:39.640- 25:41.620* :  Despite the warnings of record global warming,
*25:41.620- 25:44.800* :  rises in sea levels and growing extreme weather,
*25:45.300- 25:47.060* :  our correspondent Matt McGraw, who's in Dubai,
*25:47.440- 25:49.500* :  reports that many climate change experts
*25:49.500- 25:51.620* :  believe there is actually much to be hopeful about.
*25:56.080- 25:58.060* :  Electricity made from solar is not only
*25:58.060- 25:59.620* :  the world's cheapest form of energy,
*25:59.620- 26:02.580* :  it's probably the cheapest electricity in history.
*26:03.960- 26:06.920* :  Solar panels are going up all over the world at astonishing speed.
*26:07.560- 26:11.200* :  In China, across 2023, they're on track to add more solar
*26:11.580- 26:13.680* :  than the United States has ever installed.
*26:14.460- 26:16.060* :  Even in cold, gray Britain,
*26:16.600- 26:18.940* :  there's a secret solar revolution going on.
*26:19.480- 26:22.540* :  Some 17,000 homes a month are installing panels.
*26:22.980- 26:23.820* :  You could do with those.
*26:23.820- 26:25.680* :  There's a flat on the ground and tie them.
*26:26.160- 26:28.220* :  And then when the wind stops, we can put them back up.
*26:28.560- 26:30.940* :  Hillary Powell has been the driving force behind a push
*26:30.940- 26:34.000* :  for local solar on her street in East London.
*26:34.460- 26:37.000* :  Not only are the panels cutting energy bills, she says,
*26:37.660- 26:39.740* :  they're allowing people to take practical steps
*26:40.320- 26:41.680* :  in the fight against climate change.
*26:41.880- 26:43.840* :  It's not just about renewable energy,
*26:43.840- 26:45.640* :  but it's about people power.
*26:45.820- 26:48.060* :  All of us realize that together we can take action
*26:48.380- 26:51.400* :  and do something practical to counter
*26:51.440- 26:54.280* :  the kind of effects of climate breakdown
*26:54.280- 26:56.100* :  and the economic crisis.
*26:56.400- 26:58.680* :  China is also a major force behind the advent
*26:58.680- 27:01.080* :  of electric vehicles, which is another reason
*27:01.080- 27:02.800* :  to be hopeful about climate change.
*27:03.500- 27:06.160* :  Not only can EVs cut emissions from transport,
*27:06.740- 27:09.060* :  they also have the potential to put cash in your pocket.
*27:09.680- 27:11.540* :  A technology called vehicle to grid
*27:11.540- 27:14.900* :  means these batteries on wheels can power your house
*27:15.320- 27:17.220* :  and send energy to the national grid.
*27:18.200- 27:19.980* :  Topping up when electricity is cheap
*27:20.480- 27:22.520* :  means you can turn a profit by selling it back
*27:22.520- 27:25.900* :  to the energy system when demand and prices are high.
*27:26.420- 27:31.140* :  What is happening to our world?
*27:33.020- 27:36.500* :  Have you ever stopped no tears?
*27:37.000- 27:38.460* :  The Pacific Island of Vanuatu
*27:38.860- 27:40.560* :  is taking a lawsuit on climate change
*27:40.560- 27:42.380* :  to the international court of justice.
*27:43.000- 27:45.160* :  And they're using all options, including song,
*27:45.680- 27:46.460* :  to make their case.
*27:46.460- 27:48.980* :  It has to be wrong.
*27:51.420- 27:53.760* :  In the next year or so, court rulings such as this one
*27:54.140- 27:55.820* :  will give greater clarity as to who's
*27:55.820- 27:57.480* :  responsible for climate damage.
*27:58.000- 28:00.640* :  Jeffrey Simon is one of America's top litigators,
*28:01.060- 28:04.040* :  currently taking a $52 billion damages case
*28:04.560- 28:06.680* :  against a range of oil and gas companies.
*28:07.520- 28:10.300* :  He says the courts are a real reason for hope
*28:10.300- 28:11.840* :  when it comes to global warming.
*28:11.840- 28:17.040* :  People who deny climate change, as a result of carbon pollution
*28:17.040- 28:20.100* :  largely from the burning of fossil fuels,
*28:20.760- 28:23.760* :  are either gas-lighting you, pun intended,
*28:24.220- 28:28.640* :  or they are simply misinformed, because the science is
*28:28.880- 28:29.140* :  overwhelmed.
*28:33.860- 28:36.040* :  As political leaders and their negotiating teams
*28:36.040- 28:39.380* :  meet here at Cup 28, one important reason for optimism
*28:39.380- 28:40.260* :  is history.
*28:41.200- 28:43.380* :  Just eight years ago, when the Paris climate agreement
*28:43.380- 28:45.420* :  was signed, the remarkable document
*28:45.420- 28:48.160* :  didn't contain any mention of coal, oil, or gas,
*28:48.740- 28:50.600* :  the main drivers of climate change.
*28:53.440- 28:55.640* :  Here in Dubai, among the ceremonial drummers,
*28:56.000- 28:57.420* :  there's a real hope that the parties
*28:57.420- 29:00.020* :  will agree to finally end the use of these fuels
*29:00.580- 29:02.200* :  in some shape or form this century.
*29:02.880- 29:05.740* :  That would consign to history the root cause of global warming
*29:06.240- 29:07.940* :  and give the world a fighting chance
*29:08.520- 29:10.700* :  of defeating our biggest collective threat.
*29:12.240- 29:13.740* :  Matt McGraw reporting from Dubai.
*29:14.240- 29:16.080* :  Let's send this podcast on the birds and the bees,
*29:16.140- 29:18.180* :  actual birds and bees.
*29:18.840- 29:21.460* :  Since ancient times, honey hunters in parts of Africa
*29:21.460- 29:24.220* :  have relied on wild birds to help them find honey.
*29:24.860- 29:27.840* :  So have a listen to this, some very different calls
*29:27.840- 29:28.860* :  used by people.
*29:29.120- 29:31.360* :  First of all, in Tanzania, they're Mozambique.
*29:38.340- 29:41.580* :  RUNNING
*29:54.120- 29:54.920* :  RUNNING
*29:59.460- 29:59.480* :  RUNNING
*29:59.480- 29:59.740* :  So, what does all that mean?
*30:00.140- 30:03.180* :  Well, researchers here in the UK at the University of Cambridge
*30:03.180- 30:06.260* :  have discovered that the birds recognize familiar calls
*30:06.780- 30:09.160* :  far more likely to help people from their own area.
*30:09.720- 30:11.780* :  One of those researchers is Claire Spotty's words,
*30:11.780- 30:13.180* :  she's in Mozambique at the moment,
*30:13.240- 30:15.740* :  and she's been speaking on a slightly wobbly line
*30:16.040- 30:17.180* :  to my colleague, Martha Cunning.
*30:17.600- 30:19.100* :  The great honey guy who you heard
*30:19.100- 30:21.100* :  giving those chattering calls and those recordings
*30:21.100- 30:23.840* :  is a species of African bird that loves to eat beeswax,
*30:23.860- 30:25.080* :  which is very rich in energy.
*30:25.660- 30:27.820* :  But this is only possible if you're first able to come
*30:27.820- 30:30.640* :  the thousands of stinging honey bees that defend their nest.
*30:30.660- 30:33.740* :  So honey guides are very good at knowing where bees nest are,
*30:34.180- 30:35.720* :  whereas human honey hunters aren't quite as good
*30:35.900- 30:36.520* :  as they find in business.
*30:36.620- 30:38.440* :  But they have the skills to use violence,
*30:38.440- 30:40.980* :  to stew the stinging bees and open their nest.
*30:41.420- 30:41.960* :  So how guides are?
*30:42.340- 30:44.220* :  Seek us out as humans, they come to us
*30:44.260- 30:45.200* :  and they attract our attention
*30:45.660- 30:47.520* :  with those specialised chattering calls
*30:47.540- 30:49.160* :  that you heard and guide us from tree to tree
*30:49.160- 30:52.620* :  to show us a business and wait for us to harvest our skills.
*30:52.620- 30:55.440* :  It is a wonderful story of collaboration.
*30:55.960- 30:57.840* :  But then your researchers has discovered
*30:58.400- 31:01.060* :  how discriminating the birds can be,
*31:01.480- 31:04.460* :  and they know the difference between their local honey hunters
*31:05.020- 31:06.820* :  and calls from outside their area.
*31:07.360- 31:10.040* :  Human honey hunters signal to honey guides
*31:10.040- 31:12.160* :  using those specialised calls.
*31:12.160- 31:14.420* :  And these vary among cultures from whistle melody
*31:14.980- 31:16.120* :  to a trill and a grunt,
*31:16.120- 31:18.240* :  or in some cases, whoops and whistles,
*31:18.300- 31:21.440* :  so the female human cultural variation across Africa
*31:21.860- 31:23.420* :  that honey guides need to contend with.
*31:23.740- 31:28.160* :  And when the birds helped human beings to find the honey,
*31:28.160- 31:29.280* :  what happens then?
*31:29.280- 31:32.080* :  Just as painters, how the honey's extracted?
*31:32.580- 31:35.920* :  Yes, so once the bird and human reach their joined quarry together,
*31:35.920- 31:38.200* :  which is the business, the bird tends to fall quiet
*31:38.220- 31:39.960* :  and just give a few small high-pitched noises.
*31:39.960- 31:42.160* :  And that's a signal to the human that they've arrived.
*31:42.640- 31:45.440* :  And at that point, the humans will often tap the trees
*31:45.440- 31:48.020* :  with axes to see where bees are emerging.
*31:48.060- 31:50.280* :  And that tells them that they found the nest
*31:50.280- 31:51.880* :  and they can then light a fire
*31:51.880- 31:53.640* :  and add plenty of green leaves to add smoke
*31:54.100- 31:55.700* :  and harvest the nest using their axes
*31:55.700- 31:56.540* :  all through this time.
*31:56.540- 31:57.640* :  The bird just waits quietly,
*31:58.060- 31:59.600* :  waiting through its own reward,
*31:59.600- 32:02.400* :  which is the empty wax cones that are left behind
*32:02.400- 32:04.800* :  once the humans have left with what they want,
*32:04.800- 32:06.740* :  which is a large bucket of honey.
*32:07.260- 32:09.580* :  Claire Spotiswood speaking from Mozambique
*32:09.640- 32:11.400* :  with the birds, the bees, and the honey.
*32:14.160- 32:15.100* :  Well, that's all from us for now,
*32:15.100- 32:17.980* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
