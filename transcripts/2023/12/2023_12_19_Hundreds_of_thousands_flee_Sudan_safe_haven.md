*01:45.480- 01:49.420* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday,
*01:49.420- 01:55.420* :  the 19th of December, a quarter of a million people flee a new battle in Sudan as the rapid
*01:55.420- 02:01.020* :  support forces push back the army. Ahead of a vote at the UN aid agency's voice anger at the
*02:01.020- 02:07.020* :  humanitarian suffering in Gaza. And we hear about conditions for hostages held by Hamas
*02:07.020- 02:15.720* :  from a Thai worker who was recently released. Also in the podcast, Iceland witnesses a spectacular
*02:15.720- 02:21.680* :  volcanic eruption near the capital Reykjavik. And in the black market you have the pressure of
*02:21.680- 02:25.640* :  the police and the neighbours and in this environment you have the pressure to perform.
*02:26.400- 02:29.380* :  The cannabis growers in the Netherlands going legal.
*02:34.520- 02:40.040* :  In the eight months since war broke out between two rival armies in Sudan, at least 12,000
*02:40.040- 02:44.560* :  people have been killed and seven million have fled. Most of the fighting has been
*02:44.560- 02:49.640* :  centered around the capital, Khartoum and in the eastern region of Darfur. Many hundreds of
*02:49.640- 02:55.960* :  thousands of people sought refuge in a city south of Khartoum called Wad Madani. But that too
*02:55.960- 03:01.660* :  has now become caught up in the fighting. Has the paramilitary rapid support forces continue to
*03:01.660- 03:06.360* :  push back the regular army. Mandipo Brian is the UNICEF representative in Sudan.
*03:06.940- 03:14.140* :  These have been eight brutal months or four which continues to have a devastated impact on
*03:14.140- 03:22.600* :  children. And we've seen a dangerous escalation of violence since the last weekend with the spread
*03:22.600- 03:29.980* :  into Madani, that is the capital of the Jazeera state, to which we estimate almost half a million
*03:29.980- 03:37.100* :  people including children had fled from Khartoum and Darfur. Well over the past four days, at least
*03:37.100- 03:44.200* :  250,000 have fled El Jazeera state. Our Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton told me about
*03:44.200- 03:50.640* :  the battle for Wad Madani. There was a main army base there from the Sudanese armed forces
*03:51.340- 03:56.640* :  and it seems that that's been taken over. It's a sign that the RSF, the paramilitary,
*03:57.300- 04:03.700* :  is gaining more and more territory across Sudan and particularly they control already
*04:03.700- 04:10.400* :  four out of the five main cities in Darfur in the west and they seem to be moving towards the east.
*04:10.400- 04:17.840* :  They seem to have more or less taken control of Khartoum, the capital although that's still contested
*04:18.220- 04:24.720* :  and it looks as if the Sudanese army will just end up in port Sudan. So it's quite significant
*04:24.720- 04:31.580* :  and these areas south of the capital were on the main supply route for getting armaments from
*04:31.580- 04:37.900* :  the south and from the west and Darfur. So it's very strategic and Wad Madani has a bridge
*04:37.900- 04:44.100* :  over the blue Nile as well and as we were hearing from UNICEF it was a safe haven for refugees
*04:44.100- 04:49.700* :  and now it's not so there's really very few places where civilians can flee to.
*04:50.100- 04:56.700* :  And remind us about this force that's on the advance the rapid support forces and why they're
*04:56.700- 05:03.740* :  fighting the regular army. Yes so they were created by the former dictatorial authoritarian
*05:03.740- 05:09.560* :  leader Omar Al-Bashir in Sudan before he was overthrown and he created them as a way of
*05:09.560- 05:15.600* :  co-proofing his regime and they were a counterbalance to the regular army but once he was ousted
*05:15.600- 05:20.520* :  in a popular revolution and there were discussions about how to go towards a democratic government
*05:20.620- 05:26.920* :  then the two sides fell out with each other and it's basically just been a power struggle for them
*05:26.920- 05:33.420* :  and it's now sort of monster that's out of control it's the legacy of Omar Al-Bashir and they're
*05:33.420- 05:40.080* :  the reincarnation of the Jangerweed who caused genocide in Darfur 20 years ago and it looks as though
*05:40.540- 05:44.900* :  they're doing the same thing again they have very little respect for human rights and
*05:45.340- 05:52.560* :  there are allegations well-founded that the United Arab Emirates is funding them with military
*05:52.560- 05:58.400* :  equipment like drones and that's giving them the upper hand they've denied this but analysts
*05:58.400- 06:03.900* :  have looked at flights coming in from Chad and the UAE says that these are humanitarian
*06:04.140- 06:09.740* :  operations but not many analysts believe that. Briefly so from what you're saying sounds like
*06:09.740- 06:14.740* :  the army are on the back foot are they on the brink of defeat? Well that may be a little bit strong
*06:14.740- 06:20.780* :  but previously it looked as if this war was going nowhere and that it was a stalemate and that
*06:20.780- 06:26.360* :  no side would land the knockout blow so there were hopes that peace talks would result from this
*06:26.400- 06:34.280* :  stalemate but because the RSF definitely has military momentum in a way they have no reason to
*06:34.280- 06:39.740* :  agree to a ceasefire and the army has no leverage. Now Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton
*06:40.760- 06:45.820* :  aid agencies have voiced anger and frustration over the continued suffering of civilians in Gaza
*06:45.820- 06:51.260* :  as the UN Security Council debates whether to call for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.
*06:51.920- 06:56.280* :  A vote was due to take place on Monday but was delayed to allow time to try to prevent
*06:56.280- 07:01.160* :  a veto by Israel's ally the United States. Imaging folks reports from Geneva.
*07:01.680- 07:08.940* :  Aid workers can't hide their despair. A UNICEF spokesman said he was truly furious that Gaza's
*07:08.940- 07:15.840* :  children couldn't even find safety in hospitals. On Sunday a 13-year-old girl whose family died
*07:15.840- 07:22.900* :  in bombing some weeks ago and who had already had her leg amputated was reported killed when her
*07:22.900- 07:29.000* :  hospital ward was hit by a tank shell. The World Health Organization said it was beyond belief
*07:29.000- 07:34.780* :  that this should continue. The aid agencies the humanitarian wing of the United Nations
*07:34.860- 07:40.260* :  have said for weeks they cannot do their job without at least a pause in the fighting
*07:40.300- 07:47.100* :  but that decision lies with the UN's political wing and its all-powerful Security Council.
*07:47.720- 07:52.460* :  As with so many other conflicts like Syria it seems unable to agree.
*07:53.140- 07:59.520* :  Imaging folks meanwhile one of the Thai hostages abducted by Hamas from southern Israel on 7th
*07:59.520- 08:05.820* :  of October has spoken to the BBC about his time in captivity in Gaza. The 37-year-old farm worker
*08:05.820- 08:10.500* :  said he was fed just once a day, sometimes no more than a piece of bread and a dried date
*08:10.500- 08:16.840* :  and lived underground for 51 days. He was released last month and is now back in Thailand where he
*08:16.840- 08:21.540* :  spoke to our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head. He's one of the very large number of Thai
*08:21.540- 08:26.040* :  farm workers who go to Israel. They're absolutely essential to the Israeli agricultural economy.
*08:26.040- 08:31.220* :  It's a long tradition. He'd only just arrived. I mean it was his first trip to Israel. He'd only
*08:31.220- 08:37.380* :  arrived at the end of September and he'd just been moved on October the 6th to the Kaffir Azakabut
*08:37.380- 08:41.820* :  which some of your listeners may know is one of the very worst affected by the Hamas attack with
*08:41.820- 08:45.840* :  huge numbers of people killed there and in the morning when the attack started his fellow Thai
*08:45.840- 08:51.300* :  workers assured him the gunfire was normal and as they started to get more concerned or went inside
*08:51.960- 08:56.420* :  he's described how the Hamas government at that point burst into the room.
*08:58.220- 09:05.440* :  I crouched down like this and shouted Thailand Thailand Thailand by the kept beating me. All I
*09:05.440- 09:11.820* :  could do was keep my face down. Another guy trampled on me. I crawled under the bed to hide.
*09:11.820- 09:17.920* :  I was about to text my wife to say I was being taken but then they dragged me out by my leg.
*09:18.360- 09:24.380* :  One of the real problems this poor man experience was that he was the only tie in the group he
*09:24.380- 09:29.020* :  was held with and because he'd only just arrived in Israel he hadn't managed to pick up any other
*09:29.020- 09:34.820* :  language at all no English no Hebrew no Arabic and that made his ordeal which lasted for 51 days
*09:34.820- 09:40.420* :  entirely in tunnels underground under Gaza. He never saw daylight the whole time particularly
*09:40.420- 09:44.740* :  difficult because he couldn't understand his captors or even speak to his fellow hostages.
*09:47.820- 09:54.740* :  Two weeks I was like a madman there was no one to talk to to be honest I started talking to myself
*09:54.980- 10:01.580* :  I did a lot of thinking I wanted to ask questions but I couldn't communicate with anyone
*10:02.600- 10:09.280* :  the only way I got through this was by thinking of the faces of my children my wife and my mother
*10:10.160- 10:16.400* :  I was hungry all the time because we got only one meal a day I had to sip the water
*10:17.080- 10:23.760* :  they gave us one large bottle which had to last four to five days or one small bottle which had to
*10:23.760- 10:29.920* :  last two days and Jonathan a further tragedy because he he became close didn't he or as close as
*10:29.920- 10:35.880* :  he could do given the language barrier to three young Israeli men who were also in captivity and
*10:35.880- 10:41.260* :  are now dead exactly and this was a detail we only discovered as we started our interview with him
*10:41.480- 10:45.560* :  the news had just broken up the tragic deaths of these three young Israeli men mistakenly shot
*10:45.560- 10:50.680* :  dead by the Israeli defense forces as they finally escaped at the end of last week he recognized
*10:50.680- 10:56.700* :  their faces he was with them almost his entire captivity and used hand signals whatever he could
*10:56.700- 11:02.900* :  to try to get some personal details he knew that Yottah was a drummer that Sammy I think was the
*11:02.900- 11:07.820* :  better one Arab among them loved his motorbike he picked up the farm chickens and he he described
*11:07.820- 11:12.100* :  how every morning they would make a point of shaking hands they would clap them on the shoulders
*11:12.720- 11:18.040* :  and so he is able even they couldn't find up much about them to give a sense of what their
*11:18.040- 11:22.820* :  captivity was like because of the experience exactly the same thing as him real shortages of
*11:22.820- 11:28.080* :  food one meal a day occasionally very rough treatment and this absolutely terrifying underground
*11:28.080- 11:32.680* :  ordeal they never knew when it would end Jonathan heard in Thailand talking to Justin Webb
*11:33.580- 11:39.580* :  in many countries in western Europe the US and East Asia more and more people either can't or
*11:39.580- 11:46.000* :  don't want to have children a new study of over two million people in Scandinavia has found that
*11:46.000- 11:51.340* :  many of these people may have suffered from a physical or mental illness in childhood Victoria
*11:51.340- 11:56.600* :  one kundas spoke to one of the authors of the study Melinda Mills from Oxford University what we
*11:56.600- 12:02.720* :  found was mental health behavioral disorders so things related to personality and mood or schizophrenia
*12:02.720- 12:08.740* :  and particularly for men it was actually an increase in alcohol and an alcohol intoxication
*12:09.160- 12:14.380* :  and for women it was related to metabolic disorders so think if you're diagnosed with obesity
*12:14.380- 12:20.080* :  as a child or type one or type two diabetes so these were really you know things we haven't
*12:20.080- 12:25.660* :  thought about before we identified rare diseases because you can do that in such a large population
*12:25.660- 12:31.960* :  as well what does that mean for our future the workforce going forward if we are getting less and
*12:31.960- 12:39.140* :  less children well it's an interesting question because in many countries across the world we're
*12:39.140- 12:44.680* :  experiencing drops in the total fertility rate or the total number of children so this is really
*12:44.680- 12:50.460* :  changing many things it it changes things in terms of care so if we have this increased number
*12:50.460- 12:56.580* :  of childless individuals then the state or the country or other individuals in their network
*12:56.580- 13:01.760* :  have to take care of them but as you said you know in the workforce if we have an increasing aging
*13:01.760- 13:09.120* :  population as we do in Western Europe and in some in East Asia you have to think about social care
*13:09.640- 13:15.020* :  institutional care and pension systems so it has really in transport I mean it has really far
*13:15.020- 13:21.000* :  reaching implications for societies just to be clear we are not talking about fertility issues
*13:21.000- 13:27.440* :  has been in the past so how it's talked about as a reason people do not have children but this
*13:27.440- 13:33.160* :  childlessness that we are now looking offers us a broader discussion would you say yes definitely
*13:33.160- 13:38.860* :  so if you're having up to one third of people not having children it can't just be a infertility
*13:38.860- 13:44.460* :  or a medical factor there has to be other things going on so studies have isolated that about
*13:44.460- 13:51.920* :  5% of that group so if it's 15 or 20% 5% of that are child-free so they're voluntarily saying I
*13:51.920- 13:56.720* :  don't want to have children but then there's this really large group so the WHO has said one in
*13:56.720- 14:02.580* :  six couples are having infertility issues so that's why we decided to look at diseases and we found
*14:02.580- 14:08.220* :  some really novel things that haven't been found in relation to childhood diseases so if you had
*14:08.220- 14:14.080* :  pneumonia or myocarditis or some arthritis as a child and you know we just didn't know that
*14:14.080- 14:18.740* :  before and the question is is that the disease or is that the medication that was used to be treated
*14:18.740- 14:24.480* :  for the disease or were some people in in relation to type 1 diabetes where some women told
*14:24.480- 14:29.120* :  you know you shouldn't be having children so there's all of these new factors that this study
*14:29.120- 14:34.120* :  opened up when looking at such a large population you know these early childhood diseases the
*14:34.120- 14:39.780* :  medication or the behavior around them you know it opens up new areas for research Melinda Mills
*14:43.100- 14:49.080* :  and still to come on the global news podcast no sledge the couple who traveled from the north to

*15:13.840- 15:19.580* :  into a web of drugs, money laundering and state-sponsored assassinations that stretches from Dublin
*15:19.580- 15:26.040* :  to Dubai. At the centre is a cocaine super cartel and a hidden economic war between democracies
*15:26.040- 15:31.020* :  and dictatorships. It's the new season of the hit podcast from the financial times and pushkin

*16:15.680- 16:21.360* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts. The US chemicals giant Monsanto has been ordered to pay
*16:21.360- 16:27.760* :  $857 million to a group of people who said they were exposed to chemicals leaking from the light
*16:27.760- 16:33.080* :  fittings at an American school. The claimants in Washington states said the discharge affected
*16:33.080- 16:38.080* :  their nervous systems and hormones. I heard more from our business correspondent Theo Leggett.
*16:38.240- 16:41.920* :  The company that's actually going to have to pay the money here is buyer which took control
*16:41.920- 16:50.440* :  of Monsanto in 2018 and it's affairs and now under the buyer brand. But what happened here was that
*16:50.860- 16:57.400* :  between 2005 and 2016 students at a school called the Sky Valley Education Centre in Monroe
*16:57.400- 17:02.520* :  in Washington states that was quite near Seattle found that they were becoming ill. They had a lot
*17:02.520- 17:06.900* :  of different ailments some of them neurological some of them affecting the endocrine system
*17:07.580- 17:13.720* :  and they ultimately decided that this was caused by PCBs a type of chemicals that used to be
*17:13.720- 17:19.700* :  used widely in industry. They were used for products such as cool king paint carbon copy paper
*17:20.000- 17:25.380* :  in electrical systems and these chemicals polychlorinated by phenols they were found around the
*17:25.380- 17:32.260* :  school so the case was that these chemicals had been making them ill and in this case the jury
*17:32.260- 17:38.280* :  has now decided to award very significant damages $73 million and a bit more than that actually
*17:38.280- 17:45.180* :  in this case compensatory damages and deterrent damages totaling $857 million and this is the latest
*17:45.180- 17:51.940* :  in a series of cases involving students at the school all told it's costing by some one and
*17:51.940- 17:58.520* :  a three quarter billion dollars if these damages stand. Yeah if so will buyer appeal against this?
*17:58.940- 18:03.360* :  Almost certainly I mean we've seen it in many many times in American court cases that when punitive
*18:03.360- 18:09.260* :  damages are awarded often those damages are watered down on appeal so it seems pretty inevitable
*18:09.420- 18:14.440* :  that will happen and the firm has said it plans to have the verdict reduced or overturned it says
*18:14.440- 18:20.260* :  the outcome has been constitutionally excessive as it describes it also we should state that
*18:20.300- 18:26.620* :  on behalf of Monsanto buyers said stop producing PCBs in 1977 they were actually banned by the
*18:26.620- 18:33.000* :  US government in 1979 and it says it had warned the school repeatedly since the 1990s that
*18:33.340- 18:38.060* :  light fittings which were containing these PCBs needed to be retrofitted but it says those warnings
*18:38.060- 18:43.060* :  were ignored. Our business correspondent Theo Leggett as you may have seen from the spectacular
*18:43.060- 18:49.320* :  pictures online a volcano has finally erupted in Iceland after weeks of seismic activity.
*18:49.940- 18:54.520* :  The latest reports say the lava appears to be flowing away from the only town in the area
*18:54.520- 18:59.980* :  Grindavik which was evacuated last month and Vera was one of those forced to leave the town
*18:59.980- 19:06.240* :  southwest of the capital Reykjavik. As the eruption is now on the north side of this 15 kilometer
*19:06.240- 19:12.800* :  long ridge that happened over a month ago although it's just erupting in the north part of it
*19:13.100- 19:17.240* :  they probably think there's a chance that it opens up somewhere else and then it's going to be
*19:17.240- 19:24.140* :  closer to Grindavik so I don't see that in the near future they will let people get close to Grindavik
*19:24.560- 19:31.700* :  so we are back in the waiting game. Mike Burton is a professor of volcanology at the University of
*19:31.700- 19:36.740* :  Manchester. Lucy Hawking's asked him why the volcano had erupted now. There's continuous
*19:36.740- 19:44.020* :  magma supply under Iceland and then there's sporadic eruptions and so some volcanic activities
*19:44.020- 19:51.520* :  is inevitable. The question is exactly where, when and in what form and we've had a series of
*19:51.520- 19:56.140* :  eruptions in the last few years from the Reykjavik peninsula which is the southwest of Iceland
*19:57.000- 20:03.860* :  and this is the latest manifestation and there was a lot of precursory signals before this eruption
*20:04.480- 20:09.600* :  that was obviously ready to go for some period of time. I mean one of the really interesting questions
*20:09.600- 20:14.800* :  from the volcanologist perspective is what is the final trigger that makes it actually go but
*20:15.120- 20:19.760* :  if I'm honest I think we still don't quite understand what it is which makes it transition
*20:19.760- 20:24.920* :  into the full eruption. Mike the pictures are very dramatic as we see the lava go up into the air
*20:24.920- 20:30.220* :  presumably then it flows down the volcano. Are you able to predict the route it will take or where
*20:30.220- 20:37.100* :  it could go? Well yes I think there's some very good models now to forecast the propagation of
*20:37.100- 20:43.780* :  the lava flows. Once the location of it is known and obviously the relief in a way of having
*20:43.780- 20:48.660* :  the eruption begin is that we now know exactly where it is and where it's going. I mean the good
*20:48.660- 20:53.660* :  news is that for the time being it seems the lava flows are not going towards the evacuated
*20:53.660- 20:59.300* :  populated areas and there was also some concerns about the a local power station which was
*20:59.580- 21:05.180* :  key for infrastructure around that part of the island so for the time being it looks like the
*21:05.180- 21:10.500* :  lava flows are going in a benign direction but they have to keep continuous vigilance because
*21:11.060- 21:16.320* :  the lava flow could evolve the fracture could evolve and so we'll have to see how this plays out
*21:16.320- 21:20.360* :  in the coming weeks and when you talk about the evolution and in fact you just said weeks and
*21:20.360- 21:25.040* :  months there we obviously don't know how long it will go on for and it could be months. What
*21:25.040- 21:30.720* :  stops something like this? Well I think it stops basically when the reservoir of magma which is
*21:30.720- 21:37.040* :  driving the eruption loses pressure and when there's basically you lose maybe 5% to 10% of the volume
*21:37.040- 21:43.140* :  of magma which is being accumulating at depth one that falls below a certain critical threshold
*21:43.140- 21:47.540* :  there isn't enough over pressure to generate the eruption and so then it just gradually
*21:47.540- 21:53.840* :  dwindles away and in fact what we can use is measurements of the amount of lava being erupted
*21:54.200- 21:59.140* :  how that evolves in time usually there's an exponential decay curve which allows us to forecast
*21:59.140- 22:04.260* :  when the end of the eruption may occur and so it's too early to say yet based on this eruption
*22:04.280- 22:09.660* :  it does seem that from I it looks like the intensity of the eruption is a bit less than it was when
*22:09.660- 22:14.360* :  it opened up yesterday evening which is good news and it's interesting as well because you can see
*22:14.360- 22:19.860* :  the morphology changing as the eruption continues there's ramparts that build up around the
*22:19.860- 22:25.000* :  fissure and the activity tends to get more focused but based on the effusion rates which have
*22:25.000- 22:30.300* :  been reported which are about 100 meters cubed to seconds this is about 10 times as much as was
*22:30.720- 22:38.280* :  happening in the previous eruptions in 2021 to 23 but about half or less than half of that which
*22:38.280- 22:44.820* :  erupted in 2014 2015 so those eruptions lasted several months so it's not unreasonable to
*22:44.820- 22:49.540* :  imagine this will last several months too. Professor of Volcanology Mike Burton from the University
*22:49.540- 22:55.000* :  of Manchester coffee shops in the Netherlands may be famous for allowing people to smoke cannabis
*22:55.580- 23:01.080* :  but using and supplying the drug has long been illegal the consumption of small quantities has
*23:01.080- 23:06.740* :  been covered by a police tolerance policy since the 1970s but it doesn't officially apply to
*23:06.740- 23:12.800* :  the growth and supply of cannabis which is dominated by criminal gangs but this week for the first
*23:12.800- 23:18.500* :  time cannabis is being cultivated legally as part of an experimental scheme that could eventually be
*23:18.500- 23:22.360* :  rolled out across the Netherlands there's our correspondent Anna Holligan reports.
*23:24.500- 23:31.480* :  Inside a large greenhouse the distinctive leafy marijuana plants are flourishing along with
*23:31.480- 23:38.480* :  the cannabis crew entrepreneur Bart Vollenberg he's smiling. Yeah of course if you 24 years waiting
*23:38.480- 23:43.160* :  on this moment and finally you are legally with plants and never been in this situation of course
*23:43.160- 23:48.660* :  you're very happy that you're able to just be there the biggest challenge to get here was regulation
*23:48.880- 23:54.480* :  all the paperwork that we have to fill in to get a bank account to get all the rules back from
*23:54.480- 24:05.260* :  illegality to legality we're now approaching the drying and production room there are five people
*24:05.260- 24:11.720* :  wearing white protective suits and turquoise rubber gloves and what we're doing here is we're
*24:11.720- 24:20.120* :  weighing all the the the portions of one three and five grams and then when it's packed it's ready
*24:21.180- 24:28.040* :  that's Case Sheffelhout an organic weed expert he calls himself a cannabis connoisseur he's
*24:28.080- 24:32.920* :  well known in the industry and film this one is properly tracked and traced so we can like actually
*24:33.640- 24:46.140* :  put this into the little search hundreds of freshly harvested cannabis buds are tumbling into
*24:46.140- 24:54.560* :  a plastic tub we work together with laboratories to analyze our soil our flowers and our environment so
*24:54.560- 24:59.460* :  these of course are three major points that in the black market is not happening and because we are
*24:59.460- 25:06.560* :  doing this we can ensure a high quality product without residue pesticides or chemicals we have
*25:06.560- 25:11.720* :  lots of experience I think with all the people walking around here we have more than 100 years of
*25:12.780- 25:19.100* :  experience this experiment means the job case previously kept undercover is no longer illegal
*25:19.540- 25:24.700* :  so the big change indeed like in the black market you have the pressure of the police and the
*25:24.700- 25:33.200* :  neighbors and in this environment you have the pressure to perform the cannabis is sorted by weight
*25:33.200- 25:40.520* :  into glass jars to keep it visible and free of contamination and then we end up here
*25:40.680- 25:48.240* :  barge voluntary so this is the consumer packaging you see the flower in there and on the other side
*25:48.240- 25:52.780* :  is a lot of information and a lot of rules and regulation from the government and then there's
*25:52.780- 25:58.520* :  a trek in trace so there's a system the government can see where it's coming from and there's also
*25:59.080- 26:05.460* :  consumer information way too long no I'm shaking my head because it's like wow it's like on full
*26:05.460- 26:13.140* :  circle from a completely like a paint industry to like following every tiny step it's
*26:14.240- 26:21.000* :  mind blowing in the end it's all about trust can we trust the existing industry to take care
*26:21.880- 26:30.060* :  of cannabis production and distribution and do it in a transparent and fair and honest way that's it
*26:30.420- 26:37.780* :  and this was the moment Europe's first ever legal batch of commercially cultivated cannabis
*26:37.780- 26:43.760* :  was delivered to a coffee shop and symbolically unsealed by the Dutch health minister
*26:44.200- 26:50.340* :  independent researchers and I'm monitoring this historic trial with a view to eventual decriminalisation
*26:52.060- 26:57.680* :  and a hologram in the Netherlands now anyone who has an electric car will be familiar with what's
*26:57.680- 27:02.620* :  known as range anxiety the fear that your battery will run out before you get to the next charging
*27:02.620- 27:08.340* :  point but spare a thought for Chris and Julie Ramsey from the Scottish city of Aberdeen they've
*27:08.340- 27:13.740* :  managed to drive their rather special electric car all the way from the north pole to the south pole
*27:13.740- 27:22.140* :  then Philip has the story a moment years in the planning a first of its kind adventure driving
*27:22.140- 27:29.100* :  pole to pole in an electric car it's such a relief to finish this exhibition six years in the
*27:29.100- 27:34.340* :  planning six years in the making and we're finally here it's a bit surreal to be in Antarctica and
*27:34.340- 27:38.340* :  you've been at the south pole right it's exactly that I mean what we've known the road ten months
*27:38.340- 27:43.900* :  and as Chris says huge sense of relief we can't believe we've made history and it's just
*27:43.900- 27:51.100* :  absolutely amazing Chris and Julie's expedition started in March on Arctic sea ice the 18,000 mile
*27:51.100- 27:57.320* :  journey took them through 17 countries from north to South America their car powered by charging
*27:57.320- 28:03.100* :  points along the way or portable solar panels and our mission is to show how exciting and capable
*28:03.100- 28:07.700* :  electric vehicles are and to debunk all those myths out there that currently surrounding
*28:07.700- 28:11.960* :  electric vehicles can they work in the cold can the batteries work in the cold can they drive in
*28:11.960- 28:18.040* :  the snow so many so many questions modifications to the car were kept to a minimum but bigger tires
*28:18.040- 28:23.280* :  were added to help cope with harsh terrain Chris and Julie are looking forward to our rest over
*28:23.280- 28:28.980* :  Christmas so you haven't ruled out more adventures in the future Ben Philip reporting
*28:31.320- 28:35.260* :  and that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon this
*28:35.260- 28:40.040* :  edition was mixed by Joe McCartney and produced by Judy Franco our editors Karen Martin I'm all
*28:40.040- 28:41.880* :  of a con way until next time goodbye
