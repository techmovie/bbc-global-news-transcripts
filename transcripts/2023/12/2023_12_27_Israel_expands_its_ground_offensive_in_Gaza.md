*00:19.460- 00:22.980* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:25.620- 00:29.300* :  I'm Alex Richardson, and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday,
*00:29.300- 00:32.820* :  the 27th of December, these are our main stories.
*00:32.820- 00:38.820* :  Israel says its airstrikes of hit tunnels containing the Hamas headquarters in Jabali at Northern Gaza.
*00:39.180- 00:41.300* :  We can't accept Hamas's terms.
*00:41.300- 00:43.060* :  We can't accept their rules of the game.
*00:43.060- 00:47.840* :  Letting Hamas survive is just a recipe for more violence down the road.
*00:48.160- 00:51.920* :  And the pull of the war in Ukraine reaches to Nepal's Himalayan valleys.
*00:51.920- 00:57.200* :  People are said to be charging up to $9,000 to recruit these young Nepali men
*00:57.200- 01:00.260* :  so that they go via India or through the Middle East or Asia
*01:00.260- 01:02.860* :  and fight as mercenaries for the Russian army.
*01:05.200- 01:11.580* :  Also, in this podcast, dozens of barnacle encrusted packages of cocaine wash up on beaches in Australia
*01:12.180- 01:15.980* :  and the impact of book bans on school children across the US.
*01:16.260- 01:18.820* :  When you ban these books, because of that reason, they look at that
*01:18.820- 01:23.540* :  and they say, am I being banned? Am I not appropriate for people to read?
*01:27.800- 01:31.640* :  The Israeli military is keeping up its offensive across the Gaza Strip,
*01:31.640- 01:35.220* :  shifting most of its focus now to southern and central areas.
*01:35.680- 01:40.780* :  It claims to have carried out strikes on at least 200 Hamas targets in the past 24 hours.
*01:41.280- 01:43.920* :  Israel admits the war could last many more months.
*01:44.380- 01:47.940* :  Mark Reggev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*01:48.320- 01:51.740* :  says the fighting has to persist until Hamas is eliminated.
*01:52.220- 01:55.640* :  We can't destroy Hamas' ideology, unfortunately, that's not realistic.
*01:56.120- 02:01.260* :  But we can remove them from power. We can prevent them from having control over this territorial enclave.
*02:01.600- 02:05.260* :  And that will do a lot to save lives and prevent future conflict in the region.
*02:05.500- 02:08.620* :  And they know the only way to save themselves in their regime of terror
*02:09.140- 02:12.820* :  is to have pressure for a ceasefire. But everyone, if one talks about moral leadership,
*02:13.400- 02:17.300* :  we can't accept Hamas' terms. We can't accept their rules of the game.
*02:17.700- 02:22.280* :  Letting Hamas survive is just a recipe for more violence down the road.
*02:22.620- 02:25.420* :  Meanwhile, the suffering of ordinary Palestinians continues.
*02:25.420- 02:31.100* :  The Hamas-run health ministry says almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza
*02:31.560- 02:32.440* :  over the past two days.
*02:32.440- 02:36.900* :  The Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Muhammad Shataya,
*02:37.280- 02:40.060* :  described Israel as a criminal outlawed state.
*02:40.060- 02:44.440* :  He said he was asking the International Criminal Court to start legal action
*02:44.440- 02:49.460* :  against those he said were responsible for committing crimes against the Palestinian people.
*02:49.460- 02:55.280* :  Juliet Tumur is from the UN's main relief agency for Palestinians, Unra.
*02:55.740- 03:00.460* :  She says the lack of humanitarian aid reaching the people of Gaza remains a huge problem.
*03:00.820- 03:04.480* :  Very little supplies continue to come into the Gaza Strip
*03:05.040- 03:07.140* :  and there needs to be more aid.
*03:07.140- 03:10.540* :  And I can speak to the aid that Unra receives.
*03:10.540- 03:16.260* :  We do know that it's very, very little and it doesn't correspond to the ongoing
*03:16.260- 03:19.220* :  and increasing humanitarian needs on the ground in Gaza.
*03:19.720- 03:25.380* :  Gaza used to get every single day 500 trucks of humanitarian aid or fuel
*03:26.160- 03:30.160* :  and of commercial supplies in no day during this war.
*03:30.160- 03:33.200* :  Have we reached anything close to that?
*03:33.240- 03:39.020* :  On average, we're still receiving around 100 on a good day
*03:39.460- 03:46.340* :  and so much more needs to happen and be done to get to the levels of pre-war.
*03:46.940- 03:52.120* :  I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda Nell, about the current situation in Gaza.
*03:52.720- 03:57.480* :  The reports we're hearing Israel is continuing to bomb parts of the north of the Gaza Strip
*03:57.480- 03:59.960* :  where it has said it has operational control.
*03:59.960- 04:03.660* :  All we heard that one of its latest strikes in Jabalya was targeting
*04:03.660- 04:07.160* :  an underground tunnel headquarters belonging to Hamas.
*04:07.640- 04:12.380* :  But really, its intense ground offensive continues, particularly in Hain Unas
*04:12.440- 04:13.660* :  in the very south of the Strip.
*04:13.660- 04:19.080* :  And now it's expanded into another part of the territory in the middle of the Gaza Strip
*04:19.100- 04:23.900* :  where residents have been told to evacuate, about the width of the centre of Gaza
*04:23.900- 04:27.020* :  people told to move to nearby Dear Abbalah.
*04:27.420- 04:32.500* :  And we've had the UN a senior official warning that this is something gravely concerning
*04:32.500- 04:36.760* :  because already we have so many displaced people in this area,
*04:37.120- 04:40.900* :  people who relocated from the north in particular in search of refuge.
*04:41.320- 04:42.700* :  And the situation in the West Bank?
*04:43.260- 04:48.960* :  And in the West Bank, we've had overnight an Israeli raid on an urban refugee camp
*04:48.960- 04:53.480* :  close to Tolcarim with six people killed according to Palestinian health officials.
*04:54.120- 04:58.160* :  They claim there was an Israeli drone strike, the Israeli military hasn't yet commented.
*04:58.740- 05:03.320* :  But really, it's an indication again of just how violence has flaired in the West Bank
*05:03.500- 05:05.700* :  since the 7th of October attacks on Israel.
*05:06.100- 05:09.920* :  More than 300 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers
*05:09.920- 05:12.900* :  according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health there.
*05:12.900- 05:17.640* :  And this comes after the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas gave his first interview
*05:17.640- 05:21.900* :  since the start of the war yesterday and did warn that the West Bank was
*05:21.900- 05:23.640* :  at risk of implosion, he said.
*05:24.020- 05:28.980* :  And the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under enormous pressure from the hostages' families.
*05:29.420- 05:33.320* :  That's right, there was another demonstration that took place last night.
*05:33.320- 05:37.280* :  You know, there's international pressure on Israel from its closest ally from the U.S.
*05:37.280- 05:41.040* :  to lower the intensity of operations in Gaza to reduce civilian deaths.
*05:41.480- 05:45.360* :  But at home, what is really chiming with the sympathies of the Israeli public
*05:45.360- 05:50.160* :  are these relatives of the 100-plus hostages still held in Gaza
*05:50.160- 05:54.220* :  with so little information really coming through about what's happened to them.
*05:54.520- 05:58.440* :  They have accused their government of not doing enough to bring their loved ones home.
*05:58.900- 06:04.380* :  And there has been talk, of course, of Egypt in particular trying to mediate another deal
*06:04.380- 06:08.120* :  to reach at least a humanitarian pause in Gaza.
*06:08.700- 06:12.860* :  But so far, those talks with Egypt mediating between Israel and Hamas
*06:13.200- 06:15.040* :  haven't come to any kind of conclusion.
*06:15.040- 06:18.240* :  The idea would be that there could be a halt in the fighting
*06:18.240- 06:21.840* :  that could bring more hostages out of Gaza and take more aid in.
*06:22.220- 06:23.020* :  You land now.
*06:23.980- 06:27.120* :  Ukraine says Russian forces have attacked a railway station
*06:27.120- 06:32.500* :  in the southern port city of Kherson, where civilians were waiting to board an evacuation train.
*06:33.020- 06:37.240* :  The Ukrainian Interior Minister said one person was killed and four others were wounded.
*06:37.600- 06:42.700* :  Kherson has been repeatedly targeted by Russian forces since Ukraine recaptured it late last year.
*06:43.160- 06:46.480* :  I got the latest from our correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse.
*06:47.000- 06:53.720* :  Shelling is a part of daily life for people who live in Kherson, really, since it was liberated last year.
*06:54.060- 06:56.880* :  I think the number of casualties appears quite low.
*06:57.640- 07:02.320* :  Thankfully against the large numbers of people who were reportedly gathering at the station,
*07:02.320- 07:05.200* :  police have been credited by the authorities for helping get people out.
*07:05.200- 07:09.600* :  But a police officer is rumoured to have lost their life in the attack.
*07:09.660- 07:12.600* :  Now, the authorities are saying it was an evacuation train.
*07:12.620- 07:18.640* :  It was a train route which was established almost immediately after Kherson was liberated
*07:18.660- 07:21.820* :  when Russian forces retreated across the Nepro River.
*07:22.540- 07:25.740* :  But what has followed is that the Russians re-established their positions
*07:25.740- 07:30.480* :  and they have launched artillery strikes on the city across residential areas
*07:30.500- 07:33.600* :  and suburbs close to the river on a daily basis.
*07:33.600- 07:38.300* :  When you go there, the level of threat that people live with is always quite surprising.
*07:38.580- 07:43.040* :  I tell you that living there now is still better than living under occupation.
*07:43.140- 07:46.640* :  That's the kind of broad sentiment among those who have stayed.
*07:46.640- 07:50.520* :  But there is a strain that comes with living close to the front line.
*07:51.280- 07:54.040* :  And this is a reminder of the very real risks that they live with.
*07:54.580- 07:58.160* :  Of course, this strike on the railway station comes after Ukraine
*07:58.160- 08:03.000* :  launched a successful attack on a Russian warship in the Black Sea.
*08:03.000- 08:06.560* :  Is there any suggestion that this could be retaliation?
*08:07.200- 08:10.420* :  No, and I don't think it'll ever be possible to make that link.
*08:10.500- 08:14.060* :  It is true that both sides have staged more spectacular attack,
*08:14.080- 08:18.300* :  shall we say, when the other has enjoyed success on the battlefield.
*08:18.300- 08:23.280* :  But if you look at the pattern of Russia's tactics in its continued invasion,
*08:23.380- 08:29.420* :  it launches artillery strikes, drone attacks on settlements right across the front line
*08:29.420- 08:30.920* :  as well as close to the Russian border.
*08:31.400- 08:36.820* :  It has always adopted this strategy of trying to suppress the local populations.
*08:37.520- 08:42.160* :  However, the attack on this major landing ship in Crimea
*08:42.160- 08:44.160* :  is a welcome bit of good news to Kiev.
*08:44.300- 08:47.480* :  The damage is undeniable. The explosion was colossal,
*08:47.540- 08:51.220* :  and it will no doubt hamper Russian operations to an extent.
*08:51.960- 08:54.060* :  But for Ukraine, it's very much playing the long game
*08:54.140- 08:57.340* :  and trying to undermine Russian control in the Crimea Peninsula
*08:57.340- 08:58.640* :  as well as the Black Sea.
*08:59.400- 09:02.120* :  For now, it changes very little on the front line,
*09:02.140- 09:05.280* :  where it is Russia making waves off the waves of attack
*09:05.280- 09:08.800* :  and most recently claiming to have captured the eastern city of Mardinka,
*09:09.040- 09:10.660* :  which Ukraine disputes.
*09:10.660- 09:14.480* :  But we are still talking about a city of which there is barely anything left,
*09:14.820- 09:16.320* :  like all other settlements on the front line.
*09:16.400- 09:17.740* :  It's been reduced to rubble.
*09:18.320- 09:19.520* :  James Waterhouse.
*09:20.700- 09:24.300* :  As the crow flies, it's just over 5,000 kilometers
*09:24.300- 09:26.900* :  from the flatlands of Kassons, Dnieper Valley,
*09:26.900- 09:30.280* :  to the Himalayan peaks of Nepal, and its capital, Kapanandu.
*09:30.400- 09:34.460* :  But today comes news that shows just how far the shockwaves of the war
*09:34.460- 09:38.480* :  in Ukraine have reverberated with reports that about a hundred young men
*09:38.480- 09:40.660* :  from Nepal, who'd signed up to fight for Russia,
*09:41.100- 09:42.860* :  are missing in action or wounded.
*09:43.480- 09:45.340* :  How they got there is a story in itself.
*09:45.720- 09:49.980* :  Our South Asia original editor and barassan Etirajan in Delhi told me more.
*09:50.720- 09:54.160* :  Many young Nepalese are looking for opportunities to go abroad,
*09:54.160- 09:58.980* :  either to work or even to study or on a visit as well.
*09:59.180- 10:01.180* :  Now, according to the Nepali officials,
*10:01.820- 10:04.020* :  many of these dozens of people went to Russia.
*10:04.340- 10:07.480* :  They volunteered themselves because they are giving some inducements
*10:07.500- 10:09.420* :  like money or residency permits.
*10:10.160- 10:14.880* :  So they have reportedly joined Russian army as mercenaries fighting in the front line.
*10:15.460- 10:19.220* :  And the Nepali foreign minister, N.P. South, says that these hundred people
*10:19.220- 10:22.760* :  are either missing or wounded and some of them are captured.
*10:22.920- 10:27.140* :  And so Nepal has raised this issue with the Russia saying that they should not be
*10:27.440- 10:31.720* :  recruiting Nepali citizens to fight because this is causing a lot of concern
*10:32.320- 10:34.580* :  for the families back at home as well.
*10:35.060- 10:39.480* :  But it is also part of the human trafficking ring because people are said to be
*10:39.480- 10:44.240* :  charging up to nine thousand dollars to recruit these young Nepali men
*10:44.240- 10:47.380* :  so that they go via India or through the Middle East or Russia
*10:47.920- 10:50.320* :  and fight as mercenaries for the Russian army.
*10:50.680- 10:54.660* :  So how much do we know of what has actually happened to these Nepali fighters?
*10:56.360- 10:59.500* :  When I met the Nepali foreign minister a couple of months ago in Kathmandu,
*10:59.500- 11:05.500* :  he was talking about dozens of people are worried about the loved ones who went there to fight.
*11:05.500- 11:10.260* :  And that time itself, he was saying about seven people reportedly killed
*11:10.260- 11:15.500* :  and their families had no information about the loved ones who went to fight in Ukraine.
*11:15.780- 11:17.780* :  Or went to Russia either to study.
*11:18.500- 11:23.360* :  And now it's a big concern for Nepal itself because they don't allow anyone to
*11:23.480- 11:28.480* :  go and fight for other countries except for Indian Britain because of the ancient treaties
*11:28.480- 11:31.420* :  and as Gurkhas are allowed to fight in the militaries.
*11:31.880- 11:36.240* :  And many of the relatives are now coming forward and complaining with the Nepali government
*11:36.240- 11:38.040* :  that our relatives are there.
*11:38.040- 11:41.180* :  So it is a job of the Nepal government to bring them back.
*11:41.500- 11:43.900* :  At the same time the Nepali police have also arisen.
*11:44.460- 11:48.200* :  More than a dozen people suspected of trafficking these men into Russia.
*11:48.780- 11:52.420* :  But however they insist that so far they have not found any direct involvement
*11:52.420- 11:54.480* :  of Russia in recruiting these people.
*11:55.080- 11:57.400* :  And Barassan et Aarajan in Delhi.
*11:58.540- 12:02.480* :  In the past year the US has seen a record number of book bans.
*12:02.480- 12:06.840* :  Many of them in schools affecting millions of children across the country.
*12:07.200- 12:11.160* :  Those calling for the bans say they're protecting children from unsuitable content.
*12:11.160- 12:14.340* :  But campaigners say it's stifling free speech.
*12:15.040- 12:18.060* :  Annie Frommion reports from St. Petersburg in Florida,
*12:18.340- 12:20.860* :  the state with the highest number of book bans.
*12:21.500- 12:27.940* :  I know Charlotte's web has been banned because they said it was unnatural for animals to be speaking English.
*12:27.940- 12:33.480* :  Grace, who is 12, is showing me books on a shelf in her bedroom.
*12:34.340- 12:37.040* :  Magnus Chase and the hammer of Thor and Magnus Chase
*12:37.220- 12:39.540* :  and the ship of the dead, those two have been banned.
*12:39.840- 12:43.620* :  For a class project she's built a free book exchange in front of her school.
*12:43.620- 12:46.600* :  She's asking the public to donate banned books.
*12:46.600- 12:50.360* :  2,532 to be precise.
*12:51.060- 12:53.820* :  That's the number of book restrictions pen America,
*12:54.360- 12:57.620* :  which campaigns for freedom of expression in literature
*12:57.620- 13:00.620* :  counted in the United States last year.
*13:01.020- 13:02.660* :  It hurts the kids too.
*13:03.280- 13:06.820* :  Because they might come from backgrounds that are the content that's being banned.
*13:06.820- 13:10.140* :  They might come from backgrounds with two parents of the same gender,
*13:10.720- 13:12.080* :  different ethnicities, different races.
*13:12.300- 13:15.260* :  And then when you ban these books because of that reason they look at that
*13:15.260- 13:17.320* :  and they say, am I being banned?
*13:17.400- 13:19.980* :  Am I not appropriate for people to read?
*13:20.460- 13:25.040* :  Good evening everyone, and welcome to the District Instructional Materials Review Committee.
*13:25.600- 13:30.240* :  I'm at a Pinellas County School District meeting for the lovely bones by Alice Seapold.
*13:30.480- 13:32.880* :  There was complaint against the book made in August,
*13:32.940- 13:36.940* :  which meant it was taken off the shelves in all of the district schools.
*13:36.940- 13:41.560* :  It's being discussed now, months later, to see if it can return.
*13:42.120- 13:45.940* :  The challenger believes the text violates one of Florida's obscenity laws
*13:46.460- 13:47.800* :  and shouldn't be distributed.
*13:48.460- 13:51.740* :  What's caused the most confusion is House Bill 1069,
*13:51.940- 13:55.660* :  which prohibits materials in schools that contain sexual conduct.
*13:56.340- 13:58.580* :  But because the term is so vague,
*13:58.660- 14:01.540* :  there are even schools that are preemptively pulled books
*14:01.920- 14:03.900* :  as they don't want to face criminal charges.
*14:04.460- 14:06.940* :  Books like this have zero educational value.
*14:06.940- 14:10.420* :  I meet Angela Dubock, who is challenging the book.
*14:10.900- 14:12.360* :  She's from Mom's For Liberty.
*14:12.820- 14:15.200* :  It's a national conservative campaign group.
*14:15.560- 14:19.000* :  She says the lovely bones is inappropriate for middle schoolers.
*14:19.220- 14:20.680* :  That's ages 11 and up.
*14:20.820- 14:23.540* :  The book deals with a teenager's rape and murder.
*14:23.820- 14:29.080* :  My objection was based on the fact that it's very, very sexual explicit
*14:29.380- 14:31.380* :  and I don't think that's appropriate for minors.
*14:31.500- 14:35.940* :  If you have to rely on a book to help you deal with something,
*14:36.340- 14:37.700* :  I just kind of have a problem with that.
*14:37.740- 14:39.640* :  I just think that that's a parental thing.
*14:39.940- 14:42.440* :  You know, if your child is raped or killed or whatever,
*14:43.900- 14:45.340* :  you got to deal with that as a parent.
*14:45.680- 14:48.580* :  It doesn't make sense to me to turn to a book to ease your pain.
*14:49.280- 14:53.440* :  Florida is responsible for more than 40% of the bookpanes
*14:53.500- 14:54.340* :  in the United States.
*14:54.740- 14:57.440* :  This is the highest number out of any state.
*14:58.000- 15:01.200* :  The vast majority are coming from a few conservative counties
*15:01.580- 15:04.200* :  and are requested by only a few individuals.
*15:04.680- 15:09.460* :  It's been so divisive and honestly very hurtful to librarians
*15:09.500- 15:10.380* :  who really...
*15:10.380- 15:14.900* :  Chris Smith is the president of the Florida Association of Media and Education.
*15:15.480- 15:18.200* :  They're a group of librarians and media specialists
*15:18.440- 15:20.760* :  who have a role in making book suggestions.
*15:21.660- 15:23.840* :  We are doing everything we can to improve literacy
*15:24.200- 15:27.480* :  and trying to increase stamina of reading right now,
*15:27.480- 15:30.100* :  which, you know, the learning loss from COVID,
*15:30.300- 15:32.060* :  which was already starting to kind of happen.
*15:32.520- 15:35.460* :  But the ability for a student to really read a chapter book,
*15:35.760- 15:37.760* :  that really should be concerning to everybody.
*15:38.240- 15:42.300* :  We need to be worried about getting kids to read in depth and breadth.
*15:42.780- 15:47.040* :  It should be on everybody's radar kind of more than one paragraph
*15:47.840- 15:49.160* :  that bothers you.
*15:49.500- 15:52.480* :  Campaigners say bookbans have hit record highs this year,
*15:52.840- 15:55.280* :  in Florida and across the U.S.
*15:55.580- 15:58.080* :  They worry that efforts to restrict books
*15:58.320- 16:00.480* :  so far and largely focused on schools
*16:01.020- 16:02.960* :  will also spread to public libraries
*16:02.960- 16:06.120* :  and further deepen America's cultural divisions.
*16:06.820- 16:08.520* :  Annie, fromion with that report.
*16:11.700- 16:13.340* :  Still to come in this podcast,
*16:13.340- 16:15.480* :  like a Phoenix from the Ashes,
*16:15.500- 16:18.780* :  the return of Mexico's state airline,
*16:18.780- 16:19.700* :  Mexicana.
*16:19.960- 16:23.340* :  What's interesting is it's controlled by the armed forces
*16:24.000- 16:27.820* :  and the armed forces have been gaining access to new areas.
*16:33.520- 16:35.100* :  Remarkable personal stories.
*16:35.260- 16:35.920* :  Trail.
*16:36.120- 16:38.420* :  It runs through my life and runs through my story.
*16:38.720- 16:39.840* :  Deep dive documentaries.
*16:40.320- 16:42.360* :  These children are using their own bags,
*16:42.840- 16:43.800* :  not to carry books,
*16:44.120- 16:45.720* :  but they carry the drug markets
*16:46.120- 16:47.780* :  Sweden on their shoulders.
*16:48.200- 16:50.580* :  And sports, but not as you know it.
*16:50.660- 16:52.680* :  There's this massive landslide of myth
*16:53.060- 16:54.840* :  and somewhere in there is the truth.
*16:54.840- 16:57.740* :  The BBC World Service tells the world's stories.
*16:58.220- 16:59.600* :  Search for lives less ordinary,
*16:59.600- 17:02.120* :  the documentary and amazing sport stories,
*17:02.460- 17:04.000* :  wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:07.160- 17:09.960* :  In Sudan, eight months of fighting between the army
*17:09.960- 17:13.140* :  and the powerful paramilitary force known as the RSF,
*17:13.520- 17:15.820* :  of course, one of the largest displacements of people
*17:16.060- 17:17.000* :  anywhere in the world.
*17:17.000- 17:18.960* :  More than six and a half million people
*17:19.360- 17:21.020* :  estimated to have fled their homes.
*17:21.460- 17:23.380* :  Many more are trapped in the war zone
*17:23.380- 17:25.060* :  with very little to survive on.
*17:25.420- 17:27.500* :  Eight agencies have struggled to access the areas
*17:27.500- 17:29.480* :  where most of the fighting has been going on,
*17:29.840- 17:33.060* :  and a warning that the crisis could soon deteriorate rapidly.
*17:33.560- 17:35.380* :  The BBC's Anne Sawyer has been hearing
*17:35.380- 17:37.200* :  from a family that's been trapped for months
*17:37.200- 17:39.480* :  in the Crossfire in the capital Khartoum.
*17:40.180- 17:42.360* :  You can see my baby's bed over there.
*17:42.960- 17:45.400* :  A part of the missile came through the AC.
*17:46.160- 17:47.320* :  That's Russia Amin.
*17:47.900- 17:49.480* :  She's showing me where virtual video,
*17:50.260- 17:51.480* :  the damage a missile strike caused.
*17:51.480- 17:53.500* :  It was aimed at Hannibal's house,
*17:54.600- 17:55.520* :  which had been taken over by armed men.
*17:57.300- 17:59.480* :  Luckily, no one in her home got injured.
*18:00.280- 18:02.540* :  We're still scared because we have to put our mattresses
*18:03.400- 18:05.500* :  on the floor away from the windows.
*18:06.420- 18:08.500* :  We hear their machine guns around us.
*18:08.700- 18:11.500* :  So we have to stay as safe as possible
*18:12.340- 18:14.600* :  A five-year-old son interrupts the call.
*18:15.240- 18:17.300* :  The war has had an impact on him.
*18:17.420- 18:20.080* :  After that shock, he started to wet his bed
*18:20.360- 18:21.720* :  and now he cries every night
*18:21.720- 18:23.800* :  because he saw a nightmare or he was scared.
*18:23.800- 18:28.560* :  The grass keeps pinching his feet.
*18:28.560- 18:32.200* :  The family has only left their home once during the war.
*18:32.680- 18:35.060* :  Russia's husband, Muhammad, is London-born.
*18:35.580- 18:37.820* :  He's a British citizen and so are her children.
*18:38.600- 18:40.340* :  So when evacuations were announced,
*18:40.860- 18:42.400* :  they hoped to get out of Sudan.
*18:43.320- 18:45.540* :  But their hopes were cautious when they got there.
*18:46.180- 18:47.920* :  The officer, he said,
*18:48.540- 18:52.120* :  the husband can go and the kids can go and leave me behind.
*18:52.820- 18:54.640* :  So we decided to stay.
*18:55.460- 18:57.420* :  Russia tells me they've written multiple emails
*18:57.420- 18:59.080* :  to different officers in the UK
*18:59.760- 19:01.680* :  but only get automated messages back.
*19:02.400- 19:05.280* :  They are stuck in the war zone with limited supplies.
*19:09.000- 19:11.340* :  The conflict has now spread to Gazeera State.
*19:11.780- 19:13.100* :  The country's bread basket
*19:13.520- 19:15.200* :  and one of the last remaining sanctuaries
*19:15.280- 19:16.640* :  for displaced Sudanese.
*19:17.640- 19:19.260* :  Nearly 18 million people.
*19:20.060- 19:22.260* :  That's a population the size of the Netherlands
*19:22.260- 19:24.640* :  are now facing acute hunger.
*19:24.960- 19:28.940* :  That's the World Food Program's spokesperson for Sudan, Lenny Kinzli.
*19:29.100- 19:31.720* :  Now what is going to happen if farmers are also forced to flee?
*19:32.160- 19:34.740* :  And what does that mean for food availability across the country?
*19:35.380- 19:38.320* :  So the catastrophic hunger that we were warning about before
*19:38.860- 19:39.820* :  could be even worse
*19:40.260- 19:43.700* :  with the impacts of the conflict in this Sudan's bread basket.
*19:46.520- 19:49.780* :  Talks aimed at finding a political solution have not gone far.
*19:50.420- 19:52.060* :  General Abdul Fata Al-Bruhan,
*19:52.060- 19:54.640* :  the country's de facto leader and head of the army,
*19:54.640- 19:57.440* :  has vowed to fight to victory or death.
*19:58.140- 20:01.480* :  His rival, who hates the powerful paramilitary force RSF,
*20:01.920- 20:02.880* :  has been gaining ground.
*20:03.620- 20:06.360* :  The group has been accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing
*20:06.400- 20:08.320* :  in the western region of Darfur.
*20:08.780- 20:10.540* :  Claims RSF denies.
*20:11.320- 20:13.320* :  The American and British governments have said
*20:13.420- 20:15.320* :  both sides have committed war crimes.
*20:15.920- 20:18.460* :  Here's the UK Minister for Africa, Andrew Mitchell.
*20:18.880- 20:20.320* :  Well, we will do everything we can,
*20:20.320- 20:23.500* :  along with allies and like-minded people
*20:23.520- 20:26.200* :  to bring those who perpetrate
*20:27.020- 20:29.320* :  any form of human rights abuse
*20:29.440- 20:32.080* :  and breaches of international humanitarian law
*20:32.280- 20:32.900* :  to account.
*20:34.820- 20:36.880* :  It's been described as a senseless war.
*20:37.340- 20:39.480* :  Millions of civilians have been caught in the middle,
*20:40.000- 20:41.560* :  lost everything, and fled.
*20:42.000- 20:45.640* :  Or, like Russia, remained trapped in the war zone.
*20:48.280- 20:49.540* :  And soy reporting.
*20:50.920- 20:52.840* :  Sand shells, seaweed,
*20:52.840- 20:55.680* :  just some of the souvenirs you might well expect
*20:55.680- 20:57.440* :  to pick up on a trip to the beach.
*20:57.580- 21:00.780* :  But some members of the public in the Australian state of New South Wales
*21:01.480- 21:03.100* :  have gone a bit more than they bargained for
*21:03.100- 21:04.540* :  during their seaside visit
*21:04.540- 21:07.740* :  as our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Hatton, explains.
*21:08.480- 21:12.120* :  Police have had a very busy Christmas period, Alex.
*21:12.160- 21:14.900* :  That's because just before Christmas,
*21:14.900- 21:18.800* :  packages containing cocaine started washing up
*21:19.360- 21:21.760* :  on beaches in New South Wales.
*21:22.340- 21:25.280* :  Every day, it seems, a few more packages have arrived,
*21:25.280- 21:27.700* :  two quite large shipments,
*21:27.700- 21:31.820* :  39 packages in total and two different places have arrived.
*21:31.820- 21:36.800* :  So totaling 124 kilograms of cocaine
*21:36.800- 21:39.680* :  have washed up on beaches in one area.
*21:39.680- 21:44.560* :  That's got a street value of around $33 million US dollars.
*21:44.720- 21:48.640* :  So that's kept police busy looking for extra packages
*21:48.640- 21:51.760* :  of cocaine themselves and also appealing to the public
*21:51.760- 21:55.960* :  to turn any other packages that wash up into the police
*21:55.960- 21:58.620* :  so that they can submit them for forensic testing
*21:58.620- 22:02.340* :  and try to figure out who's behind all of this cocaine.
*22:03.020- 22:03.700* :  What are they saying?
*22:04.080- 22:08.480* :  They're really concerned that this is just one small tip
*22:08.480- 22:11.180* :  of the iceberg, really, when it comes to cocaine trafficking
*22:11.180- 22:12.400* :  in Australia.
*22:12.400- 22:14.920* :  You know, police seizures of cocaine
*22:14.920- 22:18.440* :  more than doubled in 2023 in Australia.
*22:18.560- 22:22.280* :  That's because it's really a lucrative market for cocaine.
*22:22.280- 22:25.480* :  And so they suspect that traffickers are really just doing
*22:25.480- 22:29.160* :  whatever they can to try to get the drug into the country.
*22:29.160- 22:31.900* :  They say traffickers methodologies,
*22:32.000- 22:34.900* :  the way that they ship cocaine is constantly changing
*22:34.900- 22:36.280* :  in order to evade police.
*22:36.440- 22:39.200* :  So sometimes they use couriers on board,
*22:39.200- 22:42.460* :  cruise ships to try to carry the drugs into the country.
*22:42.460- 22:45.860* :  Sometimes they attach the goods to the hulls of ships.
*22:45.860- 22:49.980* :  Sometimes they even just do drops at sea and then people
*22:49.980- 22:52.780* :  in boats try to go out and try to retrieve the cocaine.
*22:52.780- 22:56.000* :  And that's possibly where these shipments of cocaine
*22:56.000- 22:59.220* :  that have been washing up on coastlines really came from.
*23:00.040- 23:00.820* :  Celia Hatton.
*23:01.780- 23:04.000* :  The authorities in South Korea have confirmed
*23:04.000- 23:06.940* :  that the actor, Lee Sun-kyun, best known for his role
*23:07.020- 23:09.880* :  in the Oscar-winning social satire parasite,
*23:09.880- 23:12.520* :  has been found dead in an apparent suicide.
*23:12.520- 23:16.600* :  Police say they found his body in his car in one of Seoul's main parks.
*23:16.600- 23:21.560* :  It recently been questioned by police investigating alleged illegal drug use.
*23:22.080- 23:25.100* :  In 2020, parasite made history at the Oscars
*23:25.100- 23:28.860* :  becoming the first international film to win best picture.
*23:29.240- 23:31.700* :  The BBC's Nick Marsh is in Seoul and told me more.
*23:32.420- 23:36.940* :  Before finding this body in a park in Seoul,
*23:36.940- 23:41.340* :  which has been now confirmed to us to be the body of Lee Sun-kyun, the actor,
*23:41.760- 23:46.140* :  the police had received a report that he'd left his house
*23:46.140- 23:48.620* :  and he'd left some kind of memo,
*23:49.140- 23:51.220* :  which appears to be a suicide note.
*23:51.220- 23:55.960* :  Now, I say appears because we haven't had the cause of death confirmed yet
*23:55.960- 23:57.840* :  by the police or any authorities,
*23:58.620- 24:02.380* :  but it is being reported as an apparent suicide,
*24:02.380- 24:05.960* :  but I should stress, right now we don't know the exact cause,
*24:05.960- 24:07.860* :  but that's the way it's been reported in local media.
*24:08.240- 24:12.080* :  Because it's also reported he was being investigated for drug offenses,
*24:12.080- 24:14.400* :  which is very serious in South Korea, isn't it?
*24:15.060- 24:18.020* :  Yes, he was since October he's been under investigation
*24:18.320- 24:21.740* :  by the police for alleged drug use.
*24:22.240- 24:26.940* :  Now, we're talking about a huge star here in Lee Sun-kyun.
*24:28.140- 24:31.360* :  The story was that he'd been visiting a hostess bar,
*24:31.360- 24:34.100* :  which is quite salacious in and of itself.
*24:34.100- 24:35.340* :  Now, he doesn't deny that.
*24:35.760- 24:38.460* :  What he does deny is that he was taking drugs there.
*24:38.920- 24:41.480* :  And like you said, drug use is very serious in South Korea.
*24:41.480- 24:43.480* :  You can get a quite substantial jail time,
*24:43.480- 24:45.660* :  even for just using a small amount.
*24:46.220- 24:50.360* :  Now, the allegation was that he'd been using ketamine marijuana.
*24:51.620- 24:54.800* :  Lee said that he didn't know what he was taking, was drugs.
*24:54.800- 24:56.820* :  And he actually said he'd been blackmailed.
*24:57.260- 25:00.820* :  Now, that ended up with questioning by the police.
*25:01.140- 25:04.820* :  And over the weekend, there was this marathon session of questioning
*25:05.460- 25:07.280* :  19 hours overnight.
*25:08.100- 25:10.600* :  And that is the last we know of this case
*25:10.600- 25:12.740* :  until we found out this sad news this morning.
*25:13.420- 25:16.280* :  Because he really was a huge star, wasn't he?
*25:17.040- 25:18.000* :  Yeah, he was a household name.
*25:18.280- 25:22.120* :  Even before Parasite, Lee Sun-kyun was a leading man
*25:22.120- 25:25.100* :  in romcoms, in dramas, in TV shows.
*25:25.860- 25:29.040* :  Everything obviously changed for him in terms of his international fame
*25:29.600- 25:32.120* :  when he played the role of the father
*25:32.300- 25:33.780* :  in the park family in Parasite.
*25:33.900- 25:37.180* :  You know, that's smash hit movie directed by Bong Joong Ho
*25:37.720- 25:38.260* :  in 2019.
*25:38.260- 25:41.420* :  And it's social satire about wealth inequality in South Korea
*25:41.420- 25:42.780* :  while in the Oscar for Best Picture.
*25:43.820- 25:45.460* :  You know, that really put him on the world stage.
*25:45.460- 25:49.480* :  But here in South Korea, you know, he was this squeaky clean family man.
*25:49.620- 25:51.840* :  He was the face of several brands here.
*25:52.520- 25:53.480* :  They dropped him.
*25:53.480- 25:58.360* :  The brands wants these drug investigation reports started to emerge.
*25:59.040- 26:02.120* :  He actually had a show, which was due for release soon as well.
*26:02.600- 26:04.500* :  There's talk that that could have been pulled as well.
*26:04.720- 26:06.460* :  So, you know, we're really talking about a man
*26:06.460- 26:09.500* :  who's had his life turned upside down in the past three months.
*26:09.500- 26:13.480* :  And he's not the only celebrity to be investigated for drug use.
*26:13.480- 26:17.020* :  We know that the government here is starting to crack down harder and harder on drugs
*26:17.640- 26:21.160* :  and high profile names like Lee's have been appearing in news reports
*26:21.160- 26:22.640* :  and police investigations.
*26:23.160- 26:23.700* :  Nick Marshall.
*26:25.100- 26:29.280* :  For many years, any self-respecting country wanted its own national airline.
*26:29.280- 26:31.320* :  It's state-owned flag carrier.
*26:31.560- 26:34.180* :  But in recent times, airlines from different countries
*26:34.740- 26:36.780* :  have been coming together under a single brand.
*26:36.780- 26:42.280* :  Now, Mexico is bucking the trend by relaunching Mexicana nearly 20 years
*26:42.640- 26:43.600* :  after it was privatized.
*26:43.920- 26:47.220* :  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia told us why.
*26:47.780- 26:53.340* :  Well, that's very much part of the vision of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
*26:53.340- 26:56.160* :  He's a man who believes in this big state project
*26:56.800- 26:58.620* :  and the state leading the development.
*26:59.320- 27:03.980* :  So, the company went bankrupt a while ago after being privatized
*27:04.320- 27:08.800* :  and they bought it back from the owners in August for about 50 million dollars.
*27:09.420- 27:15.560* :  He says an airline like that will run to places where the commercial airlines don't want to go.
*27:16.260- 27:19.760* :  Also, there are airports, small airports that are being built by the government
*27:19.760- 27:21.520* :  that will be used by them.
*27:22.000- 27:26.260* :  So, in a way, they will provide the cheaper service and will help develop those regions.
*27:26.620- 27:30.980* :  The first flight was from Mexico City, a new airport built outside Mexico City
*27:31.500- 27:35.760* :  to the resort city of Tulum, near Cancún, on the Caribbean coast.
*27:36.180- 27:41.480* :  And that's where the President, a week ago, was inaugurating, opening his Maya train,
*27:41.480- 27:43.960* :  which is also a big project in the region.
*27:44.200- 27:47.720* :  There was a time when most countries had their own national airline.
*27:47.860- 27:52.400* :  Many countries also thought that if they didn't have the security, it was threatened.
*27:53.020- 27:54.960* :  So, of course, that's not the case anymore.
*27:54.960- 27:58.220* :  I mean, Mexican is a small airline at the moment.
*27:58.220- 27:59.800* :  It has only three airplanes.
*27:59.800- 28:03.220* :  It will buy another 10 airplanes next year.
*28:03.740- 28:07.500* :  So, it won't cover the whole demand for flights in Mexico.
*28:07.500- 28:10.720* :  But it will give the government some power as well.
*28:10.800- 28:14.240* :  And what's interesting is it's controlled by the armed forces.
*28:14.860- 28:19.420* :  And the armed forces have been gaining access to new areas in Mexico,
*28:19.480- 28:22.540* :  where they didn't have, say, for example, national parks.
*28:22.920- 28:25.720* :  They were involved, of course, in tackling the drug gangs,
*28:26.100- 28:28.220* :  but also controlling airports and airlines.
*28:28.680- 28:29.640* :  Leonardo, Russia.
*28:32.240- 28:34.440* :  And that's all from us for now.
*28:34.500- 28:38.340* :  But there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*28:38.620- 28:42.680* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
