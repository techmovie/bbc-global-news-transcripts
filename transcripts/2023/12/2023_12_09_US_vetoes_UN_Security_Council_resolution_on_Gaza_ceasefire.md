*01:41.060- 01:42.140* :  from the BBC World Service.
*01:44.780- 01:46.680* :  I'm Nick Miles, and in the early hours of Saturday,
*01:46.680- 01:48.780* :  the 9th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:49.180- 01:52.620* :  The United States has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution
*01:53.080- 01:55.240* :  calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza,
*01:56.040- 01:57.940* :  describing the measure as a recipe for disaster.
*01:58.540- 02:01.540* :  The Israeli military says Hamas has reorganized
*02:01.540- 02:05.320* :  and is fighting for every centimeter in the city of Han Unis.
*02:05.780- 02:08.640* :  In other news, a former Prime Minister of Burundi
*02:08.660- 02:10.440* :  has been sentenced to life in prison
*02:10.620- 02:12.860* :  for crimes including using witchcraft
*02:12.980- 02:14.500* :  to threaten the president's life.
*02:17.780- 02:18.640* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:19.000- 02:21.120* :  Shane was such a lovely person
*02:21.280- 02:24.840* :  and he certainly represented in some ways the diaspora
*02:25.500- 02:27.600* :  across the world, and we loved him.
*02:27.900- 02:31.100* :  A heartfelt final send-off for an Irish Balladier.
*02:34.600- 02:38.280* :  The United States has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution
*02:38.280- 02:41.760* :  in New York calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
*02:42.360- 02:45.540* :  The US representative, Robert Wood, said the draft text
*02:45.540- 02:49.000* :  would allow Hamas to regroup and continue to commit
*02:49.000- 02:50.480* :  what he called terror attacks.
*02:51.020- 02:53.460* :  He described the resolution as a recipe for disaster
*02:53.460- 02:55.780* :  which would plant the seeds for the next war.
*02:56.460- 02:59.420* :  And so, we regretfully could not support it.
*03:00.520- 03:03.940* :  We still cannot comprehend why the resolution's authors
*03:04.400- 03:08.020* :  declined to include language condemning Hamas's horrific
*03:08.400- 03:10.920* :  terrorist attack on Israel on October 7.
*03:12.360- 03:16.520* :  An attack that killed over 1,200 people, women, children,
*03:17.100- 03:20.600* :  the elderly, people from a range of nationalities,
*03:21.720- 03:27.700* :  burned alive, gunned down, subject to obscene sexual violence.
*03:28.380- 03:31.860* :  Well, 13 of the council's 15 members voted in favor
*03:31.860- 03:34.120* :  of the resolution with the UK abstaining.
*03:34.620- 03:37.140* :  Earlier, the UN Secretary-General Antonia Guterres
*03:37.520- 03:39.360* :  issued this warning regarding Gaza.
*03:39.940- 03:41.960* :  We are at the breaking point.
*03:43.180- 03:45.500* :  There is a high risk of the total collapse
*03:45.500- 03:48.020* :  of the humanitarian support system in Gaza
*03:49.000- 03:51.400* :  which should have devastating consequences.
*03:52.780- 03:56.580* :  We anticipate that it will result in a complete breakdown
*03:56.580- 03:59.500* :  of public order and increased pressure
*03:59.500- 04:01.940* :  for mass displacement into Egypt.
*04:02.500- 04:05.220* :  Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan,
*04:05.220- 04:07.680* :  had earlier told the council why his country
*04:07.680- 04:09.920* :  was against pausing its military operation.
*04:10.480- 04:13.180* :  Calling for a ceasefire sends a clear message
*04:13.860- 04:18.200* :  that Hamas is forgiven for their deliberate atrocities
*04:18.620- 04:21.960* :  and Hamas' oppression of Gaza is given a green light
*04:21.960- 04:23.960* :  by the international community.
*04:24.520- 04:26.420* :  Hamas, like any terror entity,
*04:26.460- 04:29.860* :  only responds when its existence is threatened.
*04:29.880- 04:33.180* :  And without the military pressure applied on Hamas,
*04:33.620- 04:38.020* :  no amount of diplomacy can secure the release of hostages.
*04:38.620- 04:42.680* :  The deputy UAE ambassador to the UN, Muhammad Abu Shahab,
*04:42.680- 04:45.420* :  had this to say after the resolution failed to pass.
*04:46.220- 04:46.860* :  Mr. President,
*04:47.960- 04:50.160* :  the United Arab Emirates is deeply disappointed
*04:50.160- 04:51.860* :  with the outcome of today's vote.
*04:53.000- 04:55.660* :  Regrettably, and in the face of untold misery,
*04:56.320- 04:59.480* :  this council is unable to demand a humanitarian ceasefire.
*05:00.980- 05:03.600* :  Let me be clear, against the backdrop
*05:03.600- 05:05.740* :  of the Secretary General's grave warnings,
*05:06.880- 05:08.760* :  the appeals by humanitarian actors,
*05:09.780- 05:13.980* :  the world's public opinion, this council grows isolated.
*05:14.960- 05:18.260* :  It appears untethered from its own founding document.
*05:19.560- 05:21.380* :  What is the message we are sending Palestinians
*05:21.380- 05:24.180* :  if we cannot unite behind a call to halt
*05:24.180- 05:26.420* :  the relentless bombardment of Gaza?
*05:27.060- 05:28.500* :  Well, regarding the US veto,
*05:28.500- 05:31.740* :  human rights watch said Washington risked complicity
*05:31.740- 05:32.800* :  in war crimes.
*05:33.420- 05:35.460* :  Our correspondent, Nerdotovic, is in New York
*05:35.460- 05:38.860* :  and has this assessment of the UN Secretary General's attempt
*05:38.860- 05:42.020* :  to secure the security councils backing for a ceasefire.
*05:42.720- 05:45.480* :  A rare push there for the Secretary General
*05:45.480- 05:48.640* :  to get the Security Council to demand an immediate ceasefire
*05:48.640- 05:51.740* :  by invoking article 99 of the UN charter,
*05:51.740- 05:54.440* :  a power granted to Secretary Generals,
*05:54.640- 05:55.920* :  but rarely used.
*05:55.920- 05:57.780* :  It hasn't been used in decades.
*05:57.900- 06:01.300* :  But nevertheless, what we saw here at the UN
*06:01.300- 06:04.480* :  was a quick reaction to the Secretary General's call
*06:04.940- 06:08.680* :  with 97 nations sponsoring a draft resolution
*06:08.680- 06:10.840* :  calling for a ceasefire.
*06:11.200- 06:13.640* :  But the United States cutting a lonely figure
*06:13.880- 06:16.020* :  and showing its growing isolation
*06:16.520- 06:19.760* :  by being the sole member of the council to veto
*06:20.220- 06:22.660* :  and block that resolution from being passed.
*06:22.980- 06:25.740* :  Now, the United States has accepted Israel's argument
*06:25.740- 06:28.400* :  that a ceasefire would only help Hamas,
*06:28.760- 06:30.740* :  but much of the world disagrees.
*06:30.960- 06:34.040* :  In fact, 13 of the 15 members voted in favor
*06:34.040- 06:36.680* :  of this resolution, the UK abstained.
*06:37.100- 06:39.080* :  And they very much, these members
*06:39.080- 06:40.880* :  who voted in favor of this resolution,
*06:41.400- 06:43.480* :  echoed the Secretary General's words
*06:43.480- 06:45.920* :  that this was a breaking point for Gaza,
*06:45.920- 06:48.360* :  and they must uphold their responsibility
*06:48.420- 06:50.340* :  to help the Palestinian civilians.
*06:50.800- 06:51.520* :  Nerdotrophic.
*06:52.200- 06:55.020* :  Aid agencies say the humanitarian situation in Gaza
*06:55.020- 06:57.740* :  is deteriorating rapidly with one warning
*06:57.740- 07:00.640* :  that civilization in the besieged Palestinian territory
*07:00.980- 07:02.000* :  is about to break down.
*07:02.660- 07:05.580* :  The Israeli military says it stepped up its offensive,
*07:05.580- 07:08.860* :  striking several hundred targets over the past 24 hours.
*07:09.420- 07:11.180* :  Intensified fighting has been reported
*07:11.180- 07:12.900* :  both in northern areas of Gaza,
*07:12.900- 07:15.040* :  where Israel previously said its troops
*07:15.340- 07:16.880* :  had largely completed their tasks
*07:17.320- 07:20.000* :  and in the south where a new assault began this week.
*07:20.600- 07:22.260* :  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams
*07:22.260- 07:24.520* :  is in Jerusalem from where he sent this report.
*07:25.280- 07:27.760* :  Israel's military campaign in the north and south
*07:27.760- 07:30.140* :  of the Gaza Strip has lost none of its intensity.
*07:30.680- 07:32.040* :  A government spokesman this morning
*07:32.040- 07:34.020* :  said that over the previous 24 hours,
*07:34.020- 07:38.240* :  Israel had attacked 450 targets from land, sea, and air.
*07:38.660- 07:40.100* :  It's a remarkably high number.
*07:42.060- 07:43.020* :  Near the Raffa crossing,
*07:43.020- 07:46.060* :  destitute Palestinians crowd around a UN car.
*07:46.480- 07:47.700* :  They're desperate for assistance,
*07:48.100- 07:50.180* :  but aid agencies are struggling to keep up
*07:50.180- 07:52.280* :  with the war's humanitarian consequences.
*07:53.060- 07:57.600* :  85% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have now been displaced,
*07:57.600- 07:59.640* :  some of them multiple times.
*08:00.240- 08:02.820* :  Jason Lee is working in Raffa for Save the Children.
*08:03.100- 08:04.580* :  When I look out the window now,
*08:04.580- 08:07.680* :  I see tents being erected everywhere.
*08:08.240- 08:10.920* :  Wherever there is space next in front of hospitals,
*08:11.360- 08:12.880* :  civilians have nowhere to run.
*08:13.400- 08:14.720* :  The shelters are overflowing,
*08:15.480- 08:17.420* :  and they're essentially putting up tents everywhere
*08:17.420- 08:20.180* :  trying to find as much water, food as they can.
*08:20.980- 08:24.220* :  And of course, there is not enough sanitation facilities.
*08:24.740- 08:26.880* :  Washington is showing signs of losing patience.
*08:26.880- 08:28.960* :  The Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken,
*08:28.960- 08:31.960* :  saying there's a gap between Israel's stated intention
*08:31.960- 08:35.540* :  to protect civilians and the actual results unfolding
*08:35.540- 08:36.220* :  on the ground.
*08:37.400- 08:38.220* :  This concern, too,
*08:38.380- 08:40.520* :  over the fate of dozens of Palestinian men
*08:40.520- 08:42.100* :  seen in this video yesterday,
*08:42.560- 08:43.640* :  stripped to their underwear,
*08:44.040- 08:46.540* :  sitting cowed in a street in the northern Gaza strip
*08:46.920- 08:48.720* :  being watched over by Israeli soldiers.
*08:49.440- 08:51.800* :  Other images showed them being driven away in a truck
*08:52.140- 08:54.740* :  or sitting in a large patch of bulldozed sand
*08:54.740- 08:57.940* :  blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs.
*08:58.580- 09:01.700* :  Israel says it detained them as possible hammer suspects,
*09:02.260- 09:04.700* :  Mark Reggev, a senior adviser to the Prime Minister,
*09:05.120- 09:06.880* :  says troops acted with caution.
*09:07.000- 09:08.940* :  The reason they're asked to take their shirts off
*09:08.940- 09:11.540* :  is because we don't want people with suicide bombings,
*09:11.540- 09:13.840* :  with explosives who will hurt our people.
*09:13.840- 09:14.740* :  Yes, our soldiers.
*09:14.740- 09:16.920* :  We've already had too many soldiers fall in battle.
*09:16.920- 09:19.240* :  Some of the detainees have already been released.
*09:19.640- 09:21.020* :  Others are still being questioned,
*09:21.500- 09:23.180* :  whoever filmed and released the images,
*09:23.460- 09:25.760* :  and it's not clear if this was officially sanctioned,
*09:26.120- 09:28.840* :  seems keen to show that Israel is gradually gaining
*09:28.840- 09:29.700* :  the upper hand.
*09:30.020- 09:30.480* :  Paul Adams.
*09:31.320- 09:32.980* :  As we heard in the earlier podcast,
*09:32.980- 09:35.440* :  Vladimir Putin has announced that he will stand
*09:35.440- 09:37.320* :  for re-election as Russian president,
*09:37.860- 09:39.380* :  telling an audience of military figures
*09:39.380- 09:40.960* :  there was no other way.
*09:41.420- 09:43.920* :  Mr. Putin's term of office expires next year
*09:43.920- 09:45.780* :  with elections due to be held in March.
*09:46.400- 09:48.640* :  Voting is expected to be largely a formality
*09:48.640- 09:50.420* :  with leading Russian opposition figures
*09:50.420- 09:53.960* :  either serving prison sentences or living in exile.
*09:54.660- 09:56.520* :  I asked our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg
*09:56.560- 09:58.520* :  whether he thought Mr. Putin had really
*09:58.520- 10:00.680* :  ever been in two minds about carrying on.
*10:01.320- 10:04.460* :  I think most people expected Vladimir Putin
*10:04.460- 10:06.660* :  to come out and say that he was going to run again.
*10:06.660- 10:08.400* :  So when you hear Vladimir Putin say,
*10:08.920- 10:10.220* :  well, I've had different thoughts,
*10:10.220- 10:11.840* :  you know, perhaps yes or perhaps no,
*10:12.260- 10:13.300* :  no, I don't buy that.
*10:13.300- 10:16.060* :  I think he wanted to give the impression
*10:16.760- 10:19.040* :  that he was being persuaded and talked into it
*10:19.180- 10:22.260* :  by the Russian people and that it was their decision
*10:22.740- 10:25.700* :  that had made him decide to run again.
*10:25.700- 10:27.860* :  But now I'm sure that he had already decided
*10:27.860- 10:29.520* :  he wants to remain in power.
*10:30.060- 10:33.480* :  And Steve, 22 months since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
*10:34.520- 10:36.740* :  big brands have pulled out since then
*10:36.740- 10:39.660* :  an estimated 200,000 Russian soldiers dead.
*10:40.200- 10:41.560* :  How popular is Mr. Putin?
*10:42.020- 10:43.660* :  It's a really interesting question.
*10:44.380- 10:45.960* :  If you listen to the Kremlin,
*10:45.960- 10:48.680* :  if you read the official opinion polls
*10:49.300- 10:51.620* :  by Pauling Agency's link to the state,
*10:52.160- 10:55.320* :  you will find that 75, 80% more than 80%
*10:55.320- 10:58.480* :  of the Russian people back, Vladimir Putin.
*10:58.940- 11:01.960* :  I don't think that's a particularly accurate picture.
*11:02.480- 11:05.080* :  Yes, a portion of society here
*11:05.420- 11:06.760* :  is fully behind the president.
*11:07.560- 11:11.480* :  But I think a majority don't care one way or the other.
*11:12.080- 11:14.180* :  Most Russians have come to the conclusion
*11:14.180- 11:16.940* :  that they can't influence what happens in their country.
*11:16.940- 11:20.340* :  They don't have the power to do that now in their country.
*11:21.040- 11:22.300* :  They can't influence the war,
*11:22.300- 11:24.240* :  they can't influence policies
*11:24.240- 11:25.460* :  that the government takes.
*11:25.460- 11:28.160* :  They can't influence who is going to become the next president.
*11:28.640- 11:30.500* :  So they shrug their shoulders
*11:30.500- 11:33.480* :  and they accept the situation as it is.
*11:33.900- 11:35.160* :  They don't see any alternative.
*11:35.460- 11:36.960* :  And there's a good reason for that.
*11:37.580- 11:38.880* :  Because over the last few years,
*11:39.160- 11:42.300* :  the Kremlin has done all it can to remove,
*11:42.500- 11:46.500* :  to clear away any potential rival to Vladimir Putin
*11:46.500- 11:48.100* :  and all his most vocal critics.
*11:48.660- 11:50.440* :  So if you look at the political landscape here,
*11:50.680- 11:51.740* :  they simply don't exist.
*11:51.740- 11:52.980* :  And that is why many people,
*11:53.320- 11:54.780* :  when you speak to a lot of Russians, they say,
*11:55.100- 11:57.300* :  well, if not Putin, then who else?
*11:58.340- 12:00.500* :  Which is astonishing when you think in a country
*12:00.500- 12:03.380* :  of 140 million people, you hear that so often.
*12:03.620- 12:06.060* :  And perhaps Mr. Putin will not leave anything to chance.
*12:06.060- 12:10.940* :  We can expect perhaps more crackdowns in the months to come.
*12:11.360- 12:13.840* :  I think of the run-up to the election in March.
*12:13.840- 12:16.220* :  What we're going to see from Vladimir Putin,
*12:16.840- 12:19.760* :  he's going to present himself as the defender of Russia
*12:19.760- 12:21.100* :  and the defender of Russians.
*12:21.140- 12:24.840* :  He'll most likely talk about a Russia under attack
*12:24.840- 12:27.260* :  from the West, from America, from NATO,
*12:27.260- 12:29.700* :  even though we mustn't forget that it was Russia
*12:30.140- 12:33.360* :  that actually invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago.
*12:33.980- 12:36.600* :  But he wants to style himself as the only person
*12:36.600- 12:40.820* :  really capable of protecting the world's largest country.
*12:41.060- 12:45.200* :  But he'll also be stressing that Russia has a future.
*12:45.200- 12:48.460* :  He'll be talking about, and he's already talking about Russia's
*12:48.460- 12:51.060* :  economic future by improving health care
*12:51.400- 12:54.160* :  and you buildings improving the roads and things like that.
*12:54.160- 12:56.500* :  This is what Russians want to hear.
*12:56.860- 12:59.500* :  Russians want to hear that their country has a future.
*13:00.280- 13:02.920* :  You know, past the special military operation
*13:03.500- 13:04.760* :  beyond the war in Ukraine.
*13:05.340- 13:06.080* :  Steve Ryzenberg.
*13:07.120- 13:09.040* :  The former Prime Minister of Burundi
*13:09.040- 13:12.400* :  has been sentenced to life in prison after the Supreme Court
*13:12.400- 13:14.040* :  found him guilty of several crimes,
*13:14.540- 13:17.980* :  including using witchcraft to threaten the president's life.
*13:18.600- 13:20.980* :  Alanguyon Bonignoni had denied any wrongdoing.
*13:21.400- 13:22.140* :  Well, Ross reports.
*13:22.940- 13:25.400* :  Alanguyon Bonignoni's fall has been dramatic.
*13:25.400- 13:28.920* :  He was in charge of Burundi's police force in 2015
*13:29.100- 13:32.240* :  when many people were angry that former President Pierre
*13:32.240- 13:34.380* :  and Koranziza was bending the rules
*13:34.380- 13:36.660* :  to run for a controversial third term.
*13:37.100- 13:39.220* :  The U.S. president at the time, Barack Obama,
*13:39.220- 13:41.300* :  imposed sanctions on him after the police
*13:41.300- 13:43.640* :  and the youth militia carried out operations
*13:43.640- 13:46.060* :  to intimidate and silence government critics.
*13:46.700- 13:49.100* :  This year, after being accused of using witchcraft
*13:49.100- 13:50.740* :  to kill off the current president,
*13:50.740- 13:53.240* :  Alanguyon Bonignoni went on trial.
*13:53.740- 13:55.140* :  It wasn't a transparent process,
*13:55.140- 13:56.300* :  and there may be an appeal,
*13:56.680- 13:58.420* :  but he's now due to serve a life sentence
*13:58.520- 13:59.780* :  and has had several properties
*13:59.780- 14:02.600* :  and 14 vehicles confiscated by the state.
*14:03.400- 14:03.860* :  Will Ross.
*14:05.140- 14:07.520* :  Africa currently produces less than 1%
*14:07.780- 14:09.900* :  of the vaccines it needs.
*14:10.760- 14:13.100* :  So why are so few vaccines made?
*14:13.100- 14:14.740* :  Well, the reasons might seem obvious.
*14:14.740- 14:17.280* :  Developing them from scratch is hugely expensive
*14:17.280- 14:19.800* :  and most of the big pharmaceutical companies
*14:20.180- 14:21.900* :  are based in the U.S. and Europe
*14:21.900- 14:23.420* :  and they control the patents.
*14:24.160- 14:25.860* :  Or to boost Africa's vaccine industry,
*14:25.860- 14:28.420* :  Gavi, that's the global vaccine alliance,
*14:28.500- 14:30.480* :  which is funded by groups like the Bill
*14:30.480- 14:32.020* :  and Melinda Gates Foundation,
*14:32.540- 14:34.820* :  is setting up a billion dollar fund.
*14:35.460- 14:37.680* :  BBC Africa reporter, Dorkas Wangira,
*14:38.180- 14:39.760* :  told me what the alliance can do.
*14:40.520- 14:43.480* :  One billion dollars may seem like a drop in the ocean
*14:43.480- 14:46.000* :  for continent with more than 50 countries.
*14:46.660- 14:48.540* :  However, Gavi was clear at the beginning
*14:48.540- 14:51.720* :  that this fast sends a signal to the global community
*14:52.340- 14:53.700* :  that there's a commitment to support
*14:53.700- 14:55.420* :  African manufacturing vaccines.
*14:56.060- 14:57.460* :  So it's just a fast step.
*14:58.200- 15:00.340* :  And what I remember from the board meeting
*15:00.340- 15:02.620* :  and the decision, they said that this will go
*15:03.220- 15:04.860* :  fast of all to the basics,
*15:05.680- 15:07.700* :  looking at the issue of the startup costs.
*15:08.900- 15:09.920* :  Like I know in December,
*15:10.700- 15:14.240* :  Rwanda, they're launching the biotech facility,
*15:14.240- 15:16.500* :  which is going to be manufacturing vaccines
*15:16.500- 15:17.680* :  with the mRNA technology.
*15:18.220- 15:20.800* :  So this funding will just help to go to countries first
*15:20.800- 15:22.840* :  for the very fast steps also
*15:23.360- 15:24.720* :  and also with the startup costs.
*15:25.240- 15:27.540* :  But in essence, it may seem like a small amount,
*15:27.540- 15:29.680* :  but it does send an important signal.
*15:30.240- 15:32.100* :  And this is all part of a very ambitious plan
*15:32.100- 15:33.400* :  going forward, isn't it?
*15:33.820- 15:36.460* :  Yes, it is a very ambitious plan by the African Union
*15:36.460- 15:39.840* :  and the Africa Centers for Disease Control, Africa CDC.
*15:40.620- 15:43.920* :  I remember I was in Zambia last month and early this month.
*15:44.520- 15:46.400* :  And I remember that directed general for Africa,
*15:46.400- 15:49.060* :  CDC saying if Africa is able to make its own vaccines
*15:49.060- 15:51.300* :  from scratch, it would be like our second independence.
*15:52.000- 15:55.580* :  The CDC has a goal for Africa to manufacture, to develop
*15:56.360- 16:00.100* :  and also to source for and also ultimately produce
*16:00.100- 16:04.000* :  60% of vaccines for the continent in the continent.
*16:04.000- 16:08.200* :  And to many people that this is a very ambitious goal,
*16:08.640- 16:10.600* :  given that at the moment it's just 1%,
*16:11.300- 16:13.200* :  do people really see that as viable?
*16:13.840- 16:15.340* :  Well, it's yes and no.
*16:15.760- 16:18.400* :  Yes, because there is hope if there is support
*16:18.560- 16:20.640* :  and that's why funding is very critical.
*16:20.640- 16:22.320* :  Partnerships is very critical.
*16:22.940- 16:26.640* :  And even access, lifting off patents is also very critical.
*16:27.320- 16:29.880* :  No, because 1% is still a fraction.
*16:30.640- 16:32.420* :  And there is a very long way to go.
*16:33.120- 16:35.400* :  And what this funding is also help to do,
*16:35.400- 16:38.020* :  it's to just kickstart that ambitious goal.
*16:38.300- 16:41.180* :  What AVMA, that's this facility,
*16:41.180- 16:43.780* :  the Africa vaccine manufacturing accelerator,
*16:44.520- 16:45.320* :  hopes to achieve.
*16:45.800- 16:48.320* :  As if this funding is made available to manufacturers,
*16:48.880- 16:51.360* :  it can help also offset high startup costs
*16:51.920- 16:53.980* :  and also look at priorities for Africa
*16:54.460- 16:56.400* :  because most of the manufacturing plants
*16:56.400- 16:59.340* :  in the continent are only doing fill and finishing.
*16:59.980- 17:02.040* :  So they're not developing their own vaccines
*17:02.040- 17:03.640* :  from the what go, they're just filling
*17:03.640- 17:05.380* :  and finishing what is already there.
*17:05.940- 17:06.840* :  But this is a start.
*17:07.300- 17:09.380* :  So at the beginning of this ambitious plan,
*17:09.380- 17:12.920* :  once you have the facilities in the South African countries,
*17:13.220- 17:14.960* :  in December, Rwanda will be launching
*17:15.440- 17:17.680* :  a facility supported by Biontech.
*17:18.100- 17:19.420* :  So once this is set in motion,
*17:19.420- 17:22.540* :  you'll see more African countries having the facilities fast,
*17:23.280- 17:25.680* :  having the know how, having the technology,
*17:25.740- 17:29.700* :  before we get to developing our very own vaccines from scratch.
*17:30.260- 17:31.500* :  That was Dorker's Juan Gera.
*17:34.020- 17:34.600* :  Still to come.
*17:35.000- 17:36.980* :  The U.S. Senator has written a letter
*17:36.980- 17:39.440* :  to the Department of Agriculture in the United States
*17:39.440- 17:42.180* :  asking for an investigation into Chinese garlic.
*17:42.620- 17:44.340* :  So what are the concerns about it?
*17:44.560- 17:45.220* :  Find out later.

*18:57.500- 18:58.440* :  I believe in the curse.
*18:58.740- 19:00.180* :  Yeah, I think it's real.
*19:00.440- 19:01.820* :  Is it just superstition?
*19:02.200- 19:03.680* :  Or could there be more to it?
*19:03.680- 19:07.000* :  Sometimes I think there's something sinister going on.

*19:21.980- 19:24.040* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*19:24.740- 19:27.000* :  This year has seen a record number of migrants
*19:27.000- 19:29.420* :  entering the United States via Mexico
*19:29.420- 19:32.880* :  putting intense pressure on the Biden administration.
*19:33.440- 19:35.720* :  Republicans in the US Congress are linking the crisis
*19:35.720- 19:39.400* :  to the war in Ukraine by refusing to approve military aid to Kiev
*19:40.000- 19:41.760* :  unless the Democrats approve funds
*19:41.760- 19:43.640* :  to better police the southern border.
*19:43.940- 19:45.960* :  Our North America editor, Sarah Smith,
*19:45.960- 19:49.220* :  traveled to the US Mexico border and sent this report.
*19:50.080- 19:53.020* :  This is not what the US border patrol are used to.
*19:53.740- 19:56.140* :  Illegal migrants who have snuck into America
*19:56.760- 19:58.660* :  lining up to hand themselves in.
*20:01.220- 20:03.700* :  So many of them that the authorities are overwhelmed.
*20:04.740- 20:06.660* :  Hundreds of people are waiting for their chance
*20:06.840- 20:09.080* :  to formally request the asylum in America.
*20:09.700- 20:12.560* :  Right here in the shadow of the border fence,
*20:13.260- 20:16.800* :  there are hundreds of people in what you can't really call a camp
*20:16.800- 20:18.280* :  because there's almost nothing here.
*20:18.280- 20:20.800* :  There's a handful of tents, some tarpollons
*20:20.840- 20:23.480* :  that are actually tied to the border fence itself,
*20:24.420- 20:27.720* :  providing very little shelter for hundreds of people.
*20:28.360- 20:30.500* :  We followed the route, all the immigrants are following.
*20:30.740- 20:33.560* :  Navid and his wife traveled for 50 days to get here
*20:33.560- 20:34.160* :  from Afghanistan.
*20:35.060- 20:37.460* :  He says the journey through Central America was brutal.
*20:37.860- 20:40.400* :  They treated all the people, especially Asians.
*20:41.540- 20:43.280* :  I don't know how to say this like a dog,
*20:44.560- 20:46.840* :  but the moment we crossed the border,
*20:48.360- 20:49.120* :  we felt very different.
*20:50.280- 20:52.520* :  We felt safe and we do feel safe.
*20:53.140- 20:56.240* :  This crisis on the border is a huge political problem
*20:56.440- 20:59.260* :  for President Biden, threatening his chances of re-election
*20:59.860- 21:02.780* :  and even putting aid to Ukraine in jeopardy
*21:03.300- 21:07.140* :  because Republicans in Congress won't vote for more money for Ukraine
*21:07.720- 21:10.200* :  unless Joe Biden agrees to crack down hard
*21:10.220- 21:14.460* :  on illegal immigration and basically puts an end to scenes like this.
*21:17.900- 21:19.980* :  migrants are no longer allowed to claim asylum
*21:19.980- 21:22.240* :  if they turn up at official border crossings.
*21:22.820- 21:25.780* :  So thousands of asylum seekers are instead coming in illegally.
*21:26.560- 21:28.700* :  Undeterred by that infamous border wall.
*21:31.900- 21:34.760* :  Here in Hukumba, they slip through a gap between the wall
*21:34.760- 21:35.800* :  and a mountain range.
*21:36.660- 21:38.700* :  This small town that's known for its hot springs
*21:38.700- 21:42.160* :  has a population of just over 500 permanent residents
*21:42.820- 21:46.540* :  and they now see more than that coming across the border every day.
*21:51.400- 21:54.100* :  Maria Schuster owns the land that the migrants are camping on.
*21:55.120- 21:57.220* :  She's furious that her trees are being cut down,
*21:57.660- 21:59.000* :  migrants burdened them to keep warm
*21:59.560- 22:01.220* :  and that our lands now littered with trash.
*22:01.840- 22:05.280* :  What would you tell the government to do to sort out the crisis on the border?
*22:06.140- 22:08.100* :  Blast the border, send them back.
*22:08.640- 22:09.460* :  We don't know these people.
*22:13.420- 22:15.140* :  All these people have been told to stay here
*22:15.380- 22:18.220* :  and wait days for their turn to be processed by immigration.
*22:19.280- 22:21.660* :  The only food and water comes from local volunteers.
*22:24.820- 22:25.960* :  Oh my God.
*22:27.600- 22:30.520* :  Samuel Schultz worked in disaster relief in Asia for decades.
*22:31.180- 22:33.740* :  He's now spending his retirement trying to cope with the disaster
*22:33.740- 22:35.040* :  on his own doorstep.
*22:35.260- 22:37.800* :  I have been told by the border patrol that the only way
*22:37.800- 22:39.800* :  this is going to change is if we stop doing this
*22:39.800- 22:43.740* :  and then people start starving and being hurt in a second
*22:44.080- 22:47.000* :  and are then possibly die out here and that then it will change.
*22:47.340- 22:50.680* :  I take a year not about to stop feeding them in order to try
*22:50.700- 22:52.340* :  and get the authorities to take responsibility.
*22:53.220- 22:54.380* :  No, I'm not going to do that.
*22:54.380- 22:56.080* :  I mean, I just don't trust them to do it.
*22:57.100- 22:58.200* :  How can I concede?
*22:58.200- 22:59.700* :  What's seeing what you see around you?
*22:59.700- 23:01.100* :  How can you possibly trust them?
*23:04.140- 23:07.440* :  It's very unusual to see scenes like this inside America
*23:08.100- 23:10.260* :  families with children forced to sleep in the open.
*23:10.880- 23:12.740* :  It's a symptom of the border crisis
*23:13.460- 23:15.500* :  and it will also increase the political pressure
*23:15.500- 23:18.460* :  to tackle this growing immigration emergency.
*23:20.460- 23:23.240* :  That report by Sarah Smith and the US-Mexico border.
*23:24.820- 23:27.660* :  There are plenty of diplomatic rouse between Washington
*23:27.660- 23:29.260* :  and Beijing at the moment.
*23:29.260- 23:32.000* :  Copyright infringements, human rights issues,
*23:32.520- 23:33.820* :  and rouse over Taiwan.
*23:33.820- 23:36.960* :  Well, we can now add garlic to that list.
*23:36.960- 23:41.080* :  The US Senator Rick Scott has urged the Department of Commerce
*23:41.080- 23:43.980* :  to investigate the safety of garlic imported from China
*23:43.980- 23:46.820* :  over claims that it's being grown in human sewage
*23:47.140- 23:49.220* :  produced in unsanitary environments.
*23:49.300- 23:52.100* :  The United States is one of China's biggest markets
*23:52.540- 23:53.400* :  for the root vegetable.
*23:53.900- 23:56.280* :  I heard more from our Asia-Pacific editor, Mickey Brister.
*23:56.980- 24:00.360* :  The US Senator has written a letter to the Department of Agriculture
*24:00.380- 24:04.220* :  in the United States asking for an investigation into Chinese garlic.
*24:04.720- 24:08.220* :  And in this letter essentially lays out health concerns
*24:08.220- 24:09.520* :  about the way it's produced.
*24:10.000- 24:13.520* :  Specifically, what he says is it's grown in human feces,
*24:13.940- 24:15.900* :  euphemistically known as night soil,
*24:16.320- 24:19.620* :  and also it's then washed in bleach to make it look quieter.
*24:19.620- 24:23.860* :  So essentially what he's saying is just not safe for US consumers to eat.
*24:24.660- 24:28.240* :  Do you think there's genuine concern here about the safety issue?
*24:28.700- 24:32.640* :  Or is the US and this individual perhaps just trying to tarnish
*24:32.640- 24:34.140* :  the reputation of Chinese imports?
*24:34.880- 24:35.680* :  Yeah, it's a good question.
*24:35.680- 24:38.900* :  It's very difficult to get to the bottom of whether it's safe or not.
*24:38.900- 24:42.700* :  These kind of allegations have been round for quite some time.
*24:43.300- 24:47.340* :  The US government itself has done an investigation into agricultural products
*24:47.340- 24:50.440* :  from China and says they're mostly safe.
*24:51.080- 24:55.260* :  A Canadian university a couple of years ago also did its own assessment.
*24:56.180- 25:00.400* :  Mentioning Chinese grown garlic, it said it was largely safe.
*25:01.100- 25:06.120* :  So even though night soil is used still in Chinese agriculture,
*25:07.360- 25:10.020* :  it's thought the garlic there is generally safe.
*25:10.600- 25:15.040* :  We got to say as well, human waste is used all around the world really
*25:15.620- 25:19.520* :  and has been for many years and is safe if it's treated properly.
*25:19.520- 25:22.280* :  I think that's the important thing whether or not it's treated properly.
*25:22.520- 25:26.020* :  And should we view this perhaps in the context of the economic battles
*25:26.020- 25:30.320* :  and cultural battles to a certain extent that go on between Beijing and Washington?
*25:30.780- 25:33.340* :  Yeah, I think you can't look at it just in isolation.
*25:33.440- 25:35.620* :  This is not just about garlic.
*25:36.180- 25:41.200* :  President Trump launched a trade war with China and at that time he introduced a tariff
*25:41.600- 25:46.360* :  on Chinese garlic imports and that benefited US growers
*25:46.360- 25:50.100* :  because they then could sell more garlic to their home consumers.
*25:50.500- 25:52.660* :  So you've got to look at it in that context as well.
*25:53.200- 25:59.780* :  Banning or limiting imports of Chinese garlic into the United States helps US producers.
*26:00.400- 26:02.640* :  You also mentioned culturally there as well.
*26:03.100- 26:08.880* :  The United States at the moment is going through a period where they view China as a real enemy
*26:09.400- 26:14.000* :  on all kinds of things and just today for example new sanctions were brought against companies
*26:14.640- 26:19.460* :  thought to be using slave labor from Xinjiang, that's an area in China.
*26:19.460- 26:25.060* :  So certainly a lot of people are looking skeptically at what goes on in China.
*26:25.060- 26:29.580* :  I think we've got to see this attack by this senator in that context.
*26:30.580- 26:31.080* :  Mickey Bristol.
*26:32.180- 26:35.980* :  The International Olympic Committee says competitors from Russia and Belarus
*26:35.980- 26:40.700* :  will be allowed to take part in next year's Paris Games as neutrals.
*26:40.860- 26:45.640* :  But participants in the biggest Olympic sport athletics are unlikely to compete.
*26:46.080- 26:47.240* :  Alex Kapstik explains.
*26:47.960- 26:52.020* :  Sports federations get the final say and most have followed the IOC's lead.
*26:52.020- 26:56.480* :  But not all athletics has barred all Russian and Belarusian participants
*26:56.480- 27:01.980* :  and has shown no sign of deviating from that position while the war in Ukraine continues.
*27:02.880- 27:06.200* :  Before the announcement Ukraine sports minister had called on the IOC
*27:06.200- 27:12.020* :  to make a responsible decision which will not allow Russia to use sport for military propaganda
*27:12.600- 27:14.420* :  even if it's under a neutral flag.
*27:14.880- 27:15.700* :  Alex Kapstik.
*27:16.880- 27:22.720* :  The funeral has taken place in Ireland of the musician and Pogue's frontman Shane McGowan.
*27:22.820- 27:24.640* :  He died last week, aged 65.
*27:24.640- 27:28.300* :  Among those who attended the service in County Tipperary
*27:28.660- 27:32.800* :  was the Irish president Michael D. Higgins and the actor Johnny Depp.
*27:33.720- 27:38.680* :  Well at the mass Shane McGowan's sister said he had achieved his dream of following in the footsteps
*27:39.180- 27:41.580* :  of the great Irish lyricists and musicians.
*27:42.320- 27:47.720* :  She told mourners he did so with a heart and fire that was not dimmed by his passing.
*27:48.520- 27:51.440* :  From Dublin, our island correspondent, Sarrad Gervin reports.
*27:52.380- 27:56.600* :  For Shane McGowan, County Tipperary was the place he called home.
*27:57.140- 28:01.800* :  The time of Nina came to a standstill for what would be his final homecoming.
*28:02.900- 28:08.800* :  In a service fittingly filled with music, his friend Nick Keeve played the 1986 classic,
*28:08.800- 28:13.920* :  a really night and so whole, an ode to friends lost but not forgotten.
*28:16.460- 28:21.060* :  I've been loving you a long time.
*28:24.160- 28:26.440* :  There were tributes by other famous friends.
*28:26.620- 28:29.880* :  Sir Bob Galdoff and Johnny Depp both read prayers.
*28:29.880- 28:32.620* :  He too's bono sent a recorded reading.
*28:33.360- 28:36.300* :  As Shane McGowan's widow Victoria Mary Clark spoke,
*28:36.300- 28:41.000* :  Gifts were brought to the altar by former members of the Pogue's to represent his life.
*28:41.760- 28:45.580* :  A vinyl copy of a lead Zeppelin album, a Gaelic football shirt,
*28:46.100- 28:48.420* :  and a copy of the Crock of Gouldsbyck,
*28:48.420- 28:52.860* :  which is a collection of handwritten lyrics and unpublished writing by the singer.
*28:53.940- 28:57.680* :  This morning, thousands of fans lined the streets of Dublin.
*28:58.280- 29:02.600* :  As Shane McGowan's coffin was taken through the city on a horse-drawn carriage.
*29:03.240- 29:07.300* :  When it left, there were spontaneous sing-alongs of his biggest hits.
*29:07.820- 29:20.300* :  She in McGowan was described as a master of music and lyrics,
*29:20.680- 29:24.800* :  and this effect was visible as many members of the congregation swayed
*29:24.800- 29:29.600* :  as his most famous hit, the fairy tale of New York, wrongite.
*29:34.020- 29:35.500* :  That report was by Sarah Gervin.
*29:37.860- 29:38.800* :  And that's all from us for now,
*29:38.800- 29:41.740* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
