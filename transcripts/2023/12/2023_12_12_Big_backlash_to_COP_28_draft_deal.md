*01:40.000- 01:42.800* :  European and US delegates say the latest draft agreement
*01:42.800- 01:45.540* :  doesn't do enough to tackle global warming.

*02:10.220- 02:11.200* :  Also in the podcast,
*02:11.200- 02:14.140* :  the Ukrainian president criticizes US Republicans
*02:14.140- 02:16.280* :  for blocking a military aid request.
*02:17.080- 02:19.540* :  And why are we listening to more music than ever before?
*02:19.900- 02:21.280* :  It's things like commuting.
*02:21.280- 02:22.260* :  It's while we're working.
*02:22.260- 02:24.900* :  It's while we're cooking, eating, exercising.
*02:25.000- 02:27.280* :  There's so many different things in which music
*02:27.280- 02:28.620* :  can be part of our lives.
*02:34.400- 02:36.540* :  Limiting the rise in global temperatures
*02:36.540- 02:39.300* :  to one and a half degrees above pre-industrial levels
*02:39.300- 02:43.140* :  is only possible by stopping burning fossil fuels.
*02:43.360- 02:45.280* :  That was the message from the UN chief
*02:45.280- 02:48.840* :  to the COP28 climate summit in Dubai a few days ago.
*02:49.400- 02:50.340* :  And as the meeting progressed,
*02:50.340- 02:53.440* :  it looked like the world would finally agree to, quote,
*02:53.440- 02:55.620* :  phase out fossil fuels.
*02:56.460- 02:59.800* :  But that all changed on Monday when that phrase was dropped
*02:59.800- 03:01.860* :  from the latest draft agreement,
*03:01.860- 03:05.100* :  angering climate activists and many delegates at the meeting.
*03:05.700- 03:07.600* :  This was Samoa's Environment Minister,
*03:07.600- 03:10.680* :  Cedric Schuster, who represents small island states.
*03:11.340- 03:14.020* :  If we do not have strong mitigation outcomes at this COP,
*03:14.480- 03:17.860* :  then this will be the COP where 1.5 would have died.
*03:18.340- 03:19.880* :  We will not sign our gift certificate.
*03:20.360- 03:23.800* :  We cannot sign on ticks that does not have strong commitments
*03:24.380- 03:25.700* :  on phasing out fossil fuels.
*03:26.020- 03:27.840* :  We feel our voices are not being heard.
*03:28.180- 03:30.680* :  While it appears that several other parties
*03:30.680- 03:32.440* :  have enjoyed preferential treatments.
*03:33.200- 03:36.380* :  Well, US and European nations were also unhappy
*03:36.380- 03:37.560* :  with the latest text.
*03:38.060- 03:40.380* :  Canada's climate minister, Stephen Gilbo,
*03:40.380- 03:43.360* :  was strongly critical of major oil producing nations.
*03:43.820- 03:45.520* :  Because the reports in the fossil fuel language
*03:45.520- 03:47.240* :  are trying to block negotiations
*03:47.740- 03:48.820* :  and should about everything else.
*03:49.080- 03:49.920* :  They're unhelpful.
*03:49.920- 03:52.780* :  And for parts of the world, life threatening.
*03:53.320- 03:55.080* :  And I understand, like, we're the forecard
*03:55.080- 03:56.060* :  just oil and gas producer.
*03:56.060- 03:56.740* :  We get it.
*03:56.740- 03:57.720* :  It's complicated.
*03:57.720- 03:58.960* :  It's unnerving.
*03:59.100- 04:02.680* :  It creates uncertainty in parts of our country.
*04:02.680- 04:04.780* :  But it's not a reason not to do it.
*04:04.780- 04:06.500* :  And not to tackle this problem.
*04:06.860- 04:08.500* :  Even if we bury our heads in the sand,
*04:08.780- 04:09.880* :  it's still going to happen.
*04:10.320- 04:12.200* :  Our environment correspondent Matt McGraw
*04:12.200- 04:14.180* :  is at the summit in the UAE.
*04:14.180- 04:16.340* :  So what did he make of the latest draft agreements?
*04:16.900- 04:18.720* :  I think it's disappointing for many people
*04:18.720- 04:21.980* :  who've been here for several weeks now building up.
*04:21.980- 04:24.380* :  I suppose a head esteem that the conference
*04:24.380- 04:26.800* :  was going to lead to the end of the use of fossil fuels.
*04:27.380- 04:29.100* :  And I think the texts we've had up today
*04:29.100- 04:31.400* :  kind of give credence to that view.
*04:31.400- 04:33.940* :  They all talked about phasing out fossil fuels
*04:34.460- 04:36.520* :  until we got to today the crunch point
*04:36.520- 04:38.820* :  when the presidency put together all the texts
*04:39.000- 04:39.920* :  and put them on the table.
*04:40.400- 04:43.000* :  And all the mention of phasing out essentially had gone.
*04:43.660- 04:45.920* :  And in their place was a list of things
*04:45.920- 04:48.740* :  that countries could do, not compelled to do.
*04:49.240- 04:51.540* :  And I think what we've seen here in the immediate aftermath
*04:51.540- 04:53.520* :  of that text has been quite a backlash
*04:53.720- 04:55.120* :  and quite a lot of anger from countries,
*04:55.540- 04:56.940* :  particularly the richer developed ones
*04:56.940- 04:57.920* :  like the European Union.
*04:58.060- 05:02.000* :  Why has the phrase phasing out been dropped from this text?
*05:02.260- 05:04.960* :  I think it's been dropped because of substantial opposition
*05:04.960- 05:06.880* :  from major oil producing countries,
*05:06.880- 05:10.120* :  including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Bolivia,
*05:10.120- 05:12.040* :  who've all made their position very clear on this.
*05:12.060- 05:13.400* :  And I think from Russia as well,
*05:13.760- 05:15.520* :  who've all said, look, we are major oil producers.
*05:15.860- 05:18.620* :  There's no reasonable path of finance here
*05:18.620- 05:22.480* :  to compensate us for the loss of our major production revenue
*05:22.900- 05:24.840* :  and they're not going to go along with it.
*05:24.960- 05:26.520* :  And they've been focusing on the fact
*05:26.520- 05:28.020* :  that the Greenwich should talk about emissions
*05:28.020- 05:29.280* :  and not about fuels.
*05:29.920- 05:31.220* :  And they've been essentially opposed
*05:31.220- 05:33.240* :  to this since the cops started.
*05:33.800- 05:35.060* :  But this is where we've ended up.
*05:35.060- 05:37.220* :  But now the presidency here seems to have cited
*05:37.520- 05:39.860* :  with those people resisting this change.
*05:39.860- 05:43.300* :  And that's where the new text has left us at this point.
*05:43.600- 05:46.060* :  You mentioned there was a backlash over this text.
*05:46.140- 05:48.880* :  Could we still get a deal that does include
*05:48.880- 05:50.780* :  phasing out of fossil fuels?
*05:51.180- 05:52.280* :  I think it would be very difficult.
*05:52.280- 05:54.940* :  It's possible that we could have a new text tomorrow
*05:55.620- 05:57.460* :  and that the parties who are meeting this evening
*05:57.460- 05:59.960* :  and into the night here may be able to draft something
*05:59.960- 06:03.500* :  that the presidency agrees he may then be able to go to the Saudis
*06:03.500- 06:05.560* :  and others and say, what do you think of this?
*06:06.020- 06:08.000* :  There will certainly be a sense of one spit
*06:08.000- 06:09.220* :  and twice shy about this.
*06:09.320- 06:12.780* :  And so I think it's not particularly easy
*06:12.780- 06:15.200* :  to achieve a victory from this particular defeat.
*06:15.880- 06:18.440* :  But all, I think, is still to play for it
*06:18.440- 06:21.360* :  because these negotiations could drag on for a couple days yet.
*06:21.600- 06:23.980* :  And if it ends as it looks now,
*06:23.980- 06:26.640* :  what would that mean for the world and global warming?
*06:27.000- 06:29.320* :  I think it would be seen as pretty much a disaster
*06:29.320- 06:30.900* :  for attempts to rain in temperatures.
*06:31.560- 06:33.960* :  Scientists have said that the next four, five, six, seven years
*06:33.960- 06:36.740* :  are critical for those measures to rain in temperatures.
*06:37.360- 06:40.840* :  This meeting here was supposed to essentially put in place
*06:40.840- 06:44.460* :  a really strong plan to really get behind the fossil fuel argument
*06:44.940- 06:46.360* :  and it would have failed to do that.
*06:46.500- 06:47.960* :  But as I said, it's not over yet.
*06:48.500- 06:49.900* :  Matt McGraw in Dubai.
*06:51.000- 06:54.720* :  Now it's been the scourge of Polish liberals and the EU alike.
*06:54.720- 06:57.160* :  But after eight years, the populist law
*06:57.160- 07:00.500* :  and justice government is out of power in Poland.
*07:01.180- 07:03.120* :  Despite being the largest single party
*07:03.120- 07:04.700* :  after October's elections,
*07:04.700- 07:07.020* :  it couldn't put together a viable coalition
*07:07.060- 07:10.380* :  and on Monday lost a vote of confidence in parliament.
*07:11.040- 07:13.440* :  It paves the way for the return of Donald Tusk,
*07:13.480- 07:15.420* :  who was Prime Minister until 2014,
*07:16.040- 07:18.760* :  and later head of the European Union Council.
*07:19.400- 07:21.980* :  Our Eastern Europe Correspondent Sarah Rainsford
*07:21.980- 07:24.340* :  sent this report from the Polish capital Warsaw.
*07:25.160- 07:26.160* :  APPLAUSE
*07:28.340- 07:30.860* :  The rich years and years today in Warsaw
*07:31.420- 07:33.200* :  as politics hit the big screen.
*07:34.560- 07:35.960* :  As deputy's gathered in parliament
*07:35.960- 07:37.700* :  for a confidence vote in the government,
*07:37.700- 07:41.940* :  this crowd headed for the cinema to watch with buckets of popcorn.
*07:42.400- 07:44.100* :  I just saw that people want together
*07:44.620- 07:46.900* :  and I love to be a part of the civil society
*07:46.940- 07:48.520* :  and I love to be a part of a change.
*07:48.520- 07:52.280* :  So here we are watching government meeting in cinema,
*07:52.660- 07:54.200* :  which is really absurd, but the same time
*07:54.200- 07:55.900* :  I feel we're kind of making history here.
*07:59.620- 08:03.080* :  Prime Minister Mateusz Borobietski knew it was a vote he couldn't win.
*08:03.740- 08:05.580* :  His populist law and justice party
*08:05.580- 08:08.140* :  lost its majority in the elections in October.
*08:08.840- 08:10.400* :  But after eight years in power,
*08:10.620- 08:12.880* :  the government has been stringing out its departure.
*08:13.060- 08:14.440* :  What's up, I watch that it's going to change.
*08:14.700- 08:16.080* :  Now, it's all over.
*08:16.580- 08:18.760* :  And in the cinema, they chanted goodbye.
*08:18.760- 08:19.480* :  APPLAUSE
*08:23.400- 08:25.240* :  So Poland's preparing for the sequel,
*08:25.240- 08:27.440* :  the return of Donald Tusk,
*08:27.700- 08:29.680* :  the opposition leader, Rand Poland, before,
*08:29.680- 08:32.240* :  and now he's back promising change.
*08:33.080- 08:36.280* :  That includes ending years of fractious relations with Brussels.
*08:36.980- 08:39.900* :  The EU has been holding back billions of euros in funding
*08:39.900- 08:43.160* :  over reforms that it says threatened the rule of law.
*08:43.220- 08:46.520* :  Donald Tusk says he'd address that as a priority.
*08:47.500- 08:49.680* :  But major policy moves won't be easy.
*08:50.180- 08:54.340* :  His coalition is broad and the president has the power to veto laws.
*08:55.140- 08:57.860* :  But public expectations have changed a high.
*08:58.480- 09:01.020* :  And this audience won't want to be disappointed.
*09:02.060- 09:02.100* :  APPLAUSE
*09:03.960- 09:06.500* :  Sarah reigned to their reporting from Poland.
*09:07.720- 09:10.080* :  The Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky,
*09:10.080- 09:12.240* :  has begun a crucial visit to Washington
*09:12.240- 09:16.140* :  to try to drum up support for continued US military assistance
*09:16.780- 09:19.040* :  in the fate of growing opposition there.
*09:19.380- 09:22.060* :  Funding for Ukraine's battle against the Russian invaders
*09:22.480- 09:24.300* :  is set to run out at the end of the year.
*09:24.760- 09:26.460* :  And the White House request to renew it
*09:26.460- 09:28.000* :  has stalled in Congress.
*09:28.660- 09:31.120* :  Mr. Zelensky told an audience of military leaders
*09:31.120- 09:35.260* :  in the US that he hoped Kiev could still count on American support.
*09:35.960- 09:37.880* :  From Washington, his Barbara Plattasha.
*09:38.460- 09:39.900* :  Almost exactly one year ago,
*09:39.900- 09:42.480* :  Vladimir Zelensky got a standing ovation here
*09:42.480- 09:44.500* :  while addressing a joint session of Congress.
*09:45.340- 09:47.380* :  But since then, a growing number of Republicans
*09:47.380- 09:50.100* :  have started questioning America's billions of dollars
*09:50.100- 09:51.700* :  in military aid to Ukraine.
*09:52.600- 09:54.880* :  Now the money is running out, and President Biden
*09:54.880- 09:57.040* :  has failed to get Congress to approve more.
*09:57.680- 09:59.660* :  So he invited Mr. Zelensky to Washington
*09:59.660- 10:02.760* :  to help underscore just how critical that aid is.
*10:03.520- 10:05.560* :  In a speech at the National Defense University,
*10:05.560- 10:08.000* :  the Ukrainian president described his country
*10:08.000- 10:12.040* :  as the front line in a wider Russian war against global freedoms.
*10:13.040- 10:15.540* :  And he said the unresolved issues on Capitol Hill
*10:15.540- 10:18.160* :  were inspiring the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
*10:18.980- 10:21.600* :  Mr. Zelensky is expected to visit the White House tomorrow.
*10:22.180- 10:23.960* :  Barbara Plattasha in Washington.
*10:24.600- 10:27.280* :  While the war in Ukraine has fueled hostility
*10:27.280- 10:30.000* :  between Russia and many Western states,
*10:30.000- 10:33.020* :  Moscow continues to foster close relations
*10:33.600- 10:35.840* :  with various countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
*10:36.440- 10:38.780* :  In the impoverished Central African Republic,
*10:38.820- 10:42.560* :  many people celebrate the influence of Russia in security
*10:43.060- 10:44.280* :  as well as culture,
*10:44.920- 10:48.300* :  as the BBC's Yemissi at a GOK has been finding out.
*10:48.440- 10:57.540* :  It's Sunday morning in Bungie, and we're inside the only Russian Orthodox Church
*10:57.540- 10:58.960* :  in the Central African Republic.
*10:59.400- 11:01.180* :  Dozens of people are here to pray.
*11:01.620- 11:04.460* :  This modest church with wooden pews and an aluminium roof
*11:04.460- 11:07.180* :  is roughly 20 minutes away from the centre of the Capitol.
*11:07.780- 11:11.460* :  It opened in 2015, years before the arrival of Wagner forces.
*11:12.120- 11:16.120* :  But father Voya Marwa welcomes Russia's growing presence in his country.
*11:18.420- 11:21.680* :  Russia today is helping, contributing in terms of security
*11:22.300- 11:25.140* :  with our African president for the security of the Republic.
*11:25.940- 11:26.660* :  This is a good thing.
*11:27.360- 11:28.140* :  We love the Russians,
*11:28.200- 11:30.520* :  and we love Russian culture in the Central African Republic.
*11:31.020- 11:34.920* :  In 2017, President Tuodera asked Russia for urgent support
*11:34.920- 11:37.080* :  to fight powerful armed rebel groups.
*11:37.620- 11:39.920* :  They sent Wagner mercenaries who helped the government
*11:39.920- 11:41.880* :  win back large parts of the country.
*11:42.520- 11:44.860* :  Their actions have won the hearts of many Central Africans,
*11:44.940- 11:47.440* :  some of whom see them as saviors.
*11:48.040- 11:51.940* :  Here in Bungie, security situation builds relatively calm.
*11:52.200- 11:56.020* :  Now, a lot of people I've spoken to have said that this feeling of security
*11:56.020- 11:59.220* :  is a direct result of the presence of Russian soldiers.
*12:01.080- 12:02.960* :  This sentiment is now cast in stone.
*12:03.520- 12:07.180* :  An iron memorial depicting Russian soldiers shielding Central Africans
*12:07.760- 12:09.340* :  sits in the centre of Bungie.
*12:10.940- 12:15.620* :  At a local bar, patron sit on Africa Tillor.
*12:15.960- 12:18.340* :  A Russian beer made by a company linked to Wagner
*12:18.580- 12:20.000* :  according to local media report,
*12:20.500- 12:21.840* :  and sanctioned by the US.
*12:22.540- 12:25.160* :  It's been heavily promoted with billboards across the city.
*12:25.420- 12:29.400* :  It's a beer made by the Russians, and I like drinking it.
*12:29.760- 12:31.680* :  There's vodka and flavoured liquor too.
*12:32.220- 12:34.020* :  Then there's Radio Lengo Songo,
*12:34.020- 12:37.380* :  a radio station that's been accused of supporting Wagner's activities
*12:37.380- 12:40.980* :  in the country and engaging in widespread disinformation campaigns.
*12:41.560- 12:44.620* :  The station is also funded by a company linked to the Wagner group,
*12:44.620- 12:46.900* :  sanctioned by the US and the UK.
*12:48.780- 12:51.240* :  The most visible presence of Russians here in Bungie
*12:51.480- 12:52.800* :  is the Russian Cultural Centre.
*12:53.220- 12:56.680* :  Opened in 2021, it runs Russian language classes.
*12:57.260- 12:58.700* :  Apparently, there's even a cinema.
*12:59.500- 13:02.880* :  President Tuadera, who often surrounds himself with Wagner soldiers,
*13:03.360- 13:04.280* :  defends their presence.
*13:04.520- 13:10.940* :  On this 80% of the territory was occupied by armed groups.
*13:11.500- 13:15.420* :  Today, thanks to this cooperation, these figures are completely reversed.
*13:16.020- 13:18.300* :  Of course, we are still facing some challenges,
*13:18.880- 13:21.080* :  and we are training our defence forces.
*13:21.680- 13:23.200* :  But Wagner's presence is controversial,
*13:23.200- 13:26.620* :  with the United Nations and various policy and media groups
*13:26.620- 13:29.040* :  accusing them of serious human rights abuses,
*13:29.660- 13:32.120* :  including torture, rape and killings.
*13:32.460- 13:35.720* :  And they've reportedly secured lucrative contracts for the country's
*13:35.780- 13:37.680* :  gold, diamond and timber reserves,
*13:38.240- 13:40.220* :  operating through a web of front companies.
*13:41.100- 13:44.660* :  In response, President Tuadera says an inquiry has been opened
*13:44.660- 13:46.300* :  into allegations of misconduct,
*13:46.300- 13:49.840* :  and that he's open to working with different partners around the world.
*13:50.720- 13:54.220* :  But critics like former Prime Minister Martin Ziegelle are not convinced.
*13:54.220- 13:58.200* :  They are totally free to do what they want to go,
*13:58.720- 14:01.600* :  where they want and to decide what they want to decide.
*14:01.740- 14:04.800* :  It's very dangerous because they are an economic field.
*14:05.340- 14:06.540* :  They are in security field.
*14:07.000- 14:08.320* :  They are in political field.
*14:08.680- 14:11.180* :  And now they are leading, in fact, the country.
*14:11.540- 14:14.800* :  Back at the Russian Orthodox Church,
*14:14.800- 14:18.220* :  Father Voyamawa hopes his community will grow.
*14:19.020- 14:20.240* :  Don't call it this orthodox.
*14:20.740- 14:22.840* :  In the Orthodox Church, there are no borders.
*14:23.560- 14:25.800* :  So, with time, and if God gives this blessing,
*14:26.360- 14:28.540* :  then we have plans to build large temples,
*14:29.220- 14:31.920* :  large Orthodox churches, throughout CER,
*14:33.080- 14:33.920* :  particularly in Bangi,
*14:34.320- 14:37.180* :  but also in the other provinces of the Central African Republic.
*14:42.860- 14:46.900* :  A report from the Central African Republic by Yemisee Adegouke.
*14:47.800- 14:50.920* :  They may be seen as a curtain razor for the Oscars,
*14:50.920- 14:55.840* :  but the Golden Globes film and TV Awards have recently been rocked by diversity routes
*14:56.340- 14:58.220* :  and a lack of interest from broadcasters.
*14:58.640- 15:01.200* :  They have since been revamped and, on Monday,
*15:01.200- 15:04.480* :  we found out the nominations ahead of the ceremony in January.
*15:05.060- 15:09.140* :  Barbie and Oppenheimer led the way with 9 and 8 respectively.
*15:10.260- 15:11.220* :  And I know what it means.
*15:13.520- 15:15.020* :  If the Nazis ever born.
*15:18.820- 15:20.180* :  They have a 12-month head start.
*15:20.560- 15:22.400* :  18. How could you possibly know that?
*15:22.700- 15:23.040* :  Hey Barbie.
*15:25.140- 15:26.080* :  Can I come to your house today?
*15:26.760- 15:26.920* :  Sure.
*15:27.840- 15:28.860* :  I don't know anything they planned.
*15:28.940- 15:30.940* :  Just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies
*15:34.340- 15:34.960* :  and plan choreography and a bespoke song.
*15:34.960- 15:36.000* :  You should stop by.
*15:39.840- 15:41.280* :  Well, I have more about the nominations
*15:41.280- 15:43.760* :  from the arts journalist Vincent Downe,
*15:44.020- 15:46.840* :  but first I asked him if the Globes were still relevant.
*15:47.360- 15:50.160* :  It's not long since the Globes faced a real crisis.
*15:50.160- 15:52.700* :  They were the creation of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,
*15:52.700- 15:55.280* :  a small self-selecting group of journalists
*15:55.280- 15:57.040* :  who covered Hollywood for non-US outlets.
*15:57.540- 15:59.460* :  For as long as I can remember, people always said,
*15:59.460- 16:00.080* :  this is mad.
*16:00.080- 16:02.200* :  You have around 90 totally obscure journalists
*16:02.200- 16:03.700* :  who call the shots on this award scheme,
*16:04.020- 16:07.180* :  second only in influence to the Oscars in 2021
*16:07.180- 16:09.340* :  with that going into every detail of a whole thing
*16:09.340- 16:12.540* :  basically imploded because of anger at the HFPA's
*16:12.640- 16:14.480* :  total lack of diversity in membership.
*16:14.860- 16:17.580* :  So now it's owned and run by Dick Clark Productions
*16:18.040- 16:19.680* :  and it's now on a new network in the US,
*16:19.680- 16:20.840* :  which is important in America.
*16:21.100- 16:22.980* :  The CBS, rather than NBC,
*16:22.980- 16:26.120* :  the Globes are looking for a total reboot this time.
*16:26.360- 16:29.520* :  No surprise to see Barbie and Oppenheimer doing well.
*16:29.980- 16:30.900* :  Who else leaps outy?
*16:31.520- 16:33.380* :  No, I've actually all got a bit tired earlier
*16:33.640- 16:35.220* :  in the year of the movie industry telling us
*16:35.220- 16:36.940* :  we had to go and see Barbieheimer,
*16:37.220- 16:38.380* :  which of course most of us did,
*16:38.600- 16:41.400* :  and don't forget they could win best picture both of them
*16:41.400- 16:43.620* :  because the Globes have separate categories for drama
*16:44.020- 16:45.680* :  and for musical stroke comedy.
*16:46.000- 16:48.260* :  The latter category will surely go to Barbie.
*16:48.660- 16:49.760* :  Oppenheimer, I would say,
*16:49.760- 16:51.540* :  has much more competition as drama
*16:51.540- 16:54.800* :  from killers of the flower, moon, that got seven nominations.
*16:54.800- 16:56.420* :  And a couple of outsiders,
*16:56.420- 16:59.100* :  such as the South Korean film past times,
*16:59.440- 17:01.140* :  in a mixture of English and Korean,
*17:01.140- 17:03.660* :  it has four nominations including Best Drama
*17:03.660- 17:05.300* :  and Best Director for Sedine Song.
*17:05.300- 17:08.380* :  It's a story of lost love rediscovered
*17:08.580- 17:10.440* :  and of the complexities which follow.
*17:11.660- 17:13.260* :  There is a word in Korean.
*17:14.660- 17:18.540* :  Inion, it means providence or fate.
*17:19.340- 17:20.000* :  You believe in that?
*17:21.000- 17:23.760* :  That's just something Korean say to seduce them.
*17:28.040- 17:29.640* :  Well, the makers of past lives
*17:29.900- 17:31.380* :  will be pleased for nominations.
*17:31.380- 17:33.280* :  Will anyone be disappointed, though?
*17:33.420- 17:35.420* :  I think we should say that the Oscar nominations
*17:35.420- 17:36.860* :  on the 23rd of January,
*17:37.680- 17:39.920* :  they're far more important than the Golden Globes.
*17:40.180- 17:42.920* :  We'll have to see how important the Globes now are.
*17:43.360- 17:44.840* :  The landscape has changed, definitely.
*17:44.840- 17:46.700* :  In terms of films which might have done better,
*17:47.220- 17:49.820* :  Wonka, not there as best comedy or musical,
*17:49.820- 17:51.760* :  although Timothy Chalamet was nominated
*17:51.760- 17:53.200* :  for Best Actor for Wonka,
*17:53.560- 17:55.540* :  and Sir Ridley Scott's big film Napoleon
*17:55.920- 17:57.920* :  seems to have met its Golden Globes Waterloo
*17:57.920- 17:59.140* :  and basically got nowhere.
*17:59.860- 18:01.920* :  Also, TV and streaming,
*18:01.920- 18:04.300* :  tell us about the nominations in that area.
*18:04.660- 18:06.320* :  Absolutely, inevitably, the drama.
*18:06.320- 18:08.340* :  Succession, which so many people love,
*18:08.340- 18:11.340* :  took nine nominations for HBO in its final run.
*18:11.760- 18:13.720* :  The very quirky only murders in the building
*18:13.720- 18:15.780* :  with Steve Martin that had five for Hulu
*18:16.160- 18:18.420* :  as did the bear Netflix as a whole
*18:18.420- 18:20.320* :  over the entire span of the Globes
*18:20.320- 18:21.420* :  has 28 nominations.
*18:21.860- 18:23.120* :  A big organisation these days.
*18:23.460- 18:24.500* :  Part of this year's reforms
*18:24.780- 18:27.860* :  is that categories now have six nominations no longer five.
*18:27.860- 18:30.720* :  The hope is that all that might improve diversity
*18:30.720- 18:33.480* :  among winners as voted for by what's still, you know,
*18:33.480- 18:35.560* :  a fairly small electorate, Olli,
*18:35.560- 18:36.440* :  of only about a hundred.
*18:36.680- 18:39.780* :  The Oscars are now heading towards 10,000 voters,
*18:40.160- 18:42.240* :  so they're a much bigger deal.
*18:42.720- 18:44.260* :  Arts journalist Vincent Dowd.
*18:46.840- 18:48.900* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast.
*18:49.600- 18:52.480* :  It is a massive thing for the sport of baseball,
*18:52.480- 18:54.140* :  for Japanese baseball,
*18:54.140- 18:56.080* :  and for Japanese sports as a whole.
*18:56.420- 18:57.840* :  The Japanese baseball star,
*18:57.840- 19:00.420* :  who signed the biggest contract in the sports history.
*19:09.540- 19:11.860* :  As Israel's ground offensive in Gaza
*19:11.860- 19:13.800* :  grinds remorselously on,
*19:14.040- 19:15.920* :  Hamas has threatened that no hostages
*19:15.920- 19:17.820* :  will leave the territory alive
*19:18.540- 19:20.160* :  except through a prisoner exchange.
*19:20.940- 19:22.880* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*19:22.880- 19:25.280* :  says dozens of Hamas militants have surrendered.
*19:25.860- 19:26.520* :  It was, he said,
*19:26.720- 19:28.440* :  the beginning of the end for the group.
*19:28.900- 19:30.960* :  Hugo Bachega sent this report from Jerusalem.
*19:35.460- 19:36.920* :  At the NASA Hospital in Hanyunis,
*19:36.920- 19:39.920* :  the rush to save lives after Israeli attacks,
*19:40.580- 19:41.820* :  this it is new routine.
*19:42.960- 19:45.580* :  Israeli tanks are slowly advancing from the east
*19:46.140- 19:48.780* :  while residents in central areas are being told to evacuate.
*19:49.400- 19:50.820* :  Many, not for the first time.
*19:51.740- 19:53.880* :  In northern Gaza, fierce fighting continues
*19:53.880- 19:55.720* :  in Jabalya and Shijaya.
*19:56.480- 19:58.560* :  Across the territory, eight agencies say
*19:58.860- 20:00.760* :  public order is disintegrating
*20:01.120- 20:03.740* :  as hunger spreads and desperation gets hold.
*20:04.580- 20:08.540* :  Lina Shakura is sheltering in central Gaza after fleeing the north.
*20:11.940- 20:14.700* :  I wake up every day as if I'm living in a nightmare,
*20:15.360- 20:17.760* :  remembering that we are still at war
*20:18.000- 20:19.260* :  and people are starving.
*20:19.260- 20:22.460* :  It's searching to be displaced from your house
*20:22.600- 20:23.600* :  and find no food.
*20:24.060- 20:25.540* :  Why are we guilty of this?
*20:25.900- 20:26.840* :  What have we done?
*20:27.260- 20:28.460* :  We are innocent civilians.
*20:28.460- 20:30.480* :  We are a family of five members.
*20:30.480- 20:33.380* :  But now, me and my family are sitting
*20:33.380- 20:35.800* :  with 40 individuals in one room
*20:36.400- 20:39.380* :  and have all the windows open because of the bombing.
*20:40.120- 20:41.120* :  As the war continues,
*20:41.540- 20:43.520* :  Israel is under international pressure
*20:43.520- 20:45.140* :  to do more to protect civilians.
*20:45.980- 20:47.520* :  But pressure is mounting at home, too,
*20:48.020- 20:49.760* :  for the release of the Israeli hostages
*20:50.040- 20:51.120* :  who remain in Gaza.
*20:51.720- 20:53.620* :  Every minute in captivity was like
*20:53.620- 20:56.720* :  Russian relax, says Sharon Alonikuno,
*20:57.140- 20:59.680* :  who was freed with her 23-year-old daughters.
*21:00.420- 21:02.300* :  Her husband remains in captivity.
*21:02.900- 21:05.260* :  Not enough is being done in order
*21:06.140- 21:08.580* :  to free the hostages from the Gaza Strip.
*21:08.800- 21:11.680* :  There are 138 people who are suffering inside
*21:12.140- 21:13.060* :  and they need to be out.
*21:13.840- 21:15.880* :  In a new warning, a Hamas spokesman said
*21:16.320- 21:18.280* :  no hostages would leave Gaza alive
*21:18.720- 21:20.840* :  unless Israel met the group's demands
*21:20.840- 21:22.160* :  for prisoner exchanges.
*21:23.140- 21:25.920* :  In Israeli officials said this was psychological terrorism
*21:25.920- 21:28.580* :  and that the only way to free the captives
*21:28.860- 21:31.240* :  was to put military pressure on Hamas.
*21:31.620- 21:33.300* :  Hugo Bicega in Jerusalem.
*21:34.640- 21:36.800* :  Do you remember the chaos over Brexit
*21:36.800- 21:38.920* :  as the British government tried and failed
*21:38.920- 21:40.820* :  to get its plans through Parliament,
*21:40.820- 21:42.460* :  thanks in part, to opposition
*21:42.460- 21:44.480* :  from its own conservative MPs?
*21:45.000- 21:46.880* :  Well, it seems those internal divisions
*21:47.100- 21:48.440* :  may be resurfacing
*21:48.440- 21:51.920* :  and it could spell trouble for the Prime Minister Rishisunak.
*21:52.420- 21:54.740* :  Later on Tuesday, he faces an important vote
*21:54.740- 21:56.960* :  on one of his key policies, immigration,
*21:56.960- 21:59.320* :  and an emergency law that he hopes
*21:59.320- 22:02.100* :  would allow him to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.
*22:02.840- 22:04.920* :  Some of his MPs have already said
*22:04.920- 22:06.040* :  they will vote against it.
*22:06.160- 22:08.440* :  I asked our political correspondent Rob Watson
*22:08.440- 22:11.180* :  why this Rwanda bill is so divisive.
*22:11.620- 22:13.880* :  Well, I think you set it up very nicely, Oliver,
*22:13.880- 22:15.340* :  by relating it to Brexit
*22:15.340- 22:18.480* :  because in a way, it's a continuation of those wars
*22:18.480- 22:21.700* :  in the sense that those who want this policy
*22:21.700- 22:24.800* :  to go further, they were hardliners on Brexit.
*22:24.840- 22:27.860* :  And for them, it's all about sovereignty, security,
*22:28.380- 22:28.920* :  and populism.
*22:28.980- 22:31.800* :  They think what people really want is for Britain
*22:31.860- 22:34.680* :  to be able to send asylum seekers to Rwanda
*22:34.680- 22:37.300* :  and that what really matters more than anything else is
*22:37.680- 22:39.660* :  British sovereignty, not international law
*22:39.660- 22:41.620* :  and the security of its borders.
*22:42.340- 22:44.260* :  That view encompasses several groups
*22:44.260- 22:46.420* :  on the right of the governing Conservative Party
*22:46.420- 22:49.260* :  and on the other side, those more in the centre
*22:49.260- 22:52.560* :  or those Conservatives who didn't really like Brexit very much
*22:53.220- 22:56.160* :  and who feel all this emphasis on sovereignty, security,
*22:56.160- 22:59.640* :  and populism, damages Britain's reputation
*22:59.700- 23:01.460* :  in the eyes of the outside world.
*23:01.860- 23:05.260* :  And I mean, how threatened is Rishi Sunack-Bial?
*23:05.720- 23:06.580* :  Oh, he's very threatened.
*23:06.660- 23:09.740* :  I know repeatedly on the newsroom programme, Oliver,
*23:10.160- 23:12.500* :  we talk about Britain's got a political crisis,
*23:12.500- 23:13.820* :  its leader is in trouble.
*23:14.400- 23:16.800* :  Again, it is a continuation, but this is real
*23:16.800- 23:20.540* :  because Rishi Sunack, some might say very unwisely,
*23:20.540- 23:22.680* :  has made this a flagship policy,
*23:22.680- 23:26.840* :  the idea of being able to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.
*23:26.840- 23:29.600* :  So he's really stuck his neck out on this.
*23:29.660- 23:33.780* :  But it's very hard to see how, even if he can survive a vote tomorrow,
*23:33.780- 23:36.720* :  it's difficult to see how he can construct a policy
*23:36.720- 23:39.540* :  that would work and that would keep both those wings
*23:39.920- 23:40.900* :  of his party happy.
*23:40.900- 23:43.540* :  So you've got all sorts of people wandering around
*23:43.540- 23:45.360* :  where I am here in Westminster thinking,
*23:45.360- 23:48.500* :  how on earth did he get himself into this mess?
*23:48.860- 23:51.320* :  And there's even been talk of things being so bad.
*23:51.320- 23:54.920* :  One Conservative MP said to me that he thought that the party was finished.
*23:54.940- 23:56.340* :  It was poisonous.
*23:57.000- 23:58.240* :  Everything was so angry.
*23:58.240- 24:01.500* :  It was very difficult to see how you could keep the show on the road.
*24:01.540- 24:04.600* :  Now that may be a bit over the top, but there's no doubt
*24:04.600- 24:07.340* :  that Mr. Sunack is really, really up against it.
*24:07.480- 24:10.480* :  Yeah, there was even some talk that the party might try
*24:10.480- 24:11.880* :  and get rid of Rishi Sunack,
*24:11.940- 24:13.540* :  but surely that couldn't happen again.
*24:14.040- 24:15.260* :  Anything could happen, all right?
*24:15.260- 24:18.060* :  I mean, you've been watching these last six or seven years.
*24:18.060- 24:21.560* :  The Conservatives have had five Prime Minister since 2010,
*24:22.040- 24:23.180* :  since they've been in power.
*24:23.480- 24:26.760* :  And things really are so fractious inside the governing party
*24:26.760- 24:28.920* :  that you really, really couldn't rule that out.
*24:28.920- 24:30.340* :  You couldn't rule anything out, Oliver.
*24:30.620- 24:33.080* :  Our political correspondent, Rob Watson, in Westminster.
*24:34.140- 24:37.380* :  Football matches in Greece will be played behind closed doors
*24:37.380- 24:40.460* :  for the next two months as the government tries to clamp down
*24:40.460- 24:41.780* :  on fan violence.
*24:42.500- 24:45.240* :  The ban on spectators in stadiums could also be applied
*24:45.240- 24:47.420* :  to European matches in Greece.
*24:47.480- 24:50.520* :  I heard more from our sports news correspondent, Alex Capstick.
*24:51.140- 24:54.580* :  Well, this is the latest attempted crackdown by the Greek authorities.
*24:55.420- 24:58.900* :  After years, we're really of trying to curb fan violence in the game.
*24:58.900- 25:02.920* :  It's very, very common for there to be running battles on the streets
*25:02.920- 25:07.840* :  before and after games in Greek sports, but especially in football.
*25:08.040- 25:10.380* :  You know, people have died in August this year.
*25:10.380- 25:14.820* :  A fan of Ike Athens was killed during fights against fans
*25:14.900- 25:17.620* :  from Dynamo Zagreb, the Croatian side.
*25:17.640- 25:20.840* :  And then in August last year, a 19-year-old he was killed,
*25:20.840- 25:25.160* :  a fan of Pagthesonica again in a battle with rival fans.
*25:25.620- 25:27.700* :  And then what appears to have been the tipping point
*25:27.700- 25:30.560* :  to this incident last week in Athens.
*25:30.560- 25:34.740* :  It was a volleyball match between Olympiakos and Panathonikos.
*25:35.400- 25:36.760* :  And there was a riot outside.
*25:36.760- 25:40.640* :  It's believed the riot was started by fans of the soccer clubs
*25:40.660- 25:41.600* :  of the same name.
*25:41.600- 25:44.920* :  They owned the volleyball team and a basketball team as well as a common increase.
*25:44.920- 25:48.500* :  And during this brawl, a police officer was critically injured
*25:48.500- 25:50.100* :  when he was hit by a flare.
*25:50.100- 25:53.000* :  And this riot involved hundreds and hundreds of fans.
*25:53.480- 25:56.860* :  Games in the super league, that's the top division of Greek football.
*25:56.860- 25:58.160* :  They were canceled at the weekend.
*25:58.160- 26:02.920* :  And the government has made this announcement to ban all fans from the stadiums.
*26:03.120- 26:06.340* :  It's all top flight domestic games as 14 clubs in that top flight.
*26:06.940- 26:11.640* :  They will be played without any fans up until February 12th.
*26:11.640- 26:14.220* :  Now it could also affect European competitions.
*26:14.840- 26:17.460* :  They're going to look at that on a case by case basis.
*26:17.460- 26:20.420* :  At least measures could last beyond February 12th.
*26:20.460- 26:22.500* :  The government have asked the clubs to take action
*26:22.500- 26:26.480* :  and part of that action is to install electronic surveillance
*26:26.480- 26:30.460* :  which will help identify the fans that come in to the stadium.
*26:31.140- 26:33.600* :  Violence amongst fans isn't unprecedented.
*26:33.600- 26:34.920* :  It happens in lots of countries.
*26:34.920- 26:38.880* :  But it certainly has been very extreme in Greece and in other countries.
*26:38.880- 26:39.900* :  But especially Greece.
*26:39.900- 26:42.920* :  And that's why the government has been forced or well say they've been forced to act.
*26:43.500- 26:45.660* :  Our sports news correspondent Alex Capstick.
*26:46.460- 26:49.920* :  Staying with sport and the big news that the Japanese baseball star,
*26:49.920- 26:53.340* :  Shoei Otani, has joined the Los Angeles Dodgers.
*26:53.880- 26:59.920* :  The $700 million 10-year contract is the largest ever in US Major League Baseball.
*26:59.920- 27:03.640* :  And makes Otani one of the world's highest earning athletes.
*27:04.280- 27:08.680* :  The 29-year-old has been credited with transforming how baseball is played.
*27:08.680- 27:12.920* :  The Tokyo-based sports journalist Dan Olowitz spoke to James Reynolds
*27:12.920- 27:15.920* :  about the sensation that is Shoei Otani.
*27:16.340- 27:21.980* :  For a Japanese player to pull in a $700 million contract,
*27:21.980- 27:26.380* :  the largest in North American sports history,
*27:27.220- 27:30.140* :  it is a massive thing for the sport of baseball,
*27:30.140- 27:33.740* :  for Japanese baseball, and for Japanese sports as a whole.
*27:34.620- 27:38.340* :  What does he do that no one else does in baseball to get him all this money?
*27:38.560- 27:40.960* :  He's referred to as the two-way player.
*27:41.220- 27:43.880* :  He can both pitch and hit, but not only can he do that,
*27:43.960- 27:45.840* :  but he just does it so well.
*27:46.700- 27:49.400* :  It's like saying that Van Gogh was a talented painter.
*27:50.140- 27:54.340* :  If you look at his vats as a pitcher or a hitter,
*27:54.780- 28:00.500* :  and consider that he is in the top 1% tile of the sport in either category,
*28:00.540- 28:03.980* :  and then you realize that he's doing this in both at the same time.
*28:03.980- 28:09.740* :  It is unprecedented to the point where it's just impossible to find fair comparisons
*28:09.780- 28:11.280* :  because of how good he is.
*28:12.060- 28:16.100* :  He can probably go anywhere he wants now by private jet for the rest of his life,
*28:16.180- 28:19.500* :  but let's say he was to return to Tokyo and walk down the main streets.
*28:19.500- 28:20.800* :  What would be the reaction?
*28:21.040- 28:24.000* :  I'm not quite sure he would get out of the airport.
*28:24.680- 28:27.420* :  Right now, he is Cristiano Ronaldo.
*28:27.420- 28:31.840* :  He is Lionel Messi for the Americans listening in LeBron James,
*28:31.840- 28:33.480* :  Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan.
*28:33.540- 28:35.640* :  He is all that packed into one player.
*28:35.640- 28:40.740* :  I think he is right now the most important Japanese athlete who is currently competing
*28:40.740- 28:45.260* :  and maybe one of the most important Japanese athletes who has ever competed in professional sports.
*28:45.500- 28:51.380* :  Dan, do you get a sense of what he's like as an actual person beyond the incredible sporting talent?
*28:51.380- 28:55.140* :  It's really hard to say to be completely honest.
*28:55.140- 28:57.540* :  I think that he is a reserved person.
*28:57.540- 29:00.840* :  I think that that's honestly true of a lot of Japanese athletes.
*29:00.840- 29:09.280* :  The fact that he won't even reveal the name of his dog who showed up famously in his little MVP acceptance speech video
*29:09.640- 29:11.420* :  that went viral on Twitter recently.
*29:11.420- 29:18.540* :  You realize he's not necessarily a player who is consumed by, say, fashion.
*29:18.580- 29:20.780* :  He's not wearing super expensive watches.
*29:20.780- 29:26.180* :  He's not wearing the latest coat or he's not driving around in a flashy car.
*29:27.000- 29:32.560* :  He is just a man who is focused on being the best in the world at the sport that he plays.
*29:33.400- 29:36.220* :  He may make ships in the bottle during the off season for all we know.
*29:36.940- 29:42.280* :  To be completely honest, he's just as likely to be spending his time in the bad and cage work on his stands.
*29:42.600- 29:43.280* :  Does he have a nickname?
*29:43.760- 29:44.960* :  We tend to go with Showtime.
*29:44.960- 29:51.680* :  You will see that show up in headlines here on newspapers and you're going to see a lot of Showtime in the years to come.
*29:52.660- 29:54.660* :  Dan, all of it's talking to James Reynolds.
*29:56.060- 30:05.380* :  We're listening to more music than ever before and average of just under 21 hours a week according to a study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
*30:05.380- 30:09.960* :  It also found that we use an average of seven different ways to access our music.
*30:10.540- 30:12.280* :  David Price helped carry out the research.
*30:12.780- 30:15.320* :  People are actively interacting with music.
*30:15.320- 30:19.000* :  They are choosing the music that they want to listen to at any one time.
*30:19.000- 30:22.840* :  We ask people about what they were getting up to when they listen to music.
*30:22.840- 30:24.540* :  It's things like commuting.
*30:24.540- 30:25.520* :  It's while we're working.
*30:25.520- 30:28.160* :  It's while we're cooking, eating, exercising.
*30:28.160- 30:31.900* :  There's so many different things in which music can be part of our lives.
*30:32.520- 30:35.880* :  Our music correspondent Mark Savage has been studying the findings.
*30:36.460- 30:41.800* :  The story of the last ten years of the music industry is just how accessible music has become.
*30:42.500- 30:44.360* :  Streaming has been the big story there.
*30:44.360- 30:49.840* :  A huge library of almost every song ever recorded available on your phone or wherever you go.
*30:50.420- 30:54.040* :  But also music is starting to permeate other parts of culture.
*30:54.040- 30:56.320* :  There are concerts in video games now.
*30:56.660- 31:00.920* :  Since the pandemic has ended, live music has come back in a massive way.
*31:01.100- 31:03.800* :  People are still tracking their entire lives.
*31:04.140- 31:07.780* :  Sometimes, without even noticing it, you realize that music's on in the background.
*31:08.060- 31:11.920* :  But that kind of lean-in listening is what this study is talking about.
*31:11.920- 31:14.920* :  And the fact that we're listening to almost 30 hours of music a week.
*31:14.920- 31:16.420* :  That's a day and a half of your life.
*31:16.620- 31:18.820* :  We're not talking about incidental music.
*31:19.100- 31:19.900* :  Lean-in listening.
*31:19.960- 31:21.920* :  That means actively seeking out this kind of music.
*31:22.280- 31:23.300* :  That's absolutely right.
*31:23.440- 31:29.320* :  So 24% of all music listening is on a subscription audio streaming service.
*31:29.320- 31:34.740* :  Something like Spotify or Apple Music, where people have paid to have the music that they're playing.
*31:34.740- 31:38.440* :  Now, obviously, sometimes you're actively choosing which songs you listen to.
*31:38.440- 31:41.560* :  And other times you just let the algorithm decide.
*31:41.560- 31:45.900* :  Somebody said to me once, I just trust the algorithm and whatever it plays I'm happy with.
*31:46.040- 31:52.840* :  Which makes it a bit like radio, which is I think the second or third biggest way of listening to music still.
*31:52.840- 31:56.440* :  Even though radio audiences have been in decline for some time.
*31:56.540- 31:59.300* :  That is often the way that people discover new music.
*31:59.700- 32:00.840* :  We have video streaming.
*32:00.840- 32:06.880* :  So that's YouTube or Daily Motion anywhere where you might watch a music video or a video that's been soundtrack.
*32:07.500- 32:08.900* :  And TikTok is coming up there.
*32:09.340- 32:12.900* :  8% of music listening comes from short-form video apps like TikTok.
*32:12.900- 32:18.540* :  And of course, the big story of the last couple of years is how TikTok has been a driver of the music industry.
*32:18.540- 32:29.020* :  Helping songs go viral and often allowing artists who don't have the marketing muscle of a major record label to break through and score major hits on the global stage.
*32:29.440- 32:33.460* :  Are artists benefiting from this increase in listening hours?
*32:33.660- 32:41.600* :  As we've known for a long time, streaming services don't pay a huge amount of money to the artists at the lower end of the scale.
