*01:43.840- 01:49.200* :  I'm Rachel Wright, and in the early hours of Sunday, the 17th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:49.200- 01:58.640* :  The relatives of Israeli hostages demand a return to negotiations with Hamas after the army admits killing three captives who were waving a white flag.
*01:58.640- 02:04.640* :  A senior Roman Catholic official has been sentenced to five and a half years in jail for embezzlement.
*02:05.320- 02:11.680* :  One of the most influential figures in Boston over music, Carlos Lira, has died in Brazil age 90.
*02:14.580- 02:15.740* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:16.240- 02:24.540* :  This is the first time the Pakistani authorities have used what you properly call artificial rain or cloud-seeding method.
*02:25.140- 02:29.500* :  So the Pakistani city of Lahore tries to make it rain. We find out why.
*02:34.120- 02:44.120* :  Relatives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and Gaza have staged an emotionally charged rally in Tel Aviv to demand that the government do more to secure their freedom.
*02:44.800- 02:55.020* :  Many carried placards bearing large pictures of their loved ones. They said the current policy of using military force wasn't working and demanded the resumption of negotiations.
*02:55.880- 03:00.080* :  Ruby Chen's 19-year-old son was seized from the Nahar Az-Armi base.
*03:00.840- 03:17.940* :  The Israeli government needs to be active. They need to put an offer on the table, including prisoners with blood on their hands and put the best offer on the table to get the hostages back alive.
*03:21.840- 03:30.220* :  Earlier, the Israeli army revealed that three hostages who were mistakenly killed by soldiers on Friday were waving a white flag when they were shot.
*03:30.780- 03:40.640* :  At a news conference, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted that the military campaign would continue, but said Israel was working with Qatar and Egypt.
*03:41.120- 03:43.600* :  Mr. Netanyahu was speaking through her translator.
*03:44.480- 03:53.640* :  With all the terrible sadness, let me clarify that the military pressure is necessary both for bringing back the hostages and to achieve victory.
*03:53.640- 04:04.920* :  Without the military operation, we would not have been able to bring an outline that brought to the release of over 100 hostages and continued military pressure will bring to the release of all the hostages.
*04:05.360- 04:11.660* :  The assumption of entering negotiations is based on this pressure. Without this pressure, we have nothing.
*04:12.380- 04:19.360* :  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner is in Jerusalem and told me more about the demands of the relatives of the Israeli hostages.
*04:20.060- 04:32.100* :  They want the Israeli government to make a deal with Hamas in the same way as it did earlier in this conflict that saw the release of dozens of hostages unharmed, traumatized but unharmed largely.
*04:32.100- 04:44.780* :  They simply do not agree with the Israeli government's official policy that a military force is the only way to get Hamas to release these hostages or to force their release.
*04:44.780- 04:54.820* :  Because it is not working. There is only one hostage who has come out that way. That was Audim Megadish, who was a relatively junior Israeli IDF service woman.
*04:54.820- 05:03.680* :  Others have been murdered. Others have been killed in air strikes. And 129 approximately are still held captive and goodness knows where.
*05:03.680- 05:10.500* :  Israeli intelligence doesn't seem to know where they are. So the safest way is to get them out through a deal.
*05:10.920- 05:18.580* :  And is there any chance of Israel halting their campaigner? There are reports that the head of Mossad is due to meet the Qatari Prime Minister.
*05:19.260- 05:27.260* :  Well, that meeting, if it takes place, this is between David Barnet and Sheikh Mahal bin Al-Darrahman Al-Thani, who is the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
*05:27.260- 05:34.720* :  They've met before. They negotiated a deal before. Qatari, of course, being host to the ex-al-political wing of Hamas.
*05:35.360- 05:42.060* :  That would be probably the best hope. That's what, according to the hostage families, of getting some kind of a deal.
*05:42.060- 05:50.040* :  Because they are saying time is running out. And there's very emotional press conference that the relatives attended today in Tel Aviv.
*05:50.520- 05:57.100* :  One of them held up an hour glass with the sand running out, saying the time is running out to save our people.
*05:57.660- 06:11.480* :  And the fact that they've had this terrible blue-on-green as the military would call it where friendly forces shoot dead somebody on their own side is just an illustration of how dangerous it is to try and rescue hostages by force.
*06:11.480- 06:20.360* :  It very rarely comes out historically with good results. It's extremely dangerous. And the hostage relatives are saying we need another approach.
*06:20.360- 06:28.000* :  They're saying that this really government isn't listening to them. They're saying it's easier to get a meeting with President Biden than it is with their own cabinet.
*06:28.880- 06:37.080* :  Frank Gardner in Jerusalem. The war in Gaza has been deadly for journalists trying to cover the violence that has claimed more than 18,000 lives.
*06:37.080- 06:47.760* :  Since the Hamas attacks in Israel on the 7th of October, which claimed the lives of around 1,200 people, at least 64 reporters and media workers have been killed.
*06:48.460- 06:57.760* :  On Saturday, the funeral took place in Gaza of the Al-Jazeera cameraman, Samu Abu Dhaka, who was killed in an Israeli drone strike on a school on Friday.
*06:58.420- 07:05.180* :  The BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rashdi Abu Aluf, who's now in Istanbul, worked with Samu Abu Dhaka for many years.
*07:06.120- 07:15.460* :  We were in the same building for about 12 years working together, seeing him every day. He's such a nice guy, not only a good journalist but also good father.
*07:15.500- 07:23.360* :  And one of the best like camera operators in Gaza, all the time connected to the story and dedicated to the story.
*07:23.500- 07:33.840* :  In order to keep his family safe, he asked them a couple of years ago to leave Gaza to Europe, but he remained in Gaza doing his job until the last moment of his life.
*07:34.280- 07:43.560* :  When I left Gaza, the last day, I went to see my BBC colleague and we were operating from Nasser Hospital, all of the journalists.
*07:43.560- 07:46.940* :  Al-Jazeera tent was closed to our place where we operate.
*07:46.940- 07:54.440* :  So I saw him standing, he was raining, and he was holding his umbrella, he was smiling, and you know.
*07:57.940- 08:01.420* :  I couldn't speak any more about him, he's just a nice guy.
*08:02.440- 08:08.580* :  I wish I spent more time with him that day because I didn't know that it's going to be the last meeting with him.
*08:08.580- 08:19.920* :  I just say, look, I had the chance to leave and we will keep in touch and he was, as I was like, you know, waving my way out to the car and then to outside Gaza.
*08:19.920- 08:22.680* :  He was just waving his hand and keeping touch.
*08:22.720- 08:26.060* :  The whole journalists are in a state of shock, you know.
*08:26.060- 08:32.480* :  They don't know what to do anymore, about 64 journalists and cameramen were killed during that.
*08:32.480- 08:42.800* :  I think this is the highest number I have ever seen in a 70 days war anywhere and really very shocking news for the journalists.
*08:42.800- 08:47.000* :  They don't know what to do. They called me, many of them like, called me this morning.
*08:47.000- 08:50.840* :  And you know, communication is really difficult and bad in Gaza.
*08:50.840- 08:58.180* :  But the journalists, some of the journalists still have this Israeli SIM card where we can work and operate.
*08:58.180- 09:07.760* :  And it was really, they were really in a very bad mood, people inside and we as a journalist outside watching them in this war is really tragic.
*09:08.580- 09:14.300* :  The BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rusty Abu Alef, speaking about his friend, Samar Abu Dhaka.
*09:14.800- 09:26.820* :  Drone and missile attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea are jeopardizing the flow of global trade with four of the five biggest commercial shipping companies no longer allowing their vessels into the straits.
*09:27.320- 09:36.940* :  There have been almost daily attacks in the area by Iranian backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who say they're targeting ships that are Israeli or heading to Israel.
*09:37.520- 09:44.280* :  The US said it destroyed 14 drones on Saturday while a British Royal Navy warship knocked out another one.
*09:44.420- 09:47.040* :  Here's our business reporter Vivian Nunes.
*09:47.880- 10:04.120* :  The world's largest shipping firm MSC and the French line CMA CGM today joined MERSC and HAPAG Lloyd in ordering their ships to drop anchor in a safe part of the Red Sea or seek another route as the risk of attack from Houthi rebels in Yemen increases.
*10:04.940- 10:13.640* :  12% of global trade travels through the Red Sea to the Suez Canal and it's a key route for cargo ships shifting goods between Asia and Europe.
*10:14.040- 10:24.660* :  Yesterday, Houthi missile attacks caused fires on board two vessels and while no crew were injured, shipping analysts say the cost of ensuring ships in the region has soared.
*10:24.820- 10:31.520* :  Sue Tabalowski is from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport which represents companies concerned with supply chains.
*10:31.860- 10:40.760* :  It's security to the crew to the ship itself and also the insurance policies premiums are now going sky high if they can get the insurance at all.
*10:40.760- 10:47.260* :  So it's going to have serious implications on stock levels, on cost and the whole dynamics of supply chains.
*10:47.780- 10:59.420* :  MSC says some of its ships are already being re-rooted around the Cape of Good Hope, a journey that will add three and a half thousand nautical miles, causing delays and disrupting arrivals at ports.
*10:59.500- 11:05.160* :  The added crewing, fuel and insurance costs are all likely to be passed on to consumers.
*11:07.480- 11:14.880* :  There was a time when a senior Roman Catholic official Cardinal Angelo Betiu was considered a possible future Pope.
*11:15.480- 11:21.880* :  That is, until he was found guilty of a string of corruption charges which cost the Catholic church millions of dollars.
*11:22.480- 11:30.800* :  After a long-running trial at the Vatican's criminal court, the Cardinal has been jailed for five and a half years as our reporter Emily Brown explains.
*11:31.640- 11:39.760* :  It's being called Italy's trial of the century and that's because this is the most senior Vatican official ever to be charged with financial crimes.
*11:40.440- 11:47.220* :  The Vatican court has sentenced Italian Cardinal Angelo Betiu to five years and six months in jail.
*11:47.780- 11:54.840* :  The 75-year-old is a former adviser to Pope Francis and is the most senior clergyman to face a Vatican criminal court.
*11:54.840- 12:07.900* :  At the heart of the trial was a 350 million euro purchase of a property in London, bought with church money but it incurred a huge loss and ended up costing the Vatican tens of millions of euros.
*12:07.900- 12:19.120* :  The trial, which began more than two years ago, has shone a light on the Holy See's finances and has been seen widely as a test of Pope's Francis press for reform.
*12:19.920- 12:30.440* :  Just weeks before the trial, Pope Francis gave the Vatican's civilian court the power to trial Cardinals and bishops where previously they were judged by a court presided over by Cardinals.
*12:31.180- 12:38.060* :  Angelo Betiu abruptly resigned in September 2020 after being informed of an investigation against him.
*12:38.640- 12:51.000* :  Angelo Betiu and nine other defendants had strongly denied charges that included embezzlement and abuse of office and this brings an end to an historic trial of a once powerful Italian Cardinal.
*12:51.500- 12:59.440* :  Emily Brown. Now Winter in many of Asia's cities brings dangerous levels of smog and Pakistan cities are no exception.
*12:59.960- 13:07.880* :  So Lahore, a city of 11 million people, is trying something unusual to help reduce the toxic pollution. It's going to create rain.
*13:07.880- 13:12.540* :  For more on this, I spoke to our South Asia Regional Editor and Barassan Etherogen.
*13:13.200- 13:21.480* :  This is the first time the Pakistani authorities have used what you popularly call artificial rain or cloud-seeding methods.
*13:21.640- 13:28.040* :  So they got the help from the United Arab Emirates, which had sent the two planes with the necessary chemicals.
*13:28.500- 13:39.880* :  So basically they go up over the clouds and they spray different kinds of chemical salts like silver iodide to create condensation which forms the snowflakes.
*13:39.880- 13:45.540* :  Sometimes by the time they reach the ground it becomes water. So what they call as artificial rain.
*13:46.000- 14:04.900* :  Now in recent times you see many South Asian cities like Lahore, Delhi and other cities are facing this problem of toxic smog basically created due to diesel plumes from the vehicles and also factory smoke and also the farmers burning the crop residue after their harvest.
*14:04.900- 14:13.680* :  It happens widely in the Punjab province of both Pakistan and across the border in India. The Indian border is only about 25 kilometers from Lahore city.
*14:14.320- 14:23.380* :  So the level of this cancer-causing particles which goes through our lungs according to the official estimate it was declared as hazardous in Lahore city.
*14:23.380- 14:32.360* :  And that is why they tried this method to induce rain because even a modest rain can bring down the level of pollution and that is what they attempted today.
*14:32.500- 14:35.220* :  And the all-important question is has it worked?
*14:35.660- 14:52.980* :  Well according to the Catech, a trip minister of Punjab province, Mohsin Nakfi said the some parts of city had received light rain and what the officials are saying is that they have to wait till Saturday night or tomorrow morning to see the full impact of this practice.
*14:53.640- 14:59.940* :  Again they are making another attempt to show that they are doing something to bring down the pollution level.
*15:00.460- 15:04.480* :  You know the Lahore city has been facing this huge problem for weeks now.
*15:05.120- 15:16.220* :  They had tried to close schools, markets, businesses, even factories and during weekends so that the level of pollution can come down but not with much success actually.
*15:16.220- 15:20.480* :  So they are trying different methods and that is what even experts are saying.
*15:20.480- 15:27.220* :  These are very short term methods to bring down to bring rain to induce rain but you need to have a long term strategy.
*15:27.840- 15:33.080* :  How do you tackle pollution in a mega city like Lahore with 11 million residents?
*15:33.780- 15:36.040* :  So that has been a big debating point.
*15:36.580- 15:41.800* :  So Pakistan is now trying to see whether this can help to bring down the pollution in the city of Lahore.
*15:42.480- 15:45.680* :  Our South Asia Regional Editor, Ambarasan Etherogen.
*15:49.060- 15:49.700* :  Still to come.
*15:50.220- 15:53.580* :  Put your phone in your backpack in a pocket that is a little bit hard to get to.
*15:53.940- 16:02.620* :  Even just that small barrier will make you I think a lot less likely to pull your phone out and start using it when you are maybe faced with a slightly uncomfortable situation.
*16:03.140- 16:06.380* :  Surprisingly you might feel happier if you socialize.
*16:13.700- 16:19.960* :  Hey it's Ryan Reynolds owner and user of Mint Mobile and I am recording this message on my phone and literally on my mint phone.
*16:20.080- 16:26.320* :  Why? Because fancy recording studios cost money and if we spent money on things like that we couldn't offer you screaming deals.

*17:19.080- 17:24.860* :  County Mayo's Galic football team haven't won an all Ireland championship since 1951.
*17:25.160- 17:27.180* :  Mayo got the final so many times.
*17:27.240- 17:30.700* :  We get to start every year and we just can't get over the last step.
*17:30.840- 17:33.760* :  And tales of a priest's curse about.
*17:34.000- 17:35.780* :  There's a long kill worth excuses.
*17:35.960- 17:42.320* :  I put it down to the curse and the only explanation amazing sport stories investigates the curse of County Mayo.
*17:42.320- 17:48.360* :  I see it for stand listen now by searching for amazing sport stories wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:49.040- 17:52.180* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast now to South Africa.
*17:52.640- 17:58.420* :  The former president Jacob Zuma has launched a stinging attack on his successor, Cyril Ramaposa.
*17:58.900- 18:03.760* :  And has said he will not campaign for the African National Congress during next year's election.
*18:04.300- 18:08.200* :  Mr Zuma said the ANC could no longer be rescued from within.
*18:08.760- 18:11.180* :  His daughter, Duduzila, spoke on his behalf.
*18:11.720- 18:17.120* :  It has become clear that this organization is no longer the organization that we grew up knowing.
*18:17.120- 18:27.500* :  It is for this very reason that those of us who will never forsake or abandon the ANC feel it necessary that we undertake a process to rescue the ANC.
*18:30.440- 18:33.300* :  Bring it back to the people and its door its former glory.
*18:34.180- 18:40.340* :  81 year old Jacob Zuma was South African president between 2009 and 2018.
*18:40.380- 18:42.480* :  He's had a colorful past.
*18:42.480- 18:51.340* :  He was sentenced to 15 months in jail for contempt of court but managed to avoid serving most of his sentence because of overcrowding in the country's prison system.
*18:51.340- 19:01.220* :  Our correspondent in Johannesburg, Daniel D. Simone told me more about Mr Zuma's comments regarding the African National Congress and his successor, Cyril Ramaposa.
*19:01.860- 19:06.940* :  There was a lot of speculation with his South Africa that he might announce that he's leaving the ANC.
*19:07.520- 19:13.440* :  The statement today doesn't do that but he is highly critical of the ANC under Cyril Ramaposa.
*19:13.500- 19:19.860* :  He characterizes Mr Ramaposa as being a proxy for white capitalist interests.
*19:19.860- 19:38.860* :  He says the ANC which he says was once a glorious liberation movement is really a shadow of what it once was and that the current government is a failure and is letting down Black South Africans that Mr Ramaposa has declared war on many Black South Africans.
*19:38.860- 19:45.700* :  So he's saying that he will not vote for the ANC in the upcoming general election which is going to take place next year.
*19:46.320- 19:50.780* :  He's saying that he instead is going to vote for a new political party.
*19:50.780- 20:00.020* :  On Conto, we see this way which it was actually named after the now disbanded, long disbanded armed wing of the ANC.
*20:00.460- 20:06.480* :  That armed wing which was abbreviated to MK was something that Mr Zuma was part of.
*20:06.480- 20:14.720* :  He was a commander within MK. MK carried out bombings during its long battle against the apartheid government.
*20:14.720- 20:21.760* :  It was then disbanded in 1993 prior to the elections in 1994 that saw the ANC come to power.
*20:22.300- 20:31.420* :  So the fact that Jacob Zuma is naming this new party after what was a military wing of the ANC could be seen as quite incendiary.
*20:31.560- 20:39.020* :  He said today in the statement that the new people's war that begins today he said will involve a ballot, not bullets.
*20:39.860- 20:48.880* :  But his language about the ANC he's speaking about apartheid here are collaborators, sellouts, he's talking about enemies of the people.
*20:49.300- 20:51.560* :  So his language is very very strong.
*20:52.400- 20:56.440* :  And what effect do you think this will have on South African politics?
*20:57.040- 21:05.800* :  What's very interesting is the upcoming election will be the 30th anniversary next year of the ANC coming to power of Nelson Mandela becoming president of South Africa.
*21:06.460- 21:08.700* :  And the ANC has been in power since then.
*21:09.260- 21:17.180* :  But this upcoming election is widely viewed by many people as probably the most competitive election the ANC has faced since coming to power.
*21:17.180- 21:21.400* :  It's always held a majority in the national assembly.
*21:22.080- 21:30.960* :  There is a lot of speculation that it may not hold a majority after the upcoming election because there are other parties who are just enforcing support.
*21:31.640- 21:36.220* :  The current South African government faces multiple problems it's having to deal with.
*21:36.420- 21:43.180* :  There's an energy crisis in the country that sees power cuts, regular power cuts, crime is a major issue.
*21:43.720- 21:51.940* :  And there are longstanding issues around cronyism and corruption, allegations against the ANC that you'll hear widely where have you go in South Africa.
*21:52.540- 22:02.300* :  So that the advent of a new political party with the support of the last president but one will not probably be very welcome to the governing party.
*22:02.940- 22:10.960* :  Daniel de Simone in South Africa does sport have a role to play alongside the more obvious needs of shelter, food and health care.
*22:11.340- 22:14.820* :  In helping refugees settle into the country they've fled to.
*22:15.340- 22:25.240* :  A UN forum on refugees has highlighted the growing role that sports plays in helping them to recover from trauma, to integrate and to battle prejudice in their new home.
*22:25.240- 22:31.000* :  The International Olympic Committee has just pledged $45 million to help support the effort.
*22:31.600- 22:33.380* :  Jeanette Gillil reports from Geneva.
*22:34.100- 22:39.880* :  In the past decade the IOC has worked closely with the UNHCR to create a refugee Olympic team.
*22:40.640- 22:44.040* :  First in Rio, then Tokyo, and next year in Paris.
*22:44.280- 22:50.760* :  The IOC has praised Taekwondo for leading the way.
*22:51.380- 22:54.600* :  It set up a flagship academy at a refugee camp in Jordan.
*22:55.320- 23:00.200* :  Law of the knee from the Taekwondo Humanitarian Foundation explained how it came about.
*23:00.320- 23:07.180* :  It's all started in 2016 through the initiative of World Taekwondo President, Dr. Chu Wan Chu.
*23:07.720- 23:17.400* :  He made a commitment at the UNHCR in New York because he observed that unfortunately a lot of refugees were on their own in the refugee camps.
*23:17.840- 23:25.700* :  And that's something needed to be done to give them hope and dreams and bring them a new smile.
*23:30.480- 23:37.020* :  Now a hundred of the refugees at the Azraq camp have gained black belts and one of them is training for the Paris Olympics.
*23:39.240- 23:47.580* :  In Afghanistan, Khalida Papal had to challenge a deeply misogynistic culture to become a footballer before she even became a refugee.
*23:48.080- 23:51.020* :  She founded and then captained the Afghan women's football team.
*23:51.640- 23:56.100* :  And it was sport that helped her to rebuild her life after she fled the Taliban takeover.
*23:56.380- 24:03.660* :  I felt so lonely without network, new identity was toughest and what helped me was sport.
*24:03.660- 24:16.260* :  I used against sports in refugee centers to survive as a refugee to overcome through trauma and connect with other refugee women to create a sisterhood community
*24:16.300- 24:23.960* :  where we could share and express our feelings and to stay together share our moments and overcome the challenges.
*24:24.960- 24:35.720* :  Sport isn't just helping female refugees. The world's largest sports organisation for children and adults with intellectual disabilities is actively recruiting refugees to compete.
*24:36.480- 24:39.120* :  David Evangelista helps to run the special Olympics.
*24:39.120- 24:46.280* :  If you're a refugee on the move and you're in a host community, everything's new, you may or may not be accepted within your community.
*24:46.280- 24:51.620* :  Language is different, food is different, sometimes you're not a company, you don't have a lot of family around social network.
*24:52.780- 24:57.020* :  Imagine all of that and you have Down syndrome and you have autism.
*24:57.480- 25:02.720* :  Think of the social stigma. Think of the marginalization, the social isolation you would feel.
*25:03.120- 25:07.580* :  And that's why a movement like Special Olympics is so important. It's not just nice, it's urgent.
*25:08.160- 25:15.600* :  With unprecedented numbers of people displaced by conflict and persecution, the message from those taking part here is clear,
*25:16.180- 25:20.840* :  but the power of sport to help refugees has never been more important.
*25:21.920- 25:23.800* :  That report by Jeanette Gillil.
*25:24.420- 25:33.580* :  A new study by psychologists in Canada suggests that when we use our smartphones to avoid engaging with other people, we're actually making ourselves feel worse.
*25:33.580- 25:40.180* :  And the conclusion seems to be that if you find yourself reaching for your phone to avoid social interaction, don't.
*25:40.760- 25:42.500* :  Stephanie Prentice has more details.
*25:43.220- 25:47.200* :  This was a team from the University of British Columbia and their lead researcher.
*25:47.200- 25:52.620* :  He'd seen people in restaurants sat together but using their phones instead of chatting and he was intrigued.
*25:52.620- 25:58.800* :  So he got a team together and they took 400 strangers, split them into groups and they sort of tricked them.
*25:58.800- 26:02.380* :  They asked them to just wait together for the test they were eventually expecting.
*26:02.820- 26:07.900* :  Half had phones, half didn't and they were asked every five minutes how they were feeling.
*26:08.460- 26:16.040* :  Now the research team thought the people without the phones would enjoy the way more overall, but the ones with them would feel better short term.
*26:16.040- 26:21.520* :  And that's presumably because they'd be getting those instant dopamine hits from all the stimuli living inside there.
*26:22.000- 26:28.600* :  But actually, when the results were in, they concluded the phones didn't deliver any detectable benefits they said.
*26:28.600- 26:36.320* :  Another lead researcher, he's called Ryan Dwyer, he even advised people to create a barrier against their phone to feel happier.
*26:37.100- 26:40.500* :  Put your phone in your backpack in a pocket that's a little bit hard to get to.
*26:40.860- 26:49.460* :  Even just that small barrier will make you I think a lot less likely to pull your phone out and start using it when you're maybe faced with a slightly uncomfortable situation.
*26:49.500- 26:56.100* :  So rather than turning to your phone, you might be a little bit more likely to just strike up a conversation with the person who's right next to you.
*26:56.320- 27:02.280* :  Ryan Dwyer is absolutely right, according to other studies in this field, including this recent one from Harvard.
*27:02.720- 27:06.120* :  That suggests that there are interactions with what they called weak ties.
*27:06.120- 27:13.300* :  So that might be someone that you don't know that well as changing me on a bus, whatever has a significant impact on your daily happiness.
*27:13.880- 27:17.400* :  And what they called diversity of social portfolios.
*27:17.400- 27:24.060* :  So essentially talking to lots of different people, that leads to different types of support and enhanced well-being overall.
*27:25.260- 27:26.360* :  Stephanie Prentice.
*27:26.860- 27:33.640* :  We heard earlier about the efforts Pakistan is going to in order to try to reduce air pollution in the city of Lahore.
*27:34.100- 27:38.760* :  Well, there's been long extensive research about the effects of air pollution on our lungs.
*27:38.760- 27:43.380* :  But what's less well known is the impact these particles have on our brains.
*27:44.220- 27:50.980* :  Now, scientists at the University of Manchester and the north-west of England are carrying out experiments to redress that.
*27:51.520- 27:54.900* :  Our science editor Rebecca Morrell has been talking to the researchers.
*27:56.020- 28:00.260* :  What we are going to do is we are going to wear the mask seat here in this seat.
*28:00.460- 28:01.100* :  Thanks for an hour.
*28:02.380- 28:08.420* :  In a lab at Manchester University, volunteers are donning masks to breathe in lovels of polluted air.
*28:08.780- 28:16.340* :  They're being exposed to different kinds of fumes, diesel exhaust, wood smoke, cleaning products and cooking odors from frying a pork chop.
*28:17.020- 28:20.020* :  The aim is to find out how pollution is affecting the brain.
*28:20.620- 28:31.020* :  Researchers are collecting blood and other biological samples before and after the volunteers are exposed to each different pollutant, as well as monitoring the results of cognitive tests.
*28:31.580- 28:37.580* :  The aim hopes to discover which ones are having the biggest effect, as Professor Gordon McFiggins explains.
*28:37.580- 28:46.100* :  You could imagine that we find that wood burning is worse than diesel, is worse than cooking, for example.
*28:46.780- 28:53.980* :  This would then allow people to make lifestyle choices about their exposure to the different pollutants.
*28:54.380- 29:03.140* :  Moreover, it gives us a tool to be able to understand how people might better manage the risk associated with the different air pollutants.
*29:03.140- 29:08.620* :  The World Health Organization says that almost all of the global population, 99%,
*29:08.960- 29:13.120* :  are breathing in air that exceeds the WHO's limits for common air pollutants,
*29:13.420- 29:20.080* :  and the combined effects of outside and indoor air pollution contribute to 7 million premature deaths every year.
*29:20.560- 29:23.760* :  It will take several months to analyse the data from these experiments.
*29:23.820- 29:29.620* :  The results could mean we think differently about how our everyday activities affect the air we breathe.
*29:30.600- 29:31.380* :  Rebecca Moral
*29:32.140- 29:38.700* :  One of Brazil's most revered musicians, Carlos Lera, has died in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 90.
*29:39.260- 29:46.360* :  Lera was one of the pioneers of bossen over, a blend of traditional samba with elements of jazz and other musical genres.
*29:47.020- 29:52.880* :  He wrote some of the movement's most influential songs in the late 1950s and 60s, like this one.
*30:03.620- 30:09.820* :  I spoke to our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia and began by asking him what that song is about.
*30:10.560- 30:14.640* :  It's a beautiful song, all of the bossen over songs.
*30:14.640- 30:20.900* :  What they did is to mix traditional Brazilian samba that had a lot of African influence,
*30:20.900- 30:28.900* :  but removing, let's say, the percussion, the drums, and mixing with jazz influences in other arrangements.
*30:28.960- 30:32.780* :  Carlos Lera, I mean the song we heard was in the voice of Jean Gilberto,
*30:32.780- 30:38.680* :  who was the main creator of the beat, that beat of the bossen over in the late 50s and early 60s.
*30:39.360- 30:43.440* :  A person from middle class background, as many of the people in the bossen over,
*30:43.440- 30:49.440* :  just a very talented generation that happened to be in Rio listening to the same sort of music
*30:49.440- 30:57.440* :  and trying to create, to give a new taste, a new more urban vibe to the Brazilian traditional music.
*30:57.900- 31:05.480* :  He was a guitar player, very talented, and had partnerships songwriting with many of the bossen over singers there.
*31:05.480- 31:10.100* :  He was a very talented person, and also liked by everyone.
*31:10.160- 31:16.780* :  People said he was funny, he was enjoyable, he was a great character, died at the age of 90s in Rio, his hometown.
*31:17.340- 31:24.360* :  And presumably he took the music, the bossen over music to the world as well, became a Brazilian, became the center of it.
*31:24.480- 31:30.280* :  Yes, because he wrote songs for Jean Gilberto, for Jean Gilberto, he made his own career.
*31:30.900- 31:38.080* :  But some of his songs, like the influence of jazz, for example, they were played in a famous Carnegie Hall concert
*31:38.080- 31:40.540* :  when the bossen over went into the US.
*31:40.540- 31:47.460* :  Many other songs, I even heard a version of one of his songs sang by Brigitte Bardot in Portuguese at the time.
*31:47.940- 31:51.600* :  So because many people might not know how influential the bossen over is.
*31:51.600- 31:56.920* :  And Lobo Bobo was one of the songs that I really like him about, a foolish wolf chasing a woman.
*31:57.260- 31:59.440* :  Let's listen to the song.
*32:06.480- 32:13.700* :  Leonardo Rossho on the life of the Brazilian musician Carlos Lira, who has died in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 90.
*32:16.800- 32:21.340* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
