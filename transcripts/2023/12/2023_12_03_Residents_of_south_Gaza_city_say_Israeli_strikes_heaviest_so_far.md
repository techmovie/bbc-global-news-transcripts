*01:46.680- 01:50.100* :  Hello, this is the Global News podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:52.200- 01:56.840* :  I'm Robin Brandt, and in the early hours of Sunday 3rd of December, these are our main stories.
*01:56.840- 02:00.580* :  As Israel's renewed bombardment of Gaza continues,
*02:01.000- 02:06.240* :  the UN's children's agency has described the dropping of leaflets telling Palestinians to go
*02:06.240- 02:07.860* :  to safe areas as cynical.
*02:08.580- 02:13.280* :  The UN's annual climate summit has heard further pledges from energy firms and governments
*02:13.860- 02:15.000* :  to tackle climate change.
*02:15.000- 02:18.020* :  Critics point out the statements aren't binding though.
*02:18.560- 02:23.920* :  Reports from Russia say police there have raided gay clubs in Moscow days after the Supreme Court
*02:23.920- 02:27.580* :  outlawed what it called the International LGBT Movement.
*02:30.500- 02:34.640* :  Also in this podcast, what's going on in your brain when you look at a piece of art?
*02:34.980- 02:40.420* :  I am just looking up my own brainwaves, and I think what is so fascinating about this is that
*02:40.740- 02:46.120* :  the visualisation shows these as beautiful waves that are kind of crashing over each other and into
*02:46.120- 02:46.620* :  each other.
*02:50.920- 02:55.620* :  So we're going to begin in Gaza, where the temporary truce is now a distant memory.
*03:03.420- 03:07.800* :  People run for cover on Saturday as missiles hit apartment buildings in the
*03:07.800- 03:14.320* :  Hamad town area of Khan Unis. The city was targeted by a series of airstrikes and artillery fire
*03:14.700- 03:19.680* :  after the second day of resumed fighting. Several hundred thousand people from northern Gaza
*03:19.680- 03:24.380* :  had fled there, some camping intents, others in schools and around hospitals.
*03:24.460- 03:30.420* :  The Hamas-run health ministry says around 200 Palestinians have now been killed since the
*03:30.420- 03:36.040* :  ceasefire expired on Friday. Israel says it's introduced measures though, such as the dropping
*03:36.040- 03:42.600* :  of information leaflets and downloadable maps to try to prevent civilian casualties as the fighting
*03:42.600- 03:47.540* :  moved south. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the resumption of the ground
*03:47.540- 03:54.420* :  invasion of Gaza was the only way to destroy Hamas. We will continue the war until we reach all
*03:54.420- 04:00.120* :  its goals. These goals cannot be achieved without the ground operation. The ground operation has
*04:00.120- 04:05.240* :  been essential in bringing the results so far, and it will be essential in bringing the results later.
*04:06.140- 04:10.680* :  Well, as Israel's renewed bombardment of the Gaza Strip continues to intensify,
*04:10.680- 04:15.480* :  the UN's children's agency UNICEF has described the dropping of leaflets,
*04:15.480- 04:22.060* :  telling Palestinians to go to safe areas as almost cynical. Residents in the area have described
*04:22.060- 04:27.940* :  the airstrikes there as the heaviest bombing of the war. The Shaila Shui Pappmar spoke to UNICEF
*04:27.940- 04:33.400* :  spokesman James Elder, who's in Khan Unis, and first asked him about aid getting into Gaza.
*04:34.120- 04:40.660* :  Try to the horrors of Fervor 7. 500 trucks will come into the Gaza Strip commercial and
*04:40.660- 04:45.760* :  United Nations. Of course, for long periods of these last seven weeks, it's been none,
*04:46.280- 04:52.880* :  so 50 is still, it's triage. Everything right now is kind of triage, trying to almost stem the
*04:52.880- 04:59.200* :  bleeding. It does not allow for a meaningful humanitarian response, and so the notion that now
*04:59.200- 05:04.860* :  of a massive disease outbreak. You know, middle-class families who've lost homes, seen family members
*05:04.860- 05:12.660* :  killed, many family members moved twice, sorry, moved, moved, it's, it's quite relentless
*05:12.660- 05:17.540* :  of bombardments here. Moved twice, three times, and now they're living on three or four
*05:17.540- 05:22.500* :  litres of water a day, carrying what they've got, not enough food, surrogate sanitation systems
*05:22.500- 05:27.320* :  have broken down. There's no fuel for them, and of course many of the workers are a dead or
*05:27.320- 05:33.440* :  displaced. This is a nightmare, and as maybe you can hear or not, the bombardments continue
*05:33.440- 05:41.780* :  with some severity. And in terms of the situation with zones, these areas that are now designated
*05:41.780- 05:47.240* :  as unsafe zones, how helpful has that been? Because that's what Israel is saying now that they're
*05:47.240- 05:52.600* :  going to, to designate areas as unsafe zones to alert people and civilians in Gaza that these
*05:52.600- 05:56.480* :  aren't areas that they should be because those are areas that are targets for them.
*05:56.980- 06:03.340* :  Yes, and I'm told that some of those warnings come as an SMS 10 minutes before, almost
*06:03.340- 06:10.400* :  illogical, almost cynical, some of the, the leaflets that have come about where, which safe zones
*06:10.400- 06:15.780* :  to go, have a QR code on them, that would be for someone who had been able to power their phone
*06:15.780- 06:20.660* :  in a place where there's no electricity, apart from say a generator, and certainly where there's
*06:20.660- 06:27.960* :  no access to 4G or 5G Wi-Fi at all. These would be the same people who were in a same place in
*06:27.960- 06:33.520* :  the North, in a UN shelter that was bombed, and they've come here and be told to go somewhere else.
*06:34.000- 06:39.760* :  It's not real, and it's a very unsettled by the notion that people are taking, that they're
*06:39.760- 06:44.740* :  taking root with this idea. I see the families on the street, you see the anxiety,
*06:44.780- 06:49.020* :  looking at child when they know, as a child said today, when their mother was crying,
*06:49.020- 06:53.740* :  my mum just doesn't know where she's going, not that she was lost, but she was in a trance,
*06:53.740- 06:59.140* :  she's run out of places to go, they were trying to set up their home on a sidewalk,
*06:59.640- 07:03.500* :  so there is nowhere to go in the idea that this place is safe or this isn't.
*07:03.760- 07:08.440* :  Unfortunately, it's proven to be false in a lethal, lethal way for children when,
*07:08.880- 07:10.800* :  you know, when they're hit, and it was a safe place.
*07:11.560- 07:13.980* :  And James, can you tell us a bit about where you are right now?
*07:14.460- 07:17.840* :  Yeah, I'm in Canunas, so not far from Nassau Hospital,
*07:18.460- 07:22.500* :  densely, densely populated. I'm hit 1.8 million people and now,
*07:22.500- 07:29.720* :  and now in this area, so, and this is a, sorry, it's more explosion. I'm not far from the sea,
*07:29.720- 07:34.740* :  so again, I have no military expertise, but some of these, I'm understanding, that would be,
*07:35.180- 07:38.500* :  that would be artillery from the Navy, and the ones that really shape the windows,
*07:39.280- 07:42.520* :  or worse, glasses, glasses, you're great here with these things.
*07:43.200- 07:45.640* :  Glass and shrapnel do horrible things to a child's body,
*07:45.640- 07:51.060* :  so it's a guest house of sorts that, that we have for staff, that is a base,
*07:51.060- 07:56.920* :  and then you go on convoys to the north, or delivering aid here, wherever we can possibly get aid to,
*07:57.360- 08:00.600* :  I know the north is, is, is unreachable at the moment.
*08:01.480- 08:06.340* :  Well, that was James Elder, UNICEF spokesperson, who was in Canunas in southern Gaza.
*08:07.340- 08:11.100* :  The deputy head of Hamas' political wing has said there will be no more hostage
*08:11.100- 08:14.340* :  exchanges in Gaza until there's a permanent ceasefire.
*08:14.840- 08:19.280* :  Sheikh Salah al-Araury added that the remaining hostages, held by Hamas,
*08:19.660- 08:21.960* :  are all either soldiers or former soldiers,
*08:22.480- 08:25.980* :  and won't be released under the same terms as those already freed.
*08:26.760- 08:30.500* :  Earlier, it emerged that the head of Israel's Mossad Security Service
*08:30.880- 08:34.900* :  had ordered his negotiating team to pull out of ceasefire talks in Qatar.
*08:35.520- 08:38.820* :  David Barnea said the discussions had reached a dead end,
*08:39.300- 08:41.640* :  a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office,
*08:41.640- 08:45.900* :  said Hamas had failed to fulfill its obligations under the truce agreement.
*08:46.700- 08:50.660* :  While regarding all these developments, I spoke to our correspondent, Paul Adams,
*08:50.660- 08:55.600* :  who is in Jerusalem, and I first asked him for his assessment as the fighting goes on,
*08:55.820- 09:02.600* :  of Israel's strategy of issuing information maps of so-called safe and unsafe areas in the south of Gaza.
*09:03.320- 09:07.160* :  We have, for the first time today, the use of this new map,
*09:07.680- 09:11.700* :  in which the whole Gaza strip has been broken down into tiny little grid squares.
*09:12.160- 09:18.460* :  And for the first time, we saw a map with a cluster of those squares being an area where the
*09:18.460- 09:21.780* :  Israeli said that is where we're going to conduct military operations.
*09:21.780- 09:24.700* :  You should leave that area if you want to be safe.
*09:24.700- 09:29.340* :  In other words, what I think we're seeing now is less of an emphasis on safe areas,
*09:29.740- 09:32.100* :  and more of an emphasis on unsafe areas.
*09:32.500- 09:36.220* :  In other words, if you go out beyond this shaded area,
*09:36.220- 09:40.100* :  you will be safe from airstrikes. But Palestinians, for the last two months,
*09:40.100- 09:44.280* :  know that often they find themselves in places where there are airstrikes,
*09:44.280- 09:47.060* :  where they thought they were safe, because the Israelis continue to
*09:47.420- 09:51.080* :  conduct raids against what they consider to be high-value Hamas targets.
*09:51.220- 09:53.740* :  And those can happen anywhere and at any time.
*09:54.560- 09:57.600* :  And on the ceasefire talks, the Mossad chief is pulling his people back,
*09:57.600- 10:01.980* :  but we see that France has present Emmanuel Macron heading to Qatar to try and drum things up again.
*10:02.400- 10:05.640* :  I mean, where you are, what's the talk of in terms of prospects?
*10:05.980- 10:10.140* :  Maybe not perhaps in the next few days, but in the week ahead for another ceasefire?
*10:10.720- 10:15.180* :  I would be very surprised if we see any negotiations resuming that soon.
*10:15.820- 10:19.620* :  Certainly, Hamas officials are saying we will not see any more hostages released
*10:19.640- 10:22.920* :  until the military operation is over. Well, they might say that.
*10:23.320- 10:29.160* :  I don't think that Emmanuel Macron will by himself be able to revive a process that has been
*10:29.160- 10:33.940* :  a very, very delicate, complex set of negotiations involving the Israelis, the Egyptians,
*10:33.940- 10:37.180* :  the Qataris, and obviously officials from Hamas.
*10:37.580- 10:40.520* :  It seems to have broken down for now. It's all about fighting.
*10:40.520- 10:43.740* :  At some point, who knows, we may return to those negotiations,
*10:43.860- 10:46.560* :  but I don't feel that that's going to happen soon.
*10:46.880- 10:52.060* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Well, one last detail on the war in Israel and Gaza.
*10:52.540- 10:57.760* :  The Palestinian Higher Education Ministry in Gaza says a prominent scientist and his family
*10:58.300- 11:01.480* :  have been killed in an Israeli airstrike near Gaza City.
*11:02.060- 11:05.780* :  Sufyan Tayy was president of the Islamic University of Gaza
*11:06.180- 11:09.160* :  and a lead researcher in physics and applied mathematics.
*11:10.560- 11:14.620* :  Now, police in Russia have raided several LGBTQ clubs in the capital,
*11:14.620- 11:19.820* :  in what's being seen by some as more evidence of a crackdown on the gay community.
*11:20.380- 11:23.000* :  Officers said they were looking for drugs in the venues in Moscow,
*11:23.540- 11:27.260* :  but it follows a ruling in the Russian Supreme Court a few days ago,
*11:27.760- 11:32.880* :  which classed the International LGBT Movement as an extremist organization.
*11:32.880- 11:38.700* :  I spoke to our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss and asked him for more on the background to the story.
*11:39.360- 11:44.080* :  In some ways, this is an old story. LGBT rights in Russia have gone up and down through history.
*11:44.080- 11:51.000* :  It was actually back in 1832 that it was made illegal for as they put it for a man to lie down with another man.
*11:51.500- 11:54.780* :  Being caught violating that law could get you exiled to Siberia.
*11:55.180- 11:58.920* :  The Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 legalized homosexuality,
*11:58.920- 12:00.840* :  Stalin re-climbed, criminalized it.
*12:01.260- 12:03.400* :  Then when communism fell in the early 90s,
*12:03.400- 12:07.060* :  Mikhail Gorbachev, loose and restrictions, I hope you're keeping up here.
*12:07.740- 12:10.260* :  Under Vladimir Putin, there's been a steady crackdown.
*12:10.260- 12:13.700* :  First, they were laws preventing the promotion of homosexuality.
*12:14.160- 12:16.460* :  At times, this produced absurd results.
*12:16.460- 12:18.340* :  There was a Korean pop video, for example.
*12:18.340- 12:22.620* :  It had some rainbow colors and they were blotted out when it was shown on television.
*12:23.200- 12:25.760* :  But then, as you mentioned, there was been this recent crackdown.
*12:25.760- 12:28.640* :  On Thursday, the Ministry of Justice went to the Supreme Court
*12:28.640- 12:33.780* :  and had the International LGBT Movement declared an extremist organization.
*12:34.280- 12:38.260* :  Have to say, this is the first time I've ever heard of an organization being made illegal,
*12:38.260- 12:40.960* :  which, as far as I can tell, doesn't actually exist.
*12:40.960- 12:46.560* :  It's as if the Russian authorities needed an LGBT bogeyman to attack, so they invented one.
*12:46.780- 12:50.200* :  Okay, so that's the kind of history lesson in that the cultural ebb and flow.
*12:50.200- 12:54.140* :  Take us to Friday night. What actually happened in terms of these police raids in Moscow?
*12:54.500- 12:56.620* :  Well, it seems that four bars were raided.
*12:56.620- 12:59.660* :  We're relying, by the way, on local media here, and also a male sauna.
*12:59.660- 13:03.120* :  Police went in, checked identity papers, photographed them.
*13:03.120- 13:05.620* :  They were foreign as present, had their passports looked at.
*13:06.160- 13:10.600* :  This is clearly very intimidating at a time when many people in Russia are getting given
*13:10.600- 13:14.480* :  long-send prison sentences for any kind of violation or dissent at all.
*13:14.480- 13:18.940* :  Now, this may sound like a minor matter relative to everything else going on,
*13:18.980- 13:20.500* :  Russia. You've got a war going on.
*13:20.900- 13:22.760* :  Hundreds of thousands being sent to fight.
*13:22.760- 13:24.640* :  Many of them never to come back.
*13:24.640- 13:29.060* :  But in fact, in some ways, you could see this crack down on the LGBT community,
*13:29.580- 13:31.400* :  actually as central to everything.
*13:32.060- 13:37.080* :  This is because Vladimir Putin has portrayed the conflict in Ukraine as a defensive war
*13:37.560- 13:41.040* :  and telling people not only the Western NATO want to conquer Russia,
*13:41.040- 13:46.120* :  but telling them they want to crack down, destroy your morals, destroy your values.
*13:46.620- 13:49.340* :  As far as some people are concerned, in the Kremlin world view,
*13:49.880- 13:52.900* :  raiding a gay bar in Moscow is a war on the home front,
*13:53.460- 13:56.820* :  just as important as firing shells at Ukrainian troops in the Donbass.
*13:56.820- 13:59.760* :  And for that reason, I suspect we're going to see more of this.
*14:00.460- 14:00.960* :  Paul Moss.
*14:01.720- 14:05.740* :  Another agreement has been announced at the UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai.
*14:05.740- 14:07.220* :  This one is on renewables.
*14:07.260- 14:11.560* :  The COP28 meeting, as it's known, has started with a flurry of announcements.
*14:11.580- 14:16.240* :  More than 100 countries have promised to aim to treble their use of renewable
*14:16.240- 14:19.540* :  energy, like solar and wind power by 2030.
*14:20.220- 14:24.800* :  But a key figure, speaking on Saturday, also appeared to lower expectations on
*14:24.800- 14:27.140* :  efforts to slow the increase in global temperatures.
*14:27.780- 14:32.800* :  China's envoy Xi Jinping claimed that his country is facing huge challenges
*14:32.800- 14:37.680* :  in controlling methane gas emissions, which is a major contributor to global warming.
*14:38.280- 14:42.580* :  Our climate editor Justin Rowlett is there and starts his report with details on a man
*14:42.580- 14:45.080* :  who was supposed to make it, but in the end couldn't go.
*14:45.420- 14:47.280* :  The Pope couldn't make it to Dubai.
*14:47.280- 14:51.520* :  His doctor forbade him from traveling, but a cardinal read his words.
*14:51.940- 14:56.860* :  Climate change has run a mark, he said, and posed a question for the gathered leaders.
*14:57.780- 15:02.020* :  Are we working for a culture of life or a culture of death?
*15:03.300- 15:05.900* :  To all of you, I make this heartfelt appeal.
*15:06.920- 15:07.980* :  Let us choose life.
*15:08.920- 15:10.720* :  Let us choose the future.
*15:12.800- 15:17.600* :  He said fossil fuels have to go, and the Secretary-General of the UN agrees.
*15:17.840- 15:24.200* :  Today, the Chinese climate envoy Xi Xinhua and his American counterpart John Kerry
*15:24.540- 15:29.320* :  entered the meeting side by side, a sign of their closeness on the climate issue.
*15:30.280- 15:35.120* :  Gentlemen, will you commit to phasing out fossil fuels here in the UAE?
*15:35.960- 15:38.520* :  I think you're going to hear a good discussion in the next few days.
*15:39.460- 15:45.780* :  So no public commitments, but the US Vice President said America understands the challenge.
*15:46.280- 15:53.880* :  The urgency of this moment is clear. The clock is no longer just ticking, it is banging.
*15:55.160- 15:59.420* :  We need transformative change and exponential impact.
*16:00.360- 16:05.740* :  And it sounds like the President of these talks Dr. Sultan Al Jaba has also got the memo.
*16:06.040- 16:14.380* :  The world can break down if we don't rapidly transition to zero carbon alternatives.
*16:15.140- 16:18.660* :  These are facts we must come to terms with.
*16:19.480- 16:25.280* :  So does that mean the UAE believes the world can finally agree to phase out the use of
*16:25.280- 16:30.940* :  unabated fossil fuels? That's when you capture the CO2 to stop it causing climate change.
*16:30.940- 16:36.100* :  Here's what Simon Steele, the head of the UN body that runs these talks, had to say,
*16:36.100- 16:42.360* :  we have to try and it's up to parties. That is UN speak for only the countries of the world
*16:42.360- 16:48.400* :  can make that call, but there are some tantalizing hints here at COP28 that the world could be
*16:48.400- 16:56.160* :  gearing up for a really consequential decision, a promise to phase out fossil fuels over the coming
*16:56.160- 17:00.280* :  decades. Just in rollout reporting from the United Arab Emirates.
*17:03.180- 17:08.800* :  Still to come. In October, sensors picked up changes in the direction and severity of the tilt.
*17:09.440- 17:13.900* :  A further inspection revealed that some material in the base of the tower, like the stone and
*17:13.900- 17:18.780* :  brick, had begun disintegrating. The leaning tower in Italy that could be about to collapse
*17:19.220- 17:21.240* :  and know it's not the one in Pisa.
*17:25.140- 17:31.400* :  Now, as we record this, the United Nations says that two overcrowded boats carrying around 400
*17:31.400- 17:36.820* :  ethnic Rohingyas are thought to be drifting in the Andaman Sea. It's appealed to countries in
*17:36.820- 17:42.040* :  Southeast Asia to search for the vessels which have engine problems. The Rohingya are originally
*17:42.040- 17:46.220* :  from Myanmar, but fled the country because of persecution by the Burmese army.
*17:46.320- 17:50.180* :  Aurasia Pacific editor Mickey Brewster told James Kumara Sami Moore.
*17:50.640- 17:54.160* :  Well, we think they've come from Bangladesh and the refugee camps there,
*17:54.800- 18:01.400* :  containing nearly a million Rohingya people. And they're on their way to countries in Southeast
*18:01.400- 18:08.840* :  Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia primarily. Already in the last few weeks, we've had about a thousand
*18:08.840- 18:16.360* :  Rohingya refugees arrived in Ache province in Indonesia. And more actually have arrived
*18:16.360- 18:23.520* :  100 or so on Saturday. And these two boats, though, are at sea. Now, the United Nations, which has
*18:23.520- 18:28.220* :  put out an appeal for countries to go and help them believe that the engines have failed.
*18:28.220- 18:33.780* :  There are 400 people on board. It's not clear if they have enough food or water
*18:34.460- 18:39.820* :  they talk about you and talks about the weather situation being unpredictable. So, there's a real
*18:39.820- 18:47.660* :  fear for the lives of these people on these boats. And what has led to this exodus from the refugee
*18:47.660- 18:53.020* :  camps? Well, it happens every year about this time because the Andaman Sea is just calm enough
*18:53.020- 18:58.380* :  for boats to make this journey. Not all of them really see where they, not all of them are in great
*18:58.380- 19:04.300* :  condition. A lot of them are overcrowded. So, usually it's from November onwards that these
*19:04.300- 19:09.940* :  journeys are made. And it's happened for the last few years. And it's happening now. The area,
*19:10.600- 19:15.540* :  a couple of other things which are happening, though, to perhaps this year make this situation
*19:15.540- 19:22.420* :  more acute. Firstly, in Myanmar, there's been an uptake and an upsurge in violence. And that's
*19:22.420- 19:28.060* :  where these Rohingya people originally came from, many of them in 2017 when they were forced out
*19:28.060- 19:34.660* :  by the Burmese army. Also, many of these refugees, a lot of them live in a camp called Cox's
*19:34.660- 19:39.980* :  Bazar in Bangladesh. And the situation, the security situation there was just got worse. There's
*19:39.980- 19:46.260* :  a lot more violent crime, a lot of guns, a lot of robberies. This is what the UN is saying. And so,
*19:46.920- 19:53.080* :  they're immediate. These people's immediate safety and security isn't assured. So, if you can see
*19:53.080- 19:57.440* :  a situation developing where we're not safe where we are now, we don't see as ever being able to
*19:57.440- 20:02.020* :  go back to our original homes. That's going to force people to make more desperate decisions.
*20:02.560- 20:07.420* :  And what awaits them on the other side? Those who have made these crossings already? What kind of
*20:07.420- 20:12.700* :  life can they expect? That's a good question. And it's an uncertain one. Just over the last few weeks,
*20:12.700- 20:18.760* :  as I mentioned, about 1,000 Rohingya refugees have arrived in Acheh province, Indonesia's Acheh
*20:18.760- 20:24.240* :  province. And a lot of the people there, they're just not really welcoming. A lot of local people
*20:24.240- 20:28.620* :  are saying, just we don't want them here permanently. We're prepared to accept them in the short
*20:28.620- 20:33.240* :  term, not in the long term. That's Mickey Bristo, our Asia-Pacific editor.
*20:33.940- 20:38.980* :  Bikina Faso and Niger have followed Marley and announced that they are withdrawing from
*20:38.980- 20:44.720* :  an international force that was set up to fight Islamist militants in the Sahel region. All three
*20:44.720- 20:49.240* :  countries are run by military rulers following coups and have now formed their own alliance.
*20:49.880- 20:54.920* :  Chad and Mauritania are still part of the G5 force, which is meant to be made up of around
*20:54.920- 21:01.880* :  5,000 soldiers. Our Africa regional editor, Will Ross, has more. A statement from the military-led
*21:01.880- 21:07.560* :  governments of Bikina Faso and Niger was critical of the G5 force for failing to make the Sahel
*21:07.560- 21:13.260* :  region safer. It also suggested the anti-Jihadist force was serving foreign interests. They almost
*21:13.260- 21:18.380* :  certainly meant France. Relations with the former colonial power have dramatically deteriorated.
*21:18.380- 21:22.400* :  The big question is what impact this will have on the Islamist militant groups that have
*21:22.400- 21:26.860* :  been growing in strength. So far, there's no evidence to suggest that having soldiers in
*21:26.860- 21:31.580* :  charge of the country makes the population any safer from the threat of these al-Qaeda and
*21:31.580- 21:40.100* :  IS linked fighters. Will Ross, next to the BBC's 100 Women of 2023. Gloria Steinem has been a
*21:40.100- 21:45.720* :  leader of the global feminist movement since the 1970s, championing equality as a journalist,
*21:45.720- 21:51.220* :  a writer and a spokesperson, and she's been named in this year's BBC Award. Gloria Steinem
*21:51.220- 21:56.540* :  has been talking to the BBC's Faranaka Medi about the progress in women's rights that she's seen
*21:56.540- 22:02.720* :  and the main challenges that remain. We need to be honest and say what we're thinking. I mean,
*22:02.720- 22:10.160* :  men can't read our minds, but it is not our responsibility to make their revolution and their dinner.
*22:11.020- 22:18.640* :  You and I have grown up in some form of patriarchy that says that even in the family,
*22:19.460- 22:24.720* :  women are more responsible for taking care of infants and small children than men are,
*22:25.020- 22:31.500* :  even though men are parents too. So that's where a lack of democracy begins and that's
*22:32.040- 22:39.700* :  the beginning of change that we all can make, where the idea of domination and a lack of
*22:39.700- 22:46.900* :  democracy begins is in the family, and it's even more important and even more the cause of
*22:46.900- 22:54.680* :  future conflict to grow up with making discrimination and domination okay than national policies are.
*22:55.240- 23:01.420* :  The most obvious and simplest is that we can determine the fate of our own physical selves,
*23:02.080- 23:09.600* :  so we can decide whether and when to have children, not to have children because that's where
*23:10.300- 23:18.200* :  our difficulty begins because we happen to have wounds and they desire to control wounds is
*23:18.200- 23:27.340* :  very central to authoritarian systems. So, you know, it's clear that controlling reproduction
*23:27.620- 23:33.100* :  is crucial, yet when we talk about politics, we don't usually start there.
*23:33.940- 23:39.460* :  Another thing that nowadays everybody's talking about is cancel culture, you know, there's this fear
*23:39.460- 23:45.800* :  of speaking up, especially among the younger generation. What do you think of that? Do you actually
*23:45.800- 23:53.820* :  think that this is compromising the freedom of speech? I don't feel it myself, but I resent it on
*23:53.820- 24:02.200* :  behalf of anybody who does feel it because free speech is crucial to any democracy. We should not
*24:02.200- 24:11.160* :  submit to cancel culture. It's social pressure as censorship. Even when it is suppressing evidence
*24:11.160- 24:19.000* :  of bias, it still is silencing people. Now, what would you say is the biggest misconception people
*24:19.500- 24:24.600* :  make about you? Well, occasionally, especially when I was traveling a lot, people seem surprised
*24:24.600- 24:35.800* :  that I had a sense of humor. You're not just an angry feminist. I think also people look at the
*24:35.800- 24:44.920* :  movement and think that it is more limited to college-educated, quite women than it really is.
*24:45.720- 24:53.840* :  It's often started in quite the reverse way. If there is any legacy, I would just say
*24:54.620- 25:02.620* :  that I was trying to make the world a little more fair and a little more representative than it
*25:02.620- 25:09.020* :  was when I got here. That each of us is unique, so we shouldn't try to be like somebody else,
*25:09.320- 25:16.160* :  but perhaps we can gain support and inspiration from knowing people who came before us.
*25:16.760- 25:21.720* :  Gloria Steinem, who is one of this year's BBC's 100 Women, and if you want to find out more about
*25:21.720- 25:27.940* :  her and the other women on this year's list, then go to bbc.co.uk slash 100 women.
*25:29.040- 25:34.940* :  Next to Italy, and a medieval tower in the country has been sealed off because of a change in
*25:34.940- 25:41.040* :  how much it's leaning, and this isn't the world-famous Leaning Tower of Pisa. The Gary Sender Tower
*25:41.040- 25:47.020* :  in the city of Bologna is 47 metres high and it's tilted for hundreds of years, but the authorities
*25:47.020- 25:51.260* :  there say it's now unsafe and they fear it may collapse. Harry Blight has more.
*25:51.900- 25:56.420* :  Bologna in northern Italy is famous for its food, culture and historic buildings.
*25:56.420- 26:02.820* :  Among them are two medieval towers, and they're both leaning. They're known as Le Duetori,
*26:02.820- 26:08.960* :  or two towers, and were built more than 900 years ago. The Asinelli Tower is twice as high
*26:08.960- 26:13.260* :  and open for the public to climb, but it's the other tower that's become a problem.
*26:13.660- 26:19.100* :  The Gary Sender Tower leans more at a four-degree angle, a similar tilt to that of the famous
*26:19.100- 26:25.460* :  bell tower in Pisa, but in October, sensors picked up changes in the direction and severity of the
*26:25.460- 26:30.660* :  tilt. A further inspection revealed that some material in the base of the tower, like the stone
*26:30.660- 26:36.540* :  and brick, had begun disintegrating and cracks had appeared. In order to protect the tower itself,
*26:36.540- 26:42.100* :  and for people in building surrounding it, the local council has begun constructing a five-metre
*26:42.100- 26:47.440* :  high barrier, as well as metal containers and wire mesh to catch any falling debris.
*26:48.360- 26:52.600* :  It's estimated that just a protection barrier surrounding the tower will cost more than
*26:52.600- 26:57.300* :  four and a half million dollars. The council has begun a crowdfunding campaign to fund the
*26:57.300- 27:02.500* :  restoration work. These bright red barriers will only be temporary, and their new research will
*27:02.500- 27:07.620* :  begin to find a way to stabilize the tower and then correct the underlying problem. Cracks in the
*27:07.620- 27:12.880* :  brick have been noted previously on this tower. In 2020, steel rods and cables were fitted around
*27:12.880- 27:17.900* :  the base, but these are said to have aggravated the problem. A collapse is not believed to be
*27:17.900- 27:23.300* :  imminent, but the authorities are taking precautions. A scientific committee has been monitoring the
*27:23.300- 27:29.320* :  site since 2019, equipment including acoustic and movement sensors monitor the building's lean
*27:29.320- 27:35.160* :  every 15 minutes, and if there's a warning of a collapse, the surrounding area can be evacuated.
*27:35.720- 27:40.600* :  Harry Bly. Now, we're coming to an end now, but first I'm going to ask you to concentrate
*27:40.600- 27:46.460* :  on your brain. Specifically, what's going on inside it when you look at a painting or a photograph
*27:46.460- 27:52.440* :  or a building any work of art, in fact? A gallery and museum tour is just about to get underway
*27:52.440- 27:57.540* :  here in the UK, and it lets visitors put on a headset and see a real-time 3D computer
*27:58.180- 28:03.180* :  representation of their brainwaves. Caroline Wyatt's got to try it out at the Victorian Albert Museum
*28:03.180- 28:08.920* :  here in London. So we're going to put this headset on you. It's a simple EEG headset that goes
*28:09.000- 28:14.200* :  over your ears. I'm Will McNeill and I'm a creative director at a digital agency called The Mil,
*28:14.760- 28:20.100* :  and we were brought on to design and develop the technology for this project. It's measuring
*28:20.100- 28:24.820* :  electromagnetic activity off your brain, and then this application, which we've written,
*28:24.860- 28:30.140* :  translates it into this 3D animation, which shows a lot of different things about what's going on
*28:30.140- 28:34.160* :  in your brain as you're looking at art. Do you have a screen in the middle, and I'm now
*28:34.160- 28:39.440* :  wearing this headset, and I'm not looking at the eye, I am just looking at my own brainwaves,
*28:39.560- 28:46.360* :  and I think what is so fascinating about this is that the visualisation shows these as beautiful
*28:46.400- 28:53.120* :  waves that are kind of crashing over each other and into each other, and they kind of flow
*28:53.120- 28:59.200* :  amazingly. I'm Jenny Waldman, I'm Director of Art Fund, and we were fascinated to find out more
*28:59.200- 29:05.800* :  about what happens to our brains when we look at art, and what we've found is that art genuinely
*29:05.800- 29:13.180* :  does inspire our brains to make different connections, so we could really genuinely say that art
*29:13.180- 29:19.940* :  is beneficial for us, but what's really interesting, post-pandemic, 40% of people are not really going
*29:19.940- 29:26.180* :  to museums anymore, so this is a way that Art Fund can just remind us all, post-pandemic,
*29:26.180- 29:31.960* :  we could all get back into museums, and that would be fantastic. It's the shape and the movement
*29:31.960- 29:36.560* :  of the waves is really telling us what's happening in your head right now, so we've identified the
*29:36.980- 29:40.760* :  pattern in brainwaves that occurs when someone is going through some problem solving,
*29:41.160- 29:45.240* :  trying to understand what they're looking at, and we turn that into a kind of corkscrewing effect,
*29:45.260- 29:49.240* :  so the three-dimensional animation starts to kind of wrap around itself and weave.
*29:49.500- 29:54.640* :  So Caroline's looking at a painting by Degas, it's quite a dark scene and there's an orchestra
*29:54.640- 29:59.280* :  in the foreground, but in the background the actual opera scene is a little bit convoluted,
*29:59.280- 30:03.840* :  a little bit hard to read. What I'm trying to figure out in this painting is am I looking at the orchestra,
*30:03.860- 30:08.940* :  am I looking at the audience, because it's a wonderful painting, but it's not entirely clear.
*30:09.300- 30:13.240* :  And we can see some things happening in Caroline's brainwaves here where I'm starting to see
*30:13.240- 30:17.740* :  corkscrewing, she's trying to kind of understand the scene, your mind is processing a lot,
*30:17.740- 30:22.360* :  your visual cortex is working. Did you always have an interest in what happens to the brain
*30:22.360- 30:27.580* :  when people look at Art? I mean I am a digital artist, so I am always trying to be creative
*30:27.580- 30:32.940* :  with technology, but I'm also interested in what art does to me, how art makes me feel.
*30:33.460- 30:37.800* :  I work in a field where I'm often under a lot of pressure to create things quickly and be creative
*30:37.800- 30:42.780* :  at the same time. It's quite a nice experience for me to go into a gallery and just relax and look
*30:42.780- 30:47.760* :  at Art, seeing this does actually confirm what I expected, which is that looking at Art is not a
*30:47.760- 30:52.780* :  passive thing. Our brains are very active when we look at Art, and we are going through a kind of
*30:53.260- 30:57.560* :  a type of meditation when we look at Art, and I think that's really important people recognize that.
*30:58.060- 31:02.780* :  Well that was Caroline Wyatt and her brilliant brainwaves with the help of a few others at the Victoria
*31:02.780- 31:09.340* :  and Albert Museum here in London. Well that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition
