*01:13.360- 01:20.100* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Valerie Sanderson at 1400
*01:20.100- 01:26.440* :  hours GMT on Friday the 29th of December. These are our main stories. Deaths are recorded after
*01:26.440- 01:33.600* :  Russia launches more than 150 missiles across Ukraine. A peace initiative is developing in Cairo
*01:33.600- 01:42.340* :  as the Israelis continue strikes on Gaza also. My duty and obligation is to uphold the constitution
*01:42.780- 01:48.700* :  and I made a determination that I did my decision as thorough and based on the rule of law
*01:48.700- 01:55.000* :  the facts for me. Why it's becoming more difficult for Donald Trump to get back into the White House.
*01:57.460- 02:03.840* :  Also in this podcast, lovers of luxury in Switzerland may soon have to say farewell to Fagra and
*02:03.940- 02:08.640* :  I don't like shocks. That's why I'm sitting on the beach always. I don't go into the water.
*02:08.940- 02:12.500* :  House South Africans are taking measures to prevent shark attacks.
*02:16.100- 02:21.180* :  We start in Ukraine where the sound of air defense sirens rang out through the night in the capital
*02:21.180- 02:25.760* :  Keeve. Then in the morning, the sound of at least three big explosions in the city center.
*02:26.260- 02:30.260* :  Mareshka Papalushkaita is a journalist who lives in the capital.
*02:30.560- 02:36.860* :  Right now Keeve is on air alert and a few minutes before the broadcast, I hear a few loud explosions
*02:36.860- 02:45.580* :  right here in Keeves. I'm so stressed right now but we tried to continue our lives because we
*02:45.580- 02:52.300* :  have no choice. It's our country, it's our lives. I go to work, I study, I raised my eight-year
*02:52.300- 03:00.160* :  assaults on in all these war conditions. But I feel like I can become a new victim every day
*03:00.160- 03:05.880* :  because Russia continues to kill us. And it wasn't just Keeve under attack. The authorities in
*03:05.880- 03:11.140* :  Ukraine say Russia has launched a wave of missile strikes across the country, targeting Keeve,
*03:11.140- 03:17.120* :  Liviv, Sumi Odessa and several other smaller urban areas. There are official reports of at least
*03:17.120- 03:24.220* :  18 deaths. The attack came a day after President Zelensky thanked the US for its latest $250 million
*03:24.220- 03:30.160* :  military aid package using the last of the money authorized so far. I got more from our correspondent
*03:30.300- 03:37.040* :  James Waterhouse who's in Keeve. What is clear is that this is a coordinated widespread attack on
*03:37.040- 03:43.440* :  Ukraine. And the Air Force, just to give you an idea, is saying it had never seen so many incoming
*03:43.440- 03:49.440* :  missiles on its monitors. And I think in a war where the whole of Ukraine is routinely targeted
*03:49.440- 03:56.040* :  by Russian missile and drone attacks, that really is saying something. We've had drone strikes
*03:56.040- 04:00.480* :  in the western city of Liviv, which often feels far from the conflict, hundreds of miles away
*04:00.480- 04:04.700* :  from where I am now. In the southern city of Odessa, a high rise apartment block has been
*04:05.240- 04:09.920* :  heavily damaged. There are reports of a hospital and shopping centre being hit in the eastern
*04:09.920- 04:15.700* :  city of Niplo, northeastern city of Sumi. I could go on. Hardgivers come under a missile attack,
*04:15.700- 04:22.920* :  and I think it's the scale of this attack, which has seemingly overwhelmed Ukraine's air defenses.
*04:23.380- 04:28.080* :  So James, what do you think about the timing of the sick attack? Because it comes just a day,
*04:28.080- 04:35.260* :  doesn't it? After President Zelensky thanked the US for its latest approved multi-million dollar
*04:35.260- 04:40.140* :  military aid package. There's always a temptation, certainly among Ukrainians you speak to, to make
*04:40.140- 04:45.620* :  the connection between other events and attacks like this. And it is true that Russia has responded
*04:46.180- 04:51.540* :  in this kind of way when things might not have gone, Moscow's way in other areas. But it has been a
*04:51.540- 04:59.220* :  week where Ukraine received the last of an approved US military aid package, $250 million. Yes,
*04:59.220- 05:04.640* :  it's a lot. It will replenish ammunition stores, missiles, as well as air defenses themselves.
*05:05.640- 05:11.340* :  But Ukraine will be looking at what it could have had, or is yet to have, which is a military
*05:11.340- 05:16.680* :  package worth more than $50 billion, which is getting caught up in Congress over a political
*05:16.680- 05:21.280* :  disagreement over whether the funds should be provided or not. So I think that's a reflection
*05:21.280- 05:28.120* :  of growing skepticism in the West. But it is an uncertain time for Ukraine, because that latter
*05:28.120- 05:33.180* :  package would enable it, in key of view, to not just continue to defend itself, but to continue
*05:33.180- 05:38.300* :  to pursue its dream. And it feels like a dream at the moment. It can change of liberating all of
*05:38.300- 05:43.620* :  its territory. But it's also been a week where Ukraine struck a major Russian landing vessel
*05:43.620- 05:49.740* :  in the heart of occupied Crimea, which would have undoubtedly frustrated Russian operations there.
*05:49.740- 05:54.240* :  So you do wonder if it is retaliation, you can't rule it out, but of course we'll never know for
*05:54.240- 05:59.360* :  sure. And what does it tell us about the conflict, as it enters its third calendar year?
*05:59.500- 06:04.580* :  It is a conflict that is very much in the midst of a stalemate. If you look at the eastern
*06:05.300- 06:11.260* :  front lines, it is Russia launching wave after wave of attack. We are seeing Russia continue to
*06:11.260- 06:16.060* :  launch missile strikes that we've just discussed. And there's very little movement in the south
*06:16.060- 06:20.940* :  as well where Ukraine had been hoping to punch through at the start of its counteroffensive.
*06:20.940- 06:26.840* :  We are seeing yes, targeted missile strikes deep into occupied Crimea, which is Ukraine playing
*06:26.840- 06:32.500* :  the long game, I think. But time is not Ukraine's friend. There are powerful western politicians who
*06:32.500- 06:37.700* :  are wanting a faster return for the billions of dollars it's signed up to date. So Ukraine is
*06:37.700- 06:43.400* :  being pressured to deliver fast results. But 2023 and Russia can not only keep attacking,
*06:43.400- 06:46.700* :  but it can defend what it has taken from Ukraine so far.
*06:47.120- 06:51.020* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev will mean while just over the border in Poland,
*06:51.020- 06:56.960* :  officials say an unidentified object has entered Polish airspace from the direction of Ukraine.
*06:56.960- 07:00.020* :  Adam Eastern sent us this report from Warsaw.
*07:00.580- 07:05.120* :  A Polish armed forces spokesman said radar picked up the object when it entered the country's
*07:05.120- 07:10.460* :  airspace from Ukraine, but the signal was subsequently lost. There have been no report yet the
*07:10.460- 07:16.180* :  object has been found, nor of any injuries. The spokesman said the event may be linked to Russia's
*07:16.180- 07:21.640* :  large-scale missile and drone attack overnight against Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
*07:21.640- 07:26.960* :  at least two missiles have landed in Poland, a member of NATO. In November last year,
*07:26.960- 07:31.860* :  two farmers were killed after a rocket, believed to have been fired by Ukrainian air defense forces,
*07:31.860- 07:36.020* :  trying to repel a Russian attack, landed in a Polish village near the border.
*07:36.520- 07:43.280* :  Adam Eastern, there has been no let-up in Israel's air strikes on Gaza, with nearly 190 people dead
*07:43.280- 07:49.160* :  in the past 24 hours. Forty of those died as thousands gathered in the southern town of Rafa.
*07:49.740- 07:51.780* :  This man spoke to us after arriving there.
*07:54.220- 08:00.060* :  We are here. We are suffering. No clean bathrooms, no toilets, no food. It was really hard to find
*08:00.060- 08:04.660* :  in wheat. We suffer from everything, also water. We suffer from all sides.
*08:05.440- 08:10.520* :  A peace initiative in Cairo is also continuing, which was due to be joined by a delegation from
*08:10.520- 08:15.560* :  Hamas. I spoke to our correspondent, Yolandael, who is in Jerusalem, and I asked her about the
*08:15.560- 08:20.560* :  Israeli army expanding its operation in the southern Gaza city of Hanyudas.
*08:20.980- 08:26.560* :  This is a city that Israel considers to be a main Hamas terror center. That's what it said in
*08:26.560- 08:32.020* :  recent days, and it's actually sent an additional military brigade to that city, which has been so
*08:32.020- 08:37.140* :  much the focus of heavy urban combat. But we're hearing also in the past day or so that there have
*08:37.140- 08:43.040* :  been intense Israeli air strikes there, continued shelling as well. At least eight people were killed
*08:43.040- 08:47.960* :  in Hanyunas in one strike yesterday. We heard about from medics at the hospital there.
*08:47.960- 08:52.860* :  We had the Defence Minister, you have glanced going to Hanyunas yesterday,
*08:52.860- 08:58.740* :  and he was talking there about how determination and perseverance would be required. But he said
*08:58.740- 09:03.100* :  this was an essential stage of Israel's mission to, in his words, destroy Hamas.
*09:03.600- 09:09.840* :  So people trying to find somewhere to go, actually, in Gaza, is there a bottleneck developing,
*09:09.840- 09:15.680* :  do you think, in Raffa, the southernmost tip of Gaza? There is in Raffa, and the other city that's
*09:15.680- 09:21.880* :  really been overwhelmed is Deir Abalach, which is the main town in the center of the Gaza strip.
*09:21.900- 09:26.620* :  This is because you have tens of thousands of guards and have been fleeing these three urban
*09:26.620- 09:32.160* :  refugee camps in the center of Gaza after they were ordered out by Israeli forces as their tanks
*09:32.160- 09:36.600* :  advance from the north and from the east. And so people have been making their way south and west,
*09:36.600- 09:41.320* :  so to Deir Abalach, where we've had scenes of people pitching makeshift tents,
*09:41.320- 09:47.320* :  putting up sheets of plastic on patches of open ground anywhere that's not already inhabited.
*09:47.320- 09:53.080* :  And the same thing also in Raffa, where the UN says another 100,000 people have arrived just
*09:53.080- 09:58.280* :  in the past few days. And this is a city on the border with Egypt that's already become the most
*09:58.280- 10:03.660* :  densely populated area of anywhere in the Gaza strip, because of all the displaced people who've
*10:03.660- 10:08.920* :  gathered there. And what about this peace initiative in Cairo? Well, this is an important development,
*10:08.920- 10:13.780* :  but we're being very cautious about it, Egypt and Qatar, of course, have been these key mediators
*10:13.780- 10:18.680* :  for Israel and Hamas. But we haven't really seen much progress since last month's week-long
*10:18.680- 10:23.880* :  truce, collapsed, which saw Israeli hostages being freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners
*10:23.880- 10:29.660* :  in Israeli jails. We understand that our Hamas officials now in Cairo and that the plan
*10:29.660- 10:34.860* :  involves new renewable ceasefires, staggered hostages release in exchange for more Palestinian
*10:34.860- 10:38.800* :  prisoners. The Egyptians saying that this could potentially lead to a full ceasefire.
*10:39.400- 10:45.580* :  Yolandael. A second US state has barred Donald Trump from running to be the Republican party's
*10:45.580- 10:50.680* :  candidate in the presidential election next year. Maine in the northeast of America has joined
*10:50.680- 10:55.720* :  Colorado in disqualifying him. The decision was made by Maine's Secretary of State,
*10:55.720- 11:02.320* :  Shenabellos. I hope that the United States Supreme Court will settle this matter nation-wide.
*11:03.120- 11:09.620* :  That being said, every Secretary of State must uphold the election laws in their state.
*11:10.560- 11:17.080* :  The events of January 6 were tragic and unprecedented, and the evidence presented in hearing
*11:17.080- 11:24.980* :  for me that I was duty bound to rule upon, indicated that January 6, 2021 was in fact an
*11:24.980- 11:30.520* :  insurrection, and Mr. Trump did in fact engage in that insurrection. Well, the matter is
*11:30.520- 11:34.760* :  bound to go to the Supreme Court, as our Washington correspondent, Gary O'Donohue,
*11:35.180- 11:40.480* :  told the BBC's Oliver Conway. This ruling is a sort of preliminary one in Maine. In other words,
*11:40.480- 11:45.620* :  it has to go through the whole court process. The Secretary of State, who's said that Donald
*11:45.620- 11:51.180* :  Trump can't go on the primary, is the senior election official, but there's still a process of
*11:51.180- 11:56.900* :  appeal that's in place. But I think it adds to the position we've got in Colorado where the
*11:56.960- 12:02.460* :  Supreme Court there, the State Supreme Court, has already said that Mr. Trump's name shouldn't
*12:02.460- 12:06.160* :  appear on the ballot. Having said that, there have been some other states that have said,
*12:06.700- 12:11.660* :  no, we don't buy this constitutional argument that someone allegedly involved in
*12:11.660- 12:16.520* :  insurrection is ineligible to run for office, and that is why, as you alluded to in your
*12:17.040- 12:22.480* :  introduction there, that this will inevitably have to end up at the United States Supreme Court,
*12:22.840- 12:28.520* :  which, quite honestly, Oli, is going to be one of the most momentous cases and decisions it's
*12:28.520- 12:34.700* :  going to have to make in years. Yeah, when is that likely to happen? And what might the US Supreme
*12:34.700- 12:40.100* :  Court do? Well, it's going to happen pretty soon because the primary elections at any rate get
*12:40.100- 12:45.960* :  underway on the 15th of January in Iowa. So they come pretty thick and fast in the coming months,
*12:46.020- 12:50.500* :  and the court will be cognizant of that. So there'll be a lot of pressure on the justices
*12:51.920- 12:58.400* :  in Supreme Court to take up the case, the Republicans in Colorado, the Republican Party has already
*12:58.400- 13:03.160* :  asked the Supreme Court, the US Supreme Court to take up the case. We haven't heard any details
*13:03.160- 13:08.620* :  about when or how they plan to do that. They'd have to take oral arguments, don't forget, they then
*13:09.200- 13:14.120* :  go in and think about it for a bit, but they will be under pressure to get this thing sorted
*13:14.120- 13:18.500* :  pretty quick. And of course it comes at a time when they're not just being asked to adjudicate on
*13:18.500- 13:26.380* :  whether Donald Trump is ineligible to run for the presidency under this element of the Constitution,
*13:26.380- 13:32.040* :  the 14th Amendment, but they're also going to be asked by a special council whether it's okay
*13:32.060- 13:39.140* :  to prosecute Donald Trump on criminal charges as a former president, a alleged crimes
*13:39.140- 13:45.140* :  committed while he was president. So there's a couple of great big stonking constitutional
*13:45.320- 13:50.960* :  questions that those nine justices, six more conservative leanings, three more liberal leanings,
*13:50.960- 13:57.540* :  going to have to decide in really quite short order. Gary Adonihue, Russia is holding an election
*13:57.540- 14:03.700* :  next year too, but only one candidate has a realistic chance. A Russia editor Stephen Rosenberg
*14:03.700- 14:08.880* :  reports on how hopes of democracy have faded since the end of the Soviet Union.
*14:12.540- 14:19.420* :  It was December 1993, and I was sitting in my flat in Moscow watching what must have been one
*14:19.420- 14:25.520* :  of the first ever election night results shows on Russian television for a parliamentary election.
*14:26.420- 14:33.140* :  That night, as well as electing a new parliament, the Duma, Russians also approved a new constitution.
*14:34.160- 14:40.220* :  The constitution, which many years later, Vladimir Putin would change through a referendum
*14:40.860- 14:47.200* :  to give himself the chance of 12 more years in power. I can tell you now, pretty much,
*14:47.200- 14:53.780* :  what the result of next marches Russian presidential election will be. Vladimir Putin will win,
*14:53.780- 15:01.600* :  and with a landslide. Russia's current political system is Putin's political system. His rules,
*15:02.300- 15:08.300* :  his election. And although his will not be the only name on the ballot, the president's
*15:08.300- 15:13.440* :  most high-profile opponents have either fled into exile or been put in prison.
*15:14.260- 15:20.560* :  What's more, the Kremlin controls television. Vladimir Putin receives lots of air time.
*15:21.320- 15:25.100* :  And on TV, he's much praised, never criticised.
*15:30.280- 15:33.660* :  Alexander is a young TV reporter from Northeastern Russia.
*15:34.680- 15:39.280* :  At Vladimir Putin's end-of-year press conference recently, he stood up and declared,
*15:39.960- 15:47.320* :  we all support your decision to run in next year's election, because you've been in power for as long as I can remember.
*15:49.040- 15:54.420* :  There are many Russians, like Alexander, who simply cannot imagine anyone else in the Kremlin.
*15:55.200- 16:00.400* :  Not because they idolise Vladimir Putin. They just see no alternative to him.
*16:01.040- 16:08.800* :  I've often heard people here say, well, if not Putin, who then? The Kremlin has engineered that.
*16:09.480- 16:15.640* :  It has cleared the political landscape of any potential challenges to the man who has ruled Russia
*16:16.080- 16:22.680* :  as president or prime minister for nearly a quarter of a century, to make sure that those two words,
*16:23.360- 16:26.980* :  that little question, who then, is left unanswered.
*16:27.560- 16:32.220* :  Even the war in Ukraine, and what are believed to be huge Russian military losses,
*16:32.880- 16:37.840* :  don't appear to have sparked disillusionment in Russia's president and commander-in-chief.
*16:38.700- 16:43.980* :  Some Russians believe that at a time of war, it is their duty to back their leader
*16:44.740- 16:47.740* :  without questioning his motives or the consequences.
*16:48.660- 16:53.180* :  Crucially, the other thing you find a lot of here is indifference.
*16:53.760- 16:57.440* :  Many Russians don't seem to care who's in power in the Kremlin.
*16:57.440- 17:04.160* :  They just hunker down in their town or village and try to get through life as best they can.
*17:04.940- 17:06.540* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
*17:09.060- 17:10.460* :  Still to calm on this podcast.
*17:22.500- 17:27.640* :  A robot space plane takes to the skies, but what will it mean for travel in the future?

*17:58.580- 18:05.260* :  to give you the context and analysis that you need to make sense of what's going on in our region.
*18:05.480- 18:08.860* :  You can find the Bay wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:12.380- 18:17.540* :  Remarkable personal stories.
*18:17.540- 18:21.000* :  Trail. It runs through my life and runs through my story.
*18:21.200- 18:22.320* :  Deep dive documentaries.
*18:22.320- 18:26.220* :  These children are using their own bags, not to carry books,
*18:26.580- 18:30.240* :  but they carry the drug markets is Sweden on their shoulders.
*18:30.660- 18:33.060* :  And sport, but not as you know it.
*18:33.120- 18:37.260* :  There's this massive landslide of myth and somewhere in there is the truth.
*18:37.400- 18:40.180* :  The BBC World Service tells the world stories.
*18:40.180- 18:44.580* :  Search for lives less ordinary, the documentary and amazing sport stories.
*18:44.920- 18:46.460* :  Wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:48.380- 18:52.940* :  To Borundi now, where even though homosexuality in the country is already illegal,
*18:52.940- 18:58.940* :  the president has gone a step further and now says homosexuals should be stoned to death in public.
*18:58.940- 19:03.320* :  I asked our Africa Regional Editor Richard Hamilton, what's going on?
*19:03.880- 19:08.260* :  President and Dishimae was speaking to journalists and he said,
*19:08.260- 19:12.920* :  I think if we find these people and he meant gay people in Borundi,
*19:13.160- 19:18.720* :  they should be taken to stadiums and be stoned and doing so would not be a crime.
*19:18.720- 19:23.980* :  He went on to say that homosexuality is like choosing between Satan and God.
*19:24.520- 19:29.720* :  And he said, if you want to choose Satan, then go and live in those countries which allow homosexuality.
*19:30.280- 19:32.720* :  And basically remain there and don't come back.
*19:32.760- 19:39.680* :  And then he said that Borundi should not bow to Western donors and international pressure over this issue.
*19:40.180- 19:44.060* :  And he said, if they did, then they should keep their aid in his words.
*19:44.760- 19:47.100* :  This is a wider issue though, isn't it Richard?
*19:47.320- 19:50.900* :  Yeah, very much so. The most notable case was in Uganda.
*19:50.920- 19:56.400* :  In May, President Masseveni signed into law the Anti-Homosexuality Act,
*19:56.780- 19:58.940* :  which is one of the world's harshest.
*19:59.240- 20:04.260* :  That proposes the death penalty for what they call aggravated homosexuality,
*20:04.260- 20:08.140* :  which is, for example, having same sex with a minor,
*20:08.760- 20:12.540* :  and also proposes life imprisonment for homosexual acts.
*20:12.900- 20:17.880* :  Similarly in Kenya, some MPs are pushing for a law to be like Uganda.
*20:17.880- 20:19.380* :  It's already illegal there.
*20:19.880- 20:24.460* :  And MPs in Ghana have also voted to amend their anti-gay legislation.
*20:24.460- 20:29.820* :  It's called the promotion of proper human sexual rights and Ghanaian family values bill.
*20:30.320- 20:35.980* :  This proposes three years prison sentence for anyone identifying as LGBTQ plus
*20:36.400- 20:39.300* :  and ten years for promoting homosexuality.
*20:39.620- 20:46.460* :  It's thought that this rise in anti-gay feelings has been promoted by American Evangelical groups
*20:46.460- 20:50.220* :  which have been pushing their agenda, including the Mormon Church.
*20:50.940- 20:56.120* :  Although the US is also threatening to pull aid out of places like Uganda because of this,
*20:56.140- 20:57.640* :  so that it's sort of pulling both ways.
*20:58.060- 21:00.600* :  And it's created a schism in the Anglican Church.
*21:01.260- 21:06.140* :  But I have to say there are a few African countries where the direction is going in the other way.
*21:06.140- 21:10.500* :  So for example, in Angola, Gabon and Botswana,
*21:10.640- 21:13.400* :  they have all decriminalized homosexuality.
*21:13.880- 21:17.380* :  Richard Hamilton. The authorities in India have issued a red alert
*21:17.380- 21:22.400* :  for dense fog in the capital Delhi and the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana.
*21:22.580- 21:25.920* :  Visibility has dropped to less than 50 metres in many places,
*21:25.920- 21:29.780* :  and people have been advised not to travel unless absolutely essential.
*21:29.980- 21:34.640* :  On Thursday, more than 100 flights and 20 trains in the capital were delayed,
*21:34.640- 21:38.260* :  and road accidents have been reported in parts of northern India.
*21:38.900- 21:43.060* :  Among those peering through the fog is our very own South Asia editor,
*21:43.400- 21:47.360* :  and Barassan Etharajan, and I asked him what it's like in Delhi.
*21:47.940- 21:52.720* :  Well, I'm at Cannot Place, also called Astrology Chalk in the Indian Capital Delhi,
*21:52.720- 21:57.540* :  a busy and abasning commercial area with full of cars and other vehicles.
*21:58.300- 22:03.220* :  Now, the fog has cleared a bit because it is after known here, a bit of wind.
*22:03.800- 22:06.280* :  But this morning, it was pretty bad when we were traveling,
*22:06.600- 22:08.800* :  and the visibility was pretty less.
*22:09.460- 22:13.200* :  And this is the first time this season, the government was saying about red alert
*22:13.200- 22:18.180* :  because the fog was dense, and we also hear from friends and colleagues
*22:18.180- 22:21.800* :  where at the airport that the flights have been delayed by several hours,
*22:21.800- 22:25.200* :  and it has been happening for the last four or five days,
*22:25.300- 22:30.060* :  and the met officials here say that the situation is likely to continue
*22:30.480- 22:32.980* :  till the end of this month, up to first of January.
*22:33.580- 22:38.080* :  But it is basically during from midnight up until 10 or 11 a.m. in the morning,
*22:38.080- 22:42.220* :  and that is also causing lots of accidents on the motorways,
*22:42.280- 22:45.780* :  or the highways leading outside the capital.
*22:45.780- 22:48.880* :  Delhi and also going to other northern Indian states.
*22:49.340- 22:52.460* :  Well, you're there. I can hear the cars and vehicles behind you.
*22:52.580- 22:56.420* :  I mean, is it really dangerous to drive, do you think, with this fog?
*22:57.580- 22:59.020* :  That's what the authorities say.
*22:59.020- 23:03.680* :  Avoid travel during the night or early in the morning, travel much later.
*23:04.680- 23:08.680* :  But in the city, it is fine because you can see lots of things here,
*23:08.680- 23:11.280* :  whereas you fuel on the highway in the countryside,
*23:11.900- 23:13.680* :  then the fog doesn't clear that much.
*23:13.680- 23:17.860* :  What they say is, during night when the land gets really cool,
*23:18.000- 23:22.040* :  then the water vapor, because the air cannot contain that much moisture,
*23:22.040- 23:23.860* :  the water vapor causes this fog.
*23:24.300- 23:27.520* :  And in addition to that industrial and vehicle pollution,
*23:27.640- 23:31.940* :  that is adding to the fog, that is also worsening the air quality,
*23:32.460- 23:36.500* :  and also in Punjab and in Haryana states, we also hear about this accident
*23:36.500- 23:38.140* :  because of the less visibility.
*23:38.780- 23:40.340* :  But thousands of people have been stranded,
*23:40.340- 23:42.060* :  because they have to wait for several hours.
*23:42.760- 23:45.180* :  Many trains from Delhi to other parts of India,
*23:45.180- 23:47.220* :  long distance trains have also been delayed,
*23:47.840- 23:50.560* :  and the authorities say that till the first of January,
*23:50.560- 23:55.580* :  the situation will be like this, even though fog is a normal at this point of time.
*23:56.060- 23:58.380* :  But this year, they are seeing it for several days.
*23:58.420- 23:59.700* :  It is a causing disruption.
*24:00.680- 24:02.720* :  And Barathan Itharajan in Delhi.
*24:03.600- 24:04.300* :  And in Florida,
*24:17.260- 24:22.620* :  That was the sign of the U.S. military's secretive X-37B robot space plane,
*24:22.620- 24:26.360* :  finally blasting off after a series of four starts and delays.
*24:26.920- 24:29.660* :  The size of a small bus, it is like a mini-space shuttle,
*24:29.660- 24:33.460* :  but few know what technology or experiments are contained within.
*24:34.040- 24:38.440* :  The launch came two weeks after China launched its own robot space plane,
*24:38.440- 24:40.700* :  called Chen Long, or a divine dragon.
*24:41.280- 24:44.400* :  The BBC's Nick Robinson has been speaking to Julianna Soos,
*24:44.400- 24:47.480* :  the policy lead for space, at the Think Tank, Rousey.
*24:48.060- 24:50.020* :  There is a whole lot we don't know about this programme.
*24:50.540- 24:53.160* :  This is now the seventh launch of X-37B.
*24:53.160- 24:54.560* :  It is a reusable spacecraft.
*24:55.260- 24:58.420* :  So you can kind of imagine it a little bit like NASA's space shuttle,
*24:58.500- 25:00.480* :  but a lot smaller and highly robotic.
*25:01.260- 25:03.600* :  We know that it usually operates in lower Earth orbit,
*25:03.600- 25:06.640* :  around between 340 kilometers up.
*25:07.300- 25:09.640* :  And we know that its mission now was to focus on
*25:09.920- 25:13.700* :  trying new orbital regimes, though the specific orbit is classified.
*25:13.740- 25:18.520* :  It will look at future space domain assessment technology,
*25:18.520- 25:22.860* :  which is very important considering our orbits are continuing to sort of fill up
*25:22.860- 25:24.060* :  with further further assets.
*25:24.640- 25:27.180* :  But it will also look at radiation effects on materials.
*25:28.040- 25:30.540* :  We know that there will be some seeds on board,
*25:30.540- 25:34.720* :  to sort of try and see the effect of sort of a long-term space mission
*25:35.180- 25:37.640* :  on seeds, which obviously may have an impact later on
*25:37.640- 25:41.300* :  if we are actually trying to explore further planets, etc.
*25:41.300- 25:46.300* :  Because actually X-37B last time stayed in orbit for nearly two and a half years.
*25:46.740- 25:49.620* :  We don't know quite how long it will be in orbit for this time,
*25:50.020- 25:51.940* :  but we know it will be a prolonged period of time.
*25:51.940- 25:54.520* :  I mentioned the Chinese had just launched one of their own.
*25:55.220- 25:57.240* :  Should we see this as part of the space race?
*25:57.400- 26:00.660* :  I think what we're seeing specifically when we talk about the spacecraft,
*26:00.780- 26:05.900* :  which obviously highly classified on them, both sides, both China and the US.
*26:06.040- 26:08.880* :  I think it's definitely part of the security dilemma we're seeing.
*26:09.520- 26:13.300* :  And I think the sort of classification level here is really helping.
*26:13.340- 26:17.680* :  We've seen a whole lot of conspiracy theories about what X-37B might be able to do,
*26:18.260- 26:21.260* :  given the sort of size and limited maneuverability of the spacecraft,
*26:21.260- 26:26.040* :  I think most of those conspiracy theories we can sort of reject straight away.
*26:26.560- 26:30.080* :  But I think the classification hasn't really helped in this.
*26:30.080- 26:33.480* :  And obviously, neither the US or China can sort of collaborate
*26:34.160- 26:35.120* :  substantively on space.
*26:35.500- 26:38.980* :  And that's because of the warfare amendment that was passed in the US in 2011,
*26:38.980- 26:43.640* :  which prohibits NASA from actually using government funds for collaboration with China.
*26:44.200- 26:47.560* :  And there's only been very specific allowances made to actually make collaboration
*26:47.560- 26:51.880* :  possible, for example, to allow monitoring of a Chinese moon lander.
*26:52.340- 26:53.900* :  Julianna Suis from Russia.
*26:54.660- 26:58.600* :  With Samo now in full swing in South Africa, many are heading to the beach for the holidays.
*26:58.600- 27:02.760* :  But there's concern with great white shark sightings on the rise
*27:02.760- 27:05.160* :  and a recent spike in fatal attacks.
*27:05.760- 27:10.120* :  The BBC has been examining the measures being taken to keep people and sharks apart,
*27:10.620- 27:12.600* :  while protecting both from harm.
*27:13.140- 27:15.740* :  Daniel Desemone sent us this report from Cape Town.
*27:17.380- 27:20.900* :  I'm on Musinburg Beach, which is one of the biggest beaches in Cape Town.
*27:21.060- 27:25.720* :  And there's lots of children in the sea, there's lots of families, surfers,
*27:26.280- 27:31.540* :  and there used to be a lot of sightings of great white sharks in this area.
*27:31.620- 27:37.400* :  But then there went several years where there weren't any sightings at all until a week ago.
*27:38.320- 27:40.540* :  So I think it's good that we're seeing a lot of natural life retaining.
*27:40.540- 27:43.780* :  In terms of the people's safety, I think obviously it can be a bit worrying.
*27:43.860- 27:46.080* :  I mean, who won't be worried? I think we got it on the control.
*27:46.240- 27:49.020* :  I don't like sharks, that's why I'm sitting on the beach always.
*27:49.760- 27:50.860* :  I don't go into the water.
*27:51.420- 27:53.680* :  So we know they are sharks, but we still swim.
*27:54.180- 27:56.480* :  We just tried to swim at beaches that we think are safe.
*27:57.060- 27:58.980* :  You should march in from Musinburg, march in over.
*28:02.440- 28:06.320* :  Watching from the surrounding mountainside is a team of professional sharks,
*28:07.280- 28:08.580* :  including Dennis Chakose.
*28:18.900- 28:22.240* :  A sighting means an alert and the sea cleared of swimmers.
*28:26.720- 28:32.960* :  Each morning the team seeks to create a safe bathing area of one beach with a 350 meter net.
*28:33.460- 28:36.160* :  It's placed down to the seabed and across the bay,
*28:36.660- 28:39.100* :  where there's previously been fatal shark attacks.
*28:43.500- 28:44.940* :  I joined the team in their boat.
*28:45.460- 28:49.200* :  Bathers bobbing up and down in the water on the safe side of the net.
*28:49.520- 28:52.760* :  And how close can the sharks come in in this bay we're in now?
*28:52.900- 28:54.720* :  No, like close, they're coming in, sure.
*28:54.720- 28:56.980* :  Like, where is deep already? They're coming close.
*28:57.800- 29:01.940* :  The net is lifted each evening to avoid injuring or killing sea life.
*29:04.720- 29:05.000* :  Ah!
*29:07.280- 29:13.300* :  At the coast at Plettinburg Bay, the shark spotters were called in after two fatal attacks last year.
*29:13.760- 29:17.080* :  They've since made over 70 great white shark sightings.
*29:18.180- 29:20.580* :  Head of the shark spotters is Sarah Varys.
*29:21.100- 29:25.520* :  And so when you have two fatalities in a short space of time in a short geographical area,
*29:25.520- 29:27.740* :  it can have really significant impact.
*29:27.740- 29:30.960* :  Social impact on economic and environmental.
*29:31.000- 29:33.400* :  And so putting measures in place like sharks,
*29:33.400- 29:36.200* :  but as increasing education is really important for those areas
*29:36.200- 29:37.540* :  that have been affected by shark bites.
*29:37.840- 29:40.500* :  I love this picture, that's why we put it on a mural.
*29:41.140- 29:45.800* :  One of those killed in Plettinburg Bay by a shark was Kimon Bisonio,
*29:46.240- 29:49.700* :  who ran a pizza restaurant with her partner Diego Melaise.
*29:50.200- 29:51.740* :  She was very bright.
*29:52.340- 29:54.760* :  Brighting personality, big smile on the face,
*29:56.300- 29:59.500* :  peaceful and kind and with a big big out.
*29:59.800- 30:03.220* :  She was the second person to die in the area last year.
*30:04.020- 30:06.680* :  Only then were shark spotting measures put in place.
*30:07.540- 30:09.560* :  Daniel Dismoon in South Africa.
*30:10.500- 30:14.540* :  Switzerland made back to clamp down on some high profile luxury consumption.
*30:14.540- 30:19.660* :  Voters will be asked to decide whether to ban imports of furs and patty de foie gras.
*30:20.240- 30:22.480* :  That's after campaigners handed in enough signatures
*30:22.480- 30:24.900* :  to trigger a public vote on the issues.
*30:25.500- 30:26.300* :  Let's tell you, you can report.
*30:27.080- 30:30.660* :  Boxes were piled up outside the Federal Palace Parliament buildings
*30:30.660- 30:31.960* :  in the capital Bern.
*30:31.960- 30:38.620* :  They symbolised well over 100,000 signatures each for initiatives on imports of foie gras
*30:39.020- 30:40.660* :  and on imports of fur.
*30:41.420- 30:44.980* :  Foie gras involves the force feeding of ducks and geese.
*30:45.360- 30:48.240* :  It's widely consumed around the December holiday season,
*30:48.680- 30:50.820* :  which gives the campaign extra resonance.
*30:51.640- 30:55.460* :  While such force feeding has been banned in Switzerland for more than 40 years,
*30:56.180- 30:58.760* :  importing produce derived from it is not,
*30:59.400- 31:01.440* :  and according to the Swiss Animal Alliance,
*31:01.440- 31:05.120* :  with 200 tons of foie gras imported annually,
*31:05.120- 31:08.900* :  Switzerland is one of the main importers of this product.
*31:09.740- 31:17.200* :  In fact, every year, 400,000 ducks and 12,000 geese are killed in order to meet the demand.
*31:18.220- 31:19.340* :  As for the vote on fur,
*31:19.700- 31:23.700* :  the Swiss Animal Alliance denounces methods of breeding and killing.
