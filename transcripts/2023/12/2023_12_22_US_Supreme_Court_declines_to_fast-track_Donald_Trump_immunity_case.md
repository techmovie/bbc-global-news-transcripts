*01:09.980- 01:13.460* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:14.880- 01:20.660* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Saturday, the 23rd of December, these are our main
*01:20.660- 01:26.320* :  stories. The US Supreme Court refuses to fast track a decision on whether Donald Trump can
*01:26.320- 01:31.720* :  be tried for federal crimes. The UN Security Council approves a watered-down resolution
*01:31.720- 01:39.000* :  i.e. to Gaza without a call for a suspension of hostilities. A plane carrying more than 300 Indian
*01:39.000- 01:44.360* :  nationals bound for Nicaragua has been grounded in France over suspected human trafficking.
*01:46.600- 01:54.800* :  Also in this podcast, most popular wobbles this year are Ukrainian defender the heart of Ukraine
*01:54.800- 02:00.740* :  and Hirson Watermelon. We made this one when our troops liberated Hirson.
*02:01.060- 02:05.680* :  We hear how Ukrainians are preparing for Christmas after switching from the Russian
*02:05.680- 02:14.700* :  to the Western festive calendar. The US Supreme Court has declined for now to decide whether
*02:14.700- 02:20.140* :  former president Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution for allegedly trying to overturn
*02:20.140- 02:26.920* :  the 2020 election. Mr. Trump's efforts to delay his trial appear successful as the case must
*02:26.920- 02:32.280* :  now work its way through the appeals process. Special counsel Jack Smith had asked the court to
*02:32.280- 02:38.360* :  take up the case in an expedited manner. I heard more from Gary O'Donohue, our Washington correspondent.
*02:39.300- 02:45.500* :  The special counsel Jack Smith, who's been tasked with taking this indictment to trial against
*02:45.500- 02:50.900* :  Donald Trump, he was asking the Supreme Court to say, look, we need to settle this question before
*02:50.900- 02:56.020* :  even a trial can go ahead. Otherwise, there's no point having a trial. Can the president be tried
*02:56.020- 03:02.320* :  for things he did while he was president? He wanted to get that decision made quickly because
*03:02.320- 03:07.680* :  eventually it would bubble up to the Supreme Court and he wanted to bypass one stage of that,
*03:07.680- 03:12.240* :  which is the appeals court. The Supreme Court has said, no, they haven't given any reasons,
*03:12.240- 03:18.060* :  they haven't said why. We don't know which way each of them voted, the nine justices, but it does
*03:18.060- 03:24.400* :  mean that there will now be a delay because this trial was due to start in March, but it does mean
*03:24.400- 03:28.580* :  there's going to be an extra stage where the appeals court hears it before the Supreme Court
*03:28.580- 03:36.260* :  will ultimately have to make a decision. So this could well not happen until after the presidential
*03:36.260- 03:42.280* :  election. It could have been a delay of two months, some say, three months, others say, and
*03:42.280- 03:47.800* :  bear in mind Donald Trump's strategy, legal strategy, is one of delay because, of course,
*03:47.800- 03:53.220* :  there is the very real possibility that even if he were convicted of federal crimes,
*03:53.220- 03:57.480* :  if he didn't get selected president, it's very real possibility he could pardon himself,
*03:57.900- 04:03.100* :  completely untested legally, but it's something that's one of those hot topic baiting issues around
*04:03.640- 04:07.820* :  the election. So he hopes all this goes away until after the election, in which case
*04:08.400- 04:12.720* :  any kind of trial would have to wait another four years while he was still president,
*04:13.220- 04:19.580* :  but if not, he wants it to go as close as possible to the election and become a part of the
*04:19.580- 04:24.640* :  political debate. And presumably his political opponents are going to be looking at the makeup
*04:24.640- 04:30.700* :  of the US Supreme Court. Well, we know that there's a conservative majority on that courts, six,
*04:30.720- 04:36.120* :  three, three of those were appointed by Donald Trump. It's meant to make an unbiased judgment
*04:36.120- 04:42.080* :  on the basis of the constitutional arguments, and that's what it will be asked to do, but there is no
*04:42.080- 04:48.880* :  question that the complexion of the court does matter when it comes to deciding not just the big
*04:48.880- 04:53.900* :  sort of social issues of the day, as we've seen with things like abortion rights and LGBTQ
*04:53.980- 05:00.900* :  rights, et cetera, but also these political moments as well. This call doesn't always go his way.
*05:01.240- 05:06.800* :  Let's be clear about that, but I think he feels that he will stand a good chance in front of them.
*05:07.380- 05:09.440* :  Gary O'Donohue in Washington.
*05:10.520- 05:16.380* :  After days of intense negotiations, postponements and amendments, a resolution intended to boost
*05:16.420- 05:22.720* :  aid into Gaza has finally been passed by the UN Security Council in New York. Supported by the
*05:22.720- 05:28.860* :  United States, the resolution does not answer global calls for a ceasefire. Instead, it asks for what
*05:28.860- 05:34.420* :  has been described as urgent steps to allow desperately needed humanitarian relief into the Palestinian
*05:34.420- 05:40.900* :  territory. Ambassador Lana Zaki Nasabah is the representative of the United Arab Emirates,
*05:40.900- 05:47.940* :  which proposed the resolution. She said they had visited Rafa in Gaza and saw the hell unleashed
*05:47.940- 05:54.280* :  there following the Hamas attacks on Israel. Half of the people of Gaza are now starving.
*05:54.280- 06:01.040* :  The UN has reported that the proportion of people hungry in Gaza is higher than any country
*06:01.040- 06:09.340* :  in any conflict in the last 20 years. Let's be clear, in the coming period, unless we take
*06:09.340- 06:16.900* :  drastic action, there will be famine in Gaza. The purpose of this text is very simple. It responds
*06:16.900- 06:22.580* :  with action to the dire humanitarian situation on the ground for the Palestinian people while
*06:22.580- 06:29.460* :  protecting those who are trying to deliver life-saving aid. The US vetoed the last vote on the 8th
*06:29.460- 06:35.040* :  of December. Today, 13 countries voted in favor, with Russia and the United States abstaining.
*06:35.040- 06:40.840* :  Israel's assault on Gaza by air and with soldiers on the ground was in response to the unprecedented
*06:40.840- 06:46.600* :  attack by Hamas in southern Israel on October the 7th, in which 1200 people were killed,
*06:46.600- 06:52.140* :  and some 250 others were taken hostage, around 130 are still being held.
*06:52.680- 06:58.220* :  Barbara Plattarsha, our US correspondent, has been giving me her assessment of the significance of
*06:58.220- 07:04.360* :  the resolution. On the one hand, the resolution doesn't have any teeth. The one thing that would have
*07:04.360- 07:10.020* :  given it teeth was a call for a cessation of hostilities in order for the aid to be delivered,
*07:10.020- 07:16.400* :  and that was taken out of the draft, because the US would not support that. Because of that,
*07:16.400- 07:21.220* :  some of the sponsors, Jordan and Algeria, withdrew their names. They felt it wouldn't have any impact.
*07:21.880- 07:27.200* :  On the other hand, given the dynamics on the ground, given that there was no way that the US would
*07:27.200- 07:32.740* :  support a ceasefire, given that the UN is saying that Gazans are in danger of starvation. I think
*07:32.740- 07:37.440* :  there was a strong feeling on the council to try to do what they could to push diplomatically,
*07:37.440- 07:44.160* :  at least, to get more aid into Gaza. And so the feeling there is that the effectiveness of what
*07:44.160- 07:49.720* :  has happened will be judged by the coming weeks. How much can they actually increase and accelerate
*07:49.720- 07:55.020* :  the aid into Gaza? As you say, no specific call for a cessation of hostilities, but there is
*07:55.640- 08:00.860* :  this call for creating the conditions for a cessation of hostilities. What does that mean?
*08:01.520- 08:05.420* :  Well, we don't know exactly. It wasn't spelled out at all. I think it's probably deliberately vague
*08:06.160- 08:11.300* :  because of the objections of the Americans and the Israelis to a call for a ceasefire. They have
*08:11.300- 08:17.340* :  supported a ceasefire if it's related to a specific thing, like getting hostages out of Gaza,
*08:17.340- 08:22.420* :  or like a humanitarian pause for a brief period, but they don't want in any way to have an end of
*08:22.420- 08:27.840* :  hostilities that would prevent Israel from trying to destroy the military capability of Hamas.
*08:28.100- 08:32.320* :  But there's strong pressure, as we all know, from much of the rest of the United Nations to stop
*08:32.320- 08:36.460* :  the hostilities, to have a ceasefire. And so this is as close as they were able to get.
*08:36.820- 08:41.660* :  Some council members did note it's the first time those words have actually appeared in a
*08:41.660- 08:47.860* :  resolution cessation of hostilities. So there is that. Barbara, can I play you this clip? It's
*08:47.860- 08:55.320* :  Palestine's ambassador to the UN Read Mansour. This resolution is a step in the right direction.
*08:55.320- 09:02.640* :  It must be implemented and must be accompanied by massive pressure for an immediate ceasefire.
*09:02.640- 09:07.940* :  I repeat, immediate ceasefire. There is no way to stop the war crimes,
*09:08.960- 09:14.340* :  crimes against humanity, and genocide underway, but an immediate ceasefire.
*09:15.180- 09:19.340* :  Barbara, the Israeli ambassador has also been speaking. What did he have to say?
*09:20.540- 09:26.860* :  He was quite critical. He said that the UN's focusing only on aid mechanisms to Gaza was
*09:26.860- 09:31.980* :  unnecessary, it was disconnected from reality. He claimed that Israel is already allowing aid
*09:31.980- 09:36.560* :  deliveries in at the required scale, and that the UN should focus more on the humanitarian
*09:36.560- 09:41.320* :  crisis of the hostages. And the resolution does mention hostages. Now, I should add that one of
*09:41.320- 09:45.800* :  the main sticking points in these long negotiations this week was over whether the UN could set up a
*09:45.800- 09:51.720* :  mechanism to monitor aid going into Gaza to speed up the amount of aid getting into the strip.
*09:51.720- 09:55.480* :  Because right now, trucks have to go into Israel to get inspected by the Israelis,
*09:55.480- 09:58.920* :  but the Israelis objected because they didn't want to be taken out of the screening cycle,
*09:59.260- 10:02.800* :  and the Americans supported on that, them on that. And what the ambassador, the Israeli ambassador
*10:02.800- 10:08.300* :  said, he thanked the US for what he said was maintaining Israel's security authority to inspect aid.
*10:08.300- 10:14.340* :  Barbara Plett, Usher, and Hamas is reported to have said that it considers the resolution to be
*10:14.340- 10:22.120* :  an insufficient step in meeting Gaza's requirements. On Friday, a plane carrying more than 300 Indian
*10:22.120- 10:28.080* :  nationals was grounded in Northeastern France after it stopped for refueling. The Airbus A340
*10:28.080- 10:33.320* :  had taken off from the United Arab Emirates and was heading for Nicaragua. French authorities
*10:33.320- 10:38.740* :  said the passengers were likely to be victims of human trafficking. But as Julian Marshall has
*10:38.740- 10:44.820* :  been hearing from Manuel Roscoe of the Inter-American Dialogue, a US-based think tank that focuses
*10:45.340- 10:51.680* :  on Latin America and the Caribbean, it may not be that simple. There has been some argument about
*10:51.680- 10:57.920* :  possible human trafficking, but most likely it's simply people taking advantage of using Nicaragua
*10:58.440- 11:03.380* :  as a part of entry to come to United States by land. And it's not a new phenomenon,
*11:03.380- 11:08.840* :  it's been going on for several months from different nationalities. The one most known was
*11:08.840- 11:14.460* :  Haitians going from Porto-Prince on charter flights to Managua, but also there was also charter
*11:14.460- 11:21.200* :  flights from provincialists into Managua from different nationalities, including Indians and people
*11:21.200- 11:27.000* :  of the African continent. So you're saying that these people are heading to the United States.
*11:27.860- 11:33.320* :  Why does Nicaragua allow them into the country? The Nicaragua government has an ideological
*11:33.460- 11:38.380* :  controversy with the United States, it's despised the United States as an enemy country,
*11:38.940- 11:45.180* :  and it has weaponized migration as a way to send migrants into the border and increase the problem
*11:45.180- 11:52.480* :  of the current migration crisis that's going on. So far, since early this year, at least 100,000
*11:52.480- 11:58.500* :  passengers have arrived on charter flights through Managua coming to the United States
*11:58.500- 12:04.100* :  border with Mexico. So companies have been negotiating with the Nicaraguan governments
*12:04.720- 12:07.380* :  to perform these charter flights on a regular basis.
*12:08.320- 12:12.380* :  I mean, you say that these are not victims of human trafficking that, you know,
*12:12.380- 12:18.820* :  they're obviously know what they're doing going to Nicaragua on route for the United States,
*12:18.820- 12:24.980* :  but there must be some organization behind this. There is definitely a network of service
*12:24.980- 12:31.420* :  provisions for personal transportation into Managua. So in some way, you can consider it a
*12:31.420- 12:37.940* :  form of human trafficking, but people are taking the opportunity to do that. But in the case of
*12:37.940- 12:44.000* :  Indians, there was evidence that there were direct flights coming from Europe, from Spain in
*12:44.000- 12:50.600* :  particular, into San Salvador for over the past six months. So there is a switching to routes,
*12:50.600- 12:56.920* :  perhaps because Nicaragua offered a better opportunity to the companies and to the passengers
*12:56.920- 13:03.900* :  that were part of the flying. Manuel Arosco of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank.
*13:05.200- 13:10.620* :  Japan has announced that it will send Patriot air defense missiles to the United States after
*13:10.620- 13:16.060* :  relaxing rules on defense exports. Japan's pacifist constitution has, until now,
*13:16.060- 13:21.900* :  precluded Tokyo's small defense industry, selling equipment abroad. The government is trying to
*13:21.900- 13:27.220* :  boost its military in the face of an assertive China. Will Leonardo from our news desk has more?
*13:27.820- 13:32.420* :  This is a big move for Japan, which has had up to now a relatively small defense industry,
*13:32.960- 13:37.620* :  kind of mostly with domestic focus. Remember, Japan has a pacifist constitution,
*13:37.620- 13:41.860* :  put in place after its defeat in the Second World War. Until 10 years ago, it couldn't export
*13:41.860- 13:47.320* :  any defense products. It was changed then to be able to export parts, and now they can export
*13:47.320- 13:52.820* :  full, fully produced products back to countries that hold the original patent of the product.
*13:52.880- 13:57.120* :  So in this case, we're talking about US-patented Patriot air defense missiles.
*13:57.840- 14:02.320* :  They're going to be sent, according to the foreign ministry of Japan, to the US. The US, of course,
*14:02.320- 14:06.800* :  has been sending its stocks of the Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine to help in the war
*14:07.760- 14:14.760* :  against Russia. And this, and this, of course, has been welcomed by the US. The US Reaction
*14:14.760- 14:19.880* :  has been swift and positive. The ambassador to Japan, Rahm Immanuel, called it historic. The
*14:19.880- 14:24.880* :  Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, has said it will contribute to the security of
*14:24.880- 14:29.520* :  Japan and the stability of the Indo-Pacific region as well. And that's also the context of this.
*14:29.520- 14:34.100* :  It's not just the war in Ukraine. Japan's been playing catch-up to various security
*14:34.100- 14:39.040* :  threats in the region, especially from an enormous sort of China, and it wants to boost
*14:39.040- 14:42.560* :  its own defense industry, which, as I said, has been relatively small until now.
*14:42.900- 14:46.240* :  On the same day that this wall change was announced, and it was announced that these
*14:46.240- 14:50.460* :  poacher missiles were going to be shipped to the US, the Japanese government approved a record
*14:50.460- 14:56.660* :  defense budget for next year of $56 billion. That's 16% increase compared to last year.
*14:57.060- 15:01.980* :  And it shows that while Japan remains normally a pacifist country, in practice, it's being forced
*15:01.980- 15:06.860* :  to stretch that definition because of what it considers to be the growing insecurity in the
*15:06.860- 15:13.600* :  region that it sits in. Well, Leonardo, Ukraine is fighting Russia for a second festive season,
*15:13.600- 15:19.740* :  but for the first time in more than a century, Christmas will be celebrated on December the 25th.
*15:19.920- 15:25.420* :  In a snub to Moscow, the country's main Christian Orthodox church has switched from the Russian
*15:25.420- 15:32.140* :  holiday of January the 7th. Our correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse, has been asking Ukrainians
*15:32.140- 15:36.600* :  young and old how they are preparing for Christmas this year.
*15:40.340- 15:46.760* :  Thankfully for these children, Christmas comes in wall or piece. At this decoration shop in
*15:46.760- 15:53.040* :  the outskirts of Kiev, they can paint their own ballroom. The shape of them reflects the times
*15:53.040- 16:03.740* :  they are growing up. So what's your most popular? Most popular bobbles this year are Ukrainian
*16:03.740- 16:11.180* :  defender, the hut of Ukraine and Hirsson Watermelon. We made this one when our troops liberated
*16:11.180- 16:22.220* :  Hirsson last year. Those patriotic decorations are made here at this old factory in the town of
*16:22.220- 16:29.920* :  Clevdyevov Tatosovic, not far from Ukraine's capital. For me, Christmas is the best holiday of the
*16:29.920- 16:36.420* :  year, but now there is the war. We used to have many visitors, many excursions. It was very interesting.
*16:36.620- 16:43.500* :  Now it's stopped. Production halted when this area was occupied by the Russians for a month
*16:43.660- 16:48.220* :  early in the invasion. It since resumed, but nowhere near the level it did.
*16:50.700- 16:55.960* :  Five women are hand-painting bobbles and you are drawn to the theme, male and female soldiers,
*16:56.520- 17:02.400* :  the Ukrainian trident. Tamilla is painting a flag on a bobble of a Ukrainian tractor.
*17:06.040- 17:10.560* :  I think that everyone will take a look at such a bobble and will hope for the victory of our country
*17:13.780- 17:19.300* :  soon as she says. Her colleague, Hennia, admits the war has changed their life and work.
*17:20.380- 17:26.460* :  It's not easy to work, but you want to do your job because people always remain people and a
*17:26.460- 17:34.340* :  holiday is always a holiday. Ukraine's culture is being strengthened by Russia's aggression.
*17:34.400- 17:40.660* :  It's trying to distance itself. Anyway, it can and few places have experienced
*17:40.660- 17:47.660* :  that aggression more than butcher. This commuter town and hour or so from Kiev. We're outside
*17:48.640- 17:54.280* :  the church of St Andrew. Its golden domes are glistening in the winter sunlight.
*17:55.520- 18:01.500* :  Until my right, there is a silver memorial where there was a makeshift mass grave for the
*18:01.500- 18:07.840* :  civilians who were gunned down by Russian forces as they tried to advance on Ukraine's capital.
*18:11.540- 18:15.280* :  In the silent candlelit crypt, we meet Father Andrei.
*18:16.780- 18:21.780* :  The fact is that we've now changed the calendar and celebrate Christmas and other holidays
*18:21.780- 18:27.880* :  with Europe and it's not shifting away from Russia. It is us returning back to Europe where we
*18:27.880- 18:35.720* :  belong. Could you ever forgive Russia? God forgives a sinner, but not all the sinners
*18:35.980- 18:40.100* :  and of those who repent, so I think it's too early to talk about forgiveness.
*18:42.540- 18:47.440* :  For Ukraine, any sign of Russian repentance would have to be accompanied with an ending of its
*18:47.440- 18:55.260* :  invasion. There is still zero sign of that happening. James Waterhouse in Kiev.

*20:09.000- 20:15.460* :  Christmas song and why do the old tunes do the best. The global story brings you fresh takes

*20:30.660- 20:32.100* :  Next to Niger.
*20:38.260- 20:43.680* :  Where the last French troops have flown from the West African country after a decade of working
*20:43.680- 20:50.040* :  alongside local forces to tackle an Islamist insurgency. Army officers who seized power in July
*20:50.040- 20:55.620* :  made the French departure one of their key demands. France is also shutting its embassy which
*20:55.620- 21:00.600* :  was attacked by thousands of protesters in the wake of the coup. Niger's new rulers have been
*21:00.600- 21:06.680* :  accused of asking for support from the Wagner-Russian mercenary group to help them maintain order.
*21:07.040- 21:09.460* :  Here's our regional correspondent Thomas Nadie.
*21:19.580- 21:26.160* :  As the French troops left a lot of people, some residents in Niami were very excited about this.
*21:26.560- 21:33.400* :  Several eight-hour half-dice security implications for Niger and the Sahil region. The French forces
*21:33.400- 21:40.340* :  supported the Niger army training them and then also helping them with combat machines and
*21:40.340- 21:48.180* :  intelligence sharing. They also provided support to civilians fleeing jihad attacks in the Sahil
*21:48.440- 21:52.620* :  region. Now that they are gone, there's going to be a security void. We do know that the Americans
*21:52.620- 22:00.920* :  are there. The U.S. has its second largest military base in Africa in Niger. But their operations
*22:00.920- 22:08.020* :  are severely limited because of the military coup. Now, what we have seen is an increase in attacks
*22:08.020- 22:14.780* :  by the Islamist groups in that region. And it remains to be seen whether they recently formed
*22:14.780- 22:22.140* :  alliance between Niger, Burakina, Faso and Mali with vagueness involvement will be able to
*22:22.140- 22:28.620* :  resolve the situation. France deployed its troops to Niger to play a supportive role and they did
*22:28.620- 22:35.060* :  that effectively. But of course, expectations were very high and then they couldn't manage to
*22:35.060- 22:40.780* :  meet those expectations. So the military leaders that came into power decided to capitalize on that
*22:40.900- 22:44.480* :  and they repart antiface sentiments to get them out of the region.
*22:46.940- 22:53.120* :  Now, how do you get rid of space junk? It's a growing problem with thousands of defunct satellites
*22:53.120- 22:59.160* :  orbiting the earth posing some pretty obvious dangers. Early on Friday, NASA released images of
*22:59.160- 23:04.620* :  the International Space Station getting rid of its waste material by deliberately sending a small
*23:04.620- 23:11.300* :  spacecraft on a reentry path where it's incinerated in the earth's atmosphere. So, is this the
*23:11.300- 23:18.660* :  best way of getting rid of around 25,000 bits of space junk that NASA estimates are out there?
*23:19.100- 23:24.160* :  Matthew and Rollerwoller heard more from the UK Space Agency's professor Malcolm McDonald.
*23:25.140- 23:29.460* :  I think I'm very reliable way to do it and it's something that when we only had a few spacecraft,
*23:29.460- 23:33.440* :  we had to get rid of them, we had to get rid of them out of orbit. This is a safe and reliable way.
*23:33.640- 23:37.840* :  What's changed over the last few years is we're now moving from a time where we had, you know,
*23:37.840- 23:43.400* :  a few hundred satellites in orbit to launch thousands of satellites per year. And what that means
*23:43.400- 23:48.260* :  is that in five, six, seven years, we're going to have thousands and thousands of satellites per year
*23:48.260- 23:53.640* :  burning up in the atmosphere. Now, we already see things in the atmosphere from launch vehicles.
*23:53.640- 23:58.780* :  We already see traces of small elements of satellites that have burned up in the past. So, there is
*23:59.220- 24:03.460* :  a suggestion that it's there. And ultimately, these particles, they might be small,
*24:03.460- 24:07.160* :  they might be high up in the atmosphere, but they will make their way down through the atmosphere.
*24:07.640- 24:12.760* :  And, well, again, we don't really know yet what effect they will have, whether they could enter,
*24:12.760- 24:16.960* :  you know, the food chain or anything else. It's all up for debate. It's all up for scientific study,
*24:16.960- 24:22.340* :  but something that we need to be thinking about. You talk about the large chunks, even the small
*24:22.340- 24:28.220* :  fragments of space junk. It's worth just describing to our viewers the dangers, because
*24:28.220- 24:35.440* :  even tiny, tiny pieces going at the velocity they go at when they're in space pose
*24:36.120- 24:41.280* :  huge dangers, both to the International Space Station and actually astronauts, if they potentially
*24:41.280- 24:46.100* :  were hit by even a very small fragment on a spacewalk. It really is the very small things are
*24:46.100- 24:50.620* :  actually the danger to other satellites, you know, but anything. If you've got a big satellite,
*24:50.620- 24:54.260* :  it's quite easy to see it. It's quite easy to know where it is and to determine where it's going.
*24:54.580- 24:58.700* :  But when you get really small things, you know, less than a centimeter, a few millimeters in size,
*24:59.340- 25:03.420* :  they're going just as quick, you know, they'll travel like a really fast bullet. They hit
*25:03.420- 25:07.880* :  your satellite, they'll just go straight through that satellite and they might just damage it,
*25:07.880- 25:11.720* :  they might chip a window on a space station or they might hit something really vital and just
*25:12.000- 25:16.780* :  destroy that spacecraft. And that's one of the real concerns that we've got that, you know,
*25:16.820- 25:22.280* :  are relatively small particles like that, hits a big satellite, that big satellite is a reservoir
*25:22.280- 25:27.840* :  of what's a small bits. And that then triggers some sort of cascade effect that takes out other
*25:27.840- 25:32.740* :  satellites. So again, that's why we're seeing this exponential growth in a number of satellites.
*25:33.120- 25:37.140* :  There's an increased risk of something going on just because we've not really taken the time
*25:37.140- 25:41.340* :  to think about it. We've not got the regulation in place. The technology is running ahead of that.
*25:41.580- 25:45.980* :  There's all sorts of geopolitical things going on as well about strategic advantage of being in
*25:45.980- 25:50.040* :  space that's holding back the regulation. So it's a whole world of things coming together to make
*25:50.040- 25:54.680* :  it really difficult to understand and control what we do and make sure that we have a sustainable
*25:54.680- 26:02.200* :  environment. Professor Malcolm McDonald from the UK Space Agency. Now, to a piece of research in
*26:02.200- 26:07.580* :  which scientists have been trying to work out where the human language evolved when our ancestors
*26:08.120- 26:14.100* :  moved from living entries to living in Africa's open grasslands when the forests turned to Savannah
*26:14.460- 26:18.880* :  millions of years ago as a result of climate change. And they've been testing the theory
*26:19.320- 26:22.260* :  using these sounds from orangutans.
*26:29.300- 26:34.540* :  Charlotte Ganon's from the University of Warwick. She led the research. James Menendez asked
*26:34.540- 26:41.600* :  her to explain what those sounds meant. You listened there to a kiss squeak and a grump.
*26:42.020- 26:47.660* :  So the first part of it was the kiss squeak, the part that we refer to as a proto-consonant
*26:48.040- 26:53.280* :  and the grump is the second part. That's what we call a proto-val. They're often made by the
*26:53.280- 26:59.080* :  orangutans in combination, a bit like an alarm call. What did you then do as part of your research
*26:59.080- 27:06.220* :  with those sounds? Those sounds were originally recorded in Borneo and Sumatra from various
*27:06.220- 27:12.340* :  different populations. They were then played across the Savannah in South Africa. We were really
*27:12.340- 27:19.480* :  interested in looking at how the shift from the dense forests to open landscapes that are
*27:19.480- 27:25.700* :  early ancestors will have gone through. What role that played in language? So we were really
*27:25.700- 27:31.460* :  interested to see how far these calls would travel. And how far did they travel and did the
*27:31.460- 27:36.800* :  consonants travel further than the vowel sounds? All the way up to 400 metres. A good majority
*27:36.800- 27:42.820* :  about 80% of the consonant-based calls were still audible, whereas only about 20% of those
*27:42.820- 27:47.580* :  vowel-like calls remained audible. And were you surprised by that because one might think that
*27:47.580- 27:52.280* :  the vowel sounds, especially a long vowel sound, that that would sustain for longer and therefore
*27:52.280- 27:58.560* :  be heard more easily from a distance? We actually expected the vowel-like calls to travel further
*27:59.220- 28:04.160* :  because they're lower frequency and the kiss squeaks are higher frequency. We actually found
*28:04.160- 28:08.320* :  the reverse in this situation. Just explain a little bit more about what that tells us about
*28:08.320- 28:14.940* :  human evolution or the evolution of our ancestors anyway. Obviously, orangutans, they're not a
*28:14.940- 28:19.860* :  direct ancestor of ours. We're more looking at them as a bit of a parallel to sort of understand
*28:19.860- 28:25.560* :  a bit more about what happened to our language. Maybe this landscape change did have an effect
*28:25.580- 28:30.600* :  and this is why we then ended up merging with such a consonant-heavy-based language.
*28:31.180- 28:35.920* :  And am I right in thinking that humans are unique in that sense? We're the only species to have,
*28:35.920- 28:42.360* :  not only this language capacity, but it's so rich, we have this massive, limitless space of
*28:42.360- 28:46.420* :  language, we look all around the world and we just have so many different variations,
*28:46.420- 28:52.320* :  but it's still only unique to just us humans. And so what next with this research? I mean, how will
*28:52.320- 28:57.320* :  you sort of firm it up further or are we always going to be dealing in the realms of speculation
*28:57.320- 29:02.420* :  to some extent, you think? Well, obviously, the issue with language is it doesn't fossilise,
*29:02.800- 29:08.160* :  so it's one of those ones where we do have to kind of always have a bit of a theory-based approach
*29:08.160- 29:16.720* :  to it and it's why great apes are valuable to our story of language. Charlotte Ganon from Warwick
*29:16.720- 29:22.800* :  University. The operator of a train used in the Harry Potter films is considering its future
*29:22.800- 29:29.600* :  after it lost a court battle over safety. As Olivia O'Tayba reports, fans visit Scotland for
*29:29.600- 29:35.620* :  the ride of a lifetime. Fans have been able to ride the same train as a boy wizard by stepping
*29:35.620- 29:41.400* :  onto the locomotive and carriages used in the films. The Jacobites seam train in Scotland
*29:41.500- 29:48.080* :  rides between Fort William to Malig twice a day from March to October and is widely regarded as
*29:48.080- 29:53.800* :  one of the most scenic real journeys in the world. However, West Coast Railways, the company which
*29:53.800- 29:59.440* :  operates the journey, has just lost a high court battle to a rail regulator over doors safety.
*30:00.060- 30:05.620* :  The company took legal action against the Office of Rail and Road, the ORR, after it refused to
*30:05.620- 30:10.340* :  grant an exemption to a ban on the use of hinge doors without a central locking system.
*30:10.920- 30:15.860* :  West Coast Railways claims that implementing the measures to 1950s slammed or carriages
*30:15.860- 30:22.360* :  with cost up to $9 million. Around 100,000 journeys are made on the light each year,
*30:22.880- 30:28.180* :  but despite this, a judge dismissed the case citing instances where a lack of central locking
*30:28.180- 30:34.140* :  had compromised passenger and door safety. The ORR stress said it had no intention of
*30:34.140- 30:39.340* :  putting heritage train operators out of business, but expected companies to meet minimum safety
*30:39.860- 30:44.580* :  standards. West Coast Railways said that safety was its top priority and that it would consider
*30:44.620- 30:49.160* :  its options. Perhaps a little Harry Potter magic will keep the service running.
