*01:48.940- 01:51.880* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:53.940- 01:59.160* :  I'm Robin Brandt, and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 7th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:59.740- 02:05.080* :  Israel's military is focusing on the main city in southern Gaza, as it believes it surrounded
*02:05.080- 02:10.640* :  the home of a Hamas leader. China is hosting EU leaders in a major meeting aimed at resetting
*02:10.640- 02:15.160* :  their relationship, and the UK government has accused Russia of intercepting conversations
*02:15.280- 02:18.900* :  between senior politicians in a campaign going back to 2015.
*02:21.720- 02:25.540* :  Also in this podcast we hear from young festival goers dealing with the trauma
*02:25.540- 02:34.560* :  of the October 7th attacks in Israel. People here have seen tremendous amount of pain.
*02:35.700- 02:38.960* :  Some of them were extremely close to not being here.
*02:42.500- 02:47.420* :  Now, Israeli troops and Hamas fighters are battling it out in southern Gaza's main city of
*02:47.420- 02:52.900* :  Hanyunis. According to the Israelis, that's where the Hamas chief Yaha Sinwa is in hiding,
*02:52.900- 02:58.580* :  along with other leaders of the group, regarded by the US, UK and other governments as terrorists.
*02:59.360- 03:04.260* :  But as it pursues its military aims, there is still a lot of pressure on just how Israel
*03:04.260- 03:10.300* :  conducts its operations. Although Israel advised civilians to flee to Rafa City recently,
*03:10.300- 03:14.520* :  it's carried out airstrikes there. Here's the World Health Organization's regional
*03:14.520- 03:19.220* :  emergency director, Dr. Richard Brennan. We do need to protect the health system as the military
*03:19.220- 03:25.040* :  offensive proceeds, the three main hospitals in the south. In particular, they have to be protected.
*03:25.660- 03:32.200* :  Patients have to be assured access to those hospitals and the supply lines must be guaranteed.
*03:32.200- 03:37.580* :  We absolutely plead for sustaining the availability of health services.
*03:38.180- 03:42.980* :  Well, our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda Nell, told us more about the situation in Hanyunis
*03:42.980- 03:48.340* :  and the search for Yaha Sinwa. They believe that he and other leaders of Hamas will be an
*03:48.340- 03:54.480* :  underground tunnels at this stage that they have long retreated there. But they are continuing to
*03:54.480- 03:59.780* :  battle a lot of Hamas fighters, Israeli forces, in Hanyunis, the biggest city in the south of the
*03:59.780- 04:05.100* :  Gaza Strip. And we have had images from the Israeli military too, which show that they have
*04:05.100- 04:09.960* :  been targeting tunnels as part of that effort. They say they killed at least two militants who
*04:09.960- 04:16.400* :  emerged firing missiles, rocket propelled grenades from a tunnel. We've seen other fighting
*04:16.400- 04:22.720* :  taking place in big cities across the Gaza Strip. And, you know, Palestinian health officials say
*04:22.720- 04:28.880* :  in Israeli airstrike did kill people in a house in Nusrat refugee camp. It's in the center of
*04:28.880- 04:35.580* :  Gaza overnight down in Raffa on the border with Egypt. That's where people have really been
*04:35.580- 04:41.140* :  cramming in. They had Israeli leaflets dropped and messages saying they'd be safe if they headed
*04:41.140- 04:47.200* :  south towards the border with Egypt. But Palestinian medics and you can see some really grim footage
*04:47.200- 04:52.480* :  of it. People saying that Israeli airstrikes in Raffa killed 17 people in one house there.
*04:52.480- 04:56.720* :  There's some horrible pictures of the bodies of two small children among those being brought out
*04:56.720- 05:05.040* :  of the rubble. So if we just take what you said there, to what extent in your analysis is Israel
*05:05.040- 05:09.440* :  and it's military living up to the pledges, we understand it made to the Biden administration in
*05:09.440- 05:14.480* :  particular, to be more measured in the military campaign, but also to make clear to Gaza's heading
*05:14.480- 05:18.840* :  south that there are safe places to go to. Yeah, I mean Israel says that it's being much more
*05:18.840- 05:25.440* :  precise in terms of how it asks people to evacuate from certain areas. Much more targeted,
*05:25.440- 05:31.100* :  it says it tries to minimize civilian casualties. But we have the UN's top aid official coming out
*05:31.540- 05:36.000* :  saying that the Israeli military campaign and southern Gaza has basically been just as devastating
*05:36.000- 05:42.760* :  as it was in the north. And now you have people squeezed into a pocket around Raffa. That makes
*05:42.760- 05:47.920* :  it really extremely difficult with the ongoing fighting to distribute the small land at aid that's
*05:47.920- 05:52.900* :  basically being allowed in. On top of that, as we know, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has
*05:52.900- 05:59.160* :  used this rare move is invoked article 99 at the UN Charter for the first time that allows him
*05:59.160- 06:03.700* :  to bring to the UN Security Council's attention threats to international peace and security and
*06:03.700- 06:08.960* :  is basically saying in a letter that they need to act on the war in Gaza that it is a global threat.
*06:09.800- 06:15.660* :  Yolanda Elv reporting from Jerusalem. A meeting between China's leader, Xi Jinping and senior
*06:15.660- 06:21.740* :  European Union leaders has highlighted differences over trade, international affairs and human rights.
*06:22.400- 06:25.060* :  Here's Ursula Vonderle and the president of the European Commission.
*06:25.780- 06:33.580* :  We recalled the need for China to use all its influence on Russia to stop this war of aggression
*06:34.440- 06:43.080* :  and to engage in Ukraine's peace formula. We also reiterated to reframe from supply and lethal
*06:43.080- 06:51.440* :  equipment to Russia and to prevent any attempts by Russia to undermine the impact of sanctions.
*06:52.880- 06:58.780* :  Well, some it's like this involving this level of senior figures hasn't happened for four years.
*06:59.540- 07:02.860* :  This report from our China correspondent Steven McDonald who's impeaching.
*07:03.700- 07:10.420* :  Both sides have welcomed this chance to increase their dialogue. Xi Jinping even spoke about the
*07:10.420- 07:17.260* :  good momentum in terms of relations between China and Europe. But the differences between them
*07:17.260- 07:24.220* :  are stark. From the outset, the president of the European Commission put trade at the forefront
*07:24.940- 07:30.420* :  in the opening meeting with Xi Jinping. She spoke about the clear imbalances in trade between
*07:30.420- 07:36.180* :  Europe and China. Now, what this is all about is European companies are saying they can't get access
*07:36.180- 07:42.600* :  to the huge Chinese market because of these artificial impediments which have been put in place
*07:42.600- 07:48.560* :  by the Chinese government. For example, tariffs or local government support for the electric car
*07:48.560- 07:54.680* :  market here. They want to sell more European cars into China. Now, the Chinese government is saying
*07:54.680- 08:00.180* :  though this was a temporary measure just needed to get EVs off the ground in the first place.
*08:01.240- 08:07.460* :  Eventually, that will stop the point is when. Now, on the Chinese side, they're saying they don't
*08:07.460- 08:14.200* :  want there to be blockages in terms of the sale of say microchips. Now, the sale of chips is being
*08:14.200- 08:20.060* :  blocked because of supposed concerns that they're being used as part of China's military buildup.
*08:21.020- 08:27.180* :  China also has been pushing back against this talk of de-risking. European countries have been
*08:27.180- 08:33.480* :  burnt by their reliance on Russia. And so, to at least some extent, there's pressure in Europe to
*08:33.480- 08:40.400* :  not rely so much on China in case, well, there's another sort of a war involving Taiwan or
*08:40.400- 08:45.240* :  something along those lines which would mean that China can't be relied upon in the future.
*09:04.200- 09:08.880* :  Mexico. The Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who's a Democrat, warned of dire consequences.
*09:34.300- 09:38.200* :  Well, we spoke to our correspondent Jessica Parker, who's in Kiev for this update.
*09:39.160- 09:45.800* :  President Zelensky posted a video last night as he usually does. And I think trying to strike an
*09:45.800- 09:52.180* :  upbeat note by saying that he remains very thankful. And he was also talking about this in his
*09:52.180- 09:58.360* :  address to G7 leaders yesterday for Western support. But the kind of message that you do also get
*09:58.360- 10:06.340* :  from Zelensky and from those around him is, look, President Putin wants or hopes or expects
*10:06.340- 10:13.180* :  the West's will to support Ukraine too. Either collapse at some point or weaken, and that that's
*10:13.180- 10:18.380* :  what he's waiting for and the underlying message, therefore, is, you know, please the West prove him wrong.
*10:19.140- 10:25.420* :  In terms of more, I mean, direct reaction. The Ukrainian ambassador to the US has been
*10:26.200- 10:32.000* :  posting some messages about this and she's saying that senators have assured her that today's vote
*10:32.000- 10:38.020* :  wasn't against Ukraine, but domestic political events are to some extent dictating what's
*10:38.020- 10:43.260* :  happening at the moment in terms of this aid. But clearly, this is not a great situation to be
*10:43.260- 10:49.080* :  in. It's about a week until the Senate is due to finish before Christmas. So the window to get
*10:49.080- 10:54.400* :  this aid package passed is closing. Can we just talk briefly about how important US funding is
*10:54.400- 10:57.740* :  for Ukraine? I mean, I know Ukraine gets hardware from other governments, it gets money from
*10:57.740- 11:02.340* :  other governments, the EU as well. But this is tens of billions from the US and the US is the
*11:02.340- 11:07.320* :  biggest donor. How important is that funding for the war effort? Yeah, I mean, the biggest
*11:07.320- 11:15.960* :  area by a country mile, and I think obviously a key member of NATO as well, the defensive alliance.
*11:15.960- 11:24.260* :  So the USA has seen as crucial to the Ukrainian war effort. Ukraine is trying to send a message out
*11:24.260- 11:28.880* :  to say, look, we're not just coming around with a begging bowl every few months. We want to do more,
*11:28.880- 11:34.840* :  defence cooperation, boost our own domestic production of arms as well. But I don't think anyone
*11:34.840- 11:39.100* :  thinks that suddenly if the taps were turned off overnight from the West or indeed from the US
*11:39.100- 11:43.900* :  that Ukraine would be able to make up for that in the short term. So it is seen as essential. And
*11:43.900- 11:49.040* :  if you go out and talk to people in the streets of Kiev, they're very clear that they feel that
*11:49.040- 11:54.720* :  not only does the West need to send them weapons, but they feel they are fighting a war that
*11:54.720- 11:59.960* :  represents the interests of the free world and so that there's a moral justification as to the
*11:59.960- 12:05.900* :  requests that they are making. But it's difficult because I mean, there's also some concern about
*12:05.900- 12:11.460* :  whether EU assistance, financial assistance is in trouble ahead of a summit next week. So I think
*12:11.580- 12:15.060* :  when you look at all the different factors for Ukraine at the moment as it heads into winter,
*12:15.640- 12:20.440* :  these are some pretty challenging times for them. Jessica Parker in Kiev. Now let's stay on
*12:20.440- 12:24.860* :  matters related to Russia because the UK government has accused the country's security service,
*12:24.860- 12:31.800* :  the FSB, of intercepting conversations between senior British politicians and carrying out wider
*12:31.800- 12:36.700* :  cyber hacking activities. The foreign office based here in London said it was part of a campaign
*12:36.700- 12:42.760* :  to disrupt what it called the democratic process in the UK. It's believed that the SFB has been
*12:42.760- 12:48.640* :  stealing information from politicians and public figures since 2015. Our security correspondent
*12:48.640- 12:54.520* :  Gordon Carrera told us more. A particular centre of the FSB has been involved in trying to get into
*12:54.520- 13:01.160* :  the personal emails of public figures. This includes members of parliament, civil servants,
*13:01.160- 13:07.180* :  people from think tanks and that it's done that on a number of occasions and in some cases leaked
*13:07.180- 13:12.460* :  that information and it's emerged into the public domain, the aim being to undermine the democratic
*13:12.460- 13:17.220* :  process, something which the UK says it hasn't been successful in doing. This is something that's
*13:17.220- 13:22.140* :  alleged to have gone on for a few years. Previous accusations have been there that for instance some
*13:22.140- 13:27.880* :  documents were leaked and then used in the context of the 2019 general election, Russia had been
*13:27.880- 13:32.320* :  accused in the past. It's the first time that this particular group has been in accused and
*13:32.860- 13:39.900* :  an array of different activities of hacking activities have all been placed in the territory of
*13:39.900- 13:44.980* :  this one group as being responsible. Haven't been successful in getting this information or
*13:44.980- 13:47.760* :  haven't been successful in the assessment of the British Government in undermining the
*13:47.760- 13:51.300* :  democratic process? They've been successful in getting the information and my understanding is
*13:51.300- 13:55.100* :  they've got a lot of information. They've actually hacked into a number of people's emails.
*13:55.900- 14:01.280* :  I've spoken in the past to one member of parliament who said who believed that all his personal
*14:01.280- 14:07.720* :  emails were stolen, but in that case they weren't put into the public domain and the argument
*14:07.720- 14:12.380* :  from the British Government is that none of this had a significant impact on politics and on
*14:12.380- 14:17.440* :  political life and interference. Russia of course has consistently denied these claims that it's
*14:17.440- 14:22.480* :  involved in such hacking activity. And just quickly, going forward, is this information being
*14:22.480- 14:26.660* :  put out there by the British Government now with a night on the UK general election that's
*14:26.660- 14:30.660* :  due in roughly a year or are there other serious concerns about that going forward?
*14:30.780- 14:34.760* :  Yeah, I think this is about a couple of things and one of them is certainly that there is a
*14:34.760- 14:39.520* :  general election expected in around a year in the UK, but also a lot of elections in other countries,
*14:39.520- 14:45.260* :  including the US. And I think we can expect more on this from the United States in a few hours time.
*14:45.820- 14:50.320* :  That's what we're led to believe that this is if you like an attempt to coordinate a coordinated
*14:50.320- 14:55.260* :  pushback against this activity by the FSB with that knowledge that it's about disrupting that
*14:55.260- 15:00.300* :  group's activity and raising awareness with elections to come. Gordon Carrera, now the former
*15:00.300- 15:05.600* :  Austrian foreign minister, Karin Knaisel, who hit the headlines when she danced with Vladimir Putin
*15:06.060- 15:12.000* :  at her wedding in 2018 has moved to Russia. In an interview with the BBC, Ms Knaisel claimed that
*15:12.000- 15:17.020* :  political pressure had forced her out of Austria and she described President Putin as,
*15:17.020- 15:22.380* :  quote, the most intelligent gentleman. She was speaking in St Petersburg in what turned out to be a
*15:22.380- 15:25.680* :  rather unusual conversation to our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg.
*15:26.540- 15:31.680* :  Maybe if you wake him up from time to time, it's good. Winston, because then he wants to know,
*15:31.680- 15:36.440* :  we have one. This is one of the most surreal moments of my BBC career.
*15:37.180- 15:41.300* :  Instant Petersburg, I've just sat down to interview Karin Knaisel,
*15:41.900- 15:47.440* :  Austria's controversial former foreign minister who once danced to waltz with Vladimir Putin
*15:47.440- 15:53.440* :  and who has recently moved to Russia to run a think tank. I have so many questions,
*15:54.200- 15:58.220* :  but I didn't expect the first one to be, why is your dog snoring?
*15:59.580- 16:06.740* :  It's quite extraordinary. Does he do that a lot? Winston Churchill, her boxer, is snoozing loudly.
*16:07.620- 16:14.320* :  From time to time, I have to reach down and tickle Winston to rouse him from his slumber and
*16:14.320- 16:21.400* :  reduce the background noise. Here's some background on Karin Knaisel. She claims that when she left
*16:21.400- 16:29.120* :  political office in Austria in 2019, she couldn't find work because she was seen as too close to
*16:29.120- 16:35.960* :  the Kremlin. I wanted to restart my life as an analyst, as a university teacher and I had to
*16:35.960- 16:42.040* :  find out that there was not a single contract left. It was all about not being able to work and
*16:42.040- 16:49.640* :  that was political pressure. In spring this year, I received the offer by director of St. Petersburg
*16:49.640- 16:57.980* :  University to run an interdisciplinary institute, and I created the name Gorky, which is the acronym
*16:57.980- 17:03.440* :  for two political observatory for Russia's key issues. Do you understand that it is hugely
*17:03.440- 17:11.920* :  controversial for a former Austrian foreign minister to move to Russia at a time when this country
*17:11.920- 17:18.480* :  has launched an unprovoked false-scale invasion of its neighbor of Ukraine? Isn't there a danger
*17:18.480- 17:25.180* :  that by being here that you are legitimizing the invasion of the war and also the domestic
*17:25.180- 17:32.700* :  repression that takes place in Russia? Well, so far I have not seen any sort of repression
*17:32.780- 17:41.820* :  in my immediate surrounding. I can work here in a kind of academic freedom which I started
*17:41.820- 17:47.920* :  missing when I was still teaching at various universities in such a few days ago. In this city,
*17:47.920- 17:53.720* :  a young Russian woman was sent to prison for seven years for replacing some price tanks in a
*17:53.720- 18:00.220* :  suit market with anti-war slogans. Yeah, and so what do I have to do with that? I just explained
*18:00.240- 18:03.860* :  at Lams the situation that I've been going through.
*18:10.660- 18:17.400* :  This was the moment in 2018 that Karin Kanaisal hit the headlines. Then Austria's foreign
*18:17.400- 18:23.820* :  minister, she invited President Putin to her wedding. They shared a waltz, and then she
*18:23.820- 18:31.020* :  said to him, all this, just a few months after the Salisbury Novichok Poisonings, which the EU,
*18:31.020- 18:37.480* :  like Britain, had linked to the Russian state. By the time I passed President Putin, but you see,
*18:37.480- 18:42.700* :  I have done other things in my life before and after, and honestly, it's so boring, honestly,
*18:42.700- 18:47.940* :  it's very boring. To talk about the wedding? Yes, yes. There are other more interesting topics
*18:47.940- 18:54.560* :  we can discuss, honestly. I consider it as honestly boring, and the doctors fell asleep and
*18:54.560- 19:00.280* :  was snoring because he knows the topic. But what does Karin Kanaisal think of Vladimir Putin now?
*19:00.860- 19:07.460* :  He is the most intelligent gentleman with the focus on gentleman, and I met a few
*19:08.240- 19:13.720* :  in the sense of what Jane Austen wrote about the accomplished gentleman in pride and prejudice.
*19:13.720- 19:21.620* :  He amounts to these standards. This idea of President Putin as a sort of a Jane Austen gentleman
*19:21.660- 19:28.940* :  might surprise some. We're seeing a wave of repression domestically, and we've seen Russia invade
*19:28.940- 19:36.540* :  Ukraine. It's hard to classify that as a gentlemanly action. Well, Tony Blair, Cameron, they all were
*19:36.540- 19:42.320* :  involved with the government being involved in military actions. When the interview ends, Winston
*19:42.320- 19:48.800* :  wakes up and waxes tail. Perhaps it was my questions that had sent him to sleep. Anyway,
*19:49.280- 19:55.720* :  having met dog and owner, it seems to me that Winston Churchill and Karin Kanaisal have one
*19:55.760- 20:02.080* :  thing in common. They both seem quite comfortable in Russia. Steve Rosenberg.
*20:04.980- 20:09.500* :  Still to come in this podcast, a state of emergency has been declared in seashells after a
*20:09.500- 20:15.220* :  blast at a storage facility. Absolutely colossal damage by any measurement. What appears to have
*20:15.220- 20:21.280* :  happened is that there was a very large explosion in four storage containers containing explosives.
*20:22.180- 20:26.680* :  And it looks like scientists have discovered a new way of making an even better cup of coffee.
*20:31.800- 20:36.340* :  The global news podcast brings you the world's latest breaking news and developments,

*21:11.340- 21:16.440* :  Welcome back to this podcast, The Global News Podcast. One of Britain's most influential and
*21:16.440- 21:22.240* :  arresting poets has died. Benjamin Zephaniah was 65. His family said he'd been suffering
*21:22.240- 21:26.940* :  from a brain tumour for the last two months. He was known for writing and reciting in the
*21:26.940- 21:32.080* :  Patoire of the Caribbean community from which his parents came, challenging the norms of what was
*21:32.080- 21:37.580* :  considered poetry along the way. Our Europe Regional Editor Paul Moss has been looking back at his life.
*21:38.780- 21:42.920* :  I think you've got to remember how much our idea of poetry has changed. I mean, back when I was
*21:42.920- 21:47.340* :  at school, poetry meant Shakespeare, Sonnets and Wordsworth. And I'm going to be honest with you,
*21:47.340- 21:50.260* :  when our English teachers said, right, today we're doing poetry, they would be this
*21:50.820- 21:55.420* :  grown from the class. Now, I'm sure people will hear this and think we were a bunch of Philistines,
*21:55.420- 21:59.520* :  but it really isn't easy getting a bunch of 12-year-olds to care whether someone
*21:59.980- 22:04.700* :  wondered lonely as a cloud and then come the early 80s and a bunch of people shook the whole
*22:04.700- 22:10.760* :  thing up. They sought to make poetry, accessible fun, written in a language everyone could relate to.
*22:11.300- 22:15.420* :  Now, I'm not saying they were the first, but this was a concerted movement and it went on to go
*22:15.420- 22:19.480* :  right around the world. I mean, nowadays it's perfectly normal to hear about performance
*22:19.480- 22:25.300* :  poets everywhere from New York to Cape Town, even the far east. Benjamin Zephaniah was right at the
*22:25.300- 22:30.180* :  forefront of this and he did something else which now is considered normal, as well as giving
*22:30.180- 22:37.180* :  straight recitals, he also set his verse to music. We live in a world where they say we communicate more,
*22:38.160- 22:41.300* :  but the world's stage silent when the slave trade was making money.
*22:42.380- 22:48.040* :  The world's stage silent when the Nazis started to kill trade unionists, people with disabilities,
*22:48.700- 22:55.940* :  homosexuals, left-handed people and Jews. And now, in the age of the global village and mass
*22:55.940- 23:01.940* :  communications, the world is staying silent as the Palestinians are being annihilated.
*23:03.860- 23:08.380* :  Well, that is very distinctive, a very clear political message as well. Paul, what did Benjamin
*23:08.380- 23:12.920* :  Zephaniah have to say generally about Britain and also the wider world? Well, he came from an
*23:12.920- 23:18.380* :  immigrant background, father from Barbados, mother from Jamaica and the 1980s was a time of great
*23:18.380- 23:22.360* :  racial tension in Britain and indeed elsewhere, but particularly from the city of Birmingham,
*23:22.360- 23:26.840* :  where he was born and raised. Lots of his work was about this subject. You know, bear in mind,
*23:26.840- 23:31.640* :  this is a man who by his own account was pretty much a literate when he left school, got involved in
*23:31.640- 23:36.760* :  crime, went to prison for burglary. And yet still in his 20s, he's got a huge audience with work
*23:36.760- 23:41.340* :  speaking about this background and this culminated one of the most controversial things he did. He was
*23:41.340- 23:46.220* :  awarded one of Britain's greatest honours, the OBE, but that stands for the Order of the British
*23:46.220- 23:51.500* :  Empire. Well, Benjamin Zephaniah was no fan of the British Empire. He said he associated it with
*23:51.500- 23:57.060* :  slavery and conquest and he refused to accept the award, only a lot of criticism. Just before you
*23:57.060- 24:00.620* :  go, I mean, you make him sound like quite a serious and earnest character, but there was another
*24:00.620- 24:04.080* :  sight to him. Absolutely. I mean, look at pictures of the guy. He was always smiling. And yes,
*24:04.320- 24:07.520* :  he talked about racial tensions and things like that, but then he had a great comic tape
*24:07.520- 24:12.520* :  to take on life on. I'm particularly fond of his poetic plea, which is rather appropriate
*24:12.520- 24:17.720* :  at this time of year. Be nice to your turkey this Christmas, he wrote, because turkeys just
*24:17.740- 24:23.580* :  want to have fun. Turkeys are cool, turkeys are wicked, and every turkey has a mum.
*24:24.380- 24:29.540* :  Paul Moss on the work and life of Benjamin Zephaniah, who's died at the age of 65.
*24:31.000- 24:35.380* :  Dozens of people have been injured and a state of emergency declared after a massive explosion
*24:35.480- 24:41.420* :  in seashells. Nearby buildings and houses were flattened. The blast happened at an industrial
*24:41.420- 24:46.260* :  area just south of the capital, Victoria, on the nation's main island of Mahay.
*24:46.720- 24:51.780* :  Patrick Muahed is a journalist based on Mahay. I spoke to him and asked him to describe
*24:51.780- 24:57.500* :  the damage caused by the explosion. Absolutely colossal damage by any measurement. What appears
*24:57.500- 25:02.620* :  to have happened is that there was a very large explosion in four storage containers,
*25:02.620- 25:09.420* :  containing explosives at a quarrying company in the industrial area, the main part of the industrial
*25:09.420- 25:15.960* :  area of this island. That then created an enormous crater and a shockwave, which went
*25:16.420- 25:23.240* :  ripping through the industrial area, flattening buildings, destroying shops and creating a vast
*25:23.240- 25:28.760* :  amount of damage, and swept on down the coast, damaging housing, which has enforced many people
*25:28.760- 25:34.960* :  to be evacuated. What about the specific cause of the blast? What actually set it off? Is there
*25:34.960- 25:40.300* :  any idea about that? There are no specific details about what caused the blast, but the
*25:40.300- 25:45.160* :  president of the country, where will Rem Calawan, went on national TV this morning, and he said that
*25:45.160- 25:50.400* :  for 10 years there have been major concerns about the construction and quarrying company that was
*25:50.400- 25:56.520* :  storing these explosives at the Providence Industrial Estate, but he described the company as stubborn.
*25:57.620- 26:02.200* :  Can you just quickly finally tell us a bit about, I think there's some broader context here in
*26:02.200- 26:06.560* :  terms of flooding in seashells as well, and the emergency services, their ability to deal with
*26:06.560- 26:12.880* :  these things at the same time? It's a twin disaster for this little country today, because at the same
*26:12.880- 26:19.540* :  time as this explosion, there was exceptionally heavy rain overnight that caused flooding and of
*26:19.540- 26:26.160* :  landslide that resulted in three deaths when two homes were destroyed, and it's really pushed
*26:26.160- 26:32.520* :  the emergency services here to the limit, at a time when the country is gearing up for its
*26:32.520- 26:38.640* :  busiest tourism peak as we near Christmas, and at a time, of course, when this little country is
*26:38.640- 26:44.820* :  only just really recovering from the effects of Covid. That was Patrick Muirhead reporting. An
*26:44.820- 26:50.940* :  investigation by the BBC has revealed that a new feature of chat GPT allows paying customers to
*26:50.940- 26:56.740* :  build artificial intelligence assistance that can be used for cybercrime. Is the background for you,
*26:56.740- 27:03.500* :  launched by OpenAI last month, users are able to tailor chat GPT for almost quote anything.
*27:04.100- 27:09.960* :  So BBC News, as an experiment, created a tool that's capable of generating scam emails, texts,
*27:09.960- 27:15.520* :  and social media posts. Well, our cyber correspondent Joe Tidey was part of that experiment,
*27:15.520- 27:20.300* :  I sat down with him, and we chatted about this, and I asked him first to explain the difference
*27:20.300- 27:26.100* :  between the basic chat GPT and the premium product. There's a real high level of moderation
*27:26.200- 27:32.380* :  on the normal chat GPT that we all use, so the free version 3.5 or the paid for one, which is GPT4.
*27:32.980- 27:38.120* :  If you type in, for example, write me a scam email pretending to be from an Nigerian prince
*27:38.660- 27:42.640* :  to try and get money from somebody, the classic Nigerian prince email scams that we all
*27:42.640- 27:48.360* :  know about, it'll say no. Whereas if you build a bespoke custom GPT with the GPT builder,
*27:48.640- 27:52.820* :  the guardrail seemed to be off to a large degree, because we tested it, we built one,
*27:52.820- 27:58.460* :  called Procraft emails, we uploaded some resources for it within seconds, no coding or programming,
*27:58.460- 28:03.400* :  I can't code or program, but it was done very, very easily, and suddenly we had what experts are
*28:03.400- 28:07.880* :  saying could be classes of cybercrime tool, because when you asked it to come up with some scams,
*28:07.880- 28:12.240* :  some emails, it would do that for you, and it wouldn't say no. And kind of the only
*28:12.240- 28:16.320* :  chat GPT, their defense against this is a bit like the tobacco companies is that we just roll up
*28:16.320- 28:19.320* :  the cigarettes, we just provide the building blocks and you're the ones that are asking
*28:19.320- 28:22.800* :  it to do bad things, is that what their stance is? They haven't said anything actually,
*28:22.800- 28:27.980* :  it's been a bit bizarre here, because OpenAI has been this leader of a generative AI and obviously
*28:27.980- 28:32.520* :  Sam Altman, the CEO is traveling the world, saying how safety is so important, but it's always
*28:32.520- 28:36.600* :  about the existential risk, it's always about the idea of 10 years down the line, or how long
*28:36.600- 28:40.440* :  it's going to be, we need to be careful that these AI models don't destroy humanity.
*28:40.440- 28:44.920* :  Challenge Aussie Privacy. Exactly, yeah, whereas here's a case of actually a problematic situation
*28:44.920- 28:48.980* :  in the here and now, which OpenAI doesn't seem to want to talk about, they haven't replied
*28:48.980- 28:52.720* :  any of my emails, for example. And what's interesting is, well, when they launched the GPT builder,
*28:52.720- 28:57.840* :  they said that we are going to be very careful about moderating these tools to make sure that people
*28:57.840- 29:01.340* :  aren't building them for unethical reasons. But that obviously isn't happening, is it?
*29:01.660- 29:05.540* :  It doesn't seem to be, I'm not the only one that's done, I did this test, but then also I spoke
*29:05.540- 29:09.920* :  to a cybersecurity company and they did similar tests, and likewise, they're saying that the moderation
*29:09.940- 29:14.620* :  just isn't there, it's not with the same rigor that you would get with the overall general GPT model.
*29:15.500- 29:21.120* :  Joe Tidey. Right, let's take a break. Why don't you grab a drink? We know this is, excuse me,
*29:21.640- 29:26.340* :  a damn fine cup of coffee. I've had, I can't tell you how many cups of coffee in my life, and this
*29:26.680- 29:31.940* :  is one of the best. We're not really having a cup, but that is the coffee loving obsessive,
*29:31.940- 29:37.980* :  I would say, FBI agent Dale Cooper from the US TV series Twin Peaks. Now, you might think that the
*29:37.980- 29:42.360* :  art, the skill, the process, call it what you will, of coffee making is well established,
*29:42.360- 29:47.680* :  but it seems that scientists believe they've identified a new way of making an even better espresso.
*29:48.240- 29:54.260* :  Here's Terry Egan. It was while researchers in the US were studying how electricity of all things
*29:54.260- 29:59.440* :  affected the taste of coffee that they found something perhaps even more important,
*30:00.040- 30:06.560* :  how to enhance the flavor. Measuring the amount of static electricity that's produced when you
*30:06.560- 30:12.640* :  grind various beans, they also analysed how much difference it made where the beans came from,
*30:12.640- 30:19.260* :  and whether they were natural, washed or decaffeinated. During grinding, that electricity
*30:19.260- 30:25.800* :  causes particles to clump together and stick to the grinder. Scientists found, though,
*30:25.800- 30:32.700* :  that simply adding a splash of water to that process before the grinding greatly changed things,
*30:32.780- 30:39.540* :  producing a more consistent and tastier espresso. Their next project, now they've improved the
*30:39.540- 30:47.380* :  grind, investigating how to prepare the perfect coffee. Terry Egan. Let's go back to Israel and
*30:47.380- 30:52.420* :  Gaza to end this podcast, where the scale of the mental health crisis facing thousands of young
*30:52.420- 30:58.600* :  people caught up in the October 7 attack by Hamas is becoming clear. The Nova Music Festival was
*30:58.600- 31:04.640* :  a main target in the raids, more than 360 party goers were murdered there, another 40 were taken
*31:04.640- 31:09.980* :  hostage, but there are thousands of young survivors as well, and there's concern that the scale of
*31:09.980- 31:15.980* :  the psychological support they need is greater than the state can provide. So trained volunteers are
*31:15.980- 31:21.100* :  setting up their own centres to offer some of that help, and our correspondent Anna Foster has
*31:21.100- 31:27.800* :  visited one in Rishpon, just north of Tel Aviv. A sprawling herb garden perfumes the air with the
*31:27.800- 31:33.780* :  scent of rosemary and sage. People are lounging across a lawn scattered with colorful rugs and pillows,
*31:34.200- 31:40.060* :  and they're a fairy light strung overhead. It's a peaceful scene and a stark contrast to the darkness
*31:40.060- 31:49.060* :  that brought them here. I'm Lior Gelbaum, I'm 24 from Bethechtikwa and I survived the 7th of October
*31:49.440- 31:54.640* :  massacre. We started running towards the open field, we didn't know where we're going, we didn't
*31:54.640- 32:01.820* :  know what's happening, we just heard automatic gunshots all around us, and then we managed to
*32:02.220- 32:08.160* :  get inside Yudha and Galit's car, and they basically saved us, they got us to safety.
*32:09.040- 32:14.420* :  The spark for this place came from Dr. Leah Nail, who has a PhD in human development and
*32:14.420- 32:19.100* :  counselling. After seeing the support that families from the attacked Kibbutsim got from their
*32:19.100- 32:24.400* :  communities after the attacks, she realized that individuals from the Nova Festival didn't have
*32:24.400- 32:30.760* :  that same support network and wanted to create it for them. Their eyes were hollow, they didn't look
*32:30.800- 32:36.060* :  alive, they couldn't look at us, they would shake, they couldn't eat, they couldn't drink,
*32:36.220- 32:44.220* :  the evil that these people met is incomprehensible, and I told them early on, the darkness you saw
*32:44.220- 32:48.940* :  we're going to bring the light, we're going to help you believe in yourselves and in others again.
*32:50.380- 32:55.540* :  Dr. Nail says hundreds have now come here looking for support, everything has been driven by
*32:55.540- 33:01.680* :  volunteers and local efforts, not by the state. Sometimes it's not about talking,
*33:02.840- 33:05.880* :  there are soundbaths for reflection and contemplation,
*33:05.980- 33:17.140* :  and music has proved a huge part of the recovery process, especially because the love of it
*33:17.200- 33:22.800* :  had brought people to the festival site that day. It's been a hard time for me listening to music
*33:22.800- 33:28.640* :  since the Nova Festival and they only feel comfortable hearing music with the concerts and with
*33:28.680- 33:36.720* :  the artists that come here and I really feel that the therapists are here to help and to listen.
*33:42.880- 33:48.260* :  It is a place of peace and stillness where people wanted to be, but also you can hear the
*33:48.680- 33:55.400* :  laughter and the chatting and the fact that people are coming together and trying to be normal
*33:55.400- 34:00.920* :  in this space and the signs say what do you want to do today, what do you need today. Sometimes they
*34:00.920- 34:07.700* :  just want to walk into these beautiful herb gardens, rows and rows of green and purple and just
*34:07.700- 34:16.020* :  breathe in the air and have a place where they can feel safe. Dr. Itamar Cohen, a clinical psychologist,
*34:16.020- 34:27.220* :  came from London the week after the attack to help. People here seem tremendous amount of pain,
*34:29.900- 34:37.780* :  some of them were extremely close to not being here and I would say also that there is a sense
*34:38.660- 34:45.660* :  great sense of guilt. Why am I the one who survived and not my friend. How do you deal with all of this?
*34:45.760- 34:51.280* :  Because I know it's your job and I know it's your profession, but you're hearing a lot of
*34:51.480- 34:57.260* :  really difficult stories. Here all the therapists are working together, we have time to see
*34:57.260- 35:04.020* :  the process, to speak about the challenges, to bring ourselves in, our vulnerabilities, our fear.
*35:04.320- 35:06.080* :  So it helps you as well. I was tremendous.
*35:10.160- 35:15.320* :  The journey of recovery for survivors here will be a long one, but this place has provided a
*35:15.320- 35:20.640* :  starting point for them, a refuge and a community where they can rebuild their sense of
*35:20.640- 35:29.840* :  safety and of self. And a foster reporting. Well that is all from us for now, but there will be
*35:29.840- 35:34.840* :  a new edition of the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the
