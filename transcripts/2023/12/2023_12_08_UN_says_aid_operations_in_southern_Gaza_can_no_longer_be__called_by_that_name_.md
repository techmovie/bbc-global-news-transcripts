*03:00.640- 03:03.700* :  by many Western governments to Khan Unis.

*03:37.420- 03:39.480* :  currently focused on the largest city there,

*03:47.580- 03:49.340* :  People are running out of safe havens

*03:55.380- 03:56.640* :  gave this bleak assessment.
*03:56.820- 03:58.660* :  The message that we have been giving,
*03:58.660- 04:00.820* :  we here being the humanitarian community,
*04:01.560- 04:05.540* :  is that we do not have a humanitarian operation
*04:06.000- 04:09.980* :  in southern Gaza that can be called by that name anymore.
*04:11.260- 04:16.720* :  That the pace of the military assault in southern Gaza
*04:17.740- 04:21.120* :  is a repeat of the assault in northern Gaza.
*04:21.400- 04:24.160* :  Martin Griffiths said negotiations were underway with Israel
*04:24.380- 04:27.780* :  to open another crossing into Gaza to allow more aid in.

*04:30.440- 04:32.760* :  to keep aid flowing and to facilitate
*04:32.760- 04:35.080* :  the opening of additional field hospitals
*04:35.080- 04:37.740* :  to help cope with the huge numbers of casualties.
*04:38.520- 04:41.020* :  With fighting raging around Khan Unis and in the north,
*04:41.360- 04:43.260* :  images are circulating on social media,
*04:43.660- 04:45.300* :  showing dozens of Palestinian men,
*04:45.680- 04:47.880* :  stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground,
*04:47.880- 04:49.720* :  being guarded by Israeli soldiers.
*04:50.300- 04:53.100* :  Other pictures show them being transported in military trucks.
*04:53.140- 04:56.100* :  Israel's chief military spokesman, Daniel Hagari,
*04:56.100- 04:59.740* :  said hundreds of what he called terror suspects had been detained,
*04:59.780- 05:02.080* :  and that many had given themselves up.
*05:02.260- 05:04.580* :  But already one well-known Palestinian journalist
*05:04.580- 05:07.400* :  has been identified as among those being held.
*05:07.880- 05:09.960* :  For more on the aid situation in Gaza,
*05:10.460- 05:12.740* :  Matthew and Rolliwala spoke to Shiner Low
*05:12.740- 05:14.740* :  from the Norwegian refugee council.
*05:15.220- 05:16.980* :  What our workers are sharing with us,
*05:16.980- 05:21.460* :  our 54 staff on the ground in Gaza is simply devastating.
*05:21.660- 05:25.440* :  They are at the point now where we have had to cease our operation,
*05:25.440- 05:27.940* :  effectively cease our operations in Gaza
*05:28.260- 05:31.160* :  because our staff cannot deliver aid
*05:31.780- 05:33.940* :  when they are themselves in need of aid
*05:33.940- 05:36.920* :  and struggling to find the basic necessities,
*05:37.540- 05:40.760* :  food, clean water, a safe place to sleep,
*05:40.960- 05:42.140* :  even a place to sleep.
*05:42.200- 05:45.400* :  We have multiple staff members who are sleeping on the streets,
*05:45.400- 05:48.940* :  including a staff member with her two-month-old baby.
*05:48.940- 05:52.240* :  This is how desperate and dire the situation is.
*05:52.740- 05:55.540* :  With ongoing hostilities, mass displacement,
*05:56.220- 05:58.560* :  60% of housing damage or destroyed,
*05:58.560- 06:03.560* :  it is simply impossible to deliver a meaningful humanitarian response
*06:03.560- 06:04.900* :  under such conditions.
*06:04.900- 06:08.800* :  Since the ceasefire broke down last Friday,
*06:09.620- 06:12.920* :  how much worse is the situation got on the ground?
*06:13.180- 06:16.160* :  What we are hearing from the staff is that the situation
*06:16.300- 06:19.820* :  has just continued to deteriorate since the end of the pause.
*06:20.300- 06:22.680* :  In some ways, they feel like they were lulled
*06:22.680- 06:24.280* :  into a false sense of security
*06:24.780- 06:27.840* :  and what has happened since the collapse of the pause
*06:28.260- 06:31.160* :  has just been for ruthless or devastating
*06:31.160- 06:33.260* :  than what they saw during the seven weeks
*06:33.260- 06:34.320* :  that preceded it.
*06:34.320- 06:37.500* :  They are describing continuous bombardments,
*06:37.940- 06:41.240* :  mass panic and chaos as supplies rapidly dwindle.
*06:41.380- 06:43.840* :  They've just told us about stores that have simply shut
*06:43.960- 06:45.800* :  because they have nothing left to sell.
*06:46.120- 06:48.880* :  People are desperate, people are being pushed
*06:49.360- 06:52.620* :  from a hummus west towards the Mediterranean Sea
*06:52.620- 06:54.660* :  and south towards Rafa,
*06:55.060- 06:57.000* :  seeking any type of safe place,
*06:57.040- 06:59.560* :  but there simply is no safe place in Gaza.
*06:59.560- 07:01.780* :  The only way to guarantee the security
*07:02.420- 07:05.760* :  of the 2.3 million people trapped inside of Gaza
*07:05.760- 07:09.360* :  is to have an immediate, permanent sustained ceasefire.
*07:09.980- 07:12.400* :  Well, Israel says it's not targeting civilians,
*07:12.400- 07:16.180* :  but says Hamas hides its weapons and command centers
*07:16.760- 07:19.000* :  among a civilian population that it uses
*07:19.000- 07:20.440* :  as so-called human shields.
*07:21.080- 07:23.640* :  The Israeli government spokesperson, Elon Levy,
*07:24.040- 07:27.060* :  on Thursday accused Hamas of deliberately launching attacks
*07:27.060- 07:31.100* :  from areas in Hanunis, which Israel has designated safe zones.
*07:31.520- 07:34.540* :  Hamas is doubling down on its human shield strategy
*07:34.940- 07:37.380* :  and flagrant violation of international law
*07:37.380- 07:39.460* :  and every norm of human decency.
*07:40.020- 07:44.040* :  Israel designated the al-Mawasi area as a humanitarian zone
*07:44.120- 07:47.280* :  because Hamas has not embedded itself there
*07:47.620- 07:49.600* :  under homes and schools and hospitals,
*07:50.140- 07:52.900* :  and that is why Hamas is cynically abusing
*07:52.900- 07:55.720* :  the humanitarian zone in order to continue
*07:55.720- 07:57.880* :  attacking these people of Israel
*07:58.360- 08:00.680* :  and then try to hide behind their own people
*08:01.000- 08:02.220* :  and evade justice.
*08:02.740- 08:05.040* :  The Israeli government spokesman, Elon Levy.
*08:06.500- 08:08.920* :  The British Foreign Secretary David Cameron,
*08:08.920- 08:10.260* :  who's on a visit to Washington,
*08:10.260- 08:12.720* :  has said that President Putin and Xi
*08:13.360- 08:15.180* :  will be the only people smiling
*08:15.180- 08:18.360* :  if America fails to send more aid to Ukraine.
*08:18.460- 08:21.180* :  Republicans in the Senate on Wednesday night
*08:21.680- 08:22.480* :  refused to back a bill
*08:22.480- 08:27.380* :  containing nearly $115 billion worth of aid for Kiev.
*08:28.080- 08:29.200* :  Speaking at a press conference,
*08:29.200- 08:31.240* :  alongside the U.S. Secretary of State,
*08:31.240- 08:33.440* :  Anthony Blinken, Lord Cameron said
*08:33.440- 08:34.940* :  this was a defining moment.
*08:35.420- 08:38.240* :  I wanted to be in Washington DC this week
*08:38.740- 08:40.620* :  to make the point about how important it is
*08:40.620- 08:43.660* :  that we go on funding Ukraine and helping Ukraine
*08:43.660- 08:44.900* :  in every way we can.
*08:45.480- 08:47.520* :  I see it as the challenge of our generation.
*08:48.240- 08:50.220* :  Just as my grandfather's generation
*08:50.220- 08:53.120* :  had to fight off Nazi aggression in Europe,
*08:53.120- 08:56.580* :  we are fighting against Russian aggression in Europe.
*08:57.280- 08:59.960* :  Mr. Blinken said the United States and UK
*08:59.960- 09:04.100* :  both share the same values with regards to Ukraine.
*09:04.540- 09:05.780* :  Our countries are in lockstep
*09:06.400- 09:09.140* :  when it comes to continuing to do everything possible
*09:09.180- 09:11.260* :  to ensure that Putin's aggression
*09:11.260- 09:14.800* :  remains a strategic defeat and failure for Russia
*09:15.800- 09:19.320* :  and determined to ensure that Ukraine continues
*09:19.320- 09:20.900* :  to stand strongly on its own feet
*09:20.900- 09:22.880* :  as a sovereign independent country.
*09:23.540- 09:26.280* :  Britain has summoned the Russian ambassador
*09:26.280- 09:29.620* :  over what it called sustained but unsuccessful attempts
*09:29.980- 09:32.020* :  to interfere in British politics
*09:32.020- 09:34.000* :  through a cyber-hacking campaign.
*09:34.580- 09:36.920* :  The UK has accused Russia's security service,
*09:36.920- 09:40.280* :  the FSB, of conducting a cyber-hacking campaign
*09:40.720- 09:43.560* :  over a number of years to disrupt the democratic process.
*09:44.060- 09:47.400* :  The British government says the FSB targeted hundreds
*09:47.400- 09:49.760* :  of people, including politicians, civil servants
*09:49.760- 09:52.320* :  and journalists from at least 2015.
*09:52.880- 09:54.840* :  Russia has always denied such activity.
*09:55.300- 09:57.540* :  Our security correspondent Gordon Carrero reports.
*09:58.120- 10:01.220* :  A sustained attempt to interfere in UK politics.
*10:01.780- 10:03.800* :  That is how this campaign is being described
*10:03.800- 10:04.940* :  by British officials.
*10:05.620- 10:07.740* :  Behind it is alleged to be sent to a teen,
*10:07.740- 10:11.080* :  a unit of Russia's FSB security service.
*10:11.700- 10:13.320* :  It would impersonate personal contacts
*10:13.340- 10:15.600* :  to try to hack into the private email accounts
*10:15.640- 10:17.380* :  of people in public life.
*10:18.000- 10:19.680* :  The Foreign Office Minister Leo Dockety
*10:19.940- 10:22.220* :  told the commons that it and the House of Lords
*10:22.220- 10:23.840* :  had been in the group's sights.
*10:24.380- 10:27.180* :  They have targeted members of this house and the other place.
*10:27.300- 10:31.980* :  They have been targeting civil servants, journalists and NGOs.
*10:32.440- 10:35.080* :  They have been targeting high-profile individuals
*10:35.440- 10:37.460* :  and entities with a clear intent.
*10:38.340- 10:41.700* :  Using information, they obtain to medal in British politics.
*10:42.480- 10:45.180* :  Earlier this year, the SNP MP Stuart McDonald
*10:45.620- 10:48.420* :  told the BBC he believed his emails had been stolen.
*10:49.020- 10:52.160* :  In another case, documents about US-UK trade talks
*10:52.160- 10:55.620* :  were taken from Liam Fox, who'd been trade secretary.
*10:56.200- 10:58.980* :  These were then made public during the 2019 election.
*10:59.780- 11:02.020* :  But ministers said they believed that, overall,
*11:02.420- 11:05.160* :  the hackers had been unsuccessful at interfering
*11:05.160- 11:06.240* :  in political life.
*11:06.800- 11:08.560* :  The Russian ambassador was summoned yesterday
*11:08.560- 11:10.700* :  to the Foreign Office, although he was said
*11:10.700- 11:13.560* :  to be unavailable and officials talked to his deputy.
*11:14.300- 11:16.360* :  The UK is also sanctioned two individuals,
*11:16.360- 11:18.840* :  one of them a serving FSB officer.
*11:19.480- 11:21.540* :  The US Department of Justice sanctioned
*11:21.540- 11:22.940* :  and indicted the same pair,
*11:23.280- 11:25.640* :  accusing them of also targeting American officials.
*11:26.280- 11:28.200* :  Russia has always dismissed accusations
*11:28.860- 11:30.160* :  that it's involved in hacking
*11:30.160- 11:31.560* :  or political interference.
*11:32.260- 11:34.780* :  Gordon Carrera, the Oscar-winning British director,
*11:34.780- 11:37.760* :  Steve McQueen's formidable track record
*11:37.760- 11:42.260* :  includes acclaimed features on the 1981 IRA hunger strike
*11:42.260- 11:44.960* :  on sex addiction and on slavery.
*11:45.680- 11:48.260* :  Now he's turned to the Nazi occupation
*11:48.260- 11:50.440* :  of Amsterdam during the Second World War,
*11:50.880- 11:52.340* :  during which three-quarters
*11:52.340- 11:54.720* :  of the Dutch Jewish population were killed.
*11:55.340- 11:57.620* :  McQueen has been promoting his documentary,
*11:57.620- 12:00.160* :  which opens first in the US this month,
*12:00.440- 12:03.080* :  at a time where reports about antisemitism
*12:03.360- 12:06.160* :  have increased because of the conflict in the Middle East.
*12:06.780- 12:08.840* :  But as he's been telling the BBC's Tom Brooke,
*12:09.000- 12:11.700* :  this has merely made his film more vital and urgent.
*12:12.980- 12:18.660* :  In May 1940, Amsterdam was taken over by the Germans.
*12:22.120- 12:24.960* :  Actress Melanie Heimson rates the Steve McQueen documentary,
*12:25.020- 12:26.640* :  which is a family endeavor.
*12:27.060- 12:28.420* :  The director lives in Amsterdam
*12:28.420- 12:31.960* :  and it's a project inspired by his Dutch wife Bianca Stigter,
*12:31.960- 12:34.760* :  an historian and filmmaker who wrote a book,
*12:35.080- 12:36.700* :  Atlas of an Occupied City.
*12:37.140- 12:38.500* :  A door-to-door compendium,
*12:38.500- 12:40.780* :  detailing the fate of Amsterdam Jews and others
*12:40.980- 12:42.320* :  during the Nazi occupation.
*12:43.300- 12:45.960* :  Soon the Nazis started to ban Jews from parks,
*12:45.980- 12:48.900* :  pools, shops, cafes and schools
*12:49.360- 12:50.360* :  from all public life.
*12:52.180- 12:54.740* :  Music by Jewish composers could no longer be played.
*12:57.560- 13:00.080* :  Steve McQueen's film just poses images of
*13:00.080- 13:03.180* :  Covid era Amsterdam with chilling stories of the Nazis
*13:03.840- 13:05.880* :  systematic efforts to extinguish Jewish life
*13:06.140- 13:06.920* :  from its neighborhoods.
*13:07.540- 13:09.440* :  The director hopes his film brings out
*13:09.440- 13:12.440* :  from the shadows a very dark chapter in the history
*13:12.440- 13:13.800* :  of his adopted city.
*13:14.620- 13:16.620* :  What really shocked me in some ways when I first started
*13:16.620- 13:18.700* :  to live in Amsterdam is that I thought I was living with ghosts,
*13:19.240- 13:21.820* :  that there was another narrative going on other than my own.
*13:22.300- 13:25.480* :  And somehow to trace that through the present day was sort of
*13:25.480- 13:26.280* :  for me vital.
*13:26.460- 13:29.220* :  I needed the evidence of things not seen.
*13:29.220- 13:32.440* :  With my film, one trying to say that it doesn't make sense.
*13:32.660- 13:34.580* :  I mean, how do you make sense of six million people
*13:34.720- 13:35.440* :  being executed?
*13:36.260- 13:37.960* :  Out we came of these wagons.
*13:38.640- 13:39.960* :  We had to line up.
*13:41.260- 13:43.060* :  And I asked, where are we?
*13:43.420- 13:44.960* :  And they told me our Schwitz.
*13:45.980- 13:47.560* :  Other documentaries on the Holocaust,
*13:47.560- 13:50.460* :  like the landmark 1985 French film Shoah,
*13:50.680- 13:53.000* :  used testimony from Holocaust survivors themselves.
*13:53.000- 13:55.940* :  But that population is fast disappearing.
*13:57.760- 14:00.060* :  So as Steve McQueen's wife Bianca explains,
*14:00.060- 14:03.560* :  occupies city tries to tell a story in a different way.
*14:03.940- 14:06.840* :  There's no talking heads, there's no archive footage.
*14:06.840- 14:11.680* :  What you see is contemporary images of Amsterdam on the street.
*14:12.440- 14:18.280* :  You are seeing what happened there during the German occupation of Amsterdam.
*14:20.400- 14:22.920* :  In a tumultuous time with the ongoing war in Ukraine
*14:22.920- 14:24.480* :  and the conflict in the Middle East,
*14:24.480- 14:26.960* :  Steve McQueen hopes his film makes audiences aware
*14:26.980- 14:29.020* :  of pending political dangers.
*14:30.020- 14:32.100* :  It's a cause of tolerance in somebody's sort of
*14:32.760- 14:34.840* :  being active in our everyday to make it, you know,
*14:35.140- 14:36.200* :  just change things, you know.
*14:36.420- 14:40.320* :  We have to be proactive, particularly in these times, you know.
*14:40.340- 14:41.140* :  It's all about love.
*14:41.900- 14:43.720* :  So anything worth dying for or living for.
*14:44.280- 14:47.740* :  The film is arriving in cinemas at a time
*14:47.740- 14:52.260* :  when the Middle East conflict has become very inflamed once again
*14:52.840- 14:55.820* :  and antisemitism by different accounts is rising.
*14:55.920- 14:58.880* :  Do you think that's going to change the way in which people view the film?
*14:59.220- 14:59.480* :  Yes.
*14:59.520- 15:04.240* :  In fact, it may be made the film more vital, more urgent.
*15:05.020- 15:07.820* :  This is a film about resilience and triumph.
*15:08.180- 15:08.620* :  And that's all.
*15:08.760- 15:10.640* :  You know, Jews, non-Jews, whatever.
*15:10.640- 15:12.660* :  It has a sense of human beings who are resilient.
*15:13.500- 15:14.500* :  And, you know, come through it all.
*15:17.180- 15:19.920* :  Steve McQueen's film opens in the US on Christmas Day.
*15:19.920- 15:22.460* :  It arrives in the UK in a month later in the new year.
*15:22.900- 15:26.960* :  It's hardly festive fare, but it's been lauded as a monumental film.
*15:26.980- 15:31.400* :  Although there have been detractors, the four hour and 22 minutes running time
*15:31.400- 15:32.520* :  does intimidate.
*15:32.880- 15:36.760* :  But to its admirers, it's an original and artful excavation
*15:36.760- 15:40.860* :  of the terrifying darkness that gripped Amsterdam more than 80 years ago.
*15:42.280- 15:44.840* :  In 1941, they started rounding people up.
*15:47.440- 15:50.100* :  In 1942, the deportations began.
*15:53.560- 15:54.960* :  That report was by Tombrook.
*15:57.540- 15:58.180* :  Still to come.
*15:58.560- 15:59.720* :  Lego needs no introduction.
*15:59.720- 16:04.180* :  But for those unfamiliar with Fortnite, it's one of the biggest online games in the world,
*16:04.500- 16:06.860* :  attracting more than 70 million players a month.
*16:07.500- 16:12.040* :  And now participants of one of the world's biggest video games
*16:12.440- 16:15.900* :  will now be able to build their own virtual objects with Lego bricks.
*16:17.000- 16:19.700* :  Hey, it's Ryan Reynolds, owner and user of Mint Mobile.
*16:19.700- 16:21.800* :  And I am recording this message on my phone and literally on my mint phone.
*16:23.340- 16:23.480* :  Why?
*16:23.980- 16:25.080* :  Because fancy recording studios cost money.

*17:58.620- 17:58.920* :  Welcome back.
*17:58.920- 18:02.960* :  The United States has said it stands by its unwavering support
*18:02.960- 18:04.560* :  for Guyana's sovereignty.
*18:05.080- 18:09.720* :  That's after Venezuela announced plans to annex the oil rich S.A.K.B.O. region.
*18:10.280- 18:15.420* :  Earlier, the U.S. said it would carry out joint Air Force maneuvers with Guyana.
*18:15.420- 18:20.320* :  At a news conference, the spokesman for the White House National Security Council, John Kirby,
*18:20.840- 18:25.320* :  said the U.S. wanted to see a peaceful resolution to the dispute between the two countries.
*18:25.960- 18:30.280* :  We obviously support the peaceful resolution of the border dispute between Venezuela and Guyana.
*18:30.760- 18:35.080* :  And we absolutely stand by our unwavering support for Guyana's sovereignty.
*18:35.740- 18:41.740* :  The 1899 arbitral award that determined the land boundary between those two countries should be respected.
*18:42.280- 18:45.600* :  And lesser until the parties themselves reach a new agreement
*18:45.940- 18:48.960* :  or a competent legal body decides otherwise and that hadn't happened.
*18:49.580- 18:53.940* :  So we're going to urge Venezuela and Guyana to continue to seek a peaceful resolution of this dispute
*18:54.240- 18:56.020* :  including by the International Court of Justice.
*18:56.240- 19:01.160* :  The referendum in Venezuela supported the country's long-standing claim to S.A.K.B.O.
*19:01.620- 19:04.900* :  Caracas has even given concessions to some of its oil companies there.
*19:05.280- 19:09.480* :  Now Brazil says it's sending more soldiers to its northern border with Venezuela.
*19:10.260- 19:13.280* :  I heard more about the dispute between Guyana and Venezuela
*19:13.280- 19:16.160* :  from the BBC's South America correspondent Katie Watson.
*19:16.500- 19:20.700* :  Firstly about the comments from the U.S. Embassy in the Guyana's capital, Georgetown.
*19:21.540- 19:28.100* :  So the Embassy in the capital, Georgetown, has said that it's remaining a trusted security partner
*19:28.100- 19:33.980* :  and it's continuing to work with Guyana's armed forces over many areas.
*19:33.980- 19:43.540* :  So this is a clear sign of the concerns in the region as a result of the referendum on Sunday.
*19:43.940- 19:48.360* :  And Brazil's worried as well because it shares a border both with Venezuela and Guyana, doesn't it?
*19:48.580- 19:55.500* :  Yeah, so I mean here in Brazil the President Lula de Silva has been an ally in the past with Maduro
*19:55.500- 20:02.040* :  but there is growing concern about the belligerent approach that the government in Venezuela was taking.
*20:02.040- 20:08.780* :  They've said that they've bolstered the number of troops on the border in Horaima State with Venezuela.
*20:08.980- 20:13.940* :  They're also bringing in more armed armed vehicles as a result.
*20:13.980- 20:21.380* :  They've talked to the Maduro administration voicing their concerns over the increasing tension there.
*20:21.720- 20:28.040* :  Do you think there's any real danger that there might be some kind of military confrontation between Venezuela and Guyana over this?
*20:28.240- 20:33.320* :  It's hard because I mean I think when people saw what was happening with the referendum in Venezuela,
*20:33.320- 20:40.240* :  some people were thinking really is this just a posturing before trying to get popularity ahead of a 2024 election
*20:40.320- 20:46.780* :  or indeed trying to put off the election because giving the excuse of war or something like that,
*20:46.780- 20:49.820* :  they were trying to understand what was behind the moves.
*20:49.820- 20:55.240* :  But I mean the fact that they're bolstering troops, I mean there's a lot to lose with Venezuela,
*20:55.280- 20:57.580* :  especially the fact that they've just had their sanctions.
*20:57.580- 21:06.900* :  You have sanctions, some lifted on the oil industry and those threat that's a threat to whip them back on again if there is aggression.
*21:06.940- 21:11.400* :  But yeah, it's a real concern. What exactly where Venezuela really wants to go with this?
*21:12.120- 21:12.720* :  Katie Watson.
*21:13.340- 21:18.560* :  The British Home Secretary, James Cleveley, has criticised a move by the tech-gyed meta
*21:18.560- 21:24.380* :  to roll out end-to-end encryption for all personal chats and calls on Facebook and Messenger.
*21:24.800- 21:29.760* :  It means meta will no longer have access to the contents of what users send or receive
*21:30.240- 21:33.720* :  unless someone involved in the chat reports a message to the company.
*21:34.280- 21:36.300* :  Our technology editor Zoe Kleinman reports.
*21:37.080- 21:39.940* :  Meta has been promising to encrypt Messenger for a while now.
*21:39.940- 21:44.940* :  It's already available for those who choose to opt in but will now be the default option.
*21:45.740- 21:49.760* :  Supporters of encryption argue that it protects everybody's privacy and security
*21:49.760- 21:55.620* :  and is for some such as activists operating under harsh regimes, a crucial tool for survival.
*21:56.360- 22:01.460* :  End-to-end encryption cannot be broken by either the firm which operates it or by law enforcement.
*22:02.160- 22:06.620* :  The Child Protection Charity of the Internet Watch Foundation described Meta's move as catastrophic,
*22:06.620- 22:11.860* :  saying it will make it more difficult to catch those using Messenger to groom and harm children.
*22:12.580- 22:16.960* :  Meta said it had a variety of other tools which would enable it to proactively detect accounts
*22:16.960- 22:20.440* :  engaged in malicious behaviour without scanning messages.
*22:21.380- 22:22.060* :  Zoe Kleinman.
*22:22.600- 22:27.920* :  The makers of one of the world's biggest video games, Fort Knight, have released a high profile collaboration
*22:27.920- 22:31.020* :  with the Danish construction toy company Lego.
*22:31.760- 22:35.900* :  Epic Games, whose revenues topped $5.6 billion last year,
*22:36.280- 22:39.420* :  said they want to reach new audiences from children to adults.
*22:40.100- 22:44.920* :  Once the games go live, players will be able to build their own virtual objects with Lego bricks.
*22:44.920- 22:48.200* :  Our technology correspondent Mark Gislik has more.
*22:48.540- 22:51.620* :  Lego needs no introduction, but for those unfamiliar with Fort Knight,
*22:51.620- 22:56.780* :  it's one of the biggest online games in the world, attracting more than 70 million players a month.
*22:56.800- 23:00.360* :  It's perhaps most famous for its so-called battle royale mode.
*23:03.080- 23:07.960* :  Up to 100 players have the chance to build virtual defenses before they fight it out amongst each other,
*23:08.300- 23:09.600* :  the last one standing wins.
*23:10.360- 23:13.960* :  The title is free to play but makes money by selling virtual items within the game,
*23:13.960- 23:15.900* :  such as new outfits or weapons.
*23:16.600- 23:22.440* :  Lego Fort Knight is an entirely new game which focuses more on building an exploration rather than combat.
*23:22.940- 23:26.760* :  The new survival mode, as it's called, bears a marked resemblance to Minecraft,
*23:26.760- 23:29.020* :  the world's biggest online game.
*23:29.020- 23:32.020* :  The original Fort Knight is no stranger to controversy,
*23:32.020- 23:36.800* :  with questions being raised about child safety in the game since it launched in 2017.
*23:37.540- 23:41.680* :  Adam Susman, the boss of Epic Games, says that's been taken into consideration
*23:41.680- 23:43.320* :  when designing the new version.
*23:43.640- 23:44.400* :  We've been on a journey.
*23:44.400- 23:47.920* :  You don't implement these features in a week or a day,
*23:48.060- 23:50.620* :  like these are things that we've been building for years and years.
*23:50.840- 23:55.400* :  And so one of the things that we recently implemented was a rating system.
*23:55.840- 23:59.820* :  So each piece of content is rated appropriately for the audience,
*23:59.820- 24:07.380* :  and we allow through our parental controls the parents decide what type of content their kids will be able to see.
*24:07.500- 24:11.440* :  The collaboration with Lego is a clear move to attract younger players to the Fort Knight ecosystem.
*24:11.440- 24:15.340* :  But given the criticism from some parents groups and even Prince Harry,
*24:15.740- 24:19.720* :  there are those in the industry who think this represents a bit of a gamble for Epic Games.
*24:20.200- 24:22.880* :  The new mode, featuring the world's most famous plastic bricks,
*24:23.220- 24:24.460* :  will be added to Fort Knight today,
*24:24.980- 24:28.960* :  while they manage to build an even bigger audience for this gaming behemoth.
*24:29.460- 24:31.300* :  Our technology correspondent, Marc Chiesler.
*24:31.980- 24:33.540* :  Here's a quick quiz question.
*24:34.160- 24:41.420* :  What has Filipino hand loom weaving got in common with multi-village fates and Cuban rumble music?
*24:41.880- 24:46.780* :  The answer is that all of them have been adopted as intangible cultural heritage
*24:47.440- 24:50.100* :  by the United Nations Culture Agency, UNESCO.
*24:50.780- 24:55.400* :  There are nearly 700 cultural practices on that list, and now there's a new one.
*25:03.140- 25:07.920* :  Yes, UNESCO has just announced that Italian opera is being added.
*25:07.980- 25:12.040* :  I spoke about this to our Europe Regional Editor, Paul Moss.
*25:12.820- 25:15.980* :  This stems from a convention, which was signed in 2003,
*25:16.760- 25:19.840* :  to protect what is called intangible cultural heritage.
*25:20.020- 25:21.340* :  Now, the idea is actually quite simple.
*25:21.340- 25:25.940* :  If you want to preserve the physical objects of a culture like this from a handicraft
*25:26.080- 25:27.560* :  or some other artwork, it's easier.
*25:28.040- 25:29.160* :  You put it in a museum.
*25:29.820- 25:33.080* :  But not so easy with a traditional form of dance, for example,
*25:33.080- 25:35.280* :  or here's another thing that's already on the list.
*25:35.280- 25:39.160* :  Traditional Kiergistani midwifery, that is on the list.
*25:39.700- 25:44.580* :  145 countries signed up to this convention and basically agreed that if a traditional practice
*25:44.580- 25:48.760* :  from their country is on the list, they will do everything they can to preserve
*25:48.760- 25:50.440* :  and indeed promote it.
*25:50.500- 25:53.800* :  UNESCO say that's particularly important nowadays with globalization,
*25:54.120- 25:58.660* :  the danger that culture becomes uniform, they want to preserve diversity,
*25:58.660- 25:59.880* :  and this is the way they do it.
*25:59.980- 26:03.380* :  Paul, no disrespect meant to Kiergistani midwifes,
*26:03.420- 26:08.820* :  but why is Italian opera only now getting this recognition?
*26:09.080- 26:10.800* :  Well, I can tell you what UNESCO says.
*26:10.800- 26:16.920* :  They say it's a physiologically controlled way of singing that enhances the carrying power of the voice
*26:17.480- 26:20.220* :  and is associated with specific facial expressions.
*26:20.220- 26:25.960* :  The knowledge and skills are transmitted orally between a maestro and a pupil.
*26:25.960- 26:27.600* :  Now, of course, you could say other countries,
*26:27.600- 26:29.500* :  often traditions also have these qualities.
*26:29.500- 26:31.860* :  The point is, though, that beyond the UNESCO list,
*26:31.860- 26:33.820* :  it means you are the origin of this practice.
*26:33.820- 26:38.480* :  I am reliably informed opera began in Florence in the 16th century.
*26:38.900- 26:42.280* :  Interestingly, it was originally about setting Greek myths to music.
*26:42.800- 26:44.700* :  So the origin is not exclusively Italian,
*26:44.700- 26:47.900* :  but it's Italy that really took this tradition on.
*26:48.160- 26:51.620* :  I should say Italy does already have entries on the UNESCO list,
*26:51.620- 26:55.380* :  but these include the Italian way of mountain climbing.
*26:55.380- 26:57.480* :  And also, I kid you not.
*26:57.480- 27:02.860* :  Also on the list is the specific neapolitan way of preparing the dough for pizza.
*27:03.480- 27:05.680* :  So Italian opera is in good company.
*27:06.260- 27:08.320* :  I Europe Regional Editor, Paul Moss.
*27:11.120- 27:11.960* :  And that's all from us for now,
*27:11.960- 27:14.960* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later on.
