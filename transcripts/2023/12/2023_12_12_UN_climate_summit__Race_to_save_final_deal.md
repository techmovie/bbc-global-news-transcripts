*01:33.700- 01:35.180* :  these are our main stories.
*01:35.180- 01:39.740* :  The presidency of the COP28 summit says a new draft statement will be released
*01:40.180- 01:43.100* :  amid anger over a previous version that failed to mention
*01:43.100- 01:45.160* :  phasing out of fossil fuels.
*01:45.800- 01:47.920* :  Nithiopia, a government minister, is arrested
*01:48.240- 01:51.560* :  after being sacked for comments criticizing the authority's decision
*01:51.900- 01:53.600* :  to ban an anti-war rally.
*01:54.160- 01:58.340* :  We find out why Myanmar is now the world's leading producer of opium.
*02:01.080- 02:05.020* :  Also in this podcast, in Israel, the father of a young woman killed in October
*02:05.020- 02:08.480* :  the 7th says, if Hamas is rooted out in Gaza,
*02:08.980- 02:12.360* :  he believes that peaceful coexistence can happen.
*02:12.860- 02:14.400* :  I hope that like in two to four years,
*02:14.400- 02:16.320* :  we'll be able to do peace and build two states
*02:16.740- 02:18.440* :  and be able to live together next to each other.
*02:18.800- 02:22.820* :  But everyone that's responsible for what happened in October 7th will be eliminated.
*02:28.040- 02:32.520* :  Leaders of the COP28 climate talks in Dubai have gone back to the drawing board,
*02:32.860- 02:36.580* :  trying to come up with a suitable joint statement on the future of the planet.
*02:36.900- 02:41.460* :  A draft released on Monday was criticised for failing to include any mention
*02:41.480- 02:43.280* :  of phasing out of fossil fuels,
*02:43.620- 02:45.120* :  already a contentious issue,
*02:45.360- 02:49.880* :  because this year's summit is being hosted by the oil-rich United Arab Emirates.
*02:50.700- 02:53.260* :  Lipria Kangajum, a 12-year-old from India,
*02:53.600- 02:55.620* :  stormed the state at the summit on Monday
*02:55.620- 02:58.400* :  with a sign calling for an end to fossil fuels.
*02:58.920- 03:01.560* :  The climate activists had her security clearance taken away
*03:01.920- 03:04.860* :  and said she and other youngsters had been let down.
*03:05.420- 03:10.840* :  A total number of 2,456 fossil fuel lobbies
*03:11.220- 03:13.040* :  were granted access to it.
*03:13.320- 03:14.500* :  How is this fair?
*03:14.740- 03:16.700* :  It's a sudden increase, you know,
*03:17.040- 03:20.180* :  and allowing fossil fuel lobbies into the space,
*03:20.680- 03:24.240* :  copying it has become into a fossil fuel summit now.
*03:24.500- 03:29.060* :  And fossil fuels are killing us and every keep burning them.
*03:29.560- 03:33.220* :  We are destroying our own Mother Nature, our own planet.
*03:34.340- 03:37.260* :  Well, this morning, the Emirati Director General of the Conference,
*03:37.260- 03:40.660* :  Magi Al-Suadi, said everything was going to plan.
*03:41.440- 03:43.520* :  As you know, yesterday we released a text.
*03:44.100- 03:49.320* :  As you also know, lots of parties felt it didn't fully address their concerns.
*03:50.260- 03:51.300* :  We expected that.
*03:52.100- 03:55.660* :  In fact, we wanted the text to spark conversations,
*03:56.440- 03:57.300* :  and that's what's happened.
*03:58.340- 04:02.720* :  We spent last night talking, taking in that feedback,
*04:03.760- 04:07.020* :  and that has put us in a position to draft a new text.
*04:07.420- 04:11.020* :  Critics say significant changes to the draft text will be needed
*04:11.400- 04:15.540* :  to achieve the unanimous approval of nearly 200 countries in attendance.
*04:16.220- 04:19.940* :  Cassie Flynn is Head of Climate Change at the UN Development Program.
*04:20.700- 04:22.100* :  There are a few missing points.
*04:22.140- 04:27.740* :  One is there has to land an agreement on the future of fossil fuels.
*04:28.500- 04:32.180* :  Right now, the language is criticized as too watery.
*04:32.180- 04:36.900* :  It's not clear enough to give that signal about what is the future of fossil fuels in the world.
*04:37.680- 04:39.020* :  The next is on adaptation.
*04:39.860- 04:41.600* :  Climate crisis is on our doorstep.
*04:42.040- 04:43.520* :  Countries need the right financing.
*04:43.520- 04:47.240* :  They need the right support to be able to be resilient to all of these impacts.
*04:47.240- 04:49.800* :  That's not as much in the text.
*04:50.280- 04:51.840* :  For more on the stalemate at COP,
*04:51.840- 04:55.640* :  I spoke to our Environment correspondent Matt McGraw, who's in Dubai.
*04:56.300- 05:01.040* :  You've heard there from the Emirati's talking about the text that they put out yesterday,
*05:01.040- 05:04.360* :  as a way of kind of flushing out other countries' red lines.
*05:04.360- 05:07.240* :  Essentially, they're most important bargaining positions.
*05:08.020- 05:10.940* :  And a lot of people here are taking that with a pinch of salt,
*05:10.940- 05:12.780* :  saying they could have done that two weeks ago,
*05:12.780- 05:17.620* :  and they had had two weeks to improve the offer on the table at that stage.
*05:18.340- 05:20.080* :  But it's in the process at the moment.
*05:20.080- 05:22.220* :  They have taken new soundings from the parties,
*05:22.640- 05:24.240* :  a number of delegates from the European Union,
*05:24.240- 05:25.520* :  United States and other countries.
*05:25.520- 05:28.300* :  We're meeting late into the night working on new texts.
*05:28.740- 05:31.480* :  They have been fed up to the presidency,
*05:32.020- 05:37.340* :  and we're expecting a new draft agreement sometime later this afternoon,
*05:37.340- 05:40.740* :  which should reflect those positions more clearly.
*05:41.340- 05:46.780* :  So, who is opposed to putting phasing out fossil fuels actually in the statement?
*05:47.840- 05:50.260* :  There's a number of different groupings who are opposed to it.
*05:50.260- 05:52.480* :  The first and most obvious ones are the petrostates,
*05:52.480- 05:55.320* :  such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and others.
*05:55.800- 05:57.460* :  There are other countries like Bolivia who say,
*05:57.780- 05:59.480* :  this is not something they want to do.
*05:59.480- 06:00.780* :  They're very opposed to it as well.
*06:01.120- 06:03.600* :  A number of African countries are having mixed views on it,
*06:03.600- 06:07.980* :  because they think the issues are more about finance and more about helping them to adapt
*06:07.980- 06:10.980* :  than they are about stopping the emissions from fossil fuels,
*06:11.360- 06:14.320* :  and many of those countries want to continue to develop their own fossil fuels
*06:14.540- 06:15.340* :  in many parts of Africa.
*06:15.340- 06:18.680* :  So, there's a broad number of countries who are opposed to it,
*06:18.980- 06:21.440* :  but there's a great number of about 120 countries
*06:21.780- 06:24.220* :  who say now is the time to draw a line under fossil fuels.
*06:24.520- 06:25.700* :  The science says it must happen,
*06:26.100- 06:30.200* :  and they are backing that to happen right here in Dubai.
*06:31.120- 06:33.520* :  Matt, you've attended many of these summits.
*06:33.520- 06:34.860* :  I've talked to you many times.
*06:35.900- 06:37.880* :  What is your impression of this one?
*06:38.420- 06:41.520* :  Is real progress being made, do you think, or are stalling?
*06:42.660- 06:44.520* :  It's very hard to tell at this point, Valerie.
*06:44.520- 06:45.800* :  Yes, I have been to a lot of these.
*06:45.900- 06:48.740* :  I think the biggest thing from, I can see in the last 24 hours
*06:48.740- 06:51.400* :  as a sense of shock, people believe they were going to get something,
*06:51.400- 06:53.380* :  and then the rug was pulled from under them.
*06:53.700- 06:57.420* :  Now we're back in a very much a sense of broken or battered trust,
*06:57.960- 06:59.820* :  and if they can build something together
*07:00.120- 07:01.500* :  from what's happened yesterday,
*07:01.840- 07:03.560* :  I think it'll be quite the achievement.
*07:04.400- 07:06.760* :  Matt McGraw, speaking to me, from Dubai.
*07:08.020- 07:10.240* :  There's fresh political turmoil in Ethiopia
*07:10.240- 07:13.360* :  after the sacking of the country's state minister for peace.
*07:13.900- 07:16.360* :  turmoil and a scathing government statement
*07:16.360- 07:19.420* :  that accuses the minister of working with what it called
*07:19.420- 07:23.600* :  anti-peace elements and of being involved in terrorism and kidnapping.
*07:24.200- 07:27.660* :  So, what is the minister down to end the wrath of the government?
*07:28.140- 07:31.560* :  I asked our correspondent in Addis Ababa, Calcutan Ibeltel.
*07:32.220- 07:34.460* :  Well, the minister, Mr. Tayyed and Ah,
*07:34.700- 07:38.460* :  has been very vocal in recent weeks, giving different remarks,
*07:38.460- 07:42.380* :  particularly criticizing the government regarding
*07:42.380- 07:44.420* :  ongoing conflicts in Ethiopia.
*07:44.420- 07:47.640* :  A few weeks ago, he blamed the government
*07:47.640- 07:50.700* :  for failed peace talks with a rebel group.
*07:51.200- 07:53.020* :  These talks were held in Tanzania,
*07:53.720- 07:56.240* :  with the help of the US and the Norwegian governments.
*07:56.880- 08:00.240* :  And there were hopes that they could bring some peace
*08:00.920- 08:03.300* :  for Ethiopia's largest region, Oromia.
*08:03.640- 08:07.040* :  But the these peace talks didn't succeed and they failed.
*08:07.040- 08:11.240* :  And now we are hearing a renewed conflict in that region.
*08:11.240- 08:15.060* :  And he was pretty fiery in his remarks,
*08:15.060- 08:17.900* :  accusing the government and blaming it for the failure.
*08:18.640- 08:21.420* :  And in recent days, he was also in the news
*08:21.420- 08:24.620* :  when he gave strong statements criticizing, again,
*08:24.620- 08:27.940* :  the authorities for banning an anti-war rally,
*08:27.940- 08:31.000* :  which was scheduled to be held last Sunday.
*08:31.440- 08:32.600* :  It was banned by the authorities.
*08:32.600- 08:36.020* :  And they ended up arresting around 97 people
*08:36.020- 08:38.940* :  who they said were connected with this rally,
*08:38.940- 08:40.660* :  which was illegal in their eyes.
*08:41.020- 08:42.980* :  So, after these remarks, he was in the news.
*08:42.980- 08:45.840* :  And yesterday came the news of his sacking.
*08:45.840- 08:48.380* :  He posted on his social media platforms,
*08:48.380- 08:51.880* :  particularly on Facebook, saying that he has been sacked
*08:51.880- 08:54.920* :  and he posted the dismissal later that he received.
*08:55.440- 08:58.440* :  And at that time, he also hit back at the government
*08:58.440- 09:00.260* :  and that the Prime Minister, particularly,
*09:00.680- 09:04.140* :  criticizing him for failing to bring peace to the country.
*09:04.620- 09:06.140* :  And was he fired and then arrested?
*09:06.960- 09:10.020* :  Yes, the news of the arrest came this afternoon.
*09:10.020- 09:12.380* :  He was fired yesterday and then this afternoon,
*09:12.780- 09:14.500* :  the news of his arrest came from the authorities.
*09:14.500- 09:18.500* :  They accused him of being involved with the terrorist acts,
*09:18.500- 09:21.000* :  including kidnapped pings of individuals,
*09:21.000- 09:23.800* :  as well as having links with some of the armed groups
*09:24.380- 09:25.800* :  between his sacking yesterday.
*09:25.800- 09:27.480* :  And he's arrested.
*09:27.480- 09:30.540* :  He has been giving various remarks to different media outlets,
*09:30.540- 09:31.520* :  including to the BBC.
*09:31.520- 09:35.480* :  And he was very strongly criticizing the government.
*09:36.300- 09:37.580* :  Cal Qadan Ibn Tal.
*09:38.600- 09:42.000* :  The Pakistani army says at least 23 soldiers have been killed
*09:42.320- 09:44.520* :  in a militant attack on a security compound
*09:44.520- 09:46.100* :  in the northwest of the country.
*09:46.240- 09:49.840* :  It's had the insurgents rammed and explosives laden vehicle
*09:49.840- 09:52.620* :  into the premises, causing a building to collapse.
*09:53.220- 09:54.700* :  Here's Anbarathan Efe Rajan.
*09:55.380- 09:58.000* :  The attack on the Pakistani security compound
*09:58.000- 10:02.160* :  began early morning with militants launching a coordinated assault
*10:02.160- 10:05.960* :  in Dera Ismail Khan district near the border with Afghanistan.
*10:06.640- 10:08.920* :  The explosions caused a building to collapse,
*10:08.920- 10:10.960* :  resulting in multiple casualties.
*10:11.560- 10:14.640* :  Some of those injured are said to be in a critical condition.
*10:15.160- 10:17.980* :  A group affiliated to the Pakistani Taliban said
*10:17.980- 10:19.960* :  its fighters carried out the assault.
*10:20.560- 10:22.900* :  The military said six insurgents were killed.
*10:23.340- 10:26.880* :  Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks
*10:26.880- 10:29.520* :  mainly along its border with Afghanistan.
*10:29.520- 10:34.260* :  After the Pakistani Taliban group withdrew from a ceasefire last year.
*10:34.420- 10:35.980* :  Anbarathan Efe Rajan.
*10:36.380- 10:38.260* :  Football now and referees used to be
*10:38.260- 10:40.120* :  meant to be sacrosanct.
*10:40.440- 10:41.840* :  You could disagree with their decisions,
*10:41.840- 10:44.000* :  cheer them, accuse them of being blind,
*10:44.520- 10:46.160* :  say some unrepeatable things,
*10:46.160- 10:49.380* :  and it was all up to a point, good, clean fun.
*10:49.860- 10:51.200* :  But they were untouchable.
*10:51.700- 10:52.120* :  No longer.
*10:52.400- 10:54.820* :  Here's a quick flavor of what happened at the end of a match
*10:55.220- 10:56.420* :  in Turkey's top league.
*11:00.160- 11:02.880* :  Well, the images are shocking as the crowd roars.
*11:02.880- 11:04.960* :  The match referee is punched to the ground
*11:04.960- 11:06.800* :  by a man who it transpires
*11:07.100- 11:09.080* :  is president of one of the clubs involved.
*11:09.460- 11:12.000* :  The referee is then kicked in the head at least once
*11:12.420- 11:13.520* :  as he lies on the ground.
*11:13.580- 11:16.600* :  The scenes have stunned football mad Turkey.
*11:17.060- 11:19.020* :  The Turkish football federation has suspended
*11:19.020- 11:21.280* :  all professional matches indefinitely
*11:21.660- 11:23.860* :  and even President Erdogan has weighed in,
*11:24.200- 11:27.160* :  saying that sports should be about peace and brotherhood.
*11:27.460- 11:30.780* :  I got the latest from our colleague Emre Temel of BBC Turkish.

*12:05.300- 12:06.520* :  with the help of the police.

*17:17.980- 17:18.920* :  She loved to dance.
*17:18.920- 17:20.300* :  She loved animals.
*17:20.960- 17:23.620* :  She loved to wake surf, to snowboard,

*17:32.720- 17:33.980* :  She was an amazing, amazing girl.
*17:34.580- 17:37.700* :  I understand that you went to the location
*17:37.700- 17:39.320* :  and you found the car.
*17:39.640- 17:39.800* :  Yeah.
*17:40.200- 17:44.780* :  We took three officers in the Jeep and went down south
*17:45.320- 17:50.020* :  and then we found the car and it was full of bullet holes.
*17:50.800- 17:52.820* :  And there's a lot of blood inside the car.
*17:53.320- 17:55.100* :  And I was hoping that either she was wounded
*17:55.100- 17:56.760* :  and she was able to escape or
*17:57.120- 17:58.860* :  wounded and taken a hostage.
*17:58.860- 18:01.740* :  But two and a half days after that,
*18:01.740- 18:03.980* :  they told the state to identify the body.
*18:04.260- 18:07.840* :  What would you like people to understand about her?
*18:08.220- 18:10.080* :  People who never had a chance to meet her?
*18:11.180- 18:12.680* :  She never did anything wrong to anyone.
*18:13.520- 18:14.860* :  She just loved doing good things.
*18:16.300- 18:18.040* :  And then they just murdered her for no reason.
*18:18.880- 18:22.260* :  She went to celebrate, you know, love, music, freedom, dance,
*18:23.640- 18:24.480* :  and then everything back.
*18:25.680- 18:27.760* :  In the past, you were involved.
*18:27.800- 18:30.820* :  And I think you were one of the first in employing Palestinians
*18:30.820- 18:32.800* :  that you made this investment in Gaza.
*18:32.880- 18:36.060* :  And I know you also, you have employed people in the West Bank.
*18:36.900- 18:37.960* :  Do you regret that now?
*18:38.200- 18:40.020* :  No. I don't regret it.
*18:40.520- 18:42.000* :  I built a design center in Gaza.
*18:42.620- 18:45.740* :  I donated 360,000 dollars to a hospital in Gaza.
*18:46.300- 18:48.800* :  I started a peace initiative with Gaza.
*18:49.240- 18:52.540* :  I think I need to do and we need to do everything we can
*18:52.540- 18:56.100* :  to make this place the best place to live in.
*18:56.100- 18:57.820* :  And we need to stop getting each other
*18:57.820- 18:59.280* :  and finding a way to live together.
*19:00.080- 19:02.860* :  But before that, anyone that was responsible,
*19:03.720- 19:06.220* :  anyone that was associated with what happened
*19:06.900- 19:09.000* :  in October 7th, 23 will be eliminated.
*19:09.760- 19:11.940* :  Do you think that her mask can be eliminated?
*19:11.940- 19:13.140* :  You've been in the military.
*19:13.140- 19:15.800* :  You know how difficult it is to fight.
*19:16.320- 19:17.720* :  Can you eliminate an idea?
*19:18.400- 19:19.680* :  It's not an idea. It's people.
*19:20.340- 19:22.120* :  We know exactly who came, who raped,
*19:22.720- 19:24.160* :  who butchered,
*19:25.340- 19:26.640* :  who dragged them in the car.
*19:26.960- 19:27.500* :  We have videos.
*19:27.500- 19:28.680* :  We have their cell phone numbers.
*19:28.780- 19:29.560* :  We know who they are.
*19:29.560- 19:30.960* :  We can eliminate them, yeah, sure.
*19:31.780- 19:33.220* :  And I think we can eliminate Hamas.
*19:33.320- 19:36.140* :  What do you see a future in which there can be peace
*19:36.140- 19:38.740* :  with the Palestinian state alongside Israel?
*19:39.260- 19:39.840* :  Yeah, of course.
*19:40.260- 19:42.380* :  I think that's the only solution of a two-state solution.
*19:43.160- 19:45.000* :  Palestinian state for the Palestinian people.
*19:45.740- 19:47.540* :  And then I hope that like in two to four years
*19:47.540- 19:49.480* :  we'll be able to do peace and build two states
*19:49.920- 19:52.580* :  for the two people and be able to live together next to each other.
*19:53.120- 19:54.980* :  Do you think about the parents and Gaza
*19:54.980- 19:56.480* :  who are losing their children now?
*19:57.140- 19:57.360* :  Of course.
*19:58.420- 19:59.420* :  Okay, every loss is a loss.
*20:01.460- 20:03.000* :  But everyone that's responsible
*20:03.440- 20:05.520* :  for what happened in October 7th will be eliminated.
*20:05.880- 20:07.220* :  And that's something that we need to understand.
*20:08.000- 20:09.000* :  They cannot stay alive.
*20:09.920- 20:12.400* :  What kind of future did you imagine for her?
*20:12.980- 20:13.460* :  It's interesting.
*20:13.500- 20:15.780* :  Like I think we can have before they were murdered.
*20:16.380- 20:19.080* :  Said you know that I decided I'm going to marry No.
*20:19.820- 20:23.280* :  They were going to live up north in the country raising kids.
*20:23.660- 20:24.520* :  She wanted many kids.
*20:25.440- 20:26.940* :  With a lot of dogs, horses.
*20:28.160- 20:29.860* :  They were like for six years together
*20:29.860- 20:32.200* :  in an amazing partnership.
*20:33.380- 20:35.380* :  No, I mean, then they were like a great example
*20:36.120- 20:37.560* :  of how you should live together as a couple.
*20:38.140- 20:40.700* :  Why understand they were buried together?
*20:41.340- 20:44.340* :  Yeah, we decided with the norm's parents
*20:45.440- 20:47.560* :  that best is that we bury them together.
*20:47.980- 20:48.960* :  Instead of getting them married.
*20:51.340- 20:54.640* :  El Walden speaking there to the BBC's Orlegaire.
*20:56.480- 21:00.100* :  For years Afganistan held the record of being the world leader
*21:00.100- 21:03.260* :  in producing opium, the key ingredient for heroin
*21:03.600- 21:05.020* :  and other strong drugs.
*21:05.580- 21:07.880* :  But since the Taliban authorities banned
*21:08.140- 21:09.500* :  poppy cultivation last year,
*21:09.900- 21:11.800* :  Warnmar has overtaken Afganistan,
*21:11.800- 21:16.360* :  where the amount of opium produced has slumped by as much as 95%.
*21:17.200- 21:19.900* :  I asked Asia-Pacific regional editor Celia Hatten
*21:20.200- 21:23.220* :  why opium production is on the rise in Warnmar.
*21:23.920- 21:27.820* :  Violet really comes down to what's going on inside Myanmar.
*21:27.820- 21:30.960* :  You'll remember that almost three years ago
*21:30.960- 21:35.040* :  there was a coup there and the military
*21:35.040- 21:39.080* :  agenda that took power really doesn't have a very good grip
*21:39.080- 21:42.480* :  on what's happening that coup is still being rejected.
*21:42.540- 21:46.540* :  Lots of fighting across Myanmar from different factions.
*21:46.740- 21:50.060* :  And so really what's happened is the economy has tanked
*21:50.120- 21:53.720* :  and that's led farmers to make the tough decision.
*21:53.720- 21:58.620* :  They had turned away perhaps from growing poppies years ago.
*21:58.740- 22:02.420* :  I mean at one point Myanmar was also known for opium production
*22:02.460- 22:03.560* :  about 20 years ago.
*22:04.020- 22:06.820* :  Now lots of those farmers are making the choice to go back
*22:06.820- 22:09.520* :  to growing poppies to producing opium
*22:09.920- 22:12.720* :  because they simply don't have a choice they feel.
*22:12.720- 22:15.240* :  And there are a lot of drug lords in the region
*22:15.240- 22:20.200* :  who are taking advantage of this lack of government in Myanmar.
*22:20.200- 22:22.920* :  There's no real group in controls there.
*22:23.100- 22:24.860* :  And they're sort of filling the vacuum
*22:24.860- 22:27.740* :  in order to encourage farmers to produce
*22:27.740- 22:30.220* :  what they want for drug production and trafficking.
*22:30.620- 22:32.200* :  Cecilia you're saying there's a vacuum.
*22:32.200- 22:36.420* :  Are the authorities Myanmar are they trying to tackle this issue?
*22:37.020- 22:41.500* :  Well I'm they've released a few sort of minor statements saying they are.
*22:41.500- 22:45.000* :  But you know the real problem I mean the UN even says
*22:45.000- 22:48.720* :  in the region the UN office on drugs and crime based in Bangkok
*22:48.720- 22:51.360* :  says that drug production and trafficking
*22:51.360- 22:54.920* :  is really staggering in the golden triangle.
*22:54.920- 22:56.500* :  The scale of it is staggering.
*22:56.960- 23:00.920* :  Now the golden triangle is that famous kind of drug production
*23:00.920- 23:05.880* :  region drug corridor that goes from Myanmar to Thailand to Laos.
*23:06.140- 23:08.600* :  It's a very jungly terrain.
*23:08.600- 23:11.540* :  It's governed by very well-armed war lords.
*23:11.540- 23:14.500* :  And what's really happened in the past few years is that organized crime
*23:14.500- 23:19.180* :  has joined up with these war lords in order to increase
*23:19.180- 23:23.420* :  not just trafficking and production of opium and heroin
*23:23.420- 23:26.840* :  but also really in synthetic drugs like methamphetamines.
*23:27.240- 23:31.200* :  And so the problem is that it's very difficult to tackle
*23:31.200- 23:35.240* :  which group is in power and also just the geography is so tough.
*23:35.260- 23:39.360* :  So the one bright light I think is that China and Thailand have really tried
*23:39.360- 23:41.860* :  to step up controls and step up
*23:42.320- 23:45.100* :  tackling the trafficking that's going on.
*23:45.100- 23:47.300* :  But really it's a very very difficult problem.
*23:47.300- 23:50.360* :  That's why this is one of the world's biggest drug corridors.
*23:50.900- 23:51.620* :  Silia Hatton.
*23:52.240- 23:55.040* :  Some really positive conservation use now.
*23:55.660- 23:59.880* :  More than 90% of the Saiga Antelope population was lost to poaching
*24:00.280- 24:02.360* :  following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
*24:02.820- 24:04.420* :  The species was critically endangered.
*24:04.420- 24:07.080* :  Now it's described as near threatened.
*24:07.140- 24:10.820* :  And that's a jump of two categories away from disaster.
*24:11.500- 24:14.440* :  Here's what one of those Saiga Antelopes sounds like.
*24:14.920- 24:18.200* :  This is from the BBC TV program Planet Earth 3.
*24:24.260- 24:25.420* :  Saiga Antelope.
*24:27.320- 24:31.760* :  Small but tough animals that lived alongside woolly mammoths.
*24:37.700- 24:41.480* :  A male's enormous nose both filters out the dust
*24:41.820- 24:45.260* :  and warms up the cold air before it reaches his lungs.
*24:48.400- 24:49.920* :  The biologist David Attenborough
*24:50.460- 24:51.740* :  and a Saiga Antelope.
*24:51.920- 24:55.260* :  Well, E.J. Milner-Gulland, a professor at Oxford University
*24:55.680- 24:57.920* :  and founder of the Saiga Conservation Alliance,
*24:57.960- 25:01.940* :  told Justin Webb how they turned the prospect for the Saiga around.
*25:02.780- 25:06.540* :  It's an amazing milestone and it's a real testament to working together
*25:06.540- 25:09.120* :  over 20 years to get this far.
*25:09.400- 25:10.120* :  What did you do?
*25:10.800- 25:12.620* :  We came together as a group of academics,
*25:12.620- 25:17.440* :  governments and NGOs to make a memorandum of understanding.
*25:17.440- 25:19.120* :  That sounds really boring and dry,
*25:19.120- 25:21.720* :  but it means that everyone is pulling the same direction,
*25:22.400- 25:24.580* :  including governments who are able to direct money
*25:24.620- 25:25.800* :  to where it's really needed.
*25:27.320- 25:31.220* :  When it came to the actual behavior of people
*25:31.220- 25:36.000* :  that had been threatening this species so much and needed to change,
*25:36.720- 25:39.720* :  who had to be convinced and how did you do it?
*25:40.520- 25:41.840* :  Well, the whole of society really,
*25:41.840- 25:44.920* :  so there are local people who live in these incredibly remote areas
*25:44.920- 25:46.500* :  alongside the Saiga and really,
*25:46.920- 25:48.500* :  you know, whatever you say up on high,
*25:48.840- 25:51.180* :  they'll do whatever they want to do in the steps.
*25:51.320- 25:55.220* :  And so, you know, they have to be able to move away from
*25:55.240- 25:57.820* :  poaching Saigas into some other livelihoods.
*25:57.880- 26:00.540* :  And that, because this whole problem started with the breakup
*26:00.540- 26:02.820* :  of the Soviet Union when people were very poor
*26:03.060- 26:06.420* :  and there were people coming in to try to export horns to China.
*26:06.420- 26:09.380* :  So, they had this huge pull towards poaching.
*26:09.960- 26:12.540* :  And now, after 20 years, things have eased a little bit,
*26:12.920- 26:15.880* :  but also there's been heavy work by the government in anti-poaching.
*26:16.820- 26:17.680* :  They sound cute.
*26:18.200- 26:20.380* :  I mean, does that help?
*26:21.240- 26:21.980* :  They're unusual.
*26:22.800- 26:23.760* :  I mean, I think they're cute.
*26:23.760- 26:25.720* :  I'm not sure that everybody would think that they were cute.
*26:26.360- 26:29.160* :  I think they are a cultural symbol of the step
*26:29.160- 26:32.060* :  because they roam these huge distances.
*26:32.060- 26:34.720* :  And for people who live in step areas,
*26:34.920- 26:36.240* :  you know, they're pretty special.
*26:36.240- 26:39.060* :  They symbolise the freedom to move.
*26:40.040- 26:41.620* :  So, it doesn't really matter what we in the West
*26:41.640- 26:42.660* :  think about whether they're cute.
*26:42.660- 26:45.720* :  What matters is what people who are living with them think.
*26:45.900- 26:47.420* :  Yeah, and they wanted them to be there.
*26:47.420- 26:48.300* :  And that's really important.
*26:48.300- 26:50.160* :  Actually, there's a wider question there.
*26:50.160- 26:52.400* :  Isn't there about the extent to which people
*26:53.020- 26:55.540* :  can be brought on board for conservation
*26:55.620- 26:59.780* :  when a species matters to them and matters to them culturally?
*27:00.920- 27:03.200* :  Yeah, and actually, I was out in the step in Maine,
*27:03.200- 27:06.500* :  Kazakhstan, where there's been huge increase in numbers.
*27:06.720- 27:08.080* :  And people are very concerned about
*27:08.080- 27:10.920* :  tigers eating their pastures and competing for water
*27:11.360- 27:14.040* :  and potentially, you know, sharing diseases with livestock.
*27:14.500- 27:17.120* :  And those farmers were really facing, you know,
*27:17.140- 27:18.460* :  difficulties in their livelihoods.
*27:18.460- 27:21.940* :  And yet, these antelopes were completely safe.
*27:21.980- 27:23.340* :  They were not being hunted.
*27:23.700- 27:26.840* :  I saw them right next to villages grazing amongst livestock.
*27:26.840- 27:29.500* :  So, you know, if people really care about a species,
*27:29.500- 27:32.760* :  they'll go a long way towards making sure that they survive.
*27:33.100- 27:36.040* :  Professor E.J. Milner-Gallant of the Saiga Conservation Alliance
*27:36.040- 27:37.800* :  talking there to Justin Webb.
*27:39.280- 27:42.680* :  And finally, we end this global news podcast with the news
*27:42.680- 27:45.400* :  that one of South Africa's most celebrated musicians,
*27:45.420- 27:47.260* :  Sahara, has died.
*27:47.260- 27:51.240* :  She was only 36 and had been receiving treatment for liver problems.
*27:51.960- 27:54.300* :  The singer-songwriter, who taught herself guitar,
*27:54.760- 27:58.160* :  gained fame back in 2011 with her hit song, Lolliver.
*28:10.780- 28:13.340* :  Well, Sahara went on to release five albums,
*28:13.340- 28:15.380* :  sold more than half a million records,
*28:15.840- 28:17.200* :  and won dozens of awards.
*28:17.260- 28:21.360* :  In 2020, she was named in the BBC's 100 Women List,
*28:21.680- 28:23.200* :  not only for her musical achievements,
*28:23.200- 28:26.960* :  but also for speaking out about violence against women in South Africa,
*28:27.560- 28:30.160* :  after revealing that she had been a victim too.
*28:32.940- 28:35.220* :  They feel like they're entitled to women.
*28:35.420- 28:37.400* :  Like, women, they're theirs.
*28:39.560- 28:41.100* :  It doesn't really matter what you do, what you want with your life,
*28:41.100- 28:43.500* :  and you're drinking, they don't care about our dreams,
*28:43.680- 28:45.660* :  men in South Africa.
*28:45.960- 28:46.420* :  All they care about is them, what they want.
*28:46.700- 28:50.340* :  I studied the foundation, which is called the Zaraan,
*28:50.860- 28:56.120* :  where I hope the uncle's from 13 to 12 years old,
*28:57.700- 28:59.380* :  and I'm sure he's not going to be a victim of violence.
*28:59.380- 28:59.880* :  He's just called the Zaraan,
*29:00.520- 29:03.360* :  where I hope the uncle's from 13 to 25.
*29:04.540- 29:07.020* :  I give them guitars, but I'm not giving them guitars
*29:07.020- 29:09.180* :  so that they can be another Sahara's,
*29:09.720- 29:12.020* :  but a guitar for me is a symbol of hope.
*29:13.020- 29:14.900* :  So I wanted them to have that symbol of hope,
*29:14.900- 29:18.840* :  because I know I'm a young woman, I was a little girl.
*29:19.600- 29:23.260* :  I know what we go through when it comes to the things of life.
*29:24.120- 29:26.680* :  What I can say to them, do not keep quiet,
*29:27.840- 29:29.960* :  because at the end of the day it does not help you.
*29:31.260- 29:32.440* :  It kills you inside.
*29:33.060- 29:36.980* :  My hope for the future for young women in South Africa.
*29:37.660- 29:40.360* :  I wish you can actually look at yourself
*29:40.360- 29:41.760* :  and look what you were born for
*29:42.140- 29:44.540* :  and walk towards what you were born for.
*29:45.800- 29:49.160* :  One of South Africa's most celebrated musicians, Zahara,
*29:49.580- 29:52.080* :  who has died at the age of just 36.
*29:54.640- 29:55.520* :  And that's it from us for now,
*29:55.520- 29:58.360* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
