*01:43.520- 01:50.260* :  Service. I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday the 13th of December, these are our
*01:50.260- 01:56.580* :  main stories. A case of good cop, bad cop, as delegates at the UN Climate Summit in Dubai finally
*01:56.580- 02:02.200* :  reach agreement on fossil fuels. But some call it a death certificate. Experts warn that Sudan is
*02:02.200- 02:07.440* :  heading towards what's been called a hunger catastrophe after months of conflict. Protesters have
*02:07.440- 02:12.560* :  broken into the Indian Parliament leaping from the visitor's gallery and setting off a smoke canister.
*02:14.700- 02:19.380* :  Also in this podcast. In the TV show it's like he's this
*02:19.900- 02:24.540* :  psychotic killer but there's this deeper side to him. How Netflix's universe of
*02:24.540- 02:29.820* :  Stranger Things is opening up a whole new chapter in a whole new format.
*02:33.640- 02:38.100* :  A new deal has been agreed at the UN Climate Summit in Dubai after days of negotiations.
*02:38.280- 02:42.500* :  For the first time the agreement calls on all countries to move away from using
*02:42.500- 02:48.360* :  fossil fuels. The United States Climate Envoy John Kerry said it showed commitment to limit
*02:48.360- 02:55.900* :  global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This document sends very strong messages to the world.
*02:56.360- 03:03.420* :  First, the document highlights that we have to adhere to keeping 1.5 degrees within reach
*03:03.740- 03:11.080* :  that is the North Star and we therefore must do those things necessary to keep the 1.5.
*03:11.640- 03:15.400* :  Everything we can to achieve this goal. But not everyone is convinced.
*03:15.500- 03:21.200* :  The head of the Marshall Island delegation John Silk compared the deal to a leaky sea vessel.
*03:21.840- 03:26.960* :  Mr. President, that's a long season. I came from my home island to work with you
*03:28.020- 03:33.700* :  all to solve the greatest challenge of our generation. I came here to build a canoe together
*03:34.100- 03:40.560* :  for my country. Instead we had built a canoe with a weakened leaky hull full of holes.
*03:42.040- 03:45.760* :  Yet we have to put it into the water because we have no other option.
*03:46.320- 03:51.520* :  I spoke to our environment correspondent Matt McGraw and asked him if the deal really is a breakthrough.
*03:52.140- 03:57.440* :  A breakthrough is a very strong word. I think it is an interesting progression on the road.
*03:57.440- 04:02.420* :  It's probably the most significant climate deal that's been done since the Paris Agreement
*04:02.420- 04:08.880* :  was signed eight years ago in 2015. So people have been using words like historic and breakthrough
*04:08.880- 04:14.480* :  as you said. I'm not quite sure it meets those particular high points. It is certainly
*04:14.480- 04:19.060* :  progress and compared to where the parties were two days ago when there was no mention of the
*04:19.060- 04:23.900* :  end of fossil fuels at all. I think many people will consider it a bit of a win.
*04:24.800- 04:30.780* :  It is calling for countries to transition away from using fossil fuels. I mean, what does that mean?
*04:32.620- 04:38.980* :  Yes, indeed. It's a very not a very strong phrase to use in that sense. I think that particular
*04:38.980- 04:43.640* :  key part of it is much more strong than what had been there previously, which was nothing,
*04:43.640- 04:48.160* :  essentially. Countries could do a number of different things. Now they're being called on to
*04:48.160- 04:53.860* :  transition away from fossil fuels in the energy sector. But it puts it in the framework of taking
*04:53.860- 04:59.220* :  a lot of reproduction in the next number of years, tripling renewable energy by 2030, doubling energy
*04:59.220- 05:05.800* :  efficiency. Everybody has to put new plans on the table by 2025, strong plans that keep the 1.5
*05:05.800- 05:12.200* :  goal in sight, and everybody has to get an it's zero by 2050. So it's soft in the language.
*05:12.620- 05:17.100* :  It's not the hardest move away from fossil fuels that there could have been. Our people here would
*05:17.100- 05:25.100* :  have wanted it to be. But I think it's signaling a major change on the road to that phase out,
*05:25.520- 05:30.260* :  on the road to that phase down over the next number of decades. You've covered many of these
*05:30.400- 05:34.740* :  summits. What else has struck you about this final agreement and indeed this whole summit?
*05:35.160- 05:40.060* :  I think it's interesting here that, you know, people and delegates are very practical minded.
*05:40.140- 05:44.140* :  And I think they're seeing this as a step and they're not willing to die in the road for
*05:44.800- 05:49.060* :  this particular agreement. I think they see it as a step on the road to ending fossil fuels.
*05:49.060- 05:52.960* :  And I think that's clear in the text that it does signal that there are many caveats,
*05:53.000- 05:57.540* :  many get out of jail cards undoubtedly there are. But I think people here are seeing this as part
*05:57.540- 06:02.860* :  of a trilogy, if you like, next year the cop goes to Azerbaijan, they will discuss finance there
*06:03.080- 06:07.100* :  and the year after it goes to Brazil where I think all these elements may come together under
*06:07.100- 06:13.480* :  the Brazilian presidency in 2025. I think that's potentially the next big, big moment when countries
*06:13.480- 06:18.280* :  will really have an opportunity to put the right finance on the table to help countries adapt
*06:18.640- 06:21.960* :  and also perhaps to get a stronger signal on the end of fossil fuels.
*06:22.660- 06:27.500* :  And I suppose anyone listening to this map will think, is it actually going to do anything
*06:27.500- 06:32.940* :  to limit temperature rises on the planet to 1.5 degrees Celsius?
*06:33.560- 06:38.740* :  I think that's the very big question. I think it's in the short term, the answer to that is no.
*06:39.580- 06:44.520* :  But in the longer term, the direction of travel is clear here. And if in the next five to
*06:44.520- 06:49.020* :  seven years as scientists are blue in the face from saying, countries really get a grip on their
*06:49.020- 06:54.060* :  emissions, then it keeps that 1.5 within reach. That's the phrase that's used now within reach.
*06:54.460- 06:59.860* :  So I think it does signal more cuts, more ambition from different countries and an ultimate end
*06:59.860- 07:06.940* :  to the use of fossil fuels. Matt McGraw in Dubai. There's a warning that parts of Sudan are at
*07:06.940- 07:11.980* :  risk of slipping into what's being called catastrophic hunger conditions. The country has been in
*07:11.980- 07:17.040* :  the grip of a conflict lasting eight months. The World Food Programme says that 18 million people
*07:17.040- 07:22.040* :  in Sudan are facing acute levels of hunger, more than double the number of a year ago.
*07:22.860- 07:28.180* :  Five million people across Sudan have been displaced both inside and outside the country since April.
*07:28.740- 07:32.720* :  A senior Africa correspondent Anne Sawett told me about the effect of the civil war.
*07:33.260- 07:38.580* :  It's been huge and devastating. As you said, there's the highest levels of hunger ever recorded.
*07:39.020- 07:44.260* :  And this is the harvest season from October to around February, when usually they have food
*07:44.260- 07:50.200* :  during the year. But now, since almost everything has been disrupted and you cannot transport anything
*07:50.200- 07:56.660* :  in much of the country, it means that people are going hungry. And those who would be able to help
*07:56.660- 08:01.460* :  the aid agencies have not been able to reach the vast majority of people of the worst affected
*08:01.460- 08:06.620* :  places, including the capital, Khartoum, where the fighting started. The World Food Programme says
*08:06.620- 08:12.000* :  that in the last three months, it has only managed to access Khartoum once during a lullian fighting.
*08:12.880- 08:17.740* :  A few days ago, we heard from the International Council of the Red Cross saying that one of their
*08:17.740- 08:23.840* :  convoys came under attack even after they had negotiated access. So such is the situation for
*08:23.840- 08:29.300* :  the aid agencies and civilians have been caught up in all this. So it's very dangerous for the aid
*08:29.300- 08:34.980* :  agencies. Is it also happening that aid is being looted? Aid is being looted as well. We're talking
*08:34.980- 08:39.960* :  about funding shortfalls that have made it very difficult for aid agencies to raise enough.
*08:40.500- 08:45.060* :  So even with the little that they have, it's very difficult to distribute. It's very dangerous
*08:45.060- 08:51.860* :  for their teams. So if you can't reach people, how do you help them? It's extremely difficult. And so
*08:51.860- 08:56.340* :  they're saying, you know, the only way to reach people, they're trying to negotiate to the two
*08:56.980- 09:01.960* :  sides, the regional block Iga Iga, is leading some of the negotiations, political negotiations.
*09:01.960- 09:07.620* :  Over the weekend, they announced a breakthrough, but shortly after that, General Burhan, who is the
*09:07.620- 09:14.060* :  defacto leader of Sudan and leads at the National Army, one of the war infections, disowned that
*09:14.060- 09:18.900* :  alleged breakthrough and said he is now vowed that he will continue fighting either to victory or
*09:18.900- 09:26.560* :  martyrdom. So the future looks bleak of pro Sudan on the fighting front as well as on the political
*09:26.560- 09:31.340* :  front. And that just means more suffering for the people of Sudan. And there are lots of people
*09:31.660- 09:38.000* :  living. A lot of people living already 6.3 or 6.5 million have been displaced, many of them
*09:38.000- 09:42.280* :  within the country. Those who have made it outside the country are going to countries that
*09:42.280- 09:48.720* :  already fragile, like Libya, like Chad. So things are already difficult there. Some of the areas
*09:48.720- 09:54.580* :  have been cut off by floods because of the ongoing rains. And so it's difficult to reach them,
*09:54.580- 10:00.420* :  even when they manage to flee the country. And so to India next, whether it's been a security
*10:00.420- 10:03.620* :  scare after two intruders stormed the Parliament chamber.
*10:10.220- 10:13.480* :  Kagali Gosh Dastida is an MP who saw what happened.
*10:13.920- 10:18.740* :  From galleries, they came into the jump into the Lok Sabha and they started shouting slogans
*10:18.740- 10:23.920* :  and they are spreading some gas inside, they are running about in the Lok Sabha, inside the house.
*10:24.360- 10:28.000* :  Asathesha Regional Editor and Barasan Ethirachan told me more.
*10:28.340- 10:33.200* :  There were some dramatic scenes in the lower house of Indian Parliament this morning,
*10:33.200- 10:39.660* :  while the session was on. All of a sudden, a man jumped from the public gallery and he was running
*10:39.660- 10:45.560* :  over the desks. And soon after one of the MPs said that there was also another man. So they
*10:45.560- 10:50.680* :  were all trying to catch them. Initially they thought this man accidentally fell from the gallery.
*10:50.680- 10:56.020* :  This is the new Parliament building, but then later on they realized these two people were shouting
*10:56.020- 11:02.100* :  slogans and then they were trying to run over the desks, then the other MPs tried to catch them.
*11:02.580- 11:08.740* :  And then they set off gas can, which emitted yellow smoke. So there was a bit of a confusion for
*11:08.740- 11:13.920* :  a few minutes, but then the MPs were able to overpower these people and then by that time the
*11:13.920- 11:19.400* :  security ran into the chamber and then took them into custody. While all this was happening a
*11:19.400- 11:24.680* :  few minutes later, there was also a commotion outside the Parliament building, two other people,
*11:24.720- 11:30.880* :  including a woman. We're setting off this yellow gas canisters and then raising slogans about
*11:30.880- 11:36.620* :  what the Indian media says down with the dictatorship and also they spoke about unemployment.
*11:36.620- 11:39.000* :  So on Barasan, what do we know about them?
*11:39.340- 11:44.880* :  The initial details are sketchy and a couple of people are from the southern Indian state of
*11:45.000- 11:52.080* :  Karnataka and some from northern India. So they were given passes by the MPs, usually what happens is
*11:52.080- 11:57.940* :  your local MP or any other MP can issue a pass so that you can go and visit these galleries
*11:57.940- 12:03.980* :  to watch the proceedings in the lower house of Parliament. So as far as now the authorities are
*12:03.980- 12:10.440* :  saying there are no any terror angle or there was no intention of causing any big damage,
*12:11.140- 12:17.180* :  but it is seen as a major security breach because this is in the most protected place in the
*12:17.660- 12:23.200* :  Indian capital that is Indian Parliament. So several MPs after this incident was over they were all
*12:23.200- 12:29.200* :  questioning the government and also complaining to the Speaker of the House on how this can be
*12:29.200- 12:36.800* :  allowed to happen. The most important thing was this was also today was the anniversary of the 2001
*12:37.100- 12:42.640* :  attack on Indian Parliament that set off a big tensions between India and Pakistan. So they were
*12:42.640- 12:48.400* :  asking the government to come out with a clear and detailed report on how this was allowed to happen.
*12:48.980- 12:55.040* :  And Barasan Atherajan, top executives at Chinese property developer Country Garden are having
*12:55.040- 13:01.020* :  their salaries cut back as the company continues to struggle with colossal debts amid a wider crisis
*13:01.020- 13:05.800* :  in the Chinese real estate sector. His are Asia business correspondent Nick Marsh.
*13:06.580- 13:11.680* :  It's the third time in two years that Country Garden executives have had their pay reduced.
*13:12.380- 13:19.580* :  In that time the salary of chief executive Mo Bin has dropped from 2.1 million dollars a year
*13:19.580- 13:28.000* :  to just 16,000. It's a drop in the ocean compared to the 186 billion dollars of debt that the
*13:28.000- 13:33.400* :  company is currently facing. But it's a sign of how bad things are in China's property market
*13:33.400- 13:39.680* :  more broadly. It's become a major political headache for Beijing. As many people in China typically
*13:39.680- 13:47.700* :  invest their life savings in property. Nick Marsh. The sci-fi horror stranger things has become one of
*13:47.700- 13:53.780* :  the most watched English language series in Netflix history. Set in the 1980s it follows the
*13:53.780- 13:59.800* :  supernatural events which take place in the small US time of Hawkins, Indiana. Now it's been turned
*13:59.800- 14:04.720* :  into a stage show a prequel to the TV drama packed with stunts and lighting effects.
*14:05.400- 14:09.080* :  Our correspondent Charlotte Gallagher went to meet two of its main cast members,
*14:09.540- 14:14.700* :  Louis McCartney, who plays Henry Creel and Ella Caruno Williams, who plays Patti Williams.
*14:18.080- 14:23.200* :  From Hawkins, Indiana to London's West End, the stranger things phenomenon
*14:24.300- 14:30.660* :  continues. A new play which explores the origins of one of the program's supervillains opened this
*14:30.660- 14:37.760* :  week. I didn't fit in with the other children. Something was wrong with me. The story revolves around
*14:37.760- 14:46.200* :  Henry Creel, a strange child who becomes a monster. Most people fear spiders. Playing Henry Creel
*14:46.200- 14:51.980* :  is really fun. What we've been exploring as a young person, a young Henry Creel, is in the TV
*14:51.980- 14:56.520* :  show. It's like he's this psychotic killer and that's sometimes how he's told as the story or
*14:56.520- 15:00.720* :  like shown to the audience. But there's this deeper side to him that works for him that maybe
*15:00.860- 15:07.480* :  it wasn't as plain as it seems like there's other factors as people around him and Henry's too
*15:07.480- 15:12.940* :  smart for his own good and thanks too much. And just what's the recursions of that and how does that
*15:12.940- 15:17.260* :  affect him in the world? And you're a new character aren't you? Your stranger things fans
*15:17.260- 15:21.740* :  might have seen you before you're being introduced in this. It's really exciting, yeah. I don't know
*15:21.740- 15:27.440* :  how much I can say about her. I don't want to give too much away, but she is Henry's love interest
*15:27.620- 15:35.260* :  and she I would describe her as on a journey of self-discovery, a bit nerdy, a bit sassy,
*15:36.720- 15:39.200* :  but again struggling with her own internal demons.
*15:39.420- 15:48.400* :  The play is shrouded in secrecy, but the show is one of Netflix's biggest hits. So what's it
*15:48.400- 15:54.480* :  like joining the Stranger Things universe? Oh, it's just like confetti in my brain. It's just
*15:54.480- 16:00.500* :  the insane one. It's my boy. It's crazy. If you watch the series, you'll know it's full of
*16:00.500- 16:05.500* :  1980s nostalgia. This show is going to take you back to the 1950s.
*16:08.880- 16:14.940* :  Taking Stranger Things from screen to stage has been a long process, but rehearsals are over,
*16:15.220- 16:21.480* :  and it's ready for its opening night. Charlotte Gallagher chatting there to Louis McCartney and
*16:21.480- 16:26.800* :  Ella Caruno Williams. Still to calm on the podcast.
*16:31.220- 16:35.240* :  Why the bloodthirsty cats of Valdorf are being put on perfume.
*16:42.080- 16:46.940* :  Hello, I'm Katya Adler, and this is the global story from the BBC World Service.
*16:46.940- 16:51.080* :  China and America came together at a greed on this climate issue.
*16:51.140- 16:56.020* :  We're here to look beyond the headlines, peel back lazy assumptions and give you a fresh
*16:56.020- 17:01.920* :  global perspective on the stories that matter. Is Europe tiring in terms of its support for
*17:01.920- 17:06.340* :  Ukraine? There will have to be some kind of negotiation to end this war.
*17:06.780- 17:11.820* :  Search for the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts. The number of people
*17:11.820- 17:16.880* :  forced to flee their homes because of conflict or persecution has reached a record high this
*17:16.880- 17:22.700* :  year, worth 110 million. Now the UN is urging countries to do more to help them.
*17:22.900- 17:27.120* :  At the start of a three-day summit in Geneva, the head of the UN's refugee agency,
*17:27.120- 17:32.300* :  Philippe Grande warned there was a severe shortfall in funding, a facility grows in
*17:32.300- 17:40.420* :  western countries towards refugees. Let's remember that most refugees, 75% to be precise,
*17:40.420- 17:47.040* :  are hosted by low and middle-income countries, often already struggling themselves to provide
*17:47.040- 17:54.940* :  and care for their own citizens. This is why international support is so key and must be reinforced.
*17:55.840- 18:00.800* :  Well, the global news podcast, Janet Jaliel, is at the summit and to be more about what
*18:00.800- 18:06.720* :  it's hoping to achieve. Never before have we seen so many refugees and displaced people partly
*18:06.720- 18:12.620* :  because of conflicts like Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza, but also increasingly because of climate change.
*18:12.960- 18:17.600* :  So that's why the UN is hosting this huge forum with thousands of delegates, including world
*18:17.600- 18:24.040* :  leaders, to address one of the biggest challenges of our age. The first such refugee forum was four
*18:24.040- 18:29.100* :  years ago, yet in that time the numbers forced to flee their homes have only risen ever higher.
*18:29.680- 18:34.360* :  But instead of more help, international funding to support refugees is actually fallen,
*18:34.840- 18:39.260* :  and we've seen anti-immigrant parties and politicians gaining support in western nations
*18:39.260- 18:44.860* :  because of a perception that they're being swamped by refugees. And Jordan's king Abdullah told
*18:44.860- 18:49.100* :  this forum that it's actually lower income countries like his that are doing the most
*18:49.100- 18:54.060* :  to support refugees. He said, for example, this is placed huge pressure on Jordan's scarce water
*18:54.060- 18:59.520* :  resources. So the aim of this conference is to encourage pledges to help refugees to try to tackle
*18:59.520- 19:03.920* :  the root causes, but also to help to ease the pressure on nations like Jordan, Bangladesh,
*19:03.920- 19:08.560* :  Colombia and Uganda, where the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees are based.
*19:08.880- 19:16.060* :  And one of the biggest controversies in this area right now is UK plans to send refugees to
*19:16.060- 19:21.340* :  a wonder. What's being said about that? Yes, that's been in the news a lot. A plan that was blocked
*19:21.700- 19:25.900* :  by Britain's top court last month, which the government is pushing through parliament.
*19:25.900- 19:32.300* :  At the same time, Britain has made fresh pledges of financial help for refugees at this conference,
*19:32.300- 19:39.680* :  the international development minister was here. Andrew Mitchell, the money being offered to give help
*19:39.680- 19:45.500* :  to refugees in Africa, for example, with education and skills is tiny compared to the money that UK
*19:45.500- 19:52.100* :  has spent on its controversial Rwanda plan, more than $300 million so far. Even though not a single
*19:52.100- 19:58.520* :  asylum seeker has yet been deported to Rwanda, nevertheless, Mr Mitchell defended his plan.
*19:58.860- 20:05.220* :  When it comes to Rwanda, I would completely reject your assertion that this is not a safe country.
*20:05.640- 20:11.200* :  The UN High Commission for Refugees submitted a lot of evidence to the British courts against
*20:11.200- 20:20.060* :  Rwanda, but the day after the decision was made, the UNHCR took over 160 people by plane to Rwanda
*20:20.060- 20:25.760* :  from Libya. They would never have done that if they did not regard Rwanda as a safe country.
*20:26.080- 20:30.580* :  But the UNHCR says deporting refugees or building walls to keep them out or ignoring
*20:30.580- 20:36.460* :  international human rights law is a distraction from serious efforts that are needed to help share
*20:36.460- 20:41.280* :  the responsibility of helping refugees. And the summit will be hearing, won't it, from refugees
*20:41.280- 20:46.720* :  themselves? Yes, there are a number of speakers and there has been a big focus on getting refugees
*20:46.720- 20:51.820* :  to tell their own stories. For instance, there's an Afghan woman who became an Olympic cyclist who's
*20:51.820- 20:57.220* :  addressing this summit, a refugee from South Sudan who hosts the radio show at his refugee camp in
*20:57.220- 21:02.040* :  Kenya, and a very high profile former displaced person who's the Colombian Vice President,
*21:02.040- 21:07.660* :  Francia Marquez, who before she entered politics was an environmental activist and was forced to
*21:07.660- 21:12.600* :  flee her home with her children after death threats from illegal minors. So we're going to have a
*21:12.600- 21:19.080* :  wide range of voices, including from the people most affected themselves. Janet Gillil in Geneva.
*21:20.200- 21:25.220* :  One of the British armies first Rastafarian soldiers has won a claim of race discrimination and
*21:25.220- 21:31.300* :  harassment against the Ministry of Defence here in the UK. Dwight Pyle Gray, who was a member of
*21:31.300- 21:36.400* :  the band of the Grenadier Guards, was accused of playing the race card when he tried to enter his
*21:36.400- 21:42.980* :  barracks. The white guard on duty, he says, didn't believe he could be a soldier. Mr. Pyle Gray,
*21:42.980- 21:48.560* :  who's given his first broadcast interview to the BBC, says his case shows that in the army,
*21:48.560- 21:53.800* :  it's worse to accuse someone of racism than it is to be a racist. He spoke to our defence
*21:53.800- 22:04.440* :  correspondent Jonathan Biel. I was the first raster with locks to join the British army in 2005,
*22:04.440- 22:12.460* :  so I was under no illusion as to what I might encounter, but I joined at 37 years old. I joined
*22:12.460- 22:18.380* :  for a purpose and to play the hall and I knew that I was going to be able to do that, and I joined
*22:18.380- 22:27.120* :  with incredible optimism that things could only be better having joined. What was the experience of
*22:27.120- 22:34.000* :  being a black raster fair in the British army the first in those 16, 17 years? Some people were
*22:34.000- 22:39.000* :  really interested and wanted to talk to me and find out about things, but some people wanted,
*22:39.000- 22:47.600* :  I felt wanted to trip me up, ask me questions such as, how do you get away with that hair?
*22:48.100- 22:52.340* :  And what about in terms of overt racism? I had experience of people using the
*22:52.340- 23:00.120* :  N word and people referring to the size of my genitals because I'm a black guy and all of that
*23:00.120- 23:08.840* :  kind of stuff. What people would say, well, it's just banter. Is it banter? Let's talk about the
*23:08.840- 23:16.860* :  events in July 2021. I'd left my ID card inside. I spoke to the guy on the
*23:16.860- 23:21.580* :  gate and said, look, I've left my ID inside, but his reaction was that he didn't believe.
*23:22.200- 23:29.240* :  He actually stuck his head in back into the garden and said, this gentleman thinks he's left
*23:29.240- 23:35.600* :  his ID inside in kind of air quotes. Does anybody know him? I was absolutely treated differently
*23:35.600- 23:40.520* :  because of my appearance. There's no doubt in my mind, I've been doing this a long time and I
*23:40.520- 23:48.040* :  understand when there is a racial element to an interaction. They accused me of playing the race
*23:48.040- 23:53.940* :  card and in fact when the manager accused me of playing the race card, I absolutely lost my temper.
*23:54.240- 24:00.280* :  That's the thing that was so offensive that they had no understanding or concept of what they
*24:00.280- 24:07.940* :  were actually saying was racist. I thought I was the victim but papers show that two soldiers
*24:07.940- 24:13.520* :  who were involved with me were actually treated as victims. They were reassured that
*24:13.740- 24:19.800* :  that action was being taken against me. I was treated as though I was a criminal.
*24:20.200- 24:25.660* :  Don't you think the army has made efforts to address this problem? Racism doesn't exist at the top.
*24:26.520- 24:31.880* :  If you're a black colonel, nobody's going to be calling you the N word. They're going to be
*24:31.880- 24:38.500* :  calling you sir because of the hierarchy but if you're a black private, guess what? You're going
*24:38.500- 24:46.180* :  to be hearing that every single day. Dwight Pyle Gray. An international animal welfare group says
*24:46.180- 24:51.560* :  at least a hundred elephants have died in Zimbabwe's biggest national park as waterholes there
*24:51.560- 24:57.380* :  have dried up. Philip Koverwoga with the International Fund for Animal Welfare told us more about
*24:57.380- 25:02.960* :  how the problem could continue in to next year. What we have experienced is a prolonged dry spell.
*25:02.960- 25:13.060* :  We expected to have received rains almost five weeks ago and because of the long dry spell
*25:13.180- 25:21.700* :  in these drought conditions, water shortages, food shortages, and extreme high temperatures
*25:21.700- 25:27.880* :  have really impacted the elephants and with the park authorities supporting that today,
*25:27.880- 25:36.640* :  we have lost a plus or minus hundred Jumbos. And with the anticipated El Nino phenomena in the
*25:36.640- 25:42.800* :  landscape in the region, we anticipate to receive less and less rainfall with high temperatures
*25:42.860- 25:50.440* :  for the most of the season up to March 2024. Philip Koverwoga from the International Fund for
*25:50.440- 25:56.800* :  Animal Welfare. Now, sleeper trains which are being reintroduced across Europe as part of a push
*25:56.800- 26:01.660* :  for greener, cheaper travel. Berlin and Paris will be first to get an overnight connection
*26:01.660- 26:08.240* :  and it's thought the prices will be cheaper than the day fare which is around $380 per person.
*26:08.300- 26:15.700* :  Lisa Louis went along for the ride. I'm at Berlin train station getting by day train from this
*26:15.700- 26:23.520* :  town in my home country to Paris in France where I live now is actually quite difficult. It takes
*26:23.520- 26:30.140* :  about eight and a half hours but now there is a night line which will take me back to Paris
*26:30.660- 26:35.280* :  seemingly in the blink of an eye if I manage to go to sleep. That is.
*26:39.280- 26:45.580* :  Taking a plane from Berlin to Paris would cost around 97 US dollars. On this train,
*26:45.580- 26:54.320* :  basic prices vary between 37 and 86 US dollars. But the environment is probably the biggest
*26:54.320- 27:03.080* :  winner from people taking trains. Plains produce about 28 times as much CO2 as trains on the same
*27:03.080- 27:07.760* :  journey according to Brussels-based NGO, Transport and Environment.
*27:10.220- 27:15.600* :  The National Railroad operators of Austria, Germany, France and Belgium are jointly running
*27:15.600- 27:23.000* :  this so-called night jet connection. Here is cordbower from Austria's UBB. We have around 30
*27:23.000- 27:28.920* :  different routes. We currently have 1.5 million passengers per year and we plan to have
*27:28.920- 27:34.400* :  3 million by end of this decade. On night trains, the courgette coach you're traveling in
*27:34.460- 27:40.840* :  has been built in the 70s and we really want to get rid of those coaches. It's not a quarter to
*27:40.840- 27:48.860* :  midnight. Oh my god, but I think there's a fire and that's make in the whole ways.
*27:49.400- 27:53.120* :  It's happening way to module and fortunately stuff like that. Really? What's your name?
*27:53.200- 27:56.600* :  Tibo, Constant. Because you're taking the night train quite often?
*27:56.840- 28:00.920* :  Yeah quite a lot. I'm a youtuber, specializing in train and fortunately the rolling
*28:00.920- 28:06.620* :  stock is just way too old. So it seems that they left something for too long in the microwave.
*28:07.580- 28:11.300* :  It's now half an hour later and we are rolling again.
*28:12.680- 28:16.000* :  I'm Clem Ambon, I'm a French minister for transportation so there were only two
*28:16.260- 28:21.700* :  two years ago. We will go up to 10 between now and the end of the decade and we do hope to add to
*28:22.420- 28:28.920* :  some extra European night train lines. Already we have put more than 150 million euro of
*28:28.920- 28:36.720* :  investment and we will add to that a few hundred millions. We are now arriving at Paris S train station
*28:37.820- 28:45.960* :  with a delay of only 15 minutes. Thank you for choosing night jets to make your journey.
*28:46.900- 28:54.360* :  Compared to the two hours a plane trip would take, this was 14 hours on a sleeper train and
*28:54.720- 28:59.900* :  it didn't involve much sleep for me. So I think I'm going to catch up on that now.
*29:00.860- 29:06.380* :  Lisa Louie, we already know that the often cuddly domestic cat is in fact a fearsome predator
*29:06.920- 29:11.060* :  wreaking havoc on local wildlife in any number of blameless suburban settings.
*29:11.100- 29:16.240* :  But new research has established that cats are actually driving some species towards extinction
*29:16.720- 29:17.640* :  as Terry Egan reports.
*29:22.800- 29:27.740* :  That's the singing of the Crested Lark but in the German town of Valdorf that singing
*29:27.740- 29:33.940* :  is in danger of being silenced by cats. As a consequence people there have been
*29:33.940- 29:41.060* :  ordered to keep their pet cats indoors during the spring. Crested Larks you see nest on the ground.
*29:41.060- 29:47.080* :  The order is just one result of what's been highlighted by a study done in the United States.
*29:47.800- 29:55.340* :  It suggests cats prey on up to 2,000 species and nearly a fifth of them are on conservation lists.
*29:56.140- 30:02.160* :  New Zealand is a good example where it's known cats have eaten species that are now extinct
*30:02.160- 30:06.720* :  such as the Steven's Island Rockren and the New Zealand quail.
*30:07.440- 30:13.940* :  Cats can be devastating on islands which are often home to endangered species that are vulnerable
*30:13.940- 30:20.660* :  when cats are introduced into previously cat-free environments. As for what to do about the problem
*30:21.080- 30:28.840* :  well tips include fitting bells and bright colours in order to warn prey and keeping cats inside.
*30:29.680- 30:35.700* :  Sterilising and microchipping are also recommended and while none of that sounds very cuddly
*30:36.220- 30:40.020* :  it could well help birds such as the Crested Lark.
*30:44.420- 30:46.580* :  Terry Egan posing for thought there.
*30:48.420- 30:51.920* :  And that's it from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
