*01:29.240- 01:35.060* :  I'm Gareth Barlow and at 13 hours GMT on Monday 11 December. These are our main stories.
*01:35.100- 01:40.080* :  The Supreme Court in India has ruled that the government's controversial decision to scrap
*01:40.080- 01:46.360* :  Kashmir's special status is valid. The United Nations Climate Body has published its latest draft
*01:46.360- 01:49.760* :  of a deal it hopes to conclude at the COP28 summit in Dubai.
*01:53.000- 01:57.980* :  Also in this podcast is rail is continuing an intense bombardment from the air and on the ground
*01:57.980- 02:04.280* :  of what it believes to be Hamas strongholds in Gaza. The UN appeals for $46 billion to find
*02:04.280- 02:10.100* :  its humanitarian work less than last year. And I don't know what comes from this when you're
*02:10.100- 02:16.520* :  willfully letting a man back onto the platform that's been fined $1.5 billion for suggesting
*02:16.520- 02:22.860* :  the death of innocent children was a conspiracy theory. Elon Musk allows the controversial right
*02:22.860- 02:27.100* :  wing talk show host Alex Jones back onto X in the name of free speech.
*02:30.720- 02:35.240* :  We start however in India where the Supreme Court has issued a ruling that will echo across
*02:35.240- 02:40.060* :  the peaks and valleys of one of the country's most troubled and beautiful regions, Kashmir.
*02:40.480- 02:44.320* :  The court has been asked to rule on the central government's controversial decision to
*02:44.320- 02:49.740* :  revoke Kashmir's special status, a status that had granted limited autonomy to the Muslim
*02:49.740- 02:54.520* :  majority region. Today the verdict was read out by one of the five judges who'd heard the case.
*02:55.080- 03:01.100* :  The state of Jammu and Kashmir does not retain any element of sovereignty after the execution
*03:01.100- 03:06.240* :  of the instrument of accession and the issuance of the proclamation dated 25 November,
*03:06.240- 03:13.160* :  29, by which the constitution of India was adopted. The state of Jammu and Kashmir does not have
*03:13.160- 03:18.380* :  internal sovereignty, which is distinguishable from the powers and privileges enjoyed by other
*03:18.380- 03:23.300* :  states in the country. But Adhan Azakani Kashmiri's social activist condemned the ruling.
*03:24.000- 03:29.400* :  The highest court of justice in India has set aside everything, has set aside the constitution,
*03:29.400- 03:35.440* :  democracy, rule of law, they have favored the majority organism, they have favored Modi and
*03:35.440- 03:40.620* :  MHR. Our South, Asia, regional, editor and barrison, etharanjan told me what the ruling is likely
*03:40.620- 03:47.640* :  to mean for the people of Kashmir. This goes back to 1947 when British India was divided into Hindu
*03:47.640- 03:53.740* :  majority India and the Muslim majority Pakistan at that time. Kashmir which was a Muslim majority
*03:53.740- 03:59.340* :  region ruled by a Hindu king wanted to be independent and because of tribesmen from Pakistan
*03:59.340- 04:06.640* :  attacking he decided to join the Indian Union. At that time the Indian leaders gave them the
*04:06.640- 04:14.780* :  special privileges like having their own constitution, flag and residency status for its people,
*04:15.420- 04:19.680* :  not allowing people from other parts of India to come and set up there to protect the
*04:19.680- 04:25.300* :  demography, culture and the religion there. Now this has been going on for nearly 75 years.
*04:26.360- 04:32.060* :  The government of India, current government in 2019 scrapped the special privilege saying that
*04:32.060- 04:37.960* :  it prevents more investments into the state. We wanted to integrate Kashmir with the rest of India
*04:38.540- 04:43.380* :  and that is why we are scrapping these semi-autonomous status. Now that was challenged by many
*04:43.380- 04:49.040* :  Kashmiri political groups saying that it was unconstitutional illegal because the people of Indian
*04:49.040- 04:54.700* :  administered Kashmir. They were not consulted and so it should not be allowed to happen but now
*04:54.700- 04:59.900* :  the court has very categorically given the judgment which was a unanimous judgment saying that
*05:00.600- 05:06.920* :  the government's decision to revoke the special status is valid but it asked the government to
*05:06.920- 05:13.240* :  hold elections by September 2024. As you know Indian administered Kashmir is a disputed region. Pakistan
*05:13.860- 05:20.160* :  also claims the entire region. Pakistan has rejected this Supreme Court's decision saying that
*05:20.160- 05:26.640* :  we will not accept this because this is still a disputed region. We heard from an activist a moment
*05:26.640- 05:31.820* :  ago responding angrily to the ruling. What is the political reaction being maybe not just within
*05:31.820- 05:37.100* :  Kashmir but more broadly as well? A most political parties in India they have welcomed this ruling
*05:37.100- 05:42.260* :  by Supreme Court. They have described this as long overdue because this special privilege to
*05:42.260- 05:49.120* :  only one state was a major bone of contention between various political parties and the Kashmiri
*05:49.120- 05:54.320* :  political groups. So the Indian political parties, the mainstream political parties have welcomed
*05:54.320- 05:59.940* :  however. If you talk to the Kashmiri political leaders they say that they were disappointed by the
*05:59.940- 06:06.140* :  order because they were not discussed when this major decision was taken but they will continue their
*06:06.140- 06:12.260* :  fight for justice for the respect of the Kashmiri people. Elections are due to be held in India
*06:12.260- 06:18.420* :  next year. How do you think this will affect Narendra Modi and kind of the electoral challenge
*06:18.420- 06:23.440* :  more broadly? This was one of the election promises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party,
*06:23.440- 06:30.200* :  the Hindu nationalist BJP before the election and for a long time many Hindu groups have been
*06:30.200- 06:36.140* :  demanding this special status should be revoked saying that the whole country should be one part.
*06:36.140- 06:41.580* :  So this will be seen as a big boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a head of general elections
*06:41.580- 06:48.720* :  due by May. He can go to the people and then say that we promised to abolish this special status
*06:48.720- 06:56.220* :  and now we have done that. To the Middle East now and Israeli troops are continuing their operations
*06:56.220- 07:02.240* :  in Gaza's southern city of Karni Unis after the Hamas spokesperson Abu Abbaida warned that none of
*07:02.240- 07:07.880* :  the remaining hostages would leave Gaza alive unless its demands were met. Israel's Prime Minister
*07:07.880- 07:12.900* :  Benjamin Netanyahu called on more Hamas fighters to surrender, claiming that dozens had already
*07:12.900- 07:18.040* :  done so for Hamas denies those claims. Our Middle East correspondent Yehla Nell told us more.
*07:18.660- 07:24.020* :  It's been very heavy fighting again in Karni Unis. It's a stronghold of Hamas the main focus
*07:24.020- 07:29.060* :  of Israel's southern offensive and the tanks Israeli forces are right in the heart of the city.
*07:29.460- 07:33.440* :  People were told to flee from the center of Karni Unis yesterday but they really say it's too
*07:33.440- 07:38.560* :  dangerous for them to flee towards Raffa in the very south of the strip now because you have
*07:38.900- 07:44.960* :  tanks to reach the city's main north to south road and also heavy bombardment of the west of
*07:44.960- 07:50.740* :  the city and that is leading to really grim stories from the hospital there. The Nasser hospital
*07:50.740- 07:56.060* :  we're hearing from one medic about how it's a catastrophic situation. He said the hospitals
*07:56.060- 08:01.680* :  crowded with the wounded, with displaced people everywhere. Medical teams exhausted working
*08:01.680- 08:06.680* :  around the clock and tanks and Israeli snipers are positioned not far away from the hospital.
*08:07.240- 08:12.980* :  Just looking at life pictures showing pillars of smoke rising up into the sky above the
*08:12.980- 08:18.580* :  Gaza strip and we've been hearing that Hamas wants Palestinian prisoners to be freed in return
*08:18.580- 08:22.860* :  for Israeli hostages. How are those negotiations going? Are those negotiations ongoing?
*08:23.260- 08:29.360* :  Well, Qatar, which mediated the week-long truce that we saw last month, says it's continuing its
*08:29.360- 08:35.540* :  efforts to have a ceasefire to free those 117 hostages that Israel believes Hamas is still holding
*08:35.540- 08:41.260* :  along with the remains of some people as well in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
*08:41.260- 08:46.680* :  jails. We had that threat from the Hamas spokesman. The not a single hostage would leave a
*08:46.680- 08:51.300* :  live if its demands were not met. But the Qataris are really saying that what's happening at the
*08:51.300- 08:55.760* :  moment is with the intense Israeli bombardment. That is what is narrowing the window of success
*08:55.760- 09:02.360* :  in their words to try to get a new deal. Israeli leaders have been coming out defiantly over
*09:02.360- 09:07.760* :  the past couple of days, basically saying that they are intensifying the war that they can't end
*09:07.760- 09:14.440* :  it now before crushing Hamas. That's its main aim. The BBC's Yolan Nell. The United Nations
*09:14.440- 09:19.240* :  climate body has published its latest draft of a deal it hopes to conclude at the
*09:19.240- 09:24.900* :  COP28 summit in Dubai. It includes a range of actions countries could take to reduce emissions,
*09:24.900- 09:30.720* :  but makes no direct reference to phasing out fossil fuels as demanded by the UN Secretary-General
*09:30.720- 09:35.940* :  Antoni Gaterish earlier on Monday. Mr. Gaterish had said it was time to go into overdrive to reach
*09:35.940- 09:42.880* :  a consensus. COP28 is scheduled to wrap up tomorrow, but there are still large gaps that need
*09:42.880- 09:49.780* :  to be bridged. Now is the time for maximum ambition and maximum flexibility.
*09:51.400- 09:58.520* :  Ministers and negotiators must move beyond arbitrary red lines in trench positions and blocking
*09:58.520- 10:06.100* :  tactics. It's time to go into overdrive to negotiate in good face and rise to the challenge
*10:06.100- 10:13.460* :  set by COP President Dr Sultana Ahmed Al-Jaber. The talks in Dubai have highlighted deep
*10:13.460- 10:18.920* :  international divisions over the future role of oil, gas and coal as negotiators work to reach
*10:18.920- 10:24.080* :  an agreement. Major oil producers at the talks like Saudi Arabia have rejected proposals to
*10:24.080- 10:29.400* :  phase out fossil fuels. Here's on climate editor Justin Rollert who got hold of the draft proposals
*10:29.880- 10:35.600* :  shortly before we recorded the podcast. We've got what we think is the text for the latest round
*10:35.600- 10:40.260* :  of negotiations, I mean to be honest. It looks like a final text because what's really interesting
*10:40.260- 10:46.520* :  is this doesn't have any options around the one of the headline aspects of this, which is the future
*10:46.520- 10:50.700* :  of fossil fuels. Just to clarify, often when we get these texts you'll see brackets in the margin,
*10:50.700- 10:57.880* :  you'll see options. The previous one had five options including a no-text. This one doesn't appear.
*10:57.880- 11:03.800* :  I'm slightly reluctant to commit myself, but I think I've read for it quickly. What it contains
*11:04.060- 11:10.960* :  is a much more detailed outline of the direction of travel for fossil fuels. It talks about reducing
*11:10.960- 11:16.600* :  both consumption and production of fuels. The need to triple renewable energy consumption, double
*11:16.600- 11:22.720* :  energy efficiency. It talks about the need to phase down unabated coal when you're not capturing
*11:22.720- 11:28.640* :  the carbon emissions. There's all sorts of really quite strong and detailed language in here
*11:28.640- 11:34.940* :  and crucially we are not seeing any options. It looks like they think that this is a text that the
*11:34.940- 11:40.160* :  parties here, the countries here, can vote on. We should remember they have never in the past
*11:40.160- 11:44.720* :  recognised the need to deal with the central issue at the heart of climate change, which of course
*11:44.720- 11:49.220* :  is fossil fuels which create the emissions that are warming the atmosphere. The parties, the
*11:49.220- 11:54.800* :  countries will go off and read this and they'll decide whether it meets the issues that they've
*11:54.800- 11:58.900* :  got or every country approaches this issue differently. They've all expressed what they want to
*11:58.900- 12:03.320* :  see in the text. They'll look at this and decide whether this is a compromise because what's been
*12:03.320- 12:08.180* :  happening, they've been listening, drawing in and trying to find as ambitious as possible a
*12:08.180- 12:14.160* :  compromise document. This is a very detailed and looks as if they've listened to a lot of people,
*12:14.160- 12:18.620* :  but this really does look quite ambitious. I mean for people who care about climate change,
*12:18.620- 12:23.040* :  this is a very encouraging document. They go away at about nine o'clock tonight. We understand
*12:23.040- 12:28.280* :  there might be opening the plenary, which is the open forum in which the countries can express
*12:28.280- 12:32.900* :  their views and there's a chance then. They might vote on this and we might get a deal which would
*12:32.900- 12:38.420* :  represent the first time the world has said we're going to phase down fossil fuels. Justin Rola,
*12:38.420- 12:45.180* :  they're speaking to the BBC's Cardnasmun. The United Nations is appealing for $46 billion to fund
*12:45.200- 12:50.640* :  its humanitarian operations next year. It hopes to help nearly 300 million people affected by
*12:50.640- 12:55.000* :  humanitarian crises across the world with Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine all at the forefront.
*12:55.600- 12:59.680* :  But as Imogen folks explains, the UN is scaling back its work after getting nowhere near what it
*12:59.680- 13:06.340* :  asked for a year ago. If you want to look at this year's budget taking up to the end of this year,
*13:06.340- 13:14.700* :  what the UN asked for this time last year was almost $57 billion. Almost the end of the year they've
*13:14.700- 13:21.140* :  got $20 billion, which is just around a third. When you look at the crisis, even the ones that
*13:21.140- 13:28.280* :  have also erupted this year, like the conflict in Sudan, Ukraine war still ongoing, drought
*13:28.280- 13:36.000* :  ongoing in parts of Africa, it's a very challenging world out there. But this year, interestingly,
*13:36.060- 13:42.300* :  the UN has come up with a lower figure, and that's because it's recognised that if it asks for
*13:42.920- 13:48.420* :  what sums that turn out to be unrealistic, it will make plans that are unrealistic. So this year
*13:48.420- 13:58.120* :  it's asking for $46 billion and targeting $180 million of the 300 million it assesses as in need,
*13:58.560- 14:04.560* :  which is going to be very hard for some people in our world. We know that food distribution for
*14:04.560- 14:09.800* :  some of the poorest and most vulnerable in Syria and Yemen has already had to be cut.
*14:10.580- 14:13.640* :  And I think we may seem more of that in the year to go, and perhaps
*14:14.600- 14:21.760* :  less ability to react quickly to the unexpected violent crisis that we saw in Sudan and are now
*14:21.760- 14:27.500* :  seeing in Gaza, for example. That was image and folks. The tech billionaire, Elon Musk, describes
*14:27.500- 14:32.580* :  himself as an advocate of free speech, the owner of X, formerly Twitter, of course, says the social
*14:32.580- 14:37.760* :  media platform is a place where controversial voices can be heard. Now, the right-wing American
*14:37.760- 14:43.020* :  conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has had his account on X, restored by Musk, who had asked
*14:43.020- 14:48.000* :  users to vote on whether to lift the ban that was put in place five years ago. Paddy Maguire reports.
*14:48.920- 14:54.440* :  The people have spoken, and so it shall be, posted Musk. Seventy percent of the nearly two
*14:54.440- 15:00.160* :  million people who took part in the poll said yes. And just like that, Alex Jones, the right-wing
*15:00.160- 15:06.500* :  conspiracy theorist is back on X, along with his million-plus followers. He's the founder of the
*15:06.500- 15:12.440* :  website Info Wars and was banned in 2018 by what was then Twitter for breaching their rules on
*15:12.440- 15:18.500* :  abusive behavior. He remains barred from YouTube and Facebook. Among other things, Jones has
*15:18.500- 15:24.380* :  traded on a series of false claims about the 2012 shooting at the Sandy Hook School in Connecticut
*15:24.380- 15:30.480* :  in which 20 children and six adults were killed. He said it was a hoax that no one died.
*15:30.480- 15:38.820* :  Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake, with actors, in my view, manufacturer. I couldn't
*15:38.820- 15:43.780* :  believe it at first. He was also sued by the families of victims of the shooting in order to pay
*15:43.780- 15:49.560* :  more than a billion dollars in damages. Elon Musk had himself promised never to let Jones back on
*15:49.560- 15:55.220* :  the platform, but this is what he had to say to the BBC last year. Free speech is meaningless,
*15:55.560- 16:01.820* :  unless you allow people you don't like to say things you don't like. Otherwise, it's relevant.
*16:02.800- 16:06.520* :  And if at the point of which you lose a free speech, it doesn't come back.
*16:07.300- 16:12.540* :  But some are asking at what cost? The families of the victims of Sandy Hook faced endless
*16:12.540- 16:17.820* :  harassment from Jones' followers, some of whom claimed their murdered children never existed.
*16:17.820- 16:23.800* :  Not everyone's happy about Jones' reinstatement on X. His technology journalist will get it.
*16:23.960- 16:28.600* :  I don't know what comes from this when you're willfully letting a man back onto the platform
*16:28.600- 16:34.280* :  that's been fined $1.5 billion for suggesting the death of innocent children
*16:34.280- 16:40.720* :  was a conspiracy theory and actors and actresses were employed. This isn't about freedom of speech.
*16:40.720- 16:45.800* :  This is somebody who is willfully lied and has been found out by a court to be a liar
*16:46.240- 16:50.820* :  and has been forced to pay damages and decided to go bankrupt because they didn't want to pay.
*16:50.820- 16:56.500* :  What financial impact could this have on X? Last month, Musk warned that the company might go under
*16:56.500- 17:01.600* :  because of an advertising boycott. A number of high-profile companies, including Disney,
*17:01.600- 17:05.380* :  have stopped posting on the platform after Musk shared a tweet,
*17:05.380- 17:11.540* :  considered by some to be anti-Semitic. He apologized, but in an expletive laden outburst
*17:11.540- 17:15.320* :  at a later event in New York, accused the companies of blackmail.
*17:15.700- 17:20.000* :  Alex Jones is the latest in a number of controversial figures who have been reinstated.
*17:20.520- 17:26.120* :  Donald Trump, Kanye West and Andrew Tate, the former kickboxer facing rape and human
*17:26.120- 17:30.380* :  trafficking charges in Romania. Jones's first post was a retweet of Tate,
*17:30.780- 17:34.780* :  who's hailed Jones' triumphant return. Paddy McGuire reporting.
*17:39.520- 17:44.380* :  Still to calm on the global news podcast? How many of you are hearing me at a town hall for the
*17:44.380- 17:49.500* :  first time? Well, where have y'all been? We're on the campaign trail with Nikki Haley,
*17:49.500- 17:53.740* :  one of the candidates challenging Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.
*17:57.400- 18:02.140* :  Let's turn our attention now, though, to Polish politics, because it's a big day. Two months after
*18:02.140- 18:06.820* :  the general election, which attracted a very high turnout, the country is still without a government,
*18:06.820- 18:11.600* :  but that could be about to change. Members of parliament will vote later on a government presented
*18:11.600- 18:15.980* :  by the Prime Minister Mateusz Moroviecki. Adressing parliament, he called on members to
*18:15.980- 18:27.400* :  overcome internal disagreements. We must end the Polish-Polish war. I call on all of us to do this,
*18:27.620- 18:33.780* :  both myself and you. MPs, let's end this war. Let's choose dialogue. Let's look for what
*18:33.780- 18:39.560* :  unites us. Only by rejecting such an extreme conflict can we pave the way for new development.
*18:39.560- 18:44.980* :  If he loses today's vote, it will be the turn of the former Prime Minister Donald Tusk to form
*18:44.980- 18:50.100* :  a government instead. He's reflected his sense of anticipation by posting ready-steady go
*18:50.100- 18:54.740* :  on social media this morning. The BBC's Rebecca Kezby spoke to Dominik Taczynski,
*18:54.740- 19:00.420* :  who is an MP for the Rooting Law and Justice Party, so that any chance his party can win today's
*19:00.420- 19:06.540* :  confidence vote. There is a slight chance. Obviously, most of these small parties already told
*19:06.540- 19:10.660* :  us, our Prime Minister, that they're not going to vote for us. They're not going to support
*19:10.660- 19:16.640* :  our government, so probably, Donald Tusk will take over tomorrow. But I'm not 100% sure
*19:16.640- 19:23.220* :  our Prime Minister's exposé was just brilliant. Our achievements are so great, like the lowest
*19:23.220- 19:28.620* :  unemployment in European Union. The biggest land arming in European Union, the highest
*19:28.620- 19:35.180* :  GBT growth after COVID in European Union. So there is many things important for Poland, and we don't
*19:35.180- 19:40.660* :  know how MPs will vote, but we have to wait. Well, I mean, you talk about your achievements,
*19:40.660- 19:46.400* :  but the truth is, your policies have been roundly rejected by the electorate, haven't they,
*19:46.400- 19:52.160* :  because you didn't get the majority you need to rule the country. Is it time for your party to
*19:52.160- 19:57.980* :  change its policies? No, not at all. You have to remember that our party won election,
*19:57.980- 20:08.020* :  this is my party, again, a 7,600,000 votes when Donald Tusk party gained 6,500,000 votes. So we
*20:08.020- 20:14.540* :  have one, but Donald Tusk, he asked for a support for smaller parties to be exact 11 small parties
*20:14.540- 20:20.440* :  to support him. Okay, you are going to be the largest party in parliament. What kind of opposition
*20:20.500- 20:25.600* :  are you going to be then? An effective one, or are you just going to be a thorn in the side of
*20:25.600- 20:30.260* :  Donald Tusk? We're going to be very much focused on our independence, very important things taking
*20:30.260- 20:36.520* :  place in European Union now, changing the treaties, and basically there is a threat of losing our
*20:36.520- 20:43.100* :  sovereignty. So we're going to try to stop Donald Tusk, who is in favor of a centralization as
*20:43.100- 20:49.680* :  they call it, of European Union, which means to be honest, taking our veto, taking our borders,
*20:50.220- 20:57.160* :  to Brussels. On that, your Prime Minister posted on social media earlier, Poland is our common
*20:57.160- 21:03.320* :  home. Today, it needs unity of all political forces, I believe it's possible. What do you think
*21:03.320- 21:10.020* :  he meant by that? He meant that the main goal for every single independent syren country is
*21:10.020- 21:14.920* :  sovereignty. We can be divided, we can have different views on many political issues,
*21:14.920- 21:22.360* :  but when it comes to sovereignty and freedom, Poland should be fighting together against tyranny.
*21:22.520- 21:26.900* :  You don't think he was just trying to sound a bit more friendly towards Donald Tusk, who,
*21:26.900- 21:31.760* :  as you say, will probably be the Prime Minister by this time tomorrow, because Donald Tusk has
*21:31.760- 21:37.540* :  been threatening politicians from your party with potential legal action over decisions made
*21:37.540- 21:43.980* :  particularly during the COVID years and alleged, well, corruption. We will never be friends to
*21:43.980- 21:49.780* :  Donald Tusk. There are so many differences that we never, ever be friends. He was always like a
*21:50.100- 21:56.540* :  little dictator even in his own party when he was fighting against his own members, so I'm not
*21:56.540- 22:03.000* :  surprised that he's looking for undemocratic tools to fight opponents. Dominic Tajinsky,
*22:04.040- 22:09.940* :  an outspoken doctor who exposed the AIDS epidemic spreading in rural China has died after living in
*22:09.940- 22:16.140* :  exile in the United States. Gaoyou Jiu was a gynecologist working in China's central Henan province
*22:16.160- 22:21.240* :  when she discovered that thousands became ill due to infected blood donations. With more,
*22:21.240- 22:27.860* :  here's our Asia-Pacific editor, Celia Horton. In the 1990s, Dr Gaoyou Jiu worked as a women's
*22:27.860- 22:34.420* :  health doctor, going from village to village in central China, primarily in her home province of
*22:34.420- 22:41.680* :  Henan. She discovered a hidden crisis. Many were getting sick with HIV and AIDS after either
*22:41.680- 22:47.660* :  donating blood or receiving blood transplants. Farmers had been making extra money selling their
*22:47.660- 22:53.900* :  blood in hospitals, but the blood wasn't screened for HIV and dirty needles were reused,
*22:53.900- 23:00.480* :  infecting the donors. Dr Gaoyou's repeated calls for help from the outside world led the crisis
*23:00.480- 23:05.320* :  to be addressed, but the Chinese authorities had been embarrassed by her whistle-blowing efforts.
*23:05.500- 23:12.220* :  Facing political pressure, she continued to speak out on the threat of HIV after going into exile
*23:12.220- 23:19.440* :  in the U.S. She died age 95. Celia Horton. Since the start of the Ukraine war, the United
*23:19.440- 23:23.980* :  States has been Kyiv's strongest support to supplying billions of dollars of military aid to the
*23:23.980- 23:28.940* :  government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Now with Kyiv appealing for more military support,
*23:28.940- 23:33.080* :  President Biden has invited Mr. Zelensky to Washington to discuss the matter.
*23:33.660- 23:38.700* :  Ukraine in president says his country risks losing the war against Russia if new funding is not
*23:38.700- 23:43.600* :  made available immediately. Our North America correspondent, Shinkanyaka, says Mr. Zelensky
*23:43.600- 23:50.280* :  is facing an uphill battle. What I've been told by some members of staff of the White House is that
*23:50.280- 23:57.380* :  they are really trying to push, push, push to ensure that this voters approved in Congress and
*23:57.380- 24:02.800* :  both the lower house and the upper house. But enormous obstacles stand in the way,
*24:03.160- 24:09.620* :  according to Mr. Biden. The Republican lawmakers want to attach certain conditions. They want
*24:09.620- 24:15.660* :  greater border security in the U.S. before they can agree to any kind of package for Ukraine.
*24:16.140- 24:19.680* :  And so it's an uphill battle that Mr. Zelensky faces.
*24:20.360- 24:27.700* :  How could Ukraine cope without U.S. aid? Could it cope? And can Mr. Biden bypass Congress?
*24:28.620- 24:35.860* :  Well, the U.S. so far we understand has spent about 110 billion U.S. dollars mainly in military
*24:35.860- 24:43.520* :  support for Ukraine. So not a lot for humanitarian aid and financial aid. This particular partnership has
*24:43.520- 24:49.020* :  been one of the most important for Ukraine. The largest military support that it has received is
*24:49.020- 24:55.260* :  from the U.S. and the delegation that came here last week made the point that if they don't secure
*24:55.260- 25:01.440* :  more aid from the U.S. that they will likely lose ground to Russia. They've also said that there's
*25:01.440- 25:08.680* :  a likelihood that Ukraine might lose the war. And in that case that President Putin might move into
*25:08.680- 25:15.400* :  NATO countries. And so the huge implications there is a lot of pressure on both President Zelensky
*25:15.740- 25:22.440* :  and President Biden to try to make sure that they find a strategy to convince the Republicans
*25:22.440- 25:29.940* :  in Congress to approve this deal. There's talk that Mr. Zelensky may make a direct appeal to Congress.
*25:29.940- 25:32.160* :  Have you heard much about that? And would it change anything?
*25:32.520- 25:37.220* :  There have been reports that he is likely to meet with the members of Congress. It's not
*25:37.360- 25:41.160* :  clear with it that will be an address or whether he'll meet with them individually.
*25:41.160- 25:46.700* :  But I'm sure he will be eager to address them. There's been a sharp drop in both the
*25:46.700- 25:52.400* :  public and political support among Americans for the Ukraine war. And so he'll want to try to
*25:52.400- 25:56.900* :  convince them that this really is in the U.S. as national interests to support this war.
*25:57.180- 26:00.800* :  Shinghai Nyokha in Washington. Let's stick with the U.S. because candidates
*26:00.800- 26:05.740* :  vying for the Republican nomination in the United States are focusing their efforts on Iowa.
*26:06.220- 26:10.400* :  They're just five weeks left until Republican voters in the state decide on who they want to be
*26:10.400- 26:14.900* :  their presidential candidate. Right now the former president Donald Trump is well ahead,
*26:14.900- 26:19.560* :  but support for Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, is rising steadily.
*26:19.560- 26:25.440* :  Sarah Smith is on the campaign trail in Iowa. How many of you are hearing me at a town hall
*26:25.440- 26:30.440* :  for the first time? Well, where have y'all been? It's good to see you.
*26:30.440- 26:33.500* :  At her numerous campaign stops across the state of Iowa,
*26:33.920- 26:38.960* :  Nikki Haley's team are selling campaign t-shirts that say, underestimate me. That will be fun.
*26:40.260- 26:44.860* :  And she tells supporters that she has been so often underestimated it's become her superpower.
*26:46.200- 26:50.860* :  At events like this town hall meeting in Clear Lake, Iowa, she promises tax cuts,
*26:51.400- 26:56.260* :  beefed up border security and smaller government if she becomes the first female president.
*27:01.720- 27:05.340* :  Four televised Republican debates brought her to national attention.
*27:05.340- 27:10.200* :  The only person more fascist than the Biden regime now is Nikki Haley, who thinks the government
*27:10.200- 27:13.780* :  should put her place in profile. And I makes her a target for all the other candidates.
*27:14.040- 27:16.980* :  Happy to, and I love all the attention, fellas. Thank you for that.
*27:17.260- 27:23.400* :  Her campaign has been boosted by big influential donors who are giving millions to try and cement her
*27:23.400- 27:29.400* :  as the sole anti-Trump candidate. So there's chaos all around us, but what I know is you don't
*27:29.400- 27:34.980* :  defeat Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. And that's what Donald Trump gives us.
*27:35.660- 27:39.740* :  Voters who'd come to listen to her speak at Dort University in Sue Center, Iowa,
*27:40.240- 27:44.660* :  seem to like what they'd heard. Nikki, she's much more composed and calm and everything she says,
*27:44.660- 27:47.420* :  which is it establishes a lot of confidence in her as well.
*27:47.560- 27:52.200* :  I think she does a good job of walking the middle ground too, of not being so party versus party.
*27:52.640- 27:57.240* :  You've supported Trump in previous elections, and now you're backing Nikki Haley, why?
*27:58.360- 28:04.360* :  You know, I see her bringing people together. And with Donald Trump, there's a lot of divisiveness,
*28:04.360- 28:09.820* :  and I don't think our country needs that right now. But she struggles to win over Trump supporters.
*28:10.160- 28:15.560* :  I see Nikki Haley as too much of already the establishment. I don't agree with her views on
*28:15.560- 28:21.500* :  Ukraine or the world environment at all. Nikki Haley did work for Donald Trump when he was president.
*28:21.500- 28:28.080* :  Haley Ambassador to the United Nations has been very special to me. She's done an incredible job.
*28:28.820- 28:32.920* :  She says he was the right president at the right time, but that the country now needs more
*28:32.920- 28:37.520* :  sober leadership. And she quotes recent polls that suggest she is more likely than Donald Trump
*28:37.520- 28:45.360* :  to win. In every one of those polls, I defeat Biden by 10 to 13 points.
*28:51.060- 28:55.900* :  Nikki Haley is selling pretty traditional conservatism. It could have one of the
*28:55.900- 29:01.980* :  nomination a few years ago, but don't forget, the Republican Party has been transformed by Donald
*29:02.060- 29:06.320* :  Trump. Many of them now reject this kind of establishment politics.
*29:11.880- 29:15.520* :  Most of the people who come to these campaign events and many more right across the U.S.
*29:15.520- 29:20.440* :  are looking for a Trump alternative. But even if they all coalesce around Miss Haley,
*29:20.800- 29:23.280* :  she still seems likely to lose to the former president.
*29:24.040- 29:26.500* :  polls have missed a Trump 40 points ahead of her.
*29:28.140- 29:33.160* :  Nikki Haley is currently doing very well, but in what may just be a battle for second place.
*29:34.360- 29:35.420* :  Sarah Smith reporting.
*29:36.340- 29:40.240* :  Now, at this time of year in the UK, we have a tradition of musical theatre performances
*29:40.240- 29:44.740* :  called pantomime. It's based on the Italian theatre of commedia dell'arte.
*29:44.740- 29:50.380* :  The shows often feature bangs, crashes and general raucousness, which can be a family favourite,
*29:50.380- 29:55.180* :  but for people with additional needs, the seasonal theatrical experience could be somewhat overwhelming.
*29:55.180- 29:59.240* :  That's why more and more venues are offering relaxed versions of their traditional
*29:59.240- 30:03.140* :  shows with the flashes bangs and noisy songs all just toned down.
*30:03.560- 30:06.900* :  Richard Forbes, once with theatre in Edinburgh in Scotland, which has led the way.
*30:08.560- 30:14.240* :  Taking their seats for a special performance, more than 600 people's with additional
*30:14.240- 30:17.760* :  support needs fill the auditorium at Edinburgh's festival theatre.
*30:36.300- 30:41.500* :  With the music and lights toned down, everyone can enjoy the spectacle without being overwhelmed.
*30:42.460- 30:43.360* :  What did you think of it?
*30:43.700- 30:47.900* :  It was amazing. I liked the crocodile, and it was amazing.
*30:47.900- 30:54.140* :  I think, then, one more way, he stood on that swift cancun girl.
*30:55.900- 30:58.460* :  The children react sometimes in quite a boisterous way.
*30:58.460- 31:03.060* :  It's great they can get the opportunity to do that, but if you come to an ordinary performance,
*31:03.060- 31:05.960* :  it can be diffusually difficult to do that.
*31:11.180- 31:15.540* :  The start of the show took part in the very first relaxed panel back in 2012.
*31:16.360- 31:21.640* :  It was a sort of comment on Facebook from a parent who said she just loved coming to their
*31:21.640- 31:26.400* :  relaxed performance because for the very first time, she was able to take her child to the theatre
*31:27.000- 31:31.020* :  or a cinema experience without worrying what other people were going to think.
*31:31.240- 31:34.640* :  And I thought that that just underlined exactly how important it was, not just for the child to be
*31:34.640- 31:38.780* :  able to come to the theatre, but for the parent or the care to come with her.
*31:38.920- 31:40.280* :  It's very special.
*31:40.640- 31:43.140* :  And after this performance, these kids are hooked.
*31:44.020- 31:45.680* :  That report there by Richard Forbes.
*31:48.900- 31:52.840* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.

*32:24.600- 32:26.500* :  you almost start believing something's not right.

*32:46.800- 32:50.680* :  and give you a fresh global perspective on the stories that matter.

*33:17.300- 33:19.600* :  They have holiday decor at Nordstrom.
