*01:42.540- 01:45.840* :  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:48.760- 01:51.220* :  I'm Jon Atelier, and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:51.220- 01:53.880* :  the 19th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:54.600- 01:59.300* :  Hamas releases a video of three elderly male hostages being held in Gaza,
*01:59.620- 02:01.240* :  and moved denounced by Israel.
*02:02.140- 02:06.720* :  More companies have suspended shipping through the Red Sea because of attacks launched from Yemen.
*02:07.540- 02:12.980* :  The paramilitary rapid support forces in Sudan have reportedly seized control of a city
*02:12.980- 02:16.180* :  that's been sheltering hundreds of thousands of displaced people.
*02:19.780- 02:26.300* :  Also in this podcast, my sentence improved immensely, and it was just great, great feeling,
*02:26.300- 02:30.120* :  not just for me, but for the future for us women who suffered with it.
*02:30.720- 02:35.140* :  A revolutionary new treatment to reduce the misery of menopause.
*02:39.500- 02:44.840* :  Hamas has released a video of three elderly men being held hostage in Gaza.
*02:45.420- 02:48.260* :  Two of them are in their 80s and one is 79.
*02:49.120- 02:54.700* :  One of them speaks to the camera about how they're suffering greatly in very harsh conditions.
*02:55.600- 03:00.080* :  He calls for their release saying we don't want to be casualties of an airstrike.
*03:00.740- 03:05.480* :  Israel has previously condemned such videos as psychological warfare.
*03:06.060- 03:11.240* :  Daniel Hagarri, a spokesman for the Israeli Army, was quick to denounce this latest one.
*03:14.900- 03:19.840* :  The video that Hamas released in the past hours is a criminal terror video.
*03:20.600- 03:27.900* :  It testifies to Hamas's cruelty towards innocent, very elderly civilians, who I need of medical care.
*03:28.980- 03:33.980* :  Time, Yoram and Amiram, I hope you can hear me this evening.
*03:34.920- 03:40.020* :  Know that we are doing everything, everything we can to bring you back safely.
*03:41.060- 03:46.640* :  Some of your families are already home, and we will not rest until you return as well.
*03:47.780- 03:52.980* :  The video was released shortly after the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met Israeli leaders
*03:52.980- 03:58.880* :  on his second visit to Israel since Hamas's deadly attacks on October 7th.
*03:59.140- 04:04.420* :  At a news conference in Tel Aviv with his Israeli counterpart, he said America's support for
*04:04.480- 04:10.960* :  Israel remained unshakable, but also called on it to do more to avoid civilian deaths in Gaza.
*04:11.680- 04:17.960* :  Protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral duty and a strategic imperative.
*04:19.640- 04:23.960* :  So we will continue to stand up for Israel's bedrock right to defend itself.
*04:25.280- 04:29.240* :  And we will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict
*04:30.280- 04:33.480* :  and to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
*04:35.120- 04:40.980* :  That's important as Israel fights to dismantle the Hamas terrorist infrastructure in Gaza.
*04:41.520- 04:47.000* :  And it will also be crucial for our work with our allies and partners after the fighting stops.
*04:47.760- 04:51.420* :  More than 100 hostages are being held in Gaza.
*04:51.420- 04:57.620* :  The Hamas run health ministry in Gaza says more than 19,000 people have now been killed by
*04:57.620- 05:04.460* :  Israel's military. It says 40% of the victims are children. One of the latest to die was a 13-year-old
*05:04.460- 05:09.840* :  girl, Dina Abu Mosin, who was being treated in hospital after having her leg amputated.
*05:10.600- 05:15.180* :  She'd recorded a video pleading for help after losing her parents and her siblings in an
*05:15.180- 05:19.080* :  earlier Israeli strike. The Israeli Defense Minister, U.F. Galant,
*05:19.540- 05:24.620* :  said the U.S. knew his country was going to great lengths to avoid hitting civilians.
*05:25.680- 05:32.860* :  We both know the complexities of war. We both fought brutal terrorist organization.
*05:32.860- 05:42.200* :  And we know that it takes time. Unlike our enemies, we are defending our values and we operate
*05:42.820- 05:52.200* :  according to international law. The IDF is operating to minimize the harm to civilian population.
*05:52.820- 05:57.980* :  This is disputed by groups like Human Rights Watch. It's accused Israel of using starvation
*05:57.980- 06:04.520* :  of civilians as a weapon in its war against Hamas. The group said by blocking deliveries of
*06:04.520- 06:11.060* :  food, water and fuel, Israel's actions could constitute a war crime. These Palestinians
*06:11.660- 06:13.460* :  described what life had become like in Gaza.
*06:16.520- 06:21.300* :  I've been displaced to my Garzi camp. I've been displaced more than once, but this time we settled
*06:21.300- 06:26.520* :  at Camp Garzi. I'm talking to you right now as there's constant bombardment. I want to state
*06:26.520- 06:31.280* :  something. The aid that arrives is not enough because we have a large number of children
*06:31.280- 06:36.180* :  and we are citizens of Gaza at largely depend on this aid, which is an essential
*06:36.620- 06:40.260* :  to live from our neighboring countries, either Egypt or any neighboring country.
*06:44.100- 06:49.880* :  My name is Ode living in the District of Gaza and there is an ongoing war on Gaza.
*06:50.360- 06:55.540* :  I got to the supermarket and I can't find anything. I can't find biscuits. I can't find chips.
*06:55.540- 07:01.260* :  I can't find anything and I want chips and biscuits. Mr Austin's visit comes days after
*07:01.260- 07:06.980* :  President Biden warned that Israel risked losing the international support that it had won after
*07:06.980- 07:12.940* :  the October 7th attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 people. Our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*07:12.940- 07:17.660* :  Frank Gardner, said the US Defense Secretary was trying to strike a delicate balance.
*07:18.480- 07:24.000* :  Well, I think he was probably under instructions to kind of be quite placatory, at least in public,
*07:24.000- 07:29.340* :  with Israel. Certainly, they went to some lengths to show a kind of a united stand. He was very
*07:29.340- 07:34.940* :  clear that America's support for Israel was rock solid and he had no greater friend, etc.
*07:34.940- 07:41.040* :  and that Israel would not be alone. He did say democracies are stronger when they stick to
*07:41.040- 07:47.500* :  the rule of law or words that affect. It's no secret that the US wants Israel to move to a
*07:47.500- 07:52.500* :  different phase, to a less intensive phase. In other words, to change the way it's fighting this
*07:52.540- 08:00.040* :  war from intensive bombardment of airstrikes and artillery strikes and drone strikes to far more
*08:00.040- 08:06.800* :  kind of finely tuned special forces, raids, more focused actions. I'm not sure that either,
*08:06.800- 08:12.040* :  frankly, is going to yield the results that Israel has set itself out to achieve in this war,
*08:12.040- 08:19.360* :  which is to eliminate Hamas as a fighting force and to get the hostages released. Israel has not
*08:19.360- 08:26.240* :  the war cabinet has now authorised the head of Israel's intelligence service to explore
*08:26.240- 08:31.100* :  a second round of negotiations with the Qataris. So, to come back to your question,
*08:31.100- 08:36.840* :  quite an interesting comment from Joev Galant, who is the Israeli Defence Minister, who said that
*08:36.840- 08:43.600* :  Israel is not going to be providing the civil administration of Gaza. There's a lot of discussion
*08:43.600- 08:49.020* :  here about who is going to run Gaza, and that's not clear. Yes, absolutely, because at some point,
*08:49.020- 08:54.320* :  this conflict has to end, and we're seeing this big difference between the US. It wants to return
*08:54.320- 09:00.260* :  to the two-state solution, whereas Israel is talking about getting rid of Hamas, but it's equally
*09:00.260- 09:05.580* :  opposed to Fata, the Palestinian Authority, that governs parts of the West Bank, also they can
*09:05.580- 09:12.000* :  control of Gaza. I mean, Fata is very discredited. The Palestinian Authority, they are seen as corrupt,
*09:12.000- 09:18.020* :  old, inefficient, unpopular, partly because they fail to produce the promised results,
*09:18.780- 09:23.040* :  which is not entirely their fault, but then again, you know, the rest of the Middle East,
*09:23.040- 09:27.620* :  the Gulf Arab states, if you remember, they signed the Abraham Accords a few years ago with Israel,
*09:27.620- 09:32.420* :  because they got fed up with waiting for the Palestinian Authority to actually sort of deliver
*09:32.420- 09:39.740* :  on a peace deal. But I'm afraid I'm fairly pessimistic long-term about the chances of peace holding,
*09:39.740- 09:45.260* :  even if they have a ceasefire, because Hamas, you can destroy their weapons, you can blurb their
*09:45.260- 09:50.520* :  tunnels, you can get rid of their arsenals, and you can kill their fighters, but you can't kill
*09:50.520- 09:55.680* :  an ideology unless you've got a better one, and in the absence of the promise of a proper sovereign
*09:55.680- 10:01.700* :  Palestinian state, it's going to be very hard to steer all those thousands of angry young men
*10:01.700- 10:07.560* :  in Gaza, and the West Bank for that matter, away from a path of violence, if you can't offer
*10:07.560- 10:11.960* :  them a viable alternative, because they are fed up with the current situation in the West Bank,
*10:12.460- 10:18.740* :  the settlers, and this was something that Lloyd Austin did condemn, the violence by these now
*10:18.740- 10:25.320* :  quite heavily armed settlers, Israeli settlers who are colonizing what should be the future land
*10:25.320- 10:31.100* :  of the Palestinian state that they've been promised, and the peace talks. Long-term pulse apart,
*10:31.100- 10:37.020* :  Hamas doesn't want Israel to exist, and this Israeli government doesn't really, at least,
*10:37.020- 10:43.080* :  elements of it do not believe in a two-state solution. Frank Gardner in Jerusalem. The oil giant
*10:43.080- 10:48.420* :  BP and the shipping company Evergreen have joined some of the world's other leading freight operators
*10:48.420- 10:54.960* :  in suspending routes through the Red Sea. Attacks on vessels by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen,
*10:54.960- 11:01.680* :  which began after the war in Gaza have now increased to a nearly daily basis. Many ships are being
*11:01.680- 11:07.520* :  re-rooted around the Cape of Good Hope to avoid the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. The US has promised
*11:07.520- 11:12.680* :  to form an international coalition to protect merchant shipping and the Red Sea from attacks by
*11:12.680- 11:17.620* :  the Houthi rebels. The US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he'd convened a meeting on Tuesday
*11:17.620- 11:23.660* :  to discuss how to tackle the issue. These attacks are reckless, dangerous, and they violate
*11:23.660- 11:29.940* :  international law, and so we're taking action to build an international coalition to address this
*11:29.940- 11:36.420* :  threat, and I would remind you that this is not just a US issue. This is an international problem,
*11:36.420- 11:42.900* :  and it deserves an international response. The Red Sea is a vital route for freight traveling between
*11:42.900- 11:48.660* :  the Asian and European markets. Sam Fenik spoke to Guy Platon, the Secretary General at the
*11:48.660- 11:53.980* :  International Chamber of Shipping, one of the world's principal shipping organizations. So how
*11:53.980- 11:59.100* :  serious is the situation? It's very serious. We've had seen numerous attacks on merchant ships,
*11:59.220- 12:02.900* :  and we've been deploring the actions of the Houthis in as strong as possible terms,
*12:02.900- 12:06.860* :  and we need to see the immediate cessation of these attacks, because these acts of aggression
*12:06.900- 12:12.140* :  threaten the lives of innocent seafarers, and of course, the safety of the merchant shipping and
*12:12.500- 12:16.780* :  a flagrant breach of international law. So we take this very seriously, and as you've
*12:16.780- 12:21.920* :  your report says, a number of the major container lines have now paused, traffic going through
*12:21.920- 12:26.060* :  the Red Sea, and re-diverting them. We heard that BP is, and we know many other companies are
*12:26.060- 12:30.040* :  considering their position at the moment. So for the industry, this is very serious indeed,
*12:30.040- 12:35.480* :  and we want to see stability returned. I want to ask you about shipping routes in a moment,
*12:35.480- 12:39.920* :  but just explain to us what the type of attacks these are. I understand some are using drones.
*12:40.040- 12:44.880* :  Yeah, we've seen drones, and I think there's been some missile attacks as well. Luckily,
*12:44.960- 12:49.700* :  there's been no one hurt, and I think that's one thing we can hold on to, but it's only a matter of
*12:49.700- 12:54.120* :  time, and it's, I think, just why companies are taking the difficult decision to re-root their
*12:54.120- 12:58.700* :  ships, because they have to think of the safety of their seafarers as a primary concern.
*12:59.100- 13:03.720* :  So it doesn't mean that ships are not moving. They're taking different routes that might be
*13:03.720- 13:08.060* :  a longer way around. Is that right? Yes, that's correct. So the shortest route in terms of trade
*13:08.060- 13:13.180* :  routes between Europe and Asia is through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, and we saw when the ever
*13:13.180- 13:18.900* :  given round of ground in the Suez Canal in March 21, that then causes a blockage in that route.
*13:18.900- 13:23.200* :  So the only other way round is to go around the Cape of Good Hope, which adds between six and
*13:23.200- 13:29.460* :  14 days to avoid, depending on the ship type, and additional 9,000 kilometres. So it's not
*13:29.460- 13:33.260* :  a stop trade, but it's going to disrupt it, and it's going to delay things. And what sort of
*13:33.260- 13:38.460* :  freight goes through this particular area? I mean, BP has said that they're stopping their ships
*13:38.460- 13:44.220* :  using this particular route. So oil is an obvious one, but what other things go through it?
*13:44.420- 13:47.540* :  So it'll be oil, it'll be gas, it'll be containers, so you know, general goods,
*13:47.940- 13:52.360* :  just about everything which is going between Asia and Europe will pass through the Red Sea,
*13:52.900- 13:57.800* :  and I think as your report said, 12% of global trade, you know, $3 to $6 billion a day goes
*13:57.800- 14:02.200* :  through that, you know, 1.4 trillion a year through that solar sea, so it's actually key strategic
*14:02.200- 14:06.420* :  waterway. Now I platinum the Secretary General at the International Chamber of Shipping.
*14:07.160- 14:12.400* :  There are fears of a widening humanitarian catastrophe in Sudan, as the paramilitary rapid support
*14:12.400- 14:18.120* :  forces who've been fighting the army since April have reportedly captured a city south of Khartoum.
*14:18.340- 14:23.000* :  Wad Madani was a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of people who had fled the capital.
*14:23.560- 14:26.100* :  Our Africa Regional Editor Will Ross reports.
*14:26.100- 14:32.040* :  Terrified residents of Wad Madani say gunmen from Sudan's paramilitary rapid support forces
*14:32.040- 14:37.200* :  have spread out across the city. The RSF has an appalling reputation for human rights abuses,
*14:37.620- 14:42.280* :  and there are reports that looting has already begun. People have been trying to get out of the city,
*14:42.280- 14:46.340* :  but that's not easy. There's a fuel shortage, and there are gunmen along the roads.
*14:47.020- 14:52.780* :  International efforts to stop this war have all failed. The army leadership and the RSF have
*14:52.780- 14:58.700* :  chosen to fight on. Since April nearly 7 million people have been displaced, now it's impossible
*14:58.700- 15:05.180* :  to know where is safe in Sudan. Will Ross, a senior Ukrainian commander says the country is
*15:05.180- 15:10.020* :  scaling back some military operations because of a shortfall in foreign defense aid.
*15:10.700- 15:16.220* :  Brigadier General Alexander Tanevsky was speaking as talks in the US continue to try to unlock
*15:16.220- 15:22.320* :  a multi-billion dollar package which has been stalled by Republicans in Congress. Jessica Parker
*15:22.320- 15:28.280* :  reports from Kiev. These are frank admissions from Alexander Tanevsky, even if much of what he
*15:28.280- 15:33.800* :  said is widely known. Speaking to Reuters, he acknowledged ammunition shortages and said that in
*15:33.800- 15:39.520* :  some areas troops were moving into defensive mode. The Brigadier General, who's in charge of a
*15:39.520- 15:45.140* :  large stretch of the front line, said help from the west was still arriving, but that it was not
*15:49.080- 15:54.300* :  enough. The volumes that we have today are not sufficient for us, given our needs, so we are
*15:54.300- 16:00.540* :  redistributing it. We are replaning tasks that we had set for ourselves and making them smaller.
*16:03.620- 16:09.260* :  A 60 billion dollar US defense aid package remains stuck because of congressional wrangling.
*16:09.680- 16:14.280* :  Nevertheless, Alexander Tanevsky said Ukraine would not give up, even hinting at
*16:14.280- 16:20.800* :  further large-scale actions in future. The EU will attempt to unlock crucial economic aid for
*16:20.800- 16:26.240* :  Ukraine at a newly announced summit in February after the package was blocked by the Hungarian
*16:26.240- 16:33.200* :  Prime Minister Viktor Orban last week. Jessica Parker. This year, Russia's elite marine unit,
*16:33.200- 16:39.480* :  the 155th, was nearly wiped out on the front line in Ukraine. A year ago, these same soldiers,
*16:39.480- 16:44.520* :  also known as the Black Beres, were warning that they were being slaughtered. The Russian authorities
*16:44.520- 16:51.100* :  denied the number of losses. But a BBCI investigation can now show how glaring tactical mistakes
*16:51.100- 16:57.880* :  cost young Russian Marines their lives despite repeated warnings. Vicky Aurekleyen reports.
*17:01.700- 17:08.060* :  25-year-old Rama Skorgadze rev career was just taking off on TikTok when he was called up to fight
*17:08.060- 17:14.520* :  with President Putin. Before leaving the small village in Russia's Far East region,
*17:15.000- 17:19.520* :  where he had grown up, he sat goodbye to his mother and wrote a song about the conflict.
*17:25.160- 17:30.980* :  In September last year, Rama joined the elite 155th Marine Brigade, also known as the Black Beres.
*17:31.460- 17:35.940* :  This unit was accused by the Ukrainians of war crimes in Butcher earlier that year.
*17:39.000- 17:44.380* :  Hi mom, we arrived at the grounds. We are checking our inventory. They haven't fed us yet,
*17:44.380- 17:49.920* :  nothing is really clear. Rama's was now 7,000 kilometers away from his mother,
*17:50.520- 17:56.020* :  in the Donetsk region of Donbas. Rama sent a last message to his mother, before heading to the front.
*17:56.100- 18:01.660* :  Now we are moving to the checkpoints near the front line. Love you, keep your fingers crossed.
*18:02.440- 18:04.800* :  Don't worry too much. I'll be careful.
*18:05.520- 18:10.380* :  Rama's first mission, the battle for the towns of Pavlivka in Volodar, was a death trap.
*18:11.140- 18:17.240* :  We came under so much fire, so many corpses, guys were just torn in tune near me.
*18:17.240- 18:22.660* :  It's worse than hell. Testimonies like this started to appear online, and by November,
*18:23.120- 18:27.940* :  a letter written by the Black Beres to their regional governor, Olyak Kuzhameka, went viral.
*18:28.640- 18:33.560* :  They accused in apt commanders of throwing them into an incomprehensible offensive, where they
*18:33.560- 18:39.180* :  lost 300 men in just four days. The soldiers also asked for an independent investigation,
*18:39.920- 18:42.420* :  but their claims were denied by governor Kuzhameka.
*18:44.740- 18:50.560* :  Yes, there are losses, there's heavy fighting going on, but there are far fewer than what they say in
*18:50.560- 18:56.320* :  their appeal. BBCI can now reveal this battle was one of the highest concentrations of losses for
*18:56.320- 19:01.540* :  a single Russian unit since the beginning of the war. But why? We've analyzed hundreds of
*19:01.540- 19:06.100* :  hours of battle footage and found the Russian troops making catastrophic errors on the ground.
*19:06.960- 19:11.860* :  Typhon Osberg worked alongside Russian Marines during his career as a Turkish naval officer.
*19:12.460- 19:16.240* :  We showed him videos of the battle to understand the Russian behavior in the field.
*19:16.240- 19:23.080* :  They didn't apply the fundamentals of land warfare in this video, and they are just sending
*19:23.080- 19:29.520* :  the troops from a narrow line to the death. Without mind clearance operation, without
*19:29.520- 19:37.720* :  air reconnaissance operation, without enough intelligence supported with thermal and other
*19:37.720- 19:43.160* :  electro-optical imaging, such kind of breaching operations are suicide.
*19:43.940- 19:48.080* :  An investigation by the Russian military prosecutor into the fate of the Black Beres,
*19:48.660- 19:53.740* :  published five weeks after their appeal to governor Kuzhameka, found no wrongdoing by their
*19:53.740- 19:59.980* :  commanders. By DeSamba's Atlanta, the mother of the young rapper Ramas had not heard from her son
*19:59.980- 20:05.860* :  for weeks, and desperate to find him, she and several other family members traveled 7,000
*20:05.860- 20:12.020* :  kilometers to the Donetsk region. There she found her answer. Ramas was dead. He had been killed
*20:12.020- 20:17.820* :  in the battle by a drone strike. In late January 2023, Russia tried to take Volodar again.
*20:17.860- 20:22.680* :  Launching the largest assault on the town since the beginning of the war. Again, the
*20:22.680- 20:28.640* :  Marines of the 155th Brigade were involved. Again, the men were caught in a death trap. Again,
*20:29.300- 20:33.800* :  they raised the alarm in a second letter. When President Putin was asked about the fate of the
*20:33.800- 20:41.620* :  Marines, this is what he responded. Marine infantry is working properly right now and fighting
*20:41.620- 20:47.680* :  heroically, both Pacific and Northern Fleet. Neither the Russian Ministry of Defense nor
*20:47.680- 20:53.440* :  Governor Kuzhameka responded to the second appeal. We contacted Governor Kuzhameka about our findings,
*20:53.440- 21:00.220* :  but he did not respond. One year later, Volodar, or its left of it, is still a contested
*21:00.220- 21:06.900* :  battlefield. That report by Vicki Arekoyan. Still to come?
*21:11.160- 21:16.180* :  When the holiday season rolls around, Dave Giambri's candy shop in Clementine, New Jersey,
*21:16.180- 21:22.560* :  is bustling. Customers come for the candy canes. But convictionary companies in the US
*21:22.900- 21:26.940* :  aren't quite as festive as usual. The price of sugar has gone up.

*23:10.660- 23:15.760* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. A female serial killer in China has been
*23:15.760- 23:22.140* :  executed more than 20 years after she and her boyfriend work together to murder seven people.
*23:22.880- 23:27.900* :  Our China media analyst, Carrie Allen, told us more about a case that has horrified,
*23:28.400- 23:30.540* :  but also gripped much of China.
*23:31.240- 23:38.080* :  Laorangji, she's become a notorious figure in China, because her and her then-boyfriend Fadziying,
*23:38.200- 23:44.780* :  they carried out a series of robberies, kidnappings, and killings in four Chinese provinces in the
*23:44.780- 23:50.340* :  late 90s. And so they kind of became dubbed Chinese Bonnie and Clyde. They moved around,
*23:50.500- 23:56.740* :  carrying out these horrific acts. And she's actually, she spent two decades on the run.
*23:57.200- 24:01.420* :  Her her boyfriend, Fadziying, he was caught and executed back in 1999.
*24:01.540- 24:08.200* :  But she was only arrested in 2019. And today, yes, she's been executed.
*24:08.940- 24:14.240* :  And why has she been executed only now four years after she was finally caught?
*24:14.540- 24:18.860* :  There are a number of reasons for this. Things have changed a lot since the 90s in China.
*24:18.860- 24:24.740* :  I mean, first of all, when she was captured, it was just before the global pandemic began.
*24:24.740- 24:29.920* :  So there were lockdowns in place and China had zero COVID measures that were very, very strict in
*24:29.920- 24:35.580* :  the country. So things like legal proceedings that there were delays anyway. But also as well,
*24:35.580- 24:43.580* :  in the 90s in China, when suspects were arrested and charged, it was very quickly that's
*24:43.580- 24:49.560* :  executions would be carried out. And there have been criticisms since that some were carried out
*24:49.560- 24:56.060* :  after police officers tortured people in detention. So now that they take a bit longer,
*24:56.560- 25:00.800* :  there are appeals in China. So that is another reason that it's taken a long time to happen.
*25:01.040- 25:04.620* :  The story about her execution is really dominated Chinese media today.
*25:05.320- 25:11.340* :  It has, yes, it's very rare that you would hear of a female Chinese serial killer in the country.
*25:11.340- 25:17.300* :  This is why she's been such a notorious figure. And also as well, in media, a lot of people saw that
*25:17.620- 25:22.900* :  while she was on the run, they've seen pictures in newspapers of her time when she was living
*25:22.900- 25:28.480* :  under various identities. She was working as a waitress at this one picture that's been circulated
*25:28.480- 25:35.080* :  quite widely shows her wearing a Santa hat and a short dress. It looks like she's having fun.
*25:35.380- 25:41.700* :  She was quite young at the time of the offences. She was only in her 20s. And she was 49 when
*25:41.700- 25:46.600* :  she was executed. And she did try to claim in her defense that she'd been coerced?
*25:46.920- 25:53.800* :  She did, yes. Media have said that she was raped by her former boyfriend and that she basically
*25:53.800- 25:59.680* :  hero worshipped him and that this played a role in the crimes. But I've also seen reports in
*25:59.680- 26:05.060* :  state media saying that she was responsible for picking targets at entertainment venues
*26:05.740- 26:10.500* :  and then getting her boyfriend to attack them. And also as well, I think why this has been such
*26:10.500- 26:18.120* :  a horrific case for Chinese people to read about is that in one case in particular, after a man
*26:18.120- 26:23.720* :  was murdered, the couple went to the victim's residence and they also murdered not only his wife,
*26:23.720- 26:29.320* :  but his two-year-old daughter. One thing that I am seeing a lot of today in Chinese media are reports
*26:29.320- 26:36.280* :  that she spoke to some of the relatives of victims and very much did want to show her remorse.
*26:36.780- 26:42.300* :  Keryalan, thousands of tractors have blocked the centre of the German capital Berlin in a protest
*26:42.300- 26:47.380* :  against new environmental regulations and the price of diesel. Rachel Wright reports.
*26:48.240- 26:54.000* :  As many as 6,000 tractors brought the area around the Brandenburg Gate to a halt with some dumping
*26:54.000- 26:59.060* :  manure on the road, the president of the German Farmers Association warned the government that if it
*26:59.060- 27:03.560* :  didn't withdraw its proposed measures to remove tax breaks and subsidies for diesel,
*27:03.560- 27:09.240* :  the farmers would demonstrate on January the 8th in a way the country has never experienced before.
*27:09.760- 27:14.040* :  Last week, the federal government announced plans to save around a billion dollars after a
*27:14.040- 27:19.340* :  constitutional court ruled its plans to pay off its debt were unconstitutional. The ruling blew
*27:19.340- 27:24.340* :  a hole in government spending plans and plunged Olaf Schultz three-way coalition into turmoil.
*27:25.460- 27:30.860* :  Rachel Wright. Roman Catholic Church has granted approval for priests to perform blessings for
*27:30.860- 27:36.840* :  same-sex couples. It said they must not be linked to weddings or civil unions that would not be
*27:36.840- 27:42.380* :  part of regular church rituals, but the decision still marks a significant change in policy.
*27:42.380- 27:49.860* :  As Sophia Petitzer explains. Just two years ago, the Catholic Church said it could not bless same-sex
*27:49.860- 27:57.960* :  couples, as God does not bless sin, but Pope Francis has approved a document that will allow priests
*27:57.960- 28:04.940* :  to administer a blessing to LGBT couples, as long as it is not part of regular church rituals
*28:04.940- 28:10.920* :  or liturgies. The Vatican made it clear that the development does not change its position
*28:10.920- 28:16.320* :  and marriage, which he continues to consider as a union between a man and a woman.
*28:17.140- 28:22.940* :  While some will view the decision as narrow in scope, it represents a significant shift,
*28:23.800- 28:29.260* :  given that the Catholic Church continues to teach that homosexual acts are sinful.
*28:30.280- 28:36.220* :  But since he was elected Pope ten years ago, Francis as sought to adopt a more inclusive
*28:36.220- 28:43.820* :  approach towards LGBT people, much to the disdain of conservative cardinals. The Vatican said the
*28:43.820- 28:50.980* :  ruling should be seen as a sign that God welcomes all. Sophia Petitzer. A drug that aims to
*28:50.980- 28:56.680* :  prevent hot flushes during the menopause has been approved for use in the UK. The non-hormonal
*28:56.680- 29:02.660* :  treatment may benefit women for whom HRT is not suitable, although it is not yet available
*29:02.660- 29:09.240* :  on the publicly funded National Health Service or NHS. The drug is already in use in the US where
*29:09.240- 29:15.920* :  monthly treatment costs over $500. One of the scientists who led pioneering trials of the drug
*29:15.920- 29:21.180* :  called it a game-changing blockbuster. Here's our medical editor, Fergus Walsh.
*29:21.460- 29:27.080* :  Up to eight in ten women going through the menopause experience hot flushes and night sweats.
*29:27.740- 29:34.600* :  The new drug called Vioza, also known as Fesilinitant, works by blocking a protein in the brain
*29:34.600- 29:40.840* :  involved in regulating body temperature. It could be suitable for women who can't take HRT
*29:40.840- 29:48.280* :  such as those with a history of cancer or blood clots. Elaine Barker, who's 68, was on a trial
*29:48.280- 29:55.320* :  of this type of compound and the daily tablet made a huge difference. My symptoms improved immensely
*29:56.120- 30:01.400* :  and it's just great, a great feeling, not just for me, but for the future for us women who
*30:01.400- 30:06.300* :  suffered with it. The drug doesn't deal with other symptoms of the menopause such as fatigue
*30:06.300- 30:14.520* :  and mood swings. Common side effects include diarrhea and insomnia. Vioza is now licensed for
*30:14.520- 30:21.020* :  private prescription, but the health body nice is not due to assess it for the NHS until next summer.
*30:21.440- 30:27.020* :  Fergus Walsh. Now to the United States, bombons and red and white candy canes dominate the
*30:27.020- 30:32.500* :  holiday season there, but confectionery companies aren't feeling quite as festive as normal this year
*30:32.920- 30:38.200* :  because the price of making their suites has risen, and that in turn means customers are paying more
*30:38.440- 30:41.800* :  as our North America business correspondent Erin Delmore reports.
*30:45.940- 30:50.960* :  When the holiday season rolls around, Dave Giambri's candy shop in Clementine, New Jersey,
*30:51.260- 30:52.080* :  is bustling.
*30:54.440- 30:56.140* :  Customers come for the candy canes.
*31:00.360- 31:05.400* :  Dave's candy canes are made almost entirely of sugar and all are made by hand.
*31:06.000- 31:10.700* :  The sugar mix is folded and prodded and twisted into that famous red and white pattern.
*31:12.380- 31:17.560* :  As we mold the sweet treats, Dave tells me that his main ingredient is now costing him more.
*31:17.900- 31:25.020* :  This year I did have a slight 4-5% increase on the final product. I want to say sugar went up
*31:26.160- 31:28.460* :  maybe 15% on last year.
*31:29.400- 31:33.440* :  He's not the only one feeling the pinch. The cost of sugar is rising worldwide,
*31:33.440- 31:38.460* :  and it's rising in the US where protectionist policy props up domestic producers.
*31:38.900- 31:43.240* :  The US is the world's fifth largest sugar producer with sugar cane grown in the south
*31:43.520- 31:47.120* :  and sugar beats in the North. The US is also a top consumer.
*31:52.780- 31:57.280* :  To find out more about that, we went to the land of Mardi Gras and Jazz bands.
*31:57.940- 32:01.440* :  Why? Because Louisiana is also the home of sugar cane.
*32:02.020- 32:05.420* :  We drove an hour and a half west of New Orleans to visit one farm.
*32:05.980- 32:09.940* :  Louisiana is the northernmost point where sugar cane is grown commercially.
*32:09.940- 32:15.480* :  We're about a mile away from the Mississippi River and thousands of years of flooding left naturally
*32:15.480- 32:19.020* :  occurring fertile topsoil, perfect for growing sugar cane.
*32:21.220- 32:25.040* :  My name is Patrick Frischer. It's a sugar cane farmer in Placman, Louisiana.
*32:25.540- 32:29.580* :  So how does sugar go from being something that you grow here to something that I go to the store
*32:29.580- 32:34.260* :  and I pick up out of a box on the shelf? We'll plant a whole stalk in the ground and the following
*32:34.260- 32:40.260* :  year we'll go through the billet harvester harvest that cane. So this is a John your C-H570
*32:40.720- 32:43.640* :  sugar cane billet harvester. All it does is cut sugar cane.
*32:44.540- 32:49.560* :  Goes into an 18-wheeler, goes to the mill and the mill presses the juice out of that sugar cane,
*32:49.560- 32:53.600* :  that stalk the sugar cane. The mill is the middleman between the farm and the refinery.
*32:53.600- 32:57.360* :  It's where the sugar cane starts to look like the sugar we keep in our kitchens.
*32:57.900- 33:02.020* :  My name is Charlie Schudemack. I'm the chief operating officer of Core Texas Sugar Mill
*33:02.640- 33:06.280* :  and we're in White Castle, Louisiana. Sugar canes like a sponge you have to wet it and squeeze it
*33:06.280- 33:10.180* :  except it's stubborn. It doesn't want to give out that juice so it takes about 800 tons of force
*33:10.580- 33:13.920* :  on top of the cane to squeeze all that juice out. The Department of Agriculture
*33:13.920- 33:18.220* :  protects domestic sugar production from foreign competition by taxing imports.
*33:18.800- 33:23.000* :  A report by the government accountability office in October found that the sugar program
*33:23.000- 33:27.600* :  creates higher prices and that Americans pay around twice the world price for sugar.
*33:27.820- 33:31.620* :  While the sugar farmers benefit it's not like they don't have other problems.
*33:32.160- 33:36.440* :  Last year we had a very good crop. The problem with input costs were quite frankly through the
*33:36.440- 33:42.760* :  roof. The potassium for example, $198 a ton went to $1,000 a ton. You have to apply that nutrient
*33:42.760- 33:47.400* :  to the crop so you have to take that hit. So the more even though it could be a great crop
*33:47.400- 33:51.880* :  with an average or even above average price for your commodity, you're still feeling the squeeze
*33:51.880- 33:56.100* :  and there's almost no way to plan for it. Can a farm like yours compete with foreign sugar?
*33:56.580- 34:01.860* :  Our farm and American sugar farmers in general out compete anybody in the world. We just can't
