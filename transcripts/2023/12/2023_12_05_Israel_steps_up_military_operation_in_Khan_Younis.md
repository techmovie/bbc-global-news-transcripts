*00:48.920- 00:52.340* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:54.380- 01:00.980* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday, the 5th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:01.340- 01:06.000* :  Israeli forces appear to be mounting a major military operation in southern Gaza,
*01:06.440- 01:10.020* :  where conditions for civilians are reportedly ever more perilous.
*01:10.460- 01:15.500* :  The Nigerian president has called for a full investigation into military drone strikes that
*01:15.500- 01:20.260* :  have killed dozens of villages. And the British government is taking further steps at home
*01:20.580- 01:23.500* :  and abroad to tighten its immigration policies.
*01:26.260- 01:30.480* :  Also in this podcast, thousands of people have taken to the streets of New Zealand
*01:30.480- 01:34.460* :  to join demonstrations against the new coalition government. And
*01:38.800- 01:42.460* :  You see her? Do you know why you're here? Bad luck I guess.
*01:43.820- 01:49.120* :  We look at the latest trailer for Grand Theft Auto, which has been released early after it was
*01:49.120- 01:57.060* :  leaked online. The World Health Organization says the situation in Gaza is getting worse by the
*01:57.060- 02:02.400* :  hour with intensified bombing by Israeli forces around the southern towns of Han Unis and Raffa.
*02:02.720- 02:08.440* :  An Israeli spokesman said the government expected difficult combat in this latest phase of its
*02:08.440- 02:13.820* :  offensive. Israeli ground troops are stepping up their operation in Han Unis with what the Israeli
*02:13.820- 02:20.020* :  Defence Force described as close-quarter fighting and aerial bombardment. The Ft. Colonel Richard
*02:20.020- 02:26.400* :  Hect is an IDF spokesman. Since the hostilities have returned, we're expanding our operations
*02:26.400- 02:35.920* :  against Hamas across all of Gaza. We're targeting operatives, infrastructure and mainly the tunnel
*02:35.920- 02:44.000* :  network. So far we have located over 800 tunnel shafts and destroyed 500 of these.
*02:45.280- 02:53.740* :  The level of fortification is unprecedented. While we've been operating, we are ensuring that
*02:53.740- 02:58.620* :  there is minimum harm to civilians with soldiers on the ground going from building to building.
*02:59.480- 03:04.620* :  Many international organizations have expressed concern about the deteriorating situation inside
*03:04.620- 03:10.580* :  Gaza and a spokesperson for the Gaza and Health Ministry which is controlled by Hamas said the
*03:10.580- 03:18.100* :  situation in hospitals there was catastrophic. The wounded and patients are on the floor. There's no
*03:18.100- 03:23.360* :  life-saving health service in the hospitals of the southern Gaza Strip. Hence, hospitals in the
*03:23.360- 03:28.540* :  southern Gaza Strip have totally collapsed. They cannot deal with the injuries that arrive. It's
*03:28.540- 03:33.240* :  difficult for ambulances to reach the injured in the targeted areas. The Israeli occupation
*03:33.240- 03:39.360* :  target ambulance is that move in the southern areas of the Gaza Strip. The violence has also
*03:39.360- 03:45.400* :  displaced many Palestinians multiple times, including Gada Al-Kherd, who has lost loved ones to
*03:45.400- 03:51.260* :  Israeli estrikes and is now cut off from most of her family. She spoke to Michelle Hussain from
*03:51.260- 03:58.280* :  Khan Unis about what life is like there. We have to go far away to the market to bring some food.
*03:58.640- 04:06.000* :  Maybe two kilometers or three kilometers. It's considered like par and estrikes like it's in
*04:06.000- 04:12.400* :  everywhere. So we are taking the risk to go to bring some only vegetables. There's no fruit
*04:12.920- 04:19.600* :  and meat. It's very rare. We cannot like bring meat and it's very expensive. It's like
*04:19.660- 04:29.060* :  nowadays the prices inside the shelter. Some people are coming to sell some food, but it's not
*04:29.060- 04:37.220* :  enough. And what about money? Do your family have cash or do you still have access to banks?
*04:38.440- 04:43.960* :  Well, it's very difficult. We were like there was some cash with us for the first month,
*04:43.960- 04:51.060* :  the second month, but nowadays it's almost like finished. So even the bank accounts like we cannot
*04:51.060- 04:57.400* :  go to the banks, even if it's closed, even Western Union, also we have to wait like for a couple of
*04:57.400- 05:05.100* :  hours to get some money. What are you prepared for? Do you think you might end up having to move
*05:05.100- 05:12.000* :  again? We're discussing this in the morning, me and my sister. And I say for her like, where to go?
*05:12.440- 05:20.100* :  This is the fifth place that we are evacuating to. Like we were in Guaz city, then we moved to a
*05:20.100- 05:27.160* :  shifa hospital at the street, then we moved to another in Guaz city, and we moved to a middle
*05:27.160- 05:34.740* :  area. They are going to say like, carry all of your stuff. You know, this is the winter season.
*05:36.060- 05:40.780* :  I'm at least correspondent Yolanda Nell gave me the latest on Israel's military campaign.
*05:41.520- 05:45.980* :  We've seen that Israel is intensified. It's bombing in and around Guaz's second largest city,
*05:45.980- 05:51.780* :  Han Yunus, which is in the south. As its ground forces are also advancing there, local say that they
*05:51.780- 05:58.700* :  have seen Israeli tanks and armored vehicles to the east of the city and also to the north as well.
*05:59.100- 06:04.480* :  Now, a lot of people at the Nasser hospital, one of the main hospitals in Han Yunus,
*06:04.680- 06:09.640* :  people being rushed in there this morning, dozens of wounded people after an area in the east
*06:09.640- 06:15.360* :  was hit by Israeli shelling, local people said, and also by strikes. This is an area close to
*06:15.360- 06:20.620* :  UN school that's been used as a shelter for displaced people. And Palestinian said that there were
*06:20.620- 06:27.680* :  about 30 people who were killed. Now, besides those kind of chaotic scenes, we've also had
*06:28.080- 06:33.120* :  a lot of people on the road once again, many of them people who've been displaced that are heading
*06:34.300- 06:39.100* :  further to the south, heeding these Israeli evacuation orders affect tens of thousands of
*06:39.100- 06:44.180* :  people living in about 20 neighborhoods to the east of Han Yunus. And the Israeli military
*06:44.180- 06:50.100* :  extremely worried about any female captured soldiers which are taken by Hamas. Indeed, there have
*06:50.100- 06:57.080* :  been these fears about sexual violence from the 7th of October back when we've had many people
*06:57.080- 07:03.820* :  who are either victims or witnesses to sexual assaults carried out. They say by Hamas fighters and
*07:03.820- 07:09.460* :  others involved in those attacks. So that is said to have been used as a kind of weapon of war,
*07:09.460- 07:14.820* :  really, by Hamas. And now, there is a lot of concern. The US State Department has been voicing
*07:14.820- 07:20.560* :  concern about the women who are still being held. Many of them are soldiers. Certainly,
*07:20.560- 07:26.440* :  we know as well that there is this division between categories of people by Hamas. Well,
*07:26.440- 07:32.620* :  it's allowed out women and children in the first stages of the hostage exchange. We're told
*07:32.620- 07:38.680* :  also that Hamas views any women who are serving in the Israeli military different from the other
*07:38.680- 07:45.000* :  women that were affected there. And there's also been talk about Israel flooding Gaza's tunnels.
*07:45.020- 07:50.820* :  Yes, this is a report in the Wall Street Journal. Israel has set up large pumps on the coast that
*07:50.820- 07:55.660* :  could be used to flood tunnels used by Hamas and other armed groups. This big network under
*07:55.660- 08:00.480* :  the Gaza Strip. The newspaper says the Israeli military has said since it can't comment on the
*08:00.480- 08:05.600* :  report, but it's saying that it's doing everything it can to make the tunnel system in Gaza unusable.
*08:06.460- 08:13.040* :  Yehland now in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, in Israel, how much are people concerned with the widening
*08:13.040- 08:18.980* :  of the military campaign in Gaza? Hemi Shalevas and Israeli commentator, he spoke to Rob Young.
*08:19.660- 08:24.700* :  There have been no pause about the specific widening of the conflict. But generally speaking,
*08:24.700- 08:31.000* :  there's been massive support for the government's aim of eradicating Hamas or destroying Hamas or
*08:31.000- 08:37.800* :  neutralizing it. And there's been very little opposition heard either in the polls or in the
*08:37.800- 08:43.780* :  public arena. What about the resumption of fighting, though, given that there are still some 130
*08:43.780- 08:49.620* :  Israeli hostages thought to be held in the Gaza Strip? That is the complicating factor because
*08:49.620- 08:54.560* :  there's a lot of support for the families of the kidnapped. And there are people who believe that
*08:54.560- 08:59.680* :  their cancellation of the agreement and the resumption of hostilities, and naturally they fear that
*08:59.680- 09:05.260* :  it endangers the hostages. But nonetheless, and even though there is a lot of sympathy for their
*09:05.260- 09:10.940* :  position and they think that negotiations should have continued, nonetheless, I don't see any real
*09:10.940- 09:15.080* :  opposition to the widening of the war. At this point, for the next few days at least, I don't think
*09:15.080- 09:21.220* :  such opposition is likely to appear anyone. And we're hearing that almost 16,000 people have been
*09:21.220- 09:26.960* :  killed in the Gaza Strip. Since Israeli military action began, people who had fled from the north
*09:26.960- 09:32.820* :  of that territory to the south and are being told they must move further south as Israel's bombing
*09:32.820- 09:41.260* :  campaign widens. What is the view of Israelis, of the tactics which are being used, of the humanitarian
*09:41.500- 09:46.780* :  disaster which appears to be unfolding in the Gaza Strip? Well, I think objectively speaking,
*09:46.780- 09:54.940* :  Israelis have not been subjected to the kind of television pictures and reports from Gaza that you
*09:54.940- 10:01.100* :  and everyone else in the world is seeing. The Israeli media has reported on the destruction in Gaza,
*10:01.100- 10:08.000* :  but profoundly not at length. And so there is no reaction to the civilian toll, but I have to
*10:08.000- 10:13.200* :  point out one thing, even though for you and the rest of the world, October 7th was almost two
*10:13.200- 10:20.760* :  months ago. For Israelis, it's still going on. The 90, 80%, 70% of the reports on TV don't have to do
*10:20.760- 10:25.680* :  with the military campaign that's going on now or with any other matter, but rather with the events
*10:25.680- 10:32.600* :  of October 7th, which were so widespread, horrific, and multiple, that almost eight weeks later,
*10:32.600- 10:38.520* :  they're still bear telling. So I think psychologically, Israelis have yet to move on from the shock,
*10:38.520- 10:43.600* :  the anger, and the rage of October 7th, which means that they are less inclined to
*10:43.860- 10:48.340* :  view or to take an interest even in the how much damage is being caused in Gaza.
*10:48.940- 10:53.320* :  Hemi, Charlotte, speaking to Rob Young, and we'll hear more about the conflict later
*10:53.320- 11:00.160* :  with a special report from the occupied West Bank. More than 80 people have died in Nigeria after
*11:00.160- 11:05.320* :  Army drones struck a village in Kaduna State. The drones were meant to be targeting militants,
*11:05.320- 11:10.720* :  but attacked the village during a Muslim festival. I asked our correspondent in Lagos,
*11:10.720- 11:18.100* :  Azizat, Olau Lua, how the strike happened. So Muslim faithful were said to be celebrating the
*11:18.100- 11:24.300* :  birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and then before the new, what would happen, the military
*11:24.300- 11:31.340* :  drone strike hit, killing a number of people. And then about 13 minutes into that, the people that
*11:31.340- 11:36.140* :  survived, said they tried to, you know, recover the bodies that they saw. Some mangled bodies were
*11:36.140- 11:41.420* :  hanging from rooftops, from trees. So they rushed into pack the bodies up, and then another
*11:41.420- 11:47.140* :  drone strike hit killing more people. And that is why the casual team, according to rights group,
*11:47.520- 11:51.940* :  would be higher than 85. There are no official figures yet. How can that be an accident?
*11:52.480- 11:57.480* :  Well, that's the question, but it's not the first time this would happen. The 2017 to 2023,
*11:57.480- 12:03.160* :  about 425 civilians have died, women and children inclusive in accidental
*12:03.160- 12:08.200* :  aerates like this. And this happens because, you know, the North Western Nigeria and North
*12:08.200- 12:13.560* :  Eastern Nigeria are affected by terrorism, banditry, and other criminal actions like
*12:13.560- 12:19.520* :  kidnapping for ransom. So many of this bandits and terrorists are known to, you know, operate
*12:19.520- 12:24.340* :  deep inside the forest where they, you know, when the kidnap their victims, they go there and hide
*12:24.340- 12:28.840* :  them there. So it makes it more difficult for authorities or security operatives to rescue
*12:28.840- 12:34.860* :  such victims. So the Nigerian military, most of the time, usually resort to aerates, you know,
*12:34.860- 12:40.560* :  to route out this militants. And that's why this happens, often, but unfortunately for them,
*12:40.880- 12:45.760* :  there are civilian casualties involved most of the time. So this is not the first time.
*12:46.540- 12:53.320* :  As is that, allow Lua in Lagos. The British Home Secretary James Cleverley has been in the
*12:53.320- 12:58.680* :  Rwandaan Capital, Kigali, to sign a new agreement to deport asylum seekers to the Central
*12:58.680- 13:04.100* :  African country. It's the third time a British Home Secretary has visited in the past two years,
*13:04.400- 13:10.380* :  and yet no one has been deported to Rwanda. The new agreement is a response to the UK Supreme
*13:10.380- 13:15.680* :  Court ruling last month that the government's plans were illegal. My any Jones is in Kigali.
*13:16.440- 13:22.160* :  It's an ordinary weekday here in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, a lot of people going about their
*13:22.160- 13:28.780* :  work. As we arrived earlier, we saw dozens of foreign visitors coming to the country for the many
*13:28.780- 13:33.460* :  conferences that it hosts. And that is the image that the Rwandan government wants to send out
*13:33.460- 13:38.880* :  to the world, that of a modern, vibrant African nation, one of the continent's fastest growing
*13:38.880- 13:44.380* :  economies. But the country's critics say that human rights here are not being respected,
*13:44.380- 13:49.320* :  freedom of expression is often curbed, and that arbitrary detentions are commonplace.
*13:49.940- 13:54.520* :  There's also been criticism from the opposition that says that the country cannot afford to
*13:54.520- 13:59.680* :  take in asylum seekers from the UK, that it's still a developing nation that should be focusing
*13:59.680- 14:05.220* :  on its own. And it totally were told that the reaction among many Rwandans is mixed.
*14:05.220- 14:10.660* :  Some of them are indifferent to this treaty with the UK government. Others are in favor of it,
*14:10.820- 14:15.180* :  thinking that the country should open its arms to foreign visitors. And then there are those who
*14:15.180- 14:20.480* :  believe that Rwanda is already too full and should focus on its own people before opening its doors
*14:20.480- 14:28.580* :  out to others. Mahini Jones. China may well find it both more expensive and more difficult to borrow
*14:28.580- 14:34.400* :  money after the Western Credit Agency Moodies gave it a negative outlook, meaning it believes its
*14:34.400- 14:39.760* :  creditworthiness is getting worse. The reason is the boom and bust in its property sector,
*14:39.760- 14:44.840* :  where tumbling prices mean developers are at risk of going bankrupt without finishing projects.
*14:44.840- 14:52.160* :  Nick Marsh has spent the night on a $100 billion Chinese project in Malaysia, which was supposed by
*14:52.160- 14:58.980* :  now to be home to a million people. Eight years after it started, it's still only 1% occupied.
*15:03.200- 15:09.360* :  I'm on the tip of Malaysia, driving south towards the coast. And there's something strange in the
*15:09.360- 15:17.280* :  distance. A dozen tower blocks on the horizon. Locals call it ghost city. And on first impressions,
*15:17.400- 15:29.020* :  it's hard to believe that anyone actually lives here. Okay, this is Forest City. It's a bit dark.
*15:30.420- 15:36.480* :  I think someone's forgotten to turn the lights on. Oh, here they are. Even in mid-afternoon,
*15:36.480- 15:42.600* :  the long corridors in the towers are pitch dark. It feels more like a haunted house than a happy
*15:42.600- 15:48.920* :  home. It's a reminder that you don't have to be in China to feel the effects of its property crisis.
*15:49.460- 15:55.500* :  No, it's not going to be long-term. Definitely. Finding residents was a struggle, but eventually I met
*15:55.500- 16:00.900* :  Joanne Kour. She moved here from northern Malaysia and has been renting for the past four months.
*16:01.320- 16:06.700* :  Do you feel like it's a good time? From what I've seen so far, yes. I would have to agree.
*16:07.280- 16:11.080* :  Yeah, maybe you should try after 12. Take a stroll.
*16:18.160- 16:23.700* :  Forest City was a chance for people in China's aspirational middle class to invest in a second
*16:23.700- 16:29.080* :  home abroad, which they could then rent out to locals here. But the company behind the project,
*16:29.080- 16:33.980* :  Country Garden, is facing debts of nearly $200 billion.
*16:39.040- 16:44.940* :  It's one of many Chinese developers in deep trouble. A couple of years ago, the government in China
*16:44.940- 16:49.840* :  became alarmed at the sheer amount of money that property companies were borrowing,
*16:50.460- 16:53.920* :  so it imposed strict rules to limit speculation.
*16:56.920- 17:04.020* :  Now with cash drying up, Forest City is a surreal place. It's like visiting an abandoned holiday resort.
*17:06.900- 17:10.280* :  So I'm in the shopping mall now, half of it's still basically just the building site.
*17:11.140- 17:17.780* :  But in front of me, there's a kids train, no one on it, and the driver is just doing endless loops
*17:17.780- 17:22.400* :  around the mall. If lonely around here, you're on your own.
*17:22.880- 17:27.000* :  This is Nazmi Hanathia. He used to live in Forest City, but after six months,
*17:27.000- 17:32.880* :  he decided to cut his losses and get out. He didn't even mind losing his rental deposit.
*17:33.340- 17:39.000* :  It's a multi-billion project. It's supposed to be good. It's supposed to make expectation,
*17:39.060- 17:45.600* :  but it's frustrating. It's frustrating for Nazmi, but it's alarming if you've actually bought a place
*17:45.600- 17:51.560* :  here. Buyers in China were reluctant to talk to the BBC even anonymously, but you can find
*17:51.560- 17:58.040* :  comments on Chinese social media asking how to get a refund from the ghost city. One said,
*17:58.500- 18:01.040* :  the prices drop so much, I'm speechless.
*18:05.080- 18:10.060* :  There's a storm brewing in China's property sector right now, and it's causing a headache
*18:10.060- 18:14.780* :  for the Chinese government. Many millions in China have invested their life savings
*18:14.780- 18:21.420* :  into projects just like this, and they'll be wanting some reassurance sooner, rather than later.

*18:36.700- 18:40.660* :  assisted driving technology isn't safe enough to be used on the road.
*18:40.960- 18:44.500* :  Even if you don't have a Tesla, your children still walk in the footpath.
*18:44.780- 18:50.180* :  They hit this terrifying feeling that one day a car might just harm them.

*20:11.240- 20:14.860* :  safe and situations. Thousands of people who have taken to the streets of New Zealand to join
*20:14.860- 20:20.280* :  peaceful protests and demonstrations against the new coalition government on the opening day of
*20:20.280- 20:25.840* :  Parliament. Marry leaders say the new government wants to limit Maori rights. Elsewhere in Parliament,
*20:25.840- 20:30.820* :  some Maori MPs deviated from the traditional oath of allegiance to King Charles,
*20:30.820- 20:36.680* :  sparking a debate on whether the wording was offensive. I asked the BBC's Phil Mercer,
*20:36.680- 20:43.620* :  what sparked the protests? These protests, Alex, attracted thousands of people. There was a noisy
*20:43.620- 20:49.940* :  rally outside a building called the Beehive, which is the New Zealand Parliament in the capital
*20:49.940- 20:57.080* :  Wellington. Their protesters say that the new Conservative coalition government has a racist
*20:57.080- 21:03.760* :  agenda against indigenous rights with plans to wind back policies that acknowledge
*21:03.820- 21:10.060* :  Maori as New Zealand's first inhabitants, and also to limit the use of Maori languages,
*21:10.740- 21:18.720* :  and also to scrap a dedicated indigenous health authority. So all of this has led to a big division
*21:18.720- 21:26.220* :  between Maori people and the incoming Conservative coalition government. We've seen some pretty
*21:26.220- 21:32.380* :  noisy demonstrations, and these protesters say that this is just the start, that there could
*21:32.380- 21:39.000* :  well be more protests pretty soon, and certainly there will be more they say in the coming weeks and
*21:39.000- 21:45.420* :  months. Phil Mercer, the protests are an early leadership test for the Prime Minister Christopher
*21:45.420- 21:51.280* :  Luxon, who said the government would work for all New Zealanders. The co-leader of the political
*21:51.280- 21:58.100* :  party to Patti Māori, which organised the protests, is Debbie Naroa-Paka. She spoke to my colleague
*21:58.100- 22:04.620* :  Rob Young. What was really exciting about today is that we had just as many non-Māori as we had
*22:04.620- 22:10.720* :  Māori supporting the pushback that we don't want to go backwards. We don't want to go back to
*22:10.720- 22:16.380* :  60 years where it's okay to smoke so that we have tax cuts for the rich. We don't want to go back
*22:16.540- 22:22.360* :  to a stage where our indigenous lounges relegated or hidden and not allowed to be used. We don't
*22:22.380- 22:27.540* :  want to go back to a period where castoration is the best way to deal with justice and prison
*22:27.540- 22:35.060* :  our way through to justice. We actually want to grow and be a prospering, you know, partnering.
*22:35.280- 22:39.360* :  Do you have some ideological beef with the government as well as some of the specific Māori
*22:39.360- 22:43.000* :  issues that we've been talking about? Do you regard this government as anti-Māori?
*22:43.920- 22:51.780* :  Yes, and it's not my personal view, it's backed by stats, it's backed by the anti-smoking,
*22:51.780- 22:56.020* :  they want to undo a Māori health authority, which address Māori health inequities,
*22:56.560- 23:02.580* :  and yet they want to increase smoking, which kills Māori three times more than anyone else.
*23:02.900- 23:06.980* :  So yes, the platform is very much an anti-Māori policy platform.
*23:07.340- 23:12.460* :  But you accept that you just can't change what the coalition government agreed just weeks ago.
*23:13.780- 23:19.540* :  I don't, I think if we accept that, then we're accepting racism, we're accepting discrimination
*23:19.540- 23:26.440* :  of indigenous peoples, and that is something that I don't think we should ever normalise and accept.
*23:26.840- 23:31.160* :  That may be their promises, that they have to keep in a political sense,
*23:31.580- 23:35.460* :  but I don't think any indigenous peoples across the world would accept that rhetoric.
*23:36.640- 23:42.220* :  Debbie Naroa-Paka from the Tsipati Māori political party in New Zealand.
*23:43.300- 23:47.480* :  A former Tesla technician has claimed that the company's assisted driving technology
*23:47.480- 23:49.920* :  isn't safe enough to be used on the road.
*23:49.920- 23:55.000* :  The electric carmaker says autopilot enhances safety and comfort behind the wheel.
*23:55.500- 23:59.800* :  But Lukas Krupski, who's in the UK receiving a whistle-blowing award,
*24:00.200- 24:04.960* :  has leaked data to US regulators and the German press raising safety concerns.
*24:06.040- 24:09.920* :  I don't think the hardware is ready, and the software is ready,
*24:10.780- 24:12.480* :  essentially, experiments in public roads.
*24:12.820- 24:16.740* :  So even if you don't have a Tesla, your children still walk in the footpath.
*24:17.800- 24:25.480* :  I hear this terrifying feeling that one day a car might just harm them.
*24:26.260- 24:28.220* :  Tesla hasn't commented on the claims.
*24:28.680- 24:32.880* :  Our technology editor, Zoe Kleinman, has been looking at what's being asserted.
*24:33.500- 24:38.200* :  Lukas Krupski worked for Tesla in Norway, and he has an interesting story.
*24:38.200- 24:41.420* :  He was a hero at first. He put out a fire in a delivery sensor.
*24:41.460- 24:44.440* :  He got an email from Elon Musk thanking him personally.
*24:44.820- 24:48.700* :  And there are two exchange some correspondence in which he highlighted what he claimed
*24:48.700- 24:50.000* :  were some safety concerns.
*24:50.280- 24:53.900* :  And at that point he says his managers turned against him,
*24:53.900- 24:56.840* :  and he had a very, very difficult time at work.
*24:57.260- 25:01.560* :  And then he found that he could access a lot of company information,
*25:01.560- 25:04.300* :  very personal data, including details of employers,
*25:04.480- 25:07.200* :  but also lots of correspondence about safety concerns.
*25:07.200- 25:08.380* :  He says about the cars.
*25:08.780- 25:11.860* :  And some of the things he claims he saw really alarmed him.
*25:11.940- 25:14.100* :  So for example, and we have heard about it.
*25:14.100- 25:15.960* :  There's an issue with automated cars.
*25:16.760- 25:18.220* :  Phantom braking is what they call it.
*25:18.220- 25:19.760* :  So it's when they brake when they shouldn't.
*25:19.760- 25:23.080* :  The sensors pick something up that isn't there, or they misinterpret it.
*25:23.380- 25:24.480* :  And they slam the brakes on.
*25:24.480- 25:26.460* :  He said there was a lot of correspondence about that.
*25:26.500- 25:28.240* :  A lot more than he expected to see.
*25:28.740- 25:33.440* :  And he also says he believes that the technology that's been built isn't really ready,
*25:33.440- 25:36.140* :  and shouldn't be deployed on the roads.
*25:36.160- 25:38.540* :  Now, what he did with that data is controversial,
*25:38.540- 25:41.220* :  because he handed it over to the US regulators,
*25:41.800- 25:43.920* :  and also to the German newspaper,
*25:44.440- 25:47.400* :  and the Dutch data authority is currently investigating
*25:47.400- 25:49.200* :  whether that was a data breach.
*25:49.200- 25:52.100* :  But he says he did it because he felt so strongly
*25:52.100- 25:54.260* :  that people needed to know what was going on,
*25:54.260- 25:56.480* :  and that he wasn't getting anywhere internally with Tesla.
*25:56.620- 25:57.600* :  And what did Tesla say?
*25:58.180- 26:00.860* :  Well, Tesla did not respond to any of our emails,
*26:00.860- 26:04.560* :  but they do release some safety information.
*26:04.820- 26:08.020* :  The last lot of figures they released was at the end of 2022.
*26:08.020- 26:12.480* :  And they said that on average, people driving Tesla's
*26:12.480- 26:15.060* :  and using this autopilot assisted drive feature
*26:15.440- 26:17.720* :  are having a crash where the airbag is deployed
*26:17.720- 26:21.100* :  roughly once every five million miles driven.
*26:21.600- 26:24.940* :  And Tesla drivers not using autopilot are having a crash
*26:25.320- 26:28.560* :  with the airbag roughly once everyone in a half million miles.
*26:29.000- 26:31.360* :  And that compares Tesla's says with the national average
*26:31.360- 26:33.520* :  of all drivers having that kind of accident
*26:33.520- 26:35.500* :  once every 600,000 miles,
*26:35.660- 26:37.120* :  but just in its worth pointing out
*26:37.120- 26:39.400* :  that we can't independently verify those figures
*26:39.400- 26:41.320* :  because they've come directly from Tesla itself.
*26:42.280- 26:46.120* :  So, Eclineman, as the war in Gaza continues,
*26:46.120- 26:48.720* :  there's also been a rise in violence in the West Bank,
*26:48.720- 26:51.640* :  the other Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.
*26:52.000- 26:54.760* :  Allies of Israel have condemned a sharp rise in attacks
*26:54.760- 26:57.460* :  on Palestinian civilians by armed Israelis
*26:57.460- 26:58.400* :  who've settled there.
*26:58.720- 27:00.720* :  These settlements are seen by most countries
*27:00.720- 27:02.620* :  as a violation of international law.
*27:03.120- 27:05.560* :  According to a Palestinian government tally,
*27:05.560- 27:08.800* :  more than 250 Palestinians have been killed
*27:08.800- 27:12.040* :  by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank
*27:12.040- 27:14.680* :  since Hamas's attack on October the 7th.
*27:15.080- 27:17.960* :  Religious Jews believe the land was given to them by God
*27:18.380- 27:21.200* :  and the leaders of the settlers say they're protecting themselves
*27:21.200- 27:24.580* :  from the West Bank Jeremy Bowen sent this report.
*27:25.880- 27:28.760* :  Whether Judean desert tumbles down to the river Jordan
*27:29.300- 27:32.160* :  lies a tiny community of Palestinian Bedouins,
*27:32.740- 27:36.520* :  it's called Arab Il Mlihat, and it looks timeless.
*27:38.120- 27:40.580* :  The village, really just a family compound,
*27:40.620- 27:44.800* :  lies a few minutes from an illegal outpost of Jewish settlers
*27:45.520- 27:47.540* :  who came calling a few nights ago.
*27:50.800- 27:54.140* :  Montezard, 23-year-old son of one of eight brothers here,
*27:54.820- 27:55.900* :  videoed what happened.
*28:00.600- 28:02.760* :  The settlers accused them falsely the family
*28:02.760- 28:04.320* :  said of stealing their goats.
*28:05.120- 28:08.500* :  One, wearing a police jacket loaded his assault rifle.
*28:09.520- 28:10.920* :  They thought they were about to die.
*28:13.800- 28:15.080* :  He was shooting at my uncle,
*28:15.080- 28:17.780* :  so I ran down there and confronted him.
*28:18.360- 28:21.740* :  We were pushing each other and screaming, head to head.
*28:22.280- 28:24.200* :  Then, around 20 settlers came.
*28:25.580- 28:28.480* :  Now they said they had to trust God as Israel's police
*28:28.480- 28:30.080* :  and army protect the settlers.
*28:31.120- 28:35.000* :  Before Gaza, two or three settlers with pistols might steal sheep.
*28:35.520- 28:38.120* :  Now it was more than 20 with assault rifles.
*28:39.080- 28:40.980* :  The settlers want to force them out,
*28:41.020- 28:46.240* :  and this family believes the Israeli government has given them the weapons to do it.
*28:47.520- 28:50.280* :  In three days of traveling through the occupied West Bank,
*28:50.820- 28:54.360* :  Palestinians have said consistently that since the war in Gaza,
*28:54.360- 28:57.180* :  Jewish settlers are better armed and much more aggressive.
*28:57.640- 29:01.060* :  At Susia, south of Hebron, soldiers checked us out.
*29:01.360- 29:04.740* :  They filmed us, but took much less interest in what had happened,
*29:04.740- 29:06.680* :  a few miles down the road.
*29:07.340- 29:10.280* :  The village of Kilpid Zanuta had been bulldozed,
*29:10.460- 29:11.760* :  activist said last night.
*29:12.740- 29:16.360* :  Zanuta's 200 Palestinians left four weeks ago
*29:16.900- 29:19.780* :  after a barrage of threats from armed Jewish settlers.
*29:21.640- 29:23.980* :  Someone drew Jewish stars of David.
*29:25.200- 29:27.460* :  A settler leader canceled an interview.
*29:27.800- 29:30.480* :  The police said they were waiting for a complaint.
*29:31.040- 29:35.200* :  In fact, Zanuta's Palestinians have petitioned Israel's supreme court.
*29:36.440- 29:39.860* :  We went to the village with a former Israeli special forces soldier
*29:40.360- 29:42.500* :  who now campaigns against the occupation.
*29:42.800- 29:44.200* :  They are demolishing Palestinian villages,
*29:44.200- 29:47.140* :  beating up Palestinian farmers, stealing their olives.
*29:47.660- 29:50.880* :  They are trying to open a third front and east front against the Palestinians.
*29:50.880- 29:52.420* :  Why? The Palestinian West Bank?
*29:52.420- 29:55.440* :  Why? Because they wanted to land without Palestinians.
*29:56.060- 30:01.300* :  Palestinians see all this and the rest of the settler violence on the West Bank
*30:02.400- 30:05.720* :  as confirmation of their worst fears,
*30:06.520- 30:10.560* :  that there are powerful elements inside Israel in the government as well as the settler movement
*30:11.440- 30:17.060* :  who want them out and who are using the enormous crisis surrounding the Gaza
*30:17.060- 30:21.160* :  War as an opportunity to further their agenda.
*30:22.800- 30:25.640* :  Jeremy Bowen in the West Bank. And now.
*30:30.420- 30:34.060* :  You see her? Do you know why you're here? Bad luck, I guess.
*30:35.900- 30:39.780* :  Part of the trailer for the sixth installment of Grand Theft Auto,
*30:39.780- 30:43.380* :  which has been released early after it leaked online the game,
*30:44.060- 30:48.140* :  which is due in 2025, will feature the first female lead character,
*30:48.140- 30:53.720* :  Lucia, in the series. Asia Business Reporter Monica Miller has been taking a look.
*30:54.200- 30:59.800* :  This leak came 15 hours early than expected, but nevertheless they decided to go for it.
*31:00.040- 31:04.380* :  I'm just looking on YouTube and it already has 6.3 million views.
*31:04.640- 31:06.660* :  And again, we're just talking about the trailer.
*31:06.660- 31:09.840* :  We're not talking about the game, which you're going to have to wait until 2025.
*31:10.060- 31:13.220* :  It is just a staggering how successful this is.
*31:13.340- 31:18.920* :  This will be the sequel to the smash hit GTA 5, which was released in 2013,
*31:18.920- 31:23.060* :  which became the second best-selling video game of all time behind Minecraft.
*31:23.060- 31:27.560* :  I mean, we're looking at numbers around 190 million copies worldwide.
*31:28.160- 31:32.180* :  And the trailer confirms many of these details that people had been already expecting.
*31:32.780- 31:37.920* :  We are seeing that the female protagonist, she goes on a crime spree through crowded beaches,
*31:37.920- 31:42.220* :  city highways and clubs with her partner in a Bonnie and Clyde scenario.
*31:42.220- 31:46.160* :  I mean, several analysts are saying that this is a sure instant win.
*31:46.160- 31:48.460* :  It's going to make billions of dollars in sales.
*31:48.460- 31:52.320* :  And Rockstar has also separately made an announcement that with Netflix,
*31:52.320- 31:55.920* :  it will bring several of its titles as part of its gaming offering.
*31:55.920- 32:02.340* :  That includes GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas will be made available to Netflix subscribers
*32:02.340- 32:05.680* :  on mobile devices starting on the 14th of December.
*32:06.060- 32:06.640* :  Monica Miller.
*32:09.020- 32:11.340* :  And that's all from us for now.
*32:11.340- 32:14.820* :  But there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
