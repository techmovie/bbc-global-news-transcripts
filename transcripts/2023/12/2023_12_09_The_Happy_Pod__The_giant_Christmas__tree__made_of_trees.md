*01:16.440- 01:21.620* :  This week in Italy, what's known as the world's largest Christmas tree that isn't technically a tree
*01:22.020- 01:29.400* :  is unveiled? Hello, I'm Harry Bley, and in this edition,
*01:29.400- 01:34.640* :  hear the story of Katie Taylor, the Irish boxing champion fighting from an early age.
*01:35.040- 01:40.080* :  Girls weren't allowed the box, so she would get dressed in a dad's car. She'd put a head guard on,
*01:40.540- 01:43.740* :  she'd put a gown on with a hood, and she'd walk to the ring.
*01:44.460- 01:47.760* :  The clinic in Borneo, helping to reduce deforestation.
*01:48.560- 01:54.180* :  It's really closer to being a small hospital. If we do inpatient care, we have until very recently
*01:54.180- 02:01.200* :  been doing 24-hour emergency care as well. And you would say, oh, he's got real raise.
*02:02.500- 02:06.500* :  Susie Dent joins us to discuss this year's Oxford Word of the Year.
*02:07.120- 02:12.260* :  Hi, I'm Susie Dent, and I am going to be attempting to raise up the happy put.
*02:12.980- 02:16.720* :  That's right, this is the happy putt from the BBC World Service.
*02:22.420- 02:27.680* :  For one whole month from December the 7th, the Italian town of Gubio displays the world's
*02:27.680- 02:33.500* :  largest Christmas tree. Although it's not just one massive tree, it's a Christmas tree shape
*02:33.540- 02:40.240* :  made from lighting up trees on the slope of Mount Injuno. This was the moment the lights were switched on.
*02:48.200- 02:53.020* :  The tree is an impressive sight. Drone footage taken from above the town shows the very
*02:53.020- 02:58.540* :  recognizable outline of a classic Christmas tree made from green lights. In the middle there are
*02:58.540- 03:04.500* :  dozens of red, yellow and blue lit trees that represent baubles, and at the top the star
*03:04.740- 03:09.460* :  positioned on a hilltop Catholic church, the Basilica of Santa Ubaldo.
*03:10.280- 03:15.160* :  Lights continue down, representing the tree's stump, with lights weaving into the walls of the
*03:15.160- 03:20.760* :  town at the bottom of the hill. The Christmas tree can be seen from ground level two as it lights
*03:20.760- 03:28.760* :  up the hillside. It's set to have taken around 1300 hours or 54 days to make it. The man in charge
*03:28.760- 03:36.980* :  of that is Jackamo Fumanti, the president of the Christmas tree committee. This year we started
*03:36.980- 03:42.060* :  work on September the 10th and finished on the last Sunday of November. Every Sunday morning
*03:42.060- 03:49.020* :  we were on the hill working. Our association has 63 members and on average 30 to 35 of us were
*03:49.020- 03:54.820* :  on the Mount working on Sunday mornings. This tree entered the Guinness Book of World Records back
*03:54.820- 04:03.000* :  in 1991. It had a base of 450 meters and a height of 750 meters. We placed a comet star with a
*04:03.000- 04:13.740* :  surface area of a thousand square meters on the top of the hill. The sound of carol singers with
*04:13.740- 04:19.040* :  jingle bells marking the lighting of the Christmas tree and you can go back and watch the entire
*04:19.040- 04:24.040* :  ceremony and see the tree for yourself on the town's Facebook page where it was live streamed.
*04:25.780- 04:29.240* :  We'll be talking about more trees later on in the podcast but for now,
*04:29.240- 04:36.200* :  do you have riz? It's a word that's used a lot on the internet, slang for romantic appeal or charm
*04:36.200- 04:43.340* :  and this week it became the Oxford dictionaries word of 2023. Suzy Dent is a lexicographer and
*04:43.340- 04:48.600* :  etymologist and author. In September she came on the podcast and told us all about her book
*04:48.600- 04:55.000* :  on happy words called Roots of Happiness. I'm just looking at the page for Lagom which is
*04:55.000- 05:01.640* :  Swedish and that's just gorgeous. It essentially means not too much, not too little but just right
*05:01.640- 05:07.240* :  which I think is gorgeous and lots and lots of words from other languages that we haven't yet managed
*05:07.240- 05:13.100* :  to translate. One that I absolutely love is the Japanese again it's another sort of aesthetic
*05:13.100- 05:19.740* :  really. It's Sibui which is all about unobtrusive beauty so it's a face that's wrinkled through
*05:19.740- 05:26.460* :  smiles. It's just such a lovely idea and then a lot of cultures also have words for being alone
*05:26.460- 05:32.700* :  in a wood and feeling the power of the trees and the the beauty of the solitude. So German have
*05:32.700- 05:39.600* :  vulgar and zanthite but they are just not rendered in English so I think we have to go then to the
*05:39.600- 05:46.480* :  original. So who better to ask about riz? I spoke to Suzy and began asking what exactly riz means?
*05:47.400- 05:51.920* :  The definition, you do not, it may change. I mean that's a really interesting thing about this
*05:51.960- 05:56.660* :  word. You can tell it's a word on the move and you can tell it's a word that is embedding itself
*05:56.660- 06:00.560* :  in their language because it's being used in different ways. It's being used as a verb. If you
*06:00.560- 06:06.260* :  rid someone up, you are attracting or seducing them or chasing them up. You would say, oh he's
*06:06.260- 06:11.940* :  got real riz. It's being used as part of the expression unspoken riz which is what we all want.
*06:12.380- 06:19.820* :  A kind of, you know, unspoken riz that is effortless really and then you have
*06:19.820- 06:25.840* :  riz coloured glasses. I think it was another one whereby people on dating websites were prioritising
*06:25.840- 06:32.060* :  riz over other aspects of people's personality. So it's definitely being rift off if you like
*06:32.060- 06:38.520* :  or rift on and as I say that shows that a word is really taking off. The Oxford word of the year.
*06:38.760- 06:44.420* :  Susie, tell me how is this chosen? It was very interesting this time Harry because normally
*06:45.260- 06:51.560* :  the Oxford word of the year is chosen by a group of lexicographers who study empirical data which
*06:51.560- 06:56.900* :  involves billions of words of current language in these databases which show which words are bubbling
*06:56.900- 07:03.020* :  under which words are fading away and they study those and then they make a selection and ultimately
*07:03.100- 07:10.180* :  the final decision is inevitably a little bit subjective and last year and now this year,
*07:10.180- 07:15.760* :  what they've done is they allowed the public to vote on various contenders which they chose
*07:15.760- 07:21.680* :  from a short list based on that data and the public then voted and the lexicographers then
*07:21.680- 07:26.920* :  in turn looked at the votes, looked again at the data and made a decision. So it's a really
*07:26.920- 07:30.620* :  interesting way of doing it and I think much more reflective of the way that English actually
*07:30.620- 07:35.620* :  evolves which is by democracy. There is no authority saying this is the correct way to use this
*07:35.660- 07:41.100* :  word or you cannot use this other word and so to actually allow the people who are generating
*07:41.180- 07:46.160* :  the popularity of these words to have a say I think was really wonderful and it's quite unique.
*07:46.960- 07:54.060* :  This word riz very much comes from the internet as does last year's Oxford word goblin mode which
*07:54.220- 07:58.400* :  I actually haven't heard for a long time. We had a good laugh about this earlier because it's
*07:58.400- 08:05.080* :  such a weird concept of goblin mode. Yes but it was kind of it was unself conscious
*08:05.840- 08:09.900* :  scruffiness wasn't it? It was just letting it all hang out really and I think it was a hangover
*08:09.900- 08:14.460* :  probably from the pandemic but what was quite interesting this year I think is that on the short
*08:14.460- 08:20.220* :  list were other words not just from the online communities but also from dating so there was a
*08:20.220- 08:25.300* :  situation ship that was another word on the list which is a relationship that isn't quite defined
*08:25.300- 08:32.400* :  or committed yet and there was also a beige flag which was a new one on me but I was
*08:32.400- 08:37.280* :  getting one under 30 then exactly what you're talking about and a beige flag I think this is
*08:37.880- 08:43.100* :  something that is not quite a red flag it's neither one thing nor another in terms of a
*08:43.240- 08:49.060* :  signal within a relationship but it's something possibly quite quirky about someone who you are
*08:49.060- 08:55.580* :  dating and you're not quite sure where it sits. And finally Susie do you think the best word one?
*08:56.820- 09:03.800* :  I think actually if you look at the percentages I think Swiftie was right up there as well and I
*09:03.800- 09:09.460* :  think all of us heard of Swifties this year with Taylor Swift's tour it's a definition for a really
*09:09.460- 09:17.680* :  big Taylor Swift fan but in the end yes I think Riz is a really good choice for so many reasons as
*09:17.680- 09:22.900* :  I say it's a wonderful example of how language evolves given that it's on the move and how we
*09:23.680- 09:28.900* :  how we use it and also it's a really good example of how online spaces are really shaping our
*09:28.900- 09:32.300* :  language at the moment so I think for all those reasons it was an excellent choice.
*09:33.600- 09:39.700* :  The Rizful Susie Dent. Back in May the Irish Boxer Katie Taylor was widely tipped to beat her
*09:39.700- 09:45.540* :  English opponent Shantelle Cameron in a highly anticipated fight. She hadn't lost since the 2016
*09:45.540- 09:51.420* :  Olympics and was the undisputed lightweight champion but she was defeated on a majority decision
*09:51.420- 09:57.720* :  failing to deliver the dream for her supporters. Six months later at the end of November the wind
*09:57.720- 10:04.600* :  changed it was described as an epic rematch and this time Taylor came on top. This win means a lot
*10:04.600- 10:11.220* :  for Katie Taylor and women's boxing in Ireland and beyond. I spoke to boxing commentator Steve Bunts
*10:11.520- 10:15.300* :  about in Katie Taylor's own words the greatest night of her career.
*10:16.120- 10:22.000* :  Taylor started boxing when she was about six or seven. When she first fought as a child amateur
*10:22.000- 10:27.460* :  eleven years of age that's the legal age. She had to get dressed in a dad's car and the reason for
*10:27.460- 10:32.700* :  that is simple. Girls weren't allowed the box so she would get dressed in a dad's car. She'd
*10:32.700- 10:38.360* :  put her head guard on. She'd put a gown on with a hood and she'd walk to the ring and of course
*10:38.360- 10:41.860* :  she was eleven years of age. It's hard to tell a difference between a 11 year old boy and a
*10:41.860- 10:46.420* :  11 year old girl and she'd fight and it was only when she got to about 12 or 13 that people
*10:46.420- 10:53.080* :  realised that Katie Taylor was actually Katie Taylor and not Katie Taylor so she at that point
*10:53.120- 10:57.880* :  and that was close to girls and women being allowed to box officially all around the world.
*10:57.880- 11:02.180* :  That's all around the globe at that point but when she started she had to get changed in a
*11:02.340- 11:06.800* :  dad's car. An old junky van as she called it and that's where she used to put her head guard on
*11:06.800- 11:12.460* :  and disguise herself as Kay Dot Taylor and of course Taylor was born in a country in Ireland where
*11:12.460- 11:18.720* :  it was illegal for her to box and she's gone on to the fighting the Olympics as well so she's
*11:18.720- 11:22.300* :  quite a pioneer isn't she? She's slightly more than a pioneer really I mean because
*11:22.940- 11:26.440* :  anywhere you're going a world where there's an amateur tournament and I've been to them in about
*11:26.440- 11:33.100* :  a dozen different places either Olympics or major world events. Katie Taylor is the pin-up you know
*11:33.100- 11:39.120* :  so when you are in Brazil there are 12 year old girls in boxing gyms with pictures of Katie Taylor
*11:39.800- 11:45.060* :  taped to their backpacks the school backpacks I've been I saw that in 2016 when I went to Brazil
*11:45.060- 11:51.320* :  for the Olympics she's a brand name it's just Katie Taylor women's boxing is Katie Taylor even
*11:51.320- 11:55.500* :  the women that fight her and make a million dollars for fighting even the women that beat her
*11:55.800- 11:59.660* :  and the women who are her absolute enemies are mad rivals they still look
*11:59.660- 12:03.840* :  at knowledge if you pin them down that the reason they have boxing is because of Katie Taylor
*12:03.840- 12:08.500* :  she was the woman you had pinned up you know in your bedroom at home when you were growing up and
*12:08.500- 12:13.820* :  that's the influence of Katie Taylor but what she does in Ireland is she's stepped away from boxing
*12:14.420- 12:20.940* :  so she's massive on various issues to do with women in Ireland and here I doesn't quite
*12:20.940- 12:26.480* :  cover it and pioneer doesn't quite cover you need to be with Katie Taylor you need to see the
*12:26.480- 12:30.560* :  look of awe in the young girls eyes you need to be there you need to see it you need to sense it
*12:30.620- 12:35.680* :  then you get a sense of what it really is and six months ago she lost to Shantel Cameron six
*12:35.680- 12:41.840* :  months later she won can you describe that moment for us I don't know if I can the original defeat
*12:41.840- 12:46.980* :  back in May was hard to take it was narrow but she lost it she took it brilliantly but she did
*12:46.980- 12:50.920* :  some things wrong that week she was loved and adored she did too much he gave too much for the
*12:50.920- 12:55.700* :  public during the six days in Dublin this time she didn't for instance her ring walk in May
*12:55.700- 13:01.340* :  lasted 11 minutes her ring walk in the rematch we have Shantel Cameron in the same venue the ring
*13:01.340- 13:09.340* :  walked lasted 22 seconds she meant business and the crowd on the night in Dublin when she got revenge
*13:09.340- 13:14.820* :  over Shantel Cameron in a foul field and just quite gripping fight some forget her
*13:15.640- 13:27.120* :  and the new undisputed super lightweight champion of the world Katie Taylor
*13:29.300- 13:31.220* :  boxing commentator Steve Bunts
*13:36.580- 13:42.960* :  coming up in this podcast it's an against all odds win especially for the manatees of course
*13:42.960- 13:48.040* :  they're very very very old so every day is a gift but now it truly is
*13:48.460- 13:53.040* :  Romeo was said to be the world's loneliest manatee but now he's found a friend
*14:02.340- 14:06.800* :  the global news podcast brings you the world's latest breaking news and development
*14:06.940- 14:13.480* :  but some stories need a little more time i'm Katya Adler host of the brand new BBC World

*14:33.480- 14:38.340* :  global story search for the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts
*14:40.240- 14:46.000* :  deforestation is a worldwide problem cutting down trees on mass has devastating impacts to wildlife
*14:46.000- 14:52.580* :  and the environment especially in a delicate and rich ecosystem like a rainforest but how do you
*14:52.580- 14:58.080* :  stop people chopping down trees in the Indonesian part of Borneo researchers for a conservation
*14:58.080- 15:03.160* :  charity discovered that local people were chopping down the rainforest around them for an incredibly
*15:03.160- 15:08.800* :  understandable reason they needed to pay for medical treatments for themselves and their children
*15:09.320- 15:13.600* :  now a medical clinic has been set up which offers a discount on medicines and treatments
*15:13.600- 15:19.760* :  for people who don't partake in logging myra anubi from the BBC's people fixing the world program
*15:19.760- 15:27.960* :  spoke to the woman behind this idea kenari web you know it was this amazing and beautiful and
*15:27.960- 15:33.700* :  exquisite thing to be in the rain for us but I could hear the chainsaws all around me that's
*15:33.700- 15:39.940* :  kenari web who happens to be both a medical doctor and an ecologist at the time she was on a student
*15:39.940- 15:46.080* :  trip to study orangutans and she didn't understand why the local people would want to destroy this
*15:46.080- 15:52.040* :  beautiful place that they called home the gunungpalung national park which is a large area of tropical
*15:52.040- 15:59.360* :  rainforest on the islands west coast and it just broke my heart and then I I talked to many of
*15:59.360- 16:06.520* :  these men and discovered that they were logging often crazily to pay for health care access
*16:07.320- 16:12.580* :  people were destroying their future in order to get their present and it was not only destroying
*16:12.580- 16:20.140* :  their own future but the future of the orangutans the future of our planet and so I really I
*16:20.140- 16:26.180* :  felt like we we just can't have we can't have a planet where this is happening and where people
*16:26.180- 16:31.820* :  have to make those kinds of horrible choices kenari went back to the US and finished medical school
*16:31.820- 16:38.260* :  before returning to bonyo and setting up a charity called alam sehat le starry or asri
*16:38.640- 16:45.060* :  along with her co-founder hotlin omposungu the aim was to preserve the forest and reduce illegal
*16:45.060- 16:50.700* :  logging so they started by sitting down with the local people to ask them what it would take for
*16:50.700- 16:56.600* :  them to stop cutting down the trees and protect the rainforest around them the asri team spent
*16:56.600- 17:02.740* :  around 400 hours talking with local people and over and over again people said that the one
*17:02.740- 17:09.120* :  thing they needed most was good quality affordable health care okay well we'll just you know
*17:09.560- 17:16.060* :  will we can't build your hospital right away although we did eventually but we will try our very
*17:16.060- 17:21.720* :  best to build a clinic and to provide services kenari and her team started building their clinic
*17:21.720- 17:29.220* :  and it opened back in 2007 however kenari knew that on its own the clinic might not be enough
*17:29.220- 17:34.960* :  of an incentive for people to stop cutting down the rainforest so together with community leaders
*17:34.960- 17:42.080* :  she came up with another big idea what if people could get a large discount on their medical care

*18:48.420- 18:54.780* :  mayami sequerium in florida but this week the 67 year old mammal was removed from his isolated
*18:54.780- 19:01.460* :  and crumbling enclosure and is now being cared for across the state at zoo tamper and as niki

*19:07.800- 19:15.260* :  weeks ago of romio the manatee floating alone in a small concrete pool at mayami sequerium it was
*19:15.260- 19:21.400* :  viewed more than 20 million times and tens of thousands of people joined a campaign to free him
*19:22.000- 19:26.660* :  the attraction had been given until mid-december to improve conditions or lose its license
*19:26.660- 19:33.040* :  but on Tuesday night the florida authorities announced that romio and two other manatees who
*19:33.040- 19:39.220* :  were being kept separately had been removed and taken to critical care centres elsewhere in florida
*19:39.900- 19:44.820* :  professor sythia springfield is the vet overseeing the care of romio and one of the other manatees
*19:45.140- 19:51.620* :  at zoo tamper she says despite their age and the trauma of a five hour journey by road both are
*19:51.620- 19:57.440* :  doing well they both made it through their transport just fine they're in pools right now with
*19:57.440- 20:03.120* :  other manatee that was a concern that romio was by himself and so we're able to get him with other
*20:03.120- 20:07.940* :  manatees immediately and he's swimming around investigating his new environment and hanging out
*20:07.940- 20:12.940* :  with with other animals so we're really really pleased with how good they look so far
*20:13.660- 20:17.320* :  as soon as the vets are happy romio will be moved to a more natural setting
*20:17.320- 20:22.800* :  he may always need human help but will live out his remaining days with other manatees

*20:28.680- 20:35.400* :  it's an against all odds win especially for the manatees of course they're very very very
*20:35.400- 20:40.320* :  old so every day is a gift but now it truly is now it can be said that their lives have improved
*20:40.320- 20:46.520* :  so much that even if only in the internment temporary is certainly was worth the risk he's now
*20:46.520- 20:53.460* :  able to explore and think and feel and that's the essence of life philip demurs from urgent seas
*20:53.460- 20:59.540* :  ending that report by niki cardwell this week we're remembering the writer and poet Benjamin

*21:11.680- 21:18.240* :  a news bulletin containing only happy and uplifting stories he felt it important to raise awareness
*21:18.240- 21:24.120* :  for the good news in the world when the news often seems bleak i think i just think there could be more
*21:24.120- 21:30.060* :  of it there could be more of it and i mean there is at a local level sometimes on local radio
*21:30.060- 21:34.680* :  and in local news you do hear these kind of good news stories i think the problem is that we've
*21:34.680- 21:41.900* :  actually just developed a culture of it over the years and so it feels odd now but there's no
*21:41.900- 21:47.420* :  reason why we can't have more it's probably good news is probably the wrong word positive news
*21:51.340- 21:55.840* :  the writer and poets Benjamin Zephaniah who died this week at the age of 65
*21:57.440- 22:02.380* :  a rendition of led zeppelin's stairway to heaven performed by school children in New Zealand

*22:38.240- 22:52.980* :  high note and he succeeded the rock anthem became the main event i spoke to Duncan and lead
*22:52.980- 22:59.220* :  electric guitarist Mia Fraser from their school the finale really did go up a little this year
*22:59.220- 23:04.020* :  because i know that we wanted to do a rock show and we our prize giving happens in what we call
*23:04.020- 23:07.500* :  the wolfbrock arena here so it's not an our school hall or anything like that because it wouldn't fit
*23:07.500- 23:11.980* :  the three and a half thousand people that come so we have this arena where you know any big groups
*23:11.980- 23:16.040* :  that are coming to town will play in and so i thought we have an opportunity to do a big rock arena
*23:16.040- 23:21.180* :  type show but i knew that as part of that we really had to bring it with the light show as well so
*23:21.640- 23:25.600* :  we have some really great lighting designers that help us with our school musicals and the guy
*23:25.600- 23:30.160* :  Sean Hawkins who did our lighting design i worked with him for a few months and said Sean i don't know
*23:30.160- 23:34.420* :  what i want but i want something epic what can we do with lights and so people together a really great
*23:34.420- 23:40.000* :  show and he ended up having 72 lighting cues in the five or six minutes and we even got all the
*23:40.000- 23:45.120* :  students into our school outdoor quad and moved people around and figured out what's it going to
*23:45.120- 23:49.720* :  look like if people stand there or stand there and we we play around with that one evening and then we
*23:49.720- 23:53.460* :  measured it all up and he went away and did the lighting show and sort of had it ready to go for us
*23:53.460- 23:57.980* :  on the day so really fortunate that we've just worked in such great professional people that
*23:58.240- 24:04.360* :  that made it look so astounding and stay away to heaven by Led Zeppelin a very well-known
*24:04.360- 24:09.640* :  rock song possibly the most well-known rock song of all time why why did you choose that piece
*24:10.700- 24:16.480* :  well i was suggested to me by former board chair of our board of governors and often i ignore those
*24:16.480- 24:19.740* :  sorts of emails from slightly older people that love to have good advice to me about what i
*24:19.740- 24:24.340* :  should do but luckily brine piece and came up with a really good link and it was to the the
*24:24.620- 24:29.900* :  heart performance of it as a tribute to Led Zeppelin as part of a i can't not say yes you should
*24:29.900- 24:34.460* :  what it was for actually a concert that Obama was hosting and it sort of hit me like i think our
*24:34.460- 24:38.480* :  videos hitting other people it was an emotional response and it was so uplifting and inspiring i
*24:38.480- 24:43.120* :  thought yeah that's it's an amazing piece and it's in it's the perfect timing for our year group
*24:43.740- 24:47.560* :  having students like Mia here who I knew could pull off that guitar solo because she's just such a
*24:47.820- 24:51.760* :  a great musician i thought yeah this is a there's a there's a perfect choice for us to do this year
*24:52.620- 24:56.880* :  i perhaps maybe naively thought that didn't think about the magnitude of the song and what a
*24:56.880- 25:01.840* :  risk it was because we never thought it was going to go obviously you know outside of our school
*25:01.840- 25:05.920* :  community that anyone else would ever see it so maybe it was quite good that i didn't sort of
*25:05.920- 25:11.140* :  realize what a big challenge it would be and at the time and yeah my naivety and that was probably
*25:11.140- 25:16.100* :  worked to our favor a little bit and let's talk about that guitar solo because Mia there's this
*25:16.100- 25:21.820* :  moment that you walk into the center of the stage and suddenly all the spotlights shine onto you
*25:21.820- 25:29.100* :  and you you perform that very very well-known iconic electric guitar solo originally by Jimmy Page
*25:40.760- 25:45.640* :  what was that moment like for you it was very nerve wrecking honestly i can't remember
*25:46.200- 25:51.160* :  too much of it apart from that it was pitch black was all i could see and i mean i guess i could hear
*25:51.160- 25:55.120* :  the crowd and it was very exciting i hadn't experienced anything like that before
*26:05.820- 26:12.140* :  so when the song ends it ends on this really lovely long note and then the sudden big big crash
*26:13.020- 26:20.200* :  and then the crowd erupts in applause was that an extra special applause given the magnitude of
*26:20.200- 26:25.660* :  the performance was it more than you'd expect or are all your school assemblies like that
*26:26.200- 26:32.760* :  well not to this scale like it was just a very extraordinary experience and just hearing the crowd
*26:33.260- 26:38.980* :  and feeling like on probably the last time i'd be with the school together um it was just a really
*26:38.980- 26:43.680* :  nice feeling yeah um but luckily we had so many parents send in footage to us from their iPhones
*26:43.680- 26:47.500* :  and things like that and we got to see what it was all like up in the rafters and at the back of
*26:47.500- 26:50.900* :  the auditorium how people were just cheering for me here as she came up it was just one of those
*26:50.900- 26:55.020* :  moments that you know make the hear stand up in the back of your neck and think oh well yeah that's
*26:55.020- 26:58.460* :  what that's why we do music that's why we want to feel those kinds of things and say
*26:58.800- 27:02.260* :  it was just a special moment and one i'll certainly remember for my career as well i think
*27:10.600- 27:15.680* :  music teacher Duncan Ferguson and guitarist Mia Fraser from Cent Andrews College in
*27:15.680- 27:19.720* :  Christchurch on their spectacular edition of a rock classic
