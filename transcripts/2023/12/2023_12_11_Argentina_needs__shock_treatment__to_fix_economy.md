*01:42.980- 01:45.440* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:48.060- 01:52.340* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Monday 11 December, these are our main stories.
*01:52.340- 01:56.840* :  At his swearing in ceremony, the new president of Argentina, Javier Millet,
*01:57.080- 02:01.320* :  has said the country needs shock treatment to bring it out of its economic crisis.
*02:02.020- 02:06.900* :  The World Health Organization has adopted a resolution calling for immediate medical access
*02:07.360- 02:12.560* :  and humanitarian aid for Gaza. The International Committee of the Red Cross says one of its
*02:12.560- 02:18.800* :  convoys, which was clearly marked, has been attacked in Sudan, killing two people and injuring seven.
*02:21.640- 02:27.440* :  Also in this podcast, one of only 12 red dwarf tomatoes germinated and grown to
*02:27.440- 02:33.360* :  rightness on the craft went missing. So, is it a case of lost in space? What happened to this
*02:33.660- 02:36.760* :  unique specimen grown in the International Space Station?
*02:40.500- 02:46.400* :  Argentina's new president Javier Millet says shock treatment is needed to deal with the country's
*02:46.400- 02:52.760* :  severe economic crisis. After being sworn in, he pledged to bury decades of failure. From Buenos Aires,
*02:52.760- 02:55.480* :  his are South America correspondent Katie Watson.
*02:56.200- 03:01.220* :  Javier Millet was sworn into huge applause,
*03:01.220- 03:07.680* :  chance of yes he can and freedom from those who voted for him. This is a new political path
*03:07.680- 03:12.460* :  that Argentina's embarking on, as he reflected himself in his speech shortly afterwards.
*03:17.840- 03:23.960* :  Today begins a new era for Argentina. Today ends a long and sad history of
*03:23.960- 03:30.420* :  decadence and decline and we start the journey of rebuilding our country. There's no going back.
*03:30.420- 03:36.540* :  Today we buried decades of failure. Mr. Millet has been hugely critical of traditional politics in
*03:36.540- 03:41.480* :  Argentina. Just as the Berlin Wall marked the end of a tragic period for the world, he said
*03:41.980- 03:46.880* :  these elections have marked a tipping point for Argentina's history. But most of Javier Millet's
*03:46.880- 03:53.480* :  speech was dedicated to the country's economic crisis. Argentina is facing 150% annual inflation
*03:53.480- 03:58.520* :  and four in ten Argentinians now live in poverty. He warned that cuts would be coming,
*03:59.140- 04:04.000* :  delivering on his campaign promise of slashing government spending. As an alternative to the
*04:04.000- 04:09.580* :  shock he said, Argentina has no money and this he admitted would have an impact on wages, the
*04:09.580- 04:15.140* :  economy and poverty. There's no doubt his honeymoon period will be short. Argentinians are fed up
*04:15.140- 04:21.500* :  of hoping for change. Katie Watson reporting. I ask Katie if Mr. Millet could manage to take both
*04:21.500- 04:27.660* :  pragmatic steps such as appointing a former central banker as his economy minister and at the
*04:27.660- 04:33.160* :  same time please his voters who supported him because of his radical ideas. The fact that he's
*04:33.500- 04:38.920* :  shown a bit more pragmatism, well that might disappoint those people who wanted him to be a bit more
*04:38.920- 04:44.480* :  extreme. It might reassure those people who were worried that his radical policies would make
*04:44.480- 04:49.520* :  things worse. But that's the issue. I think having Millet has to tread very carefully. A country
*04:49.520- 04:56.020* :  in crisis, people fed up. They want improvement and they want to see it fast. It's interesting. Luis
*04:56.020- 05:00.760* :  Guadalupe was the new economy minister and he is a former central bank governor and of course
*05:01.080- 05:04.980* :  having Millet said he wanted to blow up the central bank so that probably needs some negotiating.
*05:04.980- 05:12.540* :  He comes from more of a traditional conservative background. He worked for Macri who was a conservative
*05:12.540- 05:17.900* :  who lost in 2019. So he's clearly taking advice from people who've already been in positions of
*05:17.900- 05:23.720* :  power in the economy and positions of power on the right. So he's trying to forge a way forward
*05:23.840- 05:28.000* :  whether that's going to be dollarization, probably not quite yet, probably not blowing up the
*05:28.000- 05:32.040* :  central bank either. But I mean neither all discussions that need to be put on the table straight
*05:32.040- 05:36.380* :  to where I don't think anybody really has an idea exactly how he's going to achieve this. I mean
*05:36.380- 05:40.340* :  people have tried before and failed and that's going to be his biggest challenge. It's going to
*05:40.340- 05:44.240* :  be a difficult few years. So he's made that very clear and I speak that it's not going to be easy
*05:44.240- 05:49.920* :  going forward. Katie Watts. The World Health Organization has adopted a resolution calling for
*05:49.920- 05:55.800* :  immediate humanitarian aid for Gaza. Speaking before the meeting in Geneva, the WHO's chief,
*05:55.800- 06:01.740* :  Tedros Athanon-Gibberish, said the war there was having a catastrophic impact on health care.
*06:02.220- 06:08.940* :  1.9 million people have been displaced. Almost the entire population of the Gaza Strip and are
*06:08.940- 06:17.660* :  looking for shelter anywhere they can find it. But nowhere and no one is safe in Gaza.
*06:18.460- 06:22.620* :  As more and more people move to a smaller and smaller area,
*06:23.980- 06:30.560* :  overcrowding combined with the lack of adequate food, water, shelter and hydration
*06:31.460- 06:36.280* :  are creating the ideal conditions for diseases to spread.
*06:36.840- 06:41.600* :  Well, the Hamas-Ran Health Ministry says 18,000 people have now been killed across Gaza,
*06:42.120- 06:48.440* :  nearly 300 of those within the last 24 hours. Israel, meanwhile, has reiterated that it is
*06:48.440- 06:53.940* :  committed to minimizing civilian casualties. It's telling people to leave the southern city of Khan
*06:53.940- 06:59.680* :  Unis where fighting has continued to intensify. I'm Italy's correspondent Hugo Bashega reports.
*07:06.560- 07:11.760* :  A desperate father searches for his son at the Nasr Hospital in Khan Unis after another night
*07:11.760- 07:17.400* :  of intense Israeli attacks. Fighter jets have continued to pound the city as Israeli tanks
*07:17.400- 07:22.200* :  advance from two directions. First fighting is also happening in the north with the Israeli
*07:22.200- 07:27.760* :  military carrying out operations in Jabalya and Shijaya. Across the territory, the humanitarian
*07:27.760- 07:34.340* :  situation is catastrophic according to the UN. It says half of Gaza's population is starving.
*07:35.080- 07:38.740* :  Philippi Lazardini is the head of the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees.
*07:39.220- 07:46.000* :  People are psychologically broke today. Everything has been destroyed. And most of the people
*07:46.000- 07:51.220* :  are meeting there. They say, I don't see my future anymore in Gaza. I have enough. My children
*07:51.220- 07:56.820* :  have known only war. He also accused Israel of trying to engineer the mass expulsion of
*07:56.820- 08:02.300* :  Gaza's into Egypt by pushing people to the south of the territory and depriving the population
*08:02.300- 08:07.600* :  of humanitarian aid. The claims were dismissed by an Israeli government spokesman as
*08:07.600- 08:13.720* :  ultrages and false. With dozens of Palestinians being killed every day, pressure is growing on Israel
*08:13.720- 08:19.200* :  to do more to protect civilians. But the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected
*08:19.200- 08:27.240* :  proposals for a ceasefire. Addressing his cabinet, he said countries couldn't support the
*08:27.240- 08:32.320* :  elimination of Hamas and at the same time put pressure on Israel to end the war, which would
*08:32.320- 08:38.220* :  prevent the elimination of Hamas. Reports on Israeli media say officials believe intense operations
*08:38.220- 08:44.120* :  will continue until early February. If the Israeli tactics don't change, thousands more in Gaza
*08:44.120- 08:51.380* :  won't be alive by then. Hugo Bachega. The 2023 Nobel Peace Prize was handed out on Sunday,
*08:51.680- 08:56.640* :  but this year's winner, Nargez Mohammedi, wasn't there to receive the award at the ceremony
*08:56.640- 09:03.160* :  in Oslo City Hall. She was detained in Iran in 2021 and is currently serving a 10-year sentence
*09:03.160- 09:10.080* :  in Terran's event prison. Bachman Kalbassi from the BBC's Persian Service watched the ceremony
*09:10.080- 09:17.160* :  in the Norwegian capital. In a moving and what will be likely a historic moment for the human
*09:17.160- 09:25.440* :  rights defenders in Iran, a city of Oslo hosted its annual Nobel Peace Prize event and awarded
*09:25.500- 09:32.660* :  the prize to a human rights defender behind bars. Nargez Mohammedi has spent better half of the
*09:32.660- 09:41.200* :  last two decades in prison because of her criticism of the Iranian government and that made her
*09:41.200- 09:49.280* :  one of the only five people. The history 120 plus years history of the Nobel institution that
*09:49.280- 09:57.420* :  has not been able to receive her award in person. This is part of the speech by the chair of the
*09:57.420- 10:04.560* :  Nobel Prize Committee who spoke about why Nargez Mohammedi was very much qualified to get this award.
*10:04.940- 10:13.620* :  By focusing on women's rights, Nargez Mohammedi is highlighting the universal right to equality.
*10:14.420- 10:22.000* :  She has fought restrictions imposed on women such as the forced wearing of the hijab and other
*10:22.000- 10:29.680* :  covering garments as well as prohibitions involving sports, dance and movement in general.
*10:29.680- 10:37.480* :  Nargez Mohammedi's children, 17-year-old twins Ali and Kiana received the award on her behalf.
*10:37.480- 10:44.740* :  There was an empty chair for her where the award was placed as a symbol of her absence.
*10:44.740- 10:51.540* :  The children also read her message to the international community in which she denounced the tyranny
*10:51.540- 11:02.680* :  of the Iranian government. I am one of millions of proud and resistant Iranian women
*11:02.680- 11:09.720* :  who stood up against injustice, repression, discrimination and tyranny. I remember the women,
*11:09.720- 11:15.020* :  anonymous and courageous, who led a life of resistance in different areas despite
*11:15.420- 11:21.360* :  repression. I write this message behind the high gold walls of the prison. I am a woman from
*11:21.360- 11:27.060* :  the Middle East, from a region which, although air to a rich civilization, is currently trapped
*11:27.060- 11:32.440* :  in war and prey to the flames of terrorism and extremism.
*11:32.600- 11:37.900* :  That report was by Bachmann Kalbassi. Now to the United States, it's an American landmark,
*11:37.900- 11:44.420* :  an iconic Los Angeles landmark to be precise, but did you know the Hollywood sign is a hundred
*11:44.420- 11:50.140* :  years old, and so is Tinseltown. And if it needed any excuse, it's celebrating.
*11:50.140- 11:55.420* :  Millions of people visit this tourist attraction every year, hoping for a photo or selfie.
*11:55.740- 11:56.700* :  Wendy Urkert reports.
*12:12.640- 12:18.640* :  The Hollywood sign trust celebrated the 100-year milestone by lighting up the Hollywood sign letters
*12:18.640- 12:26.380* :  with the original 4,000 vintage bulbs that illuminated the real estate sign Hollywood land in 1923.
*12:26.980- 12:32.940* :  They also bought 400 gallons of white paint to give the letters a makeover, which is no mean
*12:32.940- 12:39.120* :  feat, considering each one is 14 meters tall and at least 9 meters wide. Adam Burke,
*12:39.120- 12:45.220* :  who CEO of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board, says the sign not only looks pristine,
*12:45.220- 12:48.620* :  it generates billions of dollars for local businesses.
*12:49.180- 12:54.180* :  The Hollywood sign really is our global icon. It is the reason people choose to come to LA,
*12:54.180- 12:58.420* :  not just because of getting that bucket list photo with a Hollywood sign in the background,
*12:58.420- 13:02.940* :  but also because it represents the fact that LA is the city of endless possibility.
*13:02.940- 13:10.000* :  The local business community received over $34 billion in sales last year fund visitors to LA.
*13:10.680- 13:16.600* :  It's hard to believe that way back in the 1800s, Hollywood California was a wasteland where
*13:16.600- 13:22.260* :  cowboys roamed and livestock grazed, but when people living on the eastern seaboard started to
*13:22.260- 13:27.640* :  drift west in search of sunny skies and a drier climate, it sparked a boom in real estate,
*13:27.640- 13:33.800* :  and the wife of the town founder, Harvey Wilcox, suggested the iconic name after meeting a woman
*13:33.800- 13:39.840* :  who'd called her Florida summer home, Hollywood. When atrocious weather force a tiny Chicago
*13:39.840- 13:45.580* :  company to head to California to finish a shoot in 1907, other film companies took note,
*13:45.580- 13:50.140* :  and within five years film companies were springing up all over the place,
*13:50.600- 13:54.340* :  turning old barns and derelict buildings into sparkling studios.
*13:54.340- 14:00.800* :  The sign became the property of the city in the 1940s, but by then it was very dilapidated,
*14:00.800- 14:08.160* :  and several of the letters were falling apart. In 1978, a fundraiser by Playboy founder Hugh Hefner
*14:08.160- 14:14.840* :  was a huge success, with individual letters auctioned off at around $28,000 each.
*14:14.840- 14:21.880* :  The glitterati loved it, and before long, the old sign had been replaced with a brand new one.
*14:22.360- 14:26.720* :  Now the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the city of Los Angeles, and the Hollywood sign trust
*14:26.720- 14:33.400* :  are responsible for the maintenance and repair of what is undoubtedly Hollywood's biggest star.
*14:41.460- 14:46.120* :  That report was by Wendy Irkhardt. Still to come.
*14:46.540- 14:51.380* :  Wall that's blanched in warm water, then take a quantity of rue, which is a herb,
*14:51.380- 14:56.800* :  and an equal quantity of bay leaf. Beat together, put into a fig, and then eat it.
*14:57.160- 15:03.140* :  A medieval remedy to ward off plagues discovered as a university library digitises
*15:11.660- 15:11.720* :  its ancient manuscripts.

*16:18.100- 16:21.460* :  Something mysterious plagues County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland,
*16:21.460- 16:24.920* :  and its legendary Gaelic football team. I believe in the curse.
*16:25.160- 16:30.140* :  Yeah, I think it's real. Is it just superstition? Or could there be more to it?
*16:30.140- 16:33.440* :  Sometimes I think there's something sinister going on.
*16:33.720- 16:36.220* :  What do we need to do to win an all-in-final for Mayo?

*16:49.820- 16:56.400* :  Three days of voting got underway on Sunday for millions of people in Egypt's presidential election,
*16:56.920- 17:00.820* :  with Abdelphata Al-Sisi all but certain to win a third term.
*17:01.240- 17:04.460* :  There are three other candidates, all are relative unknowns.
*17:04.460- 17:08.180* :  The election is being held against a backdrop of economic crisis.
*17:08.300- 17:13.420* :  President Sisi's supporters have been trying to project a message of stability and optimism.
*17:14.060- 17:16.620* :  Selling a bill reports from the Egyptian capital, Cairo.
*17:20.620- 17:27.980* :  A decade ago, many Egyptians took to the streets to celebrate the man they then saw as their savior.
*17:28.760- 17:33.260* :  Huge posters of Abdelphata Al-Sisi were hung all over Cairo.
*17:34.080- 17:39.360* :  But today, the general-turned-president faces a very different reality.
*17:40.740- 17:44.340* :  Nadiya is a proud mother of six.
*17:44.900- 17:51.740* :  The 57-year-old widow can hardly make a living selling newspapers in a small kiosk.
*17:54.000- 17:57.240* :  In her modest flat in one of Cairo's populous slums,
*17:57.880- 18:01.280* :  which at while she's doing the dishes in her tiny kitchen,
*18:02.160- 18:10.840* :  I can see the pain in her eyes when she says she hasn't been able to afford meat in three years.
*18:12.020- 18:15.200* :  Cooking a meal used to cost 60 or 70 pounds.
*18:15.200- 18:18.520* :  Now it costs between 300 and 500.
*18:18.620- 18:24.820* :  Sometimes I'm too scared to go to bed because I know that the next morning prices will go up.
*18:25.160- 18:28.620* :  We don't have a future. It's swallowed up by price hikes.
*18:29.240- 18:31.580* :  No one thinks of the poor. No one sees us.
*18:32.180- 18:38.400* :  Since President Sisi took power, vast sums of money have been allocated to huge infrastructure
*18:38.400- 18:45.560* :  projects. Wherever you go in Cairo, you see flyovers being built, roads being expanded,
*18:46.260- 18:52.580* :  let alone the new capital that has cost billions of dollars and is still barely inhabited.
*18:53.240- 18:58.020* :  Critics believe this approach has drained Egypt's financial resources,
*18:58.020- 19:06.660* :  but supporters say such rapid urban expansion has helped create jobs and will eventually usher in
*19:06.660- 19:14.820* :  more prosperous times. Since March 2023, the Egyptian pound has lost more than 50 percent of its
*19:14.820- 19:22.340* :  value against the dollar. President Sisi's human rights record has also drawn
*19:22.340- 19:26.360* :  widespread criticism. I would really love to tell you that.
*19:26.720- 19:32.740* :  Mina is a human rights activist who has been living in a self-imposed exile in the UK
*19:32.740- 19:36.980* :  for nearly six years. The human rights business in Egypt is very dangerous.
*19:37.600- 19:42.000* :  Me and the human rights defender and the human rights researcher, I can't do my work freely
*19:42.000- 19:48.440* :  without fear of prosecution, of fear of being sent back to jail. Many of my colleagues still
*19:48.440- 19:56.900* :  under travel ban their assets are frozen. The state has long dismissed such criticism as
*19:56.900- 20:02.580* :  politicized. This presidential election is largely seen as a one-horse race.
*20:02.620- 20:09.960* :  The potential opposition from Trunner former MP Ahmad Tontawi is on trial, facing charges
*20:09.960- 20:16.680* :  of printing and circulating election papers without authorization. These days in Cairo,
*20:17.160- 20:23.460* :  banners hanging everywhere try to convince voters that a new term for Mr. Sisi
*20:23.460- 20:30.660* :  means better days to come. But many Egyptians wonder if anything will really change.
*20:32.360- 20:38.140* :  Salina Biel reporting from Cairo. The international committee of the Red Cross says it is shocked
*20:38.140- 20:43.700* :  by a deliberate attack on a humanitarian convoy in the Sudanese capital Khartoum.
*20:43.900- 20:49.240* :  It said two people were killed and seven injured. Our Africa regional editor Will Ross reports.
*20:49.240- 20:53.020* :  The international committee of the Red Cross said vehicles clearly marked with the
*20:53.020- 20:58.280* :  organization's emblem would do to evacuate over 100 civilians to safety when they came under attack.
*20:58.280- 21:03.460* :  It said both the Sudanese army and the rapid support forces had earlier given security guarantees.
*21:03.580- 21:08.960* :  A statement from the army blamed the aid agency. Meanwhile, once again, we're being told that
*21:09.020- 21:14.320* :  the army chief Abdul Fatt al-Burhan and the RSF leader Muhammad Hamdan Daghalo are ready to
*21:14.320- 21:19.540* :  talk peace. But many similar statements have come to nothing. The feuding generals jointly staged
*21:19.540- 21:24.520* :  a coup two years ago that halted Sudan's transition to democracy. Will Ross.
*21:25.680- 21:32.220* :  The brother of Diana Princess of Wales has accused BBC senior managers of trying to hide behind
*21:32.220- 21:36.840* :  lawyers to prevent the release of thousands of emails relating to an interview with his
*21:36.840- 21:42.540* :  late sister. The former BBC journalist Martin Bashir faked documents to secure the interview
*21:42.880- 21:49.280* :  in 1995 in which Diana famously said there were three people in her marriage to the then Prince
*21:49.280- 21:53.640* :  Charles. Our culture correspondent Charlotte Gallagher told me more about the emails.
*21:54.060- 22:01.340* :  These emails relate to a two-month period in 2020. Martin Bashir was back at the BBC but was on sick
*22:02.220- 22:06.580* :  and this was the time when questions were really mounting about his interview with Princess
*22:06.580- 22:11.600* :  Diana and how he secured it. Of course Nick, we now know he secured that interview through
*22:11.600- 22:17.500* :  deception and faking documents. Now an investigative journalist called Andy Webb used a freedom
*22:17.500- 22:22.880* :  of information request here in the UK to try to access the emails of senior managers and Martin
*22:22.880- 22:28.020* :  Bashir over that two-month period in 2020. He wanted to know what they knew about Martin Bashir
*22:28.020- 22:33.220* :  and what they were doing when he received a small number of emails. He then went to a judge.
*22:33.220- 22:39.720* :  It's emerged that there were in fact over 3,000 emails sent in that two-month period. However,
*22:39.720- 22:45.940* :  the BBC are saying that they are irrelevant or contain legally privileged information but the
*22:45.940- 22:51.000* :  judges said to them you do have to release a large number of these emails now to this journalist.
*22:51.000- 22:56.400* :  He also criticised the BBC for the way it handled the case saying it was inconsistent, erroneous
*22:56.400- 23:01.340* :  and unreliable, saying it was a cause for serious concern. Princess Diana's brother,
*23:01.340- 23:05.360* :  Earl Spencer, he believes there has been a cover-up at the top of the BBC.
*23:05.960- 23:11.940* :  It's about people who are still in power in the BBC who have taken decisions that I question
*23:11.940- 23:17.380* :  and the judge has certainly questioned. As is often the case in these things, it's the cover-up,
*23:17.380- 23:22.660* :  not the actual origins of such a case that becomes more increasingly worrying but I see this
*23:22.660- 23:29.640* :  as a point of principle. I believe the BBC should be guarded by responsible senior figures and
*23:29.640- 23:34.760* :  not hidden behind to protect their careers. So Charlotte, what else has the BBC been saying?
*23:35.000- 23:40.480* :  They've issued a statement next saying that they accept mistakes were made in this case in the past
*23:40.560- 23:46.280* :  and they are working to improve their processes. They say they have also apologised to Andy Webb
*23:46.280- 23:53.280* :  and the tribunal. Charlotte Gallagher. The Library of Trinity College in the Irish capital Dublin
*23:53.280- 23:59.020* :  is renowned throughout the world for its collection of medieval manuscripts. The most famous is
*23:59.020- 24:04.480* :  the Book of Kels, an illuminated manuscript containing the four biblical New Testament
*24:04.480- 24:09.900* :  Gospels, but the library is also home to at least 600 other precious medieval manuscripts
*24:09.900- 24:15.260* :  dating from the 5th to the 16th centuries and with origins across Western Europe.
*24:15.780- 24:20.380* :  On Thursday, a project was launched to put the manuscripts online so that the public
*24:20.380- 24:25.560* :  could have free access to them. Sixty of the manuscripts have now been digitised into about
*24:25.560- 24:32.240* :  16,000 high quality images. Paul Henley spoke to Estelle Gittings, the manuscript curator
*24:32.240- 24:38.040* :  at the Library of Trinity College. She sent him some of the images to look at so he began by asking
*24:38.080- 24:42.180* :  her about the language of the manuscripts that he found hard to decipher.
*24:51.680- 24:57.640* :  The ones that we're talking about are actually in Latin, but often you'll find more than one
*24:57.640- 25:03.960* :  language in a single manuscript. So one of them, the Matthew Paris Book of St. Albans, is in Latin
*25:03.960- 25:11.260* :  but also French. It also has annotations in English. Can you tell which manuscripts will be in
*25:11.260- 25:17.360* :  highest demand? You often can't tell in advance, but we often find the really visual ones
*25:17.360- 25:23.180* :  attracting awful lot of attention and we've got some proper beauties that have been digitised.
*25:23.580- 25:30.180* :  So we have a lot of images of medieval people working, we have medieval kings, but then ordinary
*25:30.180- 25:35.940* :  people as well, lots of animals, lots of beautiful colourful images of animals. But then we've also
*25:35.940- 25:43.220* :  got a lot of manuscripts that are less decorative, but they are really informative for how people live
*25:43.220- 25:48.440* :  their everyday lives in the medieval period. So not just religious writing, we're talking about
*25:48.440- 25:54.340* :  medicinal recipes, what else? That's right, there are religious books, there's very lavish books
*25:54.340- 26:00.180* :  made for very important, very rich people, but then there are also collections of much smaller,
*26:00.180- 26:05.880* :  really useful texts that would be important for say religious community, but then there's also
*26:05.900- 26:12.780* :  dictionaries in some other books they've been reused. So you will find recipes, you'll find
*26:12.780- 26:19.920* :  recipes or cures for ailments. So if someone has a sore mouth or a sore back, for example, we've
*26:19.920- 26:24.360* :  got cures for that, we've also got one for the plague, which is really quite interesting.
*26:24.360- 26:30.500* :  Tell me about that. Well, I've actually got a little transcription of it here and it seems
*26:30.500- 26:35.440* :  quite simple and the ingredients almost seem quite modern and it reads,
*26:35.440- 26:41.860* :  walnuts blanched in warm water, then take a quantity of rue which is a herb and an equal quantity
*26:41.860- 26:47.700* :  of bay leaf, beat together, put into a fig and then eat it and that's apparently to ward off
*26:47.740- 26:52.780* :  plague. So that sounds really doable. Not quite convincing either, there's advice on
*26:53.020- 26:58.620* :  the benefits of eating cheese, I hear. There is in another one of the manuscripts, there's a text
*26:58.640- 27:04.320* :  on the medicinal properties of cheese, but then it's bound within a volume with lots of other
*27:04.320- 27:10.520* :  little texts and another one of them actually has a cat's paw print where a cat has walked over
*27:10.520- 27:16.620* :  the manuscript whilst the scribe was either writing it and the cat wanted his attention or somebody
*27:16.620- 27:21.240* :  had left it open when they were reading it. Not all these manuscripts originate in Ireland,
*27:21.240- 27:25.620* :  somewhere from the Netherlands, Italy, how did Trinity College Dublin end up having them?
*27:25.920- 27:32.120* :  Trinity College Dublin was founded in 1592 by Elizabeth I and there was a library pretty much
*27:32.120- 27:37.960* :  since it was founded and there were a number of people who were involved in the setting up of
*27:37.960- 27:43.620* :  the college who were buying books at the time and a lot of these books would have been in circulation
*27:44.340- 27:50.800* :  after the Reformation. So after, in particular in Britain, after the monasteries were all closed
*27:50.800- 27:56.620* :  down, there was a big book trade and people were buying four universities like Oxford and Cambridge
*27:56.620- 28:03.060* :  and Trinity College Dublin. Estelle Gittings from Trinity College Library in Dublin and finally
*28:03.060- 28:09.700* :  some good news for one NASA astronaut who'd been living under a cosmic cloud of suspicion after
*28:09.700- 28:14.900* :  a tomato went missing on the International Space Station. Stephanie Prentice has the story.
*28:15.740- 28:23.600* :  The astronaut Frank Rubio returned to Earth in September after spending a record 371 days in space
*28:24.360- 28:30.020* :  but this achievement was marred by suspicions he'd eaten a precious resource while up there.
*28:30.540- 28:36.800* :  One of only 12 red dwarf tomatoes germinated and grown to rightness on the craft went missing
*28:36.800- 28:43.460* :  on his watch. They were the first of the fruit ever grown in space. Frank Rubio said he remembered
*28:43.460- 28:49.300* :  Velcroing the tomato in place after being given it but returned to find it gone. He said he
*28:49.300- 28:54.220* :  searched for it for 20 hours and pointed out the weightless environment meant it could have floated
*28:54.220- 29:00.740* :  off anywhere on the space station which is larger than a six bedroom house. His colleagues up there
*29:00.740- 29:06.660* :  had their own ideas speculating that he'd eaten it and branding him ate a motto thief.
*29:06.960- 29:13.680* :  Now two months after the unfortunate incident his otherwise spotless record has been reinstated
*29:13.680- 29:17.420* :  after the team currently up there revealed they'd made a discovery.
*29:18.000- 29:24.220* :  Our good friend Frank Rubio who headed home has been blamed for quite a while for
*29:24.780- 29:30.640* :  eating the tomato but we can exonerate him. We found the tomatoes.
*29:31.180- 29:36.500* :  Good news for team morale and good news for Frank who prior to being known as a tomato thief was
*29:36.500- 29:43.340* :  seen as a pioneer in his field leading NASA's veggie program. Whether tomato had been all this time
*29:43.340- 29:49.460* :  or what state the rogue fruit was found in are yet to be revealed but it's probably safe to say
*29:49.460- 29:53.520* :  none of Frank's colleagues will be tempted to eat it. Stephanie Prentice.
