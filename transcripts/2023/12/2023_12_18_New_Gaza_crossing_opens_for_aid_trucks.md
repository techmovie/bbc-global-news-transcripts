*01:27.660- 01:29.740* :  Annakarashi and in the early hours of Monday,
*01:29.740- 01:32.340* :  the 18th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:32.340- 01:36.440* :  There have been renewed appeals for a big increase in age deliveries to Gaza.
*01:36.440- 01:40.020* :  After Israel opened one of its own crossings into the territory
*01:40.020- 01:42.260* :  for the first time since the war began.
*01:42.500- 01:47.080* :  The Israeli military has released video evidence of what it says is the biggest tunnel
*01:47.080- 01:50.000* :  built by Hamas that it's discovered so far.
*01:50.500- 01:54.140* :  And the Colombian government has welcomed a promise by ELN rebels
*01:54.460- 01:56.440* :  to end decades of hostage-taking.
*01:58.620- 01:59.760* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:00.140- 02:02.620* :  You don't always get the thing that you want,
*02:02.860- 02:05.760* :  but you always give your presence if you're nice.
*02:06.280- 02:10.160* :  The extent children are going to get a Christmas present from Santa.
*02:13.600- 02:18.380* :  Trucks carrying humanitarian aid have entered the Gaza Strip directly from Israel
*02:18.380- 02:21.960* :  for the first time since the Hamas attacks of October 7th.
*02:22.120- 02:25.440* :  The supplies passed through the newly reopened Kharam Shalom crossing
*02:26.000- 02:29.320* :  aid deliveries had previously only been allowed into Gaza
*02:29.320- 02:31.160* :  via the Rafa crossing with Egypt.
*02:31.740- 02:34.840* :  It's hoped the decision to open the Kharam Shalom crossing
*02:35.280- 02:38.000* :  will double the number of vehicles reaching the enclave each day,
*02:38.000- 02:43.100* :  but Hamish young from UNICEF says much more commitment to getting aid into Gaza is needed.
*02:43.580- 02:46.280* :  The opening of the Kharam Shalom crossing is promising,
*02:46.680- 02:48.000* :  but it's important to stress.
*02:48.420- 02:52.140* :  It's not going to make any difference really to the overarching
*02:52.140- 02:54.520* :  the pre-humanitarian ceasefire.
*02:54.760- 03:00.060* :  There used to be around 450 trucks working inside Gaza.
*03:00.060- 03:03.620* :  Because of the war, there's now only about 120 that are functioning.
*03:04.120- 03:07.680* :  On Sunday, videos emerged from Rafa of people clambering onto trucks
*03:07.680- 03:08.760* :  and looting supplies.
*03:09.240- 03:12.680* :  UN has warned that half of Gaza's population is starving.
*03:12.680- 03:16.600* :  For weeks, there has been little clean drinking water or medicine.
*03:17.120- 03:21.140* :  On Saturday, the World Health Organization did manage to deliver some medical supplies
*03:21.140- 03:23.960* :  to Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza.
*03:24.500- 03:28.680* :  Sean K.C., the organization's emergency medical team's co-ordinator,
*03:29.020- 03:31.280* :  said the hospital is completely overwhelmed
*03:31.280- 03:35.360* :  and can only provide the most basic care to patients.
*03:35.920- 03:39.860* :  James Menendez spoke to him about the latest efforts to bring aid into Gaza.
*03:40.360- 03:42.480* :  He says it's only a fraction of what's needed.
*03:42.960- 03:47.000* :  Well, there's almost nobody that I've met in the Gaza Strip,
*03:47.080- 03:50.640* :  but particularly in northern part, who is in great authority.
*03:50.640- 03:53.520* :  Even at Al-Shifa Hospital, people with serious injuries yesterday
*03:54.160- 03:56.400* :  were asking for food and water.
*03:56.780- 03:58.480* :  There has not been enough supply coming in.
*03:58.680- 04:03.180* :  The more trucks that come in with food and water and fuel and medicines
*04:03.180- 04:05.280* :  and medical equipment, the better for this population.
*04:05.680- 04:08.980* :  Everybody is in dire straits here, not eating enough,
*04:09.600- 04:11.420* :  not able to access safe drinking water,
*04:11.780- 04:13.320* :  not able to access shelter supplies.
*04:13.860- 04:15.760* :  Winter is here and is coming.
*04:15.760- 04:18.720* :  There's some very cold nights. We've had some very wet days and nights.
*04:18.960- 04:21.360* :  So there's a huge need for a whole range of items,
*04:21.360- 04:24.380* :  and it's great news that more will be coming across.
*04:24.840- 04:26.740* :  But still a desperate situation.
*04:26.900- 04:30.700* :  I mean, how does it compare to other emergencies you've had to deal with?
*04:30.700- 04:32.940* :  Is this as bad as it gets?
*04:33.640- 04:37.960* :  I think a lot of us in WHO and in other humanitarian agencies
*04:37.960- 04:42.540* :  that are here have seen very difficult and challenging circumstances,
*04:42.540- 04:45.220* :  very sad circumstances with a lot of suffering.
*04:45.600- 04:49.200* :  I haven't seen hospitals so overwhelmed ever before,
*04:49.200- 04:55.300* :  and for such a long period, I can't imagine being in the position of hospital staff
*04:55.300- 05:00.080* :  with no anesthesia and no equipment, no water trying to care for patients
*05:00.720- 05:03.680* :  who are streaming in constantly with various injuries
*05:03.960- 05:08.060* :  or being a mother who needs to deliver in the baby in these circumstances.
*05:08.060- 05:13.080* :  It's absolutely horrendous, and it's among the worst many of us have seen.
*05:13.640- 05:15.140* :  There's a huge level of suffering,
*05:15.860- 05:19.160* :  and the only real solution to this immediately,
*05:19.160- 05:22.280* :  and in a sustainable way, as a ceasefire in the interim,
*05:22.280- 05:26.240* :  what we're doing is providing some relief for the short term,
*05:26.680- 05:29.180* :  but there's still just an unbelievable amount of suffering
*05:29.540- 05:30.580* :  all across the Gaza Strip.
*05:31.120- 05:33.320* :  Sean Casey from the World Health Organization.
*05:34.340- 05:37.460* :  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has restated his
*05:37.460- 05:39.500* :  opposition to a ceasefire in Gaza.
*05:39.500- 05:45.000* :  The Hamas Run Health Ministry says the death toll of Palestinians in Gaza is around 19,000,
*05:45.480- 05:48.560* :  and some of Israel's closest allies like Germany and the UK,
*05:48.560- 05:52.260* :  are calling for a ceasefire if it's sustainable in the long term.
*05:52.620- 05:54.940* :  Our France's Foreign Minister, Catrine Colonar,
*05:55.280- 05:57.700* :  who's been visiting the region is going even further.
*05:58.520- 06:01.560* :  What we are saying is that an immediate truce is necessary,
*06:02.040- 06:04.560* :  allowing progress to be made towards a ceasefire,
*06:04.880- 06:06.680* :  to obtain the release of the hostages,
*06:07.060- 06:10.260* :  to allow access and the delivery of more humanitarian aid
*06:10.260- 06:12.640* :  to the suffering civilian population of Gaza,
*06:13.020- 06:17.360* :  because we must now think about the return of a political horizon to deal with this conflict.
*06:18.100- 06:22.660* :  So what is the situation regarding diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the fighting?
*06:22.660- 06:26.200* :  I put that to our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, who's in Jerusalem.
*06:26.900- 06:31.180* :  When this conflict began on October the 7th and Israel began its retaliation
*06:31.180- 06:37.480* :  for the horrific raids by Hamas into the into southern Israel that killed so many people,
*06:37.480- 06:43.980* :  over a thousand people, the support that Israel got from its allies and much of the world
*06:44.680- 06:47.240* :  at the time appeared to be pretty much unconditional,
*06:48.120- 06:52.700* :  but that support is certainly eroding now because of the extent of the casualties that
*06:52.700- 06:57.020* :  Israel's military actions are causing. You can't go into a place like Gaza
*06:57.660- 07:01.020* :  and launch air strikes, artillery strikes, drone strikes,
*07:01.660- 07:05.040* :  and all the rest of it and not expect to have high civilian casualties.
*07:05.940- 07:10.980* :  And that is exactly what is happening. Even if you don't trust the Hamas run
*07:10.980- 07:17.580* :  casualty figures of 19,000 almost killed so far, even half that number would be an
*07:17.580- 07:21.040* :  unacceptably high number of people to have been killed so far.
*07:21.040- 07:26.900* :  So you've got Germany and Britain saying that they want to see a sustainable ceasefire
*07:26.900- 07:32.280* :  leading to a sustainable peace, and you've got the French foreign minister going further than
*07:32.280- 07:35.860* :  that, calling for an immediate ceasefire. In other words, in line with what the rest of the world
*07:35.860- 07:42.020* :  has been calling for for some time, that is resisted by Israel, specifically by Prime Minister
*07:42.020- 07:47.460* :  Benjamin Netanyahu, because he says, if we give Hamas a ceasefire now, they will simply
*07:47.460- 07:53.740* :  rearm, restock, and come back and hit us harder again. As indeed, Hamas have vowed to do,
*07:53.980- 07:56.240* :  they have said, we're not going to give up the fight. We're going to keep on
*07:56.240- 08:00.180* :  when we have the opportunity. We're going to hit them again. Now, Hamas have said,
*08:00.180- 08:07.200* :  in the last couple of hours, here are conditions for returning the hostages. We need an
*08:07.200- 08:11.340* :  immediate and permanent ceasefire and a withdrawal of Israeli troops before we can discuss
*08:11.340- 08:16.800* :  giving back the hostages. That's not the way Israel sees it. So it's all very well to talk about
*08:16.800- 08:23.120* :  negotiations, but the two sides are a long way apart. And tell us about this vast tunnel that
*08:23.120- 08:28.780* :  Israel says it's unearthed. Yes, the Israel Defence Forces, the IDF, which is their word for
*08:28.780- 08:33.620* :  their military, have revealed details and shown pictures of this huge tunnel complex,
*08:34.160- 08:38.080* :  the biggest ones so far. I mean, everybody knew there were tunnels underneath Gaza, but these
*08:38.080- 08:43.700* :  are huge, they're saying. And in fact, they've shown pictures of it. They say that this is as close
*08:43.700- 08:48.640* :  as 400 meters to the area it's crossing. So above ground, you've got this four more checkpoint
*08:48.640- 08:56.100* :  wherein peaceful times or more peaceful times, Palestinian guest workers were crossing into Israel
*08:56.100- 09:02.120* :  to work on the farms and other light industries in southern Israel. But underneath, you had this
*09:02.120- 09:07.560* :  great big military complex, big enough to drive a tractor through. And the Israeli Defence
*09:07.560- 09:13.460* :  Forces, saying, look at how much it would have cost to build all of these tunnels, millions of
*09:13.460- 09:16.980* :  dollars. That's money that should have been spent for the benefit of people above ground.
*09:17.920- 09:24.240* :  Frank Gardner in Jerusalem. Columbia's ELN rebels have said they'll stop kidnappings for ransom,
*09:24.240- 09:29.460* :  which for decades has been one of their main sources of income. The announcement was made at the
*09:29.460- 09:34.500* :  end of a fifth round of peace talks as Leonardo Rosha reports. The government's chief peace
*09:34.500- 09:40.420* :  negotiator said a group's decision was crucial for peace in Columbia. The ELN or National
*09:40.420- 09:45.780* :  Liberation Army has relied on abductions for money and drug trafficking to support its fight
*09:45.780- 09:51.680* :  against the armed forces, which began in the 1960s. The issue came to the attention of the wider
*09:51.680- 09:57.500* :  world last month when the father of the Liverpool football player, Luis Diaz, was kidnapped and held
*09:57.500- 10:03.720* :  by the ELN for almost two weeks. At the end of the latest round of negotiations, the rebels also
*10:03.720- 10:07.440* :  promised to provide the names of all the hostages they're currently holding.
*10:08.400- 10:13.660* :  To Serbia, where vote projections, following parliamentary and local elections, suggest that
*10:13.660- 10:19.040* :  President Alexander Vučić's party will keep its majority in parliament. The projections
*10:19.040- 10:25.200* :  suggest his Serbian progressives will win almost 47% of the vote. Turnout appears to have been
*10:25.200- 10:30.520* :  similar to last year's election at about 60%. A loose coalition of 15 opposition groups had
*10:30.520- 10:35.100* :  united to challenge Mr Vučić's party, which has been in power for more than a decade.
*10:35.100- 10:42.700* :  These voters had only small hopes of change. We all know why the current situation is not good.
*10:42.840- 10:47.560* :  This election gave us a chance to change something that it gets better for everyone and that we
*10:47.560- 10:54.960* :  finally live as a civilised society. That's it. I think the opposition has a very small chance.
*10:54.980- 11:02.540* :  I wish it were different because autocracy is not good. Most of the opposition favours
*11:02.540- 11:07.740* :  closer ties with the European Union rather than Russia. Just before we recorded this podcast,
*11:07.740- 11:12.940* :  my colleague James Menendez spoke to our Balkans correspondent, Guy Delorny, as counting
*11:12.940- 11:16.660* :  was taking place on Sunday evening. So what were the early results?
*11:16.660- 11:23.500* :  The showing that Mr Vučić's progressive party have done better than I think many people
*11:23.500- 11:29.680* :  expected. It looks like they've taken something like 46% of the vote. That's according to the
*11:29.680- 11:35.480* :  election monitor, Cecid and also the polling organisation Ipsos, who works in conjunction with
*11:35.480- 11:43.800* :  Cecid. They are projecting that the progressive party will get about 46%, and the next
*11:43.800- 11:48.540* :  largest grouping is the Serbia against violence coalition with about half that number of votes,
*11:48.540- 11:56.880* :  23%, and only five electoral lists in total actually passing the 3% threshold to enter parliament.
*11:56.900- 12:01.500* :  There's been quite interestingly something of a collapse in the extreme right wing nationalist
*12:01.500- 12:09.120* :  vote in Serbia, but Prime Minister Anna Borumovic, when she was giving her speech after polls closed
*12:09.120- 12:14.840* :  at progressive party headquarters, she looked extremely satisfied and that these projections
*12:14.860- 12:21.960* :  are born out in the official results. How do you explain how well they've done? My understanding
*12:21.960- 12:26.760* :  was that it was opposition parties that called for this election, so presumably that tactics
*12:26.760- 12:31.400* :  backfired. Yeah, well that was always danger, and that was something that I put to the opposition
*12:31.400- 12:37.080* :  parties when I was talking to them ahead of the election. The progressive party is a very well
*12:37.080- 12:42.800* :  oiled electoral machine, which has a lot of practice at winning elections, of getting its voters
*12:43.040- 12:47.740* :  out to the polling stations and getting them to vote for the progressive party,
*12:48.140- 12:53.480* :  whereas for the past decade or so, there hasn't been a compelling opposition proposition.
*12:53.920- 13:01.440* :  They splinted after the 2012 election into various smaller parties, which there was a lot of
*13:01.440- 13:06.000* :  infighting between, and people didn't really see them as an attractive alternative to the progressives.
*13:06.380- 13:11.960* :  So this coalition was interesting in that we had a coherent alternative to the progressives,
*13:12.240- 13:16.660* :  but everybody was aware that the parties under the umbrella survey against violence
*13:16.660- 13:22.320* :  covered an awful lot of different interest groups from left-wing eco activists through to
*13:22.320- 13:27.800* :  send to right even conservative parties. The only thing they really hadn't common was their
*13:27.800- 13:32.160* :  opposition to the progressive party. And what does it all say about the future direction of the
*13:32.160- 13:38.220* :  country internationally, that sort of constant tension between leaning towards the European Union
*13:38.220- 13:42.100* :  and also perhaps a little bit to Russia too? The funny thing about this election, of course,
*13:42.100- 13:46.500* :  was that both the progressive party and the Serbia against violence coalition were saying they
*13:46.500- 13:52.580* :  were pro-European. They want Serbia to become a member of the European Union. The progressive
*13:52.580- 13:58.700* :  party can point out that the negotiations to join the European Union started while they were in
*13:58.700- 14:04.360* :  government, but at the same time, President Vucic has always spoken about the importance of Serbia's
*14:04.360- 14:08.700* :  friendship with Russia and the fact that there's no way that Serbia is going to recognize
*14:08.700- 14:14.440* :  Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence or engage in what the European Union calls
*14:14.440- 14:21.860* :  de facto recognition of Kosovo. And this is now being written into the conditions for Serbia
*14:21.860- 14:26.860* :  joining the European Union. So it's looking a bit sticky from that point of view, but I have to say
*14:26.860- 14:32.320* :  you'd struggle to find a party with a serious chance of winning seats in this election who would
*14:32.340- 14:37.740* :  have made anything radically different in terms of their promises and their stances on the European
*14:37.740- 14:45.660* :  Union, Russia and Kosovo. Guided only in Belgrade. It was a significant day at one of the most
*14:45.660- 14:50.240* :  revered landmarks in the French capital Paris, more than four and a half years after the fire that
*14:50.240- 14:56.680* :  ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral. Gleaming Golden Rooster, where the vein has been fixed to the top
*14:56.680- 15:01.460* :  of the new spire, as experts continue their painstaking repair and restoration of the building,
*15:01.460- 15:09.120* :  which is around 800 years old. Here's Wendy Erker. In April 2019, a huge blaze at Notre Dame
*15:09.120- 15:16.120* :  Cathedral destroyed precious sculptures, artifacts and paintings and sent the spire crashing through
*15:16.120- 15:22.320* :  the roof of the church. The rooster that stood at the top of it was later found in the debris damaged
*15:22.320- 15:29.580* :  beyond repair. On Saturday, a new rooster made from Golden Copper and designed by Chief Architect
*15:29.580- 15:36.160* :  Philippe Villeneuve was blessed by the Archbishop of Paris. Sacred relics were placed inside the
*15:36.160- 15:42.100* :  sculpture, including what's believed to be fragments of Christ's crown of thorns before it was
*15:42.100- 15:47.720* :  carefully hoisted to the top of the new spire. The man in charge of Notre Dame's restoration
*15:47.780- 15:58.080* :  Philippe Just says it was a symbolic moment. The rooster means we're right at the end of the
*15:58.080- 16:04.600* :  rebuilding of the spire. It's 96 metres tall and once the roofers have covered the spire,
*16:04.860- 16:10.420* :  we'll be able to take the scaffolding off and that's when Parisians and everyone who walks past
*16:10.420- 16:17.520* :  will be able to see this flamboyant rooster. Notre Dame or our Lady of Paris is one of the city's
*16:17.520- 16:25.460* :  most iconic buildings. Construction was completed in 1260, but parts of the building date back to 1163.
*16:26.200- 16:30.940* :  For the last four years, dozens of sculptors have been remaking and restoring
*16:30.940- 16:37.760* :  gargoyles, religious icons, ornaments and foliage for the rose window and facade of the church.
*16:38.640- 16:44.640* :  Philippe Just says great care has been taken to protect the cathedral from fire in the future.
*16:46.660- 16:53.340* :  We've deployed a number of fire safety devices, some of which are really innovative for a cathedral,
*16:53.340- 17:00.300* :  including mist sprinklers under the roof, in the oak structure and in the spire. It's a first for
*17:00.300- 17:06.320* :  a cathedral in France. Pope Francis and other dignitaries are expected to be invited to the re-opening
*17:06.320- 17:12.200* :  of Notre Dame Cathedral, which is scheduled to take place in December next year. Wendy Erkert,
*17:12.200- 17:20.260* :  with that report. Still to come, Suez dominates in the processing of the precious gems with an estimated
*17:20.260- 17:25.760* :  90% of the world's rough diamonds cut and polished there before being sold on to global buyers.
*17:25.760- 17:32.340* :  India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has officially opened a huge new diamond exchange in the Western

*19:14.700- 19:19.320* :  The Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya are embroiled in a diplomatic row.
*19:19.320- 19:25.320* :  It all kicked off when a DRC opposition figure used the Kenyan capital Nairobi to announce he
*19:25.320- 19:30.500* :  was forming an alliance of rebel groups. The DRC government recalled its ambassador and accused
*19:30.500- 19:36.320* :  Kenya of hosting subversive activities. Africa, regional editor Will Ross told me more.
*19:43.940- 19:51.960* :  During the last election in 2018, and it seems he then had a fall out and left the country,
*19:51.960- 20:00.140* :  went into exile, and then suddenly he's popped up in a hotel in Kenya alongside the leader of
*20:00.140- 20:06.960* :  a well-known rebel group based in eastern Congo called the M23, and he's announced that he's
*20:06.960- 20:14.480* :  launching what he calls a political military coalition. He's called it the Congo River Alliance,
*20:14.480- 20:20.380* :  and he says that he's managed to get together a number of armed groups, including the M23,
*20:20.420- 20:27.160* :  as well as some civil society groups and other politicians, to basically oppose President
*20:27.160- 20:32.160* :  Felix Chisholkadi. And the reason he says he's doing it is because over the last few decades,
*20:32.180- 20:39.220* :  the governments in Kinshasa have failed to bring peace to the east. But quite what his game
*20:39.220- 20:44.520* :  is and why he's done this now, we don't know at the moment. What's Kenya had to say about all this?
*20:45.040- 20:51.040* :  Well, Kenya has basically tried to distance itself from the fact that this took place at press
*20:51.040- 20:57.180* :  conference in a hotel in Nairobi, because it is somewhat embarrassing that these figures were
*20:57.180- 21:02.400* :  able to stand up and announce this rebellion, as it were. And the Kenyan foreign minister,
*21:02.820- 21:09.040* :  Mussalia Mudavadi, has sort of said, we are still a peaceful country, they describe Congo as a
*21:09.040- 21:14.820* :  friendly nation, and said that they'll investigate it, but saying that we do not have to verify
*21:15.060- 21:22.160* :  who the media goes and talks to in our country. But that was in response to a very angry reaction
*21:22.160- 21:27.960* :  from the Kinshasa government, which is really pointing the finger at Kenya and saying why on earth
*21:27.960- 21:33.880* :  are these rebels allowed to stand up and launch this project from Kenyan soil?
*21:34.240- 21:37.180* :  I have to say the timing is pretty interesting for this intervention, isn't it?
*21:37.300- 21:43.280* :  It is coming just days ahead of the elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The last thing
*21:43.280- 21:48.360* :  that the country needs at the moment is further instability in the east. You've already got dozens
*21:48.360- 21:56.200* :  of armed groups, including the M23, which Kinshasa says is backed by Rwanda, even though Kagali denies it.
*21:56.980- 22:03.160* :  There is a real danger of the whole election being undermined by instability in the east,
*22:03.160- 22:09.260* :  and it seems that Mr Nunga is trying to kind of stir things up with this coalition just ahead of
*22:09.260- 22:15.500* :  the election. Will Ross, the man who has come to symbolize resistance to China's crushing
*22:15.500- 22:21.620* :  repression of democracy in Hong Kong, goes on trial on Monday again. The newspaper owner and
*22:21.620- 22:27.640* :  activist Jimmy Lai has been charged with colluding with foreign forces to undermine China's national
*22:27.640- 22:34.800* :  security. More details from Mickey Bristo. I come here with one borrow. I got everything I'd have
*22:35.080- 22:41.460* :  because of this price. This is Jimmy Lai speaking while he was still free of the debt he owes Hong
*22:41.460- 22:48.140* :  Kong, where he was able to close an empire from nothing and became a rich man. If this is the payback
*22:48.180- 22:55.300* :  towning, this is my weed redemption. If I'm in jail, I'm living my life, running for this.
*22:56.140- 23:02.280* :  He was arrested shortly after uttering these words. His trial, the most important since China's
*23:02.280- 23:07.960* :  snuffed out dissenting Hong Kong, will determine the cost of that redemption he spoke of.
*23:11.480- 23:16.160* :  Jimmy Lai was taken away from the offices of his Apple Daily newspaper just months after
*23:16.160- 23:21.800* :  China imposed a national security law in Hong Kong in 2020. It wasn't a surprise.
*23:25.800- 23:31.200* :  He become a prominent campaigner at pro-democracy protests and his newspaper constantly took
*23:31.200- 23:36.800* :  aim at Beijing's communist leaders. Jimmy Lai has been accused of colluding with foreign forces
*23:36.800- 23:42.200* :  against China. The articles he printed form the basis of the charges against him.
*23:43.020- 23:48.980* :  In one of his last interviews before his detention, he told the BBC why he decided to take on the
*23:48.980- 23:56.120* :  men who ruled China. You know, if they can induce fear in you, that's the easiest way to control
*23:56.120- 24:01.980* :  you. There's the cheapest way to control you and the most effectively and they know it and they're
*24:01.980- 24:07.100* :  very, you know, they're very good at it. Jimmy Lai has already been in prison for three years,
*24:07.600- 24:13.520* :  waiting for this trial to start. He's held in solitary confinement and allowed outside to exercise
*24:13.520- 24:20.780* :  for just 50 minutes a day. His son Sebastian, who lives outside Hong Kong, was shocked when he saw
*24:20.780- 24:27.040* :  recent snatched photographs of his father. He was skinnier at DACA, led around by two men,
*24:27.900- 24:31.720* :  and it's just a reminder that he's 76 and he's been in solitary confinement for three years.
*24:32.380- 24:36.120* :  It was pretty heartbreaking, but it was also the first time I saw him in three years,
*24:36.840- 24:40.760* :  so in that sense it was a bit of sweet. I think anybody who sees a picture of their parents
*24:41.340- 24:47.040* :  feels a bit of happiness. Jimmy Lai is pleading not guilty, but no one believes he'll win
*24:47.100- 24:53.060* :  as his son made clear when asked of his feelings about the trial. I'm reflexively anxious,
*24:53.880- 24:58.380* :  but there's actually no anxiety involved once you think about it because it's a complete
*24:58.380- 25:04.440* :  show trial. The result is already pretty determined. It's a trial with three government appointed
*25:04.440- 25:11.000* :  judges, no jury, and the security minister recently boasted a hundred percent conviction rate.
*25:15.240- 25:19.020* :  China says the charges against Jimmy Lai are simply about to uphold in the law,
*25:19.760- 25:24.580* :  but the authorities in Hong Kong appear nervous about the trial, which has been delayed on a
*25:24.580- 25:33.040* :  number of occasions already. This is Hong Kong's security chief, Chris Tan,
*25:33.660- 25:38.760* :  wanting anyone attending court not to disrupt the proceedings, which will be watched closely
*25:38.760- 25:48.360* :  around the world. Just a few years ago, Hong Kong was convulsed by pro-democracy protests.
*25:49.240- 25:55.920* :  But China has now crushed all anti-government activism. The verdict in the trial of Jimmy Lai
*25:56.520- 26:00.180* :  will show the world just who now controls Hong Kong.
*26:03.340- 26:03.980* :  Mickey Bristo
*26:04.960- 26:09.520* :  India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has officially opened a huge new diamond exchange
*26:09.520- 26:14.640* :  in the western city of Surat. The complex will contain a state-of-the-art customs facility,
*26:14.640- 26:19.100* :  retail space, and vaults for international banking. Here's Electronics Smith.
*26:19.560- 26:24.480* :  The boss in Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat is housed in what said to be the world's largest
*26:24.480- 26:30.260* :  office complex. It aims to centralise the industry under one roof, cementing Surat as the world's
*26:30.260- 26:36.140* :  diamond capital. One Mumbai has long been an export centre for diamonds in India, Surat dominates
*26:36.140- 26:41.020* :  in the processing of the precious gems, with an estimated 90 percent of the world's rough diamonds
*26:41.020- 26:44.320* :  cut and polished there before being sold on to global buyers.
*26:45.000- 26:50.820* :  Next to Scotland and Britain's most northerly inhabited island is a step closer to becoming
*26:50.820- 26:56.320* :  the heart of the UK's space industry. The Civil Aviation Authority has granted a license
*26:56.320- 27:03.160* :  for vertical rocket launches at the Saxervauds' spaceport on the island of Ernst. BBC Scotland's
*27:03.160- 27:09.740* :  science correspondent Laura Goodwin has more. Ernst and the Shetland Isles, home to around 700
*27:09.740- 27:16.220* :  people and now the UK's first license spaceport for vertical launches. Construction has been
*27:16.220- 27:22.540* :  underway for some time. One of three huge launch pads is already built, but getting the green light
*27:22.540- 27:28.800* :  from the regulators is a huge moment. Here's Debbie Strang, Saxervaud's spaceport co-founder.
*27:29.040- 27:33.140* :  Disbelief in a way that it's finally come through because we've been waiting for it for so long
*27:33.140- 27:39.860* :  that it has been such a journey and so yet to finally have it, it is a huge sense of relief.
*27:39.860- 27:45.940* :  The license allows up to 30 launches a year with rockets taking small satellites into space.
*27:45.940- 27:51.560* :  Here's Frank Strang from Saxervauds' spaceport. That's probably twice as many as in the other
*27:51.560- 27:58.620* :  prospective spaceport in Europe and it's certainly over three times as many as some of the spaceports
*27:58.620- 28:03.760* :  in the U.S. So it gives us a real fighting chance at building a sustainable business.
*28:04.080- 28:09.800* :  The CAA say rigorous safety and environmental conditions were a key part of their approval.
*28:09.860- 28:15.680* :  Suborbital launches will begin next year with full launches planned for 2025.
*28:15.780- 28:21.460* :  Laura Goodwin, if you were looking for somewhere to stage a music festival then Tim Butsu
*28:21.460- 28:27.320* :  might be among the last places most would choose as well as being deep in the desert of Marley.
*28:27.700- 28:31.680* :  It's been blockaded since August by militants from an affiliate of al-Qaeda,
*28:31.680- 28:36.740* :  getting water and food in has been difficult and security has been made even worse since the
*28:36.740- 28:43.540* :  U.N. peacekeeping mission left the country. But as Sara Mineta now reports, for many reasons the show has gone on.
*28:48.740- 28:53.920* :  In the ivory shadow of the monument of the peace in Tim Butsu musicians coming from all over
*28:53.920- 29:01.200* :  the country take the stage as the sun sets on the sun-colored houses of the historical city in the desert.
*29:07.320- 29:12.920* :  Thousands of local traders and artisans showcase their products in a colorful row of stands.
*29:15.260- 29:20.380* :  It would seem this edition of the festival is no different from previous years but that is not
*29:20.380- 29:26.840* :  the case. Since late August Tim Butsu has been under blockade by the geodist group Jenem.
*29:27.080- 29:30.240* :  The villages just outside the city have become a battleground.
*29:31.960- 29:37.680* :  The festival was born in the community as a response to the tensions and the difficulties to promote life.
*29:38.420- 29:44.020* :  Salah Maiga is the director of the festival and a member of the National Transitional Council,
*29:44.020- 29:49.620* :  Mali's Interim Parliament. I ask him why he decided to carry on with the event this year.
*29:53.560- 29:58.480* :  Now it's needed more than ever because it's something to help people lift their spirits and
*29:58.480- 30:04.720* :  it brings a lot of support to the local economy. This year we haven't even bigger attendance than in
*30:04.720- 30:13.540* :  the past because since September there's been a stop to normal life. Over 136,000 people live in the
*30:13.540- 30:19.620* :  city about half of them are children. They have endured months of sporadic access to supplies
*30:20.300- 30:26.020* :  for them petrol prices have skyrocketed and there's been a growing number of attacks on civilians.
*30:26.020- 30:32.240* :  The most shocking one in September on a river boat crammed with people trying to live the city.
*30:32.840- 30:38.100* :  49 were killed. We have to reduce our movement. We have to reduce the exposure of the team we have.
*30:38.100- 30:44.280* :  Isami Abdul is from Madassan San Frontier. He is worried the blockade is preventing them from helping
*30:44.280- 30:50.460* :  those in need. The second concern is the access of the population and the patient to health care
*30:50.460- 30:56.200* :  structures because due to years of ongoing conflict the health care access remains already an issue.
*30:58.600- 31:02.860* :  In 2012 this region was at the centre of a Tuarex separatist rebellion.
*31:03.460- 31:08.080* :  Geodist militants affiliated to Al-Qaeda also fought against the central government
*31:08.080- 31:14.620* :  behind for control of Northern Mali. French troops were deployed here for a counterterrorism
*31:14.620- 31:20.540* :  operation and a UN peacekeeping mission Minusma was also established. But when the military
*31:20.540- 31:26.140* :  junta took power with a coup three years ago they made it clear these troops were no longer
*31:26.600- 31:29.680* :  welcome. They said they had failed in their objectives.
*31:32.620- 31:35.940* :  This week Minusma officially ended its mission in Mali.
*31:38.100- 31:42.420* :  But soon after the military bases in Timbuktu were handed over to the army,
*31:42.920- 31:48.060* :  militant groups launched their attacks. The Malian army has called the Indo-Russian Wagner group
*31:48.060- 31:54.560* :  to help fight the insurgents in the north but that has added to the distrust of some local communities.
*31:55.000- 32:02.000* :  The government is under pressure. They took a huge bet on forcing the UN forces out of the
*32:02.000- 32:08.520* :  country claiming they would be able to maintain security. Ulf Lessing has this a health program
*32:08.520- 32:14.200* :  at the Conrad Adanao Foundation, a German think tank. Despite all the fighting that's going on
*32:14.200- 32:19.700* :  the Malian government has decided to support the festival in Timbuktu, it even deployed the
*32:19.700- 32:23.800* :  military plane to transport logistics. Why do you think that is?
*32:24.260- 32:29.940* :  In Timbuktu, just rather symbolic, this festival gives them some kind of legitimacy, some kind of,
*32:29.940- 32:34.680* :  it gives a sense of normalcy that everything's under control. The government doesn't need the UN
*32:35.420- 32:38.160* :  and they're able to ensure the well-being of citizens.
*32:42.340- 32:47.720* :  Thanks to the intermediation of local community chiefs, Janem had agreed to ease the
*32:47.720- 32:53.280* :  blockade of Timbuktu and let food trucks in. But on the day of the inauguration of the festival,
*32:53.280- 32:59.340* :  the group issued a statement accusing the army of exploiting the lifting of the blockade
*32:59.820- 33:06.220* :  and saying it would reinstate it. On that day, a message Mr. Maiga to ask him if Janem's statement
*33:06.780- 33:08.340* :  changed his plans at all.
*33:10.140- 33:16.500* :  Our main goal is to fight for unity. We do all we can to facilitate dialogue and exchanges
*33:17.040- 33:23.000* :  and we continue to do it whatever the circumstances, whatever the challenges we show or resilience
*33:23.700- 33:25.280* :  as a steady and proud community.
*33:33.000- 33:37.740* :  That report from Sarah Maneta. Now with the Christmas upon us next week,
*33:37.740- 33:42.640* :  the threat of getting no presents from Santa Claus hovers over children right around the world,
*33:42.640- 33:49.180* :  encouraging good behaviour, but is it okay to use the so-called naughty list to keep children
*33:49.180- 33:51.980* :  in line? Stephanie Prentice has been investigating.
*33:55.000- 34:01.180* :  A time for giving and spending time with loved ones. Children all around the world are
*34:01.180- 34:07.240* :  gearing up for Christmas day and the prospect of presents. But the deal generally is that they
*34:07.240- 34:13.020* :  have to behave well to get a visit from Santa and if they're not good, the threat of getting
*34:13.020- 34:19.620* :  coal in their stocking. You don't always get the thing that you want, but he always gives you
*34:19.620- 34:28.640* :  presents if you're nice. So we've got a Santa camp in our classroom and my table is right next to it
*34:28.960- 34:32.680* :  so I have to be extra nice because he's got a really close eye on me.
*34:33.280- 34:38.380* :  So at Santa camp being used in that school as an all-seeing eye on children's behaviour
*34:38.920- 34:44.400* :  suggestive of a higher power and fitting for a Christian holiday. But is it right?
*34:44.500- 34:48.740* :  We went to the top and asked Reverend Cannon and East what she thought.
*34:49.240- 34:56.700* :  I think the whole message of Christmas is that God gives to everybody just because we're us
*34:57.380- 35:04.580* :  and I'd rather have carrot than stick and because you've been given presents you will want to give
*35:04.580- 35:10.020* :  other people presents. So is there any merit to the system where bad behaviour could result
*35:10.020- 35:17.380* :  in no presents or the dreaded coal? Children need to understand that if you make the wrong
*35:17.380- 35:26.700* :  choice negative things do happen but I think I'd rather emphasise the positive. I mean if you have
*35:26.700- 35:35.100* :  to have a mock camera okay but let's say we're looking for good works. We're looking for generosity
*35:35.100- 35:42.080* :  and kindness and friendliness. Generosity, kindness and friendliness good to aim for at any time of
*35:42.260- 35:48.040* :  year and for children in the next couple of weeks it certainly can't hurt to be more nice than naughty.
*35:49.660- 35:51.660* :  That report by Stephanie Prentice.
*35:54.120- 35:59.320* :  And that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
