*01:18.760- 01:24.380* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 14th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:24.980- 01:31.360* :  An EU summit is divided over Ukraine between 26 member states and Victor Orban, the Hungarian Prime
*01:31.360- 01:37.540* :  Minister. A senior US official arrives in Israel amid mounting criticism of the bombing of Gaza.
*01:38.080- 01:43.860* :  President Putin resumes his annual press conference and talks at length about Ukraine and the West.
*01:46.700- 01:51.840* :  Also in this podcast Afghan families cross 11 countries to get to the US.
*01:52.160- 01:59.020* :  When we were crossing we saw many dead bodies. That was the most tragic part of the travel.
*01:59.580- 02:02.140* :  And the men who shot the US national symbol.
*02:05.620- 02:09.900* :  We begin in Brussels where the stage is set for a showdown at the EU summit,
*02:10.440- 02:15.480* :  with 26 member states in favor of aid to Ukraine and talks to start accession proceedings
*02:15.480- 02:21.620* :  and one against the Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban. He has retained his stance despite
*02:21.620- 02:27.800* :  what one MP described as the biggest bribe in EU history from the European Commission to Hungary
*02:27.800- 02:32.340* :  last night. Victor Orban showed his skepticism on the way into the summit.
*02:47.080- 02:51.080* :  Also speaking on arrival Lithuania's president Kitana Nasada,
*02:51.500- 02:53.620* :  he should have started warning to the Hungarians.
*03:08.700- 03:14.820* :  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said that Putin would try to exploit the summit's failure,
*03:15.320- 03:19.180* :  arguing that now is not the time for half measures or hesitation.
*03:19.940- 03:23.860* :  I spoke to our Europe regional editor Danny Aberhard, who's in Brussels.
*03:45.120- 03:50.860* :  The European Union, Gazette Borrell, said that this is an existential issue for Europe.
*03:50.980- 03:55.940* :  It's not just about Ukraine's security, but why do European security as well?
*03:55.940- 04:00.500* :  And the Estonian Prime Minister Kaya Kalas, she said she wasn't optimistic.
*04:00.580- 04:02.740* :  She hopes for some agreement on some points.
*04:03.240- 04:07.980* :  Because at the moment Rachel, Mr Orban is saying he isn't going to change stance.
*04:08.000- 04:12.280* :  And we wait to see whether that shifts in the day. He's coming under a lot of pressure.
*04:12.680- 04:16.060* :  He's been meeting President Macron of France, Chancellor Schultz of Germany,
*04:16.060- 04:19.660* :  and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, before the talks even begin.
*04:20.080- 04:24.640* :  And remind me what has been described as the biggest bribe in EU history.
*04:24.640- 04:26.020* :  Remind me what that was.
*04:26.520- 04:34.900* :  Well, that was a decision yesterday by the European Commission to free up $11 billion of frozen
*04:34.900- 04:39.520* :  funds. These were funds that were frozen in a long-running dispute between the Commission and
*04:39.520- 04:41.860* :  Hungary on issues such as the rule of law.
*04:42.420- 04:48.920* :  Now, the Commission says that the timing of this, which does look very suspicious,
*04:49.520- 04:53.560* :  isn't anything to do with the actual decision itself that Hungary had passed a series of
*04:53.920- 05:00.300* :  legislation reforms to change some of the issues that the Commission had with the rule of
*05:00.300- 05:02.240* :  law in terms of protecting traditional independence.
*05:02.780- 05:05.220* :  And that the funds are being freed up because of that.
*05:05.220- 05:08.980* :  But obviously not a lot of people are swallowing that on some quarters.
*05:09.660- 05:13.000* :  The quote about the biggest bribe in EU history was from a German green
*05:13.840- 05:15.660* :  MEP, and he is not the only one.
*05:15.960- 05:19.340* :  The money doesn't come in one big block.
*05:19.340- 05:23.000* :  It would, Hungary would still need to apply for it in pieces.
*05:23.000- 05:24.720* :  And there are still conditions attached.
*05:25.280- 05:29.540* :  Whether it shifts prime minister Orban's thinking on Ukraine or not.
*05:29.540- 05:31.920* :  He's shown no indication of that up to this point.
*05:32.640- 05:35.040* :  Our regional editor, Danny Eberhard.
*05:35.580- 05:40.240* :  To Moscow now, where President Putin has been speaking at his end of your news conference,
*05:40.240- 05:45.040* :  his first since Russia invaded Ukraine because last year's event was cancelled.
*05:45.740- 05:50.400* :  In a lengthy interview, the Russian leader insisted the army would continue with its war in Ukraine,
*05:50.920- 05:54.540* :  and that there wouldn't be peace until Moscow has achieved its goals.
*05:55.340- 05:58.920* :  He painted a positive picture of Russian advances on the battlefield,
*05:59.740- 06:04.040* :  responding to a question Mr. Putin also addressed the question of peace in Ukraine.
*06:07.540- 06:10.960* :  There will be peace when we achieve our goals, which you've just spoken about.
*06:11.640- 06:14.620* :  Now, let's return to those goals. They do not change.
*06:14.620- 06:17.200* :  I'll remind you what we spoke about back then.
*06:17.760- 06:23.900* :  About the denazification of Ukraine, about its demilitarization, about its neutral status.
*06:24.700- 06:27.980* :  All main Russian TV channels are carrying the press conference.
*06:27.980- 06:30.060* :  It usually lasts around four hours.
*06:30.680- 06:35.140* :  Our Russian analyst, Fatali Shevchenko, has been following the story and gave me a flavour
*06:35.140- 06:37.100* :  of what Mr. Putin has been saying.
*06:37.760- 06:43.960* :  It's noteworthy, I think, that he has been heavily focused on Ukraine,
*06:44.840- 06:48.600* :  and what he actually said was not that unusual.
*06:48.600- 06:52.660* :  He defended his so-called special military operation against Ukraine.
*06:53.820- 06:59.540* :  He painted a very rosy picture of how things were going for his troops in Ukraine.
*06:59.540- 07:04.300* :  He said the situation for them was improving while for the Ukrainians.
*07:04.420- 07:06.100* :  It was a tragedy.
*07:06.300- 07:09.740* :  He sounded as defined as ever.
*07:09.740- 07:11.940* :  He said Russian objectives in Ukraine.
*07:11.940- 07:13.160* :  They remained in place.
*07:13.180- 07:17.560* :  The militarising, the notifying Ukraine, quote-unquote,
*07:18.240- 07:21.360* :  and making sure Ukraine never joined NATO.
*07:22.040- 07:30.740* :  And, upsettingly, for Ukrainians, yet again, he questioned Ukraine's very national identity
*07:30.740- 07:34.540* :  by saying that Ukrainians and Russians are one of the same people.
*07:35.600- 07:39.280* :  And he questioned Ukraine's territorial integrity as well,
*07:39.280- 07:45.040* :  by saying that huge ways of Southeast Ukraine actually belonged to Russia.
*07:45.040- 07:47.680* :  So, from that point of view, nothing new there.
*07:48.320- 07:50.920* :  Of course, the news conference didn't happen last year.
*07:50.920- 07:54.340* :  Is the fact that it's happened this year a sign of real confidence?
*07:55.180- 07:57.100* :  I think there are two main reasons for it.
*07:57.380- 08:01.380* :  One, as you say, is, of course, last year it was becoming clear that
*08:02.160- 08:06.660* :  his special military operation against Ukraine wasn't really going to plan.
*08:07.220- 08:12.440* :  And also, secondly, if he were not be holding it now,
*08:12.880- 08:15.700* :  that would have raised so many questions,
*08:16.820- 08:24.480* :  these Q&As, they're such a firm part of the Putin narrative, if you like.
*08:24.480- 08:26.700* :  This is what he normally does annually.
*08:27.340- 08:32.080* :  To give it a miss, two years in the row, that would have been a big deal.
*08:32.660- 08:34.500* :  Of course, an election is coming next year.
*08:34.500- 08:36.780* :  Are we getting a sense of what he's campaigning on?
*08:37.780- 08:45.160* :  It's probably what is his same platform that he offered to Russians
*08:45.160- 08:51.960* :  for more than 20 years of being in charge of Russia, which is so firmly based on this idea
*08:51.960- 08:59.500* :  that Russia is locked in a centuries-long fight against the evil, scheming West,
*08:59.720- 09:03.280* :  and it has to defend itself in Ukraine.
*09:03.280- 09:09.220* :  And this focus on foreign policy in his platform is also reflected in today's Q&A,
*09:09.220- 09:13.280* :  because most of it has been about foreign policy.
*09:14.000- 09:19.200* :  Vitaly Shavchenko, when the Taliban captured Kabul more than two years ago,
*09:19.200- 09:23.680* :  tens of thousands of Afghans were evacuated by the U.S. for their own safety,
*09:23.680- 09:28.920* :  but many were left behind and are taking a much riskier journey to the United States.
*09:29.620- 09:33.980* :  The BBC's Reagan Morris traveled to Tirwana on the U.S.-Mexico border,
*09:34.460- 09:38.380* :  where Afghans have been arriving in record numbers since 2021.
*09:39.600- 09:46.680* :  The Korean cries as she shows me footage of her journey across 11 countries to get from Afghanistan
*09:46.700- 09:50.700* :  to Mexico. Your leg is gashed from the jungle.
*09:51.580- 09:54.420* :  The photos show cuts they got from walking through rough terrain.
*09:55.400- 09:57.540* :  Some shows a young family sleeping on the streets,
*09:58.460- 10:00.920* :  torrential rain and Panama as they climb a mountain,
*10:01.940- 10:04.740* :  and then she shows me a close-up of her daughter's faith.
*10:04.940- 10:07.860* :  So they punched your nine-year-old daughter to get money.
*10:09.240- 10:13.740* :  Her eye bruised black and blue, Shukriya says armed gunmen made the men and women
*10:13.740- 10:17.200* :  stripped naked to search for money. Then they beat the children.
*10:19.240- 10:22.940* :  Fight was over money. They surrounded us and took what they wanted.
*10:23.640- 10:25.080* :  She says they're all traumatized.
*10:28.540- 10:31.660* :  Many migrants hire smugglers to cross the Darian gap in Panama,
*10:32.260- 10:36.060* :  but Shukriya and other Afghans relied on directions they found on social media.
*10:36.980- 10:41.280* :  And they just followed the crowd. Thousands of people now pass daily through the jungle,
*10:41.280- 10:43.340* :  which was once considered impassable.
*10:43.680- 10:46.360* :  When we were crossing, we saw many dead bodies.
*10:47.460- 10:51.360* :  That was the most tragic part of the travel.
*10:51.680- 10:54.620* :  Sophia was a student at the American University in Kabul,
*10:55.120- 10:58.480* :  which made her eligible for a U.S. evacuation flight in 2021.
*10:59.880- 11:03.700* :  But in all the chaos, she couldn't get through the crowds, which mobbed the airport.
*11:04.420- 11:06.060* :  We were left behind, and then the U.S.
*11:06.700- 11:08.880* :  NBC told us that you can go to Pakistan and
*11:10.120- 11:13.440* :  fill a form, and we will process your case.
*11:13.940- 11:15.740* :  But we stayed more than a year in the Pakistan.
*11:16.740- 11:18.820* :  But still our case was not getting processed.
*11:19.180- 11:24.600* :  The Latina Muslim Foundation opened the shelter in 2022 to give the growing number of Muslim migrants
*11:24.600- 11:26.640* :  in Tijuana a place where they could pray,
*11:27.160- 11:31.440* :  and eat halal food, and sleep safely in separate men's and women's dormitories.
*11:33.080- 11:35.500* :  Outside the shelter, you can see the border wall.
*11:35.580- 11:37.300* :  We are like a stone's throw away.
*11:38.180- 11:43.840* :  And these Afghans and others we spoke to inside, they can't really do much,
*11:43.840- 11:47.340* :  but stay within the confines of that shelter because they don't feel safe outside.
*11:47.500- 11:48.600* :  They're afraid they'll get arrested.
*11:50.020- 11:54.140* :  So they stay inside waiting and waiting for an asylum appointment.
*11:55.240- 11:59.580* :  They try every day to use the U.S. government's new CBP1 app
*11:59.980- 12:01.580* :  to get an appointment to claim asylum.
*12:01.900- 12:05.440* :  The app was meant to simplify the process, but it hasn't.
*12:05.900- 12:10.800* :  Some people get an appointment right away, others say it just glitches and crashes all the time,
*12:10.800- 12:12.420* :  some wait weeks or months.
*12:12.800- 12:16.580* :  And that's why they, when they don't have any other options,
*12:16.580- 12:19.540* :  they have to cross legally to U.S.
*12:20.100- 12:21.000* :  How long have you been here?
*12:21.600- 12:24.100* :  I have been here more than two months.
*12:24.940- 12:28.340* :  Even if they do make it to the United States, their future is uncertain.
*12:29.060- 12:32.860* :  The Afghan Adjustment Act, the legislation proposed by the Biden administration
*12:32.920- 12:37.820* :  to grant permanent residency for many Afghan refugees, is stalled in the U.S. Congress.
*12:38.640- 12:42.500* :  And with lawmakers debating ways to make claiming asylum much more difficult,
*12:42.980- 12:44.660* :  their journey is far from over.
*12:45.580- 12:48.240* :  Reagan Morris, and if you want to hear more about this story,
*12:48.240- 12:50.920* :  go to today's The Global Story Podcast,
*12:50.920- 12:54.700* :  why are Afghan refugees stuck on the U.S.-Mexico border,
*12:55.160- 12:56.660* :  wherever you get your podcasts?
*12:57.900- 13:01.580* :  Good today be the beginning of a new phase in the war in Gaza.
*13:02.080- 13:07.480* :  The U.S. President Joe Biden has indicated that Israel is losing global support for its war
*13:07.480- 13:13.280* :  against Hamas and is sending his national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, to Israel today for talks.
*13:14.000- 13:15.480* :  But those talks will be tricky.
*13:15.480- 13:19.640* :  On Wednesday, Israel's Foreign Minister declared the war against Hamas
*13:20.020- 13:22.900* :  would continue with or without international support.
*13:22.940- 13:28.680* :  Sharon Haskell is a member of the Israeli Parliament for the Conservative National Unity Party.
*13:29.280- 13:34.640* :  She told the BBC it was essential for Israel to stick to its aim of eradicating Hamas.
*13:35.480- 13:39.940* :  Their leadership have said time and time again that they will always
*13:39.940- 13:43.860* :  persecute the Jews and try to murder them if they have any kind of opportunity.
*13:43.860- 13:49.580* :  They will try to do the massacre that they did on the 7th of October over and over again.
*13:50.420- 13:54.900* :  And so this war is an actual war on humanity.
*13:55.620- 13:59.740* :  I mean, this is the only way that we can defend our children.
*14:00.500- 14:03.980* :  Our Jerusalem correspondent Yalan Nell told us more about the visit.
*14:04.600- 14:08.880* :  He said to be coming here to urge the Israelis to be more surgical and precise with their strikes
*14:08.880- 14:11.900* :  against Hamas targets in Gaza, first of all.
*14:11.900- 14:17.140* :  Of course, we've had the criticism from Joe Biden this week when the President has said that
*14:17.140- 14:22.140* :  Israel's indiscriminate bombardment in Gaza is leading to a loss of global support.
*14:22.660- 14:27.580* :  And we're also seeing in the Israeli media that there's a possible talk of another pause
*14:27.580- 14:30.000* :  in fighting to allow hostages to be released.
*14:31.700- 14:36.780* :  Mr Sullivan will also be talking about ways to speed up the flow of aid and the distribution
*14:36.780- 14:41.860* :  of aid into Gaza. And we're hearing also that he'll discuss with the war cabinet in Israel
*14:41.860- 14:45.300* :  a timetable to end the war, a vision for Gaza after the war.
*14:45.660- 14:49.920* :  And these areas where there are serious disagreements between Israel and the US,
*14:49.920- 14:54.040* :  its closest ally, an ally which gives billions of dollars in military support.
*14:54.040- 14:58.500* :  And also acts, of course, as a diplomatic shield for Israel, especially at the UN,
*14:58.500- 15:03.180* :  where this week we've seen overwhelming support at the General Assembly for a ceasefire.
*15:03.320- 15:05.760* :  So possibly a new phase of the war?
*15:06.060- 15:10.180* :  I mean, it's difficult to stay exactly at this stage, but I think time is running out for this
*15:10.180- 15:16.680* :  very intense stage of the war where we're seeing Israeli ground forces deep inside Gaza and
*15:16.680- 15:23.060* :  continuing bombardment of the Gaza Strip with the media in Gaza. Hamas controlled media talking
*15:23.060- 15:28.640* :  about how 24 people were killed in an Israeli strike that hit two houses in Raffa in the very south
*15:28.780- 15:34.880* :  of the territory. For example, we don't have immediate confirmation of the numbers of people
*15:34.880- 15:39.900* :  killed in the latest strikes. Certainly, there has been a lot of speculation in the Israeli media
*15:39.900- 15:44.760* :  in recent days that this stage of the war could be ended more quickly due to international
*15:44.760- 15:48.980* :  pressure than perhaps Israeli military commanders would like. Ideally, we're told that they would
*15:48.980- 15:54.340* :  like to continue through into January with this intensity of the war before pulling back
*15:54.380- 15:59.740* :  some of their soldiers where they have at the moment they have seen several army divisions
*15:59.740- 16:04.560* :  deep inside the Gaza Strip. They would pull them out towards the edge of the Gaza Strip
*16:04.560- 16:09.440* :  to the buffer zone. I mean, what's really a great problem for Israel at the moment? It really
*16:09.440- 16:14.240* :  wants to show that it has delivered a victory over Hamas, and still there are very senior leaders,
*16:14.240- 16:19.880* :  the likes of Yahya Sinwa, the Hamas leader in Gaza. His whereabouts exactly unknown. He thought
*16:19.880- 16:25.000* :  he could be in Han Unis, which has been so much a focus of the southern offensive, but Israel
*16:25.000- 16:31.920* :  has not at this stage got any evidence that it has managed to capture or kill those very senior
*16:31.920- 16:36.100* :  people that it holds as being the masterminds of the 7th of October attacks in which, of course,
*16:36.100- 16:41.020* :  more than 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel. Those cross-border attacks by
*16:41.020- 16:47.480* :  thousands of Hamas fighters that led to Israel's deadliest day in its 75-year history.
*16:47.480- 16:54.260* :  Yuland Nell in Jerusalem. 950 billion tons. That's what scientists
*16:54.260- 16:59.460* :  monitoring the world's biggest icebergs say. It weighs. They worked it out using satellite
*16:59.460- 17:04.920* :  measurements, and as our science correspondent, Jonathan Amos reports, it used to be even bigger.
*17:05.780- 17:11.820* :  Imagine a field of ice more than twice the area of Greater London, but as thick as its skyscrapers
*17:11.820- 17:18.440* :  at all. This is a 23A, current title holder of the world's biggest iceberg. Scientists have
*17:18.440- 17:23.780* :  used radar pulses from a European Space Agency satellite to essentially take a tape measure
*17:23.780- 17:29.380* :  to the colossus. The researchers from the UK Centre for Polar Observation and Modeling say the
*17:29.380- 17:35.760* :  bug has lost quite a bit of mass since breaking away from the Antarctic coast in 1986, but it still
*17:35.760- 17:42.920* :  tips the scales at 950 billion tons. As A23A moves north and warms in the coming weeks,
*17:42.920- 17:48.200* :  its melt rate will accelerate, and it will be dumping more fresh water into the ocean daily
*17:48.200- 17:52.440* :  than is consumed by the entire UK population. Jonathan Amos.
*17:55.120- 17:59.820* :  Coming up on the global news podcast, a stark increase in road deaths in Africa.
*18:00.340- 18:05.540* :  I'm standing on Ginger Road, the intersection of the gateway into the city centre.
*18:06.000- 18:11.280* :  One of the areas which the city authorities have listed as one of the black spots.
*18:11.740- 18:12.520* :  We ask why.
*18:18.480- 18:24.260* :  County Mayo's Gaelic football team haven't won an all-Irland championship since 1951.
*18:24.480- 18:29.860* :  Mayo got the final so many times. We get this for every year and we just can't get over the last
*18:29.940- 18:36.280* :  step. And tales of a priest's curse abound. There's a long kill worth of excuses. I put it down to
*18:36.280- 18:41.760* :  the curse, spend the only explanation. Amazing sport stories investigates the curse of County Mayo.
*18:41.760- 18:47.280* :  I seen it firsthand. Listen now by searching for amazing sport stories wherever you get your BBC
*18:47.280- 18:55.900* :  podcasts. Welcome back. The US House of Representatives has voted to formalise its impeachment inquiry
*18:55.900- 19:02.260* :  into President Joe Biden, as you may have heard in our last podcast, but the case really concerns
*19:02.260- 19:06.560* :  the president's son Hunter Biden, who has accused of bribery and corruption.
*19:06.560- 19:12.620* :  It's the story that President Biden just can't shake off. He's dismissed the inquiry as a stunt
*19:12.620- 19:18.360* :  and said time would be better spent in Congress addressing military funding for Ukraine and Israel.
*19:18.360- 19:24.460* :  David Willis in Washington gave us this update. Well House Republicans launched an informal
*19:24.460- 19:30.580* :  investigation into President Biden's business dealings about three months ago without a vote on
*19:30.580- 19:37.200* :  the matter. And so this vote formalises that inquiry has expected. It went very much along party
*19:37.200- 19:42.620* :  lines. Republicans voting in favour, Democrats voting against. And it gives House Republicans
*19:42.620- 19:49.160* :  greater powers to depose witnesses, to enforce subpoenas, gather evidence and so on,
*19:49.580- 19:54.900* :  including such evidence as bank records, text messages and email correspondence, mobile phone
*19:54.900- 20:00.880* :  records, and that sort of thing. Republicans have accused the president of benefiting financially
*20:00.880- 20:08.060* :  from his son Hunter's foreign business dealings during Biden's senior's time as vice president
*20:09.000- 20:14.500* :  during the Obama administration, of course. And that is something that both Joe and Hunter Biden
*20:14.500- 20:21.600* :  emphatically deny. Republicans have been looking into Hunter Biden's business dealings in China
*20:22.060- 20:29.040* :  and Ukraine amongst other places, but they've yet to uncover any evidence of bribery or corruption.
*20:29.040- 20:35.100* :  There is no chance of Joe Biden being removed from office because of this inquiry,
*20:35.100- 20:41.340* :  because as well as an impeachment conviction in the House, the U.S. Constitution requires
*20:41.340- 20:46.540* :  a two-thirds vote of the Senate, of course, to convict a president and remove him from office
*20:46.540- 20:50.920* :  and Democrats hold the majority in the Senate. So that's not going to happen. But what this does do
*20:51.440- 20:59.440* :  is it may well cause some Americans to question the morality of Joe Biden going into an election
*20:59.440- 21:04.780* :  year, an election year, which could see him, of course, going toe-to-toe with Donald Trump,
*21:04.780- 21:11.180* :  who is himself facing a whole raft of criminal charges. David Willis in Washington.
*21:11.940- 21:17.620* :  To Africa now, which has witnessed a stark increase in traffic-related deaths over the past decade,
*21:18.060- 21:23.480* :  up 17 percent, despite a global decline over the same period, according to the World Health
*21:23.480- 21:29.940* :  Organization. The fact is that more people now own cars in Africa, but the roads aren't that good.
*21:29.940- 21:34.500* :  So road traffic accidents are now the ninth leading cause of death on the continent.
*21:34.540- 21:40.580* :  Joe Walker is a Ugandan award-winning road safety advocate, looking to save lives through his
*21:40.580- 21:45.440* :  road safety awareness campaigns. Here's a clip he sent the BBC from Campala.
*21:46.540- 21:52.640* :  I'm standing right here on Ginger Road, the intersection of the gateway into the city center.
*21:53.520- 21:58.800* :  One of the areas which the city authorities have listed as one of the black spots.
*21:58.800- 22:04.340* :  What do I mean by the black spots? Where we've lost many people to road traffic crashes.
*22:04.460- 22:09.580* :  In Uganda, every day on average, we lose 12 to 14 people to road crashes.
*22:10.120- 22:16.340* :  And the majority of these, more than 80 percent of the victims are cyclists and pedestrians.
*22:16.340- 22:19.780* :  The cyclists, the majority of them are definitely border-border riders.
*22:19.780- 22:23.900* :  Border-bodas we have more than 20,000 border-bodas in Uganda.
*22:24.960- 22:30.440* :  And just to mention, border-bodas are motorbike taxis, which are a common sight and used by many
*22:30.440- 22:35.640* :  people across East Africa. Dr. Nantran is the leader of the World Health Organization's
*22:35.640- 22:41.260* :  Safety and Mobility Unit. The African continent actually saw was the only continent where there was
*22:41.260- 22:46.880* :  an increase overall in the number of road traffic deaths over the last 10 years. And the number of
*22:46.880- 22:51.100* :  these increases have been quite important. What I do want to highlight is that there actually
*22:51.100- 22:55.860* :  were countries in the region that managed to reduce their number of fatalities. And so when we
*22:55.860- 23:00.480* :  talk about the 17 percent, we're talking about an overall average for the continent. But I do
*23:00.480- 23:05.060* :  want to mention that there were countries, for example, Congo, Burundi and Rwanda,
*23:05.260- 23:10.140* :  that were able to actually improve the road safety conditions over the last couple of the
*23:10.420- 23:15.780* :  last 10 years. And how do they do that? Many of these countries have adopted what we have called
*23:15.780- 23:22.120* :  the safe systems approach. And that means focusing on the entire transport system, thinking about the
*23:22.120- 23:29.080* :  infrastructure, thinking about the safety of vehicles, as well as thinking about options for
*23:30.040- 23:35.500* :  mobility for pedestrians and cyclists, making sure that they have safe passage. As you well know,
*23:35.500- 23:42.320* :  in many of the cities, we see that there is only roads for cars. And as such, pedestrians and cyclists
*23:42.320- 23:48.060* :  have to share essentially that space with cars. And that's really why you see the high number
*23:48.060- 23:52.380* :  of deaths among pedestrians and cyclists that was just cited by the colleague in Uganda.
*23:52.900- 23:58.400* :  And picking up on that one, I wonder, then, what is the WHO doing to help those countries,
*23:59.300- 24:02.720* :  whether it's in Africa or around the globe, get to that safety?
*24:03.980- 24:09.080* :  Well, WHO is working with the governments very closely. And we're trying to do this with all
*24:09.080- 24:13.780* :  of the governments in the region as well. But we're really trying to raise awareness of the
*24:13.780- 24:18.680* :  magnitude of the problem. One of the biggest issues is that governments are not fully aware of
*24:18.680- 24:23.260* :  the magnitude and how much of an impact this has on public health, but also on the economy.
*24:23.940- 24:29.120* :  We're also working with other global partners, such as institutions that finance infrastructure
*24:29.120- 24:34.860* :  to ensure that there are safeguards for safety when roads are being built. And we're also trying
*24:34.860- 24:39.920* :  to work with other legislative bodies to ensure that vehicles that are entering into Africa
*24:39.920- 24:45.940* :  actually have the same level of safety that there are in vehicles in other parts of the world.
*24:46.480- 24:51.020* :  And currently, that's not the case. Many vehicles that are being sold in Africa don't have
*24:51.020- 24:56.400* :  the same level of safety that we find in Europe or North America or even in parts of Asia.
*24:56.400- 25:01.900* :  And that's a big problem. Dr. Nan Tran of the WHO's Safety and Mobility Unit,
*25:01.900- 25:07.500* :  speaking to Victoria Owen Kunder. Two men in the United States have been charged with
*25:07.500- 25:13.220* :  illegally poaching and selling parts of more than 3,000 birds. The killings include the
*25:13.220- 25:18.200* :  poaching of the National Bird, the Ball Legal. David Lewis has been following the story and
*25:18.200- 25:23.940* :  gave me the details. Simon Paul and Travis John Branson are a ledger to have shot the birds over
*25:23.940- 25:30.580* :  several years. And there were a lot of them, about 3,600 allegedly illegally killed by the men.
*25:30.860- 25:35.700* :  Species included smaller birds as well as larger bald and golden eagles. And indictment
*25:35.700- 25:41.040* :  released this week, so the animals were killed on the flathead Indian reservation in Western Montana
*25:41.040- 25:47.540* :  and elsewhere. Court records state the pair then sold the wings, tails and other body parts,
*25:47.540- 25:52.740* :  as well as whole dead eagles for what they described as significant sums of cash.
*25:53.040- 25:57.020* :  The bald eagle is a national birdie in the United States and a part of the National
*25:57.020- 26:01.780* :  psyche is depicted, of course, on the currency as well as the presidential seal that you'll
*26:01.780- 26:05.740* :  see on the lectern when Joe Biden is making a formal address at the White House.
*26:05.920- 26:07.700* :  And what more do we know about these two men?
*26:08.000- 26:13.240* :  Well, Mr Branson, who's 48 lives in Washington state and the 42 year old Mr Paul is from Montana
*26:13.240- 26:19.280* :  close to the flathead reservation. Federal prosecutors say Mr Branson would travel into state to
*26:19.280- 26:24.720* :  assist his co-defendant, according to the indictment, posted online by the Daily Montana newspaper.
*26:24.720- 26:32.380* :  It says from January 2019 until March 2021, Mr Paul was, quote, the shooter and shipper of the birds.
*26:32.380- 26:38.560* :  He would, quote, help kill transport and ship bald and golden eagles for future sales on the
*26:38.560- 26:43.560* :  black market. They say the pair killed deer and left them out to lure in eagles to feed.
*26:43.560- 26:48.980* :  Mr Branson, for his part, sent messages showing off about, quote, going on a killing spree.
*26:48.980- 26:54.440* :  The legal paper went on. On one date, Mr Branson is said to have texted a photo to a
*26:54.440- 27:00.980* :  purchaser showing a golden eagle tail set. The buyer replied, got that thang from Simon
*27:00.980- 27:06.200* :  and the mirror feathers, TNKS, meaning thanks. The men who've been unavailable comment
*27:06.200- 27:09.360* :  will appear in court in January. David Lewis.
*27:10.800- 27:15.640* :  Scientists say they have discovered why some women become extremely sick during pregnancy.
*27:15.640- 27:21.280* :  The condition known as hyperimus gravidorum can threaten the life of mothers and babies.
*27:21.860- 27:25.720* :  It affects hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of people every year.
*27:26.220- 27:30.300* :  The scientists say the next stage of their research is to look at possible treatments.
*27:30.300- 27:33.640* :  More details from our health reporter, Laura Foster.
*27:34.440- 27:37.920* :  This research by the Universities of Cambridge, Glasgow and Edinburgh,
*27:38.420- 27:42.860* :  as well as some from the USA and Sri Lanka, found out that the fetus produces a hormone
*27:42.860- 27:48.560* :  called GDF-15 as it grows. This goes into the mother's bloodstream and up to their brain,
*27:48.560- 27:53.680* :  causing them to feel nauseous and ill. How sick they feel depends on how much the hormone
*27:53.680- 27:59.080* :  is being produced by the baby to be, and how much GDF-15 was in the mother's bloodstream
*27:59.080- 28:04.720* :  before they became pregnant. The researchers say their next step is to start working on potential
*28:04.720- 28:11.000* :  cures and treatments. Laura Foster. And today, coming to a screen near you.
*28:11.480- 28:19.000* :  Don't start in and it's over, perhaps. Now is the time.
*28:21.600- 28:24.480* :  This is what we expect with the longest serving monarch in history.
*28:26.360- 28:29.500* :  People will want to celebrate your reign and mark the end of an era.
*28:31.220- 28:36.660* :  But what about the life I put aside? The woman I put aside
*28:38.420- 28:39.320* :  when I became queen.
*28:42.080- 28:47.540* :  The final episodes of the Netflix series, The Crown, a television drama loosely based on the
*28:47.540- 28:52.520* :  lives of the British royal families released today. The final instruments feature the years
*28:52.520- 28:58.180* :  following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. There have been mixed reviews by the critics who've
*28:58.180- 29:03.700* :  seen it. Our arts correspondent Vincent Dowd has spent the morning watching the new episodes.
*29:04.580- 29:09.480* :  The Crown has had 60 episodes in six years. The creation, of course, of the writer Peter Morgan,
*29:09.480- 29:14.600* :  who'd already written the film A Big Hit, The Queen, in 2006. So he's spent a long time writing
*29:14.600- 29:19.180* :  about royals. When it started, some people disliked his idea of putting the life of the queen,
*29:19.180- 29:24.160* :  then of course still alive into what was called by them and upmarket soap opera. But audiences
*29:24.160- 29:29.200* :  around the world took to the Crown quickly and the amount of press coverage and social media
*29:29.200- 29:35.640* :  comment over the years has been beyond calculation, released today of the six concluding episodes
*29:35.640- 29:40.620* :  of the sixth and final season. The first four, as we've said, came out in November.
*29:41.400- 29:45.900* :  And these final episodes, I think, tell the story of the after the death of Princess Diana.
*29:46.400- 29:51.400* :  Where does the series actually end? Yes, I think Netflix were very keen to separate the main
*29:51.400- 29:56.020* :  let's call them Princess Diana elements from the rest of the story. Inevitably, that was at times
*29:56.020- 30:00.360* :  a grim watch. It couldn't have been anything else. In this final run, we pick up the story well
*30:00.360- 30:04.660* :  after that point to remind people the queen is still played by Emelda Staunton. Prince Philip
*30:04.660- 30:09.200* :  is played by Jonathan Price. The critical consensus, I think it's fair to say, was often that
*30:09.200- 30:14.600* :  in the middle stretch, the Crown did flag a bit. What we have in these final stories is the arrival
*30:14.600- 30:19.460* :  of Tony Blair in Downing Street, the queen called in President Blair, the death of Princess Margaret
*30:19.460- 30:25.020* :  in 2002. The romance between William and Kate and obvious and building tensions between William
*30:25.020- 30:30.720* :  and his brother Harry. The story ends before Meghan Markle appears basically with the queen's
*30:30.720- 30:36.400* :  golden Jubilee in 2002. But in this final episode, which I and lots of other people have been
*30:36.400- 30:41.480* :  watching today, Peter Morgan does allow himself a certain amount of fantasy. There's a very powerful
*30:41.480- 30:46.620* :  scene, I thought, involving a bagpipe lament. I won't explain any more than that. And it turns out
*30:46.620- 30:51.160* :  we hadn't quite seen the end of Claire Foye and Olivia Coleman, who of course played the queen
*30:51.160- 30:57.120* :  in younger life. I think it's a very strong ending. And briefly, has the Crown shaped the way
*30:57.120- 31:01.940* :  people around the world see the raw family? Well, I think the positive is that it's shown the queen
*31:01.940- 31:06.720* :  who of course came to the throne aged 25 only to have been for decades a figure of great strength
*31:06.720- 31:10.400* :  and dedication. But there are lots of people who weren't around when Diana died and they
*31:10.400- 31:15.740* :  may see events dramatized here as showing a monarch who was at times old-fashioned and unsympathetic.
*31:16.120- 31:19.580* :  But it's complex. There were viewers who watched the middle episodes with their clear suggestion
*31:19.660- 31:24.960* :  that Queen couldn't stand Margaret Fatcher as an argument for monarchy. So people will be discussing
*31:24.960- 31:31.400* :  the Crown for a long time to come, I'm sure. Vincent Dowd, an eye for one, will be glued to my TV
*31:31.400- 31:38.100* :  tonight. Well, that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
