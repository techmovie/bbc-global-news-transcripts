*01:45.920- 01:50.000* :  I'm Nick Miles and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 15th of December.
*01:50.180- 01:51.160* :  These are our main stories.
*01:51.800- 01:56.460* :  Hungary blocks a $55 billion EU aid package to Ukraine.
*01:56.960- 01:59.160* :  And now says it may continue to do so.
*01:59.840- 02:02.360* :  The US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan
*02:02.360- 02:06.160* :  urges Israel to do more to limit civilian casualties in Gaza.
*02:06.920- 02:09.440* :  In a case brought by Prince Harry, a judge in London,
*02:09.480- 02:12.460* :  has ruled there was extensive phone hacking
*02:12.580- 02:14.600* :  by a newspaper group over a number of years.
*02:17.260- 02:20.820* :  Also in this podcast it's 40 below zero in parts of China.
*02:21.180- 02:21.960* :  How are people coping?
*02:22.420- 02:26.660* :  And we preview Serbia's local and general elections this weekend.
*02:27.000- 02:30.840* :  In media, especially those mainstream most influential
*02:30.880- 02:36.100* :  for Serbian citizens media, there is a chronicle lack of pluralism.
*02:40.000- 02:44.100* :  The Hungarian Prime Minister has warned he's prepared to stop any further attempts
*02:44.100- 02:46.480* :  to send European Union money to Ukraine.
*02:47.140- 02:51.940* :  Viktor Orban was speaking after he vetoed a package of aid worth $55 billion
*02:51.940- 02:54.140* :  at the EU summit in Brussels.
*02:54.760- 02:58.820* :  But he also suggested he could lift his veto on money for Kiev
*02:58.820- 03:02.420* :  if the EU released more funds destined for Hungary.
*03:03.040- 03:06.600* :  On Thursday, Mr. Orban absented himself from a vote which granted Ukraine
*03:06.600- 03:09.760* :  the right to begin formal EU membership talks,
*03:10.380- 03:12.700* :  but didn't rule out ending the talks later.
*03:15.520- 03:18.820* :  Let's be clear, Ukraine is not ready to be part of the EU.
*03:19.500- 03:20.680* :  This decision is premature.
*03:20.940- 03:23.360* :  The situation is not ripe for it.
*03:23.920- 03:27.000* :  I've said let's come back to this issue when Ukraine is ready,
*03:27.100- 03:28.640* :  but they couldn't be convinced.
*03:29.500- 03:32.580* :  Once again, I struggled for eight hours to explain to them
*03:32.580- 03:36.080* :  that helping the wrong way is worse than not helping at all.
*03:36.880- 03:39.520* :  And what they want is to give Ukraine through this decision,
*03:39.520- 03:42.280* :  the encouragement it needs to continue the war.
*03:43.020- 03:46.460* :  I got more from our regional editor, Danny Aberhard, in Brussels.
*03:46.980- 03:51.860* :  Hungary's position broadly, Nick, is that it doesn't want these funds to come out of the EU budget.
*03:52.540- 03:56.740* :  It says that basically there needs to be a strategic debate about Ukraine.
*03:56.780- 04:01.980* :  It thinks that the war is going nowhere and there needs to be some sort of move towards peace
*04:01.980- 04:06.280* :  negotiations. Kiev obviously would reject that out of hands.
*04:06.780- 04:09.960* :  And other EU nations back here in that position.
*04:10.480- 04:14.760* :  It's often characterized as being Victor Orban being a friend of Vladimir Putin,
*04:14.800- 04:18.340* :  which is true. He's the closest leader within the EU to Vladimir Putin
*04:18.360- 04:21.500* :  and has maintained relations with him throughout the war.
*04:22.040- 04:25.480* :  He even met him in October and recently in Beijing.
*04:26.900- 04:31.540* :  But it's more complicated than that because Hungary also has this long-running dispute
*04:31.660- 04:34.580* :  with the European Commission, whereby the European Commission
*04:34.580- 04:41.120* :  froze about 30 billion euros worth of funds and disputes with democratic issues,
*04:41.120- 04:45.200* :  such as the rule of law in Hungary, academic freedoms,
*04:45.200- 04:47.760* :  the treatment of asylum seekers, these sort of things.
*04:48.280- 04:53.460* :  And it's only on the eve of the summit released about a third of that,
*04:53.460- 04:55.900* :  10 billion euros of those frozen funds.
*04:55.960- 05:00.220* :  And it's clear from both what Victor Orban says and also what his advisors say,
*05:00.520- 05:04.020* :  that actually Hungary believes it should be getting 100% of those funds.
*05:04.440- 05:07.140* :  And that clearly is a condition it seems before.
*05:07.140- 05:10.240* :  It moves on why do you crane funding?
*05:10.640- 05:13.180* :  It's not against funding you crane in general.
*05:14.500- 05:18.840* :  And it also points out that EU nations can all individually fund
*05:18.840- 05:20.140* :  Ukraine as much as they want.
*05:20.620- 05:24.760* :  And that may be the way that the EU takes if it can't get Hungary
*05:25.160- 05:28.240* :  to agree to release European budget funds,
*05:28.520- 05:31.320* :  form a different mechanism that works outside of the budget.
*05:31.560- 05:36.280* :  Danny, it sounds from the outside, as Hungary is effectively trying to blackmail the EU.
*05:36.700- 05:37.560* :  How has it viewed there?
*05:38.500- 05:44.440* :  Well, a journalist put that precise question to Victor Orban's political advisor here in the
*05:44.440- 05:47.080* :  summit who came out of discussions to brief journalists.
*05:47.080- 05:53.040* :  And he rejected that out of hand, he said, that actually it's other countries within the EU
*05:53.040- 05:57.020* :  that have been blackmailing Hungary over these frozen funds.
*05:57.020- 06:00.960* :  For example, the COVID recovery funds and the cohesion funds that the European
*06:00.960- 06:02.020* :  Commission has got.
*06:03.360- 06:07.780* :  Now, lots of people again reject that position from Hungary, but it's something they maintain.
*06:08.200- 06:12.820* :  And it seems as though their lever over the months ahead will be as much to do with
*06:12.820- 06:14.740* :  the release of those funds as anything else.
*06:15.100- 06:19.280* :  But obviously the EU, as I said, have other ways and they may decide that
*06:19.840- 06:23.480* :  rather than trying to persuade Hungary, if Hungary is not moving,
*06:23.480- 06:26.920* :  that they will set up something else, a separate structure.
*06:27.280- 06:30.340* :  So I don't think the matter's dead and Kiev can, I would have thought,
*06:30.340- 06:33.480* :  expect funds of some description in the months ahead.
*06:33.940- 06:35.020* :  Danny Aberhardt.
*06:35.520- 06:40.300* :  Well, as it stands, more than a hundred billion dollars worth of aid to Ukraine is blocked,
*06:40.300- 06:45.540* :  50 or so in the EU, and more than 60 is sold in the U.S. Congress.
*06:45.940- 06:52.320* :  The BBC's Abdul Jalil Abdul Rasulov has visited the front lines in eastern Ukraine to hear
*06:52.320- 06:55.820* :  how concern over ally support is affecting troops.
*07:01.180- 07:07.060* :  And the artillery unit of Ukraine's 93rd brigade receives intel on a new target to destroy.
*07:12.100- 07:17.020* :  The entire crew of the U.S. made M109 Hounzer springs into action.
*07:18.060- 07:21.540* :  The engine roars. One of the soldiers loads the gun.
*07:22.300- 07:24.280* :  Another one pulls the cord.
*07:28.880- 07:31.280* :  The evening explosion shakes the armored machine.
*07:32.720- 07:37.840* :  We are near the town of Bachmuth, which Russians took last May, but has failed to advance
*07:38.160- 07:39.560* :  any further since then.
*07:41.580- 07:46.300* :  I'm looking at the M109 Paladin self-propelled house.
*07:47.680- 07:51.360* :  It's a huge gun. Basically, it looks like a tank with a big barrel.
*07:53.300- 07:59.600* :  It's hidden under a tent, so that Russian drones will not be able to spot it.
*08:00.680- 08:06.100* :  And weapons like this, provided by Western countries, make a huge difference on the front line.
*08:06.440- 08:11.560* :  As the conflict increasingly turns to stalemate, it's demoralizing for Ukrainian soldiers
*08:12.080- 08:16.300* :  to hear that America's funding for Ukraine has ground to a halt.
*08:21.780- 08:25.420* :  If there is no military support from the West, then things will be really bad.
*08:26.580- 08:30.880* :  First, Russia will seize Ukraine, then it will be the turn of the Baltic states, Poland.
*08:31.700- 08:33.060* :  I think Russia will not stop here.
*08:39.900- 08:44.580* :  After one round of fire, Sasha and the rest of the crew are told to hide the gun.
*08:45.740- 08:49.240* :  They throw branches of trees in the cover of the machine with camouflaged nets.
*08:50.180- 08:54.600* :  But soldiers worry that their guns will remain silent for much longer,
*08:54.960- 08:57.600* :  without continued Western funding and supplies.
*08:58.700- 09:05.000* :  Sasha, again, without ammunition, this American howitzer will just be scrap metal.
*09:05.780- 09:09.540* :  It will be a nice machine, we can drive it, but we won't be able to fight with it.
*09:15.700- 09:18.960* :  We visit a different artillery unit fighting nearby.
*09:22.480- 09:27.280* :  They use 2S-1 Grasdika system, a Soviet artillery relic.
*09:31.060- 09:34.360* :  It's command that means that they face a shortage of ammunition.
*09:38.580- 09:45.440* :  After loading the gun, the crew has to wait for hours to command to open fire on a high-value target.
*09:46.300- 09:50.540* :  They simply cannot afford to waste ammunition on anything else.
*09:50.980- 09:55.620* :  The latest developments in the U.S. Congress creates a sense of disillusionment here.
*09:56.460- 09:59.900* :  Kant, one of the gunners, expresses his frustration.
*10:04.780- 10:08.820* :  Our Western partners must understand that if we fail to stop Russians,
*10:08.820- 10:12.120* :  then they will go further, and then instead of helping us,
*10:12.280- 10:16.240* :  we'll be defending their own lands, and their own people will be dying.
*10:18.240- 10:23.920* :  Though the future is uncertain, Ukrainians say they will continue to defend their land
*10:23.960- 10:29.580* :  with or without external aid. That was Abdul Jalil, Abdul Rasulov.
*10:30.880- 10:35.440* :  Russia is fighting Ukraine on many fronts, and not all of them are military.
*10:36.120- 10:40.760* :  The BBC has discovered evidence of a large-scale Russian disinformation campaign involving
*10:40.760- 10:45.700* :  thousands of fake accounts that spread false details about Ukraine on TikTok.
*10:45.700- 10:51.500* :  Its videos routinely attract millions of views and appear to have the aim of undermining
*10:51.500- 10:56.780* :  Western support for Ukraine in the war. Olga Robinson is from BBC Verify.
*10:57.540- 11:03.100* :  TikTok told the BBC that it's taken down more than 12,000 fake accounts belonging to what it
*11:03.100- 11:08.920* :  described as a sophisticated influence operation originating in Russia, after the BBC flagged
*11:08.920- 11:13.860* :  the activity of the network to them. Posting his ordinary users, the fake accounts portray
*11:13.860- 11:18.480* :  Ukraine's leaders as corrupt, and sanctions on Russia's harmful to Europeans.
*11:19.320- 11:24.180* :  One of those targeted was the former Ukrainian Defence Minister Alexei Reznikov,
*11:24.320- 11:27.860* :  who was accused of buying luxury villas in France and Spain.
*11:27.860- 11:34.480* :  BBC Verify found these claims to be false. Mr Reznikov's daughter Anastasia Steinhaus
*11:34.840- 11:39.620* :  told the BBC she thinks this is Russia trying to undermine Western aid for Ukraine.
*11:39.620- 11:45.500* :  When the government of your country says let's help Ukraine, let's stand with Ukraine.
*11:45.500- 11:51.120* :  On the one hand you see this, on the other hand you receive a video where you see that money
*11:51.120- 11:58.920* :  that you gave to this Ukraine is going not to win the war, but to buy villa or to buy
*11:58.920- 12:02.860* :  car. Of course you don't want to stand with Ukraine at this moment.
*12:03.220- 12:08.280* :  The BBC is still finding new accounts in the network, and TikTok says it's continued to monitor
*12:08.280- 12:14.720* :  the situation. Olga Robinson. As we record this podcast, the US National Security Advisor,
*12:14.720- 12:19.620* :  Jake Sullivan, is due to meet Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.
*12:20.120- 12:25.020* :  Mr Sullivan was in Jerusalem on Thursday with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*12:25.560- 12:30.820* :  The US has firmly backed Israel's war on Hamas since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October
*12:30.820- 12:37.540* :  7. Mr Sullivan spoke ahead of the meeting. The control of Gaza, the administration of Gaza and
*12:37.540- 12:43.300* :  the security of Gaza has to transition to the Palestinians. Now the question of how that transition
*12:43.300- 12:48.200* :  occurs over what timetable that is also something that we are having intensive discussions about,
*12:48.200- 12:54.520* :  but the US position on this is clear. We do not believe that it makes sense or is right for Israel
*12:54.520- 13:00.960* :  to occupy Gaza, re-occupy Gaza over the long term. Our correspondent Yolanda Nell has this update from
*13:00.960- 13:06.040* :  Jerusalem. There have been fierce battles between Israeli forces and Hamas fighters in pockets
*13:06.040- 13:11.360* :  across Gaza, as well as Israeli airstrikes in the center and south of the territory with children
*13:11.360- 13:16.800* :  reportedly among the dead. Speaking after what he described as very constructive talks with Israeli
*13:16.800- 13:21.800* :  leaders, the US national security adviser Mr Sullivan said it would take months to achieve
*13:21.800- 13:27.220* :  Israel's objectives in the war, but that fighting would proceed in phases with a shift away from
*13:27.220- 13:32.800* :  the intensity of the current campaign. He added that giving a time frame for this would be irresponsible.
*13:32.800- 13:38.280* :  The US official then travelled to Ramallah, having said there's a need to revamp and revitalize
*13:38.280- 13:43.520* :  the Palestinian authority. Washington is pressing for the authority to have a role in Gaza's future
*13:43.520- 13:48.940* :  governance, despite its low popularity with the Palestinian public and opposition from Israel.
*13:49.520- 13:54.760* :  Yolanda Nell. With the conflict in Gaza, which has seen nearly two million people displaced,
*13:54.760- 14:00.500* :  has been dominating a UN forum on refugees in Geneva. This year, even before the war in Gaza,
*14:00.500- 14:07.000* :  countries across the world were trying to deal with a record of 114 million refugees or internally
*14:07.000- 14:11.600* :  displaced people. The newsrooms Jeanette Jalil is at the refugee forum.
*14:12.400- 14:16.740* :  For the past couple of days, this forum has seen pledges of millions of dollars of aid from
*14:16.740- 14:21.900* :  countries, sports authorities and businesses to help the unprecedented number of people who've
*14:21.900- 14:25.860* :  been forcefully displaced because of war, persecution or other human rights violations.
*14:25.980- 14:30.680* :  But the UN Refugee Agency, which has organised this forum, says this still isn't enough.
*14:30.680- 14:36.280* :  Despite the scale of the problem, humanitarian agencies like the UNHCR say they've seen their
*14:36.280- 14:41.960* :  funding fall to the lowest level for years. And that was before the crisis in Gaza.
*14:42.520- 14:47.200* :  I spoke to the head of the UN Palestinian Refugee Agency for the Pulasarini who's been in
*14:47.200- 14:53.320* :  Gaza this week and has described it as hell on earth. He said huge numbers of people
*14:53.320- 14:59.700* :  forced to camp outside. They're going hungry in a way he's never seen before begging for a scrap
*14:59.700- 15:05.540* :  of bread or gobbling food aid as soon as they get it on the spot. I just come back from Gaza.
*15:06.060- 15:14.360* :  I have seen the huge discrepancy between the immensity of the needs of the people and the
*15:14.360- 15:20.400* :  crippling of the humanitarian assistance entering into the Gaza Strip.
*15:20.700- 15:24.820* :  Do you think the lack of food, the lack of aid, the lack of shelter, basic things? Do you think
*15:24.960- 15:27.740* :  Israel is using those as a weapon of war against Palestinians?
*15:28.860- 15:35.100* :  I believe and I have warned more than once that very soon people in the Gaza Strip
*15:35.560- 15:42.480* :  might not die because of the bombardment only, but they might also start to die because of the
*15:42.480- 15:49.620* :  impact of the siege. And what I have seen being now in winter, 70 days into the war,
*15:50.040- 16:01.360* :  with weakened immunity of the people, with outbreak of disease that we might be on the eve of a
*16:01.360- 16:08.600* :  massive deaths in the Gaza Strip. Now Israel has rejected allegations that it's collectively
*16:08.600- 16:15.920* :  punishing Palestinians. Away from Gaza, conflicts in Ukraine, Colombia, Afghanistan and Sudan,
*16:15.920- 16:21.300* :  among other places, have caused a record surge in the number of refugees, more than 35 million
*16:21.300- 16:26.880* :  people. But contrary to perceptions in the West where anti-immigrant politicians are reaping the
*16:26.880- 16:32.200* :  benefits of growing hostility to asylum seekers, three quarters of the world's refugees are actually
*16:32.200- 16:37.060* :  hosted by low and middle income countries, which are already struggling to provide for their
*16:37.060- 16:41.960* :  own citizens. So this forum is looking at what more can be done to help create education and
*16:41.960- 16:47.200* :  employment opportunities for displaced people and to change perceptions by, for instance, hearing
*16:47.200- 16:52.600* :  from refugees themselves, some of whom have gone on to achieve great things, such as being chosen,
*16:52.600- 17:01.720* :  to participate in next year's Paris Olympics. Still to come in this podcast, Australians pay a
*17:01.720- 17:06.700* :  final farewell to a national treasure. It's in honour of the extraordinary talent of the area
*17:06.700- 17:12.280* :  since, yeah, we idolized it. It's a bit like the Queen. He should not have died.
*17:18.560- 17:23.400* :  Hello, I'm Katya Adler and this is the Global Story from the BBC World Service.
*17:23.640- 17:29.120* :  China and America came together at a greed on this climate issue. We're here to look beyond the
*17:29.120- 17:34.640* :  headlines, peel back lazy assumptions and give you a fresh global perspective on the stories that
*17:34.640- 17:41.000* :  matter is Europe tiring in terms of its support for Ukraine. They will have to be some kind of
*17:41.000- 17:46.760* :  negotiation to end this war. Search for the global story wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*17:48.820- 17:54.920* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Voters in Serbia get to elect a new parliament this weekend
*17:54.920- 18:00.520* :  and as our Balkan's Gorosvonant Guide to Lorne reports, this is a significant test for President
*18:00.520- 18:06.180* :  Alexander Vocic. Serbia's parliamentary elections are just a matter of days away.
*18:06.180- 18:11.560* :  The same goes for municipal elections in the capital Belgrade and many other places around the
*18:11.560- 18:17.000* :  country. Here outside the national assembly, the rabbanas and billboards are plenty for most
*18:17.000- 18:21.560* :  of the different party lists. For the most recent polls, we're only held last April,
*18:21.560- 18:28.700* :  so the mood isn't so much. Here we go. Here we go again. The opposition claimed that we have lost
*18:28.700- 18:36.960* :  the credibility, the legitimacy and that elections need to be held. Anna Barnavic has been
*18:36.960- 18:42.420* :  Serbia's prime minister since 2017. She's a member of the governing progressive party.
*18:42.420- 18:47.660* :  In the spirit of democracy, we wanted to say yes. We never run away from elections.
*18:47.660- 18:53.520* :  So, you know, if someone thinks that we have lost legitimacy and wants to double track it,
*18:54.220- 18:59.460* :  we can always do that and see, however, people vote, we will respect that.
*19:03.200- 19:08.560* :  The call for elections followed months of weekly protests in Belgrade and other big cities.
*19:11.880- 19:17.220* :  People marched under the banner Serbia against violence. The demonstrations started after two
*19:17.220- 19:22.260* :  mass shootings on consecutive days in May horrified the country, but quickly,
*19:22.260- 19:27.500* :  opposition parties got involved. They claimed the shootings reflected the culture of rhetorical
*19:27.500- 19:32.440* :  and physical violence promoted by President Alexander Vucic, the progressive party,
*19:32.440- 19:38.380* :  and their allies in the media. Now, 15 parties have set aside their differences to fight the
*19:38.380- 19:44.320* :  elections as the Serbia against violence coalition. Borkos Stefanovic is the deputy leader of the
*19:44.320- 19:48.460* :  centre-left party of freedom and justice. When it was obvious that the government will not
*19:48.460- 19:55.440* :  fulfill any of the requests of the people in the streets, that's why we all, as we are all
*19:55.440- 20:03.540* :  European parties, we decided to come together and to do what people have been demanding from us
*20:10.080- 20:14.080* :  for years. The Serbia against violence coalition is the first credible opposition proposition
*20:14.080- 20:19.860* :  in a decade, but they still face an uphill struggle. The governing party enjoys friendly coverage
*20:19.860- 20:25.800* :  from much of the media, and their trump card is Serbia's president. Alexander Vucic isn't up for
*20:25.800- 20:30.540* :  election, but he's given his name to the progressive's electoral list and he's all over the
*20:30.540- 20:37.500* :  airwaves. In 2023, President Vucic addressed the nation, live, more than 260 times.
*20:37.800- 20:42.240* :  Russian Adelkov is the programme director of the election monitor, the centre for research,
*20:42.240- 20:50.180* :  transparency and accountability. In the past year, 95% of all interlocutors in central
*20:50.180- 20:55.860* :  news, in five national TV stations, were reserved for one group, group that is in the government.
*20:56.960- 21:04.580* :  In a neutral and in a positive tone. Nonetheless, green left front members
*21:04.700- 21:08.220* :  are in a jovial mood at a campaign event with European greens.
*21:14.760- 21:18.960* :  They're also part of the Serbia against violence coalition, but they're not promising their
*21:18.960- 21:24.560* :  supporters overall victory. Billiana Georgiwicz is their co-leader. I don't think that changes can
*21:24.560- 21:32.740* :  happen overnight. We in green left front believe in changes bottom up from cities, from municipalities,
*21:32.740- 21:37.880* :  that's why winning the Belgrade elections is so important. And then, in six months, you win,
*21:38.200- 21:43.480* :  you know, a sad, that's the second biggest city, a niche, the third biggest city, and then things change.
*21:48.860- 21:54.400* :  The progressive party is also portraying a confident front. They're sticking to their lines about
*21:54.400- 21:58.900* :  promoting Serbia's European Union membership while maintaining friendship with Russia,
*21:59.360- 22:04.880* :  and above all, being a reliable party of government, will soon know whether the electorate agrees.
*22:07.500- 22:12.920* :  A wave of extreme cold weather is extending its grip across China with temperatures expected
*22:12.920- 22:18.860* :  to fall as low as a minus 40 degrees Celsius in some northern areas. The authorities are trying
*22:18.860- 22:24.580* :  to ensure unbroken supplies of electricity during the cold snap and protect crops at risk of
*22:24.580- 22:28.340* :  damage. Or Asia Pacific editor Michael Bristow is following developments.
*22:28.920- 22:33.860* :  I think it's pretty extreme because of its how widespread it is. As you say, China is a vast
*22:33.860- 22:38.860* :  country in the far north east. In winter it gets very, very cold. I've been up there myself and
*22:38.860- 22:44.540* :  I can attest to that how cold it does get, but it's particularly cold across the whole of country
*22:45.080- 22:52.440* :  from the north east right down to the southwest in Tibet, where you have massive snowstorms,
*22:52.440- 22:58.620* :  blocking roads, right across the country to the east in Shanghai, where you have trains cancelled,
*22:58.620- 23:04.400* :  buses cancelled, and across a massive swath of central and southern areas, where there's fear
*23:04.400- 23:09.880* :  for winter crops are there being protected. So I think what's unusual about this particular
*23:10.720- 23:16.340* :  cold snap, which is going to extend for the next week or 10 days or so, is that it's more widespread.
*23:17.080- 23:21.600* :  It's extended beyond areas which traditionally you expect cold weather in China.
*23:22.420- 23:27.380* :  And Mickey, China has been grappling with weather extremes throughout this year, hasn't it?
*23:28.340- 23:32.680* :  It has. You've got to remember China is such a vast country just before I came on area. I had a
*23:33.000- 23:37.600* :  quick look at the temperature in the far south, high in an island where people often go to
*23:38.700- 23:43.100* :  winter because it's so hot, it's over 30 degrees yes, so people are going to be on the beach,
*23:43.100- 23:49.420* :  but yes, China is a country where there's vast differences in temperatures, but over recent
*23:50.580- 23:56.620* :  years, it has been a tendency to have more extreme cases. So over the last few years, we've had a
*23:56.620- 24:03.400* :  lot of drought in the south and the southwest. That's led to problems with hydroelectric power stations,
*24:03.400- 24:09.520* :  not functioning properly, crops failing, and already now you've had to really, really
*24:09.520- 24:15.400* :  service cold snaps already. This winter just in November in the northeast was extremely
*24:16.060- 24:21.380* :  high levels of snow there, so what you are seeing are trend as you see in across the rest of the
*24:21.380- 24:26.640* :  world is more extreme weather in a place which already has extreme weather. And when you have
*24:26.640- 24:31.460* :  extreme weather events in many parts of the world, the media pick up on this and sort of say,
*24:31.460- 24:37.400* :  oh, is it climate change? Does similar kind of things happen in the press in China and the
*24:37.400- 24:43.920* :  media in general? Yes, a good question. And sometimes yes, and that is obviously something which
*24:43.920- 24:48.080* :  is discussed, but in the official media, I've just been having a look, for example, at the official
*24:48.080- 24:54.120* :  media, social media offerings and what they've been doing about the weather. Mostly they haven't
*24:54.120- 24:58.460* :  been talking about the accident which you mentioned there in Beijing at which a hundred people have
*24:58.460- 25:05.080* :  broken bones or fractured bones, 500 people had to go to hospital when these two trains collided.
*25:05.400- 25:09.540* :  There isn't a lot of mention of that or the negative effects of it, but there is a lot of
*25:09.540- 25:17.820* :  pictures of people enjoying themselves in the snow. Ice being cut out of rivers to form ice
*25:17.820- 25:22.380* :  festivals, which is an ice festival in Harbin, so they prepare the ice there or people enjoying
*25:22.380- 25:29.260* :  themselves in temples or mountain tops. Not a lot of emphasis really on the cold weather and
*25:29.260- 25:34.860* :  the disruption and the climate change because the government likes to present a happy picture
*25:34.860- 25:38.020* :  of life in China, not the negative side. Mickey Bristol.
*25:39.540- 25:45.160* :  Prince Harry has won a phone hacking case against a big newspaper group. It brought the case against
*25:45.400- 25:50.560* :  Mirror Group newspapers saying that they'd used unlawful means like phone hacking to get stories
*25:50.560- 25:56.740* :  about him. The UK's high court said it found widespread and habitual use of dishonest practices.
*25:57.440- 26:01.040* :  Prince Harry's lawyer read a statement from him to reporters outside the court.
*26:01.800- 26:07.680* :  I've been told that slaying dragons will get you burned, but in light of today's victory and
*26:07.680- 26:14.560* :  the importance of doing what is needed for a free and honest press, it is a worthwhile price to pay.
*26:15.260- 26:20.060* :  The mission continues. Our correspondent Sean Cochlan told me more about Harry's journey in the
*26:20.060- 26:25.700* :  courts. In some ways it's a big day for him. He's had lots and lots of law cases against numerous
*26:25.700- 26:32.500* :  newspaper groups and here today we had the biggest fighting so far, an actual legal ruling on
*26:32.580- 26:38.080* :  an evidence given in a massive case that was held in June in London and it's found in Harry's
*26:38.080- 26:43.460* :  favour, 15 out of 33 cases he's been proven to have been hacked. I think he'll be very pleased
*26:43.460- 26:47.400* :  with that. It's a difficult decision for the Mirror. They seem to have accepted it and said this
*26:47.400- 26:52.840* :  was a long time ago. There are different companies now and they want to move on. There has been
*26:52.840- 26:59.100* :  a question of damages. We know that there's 140,000 and 600 pounds damages awarded to Prince Harry,
*26:59.480- 27:03.480* :  but this has never been about the money. This has been about the principle and I think he was
*27:03.800- 27:10.040* :  willing not to settle out of court, willing to pursue his claim, willing to go to have his day in court
*27:10.040- 27:15.560* :  and to risk cross-examination over two days in the summer so that he could eventually say,
*27:15.560- 27:22.380* :  a court has said, I have been hacked. I think it is the biggest day what's been a campaign of
*27:22.380- 27:27.620* :  many years of his and his protest about how he's been treated by the press. So to what extent
*27:27.620- 27:35.440* :  Sean could this lead to a whole slew of other cases like this? Well, it opens the door to other people
*27:35.440- 27:40.720* :  coming to Mirror Group and saying they've also been victims. We know they've already paid out
*27:40.720- 27:46.820* :  over 100 million pounds in damages and legal costs over previous hacking claims. So this again
*27:46.820- 27:51.040* :  could be a very high stakes for them. They have to have to pay out even more and they might
*27:51.040- 27:55.020* :  embolden other people to come forward and say that they also were victims. We don't know that
*27:55.020- 28:00.280* :  yet, but certainly has been talked about dozens of people who might follow in Prince Harry's wake.
*28:00.620- 28:06.260* :  Now this does seem to have been a very common way in which newspaper groups got information about
*28:06.260- 28:13.760* :  prominent people. To what extent is that still likely to be going on or as technology superseded
*28:13.760- 28:18.300* :  you think? Well, you'd like to think it was very, very much stopped once awareness was raised
*28:18.300- 28:22.980* :  about it. It was seen to be illegal and with imagined newspaper groups stopped doing it.
*28:23.360- 28:29.420* :  In this case, the judge has been very clear that this was widespread and habitual within this
*28:29.420- 28:34.740* :  particular news group at that time. As we know, Prince Harry is also conducting other lawsuits
*28:34.740- 28:40.420* :  against other newspaper groups and they will strongly argue that they haven't been involved in
*28:40.420- 28:45.060* :  this sort of practice and that their news always be gathered by entirely legitimate means.
*28:45.460- 28:49.380* :  But it does open that question again, which perhaps some of us might have thought to be
*28:49.380- 28:53.480* :  input in the past. There's debates about phone hacking and stories which are from
*28:54.460- 29:01.000* :  sometimes to 20 years ago. Sean Cochlan. A state memorial service has taken place at the Sydney
*29:01.000- 29:07.180* :  Opera House for the entertainer Barry Humpfries who died in April, aged 89. Hundreds of people gathered
*29:07.180- 29:12.120* :  to celebrate the life of the man behind the larger than life character Dame Edner Everidge
*29:12.480- 29:19.800* :  with tributes from King Charles and Sir Elton John. Barry Humpfries was one of the funniest
*29:19.800- 29:26.160* :  people in the world, but you all know that. He's also one of the kindest and most generous person to
*29:26.200- 29:31.620* :  me. It's sad that we won't be seeing him again, but we have so many members of him, his books,
*29:32.320- 29:38.440* :  his TV appearances and the wonderful jokes and the wonderful kindness that he showed to me and
*29:39.400- 29:42.840* :  our correspondent Phil Mercer was at the service at the Sydney Opera House.
*29:48.580- 29:52.820* :  One of Australia's brightest stars has been remembered as a comic genius.
*29:53.540- 29:59.000* :  The state memorial for Barry Humpfries at the Sydney Opera House brought together family
*29:59.000- 30:05.700* :  friends and hundreds of fans. Well, it's in honour of Edner of course and the extraordinary talent
*30:05.800- 30:14.800* :  of Barry Humpfries. It's a bit like the Queen. He should not have died. I came up last night,
*30:14.800- 30:22.260* :  especially to come to this memorial service. King Charles said in a message that the entertainer was
*30:22.260- 30:29.540* :  a cultured and erudite man who through his creations punctured pomposity. The actor Rob
*30:29.540- 30:34.760* :  Brydon said he was the master and that there was nobody better than Barry Humpfries.
*30:35.720- 30:41.720* :  His most irrepressible creation was Dame Edner, an outrageous suburban housewife who would
*30:41.720- 30:49.040* :  define his career. The actor Son Oscar said his father's work will always connect people to a
*30:49.060- 30:56.260* :  different time. He documents a sort of changing Australia and an Australia that doesn't exist anymore.
*30:56.300- 31:03.480* :  We saw the ice cream truck on Bondi is now an ass-eye bowl truck and Dad would have put that
*31:03.480- 31:09.740* :  in a show and he connects us to a very different Australia. He grew up in the 1940s and 50s,
*31:09.740- 31:15.000* :  but in the end he just made us laugh, didn't he? The Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this
*31:15.000- 31:21.840* :  comedic giant brought such joy to every part of Australia and showered it upon the world.
*31:22.700- 31:29.340* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
