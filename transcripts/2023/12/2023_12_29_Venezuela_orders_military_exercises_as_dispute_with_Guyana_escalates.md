*00:49.880- 00:53.860* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:56.120- 01:02.480* :  I'm Nigel Adely and in the early hours of Friday the 29th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:03.260- 01:09.340* :  Venezuela's President Nicolas Madordo ups the ante by ordering military exercises on the country's
*01:09.340- 01:15.660* :  eastern Caribbean and Atlantic coasts in an escalation of a territorial dispute with Guyana.
*01:17.760- 01:24.520* :  I have ordered the activation of a joint action of the entire Bolivarian national military force
*01:24.520- 01:30.800* :  of a defensive nature. Also, why the Mexican authorities won't be punishing residents of a town
*01:30.800- 01:36.920* :  who killed 10 members of a drug's cartel and a court in Qatar commute the death sentences
*01:37.480- 01:40.800* :  of eight Indians reportedly accused of espionage.
*01:43.740- 01:49.560* :  Also in this podcast, a special report on whether the change of government in Brazil has helped
*01:49.560- 01:55.980* :  the Amazon rainforest and its people. And, with what many people find surprising is that many of the
*01:56.040- 02:00.200* :  trends I think that they would assume to be going in the wrong direction or actually going in the
*02:00.200- 02:04.960* :  right direction. Why the world may not be quite as bad as we think it is.
*02:09.480- 02:15.460* :  The Venezuelan President Nicolas Madordo has ordered military exercises on the country's eastern
*02:15.460- 02:21.680* :  Caribbean and Atlantic coast in response to a British decision to send a warship to support
*02:21.680- 02:27.500* :  neighboring Guyana. The UK government took the decision after Venezuela renewed its claim to
*02:27.500- 02:33.580* :  an oil rich area which makes up about two-thirds of neighboring Guyana's territory. Mr. Madordo
*02:33.580- 02:41.920* :  made the announcement on television. I have ordered the activation of a joint action of the
*02:41.920- 02:49.040* :  entire Bolivarian national military force, a joint action of a defensive nature in response to
*02:49.040- 02:55.180* :  the provocation and threat of the United Kingdom against the peace and sovereignty of our country.
*02:55.520- 03:03.260* :  Nicolas Madordo, a recent controversial referendum suggested that 95% of voters were in favor
*03:03.260- 03:09.340* :  of establishing a new Venezuelan state in the territory. The BBC's Will Grant reports.
*03:09.340- 03:14.060* :  In a televised meeting of Venezuela's joint military chiefs, President Madordo called the
*03:14.060- 03:19.980* :  deployment of the British warship, HMS Trent, off Guyana's coast, practically a military threat by
*03:19.980- 03:25.320* :  London. It was he added against the spirit of a non-aggression agreement reached between
*03:25.320- 03:30.720* :  Caracas and Georgetown earlier this month. President Madordo then immediately ordered what he
*03:30.720- 03:36.220* :  called a joint defensive action off the coast of the disputed region by the country's armed forces.
*03:36.220- 03:42.340* :  He was told by the assembled military leaders that 5,600 personnel were ready to be deployed.
*03:42.380- 03:48.460* :  On sending HMS Trent to the Guyane's coast, the UK Defence Ministry issued a statement saying
*03:48.460- 03:54.080* :  it was part of a wider series of exercises in the region. However, in an emergency meeting in
*03:54.080- 03:59.960* :  St Vincent and the Grenadines two weeks ago, Guyana and Venezuela had agreed to avoid the use of force
*03:59.960- 04:04.000* :  over their decades-long border dispute. The argument over the oil-rich
*04:04.000- 04:09.840* :  s-equible region has been significantly ratcheted up in recent weeks after a referendum in Venezuela
*04:09.840- 04:15.720* :  called for Venezuelan sovereignty to be asserted over it. Guyana has repeatedly said the dispute
*04:15.720- 04:20.360* :  must be solved through the International Court of Justice, while Mr. Madordo's critics have
*04:20.360- 04:25.280* :  dismissed his actions as further saber-attling ahead of a presidential election next year.
*04:25.740- 04:30.040* :  Will Grant, there's been yet another mass movement of Palestinians in Gaza,
*04:30.620- 04:35.280* :  where civilians are trying to escape some of the fears as fighting in a war in one of the most
*04:35.280- 04:42.800* :  densely populated places in the world. The United Nations Relief Agency said there were 150,000
*04:42.800- 04:48.640* :  people being forcibly displaced by Israel from the center of the strip, where there's a large-scale
*04:48.640- 04:55.320* :  ground advance against Hamas. Israel insists its evacuation orders have been issued to protect
*04:55.320- 05:01.460* :  civilians. Our correspondent in Jerusalem, Shai Makalil, told me about the next phase of Israel's
*05:01.460- 05:07.540* :  operation to eradicate Hamas. It's a continuation of the massive ground offensive that we'd seen in
*05:08.060- 05:13.120* :  northern Gaza over the past couple of months, actually. The Israeli military has said that they
*05:13.120- 05:18.220* :  have near full control of the north, although it is still continuing their operations, but now
*05:18.220- 05:23.740* :  they're moving to central Gaza. The main area that they're talking about is three refugee camps,
*05:23.740- 05:29.380* :  and Nosirat, Burej, and Al-Marazi camps. The southern city of Hanyunis, it's been again
*05:29.380- 05:34.360* :  suffering heavy bombardment. There's also been a ground operation, and we've also had reports of
*05:34.360- 05:40.040* :  bombardment in Rafa in the past two days further south. As this ground operation can intensifies,
*05:40.040- 05:45.400* :  and deepens, Gaza's themselves, including babies and disabled people and young children,
*05:45.400- 05:50.500* :  they're running out of places to flee to to find safety. And according to the Hamas for
*05:50.500- 05:56.100* :  and health ministries, 70 people were killed in the Maghazir refugee camp. Israel has carried out
*05:56.100- 06:01.520* :  an inquiry, and how rare is it for Israel to express regret like this? I haven't heard it expressed
*06:01.520- 06:06.780* :  in that way. Let's just say that. This happened on December the 24th, late at night. It was an
*06:06.780- 06:12.760* :  airstrike that hit a number of buildings in a heavily populated residential block. We're now
*06:12.760- 06:16.420* :  hearing from the Hamas for and health ministry that the number is actually 86, and they always
*06:16.420- 06:20.680* :  said that the number is going to rise because bodies are still being pulled from the rubble.
*06:20.680- 06:26.100* :  The Israeli military have said that they hit two targets adjacent to our Hamas militants who are
*06:26.100- 06:30.500* :  operating, and a preliminary inquiry showed that further buildings nearby were hit, and that
*06:30.500- 06:35.940* :  this likely caused unintended harm to additional, uninvolved civilians. But yes, they expressed
*06:35.940- 06:39.680* :  regret, and they said they're drawing conclusions and learning lessons from the incident.
*06:40.220- 06:46.940* :  Shima Khalil. According to Israel, around 130 hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas during
*06:46.940- 06:53.140* :  the 7th of October attacks are still in Gaza. There were further demonstrations in Jerusalem
*06:53.140- 06:57.880* :  on Thursday, with protesters calling on the government to ensure their release.
*06:58.520- 07:03.620* :  I'm from Kibbutz Farazah, and my people were kidnapped. We want them back.
*07:03.920- 07:07.520* :  One of the chance earlier, they were listening off names, and I realized that one of the girls
*07:07.900- 07:11.340* :  said, uh, bring back dad instead of one of the names, and that hit really deep.
*07:12.060- 07:17.020* :  The BBC, another western news organizations, can't enter Gaza, and report freely,
*07:17.020- 07:22.960* :  because Israel tightly controls its access. But they have given some journalists the rare chance
*07:22.960- 07:29.840* :  to travel with the army into northern Gaza. Khazranaji from BBC Persian has just returned from being
*07:29.840- 07:36.080* :  allowed inside what Israel said was the largest tunnel it had discovered so far, which is part of a
*07:36.080- 07:40.880* :  huge underground network controlled by Hamas. He told me what it was like.
*07:41.380- 07:47.980* :  From a short distance away, it doesn't look like it's great discovery or a massive engineering
*07:47.980- 07:54.560* :  feat. They found the mouth of the tunnel in a sand dune, so you have to go down to get to the
*07:54.560- 08:01.040* :  mouth of the tunnel. And when you do get inside, it's impressive. It's big. You can drive a car
*08:01.340- 08:08.520* :  It's made of concrete. It's electrified. It's got all sorts of wires for electricity and other
*08:08.520- 08:16.140* :  amenities. And at first it goes down at a slope for about 50 meters deep. And then the tunnel
*08:16.440- 08:24.560* :  becomes a horizontal sort of a stretch with the other side opening onto northern part of the city
*08:24.560- 08:32.620* :  of Gaza. But we couldn't go further than 20-30 meters because the Israeli army said that it might
*08:32.620- 08:38.020* :  not be safe. And when we were there, it was dark in the tunnel. Of course, we had these soldiers
*08:38.560- 08:44.960* :  looking at the dark end of the tunnel with the machine guns and the fingers on the trigger,
*08:44.960- 08:52.400* :  holding torchlights as if they expected Hamas type to come out at any point from the darkness.
*08:52.960- 08:59.800* :  It still is not totally secure because I talked to a spokesman for the army and they said
*08:59.800- 09:06.300* :  because this tunnel has entrances from other tunnels, it's part of a big network, there may be
*09:06.300- 09:13.200* :  entrances that we have missed and we are being very cautious. I also talked to a Israeli officer
*09:13.200- 09:19.800* :  who is originally Iranian and he spoke to me in Persian. He was telling me that this tunnel
*09:19.800- 09:26.480* :  you can live, you can sleep, you can have a bath, you can go to the toilet, you can even hold
*09:26.480- 09:33.720* :  prisoners here for years without anybody from above noticing. He was referring to Israeli of course
*09:33.720- 09:41.020* :  drones that are flying all the time over Gaza and he was saying that we knew about this tunnel
*09:41.020- 09:46.560* :  but we didn't know how big it was because from above you can only see so much. And how key
*09:46.560- 09:51.540* :  do the Israelis believe that these tunnels are being to the way that Hamas have fought this war?
*09:51.660- 10:00.440* :  It looks as if the military ground incursion into Gaza is going a lot slower than expected
*10:00.440- 10:08.860* :  and is producing a lot of problems for Israelis and one reason for that is these very tunnels
*10:08.860- 10:15.080* :  that stretch throughout Gaza's strip and obviously they're using these tunnels to hide
*10:15.080- 10:21.840* :  them, come out, attack and go back into the tunnels and hide. So it's becoming more and more
*10:21.840- 10:30.880* :  difficult for Israelis to get further in their plan to clear these areas of Hamas and Islamic
*10:30.880- 10:38.440* :  jihad militants. It looks to me that these tunnels are becoming a major issue for their military
*10:39.600- 10:45.720* :  Kastranashi. Three weeks ago members of a drug cartel arrived in a town in central Mexico
*10:46.400- 10:51.860* :  to collect protection money from a group of local farmers. This is what happened next.
*11:00.360- 11:05.600* :  Footage shows dozens of people somewhere in cowboy hats attacking the gang members.
*11:06.160- 11:12.080* :  Fourteen people were killed. Ten of the members of the cartel, the familiar Michoacana.
*11:12.720- 11:17.140* :  A police investigation was carried out but now state prosecutors have decided
*11:17.140- 11:21.640* :  that the farm was acted in self-defense and won't face any charges.
*11:21.660- 11:29.160* :  A Latin America and Caribbean editor Vanessa Bushudler told me about the Michoacana cartel.
*11:29.500- 11:36.060* :  It's a gang that has been active for almost 20 years and its heyday was about 10, 15 years ago.
*11:36.060- 11:42.720* :  It has since splintered but it still holds sway in rural areas in Michoacana which is the state
*11:42.720- 11:48.100* :  that it's named after and also in Mexico state which is where this village is located,
*11:48.100- 11:52.800* :  Texcapilla, where this horrible incident happened three weeks ago.
*11:53.020- 11:58.140* :  And how common is it for those facing extortion from cartels to take matters into their own hands
*11:58.140- 12:03.320* :  like this? It is not very common because of the horrible reprisals that tend to happen.
*12:04.080- 12:09.320* :  These gangs are heavily armed so anyone standing up to them knows that they could face death.
*12:09.700- 12:15.220* :  In this case it was very unusual because the locals managed to kill ten of the gang members
*12:15.620- 12:20.720* :  including one of the leaders of the gang who goes by the name of El Payaso meaning the clown in Spanish.
*12:20.880- 12:26.160* :  The footage does show an incredibly violent battle and I suppose from the farmer's point of view
*12:26.160- 12:32.200* :  they were incredibly brave. Absolutely especially if you then find out as we have since
*12:32.200- 12:38.660* :  from the prosecutor's office that the weapons that the farmers wielded where I quote tools
*12:38.660- 12:45.500* :  of their trade so it was machetes, sides, some shotguns but not the kind of arms that the cartel
*12:45.500- 12:51.520* :  would have wielded. So very brave indeed but it has to be said there have been reprisals since
*12:52.180- 12:58.560* :  fourteen local people have been abducted and it is presumed that these people were seized
*12:58.560- 13:03.340* :  by this gang as a reprisal in revenge for what happened on that day.
*13:03.800- 13:09.140* :  Vanessa Bouchertler, 12 Chinese military aircraft were detected off Taiwan on Thursday
*13:09.140- 13:14.020* :  and now the government there is accused China of mounting a huge misinformation campaign
*13:14.020- 13:19.800* :  to try and influence the island's presidential election which takes place in just over two weeks time.
*13:20.680- 13:26.180* :  China views Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually come under Beijing's control.
*13:27.020- 13:31.700* :  It accused Taipei of trying to stoke confrontation and manipulate the election.
*13:32.360- 13:38.560* :  Taiwan's ruling democratic progressive party is hoping to win an unprecedented third presidential
*13:38.560- 13:44.740* :  term. As our Taiwan correspondent Rupert Wingfield Hayes reports it's not just political pressure
*13:45.180- 13:50.780* :  that China is exerting. It's 6am at a fighter base on the west coast of Taiwan.
*13:53.280- 13:59.020* :  Three sleek mirage fighter jets are on the taxiway. They're from Taiwan's rapid reaction squadron
*13:59.540- 14:02.680* :  tasked with meeting any incoming threats to the island's airspace.
*14:04.720- 14:07.940* :  Seconds later the brakes are released and they roar down the runway.
*14:10.280- 14:16.500* :  These Taiwanese fighter jets being scrambled here are heading out into the Taiwan's straight
*14:16.500- 14:22.860* :  to confront Chinese aircraft that are coming across the straight and probing Taiwan's airspace.
*14:23.720- 14:27.040* :  This is now happening multiple times every day.
*14:30.840- 14:36.500* :  In any single day China now regularly sends 10 or more aircraft across the median line that
*14:36.500- 14:41.120* :  divides the Taiwan's straight but when Beijing wants to turn up the tension it can send
*14:41.120- 14:47.080* :  scores of aircraft. On one day in September there were over a hundred and it's not just in the air.
*14:47.440- 14:53.400* :  On a hill on the southern tip of Taiwan navy veteran Shu Gun Re is setting up a 5 meter long radio
*14:53.400- 15:00.700* :  antenna. Shu tunes his set to the channel used by Taiwan's navy and coast guard.
*15:01.360- 15:04.680* :  Within minutes we pick up a transmission from the Chinese navy.
*15:09.540- 15:13.820* :  That's the Chinese navy talking to the Taiwanese navy saying your territorial waters
*15:14.360- 15:19.520* :  do not exist that the people's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China
*15:19.520- 15:26.080* :  and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. At its home in Taipei I meet up with Admiral Li
*15:26.080- 15:33.460* :  Xi Min. Until 2019 Admiral Li was the commander of Taiwan's armed forces. He says China's so-called
*15:33.460- 15:38.820* :  grey zone warfare tactics have multiple aims. One is to intimidate the island's voters.
*15:39.380- 15:42.260* :  Another is to send a warning to Taiwan's allies.
*15:42.740- 15:49.920* :  I think China is sending a very strong signal to the United States that Taiwan is part of China
*15:50.280- 15:55.500* :  but in the meantime it can use this kind of aggression to make Taiwanese people
*15:55.500- 16:03.720* :  scare and make Taiwanese people capitulate. People are increasingly worried about the threat
*16:04.160- 16:08.720* :  but at this election rally in Taipei I found supporters of the frontrunner to win Taiwan's
*16:08.720- 16:15.680* :  presidency in defined mood. I'm very worried but I'm not afraid because I won't be a volunteer
*16:15.680- 16:22.880* :  to be a soldier. Vent our beautiful country. I'm worried about this but if someday we may be
*16:22.880- 16:28.560* :  war I'm not afraid because I think I'm Taiwanese I need to protect my country.
*16:30.780- 16:35.760* :  Back on the coast the jets are returning from their morning patrol. Another aim of China's
*16:35.760- 16:41.380* :  grey zone warfare is to wear out Taiwan's small fleet of modern military jets and to exhaust
*16:41.380- 16:49.240* :  its pilots and experts say that may be working. Taiwan has fewer than 300 jets. China has more than
*16:49.240- 16:55.400* :  2000. Whoever becomes Taiwan's next president will face a military balance tipping ever more
*16:55.400- 17:04.620* :  in China's favor. Rupert Wingfield Hayes. If you listen to or watch the news on a regular basis
*17:05.280- 17:09.760* :  you could be forgiven for thinking the world is a bleak place with the current conflicts
*17:09.760- 17:16.360* :  climate change and the threat posed by artificial intelligence but the data doesn't always
*17:16.360- 17:21.560* :  back that up. Dr. Hannah Ritchie is the deputy editor of the online publication
*17:21.660- 17:27.980* :  Our World in Data. Vivi Anunis spoke to her about her new book Not the End of the World.
*17:28.640- 17:33.440* :  It's been published next month and then it she argues that if we really look closely at the data
*17:33.940- 17:38.920* :  the world starts to look a little brighter. The headlines they tend to be quite eye-grabbing
*17:38.920- 17:44.780* :  events and those tend to be negative so it's a disaster, a war, a recession. So if we're trying to
*17:44.780- 17:49.440* :  build a world view purely based on what we see in the news I think it would tend more negative
*17:49.440- 17:54.200* :  than what the data would actually show. But you can't truly build up a picture of what's happening
*17:54.200- 18:00.920* :  to 8 billion people around the world just based on small stories alone. And I think what many people
*18:00.920- 18:05.380* :  find surprising is that many of the trends I think that they would assume to be going in the wrong
*18:05.380- 18:10.820* :  direction are actually going in the right direction. Yeah so tell us some examples where what we think
*18:10.820- 18:17.000* :  we know is quite far removed from what the data tells us. One is extreme poverty. If you ask people
*18:17.000- 18:21.740* :  how is extreme poverty around the world changing they assume that it's going up but if you go back
*18:21.740- 18:28.280* :  to say 1820 around 80% of the world lived in extreme poverty. Now over the last few centuries
*18:28.280- 18:33.780* :  we've seen a dramatic decline such that it's now less than 10% which is obviously still far too
*18:33.780- 18:38.880* :  high but we have seen this dramatic decline in improvement across the world in extreme poverty.
*18:39.480- 18:43.700* :  I have a good other example there is and this is from my background as an environmentalist I think
*18:43.700- 18:49.060* :  when we look at the news media we assume that there must be the most people dying from extreme
*18:49.060- 18:53.480* :  weather and disasters. But when you look at the long term data on this sale over the last century
*18:53.480- 18:58.940* :  we've seen a significant decline in deaths from disasters. Now that's not because climate change
*18:58.940- 19:04.120* :  isn't real or that disasters aren't intensifying it's because we've become much more resilient to
*19:04.120- 19:08.600* :  them and part of this comes into the poverty story where as we've got richer as we've developed
*19:08.600- 19:13.760* :  technologies say early warning systems and more resilient infrastructure we've managed to
*19:13.760- 19:19.220* :  decrease deaths from disasters despite there being more intense. I think it's very clear from the
*19:19.220- 19:23.520* :  data that we're moving far too slowly on climate change and we need to accelerate but I think there
*19:23.520- 19:27.680* :  are some good news stories in there and I think when we come to talk about climate change I think
*19:27.680- 19:31.640* :  we need to stress the urgency and scale of the problem but I think we also need to put emphasis
*19:31.640- 19:36.080* :  on the solutions. If we only communicate how bad things are then people become paralyzed and
*19:36.080- 19:40.080* :  we need to show people solutions and I mean for example in rich countries we've seen this
*19:40.080- 19:45.700* :  has significant decline in emissions over the last few decades so in the UK most of our electricity
*19:45.740- 19:51.500* :  used to come from coal and we're now essentially coal free and I think really positive trends that we've
*19:51.500- 19:57.400* :  seen in particular is the plummeting cost of low carbon technologies such that solar or wind
*19:57.400- 20:01.820* :  are now cheaper than fossil fuels. I guess from your point of view it's encouraging
*20:01.860- 20:08.400* :  media organisations including the BBC to take a more data rich approach to reporting the world
*20:08.400- 20:13.080* :  around us. How do you encourage journalists and media organisations to do that? I think journalism
*20:13.080- 20:19.200* :  will always be based around stories and headlines I think that's what many people come to the news for
*20:19.400- 20:24.880* :  but I also think it's important is to try and to give some context around those problems so if
*20:24.880- 20:30.480* :  there's a disaster in a particular region it's useful to use the data to give context is this
*20:30.580- 20:36.440* :  common how common is it is this disaster worse than in the past and also stress what the
*20:36.440- 20:40.980* :  solutions to that are so one is trying to address climate change obviously but there are also
*20:40.980- 20:46.040* :  solutions on the adaptation and resilience side such that people get a much more complete picture
*20:46.040- 20:49.920* :  of what's going on and it's not just an isolated event that they're seeing in the news.
*20:50.420- 20:53.180* :  Dr Hannah Richie speaking to Vivian Nunes
*20:56.100- 20:58.080* :  Still to come on the global news podcast
*20:58.600- 21:05.520* :  58 beetles, four crabs, some worms that eat whale bones and the largest penguin that ever lived
*21:05.520- 21:10.040* :  weighed 150 kilograms three times the weight of the current largest penguin.
*21:10.520- 21:14.740* :  We hear about a bumper year for discoveries of new species around the world.
*21:23.500- 21:32.060* :  Church leaders in the Democratic Republic of Congo say they found numerous cases of irregularities
*21:32.440- 21:38.200* :  during the recent elections which were extended over several days because of administrative chaos
*21:39.040- 21:44.580* :  at a news conference in Kinshasa an election observation mission run by the Catholic and
*21:44.580- 21:50.640* :  Protestant churches also raised questions about the legality of the shambolic voting process.
*21:51.280- 21:54.120* :  Here's our Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton.
*21:54.740- 22:00.400* :  The Catholic Protestant Observer Mission said there'd be numerous cases of irregularities
*22:00.840- 22:04.160* :  which were likely to have affected the integrity of the results.
*22:05.060- 22:09.660* :  Voting was officially extended by a day to account for logistical problems
*22:09.660- 22:14.080* :  but continued for days afterwards in some remote areas.
*22:14.960- 22:20.700* :  In its preliminary report the Observer Mission suggested that officially extending the vote
*22:20.700- 22:27.140* :  by one day contravened electoral laws. Partial results released from the Electoral Commission
*22:27.140- 22:34.480* :  showed the incumbent President Felix Shishikedi as well ahead with nearly 80% of the ballots
*22:34.480- 22:40.980* :  counted so far. Richard Hamilton, now to a case that's made front page headlines in India.
*22:41.580- 22:46.600* :  Back in October, according Qatar sentenced eight Indian former naval officers to death.
*22:46.620- 22:52.340* :  The specific charges laid against them weren't revealed but reports in the Indian media after
*22:52.340- 22:58.280* :  their arrest last year suggested they were suspected of spying for Israel. Now their death sentences
*22:58.300- 23:05.060* :  have been commuted. Our South Asian correspondent Ambarisan at Aarajan gave me more details from Delhi.
*23:05.560- 23:10.660* :  They were working for a private security company and they were working closely with the Qatar
*23:10.660- 23:17.060* :  Defence Forces in August 2022 according to some of these family members. They were arrested and
*23:17.060- 23:22.440* :  taken by the Qatari Forces and for a long time many people did not know what happened to them.
*23:22.640- 23:27.680* :  Even now, neither the Qatari officials nor the Indian authorities have clearly
*23:27.680- 23:32.040* :  spelled out what the charges were but they were kept in prison when they went to the
*23:32.040- 23:37.180* :  court in April this year and in October the court gave the death penalty for all of them.
*23:37.180- 23:42.720* :  That really shook many people here in India because people did not know what the charges were.
*23:43.200- 23:48.000* :  So there were a lot of speculations and one of them being they were spying for Israel but we don't
*23:48.000- 23:52.860* :  know. These were only floating around in the media. So because Indian government is like growing
*23:52.860- 23:57.660* :  in terms of stature around the world and the economy, people were taken by a surprise how come
*23:57.660- 24:03.200* :  a Gulf nation was able to arrest these people and why the government was not providing
*24:03.200- 24:08.660* :  consular access but according to what the government is saying the Indian Prime Minister Modi met
*24:08.660- 24:14.700* :  the Qatari emir in a recent conference and that really set the ball rolling and now the Indian
*24:14.700- 24:19.320* :  foreign ministry says that the death sentence have been commuted but again they do not know the
*24:19.320- 24:24.800* :  full judgment and they don't want to comment at this point. I'm Barossa Netarajan. A Michelin
*24:24.800- 24:30.820* :  star chef has left his job at a five star hotel in southwestern France where a kitchen worker
*24:30.820- 24:38.160* :  was reportedly abused in an initiation ritual or alien la joe ran the gourmet restaurant
*24:38.160- 24:44.460* :  at the hotel du Palais in Birits. Our Europe regional editor Danny Abahad has more details.
*24:51.100- 24:57.160* :  In its words a unique experience in which they can save a sophisticated and contemporary French
*24:57.160- 25:03.160* :  cuisine but the chef it's named after has moved on. Local media have linked this to an incident
*25:03.160- 25:09.280* :  earlier this month. It said footage that appeared temporarily online showed a kitchen hands tied up
*25:09.280- 25:16.680* :  naked to a chair humiliated while others looked on. The BBC has not seen it. The hired which runs
*25:16.680- 25:21.860* :  the hotel du Palais said its management had investigated what it called concerning allegations
*25:21.860- 25:27.780* :  and imagery of an incident that did not as it put it reflect the strong values it stands for.
*25:28.700- 25:34.960* :  It said appropriate decisions had been taken without specifying what. The BBC has tried to contact
*25:34.960- 25:39.860* :  or alien la joe who was named as one of the greats of tomorrow by the French gastronomic guide
*25:39.860- 25:45.620* :  Goi Mioe for comment. He's told French media that reports of the incident at defamatory
*25:46.500- 25:51.000* :  describing them as a monstrous attack on his honour. Prosecutors have opened a preliminary
*25:51.000- 25:56.980* :  investigation into possible violence and sexual abuse but stressed that so far at least they have
*25:56.980- 26:04.640* :  not received a formal complaint. Danny Abahad. The Amazon is famously described as the lungs of
*26:04.640- 26:11.480* :  the world. In the past year deforestation in Brazil's reign forests has fallen dramatically. Plenty
*26:11.480- 26:16.160* :  of work has been done to try and protect them since President Lula de Silva was elected.
*26:16.920- 26:22.920* :  Under his predecessor, Jai Bolsonaro, it was a different story. The far right president sought
*26:22.920- 26:27.900* :  to develop the world's biggest rainforest at the expense of the environment. But now,
*26:27.900- 26:33.740* :  with Lula in power, has the threat towards the Amazon and its people gone away or at least
*26:33.740- 26:38.600* :  receded. Our South America correspondent Katie Watson has been finding out.
*26:40.540- 26:44.180* :  Brazil's reign forest has been through some difficult years of late
*26:44.700- 26:50.940* :  and the former leader Jai Bolsonaro, deforestation, sought to a 15-year high. He gave the green light
*26:50.940- 26:56.080* :  to loggers and branches who cleared vast swathes of land by setting fire to it.
*26:57.720- 27:03.980* :  In August 2019, I saw it for myself. Thousands of miles away in São Paulo, the smoke from the
*27:03.980- 27:11.860* :  Amazon descended, turning the city dark. Us forward to 2022 and Lula de Silva was very clear and
*27:11.860- 27:18.620* :  he ran for president that things needed to change. We need to look after our forest. He told
*27:18.620- 27:23.380* :  those of us who followed him to the Amazon's largest city manouse on the campaign trail.
*27:23.380- 27:28.520* :  But he added more than that, we need to look after our people in the forest because they're suffering
*27:29.020- 27:30.880* :  and they need to live a dignified life.
*27:33.960- 27:39.140* :  And this year Brazil took its largest ever delegation to COP28 in the United Arab Emirates.
*27:39.620- 27:45.520* :  In 2025, it'll be bringing the event to the Amazon itself. But Lula has come in for some criticism
*27:45.520- 27:51.040* :  here in Brazil because of his insistence in exploring for more oil despite his rhetoric of
*27:51.040- 27:57.020* :  saving the rainforest and its people. Hakeel Tupinamba is an indigenous activist from the
*27:57.020- 28:03.860* :  Tapajos region of the Amazon who is at COP herself. President Lula defends some economic
*28:03.860- 28:09.720* :  activities that represent the death of territories and their people, like Kaya and gas exploration.
*28:10.160- 28:13.900* :  Within the territory are very close to indigenous people here in the Amazon.
*28:13.900- 28:19.540* :  But says fellow community activist Latissa Santiago, the president is up against some formidable
*28:19.540- 28:26.300* :  challenges. There are political games and interests. Beyond Lula, we also have a very
*28:26.300- 28:31.380* :  powerful rural lobby within the Senate, which has made life very difficult for environmental
*28:31.420- 28:35.460* :  people to move forward. I've come to the capital, Brazilia.
*28:37.660- 28:41.580* :  I'm here to meet Brazil's first indigenous minister, Sonia Guajajara.
*28:41.720- 28:47.180* :  What do you say to the young activists who feel they've got a lot of work to do and perhaps it's too late?
*28:48.220- 28:52.960* :  They need to keep fighting. I arrived here in this position to fight this fight.
*28:53.780- 28:58.140* :  I continue with the same arguments. Young people can play the role of mobilizer,
*28:58.140- 29:03.560* :  of articulator, and the fend of future. The world is watching Brazil with Lula's narrative
*29:03.560- 29:09.300* :  of saving the forest, but after it hosts COP and the spotlight goes away. What then?
*29:09.360- 29:15.580* :  activist Valesca Kiros is from the coastal Amazon city of Bele, where Brazil's COP is going to be held.
*29:17.020- 29:22.040* :  What do you remain for the people after the event finished? Given all the problems facing our
*29:22.040- 29:28.220* :  sitting in the Amazon, I hope is a way of showing the power that we have and understanding that power.
*29:29.720- 29:34.720* :  The power of the Amazon and its people are trying to win back control of the forest that
*29:34.720- 29:37.820* :  sustains them and convince the world of their wealth.
*29:40.320- 29:46.000* :  Katie Watson. Finally, scientists at the Natural History Museum here in London have documented
*29:46.060- 29:53.860* :  a record-breaking 815 new species on the planet over the past year, but you might be surprised to
*29:53.860- 30:00.060* :  learn that more than 600 of them are a species of wasp, and most of them parasitic.
*30:00.740- 30:04.700* :  Ledan Arthur who spoke to the TV presenter and conservationist Chris Packham
*30:05.240- 30:08.860* :  and asked him if more parasitic wasps are what the world really needs.
*30:09.400- 30:15.120* :  Well, yes, they do, because those wasps are primarily parasites, as you say, and they have been
*30:15.120- 30:21.220* :  used as a form of biological control, so many of these species lay their eggs into the developing
*30:21.220- 30:27.100* :  larvae of other species, which can be pest. So it's estimated that in the last 50 years or so,
*30:27.280- 30:31.860* :  using these wasps has benefited millions reinflated economies and secured
*30:32.420- 30:37.180* :  livelihoods for lots of people. So understanding and knowing about these creatures can
*30:37.180- 30:41.480* :  play a productive role in keeping the world a safe place, including a safe place for humans.
*30:41.740- 30:47.880* :  So more than 600 new species of wasps, about 800 odd species in total described by the Natural
*30:47.880- 30:53.820* :  History Museum this year. What were the others? 58 beetles, four crabs, some worms that eat whale
*30:53.820- 30:59.980* :  bones, and the largest penguin that ever lived. So obviously a fossil from 50 million years ago weighed
*30:59.980- 31:05.740* :  150 kilograms, so three times the weight of the current largest penguin, the emperor penguin.
*31:05.880- 31:10.660* :  When we're talking about new species, this is not all people rushing out into remote places across
*31:10.660- 31:15.080* :  the planet. Some of them are from specimens that have been in museums for years, that have been overlooked.
*31:15.580- 31:20.480* :  Others are what we call DNA splits. So we think that we've got one species, but developing technology
*31:20.480- 31:24.900* :  allows us to look a little more carefully at its DNA, and we realize that we've got two, three, four.
*31:25.280- 31:29.200* :  But this year has been spectacular. I have to say, electric blue tarantulas from Thailand,
*31:29.200- 31:34.720* :  pygmy squid from Japan, frogs from Tanzania, entirely chameleons from Tanzania as well.
*31:34.960- 31:39.840* :  Now many of the species we've been discussing, very sad to say, are already in danger.
*31:39.840- 31:45.240* :  The iridescent tarantula from Thailand is losing its habitat. Those frogs and chameleons from
*31:45.240- 31:51.420* :  Tanzania, deforestation is a problem for those animals as well. We know that more than a million
*31:51.420- 31:57.600* :  species are endangered. So as much as an HM have named 815 new ones this year, we're going to be
*31:57.600- 32:01.760* :  losing species more quickly than they can name them. But I can tell you, there is still some
*32:01.760- 32:07.020* :  exciting scientists going out and finding things in the forest. So recently, a new hedgehog species
*32:07.020- 32:11.560* :  that dwells in the forest of eastern China has been described. They knew that there were these
*32:11.820- 32:15.500* :  species living there for other known species, but they went out. They found another one. They
*32:15.500- 32:19.120* :  looked at it. They thought it looked a little bit smaller. Its ears were different. Again, DNA
*32:19.120- 32:24.460* :  came to the rescue when it came to separating them. Across the world, there were 17 known species
*32:24.460- 32:29.940* :  of hedgehogs, and now there are 18. So there are still things out there to be discovered by the
*32:29.940- 32:33.280* :  Indiana Joneses of the zoological world. Chris Packham
*32:36.260- 32:40.760* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*32:40.760- 32:46.720* :  later. And as we head towards the new year, we want to hear about stories which are important to you
*32:46.720- 32:52.980* :  that we can maybe feature on the podcast in 2024. If you have something you think others will be
*32:52.980- 32:58.240* :  interested in and the BBC could possibly report on, then send us an email with the details.
*32:58.240- 33:06.980* :  The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on X, formerly known as Twitter
