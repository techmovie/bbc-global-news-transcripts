*01:32.080- 01:38.360* :  I'm Nigel Adely and of the early hours of Saturday, the 30th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:39.260- 01:42.320* :  On the day of Russia's heaviest aerial bombardment of Ukraine,
*01:42.320- 01:45.520* :  President Zelensky appeals for more Western support.
*01:45.520- 01:50.420* :  This is yet another sign for our partners to strengthen Ukraine with the air defense we need
*01:50.420- 01:55.060* :  to become the shield between the aggressor and Europe. We are capable of protecting us all,
*01:55.060- 02:01.120* :  just give us the means to do so. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, as tens of
*02:01.120- 02:06.720* :  thousands more refugees flee the Israeli offensive. We've been asking for help for three months.
*02:07.520- 02:12.340* :  Nobody is listening to us. We're saying that again, help us. That's enough.
*02:12.380- 02:18.600* :  President Malay continues his radical agenda in Argentina by pulling the country out of the
*02:18.600- 02:28.040* :  Brex group of nations. And news are presented. Julian Marshall meets someone who sounds very
*02:28.040- 02:33.820* :  familiar. Hello, real Julian. I'm AI Julian. How are you today? I'm here to steal your job.
*02:33.920- 02:37.480* :  Do you have any tips that could help me improve my presenting skills?
*02:44.180- 02:47.640* :  Ukraine has stressed the need for continued support from the West,
*02:48.100- 02:53.140* :  following a massive wave of Russian missile strikes that has left at least 30 people dead
*02:53.140- 02:58.700* :  and caused huge material damage. It's the largest aerial assault on the country
*02:59.220- 03:05.340* :  since Russia invaded in February last year. More than 150 drones and missiles were fired.
*03:06.100- 03:10.800* :  Some were brought down by Ukraine's air defenses, but many still got through.
*03:11.460- 03:17.420* :  Schools, hospitals and residential areas were among those hit. Our first report is from our
*03:17.420- 03:23.620* :  correspondent James Waterhouse in Kiev. It was a sunrise which brought three powerful explosions.
*03:24.440- 03:28.720* :  One of the areas hit was a warehouse which had been hollowed out from front to back.
*03:29.480- 03:34.860* :  Nearby glass had been blown off the entire side of a skyscraper. It's a level of devastation,
*03:34.860- 03:39.400* :  only caused by direct missile strike. Maria lives nearby.
*03:42.980- 03:48.560* :  I was woken up at half past seven by a horrible sound. It was so frightening. The missile was
*03:48.600- 03:54.320* :  flying and everything was buzzing so noisy. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to run down to the
*03:54.320- 03:59.880* :  shelter. I thought of running into the bathroom and as I went there, the mirror flew off the wall
*03:59.900- 04:05.120* :  with such force that if it happened a moment earlier, I'd have cuts all over.
*04:05.680- 04:10.000* :  Kiev could have been forgiven for thinking raids such as this had become a thing of the past with
*04:10.000- 04:15.540* :  its improved air defenses, but the breadth and scale of this attack means it's likely they were
*04:15.540- 04:21.480* :  overwhelmed. Leviv in the west, Sumi in the north, Harkeven in the northeast, Nipro in the east,
*04:21.480- 04:28.160* :  and Odessa in the south were all hit by hypersonic and ballistic missiles as well as Iranian
*04:28.700- 04:34.800* :  drones. As Kiev's mayor Vitaly Klitsko points out, with the final approved U.S. military
*04:34.800- 04:40.480* :  package arriving this week, Ukraine's ability to keep defending itself is far from assured.
*04:40.900- 04:48.800* :  Russia has huge resources and we are limited. Please stay to support Ukraine and please never
*04:48.800- 04:54.800* :  forget. We're defending right now, not just our houses and our land. We're defending
*04:54.800- 05:00.420* :  one of you. Ukraine's Air Force claimed it had never seen so many incoming missiles in a single
*05:00.420- 05:07.000* :  attack. In a war where Moscow routinely strikes cities, it can't occupy. That is saying something.
*05:07.420- 05:13.740* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev. The U.S. President Joe Biden has said the assault is renewed proof
*05:14.240- 05:19.280* :  that President Putin must be stopped and has called on the U.S. Congress to step up.
*05:19.940- 05:23.420* :  It's so far block-sending around $60 billion to Ukraine.
*05:24.260- 05:29.500* :  Brett had announced on Friday it was sending around 200 air defense missiles to the country
*05:30.040- 05:34.500* :  in response to what it called Russia's latest wave of murderous air strikes.
*05:34.920- 05:40.580* :  With the second anniversary of the war approaching, our correspondent Gordon Carrera has been looking
*05:40.580- 05:46.220* :  at how tactics on both sides are developing. It had been long feared that Russia had been
*05:46.220- 05:51.680* :  stockpiling missiles, for an air assault large enough to overcome Ukraine's anti-aircraft
*05:51.680- 05:56.900* :  defenses. But the real target of the strike was not so much the buildings that were hit,
*05:57.460- 06:01.900* :  but Ukraine's morale. Neither side has managed a major breakthrough with its
*06:01.900- 06:07.380* :  offensives on the ground in recent months, despite heavy losses. Russia has made some small gains
*06:07.380- 06:13.900* :  recently, but a decisive shift seems unlikely, and so the challenge for each side now is trying
*06:13.900- 06:19.480* :  to outlast the other and carry out operations which exact a psychological toll.
*06:20.420- 06:24.700* :  Ukraine knows that it's faced with an adversary with more manpower and resources.
*06:24.700- 06:31.060* :  It hopes that tactical successes, like the strike on a Russian navy landing ship three days ago,
*06:31.500- 06:35.000* :  can provide a sense that it is still able to inflict damage on Russia.
*06:35.740- 06:40.460* :  That is vital to ensure it can mobilize domestic and wider international support.
*06:41.400- 06:45.760* :  Moscow meanwhile will be hoping that the sheer scale of this wave of air attacks
*06:45.760- 06:51.280* :  will be enough to shake Ukrainian resolve by making the population across the country
*06:51.680- 06:55.000* :  question whether they can be protected. Gordon Carrera
*06:55.880- 07:01.400* :  The UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees says more than 300 people are being killed
*07:01.940- 07:08.300* :  while taking refuge in UN shelters in Gaza since the war began. The UN humanitarian chief
*07:08.300- 07:12.940* :  Martin Griffiths says the situation is not only impossible for people in Gaza,
*07:12.940- 07:18.340* :  but for those trying to help them as well. His comments come as Israeli forces expand
*07:18.340- 07:23.780* :  their offensive in the southern city of Khan units, driving more Palestinians into Rafa,
*07:24.380- 07:29.780* :  which is already overcrowded and is also being bombed. At least 20 people are said to have
*07:29.780- 07:36.160* :  been killed there and dozens injured after an Israeli air strike. This resident was there when
*07:36.160- 07:43.060* :  Rafa was hit. We were sleeping at home and we suddenly heard an explosion and the stone started
*07:43.060- 07:48.600* :  falling, so I opened the window and I heard the neighbours calling for help, so we came and found
*07:48.600- 07:54.720* :  out a two floor building that was full with displaced people, women and children collapsed on them.
*07:55.500- 08:00.920* :  Nobody is listening to us. We are saying that again, help us. That is enough.
*08:02.040- 08:08.020* :  Peace talks are continuing. Egypt and Qatar met a Hamas delegation in Cairo on Friday
*08:08.060- 08:13.800* :  in a renewed effort to stop the fighting. But with the Israeli government saying their mission
*08:13.800- 08:20.240* :  is at an essential stage and Hamas refusing to release their remaining hostages whilst under fire,
*08:20.860- 08:26.540* :  any diplomatic solution seems some way off. We'll hear more about those talks in Egypt shortly,
*08:27.200- 08:30.520* :  but first I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem, Shima Khalil,
*08:30.520- 08:36.840* :  what the situation was like in Rafa. Very bad. And remember, Rafa is extremely crucial. It's the
*08:36.840- 08:41.880* :  southernmost part of Gaza. Again, extremely overcrowded because at the beginning of the conflict,
*08:41.880- 08:47.180* :  many people went south to Khan units and in Rafa. But also this is the area bordering Egypt where
*08:47.180- 08:51.620* :  the Rafa crossing and the Karim Shalom crossings are and this is normally where aid comes in.
*08:51.620- 08:56.420* :  It's been very difficult because of the continued bombardment, a very, very small town,
*08:56.420- 09:01.260* :  thousands and thousands of people coming in, not very much space. But as it becomes very
*09:01.260- 09:06.000* :  densely populated, there is bombardment on that area at the moment. And we have heard about the
*09:06.000- 09:10.640* :  potential peace talks in Cairo. How much hope is there for those? Each side is looking at this
*09:10.640- 09:15.300* :  quite skeptically and with a great deal of mistrust. We haven't heard official responses from either,
*09:15.300- 09:20.900* :  but I think Egypt is watching this very carefully trying with this proposal to present it in three
*09:20.900- 09:26.680* :  phases that would see the gradual release of hostages that would see periods of pauses in the
*09:26.680- 09:31.540* :  fighting that could lead to a ceasefire. They've also proposed this governing body of technocrats
*09:31.540- 09:37.520* :  of experts to administer Gaza. But with these two sides so entrenched in their positions at the moment,
*09:37.520- 09:43.080* :  it's a huge gap to try and bridge, but also I think if, and it's still a big if, if they agree
*09:43.080- 09:49.140* :  in principle, it's going to be a long drawn out process to negotiate every single detail of that
*09:49.140- 09:55.840* :  proposed agreement. In Israel, many of the survivors of the Hamas attacks of the 7th of October
*09:56.480- 10:00.320* :  and released hostages have been trying to come to terms with their raw deals.
*10:01.340- 10:06.560* :  Renuna Aitan is the head of psychiatry at the Itchilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv.
*10:07.180- 10:12.300* :  She's been helping some of the released hostages and told Rebecca Kesby more about what they've
*10:12.460- 10:19.580* :  been through. Most of them were held in inhumane sanitary conditions subject to starvation,
*10:19.580- 10:26.440* :  to beating sexual abuse. Some of them were held in solitary confinement and we know that some
*10:26.440- 10:33.560* :  also spend long times underground in total darkness until they develop severe hallucinations
*10:33.560- 10:40.120* :  and other mental symptoms. They were forced to watch brutal videos and this really can affect
*10:40.120- 10:46.240* :  a child. They were under constant threats with weapons and many of them they're afraid they
*10:46.240- 10:52.120* :  cannot sleep during the night. They have nightmares. Some of them get into dissociative states.
*10:52.120- 10:55.760* :  They feel that they're back in the captivity in Gaza.
*10:56.420- 11:00.340* :  You mentioned that some of the people you're treating are children and also that
*11:00.340- 11:06.000* :  people have been subject to sexual violence. Some of the children actually witnessed that too,
*11:06.220- 11:13.180* :  yes. I'm a psychiatrist now over 20 years and I've never seen such a deliberate and brutal
*11:13.180- 11:18.960* :  abuse of children. Another problem is that some children and adolescents and also adults
*11:18.960- 11:24.800* :  they were given psychiatric drugs in order to control them. So the impact of going through a
*11:24.800- 11:30.660* :  traumatic event under the influence of specific drugs, we actually don't know what it's going to be
*11:30.660- 11:37.300* :  like. Let's say we have to rewrite the textbook now of trauma. Since October 7th,
*11:37.360- 11:43.860* :  there is a huge increase in people that come over to the ER of the hospital and we opened a
*11:43.960- 11:49.240* :  specific clinic to treat the patients that come with post-traumatic symptoms and we have seen
*11:49.240- 11:56.060* :  hundreds of patients. People from southern Israel, they experience terrible traumatic events during
*11:56.060- 12:02.260* :  October 7th, they have their own traumatic memories and on top of that now they hear what happened
*12:02.260- 12:08.600* :  to those unfortunate hostages that were taken to Gaza. And when you look at the scenes that we've
*12:08.600- 12:14.420* :  seen coming out of Gaza too and particularly for the children living in Gaza who have been displaced,
*12:14.420- 12:20.060* :  witnessed awful things, the destruction, the death of family members, what would be your concerns
*12:20.060- 12:27.060* :  about what their trauma might be like in the future. I'm sure that like the whole generation here
*12:27.060- 12:34.940* :  in Israel, living both in Gaza and all over Israel, they're all going to have severe post-traumatic
*12:34.980- 12:41.040* :  symptoms as health providers will have to take the responsibility. It's going to take years,
*12:41.180- 12:45.720* :  it's not on during the first year, usually the second year is the worst.
*12:46.160- 12:52.960* :  Renuna Aitan speaking to Rebecca Kesby. Two major aid organizations have paused their operations
*12:52.960- 13:00.320* :  in Sudan's embattled El Gazeera State because of looting. The state capital fell to the paramilitary
*13:00.320- 13:07.300* :  rapid support forces this month. Will Leonardo reports? As Sudan's devastating civil war grinds on
*13:07.300- 13:11.960* :  aid agencies say looting is making it hard to operate in areas that need them the most.
*13:12.280- 13:16.940* :  The UN's world food program said its warehouse in El Gazeera with supplies to feed one and a half
*13:16.940- 13:22.300* :  million people was targeted. A WFP official said Sudanese civilians had been robbed of critical
*13:22.300- 13:27.540* :  assistance. The medical charity MSF said armed men had attacked its compound in the state capital
*13:27.540- 13:33.100* :  Werd Mardani taking cars and other items. Its staff are now being evacuated to safer areas.
*13:33.700- 13:37.720* :  The city had become a refuge for civilians fleeing from other contested areas of Sudan.
*13:37.900- 13:43.540* :  Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the RSF offensive many for a second time.
*13:43.540- 13:49.300* :  Will Leonardo. Two days before Argentina were due to join the BRICS group of nations,
*13:49.420- 13:55.100* :  they've pulled out. The new president Javier Millet sent a letter to the leaders of Brazil,
*13:55.100- 14:01.000* :  Russia, India, China and South Africa going back on the plans of his left wing predecessor.
*14:01.920- 14:07.740* :  The BRICS grouping is often seen as a counterweight to the G7, which includes the US
*14:07.740- 14:13.660* :  Japan and Germany. I spoke to Fakundo Iglesias, a journalist in Argentina.
*14:14.020- 14:19.200* :  The new government's announcement that they are leaving should come as no surprise.
*14:19.580- 14:24.680* :  Millet had said that his government would pursue closer relations with the United States,
*14:24.680- 14:31.860* :  Israel and what he calls the free world. Then in November after Millet won the presidential runoff,
*14:31.960- 14:36.740* :  his foreign secretary announced that Argentina would not be joining the BRICS.
*14:37.040- 14:43.120* :  As for the specific reasons, they seem to be purely ideological. Not even far-right president
*14:43.120- 14:48.960* :  Javier Bolsonaro withdrew from the BRICS and Millet has been calling both China and Brazil to
*14:48.960- 14:55.000* :  of the most important countries in the BRICS communist countries. In today's letter, he just said
*14:55.140- 15:00.200* :  many aspects of the current foreign policy differ from those of the previous administration,
*15:00.200- 15:06.900* :  giving no further reason. But what media bandits both left wing and right wing have said is that
*15:06.900- 15:12.380* :  this has purely ideological motivations. Of course, he's only recently coming to office.
*15:12.380- 15:16.520* :  He has a very radical agenda. How will this help his agenda?
*15:17.060- 15:23.020* :  He hasn't considered in what he has promised. So showing him a pure ally of the United States
*15:23.020- 15:28.800* :  could, in his view, advance the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund,
*15:29.280- 15:32.360* :  will cease, of course, led by the United States.
*15:32.380- 15:37.120* :  People in Argentina have withstood financial issues for many, many years.
*15:37.520- 15:41.920* :  What has been the reaction of the people in Argentina to what's happened since he
*15:42.400- 15:43.160* :  became the president?
*15:43.500- 15:48.260* :  There is a sector that is protesting against mainly the austerity measures.
*15:48.700- 15:53.980* :  Inflation, of course, has been historically high here in Argentina. But this latest
*15:53.980- 16:00.920* :  devaluation has even pushed prices up from what they were before. Just to give you an example,
*16:00.920- 16:09.340* :  beef, which is something that Argentines love has gone up by 50 percent just since the beginning of
*16:09.340- 16:14.540* :  December. That has never happened like that high. I mean, we are used to inflation, but that's
*16:15.200- 16:20.440* :  high even for us. So there were protests that they are far from being massive protests.
*16:21.400- 16:25.980* :  People that from poor neighborhoods massively voted for me lay and I asked them,
*16:25.980- 16:31.980* :  these austerity measures will they be an impact on you? And they are ready for that, right?
*16:31.980- 16:36.960* :  They say, of course, these austerity measures will not be beneficial for me in the short term,
*16:36.960- 16:40.580* :  but I know that in the long term they will be. So I am ready.
*16:41.040- 16:43.020* :  For Kundo Eglésia in Argentina.
*16:46.360- 16:48.360* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast.
*16:49.160- 16:53.960* :  Well, we've got a really good understanding of a very small part of the moon and that's
*16:53.960- 16:59.080* :  the near side, the bit that we see all the time. So we don't know hardly anything at all about
*16:59.080- 17:04.740* :  the file side. We hear about what 2024 and beyond holds for space exploration.
*17:11.920- 17:17.900* :  The authorities in Ethiopia's Tigray region say it's on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe,
*17:18.640- 17:24.840* :  comparable to the famine in the 1980s, which prompted the live aid concert. Tigray's interim
*17:24.840- 17:31.160* :  administration, which was established following a two-year civil war, said a dark cloud of starvation
*17:31.160- 17:37.420* :  and death was hovering over the region. It said more than 90 percent of the population was at
*17:37.740- 17:40.900* :  risk. Our Africa regional editor is Richard Hamilton.
*17:41.220- 17:48.540* :  Really interesting historical comparison. That famine in 1983 to 1985 was created by a perfect
*17:48.540- 17:54.400* :  storm of adverse events. There was a recurring drought, failed harvest, a conflict that prevented
*17:54.420- 18:00.000* :  aid from getting in and government policies that relocated families and rooted relief to certain
*18:00.000- 18:06.320* :  areas. And there's this famous report in 1984 by the BBC's Michael Burke, who called it a
*18:06.320- 18:12.160* :  biblical famine now in the 20th century. I remember seeing that report and someone else who saw it
*18:12.160- 18:17.840* :  was the Irish singer Bob Geldoff, who of course created band-aid and the live aid concert and raised
*18:18.260- 18:25.060* :  millions for aid relief. And that concert was in July 1985. And now it looks as if we're seeing a
*18:25.060- 18:31.840* :  similar interplay of environmental factors and human cruelty. The Indian economist, Amartya
*18:31.840- 18:37.220* :  Sen said famines are not a natural disaster, but a result of social and political factors
*18:37.640- 18:42.780* :  were vulnerable groups, lose entitlement to food. So he was basically saying famines are not
*18:42.780- 18:49.060* :  acts of God, but acts of man. And it seems that this time we've had a two-year civil war in Tigray.
*18:49.060- 18:55.540* :  There was astonishing destruction by the Ethiopian federal government forces. They destroyed hospitals,
*18:55.540- 19:00.560* :  infrastructure. They brought Tigray to its knees. More than a million people were forcibly
*19:00.560- 19:06.840* :  displaced. Hundreds of thousands are killed. And they prevented aid getting in. This is a devastating
*19:07.020- 19:12.940* :  situation and we're seeing history repeat itself. But Ethiopia's federal authorities have denied
*19:12.940- 19:18.180* :  there's a famine. So why have they done that? They have said that it's a drought, that it's not yet
*19:18.180- 19:23.420* :  a famine. That may be a technical point. They may be right on that. They say they're helping people
*19:23.420- 19:28.420* :  the drought. But critics say they don't want the world to see what they have done. The war was
*19:28.420- 19:34.360* :  conducted in secrecy. The internet, the phones were cut off. They were accused. The federal
*19:34.360- 19:40.220* :  government of using starvation as a weapon of war. They stopped aid from getting in. And they don't
*19:40.220- 19:45.640* :  want to draw attention allegedly to these man-made factors. So the interim authority, which has
*19:45.640- 19:50.640* :  taken over the region, says the Ethiopian government have done their part to silence the guns.
*19:50.680- 19:55.080* :  Now they should do their part to address this looming humanitarian catastrophe.
*19:55.100- 20:01.720* :  Richard Hamilton. Police in India say they're trying to identify the suspected human traffickers
*20:02.340- 20:07.700* :  who were tempted to send more than 300 Indians illegally to the U.S. via Mexico.
*20:08.460- 20:13.960* :  The plane had been chartered to fly from Dubai to Nicaragua, but was halted in France last week
*20:13.960- 20:19.900* :  whilst refueling. Our South Asian correspondent Ambarassin Atarajan reports from Delhi.
*20:20.300- 20:25.500* :  French officials detained the plane and the passengers after receiving an anonymous tip-off.
*20:25.840- 20:31.160* :  After four days of investigation, the French authorities allowed most of the passengers to
*20:31.160- 20:37.480* :  return to India while two dozen of them sought asylum in France. Indian police said the migrants
*20:37.480- 20:44.360* :  had been promised a safe passage to the U.S. and had paid up to $150,000 per person.
*20:44.940- 20:51.020* :  Nicaragua is seen as one of the staging points for illegal migrants to enter the U.S. through Mexico.
*20:51.900- 20:57.180* :  Most of the passengers were from the states of Gujarat and Punjab. Data from the U.S.
*20:57.180- 21:02.780* :  customs and border protection last month showed that an unprecedented number of Indian immigrants
*21:02.780- 21:07.860* :  were crossing into the United States on foot through its southern and northern borders.
*21:08.420- 21:15.880* :  Figures showed nearly 97,000 Indians were apprehended, expelled or denied entry after having entered
*21:15.880- 21:23.840* :  the U.S. without papers since October 2022. Ambarassin Atarajan. This year saw some big developments
*21:23.840- 21:30.040* :  in space exploration. Elon Musk's much-anticipated starship spacecraft launch,
*21:30.760- 21:36.320* :  containing the most powerful rocket ever built, exploded not once, but twice in trying.
*21:37.100- 21:43.240* :  But his company SpaceX remains undeterred in their mission to champion a fully reusable
*21:43.240- 21:50.120* :  transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet. In complete contrast,
*21:50.760- 21:57.100* :  India made history when Chandrayam 3 became the first mission to touch down at the Luna South Pole.
*21:57.880- 22:03.380* :  So, what discoveries in space exploration can we look forward to in 2024?
*22:04.200- 22:09.980* :  Levin Arthur spoke to Monica Grady, Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences at the Open
*22:09.980- 22:15.520* :  University here in England. Next year there's going to be two sets of exciting targets. One is
*22:15.660- 22:21.980* :  our moon, which is going to be targeted by NASA and the European Space Agency and the Chinese
*22:21.980- 22:29.340* :  Space Agency. And then also Mars' moon Phobos is going to be explored by the Japanese Space Agency.
*22:29.480- 22:33.600* :  So, starting with our moon, what do we still need to find out about the moon? What's the
*22:33.600- 22:39.040* :  kind of specific aim of these missions? So there's a big international program called Artemis,
*22:39.120- 22:44.580* :  a series of short missions which are setting up the technology to eventually land astronauts
*22:44.580- 22:50.680* :  back on the moon. There's a mission which is going towards the end of 2024 and this will just
*22:50.680- 22:56.000* :  all bit the moon. And then sometime in 2025 astronauts will return to the moon, which will be
*22:56.000- 23:03.020* :  really exciting. Part of the reason for these missions is to see if a human habitation could be
*23:03.260- 23:07.680* :  set up on the moon, not people living there forever, but maybe visiting for vacations,
*23:07.680- 23:11.340* :  visiting just to explore more about the moon for scientists and engineers.
*23:11.820- 23:18.420* :  How advanced is our understanding so far off whether the moon is habitable? We've got a really
*23:18.420- 23:24.860* :  good understanding of a very small part of the moon, less than 5% of the lunar surface. And that's
*23:24.860- 23:29.980* :  the near side, the bit that we see all the time. So we don't know hardly anything at all about
*23:29.980- 23:35.660* :  the far side. We've got lots of hypotheses but we don't know for absolute. We've got a good idea
*23:35.660- 23:41.540* :  that there could be water there, water ice and hydrogen. It water you would split into hydrogen
*23:41.540- 23:46.840* :  and oxygen to make oxygen for breathing. But there's all sorts of interesting experiments about
*23:47.200- 23:53.540* :  can you use the lunar soil to make bricks? It's all terribly science fiction, you know. You mentioned
*23:53.540- 23:59.540* :  Mars's moons as well. What is exciting about Mars's moon? What does that offer? Well Mars has got two
*23:59.540- 24:04.240* :  moons. One's called Phobos and one's called Demos and we don't really know where they come from.
*24:04.440- 24:10.460* :  There's been no specific spacecraft gone into orbit around Phobos and we don't know what it's made
*24:10.460- 24:16.900* :  from. We got no idea. And the really, really exciting thing for me is bringing some material back,
*24:16.940- 24:22.220* :  which is what the Japanese are going to do this year. NASA brought material back from Bennu,
*24:22.360- 24:27.600* :  which is a major highlight for me, having some of this asteroid in the lab to burn.
*24:28.120- 24:35.500* :  This is what I'm really hoping in 2029 when the Marsha Moon exploration spacecraft brings back
*24:35.500- 24:40.360* :  some material. I hope I'm still composting this enough to analyse it. So I mean there's all
*24:40.360- 24:45.260* :  sorts of exciting possibilities because Mars was formed around about the same times the Earth a
*24:45.260- 24:51.580* :  bit after. And its surface has been recycled because it's had water going on the surface,
*24:51.580- 24:56.560* :  volcanoes, just like the Earth. It's hoped that there might be material from the earliest
*24:56.560- 25:02.900* :  path of Marsha and history just left as debris on the surface of Phobos and it's the same with
*25:03.100- 25:09.060* :  our moon as well. I'm interested to know about different countries' missions into space and who
*25:09.060- 25:15.040* :  is leading what. There is a global exploration programme, which all the space agencies, including
*25:15.040- 25:22.720* :  Russia and China, have signed up to. No one country really drives the agenda because the
*25:22.720- 25:27.240* :  questions we're all asking are the same. How did the Earth form? How did the Universe form?
*25:27.240- 25:33.000* :  How did life form? What's the lifetime of a star? These are multinational cross-disciplinary
*25:33.000- 25:37.960* :  questions that all scientists in this field want to know the answer for. Space is the place where
*25:37.960- 25:44.480* :  peace breaks out all over and you rely on each other. Lele Nafu speaking to Monica Grady,
*25:44.920- 25:51.520* :  Professor of Planetary and Space Sciences at the Open University. The Austrian government has
*25:51.520- 25:57.320* :  created a scheme that's designed to encourage people to get things fixed rather than throw them
*25:57.320- 26:03.920* :  away. They are providing a voucher worth up to 200 euros to get an electrical device repaired.
*26:04.760- 26:09.100* :  Our correspondent Bethany Bell in Vienna has been finding out how it's working.
*26:10.720- 26:16.600* :  Eric's laptop is broken, so he's come to the helfer line workshop. Because of Austria's repair
*26:16.600- 26:24.000* :  voucher scheme, he'll only have to pay 50% of the costs to get it fixed. At the moment it's a
*26:24.240- 26:33.060* :  laptop and I try to make it go again instead of firing a new one. And this way things can be saved.
*26:33.860- 26:40.680* :  Exactly. Helferline CEO Kameh Schmidt-Glubber says the repair bonus scheme has been great for his
*26:40.680- 26:47.200* :  business. Our revenues have doubled since it was introduced, so we are very happy about it.
*26:47.720- 26:53.540* :  I think the repertoire bonus is a really win-win situation for customers, for local businesses,
*26:54.200- 27:00.000* :  and of course with the environment. There's less electronic waste. So tell me how it works. I have a
*27:00.000- 27:06.620* :  broken computer. What happens? You come to our repair shop. Either you already downloaded the
*27:06.620- 27:14.500* :  repertoire bonus on a public website or we help you do that. Then you hand over your device. We
*27:14.500- 27:21.580* :  repair it. And in the end you pay the amount of the invoice and you get back half of the costs
*27:21.820- 27:28.500* :  after three to four weeks. The government's repair voucher system is just for electrical appliances.
*27:29.020- 27:34.940* :  But the city of Vienna runs a separate scheme, which helps people pay for repairs to old clothes,
*27:34.940- 27:41.260* :  bicycles or furniture. Marker's Peeringer, the coordinator of the repair network in Vienna,
*27:41.820- 27:48.660* :  says it's all about changing policies and mindsets. The financial aspect of repair is a very
*27:48.660- 27:54.060* :  important part. The products have to be repairable. So we work on this on the level of the European
*27:54.060- 28:02.440* :  Union. For many people it's still very positive to have always the newest product and to throw away
*28:02.440- 28:09.600* :  your clothing after half a year or even less. We need awareness raising. And actually we see now
*28:09.600- 28:17.180* :  in Austria we have a problem that we don't have enough repairs. So we need a system which is
*28:17.180- 28:21.660* :  promoting repair as a job. We are working on this at the moment.
*28:22.300- 28:25.840* :  Marcus Pierre Ringer, Ending Matt Report by Bethany Bell.
*28:27.020- 28:33.140* :  Many people say 2023 has been the year artificial intelligence really took off.
*28:33.740- 28:41.220* :  AI is now everywhere in industries, education and even the arts and entertainment. Musicians,
*28:41.220- 28:47.540* :  actors and politicians have all had their voices cloned by AI. We're the without their consent
*28:47.580- 28:53.160* :  and sometimes even when they're dead. And that's led to big questions about copyright,
*28:53.180- 29:00.580* :  cybersecurity and fraud. Julia Marshall is the longest serving news hour presenter on the BBC
*29:00.580- 29:08.220* :  World Service. Could AI possibly pretend to be him? Professor Oliver Buckley from the University
*29:08.220- 29:15.440* :  of East Anglia has generated a fake Julian which he presented to the real Julian. And this is
*29:15.440- 29:20.220* :  what happened. You need access to someone's voice as you are a presenter. There are lots of
*29:20.220- 29:24.940* :  your voice in the public domain. So we take around five minutes of audio, upload it to a cloud
*29:24.940- 29:29.420* :  service and it creates a model which is a template for the way that you speak. And then you type
*29:29.420- 29:33.800* :  something in a box and that's the way you go. It's text to speech and it will spit out in your voice.
*29:34.600- 29:40.940* :  Okay, let's cut to the quick. I've never actually heard this before. Hello, AI Julian, can you hear me?
*29:41.140- 29:47.160* :  Hello, real Julian. I'm AI Julian. How are you today? I'm here to steal your job. Do you have any
*29:47.160- 29:55.160* :  tips that could help me improve my presenting skills? That's pretty good. My immediate reaction is
*29:55.160- 30:02.180* :  the sound is a lot thinner. You've certainly got all the cadences. Let's try again. You have a
*30:02.180- 30:08.440* :  news hour script. Let's hear it. Hello and welcome to news hour from the BBC World Service.
*30:08.440- 30:15.020* :  Coming to you live from London, I'm Julian Marshall. Today in Gaza, more intense fighting with
*30:15.020- 30:20.800* :  street battles in the south and more bombing in Gaza City in the north. And is Nikki Haley
*30:20.800- 30:26.620* :  gathering enough support among Republicans to beat Donald Trump in the primaries? You've given me
*30:26.620- 30:30.900* :  a little bit of an accent. Yeah, that does happen actually sometimes. So the way that these things work,
*30:30.900- 30:35.000* :  your sample of data that we've uploaded of your voice, but also stuff that it knows about voices
*30:35.000- 30:40.060* :  and how we talk and cadence and pronunciation. So it tends to veer a little bit towards American
*30:40.060- 30:43.920* :  sometimes or an American interpretation of British, which tends to be a little Australian,
*30:44.380- 30:48.600* :  but it does quite a nice approximation with very little effort or input, I think.
*30:48.940- 30:56.340* :  What about the ways in which this technology could be abused? This is a scam call in my voice.
*30:56.840- 31:02.620* :  Hi, it's Julian here. I'm having some problems with online banking. Can you quickly send 100
*31:02.620- 31:07.160* :  pounds to the plumber, please? I'll send you his bank details. Yeah, a pretty convincing
*31:07.160- 31:14.040* :  approximation. In an emergency, I can imagine somebody doing what I've requested them to do. And
*31:14.040- 31:18.980* :  presumably, the technology is becoming more and more convincing. Yes, so if you look online,
*31:18.980- 31:23.080* :  there are scores of web-based platforms that you can upload audio to and it will create a
*31:23.080- 31:27.480* :  clone of your voice or the voice that you give it. The one I used to create your voice is around five
*31:27.480- 31:31.860* :  pounds a month. There's professional level stuff for the website. So it's aimed at replacing
*31:31.860- 31:35.480* :  voice actors and getting people to do re-recordings of lines and things like that.
*31:35.700- 31:41.300* :  How do you protect yourself against this? How do governments protect their citizens against this?
*31:41.500- 31:46.260* :  The problem is the technology has exploded so rapidly. So if we think about chat GPT,
*31:46.760- 31:51.540* :  it was a nice novelty and a toy to play with at the start of the year and now it produces very
*31:51.540- 31:56.080* :  realistic writing and anything that you ask it to really. Things have moved that quickly in the
*31:56.080- 32:00.000* :  last 12 months. It's very hard for legislation to necessarily keep up with that. So that's a real
*32:00.000- 32:04.660* :  problem. The key thing that people can do is to be objective and be critical. So if you receive
*32:04.660- 32:09.440* :  a call from someone that seems out of the blue and unusual, then even if it's alarming and stressful,
*32:09.860- 32:13.520* :  it's important to step back and think that if that would actually happen and think about what they're
*32:13.960- 32:21.280* :  saying. And this is just voice replication. If AI were to try to steal my job, it would have to be
*32:21.280- 32:28.120* :  programmed in order to be able to generate an introduction. Yes, I think for now the AI is only
*32:28.120- 32:32.520* :  as good as the prompts that we give it. So you could use chat GPT or Bard or one of the other
*32:32.520- 32:38.140* :  generative writing tools and you could feed it a sample of your articles and introductions and say
*32:38.140- 32:42.240* :  write me another one in the style of this and then feed it into the voice software and you could
*32:42.400- 32:46.820* :  have quite a nice pipeline of content. But it's going to miss that creativity of what we're good at.
*32:47.940- 32:53.260* :  Thank goodness for that. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Professor. And perhaps time to say goodbye to
*32:53.260- 32:59.160* :  AI Julian. Goodbye, AI Julian. Goodbye, real Julian. Have a happy new year. I'm sure we will talk
*32:59.160- 33:06.120* :  again soon. Julian Marshall in conversation with his voice, doppelganger, AI Julian. And I think
*33:06.120- 33:13.860* :  you know which one I prefer. And that's all from the real me for now, but there will be a new
*33:13.860- 33:19.580* :  addition of the global news podcast later. And as we head towards the new year, we want to hear
*33:19.580- 33:25.480* :  about stories which are important to you that we can maybe feature on the podcast in 2024.
*33:25.580- 33:31.100* :  If you have something you think others will be interested in and the BBC could possibly report on
*33:31.100- 33:38.560* :  then send us an email with the details. The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk and you can
