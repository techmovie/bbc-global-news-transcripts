*01:23.360- 01:26.560* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Wednesday
*01:26.560- 01:33.220* :  the 13th of December. The UN votes for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as President Biden criticizes
*01:33.220- 01:38.720* :  Israel's military operation there. So will it make any difference? The Ukrainian President
*01:38.720- 01:42.900* :  gets a warm reception at the White House but struggles to win over Republicans.
*01:43.760- 01:47.900* :  And delegates at the UN Climate Summit in Dubai are still trying to reach a deal on
*01:47.900- 01:54.480* :  curbing fossil fuels. Now the expectation is much higher, which is we want phase out of fossil
*01:54.480- 01:59.060* :  fuels to be in the main text, but it always comes down to all night negotiations.
*02:02.220- 02:06.520* :  Also in the podcast. I don't want to put a hierarchy between pets and children,
*02:06.660- 02:10.540* :  but I wouldn't be surprised if someone said like, I can't afford to have a kid,
*02:10.540- 02:15.280* :  so I am choosing pets. With one of the world's lowest birthrates
*02:15.280- 02:18.140* :  are animals replacing children in Taiwan.
*02:23.720- 02:27.200* :  Nearly seven weeks since it began its ground invasion of Gaza,
*02:27.200- 02:31.280* :  Israel shows no sign of completing its mission to defeat Hamas.
*02:31.280- 02:36.940* :  The Hamas Run Health Ministry there says 50,000 people have been wounded on top of the
*02:36.940- 02:45.280* :  18,000 killed. For its part, Israel said on Tuesday that 19 of the 135 hostages still being
*02:45.280- 02:51.500* :  held in Gaza are dead and it had recovered two bodies. The UN General Assembly, meanwhile,
*02:51.500- 02:56.480* :  has once again called for the fighting to stop, overwhelmingly passing a resolution demanding
*02:56.480- 03:05.660* :  an immediate ceasefire. The result of the vote is as follows. 153 in favour, 10 against,
*03:06.700- 03:16.020* :  23 abstentions, draft resolution A stroke E S 10 stroke L 27 has been adopted.
*03:19.640- 03:24.520* :  With the United States voted against the non-binding resolution, but a few hours earlier,
*03:24.520- 03:30.000* :  President Biden made his strongest criticism yet of what he called Israel's indiscriminate
*03:30.000- 03:34.940* :  bombing of Gaza, saying the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needed to change
*03:34.940- 03:40.620* :  or risk losing global support, as I heard from our correspondent Barbara Plattasha in Washington.
*03:40.880- 03:45.240* :  He was speaking to a group of supporters at a campaign fundraiser and the remarks are
*03:45.240- 03:49.260* :  based on pool notes. We don't have the full transcript yet, so all of that being said,
*03:49.260- 03:55.060* :  I think it's his most frank acknowledgement of the impact of Israel's military campaign,
*03:55.060- 03:59.320* :  the phrase indiscriminate bombing is certainly stronger than anything we've heard from him.
*03:59.320- 04:05.780* :  Also, the acknowledgement that Israel is losing international support, which we can see with
*04:05.780- 04:12.520* :  those votes at the UN constantly trying to get a humanitarian ceasefire. But he'd in no way indicated
*04:12.520- 04:19.200* :  that Israel was losing U.S. support for its military campaign. He did express differences
*04:19.200- 04:24.980* :  with Israel, but that was over plans for Gaza's future. He said that Israel had the most
*04:24.980- 04:30.880* :  conservative government in its history, that it did not support a two-state solution with the
*04:30.880- 04:35.400* :  Palestinians, something that Mr. Biden's top officials have been promoting as the postwar path,
*04:35.460- 04:41.300* :  and that Mr. Netanyahu needed to change the government in order to find a long-term solution
*04:41.360- 04:46.020* :  to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So that's really where he was the strongest in terms of
*04:46.020- 04:50.480* :  eradicating disagreements. And Mr. Netanyahu has commented also he acknowledged the disagreement
*04:50.480- 04:56.040* :  on Gaza's future, but he said Israel has U.S. support for its goal of destroying Hamas.
*04:56.540- 05:01.280* :  Sure, we have recently had more calls for restraint from the likes of the Secretary of State
*05:01.280- 05:07.100* :  Anthony Blinken, but at the same time, if the U.S. doesn't apply pressure by ending, say,
*05:07.100- 05:10.900* :  diplomatic or military support, there don't seem to be any changes from the Israeli. So is there
*05:10.900- 05:15.820* :  all hot air? I wouldn't call it hot air. No, I think that the officials who are making those
*05:15.820- 05:19.480* :  statements, and we're talking about Anthony Blinken, the Secretary of State, who talked about a
*05:19.480- 05:25.080* :  gap between intentions and reality when, speaking about pledges by Israeli authorities to spare
*05:25.080- 05:31.040* :  civilians, you're talking about the Secretary of Defense, who have basically said if Israel continues
*05:31.040- 05:35.740* :  killing so many people, it could be a strategic defeat because it will push Palestinians into the
*05:35.740- 05:39.960* :  arms of Hamas. Those are real concerns. We are hearing them at the State Department. There is
*05:39.960- 05:45.320* :  concern about the impact of the high death toll and the destruction of civilian infrastructure,
*05:45.320- 05:53.560* :  but the U.S. policy-wise is supporting Israel's goal to destroy or to severely cripple Hamas.
*05:53.560- 05:58.640* :  It's in line with the goal, and as such, it has called on Israel to protect civilians,
*05:58.760- 06:05.340* :  but it has not pushed things publicly when civilians do not seem to be protected in the way
*06:05.340- 06:10.400* :  that it's calling for, and it continues to withhold support from a ceasefire, a humanitarian
*06:10.400- 06:15.260* :  ceasefire, which is something that much of the world is calling for. Barbara Platt, Usher in
*06:15.260- 06:20.820* :  Washington. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials say at least six people have been killed in the city
*06:20.820- 06:27.300* :  of Janine in the occupied West Bank during a military operation by Israel. The Israeli army said
*06:27.300- 06:32.920* :  it had launched what it called a counterterrorism operation there. Tensions have been rising in the
*06:32.920- 06:37.820* :  West Bank because of the war in Gaza. Our Middle East correspondent Lucy Williamson sent this
*06:37.820- 06:45.760* :  report from inside Janine. Since the war in Gaza began, Israel's military operations in the
*06:45.760- 06:52.120* :  occupied West Bank have become more frequent and more forceful. From the early hours of this
*06:52.120- 06:58.020* :  morning, explosions and gunfire have echoed around Janine from the camp to the city centre,
*06:58.540- 07:03.800* :  to the hillsides around. Armoured vehicles have been moving around the city's main hospital
*07:03.800- 07:10.340* :  near the entrance to the camp. Inside the hospital are the bodies of three of the men killed inside
*07:10.340- 07:17.440* :  the city today, in a drone strike, witnesses say. We're just walking up towards the hospital here
*07:17.540- 07:22.480* :  where the Israeli army have positioned some of their bulldozers, just the drone overhead.
*07:23.620- 07:30.800* :  You can smell the tear gas. Inside, I find the hospital director, Dr. Wissam Bakar.
*07:31.080- 07:37.460* :  The Israeli encouraging that started about 4 a.m. three young men came to our department.
*07:37.460- 07:43.860* :  They are mostly civilian people. It's the second time in two weeks I've met Dr. Bakar here
*07:43.860- 07:49.940* :  to talk about people killed during Israeli operations. The persistence of invasion and
*07:49.940- 07:55.860* :  encouraging to Janine and killing the young people. This will make the people inside Janine more
*07:55.860- 08:01.760* :  angry. This will not bring the peace. Israel's defence minister said that hundreds of terrorists
*08:01.760- 08:07.260* :  had been killed in the West Bank in the past year, more than half of them since the Hamas attacks.
*08:07.960- 08:13.220* :  A youth leader for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatta, told me that support for Hamas among young
*08:13.220- 08:20.640* :  people was now at an all-time high. Fresh idols for a new generation, he said, after decades of
*08:20.640- 08:26.820* :  tightening occupation and fading political hope. You see Williamson in Janine in the West Bank.
*08:27.740- 08:32.420* :  The Ukrainian president, Vladimir Zelensky, has been at the White House in Washington meeting
*08:32.420- 08:38.380* :  the man who is in effect his main weapon supplier. US President Joe Biden is keen to continue
*08:38.380- 08:43.920* :  helping Ukraine fight against the Russian invaders. But Republicans in the US Congress are blocking
*08:43.920- 08:50.380* :  Mr. Biden's latest request for $60 billion on top of more than $100 billion already allocated.
*08:51.320- 08:55.940* :  Republican Senator Eric Schmidt, who met President Zelensky earlier, said American voters would
*08:55.940- 09:00.980* :  prefer the money to be spent on securing the US border with Mexico. After the meeting,
*09:00.980- 09:06.440* :  President Biden said he'd told Congress to approve funding for Ukraine before the Christmas break.
*09:06.720- 09:10.620* :  This winter Putin plans, once again, to bombard Ukraine's electric grid,
*09:10.840- 09:13.900* :  plenty of families in the darkness, and the coldest part of the year,
*09:14.320- 09:17.500* :  and doing great damage. We can't and won't let him succeed.
*09:17.940- 09:22.820* :  Mr. President, I'd call on Congress to do the right thing, to stand with Ukraine and to stand
*09:22.820- 09:28.920* :  up for freedom. Of his part, Mr. Zelensky was keen to underline Ukraine's military gains on the
*09:28.920- 09:35.040* :  battlefield. She's 100,000. Are you traveling to Ukraine's house, and others are on the battlefield?
*09:35.760- 09:40.980* :  They prove ever they did. Ukraine can win. We are moving to the right direction, and I want to
*09:40.980- 09:46.780* :  discuss with the President how to strengthen it, especially in enhancing our air defense and
*09:46.780- 09:53.200* :  ability to destroy Russia's logistics. Our goals for 24 are clear. Take away Russia's
*09:53.420- 09:56.600* :  superiority, and disrupt their offensive.
*09:57.060- 10:01.680* :  Well, our North America correspondent, Nomiya Igbo, told me more about the latest events in
*10:02.700- 10:05.820* :  Washington. President Zelensky is on very comfortable territory right now.
*10:06.120- 10:10.820* :  Both men have stood shoulder to shoulder, saying that this aid is incredibly important for Ukraine,
*10:10.820- 10:16.900* :  this package is needed in order to beat Vladimir Putin. Earlier today, it was much more difficult
*10:16.900- 10:22.060* :  for President Zelensky, because he was in Congress, we were on the hill. Whilst he met all 100
*10:22.060- 10:26.420* :  senators, including, of course, the Republicans, to try and convince them is them, he needs to get
*10:26.420- 10:31.200* :  on board. After that meeting, spoke to a few of those Republicans, senators, including Lindsey
*10:31.200- 10:35.220* :  Graham, including Eric Schmidt, who you mentioned just a moment ago, and they also look in theory,
*10:35.220- 10:42.080* :  we definitely support President Zelensky in his battle against Russia, but we want to prioritize
*10:42.880- 10:47.580* :  U.S. border security, and they said that there's nothing that Zelensky has said to them so far
*10:47.580- 10:51.800* :  that changes their minds. They're still not convinced the military strategy is a successful one,
*10:52.420- 10:58.460* :  and they will not budge on what they're asking the Democrats in terms of security changes
*10:58.780- 11:03.280* :  on the border. So this foreign policy issue has become a big domestic issue, and there's just no
*11:03.280- 11:08.300* :  changes so far as the Republicans are concerned. Yeah, given that, is there any suggestion that
*11:08.300- 11:13.900* :  President Biden might perhaps give a little and exceed to their demands for more border security
*11:13.900- 11:17.680* :  in return for getting some money for Ukraine? Well, right now in this conference, he's saying,
*11:17.680- 11:22.600* :  look, we do care about what's happening on the border, and the statistics are there to show that
*11:22.900- 11:26.660* :  it's not an issue that can be ignored earlier in this year. There was a daily average of 8,000
*11:26.660- 11:32.280* :  legal crossings across the border, and even members of Biden's own party have said that there
*11:32.280- 11:37.260* :  needs to be some sort of change. What the new plans are, that's what they disagree on, Democrats say
*11:37.260- 11:42.440* :  what Republicans are suggesting, a lot of their changes are unworkable, go against law, they're in
*11:42.440- 11:47.280* :  humane, they're cruel. So what they're exactly going to compromise on, we just don't know.
*11:47.280- 11:52.180* :  President Biden is saying that he's hopeful that this big package will pass before Christmas,
*11:52.180- 11:57.160* :  Mitch McConnell, very powerful Republicans, Senate Minority Leader, is saying the only way that
*11:57.160- 12:03.560* :  this can pass is if Democrats agree to Republican demands, which they're just not going to,
*12:04.020- 12:09.520* :  so it's really hard to see right now what the timeline is for any of this and what happens next.
*12:09.520- 12:16.420* :  Nomiya Ikbal in Washington. The UN Climate Summit was supposed to have wrapped up on Tuesday,
*12:16.420- 12:21.620* :  but negotiations continued into the night, in Dubai as the nearly 200 nations
*12:21.620- 12:27.580* :  wrangled over the final agreement of COP28. The previous draft deal sparked
*12:27.580- 12:33.300* :  uproar when it excluded any mention of phasing out fossil fuels, something widely seen as vital
*12:33.300- 12:38.940* :  to reducing global warming. Mark Mazlin, a British professor of climatology, says many countries
*12:38.940- 12:43.280* :  do want an agreement that's tougher than ever before. The expectation is much higher,
*12:43.280- 12:49.240* :  which is we want phased out of fossil fuels to be in the main text. We have had a huge
*12:49.240- 12:55.000* :  sort of like excitement because the United Arab Emirates, the President have actually really
*12:55.000- 12:59.240* :  built this up that they were going to have this in the text, but it always comes down to this,
*12:59.440- 13:05.960* :  to all night negotiation. Well delegates in the UAE have been negotiating over an updated text,
*13:06.460- 13:10.440* :  with the U.S. envoy John Kerry saying it's likely to include tougher language on
*13:10.440- 13:15.720* :  getting rid of fossil fuels. So are they making any headway? I asked our environment correspondent
*13:15.720- 13:20.580* :  Matt McGraw, who is in Dubai. Yes, I think there are some signs of progress. I think the fact that
*13:20.580- 13:25.680* :  the presidency is going around as we speak, meeting some of the country groups explaining the
*13:25.680- 13:32.220* :  changes in the text is made in the last day or so. I think it's hopeful that he is explaining
*13:32.220- 13:36.540* :  to those country groups that their concerns have been met and he's trying to take on board and
*13:36.580- 13:42.420* :  make a more progressive stab at an agreement than was the case yesterday. So had a positive nod
*13:42.420- 13:48.080* :  from John Kerry that things are somewhat stronger, but it's not a done deal as yet by a long way.
*13:48.300- 13:53.960* :  Now we heard that half of the countries involved wanted stronger language. What is the sticking point
*13:53.960- 14:00.100* :  among those who don't want to hear this phrase phased out fossil fuels? It's quite complicated
*14:00.100- 14:04.460* :  in some ways and quite simple in others. We tend in the media I think to kind of paint the
*14:05.080- 14:09.020* :  cop into good guys and bad guys or countries who want to make progress quicker in other countries
*14:09.020- 14:13.700* :  who don't and on the question of fossil fuels it's the petro states who are seen as the ones who are
*14:13.700- 14:18.460* :  not keen on going quickly and that is certainly true. But there's another big bunch of countries
*14:18.460- 14:23.000* :  in the middle, emerging economies from all over Africa and Asia and South America, who are
*14:23.000- 14:28.260* :  uncertain about phasing out fossil fuels because they need money and they see oil and gas as a
*14:28.540- 14:33.420* :  major opportunity for them to make money to fund their transition to green energy and they're
*14:33.680- 14:38.340* :  very cautious about giving that off when there's no money on the table in venues like this.
*14:38.600- 14:44.640* :  And they need unanimity to get agreement. What might a so-called landing zone to use that
*14:44.640- 14:49.860* :  hobble phrase look like in terms of this deal? Hard to say how it will be anything other than a
*14:49.860- 14:54.040* :  compromise I hear from various people who have been familiar with some parts of the text that
*14:54.040- 14:59.020* :  it's looking that way like some form of fudge if you like. That's normally the procedure here
*14:59.020- 15:03.260* :  you have 200 countries and getting agreement tends to fall towards the lowest common denominator.
*15:03.780- 15:08.140* :  The big concerns for a lot of countries was that the science this year showed the warmest year
*15:08.140- 15:13.660* :  in 125,000 years and it was a great opportunity to make the link to fossil fuels at a meeting like
*15:13.660- 15:18.540* :  this and get progress on that issue and I think many people will feel it might be a missed opportunity
*15:18.540- 15:23.900* :  but we might be judging too soon. There's still some time to run in this meeting and we haven't
*15:23.900- 15:29.800* :  seen the text as yet. Matt McGraw in Dubai. Taiwan's birth rate is among the lowest in the world.
*15:29.800- 15:34.020* :  The latest figures show that on average fewer than one baby is born for every woman.
*15:34.660- 15:39.180* :  Many commentators blame economic factors for the trend but as Ed Butler reports from a cat
*15:39.180- 15:47.880* :  refuge in Taipei, pet seem to be filling the gap. Okay so I've just stepped into the quarantine
*15:47.880- 15:53.660* :  section now. We're looking at a few of them gazing out from their little pens. These are
*15:53.660- 16:01.800* :  trays you just collected. Some were brought in by people who just saw them on the street
*16:02.400- 16:09.380* :  and some of them they were adopted. We have more and more requests of owners who have to give
*16:09.380- 16:17.380* :  away their cat. Who's this one? He's very open when it comes to talking. Right here. So you've got
*16:17.380- 16:23.780* :  more cats than you used to have. Are more people coming in and adopting them? Oh Jura Yohui.
*16:23.980- 16:29.200* :  For sure a lot of more people are coming in to adopt especially when they're young couples.
*16:29.200- 16:35.100* :  So they're young couples like people in their 20s? Not sure since, still then. Yes and students.
*16:35.780- 16:41.660* :  Interesting. So these are their new babies. What Jura hadn't? I think it is a lot like babies.
*16:42.200- 16:49.680* :  Baby cats and baby dogs. Pet ownership it seems is skyrocketing in Taiwan at the moment with
*16:49.680- 16:56.660* :  furry friends now outnumbering the babies themselves. The writer and comedian Vicki Wang is one of the
*16:56.660- 17:04.540* :  new generation of Taiwanese pet enthusiasts. I am an owner of four cats because it makes more sense
*17:04.540- 17:10.840* :  than a city. You come home and there's someone there for you. It's comforting. I mean I've seen
*17:10.860- 17:16.960* :  a lot of buggies. Well, throwlers as you say in the States and they are quite often not
*17:16.960- 17:22.960* :  containing babies but dogs. I think that's a uniquely Taiwanese thing because you're required
*17:22.960- 17:29.300* :  to have them in a container to take them on the subway. It's like a wheelie suitcase. Taiwan
*17:29.740- 17:38.400* :  I've read has one of the lowest birth rates anywhere. A pet's replacing babies. I myself, I'm 37
*17:38.400- 17:43.520* :  years old this year. It doesn't really make sense for me to have kids anymore. It's a financial
*17:43.560- 17:52.100* :  decision. It's like nearly impossible at the current Taiwanese salary to start a family in your 20th.
*17:52.480- 17:58.940* :  I am pushing 40 now. I can't even consider it like buying properties somewhere in Taipei hopefully
*17:58.940- 18:05.500* :  in a decent school district. That's completely out of the question if I stay here and earn a Taiwanese
*18:05.500- 18:11.280* :  salary. I don't want to put a hierarchy between pets and children but I wouldn't be surprised
*18:11.280- 18:19.060* :  if someone said like I can't afford to have a kid so I am choosing pets. Taiwanese comedian
*18:19.060- 18:27.540* :  Fiki Wang ending that report by Ed Butler. Still come on the global news podcast. If they're sent
*18:27.540- 18:32.080* :  back to Afghanistan the Taliban will feel that they have been handed back some of their most
*18:32.440- 18:36.360* :  fierce opponents and the track record is they're either jailed or killed.
*18:36.820- 18:42.940* :  The 200 special forces trained by the UK living in fear of being sent back to Taliban controlled
*18:51.220- 18:55.880* :  Afghanistan. Despite negotiations at the COP28 summit reaching a crescendo on Tuesday,
*18:56.460- 19:02.200* :  the UK climate minister was called back to London on an 11,000 kilometre round trip
*19:02.680- 19:07.860* :  in order to vote for a bill seen as vital for his boss, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
*19:08.500- 19:13.020* :  In the end the controversial legislation on sending asylum seekers to Rwanda passed by a
*19:13.020- 19:22.340* :  reasonably healthy majority of 44. Order the eyes to the right, 313, the nose to the left,
*19:22.340- 19:30.500* :  269, so the eyes have it, the eyes have it unlocked. But divisions within Britain's governing
*19:30.500- 19:36.320* :  conservative party are likely to reappear as the bill proceeds to the next stage of the legislative
*19:36.320- 19:41.960* :  process. Watching events as they unfolded was our political correspondent Rob Watson in Westminster.
*19:42.420- 19:47.920* :  It's just going to be a crisis delayed rather than defused because the right wing of the party
*19:47.920- 19:52.540* :  have said, look, in the new year they're really going to want to make it even more draconian
*19:52.540- 19:57.360* :  than many lawyers already think that it is. And of course those in the sense of the governing
*19:57.360- 20:01.880* :  conservative party have said, hang on a minute, if it gets any more hard line than this,
*20:01.880- 20:06.320* :  we won't be able to support it. Yeah, yesterday we were talking about how it was all reminiscent
*20:06.320- 20:11.500* :  of the Brexit negotiations and in fact we saw one of these groups come out today and make
*20:11.500- 20:16.060* :  pronouncements just as they did back in what 2018? Absolutely, they said they were not going to be
*20:16.060- 20:20.880* :  supporting the government quite extraordinary if you think about it and that they will not support
*20:20.880- 20:26.860* :  it next year unless Mr Sunak agrees to make changes to it and absolutely an echo of Brexit
*20:26.860- 20:31.480* :  because those on the populist right of the governing conservative party, the same people who
*20:31.480- 20:36.840* :  are behind Brexit for them, sovereignty is absolutely supreme. They think that Britain should be able
*20:36.840- 20:42.040* :  to take back control of its borders as they say and that the views of international courts or
*20:42.060- 20:46.240* :  any sort of perception that sort of Britain is getting hard line, they're simply not bothered
*20:46.240- 20:50.660* :  about that. Whereas those more on the centre of the party, although they now accept Brexit,
*20:50.660- 20:56.120* :  they are hugely worried about the way all of this looks to the outside world about Britain's
*20:56.120- 21:01.740* :  reputation as a sort of country that upholds international law, upholds domestic law and which
*21:01.740- 21:07.720* :  allows people, including asylum seekers, to access the protection of the court division as
*21:07.720- 21:12.600* :  just crippling the conservative party in the way in which discipline is broken down or is
*21:12.600- 21:18.820* :  breaking down after 13 years in power. They have made it very clear the centrist that this bill
*21:18.820- 21:23.540* :  is just about as much as they can stomach because to briefly state what it does, it tries to restrict
*21:23.540- 21:29.980* :  the ability of asylum seekers to seek the protection of British courts to get a hearing in court
*21:29.980- 21:34.940* :  and for those on the centre of the Conservative party. This is the kind of thing that happens in
*21:34.940- 21:40.200* :  other countries, not countries like Britain. Our political correspondent Rob Watson in Westminster.
*21:41.400- 21:47.820* :  The BBC has learned that about 200 elite Afghan special forces trained and funded by the UK
*21:47.820- 21:53.720* :  face imminent deportation back to their homeland, now controlled by their former enemy, the Taliban.
*21:54.440- 21:59.700* :  The figures, gathered by a network of Afghan veterans, reveal the scale of what one
*21:59.980- 22:05.360* :  UK general called an absolute betrayal. The BBC's Joe Inwood has the story.
*22:08.740- 22:12.800* :  This was the sound of Afghanistan's most respected special forces in action.
*22:13.560- 22:19.480* :  They were called Commando Force 333, also known as the Triples. Their mission was to take
*22:19.480- 22:23.100* :  on the Taliban. Ali spent nearly two decades in the unit.
*22:25.220- 22:30.000* :  At first, we kidded out thousands of operations to destroy the drug trade.
*22:31.160- 22:35.800* :  Then after 2007, when the Taliban networks gradually started their activities,
*22:36.260- 22:39.620* :  we kidded out operations against them whenever they were.
*22:41.120- 22:45.560* :  Sir Richard Barons was deputy chief of the UK Defence Staff and knew them well.
*22:45.780- 22:51.400* :  The triples were at the front end of the UK's supported counterterrorism operation. They did
*22:51.400- 22:56.340* :  the most dangerous, the most difficult, the most important missions, a company by British soldiers
*22:56.340- 23:05.140* :  and did many things that British soldiers didn't do. We speak to Ali on a video call from
*23:05.140- 23:11.020* :  Pakistan. His life is very different now. He shows us around the tiny runway he has lived
*23:11.020- 23:16.320* :  for nearly two years with his wife and children. The family arrived here shortly after the Afghan
*23:16.320- 23:22.140* :  government collapse in 2021. He assumed his work with the UK forces would mean he got help,
*23:22.880- 23:27.400* :  but he was wrong. He applied to the Afghan relocation assistance program,
*23:27.400- 23:30.200* :  Arab, but was told he was not eligible.
*23:33.860- 23:39.740* :  I have been so disappointed. I served in a different high ranking positions and fell
*23:39.740- 23:45.600* :  my duties honestly. Despite that, Arab rejected my request twice.
*23:48.480- 23:53.840* :  And he's not the only one. We've been told there are around 200 former members of the
*23:53.840- 23:59.120* :  triples in Pakistan, either still waiting for help or rejected by the Arab scheme.
*23:59.920- 24:05.860* :  The reason they didn't work closely enough with the British, they were our allies, 18 years.
*24:06.740- 24:12.260* :  But according to Lieutenant General Abdul Khalid, who set up the unit, that is just not true.
*24:25.560- 24:31.420* :  He says the triples were entirely funded by the UK, something backed up by multiple other sources.
*24:34.620- 24:39.500* :  For Ali and the rest of the triples, the clock is ticking. Pakistan's government has started
*24:39.500- 24:44.580* :  deporting Afghans who don't have visas. He told us that that could be a death sentence.
*24:46.520- 24:52.720* :  We know of many former soldiers who were recognized and have disappeared, almost certainly killed.
*24:53.540- 24:58.980* :  When Iran and Pakistan deport people, the Taliban have a list in our biometric data.
*25:00.920- 25:05.960* :  So Richard Barrens agrees. If they sent back to Afghanistan, the Taliban will feel that they have
*25:05.960- 25:12.060* :  been handed back some of their most fierce opponents and the track record is they're either jailed
*25:12.060- 25:17.040* :  or killed. The Arab scheme is managed by the Ministry of Defense. In a statement, they said
*25:17.040- 25:22.980* :  each Arab application is assessed individually and in accordance with published policy. We do not
*25:22.980- 25:28.640* :  automatically make a decision on eligibility based on a job role. They also said the UK government
*25:28.640- 25:35.180* :  has brought around 24,600 Afghans to safety. Despite that, there is a fear that the treatment of
*25:35.180- 25:40.900* :  people like Ali will do lasting damage to the UK's reputation. That report by Joe Inwood.
*25:41.720- 25:46.360* :  A court in South Africa has ruled that President Cyril Ramaphosa's official crowning of the new
*25:46.360- 25:52.900* :  Zulu king last year was unlawful and invalid. It follows a legal challenge by the king's
*25:52.900- 25:58.360* :  half-brother, Prince Simacade, who says he is the rightful heir. Our African regional editor,
*25:58.360- 26:05.600* :  Richard Hamilton reports. When King Goodwill's Wella Teeny died in 2021, leaving six wives and at
*26:05.600- 26:12.500* :  least 28 children, there was understandably some confusion over the succession. Under Zulu custom,
*26:12.500- 26:18.680* :  the eldest son does not automatically become king and they've been vicious power struggles for
*26:18.680- 26:24.160* :  the throne in the past. The court stressed that it was not determining who was the rightful king,
*26:24.160- 26:30.300* :  but whether the president had followed proper procedures before recognizing King Mrs Zulu.
*26:30.960- 26:36.200* :  The move is likely to plunge the Zulu royal family already hit by claims of poisonings and
*26:36.200- 26:43.080* :  killings into further turmoil. The Zulu king does not have formal political power in South Africa
*26:43.080- 26:50.160* :  and his role is largely ceremonial, but he does remain hugely influential with an annual budget
*26:50.160- 26:56.780* :  of several million dollars. Richard Hamilton reporting. A BBC investigation has found that
*26:56.780- 27:02.440* :  spy cameras disguised as household objects are still for sale on Amazon, despite the firm being
*27:02.440- 27:07.220* :  sued in the US. The case has been brought by a woman who alleges that one of the gadgets was
*27:07.220- 27:11.620* :  used to film her in the bathroom. More details from our technology reporter Chris Valens.
*27:11.620- 27:16.420* :  One of the things I should say about the case in the US, this young woman, she was a foreign exchange
*27:16.420- 27:21.520* :  student, a camera that resembled a clothes hook was placed in the bathroom of the place she was staying
*27:21.520- 27:27.360* :  in and was used to film her. There's a gentleman who's awaiting trial for allegedly doing that.
*27:27.780- 27:34.460* :  That camera in its product listing had a picture showing a towel hanging from the camera
*27:35.060- 27:40.140* :  and the lawyers in their complaint point out, well, what a towel is used for. They typically used
*27:40.140- 27:47.680* :  drying naked bodies. I've been looking through Amazon.co.uk and there are a lot of different varieties
*27:47.680- 27:52.800* :  of cameras including these ones that are designed to look like hooks that you hang clothes on.
*27:53.360- 27:58.780* :  One of those showed the camera positioned above a bath, but there's one that resembles a clock
*27:58.780- 28:04.920* :  and the seller has got an image of it being used to film a clothed couple on a bed. I saw a
*28:04.920- 28:10.480* :  listing for one that was disguised as a smoke detector and it says it might be useful for monitoring
*28:10.480- 28:16.960* :  an unfaithful partner. There was even a listing of rather odd listing, I've got to be clear about
*28:16.960- 28:24.100* :  that, for a shower radio spy cam. So that was a camera disguised as a shower radio and you have
*28:24.100- 28:29.520* :  to wonder what would be the legitimate use for that. Amazon has declined to comment, but privacy
*28:29.520- 28:34.340* :  experts say that people misusing the hidden cameras could be breaking laws in other countries.
*28:35.680- 28:40.320* :  That was a site once thought to be too boring to excavate, but archaeologists in Italy
*28:40.320- 28:45.560* :  have uncovered a once thriving town that could challenge assumptions of the decline and fall of
*28:45.560- 28:51.760* :  the Roman Empire. Dr. Alessandro Lornaro, lead researcher from the classics faculty at the
*28:51.760- 28:58.380* :  University of Cambridge, told Michelle Hussain what they discovered. We found a meadling Roman town
*28:58.380- 29:06.080* :  that people thought was a village by the time of the Roman Empire, and in fact we revealed a very
*29:06.080- 29:12.300* :  detailed and comprehensive plan of a town of more than 20 actors, which is not very big, but the
*29:12.300- 29:17.920* :  average Roman town as you would expect and still featured all the kind of facilities, building,
*29:17.920- 29:23.460* :  structures that you would expect from a Roman town. So what was surprising about it? I think it's
*29:23.500- 29:29.240* :  continuity because the idea was that this town failed to take the challenges and opportunities
*29:29.240- 29:34.300* :  which the Roman Empire presented, but in fact what we found is that it was a very lively and thriving
*29:34.300- 29:39.200* :  town because it was very much embedded in its local regional network. So the fact is that a
*29:39.200- 29:44.940* :  benchmark for success of Roman communities in the Roman world is how far they were embedded and
*29:44.940- 29:50.040* :  integrated in the big thing that was the Roman Empire. What I think we found is that people could
*29:50.040- 29:55.900* :  thrive even if it had the margin of this big network and still play a part. Does it date from
*29:55.900- 30:02.800* :  a time when Rome itself is considered to have been in decline? The political decline of Rome and
*30:02.800- 30:08.080* :  the Empire started basically in the third century AD, and that is the term of fundamental
*30:08.080- 30:13.440* :  transformations. People debate whether we should qualify that as a decline or more of a fundamental
*30:14.140- 30:20.100* :  change, but when it comes to this town definitely Italy at by then by the second century,
*30:20.100- 30:24.980* :  so before the general crisis of the empire already entered the zone crisis that were not as important
*30:24.980- 30:30.300* :  as the way before and normally we would expect communities in Italy not to have thrived as well
*30:30.300- 30:35.620* :  as it did before. We read about welfare schemes introduced by emperor to support poor families,
*30:36.320- 30:40.380* :  commissioners and to manage their finances because apparently they weren't very good at it,
*30:40.700- 30:45.840* :  but in fact this story may be a bit different and that is what we hope this site may contribute
*30:45.840- 30:50.220* :  to the conversation. You mean essentially what you found here was a lot more developed or showed a
*30:50.220- 30:55.000* :  lot more affluence than you would have expected from the general history? Precisely, exactly there.
*30:55.060- 31:01.540* :  What's there? We found that the town boasted three bath complexes, a roof theater, which when
*31:01.540- 31:06.200* :  when it was found we thought it was an ordinary theater, but in fact turned out to originally to have
*31:06.200- 31:11.440* :  had a roof. That is a kind of a more elaborate, technically advanced work of engineering because
*31:11.440- 31:15.580* :  it's acoustic, it's better because of the wooden roof. And the fact that these people went for
*31:15.580- 31:21.340* :  such a choice doesn't really match the expectation of a secondary backwater town. It seems to
*31:21.340- 31:27.040* :  people were actually in the know about where the latest fashion in architecture. So despite the
*31:27.040- 31:33.480* :  marginal place within the network of empire, they're wearing a part of it in a different way.
*31:33.960- 31:39.520* :  Dr Alessandro Lunarro talking to Michelle has say. Now it is that time of year when
*31:39.520- 31:45.840* :  invitations come thick and fast. In fact, this Friday, the 15th of December, is statistically the
*31:45.840- 31:51.220* :  most popular night for hosting Christmas parties. But what if you don't really want to go?
*31:51.220- 31:57.920* :  The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology has published a study into how to say no and found
*31:57.920- 32:04.280* :  people overestimated how much offense it caused as Marion Straun reports. According to the
*32:04.280- 32:10.600* :  research, Matthew here has the right idea been straightforward and honest. Thank you so much.
*32:10.880- 32:14.700* :  I won't come as I've set that day aside to unwind. I hope you have a lovely time.
*32:15.060- 32:20.100* :  Don't make up excuses. Like I've suddenly got flu, though of course this next one has a good
*32:20.100- 32:26.540* :  chance of being true. Tested positive for Covid. The BBC spoke to some seasoned partygoers who had
*32:26.540- 32:32.740* :  differing views. First, his pastry chef, Ravneet Gill. In the food world, it feels like
*32:32.740- 32:37.120* :  everybody seems to launch their book on the same night. It's been to about two or three book
*32:37.120- 32:42.800* :  launches in one night and a dinner. So now I actually say no as my first response because I think
*32:42.800- 32:47.300* :  about the resentment that I'll harbor. The lies freak me out because I might get tangled up
*32:47.300- 32:53.520* :  as best not to come up with a lie. While broadcaster and actor Maria McCurlan thinks lying
*32:53.520- 32:58.040* :  might be the way forward. I'm not a verse to lying because I think it's a white lie
*32:58.040- 33:03.880* :  to save people's feelings. I'm really sorry I've already got an event that night and also
*33:04.260- 33:09.300* :  it's slightly egotistical to think that your absence will make much difference, you know,
*33:09.580- 33:14.800* :  and the trick is to always invite a third more than you want to come. The view in general is,
*33:14.800- 33:20.920* :  though, don't be afraid to say no. Although best to say yes sometimes for your own good,
*33:21.520- 33:25.280* :  you might even have a good time. That advice from Marion Storm.
*33:28.240- 33:32.300* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
*33:32.300- 33:36.020* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Emma Joseph,
