*00:00.080- 00:03.420* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:06.340- 00:10.000* :  I'm Rachel Wright, and in the early hours of Wednesday 20 December,
*00:10.000- 00:13.900* :  these are our main stories. Israel's president says this.
*00:14.660- 00:20.360* :  Israel is ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid
*00:20.360- 00:23.640* :  in order to enable the release of hostages.
*00:24.220- 00:29.240* :  A UN vote on a ceasefire in Gaza is delayed yet again to get the U.S. on board,
*00:29.860- 00:33.360* :  an anger about the plight of children in war ravaged Sudan.
*00:36.940- 00:42.920* :  Also in this podcast, China is hit by a large earthquake as Iceland's volcano erupts.
*00:43.320- 00:49.360* :  And there's a wonderful recipe which sounds fairly lethal. George Washington in the 1790s.
*00:49.660- 00:53.500* :  He served his eggnog with rum whiskey and sherry in it.
*00:53.860- 00:57.580* :  We get into the Christmas spirit by looking at some famous drinks recipes.
*01:03.860- 01:08.980* :  A vote on Gaza at the United Nations Security Council in New York has been delayed yet again
*01:09.020- 01:11.740* :  and won't now happen until Wednesday at the earliest.
*01:12.240- 01:15.420* :  Negotiations are continuing about the wording of a resolution
*01:15.420- 01:18.280* :  as global calls for a ceasefire intensify.
*01:18.280- 01:23.460* :  Israel is refusing to consider one and it continues to have the backing of the United States,
*01:24.000- 01:29.140* :  which has used its veto at the UN to support its closest ally and block a ceasefire.
*01:29.620- 01:33.600* :  The U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Washington
*01:33.600- 01:37.500* :  would stick to this. We don't support a permanent ceasefire at this time.
*01:37.500- 01:41.180* :  It would simply validate what Hamas did on the 7th of October.
*01:41.180- 01:46.140* :  It would leave them in power in Gaza, which is unacceptable to us and to our Israeli friends.
*01:46.520- 01:51.400* :  And of course, it would give them a much longer timeline to prepare and plan additional
*01:51.440- 01:55.380* :  attacks. We do support smaller, more localized, more targeted humanitarian
*01:55.380- 01:58.000* :  pauses to get hostages out and to get more aid in.
*01:58.560- 02:03.200* :  But the UN wants to show the world it can reach an agreement on the war, which has killed around
*02:03.200- 02:07.960* :  20,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.
*02:08.420- 02:11.120* :  The UN also wants to get more aid to civilians.
*02:11.120- 02:15.080* :  To do this, as the Security Council is trying to agree a resolution
*02:15.080- 02:19.740* :  calling for a suspension of hostilities, which could have the support of the U.S.
*02:20.120- 02:24.700* :  But our correspondent, Netta al-Feeq, who is at the UN in New York, said this wasn't
*02:24.700- 02:25.420* :  straightforward.
*02:25.980- 02:31.340* :  This time, the United States requested that the vote be postponed as negotiations continue.
*02:31.340- 02:35.860* :  And I actually asked the deputy ambassador, Robert Wood, just a short time ago,
*02:36.320- 02:39.000* :  if the United States is on board with this resolution.
*02:39.140- 02:40.920* :  And he said that it is just too early.
*02:40.920- 02:43.680* :  They are still working with the key players on this draft.
*02:43.680- 02:46.580* :  And they will see how negotiations go this afternoon.
*02:46.580- 02:51.080* :  But speaking to other diplomats, there are two key issues that the United States
*02:51.080- 02:52.680* :  still has with this draft.
*02:52.700- 02:56.860* :  Even though the language was changed to a suspension of hostilities,
*02:57.400- 03:01.100* :  there is still a phrase in there calling for urgent steps
*03:01.100- 03:03.740* :  towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.
*03:04.180- 03:07.820* :  The U.S. does not want to see that in there, it's uncomfortable with that language.
*03:08.480- 03:13.600* :  They are also getting concerns from Israel about this UN monitoring mechanism
*03:13.600- 03:17.380* :  that is being proposed to streamline aid in Gaza.
*03:17.440- 03:21.600* :  Israel feels like the mechanism would prevent them from controlling
*03:21.600- 03:25.420* :  and inspecting properly the delivery of humanitarian aid.
*03:25.940- 03:28.180* :  And so those are the key sticking points.
*03:28.180- 03:32.900* :  And it is why, despite diplomats thinking they were so close on an agreement
*03:32.940- 03:37.840* :  that we are now seeing this vote postponed continuously to try to bridge those gaps.
*03:38.460- 03:41.640* :  Well, it's been more than two months since Hamas broke out of Gaza,
*03:41.640- 03:44.400* :  killing more than 1,200 people in southern Israel.
*03:44.400- 03:48.400* :  Around 120 hostages are still believed to be held in Gaza.
*03:48.860- 03:52.420* :  Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, had this to say on Tuesday.
*03:53.080- 03:58.720* :  Israel is ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid
*03:59.300- 04:02.300* :  in order to enable the release of hostages.
*04:03.160- 04:08.520* :  And the responsibility lies fully with Sinwa and the leadership of Hamas.
*04:09.220- 04:14.340* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem Hugo Buscega listened to what Mr Herzog had to say.
*04:14.940- 04:20.000* :  Interesting choice of words by the Israeli president talking about a humanitarian pause.
*04:20.160- 04:25.520* :  The Israeli government has been rejecting any kind of proposal for a ceasefire.
*04:25.940- 04:29.520* :  The Americans have been supporting this view and they have been rejecting
*04:29.520- 04:36.940* :  growing international calls for a ceasefire in Gaza amid concerns over mounting civilian casualties
*04:36.940- 04:43.040* :  and also over the humanitarian situation in Gaza with the UN and aid organizations wanting
*04:43.040- 04:45.020* :  of a humanitarian catastrophe.
*04:45.020- 04:51.940* :  But it is also interesting that pressure is also growing domestically for the Israeli prime minister,
*04:51.940- 04:57.160* :  Benjamin Netanyahu, especially after those three Israeli hostages were killed by mistake
*04:57.160- 05:00.260* :  by Israeli soldiers in Gaza last week.
*05:00.640- 05:04.020* :  And the families of the hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza,
*05:04.020- 05:10.580* :  more than 100 hostages are now urging the government to engage in any kind of negotiations
*05:10.800- 05:15.260* :  with Hamas to reach a deal for more hostages to be freed.
*05:15.260- 05:21.340* :  And families are saying that time is running out for these captives to be freed alive.
*05:21.340- 05:23.900* :  So there is a lot of pressure on the government.
*05:23.900- 05:29.600* :  What is interesting is that Hamas is saying that no talks are going to take place unless the war
*05:29.600- 05:35.580* :  stops. And we've heard a number of times from the prime minister, from top Israeli officials that
*05:35.580- 05:40.980* :  the goal here is to not only guarantee the release of the hostages, but also to guarantee
*05:41.940- 05:43.860* :  the elimination of Hamas in Gaza.
*05:44.320- 05:48.080* :  Hugo Buscega. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky,
*05:48.080- 05:52.980* :  has rejected a suggestion that his country could be starting to lose the war against Russia.
*05:53.600- 05:58.440* :  At an end of year news conference in Kiev, he admitted that Ukraine faced challenges,
*05:58.440- 06:02.420* :  but said he was confident his allies would not let the country down.
*06:02.420- 06:05.280* :  He's our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams.
*06:05.940- 06:08.700* :  Ukraine and its leader are facing a hard winter.
*06:09.080- 06:14.060* :  President Zelensky revealed today that he's considering costly proposals to mobilize a further
*06:14.060- 06:20.100* :  half a million people. It comes as commanders report ammunition shortages across the long front line.
*06:20.220- 06:26.720* :  Packages of US and EU support to Ukraine, military and economic are stuck, probably at least
*06:26.720- 06:32.380* :  until the new year. Mr. Zelensky was asked by the BBC if he thought there was a danger Ukraine
*06:32.380- 06:39.020* :  was losing the war. We don't control the skies. We don't have enough ammunition,
*06:39.160- 06:42.300* :  but that doesn't mean that we will not find a solution.
*06:42.300- 06:47.580* :  But for this, we really need support because we're simply lack some weaponry.
*06:47.620- 06:53.060* :  Its president Zelensky's job to strike a defiant and positive tone to try to rally his country.
*06:53.060- 06:57.780* :  But earlier this year there were big hopes of a breakthrough with an eagerly anticipated
*06:57.780- 07:02.720* :  Ukrainian counter-offensive that in the end hasn't done much to change the front lines.
*07:03.440- 07:08.200* :  Asked about a reported rift between the president and his top general, Valeriy Zeluzhnyi,
*07:08.560- 07:12.300* :  Mr. Zelensky insisted the two still had a good working relationship.
*07:13.260- 07:17.880* :  On the question of how long the war might take, the president said no one could answer that.
*07:18.520- 07:21.220* :  But Ukraine said would not be let down by its partners.
*07:22.060- 07:26.880* :  And what if Donald Trump returned to the White House after next year's US presidential election?
*07:26.940- 07:30.600* :  Mr. Zelensky said he didn't think US policy would change.
*07:30.600- 07:34.960* :  But if it did, he acknowledged this could have a significant impact on the war.
*07:35.780- 07:41.060* :  Paul Adams. Meanwhile, the Russian president Vladimir Putin has told a meeting of his top
*07:41.060- 07:46.200* :  military officials that he would be prepared to talk about the future of Ukraine with Western leaders.
*07:46.200- 07:49.660* :  But he said his country would not give up what was theirs.
*07:50.200- 07:55.140* :  After its invasion last year, Russian forces have claimed four additional regions of Ukraine.
*07:55.780- 07:58.040* :  Here's our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg.
*07:58.700- 08:01.300* :  At the Russian defense ministry, a minute silence.
*08:04.200- 08:09.360* :  Army chiefs and the commander-in-chief Vladimir Putin honored Russia's war dead.
*08:10.100- 08:13.220* :  Nearly two years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*08:13.220- 08:15.120* :  that Mr. Putin had ordered.
*08:18.060- 08:20.780* :  In his address, President Putin was defiant.
*08:21.620- 08:26.960* :  He argued that in Ukraine, Russia had gained the initiative despite Western assistance for Kiev.
*08:27.700- 08:32.020* :  Attempts by the West to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia had, he said,
*08:32.020- 08:35.920* :  been shattered by the courage and persistence of Russian soldiers.
*08:36.980- 08:39.900* :  He claimed that Russia didn't want to fight NATO or Europe.
*08:40.560- 08:46.280* :  But it's clear that when it comes to Ukraine, the Kremlin expects any peace to be on Russia's terms.
*08:47.040- 08:51.080* :  His so-called special military operation has not gone at all to plan.
*08:51.760- 08:56.000* :  But the Kremlin leader can sense growing Ukraine fatigue in the West.
*08:56.540- 09:02.080* :  He will have noted the difficulty President Zelensky had in trying to secure a fresh aid package
*09:02.080- 09:02.900* :  from the Americans.
*09:03.660- 09:07.180* :  He knows there's a chance that Donald Trump will return to the White House.
*09:08.080- 09:10.080* :  That's why he's sounding confident.
*09:10.420- 09:11.920* :  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow.
*09:12.580- 09:17.280* :  At least 127 people have been killed in one of China's deadliest earthquakes.
*09:17.280- 09:22.620* :  Measuring a 6.2 magnitude, the quake hit the mountainous Gang-Soo province.
*09:22.620- 09:27.800* :  While power has been restored to the region, icy conditions threaten rescue efforts,
*09:28.180- 09:30.700* :  with more than 700 people reported injured.
*09:31.260- 09:36.600* :  The number of people displaced remains unclear, but many residents are now faced with harsh conditions.
*09:39.660- 09:43.560* :  I've never experienced something like this, and I'm 70 years old.
*09:44.020- 09:46.860* :  I've never experienced such a big one.
*09:47.100- 09:52.240* :  I'm afraid now I have no place to live.
*09:52.820- 09:54.960* :  In my home, there is a single room left intact.
*09:55.180- 09:56.400* :  What should I do?
*09:56.740- 10:00.080* :  Now we have nothing.
*10:00.120- 10:03.340* :  We can only wait for the rescue workers from the government.
*10:04.440- 10:07.800* :  Earlier, I spoke to our Chinese media analyst, Carrie Allen.
*10:08.220- 10:13.720* :  There's a lot of media in China stressing that this is very unusual for an earthquake to happen
*10:13.720- 10:16.160* :  in this region. It's in the northwest of China.
*10:16.500- 10:20.600* :  The earthquake has spanned across two provinces known as Gang-Soo and Ching Hai,
*10:21.080- 10:25.740* :  and a lot of houses in this region are not built for earthquakes, and it's quite a densely
*10:25.740- 10:31.640* :  populated region. This has really been a factor in why there's been so much damage,
*10:31.640- 10:34.400* :  not only because of this, because a lot of houses have collapsed.
*10:34.400- 10:38.340* :  Also, there's a lot of mountains, so there have been mudslides and landslides,
*10:38.640- 10:40.840* :  and also just factoring in the time of year as well.
*10:40.840- 10:42.580* :  It's extremely cold in these regions.
*10:42.580- 10:47.900* :  We're talking temperatures of around minus 15 to minus 9 degrees Celsius.
*10:48.500- 10:51.480* :  And where are people expected to shelter them?
*10:51.500- 10:55.920* :  As you say, over 5,000 buildings have been affected, and it's really cold.
*10:56.240- 11:00.760* :  One of the good things is that China has a very large population of 1.4 billion people.
*11:00.760- 11:05.720* :  So when something like this happens, it's able to mobilize people from other areas,
*11:06.260- 11:10.980* :  firefighters, the military, police come in to be able to help out, and police dogs as well.
*11:11.380- 11:15.040* :  So this has been the big focus in state media today. There's been a lot of attention on
*11:15.160- 11:18.480* :  relief workers rushing to the area and being able to help out.
*11:18.800- 11:22.420* :  And what I've been watching on CCTV, which is the National Broadcaster,
*11:22.640- 11:26.340* :  is tents being set up for people who have lost their homes.
*11:26.360- 11:28.880* :  So there's been a lot of footage of this today on television.
*11:29.540- 11:33.960* :  Obviously, sometimes it's difficult to find out what's really happening on Chinese media.
*11:34.040- 11:36.740* :  Would you say that this is a little bit more transparent?
*11:37.520- 11:39.820* :  Yeah, well, I think it's because it's a developing story.
*11:39.820- 11:43.380* :  And also, China's had lessons learned in the past from previous earthquakes.
*11:43.380- 11:49.140* :  There was a major earthquake back in 2008 in an area called Wenchuan in Sichuan,
*11:49.180- 11:51.220* :  which is a southwestern province in the country.
*11:51.680- 11:56.360* :  And lots of people died then, and there is commemoration of that earthquake every year.
*11:56.360- 12:00.600* :  There is an acknowledgement in China that earthquakes can be very devastating.
*12:00.600- 12:03.220* :  Again, because of China's very dense population.
*12:03.480- 12:06.460* :  So, yes, I've seen lots of live streams running today,
*12:06.460- 12:09.480* :  really trying to bring people information on the latest,
*12:10.100- 12:12.940* :  and really just to show how much the government is doing.
*12:12.980- 12:14.280* :  I mean, we have to factor in as well.
*12:14.280- 12:18.260* :  This is China, so it's a country that is dominated by state media
*12:18.260- 12:21.840* :  that really wants to paint the government in a very positive light.
*12:22.340- 12:26.140* :  So a real emphasis on what the government and the authorities are doing
*12:26.140- 12:28.600* :  to help is very much dominating media coverage.
*12:29.460- 12:29.980* :  Gary Allen.
*12:30.740- 12:35.060* :  Now, here's a story with a warning for anyone finding old things in the attic.
*12:35.720- 12:39.720* :  A second-hand dealer in France has won a case to keep more than four million euros
*12:39.720- 12:45.060* :  from the sale of a rare African mask he found in an elderly French couple's attic.
*12:45.620- 12:50.060* :  The dealer, who's not been named, was taken to court by the couple who sold him the mask
*12:50.060- 12:51.600* :  for 150 euros.
*12:52.240- 12:56.540* :  They wanted the sale stopped, arguing that the dealer must have had prior knowledge
*12:56.540- 12:58.140* :  of the mask's true value.
*12:58.640- 13:00.360* :  From Paris, here's Huesco Field.
*13:00.960- 13:03.700* :  The couple, both in their 80s, were clearing out a house,
*13:03.720- 13:07.520* :  and the dealer took a load of brick-a-brake off their hands for a nominal price.
*13:08.000- 13:12.060* :  Among the items was a wooden mask, which the couple said had been brought from Africa
*13:12.060- 13:13.220* :  by an ancestor.
*13:13.880- 13:18.640* :  The dealer then had the mask valued, was told it was in fact an extremely rare object
*13:18.640- 13:20.620* :  of which only a few others were known to exist.
*13:20.620- 13:25.400* :  And at auction last year, it went for a monumental 4.2 million euros.
*13:25.420- 13:30.360* :  The couple then went to court, saying they'd been defrauded because the dealer must have
*13:30.360- 13:33.040* :  at least suspected the value of the mask.
*13:33.300- 13:36.780* :  But the court ruled that no, it was just the dealer's good luck.
*13:36.780- 13:40.100* :  It was the sellers, the judge said, who are actually at fault
*13:40.100- 13:43.900* :  because they should themselves have done due diligence and had the mask
*13:43.960- 13:46.900* :  looked at my experts before they decided to sell.
*13:47.640- 13:51.060* :  Huesco Field is less than a week until Christmas,
*13:51.060- 13:53.920* :  and to help you prepare for your feasting for the days ahead,
*13:53.920- 13:55.480* :  we are focusing on drinks.
*13:56.020- 13:59.860* :  James Cooper is a Christmas expert and talked Sarah Montague
*13:59.860- 14:02.540* :  through the history of some hot festive tipples.
*14:03.140- 14:06.800* :  The earliest records of warming wine in putting some spices in it,
*14:06.800- 14:08.200* :  which is basically wild wine,
*14:08.200- 14:09.180* :  and goes back to the Romans.
*14:09.400- 14:12.320* :  And it's thought that they probably took their wine from Italy
*14:12.560- 14:14.480* :  when they're traveling around France and Spain,
*14:14.480- 14:17.400* :  and bought their warm wine with them up into Northern Europe.
*14:17.680- 14:20.580* :  We've got an early record in a medieval English cookery book from
*14:20.580- 14:22.620* :  £30.90 of a mould wine as well.
*14:22.760- 14:24.100* :  But then it sort of disappeared.
*14:24.760- 14:26.300* :  And during the Anglo-Saxon period,
*14:26.300- 14:27.540* :  an onward to Wasail,
*14:27.920- 14:30.440* :  which was sort of mould beer with apples and cream.
*14:30.740- 14:33.440* :  And it's where we get some of our customs from,
*14:33.440- 14:36.880* :  like toasting because it was the communal bowl of Wasail,
*14:36.880- 14:39.020* :  and it needs good health in Anglo-Saxon.
*14:39.200- 14:40.540* :  So you go out to the apple orchards,
*14:40.600- 14:42.400* :  you'd march around the apple trees,
*14:42.940- 14:44.540* :  making some noise, singing some songs,
*14:44.540- 14:46.020* :  scaring away the evil spirits,
*14:46.020- 14:47.940* :  waking the apple trees up for the harvest,
*14:47.940- 14:50.780* :  and you'd pour some of the Wasail over the roots to give them a feed.
*14:51.200- 14:53.420* :  But you'd also put toasted bread in them.
*14:53.600- 14:56.920* :  And you might even lift up a bit of the toast from the Wasail bowl
*14:57.280- 14:58.480* :  and put it in the apple trees,
*14:58.820- 15:00.560* :  and that's where we get to raise a toast from.
*15:00.900- 15:01.120* :  Wow.
*15:01.460- 15:03.620* :  And the basis of it is beer, is it?
*15:03.780- 15:06.900* :  Yeah, it was a mould ale that you added curdled cream,
*15:06.900- 15:08.360* :  and then you roasted apples,
*15:08.840- 15:09.860* :  and sometimes your eggs,
*15:10.240- 15:12.340* :  clothes, ginger nutmeg, that sort of thing.
*15:12.500- 15:14.280* :  Eggnog, that's not so common,
*15:14.280- 15:16.360* :  at least this side of the Atlantic any longer.
*15:16.360- 15:19.560* :  Where does eggnog come from and why Christmas?
*15:19.560- 15:21.260* :  Yeah, we now sort of think of it
*15:21.260- 15:23.580* :  as this sort of vaguely strange American import,
*15:23.720- 15:25.400* :  but it started in the UK.
*15:25.400- 15:29.300* :  It was a medieval drink that was hot milk mixed
*15:29.340- 15:31.080* :  with wine or ale and spices,
*15:31.420- 15:33.780* :  and it was given to you when you had the cold or the flu.
*15:33.840- 15:36.740* :  It was also known as a posit in the mid 1700s.
*15:36.740- 15:38.020* :  It was really picked up in America,
*15:38.600- 15:39.500* :  and taken over there,
*15:39.900- 15:43.120* :  and they got more into the sherry and brandy and rum side of it
*15:43.120- 15:45.340* :  and made it their Christmas drink.
*15:45.400- 15:48.200* :  There's a wonderful recipe which sounds fairly lethal.
*15:48.560- 15:50.740* :  George Washington, in the 1790s,
*15:51.100- 15:54.540* :  he served his eggnog with rum whiskey and sherry in it,
*15:54.580- 15:55.980* :  which sounds fairly potent.
*15:56.600- 15:58.600* :  James Cooper speaking to Sarah Montague.
*16:01.700- 16:04.600* :  Still to come, the DNA evidence showing how people
*16:05.060- 16:06.560* :  travelled around the Roman Empire.
*16:07.240- 16:12.400* :  It's hugely interesting how he came to be from the edge of the empire
*16:12.680- 16:14.600* :  to end up his life in a Cambridgeer ditch.
*16:22.380- 16:25.200* :  The worst child displacement crisis in the world.
*16:25.680- 16:29.200* :  That's how the United Nations describes the situation in Sudan
*16:29.200- 16:33.460* :  where the war between the army and the paramilitary rapid support forces
*16:33.780- 16:37.280* :  has driven more than three and a half million children from their homes.
*16:37.280- 16:40.820* :  Many have been caught up in the recent escalation in violence
*16:40.820- 16:44.700* :  with the rebels advancing into Wad-Madani south of Cartoon.
*16:45.200- 16:48.220* :  Our correspondent in the Horn of Africa, Calcutta and Yebital,
*16:48.240- 16:50.600* :  told me more about the significance of this.
*16:51.200- 16:54.400* :  It had hundreds of thousands of people from Haratun,
*16:54.400- 16:57.580* :  from other areas that were pushed out of their homes.
*16:58.020- 17:00.340* :  So it had this large displaced population,
*17:00.800- 17:04.120* :  and now as the violence is reaching into this city,
*17:04.120- 17:07.780* :  these people are finding themselves on the move again.
*17:08.160- 17:11.760* :  So according to the UN, hundreds of thousands have fled the city already,
*17:11.760- 17:15.540* :  and statements and remarks that we managed to find from aid agencies
*17:15.540- 17:18.620* :  suggest that people are scattered in all directions
*17:18.620- 17:22.160* :  without any area that they're supposed to arrive at.
*17:22.160- 17:26.180* :  So they're moving with their clothes and little on their backs
*17:26.180- 17:28.520* :  and fleeing the city on foot.
*17:29.020- 17:30.980* :  This war is terrible for everyone,
*17:30.980- 17:32.860* :  but as the UN has pointed out,
*17:32.860- 17:35.640* :  it's particularly terrible for children.
*17:36.020- 17:40.000* :  Yes, this conflict has been one of the worst humanitarian crisis
*17:40.000- 17:41.220* :  in the world right now.
*17:41.600- 17:43.740* :  Seven million people in Sudan are displaced.
*17:43.740- 17:47.120* :  More people are seeking refuge in neighboring countries
*17:47.120- 17:48.900* :  like Egypt, Ethiopia and Chad.
*17:49.340- 17:53.040* :  Among those people that are impacted are a huge number of them are children.
*17:53.560- 17:56.760* :  The UN's children agency UNICEF was saying that children
*17:56.760- 17:59.620* :  are disproportionately impacted by this conflict,
*17:59.620- 18:04.560* :  and it seems that the situation is likely to worsen rather than get better.
*18:05.020- 18:09.760* :  The Sudanese forces and the government say that the UAE is backing up
*18:09.820- 18:12.420* :  and supporting the rapid support forces.
*18:12.440- 18:13.860* :  What evidence do we have of this?
*18:14.220- 18:17.740* :  There are reports of increased influence by the UA
*18:17.740- 18:20.420* :  in the Horn of Africa region, not just in Sudan,
*18:20.420- 18:23.140* :  but in countries like Ethiopia and even in Chad as well.
*18:23.440- 18:26.520* :  The Sudanese army forces, senior military officials,
*18:26.520- 18:29.480* :  have been very adamant and they use the strong words
*18:29.480- 18:33.440* :  in accusing the United Arab Emirates of providing weapons to Chad
*18:33.440- 18:35.880* :  and providing other military equipment
*18:35.880- 18:38.120* :  to the rapid support forces as well.
*18:38.460- 18:41.300* :  The UAE of course denied these accusations
*18:41.300- 18:44.280* :  that brought diplomatic spots between the two countries
*18:44.280- 18:47.140* :  and they expelled Sudanese diplomats from their country
*18:47.140- 18:49.720* :  and the Sudanese did the same letter as well.
*18:50.040- 18:51.080* :  But one thing is certain
*18:51.080- 18:53.320* :  and that is the United Arab Emirates' influence
*18:53.820- 18:55.560* :  is growing across the Horn of Africa
*18:56.120- 18:58.780* :  and it seems that it's going to continue to do so.
*18:59.380- 19:00.520* :  Kalkuddin Nehbutel
*19:00.780- 19:03.980* :  It's a volcanic eruption that could last months rather than weeks,
*19:04.440- 19:06.560* :  at least according to scientists in Iceland
*19:06.560- 19:09.440* :  who are studying the Fischer which broke open on Monday night.
*19:09.980- 19:13.020* :  The nearby fishing town of Grindavik was evacuated
*19:13.020- 19:15.760* :  when intense seismic activity indicated
*19:15.760- 19:17.280* :  that an eruption was imminent.
*19:17.920- 19:21.340* :  Bionni Benedixson is Iceland's Minister for Foreign Affairs.
*19:21.880- 19:24.460* :  He told the BBC how significant it is.
*19:24.880- 19:28.560* :  Suddenly around 9 o'clock last night we had a big earthquake
*19:28.560- 19:32.460* :  and just a little over an hour later the eruption started.
*19:32.460- 19:37.940* :  It is a much larger fischer than we have seen in the past three years
*19:37.940- 19:40.620* :  where we have had smaller eruptions
*19:40.680- 19:44.660* :  but luckily it is in an area which does not threaten
*19:45.200- 19:47.400* :  at the moment the town of Grindavik
*19:47.460- 19:49.900* :  and it does not threaten infrastructure.
*19:50.720- 19:53.520* :  A correspondence of fear but it is in Iceland
*19:53.520- 19:54.820* :  and sent us this update.
*19:55.380- 19:59.100* :  The authorities are urging everybody not to come to this area
*19:59.420- 20:02.460* :  for their safety but also to allow scientists
*20:02.460- 20:05.380* :  to assess the situation on the ground.
*20:05.500- 20:10.240* :  We can smell the smoke, we can see ashes in the air,
*20:10.540- 20:12.980* :  we can sometimes feel the vibration
*20:13.660- 20:16.100* :  under our feet and we can definitely hear
*20:16.100- 20:18.560* :  the sound of the volcano in the distance
*20:18.560- 20:21.120* :  and just to give you an idea of the situation
*20:21.200- 20:23.360* :  when we were in Reykjavik the capital
*20:23.360- 20:25.420* :  which is about 30 kilometers away.
*20:25.420- 20:30.640* :  We could immediately see the orange flames coming out of the volcano
*20:31.020- 20:35.720* :  and that gives you an idea of just how powerful this eruption is.
*20:36.020- 20:38.540* :  In the last few hours I have spoken to several people
*20:38.540- 20:41.640* :  who have come here to take selfies, take photos,
*20:41.640- 20:44.500* :  take videos of the volcano but they are all tourists.
*20:44.500- 20:47.100* :  There were people from India, the UK, the US
*20:47.100- 20:49.720* :  who thought this was an amazing view
*20:49.720- 20:51.420* :  that they did not want to miss.
*20:51.840- 20:53.580* :  But when I spoke to somebody from Iceland
*20:53.580- 20:56.940* :  and I asked him, are you concerned, are you scared?
*20:57.400- 20:58.740* :  And he just looked at me and said
*20:58.740- 21:01.820* :  this is just a regular Tuesday for people in Iceland.
*21:01.820- 21:04.000* :  The authorities had been preparing for weeks.
*21:04.000- 21:07.800* :  There is a town nearby that had been evacuated weeks ago
*21:07.800- 21:09.840* :  and so what the authorities here are saying
*21:09.840- 21:13.240* :  is that they are fully prepared, there is no threat to life
*21:13.240- 21:16.520* :  and that they are hoping that the people who live near the volcano
*21:16.520- 21:18.400* :  will be able to return home soon.
*21:19.120- 21:22.840* :  Sophia Petitsa reporting on a regular Tuesday in Iceland.
*21:23.920- 21:26.280* :  At the height of its power two millennia ago
*21:26.280- 21:29.960* :  the Roman Empire stretched from the north of England to southern Egypt
*21:29.960- 21:33.760* :  and from Armenia in the east to the shores of Portugal and the West
*21:33.760- 21:36.760* :  and it seems that people moved around a lot.
*21:37.360- 21:40.720* :  New DNA analysis proves that a 2,000 year old skeleton
*21:40.720- 21:42.900* :  found in Cambridge in eastern England
*21:42.900- 21:45.940* :  is of a young man who lived in what is now Ukraine.
*21:46.060- 21:48.920* :  Our science correspondent Palab Gosh reports.
*21:49.620- 21:53.320* :  This latest research marks the conclusion of a detective story
*21:53.900- 21:56.360* :  one which has used cutting edge forensic science
*21:56.360- 21:59.160* :  to unravel the mystery of an ordinary person.
*21:59.780- 22:02.320* :  A young man buried in a ditch in Cambridge
*22:03.020- 22:09.240* :  between 126 and 228 AD during the Roman occupation of Britain.
*22:10.200- 22:14.440* :  Researchers extracted DNA from a tiny bone in his inner ear
*22:14.920- 22:17.600* :  which was the best preserved part of the entire skeleton.
*22:18.480- 22:20.900* :  They were able to establish that he was a summation
*22:21.500- 22:24.620* :  and nomadic people from what's now southern Russia and Ukraine.
*22:25.860- 22:28.840* :  Roman documents show that five and a half thousand of them
*22:29.180- 22:31.200* :  were accruited to the empire's cavalry
*22:31.200- 22:34.660* :  because of their horse riding skills and posted to Britain.
*22:35.280- 22:36.860* :  But according to Dr. Alex Smith,
*22:37.460- 22:40.680* :  this is a first biological proof of their presence here.
*22:41.000- 22:45.840* :  It's hugely interesting how he came to be from the edge of the empire
*22:46.140- 22:48.080* :  to end up his life in a Cambridgeer ditch.
*22:48.560- 22:50.920* :  We're starting to see these people in the countryside
*22:50.920- 22:52.980* :  that come from all different parts of the empire.
*22:53.200- 22:55.440* :  It says that there was much greater movement
*22:55.440- 22:57.940* :  not just to the cities but also in the countryside
*22:57.940- 22:59.720* :  than there ever was previously.
*23:00.140- 23:03.660* :  The new scientific techniques tell the stories of ordinary people
*23:04.240- 23:06.620* :  rather than those of the wealthy and powerful
*23:07.140- 23:10.140* :  who usually dominate the records of great historical events.
*23:10.960- 23:16.520* :  Al-Abgosh, critics of the recent COP28 climate summit in Dubai say
*23:16.520- 23:20.340* :  it was a toothless deal full of loopholes which in fact failed
*23:20.340- 23:24.100* :  to realistically phase out or even reduce fossil fuel use.
*23:24.600- 23:28.540* :  But others point to the fact that the deals struck by some 200 countries
*23:28.980- 23:31.760* :  did promise to transition away from fossil fuels.
*23:32.500- 23:34.480* :  One of the main people pushing for more to be done
*23:34.500- 23:36.860* :  to tackle climate change is the US special
*23:36.860- 23:39.560* :  presidential envoy for climate John Kerry.
*23:40.080- 23:41.980* :  Celia Hatton has been speaking to him.
*23:42.400- 23:43.820* :  I think the deal is historic.
*23:43.820- 23:47.260* :  I think it's a landmark decision with profound implications
*23:47.420- 23:51.080* :  for the simple reason that it's extraordinarily difficult
*23:51.080- 23:54.500* :  in international affairs to get almost 200 countries
*23:54.500- 23:57.420* :  to come together, some of which produce gas and all.
*23:57.880- 23:58.860* :  And don't want to change.
*23:59.420- 24:04.640* :  But everybody signed on to say we must transition away from fossil fuels.
*24:05.600- 24:08.520* :  To bring almost 200 nations together,
*24:08.520- 24:10.940* :  to transition away from fossil fuels,
*24:10.940- 24:13.640* :  and then add all these other initiatives
*24:14.360- 24:17.140* :  I think it's one of the most significant cops I've ever attended.
*24:17.340- 24:19.400* :  The key now is implementation.
*24:19.940- 24:22.680* :  There are some who contend that the language and the deal
*24:22.960- 24:24.280* :  simply isn't strong enough.
*24:24.280- 24:28.040* :  It was watered down too much in order to achieve consensus.
*24:28.040- 24:30.840* :  So for example, a climate scientist like Michael Mann,
*24:31.440- 24:33.040* :  they're disappointed with the final agreement,
*24:33.040- 24:37.160* :  which stops short of a commitment to phase out fossil fuels.
*24:37.160- 24:40.100* :  Michael Mann says it's like the doctor telling you
*24:40.100- 24:43.380* :  you have diabetes and you say you will just transition away
*24:43.680- 24:44.960* :  from having donuts.
*24:44.960- 24:45.860* :  What would you say to them?
*24:46.140- 24:48.000* :  I would say I respect Michael Mann.
*24:48.000- 24:50.880* :  I'd follow them and listen to him and he's great advocate.
*24:51.540- 24:52.540* :  But I disagree with him.
*24:52.660- 24:55.900* :  What is the difference between everybody saying we're going to transition away?
*24:56.220- 24:56.880* :  Away is away.
*24:57.200- 24:57.620* :  You're gone.
*24:57.820- 24:58.760* :  You have a transition.
*24:59.020- 24:59.500* :  Wait a minute.
*24:59.520- 25:00.480* :  No, you have to transition.
*25:00.520- 25:01.920* :  There's no choice but to transition.
*25:02.220- 25:03.520* :  You can't just stop it tomorrow.
*25:03.520- 25:05.600* :  Every economy in the world shuts down.
*25:06.020- 25:08.220* :  Every person driving to work won't have gas.
*25:08.220- 25:09.880* :  Of course, it's a transition.
*25:10.260- 25:12.560* :  You're never going to get 200 countries,
*25:12.740- 25:16.380* :  a lot of whom drill for gas and oil and sell it in the world.
*25:16.380- 25:18.940* :  Do you think they're going to sign on and say tomorrow we're not doing it?
*25:19.220- 25:19.420* :  No.
*25:20.160- 25:22.660* :  So we have to do this with a reality check.
*25:22.940- 25:23.980* :  But what is happening?
*25:23.980- 25:24.960* :  I assure you.
*25:24.960- 25:25.520* :  I know this.
*25:25.520- 25:26.560* :  I've followed this for years.
*25:27.020- 25:29.380* :  Is a rate of transition that is growing?
*25:30.000- 25:31.340* :  Is it fast enough today?
*25:31.760- 25:31.940* :  No.
*25:32.240- 25:33.380* :  Is it big enough today?
*25:33.740- 25:33.960* :  No.
*25:33.960- 25:39.840* :  But I do know that everything I'm seeing happening is bigger and faster than it was last year
*25:39.900- 25:41.120* :  and a year before it.
*25:41.480- 25:45.260* :  There's just a whole bunch of things which will move us faster
*25:45.420- 25:46.920* :  than if we hadn't gotten agreement.
*25:46.920- 25:48.020* :  How would people like that?
*25:48.580- 25:50.960* :  Is this deal enough to keep 1.5 alive?
*25:51.020- 25:51.720* :  No, not yet.
*25:51.860- 25:52.840* :  But it's very close.
*25:53.000- 25:57.220* :  When we began in 2021, we were headed to 3.7
*25:57.560- 26:00.500* :  or four degrees of warming on the planet because of Glasgow
*26:00.780- 26:02.140* :  and because of Sharma Shaykh.
*26:02.620- 26:04.320* :  The IEA came back and said,
*26:04.320- 26:06.360* :  if you do everything you promise to do,
*26:06.360- 26:09.640* :  you would be by 2050 at 1.8 degrees
*26:09.920- 26:12.280* :  or 1.7 degrees after Sharma Shaykh.
*26:12.360- 26:15.800* :  Now, with all of the additional promises that are on the table,
*26:15.920- 26:20.500* :  we have the ability we think to achieve 1.5 or very close to it.
*26:20.780- 26:24.140* :  I'd like to focus for a moment on what is going on inside the United States.
*26:24.140- 26:27.700* :  US crude oil exports in the first half of this year
*26:27.700- 26:30.680* :  averaged just under four million barrels per day,
*26:30.680- 26:34.140* :  which is a record high for the first half of a year since 2015.
*26:34.300- 26:41.300* :  A third of the world's planned oil and gas expansion right up to 2050 will occur in the US.
*26:41.300- 26:44.720* :  So how will the US meet its climate change goals?
*26:44.920- 26:47.580* :  Well, we're going to meet them and that's a tailing down,
*26:47.580- 26:49.680* :  ultimately, that's a tail-off.
*26:49.900- 26:51.940* :  We have six years between now and 2030.
*26:52.460- 26:56.820* :  We're regrettably demand on a global basis is extremely high.
*26:56.980- 26:58.560* :  And what about demand inside the United States?
*26:58.720- 27:01.180* :  Well, it's also very high. It's uncomfortably high,
*27:01.180- 27:02.840* :  but that is changing.
*27:03.480- 27:06.940* :  US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry,
*27:07.300- 27:08.720* :  speaking to Celia Hatton.
*27:09.580- 27:12.260* :  On the 16th of August, Shannon Coggins,
*27:12.260- 27:14.740* :  Theo Simon and their daughter Rosa,
*27:15.140- 27:20.120* :  left the south of England to begin a 16,000 kilometre journey to Sydney in Australia
*27:20.600- 27:23.060* :  in order to attend the wedding of Shannon's sister.
*27:23.600- 27:24.680* :  Sounds kind of normal, right?
*27:25.200- 27:29.320* :  What makes their journey so remarkable is they wanted to get there without flying
*27:29.320- 27:31.080* :  because of its impact on the climate.
*27:31.680- 27:32.940* :  So how did they get on?
*27:33.400- 27:36.500* :  James Reynolds caught up with Shannon and her family for the BBC.
*27:37.260- 27:40.880* :  My sister decided to emigrate to Australia 16 years ago,
*27:41.280- 27:43.120* :  four years after I gave up flying.
*27:43.540- 27:46.800* :  I've been saving up money to come and visit her ever since then.
*27:47.520- 27:50.280* :  So when the wedding invitation came through, it's time to jump.
*27:50.740- 27:54.000* :  Finally, do the thing I've been planning for all these years
*27:54.400- 27:56.220* :  and try and get to Australia overland.
*27:56.980- 27:58.480* :  What route have you taken?
*27:59.320- 28:01.960* :  It's been hard because a lot of places,
*28:02.620- 28:05.200* :  especially since COVID, haven't reopened their borders.
*28:05.580- 28:07.980* :  So we've had to jiggle it around quite a lot our route.
*28:08.300- 28:09.840* :  We were planning on going through Azerbaijan,
*28:09.840- 28:12.560* :  but they did not open their land borders.
*28:12.960- 28:15.780* :  So instead, we had to get a transit visa through Russia
*28:16.240- 28:20.520* :  and go up around the north instead, which if I'm honest, James,
*28:20.520- 28:21.980* :  that was a bit scary that bit.
*28:22.180- 28:24.700* :  That was probably the hardest bit for obvious reasons.
*28:24.700- 28:27.500* :  We just have to pop through the southern corner of Russia
*28:28.020- 28:31.900* :  to get to Kazakhstan and then go across Kazakhstan on the train,
*28:31.900- 28:33.840* :  which was an incredible journey, actually,
*28:34.440- 28:37.600* :  to the border with China, which had only just opened up.
*28:37.900- 28:39.840* :  And so we were able to get the bus into China.
*28:40.340- 28:41.980* :  So that was all a bit of a challenge, yeah.
*28:42.140- 28:45.540* :  But I know that at one point, your commitment to not flying
*28:45.580- 28:48.480* :  came up against that other unbreakable commitment
*28:49.120- 28:49.840* :  to get there.
*28:49.840- 28:54.460* :  What happened when those two things came together and clashed?
*28:54.660- 28:56.800* :  I mean, we always knew we had to accept.
*28:57.100- 28:58.940* :  We might need to fly at some point on this journey.
*28:58.940- 29:01.920* :  For all we knew, we were going to have to fly into China.
*29:01.920- 29:02.780* :  We just didn't know.
*29:03.220- 29:04.440* :  But we were trying not to.
*29:04.740- 29:07.400* :  We know that it's really hard to find the time
*29:07.480- 29:08.740* :  at the opportunity to travel.
*29:08.740- 29:11.840* :  We left our jobs to do it and we wanted an adventure.
*29:12.320- 29:16.580* :  And then when we got to East Timor and we waited to try and find a boat
*29:16.580- 29:19.600* :  across the truth is it was so late in the season
*29:19.820- 29:23.020* :  with the cyclone coming and basically we'd missed our chance
*29:23.020- 29:24.440* :  to hitch a lift on a yacht.
*29:24.880- 29:28.120* :  And in the end, after trying really hard at the docks three weeks,
*29:28.640- 29:31.780* :  trying to find sea captains and trying to ask shipping companies
*29:31.780- 29:34.840* :  and all the rest of it, we decided time was running out.
*29:34.840- 29:38.700* :  So we got the plane from Dilly across to Darwin.
*29:39.200- 29:41.420* :  And then we took Greyhound buses the rest of the way.
*29:41.420- 29:42.420* :  It's the very short flight.
*29:42.420- 29:43.700* :  It was Rose's first flight.
*29:43.700- 29:46.720* :  But we reckoned we're okay with it because the carbon footprint
*29:46.720- 29:49.160* :  was a lot less than if we'd flown from England.
*29:49.720- 29:53.280* :  The thing about traveling over landages is that you see the people
*29:53.280- 29:54.440* :  and the land change.
*29:54.840- 29:56.240* :  And yet at the end, you look back.
*29:56.260- 29:58.500* :  It just feels very much like we're one world.
*29:58.780- 29:59.600* :  How long did it take?
*29:59.780- 30:02.060* :  Almost exactly four months to reach Sydney.
*30:02.380- 30:03.600* :  You know what I'm going to ask.
*30:04.340- 30:05.240* :  How are you getting back?
*30:07.380- 30:10.220* :  The reason we're so delighted to be speaking to you today.
*30:10.220- 30:12.680* :  So we're looking for someone who might give us a lift to be honest.
*30:13.760- 30:16.300* :  So if there's any of your listeners out there today,
*30:16.300- 30:18.980* :  you might want to sometime in March.
*30:19.260- 30:20.440* :  Yeah, sometime in March.
*30:20.500- 30:21.720* :  It was lift back on their boat.
*30:21.880- 30:24.440* :  They've got to be going by boat from Australia to Europe.
*30:24.820- 30:26.120* :  Yeah, two more is fine.
*30:26.300- 30:27.760* :  Yeah, then we'll come the same group.
*30:27.880- 30:30.200* :  We're really happy to come back to China and that.
*30:30.260- 30:33.160* :  But we just want to get across the water without flying if we can.
*30:33.960- 30:37.020* :  Shannon Coggins, Theo Simon and their daughter Rosa
*30:37.500- 30:38.580* :  speaking to James Reynolds.
*30:41.600- 30:42.920* :  And that's all from us for now.
*30:42.920- 30:45.900* :  But there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*30:46.300- 30:49.420* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*30:49.420- 30:50.700* :  you can send us an email.
*30:50.700- 30:54.880* :  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
*30:54.880- 30:59.240* :  You can also find us on X, formerly known as Twitter at Global News Pod.
*30:59.240- 31:02.660* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and the producer
*31:02.660- 31:03.700* :  was Emma Joseph.
*31:04.220- 31:05.800* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*31:06.080- 31:06.920* :  I'm Rachel Wright.
*31:07.140- 31:08.680* :  Until next time, goodbye.
