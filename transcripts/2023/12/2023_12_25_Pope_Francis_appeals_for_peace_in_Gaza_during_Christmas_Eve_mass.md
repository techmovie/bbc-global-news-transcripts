*01:46.400- 01:50.360* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:52.420- 01:57.500* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Monday, the 25th of December, these are our main
*01:57.500- 02:03.740* :  stories. At his Christmas Eve Mass Pope Francis appealed for peace as dozens of reported killed
*02:03.740- 02:10.260* :  at a refugee camp in Gaza in the latest Israeli air strike. In Serbia, demonstrations which turned
*02:10.260- 02:15.740* :  violent are broken up by the police. They followed last week's elections, which the opposition says
*02:15.740- 02:23.140* :  were marred by fraud. The British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe is buying a 25% stake in Manchester United
*02:23.140- 02:28.680* :  Football Club at a cost of 1.6 billion dollars. Also in this podcast,
*02:36.940- 02:42.740* :  90 years after it was written, the Christmas Carol performed in its hometown of Barnsley
*02:43.140- 02:44.020* :  in the north of England.
*02:48.000- 02:53.280* :  As the war in Gaza continues, celebrations for the Christian festival of Christmas have been
*02:53.280- 02:59.000* :  cancelled in Bethlehem in the West Bank. It's the city, according to the Bible, where Jesus Christ
*02:59.000- 03:05.220* :  was born more than 2,000 years ago, and it's a place usually filled with music and carols in
*03:05.220- 03:11.540* :  December. But this year, there's no tree lighting up manger square and the evangelical Lutheran
*03:11.540- 03:17.320* :  Christmas Church has built its manger from rubble. It's pastor, Wooddee Isaac, taught us why.
*03:41.500- 03:48.580* :  Of Christmas, our children are under the rubble, our homes are destroyed, and we see a strong
*03:48.580- 03:54.600* :  connection. At the Vatican on Sunday night, Pope Francis appealed for peace in the Middle East,
*03:54.860- 04:00.960* :  as he presided over a solemn Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. He spoke about the war
*04:01.260- 04:02.880* :  between Israel and Hamas.
*04:11.340- 04:19.600* :  It's once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today
*04:20.480- 04:24.220* :  prevents him from finding room in the world.
*04:25.400- 04:30.800* :  Meanwhile, Israel is showing no signs of halting its operations in Gaza, as one of its
*04:30.800- 04:32.740* :  spokesman Ilanivi told the BBC.
*04:33.440- 04:37.620* :  Our policy now is to continue putting unrelenting military pressure on Hamas,
*04:37.800- 04:42.180* :  because standing by the sidelines was never an option. We are creating the conditions.
*04:42.740- 04:47.420* :  For Hamas to be willing to release the hostages, it has brutally abducted and is holding
*04:47.420- 04:53.440* :  without any access to the Red Cross in flagrant violation of humanitarian law and every norm of
*04:53.440- 04:57.020* :  human decency for those vulnerable hostages trapped in those terror dungeons.
*04:57.860- 05:01.240* :  A correspondent Shima Khalil traveled to Bethlehem.
*05:07.020- 05:11.180* :  On days like this, Joe Ditt and his father Hanna would have been talking about Christmas
*05:12.100- 05:16.920* :  preparations, but not this year. Joe Ditt's family is trapped in Northern Gaza.
*05:17.500- 05:23.080* :  Communication has been impossible at times, so he's holding on to this patchy video call to
*05:23.080- 05:28.720* :  get a glimpse of his father and to reassure him that they'll be together again, but his dad
*05:28.720- 05:31.520* :  has overcome with grief and visibly emotional.
*05:34.660- 05:39.040* :  A week ago, Joe Ditt's grandmother, Nahida, was shot twice in the stomach. His aunt
*05:39.040- 05:43.800* :  summer rushed to help her and was shot in the head. He shows me pictures of the immediate
*05:44.140- 05:48.840* :  aftermath and then the funeral. His parents and relatives had been sheltering in the holy
*05:48.840- 05:55.000* :  family church. Now they've buried their loved ones there. The family blames Israeli snipers for
*05:55.000- 06:01.560* :  their death. The IDF says it will continue its investigation. Joe Ditt's dad is in tears as he
*06:01.560- 06:10.280* :  remembers that day. It was a shock. It happened before our eyes. It was unbearable. I'm sorry,
*06:10.280- 06:14.940* :  I can hardly speak, but it's just so difficult we've endured so much.
*06:17.500- 06:22.120* :  There's no safety, there's still shelling around us. I don't know if you can hear it.
*06:22.520- 06:29.700* :  Yes, yes, we can hear it. Samain. Samain. Before he says goodbye, he has a message for Joe Ditt.
*06:31.700- 06:34.460* :  May God be with you, my son. Take care of your sisters.
*06:37.960- 06:43.040* :  The war in Gaza weighs heavily on Bethlehem. Visitors from around the world would have been here
*06:43.040- 06:49.220* :  by now, but Christmas celebrations have been cancelled this year. It's empty. The city is empty
*06:49.560- 06:57.300* :  from happiness, from joy, from kids, from Santa, from every celebration. There's no celebration
*06:57.300- 07:02.540* :  this year. We cannot celebrate Christmas because we are not in another side of the world we are
*07:02.540- 07:11.400* :  like in a stolen ball of time. It's so difficult. We're really struggling. Look at Bethlehem.
*07:11.400- 07:18.960* :  It's never been this way. In an unusually empty nativity church,
*07:19.600- 07:23.280* :  Father Isat al-Jeeh tells me his city feels like a shadow of itself.
*07:24.100- 07:28.000* :  Well, if you're here as a priest of this church and I was born in Bethlehem, I never actually
*07:28.000- 07:33.420* :  seen like this. We have also brothers and sisters in Gaza's and this is what exactly makes it
*07:33.420- 07:39.520* :  difficult also to celebrate and to have maybe to be united with prayer. In major square
*07:39.520- 07:45.600* :  in ativities seen in the rubble has replaced the giant Christmas tree, a tribute to the children in
*07:45.600- 07:55.080* :  Gaza and a call to end their suffering. Shima Khalil in Bethlehem. Next to Serbia and to the capital
*07:55.080- 08:00.420* :  Belgrade. Demonstrations took place on Sunday outside Serbia's election commission building
*08:00.860- 08:01.900* :  and at the city hall.
*08:10.220- 08:13.980* :  Police used tear gas as some protesters tried to storm the city hall.
*08:13.980- 08:20.100* :  Windows were broken at the entrance of the building. The protesters shouted open the door and thieves.
*08:20.220- 08:25.420* :  They'd gathered to call for a rerun of last week's parliamentary and local elections.
*08:25.500- 08:31.680* :  Both domestic and international observers have condemned what they called serious irregularities,
*08:31.680- 08:37.880* :  including the stuffing of ballot boxes and votes being bought. I spoke to our Balkans correspondent
*08:37.880- 08:42.560* :  Guide Lonnie and asked him how the demonstration was eventually broken up.
*08:42.780- 08:48.320* :  Now the opposition are saying that police used excessive force to break up their protest when
*08:48.320- 08:54.420* :  it was in front of Belgrade city hall. One member of parliament, the green left front co-lead
*08:54.420- 08:59.900* :  of Radamiya Lazavic, said officers beat him and another of other people with trunctions,
*09:00.440- 09:05.680* :  and he said the police also used tear gas and pepper spray. It's quite interesting that you
*09:05.680- 09:10.620* :  mention these attempts to get into the city hall and the windows being smashed, Valerie,
*09:10.980- 09:16.000* :  because again the opposition activists, particularly the students who've been involved in these
*09:16.000- 09:22.580* :  protests every evening, since last week's elections, say they weren't involved in those attempts
*09:22.580- 09:28.980* :  and they believe there were some Ajahn Provokater who were involved, who were there to make their
*09:28.980- 09:36.180* :  protests look violent and for the opposition to look bad. It's a tangled tale which has yet
*09:36.180- 09:42.380* :  to be fully unwound. And have the police made arrests? The reports of a small number of arrests,
*09:42.380- 09:47.840* :  but we're not talking about anything more than single figures at the moment. In terms of the
*09:47.840- 09:53.580* :  numbers of people who were there, the authorities are talking about somewhere around 1100 people.
*09:53.580- 09:59.860* :  There's an analyst who regularly assesses the numbers of protests in Belgrade, who's
*10:00.080- 10:05.680* :  reasonably independent. He puts the number around 7,000 people. So it's a significant number
*10:05.680- 10:11.880* :  of people, but it's not exactly a mass movement. Nonetheless, it's been very persistent what's
*10:11.880- 10:17.860* :  been happening in Belgrade over the past week. People particularly angry about what happened
*10:17.900- 10:23.200* :  in the Belgrade City election, which was very much a target for the opposition, that they wanted to
*10:23.200- 10:29.120* :  build on winning Belgrade City Council. That was their aim, that they could then build a platform
*10:29.120- 10:34.240* :  to challenge the governing progressive party. The vote ended up being very close and they're saying
*10:34.240- 10:40.060* :  that these bust-in voters that they came into the city and voted for the progressive party
*10:40.260- 10:44.360* :  could have made all the difference, and that's why they're asking for a rerun of the election in
*10:44.360- 10:49.360* :  Belgrade. There's going to be a partial rerun though, isn't there? Very, very partial. We're talking
*10:49.360- 10:55.060* :  about three polling stations in the city, which the Belgrade Election Committee have decided to
*10:55.060- 11:00.500* :  rerun next Saturday. That's not going to affect the overall result, because at the moment you've
*11:00.500- 11:07.100* :  got the progressive party, 39%, the main opposition coalition, 35%. So that's not going to make a big
*11:07.100- 11:12.120* :  difference. So unless the government makes some sort of concessions, you can expect these protests
*11:12.220- 11:19.820* :  to continue and intensify. Guida Lonnie. The Chinese capital Beijing has experienced its coldest
*11:19.820- 11:26.700* :  December since records began in 1951. The city endured nine consecutive days with temperatures
*11:26.700- 11:33.300* :  lower than minus 10 degrees Celsius. Mickey Buster reports. It's been a year of extremes in the
*11:33.300- 11:39.680* :  Chinese capital. Six months ago, Beijing recorded its hottest ever, June day, just over 40 degrees
*11:39.680- 11:45.960* :  Celsius. It's currently in June. It's coldest December on record, with temperatures frequently
*11:45.960- 11:52.420* :  falling below minus 10. China has been hit with several waves of extremely cold weather. Already
*11:52.420- 11:58.440* :  this winter, parts of northern Japan have seen huge snowfall, and South Korea has been battling
*11:58.440- 12:03.180* :  freezing temperatures. It's not clear how people are coping in North Korea.
*12:03.880- 12:09.660* :  Michael Bristo. Manchester United is one of the biggest names in World Football and one of the
*12:09.660- 12:15.420* :  wealthiest clubs. It was the home of David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. Among its current highly
*12:15.420- 12:21.900* :  paid players is Marcus Rashford. But its glory days seem to be disappearing. It's been a decade since
*12:21.900- 12:26.920* :  Manchester United, owned by the American Glazer family, were last champions of England.
*12:27.020- 12:33.180* :  So many fans will be delighted by news that the British businessman billionaire Jim Radcliffe
*12:33.400- 12:40.340* :  is buying a 25% stake in the club for around 1.6 billion dollars. I heard more about the deal
*12:40.340- 12:45.120* :  from our sports correspondent, Nestor McGregor. Christmas has come early for some mentors
*12:45.120- 12:48.380* :  to United fans, unless you're in a part of the world where it's already gone midnight.
*12:48.380- 12:53.400* :  After 13 long months of negotiations, Sir Jim Radcliffe, a lifelong Manchester United fan
*12:53.400- 12:59.940* :  is now a part owner of the team, but there is a big but. Whilst Manchester United and Sir Jim Radcliffe
*12:59.940- 13:03.880* :  have agreed on a deal, the Premier League still has to sign this off. He still has to go through
*13:03.880- 13:07.980* :  what they call a fit and proper owners and directors test. There are one of no things like,
*13:07.980- 13:13.840* :  has he got the money that he's promised and more importantly, where did it come from? Sir Jim Radcliffe
*13:13.840- 13:17.600* :  is one of the richest people in the UK and made his money from selling raw materials,
*13:17.600- 13:22.420* :  from packaging for toiletries, medicines, food, to even mobile phones and furniture. Most of
*13:22.420- 13:26.840* :  the things that we use today, he'll be in charge of footballing operations for the men's,
*13:26.840- 13:31.960* :  women's and academy teams at Manchester United as well as that 1.6 billion dollar investment you
*13:31.960- 13:37.520* :  mentioned. Immediately, there will be a 300 million dollar injection which will go into refurbishing
*13:37.520- 13:43.300* :  the famous but aging old traffic stadium. And if it all goes ahead, I mean, how much power would
*13:43.300- 13:47.300* :  it give him? Will he choose players? Will he choose managers? That's what people want to know.
*13:47.480- 13:52.180* :  Yeah, and the truth is, cliche or not, we'll just have to wait and see because Valerie, this
*13:52.180- 13:57.200* :  deal isn't like anything we've seen before. Think about it, a minority owner being in charge of
*13:57.200- 14:01.700* :  running the football side of the club. So like you say, that does mean potentially the buying and
*14:01.700- 14:07.240* :  selling of players and the hiring and firing of managers. But with the American family, the glazes
*14:07.240- 14:14.480* :  who bought the club in 2005, still in total overall control. If the pair disagree on any deals,
*14:14.480- 14:19.020* :  surely behind the scenes that can get messy, lawyers might get involved. And do you think on any
*14:19.020- 14:23.800* :  major, major decisions? So Jim might be outvoted as well. But I think any United fan unhappy with the
*14:23.800- 14:30.320* :  way the glazes have been running the club will be happy that they have a fan on the board. And that
*14:30.320- 14:35.240* :  is the first step towards changing at the top. Because Nestor, putting it in context, Manu has not
*14:35.240- 14:41.160* :  been doing well. Has it? Maybe an understatement Manchester United, you know, was once all conquering.
*14:41.400- 14:45.860* :  But Valerie, this is the worst start to a league in 90 years. They're eighth in the Premier League.
*14:46.240- 14:50.780* :  Remember, they're already out of European competition. And on and off the field, there has been
*14:50.780- 14:56.500* :  turmoil with player in discipline at the revolving door of managers. So yeah, real, real turmoil. But
*14:56.500- 15:02.360* :  many people say, see this deal. If it goes ahead as a real, real change in the right direction.
*15:02.740- 15:10.240* :  Nestor McGregor. And before we move on in an earlier podcast, we mentioned a story about a new
*15:10.240- 15:16.320* :  NASA spacecraft, the Europa Clipper. We just want to point out that the poem to be engraved on
*15:16.320- 15:21.640* :  the side of the craft was a NASA commission for the Europa mission. The BBC obtained permission
*15:21.680- 15:27.700* :  to use it. The reading on the BBC was commissioned by Nicola Fox, who works for NASA.

*17:15.700- 17:19.940* :  It's now five days since the election, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
*17:20.420- 17:24.680* :  and the official results of the country's presidential election are still to be announced.
*17:25.320- 17:30.280* :  But one of the main opposition candidates is already crying foul, calling for the vote to be
*17:30.280- 17:35.340* :  annulled. Where you see Kutumbi has demanded a fresh election, saying his evidence of
*17:35.340- 17:41.780* :  government officials stuffing ballot boxes. He urged people in the DRC to challenge the election result.
*17:42.260- 17:46.900* :  You are calling the people to defend their vote because they know what they voted,
*17:46.900- 17:52.440* :  and they have to protect what they vote for it. The election has to be canceled. Can you tell me
*17:52.440- 17:56.880* :  in which country where they can vote for three days? In this all three days of watching.
*17:57.320- 18:01.340* :  So we need these things to bring peace. We need to have the real election.
*18:01.680- 18:06.540* :  But in an interview with the BBC, the head of the Independent National Electoral Commission,
*18:06.540- 18:12.000* :  Dennis Kedema, projected those allegations. People always want democracy,
*18:12.000- 18:18.280* :  but only when they win themselves. But the reality is everything that you see is the truth,
*18:18.280- 18:23.380* :  a reflection of the will of the people. The voting took place in full view of observers,
*18:23.380- 18:30.080* :  South Africa, Belgium, France, Canada and the US. It was well-conducted. It was democratic.
*18:30.080- 18:35.140* :  They have not been any instance of manipulation of what's over.
*18:35.960- 18:42.280* :  The DRC is the second largest country in Africa with 44 million eligible voters.
*18:43.020- 18:47.380* :  A reporter in the Capitol can Chasse, Emory Macameno, told us about the challenges
*18:47.380- 18:55.440* :  of holding an election in the vast country. The DRC is as big as four times the size of France,
*18:55.860- 19:02.140* :  with very huge deficit of infrastructure. The 26 provinces can barely be connected by roads
*19:02.140- 19:08.940* :  or any form of basic infrastructure. So for these elections here, the budget given by Mr. Kattunbi
*19:08.940- 19:18.820* :  there was over a billion dollars. And this money was to be used to reach at least 75,000 polling
*19:18.820- 19:25.160* :  stations in some remote areas where access is even impossible. You also have a plethora
*19:25.160- 19:33.220* :  of candidates more than 100,000 were registered as candidates to vote. So this is a lot of money
*19:33.220- 19:37.540* :  and a big challenge when it comes to infrastructure. Emory Macameno.
*19:38.280- 19:43.240* :  The authorities in Sri Lanka say criminal gangs are increasingly using the country as a hub
*19:43.240- 19:49.560* :  for smuggling illegal drugs, notably heroin and cocaine. In a drive against drug trafficking,
*19:49.560- 19:54.800* :  police have arrested thousands of people in the last week and seized hundreds of killings of
*19:54.800- 20:00.180* :  narcotics. A South Asia correspondent and Barassan Etherajan has been following the story.
*20:00.840- 20:05.180* :  It has been one of the biggest rates the country has carried out in recent years.
*20:05.180- 20:09.920* :  It has been going on for the last seven days. Hundreds of police officers,
*20:10.620- 20:15.840* :  paramilitary commandos and even the military were involved in these operations going on across
*20:15.840- 20:22.240* :  the country. And they were using sniffer dogs to search in different houses. And what the police
*20:22.240- 20:29.340* :  are saying is that they have taken into custody nearly 14,000 people. Many of them were suspect,
*20:29.340- 20:36.140* :  some of them were drug addicts. And they want to put an end, they want to control what they call
*20:36.140- 20:42.420* :  as growing menace of narcotics issues. They have also seized hundreds of kilograms of various
*20:42.420- 20:48.080* :  types of drugs including heroin. Now, why this is happening in Sri Lanka now? Because
*20:48.080- 20:54.340* :  Sri Lanka is also a tourist nation. And now Sri Lanka's port, especially Colombo,
*20:54.900- 21:02.240* :  is works as a trans shipment port for many countries like India. And many goods come from India,
*21:02.240- 21:07.440* :  they get a transcript to Singapore and other places. The strategic location right at the southern
*21:07.440- 21:13.540* :  tip of India, it gives for many people access to India. That was one of the reasons why Sri
*21:13.540- 21:19.760* :  Lanka was being used as a transit hub. And it also leads to many gang wars in the capital.
*21:19.760- 21:24.940* :  Colombo, in fact, there have been some shootouts. And even the Sri Lankan Navy was arresting a lot
*21:24.940- 21:29.860* :  of people in the mid-seize. But I'm not saying there has been criticism of this huge operation,
*21:29.920- 21:34.460* :  hasn't there? There have been a number of human rights activists who say that the ongoing operation
*21:34.460- 21:40.520* :  is first of all not legal because they did not have search warrant whenever they enter the house.
*21:40.660- 21:45.360* :  So the human rights lawyers, they say that none of these warrants were shown. So they were illegal.
*21:45.480- 21:49.940* :  The second aspect, if you look at what many people would say, is that most of these
*21:49.940- 21:56.060* :  raids were being carried out in down-trodden areas and underprivileged communities. So you are
*21:56.060- 22:01.080* :  targeting only a select group of people. And you are leaving out, you know, many of these
*22:01.080- 22:06.340* :  drags are available even in these high-end nightclubs and casinos in different places.
*22:06.900- 22:11.500* :  So they are not being touched. You are only focusing only on the lower end of the society.
*22:11.500- 22:16.400* :  And that is causing a lot of concern because these people do not have the ability to fight legal
*22:16.400- 22:23.960* :  cases and they are being stigmatized. And Barassana Etheragin, most of the 300 Indian nationals
*22:23.960- 22:29.320* :  who have been held at a French airport are to be released on Monday. Their flight was on its
*22:29.320- 22:33.940* :  way to Nicaragua, but was detained during a refueling stop. Here is Pommos.
*22:34.520- 22:39.920* :  It looks like they will soon be on their way, but where too? More than 300 Indian nationals were
*22:39.920- 22:45.140* :  on the chartered flight heading for Nicaragua, but then the French authorities received a tip-off
*22:45.140- 22:50.120* :  that were being trafficked with the United States as their final destination. The plane was held
*22:50.120- 22:55.200* :  at an airport near Paris, an investigative judges have spent Sunday questioning the passengers.
*22:55.880- 23:00.580* :  They have now said most can leave on Monday morning, but not whether the claims of trafficking
*23:00.580- 23:04.840* :  were true or whether the plane can continue its journey to Central America.
*23:05.920- 23:12.500* :  Pommos. Our sense of smell is the one was closely linked to memory and can conjure up
*23:12.500- 23:18.640* :  intense emotions. We asked colleagues here at the BBC to tell us but their favourite smells.
*23:19.460- 23:23.480* :  Early childhood in Wales, coming home from school to find the kitchen full of steam
*23:23.480- 23:33.080* :  and the smell of my mum's cow or Welsh stew. Beef, carrot, onion, bowl potatoes. Perfect for a cold day.
*23:33.580- 23:39.220* :  My abiding memory of smell is the smell of books. The crisp, fresh smell of a new paperback,
*23:39.220- 23:43.960* :  the yellowing pages of a low old hard bound classic, the musty order of nostalgia.
*23:44.760- 23:49.860* :  Books though are not for smelling, therefore reading. But whenever I open a book, I can't help
*23:49.860- 23:57.500* :  noticing how it smells. And no matter how it reads, each book with its printed paper has a distinctive
*23:57.500- 24:04.240* :  smell. Now a project called Ode Europa is using artificial intelligence to develop new
*24:04.300- 24:09.700* :  and unique ways of collecting information about smells to preserve for future generations.
*24:10.420- 24:13.700* :  We'll tell it, Professor of History at York University here in the UK,
*24:14.620- 24:20.400* :  researchers, sensory, embodied and environmental history. And Sean Lay, who was in the studio with
*24:20.400- 24:27.540* :  other guests, asked him to explain more about his project. Ode Europa is a project that really is
*24:27.540- 24:32.140* :  interested in trying to find lots and lots of references to smells in the past and then kind of
*24:32.140- 24:38.200* :  bring some of those smells back to the noses of people in the here and now. So what we were doing
*24:38.200- 24:44.200* :  was we were taking vast amounts of kind of digitized historical texts from the 1600s to 1920s,
*24:44.820- 24:49.660* :  looking for references to smells. Then we built a kind of whole encyclopedia where people can
*24:49.660- 24:53.800* :  begin to read about some of those and some of the stories about them. But we've also developed
*24:53.800- 24:58.440* :  new kind of tools for them bringing smells back into museums. So we've devised a historical
*24:58.440- 25:03.540* :  scent collection that's going to be deposited in the Osmo tech, which is the world's kind of main,
*25:03.580- 25:09.440* :  I guess, Museum of perfumes in Versailles. And a kind of toolkit that will help museums to get
*25:09.440- 25:15.080* :  smells back into into into their collections and to the to the noses of audiences. Professor Tullet,
*25:15.080- 25:19.340* :  I was just going to ask you to pick up on this idea that there's something different about the
*25:19.340- 25:26.020* :  sense of smell. I heard somebody say in an interview yesterday on the BBC that actually the sense
*25:26.020- 25:30.900* :  of smell goes somewhere different to where the other senses go in terms of how it is interpreted
*25:30.900- 25:35.340* :  by the brain. Is that right? Yeah, absolutely. Actually, I should start by saying that we're
*25:35.340- 25:39.100* :  kind of following the steps of Asia with this project because Japan was one of the first countries
*25:39.100- 25:45.540* :  to make a list of 100 protected, fragrant spaces that were voted for by the public. So Europe
*25:45.540- 25:50.520* :  is kind of following on the heels of other countries. But yes, I mean, smell has a kind of direct
*25:50.520- 25:56.140* :  connection to memory and emotion that many other senses don't possess. And it's for that reason
*25:56.140- 26:00.600* :  that we often associate smell, particularly with many of our childhood memories, actually.
*26:00.860- 26:04.880* :  One of the things that I was looking at was the smell of petrol. And for many people, they kind of
*26:04.880- 26:08.620* :  admit that, okay, this may not be a particularly good smell of the environment, but it's a really
*26:08.620- 26:12.580* :  nostalgic smell for them because it's connected to things like going on childhood holidays.
*26:13.240- 26:18.760* :  So it does have this ability to conjure up our own paths. What about this this idea you've got
*26:18.760- 26:24.340* :  of reviving some smells? Tell us a bit about that. Yeah, so we've done that in various ways.
*26:24.620- 26:29.780* :  One way we've route we've taken with Dr. Celia Ben-Beebray, who's at University College
*26:29.780- 26:35.280* :  London, is to actually use the methods of analytical chemistry. So we will use various devices to
*26:35.280- 26:41.740* :  capture the smells from objects or spaces. So we did a project at the British Motor Museum in
*26:41.740- 26:46.100* :  Gaden where we captured the smell of one of the Queen's Old Rover cars from the 1970s,
*26:46.220- 26:50.720* :  analysing in a lab, and then use the kind of chemical blueprint to recreate the scent. So we've
*26:50.720- 26:55.200* :  now got this kind of blueprint and a recreation of the smell we can preserve. But some of them
*26:55.200- 26:59.320* :  have been more sort of, essentially, say, interpretative and creative. So we did something with
*26:59.340- 27:06.680* :  perfumers where we recreated the smell of hell based on, based on, I mean, you could say we're
*27:06.680- 27:12.740* :  living in it, but it was based on the smell of hell as described by early modern, so 16th,
*27:12.780- 27:17.620* :  17th century sermons, who described it as smelling like a million dead dogs, for example.
*27:18.680- 27:21.660* :  And so we said to a perfumer, well, how do we create something that offensive?
*27:24.200- 27:29.120* :  Fascinating stuff from Will Tullet from York University here in England.
*27:30.640- 27:37.060* :  And finally, a Christmas Carol lost for nearly a century has been sung again by a full choir
*27:37.060- 27:41.880* :  in a Yorkshire town in the north of England, where it was originally written. The composition
*27:41.880- 27:47.640* :  was recently rediscovered by museum archivists in Barnsley. Adam Coacher reports.
*27:52.520- 27:56.620* :  Written by factory worker for the opening of Barnsley Town Hall in 1933,
*27:57.440- 28:01.840* :  lyrics and sheet music for the song titled Christmas Eve were published in the local paper.
*28:02.560- 28:06.900* :  Fast forward to this year and after Godfrey's work was rediscovered in an old copy of the
*28:06.900- 28:11.800* :  Barnsley Chronicle by staff at the Towns Museum, who decided to record a version of the song for
*28:11.800- 28:16.440* :  their Christmas celebrations. Dr. Tagwin Roberts was the voice behind the museum's recording.
*28:16.900- 28:22.420* :  Fritz have gone viral and ran the world is incredible. We've had community choirs that want to
*28:22.460- 28:27.320* :  sing it, the Barnsley music, hope have created a brass version for us. It's just the overwhelming
*28:27.320- 28:33.440* :  is probably the word. According to the 1921 census, after Godfrey was married with seven children,
*28:34.100- 28:36.280* :  the search is now on for any living descendants.
*28:45.500- 28:46.760* :  Adam Coacher reporting.
