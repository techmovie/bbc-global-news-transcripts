*01:36.900- 01:40.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:43.040- 01:48.460* :  I'm Rachel Wright, and in the early hours of Saturday the 16th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:48.460- 01:53.260* :  The Israeli military has expressed deep remorse over the deaths of three hostages
*01:53.260- 01:58.360* :  held by Hamas and Gaza, who were killed after being mistakenly identified as a threat.
*01:58.460- 02:04.220* :  The Global Shipping Giant Merch says it's suspending container traffic through the Red Sea
*02:04.580- 02:07.340* :  after a spate of attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen.
*02:08.020- 02:12.600* :  And the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that age-old hatreds
*02:12.900- 02:15.320* :  were resurfacing around the world with a vengeance.
*02:18.460- 02:25.100* :  Also in this podcast, President Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is ordered to pay $148
*02:25.100- 02:28.640* :  million, and the Italians are up in arms.
*02:32.300- 02:36.180* :  These people should be locked up. Locked up. It seems crazy to me.
*02:36.460- 02:38.560* :  It seems to distort what is traditional.
*02:42.220- 02:46.740* :  The Israeli military says it has killed three hostages who were being held in Gaza
*02:46.740- 02:51.720* :  after they were mistakenly identified as a threat in a town in the north of the Gaza Strip.
*02:52.280- 02:58.400* :  The victims have been named as Yotam Hame and Seymour Talalka, both were abducted by Hamas
*02:58.400- 03:03.680* :  from Kaputsas in southern Israel. The family of the third hostage had initially requested that
*03:03.680- 03:09.480* :  his name was not broadcast. Christian Fraser spoke to Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conriccus
*03:09.520- 03:14.160* :  from the Israel Defense Forces and asked him about the military operation in Gaza.
*03:15.020- 03:21.800* :  What I can add to your correct description of the very sad and tragic event is that the third
*03:21.820- 03:28.900* :  hostage that was mistakenly killed by Israeli troops has been, his name has been approved
*03:28.900- 03:37.500* :  for public release. He was Alon Shamriz from Kfar Azah, who was also abducted on the seventh of
*03:37.500- 03:44.220* :  October, and his family has of course been notified and they have approved the release of his name
*03:44.220- 03:51.280* :  and of course the idea has expressed our deepest regret towards the families of those fallen
*03:51.280- 03:58.600* :  Israeli hostages. We are investigating the matter. We have already issued lessons and directives
*03:58.780- 04:03.240* :  for our troops on the ground in order to minimize the chances of this happening again.
*04:03.240- 04:10.040* :  And of course we will continue to operate relentlessly in order to defeat Hamas despite this
*04:10.420- 04:15.920* :  horrible and sad event and we will not be deterred or delayed and we will continue to fight Hamas
*04:15.920- 04:19.780* :  until it is defeated and until security is returned to southern Israel.
*04:19.960- 04:23.220* :  I'm sure that the details around it will be subject to an inquiry.
*04:23.220- 04:28.380* :  Is there any further information you can give us to why they were mistaken for Hamas fighters?
*04:28.380- 04:32.560* :  Were they in the vicinity of Hamas fighters? Were they dressed in a Palestinian way?
*04:32.560- 04:36.480* :  Was there any other explanation for why they were shot and killed?
*04:37.020- 04:44.100* :  Yes, one of them is actually two. One relates to the clothing. They were dressed in civilian clothing
*04:44.780- 04:49.960* :  and probably in a similar fashion to what we have seen Hamas combatants.
*04:50.540- 04:55.440* :  Hamas fighters or terrorists that have been fighting on the ground against Israeli troops
*04:55.440- 05:00.220* :  all over the Gaza Strip in Sanjayia where this happened and in other locations as well.
*05:00.220- 05:06.900* :  We have seen Hamas fighters with RPG grenade launchers in their hands and AK-47s and IEDs
*05:06.900- 05:12.940* :  dressed in civilian clothes and that adds complexity to the situational awareness of our troops.
*05:12.940- 05:19.440* :  And the second thing is that before and after this tragic mistake occurred,
*05:19.440- 05:27.060* :  there were clashes between Israeli troops in the area and Hamas combatants and that apparently
*05:27.060- 05:31.000* :  was also part of the reasons for this very sad mistake.
*05:31.660- 05:36.260* :  Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conriccus, a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces.
*05:36.780- 05:40.260* :  The bodies of the Israeli hostages have now been returned to Israel.
*05:41.180- 05:45.740* :  Israel has announced it will open a new route for humanitarian assistance to enter Gaza.
*05:45.900- 05:51.240* :  This will be the first time since October 7th that supplies will be allowed to enter from Israeli
*05:51.240- 05:56.780* :  territory. There's a desperate need for food, water and medicine in Gaza, but delivering
*05:56.780- 06:03.300* :  that aid can be dangerous work. The United Nations Agency, Anra, alone has said at least 135
*06:03.300- 06:08.500* :  of its staff have been killed since the war began. A member of another UN body,
*06:08.500- 06:13.080* :  Ocha, has described the experience of carrying aid through an Israeli checkpoint.
*06:13.080- 06:17.980* :  With the details, here's our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, who's in Jerusalem.
*06:18.780- 06:25.020* :  I've been talking to a British aid worker who took part in a joint UN-WHO convoy,
*06:25.020- 06:31.100* :  accompanying Palestinian medics, making a very high-risk journey from the south of Gaza,
*06:31.100- 06:37.000* :  from Rafa, up to the Alahli hospital in the north. And to do that, they had to cross the checkpoint
*06:37.000- 06:41.620* :  of Wadi Gaza, which is roughly halfway down the Gaza Strip. And it's the first time
*06:41.620- 06:47.500* :  certainly that I've heard a first hand account from somebody of what it's like to run the gauntlet
*06:48.040- 06:54.380* :  of not only checkpoints, but airstrikes and debris and unexploded bombs on the side of the road,
*06:55.020- 07:00.560* :  and the appalling conditions that were found inside that hospital of bodies and wounded lying
*07:00.560- 07:05.440* :  side by side. So his account is fairly graphic, and this is what he told me. He's called Jake
*07:05.440- 07:11.880* :  Mauland from the OCA. We were crossing what is now a front line at what they call Wadi Gaza.
*07:12.420- 07:18.680* :  It's an Israeli checkpoint, and we had to get through there with Palestinian colleagues. We
*07:18.680- 07:24.360* :  were held there for well over an hour, while the Palestinian paramedics were forced out of their
*07:24.360- 07:31.380* :  cars, forced to stand in an extremely exposed area at huge risk to themselves, while they were
*07:31.380- 07:38.500* :  profiled by these soldiers. And indeed, two of them were led away where we understand one was
*07:38.500- 07:45.300* :  put on his knees, stripped, and detained for some time until we were able to negotiate his release
*07:45.300- 07:50.520* :  and carry on to Gaza City to do the job we were there to do. You mentioned that one of the
*07:50.520- 07:57.060* :  vehicles were shot at. We saw not only unexploded ordinances on the road and on the sides of the
*07:57.060- 08:02.420* :  road making the trip all the more perilous, but we were also shot at. The ambulance took a
*08:02.420- 08:09.260* :  couple of bullets as indeed did our truck. So it really was putting humanitarian workers' lives
*08:09.260- 08:17.120* :  on the line as they went to try and save lives. What happened on the way back? We were focused on the
*08:17.120- 08:25.940* :  19 critically injured patients. All of these patients had life-critical injuries, amputations,
*08:25.940- 08:33.120* :  horrific wounds that needed immediate attention. We were held for over two hours at the checkpoint.
*08:33.120- 08:40.520* :  The walking wounded were forced at gunpoint from the ambulance and again were stood in the sand
*08:41.220- 08:48.960* :  to be profiled by the IDF. Even the children who were wounded and terrified, I must say,
*08:48.960- 08:55.780* :  were carried out by the paramedics and stood there for over an hour while pictures were taken and
*08:55.780- 09:02.360* :  while those who would have been led away were questioned. We understand stripped naked again at
*09:02.360- 09:10.240* :  gunpoint. But this was presumably after dark in the cold? He was still detained, but we had patients
*09:10.240- 09:16.980* :  who were literally dying because of all the delays that were being imposed on us. One of the patients
*09:16.980- 09:24.520* :  died from his injuries on the way to a hospital in the south. A death that we think may have been
*09:24.520- 09:28.700* :  avoidable had we been allowed free and fair access through the checkpoint.
*09:29.460- 09:34.560* :  UN aid worker Jake Mauland speaking to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner.
*09:34.880- 09:40.140* :  The BBC have asked the Israeli military for a response to this story, but are yet to receive one.
*09:41.360- 09:47.120* :  One of the world's biggest logistics companies, Merck, says it's pausing all container shipments
*09:47.120- 09:52.880* :  through the Red Sea until further notice. The decision comes after a series of attacks on merchant
*09:52.880- 09:59.280* :  vessels by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who say their targeting ships traveling to Israel.
*09:59.820- 10:05.140* :  On Friday, a vessel belonging to another shipping line was damaged after being struck off the Yemeni
*10:05.140- 10:11.880* :  coast. Merck said one of its ships narrowly escaped being hit on Thursday. Anita Anand spoke to
*10:11.880- 10:16.980* :  Michael Scott Moore, who is an author and journalist. He was captured by Somali pirates when
*10:16.980- 10:22.400* :  reporting on piracy in 2012. It's incredible. The amount of attacks in the last, just in the
*10:22.400- 10:27.760* :  last 48 hours. It's a strategic stretch of water that the Houthis have been taking advantage of
*10:27.760- 10:34.040* :  since the war started in Israel and the Gaza Strip. And it's a little bit odd that Somali pirates
*10:34.040- 10:40.320* :  seem to be piling in. Let's separate this. So the Houthis are politicized, extreme group based in
*10:40.320- 10:44.860* :  Yemen. But the Somali pirates are they at all politicized or they're just opportunists saying,
*10:44.980- 10:48.500* :  okay, well hey, you know, the Houthis are now, because they're firing rockets at ships,
*10:48.500- 10:51.500* :  this place is turned into the Wild West and we can carry on where we left off.
*10:51.780- 10:57.320* :  Well, it's not clear. Certainly the Houthis are sponsored by Iran and are trying to involve
*10:57.320- 11:03.260* :  themselves in the war on the side of Hamas against Israel. The Somali pirates to the extent that
*11:03.260- 11:07.300* :  they're involved are probably just being opportunistic. Yeah. There was a hijacking about a week ago
*11:07.300- 11:14.780* :  that seemed to involve five Somali pirates and that ship reportedly was steered back towards Yemen.
*11:14.780- 11:20.420* :  And if that's true, then that would be the first time anyone has heard of Somali pirates actually
*11:20.420- 11:25.400* :  working on behalf of the Houthis. But today it sounds like Somali pirates have actually captured
*11:25.400- 11:28.620* :  another ship and are steering it towards Somalia. So that would just be opportunistic.
*11:28.840- 11:32.580* :  Has the Red Sea always been vulnerable? And now people are just taking advantage of
*11:32.580- 11:38.220* :  loopholes that have always existed or has it all of a sudden become very much more vulnerable?
*11:38.680- 11:42.880* :  No, it's always been vulnerable simply because it's major narrowing of all the shipping lands
*11:42.880- 11:48.520* :  towards the Suez Canal. You have to everyone has to go around the Horn of Africa if they want to go
*11:49.120- 11:53.140* :  up into the Mediterranean from the Indian Ocean. They have to pass through the Red Sea and then in
*11:53.140- 11:58.500* :  the other direction too. So the Somali pirates when they started to catch large ships were also
*11:58.940- 12:03.900* :  being opportunistic about simply about their location. 300 years ago it was European pirates.
*12:04.040- 12:08.320* :  You know, it was American colonists pirates going out to that part of the world to take advantage
*12:08.320- 12:12.720* :  of the same straight. I mean, I sort of mentioned very briefly that you know what it's like. I mean,
*12:12.720- 12:18.300* :  just just remind people what you went through. I went to Somalia in 2012 after I covered a
*12:18.300- 12:25.780* :  trial of 10 Somali pirates in Germany. I was working for Spiegel online and on a private reporting
*12:25.780- 12:31.080* :  trip to rate more about that trial. I went to the central Somalia and I got kidnapped on land.
*12:31.160- 12:35.800* :  But it was a pirate gang that kidnapped me and within a few months they put me on board a ship
*12:35.800- 12:41.480* :  they had hijacked. So I lived on a ship for about six months too. The author Michael Scott Moore.
*12:42.380- 12:47.560* :  A jury in the United States has ordered Donald Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pay
*12:47.560- 12:54.460* :  148 million dollars in damages to two election workers he falsely accused of vote tempering
*12:54.460- 13:00.860* :  during the 2020 election in Georgia. A key battleground state in Mr. Trump's bid for re-election.
*13:00.860- 13:06.380* :  Nomiya Ikbal has more details. A judge already ruled Rudy Giuliani
*13:06.380- 13:11.500* :  spread false information about mother and daughter Ruby Freeman and Shay Moss. During the civil
*13:11.500- 13:15.660* :  trial they're both described how their lives had been impacted after December 2020.
*13:15.660- 13:20.880* :  When Mr. Giuliani first suggested that they had engaged in election fraud to turn the result
*13:20.880- 13:27.240* :  against Donald Trump in Georgia a critical swing state. The women said they were subjected to racist
*13:27.240- 13:32.400* :  and threatening messages and phone calls with people calling for them to be lynched and even
*13:32.400- 13:38.240* :  Miss Moss's teenage son was targeted. Rudy Giuliani did not testify at the trial but his lawyer
*13:38.240- 13:44.080* :  said he should not be held responsible for the abuse directed to the women. It's not known if Mr.
*13:44.080- 13:48.240* :  Giuliani can actually pay the amount because he hasn't disclosed his net worth.
*13:50.740- 13:55.420* :  In London the High Court has ruled that Prince Harry, King Charles's youngest son,
*13:55.420- 14:01.440* :  was the victim of phone hacking by a major newspaper group. The court said it found evidence of
*14:01.440- 14:06.560* :  the widespread and habitual use of phone hacking at the Mirror Group newspapers. Prince Harry
*14:06.560- 14:11.640* :  described it as a great day for truth and accountability. He was awarded the equivalent
*14:11.640- 14:18.800* :  of $185,000 in damages. Prince Harry's lawyer David Sherborn read a statement from outside
*14:18.800- 14:26.260* :  the court. Today's ruling is vindicating and affirming. I've been told that slaying dragons will
*14:26.260- 14:32.480* :  get you burned but in light of today's victory and the importance of doing what is needed for a
*14:32.480- 14:38.200* :  free and honest press it is a worthwhile price to pay. The mission continues.
*14:38.800- 14:43.980* :  The court ruling could have significant implications for the wider media industry in the UK.
*14:44.580- 14:49.900* :  However, as our royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell reports, taking on the British press has
*14:49.900- 14:55.540* :  been a high risk strategy for Prince Harry. Today's decision is a notable victory for Prince Harry.
*14:55.540- 15:00.280* :  It will be seen as a vindication of the stand he's taken against branches of the British media.
*15:00.920- 15:06.060* :  The intrusions, particularly when he was a child, scarred him, more so than in the case of other
*15:06.060- 15:11.260* :  members of his family, who've generally been able to move on. But in Harry's case, the sense
*15:11.260- 15:16.780* :  that he's on a mission to reveal past Mr Meena's by British tabloid newspapers has been driving him
*15:16.780- 15:22.460* :  for years. The fact that he has both the financial means and the distance from the day-to-day work
*15:22.460- 15:27.280* :  of the royal family has made it possible for him to pursue this and other court actions.
*15:28.120- 15:32.860* :  How will other members of his family be feeling when imagines that privately they'll be pleased
*15:32.860- 15:37.700* :  that one member of the family has taken on a branch of the British tabloid media, albeit for
*15:37.700- 15:44.260* :  activities in the past and one? However, it's unlikely to mitigate the feelings of deep disappointment
*15:44.260- 15:50.420* :  felt by the family at the behaviour of the Sussexes and their tendency to make public their many
*15:50.420- 15:58.560* :  complaints about the way they believe they've been treated. Nicholas Witchell. Still to come.

*16:11.580- 16:23.900* :  to decriminalise the production of cannabis. Our world is changing and with change comes new
*16:23.900- 16:29.520* :  challenges from rising sea levels to coastal erosion to extreme weather. Communities,

*17:50.320- 17:55.140* :  that you created. They will have to be some kind of negotiation to end this war.

*18:00.020- 18:05.820* :  Welcome back to the Global News podcast. The UN's World Food Program is warning that a humanitarian
*18:05.820- 18:11.700* :  crisis in Sudan is worsening as fighting between the paramilitary rapid support forces
*18:11.700- 18:18.280* :  and the Sudanese army intensifies south of the capital, Khartoum. Lenny Kensley is the World Food
*18:18.280- 18:26.000* :  Program spokesman for Sudan. Today, we mark a grim milestone. Eight months since a horrific war
*18:26.000- 18:32.300* :  erupted across Sudan, which is showing no sign of abating. That's eight months of terror,
*18:32.300- 18:37.960* :  violence, displacement and is measurable suffering, that the Sudanese people have had to endure
*18:38.520- 18:42.360* :  in what is becoming one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
*18:43.320- 18:46.700* :  For more on the background to the fighting, I've been talking to a correspondent
*18:46.700- 18:52.640* :  Calcadin Yipotal, who's in Addis Ababa. The fighting is between two armed groups, the Sudanese
*18:52.640- 18:59.620* :  army forces and the rapid support forces, a paramilitary group. Now, these two armed groups were
*19:00.360- 19:07.340* :  allies and they were governing the country in collaboration after overthrowing a civilian government
*19:07.340- 19:13.480* :  that followed the outsting of a long-time dictator in the country. So, it seems that there was a
*19:13.480- 19:18.560* :  power struggle between the leaders of these two groups and this fighting is continuing for eight
*19:18.560- 19:26.440* :  months now. So far, it was concentrated in the capital, Khartoum and a city nearby, as well as in
*19:26.440- 19:33.100* :  the western part of the country in Darfur. So, what is actually happening on the ground around Khartoum
*19:33.100- 19:38.640* :  at the moment? What we're hearing is an area which is called Al-Jazira, which is found
*19:38.640- 19:43.460* :  south of the capital Khartoum and which used to be a safe heaven for many people who are
*19:43.460- 19:49.160* :  fleeing the violence, is the latest hot spot after fighters of the rapid support forces
*19:49.640- 19:52.500* :  attacked it and then there was an incursion by their fighters.
*19:52.840- 19:57.800* :  And after eight months of fighting, are either side getting any upper hand in this?
*19:58.140- 20:04.140* :  It seems that the rapid support forces were having some momentum in Darfur area in the western
*20:04.140- 20:11.500* :  part while the government, the armed forces had control in the capital in Khartoum and now it
*20:11.500- 20:16.820* :  seems that they're fighting for the control of the capital Khartoum as well as this this area
*20:16.820- 20:22.260* :  called Al-Jazira, which is found south of the capital. Now, the WFP, as we heard a bit earlier,
*20:22.260- 20:28.020* :  says this has become a forgotten war and the UN is warning that 30 million people, which is
*20:28.020- 20:34.300* :  two-thirds of the population, are in need of assistance. Absolutely, it's a really forgotten war.
*20:34.740- 20:39.820* :  Now, the World Food Programme is saying that 18 million people have said that are facing a
*20:39.820- 20:44.900* :  cute hunger and now this fighting is happening as other countries are pushing its rainy season,
*20:44.900- 20:51.160* :  where farmers were supposed to do their farming. So, if their farming are interrupted by this
*20:51.160- 20:56.860* :  fighting, the people in need of aid and the coming months could increase. Also, that women's
*20:56.860- 21:02.480* :  remember that around 7 million people are pushed out of their homes. Many of them are seeking
*21:02.480- 21:07.420* :  refuge in neighboring countries like Chad and Egypt and South Sudan. Others are internally
*21:07.420- 21:10.360* :  displaced. So, this is a massive humanitarian need in Sudan right now.
*21:14.700- 21:20.400* :  Antonio Guterres has warned that human rights are under attack while praising those who defend
*21:20.400- 21:26.560* :  them. Mr. Guterres said age-old hatreds from racism to xenophobia and religious intolerance
*21:26.560- 21:32.880* :  were resurging with vengeance. He was speaking at a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the
*21:32.880- 21:38.740* :  universal declaration of human rights. The universal declaration of human rights is a clarion
*21:39.020- 21:46.080* :  to act in accordance with the fundamental truth that each of us is an equal member of a single
*21:46.080- 21:55.340* :  human family. 75 years on, the world must recall that wisdom and it must act on it
*21:56.420- 22:02.760* :  because human rights are under attack around the world. Meanwhile, a UN report says the Taliban
*22:02.760- 22:07.400* :  government in Afghanistan is putting women survivors of domestic abuse in prison,
*22:07.400- 22:13.140* :  claiming it's for their own protection. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan
*22:13.140- 22:19.680* :  says the authorities have closed all 23 state-sponsored women's shelters because they see no need for
*22:19.680- 22:25.640* :  them. The report says levels of gender-based violence against Afghan women and girls were high
*22:25.640- 22:31.740* :  even before the Taliban retook control two years ago. But it says the economic and humanitarian
*22:31.740- 22:38.080* :  hardships afflicting Afghanistan since then have made the problem worse. Matthew Amriliwala
*22:38.080- 22:43.740* :  spoke to Heather Barr from Human Rights Watch and asked her for her reaction to the Taliban's actions.
*22:43.820- 22:50.540* :  This report documents what Afghan women have known since August 15, 2021, which is that
*22:50.540- 22:56.420* :  one of the first things the Taliban did after they took over was to dismantle the whole system
*22:56.420- 23:01.460* :  that had been put in place by the government and NGOs to respond to violence against women.
*23:01.460- 23:08.080* :  It took them a bit longer, but after that they largely dismantled the legal system. There's
*23:08.080- 23:12.800* :  been more attention to than banning girls from education, women from work, but this is an
*23:12.800- 23:18.880* :  important piece, too, of their systemic deprivation of the rights of women and girls. That
*23:18.880- 23:25.100* :  crackdown is continuing and getting worse as we speak. The Taliban officials have said they would
*23:25.100- 23:31.260* :  ask male members of the family to make, quote, a commitment not to harm women survivors
*23:31.260- 23:36.160* :  of abuse. Even when I read that out, that seems absolutely extraordinary.
*23:36.660- 23:40.980* :  I mean, the Taliban have sent a very clear message that women are the property of their male
*23:40.980- 23:45.920* :  family members. They've also said that, you know, if women go out and are not dressed as a
*23:45.920- 23:50.320* :  Taliban, thinks they should be, they'll punish the male family members rather than the women
*23:50.320- 23:57.680* :  themselves. So women are in this situation where their male family members are really being seen
*23:57.680- 24:03.280* :  by the Taliban as their owners and their keepers. It's an impossible situation for them and
*24:03.280- 24:09.040* :  they've been waiting a long time for the international community to respond appropriately to this
*24:09.040- 24:13.440* :  very serious crisis, which is the worst situation for women in the world right now.
*24:13.580- 24:19.180* :  I'll come back to that thought in a moment, but shelters, they have been closed. Are there any sort
*24:19.180- 24:25.240* :  of safe spaces for women left? Well, you know, one safe space that existed until a couple months
*24:25.260- 24:30.380* :  ago was beauty salons, which, you know, that might sound silly, but it was actually one of the only
*24:30.380- 24:36.100* :  spaces where women could go and speak to other women, get advice, perhaps get some kind of
*24:36.100- 24:42.880* :  protection. The Taliban closed them about three months ago at a cost of 60,000 jobs for women
*24:42.880- 24:48.760* :  and also the loss, but one of the only spaces left where women could get help from other women.
*24:49.140- 24:56.540* :  Briefly on this, what sort of stories are you hearing in your organization emerging as a result
*24:56.540- 25:01.440* :  of everything that we've been talking about? Well, it's important to say that if women are fleeing
*25:01.440- 25:07.100* :  violence and are sent to prison, their cellmate may well be a women's rights protestor because
*25:07.100- 25:12.940* :  one of the things that we're seeing is that the Taliban are arbitrarily detaining and really
*25:12.940- 25:19.120* :  forcibly disappearing a large number of women's rights protestors. We've spoken to some of them
*25:19.540- 25:24.680* :  who have eventually been released after having been tortured in prison. These are the women who
*25:24.680- 25:29.700* :  come out on the streets and protested against the Taliban's policies and tried to get the world
*25:29.700- 25:35.560* :  to pay attention. And you mentioned the international community. I mean, it appears that they have
*25:35.560- 25:42.660* :  few levers. What do you think in addition should be being done here? Well, Malali Yusuf Sahib gave
*25:42.660- 25:47.920* :  a speech in South Africa 10 days ago where she said that the world should recognize the situation
*25:47.920- 25:53.780* :  in Afghanistan as gender apartheid. I think that one of the things the international community needs
*25:53.780- 25:59.020* :  to do is avoid normalizing this and kind of moving on and forgetting about the situation.
*25:59.020- 26:05.700* :  Afghan women feel very, very forgotten by the entire world and they want people to realize
*26:05.700- 26:09.220* :  that what happens to them has implications for women's rights globally.
*26:10.080- 26:15.720* :  They're the bar from human rights watch. Participants at a major UN forum aimed at finding
*26:15.720- 26:22.560* :  solutions to the global refugee crisis have pledged more than $2.2 billion to help refugees
*26:22.560- 26:28.000* :  and the countries that host them. The head of the UN Refugee Agency, Felipe Grande,
*26:28.000- 26:34.140* :  said the forum in Geneva wasn't just about giving aid to refugees but allowing them to tell the
*26:34.140- 26:39.580* :  world their own stories and suggesting their own solutions. I cannot help but think that we were
*26:39.580- 26:46.800* :  even more energized by the participation of the more than 300 refugees here. Allow me to ask
*26:47.380- 26:56.200* :  those refugees or former refugees and staples people to please stand so we can salute your spirit.
*26:59.000- 27:03.680* :  At a time when the numbers of refugees worldwide have reached record highs,
*27:03.680- 27:08.800* :  thousands of delegates from nearly 170 countries attended the three-day event.
*27:08.800- 27:13.360* :  I heard more about the pledges from the BBC's Chinatullil, who's in Geneva.
*27:14.260- 27:18.980* :  These pledges came from a host of organisations, from businesses,
*27:19.100- 27:25.260* :  philanthropic foundations as well as governments but it's not just about financial help.
*27:25.300- 27:30.540* :  The head of the UN Refugee Agency said the private sector had also pledged to create
*27:30.540- 27:36.580* :  thousands of jobs for refugees and states have also pledged to resettle a million refugees by
*27:36.580- 27:42.360* :  the year 2030. But with unprecedented numbers of people displaced by conflicts in Ukraine,
*27:42.360- 27:47.320* :  Sudan and Myanmar, as well as many other places, that still leaves some of the world's poorest
*27:47.320- 27:52.880* :  countries hosting majority of refugees. And it's only the second time this global refugee forum
*27:52.880- 27:56.380* :  has been held. How did it differ from the first one four years ago?
*27:57.060- 28:02.220* :  Yes, this time there was more emphasis on hearing from refugees themselves and how they were
*28:02.520- 28:07.400* :  helping themselves and each other. There's a special award which is given for helping refugees.
*28:07.400- 28:14.520* :  It went to Somalian-born Abdul-ahi-Miray. Now he grew up in a refugee camp but he then became
*28:14.520- 28:21.320* :  a journalist and he set up a project that has seen more than 100,000 books distributed to children
*28:21.320- 28:25.980* :  in that same refugee camp. And we also heard from an Afghan woman Khalid the Papal who
*28:25.980- 28:32.500* :  overcame huge opposition in her home country to found and then captain the women's football team
*28:33.000- 28:38.820* :  only to then be forced to flee once the Taliban seized back power. She used sport not just to help
*28:38.820- 28:44.700* :  herself but also to help other refugee women connect with each other. To use the power of sport
*28:44.700- 28:51.480* :  and education where we change the narratives around women, around refugees, around sports
*28:51.480- 28:59.340* :  to be the role models but also share the positive message to the world by showing if we get
*28:59.340- 29:05.180* :  the opportunities and possibilities and one hand of help then we we can make an impact.
*29:05.620- 29:10.100* :  So we've seen lots of ambitious pledges being made to help people like Khalid the
*29:10.680- 29:16.120* :  but last time round there were similar pledges made, more than two billion dollars were pledged
*29:16.120- 29:21.180* :  last time round. It's not clear that all of those were honored. This time round the UN refugee
*29:21.180- 29:28.220* :  agency says that it's established mechanisms to ensure that that money will be paid at a time when
*29:28.220- 29:35.500* :  funding for aid agencies is falling to very low levels. It's not just about the money that's
*29:35.500- 29:41.420* :  being pledged but it's in the way that it's being used to help refugees at a time when there is
*29:41.420- 29:47.520* :  more emphasis now on trying to get them to to do things for themselves and to try to give more
*29:47.520- 29:54.140* :  back to the communities that host them. Jenna Gillil in Geneva. The Netherlands is starting a trial
*29:54.140- 29:59.860* :  to decriminalise the production of cannabis. The four-year experiment will start in two cities
*29:59.860- 30:04.840* :  Brader and Tilburg. The consumption of cannabis in small quantities has long been allowed in
*30:04.840- 30:09.780* :  the Netherlands but the production of the drug remained illegal even though it was often tolerated.
*30:10.220- 30:15.460* :  The aim now is to crack down on drug dealers and guarantee a high quality and safer product
*30:15.460- 30:20.080* :  for consumers. Tim Franks bowed to Ernst Cooper's The Dutch Health Minister.
*30:20.820- 30:26.960* :  We have had a policy in the Netherlands we're getting now for approximately 50 years in which we
*30:26.960- 30:33.720* :  tolerate the sales, the possession of limited amounts and also the use of cannabis and the
*30:33.720- 30:39.780* :  sales is then traditionally done for these 50 years in our coffee shops but this has created a
*30:39.780- 30:46.420* :  somewhat I would call it schizophrenic situation because the culture the growth and also the
*30:46.420- 30:53.000* :  distribution of the cannabis remains illegal and that from a health perspective creates a situation
*30:53.540- 30:58.880* :  in which other than with all other consumer products which are strictly regulated and controls
*30:58.880- 31:05.840* :  for reasons of consumer safety for cannabis there is no such situation. I have no control over
*31:05.840- 31:13.920* :  the growth. I have no control of the presence of pesticides or other products within the cannabis
*31:14.540- 31:21.720* :  and so the main thinking for starting this project is to try and completely control and regulate
*31:21.720- 31:29.280* :  the whole process from growth distribution to NGOs. How is that going to work though in terms of
*31:29.280- 31:36.420* :  just trying to ensure that what is grown for sale in these two cities doesn't then just end up
*31:36.660- 31:41.320* :  elsewhere? You're saying you're creating a closed system but it will be difficult enough to
*31:41.320- 31:46.280* :  control within the Netherlands and then of course you've got open borders to the rest of the
*31:46.280- 31:52.440* :  European Union. Sure. So what we're doing is that we selected a total of 10 commercial
*31:52.440- 31:58.440* :  growers who are then strictly controlled. They have to keep track of all their production
*31:58.440- 32:05.120* :  so it's a fully track and trace system from the original plant and the original grower to the
*32:05.120- 32:11.720* :  ultimate end use of the consumer and that allows us to strictly control that indeed there is no
*32:11.720- 32:16.260* :  materials passing cross borders entering the Netherlands in illegal market.
*32:16.960- 32:22.440* :  Ernst Cooper is the Dutch health minister. Now if there's one thing Italians get worked up
*32:22.440- 32:29.520* :  about it's food. You mess with Italian food at your peril and yet one Italian food historian has
*32:29.520- 32:35.700* :  done just that. He posted a video of himself making what he describes as the original version of
*32:35.700- 32:41.420* :  Carbonara and it's substantially different from what the world understands the dish to be
*32:42.080- 32:47.600* :  and to say some Italians are a bit annoyed would be an understatement. A shantol heartle explains.
*32:52.660- 32:58.700* :  Lucas Cesari, a Bologna-based writer, proudly shows off his creation. A dish he says was inspired
*32:58.700- 33:04.800* :  by the first Carbonara recipe published in an Italian cookery magazine in 1954.
*33:05.520- 33:11.900* :  Instead of using eggs, cured ham and Italian pecorino cheese which are key to what many consider
*33:11.900- 33:18.560* :  the country's flagship dish. He's using Swiss gruyette cheese, bacon and scrambled eggs.
*33:19.240- 33:24.840* :  In a follow-up video Cesari says he's been abused online for daring to recreate a historical
*33:31.000- 33:35.340* :  recipe. This is angered that Carbonara purists who didn't study history and think
*33:35.340- 33:41.120* :  that our beautiful recipe has always remained identical to itself. Unfortunately, this is not the
*33:41.120- 33:47.440* :  case. There have been hundreds of versions of Carbonara. Well, it is unclear where the origins of
*33:47.440- 33:53.400* :  the Carbonara truly lie. People in Rome had very strong opinions on Cesari's adaptation.
*33:57.340- 34:03.160* :  These people should be locked up, locked up. It seems crazy to me. It seems to distort what is
*34:03.160- 34:09.540* :  traditional. Let him eat it. Even after the backlash, Cesari says he will recreate another Italian
*34:09.540- 34:17.300* :  classic, a traditional Neapolitan pizza from the 1800s with clams. Shantel heartle with the old
*34:17.300- 34:25.500* :  fashion way of producing Carbonara. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition
*34:25.500- 34:31.080* :  of the Global News Podcast later. Before we go, here's Harry Blight with news of the happy pod,
