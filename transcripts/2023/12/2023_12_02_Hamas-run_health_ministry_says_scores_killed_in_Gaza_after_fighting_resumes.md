*01:36.640- 01:38.220* :  from the BBC World Service.
*01:40.720- 01:42.580* :  I'm Robin Brant and in the early hours
*01:42.580- 01:45.500* :  of Saturday 2nd of December, these are our main stories.
*01:46.140- 01:49.680* :  Israel says it has attacked 200 targets in the Gaza Strip
*01:50.080- 01:52.460* :  since the ceasefire with Hamas ended on Friday.
*01:52.500- 01:56.560* :  Hamas says the attacks have killed more than 170 Palestinians.
*01:57.180- 02:00.560* :  The Republican George Santos has become only the sixth person
*02:00.560- 02:03.220* :  in US history to be expelled from Congress.
*02:04.000- 02:06.560* :  And a senior official in Ukraine has said two attacks,
*02:06.580- 02:08.740* :  thousands of kilometers inside Russia,
*02:09.260- 02:11.420* :  were carried out by Ukrainian security services.
*02:14.180- 02:15.220* :  Also in this podcast,
*02:15.220- 02:18.980* :  the first woman to become a US Supreme Court justice has died.
*02:19.220- 02:22.080* :  I've always said that it's exciting and wonderful
*02:22.120- 02:23.860* :  to be the first to do something,
*02:24.200- 02:25.560* :  but I didn't want to be the last.
*02:26.160- 02:28.340* :  We look back at Sandra Day O'Connor's life.
*02:32.080- 02:35.140* :  Israel says its war planes have attacked 200 targets
*02:35.140- 02:38.460* :  in the Gaza Strip since the collapse of the seven-day ceasefire
*02:38.700- 02:39.500* :  on Friday morning.
*02:40.060- 02:42.460* :  Hamas health officials say the renewed bombardment
*02:42.700- 02:44.840* :  has killed more than 170 people.
*02:45.440- 02:48.700* :  Both sides have accused each other of breaching the ceasefire deal.
*02:49.160- 02:51.920* :  Speaking into by the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken,
*02:52.260- 02:54.240* :  blamed Hamas for the resumption of violence.
*02:54.900- 02:56.560* :  A mass reneged on commitments it made.
*02:56.560- 02:58.600* :  In fact, even before the pause came going in,
*02:59.400- 03:01.540* :  it committed an introsistarist attack in Jerusalem,
*03:02.080- 03:04.300* :  killing three people, wounding others, including Americans.
*03:05.440- 03:07.780* :  It began firing rockets before the pause ended.
*03:07.780- 03:10.740* :  And as I said, it reneged on commitments it made
*03:11.380- 03:12.780* :  in terms of releasing certain hospitals.
*03:13.420- 03:16.200* :  Well, Israeli forces have dropped leaflets in areas
*03:16.200- 03:19.900* :  around the southern city of Han Unis, warning people to evacuate.
*03:19.980- 03:23.500* :  Earlier, Mr Blinken said he had made it clear to Israel
*03:23.500- 03:26.820* :  that it was imperative to put in place clear protections
*03:26.820- 03:30.400* :  for civilians, like the leaflet drop and a safe zone map.
*03:31.000- 03:34.160* :  Israel has promised to hit hard now the ceasefire has ended.
*03:34.580- 03:36.720* :  Elon Levy is an Israeli government spokesman.
*03:37.100- 03:39.160* :  Having chosen to hold onto our women,
*03:39.760- 03:43.520* :  Hamas will now take the mother of all thumpings.
*03:44.000- 03:46.980* :  As of now, after Hamas violated the framework for a pause
*03:46.980- 03:49.000* :  in the fighting, hostilities have resumed
*03:49.360- 03:52.660* :  and the IDF has resumed combat against the Hamas army
*03:52.820- 03:54.200* :  of terror in the Gaza Strip.
*03:54.280- 03:57.420* :  The Israeli army has confirmed that at least four hostages
*03:57.420- 04:00.680* :  have died while being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
*04:01.160- 04:02.380* :  The oldest was 85.
*04:03.020- 04:05.980* :  110 hostages have been released so far,
*04:06.420- 04:10.480* :  at least 137 people are still held captive by Hamas
*04:10.820- 04:12.640* :  and other militant groups in Gaza.
*04:13.320- 04:16.340* :  Meanwhile, thousands of garrisons who move from northern Gaza
*04:16.340- 04:19.460* :  to the south to escape bombing now find themselves
*04:19.460- 04:20.980* :  in unsafe zones again.
*04:21.540- 04:23.500* :  So what are garrisons making of this?
*04:23.720- 04:26.420* :  Well, Akram is a translator based in Hanyunis
*04:26.540- 04:27.440* :  in the south of Gaza.
*04:27.980- 04:29.860* :  My colleague Anita Anand spoke to him
*04:29.860- 04:32.840* :  and asked him to describe what was happening there on Friday.
*04:33.220- 04:37.360* :  Well, today was catastrophic by all the meanings of the word.
*04:37.740- 04:41.840* :  Very heavy bombardment in Hanyunis and Rafah
*04:41.980- 04:46.280* :  in Anosairat, Al-Borayj, in Gaza, three or four different places
*04:46.280- 04:49.560* :  in Gaza and two or three places in Gaza North.
*04:49.920- 04:53.980* :  We heard that this morning began with a huge leaflet drop
*04:53.980- 04:58.100* :  from Israel warning people around Hanyunis and in the south
*04:58.100- 05:00.880* :  that they might have to evacuate the areas that they'd been in.
*05:00.880- 05:01.920* :  What do you know of that?
*05:01.920- 05:03.600* :  And have you seen any of these leaflets?
*05:04.220- 05:06.520* :  Yes, those leaflets were dropped
*05:07.280- 05:08.700* :  and they were outlining.
*05:08.700- 05:12.340* :  They had different areas inclusive, Gaza, middle zone,
*05:12.340- 05:13.580* :  central area of Gaza.
*05:14.100- 05:16.600* :  And there are prompting people to hit south
*05:17.320- 05:19.680* :  to the human safe humanitarian area
*05:19.680- 05:21.280* :  as described by those leaflets.
*05:22.060- 05:25.300* :  And they were targeting different four different areas
*05:25.300- 05:28.320* :  in Hanyunis, East Hanyunis, Al-Garara area,
*05:29.200- 05:32.300* :  Beni-Sohayla area, Khuzaa area, An Abasan area.
*05:32.700- 05:34.260* :  And people were asked to move south
*05:34.580- 05:38.260* :  because the same leaflet says that this
*05:38.260- 05:43.960* :  is a very dangerous battlefield of military operations feet.
*05:44.760- 05:47.400* :  And some of the people presumably who are in these areas
*05:47.400- 05:51.120* :  have already moved once from northern Gaza
*05:51.640- 05:52.600* :  and now are moving again.
*05:52.800- 05:54.580* :  I mean, do you know how easy logistically
*05:54.580- 05:55.680* :  it is going to be for them?
*05:56.220- 05:58.000* :  Logistically, it's extremely challenging
*05:58.000- 05:59.940* :  and you should also take into consideration
*05:59.940- 06:03.900* :  that some people were moving from Hanyunis East to Hanyunis West.
*06:03.980- 06:06.940* :  And now their people are asked to move from Hanyunis East
*06:07.200- 06:10.180* :  to the Gaza Strip very south, which is Rafa area
*06:10.580- 06:12.500* :  in that particular area that is called
*06:12.500- 06:14.740* :  as a humanitarian assistance area.
*06:15.360- 06:17.820* :  How concentrated is it going to be in that area
*06:18.080- 06:19.480* :  if all these people move?
*06:20.180- 06:22.900* :  I don't think it's the whole thing
*06:22.920- 06:24.420* :  is not about this particular area.
*06:24.420- 06:27.200* :  The whole thing is about asking people of Gaza
*06:27.200- 06:29.520* :  to leave towards the Egyptian border.
*06:30.280- 06:33.020* :  I mean, are you suggesting that this is some plan
*06:33.020- 06:34.640* :  to actually push people into Egypt?
*06:35.460- 06:37.460* :  Yeah, yeah, yeah, apparently that has started
*06:37.600- 06:39.160* :  in the very first day of the war
*06:39.800- 06:42.880* :  and they have been keeping the very same narrative,
*06:42.920- 06:45.520* :  the very same request and have been asking Gaza
*06:45.520- 06:47.600* :  and telling Gaza that there is no way
*06:48.060- 06:49.840* :  out of this misery and bombardment
*06:49.840- 06:52.240* :  except by fleeing to the south.
*06:52.520- 06:54.920* :  And now it seems to be that they are pushing the ones
*06:54.920- 06:57.860* :  who are already in the south coming from the north
*06:58.120- 06:59.880* :  with the people who are already in the south
*06:59.880- 07:02.460* :  to move towards the further south
*07:02.560- 07:04.020* :  next to the Egyptian border.
*07:04.020- 07:06.400* :  And I wonder why would they keep them next
*07:06.460- 07:07.340* :  to the Egyptian border,
*07:07.340- 07:09.840* :  but when you go back to their statements
*07:10.200- 07:10.940* :  and their positions,
*07:10.940- 07:13.680* :  you understand that something big is being prepared
*07:13.680- 07:16.440* :  and they want the people to move into Sinai.
*07:16.960- 07:18.660* :  Well, that was Akram a translator
*07:18.660- 07:20.880* :  based in Khan Yunus in the south of Gaza.
*07:21.540- 07:24.180* :  Meanwhile, the Palestinian red crescent says Israel
*07:24.180- 07:26.500* :  has blocked all humanitarian aid
*07:26.500- 07:28.580* :  from entering Gaza through the Rafacrossing
*07:29.120- 07:30.300* :  until further notice.
*07:31.140- 07:34.040* :  Well, for explanation and further context on this,
*07:34.040- 07:35.920* :  I spoke to our correspondent Paul Adams.
*07:35.920- 07:36.920* :  He's in Jerusalem.
*07:37.480- 07:39.380* :  And I began by asking him if the resumption
*07:39.380- 07:42.080* :  in the Israeli offensive has been on the same scale
*07:42.080- 07:43.940* :  as before the recent ceasefire.
*07:44.500- 07:45.060* :  Not quite.
*07:45.060- 07:48.480* :  I mean, this seems to be so far a bombardment
*07:48.480- 07:52.200* :  from the air, from the sea and via artillery.
*07:52.620- 07:54.460* :  In other words, we have not yet seen
*07:54.460- 07:57.400* :  a resumption of Israel's ground operations
*07:57.860- 07:59.580* :  in the Gaza City area.
*07:59.620- 08:02.020* :  Now, that is something which I think is likely
*08:02.040- 08:03.920* :  to take place pretty soon.
*08:04.400- 08:07.060* :  And it's definitely the case that the bombardment
*08:07.060- 08:09.980* :  that we saw today was every bit as destructive
*08:09.980- 08:12.720* :  as previous bombardments with a death toll
*08:13.060- 08:14.400* :  in a region of 100 or so.
*08:14.400- 08:17.880* :  So Palestinians up and down the Gaza Strip
*08:18.020- 08:21.040* :  were definitely plunged back into the kind of reality
*08:21.040- 08:23.580* :  that they were experiencing until about a week ago.
*08:24.160- 08:27.080* :  But we are still waiting for ground operations to resume.
*08:27.380- 08:30.340* :  And Israel's effort to request ask order
*08:30.700- 08:33.760* :  Palestinians in Gaza to move south as resumed as well.
*08:33.760- 08:35.480* :  Am I right that they're sending them
*08:35.480- 08:37.360* :  to even more or advising them to go
*08:37.360- 08:38.800* :  to far more specific areas?
*08:38.800- 08:39.420* :  Is that correct?
*08:39.700- 08:41.440* :  Yes, so what was different about today
*08:41.440- 08:44.860* :  was that the leaflets included a QR code
*08:44.860- 08:47.620* :  so that if you were able with a smartphone
*08:47.620- 08:51.180* :  and you have connectivity, you could download a map
*08:51.280- 08:53.740* :  which divides the Gaza Strip up into hundreds
*08:53.740- 08:55.860* :  of tiny little pockets.
*08:56.440- 09:01.740* :  The idea being that Israel can more accurately direct people
*09:01.740- 09:04.560* :  to leave certain very, very specific areas
*09:04.780- 09:06.400* :  and move to adjacent safe areas.
*09:06.440- 09:08.680* :  This is something clearly that the Americans
*09:08.680- 09:09.940* :  have been pushing for.
*09:10.440- 09:13.120* :  But at the moment, it's just causing confusion
*09:13.420- 09:16.560* :  and a belief that people still are just being told
*09:16.560- 09:18.200* :  to move willy-nilly.
*09:18.500- 09:21.080* :  I think this is the first day that we have seen
*09:21.080- 09:22.860* :  this particular innovation from the Israelis.
*09:22.860- 09:26.920* :  It may be that over time it becomes rather more effective.
*09:26.920- 09:29.000* :  But at the moment, it's just feeding
*09:29.000- 09:31.360* :  into Palestinian fears that they are once again
*09:31.840- 09:33.960* :  being told to leave with no prospect
*09:33.960- 09:35.220* :  of going back to their home.
*09:35.320- 09:36.960* :  And so just to push you on the specifics of that.
*09:37.000- 09:38.820* :  So in the middle of a war that's been going on
*09:38.820- 09:41.140* :  for over eight weeks in a tiny area,
*09:41.140- 09:43.500* :  you need a working phone with power and good connectivity
*09:43.500- 09:44.800* :  to get to a specific place.
*09:45.080- 09:47.880* :  That's more or less the fact of it.
*09:47.880- 09:52.500* :  I mean, the maps didn't even actually include anything like
*09:52.840- 09:54.500* :  what sort of route you should take.
*09:54.680- 09:57.840* :  I mean, this is clearly a gesture towards the Americans saying,
*09:58.480- 10:01.220* :  look, we cannot see a repeat of what we saw before
*10:01.220- 10:04.140* :  with hundreds of thousands of people on the move
*10:04.580- 10:06.060* :  having to move huge distances.
*10:06.060- 10:08.980* :  I mean, Gaza is small, but having to move for miles
*10:09.020- 10:12.980* :  and miles and miles to get to something resembling a safe zone.
*10:13.340- 10:15.120* :  So it is designed to be more specific.
*10:15.180- 10:16.420* :  But at the moment, as I say,
*10:16.720- 10:18.400* :  it's merely causing confusion and doubt.
*10:18.860- 10:20.500* :  Paul Adams speaking to me from Jerusalem.
*10:21.080- 10:23.000* :  Let's go to the United States next.
*10:23.540- 10:25.360* :  And the House of Representatives has voted
*10:25.360- 10:28.720* :  to expel the Republican George Santos from Congress.
*10:29.380- 10:31.480* :  He's only the sixth person in US history
*10:31.480- 10:32.940* :  to be ousted from the chamber.
*10:33.480- 10:35.720* :  Mr. Santos, who was only elected last November,
*10:35.980- 10:38.640* :  was expelled after a slew of revelations
*10:38.640- 10:42.040* :  about campaign fraud and lies about his private life.
*10:42.600- 10:44.640* :  This was the moment that the speaker, Mike Johnson,
*10:44.640- 10:46.100* :  who's in charge of proceedings,
*10:46.180- 10:49.620* :  and also on the same political side as George Santos,
*10:49.620- 10:50.880* :  announced the result.
*10:51.400- 10:54.200* :  On this vote, the Yays are 311.
*10:54.340- 10:58.780* :  The Nays are 114, with two recorded as present.
*10:59.140- 11:00.660* :  Two-thirds voting in the affirmative.
*11:00.660- 11:02.320* :  The resolution is adopted.
*11:04.960- 11:06.740* :  Under clause 5D of rule 20,
*11:06.740- 11:08.840* :  the chair announces to the House that in light
*11:08.840- 11:10.820* :  of the expulsion of the gentleman from New York,
*11:10.820- 11:14.720* :  Mr. Santos, the whole number of the House is now 434.
*11:15.420- 11:18.300* :  So that is a rare moment indeed to hear.
*11:18.500- 11:20.040* :  I asked our Washington correspondent,
*11:20.040- 11:21.900* :  Nomiya Ikbal, for more details.
*11:22.420- 11:24.040* :  The New York congressman's political career
*11:24.040- 11:25.540* :  is basically ended in the same fashion
*11:25.540- 11:27.840* :  that it started, I think, high drama.
*11:28.120- 11:31.820* :  He's a 35-year-old who was elected in November 2023,
*11:32.880- 11:34.680* :  and he has been dogged by claims
*11:34.680- 11:37.080* :  that he simply can't tell the truth.
*11:37.080- 11:39.580* :  So he started off his career by saying
*11:39.580- 11:41.780* :  that he embodies the American dream
*11:41.780- 11:43.760* :  as the son of Brazilian immigrants,
*11:43.780- 11:45.980* :  but for many, it was less of a dream
*11:46.380- 11:47.920* :  and more of a fancestist.
*11:48.320- 11:52.100* :  So a lot of the lies he's accused of putting out there
*11:52.240- 11:55.200* :  are they range from the silly to the more serious accused
*11:55.200- 11:57.020* :  of lying about where he went to college.
*11:57.340- 12:00.400* :  What his background was, he even said that he was a volleyball
*12:00.400- 12:02.820* :  champion and he had to have two knee operations
*12:02.900- 12:03.780* :  which went true.
*12:03.780- 12:07.440* :  He claimed a member of his family had died in 911.
*12:07.440- 12:10.040* :  He claimed his two grandparents died in the Holocaust,
*12:10.040- 12:12.560* :  a lot of that proved to be untrue.
*12:13.360- 12:16.560* :  And then the more serious where he is facing
*12:16.560- 12:19.140* :  more than a dozen federal charges
*12:19.140- 12:22.020* :  accused of wire fraud aggravated identity theft
*12:22.020- 12:24.320* :  conspiracy to commit offense against the US.
*12:25.080- 12:27.300* :  And then on top of that, there was a House Ethics Committee
*12:27.300- 12:29.680* :  report released earlier this month
*12:29.680- 12:32.900* :  which accused him of basically using campaign funds
*12:32.900- 12:34.860* :  to bankroll a lavish lifestyle
*12:34.860- 12:37.220* :  that included paying for Botox treatments,
*12:37.920- 12:40.820* :  paying for a subscription to the adult content website,
*12:40.820- 12:43.340* :  only fans, he denies all of this.
*12:44.000- 12:46.980* :  But, and he has said that these lies are slanderous,
*12:46.980- 12:49.600* :  that this is bullying, but this is all accumulated
*12:49.620- 12:54.780* :  in today's vote, which has seen 311 members of the House
*12:54.780- 12:57.540* :  kick him out, 105 of them were Republicans,
*12:57.540- 13:00.400* :  that's almost a majority, bringing his political career
*13:00.420- 13:00.960* :  to an end.
*13:01.220- 13:03.560* :  And just quickly, Nomiya, on the balance of power,
*13:03.560- 13:05.820* :  does it change the numbers at all in the House?
*13:05.940- 13:09.900* :  It does, so we know the Republicans had a slim majority anyway.
*13:10.060- 13:11.860* :  So that's now, that's now dropped.
*13:11.900- 13:14.240* :  So any party line vote, you know,
*13:14.240- 13:18.060* :  the Republicans can only afford basically to lose five members
*13:18.300- 13:20.860* :  and also remember his district is now up for grabs.
*13:20.860- 13:22.800* :  Next year, there'll be a special election
*13:22.800- 13:24.740* :  and that is a democratic opportunity.
*13:24.740- 13:27.100* :  Nomiya Eggball in Washington, DC.
*13:27.400- 13:29.280* :  We're going to stay there because the first woman
*13:29.280- 13:33.260* :  to serve on the US Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor, has died.
*13:33.260- 13:34.640* :  She was 93.
*13:35.420- 13:37.300* :  A politician turned legal scholar.
*13:37.300- 13:41.020* :  She was appointed to the court in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan.
*13:41.640- 13:44.800* :  Justice O'Connor announced her withdrawal from public life
*13:44.800- 13:47.800* :  five years ago after she was diagnosed with dementia.
*13:48.400- 13:50.860* :  Oliver Conway looks back at her life and her legacy.
*13:51.480- 13:54.080* :  Once described as the most powerful woman in America,
*13:54.080- 13:56.600* :  Sandra Day O'Connor cast the decisive vote
*13:56.600- 13:59.140* :  on a host of laws affecting US society.
*13:59.680- 14:01.520* :  A former Republican state senator,
*14:02.000- 14:03.480* :  she disappointed many on the right
*14:03.480- 14:06.680* :  by reaffirming the row versus way judgment on abortion.
*14:07.280- 14:10.660* :  But she sided with conservatives in the 2000 US election
*14:11.100- 14:12.900* :  as the Supreme Court handed Florida
*14:12.900- 14:16.000* :  and thus the presidency to George W. Bush.
*14:16.420- 14:18.920* :  A judgment she later acknowledged was controversial.
*14:19.340- 14:21.400* :  I think people were very divided
*14:21.400- 14:24.160* :  as they were on the election itself.
*14:24.460- 14:28.020* :  But I have to say it is remarkable that we live
*14:28.480- 14:30.360* :  under a system of a rule of law
*14:30.820- 14:34.100* :  where hot button issues like that can be resolved
*14:34.100- 14:36.840* :  without people fighting it out in the streets.
*14:37.620- 14:40.720* :  Born in 1930, Sandra Day O'Connor grew up on a ranch.
*14:40.740- 14:44.280* :  Despite graduating third in her class at Stanford Law School,
*14:44.280- 14:47.580* :  she couldn't get an interview let alone a job as a lawyer
*14:47.580- 14:50.680* :  so began working for free in a county attorney's office.
*14:50.900- 14:52.680* :  I said I know you don't have space,
*14:52.680- 14:56.240* :  but I met your secretary and she was very nice
*14:56.240- 14:59.400* :  and she has room out where her desk is.
*14:59.540- 15:01.460* :  I'd be happy to put my desk there.
*15:02.220- 15:03.700* :  But that's how I got a job.
*15:04.440- 15:07.580* :  No pay and my desk was in with his secretaries.
*15:07.920- 15:11.160* :  After a successful legal and political career in Arizona,
*15:11.180- 15:14.000* :  she was asked by Ronald Reagan in 1981
*15:14.000- 15:16.880* :  to become the first woman on the Supreme Court.
*15:17.440- 15:19.360* :  Worried that she might fail and mess things up
*15:19.360- 15:21.380* :  for other women, she nearly said no.
*15:21.600- 15:25.240* :  I knew that it would be a totally new experience.
*15:26.000- 15:29.420* :  I did not know if I could do the job well enough.
*15:29.880- 15:33.260* :  I've always said that it's exciting and wonderful
*15:33.280- 15:35.000* :  to be the first to do something,
*15:35.680- 15:37.160* :  but I didn't want to be the last.
*15:38.220- 15:42.880* :  And to take on that enormous task was a real concern to me.
*15:43.280- 15:44.880* :  Justice O'Connor earned a reputation
*15:44.880- 15:46.980* :  on the court as a hardworking conservative,
*15:47.020- 15:50.680* :  but on many issues like religion, gender and the death penalty,
*15:51.100- 15:52.280* :  she sided with the liberals.
*15:53.000- 15:55.040* :  Critics accused her of paying too much attention
*15:55.040- 15:56.480* :  to the politics of the day,
*15:56.480- 15:59.160* :  but she said she took each case on its merits.
*15:59.880- 16:00.860* :  After 12 years,
*16:00.860- 16:03.180* :  she was joined by a second woman on the court.
*16:03.600- 16:06.400* :  But when Sandra Day O'Connor stepped down in 2006,
*16:06.400- 16:09.620* :  she was replaced by a man, much to her disappointment.
*16:09.620- 16:13.960* :  I really had perhaps again naively assumed
*16:14.720- 16:17.660* :  my successor would likely be female.
*16:18.120- 16:22.280* :  I just wish that our court had more women sitting on it.
*16:22.780- 16:26.160* :  We are numerically about half the population
*16:26.260- 16:27.000* :  in the country.
*16:27.480- 16:29.460* :  She withdrew from public life in 2018
*16:29.460- 16:31.340* :  after being diagnosed with dementia,
*16:31.780- 16:34.660* :  saying, as a young cowgirl from the Arizona desert,
*16:35.160- 16:36.860* :  I never could have imagined that one day
*16:36.860- 16:38.680* :  I would become the first woman justice
*16:38.980- 16:40.420* :  on the US Supreme Court.
*16:40.960- 16:43.620* :  Oliver Conway on the life of Sandra Day O'Connor,
*16:43.660- 16:45.700* :  who has died at the age of 93,
*16:45.700- 16:47.700* :  and I think it's worth saying that the court
*16:47.700- 16:51.320* :  on which she was the first now has four female members.
*16:53.100- 16:55.060* :  Four women living with HIV and Kenya
*16:55.060- 16:58.080* :  have each been awarded $20,000 in damages
*16:58.080- 17:01.040* :  for being sterilized without their informed consent.
*17:01.660- 17:03.640* :  It's the second time that the Kenyan High Court
*17:03.640- 17:05.940* :  has determined that women have been coerced
*17:06.200- 17:07.980* :  into a permanent medical procedure
*17:08.460- 17:09.680* :  because of their HIV status.
*17:10.240- 17:11.840* :  To protect the identities of the women,
*17:11.840- 17:13.040* :  we've changed their names
*17:13.040- 17:15.820* :  and had their voices recorded by actors in this report
*17:16.400- 17:17.220* :  by Dorcas Wangira.
*17:20.940- 17:22.680* :  In Kenya's capital, Nairobi,
*17:23.020- 17:25.080* :  Nema cries because she and her husband
*17:25.080- 17:27.200* :  had not been able to have a child together.
*17:27.700- 17:29.000* :  A husband is now dead.
*17:30.740- 17:32.000* :  He wanted a child with me,
*17:32.680- 17:34.820* :  but I was sterilized before I could fulfill that.
*17:36.060- 17:37.980* :  When we went to the hospital, he didn't know.
*17:39.100- 17:41.360* :  Nema lives with HIV and had children
*17:41.360- 17:42.860* :  from a previous relationship,
*17:43.340- 17:45.980* :  but between 2005 and 2010,
*17:46.560- 17:48.840* :  she and three other women living with HIV
*17:49.480- 17:50.740* :  went to government run
*17:50.740- 17:53.500* :  to Muani maternity hospital to give birth.
*17:54.080- 17:56.140* :  It would be the last time they would conceive.
*17:59.960- 18:02.900* :  I feel so much pain because when I was in labor,
*18:03.380- 18:05.460* :  I knew I was consenting to a cesarean section.
*18:05.500- 18:08.620* :  I wasn't told that I was going to have a tubal ligation.
*18:09.460- 18:11.320* :  I thought it was ordinal family planning.
*18:11.800- 18:14.160* :  If they had explained the procedure properly to me,
*18:14.640- 18:16.080* :  I wouldn't have signed that paper.
*18:17.180- 18:19.520* :  By lateral tubal ligation, BTL,
*18:19.900- 18:22.400* :  is a surgical procedure that cuts, ties,
*18:22.400- 18:23.620* :  buns, clips,
*18:24.060- 18:26.380* :  or removes parts of a woman's fallopian tubes
*18:26.800- 18:27.940* :  to prevent pregnancy.
*18:28.660- 18:30.640* :  All four women told the Kenyan High Court
*18:30.920- 18:32.840* :  that they were operated on under pressure.
*18:33.280- 18:34.880* :  One of them, who we named Pender,
*18:35.200- 18:36.340* :  was given the reason why
*18:36.340- 18:38.740* :  when she went to the same hospital to give birth.
*18:40.280- 18:43.520* :  We were being sterilized because we were living with HIV.
*18:44.080- 18:46.820* :  I could only get the formula milk for my infant
*18:47.240- 18:48.960* :  for as long as I could show proof
*18:49.120- 18:51.300* :  that I had gone through the BTL procedure.
*18:52.220- 18:54.240* :  Pender wasn't alone in facing coaxial.
*18:54.240- 18:57.160* :  Other women were told that if they consented to the procedure,
*18:57.520- 18:59.640* :  they wouldn't have to pay for their maternity fees.
*19:00.200- 19:01.840* :  One of them, whom we named Amani,
*19:02.140- 19:04.560* :  claimed that she wasn't told the full implications
*19:05.120- 19:06.440* :  of undergoing BTL.
*19:06.880- 19:09.420* :  What hurt me the most is that they didn't tell me
*19:09.420- 19:10.800* :  that the TL was permanent.
*19:11.320- 19:13.220* :  They didn't tell me to come with my husband
*19:13.220- 19:15.340* :  so that we make the decision together.
*19:15.820- 19:17.120* :  It made my husband live.
*19:17.560- 19:19.640* :  A father petitioner who we named Faraha
*19:19.900- 19:22.520* :  told us how her entire family was impacted.
*19:23.100- 19:25.780* :  My husband asked me why I didn't tell him.
*19:26.440- 19:27.660* :  He started drinking heavily
*19:27.660- 19:30.000* :  until he was hit by a car and died.
*19:30.620- 19:32.420* :  We had planned to have five children.
*19:33.200- 19:35.420* :  These organizations really wronged me
*19:35.580- 19:38.040* :  because they ruined my life and that of my family.
*19:38.440- 19:40.040* :  After nine years of hearings,
*19:40.420- 19:42.400* :  the High Court has ruled that forcing the women
*19:42.400- 19:45.060* :  to have a tubilligation was a violation
*19:45.060- 19:46.580* :  of their fundamental rights.
*19:47.200- 19:49.140* :  Their damages will be paid jointly
*19:49.140- 19:51.920* :  by the medical child he's made a sense on Frontier
*19:52.300- 19:53.640* :  and Maristope's International,
*19:53.640- 19:57.080* :  as well as by the state-owned Pumwani Maternity Hospital.
*19:57.900- 19:59.540* :  We received this written statement
*19:59.540- 20:01.220* :  from Maristope's International.
*20:01.820- 20:04.500* :  As a member of the Global Reproductive Rights Community,
*20:04.760- 20:06.600* :  we understand the stigma that people living
*20:06.600- 20:08.140* :  with HIV continue to face.
*20:08.800- 20:10.640* :  We will continue to undertake rigorous training
*20:10.640- 20:13.100* :  and monitoring to ensure that the highest standards
*20:13.100- 20:14.180* :  are adhered to,
*20:14.560- 20:15.920* :  and we will never be complacent
*20:15.920- 20:17.220* :  about the care we deliver.
*20:17.680- 20:19.980* :  Dr. Jair Elias is a project coordinator
*20:20.060- 20:22.600* :  for Medicines of Frontier in Kenya.
*20:23.120- 20:24.500* :  MSF, we never did,
*20:24.560- 20:27.640* :  and we are not doing medical sterilization
*20:27.640- 20:29.160* :  in our missions in Kenya.
*20:29.380- 20:32.180* :  If the patient opt to undergo a bilateral tubilligation,
*20:32.280- 20:35.480* :  we normally refer them to third-party facilities
*20:35.860- 20:36.920* :  to have it done there.
*20:37.260- 20:39.380* :  I have been informed about the judgment
*20:39.380- 20:42.340* :  and we accepted it as the way it comes.
*20:42.340- 20:45.400* :  We acknowledge the part of the responsibility,
*20:45.400- 20:47.380* :  our share of the responsibility

*21:00.220- 21:01.620* :  but didn't respond.
*21:02.300- 21:04.580* :  In the end, the four women see the ruling
*21:04.580- 21:06.580* :  as more than just a compensation.
*21:07.100- 21:09.400* :  It was an acknowledgement of what they have endured,
*21:09.980- 21:11.860* :  an irreversible medical procedure
*21:11.860- 21:13.940* :  that violated their basic rights.

*23:26.380- 23:28.140* :  Welcome back to The Global News Podcast.
*23:28.140- 23:30.500* :  Now, a senior Ukrainian official,
*23:30.920- 23:33.640* :  the told BBC News that the country's security services
*23:33.640- 23:36.640* :  have blown up a rail line in Russia's far east.
*23:37.180- 23:39.800* :  Explosions are said to have occurred first in a tunnel
*23:40.200- 23:43.100* :  and then later on a bridge in the region of Buryatia,
*23:43.400- 23:44.240* :  north of Mongolia.
*23:44.660- 23:46.740* :  There's been no official comment from the Kremlin,
*23:46.740- 23:49.500* :  but Russian media say an incident is being investigated.
*23:50.100- 23:52.800* :  A correspondent, Jessica Parker, reports from Keefe.
*23:53.080- 23:55.800* :  In Russia's far east, the Baikolamur main line
*23:55.800- 23:58.360* :  is a key artery running to the border of China.
*23:58.780- 24:00.680* :  It's thousands of miles from Ukraine,
*24:00.680- 24:02.380* :  but according to a senior official,
*24:02.380- 24:04.800* :  the country's security services manage
*24:04.800- 24:08.240* :  to engineer two explosions over two days this week,
*24:08.240- 24:11.060* :  the first in a tunnel and the second on a bridge.
*24:11.060- 24:13.220* :  Russian rail authorities have confirmed
*24:13.220- 24:15.740* :  that a fire broke out on a train in a tunnel,
*24:15.740- 24:18.940* :  but suggested that it had only caused slight delays.
*24:19.580- 24:21.200* :  Nevertheless, Russian media reports
*24:21.200- 24:23.540* :  that a criminal investigation has been launched.
*24:24.040- 24:26.320* :  Ukrainian sources say the operation was designed
*24:26.320- 24:29.020* :  to disable a line that is sometimes used
*24:29.020- 24:30.260* :  for military purposes.
*24:30.800- 24:32.820* :  While the extent of the damage is unclear,
*24:33.240- 24:35.860* :  Keefe appears keen to demonstrate its ability
*24:35.860- 24:39.500* :  to strike infrastructure that lies deep within Russian territory.
*24:40.060- 24:41.180* :  Jessica Parker reporting.
*24:41.840- 24:45.500* :  More than 130 world leaders have reached a major agreement
*24:45.500- 24:47.420* :  on the future of food and farming
*24:47.420- 24:50.640* :  on the second day of the COP28 climate summit in Dubai.
*24:51.320- 24:53.760* :  It's the first time the annual United Nations gathering
*24:53.760- 24:56.500* :  has recognized that what people grow and eat
*24:56.940- 24:59.500* :  has a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions.
*25:00.200- 25:01.920* :  The conference also heard from King Charles,
*25:01.920- 25:05.080* :  who warned that the world was dreadfully far off track
*25:05.500- 25:06.800* :  in tackling global warming,
*25:07.300- 25:09.000* :  but he said he hoped the two-week summit
*25:09.000- 25:10.620* :  would be a critical turning point.
*25:10.620- 25:14.080* :  From Dubai, our climate editor Justin Rolett reports.
*25:14.640- 25:17.660* :  These COP conferences normally build momentum slowly,
*25:18.000- 25:21.180* :  but the UAE is determined this one delivers progress
*25:21.180- 25:22.540* :  from the very start.
*25:22.940- 25:25.100* :  Yesterday, a fund to help poorer countries
*25:25.100- 25:27.080* :  with climate disasters was created.
*25:27.700- 25:30.280* :  Today, the UAE promised $30 billion
*25:30.500- 25:33.140* :  to develop global climate solutions.
*25:33.140- 25:36.960* :  And more than 130 countries, including China, Brazil,
*25:36.960- 25:40.640* :  and the UK, agreed to include food and farming,
*25:41.500- 25:44.340* :  responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions
*25:44.340- 25:46.460* :  in their climate change commitments.
*25:46.960- 25:48.840* :  The pledge is short on detail,
*25:49.360- 25:53.360* :  but big on ambition, a hallmark of this UN process.
*25:53.700- 25:57.220* :  It is not enough yet to meet King Charles's prayer
*25:57.220- 26:00.740* :  that this summit proves to be a critical turning point
*26:01.140- 26:02.700* :  to transformational action.
*26:03.140- 26:04.320* :  Urging them to be ambitious,
*26:04.740- 26:06.480* :  the King asked the assembled leaders
*26:06.860- 26:08.640* :  to answer this question.
*26:08.920- 26:12.620* :  With what we are witnessing, our choice now is a starker
*26:13.280- 26:14.780* :  and darker one.
*26:15.560- 26:18.240* :  How dangerous are we actually prepared
*26:18.900- 26:19.980* :  to make our world?
*26:20.860- 26:24.200* :  And King Charles also had a warning for us all.
*26:24.640- 26:29.440* :  In 2050, our grandchildren won't be asking what we said.
*26:30.580- 26:32.080* :  They will be living with the consequences
*26:32.080- 26:34.860* :  of what we did or didn't do.
*26:36.020- 26:39.560* :  So if we act together to safeguard our precious planet,
*26:40.180- 26:42.660* :  the welfare of all our people will surely follow.
*26:42.880- 26:45.460* :  Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India was more upbeat.
*26:45.460- 26:47.640* :  He boasted about his country's efforts
*26:47.640- 26:49.000* :  to meet its climate targets
*26:49.340- 26:51.540* :  and the very low average carbon emissions
*26:51.940- 26:53.500* :  of India's vast population.
*26:53.720- 26:58.140* :  That is partly a result of the population's low average income
*26:58.140- 27:00.380* :  as the Indian Prime Minister hinted.
*27:03.240- 27:04.940* :  Over the past century, he said,
*27:05.340- 27:09.820* :  a small section of humanity had indiscriminately exploited nature.
*27:10.320- 27:12.680* :  All of humanity was paying the price for this,
*27:13.040- 27:16.040* :  especially people living in the global south.
*27:16.680- 27:21.640* :  Minister Modi said India was keen to host the COP meeting in 2028.
*27:22.000- 27:24.080* :  No doubt the UN would be delighted
*27:24.560- 27:26.780* :  to have the world's third biggest emitter
*27:27.260- 27:28.720* :  becoming more deeply involved
*27:29.240- 27:31.180* :  in promoting climate action.
*27:31.680- 27:34.280* :  Just in rollout reporting from the United Arab Emirates.
*27:35.020- 27:37.360* :  Police in South Korea are investigating the death
*27:37.360- 27:39.660* :  of a prominent but controversial monk
*27:40.100- 27:41.440* :  who'd been in charge of an order
*27:41.440- 27:43.700* :  where members were accused of drinking, gambling,
*27:44.200- 27:46.200* :  and even breaking their vow of celibacy
*27:46.200- 27:47.120* :  by having wives.
*27:47.860- 27:50.720* :  What's thought to be the remains of the venerable Jarsong
*27:51.100- 27:53.140* :  were discovered in a burnt-out dormitory
*27:53.160- 27:55.480* :  at a temple belonging to his Buddhist sect.
*27:56.000- 27:58.480* :  He'd left notes suggesting that he'd taken his own life.
*27:59.060- 28:01.740* :  I heard more from our Asia Pacific editor, Mickey Brister.
*28:02.240- 28:05.700* :  The venerable Jarsong went to one of his temples.
*28:06.120- 28:07.400* :  He went to a dormitory
*28:07.880- 28:10.660* :  and simply set himself alight
*28:10.820- 28:12.320* :  and the dormitory burnt down.
*28:12.540- 28:13.820* :  And the following day,
*28:13.820- 28:16.500* :  for Thursday, his sect his order,
*28:17.100- 28:20.260* :  the Choghye order of Buddhists in South Korea,
*28:20.880- 28:23.300* :  announced that it essentially itself emulated.
*28:23.300- 28:25.900* :  So it was kind of an abrupt ending
*28:26.520- 28:28.540* :  to what had been a very long career.
*28:28.540- 28:30.020* :  He was 69 when he died.
*28:30.020- 28:32.280* :  He'd become a monk when he was 19.
*28:32.280- 28:37.080* :  So half a century he'd been involved as a Buddhist monk.
*28:37.180- 28:39.740* :  A 50-year career as you described there.
*28:39.740- 28:42.620* :  But he became a very controversial figure, didn't he?
*28:42.620- 28:44.460* :  Because of some of the activities associated
*28:45.100- 28:46.780* :  with the sect that he was in charge of.
*28:46.940- 28:48.460* :  A very controversial figure.
*28:48.900- 28:51.160* :  He was in charge of the Choghye sect
*28:51.200- 28:53.540* :  for about eight years up until 2017.
*28:54.380- 28:55.400* :  And during that period,
*28:55.400- 28:57.700* :  there's a whole string of controversies.
*28:58.160- 29:00.300* :  A video came out which appeared to show
*29:00.300- 29:03.580* :  monks smoking, drinking and gambling.
*29:04.160- 29:08.540* :  There also suggestions of embezzling money from the order.
*29:09.220- 29:10.060* :  And other things as well.
*29:10.060- 29:11.280* :  Perhaps more seriously,
*29:11.280- 29:13.220* :  monks take a vow of celibacy.
*29:13.660- 29:15.160* :  But there were suggestions that some of them
*29:15.160- 29:16.840* :  had married and fathered children.
*29:17.560- 29:20.040* :  Also, when he stepped down the accusations
*29:20.060- 29:22.760* :  that he tried to maintain his own power
*29:22.760- 29:25.180* :  and influence by choosing his successor.
*29:25.180- 29:29.140* :  So certainly he was a great spiritual character in,
*29:29.500- 29:30.360* :  respected for that.
*29:30.380- 29:32.640* :  There was a more worldly side to him,
*29:32.900- 29:34.960* :  which a lot of people didn't think
*29:34.960- 29:36.580* :  reflected well on his character.
*29:36.940- 29:37.520* :  Mickey Brister.
*29:38.280- 29:40.760* :  The Croatian capital Zagreb has introduced
*29:40.760- 29:43.080* :  drive-in tests for hooping cough
*29:43.540- 29:46.100* :  after the country suffered a surge in the number of cases.
*29:46.760- 29:48.320* :  The increase has been blamed partly
*29:48.320- 29:50.620* :  on disinformation and anti-vaxxers.
*29:50.860- 29:51.840* :  Guy Deloni has more.
*29:52.300- 29:54.340* :  It's the most serious outbreak of hooping cough
*29:54.340- 29:56.580* :  the Croatia has seen for more than 40 years.
*29:57.020- 29:59.700* :  A normal year brings about 50 cases of the disease.
*29:59.700- 30:02.580* :  This year, they've been 1300 already.
*30:03.200- 30:05.700* :  That's prompted a rush of people to testing centers.
*30:06.200- 30:08.560* :  Cues grew too long in the capital Zagreb,
*30:08.980- 30:10.640* :  so now there's a drive-in center
*30:10.640- 30:13.880* :  with in-car tests similar to the COVID pandemic.
*30:14.560- 30:17.280* :  Health authorities hope concern sparked by the outbreak
*30:17.280- 30:20.860* :  will reverse a worrying downward trend in vaccination rates.
*30:21.160- 30:22.680* :  They blame COVID lockdowns
*30:22.720- 30:25.040* :  and anti-vaccination campaigns for the decline.
*30:25.940- 30:26.460* :  Guy Deloni.
*30:27.260- 30:28.880* :  Now we're going to end on Russia.
*30:36.960- 30:38.460* :  That's the sound of the Bolshoi Ballet,
*30:38.640- 30:40.480* :  one of the most prestigious in the world,
*30:40.480- 30:43.040* :  performing Swan Lake back in 2015.
*30:43.760- 30:45.460* :  Vladimir Urin was in charge then,
*30:45.460- 30:47.280* :  as he remained up until now.
*30:47.860- 30:49.520* :  But since he signed a petition last year,
*30:50.200- 30:52.220* :  criticizing President Putin's invasion of Ukraine,
*30:52.220- 30:53.840* :  his future has been in doubt.
*30:54.500- 30:55.720* :  Well, now he's being replaced,
*30:55.720- 30:57.460* :  as the head of the Bolshoi Theatre,
*30:57.920- 31:00.700* :  one of Russia's most prominent cultural organizations
*31:01.420- 31:02.420* :  by Valery Gageev,
*31:02.540- 31:04.940* :  a conductor and high-profile supporter of
*31:05.320- 31:05.980* :  Vladimir Putin.
*31:06.600- 31:09.040* :  A regional editor, Paul Moss, told me more.
*31:09.520- 31:10.800* :  The strange thing about this story
*31:10.800- 31:13.180* :  is the man who's had to quit at the Bolshoi
*31:13.180- 31:16.140* :  had been seen as quite loyal to Vladimir Putin.
*31:16.140- 31:17.560* :  Vladimir Urin, his name was,
*31:17.560- 31:21.380* :  he'd supported Russia's invasion of Crimea back in 2014.
*31:21.980- 31:24.420* :  He admits he actually got rid of playwrights
*31:24.420- 31:25.520* :  who opposed the invasion.
*31:25.520- 31:28.860* :  But it seems Mr. Urin has sort of changed his tune.
*31:28.860- 31:29.860* :  Because earlier this year,
*31:29.860- 31:32.260* :  he signed a petition calling for all sides
*31:32.320- 31:33.960* :  in Ukraine to stop fighting.
*31:34.620- 31:35.840* :  And a lot of people then thought
*31:35.840- 31:37.420* :  the writing was on the wall for him.
*31:37.420- 31:40.760* :  We are told he's now resigned of his own accord,
*31:40.760- 31:42.020* :  not everyone's convinced.
*31:42.020- 31:44.720* :  He's been replaced by an ultra-loyalist
*31:44.720- 31:46.540* :  for the Kremlin, Valery Gageev,
*31:46.540- 31:49.800* :  who's always supported the policies of Vladimir Putin.
*31:49.800- 31:54.300* :  In fact, he held a concert in honour of Russian military victory.
*31:54.300- 31:57.680* :  He's already the head of the St. Petersburg-Morinsky Theatre.
*31:57.680- 32:00.040* :  Now, very unusually, he's going to be in charge of
*32:00.320- 32:01.240* :  the Bolshoi as well.
*32:01.240- 32:03.560* :  The two leading drama venues of Russia
*32:04.160- 32:05.840* :  it looks like the Kremlin wants to make sure
*32:05.840- 32:07.160* :  they're both in safe hands.
*32:07.340- 32:09.680* :  All right, so he's a man with a lot on his plate now.
*32:10.440- 32:12.420* :  Would it be fair to say this isn't the first time
*32:12.420- 32:13.760* :  that something like this has happened?
*32:14.200- 32:15.820* :  No, I mean, even before the invasion,
*32:15.820- 32:19.760* :  a major theatre in Siberia put on a production of the Wagner opera
*32:19.760- 32:21.540* :  that the authorities didn't approve of,
*32:21.540- 32:23.040* :  that got the director sacked.
*32:23.480- 32:25.320* :  In fact, it's happened that the Bolshoi itself,
*32:26.080- 32:27.680* :  Alexander Malokinikov is a playwright
*32:27.680- 32:29.460* :  who criticised the war in Ukraine.
*32:29.460- 32:32.360* :  He had all his productions at the Bolshoi cancelled.
*32:32.940- 32:34.700* :  Another theatre, the Mayerhold Theatre,
*32:34.700- 32:37.360* :  had a statement issued criticising the war
*32:37.360- 32:39.340* :  and the director of that theatre was sacked.
*32:39.340- 32:41.520* :  And for anyone with a historical mind,
*32:41.520- 32:43.100* :  there's a sense of deja vu here
*32:43.100- 32:45.220* :  because there was a previous Mayerhold Theatre.
*32:45.700- 32:48.440* :  And that was closed down during Joseph Stalin's terror.
*32:49.000- 32:52.220* :  Now, authoritarian leaders who want to ensure
*32:52.220- 32:53.660* :  that their kind of influence extends
*32:53.660- 32:57.180* :  beyond mainstream politics, not a big surprise,
*32:57.180- 32:58.300* :  but why, in this instance,
*32:58.300- 33:00.720* :  the focus on attacking cultural figures
*33:00.720- 33:02.280* :  and in particular those in theatre?
*33:02.540- 33:04.200* :  Well, one thing is that theatres in Russia
*33:04.200- 33:05.920* :  are actually controlled by the government.
*33:05.920- 33:07.760* :  This is a hangover from the Soviet era.
*33:07.800- 33:10.380* :  It's the culture ministry that decides who's hired,
*33:10.760- 33:12.340* :  who's fired, what the budgets are.
*33:12.340- 33:14.180* :  So easy for them to control.
*33:14.580- 33:16.180* :  Theatre is also big in Russia.
*33:16.180- 33:17.780* :  I mean, you know, they're fiercely proud
*33:17.780- 33:19.540* :  of their writers like Chekov.
*33:20.120- 33:21.760* :  I should say this cuts both ways.
*33:21.760- 33:24.700* :  Valerie Gegev, who's just taken over at the Bolshoi,
*33:24.920- 33:26.900* :  he lost his work in Western Europe.
*33:26.900- 33:28.380* :  Lots of theatres cancelled him
*33:28.780- 33:30.660* :  when he refused to denounce the invasion.
*33:30.660- 33:32.960* :  We've seen plenty of countries drop works
*33:32.960- 33:34.240* :  by Russians in general.
*33:34.240- 33:36.000* :  I mean, in one case, we've had people
*33:36.000- 33:37.980* :  dropping Shaikovsky Swan Lake,
*33:37.980- 33:39.420* :  a decision that was controversial.
*33:40.160- 33:41.320* :  Paul Moss on the Bolshoi.
*33:43.500- 33:44.960* :  And that is all from us for now,
*33:44.960- 33:46.120* :  but there will be a new edition
*33:46.120- 33:48.000* :  of the Global News podcast later.
