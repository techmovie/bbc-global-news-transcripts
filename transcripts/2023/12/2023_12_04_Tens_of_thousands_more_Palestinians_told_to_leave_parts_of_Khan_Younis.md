*00:36.520- 00:42.340* :  who has died at the age of 100, who is he? What do you actually do? Why was he such an important

*01:26.700- 01:33.240* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Monday, the 4th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:33.860- 01:38.880* :  Israel tells tens of thousands of Palestinians to move further south as it presses ahead with
*01:38.880- 01:44.260* :  its military operations in southern Gaza. The harrowing account of Ukrainian soldier in the
*01:44.260- 01:51.040* :  bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Danipro River and the rescue operation after a volcano
*01:51.040- 01:59.940* :  eruption on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Also in this podcast, 30 years on, what happened to
*01:59.940- 02:06.920* :  the hopes of South Africans when a part eight ended? They would say, we vote, we vote, but
*02:07.580- 02:14.280* :  nothing happened to South Africa. And why two giant pandas are taking an aeroplane from
*02:22.140- 02:24.820* :  Scotland to China. But first, since the breakdown of the weeklong
*02:24.820- 02:30.360* :  truce between Israel and Hamas, the Israeli military is now concentrating its attacks on the
*02:30.360- 02:35.800* :  southern Gaza Strip. Israel has ordered the evacuation of multiple areas around the city of Khan
*02:35.800- 02:42.060* :  Unis, which is a key focus of the renewed Israeli offensive. A surgeon at a hospital in the city of
*02:42.060- 02:46.740* :  Khan Unis told the BBC that it's been overwhelmed. Hundreds of thousands of people
*02:46.740- 02:52.500* :  sought shelter in the city after fleeing fighting in the north, the focus of the initial phase
*02:52.500- 02:58.120* :  of Israel's operations. Now they're being told to move again. Israel says it's been distributing
*02:58.120- 03:04.520* :  maps online showing which areas are in danger of being attacked. Sarah Bashi is the program director
*03:04.520- 03:11.300* :  at Human Rights Watch. She says Israel is failing to protect civilians. Telling people to flee
*03:11.300- 03:17.660* :  when there's no safe place to go to, no safe way to get there. And in the case of yesterday and the
*03:17.660- 03:24.000* :  day before, utter confusion and mistakes about where they're supposed to go, that is not an effective
*03:24.000- 03:30.860* :  warning. The Israeli military put on social media QR codes, inviting people who don't have electricity
*03:30.860- 03:36.500* :  or internet to somehow scan a barcode to see where they're supposed to go. They later corrected
*03:36.500- 03:42.480* :  the maps because they were wrong. The Israeli military says it's targeting Hamas Command Center's
*03:42.480- 03:48.460* :  weapons, stores and naval forces and was taking unprecedented measures to protect civilians in
*03:48.460- 03:54.300* :  Gaza. Avi Haiman is spokesman for the Israeli government. We don't want to see any civilian
*03:54.300- 03:59.860* :  casualties on Israel side. We don't want to see any civilian casualties on the Gaza side. But
*03:59.860- 04:06.800* :  sadly, this is war and war is hell. And we are conducting this war in the most surgical possible
*04:06.800- 04:13.040* :  way. And when the dust settles and the real numbers come out, you'll find that our army has
*04:13.040- 04:20.040* :  acted in a way that is far more advanced in saving lives than any Western army ever.
*04:20.560- 04:25.200* :  Our Middle East regional editor, Sebastian Usher, told me more about the Israeli army moving
*04:25.200- 04:30.860* :  its focus to places in the south of Gaza. What we saw over the last couple of days was a
*04:30.860- 04:36.800* :  switch towards the south, is where the main focus of the ground offensive is moving. I mean, before
*04:36.800- 04:43.100* :  the troops came into effect, it was the north, of course, but was the main area that Israel first
*04:43.100- 04:49.940* :  with airstrikes and then with its ground troops was attacking Hamas targets. And we've sort of
*04:49.940- 04:55.440* :  been getting the impression that the Israeli army believes that it's achieved what it can there,
*04:55.440- 05:00.900* :  although there have still been a number of attacks in the past few days since the troops ended.
*05:00.900- 05:06.580* :  There was one on the main refugee camp there of a Jabaliyah refugee camp, which is already
*05:07.140- 05:11.480* :  in ruins parts of it. You know, there hasn't been a complete let up. I will imagine that there
*05:11.480- 05:17.820* :  will still be operations there. But as I say, the real focus now seems to be going down towards
*05:17.820- 05:23.940* :  the south, where there are many, many people struggling to feed themselves. Yes, I mean, the issue
*05:24.560- 05:29.060* :  from the Palestinian perspective, the perspective of aid agencies, is that at the start of a conflict,
*05:29.760- 05:33.840* :  people were told to head south that that's where they would be safer, that there would be zones
*05:33.840- 05:38.460* :  there, where they would be relatively safe, the safest they can be in Gaza at the moment,
*05:39.120- 05:42.900* :  from the airstrikes and then the ground offensive of Israel was carrying out. In practice,
*05:42.900- 05:48.640* :  that hasn't quite been the case even when the focus was on the north. But what we've been seeing,
*05:48.640- 05:53.660* :  what we've been hearing in the last couple of days, is that ground forces are moving further
*05:53.660- 05:59.940* :  south. We've been hearing from residents in the city of Han Yunus that there are tanks, there are
*05:59.940- 06:06.900* :  armored personnel carriers that are just nearing the city there. So, real concern for people,
*06:06.900- 06:12.680* :  hundreds of thousands who left their homes in the north, some of whom returned during the
*06:12.680- 06:18.260* :  truce, but now one assumes many of them have gone south again when the fighting started again,
*06:18.260- 06:23.280* :  and where they can go. I mean, what the Israeli army has done and, you know, we were hearing them
*06:23.860- 06:29.240* :  from a military spokesman saying that it's doing everything it can to keep the civilians as
*06:29.240- 06:33.400* :  protected as possible. And one of the things that Israel's been doing is setting up an interactive
*06:33.400- 06:39.380* :  map, which is divided guards are up into many, many small zones, and the idea is that people in
*06:39.380- 06:43.980* :  those zones will be informed by Israel when it's about to attack, and they'll get a chance
*06:44.000- 06:49.980* :  to evacuate. But there's all sorts of issues over that in terms of internet, in terms of
*06:50.240- 06:55.360* :  the electricity supply, and simply in terms of the accuracy. And finally, you know, where they
*06:55.360- 07:00.600* :  can go when they are evacuated from there. So, I mean, the issues are really redoubling again.
*07:01.000- 07:05.100* :  And new outbreaks of violence in the other Palestinian enclave the West Bank.
*07:05.500- 07:11.500* :  Yes, I mean, there have been daily raids that we've seen long before the conflict between Hamas
*07:11.500- 07:17.360* :  and Israel erupted back in October. I mean, that was really where the focus of the violence
*07:17.380- 07:22.100* :  between Israel and the Palestinians had been for almost a year and a half. We've seen a much
*07:22.100- 07:27.100* :  greater loss of life amongst Palestinians as Israel has been carrying out these military raids.
*07:27.500- 07:33.400* :  Many of them fighters, but some civilians too, today there were two Palestinians who were killed
*07:33.400- 07:42.040* :  in Calcilia as Israel mounted an operation there. So, I mean, as the situation in Gaza has heated up,
*07:42.340- 07:46.840* :  there's been a similar, they're not obviously on the same level of an intensification of what was
*07:46.840- 07:51.640* :  already underway in terms of violence in the occupied West Bank, and concerns growing all the time
*07:51.640- 07:58.120* :  that that could get more and more out of control as the situation in Gaza possibly deteriorates
*07:58.120- 08:04.440* :  further. Sebastian Usher. Human rights organizations in the Netherlands, meanwhile, are demanding
*08:04.440- 08:10.820* :  an immediate halt to the supply of weapons to Israel. Oxfam and the Dutch branch of Amnesty International,
*08:10.820- 08:17.040* :  calling on the Dutch government to stop exporting F-35 fighter jet parts, which are made in the
*08:17.040- 08:23.060* :  Netherlands saying the current situation makes it complicit in war crimes, and a polygon in the
*08:23.060- 08:28.100* :  Hague told us more about the case. It's a really interesting test case, actually. These human rights
*08:28.100- 08:33.120* :  organizations have brought a case against the Dutch state, essentially suing the Dutch state,
*08:33.120- 08:39.240* :  accusing them of potentially being complicit in violations of international humanitarian law by
*08:39.240- 08:45.820* :  allowing these exports of F-35 fighter jet spare parts from the Netherlands, and this is
*08:46.480- 08:54.980* :  its European Distribution Center of American F-35 spare parts to Israel, and this all kind of came
*08:54.980- 09:03.120* :  to light because of a report in the NRC newspaper in which the journalists found that the exports were
*09:03.400- 09:08.960* :  continuing despite the situation on the ground in Gaza. So these organizations brought the
*09:08.960- 09:13.460* :  case to court saying we want this to cease immediately, we want the judges to rule that this cannot
*09:13.460- 09:19.060* :  continue. The government has said in parliamentary questions, they're looking into the legality of
*09:19.060- 09:25.760* :  these exports. We know they have the potential to intercept exports if those exports potentially
*09:26.360- 09:33.360* :  violate Dutch foreign policy, but of course there is the political situation and any effort to stop
*09:33.820- 09:38.780* :  American exports to Israel would be very difficult for the Dutch government, so that's one of the
*09:38.780- 09:44.780* :  issues according to reports in the NRC newspaper which is creating this kind of delay. Anna
*09:44.780- 09:51.200* :  Holigen in the Hague. Last month Ukraine claimed a symbolic victory in its fight back against the
*09:51.200- 09:56.580* :  Russian invasion when its troops took ground on the eastern banks of the Denipro River, a major
*09:56.580- 10:02.480* :  front line in the war. A few hundred soldiers are continuing to dig in and President Zelensky has
*10:02.480- 10:08.540* :  been keen to talk up their modest gains, but they're outnumbered and outgunned and one soldier
*10:08.540- 10:14.680* :  who spent six weeks fighting there has told the BBC the operation is hell with no clear objective,
*10:14.680- 10:22.160* :  his testimony has been voiced up by an actor. I escaped from hell. Last time I got out after
*10:22.160- 10:27.840* :  getting concussed from a mine, but one of my colleagues didn't make it, all that was left of
*10:35.880- 10:39.580* :  him was his helmet. Every day we sat in the forest taking incoming fire, we were trapped,
*10:39.580- 10:48.500* :  the roads and paths all riddled with mines. The Russians control everything. Their drones are
*10:48.500- 10:54.660* :  constantly buzzing in the air ready to strike as soon as they see movement. Even getting there
*10:54.660- 11:01.220* :  is difficult, the entire river crossing is under constant fire. I've seen boats with my comrades
*11:01.220- 11:07.100* :  on board just disappear into the water after being hit, lost forever to the Nepro River.
*11:08.620- 11:14.740* :  Supply is the weakest link. The Russians monitor our supply lines, so it's becoming more difficult,
*11:14.740- 11:19.540* :  there's a real lack of drinking water, despite our deliveries by boat and drone.
*11:20.760- 11:25.740* :  We paid for a lot of our own kit by generators, power banks and warm clothes ourselves.
*11:25.740- 11:32.860* :  Now the frosts are coming, things will only get worse. The real situation is being hushed up,
*11:32.860- 11:38.400* :  so no one will change anything. When we arrived at the left bank, the enemy were waiting.
*11:39.100- 11:43.220* :  Russians we managed to capture said their forces were tipped off about our landing.
*11:44.140- 11:47.780* :  So when we got there they knew exactly where to find us, they threw everything at us.
*11:50.420- 11:55.040* :  Artillery, mortars and flamethrower systems. I thought I'd never get out.
*11:56.240- 12:01.540* :  There was no progress. In a month and a half we took a small bridgehead, which the officials
*12:01.540- 12:05.040* :  passed off as a breakthrough, but there was no equipment because it couldn't be transported,
*12:05.100- 12:11.900* :  so we only had people. And you won't make much progress with them. Nothing changed, we just sat there.
*12:12.520- 12:16.920* :  No one knows the goals. Many believe that the command simply abandoned us.
*12:17.640- 12:21.680* :  The guys believe that our presence had more political than military significance,
*12:22.720- 12:26.060* :  but we just did our job and didn't get into strategy.
*12:27.260- 12:32.860* :  The weather has a strong influence. Those of us who were more experienced managed to prepare
*12:32.860- 12:37.780* :  and help the others to put themselves in order. There are a lot of young guys among us.
*12:39.080- 12:43.260* :  We need people, but trained people, not the green ones we have there now.
*12:44.140- 12:48.800* :  There are guys who had spent just three weeks in training. Everyone who wanted to volunteer
*12:48.800- 12:53.800* :  for war came a long time ago. It's too hard now to tempt people with money.
*12:54.640- 13:00.640* :  Now we're getting those who didn't manage to escape the draft. We just don't have enough men.
*13:02.060- 13:07.540* :  I know guys who stayed for ten days, but there are some who are there for a month-long stretch.
*13:08.280- 13:12.920* :  If you're lucky and your commander is okay and cares about his people, if they survive,
*13:13.920- 13:18.160* :  they're rotated out. But that's if the commander is a normal person.
*13:19.120- 13:24.760* :  The guys who replaced this last time got into even more hell than us. My time to cross the river
*13:24.760- 13:31.340* :  again is soon. The testimony of a Ukrainian soldier on the front line. On Sunday, the Brazilian
*13:31.340- 13:37.380* :  President Luis Inacio Lula de Silva arrived in the German capital Berlin. He's there for the first
*13:37.380- 13:42.860* :  bilateral top-level meetings in eight years. The German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has been on a
*13:42.860- 13:48.080* :  quest to improve ties with the global south. Germany considers Brazil a key partner in its
*13:48.080- 13:54.320* :  bid to diversify trade by reducing its reliance on China and plug a gap in skilled labor.
*13:54.720- 13:59.880* :  Davina Gupta has been speaking to the political scientist Professor Guillermo Castelo Esch,
*13:59.880- 14:05.820* :  an expert in Brazilian foreign policy and international relations at the Sao Paulo School of Business.
*14:06.560- 14:12.320* :  Before Lula took office, the last official visit took place in 2015 when Chancellor Angela Merkel
*14:12.900- 14:19.960* :  met with President Jume Husef back then. She came to Brazil in mid-2015. Back then, besides
*14:19.960- 14:24.800* :  trading investments, the most important bilateral agenda related to environmental cooperation
*14:25.140- 14:31.620* :  on both bilateral and multilateral levels. But after Rousseff's impeachment in 2016, but especially
*14:31.620- 14:36.340* :  during the Bolsonaro administration, Brazilian Germany distanced themselves from one another.
*14:37.020- 14:41.980* :  On Germany's parts that were increasing ideological differences between the rolling coalition
*14:41.980- 14:48.080* :  and the SPD in particular, and the Brazilian administrations of Michel Tamé, who's a right-wing
*14:48.080- 14:55.460* :  politician, and Jai Bolsonaro, who's a far-right politician. On Brazil's part, a trade-oriented
*14:55.460- 15:00.320* :  agenda drove the country away from multilateral cooperation issues such as human rights and climate
*15:00.320- 15:05.800* :  change leading to new priority partnerships, such as the one with the United States, for example.
*15:06.160- 15:11.600* :  But with this visit, it's also significant for Germany to have relationship with Brazil.
*15:11.980- 15:16.720* :  So tell us about the common interest areas that could be on the table. What it means for both
*15:16.720- 15:22.600* :  the nations? Well, it's actually the fourth time Lula and German Chancellor all of Schultz
*15:22.600- 15:29.220* :  meets in 2023 alone. And this visit in particular is important, not just because Brazilian Germany
*15:29.220- 15:34.840* :  are the largest economies in their respective regions, but also because they are close partners
*15:34.840- 15:41.160* :  in urgent global issues like climate change and human rights. In the world that we live in today,
*15:41.160- 15:47.040* :  which is becoming increasingly dangerous, these two countries are also committed to the Security
*15:47.040- 15:52.560* :  Council reform, which is key to enable the United Nations to address ongoing conflicts in
*15:52.560- 15:57.980* :  Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. And that's the reason why Brazil, Germany,
*15:57.980- 16:04.300* :  partnership is so relevant for both countries because they're working together on a number of
*16:04.300- 16:09.800* :  different issues, and these issues are becoming more and more urgent with time. You mentioned the
*16:09.800- 16:15.040* :  continuing engagement between the German Chancellor and Lula de Silva, but there's also been a
*16:15.040- 16:21.400* :  difference of opinion because when it comes to say Russia, Ukraine, or Lula has not yet put
*16:21.400- 16:25.600* :  sanctions on Russia, it's not agreed to supply weapons to Ukraine. So there will be these
*16:25.600- 16:31.980* :  differences that will be discussed as well, one presumes. Yes, I would say that in general,
*16:31.980- 16:37.920* :  bilateral relations between Germany and Brazil are in a very good shape, especially if we compare
*16:37.920- 16:44.700* :  the state of relations before 2023. We've seen so many troubles going around between
*16:44.700- 16:50.820* :  Brazil and Germany, both on our own Merkel. They went head to head a few times on social media,
*16:50.820- 16:57.940* :  for example. So relations are in the great shape, not just because Lula has expressed his desire to
*16:58.560- 17:06.140* :  place Brazil back on the global stage, but also because both politicians are like-minded politicians
*17:06.140- 17:13.800* :  with similar positions regarding the broader values of democracy, progressive ideas, and so on
*17:13.800- 17:20.600* :  and so forth. So that's one very important aspect of the relationship. Professor Guillem Castlerosh

*17:29.720- 17:40.420* :  of its employees by nearly a fifth. Something mysterious plagues County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland,
*17:40.420- 17:45.580* :  and it's legendary Gaelic football team. I believe in the curse. Yeah, I think it's real.
*17:45.580- 17:51.100* :  Is it just superstition? Or could there be more to it? Sometimes I think there's something
*17:51.100- 17:55.180* :  sinister going on. What do we need to do to win an all-round final for Mayo?

*18:45.740- 18:50.100* :  pod you're listening to. My name is Justin Webb. I work at the BBC. I'm one of the hosts
*18:50.520- 18:57.120* :  of America. It's a podcast all about American news and politics and society, and we have literally
*18:57.780- 19:02.780* :  just come out of the studio. We recorded a really powerful episode. A lot of it's about the former
*19:02.780- 19:07.920* :  US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who has died at the age of 100, who is he? What do he
*19:07.920- 19:13.440* :  actually do? Why was he such an important figure? But also because we're the BBC, we are just
*19:13.440- 19:18.540* :  giving it to you straight to no opinions, just insight, experts, analysis. So to listen,
*19:18.540- 19:21.540* :  just search for America. Where have you got your podcasts?
*19:26.440- 19:32.100* :  A rescue effort is underway after a deadly volcano erupted on the Indonesian island of Samatra.
*19:32.480- 19:38.100* :  11 hikers have been found dead near the crater of the Marappi volcano. After lava and ash
*19:38.100- 19:43.120* :  but hundreds of meters into the air, there are fears for others still missing. Brigadier General
*19:43.120- 19:53.940* :  Reyan Obasil is leading the rescue efforts. The weather is not being friendly to us. As you can see,
*19:53.940- 19:59.640* :  there's still fog around this area, not to mention all the ash that's also here. So these are the
*19:59.640- 20:04.980* :  challenges that we're facing in this evacuation process. Our correspondent, Shima Khalil,
*20:04.980- 20:08.760* :  is monitoring developments from Bangkok. I asked her for more details.
*20:09.340- 20:14.220* :  Well, we know that the three people who were found alive near the top of the volcano that's very
*20:14.220- 20:18.940* :  close to the crater's rim. They've been rescued authorities have said that they were weak,
*20:18.940- 20:23.460* :  that they had suffered multiple burns. We also know that the volcano erupted on Sunday,
*20:23.460- 20:29.160* :  but remember there were dozens of hikers and climbers that had made their way onto the slopes
*20:29.160- 20:33.700* :  of Marappi from Saturday. We know that dozens of them are still stuck there,
*20:34.160- 20:39.680* :  but we also know that 49 have been evacuated earlier today. Many of them also suffering burns,
*20:39.680- 20:45.940* :  and it's just really, really dramatic scenes over their huge plumes of volcanic smoke rising
*20:45.940- 20:51.020* :  as high as three kilometers. I was watching footage earlier from an ambulance that was on its way
*20:51.020- 20:56.760* :  to the sea and driving through roads that were covered in ash cars on either side covered in
*20:56.760- 21:01.740* :  white dust. There were also some social media pictures that were shared of some of the climbers
*21:02.300- 21:07.180* :  with their faces covered in that white dust of ash as well. Just to also speak about the
*21:07.180- 21:11.580* :  search operation you heard it there from the authorities. They are contending against really,
*21:11.580- 21:17.480* :  really unstable and rough terrain. Twelve are still missing. We understand that the search for them
*21:17.480- 21:22.180* :  has been suspended because of the weather, but also because of a smaller eruption that has happened.
*21:22.900- 21:26.580* :  And there are warnings that the volcano eruption may not be over yet.
*21:28.080- 21:32.280* :  That's right. And remember, this has been active since January and February. There was an
*21:32.280- 21:37.240* :  eruption earlier this year, but it didn't result in any casualties. There has been a steady build-up
*21:37.240- 21:41.660* :  to what we've seen on the weekend. Right now, the authorities have issued the second highest
*21:41.660- 21:47.600* :  alert level. We know that two high congruence have been closed. Also, about 1400 people live
*21:47.600- 21:55.000* :  on the slopes of Marappi. They have been told not to get within three kilometers from the area as
*21:55.000- 22:00.620* :  the search and rescue continues, but again, in very, very difficult and complicated circumstances.
*22:00.620- 22:07.240* :  Shai Mahalil. Spotify, the world's largest music streaming platform, says it will reduce
*22:07.240- 22:13.300* :  the number of its employees by around 17%. The decision comes despite the company showing a profit
*22:13.300- 22:19.640* :  in the third quarter following price increases, growth in subscribers, and a 6% cut in staff
*22:19.640- 22:24.240* :  at the beginning of the year. Diana Bern asked, is he greenfield for more details?
*22:25.020- 22:30.580* :  In a memo sent to staff, CEO Daniel X said, slowing economic growth and rising costs were to blame
*22:30.580- 22:36.500* :  for the cuts, which he said would make Spotify a leaner company. Spotify employs about 9,000 people,
*22:36.500- 22:42.220* :  and Mr. X said substantial action to right-size our costs was needed for the company to meet its
*22:42.940- 22:47.820* :  objectives. Now, some analysts are pointing to the fact that Spotify has invested heavily in
*22:47.820- 22:52.780* :  podcasting, has not actually had any impact on its financial performance.
*22:53.060- 22:57.040* :  Yes, so Spotify has spent a lot of money on growing the business since it launched,
*22:57.580- 23:02.580* :  and on securing exclusive content such as podcast created by the likes of Michelle and Barack
*23:02.580- 23:07.940* :  Obama, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The deal with Harry and Meghan cost a reported
*23:07.940- 23:14.300* :  $25 million, and saw just 12 episodes delivered over two and a half years before the deal ended in June.
*23:14.840- 23:19.660* :  Spotify's Chief Executive told the BBC in September that some podcast content has worked,
*23:19.660- 23:25.320* :  but some of it hasn't. Yes, very diplomatic there. Daniel Eck, the CEO, he says,
*23:25.320- 23:29.480* :  the company is taking steps to become more efficient. What are those steps, is he?
*23:29.660- 23:35.660* :  In its latest results, Spotify reported a profit of $65 million for the three months to September.
*23:36.080- 23:39.860* :  Its first quarterly profit for more than a year. Given these positive results,
*23:39.860- 23:44.520* :  the job cuts might seem quite extreme, but the Chief Executive has decided that more drastic
*23:44.520- 23:49.400* :  action is needed to improve the company's finances. Spotify has also been making moves to
*23:49.400- 23:54.020* :  increase revenue, raising prices of several of its plans across multiple markets over the summer.
*23:54.580- 24:01.940* :  The BBC's Izzy Greenfield. 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela and FW Declurek were awarded the Nobel
*24:01.940- 24:07.980* :  Peace Prize for peacefully ending the apartheid regime. It was just four months before Mr Mandela's
*24:07.980- 24:13.540* :  African National Congress won the first democratic elections, and he pledged that all South
*24:13.540- 24:19.360* :  Africans could be children of paradise. But now, blamed for widespread corruption and failing
*24:19.360- 24:25.900* :  public services, the ANC faces a major challenge in elections next year. Our special correspondent
*24:25.900- 24:31.100* :  Fergal Keane has been back to South Africa to meet a family whose story he first reported
*24:31.640- 24:37.600* :  in 1993. I feel very ashamed. You can see yourself by even what a place to sleep.
*24:38.760- 24:45.880* :  I also sleep with a small children's outside, yeah. Because I'm suffering. I'm suffering because I'm
*24:45.880- 24:51.760* :  black. The voice of Cynthia and Tebe are 30 years ago. When I first met her in a squatter camp
*24:51.760- 24:58.000* :  at Tanbisa on the stony felt between Johannesburg and Pretoria. The future must change.
*24:59.780- 25:06.260* :  We want to be the same like white people. We must be the same. In 1993,
*25:06.260- 25:13.020* :  Cynthia and her children lived under a plastic sheet held up by sticks. She buried it in daytime,
*25:13.020- 25:19.640* :  fearing demolition by the authorities. But Cynthia had hope, and the first three elections,
*25:19.640- 25:25.440* :  the following year, promised great change. I can see black fists being raised in the air,
*25:25.900- 25:31.980* :  and people cheering this end of an old order, the end of the order of racial discrimination
*25:32.060- 25:36.080* :  of segregation. The end of the age of pain and humiliation.
*25:36.380- 25:41.140* :  30 years after witnessing the death of apartheid, I'm back in Tanbisa.
*25:46.360- 25:52.260* :  I've arranged to meet Cynthia and Tebe's daughter Doris in a place notorious for violent crime,
*25:53.020- 25:59.360* :  not helped by frequent power blackouts, as critical infrastructure fails, and where unemployment
*25:59.360- 26:08.120* :  is over 30%. You know, life in South Africa, when I look at life, it's war. You have to be strong,
*26:08.120- 26:14.760* :  life in South Africa. It's not easy. The other big thing, which we read about all the time,
*26:14.760- 26:20.920* :  is about corruption, eating away the money in government, so that you have no services or very
*26:20.920- 26:26.880* :  court services. Corruption is too much. Look at our street. There's no street lights.
*26:26.880- 26:29.760* :  I'm telling you, this place is not a nice place to lose.
*26:34.760- 26:40.740* :  Billions have been looted from public funds under ANC rule. With elections looming next year,
*26:40.740- 26:46.300* :  and party supports slipping, the ANC often blames the legacy of apartheid inequality,
*26:46.300- 26:52.000* :  and argues that it's created a welfare system, built millions of houses, put many more children
*26:52.000- 26:58.080* :  into education. I'm Franz Morco. I'm still leading in the structures of the A&C.
*26:58.720- 27:04.000* :  As a long-term ANC activist and representative in this township,
*27:05.280- 27:10.940* :  do you feel ashamed of the corruption that your party has presided over?
*27:12.020- 27:19.500* :  Unfortunately, some of them, along the way, they resort to very bad things. Am I proud that they
*27:19.500- 27:27.940* :  have happened? No, I'm not. Of course, I'm not. We are taking very radical measures in addressing those
*27:27.940- 27:34.600* :  things. And I'm not being arrogant, but let's check post-the elections next year, because
*27:34.600- 27:38.820* :  fruckets are a very understanding social act.
*27:41.040- 27:45.600* :  I wondered what Cynthia M. Tebe thought of all this, the woman who struggled
*27:45.600- 27:53.700* :  I witnessed 30 years ago in a squatter camp. How are you? I'm still alive. You're still alive.
*27:53.700- 28:00.360* :  You're very alive. You're looking beautiful. So lovely. It's okay. My problem, my
*28:00.360- 28:07.680* :  can't see again. I'm blind. But you're smiling. In a rural area, several
*28:07.680- 28:14.640* :  hours drive north of Tembisa, Cynthia M. Tebe lives now in a simple brick house built by her children.
*28:15.280- 28:21.080* :  Cynthia, when I first met you back in 1993, you were hoping for a country where you would be
*28:21.080- 28:27.600* :  equal to the white people. Do you feel that you have, that you are equal now? Never.
*28:27.600- 28:40.580* :  People are suffering, they will say, vote, vote, vote, we vote, but nothing happened to South Africa.
*28:41.660- 28:48.120* :  Why do you think things haven't worked? As long as his pocket can full up with money,
*28:48.700- 28:54.080* :  not you other people, no. Corruption in other words. I'm old now,
*28:55.200- 29:01.680* :  77 years. I just go to the church and pray every time. That's all.
*29:03.300- 29:07.480* :  Cynthia and Tebe ending that report by Fergal Kean in South Africa.
*29:08.680- 29:14.380* :  Britain's only giant pandas, Tian Tian and Yangguan are on their way back to China after
*29:14.820- 29:18.840* :  spending the last 12 years at Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland where they've been on loan.
*29:18.860- 29:25.400* :  Three other giant pandas also left the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington DC last month to spend
*29:25.400- 29:30.340* :  their dotage in China. Our Scotland correspondent Alex McKenzie reports.
*29:36.400- 29:42.040* :  A final farewell, Edinburgh Zoo has been home to the pandas for more than a decade.
*29:42.800- 29:48.760* :  At the weekend, staff help them to acclimatise to these crates, which will be used to help
*29:48.760- 29:56.260* :  transport the animals back to China. Staff at the zoo became attached to the giant pandas
*29:56.640- 30:01.860* :  and their very different personalities and say their departure will be emotional.
*30:02.740- 30:08.820* :  Some have looked after them since they arrived and will travel with them on their return plane
*30:08.820- 30:13.560* :  journey. It's been up and down, there's been stressful times over there the past 12 years,
*30:13.660- 30:19.720* :  but we've all taken to it in very good spirits. We've all had a great time doing it. I think it will be
*30:19.720- 30:25.700* :  such a change to our lives, to our day without them being here and it will definitely be sad and
*30:25.700- 30:32.900* :  definitely get some you get used to kind of fitting into our new normalies without without them being
*30:32.900- 30:38.940* :  here. While in Scotland, there were eight attempts at artificial insemination between the pair,
*30:38.940- 30:46.420* :  but Yanguan and Chen Chen return home having failed to produce a cub. Staff say they will be
*30:46.420- 30:52.060* :  closely monitored while aboard the plane. During the flight, I'm not expecting to have major
*30:52.320- 30:59.000* :  major challenges. Yanguan and Tian Tian are healthy, so my plan is to feed them plenty of bamboo
*30:59.660- 31:04.640* :  throughout the flight. I will monitor them very closely of course and they will also have one of
*31:04.640- 31:09.900* :  their favourite keepers with them, so they should be happy. The official handover of the two
*31:09.900- 31:16.420* :  pandas will take place halfway between Scotland and China. A zookeeper will hand over the keys
*31:16.420- 31:22.120* :  to the crates, officially ending their time at Edinburgh Zoo. Alex McKenzie
*31:24.980- 31:30.360* :  and that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
