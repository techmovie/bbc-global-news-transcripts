*01:12.360- 01:17.200* :  This week you're joining us at the United Nations Global Refugee Forum in Geneva
*01:17.200- 01:22.040* :  for a special edition of the Happy Pod. We're putting aside the politics of migration
*01:22.040- 01:26.260* :  and choosing instead to hear from the people at the heart of these journeys.
*01:26.260- 01:31.180* :  Extraordinary men and women who fled their homes in search of what everyone wants.
*01:31.500- 01:35.040* :  A place where they'll be safe from war, violence and persecution,
*01:35.600- 01:37.660* :  and have a chance to build a positive future.
*01:43.740- 01:49.360* :  Hello, I'm Harry Bly. In this edition, the Somalian man who returned to his Kenyan refugee camp
*01:49.760- 01:55.960* :  to enable children to read and learn. Books open doors, books educate you,
*01:56.560- 02:02.340* :  books gives you opportunity, books are passport-like. A fascination with electricity which inspired
*02:02.340- 02:08.020* :  a young Congolese girl to study engineering and go on to create a robotic arm to help doctors
*02:08.020- 02:12.900* :  and nurses take blood from patients. When we got to South Africa, I noticed those like,
*02:12.920- 02:20.160* :  whoa, these lights. And I was always curious on how can that happen? Can I also do that?
*02:21.100- 02:24.940* :  And meet the woman who became an Olympic cyclist after fleeing Afghanistan.
*02:25.600- 02:29.180* :  Now she's her team's chief at the Paris Games in 2024.
*02:29.500- 02:34.260* :  The day when I had my race, I see that all the dreams are real estate.
*02:34.980- 02:39.160* :  Just we have to trust on it, to believe on it, and to work for it.
*02:40.060- 02:43.860* :  All that and more to come on the happy pot from the BBC World Service.
*02:49.300- 02:53.080* :  Let's start by introducing you to Somalian born Abdelahi Mire.
*02:53.580- 02:59.120* :  When he was just three, his family fled the war, seeking sanctuary at the Dada refugee camp in Kenya.
*02:59.780- 03:04.700* :  Later, Abdelahi was welcomed to set up home in Norway where he studied to become a journalist.
*03:04.700- 03:09.400* :  And then he returned to Kenya, where he set up the Refugee Youth Education Hub.
*03:09.400- 03:14.440* :  This project provides books to children in the Dada refugee camp, where he grew up.
*03:14.440- 03:20.740* :  And since 2017, it has distributed more than 100,000 books and opened three libraries.
*03:21.440- 03:27.480* :  Now, at 36 years old, Abdelahi is this year's winner of the UNHCR's Nansen Refugee Award.
*03:30.780- 03:36.800* :  I want to thank this award to every child from my country, Somalia, from Afghanistan,
*03:36.800- 03:45.360* :  to Venezuela, from Miami, to Middle East, from Congo, to Central America,
*03:46.540- 03:54.440* :  who has been scooped up in some one's arm as they ran, because anywhere was safer than here.
*03:54.660- 04:00.580* :  Because you deserve an education and the opportunity to be the author of your own future.
*04:01.140- 04:04.780* :  I spoke to Abdelahi Mire to find out what inspired him.
*04:05.080- 04:09.660* :  In my country, the Mayhem, the war going on, is just because of electricity.
*04:10.880- 04:18.420* :  Books open doors, books educate you, books gives you opportunity, books are passport-like.
*04:19.140- 04:24.260* :  To me, to give education is the only thing that can change generations in the refugee camp.
*04:25.820- 04:28.860* :  And you're not a multi-millionaire philanthropist.
*04:28.920- 04:32.100* :  So how did you set up this charity, this project?
*04:32.800- 04:34.620* :  I am not, but I have a heart.
*04:35.620- 04:40.060* :  And once you have a heart, you believe strongly what you do, you can do it.
*04:41.260- 04:44.540* :  I am a journalist, a social media platform is an amazing.
*04:44.540- 04:47.860* :  As you know, I use social media to talk to people.
*04:48.300- 04:50.900* :  I just amplify the need and the response come.
*04:51.720- 04:58.780* :  You've supplied over 100,000 books to refugees in Dadaab and opened three libraries.
*04:59.420- 05:02.240* :  Can you tell me about some of the children that you've helped?
*05:03.060- 05:04.440* :  I'm inspired by many children.
*05:05.020- 05:10.460* :  Every day I go to my libraries, I go to the libraries of the community, I go to schools,
*05:10.460- 05:15.680* :  I'm inspired, the thousands, but there was one that was calling, appealing.
*05:16.240- 05:22.020* :  One day before I started book drive, and this lady avoided me with courage, she wanted a book.
*05:22.600- 05:26.360* :  When I met her, she wanted a biology book, I bought her a few biology books.
*05:27.180- 05:33.080* :  Today, she is on her way to be a doctor, she's a nurse, helping the same community that she
*05:33.080- 05:39.880* :  belonged to. A single book, a single student need, and now at this stage, that's how the
*05:39.880- 05:45.500* :  journey started. It's been announced that you are the winner of the UN High Commission for
*05:45.500- 05:51.280* :  Refugees, Nansen Award. Can you describe to me the moment that you found out you won?
*05:52.060- 06:00.280* :  Oh, it was really huge. I was humbled, happy, not for myself, for my mother, for everybody.
*06:01.340- 06:06.600* :  This is a communal work, for all the community, for all the people who trusted me with the books.
*06:07.260- 06:12.960* :  This, to me, brings ability, more books. Hopefully next year we'll talk about millions of books,
*06:13.700- 06:18.500* :  not only Kenya, but for the region of Africa, and for the globe. This is a small world,
*06:18.500- 06:26.620* :  and a book cannot bend us for many, many revigies. Anytime a book, whether it's 10,000 or 15,000,
*06:26.620- 06:33.680* :  it's just a book. To me, one page is big, a whole book is huge, so the moment I put a book in the
*06:33.680- 06:38.000* :  hand of a child, that's my happiest moment, that's my highest moment.
*06:38.680- 06:43.520* :  Abdelahi Mide, this year's UNHCR, Nansen Refugee Award, Global Laureate.
*06:45.300- 06:50.760* :  Our next story comes from 25-year-old Bernice Kula Kula. She was forced to flee the Democratic
*06:50.760- 06:55.540* :  Republic of Congo with her mother and brother when she was a child. Despite language barriers
*06:55.540- 07:00.460* :  and financial hardships, Bernice's determination and passion for education never wavered.
*07:00.960- 07:04.840* :  Now she lives in Italy, where she's studying for a master's in computer engineering,
*07:04.840- 07:09.560* :  cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Previously, she studied engineering,
*07:09.560- 07:14.600* :  and her final research project on a robotic arm was designed to help healthcare professionals
*07:14.600- 07:17.620* :  withdraw blood. Let's hear her story.
*07:18.120- 07:23.020* :  I've been a refugee almost all my life, but the one thing that I remember is the fact that
*07:23.020- 07:28.840* :  there was no electricity, and that's what's actually led me to study electrical engineering.
*07:29.700- 07:34.580* :  Being born in Congo, you know, as a child, there's no electricity, you know, just playing around
*07:34.580- 07:39.340* :  with whatever you can, like the stones, the mud, whatever. But when we got to South Africa,
*07:39.800- 07:46.580* :  I noticed those like, whoa, these lights, and I was always curious on how can that happen?
*07:47.640- 07:54.640* :  Can I also do that? And that's what led me into the interest within electrical engineering,
*07:54.740- 07:59.500* :  that's why I went and I was like, you know what, I have to know how to do this. She said,
*07:59.500- 08:05.420* :  if one day I can go back home, if one day I can bring electricity in areas where there is no
*08:05.420- 08:13.600* :  electricity, I'd want to do that. Your final research project was a robotic arm designed for blood
*08:13.600- 08:19.940* :  withdrawal. Tell me about that. Blood withdrawal is very important, and the thing is that people
*08:19.940- 08:25.760* :  have different colors, different shapes, different sizes that babies wear. It's difficult for doctors
*08:25.760- 08:31.520* :  or nurses to find veins, and helping people has been always one thing that I've always wanted to do.
*08:31.920- 08:37.320* :  And I found that if I could create something that would make life easier for doctors and nurses,
*08:37.320- 08:42.300* :  because they already go through a lot, trying to save people's lives. Now imagine you are
*08:42.300- 08:48.060* :  losing someone and you cannot find the vein. So that was one of the things that led me and my friend
*08:48.060- 08:56.200* :  to want to build something that will help nurses and doctors find vein through NIR, which is near
*08:56.200- 09:02.960* :  infrared light. So how it works is that it would show you where the veins are within a screen,
*09:02.960- 09:08.020* :  and then from there you'll be able to put your needle exactly where the vein is.
*09:08.680- 09:14.900* :  And your mum was a nurse. Is she your inspiration? She has always been my inspiration. She's actually
*09:14.900- 09:22.760* :  my role model because growing up in South Africa, it was not easy, but she always advocated about
*09:22.760- 09:28.700* :  education. When we got to South Africa, she literally went from school to school, pleaded with
*09:28.700- 09:36.240* :  principles to get us into education. And I would say I am here where I am today because of her.
*09:36.420- 09:43.280* :  And if I can stand here at GRF and advocates about education about how important it is for girls
*09:43.280- 09:49.380* :  or for refugees to be in higher level education, I would say it's because someone inspired me and
*09:49.380- 09:54.420* :  that person is my mum. And your robot arm, are you going to still work on that? Or have you got
*09:54.420- 09:58.860* :  other projects that you're concentrating on now? Well, there's just a lot of things that's just
*09:58.860- 10:05.260* :  coming to my mind. But that's actually one thing that I'll definitely want to improve. And one of my
*10:05.260- 10:12.740* :  biggest project is finding ways for you refugees to get education. That's why being a panelist
*10:12.740- 10:18.440* :  yesterday was a way for me to speak. And my voice is not only for me alone, but also for those
*10:18.980- 10:24.260* :  that cannot speak for themselves, for those talents that refugee have, but hidden because they do
*10:24.260- 10:30.280* :  not have the finances, but hidden because they're in places or situations where they cannot find
*10:30.280- 10:35.840* :  education. And refugees are not only a burden, but they can also contribute. They can also
*10:35.840- 10:42.800* :  better the world. That's one of my biggest projects. I will carry on doing it. Even when I'm
*10:42.800- 10:48.480* :  done with school, I will do it until refugees get to the point where I am because it's a privilege
*10:48.480- 10:53.480* :  for me to be where I am and I'm grateful for that. So I have to open ways for others as well.
*10:54.080- 11:01.120* :  And what is your message to young refugees and to women who aspire to work in tech or in
*11:01.440- 11:07.140* :  computers or in engineering? As long as you're alive, you can do it. As long as you breathe,
*11:07.140- 11:13.360* :  you can do it. Nothing can stop you. Of course, it won't be easy. You'll definitely fail somewhere.
*11:13.360- 11:19.820* :  You'll definitely fall. But the important thing is get up. Get up and try again until you make it.
*11:20.060- 11:24.560* :  You will definitely make it. Nothing will stop you. The only thing you have to know that is work
*11:24.560- 11:29.960* :  hard put in as much time as you can. And my high school motto was that nothing was too difficult
*11:29.960- 11:35.840* :  for the brave. I always keep it in my head. So nothing is too difficult for you. Refugee, young girl,
*11:36.240- 11:41.840* :  refugee woman. Know that the world is out there and you have a purpose on this life. Cause with
*11:41.840- 11:47.700* :  refugees, struggling with identity is something that can really bring bring you down. I've been there.
*11:47.700- 11:52.660* :  I know how it feels like, but don't let that bring you down. You have a purpose. And for you coming
*11:52.660- 11:57.740* :  into tech, tech is a beautiful space. You'll be able to create the feature that you want. You'll be
*11:57.740- 12:03.780* :  able to create something that you know will help not only you, but others around you. So please
*12:03.780- 12:08.340* :  do come in. Don't give up. I know it's hard at times, but you'll definitely make it.
*12:08.860- 12:14.980* :  Bernice Kula Kula. Waheed Aryan's childhood and teenage years were marked by anxiety and nightmares,
*12:14.980- 12:21.060* :  traumatized by a life of surviving war in Afghanistan. He found a safe haven in the United Kingdom.
*12:21.620- 12:27.140* :  Now he's an emergency doctor on a mission to heal the war-related trauma faced by those who are in
*12:27.140- 12:34.860* :  or who have fled conflict zones using technology. I came to the UK in 99 as a child refugee after
*12:34.860- 12:41.320* :  spending nearly a decade in the civil war in Afghanistan. Most of my education happened with a lamp
*12:41.320- 12:46.820* :  and any books that I could find from the streets in Kabul, science, maths, whatever they were.
*12:47.280- 12:52.740* :  From time to time, I would listen to BBC World actually. When my father would tune into the
*12:52.740- 12:58.100* :  push to the version I would tune into the English to learn a few words and get some inspiration
*12:58.160- 13:04.580* :  from what people were doing outside what we were really consumed by which was war. So this was
*13:04.580- 13:10.260* :  imaginary world that I couldn't reach, but I couldn't listen to. And that was my vision to go
*13:10.260- 13:16.120* :  somewhere to be able to heal my traumas, but also to do something for the future of other people.
*13:16.860- 13:23.720* :  In the UK, when I started my new life as a refugee age 15, I came in with a lot of determination.
*13:24.440- 13:30.240* :  I saw the opportunities that I never had. Simple opportunities like being able to go to school,
*13:30.240- 13:35.460* :  being able to look into the sky without being attacked and also being able to
*13:35.960- 13:40.700* :  smile at people on the streets. So that was for me a moment of pure joy.
*13:41.900- 13:46.960* :  I carried on with my life, continued to work and study eventually, I got into Cambridge University
*13:46.960- 13:53.680* :  to study medicine. And it wouldn't be for nearly 8 to 10 years until I found out that actually
*13:53.680- 14:00.280* :  I had something wrong with me, which was PTSD. So I had to go and find help for myself through
*14:00.280- 14:07.720* :  a psychologist. But all this time, what was keeping my head above the water, which I believe was
*14:07.720- 14:15.500* :  exercise. So I was running, I was doing martial arts as a child. And the two psychological therapy
*14:15.500- 14:21.700* :  exercise, which I did for myself, have got evidence based to it. And they've become the core
*14:21.700- 14:28.420* :  foundation of aeronol being. And aeronol being is rolled out not just in the UK, but to
*14:28.420- 14:33.940* :  water on countries as well. So aeronol being provides psychological therapies and exercise.
*14:33.940- 14:41.060* :  It's an overtive digital solution and in person to everyone, including refugees,
*14:41.060- 14:47.600* :  homeless and other heart-reached populations. We provide that service through our psychologist,
*14:47.600- 14:54.100* :  therapist and personal trainers. Our service has got a charitable arm. The charitable arm works
*14:54.100- 14:59.580* :  through teleheal internationally as well as with nonprofits. So we have provided mental
*14:59.580- 15:05.580* :  support to clinicians in Afghanistan. We have also provided that support to other humanitarians
*15:05.580- 15:11.520* :  who work with refugees to support their own mental traumas. So ultimately the big vision for
*15:12.540- 15:17.460* :  aeronol being is that for people to be able to click a button wherever they are in the world,
*15:17.460- 15:24.380* :  whether it's Gaza, whether it's Syria or whether it's part of the UK or US. And they can find
*15:24.380- 15:29.380* :  a psychologist or therapist that can speak their language and they can connect immediately and
*15:29.380- 15:34.920* :  help them. And could you describe to me how easy it is to use this service? Let's say I'm
*15:35.380- 15:38.760* :  in a different country and I want to use your service. Take me through how it would work.
*15:40.000- 15:45.940* :  So at present, if you're in another country, it's a peer-to-peer support system. So a clinician can
*15:45.940- 15:49.900* :  get in touch with one of our psychologists and we can support them either their mental health
*15:50.640- 15:56.520* :  or we can provide them some tips and ideas how to support people in their care with their mental
*15:56.520- 16:04.000* :  health. So that capacity building arm of our aeronol being is active. It works virtually using
*16:04.000- 16:11.720* :  simple platforms like Zoom, like Teams. Whereas in the UK, besides supporting clinicians,
*16:11.860- 16:19.180* :  we provide direct one-to-one service to people in need. So in the future, we're hoping to extend
*16:19.180- 16:24.320* :  that one-to-one service for everyone around the globe and we're taking those steps towards that
*16:24.320- 16:30.120* :  vision. This service from its conception to now, are there any moments that really stand out to
*16:30.120- 16:40.360* :  you as a doctor? There are many moments. One was me walking in Chester City with my family and I
*16:40.360- 16:46.440* :  saw this other family, Afghan family, who we'd provide support for. They came and we mangled with
*16:46.440- 16:52.640* :  each other. We had a chat and the children were doing high-fiving with me saying hello doc, how are
*16:52.640- 16:58.160* :  you? And they were telling me what they were up to today and I think that was amazing because
*16:58.160- 17:05.700* :  usually their minds are so consumed by one challenge after another, whether it's food, whether it's
*17:05.800- 17:11.800* :  school, whether it's house, that they'd never think that they are actually out and about
*17:11.800- 17:17.040* :  doing something with their lives, which is what this service is about, to give me an opportunity to
*17:17.040- 17:24.520* :  live freely, to be able to cope with their traumas and then also enjoy moments in life. I'm coming
*17:24.520- 17:30.480* :  back to the main point is that we try to reduce stigma. We culturally appropriate and these are
*17:30.480- 17:36.120* :  very important when it comes to mental health. We can't come up with one solution that is designed
*17:36.120- 17:40.940* :  in one culture and take it on another culture. Yes, we can, but we really have to make sure it's
*17:40.940- 17:47.500* :  adaptable. It's not one-size-fits-all approach. So that's the gap in the mental health crisis that a
*17:47.500- 17:52.960* :  lot of the existing private and unprivate solutions are based on one method or based in one culture
*17:53.420- 17:58.460* :  and it's difficult for them to be extrapolated to other cultures or take them to other regions
*17:59.040- 18:02.720* :  and hopefully we can do that around the globe. Dr. Waheed Arian
*18:08.180- 18:14.660* :  Coming up in this podcast, Meet Santos. He broadcasts on Reff FM, a radio station run by and
*18:14.660- 18:20.100* :  four refugees across Africa. This is Santos Mediu. You are listening to the happy
*18:20.100- 18:30.780* :  port on the BBC World Service. Santos Mediu is originally from South Sudan, but as a child,
*18:30.780- 18:35.760* :  the civil war there separated him from his parents and he arrived at the Kokuma Camp in Kenya
*18:35.760- 18:42.080* :  on his own. Santos found his voice when he began working for Reff FM, a radio station run by and
*18:42.080- 18:48.120* :  four refugees. Reff FM airs in camps across several African countries. During the week,
*18:48.120- 18:53.860* :  Santos reads the news and presents a football program on Saturdays. Santos took us behind the scenes
*18:53.860- 18:54.840* :  of his new life.
*19:08.820- 19:13.940* :  The news that we do there generally are news that concern the people that are living within the
*19:13.940- 19:19.160* :  come and also the host community there. But as a person I love telling stories of resilience,
*19:19.260- 19:24.520* :  stories that can inspire refugees there because these are people that have left the home
*19:24.520- 19:31.480* :  countries after facing so many bad things. But if some of them made it to be able to do some other
*19:31.480- 19:37.360* :  good thing, these are the stories that I go for until other fellow refugees that even if you are
*19:37.360- 19:45.020* :  away from home, you can also succeed in life by maybe practicing agriculture and going to school,
*19:45.080- 19:50.300* :  graduating, becoming a teacher or still follow your career that you want to be. Then just sitting in
*19:50.300- 19:56.680* :  one place saying you cannot do anything as a refugee, you can also be like any other person you can
*19:56.680- 20:03.280* :  do something else. And I can tell that you're really passionate about radio and about broadcasting.
*20:03.880- 20:06.440* :  What is it that makes you happy about having that platform?
*20:07.640- 20:14.140* :  Having that chance, I was speaking to my community, the refugee community, I really feel at home.
*20:14.560- 20:20.400* :  I feel like I really have a sense of belonging and it's something that I'm proud of each day.
*20:21.380- 20:27.100* :  And as well as news, as well as storytelling, you also present a football program as well. Tell me
*20:27.100- 20:33.700* :  about that. It's exciting when I'm doing football stories there because the sport is one of the
*20:33.700- 20:40.480* :  platforms that is being used at the refugee camp to promote unity and to fight other crime like
*20:41.400- 20:49.040* :  violence. So people use sport and me coming there to cover stories there, it's given me a way of
*20:49.040- 20:53.800* :  communicating and reaching more people because it's also promoting the talent. We have some of the
*20:53.800- 21:00.340* :  refugees that have moved out of the camp because of football. Football to me means unity, it also means
*21:01.660- 21:09.620* :  peace and football is life. Why is it important for you to have this platform? What do you hope to achieve
*21:09.620- 21:18.560* :  with it? Our main goal is to give refugee a sense of belonging and feel like they're also part of
*21:18.560- 21:24.900* :  the community. We have lived in many years back where refugees don't even work. They are isolated
*21:24.900- 21:30.480* :  in one place, they cannot move one place to another. But now having that radio station that
*21:30.480- 21:37.740* :  involved as refugees at equal table with the host community, we feel like it's just in the home.
*21:40.160- 21:45.140* :  Now it's my pleasure to introduce you to the 27-year-old Massama Alizada from Afghanistan.
*21:45.220- 21:50.860* :  Like many of us, she learned how to ride a bike as a child. Unlike many of us, she dreamed of
*21:50.860- 21:55.980* :  cycling all the way to the Olympics. But the odds were against her. Born in a conservative
*21:55.980- 22:01.740* :  community that frowned on girls riding bicycles, she became the target of threats. So she made the
*22:01.740- 22:07.220* :  difficult decision to leave her home and ask for asylum in France. That decision paid off,
*22:07.320- 22:12.640* :  and her dream has become a reality as a member of the refugee Olympic team. She competed in Tokyo
*22:12.640- 22:18.520* :  in 2021, and if that wasn't enough, she's just been named the chef de Michel, the person in charge
*22:18.520- 22:25.000* :  of her team, at next year's Games in Paris. I spoke to Massama about her cycling journey starting
*22:25.000- 22:37.200* :  with that first race in Tokyo. During my race, I thought about all the challenges that I had,
*22:37.620- 22:44.680* :  and I had a dream to present the Olympic Games, but I didn't sure if it will be possible to
*22:44.680- 22:51.840* :  realize my dream. But with the day when I had my race, I see that all the dreams are real as I
*22:52.480- 22:56.740* :  just we have to trust on it, to believe on it, and to work for it.
*22:57.720- 23:01.560* :  To you as a refugee, how important was sport?
*23:02.820- 23:09.740* :  The my life, my story, and my experience in the Olympic Games all shows how a sport impact
*23:09.740- 23:15.580* :  in the life of refugees, and as a woman that I was in Afghanistan in a country that
*23:15.580- 23:25.400* :  while cycling was prohibited. But now I'm in France, I study, I am Chef Demission for a team
*23:26.180- 23:34.020* :  by the name of a refugee Olympic team that represents hope and peace. So all of this happens
*23:34.020- 23:40.180* :  through a sport. It changed my life, and I think most of the refugees like me that
*23:40.180- 23:46.080* :  it's a sport in their life in a different way. And the first refugee Olympic team
*23:46.080- 23:52.380* :  participate in the Olympic Games in 2016 Rio, and every Olympic Games they try to support
*23:52.380- 23:56.160* :  more refugee athletes and to give them a new life.
*23:57.080- 24:01.680* :  You've been made the Chef Demission for the team for the refugee Olympic team.
*24:01.680- 24:04.520* :  What was that moment like when you found out that news?
*24:05.640- 24:14.340* :  I was surprised, so much honoured and happy, and I have a lot of hope that I could be useful
*24:14.420- 24:21.700* :  for their athletes to help them, and to be an inspiration for them, and I hope that all the
*24:21.700- 24:28.860* :  refugees have access to sport. Being a female athlete from Afghanistan, what your hopes for the future
*24:29.300- 24:37.300* :  friends back home in Afghanistan? It's a dream for all refugees that one day their country
*24:38.080- 24:43.800* :  be free, be on peace, and they could return to their country, to work for their country,
*24:44.700- 24:50.900* :  to represent their country, and it's the same hope for me. But for now I have a hope for
*24:50.900- 24:57.200* :  the women who, again, are still in Afghanistan, that they could give their rights back.
*24:58.300- 25:01.180* :  And what's next for you after this, but what are your ambitions?
*25:02.040- 25:08.400* :  I really like to work for the sport, for the refugees, because I'm a student and a master
*25:08.400- 25:14.760* :  to urban engineering, so I really like to find a relation between urban engineering,
*25:14.760- 25:19.760* :  refugees and sport. Cyclist Anne Chef Demission for the Paris 2024
*25:19.780- 25:26.620* :  Refugee Olympic Team Massana Alizada. Let's end this edition with some music that was
*25:26.620- 25:30.740* :  performed at the Nansen Refugee Awards that we heard about at the beginning of this episode.
*25:37.280- 25:49.720* :  I made up my mind to the when the sun grows down, it's time to break. This is the Japanese singer-songwriter
*25:49.720- 25:56.380* :  and guitarist Miyavi, with his song Long Nights. It was inspired by his visits with refugees and
*25:56.380- 26:01.960* :  camps across the world. When watching this performance live, Miyavi is wearing a multicolored cloak,
*26:02.400- 26:05.840* :  made up of different coloured fabric patches sewn delicately together.
*26:08.040- 26:13.440* :  We're now going through a dark time. We might not see the light of hope in front of us,
*26:14.460- 26:20.820* :  but as long as we can believe that tomorrow will come, we can get through Long Nights.
*26:28.760- 26:33.540* :  With the words Hope and Home embroidered on the back, in the languages of all the refugees who
*26:33.540- 26:38.560* :  helped put the cloak together. This edition was mixed by Volodymyr Maseechka. It was produced
*26:38.560- 26:44.760* :  by Anna Murphy. The editor is Karen Martin. From Geneva, I'm Harry Blight. Until next time, goodbye.
*27:03.460- 27:13.300* :  I made up my mind today. When the sun grows down, it's time to break. When the wind blows down,
*27:13.300- 27:21.900* :  fly away. I spend my wings and fly away. I made up my mind today. When the sun goes down,
*27:21.900- 27:28.940* :  it's time to break. When the wind blows down, fly away. I spend my wings and fly away.
