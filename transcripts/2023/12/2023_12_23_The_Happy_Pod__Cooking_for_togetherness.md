*00:48.040- 00:52.480* :  your BBC podcasts. Unmissable stories from around the globe from the BBC World Service.
*00:52.480- 00:59.900* :  My happy place is who I am. Search for the documentary, lives less ordinary, and amazing
*00:59.900- 01:09.960* :  sport stories, wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Hi, I'm Melanie. I'm in Sweden and you're listening
*01:09.960- 01:15.380* :  to BBC's HappyPod. She's right. This is the HappyPod from the BBC World Service.
*01:20.920- 01:25.240* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 23rd of December,
*01:25.780- 01:31.640* :  Soup and a cross-generational solution to loneliness. I didn't have my best day today, but now I'm here
*01:31.640- 01:38.420* :  and my whole mood is switched, so that's also really nice. How a university degree is offering
*01:38.420- 01:45.140* :  prison inmates a fresh start on their release? The learning experience, the personal instruction
*01:46.660- 01:51.560* :  is like nothing else. Also, the response was amazing. I want to say across all platforms,
*01:51.560- 01:56.360* :  tens of millions of views, and so many people being like, I've been scammed like that, this happened
*01:56.360- 02:04.420* :  to me. The online scam victim turned scam buster. Also in this podcast, how polar bear paw prints can
*02:04.420- 02:10.680* :  provide DNA clues to aid conservation. It is a bit of a Eureka moment. For us, I think the next
*02:10.680- 02:18.580* :  step is to make sure that that Eureka moment gets used by others. And a very special Christmas tree
*02:24.880- 02:29.760* :  ornament. Food brings people together, and in the Netherlands where they take tackling loneliness
*02:29.760- 02:36.640* :  seriously. The food stuff doing a lot of the bringing together is soup. Omba's soup is just one
*02:36.640- 02:43.280* :  part of the National Initiative, Intech in Enzermite, or one against loneliness. It brings together
*02:43.280- 02:48.800* :  older and younger people to socialize, to cook, and to eat. Claire Bates went along.
*02:50.780- 02:56.580* :  I met a community centre in Amsterdam, and in front of me there is a big long table with lots
*02:56.580- 03:00.620* :  of people sitting around it, older and younger people together. They've got chopping boards put
*03:00.620- 03:06.240* :  in front of them, and some big silver bowls, and they've all come together today to make soup.
*03:09.700- 03:14.880* :  Can you speak English to us? Yes, you do great. And can you explain to me what's happening here,
*03:14.880- 03:19.840* :  what we're doing today? It's a cooking day, and we're making a tomato lentil spinach soup.
*03:20.300- 03:25.780* :  We're going to cut other ingredients, and then marita is going to make the soup, and yeah,
*03:25.780- 03:31.020* :  we're going to have fun. And can you tell me the name? Sonnet. And have you fun today with
*03:31.020- 03:36.600* :  Emma's soup before? Yeah, this is, I think, my third time. Why is it that you like to do this?
*03:37.060- 03:42.760* :  Yeah, well, it's really nice to connect with everyone, because you can learn so much from
*03:42.760- 03:47.160* :  all people, and it's really nice that they have so much fun being here, and that you can talk
*03:47.160- 03:52.600* :  to them about a lot of things, and they have so much to tell, because together they're lonely,
*03:52.940- 03:58.080* :  so I think everyone will feel lonely sometimes, it's just a lot of luck. Yeah, it is, it is.
*03:58.660- 04:03.760* :  I didn't have my best day today, but now I'm here, and my whole mood is switched, so that's also
*04:03.760- 04:08.240* :  really nice. Can you introduce me to some people that you've made connections with?
*04:08.240- 04:14.020* :  Yeah, of course. Yeah, this is Lenny. Lenny? Yeah, he's one of my best friends.
*04:17.940- 04:22.840* :  He's 88, right now. Yeah. And can you ask her what she thinks of these sessions?
*04:22.840- 04:29.480* :  What's she think of them? Of Charlotte, Charlotte. Yeah, they're up to Charlotte, but she's
*04:29.540- 04:35.900* :  very fun, and very, yeah, she's elegant, so Dutch word for a cozy and warm and warm,
*04:35.900- 04:42.680* :  and black, like, then. Yeah, she's happy that she's here. Can I sit down and help with maybe
*04:42.680- 04:47.240* :  cutting some vegetables? Yeah, I can get you a plate. Yes, please. Yeah, I'll be great.
*04:49.140- 04:53.480* :  The cooking sessions take place around once a week, and 12 cities across the Netherlands.
*04:54.320- 04:58.480* :  Each city has a student board that organises the sessions and finds volunteers.
*04:59.560- 05:04.800* :  Louise is on the student board for Amsterdam. Well, it's definitely helped me step out of my
*05:04.800- 05:13.100* :  comfort zone, and right now I'm 21, and I tend to associate with people from my age.
*05:13.280- 05:18.180* :  Was it hard to find common ground? I thought some people might be dull, or might not be very
*05:18.180- 05:23.680* :  interested, but the opposite is true, to be honest. They all have different stories. You get to
*05:23.680- 05:29.180* :  hear about world stories, you get to hear about the bingo they had last week. They're always very
*05:29.180- 05:34.220* :  enthusiastic. They're also quite cheeky, so I didn't expect that at first. So it's actually
*05:34.220- 05:40.080* :  changed your whole view of a different generation. It has, yes, definitely. They also give very good
*05:40.080- 05:43.140* :  advice. I've had some very good love advice from them, so that was great.
*05:49.380- 05:54.220* :  Thank you. It's really good too. Is it? Okay. So I'm going to just try this, see.
*05:58.440- 05:59.220* :  Yeah, and that's really good.
*06:01.820- 06:06.160* :  Claire Bates in Amsterdam, and you can hear more about how the Netherlands is dealing with
*06:06.160- 06:11.360* :  loneliness from our friends at people fixing the world on BBC World Service and online.
*06:12.180- 06:18.540* :  Now, to an extraordinary escape from a terrifying force of nature, when deadly tornadoes swept
*06:18.540- 06:24.300* :  through the U.S. State of Tennessee, a young couple were horrified to see their baby carried
*06:24.300- 06:30.600* :  off still in his cradle. Chloe Kim reported on the story for the BBC. A four-month-old baby
*06:31.020- 06:38.200* :  after being ripped from its mobile home in a tornado was found safe in a tree, considering all
*06:38.200- 06:44.640* :  the things it had gone through was largely unharmed and un-injured. And the parents had said that
*06:44.980- 06:51.340* :  when they're in their mobile home, which is outside of Nashville, Tennessee, they had not any
*06:51.340- 06:57.520* :  warning really when the tornado was going to come through. And the mother, Sydney Moore, said she
*06:57.520- 07:03.480* :  had lunch after her one-year-old baby to protect him. She had seen her boyfriend try to grab their
*07:03.480- 07:09.440* :  four-month-old from his bassinet, and as soon as that had happened, the roof had been ripped off
*07:09.440- 07:16.360* :  already. And as he's trying to grab the four-month-old, the tornado just comes in and picks him up
*07:16.720- 07:23.340* :  with the bassinet. And then shortly after the tornado had ended, they had been searching for their
*07:23.340- 07:31.040* :  four-month-old in the pouring rain and miraculously about 10 minutes later or so, 30 feet from their
*07:31.040- 07:37.560* :  house or where their home used to be. They had found their baby in this tree, and again, largely
*07:37.560- 07:43.180* :  unharmed, considering all the things that it had gone through. Absolutely terrifying. And for
*07:43.180- 07:50.940* :  people who are not familiar with the sort of power of a tornado, just describe for us a little bit
*07:50.940- 07:57.440* :  some of the devastation because it is extraordinary, isn't it? This one had peaked it 125 miles per hour.
*07:58.060- 08:05.340* :  Other toys from their home, other baby toys, and playpans had been kind of wrapped around a tree
*08:05.340- 08:12.240* :  from the force of the wind. And so the mother Sydney had said, luckily, that he wasn't in one of
*08:12.240- 08:17.640* :  those playpans that was wrapped around a tree, but was in this bassinet that is obviously now,
*08:17.640- 08:23.760* :  you know, thrown in amongst the rubble and miraculous that he was unharmed.
*08:24.300- 08:32.520* :  How are Sydney and her family now? They are, I think, of course shaken, but all things considered
*08:32.540- 08:39.660* :  happy that the four of them are okay. That was Chloe Kim. Now, you might remember that a few
*08:39.660- 08:44.880* :  months ago, back in July, we heard about a program in the US to help prisoners get a college
*08:44.880- 08:50.460* :  education, the better to build a new life once they get out. Well, now the inaugural class has
*08:50.460- 08:55.840* :  graduated. They have earned bachelor's degrees from Northwestern University in the state of Illinois,
*08:55.840- 09:01.040* :  thanks to the university's prison education program. Peter Goffin has been speaking to some of
*09:01.040- 09:06.380* :  the students and sent this report. I welcome you to the fellowship of scholars.
*09:11.220- 09:17.500* :  One by one, 16 men were called to the stage inside a former cellhouse at Stateville Correctional
*09:17.500- 09:23.440* :  Center. They traded in their prison uniforms for scholars gowns and mortar boards,
*09:23.500- 09:29.260* :  ready to start the next chapter of their lives as graduates of Northwestern University.
*09:29.260- 09:34.900* :  To talk about something being amazing while living in maximum security sounds like a silly
*09:34.900- 09:42.220* :  statement, but the learning experience, the personal instruction, it's like nothing else.
*09:42.820- 09:48.240* :  This is Lynn Greene, one of the students speaking from Stateville a few days before the ceremony.
*09:48.960- 09:55.140* :  He now plans to pursue a master's degree in psychology. When our instructors come in and they teach us,
*09:55.780- 10:01.580* :  we realize that we're not so rigid, that we're actually malignant, that we can still be formed and shaped
*10:02.300- 10:08.600* :  all over again. Northwestern started its prison education program in 2018 and it's helped
*10:08.600- 10:14.160* :  dozens of incarcerated people get associate degrees from a nearby community college.
*10:15.000- 10:20.800* :  But this is the first time that students have received a full bachelor's degree from Northwestern,
*10:20.800- 10:25.300* :  one of the most prestigious universities in America. You have read novels,
*10:25.340- 10:30.700* :  solved math equations, and completed chemistry labs. You have taken courses in psychology,
*10:30.700- 10:36.800* :  philosophy, and political science. Sociology professor Mary Patillo gave the ceremony's closing
*10:36.800- 10:46.060* :  address. Almost every crime reflects a cycle and often a circle of hurt and harm. Your stories
*10:46.060- 10:52.780* :  highlight the complexity of what lands people in places like Stateville. The US has the highest
*10:52.820- 10:57.860* :  prisoner population in the world, with nearly two million people living behind bars.
*10:58.700- 11:05.000* :  And it has a serious problem with recidivism. Government figures suggest that two-thirds of
*11:05.000- 11:10.920* :  Americans released from state prisons will be arrested again, and more than half will return to
*11:10.920- 11:18.180* :  prison within just a few years. But studies have shown those rates of re-arrest and re-incarceration
*11:18.180- 11:23.860* :  are drastically lower for people who've pursued higher education while incarcerated.
*11:24.500- 11:31.180* :  It's when you don't allow a person to have that higher education opportunity and send them back
*11:31.180- 11:37.420* :  out there in the quip in terms around it backfires and create a higher risk of recidivism.
*11:37.420- 11:43.640* :  Bernard McKinley is one of the new graduates. He's also the first person in the state of Illinois
*11:43.640- 11:49.040* :  ever to take the entrance exam for law school while in prison, and he hopes to one day become
*11:49.040- 11:57.120* :  a civil rights attorney. Education creates a way of evoking critical thought. You can't help but
*11:57.120- 12:02.080* :  do self-analysis until yourself, and see what you will and what you desire to be.
*12:02.140- 12:08.340* :  Bernard says education has made him a better person. Now, like many of the graduates,
*12:08.340- 12:13.560* :  he'll stay in the program as a teaching assistant, helping another group of north-western students
*12:13.560- 12:18.500* :  to transform their lives from behind bars. That was Peter Goffin.
*12:23.660- 12:28.840* :  Still to come in this podcast. And one of the photos that almost looks like it's smiling because
*12:28.840- 12:33.520* :  it looks so cozy and cute. But does it really belong in a Christmas tree?
*12:43.660- 12:49.340* :  Hello, I'm Katya Adler. Today on the global story, I'll be taking a look into the multi-million dollar
*12:49.340- 12:55.600* :  international Christmas music industry and asking what is the recipe for a successful Christmas song?
*12:55.600- 13:02.380* :  And why do the old tunes do the best? The global story brings you fresh takes and new perspectives
*13:02.380- 13:07.340* :  from BBC Journalists all around the world. Find us wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*13:14.820- 13:19.440* :  If we want to protect wildlife, we need to know which creatures are where, in what numbers,
*13:19.760- 13:24.720* :  and how they're doing. There are various ways of doing that involving varying levels of interaction
*13:24.720- 13:29.900* :  and intrusion. But our researchers have come up with something really clever. They found a way to
*13:29.900- 13:36.560* :  extract environmental DNA from poor prints left in the snow by threatened species such as polar bears
*13:36.560- 13:42.800* :  and lynxes. Dr Melanie Lancaster is the lead researcher at the World Wide Fund for Nature
*13:43.220- 13:50.800* :  and is currently in Solner, Sweden. I'm very interested in making sure species like polar bears and
*13:50.800- 13:58.060* :  lynxes and snow leopards actually continue to thrive and exist on our planet. So that's really
*13:58.060- 14:05.220* :  why I do what I do. And of course, I think many, many people around the world are captivated by
*14:05.220- 14:10.580* :  animals like polar bears and snow leopards and lynxes. There's something that we seem to be able to
*14:10.580- 14:16.540* :  relate to when it comes to other large mammals. And the couple of times I've actually been out into
*14:16.540- 14:22.600* :  the Arctic in quite remote settings. It's hard to believe that animals like polar bears can survive
*14:22.600- 14:27.760* :  such conditions, but they're just so beautifully adapted to do so. It's quite a wondrous thing.
*14:29.180- 14:38.120* :  And now you can, we are told, extract environmental DNA from poor prints. What do you mean by
*14:38.120- 14:45.580* :  environmental DNA as opposed to just regular old DNA? So we all have DNA and all living creatures
*14:46.320- 14:52.080* :  leave or shed parts of themselves into the environment. And when we talk about environmental DNA,
*14:52.080- 14:59.700* :  that's what we mean. So we can shed our skin cells and leave them in the environment. And we can
*14:59.700- 15:06.400* :  shed our hairs. And those parts of our cells that we live in the environment actually can contain
*15:06.400- 15:12.560* :  our cells or cellular material. And it's from that cellular material that we can actually access DNA.
*15:14.080- 15:20.100* :  So what is it that you're actually looking for? And why was it you needed to find a new way to do it?
*15:21.080- 15:25.760* :  I think one of the things that a lot of people don't realise is that we still don't know a lot about
*15:26.020- 15:31.760* :  polar bears. So we know that they exist across the Arctic and we know that they're divided into
*15:31.760- 15:37.580* :  about 19 subpopulations. But for about half of those subpopulations, we don't know much about
*15:37.600- 15:41.520* :  them at all. We don't even know how many polar bears there are. So that's why we, when we talk about
*15:41.520- 15:47.200* :  the number of polar bears that there are, we have such a large estimate. And so we're always looking
*15:47.200- 15:56.400* :  for new tools to help us to provide that sort of information. And why is it that being able to
*15:56.400- 16:04.000* :  extract environmental DNA from paw prints that have been left in the snow is a better way to do it
*16:04.000- 16:09.080* :  than the ways that have been previously used to find out about these creatures? I think it's
*16:09.080- 16:13.940* :  definitely better in some ways because it means that you don't even need to see the animal
*16:14.420- 16:21.840* :  to actually collect part of it. And that part of it is the environmental DNA that's left
*16:21.840- 16:28.620* :  from the skin cells that are shed from the foot pads of the polar bear as it walks. And so in that
*16:28.620- 16:33.760* :  way, the method is very good because it doesn't require contact with the animal. It also doesn't
*16:33.760- 16:41.460* :  require the animal to be captured or sedated in order to obtain that information. It's a much less
*16:41.460- 16:47.660* :  intrusive method of being able to collect that DNA. When you've made a discovery like this,
*16:47.660- 16:54.460* :  that you are able to do something new and very clever and non-invasive to the animals,
*16:54.860- 17:00.020* :  do you get a eureka moment? How does that feel when you realise that you've got something new and
*17:00.020- 17:10.320* :  exciting? Yeah, I mean, it's very, very exciting to have this new tool that we can use. So it is
*17:10.320- 17:15.120* :  a bit of a eureka moment. For us, I think the next step is to make sure that that eureka moment
*17:15.940- 17:20.780* :  gets used by others. It's a pretty groundbreaking method, actually. So that's what we really hope
*17:20.940- 17:27.880* :  will happen next. And so what we really would like to do is make sure that this tool that we've
*17:27.880- 17:34.220* :  developed actually gets out into the research community. Dr Melanie Lancaster of the World Wide
*17:34.220- 17:40.100* :  Fund for Nature. Now it might come as a shock to you to discover that the internet is not all cat
*17:40.100- 17:45.460* :  videos. Unfortunately, there are also a lot of scammers out there who will lure you in with
*17:45.460- 17:51.960* :  convincing websites steal from you then vanish. But now it's time for the scammers to beware.
*17:52.400- 17:58.500* :  Meet Ryan Kelly who's using his tech savvy to turn the tables much to the delight of his
*17:58.500- 18:03.760* :  millions of social media followers. This is a fake company set up as a front to scam people
*18:03.760- 18:07.820* :  and it got a follower of mine. A guy that was just leaving the military who wanted to ship his car
*18:07.820- 18:11.660* :  back home so he could get back to civilian life and then they stole his money. And this is my
*18:11.660- 18:16.620* :  master's degree in Homeland Security. Let's make the bad guys pay. So I emailed the company that
*18:16.620- 18:20.600* :  scammed and pretending that I wanted to ship my car and I sent him a link. Hmm, that's weird
*18:20.600- 18:24.040* :  that a guy claimed me to be in the US and working for a California based company called me from
*18:24.040- 18:28.520* :  India. Maybe he's on vacation and just dedicated to the job. So he gives me a quote saying he can
*18:28.520- 18:33.520* :  take my car from Virginia to Missouri. The pickup location is the FBI Academy. So I call him to
*18:33.520- 18:37.100* :  confirm everything and also convince him to give me his company's MC and Department of Transportation
*18:37.100- 18:42.180* :  Number which are publicly available to check. Oh buddy this you it seems like you're not authorized
*18:42.180- 18:46.840* :  to do interstate travel and wait a minute you have just offered to do interstate travel crazy
*18:46.840- 18:50.940* :  but it gets better. Bro is this you with the name and the address you didn't use that alias
*18:50.940- 18:55.440* :  on multiple things did you? That's not the house you bought under the same alias to front this
*18:55.440- 19:01.020* :  business is it spoiler alert it is be real shame if all that data got reported and unlike that fake
*19:01.020- 19:05.620* :  company we'll just keep trucking along here. So Ryan what was it that prompted this campaign?
*19:06.300- 19:11.980* :  I was getting ready to move from Los Angeles back to St. Louis. I was supposed to be setting up
*19:11.980- 19:19.080* :  so that my car could get transported. So went through a company that is supposed to be a broker
*19:19.080- 19:25.180* :  to set you up with other people and unfortunately they set me up with a scam company and so they stole
*19:25.180- 19:33.480* :  $712.50 and so I was sitting there and I was like well I have the time and I have the degrees
*19:34.380- 19:39.160* :  so I kind of understand how this works. So I'm just going to start putting together who these people
*19:39.160- 19:44.660* :  are and by the end of the first day I had their driver's license, home address and I realized that
*19:44.660- 19:49.240* :  okay I need to turn this into the local FBI office for them and how that story ended was essentially
*19:49.240- 19:53.660* :  you know the FBI so that they would take action and I actually messaged the CEO of the company
*19:53.660- 20:00.400* :  that I had been set up with a scammer. He was really cool and actually refunded me my money.
*20:01.260- 20:06.580* :  When and why did you start sharing these scamming scammer stories on TikTok?
*20:07.920- 20:12.080* :  Well it was after I got scammed for the first time and I kind of got to tell the story as it was
*20:12.080- 20:18.440* :  happening and I wanted people to know that this is what had happened and the response was amazing.
*20:19.060- 20:23.720* :  I mean it was I want to say across all platforms tens of millions of views and so many people
*20:23.720- 20:29.200* :  being like I've been scammed like that this happened to me and at that moment I realized oh I can do
*20:29.220- 20:38.120* :  this more often and so I set up a scam submission form on my website and since then I've I've
*20:38.120- 20:45.360* :  gotten gosh four or five thousand submissions and tell me about what's been your favorite scam so far
*20:45.360- 20:50.760* :  that you've managed to bust. Oh I managed to shut down a call center that was pretending to be
*20:50.760- 20:56.360* :  PayPal which I think was very funny rewarding because it was just such a mass scam and I actually
*20:56.360- 21:02.140* :  put that together by getting so many submissions from people that matched and I was like wait this
*21:02.140- 21:07.800* :  is way bigger than what I initially thought. What kind of reactions have you had to successfully
*21:07.800- 21:13.840* :  quote unquote scamming a scammer? It's been varied but very fun. I think that one of my favorite
*21:13.840- 21:19.340* :  moments had to be I had a military veteran in the US who said hey I got scammed I tried to
*21:19.340- 21:23.920* :  ship my car home I just left the military and I lost my money and that obviously hit me very
*21:23.920- 21:28.160* :  personally because that's how I got scammed and so I went after this guy scammer ended up finding
*21:29.380- 21:35.320* :  the house they had it set up the business in that was actually a fake business and where they
*21:35.320- 21:39.960* :  actually were which was actually abroad and I got an email from the Department of Transportation
*21:39.980- 21:45.320* :  investigative division I got to say it was not expecting the federal government to reach out but
*21:45.320- 21:50.060* :  they apparently saw the video and that was really cool they were they were very sweet and very
*21:50.900- 21:56.120* :  happy to have the information which I was able to pass along and online we've seen a lot of support
*21:56.120- 22:01.160* :  a lot of people that are very happy that I'm going after these people but I've also seen
*22:01.160- 22:06.880* :  this you know a lot of these scams come from West Africa specifically Nigeria and I have had so
*22:06.880- 22:14.060* :  many Nigerians email me DM me and say thank you for getting these guys they're giving us a bad name
*22:14.860- 22:19.600* :  it's just really cool that like a group of people that have been stigmatized by this smaller group
*22:19.600- 22:25.000* :  of people in their country it comes to me because get them and I love that I think it's very fun
*22:26.140- 22:34.940* :  and moving forward Ryan what's your advice for staying safe online take your time if anything feels
*22:34.940- 22:41.300* :  rushed don't do it most businesses will not try to rush you that's not how that works I would also
*22:41.300- 22:46.620* :  say that look for inconsistencies if you see somebody coming through and they're like hey we work
*22:46.620- 22:51.780* :  for this company and it's from a Gmail account or I think using the company's website you know give
*22:51.780- 22:57.540* :  it a Google and always check if something comes through that you didn't pay for check to make sure
*22:57.540- 23:03.880* :  the emails number matches up with the actual company number and sometimes I've had that happen
*23:03.880- 23:09.960* :  where I've had people send over a scam and they're like hey this group tried to scam me and I
*23:09.960- 23:15.580* :  call it it's the legitimate power company of their local area and I'm like sorry guys I was just

*23:29.340- 23:34.980* :  space and they hope it'll eventually improve communications with remote parts of the solar system
*23:35.780- 23:42.020* :  and yes this one really was a cat video Rory Gallimore reports Taters the ginger tabby is not
*23:42.020- 23:47.700* :  hurtling through the blackness of space towards an asteroid the cat's paws remain firmly on our
*23:47.700- 23:52.600* :  planet but a spacecraft making that journey has successfully transmitted footage of the pet
*23:52.920- 23:57.260* :  playing on a sofa across a vast distance complete with that beat soundtrack
*24:00.060- 24:05.220* :  using lasers the brief clip traveled more than 30 million kilometers in less than two minutes
*24:05.220- 24:10.500* :  NASA says it's pleased with the results of the test one of the lead scientists said the video
*24:10.500- 24:16.380* :  streamed faster the most broadband internet connections before adding everyone loves Taters
*24:16.920- 24:22.560* :  yes they do Rory Gallimore there now if you celebrate Christmas the chances are you already
*24:22.560- 24:28.520* :  have a tree in your house covered in decorations and with gifts piled underneath but some people's
*24:28.520- 24:34.600* :  tree decorations are more animated than others indeed Michelle White from Kentucky and the US
*24:34.600- 24:40.200* :  discovered that she had a small owl nestled in hers her daughter Madeline shared a video on the
*24:40.200- 24:47.360* :  social media site tiktok and the little owl went viral of course it was like a tiny little grayish
*24:47.700- 24:54.160* :  brown undertones owl in one of the photos it almost looks like it's smiling because it looks so
*24:54.160- 25:02.440* :  cozy and cute okay so you didn't realize that you had this little visitor where did you get your
*25:02.440- 25:08.300* :  tree from and how long did it take you to realize you had a guest so my family and I we always go
*25:08.300- 25:16.260* :  to the same local Christmas tree shop in Lexington Kentucky and so we got the tree delivered on
*25:16.260- 25:24.280* :  Black Friday and we did not realize there was an owl until that following Monday so all of that
*25:24.280- 25:31.200* :  time there was this little owl I do know that the tree was in quite a busy room in your home
*25:31.360- 25:40.220* :  how did you not notice I that is the million dollar question because the fact that it didn't make
*25:40.220- 25:49.540* :  a a peep the whole time I'm just my assumption is that he was buried deep into the tree like near
*25:49.540- 25:57.540* :  that where the trunk is and he was the same color as the trunk which is why I assume he blended in
*25:57.540- 26:04.960* :  so well but I I guess he was sleeping during the day and active at night whenever
*26:04.960- 26:09.360* :  anyone else was asleep so do you feel bad for the owl because it was just sitting there
*26:09.360- 26:15.420* :  minding its own business and suddenly discovers it's been owl-napped well there's multiple owls
*26:15.420- 26:21.640* :  that we've seen in our neighborhood so when we released it because where my parents house is
*26:22.080- 26:28.560* :  it's in a big foresty area with lots of trees so there's lots of wildlife living out there
*26:29.420- 26:37.500* :  he didn't seem to be injured or dehydrated at all and I mean the second he went outside he flew
*26:37.500- 26:44.600* :  right away towards all the trees but I mean I assume he was drinking the water of the tree like
*26:44.600- 26:51.260* :  where you keep water in the bottom part of the Christmas trees and then I don't know if we have
*26:51.260- 26:58.860* :  dog food I'm not sure if he was able to maybe sneak some some of that at night but we did find
*26:58.860- 27:05.800* :  some owl droppings behind the tree after we realized so and your mom is making sure you will
*27:05.800- 27:11.800* :  still have an owl in your tree right oh yes she has needle pointed an owl ornament and then
*27:11.800- 27:17.440* :  all of her friends have brought over little owl gifts so that we'll remember this Christmas forever
