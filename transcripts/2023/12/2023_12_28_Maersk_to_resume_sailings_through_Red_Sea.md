*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.540* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.800- 00:24.680* :  I'm Rachel Wright and in the early hours of Thursday, the 28th of December, these are our main
*00:24.680- 00:29.700* :  stories. The Merck shipping line says it's restarting journeys through the Red Sea,
*00:29.700- 00:32.900* :  despite the threat of attacks by Iranian-backed rebels.
*00:33.200- 00:38.520* :  It opens up the corridor between Europe and Asia, so it's really important to global prosperity.
*00:39.160- 00:45.580* :  The New York Times sews the artificial intelligence tool, chat, GPT, for using its archive,
*00:46.100- 00:50.800* :  and the architect of the modern European Union, Jacques de Lors, dies at 98.
*00:54.060- 00:59.800* :  Also in this podcast, France's president weighs into the row of the country's most famous actor,
*01:00.320- 01:06.980* :  and the moment when I was leaving Pyongyang, I was Korean, just outside I am mixed race,
*01:06.980- 01:13.320* :  but inside I am Asian. The girl from Equatorial Guinea who ended up in the guardianship
*01:13.460- 01:15.820* :  of the North Korean leader Kim Il Sun.
*01:20.660- 01:24.200* :  Just over two weeks ago, Merck, the Danish shipping giant,
*01:24.620- 01:27.400* :  announced it was pausing all journeys through the Red Sea,
*01:27.400- 01:32.660* :  after Houthi rebels based in Yemen stepped up their attacks on vessels in the area.
*01:32.660- 01:37.020* :  The Houthis, which are backed by Iran and support Hamas,
*01:37.020- 01:40.920* :  said they were targeting ships which they believed were heading for Israel.
*01:41.540- 01:45.920* :  The Red Sea is a key shipping route because it gives access to the Suez Canal.
*01:46.620- 01:51.380* :  To avoid the threat, Merck and other companies have been redirecting some ships all the way around
*01:51.380- 01:57.900* :  Africa, adding many days to their journey. But now Merck has said it will resume Red Sea operations
*01:57.900- 02:04.220* :  after a US-led coalition sent warships to patrol the area. I spoke to our business reporter,
*02:04.220- 02:11.240* :  Jonathan Josephs. Merck have decided that they can now sail through the Red Sea and the Suez
*02:11.260- 02:16.980* :  Canal because of the safety guarantees that have been provided by this international coalition of
*02:16.980- 02:23.340* :  warships led by the United States, called Operation Prosperity Guardian. They think that with that
*02:23.340- 02:27.960* :  they can sail safely through, but they have said that they will reassess things on a case-by-case
*02:27.960- 02:33.180* :  basis that there may still be some diversions around the Cape of Good Hope, around the bottom of Africa
*02:33.180- 02:37.180* :  there, but that the safety of their crew members is their number one priority.
*02:37.560- 02:42.580* :  And that's in contrast to what we've heard from Hapagloid, the German shipping line,
*02:42.580- 02:47.420* :  which is the fifth biggest in the world, and they think it's still not safe and that they are not
*02:47.420- 02:53.880* :  going to continue sailing through the Suez Canal and that they will have to update the situation
*02:53.880- 02:59.600* :  as time goes on. That's quite a big difference in approach, isn't it? It is Rachel. I think what it
*02:59.600- 03:03.980* :  goes to show is that there is a limited amount, though, that can be done to protect these ships.
*03:03.980- 03:11.300* :  We saw on Tuesday another ship. The MSC United 8 was attacked by the Houthi rebels. They
*03:11.300- 03:15.840* :  took to social media to claim responsibility, saying they struck it with a naval missile and
*03:15.840- 03:21.000* :  that it was done out of solidarity with Palestinian suffering and Gaza. But that strike, despite
*03:21.000- 03:27.820* :  the presence of these western warships in the region, goes to show that security is still very fragile.
*03:28.420- 03:34.620* :  MSC that owns this ship say that none of their crew were injured and that it was engaging with
*03:34.620- 03:41.640* :  that military coalition to try and keep it safe, but even so, it wasn't able to prevent this attack
*03:41.640- 03:45.560* :  from happening. This is one of the most important shipping routes in the world,
*03:45.560- 03:51.920* :  according to the Egyptians who control it. It accounts from about 12% of global trade by volume.
*03:52.160- 03:57.460* :  It opens up the corridor between Europe and Asia, so it's really important to global prosperity.
*03:57.460- 04:04.000* :  But with these delays, we're seeing anything from seven days for a ship that are going to or from
*04:04.000- 04:08.960* :  the United States east coast to a two week delay for anyone that's got to go around the
*04:08.960- 04:14.440* :  Cape of Good Hope and get up to the eastern Mediterranean. And that could have a broader impact
*04:14.440- 04:20.300* :  on global trade. Well, exactly. I mean, I've seen reports that Ikea has said that they might
*04:20.300- 04:26.440* :  be facing a problem with stock in the coming weeks. Is this going to have a big effect on business
*04:26.440- 04:32.360* :  worldwide? The longer it goes on, the bigger the impact, because ships were devoted at pretty
*04:32.360- 04:37.860* :  short notice. And so that will cause disruption to supply chains. Companies like the French
*04:37.860- 04:43.860* :  St√©ry, Manufacturer Dunon have also said they're assessing the impact. So there certainly will be
*04:43.860- 04:49.620* :  delays and there could potentially be gaps on shelves in shops across Europe and potentially in
*04:49.620- 04:55.000* :  America as well. Prices could go up and at a time when inflation is still very much a concern,
*04:55.000- 04:59.600* :  for economies around the world. That's perhaps the last thing that many people want to see.
*05:00.200- 05:05.100* :  Jonathan Joseph's. Well, since the war between Hummus and Israel began in October,
*05:05.100- 05:10.640* :  there have been growing fears it could widen into a regional conflict engulfing the Middle East.
*05:10.640- 05:16.440* :  On Tuesday, Israel's defence minister said his country was under attack from Gaza and the
*05:16.440- 05:22.900* :  occupied West Bank to Iraq and Iran. Now, a cabinet colleague, Benny Gantz, has warned that Israel
*05:22.900- 05:27.620* :  will no longer tolerate further attacks from Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.
*05:29.180- 05:33.880* :  The situation on Israel's northern border demands change. The stopwatch for diplomatic
*05:33.880- 05:39.220* :  solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent
*05:39.220- 05:44.760* :  the firing on Israel's northern residents and to remove Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will
*05:44.760- 05:51.080* :  do it. Benny Gantz, meanwhile, has been no respite for the people of Gaza as Israel steps up its
*05:51.080- 05:57.220* :  offensive across the enclave, shifting its focus to southern and central areas. There are reports
*05:57.220- 06:02.160* :  that the U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, will travel to the Middle East next week for
*06:02.160- 06:07.340* :  another round of talks about the war. The U.S. has blocked the UN Security Council from calling
*06:07.340- 06:13.500* :  for a ceasefire, much to the consternation of many countries. It has, however, urged Israel to
*06:13.500- 06:19.380* :  rein in its offensive in Gaza because of the huge number of civilian deaths there, more than 21,000
*06:19.380- 06:24.600* :  according to the Hamas run health ministry. For his assessment on how President Biden is handling
*06:24.600- 06:30.280* :  the crisis, his Gary O'Donohue. On the world stage, Washington is finding itself increasingly
*06:30.280- 06:36.740* :  isolated in its support for Israel. But recently, there's been a change in tone. It's now urging
*06:36.740- 06:42.600* :  its ally to transition to a new phase of the war, targeting high-value Hamas individuals,
*06:43.180- 06:48.140* :  while scaling back what Joe Biden has described as indiscriminate bombing.
*06:48.960- 06:54.000* :  Officials here believe their strategy of backing Israel while urging restraint
*06:54.000- 07:00.540* :  has brought some limited results. There was the seven-day ceasefire, and more than 100 hostages
*07:00.540- 07:07.060* :  released. And aid started to flow again, though nowhere near, at the levels needed, to avert a
*07:07.060- 07:13.960* :  humanitarian crisis. But Washington is starting to lose patience, and, importantly, the administration
*07:13.960- 07:20.060* :  has already lost significant support at home. A sizeable majority of the American public
*07:20.060- 07:26.580* :  disapproves of Joe Biden's handling of the conflict, with only around a third backing his approach.
*07:26.860- 07:34.240* :  Even more worryingly for him, US policy on the war has the support of just one in five young voters,
*07:34.240- 07:40.820* :  a key constituent for the president, as he enters an election year. In brutal political terms,
*07:40.820- 07:46.400* :  the war has also prevented the president from focusing on key domestic messages,
*07:46.400- 07:52.800* :  such as the economy, and contributed to leaving his general approval rating below 40%.
*07:53.880- 08:00.380* :  Gary Adonuhue. The New York Times is suing Microsoft and OpenAI, claiming they breached the
*08:00.380- 08:06.900* :  paper's copyright by using its articles to train chat GPT. The artificial intelligence tool
*08:06.900- 08:12.560* :  can write essays and scripts and generate ideas as if it were a human by allowing someone to
*08:12.560- 08:18.180* :  interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with another person. The New York
*08:18.180- 08:24.100* :  Times is seeking billions of dollars in damages, and once Microsoft and OpenAI to stop using its
*08:24.100- 08:29.500* :  materials for their models. The companies have yet to comment, but they previously said that
*08:29.500- 08:35.620* :  training AI on copyrighted material amounts to fair use. I heard more from our technology reporter,
*08:35.620- 08:42.560* :  Tom Gurkin. The New York Times is claiming that millions of articles published on its website were
*08:42.560- 08:49.460* :  used without its permission to make chat GPT sort of smarter, if you like, chat GPT works by
*08:49.820- 08:54.400* :  looking at all the different things found on the internet, and it regurgitates that information
*08:54.680- 08:59.360* :  for lack of a better word. The New York Times evidence for this is their saying, when they ask
*08:59.360- 09:05.540* :  chat GPT about certain current events, it would give them the baitum excerpts from New York Times
*09:05.540- 09:10.480* :  articles, not just the publicly available ones, but ones that are normally behind a paywall
*09:10.480- 09:15.220* :  that you could only access with a subscription. That's the big allegation they're making.
*09:15.460- 09:21.480* :  There are some news organisations such as PA, which have actually reached a deal with OpenAI
*09:21.480- 09:27.280* :  behind the scenes to exchange information, but how much that's worth, the renumeration rather,
*09:27.280- 09:31.660* :  that's not public information. Where the New York Times tried to come to such an agreement,
*09:31.660- 09:36.660* :  they weren't able to with OpenAI. So I think that's at the heart of a lot of this. It actually
*09:36.660- 09:41.440* :  goes further than just this one case in terms of the media, because there are multiple lawsuits
*09:41.440- 09:46.740* :  which OpenAI are facing from different people across the arts. It's not just the media.
*09:47.220- 09:51.700* :  Novelists, Georgia, are martyne of the Game of Thrones and John Grisham. They filed lawsuits
*09:51.700- 09:56.780* :  against OpenAI, so it's comedian Sarah Silverman. So there's quite a few different suits
*09:56.780- 10:02.560* :  from people who are saying what we made our art has been taken. I mean isn't this a fundamental
*10:02.560- 10:09.660* :  problem with artificial intelligence then? If it is harvesting archives of all organisations and
*10:09.660- 10:15.640* :  people are able to access it for free and there's no accreditation, nobody knows where it's coming from.
*10:16.060- 10:20.500* :  Yes, and the problem that comes off the back of that is if nobody knows what it's coming from,
*10:20.500- 10:24.440* :  but it is just being taken from parts of the internet, it has to be sourced somewhere,
*10:24.860- 10:29.500* :  then this is really at the heart of what the New York Times claim. If people go to chat GBT for their
*10:29.500- 10:34.560* :  news or search engines powered by these artificial intelligence tools, then they won't need to go
*10:34.560- 10:39.200* :  to the news websites. And of course if that happens, there'll be less news produced by journalists
*10:39.200- 10:44.160* :  such as me. So it is a problem which has to find a solution, because otherwise it'll be a
*10:44.160- 10:49.620* :  mutually assured destruction. Tom Gurkin, the former head of the European Commission,
*10:49.620- 10:56.080* :  Jacques Delors, has died at the age of 98. He took up the role as Europe's top civil servant
*10:56.080- 11:02.960* :  in 1985 and spent the next decade pursuing his goal of federalising the bloc, often in the face
*11:02.960- 11:08.720* :  of stiff opposition from British politicians. President Macron of France was among many who have
*11:08.720- 11:14.300* :  paid tribute to him, describing him as a statesman who'd served as an inexhaustible architect
*11:14.300- 11:20.480* :  of Europe. Chris Morris looks back at his life. Born into a working class family in 1925,
*11:20.480- 11:25.620* :  Jacques Delors was a French technocrat and politician who became the most powerful president
*11:25.620- 11:32.100* :  that the European Commission has ever seen. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s he was a dominant
*11:32.100- 11:38.400* :  political figure in Europe, an ardent federalist who believed passionately in the need to set up a
*11:38.400- 11:44.380* :  single European state to compete on a global level. Mr. Delors oversaw the creation of the European
*11:44.380- 11:49.880* :  single market, and he put the plans into place for the launch of the euro. He helped make the
*11:49.880- 11:55.880* :  European Union what it is today, but he also clashed repeatedly with British political leaders
*11:55.880- 12:01.800* :  in particular with Margaret Thatcher. The president of the Commission, Mr. Delors, said at press
*12:01.800- 12:07.360* :  conference the other day that he wanted the European Parliament to be the democratic body of the
*12:07.360- 12:12.280* :  community. He wanted the Commission to be the executive, and he wanted the council of ministers
*12:12.280- 12:19.640* :  to be the Senate. No! No! No! No! Such was the scale of Mr. Delors' ambition and influence
*12:19.640- 12:24.580* :  that he inspired one of the more memorable newspaper headlines in recent British history.
*12:24.580- 12:31.440* :  The Sun summed up its feelings in three words, up yours, Delors. Towards the end of his life Mr.
*12:31.440- 12:36.080* :  Delors admitted that the design of the single currency had been flawed from the start,
*12:36.140- 12:42.720* :  but that he argued was because there had been two little integration in the EU, not too much.
*12:43.420- 12:49.420* :  Chris Morris. Now to an extraordinary story of an African girl's upbringing in North Korea,
*12:49.860- 12:56.120* :  one of the world's most isolated and secretive states. In 1979, the first post-independence
*12:56.120- 13:01.460* :  president of Equatorial Guinea, Francisco Masea Sanguema sent his seven-year-old daughters
*13:01.460- 13:07.440* :  in North Korea to be educated under the guardianship of his ally, Kim Il Sun. Within months,
*13:07.440- 13:13.660* :  her father was executed in a military coup, and her mother became unreachable. She and her siblings
*13:13.660- 13:20.500* :  were forced to live in Pyongyang. That story is now the subject of a book, Black Girl, from Pyongyang,
*13:20.500- 13:25.640* :  in search of my identity by Monica Matthias. She spoke to James Coppnell.
*13:25.920- 13:32.180* :  I was one as the youngest daughter of the first president of Equatorial Guinea, Francisco Matthias.
*13:32.420- 13:38.920* :  Decolonization started, so spending left overnight, and the country did not have any pro-points
*13:38.920- 13:45.940* :  to push forward of Young Union to study, so Matthias decided to send Young Union to study abroad.
*13:45.940- 13:53.380* :  So, while African country was gaining independence, communist countries was reaching out to Africa.
*13:54.000- 13:58.500* :  You write at one point that you sort of integrated so much that you were a Black woman with a
*13:58.500- 14:05.520* :  Korean soul? Yes. Back then, when we arrived, I was six years old. I did not have an awareness of
*14:05.520- 14:11.820* :  what was going on around me. All that mattered to me was my mother. So, because I was rejecting
*14:11.820- 14:18.800* :  everything that is mine, which is a culture, language. Because of losing my mother over the night,
*14:18.800- 14:24.060* :  I couldn't see her. She disappeared from my life. I gave to myself a mission to say that I
*14:24.060- 14:30.140* :  must have become a Korean. So, I think it was in two months. I mastered Korean and wanted to
*14:30.140- 14:34.540* :  become a Korean. I remember I was stretching my hair, never become straight. I came in a song
*14:34.540- 14:40.440* :  and sent someone to teach me Spanish, and I rejected. So, it was more about rejecting the identity
*14:40.440- 14:46.220* :  because of my mom living. You mentioned Kim Il Sung, the Korean leader at the time. He was very much
*14:46.220- 14:53.380* :  your protector. Yes, because when our father sent us to North Korea, he sent us with two letters.
*14:54.000- 15:00.240* :  One was to Kim Il Sung, and the other one was to us. In that letter, he made it clear that he was
*15:00.240- 15:07.140* :  sending us under Kim Il Sung guidance to look after us, and he would decide which school he would send
*15:07.160- 15:12.900* :  us. Once we finished the study, we should go back to Guinea in order to build the country because
*15:13.000- 15:17.960* :  there was nothing after the colonization. So, the subtitle of your book is in search of my identity.
*15:17.960- 15:22.940* :  Was that then something revealed itself to you as you carried out your research for this?
*15:23.160- 15:29.140* :  The moment when I was living Pyongyang, I was Korean. Just outside I am mixed race,
*15:29.140- 15:36.160* :  but inside I am Asian. And as I was growing up, I wanted to know where I come from,
*15:36.240- 15:43.120* :  because all of us we want to be long. And also myself, I wanted to know where I come from,
*15:43.420- 15:50.380* :  and I started digging. And I think knowing yourself, your background, is very important because
*15:50.380- 15:56.900* :  it gives yourself awareness. And when you are self-aware, you become humble. And when you are humble,
*15:57.520- 16:03.680* :  whatever you do in your life, that reflects in what you do. And so, identity is really important
*16:03.740- 16:09.260* :  and a process that I have gone through. And finally, I find myself.
*16:10.080- 16:12.620* :  Monica Mathias speaking to James Coppnell.
*16:16.120- 16:19.560* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast, which are the best games?
*16:19.900- 16:25.120* :  Monopoly finishes about one-third into the game, and two-thirds of the time is spent with one person
*16:25.120- 16:31.420* :  bankrupting everybody else. Stay tuned to get tips from the author of Around the World in 80 Games.
*16:39.600- 16:45.480* :  A U.S. delegation, headed by the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, is meeting Mexico's President
*16:45.480- 16:51.620* :  Lopez Obdador for talks about the migrant crisis on the U.S. Southern border. In the last year,
*16:51.620- 16:55.900* :  around two million migrants have made the trip from Central and Southern America.
*16:56.560- 17:01.760* :  The border authorities have had to suspend several legal crossings to focus on processing
*17:01.760- 17:07.000* :  undocumented migrants. The U.S. wants Mexico to do more to stop the influx.
*17:07.360- 17:11.140* :  A Washington reporter, Shingai Nyoka, is following the talks.
*17:11.620- 17:18.120* :  It is a very difficult time for both countries. Both sides have been overwhelmed by this record
*17:18.120- 17:24.320* :  surge in irregular migrants are trying to cross the border from Mexico into the U.S.
*17:24.320- 17:31.580* :  Statistics say that about 10,000 people on average a day are crossing, and that's doubled
*17:31.580- 17:37.320* :  the number of people that were moving from Mexico to the U.S. pre-pandemic levels.
*17:37.320- 17:44.220* :  And we currently understand that even as this meeting is underway, about 7,000 people are moving
*17:44.220- 17:50.980* :  up from Mexico, from Central America, Cuba, and Venezuela, making their way through to the U.S.
*17:50.980- 17:56.800* :  and this, according to U.S. officials, is the single largest group of migrants, what they call a
*17:56.800- 18:01.920* :  caravan in the record. And so there are a lot of concerns by the U.S. government about what
*18:01.920- 18:07.680* :  needs to be done to ensure that the migrant crisis is resolved, and that's why this meeting is
*18:07.680- 18:11.660* :  taking place now. And what does the United States want Mexico to do?
*18:12.380- 18:18.700* :  They want Mexico to do more about slowing down that process. America has traditionally
*18:18.700- 18:25.860* :  leaned on Mexico to try to reduce the number of migrants crossing the border illegally.
*18:25.860- 18:31.000* :  Both sides have agreed that there's a need for additional enforcement at the border.
*18:31.480- 18:36.900* :  But the Mexican President says that the Mexico is doing everything that it can,
*18:36.900- 18:42.460* :  that is helping a lot on tackling migration. But what he wants to see is an agreement,
*18:42.540- 18:47.600* :  which is likely to include a greater commitment on aid.
*18:47.600- 18:53.900* :  Mexico also wants broader issues address such as the economic problems in Venezuela and in some
*18:53.900- 18:59.760* :  of the Central American countries so that migrants don't have that motive to move up to the U.S.
*18:59.780- 19:01.240* :  and search of opportunities.
*19:02.080- 19:08.300* :  Xingai, New Yorker. More than 50 French actors, writers, and cinema producers have signed an
*19:08.300- 19:13.540* :  open letter in support of Gerard Depardieu, who faces accusations of sexual assault.
*19:13.540- 19:18.540* :  They've been calls for him to be stripped of his legion d'on air. The letter denounces what
*19:18.540- 19:23.520* :  it calls the lynching of Depardieu, one of France's most famous and most divisive actors.
*19:23.880- 19:28.100* :  He denies any wrongdoing. Our reporter in the newsroom is Megan Owen.
*19:48.180- 19:54.380* :  A documentary released in December revealed sexual comments that he'd made to and about women.
*19:54.380- 19:59.160* :  Now he strongly denies all of the allegations and there's no court ruling against him.
*19:59.620- 20:04.100* :  Now the French President, Emmanuel Macron, came under fire for a TV interview he did in December,
*20:04.100- 20:08.180* :  where he defended the actor, saying that it was all a manhunt.
*20:08.560- 20:14.240* :  And most recently, over 50 French actors and other A-listers have written an open letter to
*20:14.240- 20:19.480* :  Le Fiecker Hall, which is a French newspaper, as saying, don't cancel Gerard Depardieu.
*20:19.940- 20:24.620* :  They say that it's a case of lynching. Among those who signed it are British actress Charlotte
*20:24.620- 20:30.100* :  Rampling, former French first lady and singer Carla Bruni, and Depardieu's former partner,
*20:30.100- 20:36.080* :  actress Carol Bouquet. Yeni Ezdiadis is also one of the other actors who signed the letter.
*20:36.420- 20:40.620* :  Depardieu is part of the history of French heritage. He has left an indelible mark.
*20:40.980- 20:46.400* :  So whatever you do, you won't be able to erase it. He's essential to the artistic history of our country.
*20:47.180- 20:52.440* :  The letter has sparked backlash from feminist critics and has divided opinion,
*20:52.440- 20:58.040* :  including on the streets of Paris. Why should he be protected just because he's an important figure?
*20:59.640- 21:02.900* :  It's not just one person making accusations. There are quite a few,
*21:03.280- 21:07.200* :  so I don't think it's a lynching. I think there are real questions to be asked about Depardieu,
*21:07.440- 21:12.120* :  who was a brilliant sublime actor in the 70s and 80s, and who's become a real wreck.
*21:13.000- 21:16.480* :  As learners, he hasn't been judged. We cannot attack him and take him down.
*21:16.940- 21:21.620* :  But on the other hand, we have to stop it taking too many years for him to be brought to trial.
*21:22.280- 21:27.480* :  Depardieu himself has called the signatories courageous and has praised the letter,
*21:27.940- 21:33.720* :  but mounting accusations against the actor suggest he won't be out of the spotlight anytime soon.
*21:34.560- 21:41.360* :  Meganoen. Now, the famous Hollywood sign in Los Angeles celebrated its 100th birthday this year,
*21:41.780- 21:45.880* :  and as you may have heard us reporting on the landmark that's become a beacon of hope for the
*21:45.880- 21:51.280* :  fame and fortune-seekers in the entertainment mecca of the world. When it was originally put up,
*21:51.280- 21:58.300* :  it read Hollywood land to lure investors in the 20s, it's since seen tragedy, many facelifts,
*21:58.540- 22:03.520* :  and various pranks. It's also been the backdrop for countless films and television shows
*22:03.520- 22:09.800* :  a decaying reminder of silver screen excess. The BBC's Sean Lace spoke to Michael Shulman,
*22:09.800- 22:14.920* :  author of Oscar Wars, a history of Hollywood in gold, sweat, and tears.
*22:15.640- 22:20.260* :  Like Hollywood, the sign is a kind of checkered history. So it started out as just a real estate
*22:20.260- 22:26.420* :  ploy. There was a hillside community that was advertising called Hollywood Lands. In 1923,
*22:26.420- 22:31.160* :  the sign said Hollywood Land, and it was only meant to be there for something like 18 months,
*22:31.280- 22:36.000* :  as a way to advertise. A lot of people thought it was an eye-sort first, partly because it used
*22:36.000- 22:40.880* :  electric lights and it actually would flash, like Hollywood Land, Hollywood Land, kind of like the
*22:40.880- 22:45.420* :  Eiffel Tower in Paris, like people sort of thought it was hideous at first, and then it kind of grew
*22:45.420- 22:50.280* :  in lore and just remained for a hundred years now. And I suppose one of the things that makes that
*22:50.280- 22:56.440* :  connection is that it has been the scene of tragedy. Yes. So in 1932, a young actress named
*22:56.440- 23:02.360* :  Peg Entwistle killed herself by leaping off of the middle of the H in Hollywood Land.
*23:02.520- 23:09.540* :  And this just became part of the lore of the sign. It was the depression and they were just tons
*23:09.540- 23:15.420* :  of people from all across America fleeing their little hometowns and trying to make it in Hollywood.
*23:15.420- 23:21.260* :  And the fact that Peg Entwistle had sort of come to fulfill her movie dreams and she'd been left
*23:21.260- 23:25.700* :  on the cutting room floor of her big breakout movie and her option was dropped and then she
*23:25.700- 23:30.040* :  leapt off the Hollywood sign. There was a lot more to her story which I won't go into and it wasn't
*23:30.040- 23:35.700* :  exactly accurate, but the idea that this happened because Hollywood can lure you and then
*23:35.700- 23:40.880* :  dash your dreams just became part of the Hollywood myth. How is the industry regarded?
*23:41.240- 23:47.020* :  Now, I mean, it was given, I think, protected status in 1973. So it's kind of had 50 happy years
*23:47.020- 23:51.640* :  where people actually do look after it and kind of revere it. I wonder how the industry regards
*23:51.640- 23:56.200* :  the sign now. What's your impression? Because you've talked to a lot of people in the film world for
*23:56.200- 24:00.900* :  your book. I think it's beloved, you know, and it's so interesting because it's first 50 years,
*24:00.900- 24:06.400* :  it was extremely not beloved. It was just deteriorating and people would try to sort of gusty it up.
*24:06.500- 24:10.840* :  To me, it's like a great symbol of Hollywood also in the sense that it's only pretty from the front.
*24:10.940- 24:14.560* :  You know, and it's too dimensional, it's like an old Hollywood movie set. If you think of like
*24:14.680- 24:19.700* :  an old west town that you poke it with your finger and the whole thing falls down because it's just
*24:19.700- 24:24.320* :  like a sleight of wood. That's sort of what it's like to me. It's this very sort of glamorous thing
*24:24.320- 24:29.300* :  that you can see from miles and miles away. I'm a New Yorker and I'm very geographically challenged
*24:29.300- 24:33.860* :  in Los Angeles, so I never know when I'm going to see it when I'm there. And whenever I do, I have
*24:33.860- 24:40.320* :  to admit I get a huge grin because it's Hollywood and it's always framed by a big boulevard of palm
*24:40.320- 24:47.180* :  trees on either side. The American writer Michael Schulman. When it first arrived in the rivers
*24:47.180- 24:53.900* :  of the Bolivian Amazon, some local people feared it was a monster. Now the Peichy, a very large
*24:53.900- 25:00.340* :  freshwater fish, has created a major fishing industry. But while it's providing a living for hundreds
*25:00.340- 25:06.100* :  of fishermen, there are fears its voracious appetite could be endangering the hundreds of different
*25:06.100- 25:11.820* :  indigenous fish which throng Bolivia's rivers. Bob Howard reports on whether this invasive
*25:11.820- 25:20.700* :  species is a blessing or a curse. I'm on a fishing boat on the Yatta River in Bolivia.
*25:21.100- 25:27.240* :  The landlots South American country, which alongside nine others like Peru and Brazil, forms part
*25:27.240- 25:33.980* :  of the huge Amazon basin. I'm with Johnny Noco, a local fisherman who makes his living catching the
*25:33.980- 25:40.620* :  Peichy, a giant carnivorous freshwater fish, which has invaded this river and others throughout
*25:40.620- 25:49.280* :  the country. When I'm in the lagoon and I see a Peichy coming up for air, I have to go very slowly
*25:49.620- 25:55.800* :  and not make any noise because they can hear the sound of the canoe and they escape. When it comes
*25:55.800- 26:03.280* :  up for air again, that's when I throw the net. Millamel Ottaparim has been a fisherman for more
*26:03.280- 26:09.160* :  than 50 years. He's had a Peichy processing plant in the northeastern city of River Alta.
*26:09.160- 26:17.400* :  To sell the fish is just caught. When the Peichy arrived, I thought this fish was a water snake
*26:18.140- 26:23.900* :  that it would attack everything. They said that it was a wild beast and eating it would be bad for you
*26:24.600- 26:30.520* :  that it might be poisonous. The Peichy is one of the biggest freshwater fishes in the world
*26:31.020- 26:37.880* :  growing up to four meters in length and weighing 200 kilograms or more. Every year, it's estimated
*26:37.880- 26:44.160* :  the Peichy expands into another 40 kilometers of the rivers in the Amazon basin, which is some
*26:44.160- 26:50.400* :  of the most diverse habitats in the world. Thera Rikol Moreno, director of the Benny Autonomous
*26:50.400- 26:56.660* :  University's Center for Aquatic Resources Research, says its size and appetite make it a serious
*26:56.660- 27:05.240* :  threat to native fish stocks. It is a territorial fish. It takes over a bowl of water and
*27:05.240- 27:11.200* :  scares off the native species. It is a serious problem. The other species flee from it.
*27:12.340- 27:17.860* :  No one really knows the exact year that the Peichy started to arrive in Bolivia, but it's generally
*27:17.860- 27:23.440* :  believed it was the result of a breach of a Peichy fish farm in Peru with a fish in native,
*27:23.440- 27:30.620* :  which led them to being released into Bolivia's rivers. Fernando Cabajal is a biologist and expert
*27:30.620- 27:37.860* :  on the Peichy. During the first years of life, Peichy grew another rate of 10 kilograms a year.
*27:38.000- 27:43.200* :  That means that the Peichy is eating a lot of fish. Unlike other predatory fish like the piranha,
*27:43.200- 27:49.940* :  it doesn't have big razor-shop teeth. Instead, it hoves up fish like a giant vacuum cleaner.
*27:50.380- 27:53.780* :  At the same time, it frightens off any fish which try to eat its own young.
*27:56.220- 28:02.520* :  However, for local fishermen, it's been a boon. It's in Susano, runs a Peichy processing plant
*28:02.520- 28:08.280* :  in River Alta. Actualmente, el Peichy se venden. We sell it everywhere. Supermarkets,
*28:08.280- 28:14.480* :  markets, we buy and process around 30,000 kilograms per month. As well as providing employment,
*28:14.480- 28:20.600* :  the Peichy is also a healthy form of protein for Bolivians. Scientists like Federico Moreno
*28:20.600- 28:27.140* :  hope that fishing will keep Peichy numbers in check and protect Bolivia's extraordinary biodiversity.
*28:27.960- 28:33.660* :  Impensara casarlo. Keep fishing for them all the time and that could keep a balance between the
*28:33.660- 28:39.580* :  different species. Federico Moreno ending that report by Bob Howard. Often, when families gather
*28:39.580- 28:45.060* :  over this festive period, they spend quite a lot of time playing games. For as long as there
*28:45.060- 28:49.620* :  have been people, there have been games, and quite a lot of games come down to mathematics.
*28:49.820- 28:56.080* :  Marcus de Sotoi is a professor of maths from Oxford University. He loves them so much. He's written
*28:56.080- 29:00.900* :  a new book called Around the World in 80 Games. He told Paul Henley more.
*29:01.460- 29:06.600* :  I think it's also a way of getting to know all the places that I visit around the world for my
*29:06.600- 29:11.320* :  mathematical research. Tell me the game you play and I'll tell you who you are. I think games
*29:11.320- 29:18.080* :  are a wonderful insight into the culture, the people, the history of the places I visit for my work.
*29:18.460- 29:23.700* :  I've been collecting games as I've traveled the world for many decades, and this book is sort of
*29:23.700- 29:28.200* :  bringing all the things I've discovered on those journeys together into one volume.
*29:28.460- 29:33.760* :  There are indeed games that characterize parts of the world, aren't there, like bits of Africa,
*29:33.760- 29:40.300* :  Mancala. Mancala is a wonderful game which I think is very distinctive to Africa, and what's
*29:40.300- 29:46.020* :  interesting as well is how this game varies across the continent. So you have kind of simple
*29:46.020- 29:51.420* :  versions, which are just sort of two lines of pits with stones in, but you can get very complicated
*29:51.420- 29:58.240* :  versions with four lines of the ability to recede stones in. It's one of the great strategy games
*29:58.240- 30:04.540* :  that humanity has come up with. I'd say alongside chess and the Chinese game of go.
*30:04.860- 30:08.940* :  You have a special respect, don't you, for a Western family favourite monopoly?
*30:10.360- 30:14.060* :  Well, I absolutely hate monopoly. I think it's a very high level game.
*30:14.700- 30:19.700* :  I think it's a highly flawed game, but I can't understand why it's everyone's game a choice
*30:19.700- 30:24.940* :  at this time of year. For me, one of the important factors of a game, which make it a good game,
*30:24.940- 30:28.860* :  is that it shouldn't finish before it ends. So right up to the last moment,
*30:29.360- 30:34.160* :  anybody should still be able to win, and I think monopoly finishes about one-third into the game,
*30:34.160- 30:40.140* :  and two-thirds of the time is spent with one person bankrupting everybody else, and it's also a very
*30:40.140- 30:45.900* :  long game, which I think is also a fault for a game. In backgammon, there is not just maths,
*30:45.960- 30:50.520* :  but a heavy sprinkling of luck, isn't it? Yeah, and I think this is important for a game. I think
*30:50.520- 30:55.420* :  you need a balance of strategy and luck, because if it's just a pure strategy game,
*30:55.420- 30:59.360* :  then if somebody's good at the game, they're always going to win. So that's another of my rules
*30:59.360- 31:04.640* :  for a good game. It shouldn't finish before it starts. So I think having an element of luck actually
*31:04.640- 31:10.240* :  allows a beginner, or somebody is a slightly weaker player, a chance to win. But I don't want
*31:10.240- 31:15.300* :  a game which is just pure luck, because then you can't express yourself. You want some agency.
*31:15.360- 31:20.860* :  So I think backgammon is almost the perfect game for having this lovely balance between,
*31:20.860- 31:26.200* :  yeah, chances there, because the throw of the dice will determine your go. But what you do with
*31:26.200- 31:31.140* :  those dice also means that you're expressing your strategy. Are you an aggressive player, a risky
*31:31.140- 31:36.180* :  player, defensive player? And also this game is wonderful, because it's got its heritage in one of
*31:36.180- 31:41.420* :  the oldest board games in history, which is a 5,000-year-old game that you can find in the British
*31:41.420- 31:47.500* :  Museum in London, which comes from Mesopotamia. The other strategy game that I think is one that's
*31:47.500- 31:51.900* :  fascinating from a mathematical point of view is this ancient game of go, which is black and white
*31:51.900- 31:58.080* :  stones put down on a 19 by 19 grid. It's so simple yet. The games that evolve are so complex,
*31:58.140- 32:03.660* :  and it was a game that was very challenging to write code for a computer to play. And I think it's
*32:03.660- 32:08.500* :  one of the examples of the impact of the new AI that we're seeing and machine learning, that it
*32:08.500- 32:15.080* :  took to 2016 for a computer to really match what a human can do at this game. Professor Marcus
*32:15.080- 32:22.820* :  Tosatoi speaking to Paul Henley. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition
*32:22.820- 32:28.420* :  of the Global News Podcast later. This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and the producer
*32:28.420- 32:34.240* :  was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Rachel Wright. Until next time, goodbye.
