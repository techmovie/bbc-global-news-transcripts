*00:00.060- 00:04.040* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service
*00:04.040- 00:08.740* :  with reports and analysis from across the world, the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.600* :  BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:43.600- 00:48.040* :  We've been sending them for more than two decades, but for the people living in Neolocent,
*00:48.040- 00:52.400* :  a Norwegian town on the Stalbart Archipelago, it's only just become possible.
*00:53.020- 00:57.640* :  I received text messages from them the very first day just to test that we are actually alive.
*00:58.880- 01:03.920* :  It has been a very positive response for that they are having a normal life.
*01:09.020- 01:11.400* :  Hello, this is the Happy Pot, I'm Harry Bly.
*01:11.740- 01:15.400* :  In China, here how makeshift buildings constructed during the pandemic
*01:15.400- 01:17.980* :  are being repurposed into homes and shelters.
*01:18.580- 01:21.240* :  The company in Slovenia turning a pesky plant.
*01:21.380- 01:29.740* :  A huge, very dense bushy plant, about 12 feet tall and there is a lot of it.
*01:30.060- 01:33.900* :  Into something more useful, and we look back at one of the lesser known,
*01:33.980- 01:37.780* :  but important sporting events of the year, the special Olympics.
*01:38.500- 01:43.880* :  We're in 190 countries and as a person who's been a part of the leadership team for a long time,
*01:43.880- 01:47.200* :  I feel like it's given me a front row seat for the best in humanity.
*01:47.680- 01:52.040* :  All this and more to come on the Happy Pot from the BBC World Service.
*01:58.660- 02:03.540* :  We begin in the town of Neolocent, one of the world's northernmost permanent settlements.
*02:03.580- 02:06.920* :  It's located on the Norwegian Archipelago Stalbart,
*02:07.340- 02:11.060* :  and to give you an idea of how far away it is from the rest of Norway,
*02:11.060- 02:15.920* :  the town is 1000 kilometres closer to the north pole than it is to Oslo.
*02:16.340- 02:19.300* :  In the summer, the town has a population of around 200,
*02:19.840- 02:22.440* :  many of whom are scientists researching climate and space.
*02:23.140- 02:26.920* :  Last month, it became the last town in Norway to get mobile coverage,
*02:27.560- 02:29.960* :  but the town hasn't been left behind with all technology.
*02:30.500- 02:33.380* :  They have internet there, but only through a wired connection.
*02:33.900- 02:37.360* :  Wireless networks have always been banned, so it's not to mess with the delicate
*02:37.740- 02:40.960* :  scientific monitoring equipment used by research laboratories.
*02:41.820- 02:45.100* :  Talks to get mobile coverage began back in 2001,
*02:45.760- 02:48.120* :  and now that it's established 22 years later,
*02:48.120- 02:52.220* :  it means the residents of Neolocent can use text and calling services
*02:52.620- 02:53.640* :  like the rest of the world.
*02:54.260- 02:55.760* :  Julie Tromborg is one of them.
*02:56.480- 03:01.400* :  To be yet honest, it's been making life easier, I have to say.
*03:02.040- 03:04.460* :  But we were, of course, a bit concerned at the start,
*03:04.460- 03:06.680* :  because this is a special place.
*03:06.680- 03:08.600* :  It's a very tight community.
*03:09.320- 03:12.380* :  You're far away from others, so the social life is very important.
*03:14.440- 03:17.420* :  And, of course, we were a bit worried that it would impact the social life
*03:17.740- 03:19.020* :  that people would sit with their phone.
*03:19.860- 03:22.380* :  But that hadn't been a problem so far, luckily.
*03:22.960- 03:27.000* :  Who was the first person you sent a text to when the mobile signal started?
*03:27.660- 03:28.040* :  My mother.
*03:30.740- 03:34.100* :  Julie Tromborg, speaking to me on her newly enabled mobile phone.
*03:34.760- 03:38.320* :  Christian Scottun is the chief executive of the telecoms company
*03:38.320- 03:39.700* :  Teleno in Svalbard.
*03:40.040- 03:42.220* :  I spoke to him from his office in Longibian.
*03:42.760- 03:47.500* :  It's a settlement which can house about 200, 250 people,
*03:48.420- 03:52.360* :  mainly researchers, mainly for economic research,
*03:52.360- 03:56.360* :  because it's so rural and so outside everything.
*03:56.360- 04:01.320* :  So you can, you know, radio pollution, no light pollution.
*04:01.800- 04:05.280* :  So it's a very good place for observing towards space.
*04:06.600- 04:09.200* :  In the wintertime, it's only about 40 people living there.
*04:09.260- 04:11.640* :  It's in the summer when the research is going on,
*04:11.720- 04:15.020* :  and the station is manned when we are up to about 200.
*04:15.740- 04:20.480* :  And why has it taken so long for mobile service to become a thing there?
*04:21.240- 04:27.120* :  There is a site there of certain importance to listening to things in outer space.
*04:28.420- 04:33.820* :  It has been a concern that a mobile network could make disturbances to those signals.
*04:34.720- 04:37.220* :  So that was an assumption made very early.
*04:37.360- 04:40.760* :  And since then, it hasn't been followed up very closely.
*04:41.160- 04:44.380* :  And also mobile signals, the way we do mobile today,
*04:44.380- 04:47.440* :  is slightly different from what we did 20 years ago.
*04:47.720- 04:51.760* :  It has been more ruggedized, more resilient, we had better control.
*04:52.660- 04:55.100* :  So today, we know exactly what we are doing, so to say.
*04:55.400- 05:00.800* :  And also that in this area, it is protected from the use of frequencies
*05:01.220- 05:02.280* :  about two gigahertz.
*05:02.920- 05:05.400* :  So we have to stay on the frequency bands below there.
*05:06.120- 05:09.140* :  For example, WiFi and Bluetooth is not legal.
*05:09.180- 05:12.580* :  So you have to switch off all WiFi and Bluetooth devices when you are there,
*05:13.020- 05:16.880* :  because there is a risk that those frequencies can disturb this site.
*05:17.920- 05:22.320* :  But for mobile signals, which are quite robust and are very strict control,
*05:22.800- 05:24.920* :  and don't make much disturbances to its surroundings,
*05:25.900- 05:27.220* :  that would quite save to use.
*05:27.960- 05:30.160* :  So what does this mean for people living there?
*05:30.160- 05:32.420* :  How did they communicate before this?
*05:33.440- 05:35.180* :  Before this, we have a fiber connection up there,
*05:35.220- 05:38.700* :  so they had fixed access through a regular cable in the wall.
*05:39.640- 05:44.200* :  So for them, it was more all of those things we do through a mobile network,
*05:44.680- 05:47.280* :  typically banking and so on, and also to be mobile,
*05:47.500- 05:51.940* :  actually not being linked to your disk to be able to make a call or communicate.
*05:53.280- 05:59.240* :  They had this great opportunity that they could benefit from the experiences we have elsewhere,
*05:59.580- 06:03.040* :  how do you develop a good culture for use of mobile?
*06:03.860- 06:06.700* :  They have had the privilege of talking to each other,
*06:06.960- 06:10.920* :  not people facing down in their mobile phone every day, like the rest of us does.
*06:11.720- 06:15.040* :  So when they knew that they will have a mobile network coming,
*06:15.240- 06:20.740* :  they have this golden opportunity to develop culture for how to use a mobile phone.
*06:21.060- 06:21.920* :  Where do you use it?
*06:21.980- 06:25.320* :  Like mobile free zones where they are dining and so on,
*06:26.180- 06:31.440* :  to keep some of that good social relationship thing, which they always had up there,
*06:32.140- 06:34.580* :  but in the same time be a modern community.
*06:35.380- 06:39.480* :  I hope they keep on building a healthy mobile culture.
*06:39.520- 06:41.660* :  Maybe the rest of us can learn something from that as well.
*06:42.040- 06:43.180* :  Yes, I think so.
*06:43.900- 06:45.860* :  And have you heard from any of the residents?
*06:45.920- 06:48.800* :  Have they given their reactions to having this new technology,
*06:48.800- 06:52.240* :  so to speak, being able to send texts and calls?
*06:53.380- 06:57.060* :  So far, I have received several very positive responses.
*06:57.060- 07:00.380* :  Of course, I received text messages from them the very first day,
*07:00.460- 07:02.600* :  just to test that we are actually alive.
*07:03.720- 07:07.600* :  It has been a very positive response for that they are having a,
*07:07.940- 07:12.500* :  let's say, normal life, like using FaceTime, like you and I doing now, for example.
*07:13.320- 07:16.680* :  It's something we take for granted and you don't really know what you are missing
*07:16.680- 07:17.860* :  until you don't have it.
*07:18.560- 07:21.080* :  Christian Scotun from Tellinor Svalbard.
*07:22.280- 07:26.860* :  How to turn a symbol of sickness and confinement into something positive.
*07:27.340- 07:31.720* :  During the coronavirus pandemic, China constructed a lot of buildings that were used as
*07:31.720- 07:37.500* :  makeshift hospitals or state quarantine centres, places where people had to stay if they
*07:37.500- 07:42.520* :  tested positive. Now, though, they're being repurposed as our China media analyst,
*07:42.600- 07:43.820* :  Kerry Allen, explains.
*07:45.020- 07:49.220* :  During the global pandemic, people in many urban areas of China became very familiar with
*07:49.220- 07:53.060* :  what are known as Fung Tsung. Literally, translators as shelters,
*07:53.060- 07:58.220* :  these were large blocks of quickly erected studios, complete with a bedroom and a small bathroom,
*07:58.220- 08:02.180* :  that people were isolated in if they tested positive for COVID-19.
*08:02.900- 08:05.740* :  And I should mention that people were housed in these not by choice,
*08:06.180- 08:09.360* :  but because China had a strict zero COVID policy in place.
*08:10.180- 08:15.040* :  But now, a year on from China ending these measures, an opportunity has been recognised that
*08:15.040- 08:18.560* :  there's the potential to turn some of these units into affordable housing.
*08:19.460- 08:24.320* :  In Beijing, a shelter with more than 4,900 of these rooms has been turned into a community
*08:24.320- 08:29.040* :  of brightly coloured affordable rental homes. Another in the city has been turned into a
*08:29.040- 08:33.720* :  use hostel, and some have been earmarked as resettlement housing for people affected by natural
*08:33.720- 08:38.580* :  disasters. This is not just happening in Beijing, but in other parts of the country too.
*08:39.280- 08:43.480* :  In a city called Lin Xia in Northwest in Gansu Province, some of these shelters,
*08:44.000- 08:47.820* :  which have been standing empty for some time, have very quickly been put to use this temporary
*08:47.820- 08:51.500* :  housing for people affected by an earthquake in the province earlier in the week.
*08:52.460- 08:56.420* :  As it was for most people in the world, the pandemic was a dark period for a lot of people in
*08:56.420- 09:01.880* :  China, but three years of mass testing and strict lockdown measures meant that these huge shelters
*09:01.880- 09:07.260* :  were generally seen as something to be feared. So on the social network, Weibo, many young Chinese
*09:07.260- 09:11.800* :  have been praising these new housing units for rewriting a new chapter in China's history,
*09:12.320- 09:15.980* :  turning something that might have been associated with bad memories into something good,
*09:16.800- 09:20.700* :  and it's not just happening with these shelters either. In many major cities,
*09:20.700- 09:25.080* :  it was common to see testing boots where people could get their COVID-19 test in order
*09:25.080- 09:29.620* :  that they could continue going to work or school, and many of these have since been turned into
*09:29.620- 09:34.840* :  places for young local craftsmen to display their goods. Others have become places for sanitation
*09:34.840- 09:39.620* :  workers, laborers to rest, and factoring in that it's very cold in much of China at the moment,
*09:40.060- 09:41.760* :  these have likewise been warmly welcomed.
*09:43.240- 09:43.760* :  Kerry Allen
*09:44.420- 09:49.020* :  Now, you might have heard of Japanese knotweed. It's a plant that's one of the most invasive
*09:49.020- 09:54.160* :  species which grows and spreads rapidly. It's been known to cause havoc in people's gardens
*09:54.160- 10:00.180* :  all over the world, with its incredibly strong and durable roots that can not only kill other plants,
*10:00.180- 10:05.600* :  but can damage concrete foundations and buildings. It's not easy to get rid of either.
*10:05.940- 10:09.940* :  Japanese knotweed needs strong chemicals or extensive digging up to remove it.
*10:10.960- 10:15.660* :  Now, a design company, Triner, in the Slovenian capital Lubljana, has been using the invasive
*10:15.660- 10:20.940* :  plants to make it into something more useful, paper. The project's called knotweed,
*10:21.460- 10:25.720* :  without the K, as in knot a weed. Zoe Gelber has been finding out more.
*10:26.340- 10:30.680* :  We normally talk about invasive plants as something that we need to eradicate and move away
*10:30.860- 10:36.180* :  out of our communities and environments. Gaya is a designer and is one of the co-founders of Triner.
*10:36.880- 10:40.680* :  They first started thinking about designing with invasive species eight years ago.
*10:41.100- 10:48.160* :  What we are trying to kind of push forward is to embrace their presence in a way and try to
*10:48.680- 10:55.120* :  get to know them also from their kind of beneficial uses, let's say. So that took us to
*10:55.120- 11:01.940* :  to these ideas of exploring their potential for paper production. Since 2017, every April,
*11:01.940- 11:05.740* :  they gathered together volunteers to pick Japanese knotweed around the city,
*11:05.740- 11:11.140* :  which they then process into paper. Gaya walked me through the process, starting with showing
*11:11.140- 11:15.820* :  me the knotweed that grows on their site. So this is all Japanese knotweed here?
*11:16.100- 11:26.340* :  Yeah. Okay, wow. It's just like a huge, very dense, bushy plant, about 12 feet tall,
*11:27.200- 11:33.200* :  and there is a lot of it. People say that it resembles bamboo in a way because of a stem structure
*11:33.200- 11:39.460* :  and also the hollow stems that it has. Like bamboo, knotweed is known for growing incredibly
*11:39.460- 11:44.860* :  quickly in huge bushes. With big heart shaped leaves and ornate white flowers, it's hard to
*11:44.860- 11:49.900* :  imagine this peaceful looking plant. As the fearsome adversary, it's so often made out to be.
*11:50.880- 11:55.700* :  When I saw it, it was green and full of leaves, but Gaya and the team gathered the stems when they're dry.
*11:59.340- 12:03.820* :  These are then shredded into smaller pieces and put through a paper mill, which continues to
*12:03.820- 12:08.580* :  break down the plant fibers. Andrei, Gaya's co-founder, showed me how it worked.
*12:09.300- 12:13.540* :  At the end, we come to a paper pot that it's like this.
*12:15.600- 12:22.640* :  It looks like a kind of brown soupy. It's just like a brownish broccoli soup. It's nothing
*12:22.640- 12:30.740* :  else. It's just a fibrous broccoli soup. At factory in the city, this pulp is sprayed onto fine mesh
*12:30.840- 12:35.520* :  and then put through huge industrial rollers to produce big rolls of white Japanese knotweed
*12:35.520- 12:40.760* :  paper. Andrei showed me the finished product. Does it come out of this tone or do you bleach it?
*12:41.060- 12:47.820* :  It's really different because every batch has a different color. Okay, nice. So it's like
*12:47.820- 12:56.940* :  wine every batch has its own properties and colors. Currently, knotweed is producing around 500
*12:56.940- 13:02.500* :  kilos of paper every year from its annual foraging events. It's still very much a small scale project.
*13:03.200- 13:07.680* :  But Gaya and Andrei hope that their world first knotweed paper will inspire others to do
*13:07.680- 13:12.700* :  the same and start to see the invasive weeds around us as something that can benefit the wider
*13:12.700- 13:18.080* :  community. So our idea is definitely to present knotweed as a potential resource,
*13:18.880- 13:25.200* :  but it's really important also that through this brand that we do, that we also have an opportunity
*13:25.200- 13:31.780* :  to introduce some other ways of engaging with production of goods that can serve the local
*13:31.780- 13:37.600* :  community but also their ecology. Zoe Gelber and you can hear more about Japanese knotweed and
*13:37.600- 13:42.440* :  other stories like this from our friends at People Fixing the World on the BBC World Service
*13:42.440- 13:47.980* :  or online. If you heard our edition on Christmas Day, we caught up with some of our colleagues
*13:47.980- 13:53.580* :  from around the newsroom and asked them to look back on their highlights of 2023. Well, in this
*13:53.580- 13:58.180* :  podcast as we approach the new year, let's have a look forward to some of the stories to expect
*13:58.180- 14:05.640* :  in 2024. He is our music correspondent, Mark Savage. Looking ahead to the music of 2024,
*14:05.640- 14:11.140* :  I think there's no escaping the fact that Taylor Swift is still in the middle of her imperial phase.
*14:11.680- 14:17.380* :  Her record-breaking eras tour is going to move from America to Asia and Australia and Europe,
*14:17.860- 14:23.280* :  and I think we're just going to continue to see those scenes of hysteria around everything she does.
*14:23.280- 14:29.480* :  But in terms of new music, there's one artist I'm really interested in for 2024 and her name is
*14:29.620- 14:35.040* :  Tyler. She's from South Africa and she's just had a massive hit with a song called Water.
*14:43.620- 14:49.300* :  Gone viral on TikTok, it's had more than 1.2 billion views, she's been nominated for a Grammy
*14:49.880- 14:54.540* :  and she is the first solo artist from South Africa to have a hit on the US charts
*14:54.540- 15:00.700* :  for 55 years. That's really significant because South African artists just haven't been able to
*15:00.700- 15:06.260* :  achieve that kind of global success before. But what Tyler has is this really accessible sign.
*15:06.260- 15:11.440* :  She's taken Amapiano with a very popular African genre that mixes house and
*15:11.440- 15:18.240* :  queto bass lines, reggae and dub and she's fused it with the pop and r&b that she grew up loving,
*15:18.240- 15:23.740* :  you know, artists like Chris Bryan and Rihanna and she's made something that is completely unique
*15:23.740- 15:37.640* :  to her but also incredibly compelling. She grew up in Johannesburg and she's wanted to be famous
*15:37.640- 15:42.780* :  from a very young age. She used to steal her dad's phone so she could post videos to Instagram
*15:43.200- 15:47.160* :  and she was messaging people like Drake and DJ Khaled hoping to get their attention.
*15:47.880- 15:52.720* :  That didn't quite work but it did help her find a manager who put her in the studio and
*15:52.880- 15:57.760* :  helped her write a song called Getting Lit. The video for that went massive in South Africa
*15:57.900- 16:04.060* :  and it attracted the attention of Sylvia Roan. She is a legendary music executive in America who
*16:04.060- 16:08.600* :  worked at Motown who's been part of the success story of people like Travis Scott and Mary J.
*16:08.600- 16:15.480* :  Blige and Simply Red. She hired a billboard in Johannesburg, put Tyler's face on it and added the
*16:15.480- 16:22.220* :  message to Tyler with love from Sylvia and it's easy to see why she got so enthusiastic about
*16:22.220- 16:29.140* :  this young 21-year-old artist. She is so charismatic. She has such a beautiful soulful voice
*16:29.540- 16:34.800* :  and she's got the songwriting chops to match it. Not only that but she's hugely ambitious.
*16:35.380- 16:39.300* :  Here's what she said about her plans for global domination. I mean,
*16:40.100- 16:45.100* :  my goal has always been the same and it's been to be one of the biggest pop stars and
*16:45.520- 16:50.020* :  being a pop star from the continent Africa you know that's always been a goal of mine.
*16:50.360- 16:54.380* :  I feel like people are going to be like where did this girl come from? People are not ready.
*16:55.260- 16:57.240* :  So I can't wait to see what she does next.
*17:00.100- 17:04.500* :  Mark Savage and later in the program will hear from Nigel Adley on his thoughts for the year
*17:04.500- 17:05.940* :  ahead in the world of sport.
*17:11.300- 17:12.500* :  Coming up in this podcast.
*17:19.100- 17:24.360* :  The man composing music based on social media comments, don't worry, they're nice ones.
*17:33.420- 17:37.180* :  Do you ever pass someone in the street and wonder what's their story?
*17:37.300- 17:41.280* :  I was a very traumatized kid. Everything was about wanting to be long.
*17:41.480- 17:44.940* :  Live's Less Ordinary is the podcast where people share their experiences.
*17:46.620- 17:47.620* :  Their dreams.
*17:47.620- 17:53.700* :  I wanted to see what would a shop for shot remake of Raiders of Lost Ark with kids look like.
*17:53.940- 17:55.060* :  And their secrets.
*17:55.500- 17:56.700* :  I was almost a school shooter.
*17:57.340- 18:02.980* :  Unmissible stories from around the globe. Live's Less Ordinary from the BBC World Service.
*18:03.900- 18:06.000* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:07.140- 18:11.220* :  We're looking back now at one of this year's sporting events for people with disabilities.
*18:11.340- 18:16.440* :  The special Olympics is the world's largest sports organisation for children and adults
*18:16.440- 18:20.360* :  with intellectual disabilities. And this year's summer games were in Berlin.
*18:25.980- 18:42.640* :  My name is Liam Stewart. I am from Atlanta, Georgia and I do soccer over
*18:43.840- 18:46.000* :  for Unified Cop for the USA.
*18:47.260- 18:52.940* :  From my experiences with special Olympics and any kind of sport that I was involved with,
*18:53.120- 18:57.860* :  I've learned about friendship and communication and trustworthiness.
*18:58.900- 19:04.660* :  So Huda Raib is saying she is an orphan. She is in a second year industrial
*19:04.660- 19:11.040* :  technician in knitting department and she is a multi-tasking person.
*19:14.020- 19:18.260* :  She should do a lot of sports while studying.
*19:19.180- 19:24.860* :  Liam Stewart from Team USA and Norma Seud speaking on behalf of Huda Shalabi from Team Egypt.
*19:25.200- 19:31.720* :  The special Olympics was founded in the US state of Maryland in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver.
*19:31.980- 19:35.780* :  It began as a day camp called Camp Shriver for children with disabilities.
*19:36.420- 19:42.160* :  Now there are five million participants from 172 countries taking part in the summer
*19:42.160- 19:48.140* :  and winter games. I spoke to the founder's son and now Chairman of the Special Olympics, Timothy
*19:48.140- 19:54.640* :  Shriver. The special Olympics is the most inspiring joyful, positive, hopeful life-changing movement
*19:54.640- 20:01.460* :  in the world today and I'm biased but I believe that to be true. It's a movement of and for people
*20:01.460- 20:05.560* :  with intellectual and developmental differences but it's also a movement from them. People with
*20:05.560- 20:10.320* :  intellectual disabilities are in every community, they're in every country and every village and
*20:10.320- 20:16.420* :  town. So it's an invitation from them. It comes into a world where what matters most is how brave
*20:16.420- 20:22.740* :  and how courageous and how hard you try. We're in 190 countries and as a person who's been a part
*20:22.740- 20:27.340* :  of the leadership team for a long time I feel like it's given me a front row seat for the best in
*20:27.340- 20:32.840* :  humanity. It's really spectacular and tell me about you, tell me how you got involved and started
*20:32.840- 20:38.440* :  this. Well my mom was involved in the founding of the movement. She was running summer camps for
*20:38.440- 20:44.240* :  people with intellectual challenges in the 1960s and so I grew up learning to play with people
*20:44.240- 20:48.540* :  who were different before I learned that they were different and this is the message in some ways
*20:48.540- 20:53.620* :  of our movement before you form your judgments of people, before you start to label people,
*20:53.760- 20:59.420* :  before you get afraid of people who are different. Why not try playing first? Why not try taking
*20:59.420- 21:04.640* :  to the playing field? That's why schools are so important to us because if we can get very young
*21:04.640- 21:09.380* :  children involved in what we call unified sports where children with and without intellectual
*21:09.380- 21:16.280* :  challenges play on teams together what we find is they're not afraid. And this year's games it was
*21:16.280- 21:22.100* :  it was quite a momentous location wasn't it? We were in the Berlin stadium for the world summer
*21:22.100- 21:27.540* :  games that had all Hitler present for the 1936 Olympics. There hadn't been an Olympic
*21:27.540- 21:34.020* :  Quarch in that stadium since 1936 but this time Quarch was carried in by the very people who
*21:34.020- 21:39.780* :  would have been scorned and humiliated and even killed in 1936 people with intellectual
*21:39.780- 21:43.880* :  disabilities from all over the world and they came into that stadium in the country of Germany
*21:43.880- 21:49.780* :  and the city of Berlin and all of Europe really cheered. I mean people were tear streaming down our
*21:49.780- 21:57.120* :  faces and we I think inaugurated a whole new energy field there that was all about a culture of
*21:57.120- 22:05.480* :  welcome for everyone. And for you what were the highlights of these games? It's hard to overstate
*22:05.480- 22:11.600* :  walking on that track during the opening ceremonies. It's hard to overstate being there with Sena.
*22:11.960- 22:17.440* :  She's a young woman who was on this special Olympics team from Pakistan. A film had been made
*22:17.440- 22:22.780* :  just prior to the games about her life that showed her locked in a chain every morning in her own
*22:22.780- 22:28.160* :  home and she carried the torch into that stadium. You know he ran right through the stop sign.
*22:28.160- 22:32.720* :  You know you're she was supposed to stop at a certain point she just kept running and I just couldn't
*22:32.720- 22:42.080* :  I couldn't believe my I saw a woman bursting with joy 60,000 people cheering for her embracing
*22:42.080- 22:48.100* :  the world. How does someone do that? How do you feel and experience so much scorn and so much
*22:48.100- 22:54.540* :  humiliation and so much discrimination and so much injustice and turn with a smile on your face
*22:54.540- 22:59.760* :  and welcome all the joy and create all the joy the world needs to overcome its fears.
*22:59.760- 23:06.040* :  It was an extraordinary moment. I can't quite describe it but to meet her afterwards you see that
*23:06.040- 23:11.580* :  smile to hear her speak about how important it is for others to get involved in sport was
*23:11.580- 23:17.760* :  really quite extraordinary. Timothy Shriver, let's stay with sport now and look ahead to 2024
*23:17.760- 23:28.280* :  his Nigel Adely. Paris 24 Los Angeles 20th. All eyes will be on Paris in 2024 and after the French
*23:28.280- 23:35.720* :  capital as host of the Olympics the largest ever para Olympics will take center stage with 4,400
*23:35.720- 23:42.120* :  athletes and anticipated 3 million tickets sold and so many remarkable stories.
*23:43.300- 23:49.960* :  Before the 2016 games day a young critic was struggling with depression and anxiety but after
*23:49.960- 23:55.480* :  reaching out for help and the support of her family the US sprinter recovered to win gold
*23:55.500- 24:03.800* :  in both the 100 and 200 meters in Rio. She took a break after the Tokyo Games to prioritize her
*24:03.800- 24:10.460* :  mental health but Deiert will be back in Paris as a Paralympic mum following the birth of her
*24:10.460- 24:17.040* :  daughter Saia Ray in 2022 hoping to join the long list of medallist mothers at the games.
*24:18.800- 24:26.180* :  Euro 2024 in Germany will dominate the football agenda in Europe. People love football in Germany
*24:26.180- 24:32.300* :  and of course we all can't wait to have all the countries and our and our fantastic stadiums.
*24:33.700- 24:40.100* :  And offers Jude Bellingham another chance to show off his prodigious talent. I commented on him
*24:40.100- 24:46.060* :  when he was outstanding for Birmingham in the English Second Division at the age of just 16
*24:46.800- 24:53.140* :  and the guidance of loving parents determined to ensure humility was as important as his football
*24:53.800- 24:59.280* :  has produced a grounded individual who was now in the demanding environment of Real Madrid
*25:00.000- 25:05.940* :  and is one of the best young players in the world. With Bellingham playing well England's men
*25:05.940- 25:15.080* :  could end their long wait for glory. Finally back to Paris 2024 and a story which may not end in
*25:15.080- 25:22.980* :  an Olympic gold medal but has reunited a nation. South Sudan is best known for the ruinous civil war
*25:23.400- 25:29.640* :  which ripped the country apart following independence but its basketball team are looking to create
*25:29.640- 25:36.220* :  a more positive narrative. The country doesn't even have an indoor stadium and the team began its
*25:36.220- 25:43.020* :  journey on concrete courts in neighbouring Kenya but helped by the former NBA star Louis Woldeng
*25:43.020- 25:50.340* :  who became a refugee after fleeing the country as a child. The team began a fairytale run which
*25:50.340- 25:56.920* :  ended with qualification for the Olympics as Africa's top team. Thousand filled the streets of
*25:56.920- 26:03.320* :  the capital Juba to welcome the players home. A wallet squad of refugees and the children of
*26:03.320- 26:09.020* :  refugees will find it tough at the very highest level. They've given the people in South Sudan
*26:09.100- 26:12.940* :  a moment of joy and hope to carry into the New Year.
*26:13.080- 26:18.660* :  Nigel Adely
*26:19.500- 26:25.160* :  We love to end this podcast with some music. Earlier this month Julian Showman caught our
*26:25.640- 26:31.540* :  ears when he started posting short compositions on TikTok. He writes and performs melodies that
*26:31.540- 26:38.000* :  illustrate comments left by other users on his videos. His example try to imagine what picture
*26:38.000- 26:51.980* :  the music is painting. This was a comment that imagines a dog floating in space trying to bite
*26:52.060- 26:57.900* :  a nearby asteroid and then there's this, a bird walking around a railway station.
*27:09.860- 27:13.740* :  When the bird accidentally boards a train which then starts moving
*27:20.160- 27:25.600* :  I spoke to Julian and asked him how he comes up with these songs from just a short line of text.
*27:26.300- 27:31.820* :  People commented a lot of things so I had like a lot of ideas to work with. I'll go in and I'll
*27:31.820- 27:39.740* :  find one that I feel can be expanded upon and I'll just kind of start thinking through like
*27:40.780- 27:45.200* :  you know I'll get like a rough story in mind like a reason one I did was like an ogre wanting to
*27:45.200- 27:55.560* :  learn ballet. So I kind of started it off like the ogres like going through the town and he's
*27:55.560- 28:02.060* :  all angry at everyone you know doing his ogre thing you know secretly we learn about him that like
*28:02.060- 28:08.140* :  oh he really wants to dance but you know he feels like he can't do it because he's such a grumpy
*28:08.140- 28:15.460* :  angry ogre there's like this waltz that starts and it's kind of like supposed to give this idea of
*28:15.460- 28:22.640* :  like like a like a teaching sort of air to it and so she's like okay here here's the steps and you
*28:22.640- 28:27.480* :  know of course you can do it really well because she's a she's the instructor and then the ogre
*28:27.480- 28:32.500* :  tries it he messes up so that's that kind of back and forth thing but then as he's trying it and
*28:32.940- 28:38.420* :  it starts to come together starts to come together and then like finally the end he's like wow
*28:38.420- 28:41.180* :  I'm doing a dancing I'm here I am
*28:55.320- 29:00.380* :  this one was a was actually a very short comment an ogre that wants to learn ballet but it's too
*29:00.380- 29:05.420* :  clumsy at first there's another one you've done which it received just under three million
*29:05.420- 29:10.620* :  views on TikTok which is a huge number and this is a one that really caught our attention and the
*29:10.620- 29:16.160* :  prompt is when a puppy sees grass for the first time maybe some barks with excitement
*29:33.660- 29:38.340* :  what you do with the piano is amazing because you you you almost emulate a dog's bark a friendly
*29:39.300- 29:43.660* :  with the high pitched keys talk me through that piece yeah wanted it to have that that playful
*29:44.520- 29:53.320* :  atmosphere the puppy barking so if it were an angry dog you know with a vicious bark it might have
*29:53.320- 29:59.040* :  been of like a more dissonant chord and and maybe down lower in the register of the piano but
*29:59.980- 30:05.780* :  to make the bark more like a puppy it's up in the higher register of the piano so it's like a
*30:06.040- 30:10.800* :  playful you know like a puppy might bark at the grass and it's kind of like whoa what's this what's
*30:10.800- 30:16.400* :  this and then there's this kind of like you know a joyful kind of like oh I want to be a part of it
*30:16.400- 30:22.680* :  I want to roll around in it well one thing I've noticed is that people really especially enjoy them
*30:22.720- 30:29.120* :  if there's somehow an animal in it anytime that there's like an animal especially like you know
*30:29.120- 30:36.580* :  this one was with a puppy yeah it it it really helps which makes sense musician Julian
*30:36.580- 30:41.980* :  Showming speaking to me from his home studio in the American state of Maryland and Julian kindly
