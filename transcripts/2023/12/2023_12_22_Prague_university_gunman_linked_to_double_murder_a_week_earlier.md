*01:17.140- 01:21.560* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is being recorded at 14 hours GMT on Friday,
*01:21.560- 01:26.200* :  the 22nd of December. Police in the Czech Republic say the gunman who carried out a mass
*01:26.200- 01:31.800* :  shooting in Prague killed himself as they closed in. The US as it's ready to support a UN
*01:31.800- 01:37.660* :  resolution on Gaza but calls for a ceasefire have been watered down and China announces new
*01:37.660- 01:46.840* :  restrictions for online video games. Also in the podcast, thousands of turtles in Peru are saved
*01:46.840- 01:53.440* :  from trafficking and what we use to see when people enter institution that is an accelerated
*01:53.440- 02:00.340* :  cognitive decline is not observed in this institution. The French village specially created for
*02:00.340- 02:09.940* :  dementia patients. The authorities in the Czech Republic have released more details about
*02:09.940- 02:15.600* :  yesterday's gun attack by a student at Charles University in Prague. The Czech interior minister
*02:15.600- 02:22.060* :  said the 24-year-old had killed 14 people at the university, students and staff, as well as himself,
*02:22.060- 02:28.820* :  making it the worst mass shooting in Europe since the Paris attacks of 2015. The gunman, identified
*02:28.820- 02:34.500* :  as David Kozak, had earlier killed his father at his home in a village outside the capital.
*02:34.500- 02:39.240* :  In a news conference today, police denied being slow to react to the shooting at the university,
*02:39.840- 02:43.440* :  saying they had arrived four minutes after getting the first reports of shots.
*02:43.440- 02:55.400* :  At the time, some of the police men there only had short guns and they were not sufficiently
*02:55.400- 03:05.700* :  protected. They used their guns and when they got to the balcony, it's yet unclear what exactly
*03:05.700- 03:13.800* :  happened. We think the perpetrator dropped the gun and thanks to this, thanks to the
*03:13.800- 03:20.480* :  intervention, the area was secured in the end he decided to commit suicide.
*03:21.280- 03:25.800* :  Police also said they were investigating whether the gunman was linked to the killing of a man
*03:25.800- 03:31.360* :  and his baby daughter in a forest on the outskirts of Prague a week ago. The Czech interior minister,
*03:31.360- 03:37.540* :  Vite Rakushan, was asked by the BBC if he had any idea of why the suspect might have carried out
*03:37.540- 03:45.680* :  the attacks. Some advises, some kind of inspiration from the drought and fascination of this type
*03:46.060- 03:52.900* :  of crimes, but we have also got a lot of disinformation. For example, some connection to Ukraine,
*03:52.900- 04:00.500* :  no connection to Ukraine and Ukrainians at all. It was the Czech man from the Czech family living
*04:00.500- 04:08.560* :  in Czech Republic for his whole life, so no connection with Ukraine. The second one is he reported
*04:08.560- 04:16.580* :  about described before, described in some Facebook or Instagram or some social media or something
*04:16.580- 04:24.380* :  like that, known without reports before the crime. So to speak about the motifs, now about the
*04:24.380- 04:31.320* :  motivation for this crime, it's really not easy, but from my point of view it's just the typical
*04:31.320- 04:40.160* :  picture of this style of trial or shooter in the whole earth, just some personal problems,
*04:41.100- 04:48.200* :  some kind of depression, some kind of disappointment from family, from his life, from everything,
*04:48.300- 04:56.740* :  but we don't have but they got proofs and information from himself why he decided to do something
*04:56.740- 05:02.160* :  so thorough. Check interior minister Vite Rakushan talking to the BBC,
*05:02.900- 05:06.960* :  are you're a regional editor Danny Aberhard watched the earlier police news conference
*05:06.960- 05:11.980* :  and told me more about what had been said. One of the key points was how quickly the police
*05:11.980- 05:18.240* :  responded apparently according to the police. They got to the scene in four minutes of the first
*05:18.240- 05:24.620* :  report of the shooting. There was this remarkable sequence of events yesterday, Oli, whereby police
*05:24.620- 05:31.100* :  knew that there was a potential gunman heading to Prague and they knew he was going to attend a
*05:31.840- 05:39.220* :  lecture at a university faculty there. They knew that his father had been found dead in the village
*05:39.220- 05:45.980* :  outside Prague and they proceeded to evacuate one building and within half an hour of having evacuated
*05:45.980- 05:51.020* :  that building, the shooting actually started in the same faculty but in a different building
*05:51.020- 05:58.360* :  close by so excruciatingly close to having actually perhaps stop the shooting altogether but not
*05:58.360- 06:03.100* :  quite. What we understand is that all the victims, all the people who died have been identified
*06:03.100- 06:09.420* :  but they haven't all been publicly named. Yeah although I did see that one was an academic at the
*06:09.420- 06:15.500* :  university. In that news conference we saw footage of the police going through the building
*06:15.500- 06:21.000* :  and it turns out that the gunman was on the roof at one point. Absolutely. The body cam footage that
*06:21.000- 06:25.840* :  the police showed. They showed it on a very small screen. It seems rather improvised on that
*06:26.500- 06:31.160* :  level but in some ways perhaps good because it was very chaotic. There was police arriving in
*06:31.160- 06:37.460* :  vehicles and then running through the halls of the faculty building with students around obviously
*06:37.460- 06:42.860* :  as well, lots of shouting and you've got a sense of the chaos of the whole situation. It was very
*06:42.860- 06:48.820* :  brief. The shooting lasted for about 20 minutes or so but devastating in that in what actually
*06:48.820- 06:53.580* :  happened. A number of people obviously injured as well. All the people who died were checked
*06:53.640- 07:00.520* :  but among the injured there are three foreigners, a Dutch person and a two from the United Arab
*07:00.520- 07:05.900* :  Emirates but we'll be learning more about the victims obviously in the hours and days ahead.
*07:05.900- 07:10.700* :  The families of the people who have died have been informed. And what is this other incident
*07:10.700- 07:16.380* :  that they're investigating which they say might be linked? That incident is a killing of a man and
*07:16.400- 07:23.180* :  he's two month old daughter in a forest on the other side of Prague to the village that the
*07:23.180- 07:29.600* :  gunman is set to come from. Accurus but they very firmly believe that the person who carried out
*07:29.600- 07:34.600* :  the shooting yesterday David Kosek was the same person who did the killings in the forest.
*07:35.100- 07:39.580* :  There's a big investigation into that. They're waiting for ballistics tests to be
*07:39.960- 07:45.500* :  100% certain but certainly at this stage all the indications are that he carried out those killings
*07:45.500- 07:52.180* :  as well. A Europe regional editor Danny Eberhardt. All week is more and more people have been dying
*07:52.180- 07:57.260* :  in Gaza. The United Nations Security Council has been debating whether to call for a
*07:57.260- 08:02.660* :  truce between Israel and Hamas. There was due to be a vote on Monday afternoon in New York but
*08:03.020- 08:07.700* :  Israel's ally the United States was unhappy with a draft resolution calling for an urgent
*08:07.700- 08:13.140* :  halt in the fighting. The latest version has been watered down speaking about creating conditions
*08:13.140- 08:20.380* :  for a cessation of hostilities rather than pushing for an actual pause. The US ambassador to the
*08:20.380- 08:27.020* :  UN Linda Thomas Greenfield is now happy with it. We have worked hard and diligently over the course
*08:27.100- 08:36.160* :  of the past week with the Emirates with others with Egypt to come up with a resolution that
*08:36.300- 08:44.100* :  we can support and we do have that resolution now. The draft resolution is a very strong resolution
*08:44.840- 08:52.580* :  that is fully supported by the Europe group that provides them what they feel is needed to get
*08:52.580- 08:58.440* :  humanitarian assistance on the ground. But other nations are said to have reservations about it
*08:58.820- 09:04.260* :  and having consultations on whether they can back it. Lucy Williamson has this report from Jerusalem.
*09:04.920- 09:09.720* :  If there was any hope that this UN resolution could help ease the situation for Gaza's civilians,
*09:09.720- 09:16.640* :  it's fast draining away. The language agreed by the Americans is vega on both an end to the hostilities
*09:17.260- 09:23.380* :  and the delivery of aid. Separate talks in Egypt, designed to secure a fresh truce between
*09:23.380- 09:29.980* :  Israel and Hamas, have also so far failed to deliver results. Israel has said it's open to a
*09:29.980- 09:36.280* :  temporary pause in fighting to get more hostages out, but that the war would continue until Hamas
*09:36.280- 09:42.660* :  was destroyed. Yesterday, Hamas reiterated its refusal to release any captives without a
*09:42.660- 09:49.060* :  full and permanent end to the war. Gaza's health ministry says almost 400 people have been killed
*09:49.060- 09:54.240* :  there over the past two days and aid organisations have warned that people are facing starvation.
*09:54.700- 09:59.520* :  Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem. It sounds like the kind of government intervention that many
*09:59.520- 10:05.800* :  parents might like, a restriction on online gaming, limiting in-game spending and cutting down
*10:05.800- 10:11.480* :  on incentives that keep people playing for hours. But the moves by regulators in China have not
*10:11.480- 10:16.280* :  gone down well with the markets. Chairs in the biggest online gaming firm Tencent
*10:16.280- 10:23.120* :  fell 12 percent while its closest rival net ease dropped by 25 percent. Since he came to power in
*10:23.120- 10:28.420* :  China, President Xi Jinping has moved to reassert communist party control over different parts of
*10:28.420- 10:34.040* :  the economy. Our Asia business correspondent Monica Miller told us more. Beijing officials are
*10:34.040- 10:38.940* :  trying to rein in what they see as a growing problem of a gaming addiction, particularly among
*10:38.940- 10:44.560* :  young people. Now, these new rules were required online games to set spending limits also in-game
*10:44.560- 10:49.820* :  measures that would incentivize high spending such as daily login rewards. Well, those will be
*10:49.820- 10:55.820* :  banned. And also part of the software that we'll need to add pop-ups that warn people of what they
*10:55.820- 11:01.940* :  call a rational playing behavior in order to make them aware of just how long they have been online.
*11:02.400- 11:07.040* :  Is this just about protecting gamers from harm of playing too much?
*11:08.180- 11:13.780* :  Well, China has kind of really cracked down at a couple of industry, but particularly the tech
*11:13.780- 11:19.880* :  industry, which they saw as getting too hot and too big, almost out of their regulation control.
*11:21.160- 11:26.280* :  So Alibaba is one example where they had some regulations, but the gaming industry, particularly
*11:26.280- 11:32.840* :  when we look at companies like Tencent, these are wildly popular all over the world. So one way to
*11:32.840- 11:38.620* :  do that is by limiting the amount of licenses that are granted to these companies. And that is
*11:38.620- 11:43.660* :  one of the big concerns that we are now seeing on the market today, this reaction of their shares
*11:43.660- 11:48.560* :  just plummeting. Now, this isn't the first time Beijing has done something like this. Back in 2021,
*11:49.280- 11:54.340* :  if you can recall, people were stuck at home and kids were playing online a lot. Well,
*11:54.520- 11:58.720* :  the government cracked down on that on put a cap on the amount of time that children could spend
*11:58.720- 12:06.120* :  playing online. This industry is worth about $47 billion. And it's the world's largest. So when
*12:06.120- 12:12.920* :  it stopped publishing licenses like this, it really hit their bottom line. And so back in April,
*12:12.920- 12:18.320* :  Beijing put an end to a nine month freeze on these gaming licenses. And it started to raise hopes that
*12:18.320- 12:23.100* :  these companies would start making the money that they want saw again. But this is now put a damper
*12:23.260- 12:29.940* :  on that growth. Yeah, might this damage the Chinese economy or is there hopes that eventually
*12:29.940- 12:35.760* :  these companies will bounce back? It's a really good question because China's economy has been
*12:35.760- 12:40.160* :  softening as we have seen. And part of that has to do with those strict COVID lockdowns that they
*12:40.160- 12:45.380* :  had for three years. Also, their export market is rather soft. And that's just due to the global
*12:45.380- 12:51.760* :  economy. But also, their real estate market has really taken a hit. So you would think that, you know,
*12:51.760- 12:57.220* :  maybe they would they would boost up other industries like big tech. But I think they see this as
*12:57.520- 13:02.320* :  a real concern, particularly among its young people. And it's not the direction that Xi Jinping
*13:02.320- 13:06.600* :  sees his country going, which is really back to those traditional communist roots.
*13:06.980- 13:11.880* :  I as your business correspondent Monica Miller, staying with technology, do you remember these sounds
*13:11.900- 13:14.800* :  from the late 1990s and early 2000s?
*13:22.460- 13:27.280* :  Well, those are the classic ringtones we used to have before smartphones took off in the late
*13:27.280- 13:33.720* :  naughties. But what effect has the move away from basic phones had on our psychological well-being?
*13:33.720- 13:38.600* :  Studies have shown a potential connection between endless scrolling and sleep deprivation,
*13:38.600- 13:43.060* :  depression, anxiety, and even the development of attention deficit symptoms.
*13:43.780- 13:50.080* :  Anna Bangsgood, Matiasen, is a convert to the dumb phone movement, which advocates using a
*13:50.080- 13:55.720* :  handset that only has telephone and text functions. He works with young people in Denmark. James
*13:55.720- 13:59.440* :  Copnell asked him what prompted him to begin to live without a smartphone.
*14:00.460- 14:05.640* :  I had a period in my life where I suffered a lot of from anxiety. And I tried a lot of different
*14:05.640- 14:11.200* :  things to deal with it. And then by accident, at some point my smartphone broke. And then I had to
*14:11.200- 14:16.720* :  find that I had a temporary solution for the week when it was being repaired. And that temporary
*14:16.720- 14:21.620* :  solution turned out to be an old Nokia that I had in a drawer. And I started using that.
*14:22.060- 14:27.080* :  And then I didn't expect anything specific to happen from it. But it ended up being,
*14:28.120- 14:33.300* :  like I noticed that it lowered my anxiety level. And especially in social situations,
*14:33.340- 14:40.120* :  I noticed that suddenly I was forced to deal with these small awkward moments or small,
*14:40.120- 14:46.960* :  like anxious moments. And that over time made it easier and easier to deal with them and had a
*14:46.960- 14:51.680* :  positive effect on my anxiety level. And that's why I chose to continue with using a dumb phone.
*14:52.440- 14:57.980* :  And I have a tablet on the side. So I'm not going completely back to the old age.
*14:58.680- 15:04.220* :  So I have found a good way of having both things. So I can get those breaks. And then I can also
*15:04.600- 15:09.620* :  use those important apps on my tablets. You go into schools and talk to students about it.
*15:10.020- 15:14.340* :  How do they react when you say, turn back the technology guys?
*15:14.860- 15:20.540* :  I'm much more fond of giving them an experience themselves. So I'm making experiments on schools
*15:21.100- 15:26.160* :  where I'm doing everything that I can to convince as many of them as possible to
*15:26.740- 15:33.780* :  switch from the smartphone to a dumb phone for a period of 10 days. And then I have 600 phones right
*15:33.780- 15:39.100* :  now of a of dumb phones. And I'm using them. So I have enough to cover all of the students.
*15:39.660- 15:44.700* :  And that's the core principle of it that makes it fun. That is that they are all doing it at the
*15:44.700- 15:49.860* :  same time. That also the typical thing that people are afraid of is that they're afraid of
*15:50.340- 15:56.420* :  experiencing FOMO and it eliminates FOMO because everybody is missing out. It's very similar
*15:56.640- 16:00.860* :  the things that the students are explaining. One of the things core things that is repeating
*16:00.860- 16:06.420* :  themselves is they're explaining that they're sleeping better. It's easier for them to fall to
*16:06.420- 16:13.000* :  sleep and they're they have a more deep sleep. And is the major benefit here for people's mental health?
*16:13.060- 16:18.520* :  The sleep is a thing that the students are mentioning. But it's also the anxiety level is
*16:18.520- 16:23.860* :  something that I repeatedly hear. I think it was somewhere around five or six days into the
*16:23.860- 16:28.860* :  experiment. There was one of the students who was standing up and explaining that she actually
*16:28.860- 16:35.560* :  felt less anxious after switching. And then another 50 students stood up and there was 95
*16:35.560- 16:40.560* :  students in this experiment. So that was over half of all of the students who were experiencing
*16:40.620- 16:47.760* :  less anxiety. All of the things that most people seems to have as intuitive thinking of how
*16:47.760- 16:53.100* :  smart ones might or social media might have affected society. That could be making us
*16:54.000- 17:01.060* :  less open when we are in public or less social when we're with friends. These are the exact
*17:01.060- 17:05.740* :  things that I hear the students explaining that they're actually experiencing the opposite of
*17:05.740- 17:10.340* :  that they're experiencing being more present in conversations, experiencing having an easier time
*17:10.340- 17:16.180* :  of making their homework or having an easier time of falling into those random conversations in
*17:16.180- 17:21.420* :  the dining hall. Oh no, thanks God. Mathias and on the advantages of going back to basics by
*17:21.420- 17:37.780* :  not owning a smartphone. Still to come on the global news podcast? The world's biggest lottery

*19:01.320- 19:07.720* :  a successful Christmas song? And why did the old tunes do the best? The global story brings you

*19:22.420- 19:27.600* :  Officials in Peru say they've foiled a plot to smuggle thousands of baby turtles to Indonesia,
*19:27.660- 19:33.400* :  just the latest incident in the multi-billion dollar trade in protected species. Peter Goffin has
*19:38.380- 19:42.900* :  this report. In Lima, a spokesman for Peru's National Forestry and Wildlife Service holds up
*19:42.900- 19:51.860* :  two turtles, small enough to fit in the palm of his hand. This is a terracaya, he says,
*19:52.480- 19:58.780* :  this species has one beard under the beak. And here on the Aru Turtle, they were two. That's one
*19:58.780- 20:04.660* :  of the characteristics that help make an easy distinction, he says. These turtles are babies
*20:04.860- 20:09.240* :  right now, but they'll grow into some of the largest river turtles in South America.
*20:10.140- 20:16.900* :  And this pair were among 4,000 turtles seized at Jorge Chavez Airport as authorities say,
*20:16.940- 20:23.740* :  smugglers tried to ship them to Indonesia using false customs papers. The terracaya is listed
*20:23.740- 20:29.760* :  as a vulnerable species. And, like the Aru, its export is regulated by the convention on
*20:29.760- 20:35.520* :  international trade in endangered species. Interpol says the black market for wildlife
*20:35.520- 20:42.120* :  products is worth up to 20 billion dollars a year, and conservationists say thousands of turtles
*20:42.120- 20:47.780* :  are smuggled primarily to East Asia to be eaten, used in traditional medicines, or have their
*20:47.780- 20:54.040* :  shells turned into jewelry. It's a business that attracts both big and small time operators.
*20:54.840- 21:01.520* :  In 2015, a Canadian university student was arrested at the US border, with more than 50 live turtles
*21:01.520- 21:08.540* :  hidden in his trousers. Police say he'd plan to ship them to China. The turtles seized in Peru
*21:08.540- 21:13.740* :  have now been sent to an authorized breeding facility, where officials say they'll be kept
*21:14.060- 21:20.480* :  until a more permanent home is found. These turtles, at least, are safe. Peter Goffin
*21:21.300- 21:26.600* :  Researchers at a pioneering village for dementia patients in France say early results suggest
*21:26.600- 21:32.460* :  residents are happier and healthier than elsewhere. Village was set up in 2020 to provide
*21:32.460- 21:38.640* :  supported living and care and replicates aspects of real village life. Initial findings suggest
*21:38.640- 21:43.640* :  residents avoid the steep decline in their condition that's often seen in the first 12 months
*21:43.640- 21:49.060* :  after a person enters a care home. Our health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson has been to visit
*21:49.060- 21:58.780* :  the village Launday. This is a village with a difference. Here all the villagers have dementia.
*22:00.380- 22:05.840* :  The shop in the main square supplies simple groceries, like the all-important baguette,
*22:06.240- 22:10.840* :  and to reduce stress, it doesn't take money, so no one has to remember that wallet.
*22:13.420- 22:19.340* :  Next door is the restaurant and the social heart of the village, where I meet Francis,
*22:19.720- 22:24.480* :  a former farmer. What was it like when the doctor said you had Alzheimer's?
*22:28.540- 22:36.180* :  He tells me that his father also had Alzheimer's, but he says he's not afraid of dying because
*22:36.180- 22:41.660* :  that will happen one day. Meanwhile, I will live my life despite the disease. I'm here to live
*22:41.660- 22:50.080* :  even though it's not the same. And for one couple dementia has reunited them. Philippe came first
*22:50.260- 22:56.900* :  and then Vivienne. It is of course bittersweet, but here they live as normal a life as they're able.
*22:57.420- 23:05.220* :  What do you do here? We go on walks. We walk. I get the feeling you're very happy.
*23:05.220- 23:15.180* :  Are we? Yes. We feel good here, truly. They say time passes differently here. There are no set
*23:15.180- 23:22.320* :  hours for appointments, shopping or washing imposed on residents. There's just a gentle rhythm,
*23:22.900- 23:29.680* :  a coaxing and a cajoling, with the aim of giving these villagers as much freedom as possible.
*23:30.660- 23:37.220* :  This dementia village is being closely monitored. Professor Ellen Amieva says early results suggest
*23:37.220- 23:42.340* :  it's specially adapted environment is actually influencing the course of the disease.
*23:42.700- 23:48.480* :  What we use to see when people enter institution that is an accelerated cognitive decline
*23:48.480- 23:53.520* :  is not observed in this institution. So this could be a question about can you actually extend
*23:53.520- 24:00.920* :  people's lives? Yeah, yeah, that's an important question, but can we extend people's life in good
*24:00.920- 24:10.580* :  conditions? And researchers say there's also a drastic reduction in families' feelings of guilt,
*24:10.580- 24:18.040* :  such as for Dominique whose 89-year-old mother is at the village. I have peace of mind because I
*24:18.040- 24:23.700* :  know she has peace of mind and is safe. When I leave her, I am relieved. When I arrive, it's like
*24:23.700- 24:33.080* :  I'm just at her house. I'm at home with my mom. In the village, hairdressers, 65-year-old Patricia has
*24:33.080- 24:38.240* :  just finished having her hair blow dried. She says the village has given her her life back.
*24:38.380- 24:45.700* :  I was at home, but I was getting bored. I had the lady to cook for me. I was tired, I was not feeling
*24:45.700- 24:52.080* :  well. I knew that as I was, I wasn't easy and I was scared. I wanted to be somewhere where I
*24:52.080- 24:57.980* :  could help to because in other institutions, it's like this, like that, but they don't do anything
*24:57.980- 25:02.840* :  whereas here, it's real life. When I say real, I mean real.
*25:02.840- 25:13.220* :  Back in the restaurant, villages and staff sit at a long table, laughing and chatting while making
*25:13.220- 25:20.640* :  Christmas decorations. So often dementia can isolate people, but here there seems to be a strong
*25:20.640- 25:26.760* :  sense of community with people genuinely interested to see each other and take part in activities,
*25:26.760- 25:33.640* :  and researchers think that it's this social element that may be part of the key to living a
*25:33.660- 25:40.500* :  happier, potentially healthier life, with dementia. Sophie Hutchinson reporting from France.
*25:41.540- 25:46.540* :  Christmas has come early, four thousands of lucky winners in Spain's famous lottery,
*25:46.540- 25:51.460* :  El Gordo, or the fat one. It's the world's biggest lottery with more than two and a half billion
*25:51.460- 25:56.720* :  euros of prize money. The winning numbers are sung by children from a former home for orphans,
*25:56.720- 26:12.260* :  here they are revealing the top prize. It's thought that more than three quarters of the
*26:12.260- 26:17.780* :  population watch the televised draw live, so what makes it such a huge event for Spain?
*26:17.780- 26:23.120* :  We asked our correspondent in Madrid, Guy Hegeco. This is 200 or so years old,
*26:23.400- 26:28.520* :  the Christmas lottery in Spain, and it's very much a Christmas tradition, as much as
*26:29.020- 26:35.520* :  Christmas carols or Christmas trees, and millions of Spaniards huddled around their TV sets or
*26:35.520- 26:41.480* :  their radios, listening to those numbers being called out by those children in the Royal Opera House
*26:42.020- 26:46.960* :  to see if they have won something, and what people often do when they take part in the lottery is,
*26:47.480- 26:52.460* :  they don't just buy a ticket on their own, they get together with friends or family or
*26:52.460- 26:58.380* :  colleagues from work, and they buy lots of tickets together, with the idea being that they will
*26:58.380- 27:06.000* :  share out the winnings if they should win anything. Obviously there's a lot of expectation because
*27:06.000- 27:11.420* :  people hope to win, but it's just taking part in it and the whole of the ceremony of it,
*27:11.720- 27:16.940* :  which we're watching now, that's all part of the Christmas tradition, Christmas in Spain.
*27:17.500- 27:23.960* :  Now the top prize isn't huge compared to other lotteries around the world. Why then is there so
*27:23.960- 27:31.320* :  much excitement? Well, I think because it's been around so long, people buy tickets, if you buy
*27:31.320- 27:37.240* :  a single ticket, that will cost you 20 euros, but they come in strips of 10, so that would cost
*27:37.300- 27:45.000* :  you 200 euros. If one of those strips wins, then you can win up to 4 million euros for the full
*27:45.000- 27:51.200* :  strip, so what people often do is they're buying lots of these strips together, so the individual
*27:51.200- 27:58.600* :  prizes are not, perhaps as you say, as big as in other countries, but often what you see is people
*27:58.600- 28:04.200* :  from a village or a town somewhere might buy them together, and they end up winning a huge amount
*28:04.200- 28:11.460* :  because they've bought lots of the same number together, and they can be winning your millions of
*28:11.460- 28:20.360* :  euros in one go, so I think that the prospect of that gets people very excited, and so many people
*28:20.360- 28:27.040* :  take part in this, I mean millions of people buy tickets, they queue up to buy tickets from a particular
*28:27.540- 28:33.380* :  seller weeks ahead of the draw, so all of that, all of the atmosphere building up to it does get
*28:33.380- 28:39.300* :  people very excited. Guy, Hedgeko in Madrid, and from the Spanish lottery, we move to another
*28:39.300- 28:45.620* :  Christmas tradition that can be traced back 200 years, because it's been two centuries since the poem,
*28:45.620- 28:51.380* :  a visit from St. Nicholas, was first published. It's remained a Christmas favourite ever since.
*28:51.380- 28:56.700* :  Originally published anonymously and later attributed to the American writer Clement Clarke Moore,
*28:56.700- 29:02.360* :  it's more commonly known as, towards the night before Christmas. The poet and children's author,
*29:02.360- 29:07.600* :  Joseph Coilo, looks at the poems enduring popularity, and why many still read it to their children
*29:07.600- 29:14.180* :  on Christmas Eve. It was the night before Christmas, when all through the house,
*29:15.200- 29:22.020* :  not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
*29:23.360- 29:26.700* :  in hopes that St. Nicholas would soon be there.
*29:28.960- 29:36.680* :  This poem is really the epitome of Christmas. We've got all the reindeer mentioned by name,
*29:36.680- 29:42.460* :  it's where we get with the names of the reindeer, it kind of sets up for us some of the well held
*29:42.460- 29:49.320* :  traditions of Christmas. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugarplums
*29:49.320- 29:56.380* :  danced in their heads. A mammar in her kerchief and eye in my cap had just settled her brains for a
*29:56.380- 30:02.380* :  long winter's nap. I think that the sing-songy nature of it, there's something about it having that
*30:02.380- 30:09.200* :  regular rhyme scheme, so we've got these rhyming couplets throughout, which you know are
*30:09.200- 30:17.640* :  beloved of adults and children alike. So it's got a very familiar engaging rhyme scheme that draws
*30:17.640- 30:23.360* :  you in. The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below.
*30:24.560- 30:30.940* :  When what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.
*30:31.820- 30:38.680* :  Poems that deal with a day or a season or a time, you revisit and you go back to those traditions,
*30:39.360- 30:44.220* :  and the fact that this poem is about, you know, it's in the voice of the father of the family,
*30:44.940- 30:51.400* :  talking about, you know, Saint Nick, about Santa arriving, it sets up that family tradition within
*30:51.400- 30:57.620* :  the poem itself. So it becomes a natural piece to read again year after year when we're, you know,
*30:57.620- 31:04.140* :  starting to wrap up both ourselves and presents for Christmas. With a little old driver, so lively
*31:04.140- 31:11.360* :  and quick, I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick. More rapid than eagles, his courses they came,
*31:11.360- 31:17.860* :  and he whistled and shouted and called them by name. Now, Dasha, now, dance it now,
*31:17.860- 31:25.320* :  prancer and vixen, on, comet, on, cupid, on, on, Donna and Blitzen. Poetry really comes to life
*31:25.320- 31:30.760* :  when you read it out loud. And I think we often think that, you know, reading stories or poems
*31:30.760- 31:36.680* :  out loud is really something only done for children, but really it can be enjoyed by all ages. So
*31:36.680- 31:43.100* :  I think it should be forgotten that we can all benefit from both reading aloud, but also hearing,
*31:43.100- 31:47.740* :  hearing poems and stories read out loud. And if anyone listening hasn't done that for a while,
*31:47.740- 31:53.020* :  I would highly recommend that you get your family and friends around, be they adult or children,
*31:53.020- 31:58.100* :  and read them something out loud. He spranged with sleigh to his team, gave a whistle,
*31:58.960- 32:02.640* :  and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim,
*32:03.420- 32:09.040* :  he drove out of sight, happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
*32:12.240- 32:16.400* :  Can't argue with that, some of the many different recordings of a visit from Saint Nicholas
*32:16.400- 32:20.420* :  over the decades with the thoughts from the poet Joseph Coilow.
*32:23.620- 32:27.500* :  And that's all from us for now, but the Global News podcast will be back very soon. This
*32:27.500- 32:31.540* :  edition was mixed by Chesney Forks, Porter and Produced by Chantal Hartle. Our editors,
*32:31.540- 32:34.680* :  Karen Martin, I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
