*01:12.000- 01:16.800* :  I'm Chris Barrow and at 14 GMT on the 1st of December, these are our main stories.
*01:17.480- 01:21.560* :  Israel attacks Hamas as the ceasefire agreement in Gaza comes to an end.
*01:22.040- 01:25.360* :  Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli prisons save a suffered abuse
*01:25.360- 01:27.360* :  after the October 7th attacks.

*01:51.840- 01:52.580* :  We'll find out.
*01:57.580- 02:00.940* :  Israel has resumed its combat operations against Hamas,
*02:00.940- 02:06.100* :  ending a seven-day temporary pause in fighting that saw the release of 110 hostages
*02:06.100- 02:10.120* :  held by Hamas and 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
*02:10.820- 02:13.460* :  Explosions and gunfire have been reported in Gaza.
*02:13.940- 02:18.480* :  One source told the BBC that Hamas believes Israel broke the truth by not allowing fuel
*02:18.480- 02:20.340* :  into the north of the Gaza Strip.
*02:20.820- 02:24.560* :  James Elder from the UN Children's Agency, UNICEF, is in southern Gaza.
*02:43.340- 02:46.500* :  With the wounds of war recovering from the last attack,
*02:46.500- 02:49.380* :  this is the nightmare that everyone utterly feared.
*02:49.780- 02:53.240* :  Our correspondent, Inter-Islam Huga Bashayga, gave us this update.
*02:53.800- 02:59.100* :  The Israeli military has confirmed that it has resumed its offensive against Hamas and Gaza.
*02:59.100- 03:06.980* :  There have been Israeli airstrikes targeting a number of positions across the Gaza Strip.
*03:07.540- 03:13.920* :  And we had a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office saying that
*03:14.800- 03:23.680* :  Hamas had breached the terms of the ceasefire by launching rockets against Israel
*03:24.380- 03:28.740* :  and by not releasing all women who are being held captive in Gaza.
*03:28.940- 03:34.740* :  And the release of those hostages was a key element of this ceasefire deal.
*03:34.920- 03:41.020* :  We understand that talks continue right now, mediators from Egypt, from Qatar,
*03:41.020- 03:44.640* :  are still trying to reach a deal between Israel and Hamas.
*03:44.640- 03:47.380* :  But fighting right now has resumed in Gaza.
*03:47.840- 03:50.960* :  And those talks, they're over other hostages presumably,
*03:50.960- 03:56.760* :  but I think the remaining hostages are more men rather than women and younger boys.
*03:57.480- 04:02.340* :  Exactly. So we've seen that more than 100 people have been freed so far,
*04:02.340- 04:09.000* :  women and children. And in return, Palestinian women and teenagers have been released from Israeli
*04:09.000- 04:18.340* :  jails. 140 people remain in captivity in Gaza. And most of them are men and Israeli military
*04:18.340- 04:26.000* :  personnel. Now, our understanding is that Hamas is against the idea of keeping the same
*04:26.000- 04:34.020* :  terms of the initial deal to release those men from captivity. So it could be that Hamas is
*04:34.020- 04:39.060* :  making some demands in terms of the Palestinian prisoners being released. And it seems that this
*04:39.060- 04:43.040* :  is one of the main obstacles in these negotiations that continue.
*04:43.500- 04:48.140* :  Are there positive signs that that may yield results because at the moment it doesn't seem like
*04:48.140- 04:51.400* :  it's that likely given that the fighting has already resumed?
*04:52.460- 04:59.400* :  Yeah, we know that there is a massive international effort happening right now to extend this deal,
*04:59.400- 05:04.680* :  not only to allow the release of those hostages, American officials who have been
*05:04.680- 05:10.980* :  having involved in these negotiations have been saying that the goal is to keep
*05:10.980- 05:15.580* :  extending this pausing hostilities to allow everybody to be released.
*05:16.960- 05:23.220* :  And also, I think there is a lot of pressure from the UN from aid agencies for the cease
*05:23.220- 05:29.020* :  fire to be extended or for a deal to be reached. So more aid can get into Gaza. I mean, much needed
*05:29.020- 05:36.100* :  aid into Gaza. The humanitarian crisis continues. And I think obviously the news today that
*05:37.300- 05:42.640* :  the cease fire has expired and that fighting has resumed is obviously very concerning for
*05:42.640- 05:47.640* :  the people in Gaza. Hugo Bashayga, meanwhile, some of the released Palestinian prisoners say
*05:47.640- 05:52.640* :  Israeli guards abused them in the weeks after the 7th of October attack. The claims have been
*05:52.640- 05:57.420* :  denied by Israel's prison service, which says that all detainees are held in accordance with the
*05:57.420- 06:03.460* :  law. Ahmed Least correspondent Lucy Williamson has visited one prisoner, 18-year-old Mohammed Nazal,
*06:03.680- 06:08.520* :  who spent three months in jail without charge and arrived home in the occupied West Bank in the
*06:08.520- 06:14.260* :  early hours of Tuesday morning. We're driving through the occupied West Bank on our way to the northern
*06:14.260- 06:21.160* :  city of Janine. We're on our way to visit a Palestinian teenager, Mohammed Nazal, who was released
*06:21.160- 06:28.800* :  from Israeli jail. Mohammed says after the Hamas attacks on the 7th of October, the behavior of
*06:28.800- 06:36.760* :  Israeli prison guards changed. The dog attacking me wore a muzzle with very sharp edges.
*06:37.600- 06:42.440* :  His muzzle and clothes left marks all over my body. Then they started beating us.
*06:43.220- 06:48.520* :  They took our mattresses, our clothes, our pillows, and they threw our food on the floor.
*06:49.420- 06:54.820* :  People were terrified. I felt humiliated and insulted. The fact that they attacked us with
*06:54.820- 06:59.440* :  their dogs, sticks and arms when we are unarmed and not able to defend ourselves.
*07:00.520- 07:06.240* :  Mohammed's hands are heavily bandaged. His family show us x-rays and a medical report from
*07:06.240- 07:12.020* :  a hospital in Ramallah on the day of his release. Both documents say his hands are fractured
*07:12.480- 07:18.840* :  from a beating by prison guards. Mohammed says they arranged us so that the elderly prisoners were
*07:18.860- 07:24.140* :  put in the back and the young in the front. They took me and started beating me. I was trying to protect
*07:24.140- 07:28.040* :  my head and they were trying to break my legs in my hands.
*07:30.420- 07:36.060* :  Israel's prison service says Mohammed's story is false and that a medical examination before
*07:36.060- 07:43.080* :  leaving prison found no problems. It published a video of the teenager boarding a Red Cross
*07:43.080- 07:51.400* :  bus after his release with his hands unbandaged. Mohammed says his wounds were first treated on
*07:51.400- 07:58.200* :  that Red Cross bus. Photographs of him reuniting with family on arrival in Ramallah show his hands
*07:58.200- 08:08.680* :  in bandages. Another prisoner released this week, Lama Carter, alleged in a video on social media
*08:08.680- 08:14.780* :  that an Israeli officer had threatened her with rape shortly after her arrest in late October.
*08:15.220- 08:21.720* :  He was handcuffed and blindfolded. They threatened to rape me.
*08:22.660- 08:24.680* :  It's clear the goal was to intimidate me.
*08:26.300- 08:33.300* :  Israel says she has denied the incident and that it's filed a complaint for incitement with her lawyer.
*08:34.680- 08:40.880* :  But Lama Carter told us that women prisoners, including herself, had indeed been threatened with
*08:40.880- 08:46.780* :  rape. The head of the Palestinian Prisoners Society Abdullah Azagari said he've heard
*08:46.780- 08:51.280* :  testimony that suggested guards had urinated on handcuffs prisoners.
*08:53.000- 08:58.680* :  Israel's prison service said it was not aware of the claims that all prisoners were lawfully
*08:58.680- 09:04.740* :  detained, had all the basic rights required under law and could file an official complaint.
*09:05.460- 09:10.660* :  In Kabatia, Mohammed's brother Mutaz told me something had broken in the teenager.
*09:13.020- 09:20.920* :  This is not the Muhammad Wino. He was much stronger back then. It's as if his heart is filled with terror.
*09:21.640- 09:28.120* :  Muhammad was released in exchange for Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas, one of the group's key
*09:28.120- 09:35.280* :  goals in carrying out the attacks. Those attacks, Muhammad says, not only changed the lives of the
*09:35.280- 09:43.240* :  Palestinian prisoners released, but those in Israeli jails. Lucy Williamson. A world leaders
*09:43.240- 09:49.060* :  are meeting in Dubai for the UN Climate Change Summit, COP28. The United Nations Secretary-General
*09:49.060- 09:54.160* :  Antony Guterres described global warming as a sickness bringing our climate to its knees.
*09:54.840- 09:57.620* :  King Charles III also made his address to global leaders.
*09:58.240- 10:06.580* :  I pray with all my heart that COP28 will be another critical turning point towards genuine
*10:06.580- 10:13.960* :  transformational action at a time when already as scientists have been warning for so long,
*10:14.580- 10:22.220* :  we are seeing alarming tipping points being reached. I've spent a large proportion of my life
*10:22.220- 10:29.080* :  trying to warn of the existential threats facing us over global warming, over climate change
*10:29.080- 10:34.840* :  and biodiversity loss. I spoke to the BBC's environment correspondent Matt McGraw, who's in Dubai,
*10:34.840- 10:40.900* :  asking him what COP28 might achieve. The leaders will be here for today and tomorrow and they
*10:40.900- 10:46.380* :  will probably agree on a number of measures on climate change, such as the perhaps the tripling
*10:46.380- 10:53.020* :  of renewable energy and the doubling of energy efficiency by 2030, as well as probably putting in
*10:53.020- 10:59.260* :  large amounts of money into various climate funds. King Charles's speech in the hall was at the
*10:59.260- 11:04.360* :  very start of the leader's segment and they went down very well. I think with the audience there,
*11:04.360- 11:08.720* :  obviously he kind of preached the converted, but he has a track record of speaking at these
*11:08.720- 11:12.920* :  major events. He spoke before the Paris Agreement, and he mentioned it in the speech that he had
*11:13.060- 11:16.960* :  given the opening address there, and that had turned to great success. He's hoping it can actually
*11:16.960- 11:22.100* :  be repeated here as well. He painted a very stark picture of the impact of climate change on the
*11:22.100- 11:27.880* :  world, saying that we're carrying out this vast frightening experiment of changing all ecology and
*11:27.880- 11:34.040* :  all nature all at once, and that our children, our grandchildren, wouldn't be judges by our words
*11:34.040- 11:39.600* :  in 2050. They're judges by what we're doing now. So it was a very clear message, a very strong
*11:39.600- 11:44.680* :  message, and I think it really summed up the sense of some hope that things can be different,
*11:44.680- 11:49.080* :  but also that the scale of climate change at the world is facing is particularly frightening.
*11:49.680- 11:54.360* :  You mentioned some of the funds and some of the money. We know that the UAE president has announced
*11:54.360- 12:00.380* :  $30 billion worth of funding for global climate solutions, he said. These kind of funds,
*12:00.380- 12:06.000* :  I guess they are very useful if that money does actually go on to properly tackle climate change.
*12:06.880- 12:10.760* :  Yeah, we don't really have very many details of what that fund will be and how it will work,
*12:10.760- 12:16.380* :  but it's certainly in terms of the scale is probably something way bigger than people have heard of
*12:16.380- 12:21.320* :  before in relation to finance. I understand it's going to work as an investment fund and that
*12:21.320- 12:28.900* :  it hopes to attract other investments, totaling to about 250 billion by 2030. Now certainly is
*12:29.180- 12:33.980* :  the type of money that developing nations say they need to cope with both the impacts of climate
*12:33.980- 12:38.940* :  change and to help them to adapt and move away from fossil fuels. So I think it will be seen
*12:38.940- 12:45.460* :  as in the right ballpark in terms of number, but how it's delivered, whether it's money that's
*12:45.460- 12:50.120* :  given in the form of loans or whether it's given in form of grants, that's a big, big issue.
*12:50.620- 12:54.740* :  A smaller developing country say that we want help but we don't want to be just burdening ourselves
*12:54.740- 12:59.300* :  with extra loans to cope with the impacts of climate change, a problem we didn't start.
*12:59.980- 13:04.740* :  Our environment correspondent Matt McGraw from Dubai, we've been talking a lot about climate
*13:04.740- 13:09.380* :  change on the global news podcast partly because of the COP28 climate conference. Now these
*13:09.380- 13:14.920* :  discussions usually focus on the dangers faced by humans, but animals and wildlife are equally
*13:14.920- 13:20.260* :  affected. Experts say that rising global temperatures are threatening thousands of species.
*13:21.020- 13:26.300* :  Well, when Gladys Kalema Zikosoka began working in Uganda's Windy National Park about 25 years
*13:26.300- 13:31.500* :  ago, the number of mountain gorillas was falling fast, but under her care, the population has
*13:31.500- 13:36.240* :  increased by two-thirds. She spoke to the BBC about her daily routine in the park.
*13:39.000- 13:44.500* :  Climate change is one of the major threats to gorillas. As this becomes a scarcity of water,
*13:44.500- 13:50.560* :  they strut, the gorillas are going to struggle. The climate has warmed up a few more degrees
*13:51.080- 13:54.860* :  and a lot of people get in my area because they weren't exposed to it before and they're really
*13:54.860- 14:02.000* :  getting sick. All these increasing infectious diseases eventually just peel over to the mountain
*14:02.000- 14:10.940* :  gorillas because they're always interacting with the communities. We are preventing the
*14:10.940- 14:15.680* :  notic disease between people and wildlife and we work closely with village health teams
*14:15.680- 14:21.280* :  or community health workers who we train to do conservation work. We make sure that they visit
*14:21.280- 14:26.520* :  people's homes regularly. Each of them is in charge of about 30 to 40 homes and they promote
*14:26.520- 14:37.760* :  good hygiene and sanitation, especially hand washing. Society doesn't encourage women to go out there
*14:37.760- 14:45.600* :  and do daring and dangerous things. Being out in the bush would limited amenities. They're
*14:45.600- 14:51.200* :  front-up on women who do things like that. So trying to break those barriers and say I'm going
*14:51.200- 14:56.780* :  out to do it because I really want to do it. I've found that they haven't been that many role models
*14:57.320- 15:02.100* :  but I'm glad that the role models are increasing over time. There's many more women now engaged
*15:02.100- 15:08.180* :  in conservation although we still have a long way to go. We need to regularly monitor the gorillas
*15:08.180- 15:15.740* :  hope and collect any people samples from the nightmares of the gorillas. Every night the gorillas
*15:15.740- 15:21.860* :  build a bed, a nest, a comfortable bed where they can sleep and in the morning as they're getting
*15:21.860- 15:29.000* :  up they're defecating it. So from here we have a nest of a mother and a baby, two super bucks
*15:29.840- 15:39.440* :  and one blood fuck. Every month we collect ficko samples from all the habituated gorilla groups
*15:39.480- 15:45.100* :  currently they're 26 to look for parasites, bacteria or viruses like they could be picking
*15:47.120- 15:53.360* :  from people or livestock and also when they have normal we carry out a lot of clinical science
*16:03.860- 16:09.040* :  observation. The climate crisis has made many people to feel hopeless, sometimes I feel hopeless
*16:10.440- 16:15.240* :  but one thing that makes me hopeful is that there's something that can be done about it.
*16:17.260- 16:20.980* :  Waking with gorillas gives me a lot of hope. It really does.
*16:24.240- 16:29.500* :  Doctor Kaleima Zikusoka who's on this year's list of BBC 100 women recognizing influential
*16:29.500- 16:33.200* :  women around the world and you can find the list on the BBC News website.
*16:36.220- 16:42.080* :  Well still to come but how did it happen? How did it get there if the author didn't write it and
*16:42.080- 16:45.380* :  the translator says it was there when she translated it? Where did it come from?
*16:46.060- 16:52.100* :  The mystery continues as the author omid scoby denies intentionally naming two senior royals
*16:52.400- 16:53.940* :  embroiled in a palace race route.

*18:09.860- 18:16.100* :  restrictions infringed on the constitutional rights of both users and businesses. Shinghai Nyoka reports.
*18:17.000- 18:22.120* :  The Montana law which would have come into effect on January the 1st sought to ban users from
*18:22.120- 18:28.420* :  downloading the app. Download stores and TikTok would have faced fines of $10,000 per day for each
*18:28.420- 18:34.540* :  violation. But a US district judge blocked the ban, ruling that it violated the constitutional rights
*18:34.540- 18:40.160* :  of users and businesses. He also accused lawmakers of being too fixated on China's influence.
*18:40.180- 18:45.720* :  The judgement is an important test for other states mulling similar bans. It comes amidst a
*18:45.720- 18:50.000* :  growing fear that TikTok could hand over sensitive user data to the Chinese government.
*18:50.540- 18:53.680* :  It's something the video platform has repeatedly denied it would do.
*18:54.740- 19:00.140* :  Well next, lured to Myanmar with the promise of good jobs and then forced into crime. Well,
*19:00.140- 19:04.460* :  that's what seems to have happened to more than 100 Malaysians who've now been repatriated.
*19:04.880- 19:09.620* :  They were flown back via China. Our Asia Pacific Regional Editor Mickey Bristock told us more.
*19:10.360- 19:16.280* :  It's a very complicated story this, but it appears these Malaysians were lured to Myanmar by the
*19:16.280- 19:22.040* :  promise of good jobs, high paying jobs, lots of countries have high youth and employment.
*19:22.060- 19:28.880* :  They arrive in Myanmar and then find that actually these jobs don't exist and then they're forced.
*19:28.960- 19:36.100* :  This is what suspected their force into by criminal gangs into taking part in online and telephone
*19:36.100- 19:43.740* :  scams. We'll big issue in the stage here at the moment where try to essentially defraud people by
*19:43.740- 19:49.420* :  telephoning them on, contacting them using the internet defraud them of kind of lots and lots of
*19:49.420- 19:53.940* :  money. This group of Malaysians at the only group who have been found over recent weeks,
*19:54.500- 20:00.980* :  hundreds of mostly young people from Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, other countries in Southeast Asia
*20:00.980- 20:07.360* :  have also been repatriated after being located in this area of Myanmar on the border with China.
*20:07.360- 20:13.500* :  It's called Shan State. How were they found? Well, it appears that they've been found at the moment
*20:13.500- 20:20.380* :  because in this area over recent months there's been a real uptick in violence in fighting
*20:21.060- 20:26.540* :  between an alliance of ethnic groups and they've been fighting the Burmese army.
*20:27.220- 20:32.900* :  One of the aims of this alliance of groups appears to be to clear out this kind of lawless
*20:33.160- 20:39.000* :  border area where a lot of casinos were operating, a lot of gangs were operating these
*20:39.400- 20:45.060* :  telephone and an online scam groups. One of their aims appears to be clear out these groups,
*20:45.120- 20:51.860* :  these illegal operations and that's how it seems that these Malaysians and other people have come
*20:51.860- 20:57.820* :  to line. And what next for those who have been repatriated, I'm guessing it's the difficult job
*20:57.820- 21:03.540* :  of rebuilding your life in some way? Yeah, it's a really complicated question here because as I said
*21:03.540- 21:08.180* :  at the beginning of this, they're suspected of being lured there to be involved in criminal gangs
*21:08.180- 21:14.340* :  and online fraud. But a few thousand people, a few weeks ago, several thousand people were
*21:14.620- 21:22.020* :  repatriated to China. The Chinese described them as criminal suspects. So it's not entirely clear.
*21:22.020- 21:26.920* :  Some of them will have been lured there with a promise of jobs. Some of them will be taking part
*21:27.260- 21:33.060* :  voluntarily in these kinds of frauds. So it's not quite easy to see exactly whether they're victims
*21:33.060- 21:38.020* :  or perpetrators. Of course, as you mentioned there, those that were victims, they're going to find
*21:38.020- 21:42.860* :  it hard to read just when they get back to Malaysia and their home countries. Mickey Bristol,
*21:43.600- 21:48.640* :  a former Haitian paramilitary leader who spent a decade on the run before serving a prison term
*21:48.640- 21:54.420* :  in the US has been deported to his home country. Geefel-Eap led a rebellion that overthrew Hades
*21:54.420- 22:00.440* :  President Jean-Betron Aristide nearly 20 years ago. Analysts say his return to Haiti after serving
*22:00.440- 22:05.160* :  a jail term will further stoke instability in the country where gangs have taken control of
*22:05.160- 22:12.120* :  large areas since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021. Jacqueline Charles is the Caribbean
*22:12.120- 22:17.100* :  correspondent for the Miami Herald. She spoke to my colleague Victoria Oon Hunder about the reaction
*22:17.100- 22:22.780* :  in Haiti. We know that he was released from a US president's September and people were expecting
*22:22.820- 22:29.880* :  him. She'd be returned to Haiti immediately and that did not happen. And so when we at the Miami
*22:29.880- 22:35.160* :  Herald broke the news that he had arrived back in Haiti, a lot of people were unaware.
*22:36.280- 22:43.040* :  He does have his supporters and so they have been anxiously awaiting his return. He was taken
*22:43.040- 22:50.300* :  into custody by Haitian National Police. A number of his lawyers were outside of the police station
*22:50.300- 22:55.400* :  demanding access to him. And of course, on the other side of this, there are people who are waiting
*22:55.400- 23:00.820* :  to see what does his return mean when you think about the current context of Haiti. This is a country
*23:01.500- 23:07.960* :  that has a political vacuum since the assassination of in July of 2021 of the Haitian President.
*23:09.180- 23:13.680* :  The current Prime Minister and his supporters have not been able to reach just some sort of a
*23:13.680- 23:18.260* :  governance agreement that will allow the country to go to elections. And of course, we know
*23:18.720- 23:25.100* :  that gangs have overtaken the Capitol and this week the UN issued a report that says that they are
*23:25.100- 23:31.620* :  also invading, you know, rural communities outside of what a prince. You briefly mentioned about
*23:31.620- 23:38.020* :  the instability in Haiti. Just to remind our audience, what is the political context of all of this
*23:38.200- 23:43.400* :  and what what Ghee Phillips deportation or repatriation to Haiti might mean?
*23:44.520- 23:48.780* :  Well, as you know, the Haiti is a country right now that's dealing with the number of crisis,
*23:48.780- 23:54.800* :  the very multifacet crisis is a humanitarian crisis. There is a political crisis. There is
*23:54.800- 24:00.800* :  gang crisis. Immigration advocates have pointed out is that on the one hand the United States is
*24:00.960- 24:06.440* :  deporting Haitians such as Ghee Phillips, but, you know, thousands of Haitians have been deported
*24:07.000- 24:13.060* :  back to the country since President Biden came into power and this is happening at the same time
*24:13.060- 24:20.980* :  with the United States is trying to get an armed security mission led by Kenya, you know, into Haiti.
*24:20.980- 24:27.060* :  I mean, today, Haiti is a country for lack of a better word. It's very chaotic and so, again,
*24:27.060- 24:32.720* :  when you see that you're returning individuals back to this country, everybody's sort of trying
*24:32.720- 24:38.900* :  to understand the policy and, you know, and that contradiction is what they view and what does it
*24:38.900- 24:44.300* :  mean? And as far as Ghee Phillips, I can't answer that question because there are so many more questions
*24:44.300- 24:48.840* :  are surrounding, you know, what happens tomorrow that we just don't know. I think with him you just
*24:48.840- 24:53.960* :  have to wait and see how he fits in and how his return fits into the current landscape.
*24:54.740- 25:00.000* :  Jacqueline Charles from the Miami Herald. Well, next, an author whose book has triggered a
*25:00.000- 25:05.140* :  row over allegations of racism within the role family has said the naming of two roles in one
*25:05.140- 25:10.540* :  edition was an error. Omed Scobie said he didn't know how a Dutch translation of endgame
*25:10.540- 25:16.080* :  included the names of King Charles and Catherine Princess of Wales. They allegedly discussed the
*25:16.080- 25:21.660* :  skin colour of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's unborn baby. Our royal correspondent Sean Cochland
*25:21.660- 25:26.040* :  is following the story. The publisher, first of all, said that there was a translation error
*25:26.320- 25:30.840* :  and everybody looked at the compare, they tried to compare the Dutch version with the English text
*25:31.380- 25:35.860* :  and I suppose what was most striking was that there were additional lines rather than lines that
*25:35.860- 25:40.060* :  could have been where there could have been some confusion about the vocabulary or the what was
*25:40.060- 25:44.960* :  intended. You can't actually just put a name in and say that's a problem with translation. These
*25:44.960- 25:51.220* :  are extra lines and we know the author of the book Omed Scobie has been very clear that he had never
*25:51.220- 25:55.760* :  submitted any version which included these names. He's been saying that through the week,
*25:55.760- 26:01.420* :  several media interviews. He's asserted that. He's also said very strongly this wasn't at any sort
*26:01.420- 26:06.940* :  of marketing stunt which again raises the question how did it happen? It's not at all clear yet.
*26:06.940- 26:11.420* :  I think this is a very much a live story. The publishers have yet to reveal their investigations
*26:11.480- 26:16.260* :  but how did it happen? How did it get there if the author didn't write it and the translator
*26:16.260- 26:20.600* :  says it was there when she translated it? Where did it come from? Something's missing at this stage
*26:20.600- 26:27.240* :  and has the palace reacted to this publication yet? The intimations have been that all options
*26:27.240- 26:32.660* :  are open which again kind of raise the prospect of legal action but it's not at all simple because
*26:32.660- 26:38.200* :  initially there was a reluctance to publish the names in mainstream media but it was all across
*26:38.200- 26:42.560* :  social media. Where do you go? How do you put it back? How do you put the genie back in the lamp?
*26:42.560- 26:46.920* :  It's the information's out there so their options are quite limited as well. I think they'll be waiting
*26:46.920- 26:53.460* :  to see whether or not this investigation shows this was a mistake or a hack or perhaps a deliberate
*26:53.460- 26:58.080* :  leak. I think they'll be waiting to see. We've mentioned already on the programme King Charles is
*26:58.080- 27:04.960* :  in Dubai. He spoke earlier on at COP28. Is this kind of overshadow some of the comments that he
*27:04.960- 27:11.600* :  made? I suppose he's one of those names. The timing is excruciating really because there he is
*27:12.900- 27:17.800* :  perhaps one of the biggest days of his year making a keynote speech in front of world leaders
*27:18.880- 27:22.720* :  on a subject about which he feels passionately but the papers are home. They're just full of stories
*27:22.720- 27:27.840* :  about a race route and who said what to whom two years ago in a conversation which we don't really
*27:27.840- 27:33.060* :  know about how it happened and it's the sort of thing where he wants to appear like a serious
*27:33.660- 27:38.260* :  broadsheet monarch and here he is dragged down to the tabloids again having to explain stuff
*27:38.640- 27:43.740* :  and not being able to in a way. How can he address this problem? It must be awful for him in a way
*27:44.200- 27:50.560* :  and I don't know how he balances those two parts of his Royal identity. And I guess just finally
*27:50.560- 27:55.520* :  now we wait to see what happens. That's the only thing we can do. Well that's right. We just want
*27:55.520- 28:00.520* :  to know how to do this happen. If we know more about that and that depends upon the publishers telling
*28:00.520- 28:05.500* :  us then I think then the story could move in lots of different directions. Sean Cochland.
*28:06.100- 28:10.060* :  There's nothing worse than not getting enough sleep. The recommended number of hours for humans
*28:10.060- 28:14.300* :  can vary depending on where you look but the old adage is that you should try and get around
*28:14.320- 28:17.940* :  eight hours. Well it turns out that penguins haven't got the message.
*28:21.440- 28:25.600* :  It's a very awake sounding penguin there. Well a new study suggests that they're actually
*28:25.600- 28:30.760* :  experts at having micro-naps. Our reporter Stephanie Prentice told my colleague Gareth Barlow
*28:30.760- 28:35.980* :  about this research. This was a team studying chin strap penguins. They live in the southern
*28:36.560- 28:41.480* :  Pacific and Antarctic oceans and the team rounded some up and they monitored them using these
*28:41.480- 28:46.940* :  electrodes that were implanted in their neck and what they found was an extremely unusual
*28:46.940- 28:52.560* :  sleep pattern. So these penguins instead of having a block of sleep as those humans are
*28:52.560- 28:59.920* :  want to do they were taking thousands of small naps a day. I'm talking up to 10,000 and they were
*28:59.920- 29:06.400* :  clocking up 11 hours of sleep in bursts of around four seconds. Now an interesting element this is
*29:06.400- 29:12.300* :  a suggestion that contrary to our prior assumptions the benefits of sleep can be built up incrementally
*29:12.300- 29:18.320* :  well in some species at least. The big question of course is how restful is that kind of sleep which
*29:18.760- 29:22.980* :  is hard to say but the researchers said since the penguins were breeding successfully they
*29:22.980- 29:30.440* :  must have been getting some restorative sleep. So up to 10,000 micro-naps of four seconds at a time
*29:30.440- 29:36.100* :  why would they do this rather than just sleeping for eight hours? Well it's working out for them
*29:36.100- 29:41.440* :  in simple terms and it's thought to be a matter of survival so these are their flightless birds
*29:41.440- 29:46.480* :  they're quite small and the research suggested they need to stay vigilant to keep themselves safe
*29:46.480- 29:51.980* :  so these micro-naps are the best way to do that. Now it also feeds into their parenting so with
*29:51.980- 29:57.400* :  penguins one parent tends to keep a watch over an egg or eggs while the other one goes out hunting
*29:57.400- 30:03.040* :  for sometimes extended periods of time the initial parent has to keep those eggs safe and also to
*30:03.040- 30:08.880* :  protect that nest because stealing nest material is actually rife in the penguin community rife
*30:08.880- 30:14.300* :  girls. Now in humans this sort of pattern long term it could lead to major impacts on how we'd
*30:14.300- 30:20.980* :  function and even long term health issues but for penguins to study suggests it really seems to
*30:20.980- 30:27.160* :  be working and the team did know this indicates that sleep how sleep works could be far more complex
*30:27.600- 30:33.180* :  and far more diverse in any species including us then textbook so far would suggest.
*30:33.940- 30:36.060* :  Our penguin correspondent Stephanie Prentice.
