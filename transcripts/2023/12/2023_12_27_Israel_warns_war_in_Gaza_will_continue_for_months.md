*01:09.540- 01:13.160* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:16.060- 01:21.140* :  I'm Danny Cox and in the early hours of Wednesday the 27th of December, these are all main stories.
*01:21.180- 01:26.660* :  Israel's military chief has said the war in Gaza will continue for months until it's reached
*01:26.660- 01:32.580* :  the top leaders of Hamas. Serbia's main opposition coalition says demonstrators arrested during
*01:32.580- 01:38.600* :  protests against the result of disputed elections could face charges. Argentina's new president
*01:38.600- 01:44.600* :  has announced that 7,000 public sector jobs will be cut by the end of the week as he tries to tackle
*01:44.780- 01:55.220* :  inflation. Also in this podcast, decisions we make over AI in 2024 will be pivotal and will have
*01:55.220- 02:01.780* :  significant impact on all of our tomorrow's AI tells us why it's set to go mainstream next year.
*02:05.980- 02:10.760* :  The head of the Israeli army has warned that the war in Gaza will go on for months.
*02:10.760- 02:17.180* :  After launching more than 100 air strikes in 24 hours, including areas it previously said were safe.
*02:17.180- 02:23.200* :  Israel said it was increasing its military pressure. You and officials say around 100 Palestinians
*02:23.200- 02:29.460* :  have been killed since Christmas Eve. The Hamas run health ministry in Gaza says almost 21,000
*02:29.460- 02:34.960* :  Palestinians have now been killed since the war began in October. The Israeli Prime Minister
*02:34.960- 02:39.760* :  Benjamin Netanyahu has again vowed there will be no peace until Hamas is destroyed.
*02:39.760- 02:43.480* :  Our correspondent in Jerusalem Sharma Khalil sent this report.
*02:43.480- 02:47.780* :  There's been no let up in the bombardment of southern Gaza, both in Hanyunis and Rafa.
*02:47.780- 02:52.660* :  Two areas were more than 1 million people have fled from the north. Video footage shows
*02:52.660- 02:57.300* :  the destruction of family homes with children sifting through the rubble to find their toys and
*02:57.300- 03:02.780* :  books. One small girl, Amal, was at home with her family in Hanyunis when the bombs landed.
*03:06.760- 03:12.300* :  We were sleeping, then I heard a big bang. She said, rocks have landed on us. Our windows were
*03:12.320- 03:16.660* :  broken. And there is no prospect of the situation easing for the people suffering in Gaza,
*03:17.080- 03:21.480* :  or for the families of the hostages taken by Hamas who continue their protests outside
*03:21.480- 03:26.780* :  government buildings in Tel Aviv. The war in Gaza is not close to being over. It's the message
*03:26.780- 03:31.960* :  from the government. A view echoed by the head of the Israeli army. This war has necessary
*03:31.960- 03:37.840* :  goals that are not so easily achievable. It's happening in a complicated field. Therefore,
*03:37.840- 03:43.780* :  the war will continue for more months, and we will use different methods so that what we've achieved
*03:43.780- 03:49.700* :  will be maintained over time. Whether it was a week or months, the IDF would reach the Hamas
*03:49.700- 03:56.800* :  leadership he concluded. In a separate development police in Delhi say they're investigating an
*03:56.800- 04:02.420* :  explosion near the Israeli embassy in the Indian capital on Tuesday. Israeli and Indian media
*04:02.420- 04:07.620* :  reports say a letter addressed to the Israeli ambassador in India was found near the sight of the
*04:07.620- 04:13.160* :  blast, but its contents were not disclosed. Israel's deputy head of mission in Delhi said all the
*04:13.160- 04:17.820* :  embassy staff were safe, and Israeli security teams were working with local police.
*04:18.840- 04:23.120* :  The Palestinian president, Magmoud Abbas, has been speaking to Egyptian television
*04:23.120- 04:29.020* :  about the war in Gaza. In a rare interview, he accused the United States of failing Palestinians
*04:29.020- 04:35.340* :  in the territory by continuing to support Israel. Mr. Abbas leads the fatter political party in the
*04:35.340- 04:41.380* :  occupied West Bank arrival to Hamas. Ocaro correspondent Salina Biel listened to the Egyptian
*04:41.380- 04:47.540* :  TV interview. He used really strong words in describing what's happening in Gaza. He said it's
*04:47.540- 04:53.780* :  far more than a disaster and far beyond a genocide. He said that the Palestinians have never seen
*04:53.780- 05:00.240* :  something like that before. It's even worse than the Nakba, referring to the year of 1948 when
*05:00.240- 05:05.760* :  Israel was founded. He said that more than 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza, but there are
*05:05.760- 05:12.260* :  between 7,000 and 10,000 still buried under the rubble and no one knows anything about them.
*05:12.860- 05:19.620* :  He blamed the U.S. big time here, because he referred to the veto the U.S. has used in the
*05:19.620- 05:25.900* :  UN Security Council lately that has disrupted a resolution, a UN resolution calling for a cease
*05:25.900- 05:32.480* :  fire, and he clearly said if the U.S. wants the assault to stop, it will stop, because it's the
*05:32.480- 05:39.020* :  only country that can pressure Israel to do so. But apparently what's going on is supported by
*05:39.020- 05:45.260* :  Washington, that's his words. And he also said that Mr. Netanyahu's government is aiming to wipe
*05:45.260- 05:50.340* :  out the Palestinian existence, not just in Gaza, but also in the West Bank and Jerusalem,
*05:50.380- 05:56.980* :  and he referred to recurrent Israeli attacks against the Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem.
*05:56.980- 06:01.860* :  And he said that the ultimate goal is to push the people of Gaza into the Egyptian,
*06:01.860- 06:08.880* :  Sinai Peninsula. And a lot of reports have been actually talking about that the constant bombardment
*06:08.880- 06:14.240* :  might push Palestinian families to walk into the Sinai Peninsula. But again, he thanked the
*06:14.240- 06:18.960* :  Egyptians for not allowing this to happen, because the Egyptians have been very reluctant to
*06:18.960- 06:25.280* :  open the borders for the residents of Gaza to stay permanently in Sinai, because that, according
*06:25.280- 06:31.860* :  to Egyptian statements, will undermine the Palestinian cause. He said that he finds that the
*06:31.860- 06:39.180* :  Israeli argument about the right to self-defense is illogical, and he doesn't believe that Israel
*06:39.660- 06:45.680* :  is still keen on having the two-state solution. It just wants to wipe out the Palestinian existence.
*06:45.680- 06:50.480* :  And what's more important here is that he said that the Palestinian authority is ready
*06:51.100- 06:56.400* :  to run Gaza, and it has enough stuff and enough people to run Gaza. But that's a very controversial
*06:56.460- 07:03.320* :  issue, given the huge lack of trust between Hamas that controls Gaza and the Palestinian authority
*07:03.320- 07:09.880* :  on one hand. Besides, the Israelis have not accepted the fact that the Palestinian authorities and
*07:09.880- 07:17.060* :  Mr Abbas can run Gaza, given perhaps the lack of trust between members of the Palestinian
*07:17.060- 07:23.540* :  authority and there is a residence of Gaza. Sally Nebiel. Next to Serbia and de-government
*07:23.540- 07:28.720* :  protesters were again out on the streets of the Capitol Bell grade on Tuesday. Over the disputed
*07:28.720- 07:33.540* :  result of elections earlier this month, the country's largest opposition coalition, Serbia,
*07:33.540- 07:38.740* :  against violence, says the authorities are planning to charge people who took part in protests on
*07:38.740- 07:44.100* :  Sunday. Dozens of people were arrested after some of the crowd smashed windows at City Hall,
*07:44.100- 07:49.760* :  Guidalon, a report. A lawyer connected to the opposition said those arrested face charges
*07:49.760- 07:55.020* :  of calling for the violent overthrow of the Constitutional Order. It follows violent scenes at
*07:55.020- 08:00.500* :  Bell grade City Hall on Sunday. Police detained almost 40 people at the time, and have since been
*08:00.500- 08:05.640* :  further arrests. Opposition leaders accused the authorities of politically motivated persecution.
*08:05.640- 08:10.640* :  There's been no official confirmation of any charges, but Bell grade's chief police officer
*08:10.940- 08:15.640* :  has publicly accused opposition activists of attempting to force their way into City Hall.
*08:15.640- 08:19.300* :  Protests calling for the annulment of the election for the City Assembly
*08:19.300- 08:24.320* :  are still being held every evening. The opposition accused the government of busing in tens of
*08:24.320- 08:29.560* :  thousands of people to influence the vote. Guidalon, as we heard in the earlier
*08:29.560- 08:34.860* :  podcast, the Russian dissident, Alexei Navalny, has told supporters not to worry about him,
*08:35.140- 08:39.700* :  insisting he's relieved to have reached the Serbian penal colony where he's being transferred.
*08:40.320- 08:43.460* :  Mr. Navalny heard temporarily disappeared from public view,
*08:43.880- 08:48.120* :  but was located by his lawyer on Monday, newly incarcerated at the site,
*08:48.120- 08:53.300* :  known as Polar Wolf. It's now emerged that he was taken hundreds of miles by train
*08:53.300- 08:57.640* :  as the only passenger on a zigzag journey, ending up in the remote prison.
*08:58.280- 09:03.220* :  Patio Connell spoke to Mr. Navalny's chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, who said that the
*09:03.220- 09:08.560* :  opposition leader had effectively become the personal prisoner of the Russian President of Vladimir Putin
*09:09.000- 09:12.320* :  ahead of an election year in which everyone knows he will triumph.
*09:12.320- 09:21.040* :  It was surprising that we were able to locate him so quickly, because when he arrived in Harp
*09:21.100- 09:26.460* :  on Saturday, it was clear to him what was their plan. So according to the laws,
*09:26.460- 09:33.140* :  if you arrived in your colony, you are allowed to notify your lawyers and relatives
*09:33.140- 09:40.860* :  within 10 days. But on January 1st, Russia goes on vacation, like nothing works for 10 days.
*09:41.080- 09:50.480* :  So as he was put there on December 20th, his legal ability to notify anyone could be
*09:50.480- 09:58.740* :  postponed before January 2nd, so we will not be able to locate him until mid-January.
*09:58.740- 10:03.760* :  And that was the original plan. But because of the tremendous work that our lawyers did,
*10:04.300- 10:09.980* :  like sending it more than 600 requests to different panel colonies in prison camps,
*10:09.980- 10:16.020* :  we were able to guess that most probably he will be there in Harp. And Monday morning,
*10:16.020- 10:22.560* :  December 3rd, 25th, the first working day after he's been put there, our lawyer came to
*10:22.560- 10:27.660* :  that colony and was able to locate him there and was able to reestablish contact to him.
*10:27.800- 10:32.700* :  I'm reading on the Wires' agencies that this colony was founded in the 1960s,
*10:32.700- 10:38.620* :  as what we in the West knew was called the Gulag system of forced Soviet labor camps.
*10:38.620- 10:44.580* :  He seems to be trying to send a morale-boosting message. Whatever he says, how worried about him are you?
*10:44.800- 10:50.960* :  Well, we are worried. We don't forget for a second that he is a custody of that very people who
*10:50.960- 10:57.780* :  tried to kill him straight and a half years ago, and that he is Putin's very personal political
*10:57.780- 11:05.040* :  prisoner. And this journey, this forced journey with many stopovers he made in the last 20 days
*11:05.040- 11:11.740* :  is yet another group. So of course we are very worried. And well, the only protection, if any,
*11:11.740- 11:19.120* :  that still exists for Alexei Navalny is the spotlight of publicity. Putin has to be reminded that
*11:19.120- 11:26.300* :  the world cares about Navalny and that he can't just like hide him or kill him or whatever.
*11:26.300- 11:33.240* :  This is very important for us. And he himself has said, I am your new father Frost. I now have a
*11:33.240- 11:40.220* :  sheepskin coat. He is in a way saying things that will be read by Vladimir Putin. We can be sure
*11:40.220- 11:46.160* :  Vladimir Putin's following his movements, but can we also be pretty sure that meaningful opposition
*11:46.160- 11:53.540* :  in Russia is dead? No, that's not true. We are in the meaningful opposition in Russia.
*11:54.140- 11:59.960* :  I mean, we operate from our office and in Vilnius, but we have tens of thousands of volunteers
*11:59.960- 12:08.840* :  and activists in the country who put anti-war leaflets and refugees and who run a advocacy campaign
*12:08.840- 12:16.380* :  against Putin and against the war. We employ also hundreds or even thousands of Russian who
*12:16.380- 12:24.200* :  left the country to make calls inside the country and they put in anti-war. So the opposition
*12:24.200- 12:32.460* :  movement is strong because as the latest poll show now, three-fourths of Russian population
*12:32.460- 12:38.420* :  strongly and clearly opposes the war. Alexei Navalny is chief of staff alien at Volkov.
*12:39.260- 12:47.460* :  Now, meet Ada, a humanoid robot with an AI brain. I am Ada, the world's first ultra-realistic robot
*12:47.460- 12:52.940* :  artist. I'm sending you best wishes for a happy new year, filled with creativity and meaningful
*12:52.940- 12:58.500* :  connection. As we welcome in and new year, I hope you will join me and look into the future of
*12:58.500- 13:05.420* :  humanity. Decisions we make over AI in 2024 will be pivotal and will have significant impact on
*13:05.420- 13:11.500* :  all of our tomorrow's. As she says, Ada was the world's first ultra-realistic artist robot
*13:11.500- 13:18.180* :  launched back in 2019 and has contributed to various art exhibitions, including alongside human
*13:18.180- 13:24.040* :  artists. Created by British researchers, she's based on the ideas of Ada Miller, an artist
*13:24.040- 13:29.600* :  historian and director of the Ada robot project. He's been speaking to the BBC's Nick Robinson
*13:29.600- 13:36.620* :  on some seismic changes we can expect from artificial intelligence. AI is incredibly powerful.
*13:37.020- 13:43.540* :  It's going to transform society as we know it and I think we're really only at the very beginning.
*13:43.540- 13:48.320* :  We have in these explosions of developments things like Churchy D.P. that people know about,
*13:48.860- 13:54.880* :  but in actual fact, as more and more people get to grips with it, we think that by 2026, 2027,
*13:54.880- 14:00.680* :  there's going to be a seismic change as AI is in all industries. We hear words like seismic and
*14:00.680- 14:06.740* :  transform. Give us a sense. I know there's a new version of Churchy PT coming out. If you're an
*14:06.740- 14:13.380* :  ordinary punter, how might it change your life? Well, it's not so much whether you grab hold of it or
*14:13.380- 14:19.200* :  not. It's the fact that it's using you, the fact that it's on your phone, that it's collecting data,
*14:19.780- 14:24.240* :  the algorithms are harvesting that data so that it will be able to interact with you in a more
*14:24.240- 14:30.320* :  accurate way. And next year is a very big year for AI. We have indeed got Churchy D.P.
*14:30.720- 14:35.840* :  5 coming out, suddenly rather than just doing it as a text-based editor, it will actually then
*14:35.840- 14:41.280* :  start to do action. So you could say to your phone, could you book me the restaurant on Monday at 7,
*14:41.920- 14:47.320* :  Churchy D.P. 5 will be able to phone up the restaurant, speak to them audibly, book it for you,
*14:47.380- 14:50.760* :  and then come back to you and say, yeah, we've now done that, you've now got the booking.
*14:51.460- 14:56.420* :  Can you imagine how that's going to be useful in business, et cetera? It's very powerful just
*14:56.420- 15:01.760* :  on that one technology, but the most significant thing for next year is actually the arrival
*15:01.760- 15:08.820* :  finally of the Metaverse. What's the talk about for so long? It has been long in the
*15:08.820- 15:13.340* :  making and in light of some of the difficulties they've had to try and make it so it's safe and
*15:13.340- 15:19.100* :  do all the things that it needs to do. Safe, important word, we've heard so often this year about
*15:19.100- 15:24.960* :  how AI might be unsafe. No, you're not, we should stress, are you a computer scientist? You came
*15:24.960- 15:30.300* :  to this bar art. What conclusion have you reached? Art has been nine, it's not going to threaten
*15:30.300- 15:37.060* :  anybody, but we can actually tackle very tricky issues. So art is an incredible channel in which
*15:37.060- 15:42.480* :  we go and discuss some of these issues. And something like the Metaverse, it's going to be incredible
*15:42.520- 15:49.080* :  in respect that you'll be able to have these new worlds. And actually it's the world that we worry
*15:49.080- 15:55.920* :  about. I think AI is going to enable us to have very fake situations and we're not going to know
*15:55.920- 16:00.640* :  whether they're fake or not. So in actual fact, it is a very serious matter. You sound though
*16:00.860- 16:08.020* :  optimistic. I think I do believe in the side of us, we are all hobbits that want to do it well,
*16:08.020- 16:14.060* :  but we are always worried and tempted by doing it for harm. And I just hope that this technology
*16:14.080- 16:19.240* :  people will get an ethical consideration. And Ada's artwork is just basically exploring that
*16:19.500- 16:25.060* :  so that we can make some very sensible decisions. Adon Muller, director of the Ada robot project
*16:25.060- 16:33.720* :  a glimpse there into the future. Still to come. I welcome you to the Fellowship of Scholars.
*16:36.560- 16:40.980* :  We hear about the prisoners starting 2024 as university graduates.
*16:48.900- 16:54.460* :  Our world is changing and with change comes new challenges, from rising sea levels to coastal
*16:54.460- 17:01.000* :  erosion to extreme weather. Communities, scientists and innovators are addressing the complexity of
*17:01.000- 17:07.120* :  our collective global future with innovation. Discover climate next from AWS, a new series

*17:24.740- 17:28.520* :  Do you ever pass someone in the street and wonder what's their story?
*17:28.520- 17:32.620* :  I was a very traumatized kid. Everything was about wanting to be long.
*17:32.820- 17:36.260* :  Live's less ordinary is the podcast where people share their experiences.
*17:36.260- 17:41.760* :  We beat the races, but their dreams. I wanted to see what would a shop for shot remake
*17:41.760- 17:46.360* :  of Raiders of the Lost Ark with kids look like. And their secrets.

*17:58.700- 18:04.740* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast. 2024 is said to be the biggest election year in history
*18:04.740- 18:08.800* :  with more than half the world's population eligible to head to the polls.
*18:08.800- 18:14.220* :  National elections are due to take place in more than 70 countries, although not all would
*18:14.220- 18:19.800* :  meet the test of being free and fair. India describes itself as the world's largest democracy.
*18:19.820- 18:24.700* :  The Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reelection next year seems more likely than not.
*18:25.280- 18:28.800* :  But what does it mean for the future of India's democratic institutions?
*18:29.360- 18:32.640* :  Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein sent this report.
*18:37.440- 18:42.140* :  Almost a decade in power, India's Prime Minister's popularity has not diminished.
*18:46.300- 18:48.840* :  Earlier this month, there were elections in five states.
*18:48.840- 18:52.520* :  The last set of polling before the general election next year.
*18:52.660- 18:57.580* :  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP party may have lost Delongana in the South and
*18:57.580- 19:02.440* :  Mizradam in the Northeast, but it pulled off a hat trick, handedly winning, Rajasthan,
*19:02.440- 19:04.680* :  Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh.
*19:05.000- 19:11.900* :  I was surprised at the sweep. I was also surprised that the BJP won all the three states in the
*19:11.900- 19:17.920* :  heartland. Near Jajodri is a contributing editor to the Indian Express, a leading English language
*19:17.920- 19:24.860* :  daily newspaper. I think it means that it is almost a done deal for the BJP that's led by Narendra Modi,
*19:25.320- 19:31.800* :  because it seems that at the end of 10 years his popularity remains undimmed.
*19:32.280- 19:36.820* :  The way people vote in state elections does not always mirror what will happen federally,
*19:36.820- 19:43.280* :  but history has shown that the BJP can lose regional elections and still win general elections
*19:43.280- 19:49.960* :  decisively. The party's success largely lies in its charismatic leader and its nationalist agenda,
*19:49.960- 19:57.260* :  promoting Hinduism as part of the country's national identity. But India also lacks a political
*19:57.260- 20:00.360* :  party that can counter Mr. Modi's might.
*20:00.700- 20:02.380* :  Rahul Gandhi Jindabad.
*20:03.720- 20:09.840* :  Congress is the main opposition party led by Rahul Gandhi. It ruled India for more than half a
*20:09.880- 20:14.480* :  century, but it hasn't been able to recover from its 2014 electoral defeat.
*20:15.180- 20:20.420* :  On the campaign trail, Gandhi says that he is the kind of leader that will fight for the poor,
*20:20.420- 20:27.100* :  farmers and day laborers. It presents itself as a party for all Indians, but Congress hasn't
*20:27.100- 20:31.840* :  been able to deliver a clear message to voters on what the party stands for.
*20:32.120- 20:39.320* :  The opposition needs to get its narrative a right, a narrative that appeals to people.
*20:39.540- 20:44.840* :  Mr. Modi commands the trust of the electorate. People say he will somehow manage
*20:44.840- 20:50.660* :  to run India, rule India. Now that is not a sense of confidence they have about the opposition,
*20:50.660- 20:57.580* :  so I think they need to go back to the drawing board and face these questions squarely.
*20:57.900- 21:00.600* :  How do they counter the leadership of Mr. Modi?
*21:00.600- 21:05.540* :  But under the Modi government, there has been an erosion of democratic institutions.
*21:05.660- 21:11.080* :  Human rights groups say violations have increased and press freedoms have diminished.
*21:11.620- 21:15.060* :  It's an alarming path for the world's largest democracy.
*21:18.180- 21:26.800* :  But Mr. Modi and his BJP party remain extremely popular and are poised to win its third general election.
*21:28.740- 21:35.000* :  That report by Samira Hussein in India. The Japanese Carmaker Dihatsu says it's
*21:35.000- 21:40.900* :  suspending operations at all four of its domestic manufacturing plants after a major safety scandal.
*21:41.300- 21:45.220* :  The company has admitted it's been manipulating the results of safety tests
*21:45.220- 21:50.820* :  on almost all of its models for three decades. The factories in Japan will stop production
*21:50.820- 21:54.200* :  until at least the end of January as Mickey Bristo reports.
*21:54.860- 22:00.260* :  Earlier this year Dihatsu admitted that it had manipulated safety tests on a handful of models.
*22:01.020- 22:06.420* :  The last week it revealed that in fact 64 different makes were involved in the falsification of
*22:06.420- 22:13.120* :  test results, a practice which went back as far as 1989. It seems managers were under pressure
*22:13.120- 22:17.520* :  to keep production rolling. Investigators have raided the company's offices.
*22:18.140- 22:23.640* :  Now Dihatsu says it's suspending operations for at least a month that it's four factories in Japan,
*22:24.280- 22:30.760* :  which employ 9,000 workers. Thousands of its suppliers could also be hit and other car firms
*22:30.760- 22:37.220* :  that depend on parts from Dihatsu, its parent company. Japan's biggest car manufacturer Toyota
*22:37.740- 22:43.860* :  could also suffer damage to its reputation. Dihatsu has been making vehicles for more than a century,
*22:44.480- 22:49.900* :  turning out nearly a million a year in Japan. But now those production lines will fall silent.
*22:50.680- 22:55.300* :  Mickey Bristo, Argentina's new president, Havie Milley, has signed a decree
*22:55.300- 23:01.080* :  canceling the contracts of 7,000 public sector workers. The people affected were working on one
*23:01.080- 23:06.180* :  year renewable contracts that expire at the end of December. Leonardo Roshiro reports.
*23:06.720- 23:12.120* :  Mr. Milley has also indicated that 45,000 other government workers on long-term contracts
*23:12.120- 23:18.120* :  may be dismissed. Argentina's opposition and the union say his measures will worsen the crisis
*23:18.560- 23:23.540* :  and trigger social unrest. They said ironically that the latest cuts were Mr. Milley's
*23:23.540- 23:28.380* :  Christmas present to the country. The measures are part of his efforts to bring down rampant
*23:28.380- 23:32.380* :  inflation. President Milley's program is centered on cutting government spending,
*23:32.820- 23:36.800* :  pegging the local currency to the US dollar and deregulating the economy.
*23:37.560- 23:38.440* :  Leonardo Roshiro
*23:38.960- 23:44.260* :  For a group of prisoners in Chicago 2024 will bring them fresh hope. They're entering
*23:44.260- 23:49.040* :  the new year as graduates from one of the highest ranked universities in the United States,
*23:49.040- 23:54.200* :  Northwestern. Peter Goughin has been speaking to some of them after they were rewarded bachelor's
*23:54.200- 23:57.720* :  degrees. I welcome you to the fellowship of scholars.
*24:02.540- 24:08.840* :  One by one, 16 men were called to the stage inside a former cell house at Stateville Correctional
*24:08.840- 24:14.780* :  Center. They traded in their prison uniforms for scholars gowns and mortar boards.
*24:14.860- 24:20.580* :  Ready to start the next chapter of their lives as graduates of Northwestern University.
*24:20.620- 24:26.240* :  To talk about something being amazing while living in maximum security sounds like a silly
*24:26.240- 24:33.560* :  statement, but the learning experience, the personal instruction, it's like nothing else.
*24:34.180- 24:39.580* :  This is Lynn Green, one of the students speaking from Stateville a few days before the ceremony.
*24:40.320- 24:43.600* :  He now plans to pursue a master's degree in psychology.
*24:44.120- 24:49.040* :  When our instructors come in and they teach us, we realize that we're not so rigid,
*24:49.040- 24:54.420* :  that we're actually malleable, that we can still be formed and shaped all over again.
*24:55.020- 25:00.960* :  Northwestern started its prison education program in 2018, and it's helped dozens of
*25:00.960- 25:05.520* :  incarcerated people get associate degrees from a nearby community college.
*25:06.320- 25:12.140* :  But this is the first time that students have received a full bachelor's degree from Northwestern,
*25:12.140- 25:15.060* :  one of the most prestigious universities in America.
*25:15.620- 25:20.380* :  You have read novels, solved math equations, and completed chemistry labs.
*25:20.380- 25:23.980* :  You have taken courses in psychology, philosophy, and political science.
*25:23.980- 25:28.600* :  Sociology professor Mary Patillo gave the ceremonies closing address.
*25:29.180- 25:35.960* :  Almost every crime reflects a cycle and often a circle of hurt and harm.
*25:36.840- 25:41.920* :  Your stories highlight the complexity of what lands people in places like Stateville.
*25:42.420- 25:47.160* :  Government figures suggest that two-thirds of Americans released from state prisons
*25:47.160- 25:53.220* :  will be arrested again, and more than half will return to prison within just a few years.
*25:54.240- 25:59.900* :  But studies have shown those rates of re-arrest and re-incarceration are drastically lower,
*25:59.900- 26:04.060* :  for people who've pursued higher education while incarcerated.
*26:04.560- 26:06.760* :  Bernard McKinley is one of the new graduates.
*26:07.380- 26:12.180* :  He's also the first person in the state of Illinois ever to take the entrance exam for law
*26:12.180- 26:16.800* :  school while in prison, and he hopes to one day become a civil rights attorney.
*26:16.800- 26:21.880* :  Education creates a way for folk and critical thought.
*26:22.380- 26:25.200* :  You know, you can't help but do self-analysis until yourself,
*26:25.760- 26:28.360* :  and see where you were or where you desire to be.
*26:28.680- 26:32.940* :  Now, like many of the graduates, he'll stay in the program as a teaching assistant,
*26:32.940- 26:38.860* :  helping another group of Northwestern students to transform their lives from behind bars.
*26:39.400- 26:41.000* :  That report from Peter Goffin.
*26:41.700- 26:46.100* :  For some peering into your fridge at this time of year, you may well be faced with a fridge full
*26:46.100- 26:51.300* :  of Christmas leftovers staring back at you. In many English-speaking countries, this will include
*26:51.300- 26:57.420* :  turkey, often dry, and unappetizing rose potatoes, which looked so delicious when you sat down for
*26:57.420- 27:01.800* :  Christmas dinner. So how can you rescue them and reinvigorate your taste buds?
*27:01.800- 27:04.260* :  Here's Cookbook writer Miguel Barclay.
*27:04.720- 27:08.300* :  The classic option, the thing that everyone's doing, is the curry.
*27:08.480- 27:13.640* :  So turkey curry, really easy to fry up some onions, chuck in everything you've got,
*27:13.640- 27:17.260* :  a little bit of curry powder, maybe some chopped tomatoes.
*27:17.260- 27:20.000* :  If you want to go down the sort of chicken teak and masala,
*27:20.000- 27:23.780* :  sort of vibe, you can put some ground almond in there,
*27:24.220- 27:28.100* :  or a little splash of cream. If you want to elevate it a little bit,
*27:28.100- 27:32.020* :  we're looking at stuff like essentially what you do with a fish cake.
*27:32.580- 27:36.640* :  So we're going to mash the potato a bit. We're going to get one of those fancy egg rings.
*27:36.700- 27:41.140* :  We're going to make it an inch or two inches thick. It's going to be majestic.
*27:41.140- 27:45.480* :  If you want, you can bread crumb it. You put a little bit of flour, then a bit of egg,
*27:45.480- 27:49.760* :  then some bread crumbs, and then you're going to either pan fry it or put it in the oven.
*27:49.760- 27:52.800* :  Like that is a centerpiece. You can have it with salad.
*27:53.400- 27:57.140* :  If you're not really that into the Christmas flavour the day after,
*27:57.480- 28:01.080* :  go down the Thai fish cake, bind it all together with an egg,
*28:01.640- 28:07.740* :  put a dollop of some sort of spice mix in there, get the taste buds revved up.
*28:08.200- 28:13.560* :  One of the issues with Christmas pudding is that it is not as exciting when it's cold,
*28:13.560- 28:17.960* :  so something that you could do would be cut a massive slab of it,
*28:18.460- 28:22.840* :  and then pan fry it in butter, and then you get the saltiness of the butter and the richness of
*28:22.840- 28:29.020* :  the butter and the diet starts in the first a chance, so you've got this window where you can do
*28:29.020- 28:34.120* :  whatever you want, get up free. So take advantage of it and do something that's exciting.
*28:34.800- 28:35.680* :  Miguel Barclay.
*28:38.320- 28:42.460* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
