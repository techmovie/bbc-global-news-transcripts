*00:51.720- 00:57.940* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Friday, the 22nd of December, these are our main
*00:57.940- 01:06.140* :  stories. The UN warns of impending famine in the Gaza Strip. Pretty much everybody in Gaza is hungry,
*01:06.140- 01:14.340* :  more than 500,000 are starving. A student in Prague shoots 14 people dead on his university campus,
*01:14.340- 01:20.720* :  the worst mass shooting in Czech history, and Rudy Giuliani, former New York Mayor and Trump
*01:20.860- 01:26.520* :  seeks bankruptcy protection over a $150 million damages award.
*01:29.480- 01:35.320* :  Also in this podcast, White Abba is having the Taylor Swift effect on London's economy,
*01:45.240- 01:50.660* :  and the Oscar-winning actor Anthony Hopkins on his life and his new film One Life.
*01:54.900- 02:00.420* :  Two UN agencies have issued fresh warnings that there are no functioning hospitals left in
*02:00.420- 02:05.560* :  northern Gaza and that people across the territory are facing catastrophic levels of hunger.
*02:06.000- 02:10.300* :  In its latest assessment, the World Food Program's chief economist, Arif Hussein,
*02:10.300- 02:16.480* :  said many people are on the verge of starvation. That report just confirms our worst fears.
*02:16.480- 02:27.180* :  Pretty much everybody in Gaza is hungry, more than 500,000 are starving. One in every four people
*02:27.180- 02:34.960* :  is starving in Gaza as we speak. The UN found that Gaza's entire population of 2.2 million people
*02:34.960- 02:41.100* :  were suffering acute shortages. Some basic supplies are getting into Gaza, but aid agencies say
*02:41.100- 02:46.500* :  it's nowhere near what's needed, and distribution is being severely hampered by Israel's continued
*02:46.500- 02:52.260* :  intense military operations. Many hospitals and no longer fit for purpose. Our correspondent,
*02:52.260- 02:55.020* :  Shama Khalil sent this report from Jerusalem.
*02:57.960- 03:01.940* :  Yet again, the sound of shelling in Gaza, and there is no sign of respite.
*03:03.040- 03:06.980* :  Hamas officials say in Israeli strike near the Rafa crossing killed four people,
*03:07.460- 03:10.900* :  including the director of the Israeli-controlled Karim Shalom border crossing.
*03:10.900- 03:13.960* :  Israel's military said it was not familiar with the incident.
*03:13.960- 03:19.240* :  The World Health Organization says the bombardment has left northern Gaza without a functional hospital,
*03:19.240- 03:23.340* :  with patients in need of urgent treatment at risk of dying for moond infections.
*03:23.420- 03:28.380* :  Sean Casey from the WHO was part of yesterday's mission to hospitals in the north.
*03:28.700- 03:34.240* :  The whole of northern Gaza now has no functioning operating theater, no place for any woman who needs
*03:34.240- 03:39.840* :  to deliver biceterian section, no place for post-operative care, and as a consequence,
*03:39.840- 03:43.780* :  we're seeing an enormous amount of suffering, what I saw in al-Ahli yesterday,
*03:44.120- 03:46.600* :  was patients essentially waiting to die.
*03:50.940- 03:55.920* :  Hamas has continued to fire rockets with sirens sounding in southern and central Israel.
*03:55.920- 04:01.540* :  You enter inside, you see a workshop of tunnels that have been building tunnels here, come with me.
*04:02.040- 04:06.060* :  The Israeli military says it's uncovered a network of tunnels in the heart of Gaza City,
*04:06.060- 04:08.920* :  with entrances connected to the houses of Hamas leaders,
*04:09.440- 04:12.800* :  including one of the masterminds behind the October 7 deadly attacks.
*04:13.440- 04:14.980* :  Diplomatic efforts are continuing.
*04:14.980- 04:18.960* :  The Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, has said that Britain is pushing for consensus
*04:18.960- 04:23.080* :  on a new UN Security Council resolution to bring in more help.
*04:23.260- 04:29.080* :  Everything that can be done must be done to get aid into Gaza to help people in the desperate
*04:29.080- 04:33.780* :  situation that they're in. Yesterday I was in Jordan, where I saw the aid being loaded up,
*04:33.780- 04:38.960* :  that now is coming from Jordan into the West Bank, into Israel, into Karim Shalom,
*04:38.960- 04:42.180* :  and we need to see that grow, that is a good route for more aid.
*04:42.260- 04:45.980* :  It's hoped that a deal could lead to hostage releases, although so far,
*04:46.100- 04:49.620* :  Hamas has said it will only free more if there is a full ceasefire.
*04:49.620- 04:52.840* :  The group's leader, Ismail Hanea, is still in Cairo for talks,
*04:52.840- 04:56.780* :  and Israeli officials confirmed there were no current negotiations with the group,
*04:56.820- 04:59.580* :  but that communication with key mediators was ongoing.
*04:59.580- 05:05.060* :  Shai Makhalil reporting from Jerusalem. Meanwhile, at the UN and New York diplomats have been
*05:05.060- 05:11.060* :  continuing their efforts to agree the wording of a resolution in Gaza. One sticking point was
*05:11.060- 05:17.280* :  a proposal to have a UN mechanism, which monitors aid entering Gaza. Arab countries are demanding
*05:17.280- 05:22.360* :  this, but the US fears this could take control of the screening process away from Israel.
*05:22.800- 05:28.020* :  A vote by the 15 member security council has been delayed three times so far this week,
*05:28.020- 05:33.100* :  so could there be a vote tonight? Our correspondent at the UN is Netatorfic.
*05:33.580- 05:38.180* :  The best I've heard from diplomats is they'll see where they are at the end of negotiations.
*05:38.300- 05:43.280* :  The earliest would be at the start of this evening, but it's extremely difficult to tell,
*05:43.280- 05:45.080* :  given how these last few days have played out.
*05:45.300- 05:48.280* :  And what's the mood among the people you're talking to in the UN building?
*05:49.740- 05:55.340* :  Well, there has certainly been a mix of emotions. I think there's a lot of frustration from all the
*05:55.340- 06:00.720* :  other members on the council who are ready to move to a vote, who say they want to move to a vote.
*06:01.200- 06:05.360* :  They are very aware, though, that the United States doesn't want to be in a position
*06:06.040- 06:09.940* :  to have to use its veto for a third time and is trying to reach an agreement.
*06:09.940- 06:14.240* :  So there is, I would say, kind of constructive engagement on the council,
*06:14.240- 06:20.320* :  but you can see as the time is wearing on, everyone is just eager to get this to a vote already.
*06:20.500- 06:24.800* :  The more water down, though, any wording gets, the less use it's going to be, surely.
*06:25.300- 06:28.860* :  And that's really the position of the UAE who put this draft forward.
*06:28.980- 06:31.840* :  At first, there was this idea. Let's get rid of the mechanism altogether.
*06:31.840- 06:36.800* :  They said, no, that's a hard line for them. They don't think the resolution would be meaningful without it.
*06:37.420- 06:39.480* :  Netatorfic at the United Nations.
*06:40.360- 06:46.140* :  The Czech Republic has suffered its worst mass killing. A 24-year-old man shot dead at least
*06:46.140- 06:50.020* :  14 people at Prague's Charles University, where he was a student.
*06:50.020- 06:53.980* :  The gunman was later found dead, although it's unclear how he died.
*06:53.980- 06:57.920* :  The Prime Minister Petra Fiala has expressed his shock.
*07:01.860- 07:06.860* :  First of all, let me express my deepest condolences to the relatives and friends of all the victims.
*07:07.560- 07:11.760* :  None of us can fully imagine the depth of grief and pain that they are now experiencing.
*07:12.680- 07:15.800* :  Many lives, mostly young people, have been needlessly lost.
*07:15.820- 07:22.400* :  Like many of you, I feel deep sadness and disgust in the face of this senseless and brutal violence.
*07:22.400- 07:28.280* :  Our correspondent, Sarah Reinsford in Prague, gave me an update on the latest just before we recorded
*07:28.280- 07:29.560* :  the Global News Podcast.
*07:30.060- 07:35.400* :  Well, I'm just standing on the bridge now, looking right over towards the faculty of arts of
*07:35.400- 07:39.560* :  Charles University. The lights are still on. In fact, all of the lights are on in that building,
*07:39.560- 07:43.860* :  but there are blue flashing lights all around of police cars because the square in front
*07:43.980- 07:48.680* :  and the blocks around this building have been cordoned off still by police.
*07:48.680- 07:54.240* :  There is an emergency meeting taking place just in the other direction, close to where I am as well.
*07:54.240- 07:59.620* :  The government meeting with the President and the head of Parliament to discuss what has happened,
*07:59.620- 08:05.280* :  because this is an unprecedented attack. It's the worst mass shooting in Czech history.
*08:05.280- 08:10.480* :  Obviously, police investigation is underway, but they have been giving some details about the man
*08:10.480- 08:15.060* :  they believe is responsible and his motives. They are saying they don't know his motives.
*08:15.060- 08:20.400* :  He was apparently a high-performing student, but they do believe that he killed his father
*08:20.940- 08:24.620* :  in a location outside of the city and then he headed for Prague.
*08:24.620- 08:27.380* :  They believe that they had information he was heading here,
*08:27.680- 08:33.040* :  an armed man who was planning to kill himself. They then tried to prevent him from doing that,
*08:33.040- 08:39.520* :  but 14 people, 14 fellow students within the faculty of arts here were shot dead,
*08:39.520- 08:42.480* :  and we know that at least two dozen people have been injured. Some of them
*08:42.480- 08:47.540* :  extremely seriously injured in that attack. So, just take a listen to this clip. It's a witness,
*08:47.800- 08:53.080* :  one of the professors at the university. So, I was in the auditorium. I was giving a lecture
*08:53.080- 08:58.200* :  at the moment. We first didn't quite realize what happened, and then at some point,
*08:58.200- 09:03.080* :  the special operation groups went storming in. They searched the room briefly,
*09:03.620- 09:06.900* :  and then went out, after which we, and they stayed up until they saw us inside.
*09:06.960- 09:11.880* :  And then, one hour later, another police squad broken and then put us on the floor,
*09:11.880- 09:14.960* :  briefly searched us, and then evacuated from the building.
*09:15.340- 09:20.120* :  Sarah, the country in shock? Yeah, that's right. This is on a scale that no one has ever seen before.
*09:20.440- 09:24.360* :  People in shock, people horrified, the Prime Minister talking about an utterly unjustified
*09:24.360- 09:29.480* :  attack, talking about his deep sadness and his disgust. The police also saying that they
*09:29.480- 09:34.720* :  discovered a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, and saying that this attack could have been
*09:34.780- 09:38.280* :  even worse than it was, although, of course, it was horrifically deadly.
*09:38.820- 09:43.180* :  Sarah Rensford in Prague. The president of football's governing body,
*09:43.180- 09:48.160* :  FIFA, says nothing has been changed by ruling from the European Union's highest court,
*09:48.160- 09:52.900* :  that football's governing bodies were wrong to ban a breakaway super league two years ago.
*09:53.260- 09:57.140* :  Gianni in Fantino says they organised the best competitions in the world,
*09:57.680- 10:02.800* :  and this would continue. The company behind the project has since announced plans for an even
*10:02.800- 10:08.900* :  bigger tournament. Our sports news correspondent Alex Kapstik has been gauging reaction to the
*10:08.900- 10:13.200* :  announcement. Plans for the Rebel Tournament collapse soon after they were first revealed
*10:13.200- 10:20.740* :  in April 2021 amid widespread protests among fans. This ruling has revived the idea of a breakaway
*10:20.740- 10:25.260* :  competition. It was welcomed by the only remaining clubs from the original venture,
*10:25.260- 10:31.000* :  the Spanish Giants Barcelona and Real Madrid. UEFA's president Alexander Shefferen said the
*10:31.000- 10:36.300* :  organisation wouldn't try to stop the creation of a new league, but questioned how much support it
*10:36.300- 10:41.980* :  would get, suggesting it would involve as few as two teams. The British government doubled down
*10:41.980- 10:46.620* :  on its determination to protect the domestic leagues. The Home Secretary James Clevelies
*10:46.620- 10:50.200* :  said with a new independent regulator for English football on the way,
*10:50.600- 10:54.460* :  there would be legislation to prevent clubs from joining a breakaway competition.
*10:54.860- 10:59.040* :  We were deeply uncomfortable with a breakaway league. The fans told us they didn't want a breakaway
*10:59.040- 11:03.180* :  league. The fans told us they wanted us to take action, so we have taken action. We'll continue
*11:03.800- 11:08.260* :  to do so to make sure that fan-led review and the findings that have come out of it are
*11:08.260- 11:14.560* :  implemented and we will be underpinned to legislation. Manchester United and Bayern Munich have
*11:14.560- 11:19.820* :  both issued statements saying they're committed to UEFA's competitions, while Spain's top division
*11:19.820- 11:26.000* :  La Liga describe the super league as a selfish and elitist model. Fan groups across Europe were
*11:26.000- 11:33.260* :  also dismissive of the new proposal. Alex Kapstik. The authorities in Paraguay say they've regained
*11:33.260- 11:38.180* :  control of their largest prison, which was being controlled by an imprisoned gangsta for two
*11:38.180- 11:44.340* :  months. At least 11 inmates and a police officer were killed in the big operation to wrestle back
*11:44.340- 11:50.460* :  control of the Tecumbo prison. 700 inmates have been sent to other jails, including the leader
*11:50.760- 11:56.780* :  of one of Paraguay's biggest drug cartels, Armando Javier Rotella. He was in charge of what's
*11:56.780- 12:01.980* :  known as the jungle, an area of the prison where he had been living with his pregnant wife,
*12:01.980- 12:08.400* :  three pit bull terriers, several fighting cockroaches and where he ran a small supermarket.
*12:08.460- 12:14.880* :  Davina Gupta spoke to journalist Santi Canary Tamaran from the capital Ascension.
*12:15.260- 12:20.680* :  According to the president of Paraguay, Santiago Peña, the massive operation inside Tecumbo
*12:20.680- 12:28.360* :  prison was needed because Javier Rotella, a narco big boss of the mafia, was ruling the prison
*12:28.360- 12:33.220* :  instead of the state. It was not the government or the police who was ruling the prison,
*12:33.220- 12:40.080* :  it was Javier Rotella. So this operation with 2000 soldiers and policemen went inside the prison
*12:40.080- 12:49.240* :  for the first time in years. So this was a already brutal operation because a policeman died
*12:49.240- 12:56.100* :  in service and another 11 inmates that were inside that also died because the shoots inside
*12:56.100- 13:01.880* :  during the morning. It seems like a large-scale operation but for two months, Javier Rotella was allowed
*13:01.880- 13:09.460* :  to run the prison with his gang and from the reports, that part of the jail was known as the jungle,
*13:09.460- 13:15.900* :  he was living with his pregnant wife, three pit bulls, how? It's difficult to understand from Europe
*13:15.900- 13:21.960* :  where the prisons are very well controlled. Here, Tecumbo is the biggest prison in Paraguay,
*13:22.220- 13:28.760* :  where more or less 3,000 to 4,000 inmates live here in the area, with only 40 guardians,
*13:28.760- 13:36.440* :  or maybe 30 depending in the night or the day. So there is an agreement between inmates and
*13:36.440- 13:44.920* :  guardians and government to stay quiet without making many noise but everybody doing many illegal
*13:44.920- 13:50.980* :  businesses around the inmates because there is no way to get food or to get drugs and there is
*13:50.980- 13:56.300* :  many people that need drugs to leave because they are addicts and there is no way to get all these
*13:56.300- 14:01.920* :  things or the basic services inside the prison without paying and you have to pay for your jail,
*14:01.920- 14:08.480* :  you have to pay for everything, for the soap, for the water and you pay other inmates and to other
*14:08.480- 14:15.820* :  guardians and not to the state. So Javier Rotella was like the boss of this mafia inside the prison
*14:16.100- 14:21.380* :  and he was taking money from all the inmates at the same time, he was building his own palace
*14:21.380- 14:27.620* :  inside the prison. The Tecumbo prison is very big, so he is divided in different spaces. One of
*14:27.620- 14:34.920* :  them is the jungle where he was training new criminal acts in Paraguay and in Brazil. In this
*14:34.920- 14:41.800* :  place, it's big enough to have his own room with computers, with internet, with phones, he had
*14:41.800- 14:48.820* :  this machine to pay with credit card. It's very crazy to see inside the prison and it's possible
*14:48.820- 14:54.080* :  because corruption. From what I was reading, according to reports from the national mechanism for
*14:54.080- 15:00.660* :  the prevention of torture, almost 80% of inmates have not seen a judge and it can take between
*15:00.660- 15:06.620* :  six months to three years on an average to get to the courts as well. I have been working with them
*15:06.620- 15:12.680* :  for the last ten years. I was a volunteer for three years. They explained that the corruption
*15:12.680- 15:19.260* :  in the justice system in Paraguay is so huge that there is at least 80% of the population inside
*15:19.260- 15:26.420* :  the prisons that cannot see a judge yet. They didn't went to a trial, so they can stay inside
*15:26.420- 15:32.040* :  Tecumbo. For example, for three months, six months, three years, people have been
*15:32.040- 15:36.640* :  in Tecumbo for five or six years without knowing if they are guilty or not.
*15:37.180- 15:42.860* :  Journalist, Santi Canary Tamarin. A show by the Swedish pop legends,
*15:42.860- 15:49.820* :  Abba is estimated to have contributed more than $400 million to the London economy in its first
*15:49.820- 15:55.500* :  year. Abba's voyage show, which is a virtual concert featuring projections of the band,
*15:55.500- 16:01.160* :  has packed out the arena in Stratford in East London. Figures show its pumped money
*16:01.160- 16:08.220* :  into less affluent areas too. Entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson has the details on all the
*16:08.700- 16:12.080* :  money, money, money, the 3D avatars have been making.
*16:17.000- 16:22.040* :  Voyage opened in May last year in a purpose built arena two minutes walk from what was the
*16:22.040- 16:27.780* :  2012 Olympic Stadium. In the following 12 months, more than a million people saw the Abba show
*16:27.780- 16:34.640* :  with a fifth coming from outside the UK. It brought in 320 million pounds to the London economy.
*16:38.180- 16:43.520* :  Abba's arena can be fully dismantled and rebuilt elsewhere. It found its current location
*16:43.520- 16:48.740* :  with the help of the London Legacy Development Corporation, which was created to redevelop
*16:48.740- 16:55.220* :  East London after the Olympics. Mark Kamley is the executive director for park operations and venues.
*16:55.500- 17:00.320* :  We were able to find them, I say, on the park, which is spirit at the moment because it will
*17:00.320- 17:04.520* :  soon be housing. We're in close to discussion with them about how long they would like to stay.
*17:04.520- 17:10.520* :  We are delighted with how well it has gone, but recognised that actually building housing is
*17:10.520- 17:13.780* :  also important for London so, but while they're here, we all want to enjoy it.
*17:18.960- 17:24.380* :  Abba have sung about empty houses, but it's new houses which will eventually force them to move.
*17:24.420- 17:32.500* :  They're licensed in three years. The band will hope that today's figures increase the chance
*17:39.920- 17:40.900* :  of it being renewed. Colin Patterson
*17:43.780- 17:46.540* :  Still to come in the global news podcast.
*17:48.920- 17:53.280* :  We all remember our childhood, the decorations, the smell of the Christmas tree,
*17:53.280- 17:58.740* :  but come on, times have changed. We are in an ecological transition, a climate transition.
*17:59.160- 18:03.320* :  Is it time to ditch buying a real Christmas tree for the sake of the planet?
*18:12.200- 18:15.740* :  The Indian Parliament has passed three new bills in a significant
*18:15.740- 18:22.460* :  overhaul of the colonial-era penal code. The Home Minister Amit Shah said the new bills prioritise
*18:22.460- 18:27.940* :  justice over punishment, but rights campaigners say parts of the new terrorism laws threaten
*18:27.940- 18:33.920* :  freedom of expression. Here's Lipeka Palam. The new laws quickly pass through both houses of the
*18:33.920- 18:39.320* :  Indian Parliament over two days. The legal overhaul is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu
*18:39.320- 18:45.220* :  nationalist government's latest effort to remove symbols of colonial rule from India's educational
*18:45.220- 18:51.480* :  and political institutions. The bills remove references to the British monarchy and redefine
*18:51.480- 18:57.060* :  terrorism offences. New provisions include the death penalty for those convicted of the rape of
*18:57.060- 19:03.080* :  a child or taking part in mob lynchings, as well as a 20-year minimum sentence for gang rape,
*19:03.080- 19:08.840* :  adultery and gay sex are not listed as crimes in the new bill. Transgender has been included
*19:08.840- 19:16.020* :  in the definition of gender. Lipeka Palam. Rudy Giuliani, a close ally of Donald Trump,
*19:16.020- 19:21.800* :  and once one of his lawyers has filed for bankruptcy, it comes a week after he was ordered to pay
*19:21.800- 19:28.380* :  nearly $150 million to two Georgia election workers for repeatedly lying that they'd carried
*19:28.380- 19:34.760* :  out electoral fraud in favour of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential campaign. On Wednesday,
*19:34.760- 19:39.560* :  Mr. Giuliani was told by a judge he must pay the penalty immediately. His response,
*19:39.580- 19:46.040* :  his lawyers have filed papers listing his debts at around $500 million and his assets at less than
*19:46.040- 19:52.800* :  $10 million. I asked our correspondent in Washington, Gary O'Donohue, why? Because he's broke.
*19:53.040- 19:57.760* :  I mean, he simply doesn't have the money to pay his liabilities. I mean, these liabilities,
*19:57.760- 20:02.680* :  some of these are, will necessarily be realised to the extent that lawyers suggest, but they say it
*20:02.680- 20:08.700* :  could be up to half a billion dollars. You've got this whopping great award in Georgia last week,
*20:08.700- 20:14.280* :  148 million, much more than the women themselves were actually seeking, and he's got various other
*20:14.280- 20:20.000* :  outstanding debts, including to the internal revenue service that collects taxes, to the state
*20:20.000- 20:26.620* :  tax authorities in New York, and interestingly, he lists Joe Biden's son Hunter as one of his
*20:26.620- 20:31.740* :  creditors, and that follows another court case. So basically, with Giuliani saying, I simply haven't
*20:31.740- 20:36.420* :  got the cash to pay from this, and one way out of that is a bankruptcy agreement, which, of course,
*20:36.420- 20:41.120* :  the court will have to agree to and hasn't yet. They have to agree to it, do they? Because it's an
*20:41.120- 20:45.800* :  interesting thing, the US bankruptcy protection status. Well, I'm no bankruptcy lawyer,
*20:46.280- 20:50.760* :  but this will have to go through a hearing, and I'll go before a judge before it's approved. You
*20:50.760- 20:55.300* :  simply can't just sort of decide these things. So they will take a look at that, take a look at
*20:55.300- 21:01.480* :  these assets. I'm sure, bear in mind, he has been accused in the past of trying to avoid paying
*21:01.480- 21:06.660* :  legal fees. For example, he was ordered to pay the legal fees for these two election workers
*21:06.660- 21:12.040* :  in Georgia, a couple of hundred thousand dollars, and that wasn't forthcoming. So a lot of legal
*21:12.040- 21:18.020* :  jeopardy, and of course, it does sort of hamper his attempts and his ability to stand by Donald Trump's
*21:18.020- 21:23.820* :  side and be part of his campaign and a part of his information war over the 2020 election,
*21:23.820- 21:26.860* :  which is what Donald Trump relied on, quite a lot of the time.
*21:27.400- 21:33.300* :  Gary O'Donnell here in Washington. British and French border officials are claiming success in
*21:33.300- 21:38.600* :  reducing the number of small boats crossing the English Channel. Britain has spent hundreds of
*21:38.600- 21:44.260* :  millions in helping the French stop the sea crossings to England, but tens of thousands of people
*21:44.260- 21:48.480* :  are still attempting the dangerous journey. Andrew Harding reports from Calais.
*21:52.260- 21:54.900* :  It's about four in the morning now, and I'm walking along the beach.
*21:55.040- 22:02.320* :  Some distance south of Calais dunes on my left. It's a cold, clear night, very calm, good
*22:02.620- 22:07.420* :  opportunity for migrants trying to get across the channel here, and just running to a couple of
*22:07.420- 22:16.500* :  French policemen. They say that about 20 minutes ago they stopped a boat from getting into the water,
*22:17.160- 22:22.920* :  just up ahead here, that policemen were saying they use thermal imaging. A lot of equipment
*22:22.940- 22:29.000* :  paid for here by British government, which has recently been giving a lot of money to the
*22:29.000- 22:35.560* :  French authorities to try and support them in blocking the migrants from crossing the channel.
*22:39.000- 22:43.600* :  Daylight, and in Calais, a visit by British border police watching drones in action.
*22:43.940- 22:48.760* :  So we can't even see the drone, but look at these images that they're taking. You can see the
*22:48.760- 22:53.940* :  beach and the vegetation. French and British officials talk with some enthusiasm of growing
*22:53.940- 23:00.140* :  intelligence coordination and about the impact of almost half a billion pounds in UK funding
*23:00.140- 23:06.660* :  being spent over here. We have funded a doubling of the number of law enforcement personnel
*23:06.660- 23:12.400* :  on the French coast. Chris Eastor runs the Home Offices Small Boats Command. We have seen significant
*23:12.400- 23:19.060* :  improvements in prevention of small boat launches. We've seen a reduction in the number of arriving
*23:19.060- 23:24.920* :  individuals this year in this way by over one third, and we've also seen the number of boats
*23:24.920- 23:31.200* :  reduced by 45 per cent year to date. But in Calais, Juliette de la Place from the French charity
*23:31.200- 23:37.600* :  Sucur Catalique is not convinced by tougher police measures or British threats to send migrants
*23:37.660- 23:44.540* :  to Rwanda. The situation is horrific. It is worse than before. Yes, there have been slight decrease,
*23:44.540- 23:50.280* :  slight change in the number of people going to the UK through the years. It will come again.
*23:50.280- 23:56.160* :  People will adapt. The networks will adapt. It is not a long-term policy. It is not a functioning
*23:56.160- 24:01.760* :  policy. The long-term policy that has to be implemented is to open safe and legal pathways to
*24:01.760- 24:08.900* :  the UK because people are dying at this point. We've just come away from the beach to a nearby bus
*24:09.020- 24:14.940* :  stop and run into a group of perhaps a dozen migrants. Some of them, particularly the children,
*24:14.940- 24:22.040* :  are wrapped in foil blankets that have been given to them by a local charity. It looks like they've
*24:22.340- 24:29.140* :  just abandoned their attempts to cross the channel. There's a girl here, 17-year-old
*24:29.140- 24:32.540* :  Faisal. She says she's from Iraq and she's here with the family of six.
*24:33.640- 24:39.960* :  Did you try and cross? Yeah, I tried, but the boat was broken and I don't going. The water was
*24:39.960- 24:47.400* :  up. The waves kept bigger. Yeah, I have no place to go. I have no chance. You're very sad.
*24:47.660- 24:51.000* :  Yeah, very sad. So what do you think will happen to you?
*24:51.900- 24:58.180* :  I have no idea. I just think I'm sure all my life is bad, bad, bad.
*24:59.720- 25:03.320* :  Faisal from Iraq ending that report from Andrew Harding.
*25:04.900- 25:09.040* :  The month of December sees the Christmas tree industry doing a roaring trade.
*25:09.040- 25:13.840* :  Millions of young furs are harvested every year from plantations which, in most cases,
*25:14.360- 25:18.820* :  attreated with chemicals to encourage growth. In the Bergen de Mountains in France,
*25:18.820- 25:24.640* :  local activists demanding that people change their habits and stop the Christmas tree monoculture,
*25:24.640- 25:31.480* :  Husco Field Reports. For some people up here in the Bergen de Hills, Christmas trees are not
*25:31.480- 25:39.360* :  an ancient festive symbol but an ecological danger. In this small plantation, you can see the
*25:39.360- 25:45.860* :  effects of chemical treatment. The ground beneath is dead. The grass has disappeared. Good for the trees,
*25:45.860- 25:52.560* :  no competition, no predators, but bad for wildlife, bad for rivers. For Muriel Andre,
*25:52.560- 25:58.500* :  a local farmer and activist, the conclusion is clear. We must ween ourselves off our seasonal
*25:58.500- 26:06.680* :  need for baby furs. We all remember our childhood, the decorations, the smell of the Christmas tree.
*26:07.060- 26:12.500* :  But come on, times have changed. We are in an ecological transition, a climate transition.
*26:12.780- 26:19.420* :  Everything that pollutes has got to stop. More than a million saplings are being cut every year
*26:19.420- 26:24.560* :  in the Bergen de Hills and then transported in lorries, down to cities like here in Paris,
*26:25.020- 26:29.680* :  where there is evidence that consumers increasingly are asking questions about how
*26:29.680- 26:34.000* :  Christmas trees are cultivated and the potential consequences for the environment.
*26:36.420- 26:41.040* :  Yes, the environment is definitely part of my decision, but it's tough. Do I buy a tree which
*26:41.040- 26:44.440* :  will last for two weeks or something plastic which has to come from a factory?
*26:46.600- 26:50.720* :  Where they grow the trees, I guarantee they're using a heap of chemicals and that's land
*26:50.720- 26:56.620* :  that could be used for other purposes. Nowadays, whenever we buy anything, ecology is part of our
*26:56.620- 27:05.780* :  considerations. Back in the Bergen de Hills, that growing ecological awareness among urban consumers
*27:06.220- 27:11.300* :  is having an effect. Here at No Day and Company, one of the biggest producers of Christmas trees,
*27:11.300- 27:15.960* :  it's two weeks before Christmas and the end of the rush. Most of this year's trees have been
*27:15.960- 27:21.080* :  netted and dispatched. It's a moment to show off what they say is the progress that they've made
*27:21.080- 27:28.500* :  towards more responsible cultivation. In this plantation, for example, they've reduced the amount
*27:28.500- 27:34.220* :  of chemical treatment and is grass and weeds growing between the young trees. Martin No Day is the
*27:34.220- 27:39.700* :  company's director general. Today, with all that we've made huge progress and today,
*27:39.700- 27:44.340* :  our plantations have become a refuge for biodiversity. There are plants and animals.
*27:44.920- 27:47.960* :  It's out of respect for these beautiful countryside which we love too.
*27:48.060- 27:52.560* :  So, Bopeik, Hongkongen, Rosimu, Boku, Roke, and Mara, producers argue that Christmas trees
*27:52.560- 27:58.920* :  take up only 1% of viable agricultural land in this area. That's true. But it's also true that
*27:58.920- 28:04.660* :  the cultivation of Christmas trees is almost entirely non-organic and that inevitably has some
*28:04.660- 28:07.600* :  consequences on the natural world all around.
*28:11.720- 28:12.560* :  Huseko Field
*28:13.660- 28:19.520* :  Finally, Nicholas Winterton was a young British stockbroker who, in the months leading up to World
*28:19.520- 28:26.180* :  War II, helped to save nearly 700 children from the Nazis by bringing them from Prague to London.
*28:26.460- 28:32.320* :  That story has provided the inspiration for a new film called One Life. It's being released
*28:32.320- 28:37.980* :  on January 1st and it stars the Oscar-winning actor Anthony Hopkins. He's been speaking to
*28:37.980- 28:42.700* :  our culture editor, Katie Razzle. There was nothing heroic about it.
*28:42.940- 28:46.860* :  Nicholas Winterton saved 669 children from the Nazis.
*28:47.180- 28:54.760* :  It's just a question of organising my work, but I'm in at no time. Why wasn't it in the mountains?
*28:55.020- 29:01.940* :  The trade now arriving at Platform 1 is the LA-847 International Trade.
*29:02.100- 29:07.180* :  The trains became known as the Kindertransport. When this modest London stockbroker helped mainly
*29:07.180- 29:12.280* :  Jewish children from the former Czechoslovakia escaped to Britain and a new film One Life,
*29:12.480- 29:16.380* :  Charts the Story. Do you ever think about the children and what happened to them?
*29:17.100- 29:19.780* :  Yes, it's said it from time to time. Do you?
*29:21.340- 29:24.700* :  No, not really. Well, maybe a little recently.
*29:25.100- 29:28.500* :  So Anthony Hopkins is a tour de force as the older Nicholas Winterton.
*29:28.560- 29:32.640* :  Winterton had no sentimentality, but he didn't want to be regarded as a zero.
*29:32.860- 29:38.240* :  I wondered how much responsibility you felt taking on the role of Nicholas Winterton.
*29:38.720- 29:43.060* :  I admired his sense of anonymity. He didn't want to be exposed or revealed.
*29:43.060- 29:46.500* :  I think he was quite a remarkable man because of his humility.
*29:46.500- 29:53.120* :  Nicholas Winterton kept what he did secret for 50 years, but in 1988 he appeared on the BBC's
*29:53.120- 29:57.500* :  That's Life programme in episodes that are memorable even all these decades on.
*29:57.620- 30:00.840* :  We ask as many as possible of these grown-up children to get in touch with us,
*30:00.960- 30:03.720* :  so they'd have the chance to thank Mr. Winterton personally.
*30:04.700- 30:10.060* :  Can I ask, is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winterton?
*30:10.060- 30:12.080* :  If so, could you stand up please?
*30:12.820- 30:14.960* :  Everyone in the front five rows did.
*30:15.600- 30:17.240* :  Mr. Winterton, would you like to turn around?
*30:18.000- 30:19.140* :  Including Wienarty Collins.
*30:19.500- 30:25.660* :  I had a temperature of 104 in chickenpox and my mother didn't want to put me on the train.
*30:25.660- 30:30.660* :  And our doctor said, if you don't put her on this train, she'll never go.
*30:30.880- 30:34.960* :  Wienarty Collins was on the last train that made it out before Hitler reached Prague.
*30:35.640- 30:39.960* :  64 of her family members, including her parents, were murdered by the Nazis.
*30:40.420- 30:43.180* :  I'm still finding out actually after 84 years.
*30:43.840- 30:50.600* :  And when it comes to Nicholas Winterton, when did you find out that you had been on one of the trains?
*30:50.600- 30:56.380* :  1988, when the BBC wrote to me in Cornwall, would I come up to Elstry Studios?
*30:56.960- 30:59.080* :  We're often wondered who would brought us.
*30:59.560- 31:01.800* :  And what kind of a man was he in your experience?
*31:02.320- 31:03.500* :  He was very introverted.
*31:04.060- 31:07.640* :  He didn't want anybody to know actually, he didn't want any accolade.
*31:07.880- 31:12.080* :  It's believed 6,000 people are alive today because of Winton's efforts.
*31:12.540- 31:16.780* :  Ordinary people wouldn't stand for this if they knew what was actually happening.
*31:17.160- 31:19.000* :  You have a lot of faith in ordinary people.
*31:19.680- 31:22.340* :  I do, because I'm an ordinary person.
*31:22.600- 31:24.340* :  Johnny Flynn plays the young Winton.
*31:24.540- 31:28.280* :  I know films don't change the world, but they can make people think for a bit.
*31:28.280- 31:31.460* :  And it is up to people to stand up for what they believe is right,
*31:31.460- 31:33.980* :  and hopefully this story can awaken that.
*31:34.120- 31:35.280* :  And Anthony Hopkins agrees.
*31:35.280- 31:40.240* :  What is tragic is this whole wave of pledges building again.
*31:40.840- 31:45.000* :  But like Nicholas Winton says, the only way through is compromise.
*31:45.700- 31:48.000* :  Give thought and heed to the other person's point of view.
*31:48.400- 31:49.400* :  Instead of the coach, we know little.
*31:49.700- 31:51.540* :  No, you're wrong, I'm right, supporting.
*31:55.680- 31:57.620* :  These days, as well as appearing in films,
*31:57.620- 32:00.300* :  Anthony Hopkins is a social media star.
*32:00.720- 32:03.620* :  He has nearly 5 million followers on Instagram alone.
*32:05.000- 32:05.960* :  What drives you?
*32:06.080- 32:07.540* :  Who is the real Anthony Hopkins?
*32:07.540- 32:10.960* :  Oh, the real Andy Hopkins, well, I'm surprised I'm still here.
*32:11.800- 32:14.600* :  I've been a sinner all my life, I've been a bad boy.
*32:14.980- 32:16.920* :  I'm just grateful to get up in the morning.
*32:16.920- 32:19.620* :  I paint and I play the piano and I write music.
*32:19.940- 32:22.220* :  I have to because we're a long time dead.
*32:22.920- 32:25.120* :  And I relish every moment I've got now.
*32:25.580- 32:28.920* :  I've been through all kinds of crises, I suppose, as we all do.
*32:29.560- 32:31.480* :  And I've come out of this side of it, and I think,
*32:31.480- 32:35.080* :  well, whatever happens now, I've had the best life I could ever imagine.
*32:35.800- 32:37.860* :  And one more is there, really.
*32:41.300- 32:44.180* :  Anthony Hopkins ending that report by Katie Razzle.
*32:46.860- 32:50.500* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition
*32:50.500- 32:52.360* :  of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:53.020- 32:55.700* :  This edition was mixed by Joe McCartney,
*32:55.720- 32:57.920* :  and the producer was Emma Joseph.
*32:57.920- 33:00.320* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*33:00.700- 33:03.240* :  I'm Alex Ritson, until next time, goodbye.
