*01:29.180- 01:30.340* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
*01:30.340- 01:32.420* :  This edition is published in the early hours of Friday,
*01:32.420- 01:33.760* :  the 15th of December.
*01:34.380- 01:37.260* :  EU leaders agree to open accession talks with Ukraine.
*01:37.780- 01:41.500* :  We are on their side and this decision made by the member says
*01:41.500- 01:45.200* :  is extremely important for the credibility of the European Union.
*01:45.500- 01:47.720* :  But will Ukraine join anytime soon?
*01:47.740- 01:50.700* :  Despite American pressure to reduce civilian casualties,
*01:50.700- 01:54.260* :  the Israeli Prime Minister tells the U.S. National Security Advisor
*01:54.740- 01:58.700* :  the war against Thomas will continue until absolute victory is achieved.
*01:59.540- 02:02.800* :  And the leaders of Venezuela and Guyana meet to discuss their border dispute.
*02:05.560- 02:11.360* :  Also in the podcast, a British boy missing for six years turns up in France and...
*02:17.640- 02:23.080* :  The Barbie director becomes the youngest president of the CAM film jury for nearly six decades.
*02:28.040- 02:31.780* :  Since the pro EU uprising in Ukraine 10 years ago,
*02:31.780- 02:37.260* :  Vladimir Putin has been working to pull the former Soviet state back into Russia's orbit
*02:37.260- 02:41.900* :  and away from the West. Indeed, that was arguably the main driver of Russia's
*02:41.900- 02:43.560* :  full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*02:44.260- 02:46.920* :  But while the fighting remains mired in stalemate,
*02:47.240- 02:50.280* :  Ukraine on Thursday scored a big diplomatic victory,
*02:50.280- 02:54.240* :  as the EU unexpectedly agreed to open membership talks.
*02:54.860- 02:56.620* :  Hungary had threatened to veto the move,
*02:56.980- 02:59.880* :  but in the end its populist right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n
*02:59.880- 03:03.500* :  in effect abstained by reportedly leaving the room for the vote.
*03:04.100- 03:08.440* :  Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said it was a historic moment for the bloc.
*03:08.840- 03:13.060* :  This is really important. We want to support Ukraine. It's a very powerful
*03:13.560- 03:17.060* :  signal. It's a very, very powerful decision today and tonight.
*03:17.060- 03:23.660* :  I think to the people of Ukraine, we are on their side and this decision made by the
*03:24.040- 03:28.080* :  Member States is extremely important for the credibility of the European Union.
*03:28.600- 03:33.700* :  Ivana Klimpovich, since Zadza, who is chair of Ukraine's Parliamentary Committee on EU
*03:33.700- 03:37.040* :  Integration, said the news will be welcomed by many Ukrainians.
*03:37.540- 03:41.480* :  I think the whole Ukrainian nation is celebrating today because it's a breakthrough
*03:41.480- 03:47.320* :  and the real ray of light at the end of this battle that we are fighting every single day.
*03:47.320- 03:52.980* :  It's a slam in the face of our president Putin and finally this should actually
*03:52.980- 04:00.160* :  be very clear signal to him that his era of upper hand should be getting to an end.
*04:00.540- 04:03.760* :  Well, I heard more from my Europe Regional Editor, Danny Aberhardt, in Brussels.
*04:04.540- 04:09.380* :  In recent months, Ukraine hasn't had huge amounts to crow about in terms of battlefield successes.
*04:09.820- 04:15.760* :  So it's very important that it can show that the political processes of moving away from Russia
*04:16.260- 04:23.680* :  towards a European environment in terms of the value systems that it aspires to is very significant.
*04:23.940- 04:27.600* :  The Ukrainian Foreign Minister earlier in the week was talking about this being the mother
*04:27.600- 04:30.340* :  of all decisions. So it really matters.
*04:30.700- 04:35.520* :  But is there any realistic prospect of Ukraine joining the EU anytime soon?
*04:35.980- 04:40.900* :  These processes take years and years. You have to realize that although Ukraine has done a lot
*04:40.900- 04:46.380* :  in terms of some of the reforms that have been asked of it by the EU, it has a long, long way to go.
*04:46.380- 04:50.320* :  It's a huge country. It's a war. It suffers from severe corruption.
*04:50.320- 04:54.920* :  So there's still to be done. But at least it feels like it's on the path.
*04:54.920- 05:00.900* :  And you heard in Ashaal Michel's clip there that he used credibility on the line on this sort of decision.
*05:00.900- 05:04.820* :  The interesting thing, of course, is what Victor Orban did.
*05:04.820- 05:09.860* :  And it's hard to read everything. We've heard reports that he didn't abstain in the decision.
*05:09.860- 05:13.880* :  He actually left the room. And one official suggested that this was in order
*05:14.340- 05:19.040* :  then to say he didn't want any part of the decision. He's actually called it a bad decision.
*05:19.040- 05:22.520* :  So perhaps this was about posturing for a domestic audience.
*05:22.860- 05:27.160* :  Briefly, was there any news on the aid package that Ukraine is hoping to get from the EU?
*05:27.520- 05:30.000* :  This is the other big decision that Ukraine's waiting for.
*05:30.380- 05:37.400* :  Whether the EU will approve 50 billion euros, that's 54 billion dollars of aid.
*05:37.400- 05:42.200* :  It's a four-year package designed to give Ukraine some financial stability at a time when
*05:42.480- 05:47.040* :  that really matters for a country at war. There's been long and torturous negotiations
*05:47.180- 05:53.020* :  about this and how it may occur. The signs from some tip of that seem to be that there is
*05:53.020- 05:57.600* :  something in the offing. We're not quite sure what and how it will be delivered.
*05:57.960- 06:02.860* :  Are you regional editor Danny Eberhardt in Brussels? The EU also opened accession talks with
*06:02.860- 06:08.880* :  Moldova and granted candidate status to Georgia. According to a recently declassified intelligence
*06:08.880- 06:15.860* :  report, the US believes Russia has suffered with 315,000 troops killed or injured since it invaded
*06:15.860- 06:22.980* :  Ukraine. Equivalent to nearly 90% of its original force. And yet Vladimir Putin told his end of
*06:22.980- 06:27.740* :  year news conference the war was going well and Russian troops were improving their positions
*06:27.740- 06:33.580* :  along the front line. El Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg was at the event the first in two
*06:33.580- 06:39.500* :  years. There haven't been many. In fact, any opportunities for Western media to get anywhere
*06:39.500- 06:45.860* :  near Vladimir Putin, since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, at least today, we were in the same
*06:49.620- 06:56.140* :  room. To a fanfare, President Putin made his entrance at the start of his end of year TV extravaganza,
*06:56.480- 07:01.420* :  half press conference, half phone in. In the whole, hundreds of Russian journalists,
*07:01.420- 07:07.240* :  but some foreign correspondence, too, invited by the Kremlin. For the next four hours,
*07:07.240- 07:12.500* :  the Russian president took questions from the media and from the Russian public. On the war in
*07:12.500- 07:21.160* :  Ukraine, he's sounding increasingly confident. There will be peace when we achieve our goals.
*07:21.340- 07:28.180* :  They haven't changed. Practically along the entire line of contact, our armed forces are
*07:28.180- 07:33.920* :  to put it modestly, improving their position. They are in an active stage of operation.
*07:33.920- 07:39.660* :  The whole event was highly choreographed, to present the Kremlin leader in a positive light.
*07:41.380- 07:46.520* :  One pensioner who called to complain about egg prices had only good things to say about Putin.
*07:46.700- 07:52.740* :  You're my favorite president, she beamed. Some of the messages texted in by the public,
*07:52.740- 07:59.340* :  which I spotted popping up on a screen in the studio, were critical. One declared that Putin had
*07:59.340- 08:05.680* :  been in the job too long. Another read, when will power change in Russia? But these were not
*08:05.680- 08:12.760* :  mentioned on air. And my question, to Vladimir Putin? Sadly, I wasn't given an opportunity to ask
*08:12.760- 08:19.240* :  it, pity that, because after nearly two years of war, I have so many questions for Russia's president.
*08:19.860- 08:25.000* :  Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg. The war in Gaza has already lasted more than
*08:25.000- 08:31.080* :  nine weeks, but Israel says it will take a long time, more than several months, to wipe out
*08:31.340- 08:36.380* :  Hamas and prevent any repeat of the massacre of the 7th of October. That time frame will inevitably
*08:36.380- 08:42.240* :  put many more Palestinians at risk of death or injury. Indeed, one little notice report by UK
*08:42.240- 08:47.200* :  based charity Air Wars found that at the end of October, Israeli air strikes killed at least
*08:47.200- 08:54.900* :  126 civilians while targeting a Hamas commander. The US has been pushing Israel to reduce civilian
*08:54.900- 09:00.480* :  casualties, and in particular, be more accurate with its air attacks. Ask whether he wanted Israel
*09:00.480- 09:05.860* :  to scale back its assault on Hamas. President Biden told reporters he wanted to see more done to
*09:05.860- 09:13.300* :  protect civilians. I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives. Not stop going after
*09:13.300- 09:17.880* :  a month, but be more careful. The US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan,
*09:17.880- 09:22.920* :  has traveled to Israel to underline that message. But after meeting the Israeli Prime Minister,
*09:22.920- 09:28.320* :  on Thursday, he didn't set out a timetable for any reduction in the fighting. Israel is going
*09:28.320- 09:34.600* :  to continue to conduct its military efforts to get after Hamas for some time. Because, for example,
*09:34.700- 09:40.300* :  they're going to continue to hunt the top leaders of Hamas, Sinwar, and Dave, and Issa.
*09:40.900- 09:45.880* :  And we don't know exactly how long that will take. So the issue really is when does Israel shift
*09:45.880- 09:51.600* :  from the high-intensity military operations that are underway today to a different phase of
*09:51.600- 09:57.660* :  this conflict, one that's more precise, more targeted, more driven towards things like those
*09:57.660- 10:03.400* :  high-value individuals. Jake Sullivan. So what exactly does that mean about transitioning? I asked
*10:03.400- 10:08.640* :  our correspondent in Jerusalem, Hugo Bachega. I think the White House has been very clear here that
*10:08.640- 10:13.920* :  they want the war to be over as soon as possible. And the Israelis are saying, well, look, we need
*10:13.920- 10:19.980* :  more time because of all the reasons Jake Sullivan mentioned that they haven't yet captured
*10:21.040- 10:28.060* :  leaders of Hamas, including the top Hamas leader in Gaza. And also, the Israelis are saying that
*10:28.060- 10:34.620* :  they want to destroy Hamas, but also to release all the hostages who remain in captivity.
*10:34.620- 10:39.240* :  But at the same time, I think the message has been very clear. There's growing discontent
*10:39.240- 10:44.260* :  in Washington over what's happening in Gaza, and there's growing international pressure
*10:44.260- 10:50.880* :  for a ceasefire because of mounting civilian casualties in Gaza, because of the humanitarian
*10:50.880- 10:57.580* :  situation that has been described as catastrophic by the UN. The Israeli so far have been against
*10:57.580- 11:04.060* :  a ceasefire saying that this would only benefit Hamas. So far, the US has been supporting this view,
*11:04.480- 11:10.820* :  but I think you can see the pressure is building on Israel even from the US, which is the country's
*11:10.820- 11:15.480* :  main ally. Yeah, the pressure is building, but even so, we still hear like the defense minister
*11:15.480- 11:21.220* :  saying it could last many months, and the Israeli Prime Minister saying we will go on until Hamas
*11:21.280- 11:28.600* :  is defeated. Exactly. And here in Israel, the conversations that are happening suggest that the
*11:28.720- 11:35.480* :  Israelis think that this phase of the war, these high-intensity operations are going to last
*11:35.480- 11:40.960* :  until the beginning of February. And I think for the White House, they want to talk about weeks
*11:40.960- 11:47.560* :  and not months in this war. And again, as this war continues, more Palestinians are going to die,
*11:47.960- 11:54.560* :  more scenes of widespread destruction are going to emerge, and the pressure is going to continue
*11:54.560- 11:58.780* :  on these Israelis. And at some point, a ceasefire will have to happen.
*11:59.120- 12:04.680* :  Hugo Bicega in Jerusalem. There hasn't been a major war between the South American
*12:04.680- 12:10.480* :  countries for many years, but could that now be at risk after a controversial referendum by
*12:10.480- 12:15.280* :  Venezuela, which backed its claim to large swathes of neighbouring Guyana, in particular,
*12:15.280- 12:21.280* :  the oil-rich region of Esquibo? The guy and he's president, Erfan Ali, denounced the claim
*12:21.280- 12:26.040* :  as outrageous. Since the referendum tensions between the two countries have been high,
*12:26.380- 12:29.860* :  these residents in Esquibo told the BBC how they felt.
*12:57.620- 13:03.560* :  In an attempt to defuse the increasingly tense situation, the two leaders held face-to-face
*13:03.560- 13:07.700* :  talks in St Vincent and the Grenadines. This is what the Venezuelan president, Nicholas
*13:07.700- 13:09.620* :  Maduro, had to say on his way in.
*13:13.340- 13:18.420* :  I come on behalf of the people of Venezuela, with words of dialogue, with words of peace,
*13:19.400- 13:26.300* :  and I come to seek effective solutions to the only way possible, which is dialogue and negotiation.
*13:26.560- 13:31.120* :  Nicholas Maduro, ahead of the talks, Tim Frank spoke to the Prime Minister of St Vincent and
*13:31.120- 13:33.860* :  the Grenadines and the man who broke into meeting Ralph Gonzalez.
*13:33.860- 13:40.900* :  It is important that certain basic principles are reaffirmed and there's a recommitment to the
*13:40.920- 13:47.100* :  Caribbean and Latin America as a zone of peace that we pursue matters within the framework of
*13:47.100- 13:54.620* :  international law that there be no threats of force or use of force. And then the question of
*13:55.280- 14:02.620* :  modalities can be established in order to look at certain issues consequential to the dispute
*14:02.680- 14:07.740* :  about a controversy. It's better that persons be talking rather than quarreling or fighting.
*14:08.520- 14:14.420* :  I'm not offering any public advice. I'm a facilitated interlocutor. There is a big divide,
*14:14.420- 14:19.940* :  but there are other things for persons to talk about for the leaders to discuss and to reduce
*14:19.940- 14:25.760* :  tensions to de-escalate the conflict. We don't want a Gaza in Latin America and the Caribbean.
*14:26.040- 14:31.180* :  Indeed. I spoke to the President of Guyana when Venezuela was holding his referendum. I mean,
*14:31.180- 14:36.660* :  and he was saying that it's extremely worried that this could be whipped up into a conflict,
*14:36.660- 14:40.680* :  but essentially this is internationally recognized as Guyani's land.
*14:40.680- 14:46.800* :  Let us look at scenarios which are worse than where we are in my brother. The companies in Guyana
*14:47.540- 14:54.860* :  exploring for oil, largely American. If you have anything adverse to American lives or property,
*14:54.860- 15:00.620* :  you can see where that would lead. Guyana is not a match militarily for Venezuela,
*15:00.620- 15:08.400* :  and it is built in alliances with other hemispheric entities. And if you were to have a conflict,
*15:08.980- 15:14.740* :  use of force, you don't need any imagination to see the kind of conflict where you're going to have
*15:14.740- 15:20.400* :  and the consequences going to be horrendous for everybody. And historically, it is always
*15:20.400- 15:25.780* :  better to be talking. President Lula, I got a call late last night from him wishing us all the
*15:25.780- 15:31.320* :  well here in the talks. I'm facilitating as President Pro Tempori of the Community of States of
*15:31.320- 15:37.880* :  Latin America and the Caribbean. See that. To which both Guyana and Venezuela belong. And also with
*15:37.880- 15:44.960* :  the Caribbean community, to which Guyana belongs so that we are all seeking to use diplomacy to
*15:44.960- 15:52.360* :  defuse a situation which could easily get out of hand and lead to destabilization and bloodshed.
*15:52.360- 15:57.200* :  And nobody wants that. Ralph Gonzalez, Prime Minister of the Caribbean Nation of St Vincent
*15:57.200- 16:03.540* :  and the Grenadines. And after the meeting, the Venezuelan and Guyana presidents shook hands.
*16:03.540- 16:09.200* :  We didn't get any details about what had gone on during the talks. But the Guyana's leader
*16:09.200- 16:14.340* :  said that Guyana would continue to facilitate investments and commercial partnerships
*16:14.340- 16:21.120* :  in the oil rich region of Esequibo, despite Venezuela's renewed claims to the territory.
*16:21.880- 16:27.340* :  Now, what do filmmakers Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton and Pedro Almodova have in common?
*16:27.340- 16:32.440* :  Well, they were all given the highly prized role of jury president at the Cannes Film Festival.
*16:32.880- 16:39.000* :  And now Barbie director Greta Goig is joining their ranks. And she's the youngest person to do it
*16:39.000- 16:42.340* :  in nearly 60 years. Madeline Dury has this report.
*16:49.280- 16:54.100* :  With the record breaking Barbie film under her belt, it really has been Greta Goig's year.
*16:54.480- 16:59.780* :  Highest grossing film directed by a woman, check. Over a billion dollars made at the box office,
*16:59.780- 17:05.680* :  check. And now she will be the first female US director to chair the prestigious Cannes Film
*17:05.680- 17:10.280* :  Festival jury. Stunned, thrilled and humbled is how she's put it in a statement.
*17:11.020- 17:16.280* :  It will be her job to lead a panel of filmmakers in deciding the winners of the top prizes next year
*17:16.280- 17:21.480* :  at one of the world's most prestigious film festivals. It's a big deal for Goig, recognition
*17:21.480- 17:27.360* :  that she has well and truly made it after years as a critically claimed actor, writer and director.
*17:27.980- 17:34.540* :  Women, they have minds and they have souls as well as just hearts.
*17:34.920- 17:39.040* :  Her 2019 adaptation of Little Women was nominated for six Oscars,
*17:39.440- 17:45.280* :  likely one of the reasons that festival organizers called her an obvious choice to lead the jury.
*17:45.900- 17:50.900* :  But their claim that Goig embodies the renewal of world cinema has ruffled some film
*17:50.900- 17:56.420* :  bus feathers online. Is corporate Hollywood slop the pinnacle of world cinema now?
*17:56.420- 18:02.040* :  One person wrote on X. It's wrong to choose a director who was made headlines to satisfy
*18:02.040- 18:07.740* :  a popular culture, said another. As Barbie leads the Golden Globes nominations with nine nods,
*18:07.740- 18:16.140* :  it could be Goig who has the last laugh. And still to come on the global news podcast.
*18:19.940- 18:26.340* :  This year I'm nominated for an album by Luis Figueroa. The category is best salsa album.
*18:28.400- 18:32.020* :  The acclaimed in Barbian producer has been nominated for a Grammy.
*18:40.280- 18:46.180* :  Returning to the Middle East now on the conflict between Hamas and Israel has resulted in 20,000
*18:46.180- 18:53.680* :  deaths so far. 1,200 killed in the Hamas massacre in southern Israel and nearly 19,000 Palestinians
*18:53.680- 19:00.260* :  in the Israeli operation in Gaza. The situation there is getting worse with bad weather and horrendous
*19:00.260- 19:06.280* :  sanitary conditions. At a news conference in Geneva, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees,
*19:06.280- 19:12.280* :  Philippe Lazarini said civilians in Gaza felt betrayed by the rest of the world and called for
*19:12.280- 19:19.120* :  renewed efforts to end the war. In suffering series, absolutely no competition and I believe
*19:19.120- 19:26.040* :  ultimately in this war there will be no winner. The longer this war goes on, the larger the loss,
*19:26.980- 19:33.900* :  the deeper the grief. So I think like many of my colleagues that there is absolutely no alternative
*19:34.740- 19:43.520* :  to a proper genuine political processor to end once for all the longest lasting unresolved
*19:44.100- 19:49.840* :  conflict. 75 years, it is time that this becomes a proper purity.
*19:50.500- 19:55.220* :  International editor Jeremy Bowen has been in Tel Aviv and the occupied West Bank,
*19:55.900- 19:59.960* :  reflecting on how, when and whether a peaceful solution might ever be found.
*20:03.440- 20:09.120* :  In a video, a woman is sitting next to her dead husband. We promised we would die together,
*20:09.120- 20:14.760* :  she says, and grips his hand hard as if the power of her grief will bring him back.
*20:15.580- 20:21.780* :  Muhammad, she says, my love for God's sake, get up. No, and abude their children were killed with
*20:21.780- 20:28.300* :  their father when Israel bombed the house where the family was sheltering in Raffa. War is a cruel
*20:28.300- 20:34.520* :  furnace, but its heat can produce changes that seemed impossible. Old enemies can decide
*20:34.540- 20:41.020* :  that only peace can protect them from the pain of war. Could it happen here? In the days after
*20:41.020- 20:47.320* :  the Hamas attacks of the 7th of October, I went to Gibbud's Bayeri which backs onto the border wire.
*20:48.160- 20:53.880* :  It was tense and the bodies of dead Israelis were still being recovered. I was trying to find out
*20:53.880- 20:59.900* :  what had happened to Vivian Silver, one of Israel's best known campaigners, for peace with the Palestinians.
*21:03.000- 21:07.520* :  Vivian's son, Jonathan Zigan, had hoped that she might still be alive.
*21:08.500- 21:15.240* :  So you were there, I was there afterwards, and her bones were in the safe room all the while.
*21:15.860- 21:21.700* :  After his mother was killed, Jonathan gave up his career as a social worker to become a full-time
*21:21.700- 21:27.500* :  peace campaigner. She would have been heartbroken. It feels like this war is a cause in itself,
*21:27.800- 21:32.560* :  and we can choose to act differently. When we act differently, we get different results.
*21:33.020- 21:38.160* :  You are still a believer in peace, even though these people came over into your country and killed
*21:38.160- 21:45.280* :  your mother. I believed that it can lead to a better future, now because beforehand peace,
*21:45.280- 21:51.440* :  as an idea, was absolute. You couldn't even say the word, and now people are talking about it.
*21:51.660- 21:56.180* :  The Americans have said when this answer needs to be an negotiation,
*21:56.520- 22:03.420* :  needing to a two-state solution, credible anymore. I think we should say out loud what we want
*22:03.420- 22:10.120* :  to happen, let's talk about what it looks like, and let's talk about what we are willing to give
*22:10.120- 22:17.700* :  or to concede in order for that to happen. Handcraft me, blindfolded me, gagged me, took me to the
*22:17.700- 22:23.320* :  military base. Issa Amro, a Palestinian activist from Hebron, will not forget what Israeli security
*22:23.320- 22:29.440* :  forces did to him on the 7th of October. Issa is well-known in Hebron, which has been a
*22:29.440- 22:35.640* :  flashpoint on the West Bank for decades. He is considered a troublemaker by Israeli soldiers
*22:35.640- 22:41.600* :  who are enforcing a curfew on Palestinians who live near the Jewish settlement in the heart of
*22:41.600- 22:46.880* :  the city. As we're talking, there's an interruption. So the army's coming, what do you think they want?
*22:47.220- 22:51.620* :  Intimidation. Good morning. Why must we stop filming? We have a
*22:51.620- 22:56.400* :  gravitation. We ask for good things. Don't film us. Second thing. Don't film us.
*22:56.400- 23:00.640* :  There's a checkpoint. We are allowed to film. No, no, there is law. I am the law at the moment.
*23:00.700- 23:04.420* :  No, no, you are not the law. It's not legal what you do. I know all my rights.
*23:04.460- 23:09.960* :  You are a very prominent activist. You don't hesitate to answer them back.
*23:09.960- 23:15.080* :  Yes, it's my freedom to fight. I'm using non-violence resistance since 20 years.
*23:15.580- 23:20.540* :  One of the Israeli soldiers carrying an assault rifle was listening closely to my
*23:20.540- 23:26.200* :  conversation with Issa. His eyes moved back and forth between us. He was wearing a black
*23:26.200- 23:33.080* :  ski mask. Finally, he butted in. Yeah, I have worked for me. I know them. I live with them.
*23:33.360- 23:37.700* :  I want peace. They don't want peace. They hit the women. They are violent.
*23:38.520- 23:42.500* :  It's kind of racism. He has workers. He wants to see the Palestinians only as workers.
*23:42.640- 23:46.920* :  He doesn't want to see me as equally human being deserve the same rights as him.
*23:47.120- 23:50.840* :  And I know many Israelis disagree with him. I used to meet thousands of Israelis
*23:50.840- 23:54.960* :  per year and we talk about peace. But unfortunately, the right wing in Israel
*23:54.960- 24:00.540* :  and the mainstream move to the right. Even attack Israeli seculars. Do you think the shock
*24:00.780- 24:05.560* :  of the war in Gaza will change things? It's two opportunities. It's either we choose to make
*24:05.560- 24:09.160* :  it deeper and worse or we make it as an opportunity to solve the conflict.
*24:09.240- 24:13.260* :  Because their security solution failed. Only peace is the solution.
*24:15.140- 24:18.820* :  Issa Amro ending that report by our international editor, Jeremy Bowen.
*24:19.600- 24:25.120* :  A British boy said to have been abducted in Spain at the age of 11 has turned up six years later
*24:25.120- 24:31.280* :  in France. Alex Batty now, 17, was taken to a police station by a concerned driver who
*24:31.280- 24:35.220* :  spotted him walking in the foothills of the Pyrenees. Our correspondent in Paris,
*24:35.220- 24:39.800* :  Hugh Scofield, took me through the story. He was on holiday in the South of Spain
*24:39.800- 24:45.240* :  with his mother and grandfather. He used to be sent from the outset. There's something problematic
*24:45.240- 24:49.040* :  in that because his mother was not his legal guardian. There had been a family rift
*24:49.340- 24:53.780* :  and his legal guardian was his grandmother. He was on holiday with the mother and the grandfather
*24:53.780- 24:58.360* :  and from the South of Spain they disappeared and the belief was them. The accusation
*24:58.660- 25:02.980* :  certainly made by the guardian, the grandmother, back in England was that the mother had taken him off
*25:02.980- 25:07.980* :  probably to some kind of cult or commune in Morocco, where it was known she'd been before.
*25:07.980- 25:12.400* :  That was the end of it. They were never seen again after that and it was assumed that they were
*25:12.780- 25:17.100* :  hiding out in Morocco or somewhere else. There were police investigations but they never
*25:17.100- 25:23.500* :  went anywhere. Until today, or yesterday, when this young man, now age 17, suddenly walked back
*25:23.500- 25:29.160* :  into the world in this unlikely setting of southern France, the foothills of the Pyrenees,
*25:29.160- 25:35.660* :  South of Toulouse, looking perfectly happy with a backpack and a skateboard and a headlamp. He was
*25:35.660- 25:42.500* :  picked up by this delivery driver and taken to a police station where he said, I am Alex Batti,
*25:42.500- 25:48.680* :  and I'd like to go home doing them now. Do we know, did he have to escape from this commune?
*25:48.680- 25:54.700* :  How did he suddenly turn up there? My impression is that there's no jurors involved but he was a
*25:54.700- 26:00.760* :  young boy when he went and his mother would have taken him there and his grandfather, presumably,
*26:00.760- 26:06.600* :  but the years have passed and he's grown to young manhood and has decided that it's not for him.
*26:06.900- 26:13.200* :  So I did not seem to be any kind of escape plan involved or any abuse of him. He simply
*26:13.200- 26:17.800* :  decided that he had enough was enough. He did not find this life particularly congenial and he
*26:17.800- 26:21.480* :  wanted to get back to the real world. He's govilled in Paris.
*26:22.360- 26:26.240* :  Staying in France and one of the nation's most famous music stars.
*26:35.740- 26:42.860* :  June was the breakout hit for Serge Gansborg back in 1958. A funny if also dark song about
*26:42.860- 26:49.220* :  a ticket puncher on the Paris Metro. Gansborg who died in 1991 has been credited with transforming
*26:49.220- 26:54.440* :  French music and a new Metro station is due to be named after him when it opens next year.
*26:54.860- 26:59.380* :  But thousands of people have signed a petition objecting on the grounds that Gansborg,
*26:59.380- 27:05.340* :  while talented, was deeply unsavory. Among the co-authors of the petition is Ludin and we've
*27:05.340- 27:10.100* :  agreed not to reveal her surname because the issue has become so polarised.
*27:10.460- 27:17.200* :  Gansborg was known in France for his provocative attitudes as what it was called at the time,
*27:17.320- 27:23.020* :  but we know now that Gensborg is a wife of the time, denounced marital violence
*27:23.020- 27:29.860* :  and beating on his part in her diaries. He has also always cultivated the fantasy of incest
*27:29.860- 27:36.600* :  in his songs such as La Poupe Quiff√©e promoted it. He said he wants to rape a little doll that
*27:36.600- 27:42.920* :  calls him daddy and even if it wasn't his intentions, when you sing a song like that in the culture,
*27:42.920- 27:49.580* :  it means something in the site, you know, people hear it and I am not saying that a third
*27:49.580- 27:56.780* :  gizmo committed incest and sing that he promoted it in his heart. I don't really think that other
*27:56.780- 28:00.880* :  metro stations should be renamed. I mean, it's not my fight right now, it's not our fight,
*28:00.880- 28:07.960* :  but what really shocks me and shocks us is that it's Gensborg's name is being chosen now
*28:08.340- 28:13.400* :  like in 2020, it's where you know, after me too, and the release of the stories we know about,
*28:14.120- 28:20.100* :  I don't want to like erase history and change the whole metro plan, that's not my point at all.
*28:20.560- 28:26.420* :  People are very emotionally linked to him and it's really a problem in France like
*28:26.420- 28:33.020* :  separating the man from the artist. I don't agree anymore, but unfortunately the most vocal
*28:33.020- 28:35.240* :  people tend to be the one who doesn't agree.
*28:35.760- 28:39.980* :  Ludin, one of the co-authors of a petition to stop a Paris metro station being named after
*28:39.980- 28:46.120* :  Serge Gensborg. Next to a breakthrough in English football and Rebecca Welch is to become the first
*28:46.120- 28:51.740* :  woman to referee a premier league match, she'll take charge of the full and burn league clash on
*28:51.740- 28:58.020* :  the 23rd of December. A few days later, Sam Allison will be the league's first black referee for
*28:58.020- 29:04.380* :  15 years. Simon Stone has the details. Rebecca Welch is an experienced referee.
*29:05.300- 29:10.460* :  The atmosphere of a premier league stadium will be familiar to her that she walks out to the
*29:10.460- 29:16.920* :  center circle at Craven Cottage on the Saturday before Christmas. She was a fourth official at
*29:16.920- 29:22.460* :  a top flight game last month and was the first woman to take charge of an English football league match.
*29:23.140- 29:29.320* :  She was also at the Women's World Cup this summer. English football's head of refereeing Howard
*29:29.660- 29:37.460* :  told me she has the experience of big games and was the leading light in a strong field of female
*29:37.460- 29:41.860* :  officials. We're really confident that she would deliver a game in the Premier League and
*29:41.860- 29:46.980* :  obviously be a really good role model for women and girls who maybe might think refereeing
*29:46.980- 29:51.220* :  for them as well when previously they didn't. It's about quality people having an opportunity
*29:51.220- 29:57.680* :  to guard us of your background. Howard Webb had another announcement. Some Allison will be in charge
*29:57.680- 30:03.760* :  of Sheffield United against Luton on Boxing Day, the first black referee of a premier league match
*30:04.140- 30:10.580* :  since she rye runny retired from officiating the top divisions in 2009. Simon Stone.
*30:11.480- 30:17.100* :  Dr Chi is a Zimbabwean music producer based in Los Angeles. He was recently nominated for a
*30:17.100- 30:21.860* :  Grammy in the Latin category. He's also doing well as a recording artist in his own right.
*30:21.860- 30:27.640* :  Speaking to DJ Edu on the World Services, this is Africa. He explained how his success really
*30:27.640- 30:32.200* :  started when the Jamaican superstar Sean Paul decided to record one of his songs.
*30:47.460- 30:51.700* :  I've been here for six years now and at the time the dream was to move to LA to become
*30:51.700- 30:56.960* :  a music producer and to write songs and produce for all these artists and so when I graduated
*30:57.780- 31:03.020* :  I said my mom did. My friends said I could go to LA and try this out. You know African parents
*31:03.020- 31:10.720* :  there's always a deal. There's always a hustle and so for me my deal was you know because I always
*31:10.720- 31:16.340* :  made beats when I was in school and so my parents looked at me and they said okay look we know
*31:16.340- 31:21.460* :  you love the music thing. For the first three months of you going out to LA will support you
*31:21.960- 31:27.920* :  and if it works out after three months you stay if it doesn't work out you come home and you do
*31:27.920- 31:33.200* :  your 95 and you go do your life in advertising and so I think it was the last two weeks of that
*31:33.200- 31:38.740* :  three months when I got the call that Sean Paul would be recording the song so a very very
*31:38.920- 31:41.140* :  special time and a deal I'll never forget.
*31:52.140- 31:58.680* :  You are now a Grammy-nominated producer via Latin Routes. How does that feel?
*31:59.700- 32:03.560* :  It feels phenomenal you know I think I need to start learning Spanish one of these days.
*32:12.480- 32:18.040* :  So I've been nominated for the Latin Grammys twice now. The first time was a song called
*32:18.620- 32:22.340* :  Hay Ma by Pitbull, Jay Bolvin and Camila Cabello.
*32:25.020- 32:32.080* :  This year I've nominated for an album by Luis Figueroa. The category is best salsa album.
*32:40.340- 32:44.140* :  What I love about Latin Americans is that you know they're really really
*32:44.140- 32:49.000* :  are connected even with their African roots and so there's a lot of similarities between
*32:49.000- 32:54.600* :  Africans and Latin Americans in a way where even sometimes you won't be speaking the same language
*32:54.660- 32:57.460* :  but you're like I feel like I understand what this guy is saying.
