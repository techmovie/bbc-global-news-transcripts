*01:16.700- 01:19.240* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:21.720- 01:25.640* :  I'm Nick Mars and in the early hours of Sunday the 10th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:26.160- 01:30.640* :  The United Nations has warned that nine out of ten people in Gaza can't eat every day and that
*01:30.640- 01:36.820* :  half the population is starving. Rwanda has criticized the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo
*01:37.340- 01:43.360* :  for comparing his Rwanda counterpart to Adolf Hitler. Iran has prevented the family of
*01:43.360- 01:49.700* :  Mahsa Amani whose death in custody led to mass protests from collecting a major human rights
*01:49.700- 01:57.780* :  award in France. Also in this podcast we learn why a close cousin of T-Rex was a fussy eater.
*01:57.980- 02:03.660* :  It didn't eat the rest of the carcasses of these two prey items. Only the hind legs were eaten.
*02:07.480- 02:12.480* :  Almost every day now we've been reporting on the impact of the war in Gaza on the people there.
*02:13.240- 02:17.920* :  Nine weeks after the conflict began, the BBC has spoken to a senior member of the UN
*02:17.920- 02:23.360* :  who's seen the situation on the ground. His Carl Skow, a deputy director of the World Food
*02:23.360- 02:27.600* :  Programme, he's been in Raffa, a city in the south of the strip and he's been painting a
*02:27.600- 02:32.920* :  bleak picture of what he found. I met people who had not eaten for days. The survey that we managed
*02:32.920- 02:38.680* :  to do during the humanitarian pause shows that half the population is starving. People are not
*02:38.680- 02:43.500* :  getting enough to eat. They're not eating at all or they're eating once a day and they don't
*02:43.500- 02:48.440* :  know they don't know where the next meal is going to come from. You know there is no food whatsoever
*02:48.440- 02:53.960* :  in the shops. We went to a few supermarkets. There are completely empty of food. There is some
*02:53.960- 03:01.280* :  shampoo maybe but that's it. We have only been able to get some 10% of the food needed in Gaza
*03:01.740- 03:08.000* :  in since the start of the war. So the situation is increasingly desperate and you can feel it
*03:08.000- 03:13.500* :  when you are at the distribution sites where we distribute food and flower. People are angry.
*03:13.500- 03:18.880* :  People are frustrated and they're desperate. And let's hear now from two people living in Gaza.
*03:18.880- 03:26.060* :  First a man in the north of the strip. We were displaced from an area in the north. We are
*03:26.060- 03:32.240* :  staying in tents made out of nylon. We don't have any blankets for me and my wife and children
*03:32.240- 03:38.180* :  to cover ourselves with. Regarding food, there is no food and no one brings food and the prices
*03:38.180- 03:43.920* :  here are very high. One can only have one meal a day and god knows if there are people who go on
*03:43.920- 03:49.880* :  with their day with no meal at all. This woman said she'd been displaced by the fighting 11 times.
*03:51.860- 03:56.580* :  We don't eat anything but plain bread and we tell each other to eat only a quarter of the bread
*03:57.000- 04:02.000* :  so the bag doesn't finish and look for more bread. Kids tell us we want food. We want food.
*04:02.600- 04:05.140* :  So we give it to them. We the adults can manage.
*04:06.120- 04:12.940* :  According to new figures from the Hamas run health authority, 17,700 people died in Gaza
*04:12.940- 04:18.540* :  since the conflict began. Israel insists its military response to the blood vessel by Hamas
*04:18.540- 04:25.700* :  on the 7th of October is proportionate to the threat. Israeli media reports say at least 420
*04:25.700- 04:30.520* :  Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of the war. Our correspondent Paul Adams sent
*04:30.520- 04:39.140* :  this report from Jerusalem. The scenes inside the NASA hospital in Han Unis are hard to watch.
*04:39.140- 04:44.200* :  Patients, men and children are being treated on the floor. It's desperately crowded.
*04:44.640- 04:49.060* :  The children look stunned. The hospital is overwhelmed. The doctors in despair.
*04:49.880- 04:53.260* :  Ahmed Mograbi is head of plastic surgery and the burns unit.
*04:53.500- 04:58.540* :  Actually, I'm, I'm helpless today. I shouldn't. All families came to me. Please,
*04:58.540- 05:04.280* :  operate on my son, operate on my brother. So I couldn't help them because I don't have any
*05:04.280- 05:10.520* :  season doctor. I can't open the operative room without any season drugs. So I don't know how to
*05:10.960- 05:11.460* :  help my people.
*05:15.380- 05:19.240* :  In the Jabalya refugee camp in the north where street battles are still raging,
*05:19.240- 05:24.720* :  fresh graves are prepared in the sandy soil of an alleyway between two shuttered shops.
*05:24.720- 05:30.620* :  The camp is surrounded. No aid is getting in. Israel calls this a Hamas stronghold.
*05:30.620- 05:35.840* :  One of several it's trying to control. Colonel Richard Hecht is a spokesman for the army.
*05:36.000- 05:42.660* :  This is a long war. This is a complicated war. As we speak, there's a special forces working
*05:42.660- 05:48.600* :  in the south in a very, very complex battlefield and also in the north in the Sahjaya and Jabalya,
*05:48.600- 05:52.340* :  a ticking care of this infrastructure that I must have been building for years.
*05:53.100- 05:58.360* :  How much longer will this long complicated war last? Israel knows the clock is ticking.
*05:58.360- 06:02.400* :  Their American allies may have vetoed a ceasefire resolution at the UN,
*06:02.400- 06:06.860* :  but the Biden administration is beginning to sound impatient. Like Israel,
*06:06.860- 06:11.400* :  Washington does not want Hamas to survive as a military force when this is over,
*06:11.980- 06:15.160* :  but it does want the Gaza Strip to survive as a place to live.
*06:15.160- 06:18.720* :  And right now it's teetering on the edge of total collapse.
*06:18.720- 06:22.920* :  The World Food Programme says half the population is facing starvation,
*06:22.920- 06:28.640* :  and the charity save the children says thousands under the age of five are so malnourished
*06:28.640- 06:31.520* :  they need urgent medical treatment to avoid death.
*06:32.340- 06:37.460* :  Paul Adams reporting. After that veto of the UN resolution by the US on Friday,
*06:37.460- 06:42.920* :  the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has accused Washington of being complicit in war crimes.
*06:42.920- 06:47.940* :  He said he now held the US responsible for the bloodshed of Palestinian children,
*06:47.940- 06:51.520* :  women and the elderly in Israel's attacks on Gaza.
*06:52.860- 06:57.980* :  The family of Masa Amani, the Iranian Kurdish woman whose death in custody last year
*06:58.220- 07:03.620* :  led to nationwide protests in Iran, have been banned from traveling to France to collect
*07:03.620- 07:08.860* :  a top human rights prize in her honour. On Middle East regional editor Mike Thomson reports.
*07:09.560- 07:13.460* :  The Iranian authorities have long had a problem with Masa Amani's family,
*07:13.460- 07:19.060* :  who've insisted she was killed when in custody, despite official claims that she died of an
*07:19.060- 07:24.960* :  undisclosed medical condition. So when Miss Amani's parents and brother prepared to board their
*07:24.960- 07:29.860* :  flight to France at Tehran Airport, they were stopped and their passports confiscated.
*07:29.860- 07:35.480* :  They were to be presented with the European Union's Sacker of Prize, awarded posthumously to
*07:35.480- 07:40.500* :  Masa Amani for freedom of thought and her role in triggering the woman life freedom movement.
*07:40.500- 07:46.340* :  The prize set up to honour the promotion of human rights and freedoms will be awarded in Strasbourg.
*07:47.140- 07:47.820* :  Mike Thomson
*07:49.020- 07:55.100* :  Ukraine's first lady, Olehna Zelenska, has warned that Ukrainians will be left to die without
*07:55.100- 08:00.660* :  more support from Western countries. Speaking to the BBC from Kiev, hours after a Russian
*08:00.660- 08:06.660* :  missile attack, Olehna Zelenska said her country could be in mortal danger because of funding delays.
*08:06.700- 08:13.120* :  She said it hurt to see help fading. The first lady was talking to our correspondent Laura Koonsberg.
*08:13.500- 08:18.380* :  Nearly two years since the war began and her family's life was turned upside down,
*08:19.180- 08:25.560* :  Olehna Zelenska's concerns were simple and stark. We really need the help she told me.
*08:26.500- 08:32.780* :  We cannot get tired of this situation. If we do, we die. But if the world gets tired,
*08:32.780- 08:39.040* :  they will simply let us die, she said. Fears seem to rise here in Ukraine.
*08:39.980- 08:45.920* :  That the West's early fervor for its cause is fading, just when it's needed the most.
*08:46.500- 08:47.280* :  Laura Koonsberg
*08:48.340- 08:54.400* :  The last meal of a 75 million year old tyrannosaur has been revealed by scientists
*08:55.040- 09:01.220* :  behind legs of two baby dinosaurs. Well scientists at the dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta,
*09:01.220- 09:06.440* :  Canada say the preservation of the animal and of the small unfortunate creatures inside it
*09:06.440- 09:12.240* :  shines new light on how these giant predators lived and ate. Our science correspondent Victoria
*09:12.240- 09:17.740* :  Gill reports. This young Gorgosaurus, a large tyrannosaur and a close cousin of T-Rex, has been
*09:17.740- 09:24.020* :  preserved for 75 million years with its last meal fossilized in its gut. Experts at Canada's Royal
*09:24.020- 09:29.400* :  Museum of Paleontology, where the fossils have been studied, noticed small toe bones poking
*09:29.400- 09:34.380* :  through its ribs. Closer examination and more careful preparation revealed that these were
*09:34.380- 09:40.100* :  actually two sets of hind legs belonging to two baby bird-like dinosaurs called Chitapas.
*09:40.720- 09:45.840* :  One of the lead researchers, Dr. Dala Zelenski, says this is a unique insight into how juvenile
*09:45.840- 09:51.720* :  tyrannosaurs could have hunted. I think what was really interesting about this teenage Gorgosaurus,
*09:51.740- 09:59.420* :  if any of us have teenagers out there, it seems to be a very particular eater. It didn't eat
*09:59.740- 10:04.380* :  the rest of the carcasses of these two prey items, only the hind legs were eaten.
*10:05.300- 10:11.480* :  So this teenage Gorgosaurus seems to have had an appetite for drumsticks of this Chitapas.
*10:11.920- 10:17.240* :  The scientists say the fossil is a glimpse of how dramatically tyrannosaurs changed as they grew
*10:17.240- 10:22.420* :  from slender agile hunters that chased small prey and bit through them to the
*10:22.460- 10:27.260* :  burly, powerful animals whose jaws were able to crush the bones of larger dinosaurs.
*10:30.960- 10:37.060* :  Still to come, the calm composed reporter on the world of high-priced movie merchandise.
*10:37.520- 10:42.040* :  I'm never going to get this close to a rocket firing bobbah fat again in my life.
*10:42.740- 10:49.680* :  Look at it, you can hold it if you want. Wow, may the force be with him.

*12:08.560- 12:10.260* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast.
*12:11.000- 12:14.720* :  The years Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have been
*12:14.720- 12:19.240* :  vying for control and influence in the eastern part of the DRC.
*12:19.780- 12:23.900* :  Well now Rwanda has criticised the DRC for comparing the Rwanda President,
*12:23.900- 12:29.500* :  Paul Gagami, to Adolf Hitler, and accusing him of having expansionist aims.
*12:29.500- 12:33.700* :  Our Africa regional editor, Will Ross, told me how Rwanda has responded.
*12:34.140- 12:39.480* :  A Rwanda government spokesperson has described this as what she called a
*12:39.580- 12:47.140* :  clear and loud threat by the Congolese President, and that she then went on to talk about
*12:47.140- 12:52.340* :  some of the context, the problems going on in eastern Congo at the moment, and she referred to
*12:53.040- 12:58.880* :  Hutu Rebels, who she said were more armed than ever, and she also talked about
*12:58.880- 13:04.000* :  ethnic cleansing of Congolese tutsis inside eastern Congo.
*13:04.260- 13:10.960* :  And what this shows is that they're keen to reply to this allegation from Felix Chesaquiti,
*13:10.960- 13:15.700* :  that the Rwanda government, or Paul Gagami in particular, is expansionist.
*13:15.760- 13:18.480* :  And that's why he made this comparison to Adolf Hitler.
*13:18.840- 13:23.460* :  Because for years, the Congolese President has accused the Rwanda military
*13:24.120- 13:30.060* :  of intervening militarily inside eastern Congo, and of course Rwanda has played a role in
*13:31.200- 13:35.540* :  wars that have seen governments change in Congo. So there is history there.
*13:36.320- 13:41.880* :  And at the moment, there's this dreadful conflict going on in eastern Congo involving the M23
*13:41.880- 13:48.920* :  rebel group, which many reports have shown Rwanda is backing, even though Cagali denies that.
*13:49.480- 13:55.200* :  Will Ross. It is 75 years since the world united around a ground-breaking document,
*13:55.200- 14:00.460* :  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Born out of the horrors of the Second World War,
*14:00.460- 14:06.920* :  the Declaration aspired to ensure that all human beings were born free and equal in dignity,
*14:06.920- 14:11.140* :  regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, religion, or anything else.
*14:11.700- 14:14.940* :  So how is that aim working out 75 years on?
*14:15.380- 14:20.200* :  And Geneva correspondent Imogen Fokes has been talking to some of those who've led the
*14:20.200- 14:22.580* :  United Nations human rights work over the years.
*14:29.520- 14:35.280* :  It was the world's never-again moment. A charter agreed by 192 countries,
*14:35.340- 14:41.560* :  guaranteeing fundamental freedoms to all, the right to life, to freedom of expression,
*14:41.580- 14:47.460* :  the right not to be tortured. You came from another planet and just looked at the human rights
*14:47.460- 14:52.660* :  framework, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all that the treaties, the conventions,
*14:52.660- 14:57.320* :  you think you've arrived in heaven? Why is it not the case?
*14:58.740- 15:04.260* :  Representing almost 2,000 million people, they came with hope, born of common struggle.
*15:04.940- 15:09.960* :  Louise Arbor, you in human rights chief from 2004 until 2008?
*15:10.820- 15:18.520* :  knows the promises made in 1948 are often not kept. Falkerturk, currently in the job, agrees.
*15:19.140- 15:25.540* :  I am very much concerned that we lose the essence of what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
*15:26.500- 15:33.680* :  was and was meant to be in response to cataclysmic events during the Second World War.
*15:33.740- 15:38.340* :  I hereby declare open the 35th meeting of the Human Rights Council.
*15:39.120- 15:45.300* :  75 years on, you in human rights sits atop a vast array of committees and experts.
*15:46.020- 15:52.460* :  Their job to scrutinise countries on their records, on poverty, housing, the right to food,
*15:52.460- 15:58.700* :  the rights of women. There are whole teams looking at crisis regions. They gather evidence,
*15:58.780- 16:05.080* :  often of horrific violations, including war crimes. But reminds Louise Arbor,
*16:05.080- 16:11.620* :  they can't prosecute only publish. I think that's part of the dilemma. How do you use your voice?
*16:11.660- 16:19.160* :  I think to be the megaphone or the denunciation of injustices, at some point becomes counterproductive.
*16:19.320- 16:25.740* :  It just illuminates how impotent the system is. It's like you scream in the wilderness.
*16:26.220- 16:29.920* :  Russia bombed it. A war crime you an investigator say.
*16:30.040- 16:35.000* :  Emissioned by the UN, it says the UK government's welfare policies have had tragic consequences.
*16:35.380- 16:41.020* :  But even if it is just screaming no country, whether it's Russia over war crimes in Ukraine,
*16:41.020- 16:46.560* :  or the United Kingdom over child poverty, wants a negative report from the UN.
*16:46.560- 16:53.800* :  Zadrad al-Hussein, human rights chief until 2018, believes the UN shouldn't flinch from
*16:53.800- 16:59.860* :  disapproval, even from the most powerful. I knew from my experience in the former Yugoslavia
*16:59.860- 17:05.960* :  that if the UN believed that it's in the friend's business, it produces catastrophic results.
*17:05.980- 17:10.700* :  The UN is not there to become friendly with the member states. Would you allow U.S.
*17:10.700- 17:13.820* :  interrogators to water board terrorist prisoners? Absolutely.
*17:15.020- 17:17.740* :  Torture works. Okay, folks. Believe me, it works. Okay.
*17:17.840- 17:23.600* :  And so when Donald Trump, on the campaign trail in 2016, argued in favor of torture,
*17:24.260- 17:30.660* :  Zad didn't hesitate. Someone asked me about Donald Trump and I said, yes, I think he's dangerous.
*17:31.300- 17:33.120* :  I mean, how could you not think that?
*17:33.200- 17:36.780* :  The non-star flood of migrants stretching resources to the map.
*17:36.900- 17:41.240* :  The numbers using small boats to cross the narrow but deadly stretch of water between
*17:42.480- 17:48.500* :  and less developed countries, sometimes struggling with conflict, can be irritated by what they
*17:48.500- 17:54.160* :  see as double standards from the wealthy West. But Louise Arbor, think they have a point.
*17:54.160- 17:59.780* :  The West were always in a position of asking others to do something that was hard for them to do.
*18:00.220- 18:04.880* :  But when it came a time where the West was asked to do something that was hard for it to do,
*18:04.960- 18:14.200* :  it choked. And I think the post 9-11 world showed how the U.S. was very quick to even reconsider
*18:14.200- 18:19.960* :  fundamental norms like the absolute prohibition on torture. And now if we look at the entire migration
*18:20.060- 18:25.240* :  agenda, when Europe and America are asked to do something that's hard for them to do this time,
*18:25.240- 18:30.240* :  there are nowhere to be seen. So is there anything to celebrate on this 75th anniversary?
*18:30.300- 18:36.040* :  It's easy to dismiss the UN as an ineffective and yet interfering nuisance,
*18:36.040- 18:43.280* :  but its human rights standards only exist because 75 years ago the same member states who
*18:43.280- 18:48.020* :  criticise them now were determined to make things better for all of us.
*18:48.420- 18:54.860* :  That report by Imogen folks in Geneva. EU officials have reached a deal on the world's first
*18:54.860- 19:00.220* :  comprehensive laws to regulate artificial intelligence. Britain, the United States and China
*19:00.500- 19:03.420* :  are working on similar proposals. Tom Jusbury reports.
*19:03.940- 19:08.820* :  After 36 hours of talks in Brussels, an agreement was reached on how Europe should respond to the
*19:08.820- 19:13.780* :  use of AI. The discussions focused on areas such as the police's use of facial recognition
*19:13.780- 19:19.660* :  and as generative AI like the chatbot chatGPT. The proposals include safeguards on the use of
*19:19.660- 19:24.100* :  artificial intelligence within the EU, which become more stringent based on how big of an impact
*19:24.100- 19:28.220* :  the tech could have. Fines could be imposed on companies for failing to follow the rules.
*19:29.000- 19:32.960* :  To become law, it needs to pass a vote in the EU's parliament early next year.
*19:33.300- 19:36.440* :  If it does, the guidelines could be enforced as early as 2025.
*19:37.460- 19:38.200* :  Tom Jusbury
*19:39.140- 19:43.040* :  When Star Wars first came to cinemas screens in the late 1970s,
*19:43.240- 19:47.900* :  it not only ushered in the era of the space blockbuster but was also the start of a whole
*19:47.900- 19:53.700* :  merchandise industry. More than 40 years on, the original toys had become highly sought after.
*19:53.700- 19:59.840* :  Summary and fetching a few hundred thousand dollars. BBC Business Reporter and Star Wars
*19:59.840- 20:06.440* :  Superfan Rowan Bridge has been to one of the biggest toy fairs dedicated to that film franchise.
*20:09.640- 20:14.260* :  Welcome to Echo Base Live, the largest vintage Star Wars toy fair in the UK,
*20:14.820- 20:17.740* :  where people like me come to buy back our childhood memories.
*20:18.420- 20:24.040* :  For a summer, me and my friends were just on Tatooine with all of our little jowers and
*20:24.340- 20:28.560* :  you know, running down a hill with my Millennium Falcon, you know, it's just an amazing,
*20:28.560- 20:34.020* :  a delicate childhood. Takes me back to simpler times. Me and my brother love it.
*20:34.180- 20:35.860* :  It was the only thing we really connected with.
*20:36.040- 20:41.720* :  In 1977, when Star Wars burst onto the big screen, it helped launch the modern era of movie
*20:41.840- 20:42.320* :  merchandise.
*20:47.560- 20:51.940* :  Those figures and play sets that once sold for a few dollars can now go for prices that
*20:51.940- 20:57.780* :  seem out of this world and the rarer the peaks, the greater the value. At the centre of the toy fair
*20:57.780- 21:02.380* :  in a protective case and specially lit is the holy grail of Star Wars collecting,
*21:02.380- 21:07.760* :  a prototype, Bobba Fett figure. The first voice you're about to hear is my colleague Steve,
*21:07.760- 21:15.100* :  asking why I'm taking a picture of it. I'm taking a photo of Bobba Fett. I get to see this thing
*21:15.340- 21:19.820* :  one similar lifetime. It's the only chance I'm ever going to, I'm never going to get this close
*21:20.440- 21:24.920* :  to a rocket firing Bobba Fett again in my life. Look at it, you can hold it if you want.
*21:28.600- 21:34.060* :  Wow. As you might have gathered, I was rather excited. The figure itself is owned by a collector
*21:34.060- 21:39.340* :  Martin Skullfield. There's probably 120 of these in the world. They didn't release to the
*21:39.340- 21:43.900* :  public because there was a choking hazard. We'd estimate that there's anywhere between £150,000
*21:43.900- 21:48.460* :  for a piece of plastic. For a little bit of plastic, yeah. To understand how we ended up here,
*21:48.460- 21:55.580* :  take a trip with me back to the 1970s. When Star Wars came out, movie merchandising existed,
*21:55.580- 21:59.800* :  but nothing like the scale of today. And what turned out to be a lucrative move,
*21:59.800- 22:04.820* :  the film's director, George Lucas, took a lower fee for the film in order to hold onto the
*22:04.820- 22:10.420* :  merch rights effectively, the right to put Star Wars on everything from serial packets to plastic toys.
*22:11.000- 22:15.340* :  Tim Efflet was part of the team at the toy makers, Kenner, that worked on Star Wars.
*22:15.620- 22:21.580* :  There is so many of the elements that made it natural for a toy line. You had these fantastic
*22:21.580- 22:27.300* :  vehicles. You had villains and heroes that were easy to execute and present in toy form.
*22:27.560- 22:31.800* :  And I think that really got us excited about it. And the story was really straightforward,
*22:31.800- 22:36.540* :  easy to follow for the most part. It was really designed for kids almost, you know.
*22:36.820- 22:40.780* :  Now those kids like me, who first played with the toys in the 70s and 80s,
*22:40.780- 22:45.860* :  are grown men and women, men and women who were old enough to have the cash to buy back the figures
*22:45.860- 22:50.500* :  they once played with and discard it. The older you get, you know, you've paired off your
*22:50.500- 22:55.720* :  mortgage, your kids have moved out, you've got excess money. Nick Dykes is a Star Wars specialist
*22:55.720- 23:01.720* :  at the UK Auction House Fectis and Demand to drive up the prices. So if you've got a few people
*23:01.720- 23:06.960* :  that are looking for the same thing, if you've got that thing, you can charge what you want really
*23:06.960- 23:11.820* :  within reason. Being a Mandalorian is not just learning about how to fight.
*23:12.220- 23:16.100* :  The value of Star Wars and its merchandise and hasn't been lost on Disney,
*23:16.100- 23:20.960* :  and now own the franchise, they've been busy producing new films and TV projects
*23:21.480- 23:24.620* :  like this trailer for the Disney Plus series, the Mandalorian.
*23:25.060- 23:25.920* :  This is the way.
*23:27.780- 23:32.080* :  These shows are introducing the next generation of fans to the Star Wars universe,
