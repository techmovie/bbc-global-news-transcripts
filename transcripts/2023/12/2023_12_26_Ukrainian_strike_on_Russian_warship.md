*01:14.320- 01:17.200* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:20.300- 01:26.520* :  I'm Janet Chalille and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 26th of December, these are our main stories.
*01:27.240- 01:31.620* :  Ukraine says it's destroyed a Russian naval ship in a port in occupied Crimea.
*01:34.000- 01:40.360* :  Pilots of the tactical Air Force delivered a strike. The warship was destroyed, most likely with
*01:40.360- 01:45.020* :  much ammunition on board. As Israel says it's carried out a hundred strikes on
*01:45.020- 01:49.860* :  Gaza in the past 24 hours. The UN describes the situation there as catastrophic.
*01:50.640- 01:56.660* :  Children lying on the floor wounded with doctors that have no time or supplies to help them.
*01:59.780- 02:05.040* :  Also in this podcast we find out about some unusual celebrations of Christmas across the world.
*02:05.660- 02:11.200* :  On Christmas Day it's particularly sociable and fun. It's an old tradition and it's been going on
*02:11.200- 02:20.320* :  for more than 40 years. Russia has acknowledged that one of its naval landing
*02:20.320- 02:26.460* :  ships was hit by Ukrainian cruise missile while docked in the occupied Crimea and port of Fero-Dosia.
*02:27.000- 02:31.380* :  Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky joked on social media that the vessel had now
*02:31.380- 02:37.980* :  joined Moscow's underwater black sea fleet, a reference to other Russian ships sunk during the war.
*02:38.560- 02:42.060* :  A Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat described the attack.
*02:43.980- 02:50.000* :  Pilots of the tactical Air Force delivered a strike. The operation was planned by the armed
*02:50.000- 02:55.960* :  forces and other security branches. The footage that is shown is indeed impressive.
*02:56.700- 03:00.680* :  The warship was destroyed, most likely with much ammunition on board.
*03:01.020- 03:05.740* :  If we get information about the type of ammunition, we'll announce that later.
*03:07.700- 03:11.800* :  The Russian installed authorities in Crimea said one person was killed in the assault
*03:11.800- 03:17.120* :  and several others wounded. Are Ukraine correspondent James Woodhouse gave us his assessment
*03:17.120- 03:23.040* :  of the attack? It is significant in the sense that Ukraine can still navigate Russian air
*03:23.040- 03:30.700* :  defenses and strike in the heart of a peninsula that Russia has held so tightly onto since 2014.
*03:30.700- 03:37.620* :  Now the novel Cherkask was in port in Fero-Dosia suggesting that it was probably being loaded with
*03:37.620- 03:44.280* :  men, equipment or both. Now this is a is a major vessel. It's enormous and it will no doubt
*03:44.280- 03:50.920* :  hamper Russia's ability to supply troops further north in Ukrainian territory. It occupies.
*03:50.920- 03:57.260* :  What is less clear is for how long operations will be disrupted. We've seen Ukraine launch
*03:57.260- 04:02.960* :  long-range missiles over the past year to great effect for Kiev. It's undermined Russia's
*04:02.960- 04:07.680* :  presence there and it's also frustrated supply lines. There is no doubt that Russia's navy,
*04:07.680- 04:13.180* :  the dominance it enjoys in the Black Sea and off the coast of Crimea.
*04:13.660- 04:17.960* :  That has been weakened slightly with these long-range missile strikes to the extent that some
*04:17.960- 04:25.660* :  ports are no longer completely blockaded. But I don't think that we are going to see it influence
*04:25.660- 04:31.980* :  the front lines immediately, which Ukraine would so dearly want to happen. Russia has not only
*04:31.980- 04:37.020* :  held on to the 5th of Ukrainian territory it occupies, but it's attacking as well in some areas.
*04:37.020- 04:41.360* :  But this is much needed good news for Kiev against the backdrop of waning western support.
*04:42.660- 04:43.380* :  James Waterhouse
*04:44.520- 04:49.540* :  Israel says it's launched air strikes on a hundred targets over the past 24 hours.
*04:49.900- 04:54.380* :  After its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to expand the war in Gaza.
*04:55.060- 05:00.660* :  Aid workers have described catastrophic scenes in a conflict that's already claimed the lives of
*05:00.660- 05:07.720* :  1% of Gaza's entire population, more than 20,000 people, mostly children and women.
*05:08.300- 05:13.400* :  A spokesperson for UNICEF Tess Ingram shared the findings of her colleague who visited the
*05:13.400- 05:18.420* :  Schiffer hospital in northern Gaza. They saw horrors there beyond anything they'd seen in
*05:18.760- 05:24.040* :  in their entire career as an emergencies professional. They told me stories about
*05:24.580- 05:30.740* :  children lying on the floor wounded with doctors that have no time or supplies to help them
*05:31.280- 05:37.220* :  of about I think 50,000 internally displaced people using that hospital as a shelter.
*05:37.860- 05:44.940* :  And one harrowing story of a 17-year-old girl who had her leg amputated without any anesthesia.
*05:46.020- 05:51.760* :  Mr Netanyahu is under pressure from the U.S. to scale down the offensive and also domestically
*05:52.100- 05:55.660* :  as concern grows about the mounting number of Israeli soldiers killed
*05:56.200- 05:59.440* :  and the families of hostages accuse him of ignoring their plight.
*06:00.120- 06:04.060* :  And amid fears the conflict could spread across the region, the U.S. says it's carried out
*06:04.060- 06:10.040* :  air strikes against pro-Iranian militias based in Iraq in response to attacks on American
*06:10.040- 06:15.720* :  bases in the region. Our correspondent Shima Khalil is in Jerusalem and she began by telling me
*06:15.720- 06:21.460* :  more about the situation at Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals. The UN official has described how
*06:21.460- 06:27.880* :  overloaded overstretched these hospitals are. She went on to say that casualties kept coming in,
*06:27.880- 06:32.480* :  injured people, some of them severely injured. They were waiting to be treated, some waiting in
*06:32.480- 06:38.720* :  cues, because there just wasn't enough room and there wasn't enough capacity for them to be treated.
*06:38.720- 06:42.140* :  And I think that really tallies with what the UN has been saying for a very long time,
*06:42.140- 06:47.540* :  that hospitals in Gaza, most hospitals in Gaza are incredibly overwhelmed. Remember,
*06:47.540- 06:54.440* :  they're suffering from no fuel, no water, very, very limited supplies. We've had the WHO saying
*06:54.440- 07:01.020* :  that Northern Gaza has no functional hospital. And now we're getting into a situation in central
*07:01.020- 07:06.500* :  Gaza where about 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate. We know that there's an expansion
*07:06.500- 07:11.480* :  of the military operation in this area. We have this air strike that has destroyed a residential
*07:11.480- 07:16.780* :  block. People still being pulled out of the rubble. And then you get the rhetoric from Benjamin
*07:16.780- 07:22.240* :  Netanyahu, which essentially says that these air strikes are going to keep happening. This military
*07:22.240- 07:28.320* :  operation is expanding. It's deepening and that it is nowhere near being finished.
*07:29.320- 07:34.900* :  And despite all these deaths, all this disruption and all this suffering in Gaza,
*07:35.500- 07:39.140* :  many in Israel are criticizing Mr. Netanyahu for what they say is a lack of
*07:39.240- 07:43.960* :  clear military success. And also the growing number of Israeli soldiers who are dying as well.
*07:44.600- 07:48.540* :  That's right. It's quite remarkable, really, to see him address the Knesset yesterday.
*07:48.540- 07:54.320* :  He is the Israeli parliament. He was again saying that the way to achieve success and to bring
*07:54.320- 08:00.320* :  back the hostages is to keep fighting. And you could hear families heckling him saying,
*08:00.320- 08:07.280* :  Ahshav, or now, which is their call for an immediate release of their loved ones. And we talk a lot
*08:07.280- 08:13.480* :  about domestic pressure on the Netanyahu government. You saw it play out in the Israeli parliament
*08:13.500- 08:19.460* :  with a clear anger from the families who say that whatever Israel doing militarily is not working
*08:19.460- 08:23.900* :  for them to bring their loved ones back because it's not bringing Hamas to the negotiating table.
*08:24.980- 08:29.980* :  And there have long been fears that the war in Gaza could spread to the wider region. And we're
*08:29.980- 08:36.360* :  hearing that the U.S. has carried out airstrikes in Iraq against pro-Iranian militias after attacks
*08:36.360- 08:42.140* :  on its forces. What connection is there to what's going on in Gaza? Oh, there's a clear connection.
*08:42.760- 08:50.240* :  Strikes against U.S. facilities both in Iraq and in Syria by Iran-affiliated militias,
*08:50.240- 08:56.720* :  especially Hezbollah, has really ramped up after the military incursion after October 7th.
*08:56.720- 09:01.380* :  And what we heard from the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is that they have targeted
*09:01.920- 09:08.720* :  three facilities that are used by Hezbollah militias and other affiliated operatives. This strike
*09:08.720- 09:15.680* :  on the air bill air base in Iraq has injured three U.S. personnel, I understand, and one seriously
*09:15.680- 09:21.660* :  injured. And I think what you're seeing here is the dilemma and the very difficult position
*09:21.660- 09:27.820* :  that the U.S. finds itself in because the war in Gaza is creating fault lines or is intensifying
*09:27.820- 09:33.500* :  fault lines that are already in very volatile areas of the world. The U.S. obviously has to
*09:33.500- 09:38.680* :  respond. It has to be a measured response. But at the same time, it's also trying to contain
*09:38.680- 09:42.800* :  the war in Gaza and trying to contain it from expanding elsewhere in the region.
*09:43.820- 09:49.240* :  Sharmicolil in Jerusalem. India says it's deploying three warships and reconnaissance aircraft
*09:49.240- 09:54.400* :  off its shores, following a recent spate of attacks on vessels. While most of these drone and missile
*09:54.400- 09:59.040* :  attacks have been in the Red Sea and carried out by Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen,
*09:59.100- 10:05.660* :  on Saturday, a tanker less than 400 kilometers off the coast of India was hit by a drone.
*10:06.320- 10:12.140* :  The U.S. accused Iran of carrying out that attack. The first time since the war in Gaza began
*10:12.220- 10:15.900* :  that Washington has said Tehran directly targeted a ship.
*10:16.140- 10:21.420* :  A South Asia regional editor, Ambrose and Etirajan in Delhi, told us more about why India had
*10:21.420- 10:26.900* :  decided to deploy these warships. It's sending a clear message to whoever was involved in this
*10:26.900- 10:33.900* :  previous drone attack on one of their tankers last week of the coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.
*10:34.080- 10:39.780* :  It is causing concern because it is one of the busiest shipping routes. And India depends on
*10:39.780- 10:45.740* :  a lot of oil from the Middle Eastern countries and the Saudi Arabia and Iraq are among the top
*10:45.740- 10:52.000* :  suppliers of oil to India. Now this attack has also triggered alarm among the global shipping
*10:52.000- 10:57.820* :  companies. So if this continues then that will disrupt supplies and many of the shipping companies
*10:58.500- 11:03.320* :  might want to avoid that particular route. And what has taken everyone by surprise was this
*11:03.320- 11:09.240* :  happened so close to the Indian coast about 400 kilometers. And what we witnessed was
*11:09.800- 11:14.940* :  the Houthi rebels were opposed to Israel's campaign in Gaza. They were attacking ships passing
*11:14.940- 11:21.280* :  through the Red Sea. That was 2000 kilometers away because they were targeting anyone with
*11:21.280- 11:24.900* :  the links to Israel. They were opposed to the war in Israel. So they were targeting most of the
*11:24.900- 11:30.060* :  ships with any links or sending out a clear message to the international community. But then
*11:30.660- 11:35.080* :  the attack has moved far away from that position and that is what is causing concern. So
*11:35.520- 11:40.860* :  India is sending these three guided missile destroyers with possible capability to look after
*11:41.360- 11:46.580* :  further drone attacks. But it is sending out a message because it's not clear who fired this drone,
*11:46.580- 11:52.020* :  the US blamed Iran and Iran refused saying that the acquisition was baseless, whether it was
*11:52.020- 11:57.200* :  launched from any country, land or from another ship or a boat. So that is the question that
*11:57.200- 12:03.640* :  Indian Navy wants to find out. So what is the concern now that this attack has happened so close
*12:03.640- 12:07.560* :  to India? It's not just India that's worried about this. Other countries in the region are as well.
*12:08.000- 12:13.060* :  Yes, following these attacks and Red Sea in the last one month or so, many of the global shipping
*12:13.060- 12:18.120* :  companies say they are diverting their ships changing the course. Instead of coming through Swiss
*12:18.120- 12:23.540* :  Canal into the Red Sea and then into Arabian Sea or Indian Ocean, now some of them have to take a
*12:23.540- 12:28.640* :  very circuitous route, going all the way around South Africa, keep up good hope and then reach
*12:28.640- 12:34.980* :  South Asia or even go far beyond. As a result, some of these companies are shipping cost have escalated.
*12:34.980- 12:39.580* :  For example, container cost have gone up as much as $1,500.
*12:40.820- 12:47.480* :  I'm Russan Etteragin in Delhi. The Amazon rainforest has been through the worst drought since records
*12:47.480- 12:53.280* :  began. In October, one of its main rivers recorded its lowest level in well over a century.
*12:53.520- 12:58.680* :  The dry weather has led to villages being cut off, the death of plants and wildlife and the
*12:58.680- 13:03.900* :  spread of wildfires. Scientists worry that this record drought means the Amazon is moving
*13:03.900- 13:10.040* :  faster towards its tipping point when the world's biggest rainforest will no longer be able to recover
*13:10.040- 13:16.080* :  and starts to break apart. The BBC's population correspondent Stephanie Higgity went to the Amazon
*13:16.500- 13:20.280* :  to visit one of the many communities affected deep in the rainforest.
*13:24.200- 13:33.280* :  We've been traveling along this river for nearly five hours now, every time the water gets too low,
*13:33.280- 13:40.260* :  we have to climb out of the boat, drag it through these really narrow stretches of river,
*13:41.880- 13:43.680* :  walk a bit and get back in when we can.
*13:49.960- 13:55.620* :  Olivera Tukuna is taking me to his village and the only way to get there is in a 10-foot
*13:55.620- 14:04.320* :  metal canoe. It's hot and it's exhausting. His community of 40 families is in the middle of
*14:04.320- 14:09.680* :  the Amazon. It's a five-hour journey from the nearest town, at least normally.
*14:19.260- 14:23.640* :  So what we're supposed to be a five-hour journey with five hours in now and we aren't even halfway,
*14:24.580- 14:25.640* :  we've decided to turn back.
*14:26.960- 14:37.140* :  We're very worried. If it gets worse than it is now, my family will be isolated there.
*14:37.880- 14:43.420* :  It's already happened. A relative fell ill and we were able to get him to the sitting time to
*14:43.420- 14:49.020* :  save him. Then there's a risk of snakes or alligators because you have to cross the lake
*14:49.020- 14:58.660* :  and it's much more dangerous than here. Over 100,000 people have been cut off by this route.
*14:59.800- 15:05.540* :  But scientists are worried that an ecological disaster is unfolding too and there are signs.
*15:06.160- 15:10.980* :  We are used to seeing dolphins for allicking in the lake babies and every beautiful
*15:11.020- 15:15.940* :  respects. We woke up and there were 20 carcasses along the shores.
*15:16.740- 15:22.460* :  Dr. Miriam Marmontel is a researcher at the Mamarawa Institute for sustainable development.
*15:22.740- 15:28.260* :  Scientists have been saying for years that this was going to happen to the Amazon in 2030,
*15:28.260- 15:34.360* :  2050, that we were going to be like Savannah, but I never expected to see it.
*15:35.540- 15:38.480* :  When we met in Quarry, a city in the middle of the rainforest,
*15:38.540- 15:45.300* :  the air was thick with smoke. Man-made fires burning out of control in a dry forest.
*15:46.900- 15:51.180* :  The fear is that the Amazon is racing towards a theoretical tipping point.
*15:51.960- 15:56.080* :  In the vast forest, water evaporates from the trees to form rain clouds,
*15:56.760- 16:01.360* :  so it feeds itself the water it needs to stay cool and sustain life.
*16:02.360- 16:06.480* :  If suites of a dye and the temperature rises beyond two degrees Celsius,
*16:07.400- 16:13.620* :  then the forest may not be able to keep doing that and it would keep dying in a catastrophic feedback loop.
*16:17.120- 16:24.960* :  So we have rain? Yes, finally. But perhaps not for long. Flavia Costa is a biologist at the
*16:24.960- 16:31.820* :  Brazilian National Institute for Amazon Research. We have seen very large mortality in the last
*16:31.820- 16:41.000* :  drought. When on average, the Amazon is spotted to function as a carbon sink and we mostly
*16:41.000- 16:49.680* :  expect the same now, which is sad. The Amazon stores around 120 billion metric tons of carbon.
*16:50.420- 16:57.160* :  We rely on it to help keep the planet cool. But with another dry year predicted next year,
*16:57.480- 17:01.160* :  the question is, how long will it be able to do that?
*17:02.880- 17:05.320* :  Stephanie Higgity reporting from the Amazon.
*17:08.860- 17:13.740* :  Still to come in this podcast, as only the second black football referee in the history of the
*17:13.740- 17:19.200* :  English Premier League takes to the field today, we hear from those battling for equal representation.
*17:19.960- 17:24.080* :  I started to notice certain things and hear certain things that would imply that
*17:24.540- 17:28.680* :  there was more at play here than just my ability to referee a game of football on the football field.
*17:35.060- 17:38.820* :  Do you ever pass someone in the street and wonder what's their story?
*17:38.960- 17:42.920* :  I was a very traumatized kid. Everything was about wanting to be long.
*17:43.120- 17:46.580* :  Lives less ordinary is the podcast where people share their experiences.
*17:46.880- 17:49.260* :  We beat the racists, but their dreams.
*17:49.680- 17:55.340* :  I wanted to see what would a shop for shot remake of Raiders of the Lost Ark with kids look like.
*17:55.580- 17:56.700* :  And their secrets.
*17:57.140- 17:58.340* :  I was almost a school shooter.
*17:58.980- 18:01.340* :  Unmissible stories from around the globe.
*18:01.980- 18:04.640* :  Lives less ordinary from the BBC World Service.
*18:05.520- 18:07.640* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*18:15.100- 18:20.060* :  Hey BBC listeners, you come to the global news podcast because you want to stay up to date on
*18:20.060- 18:26.200* :  the best of international coverage. I'm Erica Kruzkovara from KQED's The Bay podcast,
*18:26.420- 18:30.400* :  where we bring you the best of local news around the Bay area.
*18:31.200- 18:36.500* :  Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we bring you conversations with local journalists to give you
*18:36.500- 18:42.280* :  the context and analysis that you need to make sense of what's going on in our region.
*18:42.940- 18:45.880* :  You can find the bay wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:51.100- 18:52.800* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast.
*18:53.840- 18:57.920* :  There's been a great deal of concern over the past three weeks about the jailed Russian
*18:57.920- 19:02.160* :  dissident Alexei Navalny after he vanished without any explanation.
*19:02.880- 19:07.740* :  On Monday, it emerged that he'd been sent to a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle
*19:07.740- 19:14.560* :  in a security journey through Russia. But despite his isolation in the so-called polar wolf colony,
*19:14.560- 19:19.200* :  considered to be one of Russia's toughest prisons, in messages to his supporters,
*19:19.200- 19:24.440* :  he strikes an optimistic witty note, and he asks them not to worry about him.
*19:24.920- 19:27.640* :  Our Europe regional editor Paul Moss told us more.
*19:28.460- 19:32.760* :  In a short space, he goes through various sorts of message first, as you say.
*19:32.760- 19:38.440* :  He's rallying the troops. He, first of all, explains the executor's route, which he referred to
*19:38.440- 19:44.000* :  that got him to this very, very remote part of the Arctic north. And then he makes a joke.
*19:44.000- 19:47.840* :  I'm your new Santa Claus. I have a sheepskin coat and a fur hat.
*19:47.840- 19:51.080* :  And I'll soon have traditional Russian winter footwear.
*19:51.560- 19:55.520* :  Don't worry about me. He says, I'm fine. I'm totally relieved that I've made it.
*19:56.520- 20:00.520* :  Then another part of it is almost like a travel log that he's taking us through.
*20:00.520- 20:02.580* :  He describes where he is. There are no reindeer.
*20:03.260- 20:06.600* :  But there are a huge fluffy and very beautiful shepherd dogs, he says.
*20:06.600- 20:10.300* :  And I live above the Arctic Circle, near the village of Harp.
*20:10.680- 20:12.840* :  The nearest town has a beautiful name, he says.
*20:12.840- 20:18.940* :  Labi Tangini also describes seeing a convoy, which he says looks like something out of the movie,
*20:18.940- 20:25.060* :  an army convoy with machine guns, mittens, and felt boots, and then talks again about these fluffy dogs.
*20:26.040- 20:30.940* :  But then there is also a hint that things are not so ideal. He describes looking out. He says,
*20:30.940- 20:35.260* :  I see night, then evening, and then night again. A reference there to the fact you just don't get
*20:35.260- 20:40.180* :  much sunlight at this time of the year up in the Arctic. He says, I can't entertain you with stories
*20:40.180- 20:45.520* :  about polar exotics yet, because I haven't seen anything outside. I can only see the fence,
*20:45.520- 20:50.800* :  which is very close. And then finally he ends with, I think it's a joke, but it's sort of an odd joke.
*20:50.800- 20:54.460* :  He says, I'm Santa Claus, but I'm a special regime Santa Claus.
*20:55.080- 20:59.560* :  So only of those who behave very badly get presents. I think that's a reference to the idea that in
*21:00.180- 21:05.400* :  the rougher today, bad guys get rewarded. And there's a lot of concern about his well-being,
*21:05.400- 21:09.820* :  given that he survived an assassination attempt. Do we have any explanation as to why he disappeared?
*21:09.820- 21:14.480* :  And obviously, they'll be concerned about whether he can continue to contact his supporters.
*21:15.080- 21:19.620* :  When I've talked to some people in Russia, actually his disappearance wasn't too much as a surprise,
*21:19.620- 21:24.500* :  because they knew that he was going to be transferred to a harsher prison. He'd been warned of that,
*21:24.500- 21:30.320* :  and people tend to gather disappear from view while that happens. As for the messages, yeah, at the
*21:30.320- 21:35.120* :  moment, he's always communicated via Twitter by giving his lawyers messages, which are then
*21:35.120- 21:41.160* :  tweeted by the lawyers directly or by his supporters. But yes, the fact is he's now in a very remote
*21:41.160- 21:47.960* :  area. It's nearly 2,000 kilometers from Moscow. So it's an open question whether he will indeed be
*21:47.960- 21:52.460* :  able to see his lawyers and get these kind of tweets out to them. I should say one person told me
*21:52.460- 21:56.880* :  that you can get phones on the black market in these penal colonies. If you've got the money,
*21:57.380- 22:00.660* :  don't really know if that's going to be possible, but I guess we shall see.
*22:01.680- 22:08.240* :  Formos. Let's go to Mexico now. We're around 7,000 migrants, mainly from south and central
*22:08.240- 22:13.860* :  America, have begun an attempt to cross the US border. The caravan arrived in the southern
*22:13.860- 22:19.320* :  Mexican town of Alvaro, or very gone on Sunday and hit the road again on Monday in an attempt to
*22:19.320- 22:25.260* :  make it on foot to the shared US Mexico frontier. The procession has come just days before the US
*22:25.260- 22:30.820* :  Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, arrives in Mexico City to negotiate new agreements to control
*22:30.820- 22:36.740* :  the surge of migrants attempting to cross the border. Yongryo is a journalist based in Mexico City.
*22:36.740- 22:43.060* :  He's been speaking to Davina Gupta. This caravan of migrants, as they're referred to,
*22:43.520- 22:48.460* :  is now numbering over 6,000 people. There's different estimates of the exact number.
*22:49.220- 22:53.360* :  And it's coming from the south of Mexico, from the city of Tapa Chula,
*22:53.840- 23:00.380* :  gradually going north through Mexico. And it's a group of migrants and refugees from all over
*23:00.380- 23:06.000* :  the world, but particularly countries including Honduras, Cuba, and Haiti, but people as far as
*23:06.060- 23:12.180* :  Africa and India and beyond. And the reason they're done and they're organized by various NGOs
*23:12.180- 23:18.340* :  and migrant activists and advocates is to try and stop people being arrested. They're just going
*23:18.340- 23:23.760* :  through in very large numbers when you've got over 6,000 people. It's harder for the police to
*23:23.760- 23:28.720* :  just go and arrest everybody. Now, one thing about these is they're effective about certain people
*23:28.720- 23:34.820* :  going through Mexico. They don't actually represent the real high numbers of migrants. I mean, even
*23:34.820- 23:41.100* :  to 6,000 to 10,000 people on this march, but every day on the US-Mexico border, you're seeing,
*23:41.100- 23:46.780* :  in some days, 10,000 people being arrested. Are the children among those who are marching?
*23:47.380- 23:54.220* :  Yes. Amongst these high numbers of families, of children, you'll hear very severe stories of people
*23:54.220- 23:59.660* :  who have fled violence, who have fled extortion, who have fled kidnapping, who have fled political
*23:59.660- 24:03.760* :  persecution. Other times, I've seen people, situations where people have been like,
*24:04.200- 24:09.320* :  someone who's handicapped from being shot in the legs and had our family members carrying them.
*24:09.320- 24:14.920* :  People in very difficult situations, going hungry and often have been traveled for several months
*24:14.920- 24:18.780* :  on the road already. So what's the journey like ahead for them right now?
*24:19.380- 24:24.620* :  It's a difficult journey through Mexico. You have to go through sometimes. They can choose to jump
*24:24.620- 24:31.000* :  onto trains and risk the problem of falling off freight trains. Often it's going long times
*24:31.000- 24:35.760* :  walking until they're begging for food on the way and then risking if they're breaking off
*24:35.760- 24:41.060* :  of being arrested or being detained and sent back. But then the real difficulty will become
*24:41.720- 24:46.800* :  on the US-Mexico border. That's where they're going to see the issue of really trying to get into
*24:46.800- 24:51.580* :  the United States if they can manage to make it in. Another problem they've often faced,
*24:51.580- 24:56.320* :  and one of the reasons why these migrant caravans began in the first place was there was a lot of
*24:56.320- 25:02.100* :  mass kidnapping by the cartels here in Mexico. By the organized crime groups who were kidnapped,
*25:02.100- 25:06.860* :  people take them to ranches and then go to family members they had in the United States to get
*25:06.860- 25:11.280* :  them to send payments to release them. That's also something they can risk on the way though. The
*25:11.280- 25:16.740* :  thing is the idea is not such large numbers. It's much harder for the cartels to go and carry out
*25:16.740- 25:21.340* :  some kind of mass kidnapping. As you mentioned, it's difficult for authorities to crack down or
*25:21.340- 25:25.320* :  arrest people if they're marching in such large numbers. Why are they doing it now?
*25:25.900- 25:30.340* :  So I think for a lot of the people the ideas you have protection, a lot of them are waiting for a
*25:30.340- 25:35.380* :  very long time to try and get papers, transit papers to come through Mexico. They're being held
*25:35.380- 25:40.360* :  up. The system in Mexico is really being overwhelmed by the number of refugees and migrants.
*25:40.920- 25:47.200* :  But also in Mexico there's a kind of agreement between the Mexican President and the US President
*25:47.200- 25:52.380* :  Biden to attempt to slow down these migrants reaching the United States. So they're going through
*25:52.380- 25:56.400* :  in these large numbers to try and have protection from that reason for arrest,
*25:57.020- 25:59.720* :  but still they can still risk that kind of attention happening.
*26:00.760- 26:07.220* :  Young Rio, a journalist-based in Mexico City. As we record this podcast, a black referee is
*26:07.220- 26:13.200* :  preparing to take charge of an English Premier League football match for the first time in 15 years.
*26:13.880- 26:19.340* :  Sam Allison will officiate in Sheffield United's game against Lutentown. He's only the second
*26:19.340- 26:24.840* :  black referee in Premier League history. Our reporter, Nester McGregor, takes us through the long
*26:24.840- 26:32.000* :  journey and battle for representation in sport. Let me take you back to August 1997 when the back
*26:32.000- 26:38.640* :  street boys were number one, but maybe more importantly, Uriah already became top right Premier
*26:38.640- 26:44.260* :  League's first black referee. Rodney Hines is co-founder of the football black list. An organization
*26:44.460- 26:51.360* :  that celebrates black excellence in football. Sam Allison's appointment is as seminal as Uriah
*26:51.360- 26:57.400* :  renders appointment. And the hope has to be that sounds appointment isn't then a case of we're
*26:57.400- 27:02.080* :  waiting another 15, 20 years from another black official. I don't think that'll be a case. I've
*27:02.080- 27:07.260* :  got my finger on the pulse within our community and within football generally. And I know there are
*27:07.260- 27:13.320* :  young mature aspiring officials who are capable. And if they get the opportunity, they get the
*27:13.320- 27:19.240* :  relevant training, they can do a job. But perhaps it isn't for lack of trying. Ashley Hicks and
*27:19.240- 27:24.340* :  Lovens is a level four county referee who dreamed of being a professional footballer. When it was
*27:24.340- 27:29.260* :  clear that wasn't going to happen, he chose refereeing in order to remain in the sport he loved.
*27:29.260- 27:35.040* :  Sam Allison's climb to the top for him is bitter sweet. First of all, I was absolutely delighted
*27:35.440- 27:39.960* :  just to see a black man get an appointment in the Premier League. It was also tinge
*27:39.960- 27:44.400* :  driver a bit of sadness, I suppose, that has taken so long because it should be happening more
*27:44.400- 27:50.580* :  regularly. Mark's given by FA appointed observers is one factor we've been told affects a match
*27:50.580- 27:56.920* :  officials progression. Referees we spoke to say this gradient system could be one reason why some
*27:56.920- 28:01.680* :  are finding it difficult to climb the ladder. Level four in the refereeing ladder is known as
*28:01.680- 28:07.500* :  the black man's graveyard. Even the connotations of graveyard is very fitting because it's like
*28:07.500- 28:12.000* :  the death and for me reaching level four was the death of my refereeing career because that's
*28:12.000- 28:16.420* :  as far as I got before I stopped. I was doing everything to come across as professional as I can,
*28:16.420- 28:22.460* :  especially if I had observer. And I started to notice certain things and hear certain things that
*28:22.460- 28:27.060* :  would imply that there was more at play here than just my ability to referee a game of football
*28:27.060- 28:32.020* :  in the football field. Little comments started to add up comments a little about my hair which
*28:32.020- 28:37.280* :  was a, you know, a high top at the time. It's a sort of amalgamation of the comments and the marks
*28:37.280- 28:41.840* :  and the stories and the anecdotes. And sometimes that's really hard to articulate as a
*28:42.000- 28:46.080* :  black person or as a person of colour. It's really hard to put your finger on what it is exactly,
*28:46.460- 28:52.040* :  you know, I can name eight, nine, ten other referees that were coming up through the system as I was
*28:52.040- 28:59.440* :  at the time and similar stories, similar experiences of being marked down judged in a sort of very
*28:59.440- 29:05.360* :  demeaning manner at times. A spokesperson for the FA told us that recruitment, retention and
*29:05.360- 29:10.840* :  development of referees from all backgrounds is a focal point of their new strategy and they want
*29:10.840- 29:16.840* :  to ensure that everyone can feel valued and supported at all levels of the game. I think that
*29:16.840- 29:21.660* :  referees are a species that's in trouble, you know, when you look at what they go through at
*29:21.660- 29:26.360* :  grassroots level. One of the stars of the Premier League at the time was Arsenal striker Ian Wright.
*29:26.940- 29:31.320* :  So the conveyor belt of people coming through, it has to be made a lot easier for them.
*29:31.620- 29:35.740* :  We haven't got enough good referees and if we're just going to restrict it to not letting black
*29:35.740- 29:39.400* :  referees or Asian referees get in there for whatever reason and we're going to carry on
*29:39.820- 29:43.140* :  at the levels what we're seeing now where they're making mistakes left right and centre.
*29:45.480- 29:49.680* :  Former England and Arsenal star Ian Wright ending that report by Nista McGregor.
*29:51.000- 29:55.560* :  As we record this podcast, people across the world are recovering from their Christmas celebrations.
*29:55.580- 30:00.680* :  Some may have eaten or drunk too much or perhaps spent a lot of time with their families,
*30:01.200- 30:07.180* :  but as Tim Allman reports, others have taken part in some more unusual Christmas activities.
*30:10.900- 30:16.660* :  Some Christmas traditions are a little more eccentric than others. Here in this part of Berlin,
*30:16.660- 30:22.580* :  they care not for chocolate selection boxes, roast turkey or mould wine. Instead,
*30:22.580- 30:28.160* :  they strip down and go for a dip in a lake. It's not unusual to have to break through the ice
*30:28.240- 30:32.040* :  to reach the water, but this year it was and seasonably mild.
*30:36.840- 30:42.320* :  On Christmas Day it's particularly sociable and fun. It's an old tradition and it's been going on
*30:42.320- 30:49.980* :  for more than 40 years. On the other side of the world, Christmas coincides with the height of
*30:49.980- 30:56.560* :  summer. That Sydney's famous Bondi beach, they celebrated with surfing, sunbathing and even a
*30:56.560- 31:02.420* :  spot of spiritual salvation. It's all about family, so most of this has been traveling,
*31:02.420- 31:06.900* :  we've come to see how we love her, but the sun, it gives you a boost, you're joyful,
*31:07.360- 31:10.560* :  and you've got to take those moments for what they are, a moment of happiness,
*31:10.560- 31:16.180* :  and that's what Jesus went up on to. In the US, one couple decided to tie the knot during
*31:16.180- 31:21.000* :  the festive period. Their venue, the ice rink in the cities of famous common,
*31:21.020- 31:27.260* :  a touching moment with fairly practical too. After all, it should make remembering the date of
*31:27.260- 31:34.100* :  your anniversary, a piece of cake. Sounds like it could also be a very expensive time of year,
*31:34.100- 31:41.960* :  that report by Tim Allman. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of
*31:41.960- 31:45.840* :  the Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or topics coverage,
