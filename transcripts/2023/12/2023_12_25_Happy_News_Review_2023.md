*00:22.380- 00:28.920* :  multi-million dollar international Christmas music industry and asking what is the recipe for a
*00:28.920- 00:35.200* :  successful Christmas song and why do the old tunes do the best. The global story brings you
*00:35.200- 00:40.800* :  fresh takes and new perspectives from BBC journalists all around the world, find us wherever you get
*00:40.800- 00:54.360* :  your BBC podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast Happy News Review 2023 from the BBC World Service.
*00:57.260- 01:03.040* :  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition, uploaded on Monday, December 25th, we'll be reminding you of
*01:03.040- 01:08.160* :  some of the more positive stories that made headlines around the world this year. So any of these
*01:08.160- 01:14.420* :  ring a bell? Air lifted to safety from the jungle after a story of survival against the odds.
*01:18.180- 01:22.500* :  The rescuers were met with cheers and clapping from the men that were inside.
*01:24.780- 01:27.200* :  It will help many children not just mine.
*01:37.800- 01:43.720* :  So we have extraordinary rescues, an excellent solution to an ongoing injustice, medical brilliance,
*01:43.920- 01:49.660* :  some very fortunate macaques, some good news on Blue Whales, and this year's favourite unit of
*01:49.660- 01:58.060* :  measurement. Also in this podcast, we celebrate musical records broken, the adrenaline rush of
*01:58.060- 02:03.400* :  some magnificent sport, and an Italian man who just popped out to buy bread and made a life-saving
*02:07.820- 02:12.960* :  catch. And we begin with a rescue that had people around the world absolutely gripped.
*02:13.300- 02:18.940* :  Back in August, a cable car in Pakistan's mountainous northern region was left dangling hundreds
*02:18.940- 02:26.100* :  of metres above the ground when two wires snapped. On board was seven school pupils and a teacher.
*02:26.660- 02:33.780* :  It took military helicopters, locals using floodlights and zip wires and some steely nerve to rescue
*02:33.780- 02:37.120* :  them all. Here's our Pakistan correspondent, Caroline Davis.
*02:41.660- 02:47.540* :  Through the darkness and forest, the sight the crowds had been hoping, waiting and praying for.
*02:48.240- 02:53.660* :  Strap to the cable, the final rescue, waiting arms and shouts of God is great.
*02:57.900- 03:02.900* :  15 hours earlier, the children were taking the cable car to school when a cable snapped.
*03:03.180- 03:08.820* :  Make shift cable cars are common in the rural mountains of Pakistan, taking minutes over ravines
*03:08.820- 03:14.040* :  while roads take hours. At first, army helicopters couldn't rescue them,
*03:14.420- 03:19.040* :  buffeted by winds, scared the downwash from the blades could make the situation worse.
*03:20.000- 03:26.300* :  Local TV managed to speak to one man inside the cable car, rising panic before his phone died.
*03:29.420- 03:34.540* :  I don't know how to make a request, but it's a matter of human lives. As you can imagine,
*03:34.540- 03:37.900* :  the authorities should rescue all of us as soon as possible.
*03:39.280- 03:41.740* :  Officials tried to reassure the growing crowds.
*03:43.840- 03:48.880* :  Now, a special unit is coming. The local rescue team are already on standby. We are trying,
*03:48.880- 03:51.000* :  but really don't want to take any chances here.
*03:53.940- 04:00.340* :  As the light went, the helicopters left. Instead, locals and rescue officials used police
*04:00.340- 04:07.000* :  and zip lines, dragging themselves along wires. As the night set in, dark, strong winds,
*04:07.480- 04:11.460* :  hundreds of feet in the air, but determined to reach those stranded,
*04:12.100- 04:14.700* :  slowly and steadily, saving all of them.
*04:18.360- 04:24.200* :  Some appeared stunned, landing in the crowd. A journey to school near tragedy
*04:24.840- 04:29.620* :  now followed by people around the world and relief at their safe return.
*04:41.640- 04:48.460* :  That sound isn't just any old program's sigtune. That is the sound of optimism and opportunity,
*04:49.160- 04:53.840* :  and an excellent solution to a very serious problem. It's also a chance for us to salute our
*04:53.840- 04:59.660* :  colleagues from the BBC Afghan service, because when the new school year started in Afghanistan and
*04:59.660- 05:04.160* :  for the second year running, teenage girls were excluded after a ruling from the Taliban.
*05:04.740- 05:08.340* :  They decided they would get school to children who couldn't go in person.
*05:08.980- 05:14.040* :  And they launched a program called Dars, which means lesson in Dari and Pashto,
*05:14.460- 05:20.620* :  and it's hosted by BBC Afghan journalists who were evacuated from Kabul during the 2021 Taliban
*05:20.620- 05:26.560* :  takeover. Let's hear from producer Maryam and mom and presenter Aliyah Fazon.
*05:27.300- 05:32.300* :  It's going wonderful, and we are so happy to be part of this whole project, which we find
*05:33.240- 05:38.200* :  noble, exciting, you name it, all the good feelings of the world comes with this project.
*05:38.940- 05:44.240* :  And the reception has been great, we are overwhelmed with the amount of positive feedbacks we are getting.
*05:45.120- 05:49.960* :  Zimartola Hassadada, that is, I'm trying my best to make students learn something,
*05:49.960- 05:57.680* :  and the Dars program has helped me a lot. My students watch this show with interest and passion.
*05:58.140- 06:02.660* :  Dear hopes have been raised, and they are still dreaming for the future.
*06:04.900- 06:10.560* :  Dars Baman Omid, Dars gives me hope. I was wondering if there are people out there
*06:10.560- 06:16.760* :  that care about me. Now I know. I hope one day I will be able to go back to school,
*06:17.380- 06:21.740* :  but until then, Dars can help me to feel connected with my classroom.
*06:21.740- 06:29.500* :  And Fazon. Recently, UN called this program a lifeline for the goals of Afghanistan,
*06:29.500- 06:36.460* :  which was quite a proud moment. And Aliyah, you're one of the presenters. Tell us a little bit more
*06:36.460- 06:42.780* :  about what it means for its audience. I have been in the country after our first season was over,
*06:42.800- 06:48.660* :  and whenever I went that they had their TVs on, they were watching it, and I saw that some kids
*06:48.660- 06:54.160* :  were pretending to be one of the presenters or one of the teachers. Yeah, and it was wonderful
*06:54.180- 07:02.820* :  that I saw that we were doing great, and I kind of saw the result of the patience and the hard work
*07:02.820- 07:09.520* :  that we did in the past few months, and it was promising. It gives me hope, and it gives me the
*07:09.520- 07:16.780* :  power and the ability to work even harder and harder. And just give us a little outline about
*07:16.780- 07:22.520* :  what subjects you're actually teaching, because it's a relatively wide age range that you're
*07:22.520- 07:27.380* :  aiming for as well, isn't it? We have really a strong English, we have a constant
*07:27.380- 07:33.680* :  maths, and then a third subject would be different every other week that will be history, biology,
*07:33.680- 07:40.720* :  chemistry, and a lot of animation for our audiences who can access TV, but different treatment
*07:40.720- 07:46.260* :  for the audiences who are able to listen to us on radio, which is quite prominent in Afghanistan.
*07:47.420- 07:52.440* :  And tell us a little bit about what you had to do to get it going. We worked with Bite Size and
*07:52.440- 07:58.240* :  learning English from part of the World Service. We took their content and we adapted it into
*07:58.240- 08:04.040* :  Farsi and Pashto, the two main languages of Afghanistan. We also paid a lot of attention to cultural
*08:04.040- 08:10.260* :  sensitivities and cultural relevancy, so we changed the names from I don't know Philip to something
*08:10.260- 08:17.640* :  called Farid, or things that Afghans would find it more at home. And Alia, you've already seen
*08:17.640- 08:22.920* :  for yourself little girls want to beat you, they are acting like you. What does it mean when you
*08:22.920- 08:29.700* :  see something like that, to be part of something like this? Being part of a team that's working for
*08:29.700- 08:34.860* :  the Afghan children who are banned from different kind of education, such as the girls are banned
*08:34.860- 08:40.000* :  from going to school and also buys or ban to seeking education just because of the economical
*08:40.000- 08:45.160* :  situation and also in some part of the country because of the security situation. So being part
*08:45.160- 08:52.320* :  of this project is at a very big responsibility as well as being a very positive and fan project.
*08:52.800- 08:58.320* :  I think that we have to work more and more that we can satisfy those people, especially the
*08:58.320- 09:04.420* :  parents who are relying on us and they say that Darce is giving their children hope, so it's
*09:04.420- 09:12.040* :  very strong and also positive and promising. That was presenter Alia Fazon and producer Mariam Amon.
*09:12.720- 09:16.960* :  Now there have been some big positive medical stories this year. We'll start with good news on
*09:16.960- 09:22.680* :  malaria. The WHO, the World Health Organization, recommending only the second malaria vaccine,
*09:22.680- 09:29.300* :  one that can be produced on a massive scale. Malaria kills mostly babies and infants and that's
*09:29.300- 09:34.920* :  why this mom, Muzani Saif, in Tanzania, enrolled her little girl in the trial of the new vaccine.
*09:37.340- 09:44.000* :  I lost my nephew. We buried him. He was only four when he died from malaria. That's why when I
*09:44.000- 09:49.920* :  heard that there was a malaria vaccine trial, I said I wanted to put his feet. It will help many
*09:49.920- 09:56.380* :  children, but just mine. So that's where we'll start on the year's good medical stories with the
*09:56.380- 10:02.420* :  BBC's Medical Editor, Fergus Walsh, the second malaria vaccine, R21, developed at Oxford.
*10:03.200- 10:10.160* :  The big difference, the big advantage of the Oxford vaccine compared to the GSK one, because they
*10:10.160- 10:18.420* :  seem to be roughly similarly effective, is scale. Oxford have partnered with the world's biggest
*10:18.860- 10:26.460* :  vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute in India, and the Oxford vaccine will be about half the
*10:26.500- 10:34.620* :  price. So scale and cost, it just means that more children will be protected from this really awful
*10:34.620- 10:40.980* :  disease. And tell us about this new gene therapy, it's just been given approval that could cure
*10:41.020- 10:49.200* :  two blood disorders. It's to treat a condition in the sickle cell disease. In the UK, it's also
*10:49.200- 10:55.140* :  been approved to treat another blood disorder called beta thalassemia. Both are inherited blood
*10:55.140- 11:01.820* :  disorders. They cause serious problems. They can be life limiting. With sickle cell, people can end
*11:01.820- 11:08.020* :  up having these excruciatingly painful episodes ending up in hospital. And with beta thalassemia,
*11:08.060- 11:13.120* :  they mainly blood transfusions every few weeks of their lives. So this is a really big deal.
*11:13.320- 11:23.640* :  And now we have a treatment, a one-off treatment of these gene edited cells, which so far in trials
*11:23.800- 11:30.900* :  looked like they were curative, what you would call a functional cure. The actual research is a
*11:30.900- 11:36.160* :  technique known as CRISPR, which stands for clusters of regally interspaced short-palendomic
*11:36.160- 11:44.440* :  repeats. It's a technique which was discovered just over a decade ago in trials. It more than
*11:44.440- 11:50.040* :  nine out of ten people in the trials, either no longer had painful episodes in sickle cell.
*11:50.440- 11:55.940* :  And for beta thalassemia, which is the treatment approved also in the UK, they no longer need a
*11:55.940- 12:02.540* :  blood transfusion. So it's a one-off, potentially curative treatment. So a big deal, but it's
*12:02.540- 12:08.260* :  really expensive. Now, one other positive story that caught my eye, not least because my own
*12:08.260- 12:16.400* :  family has been touched by Alzheimer's, is a potentially very positive development in treating
*12:16.400- 12:22.580* :  Alzheimer's disease. Yes, I mean, I've been covering Alzheimer's, which is the most common form
*12:22.580- 12:30.620* :  of dementia for many, many years. And now we have two drugs, the canemap, which is approved in the US,
*12:31.380- 12:41.200* :  and the canemap. Both of them seem to slow the rate of decline of early Alzheimer's by about
*12:41.200- 12:47.480* :  a third. Now, what that means in practical terms is they seem to give patients who take the drugs
*12:47.960- 12:55.460* :  around six months extra of time where they are, if you might put it themselves, they are,
*12:55.500- 13:00.160* :  they are able to be independent before their condition develops. So it's not a cure,
*13:00.780- 13:07.940* :  but it is a sign that there are positive ways forward. Yes, I really think it's very positive
*13:07.940- 13:16.640* :  moment. I've never seen Alzheimer's researchers so positive because we now have a chink in the
*13:16.640- 13:22.980* :  armour of this terrible disease. That is something to be celebrated. And just finally, you are our
*13:22.980- 13:30.080* :  medical editor. You spend your days wading through journals and papers and all sorts of things.
*13:31.160- 13:37.980* :  When you see something that looks like it might be incredibly positive, talk us through your
*13:37.980- 13:43.560* :  thought process. Do you get excited about it? Do you start trying to pull it apart? How does it work?
*13:44.220- 13:50.580* :  Well, it's a bit of a mix of both of those. I mean, extraordinary claims need extraordinary
*13:50.580- 13:59.060* :  proof. So first of all, show me the evidence from trials because people do send me staff saying,
*13:59.060- 14:04.180* :  well, you know, we've got this, this seems to work. And I've got patients who say their life's
*14:04.180- 14:11.380* :  been turned around by this compound. And I say, okay, show me the actual proof from the trials.
*14:12.280- 14:18.180* :  But we do get breakthroughs. Most of them are incremental and therefore don't make the news.
*14:18.400- 14:23.240* :  But when you get these step changes as we did with gene editing and gene therapy,
*14:23.980- 14:29.480* :  it does make you sit back and think, wow, I mean, it's a fantastic feel to be a part of it because
*14:29.480- 14:38.120* :  although I also report on global disease threats, the thing I enjoy most is reporting on medical
*14:38.120- 14:46.060* :  advances that will help patients lead healthier, longer lives. That's really what it's all about.
*14:47.680- 14:53.920* :  That was our medical editor, Fergus Walsh. Now, to Turin in Italy and the heroic Mathia Aguotsi,
*14:54.160- 15:00.700* :  who back in September made an amazing catch after hearing desperate cries from high above the street.
*15:01.420- 15:07.760* :  Looking up, we saw a little girl at the fifth floor. She was angry just with her small lens
*15:07.760- 15:13.960* :  to the balcony. In that moment, I was following her movements. I opened my arms, I closed the
*15:13.960- 15:20.480* :  eyes and I opened to catch her. I don't know how, but I did it. She fell down my chest in my arms.
*15:20.620- 15:26.460* :  It has been a strong impact. Both of us fell down the street. I couldn't breathe for a few moments.
*15:26.460- 15:31.840* :  Then after a while, she started crying. The worst was over. She was alive.
*15:32.440- 15:37.120* :  It was a long, full, huge catch. You did fall to the ground. Are you okay?
*15:37.980- 15:42.780* :  Yes, yes, I'm okay. The strongest impact has been under an emotional point of view.
*15:43.380- 15:48.340* :  The following night I could sleep just a few hours. I started thinking more and more about what
*15:48.340- 15:54.520* :  happened. Or maybe more about what, fortunately, they didn't happen. The little girl, is she okay?
*15:55.100- 15:59.220* :  Yes, also the baby is fine. This is the most important thing for me.
*15:59.800- 16:05.240* :  What's it like to be a hero? No, no, I don't feel like a hero. I follow my instinct.
*16:05.240- 16:11.560* :  Hope that anybody else will have done the same. For me, in that fragment of second,
*16:11.560- 16:13.460* :  it was the only right thing to do.
*16:14.640- 16:20.960* :  Mathia Agootsie, and yes, we're going with hero. Now, let's go to Colombia for another astonishing
*16:20.960- 16:28.120* :  story of survival against the odds. Four children who spent 40 days lost in the Colombian jungle
*16:28.120- 16:33.500* :  after the plane crash that killed their mum and two pilots. They were rescued in June,
*16:34.060- 16:36.980* :  and this was how Simon Jones reported their story.
*16:38.820- 16:43.900* :  Air lifted to safety from the jungle after a story of survival against the odds.
*16:45.100- 16:49.860* :  Pictures released by the Colombian President were the first confirmation that the four rescue
*16:49.860- 16:55.800* :  children wrapped in foil blankets were alive. They were found by the military after a huge
*16:55.800- 17:00.520* :  and long search. The children forced to fend for themselves for more than five weeks.
*17:02.580- 17:07.120* :  Hundreds of soldiers had been involved in the desperate hunt for the children, aged 13,
*17:07.540- 17:08.780* :  9, 4 and 1.
*17:14.840- 17:18.860* :  A recorded message was played from the air, instructing them if they heard it,
*17:18.860- 17:23.400* :  to stay still and wait for help. They had been missing since the start of May,
*17:23.400- 17:27.200* :  when the plane they were in crashed. The bodies of the children's mother,
*17:27.200- 17:31.840* :  the pilot and the co-pilot were found, but there was hope the children were still alive
*17:31.840- 17:37.360* :  after items left behind by them, including a drinking bottle and half-eaten fruit were found.
*17:39.100- 17:42.720* :  The children belonged to the Wee Toto Indigenous group is thought their knowledge of
*17:42.760- 17:45.640* :  fruits and jungle survival skills helped keep them safe.
*17:50.280- 17:53.040* :  Their family can scarcely believe this moment has come.
*17:53.040- 17:59.500* :  It's something that we are happy because, until now, we couldn't sleep, couldn't be happy,
*17:59.840- 18:05.300* :  couldn't talk. For us, the situation was like being in the dark, living for the sake of living,
*18:05.300- 18:10.500* :  because the hope of finding them kept us alive. When we found the children, we felt joy.
*18:11.060- 18:13.880* :  We don't know what to do, but we are grateful to God.
*18:15.420- 18:19.440* :  The children have been flown to the capital Bogotá for a full medical assessment.
*18:19.440- 18:24.040* :  They are weak, they are tired, but their rescuers are calling this a magical day.
*18:25.620- 18:26.500* :  And that was Simon Jones.
*18:29.580- 18:32.860* :  Still to come in this podcast. There's just no stopping her at the minute.
*18:32.920- 18:37.360* :  She is at the real crest of a wave in a career that has had its ups and downs.
*18:39.000- 18:42.780* :  If I tell you that's our music correspondent, you might guess who he's talking about.
*18:43.080- 18:43.900* :  We'll have more later.
*18:54.740- 19:00.360* :  Hello, I'm Katya Adler. Today on The Global Story, I'll be taking a look into the multi-million dollar
*19:00.780- 19:05.840* :  international Christmas music industry and asking what is the recipe for a successful
*19:05.840- 19:12.300* :  Christmas song? And why do the old tunes do the best? The global story brings you fresh takes
*19:12.300- 19:17.280* :  and new perspectives from BBC Journalists all around the world. Find us wherever you get
*19:17.340- 19:18.420* :  your BBC podcasts.
*19:25.980- 19:28.760* :  Now, what about this good news from India in November?
*19:32.660- 19:38.440* :  The sound as 41 construction workers emerged from a collapsed tunnel in the Himalayas
*19:38.680- 19:44.000* :  after being trapped for 17 days. Their rescue operation beset with problems and
*19:44.000- 19:49.460* :  multiple setbacks. Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein told us about the difficulties
*19:49.460- 19:56.380* :  of the rescue. When the drilling machine finally broke down and they decided that they were
*19:56.380- 20:01.440* :  going to abandon it altogether because it was the focus of so many technical difficulties.
*20:01.940- 20:07.640* :  So what they did is they were installing a pipe. So what they did instead of trying to drill a
*20:07.640- 20:13.180* :  hole and then push it through, they just pushed the pipe through and then they would manually
*20:13.180- 20:19.180* :  remove the debris until they finally breached the last of the rubble and the rescuers were met
*20:19.180- 20:22.320* :  with cheers and clapping from the men that were inside.
*20:23.820- 20:29.000* :  Samira Hussein, now let's have a quick run through of some of the years other positive stories
*20:29.000- 20:34.040* :  that you might remember. In June, there were the 11 women sanitation workers in the southern
*20:34.040- 20:39.580* :  Indian state of Kerala who pulled their money to buy a lottery ticket and won the jackpot worth
*20:39.580- 20:45.240* :  over a million dollars. Then there was Tim Shaddock, the Australian sailor and his dog Bella,
*20:45.240- 20:50.240* :  who survived two months in the Pacific Ocean by eating raw fish and drinking rainwater.
*20:50.640- 20:55.340* :  This was Tim after they were rescued by a trawler. I didn't think I'd make it through the storm,
*20:55.340- 21:01.900* :  but now I'm really doing good. How is Bella? How is Bella? She's amazing. That dog is
*21:02.640- 21:05.720* :  is something else. She's a lot more braver than I am. That's a shot.
*21:07.560- 21:11.620* :  Congratulations to Norwegian Mountaineer Christian Herala and Nepalese climate
*21:11.620- 21:19.200* :  Tenjin Sherpa Lama, who in July set a new record climbing the 14 super peaks in just over three months.
*21:19.220- 21:25.840* :  And what about the unflappable calm of Rudolf Erasmus, the pilot who was flying four passengers
*21:25.840- 21:32.740* :  from South Africa's Western Cape, when at 3,000 meters he realized he had company in the form of a
*21:32.740- 21:37.940* :  venomous Cape Cobra snake. I honestly thought initially it was my water bottle leaking.
*21:38.540- 21:43.200* :  When I looked back down, I saw the head of the snake receding kind of needs to seat, but I could
*21:43.200- 21:47.220* :  see it's tongue flickering about as it went down underneath. So I informed the passengers that
*21:47.220- 21:52.980* :  listen, we've got a lot of a situation on board. The snake is underneath my seat. So we're going to
*21:52.980- 21:57.300* :  have to try and get the aircraft back on the ground as soon as we can. Luckily I'm also all of the
*21:57.300- 22:02.400* :  passengers who were quite calm as well. Luckily no one was panicking with fear. Do you be truly
*22:02.400- 22:06.880* :  honest? I really can't remember the amount of time it took. It felt like an eternity, but it was
*22:06.880- 22:11.840* :  probably something like 10 minutes or 15 minutes at most. That's a very long 15 minutes, right?
*22:12.300- 22:19.480* :  100%. That was Rudolf Erasmus. I'm pretty sure somebody made a film about that.
*22:19.980- 22:25.060* :  Now let's talk about some of the scientific brilliance that happened in 2023. We told the BBC
*22:25.060- 22:29.640* :  science correspondent Jonathan Amos he had to pick his favourite stories this year. He began with
*22:29.640- 22:36.800* :  the asteroid Bennu and the operation to bring back samples to earth. It's fascinating lump of rock
*22:36.920- 22:42.060* :  and NASA sent a spacecraft out there and they scooped up some material and they brought it back.
*22:42.680- 22:47.900* :  Parachute came out and it landed in the west desert of Utah. This isn't just the most glorious
*22:47.900- 22:53.920* :  landscape. This thing comes down, capsule and then they pick it up and they open it up and inside
*22:53.920- 23:01.320* :  it's this glorious black dust. I mean just magic. The elements that were in this material
*23:01.940- 23:06.920* :  were around 4.6 billion years ago so just as the planets were about to form and that's
*23:07.380- 23:11.160* :  it's kind of really what the other scientists wanted to go get this stuff forward because they
*23:11.160- 23:17.840* :  expect chemistry in this material to reveal secrets of how it all got going 4.6 billion years ago.
*23:17.840- 23:23.820* :  Isn't that amazing? It is amazing and as I recall when you were covering the recovery of this
*23:23.820- 23:30.340* :  stuff from Bennu you did also give us a new unit of measurement which was the size of an adult
*23:30.340- 23:36.440* :  hamster and I would like to thank you for that. I must tell you about the hamster so they thought
*23:36.440- 23:43.900* :  that they would get about 250 grams. Now I don't go around measuring hamsters okay but the adult
*23:43.900- 23:51.080* :  hamsters I am told are of that kind of mass so 250 grams. Now the issue was they would weigh all
*23:51.080- 23:56.240* :  the material when they got it out. Whisper this quietly Jackie but they haven't been able to get it
*23:56.240- 24:02.600* :  all out of the capsule. Oh my goodness. They've managed to get out about 70 grams which is more than
*24:03.240- 24:08.700* :  on their sort of basic requirements to go get right so they're perfectly happy but then there could
*24:08.700- 24:14.420* :  be 200 more grams of the hamster still inside the capsule. Now the problem comes down to a
*24:14.420- 24:19.620* :  couple of fasteners can you believe this? They haven't got the tools to open this is NASA no
*24:20.480- 24:27.440* :  they haven't got the tools to open these last two fasteners so they've had to go away design some
*24:27.440- 24:32.660* :  new tools and then they'll try and get the rest of the hamster out. You were also very excited
*24:32.660- 24:40.880* :  in the summertime June July time about new discoveries that were made about Pompeii a town
*24:40.880- 24:52.500* :  city that was covered by volcanic ash in 79 AD at AD or common era and we're still learning about it.
*24:54.340- 25:01.160* :  Yeah it's one of those occasions where you draw literally touches the floor and I had the privilege
*25:01.160- 25:08.920* :  of going into a new dig at Pompeii and they decided to open up a I guess you might call it a
*25:08.920- 25:16.960* :  city block and they found this amazing villa with glorious designs geometric designs on the walls
*25:16.960- 25:23.040* :  all still visible right I mean we're talking in almost 2000 years ago and the colours were as
*25:23.040- 25:28.940* :  vibrant as the day that they were put up it was just amazing and this is the place where they found
*25:29.620- 25:36.640* :  a mural of what looks like a pizza so one of the archaeologists they've said come here come here
*25:36.640- 25:43.180* :  come now look and he lifted up the tarp all in and there on the wall was this extraordinary
*25:43.180- 25:50.300* :  painting of a meal and it looked for the world like it was a pizza now it couldn't have been a pizza
*25:50.640- 25:57.640* :  right but get technical for a minute here are because the sort of pizza that we know was not
*25:57.640- 26:03.480* :  invented by this time for one thing there were no tomatoes and tomatoes are a key ingredient of
*26:03.720- 26:10.020* :  of pizza there is that so tomatoes came later but it's just sort of sort of flat bread I think
*26:10.020- 26:17.280* :  the thing that really struck me was the intricate the exquisite style of paintings and murals
*26:17.280- 26:24.740* :  that I saw on the walls I'll remember that for a long time that was Jonathan Amos now sports news
*26:24.740- 26:32.040* :  is often big on drama and 2023 was no exception Nigel Adely has been limbering up and gathered
*26:32.140- 26:38.060* :  together some of the highlights for us come back to something which sports fans always love to see
*26:38.740- 26:44.560* :  and few have been more glorious than Simone Biles it seemed we'd seen the last of one of the
*26:44.560- 26:50.360* :  greatest gymnasts ever when the American departed the Tokyo Olympics mid competition two years ago
*26:51.140- 26:57.580* :  saying she needed to take time out to prioritize her mental health but she was back at this year's
*26:57.580- 27:04.480* :  world championships in Antwerp and charmed and amazed both fans and teammates with a stunning
*27:12.740- 27:18.880* :  return to form with four gold medals and two silvers to cement her position as the sports
*27:18.880- 27:36.360* :  undisputed best ever Spain lifted the women's world cup for the first time after a thrilling
*27:36.360- 27:42.560* :  tournament in Australia and New Zealand with record crowds and the realization of dreams for
*27:50.980- 27:56.120* :  so many and that included the performance of the African teams South Africa's dramatic last
*27:56.120- 28:02.600* :  minute winner over Italy sent them into the knockout phase Nigeria beat the might of Australia on
*28:02.600- 28:09.300* :  the way to qualifying and only lost to England on penalties to win their run and Morocco helped
*28:09.300- 28:15.960* :  to knock out Germany there was also a group stage win for Zambia over Costa Rica on the World Cup
*28:15.960- 28:23.260* :  debut these were all performances which demanded respect and will inspire new generations of young
*28:23.260- 28:31.660* :  players played nine lost nine was Afghanistan's sorry record at the cricket World Cup four years ago
*28:32.440- 28:38.300* :  but this time was a different story their astonishing progress was highlighted by shock
*28:38.300- 28:47.020* :  victories over reigning champions England and Pakistan 21-year-old Ibrahim Zadram became the first
*28:47.020- 28:53.400* :  Afghan to score a century to World Cup and their youthful team were only denied a place in the
*28:53.400- 29:00.720* :  semifinals by a miracle comeback from Australia when it seemed another major upset was about to happen
*29:01.700- 29:08.560* :  the squad returned home as heroes and are now role models in a country where cricket has become an
*29:08.560- 29:16.560* :  obsession Nigel Adely history was made in music this year when Beyoncé became the Grammy's most
*29:16.560- 29:22.920* :  successful artist of all time the four Grammy Awards her Renaissance album received at this year's
*29:22.920- 29:30.060* :  ceremony back in February took her to a career total so far of 32 marks average is our music
*29:30.060- 29:37.680* :  correspondent it's a really big deal because Beyoncé has quite famously been sidelined by the
*29:37.680- 29:44.020* :  Grammys in a lot of ways although she's won this huge hall of award she's only ever won one
*29:44.020- 29:49.460* :  in what they call the big four the main prizes that are given out on the night so that's record
*29:49.460- 29:55.800* :  of the year song of the year album of the year and best new artist but she's kind of been quietly
*29:55.800- 30:00.220* :  collecting them up in the R&B categories in the music video categories
*30:09.900- 30:13.900* :  and eventually that's given her enough head of steam to overtake everyone as the most
*30:13.900- 30:20.880* :  award-winning artist of all time the question that that raises is will it be enough for her to one
*30:20.880- 30:26.480* :  day win album of the year or get one of those prizes that really cement you as the defining
*30:26.480- 30:32.100* :  artist of your era does she really need one of what you describe as the big four
*30:33.960- 30:36.720* :  she doesn't need them I don't think anybody needs an award
*30:40.780- 30:48.380* :  I mean I wouldn't turn one down but for Beyoncé I think the real power of her entire career is the
*30:48.380- 30:54.280* :  cultural impact she's had things that she talks about about black civil rights about feminine
*30:54.280- 31:02.200* :  power she is a self-made woman in terms of the creativity that she displays the visuals that she
*31:02.200- 31:09.240* :  creates so a big year for Beyoncé Taylor Swift had a pretty big year too Taylor Swift really has
*31:09.240- 31:14.960* :  dominated the musical conversation this year it all kind of began with this era's tour that
*31:14.960- 31:19.920* :  hit the ground running earlier this year it's a retrospective of her career and an absolutely
*31:19.920- 31:24.180* :  mammoth undertaking she plays for nearly four hours a night
*31:33.900- 31:39.460* :  and the demand for that tour was so high that it made ticketmaster crash which just shows you
*31:39.460- 31:47.300* :  how much power Taylor Swift has and then the tour itself it broke all box office records she's
*31:47.300- 31:52.140* :  thought to have made more than two hundred million dollars just from the first leg of the tour so
*31:52.460- 31:57.560* :  there's just no stopping her at the minute she is at the real crest of a wave in a career that has
*31:57.560- 32:05.720* :  had its ups and downs and her cat too and her cat too appeared on Time magazine when she was awarded
*32:05.720- 32:11.860* :  time person of the year that's the type yeah and yes she insisted that her cat Benjamin button
*32:12.240- 32:16.660* :  be draped around her shoulders on the cover of the magazine and I think that's one of the great
*32:16.660- 32:23.260* :  things about Taylor Swift you know a lot of pop stars are inaccessible and unrelatable if you
*32:23.260- 32:28.160* :  watch the tour film when the camera is up close on her she kind of almost has this all shocks
*32:28.640- 32:33.120* :  appearance you know I can't believe that I'm here there's something about Taylor Swift where she
*32:33.120- 32:39.340* :  really does gather people around her in a way that a lot of pop stars don't and Mark I have to
*32:39.340- 32:44.720* :  ask you this because you're our music correspondent your song of the year please my song of the year
*32:44.720- 32:59.360* :  is called a and w and it's by Lana Del Rey and it is an absolutely stunning piece of work it's
*32:59.480- 33:03.540* :  seven minutes long and it is a sublime song I love it to bits
*33:05.260- 33:12.320* :  Lana Del Rey and Mark Savage our music correspondent now a lot of journalists not just me love a good
*33:12.320- 33:18.520* :  animal story and this year the headlines have been graced by whales bears and a magnificent
*33:18.520- 33:26.240* :  African tortoise among others Harry Blie corralled them for us see what I did there in June 100,000
*33:26.240- 33:31.960* :  tock macaque monkeys in Sri Lanka were saved from being exported to China after conservation
*33:31.960- 33:37.800* :  organizations went to court forcing the government to scrap the plans doctor Lisa Jones angle from
*33:37.800- 33:42.740* :  the animal rights group Peter says these endangered monkeys with their orange and golden coat
*33:42.740- 33:48.680* :  and fabulous plume hairstyle aren't always popular with their human neighbors yeah some people say
*33:48.740- 33:54.060* :  oh they're past they raid my crops I'm sorry these macaques are just doing what any good macaque
*33:54.060- 33:59.680* :  does which is to be part of the environment to live commensually together with human and they've
*33:59.680- 34:05.120* :  done that for millennia Peter and other animal rights groups had warned that the monkeys could be
*34:05.120- 34:10.740* :  headed to labs instead of zoos as promised the decision was reversed by Sri Lanka's Court of Appeal
*34:11.540- 34:16.320* :  in the South American Andes region there was another conflict this time between farmers and the
*34:16.320- 34:22.020* :  local bear population Andean bears also known as spectacle bears are the species which inspired
*34:22.020- 34:27.760* :  the children's book character Paddington as their habitat was taken over by farmland bears would
*34:27.760- 34:33.480* :  on occasion attack cattle and each farmer's crops this led to farmers slaughtering bears in
*34:33.480- 34:39.880* :  retaliation the Colombian Wildlife Conservation Society helped broker a truth between the two helping
*34:39.880- 34:44.940* :  farmers build bear proof fencing in exchange for protecting the bears and the scheme has helped
*34:44.940- 34:51.560* :  boost other species in the region here's biologist Mauricio Velo Vargas we had the records of
*34:51.840- 34:58.680* :  the presence of cougars and deer and the bears inside of the farms and the people it's happy
*34:58.680- 35:05.920* :  to know that they are maintaining and helping to conserve different species of mammals and then in
*35:05.920- 35:11.460* :  the seashells the world's largest animals blue whales were found to have made a return to the
*35:11.460- 35:16.780* :  surrounding ocean decades after being wiped out by poaching scientists spent a year recording
*35:16.780- 35:22.860* :  sounds from the ocean using underwater microphones which picked up the low frequencies the blue whales
*35:22.860- 35:28.780* :  used to communicate over hundreds of kilometers one of the lead researchers was Dr. Kate Stafford
*35:28.880- 35:33.660* :  from Oregon State University we listened for over a year and we heard them in many months
*35:33.660- 35:37.860* :  the year that suggests that the seashells is really important for the blue whales and so
*35:37.860- 35:43.620* :  understanding when and where blue whales may have recovered and are coming back it's a conservation
*35:43.720- 35:48.980* :  win analysis found that blue whales had been spending months in this region of the Indian ocean
*35:48.980- 35:58.220* :  and could even have resumed breeding there that was Harry Bly and there we end this review of some
