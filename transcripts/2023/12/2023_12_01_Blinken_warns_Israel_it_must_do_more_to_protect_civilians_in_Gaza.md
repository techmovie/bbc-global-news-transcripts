*01:33.260- 01:36.400* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:38.960- 01:42.920* :  I'm Robin Brandt, and in the early hours of Friday the 1st of December, these are our
*01:42.920- 01:43.600* :  main stories.
*01:44.120- 01:49.380* :  The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has urged Israel to do more to protect civilians
*01:49.420- 01:53.900* :  if it restarts its attacks on Gaza after Thursday's release of hostages.
*01:54.600- 01:58.940* :  Delegates at the UN's Climate Summit have agreed to start paying millions of dollars
*01:58.940- 02:02.940* :  to countries hit by natural disasters that are linked to global warming.
*02:03.540- 02:09.020* :  And according New York has re-imposed a gagging order on Donald Trump banning him from criticizing
*02:09.180- 02:11.760* :  court officials in his civil fraud trial.
*02:15.260- 02:19.720* :  We begin in the Middle East, where the US Secretary of State has warned that Israel must
*02:19.720- 02:25.360* :  take effective steps to ensure the protection of civilians in Gaza before it restarts its
*02:25.360- 02:26.860* :  military operations there.
*02:27.020- 02:32.100* :  Anthony Blinken, who is on another visit to the region, outlines to reporters at a press
*02:32.100- 02:34.880* :  conference in Tel Aviv the measures he was calling for.
*02:35.200- 02:39.440* :  That means taking more effective steps to protect the lives of civilians, including by
*02:39.440- 02:43.580* :  clearly and precisely designated areas and places in southern and central Gaza, where
*02:43.580- 02:46.120* :  they can be safe and out of the line of fire.
*02:47.140- 02:50.820* :  It means avoiding further significant displacement of civilians inside of Gaza.
*02:51.400- 02:57.240* :  It means avoiding damage to life-critical infrastructure, like hospitals, like power stations,
*02:58.040- 02:58.980* :  like water facilities.
*02:59.560- 03:03.640* :  And it means giving civilians who have been displaced to southern Gaza the choice to return
*03:03.640- 03:05.980* :  to the north as soon as conditions permit.
*03:06.560- 03:09.200* :  There must be no enduring internal displacement.
*03:09.860- 03:13.860* :  All of this can be done in a manner that still enables Israel to achieve its objectives.
*03:14.600- 03:19.960* :  Of course, we know that every one of these elements is made more complicated by the fact
*03:19.960- 03:25.840* :  that Hamas intentionally embeds itself with civilians within and below hospitals, schools,
*03:26.680- 03:28.300* :  apartment buildings, refugee camps.
*03:28.680- 03:32.460* :  But Israel has the most sophisticated, one of the most sophisticated militaries in the
*03:32.460- 03:32.720* :  world.
*03:33.160- 03:38.360* :  It is capable of neutralizing the threat posed by Hamas while minimizing harm to innocent
*03:38.360- 03:39.200* :  men, women and children.
*03:40.180- 03:41.480* :  And it has an obligation to do so.
*03:41.900- 03:46.940* :  Anthony Blinken speaking in Tel Aviv, well, on Thursday, he met with Israel's Prime Minister
*03:46.940- 03:48.140* :  Benjamin Netanyahu.
*03:48.640- 03:54.380* :  Mr Blinken has also been pushing for the continuation of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas
*03:54.880- 03:56.600* :  that so far has lasted seven days.
*03:57.040- 04:00.960* :  He said this had allowed the doubling of aid, though this was still not enough.
*04:01.640- 04:06.620* :  Mr Blinken also demanded that Hamas immediately release all hostages and stop using them
*04:06.620- 04:08.320* :  as so-called human shields.
*04:08.900- 04:13.320* :  On Thursday evening, the Israel Defence Force said six people had been freed by Hamas.
*04:13.840- 04:17.140* :  Earlier in the day, two Israeli women were also handed over.
*04:17.740- 04:21.920* :  Thirty more Palestinian prisoners are due to be released from Israeli jails in return.
*04:22.700- 04:26.760* :  I heard more about all of this on Thursday evening from our correspondent Paul Adams,
*04:26.760- 04:27.580* :  who's in Jerusalem.
*04:27.960- 04:35.540* :  This is the latest and potentially the last group of hostages to be released in this phase.
*04:35.960- 04:42.060* :  A total of eight, two were released earlier, and additional six have just crossed into Israel.
*04:42.060- 04:47.400* :  So that completes the expected hostage release for tonight.
*04:47.400- 04:57.020* :  And that sets the scene probably in the coming hour or two for the release of around 30 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
*04:57.020- 05:02.320* :  So that's a successful seventh exchange of hostages and prisoners.
*05:02.320- 05:08.000* :  But as you just said, as things stand on the seventh and final day of this temporary truce,
*05:08.000- 05:09.960* :  that's it for now as far as things stand.
*05:10.660- 05:17.200* :  Well, we have not got any word at the moment of any further extension of the truce.
*05:17.380- 05:25.200* :  There was a slight suggestion on one of the Israeli networks that another 24 hour truce might be available.
*05:25.200- 05:31.460* :  Our impression from the Hamas side is that the chances are low of that happening.
*05:31.460- 05:34.000* :  We may not know that for several hours yet.
*05:34.000- 05:40.960* :  It wasn't until around just before seven o'clock this morning, Israel time that we knew that even today's exchange was going to take place.
*05:41.560- 05:43.760* :  So, you know, let's not write it off just yet.
*05:44.260- 05:47.320* :  But with the last group of hostages to emerge tonight,
*05:47.320- 05:54.420* :  we now think that all the children who were snatched on October the seventh have now been accounted for,
*05:55.220- 05:57.780* :  accept the two little bebass boys,
*05:58.320- 06:04.800* :  the four-year-old and the ten-month-old who Hamas said yesterday they believed were dead.
*06:05.440- 06:08.260* :  We haven't still not got any confirmation of that.
*06:08.940- 06:15.680* :  But I don't think anyone is in Israel is expecting to see them emerge alive.
*06:16.300- 06:18.780* :  Can I just talk to you about Anthony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State.
*06:18.820- 06:20.260* :  He's been in Israel most of the day.
*06:20.260- 06:22.700* :  He met with Benjamin Netanyahu yet again.
*06:23.160- 06:25.600* :  Is there any kind of subtle shift in the U.S. position?
*06:25.640- 06:32.060* :  I mean, this statement that the protection of civilians must be ensured before military operations restart.
*06:32.160- 06:33.600* :  Or has that always been the start?
*06:34.000- 06:40.700* :  No, I think this is the most public and obvious statement of American intent that we have seen so far.
*06:40.700- 06:45.760* :  There have been mutterings from unnamed U.S. officials in the papers in the last few days.
*06:45.760- 06:49.500* :  But here was Anthony Blinken standing on Israeli soil saying,
*06:50.100- 06:54.800* :  look, Israel, if you're going to go back to war in the southern Gaza Strip,
*06:54.800- 06:58.940* :  as everyone expects Israel to do, then here's how you're going to do it.
*06:58.940- 07:05.060* :  You're going to have a plan before you even start a humanitarian civilian protection plan
*07:05.060- 07:11.300* :  with what he called clearly and precisely designated areas of central and southern Gaza
*07:11.300- 07:13.700* :  where civilians can be out of the line of fire.
*07:14.120- 07:18.760* :  That's way beyond the single safe area that the Israelis have been talking about
*07:19.300- 07:20.140* :  in recent weeks.
*07:20.720- 07:25.240* :  And then when the fighting comes, he says it must not target critical infrastructure,
*07:25.260- 07:28.860* :  including crucially hospitals and water facilities.
*07:28.940- 07:36.080* :  Large numbers of people must not be forced to move, as we saw in the northern Gaza Strip.
*07:36.400- 07:39.020* :  In other words, he's saying, if you're going to do this,
*07:39.480- 07:41.800* :  you, one of the most powerful militaries in the world,
*07:41.800- 07:45.720* :  you can do it while minimizing harm to innocent civilians.
*07:45.720- 07:48.960* :  And we, your American allies, will be watching.
*07:49.540- 07:51.420* :  Paul Adams reporting from Jerusalem.
*07:51.420- 07:54.660* :  Well, let's step away from the war in Israel and Gaza now.
*07:54.660- 07:57.720* :  But stay in the Middle East because the warnings are stark,
*07:57.720- 08:02.060* :  but the pressure is climbing as world leaders gather in that region
*08:02.060- 08:05.160* :  for the annual UN conference on climate change.
*08:05.600- 08:09.780* :  The COP28 meeting, as it's known, got underway in the UAE
*08:09.780- 08:14.100* :  with a renewed call for urgency from the UN's meteorological organization.
*08:14.640- 08:17.200* :  It said this year is set to be the hottest on record.
*08:17.920- 08:21.320* :  Now, in the next few minutes, we're going to hear about how three countries
*08:21.320- 08:23.180* :  are dealing with the impact of climate change.
*08:23.720- 08:26.960* :  But first, an agreement was unveiled on day one of the conference
*08:26.960- 08:31.700* :  for richer nations to provide funds to poorer or less developed countries
*08:31.700- 08:34.900* :  to help them deal with the impact of things like severe weather.
*08:35.380- 08:38.700* :  The loss and damage fund, as it's known, is worth several hundred million dollars.
*08:39.200- 08:43.220* :  The head of the talks in Dubai, Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaba hailed the deal.
*08:43.760- 08:48.000* :  That we have been able to achieve such significant milestone
*08:48.520- 08:52.200* :  and the first day of this call is unprecedented.
*08:53.240- 08:54.080* :  This is historic.
*08:55.160- 08:59.000* :  Well, our environment correspondent, Matt McGraw, is at the COP meeting in Dubai
*08:59.000- 09:00.820* :  and he told me more about the new agreement.
*09:01.240- 09:04.640* :  It's something that developing countries have been campaigning for for 30 years.
*09:04.640- 09:07.700* :  It's essentially a fund that will help them to cope with the impacts
*09:07.700- 09:11.620* :  they're experiencing from climate change related weather events right now.
*09:12.140- 09:15.440* :  At the moment, a lot of developing countries do get climate finance
*09:15.440- 09:20.280* :  but it mainly goes to help them to transition away from using coal oil and gas,
*09:20.580- 09:24.180* :  help them build wind tunnels or wind turbines and solar panels.
*09:24.180- 09:26.860* :  It also helps them to build seawalls and other defenses
*09:26.860- 09:29.140* :  so it helps them to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
*09:29.340- 09:32.260* :  It doesn't help them with the impacts of climate change right now
*09:32.720- 09:35.200* :  and that's something that's been a sore point for a long time.
*09:35.200- 09:39.520* :  It wasn't even allowed to be discussed at COP meetings over the last number of decades.
*09:40.060- 09:44.420* :  Last year that changed and agreement was reached and today in a really surprise move
*09:44.420- 09:49.320* :  countries agreed to set this fund up and get it going and actually to put some money in
*09:49.320- 09:53.960* :  quite a significant chunk of money gone into it today we expect more in the coming days.
*09:55.100- 10:00.220* :  So that's a good start to what's going to be a week's long conference though.
*10:00.220- 10:02.180* :  Tell us, what is the big challenge?
*10:02.180- 10:05.860* :  What is it that some parties won't settle by the time this thing wraps up
*10:05.860- 10:07.720* :  and others are more concerned about?
*10:07.840- 10:11.400* :  The bigger question overarching all this is the future of fossil fuels
*10:11.400- 10:15.620* :  because if you remember back at COP26 and Glasgow we had a first mention
*10:15.620- 10:18.120* :  really of fossil fuels by countries talking about climate
*10:18.500- 10:22.660* :  they talked about getting rid of phasing down on a baited coal.
*10:23.220- 10:27.000* :  Now countries want to go much further they want to get rid of coal oil and gas
*10:27.720- 10:31.980* :  in some time in the future and they want countries to agree to some sort of
*10:32.000- 10:34.260* :  timeline here in meeting in Dubai.
*10:34.260- 10:38.800* :  Now it may not happen but there's a lot of push for it and after what's happened today
*10:38.800- 10:43.160* :  on loss of damage who knows what might happen I think it's certainly
*10:43.160- 10:47.700* :  changed the mood around here it's changed the perception people suddenly see
*10:47.700- 10:50.680* :  things that were almost impossible becoming true so I think
*10:51.260- 10:54.300* :  it would be foolish to write off the chances of
*10:54.700- 10:57.800* :  the end of fossil fuels coming at this particularly meeting.
*10:58.320- 11:01.540* :  It might be a bridge too far as well but I think there'll be a significant push
*11:01.540- 11:06.920* :  to get some language that says fossil fuels really have no long-term future.
*11:07.580- 11:10.720* :  And yet we have a reminder today from the UN's World Meteorological
*11:10.720- 11:15.120* :  Organization talking about a deafening co-coffeany of broken records on
*11:15.120- 11:17.980* :  climate change I mean there's an urgency here isn't there
*11:18.320- 11:22.500* :  is there really a sense that an agreement about fossil fuels five or
*11:22.500- 11:26.400* :  ten years down the line is going to deal with a problem that needs dealing
*11:26.400- 11:28.060* :  with something immediately?
*11:28.720- 11:32.500* :  I think better awareness here and a great motivation by reports like that
*11:32.540- 11:38.060* :  that came out today from the WMO you know it's all about history there's a great sense here
*11:38.340- 11:41.680* :  that things are moving much more much more quickly than they used to you know
*11:42.040- 11:46.540* :  from the Paris Agreement to sign in 2015 the words fossil fuels weren't in it
*11:46.620- 11:50.660* :  here we are eight years later talking about perhaps the end of fossil fuels so
*11:50.900- 11:55.980* :  there's been a significant change you're getting almost 200 countries to agree
*11:56.760- 12:01.700* :  unanimously on the steps forward on climate change and you know we will see I imagine
*12:01.700- 12:06.900* :  the next couple of days a number of other agreements on methane on renewable energy and a number
*12:06.900- 12:11.160* :  of things that may not come up to the top mark in terms of getting really fossil fuels but they'll
*12:11.160- 12:16.240* :  certainly be benchmarks important benchmarks along the way to that what might be an
*12:16.240- 12:21.120* :  inevitability at this stage. Matt McGraw who is at the climate talks in Dubai well as I said
*12:21.120- 12:26.160* :  earlier we are going to hear from all about three countries dealing with the impact of climate
*12:26.460- 12:32.860* :  India is crucial to the global efforts to limit and then lessen carbon emissions but even as
*12:32.860- 12:38.280* :  the summit got underway India confirmed its commitment to coal the dirtiest of the fossil fuels
*12:38.280- 12:43.720* :  as a key source of energy in its future his our business reporter David Woodell with 1.4
*12:43.720- 12:48.940* :  billion people India is now the most populous nation on earth and it's reliant on strong economic
*12:48.940- 12:53.780* :  growth to improve the prosperity of its people for growth that needs power and for power
*12:53.780- 12:59.540* :  it's pledged to continue burning this dirty fossil fuel for years to come India depends on
*12:59.540- 13:04.420* :  coal for nearly three quarters of its energy needs now it's rushing to add 17 gigawatts of
*13:04.420- 13:09.300* :  coal-based power generation capacity to meet a record increase in energy demand that would serve
*13:09.300- 13:14.780* :  many millions of homes India along with China are against any attempt to block construction of
*13:14.780- 13:19.640* :  their coal-fired power stations they argue that historically they've contributed far less to
*13:19.640- 13:24.360* :  global emissions compared to developed countries and a significant portion of India's population
*13:24.360- 13:29.700* :  still lacks access to reliable electricity well next there's Fiji which is one of the most
*13:29.700- 13:34.840* :  vulnerable countries the South Pacific archipelago is made up of more than 300 islands
*13:34.860- 13:40.780* :  Drew Slater who's an environmental activist from Fiji says the effects of climate change are a
*13:40.780- 13:46.460* :  constant threat climate change is the greatest crisis to face us so far it's the greatest crisis
*13:46.460- 13:51.260* :  hitting the Pacific at the moment climate change affects us in many ways there are fast
*13:51.260- 13:57.860* :  onset ways like tropical cyclones saltwater inundation and there are slow onset ways like sea
*13:57.860- 14:05.920* :  level rise those impacts and disasters affect us not only physically our islands but they affect us
*14:05.920- 14:12.120* :  economically our ability to recover our ability to sustain ourselves agriculturally they affect our

*17:03.620- 17:09.700* :  now Brazil is sending military reinforcements to its northern border as tensions rise between its
*17:09.700- 17:15.760* :  neighbours Venezuela and Guiana over a disputed oil rich region Venezuela is holding a referendum

*17:27.820- 17:31.980* :  said his country was sending a further 60 soldiers to the border town of Pakaraiima
*17:32.260- 17:37.260* :  almost doubling its deployment there the ministry of defense said it wanted to avoid any transit
*17:37.260- 17:42.420* :  of Venezuelan soldiers through Brazilian territory Brazilian media reports say there are concerns
*17:42.420- 17:47.200* :  the Venezuelan military could invade as he keeble following Sunday's referendum result
*17:47.720- 17:52.460* :  Guiana's government has called for Caracas to cancel the referendum saying it poses an
*17:52.460- 17:57.900* :  existential threat to the form of British territory but President Nicolas Maduro says it will
*17:57.900- 18:02.180* :  bolster Venezuela's historical claims to the region Warren Bull reporting.
*18:02.960- 18:07.540* :  A court in the United States has reinstated a gag order against the former president Donald
*18:07.540- 18:13.320* :  Trump it means that he is once again banned from speaking out against court staff in his ongoing
*18:13.320- 18:19.820* :  civil fraud trial in New York City. Mr. Trump's lawyers had argued that the order was unconstitutional.
*18:20.360- 18:24.780* :  I asked an ortho-american correspondent Neto Taufic what exactly got Donald Trump in trouble
*18:24.780- 18:30.260* :  in the first place. Quite literally on the second day of this trial this gag order was originally
*18:30.260- 18:37.080* :  imposed because Donald Trump had gone off on his social media platform accusing the judges top
*18:37.080- 18:44.440* :  clerk of political bias of being in a relationship with a Democratic senator Chuck Schumer without
*18:44.440- 18:50.180* :  any evidence of that accusing her of Democratic being a Democratic partisan and so the judge
*18:50.180- 18:56.160* :  imposed this gag order and later extended it to his lawyers as well and Donald Trump was fine
*18:56.160- 19:03.920* :  twice for violating that order having to pay $15,000 and warned that in the future he could be met
*19:03.920- 19:08.580* :  with steeper penalties could even be imprisoned if he continued to violate it. So is he going to
*19:08.580- 19:13.700* :  stay by this Neto? Are they confident he's going to abide by it? Well the judge today said that he
*19:13.700- 19:20.620* :  would be vigorously and rigorously imposing it. So Donald Trump in the past had tried to find
*19:20.620- 19:26.800* :  ways to skirt around it in that brief time when the gag order was paused he continued his attacks on
*19:26.800- 19:31.500* :  the clerk so we'll just have to wait and see how Donald Trump handles this. And just quickly Neto
*19:31.620- 19:35.660* :  if he doesn't abide by it what is the sanction? Well the judge said he would even consider
*19:35.660- 19:42.080* :  potentially imprisonment already his as I said had quite hefty fines $15,000 twice already
*19:42.520- 19:47.120* :  and I should just also note that in court today there was another development just a note from
*19:47.120- 19:52.340* :  the judge that he would issue a verdict in this case at the end of January at the earliest.
*19:52.340- 19:58.640* :  We expect Donald Trump to testify for the defense on December 11th and we will have some closing
*19:58.640- 20:04.240* :  arguments on January 11th and as I say a verdict as early as the end of January. Neto
*20:04.240- 20:10.280* :  topic in New York the United Nations has condemned a ruling by Russia's supreme court that appears
*20:10.280- 20:16.560* :  to ban LGBT activism. The judgment backs a move by the justice department to declare the international
*20:16.560- 20:23.160* :  lesbian gay by sexual and transgender movement as an extremist organization even though no
*20:23.160- 20:28.900* :  such group actually exists. Campaigners in Russia fear the law will be used to jail anyone who
*20:28.900- 20:33.840* :  promotes the rights of sexual and gender minorities. Here's our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg.
*20:34.160- 20:41.640* :  In Moscow I once attended the trial of a man who died three years earlier. I recalled that today
*20:41.660- 20:48.160* :  as Russia's supreme court was deciding whether to ban an organization that doesn't exist.
*20:52.700- 21:00.460* :  The judge declared the international LGBT public movement an extremist organization and banned it
*21:00.460- 21:06.240* :  in Russia even though human rights activists had written to the court to point out that there
*21:06.240- 21:15.420* :  isn't an international LGBT public movement. But what there is now is concern amongst LGBT people here
*21:15.980- 21:22.320* :  that the authorities will use this ruling to punish any form of LGBT activism in Russia.
*21:23.480- 21:30.020* :  There's politics at play here. The state seeks enemies, scapegoats, to divert attention from
*21:30.020- 21:37.920* :  problems at home, NATO, America, LGBT. What's more, ahead of next March's presidential election
*21:37.920- 21:44.380* :  in which Vladimir Putin is expected to run, the Kremlin leader has been making traditional family
*21:44.380- 21:52.540* :  values his thing. LGBT activists like Maxime Goldman who's been supporting transgender and non-binary
*21:52.540- 22:01.780* :  people seen no future for themselves in their own country. I feel completely rejected by
*22:01.780- 22:07.900* :  my own country. The people we put in power are meant to take care of us, but the opposite is
*22:07.900- 22:13.240* :  happening. They're punishing us, they're wiping their feet on us, I'm being forced out.
*22:13.720- 22:20.600* :  Maxime has packed his whole life into one small case and heads to the airport not knowing if you'll
*22:20.600- 22:27.460* :  ever be able to return home. Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. Here in the UK, the author of a new book
*22:27.460- 22:33.540* :  on the British royal family has denied naming two members who allegedly asked about the skin color
*22:33.540- 22:38.840* :  of Prince Harry and Meghan's first child. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have previously
*22:38.840- 22:43.920* :  said a royal asked about their child's skin color while Meghan was pregnant with their son Archie.
*22:44.500- 22:49.200* :  The Dutch version of the journalist Omit Scobie's book Endgame, which identified the royals,
*22:49.200- 22:54.820* :  was pulled from shells almost as soon as it was published three days ago. A royal correspondent
*22:54.820- 23:01.460* :  Johnny Diamond has more. A controversy the palace hoped had been lain to rest has flared up again.
*23:01.900- 23:07.800* :  The English version of Omit Scobie's book about the royal family made no mention as to which
*23:07.800- 23:14.420* :  member of the family is alleged to have inquired after the possible skin color of Meghan's first child.
*23:14.420- 23:21.400* :  But the Dutch version swiftly withdrawn from sale had half a paragraph which included their names.
*23:21.420- 23:25.740* :  Speaking on ITV's this morning, Mr Scobie denied responsibility.
*23:26.220- 23:31.080* :  It's frustrating that now what's going on in the Netherlands with the book that was obviously
*23:31.080- 23:37.660* :  immediately rescinded and is now being reprinted has happened and I'm glad to hear so I had never
*23:37.660- 23:43.280* :  submitted a book that had their names in it. Quite how or why the names were included in
*23:43.280- 23:49.040* :  the Dutch version of the book is not clear. Originally a mistranslation was blamed though the
*23:49.040- 23:55.960* :  publishers now speak simply of an error. The palace remains silent partly for fear of fuelling
*23:55.960- 24:02.040* :  the controversy partly because though the names are swirling around social media most broadcasters
*24:02.040- 24:07.940* :  and newspapers are not publishing them and partly because the issue remains the palace says a private
*24:07.940- 24:15.240* :  family matter. Johnny Diamond now the US car company Tesla is facing a growing showdown with trade unions
*24:15.240- 24:20.940* :  in Sweden in a dispute that is pitting Elon Musk's way of doing business against one of Europe's
*24:20.940- 24:26.640* :  strongest workers movements. A strike by a handful of Tesla mechanics over pain negotiations
*24:27.180- 24:32.200* :  has led to walkouts by workers in other sectors linked to the carmaker which is disrupting
*24:32.200- 24:37.480* :  business in a region where electric vehicles sell very well. I got more from Maddie Savage who's in
*24:37.480- 24:43.360* :  Stockholm. So in Sweden there's a really strong union culture and 90% of workers are covered by what's
*24:43.360- 24:48.420* :  called a collective bargaining agreement which looks into these issues and so a union essentially
*24:48.420- 24:53.940* :  lobbies for your working conditions. The problem is that Tesla has refused to sign one of these
*24:53.940- 24:58.880* :  collective agreements and that's why more than 100 mechanics were reported to have walked out of
*24:58.880- 25:04.600* :  workshops at the end of October and a lot of them still on strike. I spoke to EF Metallica
*25:04.600- 25:09.720* :  a couple of hours ago they told me they believe around 60 workers are still not showing up for work
*25:09.720- 25:14.720* :  and strikes are completely legal in Sweden which means they can essentially carry on doing that
*25:14.720- 25:19.360* :  for as long as they want to. I mean I've seen a quote of Elon Musk head of Tesla describing
*25:19.360- 25:26.280* :  this action as insane but it really does seem to be pitting kind of arch capitalist against Sweden
*25:26.280- 25:32.000* :  and Europe's more embedded union movement and the protections that come with it. I mean who's
*25:32.000- 25:36.300* :  going to budge here? It's really difficult to say I mean it is as you say something of a stalemate
*25:36.380- 25:41.480* :  between two very different ways of doing business when you look at the Swedish model it's all about
*25:41.480- 25:47.860* :  consensus it's about union agreement it's about coming to decisions that everybody is happy with
*25:48.120- 25:53.900* :  whereas Tesla's a much more of an American top down organization. We have seen some legal action
*25:53.900- 26:00.140* :  taking place this week with a Swedish court actually ruling in favor of Tesla and this is because
*26:00.500- 26:06.780* :  other workers started going on sympathy strikes from different industries including postal workers
*26:06.780- 26:12.720* :  who refused to deliver the license plates for Tesla vehicles. So this was quite a complicated
*26:12.720- 26:18.080* :  situation because the Swedish transport agency had an agreement to use this particular carrier
*26:18.080- 26:24.480* :  but now a Swedish court has said that Tesla should be able to collect the plates directly as part
*26:24.480- 26:30.100* :  of a process to try and help them to be able to continue selling Tesla cars in Sweden.
*26:30.240- 26:34.880* :  Can I ask you a bit more about that kind of secondary or or sympathy action as you described it?
*26:34.880- 26:39.260* :  I mean I think that is ostensibly outlawed in the UK and other countries but that that's permitted
*26:39.260- 26:45.620* :  is it and allowed in Sweden. Yes several other unions alongside EF metal and the postal workers
*26:45.620- 26:51.060* :  have organized sympathy strikes that is legal in Sweden and I think it's important to say that
*26:51.060- 26:57.340* :  by the way if you go on strike in Sweden you still get paid and these strong unions like EF metal
*26:57.720- 27:02.700* :  they've told me that they want the situation to be that if these strikes need to continue in
*27:02.700- 27:08.220* :  the long term they can they believe that we could well see others being involved in sympathy strikes
*27:08.600- 27:13.580* :  but others if you follow the Swedish media have said they're less sure about how much of a
*27:13.580- 27:19.140* :  huge impact this has had and we are even seeing some Tesla workers speaking out in the Swedish media
*27:19.140- 27:23.300* :  and saying well they're actually happy with their conditions. Maddie Savage in Stockholm.
