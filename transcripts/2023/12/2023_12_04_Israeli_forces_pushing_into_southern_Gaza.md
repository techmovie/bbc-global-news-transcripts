*01:08.780- 01:12.580* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:12.780- 01:20.020* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson, and in the early hours of Monday 4 December, these are our main stories.
*01:20.620- 01:25.580* :  Israel says it's begun its ground-offensive against Hamas targets in southern Gaza.
*01:26.320- 01:29.540* :  We have the capabilities to do this in the most tarar way,
*01:29.940- 01:35.660* :  and just as we did it strongly and tararly in the north, we're also going to do it now in the southern Gaza Strip.
*01:36.000- 01:41.860* :  It comes as Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are backed by Iran, say they've attacked two ships in the Red Sea.
*01:42.260- 01:48.580* :  This morning, the naval forces at the Yemeni armed forces carried out a targeted operation against two Israeli ships
*01:48.580- 01:52.520* :  in the Papal Mandab Strait. The first ship was targeted with a naval missile,
*01:52.520- 01:55.020* :  and the second ship with a naval drone.
*01:55.920- 02:00.900* :  This criticism of the head of the UN Climate Summit in Dubai, following revelations
*02:00.900- 02:06.920* :  that he cast doubt on the world's ability to phase out fossil fuels without affecting living standards.
*02:09.920- 02:15.760* :  Also in this podcast, a leading campaigner for democracy in Hong Kong, Agnes Chao, flees to Canada,
*02:16.340- 02:17.000* :  and in Wales.
*02:17.580- 02:21.720* :  A police officer who was walking past just happened to spot this thing in their garden
*02:22.220- 02:24.040* :  and decided he didn't really like the look of it.
*02:24.300- 02:27.640* :  An hour later, they were told the bomb squad would be there in the morning to get rid of it.
*02:32.500- 02:39.060* :  Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip have continued to intensify since the ceasefire broke down on Friday.
*02:39.660- 02:45.000* :  Now Israel has confirmed that its ground troops have expanded their incursion into the south of the territory.
*02:45.540- 02:49.460* :  The head of the military, Heresy Helevi, said they'd been there since Saturday,
*02:50.020- 02:54.980* :  and their operation would be no less powerful than the one carried out in northern Gaza.
*02:59.940- 03:03.040* :  We have the capabilities to do this in the most thorough way,
*03:03.460- 03:06.940* :  and just as we did it strongly and thoroughly in the northern Gaza Strip,
*03:07.300- 03:10.040* :  we're also going to do it now in the southern Gaza Strip,
*03:10.300- 03:13.800* :  and we continue to secure our accomplishments in the northern Gaza Strip.
*03:14.200- 03:17.580* :  The UN Refugee Chief has warned that Israel's renewed campaign,
*03:17.580- 03:20.100* :  which follows the breakdown of a week-long truce,
*03:20.480- 03:25.300* :  is pushing the population in Gaza into an increasingly narrow corner of the territory.
*03:26.000- 03:31.520* :  And the language from the aid agencies still working in southern Gaza is becoming increasingly desperate.
*03:32.180- 03:35.960* :  James Alder is a spokesman for the UN Children's Agency UNICEF,
*03:36.240- 03:38.260* :  and is in the southern city of Han Unis.
*03:38.760- 03:42.400* :  Many are well aware that they are moving to a place with no water,
*03:42.840- 03:45.100* :  no shelter, no sanitation.
*03:45.640- 03:48.960* :  In shelters here, it's about one toilet for 400 people.
*03:49.440- 03:52.540* :  You go somewhere else, and it's no toilets for 4,000 people.
*03:52.540- 03:55.760* :  So, as a doctor has said to me, we have the attacks from the sky.
*03:55.760- 03:58.200* :  The next phase of this will be death from disease.
*03:58.300- 04:01.240* :  The cynical narrative, if you're perfectly honest, nowhere has been saved,
*04:01.620- 04:05.360* :  and to send people into places where previously they've been bombed anyway,
*04:05.360- 04:08.300* :  and there are absolutely none of the essentials that they need
*04:08.300- 04:10.460* :  is moving people on a chess board.
*04:11.200- 04:14.260* :  A senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister, Mark Raghav,
*04:14.580- 04:18.520* :  said the IDF was taking steps to avoid civilian casualties.
*04:19.120- 04:23.840* :  We're making a maximum effort, maybe, even unprecedented in similar circumstances.
*04:23.840- 04:30.060* :  It's not the entire city of Han Unis, which is going to be susceptible to combat operations.
*04:30.060- 04:34.580* :  We've designated specific neighborhoods, and we've given advance warning to the people
*04:34.580- 04:37.620* :  in those neighborhoods, the civilians, to please leave.
*04:37.620- 04:40.820* :  We've allocated special safer zones for them to go to,
*04:41.380- 04:44.280* :  and the hope is that we won't see civilians caught up in the crossfire
*04:44.280- 04:46.940* :  between the Israeli defense forces and the Hamas terrorists.
*04:47.580- 04:52.280* :  I got the latest on military developments from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams.
*04:52.860- 04:58.280* :  General Herzzy Halavi this evening has said that the IDF are conducting ground operations
*04:58.280- 05:01.660* :  in the southern Gaza Strip, and had been since yesterday morning.
*05:01.660- 05:07.220* :  He said that Hamas commanders would meet the IDF everywhere in a very strong way.
*05:07.220- 05:12.580* :  This comes after reports of tanks and troops being seen north-east of the city of Han Unis,
*05:12.920- 05:18.000* :  suggesting that the Israelis are pushing in from the nearby Israeli board-defense,
*05:18.620- 05:23.460* :  perhaps in an effort to cut off another chunk of the Gaza Strip just as they did in the north.
*05:24.360- 05:30.640* :  This comes as UN officials are warning, aren't they, of the hardship already faced by many Gaza's?
*05:30.980- 05:35.000* :  And the Americans too urging Israel to mitigate civilian casualties.
*05:35.440- 05:36.480* :  What's Israel saying about that?
*05:36.980- 05:40.040* :  Well, these warnings are coming thick and fast, but at the moment,
*05:40.040- 05:44.120* :  all the indications are that Israel is determined to press ahead.
*05:44.120- 05:47.980* :  And you heard from Mark Regev there a suggestion that the Israelis believe
*05:47.980- 05:55.300* :  that what they are offering to the citizens of the Gaza Strip is a more precise way of getting out of harm's way.
*05:55.300- 05:59.240* :  But we spent the last couple of days trying to find out from Gaza's,
*05:59.320- 06:03.280* :  what they think about these new maps that have been distributed throughout the Gaza Strip.
*06:03.280- 06:05.400* :  And frankly, they seem confused.
*06:05.400- 06:11.520* :  What they can tell from those maps is the areas that the Israelis are saying are not safe,
*06:11.520- 06:14.820* :  but it is not clear to them which areas are safe.
*06:15.040- 06:21.000* :  And because the Israeli armed forces reserved the right to hit high-value Hamas targets,
*06:21.600- 06:25.980* :  wherever they are in the Gaza Strip, then there is always the likelihood or the possibility
*06:25.980- 06:31.480* :  that civilians will find themselves in areas outside these designated danger areas,
*06:32.020- 06:33.780* :  but nevertheless subject to airstrikes.
*06:33.880- 06:37.800* :  And I think the aid agencies regard it as frankly inadequate.
*06:38.540- 06:42.420* :  And you have to bear in mind that we're talking about the southern two-thirds of the Gaza Strip,
*06:42.420- 06:45.500* :  which basically now include most of the civilian population.
*06:46.020- 06:47.420* :  Poll Adams in Jerusalem.
*06:48.240- 06:52.660* :  Meanwhile, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court says civilians in Gaza
*06:52.660- 06:57.240* :  must be given access to food, water, and medical supplies without delay.
*06:57.300- 07:03.480* :  Karim Khan has visited Israel and the occupied West Bank at the request of relatives of Israeli victims
*07:03.900- 07:05.640* :  of the Hamas attacks in October.
*07:06.260- 07:08.360* :  A correspondent in the Hague Anaholligan reports.
*07:08.900- 07:14.680* :  Karim Khan visited two of the Kabut's targeted by Hamas and the site of the Nova Music Festival.
*07:14.680- 07:17.340* :  He described scenes of calculated cruelty.
*07:17.340- 07:22.800* :  Mr. Khan said the killings and abductions represented some of the most serious international crimes
*07:22.800- 07:25.380* :  and had shocked the conscience of humanity.
*07:26.100- 07:32.580* :  He said hostages cannot be treated as human shields or bargaining chips and again called for their immediate release.
*07:33.380- 07:39.260* :  The ICC prosecutor also emphasized a profound concern with what he described as a significant increase
*07:39.260- 07:44.020* :  in attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank
*07:44.520- 07:48.980* :  and underlined that the international court is continuing to investigate these incidents
*07:49.000- 07:51.400* :  with focus and urgency.
*07:53.340- 07:58.220* :  An American warship on patrol in the Red Sea has found itself caught up in the widening
*07:58.220- 08:00.880* :  regional shockwaves of the conflict in Gaza.
*08:01.480- 08:05.960* :  The Pentagon issued a statement saying the USS Kani had shot down a drone
*08:06.040- 08:09.960* :  that had been launched from an area of Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels.
*08:09.960- 08:14.740* :  It added that there had been four attacks in the area against three commercial ships
*08:14.740- 08:19.960* :  sailing in international waters and that it had no doubt Iran had enabled the attacks.
*08:20.520- 08:22.940* :  For their part, the Houthis issued this statement.
*08:25.620- 08:31.020* :  This morning, the naval forces of the Yemeni armed forces with the help of God Almighty
*08:31.540- 08:36.220* :  carried out a targeted operation against two Israeli ships in the Papal mandab straight.
*08:36.860- 08:41.280* :  The first ship was targeted with a naval missile and the second ship with a naval drone.
*08:42.040- 08:47.460* :  The Yemeni armed forces continued to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red and Arab seas
*08:48.180- 08:52.600* :  until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip.
*08:55.440- 08:58.200* :  I'm at least analyst Sebastian Asher, tell me more.
*08:58.700- 09:02.480* :  As we just heard, the Houthis issued this statement and they named the ships.
*09:02.580- 09:04.660* :  They said the unity explorer at number nine.
*09:04.660- 09:06.700* :  What we've heard since then is from the Israelis.
*09:06.700- 09:10.560* :  The Israelis have said that they have no connection to Israel whatsoever.
*09:10.780- 09:14.180* :  This is a pattern we've seen several times in the past few weeks.
*09:14.200- 09:19.120* :  The Houthis have said that they are determined to attack any ships which have any relationship
*09:19.440- 09:21.000* :  with Israel that are within their reach.
*09:21.120- 09:24.220* :  The USS Kani is there in the region to protect the shipping.
*09:24.800- 09:25.620* :  It responded.
*09:25.620- 09:31.300* :  The USS Kani has already been involved several times in these past few weeks in those sorts of operations.
*09:32.060- 09:34.820* :  So this seems like an incident which is in a continuum.
*09:34.820- 09:39.080* :  Certainly, the Houthis are trying to step it up, but at the moment I don't think they've crossed a threshold.
*09:39.920- 09:40.820* :  Sebastian Asher.
*09:41.820- 09:46.840* :  Ministers for more than 60 countries have been meeting at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai
*09:46.840- 09:50.500* :  to discuss the health challenges posed by global warming.
*09:50.500- 09:56.480* :  More than 120 countries have endorsed the annual conference's first-ever health declaration
*09:56.520- 10:02.060* :  which acknowledges what can be done to reduce the impact of climate change on health.
*10:02.660- 10:06.920* :  Our global health correspondent, Tulip Misambra, is at the summit and sent us this report.
*10:07.680- 10:14.260* :  One by one, health ministers from dozens of countries stood up and talked about the impact of climate change on their people
*10:14.700- 10:17.080* :  and what they're doing to try and mitigate against it.
*10:17.400- 10:23.180* :  Heat stress, air pollution and the spread of disease were all said to be made worse by our warming planet.
*10:23.780- 10:30.300* :  Those who spoke most passionately were from countries that have contributed the least to climate change, but are at the most risk.
*10:30.300- 10:37.880* :  The first-ever health declaration, championed by countries including the UK, recognizes the need for stronger health systems
*10:38.360- 10:45.880* :  and acknowledges the positive impact climate policies can have on health, such as providing cleaner air and safer drinking water.
*10:46.400- 10:55.080* :  The declaration is not legally binding, but health is now formally recognised as an important part of negotiations around climate change.
*10:55.780- 11:03.480* :  Sunday also saw controversy over comments by the summit's own head, Sultan Al-Jaba, from the United Arab Emirates.
*11:04.040- 11:11.640* :  It came during a testy exchange with the former Irish President Mary Robinson at an online forum in the run-up to the summit.
*11:12.260- 11:16.680* :  She demanded that Abu Dhabi led the way on ending fossil fuel extraction.
*11:17.300- 11:18.800* :  This is Mr Al-Jaba's response.
*11:25.300- 11:30.880* :  We allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.
*11:31.740- 11:40.680* :  The Sheikh, who's also chief executive of Abu Dhabi's national oil company, insisted he was committed to ending the world's reliance on fossil fuels.
*11:41.180- 11:43.640* :  But only if it's done in a sustainable way.
*12:04.800- 12:12.420* :  The BBC's former science editor David Shukman is at the summit in his current role as an independent climate consultant.
*12:12.420- 12:17.720* :  He was on the fringe of the main event when news broke of Sultan Al-Jaba's comments.
*12:18.480- 12:24.500* :  It was an extraordinary moment. I was at a briefing by some very respected polar scientists.
*12:24.620- 12:36.240* :  We're explaining the latest impact of warming on the ice sheets, what it means for life in the oceans and above all for the rise of sea level, which is incredibly important for coastal cities.
*12:36.240- 12:46.660* :  And while they were doing this, someone noticed on their phone the breaking news that Sultan Al-Jaba had said, as you say, there's no science requiring fossil fuels to be faced out.
*12:46.660- 13:01.540* :  Well, we have known for 150 years there's been an accumulation of science over that time, showing that more and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will trap more heat, raise temperatures, melt even more ice, drive up sea level.
*13:01.540- 13:10.380* :  So scientists are absolutely appalled at this. Even before this dropped, 400 of them had signed a letter demanding the phase out of fossil fuels as soon as possible.
*13:10.420- 13:13.640* :  And I think what we're just reading right now will reinforce that.
*13:14.140- 13:24.440* :  Climate consultant, David Shukman. And staying with COP28, Miyamoto, the Prime Minister of Barbados, has emerged as the champion of the smaller island nations,
*13:24.440- 13:30.060* :  vulnerable to the impact of climate change from tropical storms and rising sea levels.
*13:30.700- 13:39.400* :  One of their biggest challenges is to finance infrastructure to protect against the impact of climate change and to get insurance against the damage.
*13:40.040- 13:44.300* :  Our climate editor Justin Rolatt caught up with Miyamoto at the conference.
*13:44.620- 13:54.040* :  In our regions, we are closely becoming uninsurable with the fact that insurance manages risk, low risk, medium risk, but the climate crisis is almost certainty.
*13:54.300- 14:01.080* :  So where does that leave us? And we've seen the evidence of it with the withdrawal of insurance companies in California and the right in fire.
*14:01.300- 14:13.340* :  We've seen companies in Florida start to retreat, so therefore you need to be able to restructure the entire financial system to ensure that there's far more access to longer-term capital at cheaper rates if we're going to...
*14:13.340- 14:16.880* :  to choose between people and planet. Why would that be so transformative?
*14:17.100- 14:22.860* :  Let's take your country, UK. When you had to fight World War I, you borrowed money in 1914 and 1917.
*14:23.620- 14:30.680* :  You soon realized by 1932 that you couldn't repay the debt that you borrowed for fighting the war while borrowing for reconstruction.
*14:30.720- 14:35.200* :  And you changed it into a perpetual debt that you never paid off until 2014.
*14:35.300- 14:47.980* :  If that was appropriate for a leading industrial country in the 20th century, which you were, can you imagine how much more necessary it is for countries that are developing and don't have access to money that is longer than 15 or 20 years?
*14:48.340- 14:59.980* :  In the markets and the development banks need to be able to be looking at 30 and 40-year money so that we can have the time to have the growth that we need when we invest in education, that we need when we invest in healthcare.
*15:00.460- 15:06.160* :  Have the space to do all of that while investing in coastal infrastructure. We can't do it with short-term money.
*15:06.820- 15:08.900* :  Development and human growth is long-term.
*15:09.040- 15:12.100* :  But the money on the table may reach the effect at the moment, isn't it?
*15:12.280- 15:13.560* :  It's not enough. It's very difficult.
*15:15.280- 15:25.180* :  It's a start. But we need to have larger amounts if oil and gas companies which earn $4 trillion in profits last year give 5%, which is 200 billion.
*15:25.180- 15:28.820* :  That's significantly more than anything that's any loss and damage fund today.
*15:28.820- 15:35.620* :  If we agree that every person who travels domestically or internationally says, look, I want to play my part in saving the planet.
*15:35.840- 15:39.880* :  I'll put $5 in domestic travel. I'll put $10 in international travel.
*15:39.880- 15:41.800* :  And if you're traveling for a glass, put $100.
*15:41.980- 15:46.280* :  We have $7 trillion in value of global goods and shipping across the world.
*15:46.680- 15:49.220* :  But yet we don't have a mechanism for extracting value.
*15:49.220- 15:53.160* :  If you put 1% on every container, that's $70 billion.
*15:53.600- 15:59.680* :  We haven't touched your finance companies yet in the banks who need to be touched because they provide the oxygen for all of this.
*15:59.860- 16:02.840* :  And we haven't touched equally the insurance companies.
*16:02.840- 16:05.720* :  But here's the deal. All of it can go into loss and damage.
*16:06.040- 16:08.140* :  Because loss and damage is after the damage.
*16:08.140- 16:15.280* :  We need much more in adaptation, which is where we're working with the World Bank and the IMF to restructure and to stretch their balance sheet.
*16:15.300- 16:23.500* :  But we also have to confront the geopolitics of the shareholding and to determine whether that is not a constraint in factor in the recapitalization of the banks.
*16:24.120- 16:28.400* :  The Prime Minister of Barbados Miyamoto speaking there to Justin Rolatt.
*16:29.260- 16:35.740* :  A leading campaigner for democracy in Hong Kong has flagged to Canada and says she will not return to Hong Kong.
*16:36.280- 16:39.880* :  Agnes Chow says that way should be free from the threat of detention.
*16:40.000- 16:43.440* :  Aurasia-Pacific regional editor Michi Bristo has the details.
*16:44.280- 16:48.260* :  Despite her youth, Agnes Chow is a veteran democracy campaigner.
*16:48.760- 16:55.300* :  She spent six months in jail for taking part in protests against the Chinese government in Hong Kong in 2019.
*16:55.300- 17:02.960* :  She'd also been accused, although not charged, of colluding with foreign forces and was on police bail.
*17:03.560- 17:09.820* :  Despite that, the authorities in Hong Kong had allowed her to travel to Toronto and Canada in September to study.
*17:10.480- 17:17.340* :  She's now announced on her 27th birthday that she won't be returning to Hong Kong, perhaps ever.
*17:18.000- 17:23.280* :  Since China tightened its control over Hong Kong, most democracy activists have fled,
*17:23.780- 17:25.620* :  are in prison or remain silent.
*17:25.620- 17:31.160* :  In a social media post she said the decision to stay in Canada had not been taken easily.
*17:31.880- 17:35.320* :  But she said she had to consider her physical and mental well-being.
*17:35.840- 17:36.480* :  Michi Bristo.
*17:39.180- 17:41.260* :  Still to calm on the global news podcast?
*17:41.300- 17:47.760* :  Tabby McTatt was a buskers cat, with a meow that was loud and strong.
*17:49.600- 17:54.520* :  The two of them sang of this and that, and people threw coins in the old checked hat.
*17:55.180- 18:02.060* :  A new animation based on a story by the creators of the Graffalo and other much-loved children's books.
*18:09.320- 18:11.680* :  Let's return now to our main story.
*18:12.260- 18:20.640* :  After three days of intense bombardment, the Israeli military says its ground offensive against her mass targets in southern Gaza is underway.
*18:21.360- 18:27.600* :  The announcement came on the day an interfaith peace vigil for Israel and Gaza was held here in central London.
*18:28.260- 18:35.600* :  Those gathered spoke out against both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, while mourning those killed in the conflict.
*18:36.380- 18:40.340* :  Organizers say it was the biggest mass vigil of its kind in the UK.
*18:41.100- 18:47.960* :  The BBC's Megan Owen spoke to Palestinian peace activist Hamza Awad and Israeli peace activist Megan Inon,
*18:47.960- 18:51.400* :  who both have family members killed in the war.
*18:51.700- 18:58.300* :  Many people showed up and people were hungry to hear such visions and such stands in this hard times,
*18:58.300- 19:05.520* :  because people don't know how to deal with this conflict, how to not choose the side of hate and still be involved, and we shot them.
*19:05.520- 19:10.980* :  It's good that we are paying attention to this conflict, but they should never let hate come to the way,
*19:10.980- 19:16.400* :  because no amount of hate will assure any father or any family back home, both in Israel and Palestine.
*19:16.400- 19:22.360* :  And if they can come together, then this gives hope to people that one day there will be peace there.
*19:22.640- 19:26.780* :  And you've both got very personal reasons for being here. You both had family members killed in the conflict.
*19:27.280- 19:28.900* :  Again, what drives you to be here today?
*19:29.200- 19:38.580* :  Hamza has a son. My son is almost seven. What drives me is that I want they to grow up not hating anyone, not fearing anyone,
*19:39.000- 19:43.660* :  and be able to play together by human beings and enjoy each other's company.
*19:43.660- 19:49.720* :  And that's what drives us. And for that to happen, we have to make the bridge today, so they will have a better future.
*19:50.460- 19:53.180* :  We love our kids, and that's the world we want them to grow up in.
*19:53.480- 19:58.140* :  Hamza, you flew to the UK especially for this vigil. What was so different about this for you?
*19:58.740- 20:07.200* :  In these dark times, it's so easy to lose hope, because you see the amount of hatred, you see the amount of bloodshed when I heard about this happening.
*20:07.640- 20:14.940* :  I knew this is where I belonged, because if anything would help my people, and there's really people that I know very well,
*20:14.940- 20:23.660* :  and I'm close to, is people coming for peace, for the future of humanity, in Israel and Palestine, and all over the world, because humanity is one.
*20:23.660- 20:32.440* :  Here I know I'm not harming anyone. Any other stands will not help my people, will not help the other people, and I'm not going to waste my energy there.
*20:32.640- 20:40.140* :  I think one of the things that was most striking about today's vigil was the lack of placards. Again, why were you encouraging people not to bring them today?
*20:40.440- 20:49.340* :  So, talking about our kids again, you don't educate a child to have the core values you want, respecting other human beings, other people from other faith and backgrounds.
*20:49.340- 20:56.880* :  You don't educate a child by a placard or a slogan. It takes time and effort, you have to move step by step, you have to get the support of your community.
*20:57.300- 21:11.380* :  In the same way, if we want to achieve peace, any kind of a clever slogan is not going to do it. We need to work hard day in day out, put time and effort. If we want to have a solution, we want to have peace, step by step.
*21:11.640- 21:15.420* :  I hope it's going to come sooner than later, but it's going to come. It's inevitable.
*21:15.800- 21:21.100* :  It's a powerful image seeing both of you stood beside each other. What message does this send to the world?
*21:21.480- 21:35.140* :  It's possible. It's not easy, but it's our duty, as he said, for our children. My family grew up in conflict, I grew up in conflict, and I see now my son is going even to a worse conflict than we ever knew in the past.
*21:35.320- 21:42.380* :  If we don't remind ourselves and people of our humanity, then which word we are giving to our children? We're betraying them, actually.
*21:42.380- 21:49.420* :  I'm not sure his future will be better, but he will know that his father have done something, hoping for a better future.
*21:50.000- 21:53.980* :  Again, what's the feeling after today's vigil for you? Is it hope?
*21:54.260- 22:07.020* :  I think I feel supported. It's knowing that you're not alone, and I think coming here together and hearing different voices, a large community getting together, hoping for a better future, and doing it together.
*22:07.020- 22:15.440* :  It just gives us support and hope that we can do it, and I completely agree with Hamza. The point is that to show that it's possible, and it is possible.
*22:16.300- 22:23.680* :  Palestinian peace activist Hamza Awad and Israeli peace activist, Megan Inon, speaking there to Megan Owen.
*22:23.680- 22:36.000* :  A respected Swedish think tank says, total revenues for the world's biggest arms companies actually fell by 3.5% last year, despite Russia launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
*22:36.000- 22:48.060* :  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Sipri, said this was largely due to backlogs in fulfilling earlier orders and difficulties some major manufacturers faced in ramping up production.
*22:48.060- 22:58.040* :  Then he ever had reports. Sipri said the world's biggest 100 arms companies sold nearly $600 billion worth of weapons and military services last year.
*22:58.840- 23:10.500* :  He could have been more with global tensions fueling a surge in orders, but COVID-related issues such as labor shortages and disruption to supply chains meant some manufacturers struggle to respond fast.
*23:11.500- 23:14.780* :  Some expect their revenues to rise significantly in the years ahead.
*23:15.600- 23:28.580* :  Not all companies faced such a lag. The Turkish producer of a type of drone used heavily by Ukraine in the early stages of the war saw revenues saw, as did an Israeli company that manufactures anti-tank missile launchers.
*23:29.320- 23:49.240* :  Overall, half of the revenues were brought in by US companies. All the top five biggest manufacturers are American. Companies in China, the next most significant nation, accounted for 18%. Sipri named China, along with India and Turkey, as being among the countries that are pushing hard to be self-reliant in arms production.
*23:49.300- 24:06.780* :  For a second consecutive year, the combined revenues of arms companies in Asia and Oceania outstripped those of Europe. The institute did acknowledge difficulties in getting a full picture of the situation in Russia, but moaning what it called diminishing transparency in the industry there.
*24:08.660- 24:22.620* :  Next to Ghana, where the fishing industry is under threat, the sector employs more than 200,000 people and provides a living to millions more, but rising sea levels have destroyed dozens of coastal fishing communities.
*24:22.620- 24:31.600* :  With hundreds more still at risk, Natalia Zwa went to meet a group of female climate pioneers who are helping to support struggling businesses.
*24:35.480- 24:47.480* :  Stretching along the Gulf of Guinea coast and out into the mouth of the Volta River is a narrow sandbank, behind it a lagoon and hundreds of kilometers of wetlands.
*24:49.400- 24:56.720* :  It's lined with the abandoned shells of wooden buildings. This is all that remains of fruverme village.
*24:57.600- 25:09.280* :  Moses Akali was the village's chief fisherman. He takes us out into the Gulf. Not all the destruction is visible. He shows us where his home once stood.
*25:18.260- 25:32.280* :  It's been four years since extreme weather caused the tidal waves which claimed fruverme. The residents were forced to relocate. Many found themselves here in the neighboring community of Akokaji.
*25:33.400- 25:43.780* :  In this fishing reliant community, labour is divided. As a man patrols the Gulf, Akokaji's female residents prepare the fish for market.
*25:46.560- 25:51.720* :  This is what we are used to. If we move, we don't know what we're going to do for a living.
*25:52.760- 25:56.840* :  Susanukto Soweto is married to Moses. She moved here with him.
*26:00.420- 26:09.140* :  When the tidal waves flooded our homes, we watched helplessly. We don't have money to build a concrete house. We're in God's hands.
*26:09.680- 26:17.640* :  Damage to property isn't the only concern. Fish stocks along Ghana's coast have been significantly reduced in recent years.
*26:18.500- 26:22.060* :  In part, linked to the warming of the coast's shallow waters.
*26:28.360- 26:36.900* :  At a gathering of fishmongers, they're saying, the fish are hiding the sees is thick in our land. We want the situation tuckled urgently.
*26:37.600- 26:43.240* :  Women fishmongers of Akokaji have banded together to support each other and their families.
*26:43.320- 26:54.160* :  Sipobasa, the chief fishmonger, has set up a cooperative association of local fishmongers designed to help out should another disaster strike.
*26:57.920- 27:01.420* :  The way the support work is that we lend money to the sisters in need.
*27:01.860- 27:05.960* :  For example, if someone's house is destroyed, we can support the person.
*27:06.560- 27:16.100* :  Their association has grown to almost 100 members. But se still fears a tidal event of the same scale which took for vermin.
*27:17.360- 27:20.760* :  Se babasa ended that report by Natalia Zwa.
*27:21.640- 27:29.200* :  Now, any proud gardener knows there's an endless variety of choice when it comes to ornaments to decorate their cherished plot.
*27:29.760- 27:37.140* :  Most people wouldn't include, though, an unexploded bomb alongside any garden, gnomes, water features and pots.
*27:37.680- 27:42.500* :  But unbeknownst to them, that's exactly what a couple from Milford Haven in Wales had been doing.
*27:43.180- 27:49.500* :  Shan and Jeffrey Edwards say the device, which weighed nearly 30 kilos, have been outside their home all their lives.
*27:49.500- 27:51.900* :  The BBC's David Grundy explains.
*27:52.400- 27:58.400* :  This all started on Wednesday evening. Shan and Jeffrey Edwards were at home in Milford Haven in Padwickshire in southwest Wales.
*27:58.900- 28:05.360* :  A police officer who was walking past just happened to spot this thing in their garden and decided he didn't really like the look of it.
*28:05.360- 28:08.500* :  So he knocked on their door and told them he'd have to alert the Ministry of Defence.
*28:08.520- 28:12.500* :  An hour later, they were told the bomb squad would be there in the morning to get rid of it.
*28:12.500- 28:16.060* :  Now, I spoke to Jeffrey and Shan on the phone earlier. He told me he's quite a character.
*28:16.380- 28:22.060* :  He told me he didn't have time for me to go and see him today because they're far too busy putting up their Christmas decorations.
*28:23.300- 28:30.520* :  And what he told me was that Wednesday night was a pretty sleepless night because they were told the whole street might have to be evacuated.
*28:31.060- 28:37.120* :  Now, the bomb disposal unit from Ash Church in Gloucestershire, which is about 160 miles and three hours away by road.
*28:37.220- 28:46.020* :  They arrived the next morning. They did test on what the couple had thought was a dummy and what they found was it was an actually a live bomb which had a tiny amount of charge.
*28:46.020- 28:51.780* :  Jeffrey told me that he told the bomb disposal units we're not leaving the house we're staying here.
*28:51.780- 28:54.380* :  If it goes up, we go up with it.
*28:54.960- 29:00.440* :  So this thing they've been using as an ornament was actually a £64, £29 kilo naval projectile.
*29:00.920- 29:05.560* :  Shan, who's a keen gardener, used to bang a trowel on the bomb to get the soil off it.
*29:05.900- 29:11.500* :  It was taken to a disused quarry about five miles away where it was covered in five tons of sand and then detonated.
*29:12.380- 29:15.800* :  I think that's what's known as an explosive story. They've been granted reporting.
*29:17.100- 29:26.180* :  Now, if you have small children in your life, you may well be familiar with picture books like The Graffalo, Stickman, Room on the Broom, Zorg and The Highway Rat.
*29:26.180- 29:34.520* :  They're all the result of a remarkable creator partnership between the English writer Julia Donaldson and the German illustrator Axel Sheffler.
*29:35.060- 29:38.380* :  The pair are now celebrating thirty years of working together.
*29:38.900- 29:45.060* :  Their latest project is an animated TV adaptation of their best-selling story, Tabby McTatt.
*29:45.600- 29:48.200* :  Our reporter James Alexander has been to meet them.
*29:51.640- 29:55.960* :  The partnership just came about because while I'd written this song called This Question to Squeeze,
*29:55.960- 29:59.700* :  decades ago actually for a children's television program.
*30:00.040- 30:03.460* :  The words of it were made into books so the publisher needed to find and illustrate.
*30:04.020- 30:08.040* :  I think Axel was actually the third choice, the first two turned it down, luckily.
*30:08.620- 30:11.460* :  I see it as teamwork making a picture book.
*30:11.700- 30:12.320* :  Yes, yes.
*30:12.420- 30:17.780* :  I read the text and then it's over to me to develop the characters and then I illustrate it.
*30:18.220- 30:23.060* :  You've got this new animation coming out called Tabby McTatt. It's very lovely.
*30:23.060- 30:23.660* :  Thank you.
*30:23.820- 30:25.160* :  Where did the idea come from?
*30:25.540- 30:34.520* :  Tabby McTatt is a Tabby cat who is also a busker and his busking companion is a guy called Fred.
*30:35.160- 30:37.440* :  They sing in the streets together.
*30:38.020- 30:44.740* :  I used to go busking myself actually and singing and the pavement outside cafes in France and Italy.
*30:45.320- 30:50.380* :  And I love cats and I've got two Tabby cats myself and I say it's very close to my heart.
*30:52.260- 30:57.340* :  Tabby McTatt was a buskers cat with a meow that was loud and strong.
*30:58.980- 31:04.120* :  The two of them sang of this and that and people threw coins in the old checked hat.
*31:04.600- 31:07.180* :  There's a lot of cats in this story, Axel.
*31:07.820- 31:09.460* :  Do you find them easy to draw?
*31:09.920- 31:17.960* :  Well, I've done quite a few cat books and they become my cats kind of like all the creatures I draw and have less to do with what they really like.
*31:17.960- 31:24.860* :  I read somewhere the publisher told you to read draw Tabby McTatt because it thought his teeth looked a bit scary.
*31:25.360- 31:30.000* :  Yes, I drew teeth on the cover and the publisher didn't want teeth.
*31:30.320- 31:33.020* :  So I'm very obedient illustrator, I follow what I'm being told.
*31:33.400- 31:42.260* :  Nobody noticed that the proportions of that cat on the cover are completely crazy because the head is as big as the body and nobody seemed to mind that but the teeth they didn't want.
*31:42.700- 31:55.580* :  I sometimes have to make changes to the script and I'm in Axel's very keen on things being true to nature if there's a book set in the natural world and there's a recent text I've written.
*31:55.580- 32:10.700* :  I'm at a lovely line about swordfish that sword and belugas that blew but Axel said, oh no, this can't work because belugas are only in cold water and I had to change it to blue whales that blew and that didn't sound so good.
*32:11.060- 32:18.980* :  Your books have become part of so many childhoods, so many bedtimes. That must be an amazing feeling.
*32:19.440- 32:26.480* :  Yes, that's completely incredible and it has to pinch oneself to believe it but I think we both don't think about it every day.
*32:26.600- 32:35.240* :  But obviously it's very nice to get the feedback from parents and children and to see how much it means to them. I think we're both very proud of that.
*32:35.460- 32:47.020* :  Yeah, I think if you've got memories, I've certainly got memories of very happy times, like a link up and reading the draws of my own children and it's nice to feel we're feeding into that term I'll experience.
*32:47.020- 32:56.700* :  Just finally, Julia, you've not just written the story for this new animation, you've also written the song, the cat and the busker sing together.
*32:56.700- 33:01.480* :  I wonder if you might just give us a little blast of tabby-mat-tats song to finish with.
*33:02.460- 33:03.940* :  I'll explain that to you later.
*33:26.880- 33:27.960* :  What a note to end on.
*33:30.300- 33:34.120* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:34.500- 33:40.920* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll, the producer was Emma Joseph, the editor as ever is Karen Martin.
*33:41.360- 33:43.400* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and until next time, bye bye.

*34:27.220- 34:29.140* :  Hello, hope you're enjoying the pod you're listening to.
*34:29.140- 34:33.460* :  My name is Justin Webb. I work at the BBC. I'm one of the hosts of America.
*34:33.460- 34:38.200* :  It's a podcast all about American news and politics and society.
*34:38.200- 34:41.280* :  And we have literally just come out of the studio.
*34:41.320- 34:43.700* :  We recorded a really powerful episode.
*34:43.700- 34:49.020* :  A lot of it's about the former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who has died at the age of 100.
*34:49.480- 34:51.020* :  Who is he? What do you actually do?
