*00:25.360- 00:31.360* :  news and politics and society and we have literally just come out of the studio. We recorded
*00:31.360- 00:36.520* :  a really powerful episode. A lot of it's about the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,
*00:36.520- 00:42.340* :  who has died at the age of 100, who is he? What do you actually do? Why was he such an important

*01:22.800- 01:27.660* :  trapped in a collapsed tunnel in India. We speak to our correspondent who was at the scene.
*01:28.200- 01:34.660* :  The joy was really lovely to see because we had spent so many days involved in the story.
*01:39.500- 01:44.680* :  Hello, I'm Harry Bly and this is The Happy Pot, a weekly roundup of uplifting news from around
*01:44.680- 01:49.740* :  the world. In Indonesia, a baby rhinoceros has been born on the island of Samatra,
*01:50.120- 01:56.540* :  boosting hopes the critically endangered species can be saved. They live in deep forest in
*01:56.540- 02:02.340* :  Samatra and they usually isolate it so when they want to meet up with another rhino to breed,
*02:02.920- 02:06.400* :  they actually sing through the forest, which is absolutely fantastic.
*02:07.420- 02:12.820* :  The former Mayor of Vancouver, Sam Sullivan, tells us about testing a set of revolutionary earbuds
*02:12.820- 02:19.100* :  that allow him to control his wheelchair. I said, look, mom, no hands. So I was just doing wheelies
*02:19.100- 02:24.760* :  around my lobby, just exploring, you know, sort of like experiencing all of these new feelings.
*02:25.500- 02:31.560* :  And the grandfather from Britain, who after recovering from COVID-19, took up arm wrestling and became
*02:31.560- 02:37.920* :  a European champion. All that and more to come. Hello, this is John from Save the Rhino International
*02:37.920- 02:42.540* :  and you're listening to The Happy Pot. Hello, my name is Matti Nepetraninkov and you are listening
*02:42.540- 02:47.260* :  to The Happy Pot. Hello, my name is Leonardo Ket and you're listening to Happy Pot.
*02:47.740- 02:54.720* :  Hello, this is William Williamson in Scotland and you're listening to The Happy Pot from the BBC World Service.
*03:00.220- 03:04.580* :  On the 12th of November, part of a tunnel that was being drilled into the Himalayas,
*03:04.700- 03:10.320* :  collapsed, trapping 41 workers inside. What followed was a marathon effort to rescue the
*03:10.320- 03:16.140* :  trapped men. With food, water and oxygen pumped in through a small pipe, heavy machinery air lifted
*03:16.140- 03:22.360* :  to the site in the state of utter a cunt and a group of so-called rat hole miners who were sent
*03:22.360- 03:27.880* :  in towards the end using handheld drills to break through the rock, eventually reaching the men.
*03:28.580- 03:33.880* :  16 days later, on Tuesday the 28th, all 41 workers emerged from the tunnel.
*03:34.380- 03:40.280* :  It's a story which at first looks like a disaster, but instead is one of hope and perseverance.
*03:40.380- 03:44.980* :  Our South Asia correspondent, Samira Hussein, covered this story from the start,
*03:44.980- 03:50.220* :  reporting from the entrance of the collapsed tunnel for eight days straight. I spoke to her from
*03:50.220- 03:57.440* :  Delhi. It was an incredible moment because we had been there for so long and we had gotten
*03:57.440- 04:03.380* :  close a few times. It wasn't sort of the first time like there were moments where everyone thought,
*04:03.380- 04:07.960* :  okay, the rescue is going to happen, it's imminent and then there were just so many technological
*04:07.960- 04:14.020* :  setbacks, so many setbacks with regards to the machinery that finally when you caught word
*04:14.600- 04:19.160* :  that they broke through and that one of the construction workers was coming out. There was cheering,
*04:19.220- 04:30.860* :  there was coloring, there was chanting, clapping. There was someone like giving out sweets and
*04:30.860- 04:36.400* :  they were giving out garlands, I mean it was a real party type atmosphere. What was it like
*04:36.400- 04:43.520* :  to experience the change of atmosphere from that fear and disappointment at some stages to joy?
*04:44.840- 04:51.280* :  The joy was really lovely to see because we had spent so many days involved in this story.
*04:51.880- 04:57.260* :  It was an incredible moment and I think also speaking to the family members who were just waiting
*04:57.260- 05:03.220* :  to be able to see their loved ones. One interview really stuck out for me, which was with this
*05:03.220- 05:09.580* :  gentleman who goes by one name, Jodhri, and he's 50 years old and his son is 22 and he was trapped.
*05:10.500- 05:16.440* :  And I remember asking him early on, what's the first thing that you're going to do when you see
*05:16.440- 05:23.320* :  your son and he sort of stopped and was like, well, you know, I'm obviously going to hug him and
*05:23.320- 05:29.760* :  I'm going to hold him, but it's also something so undescribable at the moment because although he
*05:29.760- 05:36.640* :  had hope, it just felt like it was so far away. And then there was this beautiful picture that
*05:36.640- 05:43.320* :  emerged afterwards of just this man kissing his son on his forehead. I mean, it was just like
*05:43.320- 05:51.000* :  really tender moment captured on camera. It was really quite powerful. And this story at a glance,
*05:51.100- 05:57.160* :  it looked like it could have been disastrous, especially at the beginning. And Samira, as a reporter,
*05:57.160- 06:02.480* :  you've covered stories all over the world. What's it like for you to cover this story that in fact
*06:02.480- 06:07.520* :  had a positive outcome? I mean, it's super great to be able to finally say, oh, look,
*06:07.520- 06:13.000* :  it's good news. In fact, actually, this story, I would say, is great news because not only did
*06:13.000- 06:20.460* :  everybody get out, everybody is safe and healthy. Like no one got sick, no one was injured. You
*06:20.460- 06:27.020* :  couldn't have asked for a better outcome for these 41 construction workers. That was Samira Hussein
*06:27.020- 06:31.900* :  speaking to me from Delhi. And we will share that photo of the father celebrating the safe
*06:31.900- 06:38.980* :  rescue of his son on our socials using hashtag happy pod. A critically endangered Samatren
*06:38.980- 06:44.960* :  rhinoceros has been born in Indonesia's western island of Samatra. This is the second Samatren
*06:44.960- 06:50.300* :  rhino calf to be born in the country this year and a welcome addition to the species which is
*06:50.300- 06:56.760* :  critically endangered. There are fewer than 50 Samatren rhinos left. A female named Delilah
*06:56.760- 07:02.880* :  gave birth to a 25 kilogram calf at a sanctuary in Wei-Cambus National Park in Lampung province
*07:02.880- 07:08.560* :  at the southern tip of Samatra Island. I spoke to John Taylor from Save the Rhino International.
*07:09.100- 07:12.580* :  He told me more about these rhinos and the efforts to preserve the species.
*07:13.760- 07:20.300* :  They are wonderfully, evolutionarily distinct and unique animals that the most close living
*07:20.300- 07:27.760* :  relative of the woolly rhino that used to walk around in Europe. They're small, brown, hairy
*07:28.300- 07:42.960* :  and they sing to each other in the forest. They live in deep forest in Samatra and they usually
*07:42.960- 07:48.480* :  isolate it. So when they want to meet up with another rhino to breed they actually sing through
*07:48.480- 07:59.040* :  the forest which is absolutely fantastic. This rhino, second one that's been born this year. So what
*07:59.040- 08:05.240* :  does that mean for the local population of the Samatra rhino? The Samatren rhinos are critically
*08:05.240- 08:11.620* :  endangered. The IUCNs, the World Conservation Union, did an estimate last year and their
*08:11.620- 08:20.120* :  estimate is between 34 and 47 animals. So to have two births at the sanctuary in Samatra
*08:20.660- 08:25.540* :  is extraordinary. Just these two that have been born in the last two months represent
*08:25.540- 08:32.180* :  5% of the global population of Samatren rhinos. Tell me about the ongoing conservation
*08:32.180- 08:39.100* :  efforts. How are these rhinos being protected? The main problem, the main threat they face now
*08:39.100- 08:45.580* :  is isolation. They've been forced into smaller and smaller fragments of forest. So the government
*08:45.580- 08:51.400* :  of Indonesia is leading a conservation program to try and locate these few remaining animals to
*08:51.400- 08:57.000* :  bring them out of the forest into safe places, into sanctuaries where they can meet other rhinos
*08:57.000- 09:03.140* :  and hopefully start building up their numbers to a point where eventually they can be released
*09:03.140- 09:09.660* :  into safe natural habitat again. Are you confident that the population can recover?
*09:10.520- 09:15.840* :  There is really good hope. The expertise that's been built up in Indonesia is fantastic and this
*09:16.460- 09:22.240* :  record of breeding success is absolutely wonderful news and at the same time there's a lot of
*09:22.240- 09:27.080* :  effort being put into protecting the remaining habitat so that if we can build up the numbers
*09:27.080- 09:33.180* :  enough they can be re-released. There's a lot of hope certainly. There's evidence of other species
*09:33.740- 09:38.180* :  where the numbers have got really low in historical times and with really good conservation
*09:38.180- 09:43.820* :  efforts like this work that's going on in Samatra now, their numbers have been able to build up again
*09:44.280- 09:48.760* :  so there's really strong hope. John Taylor from Save the Rhino International.
*09:49.860- 09:55.380* :  A Vancouver-based tech firm has developed a set of earbuds that its founder hopes offer a far
*09:55.380- 10:01.380* :  simpler and accessible way to operate technology. They're called knacky earbuds and they use
*10:01.380- 10:06.860* :  tiny sensors to pick up the smallest of movements in your head and jaw. These are turned into
*10:06.860- 10:11.680* :  electronic signals that can then be used to control devices through a Bluetooth connection.
*10:12.520- 10:16.880* :  The man behind it is David Segal. He's an American inventor and tech entrepreneur.
*10:17.480- 10:22.840* :  He spent a long time researching brain implants and ways to control tech with one's mind
*10:22.840- 10:28.420* :  but then he came up with this set of earbuds as a simpler non-invasive accessible controller.
*10:29.040- 10:34.600* :  Knacky earbuds have been named one of this year's best inventions by Time magazine. David told
*10:34.600- 10:40.980* :  us more about how it works. How this works is the earbud goes inside your ear and would function
*10:40.980- 10:46.300* :  like any other smart earbuds that you'd buy off the shelf. However, they're always scanning
*10:47.060- 10:52.660* :  for that unique primer that tells the earbuds that the user wants to do something.
*10:53.460- 10:59.540* :  So just with the gentle flex of your jaw, we're using those signals to switch between modes. One
*10:59.540- 11:04.700* :  mode might be adjust the chair height. Another mode might be wheelchair drive control.
*11:05.360- 11:10.400* :  So the user would flex his or her jaw. They'd look at the display and it'd say either chair height,
*11:10.400- 11:15.620* :  chair angle, drive control, and let's just say it's in drive control. From there, just with the
*11:15.620- 11:21.720* :  very, very subtle nod down, it's almost like hitting the gas. It's the go signal for the wheelchair.
*11:21.720- 11:26.920* :  And then from there, the wheelchair will just turn wherever you're looking. If at any time you want to
*11:26.960- 11:32.780* :  stop, you just kind of pull your head back against the wheelchair seat and it just promptly brings you
*11:32.780- 11:40.140* :  to a stop. Now, you had this tested, didn't you, by the former Vancouver Mayor Sam Sullivan? Tell me
*11:40.140- 11:47.080* :  about that. Yes, what a phenomenal gentleman. And this is a gentleman that has spent the
*11:47.080- 11:52.760* :  larger part of his life in a wheelchair as a quadriplegic due to a skiing accident. When he first
*11:52.760- 11:58.880* :  heard of Nockie, he couldn't wait to try it out. And we met up with him at his home in Vancouver.
*11:58.880- 12:06.140* :  And that was the very first time he'd ever had a chance to use the wheelchair. And his reaction was,
*12:07.120- 12:12.800* :  he was almost at my throat tightens up even hearing it because sometimes I'm not used to these
*12:12.800- 12:18.180* :  reactions. As he said, I've been waiting for something like this my entire life. And there's no
*12:18.180- 12:23.560* :  words. It's hard to put into words how important it is to hear those words come out of Sam's
*12:23.560- 12:29.340* :  mouth. And just the sound of hope creates such enormous drive for me. It's hard to put into words.
*12:30.120- 12:35.180* :  David Segel. And we spoke to Sam Sullivan about his experience using Nockie earbuds.
*12:36.320- 12:43.580* :  Well, it's really meant to enable people like me to access the whole world really. It's a
*12:44.180- 12:50.760* :  super power in a way that I will be able to control many, many aspects of my environment.
*12:50.760- 12:55.720* :  You know, it's not just controlling your chair. It's it's now controlling your computer control.
*12:55.720- 13:02.320* :  Turn your lights off and on. Turn your heat up and down. Each layer that you get into has a
*13:02.320- 13:07.540* :  different set of controls for different parts of your life. So when you tested these for the first
*13:07.540- 13:13.760* :  time, what was that process like? Well, I had very little training. You know, it was just throwing
*13:13.760- 13:19.300* :  in the chair and get the earbud in and then start moving my head around. And it was amazing. I was
*13:19.300- 13:26.100* :  able to completely control my chair right away, which was surprising. I said, look Mom, no hands.
*13:26.300- 13:31.740* :  So I was just doing wheelies around my lobby, just exploring, you know, sort of like some
*13:33.460- 13:40.800* :  a newborn horse, you know, but galloping around just experiencing all of these new feelings.
*13:40.800- 13:47.120* :  I thought, let's go for a walk, you know, having these technological breakthroughs and having
*13:47.120- 13:52.720* :  the opportunity to participate in life will make it possible for so many people with disabilities
*13:52.720- 13:58.040* :  to just live their best life. So it's a great liberating moment, Ms. Naki.
*13:59.100- 14:05.260* :  And Sam, how does it feel to know that there are people out there like Dave Segal, who are
*14:05.260- 14:10.780* :  dedicating their lives and their careers to this field of making this kind of technology?
*14:11.500- 14:17.120* :  Always like it's like a miracle. Like we're just going to come from so many challenges that we have.
*14:17.120- 14:23.660* :  And this guy drops out of this guy. Wow. How lucky I am and how lucky we all are to have
*14:24.240- 14:31.440* :  people like him that are willing to really throw their significant abilities behind solving
*14:31.440- 14:38.900* :  problems for us. If, you know, it's measuring the relief of all of these bondage, you know,
*14:38.900- 14:44.900* :  that you're in when you can't move, you know, to be able to help someone throw up these kind of
*14:44.900- 14:52.420* :  shackles and do things that they never imagined they could do. That truly is a very wonderful thing.
*14:53.300- 14:57.440* :  Former Vancouver Mayor and Naki Airbods tester, Sam Sullivan.
*15:02.860- 15:07.940* :  Coming up in this podcast, celebrating 100 years of the Scottish Country Dancing Society.
*15:07.940- 15:13.480* :  So a large crowd had already started to gather. And then as typically Scottish,
*15:14.180- 15:19.420* :  the accordionist struck up and the whole street started to dance. The whole street dance,
*15:19.420- 15:20.860* :  the dashing weight sergeant.
*15:32.040- 15:36.220* :  Hello, hope you're enjoying the pod you're listening to. My name is Justin Webb. I work at the BBC.
*15:36.220- 15:42.680* :  I'm one of the hosts of America's. It's a podcast all about American news and politics and
*15:42.680- 15:48.520* :  society. And we have literally just come out of the studio. We recorded a really powerful episode.
*15:48.520- 15:53.400* :  A lot of it's about the former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who has died at the age of
*15:53.400- 15:58.860* :  a hundred. Who is he? What do you actually do? Why was he such an important figure? But also because
*15:58.860- 16:04.880* :  whether BBC, we are just giving it to you straight to no opinions, just insight, expert analysis.
*16:04.880- 16:08.740* :  So to listen, just search for America's. Wherever you get your podcast.
*16:14.380- 16:18.800* :  Welcome back. We're sticking with the theme of innovation and technology with this next story.
*16:19.320- 16:24.420* :  Electric vehicles are widely known as being environmentally friendly, but among various challenges
*16:24.420- 16:30.420* :  that the industry faces to become as affordable, efficient and eco-friendly as possible, batteries
*16:30.420- 16:36.860* :  are a key player. In Sweden, researchers have found a way to more efficiently recycle lithium and
*16:36.860- 16:44.100* :  aluminium from batteries. Their method allows the recovery of 100% of aluminium and 98% of lithium
*16:44.100- 16:50.860* :  in each battery. Leia Rocket is a PhD researcher at Charna's University of Technology in Gothenburg.
*16:51.300- 16:55.800* :  I spoke to her and her supervisor and research leader Martina Petranikovah.
*16:56.280- 17:02.980* :  We use one family of recycling metal that is called hydrometology, that is getting out from the
*17:02.980- 17:08.920* :  battery waste, all the different valuable metal into the liquid solution. And then we have a
*17:08.920- 17:14.520* :  succession of different operations that will recover one after the other or the elements. And
*17:14.520- 17:21.240* :  lithium is recovered at last in those typical flowcharts that have been developed in the last decade.
*17:21.980- 17:28.200* :  And our approach is to recover lithium at first in the flowcharts before any of the other elements.
*17:28.920- 17:33.600* :  And that would help improve the overall recovery of lithium in the total process.
*17:34.660- 17:41.400* :  And so how might this new method of recycling, how might that elevate the process?
*17:42.300- 17:46.460* :  In the traditional way, there can be some laws of lithium because when we separate different
*17:46.460- 17:52.140* :  metals from each other and we have to recover them in a very high purity, usually this can lead
*17:52.140- 17:58.020* :  to a loss of the lithium and also other metals. And the technology which is available these days
*17:58.020- 18:03.400* :  is very long. So it has a lot of steps to separate all the metals and also impurities from
*18:03.400- 18:07.520* :  each other. And this technology makes this process much shorter.
*18:08.040- 18:12.560* :  And a question for you Leia, when you were in the laboratory during this research,
*18:12.700- 18:17.060* :  what did it feel like when you realized your experiment was working?
*18:17.580- 18:23.420* :  I think I was very excited but I was also a bit more calm on the approach and I was aware that
*18:23.520- 18:29.140* :  it's only the beginning. So now we are bringing the light on lithium. But I am alone in the lab
*18:29.140- 18:36.720* :  trying step by step to develop a food process that company are 20 people to work on that for five
*18:36.720- 18:43.620* :  years. So it is like an academic work growing on the laboratory scale and we try to do good work.
*18:43.880- 18:49.160* :  And what about you Martina? How was it for you that your PhD candidate was making these discoveries?
*18:49.980- 18:55.780* :  Well, I was of course very proud. I'm still very proud of her. Would you also realize that it's a huge
*18:55.780- 19:00.420* :  sort of like discovery in what Leia discovered was that we were not getting only the lithium but
*19:00.420- 19:06.480* :  also aluminum which in my opinion it is a huge step forward because she was able to actually
*19:06.480- 19:12.700* :  separate lithium and aluminum together. So for me, it's not only the lithium is important but
*19:12.700- 19:18.220* :  also aluminum because aluminum is impurity in this step. So if we have to remove it, if we want to
*19:18.220- 19:23.340* :  have a good performance, what's been the feedback like from your colleagues and your family and
*19:23.340- 19:29.720* :  friends to this discovery? My family, no one is from a scientific background. So I think they're
*19:29.720- 19:34.100* :  yeah, they are very excited when they saw my face in the news. But no, much more than this,
*19:34.280- 19:38.260* :  they know that I am very engaged for environments. So they were happy that I
*19:38.300- 19:44.460* :  trying to find and do something meaningful. And then colleagues, I mean, lots of us we are
*19:44.900- 19:50.940* :  having projects around recycling and many of us are doing great work. So we push each other
*19:51.200- 19:57.860* :  in the daily life. Those industries we cooperate with us, they are also very proud of us of course
*19:57.860- 20:02.760* :  because we work with the car producers and also battery producers and they are very interested
*20:03.440- 20:07.060* :  in this research. And also our colleagues, I think, that they're very proud.
*20:07.520- 20:12.180* :  Leia Roquet and Martina Petranikova from Charmers University in Sweden.
*20:13.160- 20:18.820* :  A grandfather from the UK has become the European arm-wrestling champion, a sport he was inspired
*20:18.820- 20:24.560* :  to take up after watching online videos while in bed with Covid. Mark Walden, who's 54,
*20:24.560- 20:30.100* :  began arm-wrestling competitively three years ago. Now he's won a gold medal at the grand
*20:30.100- 20:36.240* :  master's category at the European Championships in Finland. He spoke to BBC Sports, Caroline Barker.
*20:37.040- 20:43.000* :  Can we talk about Delica Age? So you are how old? I'm 54 now. So 54, but you were 53
*20:43.000- 20:47.900* :  with Covid coming through it, watching the video, saying, oh, you know, what competitive arm-wrestling,
*20:47.900- 20:53.040* :  that's what I've not done. So how do you train then to become a competitive arm-wrestler?
*20:53.440- 20:57.700* :  I've been training ever for three years. I had an inkling that I might have a prowess perhaps
*20:57.700- 21:01.580* :  in the sport. So like everybody else has just said, I went along to his arm-wrestling club.
*21:01.580- 21:04.640* :  My first, you know, I'd spoken to him, said, I'm going to come along enough, but I'm just going to
*21:04.640- 21:09.020* :  smash everyone. It's going to be easy. And everyone smash me, even the lightest,
*21:09.020- 21:13.700* :  smallest guys pinned me to the pad, and I was totally demoralised in the work, oh no, okay,
*21:13.700- 21:18.120* :  either I give this up right now, or I train really, really hard and get good at it. And so,
*21:18.420- 21:21.660* :  obviously, I've made myself at promise and I train really, really hard. I train harder than
*21:21.660- 21:26.140* :  most to be fair, because I've got a lot of catching up to do. I train half an hour every morning
*21:26.140- 21:30.020* :  my home gym, and that's pure arm-wrestling training. And then I do an hour to an hour and a half
*21:30.020- 21:35.140* :  in my commercial gym, and that'll be a 50-50 step between overall strength training and arm-wrestling.
*21:35.380- 21:39.980* :  And then we train on a Thursday evening for about two and a half hours, just table-time arm-wrestling.
*21:40.220- 21:43.940* :  So, lots of training. And I say you're a bit good. You're a European gold medalist, but we'll get
*21:43.940- 21:47.640* :  to that, because hang on, you say that you do arm-wrestling, so you've got to have someone to train
*21:47.640- 21:51.960* :  against, right? Or is there like a machine you train against? So, when I'm training at home,
*21:52.160- 21:57.420* :  either table, to some arm-wrestling table, set up with a cable system, and so I can work on all the
*21:57.420- 22:02.220* :  angles that I would be with while I'm holding someone's hand, just to get strong in those positions.
*22:02.360- 22:06.540* :  And then when we go to the club, there's probably 10, 15 of us there, and we will just basically
*22:07.000- 22:11.560* :  take turns arm-wrestling each other, setting up in positions where we would perhaps be in a losing
*22:11.560- 22:16.660* :  position and need to get out of it, and then take turns of trying to pin the person, things like that.
*22:16.800- 22:19.620* :  Thank you for explaining that, because I had this image of you at home with your garage store
*22:19.620- 22:24.980* :  up and inviting all the neighbours around for a train against you. Or could be your grandchildren,
*22:24.980- 22:29.180* :  because I hear one of them has a nickname for you. I'll get called the whole. Let's just say
*22:29.180- 22:33.480* :  she, my granddaughter, calls me the Hulk, because she said, I'll be in C-Shirt, and she'd like to
*22:33.480- 22:37.860* :  assert she calls me the Hulk. My grandson likes to arm-wrestling out again, and obviously he's the
*22:37.860- 22:41.620* :  strongest seven-year-old in the world, because he pins me every single time, I don't understand
*22:41.620- 22:46.180* :  how that works. You wouldn't be letting him win, would you now Mark? Absolutely not, he wins every time.
*22:46.260- 22:50.760* :  Well, you know, he'll take your European gold medal off you. What was that like for you winning that?
*22:51.040- 22:56.200* :  That was a really, really good experience for me, because sadly, I'd lost my father just before
*22:56.200- 23:00.720* :  I went out to Finland. It was in Finland, and I kind of thought, do you know what, if I can win this,
*23:00.720- 23:06.660* :  if I can even place this will be for my dad, and I got through to the finals, and I phone everyone
*23:06.660- 23:09.680* :  up, and I said, I've got through the finals, I've got through the finals, I was actually on the B side,
*23:09.680- 23:14.640* :  which means I've got to win twice to win the competition, because the guy that I pull against
*23:14.640- 23:18.760* :  is not lost yet, and I've lost one match, so I've got to win twice. I'm like, the chance is
*23:18.760- 23:24.900* :  a low, but you know, we see how we do, and I grin and beard and try my hardest, 100%, 110%,
*23:24.900- 23:29.340* :  I pulled him enough, and I beat him the two times I needed to step on a podium, and yeah,
*23:29.340- 23:32.860* :  it was the best experience ever, and obviously that was my dad as well, I stood up,
*23:32.860- 23:35.720* :  they were the flag, and listening to the national anthem, it was absolutely super.
*23:36.400- 23:42.940* :  Mark Walden speaking to Caroline Barker. Dance and music are at the hearts of many cultures
*23:42.940- 23:48.960* :  around the world, and Scotland is no exception. Scottish dancing has been performed to traditional
*23:48.960- 23:53.960* :  tunes for centuries, bringing together people from all backgrounds and parts of the country.
*23:54.620- 24:00.020* :  The Royal Scottish Country Dance Society has just marked its centenary year and crowds gathered
*24:00.020- 24:06.380* :  in the city of Glasgow to celebrate by, of course, joining together for a jig. We spoke to William
*24:06.380- 24:12.000* :  Williamson, the chair of the society. We all wandered along to Buchanan Street,
*24:12.060- 24:17.820* :  so a large crowd had already started to gather, and then as typically Scottish,
*24:18.560- 24:23.780* :  the accordionist struck up, and the whole street started to dance. The whole street dance,
*24:23.780- 24:25.200* :  the dashing white sergeant,
*24:31.860- 24:35.820* :  and that was a mixture of our dancers and the general public, because there's one thing we do in
*24:35.820- 24:42.140* :  Scotland is we enjoy a party wherever and whenever it happens. It was wonderful. It was wonderful,
*24:42.140- 24:46.980* :  amazing. I'm so pleased. I mean, the photos and the videos that I've seen of this
*24:46.980- 24:54.600* :  are just superb. I mean, smiling faces, incredible dancing. I mean, I could never even attempt
*24:54.600- 25:00.680* :  anything so complex. Now, Harry, you could, and that's the thing, you absolutely could.
*25:00.980- 25:04.220* :  This is the thing about Scottish dancing, and that's why it survived. You know,
*25:04.740- 25:08.240* :  it can be as formal as you want, or it can be as informal. So there was at the weekend,
*25:08.340- 25:11.800* :  we had a ball and a formal ball in the Friday night, but there we were dancing in our training
*25:11.800- 25:18.120* :  shoes and jeans on the Sunday morning, and it's that in Scotland, all levels of society danced.
*25:18.620- 25:22.320* :  They danced the same dancing. So it would be done in the kitchens of the cottages. It would be
*25:22.320- 25:27.100* :  done with the aristocracy and the big hussies, as we call them. But in Scotland, there was never
*25:27.100- 25:32.740* :  that separation. So everybody danced, and wherever we go in the world, it would be expats originally
*25:32.740- 25:38.340* :  would start the dancing, wherever they landed in America, Japan, wherever. Now it's local people
*25:38.340- 25:42.760* :  who do it. And we have three huge branches in Japan. We have a wonderful group in Buenos
*25:42.760- 25:47.260* :  Harris and they're all Argentinians. And of course, we're people in Australia, New Zealand. We
*25:47.260- 25:52.920* :  even have a branch in Hawaii. But it's that Scottish bit about wanting everyone to come and join in.
*25:52.920- 25:59.140* :  It's very much a living tradition, but with that wonderful Scottish element of come on and join us.
*25:59.420- 26:05.180* :  So Harry, there will be a Scottish country dance group near you. So go and join it and have fun.
*26:05.180- 26:09.320* :  You'll have a great time. I think if anyone can convince me, I think it's you William. I think
*26:09.320- 26:16.000* :  I'm very tempted. Now, for those listeners that have never seen Scottish country dance, can you
*26:16.000- 26:21.420* :  describe it for us? All right. So it's the social dancing of Scotland. So it tends to be done in
*26:21.420- 26:26.160* :  teams, I suppose. And then you progress down the set to the foot of the set and then another
*26:26.160- 26:31.640* :  couple starts at the top. And it's done to fabulous music. And that's unique to Scotland,
*26:31.640- 26:43.060* :  that rhythm, where you put the short note before the long note. That's what gives it that.
*26:43.060- 26:48.040* :  And it's called the Scottish snack. And the music is just wonderful. And it gives it that great
*26:48.040- 26:54.760* :  spirit to get everyone in the floor and dance. And to you, William, what is the importance of Scottish
*26:54.760- 27:00.860* :  dancing? Scotland's culture is its heart. And at the heart of that is Scotland's songs,
*27:00.860- 27:08.840* :  Scotland's music and Scotland's dance. And it all comes from that great Scottish heart that
*27:09.180- 27:14.560* :  of welcoming, of friendship. Let's all get on. Let's all be friendly. Let's all join in.
*27:21.100- 27:26.420* :  William Williamson celebrating 100 years of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society.
*27:27.060- 27:33.120* :  And this music was performed by David Oswald and his band for a special episode of BBC Radio
*27:33.560- 27:37.060* :  Scotland's Take the Floor, marking this special anniversary.
