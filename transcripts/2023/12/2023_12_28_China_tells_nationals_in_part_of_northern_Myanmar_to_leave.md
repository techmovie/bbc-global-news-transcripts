*00:59.220- 01:05.980* :  Hi, I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday, the 28th of December, these are our main
*01:05.980- 01:13.040* :  stories. China has told its nationals in parts of northern Myanmar to evacuate because of escalating
*01:13.040- 01:18.420* :  risks of conflict. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged Israel to end
*01:18.420- 01:24.080* :  the unlawful killings of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Rights groups say the Indian
*01:24.080- 01:28.800* :  government is continuing to target journalists by putting spyware on their phones.
*01:31.080- 01:38.260* :  Also in this podcast, scientists say they found an easy way to identify water and signs of life
*01:38.600- 01:45.240* :  on planets in other solar systems and Ghana is entranced by a musical world record attempt.
*01:53.620- 01:57.080* :  The longest ever singer-thorn started on Christmas Eve.
*02:01.680- 02:06.340* :  In recent months, rebel groups in northern Myanmar have seized several towns and military
*02:06.340- 02:11.360* :  outposts along the border with China posing a huge challenge for the military junta.
*02:11.600- 02:16.980* :  Now, China has urged its nationals in the region to evacuate because of the escalating conflict.
*02:16.980- 02:23.200* :  A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Miao Ning, warned Chinese citizens of the
*02:23.200- 02:26.240* :  increased safety risks in the Laokai District.
*02:27.660- 02:33.240* :  The current security situation in Myanmar's Kokang Autonomous Region is grim and complicated.
*02:33.260- 02:38.640* :  We remind Chinese citizens not to travel to northern Myanmar for now and call on Chinese
*02:38.640- 02:41.240* :  citizens already there to move to a safe area.
*03:08.700- 03:13.500* :  Which China wanted shut down and we assume is the reason why China
*03:14.240- 03:17.660* :  tacitly accepted these rebel groups making all these advances.
*03:18.180- 03:22.120* :  After two months, it looks like the MNDA is on the point of taking Laokai.
*03:22.120- 03:28.040* :  There's a lot of bad blood between them and a rival group, a pro-military group that's been running
*03:28.040- 03:33.720* :  the town for the past 20 years and so it's quite likely it could get a bit messy when they take over.
*03:34.180- 03:40.120* :  I think China's view also is that anybody left in Laokai is either involved in the scams
*03:40.560- 03:41.660* :  or a victim of the scams.
*03:41.660- 03:45.240* :  Remember, most of the people involved in running these scams are in fact ethnic Chinese.
*03:45.880- 03:50.040* :  And so, in a sense, you know, what's interesting is that China has been
*03:50.500- 03:54.620* :  beating up the peace talks it's been trying to get going between these groups and the military
*03:54.620- 03:59.740* :  for the last two or three weeks, but clearly they accept that they cannot control the situation
*04:00.320- 04:05.340* :  in this part of Northeastern Myanmar and the fighting is going to go on putting anybody left at risk.
*04:05.620- 04:10.580* :  Yeah, as you say, China has been mediating between the rebel groups and the military.
*04:10.580- 04:13.440* :  Is this really a sign that those talks have failed?
*04:14.540- 04:17.300* :  Well, I think China probably always understood there were going to be difficult.
*04:17.760- 04:20.920* :  And the reality is these groups have got two goals.
*04:20.920- 04:26.980* :  These are groups with specific ethnic community ambitions to run their own areas.
*04:27.480- 04:30.180* :  They're also as an element of warlordism involved as well.
*04:30.180- 04:33.360* :  They have taken a lot of territory they want to hold it.
*04:33.640- 04:36.140* :  The Myanmar military has been badly beaten in this area,
*04:36.540- 04:38.360* :  but will want to hold on to whatever it can.
*04:38.760- 04:39.980* :  That's why the talks are difficult.
*04:40.560- 04:45.040* :  Now, officially, these groups are also saying they are now part of the broader opposition
*04:45.040- 04:47.560* :  with an ultimate goal of overthrowing the military government.
*04:47.560- 04:48.400* :  They keep saying that.
*04:48.680- 04:50.740* :  They keep saying the fighting will go on because of that.
*04:50.740- 04:55.760* :  It's not quite clear how much securing their own interests and securing their own territory
*04:55.760- 04:59.520* :  will trump the larger goal of supporting the broader opposition,
*04:59.560- 05:00.940* :  which they still say they stick to.
*05:01.380- 05:02.840* :  If they are serious about that,
*05:03.180- 05:06.380* :  well, obviously these talks can't succeed because the civil war goes on,
*05:06.380- 05:11.160* :  and these rebel groups will continue to fight because they say they're supporting this overall goal
*05:11.560- 05:12.840* :  of overthrowing the military hunter.
*05:13.660- 05:16.520* :  Southeast Asia correspondent for the BBC Jonathan Head.
*05:17.500- 05:20.940* :  It is a piece of news that will be welcomed in Ukraine.
*05:20.940- 05:25.540* :  The last tranche of US military aid for Kiev without fresh authorization
*05:25.540- 05:32.440* :  from Congress, $250 million worth of air defense, artillery, and small arms ammunition
*05:33.140- 05:34.040* :  has been made available.
*05:34.420- 05:37.940* :  But the talks in Washington about any further support remain stalled.
*05:38.260- 05:40.700* :  Our correspondent, Xinganyaka, sent this report.
*05:41.440- 05:46.400* :  The $250 million military aid package includes a defense equipment,
*05:46.400- 05:48.580* :  15 million rounds of ammunition,
*05:48.620- 05:51.820* :  as well as ammunition for rocket systems and artillery.
*05:52.580- 05:56.580* :  And with this disbursement, the US has exhausted the funding it had set aside
*05:56.580- 05:59.120* :  to help Ukraine fight the Russian invasion.
*05:59.860- 06:02.060* :  In its statement announcing this final package,
*06:02.060- 06:05.960* :  the White House urged Congress to urgently pass a new funding request,
*06:05.960- 06:08.640* :  so as to keep Ukraine's war efforts on track,
*06:08.640- 06:11.560* :  and to defend territory it recaptured from Russia.
*06:11.560- 06:14.960* :  In a statement, Secretary of State Blinken said it was imperative
*06:15.440- 06:17.980* :  that Congress act swiftly as soon as possible
*06:17.980- 06:20.860* :  to advance the US's national security interests
*06:20.860- 06:22.900* :  by helping Ukraine defend itself.
*06:22.900- 06:27.480* :  President Biden has asked Congress for another $61 billion for Ukraine,
*06:27.480- 06:30.800* :  but some Republicans are refusing to approve the assistance
*06:30.800- 06:35.140* :  without an agreement to tighten security along the US-Mexico border.
*06:35.140- 06:40.760* :  A coalition of more than 50 countries continues to provide critical support for Ukraine's forces,
*06:41.400- 06:45.520* :  but global backing for the war has begun to wane as the fighting drags on.
*06:49.340- 06:53.720* :  In Russia, reciting poetry can lead to long prison sentences,
*06:53.720- 06:57.460* :  at least for two men who were jailed for what the prosecutors called
*06:57.460- 07:00.780* :  Insighting Hatred and Threatening State Security.
*07:01.260- 07:05.220* :  Your regional editor, Danny Aberhardt, told me about what reading
*07:05.220- 07:07.420* :  poetry in Russia can lead to.
*07:08.260- 07:10.520* :  It sounds shocking in parts of the world,
*07:10.920- 07:14.460* :  but this is what happened to Atyom Kumadin, who's now 33.
*07:14.460- 07:17.800* :  He got sentenced to seven years by a court in Moscow,
*07:18.060- 07:20.340* :  and Yagor Stovba, he's 23.
*07:20.340- 07:24.060* :  He got five and a half years in jail, really long sentences.
*07:24.700- 07:28.380* :  Basically, both of them were participating at a rally at a square in Moscow
*07:28.980- 07:32.680* :  that had been used in Soviet times by dissidents to recite poetry
*07:33.160- 07:33.820* :  and things like that.
*07:33.820- 07:39.380* :  They were anti-war activists, and Atyom Kumadin recited a poem called Kill me, militiaman.
*07:39.820- 07:41.580* :  Now, this was a very sensitive time.
*07:41.580- 07:46.960* :  September last year, Russia and the Kremlin announced a partial mobilization of troops,
*07:47.600- 07:51.600* :  so the Kremlin was particularly keen to crack down on dissent at that time.
*07:52.080- 07:54.680* :  And soon after the incident, he was arrested.
*07:55.160- 07:56.060* :  Kumadin was arrested.
*07:56.060- 08:01.400* :  He said he was raped with an object in there, and his fiance,
*08:01.940- 08:05.100* :  who was there at the time of the raid, told our Russian editor, Steve Rosenberg,
*08:05.520- 08:06.000* :  what happened?
*08:08.240- 08:11.000* :  They dragged me across the floor by my hair.
*08:11.640- 08:14.140* :  They started super-gluing stickers to my face.
*08:14.860- 08:17.740* :  Then I heard the beating from the room where Atyom was.
*08:18.300- 08:21.660* :  They grabbed me by the hair and showed me a photo of him,
*08:22.080- 08:24.780* :  naked, and beaten up, covered in blood.
*08:25.720- 08:31.200* :  There were reports after this particular court case that relatives of the two men
*08:31.200- 08:36.320* :  cried shame at the verdict, and Mr. Kumadin's father called it a total outrage.
*08:36.780- 08:37.780* :  Why the harsh reaction?
*08:38.360- 08:43.120* :  Well, basically, the Kremlin has been trying ever since the start of its full-scale invasion of
*08:43.120- 08:45.800* :  Ukraine to control the public sphere.
*08:46.280- 08:49.840* :  It controls the narrative through the state media, but that in itself is not enough.
*08:49.840- 08:55.660* :  So it passed a legislation that criminalizes things like calling it a war.
*08:55.660- 08:58.600* :  It's officially known as a special military operation,
*08:59.020- 09:01.700* :  and spreading false information, it says,
*09:01.700- 09:05.940* :  or damaging national security and discrediting Russian armed forces.
*09:05.940- 09:07.840* :  So it's very harsh legislation.
*09:07.980- 09:12.720* :  The UN has criticised it's called a new low in freedom of expression,
*09:12.740- 09:18.000* :  saying it's trying to shrink independent media and also the space for civic society.
*09:18.540- 09:24.440* :  Danny Aberhardt, journalist in India may be monitored much more closely by the government
*09:24.440- 09:29.020* :  than is legally allowed, according to the Human Rights Group Amnesty International.
*09:29.020- 09:34.960* :  It says officials have secretly installed invasive Pegasus spyware on some journalist's phones,
*09:35.680- 09:38.480* :  which allows every communication they make to be monitored.
*09:39.020- 09:44.300* :  I asked our South Asia Regional Editor and Barassan Etirajan in Delhi to tell us more about
*09:44.300- 09:46.520* :  the spyware and how the government uses it.
*09:47.140- 09:52.360* :  An easterly firm makes this Pegasus spyware and this company categorically states that it
*09:52.360- 09:59.160* :  is sold only to law enforcement agencies around the world, especially to monitor terrorism,
*09:59.220- 10:02.920* :  to tackle money laundering and other major crimes.
*10:03.460- 10:09.880* :  Now how it works is that it basically takes control of your phone, even though the Android phones
*10:09.880- 10:16.240* :  could be easily exploited. It was a bit difficult on iPhone but now with the Pegasus for the last
*10:16.240- 10:21.880* :  few years. Several journalists have been complaining about how their phones were acting bizarre
*10:21.880- 10:27.080* :  even later on. An analysis found out that there were traces of this Pegasus software.
*10:27.080- 10:32.100* :  So basically it takes control of your messages and you were photographs, you were contacts
*10:32.100- 10:38.380* :  and it can also trigger the video camera and monitor all kinds of communication. Imagine if
*10:38.380- 10:43.420* :  you are a journalist, investigative journalist, working on a story against the government and you
*10:43.420- 10:48.740* :  are trying to talk to one of the government sources or a whistleblower or any other activist
*10:48.740- 10:54.260* :  on the ground. So that can be known to security agencies. Basically this not only controls your
*10:54.260- 10:59.400* :  phone, it can even send messages and that is a big concern for journalists in India following
*10:59.400- 11:05.460* :  this report by Amnesty International along with Washington Post. And Amnesty has named some of the
*11:05.460- 11:10.260* :  journalists, it says have been targeted in this way. The naming two journalists, one is Siddharth
*11:10.260- 11:15.220* :  Varadharajan, editor of the buyer and then another investigative journalist, Anand Magnale.
*11:15.600- 11:20.600* :  So both have been critical of the government and they were doing reports finding out whether
*11:20.600- 11:27.480* :  the government misused its policies or some of its actions to favor some big businessmen and now
*11:27.480- 11:32.580* :  the report clearly states that they found, according to the security experts of Amnesty International,
*11:32.580- 11:37.880* :  there were traces of this Pegasus spyware. Even though this issue has been going on for the last
*11:37.880- 11:44.460* :  few years, in October, once again Apple issued an alert to many people in India including opposition
*11:44.460- 11:50.580* :  party activists saying that it could have been targeted by state sponsored actors. So that was a
*11:50.580- 11:56.020* :  big worry for journalists and this report once again very categorically says that these two
*11:56.020- 12:00.400* :  journalists were targeted because they were some of the critics of the government.
*12:00.920- 12:05.640* :  It must make it almost impossible to do the important work that journalists do when you're
*12:05.640- 12:10.400* :  being monitored in this way. It will make it very impossible, not only that, not many people can
*12:10.400- 12:16.560* :  afford to have an iPhone which updates its security procedures, it's very expensive. And the
*12:16.560- 12:21.240* :  second thing is what else can you do to protect your sources, to protect your conversations
*12:21.960- 12:27.040* :  because everything now operates whether it is through WhatsApp chat or any other software,
*12:27.040- 12:32.280* :  that can be compromised, it becomes complicated. But the government denies using any unauthorized
*12:32.280- 12:37.120* :  surveillance of these gadgets, but at the same time it refused to cooperate with the Supreme
*12:37.120- 12:42.920* :  Court appointed panel to look into the allegations of the spyware being installed in journalist phones.
*12:43.360- 12:50.340* :  And by our son, Etirajan in Delhi. The BBC has been granted exclusive access to a world first,
*12:50.340- 12:55.940* :  the tallest wind turbine made out of wood, which has already started supplying electricity
*12:55.940- 13:01.320* :  to the grid in Sweden, where it's based. Almost all turbine towers are made of steel, which burns
*13:01.320- 13:06.420* :  fossil fuels in the production process. So this new invention is thought to be a lot more
*13:06.420- 13:11.020* :  environmentally friendly. Our climate correspondent, Jonah Fisher, sent this report.
*13:11.920- 13:19.200* :  Following in the footsteps of Abba, Meatballs and Flatpack furniture from Sweden comes another
*13:19.900- 13:19.920* :  innovation.
*13:25.580- 13:30.680* :  Currently almost all of the world's turbine towers are made of steel, which is usually
*13:30.680- 13:36.340* :  manufactured by burning fossil fuels. So these are the transversal joints. So this is where the big
*13:36.620- 13:41.500* :  piece is joined together. Exactly. I'm in western Sweden at the invitation of Modvion,
*13:41.500- 13:47.380* :  the starter behind the wooden tower. As we clamber inside chief executive Otto Lundman,
*13:47.700- 13:52.120* :  tells me it's not just made of wood, but the pieces are joined together.
*13:55.380- 14:02.400* :  These blades are like almost all wind turbines made out of fiberglass. The generator that I'm
*14:02.680- 14:09.620* :  standing on is primarily made of steel. But the company who's built the wooden tower say that
*14:09.940- 14:16.660* :  by making the tower out of wood, it's storing carbon dioxide. It's carbon negative.
*14:17.320- 14:22.940* :  But this isn't just about being greener. To reach stronger and more consistent winds,
*14:23.360- 14:30.260* :  turbines need to get even taller. And that means bigger and wider turbine towers.
*14:30.900- 14:37.200* :  Getting those massive pieces of steel on site by road is already a major headache.
*14:37.480- 14:42.500* :  At a factory in Gothenburg, David Olivegrin, Modvion's concept engineer,
*14:43.040- 14:47.640* :  shows me how more than 100 thin sheets of wood are glued together.
*14:48.460- 14:53.540* :  These are veneer sheets and it's from spruce. Christmas tree. As spruce is a very common
*14:53.540- 14:59.100* :  and a very good material. The smaller pieces can then be more easily transported.
*14:59.100- 15:06.220* :  Making a round steel tube is quite easy, but making steel modular towers. That's a challenge,
*15:06.220- 15:12.120* :  really, because you have lots of bolts. We do not bolt our towers. We glue them together.
*15:12.660- 15:18.180* :  So is using wood a serious idea? Well, the project is being backed by Vestas,
*15:18.180- 15:25.600* :  the world's largest installer of wind power by capacity. Jan Hagen is its chief technology officer
*15:26.060- 15:31.060* :  for northern and central Europe. Current best knowledge, what we see is that this technology
*15:31.060- 15:35.540* :  is particularly well suited for wind project with high hub heights, where we're harvesting
*15:35.540- 15:41.020* :  stronger winds up there in the high hub heights. The market potential for that segment is
*15:41.020- 15:46.740* :  tremendous in Europe, but also beyond. Modvion's ambitions are as high as its turbines.
*15:46.780- 15:53.980* :  It's hoping that in 10 years' time, 10% of all new turbines will be made out of wood.
*15:54.700- 15:55.940* :  Genofisher in Sweden.
*15:58.500- 16:05.120* :  Still to come on this podcast. It helps me get into this calm state of flow,
*16:05.820- 16:11.660* :  right? So if you could do five hours worth of work in one hour, that's huge.
*16:12.520- 16:14.220* :  So how productive are you feeling?
*16:20.280- 16:25.460* :  The Hamas Run Health Ministry in Gaza has reported the deaths of more than 200 Palestinians
*16:25.460- 16:31.640* :  across the strip in the last 24 hours. Medics said there were casualties in the southern city of
*16:31.640- 16:37.920* :  Harnunis, as well as Makassi in the central area and Bait Lahia close to the northern border.
*16:38.320- 16:39.940* :  Yoland Nell is in Jerusalem.
*16:40.560- 16:44.640* :  Israeli warplanes have struck across the length of Gaza according to local reports.
*16:45.300- 16:49.660* :  Medics in the southern city of Harnunis say that eight people were killed when a house where
*16:49.660- 16:55.100* :  displaced families were living was hit. Israeli tanks are also continuing to push into the center
*16:55.100- 16:59.920* :  of the Palestinian territory, where tens of thousands of garsens have been fleeing from the fighting.
*17:00.500- 17:05.380* :  Today, the Israeli military says it intercepted a drone flown into Israeli airspace from Lebanon.
*17:05.900- 17:10.060* :  Earlier in Israeli Minister said time was running out for the world and the Lebanese government
*17:10.060- 17:14.760* :  to act to stop an escalation in attacks by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah.
*17:15.200- 17:19.900* :  And there's been a new call from the UN Human Rights Chief urging Israel to stop what he called
*17:19.900- 17:25.720* :  unlawful killings in the West Bank. The UN says it's verified the deaths of 300 Palestinians
*17:25.720- 17:29.640* :  by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since early October.
*17:30.020- 17:31.560* :  Yoland Nell in Jerusalem.
*17:32.920- 17:36.440* :  Case you think we haven't been laboring hard enough over this part,
*17:36.440- 17:40.660* :  we're going to take a look now at efforts to make workers more productive.
*17:41.260- 17:45.100* :  One of the consequences of the COVID pandemic was more people working from home,
*17:45.100- 17:48.080* :  raising questions about just how productive they were.
*17:48.360- 17:52.880* :  Well, in the US, there are signs that some workers are resorting to performance
*17:52.880- 17:55.240* :  enhancing drugs to improve their output.
*17:55.740- 17:59.620* :  And North America Business Report at Michelle Flery has been looking at the story.
*18:04.060- 18:10.500* :  In the 60s psychedelic drugs such as LSD or magic mushrooms were associated with long mind-bending
*18:10.500- 18:16.340* :  trips, hallucinations and hippies. Exploration, transformation.
*18:16.940- 18:21.300* :  Today in America, some are taking such scheduled one drugs in tiny doses
*18:21.920- 18:25.600* :  in attempt to improve focus, productivity and creativity.
*18:26.720- 18:28.560* :  This is called microdosing.
*18:28.980- 18:34.340* :  Essentially, I feel like when I take it, I'm a little bit more open to creative and new ideas,
*18:35.040- 18:38.020* :  expansive thinking. Donald, whose name I've changed,
*18:38.020- 18:41.780* :  microdoses on a regular basis. He says it helps him work.
*18:42.320- 18:47.660* :  It helps me get into this calm state of flow, right?
*18:47.660- 18:53.340* :  So if you could do five hours worth of work in one hour, that's huge.
*18:53.340- 18:58.700* :  And not only are you doing that work, but you're more curious, you're more engaged.
*18:59.560- 19:04.940* :  Like microdosing is essentially a tenth of a recreational dose.
*19:05.920- 19:09.800* :  So you're not going to be hallucinating or having a psychedelic experience.
*19:10.740- 19:14.160* :  So there's a number of different ways that people could regiment it.
*19:14.360- 19:14.880* :  What do you do?
*19:15.500- 19:20.140* :  So yeah, I would sometimes take it a few days in a row and then kind of not do it a few days in a row,
*19:20.620- 19:23.120* :  but I'm usually not so strict about it.
*19:23.960- 19:28.200* :  A hallucinogenic drug use has increased among those age 26 and older,
*19:28.600- 19:32.880* :  with over 5.5 million people using psychedelics in 2019.
*19:34.820- 19:36.100* :  Hey Shane. Hey, how's it going?
*19:36.300- 19:39.380* :  As attitudes change and more people, microdosing the workplace,
*19:39.940- 19:42.140* :  I caught up with one employer embracing it.
*19:42.240- 19:45.220* :  You're taking a stance that was polarizing at times.
*19:45.780- 19:50.020* :  Shane Heath is the founder and CEO of Coffee Alternative Mudwater.
*19:50.340- 19:54.360* :  If somebody chooses microdosing as something that's helpful for them, they're free to do that.
*19:54.900- 19:58.200* :  We don't have a policy that encourages or supports the use of psychedelics,
*19:58.240- 20:01.200* :  but we don't have a policy that polices it either, right?
*20:01.820- 20:04.900* :  Not only does he support employees who want to microdose at work,
*20:05.360- 20:09.600* :  mud water denates a portion of its profits to psychedelic research and education.
*20:09.920- 20:13.960* :  It was just a personal choice to be an advocate.
*20:15.180- 20:20.520* :  America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse.
*20:21.200- 20:23.040* :  It's more than 50 years since then,
*20:23.040- 20:26.000* :  President Richard Nixon declared a war on drugs.
*20:26.240- 20:27.980* :  A new, all-out offensive.
*20:28.600- 20:31.480* :  A policy that hampered research into psychedelics.
*20:32.060- 20:34.120* :  New studies are being carried out,
*20:34.120- 20:38.420* :  but there isn't enough evidence yet to say if microdosing is beneficial
*20:39.040- 20:39.820* :  or even safe.
*20:40.540- 20:43.360* :  And the drugs being used are illegal at the federal level.
*20:43.420- 20:47.300* :  Despite the law, that hasn't stopped business leaders from indulging.
*20:47.900- 20:51.300* :  Microdosing in the workplace, it sounds like you think it has a role to play.
*20:51.760- 20:52.320* :  100 percent.
*20:52.540- 20:54.920* :  Dele Penciva coaches startup founders.
*20:54.920- 21:02.400* :  Most clients, I would say, in this day and age, are not concerned around the legal pieces,
*21:02.400- 21:04.180* :  although they'd de-respect the laws.
*21:05.320- 21:07.840* :  That's a sea change from, say, five plus years ago.
*21:08.080- 21:10.560* :  I think there's a lot of advancement right now around the research,
*21:10.640- 21:13.820* :  and then we're starting to see the regulation change at different levels
*21:13.820- 21:15.580* :  local state and national over time.
*21:18.480- 21:19.260* :  There are risks.
*21:19.660- 21:23.600* :  The unsupervised use of recreational drugs could be psychologically damaging
*21:24.180- 21:26.160* :  to those with certain mental conditions.
*21:27.040- 21:29.020* :  But with renewed interest in psychedelics,
*21:29.400- 21:32.540* :  advocates hope it will help gain mainstream acceptance.
*21:35.580- 21:36.560* :  Michelle Flurry.
*21:37.600- 21:43.540* :  Scientists say they found an easy way to identify water and signs of life on planets
*21:44.060- 21:45.180* :  in other solar systems.
*21:45.180- 21:49.200* :  It's based on measuring how much carbon dioxide there is in its atmosphere,
*21:49.600- 21:51.080* :  Ristopeco, as the details.
*21:51.860- 21:55.080* :  Our telescopes aren't powerful enough to see exoplanets in detail,
*21:55.080- 22:00.020* :  but we can study the light they emit, and it carries clear signs of the gases in their
*22:00.020- 22:00.680* :  atmospheres.
*22:01.180- 22:04.320* :  We know from Earth that oceans absorb some of the CO2,
*22:04.320- 22:07.920* :  so measuring a reduced amount of the gas on an exoplanet
*22:08.140- 22:10.420* :  would strongly imply it has surface water,
*22:11.040- 22:12.560* :  something that's seen as important for life.
*22:13.340- 22:17.160* :  Living organisms also absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen.
*22:17.160- 22:20.620* :  This two can be measured when it's transformed into ozone.
*22:21.220- 22:25.380* :  Together, these two low CO2 levels and the presence of ozone
*22:25.380- 22:28.500* :  would be relatively strong indications of life.
*22:28.840- 22:30.060* :  Ristopeco.
*22:30.860- 22:34.780* :  Now, is this the sound of a world record breaker?
*22:42.740- 22:48.640* :  The voice of Afula Asantiwa, a Ghanaian media personality and entrepreneur who,
*22:48.640- 22:54.500* :  as we record this pod, is attempting the Guinness World Record for the longest
*22:55.000- 22:58.800* :  Singathon. She started singing on Sunday the 24th,
*22:59.400- 23:03.040* :  and is hoping to beat the record of 105 hours.
*23:03.040- 23:08.440* :  I spoke to reporter Daniel Dadzi, who is in the crowd in a Kragana.
*23:08.940- 23:14.900* :  What happened by behind me is that Afula Asantiwa is attempting to break the
*23:14.900- 23:18.760* :  current Guinness World Record for the longest Singapore.
*23:19.520- 23:23.220* :  The current record is being held by Indian Sunil Wagari,
*23:23.720- 23:29.260* :  and he did that in 2012, and he sang for 105 hours.
*23:29.260- 23:36.500* :  Now, officially, that 105-hour mark was crossed at 9am GMT today.
*23:36.880- 23:40.920* :  As I speak to you now, that was an hour and 37 minutes ago,
*23:41.500- 23:45.680* :  because if what began singing on the 24th of December,
*23:46.340- 23:51.420* :  and if you've been singing for basically about four days and so far,
*23:51.420- 23:55.520* :  10 hours, 37 minutes, it's a whirling feat.
*23:55.520- 23:59.820* :  I don't know if any other person would have the capacity to do that.
*24:00.180- 24:02.800* :  And Ghana is absolutely fascinated, isn't it?
*24:04.180- 24:07.060* :  The whole nation is united behind her,
*24:07.340- 24:11.040* :  and a cluster of media personalities, celebrities,
*24:11.960- 24:14.700* :  the vice-president of the country came here,
*24:15.200- 24:17.240* :  and a number of other notable politicians.
*24:17.240- 24:20.040* :  Is it really that difficult, though?
*24:20.040- 24:24.260* :  I mean, she's just sitting on the stage, she's singing, she's taking quite a lot of breaks.
*24:24.460- 24:28.400* :  I mean, what can we all do if we had the chance?
*24:28.440- 24:31.840* :  I think it sounds easier than it actually is, Alex.
*24:31.840- 24:37.660* :  I mean, imagine doing anything at all for eight hours straight is a bit of a chore.
*24:38.040- 24:41.040* :  Now, think about the fact that you're straining your vocal cords.
*24:41.580- 24:43.920* :  You're not sleeping, as you should.
*24:44.460- 24:48.280* :  So your energy is drained, and you've been doing this nonstop.
*24:48.280- 24:52.580* :  The thing is, she's allowed to take a 20-minute break every four hours,
*24:53.280- 24:56.680* :  or alternatively, she can take a five-minute break every hour.
*24:57.120- 24:59.620* :  And those are the only breaks she's allowed to take.
*24:59.620- 25:02.480* :  However, if she extends any of those breaks,
*25:02.860- 25:04.700* :  she's going to have to make up for the time.
*25:05.380- 25:10.260* :  Also, if she does need to take an emergency medical or technical break,
*25:10.260- 25:13.580* :  she's allowed to do that, and it doesn't count against her.
*25:13.920- 25:18.500* :  Now, Alex, imagine standing and, well, she's been, she was sitting at the point,
*25:18.900- 25:20.460* :  she was lying on the ground at the point.
*25:20.840- 25:23.860* :  She's only allowed 30 seconds between every song,
*25:24.420- 25:27.300* :  and she has to sing every song for at least two minutes.
*25:27.940- 25:29.940* :  The words have to be intelligible,
*25:30.480- 25:33.980* :  and she can't just go into a jamming or freestyle session.
*25:34.380- 25:39.880* :  They have to be songs that are known, because she would submit that playlist to GWR.
*25:40.340- 25:42.300* :  It's twice the Johnson task.
*25:53.540- 25:55.200* :  Daniel, don't see you with that report.
*25:58.560- 26:01.120* :  And that's all from us for now,
*26:01.120- 26:04.600* :  but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*26:04.960- 26:08.840* :  If you want to comment on this podcast, all the topics covered in it,

*26:26.160- 26:28.340* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
