*01:49.640- 01:55.300* :  I'm Alex Richardson and in the early hours of Sunday, the 24th of December, these are our main
*01:55.300- 02:01.040* :  stories. The UN Special Envoy to Yemen says the warring parties have agreed to work towards a
*02:01.040- 02:07.160* :  nationwide ceasefire. Israel says it's interrogating hundreds of suspected Hamas and Islamic
*02:07.160- 02:12.900* :  jihad operatives who've been captured in Gaza. An anti-war candidate who hoped to challenge
*02:12.900- 02:18.060* :  Vladimir Putin in Russia's presidential election next year has been denied registration.
*02:20.580- 02:25.280* :  Also in this podcast, the various populations had acquired genetic differences
*02:25.280- 02:32.400* :  through being separated by thick ice. Scientists in Australia have raised new fears about the collapse
*02:32.400- 02:38.700* :  of Antarctica's huge western ice sheet, a surprising animal study has helped them to draw such
*02:43.320- 02:47.900* :  conclusions. Hundreds of thousands of people have died in nine years of fighting between different
*02:47.900- 02:53.700* :  factions in Yemen in a civil war which has drawn in neighboring states and further sharpened tensions
*02:53.700- 02:58.720* :  between them. The war has also spilled over into attacks on shipping in the Red Sea through
*02:58.720- 03:04.320* :  which much of the world's oil travels. We'll be hearing from India in a moment about a similar
*03:04.320- 03:10.120* :  attack off its shores, but the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, on Saturday,
*03:10.120- 03:14.380* :  announced that both sides, the hoof is in the north, and the Saudi-backed government,
*03:14.380- 03:19.840* :  have committed two steps towards a ceasefire. The language is cautious and diplomatic,
*03:19.840- 03:26.900* :  but it could open the way to transform life for Yemenis, 80% of whom depend on humanitarian aid.
*03:27.320- 03:31.180* :  I've been speaking to the journalist and Yemen expert Iona Craig.
*03:33.920- 03:40.140* :  It had already been a ceasefire agreed in March 2022, but they hadn't renewed it when it expired
*03:40.140- 03:46.440* :  in October of last year, so it would renew that, but there's also other details that the UN has
*03:46.440- 03:51.840* :  revealed as part of this apparent agreement, which have been sticking points along the road since
*03:51.840- 03:58.020* :  then, and that's about paying public sector salaries, the resumption of oil exports by the
*03:58.300- 04:01.960* :  internationally recognised government, which the Houthis have prevented before by carrying out
*04:01.960- 04:07.000* :  drone strikes on oil tankers, opening up the road, and that includes around the city of tyres,
*04:07.000- 04:13.220* :  which has been besieged by the Houthis, unbelievably since 2015, and easing other restrictions
*04:13.340- 04:18.200* :  on Sonar Airport, the Houthis Control and the Port of a Data, which the Houthis also control.
*04:18.980- 04:23.140* :  So, yes, I mean, it's progressed, but some of this is a little bit of a rehash of what was
*04:23.140- 04:28.780* :  agreed in 2022, but was never implemented. Of course, the Iran-backed Houthis have been
*04:28.780- 04:34.900* :  attacking, as you say, shipping in the Red Sea off Yemen's coast, and that has prompted the United
*04:34.900- 04:40.660* :  States and others to make an international task force to keep that shipping safe. How does that
*04:40.960- 04:48.020* :  play into this? Well, Saudi Arabia has actually been behind the scenes, quietly asking the US not
*04:48.020- 04:53.200* :  to attack the Houthis directly, so not to carry out offensive measures in response to these attacks
*04:53.200- 04:59.080* :  by the Houthis in the Red Sea, because they had a deal lined up with the Houthis, really outside
*04:59.080- 05:05.500* :  of the UN mechanism, the UN Special Envoy's office, that was due to be signed back in October.
*05:05.960- 05:11.040* :  And then of course, Gaza happened? Yes, the Hamas attacked happened, and the Saudis are extremely
*05:11.040- 05:16.040* :  keen to extract themselves from this conflict, so I suppose, really, by having this moment now,
*05:16.040- 05:21.980* :  the UN Special Envoy said that this deal is now happening, is that if there are offensive
*05:21.980- 05:27.860* :  measures by the US or others with Navy's now taking part in the protection of vessels in the
*05:27.860- 05:31.900* :  Red Sea, if they do decide to attack the Houthis directly, then this could put all of this in
*05:31.900- 05:37.440* :  jeopardy. You're one of the few Western journalists who've reported regularly from Yemen, you know
*05:37.440- 05:41.460* :  the country well, do you think this is going to happen? Do I think this deal is going to go ahead?
*05:41.460- 05:47.580* :  I mean, honestly, I think with the Houthis, you have to take it with a huge amount of
*05:47.580- 05:52.700* :  skepticism. As I said before, they haven't kept the deals in the past. The Houthis' word is not
*05:52.740- 05:56.780* :  always their bond and definitely hasn't been, and as I say, some of these measures put forward by
*05:56.780- 06:01.940* :  the UN Special Envoy today in this deal have already been put forward before, and the Houthis
*06:01.940- 06:08.520* :  haven't stuck to them. Journalist and Yemen expert Iona Craig. I mentioned that drone attack
*06:08.520- 06:14.580* :  off the coast of India a moment ago. The target was described as an Israel-affiliated ship sailing
*06:14.580- 06:20.860* :  under a Liberian flag. It had been on its way from Saudi Arabia to India. I got more details
*06:20.860- 06:27.940* :  from Anbarasan at a Russian in Delhi. This attack said to happen about 200 unautical
*06:27.940- 06:35.560* :  miles off the coast of Gujarat State in Western India. Now, the attack sparked a fire on board
*06:35.560- 06:41.280* :  the ship, which was put out, but according to the officials, none of the roughly 20 crew members
*06:41.280- 06:47.740* :  were harmed. What is surprising is this incident happened not far from the Indian coast. That means
*06:48.380- 06:55.360* :  it's from Yemen. It is about 2,000 kilometers approximately away from Yemen. That's where in the
*06:55.360- 07:01.520* :  Red Sea, as you mentioned, many of the attacks on ships were being carried out by Houthi rebels,
*07:02.340- 07:07.800* :  and according to the US, more than 10 vessels have been attacked in such a fashion by these
*07:07.800- 07:14.960* :  rebels because of the ongoing war in Gaza. So, there are suspicions that it could be someone
*07:14.960- 07:21.960* :  from Iran or from the region, but there has been no claim or no known as admitted responsibility
*07:21.960- 07:28.580* :  for the attack. It also shows what kind of dangers these commercial ships face. India must be
*07:28.580- 07:34.480* :  worried about this. It must be of concern to India because India is among the largest buyer of
*07:35.260- 07:40.660* :  petrochemical products. So, they really depend on these supplies. If these attacks increase,
*07:41.520- 07:46.300* :  that could create a trouble for India. But what is interesting is, as I was mentioning,
*07:46.300- 07:52.260* :  this was happening far away from the Red Sea, more than 2,000 kilometers away from the Red Sea.
*07:52.720- 07:58.440* :  So, it is also warning sign for many of these merchant navy ships. You may know, in the merchant
*07:58.440- 08:04.180* :  vessels, there are thousands of Indians and Filipinos. They're working mainly in these industry.
*08:04.800- 08:10.800* :  So, that is another concern for the government here because if the Indian citizens are injured or
*08:10.800- 08:16.260* :  anything happens to them, that will be a big warning sign for the Indian government as well.
*08:16.500- 08:22.820* :  And Barassan et Aarajan in Delhi. Israel says its questioning hundreds of suspected Hamas
*08:22.820- 08:28.440* :  and Islamic Jihad operatives after transferring them from Gaza to Israel. The military said some
*08:28.440- 08:33.580* :  of the men had been hiding among the civilian population. Israel's bombardment of Gaza is
*08:33.580- 08:39.000* :  continuing relentlessly. In Khan Unis, around 50 people are reported to have been killed over
*08:39.000- 08:44.680* :  the past 24 hours. Residents in Jabali air refugee camp in the north of the territory have
*08:44.680- 08:50.620* :  reported persistent aerial bombardment and shelling throughout Saturday. The deputy director of the
*08:50.620- 08:55.980* :  UN World Food Program, Karl Skow, says half of the people of Gaza are starving.
*08:56.460- 09:01.160* :  Something drastic needs to change. If we continue with the current situation, you know, famine will
*09:01.160- 09:05.580* :  happen in the next few weeks. Four out of five of the angriest people in the world right now
*09:05.980- 09:11.280* :  are in Gaza. And that given the situations we already have in the Sahel, in the DRC,
*09:11.780- 09:17.180* :  in the one of Africa, in Afghanistan. So, I think that tells you that this is a very dramatic
*09:17.180- 09:23.040* :  and serious situation. Mark Reggev, who is a senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister,
*09:23.040- 09:28.940* :  acknowledged what he called terrible suffering in Gaza. But told the BBC, this was because the
*09:28.940- 09:34.760* :  territories Hamas leadership didn't give a hoot for the people there. He said Hamas had no
*09:34.760- 09:39.440* :  intention of ending its fight against Israel. People who call for an immediate ceasefire,
*09:39.440- 09:44.640* :  what are they ultimately saying? They're saying Israel has to make a cease its operation against
*09:44.640- 09:50.900* :  Hamas and Hamas stays in power in Gaza. That's the bottom line. If Hamas stays in power, that just
*09:50.900- 09:55.480* :  condemns us all to more bloodshed in the future because Hamas openly says it does not believe in
*09:55.480- 10:01.200* :  peace with Israeli beliefs in the Hamas's words, permanent war. Our correspondent, Shima Khalil,
*10:01.200- 10:06.920* :  followed Saturday's developments in Gaza. I asked her first about the arrests made by the Israeli
*10:06.920- 10:12.200* :  forces. The Israeli statement said that some of those suspects have been hiding among the civilian
*10:12.200- 10:18.620* :  population and some of them had surrendered voluntarily. And we've heard repeatedly from the
*10:18.620- 10:24.680* :  Israeli army about the fact that Hamas militants have been hiding among civilian population that's
*10:24.680- 10:29.980* :  been their consistent claim. And this is what we've heard about some of the people have been
*10:29.980- 10:35.220* :  arrested. All in all, Israel says that 700 Palestinian militants have been arrested since the
*10:35.220- 10:40.440* :  beginning of the war, 200 of them in this past week. We heard that clip a few moments ago from
*10:40.440- 10:47.280* :  the deputy director of the World Food Program, saying half of the people in Gaza are starving.
*10:47.280- 10:51.680* :  The situation on the ground is just getting worse, isn't it? It is getting worse. And I think the
*10:51.680- 10:56.880* :  strong wording keeps coming from the United Nations. You know, the word famine has been used
*10:56.880- 11:02.840* :  quite a lot this week. The fact that many World Food Program officials have said Gaza is looking
*11:02.840- 11:09.800* :  at a serious prospect of famine that no one is safe from starvation in Gaza. And it just shows you
*11:09.800- 11:17.260* :  the acute and urgent need of aid not just to be delivered, but also to be distributed properly in
*11:17.260- 11:21.740* :  Gaza. Because remember, with the geography, the difficult geography of Gaza, even though it's such
*11:21.740- 11:27.420* :  a small place, is that it normally is very densely populated. A lot of this population has now,
*11:27.420- 11:32.660* :  has been displaced down south. So with the little aid that's coming in, either from Ruffahal
*11:32.660- 11:38.400* :  Khrimshalom in the south, it's challenging at the best of times to distribute it among the population
*11:38.400- 11:45.080* :  there. Spare a thought for those still hold up in the north. That aid has got a long and treacherous
*11:45.340- 11:48.860* :  journey to get to those who needed the most. And that's just not happening because of the
*11:48.860- 11:55.960* :  relentless bombardment. And Shama, you're in Bethlehem in the West Bank, normally quite a special
*11:55.960- 12:01.180* :  place to be at this time of the year. But I imagine rather different at the moment. Very, very different.
*12:01.180- 12:06.100* :  Someone told me that Bethlehem is a shadow of itself. And you could feel the heaviness really.
*12:06.100- 12:12.580* :  You could feel that the war in Gaza is weighing heavily on this holy place. Normally, you would
*12:12.580- 12:17.360* :  attract hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pilgrims of tourists, said this time of year,
*12:17.860- 12:23.860* :  you know, manger square is just, it's empty. And I think the heaviness also comes from the absence,
*12:24.020- 12:28.960* :  the absence of this huge Christmas tree, the absence of Christmas carols, the absence of joy.
*12:28.960- 12:33.320* :  And of course, the absence of peace because of what's happening in Gaza. And many have said that
*12:33.820- 12:39.240* :  it feels very, very strange to have it like this, but it feels difficult to celebrate with the deaths
*12:39.260- 12:45.440* :  and the killing that is happening in Gaza. Shama Khalil, the situation in Gaza is being watched
*12:45.440- 12:50.140* :  closely across the region, most of all by other Palestinians. The vast majority of
*12:50.140- 12:56.780* :  cousins are refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War or their descendants. Millions of Palestinians
*12:56.780- 13:02.300* :  are scattered across the Middle East and beyond. About half a million are registered in Lebanon.
*13:02.300- 13:09.740* :  Many of them displaced in the Wars of 48 and 1967. Decades later, they're still struggling
*13:09.740- 13:15.680* :  to settle. And for many, the war in Gaza is both a traumatic flashback and a worrying development
*13:15.680- 13:21.900* :  for the future. The BBC's Linus in Jab has been to the Chatila refugee camp south of Beirut.
*13:26.600- 13:29.960* :  Our house was on a hill. It was very beautiful, built of stones.
*13:30.660- 13:37.500* :  Daoud Nasr is originally from Nazareth. He arrived in Lebanon with his family in 1948 when he was
*13:37.500- 13:44.860* :  six. We walked from Palestine to Bint Jabale. Daoud's family members now live in Lebanon,
*13:44.860- 13:51.220* :  Europe and Gaza, where one of his sons is. His son's house was destroyed at the start of the war.
*13:51.880- 13:57.080* :  And he's now displaced in southern Gaza. He goes through his phone to show me photos of his
*13:57.080- 14:03.200* :  grandchildren there. This latest war has reopened all the warnings and has pushed him to the extreme.
*14:03.200- 14:10.220* :  If you look at Hiroshima, it is not as bad as what they did in Gaza. They want to exterminate
*14:10.220- 14:15.700* :  all Palestinians, not only Hamas. The bloodshed has been going on since 1948.
*14:16.200- 14:21.100* :  These really defense forces say they're trying to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.
*14:21.640- 14:27.740* :  But here, many share that would his views. The death toll in Gaza, especially among children,
*14:27.740- 14:31.680* :  has caused a lot of anger and has reminded them of the past.
*14:36.440- 14:40.460* :  With the refugee problem of Hitler's Europe, still an unhappy and recent memory,
*14:40.540- 14:43.940* :  another of the same kind has been building up in Palestine.
*14:44.580- 14:48.240* :  Thousands of refugees arrived here in Lebanon in 1948.
*14:49.280- 14:53.760* :  Up until May that year, Britain had governed Palestine under a UN mandate
*14:53.760- 14:57.980* :  on a promise to establish a national home there for Jewish people.
*14:58.300- 15:05.320* :  In the war that followed, Israel's declaration of statehood in May 1948, about 700,000 Palestinians
*15:05.320- 15:11.760* :  were expelled or forced from their homes. Palestinians call this the Nekpa or catastrophe.
*15:14.660- 15:18.640* :  Nowadays, thousands of Palestinians here are struggling to survive.
*15:20.300- 15:24.960* :  Because of the sectarian divisions in Lebanon and the Palestinian involvement in the Lebanese
*15:24.960- 15:30.880* :  civil war in the mid-70s, to this day, the Lebanese government does not recognize any rights
*15:30.880- 15:37.320* :  to Palestinian refugees, not even property ownership. And poorly paid jobs are the only ones
*15:37.320- 15:43.280* :  allowed for young people in this camp. The United Nations Agency on Roa has been providing
*15:43.280- 15:50.380* :  help here for decades. As you can see, the camps are 75 years after their displacement,
*15:50.380- 15:56.760* :  substandard, slum environments. Dorothy Klaus heads the agency in Lebanon.
*15:56.760- 16:04.540* :  Security is very bad. Sanitation water is always a problem and is struggling to provide these
*16:04.940- 16:11.560* :  very basic services to the Palestine refugees. It should be standing on their own feet 75 years
*16:12.180- 16:20.740* :  later. So we do hope that the way forward will bring additional resources and also political
*16:20.740- 16:28.280* :  solutions for Palestine refugees. Unable to settle in their present home, most people here
*16:28.280- 16:35.380* :  are still focused on the past and hopeless about the future. Peace process is a need of two parts.
*16:35.860- 16:41.240* :  Dr. Muhammad Khatib runs a museum that collects personal belongings of refugees in Lebanon.
*16:42.180- 16:48.460* :  In a glass cabinet are dozens of old home keys. People kept them in the hope of going back one day.
*16:48.860- 16:57.320* :  Netanyahu do not want a state of Palestine. So what we can do? We are a need of a partner that
*16:57.360- 17:09.560* :  also is okay to the peace. Today, people in the camp have taken to the streets to express solidarity
*17:09.560- 17:16.960* :  to people in Gaza. Kids as young as five are parading, waving the Palestinian flag.
*17:17.920- 17:22.160* :  Generation after generation keeps Palestine in the hearts and minds.
*17:22.380- 17:31.980* :  That report by Lena Sinjab. Next to the Czech Republic, a minute's silence was held
*17:31.980- 17:36.940* :  on Saturday to remember the victims of a gunman who carried out the worst mass shooting in the country's
*17:36.940- 17:42.500* :  history. 14 people were shot dead at a university in the centre of Prague on Thursday. The police
*17:42.500- 17:47.960* :  believed the gunman was also responsible for the deaths of three other people over the past week.
*17:47.960- 17:54.100* :  The president Petra Pavl described the pain and sorrow suffered by the whole of Czech society.
*17:54.620- 17:57.840* :  Our correspondent Sarah Reinsford sent this report from Prague.
*18:01.680- 18:06.940* :  A nation pause to date to remember the victims of an attack people here can't make sense of.
*18:09.380- 18:15.200* :  Church bells rang out across the Czech Republic. At Prague Cathedral, some of the survivors joined
*18:15.200- 18:21.020* :  the congregation. Students and teachers who'd barricaded themselves into classrooms as the gunman
*18:21.020- 18:27.300* :  roamed corridors. We're told most of those who shot were female, but we have no idea of his motive.
*18:28.280- 18:33.900* :  In the end, the 24-year-old, who's been described as a brilliant student, turns the gun on himself.
*18:34.840- 18:39.740* :  The Archbishop in Prague explained that one of the roses laid on the altar was for the gunman.
*18:43.080- 18:48.120* :  In sacrifice, we will bring one rose for each victim to the altar, and we will add another for
*18:48.120- 18:54.240* :  the one who allowed evil to possess and manipulate him so much that he became the tool of horrendous
*18:54.240- 18:59.580* :  deaths. There are shrines outside universities all over the country,
*18:59.580- 19:04.620* :  where there are still big questions about how so many were killed when police had known an
*19:04.620- 19:09.880* :  armed man was heading for Charles University. The interior minister has defended the police
*19:09.880- 19:16.300* :  response to us as swift and professional. For now, the focus here is on remembering those killed
*19:16.780- 19:20.240* :  who should have been returning home to their families this week for Christmas.
*19:25.000- 19:30.880* :  Still to come. This poem is actually going to be on a chip on the side of the Europa Clipper
*19:31.300- 19:38.100* :  mission, and it is going to go on a 1.8 billion mile journey around this icy moon of Jupiter.
*19:50.680- 19:56.240* :  Our world is changing, and with change comes new challenges, from rising sea levels to coastal
*19:56.240- 20:02.980* :  erosion to extreme weather. Communities, scientists, and innovators are addressing the complexity of our

*21:00.140- 21:04.700* :  Something mysterious plagues County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland, and its legendary
*21:04.700- 21:13.680* :  Galic football team. The year is 1951, and County Mayo have just won the sports biggest prize,
*21:13.680- 21:18.840* :  but in the midst of situation, there's a funeral, and for the priest leading the congregation,
*21:18.840- 21:25.920* :  this sacrilege must be punished. A curse exits his lips. Damn nation be upon every one of you.
*21:26.100- 21:32.940* :  It came to pass. Amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get your
*21:32.940- 21:40.320* :  BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News podcast. Just days after registering as a candidate
*21:40.320- 21:45.440* :  for the presidential election in Russia next year, a former television journalist has been barred
*21:45.440- 21:51.400* :  from standing. The disqualified candidate, Katerina Dunsova, had been planning to run on a platform
*21:51.400- 21:57.300* :  of opposition to the war in Ukraine. With most opposition figures in Russia either behind bars,
*21:57.300- 22:03.040* :  like Alexei Navalny or outside the country, President Putin seems almost certain to win a fifth
*22:03.040- 22:08.460* :  term as head of state in March, cementing his decades-long grip on power. The electoral commission
*22:08.460- 22:14.000* :  said Miss Don Sova was banned because of mistakes in her application. But what were they?
*22:14.000- 22:19.960* :  A question for our reporter, Sashesh Viktor. No, Alex, nobody's saying what mistakes they just said,
*22:19.960- 22:26.680* :  there were violations of the procedure for registration. They could have come up with any excuse.
*22:26.680- 22:34.320* :  What's more, nobody knows of Yekaterina Dunsova. She's a former TV journalist. She doesn't
*22:34.320- 22:42.120* :  represent any party. So she was going to run as an independent just to make a statement saying that
*22:42.600- 22:48.660* :  I'm challenging Putin. I don't like his war. I don't like the fact that most of his opponents
*22:48.780- 22:57.380* :  have been incarcerated. I'm against all this. And she just wanted to have the floor. And of course,
*22:57.380- 23:03.940* :  the Kremlin could have just let her do it. But we are now having another completely another
*23:03.940- 23:10.080* :  political climate in Russia from the one that was before the war during the previous election
*23:10.080- 23:19.400* :  campaign. So no dissent will be brooked now. If you hear anybody now mildly criticizing the Kremlin,
*23:19.400- 23:25.460* :  rest assured, this person would have been vetted by the Kremlin because they need the appearance,
*23:25.460- 23:31.900* :  they need the appearance of democracy. Putin wants to be elected even if the election is rigged.
*23:31.900- 23:37.400* :  You know what I mean? It's like for this, he needs all the attributes of an election campaign
*23:37.400- 23:43.720* :  like opposition voices to go on the campaign trail. So it's going to be hard for the opposition to
*23:43.720- 23:49.540* :  win this. But what is the state of the opposition? There is no opposition. All the real critics are
*23:50.200- 23:55.120* :  sitting behind bars. So Navalny is behind bars. We don't even know where he is. He, supposedly,
*23:55.120- 24:00.500* :  he's been moved to another prison, but we don't know which one they never told us. So there is
*24:00.500- 24:05.660* :  the so-called opposition communist party, which has always been the official opposition. But
*24:05.660- 24:12.280* :  everybody says, oh, it's like a vetted party. It's like, you know, it always would get like if Putin
*24:12.280- 24:19.360* :  would get, say, 80 percent of the vote, the communists would get 14, say. So this time is the same
*24:19.360- 24:24.800* :  candidate who had a tone of his already in his 70s. And he said, oh, no, no, I will not,
*24:24.800- 24:31.200* :  I will not challenge Putin. He's his own man. I will just stand as a candidate. But they're all
*24:31.200- 24:35.120* :  afraid even to challenge him. You know, and how do you challenge Putin? If you challenge Putin,
*24:35.120- 24:42.020* :  you have to criticize the war. If you criticize the war, you make yourself liable to imprisonment.
*24:42.360- 24:46.660* :  And then there's another party like, for example, there is a party which is called a just
*24:46.700- 24:53.260* :  Russia for truth party. And it said today that it would support Putin at the election.
*24:53.260- 24:59.860* :  We don't know why. Sasha Schlikta, staying with matters Russian, Moscow said recently it will
*24:59.860- 25:05.580* :  confiscate the income from frozen western assets. If the European Union acts on plans to take
*25:05.580- 25:11.140* :  the profits from frozen Russian companies and hand these to Ukraine, the EU and US are looking
*25:11.140- 25:17.640* :  into ways to tap into the $300 billion of Russia's state frozen assets, the bulk of which is
*25:17.640- 25:23.980* :  held in Europe. This is after they failed to provide two crucial aid packages to keep worth
*25:23.980- 25:28.740* :  more than $100 billion dollars earlier this month due to political disagreements. The financial
*25:28.740- 25:34.880* :  times newspaper has reported that the US is lobbying G7 members to confiscate those assets
*25:34.880- 25:41.020* :  altogether. International lawyers headed by Philip Zellikow, a former senior US diplomat,
*25:41.300- 25:47.200* :  have set out a legal basis for transferring Russian sovereign reserves. He's been telling Sean
*25:47.200- 25:54.100* :  Laymore. Never before in world history has an aggressor carried out a gigantic aggression while
*25:54.100- 25:59.720* :  leaving hundreds of billions of dollars in euros in the accounts of the law abiding countries
*25:59.900- 26:05.600* :  wounded by this aggression. That now creates a circumstance that allows those law abiding countries
*26:06.360- 26:13.000* :  following international law to use that money to compensate the victims of Russia's wrongful
*26:13.000- 26:18.800* :  behavior. This would be done under the international law of state countermeasures. Countermeasures
*26:18.800- 26:25.160* :  is I'm going to violate the ordinary obligations I owe to you because of your prior outlaw
*26:25.160- 26:30.660* :  behavior. That's a long accepted doctrine under international law and it's been applied before,
*26:30.660- 26:37.260* :  for example, when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. All of the Iraq's assets in the West were frozen
*26:37.640- 26:42.480* :  and those assets were eventually transferred to compensate the victims of Iraq's aggression.
*26:42.660- 26:50.920* :  If this idea is not new, if it's been done before, why is there still resistance to it? The Americans
*26:50.940- 26:58.300* :  are trying to persuade other G7 nations at least to agree to this. Why is there resistance?
*26:59.160- 27:05.080* :  There are several reasons. One, the sheer novelty of the scale of it. Yes, it's a large scale move,
*27:05.080- 27:11.480* :  but it's responding to really a historic challenge, a generational challenge. The other part
*27:11.480- 27:17.780* :  of the problem is there's nervousness among central bankers especially about not doing things that
*27:17.780- 27:23.140* :  will discourage people from putting money in their currencies. That's why it's essential
*27:23.140- 27:29.880* :  that all the main reserve currencies move together. If dollar, euro, sterling, yen, all move together,
*27:30.380- 27:35.000* :  well that's 93% of the foreign exchange holdings in the world. It's very important that the
*27:35.000- 27:39.920* :  action be multilateral. This is a point that the European central bankers have stressed, that they
*27:39.920- 27:47.080* :  don't want to go out there alone. A further objection is that some academics are concerned that
*27:47.080- 27:53.720* :  this allows powerful states to use countermeasures and they don't like that. They don't think anything
*27:53.720- 27:59.280* :  should be done unless Russia has consented to it. But then the irony is that the powerful aggressor
*27:59.280- 28:04.960* :  gets to wreck its weak victims and then people are solicitous about the rights of the powerful
*28:04.960- 28:10.240* :  aggressor. There is a final set of concerns that people don't talk about very much. There is a
*28:10.240- 28:15.980* :  widespread sphere of Russian retaliation against their companies and investments in Russia especially.
*28:16.160- 28:21.080* :  That would be unlawful and Russia has already taken these companies hostage and has already
*28:21.080- 28:26.680* :  confiscated the assets of several of them just to show they can. Those companies that Russia
*28:26.680- 28:31.820* :  retaliates against will simply join the line of the victims of Russia's aggression and they'll
*28:31.820- 28:34.700* :  join the ranks of the claimants for compensation.
*28:35.360- 28:42.940* :  Philip Zellico, a former senior US diplomat. Next to the United States and a woman from the state of
*28:42.940- 28:49.440* :  Alabama who was born with two wounds and became pregnant in both, has given birth to baby girls
*28:49.440- 28:56.540* :  one day apart. Kelsey Hatcher, who's 32, described them as her miracle babies, Chantal Hartwell reports.
*28:57.220- 29:02.740* :  The healthy delivery of the two girls named Roxy and Rebel has stunned doctors in Alabama,
*29:02.740- 29:08.160* :  an estimated three and a thousand women born with the condition uterus di-delphis,
*29:08.160- 29:13.380* :  where a double uterus is formed, each with one fallopian tube and one ovary.
*29:13.400- 29:18.360* :  Dr. Richard Davis, a fertility specialist at the University of Alabama Hospital,
*29:18.380- 29:22.980* :  said he had never seen and is unlikely to see a case like this again.
*29:23.560- 29:28.020* :  A double cervix of double uterus is way under one percent, maybe three per thousand
*29:28.760- 29:34.600* :  women might have that. And then the probability of you having a twin in each horn is really
*29:35.980- 29:41.700* :  crazy. Miss Hatcher had three previous healthy pregnancies. This time she believed herself
*29:41.700- 29:47.460* :  to be pregnant in only one uterus, until a routine ultrasound revealed there was also a baby in
*29:47.460- 29:54.680* :  her second. She recalls the moment she broke the news to her husband. I said, well, there's two
*29:54.680- 30:02.620* :  of them in there. He said, you're lying. I said, no, I'm not. After a total of 20 hours in
*30:02.620- 30:08.420* :  labor, Miss Hatcher gave birth to her daughter's one-day apart. Dr. Davis said he believed the two
*30:08.420- 30:14.520* :  girls could be called fraternal twins, because both were in one belly at the same time. As he put it,
*30:14.580- 30:21.240* :  they just had different apartments. Chantal Hartle. Scientists in Australia have raised new fears
*30:21.240- 30:27.120* :  about the collapse of Antarctica's huge western ice sheet, and their research has come from a
*30:27.120- 30:34.480* :  surprising source, octopuses. How? Terry Egan explains. The researchers sequenced the DNA of nearly
*30:34.480- 30:41.040* :  a hundred turkeys octopuses from different areas around the Antarctic and divided them into
*30:41.040- 30:47.780* :  separate populations. They then worked backwards to build various models to explain the different
*30:47.780- 30:55.400* :  ways those octopuses had interbred or not over the centuries. The various populations had acquired
*30:55.400- 31:02.000* :  genetic differences through being separated by thick ice. But the researchers found the octopuses
*31:02.000- 31:08.920* :  resumed interbreeding around a hundred thousand years ago. That's when there was a warmer patch
*31:08.940- 31:16.340* :  between ice ages. Temperatures were about half a degree warmer than now, and that most likely
*31:16.340- 31:23.280* :  is when the western ice sheet collapsed, allowing the different populations to meet and interbreed.
*31:24.200- 31:31.600* :  The finding chimes with the geological evidence, but that figure of half a degree raises alarm bells,
*31:31.600- 31:38.440* :  because some projections suggest we're heading that way now, and that suggests the west
*31:38.460- 31:43.640* :  Antarctic ice sheet could collapse again. Terry Egan
*31:45.040- 31:51.420* :  Next year, a new NASA spacecraft, the Europa Clipper, will hurtle towards Jupiter with the
*31:51.420- 31:56.420* :  intention of finding out whether there could be extra terrestrial life underneath one of its moons.
*31:56.420- 32:01.880* :  The mission will carry more than just high-tech machinery. It will also have onboard a poem by
*32:01.880- 32:08.380* :  the US Poet Laureate Ada Limon, in praise of mystery, a poem for Europa. Alongside the poem will
*32:08.380- 32:13.380* :  be hundreds of thousands of people's names that have been submitted to NASA. Here's a short excerpt
*32:13.380- 32:21.580* :  of the poem, read by Ada Limon. Arching under the night sky, inky with black expansiveness,
*32:21.660- 32:30.120* :  we point to the planets we know. We pin quick wishes on stars. From Earth we read this
*32:30.120- 32:38.380* :  guy as if it is an unhearing book of the universe, expert and evident. The poem was requested for the
*32:38.380- 32:44.980* :  space mission by the head of science, Vanessa, Dr. Nicola Fox. This poem written by Ada Limon,
*32:45.120- 32:50.540* :  it is actually going to be on a chip on the side of the Europa Clipper mission, which will launch
*32:50.540- 32:58.780* :  in October of next year, and it is going to go on a 1.8 billion mile journey out and around this
*32:59.020- 33:04.700* :  icy moon of Jupiter, and we're hoping to find telltale signs that at some time life could have
*33:04.700- 33:11.180* :  been supported. Anyone listening, you can send your name with us. You can have your name put on
*33:11.180- 33:18.320* :  the Europa Clipper spacecraft, Google, NASA, message in a bottle, and you can sign up. The opportunity
*33:18.320- 33:26.860* :  does close on December 31st, so don't wait if you want to join us on a 1.8 billion mile journey
*33:27.320- 33:33.540* :  in our solar system. It's exciting. And I've done it already, Dr. Nicola Fox from NASA.
*33:35.380- 33:40.900* :  Of all the baffling activities that mark British life, Pantamime, also known as Panto,
*33:40.900- 33:48.000* :  must rank pretty high. The theatrical extravaganza appears only at Christmas and features cross-dressing,
*33:48.000- 33:55.000* :  terrible jokes, audience participation, fantastical costumes, singing and dancing, and a really
*33:55.920- 34:01.740* :  limited repertoire of plots. Now, the British government is beginning a consultation to see whether
*34:01.740- 34:08.820* :  it and other typically British traditions should be put forward for United Nations protected status,
*34:08.820- 34:14.900* :  David Solitaire reports. The British government will next year sign up to UNESCO's Convention
*34:14.920- 34:20.700* :  for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage, and he wants to know what people think should
*34:20.700- 34:27.040* :  go on the list. The Convention is a global catalogue of cultural activities that are highly regarded,
*34:27.640- 34:31.940* :  and in some cases in need of preservation. So, should we be adding Panto?
*34:36.640- 34:42.140* :  We'll change rolling. All local crafts. France, Greece and Spain all have drystone,
*34:42.140- 34:46.740* :  walling on their list. Should it be on ours? Belgium has traditional beer-making.
*34:47.320- 34:51.220* :  India, yoga, Audrentina and Uruguay, tango.
*34:53.300- 34:59.040* :  Our Morris Dancing or the Highland Fling cultural treasures the government would like to know.
*35:00.680- 35:01.480* :  David Solitaire.
*35:04.980- 35:12.300* :  And that's all from us for now, but before we go, let's hear about the happy news review for 2023.
*35:12.300- 35:18.700* :  Here's Jackie. Yes, and I guarantee that there were more positive stories in 2023 than you think
*35:18.700- 35:24.280* :  there were, so we will be reminding you that jaw-dropping rescue from the dangling cable car in
*35:24.280- 35:30.820* :  Pakistan. That's it. Also, good news for blue whales in the seashells. A new affordable malaria
*35:30.820- 35:37.720* :  vaccine. The beautiful art still being uncovered in Pompeii. The kids who survived 40 days lost in the
*35:37.720- 35:44.120* :  Colombian jungle and the marvel that is Simone Biles, and much more, of course, all in the Global
