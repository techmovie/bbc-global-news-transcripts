*00:00.060- 00:04.020* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service
*00:04.020- 00:06.580* :  with reports and analysis from across the world,
*00:06.580- 00:08.740* :  the latest news seven days a week.
*00:09.200- 00:12.580* :  BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:33.220- 00:35.940* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:38.180- 00:42.280* :  I'm Robin Brant and in the early hours of Sunday the 31st of December,
*00:42.280- 00:46.480* :  these are our main stories. After a massive aerial attack on Ukraine,
*00:46.480- 00:51.600* :  Russia now suffers a retaliatory bombardment with reports of 18 dead.
*00:52.220- 00:57.060* :  It's the most concentrated number of Russian deaths we've seen in these strikes,
*00:57.060- 01:00.240* :  and Ukraine is saying it launched a more than 70 drone.
*01:00.240- 01:05.140* :  Israel's Prime Minister has warned that the war in Gaza could go on for many more months,
*01:05.140- 01:08.800* :  as his military extends its offensive in the south,
*01:09.420- 01:12.740* :  and there's division in Switzerland about whether to call wolves.
*01:13.080- 01:15.840* :  The safety issue of the wolf has been greatly exaggerated,
*01:15.840- 01:18.340* :  and the truth is that there hasn't been a single death,
*01:18.620- 01:23.860* :  or even a single instance of an aggressive wolf in Switzerland since the 1990s when they returned.
*01:23.860- 01:30.120* :  Also in this podcast, a female champion wrestler has returned her medals
*01:30.120- 01:34.120* :  to highlight sexual harassment of other women athletes in India.
*01:34.480- 01:39.840* :  And it was only a few years ago that I didn't know anything about this world,
*01:40.360- 01:42.400* :  and now I'm still amazed at what I can achieve.
*01:42.900- 01:47.240* :  The Britain who's skied across Antarctica in what looks like record time.
*01:50.680- 01:55.540* :  Let's start this podcast in Russia, which has been hit by one of the biggest waves of aerial attacks
*01:55.540- 02:01.220* :  since it started the war in Ukraine. It comes just a day after Russia's bombardment of Ukraine.
*02:01.260- 02:07.580* :  18 people are reported dead in Belgorod, a city about 30 kilometers from the Ukrainian border
*02:07.860- 02:11.820* :  in Russia's southwest after it was struck by drones and missiles.
*02:12.540- 02:16.040* :  Moscow has since retaliated by striking at central Khakhiv.
*02:16.360- 02:21.040* :  Officials said 20 people were injured there, including an unnamed British journalist.
*02:21.780- 02:25.480* :  For the latest, from Khiv, Ben James, heard from James Waterhouse.
*02:26.240- 02:31.300* :  Usually, Khiv is a little bit coy when it comes to officially admitting responsibilities for
*02:31.300- 02:37.760* :  drone attacks like this into Russian territory. We've seen it before in the Belgorod region,
*02:37.760- 02:43.700* :  as well as towards Moscow itself. But this time around, it was definitive, yes,
*02:43.700- 02:48.920* :  this is, in response to the unprecedented aerial bombardment that Ukraine endured yesterday
*02:48.920- 02:54.780* :  when Russia launched more than 150 missiles, killing 39 people and injuring many more.
*02:55.420- 03:00.400* :  In terms of what we're seeing in Belgorod and the nearby city of Briansk inside Russia,
*03:00.860- 03:05.660* :  it's the most concentrated number of Russian deaths we've seen in these strikes.
*03:05.660- 03:08.840* :  And Ukraine is saying it launched more than 70 drones.
*03:09.060- 03:12.540* :  So that gives you an idea of how it was keen to apply this response.
*03:12.540- 03:18.460* :  It's saying that they were targeting military sites, but the collateral damage here in
*03:18.460- 03:21.580* :  that civilians appear to have lost their lives too, according to Russian officials.
*03:21.820- 03:24.240* :  Clearly, that was a collateral damage, though, willing to accept.
*03:24.240- 03:28.460* :  But there's also a psychological element here, as well, where if you're Ukraine,
*03:28.460- 03:34.140* :  if you start targeting neighboring Russian towns and cities and people start seeing blown out windows,
*03:34.140- 03:40.300* :  destroyed cars like they've seen today, it's harder for them to ignore Russia's continued invasion
*03:40.300- 03:41.660* :  of its western neighbour.
*03:42.060- 03:46.320* :  And tonight we're hearing about more strikes on Ukraine in Kharkiv.
*03:46.320- 03:50.480* :  Is that a continuation, it seems, of this exchange over the past few days?
*03:51.000- 03:52.300* :  Yeah, it's a bit of a strange one, really.
*03:52.540- 03:56.320* :  Kharkiv is a place we were staying at until about three days ago,
*03:56.760- 04:00.720* :  and the Kharkiv Palace Hotel was where we were, and it's been directly hit.
*04:01.100- 04:05.820* :  And so there's a lot of damage, and you wonder how the staff are doing there,
*04:05.820- 04:09.040* :  and we were told by officials that a number of sites in the city,
*04:09.560- 04:12.280* :  including a medical facility and residential blocks have been hit,
*04:12.280- 04:18.000* :  and the Kremlin vowed in its words that the actions of Ukraine wouldn't go unpunished,
*04:18.400- 04:19.820* :  and it seems it's not waiting around.
*04:19.820- 04:22.580* :  I mean, Kharkiv in Jewish missile strikes frequently.
*04:22.580- 04:26.420* :  Just to give you an idea, yesterday, more than 20 missiles are fired at it.
*04:26.720- 04:31.200* :  And so it feels like, alongside the fighting we see on the front lines,
*04:31.240- 04:33.520* :  this kind of aerial bombardment that we're seeing,
*04:33.520- 04:35.660* :  Ukraine's ability to respond in kind,
*04:35.660- 04:40.540* :  we're seeing a real escalation in both sides trying to target civilian areas,
*04:40.540- 04:43.300* :  but we have to apply the context here that it is Ukraine
*04:43.300- 04:48.100* :  that weathered these strikes far more frequently on a much greater scale than it is Russia.
*04:48.860- 04:50.900* :  James Waterhouse reporting from Kiev.
*04:51.500- 04:55.680* :  Now, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the war in Gaza
*04:56.060- 04:58.320* :  will continue for many more months to come.
*04:58.920- 05:02.300* :  In a defiant TV address, he vowed to eliminate Hamas,
*05:02.320- 05:04.720* :  and bring the remaining hostages home.
*05:05.340- 05:08.840* :  He spoke of a complex operation, but said Israel had the upper hand.
*05:11.820- 05:12.980* :  The war is in full swing.
*05:13.220- 05:14.760* :  We are fighting on all fronts.
*05:14.760- 05:18.040* :  We have great successes, but we also have painful prices.
*05:18.960- 05:20.920* :  Achieving victory requires more time.
*05:21.780- 05:23.060* :  My policy is very clear.
*05:23.060- 05:28.280* :  We are going to continue fighting until we've achieved all the objectives of this war.
*05:28.760- 05:30.440* :  His comments on Saturday night,
*05:30.440- 05:35.120* :  calm as Israeli tanks pushed deeper into parts of central and southern Gaza.
*05:35.180- 05:40.960* :  In the city of Khan Yunus, the Israeli army says it's recovered what it claimed was very valuable
*05:40.960- 05:43.920* :  intelligence material from Hamas sites.
*05:44.520- 05:47.420* :  From Jerusalem, his are Middle East correspondent Yuland Nel.
*05:50.260- 05:54.440* :  Street battles between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters have been intense in
*05:54.440- 05:58.220* :  Khairn Yunus, seen as a stronghold of the armed group in southern Gaza.
*05:58.740- 06:02.480* :  And Israeli warplanes have continued to strike the urban refugee camps
*06:02.480- 06:06.560* :  in the center of the territory ahead of a further advance by ground troops.
*06:07.180- 06:10.340* :  Overwhelmed hospitals are still struggling to treat the wounded.
*06:10.380- 06:14.240* :  While Israel says it's not limiting aid allowed into Gaza,
*06:14.240- 06:18.480* :  the UN has complained that the amount getting through remains woefully inadequate.
*06:19.120- 06:22.680* :  Thomas White, the Gaza director of Umrua, told me about the challenges.
*06:23.020- 06:25.660* :  It's very difficult to get aid into Gaza.
*06:26.220- 06:28.480* :  It's a very long and convoluted process.
*06:29.220- 06:33.640* :  And then once the aids in Gaza, you know, it's very difficult to get aid to people.
*06:33.720- 06:36.060* :  Essentially, we're delivering aid under fire.
*06:38.820- 06:42.900* :  Along the border with Egypt, Palestinian families set up makeshift tents.
*06:43.360- 06:46.680* :  Aerial footage shows a sprawling crowded campsite.
*06:47.260- 06:52.760* :  Tens of thousands of garsens have fled the ongoing fighting, heading towards Raffa in recent days.
*06:53.640- 06:57.200* :  With the vast majority of people in Gaza now displaced from their homes,
*06:57.200- 07:01.840* :  UN health officials say they're seeing a rise in the spread of infectious diseases.
*07:02.620- 07:05.460* :  Well, that was Yolanda Nell reporting from Jerusalem.
*07:06.280- 07:11.560* :  In Nicaragua, the country's president, Daniel Altega, has overseen a further crackdown on the
*07:11.560- 07:17.500* :  Catholic Church. In the past few days, priests, critical of his long-serving left-wing government,
*07:18.000- 07:20.580* :  have reportedly been taken from their homes and arrested.
*07:21.340- 07:24.960* :  Ever since mass protest was ignited across the country in 2018,
*07:25.560- 07:29.200* :  relations between Altega and the Catholic Church have become strained.
*07:29.760- 07:32.960* :  Our America's original editor, Leonardo Rosci, explained more.
*07:33.740- 07:39.220* :  The information is very scarce. It's coming from the opposition and from church sources,
*07:39.220- 07:45.120* :  people who are basically outside Nicaragua. Because the main newspaper, La Prensa,
*07:45.120- 07:48.980* :  they had to leave the country and then are operating from Costa Rica.
*07:49.360- 07:53.760* :  So, what we know is that seven people have been arrested overnight,
*07:53.760- 07:58.740* :  priests not only in the capital, Managua, but in other locations as well.
*07:58.740- 08:05.160* :  If you go back about a week from the 20th, you have about 12 to 14 priests and people
*08:05.160- 08:08.000* :  linked to the Catholic Church in Nicaragua who have been arrested.
*08:08.240- 08:13.420* :  Just tell us a bit about why the relationship between the Catholic Church and Altega's
*08:13.740- 08:17.440* :  government has deteriorated so much over the last four or five years.
*08:17.660- 08:23.640* :  To start with, Danielo Altega is a former Marxist rebel, so his relations with the church
*08:23.640- 08:30.380* :  were never ideal. But for many years, he's been in power since 2007, will be 17 years now,
*08:30.380- 08:35.260* :  in January. So, his relationship with the church was okay for a long time.
*08:35.620- 08:39.960* :  Out of the blue, you had protests in 2018. You had mass street protests,
*08:40.500- 08:44.140* :  started for some other reason and took the government totally by surprise.
*08:44.140- 08:49.640* :  And their response was very forceful. More than 300 people, most of them, young or
*08:49.640- 08:55.440* :  position activists were killed. So, what the church did is then, the Catholic Church and Catholic
*08:55.440- 09:00.760* :  priests, they came out and they denounced a violation of human rights. They tried to protect
*09:00.760- 09:05.700* :  those people and the government then accused them of being part of a plot
*09:06.200- 09:11.260* :  led by the United States to oust his government. So, that's when the relationship deteriorates
*09:11.260- 09:16.560* :  from in the past four or five years. So, given his political leanings, I mean, this is like what
*09:16.560- 09:21.200* :  we saw in Poland, 45 years ago, what we see in China now, or I used to live, it's a kind of a
*09:21.200- 09:25.940* :  fear or a deep skepticism of organized religion because they believe it poses a threat.
*09:26.140- 09:30.160* :  Yes, and with the Catholic Church, what happened in Poland as well, there's a
*09:30.160- 09:36.200* :  dual allegiance. You know, people are in the caragmas, but they also obey or respect
*09:36.200- 09:40.920* :  what the church or the Vatican are saying. So, there's a power that comes from the outside,
*09:40.920- 09:45.580* :  what people believe that's been happening now, this latest crackdown on the church,
*09:45.580- 09:51.100* :  is that earlier this year in February, more than 200 people were exiled from Nicaragua,
*09:51.100- 09:56.380* :  as part of a deal, including 12 priests and one of them, a bishop, Rolando Alvarus,
*09:56.380- 10:01.280* :  refused to go in the last minute and about a month later or two months later, he was sentenced
*10:01.280- 10:07.060* :  to 26 years in prison and he became sort of a martyr and the Pope has been talking about them.
*10:07.120- 10:11.360* :  So, what is believed is that all those priests have been mentioning him in sermons,
*10:11.360- 10:16.660* :  in church. Let's pray for Rolando Alvarus and anyone that mentioned him was then arrested.
*10:17.240- 10:21.060* :  Leonardo Rossia with the latest on Nicaragua and the Catholic Church.
*10:22.200- 10:27.740* :  Wolf numbers have been rising in Europe for more than 50 years now, so much so that in some places
*10:27.740- 10:33.220* :  like Switzerland, they cull the animals to control the population. But a court there has been
*10:33.220- 10:37.660* :  asked to intervene and decide if the wolves roaming its mountains are dangerous predators
*10:37.660- 10:44.060* :  that need driving out or a precious part of a delicate ecosystem. Imogen folks has more.
*10:45.000- 10:49.960* :  The wolf definitely has a place, it's a builder of ecosystems, Switzerland is big enough
*10:49.960- 10:57.500* :  for between 55 and 100 packs. I'm with Environmental Campaigner, Lucy Nutri,
*10:58.100- 11:04.920* :  out enjoying the Swiss landscape. The views are spectacular, green pastures, thick forests,
*11:04.920- 11:11.240* :  the Alps rising in the distance. Switzerland is also a densely populated country,
*11:11.260- 11:15.840* :  but Lucy's been telling me we've got nothing to fear from wolves.
*11:16.200- 11:20.660* :  The safety issue of the wolf has been greatly exaggerated and the truth is that there hasn't been
*11:20.660- 11:26.700* :  a single death or even a single instance of an aggressive wolf in Switzerland since the 1990s
*11:26.700- 11:33.840* :  when they returned. So all this is nonsense. But Lucy's talking about danger to people,
*11:34.340- 11:39.200* :  sheep on the other hand do need to be worried. Just last week a few miles from here,
*11:39.680- 11:46.420* :  a wolf attacked and killed 11 of them. Sandro Mikhail explains why the farmers' association
*11:46.420- 11:54.120* :  backed the wolf call. The main problem is in high Alpine farming. Every morning the farmers are
*11:54.120- 11:59.340* :  finding dead sheep. We've tried sheep dogs, fences, shepherds, 90 percent of farms have these,
*11:59.340- 12:03.560* :  but the sheep keep getting attacked. We've got night cameras that have recorded wolves jumping
*12:03.560- 12:12.400* :  over the fences back and forth minute by minute. To the farmer's disappointment the coal which
*12:12.400- 12:18.220* :  would have allowed the complete elimination of a number of Switzerland's 32 wolf packs has been
*12:18.220- 12:25.200* :  suspended. Lucy says the stay of execution is good for the environment. Wolves by
*12:25.200- 12:30.760* :  predating on certain animals they create habitats for others, they also prevent the damage to forests.
*12:30.760- 12:37.720* :  We have too many deer that are eating and destroying young trees and in certain forests in Switzerland,
*12:37.720- 12:43.880* :  the deer are responsible for actually changing the species composition of forests. So wolves are very
*12:43.880- 12:49.640* :  much part of Switzerland and we ought to welcome them back. But now the European Union underpressure
*12:49.640- 12:56.980* :  like Switzerland from its farmers is also planning to control rising wolf numbers. To be acroed
*12:56.980- 13:04.100* :  of wild Europe a group which promotes the restoration of wilderness areas argues the farming lobby's
*13:04.100- 13:12.980* :  power far outweighs its economic benefits. It reflects an increasingly outdated view of the relatively
*13:12.980- 13:19.540* :  proportionate importance of the various sectors of the economy if you like. Never mind the ecological
*13:20.420- 13:26.960* :  situation. You take Switzerland, agriculture as a whole provides about 0.6% of gross domestic
*13:26.960- 13:32.940* :  product. An upland grazing which is the subset that we're talking about is much much lower still.
*13:34.840- 13:40.980* :  But that says Sandro Mikael is in opinion Swiss farmers find worrying and deeply insulting
*13:40.980- 13:47.280* :  to their alpine traditions. If you really think like that you have to ask if these people even
*13:47.280- 13:52.340* :  want our mountain farmers. We need to compromise. As farmers we don't want to eradicate wolves in
*13:52.340- 13:56.560* :  Switzerland or Europe but we need to regulate them. Otherwise coexistence between livestock
*13:56.560- 14:03.320* :  and wolf in a farming country like Switzerland I don't see it. Peaceful coexistence between
*14:03.320- 14:09.500* :  humans and animals is at the heart of this debate. Everyone seems to want it but no one really
*14:09.500- 14:16.460* :  agrees on how many wolves are too many. Imagine folks reporting. Now recognize this sound?
*14:19.140- 14:25.540* :  Well there will be lots of corks yes that was a cork popping to celebrate the onset of 2024 but
*14:25.540- 14:30.880* :  when the parties are over for some those new years resolutions begin and that can mean putting
*14:30.880- 14:36.920* :  away alcohol for a month. Dry January has become an increasingly popular phenomenon here in the
*14:36.920- 14:43.240* :  UK and other countries but not so in France. With all its world class wines and champagne the
*14:43.240- 14:49.760* :  French have a reputation for being refined drinkers. But 45 academics and doctors have signed a letter
*14:49.760- 14:54.640* :  urging the French government to promote an official period of abstention from alcohol.
*14:55.380- 15:00.600* :  My colleague Caroline Wyatt asked the French journalist Anna Elizabeth Mutay whether the no drinking
*15:00.600- 15:07.340* :  challenge is likely to catch on in France like it has here. I've not heard it so much. I mean it has
*15:07.860- 15:14.280* :  not made the kind of splash that dry January which is a thing in Britain has. We've never heard
*15:14.280- 15:19.600* :  licensing hours in France and the one thing you could find even at times of rationing tickets
*15:19.600- 15:25.960* :  just after the war was still wine. I remember when I was operated in the in the eighties that
*15:26.140- 15:31.560* :  grown-ups had wine at hospital or their hospital clutter that came you know when people were
*15:31.560- 15:37.940* :  given food. Is there though more of the binge drinking as it was known in France these days?
*15:38.200- 15:42.880* :  There is more binge drinking in France than there used to be. You don't have the sights that you
*15:42.880- 15:48.760* :  do have in Britain on Saturday nights which are sort of pretty amazing but it started a bit.
*15:49.000- 15:54.640* :  France is the second biggest consumer of wine in the world so presumably French politician still
*15:54.640- 15:58.980* :  listen pretty closely to the country's wine industry. It's a big big employer of something
*15:58.980- 16:04.420* :  like half a million people. It is a big employer and there's more than that it is absolutely part
*16:04.420- 16:09.220* :  of the culture and some of the French wines that are being produced as you know are so expensive
*16:09.220- 16:13.980* :  that most French people can't afford them anymore because they're so prized and then there's
*16:13.980- 16:20.800* :  a secondary industry of good average wine and that is better than in most places and it's affordable.
*16:21.440- 16:28.940* :  There's also also some new wine makers and they do biociclicle wines and they do green wines so
*16:28.940- 16:34.740* :  there's a whole culture of this being something like an art just as the French lunch has become
*16:35.340- 16:41.780* :  one listed as part of the intangible cultural heritage of France by UNESCO. Wine is definitely part
*16:41.780- 16:46.880* :  of the the French cultural heritage we see it like that. Where does President Macron stand on all this?
*16:47.020- 16:52.860* :  Where he drinks which is a big difference with his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy who was a tea
*16:52.860- 16:56.980* :  totaler because he didn't like the taste and François Hollande who was not very big on wine
*16:56.980- 17:02.580* :  and he he has one of two glasses of wine at lunch and dinner and he says Amir without wine is
*17:02.580- 17:09.380* :  really a bit sad so he is for many reasons including of course all the wonderful tax income
*17:09.900- 17:14.080* :  that comes from selling wine he's more in favor of wine but I also think that he sees the cultural
*17:14.080- 17:22.300* :  part of it. Well that was the French journalist and Elizabeth Mute still to come on the global news
*17:22.300- 17:29.380* :  podcast. One that I do love playing mainly because it's message of positivity is your smooths epic
*17:29.420- 17:41.060* :  promised land. We have top tips for tunes to dance your way into 2024 from a famous club DJ.
*17:49.680- 17:55.460* :  Welcome back to the global news podcast. Now people in the Sudanese city of Niala have taken to
*17:55.460- 18:01.600* :  the streets to denounce bomb attacks allegedly perpetrated by the Sudanese army. Some reports
*18:01.600- 18:07.660* :  suggest more than 100 civilians were either killed or badly wounded in Friday's barrel bomb attacks
*18:07.660- 18:13.080* :  on the capital of South Darfur State. The airstrikes are said to have targeted positions of the
*18:13.080- 18:18.300* :  paramilitary rapid support forces. Our Africa editor Richard Hamilton has more.
*18:19.100- 18:24.520* :  Witnesses said the airstrikes caused widespread destruction leaving dozens of homes raised to
*18:24.520- 18:30.680* :  the ground and forcing thousands to flee for their safety. The latest airstrike comes just weeks
*18:30.680- 18:36.800* :  after the Sudanese Air Force is alleged to have targeted the army headquarters in Niala which has
*18:36.800- 18:43.360* :  been under the control of the rapid support forces since October. A local human rights group Darfur
*18:43.360- 18:49.640* :  Justice platform condemned the attacks on populated areas describing them as war crimes.
*18:50.420- 18:56.820* :  The rsf called them tragic and heinous. The army has not yet commented on the accusations.
*18:57.100- 19:02.400* :  Richard Hamilton. Now let's go to India where one of the country's top female wrestlers,
*19:02.400- 19:08.140* :  Vinesh Polgat, has returned two sports awards given by the government because she wants to
*19:08.140- 19:14.160* :  highlight alleged sexual harassment of female athletes. She and several wrestlers accused the
*19:14.160- 19:20.160* :  former president of the Indian Wrestling Federation, Brej Brushan Shahran Singh, of sexual harassment.
*19:20.160- 19:25.460* :  He denies the charges. From Delhi, here's our South Asia correspondent Ambrassan Etirajah.
*19:26.040- 19:31.600* :  In a symbolic move, Vinesh Polgat, a world championship medalist, left the two prestigious awards
*19:31.600- 19:37.520* :  by the roadside curb in the Indian capital after she was refused to permission to meet Prime Minister
*19:37.520- 19:43.940* :  Narendra Modi. She said, such honors had become meaningless at a time when wrestlers were struggling
*19:43.940- 19:49.860* :  to get justice. Pogat and several other female athletes accused Brej Brushan Shahran Singh,
*19:49.860- 19:56.340* :  an influential MP from the governing BJP of sexual harassment. He has denied the allegations.
*19:56.340- 20:02.100* :  A court is hearing sexual harassment and criminal intimidation charges against Mr. Singh.
*20:02.100- 20:08.280* :  A close associate of Mr. Singh was chosen as the new president of the federation earlier this month,
*20:08.280- 20:14.520* :  triggering angry protests by the wrestlers. Another prominent female wrestler, Sakshimalik,
*20:14.720- 20:19.260* :  said she was quitting the sport in protest at the election of Mr. Singh's loyalist.
*20:19.260- 20:24.640* :  The Indian sports ministry has suspended the newly elected governing body of the wrestling
*20:24.640- 20:30.360* :  federation, accusing it of ignoring rules by hastily announcing junior championships.
*20:30.360- 20:37.860* :  Ambrassan Etirajah reporting. Now, China has expelled nine senior military officers from its
*20:37.860- 20:42.920* :  parliament, the National People's Congress. They include four generals of the army's strategic
*20:42.920- 20:47.940* :  missile force, where there have been reports of a corruption investigation within the military.
*20:48.580- 20:53.760* :  My colleague Rachel Wright asked our Asia-Pacific regional editor, Celia Hatton, why they were kicked out.
*20:54.600- 20:59.880* :  Well, we don't have any official reason hasn't been given, but as you just said,
*20:59.880- 21:06.560* :  there's been swirling rumors for quite some time of an anti-corruption investigation that's
*21:06.900- 21:11.760* :  coursing through the military. Now, the key thing is that these army officials, now that they've
*21:11.760- 21:19.720* :  been dropped from parliament, they've now lost their immunity from legal prosecution. And all of
*21:19.720- 21:26.860* :  this, Rachel, really relates back to August, when China's then defense minister disappeared from
*21:26.860- 21:33.180* :  public view, had to cancel a number of high-profile summits because he wasn't able to attend. Then in
*21:33.180- 21:39.040* :  October, we found out that this man, Lee Shang-Fu, had simply been dropped from his post of
*21:39.040- 21:44.600* :  defense minister, one of China's top positions, and we got no explanation. Now, the rumors that
*21:44.600- 21:50.440* :  have been swirling around is that this all relates back to Lee Shang-Fu's time when he was in charge
*21:50.440- 21:56.920* :  of procuring military equipment for China's military, a really important post. And it's thought that
*21:56.920- 22:02.700* :  maybe there were some corrupt deals relating to that, that have taken him out of his post and have
*22:02.700- 22:09.440* :  taken a number of military officials out of their posts, including the nine today. So we're all just
*22:10.280- 22:15.640* :  waiting to see how this will stem down. But this is just the latest batch of officials that
*22:15.640- 22:21.320* :  seemed to have been abruptly removed from their posts without any real explanation. You mentioned
*22:21.320- 22:26.180* :  the defense minister and other ministers have also gone missing. Yeah, that's right. So China's
*22:26.180- 22:31.160* :  foreign minister was also removed from his post without explanation earlier this year.
*22:31.160- 22:37.640* :  Qin Gang was thought to be a key ally of China's leader, Xi Jinping, just like Lee Shang-Fu, the two of
*22:37.640- 22:44.260* :  them actually, the former defense minister and former foreign minister were both allies of the
*22:44.260- 22:49.680* :  top leader. They both disappeared from view. So the foreign minister also disappeared without
*22:49.680- 22:54.760* :  explanation. It was then sort of abruptly announced that he wouldn't be returning to his post and he
*22:54.760- 23:00.540* :  was replaced. So we have two men who really were very close to Xi Jinping who are now gone. And
*23:00.540- 23:05.680* :  that really leaves Xi Jinping looking a little bit lonely because he's really risen up through the
*23:05.680- 23:12.300* :  ranks by ejecting his rivals from power, but also by promoting his allies. And these are two men
*23:12.340- 23:16.440* :  who we thought would probably stay in their post for quite some time who are now just gone.
*23:17.300- 23:23.760* :  Celia Hatton reporting, cast your mind back to 32 days ago. What were you doing? Well,
*23:23.760- 23:30.120* :  Pete Chandy was starting out on a mission to ski alone across Antarctica and it looks like she's
*23:30.120- 23:36.280* :  done it in record time. She battled temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius and journeyed through
*23:36.280- 23:41.560* :  severe snowstorms to get there. After reaching the South Pole, she posted this reaction on her social
*23:41.560- 23:47.640* :  media. I honestly didn't know if I would be quick enough but thought I'll do everything I can
*23:47.760- 23:53.120* :  and we'll see. This was a solar expedition but there are so many people that have helped me get
*23:53.120- 23:59.600* :  here. It was only a few years ago that I didn't know anything about this world. Now I'm still
*23:59.600- 24:03.920* :  amazed at what I can achieve. There is a bit of an important caveat on this though,
*24:03.920- 24:09.940* :  before Chandy can claim the title, the Guinness World Records must verify it, a process which could
*24:09.940- 24:14.480* :  take several months. Well, the newsrooms Madeline Drury talked me through her achievement.
*24:15.220- 24:19.300* :  Well, I don't know what you're up to at halftew in the morning, UK time on Thursday, Robin,
*24:19.300- 24:24.040* :  but that's when Pete Chandy claims that she reached the South Pole after covering
*24:24.040- 24:31.100* :  1,130 kilometres on his skis. So from my rough calculations, that's a bit like walking
*24:31.100- 24:37.340* :  from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Toulouse in the South of France. She says it took her 31 days,
*24:37.340- 24:42.440* :  30 hours and 90 minutes and I expect those vital minutes are what the Guinness World Record
*24:42.440- 24:47.780* :  Team, as you say, will be verifying over the coming weeks. The previous record holder for the
*24:47.780- 24:53.560* :  fastest unsupported female expedition was a Canadian woman called Caroline Couty and if
*24:53.560- 24:58.180* :  Pete's record gets the thumbs up from the Guinness World Record Team, then Pete has beaten
*24:58.180- 25:04.680* :  Caroline's record by one day, 14 hours and 34 minutes. Now, we are sitting here in a relatively
*25:04.680- 25:09.320* :  warm studio talking about skiing for 31 days on the Antarctic. I mean, just tell us a bit about
*25:09.320- 25:15.280* :  how she actually did it. She's set off alone back in late November from the Hercules Inlet,
*25:15.280- 25:19.240* :  which is a popular starting point for many people attempting their adventures on the continent.
*25:19.900- 25:24.460* :  So just picture this. The sun is beating down this endless vista of white infant of
*25:24.460- 25:30.500* :  Pete and she's carrying a 75 kilogram sled with all of her kits alone. That's everything she
*25:30.500- 25:35.340* :  needed to survive, including freeze-dried food, perhaps a bit of chocolate and fruit in there to
*25:35.340- 25:40.700* :  keep her going as well. And on average, she says she was skiing for 12 to 13 hours a day.
*25:41.340- 25:45.880* :  In her day job, she's a British Army medical officer and has previously broken two world
*25:45.880- 25:51.200* :  records for another polar expedition. So she's good at what she does. Their records she'd
*25:51.200- 25:56.580* :  broken there with the longest polar ski journey by a woman and the overall record for the same
*25:56.920- 26:01.920* :  journey. Despite these adventures in Antarctica that she's already had, she says she's just
*26:01.920- 26:07.320* :  feeling like she's dipping her toes in an ocean and expects someone could come along in time and
*26:07.320- 26:12.600* :  potentially break her own record and she's happy to help them with that when they do.
*26:13.320- 26:16.560* :  Madeline Drury and I'm just going to give you a few seconds to think about that,
*26:16.560- 26:21.940* :  skiing for 12 or 13 hours a day on your own across Antarctica.
*26:23.180- 26:27.820* :  Okay, finally, what are you going to do to celebrate the New Year? Perhaps you're
*26:27.820- 26:31.240* :  planning to go out for the evening or maybe you're staying in and invite some friends around,
*26:31.240- 26:37.620* :  have a bit of a do. Well, who better to suggest some music to see in 2024 than Grand Park?
*26:37.620- 26:43.120* :  The former resident DJ at Manchester's iconic Hasse and a nightclub. Now, I've been told to say
*26:43.120- 26:48.540* :  this next bit by the producer of this podcast who spent many a night partying there back in the
*26:48.540- 26:54.160* :  1980s apparently. Well, Grand Park has been going through his recommended playlist with my colleague,
*26:54.420- 26:54.920* :  Caroline White.
*27:00.000- 27:08.780* :  I find that because it's New Zeve, because everyone's ready to party, to say goodbye to the year
*27:08.780- 27:14.500* :  and welcome in the New Year, I always go for something absolutely massive that's going to bring
*27:14.500- 27:19.400* :  a massive smile to everyone's face while they all hug each other and think of people who can't
*27:19.580- 27:23.840* :  celebrate New Zeve, so I would always go big. What are the obvious ones?
*27:24.200- 27:28.580* :  Allison Limerick will love lives or a Robin S. Show me love.
*27:37.360- 27:42.760* :  They always work really well, but one that I do love playing mainly because its message of
*27:42.760- 27:46.700* :  positivity is Joe Smooth's epic promised land.
*28:02.340- 28:06.540* :  I think that would be my number one choice. As someone who's been doing this every weekend since
*28:06.540- 28:13.540* :  the early 80s, I personally love mixing up the old and the new and new generations of clubbers
*28:13.680- 28:16.900* :  love to hear old records where they can imagine what it was like.
*28:26.060- 28:30.240* :  What do you do about the clock striking midnight? Do you have the bombs?
*28:30.300- 28:36.860* :  I do have the bombs. Back in the day, it would be a BBC sound effects workshop record.
*28:43.920- 28:50.440* :  I'm looking at my watch, I know exactly what time to press play on Big Ben so that the first
*28:50.440- 28:55.500* :  bomb is exactly on midnight. I'm sounding very geeky here, but I love it.
*29:11.980- 29:19.000* :  The first word of the first vocal will start right after the first bomb and everybody
*29:19.740- 29:34.400* :  goes absolutely mental. I think about to end the evening. What would you play as your last one?
*29:34.720- 29:38.200* :  If you have the opportunity to play one more tune, then you've got to decide whether to
*29:38.820- 29:47.340* :  take it down or ramp it up so I quite often will drop my brand new heavies back to love, remix,
*29:47.340- 29:53.880* :  the acupeller of my remix ends with the vocals repeating, brother is going to need it, sister says you
*29:53.880- 29:59.600* :  need it, we're all going to need it one day, we seem to lose our way, somehow I get led astray,
*29:59.900- 30:03.000* :  that's why I'm here to say gotta get back to it now.
*30:20.120- 30:25.760* :  Grand Parks New Year's Air Playlist ending our last episode of the Global News Podcast for 2023.
*30:28.560- 30:32.080* :  Well that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of course of the Global News
*30:32.080- 30:37.380* :  Podcast at the same time tomorrow. Now as we head towards the new year we want to hear about stories
*30:37.380- 30:43.380* :  which are important to you and that maybe can feature on the podcast in 2024. If you have something
*30:43.380- 30:48.580* :  you think others will be interested in and the BBC could report on then send us an email with
*30:48.580- 30:55.780* :  the details. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on ex formerly known as
