*00:52.200- 00:58.000* :  on college campuses in the United States amidst growing protests against Israel's military action
*00:58.000- 01:04.360* :  in Gaza. The resulting congressional hearing has caused an uproar over free speech at US universities.

*01:19.940- 01:23.220* :  You're listening to the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:25.220- 01:29.760* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is being recorded at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday,
*01:29.760- 01:35.440* :  the 20th of December. Donald Trump has to appeal to the US Supreme Court after he was disqualified
*01:35.440- 01:41.480* :  from the Republican presidential primary in Colorado. The leader of Hamas holds talks in Egypt as
*01:41.480- 01:46.660* :  calls grow for another pause in the fighting in Gaza. And the new Polish government dismisses the
*01:46.660- 01:51.680* :  state media authorities, which critics said had been an outlet for propaganda under the previous
*01:51.680- 01:59.100* :  administration. Also in the podcast, a former US marine detained in Russia tells the BBC he's
*01:59.100- 02:03.360* :  been abandoned by his own country. I know that the US has come up with all sorts of proposals,
*02:03.360- 02:08.000* :  serious proposals, but it's not what the Russians are after. So they keep going back and forth,
*02:08.440- 02:11.740* :  don't have a problem as it's my life that's draining away.
*02:12.640- 02:17.340* :  And the eight-year-old girl who beat a chess master 30 years has seen you.
*02:21.260- 02:28.040* :  Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution bars anyone engaged in insurrection or rebellion
*02:28.040- 02:33.960* :  from holding office. The Colorado Supreme Court has ruled by a margin of four to three that that
*02:33.960- 02:38.480* :  rule should apply to Donald Trump over the storming of the US capital by his supporters.
*02:39.120- 02:44.540* :  And so it has disqualified him from the state's Republican primary next year. The format US
*02:44.540- 02:49.880* :  president has rejected the decision and the issue looks set to be decided by the US Supreme Court,
*02:50.400- 02:55.420* :  including three justices that he appointed. I asked our Washington correspondent Nomiya
*02:55.420- 03:00.280* :  Iqbal if the Colorado ruling could affect Donald Trump's chances of getting the Republican
*03:00.280- 03:07.780* :  nomination and ultimately becoming president again. Not really, because Colorado is a state that
*03:07.780- 03:14.800* :  Donald Trump doesn't need to win. It's gone democratic for many years now. He lost it in 2020. He
*03:14.800- 03:19.360* :  can afford to lose it again. But I think the bigger issue here is what if the decision is upheld
*03:20.100- 03:27.180* :  by the US Supreme Court? Other states that a Donald Trump does need to prevail in, does need to win.
*03:27.180- 03:31.940* :  Could I up this ruling and they could be inspired by it or emboldened by it even though they're not
*03:31.940- 03:37.340* :  legally bound by it? So that's the issue here. And we won't know which way it will go until the
*03:37.340- 03:44.520* :  US Supreme Court decides at some point. As of right now though, Donald Trump's name is still on
*03:44.520- 03:51.080* :  the ballot in Colorado that will remain as this goes through the court as the US Supreme Court
*03:51.080- 03:55.620* :  takes it on board. Yeah, it's just one of a number of cases regarding Donald Trump that the
*03:55.620- 04:01.560* :  Supreme Court has been asked to lurk at. I mean, is this illegal or is it a political issue and
*04:01.560- 04:06.280* :  what do voters think of it all? There are so many trials and issues that, you know,
*04:06.460- 04:10.640* :  next year, when you, when you, honestly, if I could show you our calendar in the newsroom,
*04:10.880- 04:14.740* :  we've got all the primary dates on there. Of course, we know that but so much of it is taken up by
*04:14.740- 04:21.580* :  trials and all the different dates that will have to to mark when that happens. In terms of
*04:21.580- 04:26.720* :  is it political legal, I think it's both definitely political. There are many lawsuits that have
*04:26.720- 04:31.840* :  been filed in about 12 states trying to get Donald Trump kicked off the ballot arguing he's unfit
*04:31.840- 04:35.860* :  because of what happened in January of the 6th. Remember, he's not gone on trial for that.
*04:35.860- 04:41.340* :  Less alone be convicted. All those lawsuits have been dismissed, but it's stuck in Colorado.
*04:42.320- 04:47.200* :  And if they do uphold the ruling, let's say there's a US Supreme Court decise, we're going to
*04:47.200- 04:51.700* :  uphold the ruling. It's going to be controversial because it means that the highest court in the
*04:51.700- 04:56.080* :  land has decided that Donald Trump did engage in an insurrection and shouldn't be president.
*04:56.100- 05:01.720* :  But here's the thing. If they rule against it, then voters and advocacy groups that don't want
*05:01.720- 05:05.920* :  Donald Trump to run will say, well, the Supreme Court, as you mentioned there, three of its
*05:05.920- 05:11.080* :  appointees are of Donald Trump's have got involved in the election that they've interfered.
*05:11.080- 05:15.500* :  So, it's just another really consequential moment that's going to play out as we head into
*05:15.500- 05:18.740* :  the election next year. An election that we already knew was hugely unpredictable.
*05:19.200- 05:24.360* :  Nomiya Ikbal in Washington. Officials in Gaza say more Palestinians have been
*05:24.360- 05:29.300* :  dying in fighting between Israel and Hamas with reports of multiple casualties from
*05:29.300- 05:33.440* :  a bombardment near a hospital in the city of Raffa near the Egyptian border.
*05:34.000- 05:39.380* :  However, political leaders on both sides are said to be working towards a possible new ceasefire
*05:39.380- 05:45.100* :  and hostage deal. The head of Hamas, Miss Malhania, has traveled from Qatar to Egypt for talks.
*05:45.140- 05:50.800* :  While the Israeli president on Tuesday spoke of being ready for another humanitarian pause.
*05:51.380- 05:57.400* :  An agreement in November saw Hamas release 80 Israeli hostages in return for 240 Palestinian
*05:57.400- 06:03.360* :  prisoners. Our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell, is in Jerusalem, so is another swap
*06:03.360- 06:09.180* :  deal moving closer. It does look like things are going in that direction. It will require
*06:09.180- 06:14.840* :  some change in the part of the public position of Hamas because up to now it is said that it will
*06:14.840- 06:21.140* :  only accept to release more of the 100 plus Israeli hostages its holding in exchange for
*06:21.140- 06:24.800* :  a permanent ceasefire. But it's being read very much that having
*06:24.800- 06:30.860* :  Miss Malhania, the head of Hamas in Cairo, Egypt of course, is a key mediator. He's meeting the
*06:30.860- 06:36.560* :  Egyptian intelligence chief who usually holds the guards of file. That is a sign of seriousness.
*06:36.560- 06:42.700* :  There are reports in the Israeli media about a bit more on the specifics of what is potentially
*06:42.700- 06:50.360* :  being discussed. They say that perhaps 30 to 40 hostages could be released over the course of a
*06:50.360- 06:56.280* :  week or two. These would be the remaining women hostages that are held as well as older men
*06:56.280- 07:04.440* :  and men who are sick or in need of urgent medical care. In exchange they accept, according to
*07:04.440- 07:10.340* :  these reports, that some Palestinians who are held in Israeli jails and convicted of serious
*07:10.340- 07:16.340* :  offenses against Israelis could be among those freed in exchange as well as of course another
*07:16.340- 07:21.420* :  increase in the amount of aid that's going into Gaza. Can you tell us what is known about what is
*07:21.420- 07:27.420* :  actually happening in Gaza at the moment? There's reports of a big aid convoy going in but also
*07:28.060- 07:33.660* :  these claims of an attack near the Kuwaiti hospital in Raffa. These claims are only just kind of
*07:33.660- 07:40.820* :  coming through in the last period of about the attack in Raffa. I've been speaking to people in
*07:40.820- 07:45.020* :  Han Unis in the last few hours and they've been telling me that the fierce fighting there,
*07:45.020- 07:49.660* :  this is the other southern city really at the heart of Israel's southern offensive. That
*07:49.660- 07:55.080* :  fighting has been going on all through the night. It's ongoing. One man who'd moved from his
*07:55.080- 07:59.560* :  neighbour to the Nussel hospital there for shelter said there had been violent shelling in clashes.
*07:59.580- 08:05.280* :  He said Israeli tanks were noticeably moving closer to the hospital and that is making
*08:05.280- 08:09.600* :  the route to the hospital very dangerous. We heard that from a doctor there as well and he was
*08:09.620- 08:15.540* :  saying just listing really the airstrikes had taken place since last night killing 15 members of
*08:15.540- 08:22.280* :  one family, 10 injured in another attack and then he talked about a number of other people who
*08:22.280- 08:27.240* :  had been killed from two other families in the west of the city and just how it was such
*08:27.240- 08:30.980* :  dire conditions in the hospital. He said patients had been dying when they'd tried to perform
*08:30.980- 08:35.520* :  surgeries because of the lack of medical supplies. There's very little anaesthetic. They've run
*08:35.520- 08:40.180* :  out of blood and because the phone communications are so poor sometimes they just want to summon
*08:40.180- 08:43.880* :  another doctor from a different part of the hospital and it's very difficult to do even that.
*08:44.460- 08:50.460* :  Yo Land, now in Jerusalem. Migration has been a contentious political issue across Europe ever
*08:50.460- 08:57.020* :  since the crisis of 2015 when a million people arrived in the EU. This year numbers are once again
*08:57.020- 09:03.980* :  on the rise with the border agency Frontex recording a 17% increase in what it calls irregular crossings
*09:03.980- 09:11.600* :  with more than 350,000 of them being recorded in the first 11 months of 2023. Today after years of
*09:11.600- 09:17.180* :  trying EU member states and the European Parliament finally agreed a new plan to tackle asylum
*09:17.180- 09:22.780* :  and migration. Here's the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metzola. We can really
*09:22.780- 09:29.280* :  be proud of Europe today. The agreement before the end of this year is a huge success
*09:30.200- 09:36.700* :  for the constructive pro-European centre ahead of an election year in Europe. We had promised it
*09:36.700- 09:43.720* :  to our citizens and now we are delivering. It all comes down to Europe taking the lead and we do
*09:43.720- 09:49.540* :  it our way. We do it responsibly by addressing topics that are important for our people.
*09:50.180- 09:55.240* :  The agreement was welcomed by frontline states like Greece and Italy, which said it no longer
*09:55.300- 10:01.020* :  felt alone. Hungary though rejected it in the strongest possible terms. Are your regional
*10:01.020- 10:07.360* :  editor Danny Abahad told us about the deal? It's a framework including a number of legislative packages
*10:07.360- 10:13.720* :  Oli. It concerns things like for example the screening of irregular arrivals at the external
*10:13.720- 10:19.500* :  borders of the EU to make sure it's standardized and the speeded up. This is both for things like
*10:19.500- 10:27.280* :  health checks but also for security identity checks. It provides for a biometric database so that
*10:27.280- 10:33.600* :  will stop the phenomenon of asylum shopping whereby multiple asylum claims are lodged in different
*10:33.600- 10:41.300* :  countries. It will try to speed up the processing of asylum claims. They're streamlining them for
*10:41.340- 10:49.180* :  example from countries where people generally don't get asylum. Most asylum claims are refused
*10:49.180- 10:55.200* :  those will be speeded up as will the returns of migrants deemed not eligible for refugee status
*10:55.620- 11:00.900* :  and there is a crucial element to this which is this solidarity mechanism. Frontline states have
*11:00.900- 11:05.940* :  long complained that under the current rules they have to deal with all of the migrants themselves
*11:05.940- 11:12.160* :  and they're not helped out by the other 27 member states. Now countries will have to either accept
*11:12.160- 11:17.620* :  quotas of migrants to relocate them or they would have to make financial or material contributions
*11:17.620- 11:23.920* :  to the states that do so that's a very important breakthrough. Yeah I mean will it be passed by
*11:23.920- 11:30.300* :  governments who have perhaps been reluctant to accept arrivals from other countries and end
*11:30.300- 11:35.640* :  those divisions between the north and south of Europe? Well the deal needs formal ratification
*11:35.640- 11:42.100* :  both by the European Parliament and by the European Council which represent all 27 member states
*11:42.460- 11:47.140* :  but on the basis of this agreement it will get that ratification next year and be implemented
*11:47.740- 11:53.460* :  so the options that these countries have they don't have to accept migrants they've been
*11:53.460- 11:58.500* :  disputes in places like Poland and Hungary where they say they don't want Muslim migrants for
*11:58.500- 12:05.620* :  example from countries like Syria so this has been diffused to an extent. It's still a controversial
*12:05.680- 12:11.380* :  deal several humanitarian charities have opposed it and say that it doesn't fully protect
*12:11.380- 12:16.480* :  the rights of those who arrive especially those who are returned in speedy processes but the
*12:16.480- 12:22.220* :  European Commission and others say that all migrant arrivals will now get free legal consultation
*12:22.220- 12:27.900* :  at the point of arrival which they say is an improved right and they say it's a fair deal
*12:27.900- 12:33.880* :  that it respects the EU's humanitarian values. Danny Abahad our Europe Regional Editor.
*12:34.840- 12:40.520* :  Poland's new pro-EU coalition government has fired the heads of the country's public broadcasters
*12:40.520- 12:45.360* :  as it moves to depoliticise the state media. The culture minister said new management
*12:45.360- 12:51.020* :  boards have been appointed for Polish TV, radio and the state news agency. Critics said that
*12:51.020- 12:57.340* :  the state run media in particular the 24 hour news channel TVP Info had become an outlet for
*12:57.340- 13:03.880* :  propaganda during the law and justice parties eight years in office. Their MPs now in opposition have
*13:03.880- 13:09.480* :  begun to sit in a protest at Polish TV's headquarters. Here's Adam Eastern in Warsaw.
*13:10.240- 13:14.720* :  The culture minister said the sackings were justified because the Polish parliament approved
*13:14.720- 13:21.140* :  on Tuesday a resolution calling for an independent state media. Under the law and justice government
*13:21.140- 13:27.620* :  Poland dropped nearly 40 places in the world press freedom index. In response to the dismissals
*13:27.620- 13:32.840* :  law and justice MPs said the government is illegally taking control of the public media
*13:33.260- 13:39.160* :  and trampling on democracy. They argue Polish TV must remain a conservative media voice
*13:39.160- 13:43.600* :  and a group of its MPs are holding a sitting protest at the broadcasters headquarters.
*13:44.200- 13:50.840* :  Adam Eastern in Warsaw. A former American marine jailed in Russia has told the BBC he feels betrayed
*13:50.840- 13:56.160* :  and abandoned by the US government. Paul Wielin, who also has Canadian, British and Irish
*13:56.160- 14:01.300* :  citizenship, was detained on espionage charges while on holiday in Moscow in 2018.
*14:01.300- 14:06.040* :  President Putin said last week that the Kremlin hoped to find a solution to the dispute
*14:06.420- 14:11.280* :  over detained American citizens, who include the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gerskiewicz.
*14:11.860- 14:15.900* :  Our Eastern Europe Correspondent Sarah Reinsford has been following their cases.
*14:20.440- 14:25.660* :  It is five years since I first saw Paul Wielin being led into a Moscow court by
*14:25.660- 14:29.320* :  armed guards in ballad clavus. How do you feel about this charge of spying?
*14:32.500- 14:39.240* :  All negotiations to free him have failed. So when we spoke from his remote Russian
*14:39.240- 14:45.180* :  labour camp, he told me he felt abandoned by his government.
*14:45.480- 14:50.480* :  It's a serious betrayal. Famous of them being broken and I can't believe that I'm told now.
*14:51.040- 14:54.600* :  I know that the US has come up with all sorts of proposals, serious proposals,
*14:55.360- 14:58.760* :  but it's not what the Russians are after. So they keep going back and forth.
*14:59.200- 15:04.100* :  The only problem is it's my wife that's draining a whiny while we do this.
*15:04.440- 15:09.800* :  The US State Department told me it has made multiple proposals for him to Moscow and that it's
*15:09.840- 15:14.900* :  working hard. But it seems like Russia is collecting hostages now.
*15:19.080- 15:25.460* :  Evan Gerskiewicz was detained in March accused of espionage for doing his job as a journalist.
*15:25.460- 15:31.360* :  Every so often the young American reporter appears for a custody hearing in a cage.
*15:32.300- 15:36.380* :  The Wall Street Journal and his government are clear that the charge is false.
*15:36.760- 15:40.960* :  Dear Evan, I didn't take my laptop with me to New York so I'm writing to you by hand this time.
*15:40.960- 15:46.040* :  Paulina writes to Evan every week. The two started out as reporters together in Moscow.
*15:46.560- 15:50.720* :  Now he's locked up and she has to cover Russia from abroad for safety.
*15:54.160- 15:58.620* :  Paulina and friends are collecting letters of support forever from all over the world.
*15:58.620- 16:01.760* :  Paulina says what's happening is terrifying.
*16:02.400- 16:05.440* :  Yeah, when it happens to your friend, it's just the universe collapses.
*16:06.100- 16:07.800* :  Evan is not a spy. Evan is a journalist.
*16:08.020- 16:11.920* :  All my greatest hope is that Evan is released as soon as possible and can go home,
*16:11.980- 16:14.320* :  can go back to work, can go back to his family.
*16:15.320- 16:16.740* :  What will it take to bring them home?
*16:16.740- 16:22.380* :  And do you think that Vladimir Putin was asked about the American prisoners last week at a press conference?
*16:25.800- 16:29.860* :  He found ignorance first. Then he said Moscow was open to their release.
*16:30.360- 16:32.760* :  So long as a deal was mutually acceptable.
*16:32.760- 16:38.280* :  But we think the only trade Moscow is demanding right now is for an FSB hitman,
*16:38.780- 16:43.480* :  convicted of murder in Germany. And that is deliberately difficult.
*16:43.480- 16:48.620* :  I mean, today it's what minus 15 out and there's no eat in the barracks.
*16:49.240- 16:51.920* :  Paul Willin has given up hoping for a quick release.
*16:52.540- 16:55.120* :  I am worried that there'll be a deal to leave me here.
*16:55.740- 16:59.320* :  With each case, my case is going to the back of the line.
*16:59.760- 17:00.840* :  It has been left in the dust.
*17:01.220- 17:03.140* :  It is Russia that caused this.
*17:03.520- 17:05.240* :  It's Russia that's playing tough.
*17:05.240- 17:08.880* :  But Paul Willin says his life has been ruined in prison.
*17:09.640- 17:12.900* :  And he wants America to push harder to get him out.
*17:13.620- 17:16.340* :  Now, Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford reporting.
*17:17.200- 17:22.200* :  Benobos and chimps have the longest long-term memories ever found in animals.
*17:22.260- 17:27.980* :  Researchers say the apes are capable of remembering those they've met even decades later.
*17:28.580- 17:32.480* :  The recognition appears to be influenced by how well they got on with each other.
*17:32.620- 17:38.060* :  Dr. Laura Lewis from the University of California, Berkeley told David Agupta more about her research.
*17:39.360- 17:44.520* :  We studied chimpanzees and Benobos their long-term social memory,
*17:44.520- 17:50.120* :  meaning their years-long memory for previous group mates that they had lived with,
*17:50.540- 17:53.620* :  that it either died or left the group some years ago.
*17:55.020- 18:01.160* :  So to briefly explain, we showed the chimps and Benobos in our study who lived in zoos around
*18:01.160- 18:05.300* :  the world. We showed them images on a computer screen side by side.
*18:05.560- 18:11.380* :  So one was an image of their former groupmate and next to an image of a complete stranger.
*18:12.220- 18:14.700* :  And using non-invasive eye-tracking technology,
*18:15.380- 18:21.300* :  we were able to tell that they looked longer significantly longer at the images of their
*18:21.300- 18:28.160* :  former groupmates as compared to the images of the strangers. So yeah, there were a few
*18:28.160- 18:34.860* :  kind of very memorable things about these results. One is just how long their memory lasts.
*18:34.860- 18:40.660* :  So in our main data set, we found that they remembered individuals or looked significantly
*18:40.660- 18:45.800* :  longer at individuals that they hadn't seen going back a decade. And then in our more full
*18:45.800- 18:53.220* :  data set, we even had one Benobo, Louise, who hadn't seen her sister, Loretta or her nephew,
*18:53.220- 18:59.840* :  Erin, for over 26 years. Because there were only a few trials from Louise, we couldn't fully
*18:59.840- 19:06.600* :  analyze them. But we also found much longer looking from Louise at the images of her sister.
*19:06.600- 19:09.940* :  And compared with human memory, then, is it coming close to it?
*19:10.060- 19:16.020* :  That's exactly right. Yes, it does actually rival our human memory. As humans, we can remember
*19:16.020- 19:24.320* :  others for at least 30 years, if not more like 48 years. And so this chimpanzee and Benobo memory
*19:24.320- 19:29.060* :  rivals that. It comes close to that 30-year memory. What's the significance of this research?
*19:29.060- 19:33.760* :  I think there's one more fascinating piece of this that I think helps, it definitely will help us
*19:33.860- 19:38.840* :  as humans, which is that we also found that it's social memories seem to shape their long-term
*19:39.620- 19:44.400* :  memory. So their social relationships with others, specifically their positive social
*19:44.940- 19:48.480* :  relationships. So we found that they looked longer at the images of their former friends.
*19:49.340- 19:55.240* :  And I think this helps us as humans to think about our own memory, how it's shaped by our social
*19:55.240- 20:01.900* :  relationships, right? And also to hopefully have more compassion for these animals and empathy.
*20:01.900- 20:08.520* :  And they are incredibly endangered, right? So their environments are being destroyed
*20:08.520- 20:15.900* :  and astronomical rates. And we now know that they likely remember events in which they are endangered.
*20:17.160- 20:20.000* :  Dr. Laura Lewis talking to Davina Gupta.
*20:22.300- 20:27.620* :  And still to come on the Global News podcast. Mr. Simpson, is it true that at one point your
*20:27.620- 20:34.720* :  sister-in-law was engaged to Troy McClure? To super fans of the Simpsons paid tribute by making their
*20:34.860- 20:35.720* :  own episode.
*20:44.100- 20:49.820* :  I'm Katya Adler and today on the global story I'll be taking a look at accusations of anti-semitism
*20:49.820- 20:55.600* :  on college campuses in the United States amidst growing protests against Israel's military action
*20:55.940- 21:01.220* :  in Gaza. The resulting congressional hearing has caused an uproar over free speech at US
*21:01.220- 21:06.900* :  universities. The global story brings you fresh insights and new perspectives from BBC experts
*21:06.900- 21:10.480* :  around the world. Find us wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*21:20.180- 21:25.140* :  Voting is underway in the Democratic Republic of Congo in an election marred by delays,
*21:25.140- 21:31.360* :  allegations of a lack of transparency and conflict in the East. President Felix Shisekadi is seeking
*21:31.360- 21:36.960* :  a second five-year term and his favourite to win against 18 challenges. Parliamentary,
*21:36.960- 21:42.800* :  provincial and municipal elections are also taking place with 100,000 candidates in the running.
*21:43.420- 21:47.740* :  But the campaign has been overshadowed by that fighting in eastern Congo, as I heard from our
*21:47.740- 21:52.700* :  correspondent Emory Makumano, who told me first about the problems at the polling stations today.
*21:53.440- 22:00.560* :  Yes, delays here in Kinshasa, the capital, where some people have just started voting after two or
*22:00.560- 22:08.280* :  three hours delay. This is particularly at a call, Riveron Kim, where voting started with the
*22:08.280- 22:16.000* :  delay of two hours. The same delay reports have also been heard from in eastern cities of
*22:16.000- 22:23.980* :  Goma, Bunea and also Numbasi, where voting also had some delays in town. But the electoral commission
*22:23.980- 22:30.740* :  said that they gave priority to the remote areas where two months ago they had started
*22:30.740- 22:36.760* :  deploying because of lack of infrastructure. So in the big cities, they were going to deploy
*22:36.760- 22:41.720* :  electoral material on the eve of the election and even including the voting days.
*22:42.040- 22:45.820* :  You mentioned voting in the East. How is that affected by the conflict?
*22:46.380- 22:53.860* :  Well, because of the conflict and particularly fresh fighting since October, 500,000 people have
*22:53.860- 23:00.280* :  been obliged to flee their homes. So those are the people who had registered but might not be voting
*23:00.320- 23:08.220* :  because they left their consistencies. But also, two consistencies in the Northkivo province,
*23:09.040- 23:15.400* :  where the government and the pro-government troops are fighting a rebel group called the M-23.
*23:15.860- 23:22.100* :  There are two consistencies, Masisi and Ruchuru, where even registration was impossible. So
*23:22.200- 23:29.960* :  there was no way for the electoral commission to deploy the electoral kits there. So it poses a
*23:29.960- 23:35.980* :  problem of inclusivity there, but because of the fighting, voting there was made impossible.
*23:36.420- 23:40.720* :  And looking at the presidential election, what are the main issues? Even the president
*23:40.720- 23:47.720* :  Shisekade himself says his record is mixed. Yes, the president Shisekade is one of his manifestos
*23:47.720- 23:55.600* :  was to restore peace in the Eastern conflict region, where currently we have seven million
*23:55.600- 24:03.600* :  internally displaced because of the ongoing flattening for the last two decades. But
*24:04.020- 24:10.140* :  well, as he is at the end of his first term, the fighting is still there, the displacement is
*24:10.140- 24:16.620* :  still happening. So this is something that he has not delivered, but also the rate of employment,
*24:16.620- 24:24.020* :  25 million food insecure. These are huge issues that during the first time he has not managed to solve
*24:24.020- 24:29.540* :  completely. Emory Makameno in Kinshasa. Staying in Africa and officials in Sudan,
*24:29.540- 24:34.780* :  a warning that the health system there is collapsing. An aid in the previous civilian governments
*24:34.780- 24:40.260* :  had the capture of the city of Wadmadanee by the paramilitary rapid support forces had disrupted
*24:40.260- 24:46.640* :  Sudan's vaccination program. Amjad Atayib told the BBC that millions of children would be affected.
*24:47.480- 24:53.700* :  The biggest catastrophe is the displacement of the supply chain of vaccines that was destroyed
*24:53.700- 25:00.320* :  by the militia in Khartoum. Now the occupation of Ahmed and Iwazara's F is risking the vaccination
*25:00.320- 25:06.160* :  of over two million children. And there is the age of one with the routine vaccine and over
*25:06.160- 25:14.360* :  15 million children who were blind to be vaccinated against measles in the coming few weeks.
*25:14.920- 25:20.100* :  Mr. Atayib also said the soldiers were not allowing the population to leave and they were in effect
*25:20.100- 25:26.180* :  being held hostage. Wadmadanee had been a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of people who
*25:26.180- 25:31.180* :  fled the fighting in the capital Khartoum. Hala Al-Kharibah, Sudanese women's rights activist
*25:31.180- 25:36.620* :  based in Uganda, told James Coppnell what she'd been hearing about conditions in Wadmadanee.
*25:37.420- 25:43.300* :  Very scary what I'm hearing from from Wadmadanee. It's exactly a recycling of what has happened
*25:43.300- 25:49.760* :  in West Dafor and what has happened in Niala and in Zalengi and earlier in April in Khartoum.
*25:50.420- 25:56.940* :  The RSF is taking over the cities. They are going door to door. There is reports of
*25:57.740- 26:04.280* :  looting of course, but what's more dangerous, there is reports of, you know, atrocities,
*26:04.280- 26:11.360* :  civilians, executions, and sexual violence. And, you know, we are still, you know, hearing,
*26:12.240- 26:21.360* :  you know, every day of new, not every day actually, every hour, you know, of new incidents of
*26:21.360- 26:28.640* :  atrocities. So it's extremely, extremely scary and worrying, you know, with the scale of the
*26:28.640- 26:34.700* :  conflict expanding. When you say atrocities, and I'm aware that some of the details will be
*26:34.800- 26:41.020* :  private, but also maybe very shocking to people, but could you perhaps give us an example or two
*26:41.020- 26:46.520* :  of things you've been hearing? And this is exactly what happened in Geneva and it happened in
*26:46.520- 26:55.200* :  Khartoum and other cities, you know, is initially when, when the RSF are entering the city, they
*26:55.200- 27:02.440* :  enter with the idea of conquering, you know, and the fact that everything is there. So people's
*27:02.440- 27:10.920* :  properties between men and girls, they've looked at us also, you know, properties. And so this
*27:10.920- 27:20.400* :  is the time when sexual violence occurs inside people's homes. So, so women are inside their homes
*27:21.460- 27:29.540* :  by the soldiers. And it's a, it's a non-tactic that the RSF or the Genjouites have been using for
*27:29.540- 27:36.760* :  very, very long time and it didn't change. It's an ongoing pattern. It's a, it's a war strategy
*27:36.760- 27:43.700* :  of terror and of, you know, domination. Hello, Al-Khari Basoudinese, women's rights activist
*27:43.700- 27:50.600* :  talking to James Coppnell. In 2021, the president of Haiti, Joe Vennel Moise, was assassinated,
*27:50.600- 27:55.900* :  plunging the Caribbean nation into chaos, ban worsening the violence and political instability.
*27:56.580- 28:02.500* :  Now, a court in the US has sentenced a former Haitian senator to life in prison for his role in
*28:02.500- 28:07.220* :  the affair. John Joel Joseph admitted helping to plan the murder. Will Grant reports.
*28:08.220- 28:12.680* :  The life sentence handed down to a former Haitian senator, John Joel Joseph,
*28:13.200- 28:19.040* :  shows just how high up the plot to murder President Jovenel Moise went. It is alleged that the
*28:19.040- 28:23.920* :  killing was carried out in President Moise's residence in Porto Prince by a group of Colombian
*28:23.920- 28:29.740* :  mercenaries. However, Mr. Joseph pleaded guilty to his part in the conspiracy and admitted to
*28:29.740- 28:35.000* :  taking part in planning the ambush. Specifically, he said he had attended meetings where President
*28:35.000- 28:40.420* :  Moise's assassination was discussed, including on the night before the murder. He also provided
*28:40.420- 28:45.000* :  material support for the group which allegedly carried out the shooting by providing them with
*28:45.000- 28:50.440* :  rental vehicles and attempting to obtain weapons for them. Former Senator Joseph now becomes
*28:50.440- 28:55.520* :  the third of 11 defendants to plead guilty over the murder, with former Colombian army officers
*28:55.520- 29:00.720* :  and foreign businessmen among those charged in the case. Since the murder, Haiti has been
*29:00.720- 29:05.960* :  plunged into many months of a political vacuum, with elections repeatedly stalled or cancelled
*29:05.960- 29:10.820* :  and a sharp rise in violence by powerful street gangs. Will Grant reporting.
*29:11.760- 29:16.780* :  Competitive chess with its need for sharp and creative mind has been called a young persons
*29:16.780- 29:21.780* :  game, but a rising star from London is testing the limits of exactly how young,
*29:21.780- 29:27.480* :  winning prizes at international tournaments at the age of just eight. Peter Goffin has the story.
*29:28.380- 29:34.420* :  Madonna Sivanodin found her calling at five years old, as the world was locking down during the
*29:34.420- 29:42.360* :  Covid pandemic. When one of my dad's friends was going back to India and Covid time and he gave
*29:42.360- 29:50.040* :  us a chess board, I was interested in the pieces and I started playing. Three years later,
*29:50.040- 29:56.200* :  she's been named the top female player at the European Championships for Blitz and Rapid Chess.
*29:56.660- 30:03.100* :  Time-limited matches that test a player's quick reactions. To win that title, she beat Lauren
*30:03.100- 30:09.780* :  DeCosta, the 39-year-old coach of England's national women's team. In the tournament's final round,
*30:09.780- 30:15.940* :  she played to a draw, with the 54-year-old Romanian grandmaster Vladislav Nevednitski.
*30:16.460- 30:22.740* :  I always try my best to win all the tournaments with all the games sometimes it happens and sometimes
*30:22.740- 30:30.400* :  it doesn't. I just play the board. Chess is no stranger to child prodigies. The legendary
*30:30.400- 30:37.000* :  American grandmaster Bobby Fisher won his first national championship at 14. The Indian player,
*30:37.000- 30:44.660* :  Ramesh Babu Pragananda, was ranked an international master at age 10. Two years ago, aged 16, he beat
*30:44.660- 30:51.640* :  World Champion Magnus Carlson. That's the path Madonna dreams of. Grandmaster status, gold medals,
*30:51.640- 30:58.720* :  and global titles. She's competed across Britain in Croatia, Egypt and beyond, with her dad Siva
*30:58.720- 31:03.860* :  in tow. She likes it and she likes traveling as well, so I keep taking her to tournaments,
*31:03.860- 31:10.620* :  like she said sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work well, but we keep trying and keep going.
*31:11.120- 31:16.320* :  The president of the English Chess Federation has called Madonna a phenomenon. Her playing style
*31:16.320- 31:23.640* :  remarkably mature, strategic, and patient. Chess may be contained to 64 squares on a board,
*31:23.700- 31:31.000* :  but for Madonna, the world is opening up before her. Peter Goffin. Finally, have a listen to this.
*31:31.420- 31:36.520* :  May I remind you that this is a court case, not open mic night at the comedy loft?
*31:36.800- 31:40.560* :  It's not! Oh, you like to be with him.
*31:40.740- 31:43.600* :  Hey, was the only way to get you to show up for Jerry Dooday?
*31:43.600- 31:47.480* :  Oh, whatever. As long as it's good material I can reuse later.
*31:47.960- 31:51.860* :  Now, if you find all the Simpsons, you might think that is from a new episode,
*31:51.860- 31:58.560* :  but it's actually the work of two super fans, American voice actor Jayden LeBron and New Zealand-based
*31:58.560- 32:03.980* :  animator Andrew Kemple. They've written, animated, and voiced a seven-minute pastiche of an early
*32:03.980- 32:09.000* :  Simpsons episode, which has even made its way to Simpsons showrunners and writers who've called it
*32:09.100- 32:11.960* :  amazing. The BBC's Will Chork has been talking to them.
*32:15.300- 32:20.400* :  Hi, I'm Andrew Kemple. I'm an animator, and I made a fan animation about the Simpsons recently.
*32:21.020- 32:24.440* :  Hi, I'm Jayden LeBron. I'm a voice actor from Southern California.
*32:25.100- 32:30.120* :  This is seven-minute slogging this video, and you play every single character.
*32:30.320- 32:36.840* :  Yeah, that I do. Mr. Simpson is a true that at one point your sister-in-law was engaged to
*32:36.840- 32:42.920* :  Troy McClure. Hey! How did you do me? We were both on the same Simpsons and main groups on
*32:42.920- 32:48.020* :  Facebook, and I think Jayden had seen a few of my memes, and I heard a few of his impressions,
*32:48.880- 32:56.660* :  his Romeo and Juliet for the modern age, you know, basically. The animation alone is incredible.
*32:56.660- 33:02.140* :  You do this for your job, right? But how much time did you put aside to dedicate to this hobby?
*33:02.580- 33:07.140* :  Well, usually in the evenings or weekends when I could find time after work, I'd do that,
*33:07.180- 33:13.560* :  and it took a lot longer than I thought. You've had an amazing response from Simpsons'
*33:13.780- 33:17.440* :  workers. You've sent this to writers and showrunners.
*33:17.440- 33:24.540* :  Yes, Al Jean, Mike Reece, recently sent it to Bill Oakley. One of the concerns that I've had
*33:25.120- 33:28.840* :  in the days leading up to it was whether or not they'd see this as a respectful
*33:28.840- 33:35.340* :  interpretation of the characters that they've all written for, and it's incredibly gratifying to
*33:35.340- 33:41.380* :  know that the characters sound good, that they were written well. Yeah, and especially because
*33:42.060- 33:47.020* :  my sense of humour as an animator comes a lot from the Simpsons that I was watching back when
*33:47.020- 33:51.740* :  I was little. So, you know, it's fun to sort of express how I've been influenced by them,
*33:51.740- 33:55.860* :  and they actually see it. That's quite surreal to hear about. Well, thank you guys very much for
*33:55.860- 34:02.380* :  your time, Jayden. I think it's going to go over to you to sign us off in any impressionistic way
*34:02.380- 34:09.820* :  you feel appropriate. Well, I'll say it well as I wish you a very, very sobriety and a happy
*34:09.820- 34:15.700* :  stupid flanders. Jayden Lebron and Andrew Kemple talking to Will Chalk.
*34:18.040- 34:22.040* :  And that is all from us for now, but the Global News podcast will be back very soon. This
*34:22.040- 34:26.560* :  edition was produced by Alice Adely and Mixed by Johnny Baker. Our editors, Karen Martin,
*34:26.700- 34:28.840* :  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
*34:36.200- 34:40.920* :  I'm Katya Adler, and today on the global story, I'll be taking a look at accusations of
*34:40.920- 34:46.920* :  anti-Semitism on college campuses in the United States amidst growing protests against Israel's
