00:37.700 - 00:41.660:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:44.740 - 00:49.760:  I'm Charlotte Gallagher and at 1300 hours GMT on Monday the 14th of August,
00:49.760 - 00:56.540:  these are our main stories. Cool leaders in Niger say they are preparing trees and charges against
00:56.540 - 01:02.460:  the deposed president, Mohammed Bazoum. The far-right politician, Javier Malay, has shocked
01:02.460 - 01:08.020:  Argentina by winning an election to select candidates for the presidential elections in October.
01:08.760 - 01:14.420:  The chief of staff to Madagascar's president has been arrested in London on charges of soliciting
01:14.420 - 01:23.460:  a bribe from a mining company. Also in this podcast, fed up with their government, the Israelis
01:23.460 - 01:30.780:  choosing to leave their home. And the teenage boy who survived falling from a ledge at the grand canyon.
01:31.240 - 01:36.680:  We're just like you were bringing a kid home in a car in front seat instead of in a box.
01:42.240 - 01:48.120:  Niger is still in turmoil following the military coup last month, which saw the democratically
01:48.120 - 01:53.900:  elected president, Mohammed Bazoum, ousted. Despite calls for him to be immediately released,
01:53.900 - 01:59.760:  he remains in detention. And now Niger's military leaders say they will prosecute him for high
01:59.760 - 02:05.800:  treason. It comes just hours after they said they remained open to diplomacy with the West African
02:05.800 - 02:11.880:  Regional Group ECOWASS to end the standoff over the coup. I heard more from the BBC's and
02:12.300 - 02:18.480:  who's been following events from neighbouring Nigeria. The statement read by Amis spokesperson
02:18.480 - 02:25.500:  last night did not explicitly say why they were going to prosecute him. However, we do believe that
02:25.500 - 02:32.860:  this is linked to Saturday statements from General Chiangni who said the coup was well intended
02:32.860 - 02:39.420:  and stating that they had struck to stave off an imminent threat that would have affected not
02:39.420 - 02:45.920:  only Niger, but also Nigeria. And although the statement did not say what that imminent threat was,
02:45.920 - 02:52.900:  what we do believe that these two were connected. Mohammed Bazoum so far as we know is being held
02:52.900 - 02:59.820:  in the basement of his house. Do we know how he is? Apart from international concerns raised
02:59.820 - 03:07.580:  by UN Secretary of State and ECOWASS and all other international buddies, we cannot categorically
03:07.580 - 03:14.100:  say what his state of health is. It was reported that he was denied access to medication, his
03:14.100 - 03:20.720:  physician and his food supplies were also limited as well. In fact, it was stated that he hadn't had
03:20.720 - 03:28.500:  human contact since last week Friday, but we do know that over the weekend his doctor paid him
03:28.500 - 03:35.020:  a visit. I think that was on late Friday, but we do not know what his current state of health is.
03:35.020 - 03:42.640:  We also know that his son and his wife who are with him as well, were also denied access to
03:43.120 - 03:47.640:  proper medical attention, so we can only imagine what they are going through.
03:48.520 - 03:52.320:  And what's the latest on diplomatic efforts? Has there been any progress?
03:53.280 - 04:00.920:  Well, today an ECOWASS delegation is expected to meet to push for more talks with the junta. So
04:01.380 - 04:06.500:  we are going to hear later in the day of a delegation. We do not know who would be in that
04:06.500 - 04:12.760:  delegation from ECOWASS to hold talks with the junta ever since they expressed their willingness
04:13.380 - 04:19.680:  to find a diplomatic and peaceful resolution to the political crisis in the country last Saturday.
04:19.680 - 04:26.500:  We also know that the Africa Union's Peace and Security Council is meeting today as well to
04:26.500 - 04:33.360:  discuss the situation in Niger, and this is a fallout from the willingness, of course,
04:33.360 - 04:39.640:  from the co-leaders who stayed now, they are ready to hold peace talks with anyone who is trying
04:39.640 - 04:45.540:  to resolve the crisis in the country, but we can only wait and see what these talks would hold
04:45.540 - 04:51.940:  later in the day. And Ketchie Ogbonner. Appeals are going out from Hawaiian volunteers helping
04:51.940 - 04:57.500:  communities recover from deadly wildfires. They say they need more help from the federal
04:57.500 - 05:03.680:  government in Washington. Locally organised relief efforts have intensified on the island of Maui,
05:03.680 - 05:08.460:  trying to supply food, water and shelter for survivors of the fire in Lahaina,
05:08.460 - 05:15.800:  Hawaiian's ancient capital, so far at least 93 people have been killed. Hawaii's governor said
05:15.800 - 05:24.700:  that figure is likely to rise. It is a harrowing sight in Maui. When those providers, the police
05:24.700 - 05:33.340:  and this division do come across scenes in houses or businesses, it is very difficult for them
05:33.340 - 05:37.420:  because they know ultimately that we are sharing with our people that there have been more fatalities.
05:37.420 - 05:42.420:  I do expect the numbers to rise. With the latest on the events on the island of Maui,
05:42.420 - 05:46.680:  Jason DeRose from National Public Radio has been speaking to Andrew Peach.
05:47.200 - 05:52.480:  I arrived on Maui on Thursday night, and as soon as I walked off the plane,
05:52.480 - 05:56.720:  what you saw were tourists who had been evacuated from resorts,
05:57.240 - 06:01.900:  sort of camped out around luggage claim, and there were just dozens and dozens of people
06:02.540 - 06:07.800:  sleeping at the airport. They had been evacuated from their resorts on the western side of the
06:07.800 - 06:14.200:  island that day or the day before, and they were waiting for their flights home. I also have
06:14.200 - 06:20.480:  visited an evacuation shelter at a high school where we saw 300 people are staying in the shelter,
06:20.480 - 06:27.480:  others are camped out around the shelter, I'm sleeping at cats in sleeping bags, kids, adults,
06:27.480 - 06:33.440:  whole families sometimes. I spent some time with a doctor who with a mobile van who
06:33.820 - 06:39.040:  drives around, doing essentially house calls, but now he's calling on people whose houses have
06:39.040 - 06:43.740:  been destroyed or who are staying in shelters and doing, you know, quick medical checkups.
06:44.280 - 06:49.000:  You've also been able to be pretty close to Lahaina, one of the towns that's been
06:49.000 - 06:57.640:  worst affected by this devastating fire. That's right. On Saturday, I took a tour boat along the
06:57.640 - 07:06.020:  coast of the island to Lahaina. It was actually full of supplies, water, diapers, ice, food,
07:06.020 - 07:12.960:  and the tour operators were ferrying this food up there because the only road into Lahaina keeps
07:12.960 - 07:18.360:  getting closed down, whether it's a traffic accident or because they're only allowing officials
07:18.360 - 07:24.140:  in or disaster relief people in, and these people on the beach, like invading suits, but it doesn't
07:24.140 - 07:29.660:  have to run out into the water, grab the cases of water or the diapers, and put this stuff into
07:29.660 - 07:34.480:  these pickup trucks that were just parked on the road along the beach, and then those pickup trucks
07:34.480 - 07:40.000:  would take off and take it to people who needed it, people who, you know, haven't had running water,
07:40.000 - 07:46.260:  people who haven't had electricity since Tuesday night when this fire broke out. I could see the
07:46.260 - 07:53.080:  charred remains of buildings, and in some places, the places where the buildings had been, dried out,
07:53.080 - 08:00.400:  charred trees. It was really devastating to see the winds blew the fire down the mountain
08:00.980 - 08:05.160:  toward the ocean, and that's where that real destruction happened, where many of those buildings
08:05.160 - 08:11.820:  that were along the ocean there in Lahaina. We're growing used to hearing these reports on the
08:11.820 - 08:17.920:  BBC World Service in recent days, but it's such a world away from the idyllic paradise we imagine
08:18.560 - 08:21.460:  when someone says Hawaii, at least for people who live elsewhere in the world.
08:22.740 - 08:28.720:  That's true, but here's what I've noticed in the past couple of days. Much of Maui is fairly
08:28.720 - 08:34.500:  unaffected. There are people at resorts, there are people walking around with pineapple cocktails,
08:34.500 - 08:42.260:  there are people enjoying the beach, so it's not as if all of Maui is destroyed, it's a fairly
08:42.260 - 08:49.400:  isolated section, but a historic section, a place where lots of tourists did go, it's a beautiful
08:49.480 - 08:56.160:  area, the water is amazingly blue, it's still beautiful, maybe if you just don't look at the
08:56.160 - 09:01.400:  charred areas of Lahaina. Most of the conversation is focusing on, obviously, what's happened,
09:01.400 - 09:06.820:  and the horror of what's happened and the relief operation that's underway. People are starting
09:06.820 - 09:13.300:  to talk about whether the island was sufficiently prepared. Yeah, the governor has ordered a comprehensive
09:13.300 - 09:20.580:  review of actions that were taken by officials before and during and after the fires,
09:20.580 - 09:26.620:  so clearly he wants to know what happened, was enough done, were the proper warnings given,
09:26.620 - 09:33.560:  was there enough access on the roads to get out? No matter how much warning you give, no one
09:33.560 - 09:38.380:  is ever prepared for a huge part of their town to be destroyed for their home to burn down.
09:39.220 - 09:45.720:  Jason DeRose speaking to Andrew Peach. Next, let's go to celebrations in the streets of Buenos Aires
09:46.040 - 09:46.720:  in Argentina.
09:53.500 - 09:59.180:  That's after the far right politician, Javier Malay, shocked his opponents by winning decisively
09:59.180 - 10:04.780:  in an election to select the candidates for presidential elections in October. Mr Malay is
10:04.780 - 10:11.240:  known for his regular TV appearances and famed for his voluminous hair and sideburns. He's also at
10:11.240 - 10:16.820:  admirer of the former U.S. president, Donald Trump. He pushed the conservative block into second place.
10:21.260 - 10:26.300:  Today, we are the force with most votes because we are the true opposition. We are the only ones
10:26.300 - 10:31.640:  who want a real change because remember, a different Argentina is impossible with the same old
10:31.640 - 10:36.540:  people, the same old people who've always failed, the same old people who've been failing for
10:36.540 - 10:44.480:  100 years. Matthias C. Bell is from BBC Monday. He started as a journalist, as an economic journalist,
10:44.480 - 10:52.680:  with extreme ideas and this colorful style and because TV loves this kind of character,
10:52.680 - 10:59.980:  he became really, really popular. So he decided to jump from the TV to politics and this extreme
10:59.980 - 11:06.700:  ideas in a country with 100% of inflation annually, started to draw attention and now we have this
11:06.700 - 11:14.300:  result. And you're Argentinian. What do you think is his appeal? Is it that he's something completely new?
11:15.020 - 11:22.880:  I think he has several appeals. One is he's an outsider and he says that the cast he called the
11:22.940 - 11:28.480:  old politicians has ruined the country, the economic situation in Argentina is so, so serious at
11:28.480 - 11:33.500:  the moment. But at the same time, we have a really toxic relationship with the American dollar.
11:34.620 - 11:41.760:  The generation who vote for me has been suffering a huge level of inflation and a local currency
11:41.760 - 11:47.880:  losing value every day. So the American dollar is like the only place that you can trust. The only
11:47.880 - 11:53.700:  thing where you can be safe and he's proposing a dollarization of the economy. He wants the American
11:53.700 - 11:59.720:  dollar to be the local currency of Argentina. And that idea, even if it's difficult or impossible,
11:59.720 - 12:04.880:  is really, really attractive. And I was just looking at his Instagram before we came on out and I
12:04.880 - 12:10.600:  saw that he's making a lot of the fact that the former president of Brazil, Bolsonaro, is supporting
12:10.600 - 12:18.300:  him. Yes, absolutely. He's like an Argentinian Bolsonaro with our own local Argentinian field. But
12:18.300 - 12:25.460:  at the same time, he's dangerous. We have to recognize that some of his ideas is like bomb the central
12:25.460 - 12:30.900:  bank of Argentina because he says we have to close the central bank because he's useless. So it's
12:30.900 - 12:36.320:  like it's not just colorful. Some ideas are really extreme. Matthias Sebel from BBC Mundo.
12:36.800 - 12:41.780:  Atop A to Madagascar's president has been arrested in London on corruption charges.
12:41.780 - 12:45.220:  I found out more from our Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton.
12:45.780 - 12:50.380:  The chief of staff to the president of Madagascar, he's called Romy Andriana Sue,
12:51.060 - 12:57.660:  and his French associate, Philip Tabato, they were in the office of a British mining company called
12:57.660 - 13:03.200:  Gemfields in London. And they're alleged to have asked for a bribe in order to facilitate,
13:03.200 - 13:11.140:  in order for the company to have licenses to mine on Madagascar. And it's alleged that they
13:11.140 - 13:16.880:  asked for a bribe of a quarter of a million dollars. Now we don't know any more details and they've
13:16.880 - 13:22.420:  just been charged on Saturday. They're doing court again in September. But we think there may have
13:22.420 - 13:27.360:  been some sort of sting operation because the national crime agency seemed to have arrested them
13:27.580 - 13:32.480:  in this office. So they must have perhaps been aware that they were going to be asked for a bribe.
13:32.900 - 13:36.640:  You said this was about mining, which is a huge industry in Madagascar.
13:36.900 - 13:42.080:  That's right. There's large-scale mining for minerals like titanium and gold and silver
13:42.420 - 13:48.480:  by multinationals like Rio Tinto. Then there's also a small-scale mining or artisanal
13:48.480 - 13:53.720:  mining. And I went to a place in the south of Madagascar many years ago called Ilacaca,
13:54.100 - 13:59.220:  which is very bizarre. It's basically one street. It's in the south of the island. And then alongside
13:59.220 - 14:05.080:  the street, there are these little stalls. And inside you get these men from South Asia examining
14:05.080 - 14:10.820:  through microscopes, rubies and sapphires and emeralds and saying how much do you want for them.
14:10.860 - 14:16.220:  And it's really weird because it's in the middle of nowhere and it takes about two days on a bus
14:16.220 - 14:23.260:  to get there. And it's alleged that children have been used to go down mine shafts for illegal mining.
14:23.260 - 14:28.540:  As you say, it's a big industry. It attracts a lot of investment. And actually in the middle of
14:28.540 - 14:34.320:  nowhere you'd meet someone for a beer and he'd have an American accent and he'd have a four-by-four
14:34.320 - 14:38.800:  and you'd say, what do you do here? And they go, oh, I'm into rocks, you know, precious stones.
14:39.500 - 14:45.200:  And how bad is corruption in Madagascar? Again, I was there quite a long time ago, but at the time
14:45.200 - 14:50.720:  personally, when I, when I first arrived, I got to the airport, I got my laptop in pounded.
14:51.180 - 14:55.840:  It took about two hours to get it back from the authorities. They kept asking for various
14:55.840 - 15:01.800:  bureaucratic forms. And then when I was talking about it to a friend, you know, like days later,
15:01.800 - 15:06.960:  he said they were asking for a bribe. So it's pretty much endemic and it's been a problem
15:06.960 - 15:13.160:  on on a national scale for decades. Richard Hamilton. Since early this year, hundreds of
15:13.160 - 15:18.480:  thousands of Israelis have joined unprecedented mass rallies against the country's right-wing
15:18.480 - 15:23.980:  government and its controversial plans to overhaul the justice system. Now there are signs that
15:23.980 - 15:30.140:  more secular Israelis are considering leaving the country. Now, increasingly, they make up a minority
15:30.140 - 15:34.920:  in Israel because of the higher birth rate among religious Jews. Our Middle East correspondent,
15:34.920 - 15:45.780:  Yolan Nell reports. Right here in the heart of Tel Aviv, more than 30 weeks now into Israel's
15:45.780 - 15:51.160:  anti-government protests. There's no sign they're letting up. I'm looking across at a huge crowd,
15:51.960 - 15:57.960:  but there are some protesters I've met who are planning a radical step leaving the country.
15:58.660 - 16:04.860:  I'm going to London for a sabbatical and this will be my laboratory to see if I can live outside
16:04.860 - 16:11.440:  Israel. After six months joining these demonstrations with his wife, children, sister, and hundreds
16:11.440 - 16:17.360:  of thousands of others, top Israeli radiologist Professor Ken Hoffman will soon head to a hospital
16:17.360 - 16:23.720:  in the UK. He says he may stay away. He believes the country is backsliding on democracy.
16:24.040 - 16:28.720:  We are losing our country. This is what we feel. In the long term, if the situation will be so bad
16:28.720 - 16:34.120:  and it's, it's wasn't in every day, we will find a place to live outside Israel. We all have
16:34.940 - 16:43.240:  European passports. Protesters are furious at legislation to limit the power of the Supreme Court.
16:43.260 - 16:49.160:  The hardline government says it's correcting a system where elected politicians are too easily
16:49.160 - 16:56.020:  overruled. One recent poll suggested a third of Israelis were now weighing up a move. I ask
16:56.020 - 17:00.940:  other protesters here what they think. But there are a lot of people that are looking to diversify
17:00.940 - 17:06.460:  and have a plan being placed. Plan B is the buzzword now, right? It would be hard, Rachel.
17:07.700 - 17:12.620:  But I will not raise my kids in a country which is not democratic. What do we want?
17:12.620 - 17:15.860:  Where do we want it?
17:16.100 - 17:21.620:  These demonstrations are opening up deep social divisions in Israel. The current coalition
17:21.620 - 17:27.640:  government relies on ultra-orthodox Jews and religious nationalists who represent fast-growing
17:27.640 - 17:34.580:  socially conservative parts of the population. Increasingly, as secular Israelis become a minority
17:34.580 - 17:40.520:  in the country, they see a threat to their liberal lifestyles. Professor Alan Tal is head of the
17:40.520 - 17:45.820:  public policy department at Tel Aviv University. It's not clear how many Israelis will actually
17:45.820 - 17:52.580:  carry out their threats to leave, but he warns that an exodus could have a big impact on key sectors
17:52.580 - 18:00.140:  such as high tech, medicine and academia. When the truly talented people who carry on their
18:00.140 - 18:06.500:  shoulders, the innovation and the economic development that this country is so dependent on,
18:06.820 - 18:10.320:  when they decide they've had enough and they don't want to live in a country that no longer
18:10.320 - 18:14.580:  represents them, then we could see a collapse, an economic collapse.
18:20.100 - 18:25.780:  Back at the weekly protests in Tel Aviv, the national anthem plays out. The demonstrators see
18:25.780 - 18:32.080:  themselves as patriots. Many have served in Israel's conscript military and spent years more in reserves.
18:32.860 - 18:38.720:  And some, like one young woman I meet or need, swear that whatever happens, they'll never move away.
18:50.040 - 18:56.000:  For the crowd here, for now, the fight is continuing at full volume to try to force the government
18:56.000 - 19:02.820:  to change track on its judicial overhaul. But at the same time, another challenge is quietly building
19:02.820 - 19:06.860:  up, with more Israelis drafting their exit plans.
19:09.600 - 19:18.900:  Yo Lan now in Israel. Still to come, more than 13 news organisations in the US have signed an
19:18.940 - 19:23.460:  open letter condemning a police raid on a local newspaper in Kansas.
19:23.940 - 19:29.200:  It's unique to have a search warrant executed on a newspaper, on a news organisation in the
19:29.220 - 19:34.940:  state, because it was just totally off the radar that this sort of search and seizure would be
19:35.020 - 19:37.080:  possible that a search warrant would actually be executed.
19:43.780 - 19:48.080:  Wow, what an experience to be a part of the Tokyo Olympics. It's so interesting in my memory.
19:48.300 - 19:50.260:  It's one of the pinnacles of my athletic career.
19:50.580 - 19:55.820:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympic and Paralympic athletes share their remarkable stories
19:55.820 - 20:01.400:  from the struggles. Lots of sacrifices, lots of hard work, tears, a lot of things that the outside
20:01.400 - 20:11.260:  world doesn't know. To the victories. On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you
20:11.260 - 20:20.000:  get your BBC podcasts. At least 30 people are reported missing after a mudslide struck
20:20.000 - 20:25.980:  miners digging for Jade in northern Myanmar. The incident occurred in a remote mountainous region
20:25.980 - 20:32.020:  of Kachin State, here's Jonathan Head. Survivors have described a wall of mud rocks and flood water
20:32.020 - 20:38.240:  overwhelming them as they were digging for Jade, sweeping many of the miners away. Several people
20:38.240 - 20:43.860:  are being treated for injuries and rescue teams are looking for the missing. The landscape in this
20:43.860 - 20:50.080:  part of Myanmar is scarred with hundreds of unregulated mines. These attract huge numbers of migrant
20:50.080 - 20:55.260:  workers from other parts of Myanmar who come to search for Jade, most of which ends up being
20:55.260 - 21:01.200:  sold in China. Landslides are a constant threat, particularly at this time of the year when Myanmar
21:02.040 - 21:08.560:  experiences heavy monsoon rain. Around 170 people died in the landslide in the same area three years
21:08.860 - 21:15.480:  to go. Jonathan Head. More than 13 news organisations in the US, including the New York Times and
21:15.480 - 21:20.840:  the Washington Post, have signed an open letter condemning a police raid on a local newspaper
21:20.840 - 21:26.580:  the Marion County Record in Kansas. It's been claimed the search breached the first
21:26.580 - 21:32.480:  amendment of the constitution which guarantees a free press. Max Kouch is an attorney with the
21:32.480 - 21:38.300:  Kansas Press Association. It's unique to have a search warrant executed on a newspaper on
21:38.300 - 21:44.380:  a news organisation in the state because it was just totally off the radar that this sort of search
21:44.380 - 21:48.900:  and seizure would be possible that a search warrant would actually be executed. It's been reported
21:48.900 - 21:54.720:  a judge authorised the warrant which said there was probable cause to believe identity theft and
21:54.720 - 22:00.540:  unlawful acts concerning computers had been committed. As well as the raid at the newspaper's
22:00.540 - 22:07.520:  office on Friday, the home of its co-owner, 98-year-old Joan Meyer, was also searched. She died the
22:07.520 - 22:12.720:  next day and the Marion County Record suggested the raid was to blame after it left her stressed
22:12.720 - 22:18.160:  beyond her limits. Her son, Eric, claimed the police were investigating the newspaper because of
22:18.160 - 22:23.480:  confidential information. It had received about a restaurant owner, a Washington Correspondent Sean
22:23.480 - 22:30.000:  Dilly, spoke to my colleague, Alex Ritson. The target very much of Friday's raid was not only
22:30.000 - 22:36.220:  her home but the offices of the newspaper. Her son is called Eric. They were together the co-owners
22:36.220 - 22:42.580:  of a newspaper called the Marion County Record. So on Friday, around 11am, local law enforcement,
22:42.580 - 22:48.100:  according to the newspaper, that would be all five local police officers and two sheriff deputies
22:48.100 - 22:53.280:  turned up, saying that they had a search warrant which they produced for misuse of computers and
22:53.280 - 22:57.880:  identity theft. Now, the law enforcement side of things is, well, we're allowed to do this when
22:58.320 - 23:02.800:  there's a suggestion that journalists themselves are the centre of criminal allegations but
23:02.800 - 23:08.320:  clearly journalistic material itself is protected. So there have been local concerns not just from
23:08.320 - 23:12.600:  the newspaper but other journalists about what is essentially a concerning way to gather material
23:12.600 - 23:18.020:  which normally should be gathered by subpoena. There are claims that the reason for the police
23:18.020 - 23:23.780:  raid was because the newspaper was investigating a restaurant owner who'd been convicted of drunk
23:23.780 - 23:29.520:  driving but continued using her car without a license. Now, on how on earth can that have gone from
23:29.520 - 23:34.420:  being a newspaper investigation into a raid by the police sanctioned by a judge on a newspaper?
23:34.820 - 23:38.940:  Well, you know, you would hope that there's more information than is publicly available but here's
23:38.940 - 23:44.540:  how it played out according to the son Eric. He said that the newspaper was approached after
23:45.060 - 23:49.320:  Newall had kicked reporters out of a meeting with a local politician. The politicians' representatives
23:49.320 - 23:55.240:  very apologetic about this afterwards. A newspaper claimed that they had an approach from somebody
23:55.240 - 24:00.000:  giving them information about the criminal conviction. The reason they say that this became
24:00.000 - 24:06.440:  particularly relevant is it could have prevented her having an alcohol license for her restaurant but
24:06.440 - 24:11.040:  the newspaper doubting that source they say informed the police they said, look, we've been
24:11.040 - 24:16.840:  approached with this confidential information that's been leaked to us. Newall is then said to have
24:16.840 - 24:22.320:  reported to the local council that her information had been gathered unlawfully and now you've got
24:22.320 - 24:28.100:  quite an extraordinary claim here by law enforcement that computers have been misused by journalists
24:28.920 - 24:34.300:  and that they've misused them in pursuant of identity theft. Now, you know, clearly they're better
24:34.300 - 24:39.320:  had been evidence to support this in due course because otherwise there are incredibly large
24:39.320 - 24:45.300:  questions looming about the First Amendment, the right to a free press and essentially the idea
24:45.300 - 24:50.600:  that police officers would raid journalists' offices essentially for information about sources.
24:50.600 - 24:54.560:  Now, law enforcement say that's not what they're doing. They're investigating they claim criminal
24:54.560 - 25:01.160:  activities by journalists. Sean Dilly speaking to Alex Ritzon. Now, have you ever pretended to be
25:01.160 - 25:07.560:  busy at work to impress your manager or colleagues? A new survey of workers in nine countries by the
25:07.560 - 25:13.580:  messaging platform Slack has found that people spend more time on performative work that's focusing
25:13.580 - 25:19.620:  on appearing busy than doing actual real work. Our Asia Business Reporter Katie Silver told us more.
25:20.180 - 25:24.440:  What they did is they looked at the data of about 18,000 workers both in terms of how they were
25:24.440 - 25:30.080:  using Slack and surveyed them and they used this up to the executive level. They looked at all types
25:30.080 - 25:34.740:  of workers. They've used this data with a research firm and they were looking at performative work
25:35.060 - 25:39.240:  and that is whether or not for example meetings are used to present achievements which is seen as
25:39.240 - 25:44.080:  something performative or whether they were used to make decisions or address issues. Now,
25:44.580 - 25:49.160:  as you mentioned, India, Japan, they were the worst performers as well as Singapore which came
25:49.160 - 25:54.140:  in at number three. The UK where you are, it was better than the global average. It scored about
25:54.140 - 25:59.460:  30%, the global average was about 32%, and the best countries were the US and South Korea.
26:00.100 - 26:05.900:  Now, if you ask the all-important question why, it actually comes down to employers rather than
26:05.900 - 26:11.040:  employees and really how they measure productivity. That's according to Slack. So they say, for example,
26:11.040 - 26:16.760:  it's whether or not employers measure productivity as activity. That is, for example, how many emails
26:16.760 - 26:21.740:  are sent or how many meetings are attended or outcomes. And the problem here is it means that for
26:21.740 - 26:26.900:  many employees, it can be a huge amount of wasted effort. And the reason really that employers
26:26.900 - 26:32.160:  are perhaps looking at this is that the easier, more measurable things to measure. Now, Singapore was
26:32.160 - 26:37.040:  the worst when it came to this. Almost half of the respondents felt that their work was impacted by
26:37.040 - 26:42.480:  spending too much time on the likes of meetings and emails. And to give you an idea here in Singapore,
26:42.960 - 26:47.320:  the average or standard working week of a national company rather than a multinational company
26:47.320 - 26:53.620:  is about 44 hours a week rather than in the UK, 40 hours a week, with the idea really that you work
26:53.620 - 26:58.800:  a half day on Saturday. So that was something that was perhaps contributing to the idea of
26:58.800 - 27:05.200:  presentism and attending work and emails and showing your face. The other thing that employees
27:05.200 - 27:09.860:  as well complained about in the survey was concept of having to keep their statuses online.
27:09.860 - 27:15.100:  Employees really wishing that their value could be measured somewhat differently. Katie Silver.
27:16.340 - 27:22.200:  Now, to a dramatic story, an American teenager is recovering in a hospital after he fell almost
27:22.200 - 27:28.740:  13 metres down the Grand Canyon. 14-year-old Wyatt Kaufman is expected to make a full recovery
27:28.740 - 27:36.440:  despite extensive injuries. Alice Adley reports. The spectacular natural scenery of the Grand Canyon
27:36.440 - 27:43.940:  in Arizona is a draw for up to five million tourists every year. Most approach from the southern
27:43.940 - 27:51.300:  edge, but Wyatt Kaufman and his mother were at the much less crowded North Rim. Here the narrow paved
27:51.300 - 27:57.420:  path provides incredible views, although it drops off on both sides in some places.
27:58.120 - 28:04.000:  Wyatt was with his mother at bright angel point and describes how he was dodging out of the way
28:04.000 - 28:09.880:  to keep out of other tourist pictures when he lost grip of the rock he was holding. He spoke
28:09.880 - 28:15.360:  to local TV station 12 news Arizona. I was moving out of the way for people to take a picture.
28:15.560 - 28:19.860:  I was squatting down and hanging onto it. I only had one hand on it so it wasn't that good
28:20.280 - 28:25.780:  of grip and it was kind of pushing me back and I lost my grip and I started to fall back.
28:26.140 - 28:32.420:  A two hour rescue ensued involving around 40 emergency workers. The boy had to be taken out of
28:32.420 - 28:38.960:  the canyon in a basket stretcher as a helicopter was unable to land due to high winds. He was then
28:38.960 - 28:45.220:  airlifted to a pediatric trauma center in Las Vegas. Wyatt suffered injuries to his spine,
28:45.220 - 28:53.460:  spleen and lung, but Matthew Crap from the Grand Canyon National Park told ABC he was lucky to be alive.
28:54.180 - 28:59.380:  Witnesses described seeing him slip from an elevated point out at the end of our
28:59.380 - 29:03.920:  bright angel point. He was at risk of falling further into the canyon that he was in such a
29:04.420 - 29:10.040:  good condition as he was given the distance he fell. It's not uncommon for people to fall
29:10.040 - 29:16.540:  in equivalent distance and be either unconscious and unable to respond or deceased.
29:17.420 - 29:24.040:  Wyatt's father Brian was at home in North Dakota when he got the call every parent dreads.
29:24.220 - 29:30.500:  Two hours is an eternity in a situation like that but when they have to repel down the cliff and
29:30.500 - 29:36.420:  get him out of the canyon in a basket it was one of the most heart-wrenching phone calls I've ever had.
29:36.600 - 29:41.920:  We're just lucky we're bringing our kid home in a car in front seat instead of in a box.
29:42.880 - 29:48.660:  Brian Kaufman ending that report by Alice Adely and finally to a new insight into the early days
29:48.660 - 29:53.880:  of the Beatles. Letters written by George Harrison's mother about to be auctioned have revealed
29:53.880 - 30:00.260:  what she thought of Beatles Mania. In one Louise Harrison writes of being disgusted and ashamed of
30:00.260 - 30:06.020:  being female after witnessing fans screaming at a concert. Stephen Bailey is the manager of the
30:06.020 - 30:10.880:  Beatles shop in Liverpool and is organising the auction. He told my colleague Michelle Hussain the
30:10.880 - 30:17.220:  series of letters was written to one fan Janet Gray over several years. It goes from 1963 to
30:17.220 - 30:24.560:  66 and it literally it tells a story of the beginning of the Beatles where she's got 30 letters
30:24.560 - 30:30.900:  for and feels sort of like oh gosh that's a lot of letters to 66 where she's got 3,000 letters
30:30.900 - 30:37.540:  to answer. So these are letters from fans? These are letters from fans. George's mom was a
30:37.540 - 30:43.080:  prolific writer, a wonderful person. She answered many probably thousands of letters.
30:43.840 - 30:50.240:  He would just written to George. And what did she think of them? I think she loved doing it.
30:50.240 - 30:55.960:  She was obviously very proud of George and she corresponded with these fans for many years so
30:55.960 - 31:01.220:  she obviously got something out of it. In one letter she's she's obviously gone to a concert
31:01.220 - 31:07.320:  and it's just sat there and totally bemused by the fact that girls have paid money to stand on seat
31:07.320 - 31:15.560:  and scream and she can't understand that. Let's face it what Mother Ward generally speaking she's
31:15.820 - 31:21.580:  the letters she's very proud of George and what he's done but also I think the letters show sort of
31:22.000 - 31:26.820:  a mother losing her son because right at the start George is obviously visiting home a lot
31:27.640 - 31:34.580:  and towards the end she goes oh we've seen George once this week you know that that's kind of it so
31:35.040 - 31:39.960:  yeah. It's a funny thing to do in a way to open fan letters that originally came for your for
31:39.960 - 31:46.020:  your child and then and then continue with correspondence. Well I this is it I don't think you know
31:46.020 - 31:50.300:  you start off writing to George, George's mum responds and then you start writing to George's
31:50.300 - 31:54.660:  mum basically. I guess in a way she's what she's sort of managing the beginnings of a fan club.
31:55.540 - 32:03.820:  It's sort of yes I mean but it's her kind of own personal fan club sort of thing I say the
32:03.820 - 32:08.680:  letters are very fascinating. That was Stephen Bailey talking to Michelle Hussain.
32:11.700 - 32:16.120:  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later
