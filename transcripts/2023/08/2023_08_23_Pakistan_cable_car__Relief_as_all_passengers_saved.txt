00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.800:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:19.420 - 00:25.600:  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Wednesday the 23rd August, these are our main stories.
00:26.080 - 00:31.540:  A dramatic rescue in Pakistan after children were left dangling above a ravine in a cable car.
00:31.540 - 00:36.020:  The BRICS economic group, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa,
00:36.020 - 00:41.860:  consider adding new members to their block. The child bodies of 18 people have been found by
00:41.860 - 00:50.860:  firefighters in Northeastern Greece. Also in this podcast, I know of people that have
00:51.180 - 00:58.040:  roped down and you know, and simply cried out of frustration and grief.
00:58.460 - 01:04.440:  How the out-of-control wildfires in Canada have left long-standing indigenous communities with
01:04.440 - 01:05.360:  nowhere to live.
01:15.300 - 01:20.380:  A helicopter shopping through the air high above Pakistan's mountainous northern
01:20.380 - 01:25.200:  region where a terrifying hanging by a thread drama has been playing out.
01:25.600 - 01:30.800:  Cable cars or chair lifts are commonly used to carry passengers across valleys and ravines
01:31.220 - 01:38.160:  in Kaiba-Pak-Tunquah province. But earlier on Monday, one of those lifts transporting six children
01:38.620 - 01:44.860:  and two adults became perilously stranded hundreds of meters above the ground when two wires snapped.
01:44.860 - 01:50.420:  After several anxious hours, all on board were finally rescued either by military helicopter
01:50.420 - 01:55.120:  or by local people working by floodlight on the ground using zip wires.
02:02.540 - 02:07.700:  My colleague Julian Marshall spoke to the BBC's Sahab Baloch in Islamabad.
02:07.880 - 02:13.300:  So the day began with the news that around eight people are stranded in a cable car in the middle
02:13.300 - 02:18.080:  of the air and what happened was that local media started to report on it and then it began to
02:18.080 - 02:23.640:  also uncover that there are children on board like there were six children and two adults and
02:23.640 - 02:28.740:  since a lot of like an rescue operation started the military got in and because you know,
02:28.740 - 02:33.060:  there were no other way of rescuing these children. So a military was called in and since then
02:33.060 - 02:38.640:  everybody was glued to their screens and watching how it was like this rescue operation going on.
02:38.640 - 02:43.380:  There was also a sling operation in which a man from the SSG force of the military was coming
02:43.380 - 02:48.520:  down from the helicopter and he made four different attempts of taking these children out of this
02:48.520 - 02:53.700:  stranded cable car. But for some reason, he was not able to and on the fourth attempt, he was able
02:53.700 - 02:58.400:  to rescue two children and there was of course a lot of people who were around that area also.
02:58.400 - 03:02.520:  They were parents who were in the crowd as well and they were cheering at that one of time but
03:02.520 - 03:06.940:  they were also holding on to you know, this fear that you know, what if you know, it all goes wrong
03:06.940 - 03:13.180:  and everything. So because the army helicopter during the day was also at an angle where it was
03:13.180 - 03:19.280:  also providing a lot of air and there was a there was anyway a strong windy day but the army helicopter
03:19.280 - 03:24.980:  was also sort of adding to it which was hindering the rescue operation. So at one point local rescue
03:24.980 - 03:29.560:  operation teams were also called in because it was getting dark and that's when we saw how
03:29.560 - 03:37.580:  local rescue teams also got into it. And how did those local rescue teams rescue the remaining
03:37.580 - 03:43.580:  six people in the cable car? Well what they did was they created a parallel zip line and then
03:43.580 - 03:48.420:  they rescued people and you know, this is something that is very familiar to a lot of people who
03:48.420 - 03:52.960:  live in the northern region of Pakistan. They know how to sort of survive and they are very self-sufficient
03:52.960 - 03:58.260:  in all of this and this is clearly not the first time that a cable car has been suspended in
03:58.300 - 04:02.900:  midair. So they were very much willing to help and you know, this was this was an idea which was
04:02.900 - 04:07.520:  suggested by a local rescue team member and everybody acted on it because it was already dark
04:07.920 - 04:12.760:  and everybody knew that they have already spent 14 hours trying to sort of rescue children and all
04:12.760 - 04:18.060:  and they were there was also one kid who had a heart condition as well. So they got onto it and
04:18.060 - 04:23.460:  made sure that the zip line works. Try to explain to me because I don't quite understand. You had
04:23.460 - 04:33.460:  one cable car that was dangling on one line because two wires had broken and there was a parallel
04:33.660 - 04:39.420:  wire was there to where the cable car was? Yes it was parallel to it like right next to it there
04:39.420 - 04:44.680:  was another one which was built by the by the locals as well. It was also a rope which was used
04:44.680 - 04:48.740:  but it was a stronger one. It was a stronger cable basically I should say which was also built
04:49.120 - 04:54.620:  and basically what they did was that locally they made sure that the children were on top of it as
04:54.620 - 04:59.120:  well and there was a rescue guy who was bringing these children and you know how they usually do
04:59.120 - 05:04.500:  that during like these very daredevil kind of stunts and all where they make sure that the person
05:04.500 - 05:10.040:  who they are rescuing is on top of them or at least on their backs and then they zip them right
05:10.040 - 05:16.080:  down to security. So they were brought down to the ground were they by zip wire? Yes. Yes they
05:16.080 - 05:20.920:  were yeah there was a zip wire and they were like using it to literally rescue the children and
05:20.920 - 05:25.920:  there is a video also it's all across social media now being shared because these rescue teams
05:25.920 - 05:30.440:  are being called heroes right now and this is how they made it possible that these people were
05:30.440 - 05:37.660:  rescued. And a general sense of relief I would imagine in Pakistan that this particular drama ended
05:37.660 - 05:42.640:  in the way that it did. Yes for sure because you know this is I think the fourth consecutive day that
05:42.640 - 05:47.360:  we have had really like terrible news regarding children they were all kinds of news coming in
05:47.420 - 05:51.400:  and they were really really heartbreaking and really sad also because they were all around sexual
05:51.400 - 05:55.940:  abuse and stuff like that where there's another case which is going to be heard tomorrow so this
05:55.940 - 06:00.880:  came as a very pleasant surprise that a lot of people were rescued and everybody on board was
06:00.880 - 06:07.340:  rescued so people are literally cheering for for now. Sahab Baloch in Pakistan speaking to Julian
06:07.340 - 06:13.300:  Marshall Altaf Hussein is a teacher who was on the scene today and he told Julian about the
06:13.300 - 06:22.020:  crowds who gathered to watch the rescue operation. There were people from the whole area
06:22.520 - 06:28.900:  some came from far to watch the rescue operation and later in the day a big contingent from the media
06:28.900 - 06:35.020:  arrived to report. They also clarified some mistakes they made earlier in the day. I'm a school
06:35.020 - 06:41.980:  teacher and I went there from my school everyone was very concerned. Do you yourself use these
06:42.140 - 06:52.060:  cable cars to travel from one place to another? I did not write this particular cable car
06:52.580 - 06:59.280:  but I did write other cable cars over the gorges in this region some even higher but as you know
06:59.280 - 07:06.660:  the infrastructure over here is not very good. These chairlips are not really safe for us.
07:07.200 - 07:12.340:  I don't think they were installed or maintained properly. The system is very poor.
07:13.060 - 07:19.520:  So will you continue to use these cable cars, these chairlips because of what has happened today?
07:22.580 - 07:28.080:  You know the thing is the local people are not very happy about the situation. They have always
07:28.080 - 07:34.260:  said that these cable cars were not installed properly. Now they're saying that they will not let
07:34.260 - 07:40.880:  them operate these cars in this area. But presumably they have to use them if they want to
07:41.720 - 07:51.360:  go about their jobs, their lives. These chairlips are a necessity because in this area the roads
07:51.360 - 07:58.020:  are pretty bad. We are an underdeveloped area. Not only roads but we also do not get other
07:58.020 - 08:05.300:  amenities. There is lack of electricity, little education or health facilities. Of course people
08:05.300 - 08:12.400:  in this area are physically strong. They can walk far but when it comes to cable cars they have no
08:12.400 - 08:18.820:  choice and have to use them but I think they will not be that keen to use them after today's incident.
08:19.620 - 08:23.900:  Teacher and eyewitness to that drama out of Hussein in Pakistan.
08:24.460 - 08:29.260:  The African Union has suspended Niger from all its activities because of the military
08:29.260 - 08:34.320:  coup last month. The organisation warned against any interference in the country from outside
08:34.320 - 08:40.120:  Africa, including by private military companies. After the head of the Wagner group of Russian
08:40.120 - 08:45.880:  mercenaries, Evgeny Pregoshin claimed to be on the continent. Here's our West Africa correspondent
08:45.880 - 08:52.320:  by any chance. The statement from the AU is dated to 14 for August but it was only released after
08:52.320 - 08:56.920:  Mr Pregoshin published a video claiming to be working in Africa. In the video the Wagner chief
08:56.920 - 09:01.900:  who appears to be in an arid landscape is stressed in military fatigues and carrying a rifle.
09:02.640 - 09:07.480:  Two trucks and half a dozen armed men are behind him in the distance. The BBC hasn't been able
09:07.480 - 09:17.740:  to verify the location of the video. We are working. The temperature is over 50 degrees,
09:17.740 - 09:23.880:  he claims. Everything we like. The Wagner group conducts reconnaissance. It makes Russia even greater
09:23.880 - 09:30.440:  on all continents and Africa even freer, he says, and rounds off with justice and happiness for
09:30.440 - 09:35.300:  the African people. Wagner has been accused of great human rights abuses in a number of African
09:35.300 - 09:40.820:  countries. Niger's Western allies feared a mercenary group could use the crisis there to strengthen
09:40.820 - 09:46.180:  its presence in the South region, south of the Sahara. It's already active in neighbouring Marley
09:46.180 - 09:50.860:  and Bukina Faso, which are both on the military rule. The West African Economic and Political
09:50.860 - 09:56.960:  Group Equas says it will send armed forces into Niger to return it to democracy. But the junters
09:56.960 - 10:02.140:  in Bukina Faso and Marley have vowed to support Niger's cool leaders against any foreign aggression
10:02.140 - 10:08.480:  leading to fears of a regional war. My any Jones. 18 people dead, their
10:08.480 - 10:13.800:  child bodies found not far from the Turkish border, victims of a wildfire in Northeastern Greece.
10:14.240 - 10:17.800:  The authorities say those killed by the flames are likely to have been migrants.
10:18.300 - 10:21.180:  Your original editor, Danny Aberhart, has more details.
10:21.840 - 10:27.200:  The Grim Discovery was confirmed by the Greek Fire Service. It's the worst tragedy so far from
10:27.200 - 10:32.120:  wildfires which have ravaged the area since Saturday. The authorities said that, as there
10:32.120 - 10:36.340:  had been no reports of missing residents, they were investigating whether the victims had entered
10:36.340 - 10:42.100:  the country illegally. Migrants regularly cross from Turkey, often hiding out in rural or
10:42.100 - 10:47.380:  forested areas to avoid being caught. Greece's immigration minister has said the incident once
10:47.380 - 10:52.700:  again highlighted the dangers of irregular migration. The fires around Alexanderupolis
10:52.700 - 10:57.740:  have led to a number of settlements being evacuated. Patients from a hospital, including
10:57.740 - 11:03.160:  newborn babies and people in intensive care, also had to be moved out hastily overnight to
11:03.160 - 11:09.000:  a ferry in the port when a wall of flame engulfed a nearby hillside. One hospital worker described
11:09.000 - 11:16.700:  chaotic scenes. I've never experienced this. I've been working for 27 years. It's like war
11:16.700 - 11:21.760:  conditions really, such as scattered everywhere. Patients here dripped there. We had to arrange
11:21.760 - 11:26.420:  them by clinic. We had to get them on their meds, their serums, everything. It's like a bomb drop.
11:28.740 - 11:33.720:  A number of other wildfires are burning across Greece. One has sent a pool of smoke over the
11:33.720 - 11:39.540:  capital, Athens, and prompted the authorities in a northern suburb to order evacuations. One
11:39.540 - 11:46.860:  resident described damage to properties. The fire has entered the urban area. Houses, shops are
11:46.860 - 11:51.520:  burning based on the information we have, and the bad thing is that the fire has surrounded us.
11:51.880 - 11:57.040:  The winds are now very strong, approaching 10 on the Beaufort scale. It's a very difficult
11:57.040 - 12:04.880:  fire-fighting task. God help us. Fast-moving conflagrations are in places threatening to trap
12:04.880 - 12:10.640:  emergency workers. A number of EU countries have already sent assistance to Greece, including
12:10.640 - 12:13.380:  water-bombing planes and teams of firefighters.
12:13.860 - 12:19.640:  Danny Abahart. Apart from Greece, this summer has already been marred by wildfires in Spain,
12:19.640 - 12:26.860:  Algeria, and Hawaii. Canada is also in the midst of its own wildfire season, about 30,000 people.
12:26.860 - 12:31.860:  In the western province of British Columbia have been moved from their homes, many of them from
12:31.860 - 12:36.920:  indigenous communities. Officials have said the blazes have shown some signs of easing, but
12:36.920 - 12:42.840:  thousands are still unable to return to their homes. Chief Robert Louis is the leader of the
12:42.840 - 12:48.680:  West Bank First Nation and himself in evacuee. He spoke to Peter Goffin about the threat to
12:48.680 - 12:53.340:  indigenous areas and the loss of traditional lands. We have several reserves.
12:54.420 - 13:02.500:  Iron number 10 reserve, which is closest to the city of Colona. Part of the reserve is evacuated,
13:03.220 - 13:12.980:  and the other part is on alert. So all in all, we must have one to 2,000 people in that evacuation.
13:13.740 - 13:16.360:  And where are people going when they leave their homes?
13:17.100 - 13:22.600:  Well, we're doing our best to accommodate as many people as we can, but they're all over.
13:22.740 - 13:30.700:  I mean, some are with family, like myself, for example. Some have moved into RVs for a while.
13:30.700 - 13:37.980:  I was told some were sleeping in their cars. Some have gone into emergency shelters.
13:38.780 - 13:46.060:  We have been working with the emergency services to try and provide whatever accommodation we can
13:46.060 - 13:51.440:  at our gymnasium, that sort of thing. But I was evacuated Friday. We're still in that evacuation
13:51.440 - 13:58.680:  mode. And most likely, the nearest I can figure from the emergency service personnel. I expect
13:58.680 - 14:04.160:  that will be all of this week before anyone's allowed to maybe consider returning.
14:04.960 - 14:11.300:  What does it feel like to leave your home and all of your belongings behind knowing they might
14:11.300 - 14:20.000:  be at risk from these fires? Well, that's a very high anxiety feeling. I think for those,
14:21.620 - 14:28.380:  maybe the elderly, I think is absolutely traumatic. I know of people that have broke down,
14:29.560 - 14:38.140:  and you know, and simply cried out of frustration and grief. Others take it with a grain of salt,
14:38.140 - 14:44.820:  and it's better to have your life. Your personal belongings is secondary. I think that's how
14:44.820 - 14:49.120:  you have to look at it as long as you have your life, your health and your family. I think that's
14:49.120 - 14:55.400:  number one. Are there challenges that are unique to an indigenous community when it comes
14:55.400 - 15:02.160:  to evacuating, as opposed to, say, a city? That's an interesting question. I mean, for us,
15:02.160 - 15:10.820:  we have an indigenous perspective of things. Here, we've got over 11,000 hectares of land that's
15:11.180 - 15:17.700:  burnt right now, and they're still telling how much more beyond that. But there's huge wildlife,
15:17.700 - 15:26.760:  for example, deer, bear, one individual caught on video, for example, a young fawn that was
15:26.760 - 15:35.000:  struggling in the water from the fires, without knowing where the doe was. That's a major concern
15:35.000 - 15:42.020:  from an indigenous perspective. Another major concern for us is that the mountains and is where we
15:42.020 - 15:49.160:  get our medicines and plants, and we know that we have certain sites that we harvest, and we know
15:49.160 - 15:53.940:  that there are sites now that are totally gone, totally burnt. We don't know what the devastation
15:53.940 - 16:03.160:  is, but we fear the worst. That kind of sets us a bit of a part. Of course, our peoples have been
16:03.160 - 16:08.660:  here for many thousands of years. The first peoples of these lands, and from what I can gather,
16:08.660 - 16:13.360:  at least in more recent times, the last few hundred times, this fire is unprecedented.
16:14.100 - 16:22.120:  Never, to the extent that our people can orally remember. So this is kind of eye-opening,
16:22.380 - 16:27.020:  and I guess it fits with climatic phases that's happening not only here, but around the world.
16:28.100 - 16:30.800:  Chief Robert Louis speaking to Peter Goffin.
16:33.320 - 16:34.800:  Still to come in this podcast.
16:42.520 - 16:46.300:  The rapper in Tunisia using her words to push for social change.
16:55.820 - 17:02.040:  The five countries that make up the BRICS trading block, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
17:02.480 - 17:07.020:  represent almost half the world's population and the quarter of the global economy,
17:07.380 - 17:13.920:  and many more countries now want to join. The leaders minus Vladimir Putin are meeting in Johannesburg
17:13.920 - 17:18.740:  together with at least 50 other heads of state and government. In advance of the summit,
17:18.740 - 17:23.580:  the Chinese President Xi Jinping meant the South African host Cyril Ramaphosa.
17:28.340 - 17:33.500:  We both believe that China and South Africa are major developing countries and emerging markets
17:33.500 - 17:39.920:  and join great influence. We should be global partners that uphold justice. We need to strengthen
17:39.920 - 17:46.400:  strategic cooperation and implement true multilateralism and work to boost the representation
17:46.400 - 17:53.220:  and the say of countries in the global South. Our correspondent Nomsomoseko is covering the
17:53.220 - 17:59.460:  summit in Johannesburg. Currently there are more than 20 other countries who have formally applied
17:59.460 - 18:06.120:  to join the group, and those countries include Africa's biggest economy, Nigeria, also Egypt,
18:06.120 - 18:13.640:  Argentina, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. However, it does not seem possible that all of them will be
18:13.640 - 18:20.260:  accepted to be part of the group we are told that if any I accept it, it's going to be about four
18:20.260 - 18:25.920:  or five of them. At the same time, we don't know when exactly that is going to be announced, whether
18:26.340 - 18:31.520:  that announcement is going to happen at this summit or that it will happen at a later stage,
18:31.520 - 18:38.880:  because it's not all the five countries representing bricks that are for the expansion of the
18:38.880 - 18:45.120:  group with Brazil, saying that expanding the group is something that they are not for. However,
18:45.640 - 18:50.660:  both South Africa and China are saying that they think that an expansion could be possible.
18:51.020 - 18:58.100:  One notable absence though Vladimir Putin. Indeed, it was highly anticipated that he would be here,
18:58.100 - 19:04.620:  but facing possible arrests because of alleged war crimes that he is facing. That's why he did
19:04.620 - 19:11.680:  not come, but he did address the summit here via a pre-recorded message in which he said that
19:11.680 - 19:19.260:  the de-dolarization of bricks member states was inevitable and irreversible, and he also spoke
19:19.260 - 19:25.580:  about strengthening trade relations within the bricks member states as well, and also saying that
19:25.580 - 19:32.500:  it was an obligation for Russia to ensure that it does deal with reducing hunger and providing
19:32.500 - 19:35.860:  trade to poor countries, particularly African countries.
19:36.200 - 19:42.320:  No, I'm Samasako. Donald Trump says he'll hand himself into the authorities in the U.S.
19:42.320 - 19:47.580:  state of Georgia on Thursday. The former U.S. President denies charges of racketeering and
19:47.580 - 19:53.240:  election interference in the swing state. While Mr. Trump prepares for his booking appearance in
19:53.240 - 19:58.760:  the city of Atlanta, his fellow Republican presidential hopefuls will be in the state of Wisconsin
19:58.780 - 20:04.560:  for their first debate. Justin Webb heard more from our North America reporter Anthony Zirka.
20:04.980 - 20:09.380:  In this case, he has just been booked. He's not being arraigned. The arraigned part of it is where
20:09.660 - 20:14.420:  he appears before a judge. That's going to happen at the beginning of September, but this is just
20:14.420 - 20:20.660:  him getting processed at the Fulton County prison. He's going to show up. He's going to have his
20:20.660 - 20:25.340:  mug shot taken, apparently, this time, which is something slightly new. Fingerprinted to have his
20:25.340 - 20:32.180:  information taken down. He's going to have to post a $200,000 bail that is money that he has to
20:32.180 - 20:38.300:  put up in order to be allowed not to stay in prison, but to go back on his own reconnaissance,
20:38.300 - 20:43.680:  and that money would be forfeit if for some reason he decides not to show up for future judicial
20:43.680 - 20:49.820:  proceedings. And then he goes on his way. And what's he said about it? Well, he was posting on his
20:49.820 - 20:54.300:  social media account. Nothing particularly new. He did say that he was going to be doing this
20:54.300 - 20:59.740:  on Thursday. That was open to speculation. Some people thought maybe he would do it on Wednesday,
20:59.740 - 21:05.240:  at the same time the Republicans were debating as a way of kind of upstaging his adversaries for
21:05.240 - 21:10.560:  the Republican presidential nomination. He once again called it a political episode, a political
21:10.560 - 21:16.460:  charging that it was all contrived in order to try to interfere with his attempt to regain the
21:16.460 - 21:21.700:  White House, lashed out against Fannie Willis, the district attorney, who was heading up the
21:21.700 - 21:27.480:  charges against him, said that it was corrupt. And that was the same sort of line Donald Trump has had
21:27.960 - 21:32.040:  in regards to all of the charges against him in these multiple indictments. You mentioned a
21:32.040 - 21:36.600:  debate, Anthony. That's a debate, of course, which he's not going to take part in. Exactly. He
21:36.600 - 21:41.760:  decided to give a pass to the debate. And there is certainly a strategic argument for what he's
21:41.760 - 21:46.760:  doing. He has a massive lead in the polls right now. But what I think we're going to see now is
21:46.760 - 21:51.840:  a debate stage without him on it, where all of these Republican rivals are kind of vying for attention.
21:52.240 - 21:55.940:  And I think there's going to be more pressure on people like Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis,
21:55.940 - 22:01.200:  and Vivek Ramaswamy, who is a tech entrepreneur who's running for the Republican nomination.
22:01.520 - 22:07.080:  All of them are going to try to do something that generates headlines and generates media coverage
22:07.640 - 22:12.840:  beyond just Wednesday evening, because if there aren't as many eyeballs watching on Wednesday
22:12.840 - 22:18.160:  evening to have any impact from this debate, they're going to have to do something newsworthy.
22:18.160 - 22:22.360:  And that's going to make them try to be a little more aggressive perhaps on the stage towards each
22:22.360 - 22:26.460:  other since Donald Trump's not going to be there. Anthony Zaka.
22:27.600 - 22:32.640:  When members of Italian high society gathered in Chirin to celebrate the engagement of the
22:32.640 - 22:39.660:  bank at Massimo Segre and the entrepreneur Cristina Cimandi, things didn't quite go as planned.
22:40.220 - 22:46.600:  In a shocking speech, Mr. Segre accused his fiancee of infidelity and ended the relationship.
22:46.600 - 22:52.220:  She's now accused him of gender violence after clips of that speech went viral and she is
22:52.220 - 22:55.680:  threatening legal action. David Lewis has been following the story.
22:56.220 - 23:03.040:  It was supposed to be a night of unbridled joy, romantic celebration, and true love.
23:03.600 - 23:09.180:  But in a speech to the assembled guests, the groom to be, well, he had other ideas.
23:14.120 - 23:22.100:  Tonight, I'd like to give Cristina the freedom to love, to love someone a well-known lawyer
23:22.880 - 23:30.700:  whom she clearly cares for more than me. My dear Cristina, I know how much you are in love,
23:31.440 - 23:36.740:  but mentally and sexually. How did you manage to keep it to yourself?
23:37.860 - 23:43.780:  And I know that before him, you had a relationship with a well-known industrialist.
23:44.060 - 23:49.220:  With his fiancee watching on, the 64-year-old continued to deliver a devastating
23:49.220 - 23:55.440:  account of their relationship and her alleged cheating. He said he was heartbroken and was
23:55.440 - 24:01.240:  leaving her that night, guests including big bankers and businessmen who cheered as he took
24:01.240 - 24:06.740:  to the microphone, listened in stunned silence. Mr. Segre finished with an apology.
24:08.060 - 24:15.020:  I wish you all the happiness with your new partner and to continue shining in the world
24:15.100 - 24:22.180:  as you have done all these years. Sorry to all of you and good night.
24:24.200 - 24:27.540:  It's not clear who recorded the footage at the Millionaire's Mansion,
24:27.540 - 24:32.480:  and if it was the same person who leaked the video. Since the speech went viral,
24:32.480 - 24:38.260:  the now ex-couple have been trading barbs in the Italian press. When he started talking,
24:38.260 - 24:44.220:  I thought it was a joke, Mrs. Mande told the Italian newspaper Il Corriera della Cera.
24:44.220 - 24:51.100:  Then I was petrified. It was an act of abhorrent violence, she added. An adviser to Mrs. Mande,
24:51.100 - 24:56.960:  social probably take legal action after facing a barrage of negative comments on social media.
24:57.520 - 25:04.020:  Mr. Segre's lawyers say he never authorised the filming or sharing of his engagement party address.
25:04.740 - 25:05.300:  David Lewis
25:06.480 - 25:12.840:  Over the last few months, the Saudi pro league also known as the SPL has shaken the football world
25:12.840 - 25:18.400:  by signing a string of high-profile players from famous European teams on record salaries.
25:18.900 - 25:23.620:  Last week, the Brazilian start Namar became the latest to sign up to the Saudi league
25:23.940 - 25:29.660:  in a deal worth almost $100 million. On Saturday, he was unveiled in front of thousands of fans.
25:29.660 - 25:35.940:  Saudi clubs have collectively spent over $650 million during the summer transfer window
25:35.940 - 25:40.060:  to attract foreign players such as Karim Benzema and Golo Kante,
25:40.480 - 25:45.200:  Saudi Mande, among a sleuth of big names. BBC's Middle East business correspondent
25:45.200 - 25:48.800:  Samir Hashmi travelled to Riyadh to find out more.
25:49.460 - 25:56.900:  A rapturous welcome for Namar at his new club Al-Hilal. Al-Hilal is one of Asia's most successful clubs.
25:57.400 - 26:02.020:  For many supporters, Namar's arrival marks the beginning of a new era for the team.
26:02.900 - 26:11.680:  Namar is a superstar player, Brazilian leader and he will bring a lot of
26:12.840 - 26:14.520:  thanks for Al-Hilal.
26:16.260 - 26:19.680:  We are so happy that stars like Cristiano name are playing here in Saudi.
26:21.160 - 26:25.040:  We hope that the Saudi league will become as good as the other leagues in Europe.
26:27.480 - 26:31.560:  A couple of months ago, the top four Saudi football clubs including Al-Hilal
26:31.880 - 26:36.040:  were bought over by the PIF, the government controlled sovereign well fund.
26:36.920 - 26:41.880:  This has enabled Saudi clubs to offer eye-watering salaries to attract some of the top names in football,
26:42.460 - 26:48.140:  including Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. During the summer, there has been an influx of foreign
26:48.140 - 26:53.840:  players. One of them is Portuguese footballer Rubin Neves, who swapped the English Premier League
26:54.180 - 26:56.460:  for the Saudi pro league and joined Al-Hilal.
26:57.240 - 27:00.660:  If you see the difference between this league now and a lot of other leagues,
27:01.840 - 27:05.880:  there are no differences. I think people at the beginning, when the team started to
27:06.020 - 27:11.000:  sign players that people didn't believe in this project, but I think everyone now is excited
27:11.000 - 27:14.600:  to see this league. Everyone now wants to see this league.
27:15.220 - 27:20.480:  Sports is one of the main pillars of the country's Vision 2030 Economic Diversification Program,
27:20.480 - 27:25.620:  which aims to reduce Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil revenues by building new industries
27:25.620 - 27:30.980:  and attracting more foreign capital. Some European leagues have criticized the strategy adopted
27:30.980 - 27:36.480:  by the SPL, but Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nora says that they are focusing on making the
27:36.480 - 27:43.980:  project financially viable. We have commitments to support this for however long it takes
27:44.800 - 27:49.380:  to deliver on the objectives of the strategies. However, the responsibility that we have against
27:49.380 - 27:55.540:  that commitment is to also fit that commercialization element of the strategy and start increasing
27:55.540 - 28:01.080:  that so that we can be responsible for our own financial growth in the future and not to be
28:01.080 - 28:07.340:  wholly dependent on the government. I'm walking on Teheliya Street, which is located in the heart of
28:07.340 - 28:13.280:  Riyadh. Now this place is really popular because it's flooded with a lot of cafes,
28:13.280 - 28:21.660:  Shisha bars, restaurants, why? Because Riyadh's home team Al Nasser, the club that Cristiano Ronaldo
28:21.660 - 28:35.580:  plays for, is an action right now. Saudi Arabia is a football crazy nation with 80
28:35.580 - 28:39.800:  percent of the population either playing, attending or watching the sport on TV.
28:40.740 - 28:45.780:  The Kingdom's target is to elevate SPL in the world's top 10 in terms of revenues by 2030.
28:46.620 - 28:50.380:  It's still early to judge whether these bold investments would pay off in the long run,
28:50.380 - 28:55.060:  but the strategy has demonstrated the Gulf nation's ambition of becoming
29:04.300 - 29:07.760:  immediate international football hub. BBC's Middle East Business Correspondent Samir Hashmi
29:08.280 - 29:14.040:  Now to Chinesia and a young woman who is turning her sensitivity and her gift with words,
29:14.620 - 29:22.800:  into art. Fatan Ben Khaled, aka FBK, is a rare thing, a female rapper in Chinesia and she's
29:22.800 - 29:28.260:  using her voice to fight for the improvement of society and women's equality. As she told the
29:28.260 - 29:31.300:  BBC's African Music Program, this is Africa.
29:39.500 - 29:46.940:  The truth is, with rap in Tunisia, the revolution had a very big role to play. Many artists
29:46.940 - 29:50.820:  now dare to find a way to make their voice heard. Because we know what it was like before
29:50.820 - 29:55.980:  the revolution. The revolution opened the doors, especially for rappers. Now they can express
29:55.980 - 30:00.840:  their opinions on the political situation, on the social situation. This was forbidden before.
30:01.440 - 30:05.740:  But now we have the opportunity to express ourselves. We have to try, as hard as we can,
30:06.340 - 30:10.420:  to make our voices heard, to try to change what was happening, even just a little bit.
30:27.340 - 30:32.360:  I wrote a song called Cezarian. I decided to do it because people wanted to know who FBK is,
30:32.780 - 30:37.140:  who Fatan is. They wanted to know more about my personality, my beginnings, my childhood.
30:37.760 - 30:42.240:  Today, Cezarian is still the song that helps people understand me and get to know me better.
30:58.240 - 31:03.780:  Where do I get the inspiration to my songs? Okay, the truth is, I'm very free and open to
31:03.780 - 31:08.420:  different and varied sources. An artist must open their heads to the universe. I get inspired
31:08.420 - 31:12.980:  by nature, by my experiences, and by other people's experiences, too, when they touch me.
31:13.920 - 31:18.020:  Situations can happen to someone else and maybe it doesn't affect them. Maybe they don't feel it,
31:18.060 - 31:22.440:  but we know that artists are particularly sensitive and I'm sometimes excessively sensitive.
31:22.960 - 31:25.720:  I try to use that to write about things that touch me.
31:53.920 - 32:01.380:  In my experience, human beings encounter obstacles in their early stages. But what is noticeable
32:01.500 - 32:07.040:  is the huge control over women that men have in Arab societies in general and in Tunisian society
32:07.040 - 32:11.540:  in particular. There are big challenges for women who want to be represented in Tunisia.
32:11.980 - 32:16.800:  Those women may encounter all sorts of exploitation. People say, how else is a woman?
32:17.260 - 32:22.520:  You know, there's a lot of the little in this day and it's normal because in our society men
32:22.520 - 32:26.760:  have power over women and women also get judged by their own family. For example, they would say,
32:27.320 - 32:32.340:  how come she sings rap? It's a boy thing. There is this cliche about rap that it's in a moral art,
32:32.340 - 32:37.720:  that it's no good, a young female rapper can be accused of masculinity. But that has nothing to do
32:37.720 - 32:42.300:  with anything because art has never been linked or limited to a specific gender. Art is general,
32:42.300 - 32:47.900:  art is inclusive, art is universal. These views have to do with the ignorance of those who say them.
32:48.280 - 32:53.080:  As far as I'm concerned, I'm trying to move forward as much as possible. I'm trying to make progress
32:53.080 - 32:59.380:  in what I do when I'm trying to go beyond the Arab world, to go global. God willing, I'll get there.
32:59.820 - 33:00.300:  Thank you.
33:10.420 - 33:12.240:  Fatan Ben Khaled
33:15.240 - 33:20.860:  And that's all from us for now. But there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
33:21.180 - 33:24.600:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
33:25.220 - 33:31.900:  you can send us an email. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on
33:31.900 - 33:38.580:  x, formerly known as Twitter, at Global News Pod. This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll
33:38.940 - 33:45.740:  and the producer was Stephanie Prentice. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson. Until next time, goodbye.
