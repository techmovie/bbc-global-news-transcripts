00:39.780 - 00:46.260:  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Monday August the 7th, these are our main stories.
00:46.820 - 00:54.680:  We don't have weapons but we do have our hearts. We have our blood and we've decided to put our
00:54.700 - 00:59.760:  blood at the service of our country's defence. This is why we are deployed not only at the main
00:59.760 - 01:06.020:  crossroads in near me but also at many points and crossroads in the interior. Marley and
01:06.020 - 01:10.940:  Bacuna Faso agreed to provide what they call a joint delegation to aid the generals behind
01:10.940 - 01:16.940:  Niger's coup as they warn hostile neighbours against sending troops in. A worsening security
01:16.940 - 01:23.240:  situation in Ethiopia with fighting in Amhara and a reported mass roundup in Addis Ababa.
01:23.680 - 01:29.840:  And Donald Trump's legal team must respond to the US Justice Department by 5pm local time.
01:32.740 - 01:39.240:  Also in this podcast we find out the link between our feathered friends and good human mental health.
01:40.700 - 01:48.620:  The position of Niger's generals defying an ultimatum to reinstate the elected president
01:48.620 - 01:54.300:  closing its airspace and preparing for defence will only have been bolstered by two other
01:54.300 - 01:59.320:  countries run by military governments. Marley and Bacuna Faso, they've said they'll send a
01:59.320 - 02:05.120:  joint delegation in solidarity in the face of possible armed intervention from other West African
02:05.420 - 02:11.620:  states. The French national airline has now suspended flights to the capitals of Marley and Bacuna Faso,
02:11.960 - 02:17.400:  meanwhile the regional block ECOAS is divided over weather to act militarily. And as
02:17.400 - 02:22.660:  your spokesman Amadou Abdramane said his country would resist any interference.
02:27.020 - 02:33.360:  Niger's armed forces and all our defence and security forces backed by the unfailing support
02:33.360 - 02:38.680:  of our people are ready to defend the integrity of our territory and the honor of our homeland.
02:39.480 - 02:42.920:  This demonstrator said people stood resolutely behind the coup leaders.
02:46.040 - 02:51.340:  We don't have weapons but we do have our hearts. We have our blood and we've decided to put our
02:51.340 - 02:56.420:  blood at the service of our country's defence. This is why we are deployed not only at the main
02:56.420 - 03:00.580:  crossroads in Yemen but also at many points in crossroads in the interior.
03:01.500 - 03:06.160:  The army said it believes preparations to invade Niger have begun but gave no evidence.
03:06.160 - 03:11.100:  Earlier I spoke to Chris Ewaka who's on the border between Nigeria and Niger.
03:11.780 - 03:18.500:  Right now at the border here there is some form of tension amongst the people of the border
03:18.500 - 03:24.780:  communities essentially because if there's going to be any particular lesser deployment for
03:24.780 - 03:32.420:  instance if Echoas chooses to deploy they would be the one that will be well affected.
03:32.540 - 03:36.040:  Are they already affected as a result of the border closure because all their businesses
03:36.040 - 03:41.680:  appear to have been grounded. But right now what we've seen is a form of defiance from the
03:41.680 - 03:50.320:  coup leaders in Yemen and we've also seen the kind of support seemingly from the people especially
03:50.320 - 03:58.080:  in the capital and which appear to be bolstering the energy of the coup leaders who also got in
03:58.080 - 04:04.880:  the support of some West African neighbors. So why are Marley and Bikina Faso being so supportive?
04:05.200 - 04:10.620:  Well right now what we know is that Marley and Bikina Faso they are French-speaking countries
04:10.620 - 04:16.460:  they've been on the same colonial power that's under France would have been the colonial power
04:17.080 - 04:24.760:  at a time and currently they are also ruled by the military so it is more like showing solidarity to
04:24.760 - 04:34.120:  another comrades who has now joined a league so with Bikina Faso Marley sharing common boundaries
04:34.120 - 04:41.700:  making a 3-song it could also help in bolstering the the uphold the holds of Bikina Faso
04:41.900 - 04:50.440:  military junta and that of Marley in power why they will help the Niger group to consolidate however
04:50.460 - 04:59.880:  this is what the Ekoaz leadership is really angry about and wants to stop because they fear that
04:59.880 - 05:06.160:  any consolidation of power by the military within the sub-region coup also encourage for that coup
05:06.560 - 05:12.800:  which would destabilize the region and don't forget too that within these two countries they
05:12.800 - 05:20.820:  having common these groups links to Islamic states group as well as al-Qaeda that are actually
05:22.380 - 05:29.840:  creating havoc in the Sahel. Chris Ewaqa and staying in Africa tension in Ethiopia's Amharah
05:29.840 - 05:34.360:  region between the army and local militias has been on the rise for months and now fighting
05:34.360 - 05:39.260:  between them has worsened over the weekend thousands of people were reportedly arrested
05:39.260 - 05:45.160:  in the capital Addis Ababa. Calcutta and Ibaltel is there and gave me more details about those
05:45.160 - 05:52.780:  detentions. According to you know activists particularly online with the militia group that are
05:52.800 - 05:57.860:  fighting these people were ethnically profiled that's what they accused the government of
05:58.560 - 06:03.600:  and they were members of the Amharah ethnic group that live and reside in Adis Ababa that there
06:03.600 - 06:07.900:  were arrested and some of them were detained in schools and then they were transported to different
06:07.900 - 06:13.980:  detention centers. The government has not provided any figures about that but in a statement to
06:13.980 - 06:19.240:  journalists over the weekend the communications minister here confirmed that they have indeed been
06:19.240 - 06:24.820:  arrests made he said that these arrests made were made in connection with with the violence in
06:24.820 - 06:30.520:  Amharah region. Our Africa editor Richard Hamilton told me more about the background to the conflict.
06:31.260 - 06:38.280:  In April the federal government said it was dismantling regional militia with the intention of
06:38.460 - 06:44.560:  integrating them into the national army but this has been seen particularly in the Amharah ethnic
06:44.560 - 06:50.900:  region as a move to undermine regional authority and they're worried that it will leave them
06:50.900 - 06:57.400:  vulnerable to attacks from outsiders or rebel groups. Now the Ethiopian Prime Minister Abbi Ahmed
06:57.400 - 07:04.080:  has tried to unify Ethiopia which has in the past traditionally been fragmented into different
07:04.080 - 07:12.180:  ethnic regions and national unity you'd think sounds like an admirable goal but what we saw in
07:12.180 - 07:18.720:  Tigray was a terrible brutal war that that crushed the Tigrians and committed human rights abuses
07:18.720 - 07:24.780:  and tens of thousands of people were killed millions displaced. There's been a ceasefire now but
07:24.780 - 07:31.480:  there've been calls for Abbi Ahmed to return the Nobel Peace Prize that he won in 2019 for
07:31.480 - 07:39.020:  ending the conflict with Eritrea and the Amharah forces actually helped the federal troops in Tigray
07:39.480 - 07:45.780:  but it now looks as if Addis Ababa is turning its attention on the Amharah region and trying to
07:46.220 - 07:53.500:  weaken it and on Friday it declared a state of emergency in Amharah and this gives them power to
07:53.500 - 08:00.560:  impose curfews ban for example the carrying of guns and weapons ban public gatherings maker
08:00.560 - 08:07.940:  rests conduct searches without warrants and limit media outlets and broadcasts and the US in
08:07.940 - 08:14.180:  particular express concern about the situation in the Amharah so basically it's a very worrying
08:14.180 - 08:21.200:  development. Richard Hamilton now to America where Donald Trump's legal team have a deadline of 5
08:21.200 - 08:26.580:  pm local time to respond to the US Justice Department which is seeking to limit what the
08:26.580 - 08:32.640:  former president says in public about his election interference case. Mr. Trump has already
08:32.640 - 08:38.720:  suggested that the judge Tanya Chukton should be removed from his case because he says she will
08:38.720 - 08:45.040:  not give him a fair trial. I spoke to CBS News reporter Wendy Gillette. If it is granted this
08:45.040 - 08:50.740:  protective order would do a couple of things potentially stop Trump from making any sort of
08:50.740 - 08:56.520:  threatening remarks on social media and prevent him from sharing any evidence in the case prosecutors
08:56.520 - 09:03.380:  referenced a Trump post he made on Friday he wrote if you go after me I'm coming after you just
09:03.380 - 09:09.920:  one example of Trump's comments both online and during speeches in which he attacks witnesses in
09:09.920 - 09:16.620:  cases against him political opponents and lately the special counsel himself Jack Smith the other
09:16.620 - 09:22.220:  day he called them deranged. Trump's legal team wanted more time to respond to this request for
09:22.220 - 09:27.960:  a protective order they asked for a few more days but the federal judge said no. Doesn't this play
09:27.960 - 09:33.020:  though to well Donald Trump's narrative in a way in that he he's going to try and make out he's
09:33.020 - 09:38.300:  being gagged here isn't he and that may play well with his electoral base. Yeah exactly he has
09:38.300 - 09:43.140:  railed against the Justice Department saying the indictments are just an attempt to silence him
09:43.140 - 09:49.580:  and his campaign and a lot of people believe that the majority of republicans certainly believe that
09:49.580 - 09:55.800:  he says the charges have no merit that they're baseless he calls it another Russia hoax and says
09:55.800 - 10:01.900:  that Smith is mentally ill and he's also still calling the election rigged and saying he was the
10:01.900 - 10:08.520:  rightful winner. And he wants the judge in the case Tanya Chukton to be removed saying he won't
10:08.520 - 10:14.020:  get a fair trial does he have any grounds to get the judge removed or any justification for saying
10:14.020 - 10:20.020:  that. No no justifications at this point just basically saying we can't get a fair trial in
10:20.020 - 10:26.680:  Washington because it's too liberal his lawyers have suggested possibly moving the trial to West
10:26.680 - 10:32.860:  Virginia but there's no real legal basis for it and the legal experts say it's doubtful that
10:32.860 - 10:38.540:  that is actually going to happen. Wendy Gillette he was one of the world's longest serving leaders
10:38.540 - 10:43.940:  but last month the Prime Minister of Cambodia Hun Sen announced that after nearly four decades in
10:43.940 - 10:49.740:  power he would step down and hand over power to his eldest son. Now the King of Cambodia has
10:49.740 - 10:55.580:  officially appointed Hun Manit to succeed his father as Prime Minister. The change at the top
10:55.580 - 11:00.980:  if it is one follows elections which the opposition labeled a sham it was barred from running
11:00.980 - 11:07.820:  candidates and the ruling party claimed all but five seats so is this a dynasty in the making Jonathan
11:07.820 - 11:13.840:  Head is our Southeast Asia correspondent. It looks like it doesn't it and it's not just one family's
11:13.840 - 11:18.860:  dynasty I mean Cambodia is a country with very weak institutions and it's more or less run by
11:19.380 - 11:23.580:  a collection of families with Hun Sen the most powerful figure but a lot of other big families who
11:23.580 - 11:28.700:  got very rich and powerful with him many of them are also ministers and some of them are also
11:28.700 - 11:33.500:  handing over to their children the Defence Minister and the Interior Minister among them two very
11:33.500 - 11:38.360:  powerful positions so not just one dynasty but several dynasties in the making I think it's a
11:38.360 - 11:43.960:  mark of how nervous the leaders are about this transition that they're handing over to their own
11:43.960 - 11:48.120:  families it doesn't look like they trust anybody else in the business of power and of course
11:48.460 - 11:53.700:  it does give I suppose some element of continuity for Cambodians because Hun Sen's the only leader
11:53.700 - 11:59.120:  they've known for four decades what do Cambodians feel about this well if they're critical of it
11:59.180 - 12:04.100:  they'll be keeping pretty quiet because it's very risky to be critical of Hun Sen you know opposition
12:04.100 - 12:09.720:  leaders have found they're either jailed prosecuted or driven into exile they have been political
12:09.720 - 12:17.200:  activists killed so whatever Cambodians feel I suspect some of them are you know unhappy about
12:17.200 - 12:21.440:  that the chronic corruption and inequality in the country they're kind of repacious environmental
12:21.440 - 12:27.200:  destruction that's gone on under Hun Sen others particularly older Cambodians actually appreciate
12:27.200 - 12:32.440:  Hun Sen's strong leadership the fact that they've had a quarter century of peace and development
12:32.440 - 12:37.440:  after some pretty dreadful years in the 20th century so I think feelings will be mixed so from
12:37.440 - 12:42.160:  what you're saying it doesn't sound like much is actually going to change it won't because
12:42.460 - 12:48.700:  Hunminets an untested figure in politics he's been prominent in the army he's also completely
12:48.700 - 12:54.600:  different from his father his father had this searing experience of fighting in the civil war
12:54.600 - 13:00.820:  in Cambodia of being under the Khmer Rouge is a very very tough wildly street smart man Hunminets
13:00.820 - 13:06.140:  been brought up in a very wealthy comfortable family he's Western educated but because he's
13:06.140 - 13:11.020:  inexperienced his father is keeping quite important political positions and has made it clear he
13:11.020 - 13:15.880:  will continue to influence things from behind the scenes this is a very big moment for Cambodia but
13:15.880 - 13:21.480:  as a political transition it's one that Hun Sen intends to manage and to take some time over to
13:21.480 - 13:26.660:  be sure that his son can be properly embedded and that he doesn't face any challenges from other
13:26.660 - 13:33.240:  people and other political factions in the country Jonathan had three years after crowds poured
13:33.240 - 13:38.960:  onto the streets across Biela Rousse protesting against a rigged presidential election some of its
13:38.960 - 13:44.900:  highest profile political prisoners are being held in isolation denied visits cause or even letters
13:44.900 - 13:51.800:  to their families for months on end they include Maria Cole Esnikova who was sentenced to 11 years
13:51.800 - 13:57.720:  jail for her role in the peaceful street rallies which were eventually crushed by police using
13:57.720 - 14:03.680:  violence no one has heard from her since February and even now security forces are still hunting out
14:03.680 - 14:09.960:  and arresting opponents of Alexander Lukashenko's long rule our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah
14:09.960 - 14:19.360:  Rainesford reports we will win all together because evil will defeat itself Maria
14:19.360 - 14:24.540:  Kalasnikova's prison letters to her sister were always upbeat keep strong and everything will
14:24.540 - 14:29.440:  be alright even as she served an 11 year sentence for protesting against the authoritarian rule
14:29.640 - 14:36.260:  of Alexander Lukashenko your sister Maria but in February the letters to Tatiana with their
14:36.260 - 14:42.380:  smiley faces suddenly stopped Maria's family and her lawyer have been unable to see her either
14:42.760 - 14:48.860:  in almost six months it became a incomelly father detention when you don't have any news
14:49.480 - 14:55.560:  which must be pretty scary right for you for sure yeah I could just hope that it will not break her
14:56.680 - 15:04.940:  but of course it influences anyone's mind in the end we know what you did to your sister three
15:04.940 - 15:10.580:  years ago Maria Kalasnikova was one of the leaders of a giant wave of protests against a rigged
15:10.580 - 15:20.360:  election for president she was hugely popular energizing the crowds in the end those protests were
15:20.360 - 15:31.600:  crushed with mass arrests and police violence but the protest spirit hasn't died instead Belarusians
15:31.600 - 15:40.540:  have got creative in borsal I met two women dressed up as granis in housecoats and head scarves
15:41.140 - 15:48.580:  chatting and cackling on a sofa and blowing their noses they were filming a skit for social media
15:48.580 - 15:55.560:  with a photo of Lukashenko propped up behind them like an icon they were sending up his supporters
15:56.340 - 16:05.080:  fighting a repressive regime with laughter the granny activists bled Belarus after the protests
16:05.080 - 16:12.160:  like tens of thousands Anna says her home has been searched her relatives threatened but she can't
16:12.160 - 16:21.720:  stay silent I think it's a betrayal maybe that's too harsh of me but if we forget all the people
16:21.720 - 16:30.440:  in prison then we're betraying them if we don't speak out who will in Belarus everyone is silent
16:30.460 - 16:39.560:  because it's impossible to say think there and there's no need to say so every week she
16:39.560 - 16:45.940:  organizes a rally in Warsaw to chant for a free Belarus and freedom for the political prisoners there
16:49.520 - 16:55.300:  all the key opposition figures are now being denied visits calls or letters we're here because we
16:55.300 - 17:02.360:  want our country to be free and democratic and we fight for it there's just 30 or so protesters here
17:02.700 - 17:08.180:  in the center of Warsaw wrapped in the red and white's Belarusian opposition flag of course
17:08.640 - 17:13.900:  it's nothing like the scale of the protests that we saw three years ago inside Belarus itself it
17:13.900 - 17:20.000:  is hard to keep that protesters alive here in exile but that's what they are trying to do and
17:20.000 - 17:24.740:  to tell anyone who listened that the repression inside their country hasn't stopped
17:28.740 - 17:32.960:  spending in the crowd there's a young woman her arms painted with dramatic tattoos
17:34.040 - 17:39.920:  Inga escaped Belarus after three months in prison she was arrested two years after the mass
17:41.020 - 17:45.440:  when police found a picture of her on a friend's phone draped in an opposition flag
17:48.580 - 17:54.620:  she tells me the women in prison were treated like animals but it's something else that upsets her
17:58.000 - 18:03.480:  when you get arrested and the whole prison is full of political detainees it's insane
18:05.200 - 18:11.940:  it feels like a nightmare all these amazing educated people are all in prison that's so hard
18:17.120 - 18:21.960:  but don't even have the right to speak we're locked up in prison just for our words
18:30.520 - 18:35.340:  I remember when Belarusian activists would shrug off the long sentences given to their protest
18:35.340 - 18:40.360:  leaders like Maria Kolesnikova they were sure Lukashenko wouldn't last that long
18:44.080 - 18:49.400:  three years on they're singing their protest songs in exile and many prisoners are being
18:49.400 - 18:54.540:  punished even further now not freed held in total isolation
18:58.980 - 19:05.380:  Sarah Reinsford research carried out at the US has made a connection between mental health
19:05.380 - 19:09.740:  conditions and the diversity of birds in a region Terry Egan reports
19:12.680 - 19:17.420:  the emphasis on the healthful effects of nature is often placed on green spaces
19:17.420 - 19:24.400:  lush open fields cloudless blue skies this research highlights the importance of a diversity
19:24.400 - 19:30.580:  of birds to that equation it seems the lower that diversity of birds is the higher the number
19:30.580 - 19:36.640:  of hospital admissions related to mental health conditions the research was carried out in the
19:36.640 - 19:43.060:  US state of Michigan and compared the observations of birds done by citizen scientists with hospital
19:43.060 - 19:50.000:  admissions for anxiety and mood disorders it suggested a direct correlation and follows on
19:50.000 - 19:55.540:  from research conducted last year suggesting that watching birds or listening to bird song
19:55.540 - 20:03.340:  was linked to mental well-being with the effects lasting up to eight hours the lead author Dr. Rachel
20:03.340 - 20:10.200:  Buckston said this had wider implications if species diversity can affect mental health at the
20:10.200 - 20:15.940:  severe end of the spectrum then it's possible the decline in biodiversity across the globe
20:15.940 - 20:23.120:  may be intricately connected with our anxiety and mood in general investing in nature she said
20:23.760 - 20:30.220:  improving and conserving communities of birds should not be viewed as a luxury but a necessity
20:32.700 - 20:42.100:  Terry Egan still to come on the podcast we felt that it was not a safe environment to be in
20:42.480 - 20:47.120:  and we knew when we took that decision how difficult that was going to be for young people who've
20:47.120 - 20:54.100:  spent two years raising money why despite years of planning a 40,000 strong scout gathering
20:54.100 - 21:07.180:  is being called off in South Korea do you ever feel a bit overwhelmed when you check the news on
21:07.180 - 21:12.460:  your phone first thing in the morning ever I open up my phone they're just endless warnings of
21:12.460 - 21:17.240:  more extreme weather to come I'm Hannah I'm the presenter of a new podcast called What in the World
21:17.260 - 21:22.420:  from the BBC World Service we're going to be here trying to help you make sense of the world around
21:22.420 - 21:28.420:  you so you can feel a little bit better about what's happening in the world you can find what in the
21:28.420 - 21:42.040:  world wherever you get your BBC podcasts and now the sound there as India's main opposition leader
21:42.040 - 21:47.960:  Rahul Gandhi was welcomed back into parliament having been reinstated as an MP he'd been sentenced
21:47.960 - 21:54.080:  to two years jail for defaming the prime minister but that's now been revoked so what will it mean
21:54.080 - 22:00.060:  a question for our South Asia regional editor and barassan at a russian this is a big boost for
22:00.060 - 22:06.260:  the main opposition congress party as you heard how the MPs from the congress party and not only from
22:06.260 - 22:12.900:  the congress also alliance partners were cheering as Mr Gandhi was coming to parliament building as they
22:12.900 - 22:19.060:  have a debate on a no confidence vote against the government so what they were arguing was the
22:19.060 - 22:25.720:  whole case was politically motivated this was all to prevent Mr Gandhi from raising uncomfortable
22:25.720 - 22:32.420:  questions against the Hindu nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi and then they also cite the
22:32.420 - 22:38.220:  supreme courts comments which said that the judge in the lower court did not give a proper reason
22:38.220 - 22:44.700:  why he was disqualified for just to explain the case that in a campaign meeting in 2019 Mr Gandhi
22:45.320 - 22:51.180:  allegedly made some slur against this surname called Modi which is also the surname of the
22:51.180 - 22:56.760:  prime minister Narendra Modi so in a defamation case he was given a two-year jail sentence and
22:56.760 - 23:01.800:  that automatically disqualified parliament but then the supreme court has suspended the sentence and
23:01.800 - 23:07.240:  that is what made Mr Gandhi to come back and that has given a big boost to the congress party now
23:07.240 - 23:13.560:  they can say that Mr Gandhi will now raise all valid questions in parliament yeah it's quite a
23:13.560 - 23:19.920:  thing that the courts triumphed in the end but actually the main opposition leader went up against
23:19.920 - 23:25.880:  Narendra Modi and was sentenced to two years in prison that's that's quite scary that is why he was
23:25.880 - 23:31.740:  talking about how you know they were not being allowed to raise very valid issues people's issues
23:31.880 - 23:36.600:  issues concerning the country in parliament he was questioning you know what kind of democratic
23:36.600 - 23:42.780:  principles we have because if you look at the judgment by the supreme court the interim order
23:42.960 - 23:48.460:  which clearly states how come like from a lower court than another court than high court then it
23:48.460 - 23:53.460:  came to the supreme court does it have to come all the way to the supreme court which took only a
23:53.460 - 23:59.240:  couple of hours to say that no this this particular judgment does not valid and that is why the
23:59.240 - 24:05.460:  Mr Gandhi himself was questioning about how India's institutions which act as checks and balances
24:05.460 - 24:09.820:  in a democracy but compromised and bar asan et erasian
24:10.900 - 24:16.040:  a grieving mother and her lawyer say they've been targeted by a campaign of abuse after suing an
24:16.040 - 24:21.120:  Irish conspiracy theory newspaper which falsely claimed her son died after being given a
24:21.120 - 24:26.480:  covid vaccine deaths following the vaccines are extremely rare but conspiracy theorists worldwide
24:26.480 - 24:32.260:  have used unrelated deaths to spread misinformation our social media and disinformation
24:32.260 - 24:37.620:  correspondent Mariana spring reports Adele Campbell's 18-year-old son Diego took his
24:37.620 - 24:44.080:  own life in august 2021 over a year later she realised a conspiracy theory newspaper called the
24:44.080 - 24:49.500:  Irish light had included a photo of him in an article which suggested the covid vaccine was
24:49.500 - 24:55.340:  to blame for his death in fact the BBC has been told Diego had not been vaccinated when he died
24:55.820 - 25:00.400:  Adele Campbell and her solicitor Kiran Moore Holland are bringing a civil case against the paper
25:00.400 - 25:05.380:  and its editor Gemma Odochety for harassment with defamation a campaign of abuse followed
25:05.980 - 25:09.660:  Mr. More Holland said people who supported the Irish light called for him to be executed
25:10.480 - 25:14.780:  Miss Campbell said her life has been made hell Gemma Odochety and the Irish light have not
25:14.780 - 25:19.960:  responded to the BBC's request for comment however in online posts Miss Odochety denies
25:19.960 - 25:26.500:  harassing Adele Campbell and her legal team Mariana spring after decades of trying and failing
25:26.500 - 25:32.660:  scientists in California have been able to create the second ever successful nuclear fusion
25:32.660 - 25:37.780:  reaction when nuclear fusion was first achieved last December some thought it may have been a
25:37.780 - 25:43.200:  stroke of luck but this latest experiment could take us one step closer to the dream of abundant
25:43.200 - 25:49.780:  clean energy Alfie Haberson reports conventional nuclear power comes from fishing where atoms are
25:49.780 - 25:56.160:  split but this new process fusion is where atoms are smashed together it's the process that powers
25:56.160 - 26:01.780:  the sun and is capable of generating more power than it takes to produce it scientists have
26:01.780 - 26:07.740:  been on a quest to recreate nuclear fusion on earth since learning about it in the 1930s because
26:07.740 - 26:12.880:  it could generate almost four million times more energy per kilogram than burning oil or coal
26:13.480 - 26:18.740:  today it feels even more important in the battle against climate change offering the dream
26:18.740 - 26:24.300:  of limitless clean energy with a reaction that releases no greenhouse gases or radioactive waste
26:24.300 - 26:30.040:  byproducts scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US have now demonstrated
26:30.040 - 26:36.140:  nuclear fusion on a small scale for the second time this suggests the first demonstration by the
26:36.140 - 26:42.400:  California-based National Ignition Facility last December was not a fluke they fired giant lasers
26:42.400 - 26:49.180:  into a long-gold cylinder which created 50% more energy coming out than the lasers put in the US
26:49.180 - 26:54.640:  energy department called it a major scientific breakthrough that immense barriers stand in the way
26:54.640 - 27:00.000:  before we see nuclear fusion lighting our homes and offices on a small scale creating a
27:00.000 - 27:05.260:  nuclear fusion reaction is extremely expensive and the equipment involved still requires huge amounts
27:05.260 - 27:11.140:  of energy never mind the cost of powering a whole fusion power plant it's taken nearly a century
27:11.140 - 27:17.320:  to get this far and there's still a long way to go Alfie Haberson we've heard lots about the
27:17.320 - 27:22.540:  dangerous impacts that scorching heat waves are having on people around the world this summer but
27:22.540 - 27:28.380:  what about under the sea oceans have hit their highest temperature on record bringing new challenges
27:28.380 - 27:34.160:  to fish and other marine life Dr. Catherine Nongo is principal climate change scientist
27:34.160 - 27:40.960:  at the Marine Stewardship Council working on fish sustainability just like any other animals on
27:40.960 - 27:47.480:  earth fish have their range of temperatures and ocean conditions in which they thrive and then
27:47.540 - 27:54.620:  once the temperature goes above or below what they are used to they start suffering and so what happens
27:54.620 - 28:02.520:  when there is a sudden change which is a heat wave is that most fish will look for waters that are
28:02.520 - 28:08.880:  better suited to them and so what we might see is that they move suddenly and even fishermen might
28:08.880 - 28:13.700:  see that they're not fishing the same species anymore all of these different species are moving
28:13.700 - 28:20.220:  at the same time and so they are moving looking for food but also their prey items might be moving
28:20.220 - 28:26.000:  as well and so they might not be able to find it that might mean that they're not able to create
28:26.000 - 28:31.500:  these future generations and so in the US to come we see less and less of them climate change
28:31.500 - 28:38.160:  scientist Dr. Catherine Nongo the Philippines has accused China's coast guard of firing
28:38.160 - 28:43.520:  water cannon at its vessels in the disputed South China Sea Miller has described the actions
28:43.520 - 28:49.340:  as illegal and dangerous Philippine ships were delivering supplies to troops on the Spratley Islands
28:49.340 - 28:55.020:  which China claims as its territory I got more from that East Asia editor Jason Lee
28:55.700 - 29:00.260:  well essentially the Philippines is saying it will do all it can to protect the sovereignty
29:00.260 - 29:06.020:  in the South China Sea now the second Thomas Shaw which lies about 200 kilometers from the
29:06.020 - 29:10.960:  Philippines as part of the Spratley Islands you just mentioned and he's held by the Philippines but
29:10.960 - 29:16.020:  claimed by China as well earlier today we heard from the Philippine President Verde and Marcos
29:16.020 - 29:21.100:  saying that he summoned China's ambassadors to the Philippines and presented him with pictures and
29:21.100 - 29:26.640:  videos of the incident that took place on Saturday and in a press conference that ended a few hours
29:26.640 - 29:32.600:  ago Manila said that it will continue to file diplomatic protests to reaffirm its commitment
29:32.700 - 29:38.880:  to the second Thomas Shaw and made clear it will never abandon the show what's the view from China
29:39.460 - 29:44.860:  what China's coast guard which carried out this interception issued a statement regarding the
29:44.860 - 29:50.140:  condemnation from the Philippine military it said it took what it caused necessary controls
29:50.140 - 29:56.260:  against the Philippine boats that had illegally entered its waters it claims China now says it
29:56.260 - 30:01.620:  made temporary special arrangements for the Philippines to transport food and other necessities
30:01.940 - 30:06.340:  to the second Thomas Shaw where there are some of its troops stationed there but that Manila
30:06.340 - 30:12.140:  was bringing large quantities of construction materials Beijing deems as illegal to the show for
30:12.140 - 30:17.020:  some time now Beijing said it repeatedly expressed concerns to the Philippines through diplomatic
30:17.020 - 30:22.200:  channels over the situation on the shore and suggested the two sides hold talks over the situation
30:22.260 - 30:28.400:  but that Manila failed to respond to their suggestion and that on Saturday Philippines once again
30:28.400 - 30:32.820:  tried to deliver this construction material so they had no other choice than to intercept these
30:32.820 - 30:37.660:  two vessels carrying such materials now Beijing defends its position saying that the
30:37.660 - 30:42.460:  second Thomas Shaw is part of its territory and that China will continue to take necessary
30:42.460 - 30:47.820:  measures to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and urged Philippines actually to accept the
30:47.820 - 30:55.900:  proposal for bilateral talks Jay Sung Lee the motto of the international youth movement the scouts
30:55.900 - 31:03.100:  is be prepared but they weren't it's all gone horribly wrong for the organizers of the world's
31:03.100 - 31:09.760:  scout jamboree a two-week camp out for 40,000 teenagers from around the world in South Korea the
31:09.760 - 31:15.860:  events now ending early because of an incoming typhoon before that besides sweltering temperatures
31:15.860 - 31:21.840:  inadequate toilet facilities and a lack of food forcing children to go hungry led several
31:21.840 - 31:28.220:  countries to walk out the UK was one of them Matt Hyde is the chief executive of the UK scouts
31:28.660 - 31:33.560:  we felt that it was not a safe environment to be in and we knew when we took that decision
31:33.960 - 31:38.040:  how difficult that was going to be for young people who've spent two years raising money
31:39.000 - 31:43.420:  and that's why we feel so let down because we were put in an invidious position
31:43.920 - 31:49.580:  four and a half thousand British scouts had to be relocated into hotels in the capital soul
31:49.960 - 31:55.420:  our correspondent Jean McKenzie is there and told me more i think it's fair to say that it's not
31:55.420 - 32:00.540:  gone to plan i mean clearly a typhoon is an unfortunate which is the reason that's been given for
32:00.540 - 32:07.100:  pulling all the teenagers out of the site so 45,000 of them who are attending this event you know
32:07.100 - 32:11.720:  that's not something that can be avoided but yeah as you alluded to this has been beset by problems
32:11.720 - 32:15.960:  from the very start we were getting reports as early as they won that the conditions on the site
32:15.960 - 32:21.660:  were not good enough late on friday night was when the uk team decided that they were going to pull
32:21.660 - 32:27.260:  all of their team out they were the first ones to do so now part of the problem has been that
32:27.740 - 32:31.640:  it's just so hot here it's so hot and humid at the moment but it's not that
32:31.640 - 32:36.520:  atypical for this time of year in south korea the real issue is step in the fact that there was no
32:36.520 - 32:41.640:  shade on the site and very little provision given to deal with these very hot and humid temperatures
32:42.200 - 32:47.220:  alongside that you had concerns about the sanitation so when i spoke to the chief executive at the
32:47.220 - 32:51.340:  uk scouts earlier he was saying to me you know it's actually wasn't down to the heat it was because
32:51.340 - 32:55.520:  the toilets weren't clean enough the showers weren't clean enough there wasn't soap there weren't
32:55.560 - 33:00.860:  enough medical staff all these things came together essentially to create a site which they felt
33:00.860 - 33:05.620:  wasn't safe enough which is why they made that decision on friday others have followed them in
33:05.620 - 33:10.440:  pulling out but yeah clearly this decision to put everyone out the site today is a major one
33:10.640 - 33:15.460:  yeah we spoke a couple of days ago and i was impressed by it the way you told me just how enormous
33:15.460 - 33:21.560:  this site was this sea of tents almost as far as the i could see how on earth are they going to
33:21.560 - 33:29.040:  remove more than 40,000 young people and re-house them yeah i mean even this mission to get the four
33:29.040 - 33:33.340:  and a half thousand british scouts off the site over the weekend was a big one they had to get
33:33.340 - 33:38.140:  them in buses back to saw they had to find the hotel rooms for them which in a capital city in
33:38.140 - 33:42.380:  the middle of august is not the easiest thing to do so we think they're going to have to put on more
33:42.380 - 33:46.980:  than a thousand coaches tomorrow to try and get all the children out and they're going to be using
33:46.980 - 33:53.420:  public spaces so public halls schools gyms those sorts of things and there had been a big
33:53.680 - 33:58.080:  kpop concert that was planned for later in the week which they're going to have to look for indoor
33:58.080 - 34:03.440:  venues for because of course it doesn't necessarily mean that it's an end to the jamboree it just
34:03.440 - 34:08.580:  means it's an end to the camping so they still have to find all the activities for the kids to do
34:08.580 - 34:13.500:  and honestly this morning i think the uk team are feeling pretty pleased that they got out first
34:13.560 - 34:18.240:  they did get a bit of a stick that perhaps they'd overreacted or they'd been premature but they're
34:18.240 - 34:23.620:  the ones that got to saw first and have managed to hoover up all those hotel rooms but look it's
34:23.620 - 34:27.660:  cost the uk scouts more than a million pounds they told us today and that's going to come out of
34:27.660 - 34:32.600:  their reserves and probably impact the programs that they're able to do for the next three to five
34:32.600 - 34:37.620:  years so this will have ramifications for all these organisations. Gene McKenzie and soul
34:41.120 - 34:46.840:  and that's all from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the global news podcast later
34:46.840 - 34:52.420:  if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it you can send us an email
34:52.420 - 35:00.420:  the address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk you can also find us on twitter at global news pod
35:00.880 - 35:07.140:  this edition was mixed by chesney forks porter and the producers were febby hopson and anna murphy
35:07.560 - 35:12.040:  the editor is karen martin i'm Alex ritson until next time goodbye
