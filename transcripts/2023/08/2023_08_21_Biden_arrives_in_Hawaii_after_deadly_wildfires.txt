00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.540:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:19.420 - 00:24.240:  I'm Gareth Barlow, and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 22nd of August, these are our main
00:24.240 - 00:30.460:  stories. President Biden arrives at the Hawaiian island of Maui to see the devastation caused by a
00:30.460 - 00:36.220:  recent deadly wildfire. A political route has erupted in Spain over inappropriate celebrations
00:36.220 - 00:41.540:  at the Women's World Cup final, and the people of Ecuador have voted to end oil drilling in a
00:41.540 - 00:50.500:  protected area of the Amazon rainforest. Also in this podcast, although I'm 61, my heart is not
00:50.500 - 00:56.800:  necessarily 61, it came out with the answer of 63. Here how artificial intelligence is helping
00:56.800 - 01:06.360:  us to understand how old our hearts really are. Almost two weeks after Hawaii suffered its
01:06.360 - 01:11.640:  worst natural disaster in the state's history. President Biden has arrived there to meet survivors
01:11.640 - 01:16.320:  of the ferocious wildfires that ripped through the town of Lahaina on the island of Maui.
01:16.800 - 01:21.180:  He's been criticized for responding to slowly to the tragedy, which has claimed at least
01:21.180 - 01:27.160:  114 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes. More than a thousand people are still missing.
01:27.760 - 01:31.740:  The White House said that Mr. Biden delayed his trip so as not to distract from officials
01:31.740 - 01:36.380:  and rescue teams from their search, but a local paper said the president may not be assured
01:36.380 - 01:41.380:  of a warm welcome on Maui. Just before we recorded the podcast, I spoke to our North America
01:41.820 - 01:47.880:  Peter Boes. President Biden will need to answer questions directly about the speed of the
01:47.880 - 01:53.600:  federal government's response. Perhaps his personal response to this tragedy as well. He was on
01:53.600 - 01:58.720:  holiday at the time, but he was widely criticized for going several days without speaking about
01:58.720 - 02:05.480:  the tragedy. And despite promising help for everyone who needs it, some local people say the
02:05.480 - 02:11.940:  federal government's pledge on this has been inadequate and uncoordinated. And he will no doubt be
02:11.940 - 02:18.680:  asked about that. The federal emergency management agency has approved more than 5.6 million dollars
02:19.060 - 02:25.800:  in assistance. That's for 2,000 households on Maui and a one-time payment of 700 dollars per
02:25.800 - 02:30.380:  household. That's for clothing, food, transportation, a sum of money that's been
02:30.380 - 02:36.900:  derided by many people are simply not enough. On that basis, we're expecting President Biden to
02:36.900 - 02:42.180:  announce a further 3 million dollars in emergency funds. And I'm interested there's often lots of
02:42.180 - 02:46.400:  focus Peter in the immediate days and weeks with these disasters about how much money and support
02:46.400 - 02:50.860:  is available from the federal authorities. But do we expect that support to also be ongoing
02:50.860 - 02:55.200:  into the months and years to come? I think it is clearly about money and people will have
02:55.200 - 03:01.480:  questions about exactly that. But I think initially it is empathy and an understanding of their
03:01.480 - 03:08.060:  situation that people are looking for. A real practical understanding of the dire crisis that so many
03:08.060 - 03:13.600:  people are facing, the survivors, the loss of their homes, businesses and a real fear that their
03:13.600 - 03:19.960:  town, the devastated city of Lahaina, will never be the same again, even after its rebuilds,
03:20.060 - 03:24.340:  which will be a long time in the future. But there's real concern that its character will change
03:24.540 - 03:30.320:  and that developers will move in and change their way of life forever. And I think people are
03:30.320 - 03:35.520:  looking for a pledge that there will be local voices at the table when future big decisions
03:36.280 - 03:42.920:  are made. Native Hawaiians, I think, want these reassurances that outside corporations, for example,
03:42.920 - 03:48.960:  won't be allowed to come in and in effect squeeze out their local businesses. So it's more about
03:48.960 - 03:54.920:  money, it's about an understanding of their predicament. That was Peter Bose. The Spanish
03:54.920 - 04:00.760:  women's football team have arrived in Madrid as world champions following their 1-0 victory over
04:00.760 - 04:06.080:  England on Sunday. They've been parading the trophy through the streets of the capital, but now
04:06.080 - 04:11.540:  rowers are up in Spain, about one official that seemed to go too far as the team collected their
04:11.540 - 04:17.520:  medals back in Sydney. The Spanish F.A. present Luis Rubiales gripped the head of the star striker,
04:17.520 - 04:23.060:  Jenny Hermoso, and planted a big kiss directly on her lips. He since apologized, but many
04:23.060 - 04:28.640:  fans say it was deeply disrespectful as millions watched around the world. With more details,
04:28.640 - 04:34.380:  he is the football journalist Semra Hunter from Barcelona. It's been a huge storm and it's
04:34.380 - 04:39.860:  really gone at a lot of speed, a lot of pace and a lot of intensity. A lot of backlash has
04:39.860 - 04:46.440:  gone his way. I think people are very embarrassed quite frankly by the behavior of Luis Rubiales,
04:46.440 - 04:53.340:  who is the president of the federation. It really has sparked an outrage, I think, in general
04:53.340 - 04:59.240:  across the board, so much so that politicians have even gotten involved. Instead, we demand that he
04:59.240 - 05:04.800:  explains his behavior and we also demand an apology. There was no consent. She didn't consent to
05:04.800 - 05:10.860:  being kissed, and it's a boss kissing an employee. Not just that, but publicly, on the biggest stage.
05:11.520 - 05:17.380:  So yes, there was a huge amount of pressure for him to actually apologize, otherwise there was
05:18.100 - 05:21.940:  the thought that he would be pushed out of the job, that he would be forced to stand down,
05:21.940 - 05:25.620:  which obviously he doesn't want to do. A lot of people have been asking for him to be sat,
05:25.680 - 05:32.720:  hence why he twisted his arm in the end and came out with that my opinion, half-baked apology.
05:35.100 - 05:39.880:  There is something I regret. It was what happened between me and a player, with whom I have a
05:39.880 - 05:44.780:  fantastic relationship, just like with the others, where I have certainly made a mistake.
05:45.820 - 05:51.740:  I have to admit it, in that moment of absolute exaltation, without any bad intentions or bad
05:51.740 - 05:57.740:  faith, well, that happened. I think it a very spontaneous way. I repeat, without bad faith,
05:57.740 - 06:04.060:  we didn't understand the controversy because we saw it as something natural, normal, and as I said,
06:04.060 - 06:05.520:  with no bad faith at all.
06:07.700 - 06:12.820:  Jenny Armoso was speaking to one of her teammates. They were live on Instagram and the
06:12.820 - 06:19.020:  teammate said to her, what was that all about? And she said, well, I didn't like it,
06:19.440 - 06:23.000:  but the thing is, you can't really gauge her tone if she's kind of being serious or she's
06:23.000 - 06:28.320:  kind of joking about it. And then she said, well, what was I supposed to do? And then a second
06:28.320 - 06:33.400:  incident has come out on social media as well, where the president came down into the dressing room,
06:33.400 - 06:38.060:  standing next to Jenny Armoso, the player in question, and he says to the players, we're all
06:38.060 - 06:43.180:  going to Ibiza, Jenny and I are getting married. And it's like, what? The reason why he would say
06:43.180 - 06:48.860:  something like that is because sexism is so normalized in Spanish society. Matismo is still very
06:49.220 - 06:53.980:  much present, and women are still not treated with respect, they're not treated with equality,
06:53.980 - 06:58.180:  they're not treated with dignity, and generalizing here because it really has improved,
06:58.180 - 07:03.700:  but there's still a very, very long way to go, and this is just yet another example of that
07:03.700 - 07:10.040:  lack of awareness that doing insane certain things is absolutely fundamentally not okay.
07:10.900 - 07:15.680:  I feel Bali for Jenny Armoso that if she really wasn't comfortable with it, that she doesn't
07:15.680 - 07:20.060:  feel as though there are mechanisms in place by which she can actually speak the truth,
07:20.260 - 07:24.000:  and say, listen, actually, it wasn't okay with this. She really downplayed the whole thing,
07:24.220 - 07:28.380:  saying, oh, it's all good, it was just a gesture between two friends, we have great relationship,
07:28.380 - 07:33.900:  but it does speak to a much wider problem in Spanish society around sexism.
07:34.480 - 07:39.520:  The voice there of Semra Hunter. When the people of Ecuador voted in Sunday's
07:39.520 - 07:45.120:  presidential election, they also had to say over oil drilling in a protected area of the Amazon,
07:45.720 - 07:50.000:  and they voted to put an end to it. That decision means that the state-owned oil company
07:50.000 - 07:54.860:  will only have to stop its operations in a block of your Sunni National Park, one of the world's
07:54.860 - 08:00.580:  largest biodiversity hotspots. Our South American correspondent is Katie Watson, and in the Ecuador
08:00.580 - 08:06.880:  and capital Quito, she told us more. This is a culmination of years of demands for a referendum
08:06.880 - 08:11.800:  on all exploration. It's in an area called Yasuni National Park, and it's one of the most
08:11.840 - 08:18.280:  biodiverse places in the world, home to several contacted indigenous populations, so this has been
08:18.280 - 08:25.640:  a real fight by climate activists. So, in that sense, it's an absolute success. 59% of people
08:26.080 - 08:29.280:  said that they wanted to bring an end to exploring for oil in this area.
08:30.020 - 08:34.220:  You may be alluded to it there, who potentially can benefit from this. These uncontacted tribes,
08:34.220 - 08:37.820:  but then also there'll be a flip side. They will surely be an impact to the economy. So,
08:38.160 - 08:42.320:  how does this balance out? That's right. I mean, Guillermo and last other current president,
08:42.320 - 08:47.720:  he, his government has estimated, it will be a loss of around $16 billion over the next two decades.
08:47.820 - 08:52.480:  There are two ways of looking at it. Yes, it's a huge success for the, for a climate activist,
08:52.480 - 08:56.940:  for the Amazon, which, you know, there are experts saying that this is a, there's a concern that
08:56.940 - 09:00.980:  it could reach tipping point that there's too much exploration, too much degradation of forest,
09:01.140 - 09:05.660:  and there's no way back. At the same time, Ecuador is a country that, you know, is struggling
09:05.660 - 09:11.300:  economically, and, you know, it's the oils that it's biggest exports, so by not being able to explore,
09:11.300 - 09:15.560:  that will have an impact on the coffers here, and that's certainly been, you know, a concern
09:16.040 - 09:20.560:  Ecuadorians are needing better opportunities, better health and education,
09:21.220 - 09:24.660:  to try and combat some of the big problems that are going on here in Ecuador.
09:25.200 - 09:29.560:  And Katie, the big votes on Sunday's ballot paper was, of course, the presidential election.
09:29.620 - 09:34.440:  Are there any results yet from that? Yes, so, Luis Agonzalez left as Luis Agonzalez.
09:34.860 - 09:41.040:  She, she took the most votes around 33%, and she was then followed by Danielle Noboa,
09:41.060 - 09:46.500:  who's a businessman, and he took around 24% of the votes, so they'll be going through to a
09:46.500 - 09:53.760:  second round later in October. Katie Watson there. For almost every day last week, global indicators
09:53.760 - 09:59.600:  recorded Jakarta as the world's most polluted city. The Indonesian capital and the surrounding
09:59.600 - 10:06.440:  area form a megopolis, with a population of around 30 million people. Near Jakarta are clusters
10:06.440 - 10:11.680:  of factories and coal-fired power stations, and to this heavy traffic, which has then made the
10:11.680 - 10:17.380:  air quality so bad, that from today thousands of civil servants will work from home for the next two
10:17.380 - 10:22.140:  months. It's a pilot scheme, and how much of an effect can it really have? Our reporter,
10:22.140 - 10:26.500:  Astudestra Agenerastry, is in Jakarta, and tell me what it's like to live there.
10:26.860 - 10:34.460:  From last month is beginning to get really bad, so when you step outside, you can feel it
10:34.460 - 10:41.140:  immediately. When I go to the office, for example, I would thought that maybe it's cloudy,
10:41.140 - 10:48.520:  it's about to rain, but it's not. It's actually the pollution that makes the cloud so dark, and
10:49.120 - 10:56.120:  you cannot breathe easily. This is the start of the trial, and it's 25,000 or so civil servants who
10:56.120 - 11:01.980:  will be working from home. To what degree is there hope, if any, that this might have an impact
11:02.540 - 11:08.380:  on the pollution? Yeah, well, the government believe that working from home is one of the solution,
11:08.380 - 11:14.120:  the short-term solution, and even though we cannot see it directly, because this is still the
11:14.120 - 11:21.980:  first day of the trial, the government seems very optimistic about the solution, and it still draws
11:21.980 - 11:29.900:  many critics, especially from the environmentalist, and also from other Jakarta citizens.
11:29.980 - 11:37.460:  So a lot of the critics say that it will not affect as much as to pollution, but it will definitely
11:37.460 - 11:45.360:  affect to the traffic jam that, of course, Jakarta is known for. And that leads us nicely into
11:45.360 - 11:50.420:  the source of the pollution, because climate campaigners say that it's a high number of factories
11:50.420 - 11:55.580:  and coal-fired power stations near Jakarta that are pumping out pollution. The government says,
11:55.580 - 12:01.660:  like you alluded to, it's the traffic and it's the weather. What is the reality? Where is all of
12:01.660 - 12:06.820:  this air pollution coming from? Right, so the Ministry of Environment and Forestry say that
12:06.820 - 12:14.540:  transportation is the main source of air pollution, which is 44% according to their research,
12:15.160 - 12:25.320:  and then it's followed by industry about 31%, manufacturing 10%, housing 14%, and commercial 1%.
12:26.120 - 12:32.680:  They also blame the pollution spike because of the dry season, and indeed Jakarta hasn't seen
12:32.680 - 12:40.100:  rains for almost three months, and it is believed that is why the pollutants are still floating
12:40.100 - 12:48.960:  in the air, but it's true. A lot of the environmentalists agree that the coal emissions from the power
12:48.960 - 12:56.160:  plant is actually the biggest culprits of this pollution. The government will, they don't really
12:56.160 - 13:02.800:  dismiss it, because President Joko Widodo, in the emergency cabinet meeting, also mentioned
13:02.800 - 13:11.140:  something about the power plants in Jakarta and its surrounding, but it is included in the long-term
13:11.140 - 13:17.560:  plan to deal with the pollution. That was Asterdestra Agingrastery speaking to me from Jakarta.
13:18.480 - 13:21.500:  The police in London have been investigating thefts of gold,
13:21.500 - 13:27.380:  jury, and gems at the British Museum since the start of the year. Officers also requested that the
13:27.380 - 13:32.320:  case should not be revealed to the public while it carried out its inquiries. One member of the
13:32.320 - 13:37.280:  staff has been sacked, some of the stolen items were later found for sale on eBay. Meanwhile,
13:37.280 - 13:42.360:  the story has led to renewed causing grease for the return of the Algon Marbles, as a culture
13:42.360 - 13:51.360:  editor Katie Razor reports. Greek TV this weekend, dominated by the thefts from the British Museum.
13:54.060 - 13:59.560:  The Greek culture minister told the BBC it raises questions about the safety and integrity of
13:59.560 - 14:04.740:  all the museum's exhibits, and she means the Parthenon sculptures or Algon Marbles.
14:05.240 - 14:10.320:  If the museum can't look after other items in the collection, suggest the Greeks it reinforces
14:10.320 - 14:15.400:  their country's demand for the return of the classical sculptures to Athens. We still don't know
14:15.400 - 14:20.640:  what's gone missing from the museum's store room, how many items are involved, or what's been sold
14:20.640 - 14:26.340:  online. But I understand the police were contacted in January by the museum and have since been
14:26.340 - 14:32.020:  investigating the disappearances which date back over several years. The museum has dismissed
14:32.020 - 14:38.340:  a member of staff. He's been named as Dr Peter Higgs, a senior curator in charge of Greek
14:38.360 - 14:43.540:  collections. The BBC haven't been able to speak to him. His son has denied his father's done
14:43.540 - 14:49.500:  anything wrong and says it isn't fair. The items are believed to include jewelry acquired in the
14:49.500 - 14:55.360:  early 19th century amongst this collection from Charles Townley, a buyer of antiquities. One
14:55.360 - 15:02.500:  expert in recovering stolen items says speed is essential. It is so important to have everything
15:02.500 - 15:08.940:  documented at this early stage because we know things are being sold on eBay. We know things have
15:08.940 - 15:15.620:  already been sold on eBay. How do we get those objects back? We just can't wait for a police
15:15.620 - 15:22.220:  investigation to be completed. I understand Scotland Yard has asked the museum not to disclose
15:22.220 - 15:26.820:  further details of what's missing at this point. However, in the coming days or weeks,
15:26.820 - 15:32.320:  the BBC expects the museum will report the losses to Interpol, then it's likely we will
15:32.320 - 15:35.720:  know what treasures are gone. That report by Katie Razzle.
15:38.540 - 15:43.780:  Still to come in the podcast? We don't have enough money to afford to go home every day.
15:43.920 - 15:48.100:  We can't afford the transport cost. We want a government that knows how to treat its people
15:48.100 - 15:52.340:  properly. We hear from the people in Zimbabwe as they head to the polls.
16:00.040 - 16:05.940:  Last year between July and October, at least 70 children, younger than five, died in the
16:05.940 - 16:11.600:  Gambier in West Africa of acute kidney injuries after consuming cough syrups made in India.
16:12.220 - 16:16.900:  In October, the World Health Organization linked the deaths to the syrups, saying it found
16:16.900 - 16:22.920:  unacceptable levels of toxins in the medicines. A year later, some of the parents in the Gambier
16:22.920 - 16:27.560:  are suing local health officials and the pharmaceutical company over alleged negligence.
16:27.940 - 16:32.700:  Vinic Carey from BBC Hindi explained to LaQuesta Barak what has happened after the children's
16:32.700 - 16:38.120:  deaths. Initially, there was a confusion as to what is really killing the children, but then
16:38.120 - 16:45.240:  you had lab tests and reports came out and India made cough syrups allegedly contaminated
16:45.260 - 16:53.120:  with ethylene glycol and diethlene glycol were blamed. You also had the World Health Organization
16:53.120 - 17:00.260:  saying that India made cough syrups could be potentially linked to the death and the Indian
17:00.260 - 17:06.440:  company in the center of it all denied the Indian government said that they had tested the samples
17:06.440 - 17:12.220:  here in India. Nothing came out of it, but it's been one year since the start of the deaths,
17:12.220 - 17:17.840:  the beginning of the deaths in the Gambier and the families there are demanding justice.
17:17.840 - 17:25.320:  They have approached the high court in the Gambier and sued the Indian company and the local authorities
17:25.320 - 17:31.180:  and I went there. They said that they would not hesitate to approach the Indian courts and the
17:31.180 - 17:35.160:  international courts. So they are looking for justice, they're demanding justice, they're blaming,
17:35.160 - 17:41.600:  of course, the frail internal health system within the Gambier, but they're also demanding
17:41.600 - 17:47.320:  justice from the Indian government and they want the culprits to be punished so that these deaths,
17:47.320 - 17:54.540:  these cases are never repeated. Just going back to these exact toxins. So I mean it's important
17:54.540 - 18:01.720:  that we stress that last year the WHO did say and they linked the deaths to the syrups. They said
18:02.500 - 18:07.880:  that they had found unacceptable levels of toxins in the medicines you described to
18:07.880 - 18:15.520:  of those. Just explain to the toxicity. There is a story or you've spoken to one African family
18:15.520 - 18:20.940:  I know we have the story on the website. What exactly does it do to the body? Why are they toxic?
18:21.300 - 18:29.480:  So these are toxic when they're ingested. They damage the kidneys and could lead to multi-organ
18:29.480 - 18:37.580:  failure. So especially if the victim or if the if if it's a child who is consuming these
18:37.580 - 18:43.140:  toxins, it could really be fatal. And as you mentioned, I spoke to families there and one of the
18:43.140 - 18:51.760:  families the father's name was Ebrima Sanya and his three-year-old child Lamin in September last
18:51.760 - 18:58.820:  year. He fell ill, he had fever, the family took him to a doctor, the doctor prescribed medication
18:58.820 - 19:05.520:  which included this stuff syrup. And the child wasn't some for some reason, wasn't keen on consuming
19:05.520 - 19:11.980:  the syrup but Ebrima told me that he forced Lamin, his three-year-old son to consume the syrup
19:11.980 - 19:17.380:  and this is a moment he will never forget how it all happened and he said that he regretted
19:17.380 - 19:24.940:  forcing Lamin to consume the syrup and within seven days of consuming that that toxin Lamin
19:24.940 - 19:35.200:  died. So initially his food intake reduced his urine output reduced and the doctors when Lamin
19:35.200 - 19:40.700:  was taken to a doctor, the doctor told him the family that he had kidney shoes and as I said the
19:40.700 - 19:48.100:  child died within seven days. And this is the same story that you'd hear from other families as well
19:48.660 - 19:55.560:  to see your child die in front of your eyes. You can imagine the pain these families suffered and
19:55.560 - 20:00.700:  these are all children who could not even express to their parents, to their relatives, to anyone
20:00.700 - 20:06.700:  around them as to what they were experiencing inside their bodies, young from two months old,
20:06.700 - 20:13.040:  to five-year-old children and the way they died, the way they suffered, it was it was harrowing
20:13.780 - 20:18.720:  for these families and that is why they are demanding justice from the Indian government and
20:18.720 - 20:23.220:  from the Gambian government as well. Well for their part, both maiden pharmacy schools and the
20:23.220 - 20:27.920:  Indian government have denied that the deaths were the result of the children ingesting the syrups,
20:28.360 - 20:33.000:  the health minister of the Gambia did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview.
20:34.260 - 20:39.240:  Symphabians will go to the polls on Tuesday but there are growing allegations of repression which
20:39.240 - 20:44.980:  is casting down on the credibility of the presidential election. The vote pits the incumbent and
20:44.980 - 20:50.200:  Zhanu P.F. party leader Emerson Emengagwa against the opposition leader in the form of Nelson Chimesa.
20:50.740 - 20:56.120:  Emengagna won a disputed election back in 2018 but has struggled to tame the country's economic
20:56.460 - 21:02.780:  problems, including over 100% inflation. Our correspondent in Zimbabwe, Shinganyaka has been looking
21:02.780 - 21:08.680:  at the issue's affecting voters. It's the crack of dawn and hoppy south of Hararet and one family
21:08.680 - 21:14.260:  is heading out to one of the streets. Yaraichi Johnway and her young sons are searching for discarded
21:14.260 - 21:24.020:  rubbish to sell. We started collecting plastic bottles last year when my husband lost his job.
21:25.040 - 21:31.340:  We're looking for something to do to make a living, to survive. It is not paying that much.
21:31.760 - 21:35.820:  I've tried to find manor work so that I can work for my children.
21:40.540 - 21:45.620:  Her oldest son, 14-year-old Tinashe, jumps into the rubbish skip. He's tired and frustrated.
21:49.480 - 21:52.240:  It hurts because my friends are going to school and I am not.
21:57.820 - 22:03.460:  Their precarious existence reflects Zimbabwe's decades-old economic problems, including company
22:03.460 - 22:08.180:  closures. Hawkers now fill the streets, selling anything they can.
22:11.340 - 22:17.040:  Only one in 4 Zimbabweans has formal regulated work, but even some of those with full-time jobs
22:17.040 - 22:24.360:  are struggling. In a city park, I met a security guard who works for a large firm. He earns 50
22:24.360 - 22:29.480:  U.S. dollars a month and sleeps here between his night shifts. He didn't want to be identified.
22:30.540 - 22:35.540:  We don't have enough money to afford to go home every day. We can't afford the transport cost.
22:35.700 - 22:39.380:  We want a government that knows how to treat its people properly. People are suffering.
22:42.180 - 22:45.920:  The high cost of living and the lack of opportunities top the lists of concerns
22:45.920 - 22:51.840:  as millions of Zimbabweans go to the polls and their skepticism about what these elections will do
22:51.840 - 22:59.180:  for the country. I'm not excited at all. Why? I think nothing changes. Nothing changes.
23:02.060 - 23:06.720:  Past elections haven't changed anything. I do not have interest in them.
23:11.000 - 23:14.980:  Leaders must fulfill their promises so that things can happen.
23:23.520 - 23:27.380:  Nelson Chamisa leads the opposition party the citizens coalition for change,
23:28.060 - 23:31.780:  enthusiastic supporters believe he will restore jobs and the rule of law,
23:31.780 - 23:37.140:  but the ghost of past elections lingers, mass arrests, violence and intimidation,
23:37.140 - 23:43.720:  banned rallies and allegations of vote manipulation. Chamisa fears voters could be disenfranchised.
23:47.580 - 23:52.320:  President Menangagua is seeking a second-term in office. He rejects the accusations of vote
23:52.320 - 23:58.480:  manipulation. No one should come and tell us our elections are free, fair and transparent.
23:58.540 - 24:08.400:  Nonsense! He is us who want free, fair and transparent elections for ourselves,
24:08.400 - 24:13.340:  not for anybody else. He says he's brought infrastructural development, new roads,
24:13.340 - 24:18.860:  energy projects and a mining and agricultural boom, but many say the benefits are yet to be
24:18.860 - 24:24.540:  felt on the ground. Back in Hoppley, Nyorai has sold her plastic bottles and she's holding wards
24:24.540 - 24:30.080:  of 100 local dollar notes worth about 50 cents, enough to buy vegetables for the day she says.
24:33.160 - 24:38.020:  But at last her children can eat. She refused to talk about the elections and the
24:38.020 - 24:42.920:  impact of Zimbabwe's politics and their lives as her family prepares to turn in for the night.
24:43.440 - 24:48.520:  Nyorai is unsure what the new day will bring and whether she'll be able to put food on the table.
24:50.020 - 24:56.980:  That was Shingai Nyorka in Harari. After weeks of speculation, the British football team
24:56.980 - 25:01.200:  Manchester United have agreed with one of its most promising players Mason Greenwood
25:01.580 - 25:05.760:  that he will leave the Premier League club following its investigation into his personal life.
25:06.360 - 25:10.440:  Last year, the 21-year-old, who was also paid for England, was accused of attempted
25:10.440 - 25:15.800:  rape and assault, but the charges were later dropped. As soon as the allegations surfaced online,
25:15.800 - 25:19.320:  Mason Greenwood was suspended from playing or training with Mangu.
25:19.800 - 25:24.300:  The club has concluded that he didn't commit any defences with which he was charged and he
25:24.300 - 25:29.040:  denies any wrongdoing. Natalie Burrell, who is from an independent Mangu supporters group,
25:29.040 - 25:33.440:  welcomed the decision. What should have happened from the start? I'm glad it's happened now.
25:33.880 - 25:37.200:  I feel like they're listening to the voices of women listening to the voices not just
25:37.200 - 25:42.440:  of Manchester United, women, the fans, the players, but listening to the voices of all women
25:42.440 - 25:46.820:  across the world. With more details, here's our sports correspondent, Oli Foster.
25:47.280 - 25:51.640:  They're under a lot of pressure, Manchester United, to come to a decision that hoped to
25:52.060 - 25:57.040:  achieve that before the start of the season. Just go back to last week in the opening round of
25:57.040 - 26:02.300:  fixtures. There were protests at Old Trafford because there was every indication that Manchester
26:02.300 - 26:08.740:  United were going to reintegrate Mason Greenwood into their squad, but various female fans groups
26:08.740 - 26:14.880:  were strongly opposed to that and protested, so there was no announcement last week.
26:14.880 - 26:20.420:  Now we've had this lengthy statement of which Manchester United have talked about how they've
26:20.420 - 26:25.640:  gone about this fact-finding mission for the last seven months since the Crown Prosecution Service
26:25.640 - 26:31.860:  dropped all charges of attempted rape, coercive and controlling behaviour, and also assault
26:32.320 - 26:37.160:  against Mason Greenwood. They've said that they've had to keep a lot of it confidential to
26:37.160 - 26:43.800:  protect the continuing anonymity of the alleged victim relating to those charges.
26:44.180 - 26:50.940:  One female fans group has come out on social media. The female fans against Mason Greenwood's
26:50.940 - 26:55.760:  return, they called themselves, MUFC leadership have finally done the right thing they say for the
26:55.760 - 27:02.260:  wrong reasons to save their own next to avoid the PR disaster. Not out of care for any of us,
27:02.260 - 27:08.940:  they have lied, backtracked and ignored us until they feared for their own reputation.
27:09.120 - 27:14.460:  Certainly, there will be relief among those fans groups that a decision has been made,
27:14.460 - 27:19.100:  but the process has dragged on for an awful long time, especially when they feared that
27:19.100 - 27:23.840:  Mason Greenwood would be reintegrated into the squad. But now we have this mutual agreement
27:23.840 - 27:30.840:  between all parties that he will continue his football career elsewhere. He still has two years
27:30.840 - 27:37.860:  left on his contract. It only expires in 2025, so the option will be for Manchester United to
27:37.860 - 27:44.440:  loan Mason Greenwood out or to sell him. We've still got another week or so left in the transfer
27:44.440 - 27:51.760:  window, so that's the time frame that we are dealing with. That was Oli Foster. A new artificial
27:51.760 - 27:57.640:  intelligence tool can reveal how much your heart may have prematurely aged because of a lack of
27:57.640 - 28:02.980:  exercise, poor diet, drinking or smoking. It's hoped its development will help find ways to
28:02.980 - 28:08.040:  reduce the risks of many age-related conditions, such as strokes. Our science correspondent,
28:08.040 - 28:12.260:  Palab Goesh, had his heart assessed by the new tool. I asked him how it went.
28:12.980 - 28:18.360:  It was an MRI scan, something that lots of people go through. In this case, it was looking at
28:18.420 - 28:23.040:  my beating heart and the blood vessels around it. So that's a perfectly normal thing to do.
28:23.040 - 28:28.560:  The imaginative thing that's happened is that the doctors have used artificial intelligence to
28:28.560 - 28:35.240:  compare my heart with the hearts of 5,000 completely healthy individuals of varying ages.
28:36.000 - 28:42.000:  And the AI system can see things that even the most expert cardiologists can't. So it can
28:42.000 - 28:49.940:  match the closest heart to my heart from a healthy person. Although I'm 61, my heart is not
28:49.940 - 28:56.220:  necessarily 61, because it depends on the lifestyle I've led. If I'd led a virtuous life,
28:56.220 - 29:01.780:  it would have been younger, but sadly I haven't. So it was a little bit older. It came out with the
29:01.780 - 29:06.800:  answer of 63. I'm thinking that if you go to the gym picking up on that virtuous lifestyle,
29:06.860 - 29:12.220:  there are many machines that report to give you many of the stats about your body and some of
29:12.220 - 29:17.840:  them might say your heart health. So we've been tinkering with these kind of predictions in the past.
29:17.840 - 29:21.900:  What is AI adding to this? What is it doing that we've not been able to do before?
29:22.380 - 29:28.080:  Well, it's doing what we've done before more accurately. If you google how it is my heart,
29:28.080 - 29:34.320:  you can be sent to lots of websites where you put in your risk factors. So your blood pressure,
29:34.320 - 29:38.260:  if you know it, whether you smoke and how much you smoke, the amount of exercise you do,
29:38.660 - 29:44.320:  but that's no substitute for actually having a look inside your own heart and comparing it with
29:44.320 - 29:49.600:  other people. And this research takes it a stage further. What the researchers did was looked at
29:49.600 - 29:55.800:  the people who had prematurely aged hearts and found out about their genes and their activities
29:55.900 - 30:02.500:  and for those who had hearts that were younger than they should be. We know that exercise is good
30:02.500 - 30:06.880:  for you. We know that certain medication is good for you and diets are good for you. But it's about
30:07.120 - 30:13.320:  teasing out the precise mechanisms that enable some people to lead quite unhealthy lifestyles,
30:13.980 - 30:19.640:  nothing seems to show. And vice versa. So by understanding the genetic mechanisms, you can maybe
30:19.640 - 30:25.260:  develop medications and other interventions that might have a big difference for those who,
30:25.740 - 30:31.020:  through no fall to their own, have premature aging, maybe because of their genes. I'm a South Asian,
30:31.020 - 30:37.740:  my origins are South Asian. So I'm more prone to diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiac diseases.
30:37.740 - 30:44.160:  So I start off at a disadvantage. So I was actually relieved that my heart age was only two
30:44.160 - 30:49.300:  years older than my actual age. It could have been so much worse. So this technology very much has
30:49.300 - 30:54.940:  the capacity, the potential to reach everybody. It does quite often these big breakthroughs are so
30:54.940 - 31:01.440:  expensive and so far away that you will not hear of it for a long, long time. Even though I undertook
31:01.440 - 31:06.420:  an MRI scan, which is expensive, it's quite possible to do the same with much cheaper
31:07.200 - 31:12.500:  ECGs that monitor the electrical activity, which aren't necessarily that cheap but much cheaper
31:12.500 - 31:18.220:  than MRIs. So it is something that isn't miles away and it's something that doesn't cost a million
31:18.220 - 31:26.100:  dollars. The BBC's Palabgosh. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of
