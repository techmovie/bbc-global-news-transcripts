00:18.840 - 00:23.980:  everyone knows he has an Olympic champion on the plane. On the podium is back with more Olympians
00:23.980 - 00:30.360:  and Paralympians sharing their remarkable stories. On the podium, listen now wherever you get your
00:30.360 - 00:38.000:  BBC podcasts. Hey y'all, I'm Kentucky Gallyu. I'm in San Diego, California and me and my dog
00:38.000 - 00:44.740:  Derby are happy to be on the happy pod. Hello, I'm Ross. I'm in South Africa and this is the happy pod.
00:45.320 - 00:52.600:  Hello, my name is Barry Boy and I am on a recycling mission. You are listening to BBC's
00:52.700 - 00:58.380:  happy pod. Ready? Let's get on then. This is the happy pod from the BBC World Service.
01:03.640 - 01:08.760:  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 12th of August from Syria.
01:09.080 - 01:15.080:  People called it a miracle was a moment of hope amid a devastating moment for two nations.
01:15.080 - 01:20.140:  Six months on, we catch up with the baby born beneath the rubble of a devastating earthquake.
01:20.300 - 01:24.440:  The teenager who has made it his mission to get people to recycle their batteries.
01:25.040 - 01:28.780:  Also the discovery that rats like and laugh as much as the next person.
01:29.100 - 01:33.820:  The rats need to get to know the experimenter and then you can tickle them and they will
01:33.820 - 01:38.620:  meet these giggler sounds. A new world record for a martial artist in India
01:38.620 - 01:42.280:  and the mum and daughter from Antigua who won a trip to space.
01:42.780 - 01:49.640:  He felt like a part of the team, a part of the chef, a part of the universe that was incredible.
01:55.080 - 02:00.620:  Now to check back in on a little moment of hope that emerged from the rubble of a disaster.
02:01.160 - 02:05.100:  The earthquake that devastated so much of Turkey and Syria in February.
02:05.840 - 02:09.280:  You might remember it. This was from a report at the time by Lee's duet,
02:09.280 - 02:16.680:  our chief international correspondent. And then this moment, a newborn baby pulled from the ruins.
02:17.660 - 02:21.960:  Even more, her umbilical cord had to be cut from her mother.
02:22.520 - 02:26.760:  That little girl was initially called Aya by medical staff, meaning miracle,
02:26.760 - 02:30.820:  but her surviving family now call her Afra after her mother.
02:31.500 - 02:35.700:  She's now six months old and Halan Rasek, a BBC Arabic, told us about her,
02:36.120 - 02:37.820:  starting with her dramatic rescue.
02:38.600 - 02:44.800:  Her family was at home when the earthquake hit, but Afra was born under the rubble of her family
02:44.800 - 02:49.100:  home. All her family was killed, but when people were running around,
02:49.100 - 02:56.380:  her uncle, her crying of a baby, and he started looking, then he found Afra with her
02:56.380 - 03:01.360:  umbilical cord still attached to her mother's body, so he rescued her.
03:01.800 - 03:11.340:  And after she was found amid all this destruction, people really latched on to this tiny point of
03:11.480 - 03:15.020:  joy. Tell us a bit more about the response to her rescue.
03:15.260 - 03:21.460:  I was there in Turkey back then, and the damage was something that I'd never seen before in
03:21.460 - 03:28.420:  other earthquakes or even war zones. So it was absolutely astonishing when the video of the
03:28.420 - 03:35.580:  rescue of baby Afra started to circulate, it managed to captivate the whole world of this very
03:35.580 - 03:42.500:  happy joyful story. People called it a miracle, was a moment of hope amid a devastating moment
03:42.500 - 03:49.880:  for two nations, and then the proposals to adopt her started to flood in from all over the world,
03:49.920 - 03:55.520:  and then the uncle also told us that they were offered to go and live abroad, but they decided
03:55.520 - 04:00.320:  to stay in Syria. And why did they decide that? Because it must have been pretty tempting to leave
04:00.320 - 04:06.220:  at that point. They told us they think it's better to stay there even though they lost many of
04:06.220 - 04:12.760:  their family members, but they are still attached to this part of Syria. It's their home and they
04:12.760 - 04:18.960:  don't want to leave it. So now little Afra is six months old and she lives with her aunt, her uncle,
04:18.960 - 04:25.840:  and seven cousins. How is she doing? She seems very happy. Her pictures, her videos are amazing.
04:25.840 - 04:30.240:  She seems absolutely fine. Her uncle actually told us that in the beginning,
04:30.240 - 04:36.680:  her body was understandably full of bruises everywhere. She had a chest infection because of
04:36.680 - 04:42.000:  the rubble and all the dust she inhaled as soon as she was born, but he said six months on
04:42.000 - 04:49.080:  her health state is 100%. You can see her pictures smiling and she seems like a perfectly
04:49.080 - 04:55.460:  healthy, happy baby. The uncle told us that he kept some pictures of her family to show her when
04:55.460 - 05:01.040:  she's older and he said for him, she is one of his children. The pictures really are lovely.
05:01.100 - 05:07.140:  She has an incredibly sweet little smile. Obviously, her arrival in the world coincided with
05:07.820 - 05:14.520:  destruction and loss and trauma, but people do feel hope because of her. So what is the future,
05:14.520 - 05:21.060:  Holdra? At the moment, the road ahead seems to be difficult because the family lived in a camp
05:21.060 - 05:26.280:  tent for a couple of months now. They are renting a house, but because of the economic situation,
05:26.280 - 05:31.300:  they find it more and more expensive, but they are actually, and these are the words,
05:31.640 - 05:37.960:  they are grateful for the chance they have, and they think Afra maybe brought them a new
05:37.960 - 05:43.140:  perspective to life, a new start to life, and they are just waiting to see what's going to happen.
05:43.140 - 05:49.920:  But the uncle said he hopes that there is some light on the Syrians people, especially those living
05:49.920 - 05:55.480:  in the northwestern part of the country. And just finally, Hannah, we mentioned the seven cousins,
05:55.480 - 06:01.480:  one of whom is actually the same age as Afra. So what do all the cousins say about her?
06:01.800 - 06:07.880:  For them, she's a sister. She is named after her mother. They say she reminds them a lot of her
06:07.880 - 06:14.060:  mother and father. The other baby, the other cousin was born three days after Afra was also named
06:14.060 - 06:19.420:  after another aunt who died in the earthquake. And I think for the family, those two babies,
06:19.900 - 06:25.420:  they bring a lot of hope. And when you look at the pictures, they seem to be quite happy, happy kids.
06:26.180 - 06:32.340:  Hannah and Rudek are BBC Arabic. Now it's something that only a very few people have experienced,
06:32.340 - 06:40.140:  floating in zero gravity and gazing out of a spaceship window to wonder at views of the earth
06:40.360 - 06:45.800:  and the black of space. And now a mother and daughter from Antigua who won their tickets in a lottery
06:45.800 - 06:51.000:  and an 80-year-old British man with Parkinson's disease have joined that select group.
06:51.000 - 06:55.460:  They were the first members of the public to go into space on a virgin galactic flight.
06:56.140 - 07:01.100:  The flight lasted just over an hour before returning safely to Earth. Sophie Long was watching
07:01.100 - 07:08.920:  from the spaceport in New Mexico. Feeling great! John Goodwin and mother and daughter duo Keisha
07:08.920 - 07:15.500:  Hafen Animiers make their way to the spaceship unity. Then at 8.30 local time,
07:15.500 - 07:22.440:  liftoff, on schedule and in perfect conditions. This is the moment John Goodwin has been waiting for
07:22.440 - 07:29.280:  a quarter of his life. He is now on his way to space on Virgin Galactic's first private passenger
07:29.280 - 07:34.980:  flight. Three, two, one, release, release, release. And this is what it's all about. As the
07:34.980 - 07:40.980:  spaceship unity hit Apigee, more than 50 miles above the Earth's surface. Congratulations to John,
07:40.980 - 07:46.660:  to Keisha, to Anna on becoming astronauts today and a special congratulations to our unity pilot
07:46.660 - 07:52.420:  Kelly for her first space flight. Three minutes of weightlessness and views of our planet that only
07:52.420 - 07:59.240:  astronauts have ever experienced. You are so much more connected to everything than you would expect to
08:00.220 - 08:06.960:  be. You felt like a part of the team, a part of the ship, a part of the universe, a part of Earth.
08:06.960 - 08:12.980:  It was incredible. Safely back on Earth, John told me his experience was better than he ever
08:12.980 - 08:22.980:  imagined it would be. Looking at Earth from space, the curvature of the Earth, the brightness of
08:22.980 - 08:34.100:  the space, the pure clarity was amazing. In 2014 you got diagnosed with Parkinson's. Three years
08:34.100 - 08:42.120:  ago you went up Keila Manjaro. Today you went to space. How are you going to top this? What's next
08:42.220 - 08:49.560:  for John Goodwin? The great thing of waiting 18 years was it wasn't a problem. I got something
08:50.120 - 08:57.000:  to look forward to, which was very few other people had done and that has now happened. I
08:57.000 - 09:03.200:  suppose I've got to go to the moon. Astronaut John Goodwin ending that report by Safely Long in New
09:03.200 - 09:09.620:  Mexico. Michael Breckner's a neuroscientist at Humboldt University in Berlin doesn't think we
09:09.620 - 09:15.840:  know enough about fun, play and the parts of the brain responsible for laughter. So he has made
09:15.840 - 09:22.820:  it his work to find out more and that involves tickling rats. We understood for a while already
09:22.820 - 09:28.840:  that ticklishness and playfulness belong very much together in rats. So we used this connection
09:28.840 - 09:34.920:  to look for a center for playfulness in the red brain. And did you find it? Yes, we looked at a
09:34.920 - 09:41.500:  mid-brain structure, PhD, and this is a place where we indeed found indications of playfulness.
09:41.980 - 09:46.660:  We then, while playing and tickling the rats, we measure the activity of single neurons,
09:46.800 - 09:51.940:  but the rats need to get to know the experimenter and then you can tickle them and they will
09:51.940 - 09:58.160:  meet these giggle sounds, these ultrasonic vocalizations when you're touched them. Laughter isn't
09:58.160 - 10:03.160:  necessarily indicative of what we think of as a sense of humor of finding things funny.
10:03.920 - 10:09.480:  How can you tell? In humans, I think it's debated if ticklishness and humorous laughter are one
10:09.480 - 10:14.860:  in the same thing. In the rats, I would say it's 100 percent the same thing. And amazingly enough,
10:14.860 - 10:20.100:  they are also quite non ticklish rats. You work with them for a while, they just don't enjoy it
10:20.100 - 10:24.700:  all that much and you bet they will not play with you. So where does your research go next?
10:24.760 - 10:30.060:  There's many things that we do not understand. For example, the young red pubs we work with,
10:30.100 - 10:35.040:  they play night and day and you can see the mother rat, she's unable to sleep because their
10:35.040 - 10:40.560:  young pubs are so playful. And it's a good older, they lose most of their playfulness and we
10:40.560 - 10:45.600:  obviously think it ought to be changed in the brain, but we don't know what it is. Another thing
10:45.600 - 10:50.720:  that we would like to know or they're clear to us, some animals are very playful, others not,
10:50.720 - 10:56.140:  like monkeys, incredibly playful. My very non playful animal, we would want to know,
10:56.140 - 11:00.420:  just that relate to differences in this structure. Do you enjoy your work, Michael?
11:00.900 - 11:05.920:  Absolutely, I think this is a fun thing to start in this fest and eating babies, like we had this
11:06.240 - 11:11.340:  paradigm where we play hide and seek with rats, they are very strategic, very impressive,
11:11.340 - 11:16.340:  hide and seek players. I've never seen that do anything quite as complex as this hide and seek
11:16.340 - 11:22.700:  games that we did to them. Neuroscientist Michael Brettner's in Berlin. Now we do love a world record
11:22.700 - 11:28.660:  in the happy news team and 27-year-old martial artist Naveen Kumar has just reclaimed one
11:28.660 - 11:36.600:  for cracking the most wool nuts in one minute with his head. His total 273, that's over four and a
11:36.600 - 11:44.020:  half nuts per second. By doing so, he broke the previous record of 254 taking the title from
11:44.020 - 11:48.880:  serial record breaker Muhammad Rashid. Lippaker Pellum takes up the story.
11:49.620 - 11:55.420:  Indians have a deep enthusiasm for record setting, which in recent years has developed into
11:55.420 - 12:02.620:  something of an obsession. Hence, the long-standing rivalry between Naveen Kumar and Muhammad Rashid.
12:02.980 - 12:10.940:  Muhammad first broke the record in 2014 with a total of 150 wool nuts cracked before shattering
12:10.940 - 12:19.860:  his own record again in 2016 with 181. Here later, in order to determine who was truly the world's
12:19.860 - 12:26.540:  best nutcracker, Naveen, who was 22 at the time, and Muhammad, who was 36, were brought together
12:26.540 - 12:33.700:  head-to-head, so to speak. On the set of the Italian TV program La Notte, they record the night of records.
12:38.760 - 12:43.160:  Both contestants broke the standing record with Muhammad emerging victorious,
12:43.160 - 12:54.240:  cracking 254 wool nuts compared to Naveen's 239. Now, five years later, Naveen's revenge has made
12:54.240 - 13:01.020:  headlines in Indian newspapers, prompting commentaries such as, Naveen has put blood, sweat and tears
13:01.600 - 13:08.060:  into reasserting himself as the world's foremost walnut cracker. Guinness World Records shared a
13:08.060 - 13:13.480:  video of the feet on Twitter showing Naveen smashing wool nuts on a table one by one with his
13:13.480 - 13:19.920:  forehead. Each had to crack into at least two halves, and he got only one attempt per nut.
13:19.920 - 13:26.280:  The video was posted only a few days ago and has already been viewed nearly 100,000 times
13:26.660 - 13:33.000:  with hundreds more likes and retweets. The comments included lines like, show me his forehead.
13:33.000 - 13:37.500:  There was one which probably best summed it all up. This is Nuts.
13:38.220 - 13:41.080:  That was Lippaker Palem. Please don't try that at home.
13:46.200 - 13:50.380:  Still to come. I just put him out there on the water, and he just kind of just loved it.
13:50.380 - 13:54.160:  He followed me in the water when I was trying to learn to surf myself. I just put him on a board,
13:54.160 - 13:59.160:  pushed him and he rode it all the way to the beach. A man, a dog, and a surfboard.
14:04.360 - 14:10.140:  It's a pretty good bet that you have at least one lithium ion battery somewhere near you right now.
14:10.140 - 14:15.120:  They turn up all over the place. In cell phones, tablets, laptops, scooters, e-bikes,
14:15.120 - 14:20.160:  toothbrushes, hearing aids, watches, and for solar power backup storage, you get the picture.
14:20.780 - 14:25.400:  But it's estimated that only about 5% of lithium ion batteries get recycled,
14:25.900 - 14:29.140:  and 14-year-old Srinahal Tamanah wants to fix that.
14:29.860 - 14:33.820:  And a few years ago, I used to just love to play with drones like eight-year-old me.
14:34.080 - 14:37.500:  Every day, I used to go out with my friends playing with drones. But then,
14:37.500 - 14:41.220:  after I learned about how much of an impact they're causing on the environment,
14:41.220 - 14:46.140:  that is when I got immediately connected. I realized that how could my cool little toy
14:46.400 - 14:49.500:  be connected to this big environmental problem?
14:49.680 - 14:52.680:  Just explain to us what the actual issue is.
14:52.920 - 14:58.160:  The issue is not that many people know about the importance of recycling use batteries.
14:58.760 - 15:03.380:  Did you guys know that over 15 billion batteries are thrown away each year worldwide?
15:04.180 - 15:08.360:  So after learning more about this, I realized that since not that many people know about this,
15:08.960 - 15:12.640:  I can start my organization recycling my battery to help support
15:12.640 - 15:16.580:  battery recycling and teach the people so that they can get the opportunity
15:17.160 - 15:19.320:  to recycle their used batteries for a better tomorrow.
15:19.680 - 15:23.980:  So your organization is recycled my battery, but what do you actually do?
15:24.600 - 15:28.020:  So we basically go to stores, public events, and door-to-door,
15:28.440 - 15:31.280:  talking to people on the importance of recycling use batteries.
15:31.660 - 15:35.680:  What do you guys do with your used batteries? So once a battery dies, what do you guys do with it?
15:36.920 - 15:37.960:  Normally, it's in the garbage.
15:38.760 - 15:40.160:  Yeah, we're throwing in garbage right now.
15:40.160 - 15:43.480:  I thought we put in the recycle, they take care of it.
15:43.600 - 15:46.740:  Are they going to reuse to create a new battery?
15:47.000 - 15:49.980:  Yeah, they basically take the batteries into a certain facility,
15:49.980 - 15:54.440:  in the chemicals that are extracted and those can be reused in new batteries,
15:55.020 - 15:56.240:  or let me use it in other items.
15:56.840 - 15:59.820:  So for example, outland batteries like a manganese and zinc
15:59.940 - 16:03.780:  can be used to make powerful fertilizer to grow and energize corn growth.
16:04.220 - 16:09.460:  Me and my team members replace battery bins and stores, libraries, offices, etc.
16:10.060 - 16:14.200:  And what sort of response do you get when you go out and you talk to adults?
16:14.780 - 16:17.100:  Throughout these years, I have noticed one thing.
16:17.500 - 16:21.320:  When an adult talks to an adult, it doesn't have necessarily such a big impact.
16:21.320 - 16:25.580:  So usually they're very supportive and shocked whenever I talk to them because
16:26.140 - 16:29.880:  they don't expect a young kid like me to run a nonprofit like this.
16:30.280 - 16:32.240:  And literally, you mentioned your team.
16:32.240 - 16:34.160:  Let's hear from a couple of them.
16:34.640 - 16:39.260:  Hi, I'm Nitya Tamana and I'm the founder and knee health sister.
16:39.880 - 16:40.860:  I'm eight years old.
16:41.100 - 16:45.860:  So I'm an executive board member when a battery bin is full.
16:45.860 - 16:51.080:  They give it to us and you investigate if the batteries are good or bad.
16:51.460 - 16:53.780:  My name is Dev Sharia Dosa Pati.
16:54.300 - 16:55.300:  I'm 13.
16:55.300 - 17:00.340:  When I was like in elementary school, I heard about all these like wildfires that were going on.
17:00.820 - 17:03.840:  And I did a little bit more research on like what the causes were.
17:04.380 - 17:06.680:  I knew that I had to do something.
17:07.520 - 17:08.500:  Now you're 14.
17:09.120 - 17:12.100:  So where do you see your future lying?
17:12.720 - 17:17.720:  I hope that in the future, I would be able to recycle the 15 billion batteries
17:17.720 - 17:20.180:  being thrown away each year worldwide to zero.
17:20.700 - 17:24.620:  So that way everybody knows about the importance of recycling batteries.
17:25.200 - 17:26.560:  So that is my ultimate goal.
17:27.300 - 17:31.320:  And you can hear more from Nihal in the documentary podcast of billion batteries
17:31.320 - 17:34.800:  look out for it on BBC Sounds or wherever you get your podcasts.
17:35.520 - 17:37.960:  Now, some of the other things that have caught our attention.
17:38.040 - 17:42.740:  The US has approved the first pill to treat postpartum or postnatal depression,
17:42.740 - 17:47.300:  a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated one in seven
17:47.300 - 17:48.340:  mothers in the US.
17:48.340 - 17:54.460:  It'll be sold under the name Zazove and is a once daily pill taken for two weeks.
17:54.460 - 17:58.640:  Somewhat surprisingly, until now treatment for the condition was available only as an
17:58.640 - 17:59.620:  intravenous injection.
18:00.340 - 18:02.680:  You might have noticed how obsessed we are with sleep.
18:02.680 - 18:07.620:  A travel company in Belgium is offering a special deal for couples if one of them snores.
18:08.120 - 18:12.080:  Under the De Blau Vogel offer, you'll get two hotel rooms instead of one,
18:12.080 - 18:16.520:  so you can both sleep in peace with a discount on the second room and a connecting door.
18:17.180 - 18:21.180:  Events have been taking place to celebrate 50 years since the birth of hip hop.
18:21.180 - 18:27.000:  It all began when brother and sister Cindy and Clive Campbell put on a back-to-school party
18:27.000 - 18:31.780:  in their parents' apartment in the Bronx using two turntables and a microphone.
18:32.400 - 18:37.220:  Depending on when you are listening, run DMC, Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube will be,
18:37.260 - 18:41.060:  are or have been performing at New York City's Yankee Stadium.
18:41.700 - 18:44.920:  Now, I'm not sure if this counts as good news as such, but it's certainly an achievement.
18:44.920 - 18:50.200:  Congratulations, Kimberly Winter from the US, who now holds the Guinness World Record
18:50.200 - 18:55.440:  for the loudest ever burp by a woman at 107.3 decibels.
18:55.920 - 18:57.020:  And no, we're not playing it.
18:57.640 - 18:59.700:  Now Nicole from South Africa said as this.
19:05.140 - 19:09.600:  And when we called Nicole, she suggested we talk to her mum, Rose.
19:10.380 - 19:16.980:  That was bacon and egg frying for the breakfast that we have on the weekend when it's a special day.
19:17.420 - 19:23.040:  It's something that in past years when I was on a farm, the whole family had every morning for breakfast.
19:24.160 - 19:28.800:  I think bacon and egg is the one thing you can eat every day and never get tired of.
19:28.800 - 19:34.580:  It's delicious, but what makes it special now is that these days, because it's fatty,
19:35.240 - 19:37.740:  it's wicked as well, which makes it even nicer.
19:38.620 - 19:40.460:  I cannot argue with any of that.
19:40.780 - 19:45.780:  Now, Nicole sent us this sound as the sound that brings her joy.
19:46.060 - 19:51.940:  And she said that you took her in and fed her up when she was really quite poorly.
19:51.940 - 19:53.420:  Tell us about that.
19:54.260 - 19:56.660:  She got very sick and she did what you do.
19:56.660 - 20:02.340:  You come home to mother and yes, I've fattened her up nicely and feeding her bacon and egg
20:02.340 - 20:04.480:  for breakfast is one of the things that helps.
20:04.860 - 20:09.680:  The food you had as a child, all the smell of food that you've had before in love,
20:09.680 - 20:13.320:  it brings back good feelings and good food makes you happy.
20:13.820 - 20:16.880:  Food is the one way you can show love and show caring.
20:17.300 - 20:22.180:  And I live on my own, then cooking is not very exciting when it's just for you.
20:22.180 - 20:24.860:  It's much more fun to cook for somebody else as well.
20:25.520 - 20:26.860:  Ross in South Africa.
20:28.040 - 20:32.940:  Six years ago, former paratrooper Christian Lewis set out for a long walk.
20:33.280 - 20:39.440:  He had ten pounds in his pocket, a dilapidated tent, and a plan to walk the coastline of the UK.
20:40.080 - 20:43.820:  Now that 14,000 kilometer journey is done, and along the way,
20:43.820 - 20:45.100:  Chris found some company.
20:45.100 - 20:50.440:  His fiance Kate, their baby son Magnus, and I know you all want this detail,
20:50.820 - 20:51.700:  a dog called Jet.
20:52.520 - 20:55.340:  And he says the journey restored his faith in humanity.
20:56.220 - 20:58.480:  After leaving the forces, I became a single parent.
20:58.760 - 21:03.080:  And somewhere along the line, after ten years, I'd lost my way a bit,
21:03.080 - 21:05.820:  and no matter what I did, nothing seemed to change.
21:05.900 - 21:08.300:  I've always described it as being a side of boxing.
21:08.300 - 21:10.200:  You just can't seem to fight your way out of it.
21:10.600 - 21:13.620:  I knew that I needed to do something drastic, and I knew that this was my chance
21:13.620 - 21:14.640:  to change something.
21:14.640 - 21:17.500:  So I just had this epithemy one day, a voice in my head just said,
21:17.500 - 21:18.920:  just go and walk the UK coastline.
21:19.280 - 21:22.620:  And literally a few days later, I was gone, and it was yet a life-changing decision,
21:22.620 - 21:23.160:  I must say.
21:23.660 - 21:26.760:  You know, I made a promise to myself the first day that I started this walk,
21:26.760 - 21:30.100:  that I just wanted to return back to Swansea, you know, a happy man.
21:30.560 - 21:32.960:  And I think the great thing about adventure, and you know,
21:32.960 - 21:36.020:  something so unplanned as well, is you just don't know what's around the next corner,
21:36.020 - 21:38.240:  and I returned to Swansea more than a happy man.
21:38.380 - 21:40.140:  And how did you pick up a partner along the way?
21:40.460 - 21:42.540:  Listen, I asked myself that question every single day.
21:44.340 - 21:46.780:  I think if you're doing something that you love doing,
21:46.940 - 21:49.940:  if you're doing a lot of it, then I think it's only natural that you're going to meet somebody
21:50.320 - 21:51.560:  who loves doing the same thing.
21:51.780 - 21:54.980:  And Kate and I, when we very first met, we just really hit it off.
21:54.980 - 21:57.540:  We played talks about things we wanted to do in the future,
21:57.540 - 22:00.060:  and I couldn't believe I was listening to somebody say,
22:00.060 - 22:02.100:  stuff that was so similar to what I wanted to do.
22:02.100 - 22:05.600:  So I think it was never so cool that Kate and I were going to get together.
22:05.800 - 22:06.820:  What do you do now, though?
22:06.820 - 22:09.060:  So you've walked around the UK coastline for six years.
22:09.060 - 22:11.500:  You've done this, you've raised a phenomenal amount for charity.
22:11.500 - 22:14.420:  Now, what do you do on a Sunday?
22:14.420 - 22:17.000:  I can't imagine you're the kind of guy who just sits down and watches the telly.
22:17.700 - 22:20.000:  It's a Kate and I've decided that we're going to head back up north.
22:20.000 - 22:22.900:  I think somewhere in Scotland where we can just have time to ourselves
22:23.100 - 22:24.420:  and just plan our next adventure.
22:24.420 - 22:26.460:  I know for a fact that Kate and I are sort of people
22:27.080 - 22:28.860:  that just love to be on the move all the time,
22:28.860 - 22:30.840:  seeing different places, seeing different cultures.
22:30.840 - 22:33.340:  So we're just going to go straight onto another adventure
22:33.340 - 22:34.660:  who don't know exactly what it is,
22:34.660 - 22:36.260:  but I'm pretty sure it'd be something ridiculous.
22:36.260 - 22:37.580:  And it'll take some time.
22:38.000 - 22:40.260:  Our little boy Magnus, he is just thriving
22:40.540 - 22:41.580:  in the outside life kind.
22:41.600 - 22:43.740:  We're just confident that I think anything that we think of
22:43.740 - 22:45.220:  we're just going to go out there and smash it.
22:45.920 - 22:48.240:  Christian Lewis was talking to Helen Skeleton.
22:48.860 - 22:52.660:  Now last week, we talked about the joy of watching live sport
22:53.040 - 22:54.040:  and to illustrate the point,
22:54.040 - 22:56.420:  thousands have just attended a big sporting event
22:56.420 - 22:57.900:  on the Californian coast.
22:58.200 - 23:02.180:  The annual world dog surfing championships have been taking place
23:02.180 - 23:05.040:  with different categories and disciplines for the competitors
23:05.440 - 23:08.880:  who are clad in colorful lifefests and cool sound glasses or goggles
23:09.460 - 23:11.100:  and appear to be thoroughly enjoying themselves.
23:11.500 - 23:14.820:  The extra large dog category was won by Derby.
23:15.320 - 23:19.500:  Derby and his human friend Kentucky Galle Hu also came second
23:19.960 - 23:22.280:  in the human dog tandem category.
23:22.920 - 23:24.740:  And Kentucky told us about the sport.
23:25.520 - 23:26.840:  The competitions are awesome.
23:27.000 - 23:28.740:  There's three categories for these competitions.
23:28.740 - 23:32.840:  There's the solo division where the dog is by itself on the board
23:32.840 - 23:37.040:  and owner pushes them into the wave and they ride the wave as long as they can
23:37.040 - 23:39.940:  and with style and is what is judged on.
23:40.260 - 23:43.660:  The second part of the competition is tandem dog dog where there's
23:43.880 - 23:46.500:  two or more dogs on a board that get pushed into a wave
23:46.820 - 23:50.760:  and is definitely a sight to see with all these different size dogs on one board.
23:51.340 - 23:53.040:  And then there's tandem dog human.
23:53.040 - 23:56.400:  We're both the owner and the dog are riding the waves together
23:57.000 - 23:58.160:  trying to make it all way to the beat.
23:58.420 - 24:01.880:  So the dogs usually as a solo when they're getting pushed in the wave,
24:01.940 - 24:03.820:  they're actually just riding the board.
24:03.960 - 24:07.700:  There are some dogs that I have seen that have actually shifted their weight
24:07.700 - 24:11.860:  that make the board do a little dance or even keep the nose up.
24:12.260 - 24:14.500:  And it's kind of cool to see that they kind of understand it like,
24:14.500 - 24:18.240:  hey, if I move back a little bit, this nose comes up and we go further.
24:18.440 - 24:22.880:  Now, of course, this is is a podcast and therefore people cannot see
24:22.880 - 24:26.480:  quite how magnificent Derby looks describe him for us.
24:27.400 - 24:30.000:  Derby is an 11 year old golden doodle.
24:30.140 - 24:31.520:  He's kind of a beige color.
24:31.600 - 24:37.160:  But he has a mohawk that goes all the way from his head down his back to his tail.
24:37.780 - 24:41.040:  Also, the mohawk part on his head is dyed blue.
24:41.540 - 24:42.960:  And he wears sunglasses.
24:43.440 - 24:46.000:  And I actually also have a blue mohawk.
24:46.040 - 24:48.260:  And we always wear the same matching sunglasses.
24:49.020 - 24:50.560:  And he's 11 now.
24:51.080 - 24:52.340:  How long has he been surfing?
24:52.380 - 24:54.500:  Has he been surfing since he was a pop?
24:55.400 - 24:59.100:  No, so I got Derby while I was living in Atlanta, Georgia at the time.
24:59.100 - 25:01.700:  We moved to San Diego seven years ago.
25:01.700 - 25:03.740:  He had never even stepped foot on a beach.
25:04.040 - 25:06.740:  Put him out there on the water and he just kind of just loved it.
25:06.740 - 25:10.540:  He jumped into water immediately, hanging out and followed me in the water
25:10.540 - 25:11.960:  when I was trying to learn to surf myself.
25:11.960 - 25:15.380:  And I just put him on a board and pushed him and he wrote it all the way to the beach.
25:15.660 - 25:19.120:  I was kind of mad and happy at the same time when I first saw him do it
25:19.120 - 25:20.480:  because I was like, man, that's pretty cool.
25:20.480 - 25:20.980:  You're surfing.
25:20.980 - 25:23.580:  Then I was like, oh man, you just learned how to surf before I did.
25:26.140 - 25:29.220:  And you say that he loved it, but hand on heart.
25:30.000 - 25:32.840:  Do you think he really loves it or he's just humoring you?
25:33.280 - 25:37.300:  Derby, when he hits the beach and I'm still out in the water after pushing him,
25:37.300 - 25:42.420:  he actually turns back around, runs back out to me and wants to do it again.
25:43.000 - 25:46.360:  And it's such a sight to see because like some dogs are kind of like hitting the beach
25:46.360 - 25:49.160:  and they're kind of like, well, I don't know if I want to go back out there or the owner
25:49.160 - 25:50.480:  has to get up and put him on the board.
25:50.900 - 25:52.740:  He gets on the board when I pull it up.
25:52.820 - 25:57.060:  There's times when I want to go surfing by myself and I'll leave the house with my board and
25:57.060 - 25:59.680:  he kind of gives me that look like, hey man, I come with you.
26:00.060 - 26:03.740:  So I have to get our tandem board out and he jumps in the truck and ready to go.
26:03.900 - 26:05.620:  He wants to do anything I want to do.
26:05.740 - 26:08.760:  We actually have a motorcycle sidecar that we ride around in.
26:08.760 - 26:10.700:  We have a bicycle sidecar.
26:11.080 - 26:12.340:  It's all such crazy stuff.
26:12.760 - 26:14.820:  Kentucky Gallehue, friend of Derby.
26:15.060 - 26:17.460:  And yes, I will be sharing his picture on social media.
26:17.460 - 26:20.120:  Of course, I will with the hashtag the happy pod.
26:24.540 - 26:26.120:  And that's it from us for now.
