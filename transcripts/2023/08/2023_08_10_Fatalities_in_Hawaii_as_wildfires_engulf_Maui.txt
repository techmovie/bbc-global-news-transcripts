01:08.900 - 01:11.680:  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:14.940 - 01:19.920:  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of first day, the 10th of August, these are our main stories.
01:19.920 - 01:25.740:  Officials in Hawaii have described apocalyptic scenes on one of the US state's main islands
01:25.820 - 01:30.500:  after wildfires destroyed buildings and forced residents to jump into the ocean.
01:31.100 - 01:34.900:  The death toll from a migrant shipwreck off the coast of Italy rises.
01:35.740 - 01:40.020:  Police officers in Northern Ireland say they are worried about their own security after a massive
01:40.020 - 01:45.640:  data breach. Also in this podcast.
01:45.920 - 01:51.560:  Back in 1997, very tired chicken farmer bought some rocks from a local quarry and as he was
01:51.560 - 01:56.020:  turning over one of the stones and hosing it off, this amazing fossil appeared underneath it.
01:56.320 - 02:00.800:  Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of large amphibian
02:01.100 - 02:05.020:  that lived in the Jurassic period more than 240 million years ago.
02:09.320 - 02:14.700:  But let's start in the United States and specifically on the island archipelago of Hawaii,
02:14.700 - 02:19.860:  where authorities are scrambling to rescue people who fled from numerous wildfires,
02:20.300 - 02:24.360:  whipped up by hurricane-strenched winds on one of the US state's main islands.
02:25.020 - 02:29.160:  As we record this podcast, at least six people are confirmed dead on Maui.
02:29.600 - 02:32.980:  Emergency services in one town there were said to be overwhelmed.
02:32.980 - 02:37.240:  Reports say the mobile phone and emergency networks went down.
02:37.300 - 02:42.300:  At a news conference in the capital Honolulu, the state's Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke
02:42.300 - 02:44.640:  said Maui was not a safe place to be.
02:45.040 - 02:48.900:  On certain parts of Maui we have shelters that are overrun.
02:48.900 - 02:52.380:  We have resources that are being taxed.
02:52.380 - 02:57.500:  We are doing whatever we can and the state is providing whatever support
02:57.840 - 03:02.840:  that we can to give support to both Maui and to the big island.
03:03.580 - 03:07.240:  Some people who fled their homes on Maui had to be rescued by helicopter
03:07.760 - 03:09.060:  after jumping into the sea.
03:09.500 - 03:13.360:  I spoke to the local journalist Malika Dudley who was forced to flee her home
03:13.820 - 03:17.220:  and she described what happened in the early hours of Tuesday morning.
03:17.760 - 03:23.220:  I smelled smoke and for a couple of hours there I was bugging my husband
03:23.240 - 03:24.940:  and saying I think something's wrong.
03:25.160 - 03:25.820:  I smell smoke.
03:25.820 - 03:29.360:  I think maybe our house is on fire and he was checking around the house
03:29.360 - 03:30.280:  and there was nothing there.
03:30.440 - 03:32.320:  And we knew that a red flag warning was posted.
03:32.320 - 03:36.140:  We knew the winds were high and that fires could spread very quickly.
03:36.140 - 03:40.840:  So we just figured it's not uncommon that a fire is somewhere else on the island.
03:40.940 - 03:44.400:  Unfortunately at 3am we were woken up by our neighbors
03:44.560 - 03:46.640:  who said it was right near us.
03:47.160 - 03:50.260:  And at 3am we looked out the window and the sky was red.
03:50.780 - 03:54.660:  We grabbed our children and a couple of suitcases with some toiletries
03:54.660 - 03:55.640:  and ran out the door.
03:55.820 - 03:58.680:  We went down to where I am now in Haleemaili.
03:58.820 - 04:05.080:  It's far enough away down the hill and upwind of where the fire was spreading at the moment
04:05.080 - 04:08.460:  and felt like we would be safe there and when we have been.
04:08.940 - 04:12.100:  Now we hear that hurricanes have whipped up these fires very quickly
04:12.100 - 04:14.520:  but do we know how the fires actually started?
04:15.120 - 04:19.940:  So to clarify that I'm a meteorologist so I actually was on the news on KITV4
04:19.940 - 04:21.780:  here on the weekend warning of this.
04:22.000 - 04:24.320:  The hurricane is well to the south of the island.
04:24.320 - 04:26.160:  It's more than 500 miles away.
04:26.720 - 04:29.660:  However it's a very strong hurricane and that low pressure system
04:30.160 - 04:32.220:  with high pressure to the north of the islands.
04:32.220 - 04:35.340:  Sandwich right in between those two pressure systems.
04:35.340 - 04:40.420:  The gradient got really tight and that's what whips up the really strong winds.
04:40.420 - 04:45.200:  So we knew we were going to have winds upwards of gusts of 60 miles per hour.
04:45.800 - 04:49.280:  What ended up happening was up to 80 mile per hour gusts
04:49.620 - 04:51.440:  and that really found the flames.
04:51.800 - 04:54.640:  But do we know if these are fires that started naturally or were
04:54.640 - 04:57.300:  is there any kind of suspicion that people were setting fires?
04:57.300 - 05:01.320:  When you have winds that strong we know that it pushes down power lines
05:01.320 - 05:04.880:  and trees and things and so power lines did go down.
05:04.880 - 05:07.740:  In fact 29 power lines went down in Lahaina alone
05:08.180 - 05:10.160:  and 30 total on the island.
05:10.260 - 05:13.600:  We do not have investigations have not been conducted yet
05:13.600 - 05:17.360:  because we're still in recovery and preserving life and property mode.
05:17.360 - 05:20.260:  We just found out that six people have lost their lives.
05:20.800 - 05:24.340:  Countless structures, homes, businesses have been lost to the fire.
05:24.700 - 05:28.880:  So at this point we do not have the official word that it was naturally started
05:28.880 - 05:33.160:  but the fact that we knew that you know this could happen with power lines going down
05:33.260 - 05:37.940:  it's a safe assumption to make that at least one or more of the fires
05:37.940 - 05:39.800:  were started of natural causes.
05:40.220 - 05:43.940:  Is there a sense that some parts of the island were just overwhelmed
05:43.940 - 05:47.240:  in terms of the emergency services, the ability to call them out
05:47.620 - 05:50.520:  hospital provision? I mean, did it get that bad? That serious?
05:51.540 - 05:54.460:  Absolutely, absolutely. In my neighborhood alone
05:54.540 - 05:57.640:  we had firemen there, they were monitoring situation.
05:57.760 - 06:01.240:  First of all they couldn't even get in there because the winds were so high
06:01.240 - 06:03.700:  they couldn't man the helicopters and the water drops.
06:03.700 - 06:05.820:  It was too dangerous. So they were waiting.
06:05.820 - 06:07.540:  They were just waiting for the brush the burn
06:07.540 - 06:11.280:  and then they would protect the homes if it got to that point.
06:11.280 - 06:16.020:  Unfortunately once the other fires started popping up around the rest of the island
06:16.020 - 06:19.340:  all firefighters were asked to work if they could
06:19.340 - 06:22.140:  and they just did not have enough resources.
06:22.180 - 06:24.660:  It just happened so so quickly.
06:25.320 - 06:27.720:  Malika Dudley speaking to me from Hawaii.
06:28.660 - 06:32.880:  Now in Brazil the president Louis Inacio Lula da Silva has brought a summit of
06:32.880 - 06:37.440:  eight countries that share the Amazon to a close saying that for the first time
06:37.440 - 06:39.460:  the rainforest has spoken for itself.
06:40.040 - 06:43.560:  The meeting ended with a commitment to work together as a region but fell
06:43.560 - 06:49.880:  short of promising to end deforestation by 2030 as had been proposed by the host
06:49.880 - 06:54.140:  Brazil. The declaration was drawn up in the Amazonian city of Belém from
06:54.140 - 06:56.920:  where our South America correspondent Katie Watson reports.
06:57.480 - 07:00.580:  This was a much heralded summit bringing together leaders from the
07:00.580 - 07:04.500:  countries with the most at stake. Those who share a piece of the world's
07:04.500 - 07:08.040:  largest rainforest. In a region that often feels very fragmented
07:08.480 - 07:12.060:  and with huge political differences between neighbors the fact that South
07:12.060 - 07:16.100:  America wants to be seen as a leader on climate change is a big change in
07:16.100 - 07:19.340:  itself. But those hoping to see an end to deforestation
07:19.340 - 07:22.880:  may be disappointed. Instead the countries issued a
07:22.880 - 07:26.740:  loose commitment to tackling the problem without giving big details on how.
07:27.380 - 07:30.920:  A head of the summit president Lula da Silva said this week would be a milestone
07:31.460 - 07:34.060:  one that would offer solutions rather than just talk.
07:34.540 - 07:36.960:  Critics may disagree but today Marina Silva
07:36.960 - 07:39.620:  Brazil's Environment Minister remained upbeat.
07:40.080 - 07:44.920:  Even though we didn't get this returning to the Belém de
07:44.980 - 07:47.840: forestation because we didn't come to our consensus
07:48.360 - 07:53.120:  Brazil is already committed to it and we will carry on with trying to achieve
07:54.040 - 07:57.700:  The Amazonian nations did say though that hunger, poverty, and violence
07:57.740 - 08:01.180:  needed to be tackled in order to effectively protect the rainforest from
08:01.180 - 08:04.920:  environmental crimes. There are 50 million people living in the Amazon
08:04.920 - 08:08.280:  and without giving them a future conservation will be harder.
08:08.840 - 08:12.640:  Marius was on a Ferreira González lives deep in the rainforest of Pará
08:12.640 - 08:15.480:  the state with the highest rate of deforestation.
08:17.360 - 08:20.100:  There's more farmer doesn't commit a crime because he wants to.
08:20.500 - 08:24.500:  It's because he needs to prepare the land so we can use it for our own use.
08:25.380 - 08:29.380:  So do we commit crimes? We do. We do it because we have to commit crimes.
08:30.100 - 08:31.560:  If we don't we go hungry.
08:35.080 - 08:37.880:  This week has put Belém and the Amazon in the spotlight.
08:37.880 - 08:42.120:  This region can and wants to play a big role in securing a better future for
08:42.120 - 08:45.920:  the rainforest. The world's experts and politicians will be back here in
08:45.920 - 08:48.580:  two years time for the COP 30 climate summit.
08:49.340 - 08:54.260:  Katie Watson in the Amazon. Now just under 14,000 kilometers to the west of
08:54.260 - 08:59.260:  there lies the Pacific Island nation of Tonga, where in recent days there's
08:59.260 - 09:03.880:  been a rush for warm clothing as its experience is an unusually cold winter
09:04.260 - 09:06.340:  driven by the El Niño weather phenomenon.
09:06.800 - 09:10.140:  Some store owners say hooded sweatshirts have completely sold out.
09:10.640 - 09:15.540:  Jersongli reports. Tonga's National Weather Agency says it recorded 9.3 degrees
09:15.540 - 09:20.080:  Celsius at the end of July, slightly above the country's lowest ever recorded
09:20.080 - 09:23.500:  temperature. For many, that might feel rather warm for winter,
09:23.980 - 09:28.280:  but Tonga usually sees temperatures of around 18 to 21 degrees Celsius during
09:28.280 - 09:32.020:  this season. Children have been pictured in their hoodies with arms wrapped
09:32.020 - 09:36.160:  around their body to beat the cold. The cold snap is expected to
09:36.160 - 09:39.780:  continue with temperatures as low as 10 degrees predicted next week.
09:40.800 - 09:44.660:  The Italian authorities have begun an investigation into the drowning of 41
09:45.300 - 09:51.560:  of the island of Lampedusa. 45 people have been aboard a boat which set off from Tunisia
09:51.560 - 09:57.340:  last Thursday before it capsized. Four survivors, originally from the Ivory Coast and Guinea,
09:57.920 - 10:01.640:  gave their account to Italian coast guards after being brought ashore.
10:02.120 - 10:06.640:  One of the groups involved in the rescue mission was Seawatch, which monitors the Mediterranean
10:06.640 - 10:12.560:  for migrant boats in distress. Paul Wagner, from the group, said the kind of boats used on the
10:12.560 - 10:17.980:  route from Tunisia were particularly dangerous. There's no life-saving equipment normally that
10:17.980 - 10:24.220:  refugees have on their boats, so they're all very insecure. The unspoiled boats that are used
10:24.220 - 10:29.580:  on the Tunisian road are specifically insecure as they sink very fast. So you're met
10:29.580 - 10:34.660:  around the middle of the ocean and your boat sinks and you're on a wooden boat, you can at least
10:34.660 - 10:40.740:  hold on to something that floats. Well, if you're boat sinks and you're on iron boat, they disappear
10:40.740 - 10:47.380:  within less than two minutes. In the last few days alone, more than 2,000 people have arrived in
10:47.380 - 10:53.420:  Lampedusa. Many had to be rescued at sea by Italian patrol boats after strong winds hit the coastal
10:53.420 - 10:58.440:  waters. This assessment of the latest tragedy from our Arab affairs editor Mike Thompson.
10:58.900 - 11:06.400:  Lampedusa is just what? 150 kilometres from Tunisia, from Svaks. So it's about the nearest
11:06.400 - 11:12.100:  land point you could get to. And when you talk about the numbers, yes, I mean, Tunisia has taken
11:12.100 - 11:16.800:  over from Libya as the biggest departure point for migrants. And when I was there, I saw
11:17.320 - 11:23.660:  boats piled high, literally maybe, you know, two metres high, one upon each other, all iron boats
11:23.660 - 11:29.920:  that we were hearing about just now complete wrecks. And so you look at those and you understand,
11:29.920 - 11:34.820:  just by that sight, the loss of life. In Tunisia, in particular, what are the push factors in terms
11:34.820 - 11:39.640:  of Tunisia at the moment that are forcing these people to seek to undergo this perilous route?
11:39.840 - 11:43.740:  Well, there are really two things. The first is people looking for a better life and that's
11:43.740 - 11:50.080:  the reason they fled the country they came from in many cases. But there's also the racism
11:50.080 - 11:55.560:  and the growing anti-migrant sentiment in the country. There was a speech by President
11:55.560 - 12:00.960:  Kaisai in February in which he talked of, in his own words, hordes of migrants heading to the
12:00.960 - 12:06.940:  country intent on a criminal plot to change the country's demography. And that's led to a lot of
12:06.940 - 12:11.220:  attacks on migrants. They've been pushed out of lodgings and sacked from their jobs,
12:11.220 - 12:17.960:  bust into the desert to border regions without food or water. And for many, they just want to get out.
12:17.960 - 12:23.660:  What about the place that many are initiating their journey from S-Facts? Can you tell us a bit more
12:23.660 - 12:28.200:  about that, why that's particularly problematic at the moment? Well, it's a place where I remember
12:28.200 - 12:33.320:  standing early morning on the coastline there and it looked beautiful. The Mediterranean was like a
12:33.320 - 12:39.520:  mill pond and suddenly the wind gets up and it's ferocious. And you can imagine what happens if
12:39.520 - 12:44.880:  you're out in a small iron boat and that whips up. It really is terrible. I mean, you find
12:44.880 - 12:50.380:  talked to people they had found bodies on the beach almost every day and a fisherman who'd fished
12:50.540 - 12:56.960:  15 migrants bodies out of his nets in just a few weeks. Mike Thompson, let's stay in Europe where
12:56.960 - 13:02.740:  Ukraine has refused to confirm reports that several dozen of its troops have managed to cross the
13:02.740 - 13:09.300:  De Nupro River in key southern battlegrounds, break Russian defences and then advance almost one kilometer.
13:10.020 - 13:15.300:  Sasha Schlister reports. On Tuesday, several of the Russian war bloggers reported that seven
13:15.300 - 13:21.600:  Ukrainian boats conducted a daring cross-river raid landing near the settlement of Khazakhilakhiri
13:21.600 - 13:27.800:  and advancing up to 800 meters. They reportedly exploited a Russian troop rotation which meant
13:27.800 - 13:33.020:  they faced an inexperienced enemy. The De Nupro forms a natural front line in the war,
13:33.020 - 13:38.300:  crossing it in high numbers would give Ukraine an immediate advantage opening the way to
13:38.300 - 13:44.340:  occupied Crimea and cities like Militoppel and Mariopel. But Ukraine's deputy defensive minister
13:44.340 - 13:48.740:  said journalists had to stick to official information and not Russian blogs.
13:49.500 - 13:54.720:  Sasha Schlister reporting. Now scientists have identified a new species of large amphibian
13:54.720 - 14:00.680:  about 1.2 meters long that lived in what is now Australia at the start of the Triassic period.
14:01.060 - 14:07.460:  Lacklen Hart is the PhD student who decoded the fossil. He's based at the University of New South
14:07.460 - 14:12.680:  Wales and the Australian Museum in Sydney and he first told Crouper Paddy how it was discovered.
14:13.360 - 14:18.920:  Back in 1997, Mary Tire chicken farmer who was living on the central coast of New South
14:18.920 - 14:23.820:  Wales bought some rocks from a local quarry to build a retaining wall for his garden that
14:23.820 - 14:29.200:  is property and as he was turning over one of the stones and hosing it off this amazing fossil
14:29.200 - 14:34.800:  appeared underneath it. Why has it taken so long to identify it? Simply because there hasn't been
14:34.800 - 14:41.940:  somebody who's had enough time and patience to do so. So it's a big part of my PhD project
14:42.420 - 14:46.820:  and so I've been ponding about this thing for about four years. Yeah I mean I have to say you
14:46.840 - 14:51.660:  first encountered this fossil as a child. Yeah so obviously the man who found the fossil
14:51.660 - 14:56.620:  alerted the Australian Museum which is based in Sydney and they had a few experts look at it but it
14:56.620 - 15:02.240:  was just coincidence that at the same time there was a touring exhibition called the dinosaur world
15:02.240 - 15:07.820:  tour and so they decided to put this fossil on display at that dinosaur world tour stop in Sydney
15:08.380 - 15:12.580:  and yeah I went there with my family my parents and my little brother and I saw the fossil for the
15:12.580 - 15:18.780:  first time then when I was 12 years old. From the data we have what can we understand about what
15:18.820 - 15:25.260:  this amphibian looked like when it was alive? It was rather large especially for its time. It looks
15:25.260 - 15:30.880:  a bit like a cross between a crocodile and a giant salamander. It's got a quite rounded shaped head
15:31.480 - 15:37.240:  with lots of tiny little teeth inside and also two quite large tusks like fangs. What more do we
15:37.240 - 15:44.040:  know about it? So it lived about 240 million years ago in what's now called the Sydney Basin.
15:44.480 - 15:49.820:  It was swimming in fresh water lakes and streams hunting fish more likely. And in terms of the
15:49.820 - 15:57.400:  significance of this discovery it's quite the rare find isn't it? It is so in paleontology we don't
15:57.400 - 16:04.040:  often find skeletons as complete as this one so this one has the head plus most of its skeleton
16:04.040 - 16:09.180:  of its body and it's also got soft tissue preserved in principle its skin and fatty tissue around the
16:09.180 - 16:14.160:  outside of its body. And does it give us a better understanding of evolution? Is it some kind of
16:14.160 - 16:20.400:  missing link perhaps? Not a missing link per se but what it does tell us is that these amphibians were
16:20.400 - 16:26.360:  going to considerably large sizes immediately after what's called the end permeant mass extinction
16:26.440 - 16:31.280:  event. The end permeant mass extinction event was the greatest mass extinction in Earth's history
16:31.280 - 16:38.140:  over 80% of all living things were wiped out. Temnospondals managed to survive and there was a theory
16:38.140 - 16:42.540:  that there should have been larger ones hanging around especially in Australia early on after this
16:42.540 - 16:48.300:  extinction event but this new discovery has cemented that theory. Can I just confirm it's got a name
16:48.300 - 16:53.680:  now? It does so one of the great fun things about being a paleontologist is we get to name
16:54.300 - 17:01.660:  species that we work on. So the name of this animal I've given is arena urpaton supernatus.
17:02.020 - 17:08.520:  So arena urpaton translates from Latin into sand creeper and the supernatus part refers to the
17:08.520 - 17:13.700:  fact that it's lying belly up so we can see parts of its chest bones and the underside of its
17:13.700 - 17:17.800:  head and its ribs and its spine but we can't see the top of its head or its eyes.
17:18.240 - 17:21.620:  Lachlan Hart from the University of New South Wales in Australia.
17:23.980 - 17:24.520:  Still to come.
17:34.340 - 17:38.900:  Sisto Rodríguez the searching for sugar man musician has died aged 81.
17:44.640 - 17:49.040:  Do you ever feel a bit overwhelmed when you check the news on your phone first thing in the morning?
17:50.260 - 17:54.380:  Whenever I open up my phone they're just endless warnings of more extreme weather to come.
17:54.640 - 17:59.580:  I'm Hannah I'm the presenter of a new podcast called What in the World from the BBC World Service.
18:00.060 - 18:04.460:  We're going to be here trying to help you make sense of the world around you so you can feel a
18:04.460 - 18:09.700:  little bit better about what's happening in the world. You can find What in the World wherever
18:09.700 - 18:16.700:  you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast next to Yemen, the poorest
18:16.700 - 18:22.020:  country in the Arab world which has been brought to the brink of collapse by almost a decade of
18:22.020 - 18:29.140:  civil war. Back in 2014 Hootie forces who are backed by Iran seized the capital. A Saudi
18:29.140 - 18:34.820:  led coalition supported by Britain and the United States intervened. But the Hooties have not been
18:34.820 - 18:39.720:  dislodged and still control Sana and the north where most of the population live.
18:40.340 - 18:44.900:  It has been less violent since a temporary truce last year between the Saudis and the Hooties
18:45.340 - 18:51.360:  but there's no sign of a comprehensive peace deal. Few places have suffered more than Taze,
18:51.360 - 18:57.640:  a city which for more than 3,000 days has been virtually besieged by Hootie forces.
18:58.320 - 19:03.280:  A senior international correspondent, Ola Geirin, spent several days in the city's main hospital.
19:06.600 - 19:12.200:  We're in the emergency department of Al-Thawra Hospital, the main hospital in Taze. It's
19:12.600 - 19:18.240:  very busy here, very chaotic. There's just been a rush of people coming in. Soldiers have been
19:18.240 - 19:26.460:  brought in injured on the front line. We meet a local man, Abdul Saeed Ahmed, who arrived with the
19:26.460 - 19:32.900:  casualties. He blames Hootie forces for the attack and says they don't just target soldiers.
19:36.040 - 19:41.020:  They attack civilian areas where there are children and innocent people. They hit hospitals.
19:41.540 - 19:47.440:  They strike randomly. Kill people who are not connected with the war. Sometimes they hit military
19:47.440 - 19:55.820:  targets. These days in Taze and in Yemen, it's not all out war but it's not peace either.
19:56.360 - 20:02.340:  The guns are quieter but this hospital is still receiving plenty of patience wounded by the conflict.
20:05.420 - 20:11.360:  On the bed just in front of me, there's a little boy. He's seven years old. His name is Muhammad Al-Wan.
20:15.980 - 20:20.920:  He's having a dressing changed on his hand. It's distressing for him. It's painful.
20:21.720 - 20:27.560:  He's lost several of his fingers. His uncle, Farhan, tells me what happened.
20:30.380 - 20:35.060:  He was playing with his brothers and suddenly there was an explosion. We didn't know what had
20:35.060 - 20:40.040:  caused it. The danger will last for hundreds of years because of the explosive remnants of war.
20:40.720 - 20:45.240:  The people who planted the landmines here did not leave a map so the pain and the injuries will
20:45.240 - 20:54.080:  continue for a long time. I'm surrounded by work benches and technicians in white coats,
20:54.940 - 21:04.320:  cutting, sewing, drilling and filing. They're making artificial limbs. Many of those who come here
21:04.320 - 21:11.880:  are children. I'm sitting with Shema Ali Ahmad, who's 12 and Shema has just had her weekly
21:11.940 - 21:18.040:  physiotherapy session here at the prosthetics clinic and she's been telling me what life is like
21:18.040 - 21:27.580:  and ties for children like her. Children here suffer. They've lost their arms and legs. They don't
21:27.580 - 21:33.300:  go out and play like other children around the world. They play in comfort but we play in fear.
21:34.040 - 21:39.360:  We just stand by the doors of our homes. When we hear shelling or gunfire, we run back inside.
21:40.760 - 21:46.260:  Shema was maimed by a landmine which took her right leg and killed her friend.
21:47.220 - 21:52.120:  She's determined to be a lawyer and she has a question for the international community.
21:54.860 - 22:00.660:  Why don't you see the children of Thais? Why all this neglect? Are we not humans in your eyes?
22:02.080 - 22:07.860:  That report from Olegirin in Yemen. Next, let's go to Northern Ireland where officers and
22:07.860 - 22:14.060:  civilians working for the regional police service there, also known as the PSNI, have expressed fear
22:14.060 - 22:19.800:  and anger after some of their personal details were published online by the force in a major
22:19.800 - 22:25.300:  data breach. The data released on Tuesday is particularly sensitive because of Northern Ireland's
22:25.300 - 22:30.900:  troubled past and security threats facing police from dissident paramilitary groups.
22:31.560 - 22:33.800:  Our islands correspondent Chris Page has more.
22:34.220 - 22:40.260:  Police everywhere face danger. In this part of the UK the risks are especially stark.
22:40.260 - 22:45.360:  Members of the police service of Northern Ireland take particular steps to protect their identities
22:45.540 - 22:53.140:  but information appeared online about all 10,000 staff. Two serving officers have told the BBC about
22:53.140 - 22:58.100:  the distress the lake has caused. Their words are spoken here by BBC producers.
22:58.700 - 23:02.400:  We go to great lengths to hide what we do even from our children to protect them
23:02.760 - 23:07.160:  so they don't innocently tell the wrong person and put themselves or us as a family at risk of danger.
23:07.680 - 23:11.560:  I have chosen to do this job and over time I've become accustomed to the risks
23:12.120 - 23:16.400:  but what this breach has done is highlight the fear and concern that my family have.
23:16.660 - 23:21.960:  The problem came about after a routine request for data under freedom of information laws
23:21.960 - 23:28.080:  but the police also released a huge Excel spreadsheet by mistake containing the surname,
23:28.080 - 23:34.600:  initials and work departments of every employee. The details were on a website for about two hours.
23:34.600 - 23:40.340:  The policing board which holds senior officers to your kind has called an emergency meeting.
23:40.340 - 23:45.400:  The storm at assembly member Mike Nezbit who represents the Ulster Unionist party on the board
23:45.400 - 23:49.240:  said he was mainly concerned about three categories of officers.
23:49.780 - 23:56.200:  That's undercover officers that that is officers who have an unusual surname because they will
23:56.200 - 24:02.140:  actually be somewhat easier potentially to trace and the third category is officers from a Catholic
24:02.140 - 24:07.460:  nationalist background and it's that last category who have been most in touch with me over the
24:07.460 - 24:13.740:  last 24 hours. During the conflict known as the Troubles more than 300 police officers were killed,
24:14.420 - 24:19.760:  attacks are much more rare now but dissident Republican paramilitaries who oppose the peace
24:19.760 - 24:26.200:  process continue to target members of the security forces. Earlier this year a detective John
24:26.200 - 24:32.280:  Coldwell was shot and critically injured by the group known as the new IRA. Northern Ireland's
24:32.280 - 24:37.760:  former justice minister Naomi Long said the terrorism threat was already stretching police
24:37.760 - 24:43.620:  resources and the service might not have the budget to deal with the consequences of the data leak.
24:43.960 - 24:49.040:  The reality is that at the moment the PS and I don't have that capacity but a security assessment
24:49.040 - 24:55.060:  would need to be made by the chief constable where someone did need and potentially to have either
24:55.060 - 24:59.200:  additional security or to be moved. The attend individual officer would have to be at a set.
24:59.200 - 25:05.260:  The police said they were investigating another data breach. In July a police laptop and documents
25:05.260 - 25:10.680:  were stolen from a car. They included a spreadsheet with the names of 200 workers.
25:10.740 - 25:16.200:  Chris Page reporting from Northern Ireland. Let's go to China now and the aftermath of widespread
25:16.200 - 25:22.280:  flooding there. A more detailed picture is emerging of the impact and scale of floods following a
25:22.280 - 25:27.860:  typhoon that first hit in the east of the country almost two weeks ago. Dozens of people have died,
25:27.860 - 25:33.880:  tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed. The impact on the country's economy is estimated to
25:33.880 - 25:39.660:  be in the billions of dollars. Now as is often the case with state controlled propaganda in China
25:39.660 - 25:45.400:  the coverage of what happened is not always the same as other stories that are now emerging from
25:45.400 - 25:52.800:  affected communities as our China media analyst Kerry Allen explains. State media dominates
25:53.220 - 25:58.300:  the the media environment within the country. So there is yes this very much this focus on
25:58.800 - 26:04.460:  we did tell you and and the positives of the community pulling together so it's very much
26:04.460 - 26:10.400:  saturated by that whereas on social media platforms like Weibo for example you will see censorship
26:10.400 - 26:14.960:  if people try to vent their frustration specifically against the government but there is a lot
26:14.960 - 26:21.020:  of anxiety at the moment because these floods persist in the country and people are being warned but
26:21.260 - 26:25.800:  the cleaner populations are not happening quickly enough so yeah there's a lot of anxiety in the
26:25.800 - 26:29.840:  country at the moment. When I was living and working in China I covered a flood in her man in
26:29.840 - 26:38.180:  Zhengzhou back in 2021 where 14 people drowned in an underground metro carriage and part of the reason
26:38.580 - 26:42.940:  for that was because essentially there's a man-made problems in that city itself and it was dealt
26:42.940 - 26:47.380:  with very quickly by the authorities there. Is there any sense in media coverage or beyond that
26:47.380 - 26:52.300:  on social media platforms that part of the problems they're facing in these massive Chinese cities
26:52.300 - 26:57.780:  and beyond is partly man-made? Oh absolutely yes I mean you know even though the media has been so
26:57.780 - 27:03.460:  focused on the northeast in recent weeks I've seen media coverage of cities like Xi'an in the
27:03.460 - 27:09.000:  north for example where there's been infrastructure damage in urban regions also today I've been reading
27:09.000 - 27:15.720:  a report on how an underground garage was flooded in Hongzhou a city in the east so you know there's
27:15.720 - 27:20.900:  social media frustration from people that you know these are meant to be areas where you hear that
27:21.040 - 27:25.880:  you know China is ahead of the game when it comes to dealing with floods especially as we're
27:25.880 - 27:30.300:  entering an era of climate change and you're going to be hearing more and more about these in the
27:30.340 - 27:34.640:  future. And just finally on that issue of climate change does climate change in this being the
27:34.640 - 27:39.680:  impact of climate change for which China is obviously partly responsible at the moment does that
27:39.680 - 27:44.140:  feature in state media coverage or does that feature kind of down the coal face as it were in terms
27:44.140 - 27:47.680:  of those people who have lost their livelihoods lost their cars do they talk about climate change as
27:47.680 - 27:52.580:  well? Well one thing I always find really interesting is when I'm reading Chinese media you will
27:52.580 - 27:59.220:  often never see if there's a domestic story any mention of climate change whatsoever normally
27:59.220 - 28:04.900:  you'll see the words climate change in reference to events like fires and floods that happen in
28:04.900 - 28:09.680:  the west particularly so you'll often see messaging on how when it comes to climate change there's
28:09.680 - 28:14.680:  a global responsibility whereas when it comes to China and stories of tackling floods tackling
28:14.680 - 28:19.720:  heat waves for example you'll see instead this message of pulling together the community pulling
28:19.720 - 28:25.240:  together technology moving quicker and quicker so real focus is on the positives and this this
28:25.240 - 28:29.960:  other story of climate change very much being an other issue that affects the west more than
28:29.960 - 28:35.820:  anywhere else. Kerry Allen. Now the culture minister in Lebanon Mohamed Mortada has asked
28:35.820 - 28:41.700:  censors there to ban the film Barbie saying the billion dollar movie promotes homosexuality
28:41.840 - 28:48.240:  and transgender culture and undermines the family the film may now be pulled or have scenes cut
28:48.240 - 28:54.120:  from it as Tom Bateman explains. Barbie's digs a patriarchy obviously fell flat at the summer
28:54.120 - 28:59.360:  residence of Lebanon's Maronite Patriarch or local leader of the Eastern Catholic Church.
29:00.080 - 29:04.940:  He had hosted a meeting of cabinet ministers after which the culture minister asked censors to
29:04.940 - 29:10.820:  ban the movie the news may be surprising from Beirut a cosmopolitan city in an often conservative
29:10.820 - 29:17.440:  region and the LGBTQ movement has one considerable victories in Lebanon including the Arab world's
29:17.460 - 29:24.380:  Pride Week in 2017. Tom Bateman on banning Barbie. Now we're going to mark the death of a musician
29:24.380 - 29:30.900:  who for many many years didn't know how successful he was. Sister Rodriguez the American musician
29:30.900 - 29:37.120:  and subject of the documentary searching for sugar man has died. He was 81 originally from
29:37.120 - 29:44.200:  Detroit in the US his music resonated far away from his hometown in a country deeply divided by
29:44.200 - 29:50.160:  racism prejudice and violence but for a long time he didn't know that he'd struck a chord in South
29:50.160 - 29:57.780:  Africa. I spoke to our entertainment reporter Stephen McIntosh. Sugar man won't you hurry
29:58.980 - 30:07.940:  because I'm tired of these scenes. Sister Rodriguez is a really interesting singer in the sense that
30:07.940 - 30:14.560:  he released his first albums in the early 1970s and yet he didn't have much success when they
30:14.560 - 30:19.520:  first came out particularly in the US and he was born in Detroit he was a Mexican American singer
30:20.060 - 30:24.580:  because the songs didn't have that much success they ultimately they ultimately led to him being
30:24.580 - 30:28.800:  dropped by his record label but then a really interesting thing happened over the following
30:28.800 - 30:33.780:  couple of decades he developed this cult following in South Africa and that's where he enjoyed
30:33.780 - 30:38.580:  the most success. Now I mean infamously he didn't know about this did he but just explain
30:38.660 - 30:44.620:  why he became so popular in South Africa unbeknownst to him. Well it ultimately stems
30:44.620 - 30:50.580:  back to bootlegged copies you got to remember this is back in the days when tape to tape or a CD to
30:50.580 - 30:55.780:  CD recording was really very popular there was a lot of piracy around so these albums one of his
30:55.780 - 31:00.480:  albums in particular was just kind of being copied and passed around the country and he was developing
31:00.480 - 31:06.360:  this following and it was kind of adopted if you like by young people as a kind of protest as part
31:06.360 - 31:11.800:  of the anti apartheid movement his popularity was growing and yet you know as far as he knew he'd
31:11.800 - 31:15.720:  been dropped by his record label two decades earlier he didn't know that he was enjoying all the
31:15.720 - 31:19.700:  success in South Africa he just went back into construction work and was living a life of relative
31:19.700 - 31:24.740:  obscurity back in America. So it was politics and it was the apartheid era at the time and a protest
31:24.740 - 31:30.240:  against that by young black people in South Africa that was the reason for his success at the time but
31:30.240 - 31:34.480:  let's talk a bit about the music I mean what kind of music was it? The closest comparison and perhaps
31:34.480 - 31:38.220:  it's an obvious and perhaps lazy comparison but it's a fair one is Bob Dylan.
31:43.260 - 31:48.960:  It was kind of like a mixture of blues folk their voices actually were quite similar and it was
31:48.960 - 31:53.480:  just this quite soulful folksy music I mean the albums are very good you know this is high quality
31:53.480 - 31:57.640:  music it was just under appreciated in its time if you like and he didn't enjoy anything like the
31:57.640 - 32:03.160:  success that Bob Dylan enjoyed so once he did eventually discover his success in South Africa
32:03.580 - 32:08.900:  which he did because his daughter came across this website dedicated to him in 1990s that's how
32:08.900 - 32:13.160:  he found out that's how he found out and you've got to remember in 1997 this is the days of the
32:13.160 - 32:17.520:  internet really and it's relative infancy to be honest but his daughter came across this website
32:17.520 - 32:22.180:  found that he had this huge following in South Africa he then ended up going on this tour decades
32:22.180 - 32:26.520:  after these albums were first released in South Africa and that ultimately became the subject of this
