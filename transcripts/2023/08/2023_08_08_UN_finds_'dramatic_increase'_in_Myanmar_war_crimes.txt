00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:17.560:  by advertising. Do you ever feel a bit overwhelmed when you check the news on your phone first
00:23.820 - 00:27.040:  thing in the morning? I'm Hannah, I'm the presenter of a new podcast called What in the World
00:27.060 - 00:31.960:  from the BBC World Service. We're going to be here trying to help you make sense of the world
00:31.960 - 00:37.660:  around you so you can feel a little bit better about what's happening in the world. You can find
00:37.660 - 00:45.680:  What in the World wherever you get your BBC podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World
00:45.680 - 00:55.240:  Service. I'm Alex Ritson and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 8th of August, these are our main stories.
00:55.760 - 01:00.800:  United Nations investigators say they've gathered evidence of frequent and brazen war crimes
01:00.800 - 01:06.600:  by Myanmar's military. A BBC investigation into widespread sexual abuse and violence by
01:06.600 - 01:13.560:  supposed spiritual healers in Sudan and Morocco. A report from the Amazon as South American leaders
01:13.560 - 01:23.080:  gather to try and stop the chopping of the rainforest. Also in this podcast July was the world's
01:23.080 - 01:29.960:  hottest month ever, according to EU scientists. At the start warning from the US Secretary of State
01:29.960 - 01:36.960:  Anthony Blinken to the co-leaders in Niger about Russia's Wagner mercenaries. Every single place that
01:36.960 - 01:41.260:  this group Wagner group has gone death destruction and exploitation have followed.
01:44.960 - 01:50.800:  We begin in Myanmar where UN investigators say there's been a dramatic increase in war crimes
01:50.800 - 01:56.960:  and crimes against humanity under the military junta. We got more details from our Geneva correspondent
01:56.960 - 02:04.260:  Imogen folks. This is their annual report looking at the period July 22 to July 23. They have
02:05.180 - 02:12.940:  hundreds more than 700 sources including 200 eyewitness accounts. They have satellite imagery,
02:13.980 - 02:19.100:  forensic evidence and what they're pointing to particularly are what they say are really
02:19.100 - 02:25.740:  indiscriminate attacks on civilians from the bombing of entire villages,
02:26.180 - 02:33.800:  burning villages, mass execution of civilians detained during military operations as well as
02:33.800 - 02:41.200:  mass executions of detained fighters. The investigators completely dismiss Myanmar's claim that
02:41.200 - 02:48.300:  only opposition fighters are targeted. This is a purely strictly military operation.
02:48.300 - 02:54.960:  They say that's absolutely not the case. They should have, indeed, possibly did know that they were
02:54.960 - 03:00.100:  and intended to target civilians. To reports like this, they make any difference.
03:00.800 - 03:04.380:  Well, that's a really good question because traditionally, UN human rights reports.
03:05.140 - 03:11.420:  They are power lies simply in publicity. They carefully investigate and then they publish their
03:11.420 - 03:20.820:  findings. But this rather clunky UN independent investigative mechanism is designed to build cases
03:20.820 - 03:29.960:  which can be used in prosecutions. So the investigators are building case files on individuals
03:30.720 - 03:38.520:  leading Myanmar leaders in its military and the evidence that they have can be and indeed is
03:38.520 - 03:43.960:  being passed to bodies like the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice.
03:44.640 - 03:50.900:  So there is the potential at least for prosecutions, for alleged war crimes and crimes against
03:50.920 - 03:58.000:  humanity. Which will scare presumably the military leaders. Well, it will certainly tell them that
03:58.000 - 04:03.180:  it's going to be a bit risky for them to ever leave Myanmar. We have seen these prosecutions
04:03.180 - 04:08.580:  in the past. But typically, if you look at, for example, the former Serbian leader, Sloughed
04:08.580 - 04:16.420:  and Milosevic, he had to lose power and was then delivered to the hage. Others you see with the
04:16.420 - 04:25.200:  Syria war crimes trials that people who have passed as refugees into Europe are then tried with
04:25.200 - 04:30.380:  countries using universal jurisdiction and trying them on their territory. So it's either lose
04:30.380 - 04:35.680:  power or leave Myanmar. We will see Myanmar's military in court, but not before that.
04:35.700 - 04:43.020:  Imagine folks in Geneva. July sought forest fires across large areas of North America, Southern
04:43.020 - 04:48.860:  Europe and Northern Africa. severe heat waves in South America and China. And typhoons and
04:48.860 - 04:54.960:  flooding across much of Asia. Now it's been confirmed that last month was the hottest ever recorded
04:55.020 - 05:00.720:  on earth. The European Union's climate observatory Copernicus says the average global temperature
05:00.720 - 05:08.860:  was 16.6 Celsius, a third of a degree higher than the previous record in 2019. While that may not sound
05:08.860 - 05:15.420:  very warm to some people, it is very significant as our environment correspondent Matt McGrath told me.
05:16.320 - 05:19.820:  You're right, it doesn't sound like an awful lot considering some of the temperatures we've
05:19.820 - 05:23.980:  seen around the world in the 30s and 40s over the last couple of weeks. But you have to remember,
05:23.980 - 05:30.160:  this is a global average taken from billions of readings from aircraft from satellites from
05:30.160 - 05:34.980:  weather stations all over the world and it's day and night, it's from valleys and mountains. So it's
05:34.980 - 05:41.160:  a very comprehensive view across the world. And as you say July this year was the hottest on record,
05:41.600 - 05:46.460:  hotter than July 2019 by about a third of a degree, but the long term average here and the long
05:46.460 - 05:52.800:  term average is only from 1990 to 2020. It beats the July figure for that period of three decades
05:52.800 - 05:57.640:  by three quarters of a degree. And I think scientists will see that as very significant that even in
05:57.640 - 06:02.780:  the recent decades, it's three quarters of a degree warmer than those figures. And with scientists
06:02.780 - 06:07.120:  have repeated last week's warning about ocean temperatures too. Yes, indeed, the ocean temperatures
06:07.120 - 06:11.800:  last week were peaking around 21 degrees. There were just the Gulf of Mexico described as being
06:11.800 - 06:17.080:  as warm as a bath. And I think this record from Copernicus also shows that this has been happening
06:17.080 - 06:21.900:  for several months now, including July. We saw that temperatures have been going up since April in
06:21.900 - 06:26.260:  the North Atlantic. That was about one degree warmer than average in July. And all of this is
06:27.040 - 06:32.240:  compounded by heat waves at sea. These big marine heat waves are called threatening species.
06:32.240 - 06:37.240:  And also reducing the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide, which may in turn
06:37.300 - 06:41.780:  make warming worse in the near future. Warnings are all well and good, though, but it does
06:41.780 - 06:45.780:  sometimes fail as those scientists with reports like this are just shouting into the abyss.
06:46.040 - 06:50.300:  I think there's a real danger here that both for politicians and for many people that we're
06:50.300 - 06:55.040:  becoming enured to record breaking, becoming used, if you like, to these kind of record-breaking
06:55.040 - 06:59.840:  temperatures that people are reporting. And I think that governments and people are also
06:59.840 - 07:03.880:  realizing that making the changes to move away from fossil fuels, which are the main cause of
07:03.880 - 07:08.740:  these rising temperatures, is an expensive business and difficult for many people to do in the
07:08.740 - 07:13.100:  midst of a global cost-to-living crisis. But I think, and I fear, that over the rest of the year,
07:13.100 - 07:19.840:  we will see more records and more data as El Nino kicks into gear in the waters of South America,
07:19.840 - 07:24.920:  driving temperatures ever higher. I think politicians come the big climate meeting at the end
07:24.920 - 07:29.500:  of this year, we'll have to make some very tough decisions faced with the reality of climate
07:29.500 - 07:35.540:  changes we're experiencing it now. Matt McGraw. Climate change and how to tackle it
07:35.540 - 07:41.820:  is also at the top of the agenda in the Brazilian city of Belem, leaders from South American countries
07:41.820 - 07:47.360:  that share the Amazon rainforest. A meeting to discuss measures to save it. The latest figures
07:47.360 - 07:53.460:  show deforestation has fallen by 66 percent since Brazil's president Lula came to power.
07:53.920 - 07:59.500:  After several years of rising deforestation under far-rightly debt giant Bolsonaro, Lula has
07:59.500 - 08:07.400:  promised zero deforestation by 2030. Is that an impossible task? Our South America correspondent Katie
08:07.400 - 08:11.980:  Watson reports from Para, the most deforested state in Brazil.
08:16.380 - 08:21.400:  Delegates are being welcomed with the lively folkloric dance routine as they pass through rivals at
08:21.400 - 08:26.700:  Belem airport. President Lula de Silva called this summit to bring together the eight South American
08:26.700 - 08:34.500:  nations who share a slice of the Amazon to find ways of protecting it. I think the world needs to
08:34.500 - 08:39.640:  look at this meeting in Belem as a milestone he told me last week. I've participated in several
08:39.640 - 08:45.440:  meetings and many times they talk, talk, talk, approve a document and nothing happens. This
08:45.440 - 08:49.960:  meeting is the first great opportunity for people to show the world what we want to do.
08:52.240 - 08:55.060:  For those on the ground though, it's been a difficult few years.
08:55.440 - 09:02.160:  Hobson González lives a 13-hour boat ride from Belem on Ilha de Marrojo. This part of Brazil has
09:02.160 - 09:04.520:  been the hardest hit by deforestation.
09:07.540 - 09:12.180:  You have no idea how much pressure there was in our community under the Bolsonaro government.
09:13.240 - 09:17.920:  Lent owners circling the planes, soya farmers wanting to buy the land to deforested.
09:18.580 - 09:22.900:  The Hobson's community stood firm and then having courted by a newer industry.
09:23.200 - 09:28.380:  Businesses that emit carbon dioxide can buy carbon credits to offset the pollution they create
09:28.960 - 09:31.440:  and those credits can be found in sustainable projects.
09:32.700 - 09:37.180:  But such is the growth of this industry. Carbon credit companies operating in Ilha de Marrojo
09:37.180 - 09:42.200:  have been accused of harassing people to sign their contracts. Much of the problems arise
09:42.200 - 09:47.040:  because the state's so absent in the Amazon. Paras public prosecutor has since got involved
09:47.040 - 09:52.160:  to hope projects that have caused concern. Prosecutor Eliani Moreira has helped draw up
09:52.160 - 09:54.920:  guidelines in what is still an unregulated market.
09:55.320 - 10:02.040:  When the state is on there, it creates a no-minsland where anything can happen.
10:03.620 - 10:08.680:  On the banks of the Amazon River Hernandez-Pantoja is hopeful that carbon credits can give
10:08.680 - 10:13.120:  him a better future. He proudly shows off his assay in cacao plantations.
10:14.380 - 10:17.520:  The machinery and training were provided for by CarbonX,
10:17.860 - 10:21.860:  a Brazilian carbon credit company that's received investment funding from Shell.
10:22.120 - 10:26.820:  Just last year, we checked out five illegal solmios from our land.
10:27.400 - 10:31.800:  The community knows that defending their territory from illegal logging is a challenge on their own,
10:32.120 - 10:36.980:  but partnering with a company like CarbonX with the funds behind it is the best way forward.
10:39.500 - 10:44.000:  We won't support to look after our forests. We don't want to cut down trees anymore.
10:47.160 - 10:51.040:  For CarbonX, empowering the communities to look after their land is important.
10:51.040 - 10:56.140:  Janaeena Dalan is the CEO. When Global North comes to Global South and say,
10:56.280 - 11:00.820:  I have a solution, we're like, really, have you been to the Amazon? How do you know?
11:00.820 - 11:05.440:  What's good for them? How can you solve that problem? If you've never been there,
11:05.600 - 11:08.840:  you don't have your boots on the ground. People on the ground in the Amazon,
11:08.840 - 11:14.600:  and those at the summit this week, had determined to make South America's voice heard when it comes
11:14.600 - 11:21.080:  to climate change. Katie Watson. The world's second
11:21.080 - 11:27.280:  biggest economy is having problems. China has suffered big falls in both exports and imports.
11:27.280 - 11:34.180:  Exports for July were 14.5% down on the year before the weakest level since February 2020.
11:34.220 - 11:38.120:  As Nick Marsh reports from our Asia Business Hub in Singapore,
11:38.640 - 11:42.960:  China appears to be suffering from the economic version of Long COVID.
11:44.120 - 11:49.840:  These figures for trade are actually even worse than economists had anticipated in terms of exports.
11:49.840 - 11:54.700:  It's the weakest data since back in February 2020 when China, of course,
11:54.700 - 12:01.820:  was right in the thick of the pandemic. Why is this data so bad? Well, it's mainly to do with China's
12:01.820 - 12:07.700:  customers abroad. They're really struggling with high inflation, high interest rates,
12:07.700 - 12:12.540:  so they're spending less money on Chinese goods. If you're a policymaker in Beijing,
12:12.540 - 12:16.560:  well, it's difficult to say what you should do about that. You can't just force other countries
12:16.560 - 12:21.880:  to start buying more of your goods, but there's also more to contend with. If you look at the spending
12:21.880 - 12:28.580:  within China, that's also looking not very encouraging at the moment. Tomorrow, we're expecting
12:28.580 - 12:35.280:  some more figures to be coming out, which will probably show deflation prices actually going down
12:35.840 - 12:41.600:  in China. That's a bit more difficult to explain, but there are some people who think that China's
12:41.600 - 12:47.800:  zero-coded policy went on for so long that customers just aren't ready to splurge post-pandemic,
12:48.220 - 12:52.640:  like they did in Europe, like they did in the United States. So you've got problems outside of China,
12:52.640 - 12:58.140:  people not ready to spend on Chinese goods, and within China as well. Nick Marsh.
12:59.300 - 13:05.040:  If you use your laptop in public, you might want to be careful about who might be listening in.
13:05.040 - 13:10.160:  Researchers in Britain have shown it's possible to work out what you're typing by recording
13:10.160 - 13:16.300:  the sound of tapping on your keyboard, and then putting it through an AI model. The paper by
13:16.300 - 13:21.740:  researchers from Durham, Surrey, and Royal Holloway universities was published at the European
13:21.740 - 13:28.940:  Symposium on Security and Privacy. My colleague Oliver Conway spoke to the lead author, Joshua Harrison.
13:29.820 - 13:36.120:  This paper was a proof of concept in which we tried to show the possibility of a machine learning
13:36.120 - 13:42.840:  model recognizing which key is being pressed. Purely based off the sound recorded from just an
13:42.840 - 13:47.820:  iPhone sat nearby on a table, no further away than you might get to someone sat next to a coffee shop.
13:48.580 - 13:56.240:  We recorded a big amount of key presses on this laptop, then we filtered them through this machine
13:56.240 - 14:01.180:  learning model, and the machine learning model broke a good amount of records in terms of the
14:01.180 - 14:06.240:  accuracy of the predictions that it made. When you gave it a sound, how well could it predict
14:06.240 - 14:12.840:  that sounds key from the recordings that we made? So each key has a different sound and it's
14:12.840 - 14:18.980:  able to work out from the sound which key you've hit. Yes, so if you think of a drum, the different
14:18.980 - 14:24.260:  areas that you hit on the drum will make different noises, and there's not so dissimilar system
14:24.260 - 14:30.020:  going on here where you have in this case a laptop with four feet on the table, and where you
14:30.020 - 14:35.340:  hit on that kind of plate, that metal plate with four feet on the table is going to change the
14:35.340 - 14:40.300:  sound similar to that drum. And so these little variations in the sounds that are produced when you
14:40.300 - 14:45.760:  hit those keys and be picked up with something like, in our case, a deep learning algorithm.
14:46.360 - 14:51.700:  So with this only work on say a traditional keyboard rather than if you're tapping on your smartphone,
14:51.700 - 14:58.780:  for example, our model specifically works on the model of laptop that we tested, but in terms of
14:58.780 - 15:04.780:  touch screen specifically, these have been found to be vulnerable to using the microphone in the
15:04.780 - 15:11.080:  device. So for example, if we were on FaceTime and you were typing on your phone while we were
15:11.080 - 15:16.980:  on FaceTime, I'm listening to those taps through the microphones in your device. And those in
15:16.980 - 15:23.020:  different papers that we have cited, those papers have found that these touch screens are vulnerable
15:23.020 - 15:27.880:  to a similar kind of attack where the different bumps and sounds coming from you typing on that
15:27.880 - 15:33.420:  touch screen are detectable within the microphones of your phone. But in your experiment, you found that
15:33.740 - 15:39.320:  if someone was typing away and you had this computer listening in, it would more or less know
15:39.320 - 15:46.200:  what is being typed. So the way our experiment works is you take a bunch of random recordings of
15:46.200 - 15:54.340:  these keystrokes. And yeah, given that that bunch of random data, it was able to predict 95% of
15:54.340 - 16:00.020:  those keys. What we're trying to show with paper or what this paper does show is that specifically
16:00.020 - 16:05.980:  machine learning is provably quite good at this, better than other models that have been used in the
16:05.980 - 16:13.660:  past. And so the likelihood of someone being able to exploit these flaws, the flaws being the
16:13.660 - 16:19.240:  sound a keyboard makes, that likelihood does go up with this paper showing that progress.
16:20.020 - 16:22.260:  Software engineer Joshua Harrison.
16:25.100 - 16:31.820:  Still to come in the global news podcast. A few moments before the Cortez Pass, there was a massive
16:31.820 - 16:38.720:  sing-along people broke out into their own version of nothing compares to you. An update from Ireland
16:39.000 - 16:41.320:  on the funeral of singer Shenandoah Conner.
16:47.600 - 16:52.840:  Walking out into that stadium and everybody's there, there's just such a big crowd and so much family
16:52.840 - 16:58.580:  and noise. I remember growing up and watching the Olympics and realizing that, you know, one day
16:58.580 - 17:05.100:  this could be me. An event that the whole world recognizes to win was something I had never imagined.
17:06.860 - 17:12.480:  A podcast about the incredible journeys of Olympic and Paralympic athletes on the podium from the
17:12.480 - 17:16.400:  BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
17:20.140 - 17:24.820:  Hey, I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite of what Big Wireless does.
17:24.960 - 17:30.000:  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally, when they announce they'd be raising
17:30.000 - 17:35.180:  their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
17:35.460 - 17:40.460:  That's right, we're cutting the price of Mint Unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.
17:40.900 - 17:43.400:  Give it a try at MintMobile.com slash switch.
17:43.780 - 17:46.720:  New activation and upfront payment for three month plan required. Taxes and fees extra.

17:54.380 - 17:58.700:  Niger was a key ally of the United States until last month's coup.
17:58.700 - 18:03.100:  The seventh military takeover in West and Central Africa since 2020.
18:03.820 - 18:08.200:  It comes as the Russian mercenary group Wagner stepped up activity in the region.
18:08.240 - 18:10.380:  It's been courting several African governments.
18:10.380 - 18:16.140:  The United States sent a top official Victoria Newland to Nigeria to try to pave the way
18:16.140 - 18:21.820:  for a restoration of democracy. But after talks, she said no progress had been made.
18:21.820 - 18:27.440:  The BBC's where he get Moira spoke to her boss, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken,
18:27.840 - 18:32.640:  and began by asking him if the site of Russian flags on the streets of the capital,
18:32.640 - 18:34.940:  Niami, was of concern to the US.
18:35.860 - 18:41.380:  For sure, we have concerns when we see something like the Wagner group possibly manifesting itself
18:42.020 - 18:45.400:  in different parts of the Sahel. And here's why we're concerned.
18:45.400 - 18:51.440:  Because every single place that this group, Wagner group, has gone death, destruction,
18:51.440 - 18:55.420:  and exploitation have followed. Insecurity has gone up, not down.
18:55.420 - 19:00.640:  It hasn't been a response to the needs of the countries in question for greater security.
19:01.200 - 19:08.820:  I think what happened and what continues to happen in Niger was not instigated by Russia
19:08.820 - 19:12.140:  by Wagner, but to the extent that they try to take advantage of it.
19:12.560 - 19:14.640:  And we see a repeat of what's happened in other countries,
19:15.100 - 19:17.940:  where they brought nothing but bad things in their wake. That wouldn't be good.
19:18.320 - 19:22.040:  Would your troops, with the troops of the US stay in Niger if the coup holds?
19:22.640 - 19:26.860:  Well, I don't want to get into hypotheticals. We get ahead of what's happening in Niger.
19:27.500 - 19:33.760:  We strongly support the work that ECOWAS is doing to try to help restore the constitutional order.
19:34.440 - 19:39.380:  In Niger, I've been in close touch with President Basum, with many colleagues in the region,
19:39.380 - 19:43.340:  including the Nigerian President Tsynubu, colleagues at the African Union.
19:44.560 - 19:49.600:  And it's very important that that constitutional order be restored.
19:50.880 - 19:56.660:  And right now, I think ECOWAS is playing an important role in moving the country back in that
19:56.660 - 20:00.460:  direction. Secretary of State, for those who support the halting of the Black Sea,
20:00.460 - 20:05.900:  grain deal, or I really look at it. They argue that the West is mainly concerned about Russia's
20:06.220 - 20:10.300:  growing influence over Africa. And the issue isn't just about food supply bearing in mind,
20:10.300 - 20:16.280:  only 3% of Ukraine's grain actually got to the African continent. Do you have any views on that?
20:16.280 - 20:21.680:  Well, again, the majority of the grain that was getting out through the Black Sea grain initiative,
20:22.320 - 20:26.200:  more than 50% was going to develop in countries, including many in Africa,
20:26.520 - 20:30.080:  two-thirds of the wheat going to develop in countries, including countries in Africa.
20:30.640 - 20:35.120:  But meanwhile, what's so important is this, resolving this situation,
20:35.120 - 20:40.840:  Russia getting back into the Black Sea grain initiative, would be the quickest thing anyone could do
20:40.840 - 20:47.780:  to actually effectively address food insecurity. The U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken.
20:49.400 - 20:54.040:  Spiritual healing is very popular in many countries in the Middle East, but there have been
20:54.040 - 21:00.160:  concerns as the practice is not regulated. Now, a BBC News Arabic investigation has uncovered
21:00.160 - 21:06.600:  allegations of widespread sexual abuse and coercion by spiritual healers in Sudan and Morocco,
21:06.620 - 21:13.640:  80 women accused healers of offenses, including rape, sexual assault, and manipulating them into sex.
21:14.120 - 21:19.740:  Hanan Razek visited Sudan before the recent conflict and sent this report, which contains
21:19.740 - 21:22.980:  distressing details of sexual abuse and violence.
21:27.400 - 21:33.200:  At this centre in Khartoum, women believe that spiritual healing can cure illnesses and
21:33.200 - 21:36.640:  solve emotional problems while expelling evil spirits.
21:39.480 - 21:45.600:  Shaykh Fautama is one of the few women who works as a healer. The practice is unregulated.
21:46.440 - 21:50.440:  She says many of the women she sees have been sexually exploited.
21:53.060 - 21:57.020:  Many women told us that part of the treatment involved the Shaykh or healer,
21:57.420 - 22:03.380:  touching part of their body, out of 100 women undoubtedly a quarter of them
22:03.480 - 22:08.940:  would have been sexually abused. One of the women Shaykh Fautama has helped is Sousa.
22:09.620 - 22:15.460:  He said he would have sex with me and used the resulting body fluids to concoct
22:15.460 - 22:19.380:  a potion I should feed to my husband. He said this is the treatment.
22:20.560 - 22:25.540:  In the first investigation of its kind, we spent months verifying stories of abuse.
22:26.520 - 22:34.020:  50 women in Sudan accused 40 healers of harassment, assault, and manipulating them into sex.
22:34.440 - 22:40.840:  Afef is one of those women. She went to a healer called Shaykh Brahim to help with her son's
22:41.760 - 22:49.020:  illness. I saw his shadow behind me, then he grobbed me. When he approached me, I swore to God
22:49.020 - 22:53.820:  I would scream and alert his children. I took his hands off me and I left.
22:54.820 - 23:00.340:  After hearing accounts from two other women, we sent an undercover journalist to visit the healer.
23:01.180 - 23:04.060:  While we were speaking, I suddenly found him next to me.
23:06.060 - 23:09.500:  I'll do prayers and recite 5,000 times over prayer beads.
23:10.240 - 23:16.000:  He put his hand on my thigh. I pushed his hand away. Then he put his hand on my stomach
23:16.640 - 23:19.180:  and pushed one of his fingers all the way down.
23:22.600 - 23:24.360:  With that touch, I got up and left.
23:30.360 - 23:35.220:  We contacted Shaykh Brahim to put our allegations to him and he agreed to be interviewed.
23:36.500 - 23:40.640:  I asked him if he had ever tried to have sex with women who had come for treatment.
23:42.180 - 23:44.400:  Only treatment. I only do treatment.
23:44.700 - 23:49.540:  What about our evidence that he had sexually assaulted women, including our own journalist?
23:50.640 - 23:54.280:  No, no. That didn't happen. God will hold her accountable for that.
23:55.140 - 23:57.420:  Then, he abruptly ended the interview.
23:58.520 - 24:03.180:  We brought our evidence to Alaydin Abuzid and advisor to the Islamic Affairs Ministry.
24:04.560 - 24:09.480:  It's become a profession for those who have no profession. We don't deny there are sexual
24:09.480 - 24:15.380:  anomalies. We undoubtedly support treatment with the Quran, but in the current form, it's chaos.
24:16.360 - 24:21.200:  With no help coming from the authorities for women like our 5th, she has her own advice.
24:22.740 - 24:26.620:  I tell them to forget about the healer and to solve their problems in another way.
24:27.980 - 24:30.280:  That's report by Hanan Razek.
24:31.360 - 24:37.740:  In 1959, the Soviet Union made history with the first uncrewed landing on the moon.
24:43.360 - 24:48.000:  Soviet Russia scores a dramatic victory in the exploration of space with the launching of
24:48.000 - 24:53.480:  the first rocket to hit the wall and historic scientific peak, bearing the Soviet court of arms
24:53.480 - 24:57.460:  and hammer and sickle penance in travel 35 hours through space.
24:58.080 - 25:04.200:  More than 60 years later, Russia is hoping to return to the moon. The lunar 25 lander,
25:04.200 - 25:10.620:  which is due to launch on Friday, aims to take and analyze soil samples and conduct long-term
25:10.620 - 25:15.920:  scientific research. Originally, the project was to have been a joint venture with the European
25:15.920 - 25:21.460:  Space Agency, but all cooperation with Moscow was ended following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
25:21.460 - 25:26.420:  Thomas Harsensky works for the European Space Policy Institute.
25:26.980 - 25:31.580:  Gary Adonahu asked him why Russia was returning to the lunar surface now.
25:32.600 - 25:36.900:  I would say it's not the program or the mission itself is not really a new development.
25:36.900 - 25:43.280:  As often in the space sector, the missions, especially missions that are really ambitious that
25:43.280 - 25:49.100:  go maybe to other celestial bodies, take years to emerge from the initial idea to the actual
25:49.180 - 25:54.740:  launch of the mission. I suppose going to the moon is in space terms a bit of a sort of muscle
25:54.740 - 25:59.700:  flex, isn't it? It's what countries want to do when they want to prove their space credentials.
25:59.700 - 26:07.420:  I would argue that it is becoming such again. For maybe the 10, 20, 30 years, if you look to the past,
26:07.840 - 26:12.480:  we haven't really seen so much activity. I mean, we can say that it has been done in the past,
26:12.480 - 26:16.580:  like with the US, with the Soviets, but it's still not that easy to go to the moon to
26:16.580 - 26:22.200:  softly land there. There has still been some unsuccessful tries, for instance, with some of the
26:22.200 - 26:27.720:  recent missions like the Israeli mission or the recent private landing mission by the ice space
26:27.720 - 26:33.460:  company. But yes, you're right in the sense of it has sort of become again kind of a matter of
26:33.460 - 26:38.080:  a prestige. The technological advancements in the sector have driven down the cost of
26:38.120 - 26:42.960:  accessing space or flying to space or purchasing space technologies, which basically opens up
26:43.640 - 26:49.180:  the possibilities of such ambitious and costly endeavors also to some smaller actors. And yes,
26:49.220 - 26:53.760:  indeed, we are seeing that more countries and especially smaller countries are now going
26:53.760 - 26:59.020:  back to the moon. It's an interesting decision for them to press ahead with this at a time where
26:59.460 - 27:05.880:  money must be short politically inside Russia with them fighting the war in Ukraine and all that.
27:05.880 - 27:12.540:  Is the space program in Russia well-funded? In the past, maybe 10, 15 years, what has really
27:12.540 - 27:18.480:  kind of a surface in terms of a space news or space policy from Russia has not really been
27:18.920 - 27:25.440:  good news. There has been a lot of indications of a very strong presence of corruption in the
27:25.440 - 27:30.800:  Russian space agency. It has changed its structure several times. The leaderships have changed.
27:30.960 - 27:34.560:  This is clearly a signal that something is not right in the Russian space program.
27:34.740 - 27:39.920:  A Russian space program have not been able to kind of sustain the levels of investments when
27:39.920 - 27:45.420:  you compare to the GDP or to the overall public expenditure, as it has been during the Soviet era.
27:45.540 - 27:49.980:  And more recently, there have been a game, some budget cut. But what we have clearly seen is that
27:49.980 - 27:54.700:  the achievements that the Soviet Union has been successful in achieving in the past,
27:55.040 - 27:59.540:  Russia has not been able to repeat it in the past few years. And I think that is really signaling
27:59.540 - 28:04.980:  that the Russian space program has not been able to sustain the excellence compared to the Soviet
28:04.980 - 28:10.600:  program in the Cold War. Thomas Rzezinski from the European Space Policy Institute.
28:11.720 - 28:17.460:  The Vaketa Purpose found on Mexico's Pacific coast is on the verge of extinction, with only
28:17.460 - 28:23.920:  around 10 animals still surviving. The Vaketa is the smallest of all the purposes, similar to dolphins,
28:23.920 - 28:29.220:  but with shorter beaks and more rounded bodies. Now, the International Wailing Commission has
28:29.220 - 28:35.620:  issued the first extinction alert in its 70-year history to one of the danger facing the Vaketa.
28:36.060 - 28:38.520:  I spoke to our science correspondent Helen Briggs.
28:39.660 - 28:46.720:  The main problem for the Vaketa is entanglement in Gilnet. So these are these flat fishing nets
28:46.720 - 28:53.280:  suspended vertically in the water. Now, fishing with Gilnet has been banned in Mexico
28:54.220 - 29:00.240:  but illegal Gilnet fishing goes on and that's driven by the high-prices poachers can get for
29:00.240 - 29:06.000:  an endangered fish called the Tatoba prize for its swim bladder in Chinese medicine
29:06.640 - 29:13.760:  and sold for vast profits on the black market. So there are efforts to clamp down on illegal
29:13.760 - 29:19.660:  Gilnet fishing. Last year, for example, the Mexican Navy placed concrete blocks in an area
29:20.100 - 29:25.760:  to try and stop this Gilnet fishing and increased enforcement efforts. But there are questions
29:25.760 - 29:32.100:  over whether enough is being done and diplomatic tensions over this between the US and Mexico
29:32.720 - 29:38.000:  and also concerns by sighties, the body that regulates trade in endangered species.
29:38.360 - 29:44.260:  Yeah, poachers notoriously tend to care very little about issues like this. So there are any
29:44.260 - 29:49.620:  reasons to think that the Vaketa purpose isn't going to be gone within fairly short time.
29:49.880 - 29:56.000:  This message from the IWC, the International Wailing Commission, does speak of a grim future
29:56.000 - 30:02.560:  for this creature. But it says it's speaking out now because it believes extinction is not yet
30:02.560 - 30:10.260:  inevitable. So there is a glimmer of hope and scientists a few years back did actually do some
30:10.260 - 30:17.200:  DNA testing on samples of these purposes and they reckon that actually there is enough genetic
30:17.200 - 30:22.800:  diversity in this population, even though it's down to 10. If you were to be able to stop this
30:22.800 - 30:28.380:  fishing and the population were able to recover naturally, there's no reason why it couldn't
30:28.380 - 30:36.960:  bounce back. But increasing concerns about whales, dolphins, purposes, the cetaceans and the IWC
30:37.400 - 30:42.860:  so acting now to highlight some of these extinction threats. And I think we're likely to see more
30:42.860 - 30:49.720:  of these warnings from the IWC. Helen Briggs. Ireland has been saying farewell to the singer
30:49.720 - 30:54.840:  Shenado Conner on the day she was buried. The streets of the town of Bray were filled with crowds
30:54.840 - 31:00.640:  paying their respects. Our reporter Sarah Gervin was among them. Despite her international
31:00.640 - 31:07.440:  stardom, Shenado Conner was part of the community in this seaside town for 15 years. Today that
31:07.440 - 31:13.480:  community turned out to mourn, celebrate and honour her as a singer and as an activist.
31:18.620 - 31:24.980:  The thoisons of fans who lined the root of her final journey sang and danced as her greatest
31:24.980 - 31:31.960:  hits blasted out from a van decked in floors and pride flags as her funeral court hedge passed by
31:31.960 - 31:38.880:  her former home they fell silent. But just for a moment, before Uplaw's broke out. After that,
31:38.880 - 31:44.540:  a private burial at the end of a life live for so many years in the public gaze.
31:46.540 - 31:47.560:  Sarah Gervin.
31:50.840 - 31:56.300:  And that's all from us for now. But there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast.
31:56.300 - 32:01.100:  Later, if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
