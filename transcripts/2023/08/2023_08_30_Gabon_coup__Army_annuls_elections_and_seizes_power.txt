01:10.540 - 01:17.300:  I'm Nigel Adely and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 30th of August, these are our main stories.
01:18.100 - 01:23.540:  The president of Caban is reported to be under house arrest after army officers seized power.
01:24.200 - 01:28.720:  Thousands have fled the Gulf Coast of Florida as Hurricane Adalia makes landfall.
01:31.920 - 01:32.860:  Also in this podcast.
01:44.060 - 01:48.600:  As Cruz missiles hit key and Ukrainian drone strikes cause damage across Russia,
01:49.160 - 01:51.540:  we hear about life on the eastern front line.
01:55.380 - 02:01.040:  We start this podcast with news of another coup in West Africa, where Gabon's president Ali
02:01.040 - 02:06.160:  Bongo was declared the winner of Saturday's election at 4am local time this morning,
02:06.720 - 02:12.560:  but within an hour the military moved in. An unidentified spokesman read out a statement
02:13.300 - 02:14.820:  surrounded by other men in uniform.
02:15.560 - 02:22.380:  In the name of the people of Gabon and as guarantors of the institutions,
02:23.140 - 02:28.860:  we have decided to defend peace by putting an end to the current regime,
02:29.660 - 02:36.640:  to descend the general elections of the 26th of August 2023 and the truncated results
02:37.100 - 02:44.100:  are cancelled. The borders are closed until further notice. All the institutions of the
02:44.100 - 02:51.860:  Republic are dissolved. The president of Gabon Ali Bongo is reported to be under house arrest
02:52.540 - 02:56.280:  and on the streets of the capital Libraville, there were scenes of jubilation.
03:07.060 - 03:13.020:  So celebrations there, but how has the news gone down elsewhere? A question for our correspondents
03:13.020 - 03:19.240:  in the region, Will Ross? It's often difficult to gauge the overall popularity
03:19.240 - 03:26.920:  from what happens quickly on the streets, but certainly people I've spoken to and from the
03:26.920 - 03:33.900:  videos that are circulating, there is genuine joy at the news that the president has been
03:33.900 - 03:41.260:  ousted. Avacus we've seen in West Africa, Central Africa have seen, you know, what to
03:42.180 - 03:46.020:  some eyes look a bit like sort of orchestrated shows of support where
03:47.600 - 03:52.180:  renter crowds are kind of brought out or at least persuaded to come out and show their support.
03:52.180 - 03:59.080:  Whereas in this case you're seeing men and women and quite a lot of support. There's also been
03:59.080 - 04:08.280:  an interesting development in that a video which appears to show the detained president Ali Bongo
04:08.280 - 04:15.580:  making an appeal in a short video for there to be lots of noise made about his predicament and
04:15.580 - 04:20.700:  saying that he's been arrested and his wife's being held in a different place. We haven't
04:20.700 - 04:28.360:  independently verified that video, but it certainly seems to be a video of the deposed president
04:28.360 - 04:34.280:  making that appeal for there to be, you know, a lot of noise made around the world and presumably
04:34.280 - 04:39.480:  to try and get support from from international bodies. And this the latest in a series of
04:39.480 - 04:45.080:  coups in the region, what is the impact? Yes, you're right. I mean, the eighth in Western Central
04:45.080 - 04:53.260:  Africa since 2020. I think it's going to be slightly different, I think, from other ones. I mean,
04:53.260 - 05:01.040:  we had the coup in Niger just last month. And that one, you know, was in a country where
05:01.800 - 05:06.120:  there was some support for the president and some support for the opposition. You know, you could
05:06.120 - 05:12.700:  say it was fairly split. So you would get some people celebrating a seizure of power there.
05:13.860 - 05:20.120:  But in this case, I think there is, you know, a great deal of anger at the way that the election
05:20.120 - 05:28.300:  was conducted. It produced a winner, Ali Bongo, with a roughly two thirds of the votes.
05:29.780 - 05:35.460:  But, you know, it definitely wasn't a level playing field. The opposition says it was a complete
05:35.460 - 05:40.800:  sham. And the fact that the internet had been shut off observers and journalists barred from
05:40.800 - 05:46.340:  reporting on it, you know, pretty suspicious signs. So a bit of a dilemma for the international
05:46.340 - 05:53.900:  community now. I know that the commonwealth of which Gaborne is now a member, and France,
05:53.900 - 05:59.740:  and China, and the EU have sort of expressed their concern. France has condemned the coup and called
05:59.740 - 06:07.960:  for President Bongo to be reinstated. But I think they'll find these messages of anger at the
06:08.020 - 06:12.500:  coup and calling for any kind of reinstatement will go down very badly in Gaborne itself.
06:13.420 - 06:19.800:  Will Ross. Evacuation orders are in force in more than 20 counties in the US state of Florida,
06:20.520 - 06:26.640:  where Hurricane Adalia is causing chaos. It's now developed into an extremely powerful storm,
06:27.240 - 06:33.620:  fueled by the unusually warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. A storm surge of up to five meters high
06:33.620 - 06:39.260:  along the Gulf Coast is predicted. In a news conference repeatedly interrupted by power failures,
06:39.860 - 06:45.680:  the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, urged people to take it seriously and avoid taking risks.
06:46.480 - 06:50.620:  It is a major hurricane. As we've been saying, it was likely to be for the last couple days,
06:51.180 - 06:58.680:  and we just hope everybody stays safe. Don't put your life at risk by doing anything dumb at this
06:58.700 - 07:04.480:  point. This thing's powerful. If you're inside, just hunker down until it gets past you,
07:05.140 - 07:08.540:  you don't want to be messing around with these winds. There's going to be things flying all over
07:08.540 - 07:13.580:  the place. Obviously, if you're in a place that's close to the coast and you see that surge,
07:13.580 - 07:18.500:  that's going to be legitimate surge. It's going to be a big, big deal, and it's going to be very,
07:18.500 - 07:24.200:  very dangerous. Reed Timmer is what's termed a storm chaser. He works for the commercial
07:24.200 - 07:30.780:  forecaster, AccuWeather. He's in C DeKey, an island city off the northwest coast of Florida
07:31.180 - 07:34.480:  in the Gulf of Mexico, and he told me what conditions were like.
07:35.280 - 07:39.920:  Yeah, we have a life threatening storm surge here in Cedar Key, Florida right now. It's about
07:39.920 - 07:46.000:  six to eight feet of water waves on top of that, and I feel a lot of debris, a lot of destroyed
07:46.000 - 07:51.880:  structures, inundated by flood water. And I actually see a floating septic tank going by right now,
07:51.880 - 07:56.500:  just floating down the main street here of Cedar Key. So it's just a heartbreaking
07:56.500 - 08:02.480:  save here along the coastline. I'm presumably everybody else now has cleared the area.
08:02.960 - 08:06.440:  Yes, yeah, everybody's out of the area. There's just a couple of people here. There were
08:06.440 - 08:11.640:  some emergency people that have retreated to higher ground. So everybody is just hunkering down
08:11.640 - 08:16.580:  on high ground right now, waiting for these floodwaters to receive. But a major storm surge here
08:16.580 - 08:21.800:  wins probably $89,000 an hour and goes. A when do you think this could reach its peak?
08:22.240 - 08:27.500:  I think it's not as peaking right about now, I would say here in Cedar Key in terms of the storm
08:27.500 - 08:31.020:  surge. And as it's coming ashore, we're going to continue with these west release up through
08:31.020 - 08:35.280:  high tide, where the flooding's likely to continue for a couple more hours and hopefully it'll
08:35.280 - 08:41.340:  receive shortly after that. And how bad is this compared to other storms you've seen in the area?
08:41.920 - 08:46.780:  It's pretty bad, but in this area, it's about as bad as it's ever gotten since like the 1800s,
08:46.780 - 08:51.100:  in terms of having a storm that's powerful up here, in terms of like a hurricane.
08:51.100 - 08:56.980:  In, for example, last year, just terribly devastating. That was a high end category four. So
08:56.980 - 09:03.420:  every storm is different in terms of their impact. This one is as unique in terms of the record
09:03.420 - 09:08.220:  breaking storm surge and the flooding and the structures that are getting inundated by the floodwaters.
09:08.800 - 09:14.980:  Reed Timmer, a storm chaser in Florida. The drone attacks by Ukraine are reaching deep
09:14.980 - 09:20.880:  into Russian territory. Russia's military said it had shot down Ukrainian drones over several regions,
09:20.940 - 09:27.960:  including Moscow, Briansk, Kaluga, Oyal, and Ryazam. In the northwest city of Paskov,
09:27.960 - 09:33.040:  near the Estonian border, two cargo planes were hit in an attack on the airport.
09:33.040 - 09:37.620:  The regional governor Mikhail Verenikov gave this update to reporters.
09:39.580 - 09:46.240:  A drone attack was repelled at the airport. No casualties, thank God. The scope of the damage is
09:46.240 - 09:52.140:  now being checked. All services are on sight. We held an emergency staff meeting and outlined
09:52.140 - 09:57.520:  the first actions. Meanwhile, Russia has attacked the Ukrainian capital with cruise missiles.
09:58.220 - 10:03.840:  The mayor of Kiev says two people have been killed and another wounded in the latest Russian air attack.
10:09.480 - 10:13.540:  So aerial attacks on both sides. But how significant are they?
10:14.020 - 10:19.060:  I asked our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg what damage the Ukrainian drone attacks had done.
10:20.040 - 10:25.220:  In a sense, this follows a pattern. In recent weeks, we've seen an increase in the number of drone
10:25.220 - 10:32.500:  attacks across Russia and sometimes deep inside Russian territory. What we've been seeing over
10:32.500 - 10:39.700:  the last few hours is a particularly large-scale drone attack targeting six regions of Russia and
10:39.700 - 10:44.620:  also Russian occupied Crimea. It's not clear how much damage has been done by the attacks. I mean,
10:44.620 - 10:48.560:  the Russians say that most of the drones have been shot down by Russian air defense systems.
10:49.100 - 10:55.180:  But the most significant attack appears to have been in Paskov. That's in northwestern Russia.
10:55.860 - 11:00.400:  An airfield, an airport there has been attacked. Initially, Russian officials said that four
11:00.400 - 11:06.200:  military transport planes had been damaged. That was later revised down to two. Another of the
11:06.200 - 11:12.440:  regions that's been targeted is Blyansk region, that borders Ukraine. And according to reports this
11:12.440 - 11:17.860:  morning, drone attacks have continued there in the morning. The local TV tower is targeted,
11:17.860 - 11:23.900:  although apparently not damaged in a drone attack. And Russia said when this conflict started that
11:23.900 - 11:31.340:  its main issue was to protect the security of its people. Do the Russian people feel safer with
11:31.340 - 11:36.280:  all these drone attacks? Yeah, it's a key question. You're absolutely right. There is an irony here
11:36.280 - 11:41.660:  because when President Putin launched the so-called special military operation a year and a half ago,
11:41.660 - 11:46.460:  the Kremlin did say that there was a need to boost Russia's national security. The Kremlin claimed
11:46.460 - 11:52.980:  that Russia was threatened by Ukraine, by America, by NATO, by the West in general. But in fact,
11:52.980 - 11:58.560:  what's happened is that Russia's now more insecure, the Russian people are more insecure than they
11:58.560 - 12:05.080:  were a year and a half ago. Does that mean that the population here has joined the dots and concluded
12:05.080 - 12:11.140:  that this insecurity is a result of the invasion? I don't think that's happened yet. No, partly because
12:11.140 - 12:18.160:  of the propaganda in the state media here, which from morning till night tells Russians that what
12:18.160 - 12:24.820:  is happening today is a result of external threats. That Russia is a besieged fortress being threatened
12:24.820 - 12:32.280:  by external forces. So in the sense these continuing drone attacks play into the Kremlin's narrative
12:32.280 - 12:39.000:  that it has created, that Russia is the victim and is threatened by enemies abroad. Steve Rosenberg
12:39.780 - 12:45.460:  The air raids came as Ukraine's much-reported counter-offensive move slowly in the south, although
12:45.460 - 12:51.100:  the fighting is intensifying in the east, where Russia has renewed its attacks with an estimated
12:51.100 - 12:57.480:  tens of thousands of men. For now, Ukraine's advances are modest, but they are costing lives.
12:58.260 - 13:03.680:  The BBC's Quentin Somerville spent the past month with Ukrainian brigades fighting in the area.
13:05.420 - 13:12.080:  That's what the area is covered in the craters, trees have been turned into matchsticks.
13:14.620 - 13:19.920:  Inters a hellish landscape, everything's burning, and the flames outside of the road.
13:20.720 - 13:24.480:  Before one screen, I can't see anything, there's a vehicle and a trunk, because it's checking
13:24.520 - 13:29.740:  out all mighty clouds of dust. Of course, the washing drones will be there to see that too.
13:51.540 - 13:57.300:  The gunner has fallen inside from his turret. He signals that he's unhurt, but the fireball
13:57.300 - 14:02.980:  about a meter in front of the vehicle wasn't from a grenade. It was a kamikaze drone,
14:03.400 - 14:08.160:  as the battalion commander, with a coal-signed speaker, explains from the passenger seat.
14:35.380 - 14:43.080:  So, we've had to stop going forward. It's the danger here, the deeper you get into the forest,
14:44.140 - 14:47.380:  cover doesn't get better. It's constant Russian artillery,
14:47.380 - 14:53.360:  seeing some of the trees on fire, the drones up above. Battles across the eastern front
14:53.360 - 15:00.160:  have reignited. Ukraine says it's now the hottest front, with some 100,000 Russian troops
15:00.160 - 15:06.420:  deployed in new battle groups. This is the problem facing Ukraine at the moment. It's moving forward
15:06.420 - 15:13.140:  in the south of the country a bit by bit. It's counteroffensive. Here in the east,
15:14.600 - 15:19.660:  there's Russia that's on the attack. They've been losing ground here, and all of this means that
15:20.300 - 15:26.640:  those limited Ukrainian resources are being stretched, manpower and equipment to breaking point.
15:28.340 - 15:34.200:  The Russian gains for now are modest, but around could be asked a city recaptured in September
15:34.200 - 15:40.580:  from the Russians last year. It's about 25 miles from the border. Civilians are again within
15:40.580 - 15:47.940:  range of Russian guns. Evacuation orders have been issued. 72-year-old Antonina Semenevna
15:47.940 - 15:56.400:  lived under Russian occupation for six months and says she won't again. What do you think?
15:56.760 - 16:03.540:  Will there be anything good? I don't know anything. How it keeps booming and booming and booming and
16:03.820 - 16:10.000:  booming if only they could chase them away from here so that they would be further away at least.
16:11.520 - 16:17.200:  Russia's military gains don't add up to much yet, but for Antonina and others, they mean everything.
16:18.720 - 16:20.300:  Quentin Somerville in Ukraine.
16:23.180 - 16:28.060:  Still to come on this podcast. They look and feel just like you're every day clothing,
16:28.120 - 16:35.380:  but in this case we're using pressurized air to apply forces to the body from within the fabric
16:35.380 - 16:41.900:  we're basically allowing this extra communicative channel. How your t-shirt could one day be giving

16:54.280 - 16:58.720:  Olympic Games was in 1980. Everybody's been seeing me run for years growing up.

17:21.640 - 17:25.600:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
17:25.760 - 17:31.540:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire takes one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
17:31.540 - 17:35.960:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
17:36.100 - 17:39.460:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims,
17:39.780 - 17:44.460:  or what Jeff Bezos really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred
17:44.460 - 17:49.100:  billion dollars, listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me Simon Jack and me Zingsing.

17:57.880 - 18:03.360:  Welcome back to the Global News podcast. Australia is to hold a constitutional referendum
18:03.360 - 18:08.760:  on the 14th of October on whether to recognise its Indigenous people for the first time.
18:09.360 - 18:13.540:  The Prime Minister Anthony Albinace has urged Australians to vote yes.
18:14.460 - 18:22.280:  Constitutional recognition through a voice away for all of us to recognise Indigenous Australians
18:22.380 - 18:30.160:  and their history in our constitution. And a form of recognition that will importantly make
18:30.160 - 18:36.960:  a positive difference to their lives and their futures. Success would also enshrine the
18:36.960 - 18:42.860:  right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait people to be consulted on laws that impact on their communities.
18:43.740 - 18:48.580:  But the yes vote is trailing in the polls and there are fears that failure to approve the
18:48.580 - 18:54.620:  referendum could harm racial relations in Australia. Our correspondent Phil Mercer is in Sydney.
18:55.260 - 19:02.220:  The note campaign is a broad church of various groups and they have many complaints about
19:02.220 - 19:09.360:  the government's proposal to recognise Australia's Indigenous peoples in the constitution by setting
19:09.360 - 19:15.960:  up a so-called voice to parliament, an independent panel that would advise governments and MPs
19:16.300 - 19:23.160:  on laws and policies. Now those critics say that the whole proposal for the Indigenous
19:23.160 - 19:29.840:  voice really presumes that Australia's original inhabitants will always be disadvantaged and will
19:29.840 - 19:36.940:  always need a permanent voice at the heart of Australia's federal parliament to other critics say
19:36.940 - 19:43.800:  that this is a white elitist project that it's paternalistic essentially telling Indigenous people
19:43.800 - 19:50.900:  what's good for them. So other critics say that the detail around the power and the role of this
19:50.900 - 19:56.760:  panel is a bit vague and as a result the opinion polls are suggesting that the government here
19:56.760 - 20:04.560:  does have an uphill battle to convince voters to say yes on October the 14th. Anthony Albanese
20:04.560 - 20:11.120:  believes that the voice to parliament would be a practical and positive way to improve the lives
20:11.120 - 20:17.880:  of Indigenous people. They make up 3% of Australia's population but they suffer very high rates
20:17.880 - 20:25.560:  of poverty, unemployment and imprisonment. Phil Mercer in Sydney. On the global news podcast
20:25.560 - 20:31.660:  we aim to look into stories suggested by you and one listener has emailed to us for an update
20:31.660 - 20:37.460:  on a hunger strike by hundreds of prisoners in Bahrain. They've been on strike since early August
20:37.460 - 20:44.300:  to protest about their conditions. Many were detained in 2011 during mass anti-government protests
20:44.300 - 20:50.520:  by the majority sheer community. So I asked our Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher to tell us
20:50.520 - 20:54.740:  more about them. They see themselves as political prisoners as prisoners of conscience,
20:54.880 - 21:02.840:  there's estimated to be over a thousand held in Bahrain. This is in jail prison which also holds
21:02.840 - 21:10.000:  a lot of prisoners who are there for crime and the political prisoners say that they are treated
21:10.000 - 21:18.320:  far worse than the ordinary prisoners that they don't have as long outside. In fact they have a
21:18.320 - 21:23.220:  radically shorter time that they're allowed to exercise outside. The visitation rights from
21:23.220 - 21:30.260:  their families are restricted. Their medical care isn't administered properly. They don't have
21:30.260 - 21:36.120:  access to education and they don't have permission to pray together at a mosque in the prison.
21:36.120 - 21:42.260:  So all of these things have built up culminating in this decision earlier this month to stage
21:42.720 - 21:49.000:  what is according to activist in Bahrain the biggest ever hunger strike. I mean I've just been hearing
21:49.780 - 21:58.040:  from one of them just now who's saying that well over 800 prisoners are participating in this
21:58.040 - 22:02.600:  hunger strike strike now. I mean some of them have joined since it began more than three weeks ago.
22:03.200 - 22:08.280:  The authorities put the figure much lower. They have it I think around 120. So there's big
22:08.280 - 22:13.940:  discrepancies here but essentially these are people who see themselves as being imprisoned for
22:13.940 - 22:20.580:  political reasons but basically opposing the Bahrainian authorities and that their conditions
22:20.580 - 22:26.360:  are just not acceptable in prison. And the Bahrainian authorities have made some moves to answer
22:26.360 - 22:31.660:  their demands but do the prisoners believe it's too little too late? They have. I mean there have
22:31.660 - 22:37.060:  been meetings, there have been talks between the interior ministry and representatives of the
22:37.060 - 22:44.540:  prisoners. There was a statement from the interior ministry saying that they would allow more outdoor
22:44.540 - 22:51.420:  time. They would look at the duration of visits and at the list of visitors better allowed. Also
22:51.500 - 22:58.640:  phone calls, all of these things. What I've been hearing and what I've been told by activists here
22:58.640 - 23:04.720:  in the UK who are in contact pretty much all the time with prisoners there is that they've
23:04.720 - 23:09.220:  rejected this and they don't feel but it goes anywhere far enough for it's far too little too late.
23:09.640 - 23:14.860:  Our Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher there, answering one listener's request for an update
23:14.860 - 23:21.300:  on hunger strikes in Bahrain. And if you've got a story you'd like us to look into do get in touch.
23:21.300 - 23:28.480:  You can send us an email. The address is global podcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find
23:28.480 - 23:37.420:  us on x formerly known as Twitter at global news pod. In recent years social media has become
23:37.420 - 23:43.340:  an increasingly powerful tool in the hands of politicians prompting calls for tougher scrutiny.
23:44.120 - 23:51.520:  Now with a 2024 US election campaign gathering pace x formerly known as Twitter has announced
23:51.520 - 23:57.280:  it's lifting a ban on political advertising after nearly four years. Aniraz Lim reports.
23:58.160 - 24:01.120:  X has gone through a number of changes since it was taken over by the billionaire
24:01.120 - 24:07.700:  businessman Elon Musk last year. His predecessor Jack Dorsey banned political ads in 2019 saying
24:07.700 - 24:12.680:  that political message reach should be earned and not bought. In January though the platform
24:12.680 - 24:17.860:  relaxed the restrictions and began allowing cause-based ads in the US that raised awareness of
24:17.860 - 24:23.620:  issues such as voter registration. Now it's lifting the ban completely. The company said it was
24:23.620 - 24:28.600:  committed to free expression and didn't want a censor political debate but stressed that it would
24:28.600 - 24:34.280:  robustly screen and review the ads to prohibit content that spreads false information or seeks
24:34.280 - 24:39.920:  to undermine confidence in the election process. X also said it's expanding its safety and election
24:39.920 - 24:45.400:  teams which were heavily cut after Mr Musk took over. The move could have significant implications
24:45.400 - 24:51.500:  for the 2024 election and will help boost X's revenue. Political advertising online has recently
24:51.500 - 24:56.800:  become a contentious issue in the US especially after allegation surfaced that Russia used
24:56.800 - 25:02.860:  social media to spread this information ahead of the 2016 election. Political ads are now allowed
25:02.860 - 25:07.340:  on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube but are still banned on TikTok.
25:15.580 - 25:21.120:  Available to guide you to your destination. Holding your phone out in front of you can be a bit
25:21.120 - 25:28.460:  clunky and potentially attract unwanted attention. But scientists at Rice University in Houston, Texas
25:29.020 - 25:35.240:  have created a device which can feed the same information through your clothing. Dan Preston,
25:35.240 - 25:39.060:  an assistant professor of mechanical engineering is an author of the study.
25:39.980 - 25:44.900:  They look and feel just like your everyday clothing but in this case we've incorporated
25:45.400 - 25:49.900:  haptic cues, things that take advantage of your sense of touch to convey information.
25:50.380 - 25:57.220:  We're using pressurized air to apply forces to the body from within the fabric materials from
25:57.220 - 26:02.360:  which we're composing these wearables and garments. And so it feels like a gentle push on the body
26:02.800 - 26:09.460:  as we apply air pressure to the wearable. We've incorporated it in wristbands and sleeves and shirts.
26:10.200 - 26:15.860:  The actual region that applies force is a little bit bigger than a centimeter
26:15.900 - 26:21.820:  by a centimeter. But when we incorporate many of them they can cover the entire shirt or sleeve
26:21.820 - 26:27.700:  that we're using in this work. Our goal here was to actually try to address limitations in terms
26:27.700 - 26:32.280:  of, for example, about a billion people that have some partial or full loss of vision, maybe
26:32.280 - 26:36.680:  another one and a half billion people with a partial or full loss of hearing. So instead take
26:36.680 - 26:41.840:  advantage of their sense of touch by using this garment to apply forces or feelings of touch
26:42.240 - 26:48.460:  on the body. We're basically allowing this extra communicative channel. We started in the lab
26:48.460 - 26:54.000:  where we ran tests with human participants to determine whether or not we could convey information
26:54.640 - 26:59.380:  effectively. And we found that the users were successful about 90% of the time interpreting
26:59.380 - 27:04.480:  this information conveyed through touch. And then from there what we did was take it outside the lab,
27:04.520 - 27:10.020:  we used it to navigate throughout, in this case, the streets of Houston. We were giving
27:10.720 - 27:16.120:  haptic cues to tell people when to turn, when to go forward, when to stop. And we found that
27:16.120 - 27:20.900:  we had 100% success right there in terms of getting people to navigate with their hands free
27:21.120 - 27:27.120:  with this device. And if you imagine, for example, again, someone that may have limited hearing,
27:27.120 - 27:32.300:  maybe someone that wants to keep their eyes on the road, maybe the best way to tell them
27:32.480 - 27:39.020:  when to turn or when to proceed forward is to use some sort of a tactile or haptic cue. And so
27:39.020 - 27:43.660:  in this case, maybe your shirt instead of hearing some voice or looking at a screen and taking
27:43.660 - 27:48.360:  your eyes off the road, maybe your shirt or sleeve indicates to you when to turn.
27:49.260 - 27:56.440:  Dan Preston from Rice University in Texas. And that's all for us for now, but there will be a new
27:56.440 - 28:01.500:  addition of the Global News podcast later. This addition was mixed by Alicia Firsting
28:01.900 - 28:08.240:  and the producer was Rebecca Wood. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nigel Adely. Until next time,
28:08.600 - 28:08.820:  goodbye.
