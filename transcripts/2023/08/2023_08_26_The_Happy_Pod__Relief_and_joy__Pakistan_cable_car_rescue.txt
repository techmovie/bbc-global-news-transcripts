00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:20.640:  by advertising. That 56 seconds, it took me to swim that gold medal win. I looked for that feeling
00:20.640 - 00:28.180:  for 30 years and I never found it. A podcast about the people behind the medals.
00:29.020 - 00:34.240:  On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:37.280 - 00:42.420:  Bonjour, I'm Jeremy from Switzerland and you're listening to The HappyPod.
00:43.060 - 00:47.620:  Hi, I'm Eugene, yeah, from Free Terms Yolion and this is The HappyPod.
00:48.340 - 00:52.640:  Hello, I'm Lorna. If you want to hear my award-winning joke, keep listening to The HappyPod.
00:53.320 - 00:56.200:  This is The HappyPod from the BBC World Service.
01:02.180 - 01:07.940:  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 26th of August, the relief in Pakistan
01:07.940 - 01:13.420:  after six schoolboys and two adults were rescued from a cable car which was left dangling over
01:13.420 - 01:20.660:  a ravine when a cable snapped. After being rescued, I feel like I've got a new life. When I return
01:20.660 - 01:25.700:  to school, I will take the longer route along the riverside but will never use the cable car.
01:27.020 - 01:32.100:  The volunteers in Switzerland protecting livestock from wolves and wolves from people.
01:32.640 - 01:38.420:  The goal of our mission is to keep both the livestock and the wolves alive at the end of the season.
01:38.680 - 01:41.560:  And so far, we never lost any reason good animal.
01:42.560 - 01:46.320:  From India, the mother and son who passed their 10th grade exams together.
01:50.980 - 01:54.540:  He said, Mummy, you passed your exam. I had tears in my eyes.
01:55.640 - 01:56.840:  Also in the podcast.
02:02.400 - 02:07.520:  Some of the best things about the women's world cup and the funniest joke at the world's
02:07.560 - 02:08.540:  biggest arts festival.
02:15.040 - 02:19.540:  It was a daring rescue in Northern Pakistan that caught the attention of people around the
02:19.540 - 02:26.200:  world this week. Six school pupils and two adults trapped in a cable car dangling 300 metres
02:26.200 - 02:31.700:  up after one of the cables snapped. Once everyone had been brought to safety, we caught up with
02:31.700 - 02:36.340:  our Pakistan correspondent Carrie Davis to reflect on an extraordinary mission.
02:37.000 - 02:40.720:  The first reaction everybody had was this enormous sense of relief.
02:48.400 - 02:52.380:  And release really because everybody had been so tense and you can see the images of the
02:52.380 - 02:57.700:  six children and two adults who were on board the cable car and you can see quite literally how
02:57.720 - 03:01.620:  tense they have to be because they're hanging so precariously. So the fact that they'd all
03:01.620 - 03:07.140:  managed to make it back down to earth, I think amongst that as well, there seems to be a sense
03:07.140 - 03:12.120:  that quite a few of the school boys understandably were sort of stunned because all of this happened
03:12.120 - 03:16.420:  when they were just on their way to school. This was a relatively normal school commute. It might
03:16.420 - 03:21.820:  not be for most people how you'd get to school, but this is for them not that unusual.
03:22.380 - 03:28.100:  Something like this became a window for the world to see how other people live.
03:28.680 - 03:35.040:  Quite a lot of us would have seen that cable car and been absolutely astounded that for a whole
03:35.040 - 03:39.700:  load of kids, that's a normal start to their day. Yes, and I think a lot of people would see
03:39.700 - 03:42.980:  those images and thought, well, I would never get into something like that. But I think if you
03:42.980 - 03:48.480:  bear in mind how remote the areas that these children are living in and how normalised getting
03:48.480 - 03:54.480:  into a cable car that has just been built by a local mechanic to try to make things more accessible
03:54.480 - 03:58.820:  just becomes completely normal and also bear in mind that we've been told by locals that
03:58.820 - 04:03.460:  that cable car had already done four journeys that day and it was on the fifth one that the cable
04:03.460 - 04:09.800:  broke. To suddenly find themselves not just hanging precariously and surviving this 15 hour
04:09.800 - 04:14.920:  or deal, but then coming back down to earth, coming back into an enormous crowd of people that
04:14.920 - 04:19.580:  had been waiting and watching and willing them on, but also coming back into an international
04:20.260 - 04:24.760:  new story where people around the world had been watching what had happened to them. It's just
04:24.760 - 04:32.640:  pretty extraordinary. I thought today was our last day and perhaps it would be my final moment in life.
04:36.280 - 04:40.600:  After being rescued, I feel like I've got a new life. When I return to school,
04:41.120 - 04:45.180:  I will take the longer route along the riverside, but will never use the cable car.
04:45.180 - 04:48.040:  I said I'm James, definitely the one I'm the James.
04:48.640 - 04:53.880:  Carrie, you've been a reporter a long time. You've reported on all sorts of stories and I know
04:53.880 - 05:01.220:  that this one isn't about you, but what is it like to be there to witness and to report on something
05:01.220 - 05:06.980:  with such a positive outcome? You're right. I think a lot of stories do have negative sides to them.
05:06.980 - 05:10.360:  I've said it's quite nice sometimes when you've got a story that you're able to smile on air
05:10.360 - 05:16.660:  about because often they're quite rare. It's always lovely to be able to
05:17.280 - 05:23.640:  show people's excitement and joy and how people can pull together and that there can be this
05:23.640 - 05:28.520:  common sense, not just in Pakistan, but around the world, of relief, joy and happiness,
05:29.180 - 05:33.740:  that something that could have gone very terribly wrong has actually ended up for the best and
05:33.740 - 05:39.480:  everybody is back and safe. It can be nerve-wracking when just one member of your family is awaiting
05:39.480 - 05:45.720:  exam results, so spare a thought for Monica Casbeta-Lange and her teenage son Muntan in India
05:45.720 - 05:51.880:  who passed their 10th grade exam at the same time. Now in her 30s, Monica didn't get the chance
05:51.880 - 05:58.060:  to complete her education when she was a teenager. BBC Maratiko responded Rahul Rasubhe,
05:58.060 - 06:03.960:  covered the story of the studious mother and her son. His colleague, BBC reporter Amruta Duve
06:03.960 - 06:10.380:  and Mumbai told us more about her. Monica is a young mother. She has two children and she works as a
06:10.380 - 06:16.780:  sanitation worker in the city of Pune. As a kid, Monica loved going to school, but when she was in grade
06:16.780 - 06:22.540:  8, she had to cut short her education because her parents could not afford it and then she was
06:22.540 - 06:28.860:  married off very young and years later, she decided to appear for grade 10th exam along with her
06:28.860 - 06:35.780:  son Muntan. The results were declared online because that's the norm's details and Monica was so
06:35.780 - 06:42.600:  scared that she decided that she won't be checking the results on her own and Monica Muntan told her
06:42.600 - 06:53.520:  that, Mom, you passed. Can you believe it? He said, Mommy, you passed your exam. I had tears in my
06:53.660 - 06:59.680:  eyes. I didn't know if to cry or to smile. I've never experienced this happiness when I was in
06:59.680 - 07:05.560:  school or when my kids were in school. She's a widow as well as a single mother and she has work as
07:05.580 - 07:11.820:  well. How did she had the time to study for this exam? This actually started during the pandemic,
07:11.820 - 07:18.740:  during the Covid lockdowns and this is when both kids were doing online lessons and she used to
07:18.740 - 07:24.620:  listen to these classes and she used to love what she was hearing and that's when she started
07:24.620 - 07:30.140:  getting interested in it and she decided that when her son will be appearing for grade 10,
07:30.140 - 07:36.480:  she will also study along with him so they don't have to spend separately on the books. Her son
07:36.480 - 07:46.940:  Muntan helped boost Amural and he says he enjoyed studying with his mom. I used to come home after
07:47.300 - 07:52.980:  school by 530, have tea and snacks and then we used to study together, solve math songs, study
07:52.980 - 08:00.260:  science. It was fun. She had so many doubts but never gave up. Both Monica and Muntan passed Muntan
08:00.260 - 08:06.240:  scoring slightly higher than his mom did. Tell us a little bit about reaction to the story.
08:06.780 - 08:11.760:  He has been phenomenal. If people have been appreciating her, they have been encouraging her.
08:12.400 - 08:20.500:  Till now we have 97,000 views for this story on Facebook and 60% women engagement because this
08:20.500 - 08:27.280:  is something really inspirational. A single mother trying to find her way and trying to run her
08:27.280 - 08:33.640:  household in India, sanitation workers don't get paid much. She managed to do this.
08:34.000 - 08:39.700:  And what's next for her? She really wants to continue her education and let's hear what Monica
08:40.140 - 08:50.140:  says about her future. It's my dream to get educated. I couldn't do much till now but I'll learn
08:50.140 - 08:56.820:  as much as I can, not for anyone else but for myself. Our knowledge always remains with us.
08:58.360 - 09:05.780:  Monica Kazbeta Langay, congratulations to her and to Muntan. Once upon a time there was a big
09:05.780 - 09:12.780:  bad wolf. Wolves have long had a pretty bad press and their reestablishment in Europe hasn't been
09:12.780 - 09:17.580:  entirely without controversy. In Switzerland reports of attacks on livestock have
09:17.580 - 09:21.760:  soared and the authorities have relaxed the rules for hunting the protected species.
09:22.540 - 09:28.260:  So how can humans and wolves better share the countryside? Opal, the organisation for the
09:28.260 - 09:34.080:  protection of alpine pastures is trying to help. Jeremy Mula is its director.
09:34.900 - 09:40.800:  The goal of our missions is to try to keep both the livestock and the wolves alive at the end
09:40.800 - 09:46.100:  of the season and take the guard of the livestock during the night. So when the shepherds go to
09:46.100 - 09:51.300:  sleep they can really rest and we use volunteer to do night shifts around the livestock and take care
09:51.300 - 09:56.320:  of them and make sure that the wolves stay away from them. And what sorts of people are getting
09:56.320 - 10:02.060:  involved in these these shepherding night shifts? We have all kind of people. I would say we have
10:02.060 - 10:07.280:  biologists, photographers, we have also hunters that come to help people from all around the
10:07.280 - 10:12.700:  society. So it really includes all kind of people, very often people that don't have really the same
10:12.700 - 10:18.640:  ideas about the wolf. It can be very bad things and it can be very positive things, very romantic
10:18.640 - 10:23.380:  stories about the wolves and it brings them together as well. They can just do a night shift
10:23.380 - 10:28.540:  together and they can exchange ideas and they try to find solutions together and this I think
10:28.540 - 10:32.940:  creates some kind of collective intelligence that is very important for our project.
10:33.460 - 10:40.060:  The idea of sitting in the dark on a hillside where there are predators seems a little bit
10:40.060 - 10:45.180:  frightening and a little bit dangerous. What do they actually do? Of course they are wild animals so
10:45.180 - 10:52.280:  there's always a bit unpredictable part but since a few decades now there have not been really any
10:52.280 - 10:57.720:  attacks on a human in Europe and also there's a risk of being beaten by a beaver when you go to
10:57.720 - 11:03.020:  a swim in a lake. So you have to consider this risk but it's not really a decrease. So we provide
11:03.020 - 11:09.220:  the volunteers with different tools, different gears. We give them thermal vision binoculars so you
11:09.220 - 11:14.820:  can see the animals in the night and we also have powerful spotlights that we use when the wolves,
11:14.820 - 11:20.760:  when they approach too much and so far in all cases just by whistling, by screaming or by using
11:20.760 - 11:26.640:  the spotlights, it scares the wolves away. And what do the farmers think about this? Is it working?
11:27.160 - 11:32.360:  It's already the third year that we are doing this and until now at least the success is 100%
11:32.540 - 11:38.180:  and we never lost any single animal of course with the farmers, the collaboration are very,
11:38.180 - 11:44.420:  very good. So it's people who really need help and who need to find a solution. So yeah they're
11:44.420 - 11:51.680:  very happy about these collaborations. Jérémie Moulin of Opal. Now you might have noticed that some
11:51.680 - 11:56.540:  very talented women have been playing some very good football over the past few weeks. The women's
11:56.540 - 12:02.560:  World Cup ended with Spain winning the title for the first time in front of over 75,000 fans
12:02.560 - 12:07.740:  at Stadium Australia in Sydney. Their success brought the curtain down on a successful
12:07.740 - 12:12.780:  competition which showcased women's football to millions of new viewers around the world.
12:12.940 - 12:18.620:  The happy pod team turned to our very own football commentator Nigel Adelid for his run down
12:18.620 - 12:22.700:  of the main positives to take away from this year's women's World Cup.
12:27.240 - 12:33.080:  People. It's reported that the global television audience was around two billion,
12:33.720 - 12:39.060:  79% more than the previous tournament in France only four years ago.
12:40.000 - 12:52.840:  Fans. Stadiums were full as well. Over two million tickets sold. Supporters made huge sacrifices
12:52.840 - 12:58.380:  to attend a tournament which for some was thousands of kilometres from home. The average
12:58.380 - 13:04.960:  attendance across the 64 games was over 30,000. Another record shattered.
13:09.780 - 13:17.580:  Africa. For the first time in a men's or women's World Cup three African sites qualified for the
13:17.580 - 13:24.320:  knockout phase. Morocco helped to oust European giant Germany. South Africa won a dramatic match
13:24.320 - 13:31.740:  with Italy while Nigeria exited the tournament without losing a game after outplaying England for
13:31.740 - 13:44.120:  long spells but falling in a penalty shootout. New teams, new stars. It wasn't just the African
13:44.120 - 13:50.660:  teams who came to the party. Jamaica overcame huge logistical issues before the tournament to
13:50.720 - 13:55.700:  stun the legendary martyr and her brazil team by knocking them out in the group stage.
13:56.660 - 14:02.260:  Columbia won their group which included a remarkable victory over Germany and they also took
14:02.260 - 14:07.680:  England all the way in the quarterfinals. And although Haiti and Panama went home early,
14:08.280 - 14:11.360:  they showed enough to indicate they'll be better next time.
14:14.020 - 14:14.740:  Gold Keepers
14:17.340 - 14:22.860:  The quality of the number one in this tournament was a game-changer. England's Mary Erbs finished
14:22.860 - 14:29.180:  on the losing side in the final but won the Golden Glove as the best keeper in the world after a
14:29.180 - 14:35.880:  string of brilliant saves. Sikira Muskevich was immense as Sweden's stubbornness knocked out the
14:35.880 - 14:42.480:  tournament favourites USA and Becky Spentra Jamaica defied Germany on the way to three clean
14:42.480 - 14:54.280:  sheets in the group stage. A new era. USA won the previous two World Cups and it never finished
14:54.280 - 15:00.000:  lower than third in the eight previous tournaments. Germany wants dominated the European game
15:00.700 - 15:07.420:  but neither got anywhere near the business end of this World Cup. Instead Sam Kurs Australia embarked
15:07.420 - 15:13.380:  on a fairytale run to the semi-finals. England enjoyed their best ever tournament and Spain,
15:13.380 - 15:19.520:  despite missing a number of big names, took the title with a star which suggests they could become
15:19.520 - 15:26.920:  the ones to beat for a generation. And the celebrations when they touched down in Madrid were
15:35.400 - 15:39.020:  long and loud. That report by Nigel Adely
15:44.740 - 15:51.580:  still to come in this podcast. Just saying good joy on their faces and knowing that I was able to
15:51.580 - 15:58.940:  do something for my city, for my community, for women, hasn't inspired me. The woman helping
15:58.940 - 16:10.900:  free towns here early own deal with extreme heat. I could feel stigma all around me.
16:10.960 - 16:18.200:  Nearly died three, four times. I had this secret. This is Lives Less Ordinary, a podcast dedicated to
16:18.200 - 16:24.900:  remarkable personal stories. I started having a strength in me. Each week we hear tales of the
16:25.720 - 16:30.380:  unexpected. Walk in the shoes of some extraordinary people. It's something quite wonderful,
16:30.380 - 16:34.480:  search for Lives Less Ordinary. Wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
16:36.900 - 16:42.200:  Now to more of your sounds and this week there is a musical theme. Sam Oppenheim from the US
16:42.200 - 16:47.100:  Centre's This. He loves the anticipation of an orchestral concert.
16:54.300 - 16:59.600:  I love the sound because as soon as I hear those instruments tuning I know I'm in for some great
17:00.540 - 17:01.860:  classical music.
17:06.580 - 17:11.580:  And that was the Jackson Heights Community Orchestra tuning their instruments in Queens, New York.
17:11.580 - 17:18.200:  Thank you for that, Sam. And hi, I'm David Judge from Denver, Colorado. And my favorite sound
17:18.200 - 17:25.380:  is hearing my piano students on their very first lesson. Play a C major scale. I teach him to
17:26.140 - 17:31.700:  how to ascend the C scale and descend the C scale.
17:34.920 - 17:41.860:  And then I tell them pause after the first, second, fourth, sixth, and seventh notes of the scale.
17:48.260 - 17:54.740:  And invariably the joy on their face as they recognize the song and say,
17:55.460 - 17:59.140:  I can play this piano brings me so much happiness.
18:01.140 - 18:04.680:  And so David, for those who don't know that song is...
18:04.980 - 18:11.320:  It's joy to the world. A very famous Christmas song that I would say 95% of my students know
18:11.320 - 18:14.800:  what it is when they first encounter that as they practice their C scale.
18:15.100 - 18:19.580:  I can't think that I am the only person who is realising for the very first time
18:19.580 - 18:25.120:  that that song is actually a scale. I taught many years before I knew that. And I had a wonderful
18:25.120 - 18:30.400:  client of mine out of the blue. She sent me a YouTube video that Morgan Freeman had done.
18:30.400 - 18:34.560:  And he talked about how his mother taught him this. So I use it now in my lessons.
18:34.780 - 18:38.280:  Now you weren't always a music teacher, were you? Why did you make the change?
18:38.900 - 18:42.960:  I was a certified public accountant. I worked in the banking business and I was miserable.
18:42.960 - 18:48.720:  And my wife, she just put out some flyers. I don't have a background as a teacher. I just started
18:49.200 - 18:53.280:  teaching as those first people called in and sort of eased out of the accounting world and into
18:53.280 - 18:58.880:  the music world. And so I tell everybody I'm much poorer person financially because of what I'm
18:58.880 - 19:03.580:  doing. But I've added probably 10 years to my life just because of the joy that I find in teaching.
19:03.580 - 19:09.220:  I would not change a thing. Thank you David. And do keep your sounds coming.
19:09.880 - 19:14.340:  Now some of the other interesting things that we saw this week, India successfully landing a
19:14.460 - 19:20.220:  spacecraft on the moon with the first ever touchdown at the Luna South Pole. Chandrayan 3 will
19:20.220 - 19:25.560:  deploy a rover to look for water ice, which could help to establish permanent lunar bases.
19:26.300 - 19:31.160:  China has just celebrated the Chi Chi Festival, sort of similar to Valentine's Day.
19:31.580 - 19:36.720:  In the city of Kunming, they put on a kissing competition. The winning couple, who kissed like
19:36.720 - 19:41.500:  they really meant it for about half an hour, have been married for 10 years. A baby giraffe
19:41.500 - 19:46.900:  has been born at a zoo in Tennessee with none of the usual spots, just an all-brown coat.
19:47.240 - 19:53.760:  Such things are incredibly rare. Bright's zoo is inviting the public to help enaming her.
19:54.260 - 20:00.220:  And bravo fans of Malaga in Spain who protested about their football club's lack of recruitment
20:00.220 - 20:05.480:  following their relegation. By going to the airport and greeting random and very baffled
20:05.480 - 20:10.960:  strangers as if they were new signings with selfies chanting an autographs. And I will share a
20:10.960 - 20:14.600:  video of that on social media with the hashtag the HappyPod.
20:16.040 - 20:19.620:  Now let's hear about someone taking on the challenges of dealing with extreme heat.
20:20.020 - 20:24.340:  Very high temperatures can be exhausting and debilitating, especially for older people,
20:24.340 - 20:31.080:  small children and people who work outdoors. Eugenia Cagbo is the heat officer of Free Town Sierra
20:31.080 - 20:37.260:  Leone, and her mission is to improve the lives of her fellow citizens as temperatures rise in her
20:38.360 - 20:44.520:  city. What is really challenging about the situation is that within the informal settlement,
20:44.520 - 20:52.020:  90% of the houses are built from colligated iron sheets. And these are known for their heat
20:52.020 - 20:59.700:  trapping qualities. And within the formal settlement, 90% of the houses also are built from cement.
20:59.700 - 21:06.380:  And they're also known for their heat trapping qualities. So the level of heat stress intensifies
21:06.380 - 21:13.020:  and the ability and resources to deal with this becomes a challenge. So you are the heat officer,
21:13.600 - 21:20.960:  which innovations are you most proud of so far? In terms of the indoor, we have been working
21:20.960 - 21:27.960:  in partnership with an institution called Mia and they just developed this new technology,
21:27.960 - 21:34.700:  a very lightweight material and the reflectiveness of the material can provide
21:34.700 - 21:42.500:  up to six degrees of cooling effect. And we've seen a major success, residents that benefited
21:42.500 - 21:48.860:  have reported immense change in terms of how they feel, how well they can sleep now,
21:48.860 - 21:55.620:  and the level of cooling effects that they're feeling inside compared to when the installation
21:55.660 - 22:01.900:  wasn't done. And so in terms of her outdoor solutions, well the things that we've done is to
22:01.900 - 22:08.140:  advertise women, we thinned the informal settlement because most of them are outdoor workers.
22:08.460 - 22:13.100:  So what we've done is to implement shade covers in markets because these women
22:13.100 - 22:18.840:  straight on the street every single day expose to heat stress. A lot of them talked about
22:18.840 - 22:25.780:  suffering from headache and sunburns. So we did a pilot in three towns, Biggest Open
22:25.780 - 22:32.540:  Market and we installed shade covers and solar lights. And the shades instead of absorbing
22:32.540 - 22:36.620:  the heat, they were set the heat. But also the solar component helps to
22:36.620 - 22:43.600:  accuse off the sun's energy during the day and provide light for the women. And we have seen
22:43.600 - 22:52.000:  major improvement and just saying the joy on their faces and knowing that I was able to do
22:52.000 - 22:59.960:  something for my city, for my community, for women is something that hasn't inspired me to keep
22:59.960 - 23:06.880:  on doing what I do, just knowing that we can make that change, implementing the solutions together.
23:08.440 - 23:13.920:  Eugenia Cargo, heat officer of Free Town Sierra Leone. And from Sierra Leone to Scotland,
23:14.400 - 23:18.840:  over 3,000 acts have been vying for the attention of hundreds of thousands of visitors,
23:18.840 - 23:24.540:  who flocked to Edinburgh for the festival fringe every August. And from amid that tough
23:24.540 - 23:30.820:  competition, Lorna Rose-Treen was awarded the Dave Funniest Joke of the Fringe. She told us her
23:30.820 - 23:38.800:  reaction. I let out a wheel that only a pig could make. And I was just so bewildered. I've known
23:38.800 - 23:43.940:  about the Ed Fringe like best joke of the year since I was a student. I couldn't believe that I was
23:44.000 - 23:51.200:  getting to sit amongst those incredible people. For a lot of us, the very idea of standing in front
23:51.200 - 23:58.420:  of a room full of people who expect you to make them laugh is absolutely horrifying. How does
23:58.420 - 24:03.760:  you decide, yep, that's for me. So I think it isn't so it's really little. I've always loved making
24:03.760 - 24:08.220:  people laugh. When I was quite young, I would maybe idiot quite a lot amongst my family because
24:08.220 - 24:13.380:  I knew it would make them laugh. And it just brought like so much joy to make people laugh is just
24:14.000 - 24:19.740:  what a privilege to be able to do. It's the best feeling ever. It is really scary. But I remember a
24:19.740 - 24:24.200:  teacher telling me once that the feeling of nerves in your belly and butterflies is exactly the same
24:24.200 - 24:28.480:  feeling as excitement. So whenever I get nervous, I just think that and I try and let the adrenaline
24:28.480 - 24:33.900:  keep me going. So you say this has always been a part of your life, but you've had actually got a
24:33.900 - 24:39.440:  fairly sensible path laid out in front of you and then decided to go and become a clown. Yeah,
24:39.860 - 24:46.100:  I was a radio journalist. Honestly, the amazing people I met. So I was working in the BBC
24:46.100 - 24:52.560:  offices and producing programmes and one day I just thought, I really need to be doing comedy.
24:52.560 - 24:58.560:  I need to give this a shot because if not now, then when and also I'll just regret it if I don't
24:58.560 - 25:04.200:  give it a go. So I left to go to clown school in France, which my mum was you know, mildly concerned
25:04.200 - 25:09.920:  about because I spent my savings that I'd earned in my first ever job, what proper job I spent it
25:09.920 - 25:16.580:  on clown school. But I didn't regret it. It really felt like the right decision at a big scary
25:16.580 - 25:22.400:  leak. And also I don't think I even still know what clown school is. So it was really like a leap
25:22.400 - 25:28.520:  into the unknown. Now, Laura, to be fair, looking at some of the jokes laid out the top 10 jokes,
25:29.480 - 25:35.080:  charitably, they don't all look hilarious written down. Do they?
25:35.880 - 25:41.020:  No, I mean, the jokes that win this award are Christmas cracker jokes basically. They're jokes
25:41.020 - 25:47.820:  that work in the context of a few lines that like the best joke of the fringe isn't one that
25:47.820 - 25:51.900:  can be, isn't a pun. It is one that can be summarised in a few words. It's a joke that you have
25:51.900 - 25:57.260:  to be in the room for because that's what life comedy is about. So your joke, your winning joke
25:57.720 - 26:04.300:  is delivered by a character, isn't it? So build up your joke for us and drum roll, deliver please.
26:04.960 - 26:09.560:  I'm a character comedian. So all of the characters that I do are basically canvases for these
26:09.600 - 26:14.680:  really ridiculous jokes. I get away with saying some awful puns because I can just shut them into
26:14.680 - 26:20.620:  characters and it's acceptable for them to say rather than whether you're doing like normal standup.
26:21.060 - 26:27.200:  So my joke is part of a set. She's like a film noir kind of good girl gone bad. She's a really
26:27.200 - 26:34.960:  mysterious woman. So sexy. She wanders into a bar at 4am and she's talking to all of these
26:34.960 - 26:39.760:  bar men, the audience of the barmen and she's got loads of cigarettes in her mouth. I have hundreds
26:39.760 - 26:43.820:  of cigarettes that I keep dropping out of my mouth and putting another one in and I'm explaining
26:43.820 - 26:48.440:  about my life and talking about all of the things that I've been getting up to to try and fill the
26:48.440 - 26:55.500:  holes in my life. I say I started dating a zookeeper but it turned out he was a cheater.
27:00.080 - 27:01.460:  That was Lorna Rose Tream.
27:06.120 - 27:09.720:  And that's it from us for now. Remember if you would like to be part of the happy
