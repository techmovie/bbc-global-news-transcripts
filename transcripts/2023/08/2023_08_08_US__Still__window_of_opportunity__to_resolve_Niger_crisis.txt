00:49.020 - 00:52.920:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:55.000 - 00:58.340:  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 8th of August,
00:58.660 - 00:59.940:  these are our main stories.
00:59.940 - 01:05.520:  The US says it believes there's still a window of opportunity to resolve the crisis in Niger
01:05.520 - 01:10.360:  as the West African Regional Block Echoes agrees to meet on Thursday.
01:10.740 - 01:15.960:  A senior Israeli military official describes attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians
01:15.960 - 01:19.040:  in the occupied West Bank as a form of terrorism.
01:19.700 - 01:24.940:  Donald Trump's lawyers have opposed an attempt to limit what information he can make public
01:25.380 - 01:30.040:  about the prosecution on charges of trying to overturn the 2020 election.
01:32.760 - 01:37.080:  Also in this podcast, Ukraine's security forces say they've discovered another plot
01:37.080 - 01:39.540:  to assassinate President Zelensky.
01:39.980 - 01:44.780:  And the film The Exorcist caused controversy when it was released in 1973.
01:45.580 - 01:49.740:  Some critics called the movie a masterpiece, others branded it a monstrosity.
01:50.260 - 01:54.560:  Now its director William Friedkin has died at the age of 87.
01:55.040 - 01:56.700:  We look back on his life.
02:01.640 - 02:05.740:  West African leaders will hold another emergency summit on the crisis in Niger
02:05.740 - 02:11.400:  after the country's new military rulers defied and ultimatum to restore the elected government.
02:11.460 - 02:15.800:  The regional block Echoes had threatened possible military intervention
02:15.800 - 02:21.240:  if the army didn't reinstate President Mohammed Bazoum by midnight on Sunday.
02:21.800 - 02:26.720:  Speaking on Monday, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said he'd been in touch with
02:26.720 - 02:32.540:  Niger's deposed president and reiterated his call for the democratically elected government
02:32.540 - 02:33.900:  to be reinstate it.
02:34.080 - 02:39.300:  We strongly support the work that Echoes is doing to try to help restore the constitutional order.
02:39.520 - 02:43.540:  In Niger, I've been in close touch with President Bazoum with many colleagues in the region,
02:43.540 - 02:47.060:  including the Nigerian president Danubu, colleagues at the African Union.
02:47.460 - 02:51.520:  And it's very important that that constitutional order be restored.
02:51.520 - 02:57.180:  And right now, I think, Echoes is playing an important role in moving the country back in that
02:57.180 - 02:57.540:  direction.
02:57.980 - 03:03.200:  Our Africa regional editor Richard Hamilton told me more about what Washington had to say.
03:03.520 - 03:07.820:  They've held talks still urging the military junta to step aside.
03:07.820 - 03:12.500:  And they say there's still a window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution.
03:12.660 - 03:16.640:  They said they've suspended more than $100 million of aid.
03:16.860 - 03:22.220:  And earlier, Marley and Burkina Faso said they were sending a delegation from their countries
03:22.500 - 03:25.660:  to Niyame, the capital in Niger, in support of the junta.
03:25.820 - 03:32.080:  The Ku leaders had closed the airspace above Niger, anticipating some sort of military intervention.
03:32.880 - 03:37.320:  And a flight tracking software showed a transport plane going from
03:37.320 - 03:43.100:  Wagadougu, the capital of Burkina Faso to Niyame, hours after airspace was closed.
03:43.760 - 03:48.820:  I think it has to be said that the regional block has not played its hand particularly well.
03:48.820 - 03:54.200:  They had this very, very tough talking out of matem with a very strong threat.
03:54.200 - 03:59.020:  And there was a huge build up to this deadline on Sunday night, where we were expecting
03:59.040 - 04:00.680:  some sort of military intervention.
04:00.820 - 04:05.140:  And then since that deadline passed, there was just a deafening silence.
04:05.140 - 04:10.920:  And now they say they will hold a meeting on Thursday, which doesn't suggest a lot of urgency.
04:10.960 - 04:14.840:  It's sort of a bit like if in doubt what to do, we'll hold another meeting.
04:15.260 - 04:19.200:  And it all implies that perhaps they played their cards a bit too early,
04:19.380 - 04:21.880:  and they don't sort of have any leverage anymore.
04:21.880 - 04:25.980:  And I think Eka was was taken by surprise by the Ku in the first place.
04:26.420 - 04:31.500:  And it's complicated by the fact that about a million Nigerian refugees are in Niger,
04:31.500 - 04:33.620:  and they're really ethnically the same.
04:33.700 - 04:37.300:  So Nigeria doesn't want to send in troops against their own kin.
04:37.300 - 04:38.880:  So it's all a bit of a mess.
04:39.820 - 04:40.700:  Richard Hamilton.
04:41.360 - 04:45.520:  Well, Paul Mellie is a journalist and consulting fellow on the Africa program
04:45.920 - 04:48.200:  at the Chatham House think tank here in London.
04:48.520 - 04:53.020:  Gary Adonik, you asked him whether the junta will take the passing of the deadline
04:53.020 - 04:57.420:  without any obvious action as a sign that Eka was has lost its nerve.
04:57.980 - 05:00.300:  I don't think so unless they're very stupid.
05:00.300 - 05:05.820:  It's fairly obvious that Eka was needed to set a fairly tight initial deadline
05:05.860 - 05:10.520:  just to get momentum because in handling the other crises,
05:10.520 - 05:14.540:  whether it being coups before in West Africa over the last three years,
05:14.880 - 05:17.060:  the clock has been run down if you like.
05:17.100 - 05:21.440:  They've let a longer period of time elapsed before really negotiating.
05:21.440 - 05:25.860:  And I think their conclusion was they needed to take a much tougher line with Niger.
05:25.860 - 05:29.000:  And I imagine that the junta will have understood that.
05:29.460 - 05:33.300:  So I don't think the junta will think that Eka was is backing off.
05:33.620 - 05:37.900:  In fact, with the sanctions biting hard and various West African governments
05:37.900 - 05:40.900:  announcing troops that are assigned to the force,
05:41.100 - 05:43.340:  they will know it's a serious threat.
05:43.340 - 05:46.300:  But that doesn't mean that they will cave in.
05:46.580 - 05:49.560:  Eka was getting together in a booger on Thursday.
05:49.560 - 05:51.580:  What do you think their next steps will be?
05:51.720 - 05:54.900:  I think they will first take stock of the impact of sanctions.
05:55.540 - 05:57.660:  Niger is a landlocked country.
05:57.900 - 06:01.960:  And most of its trade flows down to the West Africa coast.
06:01.960 - 06:05.980:  And most of the country's imports come in through Nigeria and Benin.
06:05.980 - 06:08.880:  So that leaves it very trade exposed.
06:09.300 - 06:14.140:  And it's also part of the CFA Frank West African single currency block
06:14.140 - 06:16.360:  whose central bank is actually in Senegal.
06:16.660 - 06:20.380:  So Eka West and the Allied monetary block have the cloud
06:20.940 - 06:23.600:  to apply some really serious economic pressure.
06:23.600 - 06:25.760:  And we're already seeing prices going up.
06:26.020 - 06:28.960:  So they will, first of all, want to see what impact
06:28.960 - 06:30.880:  that economic message is having.
06:30.880 - 06:34.480:  And they want to demonstrate to their own publics
06:34.640 - 06:37.280:  that they are giving negotiation a chance.
06:37.440 - 06:43.260:  I would be quite surprised if they moved instantly to decide on force after Thursday.
06:43.600 - 06:47.040:  I mean, they can't really decide on force because some of their members are simply against
06:47.040 - 06:47.700:  down there.
06:47.920 - 06:52.480:  The way Eka West operates, the countries that currently have military regimes,
06:53.180 - 06:55.280:  their membership is effectively suspended.
06:55.280 - 07:00.900:  So Marley, Guinea and Burkina Faso, in a sense, don't have a say in this decision.
07:01.900 - 07:02.640:  Paul Mellie.
07:03.360 - 07:08.020:  As we record this podcast, a senior American diplomat says she's held
07:08.020 - 07:11.860:  Frank and difficult discussions with the military junta in Niger.
07:12.400 - 07:15.420:  Victorian Yuland, who's the acting deputy secretary of state,
07:15.420 - 07:19.440:  said the coup leaders hadn't agreed to restore the democratic order
07:19.840 - 07:23.500:  and didn't let her meet the deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum.
07:24.180 - 07:26.460:  Speaking from the capital of Niger, Niami,
07:26.760 - 07:30.500:  Miss Yuland added that Niger's coup leaders understood the risks
07:30.820 - 07:33.120:  of working with the Russian mercenary group Wagner,
07:33.560 - 07:35.700:  which is active in neighboring countries.
07:36.260 - 07:40.380:  The Israeli military chief spokesman has described violence by Israeli settlers
07:40.380 - 07:44.020:  against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank as terrorism.
07:44.660 - 07:47.860:  He also linked it to a rise in attacks by Palestinians.
07:48.020 - 07:52.000:  His comments echo those reportedly made by the head of Israel's
07:52.000 - 07:57.020:  internal security service, which have been denounced by some far-right politicians
07:57.020 - 07:58.440:  in the Israeli government.
07:59.100 - 08:01.280:  Here's our Middle East correspondent Yuland Nell.
08:01.800 - 08:03.660:  In a round of interviews on Israeli media,
08:03.660 - 08:08.020:  the army's top spokesman addressed a weekend of violence in the West Bank and Israel.
08:08.020 - 08:13.760:  On Friday, a young Palestinian man was killed in an attack by armed settlers on a village near Ramallah,
08:14.060 - 08:18.140:  and the next day, a Palestinian fatally shot a security guard in Tel Aviv
08:18.140 - 08:20.200:  before another guard shot him dead.
08:20.800 - 08:24.220:  Yesterday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians in Janine,
08:24.220 - 08:26.300:  who were said to have been planning an attack.
08:26.940 - 08:28.480:  Speaking to the Wynette news site,
08:28.760 - 08:32.280:  rear Admiral Daniel Haggari strengthened his usual language to describe
08:32.280 - 08:38.460:  settler violence as terrorism, and he said it was pushing Palestinians into what he called terror too.
08:53.380 - 08:57.980:  Those remarks echo a warning that was reportedly given by the head of Israel's internal security
08:57.980 - 09:01.340:  service to the Prime Minister before Friday's deadly incidents.
09:01.900 - 09:06.080:  Far-right members of the governing coalition then accused him of being a leftist
09:06.380 - 09:09.400:  and unable to distinguish between the enemy and his own people,
09:09.400 - 09:13.120:  prompting the Prime Minister to voice his support for his security official.
09:13.140 - 09:18.920:  There's been growing international concern about a recent rise in violence by extremist settlers
09:19.280 - 09:24.640:  under Israel's hard-line government, with the U.S. also labeling Friday's attack as terrorism.
09:25.460 - 09:30.440:  You land now. The former U.S. President Donald Trump and his lawyers had until
09:30.440 - 09:35.920:  Monday evening to respond to a request for a court order banning any evidence sharing about
09:35.920 - 09:41.000:  the federal case he faces on overturning the election result in the 2020 election.
09:41.780 - 09:46.360:  Before the legal response, Mr. Trump tried to turn the tables on prosecutor Jack Smith
09:46.360 - 09:52.220:  by posting that it was Mr Smith who was deranged and needed a protective order to stop him
09:52.220 - 09:56.820:  from leaking stories. Our North America correspondent Peter Bose told me what happened.
09:57.100 - 10:03.560:  Well, Mr. Trump and his team met the deadline, which was to respond to the initial request
10:03.560 - 10:07.840:  by the prosecution, the request to the judge for this protective order,
10:08.020 - 10:14.160:  restricting the use of the evidence during this phase of the case, which is known as the discovery
10:14.160 - 10:18.780:  phase. The evidence is being shared between the prosecution and the defense that happens in
10:18.780 - 10:23.880:  every criminal trial. It gives the defense an opportunity to see what the specific information
10:23.880 - 10:28.520:  is that the prosecution is going to take to court and it gives them time to prepare.
10:29.100 - 10:34.260:  In this specific case, the request is that Donald Trump shouldn't be allowed to go on social media
10:34.260 - 10:40.700:  and reveal what that evidence is. He can't talk about it in television interviews or make a speech
10:40.700 - 10:48.000:  about it at one of his many rallies. The reason that the prosecution is asking for this is that
10:48.000 - 10:53.420:  this is very detailed. There's a substantial amount of information and there is a concern that it
10:53.420 - 10:59.660:  could intimidate some witnesses who are likely to be called to the court whenever the trial is
10:59.660 - 11:04.180:  in a few months time. And the release of this information now could affect them. And of course,
11:04.180 - 11:10.460:  there was that social media post just a few days ago by Mr. Trump. If you go after me,
11:10.460 - 11:17.620:  I'm coming after you. His defense team have argued that in fact that was not meant to be in relation
11:17.620 - 11:23.480:  to the case he was talking about something else. It is typical of Donald Trump to attack using
11:23.480 - 11:30.320:  name calling his opponents. And I think it is likely to come as no surprise to Jack Smith or
11:30.320 - 11:35.760:  indeed any others on his team that Donald Trump, if he is legally allowed to, is likely to continue
11:35.760 - 11:42.320:  with this kind of language. Peter Bose. The Taliban in Afghanistan has banned girls who are more
11:42.320 - 11:49.320:  than 10 years old from attending school. Since the Taliban regained power in 2021, girls and women
11:49.320 - 11:55.460:  have been banned from amusement parks, public baths, gyms and sports clubs. Women are also not
11:55.460 - 12:01.480:  allowed to work in NGO offices or go to university. And last month the Taliban ordered the closure
12:01.480 - 12:08.000:  of all beauty salons. The international community has widely condemned the severe limits being imposed
12:08.000 - 12:13.940:  on the rights of women and girls. Devina Gupta asked former member of the Afghan Parliament
12:13.940 - 12:20.640:  Shukriya Barakzai what she thought about this latest development. I'm not surprised because the
12:20.640 - 12:29.420:  brutality of the Taliban was clear when they was ruling Afghanistan from 1995 till 2001. They
12:29.420 - 12:37.160:  totally banned the schools for the girls. Not even the primary students the girl was not able to go.
12:37.640 - 12:44.320:  They by the Taliban are really showing their true color despite of all the international pressure
12:44.320 - 12:50.540:  and despite of the Doha agreement that they've signed and they accept a sorts of human rights
12:50.620 - 12:58.260:  and it shows how Taliban could go more far to eliminate and erase women from every single
12:58.260 - 13:04.120:  aspect of life. It is very sad to see the international community also. They are still keeping their
13:04.120 - 13:09.480:  engagement with the Taliban. Shukriya do you feel that a lot of times then women rights are
13:09.480 - 13:13.920:  sort of used as a bargaining tool also by the Taliban with the international community.
13:14.400 - 13:19.080:  This is what's the problem because as long as the international community asking change
13:19.080 - 13:26.880:  on the policy of Taliban, Taliban are abandoning and crossing more lines in terms of women's rights
13:26.880 - 13:33.680:  issue. Not only they didn't allow in girls from the years three or according to their school
13:33.680 - 13:39.200:  with the age of ten. They see even physically if some girls even if they are not even ten years
13:39.200 - 13:45.140:  or above ten, physically they look bigger. They are not allowed to go. The number of force
13:45.140 - 13:53.040:  marriages and child marriages had been increased. If you see their policy from August 15, 2021
13:53.140 - 14:01.160:  tell August 20 at 23 day by day they were bargaining the international community asking for
14:01.160 - 14:06.500:  women's rights and human rights and the Taliban banned the women's rights and this is the
14:06.500 - 14:11.700:  woman of Afghanistan. We are the one to pay the price. The moderate Taliban are not the
14:11.700 - 14:17.920:  moderate, the less conservative Taliban are not that powerful to change their policy even where
14:17.920 - 14:24.340:  the area they are more empowered. So even over there we cannot see a different type of approach
14:24.500 - 14:30.440:  of Taliban towards women. I think this is the tool they are really like to chasing more international
14:30.460 - 14:36.160:  community under name of moderate Taliban. Their policy towards women is exactly the same.
14:36.160 - 14:42.280:  If you see how many of them are joining the polygamy and taking second, third, even fourth
14:42.280 - 14:48.440:  wife in the last two years you will say there's a no sign of moderate Taliban. I cannot see any
14:48.440 - 14:55.540:  sign of political will among the Taliban to change their policy and their behavior and their
14:55.540 - 15:02.520:  rule in regulation towards women. Shukriya Paraksai speaking to Divina Gupta. How to deal with the
15:02.520 - 15:08.120:  asylum seekers is an issue facing many countries, not least in the UK where political parties,
15:08.120 - 15:14.340:  charities and voters are split on what to do. On Monday a floating barge that will house
15:14.340 - 15:19.600:  hundreds of migrants officially opened off the south coast of England. The government says it will
15:19.600 - 15:24.480:  be cheaper than putting asylum seekers in hotels while their applications are decided.
15:25.200 - 15:30.660:  But campaigners have described the conditions on borders inhumane. Dan Johnson is in Portland
15:30.660 - 15:36.260:  in the southern English County of Dorset where the barge is. The first few men walked up the ramp
15:36.260 - 15:41.220:  and boarded this vessel marking a new moment in how we welcome those who reached the shores seeking
15:41.220 - 15:45.820:  asylum. They've been moved from hotels as part of the government's determination to reduce
15:45.820 - 15:51.220:  accommodation bills and deter dangerous channel crossings. Cheryl Avery's director for asylum
15:51.220 - 15:56.180:  accommodation at the home office. So we successfully onboarded the first cohort today and there are
15:56.180 - 16:01.840:  15 people onboard. We have had a few challenges but this is part of a long-going structured process
16:02.340 - 16:06.840:  to bring up to 500 people onboard. There have been some minor legal challenges and I can't go
16:06.840 - 16:11.880:  to the detail of those but accommodation is offered to all individuals on a no-choice basis.
16:11.880 - 16:19.180:  Stay it loud, stay it clear. There's been huge opposition in this community and beyond.
16:19.180 - 16:24.400:  But today protesters from stand-up to racism in Dorset were here to welcome the asylum seekers
16:24.400 - 16:28.420:  and hand them care packages even though they're against this form of accommodation.
16:29.240 - 16:34.100:  We wanted to show we had, we wanted to show that there is support from the local community
16:34.100 - 16:39.720:  and we partly wanted to help them give them some things they might need. We have to welcome them
16:39.720 - 16:42.640:  and they're here, they're here now and we have to welcome them.
16:42.880 - 16:47.780:  But listen to Ian Broadford. This is my island. We came to challenge those perspectives.
16:48.400 - 16:52.060:  This isn't being racist, this is just us saying we need to look after ourselves.
16:52.400 - 16:57.020:  We've got on-suite showers, getting free, cooked meals a day, really they're living like kings.
16:58.660 - 17:01.860:  This vessel's been weighed down with debate and beset by delays.
17:01.860 - 17:06.860:  Ministers say it's safe but after a refit to double its capacity there are concerns about
17:06.860 - 17:10.400:  fire safety. The fire brigade's union labeled it a death trap.
17:11.040 - 17:13.280:  Caroline Parks is the labour mayor of Portland.
17:13.780 - 17:18.940:  We need to remember that these are human beings and they have dreams and aspirations just like
17:18.940 - 17:24.280:  everybody else. The hotel bills are enormous. Is it not right to try to tackle this?
17:24.420 - 17:29.160:  The way to tackle something like that is to prevent it and the way to prevent that is to
17:29.160 - 17:34.740:  invest properly in the asylum and immigration system. 20 asylum seekers are refusing to move here
17:34.740 - 17:40.900:  fearful of what conditions may be like on board when it reaches its full capacity of 500 men.
17:41.380 - 17:42.040:  Dan Johnson.
17:44.660 - 17:49.500:  Still to come on the Global News podcast, the women's game is closing. The gap is closing
17:49.500 - 17:53.320:  between the top teams and teams are not traditionally seen as one of the strong teams.
17:53.920 - 17:59.460:  Why the underdogs have booted out some of the favourites in the football women's World Cup.
18:03.660 - 18:09.180:  In Ukraine, the security surface says it's detained a woman for allegedly being involved in a plot
18:09.180 - 18:14.560:  to assassinate President Zelensky while on a visit to the southern Mikhailai of region.
18:14.660 - 18:20.220:  At the start of the war, Mr. Zelensky said he was aware that Russia's President Putin wanted
18:20.220 - 18:26.160:  him dead. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian President says his country is well within its rights to respond
18:26.180 - 18:31.060:  if Russia continues to dominate ports and launch missiles in the Black Sea.
18:31.940 - 18:34.260:  I spoke to James Waterhouse, who is in chief.
18:34.840 - 18:40.680:  This is quite a tale. They allege that this woman shared information with Russia,
18:41.020 - 18:46.040:  which allowed invading forces to plan an air strike around President Zelensky's visit
18:46.040 - 18:51.260:  to the southern Mikhailai of region at the end of July, and that they stepped in after
18:51.260 - 18:55.880:  monitoring her for several weeks where they allege that she would travel the area,
18:55.880 - 19:00.320:  take pictures of different sites that would potentially give away locations of what they call
19:00.320 - 19:06.580:  Ukrainian electronic warfare systems, so presumably radars and missiles areas, for example,
19:06.580 - 19:11.220:  as well as ammunition depots, and she would go around take images and send them to her
19:11.220 - 19:16.120:  Russian handlers several times. And not just that, this woman reportedly worked in the military
19:16.120 - 19:22.120:  shop on one of the Ukrainian army bases in the region, but I think what this also does is serve as
19:22.120 - 19:26.860:  a reminder of the risks that President Zelensky faces when he travels across the vastness
19:26.860 - 19:31.520:  of Ukraine. It's always been important to him to appear in different cities as well as could
19:31.520 - 19:37.100:  be in close to the front line. And how many threats is he facing, do you think?
19:37.460 - 19:41.540:  I think it's more of a constant threat. What the security services are telling us is that they
19:41.540 - 19:48.780:  have stopped around 12 to 13 direct assassination attempts, but they don't say over what timeline.
19:48.860 - 19:54.660:  This does remind me of the early days of the invasion when Russia firmly had key of in its sites,
19:54.660 - 19:59.220:  and there were reported attempts on the presidential palace. What they did at one point
19:59.220 - 20:03.940:  hoped to do was topple the administration and install their own puppet. That has not happened,
20:03.940 - 20:11.200:  which is why President Zelensky remains target number one for Moscow, wherever he goes. He has a heavy
20:11.200 - 20:17.400:  detail with him, trips are often unannounced or short notice. It's quite the operation, but he still
20:17.400 - 20:23.500:  sets out to do this. And he has been talking, hasn't he, about Ukraine being well within its rights
20:23.500 - 20:29.680:  to respond in kind if Russia continues to dominate in the Black Sea? What Ukraine is trying to do is
20:29.680 - 20:34.840:  they're trying to create a distinction because what they've said is look, targets or threats in
20:34.840 - 20:41.380:  our occupied territories or the Black Sea are fair game. We're within our rights to take those out
20:41.400 - 20:46.400:  in the continued defence of our country. But that clearly stretches to coastal Russian cities,
20:46.400 - 20:52.900:  like Novela-Sysk, major terminals from Moscow, which was hit by a sea drone this week, where Ukraine
20:52.900 - 20:58.160:  is less keen to admit responsibility. Are the increased drone strikes we are seeing not just on
20:58.160 - 21:03.980:  border locations but deep and inside Moscow itself? There's been evidence in the past that Ukraine is
21:03.980 - 21:08.960:  behind it. There are several incidents where you don't know for sure, but this war's footprint
21:08.960 - 21:14.440:  is getting bigger and I suspect that Western Allies who've long been nervous about a further
21:14.440 - 21:20.420:  escalation. It's either Ukraine ignoring those concerns or Western Allies becoming more relaxed
21:20.420 - 21:26.640:  with the idea of Ukraine looking to destabilise Russia in this way. James Waterhouse in Kiev.
21:27.660 - 21:33.140:  Six months on from the devastating earthquake that hit Turkey in Syria, hundreds of thousands of
21:33.140 - 21:38.360:  people are still displaced. Just days after the disaster struck in February,
21:38.360 - 21:44.840:  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to rebuild the region within a year. While progress
21:44.840 - 21:50.800:  has been made in her tie, one of the hardest hit provinces, the damage has been so vast that
21:50.800 - 21:57.120:  improvements have been slow to materialise. Victoria Craig reports from Antakia in southern Turkey.
22:00.520 - 22:05.580:  Muha'aram Chayaraja is pounding a mixture of broad beans and tahini to make a regional
22:05.580 - 22:10.580:  version of hummus for a customer. His business was destroyed in February's earthquakes,
22:10.580 - 22:15.900:  so he set up a temporary shop in a container outfitted with the kitchen, prep counters,
22:15.900 - 22:22.960:  even a dinon area with tables and chairs amid the rubble. We don't receive any help of support
22:22.960 - 22:28.320:  from anyone. Your municipality only allocated a place for us. Me and my brothers, we took the
22:28.320 - 22:33.440:  responsibility for equipping and furnishing the place ourselves. He lost 22 relatives in the earthquake.
22:33.540 - 22:39.040:  His family owned a butcher, a bakery and a meze restaurant serving traditional small plates
22:39.040 - 22:44.360:  like the broad bean hummus he is preparing. After the disaster, Muha'aram and his brothers
22:44.360 - 22:52.160:  decided to pour their savings into getting themselves back up and running. Initially, we faced a
22:52.160 - 22:57.760:  water shortage. In the beginning, we used the generator for electricity during the day. Later on,
22:57.760 - 23:02.360:  we managed to connect directly to the electric lines. The authorities helped us with the electricity
23:02.360 - 23:09.380:  and water supply. Back in February, President Erdogan promised the city would go back to normal
23:09.380 - 23:17.380:  in a year, but six months on, there's still a long way to go. Antakia was ravaged by the natural
23:17.380 - 23:22.280:  disaster, and while determined businesses like Muha'aram have risen from the rubble,
23:22.580 - 23:25.840:  the cleanup operation is still a day and night process.
23:28.660 - 23:33.560:  The sound of digging machines, scooping up tangles of metal and concrete is everywhere.
23:33.920 - 23:38.580:  Huge lots where buildings once stood shoulder to shoulder are now yearly empty,
23:38.580 - 23:43.680:  while in other places structures marked for demolition still stand cross-sectioned,
23:44.020 - 23:47.580:  with kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms still visible from the street.
23:47.580 - 23:52.860:  Some 164,000 people are still living in tents and containers in this province,
23:52.880 - 23:56.560:  nearly 4,000 businesses operate in temporary structures.
23:57.940 - 24:03.480:  Right now, our main focus is to revive trade, industry, and support small businesses.
24:04.020 - 24:08.660:  This is Hussein Yaiman, a member of Parliament from Hatay, who serves in President Erdogan's
24:08.660 - 24:11.240:  Justice and Development Party, or AKP.
24:12.980 - 24:17.840:  Because if the economy revives, trade thrives, and life gets back on track,
24:18.260 - 24:19.720:  then people's lives will improve.
24:20.860 - 24:25.640:  Back at Muha'aram's shop, he tells me the most immediate need is the demolition of the damaged
24:25.640 - 24:32.460:  buildings so reconstruction can finally begin. It would be like the first piece of a line of dominoes.
24:32.820 - 24:35.780:  If trade starts in the markets and the market's formation strengthens,
24:36.260 - 24:39.300:  and if the support for small businesses further reinforced by our government,
24:39.940 - 24:41.860:  we believe that the recovery will be faster.
24:43.480 - 24:48.840:  Like many in this container shop community, Muha'aram says the hardest part is drumming up business
24:48.840 - 24:52.940:  since tens of thousands of people fled the area after the earthquakes.
24:53.060 - 24:57.340:  But he says he's thankful for his life and livelihood, and to leave the rest,
24:57.880 - 24:59.380:  to God and the municipality.
25:00.260 - 25:01.220:  Victoria Craig.
25:02.160 - 25:06.500:  People in Haiti have been expressing skepticism about a recent offer from Kenya
25:06.940 - 25:11.660:  to lead a multinational force to help address brutal gang violence in the country,
25:12.080 - 25:14.000:  which has displaced tens of thousands.
25:14.660 - 25:19.360:  Nairobi offered a thousand police officers in response to a call by Haitian Prime Minister
25:19.360 - 25:21.840:  Ariel Henry for international support.
25:22.760 - 25:27.700:  But local perceptions of Kenya's rights record are causing worry about its capacity to
25:27.700 - 25:34.220:  restore security in Haiti. Dr Jean Butto is a university professor in the capital Porte Prince.
25:34.800 - 25:39.480:  There are two things that we should consider. It is first the fact that the government
25:39.480 - 25:44.960:  has requested that intervention. At that time, it was not about Kenya. Probably,
25:44.960 - 25:50.700:  the government was thinking about some kind of coalition with very big countries like United
25:50.700 - 25:56.380:  States, Canada, and maybe some countries in Europe. Whatever country it would not have been
25:56.380 - 26:01.700:  welcome. In terms of human rights issues, we've all to respect for people from Kenya,
26:01.700 - 26:08.740:  Kenya's police forces, and armed forces are not good examples. This is how we feel in general
26:08.740 - 26:14.800:  in Haiti. There are many other steps that should have been taken before thinking about intervention.
26:14.820 - 26:22.260:  The main issue is that neither the international community and the Asian government do not want
26:22.260 - 26:28.700:  to make the proper steps that would be facing the political situation. We are facing political
26:28.700 - 26:35.840:  crisis. There is a crisis of succession. So when Mr. juvenile Moe is died in any other situation,
26:35.900 - 26:43.020:  we probably would have a smooth or normal succession that did not happen because all the institutional
26:43.020 - 26:48.960:  infrastructures in Haiti were dismantled. We do not have to accept that the political issue
26:48.960 - 26:55.300:  must continue the way it is. If the Kenyan forces do not come, of course, we are going to be
26:55.300 - 27:01.680:  probably facing uncertainty every day. When I go out, I do not know what can happen in the next
27:01.680 - 27:07.520:  corner. My kids are not living here for the moment, but it doesn't mean that it must be that way.
27:08.160 - 27:15.140:  Dr. Jean Bouteau. In the last 16 in the football women's world cup, the co-hosts Australia are
27:15.140 - 27:22.060:  through to the quarter finals, after beating Denmark 2-0. England squeaked through 4-2-1 penalties
27:22.060 - 27:28.260:  after a well-organised Nigerian team challenged the lionesses in a match that saw the England player
27:28.260 - 27:40.480:  Lauren James getting a red card. In more kickoff games on Tuesday, Colombia will take on Jamaica
27:40.480 - 27:46.320:  and France hopes to beat Morocco. Our sports reporter Mimi Fabias has been following the action
27:46.320 - 27:50.760:  and she told me first that Nigeria had been unlucky to lose to England.
27:51.140 - 27:56.080:  Nigeria were very unlucky to lose a match. They were the better side in the game against England.
27:56.080 - 28:02.400:  They were very solid, defensively, even in attack. Nigeria had more shots on target and they came
28:02.400 - 28:06.940:  close to leading a few times in the match, but unfortunately for England as well,
28:06.940 - 28:13.000:  Lauren James was sent off. Nigeria were very good at keeping a quiet in the game. The midfielders
28:13.000 - 28:17.300:  did a very good job in that side of things. She of course picked up their red cards,
28:17.300 - 28:22.840:  stamping on the Nigerian defenders back. That caused a lot of people quite upset on social media,
28:22.840 - 28:28.500:  and that was the right call. But Nigeria overall were just so unlucky. So we have matches ahead.
28:28.500 - 28:35.080:  What's your thinking about those? Now I think Morocco could possibly spring up an upset tomorrow
28:35.080 - 28:40.840:  against France, of all the African teams that have went through to the last 16, three African
28:40.840 - 28:44.580:  teams of the first time in history. Morocco, the ones who really have responded well,
28:44.580 - 28:50.060:  especially losing in that first match, six-nil against Germany. They will be playing France
28:50.060 - 28:55.860:  an exciting match to watch out for tomorrow. And as well as Japan, they're playing on Friday,
28:55.860 - 29:01.720:  and they are looking very good in this competition. And of course we've got Colombia, Jamaica too.
29:01.900 - 29:08.800:  And what is striking you Mimi? Is it that a lot of these teams that were underdogs are actually
29:08.800 - 29:14.480:  really playing out their skins? Now I tweeted something earlier on today. I said,
29:15.200 - 29:21.260:  if only there's proper infrastructure in place support, no paid disputes professionalising the
29:21.260 - 29:25.940:  leagues. And I put that, I guess you could say to Africa, because I'm African. So I looked at
29:25.940 - 29:31.200:  the women's game in Africa, but you could also look at that beyond. You can see how the gap
29:31.200 - 29:36.600:  is closing between the so-called favourites, the big teams, and teams that people traditionally
29:36.600 - 29:42.060:  have looked at smaller teams. You can see that gap closing, and that gap is closing with not
29:42.060 - 29:47.340:  the same infrastructure and facilities that we see in the West. So there have been, I think,
29:47.340 - 29:53.460:  a wake-up call for many federations to see countries alike. For example, Jamaica crowd funding
29:53.460 - 29:58.400:  to come in and seeing how well they're doing in the competition through to the last 16 for the
29:58.400 - 30:03.820:  first time in their history, seeing as well, Nigeria paid disputes South Africa with paid disputes
30:03.820 - 30:09.380:  coming through to the last 16. You can only imagine now that the women's game is closing. The gap
30:09.380 - 30:13.800:  is closing between the top teams and teams are not traditionally seen as one of the strong teams.
30:14.540 - 30:21.460:  Mimi Fawas. The acclaimed film director, producer and screenwriter William Friedkin has died. He was
30:21.460 - 30:27.060:  87. A member of the new Hollywood movement he was most famous for films such as The French
30:27.060 - 30:30.940:  Connection and The Exorcist. Terry Egan looks back in his life.
30:34.300 - 30:39.720:  There was no more terrifying film in the early 1970s than the one with which that music,
30:39.720 - 30:47.760:  Michael Field's tubular bells, came to be associated. It was the horror film The Exorcist,
30:47.760 - 30:53.900:  directed by William Friedkin, who was part of the new Hollywood movement of exciting young directors,
30:53.900 - 30:59.900:  such as Francis Ford Coppola. But with tales of viewers fainting in the cinemas and because
30:59.900 - 31:05.000:  of the subject matter, dealing as it does with the possession of a young girl whose head at one
31:05.000 - 31:12.980:  point turns 180 degrees, it earned Friedkin a notoriety beyond any hit had so far. And yet,
31:12.980 - 31:17.980:  Friedkin was already one of Hollywood's best known directors. A couple of years earlier,
31:17.980 - 31:24.240:  hit directed Gene Hackman in The French Connection. And that film about a cock as ruthless as
31:24.240 - 31:29.940:  the drug dealers he's trying to find, but always thwarted in his pursuit, not least during a
31:29.940 - 31:36.140:  riveting car chase, had won five Academy Awards. Have you ever been in Pekipsi? Have you ever been
31:36.140 - 31:42.060:  in Pekipsi? Have you ever been in Pekipsi? Have you ever been in Pekipsi? Have you ever been in Pekipsi?
31:42.060 - 31:44.820:  Have you ever been in Pekipsi? Have you ever been in Pekipsi? I want to hear it! Come on!
31:45.400 - 31:50.620:  Brought up in Chicago in the United States, Friedkin began his career in television and with
31:50.620 - 31:56.360:  documentaries, directing one of the last episodes of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour. And once he got to
31:56.360 - 32:02.120:  The French Connection, his work on documentaries really told, enabling him to imbue the film with
32:02.120 - 32:08.200:  a bleak reality that set its tone. After the exorcist, came a short-lived production company,
32:08.200 - 32:14.780:  set up with other famous directors that he himself left, and then more films, not nearly
32:14.780 - 32:21.100:  so successful. An expensive remake of a French classic The Wages of Fear, called Sorcerer,
32:21.100 - 32:28.120:  was dramatically overshadowed at the box office by Star Wars in 1977, and the fortunes of his
32:28.120 - 32:34.040:  later work were equally overshadowed by the success of that film about an innocent young girl
32:34.040 - 32:40.820:  disturbingly manipulated by the devil, which was nevertheless nominated for ten Academy Awards,
32:41.560 - 32:49.340:  including Best Picture and Best Director. Terry Egan on the Director, William Friedkin,
32:49.340 - 32:56.800:  who's died at the age of 87. And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the
32:56.800 - 33:02.200:  Global News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covering it,
