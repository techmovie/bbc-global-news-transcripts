00:38.580 - 00:43.660:  I'm Andrew Peach at 13 GMT on Wednesday the 9th of August. These are our main stories.
00:44.300 - 00:49.160:  I witnesses say more than 40 migrants have been killed in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy.
00:49.800 - 00:53.820:  Nine bodies are found in a burned out holiday home for adults with learning disabilities
00:53.820 - 01:00.160:  in eastern France. Poland increases troop numbers on its border with Belarus as it says more migrants
01:00.160 - 01:08.880:  are trying to cross. Also in this podcast? Because of the three years of the pandemic, our incomes
01:08.880 - 01:19.380:  are not as stable. Consumer prices fall in China tipping the world's second largest economy
01:19.380 - 01:28.420:  into deflation. First, eyewitnesses say 41 migrants have drowned off the southern Italian
01:28.420 - 01:34.120:  island of Lampedusa after their boat capsized. Survivors say the vessel had set off from Tunisia.
01:34.600 - 01:41.380:  Our correspondent in Rome Sophia Batizi reports. We do know that 41 migrants died and they were killed
01:41.380 - 01:47.760:  in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy's island of Lampedusa, which is in the south of the country
01:48.060 - 01:55.160:  Sicily. This is all being reported by Italian media and by their news agency Ansa and they have
01:55.160 - 02:03.060:  spoken to the only four people who survived the shipwreck, three men and one woman from the
02:03.060 - 02:11.300:  Ivory Coast and from Guinea. What they said is that they were on a boat that had set off from
02:11.300 - 02:17.200:  Tunisia on Thursday. They were trying to reach Italy. They described it as a very small
02:17.200 - 02:25.580:  metal boat about seven meters long. They said that 45 people were on board and that includes
02:25.660 - 02:33.700:  three children. Now they said that only they were at sea for about six hours, which is not very
02:33.700 - 02:40.060:  long. They were sailing in the Sicilian Channel and that's when the boat capsized and sank.
02:40.500 - 02:46.560:  Apparently the boat capsized because of a very big wave that threw everybody who was on board
02:46.560 - 02:52.320:  into the water. Now the survivors said that out of the 45 people who were on that boat,
02:52.740 - 02:59.580:  only 15 of them were wearing lifestyles. They were left in in the water at sea for several
02:59.580 - 03:06.780:  hours before they were rescued by a cargo ship and brought to the island of Lampedusa today.
03:07.340 - 03:12.520:  Sophia Batizi in Rome. Nine people are known to have died following a fire at a holiday home,
03:12.520 - 03:17.840:  hosting people with learning disabilities in eastern France. The authorities say two people
03:17.840 - 03:23.000:  are still missing, but are also presumed to have died. This from our Europe Regional Editor Paul
03:23.000 - 03:28.080:  Moss. This was in the town of Vincentheim, which as you said is in eastern France very close to the
03:28.540 - 03:34.240:  the border with Germany. What we know is that a fire began there at about 630 when predictably
03:34.240 - 03:38.940:  most of the people and maybe all of the people there were asleep. It began on the ground floor.
03:39.420 - 03:45.160:  We understand people there were evacuated, 17 of them, although one needed very serious hospital
03:45.160 - 03:50.360:  treatment, but the people were trapped on the first floor and it seems that the bodies of
03:50.360 - 03:56.560:  nine have already been found to still missing. We understand that 10 of the people who appeared to
03:56.560 - 04:01.580:  have died were people who as you suggested had learning difficulties. They were there on a holiday
04:01.580 - 04:07.460:  and one of the missing was a supervisor who looked after them. The interior minister of France
04:07.460 - 04:13.300:  Gerard Daman√° has paid tribute to the rapid and courageous intervention by firefighters, but
04:13.780 - 04:19.860:  it seems that wasn't enough. Do the authorities have any understanding yet as to why this fire
04:19.860 - 04:24.580:  was so devastating? It seemed to spread through the building so rapidly. I think it's clear when you
04:24.580 - 04:28.840:  look at pictures from the scene. This was a building, a holiday home made in the traditional
04:28.840 - 04:34.280:  Al-Zaz region style, which means they're very pretty, but they're made of wood. When you look at it,
04:34.280 - 04:40.220:  you can see this charred timbers and this gutted roof, exactly the sort of place where a firewood
04:40.720 - 04:45.420:  spread very quickly. We've had word from Philippe O'illy-Aves, the commander in charge of the
04:45.420 - 04:49.800:  operation. He said they're having trouble still searching the building for those two bodies
04:49.800 - 04:55.520:  because there's a huge amount of rubble, and as he said, many collapsed sections. So I think it
04:55.520 - 05:00.220:  may be a while before anything could be established for sure about what happened and before those
05:00.220 - 05:06.940:  two remaining bodies are found. Paul Moss reporting. Having been reinstated as an MP after a two-year
05:06.940 - 05:12.400:  sentence for defamation was suspended, the Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has gone on the
05:12.400 - 05:17.620:  offensive. He's accusing the Prime Minister Narendra Modi of murdering Mother India through how
05:25.700 - 05:27.980:  he's responded to armed clashes in Manipur. It's a little of the reaction there, chance in the
05:27.980 - 05:33.440:  parliament of Modi to what Mr. Gandhi have to say. A correspondent in Delhi, right, Vendra Rao,
05:33.440 - 05:40.640:  is following the story. It was a no-holds-barred attack from Rahul Gandhi on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
05:40.640 - 05:45.940:  as he took part in this debate on the no-confidence motion which the opposition parties have brought
05:45.940 - 05:53.280:  against Mr. Modi's government. Now Manipur is one issue on which the opposition parties,
05:53.280 - 05:58.740:  they have been criticizing Prime Minister Modi for having maintained a complete silence,
05:58.740 - 06:05.580:  but for the occasion when he spoke briefly after a video went viral showing atrocities against
06:05.820 - 06:13.620:  a couple of women. As he took sentences today in the parliament, Rahul Gandhi accused Prime
06:13.620 - 06:20.640:  Minister Narendra Modi of murdering Mother India in the violent state of Manipur. He said,
06:21.140 - 06:25.740:  pointing towards the BJP legislators, he said that they killed India in Manipur,
06:26.080 - 06:34.720:  their politics killed India in Manipur, and he basically doubled down on that, saying that
06:34.720 - 06:42.200:  Prime Minister Modi did not go to Manipur because for him, Manipur is not a part of India. So all of
06:42.200 - 06:48.120:  these statements which Rahul Gandhi gave, they drew sharp responses from the treasury benches,
06:48.120 - 06:54.140:  there was a lot of uproar in the house, people from the treasury benches were trying to
06:54.560 - 07:00.520:  rebut and contradict what Mr. Gandhi was saying. So a lot of acrimony in the house till the time
07:00.520 - 07:05.180:  Mr. Gandhi was speaking. Lots of sound and fury, but in the end, does the Prime Minister Narendra Modi
07:05.180 - 07:10.920:  have control, have authority in the house? He still does. Well, absolutely, because BJP remember
07:10.920 - 07:18.060:  has a very commanding majority in the house in a legislature of 545 members, the half-way
07:18.060 - 07:24.920:  mark is 272, and the BJP on its own has more than 300 legislators there, and if you add their allies
07:24.920 - 07:30.580:  to them, the number goes up to around 330. So the fate of this no-confidence motion is already a
07:30.780 - 07:37.080:  foregone conclusion that BJP is going to sail through this rather smoothly. But for the
07:37.080 - 07:40.800:  opposition parties, this no-confidence motion is very, very significant and important,
07:40.800 - 07:47.460:  because through this no-confidence vote, they think that they will finally be able to force Mr.
07:47.460 - 07:53.640:  Modi to talk about Manipur, something which he has shied from doing so far.
07:54.220 - 07:59.040:  Well, Vendra Rao with me from Delhi. The end of the three-year Covid crisis in China was
07:59.040 - 08:04.440:  expected to see its huge economy bouncing back strongly, as restrictions were lifted on people's
08:04.440 - 08:09.920:  movements and on business activity. The response from Asia's economic giant has been sluggish
08:09.920 - 08:16.520:  at best, figures today, show consumer prices far by 0.3% in July compared with the previous year,
08:16.520 - 08:22.640:  the first deflation since early 2021, and there are fears that poor consumer and business
08:23.260 - 08:27.740:  confidence could send China into a long period of falling prices and stagnant growth,
08:28.160 - 08:30.060:  this from Steve McDonald in Beijing.
08:32.860 - 08:38.880:  The bustling scene on Beijing's vast underground train network is exactly what you'd expect
08:38.880 - 08:44.220:  for a modern city of more than 20 million people. At times during the Covid crisis,
08:44.680 - 08:50.700:  it was strangely quiet, though, with many working from home or choosing to stay indoors,
08:51.440 - 08:57.300:  these days, to zip Covid never happened. The case value this would seem to show an economy
08:57.300 - 09:02.540:  rebounding strongly. Well, analysts are telling us that's not actually the case.
09:07.020 - 09:12.120:  The crowded walkways leading from stations to shopping centres belive the fact that consumer
09:12.120 - 09:18.300:  spending, especially on big ticket items, has been quite weak here. People are nervous about job
09:18.300 - 09:22.720:  security or about the value of their homes, so they're saving more.
09:24.220 - 09:30.480:  Because of the three years of the pandemic, most people don't have as much money to spare,
09:30.480 - 09:36.360:  to even buy certain foods, drinks and clothes. They are just more cautious than before.
09:36.800 - 09:38.600:  Our incomes are not as stable.
09:40.960 - 09:46.120:  A woman running a shop selling pretty cheap pastries says she too is feeling the pressure.
09:48.020 - 09:53.660:  We don't have customers like we did before. People are buying less. We all know what the economy
09:53.660 - 09:57.540:  is like now. Everyone is spending money on what's important.
09:59.860 - 10:05.600:  Less spending and less confidence is pushing down prices on many products. In one way that may
10:05.600 - 10:10.380:  sound good, but there are fears the country could be heading into a period of deflation
10:10.380 - 10:16.500:  and with stalled business investment. Harry Murphy Cruz is an economist at Nude's analytics,
10:16.500 - 10:21.940:  specialising in China. If you're a household, you're thinking you're buying a couch. Well,
10:21.940 - 10:26.520:  if you think prices are going to keep falling, then you've got no incentive to buy this month,
10:26.520 - 10:31.240:  but rather hold off to next month. But because you've held off, that's pinching retailers,
10:31.880 - 10:36.380:  they start to cut their prices already and you sort of entrench the cycle that's
10:36.380 - 10:40.600:  incredibly difficult to break. On the outskirts of every major Chinese city,
10:40.600 - 10:47.120:  there are forests of tower blocks with flats that nobody wants. Real estate oversupply has driven
10:47.120 - 10:52.560:  down the value of family homes, hitting the biggest investment of ordinary people. The government
10:52.560 - 10:57.220:  doesn't want to make the situation worse, so it's been loathed to pump more money into
10:57.220 - 11:02.140:  propping up developers, but it needs a solution. Again, Harry Murphy Cruz.
11:02.520 - 11:06.300:  There's certainly more stimulus that's going to be needed to actually kick start the economy.
11:06.540 - 11:10.740:  And realistically, one of the key challenges for China's households is that property sector.
11:11.220 - 11:16.620:  So while that's still struggling, household spending is going to really crawl.
11:18.200 - 11:23.820:  Home renovation support tourism stimulus and means to encourage more electric car sales
11:24.340 - 11:28.060:  are all on the table. Ultimately, though, it might just be a matter of waiting.
11:28.840 - 11:33.700:  If the global economy picks up next year, this will drive international demand for the stuff China
11:33.700 - 11:41.040:  makes. Shot in the arm for production here will then feed back into global growth. So maybe China's
11:41.040 - 11:47.940:  policy makers will just try to ride out the next six months in the hope of better times ahead.
11:48.740 - 11:52.860:  Steve McDonald in Beijing. The latest in a series of typhoons that have been
11:52.860 - 11:59.640:  battering parts of Asia is slowly edging past Japan. The storm has winds of up to 144 kilometres
11:59.640 - 12:05.660:  an hour and is expected to bring record rainfall, mudslides and floods to Japan and then South
12:05.660 - 12:11.340:  Korea, which is expected to hit on Thursday. Asia Pacific Regional Editor is Jason Lee.
12:11.720 - 12:16.820:  It's killed at least two people last week in the southern Okinawa islands in the Pacific Ocean.
12:16.860 - 12:21.880:  Right now, thousands of homes are reported to be without power as heavy rain pounded
12:21.880 - 12:27.940:  to southern Kyushu Island. Because of the storm's relatively slow pace, rain clouds have
12:27.940 - 12:33.340:  lingered resulting in these substantial downpours, hundreds of flights have also been cancelled and
12:33.340 - 12:39.020:  Japan's shinkansen bullet trains, which are famous for their fast speed, have been halted in the
12:39.020 - 12:44.540:  southern areas. Now, the storm comes as the city of Nagasaki, which is located near the storm's path,
12:44.580 - 12:50.620:  marks the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the city, which has now been scaled down and
12:50.620 - 12:56.260:  moved inside. The Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also cancelled his attendance at the
12:56.260 - 13:01.020:  event because of this storm. Let's talk about South Korea. There have been all sorts of extreme
13:01.020 - 13:05.360:  weather events there. There's been extreme heat and this typhoon is expected to do quite a lot
13:05.360 - 13:09.840:  of damage when it arrives in South Korea. Yes, so it's expected to make landfall in South Korea
13:09.840 - 13:14.360:  on Thursday morning local time, but rains and winds are already growing in southern areas,
13:14.360 - 13:20.180:  as the storm draws closer to the Korean Peninsula. Authorities have issued highest alert and flights
13:20.180 - 13:24.920:  have been grounded on the southern Jeju Island and ships at the country's two biggest ports
13:24.920 - 13:30.220:  in Busan and Incheon are being evacuated. Now, it's worth mentioning that South Korea experiences
13:30.220 - 13:35.460:  typhoons regularly during its summer season, last months at least 47 people died due to
13:35.460 - 13:40.680:  torrential rains and floods, and out of those 47, we know that 14 of them died when an
13:40.680 - 13:46.040:  underpass was flooded in the city of Tongju. An inquiry launched after the incident found
13:46.040 - 13:51.280:  officials had ignored multiple flood warnings, so in order to prevent such tragic incident from
13:51.280 - 13:56.740:  occurring again, officials are putting extra focus ahead of this typhoon and warnings expecting
13:56.740 - 14:02.980:  vulnerable facilities such as drainage facilities and underground tunnels. Jason Lee reporting.
14:03.600 - 14:08.120:  Now to Texas and a story that's getting a lot of traffic online today, it's about a woman
14:08.120 - 14:14.740:  called Peggy who is just doing some gardening when she was attacked by a hawk and a snake at the same
14:14.740 - 14:22.040:  time. Here's Terry Egan. It could be a story out of the Bible or an Asop's Fable perhaps. Peggy
14:22.080 - 14:28.660:  Jones was happily mowing her lawn in a town in Texas near the Louisiana border when something
14:28.660 - 14:37.280:  fell out of the sky, a snake no less. As if that weren't bad enough, a hawk that was circling overhead
14:37.280 - 14:44.600:  clearly regarded that snake as its prey and wanted it back. Out of the sky, out of the clear
14:44.600 - 14:50.440:  blue, a snake fell onto my arm and he wrapped around my arm and just held on tighter. It kept
14:50.440 - 14:56.440:  striking in my face. He was striking my glasses. Just started praying out, Jesus help me please,
14:56.440 - 15:02.880:  Jesus help me. Eventually though, the hawk succeeded in dislodging the snake from Peggy's arm
15:03.240 - 15:09.060:  and her startled husband drove her to hospital. Peggy regards herself as lucky to have survived.
15:09.060 - 15:14.520:  There were punctual wounds, cuts, abrasions, scratches and severe bruising, she said,
15:15.460 - 15:20.320:  describing the attack as traumatic and adding that she thought she was going to die.
15:20.320 - 15:26.580:  And just in case you think this is a rare fluke occurrence, Peggy went on to say that living
15:26.580 - 15:33.160:  in rural Texas and having already survived a venomous snake bite, she's no stranger to wildlife
15:33.160 - 15:39.760:  encounters, but not usually quite like this one. Terry Egan reporting.
15:42.740 - 15:46.620:  Still to come in this podcast, the Russian authorities introduce a new school textbook,
15:47.120 - 15:50.560:  which includes justifications for the war in Ukraine. And
15:53.660 - 15:59.000:  the image on God save the Queen by the sex pistols for the Queen's eyes and mouth, hidden by the
15:59.020 - 16:04.240:  cut out words of the song's title is probably the defining image of Punk in the 70s.
16:04.480 - 16:06.500:  The man who designed that has died.
16:13.780 - 16:18.200:  Do you ever feel a bit overwhelmed when you check the news on your phone first thing in the morning?
16:19.400 - 16:23.520:  Whenever I open up my phone, they're just endless warnings of more extreme weather to come.
16:23.820 - 16:28.740:  I'm Hannah, I'm the presenter of a new podcast called What in the World from the BBC World Service.

17:20.160 - 17:25.320:  The US state of Ohio has rejected a Republican motion to make it harder to change the state's
17:25.320 - 17:29.280:  constitution, a move seen as a defeat for anti-abortion groups.
17:29.280 - 17:35.280:  Since the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections with Roe v Wade last year,
17:35.580 - 17:38.520:  states have raised to either protect or restrict abortion.
17:39.080 - 17:41.220:  Ohio will vote on abortion in November.
17:41.220 - 17:46.480:  Had this referendum passed, it would have made it harder for abortion rights to be protected.
17:47.020 - 17:50.200:  The Democratic Mayor of Columbus, Andrew Ginther, gave his reaction.
17:50.920 - 17:57.160:  People came out and sent a very strong message to an extremist supermajority in the legislature
17:57.860 - 18:04.120:  that they believe in fairness, they believe in freedom, and they believe in the power
18:05.480 - 18:07.140:  to hold them accountable.
18:07.660 - 18:10.480:  CBS correspondent Jared Hill told me more about the vote.
18:11.020 - 18:17.660:  This on the bout itself was purely about the threshold to change the state's constitution,
18:17.660 - 18:21.920:  going from, instead of 50% plus one vote to 60% vote.
18:21.920 - 18:24.540:  And we saw here, as you mentioned, that that got struck down,
18:24.920 - 18:26.920:  keeping with a 50% plus one.
18:27.320 - 18:32.400:  Now, while the abortion issue was not on the ballot, we do know that Republican lawmakers,
18:32.400 - 18:37.720:  she supported this change linked these two together as they were advocating and pushing for
18:38.000 - 18:38.860:  the adjustment there.
18:38.860 - 18:45.660:  So this definitely was, in the end, by and large, about the issue of abortion, at least largely
18:45.660 - 18:49.860:  within the state. There were some people who were speaking a bit more broadly about wanting to
18:49.860 - 18:54.840:  maintain the ability to vote the way that they have been voting for decades here, but really,
18:54.840 - 18:55.940:  this was about abortion.
18:56.080 - 19:02.700:  President Biden is pleased he's hailing this as a victory for those who want to protect abortion rights.
19:02.700 - 19:07.200:  What will the Republican legislature do in response to this, though?
19:07.480 - 19:11.720:  Yeah, so President Biden is really attaching himself to this, because again,
19:11.720 - 19:15.340:  you do have this 2024 vote coming up for presidency.
19:15.340 - 19:20.420:  And some recent CBS news polling has shown that Democrats, by and large, are more motivated to go
19:20.420 - 19:23.860:  to the polls around the issue of abortion than our Republicans.
19:24.220 - 19:28.020:  Now, when it comes to state Republicans in Ohio and what they do next, they're essentially
19:28.020 - 19:32.660:  accepting, right, that this is now the law of the land that this is the vote.
19:32.660 - 19:36.460:  They potentially could bring this up again, maybe not as early as next year,
19:36.960 - 19:41.660:  but at this point, they're saying that their focus really is going to be on trying to defeat
19:41.660 - 19:48.300:  the ballot initiative in November that would enshrine the right, the protections to abortion
19:48.300 - 19:51.960:  in the state constitution. So essentially, at this point, they've moved on from this.
19:51.960 - 19:56.840:  They'll take note of any shortcomings there might have been and really focus on
19:56.840 - 20:01.800:  making sure that abortion is not a part of the state constitution in Ohio in that November vote.
20:01.940 - 20:04.840:  And are we going to see processes like this playing out in other states?
20:05.180 - 20:11.280:  Possibly. So we have seen some attempts to get measures like this up for a vote in some other
20:11.280 - 20:15.980:  states though so far have failed, but we do again know that ever since the Supreme Court
20:16.340 - 20:20.180:  overturned the federal right to an abortion, said there was not a federal right to an abortion
20:20.200 - 20:24.460:  in the constitution, this has really been something that has popped up in a lot of states.
20:24.460 - 20:30.800:  And we've seen a lot of states where this has come up since then rejecting this notion that
20:30.800 - 20:36.300:  there should be a ban on abortion, at least when this is given up to the people and not just
20:36.300 - 20:41.540:  left up to lawmakers in those states. So again, this is an interesting test as we're continuing
20:41.540 - 20:47.140:  to see around how Americans on an individual level, once they go into the voting booth,
20:47.600 - 20:55.020:  are weighing the right to an abortion or in some cases the right to privacy as many of them
20:55.020 - 21:01.900:  might see it. CBS correspondent Jared Hill from Ohio to California and a judging Los Angeles
21:01.900 - 21:06.940:  has given a 10-year prison sentence to Tory Lanez, the man convicted of shooting the Grammy-winning
21:06.940 - 21:12.900:  rapper Megan Lee Stallion in the foot during an argument in 2020. It's a case with serious celebrity
21:12.900 - 21:18.420:  interest. Lanez is a hip-hop artist. They both made music addressing the issues. The shooting
21:18.420 - 21:23.480:  took place after the pair left a party at the home of reality star Kylie Jenner. The district
21:23.480 - 21:28.340:  attorney George Gascon said it also highlights the trauma experienced by survivors like Megan
21:28.340 - 21:34.180:  Stallion, his real name is Megan Pete. The fact that Miss Pete is a successful entertainer
21:34.180 - 21:41.040:  has brought his spotlight on the important issue of violence against women. There are many
21:41.040 - 21:45.700:  people in our community that endure acts of violence every day from people close to them
21:46.460 - 21:53.500:  and feel reluctant to come forward when this happens. I hope that Miss Pete's bravery gets
21:53.500 - 21:59.360:  hope to those that feel helpless. A correspondent in Los Angeles Peter Boes told me more about the case.
21:59.940 - 22:05.580:  Tory Lanez was found guilty in December of last year on three counts after the shooting of
22:05.920 - 22:12.320:  Megan Stallion. This followed a pool party at Kylie Jenner's home in the Hollywood Hills in 2020.
22:12.380 - 22:20.120:  The two of them had apparently had an argument. This is Tory Lanez and Megan about his musical
22:20.120 - 22:26.460:  ability. She claims that he then told her to dance and that's when she ended up being shot
22:26.460 - 22:32.220:  in the foot. Now, he maintained his innocence throughout his lawyer, said there'd been a botched
22:32.220 - 22:40.260:  investigation. But what we've just had, unusually long, two-day sentencing hearing, long because
22:40.260 - 22:45.800:  many people came forward, many letters were sent to the judge. Character witnesses speaking up for
22:46.580 - 22:55.340:  Tory Lanez in terms of his plea not to be sent to prison for this crime. He also spoke. He said
22:56.000 - 23:01.760:  of Megan. He said she is someone I still care for dearly to this day, regardless of what she may
23:01.760 - 23:08.740:  think of him. She said that he was the victim's friend and he talked about bonding with her
23:09.120 - 23:14.000:  over the loss of their mothers. We didn't hear directly from Megan in that she wasn't in the
23:14.000 - 23:19.180:  courtroom. She said she struggled with whether to appear in person but didn't for the sake of her
23:19.180 - 23:25.040:  mental well-being. But in her statement, she said since the shooting, she hadn't experienced a
23:25.040 - 23:32.480:  single day of peace and that he had shown no remorse. Peter Boes in Los Angeles. Now, can you remember
23:32.480 - 23:38.500:  the history you learned at school? School textbooks can be crucial to shaping a whole generation's
23:38.500 - 23:43.440:  perception of historical events. In Russia, authorities have unveiled a new school textbook,
23:43.440 - 23:48.980:  concluding justifications for the war in Ukraine and accusing the West of trying to break Russia.
23:49.420 - 23:57.920:  BBC Monitoring's Russia editor is Vitaly Shevchenko. The book presents Russia's history as a
23:57.980 - 24:09.100:  centuries-old struggle between Russia and aggressive West. Essentially, it's an example of how
24:09.100 - 24:17.200:  history is being weaponized in Russia because past events, real or imaginary, are being used to
24:17.200 - 24:25.140:  justify the current government's policies such as the war on Ukraine. To give you one quote that I
24:25.140 - 24:35.100:  think encapsulates the thrust of what the textbook says about Russia's most recent history. It
24:35.100 - 24:44.180:  argues that if President Putin had not started his so-called special military operation against
24:44.300 - 24:53.960:  Ukraine, this would have possibly been the end of civilization on planet Earth. And this textbook is
24:53.960 - 25:03.240:  full of very obvious manipulations and, well, untruths. To give you an example, it says that until
25:03.240 - 25:14.360:  2014, when Russia first attacked Ukraine, 80% of residents of Ukraine said the Russian language
25:14.360 - 25:21.840:  was their mother tongue. That's untrue, numerous opinion polls, surveys, and a census in 2001
25:22.680 - 25:28.140:  said that about a third of residents of Ukraine say that Russia is their mother tongue.
25:28.180 - 25:34.260:  It isn't uncommon for history to be told through the prison, through the lens of the nation where
25:34.260 - 25:39.240:  children are learning it. It sounds like this goes further than that though. It does. This is how I
25:39.240 - 25:48.280:  was taught history as well back in the Soviet Union. But this textbook, it feels kind of more relevant
25:48.280 - 25:55.360:  and more necessary for the government right now, which is keen to use this textbook to justify
25:55.360 - 25:59.980:  its war in Ukraine. This is the first such textbook to mention this book.
26:00.360 - 26:05.240:  Vitaly Shevchenko reporting, Poland is increasing troop numbers on its border with Belarus,
26:05.240 - 26:09.220:  as it says it's seeing an increase in migrants trying to cross in recent days.
26:09.220 - 26:13.420:  The Polish government has accused Belarus of facilitating the passage of the migrants.
26:13.980 - 26:17.320:  From Warsaw at Eastern Europe Correspondence, Sarah Rainesford has more.
26:17.920 - 26:21.980:  Poland has been talking about securing its eastern border a lot in recent weeks.
26:22.480 - 26:27.200:  First, increasing the number of border guards and now sending in additional 2,000 soldiers
26:27.200 - 26:32.960:  in support. That's as well as the giant metal fence that already separates Poland from Belarus
26:32.960 - 26:39.400:  and is covered with cameras and motion detectors. It appeared after 2021 when tens of
26:39.400 - 26:44.620:  thousands of migrants were encouraged to Belarus and then helped across the EU's eastern border,
26:45.220 - 26:50.980:  creating a political and humanitarian crisis here. The Polish government faces re-election in a
26:50.980 - 26:56.820:  couple of months and it's been talking tough on both migration and security. It also says it's
26:56.820 - 27:02.140:  worried that Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group now in Belarus might somehow start to help
27:02.140 - 27:08.500:  the migrants to cross. That seems unlikely. They weren't needed two years ago, but both Poland and
27:08.500 - 27:13.580:  Lithuania are keeping a close and wary eye on Wagner's movements across the border.
27:14.700 - 27:19.140:  Now taking health advice can be a struggle. There is good news today from two new reports.
27:19.140 - 27:23.860:  Once there's something as simple as eating nuts can reduce depression in adults.
27:23.860 - 27:29.180:  The other says we don't need to walk quite as far as we use to think necessary to improve our
27:29.180 - 27:35.060:  physical health. Here's Wendy Irkus. For years, thousands of us have been pounding the pavements,
27:35.060 - 27:41.820:  trying to reach that magic goal of 10,000 steps a day to stay fit and healthy. But new researchers
27:41.820 - 27:49.340:  found that walking just half of that could also save lives. Researchers followed 227,000 people
27:49.340 - 27:55.720:  for seven years to complete their study. What they found was that walking at least 2,300 steps a day
27:55.720 - 28:01.080:  was really good for the heart and blood vessels and the more people walked, the more they reduced the
28:01.080 - 28:08.100:  risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. And every 1,000 steps above the 4,000 steps mark
28:08.100 - 28:14.940:  brings down the risk of dying early by 15%. Now the man who crafted the image which came to
28:14.940 - 28:21.320:  define punk music, the artist Jamie Reed, has died at the age of 76. Let's look back at his life
28:21.320 - 28:29.920:  with our arts correspondent David Silito. The image on God save the Queen by the sex pistols for
28:29.920 - 28:34.840:  the Queen's eyes and mouth hidden by the cut out words of the song's title is probably the
28:34.840 - 28:40.300:  defining image of punk in the 70s. Jamie Reed had met the band's manager Malcolm McClaren at
28:40.300 - 28:47.380:  art school in Croydon. His lettering and the style of a cut and paste ransom demand was key to
28:47.380 - 28:52.280:  the pistols look. But this was just a small part of his life and work. Deeply political,
28:52.280 - 28:57.260:  Jamie Reed created banners, flyers and posters for dozens of protests over the years,
28:57.260 - 29:02.620:  taking on the poll tax, English heritage and the Gulf War with a lipstick wearing John Wayne,
29:02.860 - 29:09.260:  a radical to the end whose most notorious royal image is now hanging in the national portrait.
29:11.480 - 29:13.160:  Our arts correspondent David Silito
29:16.080 - 29:19.640:  and that's all from us for now. There will be a new edition of Global News later. If you want to
