00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service, with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:12.560:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
00:16.180 - 00:23.800:  Now you might have seen that Japan is releasing treated radioactive water from its tsunami hit Fukushima nuclear power plant.
00:23.800 - 00:28.520:  But how did the 2011 disaster happen? And could it have been prevented?
00:28.520 - 00:30.280:  It's on underwater.
00:30.280 - 00:35.000:  Station blackout reactor control systems have lost all power.
00:35.120 - 00:40.620:  Fukushima, a powerful podcast series from the BBC World Service, tells the story.
00:40.720 - 00:44.900:  Search for Fukushima, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:49.160 - 00:53.240:  There were very little representations when it came to people with disabilities.
00:53.660 - 01:00.100:  On the podium is the podcast with Olympians and Paralympians past and present, telling their inspirational stories.
01:06.540 - 01:10.640:  Listen now by searching for On the Podium, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
01:13.000 - 01:16.480:  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:19.580 - 01:20.720:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway.
01:20.720 - 01:24.940:  We are recording this at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 24th of August.
01:25.580 - 01:30.560:  A day after Russian mercenary boss Yavgeny Pregozhin was apparently assassinated in mid-air,
01:30.900 - 01:33.380:  we ask why the Kremlin is still keeping quiet.
01:34.200 - 01:39.780:  China's dream of building an alliance to challenge the West gets a boost as the BRICS nations invite
01:39.780 - 01:45.660:  another six countries to join. And there is strong resistance among the public towards Japanese
01:46.220 - 01:52.140:  seafood as these fresh fish are all from the sea and everyone is worried about the fish being contaminated.
01:52.860 - 01:58.860:  Concern in some Pacific nations as Japan begins releasing waste water from the rect Fukushima nuclear plant.
02:01.860 - 02:06.800:  Also in the podcast, flash floods in the Caribbean as tropical storm Franklin hits.
02:07.520 - 02:12.100:  And join me in making a commitment that on day one you would pardon Donald Trump on the
02:12.100 - 02:17.660:  only candidate on the stage, where the courage gets us there. That is how we move our nation forward.
02:18.140 - 02:22.180:  Republican presidential hopefuls take lumps out of each other in a TV debate,
02:22.640 - 02:24.180:  but the front runner is absent.
02:29.300 - 02:33.840:  After his mutiny in Russia two months ago, there was much amazement that the
02:33.840 - 02:39.980:  Wagner mercenary boss Yavgeny Pregozhin had been allowed to live. A day after his plane came down
02:39.980 - 02:45.900:  300 kilometers from Moscow, though, it is looking increasingly likely that Vladimir Putin has now
02:45.900 - 02:51.660:  taken his revenge. The first reports of the crash came in on Wednesday evening, as the Russian
02:51.660 - 02:58.000:  president attended a concert marking the anniversary of a famous Second World War battle. Mr. Pregozhin's
02:58.000 - 03:03.900:  ally said the private jet with seven Wagner leaders and three crew on board had been shot down by
03:03.900 - 03:09.960:  Russian air defenses, an echo of Wagner's attack on Russian military aircraft during the coup attempt.
03:10.760 - 03:16.120:  The Wagner boss has wrongly been reported killed before, so can we be sure he is now dead?
03:16.220 - 03:20.520:  Nina Khrushcheva is a professor of international affairs in New York and great
03:20.520 - 03:23.840:  granddaughter of the former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
03:24.240 - 03:29.500:  We know Pregozhin uses doubles, so there's not clear whether it was Pregozhin or somebody's registered
03:29.500 - 03:37.040:  as Pregozhin. Apparently there was a phone found, his phone found next to the plane, but if anybody
03:37.040 - 03:43.960:  knows how to evade Putin revenge, probably Pregozhin would know best. And as a theory is that
03:44.720 - 03:50.460:  finally the revenge has come to him, but the question is, why would it not be somewhere close to
03:50.860 - 03:55.820:  military actions in one of these countries? And Africa, where Wagner is, on the other hand,
03:55.820 - 04:03.660:  knowing Putin, he likes this big bang. He likes to show that his personal enemies do not escape.
04:04.400 - 04:11.420:  But more than 18 hours on, we still have no confirmation from the Kremlin. Why not? I asked our
04:11.420 - 04:16.000:  security correspondent Frank Gardner. Well, I'm not sure that the Kremlin has worked out how to
04:16.000 - 04:22.720:  handle this. The widely held assumption in the West, certainly, and indeed, I think, probably
04:22.720 - 04:29.980:  amongst some of Wagner's own members, is that this was a hit by the FSB, that's Russia's domestic
04:29.980 - 04:35.960:  intelligence agency, who is fiercely loyal to President Putin, and that this was a revenge dish
04:35.960 - 04:42.720:  served cold by President Putin to punish him for the mutiny, the mutinous march of June the 24th,
04:42.720 - 04:48.480:  where Pregozhin sent 5,000 troops towards Moscow and essentially challenged the entire Russian state.
04:48.480 - 04:55.020:  But we haven't yet seen any proof that Pregozhin's body has been found. We know that 10 bodies
04:55.020 - 04:58.800:  were recovered. They've been identified. We know that his name was on the manifest. He was
04:58.800 - 05:04.060:  expected to be on that plane. There is still an outside chance that he dodged it at the last minute,
05:04.060 - 05:09.300:  but since Russia is in charge of this investigation, they're keeping a pretty close lid on it.
05:09.540 - 05:14.300:  And what happens to Wagner now? We know they've been squeezed by the Russian military,
05:14.900 - 05:19.320:  losing their heavy weapons, and also there's some suggestion that the Russians are trying to
05:19.320 - 05:25.080:  take over their operations in Africa. Yeah, I think Wagner is finished as a force as it was,
05:25.980 - 05:31.580:  but the challenge for the Kremlin is how to capitalize on the progress that Wagner has made in
05:31.580 - 05:37.640:  extending Russia's interest in Africa without preserving them as a future challenge to the Kremlin.
05:38.220 - 05:42.960:  So Wagner have been very successful in establishing a pretty unpleasant and kleptocratic
05:42.960 - 05:48.840:  business arrangement with a number of regimes in Africa that essentially see them provide
05:48.840 - 05:54.960:  some pretty brutal security services in exchange for mineral rights, gold, diamonds, etc.
05:55.720 - 06:03.160:  The Kremlin won't lose that, but I'm seeing reports that Russian intelligence was already looking
06:03.160 - 06:09.000:  at ways of replacing Wagner in Africa with a rival mercenary force, possibly sharing some of
06:09.000 - 06:14.260:  the lower-level troops, but certainly replacing commanders because the Kremlin simply cannot risk
06:14.260 - 06:19.220:  a future challenge to its rule in the way that what happened on June the 24th.
06:19.380 - 06:25.640:  And what does all this mean for Russian morale amongst its fighters in Ukraine, and their supporters,
06:25.640 - 06:31.540:  because Pregozion was very popular as was the Russian general Sergei Tsarovikin who was sacked
06:31.540 - 06:37.200:  as the Air Force chief also on the same day that Pregozion disappeared. Well both those two
06:37.200 - 06:42.600:  were already out of the picture before this happened. So after the mutinous march and late June,
06:43.500 - 06:49.160:  it was announced that Wagner were withdrawing, in fact they had already pulled back from Bakhmut
06:49.440 - 06:52.260:  and said, right, it's over to the regular Russian army now, we're going to pull back,
06:52.260 - 06:57.880:  but we'll come back if needed. They then moved out largely across the border into Russia,
06:57.880 - 07:02.480:  some of them went to Belarus, some went to Africa, but they are no longer a force in Ukraine.
07:03.960 - 07:10.280:  When it comes to general Sergei Tsarovikin, he is perhaps the only really effective senior Russian
07:10.280 - 07:17.400:  general to operate in Ukraine. He is the guy that is credited for building Russia's incredibly
07:17.400 - 07:23.780:  strong defenses in the south of that country, the ones that are proving a major obstacle to Ukraine's
07:23.780 - 07:28.920:  country offensive. It's known as the Tsarovikin line. I mean, although he has a nasty reputation,
07:29.020 - 07:32.100:  he's known as General Armageddon for the fact that he flattened Aleppo when
07:32.740 - 07:39.040:  Wagner and Russia were operating in Syria. He was brave enough and a good enough soldier
07:39.720 - 07:44.640:  to go to the Kremlin in last year and say, look, we need to pull our forces out of Khursan,
07:44.960 - 07:50.260:  although we can't supply them. In the end, he lost his job and he's now been held
07:50.260 - 07:55.040:  reportedly under house arrest under suspicion of helping Pregozion do his march on Moscow.
07:55.760 - 07:59.040:  To answer your question, I mean, none of this is good for Russian morale. It shows that all
07:59.040 - 08:03.780:  is not well back home. Ukraine will be pleased by this. I don't think anybody in Kiev is going to
08:03.780 - 08:09.600:  shed any tears over the purported death of Pregozion because he led some of the fiercest battles
08:09.600 - 08:14.560:  against Ukrainian forces and let's not forget Wagner accused of human rights abuses,
08:15.260 - 08:19.340:  not just in Ukraine, but also in Syria and in a number of African countries.
08:19.980 - 08:26.180:  Our security correspondent Frank Gardner. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa
08:26.180 - 08:32.640:  already account for 40% of the world's population and a quarter of its GDP. Now their bricks
08:32.640 - 08:41.040:  grouping is getting bigger and richer by recruiting another six nations, Argentina, Egypt, Iran,
08:41.040 - 08:47.460:  Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It is a boost for China,
08:47.460 - 08:52.800:  the brick's most powerful nation which wants to build a counterweight to the West. Iran hailed its
08:52.800 - 08:58.440:  invitation as a success for its foreign policy. At the summit, the UN Secretary General Antonio
08:58.440 - 09:02.700:  Guterres said the world's current governance structures needed to be updated.
09:17.180 - 09:22.900:  Of the post-second world war. I asked our correspondent at the meeting in Johannesburg,
09:22.900 - 09:27.540:  Nomset, Miseko, what these six additional nations will bring to the block.
09:27.980 - 09:33.920:  They're going to be bringing oil, which is why I think that there was so many negotiations in
09:33.920 - 09:39.780:  terms of ensuring that these are the type of countries that the bricks block does actually
09:39.780 - 09:45.580:  admit. And foreign ministers of these countries are going to develop a bricks country model
09:46.160 - 09:51.120:  that will establish how the expanding bricks will be working together. In fact,
09:51.120 - 09:56.280:  the president of Brazil, Lula de Silva, said that the interest of other countries to join
09:56.280 - 10:02.720:  bricks showed how relevant in its pursuit for a new world order was also becoming.
10:02.720 - 10:08.580:  And Ethiopia has also made it into the group of big players, which was so much of a surprise.
10:08.760 - 10:15.660:  And also we do know that there was criteria that was sought and used by the original five members.
10:15.660 - 10:22.240:  And that was adherence to human rights and sanctions. So it remains unclear at the stage
10:22.240 - 10:28.540:  exactly how some members of this group, the new members, particularly were allowed in.
10:28.740 - 10:35.100:  Yeah, I mean, why no Nigeria, for example, or Indonesia, which would fit into the group very easily?
10:35.820 - 10:40.460:  Well, the understanding is that Indonesia pulled out at the last minute, but we still don't know
10:40.940 - 10:47.140:  the reason why that was the case. And we were given an indication that when the bricks
10:47.780 - 10:54.780:  block does meet in Russia next year, there is a possibility of further expansion
10:55.280 - 10:59.540:  with possibly the addition of Africa's biggest economy, Nigeria.
10:59.540 - 11:06.280:  In his comments, President Lula also said that globalization had failed. Do we know what this
11:06.280 - 11:13.680:  new expanded bricks, what its vision is? Well, the vision of this new bricks block is to ensure
11:13.680 - 11:19.240:  that they become a force that can be reckoned with in terms of geopolitics and that they can
11:19.240 - 11:24.920:  actually stand up against the West and lessen the power of the U.S. dollar end its use.
11:25.480 - 11:31.060:  No, I'm Sir Maseko in South Africa. 12 years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster,
11:31.060 - 11:36.220:  Japan has begun pumping more than a million tons of wastewater into the Pacific Ocean.
11:36.220 - 11:42.120:  A mix of contaminated groundwater and water used to cool the broken reactors,
11:42.120 - 11:47.360:  it's been treated before being released into the sea. The U.N. nuclear watchdog says that
11:47.360 - 11:53.120:  on-site tests have confirmed that levels of radioactive tritium in the water are safe.
11:53.120 - 11:59.160:  But not all of Japan's neighbours are convinced. China has suspended all Japanese seafood imports.
11:59.160 - 12:03.720:  This fish monger in Beijing says that are serious safety concerns.
12:05.220 - 12:09.400:  There is a significant decline in sales compared to before. In the past,
12:09.400 - 12:15.460:  including during the pandemic, we used to kill three to five tuna a week. But now we sell very
12:15.460 - 12:21.480:  few fish and we do not import from Japan anymore. We import fish from Australia, New Zealand or
12:21.480 - 12:26.940:  Spain instead, but the quality of the fish is not very good, not as good as Japanese fish.
12:26.940 - 12:32.760:  There is strong resistance among the public towards Japanese seafood as these fresh fish are
12:32.760 - 12:36.860:  all from the sea and everyone is worried about the fish being contaminated.
12:38.120 - 12:42.280:  When in the past few hours, there have been protests outside the Japanese embassy and the South
12:42.280 - 12:47.580:  Korean capital soul. From Fukushima, here's our correspondent Shima Heleil.
12:48.040 - 12:52.520:  Treated radioactive wastewater is being released into the ocean. Now we're not very far
12:52.840 - 12:57.020:  from the nuclear power plant. We can just about make out the chimneys.
12:57.020 - 13:03.460:  The wastewater is being pumped into a tunnel under the sea. It's about a kilometer long and then
13:03.460 - 13:08.900:  being released into the ocean. This is a significant day because it is the start of the process,
13:08.900 - 13:14.520:  but it is a very long process that's going to span many decades. They're predicting 30 years
13:15.000 - 13:20.020:  maybe longer. Within the first two weeks, so from now until two weeks, they're predicting that
13:20.020 - 13:26.420:  they're going to release about nearly 8,000 tons of this wastewater. Now it has caused a great
13:26.420 - 13:31.820:  deal of anxiety from the moment it was announced and of course on a day like today. The science says
13:31.820 - 13:36.560:  it's safe. The government says it's safe, typical. The company running the plan says it's safe.
13:36.780 - 13:43.300:  They've been processing this water diluting, it removing more than 60 radio nuclei. One remains,
13:43.300 - 13:47.500:  which is treating them. It's very hard to remove from water, but they say with the dilution,
13:47.500 - 13:54.180:  the fact that it's in the ocean, the concentration levels are going to be well below safety standards.
13:54.220 - 14:00.480:  That does very little to reassure people here in Fukushima and around the region. It's
14:00.480 - 14:05.680:  interesting. We're not very far from fishing port and the one fisherman that we wanted to speak to
14:05.680 - 14:10.720:  said, look, we've been told not to speak about anything today, but we've been here many, many times
14:10.740 - 14:15.880:  and those who have managed to speak to are really worried. They say we've suffered a great deal
14:15.880 - 14:22.400:  of reputational damage, perception of Fukushima fish, and it's taken us years to convince people
14:22.400 - 14:27.800:  to have our seafood. This release is like a second disaster to us. Many people are worried about
14:27.800 - 14:32.880:  what to feed their children. And of course it's not just here in Japan. China is angry.
14:32.880 - 14:39.500:  It's criticized Japan for using the Pacific Ocean as its personal sewer. South Korea,
14:39.940 - 14:44.280:  even though they've supported this plan, it goes against the public sentiment. People there are
14:44.280 - 14:48.500:  very angry and Hong Kong has issued a ban on Japanese seafood.
15:26.240 - 15:31.600:  At the moment, the situation is still very fluid. While the tropical storm has in the left
15:32.120 - 15:36.380:  humanitarian public, so it's upwards towards the Caribbean, there's still quite a bit of rain
15:36.380 - 15:40.680:  happening. So the assessments are still ongoing. We're still working very close with the
15:40.680 - 15:45.660:  government, but the last 24 hours have been extremely intense. There's about 22 communities
15:45.660 - 15:50.440:  without communication, which we're prioritizing. Unfortunately, there's been one death reported,
15:51.320 - 15:55.820:  and these are one of the things that we're, of course, the government is prioritizing on to make
15:55.820 - 16:01.440:  sure that we avoid as many casualties as we can. Talk us then through how those damaged
16:01.440 - 16:06.760:  infrastructures are hampering your humanitarian efforts. Every time that we have,
16:06.760 - 16:12.000:  no communication. So telecommunications is impacted. It's difficult to see what are the areas that
16:12.000 - 16:16.380:  are really needing that support. If the roads are affected, it's very difficult to carry out,
16:16.380 - 16:21.000:  not only assessments, but also searching rescue efforts. So what are your first priorities now?
16:21.780 - 16:26.520:  The priorities are ensuring that we can continue our logistical operations with the government,
16:26.520 - 16:31.340:  making sure that they can reach those places where and where required telecommunications to make
16:31.340 - 16:36.260:  sure that there is connectivity. And then we're all also quite working very closely with
16:36.760 - 16:40.680:  several defense and social protection, because we're trying to find out not only what the
16:40.680 - 16:45.480:  immediate needs are, but also we need to make sure in the medium or the short medium term,
16:45.840 - 16:49.180:  how can we reach large amount of population that will know will be affected.
16:49.840 - 16:54.640:  You mentioned that Gabriella that the hurricane season is approaching. There is still more to come.
16:54.640 - 17:00.020:  How are the island nations preparing for this? Usually the peak season for
17:00.340 - 17:05.440:  Espanola tends to be in September. I know what climate change things are changing things,
17:05.440 - 17:10.280:  or that shifts quite a bit. And sometimes we might get it a bit earlier a bit later. And we've been
17:10.280 - 17:16.580:  working or strengthening the government support systems, especially at the coordination level.
17:16.580 - 17:21.160:  So how can, let's say, the first responders better work together with the social programs?
17:21.160 - 17:25.740:  How can the information between the local communities get to the central government and vice versa?
17:26.220 - 17:32.460:  What's your worst worry? My worst worry would be, I think my worst worry would definitely be
17:33.180 - 17:38.220:  not being able to get to the most vulnerable in time. The longer you take to respond for those
17:38.220 - 17:41.460:  that are out of life and death, if it makes them a lot more vulnerable.
17:41.920 - 17:46.200:  The World Food Programs Dominican Republic Representative Gabriela Alvarado.
17:49.200 - 17:51.240:  And still to come on the global news podcast?
17:53.600 - 17:58.480:  Why you might just hear this sound in Northern Ireland for the first time in 200 years.
18:05.160 - 18:07.580:  I could feel stigma all around me.
18:07.660 - 18:10.760:  Nearly died three or four times. I had this secret.
18:11.140 - 18:16.600:  This is live's less ordinary, a podcast dedicated to remarkable personal stories.
18:16.800 - 18:19.400:  I started having a strength in me.
18:19.580 - 18:22.200:  Each week we hear tales of the unexpected.
18:22.220 - 18:25.280:  Walk in the shoes of some extraordinary people.
18:25.560 - 18:27.040:  It's something quite wonderful.
18:27.040 - 18:28.980:  Search for live's less ordinary.
18:29.320 - 18:31.180:  Wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
18:33.320 - 18:37.620:  For some, it might seem like presidential campaigning in the US never stops.
18:37.620 - 18:42.920:  But the first Republican TV debate last night marked the first big clash of the race.
18:43.460 - 18:47.760:  Donald Trump chose not to take part, but is sure to get all the headlines later today
18:47.760 - 18:52.980:  when he hands himself into the jailhouse to be booked over allegations of election fraud in Georgia.
18:53.680 - 18:58.480:  Despite his absence, the former president loomed large over the proceedings in Milwaukee.
18:58.480 - 19:03.020:  But that didn't stop the eight remaining candidates also attacking each other,
19:03.440 - 19:04.740:  as Gary O'Donohue reports.
19:13.660 - 19:18.040:  This was the first big chance for these candidates to tell the world who they are
19:18.440 - 19:20.540:  in this debate on the Fox News Channel.
19:21.020 - 19:25.480:  But it wasn't long before their loyalty to Donald Trump was put to the test.
19:26.160 - 19:29.680:  If former president Trump is convicted in a court of law,
19:30.220 - 19:33.080:  would you still support him as your party's choice?
19:33.640 - 19:35.680:  Please raise your hand if you would.
19:36.720 - 19:39.200:  Six of the eight on stage raised their hands.
19:39.200 - 19:43.120:  One of those two who didn't was the former New Jersey governor,
19:43.620 - 19:46.460:  and nowadays a vowed Trump opponent, Chris Christie.
19:55.560 - 19:59.540:  Donald Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, did raise his hand,
19:59.580 - 20:05.500:  but said he'd refuse to put Mr. Trump above the constitution when he certified the election
20:05.940 - 20:07.120:  and made the capital riots.
20:07.200 - 20:12.000:  But no one's above the law, and President Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence
20:12.000 - 20:17.140:  that every American is entitled to, and we will make sure and extend that to him.
20:17.620 - 20:20.680:  But in a pugilistic style that lasted throughout the night,
20:21.200 - 20:27.160:  Vivek Ramaswamy, a multi-millionaire entrepreneur who's vehemently defended the former president,
20:27.160 - 20:32.120:  challenged Mr. Pence on the question of a pardon if Donald Trump was convicted.
20:32.520 - 20:33.420:  Mike, why don't you say this?
20:33.420 - 20:37.580:  Join me in making a commitment that on day one you would pardon Donald Trump on the only
20:37.580 - 20:40.340:  candidate on the stage, where the courage gets to say it.
20:40.540 - 20:42.980:  That is how we move our nation forward.
20:42.980 - 20:49.160:  While all this was going on, Donald Trump was appearing in a pre-recorded interview on social media
20:49.640 - 20:55.700:  designed to go up against the debate, which had had 82 million views by the end of the evening.
20:56.360 - 20:58.100:  He was dismissive of the whole field.
20:59.000 - 21:02.700:  And I'm saying, do I sit there for an hour or two hours, whatever it's going to be, and
21:04.240 - 21:08.960:  get harassed by people that shouldn't even be running for president. Should I be doing that?
21:10.200 - 21:13.120:  Back at the debate, abortion was always going to be a major issue,
21:13.420 - 21:18.940:  following last year's Supreme Court decision to overturn a 50-year national right to a termination.
21:18.940 - 21:24.160:  Florida Governor Ronda Sanders has signed a six-week limit on abortions in his state,
21:24.160 - 21:28.120:  but wouldn't say whether he supported a national law.
21:28.320 - 21:31.500:  But just to be clear, Governor, would you sign a six-week ban federally?
21:32.360 - 21:37.100:  I will support the cause of life as governor and as president.
21:37.260 - 21:42.100:  Funding for Ukraine is a major point of disagreement between these candidates,
21:42.100 - 21:49.180:  some favoring continuing support, others like Vivek Ramaswamy saying no in inflammatory terms.
21:49.180 - 21:54.020:  And I find it offensive that we have professional politicians on the stage that will make a pilgrimage
21:54.020 - 21:59.140:  to Kiev, to their Pope, Zelensky, without doing the same thing for people in Maui.
21:59.360 - 22:04.360:  Former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, has little time for that, or seemingly for him.
22:15.040 - 22:18.040:  This was a largely gaff-free night for these candidates,
22:18.040 - 22:22.460:  but it was still the man not in the room that dominated the agenda.
22:23.140 - 22:27.120:  And while some will be pleased that they've managed to raise their public profile,
22:27.680 - 22:31.200:  they're still all miles behind Donald Trump in the polls.
22:32.640 - 22:34.500:  Gary Adonihoo in Middle-Walkie.
22:34.960 - 22:39.840:  Well, Matt Mowers is a former Republican congressional nominee and president of political
22:39.840 - 22:46.100:  strategy firm Valcott LLC. He was at the debate and spoke about the standout performers on the night.
22:46.580 - 22:50.100:  I think in these moments from debates where you're looking for us who distinguishes them
22:50.100 - 22:55.400:  so who stands out and who's going to be the talk of voters and the media the day after.
22:55.400 - 23:00.240:  And my mind watching it in the arena, three candidates had different moments and to very decrease.
23:00.240 - 23:04.620:  One, Nikki Haley invested at the Haley. I thought it did very well, acquitted herself well.
23:05.060 - 23:08.920:  She's been having a challenge getting momentum. I think after her performance tonight,
23:08.920 - 23:13.160:  she's going to get a look from voters. I think New Jersey governor Chris Christie went there and did
23:13.600 - 23:17.720:  exactly what he had intended and needed to do. Went out there and was the only candidate that actually
23:17.720 - 23:22.000:  talked about Donald Trump for the most part. And then I think the third one, and he certainly took
23:22.000 - 23:27.060:  some months was the Vekrama Swami. I mean, here's a guy who is at 0% just a few months ago and
23:27.420 - 23:31.720:  now is getting attacked more than Ron DeSantis who had entered the race as the co-front runner at
23:31.720 - 23:36.700:  one point and has fallen so far that none of the other seven on stage even thought to bring them up.
23:37.200 - 23:40.940:  It's just a touch where a lot of the Republican Party is these days. You know,
23:40.940 - 23:45.160:  folks are looking for outsiders. And so that's a piece of the Vekrama Swami's appeal.
23:45.160 - 23:50.400:  He's also, you know, willing to go out there and mix it up which and get himself in the news and
23:50.400 - 23:55.820:  do countless different interviews. There's an appeal to that as well. And look, he's a talented guy,
23:55.820 - 23:59.900:  but you know, I think he certainly took some lumps here tonight as well. At the end of the day,
23:59.900 - 24:03.740:  folks are looking for someone interesting and compelling to be a president, but they also want
24:03.740 - 24:09.260:  someone they believe is up to doing the job. When you're 38 years old and running for your first
24:09.260 - 24:14.060:  office ever, and it's the presidency of the United States, that bar is going to be even higher for
24:14.060 - 24:18.320:  voters. Look, the fact that he's in the middle of the stage and every other candidate was talking
24:18.320 - 24:22.960:  about him and not Ron DeSantis speaks volumes about where he stands the polls today.
24:23.360 - 24:28.500:  Political strategist Matt Mowers. The world's largest computer and video games,
24:28.500 - 24:33.460:  first of all, is underway in the German city of Cologne. Attendees get to play the newest games,
24:33.460 - 24:37.440:  meet developers and publishers and connect with others in the gaming community.
24:38.120 - 24:44.560:  Numbers heading to games come are expected to be even higher than the 265,000 who visited
24:44.560 - 24:50.400:  last year. The BBC's Laura Cress is there. You catch me. I'm just here at the entrance of the
24:50.400 - 24:58.460:  Colmes Center here in the heart of Cologne. Over 1,200 exhibitors here from 63 countries.
24:58.860 - 25:03.500:  So this isn't just a German event. People have come from all around the world to showcase your
25:03.500 - 25:08.780:  game. I would say one of the hottest tickets is the Xbox stand. There's a big, big stand
25:09.240 - 25:14.020:  they've got here in Cologne and they've got a game called Starfield, which is one of their
25:14.020 - 25:19.780:  biggest games of the year. It's all about outer space exploration and they've built this 300
25:19.780 - 25:24.940:  person theatre where the public can come and watch the first few minutes of the gameplay.
25:24.940 - 25:30.140:  So they're taking this very, very seriously. Nintendo is here, Xbox is here. Nintendo wasn't
25:30.140 - 25:34.840:  here last year. People were wondering whether they might mention something about their new switch
25:34.840 - 25:39.980:  console, which people are expecting to potentially come out next year. We haven't heard anything about
25:39.980 - 25:45.160:  that yet, but they are meeting with lots of games companies. This is not just a German
25:46.460 - 25:52.020:  gamescom. This is for 63 countries, over 1,200 exhibitors. It's a global global event.
25:52.520 - 25:58.420:  Laura Cress. Ospreys have returned to breed on the island of Ireland for the first time in more than
25:58.420 - 26:04.000:  200 years. Two adult birds and their chicks have been spotted in county for mana in northern Ireland.
26:04.000 - 26:10.560:  Beth Timmins has the details. This is not the first local sighting of Ospreys.
26:10.700 - 26:16.580:  Soaring birds of prey with long hazel-flect wings, white feather crowns and distinctive ice stripes.
26:17.260 - 26:22.260:  But the presence of at least two Ospreys chicks has raised hopes that these raptors can establish
26:22.260 - 26:28.120:  a permanent colony in Ireland. This successful breeding makes them the first known wild Ospreys
26:28.120 - 26:33.600:  chicks on the island of Ireland in modern times. Conservation group both to wildlife are keeping
26:33.600 - 26:39.820:  the nest site confidential to protect them. Over their lifespan of 15 to 20 years, these migratory
26:39.820 - 26:45.960:  birds can rack up more than 250,000 kilometres of travel, but they always return to the same area
26:45.960 - 26:51.500:  every year. Charles Knight, the environmental farming scheme advisor, who found them, said it was
26:51.500 - 26:57.920:  a rub your eyes once in a lifetime moment. Ospreys populations were threatened in parts of North America
26:57.920 - 27:03.880:  in the 50s and 60s due to the use of pesticides and chemicals like DDT, which thinned their
27:03.880 - 27:09.640:  eggshells and killed many birds. But after these substances were banned, most Ospreys populations
27:09.640 - 27:14.600:  were able to recover. The birds were thought to have become extinct as a breeding bird in Ireland
27:14.600 - 27:20.380:  in the late 18th century due to human impacts. Scientists say their return indicates a healthy
27:20.380 - 27:26.840:  Wattland ecosystem with plenty of fish like pike perch and trout to sustain what could be a new
27:26.840 - 27:35.700:  dynasty of Ospreys. Beth Timmins there. And that is all from us for now, but the Global News
27:35.700 - 27:41.040:  Podcast will be back very soon. This edition was mixed by Chesney Forks Porter and produced by David
27:41.040 - 27:45.420:  Lewis. Our editors Karen Martin, I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
27:54.080 - 27:59.700:  Now you might have seen that Japan is releasing treated radioactive water from its tsunami hit
27:59.700 - 28:05.840:  Fukushima nuclear power plant. But how did the 2011 disaster happen? And could it have been
28:13.020 - 28:18.440:  prevented? Fukushima, a powerful podcast series from the BBC World Service, tells the story.
