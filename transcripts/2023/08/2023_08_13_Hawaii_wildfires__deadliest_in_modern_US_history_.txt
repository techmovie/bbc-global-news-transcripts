00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.500:  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:19.480 - 00:24.080:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Monday the 14th of August.
00:24.620 - 00:28.960:  People in the US state of Hawaii appeal for more government help as they struggle to recover
00:28.960 - 00:35.600:  from deadly wildfires. Ukraine says Russia's navy breached international law when it held up
00:35.600 - 00:41.800:  a Black Sea cargo ship. And Iran's parliament votes to avoid a public debate over a new law on
00:41.800 - 00:50.600:  enforcing hijab wearing. Also in the podcast, the cool leaders in Niger tell visiting delegates they
00:50.600 - 01:02.760:  remain open to diplomacy and the English literature course on the lyrics of Taylor Swift.
01:07.700 - 01:14.140:  The governor of the US state of Hawaii says the burnt out tourist town of Lahaina is like a war zone
01:14.140 - 01:19.380:  after it was all but destroyed by fire. The cost of rebuilding has been put at five and a half
01:19.380 - 01:25.600:  billion dollars and people on the island of Maui are calling for more government help. The flames
01:25.600 - 01:31.140:  are now largely under control but thousands have been left homeless and people are still missing.
01:31.580 - 01:34.200:  Our correspondent Sophie Long reports from the scene.
01:37.180 - 01:42.100:  The road to Lahaina is packed with people desperate to reach their homes. Some want to
01:42.100 - 01:46.960:  search for missing loved ones. Others are trying to bring supplies to friends and family,
01:46.960 - 01:53.740:  left stranded without fuel or power or water. President Biden promised immediate help to those who
01:53.740 - 02:00.060:  survived but many islanders say it's not yet reaching those most in need. Felicia Johnson McKenzie
02:00.060 - 02:04.940:  has turned her t-shirt business into a drop-off and delivery depot for aid but she's been stopped
02:04.940 - 02:13.140:  from entering the devastated area. I'm frustrated. I am. We're one family. We need to take care of each
02:14.260 - 02:19.680:  their trump diced. They're upset. No one's giving hugs. Do you hear people in the same
02:19.680 - 02:25.460:  pants? It's a fire on Thursday? Kids in the same diapers since Thursday? People would out food.
02:28.560 - 02:33.740:  Felicia's extended family and friends help a load cars, trucks and trailers. They share her
02:33.740 - 02:38.840:  frustration not just with access but with attitude. It's almost like there are two Hawaii's.
02:38.940 - 02:42.960:  There is two Hawaii's right now. There is the Hawaii we're living in and the Hawaii they're
02:42.960 - 02:48.220:  living in. They're visiting in. Her daughter, Kalei Kamaka Johnson, is a medical student and works in
02:48.220 - 02:53.500:  a restaurant often serving tourists. Our people just died in three days ago or the same water is the
02:53.500 - 02:59.800:  very next day these visitors tourists were swimming in and it says a lot about where their heart
02:59.800 - 03:03.240:  in mind is through all of this and where our heart in mind is though. You don't see our people
03:03.240 - 03:08.560:  swimming, snorkeling, surfing. Nobody is having fun in tragedy. How long have you been waiting here?
03:09.080 - 03:14.340:  We heard that it was going to open when we were shopping. On the road to Lahaina as people continue
03:14.340 - 03:19.740:  to wait for frustration is building. From between noon and four we've been stuck over here.
03:19.960 - 03:22.760:  What do you think about the level of information you've been getting from the authorities?
03:23.460 - 03:29.280:  Extremely poor. Anybody that has a truck full of items should be able to access residents that
03:29.280 - 03:34.520:  need it. We're talking still about lives here. People need water. They need food.
03:37.440 - 03:41.060:  The thoughts of people around the world with those affected by this tragedy.
03:41.700 - 03:44.780:  There have been pleasures of many hundreds of millions to help them rebuild.
03:45.860 - 03:50.400:  But people here like Kalei Kamaka say they'll get through it by supporting each other.
03:50.700 - 03:53.800:  My family lost everything. My best friend in this whole world lost everything.
03:53.800 - 03:58.620:  She lost everything. She has no house, no car, no passport, no money.
03:58.620 - 04:04.420:  She is, and how are we coping with each other? That's all we can do. We can't do this alone.
04:04.500 - 04:09.540:  People who are alone right now in Lahaina, they're lost. Like my mom said, they're not even looking
04:09.540 - 04:13.240:  at the ocean. They're not looking at the mountain or the sky. They're just staring at the ground.
04:13.340 - 04:15.820:  We all hurt for our own people who have nothing.
04:16.460 - 04:22.760:  That report by Sophie Long, at least 93 people died in the fires making them the deadliest in
04:22.760 - 04:27.600:  America in more than a century. But the authorities are warning that that figure is likely to rise
04:27.600 - 04:33.560:  as I heard from John Sudworth in Maui. Police forensic teams are still searching the
04:33.560 - 04:39.380:  charred ruins of the homes and businesses inside Lahaina. And we know that they have really
04:39.380 - 04:46.400:  so far only covered a tiny fraction of those damaged and destroyed properties. So the death toll
04:46.440 - 04:50.900:  is expected to rise. The authorities have been very clear about that from the start.
04:51.720 - 04:57.340:  Meanwhile though, there are these other questions from many residents here in Maui about
04:57.340 - 05:03.100:  the adequacy of the US government relief effort, where there enough is being done to get help to
05:03.440 - 05:08.240:  those people still inside the disaster zone. And also other questions about what happens going
05:08.240 - 05:14.960:  forward. This island now faces a huge homeless crisis. Thousands of people left without homes as a
05:14.960 - 05:20.000:  result. Big questions about what's going to be done with them. Now we've heard some people in
05:20.140 - 05:27.500:  Lahaina unhappy at tourists carrying on their holidays in the area. But I guess it's tourism is
05:27.500 - 05:32.020:  an important part of the economy there. And what will it be like going forward?
05:32.380 - 05:35.920:  I think it's a really interesting question, that one. And it's a really difficult and complicated
05:35.920 - 05:43.180:  one. We are looking now at a major humanitarian crisis here. But as you say inside an economy,
05:43.180 - 05:48.620:  which is almost totally dependent on tourism and the inflow of thousands of people every year to
05:48.620 - 05:53.080:  enjoy this stunning coastline, and that will present, you know, in the face of homeless
05:53.420 - 05:59.680: ness crisis, in the face of the huge suffering here, really difficult, practical, political,
05:59.680 - 06:03.980:  and even moral questions going forward. There are no easy answers to that question.
06:04.700 - 06:11.440:  John Sudworth in Hawaii. Ukraine has accused Russia of carrying out an act of piracy in the Black Sea
06:11.900 - 06:16.360:  after a Russian warship opened fire on a cargo vessel off the coast of Turkey.
06:17.120 - 06:22.660:  The Sukhru Okan had left a Turkish port on Saturday and was heading north towards Ukraine when
06:22.660 - 06:28.200:  it was intercepted. The Russians fired warning shots and then boarded the cargo ship with a helicopter
06:28.200 - 06:34.360:  before inspecting it and allowing it on its way. It is the first such incident since Russia withdrew
06:34.360 - 06:40.240:  from a UN-backed deal allowing safe passage for Ukrainian grain exports. Our Europe regional
06:40.240 - 06:45.640:  editor, Danny A. Bard, told us more. Well, Russia has already attacked a Ukrainian port
06:45.640 - 06:50.980:  infrastructure since pulling out of the grain deal. It hits civilian ships in places like
06:50.980 - 06:56.360:  Odeska, Tronamore, the big seaports. It's also struck the port of Ismail, which is thought to be
06:56.360 - 07:01.200:  the point of destination of this ship. But the fact that it's the first time that it's targeted
07:01.200 - 07:06.220:  a civilian vessel heading for Ukraine, I think, is significant. Now, Ukraine's infrastructure
07:06.220 - 07:13.280:  has accused the Russians of trying to intimidate commercial shipping and all this feeds into the wider
07:13.280 - 07:18.600:  picture of tensions in the Black Sea, Oli, and fears for exports of things like food, stuff,
07:18.600 - 07:24.040:  but also other commodities. Yeah, because this wasn't a Ukrainian vessel, do we know who was
07:24.040 - 07:28.500:  operating it? Well, the vessel itself is flagged from Palau, but that seems to be a flag of
07:28.620 - 07:34.140:  convenience. Its home port is Istanbul, the Turkish biggest city, and the name of the ship is a
07:34.140 - 07:38.740:  Turkish name, so I think it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that there's a strong
07:38.740 - 07:43.700:  Turkish connection here, and Turkey, obviously, are keen to investigate the incident. We're not
07:43.700 - 07:48.920:  quite sure is actually how far off the Turkish coast this took place, but that's one of the things
07:48.920 - 07:55.080:  that the Turks will be looking into. Yeah, I mean, that could have problems for relations between
07:55.860 - 08:00.460:  Turkey and Russia, which have been quite important during the Ukraine war.
08:00.700 - 08:05.480:  They are. So President Erdogan, of course, played an important role in brokering the Black Sea
08:05.480 - 08:11.380:  grain deal in the first place. Ukraine has been trying to keep this back at some sort of
08:11.520 - 08:17.960:  exports going. Is Maile, which is the port we think the ship was heading for, is the biggest
08:17.960 - 08:24.540:  alternative port for Ukraine, but it's much smaller than the big sea ports. So it's of importance,
08:24.680 - 08:28.780:  what we know is that the Russians seem to have thought there was no prohibitive materials on
08:28.780 - 08:35.440:  boards, i.e. military supplies. You're a regional editor, Danny Eberhard. Voting has ended in
08:35.440 - 08:40.740:  Argentina, in a primary election scene as a kind of dress rehearsal for the presidential
08:40.740 - 08:46.760:  poll later this year. Candidates need to get more than 1.5% of the vote in order to progress,
08:46.860 - 08:52.120:  but since every adult in the country is required to cast a ballot, the primary gives a good
08:52.120 - 08:57.960:  indication of who will do well in the election proper. However, the Argentine economy is in
08:57.960 - 09:04.240:  dire straits, and many people are already disillusioned with politicians. I asked the BBC's
09:04.240 - 09:08.580:  Veronica Smink in Buenos Aires to tell us who to look out for in the primary poll,
09:08.580 - 09:14.220:  starting with the two main political blocs. In the last 20 years, Argentina has seen basically
09:14.220 - 09:19.220:  a political battle between the leftist perines coalition led by former President Cristina
09:19.220 - 09:24.620:  Kirsner and the center right together for change. Coalition led by the president who succeeded
09:24.860 - 09:30.140:  in the election. The interesting thing about this election is the first one without either one.
09:30.220 - 09:34.940:  So these coalitions are battling out again, but without their main leaders. The other thing is,
09:34.940 - 09:40.460:  as you said, till now, primers here were like a dress rehearsal because basically coalitions
09:40.460 - 09:44.920:  had decided who they were going to present, and there was just the one candidate. So it was
09:44.920 - 09:50.240:  basically like a big national poll. This time though, most candidates actually are going to compete
09:50.240 - 09:53.900:  against someone. So there is a lot of uncertainty this time around.
09:54.200 - 09:58.460:  But you will get an indication, I guess, from the blocs, even if they have more than one candidate
09:58.460 - 10:03.680:  about who might be in front ahead of the main election later this year. But there's also a
10:03.680 - 10:08.120:  surprise candidate who could come through the middle. Someone who's been described as more in the
10:08.120 - 10:14.420:  mold of Donald Trump or Brazil's Jaya Bolsonaro. That's right. Libertarian economist Javier
10:14.420 - 10:20.480:  Milé is the other big uncertainty of these primaries. So the main parent escalation has
10:20.480 - 10:26.180:  Sergio Masa, the current economy minister, as the main candidate. The opposition center-right
10:26.180 - 10:30.820:  coalition is battling out between a former security minister, Patricia Bullrich and the current
10:30.820 - 10:35.640:  mayor of Buenos Aires, Horacio Rodriguez Larreta. So we're waiting to see what happens there,
10:35.640 - 10:41.720:  but the big uncertainty is this far-right candidate Javier Milé, who, according to polls,
10:41.720 - 10:48.220:  might get even 20% of the vote or more. So really, this is the first time that these primaries
10:48.420 - 10:53.500:  nobody knows what to expect. Yeah, and it'll be interesting to see those candidates who do well,
10:53.500 - 11:02.160:  how they intend to deal with Argentina's many, many problems. Yes, 116% inflation. The peso has
11:02.160 - 11:05.920:  plummeted. It's one of the most evaluated currencies in the world and the second in Latin America
11:05.920 - 11:12.320:  after the Venezuelan Bolivar, four out of 10 people are poor. And there's this massive 44 billion
11:12.320 - 11:16.860:  debt with the IMF. So whoever comes in is going to have really, really hard challenges ahead.
11:17.380 - 11:23.380:  Veronica Smink in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires. The Iranian parliament has voted to
11:23.380 - 11:29.460:  avoid a public debate on a major new law on the hijab. Instead, it will be reviewed behind closed
11:29.460 - 11:34.740:  doors. The so-called hijab and chastity bill is intended to ensure compliance with the
11:34.740 - 11:39.760:  wearing of the hijab by women in response to months of mass protests triggered by the death
11:39.760 - 11:45.440:  of a young woman in the custody of the morality police. Our Middle East analyst Sebastian Asher
11:45.440 - 11:50.160:  told us more about the planned legislation. It's still got a way to go, but it essentially
11:50.160 - 11:56.480:  is now in the form, but it's likely to finally be passed. When it was mooted several months ago
11:56.480 - 12:00.640:  in response to these mass protests, which were a major challenge to the Iranian authorities,
12:01.340 - 12:06.320:  they finally faded out about five or six months, but the defiance continues amongst Iranian women
12:06.320 - 12:11.720:  very, very strongly. So there have been lots of efforts to reinforce the hijab to make it
12:11.980 - 12:18.020:  really mandatory, and a scene is very symbolic of what the Iranian Islamic Republic represent.
12:18.020 - 12:23.320:  They see it as more than just the hijab and vice versa. Originally, it was actually possibly
12:23.320 - 12:27.460:  softening the law and bringing it down to a misdemeanor, rather than a criminal offense,
12:27.980 - 12:32.640:  but the latest information that I've been seeing about actually seems to be raising it again and
12:32.640 - 12:37.260:  making the possibility of fines, which would really be punitive and the possibility of longer prison
12:37.260 - 12:42.560:  sentences. But that's all a little bit unclear still, although it was published in some form,
12:42.560 - 12:46.620:  what form it's actually in at the moment is not clear, and the fact that it's now going behind
12:46.620 - 12:50.240:  closed doors will obviously make that more opaque. But testing the waters of the Iranian
12:50.240 - 12:55.780:  authorities really, these extra enforcement are being carried out very from cities to cities,
12:55.780 - 13:00.160:  so in the more fundamentalist cities, you will see the Miranda police out on the streets.
13:00.560 - 13:04.980:  In Tehran, you won't see it to that extent. So they're seeing what kind of public pushback
13:04.980 - 13:09.880:  there is, and I think this is to avoid the possibility of that pushback building and building.
13:09.880 - 13:13.440:  That's what they are trying to avoid, I think, by doing this behind closed doors.
13:13.820 - 13:19.340:  On Middle East, unless Sebastian Asher. It has been described as the deadliest day in Egypt's
13:19.340 - 13:26.360:  living memory. On August the 14th, 2013, hundreds of people were killed on the streets of Cairo
13:26.360 - 13:31.640:  when security forces brutally dispersed a sit-in of thousands of protesters opposed to the military
13:31.640 - 13:36.620:  takeover. BBC Arabic Salina Bill in Cairo spoke to some of those who were there.
13:39.440 - 13:44.020:  This day, 10 years ago, Cairo turned into a war zone.
13:44.020 - 13:49.560:  The sound of gunfire, police sirens, and people screaming.
13:51.720 - 13:57.460:  When the Islamist president, Muhammad Mursi, was deposed by the army, his supporters gathered
13:57.460 - 14:05.540:  in the square of Rabal Adawiyyah and camped there for weeks. Then the security forces moved
14:05.540 - 14:13.840:  in to disperse them. In a matter of hours, hundreds of protesters were killed. The square was
14:13.840 - 14:22.440:  in flames. Life in Egypt has changed for good since this day. Politics has come under the full
14:22.440 - 14:29.280:  control of the military-backed president Abdel Fatihisi. There are also many Egyptians who say
14:29.280 - 14:35.920:  they have paid a very heavy price for the bloodshed this country witnessed back in 2013.
14:37.000 - 14:43.440:  10 years on, there are wounds that are still open and people who find it really difficult
14:44.040 - 14:45.580:  to get over their traumas.
14:48.300 - 14:53.920:  Amr was only 20 years when he took part in the sit-in. He says he never thought
14:53.920 - 15:01.560:  their gathering would be crushed so brutally. His face is covered in grief as he recalls that day.
15:03.320 - 15:10.100:  Dead bodies were everywhere. We couldn't save one another. A lot of kids lost their lives,
15:10.320 - 15:16.940:  and those were crushing people to death. I saw snipers shooting a queue of people who were
15:16.940 - 15:23.680:  raising their hands in surrender and leaving the sit-in. Humanity was killed in Egypt on that day.
15:25.300 - 15:32.420:  After spending five years in prison, Amr moved to the UK. He was among many protesters and
15:32.420 - 15:37.720:  members of the Muslim Brotherhood who either ended up behind bars or in exile.
15:40.120 - 15:46.520:  Muhammad Mursi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was the first civilian to be elected president
15:47.160 - 15:52.100:  after the overthrow of long-time dictator Hosni Mubarak in the Arab Spring.
15:52.840 - 15:57.000:  Mursi was removed from power after only one year in office.
15:58.740 - 16:03.720:  The authorities said his supporters occupying the square had an arsenal of weapons,
16:03.820 - 16:09.880:  something the Muslim Brotherhood deny. Although most of the victims were protesters,
16:10.500 - 16:13.420:  a few security personnel also lost their lives.
16:13.660 - 16:20.080:  What he tries to find solace in spending time with her grandchildren.
16:20.380 - 16:28.620:  Her son Mustafa, a junior police officer, was fatally shot two days after the clashes in the square
16:29.320 - 16:36.020:  as violence gripped Cairo. For three years, he was in a coma with wafer by his side.
16:36.780 - 16:41.220:  His medical condition was by far the worst among all police officers.
16:41.940 - 16:47.100:  Bereaved mothers came to visit me in the hospital and told me we are in a better position than you.
16:47.540 - 16:50.120:  At least the fate of our sons has been decided.
16:50.660 - 16:51.920:  They called him the living mortal.
16:54.500 - 17:01.560:  This dark chapter of Egypt's history is not over yet. Nowadays, Cairo is apparently calm,
17:02.240 - 17:06.740:  but a lot of anger and pain is brewing just beneath the surface.
17:08.180 - 17:12.900:  No member of the security services was ever held accountable for the bloodshed
17:13.600 - 17:16.940:  and divisions among Egyptians still run deep.
17:20.680 - 17:22.660:  Sally Neville reporting from Cairo.
17:25.760 - 17:27.920:  Still to come on the Global News podcast?
17:30.560 - 17:34.380:  We have seven of his trumpets. The one on display was actually given to him by King George
17:34.380 - 17:40.640:  V in England in 1934. A new exhibition dedicated to the jazz legend Louis Armstrong.
17:50.320 - 17:55.240:  The US-based Miss Universe organization, which hosts beauty pageants around the world,
17:55.240 - 18:00.860:  has cut ties with Miss Universe Indonesia after several contestants filed a complaint
18:00.860 - 18:05.600:  accusing the local organizers of sexual assault. An investigation is underway.
18:05.600 - 18:08.180:  Olivia Otaba has been following the story.
18:08.860 - 18:13.160:  Six Miss Universe Indonesia candidates have filed a police report
18:13.160 - 18:19.700:  accusing pageant organizers of sexual abuse. It details an occasion two days before this year's
18:19.700 - 18:25.420:  final in August, where a body check was carried out to look for scars and cellulite.
18:26.100 - 18:30.980:  It was allegedly during this exam where contestants were asked to strip off their clothes
18:31.000 - 18:35.320:  and photos were taken of them topless. During a press conference this week,
18:35.320 - 18:40.640:  one of the complainants detailed how she feels violated after the incident and is struggling
18:40.640 - 18:46.460:  with sleep. A lawyer representing the contestant said that while body checks were carried out
18:46.500 - 18:51.940:  in a closed room, they were men present and the door wasn't fully closed, which prohibited maximum
18:51.940 - 18:58.120:  privacy. So the parent company is Miss Universe organization and they have cut ties with the
18:58.120 - 19:03.900:  Indonesian franchise and its owner, Poppy Capella, saying it doesn't live up to the brand standards
19:03.900 - 19:09.860:  and ethics. In return, Poppy has said she had no involvement in the examination whatsoever and
19:09.860 - 19:15.940:  doesn't condone violence or sexual harassment. Similarly, Miss Universe Indonesia says it takes
19:15.940 - 19:22.100:  allegations of sexual misconduct very seriously and it is carrying out an investigation alongside
19:22.100 - 19:27.180:  police in Jakarta. And what does this mean for the pageant going forward?
19:27.480 - 19:31.380:  While Miss Universe might not be as popular as it once was in the West,
19:31.380 - 19:35.840:  make no mistake, it still has an enormous fanbase in Southeast Asia.
19:35.840 - 19:40.140:  Winners often go on to becoming celebrities and social media influencers,
19:40.900 - 19:46.160:  perhaps even more so than in the UK and US. So this pageant really has a potential to change
19:46.160 - 19:51.680:  people's lives. In fact, its owner is a transgender billionaire from Thailand and Jakra Dutertip.
19:51.820 - 19:56.520:  She is the first female owner and has taken huge strides in overhauling the brand,
19:56.520 - 20:01.220:  including allowing married women, transgender women and single mothers to compete.
20:01.220 - 20:06.440:  The relationship hasn't completely severed, though, as the Indonesian 2023 title holder will
20:06.440 - 20:10.860:  still be allowed to compete in the global Miss Universe pageant in November.
20:11.520 - 20:17.380:  Olivia, a table. Only last week, an Nigerian led delegation from the West African regional
20:17.380 - 20:23.980:  block ECOWAS was refused entry to Niger by the co-leaders there. But now a group of Muslim
20:23.980 - 20:29.660:  clerics from Nigeria who have met the junta in Niger this weekend say they are ready to talk.
20:30.480 - 20:34.640:  So could this be the big breakthrough everyone has been hoping for? Here's an African
20:34.640 - 20:40.660:  regional editor, Richard Hamilton. Ostensibly, this visit and promises by the military junta
20:40.660 - 20:46.500:  of being open to dialogues seem positive. After all, it's rare that outsiders manage to speak to
20:46.500 - 20:51.740:  them. Last Tuesday, the co-leaders denied access to another international delegation,
20:51.740 - 20:58.040:  saying their safety could not be guaranteed. But in reality, this latest move may just be
20:58.040 - 21:03.780:  Gamesmanship by the junta, so that if it comes to war, they can portray themselves as the victims.
21:04.760 - 21:08.360:  We still don't know what form military intervention might take,
21:08.360 - 21:13.940:  but it may be on a smaller scale than initially thought. Niger's ambassador to the US,
21:13.940 - 21:19.140:  Kiari Le Mansingiri, was asked what the international community should do next.
21:19.140 - 21:25.740:  I want them to support all the initiatives taken by our regional body ECOWAS.
21:25.900 - 21:32.560:  Propaganda is the military intervention, bland by ECOWAS, is against Niger, that's not true.
21:32.560 - 21:39.300:  The intervention is almost a police operation to free the president, kept hostage to free
21:39.300 - 21:43.820:  our legitimate institution, kept hostage. That's what it is about.
21:43.820 - 21:49.940:  The Muslim clerics were received in Niyame on Saturday. The junta told them it wanted unjust
21:49.940 - 21:57.080:  inhumane and unacceptable sanctions to be lifted. In return, the cleric stressed that Nigeria,
21:57.080 - 22:03.580:  ECOWAS' largest and most powerful nation, had no animosity against the people of Niger,
22:03.580 - 22:08.600:  and did not want to fight them. That, they said, would be like fighting their own kin.
22:08.700 - 22:14.280:  Nor the Nigeria and Niger are both dominated by the same house ethnic group,
22:14.280 - 22:18.580:  and there's growing unease there about the consequences of a conflict.
22:19.180 - 22:25.060:  Richard Hamilton, our African regional editor. A school in Cambodia has been temporarily closed
22:25.060 - 22:31.120:  after explosives, including more than 1,000 grenades were found in its grounds. They were unearthed
22:31.120 - 22:35.460:  when the school cleared land to expand a garden. The details from Electronicsmith.
22:35.880 - 22:40.800:  Video of the site in Krasie province shows tons of rusted explosives stacked up in rows.
22:40.800 - 22:46.140:  Grenade, rockets and anti-tank launches complete with missiles and warheads. The school was
22:46.140 - 22:52.040:  apparently the site of a military station during Cambodia's Civil War, which ended in the mid-1970s.
22:52.260 - 22:58.640:  Decades later, the country remains one of the most bombed and mined in the world. An estimated 20,000
22:58.640 - 23:04.100:  people have been killed, stepping on unexploded ordnance, clearance work continues to this day.
23:04.700 - 23:09.340:  Weapons experts say the discovery of the explosives is a huge stroke of luck for the students.
23:09.340 - 23:14.280:  You could easily have been blown up if someone had dug into them. Lucky for the students too,
23:14.460 - 23:16.440:  then they now get an unexpected holiday.
23:17.100 - 23:18.000:  Electronicsmith
23:18.800 - 23:23.060:  English literature students are normally used to studying the works of William Shakespeare,
23:23.060 - 23:28.820:  VS. Nipole, Tony Morrison and the like. But a professor at the University of Gent in Belgium
23:28.820 - 23:31.620:  has other plans for her master's students.
23:40.820 - 23:44.540:  Well, that is the singer Taylor Swift, who is currently performing to packed out
23:44.540 - 23:52.680:  audiences on her era's tour. Dr. Ellie McCorzland has devised a new module all about her writings.
23:52.680 - 23:55.540:  I asked Dr. McCorzland why Taylor Swift?
23:56.220 - 24:01.000:  Firstly, she's very popular at the moment. Her era's tour keeps making international
24:01.120 - 24:05.820:  news for various reasons. Secondly, there's a personal reason I've been a long-term
24:06.420 - 24:10.400:  fan of Taylor Swift. I have a very personal relationship with her music. And then the third
24:10.400 - 24:16.060:  reason is that I think there is a series of connections between Swift's work and English literature,
24:16.060 - 24:18.720:  which I just increasingly found impossible to ignore.
24:19.000 - 24:20.640:  Yeah, I mean, give us some examples of that.
24:20.760 - 24:25.200:  One of the things we're going to be looking at in my Taylor Swift course is the idea of
24:25.480 - 24:29.080:  narrative from different perspective. So this is something that has been a sort of trope in literature
24:29.080 - 24:34.560:  for a long time. In Swift's album Folklore from 2020, she has these three songs called
24:34.560 - 24:39.040:  August Bethy and Cardigan, which are essentially the same love story told from three different
24:39.040 - 24:42.400:  perspectives. It's a kind of love triangle. And that got me thinking about the ways in which
24:42.400 - 24:46.140:  this has been done in literature. So you've got the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. And then
24:46.140 - 24:50.720:  you've got Jean Reese's novel from the 60s wide Sargasso C, which is essentially Jane Eyre,
24:50.720 - 24:55.240:  but from the perspective of Bertha Mason. That is the mad woman in the attic, as she's often known.
24:55.420 - 24:59.220:  And would you have to be a Taylor Swift fan to get on with this course?
24:59.500 - 25:03.080:  No, absolutely not. I mean, I've made a big point of saying this. It's open to everyone.
25:03.600 - 25:07.280:  I would strongly encourage people who've maybe never heard of Taylor Swift or who don't like
25:07.280 - 25:11.380:  her music to join in because a, the focus of the course is still English literature and b,
25:11.380 - 25:15.780:  I'm really interested in inspiring debates. I really find it very exciting when students
25:15.780 - 25:19.540:  are enthusiastic and passionate. And that can often be passionate about something they dislike.
25:19.540 - 25:23.600:  And I would encourage that kind of passion. So it's absolutely not just for fans.
25:23.600 - 25:28.320:  It's open to everyone and the more diverse an audience we have in the course, the better I think.
25:28.740 - 25:32.900:  And could this kind of course be applied to other musical artists or is there something
25:32.900 - 25:38.080:  unique about Taylor Swift? Well, I want to say yes, it could be. I mean, I think there's no limit.
25:38.080 - 25:41.740:  It's certainly not confined to Taylor Swift. I think there's something about her music that is
25:41.880 - 25:46.260:  particularly literary quality. But of course, you know, Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize for literature.
25:46.260 - 25:50.260:  So she's not the first artist that one can make these connections with. But what I will say,
25:50.260 - 25:55.780:  she has a very large corpus of music to choose from. And she's very good at writing quite
25:55.780 - 26:01.180:  kind of generically diverse music. She really dives into different genres, different sort of themes,
26:01.180 - 26:05.480:  different aesthetics in her work. And that makes it particularly exciting from a literary point of
26:05.480 - 26:11.740:  view. Dr Ellie McCausland. Now, if you're a fan of Louis or as he preferred to be known Lewis
26:12.060 - 26:16.340:  Armstrong, you'll be delighted to hear that a brand new exhibition of the jazz legends
26:16.340 - 26:20.420:  possessions has opened in New York when the ear cart has the details.
26:32.600 - 26:39.620:  He was one of the most influential jazz musicians ever and his rich, gravely voices unmistakable.
26:43.040 - 26:50.120:  Louis Daniel Armstrong or Sachmo, as he became known, grew up dirt poor in a rough area of New Orleans.
26:50.840 - 26:55.860:  He made a name for himself as a cornet player on the Mississippi River steamboats and
26:55.860 - 27:01.880:  toward non-stop well into old age. In the early years, he spent a lot of time in Chicago
27:02.460 - 27:06.860:  and switched to the trumpet when he played with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in New York.
27:07.740 - 27:15.640:  In 1925, he formed Louis Armstrong at his hot five in Chicago, but had to flee to Europe in the 1930s
27:15.900 - 27:22.940:  after I run in with the Mafia. His return to America was well timed because jazz from the 1920s
27:22.940 - 27:29.720:  was back in fashion. Before long, he was an international star with a huge fan base, but the best
27:39.560 - 27:44.580:  was yet to come. Hello, Dolly was released in 1964. It went to number one in the charts,
27:44.580 - 27:48.660:  dislodging the Beatles from the top spot and won him a Grammy.
27:49.060 - 27:53.880:  He eventually settled in Queens, New York and although he died in 1971,
27:53.980 - 27:59.700:  Ricky Ricardi, whose director of research collections for the Louis Armstrong House Museum,
27:59.700 - 28:06.020:  says interest in the jazz musician never wanes. The Louis Armstrong House Museum is Armstrong's house.
28:06.060 - 28:09.720:  It's where he lived with his wife. We've seen it for the last 28 years. We get school groups
28:09.720 - 28:13.340:  every day. We get international visitors. We want to see the Armstrong House. We want to see how
28:13.340 - 28:16.920:  we live. Then we also have this incredible exhibit area, which has kind of the best of the archives.
28:24.940 - 28:29.640:  There's nothing quite as spine tingling as the trumpet at the beginning of summertime.
28:29.820 - 28:35.620:  And Ricky Ricardi says there's a few trumpets in the collection too. We have seven of his trumpets.
28:35.620 - 28:40.040:  The one on display was actually given to him by King George V in England in 1934.
28:40.520 - 28:47.080:  The man who is widely considered to be the founding father of jazz will be remembered for his unmistakable
28:47.080 - 28:51.200:  voice, his onstage charisma and his incredible talent.
28:58.120 - 29:00.480:  A report by Wendy Irkhardt.
29:03.680 - 29:07.780:  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
29:07.780 - 29:11.460:  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Emma Joseph,
29:11.460 - 29:15.800:  our editor's Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
