00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:20.640:  by advertising. That 56 seconds, it took me to swim that gold medal when I looked for that feeling
00:20.640 - 00:28.200:  for 30 years and I never found it. A podcast about the people behind the medals.
00:29.020 - 00:34.260:  On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:36.580 - 00:39.900:  This is the Global News Podcasts from the BBC World Service.
00:42.400 - 00:47.780:  I'm Gareth Barlow and in the early hours of Sunday the 27th August, these are our main stories.
00:48.460 - 00:54.340:  Spain's Football Federation has deleted a statement accusing a top-layer of misrepresenting reality.
00:54.960 - 00:58.720:  After she accused the head of Spanish football of kissing her without consent.
00:59.720 - 01:03.280:  One of Ukraine's best known fighter pilots has died in a mid-air collision.
01:04.140 - 01:08.500:  Krause and Washington have been marking the 60th anniversary of the pivotal civil rights
01:08.500 - 01:11.960:  march when Martin Luther King made his, I have a dream speech.
01:14.820 - 01:20.920:  Also in this podcast, I'm Zoe and I'm Amber. Why are you here? What two loves so much about
01:21.260 - 01:25.720:  Grand Prix? Mostly met with our loved atmosphere. Here it's like a big party.
01:26.240 - 01:29.520:  But why a car's not welcome at today's Dutch Grand Prix?
01:29.820 - 01:30.360:  Find out later.
01:34.180 - 01:39.740:  We begin in Spain and the country's Football Federation has deleted a statement from its official
01:39.740 - 01:45.320:  website, accusing the World Cup winning player Jenny Amoso of misrepresenting reality.
01:46.120 - 01:51.020:  She accused the head of the Federation Louis Rubialis of kissing her on the lips without consent
01:51.020 - 01:57.420:  after Spain's victory in the final last Sunday. The Federation ramps threatened her with legal action.
01:58.120 - 02:02.960:  Mr. Rubialis has faced a wave of condemnation for his actions but has refused to resign.
02:03.640 - 02:08.700:  On Saturday, 11 members of the national team's coaching staff quit in protest at his behaviour.
02:09.340 - 02:14.660:  Mr. Rubialis has been suspended from participation in football by the sports world governing body FIFA.
02:15.300 - 02:18.940:  From Madrid, his guy Hegeko. FIFA said it was suspending
02:18.940 - 02:23.720:  Luis Rubialis from all football-related activity, pending disciplinary proceedings, which had
02:23.720 - 02:28.640:  opened against him last week. The controversial kiss Mr. Rubialis gave Jenny Amoso
02:29.040 - 02:33.640:  has triggered a massive social and political backlash in Spain. Mr. Rubialis said he would not
02:33.640 - 02:38.940:  resign and insisted that the kiss was consensual. His Federation issued a document backing
02:38.940 - 02:44.360:  his claims by giving a detailed breakdown of the kiss itself and he has said he will take legal
02:44.360 - 02:50.420:  action to defend his reputation. Pedro Malabia Sanchez of the Spanish Women's Football League
02:50.420 - 02:56.560:  said Mr. Rubialis' response was not unexpected. This is part of the legal strategy. I think he knows
02:56.560 - 03:04.340:  that he is out but he will try to defend himself. I think society has massively refused this
03:04.400 - 03:10.440:  attitude. We don't want this kind of people in football and I believe it's very sad what has
03:10.440 - 03:16.020:  happened because he has stolen the biggest sports moment in Spain for many years,
03:16.020 - 03:21.020:  but maybe we can achieve something bigger than a World Cup with this changes.
03:21.360 - 03:25.760:  The government has said it is taking action to remove Mr. Rubialis from his post,
03:25.760 - 03:31.160:  a process which is expected to begin next week, although it's unclear if it will be successful.
03:31.840 - 03:36.580:  The World Cup winning squad has rallied round, Mr. Amoso and more than 80 professional female
03:36.580 - 03:41.280:  players are saying they will not represent their country until the Federation Boss is replaced.
03:42.100 - 03:45.740:  And almost all of the coaching staff of the team have resigned in protest.
03:46.680 - 03:51.900:  FIFA's involvement adds an international element to this case, which has already overshadowed
03:51.900 - 03:56.020:  the Spanish Women's team's celebration of their first ever World Cup victory.
03:56.740 - 04:02.040:  Now as Guy Hechco. Now to the United States, tens of thousands of people gathered in Washington
04:02.040 - 04:07.760:  on Saturday to mark the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights March, which culminated in Martin
04:07.760 - 04:13.720:  Luther King, Jr. giving his famous, I have a dream speech. The pivotal moment in US history was
04:13.720 - 04:18.500:  remembered by members of his family, along with dozens of campaigners who'd gathered in the city.
04:19.000 - 04:22.000:  Unorth America correspondent Peter Bowes listened to the speakers.
04:23.340 - 04:26.620:  No justice! No justice!
04:27.840 - 04:32.420:  Led by the Civil Rights leader, the Reverend Earl Sharpton, the crowd gathered at the steps of
04:32.420 - 04:38.420:  the Lincoln Memorial, where 60 years ago Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his impassioned,
04:38.420 - 04:44.080:  I have a dream speech. The Reverend Sharpton said the fight for Civil Rights was far from over.
04:44.220 - 04:51.380:  The dreamers will stand up. Black, white, Jewish, LGBTQ, we are the dreamers,
04:51.640 - 04:54.440:  where the children of the dream let us march.
04:54.580 - 05:01.200:  The 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom is etched in American history as a turning point.
05:01.740 - 05:05.800:  It helped pave the way for federal civil rights and voting rights legislation,
05:06.480 - 05:09.000:  and is seen as a watershed moment for black Americans.
05:09.800 - 05:14.820:  But while the country has changed, it's still wrestling with issues such as racial relations,
05:14.820 - 05:18.880:  equal voting rights, employment, and education opportunities.
05:19.200 - 05:23.420:  Dr. King's son, Martin Luther King III, addressed the crowd.
05:23.640 - 05:30.680:  Dad would probably say, now is the time. We must preserve, protect, and expand democracy.
05:31.420 - 05:35.600:  We must ensure that voting rights is protected for all people.
05:36.360 - 05:41.780:  We must ensure that our women and children are treated fairly.
05:42.480 - 05:44.920:  We must in gun violence.
05:45.740 - 05:50.940:  There have been dark moments since 1963, including recent cases of police brutality
05:50.940 - 05:53.360:  that have led to protests on the streets.
05:53.960 - 05:58.580:  Some of those marching in Washington said rather than being a mere commemoration of what
05:58.580 - 06:04.380:  happened six decades ago before many of them were born, today's March was a continuation
06:05.060 - 06:07.440:  of the struggle, by reports by Peter Bose.
06:08.420 - 06:13.140:  One of Ukraine's most celebrated fighter pilots has been killed in a mid-air collision,
06:13.140 - 06:14.740:  along with two other airmen.
06:15.160 - 06:20.400:  Andrew Pilschkeikov won fame taking part in close-range aerial battles over Kyiv during the
06:20.400 - 06:22.940:  early phase of Russia's invasion. His pool moss.
06:23.400 - 06:28.720:  He was the Ukrainian military-certed a young officer with mega knowledge and mega talent,
06:28.720 - 06:32.600:  and his death represented a painful and irreparable loss.
06:33.020 - 06:37.600:  The man who became known simply as juice was flying a training aircraft over the north of
06:37.600 - 06:42.040:  Ukraine when it seems his plane collided with another. An investigation's underway,
06:42.040 - 06:46.440:  but the accident serves as a reminder of the challenges involved in getting pilots ready
06:46.440 - 06:51.780:  for combat and quickly. It happened just as Ukraine's air force prepares to start training for
06:51.780 - 06:58.300:  newly-denated F-16 fighter planes, with aviation experts warning that can take many months to complete.
06:58.300 - 07:04.400:  The voice of pool moss. Next to southern Syria and anti-government protests have continued for
07:04.400 - 07:12.680:  seventh day. The demonstrations were initially sparked by an increase in fuel prices and
07:12.680 - 07:16.640:  worsening living conditions, but have evolved into anti-government protests,
07:16.640 - 07:22.400:  with demonstrators reviving slogans from the so-called Arab Spring protests of 12 years ago.
07:23.000 - 07:26.560:  I heard more about the background from our Arab affairs enlist, Mike Thompson.
07:27.580 - 07:32.400:  You mentioned the fuel price rises there, which were caused by subsidy cuts the government
07:32.400 - 07:37.380:  introduced, but it's the whole cost of a living problem. It's getting really difficult there.
07:37.380 - 07:41.640:  I mean, many people find that they don't go to work. They won't want to go to work anymore,
07:41.640 - 07:47.500:  because the transport is more expensive than what they get paid. Sometimes electricity may be just
07:47.860 - 07:53.800:  three hours a day, and the constant inflation, which never seems to reduce,
07:53.900 - 08:00.120:  means that people are just struggling to stay afloat. And a bit like happened actually in 2011
08:00.120 - 08:04.260:  before the war, now you've got this again, and in some ways you could say it's worse.
08:04.800 - 08:11.100:  Syria is a mosaic of government control, government opposition. It's a patchwork of support or
08:11.100 - 08:16.700:  lack of for Bashar al-Assad. Is there any significance in where these demonstrations are taking place?
08:16.940 - 08:20.900:  Well, coming to that point, you just made in a second. I mean, you can start with the fact that
08:20.900 - 08:25.700:  it's the range of places where the protests are taking place. Up in the final of the west,
08:25.700 - 08:32.280:  there's been many there near Idlib and Aleppo, but also down in the south. And down there we've got
08:32.280 - 08:40.540:  Swede province, which is Drew's population, and they have been giving pretty much tacit support
08:40.540 - 08:46.140:  to President Assad throughout the war, and he's left them pretty much alone, and yet now they're
08:46.140 - 08:50.860:  really rebelling against him. And, of course, in the neighbouring data province,
08:51.480 - 08:57.300:  there we've got the place where it all started in 2011. And as you mentioned in your introduction,
08:57.300 - 09:03.600:  the same sort of cries of down with President Assad bringing out and the same agitation and fury.
09:03.600 - 09:09.580:  Assad, though, managed to bomb, gas, bludgeon, bully his way into remaining in power for the
09:09.580 - 09:14.180:  last 12 years, supported by the Russians. How serious could this be to him? Or do you think he
09:14.180 - 09:18.900:  would just deploy the same tactics if he feels required? Well, we're now in the seventh day of protests,
09:18.900 - 09:23.740:  and protests have been quite rare in Syria, in government-controlled areas anyway. But they seem
09:23.740 - 09:29.280:  to be carrying on. We have the biggest demonstration of the week, the biggest number of people,
09:29.640 - 09:35.340:  and we've even seen that the Aloyte sect, which is the president's own sect, they've been rebelling
09:35.340 - 09:41.200:  as well. And I think when you mentioned there, might he resort to the same suppression tactics he
09:41.200 - 09:47.360:  used before, the brutality? I think if he does, then we could start to see the possibility of
09:47.360 - 09:51.520:  something much more widespread and dangerous for him happening. We'll follow the developments
09:51.520 - 09:57.100:  closely, that was Mike Thompson. This week marks two years since the last American troops left
09:57.100 - 10:02.320:  Afghanistan, yielding complete control to the Taliban. They took over promising to govern
10:02.320 - 10:07.840:  differently from their harsh rule of the 1990s, the first time they were in power. Some people
10:07.840 - 10:13.680:  think their latest incarnation is even worse. Ahead of the anniversary, one of the founders of the
10:13.680 - 10:18.760:  Taliban in Afghanistan has told BBC News that the vast majority of its members don't actually agree
10:18.760 - 10:23.320:  with the decrees preventing girls from attending secondary school and university. Well,
10:23.320 - 10:27.440:  at Amadur Salams, I have said many of them were also posed to a ban on women working in some
10:27.440 - 10:32.560:  workplaces and hoped this would soon change. He was speaking to our chief international correspondent,
10:32.560 - 10:39.700:  Lisi Set. It's rare for senior Taliban to speak out in this way. Mullah Zayev no longer holds
10:39.700 - 10:45.940:  an official position, but his remarks echo the few Taliban who take issue in public and many more
10:45.940 - 10:52.740:  in private, with some of the decrees proclaimed by their supreme leader, Habatullah Akunzada. Mullah Zayev
10:52.740 - 10:58.840:  emphasized that Taliban unity mattered. That's why change could only come from the very top.
10:59.460 - 11:05.580:  But he insisted that the Taliban of today are different from when they ruled harshly in the 1990s.
11:17.800 - 11:23.660:  Mullah Zayev's advice to the Taliban was to open girls schools as soon as possible. His advice
11:23.660 - 11:29.180:  to the international community was to support Afghanistan, to help it remain safe and stable.
11:29.260 - 11:35.940:  But he was bitterly critical of the 20-year-long US-led engagement, saying it had left the country
11:35.940 - 11:42.600:  in a terrible state. The Americans destroy our economy of Afghanistan. They have to continue
11:42.600 - 11:46.980:  their support in Afghanistan because they are responsible for the situation. Many Afghans say
11:46.980 - 11:52.200:  Taliban rule is now worse than the first time they governed. Many insist they'll never change.
11:52.800 - 11:57.040:  That was least he said. Still to come?
11:57.460 - 12:02.160:  residents of Lloyd Krabat are asking themselves who would possibly do such a thing.
12:02.680 - 12:05.620:  The collection box belongs to a local climbing club.
12:06.040 - 12:10.360:  So how did the perpetrators conquer one of Switzerland's most challenging climbing routes
12:10.660 - 12:13.040:  at over 2,000 metres to get the money?
12:18.780 - 12:23.300:  From their battles on the world stage, I gave everything for that race and I was able to come away
12:23.300 - 12:27.780:  with something that I've dreamed about since I was a kid. To their battles behind closed doors.
12:27.780 - 12:33.860:  I had to reach some terrible bottoms in my addiction and suffer some really terrible consequences
12:33.980 - 12:38.140:  and suffer a lot of loss due to my drinking to get to where I am today.
12:39.300 - 12:43.860:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympians and Paralympians share their stories.
12:43.860 - 12:48.900:  On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
12:49.840 - 12:53.000:  Now let's bring you back to the Global News podcast. In India,
12:53.000 - 12:58.360:  police are investigating an online video in which a primary school teacher is seen telling her
12:58.360 - 13:03.260:  peoples to slap a Muslim classmate. The boys filmed crying while he's being struck,
13:03.260 - 13:06.540:  allegedly forgetting his time's tables wrong. His Richard House.
13:07.500 - 13:12.260:  The incident happened on Thursday at a private school in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
13:12.720 - 13:17.620:  The teacher, who's now facing charges, is seen saying to her class that all Muslim children
13:17.620 - 13:23.660:  should be beaten. Slaps are heard as the pupils follow her order. The images have provoked outrage
13:23.660 - 13:29.240:  on social media. The opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the governing Hindu nationalist
13:29.240 - 13:35.280:  BJP of stoking up religious intolerance across India. The boys' father has taken his son
13:35.280 - 13:40.100:  out of the school. The teacher claims the video has been edited. Richard House there.
13:40.960 - 13:45.560:  Researchers in Britain are looking for a group of South Asian women who were given radioactive
13:45.560 - 13:51.580:  material largely without their knowledge back in the 1960s as part of a study looking at iron
13:51.580 - 13:56.860:  absorption. The women were told to each a parties a type of flatbread common in South Asian cuisine
13:56.860 - 14:02.380:  that themselves then contained a radioactive substance. Harry Blime is following the story.
14:03.440 - 14:10.680:  1969 in the city of Coventry in Central England. 21 women of Indian origin were given radioactive
14:10.680 - 14:17.680:  chapattis once a day by their doctors. It was part of a study into iron deficiency among South
14:17.680 - 14:23.300:  Asian people which suspected their diets were to blame. These flatbreads contained a radioactive
14:23.300 - 14:30.520:  isotope of iron called iron 59. One of those women was Pritamb Kaur, who featured in a 1995
14:30.520 - 14:36.840:  channel 4 documentary. He told her that this chapati will help you to find out what you're
14:36.840 - 14:42.460:  really lacking. He said somebody will come and see you at your house and give you this chapati
14:44.060 - 14:48.840:  and you eat it for a few days then we will take you and check you out.
14:49.120 - 14:54.300:  That's Miss Kaur's son speaking to John Brownlow in his documentary. After eating the bread,
14:54.300 - 14:59.900:  these women were taken to a research facility and tested to measure how much radiation they had
14:59.900 - 15:05.140:  absorbed from eating the chapattis. The problem here is that several of the women involved,
15:05.140 - 15:10.520:  including Pritamb Kaur, say they were not aware of the study that the chapattis were radioactive,
15:11.300 - 15:15.820:  nor did they consent to be part of it. It's believed many of these women had recently
15:15.820 - 15:28.680:  immigrated to Britain and spoke limited English. The study was funded by the Medical Research
15:28.680 - 15:35.100:  Council, part of the UK Government's research and innovation body. Tywo Oatemi is a member of
15:35.100 - 15:41.540:  Parliament representing Coventry and a qualified pharmacist. On Thursday, she raised concerns about
15:41.540 - 15:46.900:  the experiments in a post on social media, saying the recommendation of an earlier independent
15:46.900 - 15:52.540:  inquiry to identify the women affected was never followed up. She said she was working with
15:52.540 - 15:58.640:  the researcher to identify the women. In a statement, the MRC said it remained committed to the
15:58.640 - 16:03.340:  highest standards, including commitment to engagement, openness and transparency.
16:04.000 - 16:09.520:  A report by Harry Blyh. Kenyra's transport minister has sacked the head of the airport's
16:09.520 - 16:14.840:  authority after a power cut on Friday evening left passengers stranded in darkness for hours at
16:14.840 - 16:19.680:  Nairobi's main airport. Passengers shared photographs on social media of people using
16:19.680 - 16:24.460:  torches on their phones to get around. The majority state-owned power company has not
16:24.460 - 16:29.660:  explained exactly what caused the country-wide power cut. Many homes and businesses across the
16:29.660 - 16:34.680:  country were without electricity for more than 15 hours. This is what Kip Chumamakerman,
16:34.680 - 16:41.380:  the transport minister, told reporters on Saturday. At no time did we have an eye out of darkness
16:42.080 - 16:48.080:  on the runway or the tower. Over the last few years, Kenyra reports authority
16:48.920 - 16:55.000:  has faced a series of mishaps occasioned by management challenges and political interference.
16:55.800 - 17:00.560:  Our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross, is in the King in Capital Nairobi and described his experiences.
17:01.640 - 17:08.180:  I was at home, suddenly the lights went off and the generator kicked in, a large rumbling from
17:08.180 - 17:13.980:  outside. Then woke up this morning to find out that it had been not a kind of run-of-the-mill
17:14.060 - 17:21.780:  power cut, but in fact many passengers had been stranded at the international airport here in Nairobi.
17:22.600 - 17:28.260:  Quite unusually, the power cut was pretty much country-wide and then people I've spoken to
17:28.680 - 17:33.540:  throughout the day here have really been pretty fed up at the fact it's gone on for so long.
17:33.540 - 17:38.680:  So we've got the generators back on again where I am now. You might be able to hear in the background
17:38.680 - 17:44.900:  a slight rumbling, but of course for many people across the country there isn't the option of a generator
17:44.920 - 17:51.540:  and it's a struggle. So quite a lot of frustration and people asking questions and then we've also
17:51.540 - 17:55.580:  had, of course, some explanations from the government. And so what have the government been saying?
17:55.580 - 18:01.860:  What is the cause of this? Well, we haven't had much from the actual power company which is majority
18:01.860 - 18:08.720:  owned by the state, but we have had a press conference from the transport minister, Kit Chumbamur
18:08.720 - 18:16.160:  Common, who basically apologized to all those air passengers who were stranded at Jomo Kenyatta
18:16.160 - 18:22.000:  airport for several hours in the darkness and then he announced that several senior civil aviation
18:22.000 - 18:28.460:  authority officials had either been sacked or had been moved to smaller airports and some of his
18:28.460 - 18:33.540:  speech was was pretty extraordinary really. He started blaming political interference for
18:34.000 - 18:39.620:  what he called a demoralized and disorganized workforce at the airport and in the civil aviation
18:39.620 - 18:44.920:  authority. And that sort of points to the fact that this isn't just a usual power card. He's
18:44.920 - 18:50.300:  suggesting there's more to it than that. And of course Kenyans here are pretty quick to wonder
18:50.300 - 18:55.720:  whether there is corruption involved in all of this. And the transport minister made another
18:55.720 - 19:02.160:  rather strange comment in his speech where he said that two generators were procured for the airport
19:02.160 - 19:09.380:  more than two years ago and he said as a result of this pretty serious power outage those generators
19:09.380 - 19:13.560:  are now going to be commissioned which of course leaves you wondering what on earth they were
19:14.160 - 19:18.920:  doing where they were for the last more than two years after being procured why they weren't in
19:18.920 - 19:26.540:  place. The minister did point out that the airport runway and the control tower were not affected
19:26.540 - 19:33.860:  by any of this so he was kind of playing down any safety fears. But once again you know it does
19:33.980 - 19:41.180:  make you wonder just what the unanswered questions are. We'll Ross there in Nairobi. Now let's take
19:41.180 - 19:45.740:  you to Switzerland because there's shock in the country over a theft in the Alps at an altitude of
19:45.740 - 19:51.140:  about two thousand three hundred and fifty meters. The perpetrators conquered one of the country's
19:51.140 - 19:55.800:  most challenging protected climbing routes to break into a collection box. I'd you need a
19:55.800 - 20:01.360:  correspondent image and folks reports. Residents of Lloyd Krabata are asking themselves who would
20:01.460 - 20:07.560:  possibly do such a thing. The collection box belongs to a local climbing club which maintains
20:07.560 - 20:14.440:  free of charge the high altitude route. Reaching the box is possible only for very experienced
20:14.440 - 20:21.400:  climbers. There are vertical rock faces to ascend and gorges to be crossed using narrow steel
20:21.400 - 20:27.960:  cables. It's believed the thieves planned the robbery in advance. They took tools with them to
20:27.960 - 20:35.300:  smash open the box and then apparently continued their climb with the stolen money to the two thousand
20:35.300 - 20:42.140:  nine hundred meter high summit. So how much money has disappeared over five hundred dollars
20:42.140 - 20:48.020:  says the local climbing club. But today there was some consolation on hearing of the robbery
20:48.020 - 20:52.680:  a well-wisher sent in the same amount to replace what was stolen.
20:52.680 - 20:59.280:  Image and folks for the third time in a row Formula 1's two-time world champion Max Verstappen
20:59.280 - 21:05.080:  has taken pole position ahead of today's Dutch Grand Prix. A huge home crowd have arrived to
21:05.080 - 21:11.020:  support him in the seaside town of Zandvoord which has banned Formula 1 fans from arriving by car.
21:11.020 - 21:17.880:  The event is aiming to be that great oxymoron the most sustainable race on the F1 calendar. Almost
21:17.880 - 21:22.700:  all cars are the racing cars will be prevented from traveling to the circuit with spectators
21:22.700 - 21:27.520:  expected to arrive by public transport, bicycle or taxi and a hologon reports.
21:29.380 - 21:35.680:  Fans have been flocking to the Dutch F1 by bicycle. This is a petrol head event without the
21:35.680 - 21:43.160:  usual levels of petrol and that's because the town of Zandvoord is mostly shut down to vehicles with
21:43.160 - 21:51.640:  just a few exceptions. So the orange army is here propelled by pedal power and a desire to see
21:51.640 - 22:00.300:  the homegrown hero Max Verstappen in action. I'm Zoe and I'm Amber. Why are you here? What do you
22:00.300 - 22:06.920:  love so much about Grand Prix? Mostly Max but I love the atmosphere. Here it's like a big party.
22:07.200 - 22:11.420:  We call it the festival in the Netherlands and it's like we all are one and the speed.
22:14.280 - 22:19.740:  Same and the sound of it. I think that's really amazing. What does it sound like?
22:20.060 - 22:29.160:  Your ears are more like meh. Your ears are always pretty. You're partly deaf after it but it's
22:29.160 - 22:33.580:  all worth it. Well you know one of the other things that's kind of changing here is that
22:33.980 - 22:39.080:  they're encouraging people to come by foot or by bicycle to try to make an event that is
22:39.080 - 22:44.620:  notoriously bad for the environment a little bit greener. Are you conscious of that because
22:45.320 - 22:54.660:  it's an issue. I'm conscious. I go by train myself and it's like you go by bike. There's a lot
22:54.660 - 23:00.520:  of opportunities to go from everywhere in the Netherlands to go here with a bike and they try to
23:02.040 - 23:07.780:  make a car of driving by car to here. I don't know if you say that. It's interesting because
23:07.820 - 23:13.860:  it's attractive. It's less attractive. The three of us came together and they also like it's
23:13.860 - 23:20.900:  impossible to come here with a car so we mostly pick the train because we're not like from here so
23:20.900 - 23:27.820:  it takes us about an hour to come here. Having this green reduction she says is like it's making
23:27.820 - 23:34.300:  people aware. Like we are trying to make things better. Almost a third of supporters are expected to
23:34.300 - 23:40.780:  arrive by public transport. It's about a third by bicycle or mopeds and the rest by coaches,
23:41.360 - 23:46.360:  cabs and alternative modes of transport. More trains have been pushed on. A train is running
23:46.360 - 23:52.300:  between Amsterdam Central and Sanford. Every five minutes there's a whole fleet of electric buses
23:52.920 - 24:00.880:  and bike parking is everywhere. Of course one part of Sanford isn't going green and that is
24:00.940 - 24:09.820:  the race itself. F1 globally is under enormous pressure to try to improve its green credentials.
24:10.640 - 24:18.100:  There is a goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2030. Efforts promoted by the Dutch
24:18.100 - 24:22.820:  demonstrates how tracks can do more to preserve the environment without sacrificing
24:22.860 - 24:29.200:  pleasure or profits. These examples though many of them will be hard to replicate in countries
24:29.200 - 24:35.920:  that haven't yet developed a cycling culture and infrastructure to support green travel ambitions.
24:37.160 - 24:38.800:  That was Anahologin with that report.
24:41.900 - 24:45.500:  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
24:45.500 - 24:49.980:  a little later on. If you want to comment on this one or any of the topics do send us an email.
24:49.980 - 24:55.980:  The dress is globalpodcasts at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x of course
24:55.980 - 25:00.700:  for me known as Twitter. It's at Global News Pod. This edition was mixed by Chris
25:00.700 - 25:05.220:  de Blackwell. The producer was Liam McChefery, the editor of Caramarton. I'm Gareth Barlow.
25:05.300 - 25:06.440:  Until next time, goodbye.
