00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.900:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.720 - 00:23.180:  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Monday 7th August, these are our main stories.
00:23.180 - 00:28.660:  Niger's military readers close the country's airspace after a deadline from regional leaders
00:28.660 - 00:34.360:  threatening possible military action elapses. Rescue teams in Pakistan are trying to free people
00:34.360 - 00:40.960:  trapped in the wreckage after a train derailment which left dozens dead. A BBC investigation
00:40.960 - 00:47.500:  reveals shocking levels of mistreatment in a care home in Kenya. Many have died of hunger here.
00:48.480 - 00:52.760:  They denied them lunch and dinner or because they don't make time to come and feed them.
00:55.680 - 01:01.340:  Also in this podcast, Donald Trump alleges he won't get a fair trial in a case of election fraud
01:01.340 - 01:08.160:  because of the judge who he claims is highly partisan. And girlpower rules as Barbie makes a billion
01:08.160 - 01:14.380:  dollars. Ensuring Greta Gerwig becomes the first solo female director to pass that milestone.
01:19.820 - 01:24.700:  First to Niger, where the leaders of last month's coups say they've closed the country's airspace
01:24.700 - 01:30.260:  in response to the threat of military action against them. It comes after the passing of a seven-day
01:30.260 - 01:35.680:  deadline issued by the regional grouping ECOWAS, which had called on the coup leaders to restore
01:35.680 - 01:41.760:  the ousted president or face a possible intervention. Earlier thousands of people gathered in the main
01:41.760 - 01:46.000:  stadium in Niamé, the captain of Niger, in support of the coup leaders.
01:52.000 - 01:57.260:  Our reporter in Ketchia Gbona is monitoring the situation from Lagos in neighboring Nigeria.
01:57.740 - 02:03.960:  At the end of the ultimate, and we had expected a swift move of action or some mega-announcement,
02:04.080 - 02:09.840:  what ECOWAS seems to be silent on what its next move would be. So we're yet to hear from the
02:09.840 - 02:16.900:  block. But earlier today, pro-call supporters in Niger, gathered at the stadium in Niamé,
02:16.900 - 02:25.400:  the capital city, Chanson anti-France slogans, and cheering at the military junta leaders as they
02:25.400 - 02:31.440:  arrived to the arena. And do we know if that was spontaneous or if these people were bussed in,
02:31.440 - 02:37.940:  and this was arranged? No, we cannot confirm that, but we do know that the pro-supporters had been
02:38.400 - 02:46.520:  rallies in the last three days in support of the coup leaders who today emphasized that
02:46.520 - 02:53.320:  they were not backing down and they were not releasing power to ousted president Mohamed Basum,
02:53.320 - 03:00.120:  who is still held hostage at the presidential palace. Within ECOWAS itself, there are varying
03:00.120 - 03:07.300:  views, aren't there about how this crisis should be tackled? Exactly. First off, Ghana has said
03:07.300 - 03:14.360:  it supports the move to restore democracy in Niger, but it did not explicitly say if that move
03:14.360 - 03:20.540:  would include a military option. Ivory Coast and Senegal have said they would support a military
03:20.540 - 03:29.060:  move if the need arises, but Miley and Burkina Faso, which are also currently led by military
03:29.060 - 03:36.040:  officers who overtook democracy and forcefully ousted their respective presidents, have joined forces
03:36.040 - 03:43.080:  with Niger to say any military intervention or Niger would be met forced with force,
03:43.320 - 03:49.860:  but some of Nigeria's lawmakers have said a military intervention in Niger would be detrimental,
03:49.860 - 03:56.320:  especially because of the border states that Nigeria has with Niger. Housing a lot of displaced
03:56.320 - 04:02.540:  presence, refugees and some of them are actually leaving in Niger, going to decade-long Islamist
04:02.600 - 04:05.180:  and jihadist movements in that part of the country.
04:05.520 - 04:11.420:  Ketchi Agbona, well, the BBC's Krupa Paddi managed to get through to a resident in Niger's capital,
04:11.420 - 04:17.860:  Niyami. People in Niyami, they're not feeling good. They are very anxious. The situation is
04:17.860 - 04:25.420:  difficult. In the past week, since the ECOWAS put the embargo on our country, all the efforts
04:25.420 - 04:30.960:  met over the last decade would be destroyed by this school. The price or everything is going up,
04:31.320 - 04:36.380:  and the population cannot afford it. People are not able to share their opinion freely.
04:36.860 - 04:41.120:  If they do, they get arrested, so they don't speak up because of fear.
04:41.880 - 04:47.580:  When you are at home and you turn on the TV or you turn on the radio locally, what do you hear
04:47.580 - 04:54.300:  and what do you see? The reporter, they must report the military. Nobody can speak freely. People
04:54.300 - 04:59.140:  can speak freely on the radio or television. They are first regionalists and the reporter
04:59.140 - 05:05.020:  to support them. That's what it is. And are people going about their day-to-day lives as normal?
05:05.020 - 05:10.860:  I know you said that there is a fear to speak. Yeah, for now. Yeah, people are going to go to job as
05:10.860 - 05:16.780:  normal, but what you cannot do, you cannot freely give an opinion. That's what it is.
05:16.780 - 05:22.600:  If you don't support the military, you need to stay home or to hide somewhere.
05:23.140 - 05:26.540:  What do you think will happen in the coming weeks or what's your biggest fear?
05:26.940 - 05:32.380:  I don't see any sign for them to back down. And you know our country cannot support the
05:32.380 - 05:38.860:  Echoes embargo. So that's mean if they don't back down, the Echoes don't have no choice but to
05:38.860 - 05:43.860:  enter the military. You cannot protest against the coup. They're going to shut you down if you do.
05:44.480 - 05:49.620:  Because remember, the first time people did that, the first day of the coup, they shot people.
05:50.460 - 05:54.160:  A resident in Niger's capital Niyamei speaking to Krupa Paddi.
05:55.360 - 05:59.960:  In southern Pakistan, an operation is underway to rescue people still trapped in a railway
05:59.960 - 06:05.800:  carriage from an express train that was derailed some 250 kilometers north of Karachi.
06:05.800 - 06:11.120:  At least 30 people died and dozens were were injured when the Hazari Express crashed.
06:11.600 - 06:15.980:  Around a thousand people were on board the train. This man was taken to hospital
06:16.400 - 06:17.640:  are to be injured in the crash.
06:20.540 - 06:26.200:  It was so sudden and we were sitting comfortably until then. We heard growling sounds and I
06:26.200 - 06:31.640:  gather that the train had derailed. Then a storm of dust spread. Then a birth fell on my head
06:31.640 - 06:37.320:  and there was blood. Tarabaskar from the BBC Urdu Service in Lahore told me more.
06:37.760 - 06:43.800:  It's approximately 10 compartments of the train derailed and there were total of 19. So there's
06:43.800 - 06:49.300:  a huge number that got stuck in the incident. Rescue teams are also struggling and because it's
06:49.300 - 06:56.020:  a remote area according to officials, they have somehow cleared 90% of the compartments but
06:56.020 - 07:01.040:  they're still working on one compartment that is actually badly damaged and people are still stuck
07:01.040 - 07:07.400:  in that compartment. Officials actually asked nearby districts to send heavy machinery so that they
07:07.400 - 07:13.800:  can cut those heavy metal sheets off those compartments to take out people who are stuck inside.
07:14.140 - 07:19.880:  Has it become clear why this express train derailed? Do we know yet what happened?
07:19.880 - 07:24.800:  Initially the officials actually said that there might be two possibilities. One is that there
07:24.800 - 07:29.060:  can be a technical or mechanical issue and the other one is there might be some foreign
07:29.060 - 07:33.820:  hand that actually deliberately tried to create this incident but now they're saying that it
07:33.880 - 07:38.340:  looks like that there is a technical and mechanical fault and what do we know about the Hizara
07:38.340 - 07:44.760:  Express? Well, this is a train that takes passengers from Karachi that is in synth provence of
07:44.760 - 07:51.000:  Pakistan towards Punjab that travels on daily basis and there have been questions raised by a
07:51.000 - 07:55.840:  lot of people and authorities as well about infrastructure of Pakistan railways because these
07:55.840 - 08:02.080:  tracks are approximately 150 years old. They don't have that capacity through which you know a high
08:02.080 - 08:10.100:  speed trains can move on with excessive aid. Tahu Bhaskar. A BBC investigation into the care of
08:10.100 - 08:15.600:  the elderly in Kenya has uncovered the mistreatment and neglect of vulnerable residents to care
08:15.600 - 08:21.320:  home near the country's capital Nairobi. The World Health Organization says life expectancy across
08:21.320 - 08:27.240:  Africa has increased by almost 10 years in the last two decades and Kenyans like many others across
08:27.240 - 08:33.140:  the continent often now look for outside help. But even with Kenyan government standards and
08:33.140 - 08:38.980:  guidelines governing care homes there's a growing fear that in some cases the last thing that elderly
08:38.980 - 08:47.160:  people are receiving is care. In Jerry Moanga reports. The number of elderly residents in Kenyan
08:47.160 - 08:55.200:  care homes is increasing but what kind of care are they really receiving? BBC Africa I began to
08:55.200 - 09:01.700:  hear worrying stories about abuse of elderly residents at one home just outside Nairobi. The
09:01.700 - 09:10.000:  Sogato care home for the aged. Local media filmed here in 2020. I had no granny so close to me
09:10.340 - 09:17.060:  because my dad was a little funny. This is the manager Jane Gatoru presenting an image of a safe
09:22.380 - 09:28.340:  haven. This facility which is home to around 50 residents was set up by the women's guild of
09:28.340 - 09:33.520:  the local branch of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa but is managed independently.
09:34.940 - 09:42.340:  During our investigation staff admit to abuse at the home. We beat him and that's what comes
09:42.860 - 09:49.020:  down. And our undercover footage shows one resident being hit with a stick after she's found
09:49.020 - 09:56.320:  wandering outside the home's perimeter fence. Hit her on the Botox. Our reporters found more
09:56.320 - 10:03.420:  evidence of neglect. Here another man suffering from hand tremors explains that no one is helping
10:03.420 - 10:12.040:  him to eat. If I don't get some help I will sleep hungry. What can I do? One staff member alleges
10:12.040 - 10:19.640:  that this lack of support has had deadly consequences. Many have died of hunger here. They deny them
10:19.640 - 10:25.040:  lunch and dinner or because they don't make time to come and feed them. We also found evidence
10:25.040 - 10:32.060:  of medical conditions being left untreated. In secretly filmed footage an elderly man who we are
10:32.060 - 10:38.460:  calling Mwangi is showing our undercover journalist parts of his body affected by a serious skin
10:47.440 - 10:53.360:  condition. Despite his pain Mwangi says he is not getting the care he needs and after two weeks
10:53.360 - 11:00.640:  without treatment he tells our reporter that he is still in pain. It is so painful especially when
11:00.640 - 11:07.940:  I bend like this. You really need to go to hospital. When he talked to Jane about it what does she say?
11:09.340 - 11:14.260:  She keeps promising that there are people coming but they never come.
11:15.200 - 11:20.860:  We put the allegations to the manager of the home, Jane Gatturu. She told us the home always
11:20.860 - 11:26.420:  observes the rule of law and does not condone any form of brutality towards its residents.
11:27.160 - 11:33.180:  Those who struggle to eat are given priority assistance and any allegations that medical attention
11:33.180 - 11:40.020:  is not provided are lies and malice. We also showed some of our secret filming to Joseph
11:40.020 - 11:45.200:  Motari. The Kenya government's principal secretary responsible for social protection.
11:45.860 - 11:52.780:  Are you aware of homes that abuse elderly people? We are going to do spot checks on various
11:53.480 - 11:59.380:  private homes and see as to whether they meet the standards that they should be having.
12:01.000 - 12:05.680:  Over a month after we first spoke to him, Mwangi, the man with the skin condition,
12:05.680 - 12:13.100:  did get treated in hospital with help from his family. Some of the stories we had were shocking
12:13.820 - 12:19.240:  and whilst good care facilities do exist in Kenya are there many other elderly people
12:19.240 - 12:23.360:  suffering silently in homes where there is neither care nor love.
12:24.000 - 12:30.080:  And you can find the film betrayed elderly care exposed on the BBC Africa YouTube channel.
12:30.880 - 12:36.260:  The former US President Donald Trump is making his feelings clear about officials involved in his
12:36.260 - 12:42.640:  case concerning election fraud. On his social media platform Truth Social, Donald Trump says he'll
12:42.640 - 12:48.740:  be petitioning the judge to step aside alleging he won't get a fair trial if she presides in the case.
12:49.000 - 12:54.200:  He also attacked the lead prosecutor and the Department of Justice which he described as highly
12:54.200 - 13:00.700:  partisan and very corrupt. On Saturday prosecutors in Washington asked a judge to issue an order which
13:00.700 - 13:06.720:  would limit what Mr Trump can publicly discuss about his election fraud case, including on his
13:06.720 - 13:11.580:  own social media platform. Moe details from North America correspondent Shondali.
13:11.980 - 13:15.800:  I mean it's quite extraordinary. We paraphrase slightly when we say he said he'll be petitioning
13:15.800 - 13:20.120:  because that sounds far more respectful than the actual social media posts. He's put out he says
13:20.120 - 13:26.180:  that there's no way he can get a fair trial unless this judge recuses herself. Now he says that
13:26.180 - 13:31.500:  they'll be arguing this on what he describes as powerful grounds. The problem is for any
13:31.500 - 13:37.720:  defendant is that broadly judges and courts likely arguments to be made in the court of law,
13:37.720 - 13:42.460:  not the court of public opinion. But in reality Donald Trump is very much playing in
13:42.460 - 13:48.060:  that arena because again a point that his own lawyers have made here is part of the issue and
13:48.060 - 13:51.800:  you have to concede there as a point in this. The part of the issue of the timing is that it's
13:51.800 - 13:56.400:  in the middle of political season while he's campaigning to run for president of the United States.
13:56.680 - 14:00.900:  It's a very nuanced thing. It's certainly not likely to go down too well with Judge Tritkin.
14:01.360 - 14:06.980:  Shondali. Staying in the United States, the actress strike is entering its fourth week and some
14:06.980 - 14:11.660:  of the biggest film stars including George Clooney and Merrill Streep have donated one million
14:11.660 - 14:17.100:  dollars each to support their out-of-work colleagues. It's a reminder that while many of the performers
14:17.100 - 14:22.080:  in Hollywood are rich and famous, the majority of SAG, the screen actor's guild members,
14:22.080 - 14:28.100:  are modest wages for small supporting or walk-on rules. Tombrook reports from New York.
14:31.820 - 14:36.660:  Among those striking actors on picket lines in New York in recent days was 29-year-old Melissa
14:36.660 - 14:41.720:  Raquero. She's been a working actor for the past six years. She's had jobs in commercials,
14:41.720 - 14:48.700:  television and film. She's one of America's 160,000 unionized actors currently on strike.
14:48.700 - 14:54.060:  The issue vets in her the most is how her real income has declined because of streaming.
14:54.360 - 14:58.700:  A few years ago, I had one line on an episode of FBI that runs on CBS.
14:59.820 - 15:03.400:  Ma'am, you requested the personnel file on Dan Osborne. Every time that would air,
15:03.400 - 15:09.260:  I would get a check. You could make a decent living. I think I made $10,000 off one line,
15:09.260 - 15:14.900:  which is not bad. The same exact episode on Netflix. In fact, I was in two episodes of a show
15:14.900 - 15:23.240:  on Netflix. I probably made $700 in residuals. Instead of working, Melissa nowadays has a new routine,
15:23.240 - 15:28.540:  leaving her home and walking to her local subway station. This week, she traveled downtown to
15:28.540 - 15:37.120:  join a picket line outside Netflix offices in New York. A big concern of Melissa's striking
15:37.120 - 15:42.860:  colleagues is the use of AI, artificial intelligence in movie making. Background actors are a great
15:42.860 - 15:46.960:  example of this. What they want to do is they want to pay background actors a day rate, which is
15:46.960 - 15:52.700:  $180, scan them and then use their likeness in perpetuity for the rest of time. We can't let that
15:52.700 - 15:57.320:  happen. But the alliance of motion picture and television producers, which is negotiating on
15:57.320 - 16:02.700:  behalf of the major studios and streaming companies, says this claim is incorrect, stating
16:02.700 - 16:07.880:  their AI proposal would only permit digital replicas of a background actor in the film The
16:07.880 - 16:14.420:  Actor is Making, not for eternity. Overall, the studios have not endeared themselves to the strikers,
16:14.860 - 16:19.500:  particularly early on when Bob Iger, chief executive officer of Disney, appeared on the
16:19.500 - 16:24.940:  business news channel CNBC taking a firm view on the actor's demands. There's a level of
16:24.940 - 16:30.700:  expectation that they have that is just not realistic and they are adding to a set of challenges
16:30.700 - 16:36.500:  that this business is already facing. It has been a great business for all of these people.
16:37.080 - 16:41.620:  Many of the stars who have appeared at Union events are not short of money. Their presence,
16:41.680 - 16:47.500:  while welcomed, can confuse the message that the vast majority of strikers are not economically
16:47.500 - 16:54.240:  privileged. Melissa Raquero again. 90% of us out here are not out here making millions of dollars a
16:54.240 - 16:58.460:  year. We're just out here trying to pay our rent and make our health insurance and all we want to do
16:58.460 - 17:03.540:  is be paid fairly. The strike is just one aspect of a growing crisis in Philippine Hollywood,
17:03.860 - 17:08.080:  film critic Stephen Garrett. The problem with the streaming sites is that there's so much content
17:08.080 - 17:12.420:  on there now, which means there are tons of television shows that nobody's watched. And that's
17:12.420 - 17:16.420:  a conundrum too because I think the studios can really wait this out a lot longer than the actors
17:16.420 - 17:20.920:  in the writers might think. The dispute is also taking place at a time when traditional television
17:20.920 - 17:26.240:  long-established revenue source for Hollywood is declining with fewer homes paying for cable
17:26.240 - 17:31.560:  or satellite TV. This on top of the reduced box office and similar admissions means there's
17:31.560 - 17:36.420:  great uncertainty of a revenue stream in the industry reducing the willingness of the studios to
17:36.420 - 17:41.940:  accommodate to the demands of the strikers and making the dispute that much harder to resolve.
17:53.900 - 17:58.500:  Over the moon the mother and daughter who won a competition to travel into space.
18:06.820 - 18:12.000:  Pope Francis has held an open air mass in front of large crowds in Portugal at the end of a
18:12.000 - 18:16.760:  week-long international festival for young Catholics. The ceremony took place in the capital
18:16.760 - 18:21.380:  of Lisbon where the Pope also led a vigil with more than one million pilgrims.
18:21.900 - 18:25.040:  Alison Roberts was at the mass on Sunday and centers this report.
18:31.580 - 18:36.700:  Celebrating mass with over one million people this morning, the Pope highlighted the suffering
18:36.700 - 18:42.000:  of the people of Ukraine in calling for peace in the world. But in his send-off to the vast crowds
18:42.000 - 18:47.480:  of young pilgrims he offered above all messages with a personal focus such as that they must not
18:47.480 - 18:53.240:  be afraid to act, to question and to engage with the world away from social media. Throughout
18:53.240 - 18:58.760:  his stay in Lisbon he hailed the spirit and restlessness of young people, casting them as a means
18:58.760 - 19:03.980:  of bringing about change in a church that he has said needs it badly. One of the phrases he used
19:03.980 - 19:10.660:  most often here was that the church is open to all without exception. Alison Roberts. Sunday was
19:10.660 - 19:15.520:  another day of upset at the football women's world cup. The defending champions, the USA,
19:15.520 - 19:22.320:  were knocked out defeated by Sweden 5-4 on penalties. Shamakliel was watching the game in Melbourne.
19:22.900 - 19:28.360:  The reigning champions who are going for a record third world cup are now out of the world cup.
19:28.420 - 19:33.460:  This is a team that has dominated the game internationally for years. It has produced legends
19:33.460 - 19:39.760:  some of whom were playing today on the pitch. Today they were their fears themselves. They played
19:39.760 - 19:45.380:  aggressively. They pressed but they just could not score goals. Sweden's defense and their goalkeeper
19:45.380 - 19:50.800:  who hands down was the woman of the match just would not allow them to score. Then it came down
19:50.800 - 19:58.000:  to penalties and what a penalty shootout that was. Sweden won by the narrowest of margins in the
19:58.000 - 20:04.560:  end. Megan Rapinoe who says goodbye to world football missed a penalty and what a note to go out on
20:04.560 - 20:09.820:  definitely hurts. There are going to be many many questions about their performance in this
20:09.880 - 20:14.640:  tournament about why they didn't gel. This tournament has been described as the world cup of surprises
20:14.640 - 20:21.140:  of firsts of unpredictability and I think for the US fans this has ended with the worst of surprises
20:21.140 - 20:28.020:  for them. And here is the star US player Megan Rapinoe. You know I felt like we controlled the game
20:28.020 - 20:31.400:  but that doesn't win games and for the end of the day you go for the ball in the back of the net.
20:31.720 - 20:35.700:  Yeah it's a tough one and there's just a dark dark comedy and me missing.
20:36.420 - 20:42.520:  That'll be my last game ever. Megan Rapinoe. In the other game the Netherlands went through to the
20:42.520 - 20:48.960:  last eight after beating South Africa 2-0. On Tuesday the reggae girls from Jamaica will take on
20:48.960 - 20:54.100:  Colombia after drawing their last match with Brazil to get through to the second round for the
20:54.100 - 21:00.060:  first time ever in the competition. Sam have hailed it as the proudest moment in Jamaica's football
21:00.060 - 21:05.860:  history. Olivia Grange is Jamaica's Minister of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport.
21:06.520 - 21:13.820:  There are those who share a tear because it's a dream come true. It's a goal that was set by the
21:13.820 - 21:21.380:  girls that Jamaica share that dream and for a little country like ours with less than 3 million
21:21.380 - 21:28.620:  population and you can barely see us on the map and see that we were able to hold France to
21:28.660 - 21:39.200:  draw and also Brazil and we did Panama. It for me and for the people of Jamaica we just feel
21:39.200 - 21:45.980:  like we've done an awesome job. Olivia Grange, well Sadella Marley is an ambassador for the reggae girls
21:45.980 - 21:51.660:  and the daughter of the Jamaican music legend Bob Marley as well as the mother of reggae singer
21:51.660 - 21:57.720:  Skip Marley. Back in 2014 after learning the team had disbanded because they weren't receiving
21:57.720 - 22:03.460:  funding from Jamaica's football federation, Sadella became a benefactor and was instrumental in
22:03.460 - 22:10.520:  ensuring they could take part in the last World Cup in 2019. Paul Henley asked her how it felt to
22:10.520 - 22:16.300:  see the team plays so well at the competition in Australia and New Zealand. It feels good. I think
22:16.300 - 22:23.700:  the girls put in the work that was needed. They were very focused. I would like to say they're
22:23.700 - 22:30.020:  always in warrior mode and despite everything else that's been going on behind the scenes they knew
22:30.020 - 22:35.520:  what they had to do and they went out there and they did it. There was a time wasn't there when the
22:35.520 - 22:41.980:  football federation in Jamaica refused to fund the women's team. Yeah it was disbanded I think in
22:44.280 - 22:51.080:  2008 but in 2014 my son brought home a flyer and that's how I was aware that Jamaica actually had
22:51.080 - 22:56.940:  a woman's program. I make some calls to the federation in Jamaica and by the time you know I turned
22:56.940 - 23:03.220:  around you know I was being asked by Captain Burrell to be the global ambassador and I still am.
23:03.640 - 23:08.120:  And how important do you think your father Bob Marley's passion for football was for you?
23:08.460 - 23:14.780:  That is something that was instilled in us from a long time. It's like you wake up, you eat breakfast,
23:14.780 - 23:20.060:  you go to school, after school you play football, you do your homework, you go to bed but that was
23:20.060 - 23:25.560:  for my brothers you know my job was just to watch it happen. I think when that is said football is
23:25.560 - 23:32.520:  freedom that's saying to me now means so much more just because I've seen not only my country but
23:32.520 - 23:39.220:  other countries struggle for resources to get to this world platform and so football is freedom is
23:39.500 - 23:43.360:  is a real thing I were seeing it happen with the type of teams that are going through in this
23:43.360 - 23:49.940:  world cup. There are a lot of upsetters in this world cup and I'm really just watching it
23:49.940 - 23:56.160:  with different eyes. Will it be huge in Jamaica from now on in the sport? Football has always been
23:56.160 - 24:02.100:  the biggest sport in Jamaica just not the woman's side of it but now the woman have put Jamaica on
24:02.100 - 24:08.880:  the map so hopefully we will see local support increase but if not world support has increased
24:08.880 - 24:16.260:  and that we are grateful for. Sadella Marley it is six months since a huge earthquake hit Turkey
24:16.260 - 24:22.340:  in Syria killing more than 50,000 people and leaving many more homeless but despite the tragedy
24:22.340 - 24:27.880:  there are stories of hope such as baby Afra who was born beneath the rubble of her collapsed home
24:28.140 - 24:34.080:  the BBC's Hanan Razek caught up with Afra and her extended family to find out how they are all
24:34.080 - 24:43.760:  coping six months on. It was a moment that went viral around the world shaky phone footage of a man
24:43.760 - 24:49.600:  running from the rubble of a collapsed building clutching a tiny newborn baby a sign of hope
24:50.040 - 24:55.960:  amongst the devastation caused by the earthquake that hit Syria and Turkey in February this year.
24:58.140 - 25:03.180:  Baby Afra was born beneath the wreckage of her family's home in the Syrian town of Jinteris.
25:03.860 - 25:09.540:  Her mother died shortly after giving birth the building collapse also killed her father and her
25:09.540 - 25:20.040:  four siblings. But now Afra has a new life adopted by Khalil Asawati, her uncle and the man who pulled
25:20.040 - 25:25.800:  her from the rubble. I started to dig with my hands in the rubble then I could hear a voice so I
25:25.800 - 25:31.260:  carried on and sang good Afra came up in my hands she was still attached to her mother by her
25:31.260 - 25:37.360:  and billical cord when I found her. After the video of Afra's rescue went viral the attention was
25:37.360 - 25:43.880:  intense and offers to adopt her flooded in from around the world. Khalil says the family struggled
25:43.880 - 25:50.820:  to convince authorities to let them look after her. With the help from the police we managed to
25:50.820 - 25:59.580:  get extra security to protect her. The doctors at the hospital didn't seem to believe that I was her
25:59.580 - 26:05.520:  relative. I felt that he didn't want to give her to me. After a DNA test proved Afra is
26:05.520 - 26:11.540:  related to Khalil's wife they were able to live with her. Since then the family has turned down
26:11.540 - 26:17.160:  offers to live abroad in the UK and the United Arab Emirates. Khalil's home was destroyed in the
26:17.160 - 26:22.960:  earthquake so for two months following the disaster he lived along with Afra his wife and their
26:22.960 - 26:28.020:  seven children in a tent at a camp sit-up for people made homeless by the earthquake.
26:31.100 - 26:36.160:  Thanks to help from wheelwishers they have now been able to rent a house but the family says it's
26:36.160 - 26:41.660:  very expensive and they don't know how much longer they will be able to afford to stay. The road ahead
26:41.660 - 26:48.340:  might be difficult but Khalil says the family are grateful for the chance for a new start following
26:48.340 - 26:56.620:  the disaster. I lost everything. It was like going back to square one. I can't even afford to send in
26:56.620 - 27:04.360:  my kids to school but there are people living in worse conditions and genderless. Khalil Aswedi
27:04.360 - 27:11.300:  ending that report by Hanan Razak. Anameyra is a set to make history this week along with her
27:11.300 - 27:18.000:  mum Kisha by becoming the first ever mother and daughter in space. The pair from Antigua won the
27:18.000 - 27:24.700:  tickets in a competition for a trip on Virgin's VSS Unity Spacecraft. Louise Huzzy takes up the story.
27:28.060 - 27:34.520:  It's a once in a lifetime adventure few of us will ever experience but for Kisha and Anna
27:36.300 - 27:42.520:  their dream is on the edge of becoming a reality. They're about to become the first ever mum and
27:42.520 - 27:50.240:  daughter in space. They'll be on board Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity Spacecraft. Kisha says she
27:50.240 - 27:58.380:  still can't quite believe it. To just have the experience to actually go to space and look at
27:58.380 - 28:05.980:  our amazing planet from that high and to just breathe that in and to just being that's energy
28:05.980 - 28:12.700:  it's just super amazing. Anna says the nerves are starting to kick in but she's excited.
28:13.440 - 28:18.960:  It brings out a lot of emotion in me because it's something that I've wanted for so long and it's
28:19.080 - 28:23.820:  happening. I know that we'll get to experience weightlessness and be able to see the planet from
28:23.820 - 28:29.480:  outer space. I have no words to describe how I feel about experiencing that. Originally from Antigua
28:29.480 - 28:35.620:  in the Caribbean Anna is currently studying physics at Aberdeen University and hopes to eventually
28:35.620 - 28:43.160:  work for NASA so Richard Branson delivered the good news himself. Hi Anna, you and your mother
28:43.160 - 28:49.940:  are going to space. Anna we want her mum won the seats on the rocket after entering a competition
28:49.940 - 28:57.020:  she saw advertised on a flight as they travelled to get Anna's student visa. Anna believes it was
28:57.020 - 29:03.900:  written in the stars. Had I not chosen Aberdeen University and had we not had to take a massive
29:03.900 - 29:12.160:  detour to get my visa we wouldn't be going to space. This is cool! Anna hopes her example will
29:12.160 - 29:18.660:  inspire aspiring astronauts like some of these young people at a recent UK Space Agency event
29:18.660 - 29:24.560:  in Aberdeen. I think that's really cool that people like from Aberdeen can go off into space it's
29:24.560 - 29:31.380:  really amazing. How does it make you feel seeing the rockets and everything? It's great,
29:32.680 - 29:39.140:  it's because I've seen the earth weather well. I can see my house from the earth. Anna and Kisha say
29:39.140 - 29:44.840:  their bond makes the voyage all the more special. You're going to be the first mother and daughter
29:44.840 - 29:52.340:  to ever go into space. How does that feel? It is so much more reassuring and so connecting
29:52.460 - 29:58.080:  to be able to do this than someone I love so much. The Virgin Space Flight takes off from
29:58.080 - 30:07.700:  New Mexico on Thursday. Louis Hosey and finally Barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the
30:07.700 - 30:13.440:  year and now it's record breaking. This weekend it will have made a billion dollars in ticket sales

30:19.860 - 30:26.600:  This report from Charlotte Galha. Hey Barbie, can I come to your house today? Sure,
30:27.500 - 30:30.760:  I don't have anything big planned just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies and
30:30.760 - 30:34.060:  Plank choreography and a bespoke song you should stop by. So cool.
30:34.380 - 30:41.500:  Barbies perfectly pink world, her dreamhouse and of course Ken have seen millions of us
30:41.500 - 30:47.460:  flocking to the cinema. The blonde beautiful doll that many spent their childhoods playing with
30:47.460 - 30:54.760:  has been brought to life by Margot Robbie with Ryan Gosling as Barbie's permatand on off boyfriend

31:43.900 - 31:49.440:  This was an event movie and I think we'll be seeing more of those things. You dress up for it,
31:49.500 - 31:56.620:  you bring your friends, you wear pink if it's a Barbie movie. That really caught on with audiences.
31:56.920 - 32:01.220:  Mattel, the makers of Barbie are hoping to repeat the success with other toys.
