00:13.220 - 00:17.100:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.300 - 00:23.940:  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 13 hours GMT on Friday 11 August, these are our main stories.
00:24.220 - 00:30.140:  China says it's uncovered a spy working for the U.S. intelligence agency, the CIA.
00:30.180 - 00:34.120:  We have a special report on the effect of the military coup in Niger.
00:34.780 - 00:40.940:  The world's sky-jamboree plagued with problems, including a heat wave, winds up with a pot concert.
00:43.700 - 00:52.680:  Also, this podcast takes a lot of mental power, physical power and emotional power to even make it to this world stage.
00:53.120 - 00:54.600:  You have to be the best.
00:55.000 - 00:59.720:  Pokémon's coming home to Japan as the world championships get underway.
01:03.620 - 01:06.780:  We begin the podcast with the tale of espionage.
01:06.780 - 01:11.980:  China says it's uncovered a spy recruited by the U.S. intelligence service, the CIA.
01:12.140 - 01:17.500:  The state security ministry said the Chinese national, known only by the surname Zung,
01:17.500 - 01:23.700:  was employed at a military organization and was taken on by the Americans during a work trip to Italy.
01:24.320 - 01:27.540:  Ariesia Pacific editor, Will Leonardo is with me in the studio.
01:28.020 - 01:30.780:  Tell us more about what China is saying about this agent.
01:31.440 - 01:33.640:  So yes, this is a statement from the Chinese security ministry.
01:33.640 - 01:39.880:  It says this man called Zung in his 50s, who worked for what's described as a military industrial group, was sent to Italy.
01:39.880 - 01:44.080:  And there he was alleged to have met a U.S. embassy official by the name of Seth.
01:44.660 - 01:46.300:  It appears they lived it up together initially.
01:46.300 - 01:49.460:  They went to the dinner parties, they went on outings, they went to the opera together.
01:49.960 - 01:55.540:  And there's some interesting wording in the statement that says that Zung became psychologically dependent and succumbed to Western values.
01:56.000 - 02:02.140:  Seth is then is then said to have offered Zung a large sum of money and immigration to the U.S. for himself and his family.
02:02.140 - 02:08.440:  And Zung signed an espionage agreement to provide sensitive material about Chinese military once back in China.
02:08.860 - 02:15.940:  Once back in the country, he met up with CIA agents to select multiple times to provide what's been described as a large amount of core intelligence.
02:15.940 - 02:17.360:  There's no word on what that is.
02:17.820 - 02:22.640:  The ministry said it was taking compulsory measures against Zung and would be handed to prosecution services soon.
02:23.180 - 02:27.180:  And there's been no independent confirmation and no word from the U.S. authorities.
02:27.180 - 02:29.500:  Although it's unlikely that they'll be speaking a lot on this topic.
02:29.840 - 02:34.780:  And what is the state of play between China and the U.S. when it comes to espionage?
02:35.260 - 02:42.000:  Well, there seems to be a rare detailed disclosure from China, even though Beijing has long claimed foreign forces are trying to undermine the country.
02:42.000 - 02:49.920:  It recently expanded its definition of espionage, made it slightly more vague to include things in the private sector, including U.S. firms and that sort of thing.
02:50.500 - 02:59.040:  And it comes, as you say, amid heightened tensions between the two great powers over trade over military, we've had those restrictions of chips to China by the U.S. authorities.
02:59.720 - 03:02.500:  And it's also the latest accusation of espionage from either side.
03:02.500 - 03:09.360:  So last week we had two U.S. Navy sailors arrested in California for allegedly providing material to Chinese authorities.
03:09.460 - 03:21.280:  And also, it comes a few months after the CIA director, Bill Burns, said the agency was trying to expand its Chinese network after a catastrophic exposure event in which several spies were lost.
03:21.940 - 03:23.480:  Thanks, Will. We'll Leonardo.
03:24.620 - 03:32.860:  The authorities and Hawaii's island of Marui say it will take many years and billions of dollars to repair the damage caused by devastating wildfires.
03:33.400 - 03:35.580:  55 people are now known to have died.
03:36.300 - 03:39.420:  T.Dang was visiting from Kansas City in the United States.
03:40.460 - 03:50.200:  Once our car started exploding here, we had at least 50 cars there, like a line up right behind us, and each car is just pop, pop, pop, pop.
03:50.500 - 03:55.200:  It started shooting debris to us. We had to move even more down. This time we're in the water.
03:55.560 - 04:00.240:  Water's hitting harder and harder. So it hit us, it kept pushing us back and forth.
04:00.400 - 04:06.160:  I got a big scrape from my bottom all the way down to my calves and the rocks is really harsh.
04:06.160 - 04:10.380:  The nurse told me that it was kind of like basically, I got scratched and burned at the same time.
04:11.280 - 04:12.540:  T.Dang in Marui.
04:13.560 - 04:18.520:  The military coup in Niger has caused huge concern, resulting in West African heads of state,
04:18.520 - 04:21.260:  meeting in Abuja to discuss the situation.
04:21.760 - 04:28.020:  The group, comprising the regional block ECOWAS, has agreed to assemble a standby force to intervene if necessary.
04:28.060 - 04:36.720:  International partners have cut aid to the country and some have imposed sanctions to try to convince the army leaders in Niger to step down.
04:37.100 - 04:43.940:  But the junta appears to have popular support because it's opposing the influence of France, Niger's former colonial ruler.
04:44.480 - 04:47.580:  Some people are even calling for closer ties with Russia instead.
04:48.200 - 04:54.460:  Our Africa correspondent, Catherine Biyarahanga, has this report on how the coup is affecting daily life in Niger.
04:59.480 - 05:05.320:  Zara Kadastair's a pot of food at her small outdoor restaurant in Niamay, the capital of Niger.
05:05.680 - 05:08.860:  A few customers seated on wooden benches way to be served.
05:13.600 - 05:19.140:  She and other ordinary people are beginning to feel the impact of the fallouts from Niger's coup.
05:19.600 - 05:24.520:  Sanctions have cut off imports causing the prices of popular staples to go up,
05:25.040 - 05:28.520:  and major cities are facing rolling electricity blackouts.
05:30.460 - 05:34.020:  The price of prices increase but also a lot of cooking oil.
05:34.280 - 05:37.280:  An increase of four US dollars in just one week.
05:37.600 - 05:41.060:  This causes us problems because if I prepare the rice, I can't sell it.
05:41.400 - 05:42.920:  No profit on the losses.
05:43.580 - 05:46.620:  Since the military took power, we no longer have electricity.
05:46.620 - 05:53.860:  When I tried to find out, I was told that it was Nigeria that cut the electricity to denounce the coup d'etat that had taken place in our country.
05:59.480 - 06:02.260:  Niger soldiers seized power two weeks ago.
06:02.620 - 06:08.240:  A series of rallies, including at the National Stadium,
06:08.240 - 06:14.200:  have been attended by thousands of people, suggesting widespread backing for the coup
06:14.560 - 06:17.200:  that's ousted the democratically elected government.
06:17.800 - 06:19.860:  Isofa Umaru is one of the supporters.
06:19.860 - 06:22.820:  We like our army. Now we are free now.
06:23.140 - 06:25.900:  We don't need the France. We don't need anything.
06:26.260 - 06:29.200:  We like Russia. We like our country.
06:32.460 - 06:37.020:  The militia takeover has unleashed already present anti-French sentiments
06:37.620 - 06:41.520:  that have seen protesters stream the streets in support of the coup.
06:42.080 - 06:46.060:  They have held stones and set parts of the French embassy on fire.
06:47.920 - 06:50.560:  Some protesters carried Russian flags,
06:51.220 - 06:55.520:  calling on Moscow to step in as their preferred international ally.
06:58.840 - 07:03.820:  Russian propaganda networks promoted as a fairer partner for African countries.
07:04.180 - 07:07.440:  It has built close relationships with Niger's neighbors,
07:07.800 - 07:11.900:  Mali and Burkina Faso, which are also led by military regimes.
07:16.560 - 07:19.420:  Ibrahim Suleiman, who is a tailor in the army,
07:19.940 - 07:23.720:  says Russian flags have been on demand since the military took over.
07:26.220 - 07:30.260:  It was with advent of the Tienic coup that they started seeing flags,
07:31.180 - 07:35.600:  especially for Russia. People come to buy a lot of them because they use them
07:36.080 - 07:38.020:  to support our soldiers of taking power.
07:38.660 - 07:41.040:  People buy them because we are in conflict with France.
07:41.440 - 07:47.100:  For years, France has only caused us problems and the military wants to put an end to it.
07:47.500 - 07:53.040:  There's a worry France and Western countries are losing influence to Russia in this region.
07:53.780 - 07:58.280:  But there are other Nigerians who support the deposed president, Mohammed Bazoum.
07:58.840 - 08:03.600:  African countries and international allies have called for him to be released for military
08:03.600 - 08:09.920:  detention and to be reinstated. Ibrahim Mahazaki says the coup is not justified.
08:12.420 - 08:15.620:  I condemn this coup because currently we have no problem in the country.
08:16.180 - 08:19.920:  Not only are services working well, insecurity has decreased a lot.
08:20.760 - 08:24.840:  There aren't labor strikes like before and financially, there is no crisis.
08:24.840 - 08:26.880:  So we have no worries in the country, frankly.
08:27.740 - 08:31.600:  Someone can't just come up and stage a coup for their own personal interests.
08:31.960 - 08:38.100:  France Nichea's former colonial ruler has some 1,500 troops stationed in the country.
08:38.760 - 08:45.340:  It sees Nichea as a close ally in the fight against a growing Islamist insurgency in this part
08:45.340 - 08:52.420:  of Africa. But the former colonial power is accused of unfairly benefiting from Nichea's
08:52.420 - 08:58.340:  natural resources and wielding and due influence over the country's economy and politics.
08:59.160 - 09:04.440:  Similar anti-fraint sentiments are widespread across its former colonies on the continent.
09:05.180 - 09:10.660:  Six countries from Guinea in West Africa to Sudan in the Horn of Africa have experienced
09:10.660 - 09:15.320:  coups since 2020. Five of them are former French colonies.
09:15.320 - 09:19.480:  Maria Rocher-Billois is a West Africa political analyst.
09:19.920 - 09:26.680:  Unlike other colonial masters who manage to take more distance with their colonies after independence,
09:26.680 - 09:32.400:  France has had a very hard time accepting to losing grip on those countries.
09:33.020 - 09:40.800:  So very conveniently, the poochist and the elite in the Sahel traditionally tend to
09:41.340 - 09:45.900:  scapegoat the French for their own failures like corruption or mismanagement.
09:46.200 - 09:51.160:  And France has now its own scapegoat, which is Rocher and the Wadden militia.
09:51.340 - 09:54.360:  It used to stir the anti-French resentment.
09:54.940 - 09:58.960:  The worry is that should another coup in Africa succeed.
09:59.600 - 10:02.160:  It will encourage other ambitious soldiers.
10:03.060 - 10:04.280:  Catherine Biara-Hanga.
10:05.000 - 10:09.680:  South Africa's former president, Jacob Zuma, was supposed to be serving an 11-month jail sentence
10:09.680 - 10:13.600:  for contempt of court. He reported to his local prison, but in an hour later,
10:13.600 - 10:15.000:  the authorities released him.
10:15.480 - 10:19.820:  Our correspondent in South Africa, Nomsomaseko, has more on what led to that decision.
10:20.480 - 10:30.040:  The former president came in at his old lock and he left an after seven or eight lock and he left after...
10:30.040 - 10:35.160:  The Commissioner of Prisons, Mahoti Tawakhale, held a press conference earlier today,
10:35.160 - 10:41.580:  which he said that the former president was released under a special remission process,
10:41.580 - 10:45.140:  which means now that he is under correctional supervision.
10:45.140 - 10:54.560:  And he is one of 9,400 other prisoners who were sentenced for non-violent or low-risk crimes.
10:55.320 - 10:59.940:  And the government is saying that the reason why they have done this is to try and tackle
10:59.940 - 11:02.380:  overcrowding in South African prisons.
11:02.940 - 11:08.000:  So we do also know that the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is the one who actually
11:08.000 - 11:12.720:  signed into law that low-risk prisoners should be released.
11:12.720 - 11:19.360:  And he did this back in April, but today is actually the first day that the first group
11:19.360 - 11:22.620:  of the more than 9,000 offenders are actually being released.
11:23.520 - 11:27.340:  Now, Jacob Zuma, the former president, has been in and out of jail. Hasn't he
11:27.340 - 11:32.000:  tell us about his case and why this is all so controversial in South Africa?
11:33.080 - 11:38.500:  Well, this is very controversial in South Africa because Jacob Zuma was sentenced to 15 months
11:38.500 - 11:45.360:  in jail for refusing to testify at a judicial commission of inquiry that was investigating government
11:45.360 - 11:51.080:  corruption during his nine-year term in office. And that is why he got that prison sentence.
11:51.080 - 11:59.580:  However, back in 2021, on the day that he was taken into custody, there were riots that were
11:59.580 - 12:05.280:  sparked, very violent riots. In fact, one of the worst that South Africa has seen in a democratic
12:05.280 - 12:13.020:  dispensation in which more than 350 people died and hundreds of businesses were looted and burned.
12:13.800 - 12:16.860:  Nomsat Maseko. And now to South Korea.
12:26.400 - 12:31.560:  Where the world's skirt jamboree has closed with a pop concert at the World Cup Stadium in Seoul.
12:32.040 - 12:37.180:  The jamboree was plagued with problems, including bug-infested fields, dirty lavatories,
12:37.560 - 12:42.080:  and a heatwave before a looming typhoon forced everyone to leave the campsite.
12:42.600 - 12:49.700:  More than 40,000 people from 155 countries, many of them teenagers, aged between 14 to 17 years old,
12:49.700 - 12:54.160:  were at the event, the first global gathering of scouts since the pandemic.
12:54.800 - 12:58.640:  Speaking at the closing ceremony, the Secretary-General of the World Organization of the
12:58.680 - 13:02.400:  Skat Movement, Ahmad Alandawi acknowledged the difficulties.
13:03.360 - 13:05.800:  I know this wasn't easy on you.
13:07.060 - 13:13.000:  No other event has faced this many challenges and extreme weather conditions.
13:14.220 - 13:22.280:  But also, no other jamboree in history showed the determination, creativity, and the resilience
13:22.880 - 13:23.600:  you have shown.
13:24.680 - 13:27.260:  Our correspondent in South Korea is Jean McKenzie.
13:27.900 - 13:30.680:  The pop concert started at 7 o'clock this evening.
13:31.100 - 13:33.160:  That came after a bit of a closing ceremony.
13:33.160 - 13:38.460:  So this is it, the jamboree officially drawing to an end, which I think, honestly,
13:39.640 - 13:43.780:  organizers and scout leaders will be breathing a slight sigh of relief over,
13:43.780 - 13:47.280:  because as you say, it's been absolutely played by problems from the start.
13:47.700 - 13:48.920:  They are going out with the bang though.
13:48.920 - 13:53.640:  The South Koreans, organizers have pulled out all the stops with this K-pop concert this evening,
13:53.640 - 13:58.580:  hoping I think that the tens of thousands of teenagers who gathered here from around the world
13:59.060 - 14:00.660:  were at least end with happy memories.
14:00.660 - 14:05.880:  So they're seeing some of South Korea's most famous K-pop groups, including new genes.
14:06.380 - 14:10.340:  But some of those problems that you mentioned there, I mean, the head of the world scout organization
14:10.340 - 14:16.600:  described this event to me earlier this week as the unlucky as jamboree in their 100-year history.
14:17.060 - 14:20.360:  Because as you say, it's had a heat wave earlier in the week we had some flooding.
14:20.360 - 14:25.180:  And then, of course, the whole thing had to be evacuated because of this incoming typhoon.
14:25.480 - 14:29.520:  And the UK scouts, along with others like the US and the Singaporean teams,
14:29.780 - 14:33.400:  actually pulled out even earlier than that because they were so concerned about hygiene
14:33.400 - 14:34.580:  and safety on the sides.
14:38.480 - 14:39.800:  Still to come in this podcast,
14:40.500 - 14:44.140:  boys shouldn't only be able to play football girls who also get to play football.
14:44.140 - 14:48.020:  My team is really good. Who says girls can't play football?
14:48.600 - 14:52.060:  The growing popularity of women's football across Asia.
14:59.460 - 15:03.680:  Spain and Sweden are through to next week semi-finals in the women's world cup
15:03.680 - 15:07.300:  having beaten the Netherlands and Japan respectively earlier today.
15:07.820 - 15:12.320:  Despite losing at the quarter final stage this year, women's football in Japan is thriving
15:12.320 - 15:14.920:  and doing better than their male counterparts.
15:15.600 - 15:18.240:  It's a situation replicated across Asia.
15:18.940 - 15:22.180:  Nick Marsh watched the next generation of young female players
15:22.520 - 15:25.700:  at the Singapore Football Club to try to find out why.
15:30.140 - 15:33.380:  Asia loves football. World Cup, Premier League,
15:33.680 - 15:35.700:  you name it, people here, love it.
15:36.340 - 15:41.220:  But the football teams in this part of the world, the men's football teams in this part of the
15:41.220 - 15:45.800:  world, rather, are not so successful and that's putting it mildly.
15:46.120 - 15:51.100:  The last time a country from Southeast Asia qualified for the World Cup was in
15:51.100 - 15:53.460:  Indonesia nearly a hundred years ago.
15:53.460 - 15:56.660:  In fact, the idea of the likes of Vietnam or the Philippines,
15:56.660 - 16:00.280:  even China qualifying for the men's tournament,
16:00.820 - 16:02.340:  well that's pretty far fetched.
16:02.340 - 16:05.220:  And yet here they are representing themselves
16:05.220 - 16:09.260:  admirably at this year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
16:11.480 - 16:12.060:  So why is this?
16:15.820 - 16:20.180:  Football across the board is actually pretty inclusive in this part of the world.
16:20.180 - 16:24.180:  It's common to find young female fans at stadiums.
16:24.620 - 16:29.840:  In Japan's Jay League, for example, 40% of those at men's games are women.
16:33.400 - 16:39.440:  And it's this enthusiasm that's got elite clubs and sponsors investing in training,
16:40.580 - 16:42.840:  education and talent spotting in Asia.
16:43.560 - 16:48.520:  For us to see that women's teams in Asia are getting onto the main stage to the world's
16:48.660 - 16:49.340:  biggest tournament.
16:49.780 - 16:52.240:  It's a credit to the countries to the investment into football.
16:53.380 - 16:57.020:  Shannon Maloney is an ex-player who now works for Tottenham Hotspur
16:57.400 - 16:59.320:  as their global development coach.
16:59.780 - 17:04.320:  Backed by Tottenham's main sponsor, she runs football camps in places like Vietnam,
17:04.320 - 17:07.120:  Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore.
17:07.900 - 17:11.400:  I feel like being a role model to young girls and they see me they can be me.
17:11.540 - 17:14.280:  We're seeing so many young girls getting involved in football.
17:14.660 - 17:17.220:  And for us it's about how do we embed that into the community?
17:17.220 - 17:18.540:  How do we make that normal?
17:22.600 - 17:27.580:  And Singapore football club striker, 11 year old Lulu Lane certainly agrees.
17:27.920 - 17:31.640:  Boy shouldn't only be able to play football girls should also get to play football.
17:31.640 - 17:33.580:  My team is really good.
17:34.100 - 17:35.420:  Who says girls can't play football?
17:38.580 - 17:39.080:  Good point.
17:39.080 - 17:44.660:  And in other football news, Argentina has announced measures to punish foreign football fans
17:44.660 - 17:48.780:  who burn or tear banknotes as a way of taunting local supporters.
17:49.340 - 17:52.320:  They'll now face prison sentences of up to 30 days.
17:52.880 - 17:55.520:  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Rocha reports.
17:56.260 - 18:00.960:  The burning and ripping up of money has become common among fans who travel to Argentina
18:00.960 - 18:04.360:  to watch their clubs in South American club competitions,
18:05.100 - 18:07.080:  particularly Brazilians and Chileans.
18:07.420 - 18:10.640:  They tease their rivals about Argentina's economic crisis
18:11.020 - 18:13.740:  and the low value of the local currency, the peso.
18:14.240 - 18:17.580:  Argentina has one of the world's highest annual inflation rates
18:17.960 - 18:20.020:  is currently more than 100%.
18:20.400 - 18:24.320:  The local football authorities said such behavior was highly offensive
18:24.760 - 18:26.000:  and cutting-side violence.
18:26.000 - 18:31.860:  Fans will be detained and the clubs they support may also be punished if the problem persists.
18:32.400 - 18:33.360:  Leonardo Rocha
18:34.260 - 18:37.120:  The list of weather-related crises is growing every day,
18:37.240 - 18:39.160:  including the wildfires in Hawaii,
18:39.620 - 18:41.400:  initially Greece and Portugal,
18:41.400 - 18:46.680:  the floods in China and record levels of melting of the Antarctic ice sheet.
18:47.260 - 18:51.860:  Scientists and I are assessing if there's a common thread linking these events across the world.
18:52.300 - 18:56.500:  Professor Catherine Heo is chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy,
18:56.500 - 18:59.420:  a global environmental non-profit charity.
19:00.060 - 19:02.460:  Within our lifetime, actually right even now,
19:02.460 - 19:05.660:  we are already starting to see individual days
19:05.660 - 19:09.080:  where it is really too hot for humans to be outside.
19:09.080 - 19:11.420:  I'm speaking to you from Texas right now,
19:11.420 - 19:18.020:  where almost 400 high temperature records have been broken across the state of Texas this summer alone.
19:18.020 - 19:21.080:  It has been over 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
19:21.080 - 19:24.060:  which is a nice round number, but you know 38 degrees Celsius.
19:24.580 - 19:28.760:  It's been over that for almost every single day since the end of June.
19:28.760 - 19:33.700:  And it is just really, really difficult and unpleasant to spend time outdoors in that weather.
19:34.260 - 19:37.720:  Well, that's the bad news and we've heard again about what needs to be done
19:37.720 - 19:40.340:  to combat the threat on a global level.
19:40.920 - 19:45.380:  But Professor Heo also has ideas about how we can cope in our urban environments.
19:46.280 - 19:51.360:  There are already early warning heat systems in a number of major cities,
19:51.360 - 19:56.640:  and they have been shown to significantly reduce the health risks,
19:56.900 - 19:59.260:  and even in the deaths associated with these heatwaves,
19:59.340 - 20:04.400:  there are also ways to reduce the urban heat island effect.
20:05.000 - 20:09.140:  So many large cities are quite a bit warmer than their surrounding areas.
20:09.840 - 20:14.700:  So if we can increase the green content of the city,
20:15.160 - 20:20.160:  trees, grasses, it increases evaporation, which cools the city down,
20:20.160 - 20:22.560:  if we can increase the reflectivity of the city,
20:22.560 - 20:26.940:  instead of having black top and black roofs have light colored surfaces
20:26.940 - 20:30.260:  that reflect the sun's energy back to space instead of soaking it up,
20:30.640 - 20:33.560:  we can actually lower the temperature of our cities
20:34.020 - 20:35.600:  just as climate change is pushing it up.
20:36.460 - 20:40.660:  You still need to invest in communities to make sure there's, you know,
20:40.660 - 20:43.700:  buddy systems where people call people, especially elderly people,
20:43.700 - 20:45.880:  and check up on them and ask if they're okay.
20:46.480 - 20:48.440:  We need all of these resilient strategies,
20:48.460 - 20:51.940:  but we also have to reduce our emissions as much as possible,
20:51.940 - 20:52.800:  soon as possible.
20:53.060 - 20:56.640:  Professor Catherine Heihou Chief Scientist of the Nature Conservancy.
20:58.120 - 21:01.780:  And finally, the Pokémon World Championships are taking place in the southern
21:01.780 - 21:05.920:  city of Yokohama in Japan. It's the first time it's been held in the country
21:06.240 - 21:10.060:  where the game was invented. If you're not familiar with the phenomenon,
21:10.060 - 21:13.220:  Pokémon is a game involving little virtual creatures
21:13.640 - 21:16.380:  inhabiting a mythical universe shared with humans,
21:16.880 - 21:19.440:  and it first became popular about 20 years ago.
21:19.740 - 21:23.540:  YouTube streamed more than nine hours of coverage from the opening day.
21:24.100 - 21:26.700:  It's going to be the water main to move first with the dazzling gleam,
21:26.820 - 21:30.140:  and Urshifu is also there just to touch faster naturally,
21:30.140 - 21:33.080:  so the post-convented of the Golden Go just to be able to clean it up.
21:33.480 - 21:36.660:  And that is going to be the match going to Kentato, Matamoto!
21:37.440 - 21:40.780:  Well, James Coppnell spoke to content creator Glitch,
21:41.020 - 21:42.860:  who's attending the championship tournament.
21:43.620 - 21:49.100:  The atmosphere at the Pokémon World Championships here in Yokohama has been electrifying,
21:49.560 - 21:53.920:  and that's kind of understating it a bit because the energy that has been
21:53.920 - 21:58.760:  just spreading around, especially since the opening ceremony, such as been
21:59.460 - 22:04.680:  like incredible. This is my fifth World Championship, but first time in Japan,
22:04.680 - 22:11.940:  so this means a lot to me to actually be here, be back with the fans after a year apart,
22:11.940 - 22:14.740:  globally, and it's just been so exciting to be here.
22:14.960 - 22:18.440:  Yeah, I can hear it in your voice. So it feels like for many in Japan,
22:18.440 - 22:20.980:  a homecoming, does it? The Pokémon has come home?
22:21.240 - 22:23.580:  Oh, yes, definitely. That's what it feels like,
22:23.620 - 22:30.100:  and the opening ceremony this morning felt like a very welcoming type of welcome party,
22:30.100 - 22:34.620:  because they were very excited to share their culture with the world,
22:34.620 - 22:38.780:  and they share that through Pokémon, and I think that's just incredible.
22:39.440 - 22:44.160:  How does a championship work? Because high-level competition is often just that.
22:44.160 - 22:49.320:  Competition, it's aggressive sometimes. Is it like that in Pokémon, or is there more of a
22:49.360 - 22:53.920:  sharing spirit? It's a little bit of both, so when you think of Pokémon, you think about it
22:53.920 - 23:01.240:  with chess, but it's very, very colorful, fun, chess, and available to everybody of all ages,
23:01.900 - 23:08.220:  and just the way to get the championship, it takes a lot of mental power, physical power,
23:08.220 - 23:14.240:  and emotional power, to even make it to this world stage. You have to be the best, like,
23:14.420 - 23:19.360:  no one ever was, and the road to become a champion is a very tough,
23:19.360 - 23:25.600:  engrowing process for all ages, because it's not just adult cell play, it's also kids of all ages,
23:25.600 - 23:31.080:  as well. So you have different divisions, and you have different age divisions, excuse me,
23:31.080 - 23:36.140:  and they go through multiple challenges throughout the year just to get to this stage.
23:36.400 - 23:42.100:  What are you expecting them from the next few days? I'm expecting a lot of surprises, actually,
23:42.100 - 23:48.000:  because there are four titles being showcased here at Pokémon Worlds here in Yokohama,
23:48.280 - 23:54.140:  and I'm from North America, from the United States. I'm used to seeing the Pokémon that has
23:54.140 - 24:00.260:  been played there. We call this the meta, the Medigame, but it is different for each region that
24:00.260 - 24:05.860:  is competing at world. So it's going to be very interesting seeing North American teams go
24:05.860 - 24:11.100:  on against the A-Pag teams, or up against the European teams, because they all play differently.
24:11.660 - 24:15.700:  Yeah, and so it's going to be really interesting to see that come together and see how we match
24:15.700 - 24:19.820:  up against each other globally. Pokémon content creator, glitch.
24:22.420 - 24:27.260:  And that's it from us for now, but before we go, here's Jackie with news of the next happy pot.
24:27.940 - 24:32.420:  Yes, in this edition we'll be checking in on the baby girl, born beneath the rubble of her family
24:32.420 - 24:36.980:  home, who became a symbol of hope after the devastation of the earthquake that hit Syria
24:36.980 - 24:41.780:  and Turkey six months ago. We'll be meeting the teenager who has made it his mission in life to
24:41.780 - 24:47.140:  get us all to recycle batteries. The wonder of gazing back at Earth from the edge of space,
24:47.140 - 24:51.560:  we will hear from the mother and daughter from Antigua and the British man with Parkinson's
24:51.560 - 24:56.820:  who have just made that trip. Also, and I promise you all love this, the world dog surfing
24:56.820 - 25:01.040:  championships have just taken place in California, we will hear from one of the competitors,
25:01.840 - 25:06.660:  well his human friend. All in the happy God, available from Saturday, August 12th.
25:06.740 - 25:12.740:  And the dog too, I hope Jackie, if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,

25:41.740 - 25:45.880:  Whenever I open up my phone, they're just endless warnings of more extreme weather to come.
25:46.160 - 25:51.100:  I'm Hannah, I'm the presenter of a new podcast called What in the World from the BBC World Service.
