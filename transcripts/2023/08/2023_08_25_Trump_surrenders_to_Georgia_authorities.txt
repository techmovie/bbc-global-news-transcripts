00:20.480 - 00:26.520:  from its tsunami hit Fukushima nuclear power plant. But how did the 2011 disaster happen?
00:26.520 - 00:33.500:  And could it have been prevented? It's all underwater. Station blackout, reactor control systems
00:33.500 - 00:39.400:  have lost all power. Fukushima, a powerful podcast series from the BBC World Service,
00:39.400 - 00:44.880:  tells the story. Search for Fukushima wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:49.060 - 00:53.120:  There were very little representations when it came to people with disabilities.
00:53.120 - 00:58.540:  On the podium is the podcast with Olympians and Paralympians past and present telling their
00:58.540 - 01:04.540:  inspirational stories. It comes so far. The first person people think of when they think of
01:04.540 - 01:09.960:  strength could be a Paralympic. Listen now by searching for on the podium wherever you get your BBC
01:09.960 - 01:16.360:  podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:18.940 - 01:24.800:  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Friday the 25th of August these are our main stories.
01:25.340 - 01:30.640:  Donald Trump faces criminal charges in the state of Georgia for trying to overturn the US presidential
01:30.680 - 01:36.240:  election result. We'll have the latest from Atlanta. President Putin breaks his silence over
01:36.240 - 01:42.140:  the presumed death of the Wagner Bosch Evgeny Pregoshen. And most of these penguins will never
01:42.140 - 01:47.000:  have seen a human being in their life. But it's human-induced climate change which is driving
01:47.000 - 01:52.720:  their futures in the future which is looking really bleak. Scientists observe a catastrophic die-off
01:52.720 - 02:01.700:  of emperor penguins chicks in Antarctica. Also in this podcast Zimbabwe starts arresting election
02:01.700 - 02:08.300:  monitors after accusations the presidential poll was rigged. The electoral process is fundamentally
02:08.300 - 02:14.800:  flawed and is unable to produce a free and fair electoral outcome. And the head of Spain's
02:14.800 - 02:20.760:  football federation is expected to resign after kissing a player at the Women's World Cup final.
02:24.900 - 02:29.980:  We begin in the US state of Georgia where Donald Trump is charged with trying to overturn
02:29.980 - 02:36.180:  his 2020 election defeat in the state. He has until Friday to surrender himself to the authorities
02:36.180 - 02:41.460:  and to face 13 charges against him which include racketeering and full statements.
02:41.460 - 02:47.500:  The former president who denies any wrongdoing has left his home in New Jersey. Many of his 18
02:47.500 - 02:53.500:  co-defendants, including Rudy Giuliani, have already surrendered at the Fulton County Jail
02:53.740 - 02:57.940:  in Atlanta. These Trump supporters have been protesting outside the prison.
03:07.020 - 03:12.200:  I think this is a political persecution and now that it's turned into a political prosecution.
03:12.220 - 03:19.980:  I'm here to support President Trump. He's being ridiculously indicted week after week. Basically,
03:19.980 - 03:23.800:  they want to throw their political opponent in jail. That's third world stuff.
03:24.280 - 03:29.560:  Chris Timmons is a former prosecutor in Georgia and he knows the Fulton County Jail well.
03:29.560 - 03:35.020:  So, what's it like? It's not a nice place. It's scary. Atlanta is a violent city. We have
03:35.020 - 03:40.580:  murderers, gang members, rapists, kidnappers are all in there. There were as a time in the past
03:40.920 - 03:45.340:  where inmates figured out a way by shoving wet paper towels into the locks so they could get out
03:45.340 - 03:50.760:  of the cells and walk around. It's an issue and relatively recently, a homeless man was in there
03:51.280 - 03:57.040:  died and they found his body two days later covered in bugs. It's dirty. There's a lot of
03:57.040 - 04:02.360:  paint chips. It's just not a nice place to be. These are Mr. Trump's fourth round of criminal charges
04:02.360 - 04:07.160:  in just a few months, but they're potentially the most serious. A trial is expected to begin
04:07.160 - 04:13.760:  as early as October the 23rd. Our correspondent, Carl Nazman, is outside the Fulton County Jail and
04:13.760 - 04:19.020:  has the latest. Right. Well, this will be a slightly different process, obviously, for a former
04:19.020 - 04:24.580:  president versus a petty criminal or a member of the public that would have the misfortune of
04:24.580 - 04:29.780:  arriving here at this jail. But what we're expecting from Donald Trump is now that he's entered
04:29.780 - 04:34.500:  the premises. He will likely have a room to himself. That's not always the case. The processing
04:34.500 - 04:39.640:  rooms can hold multiple defendants at once. He's likely to be there on his own. Of course,
04:39.640 - 04:44.480:  that's for security reasons. He'll be surrounded by secret service. He's going to be processed.
04:44.480 - 04:50.040:  That will include fingerprinting. It will include some body measurements. And then, of course,
04:50.060 - 04:54.220:  what many people are waiting for is to find out whether or not Donald Trump will have his
04:54.220 - 04:59.560:  bug shot taken. Every defendant so far that has been through the Fulton County Jail has had
04:59.560 - 05:04.820:  their mug shot taken. And that photograph has been published publicly. And we've, of course,
05:04.820 - 05:10.040:  seen his former chief of staff today, Mark Meadows, and that mug shot being released yesterday,
05:10.040 - 05:15.920:  Rudy Giuliani, one of his former top lawyers. Also, a photograph to mug shot, that was
05:15.920 - 05:21.000:  posted online as well. We've even seen one of the defendants use that mug shot as their new
05:21.000 - 05:27.340:  Twitter profile picture. So some clearly maybe using this as a badge of honor. That will be the
05:27.340 - 05:33.000:  essential process. The reason why some defendants end up with this jail and don't leave for many
05:33.100 - 05:39.780:  hours, days, even weeks is that they have now already negotiated the terms of his release.
05:39.780 - 05:45.480:  There's a bond that's already been set to $200,000. There's some restrictions in place for
05:45.480 - 05:52.700:  the former president as well. So all of that legal, um, regular role has been done. That means once
05:52.700 - 05:59.660:  the processing is over, he'll be free to go already. He has a 9 p.m. interview scheduled with
05:59.660 - 06:06.400:  Newsmax, which is a Fox News competitor, a conservative leaning American News outlet. So once again,
06:06.400 - 06:12.100:  as we've seen in the previous three criminal cases, Donald Trump, certainly take advantage of the
06:12.100 - 06:18.960:  opportunity to use this as a campaign stop, if you will, making it not just legal, but also political.
06:18.960 - 06:24.440:  And it's worth pointing out that, you know, this jail's open 24-7. Any of the defendants could
06:24.440 - 06:29.740:  turn themselves in at any time, but he did choose to arrive around 730, which is prime time in the US.
06:30.900 - 06:37.200:  Carl Nazman. President Putin has made his first public comments about the plane crash that is
06:37.200 - 06:41.920:  presumed to have killed the leader of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner. He described
06:41.920 - 06:46.260:  he have gained a precaution as a man who'd made serious mistakes, but achieved results.
06:46.260 - 06:52.000:  Wagner had played a significant role alongside Russian troops in Ukraine until Mr. Pregoshen
06:52.000 - 06:58.400:  led a short-lived mutiny exactly two months ago from Moscow, our correspondent Will Vernon sent this
07:03.700 - 07:08.880:  report. In the Kremlin today, Vladimir Putin paid tribute to Yvgeny Pregoshen and the Wagner
07:08.880 - 07:13.780:  group, who he said had significantly contributed to Russia's war in Ukraine.
07:16.840 - 07:21.020:  The Kremlin leader said Mr. Pregoshen was a person with a complicated history,
07:21.020 - 07:27.600:  who had made mistakes, but he was a talented man. President Putin went on to guarantee
07:27.600 - 07:33.840:  a full investigation would be carried out into the plane crash. Russian authorities said today
07:33.840 - 07:39.940:  that the bodies of all 10 people on board, seven passengers and three crew, had been recovered
07:39.940 - 07:46.060:  from the scene. Efforts are now underway to identify the dead. The Russian aviation authority
07:46.060 - 07:51.740:  said that Yvgeny Pregoshen and his second-in-command, Dmitry Utkin, were on board.
07:52.520 - 07:58.520:  Attention is now focused on what exactly happened to the Embraer legacy jet and whether
07:58.520 - 08:04.740:  Yvgeny Pregoshen was assassinated in a targeted attack. Rumors have been swirling around Moscow
08:04.740 - 08:11.180:  for several weeks that Mr. Pregoshen's days were numbered. Two months ago, his Wagner troops
08:11.180 - 08:16.120:  launched a mutiny, seizing a major Russian city and even marching on Moscow.
08:16.780 - 08:22.500:  The insurrection was eventually called off, but it was a significant humiliation for the Kremlin.
08:25.200 - 08:30.440:  In Moscow today, Russians told me the news about Mr. Pregoshen's plane and the Wagner
08:30.440 - 08:33.920:  Boss' reported death came as no surprise whatsoever.
08:37.860 - 08:43.560:  This wasn't really a shock, bearing a mind the whole situation. I almost expected something like this.
08:47.220 - 08:50.700:  You can't challenge the Russian leader. Bad things will happen if you do.
08:52.120 - 08:59.120:  I asked the pro Putin Russian MP, Maria Bhutina, whether it was possible the Kremlin was behind Mr.
08:59.120 - 09:05.420:  Pregoshen's killing. I don't think this is even possible. I believe that there will be investigation
09:05.580 - 09:12.420:  and if there are people who are guilty in an accident, they will be punished by our law and punish
09:12.420 - 09:18.300:  strictly. The message from the authorities here is clear. Wait for the results of the official
09:18.300 - 09:24.040:  investigation, but many Russians have already made up their minds about what happened to Yvgeny
09:24.040 - 09:30.580:  Pregoshen. They believe he broke the golden rule in Russia. Don't cross Vladimir Putin.
09:31.060 - 09:36.560:  Will Vernon? Well, as Russian officials investigate what caused Yvgeny Pregoshen's plane to fall
09:36.560 - 09:42.200:  out of the sky, Western intelligence agencies have indicated he was killed on orders from the Kremlin.
09:42.680 - 09:47.920:  One senior British defense source told the BBC it had all the hallmarks of an operation by Russia's
09:47.920 - 09:54.420:  domestic intelligence agency, the FSB, asked at a news briefing about speculation on why the plane
09:54.420 - 10:00.060:  had crashed. The Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder said the US did not believe
10:00.060 - 10:05.420:  that a surface-to-air missile had been used. Our initial assessment is that it's likely
10:06.440 - 10:13.380:  Pregoshen was killed. We're continuing to assess the situation. We don't have any information to
10:13.380 - 10:20.100:  indicate right now. The press reporting stating that there was some type of surface-to-air
10:20.100 - 10:25.320:  missile that took down the plane that we assessed that information to be inaccurate. Again, nothing
10:25.320 - 10:29.800:  to indicate. No information to suggest that there was a surface-to-air missile.
10:30.180 - 10:36.020:  Brigadier General Pat Ryder at the Pentagon. So, without its leadership, what will happen to
10:36.020 - 10:41.060:  the Vagna mercenary group? And in particular, it's operations in Africa. In Marley, for example,
10:41.060 - 10:45.860:  there are thought to be about 1,000 Vagna soldiers. They were brought in by Marley's military
10:45.860 - 10:52.020:  government to help it counter a growing insurgency by groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State.
10:52.420 - 10:57.480:  Last year, French forces ended their operation to try to stabilize the remote and yet volatile
10:57.480 - 11:03.800:  part of Africa. BBC Africa's Ferras Kalani is the first journalist to travel to Northern Marley
11:03.800 - 11:11.600:  since they pulled out. Racing across the desert. This is the start of a thousand mile journey.
11:13.060 - 11:19.680:  Across vast open lands to an unseen conflict where Vagna fighters clash with jihadist groups
11:20.620 - 11:27.700:  and separators. It's impossible to operate here without a convoy of heavy security.
11:29.660 - 11:36.400:  Guided by dozens of armed Arab-Tawaric in pickup trucks, we have swapped our jeans and shirts
11:37.160 - 11:42.960:  for their traditional blue and white robes and headscarves. Anisambles of Western culture
11:42.960 - 11:50.440:  puts us at a greater risk of kidnapping. Abdullah, the head of the convoy, says we need to blend in.
11:50.440 - 12:01.060:  We are now on the way to Qidal City, but we are currently in Timbuktu region. The desert is massive
12:01.060 - 12:06.960:  and as you can see, there are no good roads. It's very risky. There is no security here.
12:07.540 - 12:12.680:  As we speed across the desert, we dodge patrols from a group linked to Al Qaeda.
12:14.080 - 12:19.120:  It's a dangerous and difficult journey, but it's the only way to reach the camps outside
12:19.120 - 12:27.800:  the northern city of Qidal. Hundreds of people live here. Make shift tents stretched across
12:27.800 - 12:33.860:  the desert area. There's little in the way of medicine or food and some of the kids are suffering
12:33.860 - 12:42.760:  from a fever. Many are orphans who lived in an area controlled by Al Qaeda until the Islamic
12:42.760 - 12:50.000:  state attacked and killed their parents. We are standing outside the only school in the area.
12:51.160 - 12:57.200:  These children are being taught to recite verses from the Qur'an. They are hit with a stick
12:57.740 - 13:02.700:  if they get a line wrong. It's the only education they're ever likely to receive.
13:04.700 - 13:09.880:  We have spent five days on the road to reach this remote camp. These children's stories
13:10.420 - 13:15.460:  may have been hidden from the world, but they are another generation whose lives were destroyed
13:15.500 - 13:22.500:  by the so-called Islamic state. We meet Fatima sheltering in her tent, along with her daughter
13:22.500 - 13:29.600:  and grandchildren. She walked hundreds of miles from the village. They lived in to reach the camp.
13:33.400 - 13:38.200:  Islamic state forced us to come here. They forced us to come here. All our men were killed.
13:38.840 - 13:44.440:  They burned all our food. When we arrived, we found water and shelter. So we stayed here.
13:47.300 - 13:52.680:  She hadists may have been defeated in the Middle East, but their grip of the African Sahel region
13:52.680 - 14:01.020:  is growing. Many here support the cause. Al Qaeda treats us according to Islam.
14:01.560 - 14:05.540:  Our eyes doesn't treat us as Muslims. Al Qaeda helps us.
14:08.680 - 14:14.300:  Last year, help from the West was pushed aside as support on the streets for Russia grew.
14:15.260 - 14:21.520:  Many in Mali looked to Yvgeni-Burgugin, and the military operation by the French ended,
14:22.040 - 14:24.700:  as Wagner fighters took up arms in Mali.
14:29.540 - 14:35.300:  Just days ago, Burgugin appeared in this video. Some of his supporters claimed that Kreb
14:35.300 - 14:37.880:  was found in Africa, possibly even in Nali.
14:43.440 - 14:46.140:  The Wagner group conducts reconnaissance and search activities.
14:47.860 - 14:52.340:  We make Russia even greater on all continents, and Africa even more free.
14:53.860 - 14:57.020:  We are for justice and happiness for the African peoples.
14:58.280 - 15:01.760:  We terrify Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and other gangsters.
15:02.280 - 15:05.220:  His death will add to the growing power vacuum here.
15:10.160 - 15:15.020:  This month, UN bases dotted around the North, started pulling out,
15:15.600 - 15:21.780:  renewing some of the fighting. The big question now, what role can Wagner play in Africa?
15:22.440 - 15:26.040:  And who else is left to stand up to the Islamic State?
15:27.380 - 15:32.260:  Ferras Kalani. Scientists say there's been a catastrophic number of deaths
15:32.260 - 15:37.800:  among Emperor Penguin chicks in the Antarctic. Up to 10,000 young birds are estimated to have
15:37.800 - 15:42.580:  drowned or frozen to death, the sea ice on which they were being raised broke up before they'd
15:42.580 - 15:47.620:  fully developed the waterproof feathers needed to swim in the ocean. Experts say the changes to
15:47.620 - 15:52.840:  the sea ice are likely to become more common as the Antarctic warms due to global warming.
15:53.240 - 15:55.960:  Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos has this report.
15:59.920 - 16:05.260:  Emperors are the largest of Antarctica's penguins, and their existence is intimately tied
16:05.260 - 16:11.280:  to the frozen continent's ice, specifically the sea ice around the coast, which the birds use as
16:11.280 - 16:16.500:  a platform on which to breed and bring up their young. But this platform is becoming increasingly
16:16.500 - 16:22.600:  unreliable, taking longer to form in winter and breaking up earlier in summer. And that's what
16:22.600 - 16:27.760:  happened in the Belling'shausen Sea sector recently, where four Emperor colonies were devastated,
16:27.760 - 16:33.300:  their chicks drowning before they could molt their grey, downy feathers, and fledged fully waterproof
16:33.300 - 16:39.800:  plumage. Scientists fear this scenario will become more common as sea ice recedes in a warmer world.
16:39.800 - 16:43.200:  Dr Peter Fretwell is from the British Antarctic Survey.
16:43.760 - 16:49.740:  Our models predict that by the end of the century, about 80 years from now, 90% of the colonies
16:50.380 - 16:55.360:  will have become extinct. And this is really poignant because most of these penguins will never
16:55.360 - 17:00.260:  have seen a human being in their life. But it's human-induced climate change, which is driving
17:00.260 - 17:03.400:  their futures in the future, which is looking really bleak at the moment.
17:03.880 - 17:09.060:  Next month, should witness Antarctica's sea ice reach its maximum extent during what is the
17:09.060 - 17:13.660:  height of the Southern Hemisphere winter? It is far, far below where it should be,
17:14.000 - 17:17.420:  setting a new, unwelcome record. Jonathan Amos
17:20.020 - 17:22.160:  Still to come on the Global News Podcast.
17:22.640 - 17:26.560:  We finally have an athlete who's not just saying what he thinks we want to say.

18:16.880 - 18:21.480:  radioactive water from its tsunami hit Fukushima nuclear power plant.
18:21.480 - 18:26.220:  But how did the 2011 disaster happen? And could it have been prevented?
18:26.220 - 18:27.980:  It's all underwater.
18:27.980 - 18:32.720:  Station Blackout, reactor control systems have lost all power.
18:32.840 - 18:38.320:  Fukushima, a powerful podcast series from the BBC World Service, tells the story.
18:38.320 - 18:42.600:  Search for Fukushima wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
18:48.900 - 18:51.300:  I could feel stigma all around me.
18:51.380 - 18:54.480:  Nearly died three, four times. I had this secret.
18:54.840 - 19:00.320:  This is Lives Less Ordinary, a podcast dedicated to remarkable personal stories.
19:00.500 - 19:03.120:  I started having a strength in me.

19:15.600 - 19:21.840:  In Zimbabwe, around 40 election monitors have been arrested in police raids across the capital Harare,
19:22.280 - 19:24.500:  those being held are from pro-democracy groups,
19:24.500 - 19:29.080:  and are accused of trying to disrupt the voting process in an election in which the incumbent,
19:29.080 - 19:32.660:  President Emerson Emnan-Gagua, is seeking a second term.
19:32.660 - 19:37.260:  His rival, Nelson Chimesa, the leader of the Citizen Coalition for Change,
19:37.260 - 19:40.940:  is hoping to end 43 years of Zanu P.F. rule.
19:41.340 - 19:42.880:  As spokesman for his party,
19:42.880 - 19:47.060:  promise Emquan Anzi described the election as rigged.
19:47.340 - 19:50.900:  We feel that the electoral process is fundamentally flawed,
19:51.340 - 19:56.100:  and is unable to produce a free and fair electoral outcome.
19:57.560 - 20:01.600:  Nonetheless, we knew this beforehand,
20:01.600 - 20:07.940:  and we have prepared ourselves to win an unfree and unfair election.
20:08.420 - 20:10.980:  Civil society groups have tried to do their own vote count
20:10.980 - 20:16.140:  to compare results with the official tally in light of disputes over past election results.
20:16.140 - 20:20.400:  Our correspondent in Harare, Shingai Nyoka, told me more about the raids.
20:21.000 - 20:26.500:  And SOS was sent out late Wednesday night from one of the lawyers groups
20:27.040 - 20:31.080:  saying that they'd received distress calls from various staff members
20:31.580 - 20:33.980:  of these election observer groups.
20:34.520 - 20:38.180:  Zimbabwe Election Support Network, as well as the Election Resource Centre.
20:38.740 - 20:43.800:  But it was only today that we had a confirmation from the police
20:43.820 - 20:46.700:  that these people had actually been arrested.
20:47.420 - 20:50.140:  41 of them, according to the police spokesperson,
20:50.220 - 20:56.840:  and the various laptops, I think about 38, were confiscated and 93 cell phones.
20:57.320 - 21:01.640:  Now, the police are saying that they received a tip-off that led to this raid.
21:01.640 - 21:06.780:  A tip-off that the voter tabulation that was happening at one of the hotels
21:06.940 - 21:13.680:  organized by a network of observers was actually trying to preempt the presidential results
21:13.680 - 21:16.180:  and announce Nelson Chamisa as the winner.
21:16.520 - 21:21.080:  That hasn't been proved, but we're expecting them to appear in court on Thursday
21:21.540 - 21:24.100:  to learn exactly what charges they will face.
21:24.240 - 21:28.820:  But there are also accusations that the electoral body has been trying to fix the vote
21:28.820 - 21:30.300:  in favor of the ruling party.
21:30.660 - 21:35.400:  And that has been a long-standing accusation in the run-up to these elections.
21:35.400 - 21:39.700:  There were a lot of accusations against the electoral body around the boundaries,
21:39.700 - 21:41.580:  the number of polling stations.
21:42.100 - 21:46.340:  There were a lot of questions by non-governmental organizations and civil society groups
21:46.820 - 21:49.960:  about why there was a change in the number of polling stations
21:49.960 - 21:53.500:  from the initial number that was given in the Gazette.
21:53.940 - 21:58.760:  But as you mentioned earlier, these are historical issues between the opposition groups
21:58.760 - 21:59.800:  and the government.
21:59.800 - 22:02.080:  And the election results is a battlefield.
22:02.840 - 22:06.100:  And in previous elections, previous by-elections,
22:06.100 - 22:10.960:  the electoral commission, the state-run body, has urged opposition parties as well
22:10.960 - 22:15.040:  as civil society groups to set up a parallel vote to tabulations.
22:15.560 - 22:17.340:  And this is what they were trying to do.
22:17.380 - 22:19.000:  And now they've been arrested for it.
22:19.200 - 22:21.360:  Meanwhile, counting is underway.
22:21.360 - 22:23.680:  And voting has been extended in some places.
22:24.680 - 22:29.680:  Voting was extended into a second day in some constituencies in Harare,
22:29.680 - 22:32.760:  as well as the eastern province of Manicoland.
22:33.120 - 22:38.320:  What happened yesterday is that despite the electoral bodies suggesting that they were ready
22:38.320 - 22:40.360:  to hold these elections, they were not.
22:40.360 - 22:44.900:  A ballot papers arrived late at many polling stations in Harare.
22:45.260 - 22:49.980:  People were waiting for eight to ten hours for these ballot papers to arrive.
22:49.980 - 22:54.280:  And so late on Wednesday night, the president issued a proclamation
22:54.280 - 22:57.080:  extending voting day into today.
22:57.540 - 23:00.520:  And so polling stations that opened have now closed
23:01.060 - 23:02.560:  and the vote counting is underway.
23:02.560 - 23:05.860:  But it has seriously damaged the electoral body.
23:06.400 - 23:08.860:  And we have heard accusations from the opposition
23:08.900 - 23:12.300:  that this was actually an attempt to suppress voters.
23:12.800 - 23:14.440:  Shinghai Nyoka in Harare.
23:15.300 - 23:19.020:  Reports from Spain suggest the head of their football federation,
23:19.020 - 23:23.980:  Luis Rubiales, will quit his post on Friday after being roundly condemned by the
23:23.980 - 23:26.440:  football world for kissing a Spanish player,
23:26.980 - 23:29.260:  following the women's World Cup final on Sunday.
23:29.260 - 23:33.200:  Football's governing body FIFA had already started disciplinary hearings
23:33.840 - 23:34.960:  into Mr. Rubiales.
23:35.240 - 23:37.940:  Football reporter Nigel Adely has the details.
23:38.680 - 23:41.880:  Rubiales was initially defined in the aftermath of the final
23:42.400 - 23:43.700:  before later apologizing.
23:44.420 - 23:47.580:  But that wasn't enough to spare him from FIFA's disciplinary code.
23:47.820 - 23:50.820:  Article 13 refers to offensive behavior
23:50.820 - 23:53.660:  and violations of the principles of fair play.
23:54.460 - 23:56.980:  In addition to kissing Jenny Hermoso on the lips,
23:57.500 - 24:01.480:  Rubiales was filmed grabbing his crotch in celebration following the game,
24:01.480 - 24:05.540:  while stood close to the Spanish Queen Latithia and her teenage daughter.
24:05.860 - 24:09.860:  The legendary American player Megan Rapinoe has claimed the behavior portrayed
24:09.860 - 24:12.740:  a deep level of misogyny and sexism,
24:13.420 - 24:16.340:  and the pressure has steadily grown on Rubiales in Spain.
24:17.220 - 24:19.680:  Hermoso has spoken of her disgust at what happened.
24:20.420 - 24:24.020:  Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said an apology wasn't sufficient,
24:24.800 - 24:28.120:  and senior figures from across the sport called on him to go.
24:29.000 - 24:34.460:  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti also described Rubiales' actions as unacceptable.
24:37.000 - 24:38.860:  I think this is a very delicate subject.
24:39.340 - 24:42.000:  Yes, as a citizen, I think that, like most people,
24:42.000 - 24:44.520:  this type of behavior is something that I don't like.
24:44.520 - 24:50.140:  Obviously, the behavior has not been the behavior of a president of a federation.
24:51.420 - 24:53.600:  Rubiales has been a very powerful figure,
24:54.160 - 24:58.220:  also serving as a vice president for UEFA, who run European football.
24:59.120 - 25:03.320:  And this controversy comes at a time when Spain is also bidding to co-host
25:03.320 - 25:08.620:  the Centenary World Cup in 2030, and Rubiales has been central to that.
25:09.520 - 25:12.120:  A decision will be taken late next year.
25:12.220 - 25:18.080:  The Spanish football community will now hope to limit the reputational damage caused by Rubiales,
25:18.560 - 25:22.300:  but there's no doubt this episode has completely overshadowed
25:22.660 - 25:26.420:  what should have been a moment of triumph for the country's women's football team.
25:26.860 - 25:27.840:  Nigel Adely
25:28.640 - 25:31.200:  We are here and no one will keep us quiet.
25:31.380 - 25:36.040:  The defiant message of a drag artist in Lebanon who was applauded when a show was
25:36.040 - 25:41.600:  disrupted by a homophobic Christian group in footage of the attack circulating on social media.
25:41.920 - 25:44.720:  A man outside the venue in Beirut is heard yelling,
25:44.720 - 25:48.100:  this is only the beginning, we've warned you 100 times.
25:48.700 - 25:51.660:  With more, here's our Arab Affairs editor, Sebastian Asha.
25:52.180 - 25:57.620:  Members of a hardline anti-LGBT Christian group calling itself the soldiers of God
25:58.200 - 26:01.200:  disrupted a drag show in the upmarket, Marma Hale,
26:01.200 - 26:03.880:  district in Beirut, late on Wednesday night.
26:04.380 - 26:07.160:  Staff rushed to close the doors to protect the audience,
26:07.160 - 26:11.200:  as the activist screamed homophobic abuse outside the venue.
26:11.740 - 26:13.560:  One of the drag artists hosting the event,
26:13.580 - 26:17.800:  Immigration, stepped on stage and brought the show to an early close.
26:18.020 - 26:21.000:  The Arab here, we exist, and no one will keep us quiet.
26:25.680 - 26:29.820:  However, sometimes to keep doing what we're doing, we have to do it smartly.
26:31.140 - 26:33.000:  Unfortunately, we have to cut the show short.
26:34.060 - 26:37.660:  I know there's no reason to be worried or anything,
26:37.880 - 26:39.380:  but better be safe than sorry.
26:39.680 - 26:43.240:  The drag artist and some of the audience took refuge in the changing area
26:43.240 - 26:46.620:  for about 40 minutes until the security forces arrived.
26:47.440 - 26:52.040:  Lebanon has long been seen as one of the most open countries, both socially and culturally
26:52.040 - 26:53.160:  in the Middle East.
26:53.500 - 26:57.660:  It has recently been witnessing an escalating anti-LGBT campaign,
26:58.240 - 26:59.900:  not just from conservative Christians,
26:59.900 - 27:03.740:  but from other communities in the country's complex religious framework.
27:03.740 - 27:06.920:  Hassan Nazrallah, the leader of a powerful Shia,
27:06.920 - 27:10.400:  Muslim Hasbullah movement, has been spearheading the campaign.
27:10.460 - 27:13.700:  Just last month, he said that gay people should be killed,
27:14.260 - 27:17.280:  even if, as he put it, they only do it once.
27:17.340 - 27:23.400:  The LGBT community in Lebanon is used to dealing with sporadic crackdowns by the authorities
27:23.500 - 27:27.780:  that sees the latest developments as a dangerous turn for the worse.
27:28.200 - 27:29.260:  Sebastian Usher
27:30.260 - 27:35.920:  Fast and feisty, Shikari Richardson is the must see star of the World Athletics Championships
27:35.920 - 27:36.780:  in Hungary.
27:36.780 - 27:40.040:  On Monday, she won a thrilling 100 meters final.
27:40.220 - 27:43.680:  Richardson has been described as a role model for youngsters growing up
27:43.680 - 27:49.020:  in challenging circumstances, but she's also seen as controversial and sometimes volatile.
27:49.020 - 27:53.140:  Whatever your opinion of the 23-year-old Texan, she's essential viewing,
27:53.140 - 27:55.700:  and she's back on the track over the next few days.
27:55.700 - 28:00.000:  From Hungary, here's our Sports News correspondent, Alex Kapstik.
28:02.300 - 28:04.320:  Sheliant, here's a price plus soda of the blocks.
28:04.540 - 28:06.720:  Budapest is her first major championship.
28:07.260 - 28:09.940:  So far, it's been a stunning debut.
28:12.780 - 28:16.460:  Dazzling on the track, but off it, things can get awkward.
28:16.740 - 28:19.060:  Well, obviously I didn't make the team let me show you.
28:19.060 - 28:20.520:  I don't think you had to say that, but,
28:21.120 - 28:23.700:  blacking out the noise, blacking out media like yourself,
28:24.380 - 28:25.780:  and just continuing to go forward.
28:26.840 - 28:27.320:  I feel great.
28:28.100 - 28:31.480:  Every so often, an athlete comes along who demands attention.
28:32.100 - 28:34.000:  Shikari Richardson does just that.
28:34.640 - 28:35.820:  There was a difficult childhood.
28:36.080 - 28:37.620:  Her mother walked out when she was young.
28:38.280 - 28:40.680:  She was, though, a fast runner and found sport.
28:41.440 - 28:44.740:  But even that turns sour when, just before the Tokyo Olympics,
28:45.260 - 28:46.740:  she tested positive for marijuana.
28:47.780 - 28:50.200:  Sensational, spiky, and sensitive.
28:50.720 - 28:51.940:  Perceptions of her differ.
28:52.720 - 28:57.240:  Few people know Richardson better than her manager, the former athlete, Ronaldo Nemeier.
28:57.640 - 29:00.820:  Well, I guess in today's term, she can be polarising.
29:00.820 - 29:05.520:  She's kind of a rebel and she reflects young kids want to do and say whatever they want to say
29:05.520 - 29:06.920:  and be free to do what they want to do.
29:07.660 - 29:12.480:  My opinion, it's a defence mechanism because she's very much afraid and she's a fighter.
29:12.680 - 29:13.420:  So she's going to fight.
29:13.420 - 29:17.840:  She can read 1000 positive comments and she'll find out one negative and she'll fight.
29:18.160 - 29:19.580:  She's definitely what our sport needs.
29:20.180 - 29:20.920:  She's charismatic.
29:21.500 - 29:23.720:  If she were a male, no one would have a problem with it.
29:23.960 - 29:28.040:  But she's a woman and so she's very boisterous and flamboyant.
29:28.160 - 29:32.240:  There were oftentimes where I felt shut out and she wasn't talking to me,
29:32.460 - 29:34.420:  but it wasn't me, which is what she was going through.
29:35.300 - 29:35.920:  And it takes time.
29:35.920 - 29:36.660:  That's the other thing.
29:36.660 - 29:39.100:  She's very non-trusting and so you have to earn it.
29:39.620 - 29:41.680:  I didn't experience what she did growing up
29:42.200 - 29:45.200:  and so I would always tell people with the naysayers, you don't know her.
29:45.520 - 29:46.900:  Everybody matures at different times.
29:47.300 - 29:49.420:  I mean, she said the sport needs people like her.
29:49.740 - 29:50.080:  It does.
29:50.080 - 29:52.960:  And these people like her just to be the authentic self.
29:53.140 - 29:56.560:  I recall when she was disqualified from our trials
29:56.560 - 30:00.600:  because of the marijuana ban and then she went on a national show the next day
30:01.100 - 30:01.760:  and owned it.
30:02.180 - 30:05.000:  And it won over a lot of more fans because they're like,
30:05.160 - 30:09.000:  we finally have an athlete who's not just saying what he thinks we want to say.
30:09.360 - 30:10.440:  She's like, I'm in perfect.
30:10.620 - 30:13.520:  I made a mistake and I'm not going to apologize for being human.
30:14.080 - 30:17.880:  And I think that's why people connect with her because like it or not,
30:17.880 - 30:19.600:  she's going to tell you what she really feels.
30:20.200 - 30:21.240:  She's not trying to be rude.
30:21.860 - 30:23.100:  She's just raw.
30:24.380 - 30:28.600:  Gold medalers and World Athletics Champion
30:29.880 - 30:31.960:  representing the United States of America,
30:32.980 - 30:34.360:  Shikari Richardson.
30:35.340 - 30:35.360:  CHEERING
30:37.720 - 30:38.720:  One thing is clear.
30:39.060 - 30:41.760:  Here in Budapest, Shikari Richardson is a star.
30:42.320 - 30:46.000:  At the 100 metres metal ceremony on a plaza just outside the stadium,
30:46.460 - 30:48.220:  there's a packed crowd, mostly locals.
30:48.880 - 30:51.100:  And there's no question who's side there on.
30:51.340 - 30:54.100:  Yeah, yeah, very inspirational figure for sure
30:54.520 - 30:56.780:  for everyone watching all around the world, 100%.
30:56.780 - 30:58.140:  I like her message.
30:58.720 - 30:59.780:  Don't give up on your failures.
30:59.780 - 31:01.620:  That's definitely something very inspirational.
31:02.180 - 31:05.020:  Yeah, I will definitely be looking to hear more from her
31:05.240 - 31:07.540:  and hopefully look out for more of her successes.
31:09.420 - 31:13.140:  And it's not over yet for Shikari Richardson here in Budapest.
31:13.620 - 31:16.140:  There's the 200 metres followed by the relays.
31:16.720 - 31:18.940:  And whatever happens, the word is spreading.
31:19.500 - 31:23.940:  And this latest star of the sport is being watched every step of the way.
31:26.400 - 31:28.100:  Alex Capcirc with that report.
