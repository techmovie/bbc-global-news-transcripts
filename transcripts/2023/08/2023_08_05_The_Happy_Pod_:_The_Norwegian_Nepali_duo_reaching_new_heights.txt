00:17.680 - 00:22.700:  With the price of just about everything going up during inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down.
00:23.180 - 00:26.960:  So to help us, we brought in a reverse auctioneer, which is apparently a thing.

00:47.240 - 00:48.600:  This is a check from Carvana.
00:48.740 - 00:49.720:  I just sold my card to them.
00:49.840 - 00:51.760:  I went online and Carvana gave me an offer right away.
00:51.760 - 00:53.820:  Then they just picked up the car and gave me this.
00:54.400 - 00:55.620:  What's a big check?
00:55.620 - 00:57.860:  Well, obviously you could put this towards your next car,
00:58.000 - 00:59.800:  or we could finally get that jacuzzi,
00:59.800 - 01:01.700:  or I could start taking tuba lessons,
01:01.700 - 01:04.240:  or I could quit my job and write my memoir.
01:04.460 - 01:06.740:  Or I can put it towards my next car with Carvana.
01:06.940 - 01:08.600:  Sorry, your check, not mine.
01:08.840 - 01:10.220:  Sell your card to Carvana.

01:20.180 - 01:22.520:  Hi, my name is Evie. I am from Nigeria.
01:25.120 - 01:26.440:  I'm Monica from Poland.
01:26.900 - 01:28.220:  This is the happy pod.
01:28.500 - 01:29.960:  Welcome to the happy pod.
01:30.100 - 01:32.160:  Welcome to this week's happy pod.
01:32.500 - 01:35.560:  This is indeed the happy pod from the BBC World Service.
01:40.980 - 01:42.600:  I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition,
01:42.600 - 01:44.720:  uploaded on Saturday the 5th of August.
01:45.340 - 01:48.720:  The climbers who've completed the fastest descent of the world's
01:48.720 - 01:51.560:  14 highest mountains in record time.
01:51.720 - 01:55.200:  We got the harpist who played a concert at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro.
01:55.580 - 01:57.120:  The sun came out.
01:57.700 - 02:00.380:  The music was just so crisp and clear,
02:00.380 - 02:02.200:  because the air was just so beautiful.
02:02.460 - 02:05.040:  We'll be celebrating another musician, Felix Cleaser,
02:05.380 - 02:08.200:  born without arms, but able to wow concert audiences
02:08.200 - 02:10.460:  by playing the French horn with his feet.
02:11.100 - 02:14.000:  When you make music, you make music for people to make people happy.
02:14.020 - 02:15.860:  When I have the feeling that the audience is happy
02:15.860 - 02:18.360:  and enjoys the concert, then I'm happy too.
02:18.720 - 02:21.380:  Also in this podcast, the Nigerian prodigy.
02:21.580 - 02:24.400:  Seeking to inspire others to take up, Chess.
02:24.920 - 02:28.960:  Chess hoped to have alternative plans to see the big picture,
02:29.280 - 02:30.640:  to contour your emotions.
02:31.280 - 02:34.200:  You have to think it is what's just again.
02:40.260 - 02:45.380:  The record to scale the world's 14 highest mountains has been broken.
02:45.940 - 02:48.180:  Norwegian, Christian Harala and Napoleon,
02:48.180 - 02:51.840:  in Lama Sherpa, completed their feet in 92 days,
02:51.840 - 02:55.480:  that's three months and five days faster than the previous record.
02:56.020 - 02:58.320:  The pair's final summit was K2 in Pakistan,
02:58.320 - 03:00.440:  the world's second highest mountain,
03:00.440 - 03:03.960:  and all 14 peaks were above 8,000 meters.
03:04.540 - 03:06.940:  Christian told us about their extraordinary achievement.
03:07.640 - 03:11.060:  It was very, very special and we were very happy.
03:11.060 - 03:15.580:  We had a very tough and hard climb up to the summit of K2,
03:15.800 - 03:19.600:  but most of all on the summit, we knew that we were halfway.
03:19.600 - 03:22.820:  We still had to climb down, so we were happy,
03:22.820 - 03:26.220:  but we were focused on getting safely back down also.
03:26.940 - 03:33.020:  So these 14 summits in record time, how did you manage it?
03:33.160 - 03:35.880:  I know that there was a bit of controversy over the use of some
03:36.160 - 03:37.940:  very modern equipment and that sort of help,
03:37.960 - 03:39.800:  but talk us through how you managed it.
03:40.220 - 03:43.300:  I think a lot of the information that came out about helicopter
03:44.040 - 03:48.280:  wrong information, it sounded like we have been flying helicopter off,
03:48.400 - 03:49.600:  but of course we have it.
03:49.640 - 03:53.580:  We have been climbing the whole way from base camp to the summit and back.
03:53.720 - 03:56.740:  And of course it's a hard job when we're out there.
03:56.740 - 04:01.860:  Sometimes we arrive base camp and maybe we rest a couple of hours
04:01.980 - 04:07.140:  and then we start to climb and sometimes we climb up to camp one or camp two
04:07.140 - 04:11.380:  and it can take us five to ten hours and then we rest a couple hours
04:11.560 - 04:15.340:  and then we continue to the next camp and then we go for the summit push
04:15.340 - 04:18.080:  and maybe that takes 28 hours or something.
04:18.480 - 04:21.080:  I think the longest we have done has been more than 40 hours,
04:21.340 - 04:24.800:  so it's not much rest and of course it gets very very tired.
04:25.620 - 04:27.700:  I'm feeling exhausted just listening to that.
04:28.100 - 04:32.240:  You didn't just break the record, you absolutely smashed it.
04:32.980 - 04:37.520:  Were you confident throughout that that was the way it was going to go?
04:38.100 - 04:41.160:  Were you prepared to sort of allow yourself some more rest
04:41.200 - 04:41.960:  when you needed it?
04:42.100 - 04:46.020:  As we climb during the spring in First Tibet and then Nepal,
04:46.100 - 04:50.880:  we kind of saw there was a chance that we could complete all the nine
04:50.880 - 04:53.240:  that we have in Tibet and Nepal in the spring.
04:53.240 - 04:58.560:  Then we managed to do that but we knew that we still had the five months in Pakistan left
04:58.560 - 05:01.060:  and we know that some of them are very challenging.
05:01.680 - 05:02.900:  What is next for you?
05:03.240 - 05:05.520:  How do you cap this?
05:05.520 - 05:06.420:  What do you do next?
05:06.900 - 05:10.640:  I'm going to be home and get children and get married.
05:11.920 - 05:12.860:  Do you have someone in mind?
05:13.900 - 05:14.460:  Yeah, I do.
05:14.460 - 05:14.860:  I do.
05:15.540 - 05:19.720:  It's been very very hard to be away from my boyfriend and my family also,
05:19.720 - 05:23.060:  so now I'm very glad that I can spend some more time with them.
05:23.200 - 05:26.660:  I came back on Monday and we had a celebration here in Oslo.
05:27.020 - 05:32.300:  And today we are actually going back to Nepal to have a celebration together with Lama
05:32.300 - 05:33.460:  and the team there.
05:33.980 - 05:38.720:  Obviously you have an incredible working relationship with Tenjin Lama Sherpa.
05:39.300 - 05:40.140:  Are you friends as well?
05:40.140 - 05:40.880:  Do you really get on?
05:40.880 - 05:42.880:  Do you have to get on if you're doing something like this?
05:43.360 - 05:44.180:  Yeah, we have to.
05:44.600 - 05:48.660:  And that noise and that funny thing and it just says so much about human being
05:48.700 - 05:52.640:  but when I met him in March he didn't speak a word English
05:53.120 - 05:55.760:  and I, a couple of words, Nepali,
05:56.260 - 05:58.220:  but we understood each other perfectly.
05:59.660 - 06:03.780:  And since then we have been together and spent so much time together
06:03.780 - 06:07.720:  and really good friends and he's just amazing
06:07.720 - 06:11.460:  and not just the strongest chef but I have ever seen
06:11.460 - 06:15.720:  but he's also the kindest and taking so much care of me
06:15.720 - 06:18.400:  and we have had so much fun, nice time
06:18.520 - 06:20.160:  and also of course hard time together.
06:21.080 - 06:24.140:  Norwegian climber Christian Harala and congratulations to her
06:24.160 - 06:25.600:  and Tenjin Lama Sherpa.
06:26.640 - 06:29.620:  Plastic is obviously really useful stuff
06:29.760 - 06:31.880:  but hundreds of millions of tons of it
06:31.880 - 06:34.880:  are produced every year and that's bad news for the environment
06:35.180 - 06:37.220:  because it can take years for it to break down.
06:38.000 - 06:42.300:  That's where scientist Eleftheria Rumeli and her colleagues come in.
06:42.540 - 06:46.560:  They have come up with a new plastic using powdered blue green
06:46.560 - 06:49.120:  cyanobacteria cells known as spirulina
06:49.600 - 06:51.560:  that can be used to make hard shapes
06:51.560 - 06:55.340:  but which in the right conditions will decompose like fruit.
06:56.240 - 06:59.200:  We actually use food material to make it
06:59.480 - 07:01.840:  so the type of biomass that we use
07:02.040 - 07:05.260:  because it is made of proteins, carbohydrates, fats
07:05.600 - 07:07.820:  and that's why we actually have it as a food supplement
07:08.320 - 07:09.560:  we you can eat it.
07:09.720 - 07:11.160:  So you can eat your plastic?
07:12.540 - 07:14.660:  Yes, however we have done transformation
07:14.660 - 07:17.380:  heat induced trans, we have toasted it.
07:18.700 - 07:21.660:  It doesn't smell like burnt fish or something.
07:23.540 - 07:26.560:  We have other plastic that we develop from fruits
07:26.560 - 07:28.740:  like from strawberry or banana
07:29.460 - 07:32.120:  these smell much nicer so when we do these in the lab
07:32.120 - 07:34.080:  you can come and it's more pleasant.
07:34.540 - 07:36.500:  So what can you actually make with this stuff?
07:36.820 - 07:41.020:  You can imagine it for single-use plastics that are in contact with your food
07:41.020 - 07:42.780:  for example your cutlery, your plates.
07:42.780 - 07:45.440:  However I think that these are not the best uses.
07:45.840 - 07:48.520:  This material does have significant structural properties
07:48.520 - 07:50.840:  so it can carry a lot of load before it breaks
07:51.160 - 07:52.940:  so you can actually build like your closet
07:52.940 - 07:57.400:  and it can carry the load of your books and your clothes, your desk, your chair.
07:57.720 - 08:00.440:  I think those applications are a little better use
08:00.440 - 08:03.880:  because they utilize the strength of the material.
08:04.200 - 08:05.660:  However this is not a product.
08:05.860 - 08:07.600:  We have not made a product.
08:08.000 - 08:10.840:  So it's a step on the way but it's not actually a product
08:10.840 - 08:12.740:  as such just yet.
08:13.300 - 08:14.900:  And it is interesting as you were saying that other
08:15.240 - 08:17.340:  scientists and entrepreneurs are working towards
08:18.040 - 08:21.500:  creating fully biodegradable plastic right now.
08:22.080 - 08:23.300:  Let's hear from Chan Lau.
08:23.300 - 08:27.100:  He's the co-founder of an Australian company called Casava Bags.
08:27.220 - 08:30.480:  So our magic ingredient is Casava Cran and more specifically
08:30.480 - 08:31.760:  we use the starches.
08:32.200 - 08:33.920:  So there's no microplastics when it breaks down
08:34.460 - 08:35.620:  and there's no toxins as well.
08:35.980 - 08:38.560:  It can dissolve in hot water in under 60 seconds
08:39.140 - 08:41.180:  and it will compost in six to eight months.
08:41.920 - 08:45.280:  So how important do you think it is that lots of different minds,
08:45.280 - 08:48.040:  different scientists, different researchers and entrepreneurs
08:48.420 - 08:51.120:  are all coming at this problem from different directions?
08:51.700 - 08:54.240:  It is very important that we find solutions that are
08:54.780 - 08:56.860:  approaching the problem from multiple ways.
08:57.360 - 09:00.720:  So people are trying, I guess, from different points of view
09:01.180 - 09:02.700:  to give solutions to this problem.
09:02.820 - 09:06.100:  So for us, what we have in our generation, I guess,
09:06.100 - 09:07.740:  is a thing called interdisciplinary
09:08.020 - 09:11.620:  because we need all of these different expertise
09:12.180 - 09:13.180:  to be pulled together.
09:13.200 - 09:15.360:  I don't think that this specific material
09:15.360 - 09:16.520:  is going to change the world.
09:16.880 - 09:20.260:  But I do think that our students and the people that we reach
09:20.560 - 09:23.500:  and the way that we teach them how to think about
09:23.500 - 09:26.100:  designing materials, I think this is going to
09:26.480 - 09:28.280:  have a higher potential and a higher impact.
09:28.440 - 09:30.860:  And for me, that's the most important thing.
09:30.860 - 09:33.180:  It's not what I, you know, my team now
09:33.180 - 09:36.200:  at this one particular year made this contribution.
09:36.340 - 09:38.020:  I don't think anybody's going to remember that.
09:38.260 - 09:39.640:  And I don't care for that.
09:39.740 - 09:42.120:  I do care that all of these people, then afterwards,
09:42.120 - 09:43.640:  they're going to make changes.
09:44.060 - 09:47.060:  And little by little, that's how you get to results, I think.
09:47.720 - 09:51.280:  A left-through room alley of the University of Washington in Seattle.
09:53.300 - 09:59.360:  That is French horn player, Felix Cleezer,
09:59.360 - 10:01.960:  playing with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra,
10:01.960 - 10:04.180:  a glorious sound by any measure.
10:04.760 - 10:05.960:  But all the more impressive, when you realize that Felix was born
10:05.980 - 10:09.760:  without arms, and so instead of fingers, he's playing with his toes.
10:09.760 - 10:12.120:  The 32-year-old German has just made his debut
10:12.620 - 10:15.960:  at one of the biggest events for any classical musician.
10:15.960 - 10:18.580:  The BBC Proms at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
10:19.020 - 10:21.080:  And he spoke to us from there.
10:21.080 - 10:23.580:  When you make music, you make music for people, to make people happy.
10:23.840 - 10:25.980:  And this is the most important thing for me.
10:27.080 - 10:28.120:  And when I have the feeling that the audience is happy
10:29.120 - 10:30.140:  and enjoys the concert, then I'm happy too.
10:30.140 - 10:33.460:  And for this, it doesn't matter where you play, in which city,
10:33.460 - 10:33.720:  in which country, most important things are,
10:34.580 - 10:35.680:  that the people are happy.
10:36.900 - 10:38.020:  And this is the most important thing for me.
10:38.840 - 10:41.980:  And when I have the feeling that the audience is happy
10:41.980 - 10:43.880:  and enjoys the concert, then I'm happy too.
10:43.880 - 10:48.120:  The important things are that the people are having a beautiful time.
10:48.700 - 10:51.420:  So you're horn, you play it with your feet, don't you?
10:51.560 - 10:53.360:  So do you have to have an instrument
10:53.360 - 10:56.220:  that is particularly adapted for you?
10:56.360 - 10:58.220:  How do you get around the physical issues
10:58.820 - 11:00.180:  of playing an instrument like this?
11:00.680 - 11:02.180:  No, it's a normal horn.
11:02.360 - 11:04.620:  So everyone who can play the horn can play my instrument.
11:05.220 - 11:07.900:  So now, in the end, it's not an adapted instrument.
11:09.040 - 11:10.900:  In the end, you know, the fingering of the things
11:10.900 - 11:13.820:  are doing, it's not that important with a French horn.
11:13.820 - 11:16.280:  It's not like a piano, like a violin,
11:16.280 - 11:17.600:  when you play piano, a violin,
11:18.100 - 11:20.060:  then the fingering is very, very important.
11:20.060 - 11:22.560:  But with a French horn, the most important thing is a mouse
11:23.280 - 11:26.520:  and your lips, your air, how you breathe, and so on.
11:26.900 - 11:28.240:  This is the most important thing.
11:28.520 - 11:31.720:  So, and of course, this was also, when I learned the French horn,
11:31.720 - 11:33.140:  this was the most challenging thing.
11:33.340 - 11:36.340:  So you started playing when you were a very small boy,
11:36.400 - 11:37.800:  didn't you? Tell us a bit more about that.
11:38.500 - 11:40.260:  Well, yes, I started to play the French horn
11:40.260 - 11:43.220:  when I was four years old, and then my family in the round
11:43.240 - 11:45.620:  there's no one making music, there's no musician.
11:46.440 - 11:48.760:  And of course, there's no one playing the French horn.
11:48.800 - 11:51.240:  And there was never in a concert where I've seen the instrument
11:51.240 - 11:52.960:  and said, well, this looks so beautiful.
11:52.960 - 11:54.240:  I want to learn this instrument.
11:54.880 - 11:57.960:  So, where I've got to contact with this instrument
11:57.960 - 11:59.980:  and from where I got the idea.
12:00.180 - 12:01.620:  This is a really big miracle.
12:02.520 - 12:05.320:  It is. And I mean, you had some quite serious difficulties
12:05.320 - 12:08.000:  to overcome in order to become a musician,
12:08.060 - 12:10.860:  in order specifically to become a horn player.
12:11.080 - 12:11.960:  Talk us through that.
12:12.740 - 12:14.720:  At the beginning, I have to tell you, learning an instrument
12:14.720 - 12:17.360:  and becoming a musician is very difficult.
12:17.360 - 12:20.240:  It doesn't matter who you are, what you are, how talented you are.
12:20.800 - 12:22.460:  It's something of the most difficult.
12:22.460 - 12:24.460:  So it's like becoming a professional football player,
12:24.460 - 12:27.780:  because when you grew up and when you want to learn an instrument,
12:27.780 - 12:29.020:  then it can be really frustrating,
12:29.020 - 12:31.380:  because you have many, many problems in your life.
12:32.000 - 12:33.740:  We have many situations where you have the feeling,
12:33.740 - 12:36.140:  okay, there's the limit, and you cannot overcome
12:36.140 - 12:37.800:  or jump over this limit.
12:37.980 - 12:39.900:  And when you have to decide, okay,
12:39.900 - 12:41.560:  should I go on with the situation,
12:41.560 - 12:44.080:  should I go on with the instrument,
12:44.800 - 12:46.740:  or should I stop here and accept this number?
12:46.740 - 12:48.900:  And this is something which is very difficult,
12:49.440 - 12:51.980:  but in the end, it's something that's very difficult for everyone.
12:52.360 - 12:54.300:  Do you think that the audiences for classical music
12:54.300 - 12:55.700:  are becoming more diverse?
12:55.700 - 12:57.620:  Would you like to see a change in the way
12:57.620 - 12:59.440:  that people approach classical music?
12:59.860 - 13:01.340:  The most important thing is where you play.
13:01.340 - 13:03.160:  When you travel to Asia, when you play in Asia,
13:03.660 - 13:05.040:  the audience is very young.
13:05.040 - 13:07.860:  So I would say my age is the old age.
13:07.860 - 13:11.560:  So they are about 20, something between 20 and 30,
13:11.560 - 13:14.360:  you can find in a concert when you're playing Asia.
13:15.000 - 13:17.940:  When you play in Europe or specific in Germany,
13:17.940 - 13:20.380:  then the audience is much older.
13:20.980 - 13:23.240:  So it depends on why you play.
13:23.840 - 13:25.440:  And what does music do for you?
13:25.440 - 13:26.260:  What does it give you?
13:26.700 - 13:29.220:  I think it's a good or the best way
13:30.600 - 13:34.520:  with which you can communicate emotions and way of thinking.
13:34.520 - 13:37.800:  The way that you have the chance to learn new pieces,
13:38.320 - 13:40.240:  this is something which makes music interesting.
13:40.300 - 13:42.700:  So in the end, I cannot say this is my favorite piece,
13:42.700 - 13:43.860:  or this is my favorite composer,
13:44.480 - 13:47.600:  because I will say in the end to be able to play
13:47.600 - 13:50.080:  as many things as possible.
13:50.640 - 13:52.580:  This is the most beautiful thing in making music.
13:59.360 - 14:01.500:  Felix Cleezer, and you can hear his prom
14:01.900 - 14:04.920:  and most of the BBC prom season on BBC Sounds.
14:05.980 - 14:07.160:  Now, time for a listener.
14:36.120 - 14:39.320:  This sound accompanies me every single day.
14:39.920 - 14:41.800:  I saved it as MP3.
14:42.320 - 14:46.820:  Now, every phone call I receive is my happy two-year-old bubbling to me.
14:51.340 - 14:55.820:  No phone call I receive has ever been a bad one since the tune changed.
15:01.880 - 15:02.760:  Still to come.
15:03.300 - 15:04.580:  I am part of my daughter.
15:04.880 - 15:06.080:  As a father, I have landed.
15:06.080 - 15:08.800:  It is not just about winning trophies or accolades.
15:09.080 - 15:12.640:  We will hear about a remarkable young chess prodigy in Nigeria.
15:19.820 - 15:21.700:  Earlier, we heard about climbing mountains,
15:22.180 - 15:24.180:  and we've heard about a very impressive musician.
15:24.380 - 15:28.180:  Now, let's combine those things and meet Irish harpist Shavorn Brady.
15:28.380 - 15:33.220:  She is just back in Ireland after hiking to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania
15:33.600 - 15:35.420:  and then playing a 20-minute concert.
15:35.800 - 15:41.000:  No mean feat when you consider summit is 5,895 metres up.
15:41.000 - 15:46.100:  She is hoping to beat her own Guinness World Record for the highest altitude harp performance.
15:46.100 - 15:48.140:  She told us about her ascent.
15:48.600 - 15:50.760:  We started climbing at midnight.
15:50.760 - 15:53.700:  In the complete darkness, all our water froze.
15:54.380 - 15:55.680:  We had head torches on.
15:55.980 - 16:00.660:  We were kept awake solely by our guides and porters singing to us.
16:00.820 - 16:05.600:  And Dawn broke at 6am and we got to the summit at 8.
16:05.960 - 16:07.380:  We had the most beautiful weather.
16:07.380 - 16:11.920:  So I had like a down jacket and down mittens and hand warmers.
16:12.100 - 16:15.540:  And I didn't end up needing them because the sun came out.
16:15.860 - 16:19.100:  And it was surprisingly warm, still very cold.
16:19.560 - 16:22.240:  The music was just so crisp and clear.
16:22.240 - 16:23.980:  The air was just so beautiful.
16:24.280 - 16:26.600:  And how did you choose the music to perform?
16:27.160 - 16:31.280:  So I got in contact with a few composers around Ireland.
16:31.280 - 16:37.660:  So a few of them were written by my teacher, Janet Harbison, who ran the school in Limerick.
16:37.720 - 16:40.060:  She's actually a Grammy award-winning composer.
16:40.580 - 16:43.780:  So I played a piece called by Strangford Water.
16:53.200 - 16:57.100:  You talk about the magic of the performance and the magic of the moment.
16:57.100 - 17:01.280:  But getting there must have been a real test of resilience.
17:01.940 - 17:04.280:  And you've talked about the harp as being more portable.
17:04.620 - 17:05.600:  But who carried it?
17:05.600 - 17:08.300:  And at any point did you think I wish I'd learnt the piccolo?
17:08.540 - 17:10.080:  Well, it is the symbol of Ireland.
17:10.240 - 17:12.060:  Like it was just the most beautiful image.
17:12.060 - 17:17.060:  It wouldn't have been anyway as more beautiful if it was any other instruments, I think.
17:17.100 - 17:18.540:  We were going to carry it.
17:18.600 - 17:21.500:  And so we had two years of practicing.
17:22.040 - 17:27.700:  We went once a month to various mountains around Ireland and abroad.
17:27.700 - 17:31.020:  And we did different methods of carrying the harp.
17:31.100 - 17:34.020:  So we used like a flight box with poles.
17:34.340 - 17:36.480:  Or then we tried to turn it into a backpack.
17:36.500 - 17:42.280:  We were told by our guides when we got there that if we attempted to carry it,
17:42.400 - 17:44.300:  over half the team wouldn't make it to the summit.
17:44.660 - 17:51.580:  So we decided to give the knowledge that we had created to the African team over there.
17:51.580 - 17:57.160:  We had six or eight porters and guides who went up a very fast route with the harp.
17:57.240 - 17:58.980:  So it only took two days to get up.
17:59.060 - 18:02.880:  So we took five days because we had to acclimatize to the altitude.
18:03.100 - 18:04.920:  What sort of reaction have you had?
18:05.100 - 18:06.880:  It's actually just been shocking.
18:06.880 - 18:08.860:  I wasn't expecting anything at all.
18:09.020 - 18:16.440:  When we got off of the plane, the director of the airport of Kilimanjaro had a dance troop
18:16.480 - 18:18.080:  waiting for us on the runway.
18:18.440 - 18:23.720:  Do you have a message for the people from Tanzania who helped you make this incredible
18:23.720 - 18:26.160:  ascent and perform the way that you did?
18:26.320 - 18:27.620:  Just a message of thanks.
18:27.620 - 18:31.380:  The phrase I got given was Tanzania unforgettable.
18:31.460 - 18:33.220:  And it honestly does sum it up.
18:33.920 - 18:37.420:  Pop is Chavorn Brady, who's definitely heard the piccolo joke before.
18:38.420 - 18:41.120:  Now, a few of the other things that caught our attention this week.
18:41.120 - 18:46.740:  You might have seen the tale of luck and unity from India, where 11 women have hit the jackpot.
18:46.740 - 18:50.400:  The women, all garbage collectors from the southern state of Kerala,
18:50.600 - 18:52.520:  couldn't afford individual lottery tickets.
18:52.520 - 18:55.320:  So they pulled their money to buy just one.
18:55.700 - 18:58.460:  Now they are sharing the jackpot of 100 million rupees.
18:58.900 - 19:00.480:  That's around $1.2 million.
19:00.500 - 19:02.200:  Congratulations to them.
19:02.500 - 19:05.740:  And let's hear from Farmer Lee Wilson from Kansas in the US,
19:06.320 - 19:09.580:  who has seriously raised the bar on anniversary presents.
19:10.160 - 19:13.720:  We're celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary, August 10th.
19:13.760 - 19:17.800:  And, you know, what's a guy get his gal on their 50th.
19:18.060 - 19:20.060:  And I put a lot of thought into it.
19:20.940 - 19:23.920:  And she always liked sunflowers.
19:24.280 - 19:26.280:  And I thought this is the year to plant sunflowers.
19:26.280 - 19:29.400:  So we planted her 80 acres of sunflowers.
19:29.820 - 19:33.220:  That's a massive field of 1.2 million sunflowers,
19:33.220 - 19:37.580:  as a surprise gift for his wife Renee to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary.
19:37.580 - 19:41.720:  And yes, I will get a picture of that on various social media using the hashtag
19:41.720 - 19:43.680:  the happy pod, because it's lovely.
19:44.200 - 19:46.820:  Two Nigerian out of here from Yvye Urieto,
19:46.820 - 19:51.940:  a brilliant chess player who believes the game can be a positive force for social change.
19:52.600 - 19:52.960:  She's eight.
19:52.960 - 19:57.960:  She's already won numerous medals and intends to be a grand master by the time she turns 15.
19:58.580 - 20:02.340:  I didn't expect me to start seeing chess at the age of four.
20:02.760 - 20:05.520:  I learned that I was really good at chess,
20:05.520 - 20:08.720:  when I started bitching right down and going for tournaments.
20:08.720 - 20:12.300:  I want to be a professional chess player.
20:12.300 - 20:17.200:  And I also want to inspire young children and adults.
20:17.520 - 20:21.920:  Because it's not just about your own ambitions and your own capabilities.
20:21.920 - 20:27.520:  You're actually an ambassador for the gift of chess foundation, aren't you?
20:27.940 - 20:28.840:  What does that mean?
20:29.560 - 20:35.580:  I go to school of Unage and local communities to distribute the gift of chess.
20:36.040 - 20:37.980:  And I also teach you then how to play chess.
20:38.480 - 20:39.900:  It is not just the game.
20:40.520 - 20:43.980:  So what do you hope other people can take from chess,
20:44.000 - 20:47.080:  what they can learn from this game?
20:47.320 - 20:49.760:  Tell us how to have alternative plans.
20:49.820 - 20:55.280:  It helps you to see the big picture, to control your emotions, the act of think.
20:55.920 - 20:59.480:  We asked your dad what he made of all your success.
20:59.700 - 21:03.620:  And I hope you can hear this little clip that he gave us.
21:03.940 - 21:07.460:  I am proud of my daughter for her victories on the chess board
21:07.460 - 21:10.240:  and the person she has become through the journey of chess.
21:10.740 - 21:15.040:  She remains humble, kind, grounded, always willing to help and support others.
21:15.660 - 21:19.620:  As a father, I have learned that it is not just about winning trophies or accolades.
21:19.860 - 21:23.920:  It's about nurturing a chess passion and watching them shine uniquely.
21:24.520 - 21:28.920:  So what do your friends and other families say about what you're doing with chess?
21:29.340 - 21:30.820:  It is a chess is a good game.
21:31.620 - 21:34.280:  I should keep up playing and I should never give up.
21:35.100 - 21:38.260:  chess grandmaster in the making Ivia Irieto in Nigeria.
21:39.760 - 21:41.120:  How do you feel about watermelon?
21:41.140 - 21:45.680:  I'm betting you aren't as excited about it as the good people of Takizawa City in Japan.
21:45.780 - 21:50.540:  Thousands of people are descending on the city this month for the watermelon festival
21:50.980 - 21:55.880:  and spokesman Kenya Osawa with help from interpreter Catherine Nozawa explained why.
21:58.940 - 22:02.940:  So in order to increase the awareness of Takizawa watermelons,
22:03.160 - 22:08.200:  we created the festival and every year we continue to draw in more visitors.
22:08.200 - 22:16.040:  It has gotten so popular that now we have about 4,000 people visit and sell about 3,000 watermelons.
22:18.500 - 22:21.320:  Now the reason we became aware of your festival,
22:21.320 - 22:28.100:  we especially liked a photograph that we saw in the press of the Mayor Saturo Takeda
22:28.740 - 22:34.160:  wearing a very smart suit with a very serious expression on his face,
22:34.240 - 22:37.420:  but wearing a big foam melon hat.
22:40.240 - 22:41.540:  Is it fun, your festival?
22:43.920 - 22:47.940:  At the festival there are some events for people to enjoy.
22:48.380 - 22:55.340:  You can hear some music related to watermelon and also there's a watermelon splitting contest
22:55.900 - 22:56.520:  for children.
22:57.000 - 22:58.360:  Can you explain that for us?
23:00.220 - 23:06.720:  So first you put on a blindfold and then the watermelon is maybe about 5 meters away
23:07.540 - 23:14.760:  and you have to walk up to it and hit it with a stick and try and break open the watermelon.
23:14.760 - 23:22.240:  But this year at the festival they won't be using a real watermelon but a beach ball instead
23:22.580 - 23:29.700:  as part of like a environmental policy to not to waste any of the delicious watermelon.
23:30.680 - 23:32.540:  Very wise, very wise.
23:36.800 - 23:43.980:  So it sounds like at least initially the festival has been for farmers and people who want to
23:44.400 - 23:49.600:  buy watermelon, but you're talking to the world now, is this something you would like tourists
23:49.600 - 23:50.940:  to come and share in?
23:51.340 - 23:57.060:  We want everyone to be able to come and enjoy the watermelon in our city.
23:57.960 - 24:03.260:  Oh thanks to Kenya of Sawa and interpreter Catherine Nozawa and it all kicks off on August the
24:03.260 - 24:08.640:  11th in Takizawa City if you are in the neighborhood and if you know about an unusual festival,
24:09.140 - 24:10.760:  please get in touch, maybe invite us.
24:11.160 - 24:15.380:  Now we don't do a great deal of sport here, but it does make a lot of people very happy.
24:15.820 - 24:20.680:  As we record this edition, the women's football world cup is now into the group stages,
24:21.040 - 24:26.680:  making dreams come true for Sam and we can't let English cricketer stew at broad retire without
24:26.680 - 24:30.840:  a mention. Some of the newspaper headlines tell the story, fairy tale finish,
24:30.840 - 24:33.740:  way to go stew it and that's how you say goodbye.
24:33.740 - 24:39.560:  He ended in style bowling England to another dramatic victory in the fifth test against Australia
24:39.560 - 24:45.560:  to leave the Ashes Series level at 2-2. Another cricketing great Sachin Tendorka tweeted
24:45.560 - 24:51.480:  a phenomenal career draws to a close. Let's hear Stuart Broad's reaction to his last moments.
24:52.140 - 24:55.880:  It's always a really difficult decision to walk away from a game you love, but ultimately I wanted
24:56.760 - 25:01.340:  I wanted my last ball and my last back to be playing in an environment that's so special because
25:01.340 - 25:05.920:  my lasting memories will be just a pure joy and pure happiness and you know that's exactly
25:05.920 - 25:10.200:  how I feel right now. Stefan Schemelt, BBC Chief Cricket Writer, was watching.
25:10.560 - 25:16.780:  I think the funny thing about that moment was the anticipation that everyone had around it and
25:17.640 - 25:25.260:  the shared experience that everyone knew what was possible, but I guess the happiness in the moment
25:25.260 - 25:30.940:  from an England point of view was this perfect storm of England trying to draw the series
25:31.820 - 25:37.900:  and the knowledge that this great warrior Stuart Broad was bowing out to win the test match for
25:37.900 - 25:43.980:  England to bring this amazing series to a really dramatic and fitting finale. The stars really
25:43.980 - 25:51.660:  align for what was a really joyous moment. Looking more generally at sport, we experience,
25:51.660 - 25:58.140:  don't we, that the emotional heights and depths when we're watching it or participating in it.
25:58.440 - 26:05.880:  What is it about sport? It's a really unique thing, isn't it? In terms of a collective experience
26:06.880 - 26:18.640:  in that we all buy into the possibility of sharing together our joy or our despair or our anger
26:19.020 - 26:24.880:  or our disappointment and that is kind of the deal that you sign up to when you go to watch
26:24.980 - 26:30.680:  a sporting event and I suppose the only thing that I could compare it to is if you're watching
26:30.680 - 26:36.720:  a stand-up comedian on the TV at home, you might laugh out loud a couple of times, but if you're in
26:36.720 - 26:41.240:  the auditorium or you're in the theatre, you're much more likely to laugh out loud because everyone
26:41.240 - 26:46.320:  with you is laughing too and I think that's the thing with sport, isn't it, that when we're all
26:46.320 - 26:54.080:  together our emotions become heightened and the lows are lower and the highs are higher and you
26:54.080 - 26:58.580:  should never underestimate what the crowd does to a sporting event and when you have a moment of
26:58.580 - 27:04.640:  that pure joy like we had with Stuart Broad on Monday, what's perfect, isn't it? Yes it is, Stefan
27:04.640 - 27:13.640:  Schemelt, BBC Chief Cricket Writer. And that's it from us for now, remember if you'd like to be
27:13.640 - 27:18.160:  part of the happy point you can email us the sound that brings you joy, we would also love to hear
27:18.160 - 27:22.580:  if you have any stories to share that will make us all smile as ever, the address global podcast

27:50.020 - 27:56.760:  I was trying to understand why my friend from school time and other friends from our city were
27:56.760 - 28:05.280:  becoming jihadis she was in Syria. Six months pregnant you traveled to Syria in order to make a film
28:05.280 - 28:11.460:  about this friend of yours. Just a personal documentary about her radicalization.

28:43.400 - 28:48.340:  was for me totally unclear. Search for live's less ordinary wherever you get your podcasts.
