00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.460:  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.680 - 00:22.500:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Monday,
00:22.500 - 00:28.320:  the 21st of August. Saudi Arabia is accused of the systematic killing of Ethiopian migrants
00:28.320 - 00:42.440:  at the border with Yemen. The Israeli army is searching for a suspected Palestinian gunman
00:42.440 - 00:47.720:  who shot dead and Israeli women in the occupied West Bank, and the British serial killer nurse
00:47.720 - 00:51.840:  who murdered at least seven babies has been sentenced to life in prison.
00:54.140 - 01:01.340:  Also in the podcast, a return to the age of sale, the newly refurbished cargo ship using wind power.
01:05.440 - 01:10.500:  Every year tens of thousands of people attempt the perilous journey from the Horn of Africa to Yemen
01:10.500 - 01:16.540:  and then Saudi Arabia. Many do not make it. According to human rights watch hundreds of them,
01:16.540 - 01:22.740:  many Ethiopians have been gunned down by Saudi security forces on the border with Yemen.
01:22.740 - 01:28.340:  The human rights organization has documented evidence which suggests that the killings have been
01:28.340 - 01:34.760:  systematic. Saudi Arabia has denied the claims first made by UN experts last October.
01:35.440 - 01:40.160:  Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams has been hearing from migrants who tried to reach Saudi Arabia.
01:43.180 - 01:49.020:  On the steep rocky slopes of Yemen's northern mountains, migrants are on the move. Long lines of
01:49.020 - 01:54.640:  men and women, almost all of them Ethiopian, scrambling their way towards the nearby border with
01:54.640 - 02:01.400:  Saudi Arabia, escaping poverty and war at home in search of opportunity. But gunfire reverberates
02:01.400 - 02:05.680:  across the slopes and through the valleys, the journey ahead is fought with danger.
02:09.820 - 02:15.180:  We were shot in a bit at the Saudi border and those who shot us were Saudi men.
02:15.480 - 02:21.120:  They were Saudi Arabia's military uniform. A man we're calling Ibsa describes a terrifying
02:21.120 - 02:25.320:  night at the border. He's still in Yemen, so he doesn't want us to use his real name.
02:27.500 - 02:33.160:  They beat us, killed some, took those who survived to hospital. The bodies of those killed
02:33.160 - 02:38.600:  were left scattered on the ground. They were the only one who survived. They took me to a hospital
02:38.600 - 02:44.980:  where a bullet was taken out of my body. I was shot between my thighs, near my groin,
02:45.120 - 02:50.180:  and my legs are paralyzed now. I can't even walk. At that moment, I thought I would die.
02:51.040 - 02:56.020:  For two years, stories like this have become almost routine. The world, perhaps a little
02:56.020 - 03:02.220:  bored by Yemen's endless tales of war and famine, has somehow not taken much notice. That might
03:02.220 - 03:07.000:  be about to change. So a human rights watch what we documented are essentially mass killings.
03:07.140 - 03:12.280:  Nadia Hardman is the lead author of the report published today. Saudi border guards have fired
03:12.280 - 03:18.140:  explosive weapons and shot migrants and asylum seekers at close range on their international
03:18.140 - 03:23.220:  border with Yemen. The majority of people told me that their groups were women and children
03:23.220 - 03:29.400:  and described sites that sound like killing fields. And if there is a deliberate policy of murder,
03:29.400 - 03:35.000:  they would amount to a crime against humanity. Describe to us what kinds of things you have seen in
03:35.000 - 03:40.260:  these videos you've been collecting. The footage is horrifying. It really is. And mostly it's the
03:40.260 - 03:45.520:  guilt that people feel watching the people they've tried to cross with, die in front of them,
03:45.520 - 03:53.360:  and having to run away because they're running for their lives. Survivors of these horrors
03:53.360 - 03:58.820:  show deep signs of trauma. In Sunnah, Yemen's capital, a young woman we're calling Zahra can
03:58.820 - 04:03.280:  barely bring herself to speak about what happened at the border. Her journey through Yemen,
04:03.320 - 04:10.040:  which had already cost almost 2,000 pounds in ransoms and bribes to smugglers, ended in a hail
04:10.040 - 04:15.800:  of gunfire. One bullet took all the fingers of her right hand. Asked about the injury, she looks
04:15.800 - 04:22.000:  away and cannot answer. Some of those who don't make it across the border end up back where they
04:22.000 - 04:27.980:  started in Ethiopia. Mr. First Sufya Muhammad is one of them. At home now, still getting used to
04:27.980 - 04:36.140:  walking with a prosthetic left leg. He shows us a video taken just after he arrived in hospital
04:36.140 - 04:43.220:  in July last year. His foot has been severed. He's in agony. He says he was hit by some kind of rocket.
04:45.980 - 04:51.980:  We got shot at while we were walking. Immediately, we all lie down on the ground. I didn't even
04:51.980 - 04:57.900:  realize those shots. But when I tried to get up and walk, part of my leg wasn't there. The shooting
04:57.900 - 05:05.000:  went on and on and on. I hid behind a rock to save my life. I know its economic hardships that made me
05:05.000 - 05:10.620:  leave, but I do regret it. I always wonder why I made such a fit attempting to improve my life.
05:13.880 - 05:18.640:  Ethiopian migrants are still dying on the Saudi border. In a cemetery in the northern Yemeni
05:18.640 - 05:25.060:  city Asada, one was buried two weeks ago. Others with terrible injuries are being treated in local
05:25.060 - 05:30.940:  hospitals. Why these killings are taking place isn't clear. When allegations were first raised by
05:30.940 - 05:37.380:  the UN last year, the Saudi government denied that anything systematic was going on. It hasn't yet
05:37.380 - 05:45.960:  replied to us or to human rights watch. That report by Paul Adams. The West Bank is home to nearly
05:45.960 - 05:53.160:  three million Palestinians, but it's been occupied by Israel since the war of 1967. Nearly half
05:53.160 - 05:58.040:  a million Israelis now live there in settlements regarded as illegal under international law,
05:58.580 - 06:03.120:  but which are championed by some in Israel's hard right government. Tensions, which have been
06:03.120 - 06:08.400:  around for years, have spiked in recent months with a cycle of killings involving Palestinians,
06:08.400 - 06:13.360:  Jewish settlers and the Israeli army. The latest happened today, as I heard from our correspondent
06:13.360 - 06:19.560:  in Jerusalem, Tom Beidman. This latest incident was a drive-by shooting on the main north-south
06:19.560 - 06:25.560:  highway in the occupied West Bank Route 60. It seems to have happened close to the city of
06:25.760 - 06:30.320:  Hebron. It was close to the city of Hebron, but also close to several Israeli settlements
06:30.320 - 06:34.980:  that are outside the city. There's also Israeli settlements in the heart of Hebron,
06:35.800 - 06:42.400:  a very large Palestinian city as well. This car that was hit was being driven by a man who is
06:42.640 - 06:48.780:  badly wounded, and a 40-year-old woman was a passenger. She was killed. There was also a child
06:48.780 - 06:55.360:  in the car as well, conflicting reports about the age, but that child unharmed from the gun fire.
06:55.360 - 07:00.960:  What we now know is that this was a vehicle that apparently was later found burned out.
07:01.340 - 07:06.720:  The Israeli military has now closed off the entrances and exits of Hebron as searching
07:07.360 - 07:13.680:  Palestinians and clearly adding to the sense of tension there. As you say, comes at a time
07:13.680 - 07:19.860:  of rising bloodshed in the occupied West Bank once again to the third death of an Israeli
07:19.860 - 07:26.540:  in the last two days. After these very violent scenes of deadly Israeli military raids over
07:26.540 - 07:31.940:  the past 18 months, rising Palestinian gun attacks, and also we've seen rising numbers of
07:31.940 - 07:36.600:  rampages by Israeli settlers targeting Palestinian homes in the West Bank too.
07:36.920 - 07:40.420:  And does anyone have any idea of how to stop this cycle of violence?
07:41.920 - 07:46.420:  Well, the fundamental problem is that there is no realistic political horizon and there
07:46.420 - 07:51.900:  hasn't been for a very long time. And so, you know, just as a kind of signifier as to the sense
07:51.900 - 07:58.100:  of escalation, what we've seen after the recent killings of Israelis in the West Bank are
07:58.540 - 08:03.860:  settler social media groups, WhatsApp groups, telegram groups, calling for revenge. We've seen
08:03.860 - 08:10.500:  the far right calling for a far greater military response against Palestinians in the West Bank.
08:10.520 - 08:15.720:  And at the same time, Palestinian militant groups, for example, Hamas, saying that, you know,
08:15.720 - 08:21.500:  this is a result of Israel's occupation policies and also linking it as to what it sees as
08:21.500 - 08:27.300:  threat to Alexa Mosque in Jerusalem itself. So, at the moment, no sign of things abating.
08:27.660 - 08:33.680:  Tom Baiman in Jerusalem. Her crime has shocked Britain, the nurse who murdered at least seven
08:33.680 - 08:40.500:  babies in her care in hospital and tried to kill a further six. Lucy Letby is the most prolific
08:40.500 - 08:46.160:  serial child killer in Britain in modern times. For her sentencing, she refused to leave her
08:46.160 - 08:52.220:  cell to appear in the dock at Manchester Crown Court, but the judge, Justice Goss, addressed her
08:52.340 - 08:59.080:  as though she was there. You acted in a way that was completely contrary to the normal human
08:59.080 - 09:07.800:  instincts of nurturing and caring for babies and in gross breach of the trust that all citizens
09:08.520 - 09:15.800:  place in those who work in the medical and caring professions. The babies you harmed were
09:15.800 - 09:25.320:  born prematurely and some were at risk of not surviving. But in each case, you deliberately harmed
09:25.320 - 09:32.520:  them intending to kill them. Earlier, the families of her victims read out personal statements detailing
09:32.520 - 09:39.180:  the impact that her crimes had had on them then came the sentence. Because the seriousness of your
09:39.180 - 09:46.000:  offenses is exceptionally high, I direct that the early release provisions do not apply.
09:47.240 - 09:55.100:  The order of the court, therefore, is a whole life order on each and every offense and you will
09:55.100 - 10:01.020:  spend the rest of your life in prison. Our reporter Rowan Ridge spoke to Sarah Montague from
10:01.020 - 10:05.580:  Manchester Crown Court. Well, there was silence in court and some of the parents were crying as
10:05.580 - 10:11.780:  Mr Justice Goss delivered his comments. I think what's interesting is he gave 13 whole life orders.
10:11.780 - 10:17.460:  So, for each crime that Lucy Letby was convicted of, he handed her a whole life order.
10:17.900 - 10:23.620:  Each order means that she will spend the rest of her life in jail. But I think, he wanted to show
10:23.620 - 10:28.420:  the sheer seriousness with which he viewed these crimes that she has been given whole life orders
10:28.420 - 10:33.280:  for each of the crimes that she committed, each murder and attempted murder. He told her that the
10:33.280 - 10:38.520:  offenses were of very exceptional seriousness, that they were cruel, calculated, and cynical
10:38.520 - 10:43.420:  campaign of murder. But also that there was, as he put it, a deep malevolence, bordering on
10:43.420 - 10:48.500:  sadrism to what she'd done, that she'd shown no remorse, that there were no mitigating factors.
10:49.820 - 10:53.640:  And then he talked, he turned and spoke to the families involved and talked about how their
10:54.020 - 10:58.420:  behaviour and dignity has been of the highest, which I sincerely acknowledge with gratitude.
10:58.420 - 11:02.560:  And also thank the jurors for their role in a case, which they had to sit through
11:02.980 - 11:07.240:  nine grueling months of evidence and spent more than a month considering their verdicts before
11:07.240 - 11:13.340:  returning the guilty verdicts on Lucy Letby. Those 13 whole life orders mean she will only be the
11:13.340 - 11:18.340:  fourth woman in UK history to be told she'll never be released from prison. Others include people
11:18.360 - 11:21.220:  like Myra Hindley, Rose West and Joanna Denny.
11:22.340 - 11:27.380:  Rowan, I mean, it was an extraordinary morning in court this morning because of the victim impact
11:27.380 - 11:33.240:  statements, which from the sounds of it, what heard in silence by a very emotional court.
11:33.720 - 11:38.220:  Yes, I mean, I think it was an incredibly difficult and incredibly emotional time for everybody
11:38.220 - 11:43.240:  who was there. So there were family members of the babies who were in court, but also eight of
11:43.240 - 11:48.520:  the 11 jurors who sat through this trial, which has lasted more than 10 months, also came back
11:49.200 - 11:53.220:  to hear the family statements. And I think for those families, this really was there.
11:53.680 - 11:58.400:  The first time they've been able to personally talk about the impact of these events on them
11:58.400 - 12:03.480:  and their families, what it has meant to them to have their children murdered or for Lucy Letby
12:03.480 - 12:08.000:  to attempt to murder them. Some of them had spoken during the trial, but that was much more in a
12:08.000 - 12:12.940:  kind of factual evidence about what they saw and heard when Lucy Letby was around, but now they
12:12.940 - 12:17.800:  know for sure that their child was attacked by Lucy Letby and they've had to try and come to terms
12:17.800 - 12:22.140:  with that. And this was their chance to express exactly the impact that has had on them.
12:22.620 - 12:27.980:  Rowan Bridge at Manchester Crown Court. Many people around the world are facing higher
12:27.980 - 12:33.760:  costs as governments raise interest rates to try to combat inflation, but China has the opposite
12:33.760 - 12:39.420:  problem, falling prices and the specter of deflation. The world's second biggest economy is in
12:39.420 - 12:44.580:  trouble as its post-COVID recovery runs out of steam, the result of a property crisis falling
12:44.580 - 12:50.560:  exports and weak spending. In response, the communist authorities in Beijing have now cut a key
12:50.560 - 12:56.000:  interest rate for the second time in three months. So is China in trouble here? I asked
12:56.000 - 13:01.100:  our correspondent in Beijing, Steve McDonald. It's definitely in some very rough waters
13:01.800 - 13:08.540:  economically. I mean, people expected this country to bounce right back after zero COVID and all
13:08.540 - 13:13.200:  the restrictions we had here, but actually it's been pretty sluggish, youth unemployment,
13:13.200 - 13:19.320:  hovering at around 20 percent, property, bubble fears, household spending, down, local government
13:19.320 - 13:26.520:  debt. I mean, it's all pretty gloomy. And so what the government's done is to change one of
13:26.520 - 13:33.940:  its interest rates, the one-year benchmark lending rate by a sort of, it's only really a small
13:33.940 - 13:39.460:  tinkering, but didn't touch another key rate, a five-year rate. And what this seems to show is that
13:39.460 - 13:43.740:  they're worried about, they want some stimulus, but they actually don't want to pump the property
13:44.180 - 13:49.160:  market up a whole lot because part of the problem has been the overblown property market. And so
13:49.980 - 13:55.100:  they're just sort of slowly trying to get things going again. Yeah, I mean, the rest of the world
13:55.100 - 14:00.740:  had been pinning their hopes on China driving a global recovery after COVID. What does this
14:00.740 - 14:07.240:  lacklustre performance mean for everyone else? Well, I think you've got a situation now too,
14:07.240 - 14:13.060:  where China's kind of counting on the rest of the world funnily enough. And what they're hoping
14:13.840 - 14:19.820:  is that next year there will be a bigger global demand for all the stuff that China makes.
14:20.640 - 14:27.160:  And that this will lead to more exports and also more imports in China. And because of the size
14:27.160 - 14:32.160:  of the Chinese economy, that will then feed into all these other economies and sort of drive
14:32.160 - 14:38.300:  everybody along. But at the moment, you know, we've got this problem with deflation here.
14:39.300 - 14:45.300:  And it's partly because people are worried. There's just households aren't spending that much
14:45.300 - 14:49.960:  because they're just nervous about the future. Businesses aren't spending. And so they're
14:50.460 - 14:56.080:  making people's employment prospects more dodgy. And so then they're more nervous and spending
14:56.080 - 15:01.100:  given less and around and around you go. It's going to take a while to turn around, I think.
15:01.840 - 15:03.480:  Stephen McDonald in Beijing.
15:04.740 - 15:09.920:  Red S or relative energy deficiency is a condition which affects athletes all over the world,
15:09.920 - 15:15.400:  but it's one that's rarely discussed. In fact, sports governing bodies have been accused of
15:15.400 - 15:21.120:  sweeping it under the carpet. It tends to happen when competitors fail to properly refuel after
15:21.120 - 15:27.480:  strenuous exercise, and it can result in lifelong pain and disability. It is more prevalent in
15:27.480 - 15:32.200:  endurance events, but also affects sports like gymnastics and climbing. Our sports news
15:32.880 - 15:35.120:  correspondent Alex Kapstik has this report from Hungary.
15:35.980 - 15:42.380:  Commitment, determination, sacrifice. This August, welcome to Staling Buddha Mesh.
15:42.740 - 15:45.940:  World Championships brings the cream of track and feel together,
15:46.920 - 15:49.660:  but straining to become the best can come at a cost.
15:57.660 - 16:03.180:  Until a few years ago, the British distance runner Jake Smith was riding the crest of a wave.
16:03.180 - 16:07.240:  He was a winner with a big future. Then it all went wrong.
16:07.600 - 16:14.240:  September 2021, that's where it just got so bad. I was like 23 years old and I got
16:14.240 - 16:20.140:  down to 51 kilos, weighing myself every day, and I'd be happier if I was lighter. It was just nuts.
16:20.140 - 16:22.560:  So what was happening? We were just not eating very much.
16:22.760 - 16:25.980:  I say I'd burn it 4,500 calories. I wouldn't eat any more than 2000,
16:26.060 - 16:32.720:  because I was improving and getting lighter. I'd feel my body was unstoppable and then it just broke,
16:32.720 - 16:38.560:  like broke, broke, broken this whole last year. I've had two stretch ratchets. Every time I raced,
16:38.620 - 16:43.120:  I'd just kept getting ill and they said, you carry us on at the age of 30, you'll be in a wheelchair.
16:43.680 - 16:48.060:  Jake was eventually told he had red S, relative energy deficiency in sport.
16:48.060 - 16:53.220:  It's when athletes burn more calories than they take in. It was correctly diagnosed by
16:53.220 - 16:57.760:  Pippa Wolvin, another endurance runner who created a website to highlight the issue.
16:58.280 - 17:02.320:  She wants suffered from red S herself, although she didn't recognise the symptoms.
17:02.420 - 17:08.040:  They were very subtle at first. Things are often what you would expect from being a sportsperson,
17:08.040 - 17:13.000:  like illness and injury, and just the odd, coffin cold that takes a while to go away.
17:13.000 - 17:19.300:  But I was also suffering from menstrual dysfunction. I had lost my periods, but I didn't know that,
17:19.300 - 17:23.140:  because I was using the contraceptive pill. It was only when I came off the pill,
17:23.440 - 17:28.060:  and the periods never returned that I realised that might have been playing a part of the problem.
17:28.700 - 17:31.340:  And later down the line, I experienced a stress fracture in my foot.
17:31.340 - 17:36.740:  I was just so used to getting on with it and being a sportsperson and pushing through things.
17:36.740 - 17:41.500:  Pippa Wolvin's website has helped raise awareness, but she says it's not enough,
17:41.500 - 17:44.560:  and the sports authorities need to take it on.
17:44.840 - 17:48.340:  There is a long way to go, I think. There's a lot of health issues in sport that need tackling,
17:48.340 - 17:53.980:  and just like the concussion crisis, this will take time to reach a mass audience,
17:53.980 - 17:57.320:  but it definitely needs to start with governing bodies, in my opinion.
17:57.880 - 18:01.820:  But it is an issue that World Athletics for one says it's taking seriously.
18:01.820 - 18:06.460:  Here in Budapest, at the World Championships, it's a busy time for Dr Stefan Berman,
18:06.460 - 18:10.240:  the head of health and science for track and field's global governing body.
18:10.780 - 18:14.920:  He says they're trying to educate coaches and federations about Red S,
18:15.320 - 18:17.900:  but as he explains, it's a difficult process.
18:18.460 - 18:21.940:  Sometimes the athlete doesn't really know about his or her condition,
18:22.700 - 18:26.060:  and sometimes even if they know, they are still performing pretty well.
18:26.220 - 18:30.000:  So you're saying the danger is or the risk is that if an athlete is performing well,
18:30.400 - 18:34.900:  then coaches and federations don't want to get in the way of that.
18:35.320 - 18:39.680:  Absolutely, yeah. There is a time gap before you start to have Red S,
18:39.800 - 18:43.020:  and you start to experience, let's say, a stress fracture of the food.
18:43.540 - 18:46.240:  It can take six months, for instance, sometimes more.
18:46.660 - 18:49.100:  And within this period of time, you can achieve very good results.
18:49.100 - 18:52.640:  So why would you remove this female or male athlete from the competition?
18:53.420 - 18:55.460:  Red S affects a wide range of athletes.
18:56.020 - 18:58.060:  Sport climbing has recently denied allegations
18:58.060 - 19:00.940:  that it's been effectively turning a blind eye to the condition.
19:01.440 - 19:04.900:  Professor Volcker Schurler, lead physician for the German climbing team,
19:04.900 - 19:08.840:  is worried that unless more is done, Red S will continue to put at risk
19:09.120 - 19:10.820:  the long-term health of athletes.
19:11.340 - 19:13.860:  You see people out there who everybody thinks,
19:14.080 - 19:16.920:  well, that doesn't look very healthy. Are you sure she is?
19:17.460 - 19:18.800:  But then nothing is done about it.
19:19.140 - 19:24.680:  And the main problem is, what you see is a picture of a young skinny girl doing sports,
19:25.020 - 19:27.420:  where you think, okay, she's pretty skinny, that's it.
19:27.660 - 19:32.180:  But I see the long-term consequences because before these people sit in my office,
19:32.400 - 19:35.640:  they have two hyperplacements, they have another fatigue fracture on their feet,
19:35.700 - 19:38.420:  they're mentally messed up, they can't get pregnant,
19:38.920 - 19:40.340:  and their life is destroyed.
19:40.940 - 19:43.640:  It's a stark warning. Red S might be complex,
19:43.640 - 19:47.720:  and often difficult to diagnose, but its impact can be devastating.
19:48.360 - 19:51.560:  Alex Capstick at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest.
19:53.540 - 19:55.400:  Still to come on the global news podcast,
19:55.400 - 19:58.260:  the latest from California, where storm Hillary brought
19:58.260 - 20:01.360:  rental downpours to areas normally suffering drought.
20:01.900 - 20:03.980:  All that started within an hour or two,
20:04.400 - 20:09.120:  and then just kept piling up, and the water keeps coming further back up the street.
20:09.620 - 20:14.100:  And the novel approach to saving water being trialed by farmers in Tanzania.
20:21.040 - 20:22.920:  In the last episode of the global news podcast,
20:22.920 - 20:26.080:  we told you about Russia's attempt to land on the Moon,
20:26.080 - 20:32.460:  which ended in disaster after the craft spun out of control and crashed into the lunar surface on Sunday.
20:33.120 - 20:37.340:  All eyes are now on India, whose robotic probe, Chandarayan 3,
20:37.820 - 20:39.780:  is due to land in two days' time.
20:40.260 - 20:42.660:  Radio 4's Justin Webb spoke to Mahesh Anand,
20:42.660 - 20:46.400:  who's a professor of planetary science and exploration at the Open University.
20:47.140 - 20:51.020:  The Indian mission is not exactly trying to go to the same place, but in the same region.
20:51.280 - 20:56.160:  And the reason why the future missions are targeting the southern polar region of the Moon
20:56.160 - 20:59.300:  is because of the possibility of finding frozen water ice,
21:00.140 - 21:05.580:  which could be potentially a very useful resource for supporting future missions to the Moon,
21:05.580 - 21:08.640:  especially those that will carry humans there.
21:08.860 - 21:12.240:  So the Indian mission is particularly important now that the Russian one has obviously failed?
21:13.020 - 21:18.560:  Absolutely. I mean, these two missions were just going to be the first two of several
21:19.140 - 21:23.580:  that are planned for the southern polar region of the Moon in the next few years.
21:23.580 - 21:29.940:  In fact, if you look at the plans for various space agencies and various even commercial entities,
21:29.940 - 21:34.780:  there are probably more than 10 or 15 missions that are lined up to be launched in the next few years.
21:35.080 - 21:37.260:  There will be a lot of people who will be very pleased to see anything
21:37.260 - 21:40.460:  disastrous happening with Russians and rockets at the moment,
21:40.460 - 21:45.040:  given what's happening in Ukraine. But when you look at it from the point of view of the scientific
21:45.040 - 21:49.660:  community, I don't know whether you know any of the Russian scientists involved. I mean,
21:49.660 - 21:53.040:  is there a kind of still a fellow feeling or has that fallen away?
21:53.540 - 21:59.680:  As scientists, we are extremely sad to hear the unsuccessful nature of this mission,
22:00.160 - 22:04.520:  because whatever is happening here on Earth, there is still quite a lot of cooperation
22:04.520 - 22:09.580:  in space exploration. And we know that we are still collaborating with our Russian colleagues
22:09.580 - 22:15.900:  for getting astronauts to the International Space Station. So, nobody that I know is actually
22:15.900 - 22:21.760:  happy to hear this news. We were all looking forward to learning more about the lunar southern
22:21.760 - 22:26.880:  polar region, because we know hardly anything about the nature of the material makeup of that place
22:26.880 - 22:31.380:  and a place where one day, you know, humans might be actually operating and is paying,
22:31.380 - 22:33.680:  therefore, some considerable periods of time.
22:34.100 - 22:38.760:  Professor Mahesh Anand talking to Justin Webb. The shipping industry is one of the world's
22:38.760 - 22:43.780:  biggest carbon emitters, but a newly refurbished cargo vessel has just sent out on a voyage
22:43.780 - 22:48.620:  from China to Brazil, which could herald a return to wind power, at least in part.
22:48.620 - 22:54.200:  The five-year-old Pixis Ocean has been retrofitted with large wing-like sales,
22:54.300 - 22:58.840:  which aim to reduce the use of its engine. The sales were designed by the British company
22:58.840 - 23:02.860:  BAR Technologies. John Cooper is the chief executive.
23:03.400 - 23:07.880:  I do predict, as soon as 2025, half the new builds will be ordered with wind propulsion.
23:08.060 - 23:12.860:  The reason I'm so confident in that are savings. One and a half tons of fuel per day,
23:12.960 - 23:18.880:  so you get four wings on a vessel. That's six tons of fuel saved. That's 20 tons of CO2 saved
23:18.880 - 23:24.160:  per day. The numbers are massive. I heard more about the design from our technology reporter Tom
23:24.160 - 23:29.280:  Singleton. These are sales, but not perhaps in the sense that you or I or our listeners would
23:29.280 - 23:33.920:  necessarily picture them, not the sales that have blown vessels across the sea for millennia. These
23:33.920 - 23:40.020:  are in fact wind wings, so think about the wing of a large passenger jet. That's sort of size
23:40.020 - 23:44.980:  about 40 meters, and then in terms of construction, they're made of a similar material to wind turbine
23:44.980 - 23:49.100:  blades. That's to make sure they're robust and can stand up to the kind of high winds that you'll
23:49.100 - 23:53.740:  get out on the open sea. The way they work is that they fold down when the ship is in port,
23:53.740 - 23:57.440:  so they don't interfere with the cargo being loaded, and unloaded, then once the ship is at
23:57.440 - 24:01.500:  sale, in this case, as you mentioned, from China, where these wings were fitted, to Brazil,
24:01.500 - 24:05.500:  the ship's ultimate destination, they're folded out. They catch the wind just like sales have
24:05.500 - 24:10.460:  done since time immemorial and help as you say to push the ship across the sea, and the idea here
24:10.460 - 24:16.080:  is to save fuel exactly how much will depend on the wind conditions, and also I think it will
24:16.080 - 24:21.060:  depend on how this technology actually performs at sea. But as you heard there from John Cooper,
24:21.060 - 24:25.400:  the boss of the UK company that has developed these wings, they have very high hopes for their
24:25.400 - 24:30.700:  technology. Yeah, I mean, it could, if it works, make a big difference in reducing the amount of
24:30.860 - 24:36.460:  CO2 emitted by the shipping industry. Yes, that's certainly the hope. So, shipping is responsible
24:36.460 - 24:42.880:  for something like two to three percent of global CO2 emissions. That's equivalent to
24:42.880 - 24:47.260:  roughly speaking something like the output of Germany or Japan, so not an insignificant amount.
24:47.760 - 24:53.760:  So what we have within the shipping industry is a recognition that things need to change, but perhaps
24:53.760 - 24:59.180:  no clear idea exactly on how to do it. But I have a listen to John Deelman, he's the president
24:59.180 - 25:04.000:  of Cargill Ocean's Transportation Division. That's the company responsible for retrofitting
25:04.000 - 25:09.360:  the ship. Listen to how he describes how attitudes are changing within shipping. The narrative has
25:09.360 - 25:13.840:  changed completely, and everybody is really convinced that they need to do that part, and I can
25:13.840 - 25:18.500:  see that from a lot of angles. I think everybody here at the moment is a little bit struggling on
25:18.500 - 25:23.680:  how we're going to do this, and that's why we've taken the role in one of the larger players to
25:23.680 - 25:27.800:  just also underwrite some of the risk and trying out new things and really trying to move this
25:27.800 - 25:33.600:  industry forward. John Deelman from Cargill there, and Tom, are we really returning to an age
25:33.600 - 25:39.080:  of sale, but this time for these giant cargo ships? Well, yes, potentially. I mean, if you speak
25:39.080 - 25:43.640:  to shipping experts, they're clear that wind power is promising, but we also do need a little bit
25:43.640 - 25:48.940:  of perspective here. There's something like 110,000 ships of one sort or another out there in
25:48.940 - 25:53.920:  fewer than a hundred at the moment have any kind of wind-assisted technology, and people are also
25:53.920 - 25:57.780:  very clear that it's not going to work for every single ship. If you think about a container ship,
25:57.780 - 26:02.700:  for example, loaded high with containers, you couldn't fit these kind of wind wings onto them.
26:02.860 - 26:07.940:  So what people tell me is that in terms of decarbonising the shipping industry, there's lots of things
26:07.940 - 26:11.360:  that are going to be needed. We're going to need better ship design. We're going to crucially need
26:11.360 - 26:16.340:  biofuels that don't contribute towards climate change, but as one of the experts put it to me,
26:16.400 - 26:22.100:  this is such an important issue, and wind is potentially a useful contributor to decarbonising the
26:22.100 - 26:25.860:  shipping fleet that really, we have to throw everything at it is how they described it,
26:26.260 - 26:29.800:  and I think that's what we're starting to see here. Oh, technology reporter Tom Singleton.
26:30.540 - 26:35.220:  The U.S. state of California is normally more concerned about drought and wildfires rather
26:35.220 - 26:40.500:  than heavy rain, but on Sunday night it was hit by its worst tropical storm in decades.
26:40.540 - 26:46.420:  Storm Hillary dumped record rainfall on Los Angeles and even desert areas like Palm Springs and
26:46.420 - 26:51.600:  Death Valley. It has since been downgraded to a tropical depression, but there are reports of
26:51.600 - 26:57.420:  widespread damage and overwhelmed drainage systems. Kwan Feifar was one of the residents whose homes
26:57.420 - 27:03.280:  were threatened. If this road floods, there is no way in or out. All that started within an hour or two
27:03.720 - 27:08.420:  and then just kept piling up, up, and the water keeps coming further back up the street,
27:08.700 - 27:14.680:  and just more and more. It sucks to see it go, but lives can't be replaced, material objects can.
27:15.420 - 27:18.060:  And it's better to just replace the house, fix whatever gets damaged,
27:18.580 - 27:21.740:  than risking somebody drowning over something that's avoidable.
27:22.520 - 27:26.500:  Matthew Kabuchi is an atmospheric scientist and storm chaser from Palm Springs.
27:26.500 - 27:31.540:  Some folks are seeing close to a year's worth of rain in just like 24 to 36 hours.
27:31.540 - 27:37.080:  In Death Valley, California, for example, they average about 4.78 centimeters worth of rain per year.
27:37.580 - 27:41.980:  They've never seen more than about five or six centimeters in a given year,
27:41.980 - 27:46.280:  and yet they were forecast between five and 10 centimeters worth of rain when all was sudden done.
27:46.280 - 27:50.160:  And keep in mind, this is a desert landscape out here. There's a reason it's so dry.
27:50.160 - 27:54.540:  August is a dry season anyway. And so the sandy soils can't take in any of the moisture,
27:54.540 - 27:59.580:  so when you have a sudden 3, 4, 5 centimeters worth of rain, it accumulates with no place to go
27:59.580 - 28:04.240:  causing devastating flooding. A number of roads are impassable, and ultimately there have been water
28:04.240 - 28:07.500:  rescues. There have been people who, at least in Mexico, lost their lives or waiting to
28:07.500 - 28:12.540:  reports in parts of California. A Los Angeles suffered significant flooding as well,
28:12.540 - 28:17.220:  so a lot of major metro areas, especially with all that pavement, have been unable to see that
28:17.220 - 28:21.300:  water drain. Right now, things are winding down in Southern California, but Central California and
28:21.300 - 28:25.180:  the Great Basin of Nevada are next in line for the heavy rainfall. Then it's the Columbia River
28:25.180 - 28:29.720:  Basin, up towards parts of Idaho and even Eastern Oregon as well. One thing that I think is important,
28:29.720 - 28:33.420:  though, is a lot of folks didn't really know what they'd be facing. When you grow up in the desert,
28:33.420 - 28:38.480:  when you live here for 30, 40, 50 years, you don't see rain like this all that often. And I think
28:38.480 - 28:43.520:  a lot of folks oftentimes make the mistake of basing their actions, what they will do on past
28:43.520 - 28:47.340:  experience. The difficulty when you have an event that is sort of unprecedented or extremely
28:47.340 - 28:52.100:  rare like this is that people don't really have a basis of comparison. They can't really draw on
28:52.100 - 28:57.080:  prior experience because what they will experience is unlike anything that they have before. And so in
28:57.080 - 29:00.820:  this case, I think some folks were prepared, but I was really disappointed to see how many people
29:00.820 - 29:05.080:  were out driving looking around, rocking what was going on because the conditions were dangerous.
29:05.600 - 29:10.560:  Matthew Capucci talking to the BBC from Palm Springs. Communities around the world are
29:10.560 - 29:15.940:  increasingly looking for solutions to the problem of food shortages due to rapid climate change.
29:15.980 - 29:22.080:  In Tanzania, this includes adopting new methods of sustainable agriculture. The BBC's Egan
29:22.080 - 29:28.180:  Salah heard about one young farmer in the Arusha region using what's known as a grey water system
29:28.180 - 29:33.460:  to utilize wastewater. Have us all year round, summer to spring.
29:37.360 - 29:42.580:  It is this sewage collection system that changed the history of this young farmer.
29:46.740 - 29:51.560:  We have not alternative when the summer season arrives. So always during the summer season,
29:51.560 - 29:56.100:  you have to find that we stop the production of these vegetables and spices.
29:59.220 - 30:06.260:  Putting this idea into action took time and cost him money, but today he's happy with its result.
30:06.880 - 30:14.080:  Inside this well is a mixture of large and small stones, all of which are placed in a special order,
30:14.800 - 30:23.620:  so as to filter every drop of wastewater that enters here and ensure that it is used again for
30:23.620 - 30:32.060:  agriculture and breeding activities in this farm. There's more than grey water system that keeps
30:32.060 - 30:39.880:  the farm green. As you can see, this is our toilet too, but at the moment it is completely fall.
30:39.880 - 30:46.480:  We close it, we leave it for six months, all the excrement grows, rods and grows like soil,
30:46.480 - 30:52.320:  but there are also special insects that we breed here to digest and then they turn all the dirt
30:52.320 - 30:58.100:  into fertilizer. We send it to the farm and so on until the second hole comes to fill this
30:58.100 - 31:08.040:  while it is already growing because it takes time. Since he installed the system in his farm,
31:08.040 - 31:16.540:  his yield has increased from harvesting twice a year and now he has twice as much as he used to
31:16.540 - 31:24.540:  harvest before. From time to time fellow farmers from the neighborhood and even far away have been
31:24.540 - 31:31.080:  flooding his farm to land and some have already put this knowledge into practice.
31:31.080 - 31:37.000:  When we are told about irrigation, we believe that you must buy a big pump, go to the river,
31:37.400 - 31:41.240:  draw the water and irrigate your farm. No, there are many systems.
31:45.180 - 31:50.160:  If you have a farm and the area where people live on that farm, you can use the water they use
31:50.160 - 31:57.580:  to return it to agriculture, it grows better. Tanzania is the deputy minister of agriculture
31:57.580 - 32:03.540:  Anton Mavunde. Earlier this year said that the Tanzanian government intends to increase
32:03.540 - 32:08.640:  sales of produce to $2 billion per year by 2023.
