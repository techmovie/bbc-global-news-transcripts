00:28.580 - 00:31.980:  Betsy is held together by tape and their raccoons are being in the engine.
00:32.120 - 00:33.340:  It's a family car.
00:33.600 - 00:35.200:  Uh, there are flames on the hood.
00:35.400 - 00:36.540:  Bad custom paint job.

00:53.840 - 00:59.360:  I'm Charlotte Gallagher, and in the early hours of Wednesday,
00:59.360 - 01:02.420:  the 9th of August, these are our main stories.
01:03.020 - 01:06.840:  How can we protect the Amazon rainforest, South American leaders,
01:06.840 - 01:10.980:  try to find a solution at a landmark summit in Brazil?
01:10.980 - 01:16.040:  The Colombian drug cartel boss jailed for decades in the US,
01:16.760 - 01:21.060:  the mystery surrounding a fatal mushroom lunch in Australia.
01:21.080 - 01:22.980:  As case has definitely baffled police,
01:22.980 - 01:26.520:  it's confused and shocked the local community,
01:26.520 - 01:29.660:  and it's left this family absolutely devastated.
01:33.220 - 01:34.660:  Also in this podcast,
01:34.660 - 01:38.400:  how Portugal is battling raging wildfires.
01:38.840 - 01:43.180:  And we meet the person whose furry friend stole the show at this.
01:43.500 - 01:47.700:  The World Dog Surfing of Competition always draws a huge crowd up in North California.
01:47.700 - 01:51.000:  This year, I think there were close to a thousand people that came to the beach
01:51.000 - 01:52.880:  and watched all the dogs surf this year.
01:57.680 - 02:01.060:  But first, eight countries that share the Amazon rainforest
02:01.060 - 02:05.260:  have agreed to form an alliance to fight deforestation.
02:05.340 - 02:10.600:  Meeting in Brazil, they've promised to make sure the forest doesn't reach a tipping point
02:10.600 - 02:13.580:  when it would lose its ability to regenerate
02:13.580 - 02:17.980:  from the damage caused by droughts, fires, mining and tree logging.
02:18.540 - 02:19.820:  In his opening speech,
02:19.820 - 02:22.960:  the host, president Luis Anacio Lula de Silva,
02:23.440 - 02:27.140:  highlighted how crucial the world's biggest rainforest is
02:27.640 - 02:30.500:  in efforts to tackle the worsening climate crisis.
02:30.500 - 02:34.480:  Our South America correspondent Katie Watson reports from Brazil.
02:35.060 - 02:37.980:  It's a hefty declaration, some 10,000 words.
02:38.540 - 02:41.640:  And in it, the country said the objective was to prevent the Amazon
02:41.640 - 02:43.600:  from reaching a point of no return.
02:44.220 - 02:45.380:  It covers a lot of ground.
02:45.940 - 02:49.240:  And in it, the members agree it's important to draw up common goals
02:49.240 - 02:52.120:  such as combating deforestation by 2030
02:52.840 - 02:54.660:  and holding illegal mining and logging.
02:54.700 - 02:57.300:  But there was little detail on how will happen.
02:57.860 - 03:01.000:  While the declaration shows a commitment to tackling big issues together,
03:01.440 - 03:03.660:  there are differences in opinion in some areas.
03:04.200 - 03:05.980:  Colombia's president Gustavo Pedro
03:06.460 - 03:09.360:  wants all countries to work on banning new oil exploration,
03:09.860 - 03:12.680:  but Brazil is controversially wanting to explore new areas
03:13.040 - 03:14.380:  at the mouth of the Amazon River.
03:15.020 - 03:18.640:  Despite the differences, this summit has undoubtedly given this region a voice
03:18.640 - 03:20.520:  when it comes to combating climate change
03:20.520 - 03:22.680:  and the world is looking at South America
03:23.100 - 03:25.300:  to help come up with solutions in their own backyard.
03:25.980 - 03:27.500:  Katie Watson in Brazil.
03:27.880 - 03:32.200:  He was once one of the world's most dangerous drug lords.
03:32.400 - 03:35.940:  Now, Dario Antonio Asuga, known as Oteniel,
03:35.940 - 03:39.900:  has been sentenced to 45 years in jail in the U.S.
03:40.440 - 03:42.920:  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Rosha
03:42.920 - 03:44.940:  has been telling me more about him.
03:45.360 - 03:50.240:  He was the leader of the most powerful and dangerous criminal organization
03:50.500 - 03:52.220:  in Colombia for about a decade.
03:52.220 - 03:54.540:  The clandel golfer, the golf clan,
03:54.540 - 04:01.160:  he was running the organization since his brother was killed in a new year's party attack.
04:01.320 - 04:02.800:  And then eventually he took over.
04:03.100 - 04:06.900:  For several years, he was on the run going from safe house to safe house
04:06.900 - 04:09.640:  in the north of Colombia near border with Panama.
04:09.640 - 04:12.300:  There was a bounty on him, I think, $5 million.
04:12.380 - 04:16.360:  Eventually he was scott and extradited to the United States
04:16.360 - 04:19.940:  and the Colombian authorities agreed with the U.S.
04:19.980 - 04:21.860:  that he wouldn't be sentenced to life.
04:21.860 - 04:25.680:  But he was sentenced in New York to 45 years in jail,
04:25.680 - 04:29.440:  which is practically a life sentence if he serves that time
04:29.440 - 04:31.160:  because he's 51 years old.
04:31.680 - 04:35.280:  Why is he going to prison in the United States and not Colombia?
04:35.500 - 04:38.160:  That's something that changed in the 80s and the 90s
04:38.160 - 04:41.240:  when the U.S. did an agreement with Colombia
04:41.240 - 04:44.680:  to have this criminals extradited to the U.S.
04:44.840 - 04:46.160:  The reason is he's organized.
04:46.160 - 04:50.020:  It has been smuggling drugs cocaine mainly to the United States
04:50.020 - 04:53.700:  and generally the laundromani also in American banks.
04:53.700 - 04:55.340:  So that's an American offense.
04:55.620 - 05:00.500:  And for Colombian criminals and Mexican criminals also is the worst punishment
05:00.500 - 05:03.400:  that they can get because if they stayed in Colombia in prison,
05:03.400 - 05:04.600:  they have a lot of control.
05:04.600 - 05:06.080:  They can be close to the families.
05:06.080 - 05:09.540:  They often even manage to continue controlling the organizations.
05:09.620 - 05:12.320:  But going to the U.S., they lose their nobodies there.
05:12.320 - 05:14.800:  They try it all course to avoid extradition.
05:15.400 - 05:17.520:  His lawyer's asking for more lenient sentence.
05:17.760 - 05:19.700:  I mean, can you see any chance of that?
05:20.000 - 05:22.640:  I can see a possibility of her.
05:22.640 - 05:25.320:  But there's no sympathy for him.
05:25.380 - 05:28.760:  The prosecutors describe the Tonella's vicious character,
05:28.760 - 05:31.280:  vindictive that he killed his opponents
05:31.280 - 05:34.200:  and people who were seen as collaborating with the police.
05:34.200 - 05:39.200:  What his lawyer said is that he was forced to join a paramilitary rebel group
05:39.200 - 05:40.820:  when he was a young child,
05:40.820 - 05:44.040:  that he didn't choose this life that they should consider that.
05:44.200 - 05:47.260:  But I don't think the American authorities or people in Colombia
05:47.260 - 05:48.860:  will have much sympathy for him.
05:49.420 - 05:52.040:  But that's the problem with the region and everywhere.
05:52.040 - 05:56.880:  There won't be a direct impact on the production of cocaine or smuggling.
05:56.880 - 05:58.900:  Other people will control his areas.
05:59.660 - 06:02.460:  That was Leonardo, Russia, now to Portugal.
06:06.240 - 06:11.680:  That's the sound of the wildfires which are raging in central and southern Portugal.
06:12.200 - 06:15.640:  The latest European country to battle with the problem this summer.
06:16.100 - 06:20.360:  Nearly 3,000 firefighters spent Tuesday tackling fires
06:20.500 - 06:21.640:  throughout central Portugal.
06:22.160 - 06:25.460:  Officials say they're particularly concerned about two areas
06:25.460 - 06:27.920:  where the fires could start spreading again.
06:27.940 - 06:33.920:  Hundreds of people have been evacuated from villages, campsites and tourist resorts.
06:34.640 - 06:36.740:  Alistair Leephead is a journalist there.
06:37.100 - 06:38.920:  I can hear the constant buzz of the aircraft
06:38.920 - 06:42.960:  that are doing trips from the nearby reservoir to the side of the fire
06:42.960 - 06:44.840:  that's just over the hill behind me.
06:44.880 - 06:46.820:  It's about three or four kilometres from where we are.
06:47.240 - 06:50.580:  This was a fire that started a day when rarely we have these east winds
06:50.900 - 06:52.660:  and it was a top of us in no time at all.
06:52.920 - 06:55.960:  We had an hour to pack the car with all the things we wanted to save from the house
06:56.580 - 06:58.560:  and then we had to get out before we were cut off by the fire.
06:58.780 - 07:00.800:  All of the hillsides here were burned
07:00.840 - 07:03.840:  but we have a lot of cork oak and cork oaks are designed for fire
07:04.140 - 07:05.480:  so they've all recovered quite well.
07:05.640 - 07:08.500:  Part of our house was burnt, but again it was just the outside.
07:08.500 - 07:12.880:  Unlucky that the fire came to our valley but very lucky that more damage wasn't done.
07:13.140 - 07:15.920:  We know there have been around 1400 people evacuated from homes.
07:15.920 - 07:20.920:  There have been some houses and resorts that have been destroyed south of Saudi Atonio.
07:20.920 - 07:23.740:  It's fire when it's dry from here, it's just over the hill.
07:24.020 - 07:26.320:  And the fire was on the edge of that town yesterday.
07:26.320 - 07:29.920:  People were getting very nervous when you can't see the sun for smoke
07:29.920 - 07:32.920:  in the town center and although today things have gone well,
07:32.920 - 07:35.640:  the weather can change, the winds can change very quickly here
07:35.760 - 07:38.220:  and then we could be in a very difficult situation once again.
07:38.360 - 07:40.920:  Where we are here on the coast, it's a bit cooler.
07:40.920 - 07:42.280:  This is why it's more unusual.
07:42.720 - 07:45.760:  The bigger fires are usually up in the mountains close to the Spanish border.
07:46.040 - 07:48.520:  There was one there last week which was huge but was then controlled.
07:48.520 - 07:52.180:  I spoke this morning actually to the nearby vineyard here
07:52.480 - 07:56.380:  and 45 of their staff fought the fire as it was coming out them yesterday.
07:56.420 - 07:59.820:  We honestly thought that they would have lost their harvest and their new winery.
07:59.900 - 08:03.480:  But they went out with water trucks, plows to plow land
08:03.480 - 08:06.320:  between where the fire is coming from and going to.
08:06.320 - 08:08.920:  That happened to us. Our local farmer came with his son
08:08.920 - 08:12.380:  and cut big swathes of land to try and stop the flames.
08:12.440 - 08:16.440:  The problem is that in the wind and the eucalyptus trees have this oil that burns.
08:16.440 - 08:21.000:  They can spark balls of fire that can be sent 100-200 meters
08:21.480 - 08:24.140:  and if someone's not there to see them and to put them out quickly,
08:24.140 - 08:27.380:  another fire begins. That's why these fires can be so dangerous,
08:27.380 - 08:28.520:  especially with high winds.
08:29.340 - 08:34.120:  Alice Leithead. When the Taliban swept into power two years ago,
08:34.120 - 08:38.920:  there was much talk of whether they might be different from their previous incarnation,
08:38.960 - 08:42.740:  whether in particular women's rights might survive.
08:42.940 - 08:47.800:  The simple answer is no and the dismantling of secondary and university education
08:47.940 - 08:49.640:  for women is now complete.
08:50.420 - 08:55.720:  But out of sight of the authorities, teachers and academics have pushed back
08:56.180 - 08:59.400:  as Sana Safi from the BBC's Afghan service reports,
09:00.040 - 09:03.980:  women and girls are now being educated in a network of secret schools.
09:05.940 - 09:12.160:  Teachers here say that even if the Taliban suspects one girl of being a school student,
09:12.620 - 09:16.000:  then the future of thousands of girls will be in danger.
09:16.880 - 09:20.440:  I feel like I'm stealing on education. I'm stealing life.
09:21.100 - 09:23.360:  The voice you have just heard belongs to an actor.
09:24.020 - 09:28.220:  But the words are those of a young woman who attends a secret school in Afghanistan.
09:29.100 - 09:32.720:  For her own safety, we can't reveal her name or location.
09:33.460 - 09:36.260:  I'm the first journalist to be given access to her class,
09:36.780 - 09:41.340:  made up of more than 30 female students aged between 12 and 22.
09:42.180 - 09:46.520:  I was able to observe from outside to the country using a live video link.
09:46.940 - 09:52.120:  It's a class full of young women and young woman is showing me her books.
09:53.240 - 09:54.760:  It's biology, yes.
09:55.940 - 09:59.820:  So a teacher had just come closer to the camera to speak with us.
10:00.480 - 10:01.500:  We're going to call her H.
10:03.060 - 10:06.500:  They have told us to come secretly on secret roads.
10:07.280 - 10:08.980:  Students come from different ways.
10:09.500 - 10:11.660:  So Taliban won't see that they are coming here.
10:12.200 - 10:16.280:  They must wear good hijabs and feels like we are nothing in the society.
10:17.200 - 10:18.400:  It even makes me cry.
10:18.800 - 10:20.940:  Why can't we girls go to school like men?
10:21.300 - 10:26.540:  This secret school is one of three run by women's rights activist, Pashna Durani.
10:26.760 - 10:29.440:  If I didn't have my education, I would be married off.
10:29.480 - 10:30.620:  My sister would be married off.
10:30.940 - 10:33.180:  My brother would be working as a child labor somewhere,
10:33.940 - 10:36.420:  and I would be the act that was needed because of my education,
10:36.940 - 10:39.460:  because of that power that I had over my destiny.
10:39.940 - 10:44.080:  Pashna moved to the US after receiving what she says were serious threats.
10:44.940 - 10:48.180:  But when we speak, she's back in Afghanistan, in hiding,
10:49.000 - 10:50.960:  and increasingly worried about her safety,
10:51.940 - 10:53.340:  and that of her students and teachers.
10:53.940 - 10:54.960:  The effort will continue.
10:55.940 - 10:56.380:  A lot of people believe in it,
10:57.940 - 11:00.580:  and they want a better lifestyle for their children, especially young girls.
11:05.180 - 11:07.380:  When the Taliban banned music,
11:08.000 - 11:11.300:  I created several music classes.
11:12.260 - 11:17.020:  It was like fighting against behavior of the Taliban.
11:17.760 - 11:22.600:  That's Angela Royour, founder of an alternative option for Afghan women and girls.
11:23.380 - 11:25.660:  She and a team of teachers from across the globe
11:25.660 - 11:30.720:  deliver 85 different online classes to students inside Afghanistan,
11:31.620 - 11:33.640:  ranging from English to the sciences.
11:34.400 - 11:36.520:  Some of the classes are pre-recorded,
11:36.940 - 11:39.840:  but others are real-time, interactive lessons,
11:39.920 - 11:42.680:  delivered via messaging platforms and apps.
11:43.440 - 11:48.380:  The classes are very popular, even though Angela says she can't issue qualifications.
11:49.200 - 11:49.900:  We could hear you.
11:50.140 - 11:50.860:  Oh, sorry.
11:51.260 - 11:52.880:  I sit in on a virtual class.
11:53.400 - 11:55.040:  Today's subject, the future.
11:55.480 - 11:56.720:  I can't see the pupils.
11:57.340 - 12:00.780:  They're logged on to a messaging app, installed on all of their phones,
12:01.480 - 12:04.240:  and can either talk to me directly or post comments.
12:05.040 - 12:07.080:  Yes, I want to speak again,
12:07.540 - 12:09.380:  an actor is saying this student's words.
12:10.220 - 12:13.020:  But by the way, she spoke to me in flawless English.
12:13.900 - 12:17.420:  Well, my ultimate dream is to become a diplomat
12:17.440 - 12:20.600:  and represent my country on a global stage.
12:21.320 - 12:23.760:  And it feels like I'm fighting an uphill battle.
12:24.120 - 12:27.560:  I'm trapped in a society where education is forbidden.
12:28.240 - 12:29.820:  Freedom is a decent memory.
12:30.480 - 12:33.980:  And I hold on to the belief that one day things will change.
12:33.980 - 12:37.840:  That one day I'll be able to go to school without fear.
12:38.380 - 12:40.640:  That report was by Sana Safi.
12:41.300 - 12:45.200:  Two Saturdays ago, 48-year-old Australian Aaron Patterson
12:45.360 - 12:47.460:  cooked lunch so far, so normal.
12:47.940 - 12:50.020:  But now, three of her guests are dead
12:50.340 - 12:52.440:  and a fourth is fighting for his life.
12:53.080 - 12:54.560:  The story has gone global,
12:54.860 - 12:56.720:  partly because so many are baffled
12:56.720 - 12:58.460:  as to why Aaron Patterson,
12:58.640 - 13:00.260:  the host of the party is fine,
13:00.820 - 13:02.020:  and so are her children.
13:02.400 - 13:03.240:  So what's happened?
13:03.820 - 13:05.900:  Our reporter Tiffany Turnbull in Sydney
13:05.900 - 13:08.280:  told my colleague Anita Annand more.
13:08.620 - 13:11.480:  It was a family of around five people that met.
13:11.480 - 13:14.360:  It was hosted at this moment called Aaron Patterson's home.
13:14.620 - 13:16.640:  She invited her in-laws
13:17.120 - 13:19.760:  and her mother-in-law's sister and her husband as well.
13:19.880 - 13:22.920:  The guests at her home very quickly became sick
13:23.040 - 13:24.500:  within hours of eating there
13:24.900 - 13:26.380:  and they took themselves to hospital.
13:26.380 - 13:28.540:  They thought they were sick with food poisoning
13:28.540 - 13:30.980:  but it soon turned out that it was a lot worse than that.
13:31.120 - 13:33.140:  They were getting the best medical care,
13:33.180 - 13:35.640:  but despite that, three of them have since died
13:35.760 - 13:37.340:  and another one is critically ill.
13:37.540 - 13:40.180:  But weirdly, Aaron is completely fine.
13:40.260 - 13:41.220:  As are her kids,
13:41.220 - 13:43.300:  they're believed to have eaten something different,
13:44.000 - 13:46.000:  but this case has definitely baffled police.
13:46.000 - 13:49.540:  It's confused and shocked the local community
13:49.540 - 13:52.660:  and it's left this family absolutely devastated.
13:53.020 - 13:55.620:  At what point did they realise the mushrooms were to blame
13:55.620 - 13:57.240:  and where did these mushrooms come from?
13:57.500 - 14:00.200:  Police are still 100% trying to confirm
14:00.480 - 14:03.560:  that these mushrooms were behind these symptoms,
14:04.200 - 14:05.660:  but they say that they're pretty confident
14:05.660 - 14:07.420:  it was something called a death cat mushroom.
14:07.740 - 14:09.740:  These mushrooms are found all over the world
14:09.960 - 14:11.900:  in cool and humid climates.
14:11.900 - 14:13.400:  They just look like normal mushrooms.
14:13.560 - 14:15.820:  There's nothing really that stands out that you go,
14:15.820 - 14:17.400:  hey, that one's really poisonous.
14:17.740 - 14:21.580:  And so people have and do regularly around the world
14:21.580 - 14:24.260:  accidentally eat these and become very ill.
14:24.440 - 14:26.920:  Some of the symptoms are actually quite similar
14:26.980 - 14:27.840:  to food poisoning,
14:27.840 - 14:30.920:  which is why sometimes can be really hard to detect
14:31.260 - 14:32.680:  until people are really ill.
14:32.860 - 14:35.220:  But we also know that they're so poisonous
14:35.220 - 14:37.520:  that just a piece the size of a coin
14:37.520 - 14:39.120:  is enough to kill an adult.
14:39.420 - 14:41.920:  But as for where these specific mushrooms came from,
14:41.920 - 14:43.880:  police don't actually know that yet either.
14:44.280 - 14:46.760:  And Aaron, the woman who cooked the meal,
14:46.920 - 14:47.620:  has been asked that,
14:47.660 - 14:49.660:  but she's declined to answer those questions.
14:50.080 - 14:52.060:  What was the mushrooms roll in the meal itself?
14:52.360 - 14:53.860:  We actually don't know that either.
14:54.160 - 14:57.420:  Police say that they have an idea of what dishes were served,
14:57.420 - 14:59.700:  but they're still working out what was served to who,
14:59.940 - 15:03.580:  and they haven't exactly told us what this meal looked like.
15:03.860 - 15:06.740:  Definitely not the first time that we've seen
15:06.740 - 15:09.520:  death cat poisonings here in Australia,
15:09.520 - 15:12.700:  but police say this is actually quite an unusual case.
15:12.800 - 15:14.740:  They haven't really seen multiple members
15:14.740 - 15:17.500:  of the one family full ill like this before,
15:17.840 - 15:19.340:  and because that is so unusual,
15:19.340 - 15:21.720:  that's why there's bored in the homicide squad.
15:21.720 - 15:23.220:  That was Tiffany Turnbull.
15:23.840 - 15:26.840:  DJ Casper, the creator of the Worldwide Hit,
15:26.840 - 15:30.260:  the Chacha Slide, has died at the age of 58.
15:30.600 - 15:33.180:  He'd been suffering from cancer for seven years.
15:33.920 - 15:34.940:  Phoebe Hobson reports.
15:39.060 - 15:41.880:  The song with Chacha Slide, with its easy-to-follow dance moves,
15:41.960 - 15:43.820:  was a soundtrack to school disco's weddings
15:43.820 - 15:45.260:  and parties across the world.
15:45.900 - 15:48.820:  Its universal appeal to get people moving on the dance floor
15:49.140 - 15:52.900:  is perhaps unsurprising, as DJ Casper originally created it
15:53.160 - 15:55.340:  as a musical exercise routine for his nephew,
15:55.340 - 15:56.600:  who was a personal trainer.
15:58.240 - 16:01.280:  Its popularity grew in his native Chicago in the late 90s,
16:01.480 - 16:04.240:  before making its way to Europe in the early 2000s.
16:04.540 - 16:08.060:  The song even had an appearance in the hit series Orange is the New Black.
16:08.420 - 16:09.400:  What happened this time?
16:09.820 - 16:11.720:  Many tributes from fans on social media
16:12.140 - 16:13.700:  mention how the dance moves were loved
16:13.700 - 16:15.860:  by all generations at family parties.
16:16.640 - 16:19.780:  Speaking about his own hit, DJ Casper said its legacy
16:19.820 - 16:22.300:  was to unify people with a positive message.
16:28.940 - 16:30.560:  That was Phoebe Hobson reporting.
16:33.880 - 16:35.920:  Still to come on the Global News podcast,
16:35.960 - 16:40.920:  why China's economic woes are forcing some people to do this?
16:41.580 - 16:43.260:  The idea is that they would share room
16:43.400 - 16:46.700:  and bid to cut costs, particularly for young workers
16:47.020 - 16:48.160:  and recent graduates.
16:55.540 - 16:58.280:  Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan
16:58.280 - 17:01.940:  has been barred from holding public office for five years.
17:02.600 - 17:04.760:  The ruining by the country's electoral authorities
17:04.760 - 17:07.320:  means he'll be dismissed as an MP
17:07.520 - 17:10.500:  and will be disqualified altogether from politics.
17:11.200 - 17:13.920:  This comes after Mr Khan was sentenced to three years
17:13.920 - 17:16.520:  in prison for corruption, which he denies.
17:16.920 - 17:18.480:  Our correspondent Caroline Davis
17:18.480 - 17:20.780:  is in the Pakistani capital Islamabad.
17:21.240 - 17:23.920:  I think what his supporters and lawyers held up hope for
17:24.520 - 17:25.920:  was in the course of the next few days
17:26.460 - 17:28.840:  that they might be able to delay this whole process.
17:29.160 - 17:30.740:  It wasn't entirely clear how quickly
17:30.740 - 17:32.400:  the Electoral Commission would move
17:32.820 - 17:34.220:  to disqualify him altogether.
17:34.700 - 17:36.780:  But the fact is that within just a few days
17:36.780 - 17:38.300:  they have moved to disqualify him.
17:38.580 - 17:39.920:  We now know that for five years
17:39.920 - 17:41.660:  he will not be able to hold public office
17:42.080 - 17:44.900:  and he will not be able to lead his party,
17:44.900 - 17:47.460:  the PTI party, which leaves a lot of questions.
17:47.900 - 17:50.800:  Firstly, the expectation is that there is a general election
17:51.360 - 17:53.420:  expected this year by the constitution
17:53.500 - 17:55.580:  it needs to be by early November.
17:55.960 - 17:58.920:  And of course, if Imran Khan is not leading his party,
17:58.920 - 18:00.400:  he has founded his party.
18:00.400 - 18:03.460:  The emblem of the PTI is a cricket bat.
18:03.760 - 18:06.240:  So the fact that he is not there leading his party
18:06.740 - 18:10.080:  really does mean that the major government opposition
18:10.540 - 18:13.560:  will not be standing in a very meaningful way unless
18:14.100 - 18:15.560:  someone else is able to take the reins
18:15.560 - 18:16.880:  and give it in a different direction.
18:17.440 - 18:19.540:  This is probably one of the last parts of hope
18:19.540 - 18:22.560:  that maybe Imran Khan, his lawyers, his supporters,
18:22.560 - 18:24.980:  had was that they might be able to create some form of delay.
18:25.340 - 18:26.860:  But the fact that he's now been disqualified
18:26.940 - 18:29.580:  really means that this is a very big uphill struggle
18:29.940 - 18:31.600:  if Imran Khan is going to find anyway
18:31.940 - 18:33.300:  to be able to contest the elections.
18:33.820 - 18:35.740:  Caroline Davis in Islamabad.
18:36.400 - 18:38.860:  Georgia has become a prime destination
18:39.120 - 18:41.480:  for Russians fleeing the war with Ukraine.
18:42.260 - 18:45.900:  But a past Russian invasion means many Georgians
18:46.000 - 18:47.760:  are not happy to see them.
18:48.280 - 18:49.520:  Now, the government of Georgia,
18:49.520 - 18:53.560:  although often accused by critics of having pro-Kremlin leanings,
18:53.920 - 18:55.920:  has called Russia an aggressor,
18:56.320 - 18:58.680:  saying Moscow's continuing occupation
18:58.680 - 19:02.340:  of a section of Georgia is a key challenge to its development.
19:03.180 - 19:04.920:  Our correspondent, Vitaly Chevchenko,
19:04.920 - 19:08.340:  has just returned from the Georgian capital to Bliisi
19:08.740 - 19:10.720:  and told us more about the tensions.
19:11.460 - 19:14.520:  Thousands of Russians currently in Georgia,
19:14.900 - 19:18.760:  most of them are trying to escape the military draft.
19:18.760 - 19:21.460:  They don't want to be sent by the Russian government
19:21.460 - 19:24.640:  to fight in Ukraine, kill or be killed.
19:24.640 - 19:29.920:  There's an extraordinary amount of extreme anti-Russian
19:29.920 - 19:33.280:  graffiti scrawled all over Bliisi.
19:33.640 - 19:34.560:  And it is crude.
19:34.840 - 19:35.480:  Kill Russians.
19:35.480 - 19:39.460:  Russians not welcome here, good or bad.
19:39.560 - 19:43.880:  Now, in wartime language, good Russians are the ones
19:43.940 - 19:47.840:  that do not support President Putin's special military preparation
19:48.040 - 19:48.620:  in Ukraine.
19:48.620 - 19:51.800:  It was really difficult to escape the Russia Ukraine war.
19:52.060 - 19:56.120:  Reminders of it are to be found in the most unusual of places,
19:56.460 - 19:58.120:  such as restaurants and bars.
19:58.120 - 20:01.280:  In one of them, I saw leaflets in Russian,
20:01.280 - 20:03.560:  addressed to Russians, which said,
20:03.560 - 20:07.600:  every single Russian bears responsibility for this war.
20:07.940 - 20:09.400:  While you're having fun here,
20:09.400 - 20:13.440:  you're army, pillaging, killing, and raping in Ukraine.
20:13.440 - 20:16.380:  So, if you couldn't protest against this in Russia,
20:16.820 - 20:17.460:  do it here.
20:17.460 - 20:19.600:  If you don't agree with it, you're not welcome.
20:19.760 - 20:24.040:  There are, of course, valid reasons for Georgians to be critical
20:24.040 - 20:28.160:  of relations with Russia, because exactly 15 years ago,
20:28.620 - 20:30.700:  a war started between Russia and Georgia,
20:31.000 - 20:35.660:  as a result of which Georgia lost roughly 20% of its territory.
20:36.060 - 20:39.840:  So, there's a troubled past between Russia and Georgia,
20:39.840 - 20:43.680:  and it's still haunting relations between these two countries.
20:44.020 - 20:47.560:  Did you speak to any Russians that had moved there when you were in Bliisi?
20:47.760 - 20:52.920:  My friends who moved to Georgia from Russia after the start of this war
20:53.220 - 20:55.560:  and people who grew up in Bliisi,
20:55.760 - 21:02.340:  they held this point of view that a lot of the Russians who are now in Georgia,
21:02.840 - 21:05.740:  they seemed reluctant to confront,
21:05.960 - 21:08.640:  the reasons why they had to leave their home country.
21:09.020 - 21:10.740:  In one example, there was given us,
21:10.780 - 21:16.560:  well, look at the restaurants that are always full of Russians who are whining and dining,
21:16.560 - 21:21.800:  and look at how many of them are protesting against this war.
21:21.980 - 21:25.800:  It has to be said that such protests are very few and far between.
21:25.800 - 21:30.300:  The rifts are deep between the new arrivals from Russia and local residents,
21:30.420 - 21:38.140:  and one local opinion poll found that 78% of Georgians object to Russians
21:38.140 - 21:42.180:  not having to apply for a visa to visit Georgia.
21:42.180 - 21:47.260:  They object to Russians in opening businesses in Georgia buying property in Georgia
21:47.660 - 21:53.280:  and only 4% say that Russians are very welcome in Georgia.
21:53.700 - 21:57.500:  Vitaly Chevchenko, once dubbed the roaring dragon
21:57.500 - 22:00.180:  because of its enviable economic growth,
22:00.340 - 22:02.400:  the Chinese economy is faltering.
22:02.920 - 22:08.580:  In our previous podcast, we reported on exports plummeting by almost 15%.
22:09.040 - 22:13.480:  That's threatening its economic recovery following the world's longest Covid lockdown,
22:14.080 - 22:16.580:  and it's having a big impact on China's youth,
22:16.720 - 22:19.860:  with growing numbers struggling to find a job and make a living.
22:20.580 - 22:25.500:  Some are reportedly having to share beds with people they don't even know,
22:25.980 - 22:28.520:  in order to be able to afford to live in big cities.
22:29.100 - 22:32.180:  The BBC's Katie Silver in our Singapore Bureau explains.
22:32.960 - 22:34.400:  It's really quite something.
22:34.400 - 22:36.720:  It was originally reported by South China Morning Post.
22:36.800 - 22:38.640:  It's been spotted on Chinese social media,
22:38.820 - 22:44.220:  and there's even a hashtag that people are using to search for possible bedmates as the term is called.
22:44.520 - 22:47.660:  The idea is that they would share room and bed to cut costs,
22:47.700 - 22:51.100:  particularly for young workers and recent graduates.
22:51.100 - 22:57.220:  A survey in China recently found that most young people want to pay rent only up to about 30% of their salary,
22:57.480 - 23:01.580:  and given that the recent graduate earns about $1,400 USD a month,
23:01.680 - 23:05.640:  it's far less than they would need to be able to achieve that 30% figure
23:05.640 - 23:07.780:  or to have any hope of having any savings.
23:07.780 - 23:10.920:  As part of this, many have rules, for example, no storing,
23:10.920 - 23:13.460:  and no inviting romantic guests.
23:13.720 - 23:17.920:  It does seem indeed to be something as a way of countering the huge issue that China has
23:17.920 - 23:19.340:  when it comes to youth unemployment.
23:19.640 - 23:21.340:  To give you an idea last month in June,
23:21.340 - 23:25.900:  it hit a record 21%, and that's doubled in the last four years.
23:25.900 - 23:27.680:  The pandemic did nothing to help.
23:27.860 - 23:29.280:  There were layoffs without compensation,
23:29.500 - 23:32.780:  and of course we saw the China's tech industry really struggling,
23:32.780 - 23:38.180:  and tech has definitely been an area that has obviously attracted a lot of young recent graduates.
23:38.440 - 23:40.840:  That number, that 21% figure is expected to get even worse,
23:40.840 - 23:43.560:  more students graduating, turning into job seekers,
23:43.840 - 23:47.920:  and we're hearing that college graduates now are being told not to be too lofty,
23:47.920 - 23:50.860:  don't aim for the top, just take opportunities that you can,
23:51.140 - 23:54.420:  the universities as well, be encouraged to help their graduates find jobs.
23:55.260 - 23:56.620:  Katie Silver in Singapore.
23:57.120 - 24:01.620:  Another two matches were played at the Women's World Cup in New Zealand and Australia,
24:02.260 - 24:07.360:  including the reggae girls from Jamaica who took on their South American counterparts, Columbia.
24:12.380 - 24:17.480:  That's the sound of overjoyed Colombian fans loudly celebrating their win over Jamaica,
24:17.480 - 24:20.500:  and securing their place in the quarterfinals.
24:20.860 - 24:22.840:  They'll now face England on Saturday.
24:23.360 - 24:26.640:  France also beat Morocco and will now play Australia.
24:27.280 - 24:30.500:  BBC Sport reporter Mimi Fawas was watching the matches.
24:31.180 - 24:33.920:  Today we've seen Colombia go through to the quarterfinals.
24:33.920 - 24:35.780:  They played their match against Jamaica.
24:35.780 - 24:37.700:  That was the first match of the day.
24:38.180 - 24:41.500:  It was a very tough match because they couldn't break Jamaica's defence.
24:41.640 - 24:44.800:  Jamaica have not conceded any goals in the group stages,
24:45.440 - 24:47.920:  and then they finally got that winning goal through Usme,
24:48.520 - 24:49.900:  the captain of Colombia.
24:50.620 - 24:51.160:  Great scenes.
24:51.240 - 24:53.560:  It's the first time they're through to the quarterfinals.
24:53.980 - 24:56.300:  It's a very big moment for the country.
24:56.300 - 25:02.560:  In the second match of today, we saw France thrash debutants Morocco for Nail.
25:02.560 - 25:05.140:  We saw a lot of defensive errors from Morocco,
25:05.140 - 25:08.120:  like we saw in the match against Germany in the group stages.
25:09.100 - 25:10.100:  They too have made history.
25:10.100 - 25:15.180:  First time at this competition, first time getting through to the last 16 first Arab country
25:15.680 - 25:16.880:  to qualify for the World Cup.
25:16.940 - 25:17.760:  They're out.
25:17.940 - 25:20.140:  They've really represented themselves very well.
25:20.340 - 25:22.020:  And we've got the quarterfinals coming up next.
25:22.060 - 25:23.280:  It seems to be going so quickly.
25:23.900 - 25:24.280:  Oh my goodness.
25:24.280 - 25:25.560:  I'm losing track of time.
25:25.560 - 25:27.180:  I don't even know what we're in anymore.
25:27.180 - 25:29.260:  But it's been such a fantastic tournament.
25:29.260 - 25:32.820:  We're going to see, of course, some matches kicking off on Friday.
25:32.940 - 25:36.000:  One of the big ones to look out for, of course, is this weekend
25:36.640 - 25:38.720:  where England will be playing Colombia.
25:39.120 - 25:41.140:  And that's going to be a tough one for England
25:41.140 - 25:43.460:  because Colombia have Linda Kaisedo,
25:43.460 - 25:48.260:  the 18-year-old Real Madrid player who has been fantastic stunning goal
25:48.260 - 25:51.620:  that she had against Germany in the group stages.
25:51.620 - 25:56.160:  And as well, we'll see France take on Australia, the co-host.
25:56.220 - 25:59.580:  So that will be another interesting matchup in the quarterfinals.
26:00.340 - 26:01.660:  That was Mimi Fowers.
26:01.780 - 26:04.300:  Now to something shaken, not stirred.
26:13.800 - 26:16.740:  For the first time ever, the Ian Fleming estate
26:16.740 - 26:20.360:  has allowed a woman to write a James Bond book.
26:20.360 - 26:23.000:  The title is Double O Nothing.
26:23.000 - 26:27.400:  And it's written by Kim Sherwood, who spoke to the BBC's Haley Hassel.
26:27.900 - 26:30.900:  The Fleming's asked me to expand the world of 007.
26:30.900 - 26:34.800:  So that was an opportunity to keep Bond as Bond, a character I love,
26:34.920 - 26:37.420:  but also to expand the stage.
26:37.480 - 26:39.860:  So I've brought in these new 00 characters.
26:40.600 - 26:45.260:  And that has allowed me to create a more inclusive world for Bond.
26:45.360 - 26:48.240:  I've been able to create 003, Johanna Harwood,
26:48.640 - 26:51.000:  the first kind of main character, female 00,
26:51.000 - 26:53.520:  who's named after the first woman to write Bond.
26:53.520 - 26:56.460:  She co-wrote the screenplay of The Doctor Known from Russia with love.
26:56.640 - 26:58.220:  It's obviously been well received so far,
26:58.220 - 27:02.440:  but has there been any opposition or controversy to the fact that it's changed
27:02.440 - 27:03.860:  or it's you that's doing it?
27:04.120 - 27:06.860:  I think any time a woman puts her head over the parapet
27:06.860 - 27:09.820:  and the male dominated space, there will be some opposition.
27:10.280 - 27:12.920:  But what I've been really delighted by is that the majority voice
27:12.920 - 27:15.920:  has been incredibly celebratory and welcoming.
27:15.980 - 27:19.920:  The Bond community is an amazingly diverse and inclusive space.
27:20.100 - 27:22.800:  When you think about it, there's something to be this popular for so long.
27:22.980 - 27:24.920:  There's got to be a lot of angles to it that people can enjoy.
27:25.040 - 27:27.920:  So what I've tried to do is really give the platform and the microphone
27:27.920 - 27:32.840:  to those positive celebratory voices in this brilliant band community.
27:33.200 - 27:35.600:  You've had to keep this a secret for a very long time.
27:36.060 - 27:37.920:  Why was that and how university managed it?
27:38.460 - 27:41.360:  I had to give it a secret because anything in the Bond world is big news.
27:41.640 - 27:44.920:  But it helped me with the writing process because I was able to imagine
27:44.920 - 27:47.640:  I was just a kid again playing James Bond and I was a little kid
27:47.640 - 27:49.880:  I'd buy on my neighbours who luckily were very tolerant people.
27:50.240 - 27:51.920:  And I would turn their movements into mystery stories.
27:51.920 - 27:55.860:  I was bond in my mind and I could go back to that sense of play
27:56.060 - 27:58.920:  and being able to take risks and experiment when it became public.
27:58.920 - 28:01.920:  Obviously I was really delighted with the response from the fans
28:02.140 - 28:04.920:  but it also added to the pressure because suddenly it was public news.
28:05.540 - 28:08.740:  Now the where rumours that the new Bond could have been a different gender?
28:08.740 - 28:11.320:  Did you not want to make a female Bond for a change?
28:11.720 - 28:15.860:  For me that was less interesting to map a female hero onto the template of the male hero.
28:16.120 - 28:17.920:  And like I say, I have loved Bond's character all my life.
28:17.980 - 28:19.720:  I wanted to keep Bond as Bond.
28:19.780 - 28:22.820:  But that was why I thought I'll have him be missing from the beginning.
28:22.820 - 28:24.780:  He's vanished and my six are trying to find him.
28:25.020 - 28:28.580:  Because if Bond is there on page or screen he commands the spotlight.
28:28.580 - 28:32.220:  If you're going to bring in new characters you have to be able to move the spotlight to them.
28:32.720 - 28:36.240:  So I thought if I just ask him to step a little to the left and put him in darkness
28:36.380 - 28:38.540:  I can move that spotlight onto these new characters.
28:38.540 - 28:41.820:  So we have the first gay double-o, the muslim double-o.
28:41.980 - 28:44.780:  I'm hoping that will allow more people to see themselves as the hero.
28:45.520 - 28:48.240:  That was Kim Sherwood, author of Double Own Nothing,
28:48.240 - 28:51.560:  the latest novel in the long running James Bond series.
28:52.260 - 28:54.500:  Finally, and this is my favourite story.
28:54.740 - 28:59.560:  Over the weekend crowds of pet lovers hit the beach to watch dogs of all breeds,
28:59.560 - 29:07.660:  shapes and sizes ride the waves at the world dog surfing championships in Pacifica, California.
29:08.300 - 29:11.780:  Yes, it's a real thing and it sounds amazing in my opinion.
29:12.260 - 29:16.860:  This year the fiercely competitive canine contest helped raise money
29:17.260 - 29:21.200:  for local animal welfare, environmental and surfing nonprofit groups.
29:21.960 - 29:27.920:  One of the proud winners Derby and his human handler Ken Tucky-Gallahue took a pause.
29:27.940 - 29:31.580:  Got it from their celebrations to speak to Davina Gupta.
29:32.080 - 29:35.840:  So first of all, a very big congratulations from all of us on the BBC.
29:36.420 - 29:37.540:  Oh, thank you so much.
29:37.680 - 29:38.220:  Were you nervous?
29:38.480 - 29:40.540:  No, because I don't do anything Derby does all the work.
29:40.920 - 29:42.020:  Was Derby nervous?
29:42.440 - 29:43.480:  No, he's never nervous.
29:43.480 - 29:45.600:  He just loves being in the ocean and hanging out with me.
29:45.800 - 29:47.780:  So did you guys train at all for this event?
29:48.140 - 29:48.760:  We do not.
29:48.760 - 29:52.280:  We go surfing much as we possibly can here in sunny San Diego.
29:52.280 - 29:53.920:  So I don't consider it training.
29:53.940 - 29:57.660:  I just considered a fun day out in the ocean catching some waves.
29:57.960 - 29:59.780:  And tell us about dog surfing.
29:59.780 - 30:01.740:  I have never heard of it Derby.
30:01.740 - 30:05.680:  Now I moved to San Diego seven years ago and we did not even know anything about it either.
30:06.200 - 30:08.500:  It's a competition where there's three categories.
30:08.500 - 30:12.760:  There's solo surfing where the dogs are by themselves on the surfboard
30:12.820 - 30:16.840:  and the owners push them into a wave and they ride the wave as far as possible.
30:17.040 - 30:19.360:  Try to make it to the beach and try to do it in style.
30:19.560 - 30:24.560:  The second is tandem dog dog where there's two or more dogs on a board to get pushed in a wave
30:24.580 - 30:25.760:  and make it all the way to the beach.
30:26.040 - 30:30.480:  And then there's tandem dog human where there's two a dog and their owner on the board together.
30:30.840 - 30:31.100:  Wow.
30:31.100 - 30:34.500:  So how many people were there attending this event this year?
30:34.660 - 30:38.760:  The world dog surfing competition always draws a huge crowd up in North California.
30:38.760 - 30:42.220:  You don't see a lot of dog surfing going on up there because the water is a lot colder.
30:42.360 - 30:45.920:  This year I think there were close to 1,000 to 1,500 people that came to the beach
30:45.920 - 30:47.900:  and watched all the dogs surf this year.
30:48.040 - 30:50.700:  And what's this community like of dogs surfing?
30:51.020 - 30:52.920:  It's like seeing our family again every year.
30:52.920 - 30:56.700:  We do three or four events up and down the California coast including Hawaii.
30:57.300 - 30:59.920:  And we get to meet our surfer friends again.
31:00.020 - 31:03.920:  And we all can't wait for a summer to hit where we can all get to the beach again
31:04.120 - 31:05.720:  and go out and surf with our pups.
31:05.920 - 31:09.920:  Could you tell us about the safety as well for many of these dogs?
31:09.920 - 31:12.940:  Because it seems very tricky what they're doing.
31:13.820 - 31:15.760:  Yes, safety is definitely number one priority.
31:15.980 - 31:19.080:  During these events, all the boards that we use are soft top.
31:19.080 - 31:23.060:  So if the dog accidentally does get hit with the board, it won't hurt them as much.
31:23.140 - 31:25.320:  Dog life vests are very important.
31:25.440 - 31:28.360:  Anywhere that a dog cannot touch the bottom at any time of water,
31:28.360 - 31:31.320:  definitely we suggest the dogs wear a life vest.
31:31.680 - 31:35.840:  And this is a question from my colleague James's seven year old son.
31:36.220 - 31:40.480:  He wanted to know if there are any particular dogs who are better at surfing.
31:40.780 - 31:43.820:  It's all about the heart of the dog and the dog wanting to be out there.
31:43.940 - 31:47.800:  Seeing Chihuahua's, to Frenchies, to Bulldogs.
31:47.940 - 31:49.600:  Derby's actually a golden doodle.
31:50.020 - 31:54.300:  I've seen labs and colleagues and all sorts of types of dogs that love to go out there.
31:54.440 - 31:56.020:  The smaller dogs do a little better.
31:56.060 - 31:58.180:  No, they don't have to be as tall on the board.
31:58.300 - 31:59.840:  But the bigger dogs do just as good.
32:00.020 - 32:02.720:  And how does Derby prepare for this competition?
32:02.980 - 32:05.960:  He just kind of looks at the waves and tells me where he wants to be
32:06.140 - 32:07.400:  and is ready to get out there.
32:07.940 - 32:09.760:  Anytime we're near the beach, he gets super excited.
32:12.300 - 32:13.420:  And that's all from us for now.
32:13.440 - 32:16.540:  But there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
32:16.540 - 32:19.040:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
32:19.580 - 32:21.880:  you can send us an email.
32:21.880 - 32:24.920:  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
32:24.920 - 32:25.700:  You can also find us on Twitter.
32:25.940 - 32:30.900:  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and the producer was Emma Joseph.
32:32.200 - 32:32.300:  The editor is Karen Martin.
32:32.440 - 32:33.720:  I'm your host.
32:34.280 - 32:36.140:  Thank you.
32:36.660 - 32:38.120:  And the producer was Emma Joseph.
32:38.120 - 32:39.760:  The editor is Karen Martin.
32:40.260 - 32:41.200:  I'm Charlotte Gallagher.
32:41.380 - 32:42.680:  Until next time, goodbye.
