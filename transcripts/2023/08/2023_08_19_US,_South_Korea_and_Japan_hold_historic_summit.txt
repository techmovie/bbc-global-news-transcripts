00:48.980 - 00:52.260:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:54.680 - 01:00.360:  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Saturday, the 19th of August, these are our main stories.
01:01.000 - 01:06.020:  President Biden has declared a new era of partnership with South Korea and Japan
01:06.520 - 01:10.220:  as the three nation's leaders unite to criticize Chinese aggression.
01:11.260 - 01:16.860:  The British government has ordered an inquiry after a nurse was found guilty of murdering seven babies
01:16.860 - 01:18.900:  and trying to kill six others.
01:19.740 - 01:23.840:  The head of military police in Brazil's capital is arrested for alleged collusion
01:23.840 - 01:27.080:  with protesters who stormed government buildings in January.
01:29.560 - 01:33.800:  Also in this podcast, we will protest this policy from three days, although we don't think
01:33.800 - 01:37.580:  there's very much chance of changing it. It's a Russian-dominated organization.
01:38.300 - 01:43.480:  Criticism of the decision of the International Chess Federation to ban trans-gender women
01:43.900 - 01:46.500:  from competing in female-only events.
01:51.200 - 01:56.120:  President Biden with the help of China has achieved something that many thought was impossible.
01:56.120 - 02:01.240:  A historic summit between the leaders of South Korea and Japan and Mr. Biden
02:01.700 - 02:04.220:  at which they agreed a range of security measures.
02:04.920 - 02:08.780:  Such a three-way partnership would have been unthinkable until recently,
02:08.780 - 02:15.020:  given the historical antagonism between Seoul and Tokyo over Japan's colonial rule of the
02:15.020 - 02:21.040:  Korean Peninsula. But in the face of an increasingly assertive China and the nuclear threat posed
02:21.040 - 02:25.820:  by North Korea, the three leaders at the Camp David presidential retreat in the US
02:26.220 - 02:32.240:  issued a joint statement accusing Beijing of dangerous and aggressive behavior towards its
02:32.240 - 02:37.280:  neighbors. President Biden also announced the hotline would be created for the three countries
02:37.280 - 02:39.700:  to respond to immediate threats.
02:40.560 - 02:46.300:  We've all committed to swiftly consult with each other and response the threats to any one of
02:46.300 - 02:52.240:  our countries from whatever source it occurs. That means we'll have a hotline to share information
02:52.300 - 02:57.580:  and coordinate our responses whenever there is a crisis in the region or affecting any one of our
02:57.580 - 03:04.540:  countries. And today, we've reaffirmed our shared commitment to maintain peace and stability
03:04.540 - 03:10.140:  in the Taiwan Strait. A correspondent in Washington, Barbara Platt Asher, told us more about what
03:10.140 - 03:14.680:  Mr. Biden and his South Korean and Japanese counterparts had agreed at the summit.
03:15.360 - 03:21.080:  He was talking about a crisis hotline for the leaders in case of a threat or a danger.
03:21.580 - 03:26.700:  And they also signed a new security pledge that would commit them to consult in those events.
03:26.700 - 03:32.280:  So a duty to consult. So very much tying their responses together to any sort of threat.
03:32.280 - 03:37.920:  They are also going to be holding annual military exercises. Now they had held occasional
03:37.920 - 03:42.780:  trilateral three-way military exercises before, but this is now going to become a regular yearly
03:42.780 - 03:47.520:  event. As President Biden said, they were going to double down on information sharing,
03:47.520 - 03:51.740:  especially on North Korean missile launches. And real-time information sharing is what the
03:51.740 - 03:56.660:  Japanese leader called it. And they're also agreeing to hold an annual summit. So very much
03:56.660 - 04:02.820:  trying to make the security relationship a regular, organized, institutionalized thing drawing
04:02.820 - 04:07.800:  them all closer together in that respect. But I suppose the big question for a lot of
04:07.800 - 04:13.380:  observers will be, will this last given the difficult history between South Korea and Japan,
04:13.380 - 04:17.540:  and given the fact that the leaders of these countries could change? For instance, we could see
04:17.540 - 04:23.320:  Donald Trump coming back to power in the US. Yes, that's a very good point. And I think they're
04:23.320 - 04:27.600:  very conscious of the fact that domestic politics in all three countries could reverse this move,
04:27.600 - 04:31.960:  because there are potential leaders who would not be open to continuing such cooperation.
04:31.960 - 04:37.840:  And there's also the public in both South Korea and Japan have their reservations about
04:37.840 - 04:43.900:  the kinds of arrangements the two made to deal with historic grievances. They're not necessarily
04:43.900 - 04:50.200:  happy with them. So there are elements there that could make the agreement fragile. But again,
04:50.200 - 04:55.160:  that is why one of the main aims here was to try to create these structures, these regularized,
04:55.560 - 05:00.000:  formalized moments when they come together and work together, sort of institutionalize the
05:00.000 - 05:04.300:  partnerships so that it would be harder for a successors to dismantle it. And then again,
05:04.300 - 05:09.040:  they reinforce that by this diplomatic weight of holding it at a venue like Camp David,
05:09.040 - 05:13.180:  which of course has hosted several pieces of it. So you had that image of the three leaders at
05:13.180 - 05:17.720:  Camp David talking about a new era in their partnership, and they're hoping that that will
05:17.720 - 05:24.600:  reinforce it. And China, very unhappy about this. It's dubbed this a mini NATO. China really
05:24.600 - 05:29.180:  doesn't like this. You're right. They see this tightening cooperation as the first steps of a
05:29.180 - 05:34.740:  Pacific version of NATO, which would be targeted against Beijing. And some of the things they talked
05:34.740 - 05:40.580:  about was blocks, different blocks in the region, setting them up would create confrontation and
05:40.660 - 05:46.580:  increased tensions and so on. So they have been quite critical of this summit. I mean, analysts say
05:46.580 - 05:51.520:  that they had kind of counted on this historical enmity between Tokyo and Seoul in order to keep
05:51.520 - 05:57.160:  their rivals divided and also to weaken the US system of regional alliances, not wanting this
05:57.160 - 06:02.420:  kind of alliance to take place. So that would make them quite unhappy. But US officials have said
06:02.420 - 06:07.720:  this is not a NATO for the Pacific, but they have not pulled any punches. A joint statement
06:07.720 - 06:12.740:  accused China of dangerous and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. And frankly, I mean,
06:12.740 - 06:16.460:  I think if you get and look at the optics of the summit, it was designed to send a political
06:16.460 - 06:22.320:  message to China that these three cannot be divided. Barbara Plettership. That's the
06:22.320 - 06:27.180:  perspective from Washington, now with her assessment of whether this summit will bring about a
06:27.180 - 06:32.580:  lasting improvement in relations between South Korea and Japan. Here's our sole correspondent,
06:32.580 - 06:39.440:  Jean McKenzie. A year ago, this meeting would have been unthinkable. While the US has long been
06:39.460 - 06:45.060:  pushing its Asian allies to close ranks, to curb China's influence, bitter historic tensions
06:45.100 - 06:51.360:  between South Korea and Japan have kept them apart. Japan's decades-long occupation of South Korea
06:51.360 - 06:56.940:  ended with its defeat in the Second World War, but disputes over its treatment of the Korean people
06:56.940 - 07:02.140:  have dragged on. During the war, Koreans were forced to work in mines and as sex slaves.
07:02.820 - 07:08.160:  Since taking office last year, the South Korean President Yun Song-yul has pushed tirelessly to
07:08.160 - 07:15.080:  improve relations spurred on by the deteriorating security situation in Asia. Nuclear arm China,
07:15.080 - 07:22.060:  Russia and North Korea are increasingly aligning themselves, leaving both Seoul and Tokyo now in
07:22.060 - 07:28.000:  little doubt they need to cooperate. That the countries have come so far in such little time
07:28.000 - 07:34.320:  is remarkable, but this is still a delicate moment. The public here in South Korea and in Japan,
07:34.320 - 07:40.960:  are wary of leaning on each other too heavily. This new three-way relationship cannot be rushed.
07:42.080 - 07:48.420:  Jean McKenzie in Seoul. There are growing questions here in Britain about whether a nurse who killed
07:48.420 - 07:55.620:  seven newborn babies and tried to kill another six could have been stopped earlier. Lucy Letby was
07:55.620 - 08:01.100:  found guilty of murder and attempted murder after a long and harrowing trial in Manchester,
08:01.100 - 08:07.160:  in northern England. The babies died or were left with injuries during a one-year period from June
08:07.160 - 08:14.100:  2015. The UK government has ordered an inquiry into the case after it emerged that doctors who
08:14.100 - 08:20.880:  worked with Letby had repeatedly raised concerns about her with managers only to be ignored.
08:21.520 - 08:24.680:  Our correspondent Nick Garnett was in court and sent this report.
08:25.800 - 08:31.560:  This is the longest murder trial in British legal history. Lucy Letby, convicted of murdering
08:31.560 - 08:37.680:  seven babies, attempting to kill six more, is Britain's most prolific serial killer of children.
08:38.560 - 08:42.760:  This complicated trial heard how a neonatal nurse who worked at the
08:42.780 - 08:47.660:  Countess of Chester Hospital was able to attack some of the most vulnerable and helpless members
08:47.660 - 08:53.320:  of our society. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Evans from Cheshire Police was the deputy senior
08:53.320 - 09:00.000:  investigating officer. This investigation is centered around tiny babies on a neonatal unit
09:00.020 - 09:06.500:  who should have been in a really safe place. To carry out her crimes, the nurse would pick quiet
09:06.500 - 09:11.600:  times of her shift and would use virtually undetectable methods, poisoning the babies with insulin
09:11.600 - 09:16.900:  or injecting air into their bloodstreams or stomachs. Speaking outside the court at the conclusion
09:16.920 - 09:22.980:  of the trial, the senior crown prosecutor Pascal Jones explained how Letby managed to conceal her
09:23.460 - 09:32.180:  crimes. In her hands, innocuous substances like air, milk or medication like insulin would become
09:32.180 - 09:41.000:  lethal. She perverted her learning and weaponized her craft to inflict harm, grief and death.
09:41.700 - 09:45.880:  Consultants first became concerned when they noticed a spike in the number of deaths and medical
09:45.880 - 09:51.880:  collapses on the neonatal ward. They spotted that one person was always on duty when they happened.
09:51.880 - 09:59.520:  Lucy Letby, police have described her as beige, bland, boring, normal. She admitted nothing
09:59.520 - 10:04.360:  there was only ever visibly upset at her own predicament, never at what happened to the babies
10:04.360 - 10:11.720:  she was supposed to be looking after. Letby faced 22 charges and it took the jury 22 days to consider
10:11.720 - 10:16.560:  them. Letby, who refused to go into the dock at the conclusion of the trial, will be sentenced on
10:16.560 - 10:22.780:  Monday. That report by Nick Garnett. Another one of our correspondents, Judith Moritz,
10:22.780 - 10:29.960:  spoke to the mother of one of the babies who died. In August 2015, Lucy Letby was on a night shift
10:29.980 - 10:34.800:  looking after premature twin boys on the neonatal unit at the counters of Chester Hospital.
10:35.560 - 10:40.620:  The baby's mother was on the nearby maternity ward, recovering from their birth. At nine o'clock,
10:40.620 - 10:45.900:  she visited her sons as she did every night to deliver milk. She says she'll never forget what
10:45.900 - 10:53.820:  she heard as she approached. The crying, I've never heard anything like it since, it was screaming,
10:54.760 - 11:00.820:  it was screaming and I was like, what's the matter with them? A court order prevents us from
11:00.820 - 11:06.580:  identifying the families in this case. The twin's mother says she went towards the howling baby.
11:07.180 - 11:17.920:  They had blood, round his mouth and Lucy was there, but fathom about not really
11:19.500 - 11:25.680:  not doing anything. Lucy said to her, don't worry, the registrar was coming and she told me to go
11:25.680 - 11:30.980:  back to the ward. The baby's mum left him in the intensive care area and went to call her husband,
11:30.980 - 11:36.340:  but a short time later they were told he was dangerously ill and they rushed back to find doctors
11:36.340 - 11:43.560:  trying to save him. We were taken in and we were told to talk to him and held his hand,
11:44.840 - 11:54.520:  and then the conversation with the consultant said, you know, we're going to start. It's not
11:54.520 - 12:05.680:  helping. We want to die in your arms. It may be hard to believe that a young nurse with a once
12:05.680 - 12:12.420:  promising future can be guilty of such crimes, but though 13 babies died in one year when Lucy
12:12.420 - 12:17.500:  letby was present, only one infant has died on the unit in the seven years since she stopped
12:18.800 - 12:22.940:  and letby now joins the ranks of Britain's most notorious criminals.
12:24.460 - 12:30.100:  That report by Judith Moritz. Leaders of the military police force in the Brazilian
12:30.720 - 12:34.860:  capital have been arrested on allegations of collusion with supporters of the former president
12:34.860 - 12:39.520:  Jaya Bolsonaro. They stormed government buildings on January the 8th.
12:39.680 - 12:42.580:  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Russia reports,
12:43.340 - 12:46.760:  Among those arrested are Brazilians current police commander Cléptea Gonzalez
12:46.900 - 12:52.000:  and his predecessor Fabio Vieira who occupied the post on January the 8th.
12:52.200 - 12:57.360:  The Supreme Court said the two men and five other officers targeted by the operation either failed
12:57.360 - 13:01.960:  to act or encourage the demonstrators who had been camping in and around the Brazilian
13:01.960 - 13:06.940:  capital for weeks. They were calling for a military coup following Mr. Bolsonaro's electoral
13:06.940 - 13:11.840:  defeat. For hours they've underlined the presidential palace, the Congress building and the Supreme
13:11.940 - 13:17.300:  Court before the security forces intervened. Prosecutors believe that senior figures in the
13:17.300 - 13:22.540:  Bolsonaro government orchestrated the attack with the complicity of police and military commanders
13:22.860 - 13:26.080:  loyal to the former president. Leonardo Russia
13:29.040 - 13:35.380:  Still to come, what I like was really to have actually this opportunity to leave contemporary times
13:35.500 - 13:41.420:  sometimes during the evenings and enter another era, the era of my childhood really.
13:42.320 - 13:46.520:  Iceland's Prime Minister on writing a crime novel during lockdown.
13:54.880 - 13:59.580:  Hey I'm Ryan Reynolds. At Mid-Mobile we like to do the opposite of what big wireless does.
13:59.820 - 14:04.760:  They charge you a lot, we charge you a little. So naturally when they announce they'd be raising
14:04.760 - 14:09.940:  their prices due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.
14:10.220 - 14:15.220:  That's right, we're cutting the price of mint unlimited from $30 a month to just $15 a month.

14:30.060 - 14:31.960:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
14:32.560 - 14:38.380:  The move by the International Chess Federation, Fede to ban transgender women from competing in
14:38.380 - 14:44.500:  its female only events, at least for now, has been criticised by trans rights groups and some players.
14:45.100 - 14:52.020:  Fede says that its review could take up to two years. Malcom Payne is director of International Chess
14:52.020 - 14:56.280:  for the English Chess Federation and an international master and opposes the move.
14:56.880 - 14:58.940:  So why does he think Fede has done it?
14:59.960 - 15:05.400:  It's difficult to read what they're thinking. We view the development as unwelcome and as
15:05.460 - 15:12.160:  discriminatory. I think that what they're concerned about is a very strong male grandmaster
15:12.640 - 15:16.060:  transitioning and winning the Women's World Chess Championship, which had a price fund of
15:16.060 - 15:19.560:  half a million euros this year, because most of the tournaments that they're ruling
15:19.620 - 15:24.680:  women trans women's participation out in are things that qualify towards the World
15:24.680 - 15:27.920:  Championship Cycle. So I suspect that might be the motivation for it.
15:28.620 - 15:33.980:  So many sports governing bodies have been working on policies towards transgender athletes,
15:33.980 - 15:39.600:  but chess, though, does not involve comparable levels of physical activity, does it?
15:40.360 - 15:44.740:  That's precisely right and that's why the English Chess Federation is opposed to this policy,
15:45.100 - 15:49.600:  because it implies that there's some intrinsic advantage to being a man over a woman when it comes
15:49.600 - 15:54.820:  to prowess at chess. And we simply think that that isn't the case, that the main reason for the
15:54.820 - 16:00.500:  disparity in the ratings of male and female players is actually related to the disparity in the levels
16:00.500 - 16:05.840:  of participation. Statistically, it makes sense that if you have a lot more men playing than women,
16:05.840 - 16:08.960:  you're going to have a lot more stronger men in chess than women.
16:09.820 - 16:16.700:  Exactly. I mean, the UK Member of Parliament, Angela Aegel, who was a joint winner of the 1976
16:16.700 - 16:22.520:  British Girls Under 18 Chess Championship said this. She said, I know I was there.
16:22.680 - 16:27.540:  Yeah, this is what she said, because our listeners wouldn't have been there. So she said,
16:27.540 - 16:33.580:  there is no physical advantage in chess, unless you believe men are inherently more able to play
16:33.580 - 16:39.260:  than women. And she said, I spent my chess career being told women's brains were smaller than men,
16:39.260 - 16:44.420:  and we shouldn't even be playing. So she says the ban is ridiculous and offensive.
16:44.420 - 16:50.680:  She's absolutely right. Angela and her twin sister Maria and I all played on the same team in
16:50.680 - 16:55.420:  Liverpool, and they were forced to be reckoned with, and they always took great pleasure in beating
16:55.420 - 17:03.340:  the boys, and the more it upset the boys, the more it pleased them. And Angela is at 100% right
17:03.340 - 17:07.700:  about this, and that's the view of the ETF, and our policy has always been to include trans women.
17:07.700 - 17:14.180:  Indeed, we've had a trans woman play for England, as the female representative,
17:14.180 - 17:19.340:  in one of our teams recently, and we had a trans woman playing in the British chess championships,
17:21.140 - 17:24.520:  eligible for the women's only prize. It's just a couple of weeks ago in Leicester,
17:24.680 - 17:29.260:  and that policy will remain the same. We will protest this policy from Fideil,
17:29.260 - 17:32.840:  although we don't think there's very much chance of changing it. It's a Russian dominated
17:33.740 - 17:40.480:  organisation presided over by a former deputy prime minister of Russia, who has a lot of
17:40.480 - 17:45.580:  votes from countries that have differing social attitudes and morals to those of the United Kingdom.
17:45.920 - 17:50.540:  And they have said that they are still allowed, the transgender women are still allowed to
17:50.540 - 17:57.040:  compete in the open section of its tournaments. Sure, but the policy is still discriminatory,
17:57.040 - 18:01.760:  and therefore the US Federation will oppose it. So we know what the reaction from the transgender
18:01.760 - 18:06.980:  community is. What about wider reaction from the rest of the chess community? Yes, so the German
18:06.980 - 18:11.120:  chess federation has issued a statement condemning the policy. Similarly, the United States
18:11.120 - 18:17.480:  chess federation has been quite vocal in restating its transgender policy that it passed in 2018,
18:17.480 - 18:24.360:  but I don't expect too much other reaction other than the non-social media. I think that the policy
18:25.540 - 18:30.500:  unfortunately will actually be quite popular with the majority of the 190 of member nations in Fideil.
18:30.700 - 18:34.980:  That's a sad fact, I don't fear. Malcolm Payne talking to my colleague,
18:34.980 - 18:41.200:  Kani Sharpe. We heard in our earlier podcast that according to an official in Ethiopia's Northern
18:41.200 - 18:48.000:  Tigray region, at least 1400 people have starved to death since food aid was suspended four months ago.
18:48.760 - 18:53.680:  These deaths come despite the fact that the Ethiopian government and rebel fighters from Tigray
18:53.740 - 18:58.580:  signed a peace deal last year, ending a two-year civil war that has killed thousands.
18:59.360 - 19:04.900:  Aid agencies halted distributions in Tigray in April amid accusations that vital supplies were
19:04.900 - 19:10.020:  being stolen. They also announced a suspension of food aid to the rest of Ethiopia in June.
19:10.900 - 19:17.180:  The BBC has been gathering testimony in one of the worst hit areas of Tigray to see how this
19:17.180 - 19:21.240:  corruption is affecting people there. Mercy Juma reports.
19:23.440 - 19:29.120:  Merbid Hailei is needing dough for making injera, a traditional Ethiopian flatbread.
19:30.160 - 19:34.020:  She is heavily pregnant and takes a couple of poses in between the knitting.
19:34.880 - 19:39.580:  Once ready, the pieces of flatbread will be stretched out to take the 20-80-year-old
19:39.580 - 19:45.440:  in her two children through as many days as possible. Man's of hunger have forced Merbid to beg
19:45.440 - 19:49.400:  to save herself, her two starving daughters and the baby she is carrying.
19:50.500 - 19:54.440:  I'm expecting to give birth very soon, but I have nothing to eat.
19:56.020 - 20:01.060:  Both Merbid and her children are malnourished. She says her family last received aid
20:01.060 - 20:07.020:  way before distributions were officially halted. We've received food aid in November.
20:07.640 - 20:13.120:  Since then, we've received nothing. We are begging for food to live on. It's thanks to the people
20:13.220 - 20:20.900:  that we're not dead, we're still alive. People in Tigray are dying of hunger.
20:21.520 - 20:24.880:  Four months ago, aid organisations, including WFP and EUA,
20:24.880 - 20:27.920:  said stopped handing out food in Tigray because it was being stolen.
20:28.640 - 20:32.260:  The impact was immediate and the decision has already taken its toll.
20:32.900 - 20:37.060:  There are tens of children suffering from wasting a desi-hool general hospital.
20:37.720 - 20:39.720:  Rahel is one of those suffering the most.
20:40.100 - 20:48.300:  She is 80s old and weighs only 10 kilograms. That's the weight of an average one year old.
20:48.860 - 20:51.240:  Her ribs are exposed and she is very weak.
20:51.940 - 20:55.780:  He went to libassi, Rahel's mother, says they stopped getting food deliveries
20:56.080 - 20:58.900:  way before the organisations stopped bringing the food.
20:59.920 - 21:03.780:  It's because of greed and unjust treatment that we didn't get the food aid.
21:04.460 - 21:08.640:  Had the aid been distributed properly, it wouldn't have been stopped.
21:10.060 - 21:12.000:  It's not only the patients who are affected,
21:12.760 - 21:16.360:  Kibra walks in the hospital with her partner and they barely get a salary.
21:19.620 - 21:24.780:  We see many children who lose their mothers. They simply die of malnutrition.
21:25.800 - 21:30.620:  Many children are near death when they are brought to this hospital. We lost four children this month.
21:33.940 - 21:37.820:  Local authorities say they have been investigating the allegations of food theft.
21:38.260 - 21:42.620:  Dr. Gibri-Hueit Gibris-Gerber from the Tigray disaster risk management commission
21:43.040 - 21:44.780:  insists they are taking action.
21:47.780 - 21:52.940:  There is a huge humanitarian crisis in Tigray. People are dying.
21:53.500 - 21:56.060:  From the day the food distribution stopped till now,
21:56.300 - 22:00.060:  1,411 people have died of starvation.
22:00.840 - 22:03.820:  This is only from three zones in the Tigray region.
22:04.460 - 22:10.180:  492 suspects are under investigation. We've carried out the investigation seriously.
22:10.260 - 22:15.500:  We have almost concluded it and 198 of the suspects have been charged.
22:24.260 - 22:27.180:  The majority of those charged work for the local authorities.
22:28.060 - 22:32.000:  WFP acknowledged that the consequences of aid withdrawal have been dire,
22:32.480 - 22:36.920:  but it says that decision was necessary to be sure no more photo will be taken away
22:37.120 - 22:39.160:  from those most in need in future.
22:39.920 - 22:44.500:  A spokesperson told the BBC that they are accelerating efforts to resume food aid.
22:45.020 - 22:49.700:  But first, it is making sure the most stringent processes are in place to best
22:49.700 - 22:52.760:  solve the millions of hungry people who depend on their support.
22:55.660 - 22:57.580:  That report by Mercy Juma.
22:58.440 - 23:01.940:  For years, Iran and Saudi Arabia have been hostile rivals,
23:01.940 - 23:05.100:  backing opposing sides in conflicts in the Middle East.
23:05.580 - 23:09.640:  But in recent months, the neighbouring regional heavyweights have been trying to mend fences,
23:10.040 - 23:13.380:  agreeing to normalise relations as part of a deal backed by China.
23:14.120 - 23:19.460:  Now Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has hosted talks with the Iranian
23:19.460 - 23:25.520:  foreign minister and has been reported that he has accepted an invitation to visit Tehran.
23:26.120 - 23:29.980:  To assess the significance of this, here's our Middle East analyst, Mike Thompson.
23:30.800 - 23:36.040:  She-ite dominated Iran and sunny Muslim Saudi Arabia have spent much of the last decade
23:36.040 - 23:41.460:  at each other's throats. While avoiding fighting each other, they backed opposite sides in
23:41.460 - 23:47.640:  several Middle East conflicts, most notably in Yemen and Syria. Things went from bad to worse
23:47.640 - 23:54.840:  in 2016, when Riyadh cut diplomatic ties with Tehran after Iranian protesters stormed its
23:54.840 - 24:01.160:  embassy there following Saudi's execution of a prominent Shiite cleric. Then in March this year,
24:01.160 - 24:07.680:  the chill suddenly thawed, when both countries agreed to restore diplomatic ties in a surprise
24:07.680 - 24:14.700:  deal broken by China. In June, Saudi's foreign minister visited Tehran, paving the way for his
24:14.700 - 24:20.200:  counterparts trip to Jed of this week, all of which helped soften sanctions hit Iran's
24:20.200 - 24:27.260:  international isolation, and may well ease Saudi Arabia's longed-for exit from its failed fight
24:27.260 - 24:35.020:  against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Mike Thompson, the Edinburgh International book festival
24:35.020 - 24:40.680:  is accustomed to hosting famous authors, but a prime minister is rare. However, this week,
24:40.680 - 24:45.960:  one of the festival events featured the prime minister of Iceland, Catrin Yaqub's dot here,
24:46.100 - 24:50.980:  who, as well as being in charge of running the affairs of state, has become a best-selling
24:50.980 - 24:57.100:  crime novelist. Her book is called Reykjavik. Just what made her write it.
24:58.020 - 25:03.560:  Actually, I come from literature, I used to study literature, I used to study Icelandic crime
25:03.560 - 25:09.420:  fiction before I became a politician and was elected to parliament in 2007. So I've always had
25:09.420 - 25:15.160:  this dream, but I never had the time to do it until the exceptional circumstances we were faced
25:15.160 - 25:21.600:  with during the pandemic when all our existence was changed, and the Ragnarionus and my co-author
25:21.600 - 25:27.620:  actually said, maybe now is the time to write a crime novel, and it actually took quite some time,
25:27.620 - 25:33.580:  probably two years, during the pandemic, but of course, things were, you know, the rhythm of life
25:33.580 - 25:39.360:  was very changed, so actually it was very nice to have something else to think about occasionally
25:39.360 - 25:44.800:  during that time. What's the reaction being of people in Iceland? Well, it was the best-selling
25:44.800 - 25:50.460:  novel last year, and actually, I think everybody expected me to write a book at some point, so
25:51.200 - 25:56.120:  nobody was really surprised. And of course, this genre allows you to say things, doesn't it?
25:56.260 - 26:01.500:  Was that the attraction? Well, actually, this novel is set in the 1980s in Iceland,
26:01.940 - 26:08.440:  in 1986, to be precise, a very big year for Iceland, the year when Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
26:08.440 - 26:12.260:  Gorbachev had their summit in Reykjavik, and many other interesting things happened,
26:13.040 - 26:20.060:  so what I liked was really to have actually this opportunity to leave contemporary times,
26:20.120 - 26:27.940:  sometimes during the evenings, and to another era of my childhood, really. So it was more
26:28.760 - 26:33.360:  of an escape for me to think about something else, and sadly, I don't have many hobbies,
26:33.360 - 26:37.800:  I'm a passionate politician, so literature is really my only hobby.
26:38.160 - 26:42.800:  Yeah, but a crime, when you're writing about crime in Iceland, there is one big problem,
26:42.800 - 26:51.080:  isn't there, that you don't have it. Well, actually, it poses a challenge that we have
26:51.080 - 27:00.620:  luckily not a lot of crime, but however, it's fiction, so it has to be possible, but not necessarily
27:00.620 - 27:05.660:  plausible. I wonder if you're a better prime minister for being a novelist at the same time.
27:06.420 - 27:13.080:  Well, I think everybody becomes, you know, I think it's good for any human being to read fiction,
27:13.080 - 27:19.040:  and to write fiction is just taking that a step further, so I think actually you can learn a
27:19.040 - 27:24.360:  lot from fiction, and a lot has changed in how we see crime fiction, because when I first began
27:24.360 - 27:31.560:  studying it before the year 2000, it feels like ages ago, when I was doing my studies, everybody
27:31.560 - 27:36.120:  asked me, when are you going to study something serious and not crime fiction? But I think it really
27:36.120 - 27:42.580:  reflects on society, so it has very many dimensions, actually. You're going to write another,
27:42.580 - 27:47.920:  is this it? Was it a lockdown thing only? It was a lockdown thing, you never know what's going to
27:47.920 - 27:52.620:  happen after politics, but after lockdown, I really haven't found a moment to sit down.
27:52.740 - 27:56.900:  Back to the day jobs, for all Icelanders listening. Absolutely.
27:58.540 - 28:04.640:  Iceland's prime minister and crime novelist, Catherine Jakub's dot here, speaking to Justin Webb.
28:07.340 - 28:11.980:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
28:12.140 - 28:16.040:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email.
