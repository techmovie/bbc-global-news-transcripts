00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported

00:19.760 - 00:23.760:  I'm Charlotte Gallagher and in the early hours of Sunday, the 6th of August,
00:23.760 - 00:28.440:  these are our main stories. Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan
00:28.440 - 00:35.680:  tries to rally his supporters as he faces three years in jail. A US judge has been asked to limit
00:36.040 - 00:42.440:  what Donald Trump can say about his election fraud case and could a new pill help millions of
00:42.440 - 00:48.100:  mothers with this. It's a very big problem. The estimates are that between 10 and 15 percent
00:48.100 - 00:52.200:  of women who've given birth experience some form of depression.
00:52.740 - 01:01.780:  Also in this podcast, Will Niger's coup leaders meet Sunday's deadline to reinstate the president
01:01.780 - 01:08.900:  or face potential military intervention and why surfers are helping to revive Sri Lanka's
01:08.900 - 01:18.160:  battered tourism industry. But first, the future political career of Imran Khan, Pakistan's
01:18.160 - 01:24.080:  former prime minister, looks uncertain. He is in custody after being sentenced to three years
01:24.080 - 01:30.140:  in prison on corruption charges. He denies wrongdoing and his lawyers say they intend to appeal.
01:30.220 - 01:36.080:  In a video recorded before his arrest, Mr Khan urged his supporters to protest peacefully
01:36.080 - 01:42.260:  against his detention. His party, the PTI, says there have been protests in several cities
01:42.780 - 01:46.920:  with some arrests. Our Pakistan correspondent Caroline Davis reports.
01:50.980 - 01:56.780:  The sound of sirens blaring as police cars whisked Imran Khan away from his home in Lahore.
01:57.220 - 01:59.680:  For the second time this year, he's been arrested.
02:00.700 - 02:05.140:  Earlier today, a judge in Islamabad found him guilty of not declaring money gained when he
02:05.140 - 02:10.920:  sold state gifts, calling him dishonest he sentenced Imran Khan to three years in prison.
02:11.600 - 02:16.200:  Last time Mr Khan was arrested in May, there were protests, some of which turned violent.
02:16.220 - 02:20.820:  He was released, but his PTI party has faced a dramatic crackdown.
02:21.500 - 02:25.580:  Many of his senior party leadership were arrested, then announced that they had left the party.
02:26.240 - 02:30.880:  Police picked up thousands of his supporters. In a pre-recorded video released after his arrest
02:30.880 - 02:34.800:  today, Mr Khan said his supporters should not sit quietly at home.
02:34.800 - 02:41.600:  Buroman, if the judge up there, Gharterena, Jabdaq, peaceful protests should continue until you
02:41.600 - 02:46.620:  get your right. This is your fundamental right to choose your government through voting.
02:47.060 - 02:51.840:  Now we are in a situation where a puppet government has been imposed on the people.
02:52.440 - 02:56.120:  A small number of his supporters gathered outside Mr Khan's home in Lahore,
02:56.460 - 02:59.740:  but were quickly moved on by police. Several hours on since the arrest,
03:00.260 - 03:04.640:  and there have not been reports of mass protest. Today's decision will lead to Imran
03:04.640 - 03:09.220:  Khan's disqualification from the upcoming election. I spoke to Mariam Arangzeb,
03:09.340 - 03:13.100:  the minister for information and broadcasting. It's pretty useful for your party,
03:13.100 - 03:16.680:  though, that your main political opponent has just been disqualified in the run-up for a general
03:16.680 - 03:21.340:  election. Or you have to be accountable for your deeds and law. This has nothing to do with politics.
03:21.720 - 03:25.220:  A person who's been proven guilty by the court has to be arrested.
03:25.720 - 03:30.420:  Mr Khan's lawyers intend to appeal against the decision, but for now he's being held by police,
03:30.420 - 03:33.120:  his political future, deeply uncertain.
03:33.740 - 03:39.300:  Caroline Davis. In the past six months, Donald Trump has been indicted three times,
03:39.300 - 03:46.320:  and arguably his most serious alleged crime is conspiring to subvert the 2020 U.S. presidential
03:46.320 - 03:51.280:  election. Now prosecutors in Washington have asked a judge to issue an order,
03:51.760 - 03:56.140:  which would limit what the former president can publicly discuss about his election
03:56.140 - 04:00.720:  fraud case in public, including on his own social media platform.
04:01.320 - 04:04.520:  On North America correspondent Sean Dilly has been telling me more.
04:05.220 - 04:11.440:  On Friday, Jack Smith, the lead prosecutor in this case, filed a motion with the court asking
04:11.440 - 04:18.280:  that they limit what Donald Trump is able to say in public. This wasn't in direct response to
04:18.280 - 04:23.640:  anything, Mr Trump had tweeted. Mr Smith did cite one of the tweets earlier that day,
04:24.060 - 04:28.140:  where Mr Trump said that someone comes to him, he's going to go for them. This is something that
04:28.140 - 04:32.520:  the court would be a little bit sensitive about. The judge did say that as part of the terms of
04:32.780 - 04:37.420:  bail that Mr Trump shouldn't intimidate the witnesses, but essentially what Mr Smith has done.
04:37.420 - 04:43.800:  As I said, Mr Trump has quite a long history of attacking lawyers and witnesses and judges in his
04:43.840 - 04:48.980:  ongoing legal cases, and we'd like you to not let him release any of the information that we have
04:48.980 - 04:53.440:  to give the defense by law. So if you stop him from doing this judge, we'll release the material.
04:53.440 - 04:56.580:  That's the bottom line. And how unusual is this request?
04:56.900 - 05:00.920:  It's not all unusual. I mean, any criminal case anywhere in the world, particularly in America,
05:01.260 - 05:05.760:  is a minefield of processology. I mean, there's a bit of background noise here, whether it's
05:05.760 - 05:10.440:  very relevant to this particular application. Donald Trump's legal team in his Florida case,
05:10.440 - 05:15.520:  for example, has said he needs time to prepare. And in that case, the prosecution was saying,
05:15.520 - 05:19.580:  no, no, no, we're ready to go now. And the judge actually sort of met them in the middle of
05:19.580 - 05:24.080:  that one in that case. This is a classified documents case. And he's used a face trial on that case
05:24.080 - 05:29.400:  next May. A date's not been set for this one in Washington that revolves around the election
05:29.400 - 05:33.560:  cheating claims. Now it's the most important case because it relates to when Donald Trump was
05:33.560 - 05:38.560:  president of the United States and the allegations are serious that he tried to rob American voters
05:38.560 - 05:41.960:  of their right to vote and he tried to cheat to stay in the White House.
05:42.120 - 05:47.220:  No matter what the ruling is, it'll depend if Donald Trump follows it. And we know that he kind
05:47.220 - 05:51.760:  of is very much his own man. Whoever you are, you really don't have much of a choice about
05:51.760 - 05:56.120:  following court orders. You either comply with them or you don't. The judge made it very clear
05:56.120 - 06:00.880:  as far as the terms of release are concerned that if he, for example, were to intimidate
06:00.880 - 06:05.460:  witnesses, that in itself would be a crime. He was asked to say that he understood that he said
06:05.460 - 06:10.580:  he did understand it. There's always going to be that discussion as to what protection he's
06:10.580 - 06:15.220:  entitled to under the first amendments to the Constitution, which is the right to free speech.
06:15.220 - 06:20.180:  But again, what's at stake here? I argue the prosecutors. It's not necessarily the words. It's
06:20.420 - 06:25.780:  what is the intent of those words and is it calling anybody to action? Is it intimidating witnesses?
06:26.280 - 06:32.660:  Is it going to interfere with the due process of law? Sean Dilly. The Ukrainian president for
06:32.660 - 06:38.680:  Vladimir Zelensky says Russia has attacked a blood transfusion center in the north-eastern
06:38.680 - 06:42.900:  city of Kupiansk. From Kiev, here's our correspondent, James Wardhouse.
06:43.540 - 06:49.720:  President Zelensky claims tonight that a blood transfusion center has been hit by a Russian
06:49.720 - 06:55.600:  guided missile in the Hardikiv region. There are unconfirmed reports that it was close to a village
06:55.600 - 07:02.160:  that was near to the front line. And there is a reality here. If you live close to the Russian
07:02.160 - 07:09.040:  border or if you are close to the front line, you are typically in range of missiles and artillery
07:09.100 - 07:14.520:  fire. And it is a daily occurrence where strikes like these take place. Now, if there is accuracy
07:14.520 - 07:19.460:  to President Zelensky's claim, it appears once again a medical building has come in harm's way.
07:19.460 - 07:24.760:  We've seen it before with a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Malayupal last year. We've
07:24.760 - 07:31.060:  seen it in a mental health hospital in Nipro just a few months ago. This is a war that is synonymous
07:31.060 - 07:37.240:  with civilian areas being directly targeted. Now in President Zelensky's tweet, he says this war
07:37.240 - 07:42.020:  crime alone says everything about Russia and aggression. He says defeating terrorists is a
07:42.020 - 07:48.100:  matter of honor for everyone who values life. We're told there are dead and wounded, but we don't
07:48.100 - 07:54.360:  know much outside of President Zelensky's tweet. James Wardhouse in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia
07:54.360 - 08:01.080:  is hosting talks to discuss a road to peace in Ukraine. Representatives from around 40 countries
08:01.100 - 08:08.460:  including China and India, but not Russia. The 10-point peace plan by President Zelensky is being
08:08.460 - 08:14.760:  seen as a potential stepping stone to a peace summit in coming months. Kyra Rudik is a member of
08:14.760 - 08:20.040:  the Ukrainian parliament. She says they hope to persuade neutral countries to support Ukraine.
08:31.660 - 08:39.040:  But also actually going on the supporting particular points of the peace plan, such as the
08:39.040 - 08:45.200:  nuclear security, the food security, restoring of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
08:45.200 - 08:51.420:  Ukraine and many others. Our chief international correspondent, Liesty Set, told me more about the
08:51.420 - 08:56.660:  significance of the talks. Well, the fact that they're taking place is important. The fact that
08:56.660 - 09:03.740:  there are, as you said, some 40 countries, including China. China didn't attend the last big meeting
09:03.740 - 09:09.540:  that Ukraine played a leading role in in Copenhagen, but it was persuaded to join these talks
09:09.540 - 09:14.980:  in the Saudi-point city of Jeddah. It wants to emphasize the importance of dialogue,
09:14.980 - 09:22.280:  but equally it is also emphasized that it will not allow it to be turned into an anti-Russia
09:22.700 - 09:27.520:  meeting. What Ukrainians and the Americans are saying is they want all these countries to discuss
09:27.520 - 09:34.060:  the ten-point peace plan that President Zelensky came up with quite some time ago. Some of those
09:34.060 - 09:39.780:  principles are easy ones about grain sales, about exchange of prisoners, but others would be
09:39.780 - 09:44.600:  totally unacceptable to Russia, including the complete return of all territories, including
09:44.600 - 09:51.200:  Crimea occupied in 2014, sending Russia to the international criminal court, blaming Russia for
09:51.200 - 09:58.360:  the entire war. This is a very different world now. The Ukrainians and their NATO allies want to see
09:58.360 - 10:05.280:  this as a manicure and struggle good against evil, but these countries like Saudi Arabia, South Africa,
10:05.280 - 10:13.620:  India, Brazil, they're not just neutral, they refuse to take sides. So does Russia feel isolated
10:13.620 - 10:18.740:  at all by the fact that these talks are taking place with these 40 countries? Or as you say,
10:18.740 - 10:23.780:  there are many countries there that don't agree with Ukraine's way forward? Russia has not
10:23.780 - 10:30.280:  surprisingly criticized it. It has described it as an anti-Russia coalition, but I think it would be
10:30.280 - 10:36.660:  reassured by the fact that the Saudis are hosting it. Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of
10:36.660 - 10:44.600:  the kingdom, has made it absolutely clear that in his new Saudi first approach to foreign policy,
10:44.620 - 10:51.400:  he looks both east and west, but most of all he looks to Saudi interest. He works with the Russians
10:51.400 - 10:57.520:  on trying to keep oil prices down. He works with the United States on trying to find peace in Ukraine.
10:58.300 - 11:03.820:  So Russia knows that countries like Saudi Arabia's aren't taking sides at least not for now.
11:04.800 - 11:11.020:  Leasty set. Next post-Natal depression often occurs within six weeks of giving birth.
11:11.100 - 11:18.340:  It has a huge impact, not only on a mother's well-being, but also how she can bond with and care
11:18.340 - 11:24.520:  for her baby. Until now, treatment for the condition was only available as an injection administered
11:24.520 - 11:30.400:  in hospital, but the US has just approved the first pill for postpartum depression,
11:30.980 - 11:36.320:  which is expected to be available later this year. Pam Belek, who's a health reporter for the New
11:36.320 - 11:42.780:  York Times, told me more about the drug. It's called Zerzuwe, and the key things about it
11:42.780 - 11:49.400:  are that it appears to act very quickly, so people can see some easing of depression
11:49.400 - 11:55.480:  beginning at three days, and that's much faster than standard anti-depressants, which do work for
11:55.480 - 12:00.260:  postpartum depression for some women, but they can take several weeks to take effect. And the other
12:00.260 - 12:04.880:  thing that's interesting about this drug is that you're only meant to take it for two weeks. It's
12:04.960 - 12:10.380:  not something that you have to agree to be on for months, and that could be important for some women.
12:10.520 - 12:13.880:  And you've spoken to a woman who took part in the trial, haven't you?
12:14.100 - 12:20.400:  Yes, I did. She's actually British, but she's living in North Carolina now, and she described to me
12:20.400 - 12:28.180:  how when her song was born five years ago, she had a really kind of classic symptoms of this kind
12:28.180 - 12:34.240:  of depression. She was very concerned that she was a bad mother. She was worried that something
12:34.240 - 12:39.140:  would happen to him that she would do something that would either neglect him or just make him
12:39.140 - 12:44.860:  an unhappy baby. It was very debilitating for her, and so she learned about this clinical trial she
12:44.860 - 12:50.820:  participated, and she said to me that it didn't actually take effect right away, but over time,
12:50.820 - 12:58.880:  she really just started to feel calmer, and she was able to just enjoy being with her son.
12:59.420 - 13:04.940:  And you've been researching postpartum depression for years. How big of a problem is it in the United
13:04.940 - 13:09.420:  States? It's a very big problem, and I don't think it's just a problem in the United States. The
13:09.420 - 13:16.720:  estimates are that between 10 and 15% of women who've given birth experience some form of depression.
13:16.720 - 13:22.860:  Sometimes it starts during pregnancy, sometimes it starts within a year after giving birth, and
13:22.860 - 13:30.020:  that's probably a low estimate because, unfortunately, it has been kind of shrouded in stigma, and
13:30.020 - 13:34.360:  women are sometimes reluctant to seek help, or they don't recognize what's happening to them.
13:34.540 - 13:39.600:  And what are the medical communities saying about the impact that this pill could have? I mean,
13:39.600 - 13:44.340:  you talked a bit about stigma there, especially. I think the medical community is quite
13:44.340 - 13:49.920:  encouraged by this, and I think they feel that it's not actually so much that the pill itself
13:49.920 - 13:54.380:  is so much better than anything else that's out there. It probably isn't. It probably has
13:54.380 - 13:59.360:  about the same effect, although it does act quickly, and that's a big plus. But they feel that
13:59.360 - 14:05.020:  having a pill specifically designated for this condition brings attention to this condition,
14:05.020 - 14:11.780:  tells people it's a real problem, and is very likely to encourage more women to seek treatment,
14:11.780 - 14:18.880:  and importantly, encourage the doctors they see who are not always psychiatrists to recognize that
14:18.880 - 14:23.180:  this might be an issue to try to screen for it, diagnose it, and treat it.
14:23.540 - 14:29.600:  That was Pam Belek from The New York Times. A terrorist attack, the coronavirus pandemic,
14:29.600 - 14:35.640:  and a devastating economic crisis have recently battered Sri Lanka's tourism industry,
14:36.280 - 14:41.920:  but now tourists are starting to return, and it could be crucial in helping put the economy back
14:41.920 - 14:48.140:  on track. Archana Shukla reports from Arugam Bay, one of the world's top surfing destinations.
14:51.560 - 14:56.560:  As the sun rises over the turquoise waters at Sri Lanka's eastern coast, the tide is turning for
14:56.560 - 15:02.700:  the better. The surfing beaches in Arugam Bay are buzzing with surfers waiting to catch the perfect
15:02.700 - 15:12.100:  wave. 26-year-old Krish is training a family of three from Israel. Return of tourists to the
15:12.100 - 15:18.620:  island's coast has meant he's giving surf lessons every day. A much-needed breather after the
15:27.460 - 15:34.440:  economic crisis last year. In the eastern coast of Sri Lanka, the peak of the economic crisis
15:34.440 - 15:41.160:  coincided with their main tourist season. Lonely Planet had named Sri Lanka the top tourist
15:41.160 - 15:48.200:  destination in 2019. Many small businesses like Krish had invested, hoping to reap rewards from
15:48.200 - 15:54.320:  the booming tourism potential, but have struggled since then. I had a dream that I want to set up a
15:54.680 - 16:01.500:  cafe, so I put all the money for that cafe at 2019. But then I didn't expect that 2019 we
16:01.500 - 16:05.580:  are going to have a Easter bomb blast and two years of pandemic and then economic crisis.
16:05.980 - 16:11.300:  But foreign tourists are back, giving a boost to Sri Lanka's tourist trade, which is one of
16:11.300 - 16:16.880:  its biggest foreign currency earners. Yasmin, a surfing enthusiast from Germany,
16:16.880 - 16:22.600:  was one of the very few tourists who visited Sri Lanka last April during the worst of the crisis.
16:23.340 - 16:29.160:  She's returned this year to enjoy a full surfing season. So when I came last year to Arugambe,
16:29.360 - 16:35.420:  there were a few shops open and here were almost no people. To see now like the difference,
16:35.420 - 16:41.220:  it's a good atmosphere now. Some of the tourism industries bigger players are optimistic about
16:41.220 - 16:47.120:  navigating the patchy recovery. These Sri Lankans didn't expect the recovery to be this far.
16:47.160 - 16:53.620:  Hirankore is the chairman of Jetwing Symphony, a travel and hospitality chain. He says return of
16:53.620 - 16:59.700:  the flights back to the island nation is promising. So the Emirates, the Katas, the Singaporeal
16:59.700 - 17:06.300:  lines, AI India, all these big carriers are coming back and they are increasing their frequencies
17:06.300 - 17:11.500:  to the country along with our national carriers Sri Lanka. To help prepare the economy, Sri Lanka
17:11.500 - 17:17.280:  received $3 billion from the IMF and in exchange promised to reduce state expenses.
17:18.140 - 17:24.220:  Subsidies on fuel, power and cooking gas have been cut, making them expensive and taxes have
17:24.220 - 17:29.620:  been steeply raised. In the last year, hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans have left the country
17:29.620 - 17:35.120:  seeking better opportunities. The vibrant tourism sector dependent on skilled chefs and
17:35.120 - 17:41.820:  dream manpower now faces a challenging puzzle to fill the gaps left behind. That was our charter
17:41.820 - 17:49.720:  chocolate. Still to come on the Global News podcast, the creators of Lonely Planet celebrate
17:49.720 - 17:56.940:  50 years of travelling and a whopping 150 million book sales. We bought an old car in London,
17:56.940 - 18:02.460:  we drove it to Kabul in Afghanistan. We carried on to Kathmandu.
18:09.480 - 18:15.880:  An Israeli security guard has been shot dead by Palestinian attacker in a busy area of Tel Aviv
18:15.880 - 18:22.420:  according to police. The gunman was also killed. On Friday, a young Palestinian man was killed in
18:22.420 - 18:28.460:  an attack by armed Israeli settlers in a village to the east of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
18:28.940 - 18:34.120:  From Tel Aviv, here's our Middle East correspondent Yo Lan now. Two guards working for Tel Aviv
18:34.120 - 18:38.020:  municipalities were out on patrol when they noticed a man who looked suspicious,
18:38.020 - 18:43.380:  but he didn't respond to their calls to stop, according to Israeli police. As the pair got off
18:43.380 - 18:48.320:  their motorcycles, the man is said to have pulled out a pistol and fatally shot one of the guards.
18:48.380 - 18:54.080:  His partner then shot the Palestinian gunman. Israeli security forces say that the attacker
18:54.080 - 18:58.980:  was from near Janine in the northern West Bank and that he'd been wanted for the past six months.
18:58.980 - 19:04.460:  The Tel Aviv shooting follows an attack by Jewish settlers in the village of Burka on Friday night,
19:04.460 - 19:09.860:  which has further raised tensions in the West Bank. Israeli police say they've arrested two
19:09.860 - 19:14.920:  settlers on suspicion of involvement in the killing of a 19-year-old Palestinian man.
19:15.620 - 19:22.360:  Yo Lan now. Bangladesh is grappling with its worst ever outbreak of dengue fever with heavy
19:22.360 - 19:28.100:  monsoon rains helping drive up infections. Our South Asia Regional Editor, Ambarassan et
19:28.100 - 19:33.920:  Arajan, has been telling me more. This year has been pretty bad for Bangladesh. What the authorities
19:33.920 - 19:39.940:  are talking about is a record number of deaths, nearly 300, and still the monsoon period is
19:39.980 - 19:47.440:  not yet over. It is expected to peak sometime in late August or in September, and we are also
19:47.440 - 19:53.720:  seeing tens of thousands of people infected. Even though most cases people can be treated at
19:53.720 - 19:59.960:  home by taking simple painkillers, but some people who develop very serious symptoms like in a fever,
19:59.960 - 20:05.380:  nausea, body hagg, they have to be admitted in hospital. Now, the issue is there is no proper
20:05.380 - 20:10.720:  treatment available for dengue, and that is making things complicated. Now, how these develops
20:11.380 - 20:16.740:  because people get bitten by infected mosquitoes, and that is how the disease spreads.
20:17.580 - 20:23.120:  Wherever the water is stagnant, especially in big cities like Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh,
20:23.120 - 20:28.380:  and people are having problems. And now, Bangladesh has a developing country, even though it has
20:29.220 - 20:34.580:  health infrastructure, it is not sufficient enough to meet this extraordinary numbers. And that is
20:34.580 - 20:41.340:  why now experts are advising people to cover yourself fully, even during the day, to avoid this
20:41.340 - 20:46.760:  mosquito bites. And I've been reading the global warming and the changing weather pattern
20:47.200 - 20:53.320:  is linked to the spread of dengue fever. How how's that? What experts are saying is that usually from
20:53.320 - 20:58.940:  June to September, when in the subcontinent where you have monsoon rains, because of the changing
20:58.940 - 21:04.400:  weather pattern, now you have this unseasonal rain, sometimes starting from April. This is prevalent
21:04.400 - 21:10.140:  in more than a hundred countries, particularly tropical and subtropical countries in South Asia
21:10.480 - 21:16.400:  and Southeast Asia. The experts are worried about the disease moving to sub-Saharan Africa,
21:16.400 - 21:21.540:  or even parts of Europe, where this is not an endemic, but the changing weather pattern,
21:21.540 - 21:27.200:  the changing rains is why the world health organization estimates that probably between
21:27.200 - 21:33.980:  100 to 400 million people getting infected every year, even though most cases are not serious,
21:34.500 - 21:39.500:  even if a fraction of that number could have a huge impact on health infrastructure, particularly
21:39.500 - 21:46.060:  in developing countries. Ambarassan at Aarajan. The seven-day deadline given by West African leaders
21:46.060 - 21:52.420:  to the military in Niger expires today, the regional block Eko Was has told the junta who carried
21:52.420 - 21:58.280:  out the coup to reinstate President Mohammed Basoum or face potential military intervention.
21:58.420 - 22:04.320:  Priyanka Sipi has been speaking to people about their daily life in Niger since the coup almost
22:04.320 - 22:12.520:  two weeks ago. I'm in Maradi. It is roughly 50 kilometers away from Nigerian border, so since
22:12.520 - 22:19.200:  this is Sadis Husani, a local government chairman of Maradi, a city in the south of Niger.
22:19.200 - 22:25.480:  When we spoke to him, he was in his car trying to charge his phone. The electricity had been out
22:25.480 - 22:32.120:  for more than 24 hours. Nigeria recently cut off the power supply to Niger after the coup.
22:32.500 - 22:36.060:  That move took away around 60% of the country's electricity.
22:36.660 - 22:45.360:  For the first time, there was power cuts and there was a blackout, so it like already electricity
22:45.880 - 22:48.980:  has become a problem. And that is not all.
22:49.180 - 22:56.300:  Sani says the price of basic food staples is increasing. The prices of products and items are
22:56.300 - 23:05.120:  already going high. Shops are open, but scarcity for some products is already there. There is a kind
23:05.120 - 23:08.080:  of anxiety and fear in the air.
23:12.660 - 23:17.640:  Most of a backer lives in Niger's capital, Niyameh. He runs a food business.
23:18.420 - 23:23.060:  He has seen the same hike in food prices and thinks that worse is to come.
23:23.980 - 23:30.160:  For now, it's too early to see what exactly will happen. But in 10 days, I believe if there is
23:30.160 - 23:35.920:  a lack of goodness, price will double, because we feel that there will be no more food in two
23:37.840 - 23:37.860:  weeks.
23:44.980 - 23:50.660:  Those are the sounds of protesters gathered in Niyameh to demonstrate against the strict sanctions
23:51.220 - 23:56.680:  placed on Niger from the economic community of West African states or Ekoas.
23:56.680 - 24:05.800:  Protesters say that the sanctions are illegal and inhumane, and it could be ordinary families that pay
24:05.800 - 24:15.960:  the price. 31-year-old Ismakhil Amadou lives in Niyameh with his wife and two children. He makes
24:15.960 - 24:21.700:  and sells jewelry, and this is his family's only source of income. He says business has been
24:21.780 - 24:23.340:  slow since the takeover.
24:25.660 - 24:30.940:  We don't even have a single customer. There are others like myself who have also
24:30.940 - 24:36.000:  closed their stores. If this continues like this, our future is in big trouble.
24:42.000 - 24:47.040:  As discussions between Ekoas continue, Nigerians are left to wait for their fate.
24:48.320 - 24:53.360:  And while the coup has received mixed reactions in the country, with some Nigerians showcasing
24:53.360 - 24:58.200:  their support for the military takeover, all are praying for peace and stability.
25:00.720 - 25:07.460:  Priyanka Sipi with that report. Now, a surprise participant at an indoor cycling class in California
25:07.460 - 25:14.260:  has raised eyebrows. Even among the star-studded residents of Santa Monica, James Lewellyn takes up
25:14.260 - 25:20.600:  the story. A dark room, pounding music, and sweaty bodies. No, it's not a nightclub,
25:20.600 - 25:25.280:  it's an indoor cycling session. They've become some of the most popular fitness classes around
25:25.280 - 25:30.500:  the world, espoused even by world leaders and celebrities. So, when the two took influence,
25:30.500 - 25:35.240:  Hannah Harmalyn arrived at her takeover swift theme session in Santa Monica, and spotted security
25:35.240 - 25:40.060:  guards outside, she thought her wildest dreams had come true. I'm like, what is going on?
25:40.140 - 25:44.500:  My mind immediately goes, like, holy s***, Taylor Swift is about to be riding in my 7am
25:44.500 - 25:48.600:  soul cycle class. Like, she's performing in LA, like, celebrities do this all the time.
25:48.700 - 25:52.960:  The mystery deepened during the class, three security guards stood in the corner throughout,
25:53.500 - 25:57.540:  and the instructor kept the lights down low, raising hopes among the cyclists that they had
25:57.540 - 26:01.440:  a pop legend in their midst. And of course, you've heard of like Justin Bieber coming in and
26:01.440 - 26:06.020:  singing a song and like Beyonce and Jay Z, like, riding class. So I'm freaking out the whole time.
26:06.180 - 26:09.840:  So the class ends and I'm looking around trying to see where she is. It turns out it was the
26:09.840 - 26:14.640:  prime minister of the UK. Apparently, he's a swifty. Rishi Sunak is in California for a family
26:14.640 - 26:19.760:  holiday and has previously confessed his liking for Taylor Swift. His wife is also a fan of indoor
26:19.760 - 26:24.580:  cycling classes. She's rumoured to have joined Jill Biden for a session the day after the
26:24.580 - 26:28.680:  King's coronation. But Downing Street wouldn't be drawn on the prime minister's latest
26:28.680 - 26:33.020:  foreign into the world of high-tech exercise, saying it wouldn't provide a running commentary on
26:33.020 - 26:39.120:  his very California holiday. That was James Lewellen. And finally, years before the internet,
26:39.120 - 26:45.500:  mobile phones and Google Maps, adventurous backpackers set on traveling the world, relied on the
26:45.500 - 26:52.700:  Lonely Planet Guide, which is now 50 years old. Over the decades, more than 150 million books
26:52.700 - 26:58.680:  have been sold, giving travelers tips on budget hotels, the best bars, and how to get cheaply
26:58.680 - 27:05.680:  from 8 to B. Tony Wheeler co-founded the Lonely Planet with his wife Maureen. He told Gary O'Donohue
27:05.680 - 27:12.820:  how it all started. We bought an old car in London. We drove it to Kabul in Afghanistan and we sold
27:12.820 - 27:20.080:  the car in Kabul. We carried on to Kathmandu. We went down to another K, Kudabic in Bali, and then
27:20.120 - 27:25.800:  hitched a ride on a yacht and ended up in Australia. And then the following year, 73, which was 50 years ago,
27:26.580 - 27:30.080:  we decided we should do a book about this, and that was the start of Lonely Planet.
27:30.860 - 27:34.140:  And what was your idea? What did you think you had to tell people?
27:34.280 - 27:39.940:  This is so long ago, before mobile phones and the internet and readily available information.
27:40.460 - 27:44.260:  And we'd had a lot of trouble finding out what we were going to do, where we were going to go,
27:44.260 - 27:48.760:  how we were going to do it, where we would stay. All those questions that travelers always have.
27:49.300 - 27:53.340:  And basically, we found out by asking other people, that was the main source of information.
27:53.860 - 27:59.760:  And we thought there was demand there. People asked us what we did, and we said,
27:59.980 - 28:03.820:  yeah, let's make a book about it. We didn't take it to any publishers. We were living in Sydney,
28:03.820 - 28:08.700:  and this was a short-term thing. We were going to be there in Sydney for a year. Now we were going
28:08.700 - 28:12.960:  to go traveling again and eventually end up back in London, we thought, which never happened.
28:13.580 - 28:18.480:  We didn't have the time to wait around and see what publishers thought and wait for decisions to
28:18.480 - 28:22.980:  come back. So we decided to do it ourselves. We just published the book. Found a little local
28:22.980 - 28:29.060:  printer, got copies printed, brought them back to our basement flat in Sydney, and borrowed a stapler
28:29.060 - 28:33.420:  and stapled them and trimmed them and took them around the bookshops. How many do you sell?
28:33.560 - 28:40.300:  We initially printed 1,500, which we thought seemed like a lot of books. And I took a day off work,
28:40.460 - 28:45.240:  because we both had full-time jobs. This was an evening's and weekend project. I went around
28:45.240 - 28:49.760:  the bookshops and to my other amazement, the bookshops liked it, and then it got a little bit of
28:49.760 - 28:54.180:  publicity. And before you know, we'd sold the whole lot in a week, so we had to go back and
28:54.180 - 28:59.020:  print more. We're in a very different world now. There's a million different review sites,
28:59.020 - 29:07.180:  there's mobile phones, other days gone of an author or two authors, but you in the page telling
29:07.180 - 29:12.640:  you what to go and look for, telling you what's good, what's bad, is this whole crowd sourcing thing
29:13.120 - 29:18.180:  as that replaced lonely planet as an idea? No, it's supplemented it. There's room for both.
29:18.220 - 29:24.060:  I still use guidebooks. I sometimes have them in digital form. I sometimes have them in paper.
29:24.360 - 29:28.280:  If people want adventure, if people want to go somewhere and be off the beaten track,
29:28.320 - 29:32.480:  they will do it. They will find their way there. That was Tony Wheeler.
29:35.240 - 29:39.660:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
29:40.160 - 29:45.200:  This edition was mixed by Lewis Allsop and the producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen
29:45.200 - 29:48.240:  Martin. I'm Charlotte Gallagher. Until next time, goodbye.
