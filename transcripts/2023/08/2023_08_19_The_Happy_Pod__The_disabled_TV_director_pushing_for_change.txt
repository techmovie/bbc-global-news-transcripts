00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.460:  by advertising. Wow, what an experience to be a part of the Tokyo Olympics. It's so
00:16.460 - 00:19.940:  interesting. It's one of the pinnacles of my athletic career.
00:20.260 - 00:25.500:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympic and Paralympic athletes share their remarkable stories
00:25.500 - 00:30.540:  from the struggles. Lots of sacrifices, lots of hard work, tears, a lot of things that
00:30.540 - 00:36.480:  the outside world doesn't know. To the victories. In the last one, I could do anything that anybody
00:36.480 - 00:42.200:  else could do. On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:44.480 - 00:50.020:  Hi, I'm Nancy. I'm from the United States and I'm going to be talking about why dogs make you so
00:50.020 - 00:54.160:  happy. I'm Toby Cumberbatch and I'd like to shed a little light on the happy part.
00:54.400 - 00:59.520:  I'm Catherine in Ithaca and I am Farah in Ithaca and this is the happy part. This is the happy
00:59.520 - 01:10.540:  part from the BBC World Service. I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday,
01:10.540 - 01:16.900:  the 19th of August, improving the representation of disabled people in film and TV and the director
01:16.900 - 01:22.940:  pushing for change. Disabled kids in particular, civil talent needs to be able to dream and I think
01:22.940 - 01:29.420:  we're starting to make steps to do that. The Ukrainian soldier who became a ballet star after losing
01:29.420 - 01:42.320:  both legs in the war, also in this edition. The rescue of four surfers who spent 36 hours lost
01:42.320 - 01:47.780:  in Indonesian waters. We'll hear about the increasing evidence for the health benefits of even
01:47.780 - 01:53.320:  brief interaction with dogs. People often think of it as kind of a feel good nice to have. It's
01:53.320 - 02:00.560:  actually more than that. And the yellow dress and the shock of going viral. Oh, I mean horror, I
02:00.560 - 02:07.400:  would say. I felt a bit overwhelmed. I was quite horrified actually. I was delighted.
02:12.620 - 02:18.420:  One in six people in the world has some kind of disability. But a lot of industries simply aren't
02:18.420 - 02:24.340:  that welcoming or inclusive. Jordan Hogg, who's been a TV director for 15 years, is trying to
02:24.340 - 02:29.840:  change that. Jordan, who has cerebral palsy, says he has never worked with another disabled
02:29.840 - 02:36.180:  director. He and his close friend, producer Jules Hussey, have made a documentary about opening
02:36.180 - 02:41.260:  up the industry. Jordan told us why it matters so much. What people don't realise is that
02:41.580 - 02:46.480:  literally everybody on the planet at some point in their life will become disabled. We did the
02:46.480 - 02:51.440:  show called Ralph and Katie last year, which was the first ever show to our two learning disabled
02:51.440 - 02:56.500:  lead actor. Had any people with disabilities in our industry, so we had to have trainees with
02:56.500 - 03:02.560:  disabilities. We were thinking, why isn't our industry doing more? I mean, I always say we're
03:02.560 - 03:07.920:  in the industry of making magic and dreams. How come we haven't made these disabled kids dreams
03:07.920 - 03:12.740:  come true to work in our industry and our main objective is this documentary, this project,
03:12.740 - 03:17.480:  was to kind of raise awareness that there is all this talent out here with these unique
03:17.480 - 03:22.020:  points of views and these unique stories to tell. But do you think it's improving? Do you think,
03:22.340 - 03:27.180:  for instance, the days of an able-bodied actor playing someone with a disability are over?
03:27.540 - 03:31.880:  We're in the age now where you can't be done anymore. It's completely unethical. We're
03:31.880 - 03:36.760:  split to another wonderful actor called Kurt Yeager, who used to be in the World Championships
03:36.760 - 03:42.600:  of BMX. Have he lost his leg in a motorcycle accident? Everyone, like I talked to, who's a writer,
03:42.600 - 03:47.220:  unless they have a friend who's a wheelchair user, they think the wheelchair is a character trait
03:47.220 - 03:52.040:  when it's just a mode of transportation. So to me, like, missing a leg is the least interesting
03:52.040 - 03:59.360:  thing about me. What's interesting is my disability is I wear pants and all of a sudden I'm able
03:59.360 - 04:06.360:  bodied. I am treated as a man walking into the room unless I'm wearing shorts and then I'm treated
04:06.360 - 04:11.140:  as a disabled guy walking into a room and they are starkly different. I became a better human
04:11.140 - 04:16.300:  because of it. I became more honest with myself. I am nicer to other people. Everyone says,
04:16.300 - 04:20.700:  well, would you want your leg back? And I say, do I get to keep my experiences? Because if I don't
04:20.700 - 04:25.340:  get to keep my experiences, I don't want my leg. And people can't wrap their head about it. I'm
04:25.340 - 04:29.440:  like, you don't understand, losing my leg was the best thing to happen to me. It gave me a level
04:29.440 - 04:36.020:  of perspective that I would have never got any other way. In your documentary, you do illustrate
04:36.020 - 04:43.380:  some of the change that is coming to the industry, not least a big breakout star called James Martin.
04:43.860 - 04:51.580:  And the first part of Down syndrome can then, three awards, one is the BAFTA and the Oscar,
04:52.100 - 04:58.480:  people with any disabilities who come up to me and say, you've inspired me so much. And I think
04:58.480 - 05:05.120:  that's really lovely. I would just say to them, for your dreams. How big a difference do you think
05:05.120 - 05:12.020:  visibility makes in your industry? I'd like to see disabled actors playing non-disabled
05:12.020 - 05:17.940:  characters and disability just generally not be a thing in our industry that I think disabled
05:17.940 - 05:22.580:  kids in particular, disabled talent needs to be able to dream. And I think we're starting to make
05:22.580 - 05:26.960:  steps to do that, but we're still having a lot more to do. That was Jordan Hogg and you can hear
05:26.960 - 05:31.820:  directing disability by searching for the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
05:32.820 - 05:38.240:  Now imagine walking into an art exhibition and unexpectedly seeing yourself on the wall.
05:38.240 - 05:44.060:  That's what happened to grad student Farah Bakari at a gallery in Ithaca, New York.
05:44.060 - 05:49.260:  The artist was Farah's neighbour, Catherine O'Neill, who had rather cleverly suggested
05:49.680 - 05:54.660:  that Farah might like to wear the same bright yellow dress to the exhibition as she was wearing
05:54.660 - 06:01.540:  in the artwork. Will let Catherine describe that painting. So it has fire and smoke, I think smoke
06:01.540 - 06:07.000:  is the most unusual thing about it. And Farah in her lovely yellow dress with her beautiful dark skin
06:07.400 - 06:12.960:  and some neighbours who also live across the street, a little boy looking into the fire is very
06:12.960 - 06:19.540:  lush and there's lots of flowers. So Farah, tell us about the point when you realised you
06:19.540 - 06:28.480:  had been immortalised in art. I came in and I was walking through the gallery and the other artists
06:28.480 - 06:32.540:  were all looking at me and I thought oh maybe I just look like somebody that they know. But then I
06:32.540 - 06:38.300:  saw the painting and I was very surprised and was kind of stunned and I was very moved. It wasn't
06:38.300 - 06:43.040:  just that I was independent but it was it carried something so that it's very true to our street,
06:43.040 - 06:46.860:  you know, it's talking to other neighbours in this beautiful garden. What was your neighbourhood
06:46.860 - 06:52.860:  like, Catherine? I think in the immediate neighbourhood we're very close and go back and forth
06:52.860 - 06:59.280:  for dinners and glasses of wine and gardens but also that's a bit international because
06:59.740 - 07:04.800:  very internationally. Several people here myself and the neighbours on the north side have
07:05.200 - 07:13.500:  refugees from Ukraine and Afghanistan and then those Farah. I'm from Somalaland and my housemate
07:13.500 - 07:18.540:  is from the Netherlands. It's very intergenerational and international and very close-knit community.
07:18.920 - 07:24.660:  And you know, Catherine is a fixture of our streets. My housemate and I always talk about that
07:24.660 - 07:30.380:  if the street had a sound, like a signature sound, it would be the children yelling Catherine's name.
07:30.380 - 07:35.020:  Like you just hear that name all day long. Catherine, Catherine, she takes care of everybody. She
07:35.020 - 07:41.240:  can smell to swim practice, to driving lessons and that is really wonderful to hear. Even though
07:41.240 - 07:45.340:  the one who's in the painting for me when I think of Ithaca in our street, it's like Catherine
07:45.340 - 07:51.120:  and the other neighbours who I think about. Well, that's extremely nice. I don't think of myself as
07:51.120 - 07:56.260:  fixture if it's certainly the children who can play a lot. And so what did you make of the
07:56.260 - 08:04.780:  internet reaction? Oh, I mean horror. I was hiding for a week. I just, I really, it was horrifying
08:04.780 - 08:10.340:  to learn how big it has gone because I wrote it in my, I'm very small Twitter account. That's mostly
08:10.340 - 08:16.900:  just academics and I wrote this story and then I went to bed and I woke up and my friend texted me
08:16.900 - 08:21.720:  and she told me this and I opened my phone and I was horrified and I muted everything immediately
08:21.720 - 08:26.040:  within a day. All these people were like people I went to high school, I went to college with,
08:26.040 - 08:30.120:  they texted me or like I was trying to get on the bus and the best driver recognized me.
08:30.280 - 08:36.240:  I was quite horrified actually. I was delighted. I don't know. I feel like even though
08:36.240 - 08:41.720:  the reaction was so wonderful, it's rare that the internet ever has a nice thing to say and they all
08:41.720 - 08:48.520:  agree on something being nice. But it's, so it's not natural for tens of millions of people to look
08:48.520 - 08:53.300:  at a picture of you. Although I, I love that people love the painting and and have been painting
08:53.300 - 08:57.540:  in the story. Ultimately, I was horrified. I thought it was kind of wonderful.
08:57.900 - 09:03.960:  Artist Catherine O'Neill and her friend and neighbour Farah Bakari and I will of course share
09:03.960 - 09:10.780:  that painting on social media using the hashtag the happy pod. Now this is something you might
09:10.780 - 09:16.860:  be able to get involved with a project to deliver cheap, efficient, environmentally friendly light
09:16.860 - 09:21.840:  to the many millions of people who live in places where that isn't readily available.
09:22.440 - 09:27.080:  Toby Cumberbatch is one of the organisers of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
09:27.080 - 09:32.000:  Engineers. Let's make light competition. For anybody who's ever lived in the dark,
09:32.000 - 09:37.200:  I think you soon come to appreciate a tiny, tiny bit of light. When there's no moon and no sun
09:37.200 - 09:42.200:  and you're in the middle of a rural area, so there's no reflected city lights. It's absolutely
09:42.200 - 09:48.880:  pitch black and you really can't do much. You have to feel your way around. So it's a tiny bit of
09:48.880 - 09:54.100:  light in those circumstances. It's transformational. So when you talk to people in these situations,
09:54.100 - 10:00.300:  you learn an awful lot about light and its usage and what's good light and what's bad light.
10:00.660 - 10:04.680:  Let's make light as your competition. Tell us about that. What are you looking for?
10:05.300 - 10:10.480:  There's lots of organisations out there which make light for this environment, but in general,
10:10.480 - 10:17.100:  people cannot buy them or they're just not available. So this competition is asking for a
10:17.100 - 10:23.040:  design revolution. So you've always got the manufacturing of the light which we want to consume
10:23.040 - 10:28.500:  as little energy as possible, design something which fits into a circular economy and ideally
10:28.540 - 10:34.460:  something which you could replicate anyway. It would be self-powered, use very simple machinery.
10:34.460 - 10:39.960:  Then nationwide distribution, how do you get this light source and basically take it into the
10:39.960 - 10:45.900:  rural areas and I don't think any system exists like this anywhere in the world. It always stops
10:45.900 - 10:50.920:  at the bigger times or the bigger villages. So to me, the biggest challenges in this is getting
10:50.920 - 10:56.640:  it out into the rural areas where you have to know the community, you have to know the culture,
10:57.000 - 11:01.260:  and then of course there's a big problem payment because if you're a subsistence farmer,
11:01.260 - 11:08.260:  your income tends to be very variable. So we hope that people who actually understand the problem
11:08.260 - 11:13.780:  and think they have a solution are going to be those that contribute. We're looking for ideas
11:13.780 - 11:20.420:  in a sense which nobody has had or people have had but aren't well known. Deadline is the end of
11:20.420 - 11:25.800:  September, but this is a multi-year competition and so we see this as very much as a learning year,
11:25.800 - 11:32.340:  perhaps using this then to jumpstart a competition which gets better known and attracts more people
11:32.340 - 11:39.460:  as time goes on. The winning team will get $4,000 to help develop their idea and if several good
11:39.460 - 11:45.600:  ideas come in, then I think it is our intention to try and help each of those ideas move forwards.
11:45.880 - 11:51.200:  Toby Cumberbatch and yes, he is related to Benedict. I asked and if you want to get involved in
11:51.200 - 11:57.380:  that competition just put i, e, e, e, let's make light in your search engine. Now let's hear
11:57.380 - 12:07.100:  from Sophia originally from Spain but now living in the US. That was the sound of bread crackling
12:07.100 - 12:12.920:  straight out of the oven. So when bread cools, when you pull it out, pull it out of the oven,
12:12.940 - 12:21.160:  the crust rearranges itself, it expands and it makes this really happy sound, it sings.
12:22.060 - 12:29.820:  You described it as the sound that brings you joy. You obviously love baking but you don't just
12:29.820 - 12:35.020:  bake. You bake with a purpose. Tell us about the bread you started making in March 2022.
12:36.040 - 12:43.140:  That day was March 8th, 2022, a walk up and I was hyperventilating. I was very excited because
12:43.140 - 12:51.640:  I had an idea that I had to bake bread in the shape of sunflowers, sell it to my neighbors and
12:51.640 - 12:59.680:  gather the money they gave me and send it to World Central Kitchen. They help disaster victims
12:59.680 - 13:08.680:  around the world. I heard about Ukraine and I felt powerless. I had met Ukrainian people before
13:08.680 - 13:15.100:  that were so lovely and I saw images of their country being shattered and just broke my heart
13:15.140 - 13:19.960:  but I thought, well, here I am in Little Billair, Maryland, what am I to do about it?
13:20.560 - 13:25.840:  But then I had this realization, this clarity that, yeah, there's something I can do.
13:26.480 - 13:34.420:  So I decided to post a picture of this one little sunflower that I made out of bread on my
13:34.420 - 13:41.220:  neighborhood page and all the neighbors were on board and it's been amazing ever since and people
13:41.220 - 13:53.460:  love it. Sophia. Still to come in this podcast, there's some evidence that interacting with a dog
13:53.460 - 13:58.120:  makes us smarter. She's a scientist, she knows what she's talking about.
14:04.000 - 14:09.000:  Now a lot of the stories that we're most interested in don't start from a joyful place but
14:09.000 - 14:14.100:  celebrate the resilience and creativity of people who find a way to use or work with them
14:14.100 - 14:20.180:  is fortune and this is one of those. Alexander Brutko was a graphic designer and coffee shop
14:20.180 - 14:27.640:  barista when Russia invaded his native Ukraine in 2022. He signed up to fight and lost both his
14:27.640 - 14:34.280:  legs below the knee. Now, though, he is part of the united Ukrainian ballet company performing
14:34.280 - 14:39.980:  with and without his prosthetics in a work about the consequences of war and human resilience.
14:40.880 - 14:47.060:  Alexey Gugidze is a fellow dancer and was Alexander's interpreter for us. So what took
14:47.060 - 14:53.820:  Alexander to his unlikely new career? In general, I've been always interested in culture.
14:54.320 - 15:01.120:  During the war and after that happened to me, I've been looking for different elements of culture
15:01.120 - 15:06.860:  and Alexey to tunic invited me to see the ballet and when I first saw it, it came to
15:06.860 - 15:14.300:  be in mind that it's so difficult and this exact difficulty inspired me to try it myself.
15:14.480 - 15:18.320:  Tell us a little bit more about the choreography. The choreography was so color.
15:18.800 - 15:23.480:  First of all, we've been looking for a choreographer. I was ready to work on this space
15:23.840 - 15:30.760:  and I'm eveling, agreed to work with us and first it was something simple but it was way
15:30.760 - 15:37.120:  easy to me. So I asked her to make it more complicated and like two weeks before the performance,
15:37.120 - 15:41.400:  we changed it and it started out to be what it is.
15:43.660 - 15:51.300:  And you also are involved in Invictus Games for injured soldiers. All of this is physically
15:51.300 - 15:58.600:  very, very demanding. Why do you feel compelled to do what you do?
15:58.620 - 16:06.320:  Yeah, you'd go for an animal, yes, even before the war, I was pretty active. So after the injury,
16:06.320 - 16:12.880:  no matter how absurd it sounds, I acquired even more possibilities. So I'm still always doing
16:12.880 - 16:18.380:  something. So I was with ballet and Invictus. I just can't see it at the same place all the time.
16:20.500 - 16:28.000:  And just finally, what does it mean for you when an audience responds at the end of a performance?
16:28.380 - 16:34.840:  So the challenge is that what I'm doing is a right thing because if people around me appreciate
16:34.840 - 16:41.080:  what they do means that it's not just entertainment and it is what moves me forward. It's
16:41.240 - 16:46.560:  might give people inspiration and hope for the better future and the better presence.
16:47.000 - 16:53.280:  Alexander, Budko and his colleague, Alexi Gugidze of the United Ukrainian Ballet Company.
16:54.240 - 16:58.600:  Now a lot of us are having to think about weather extremes and how to be prepared for them.
16:58.960 - 17:05.200:  And our chimpanzee sanctuary is doing emergency drills with its residents to ensure that they
17:05.200 - 17:11.480:  are ready to take cover too. Jordan Garbarino is the chimpanzee training supervisor at
17:11.480 - 17:17.520:  Chimp Haven, a retirement home, if you will, in Louisiana. So what's the appeal of working with chimps?
17:18.360 - 17:23.200:  Oh gosh, don't get me started. I became really fascinated with them. This is my favorite
17:23.200 - 17:29.560:  topic because they're so individual and unique, watching them forge relationships, explore their
17:29.560 - 17:35.180:  environment, learning their light and dislike. It is just amazing to me. So I've enjoyed getting
17:35.180 - 17:39.720:  to know them. They're just completely individual and that's what drew me to them.
17:39.860 - 17:46.040:  And so this should be a nice peaceful retirement, shouldn't it? But extreme weather is becoming an
17:46.040 - 17:52.400:  issue. It's in a particularly cool summer. We've had some storm right at the beginning of the
17:52.400 - 17:56.840:  summer that kind of took us by surprise with their intensity, but then since then we've had
17:57.340 - 18:02.180:  incredibly high temperatures. I mean, multiple days with it over 100. One of the ways that we're
18:02.180 - 18:07.560:  working with the chimps to prepare them for extreme weather is recalled training. And that is the
18:07.560 - 18:13.320:  process of asking the chimps to come inside with a very specific auditory cue. It is very specific
18:13.320 - 18:18.200:  to the growth. Each group has a different sound and we're training them. So when that sound plays,
18:18.200 - 18:23.220:  they know to come inside their bedroom, get reinforced with them popsicles or bananas,
18:23.900 - 18:29.600:  and then they can be locked inside, they've been found. And just to pick up on the different auditory
18:29.600 - 18:35.920:  cues for different groups of chimps, they all have a different tone. They may sound somewhat
18:35.920 - 18:40.520:  similar, but they're all a bit of a chirping noise. We had to kind of scour the internet first
18:40.520 - 18:45.480:  of different ones with so many groups of chimps. And that we have here, one of our more produced
18:45.480 - 18:50.060:  sounds that staff make is a cowbell. So they'll bring the cowbell first specific amount of time.
18:50.560 - 18:53.740:  But from there, we kind of had to store some different auditory cues,
18:54.320 - 19:00.060:  such as like a chirping or like a bicycle horn sound. But we also have a chimper who is deaf. So
19:00.060 - 19:04.500:  with this training involving an auditory cue, we kind of had to get creative since she cannot
19:04.500 - 19:10.220:  hear that cue. So her specific cue is actually visual. We show her my bright orange frisbee,
19:10.680 - 19:15.760:  and that is her pairing with that training. And there was one time specifically that we drove
19:15.760 - 19:21.240:  down to the moat, flashed her that frisbee, and she started booking it right up towards the building.
19:21.240 - 19:27.160:  It was amazing. Jordan Garberino at Chimp Haven. Now some of the other things that we noticed this
19:27.160 - 19:33.480:  week, 16 young activists in Montana won a court case over their rights to a clean and helpful
19:33.480 - 19:38.900:  environment. The state is appealing, but if the judge's decision is upheld, the state will have
19:38.900 - 19:44.020:  to redraft its environmental policies to take climate change into consideration for future
19:44.020 - 19:49.540:  power projects. Ricky Held was the lead plaintiff. We're not blaming every day on tenants,
19:49.540 - 19:56.220:  at all. We're not asking them to throw away their tractor keys. It's not about that. We're asking
19:56.220 - 20:02.040:  our state government who has control over our state energy policies to protect their citizens
20:02.040 - 20:09.220:  and our land and resources. And Ricky says she's ultimately an optimist. Just having the chance
20:09.220 - 20:16.360:  to live and be part of this world is just a reason for our optimism. And it's all a gift.
20:16.940 - 20:20.660:  And I want to give back to this world and make it a better place in any way I can.
20:21.400 - 20:26.620:  Now you might remember that Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark really, really hates snakes.
20:27.060 - 20:33.200:  Well now Harrison Ford, who played Indy, has had a snake named after him. A newfound species in
20:33.200 - 20:40.180:  Peru has been named Taki Menoydi's Harrison Fordi to honour the actor's environmental advocacy.
20:40.180 - 20:45.720:  He already has an aunt and a spider named after him. And the international coin of the year
20:45.720 - 20:51.780:  awards have taken place. The highlight of the new Mismatists calendar with the Royal Australian Mint
20:51.780 - 20:57.640:  taking two top prizes. Best circulating coin went to the $2 honeybee coin, which has a rather
20:57.640 - 21:02.460:  nice sort of golden honeycomb bit in the middle. And the most artistic coin for the 2022
21:02.540 - 21:10.020:  Beauty Rich and Rare Great Barrier Reef. And now to the story of four Australian surfers who were
21:10.020 - 21:16.600:  missing for 36 hours off the Indonesian coast in waters known for being home to several aggressive
21:16.600 - 21:23.400:  species of shark. Stephanie Prentice told us what happened. It was the nightmarish plot twist to
21:23.400 - 21:29.560:  a dream holiday that none of them had expected. A group of friends from Australia enjoying a trip
21:29.560 - 21:35.760:  to celebrate one of them turning 30 was split up by a sudden storm with half of the group left
21:35.760 - 21:41.820:  floating in the sea. The friends had been heading to a remote part of Indonesia to go surfing together,
21:42.360 - 21:47.860:  but when the storm struck it destroyed one of their wooden boats, leaving four of them in a
21:47.860 - 21:53.280:  guide bobbing on their surfboards in waters known for being home to bullsharks, hammerheads,
21:53.280 - 21:59.500:  and even great whites. They had no food, no water, and no way of calling for help.
22:00.220 - 22:05.320:  But they did have a positive attitude. They grouped together on their boards and one of them,
22:05.320 - 22:11.200:  Elliot Foot, volunteered to paddle off alone and look for help. While he was gone, a secondary boat
22:11.200 - 22:16.860:  that survived the storm made it to land and called in rescuers who searched and searched until they
22:16.860 - 22:23.880:  got to the group, 36 hours after they'd gone into the water. A video shows them straddling their
22:23.880 - 22:27.780:  boards in a vast expanse of water, exhilarated to be found.
22:28.480 - 22:31.240:  Yeah! Yeah!
22:35.020 - 22:37.840:  Elliot! Where's Elliot?
22:38.680 - 22:39.960:  There's Ardy, that's Ardy right?
22:39.960 - 22:42.960:  Yeah, do you have Elliot?
22:42.960 - 22:49.140:  They shouted concern for their friend who hadn't been seen for hours, but after another search,
22:49.140 - 22:55.020:  he was found as well, alone and exhausted, close to land but unable to reach it,
22:55.440 - 23:02.580:  he called the rescue miraculous, and despite a bit, well, a lot of sunburn and some grazers,
23:02.580 - 23:07.940:  the group told press they were all fine and ready to continue that once in a lifetime trip.
23:07.940 - 23:12.980:  Stephanie Brent is reporting. Now we know that a great many hospitals and care settings
23:12.980 - 23:18.760:  inviting dogs to help calm and relax patients. Now there's increasing evidence that even brief
23:18.760 - 23:24.940:  period spent with dogs, good dogs anyway, reduces stress hormones and increases oxytocin,
23:24.940 - 23:28.900:  the feel-good hormone, and that can actually have real impact on our health.
23:29.420 - 23:35.440:  Nancy G is a professor of psychiatry and director of the Centre for Human Animal Interaction
23:35.440 - 23:41.260:  of Virginia Commonwealth University. So we know that dogs cheer people up, but what's new with
23:41.260 - 23:48.360:  this research? What our study is showing us is some really measurable improvements from having a
23:48.360 - 23:53.500:  dog visit them in the hospital. People often think of it as kind of a feel-good nice to have,
23:53.980 - 23:58.080:  but what we're finding is that it's actually more than that. It's really delivering
23:58.080 - 24:04.360:  measurable effects to those patients and importantly to healthcare staff. But what if you just
24:04.360 - 24:08.580:  know to a dog person, will you have allergies or something? Is there any other way that you can
24:08.580 - 24:13.480:  get some of these benefits? A study was done at Washington State University where they had university
24:13.480 - 24:18.560:  students interacting with dogs in a library setting, and other students were just standing in line.
24:18.560 - 24:22.860:  So they weren't even interacting with the dog. They were just watching other people interact with
24:22.860 - 24:28.920:  the dog. Their cortisol went down. Their mood went up. So we still see similar effects,
24:29.400 - 24:35.740:  even when the person isn't physically touching the dog. And you've also talked about young people.
24:35.740 - 24:39.660:  Children, you've had short exchanges with dogs in the classroom, haven't you?
24:39.940 - 24:43.600:  Yes, we did a study with researchers at the University of Lincoln in the UK.
24:44.540 - 24:50.220:  And in that study, it was with eight-year-old children. And what we found is that the children
24:50.220 - 24:56.540:  who interacted with the dog had decreases in cortisol. And they had increases in executive
24:56.540 - 25:01.460:  functioning. And it's highly correlated with success in life. So it's interesting because there's
25:01.460 - 25:06.520:  some evidence that interacting with a dog makes us smarter. And the results that you found don't
25:06.520 - 25:11.500:  just relate to the immediate time around interacting with dogs, do they? Some of the results can be
25:11.500 - 25:19.680:  quite long. Some of the findings we're seeing still at a one-month time period. We see the dogs
25:19.680 - 25:24.700:  and we think, wow, this is a great mood boost. It must just be temporary, but it's not. It does
25:24.700 - 25:31.620:  seem to be a bit longer lasting. So the big question would be why? First of all, we need attachment
25:31.620 - 25:39.300:  figures. We need social support. And dogs in particular provide that for us. So we need to care
25:39.300 - 25:45.800:  for another living being. But I think it is even deeper than that. Even when we just interact
25:45.800 - 25:52.180:  with the dog, we see things like blood pressure decreasing and stress decreasing. And it's
25:52.180 - 25:57.900:  possible that this goes back to our long-lasting relationship with animals. Animals through this
25:57.900 - 26:03.840:  process of domestication and selection have become extraordinarily adept at socializing with
26:03.840 - 26:10.640:  humans. They respond to our social cues. They respond to changes in our emotions. So I think
26:10.640 - 26:16.780:  it goes back to we've both learned to read one another and therefore sort of benefit from one
26:16.780 - 26:26.200:  another. That was Professor Nancy G in the US. And that's it from us for now. Remember if you'd
