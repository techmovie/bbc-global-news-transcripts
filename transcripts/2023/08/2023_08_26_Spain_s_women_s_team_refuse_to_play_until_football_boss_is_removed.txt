00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:21.020:  by advertising. That 56 seconds, it took me to swim that gold medal when I looked for that feeling
00:21.020 - 00:28.580:  for 30 years and I never found it. A podcast about the people behind the medals.
00:29.400 - 00:34.620:  On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:37.100 - 00:41.140:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:44.720 - 00:48.880:  I'm Nigel Adely and in the early hours of Saturday the 26th of August,
00:48.880 - 00:55.040:  these are our main stories. Spain's World Cup winning football team have said they won't play
00:55.040 - 01:01.440:  again while Lewis Rabiales remains head of the National Federation. Jenny Humoso has dismissed
01:01.440 - 01:07.040:  his claim that the kiss he gave at the final was consensual. Hawaii has published the names
01:07.040 - 01:13.420:  of almost 400 people who've been missing since wildfire swept Maui Island and the director of
01:13.420 - 01:17.480:  the British Museum is stepping down after a series of thefts from its collection.
01:20.420 - 01:25.960:  Also in this podcast, the recently published police mugshot of Donald Trump has been given a
01:25.960 - 01:31.820:  new life of its own by social media users around the world. There's one of an orange and yellow
01:31.820 - 01:36.940:  boxing glove which very effectively stands in for Mr. Trump who was obviously in fighting mood,
01:37.480 - 01:41.660:  but he's also been seen in green and red and there he's the Joker.
01:45.680 - 01:50.840:  Spain's World Cup winning football team have said they won't play again while Lewis Rabiales
01:50.840 - 01:56.800:  remains head of the National Federation. He's been resisting pressure to resign over the kiss
01:56.800 - 02:03.220:  on the lips he gave to the player Jenny Humoso at the final on Sunday. She says his claim that it
02:03.220 - 02:08.640:  was consensual is categorically false and that she felt like a victim of aggression.
02:09.440 - 02:15.240:  The Spanish government has begun a legal process against Mr. Rabiales to try and force him out.
02:15.980 - 02:22.920:  Key sponsors, including the airline Iberia, have also called for action. Guy Hedgeko reports from
02:22.920 - 02:33.220:  Madrid. No, not the words, nor indeed the tone of a contract boss tendering his resignation.
02:33.260 - 02:38.900:  It had been widely reported that Lewis Rabiales would step down as an extraordinary meeting of
02:38.900 - 02:45.200:  the Football Federation. But no, when he grabbed Jenny Humoso and kissed her after the World Cup
02:45.200 - 02:51.380:  final, said Mr. Rabiales, it was with her consent. He compared it to the kisses he gives his daughters.
02:52.300 - 02:55.960:  Then he turned on his critics, accusing them of false feminism.
02:57.660 - 03:01.340:  Do you think it's so severe that I should leave having delivered the best
03:01.340 - 03:04.760:  management in the history of Spanish football? Do you think I should resign?
03:04.760 - 03:10.240:  Well, I'm going to tell you all something. I'm not going to resign. I'm not going to resign.
03:15.660 - 03:17.940:  Mr. Rabiales has been under fire all week.
03:19.340 - 03:25.300:  Misedemoso herself had said the kiss was not welcome and an array of public figures,
03:25.740 - 03:30.100:  including government ministers, had said the Federation President should be punished for his
03:30.100 - 03:35.780:  actions. The head of Spain's top La Liga division accused him of being arrogant and cocky and
03:35.780 - 03:41.080:  playing the victim. World football's governing body, FIFA, opened disciplinary proceedings against
03:41.080 - 03:47.340:  Mr. Rabiales, appearing to make his position untenable. His actions have overshadowed the Spanish
03:47.340 - 03:54.320:  women's World Cup win, but Mr. Rabiales remains defiant. Although he did apologise for grabbing his
03:54.320 - 04:00.100:  crutch when celebrating the team's victory as the queen and her daughter sat a few feet away.
04:00.820 - 04:05.380:  In a news conference, the government said it would be taking action to force Mr. Rabiales
04:05.380 - 04:10.400:  out of office and describe this as Spanish football's me-to-moment.
04:10.740 - 04:14.840:  There are also signs of a revolt against him among female and male players.
04:15.460 - 04:21.140:  The striker, Bordeche Iglesias, has promised not to play for the national team until the Federation
04:21.140 - 04:26.220:  Boss is replaced. In a country where people are often more tactile in social situations
04:26.220 - 04:33.320:  than northern Europeans, the scale of the backlash suggests Mr. Rabiales went way too far.
04:34.080 - 04:34.900:  Guy Hedgeko
04:35.900 - 04:41.220:  The authorities in the US state of Hawaii have published the names of almost 400 people
04:41.740 - 04:46.020:  who've been missing since wildfires swept the island of Maui earlier this month.
04:46.720 - 04:51.320:  They want any survivors on the list to come forward so the number of people unaccounted
04:51.320 - 04:56.680:  for can be reduced. The appeal came from the Maui Police Chief John Poletier.
04:57.420 - 05:04.260:  If you're on this list, please contact the FBI number provided. If you know the person is safe,
05:04.260 - 05:14.020:  please contact the FBI number provided or email MPD at unaccounted at MPD.net. We need your help
05:14.540 - 05:20.340:  now and each and every day because we're only going to get through this if we're working together
05:20.340 - 05:26.240:  as one. Teams are still searching the charred remains of the historic town of Lahaina and other
05:26.240 - 05:33.440:  areas. 115 people are known to have died. I spoke to our correspondent Gary O'Donohue
05:33.440 - 05:38.680:  in Washington and asked him about the latest information released by the Hawaiian authorities.
05:39.540 - 05:46.080:  So there's a list of 388 names. The reason they've done this is because they originally talked about
05:46.140 - 05:51.680:  perhaps you know 1100 people missing but that list they had then was incomplete. It was just some
05:51.680 - 05:56.160:  it was just first name, some of it with duplicates. There was a lot of pressure on them to come up
05:56.160 - 06:01.140:  with something more definitive. So this is a list with full names where they've had verification
06:01.140 - 06:06.440:  from people who are still alive that these people are missing and they're hoping this is going to
06:06.440 - 06:11.000:  be going to enable them to be a bit more accurate about what they're looking for in terms of
06:11.000 - 06:15.280:  human remains in particular but they're also hoping it will mean some people can come forward and say
06:15.280 - 06:19.840:  no actually this person is still alive so to take down the number of total missing.
06:20.200 - 06:25.020:  And the fires occurred over two weeks ago now. Why's it taken so long to establish these numbers?
06:25.380 - 06:29.420:  I think partly the response I mean which has been criticised, the emergency response has been
06:29.420 - 06:34.160:  severely criticised anyway. That's been part of the problem. Apparently according to the police
06:34.160 - 06:40.100:  has been some reluctance from people to give DNA samples that would allow them also to identify
06:40.100 - 06:46.460:  some of the remains there finding and the the clear up is still in Lahaina particularly the town
06:46.460 - 06:51.980:  that was really jumping burnt to the ground that is still going on so the rescue teams are still
06:51.980 - 06:57.600:  working through that so all those things I think is the reason it's taking some time and I mean
06:57.600 - 07:02.600:  to remember the scale of this was this is the biggest wildfire in terms of casualties in more than
07:02.600 - 07:08.620:  a hundred years in the US and this is an island that's you know hours off the coast of California
07:09.320 - 07:13.740:  getting support there has been tricky I think. The lawsuit has been filed against a local power
07:13.740 - 07:18.620:  company. What do we know about that? Yeah another lawsuit this is not the first and it may not be
07:18.620 - 07:23.840:  the last because there's a class action going on that the shareholders of Hawaiian Electric have
07:23.840 - 07:28.240:  also filed a lawsuit. This one is from the local county saying that the the company should have
07:28.240 - 07:33.340:  shut down the power grid when it received warnings that downed power lines could spark wildfires
07:33.420 - 07:38.100:  and they said it didn't do that the company rejects that and says this is far too soon for the
07:38.100 - 07:42.880:  lawsuits and that the inquiry should be allowed to carry on go through its its course before any
07:42.880 - 07:49.460:  blame is attributed. Gary O'Donohue in Washington the Russian authorities say they have recovered
07:49.460 - 07:55.280:  10 bodies and flight recorders from the site we have gaining precautions private playing crashed
07:55.280 - 08:00.640:  two days ago they added that tests will be carried out to identify the victims.
08:01.720 - 08:07.400:  The plane crashed exactly two months after the Wagner paramilitary boss led a short-lived rebellion.
08:08.260 - 08:15.360:  The Kremlin has denied ordering Mr. Progoshin's death describing such speculation as a complete lie
08:16.200 - 08:21.740:  will Vernon reports from Moscow. Two days after the plane crash many Russians are convinced
08:21.740 - 08:28.540:  that the Kremlin may have been involved. A number of Western officials including U.S. President Joe Biden
08:29.080 - 08:33.060:  have also suggested that Russian authorities might be linked to the incidents.
08:36.960 - 08:41.980:  Today President Putin's spokesman held one of his regular conference calls with Moscow-based
08:41.980 - 08:51.460:  journalists. On the call I asked to meet you Peskov what was his reaction to these allegations.
08:56.060 - 09:02.640:  It's all a complete lie. Of course when we talk about this issue we should be guided only by fact.
09:02.780 - 09:09.120:  We don't have many facts at the moment. The facts need to be clarified during the official
09:09.120 - 09:15.120:  investigation which is being carried out now. A clear denial from the Kremlin spokesman
09:15.520 - 09:20.820:  but it is unlikely that will convince many people at home and abroad. The Kremlin has been
09:20.820 - 09:26.180:  accused of a whole host of dirty tricks in recent years from poisonings and assassinations
09:26.180 - 09:33.420:  to organizing coups and committing war crimes. Every time the tactic is the same the Kremlin denies
09:33.420 - 09:38.700:  it all. It was only a year and a half ago that accusations were levelled at Vladimir Putin
09:38.700 - 09:44.560:  over a build up of troops on the border with Ukraine. Russia it was said was preparing to invade
09:45.180 - 09:52.220:  what was the Kremlin's response to that? Not us. Vladimir Putin's spokesman was also asked today
09:52.680 - 09:56.440:  whether the Russian leader would consider attending Yefgeny Pregorgian's funeral.
09:56.460 - 10:03.380:  It's too early to talk about this, said Mr Peskov. But also the president is very busy at the moment.
10:04.140 - 10:09.840:  Will Vernon. The Dutch beer maker Heineken has sold off its Russian business to a local company
10:09.840 - 10:16.680:  for just one euro. Many Western firms ended their operations in Russia when it invaded Ukraine
10:16.680 - 10:24.840:  last year. The deal will leave Heineken with a loss of around $325 million. Our business correspondent
10:24.840 - 10:30.480:  Derval Jordan reports. It has taken Heineken nearly a year and a half to exit Russia.
10:31.180 - 10:35.460:  The Brune giant promise it would leave shortly after the Kremlin launched its invasion of
10:35.460 - 10:41.000:  Ukraine last February. At the time many Western companies said they would stop doing business in
10:41.000 - 10:47.100:  Russia. Some household names such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola initially failed to take action
10:47.520 - 10:53.320:  but poured out a mid-growing call for a boycott. Heineken stopped selling the brand in Russia last
10:53.400 - 10:59.940:  year and had ring fence local business so it was self-funding. But it has said that getting out of
10:59.940 - 11:05.460:  the country completely has been complicated. Other firms have recently faced difficulties.
11:05.660 - 11:11.380:  The Brune group Karlsburg and the French yoghurt maker Denome have had their assets seized by
11:11.380 - 11:17.600:  the state. Heineken will now transfer seven breweries in Russia to Arnest Group, a local firm
11:17.600 - 11:24.760:  which makes aerosol cans. Arnest will also take on 1,800 Heineken staff with their employment
11:24.760 - 11:31.680:  guaranteed for three years. Denome is proposing to ban the burning of holy books after a series of
11:31.680 - 11:37.560:  incidents involving the Koran which have led to anger and protests among Muslims. The ban
11:37.560 - 11:43.080:  would also protect religious symbols like crucifixes but only be applied to public places
11:43.820 - 11:50.060:  and to broadcasting such actions to a wider audience. The Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard
11:50.420 - 11:56.020:  said the bill would continue to protect freedom of speech. The government will therefore
11:56.020 - 12:00.000:  bring forward a bill which prohibits inappropriate treatment of objects that have
12:00.000 - 12:04.700:  important significance for a religious community. The bill will not change how people can express
12:04.700 - 12:09.420:  themselves verbally or in writing regarding religious topics. This means that, for example,
12:09.420 - 12:14.300:  satirical drawings will not be covered so there will be a very broad framework for freedom
12:14.300 - 12:20.980:  of expression. Tim Franksert, more from Richard Mill, the financial times Nordic and Baltic
12:20.980 - 12:26.460:  correspondent who's in Oslo. The government has proposed banning the inappropriate
12:26.460 - 12:33.000:  treatments of objects with significant religious significance. Now this is as you mentioned
12:33.000 - 12:39.980:  really centered around the Koran but it's obviously broader than that would have taken the Torah
12:39.980 - 12:46.440:  and the Bible which have also been burned in Copenhagen in recent weeks but nothing like much as
12:46.480 - 12:53.160:  the Koran and it's really quite vague as you can hear so it's not exactly known just how far
12:53.160 - 12:59.020:  it will go and Denmark is a country with very proud free speech traditions so there's also
12:59.020 - 13:05.800:  a lot of worry as to what this might mean and might end up prosecuting. Right okay so lots of
13:05.800 - 13:11.020:  questions about sort of which religious texts and objects and sort of what counts as
13:11.020 - 13:18.660:  desecration as well I guess. Absolutely the minister said soiling the texts or crampling upon them
13:18.660 - 13:25.140:  and I think he said you know the your fantasy is the limit you know and this this causes concern
13:25.140 - 13:32.140:  because you see it in other countries as well that broad public order legislation can be used to
13:32.140 - 13:38.840:  stop quite a lot of demonstrations Denmark has a very proud tradition they've also faced pressure
13:38.840 - 13:44.320:  from the Muslim world before and I mean it's similar questions of course are being asked in Sweden
13:44.320 - 13:51.480:  where they've been Koran burning as well and Sweden you know there's the extra factor of wanting
13:51.480 - 13:58.040:  to overcome Turkish considerable Turkish opposition to its membership of NATO. Do you think this is
13:58.040 - 14:03.420:  likely to change the debate there? The Swedish government is perhaps in a tie to bind because
14:03.420 - 14:09.280:  the protection of free speech is even stronger there the police in several cases this year have
14:09.280 - 14:16.460:  banned the burning of the Koran only for the court to overturn those bans and say that unless
14:16.520 - 14:22.940:  there's an immediate threat to public safety they have to go ahead so the government there is looking
14:23.680 - 14:28.180:  something similar to this but I think it's going to be tougher for them. Richard Mill the financial
14:28.180 - 14:35.980:  times correspondent in Oslo the director of the British Museum Hartwig Fisher is stepping down over
14:35.980 - 14:41.880:  the theft of artifacts from its collection he had been due to leave next year but says his
14:41.880 - 14:49.240:  continued presence will be a distraction at a moment of utmost seriousness. Mr Fisher has also
14:49.240 - 14:55.660:  withdrawn remarks he made about a Dutch dealer in antiquities Itai Gradel who said he'd alerted
14:55.660 - 15:01.680:  the museum about potential wrongdoing two years ago. Here's our culture editor Katie Razzle.
15:02.720 - 15:08.360:  Only days ago Hartwig Fisher was sticking to the line that although Dr Itai Gradel had contacted
15:08.360 - 15:14.600:  the British Museum in 2021 flagging that thefts were taking place and investigation by the museum
15:14.600 - 15:20.380:  had found nothing untoward. He even suggested that Dr Gradel had been less than candid with the museum
15:20.780 - 15:25.620:  and had not revealed details of potentially stolen items in his possession that would have aided
15:25.620 - 15:32.020:  the investigation but emails shown first to the BBC earlier this week between Dr Gradel and the
15:32.020 - 15:37.600:  museum directorate make clear that Dr Gradel had raised the fact that he may have inadvertently
15:37.600 - 15:43.280:  bought items online which could have been part of the museum collection. He says in his efforts to
15:43.280 - 15:48.660:  let them know his fears that items were being removed by a member of museum staff he had always
15:48.660 - 15:55.040:  acted in good faith. He needed to go because he is ultimately responsible for a cataclysmic
15:55.040 - 16:00.860:  disaster that has hit the British Museum. I'm not talking of the thefts but of the utterly
16:00.860 - 16:07.560:  bungled incompetent way the management dealt with this their failure to take my one seriously they
16:07.560 - 16:13.960:  refused to listen they never contacted me for any additional information or assistance it is
16:13.960 - 16:19.060:  unbelievable what what happens here. Dr Fisher has now apologized for his remarks about Dr
16:19.060 - 16:24.080:  Gradel and has admitted that the museum did not respond as it should have when he warned them of
16:24.080 - 16:29.820:  the potential scandal two years ago. It's believed more than 1500 items of gold jewellery,
16:29.820 - 16:36.040:  semi-precious stone and glass some of which date back to the 15th century BC have been stolen,
16:36.040 - 16:40.280:  damaged or missing from the collection and that the issues date back several years.
16:41.180 - 16:46.800:  Katie Razzle on Thursday British police announced that a man had been questioned in connection with
16:46.800 - 16:54.660:  the thefts. Still to come one of the best known chains of wine shops in France recently around
16:54.660 - 17:00.140:  an advertising campaign with the slogan we don't just sell wine they'd recently begun devoting
17:00.140 - 17:05.560:  a large part of their floor space to beers. There's growing concern about the overproduction of
17:05.560 - 17:09.740:  French wine as drinking habits change at home and abroad.
17:14.760 - 17:19.100:  From their battles on the world stage I gave everything for that race and I was able to come
17:19.100 - 17:23.480:  away with something that like I've dreamed about since I was a kid to their battles behind close
17:23.480 - 17:29.320:  doors. I had to reach some terrible bottoms in my addiction and suffer some really terrible
17:29.320 - 17:34.180:  consequences and suffer a lot of loss due to my drinking to get to where I am today.
17:35.360 - 17:39.940:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympians and Paralympians share their stories.
17:39.940 - 17:44.960:  On the podium from the BBC World Service find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
17:46.040 - 17:52.900:  Now back to the global news podcast. State media in Somalia are reporting that the army has recaptured
17:53.280 - 18:00.400:  a major stronghold of the Islamic militant group Al-Shabab. The town El-Bur is in central Somalia
18:00.940 - 18:05.640:  and has been in the hands of the militants for years. I heard more from our Africa regional
18:05.640 - 18:11.580:  editor Will Ross, who's in Nairobi. The government will be keen to paint it as a major
18:12.200 - 18:17.200:  victory. This was sort of one of certainly two major towns that it was hoping to take
18:17.260 - 18:26.720:  during this latest offensive, this new offensive. El-Bur had been held by Al-Shabab since 2017
18:26.820 - 18:31.860:  and there had been some fighting in the villages surrounding it, but we understand there
18:31.860 - 18:38.300:  wasn't a great deal of fighting for the final seizure of the town and that's possibly a sign
18:38.300 - 18:45.800:  that the jihadist fighters didn't want a kind of full-on battle against its enemy, the government
18:45.800 - 18:51.700:  forces. So it seems to have withdrawn and it's quite possible that many of those fighters simply
18:52.220 - 18:58.440:  took off their military uniforms and melted away, but it is significant in that it's happened
18:58.440 - 19:04.440:  pretty quickly and it's another sign of the kind of success that the government seems to have
19:04.440 - 19:09.460:  when it's working with local clan militias and that's what happened since the middle of
19:09.460 - 19:14.300:  last year really. They took on a kind of new way of fighting Al-Shabab by working with local
19:14.300 - 19:20.360:  clan militias who were very invested in trying to defeat Al-Shabab. I'm the Somali President
19:20.360 - 19:24.500:  has announced that we'll be a major offensive, so is this only the start?
19:24.840 - 19:28.280:  This is the start, we don't know how long it's going to go on, but he certainly made some
19:28.280 - 19:34.280:  pretty lofty promises this week talking about defeating the group within a matter of months,
19:34.280 - 19:41.400:  he said, five months, and it's quite possible that a lot of towns and villages will be taken
19:41.400 - 19:48.220:  from Al-Shabab, but that's very different from defeating this extremist jihadist group which
19:48.720 - 19:54.740:  has its tentacles kind of deeply rooted in Somali society, it's got very sophisticated
19:54.940 - 20:02.160:  intelligence network sorted out with spies almost everywhere including right across the capital
20:02.160 - 20:08.420:  Mogadishu and penetrating into government institutions including into the security sector,
20:08.880 - 20:14.600:  so that makes it incredibly difficult for the government and the military to stay one step ahead
20:14.600 - 20:18.860:  of the jihadists and what it has done in the past is it's tend to sort of alter its tactics
20:18.860 - 20:24.360:  withdraw from places when they're a large offensive and then come back in a different form
20:24.360 - 20:30.480:  in different areas and one of the things that is just extraordinary in terms of its power and
20:30.480 - 20:36.860:  influence in the country, it basically has an extortion racket or it would call it a tax where
20:36.860 - 20:44.080:  businesses right across the country and even across the region are forced to pay this tax or this
20:44.080 - 20:50.620:  money to Al-Shabab so that's how it raises a lot of funds and people are so afraid of being punished
20:50.620 - 20:56.360:  or attacked by the group which has proved that it could still carry out bomb and gun attacks against
20:56.360 - 21:02.760:  individual targets, it is a very difficult group to take on and that's why there have been some
21:02.760 - 21:10.360:  people saying maybe a military solution isn't the answer. Will Ross, this week Cambodia got its
21:10.360 - 21:17.160:  first new prime minister for nearly 40 years. The country has moved on significantly since the
21:17.160 - 21:24.580:  terrible slaughter carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s, but most of it's 17 million
21:24.580 - 21:33.040:  people have only known one leader, Hun Sen. He has outsmarted, intimidated and bought half his
21:33.040 - 21:39.800:  opponents to build a one-party, one-man rule and the person he's handing power to is his son.
21:40.720 - 21:46.380:  Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head reports on how this remarkable political survivor
21:47.000 - 21:57.580:  has shaped the country. A military band welcomes Cambodia's king for the state opening of Parliament,
21:58.500 - 22:04.780:  but both the monarch and the elected assembly are little more than ceremonial. Real power lies with
22:04.780 - 22:12.340:  a pudgy, bespectacled man in a formal white jacket lining up to greet the king. Hun Sen has ruled
22:12.340 - 22:19.260:  Cambodia since the time when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were in office. Now he's handing over
22:19.260 - 22:30.360:  to his son Hun Manet. In a tearful farewell speech Hun Sen said he'd given up his life to bring
22:30.360 - 22:36.600:  peace to the Cambodian people. He also warned that he wasn't leaving politics yet. He still keeps
22:36.600 - 22:46.980:  several influential positions. Not far outside Pnom Penh, guides still take tourists around Chung
22:46.980 - 22:56.060:  Egg. One of the notorious killing fields where in the 1970s the fanatical Khmer Rouge revolutionaries
22:56.060 - 23:03.600:  executed their victims. Hun Sen has always claimed his legitimacy from leading Cambodia from that terrible
23:03.600 - 23:11.620:  period to the peace and prosperity it enjoys today. Sebastian Strangio has written what is perhaps
23:11.620 - 23:17.940:  the definitive book on Hun Sen's Cambodia. The system is inherently unstable. It's not rooted in any
23:17.940 - 23:25.860:  institutions that relies on keeping powerful people contented. Hun Sen's political genius, if one
23:25.860 - 23:31.720:  could term it such, was to anticipate sources of opposition from within his own party and to
23:31.720 - 23:39.120:  essentially buy them off. And this is from the sale and extraction of Cambodia's natural resources
23:39.120 - 23:42.240:  that have in many cases had a very negative effect on the Cambodian people.
23:47.920 - 23:52.660:  In a backstreet bar, Wattiganiva runs through one of the songs that earned her the moniker
23:52.660 - 23:59.800:  Queen of Cambodian punk. Her generation, born long after the Khmer Rouge, cares much more about
23:59.800 - 24:04.980:  the stark inequality and environmental destruction they've witnessed in the Hun Sen era.
24:06.520 - 24:11.660:  The big problem for me is just the environment. Right now they destroy more a lot of trees
24:12.840 - 24:18.460:  and more building coming up. Before you have more quiet place, beautiful place, but right now when
24:18.460 - 24:23.880:  we know that this beautiful place people just come and building something on that place to make
24:23.880 - 24:29.640:  their own money. One of the beautiful places Wattiganiva was talking about his bottom sack or national
24:29.640 - 24:34.220:  park with forested mountains tumbling down to a pristine coast.
24:36.400 - 24:42.800:  But these days much of it is a building site. These luxury villas going up next to a neo-vanician
24:42.800 - 24:49.480:  casino aimed at Chinese tourists. Around 80% of the park has already been allocated to
24:49.480 - 24:53.880:  favored companies for development. Thousands of people have been evicted.
24:56.460 - 24:57.820:  One of them is Somme T.
25:07.420 - 25:11.240:  It brings tears to my eyes to see it like this Somme T told me.
25:11.740 - 25:16.320:  There used to be more than 30 families living here. Now it's all overgrown.
25:17.680 - 25:23.100:  Cambodia has one of the world's highest rates of deforestation. Land disputes are an
25:23.100 - 25:28.860:  unquenchable source of public anger as is the huge gap between the extraordinary wealth acquired
25:28.860 - 25:34.620:  by Hun Sen and his allies and the rest of the country. It's this toxic legacy that is
25:34.760 - 25:37.580:  inexperienced son will now have to manage.
25:39.200 - 25:46.320:  Jonathan Head in Cambodia. Next to France and the government is setting aside over 200 million
25:46.320 - 25:53.660:  dollars to compensate wine growers for destroying surplus stocks. The move is a reaction to growing
25:53.660 - 25:59.440:  concern about the overproduction of French wine, as drinking habits change at home and abroad.
25:59.580 - 26:06.260:  Hugh Skullford reports from Sonse in central France. One of the best known chains of wine shops in
26:06.260 - 26:11.060:  France recently ran an advertising campaign with the slogan, we didn't just sell wine.
26:11.060 - 26:15.900:  It was true. They'd recently begun devoting a large part of their floor space to beers.
26:15.900 - 26:20.580:  It's the same in supermarkets where once there were rows of different wines of all
26:20.580 - 26:26.600:  hues and prices, now the grape is seriously challenged by the grain. It's an old fixation,
26:26.600 - 26:31.760:  of course. In France, the decline in domestic wine consumption goes back decades. The problem is
26:31.760 - 26:37.600:  it never goes into reverse. And today's young generations are increasingly tempted by craft beers,
26:38.040 - 26:43.040:  marketed with all the attention to tradition and local conditions and know how that have so long
26:43.040 - 26:49.060:  been associated with wine. Here in Sonse, home to the wonderful flinty sovenure whites,
26:49.620 - 26:52.780:  the latest addition to the food and drink scene is a blury.
26:53.600 - 27:00.360:  Hugh Skullfield. More and more of us are enjoying live music, both at big stadium concerts and
27:00.360 - 27:08.460:  music festivals, as popularity grows worldwide, so are the emissions. Jordan Dunbar from the BBC's
27:08.460 - 27:13.940:  Climate Question Podcast has been taking a look at the problem and sounding out some solutions.
27:19.980 - 27:24.660:  The way to make money in the music industry has changed. Now you make more money from touring
27:24.660 - 27:30.400:  and playing live rather than releasing songs. So globally, the number of festivals and artist
27:30.400 - 27:34.500:  tours are increasing and that means the emissions they create are increasing too.
27:35.640 - 27:44.780:  I would say 75% of the weekends you own the road. I have very few weekends at home. Ben Paul is an
27:44.780 - 27:49.240:  Afrobeat's musician from Tanzania who knows all about the growth in live music.
27:49.800 - 27:56.920:  Yeah, there's a huge change. There's so much into a country festival. So many Kenyan artists
27:56.920 - 28:01.860:  coming to perform in Tanzania, the stadiums. And also you would see so many Tanzanian artists
28:03.360 - 28:11.100:  not just Nairobi, but also to Kisumu, to even to the like small cities as well. So there's
28:11.140 - 28:19.900:  also Congo, also Mozambique. So there has been a big change and big growth compared to before.
28:21.260 - 28:26.420:  The Tendell Centre for Climate Research in the UK looked at where emissions might be coming from.
28:27.040 - 28:31.500:  Professor Colin McLaughlin. The first really key principle is the number of people
28:31.500 - 28:36.760:  and how you move them about. We've found that you get like about an 85% reduction in emissions
28:36.760 - 28:42.860:  by going for the real preference across Europe instead of the fly preference. The second one
28:42.860 - 28:47.620:  is about energy consumption at venues. So how energy efficient is the kit that you're using
28:48.000 - 28:50.080:  and then how are you supplying that energy as well?
28:50.760 - 28:56.140:  How we travel as fans to concerts is one of the biggest contributors to the emissions of climate
28:56.140 - 29:04.080:  change in gases. Aviation can really skew things. If you have a gig that's attended by lots of
29:04.080 - 29:09.840:  international fans who have flown into the show, they really dwarf the emissions of local people
29:09.840 - 29:16.340:  traveling. Artists traveling to us at smaller local venues instead of us traveling to them
29:16.340 - 29:22.500:  is actually better for the climate. At music festivals, audience travel makes up even more of
29:22.500 - 29:28.320:  the climate warming emissions up to 80%. One of the world's largest bands called Play played
29:28.320 - 29:34.840:  to a whopping 6.3 million fans on their last tour, but they announced it would be their
29:34.840 - 29:40.940:  greenest yet. Luke Hyle is head of sustainability for the band and he says they've used a range of
29:40.940 - 29:46.020:  nudges on a smartphone app to change fans travel habits. The app will tell you what the impact
29:46.020 - 29:50.180:  of your travel is going to be with the hope that you'll make a choice to bring it down and just
29:50.180 - 29:55.180:  engagement and education has made a difference to it in a lot of cases. They'll incentivise
29:55.180 - 30:01.220:  the low carbon mode of transport to try to make it more appealing to people. Luke says that the
30:01.220 - 30:07.400:  solutions they've put in place have slashed emissions by 47%. But that relies on cities having
30:07.400 - 30:13.120:  good public transport networks, something that's out of the hands of pop stars. There is another
30:13.120 - 30:19.040:  thought. One that makes the growth in live music an opportunity rather than a climate problem.
30:19.940 - 30:25.540:  musician Ben Paul uses his platform to try and edge get fans on climate projects and impacts.
30:26.280 - 30:34.600:  I have over 5.5 million followers all around, so even one post can make a change, can contribute.
30:35.400 - 30:42.340:  So through social media and also traditional media interviews talking about it, influencing
30:42.540 - 30:52.320:  even a single message at my concert can do something. So for me it's using those platforms to
30:52.320 - 30:56.280:  remind the public about the impacts of climate change.
31:01.060 - 31:06.580:  The Afrobeat star Ben Paul, end of your map report from Jordan Dunbar. And you can hear more
31:06.580 - 31:11.020:  on the climate question podcast, search for it on BBC Sounds.
31:12.560 - 31:17.460:  As we heard in the earlier podcast, the biggest thing that came out of former US President
31:17.460 - 31:22.400:  Donald Trump's latest encounter with the law seems to have been his mug shot.
31:23.300 - 31:30.300:  The long anticipated image instantly went viral, not least because Mr Trump himself posted it
31:30.460 - 31:34.960:  on social media. Terry Egan has been looking at the reaction to it online.
31:35.860 - 31:42.400:  Crowds queuing up to see the mug shot, one person using dozens of smartphones so as not to miss one
31:42.400 - 31:48.720:  Iota of it. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton staring intently at it from a war room,
31:48.720 - 31:55.220:  Alla at the death of Bin Laden. Just some of the ways Donald Trump's face is being depicted.
31:55.840 - 32:00.460:  Why has it made such an impact? Well, here's one view from Vanessa Friedman,
32:00.500 - 32:05.380:  fashion editor of The New York Times. It was clearly a picture that had been
32:05.380 - 32:12.960:  considered calculated planned for his expression like leaps out of the frame. He's got his head down,
32:13.760 - 32:20.540:  his eyes are kind of glouring out from under his brows. He's not smiling. He looks very defiant.
32:20.540 - 32:25.640:  He looks like he wants to headbutt the camp. One image places Mr Trump side by side with
32:25.640 - 32:31.060:  Ben Stiller's puckering character from the film Zoolander, looking campily intense.
32:31.820 - 32:37.600:  Others reference maniacal characters out of Stanley Kubrick films, Malcolm McDowell in a
32:37.600 - 32:44.980:  clockwork orange, Jack Nicholson in the shining, even private pile in full metal jacket who goes crazy.
32:45.860 - 32:51.700:  And there's one of the images as Trump's official White House portrait in the process of being hung
32:51.700 - 32:58.800:  up. Many actors and celebrities have wound up the same way Hugh Grant, O.J. Simpson, Mick Jagger are
32:58.800 - 33:06.420:  just some. But this shot of Mr Trump's mug is already ending up on mugs as well as t-shirts
33:06.420 - 33:13.860:  and bumper stickers. Merchandise from Mr Trump himself as well as others. And we'll be seeing it
33:14.200 - 33:17.720:  for quite a while yet. Terry Egan reporting.
33:20.960 - 33:26.280:  And that's all for us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
33:26.980 - 33:31.680:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
