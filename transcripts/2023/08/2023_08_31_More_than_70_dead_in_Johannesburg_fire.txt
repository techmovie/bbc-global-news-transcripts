00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news 7 days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:12.640:  by advertising.
00:16.020 - 00:20.020:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
00:20.160 - 00:26.080:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they made
00:26.080 - 00:30.340:  their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
00:30.480 - 00:35.700:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos really
00:35.700 - 00:40.780:  did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars, listen to Good Bad
00:40.780 - 00:45.660:  Billionaire with me Simon Jack, and me Zingsing, available now wherever you get your podcasts.
00:48.940 - 00:51.480:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:53.840 - 00:58.480:  I'm Nick Miles, and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday, the 31st of August, these are our main stories.
00:58.480 - 01:03.760:  We hear from South Africa where more than 70 people have died in a building fire in central
01:03.760 - 01:09.900:  Johannesburg. It is a said they indeed is a high chance that the numbers might still increase.
01:10.360 - 01:14.640:  And after Harika Nidalia, we look at the huge clear-up that lies ahead.
01:17.660 - 01:22.520:  Also in this podcast, there are further signs that the Chinese economy is continuing to struggle,
01:22.960 - 01:27.680:  and we find out how a team of online love scammers was brought down in Indonesia.
01:31.560 - 01:37.600:  A fire that raged through a five-story building in central Johannesburg in South Africa has left
01:37.600 - 01:42.340:  more than 70 people dead. The loss of life, though, seems to have been made much worse,
01:42.940 - 01:47.000:  because residents couldn't get through a lot gate. Kenny Boopay saw what happened.
01:58.200 - 02:03.660:  This was a building that had been taken over or hijacked by gangs and then rented out to hundreds
02:03.660 - 02:09.580:  of people, most of them homeless migrants. Liber gang Miley is a housing official for the city.
02:09.900 - 02:16.660:  This is a tragedy of monumental proportions, and it's unfortunate that today we are here,
02:17.140 - 02:26.400:  and this for us demonstrate a chronic problem of housing in our province, as we have previously
02:26.400 - 02:34.060:  said, that there's at least 1.2 million people who need housing in our province.
02:34.760 - 02:38.020:  Pumsar Filani are correspondent in Johannesburg told me the latest.
02:38.400 - 02:44.400:  The authorities have been at pains to explain why even such a building exists and why so many
02:44.400 - 02:49.300:  people were left to live in such conditions. It's been described here as a hijacked building,
02:49.300 - 02:54.660:  which basically means it's a building that was condemned by its owners and declared unsafe.
02:54.660 - 02:59.720:  But what has subsequently happened is that it was, it's understood it was taken over by
02:59.720 - 03:05.240:  so-called property cartels that are said to be operating in the city centre and they've been
03:05.240 - 03:10.880:  then renting it out to scores of people per room, charging sometimes exorbitant amounts
03:10.880 - 03:17.100:  for a very small size room and often cramming as much as 10 people in a room that's only big
03:17.100 - 03:23.020:  enough to host two people. And this then makes sort of helps you understand why it's been difficult
03:23.020 - 03:29.060:  for the rest of your even recovery mission to go ahead at speed because authorities have told us
03:29.060 - 03:34.640:  that when they got into the building they found shack-like petitions inside the building,
03:34.640 - 03:40.020:  sometimes even in the basement, making movement very difficult so you can imagine
03:40.440 - 03:46.140:  that when this fire started around 130 in the morning a lot of people would have woken up and
03:46.140 - 03:51.980:  tried to run to the nearest exit and struggled to get out from those various exits.
03:52.420 - 03:58.120:  It's also created questions then around what the housing crisis that has been seen in cities
03:58.120 - 04:04.260:  like Johannesburg which often attract economic migrants from neighboring countries but also people
04:04.260 - 04:09.280:  from poorer parts of South Africa and how when they get to Johannesburg they are often
04:09.620 - 04:16.880:  left to sort of find accommodation in such buildings and without any monitoring from the authorities.
04:16.880 - 04:21.560:  So it's creating some really difficult questions for the authorities to answer but also for the
04:21.560 - 04:27.260:  families who have fallen victim to this who want answers and who want help but also want to know
04:27.260 - 04:34.280:  what has to happen to them now. That was Pumza Filani. To Gabon now where the new transitional leader,
04:34.280 - 04:40.920:  General Bruce Uligay and Gamer, has defended the move to oust the country's long-standing leader
04:40.920 - 04:46.800:  and take power. Wednesday's military coup saw the removal of President Ali Bongo who, along with
04:46.800 - 04:52.560:  his father, had ruled the African state for more than half a century. Camille Epembea is an
04:52.560 - 04:57.520:  entrepreneur and independent politician. Speaking to the BBC, he expressed hope that General
04:57.520 - 05:03.420:  and Gamer's rule would be a stepping stone to a more democratic country. We believe things should
05:03.420 - 05:09.460:  be done step by step. The first step was removing the Bongo family and the political party would
05:09.460 - 05:15.200:  be in there for almost 60 years. If it's a military guy close to them, we don't mind. We are
05:15.200 - 05:19.980:  just concerned about the fact it's a military because we don't want them to stay there forever.
05:20.640 - 05:26.460:  If he can help in transitioning to a real democratic leader, we up with him.
05:27.160 - 05:30.020:  Well, in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde,
05:30.800 - 05:36.220:  General and Gamer has been outlining why his team of officers toppled the country's long-standing
05:36.220 - 05:40.900:  president and what comes next. I asked our correspondent, Mione Jones, who's following the
05:40.960 - 05:45.860:  story to tell us more about what he's been saying. He's been outlining the reasons for
05:46.120 - 05:50.760:  taking over the country mainly that they did it because they felt that Saturday's elections
05:50.760 - 05:55.660:  were unconstitutional, that they weren't aware of the people, and that it was time for the country
05:55.660 - 06:02.020:  to have new leadership. Gabon's been under the control of the same family for over 50 years now,
06:02.020 - 06:07.740:  and for a lot of Gabonese people. It's meant that the country's huge oil wealth, the resources
06:07.740 - 06:13.280:  that comes from its substantial forest, about 90% of its territory is covered by forestry.
06:13.280 - 06:18.140:  That hasn't trickled down to them, and that's led to a lot of unhappiness, and I think that that's why
06:18.680 - 06:24.120:  when the coup was announced yesterday, we saw the scenes that were released on social media of
06:24.120 - 06:28.720:  kind of huge crowds coming out into the streets of the Capitol Libraville and celebrating.
06:28.720 - 06:35.480:  But I think, as usual, with these coups, it's important to remember that they're not necessarily,
06:35.480 - 06:41.300:  as much as they might immediately have popular support, they're not necessarily a reflection of
06:41.300 - 06:47.180:  kind of popular uprising. This was a military takeover by a small group of armed officers,
06:47.180 - 06:51.200:  you know, that were part of the Republican Guard, there's elite units that was meant to be
06:51.500 - 06:56.040:  protecting the president. They've decided to take over, and as much as they may be saying that
06:56.320 - 07:00.260:  they're here to kind of implement the will of the people, nothing's guaranteed in the future,
07:00.260 - 07:03.880:  whether they will hand over to a civilian government, it's not known yet.
07:04.320 - 07:07.880:  Manny, there has been growing international condemnation of Wednesday's coup,
07:08.280 - 07:12.640:  but what's the latest on the ground in Gabon? Is there any likely heard that this will be overturned?
07:13.360 - 07:17.840:  I think people are kind of waiting now to see what this transitional government is going to do next,
07:17.840 - 07:22.980:  whether they'll appoint some sort of civilian figurehead, as we've seen in Niger and other countries,
07:22.980 - 07:28.240:  or whether Mr. In-Game has going to be in charge of things temporarily. How long will the transition
07:28.240 - 07:33.200:  period last, you know, in Niger? The junta there says it wants to be in place for three years.
07:33.200 - 07:37.700:  The Algerian government has been trying to broker negotiations since it should be six months,
07:38.200 - 07:42.280:  so the length of the transition period and what role is there in game-up plays in the
07:42.280 - 07:46.640:  government? I think we'll be instrumentally knowing what direction this junta wants to go in.
07:47.080 - 07:52.840:  Manny Jones, hours after Hurricane Idaalia slammed into the west coast of Florida,
07:52.840 - 07:57.660:  authorities were still trying to assess the full extent of damage in the hardest-hit areas.
07:58.200 - 08:03.420:  The category three hurricane with winds of up to 125 miles an hour, that's over 200 kilometers
08:03.420 - 08:09.840:  an hour, raised through low-lying towns of Florida's Big Bend area before making its way inland,
08:09.840 - 08:15.440:  and onto the state of Georgia, on North America correspondent John Sudworth reports from Florida.
08:19.440 - 08:23.340:  Brent Berset and David Hickman are mopping out their home.
08:25.200 - 08:28.160:  What a mark right there. But this is the first time you've had a flood like this?
08:28.580 - 08:30.060:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
08:30.780 - 08:37.400:  Idaalia has turned the deep pile carpet in their front room into something resembling a swampy
08:37.440 - 08:45.020:  marsh. We went out on one of the boats because there was, I don't know, maybe six to eight inches
08:45.020 - 08:50.180:  of water in the house. They were right in the way when, as predicted, the hurricane brought with it
08:50.180 - 08:56.680:  a storm surge, pushing the waters from the Gulf of Mexico onto low-lying communities like theirs.
08:57.100 - 09:00.840:  There is this talk about this increased risk of these sorts of adverse weather events.
09:01.980 - 09:07.000:  Does it make you think twice about living so close to the coast? Yeah, that's pretty much so.
09:07.000 - 09:13.220:  Yeah. Yeah, because what used to be late September Hurricane is now
09:14.240 - 09:18.240:  late August hurricane, and they just seem to be getting worse.
09:19.060 - 09:21.380:  Summer is getting hotter, yeah. Sound good.
09:21.900 - 09:25.760:  While many people did heed the warnings to get out of the way of the storm,
09:26.480 - 09:33.100:  many chose to stay to the frustration of firefighters like Chief Tony Perez from Florida's Pasco County.
09:33.580 - 09:39.060:  We do heed the warnings. We do tell people it's a mandatory evacuation, but at the end of the day
09:39.060 - 09:43.920:  they're going to choose hopefully to leave, but unfortunately people have their lifelong belongings
09:43.920 - 09:48.140:  in there. You know, they don't want to lose anything so they rather weather through that storm.
09:48.140 - 09:53.320:  So hopefully this is another indication moving forward that people, when we say mandatory
09:53.320 - 10:01.380:  evacuation, please evacuate. But it is the reality. Many will put themselves in harm's way to protect
10:01.380 - 10:07.820:  their property, especially those whose homes are uninsured. The vulnerability of this coastline,
10:07.820 - 10:13.220:  some of those I've spoken to here tell me, simply makes cover too expensive.
10:14.240 - 10:19.460:  And in the wake of this hurricane, there will once again be questions about the wisdom of continuing
10:19.460 - 10:25.580:  to develop towns and communities in places like this, as well as the cost of protecting them.
10:26.240 - 10:30.760:  President Joe Biden, while promising to provide all the support Florida needs,
10:31.360 - 10:34.300:  spoke of the growing frequency of adverse weather events.
10:35.140 - 10:40.280:  I don't think anybody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore. Just look around.
10:41.020 - 10:47.240:  Historic floods, the main historic floods, more intense droughts, extreme heat,
10:47.480 - 10:52.020:  significant wildfires, of course significant damage like we've never seen before.
10:52.300 - 10:58.000:  Warmer sea temperatures are giving these storms more power, and weakening winds in the earth's
10:58.000 - 11:02.600:  high atmosphere cause them to travel more slowly, making the damage more prolonged.
11:03.560 - 11:09.460:  Even while some residents here are still recovering from last year's hurricane Ian, many are left
11:09.460 - 11:15.320:  wondering what the next one will have in store. John Sardworth, the world's second largest
11:15.320 - 11:21.020:  economy, China, continues to show signs of decline with the property, manufacturing, retail,
11:21.020 - 11:26.040:  and service sectors all struggling. The latest manufacturing figures showed a fifth
11:26.040 - 11:30.300:  straight month of decline. Our Asia Business Correspondent, Nick Marsh reports.
11:31.040 - 11:35.900:  Another month, another set of worrying figures in China. This time round, the numbers were
11:35.900 - 11:41.100:  fractionally better than expected, but ultimately they still show that demand for Chinese goods from
11:41.100 - 11:46.640:  abroad is poor. And for an economy that relies on exports, that's not good news. But there are
11:46.640 - 11:51.580:  deeper problems still. Since lifting tough zero COVID restrictions at the end of last year,
11:52.020 - 11:58.280:  China's seen record low economic growth, record youth unemployment, and falling prices.
11:58.960 - 12:04.560:  Worse still, the country's housing market, which used to be worth a third of China's entire wealth,
12:04.960 - 12:10.260:  has collapsed. It's made households poorer, and the post-pandemic spending boom, seen in most
12:10.260 - 12:17.980:  of the rest of the world, hasn't materialized. Nick Marsh. Abba's singer, Anita Fultzgurk,
12:18.060 - 12:24.720:  has released her first new record in ten years in the form of a solo song, called Where Do We Go
12:24.720 - 12:29.460:  From Here? Well, the track was premiered by our colleagues on BBC Domestic Radio this morning,
12:29.980 - 12:35.540:  and is the first released from Agnette's fourth-coming album, A Plus. Music correspondent Mark Savage
12:39.740 - 12:44.860:  reports. As the lead vocalist on hits such as Vu Le Vu, Chica Tita, and the winner takes it all,
12:45.160 - 12:50.920:  Agnette Fultzgurk is one of the most recognizable voices in pop. But when she was offered a new song
12:50.920 - 12:57.180:  last year, the 73-year-old worried about her ability to perform. It was a girl singing it to the
12:57.180 - 13:02.480:  demon, and I thought I would never do it. We didn't know about the voice, if it was there.
13:02.780 - 13:09.800:  It's the same with the talk in English, because I talk Swedish all the time at home, so I feel a
13:09.800 - 13:15.060:  little rusty right now. She was persuaded to give the song a go by the producer Yorgan Ellison,
13:15.060 - 13:21.300:  who previously put together her 2013 album, A, and despite her concerns, that clear,
13:21.300 - 13:24.400:  yearning soprano is instantly recognizable.
13:33.180 - 13:36.500:  Where do we go from here premiered on BBC Radio to this morning,
13:36.500 - 13:43.000:  and Agnette said the thrill of releasing new music hadn't faded 55 years after her debut single.
13:43.260 - 13:49.940:  You never get tired of it to hear yourself on radio. That's really something. It's always
13:50.380 - 13:56.720:  a tense feeling, you can say, about what are the people going to think about this,
13:57.080 - 14:04.600:  because I'm not so young anymore, and I'm very grateful that I still have my voice.
14:04.920 - 14:09.140:  The song is out today with the album A Plus coming in October.
14:12.560 - 14:13.160:  Mark Savage
14:13.580 - 14:21.740:  Still to come on the podcast? War mobilizes us and unites us. We are ready for victory.
14:21.740 - 14:27.180:  I feel worried about future. I hope that the war will be stopped.
14:27.680 - 14:33.060:  As the drone attacks continue on Moscow and other parts of Russia, we assess the public mood.
14:37.140 - 14:43.280:  The week after next marks 50 years since General Augusto Pinochet seized power in Chile.
14:43.280 - 14:48.740:  The beginning of a brutal dictatorship which saw thousands of his supposed enemies executed,
14:48.740 - 14:54.640:  tortured or simply disappeared. On Wednesday, the Chilean authorities announced a special
14:54.640 - 14:58.740:  commission to try to find the more than a thousand people who are still missing,
14:59.440 - 15:04.920:  announcing the project called Truth and Justice. President Gabriel Borich said Chile had a
15:04.920 - 15:11.940:  historic responsibility to find answers. With this policy, we're taking responsibility,
15:12.140 - 15:19.220:  both as a government and as a country, to do everything we can to find the disappeared.
15:20.140 - 15:26.180:  That will hopefully contradict those who say it's simply too difficult to find out exactly
15:26.300 - 15:31.080:  what did happen to all those who were forcibly disappeared.
15:32.620 - 15:36.720:  For more details about those missing people, my colleague Oliver Conway spoke to
15:36.940 - 15:42.140:  Paola Molina, a freelance radio host based in the Chilean capital Santiago.
15:42.980 - 15:49.780:  Under the military regime in Chile, which last since 1973, there were more than
15:50.180 - 15:58.080:  1,000 people who disappeared and their relatives never find their remains. It's been 50 years
15:58.080 - 16:05.180:  since then and it's been a very painful reality for so many Chilean families. They've been waiting
16:05.180 - 16:11.460:  for all these five decades. They've been doing all their efforts to find their relatives,
16:11.460 - 16:20.300:  to find some remains, but they've been most on their own, basically. Chilean justice has not
16:20.300 - 16:28.300:  been able to deal with all these cases. There is a pact of silence which doesn't allow people to
16:28.300 - 16:34.940:  get information about what happened to their loved ones. 96% of those disappeared were men.
16:35.340 - 16:41.240:  Half of them were people from the countryside. Half of them didn't have any. They were not
16:41.240 - 16:47.800:  affiliated to any political parties and most of the people who have been trying to find them
16:48.040 - 16:55.980:  for so long, they are women. They are the relatives and some of them, after 50 years, just
16:57.060 - 17:01.940:  in some cases, die waiting for a last goodbye to their loved ones.
17:02.420 - 17:08.700:  And what difference will this new commission make in the search for those who are still missing?
17:09.440 - 17:15.240:  The most important part of this project is this led by the state, by the Chilean state.
17:15.240 - 17:21.760:  It will transcend the different governments. It will make a coordinated effort to search for the
17:21.760 - 17:31.440:  missing ones. It will allow financial resources to try to find some remains, but it represents a
17:31.440 - 17:37.920:  chance to say to these families who haven't found the remains of their loved ones, that Chile
17:37.920 - 17:45.060:  in a way takes responsibility for them, that this is not a private drama, that this was part of a
17:45.060 - 17:53.020:  national priority, and that the whole state will collaborate with their efforts. In a way, I feel,
17:53.020 - 18:01.280:  I think, this state-led effort tells all these relatives that they are not alone, that they will
18:01.280 - 18:06.780:  have the support of the rest of the country. I think that's very important in symbolic terms,
18:06.780 - 18:15.700:  and also in practical terms. It gives them a chance to find the remains of those who disappeared.
18:16.300 - 18:17.040:  Paolo Molina.
18:18.300 - 18:23.080:  To Indonesia now, where authorities are looking to get to the bottom of an online love scam,
18:23.100 - 18:28.680:  dozens of Chinese nationals have been arrested, suspected of blackmailing their fellow countrymen,
18:28.960 - 18:34.020:  and trying to extract their cash. They were operating from Batam Island near Singapore,
18:34.020 - 18:40.640:  and they could soon be kicked out of Indonesia and sent back to China. I spoke to BBC Indonesia's
18:40.640 - 18:45.540:  Trisha Dantiani in Jakarta, and asked her to explain how the scam worked.
18:45.540 - 18:52.760:  These Chinese people, they're all in this apartment complex in Batam, and they have Chinese women
18:52.760 - 18:59.580:  with them, who they use to basically exploit collars on video call, basically,
18:59.580 - 19:06.080:  pretend to be interested in them, and get them to go into a video call where the victims
19:06.080 - 19:12.360:  perform sexual acts on the video call, and this video call would be recorded. That video would
19:12.360 - 19:18.040:  then be used as blackmail material to extort money from them, because if they don't send them
19:18.240 - 19:23.740:  money, they would distribute the video on social media, basically, and that's how they keep getting
19:23.740 - 19:29.360:  this revenue stream from these victims who don't want that video to go out.
19:29.880 - 19:31.760:  And how did the police uncover this syndicate?
19:32.640 - 19:39.740:  They received a tip from the Ministry of Public Security in China, who have been getting reports
19:39.740 - 19:45.820:  and indications that there's this love scam going on in China, that a lot of people in China have
19:45.980 - 19:51.740:  been getting their money sort of blackmailed by these mysterious scammers who they don't know where
19:51.740 - 19:56.900:  they are, but there's an indication that they are located somewhere in Indonesia, so they
19:56.900 - 20:02.880:  contacted the Indonesian police force, who basically tracked them down to this specific location
20:02.880 - 20:11.980:  in Batam, the real islands province, and they located this syndicate inside this industrial park
20:11.980 - 20:15.560:  complex, and that's where they've been operating the scheme.
20:16.220 - 20:20.240:  And some of the people who are allegedly blackmailed include some quite high profile people
20:20.240 - 20:27.320:  back in China? Yes, yes, according to the police, there are even public officials and business
20:27.320 - 20:33.900:  people and so on, so forth, that's how they could get as much as 10,000 yuan through this scheme.
20:34.600 - 20:40.260:  And what do we anticipate happens now? Will these Chinese nationals be extradited back to China?
20:41.040 - 20:47.080:  Yes, because they found no indication that there are any Indonesian people who are scammed,
20:47.520 - 20:54.020:  they've reached an agreement with the Chinese police to deport them back to China in
20:54.440 - 20:58.420:  based in parts and portions, so that's going to be the next step.
20:58.720 - 21:04.600:  Trisha Dantiani in Jakarta, to Kenya now, where healthcare professionals are concerned that the
21:04.600 - 21:12.100:  country faces a real shortage of free condoms. Despite a demand for at least 400 million condoms
21:12.100 - 21:18.060:  annually, the government is only able to distribute some 150 million, leaving a significant
21:18.060 - 21:24.220:  shortfall. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a global nonprofit organization, has warned that if the
21:24.220 - 21:30.180:  shortage is not addressed, Kenya could face a preventable spread of sexually transmitted diseases,
21:30.180 - 21:37.220:  including HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. My colleague, James Coppner, spoke to the BBC's
21:37.220 - 21:43.420:  Dorcas Wangira, and asked her why there's a shortage. There are two main reasons. One is the
21:43.420 - 21:48.540:  shrinking donor funding. You have donors like the Global Fund, USAID through PEPFA,
21:49.040 - 21:53.640:  having cutbacks for Kenya and not just Kenya and other African countries. And then the other
21:53.640 - 21:59.700:  issues because of tax, well, condoms are considered medical devices, not medical supplies,
22:00.200 - 22:05.720:  so that means it's at 16% added tax, and that makes it more expensive to import.
22:06.760 - 22:10.840:  When I said earlier, there's concern about healthcare professionals, how widespread is it? What are
22:10.840 - 22:17.340:  people suggesting? Well, you know, the interesting thing is before, in previous years, particularly
22:17.340 - 22:22.800:  before the pandemic, you could walk into a public space like a health facility, a hotel, a restaurant,
22:22.800 - 22:28.960:  and you'd find dispensers with condoms. Now, if you, the scenario is not the same, and the
22:28.960 - 22:33.960:  concern is for the vulnerable populations, people who cannot afford the condoms being sold in
22:33.960 - 22:38.680:  shops, and the concern is that this could threaten the gains made in the fight against HIV,
22:38.680 - 22:44.080:  and other sexually transmitted infections, and also for people who use condoms as a family planning
22:44.080 - 22:48.980:  method. And when we talk, for example, about the fight against HIV, the gains have been quite
22:48.980 - 22:55.540:  significant in Kenya over recent years. Yes, yes, they have, and yesterday they're in a meeting
22:55.540 - 23:00.880:  being held in Mumbai, so the coastal city Kenya has had a significant reduction in HIV cases.
23:01.340 - 23:07.580:  In Africa, we still rank seventh with 1.4 million people living with HIV, and this is partly because
23:07.580 - 23:13.520:  of the supply of free condoms and other interventions, so the gains could be threatened because of this.
23:14.420 - 23:20.320:  And when you said vulnerable people would struggle to afford condoms, or do struggle to afford
23:20.820 - 23:25.920:  the ones you have to pay for, are we talking about quite a large percentage of the population?
23:25.920 - 23:31.840:  I mean, how expensive are condoms in Kenya? Well, so I wouldn't name particular brands, but you'd
23:31.840 - 23:37.300:  find, let's say the cheapest in stores would go for a pack for a dollar, that's a pack of three
23:37.300 - 23:42.720:  condoms, and then you have others that are as expensive as four dollars, and now with the increase
23:42.720 - 23:49.340:  in tax, you're seeing these prices going up. Well, I cannot really say a particular estimate of
23:49.340 - 23:54.920:  the population, but when you think of the rural, the rural poor and the urban poor, that's where the
23:54.920 - 24:00.680:  problem is, and I guess right now that's why this concern has been there, not just now even in
24:00.680 - 24:06.720:  previous years, but it has become worse after the pandemic. So obviously the things you've talked
24:06.720 - 24:11.180:  about are very potentially very serious for Kenya in terms of healthcare, and that obviously
24:11.180 - 24:17.960:  places a burden to on the state's resources, and most of all on Kenya's people. Then I suppose
24:17.960 - 24:22.880:  it becomes a question of priorities. Why does so much of it have to come from foreign donors?
24:23.080 - 24:26.820:  Why is there something that the Kenyan government, for example, is not prioritizing?
24:28.100 - 24:33.480:  And that's a very important question, because the debate right now has been on own resource
24:33.480 - 24:38.940:  mobilization. For a very long time, and not just Kenya, many countries in sub-Saharan Africa,
24:38.940 - 24:45.300:  you have HIV was not just like a country's problem, it was a global problem, and it's only,
24:45.520 - 24:50.140:  particularly after the pandemic, which was a tipping point, for governments to realize that they
24:50.140 - 24:56.340:  have their own priorities, and also I guess even with different political dispensations coming in
24:56.840 - 25:00.920:  from the different donor countries, you're seeing this change, and you're seeing this shift,
25:00.920 - 25:06.160:  but it is definitely something that ministries and Kenya in Kenya, the government has to prioritize.
25:06.160 - 25:14.220:  Dawker's Wangira. It's a year and a half since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion
25:14.220 - 25:20.840:  of Ukraine. Since then, there have been big changes inside Russia. New Western sanctions have
25:20.840 - 25:26.100:  been applied, prominent opposition activists have been arrested, and independent media silenced.
25:26.840 - 25:31.300:  It's getting increasingly difficult now to find out what ordinary Russians think, and what's
25:31.300 - 25:37.160:  really going on inside the country. The BBC's Will Vernon has been traveling around Moscow,
25:37.160 - 25:49.580:  gauging the mood amongst people there. I'm at the Victory Museum in Moscow, it's a sprawling
25:49.580 - 25:57.100:  complex of monuments and exhibitions, and in front of me the square is covered in an enormous
25:57.100 - 26:03.160:  Russian flag, apparently the largest in the country, held high by lines of Russian soldiers.
26:06.260 - 26:11.580:  This is the kind of patriotic event the Kremlin is actively encouraging here.
26:12.160 - 26:17.700:  The message, the country is united behind the President and his special military operation,
26:18.300 - 26:22.300:  even as Ukrainian forces make progress in their counteroffensive.
26:23.980 - 26:29.900:  Actually, this patriotism, you can only rely on yourself, on your country, on your government,
26:29.900 - 26:35.800:  on your army. Andrei Afanasiev is a pro-Kremlin blogger and university lecturer.
26:36.760 - 26:43.580:  War mobilizes us, mobilizes us and unites us, and I'm pretty sure that our strategy now is just
26:44.620 - 26:51.680:  way to kill Ukrainian army and Ukrainian society is totally exhausted. We are ready for that, we are
26:51.900 - 26:58.420:  ready for victory. But victory, whatever form that takes, seems a long way off for Russia.
26:59.160 - 27:06.420:  This conflict was meant to last a few days or weeks, but a year and a half on, and after tens of
27:06.420 - 27:13.580:  thousands of casualties, Russia is losing territory, and drone attacks on Moscow, and now an almost
27:13.580 - 27:20.460:  daily occurrence. I'm driving through Moscow and I'm on the large six-lane highway that circles the
27:20.460 - 27:30.200:  city centre. But if I just put on my satnav, it goes completely haywire, the little dots that
27:30.200 - 27:36.900:  is meant to show my location is jumping all over the place, and it's telling me I'm in a completely
27:36.900 - 27:44.120:  different part of the city. Why is this happening? It's most likely the authorities are trying to
27:44.120 - 27:50.320:  scramble the signal of drones attacking Moscow, causing a lot of inconvenience to ordinary Russians.
27:52.880 - 27:57.260:  I've got to my destination now, I'm in Gorky Park, which is a bit like Moscow's version of
27:57.260 - 28:02.580:  London's Hyde Park, and there are people strolling along the embankment. But if I look just across
28:02.580 - 28:08.380:  from the park, I can see the imposing grey edifice of the Russian Ministry of Defence building,
28:08.380 - 28:14.740:  and just on top of it is a Russian air defence system. With its tubes pointed at the sky,
28:15.260 - 28:21.180:  some sort of radar at the top of it slowly rotating, scanning the skies of Moscow for any potential
28:21.180 - 28:26.620:  threats. Now this is to protect the defence ministry against drones and anything else
28:27.180 - 28:30.800:  unexpected. So I want to see what people think about that, and about the situation in general.
28:33.880 - 28:38.040:  The air defence system doesn't bother me. Let them put a nuclear missile there if they'll feel
28:38.040 - 28:42.660:  better about it. I approve of what is happening. We need to annex all of Ukraine.
28:44.700 - 28:52.620:  I feel safe, but sometimes of course I feel worried about future and about our town.
28:53.600 - 29:01.320:  I hope that our country will war freedom, and the war will be stopped.
29:02.180 - 29:08.260:  Many Russians don't want to talk about what their country is doing in towns and cities in nearby
29:08.260 - 29:14.540:  Ukraine. But traveling around Moscow and talking to people, you don't get the impression that
29:14.540 - 29:21.000:  this country has been infected with war fever. Very few people are wearing t-shirts or clothing
29:21.560 - 29:28.560:  with pro-war symbols on them. But what there is is a lot of indifference, resignation, or even
29:28.560 - 29:37.200:  quiet acceptance. Will Vernon. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new
