00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.460:  by advertising. You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.980 - 00:24.200:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We're recording this at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 22nd of August.
00:24.220 - 00:29.400:  The Pakistani military tries to rescue eight people trapped in a broken cable car dangling
00:29.400 - 00:35.340:  above a ravine. 18 suspected migrants have been found dead in Greece after a forest fire near
00:35.340 - 00:41.420:  the Turkish border. And Thailand's most controversial politician returns from exile but has he done a
00:41.420 - 00:49.200:  deal with his former enemies to avoid a long jail term. Also in the podcast, running around to get
00:49.200 - 00:54.800:  replacement toothpaste, toiletries, a lot of stress I didn't particularly want on my first
00:54.800 - 01:00.140:  folder that I've hung right for years. Last year saw a record amount of lost luggage at airports
01:00.140 - 01:10.480:  but could AI offer a solution. Rescuers from the Pakistani army are trying to free six children
01:10.480 - 01:15.580:  and two adults trapped in a cable car in a remote mountainous area of northwest Pakistan.
01:15.740 - 01:22.420:  It's believed the car is suspended by a single rope after a cable snapped. The mission involving
01:22.420 - 01:27.340:  several military helicopters is being hindered by its strong winds. This man is on the scene.
01:30.080 - 01:35.040:  This is a very sad incident, very unfortunate. It happened at seven in the morning when kids were
01:35.040 - 01:40.480:  going to their schools. A string supporting this lift broke. We're trying our best and so far
01:40.480 - 01:46.220:  four helicopters made attempts to rescue. Now special unit is coming. The local rescue team
01:46.260 - 01:50.620:  are already on standby. We are trying but really don't want to take any chances here.
01:51.600 - 01:55.820:  Well, Harry Bly has been following the story for us and gave me this update just before we
01:55.820 - 02:00.560:  recorded this podcast. Oliver, what we know so far, this is taking place in the Batagram area
02:00.560 - 02:07.340:  in the province of Kaaba, Pak Tuqwa in northern Pakistan. One of the cable car's ropes snapped at seven
02:07.340 - 02:14.700:  o'clock in the morning, local time. That's two GMT. It's unknown how or why it snapped. Inside,
02:14.700 - 02:20.340:  as you mentioned, eight people, six of them are school children. This is because more than 100
02:20.340 - 02:25.460:  school children get to school in the morning. If they were to take the roads, it would take two hours.
02:25.460 - 02:31.480:  This takes four minutes. Photographs show this cable car hanging by one of its two cables,
02:31.480 - 02:37.140:  which means it's leaning at about a 45 degree angle and one of the doors is seen open. It's
02:37.140 - 02:43.880:  worth mentioning. It's not a totally enclosed cable car. It has semi-open sides. One of our
02:43.880 - 02:48.660:  colleagues at BBC Urdu has said that these are often built by local communities and sometimes I
02:48.660 - 02:54.300:  built illegally because there is no other infrastructure and it's a lot cheaper. Police officer has
02:54.300 - 03:00.320:  told the BBC that this one in particular was made by a local mechanic, cable car to very common
03:00.320 - 03:06.100:  because it's very mountainous this region. One of the adults in the cable car has spoken by phone
03:06.100 - 03:12.200:  to the Pakistani news outlet, Geo News, and he has told Geo News that a 16-year-old with a heart
03:12.200 - 03:18.160:  condition has collapsed in the cable car and was unconscious. I'm the footage from the scene
03:18.160 - 03:24.380:  quite incredible, huge drop, but beneath that cable car, tell us more about the rescue operation.
03:25.180 - 03:30.560:  It's very, very risky rescue operation. Military helicopters have reached a location where
03:30.560 - 03:35.840:  the cable car is stuck and they are approaching with caution. There was actually some dramatic footage
03:36.200 - 03:42.200:  circulating online showing a rescuer dangling out of a helicopter attempting to reach the
03:42.200 - 03:47.880:  cable car. Of course the helicopter can't get too close because the helicopter's rotor blades
03:47.880 - 03:55.280:  which produce very strong winds which could destabilise the lift even more. Now in the last 15
03:55.280 - 04:00.860:  minutes officials have told the BBC that they are thinking of laying new cables in attempt to
04:00.860 - 04:07.160:  restabilise the car. It's a high-pressure situation for all the rescuers. There are 500, at least
04:07.160 - 04:13.420:  500 spectators, including the parents of the children who are trapped. It's also past six o'clock
04:13.420 - 04:18.320:  in the evening in that region of Pakistan right now, meaning, of course, the sun will be going down
04:18.320 - 04:25.160:  soon. Harry Bligh there. There have been plenty of tragic stories about wildfires this summer,
04:25.320 - 04:31.360:  but now 18 suspected migrants are thought to have died in a forest fire in Greece. Their bodies
04:31.360 - 04:35.920:  were found in a wooded area where their thoughts were being camping out. Temperatures in Greece
04:35.920 - 04:41.060:  are expected to approach 40 degrees Celsius today. I heard more of my Europe regional editor,
04:41.060 - 04:46.600:  Danny Eberhardt. This particular incident only concerns a group of bodies found in the north
04:46.600 - 04:52.800:  east of Greece near the Turkish border and the Greek fire service has said that the bodies of 18
04:52.800 - 04:57.600:  people were found near a fire and that given that there would be no reports of disappearances
04:57.600 - 05:03.160:  or missing residents from the surrounding area, the possibility is that these people are migrants
05:03.500 - 05:09.840:  legally entered Greece. The route across the Everest River from Turkey is a common route for
05:09.840 - 05:15.340:  migrants, so it looks like a very serious tragedy that's happened there. There have been
05:15.760 - 05:20.400:  a couple of other people who've died in fires in the area, which is around the port of
05:20.400 - 05:25.820:  Alexandra Poulos and also in another area of central Greece in the last couple of days,
05:25.820 - 05:29.860:  but this is clearly the most serious incident to date. Yeah, this news only just coming out,
05:29.860 - 05:34.700:  so not a lot of details, but from what you're saying, it sounds like they might have come into Greece
05:34.700 - 05:39.420:  and then perhaps been hiding out or trying to find somewhere to stay and then got caught up in
05:39.420 - 05:45.160:  this fire. Well, a lot of migrants who cross the border camp basically in sort of wilder areas,
05:45.400 - 05:50.300:  or perhaps on the outskirts of villages or in the forest, that whole area there is actually a
05:50.300 - 05:55.200:  national part with a very forested area. So they're trying to evade the authorities because
05:55.200 - 06:01.140:  their fear being kicked out of Greece if they're found. So it's a very difficult situation for
06:01.140 - 06:08.820:  migrants there. But beyond that, there's the fear that these fires are spreading rapidly. There's
06:08.820 - 06:15.140:  scale-force winds in large areas of Greece, very high temperatures, as you mentioned, and there are
06:15.140 - 06:20.980:  number of fires that have broken out simultaneously in different areas. So we have this area in the
06:20.980 - 06:27.280:  northeast, other areas in the northern region. Parts of central Greece, the Peloponnese,
06:27.520 - 06:33.380:  is also an extreme risk of fire. And the fire services are so stretched, they've reached out to
06:33.380 - 06:39.500:  other European Union countries. So we've had water bombing aircraft sent from Cyprus, we've also
06:39.500 - 06:45.600:  had teams of firefighters from Romania and France. And I expect that the EU will be sending more
06:45.600 - 06:50.500:  help via civil protection mechanism. Oh, you're a regional editor, Danny Eberhard.
06:51.540 - 06:57.620:  Even though he's been in self-imposed exile for 15 years, tax in Chinawatt has dominated politics
06:57.620 - 07:03.680:  in Thailand for two decades. A former policeman, billionaire businessman, and one time owner of
07:03.680 - 07:09.040:  Manchester City Football Club, he served as Thai Prime Minister for five years, until he was
07:09.040 - 07:15.320:  ousted in a coup backed by the Royalist establishment. Today, he has returned to Thailand as part of
07:15.320 - 07:24.940:  what appears to be a deal with his former enemies. Tax in was greeted by hundreds of his famous
07:24.940 - 07:31.080:  red shirt supporters, as he arrived at Bangkok Airport. He was then taken to the Supreme Court,
07:31.080 - 07:36.340:  where he was ordered to serve eight years in prison on long-standing charges. However,
07:36.340 - 07:41.840:  he isn't expected to stay behind bars for long, because just hours after he returned home,
07:41.840 - 07:56.100:  his burr Thai party won a vote to lead a new government. The new coalition includes not
07:56.100 - 08:02.120:  only Mr. Taxin's populists, but also some of the forces which helped overthrow both him and later
08:02.120 - 08:08.960:  his sister. However, it excludes the reformist move forward party, which won the most seats in
08:08.960 - 08:15.460:  the May election, which was in effect blocked from taking up power. So how significant a moment is
08:15.460 - 08:21.880:  this for Thailand? Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head is there. You have to bear in mind how
08:21.880 - 08:27.880:  much this figure of Taxin has overshadowed Thai politics for 20 years. I mean, he absolutely
08:27.880 - 08:33.820:  dominated Thai politics at the beginning of the century when his time in government, but he's
08:33.820 - 08:39.120:  continued to be this enormous influence. And really up until the election this year, his parties,
08:39.120 - 08:44.040:  and they've therefore got dissolved and had to reform themselves, won every single election since
08:44.040 - 08:50.360:  2001. They were unbeatable. Now, things are changing because move forward has become so popular,
08:50.360 - 08:55.740:  because it represents a younger, more progressive force, because so many ties now see the need for
08:55.740 - 09:00.520:  more profound changes. A lot of people who supported Pur Thai shifted over to move forward in the
09:00.520 - 09:05.460:  last election. So in many ways, there's deal that we see going down. We think is going down.
09:05.460 - 09:10.020:  It's not final yet. We don't know how long Mr. Taxin is going to spend in jail. He clearly
09:10.020 - 09:14.180:  thinks he's going to get lenient treatment, but the fact that there is this deal happening with
09:14.180 - 09:19.200:  parties who have absolutely demonized Taxin as an enemy of the royalists, of the monarchy,
09:19.200 - 09:24.800:  of the royalist assertions in the past, tells you that Pur Thai has now seen in a different light.
09:25.120 - 09:29.220:  Yeah, I mean, just take us through what we could expect in the next few weeks and months from
09:29.220 - 09:34.840:  this new Thai government. Well, you know, they've got a portion ministerial post. There's been a
09:34.840 - 09:39.760:  huge amount of horse trading. You had 11 parties in there. Very different complexion. Some of them,
09:40.360 - 09:44.920:  it's going to be very difficult for people who hoped for change in the election in May where,
09:45.480 - 09:50.660:  you know, if you included Pur Thai and that reformist coalition, that was two thirds of all the votes
09:51.120 - 09:55.900:  voting for something new. Now Pur Thai has got into bed with its former adversaries. Everything's
09:55.900 - 10:01.060:  very transactional. It's unlikely they'll be able to push forward any of the reform agendas
10:01.060 - 10:05.860:  like keeping the military out of politics, changing the constitution, things like that. They will now
10:05.860 - 10:11.120:  be a very low priority as more conservative parties fight for projects that help us help their
10:11.120 - 10:16.220:  areas or help them get rich. It's in some ways a rather dismal end to what have been a very hopeful
10:16.220 - 10:21.900:  moment in Thai politics, but I think they will work very hard to get the economy going. It's been
10:21.900 - 10:27.020:  very, very slow moving for many years now. I think they hope that if they can do that, if they can
10:27.020 - 10:31.760:  make the economy go, people will forgive the rather shabby way in which this coalition has come
10:31.760 - 10:37.400:  together. And briefly will young people in Thailand accept this? No, I don't think they will. The
10:37.400 - 10:41.300:  real question is just what they're willing to do about it. We've seen so many protests in the past.
10:41.760 - 10:47.540:  If Thailand's conflict, its evolution has not stopped. It's simply gone into a different chapter
10:47.980 - 10:52.960:  in which Mr. Taxin, who's been such a big figure and his past, you will no longer be so important.
10:52.960 - 11:00.200:  Jonathan heard in the Thai capital Bangkok. Now onto some less dramatic news. Last year was the
11:00.200 - 11:05.900:  worst in a decade for passengers bags going missing on airline flights. Our reporter Jennifer
11:05.900 - 11:13.480:  Mayhans has the details. 26 million pieces of luggage were lost delayed or damaged in 2022. That's
11:13.480 - 11:20.580:  nearly eight bags in every thousand. And that was the highest rate since 2012 when it was 26.3
11:20.580 - 11:27.480:  million and nearly nine pieces were mishandled per thousand passengers. Things are improving though.
11:27.480 - 11:34.140:  I asked CETA, which handles the IT systems for most of the world's airlines for its provisional
11:34.140 - 11:40.760:  data for the first half of this year. Now that came out there were 5.7 million pieces of luggage
11:40.760 - 11:47.980:  that were mishandled, which is down from 5.8 million in the first half of 2019, which is our
11:47.980 - 11:54.920:  last real comparative time before the pandemic when passenger numbers are similar. So really big numbers
11:54.920 - 12:01.340:  last year, but seems to be getting better. Yeah, slight improvement, but why was last year so bad?
12:01.880 - 12:06.040:  Well, this was the first summer that holiday makers returned in their droves after COVID
12:06.040 - 12:10.800:  travel restrictions were eased, but lots of airports and airlines that had made cuts during the
12:10.800 - 12:16.840:  pandemic struggled to recruit staff like baggage handlers quickly enough to cope. A CETA's report
12:16.840 - 12:23.220:  found that the increase in 2022 was down to increases during transfers from flights to flights,
12:23.260 - 12:30.400:  and they accounted for 42% of the baggage mishandling. And of course, these are numbers,
12:30.400 - 12:35.900:  but each bag lost is at a real pain for each passenger. Yes, it can be a really
12:35.900 - 12:41.300:  distressing thing to happen. I went to meet 27-year-old Chloe. She was flying from Gatwick to
12:41.300 - 12:46.660:  Pisa in Italy for her friend's wedding when her luggage got lost. I spent the first couple of
12:46.660 - 12:50.700:  hours, which she would normally think I'll go and see the sights. We're running around shops,
12:50.700 - 12:56.180:  trying to find pharmacies to get like replacement toothpaste, toiletries, a lot of stress
12:56.300 - 13:00.080:  I didn't particularly want on kind of my first holiday that I've had in quite a few years,
13:00.120 - 13:04.040:  and I was the experience of witnessing my friend get married, which unfortunately,
13:04.040 - 13:08.040:  I'll never be able to relive because I've actually had to want some lifetime opportunity.
13:08.660 - 13:13.760:  Of course, on top of all the stress, is she still without her bag? That happened on the first of August,
13:14.460 - 13:19.820:  and it's not so easy as you would think to get compensation. If it happens to you, you need to report
13:19.820 - 13:25.620:  it at the airport and keep a copy of the property irregularity report, and then you can use that
13:25.620 - 13:31.440:  to contact the airline in writing, but it's worth knowing that most airlines, the maximum they'll
13:31.440 - 13:38.080:  pay out is around $1,000, because they just don't take liability for expensive or sentimental items.
13:38.820 - 13:44.320:  You need to provide receipts as proof of purchase, which often we don't have for everything that
13:44.320 - 13:49.980:  we've packed, and airlines also judge the value of an item on its age when it was lost,
13:49.980 - 13:56.180:  not how much it cost to buy new, so it's often better to claim via your travel insurance.
13:56.840 - 14:02.080:  Now, more and more of us are taking our bags in the cabin, but if you put your cases in the hold,
14:02.080 - 14:06.440:  how can you avoid losing them and then getting them back if they do go missing?
14:06.980 - 14:11.360:  Yeah, there are a few things you can do to reduce the risk of your luggage going missing,
14:11.360 - 14:16.340:  so one is to make sure that your name and address are on the inside and outside of your bag,
14:16.760 - 14:22.000:  that way if the tracking tag comes off during the flight, the airline knows where to send it.
14:22.720 - 14:27.280:  It's also a good idea to make your bag stand out so you can add coloured straps or stickers,
14:27.720 - 14:32.260:  and that's more to stop someone mistakenly picking up your bag at the airport instead of theirs.
14:33.160 - 14:37.660:  Keep valuables in your hand luggage just for your own peace of mind, they'll be with you at all times.
14:38.400 - 14:43.580:  Some people use a GPS tag link to a smartphone so you can follow your luggage journey,
14:44.140 - 14:49.900:  but all airlines have to track your luggage at various points during the journey.
14:50.660 - 14:54.520:  If your luggage does go missing, there is technology to help get it back to you,
14:54.780 - 15:00.260:  so some airlines are trialling an algorithm that works out if you're going to get to a destination,
15:00.260 - 15:05.640:  but your luggage isn't, it will find out what the next best available flight is and redirect your
15:05.640 - 15:12.260:  bag onto that flight without any human intervention. The situation is expected to improve further
15:12.380 - 15:18.480:  as 96% of airlines are planning to digitise baggage operations by 2025.
15:19.200 - 15:21.040:  Our reporter Jennifer Mayhands
15:23.360 - 15:27.860:  and still to come on the Global News podcast, Scotland looks to Portugal for inspiration
15:27.860 - 15:29.880:  on how to tackle drug abuse.
15:42.580 - 15:43.180:  Yes, yes.
15:48.960 - 15:53.620:  Defence officials in Ukraine say claims of corruption in its army recruitment service
15:53.620 - 15:58.580:  are shameful and unacceptable, but they still need to mobilise men to fight off Russia's
15:58.580 - 16:02.520:  invaders. President Zelensky recently sacked every regional recruitment
16:02.520 - 16:07.660:  head after widespread allegations, including both intimidation and taking bribes.
16:08.080 - 16:11.040:  Are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse has this report?
16:13.720 - 16:18.580:  Probably not what these men were hoping for, it is gambling archaed in the key of region.
16:20.140 - 16:25.240:  Arrayed by draft officers, ordering them to sign up at the local military recruitment centre,
16:25.920 - 16:30.840:  a common sight in wartime Ukraine, but there are big questions over how it's done.
16:31.460 - 16:36.240:  The system is very outdated, it's like Soviet times,
16:36.660 - 16:39.880:  recruiters using these methods now is unacceptable.
16:40.380 - 16:44.880:  That's Yohor, not his real name, he's not happy with the military's methods.
16:51.740 - 16:56.600:  Military recruitment ads are everywhere on billboards, online, on TV,
16:57.240 - 16:59.380:  but the flow of volunteers has gone down.
17:01.420 - 17:05.700:  Because of Russia's invasion, Ukraine wants to replace the tens of thousands of personnel
17:05.700 - 17:10.100:  killed and injured, as well as rest troops who have been on the front line for months,
17:11.060 - 17:15.780:  but the system is seen as old fashioned and now corrupted its core.
17:17.260 - 17:21.380:  More than 100 criminal cases have been launched, some officials have been arrested
17:21.380 - 17:24.060:  for taking bribes to help men avoid the draft.
17:25.620 - 17:28.980:  There are exemptions, including poor health for being a single parent,
17:29.560 - 17:34.540:  but martial law means there's no option of alternative service for those who just don't want to fight.
17:36.780 - 17:40.580:  Alexander thinks he should be exempt because of being part of the had a Christian movement,
17:41.220 - 17:43.240:  but officials weren't exactly impressed.
17:43.980 - 17:50.340:  If it is necessary, I'm ready to serve. I could help as a cook, give out humanitarian aid,
17:50.340 - 17:54.140:  work as a medical volunteer, but I cannot use weapons.
17:54.920 - 17:57.380:  While some try to appeal, they're right not to fight,
17:57.840 - 18:01.840:  thousands try to avoid the draft, for example, with old fashioned tip-offs.
18:02.840 - 18:05.700:  So we're driving around the outskirts of Kiev,
18:05.700 - 18:09.920:  following the updates on this telegram group with more than 100,000 members.
18:10.460 - 18:16.040:  And just look at this update, it says close to a shopping mall in the posniki area of the capital,
18:16.320 - 18:19.900:  and at the bottom, it has the number two next to an olive emoji,
18:20.100 - 18:26.940:  and olives are the nicknames they use for the drafting officers because of the color of their uniforms.
18:28.220 - 18:31.740:  Mobilization is why most men under 60 can't leave the country.
18:31.980 - 18:35.180:  The authorities often post videos of them trying to flee illegally.
18:39.780 - 18:42.700:  It's okay to be scared as the military's latest slogan.
18:44.500 - 18:47.060:  Unveiled by deputy defense minister Anamalia.
18:49.580 - 18:51.720:  This is the sound of resistance training for civilians,
18:54.760 - 19:00.300:  and they are wearing body armor with laser attachments on the end of weapons.
19:00.300 - 19:00.660:  But there is a background hope here,
19:01.720 - 19:07.100:  and it's important to be aware that there are a lot of people who are in need of help.
19:07.160 - 19:10.800:  This is the sound of resistance training for civilians,
19:11.440 - 19:17.640:  and they are wearing body armor with laser attachments on the end of weapons,
19:18.140 - 19:21.960:  but there is a background hope here that some of the people here,
19:22.500 - 19:25.300:  they might volunteer for the armed forces down the line.
19:27.300 - 19:31.640:  You realise the Ukraine of today is fighting for its tomorrow, for its existence.
19:32.400 - 19:34.380:  Eighteen months into Russia's full-scale invasion,
19:34.820 - 19:39.240:  the country is having to balance its need for soldiers with the idea that the battlefield
19:39.760 - 19:40.540:  isn't for everyone.
19:42.000 - 19:44.340:  Are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse?
19:45.200 - 19:47.880:  A new study suggests that a 10-minute MRI scan
19:47.880 - 19:51.760:  could be a more effective way of screening men for prostate cancer.
19:52.240 - 19:56.440:  The scans proved far more accurate at diagnosing the cancer than blood tests,
19:56.440 - 19:59.320:  which look for high levels of a protein called PSA.
19:59.740 - 20:02.460:  The BBC's medical editor, Fergus Walsh, spoke to Rob Young.
20:03.220 - 20:06.560:  So there were 300 men aged 50 to 75,
20:07.360 - 20:10.260:  who were invited to University College Hospital,
20:10.260 - 20:15.260:  because hospital in Central London for this study led by University College London.
20:15.780 - 20:19.860:  They had a 10-minute MRI scan of their prostate,
20:20.340 - 20:23.060:  and they also had the traditional blood test,
20:23.100 - 20:24.880:  known as the PSA blood test,
20:25.440 - 20:31.020:  and the brief MRI scan proved much better at diagnosing cancer,
20:31.020 - 20:37.020:  and especially the aggressive cancers that need treatment of 25 men,
20:37.020 - 20:39.460:  whose aggressive cancer was found by MRI.
20:40.380 - 20:44.500:  More than half of them had negative PSA tests,
20:44.500 - 20:50.280:  low negative PSA tests, which would have meant they would have been given false reassurance
20:50.280 - 20:55.400:  that they were cancer-free, whereas in fact they had a cancer that needed urgent treatment.
20:55.980 - 21:01.660:  Right, so this is potentially a game-changer then in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
21:02.280 - 21:05.020:  Yes, I think it is. Then the question arises,
21:05.720 - 21:11.380:  what do you do with that information? Because MRI machines are big and expensive,
21:11.920 - 21:18.220:  so the plan, the hope is that eventually it might lead to screening programs,
21:18.220 - 21:24.200:  because MRI is already used in many countries as part of the diagnostic pathway.
21:25.020 - 21:29.540:  When people have a high PSA result, they then may be sent for an MRI,
21:29.540 - 21:33.460:  but what the hope is now that this could actually lead to screening programs,
21:33.460 - 21:36.640:  like you have in many countries for breast cancer,
21:37.100 - 21:41.680:  where women come forward for mammograms, but I think that's quite some way off.
21:42.000 - 21:46.400:  Now the PSA test, the blood test, does have definite value,
21:46.860 - 21:52.900:  and countries like the US, Spain, and Italy, which use the blood tests more frequently
21:52.940 - 21:58.700:  than many others have lower mortality rates, but the problem is it overdiagnoses.
21:59.100 - 22:03.000:  It picks up many cancers that would never leave the prostate,
22:03.000 - 22:06.360:  and don't need treatment, and it misses some cancers too,
22:06.500 - 22:11.600:  and it can lead to over-treatment as well. Does this then make it more likely that people
22:11.600 - 22:19.500:  could be cured of prostate cancer? Yes, in a word yes, because prostate cancer is very
22:19.500 - 22:25.140:  treatable and very curable if it's caught early. Fogus Walsh, our medical editor,
22:25.140 - 22:31.440:  talking to Rob Young. The number of people who died from drugs in Scotland in 2022
22:31.440 - 22:37.340:  fell to the lowest level in five years. However, Scotland still has the worst drug death rate in
22:37.340 - 22:43.500:  Europe, with narcotics mostly opiates like heroin, morphine, and methadone, claiming about 90 lives
22:43.500 - 22:48.380:  a month. Scotland has struggled to get on top of the problem for years, and the government there
22:48.380 - 22:54.100:  has proposed decriminalising personal use, looking to the example of Portugal, which did the same
22:54.100 - 22:59.020:  more than 20 years ago. James Cook has been investigating the Portuguese experience,
22:59.100 - 23:07.960:  and sent this report from the city of Porto. Portugal has come a long way in a short time.
23:10.300 - 23:15.840:  Half a century ago this country was a closed dictatorship. Nowadays it's an open and vibrant
23:15.840 - 23:22.660:  democracy buzzing with tourists, although there is another side. So by no means everywhere,
23:22.660 - 23:28.160:  but in the past few days I've seen more drug use on the streets of Lisbon and Porto than I have
23:28.160 - 23:36.120:  in Glasgow or Edinburgh for years, and yet there are vastly more drug deaths in Scotland. Why?
23:39.500 - 23:45.580:  Chogolau says one answer might be the legal framework. More than 20 years ago he helped to design
23:45.580 - 23:50.060:  Portugal's decriminalisation policy. He's still in charge of it.
23:50.440 - 23:59.220:  Drug use has a massive phenomenon here in Portugal, exploded after our democratic revolution in
23:59.220 - 24:08.260:  74. We were facing very severe epidemic related to Erwin, mostly to Erwin, and accordingly we
24:08.260 - 24:17.320:  proposed the decriminalisation of drug use. The aim can be summed up in two words, harm reduction.
24:18.280 - 24:24.380:  I am Roberta Hays, I'm a psychologist and I work like a technical coordinator of the drug
24:24.380 - 24:30.600:  conception, Romanales. They can take shower, they can do laundry, we can be tested for
24:30.600 - 24:39.740:  a infections disease like hepatitis B and C, HIV, and then they can be linkage to healthcare
24:40.380 - 24:49.320:  service. Taking drugs in Portugal is not criminal, but it's not legal either. There is a distinction,
24:49.320 - 24:55.640:  habitual users can still be referred for treatment and counselling or find, but they won't go to court,
24:56.180 - 25:01.540:  let alone prison. As we find out on the outskirts of Portugal's second city, Porto.
25:02.160 - 25:07.620:  Why are you here today? I came because I came to smoke, I came to consume cocaine.
25:08.700 - 25:14.080:  My real name is Luis Miguel, but everybody calls me binagre. When I started using drugs,
25:14.080 - 25:25.780:  I was 14 years old, and when I was 18, I started to inject, and then I kept the disease HIV.
25:27.220 - 25:35.500:  I have HIV for 26 years. When you are taking drugs, your life is like a prison. You
25:35.500 - 25:44.020:  wake up, sinking in drugs, you lay down sinking in drugs. It's the only sort of sinking in your
25:44.020 - 25:50.440:  mind. It's drugs, drugs, drugs. The police have brought us to a neighborhood called Pashdalera
25:50.840 - 25:56.540:  here in Porto, and within the middle of a housing estate, it's crisscrossed by little alleyways
25:56.540 - 26:02.300:  and small squares as a woman just peering behind the shutters that are seeing what's going on.
26:02.700 - 26:08.340:  What has happened here has been transformational, because a few months ago, the police tell us we
26:08.660 - 26:13.100:  simply couldn't have been here. The area had a huge problem with drug trafficking, the police
26:13.100 - 26:18.640:  moved in, cleared the problem away. Of course, they acknowledge it's moved to other parts of the
26:18.640 - 26:26.180:  city. That really underlines the challenge for the police here in Portugal, where drug consumption
26:26.240 - 26:31.840:  is treated as a public health issue, but drug supply remains in the hands of the criminals.
26:32.420 - 26:36.560:  My name is Rue Moreira, I'm the mayor of the city of Porto since 2013.
26:36.620 - 26:43.180:  When the law changed in 2001, Mr. Moreira was running a nightclub. You had suddenly a population
26:43.180 - 26:50.040:  of people who would go to the door of the school where it's not allowed to smoke, where it's
26:50.040 - 26:57.060:  forbidden to advertise ice cream or sweets, but people can be there and they can be shooting drugs
26:57.180 - 27:04.700:  and nothing happens. So, has this policy failed? Failure is maybe too strong a word, because it would
27:04.700 - 27:11.680:  mean going back and I don't think we should go back to the original plan of prohibition, but I think
27:11.680 - 27:17.720:  it should be criminalized in some places. Shorgolao does not think the policy needs to be changed,
27:17.740 - 27:24.800:  but he has a word of warning for Scotland. The criminalization by itself gives you nothing,
27:24.860 - 27:31.940:  but all the other responses, treatment, having reduction are much more efficient within a
27:31.940 - 27:41.620:  decriminalized environment than they were before. More than 20 years after Portugal decriminalized drug
27:41.620 - 27:47.280:  use, no one says it's a magic bullet. The problem is complex, every country is different,
27:47.340 - 27:54.500:  but the fact remains far, far fewer drug users are dying here than are dying in Scotland.
27:56.120 - 28:01.080:  James Cook in the Portuguese city of Porto. Now, while we've been recording this edition of
28:01.080 - 28:05.980:  the Global News podcast, we've had an update on the first story we covered, the eight people
28:05.980 - 28:12.780:  trapped in a cable car in Pakistan. Well, it's now been confirmed that one of the six children's
28:12.780 - 28:19.220:  stuck there has been rescued and you can get live updates on our website, BBCNews.com.
28:20.260 - 28:26.920:  Finally, a joke about an unfaithful zookeeper has been named as the funniest one-liner of this
28:26.920 - 28:33.680:  year's Edinburgh festival. I started dating a zookeeper, but it turned out he was a cheater.
28:34.180 - 28:40.020:  That gag makes Lorna Rose train the first female comedian to win since Zoe Lyons took the very
28:40.020 - 28:47.260:  first fringe joke award back in 2008. The short list of 10 jokes is drawn up by a panel of comedy
28:47.260 - 28:52.520:  critics and the public vote on their favourite three. So just for you, here are the ones I would have
28:52.520 - 28:59.580:  picked. I entered the How Not to Surrender competition and I won hands down. Well, that was by
28:59.580 - 29:07.260:  the defeatist Bennett Aaron. Amos Gil had a topical one about economics. Last year I had a great joke
29:07.260 - 29:13.700:  about inflation, but it's hardly worth it now. And my own personal favourite from Frank Lavender.
29:14.420 - 29:18.220:  How does Celiac Germans greet each other? Gluten Tag.
29:21.160 - 29:26.060:  And that is all from us for now, but the Global News podcast will be back very soon. If you want
29:26.060 - 29:32.860:  to comment on the podcast or anything in it, send an email to globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk.

29:39.840 - 29:44.380:  The producer of this edition was Harry Blight. It was mixed by Mike Campbell, our editors Karen
29:44.380 - 29:47.160:  Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
