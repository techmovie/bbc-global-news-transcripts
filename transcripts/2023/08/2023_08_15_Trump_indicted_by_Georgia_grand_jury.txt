00:49.180 - 00:54.080:  I was working in a coffee shop in Boston to help pay rent while I was training for the trials.
00:54.080 - 00:57.460:  And so people kept joking and they were like, oh yeah, she just took a two hour coffee break
00:57.620 - 00:59.880:  and went and ran the Olympic trials bare at that.
01:01.000 - 01:06.140:  On the podium is back with more Olympians and Paralympians sharing their journeys to the top.

01:12.920 - 01:16.860:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:16.860 - 01:25.020:  I'm Valerie Sanderson and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 15th of August, these are our main stories.
01:25.020 - 01:31.560:  We're in Washington for reaction after prosecutors in the US state of Georgia charged 19 people,
01:32.000 - 01:36.260:  including former president Donald Trump, in connection with the 2020 election.
01:36.940 - 01:42.620:  British police have arrested and charged three Bulgarian nationals suspected of spying for Russia.
01:43.380 - 01:48.440:  Spain are through to the final of the women's world cup after beating Sweden 21.
01:51.120 - 01:55.380:  Also in this podcast, two years on from the Taliban take over in Afghanistan,
01:56.060 - 01:58.300:  women in the country tell us about their lives.
01:58.760 - 02:00.960:  Right in front of this restaurant there's a building.
02:00.960 - 02:04.880:  It used to be the Ministry of Women's Affairs, but guess what?
02:05.160 - 02:09.160:  The Taliban government has turned it into the Ministry of Vice and Virtuno.
02:09.860 - 02:17.000:  And why the true story that inspired the Oscar-winning film The Blind Side has taken a much darker turn.
02:20.840 - 02:26.280:  We begin with Donald Trump. He's already the first former US president to face criminal charges,
02:26.280 - 02:32.520:  and now he's facing a further tranche of allegations. Donald Trump and 18 of his closest allies
02:32.520 - 02:37.440:  have been indicted on state racketeering and conspiracy charges in the state of Georgia,
02:37.440 - 02:42.480:  over alleged efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election.
02:42.480 - 02:46.160:  The Fulton County District Attorney is funny with us.
02:46.520 - 02:51.640:  A Fulton County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment,
02:51.640 - 03:00.320:  charging 19 individuals with violations of Georgia law arising from a criminal conspiracy
03:00.340 - 03:06.680:  to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in this state.
03:06.680 - 03:11.460:  The Democratic Congressman Adam Smith, one of Mr. Trump's political opponents,
03:11.460 - 03:14.580:  gave the BBC his reaction to the indictment.
03:14.960 - 03:18.600:  By all accounts former President Trump is probably going to get the nomination,
03:18.600 - 03:25.480:  and the degree to which his criminal behavior becomes more and more exposed only seems to fire
03:25.480 - 03:29.620:  up the Republican Party to support him more, which is deeply troubling.
03:29.620 - 03:34.160:  The Republican Party is not in a good place in our country, it's a real problem,
03:34.320 - 03:38.420:  and I hope they figure it out, and I hope they get past the cult of Donald Trump and get back
03:38.420 - 03:42.640:  to being a reasonable conservative party. But right now they are not that.
03:43.420 - 03:49.000:  Jennifer Kerns, a former Republican strategist, expressed her concern for the Republican Party.
03:49.660 - 03:55.020:  They don't understand the impact this is going to have on swing voters and on female suburban voters.
03:55.020 - 03:59.580:  They don't like all of these indictments stacking up. They kind of shy away from this sort of
03:59.580 - 04:06.200:  drama right in the public square. And I just don't think that the Republican side really understands
04:06.200 - 04:12.120:  the impact that this is going to have negatively. I got more details from Werner Davis in Washington.
04:12.620 - 04:17.700:  Donald Trump himself called it a politically motivated witch hunt to stop him being elected
04:17.700 - 04:23.780:  again next year. His view at least publicly is the more of these cases, these charges that
04:23.780 - 04:29.320:  are laid against him the further he rises in the opinion polls. I think obviously his base will
04:29.320 - 04:34.600:  always support him. But these are very, very serious charges. Trump and his co-defendants will
04:34.600 - 04:40.660:  have to present themselves before next Friday in Georgia to be formally charged with these
04:41.080 - 04:46.320:  latest charges. The prosecutor has made it clear that she would like to see a trial within six
04:46.320 - 04:50.800:  months. And of course, the significance of that is that that's right in the middle of next year's
04:50.800 - 04:57.180:  election campaign when Donald Trump wants to be elected again as president. I think it'll be
04:57.180 - 05:02.440:  very difficult for Mr. Trump to bat this one off as easily as he's been able to do with some of
05:02.440 - 05:08.180:  the other charges because these are significantly not federal charges. These are allegations of crimes
05:08.180 - 05:12.900:  committed in the state of Georgia. And if he were to be convicted, it would be much more difficult
05:12.900 - 05:18.060:  for Donald Trump even if he were to be reelected elected again as president to pardon himself
05:18.060 - 05:23.700:  of these charges. So they are very significant charges indeed. Do you have any idea what his
05:23.700 - 05:28.880:  defense is likely to be? Well, it depends which of the counts you're talking about. One of the most
05:28.880 - 05:34.320:  egregious bits of evidence is a phone call that Donald Trump made to an election official in
05:34.320 - 05:41.280:  Georgia asking for just over a thousand votes to be found. Now that may be argued by the prosecution
05:41.280 - 05:47.060:  as evidence that he was looking to either find votes to tamper with votes or Mr. Trump himself.
05:47.060 - 05:52.720:  It was a perfectly innocent phone call stating how many votes he was behind in the polls as the
05:52.720 - 05:58.460:  votes were being counted. There are other charges as well in which allies of Trump or former allies
05:58.460 - 06:03.900:  of Trump, we know of given evidence to the grand jury about things like trying to tamper with the
06:04.220 - 06:08.940:  electoral system in the United States. There's allegations that he and some of his co-defendants,
06:09.240 - 06:15.140:  including his senior lawyer Rudy Giuliani, were also involved in trying to overturn the election
06:15.140 - 06:20.460:  in the state of Georgia. So some of these charges are going to be very difficult for Donald Trump
06:20.460 - 06:25.580:  to defend himself against, although he has said again that this is a politically motivated
06:25.580 - 06:33.000:  exercise and he expects to come out on top. We're a Davis in Washington. Two years ago today,
06:33.000 - 06:38.320:  the Taliban seized power enough Galistan and went on to impose extensive restrictions on women
06:38.320 - 06:42.760:  and girls. Teenagers and young women were banned from attending schools and universities,
06:42.760 - 06:48.800:  and recently hair and beauty salons were shot. The BBC has heard from Afghan women about their
06:48.800 - 06:57.240:  daily experiences since the Taliban took control. We have come to a restaurant, but they say that
06:57.240 - 07:07.160:  they don't allow women inside anymore. It's frustrating. I'm in a taxi right now. I'm heading
07:07.160 - 07:14.540:  to a nearby market in Kabul, but there are many places where a lot of restrictions still exist for women.
07:15.020 - 07:18.160:  If a female walks without a male guardian, they can face problems.
07:20.420 - 07:26.320:  So we've finally made it to a restaurant. Right in front of this restaurant, there's a building.
07:26.340 - 07:32.580:  It used to be the Ministry of Women's Affairs, but guess what? The Taliban government has turned
07:32.580 - 07:40.280:  into the Ministry of Vice and Virtue now. This Vice and Virtue Ministry is all about morality and
07:40.280 - 07:48.880:  how people, especially women, look on the outside. I studied a book about the war between Germany
07:48.880 - 07:56.980:  and Russia at the time of Nazis. The book says how much war has destroyed the morale and mind of
07:57.000 - 08:06.020:  people. When I read it, I cried. The women who are hearing my voice right now, be strong and
08:06.020 - 08:12.560:  hope for a bright future. The Taliban's return has also brought economic and humanitarian crises,
08:13.060 - 08:18.000:  partly due to countries in aid agencies with drawing support because of the treatment of women.
08:18.700 - 08:23.980:  Now, the new United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan has warned that a huge
08:23.980 - 08:29.100:  shortfall in funding could lead to the collapse of the country's health system and to widespread
08:29.100 - 08:34.360:  hunger. Archive international correspondently is to set as cover of Afghanistan for many years,
08:34.360 - 08:38.580:  and she was in the country when the Taliban regained power in 2021.
08:39.240 - 08:44.760:  Of all the issues that symbolize the Taliban's authoritarian rule and the broken promises,
08:44.760 - 08:50.160:  it is these tightening restrictions on the lives of girls and women. It is a conservative country,
08:50.160 - 08:55.640:  but what we've seen over the past two years is almost with every month, any racing of women
08:55.640 - 09:00.580:  and girls from public life, everywhere from girls education, even women banned from public
09:00.580 - 09:05.940:  parks and beauty parlors. The Taliban keeps saying this is not going to be forever. We're just trying
09:05.940 - 09:11.460:  to implement it in a way that respects Sharia law, but that's what they said the first time around.
09:11.460 - 09:17.960:  So, when I spoke to Taliban spokesman Zabil Umurjahad, I said most people believe your restrictive
09:18.100 - 09:25.040:  ethics are here to stay. Women are working in some places now. For example, and help,
09:25.040 - 09:32.620:  education, police, passports, national ID departments, airports. In these places, women have been
09:32.620 - 09:38.880:  working, and for the rest as well, as long as Sharia allows it, and there is a need. The same
09:38.880 - 09:43.900:  goes for girls education. We have never said that these restrictions are going to be forever.
09:44.100 - 09:52.900:  How long will it take? One year, five years? We are hoping it will be solved very soon by
09:52.900 - 10:01.680:  that. Solved very soon. Well, this impasse is devastating for Afghans, devastating economic crisis,
10:02.160 - 10:07.660:  but also donors are turning away. Now, the United Nations appeal for Afghanistan, which used to
10:07.660 - 10:14.520:  be overfunded when the international community was there, is now only a quarter funded. And this
10:14.520 - 10:19.800:  has had a huge impact. Only a third of the Afghans who desperately need food aid are now getting
10:19.800 - 10:25.620:  them up. The UN saying that funding is going to run out for major hospitals. So, when I spoke to
10:25.620 - 10:32.360:  Daniel Andres, who's the new UN humanitarian coordinator, I said, is the world forgetting Afghanistan?
10:33.020 - 10:39.820:  Yeah, to some extent, we have to say that Afghanistan has no longer the primary attention. And also,
10:40.380 - 10:45.160:  you know, one message that Afghan people really give us so forcefully and strongly is, please
10:45.160 - 10:51.860:  don't abandon us. You know, the economic collapse or the economic reduction that happened
10:51.860 - 10:58.460:  when the Taliban took over is severe. Many people lost their jobs. Many people became in need of
10:58.460 - 11:04.440:  humanitarian support. And especially women and girls say, you know, we are already in a very
11:04.440 - 11:10.880:  difficult situation. If you take away our jobs and if you take away even the basic needs that we have,
11:10.880 - 11:16.500:  where should we end up? Daniel Andres, UN humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan,
11:17.220 - 11:20.500:  talking there to our chief international correspondent, Listo said,
11:21.760 - 11:27.220:  Police in Britain have arrested and charged three Bulgarian nationals suspected of spying for
11:27.220 - 11:32.520:  Russia in what's been described as a major national security operation. They're due to be tried
11:32.520 - 11:38.900:  in January. Daniel Dismun reports. The three Bulgarian defendants, two men and a woman,
11:38.900 - 11:45.720:  are charged with possessing fake identity documents with improper intention. They include passports
11:45.720 - 11:53.380:  and identity cards for the UK, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Slovenia, Greece,
11:53.380 - 12:00.880:  and the Czech Republic. All in Rousseff, Beezer, Dejampasov, and Katrin Ivanova were arrested
12:00.880 - 12:05.700:  under the Official Secrets Act in February. It is alleged they were working as intelligence
12:05.700 - 12:13.060:  operatives for the Russian state. Daniel Dismun. The problems facing China's young people in their
12:13.060 - 12:18.540:  search for work are well documented. Now, the authorities have stopped publishing the unemployment
12:18.540 - 12:24.320:  figures for 16 to 24 year olds after the jobless rate for that demographic hit a record high
12:24.580 - 12:30.540:  of more than 20% in June. I asked Kerry Allen, our China media analyst, if the authorities have
12:30.540 - 12:35.760:  said why they haven't published the figures. Daniel Dismun. So, China's national bureau of statistics
12:35.760 - 12:40.420:  has said today that it's no longer going to be releasing information on this demographic and
12:40.420 - 12:45.400:  it's not set a timeline. It said that there's a need for further improvement and optimizing
12:45.400 - 12:51.460:  labour force survey statistics. And what they've specifically focused on. So Fulinghue, who's the
12:51.460 - 12:57.160:  spokesperson for the MBS, said that society has different views on whether students looking for
12:57.160 - 13:01.900:  jobs before graduation should be included in labour force surveys. And it's very much said that in
13:01.900 - 13:06.780:  recent years, the number of university students has continued to expand. So it's factoring in
13:07.560 - 13:12.060:  students who are studying and might be working at the same time. That seems to be the main reason
13:12.120 - 13:18.200:  for this. But obviously, with the statistics for unemployment being so high, there are questions
13:18.200 - 13:23.980:  about whether they're not publishing this because it's a very difficult thing to process that one
13:23.980 - 13:30.820:  in five young people between the ages of 16 and 24 are unemployed. And what has been the reaction
13:30.820 - 13:36.540:  social media? Well, factoring in the social media is used by a lot of young people. I've seen
13:36.540 - 13:41.280:  tens of thousands of social media comments today on the platform Weibo, which is like Facebook.
13:41.800 - 13:47.380:  And lots of young people basically saying, are the authority scared? Is unemployment scary high?
13:47.800 - 13:53.740:  Are they spooked by unemployment data? And one social media comment I've seen with hundreds of
13:54.020 - 13:59.180:  likes has been, if you delete this question over unemployment, then the problem will be solved.
13:59.180 - 14:04.840:  The idea that if you close your eyes on this, you're not going to be able to see the results of
14:04.840 - 14:10.980:  this and just how bad the problem is. These unemployment figures, do these just refer
14:10.980 - 14:16.880:  though to cities not to rural areas? They do, yes. So that's another reason why this methodology
14:16.880 - 14:22.440:  might be being changed. And one thing we have to factor in is that these figures have only really
14:22.440 - 14:28.060:  been processed since 2018. And in recent years, we've seen the COVID-19 virus and China had a
14:28.060 - 14:33.040:  strict zero COVID policy, meaning that a lot of young people were at home. They were in their
14:33.040 - 14:37.520:  hometowns. And obviously, over the last few years, employment trends have been changing. You've
14:37.520 - 14:42.280:  got a lot of people doing flexible work, a lot of people working from home. So this might be another
14:42.280 - 14:47.300:  reason why this data is being changed. Or, you know, for now, it's being suspended. And the
14:47.300 - 14:50.080:  government are thinking more about how they might process this data.
14:50.540 - 14:55.980:  Kerry Allen are China media analyst. Spain are through to the final of the women's world
14:55.980 - 15:00.680:  carp after their two won win over Sweden in a semi final in Auckland, New Zealand.
15:01.300 - 15:05.420:  Our sports reporter Katie Smith followed the match from a fan zone in Sydney.
15:05.960 - 15:11.360:  It means that Spain are into the final for the very first time. And once again, Sweden fall
15:11.360 - 15:15.620:  at this hurdle, the perennial bridesmaids never the brides. They talked about this previous
15:15.620 - 15:20.980:  history of making the semis never the final. And it has happened once again. It's a hard old game,
15:20.980 - 15:25.000:  isn't it sport? So Spain will play the winners of tomorrow's game. Of course,
15:25.000 - 15:31.100:  between England and the co-hosts Australia. That's pretty exciting for the host country, isn't it?
15:31.980 - 15:36.740:  Yeah, this is the big one. The Matilda's who are now stopping the nation, breaking records,
15:36.740 - 15:42.460:  TV viewing figures, left, right and center. They stopped the six o'clock news on Saturday. It was
15:42.480 - 15:47.260:  pushed back. That never happens on Channel 7. Stadiums have been open just to watch this
15:47.260 - 15:53.920:  match. And now they are playing arch historic sporting rivals England. And just to add to the drama,
15:54.660 - 15:59.620:  Australia are the only team under Serena Vigman's tenure as the England boss for the European
15:59.620 - 16:04.560:  Champions. Australia, the only team who have ever beaten them. This is massive. The Matilda's have
16:04.560 - 16:09.300:  never been in the semi-finals before. They've never been to the final. And England are coming in
16:09.620 - 16:13.440:  with that mantle of the European Champions. They should be just like favorites, although they're
16:13.440 - 16:18.960:  missing some key players, including Lauren James, who's still serving a red card ban. It's going to
16:18.960 - 16:23.240:  be so massive. And the crowd, the excitement here in the country is just huge.
16:23.380 - 16:28.880:  What are people saying to you, as you said, during a fan zone with Matilda fans? What are they saying?
16:28.900 - 16:34.320:  Well, a lot of them were watching the match tonight saying the tension of this was already
16:34.320 - 16:38.400:  I suppose stressing them out because they know it's to come tomorrow. They already had to live
16:38.400 - 16:43.960:  through that nail-biting penalty shooter against France to reach the semi-finals. That almost felt
16:43.960 - 16:48.820:  like a hurdle moment for them. I think they're slightly hoping that they won't have to succumb to that
16:49.060 - 16:59.120:  England. Katie Smith in Australia. Coming up in this podcast, they look pretty much like they
16:59.120 - 17:07.580:  can't be steady on their feet. Their lower lips start to droop and they are slow.
17:08.340 - 17:13.660:  The drunken monkey experiment that could help provide a cure for alcohol addiction.
17:20.440 - 17:25.020:  What in the world is the podcast exploring the stories and the issues that you need to know about?
17:25.020 - 17:32.600:  93% of past fashion workers aren't getting paid a living wage. The former president is accused of
17:32.640 - 17:38.200:  trying to overturn democracy. How do we leave athletes train in and around their menstrual cycle?

18:25.660 - 18:30.900:  Welcome back. Next to Ecuador, where another politician has been assassinated and then run
18:30.900 - 18:36.760:  up to a presidential election due to be held next week. Pedro Breonez was an organizer for the
18:36.760 - 18:42.000:  Left Wing Citizens Revolution Party. The killing comes soon after a presidential candidate was
18:42.000 - 18:46.720:  killed in the capital, Quito. Phoebe Hobson told us more about the situation left.
18:47.280 - 18:52.060:  Ecuador is going to vote in presidential elections on Sunday and this assassination of Pedro
18:52.060 - 18:56.880:  Breonez, who was a senior left-wing politician in the northern state of Esmeraldas. He was
18:56.880 - 19:01.040:  believed to have been shot on Monday evening, the details of which are still a little bit unclear,
19:01.600 - 19:07.400:  but it's believed he was shot in a park in the Parishana San Mateo. His death was announced by
19:07.460 - 19:12.060:  the current presidential front runner, Luisa González, who said that Ecuador is experiencing
19:12.060 - 19:17.800:  its most bloody period. This is because his death comes less than a week after a presidential
19:17.820 - 19:23.240:  candidate, Fernando Villavi Sencio, was assassinated after a political rally in Quito.
19:24.880 - 19:28.300:  It makes a total of three politicians to have been assassinated in the run up to the elections.
19:28.300 - 19:33.780:  A local mayor was also assassinated and these deaths are believed to be linked to very powerful
19:33.780 - 19:38.740:  organized crime groups that operate in the country. Just some context for people who might not know,
19:38.740 - 19:43.820:  you know, Ecuador is a country of 18 million people. It sits on the west coast of South America
19:43.820 - 19:49.200:  and it gets its name from the equator, which is its location. Until the last few years, it was very
19:49.640 - 19:53.900:  considered a reasonably peaceful country in comparison to its name of Colombia. Many people might
19:53.900 - 19:59.140:  visit it for the Galapagos Islands. Now, more powerful drug cartels are taking control of the
19:59.140 - 20:03.340:  country and the President Guillermo Lasso has said the elections will go forward on Sunday,
20:03.340 - 20:07.620:  but there is a two-month state of emergency and increased security around polling stations.
20:08.280 - 20:13.440:  Phoebe Hobson. A powerful slow-moving storm is battering central Japan with
20:13.440 - 20:19.120:  torrential rainfall and high winds. As we record this podcast, Japan is urging people to say
20:19.120 - 20:24.440:  vigilant as landslide and flood warnings are in place. Several people have been injured as
20:24.440 - 20:30.300:  Lorbica reports. Typhoon land made landfall around 400 kilometers south west of Tokyo,
20:30.300 - 20:36.360:  lashing much of central and western Japan with heavy rain and powerful winds. Authorities have
20:36.360 - 20:42.600:  issued several flood and landslide warnings and forecasters predict that the central Tokai region
20:42.860 - 20:47.880:  will be hit by three times the average rainfall for the whole of August in just 24 hours.
20:48.600 - 20:54.080:  Hundreds of people were stranded in Kansai airport overnight after road and rail routes were cut
20:54.080 - 21:00.260:  off. Lorbica. Now, what was the last content you accessed on a digital platform?
21:00.260 - 21:06.060:  You could have been playing a song, watching a film or looking at videos. All of these things
21:06.060 - 21:11.680:  have algorithms, computer systems that follow a set of instructions to solve a problem that give
21:11.680 - 21:17.800:  us recommendations on what we might want to watch, read or listen to next. But how much to these
21:17.800 - 21:23.040:  algorithms actually know about us? Could streaming services, for example, know your sexuality
21:23.040 - 21:29.040:  without being told? Well, BBC journalist Ellie House has been finding out in an edition of
21:29.040 - 21:35.420:  The Documentary did big tech know I was gay before I did. Ellie told us this all started
21:35.420 - 21:42.920:  from her own personal experience. So I'm bisexual, but I didn't always know that. It wasn't until my
21:42.920 - 21:47.580:  second year of university that I worked it out. And I remember at the time that I was getting lots
21:47.580 - 21:53.140:  of recommendations for new series with lesbian storylines or bisexual characters.
21:53.940 - 21:58.100:  These were pretty good TV series or movies, and I just assumed that everyone my age was seeing
21:58.100 - 22:02.900:  them. You know, why would I be different? But when I mentioned it to friends, people who are just
22:02.900 - 22:08.300:  like me, nobody knew what I was talking about. And then six months later, I realised that I was by,
22:08.300 - 22:14.060:  and it really felt like Netflix had worked it out before me. After that, I noticed the same thing
22:14.060 - 22:19.320:  happening across my social media and streaming platforms. So Spotify pushed me a playlist it
22:19.320 - 22:24.460:  described as sapphic, which means women who love women. And after a couple of months of scrolling
22:24.460 - 22:30.020:  on TikTok, I was getting really specific videos on my for you page, which is basically a feed of
22:30.020 - 22:35.020:  recommended content about being a bi woman in a relationship with a man, which I was at the time.
22:35.740 - 22:40.820:  When all of this happened, I decided to go on a quest to find out a bit more about the technology
22:40.820 - 22:46.180:  that's working behind the scenes to make these suggestions. Now, it's important to say that
22:46.180 - 22:51.120:  none of these companies collect personal information like this, and they say that they don't infer
22:51.120 - 22:57.320:  it either. But what they do do is try and work out what sort of things we'd be interested in seeing,
22:57.320 - 23:04.300:  which might be LGBT content. And it all starts with basic recommended systems, which in its simplest
23:04.300 - 23:09.880:  form is you've watched an action film, so you'll get recommended more action films and maybe less
23:09.880 - 23:15.180:  romantic comedies. And for most of these big platforms, the technology is far far far more
23:15.180 - 23:19.860:  advanced than that. They use what's called collaborative filtering. And this is where it gets
23:19.860 - 23:25.500:  interesting. So this is Marcel Karowski. He's a data scientist working in recommended systems.
23:26.480 - 23:36.180:  It exploits patterns of user behavior. How have users, so watchers or listeners or readers
23:37.100 - 23:42.740:  interacted with items? So songs, playlists, articles, movies, for example.
23:43.160 - 23:49.360:  But it goes even beyond this. So often the information that is more or just as useful for one of
23:49.360 - 23:54.760:  these recommended systems to work out what we might be interested in seeing is not what we've
23:54.760 - 24:01.580:  been streaming. It's how we stream. So things that to us might seem meaningless, like what device
24:01.580 - 24:06.260:  we're using, whether we let something auto play or whether we click on it ourselves, what time
24:06.260 - 24:12.620:  of day we tend to watch or listen. This information can actually say quite a lot. And I asked Greg
24:12.620 - 24:17.960:  Sorapio Garcia, who is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, specialising in computational
24:18.020 - 24:23.320:  social psychology, what sort of signals I might have been giving that might have indicated my
24:23.320 - 24:30.600:  sexuality even when I didn't realise. Maybe it's literally the percentage of time you've stayed
24:30.600 - 24:36.160:  continuously watching, whether or not you go through the credits, whether or not you skip
24:36.160 - 24:41.460:  around, like within these episodes. All of these are like really tiny, very specific features
24:42.500 - 24:47.080:  that on their own, like don't really mean anything. But like if you take them as part of this
24:47.080 - 24:51.180:  larger constellation of data, yeah, you can make like really specific predictions.
24:51.980 - 24:57.140:  So when I was researching for this documentary, I saw so many articles from various different
24:57.140 - 25:03.140:  countries across the last five, maybe even ten years of people saying, Facebook seems to know I'm
25:03.140 - 25:08.160:  gay. Google seems to know I'm gay. My adverts are personalised. My recommendations are personalised.
25:08.160 - 25:13.680:  Everyone seems to know that I'm about my sexuality. That's really interesting. So it's definitely not
25:13.680 - 25:19.320:  just me. It's kind of seems to be a common experience. Ellie House, and you can listen to that edition
25:19.320 - 25:25.960:  of the documentary wherever you get your podcasts. Now to a potentially exciting gene therapy study
25:25.960 - 25:31.000:  that could ultimately offer hope for chronic alcohol addiction. The study involves
25:31.000 - 25:37.300:  McCack Monkeys and used gene therapy to influence an area of the brain that controls addiction
25:37.300 - 25:42.600:  and reward. Kathy Grant, professor of neuroscience at the University of Oregon in the United States,
25:42.600 - 25:49.120:  was one of the lead researchers and she told us more. We've been studying animals, drinking alcohol
25:49.120 - 25:56.140:  for some time. And in particular, my lab's been studying monkeys and how we introduce them to
25:56.140 - 26:03.360:  alcohol and then a proportion of them will become heavy drinkers, chronically heavy drinkers.
26:03.380 - 26:11.480:  That means they'll drink eight to ten drinks a day every day. And it models well the very heavy
26:11.480 - 26:19.480:  drinking and people. And one of the things we find with this very heavy drinking is in the brain,
26:19.760 - 26:30.360:  in an area that helps with motivation. It's primarily important that a neurotransmitter named dopamine.
26:31.140 - 26:34.400:  This is a drug your brain releases that makes you feel good, isn't it?
26:34.660 - 26:40.460:  Yes. And it becomes very, very low in heavy drinkers.
26:40.680 - 26:47.560:  And you've managed to artificially create dopamine release in the brains of these monkeys
26:47.560 - 26:50.680:  that were heavy drinkers. And that that seemed to cure them with their drinking.
26:51.060 - 26:57.340:  Yes. So with this work on humans. We don't know that yet. But it was a proof of principle study
26:57.660 - 27:06.600:  and it's very encouraging. And it certainly suggests that this could be a treatment for individuals
27:06.600 - 27:13.640:  where all of our other treatment approaches are just not working for some chronic heavy drinkers.
27:13.640 - 27:17.580:  Because it is brain surgery and that is a fairly major intervention, isn't it?
27:17.860 - 27:21.240:  Exactly. It's invasive and it's irreversible.
27:21.600 - 27:23.440:  What do drunken monkeys look like?
27:24.860 - 27:32.560:  They look pretty much like they can't be steady on their feet. Their lower lips start to
27:32.560 - 27:38.560:  droop a little bit and they are slow in their actions.
27:38.860 - 27:40.720:  Are there ethical concerns doing this?
27:41.140 - 27:48.280:  Of course. The research is highly regulated. We would only do this research because the information
27:48.280 - 27:54.660:  we're getting from the monkeys is something we cannot get ethically from humans.
27:55.240 - 28:00.000:  But the potential for this, if it were to work in humans, is enormous, isn't it?
28:00.240 - 28:07.240:  Yes. There is about 2.4 million people worldwide that died from chronic alcohol use.
28:07.600 - 28:08.060:  Each year?
28:08.660 - 28:09.120:  Each year.
28:10.000 - 28:11.380:  And this holds that hope for them?
28:11.880 - 28:21.280:  Yes. We hope so. These individuals that just cannot stop drinking will end up killing themselves
28:21.280 - 28:24.440:  with the alcohol if there isn't an intervention.
28:24.960 - 28:28.900:  Professor Kathy Grant from the University of Oregon speaking there to Alex Ritson.
28:29.900 - 28:34.260:  The Oscar-winning film The Blind Side was billed as an inspirational true story,
28:34.260 - 28:39.340:  but the man whose life it was based on now says he was exploited by the family who he believed
28:39.340 - 28:43.220:  wrongly had adopted him. This report from Charlotte Gallagher.
28:43.820 - 28:44.200:  Big Mike.
28:45.780 - 28:49.780:  Hey, my name's Lee and two of my kids go to Wingate. You said you were going to the gym.
28:50.280 - 28:51.540:  Do you have any place to say tonight?
28:52.340 - 28:53.240:  Don't you dare lie to me.
28:53.400 - 28:57.520:  The Blind Side tells the rags to riches story of Michael O.F.,
28:57.560 - 29:04.180:  a black foster child who's adopted by a wealthy white family and becomes an American football star.
29:04.180 - 29:10.140:  It was a huge success and Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for her portrayal of Leigh-Anne Twoey,
29:10.140 - 29:16.660:  Michael's adoptive mother. But Michael is now alleging he was never adopted by the Twoey family,
29:17.120 - 29:19.080:  but tricked into a conservatorship.
29:19.520 - 29:24.440:  He says Leigh-Anne Twoey and her husband Sean made millions of dollars from his name.
29:25.160 - 29:30.600:  Conservatorships are court orders that appoint a parent or legal guardian to oversee the
29:30.600 - 29:36.080:  personal or financial affairs of someone incapable of fully managing them because of their age
29:36.080 - 29:42.100:  or disability. They've been in the news a lot because Britney Spears had one until 2021 and was
29:42.100 - 29:47.360:  incredibly unhappy about it. Court documents filed in the US State of Tennessee
29:47.380 - 29:53.580:  alleged that where other parents of Michael's classmates saw Michael simply as a nice kid in need,
29:53.580 - 29:59.880:  the Twoey saw something else, a gullible young man whose athletic talent could be exploited
29:59.880 - 30:05.440:  for their own benefit. Michael O.F. is asking the court to terminate the conservatorship,
30:05.820 - 30:11.720:  bar the Twoey's from continuing to profit from his name and likeness and establish how much money
30:11.720 - 30:16.680:  he says he's owed. He says that while the Twoey's made millions from the Blind Side,
30:16.680 - 30:22.960:  he received nothing. The Twoey family haven't responded to the BBC but told a local newspaper
30:22.960 - 30:28.740:  they hadn't made any money from the film, only a share of proceeds from a book the movie was
30:28.740 - 30:34.300:  based on. They said they were devastated, adding it's upsetting to think we would make money
30:34.300 - 30:37.240:  of any of our children. Charlotte Gallagher
30:39.860 - 30:43.300:  And that's it from us for now but there'll be a new edition of the global news podcast later.
