00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:12.560:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
00:46.300 - 00:52.320:  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:55.200 - 00:59.940:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway and this edition is published in the early hours of Tuesday the 15th of August.
01:00.580 - 01:05.680:  Russia's central bank says it will hold an emergency meeting after the ruble fell to a 17-month
01:05.680 - 01:10.880:  low against the dollar. There's been international condemnation of threats by the co-leaders in Niger
01:10.880 - 01:16.580:  to charge the deposed president with treason. And a fake document sparks a flurry of speculation
01:16.580 - 01:25.660:  about new criminal charges against Donald Trump. Also in the podcast, a US court rules in favour
01:25.660 - 01:31.240:  of 16 young people who accused the authorities in Montana of violating their rights by proving
01:31.240 - 01:40.340:  fossil fuel projects. And it's like a spirit in that wrong that just feels very comforting and
01:40.340 - 01:46.960:  a little bit overwhelming. From Beyonc√© to the Beatles, saving the recording studios that hosted
01:46.960 - 01:56.900:  generations of pop stars. When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year,
01:56.900 - 02:02.740:  it became the most sanctioned nation on earth. There was plenty of speculation that the Russian
02:02.740 - 02:08.380:  economy would be brought to its knees, but the Kremlin found ways around the embargoes,
02:08.540 - 02:15.800:  and Russian GDP fell by just 2.1% last year. However, the pain couldn't be avoided forever,
02:16.160 - 02:22.200:  and on Monday, the ruble fell to its lowest level for nearly 17 months at more than 100 to a dollar,
02:22.640 - 02:28.520:  compared to an average of 74 rubles per dollar the year before the war. These people in Moscow
02:28.520 - 02:34.240:  gave their reaction. Of course, this isn't happening because everything becomes more and more
02:34.240 - 02:39.920:  expensive. I wish our salaries grew the same as the dollar exchange rate does, then we wouldn't
02:39.920 - 02:49.560:  have any problems. But as a whole, rising prices affect everything. It's not the first time this has
02:49.560 - 02:55.380:  happened. Today is Monday, so I think by the end of the week there will be a dollar fall again.
02:57.160 - 03:01.920:  I asked our correspondent in Moscow, Will Vernon, what this all means for people living in Russia.
03:02.400 - 03:07.160:  The fall in the ruble will hurt people here. It's likely that inflation will increase, foreign
03:07.160 - 03:12.960:  travel will become more expensive for ordinary Russians. But if you watch state TV and you get a
03:12.960 - 03:17.020:  completely different picture, you know, the presenter on the Russia 24 channel that I was watching
03:17.020 - 03:23.700:  earlier did indeed say that the ruble had gone to 101 rubles and quite an eye-watering rate.
03:24.240 - 03:28.700:  But he then went on to say that actually the Russian economy is doing pretty well, that Russian
03:28.700 - 03:35.060:  GDP is up and that oil and gas revenues are growing. And I was reading come to Moscow after the
03:35.060 - 03:40.800:  main tabloid in Russia. And they declared on their third page that the Russian economy had taken
03:40.800 - 03:46.960:  a sharp upward turn. But actually a little earlier I was also speaking to a travel agent who
03:46.960 - 03:53.100:  owns a big travel agency in Moscow. He thinks that this will lead to more people going on holiday
03:53.100 - 03:58.280:  inside Russia instead of traveling abroad. But actually overseas travel was already very
03:58.280 - 04:03.900:  difficult for Russians. There has been a slight correction today in the ruble rate this afternoon and
04:03.900 - 04:08.640:  now it has gone down below 100 rubles to the dollar again. But we'll have to see what happens
04:08.640 - 04:13.860:  in the coming days. Yeah, the ruble strengthened it seems after the central bank said it was going
04:13.860 - 04:19.060:  to meet tomorrow to discuss interest rates. Might we see a hike in interest rates and is that
04:19.060 - 04:22.700:  something that will worry people in Russia? I think that's possible. You know, I think the central
04:22.700 - 04:27.820:  bank will be keen to try and keep inflation under control. You know, it's quite interesting. I've
04:27.820 - 04:32.840:  been talking to a lot of people in Moscow over the last few days, asking them, are they worried
04:32.840 - 04:38.700:  about the economy? Do they feel nervous about the drone attacks on Moscow? Are they concerned that
04:38.720 - 04:43.980:  you'd get any pre-gusion in his Wagner mercenaries could stage another mutiny? And the most
04:43.980 - 04:49.360:  common response is a sort of shrug. People don't seem that worried if you ask them about specific
04:49.360 - 04:54.840:  events. But if you ask them more generally, are they fearful about the future and about the conflict
04:54.840 - 05:00.380:  in Ukraine? And almost everyone, even if they seem to support the war or support the Kremlin,
05:00.380 - 05:07.380:  that they say yes, they are very concerned. Will Vernon in Moscow? There's been widespread condemnation
05:07.380 - 05:12.860:  of threats by the coup leaders in Niger to put the deposed president on trial for high treason.
05:12.860 - 05:17.880:  The military say they have enough evidence to prosecute the democratically elected leader,
05:17.880 - 05:22.160:  Mohammed Bazoum. The US said it was incredibly dismayed by the announcement,
05:22.160 - 05:27.600:  while the West African regional block Ekoos said it contradicted the junters reported willingness
05:27.600 - 05:35.000:  to fight a peaceful solution. And here's UN spokesman Stefan Duzarek. It's obviously very
05:35.000 - 05:40.940:  worrying declaration. We remain extremely concerned about the state of being, the health
05:40.940 - 05:47.680:  and safety of the president and his family. And again, we call for his immediate and unconditional
05:48.300 - 05:54.020:  release. Professor Quesi Aning from the Kofi and Anne International Peacekeeping Training Center
05:54.020 - 05:59.200:  in Ghana said it looked like the coup leaders in Niger were trying to vindicate their actions.
05:59.780 - 06:07.720:  The shift from the argument around corruption to one of high treason suddenly elevates the narrative
06:07.720 - 06:14.880:  from the coup makers to one of protecting the sanctity of the state. But this is all part of the
06:14.880 - 06:21.620:  game in seeking justify why the coup has to be in place. The deputy director at Human Rights Watch
06:21.620 - 06:29.320:  Africa, Karin Kanazat, Nantulia, said it wasn't clear what kind of trial President Bazoum might face.
06:30.100 - 06:34.900:  In terms of the potential charge that has been talked about, we also concerned that this might be
06:34.900 - 06:40.040:  a politically motivated charge, given the length and the nature of President Bazoum's detention
06:40.040 - 06:44.760:  and the other court detainees. We are also concerned about the independence of the court,
06:45.180 - 06:50.680:  and we're also calling for respect of the due process rights of President Bazoum and his
06:50.680 - 06:57.780:  court detainees. Karin Kanazat, Nantulia talking to the BBC. The junta accuses President Bazoum
06:57.780 - 07:03.600:  of undermining security there. However, his campaign against jihadist groups in Niger has actually
07:03.600 - 07:09.020:  been the most successful in the entire Sahel region. This information in Niger has been
07:09.020 - 07:15.060:  rife following the coup on the 26th of July, with a surge in fake news from places like Russia
07:15.060 - 07:20.640:  and China, according to American intelligence firm Logically. Our African regional editor,
07:20.640 - 07:22.480:  Richard Hamilton, takes up the story.
07:28.360 - 07:34.280:  This is a video that's been circulated on Twitter or X as it's now known. It shows men in
07:34.280 - 07:41.400:  military fatigues marching in a crowded football stadium. It's been viewed nearly 170,000 times
07:41.400 - 07:48.480:  and been reposted more than 1,000 times to show just how much public support the military junta has
07:48.480 - 07:54.920:  in Niger, except that the film doesn't come from Niger, but Bikina Faso, where a coup was staged
07:54.920 - 08:02.300:  in 2022. Kyle Walter is the head of research at Logically. His company works with governments and
08:02.300 - 08:08.520:  social media companies to weed out harmful online content. This video from Bikina Faso,
08:08.520 - 08:14.000:  showing people walking around a stadium to a large crowd that's showing widespread public support
08:14.000 - 08:18.440:  essentially for the coup. But what we can see from the video is that it's very clearly the leaders
08:18.660 - 08:22.540:  of the Bikina Faso coup from the year prior, based upon the uniforms that they're wearing,
08:22.540 - 08:26.440:  based upon the hats that they have on, and based upon the prominent figures from that coup,
08:26.440 - 08:30.100:  we can tell that this is actually from that conflict rather than from the coup in Niger.
08:30.500 - 08:37.280:  Logically found that the number of posts mentioning Niger spiked on social media in the days after
08:37.280 - 08:42.960:  the coup on the 26th of July. From then until the 9th of August, the word Niger was mentioned
08:42.960 - 08:51.040:  more than 5 million times and was shared by nearly 800,000 individual users. Other fake material
08:51.040 - 08:57.760:  that the company has analysed include a video purporting to show Niger's finance minister crying
08:57.760 - 09:04.140:  after the coup. Images recorded in Nigeria passed off as footage of military training in Niger
09:04.860 - 09:10.980:  and a film clip from Sudan that makes it look as if Wagner mercenaries are actually in Niger.
09:11.260 - 09:17.940:  Kyle Walter explains the verifying process. You're going to be looking for key indicators to try
09:17.940 - 09:23.460:  to be able to identify where the video was filmed. Geolocating is the act of using unique identifiers
09:23.460 - 09:28.200:  from a video and cross-referencing them with other publicly available information that we have. So
09:28.560 - 09:32.800:  if you see a video filmed and it's got a gas station located in the distance and you can see
09:32.800 - 09:37.200:  cross-street and other landmarks and you can cross-reference that to publicly available images
09:37.480 - 09:41.440:  of the alleged location that they're claiming it was filmed at, then you can confirm or deny
09:41.440 - 09:46.300:  whether or not the film is actually from that location. Apart from visual images, the company has
09:46.300 - 09:52.880:  also uncovered a wealth of text-based narratives such as claims that the junta was going to arrest
09:52.880 - 09:58.940:  all European nationals in the country and that the French embassy had been completely destroyed.
09:59.740 - 10:05.520:  Niger may be a landlocked country but it's currently swimming in a sea of disinformation,
10:05.520 - 10:13.240:  propaganda and lies. Africa, regional editor Richard Hamilton. There is huge speculation that
10:13.240 - 10:18.820:  Donald Trump is about to be charged in a fourth criminal case. So when a document popped up online
10:18.820 - 10:23.400:  claiming the state of Georgia was inditing him for racketeering, it seemed plausible.
10:23.420 - 10:28.880:  The case, which is being looked at by a grand jury in the state at the moment, relates to claims
10:28.880 - 10:34.920:  that the former president committed election fraud by trying to, quote, find nearly 12,000 votes he
10:34.920 - 10:40.360:  needed to beat Joe Biden. However, the court later said the document referring to the charges was
10:40.360 - 10:45.780:  fictitious. The BBC's North America editor Sarah Smith is in Georgia with the latest.
10:46.120 - 10:50.820:  All the signs are that there will be fresh charges laid against Donald Trump very soon now and
10:50.820 - 10:55.120:  that will of course be the fourth criminal indictment against the former president.
10:55.500 - 10:59.820:  There was briefly a great flurry of excitement here a few hours ago when it looked like the
10:59.820 - 11:04.460:  charges had appeared on the court's website but it turned out that that really was fake news.
11:04.460 - 11:09.900:  So we don't know exactly what he's likely to be accused of but it will relate to election fraud
11:10.360 - 11:15.500:  and attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election here in the state of Georgia.
11:16.120 - 11:21.260:  Because this is where Mr. Trump and his allies concentrated a huge amount of their efforts
11:21.260 - 11:26.620:  after the election claiming falsely that hundreds of thousands of fake ballots had been counted
11:26.620 - 11:32.120:  in Joe Biden's favour. And this is where Donald Trump phoned the senior election official and asked
11:32.120 - 11:38.840:  him to find just enough votes to tip the state in his favour. And you'll remember it was actually
11:38.840 - 11:44.260:  less than a fortnight ago that Donald Trump appeared in court in Washington on totally separate
11:44.260 - 11:50.600:  charges of election fraud and he is of course still facing prosecution in Florida over retention
11:50.600 - 11:56.300:  of classified documents and in New York over hush money payments. So there are a lot of court
11:56.300 - 12:02.640:  cases stacking up for him but he is as defiant as ever and he said on social media today that he
12:02.640 - 12:07.020:  didn't tamper with the election results here in Georgia the people who tampered with them were the
12:07.020 - 12:11.720:  ones who rigged the election that's what he's claiming. On North America editor Sarah Smith
12:12.660 - 12:18.100:  in what's being called a game changer for climate activism in the US a judge has ruled in favor
12:18.100 - 12:23.420:  of a group of young people who sued the state of Montana for violating their right to a clean
12:23.420 - 12:29.180:  and helpful environment. The details from we're a Davis. The case was brought by a group of 16
12:29.180 - 12:34.600:  young Montana residents and was reportedly the first of its kind in the United States. They
12:34.600 - 12:39.420:  argue that the state must do more to consider how emissions are contributing to droughts,
12:39.420 - 12:44.740:  wildfires and other growing environmental threats. In her ruling the district court judge
12:44.740 - 12:50.320:  Kathy Ceeley found the Montana's emissions were proven to be a substantial factor in adversely
12:50.320 - 12:55.940:  affecting the climate. She also ruled that laws limiting the ability of regulators to consider
12:55.940 - 13:01.500:  climate effects were unconstitutional because its citizens had a right under the constitution
13:01.500 - 13:07.640:  to a clean and helpful environment. A spokesperson for the group that brought the case said it was
13:07.640 - 13:13.280:  a huge win for Montana its youth and the climate and while the ruling won't prevent mining or
13:13.280 - 13:18.540:  burning fossil fuels in the state commentator said it would require the consideration of
13:18.540 - 13:24.780:  planet warming pollutants when considering fossil fuel projects in the future. The state is
13:24.780 - 13:31.140:  expected to appeal the ruling. We're a Davis. The English Premier League began at the weekend but
13:31.140 - 13:37.400:  some very big football transfer business is still going on. A 21 year old Ecuadorian who
13:37.400 - 13:43.220:  started playing on scrub land outside his hometown has just become the most expensive player ever
13:43.520 - 13:49.380:  in Britain. Moises Caesado who has been with Brighton for two seasons is going to Chelsea for
13:49.380 - 13:56.840:  almost $146 million. Brighton bought him for just over $5 million. Our sports correspondent Joe
13:56.840 - 14:04.000:  Linsky has the details. Moises Caesado was born in Santo Domingo Ecuador. He was the youngest of
14:04.000 - 14:10.580:  10 siblings and learned his trade on scrub pitches but from a young age he was set to be a star.
14:10.720 - 14:16.580:  He's not a regular scorer but he changes teams from midfield. At his first senior club
14:16.580 - 14:23.640:  independiente his teammates nicknamed him the octopus. It is that combative style that Chelsea
14:23.640 - 14:29.840:  feel they're missing. When Brighton brought him to England in 2021 he was already an Ecuador
14:29.840 - 14:35.320:  international. He made his Premier League break through last season where he was key to his team
14:35.320 - 14:40.140:  finishing sixth and qualifying for Europe. A bit of speed here but he's going to get into the
14:40.140 - 14:47.220:  middle of the area, lays it up. Caesado to one person. Chelsea's owner is the American Todd Bowling
14:47.280 - 14:53.480:  and this deal will take spending on transfer since he took over beyond 800 million pounds.
14:53.500 - 14:59.720:  Premier League clubs now have to operate within UEFA's financial fair play rules aimed at making
14:59.720 - 15:05.840:  sure they operate on a similar playing field and if they don't they risk a fine. But that's not
15:05.840 - 15:11.740:  stopped clubs breaking transfer records this summer. Declan Rice signed for Arsenal for 105
15:11.740 - 15:19.140:  million pounds and in January Chelsea spend 106 million on Enzo Fernandez. Those fees are a
15:19.140 - 15:25.920:  reflection of more clubs with big aspirations and in some cases rich owners or competing for the
15:25.920 - 15:32.100:  world's best. Joe Linsky reporting. Meanwhile the player who was once the most expensive in the world
15:32.100 - 15:37.500:  is also on the move. The Brazilian name R is being sold by the French side Paris Saint-Germain
15:37.500 - 15:44.380:  to the Saudi Arabian team Al Helaal for almost $100 million. The 31-year-old set a world record
15:44.380 - 15:49.680:  when PSG bought him six years ago for about $254 million.
15:53.580 - 15:58.360:  And still to come on the global news podcast. We set out from Plymouth just like Joe
15:58.360 - 16:03.340:  Starwind did. We go down the Atlantic down the coast of South America, up the West Coast of South
16:03.340 - 16:08.180:  America, across the Pacific to Australia and then back again via Nepal and the Cape of Good Hope.
16:08.560 - 16:13.080:  The hand-baked group retracing the extraordinary journey of Charles Darwin.
16:22.740 - 16:28.520:  The Shah Chirag, more salim in southern Iran, is considered one of the most important in Shia Islam.
16:28.520 - 16:36.100:  Last year a mass shooting there claimed by the Sunni-Jihadist group Islamic State killed 13 people.
16:36.660 - 16:42.540:  Iran recently publicly hanged two men over that attack. On Sunday a government attacked the
16:42.540 - 16:47.960:  Shrine again, killing two people. On Monday the Iranian security forces said they had arrested
16:47.960 - 16:53.840:  eight foreigners. Kasra Najee from the BBC Persian Service told me more about the main suspect.
16:54.260 - 17:00.300:  The attacker who was arrested yesterday, today the Iranian authorities say that he
17:00.300 - 17:06.160:  is from Tajikistan, from Badakhshan. Earlier on they said he was Afghan but then the
17:06.160 - 17:12.420:  corrected themselves saying that he was a national of Tajikistan in Central Asia. We know now that
17:12.420 - 17:20.100:  two people have been killed and six people injured. One attacker we see on CCTV or although there
17:20.100 - 17:26.980:  were reports that there were two attackers. They arrested him. The CCTV, the pictures are quite
17:26.980 - 17:32.520:  shocking in a sense that he moves in with the clash neck off and he starts shooting at everything
17:32.520 - 17:40.140:  in front of him and it's a miracle that not many more people than two were killed and the six
17:40.140 - 17:46.040:  injured. Of course last year we saw a worse attack there. Why is this Shrine in particular targeted?
17:46.040 - 17:53.380:  Is this an attempt for meant trouble between the Shia majority in Iran and the Sunni minority perhaps?
17:53.620 - 17:58.700:  It's not quite clear why they are targeting this particular Shrine. There was an attack
17:58.700 - 18:07.520:  on the Shrine last year in October, 13 people were killed then, 25 injured. Their responsibility was
18:07.520 - 18:16.080:  taken by ISIS. At this time no group, no person has taken responsibility so far which is strange
18:16.700 - 18:23.800:  but all in all it seems that Iran does have an ISIS problem because it just keeps happening as
18:23.800 - 18:29.980:  I said last year this thing happened four years ago. ISIS militants attacked a military parade
18:30.060 - 18:38.360:  killing 24 people. A year before that they attacked the building of Iran's parliament in Tehran.
18:38.360 - 18:46.340:  They killed 17 people so it just keeps happening and it's clear that it's a problem and it looks
18:46.340 - 18:55.080:  as if a lot of this is being imported from Afghanistan and in central Asia where ISIS is still
18:55.080 - 19:01.160:  a pretty much active. Kazhranaji of the BBC Persian Service. The governor of the US
19:01.160 - 19:06.400:  state of Hawaii has warned that it could take up to 10 more days to learn the full human cost of
19:06.400 - 19:12.920:  the devastating wildfires that Albert destroyed the historic town of Lahaina. Josh Green said recovery
19:12.920 - 19:19.620:  crews scouring the remains of burnt out buildings and vehicles are likely to find around 10 to 20
19:19.620 - 19:27.280:  more victims every day, meaning the current figure of 96 killed could easily double. The island's
19:27.280 - 19:33.180:  chief of police has appealed to those with missing relatives to submit DNA samples to speed up
19:33.180 - 19:39.660:  identification. From the island of Maui here's our correspondent Jon Sudworth. Slowly the signs of
19:39.660 - 19:45.720:  US government assistance are becoming more visible. The National Guard on checkpoints for buying up
19:45.720 - 19:51.980:  of hotel rooms to re-house the homeless and the arrival of more experts to help with the daunting
19:51.980 - 19:58.720:  task of combing through the scorched remains including dentists needed to help identify the victims.
19:59.920 - 20:05.780:  Les Mann who lived in Lahaina and who barely escaped with his own life is now wondering about
20:05.780 - 20:11.480:  the fate of a neighbor. And I saw her door open. I'm like come on out of there I said you know there's
20:11.520 - 20:15.900:  firebacks like but she wouldn't come out and I'm rattling her door like come out but she has it
20:15.940 - 20:21.700:  locked so I'm coughing at that point I can't talk and now I can't see so I just stumbled my way out
20:21.700 - 20:27.860:  so I'm like if she's in there you know what are her chances to survive that hundreds of people
20:27.860 - 20:33.760:  are still listed as missing. Hawaii's governor Josh Green says it may be some time before the final
20:33.760 - 20:39.960:  cost in human life is known. They will find 10 to 20 people per day probably until they finish
20:40.240 - 20:45.860:  and it's probably going to take 10 days it's impossible to guess really and an interesting thing
20:45.860 - 20:52.120:  and a tragic thing in here is we're not treating more first, second and third degree burns because
20:52.220 - 20:59.120:  the fire was so perilous that it took lives. Tourists are being urged not to visit the island of Maui
20:59.120 - 21:05.740:  so that accommodation can be provided for the emergency response. John's I'd worth in Hawaii. Well
21:05.740 - 21:11.840:  scorching wildfires have already wreaked havoc in parts of Canada, Greece, Italy, Portugal and
21:11.840 - 21:17.520:  Algeria this summer so aren't they becoming more frequent and intense and the earlier it is a
21:17.520 - 21:22.780:  wildfire expert at the University of Exeter. It is probably generally accepted that yes there are
21:22.780 - 21:28.600:  more wildfires but really the key difference is that the fires were seeing a much more intense and
21:28.600 - 21:34.060:  therefore much more difficult to suppress and control. We can continue to fight these fires as much
21:34.060 - 21:38.180:  as we like but the current state of them with the current intensity we're really not going to win
21:38.180 - 21:43.860:  that fight so we need to learn to manage the fires long before the ignition actually happens
21:44.420 - 21:50.100:  and that's about identifying areas and communities such as Leina that are at risk of wildfires
21:50.100 - 21:55.600:  and putting some mitigation measures in place around those towns and those vulnerable areas.
21:55.840 - 22:02.480:  Field management is the key one so simply by looking at satellite data Leina as an example
22:02.480 - 22:09.500:  appears to be abandoned agricultural land. This is land it was probably used to grow crops in the
22:09.500 - 22:14.880:  past would have been irrigated those crops would have been lush and green. That has been abandoned
22:14.880 - 22:20.560:  potentially because it became unviable possibly because the communities have moved to tourism which
22:20.560 - 22:25.960:  may be more lucrative. The net result though is that those areas are no longer irrigated so they're
22:25.960 - 22:32.020:  dry and the fine fuels the grasses and small shrubs that grow in their place are very flammable and
22:32.020 - 22:35.780:  when you have drought conditions such as the ones that they've experienced recently those
22:35.780 - 22:41.020:  feels quickly dry out and if there is an ignition source whether that's natural or man-made
22:41.020 - 22:46.120:  then those fires will be extremely intense and very difficult to suppress so it's about
22:46.120 - 22:52.600:  learning to identify and manage the risk. Wildfire experts Andrew Elliott, an Australian woman
22:52.600 - 22:58.040:  who cooked a beef Wellington using poisonous mushrooms which killed three relatives and left one
22:58.040 - 23:04.800:  critically ill has again said it was an accident. In a five-page statement to police 48-year-old
23:04.800 - 23:09.140:  Erin Patterson said she loved her family and wouldn't hurt them. From Sydney,
23:09.140 - 23:14.400:  here's Shemah Halil. Australia has been gripped by the mystery of the fatal lunch which Erin
23:14.400 - 23:19.160:  Patterson held at her home in the small town of Lee and Gatha in Victoria last month. She'd
23:19.160 - 23:24.720:  invited her estranged husbands parents Gayle and Don Patterson along with Mrs. Patterson's sister
23:24.720 - 23:29.740:  and her husband. Hours after the meal all four of her guests were taken to hospital,
23:29.740 - 23:34.860:  three died within a week and the fourth is in critical condition waiting for a liver transplant.
23:35.800 - 23:40.760:  In her police statement Erin Patterson who's not facing charges said that she'd used some dried
23:40.760 - 23:45.880:  mushrooms but did not know they were poisonous. She added that she was distraught that they may
23:45.880 - 23:50.700:  have contributed to the illness and suffering of her loved ones. Police believed the victims had
23:50.700 - 23:56.220:  eaten death-cap mushrooms which are lethal if ingested. Her statement to the Victoria police had
23:56.220 - 24:01.620:  not been publicly released but was reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and nine
24:01.620 - 24:07.020:  newspapers. The authorities are still waiting for a toxicology report. While Shemah
24:07.020 - 24:11.880:  intends her innocence, police say Ms. Patterson is still a suspect and that the deaths remain
24:11.880 - 24:19.200:  unexplained. Shemah, hello in Australia. A ship described as the world's most exciting classroom
24:19.200 - 24:24.500:  is embarking on a groundbreaking voyage across the world. It will retrace the route taken by
24:24.500 - 24:30.240:  Charles Darwin, whose book on the origin of species set out the theory of evolution. Andrew
24:30.240 - 24:36.900:  Peach spoke to Stuart McPherson, leader of the Darwin 200 project. We're taking this beautiful
24:36.900 - 24:42.220:  historic tour ship following Charles Darwin's journey around the world. We're selecting the very
24:42.220 - 24:47.540:  best young conservationist from across the world. We're selecting 200 of them and bringing
24:47.540 - 24:52.640:  them to the ship in the ports to do a really intense program of training to give them new skills
24:52.900 - 24:57.940:  and new experience to go back to their home countries to work for the next 50 years to change
24:57.980 - 25:03.480:  the world. That's a big objective. Just give us a bit more on how you're choosing the people
25:03.480 - 25:08.080:  and what you'll be trying to teach them, what skills you'll be trying to impart. These young people
25:08.080 - 25:14.020:  we call them Darwin leaders are very special. They're people that are born with the burning flame
25:14.020 - 25:19.420:  inside of them to change the world. Many of them have already done incredible things by their own
25:19.420 - 25:25.180:  initiative, planting thousands of trees or setting up conservation projects. Honestly, you wouldn't
25:25.180 - 25:30.100:  believe some of the achievements these young people have done, often as teenagers. We bring them to
25:30.100 - 25:35.120:  the ports basically in a nutshell. They've got to select an animal or plant that Charles Darwin
25:35.120 - 25:40.820:  studied and do three things. Firstly, work out what's happened in its habitat over the last 200
25:40.820 - 25:45.240:  years since Darwin saw it and visited what's changed with the population, how it's been impacted
25:45.240 - 25:50.180:  and the reasons why. They've then got to look at the current conservation work. Is it working?
25:50.180 - 25:55.680:  And if not why? And lastly, they've got to look to the future and work out new ways to help save
25:55.680 - 26:01.120:  that animal or plant and develop new ideas. What's the importance of Charles Darwin here? I get that
26:01.120 - 26:07.260:  it's his route, but I suspect that the shadow he casts over this whole project is much bigger than
26:07.260 - 26:11.840:  that. Many people remember Darwin as an old guy with a beard that wrote a book on evolution,
26:11.900 - 26:17.420:  but the reality is that he was 22 years old when he stepped aboard the Beagle and started
26:17.420 - 26:23.040:  journey around the world. He didn't just discover and study evolution. He studied a rainbow of other
26:23.040 - 26:28.540:  subjects from mountain formations to the formations of assholes to the role of earthworms forming soil
26:28.620 - 26:34.600:  and so many other subjects. This man changed the world with his mind and in a similar way we want
26:34.600 - 26:40.020:  to help create a better world by creating new minds and making new people think about the future.
26:40.540 - 26:45.880:  So what we're trying to do is create the drivers of change to have a ripple effect. So these young people
26:45.880 - 26:52.220:  there are between 18 and 25, they've already dedicated their lives to conservation. What we're trying
26:52.220 - 26:57.460:  to do is enhance them, give them new skills, new experience, new knowledge that they'll then take
26:57.460 - 27:03.400:  away. Can you imagine the impact of 200 of these incredible people in different parts of the world?
27:03.400 - 27:08.620:  I think 200 Jane Goodalls, 200 Sylvia Elves. But one of the key things is to meet each other.
27:08.760 - 27:12.900:  This is what advantage they'll have over even someone as amazing as Charles Darwin,
27:12.900 - 27:17.260:  they better have a network of people involved in similar work in different parts of the globe.
27:17.560 - 27:21.440:  That's absolutely right. It's when people come together, it's when organizations collaborate
27:21.440 - 27:26.720:  and work. That's when you get the synergy and that's when you get a multiplier effect of what can
27:26.720 - 27:30.280:  be achieved. Broadly, where does the route take their tour ship before it finishes?
27:30.840 - 27:35.680:  We set out from Plymouth just like Charles Darwin did nearly two centuries ago. We go down the Atlantic,
27:35.680 - 27:40.940:  visiting Canary Islands, Cape Verde and the coast of South America, up the west coast of South America,
27:41.380 - 27:46.020:  across the Pacific to Australia, and then back again via Leiporn and the Cape of Good Hope to
27:46.020 - 27:50.200:  Pharmath. We're going step to shore. Stuart McPherson talking to Andrew Peach.
27:51.360 - 27:57.160:  Finally, a former Edwardian era roller skating rink brought by the BBC in the 1930s,
27:57.160 - 28:02.780:  the made avail studios have seen performances by everyone from the Beatles and David Bowie to
28:02.780 - 28:08.660:  Beyonc√© and Adele. But now the West London venue has been sold for more than $13 million.
28:08.860 - 28:15.120:  The new owners include film composer Hans Zimmer as our Arts Correspondent Liza Mezimba reports.
28:15.600 - 28:17.560:  We're ready to pop in the pop-go-the-beatle spot.
28:22.420 - 28:28.160:  Over the years, the studios have played host to performances from some of music's biggest names.
28:29.660 - 28:33.920:  From the Beatles to David Bowie, I've never ever performed this in my life,
28:34.560 - 28:35.300:  until this minute.
28:40.620 - 28:42.800:  I'm from Blair to Beyonc√©.
28:43.100 - 28:50.020:  I love performing with with my band and it's like a spirit in that room that just feels
28:50.540 - 28:53.940:  very comforting and a little bit overwhelming.
28:54.320 - 28:57.400:  Bing Crosby's final recordings were made at made avail.
28:57.560 - 28:59.980:  Would you like to introduce the songs you have for us?
29:00.240 - 29:02.700:  We're going to open up, I suppose, the feels good, feels great.
29:02.980 - 29:05.000:  Three days before he died of a heart attack.
29:12.440 - 29:15.000:  It's been the home of the BBC Symphony Orchestra.
29:15.660 - 29:18.460:  It was where the famous John Peel sessions were recorded.
29:18.620 - 29:22.300:  Hello there boys and girls, and this program comes to you live from our made avail studios.
29:26.960 - 29:30.260:  And was the place where the BBC Radio Phonic workshop
29:30.640 - 29:32.980:  created the original Doctor Who Thee.
29:37.340 - 29:39.600:  The studio's future had been in doubt.
29:39.600 - 29:44.540:  After the BBC announced, it was moving its music operations from made avail
29:44.960 - 29:46.780:  to a new site in East London.
29:46.860 - 29:52.320:  The group, Buying the Studio, includes the film producers Tim Bevan and Eric Felner.
29:52.700 - 29:56.400:  Their company Working Title has produced successful British films,
29:56.400 - 29:59.840:  such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary.
30:00.220 - 30:02.980:  Along with Hank Zimmer, the Oscar-winning composer
30:03.420 - 30:06.240:  behind the music scores of the Dark Knight Trilogy,
30:06.640 - 30:09.500:  the Pirates of the Caribbean series and Gladiator.
30:10.720 - 30:14.200:  Zimmer, who first worked at the studio 45 years ago,
30:14.200 - 30:19.680:  described it as the place that kept a struggling musician like himself from giving up,
30:20.320 - 30:23.960:  and said that he wanted to ensure that the next generation
30:23.960 - 30:26.740:  had the same opportunities that he was given.
30:32.700 - 30:36.540:  And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
30:36.540 - 30:40.060:  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll and produced by Emma Joseph,
30:40.060 - 30:43.740:  our editor's Karen Martin. I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
