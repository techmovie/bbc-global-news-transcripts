00:48.980 - 00:52.360:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:53.920 - 00:56.680:  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Thursday,
00:56.680 - 01:00.100:  the 24th of August, these are our main stories.
01:00.700 - 01:06.420:  The world reacts to the suspected assassination of the warlord many Russians called a dead man walking
01:06.420 - 01:11.300:  as Vagna Bosjev, Geni Pregogin, is said to have been among those killed in a plane crash.
01:11.720 - 01:17.140:  We follow responses from Moscow and Kiev as Joe Biden gives his opinion from the US.
01:17.680 - 01:22.360:  Not much that happens in Russia in 2009, but I don't know enough to know the answer.
01:23.120 - 01:26.780:  And Donald Trump's former lawyer is booked on charges of a conspiracy
01:26.780 - 01:31.420:  to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.
01:33.400 - 01:34.660:  Also in this podcast,
01:34.660 - 01:38.140:  Romanian prosecutors share graphic evidence with the BBC
01:38.140 - 01:42.920:  related to their case against controversial online influencer Andrew Tate.
01:43.100 - 01:48.620:  And both will be sentenced at a later date for acting the court heard as digital bandits.
01:49.020 - 01:55.400:  The British teenagers who took on big techs, windling money using TVs and fire sticks.
01:59.180 - 02:03.940:  He went from being one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies to his arch enemy.
02:03.940 - 02:06.360:  And now, Yevgeni Pregogin could be dead.
02:06.500 - 02:11.660:  In an incident that unfolded exactly two months after he launched his failed attempt at a mutiny
02:11.660 - 02:17.140:  by marching on Moscow. There's a lot we still don't know, but what we do know is that a private
02:17.140 - 02:22.440:  jet owned by a company associated with this to Pregogin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group
02:22.440 - 02:27.140:  crashed near Moscow. Ten people were on board. And ten bodies have been found.
02:27.160 - 02:31.920:  Video shows the plane falling abruptly out of the sky and a fiery wreckage.
02:31.920 - 02:36.440:  The Russian Civil Aviation Authority has said that according to the plane's operator
02:36.440 - 02:40.620:  Pregogin was on board, along with his number two to meet Trey Utkin.
02:40.620 - 02:45.240:  The crash was announced without fanfare on the Russian State-owned news channel,
02:45.240 - 02:46.200:  Russia 24.
02:52.540 - 02:58.580:  A social media account linked to the Wagner group as alleged the jet was shot down by Russian air defense.
02:58.580 - 03:03.600:  It blamed traitors. Vitaly Shevchenko, Russia editor at BBC Monitoring,
03:03.860 - 03:05.800:  is following developments and told me more.
03:06.680 - 03:13.080:  The latest we have is that the search operation at the side of the crash is over.
03:13.080 - 03:20.940:  Ten bodies recovered. We have a statement published by a key telegram account,
03:20.940 - 03:27.420:  believed to be linked to Wagner, which said that both Pregogin and his right hand
03:27.420 - 03:35.480:  Trey Utkin are dead. What we don't have is any official word on whether
03:35.480 - 03:44.360:  Pregogin was actually on board that flight, because the mere fact that his name was on the list
03:44.400 - 03:51.760:  of people traveling on board that plane does mean he was there. But there is an increasing
03:51.760 - 03:59.080:  amount of unsourced reports coming from various websites, social media accounts,
03:59.100 - 04:06.480:  reasonably credible public figures in Russia saying that Pregogin is dead.
04:06.860 - 04:11.640:  And this suggestion from Wagner associates that it may have been shot down by Russian air defense
04:11.640 - 04:21.260:  missiles? Yes, this is what has been claimed by another account that we believe is linked to
04:21.260 - 04:30.260:  Wagner. And also I've seen a number of videos filmed by eyewitnesses who took out their phones
04:30.260 - 04:37.800:  and started filming this plane, tumbling out of the sky, spinning out to control, and some of
04:37.800 - 04:44.420:  them said they had heard two explosions and they jumped to the conclusion that this aircraft had
04:44.420 - 04:53.620:  been shot out of the sky. This, however, is entirely unconfirmed and speculative. But of course,
04:53.620 - 05:03.620:  given what Pregogin did back in June when he mounted his brief and unsuccessful mutiny against
05:03.620 - 05:10.920:  Russia's top military commanders, of course, a lot of people believed that he was a dead man
05:10.920 - 05:16.960:  walking and what he did was completely unforgivable in the eyes of the Kremlin. So he lived on
05:16.960 - 05:23.940:  borrowed time in the eyes of those people. So there's rife speculation about how Vladimir Putin may
05:23.940 - 05:30.000:  have exacted vengeance. But again, that's all unconfirmed at the moment. Yeah, because Pregogin
05:30.000 - 05:34.900:  primarily criticized the military leaders in Sergei Shoggi, the defense secretary, how will
05:34.900 - 05:44.780:  Vladimir Putin be feeling? Well, after that mutiny, it's clear that Vladimir Putin's authority
05:45.340 - 05:52.180:  has suffered. When his top military commanders were challenged that way, of course, he needed to
05:52.180 - 05:57.840:  take action. So a lot of people are saying now that Vladimir Putin may have taken action now.
05:58.200 - 06:04.320:  Vitaly Shevchenko. So how did the FGNP-Pregogin rise to such influence in Russia and to lead
06:04.320 - 06:09.940:  a mercenary group with a presence in many countries? Our analysis editor, Roz Afkins, has more
06:09.940 - 06:16.480:  on his story. The FGNP-Pregogin took an unorthodox route to a powerful position in Russia.
06:17.160 - 06:22.660:  In 1981, he was sent to prison for robbery and theft. And when released in 1990, he became a
06:22.740 - 06:28.840:  hot dog salesman in St Petersburg. But by 1997, he was running a top restaurant and winning
06:28.840 - 06:35.000:  lucrative catering contracts. Those brought connections to the top. Pregogin even served food
06:35.000 - 06:41.940:  to world leaders and to Putin himself. And Pregogin's role was becoming about much more than food.
06:41.940 - 06:48.700:  In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and launched an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Pregogin was involved.
06:48.700 - 06:54.720:  Of that time, he said a group of patriots was born, which later acquired the name Vagna Battalion.
06:55.440 - 07:01.380:  And soon, the Vagna Group reached far beyond Ukraine. The FBI accused Pregogin of interfering in
07:01.380 - 07:07.840:  the 2016 U.S. election. In Syria, Vagna fighters supported pro-government forces. More recently,
07:07.840 - 07:12.920:  there are multiple reports of Vagna's military and commercial activity in Africa,
07:13.560 - 07:18.860:  with the EU accusing the group of committing torture and extrajudicial summary or arbitrary
07:18.860 - 07:25.440:  executions and killings. And then came the war. When Putin wanted to give his invasion of Ukraine
07:25.440 - 07:31.320:  impetus, Pregogin and his fighters were called in. But as Vagna's death toll grew,
07:31.340 - 07:38.400:  so did Pregogin's fury, expressed first in video rants and then in a short-lived mutiny.
07:39.120 - 07:44.680:  In the aftermath, Putin condemned the mutineers and traitors. But for Pregogin, charges were dropped,
07:44.680 - 07:51.820:  no arrest followed, and we asked why wasn't Putin punishing Pregogin? Perhaps he was biting his time.
07:52.480 - 07:56.520:  Roz Afkins. In Moscow, this is how people on the street reacted.
07:58.520 - 08:01.920:  It's a tragedy that the plane crashed. That means there were casualties.
08:05.160 - 08:10.260:  Well, it was to be expected because some of the things Pregogin did or didn't do. I don't know,
08:10.260 - 08:15.480:  but we think he did. They should be punished. Not necessarily by the main man in this country
08:15.480 - 08:22.060:  could be someone else. He had a lot of enemies as far as I know. We worried about everyone,
08:22.060 - 08:28.620:  our hearts ache for everyone in the world. From there, our reporter Will Vernon has this analysis.
08:29.620 - 08:35.840:  I don't think this news has surprised anyone here today. Around an hour after that plane crash,
08:35.840 - 08:40.780:  the Russian Federal Aviation Authority, Rosaviy Atsya, released a statement confirming
08:40.780 - 08:47.180:  that you've got Pregogin's name on the passenger manifest of that plane. That is very fast
08:47.180 - 08:53.700:  for that particular agency. Rosaviy Atsya usually takes much longer to respond to incidents
08:53.700 - 09:01.200:  like this. That already raised a few eyebrows here. After all, speculation has been swirling
09:01.200 - 09:09.040:  for some time now. Just exactly about what fate would await Yevgeny Pregogin. When Yevgeny Pregogin
09:09.040 - 09:15.040:  launched his mutiny exactly two months ago, his Wagner mercenaries seized a major Russian city
09:15.520 - 09:21.980:  and even marched on Moscow. That was a major humiliation for the Kremlin, and Vladimir Putin is not
09:21.980 - 09:27.860:  the kind of man to forget that. So I think if Yevgeny Pregogin was killed in that plane crash
09:27.860 - 09:33.260:  today, which seems likely, I think that will come as no shock whatsoever to most people here.
09:33.420 - 09:37.380:  In fact, I think most people will probably be surprised that it didn't happen sooner.
09:38.120 - 09:43.520:  Now, we don't know what exactly caused that crash. Russian media are saying that investigators
09:43.560 - 09:49.080:  are looking into a number of different possibilities, including what they're calling external actions.
09:49.780 - 09:55.520:  Will Vernon in Moscow? In the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, people said they were not surprised by the
09:55.520 - 09:58.860:  reports and that they would not mourn Yevgeny Pregogin's death.
10:01.820 - 10:08.220:  This news brings only happiness. I want more news like this. It would make things much easier for
10:08.220 - 10:18.260:  Ukraine. I believe he staged his death in order to flee, so that no one knows where he's hiding.
10:21.040 - 10:26.640:  I don't think it'll change anything at the front line, but it will probably live spirit,
10:27.460 - 10:32.940:  though it's nice to know that there's one less plane out there and ten less Russians.
10:33.960 - 10:38.860:  Are Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse told us more about the reaction there so far?
10:39.900 - 10:44.360:  In the absence of a complete military victory for Ukraine, which has long been in the balance,
10:44.480 - 10:49.800:  a collapse of the Russian regime has been seen as another hopeful way out of this full-scale invasion.
10:50.540 - 10:55.680:  During Yevgeny Pregogin's failed arm mutiny in June, several Ukrainian soldiers posted videos
10:55.680 - 11:00.620:  of them watching with bags of popcorn. The only official reaction this time has come from
11:00.620 - 11:05.920:  senior presidential advisor, Mihailiy Podoliak, who's described the reported plane crash as a warning
11:05.920 - 11:11.740:  to Russia's elites ahead of the elections next year. Beware, disloyalty equals death,
11:11.740 - 11:16.240:  were the words he used. While many in Kiev have described the last two months as political
11:16.240 - 11:21.300:  turbulence in Russia as the beginning of the end for Vladimir Putin, events across the border
11:21.620 - 11:26.420:  be stabilizing as they've been, have done little to stem the relentless attrition seen on
11:26.420 - 11:32.260:  the vast front lines in Ukraine. James Waterhouse, and that is what we know for now about the
11:32.580 - 11:36.640:  situation involving that plane crash involving Yevgeny Pregogin.
11:37.700 - 11:42.540:  Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and former Trump lawyer on Wednesday,
11:42.540 - 11:47.140:  handed himself in to a county jail in Georgia. He's facing several indictments,
11:47.140 - 11:52.240:  accusing him of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.
11:52.780 - 11:57.820:  I spoke to our correspondent in the state capital, Atlanta, Barbara Petashia, who told me more
11:57.820 - 12:02.460:  about the man who at one stage was one of Mr. Trump's right-hand men.
12:03.120 - 12:09.540:  The former federal prosecutor, a former mayor, Mr. Trump's right-hand man, a personal lawyer while
12:09.540 - 12:17.280:  he was president. And now he has been booked on criminal charges. He has to settle to pay a bond
12:17.280 - 12:22.020:  payment with the court, $150,000. Almost as much as Donald Trump is going to have to pay,
12:22.020 - 12:27.780:  which is $200,000. And he is facing the same number of charges as Mr. Trump, 13, all of which
12:27.780 - 12:35.020:  reflects his significant position in Trump's inner circle. And also the way that he was very much
12:35.020 - 12:40.220:  in the forefront of advancing claims that the election had been stolen from Mr. Trump in Georgia.
12:40.220 - 12:46.300:  He was very active. He spoke to state lawmakers three times in December, promoting these falsehoods
12:46.300 - 12:50.840:  that there had been election fraud in Georgia. And perhaps the biggest come doubt, well, I shouldn't
12:50.840 - 12:55.920:  say the biggest come down. A part of it is that he has been charged under the racketeering law that
12:55.920 - 13:01.820:  alleges all 19 defendants participated in a conspiracy to overturn the election. And he had at
13:01.820 - 13:07.540:  one point in his life made a name for himself with racketeering cases. And now he faces those charges
13:07.540 - 13:14.980:  himself. So that's Mr. Giuliani. But what will happen with Mr. Trump tomorrow? He's going to be booked
13:14.980 - 13:20.080:  for a fourth time. This is the fourth criminal case against him. So he'll be fingerprinted. We're
13:20.080 - 13:24.860:  expecting to probably have his mug shot taken. As Sarah was saying, all the other defendants have
13:24.860 - 13:30.300:  so far. And that would be the first time that it would happen with him. He has to pay this $200,000
13:30.300 - 13:35.760:  bond, but it has particular conditions attached to it for him. They prohibit him from intimidating
13:36.320 - 13:40.540:  anyone, co-defendants, witnesses, or victims in the case, including on social media.
13:41.260 - 13:45.840:  We are, I mean, the other three times he surrendered himself, he's turned it into a bit of
13:45.840 - 13:50.160:  spectacle sort of presenting himself as the victim of a political witch hunt. I think it would be
13:50.160 - 13:55.780:  safe to say he may try to do the same again on Thursday. He's already posted that he would proudly
13:55.780 - 14:02.560:  be arrested on Thursday afternoon. And then this time his arrangement is separate. Usually they
14:02.560 - 14:06.960:  have been taken place together, but this time that's had to happen in early September in Georgia.
14:06.960 - 14:11.840:  And also it might be televised because Georgia law allows it. And none of the others have been,
14:11.840 - 14:19.360:  so that would be another first. Barbara Plett Usher. Still to come in this podcast.
14:20.380 - 14:26.240:  On our page, it would have said universal music, who would book the ad, but there's very little
14:26.240 - 14:32.660:  chance it was actually noticing it. Why fans think the rolling stones are rolling back the years
14:32.660 - 14:35.800:  by announcing their new album in a newspaper ad.
14:43.220 - 14:48.300:  In the US state of Wisconsin, it's the man who isn't actually there who looks
14:48.300 - 14:53.580:  set to dominate the first TV debate in the race to become the Republican Party's presidential
14:53.580 - 14:59.360:  nominee. Donald Trump has chosen not to appear on stage in Milwaukee. Eight other candidates
14:59.360 - 15:04.740:  will be there, including the Florida governor, Rhonda Santis and the former vice president, Mike
15:04.740 - 15:10.660:  Pence. They will all end up having to answer questions about Mr. Trump's legal troubles before he
15:10.660 - 15:16.280:  then steal the headlines when he turns up to be arrested in Atlanta, Georgia on Thursday.
15:16.760 - 15:20.660:  The BBC's North America editor Sarah Smith reports from Milwaukee.
15:29.480 - 15:32.880:  No problem. It's still going to be an exciting debate.
15:32.880 - 15:37.420:  On the airwaves in Milwaukee, it's Donald Trump's absence from tonight's debate. That's the
15:37.420 - 15:43.300:  talk of the time. Radio host and self-confessed Trump fan, Donald Donald, says he understands the
15:43.300 - 15:48.340:  president's reasoning. Why should he have to bother with small little things like debating
15:48.340 - 15:55.320:  candidates who are at 5% against him? So it's arrogant? A little bit. A little bit. I mean,
15:55.320 - 16:01.340:  every other candidate is showing up to tell the American people what their plans are for the
16:01.340 - 16:07.180:  presidency. And Trump has literally said, well, I served four years as president. You know what my
16:07.180 - 16:12.640:  policies are. My policies are great. Why should I have to explain them to you? That does sound
16:12.640 - 16:17.360:  kind of arrogant when it's put that way, doesn't it? The truth is, Donald Trump is so far ahead in
16:17.360 - 16:23.960:  polls. He can risk snubbing Wisconsin voters, even in a key swing state. Why is Donald Trump so far
16:23.960 - 16:27.640:  ahead in the polls at the moment? Because of how he let our country for four years.
16:28.120 - 16:32.460:  Are you disappointed Trump's not taking part? Yes, I am in a way, but again, he's on stage.
16:32.460 - 16:38.100:  It's all going to be about him. I think he's coward. I think he can show up and defend himself
16:38.140 - 16:43.380:  in front of a live audience. Trump did consider debates essential when he was running against
16:43.380 - 16:50.720:  Joe Biden three years ago. He's too cowardly to even show up and debate. Now I understand he's
16:50.720 - 16:54.040:  canceling the debates. Let's see what happens. I think that's not going to be a good move.
16:54.080 - 16:56.860:  I hear he's afraid to debate. You want the debates so do I.
16:56.940 - 17:02.120:  The debate venue is decorated with huge Fox News branding. Donald Trump's war with the conservative
17:02.120 - 17:07.120:  network over what he sees as unfavorable coverage is a big part of his decision to stay away.
17:07.600 - 17:12.500:  Yet he'll still dominate the stage, as the other eight candidates will inevitably be asked about
17:12.500 - 17:18.100:  all the indictments against him. He's scared he is just a couple of steps away from that jail cell
17:18.100 - 17:23.300:  closing behind him. Like Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who's running specifically
17:23.300 - 17:28.820:  to try to knock out Donald Trump, but he can't land a blow on an opponent who's absent.
17:28.860 - 17:35.180:  Everybody should debate. Everybody has a responsibility to earn people's votes.
17:35.720 - 17:39.680:  Florida Governor Ronda Santas is currently running a poor second to Donald Trump.
17:39.680 - 17:43.880:  He needs to turn in a stellar performance to turn around an ailing campaign.
17:43.900 - 17:50.320:  He's attacking Trump for not turning up. Nobody is entitled to anything in this world.
17:50.320 - 17:56.160:  Less of all the Republican nomination for president. Also on stage will be former vice president
17:56.160 - 18:01.700:  Mike Pence, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley,
18:01.760 - 18:06.080:  the North Dakota governor Doug Burgham, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson,
18:06.080 - 18:11.740:  and biotech millionaire Vivek Ramishwamy, who performed a cringe worthy M&M
18:11.740 - 18:20.020:  rap at the Iowa State Fair, but is still enjoying a small surge in opinion polls.
18:20.500 - 18:25.500:  Yet, however, any of them perform tonight. Donald Trump is sure to upstage the debate by
18:25.500 - 18:30.200:  surrendering himself to a jailhouse in Georgia tomorrow to be formally booked on charges
18:30.200 - 18:34.860:  of election interference. This time there will be a mugshot taken, and once again,
18:34.860 - 18:39.320:  Donald Trump will have sucked all of the oxygen out of this race, leaving his opponents
18:39.320 - 18:48.720:  gasping. Sarah Smith in Milwaukee. Now to the latest chapter in the story of Andrew Tate,
18:48.720 - 18:54.840:  the former kickboxer, who became world famous as an online misogynist or a hypermasculine
18:54.840 - 18:59.960:  influencer, depending on who you ask. He's currently facing trial in Romania for human
18:59.960 - 19:05.040:  trafficking and forming an organized criminal group with his brother and two other defendants.
19:05.360 - 19:10.540:  Andrew Tate is also facing a charge of rape. The group deny all the charges against them.
19:10.700 - 19:15.480:  Now the BBC has seen details of graphic evidence compiled by Romanian prosecutors,
19:16.080 - 19:21.720:  alleging that Andrew Tate coerced women into sexual acts and discussed treating them as slaves.
19:22.260 - 19:25.240:  Our correspondent Lucy Williamson is following the story.
19:26.180 - 19:31.640:  Over hundreds of pages, Romanian prosecutors outline the testimony and the evidence they say
19:31.640 - 19:36.740:  they've gathered against Andrew Tate. It includes transcriptions of what the prosecution says,
19:36.740 - 19:42.860:  a text and audio messages which appear to show how the alleged trafficking operation was managed,
19:43.560 - 19:48.900:  and the apparent coercion, control and abuse of women by Mr Tate and his co-defendants.
19:49.500 - 19:55.520:  In one transcribed exchange, Andrew Tate appears to coerce an alleged victim into group sex
19:55.520 - 20:02.040:  using abusive language. His brother Tristan is also quoted in prosecution transcripts,
20:02.220 - 20:09.840:  allegedly talking about slaving women for 10 to 12 hours a day. The BBC can't verify whether
20:09.840 - 20:16.280:  these transcripts are accurate because the original evidence is not included in the 300-page
20:16.280 - 20:21.840:  summary that we've seen. In that summary, the prosecution also says that women were forced by
20:21.840 - 20:27.980:  the defendants to make pornographic content online and alleges that some women did not control
20:27.980 - 20:33.300:  the money they made and were fined for crying on camera or for not working hard enough.
20:34.080 - 20:39.140:  A spokeswoman for the Tate brothers said that they vehemently denied the serious allegations
20:39.140 - 20:45.260:  against them and accused the BBC of lacking impartiality, but she didn't provide any detail or
20:45.260 - 20:51.160:  respond to the specific allegations we raised. Defence lawyers are expected to challenge the
20:51.160 - 20:56.120:  prosecution evidence in a pre-trial hearing later this month. Lucy Williamson.
20:56.820 - 21:01.660:  Here in Britain, two teenagers have been found responsible for hacking into the computer systems
21:01.660 - 21:06.640:  of a series of major companies. They were key players in a hacking group that launched cyber
21:06.640 - 21:12.060:  attacks against firms, including the telecoms giant BT and a computer chip manufacturer.
21:12.060 - 21:17.820:  Joe Inwood reports from the court in London. They were audacious attacks against some of the
21:17.820 - 21:24.460:  world's biggest tech firms, carried out by a pair of British teenagers. In 2021, 18-year-old
21:24.460 - 21:30.820:  Aryan Kotage, who is severely autistic and so deemed unfit to stand trial, tried to blackmail BT
21:30.820 - 21:36.560:  an EE for $4 million. Along with a 17-year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons,
21:36.560 - 21:42.360:  he then illegally access phone numbers to steal around £100,000 from online crypto wallets.
21:43.220 - 21:47.200:  Both were also found to have hacked and blackmailed the chip manufacturer in video
21:47.780 - 21:53.080:  before being arrested. Acting alone, Kotage then used his hotel TV and an Amazon
21:53.080 - 21:59.660:  firestick to target Uber, the online bank Revolut, and finally Grand Theft Automaker rockstar games,
21:59.660 - 22:05.640:  threatening to publish valuable code. The jury were asked to determine whether or not Kotage did
22:05.640 - 22:11.200:  the ax alleged, not if he did it with criminal intent. Both will be sentenced at a later date
22:11.200 - 22:18.240:  for acting the court heard as digital bandits. Joe Inwood. Two separate groups of researchers
22:18.240 - 22:23.000:  have developed technology designed to help people who are paralyzed and can't speak to communicate
22:23.000 - 22:28.380:  faster and more accurately. The findings have been jointly published in the journal Nature.
22:28.720 - 22:33.680:  Experts say this represents a big leap forward towards decoding what people without a voice
22:34.080 - 22:37.180:  want to say is our health reporter, Philippa Roxby.
22:38.040 - 22:43.420:  Researchers from Stanford University tested their technology on 68-year-old Pat Bennett,
22:43.420 - 22:48.980:  who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease 10 years ago. She now struggles to talk.
22:49.600 - 22:55.500:  Surgeons implanted four tiny sensors, the size of pills, into areas of her brain which are key
22:55.500 - 23:01.600:  to producing speech. They then trained an algorithm to decode her brain activity as she tries to
23:01.600 - 23:06.940:  form words. In a video, she's smiling and laughing with researchers as her thoughts are
23:06.940 - 23:13.560:  translated into sentences on a computer screen in close to real time. Dr. Frank Willett is one of
23:13.560 - 23:19.840:  the researchers. She can say any word of 125,000 so it's a large possible set of words. It's not
23:19.840 - 23:26.640:  just a limited vocabulary and the accuracy was about 23% word error rate. And obviously that's
23:26.640 - 23:31.720:  something we want to improve and move forward but it's such a big difference from what's been
23:31.720 - 23:37.460:  done in the past. In another study in Nature, researchers in San Francisco described trialing
23:37.460 - 23:43.380:  similar technology on a woman severely paralyzed after a stroke. They were able to convert her
23:43.380 - 23:50.100:  brain activity into words spoken by an avatar on a screen with facial expressions. And they used
23:50.100 - 24:00.300:  a speech she made in a wedding video to recreate her voice. The scientists behind the studies
24:00.300 - 24:05.500:  are excited by the progress they've made. Their brain computer interface produces words
24:05.500 - 24:11.440:  three times more quickly than previous ones. It's also more accurate than before, although there
24:11.440 - 24:17.540:  were still some errors in words. They caution it's still early days and lots of refining and
24:17.540 - 24:24.180:  improving of the technology is now needed. Currently, many people with M&D use their eyes to pick out
24:24.180 - 24:30.440:  words on a screen using recordings of their own voice. But that can be time consuming. By using
24:30.440 - 24:36.100:  brain signals, scientists hope to restore more rapid communication to those who can't speak.
24:39.160 - 24:44.400:  These days, any star who wants to make an announcement is obliged to use social media to get
24:44.400 - 24:49.980:  maximum exposure. But the Rolling Stones have gone back to basics by appearing to take out an
24:49.980 - 24:56.400:  advert in a local paper in East London to reveal what's thought to be the title of their new album
24:56.400 - 25:01.300:  Hackney Diamonds. Hard to believe, then, that back in 1965, when they released,
25:01.300 - 25:06.580:  I can't get no satisfaction, Mick Jagger thought they wouldn't be performing by the end of the
25:06.580 - 25:13.460:  60s, let alone in the 2020s, as he told Michael Parkinson at the time. We've been doing this now for
25:13.460 - 25:18.160:  how many years of it? Two years. How much longer do you give yourself doing this thing,
25:18.160 - 25:24.720:  going around being a solider? I don't know. I never thought we'd be doing it for two years even.
25:25.520 - 25:29.500:  When we started off, I never thought we'd make it very big anyway. And then when we have,
25:29.500 - 25:32.980:  we're making records for two years and everybody still goes around corners,
25:32.980 - 25:39.940:  quite a new group. And I don't know. I think we sort of pretty well set up for at least another year.
25:40.580 - 25:46.380:  Mick turned 80 last month, but he, Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, are still leading the
25:46.380 - 25:52.300:  greatest rock and roll band in the world. So what's the story with what could be their 31st
25:52.300 - 25:55.060:  studio album? Here's our music reporter, Mark Savage.
26:00.300 - 26:04.740:  It's almost two decades since the Rolling Stones released an album of new material,
26:05.320 - 26:10.800:  but now the wait might be over. Last week, an advert for a glass replacement service was
26:10.800 - 26:16.300:  published in the Hackney Gazette, but eagle-eyed fans spotted it was riddled with references to
26:16.300 - 26:22.640:  songs like Gimme Shelter and Satisfaction, and then almost imperceptibly, a copy of the band's
26:22.640 - 26:30.260:  famous lips logo. The record label wouldn't confirm it, but fans have deduced this is the
26:30.260 - 26:35.860:  announcement of a new album called Hackney Diamonds. Even the newspaper's editor, Simon Murphy,
26:36.300 - 26:41.060:  didn't know the advert was coming. The first I heard about it was for actually for our readers,
26:41.060 - 26:45.480:  rather than having any idea that it was going to be in the paper before it's published.
26:45.820 - 26:51.680:  On our page plan, it would have said universal music, who book the ad, but there's very little
26:51.680 - 26:56.460:  chance it was actually kind of noticing it, looking at it and kind of working out from the
26:56.700 - 27:04.240:  clues that it was actually for the Rolling Stones. We already know that the Stones started
27:04.240 - 27:09.740:  work on new material before the pandemic, and that includes the last ever recordings of drummer
27:09.740 - 27:15.900:  Charlie Watts, who died two years ago at the age of 80. Paul McCartney and Elton John are also
27:15.900 - 27:20.940:  rumored to have been involved in the sessions, and the band have said any new material will be
27:20.940 - 27:24.780:  dedicated to Watts Memory. Mark Savage.
27:27.680 - 27:32.660:  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast.
