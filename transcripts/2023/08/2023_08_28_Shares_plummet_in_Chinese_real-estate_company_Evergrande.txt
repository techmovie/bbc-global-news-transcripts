00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:17.740:  by advertising. I was working in a coffee shop in Boston to help pay rent while I was training
00:17.740 - 00:21.440:  for the trials and so people kept joking. They were like, oh yeah, she just took a two-hour coffee
00:21.440 - 00:27.420:  break and went and ran the Olympic trials bare at that. On the podium is back with more Olympians
00:27.420 - 00:32.820:  and Paralympians sharing their journeys to the top. On the podium from the BBC World Service,
00:32.820 - 00:39.940:  listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World
00:39.940 - 00:47.580:  Service. I'm Janet Julian, 13 hours GMT on Monday the 28th of August. These are our main stories.
00:48.320 - 00:53.740:  Shares and the hugely indebted Chinese property firm Evergrande have plummeted during their
00:53.740 - 01:00.800:  first-day trading in Hong Kong for 18 months. The billionaire founder of the electronics giant Foxconn
01:00.800 - 01:08.860:  is announcing he'll run for the presidency of Taiwan. Also in this podcast, the mother of the
01:08.860 - 01:14.540:  controversial Spanish football chief, Louise Rubiales, has locked herself in a church and gone on
01:14.540 - 01:20.880:  hunger strike in support of her son. It's just incredible because I don't feel alone anymore,
01:21.040 - 01:26.120:  I feel a power or something. Something that I felt like I was messing my whole life. I'm meeting
01:26.120 - 01:37.700:  exclusively for redheads. Evergrande is one of China's top property developers, a company so huge
01:37.700 - 01:44.420:  that it reaches the definition of too big to fail. Yet in recent years, it's emerged that it's more
01:44.420 - 01:52.360:  than $300 billion in debt and possibly at risk of collapse. Now, after trading its shares in Hong
01:52.360 - 01:58.360:  Kong for the first time in a year and a half, it's seen their value plummet by about 80%.
01:59.060 - 02:04.740:  And this latest blow to the property company comes as China's post-pandemic recovery is faltering.
02:05.240 - 02:10.260:  Our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Michael Bristo, told us more about the significance of this
02:10.540 - 02:16.440:  dismal share performance. This is the first time for a year and a half since Evergrande's
02:16.440 - 02:22.400:  problems, financial problems, first emerged that shareholders, investors have been allowed to trade
02:22.540 - 02:28.540:  stock in Evergrande and they've essentially given their verdict on their faith in the company and
02:28.540 - 02:33.580:  how they see it going. And obviously, they've sold companies stock so they don't have much
02:33.580 - 02:40.420:  making that company hence the plummeting share price. So essentially what it is, it's an indication
02:40.420 - 02:46.260:  of the state of the company. The company itself, before share trading began, issued a statement
02:46.260 - 02:52.660:  to the stock exchange, which it admitted itself that it could go bust in the coming months. So
02:53.500 - 02:58.980:  essentially, it's big problems not just for this company, but also for the real estate sector
02:59.280 - 03:03.340:  in China more widely. And the economy, as you indicated there,
03:04.040 - 03:09.840:  economies in the doldrums at the moment, it has recovered somewhat after coronavirus restrictions
03:09.840 - 03:15.540:  were lifted, but not quite as much as hoped. And really, the troubles facing Evergrande are a
03:15.540 - 03:21.340:  symptom of troubles in the wider economy as a whole. And Evergrande has delayed votes by foreign
03:21.340 - 03:27.000:  investors on whether to accept a restructuring plan just hours before that was due to take place.
03:27.000 - 03:32.800:  What should we make of that? Yeah, this was another event today and another indication of just
03:32.800 - 03:40.120:  how precarious Evergrande's position is at the moment. It was due to hold votes by
03:40.120 - 03:46.420:  at meetings for foreign investors to essentially get them to accept restructuring plan.
03:46.420 - 03:52.560:  Evergrande wanted them to accept that it would defer paying them back many years into the future.
03:52.560 - 03:57.420:  Well, those votes have now been delayed. And you can only assume that they've been delayed
03:58.120 - 04:04.080:  because Evergrande just didn't believe it had enough votes to get the schemes that it had
04:04.080 - 04:09.260:  in place approved. Presumably, it would have wanted those approved as soon as possible,
04:09.260 - 04:15.120:  so it could get back on the right track. So it could present itself as having investor confidence.
04:15.120 - 04:20.540:  So this is again, another indication that really the company's in dire straits.
04:21.620 - 04:26.760:  Michael Bristow. The billionaire founder of the electronics giant Foxconn Terry Goh has
04:26.760 - 04:31.700:  announced that he'll run for the presidency of Taiwan. Mr Goh will stand as an independent
04:31.700 - 04:36.440:  in January's election after failing to become the candidate for the main opposition party.
04:37.080 - 04:41.600:  He said his company's huge investments in China gave him the knowledge and relationships
04:41.600 - 04:48.060:  to keep Taiwan safe from a Chinese attack. Beijing considers the island part of its own territory
04:48.060 - 04:53.400:  and has threatened to take it by force. But critics say Mr Goh's business interests make him
04:53.400 - 04:57.640:  vulnerable to pressure from Beijing, something he denies.
04:59.740 - 05:05.060:  If the Chinese Communist leadership says, if you don't listen to me, I will seize the assets of Foxconn.
05:05.120 - 05:13.000:  I would say yes, please do it. I am willing to sacrifice my personal assets for them not to attack Taiwan.
05:15.140 - 05:17.660:  Zhao De Silva from our business desk has the details.
05:18.200 - 05:25.680:  Mr Goh is a hugely popular businessman in Taiwan. He founded a company that is one of the world's
05:25.680 - 05:31.420:  largest contract producers of electronics. It's a major supplier for Apple's iPhones.
05:31.500 - 05:37.640:  And more importantly here, it has a long history in mainland China going back decades. It was one
05:37.640 - 05:43.520:  of the first Taiwanese companies to invest there at the time to take advantage of the cheaper
05:43.520 - 05:49.840:  labor costs there. Now, today, Foxconn has a huge network of factories and business interest in
05:49.840 - 05:56.600:  the mainland, meaning its founder, Mr Goh, is very, very well connected there. And that given the long
05:56.600 - 06:02.640:  standing geopolitical issue between Taiwan and mainland China, it could make him controversial,
06:02.640 - 06:09.900:  at least with a substantial part of Taiwan's electorate. Now, this decision to run for president
06:09.900 - 06:16.300:  is not entirely unexpected. A few years ago, Mr Goh stepped down as Foxconn's boss to make
06:16.300 - 06:23.200:  a bid for the presidency, but he failed to be nominated. So this is one more attempt from Mr Goh.
06:23.200 - 06:27.980:  This time around, he's running as an independence. But he's a former member of the Kwameing
06:27.980 - 06:34.260:  Tang, which of course has closer ties with China than the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
06:34.260 - 06:40.860:  or DPP has criticized the DPP and the leadership of President Tsai Ing-wen for worsening tensions
06:40.940 - 06:45.020:  with China. And he has called for direct talks with Beijing.
06:45.960 - 06:50.880:  So out of silver, five days on from presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe,
06:50.880 - 06:56.700:  the country's main opposition leader is continuing to cry foul. Nelson Chameza, who heads the
06:56.700 - 07:03.260:  Citizens Coalition for Change, or CCC, has accused the president, Emerson Emnan-Gagwa of carrying
07:03.260 - 07:09.660:  out a coup. He says it is his party, which in fact won the election. Despite the opposition's claims,
07:09.660 - 07:15.680:  Zimbabwe's constitutional court has upheld the vote, but international observers have also
07:15.680 - 07:21.580:  expressed concerns about what some have called a climate affair. Senator David Kultart is one of
07:21.580 - 07:26.500:  the leading opposition politicians in Zimbabwe's Citizens Coalition for Change. He's
07:26.500 - 07:31.480:  spoke to my colleague, Sarni Safi. Well, generally in the run-up to the election, it was one of the
07:31.480 - 07:38.020:  most illegal elections I've ever experienced in the 40 years I've been back in Zimbabwe. They
07:38.020 - 07:44.400:  manipulated the votes for all the police were used to shut down rallies. On election day,
07:44.400 - 07:50.660:  itself, in areas that traditionally support opposition, mainly the capital, the second city
07:51.100 - 07:59.220:  where ballots didn't get delivered in some cases until 13 hours after polls were opened.
07:59.940 - 08:07.300:  There were Zonu-Pf desks throughout the country to the law threatening people to vote for
08:07.300 - 08:15.380:  for Zonu-Pf. And now, finally, in the announcement of the result given to Mr. Emnan-Gagwa,
08:15.960 - 08:23.920:  is at complete variance with what independent observers have said should be the amount
08:23.920 - 08:30.840:  that Mr. Emnan-Gagwa got. So, this is rigging on a grand scale.
08:31.980 - 08:36.600:  So, what will you were a party be doing? What's likely to happen?
08:37.200 - 08:42.040:  Well, we've documented all the illegalities, the breaches of the Constitution and the
08:42.040 - 08:50.140:  electoral law. We are gratified by the SATAC Observer Mission Report, which confirms that the
08:50.140 - 08:56.500:  election was illegal, even the African Union Observer Mission Report confirms that it's not as
08:56.500 - 09:05.420:  strong as the SATAC report. What we focused on at present is the final compilation of all the
09:05.800 - 09:11.620:  voting statistics and figures so that we can demonstrate to the international community
09:12.200 - 09:16.360:  that the final result announced by the Electoral Commission is in fact wrong.
09:17.240 - 09:22.820:  So, by the sound of it, this will take time. And if this dispute is not solved in time,
09:23.540 - 09:26.460:  what do you think this means for the citizens of Zimbabwe?
09:27.420 - 09:34.260:  Well, the tragedy about this is that we've had five years of chaos under Emnan-Gagwa. We've
09:34.260 - 09:41.560:  seen a return to hyperinflation. We've seen endemic corruption, we've seen the passage of Draconian
09:41.560 - 09:47.780:  a new legislation, the so-called Patriot Bill, which potentially would even make a conversation
09:47.900 - 09:54.240:  like this criminal. And that's what we now face for the next five years, further economic collapse,
09:55.320 - 10:00.240:  a further drifting of the country, a further exodus of our most talented people,
10:00.840 - 10:07.700:  for the collapse of our health and education sector. So, it's a disastrous prospect and we hope
10:08.100 - 10:13.560:  that the international community, particularly our neighbours, will stand firm and say that they
10:13.560 - 10:19.900:  do not accept this result. That was Senator David Coltart, who's also just been voted in as Mayor
10:19.900 - 10:26.560:  for the city of Bulaweo. Libya has suspended its foreign minister because she met her Israeli
10:26.560 - 10:32.260:  counterpart last week, despite the two countries not having formal relations. The talks prompted
10:32.260 - 10:38.080:  small protests in Tripoli and other Libyan cities. From Jerusalem, here's our Middle East correspondent,
10:38.080 - 10:43.420:  Tom Bateman. Israel announced with some fanfare what it said was a historic meeting in Rome
10:43.420 - 10:48.360:  between its foreign minister, Ellie Cohen and his Libyan counterpart, Najelab Al-Mangouj.
10:48.780 - 10:53.860:  Suggesting this was a first step in establishing diplomatic relations after Israel's deals with
10:53.860 - 10:58.860:  other Arab countries. But within hours, Libya's Prime Minister, said Ms Al-Mangouj, was being
10:58.860 - 11:05.020:  suspended as foreign minister, calling the meeting a chance encounter. As some small protests
11:05.020 - 11:10.480:  broke out in Tripoli, Libya's foreign ministry declared its complete and absolute rejection
11:10.480 - 11:16.080:  of normalization, with what it called designist entity, saying it was committed to the Palestinian
11:16.080 - 11:21.420:  cause. Tom Bateman. Well, this comes as a violence between Palestinians and Israelis in
11:21.420 - 11:27.300:  occupied West Bank has escalated to its highest level for years, with near-nightly Israeli
11:27.300 - 11:33.220:  military raids and a series of Palestinian militant attacks. There's also been a record rise
11:33.220 - 11:39.120:  in settler violence. The UN says it's now seeing an average of three settler attacks a day,
11:39.500 - 11:44.340:  as at least three Palestinian communities have been forced from their land in recent months.
11:45.040 - 11:49.060:  Half a million Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, not including East Jerusalem,
11:49.060 - 11:55.000:  and the current far-right government has set a goal of doubling that to one million.
11:55.660 - 11:58.240:  Our Middle East correspondent Yolanda Nell reports.
12:01.560 - 12:07.100:  Smashed cars and homes and shops ablaze. This year has seen some of the worst ever-act
12:07.100 - 12:13.420:  surveillance by extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank. Many have guns and some encounters
12:13.420 - 12:22.120:  with Palestinians have turned deadly. This little roundabout in Burka has become a monument to
12:22.840 - 12:29.220:  Qasai Muaytan who was killed earlier this month, not very far away. There are pictures of him
12:29.220 - 12:36.840:  everywhere. He's just 19 years old. No one is listening to us. No one's doing anything about the
12:36.840 - 12:43.440:  illegal settlers do on a daily basis. I meet a relative of Qasai. She says he was fatally
12:43.440 - 12:48.760:  shot after locals rushed to protect their farmland from settlers. In an unusually strong
12:48.760 - 12:55.380:  rebuke, the US called what happened in Burka Jewish terrorism. Qasai's relative is afraid to be
12:55.380 - 13:00.940:  named. No one knows who the next Qasai is going to be. No one is going to protect us.
13:00.940 - 13:07.580:  Our government can't legally do anything. While the Palestinian Authority governs in big cities
13:07.580 - 13:14.300:  like nearby Ramallah, Israel retains full control over 60 percent of the West Bank and its soldiers
13:14.300 - 13:19.820:  here protect hundreds of thousands of settlers. They've been criticized for how they've dealt with
13:19.820 - 13:27.420:  much of the recent violence. Up here on the hillside, among the olive trees you've got these prefabricated
13:27.420 - 13:32.960:  buildings. This is where the Jewish settlers live in Ossetion. It's built on officially registered
13:32.960 - 13:39.080:  privately owned Palestinian land belonging to people down in Burka. And you can see that Palestinian
13:39.080 - 13:43.740:  village, the white buildings in the valley below us. And you can imagine how with Palestinians and
13:43.740 - 13:49.700:  settlers living so close together there is a constant possibility of confrontation, of friction
13:49.700 - 13:56.780:  and violence. Our vision is that all the land of Israel will be settled with Jews. It's our
13:56.780 - 14:03.240:  basic right. Settler Yudh Aliba moved here with his young family. He tells me the Bible is his
14:03.240 - 14:08.180:  deed to this hilltop. And he's encouraged that there are cabinet ministers and Israel's most
14:08.180 - 14:16.100:  nationalist far-right government to date who share his ideology. We have an expectation from a
14:16.100 - 14:20.620:  right-wing elected government to settle the land, expand and not hurt the settlements.
14:20.620 - 14:27.640:  Most of the world sees all of the settlements as illegal, but Israel's government rejects that.
14:28.040 - 14:34.260:  It's now approving settlement construction at record speed and retroactively authorizing outposts.
14:34.540 - 14:38.940:  This is all in the West Bank, which the Palestinians want for a state of their own.
14:39.460 - 14:43.740:  The head of the UN's agency for humanitarian services here and today at the Dominican
14:43.740 - 14:49.940:  is worried by the trends. We're seeing the more and more pressure on Palestinian communities to
14:49.940 - 14:54.820:  leave their land. So there are three communities that have been completely removed or they have
14:54.820 - 15:00.060:  left their land. A lot of tensions. And the worst case scenario is of course those attacks where you
15:00.060 - 15:07.460:  have literally settlers going down to villages attacking people. Without grazing land for their sheep,
15:07.460 - 15:13.880:  Palestinian herders worry for their future. This month, nearly 90 people fled from the grassy
15:13.880 - 15:19.520:  slopes of Al-Kaboon where they'd lived for generations. Shepard Amar Abu Aliah blames
15:19.520 - 15:26.100:  settler harassment. They used to stop outside our house at midnight and hold their car horns
15:26.100 - 15:32.100:  or send kids to harass us. They would scare the sheep and block them in or empty out our water tank.
15:35.560 - 15:40.420:  Settlers are emboldened by the new political reality in Israel and there's a growing sense
15:40.420 - 15:46.820:  of impunity. It all adds to Palestinian anger and resentment. As the Israeli government seeks to
15:46.820 - 15:52.160:  use huge new investment and settlements to cement the Jewish presence in the West Bank to change
15:52.160 - 15:58.020:  the landscape, the bitter decades old conflict with the Palestinians looks set to deepen.
15:59.160 - 16:01.120:  That report by Yoland Nell.
16:04.040 - 16:08.440:  Still to come on the podcast, France announces that it's banning school girls from wearing
16:08.440 - 16:12.520:  abayers and loose-fitting, full-length robes usually worn by Muslims.
16:15.320 - 16:21.060:  France schoolers built around extremely strong values and principles, notably secularism.
16:28.120 - 16:32.720:  From their battles on the world stage, I gave everything for that race and I was able to come away
16:33.000 - 16:37.220:  with something that I've dreamed about since I was a kid. To their battles behind closed doors.
16:37.220 - 16:43.280:  I had to reach some terrible bottoms in my addiction and suffer some really terrible consequences
16:43.400 - 16:47.540:  and suffer a lot of loss due to my drinking to get to where I am today.
16:48.700 - 16:53.300:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympians and Paralympians share their stories.

17:00.720 - 17:05.960:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. There's been another unexpected twist in a scandal
17:05.960 - 17:11.120:  engulfing Spanish football. The mother of Louise Rubiales, the president of Spain's Football
17:11.120 - 17:16.220:  Federation, has locked herself in a church and is staging a hunger strike in protest
17:16.220 - 17:20.200:  of what she's calling the inhumane witch hunt against her son.
17:27.840 - 17:33.500:  She's saying that she and her son want to be left in peace and asks that Jenny tells the truth.
17:34.100 - 17:39.480:  She's referring there to the Spanish star player, Jenny Emoso. Mr. Rubiales has been under
17:39.480 - 17:44.980:  intense pressure to resign after causing an outcry by kissing Ms. Hermoso on the lips
17:44.980 - 17:50.040:  following her team's victory in the World Cup. He's been suspended by football's world-governing
17:50.040 - 17:55.000:  body FIFA, despite being backed by the Spanish Football Federation, which at one point was threatening
17:55.000 - 18:01.600:  to take legal action against Ms. Hermoso. Our reporter, Imadrid Guy, Hedgeco, told us more about
18:01.600 - 18:07.520:  this rather unusual protest by Mr. Rubiales' mother. Well, his mother, Ankelis Bechard,
18:07.520 - 18:14.020:  has locked herself in a church and in the southern city of Montreal with her sister. And as you
18:14.020 - 18:20.800:  said, she says that she wants to see an end to what she calls the inhumane witch hunt of her son,
18:21.260 - 18:26.460:  the pressure that has been on him throughout the last week because of that kiss he gave Jenny
18:26.460 - 18:32.920:  Emoso. His mother has said that the kiss was consensual and that there was no kind of sexual
18:32.920 - 18:39.300:  abuse involved and that all the pressure that has been heaped on him is unjustified. So she's
18:39.300 - 18:44.380:  really sort of making the same kind of arguments that Mr. Rubiales himself has been making.
18:44.860 - 18:49.100:  Meanwhile, there's another emergency meeting of the Spanish Football Association during a couple
18:49.100 - 18:56.060:  of hours' time. Yes, that's right. That will be a meeting which will take place without Mr. Rubiales
18:56.060 - 19:01.820:  because he's been suspended by the world governing body FIFA. And we're expecting that meeting
19:01.820 - 19:09.860:  to tell us whether the Football Association is going to distance itself from Mr. Rubiales because
19:10.380 - 19:16.080:  over the last week it has really supported him to the hilt on this issue. It has said that
19:16.320 - 19:25.260:  that infamous kiss was consensual and that there was no wrongdoing at all on the part of Mr. Rubiales.
19:25.460 - 19:29.280:  There is a feeling that because of all the pressure there's been heaped upon him over the last
19:29.280 - 19:35.240:  week that it may change its tack on that issue and we may start to see the federation distance
19:35.240 - 19:40.860:  itself from him. It should point out there's also a meeting by the National Sports Tribunal
19:40.860 - 19:48.000:  which the government has asked to open proceedings against Mr. Rubiales and that could potentially
19:48.000 - 19:54.860:  lead to his removal from office. So there are a couple of important meetings today here in
19:54.860 - 19:59.240:  Madrid which could have some pretty important consequences regarding this issue.
20:00.180 - 20:06.480:  Guy Hedgeko. In its latest move to defend its secular traditions, France is to ban school pupils
20:06.480 - 20:12.220:  from wearing abayers, loose-fitting full-length robes that are worn by some Muslim women and girls.
20:12.220 - 20:17.820:  The Education Minister Gabriel Attal said the rule would come into force as soon as a new
20:17.820 - 20:22.340:  school year starts at the beginning of September. He was speaking to the French television station
20:22.780 - 20:34.860:  The school of the Republic is built around values and principles, notably secularism.
20:35.600 - 20:40.500:  This is not a constraint, it's a freedom. It's the freedom to develop one's opinions and
20:40.500 - 20:47.660:  to free oneself through school. For me, secularism in schools is very clear. You go into a classroom
20:48.360 - 20:52.720:  and you shouldn't be able to identify the religion of the pupils by looking at them.
20:53.460 - 20:58.020:  Yes, France has a strict ban on religious symbols in state schools and government buildings.
20:58.580 - 21:04.200:  Back in 2004, schoolgirls were banned from wearing headscarves. The debate has intensified since
21:04.200 - 21:09.280:  a teacher who'd shown caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad was beheaded by a Chechen refugee.
21:09.980 - 21:14.200:  One of a series of Islamist attacks France has suffered over the past decade.
21:14.920 - 21:19.780:  I asked our correspondent in Paris, Husco Field, what the reaction has been to this latest ban.
21:44.300 - 22:00.900:  It does put them in a difficult situation, having to police this, for many of them
22:16.480 - 22:21.860:  and the murder of Samuel Pati three years ago after he'd shown some cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his class.
22:22.260 - 22:30.000:  Yes, and it remains to be seen how exactly the definition of an abaya is laid out in the text,
22:30.000 - 22:36.560:  which must have accompanied this declaration of the minister. I think that is one of the most important points
22:36.560 - 22:43.100:  is whether this will stand up in law or how do you define an abaya. Certain people who oppose this
22:43.100 - 22:52.400:  are saying, well, you know, do all long dresses become under this ban? How do you differentiate between
22:52.400 - 22:58.320:  a Muslim abaya and a long Gucci robe which might be very fashionable? There's a lot of grain
22:58.320 - 23:03.960:  in all of this and I imagine this where opponents will hope to slip in with a legal challenge.
23:04.180 - 23:10.060:  Husco Field in Paris. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has published far-reaching
23:10.060 - 23:14.600:  guidance for governments on what they should do to protect children from the effects of climate change.
23:15.220 - 23:20.980:  The guidance says children have a right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and that
23:20.980 - 23:27.020:  countries must act urgently to ensure that right is guaranteed. Image and folks reports.
23:27.760 - 23:33.240:  The UN says climate change is affecting children's rights to life, survival and development.
23:33.340 - 23:38.460:  Young children are among the most vulnerable to climate-related extreme weather,
23:38.460 - 23:43.660:  yet in the debate on how to tackle climate change, their voices are seldom heard.
23:44.360 - 23:49.160:  The UN included young people when drawing up the new guidance, which tells governments
23:49.160 - 23:55.660:  they should phase out fossil fuels and switch to renewables. Governments are responsible not
23:55.660 - 24:01.520:  just for protecting children from immediate harm, but from the future effects of climate change,
24:01.520 - 24:08.100:  the UN says, and they can be held accountable for environmental damage both inside their own
24:08.100 - 24:15.520:  borders and beyond them. 196 countries and territories have ratified the UN Convention on the
24:15.520 - 24:21.980:  Rights of the Child. This guidance applies to all of them, but like so many UN conventions,
24:22.820 - 24:27.600:  this one too is often honoured more in the breach than the observance.
24:28.140 - 24:33.080:  Image and folks. Scientists in China say the recent floods that killed more than 80 people
24:33.080 - 24:37.860:  are a result of climate change. Many people have been shocked by the fact that the floods,
24:37.860 - 24:43.100:  which also caused vast economic damage, struck parts of the country which don't normally
24:43.100 - 24:48.980:  experience disasters like this. Scientists are warning that such extreme weather events are likely
24:48.980 - 24:55.240:  to happen even more frequently in the future. Our reporter, Stephen McDonald, visited China's flood
24:55.240 - 25:02.720:  plane and also the usually flood-free north of the country. Cars driving down this street in
25:02.720 - 25:08.620:  Georgia will still have to make their way through the remains of the flood waters and an awful
25:08.620 - 25:16.480:  loss of mud. As part of the town was hit worst when the flood waters raged through and on either
25:16.480 - 25:23.420:  side of the road there are electric vehicles which are brown in colour. They were completely
25:23.420 - 25:30.140:  underwater and beside them are the shops which obviously have borne the brunt of this in terms of
25:30.140 - 25:36.080:  their businesses. You can see the brown marks where the flood water swallowed up the first floor
25:36.080 - 25:46.520:  of these businesses. It will take me 8 to 10 years to recover from these losses. The government has
25:46.520 - 25:52.120:  not said whether it will compensate us. I want two shops, but what can we do?
25:55.380 - 26:03.120:  We suffered big losses, trucks and other vehicles. Our goose, furniture, everything we own was
26:03.120 - 26:10.280:  wrecked. Every day we keep trying to clear more mud out. I can't describe how I felt when I saw
26:11.560 - 26:19.040:  this. It's as if our life's work is over. This is the human face of what Chinese scientists say
26:19.040 - 26:24.220:  is the inevitable impact of climate change producing more and more extreme weather events.
26:25.340 - 26:30.060:  And official data would appear to back this up. In a little over a decade the number of floods
26:30.060 - 26:35.360:  being recorded in this country has increased 10 fold. What's more this year,
26:35.960 - 26:40.960:  floodwaters have hit parts of the country where it's been unheard of, threatening precious food
26:40.960 - 26:48.000:  supplies. In August 40% of the famous Wuchang rice crop was wiped out in northeast China's
26:48.000 - 26:51.260:  Hellongjiang province. The impact is clear when you visit.
26:54.600 - 27:00.640:  The fields where we planted our crops were all submerged. We come plant again this year.
27:01.200 - 27:07.220:  The losses are incaculable. We have tens of thousands of acres of rice fields here.
27:08.100 - 27:13.980:  This local farmer smiled as she spoke and was happy that her family was safe, but said they have
27:13.980 - 27:22.340:  some tough times ahead. When I saw the water come here I cried. It laid witht to everything.
27:23.160 - 27:25.820:  I'm scared the typhoons will be back.
27:26.880 - 27:31.100:  A neighbor standing nearby explained how strange this is all been for them.
27:33.820 - 27:37.000:  I've never seen floods here in all my life. This is the first time.
27:40.920 - 27:45.560:  A four-hour flight away across several provinces, you enter the part of the country which
27:45.560 - 27:50.200:  actually should have floods, but here there are fears of a drought closing in.
27:50.920 - 27:56.000:  Lich and Shui grew up next to Poyang Lake, and drives the boat out to Lorshin
27:56.000 - 28:01.920:  to do an island when there's enough water to do so. This year the area has become much drier
28:01.920 - 28:10.580:  much earlier. This year's water level is very low. Old people say this has only occurred once
28:10.580 - 28:19.220:  before in the early 1950s. Right next to me is an island and on top of it there's a temple from
28:19.220 - 28:25.260:  the Song Dynasty. At the moment it's accessible by land and soon there'll be no water around it
28:25.320 - 28:30.680:  at all. And people are using this historic site as something of an environmental barometer
28:31.460 - 28:35.920:  to measure whether or not water is at the correct level at any given time of year.
28:37.240 - 28:42.460:  Droughts to sudden floods extreme weather is a game drawing attention to the impact of climate
28:42.460 - 28:47.800:  change on China, and whether or not the measures in place to fight it are currently ambitious
28:47.800 - 28:54.300:  enough to rein in the destructive force of these potentially catastrophic events.
28:56.180 - 29:02.060:  That report by our China correspondent Stephen McDonald. Hundreds of people with red hair have
29:02.060 - 29:07.380:  descended on the Netherlands. They've been celebrating their rare and often striking hair color
29:07.700 - 29:12.360:  by joining people just like them for the Red Head Day Festival, which takes place in the town
29:12.380 - 29:18.620:  of Tilburg every year when the Urquod reports. It's a well-known fact that red-headed people get
29:18.620 - 29:25.280:  teased a lot and some even get bullied just because of the color of their hair. Liam Hunter from
29:25.280 - 29:29.680:  Scotland says being with other ginger-haired people makes a massive difference.
29:42.880 - 29:49.000:  In case you're wondering, redheads don't just come from Scotland. Around 5,000 people with red hair
29:49.000 - 29:55.120:  came from all over the world to take part in the festival. Jesse Christensen traveled from Las Vegas
29:55.120 - 30:00.040:  just to see people who look like her. The big motivation was just have a sense of community
30:00.040 - 30:05.880:  as a redhead because it can feel isolating when you don't see a lot of people like you and here.
30:06.400 - 30:10.520:  It's just so exciting to see everyone with red hair, no matter the shade of color,
30:10.520 - 30:15.700:  come together and celebrate what has made us unique in our own homes and countries.
30:16.260 - 30:22.540:  Portrait photographer Hans Dixon Smith is married to a redhead and he loves taking photos of
30:22.540 - 30:29.100:  everyone at the festival. I just like to do this kind of work. I find all that red hair beautiful.
30:29.660 - 30:33.840:  Mostly I take my pictures in black and white, but of course that's not possible at this festival,
30:33.840 - 30:41.700:  but I think it's fantastic. The redhead festival began in 2005 after amateur painter Bart Roanhurst
30:41.900 - 30:49.520:  advertised for 15 models with red hair and 150 turned up. He decided to make it an annual event
30:49.520 - 30:56.700:  and so far it's been a massive success. Wendy Irkhardt and participants were able to compare their
30:56.700 - 31:04.960:  hair color against the wall chart with shades from pumpkin to terracotta to my favourite cartoon cat.
31:07.620 - 31:12.740:  And that's it from this edition of the Global News Podcast, but there will be a new one later.
31:12.960 - 31:17.240:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email. The
31:17.240 - 31:24.920:  address is globalpodcastatvbc.co.uk. This edition was mixed by Ethan Connelly Foster,
31:24.920 - 31:30.860:  the producer was Marion Straun, the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Janelle. Until next time, goodbye.
