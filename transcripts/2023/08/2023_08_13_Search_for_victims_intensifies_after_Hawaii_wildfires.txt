00:18.700 - 00:24.400:  podcast from the BBC World Service, where we try to help you make sense of the world around you,
00:24.580 - 00:28.820:  of the big things that are happening, the small things that are happening and everything in between.

00:36.220 - 00:39.440:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:41.200 - 00:46.180:  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Sunday the 13th of August. These are our main stories.
00:46.800 - 00:51.280:  Disaster management officials are sending more resources to the Hawaiian island of Maui
00:51.280 - 00:57.260:  as the search for victims of deadly wildfires continues. A doctor has been given access to
00:57.260 - 01:02.720:  Niger's ousted president who's been held prisoner in abasement since last month's coup. Saudi
01:02.720 - 01:10.000:  Arabia is appointing its first ambassador to the Palestinian Authority. Also in this podcast,
01:10.760 - 01:18.520:  they speak of another time and another place, a stunning combination of pure commercialism
01:18.520 - 01:25.460:  and a kind of ageless beauty. An exhibition showcases the neon signs of Hong Kong
01:25.980 - 01:30.140:  that used to light up the city's night sky, but many of which have now disappeared.
01:34.100 - 01:39.980:  We begin in Hawaii, officials say 80 people have died in wildfires that have devastated the island
01:39.980 - 01:45.060:  of Maui. Hawaii's Attorney General has ordered an investigation into the handling of the fire
01:45.440 - 01:49.400:  as questions grow over whether the authorities could have done more to warn residents.
01:50.040 - 01:53.860:  Our correspondent John Sudworth sent this report from near the town of Lahaina,
01:54.100 - 01:59.800:  which has been ruined by the blaze. More expert help is on its way to the town of Lahaina for
01:59.800 - 02:04.620:  the difficult task of combing through the charred embers for signs of human remains.
02:04.620 - 02:09.720:  Some homes and buildings have not yet been searched and the authorities are warning that the number
02:09.720 - 02:15.880:  of confirmed deaths is likely to rise further still. Captain Vince Carter is a local helicopter pilot
02:15.880 - 02:23.000:  and has seen the devastation from the air. There was a pit in your stomach knowing that this is just
02:23.000 - 02:27.900:  the tip of the spear, you know, losing buildings, losing property, asking by the marina that you
02:27.900 - 02:33.520:  could see there was still boats on fire, wooden slips that the dots were gone. So we're talking
02:33.520 - 02:38.220:  things that were floating on water that it was so hot that those lit on fire. While the forensic
02:38.220 - 02:43.800:  work continues, there's another major challenge. Housing and feeding the thousands made homeless
02:43.800 - 02:48.900:  by the wildfire. Access into the town, which was almost completely destroyed earlier this week,
02:49.340 - 02:54.240:  is restricted to residents only and there have been long tail backs for those trying to return
02:54.240 - 03:01.040:  by car to retrieve what few belongings they can, even while firefighters continue to tackle flare-ups.
03:01.520 - 03:06.580:  Many are still searching for news of missing family members, an effort complicated by the still
03:06.580 - 03:12.800:  disrupted phone and power networks. While the mood remains calm here, there are hints of anger too,
03:13.080 - 03:17.380:  with questions about whether the authorities could have provided more warning of the impending
03:17.380 - 03:23.020:  disaster. A review of official decision-making has been announced by Hawaii's attorney general.
03:23.640 - 03:28.900:  The American Red Cross has set up emergency shelters on Maui. My colleague Lucy Gray spoke to
03:28.900 - 03:32.860:  its national spokesman Todd James and asked about the challenges they're facing.
03:33.500 - 03:39.740:  The main focus of our work continues to be sheltering, working with our partners, the local and
03:39.740 - 03:44.420:  state government and our nonprofit partners in the area because we've got to make sure that all of
03:44.420 - 03:48.500:  these families who have been displaced have a safe place to stay, have access to food,
03:48.840 - 03:54.340:  to medical care and to crisis counseling, and of course, knowing that they've got a safe place
03:54.340 - 03:59.600:  to go until they figure out what their next steps are. We've had thousands of people coming through
03:59.600 - 04:05.780:  the shelters, we've had over 2,900 overnight stays so far, and a lot of folks who are coming into
04:05.780 - 04:10.660:  the shelter during the day, they can charge their phones, they can get a meal, they can talk to
04:11.020 - 04:14.460:  some of the other partners we have in the shelters with us to get the information,
04:14.460 - 04:18.660:  and if they need to stay, then they know they're more than welcome to stay with us. So that is
04:18.660 - 04:24.720:  our big focus right now. Once it's safe and we get the word from officials that we can begin going
04:24.720 - 04:29.020:  out, we'll assist with the damage assessment of the area, and then we'll start distributing some
04:29.020 - 04:32.660:  of the emergency supplies that families will need when they start the cleaning process.
04:33.280 - 04:37.600:  And is it the case that some people haven't been reached yet? I mean, we're hearing that
04:37.600 - 04:42.880:  hundreds of thought to be uncontactable, that unaccounted thought, does that mean that they
04:42.880 - 04:48.660:  haven't been reached? You know, I haven't gotten any direct information, I wouldn't be surprised
04:48.660 - 04:53.280:  if there are some difficulties getting old of some folks, you know, there's a lot of confusion.
04:53.280 - 05:00.120:  The infrastructure is down, the communications, electricity, water, all of that, you know,
05:00.160 - 05:05.140:  is not functioning or barely working in some areas affected by the fire, so that makes it very tough.
05:05.140 - 05:09.800:  So I'm sure the officials are doing all they can. It's still a search of rescue operation.
05:10.440 - 05:15.380:  So that's why they're restricting access, I believe, but whoever needs shelter, if there's
05:15.400 - 05:19.660:  still folks out there and they make their way to our shelter, they're going to find a welcome
05:19.660 - 05:24.480:  arm from a Red Cross volunteer who will get them settled, get them a meal and make sure they
05:24.480 - 05:28.860:  have access to everything they need right now. Todd James of the American Red Cross.
05:29.720 - 05:34.480:  The family doctor of the ousted president of Nichea, Mohamed Bazoum, has said he's in good
05:34.480 - 05:39.480:  spirits after visiting the deposed leader. Mr. Bazoum and his family have been held captive
05:39.480 - 05:43.800:  in the basement of the presidential palace since he was removed from office by the military
05:43.800 - 05:48.480:  last month. The doctor who brought them food and medicines said their living conditions were
05:48.480 - 05:55.060:  difficult. Here's Richard Hamilton. The doctor's visit reportedly came as a huge relief to the
05:55.060 - 06:00.240:  president, his wife and their 20-year-old son, who has a serious medical condition.
06:01.100 - 06:06.880:  Earlier, the UN Human Rights Chief Falkerturk said the conditions of their detention were
06:06.880 - 06:13.920:  inhumane, degrading, and in violation of international human rights law. But despite the widespread
06:13.920 - 06:20.700:  condemnation, the military junta continues to hold Mr. Bazoum, presumably as a hostage,
06:20.700 - 06:25.480:  to make West African leaders think twice about military intervention.
06:26.600 - 06:31.600:  Armenia has called for the UN Security Council to hold an urgent meeting on the deteriorating
06:31.600 - 06:37.420:  humanitarian situation in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia has accused
06:37.420 - 06:41.280:  neighbouring Azerbaijan of preventing supplies being delivered to the region.
06:41.860 - 06:46.400:  The enclave, which is landlocked within Azerbaijan, but largely populated by ethnic
06:46.400 - 06:52.980:  Armenians, is only connected to Armenia by a single short mountain road. Armenia and Azerbaijan
06:52.980 - 07:00.260:  have fought two wars over the territory since the 1980s. The last in 2022 saw Azerbaijan make
07:00.260 - 07:05.440:  substantial territorial gains. Rebecca Kesby has been talking to Mohamed Margarayan,
07:05.740 - 07:10.520:  Armenia's ambassador to the UN, and asked him about the appeal to the Security Council.
07:11.160 - 07:16.520:  We have been warning the international community that the alarming situation in Nagorno-Karabakh
07:16.540 - 07:22.300:  is close to turning into humanitarian catastrophe for some month now. And the closure of this
07:22.300 - 07:28.640:  vital lifeline by Azerbaijan has been instigating conditions of a man-made humanitarian catastrophe.
07:29.260 - 07:34.620:  Today is exactly eight months that thousands of besieged families in Nagorno-Karabakh have been
07:34.620 - 07:40.340:  suffering from critical shortages of essential goods, including food, fuel, and medical supplies.
07:40.900 - 07:47.020:  And we think that it is up to the Security Council to uphold its responsibility for the
07:47.020 - 07:53.040:  maintenance of international peace and security, then to take appropriate measures to prevent
07:53.040 - 07:59.240:  mass atrocities, including ethnic cleansing and the crime of genocide from happening in Nagorno-Karabakh.
07:59.920 - 08:06.300:  What can you tell us about the situation with Azerbaijan? I mean, have you asked them to reopen
08:06.300 - 08:12.300:  that road? Presumably, you have. Not only that we have asked them, the international court
08:12.300 - 08:18.400:  of justice issued provisional measure in February, and then one again, reappeared in July,
08:19.060 - 08:24.260:  according to which Azerbaijan should take all measures to ensure an impeded movement of persons,
08:24.260 - 08:29.940:  vehicles, and cargo along the large encoded door, which Azerbaijan is not implementing to this day.
08:29.940 - 08:35.880:  The Secretary-General of the United Nations made three statements. One in December,
08:35.880 - 08:41.280:  the other one in February, and the most recent one on the 3rd of August, calling for the
08:41.520 - 08:47.320:  unconditional implementation of international court of justice is ruling and reaffirming the
08:47.320 - 08:53.640:  binding nature of that. Many international organizations called upon Azerbaijan to implement the
08:53.640 - 09:00.840:  court order, and we have appealed also to the Security Council a month ago, asking the Security
09:00.840 - 09:07.480:  Council specifically to undertake urgent and effective measures in response to Azerbaijan's
09:07.480 - 09:12.840:  violation of international humanitarian law, and to ensure the implementation of legally
09:12.840 - 09:17.600:  binding orders of international court of justice. Nothing happened so far.
09:18.040 - 09:22.320:  The BBC did approach the government of Azerbaijan for comments, but they didn't respond to us.
09:23.100 - 09:28.180:  French and British Coast Guards have rescued 58 people from a boat full of migrants that got into
09:28.180 - 09:33.780:  difficulty in the English Channel on Saturday. Six people are known to have died. Those rescued
09:33.780 - 09:39.460:  include children, most of them from Afghanistan and Sudan. Frank Dersin is vice president of the
09:39.460 - 09:44.240:  Oat de France region on the French coast. He told us how difficult it is to police migrants who
09:44.240 - 09:52.400:  are determined to make the crossing. Nothing can stop the will of migrants to pass. We can only
09:52.400 - 09:59.020:  slow it down. When they are on the boat, it's impossible to stop. We have to stop the people
09:59.020 - 10:05.720:  before they go inside the boat. The Coast Guard has taken many of the survivors to Cali. Rebecca
10:05.720 - 10:10.380:  Kersby spoke to our correspondent Bethany Bell, who's in the French port, and asked her what the
10:10.380 - 10:17.060:  authorities think happened. They're still trying to find that out. Many of the people who are well
10:17.060 - 10:23.240:  enough to speak to the authorities are being questioned at the moment to try and establish how
10:23.320 - 10:30.220:  they were out on this overcrowded boat. In very windy conditions, when of course it capsized,
10:30.700 - 10:36.200:  and investigation has been launched at the moment to try and see how this tragedy took place.
10:36.820 - 10:42.580:  I mean hundreds of migrants do try to make this journey every day but it's incredibly dangerous
10:42.760 - 10:47.840:  isn't it? I mean this is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world and the water even in
10:47.840 - 10:55.560:  the summer is very cold. Extremely cold and as you say an extremely busy area, 600 tankers,
10:55.560 - 11:02.740:  200 ferries around about passing every day and you know difficult currents. Last night the winds
11:02.740 - 11:08.920:  were strong and France's Secretary of State for the Sea, responsible for safety at sea,
11:09.400 - 11:15.820:  was saying that the trafficers didn't seem to care about sending people out in a small dinghy
11:15.820 - 11:21.200:  in such conditions and it was very distressing scenes that we've seen.
11:21.500 - 11:28.180:  And briefly we heard there a French voice from the authorities. This is a political issue on both
11:28.180 - 11:35.120:  sides of the channel but in the UK the rules have changed recently which is leading to quite a
11:35.120 - 11:41.960:  lot of controversy. Well the A-groups that we've been speaking to here in in Calais say that they
11:41.960 - 11:49.520:  do warn migrants about the problems, the risks of trying to make this crossing and what awaits them
11:49.520 - 11:55.620:  on the other side but many of them as we heard just there say they they can't stop them if people are
11:55.620 - 12:00.580:  determined to try and get over it's very very difficult to stop it and one of the interesting things
12:00.580 - 12:07.840:  that we've been told is that it does seem that more migrants have been coming to this region
12:07.840 - 12:14.060:  in recent weeks they're living rough along the shores, hopes possibly that now that the summer
12:14.060 - 12:19.580:  weather has come it might be easier to make the crossing but certainly an uptick in numbers.
12:20.340 - 12:24.800:  Our correspondent Bethany Bell in Calais, the authorities in the Czech Republic have
12:24.800 - 12:30.820:  appealed for calm after a teenage girl was raped and left for dead allegedly by an 18-year-old
12:30.820 - 12:37.740:  Ukrainian man, his Rob Cameron. Tuesday's shocking rape and attempted murder in the city of
12:37.740 - 12:44.300:  Pusen has been condemned by both Czech and Ukrainian politicians including Ukraine's deputy foreign
12:44.300 - 12:51.960:  minister who was until recently ambassador to Prague. The girl aged around 15 reportedly knew her
12:51.960 - 12:57.920:  alleged attacker and agreed to go for an evening walk with him. Police say she was then tied up,
12:57.920 - 13:04.160:  blindfolded, raped, stabbed, placed in a sack and pushed down a slope. She played dead
13:04.160 - 13:09.800:  before managing to free herself. Now for decades there were a visual symbol of Hong Kong,
13:09.800 - 13:15.160:  the neon signs that lit up the city's night sky. In recent years many of them have disappeared
13:15.160 - 13:21.520:  thanks in part to safety concerns and worries about the environment. Now a new exhibition is showcasing
13:21.520 - 13:34.580:  them in all their glory, Tim Orman reports. They speak of another time and another place,
13:35.680 - 13:43.960:  a stunning combination of pure commercialism and a kind of ageless beauty. The signs represented
13:43.960 - 13:51.800:  all that was unique and magical about Hong Kong, literally illuminating, inspiring and iconic.
13:53.660 - 13:59.260:  They are an increasingly rare species these days that there are still people like Cardin Chan
13:59.260 - 14:05.340:  who want to restore them and show them off. It's not only about appreciation of the beauty
14:05.340 - 14:12.580:  of the signs up close, it's also about like to appreciate, to understand the scale and then also
14:12.580 - 14:20.020:  the works that goes into each of these signs. This exhibition shines a light on Hong Kong's cultural
14:20.020 - 14:26.740:  history, an opportunity for some to see a world they never knew and for some to relive their past.
14:30.260 - 14:35.560:  It's really worth recommending to others, so this visitor. It's conserving the history of Hong
14:35.660 - 14:41.080:  Kong. We saw these signs when we were young, but as time goes by many of them disappear.
14:45.140 - 14:51.020:  Not so far away, another neon sign is taken down. Advertising a Kaolun restaurant,
14:51.020 - 14:56.620:  it's been in place for nearly 60 years. The owners say they've asked for permission to erect a new
14:56.620 - 15:04.800:  smaller sign, but a chap that is closing for Hong Kong in so many ways, the lights are going out.
15:05.940 - 15:12.320:  Tim Almond reporting. Still to come we'll meet the scientist who wanted to save a bit of his
15:12.320 - 15:18.680:  favourite glacier in Switzerland. And I thought now it's a time to go up there one last time and
15:18.940 - 15:20.500:  save a bit of this ice.
15:27.500 - 15:32.260:  World football where the women's world cup is the podcast telling the global story of the tournament.
15:35.420 - 15:40.040:  We're speaking to the fans who have traveled down under as they share all the excitement of
15:40.040 - 15:45.380:  this incredible competition. I think we're still in the running, they go all the way. I'm really
15:45.380 - 15:48.900:  really proud of Vietnamese. This is probably the biggest moment in their careers and Australians
15:48.900 - 15:54.840:  right behind them. World football at the women's world cup from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever
15:54.840 - 16:01.760:  you get your BBC podcasts. Saudi Arabia has named its first non-resident ambassador for the
16:01.760 - 16:06.800:  Palestinian territories. The move follows growing speculation that Saudi Arabia and Israel
16:07.240 - 16:12.180:  could soon reach an agreement to normalise relations. Here's our Middle East regional editor Mike
16:12.180 - 16:18.140:  Thompson. Saudi Arabia has long maintained that the normalisation of relations with Israel,
16:18.140 - 16:24.060:  which it currently does not recognise, is dependent on the establishment of a Palestinian state.
16:24.660 - 16:30.360:  So talk that the country could soon normalise relations without this will have alarmed many
16:30.360 - 16:36.780:  Palestinians. It appears that creating this new ambassadorial position, which also includes the
16:36.780 - 16:43.080:  role of consul general to Jerusalem, is designed to show that Riyadh wouldn't abandon its support
16:43.080 - 16:48.940:  for the Palestinian cause. The new job is to be filled by the Kingdom's ambassador to Jordan.
16:49.480 - 16:53.040:  Now you have Al-Sadari. According to the conservation organisation
16:53.040 - 17:00.760:  WWF, or the Worldwide Fund for Nature, there are around 415,000 African elephants left in the
17:00.760 - 17:06.960:  world and a maximum of 50,000 Asian elephants. Some estimates suggest the populations have
17:06.960 - 17:13.640:  halved in 50 years because of ivory poaching in Africa and habitat loss in Asia. A decade ago,
17:13.640 - 17:18.660:  animal campaigners set up World Elephant Day on the 12th of August to highlight the plight of
17:18.660 - 17:23.140:  elephants around the world. This year, they're focusing on Asian elephants in particular,
17:23.560 - 17:26.960:  as our environment correspondent Navingson Kanka has been telling me.
17:27.540 - 17:33.460:  Unlike with African elephants, the issue with these elephants is that they are now deprived
17:33.460 - 17:39.180:  of their habitat because forests are shrinking. And then that is why they come in contact with
17:39.180 - 17:45.660:  humans and there is conflict, retaliatory killing as it is known. And also, not to forget,
17:45.660 - 17:51.480:  the infrastructure building across all these countries, roads, railways, bridges, canals,
17:52.360 - 17:57.840:  obstruct their migratory paths. And finally, the tourism industry or even mining,
17:57.840 - 18:04.180:  you know, elephants are used in all those activities. That's why these animals, they are still so
18:04.180 - 18:09.500:  endangered. So lots of ways in which mankind is getting in the way of the elephants. What about
18:09.500 - 18:15.060:  what governments are doing to try and stop this decline? We don't see very much good stories.
18:15.060 - 18:21.620:  One example often quoted in Myanmar, the identified 170,000 square kilometers for elephants.
18:21.620 - 18:28.520:  But then what they also found later on by an independent investigation was only 7% of that 170,000
18:28.520 - 18:33.800:  square kilometers of a habitat was protected. How does this play out in India and Nepal,
18:33.800 - 18:39.080:  past the world that you know so well? We all know about Assam tea, for example. So I went to
18:39.080 - 18:45.620:  Assam tea states. We found these tea states were actually spreading, you know, right on where the
18:45.620 - 18:50.980:  traditional elephants' migratory routes are. So now what they find is instead of their forests
18:50.980 - 18:57.260:  or water holes, they find tea. And tea is something elephants don't eat. And they're very angry
18:57.260 - 19:02.900:  about it. And that's why what happens is elephants get into villages, kill people, and then people
19:02.900 - 19:08.140:  in turn kill elephants. That story is being played out not just in Putan or India, but also in Nepal
19:08.140 - 19:14.120:  and elsewhere. And then if you look at India's social media, we'll see trains knocking off
19:14.120 - 19:21.200:  elephants, even calves being killed on tracks. We need to identify where are those traditional
19:21.200 - 19:27.580:  migratory routes. And then think about the solutions that you could dovetail with your development
19:27.580 - 19:32.420:  plans. Otherwise, what happens is elephants will keep on getting angry, seeing those tea states
19:32.420 - 19:37.240:  or palm oil forests or rubber plantations instead of their natural forests.
19:37.960 - 19:42.700:  Our environment correspondent, Navingsyn Kadkeh, now to football and we know the four teams
19:42.700 - 19:47.940:  still in contention to win the women's world cup. The co-hosts of Australia survived a tense
19:47.940 - 19:53.720:  penalty shootout to defeat France. England came from behind to beat Colombia. Our correspondent
19:53.720 - 19:59.680:  in Sydney, Shima Halil, watched the day's action. I think I've aged 10 years and almost lost my
19:59.680 - 20:04.420:  voice in those two matches. The good news is this has been one of the most entertaining, exciting,
20:04.420 - 20:10.960:  nerve-wracking days of the whole tournament. First off, let's start with Australia versus France.
20:10.960 - 20:15.460:  It was neck and neck until the very last minute and that penalty shootout. There was just
20:15.460 - 20:21.840:  collective gasps and intakes of breath with every hit and miss. And then onto the England
20:21.900 - 20:27.520:  Colombia game. And we all knew that this wasn't going to be an easy game. Colombia, this
20:27.520 - 20:33.680:  underdog of a team have delivered some of the most dramatic and memorable moments. But I must say
20:33.680 - 20:39.360:  kudos to England's defense kudos to that team that just kept running and running. And of course,
20:39.360 - 20:45.680:  these two goals from Lauren Hemp to equalize with Colombia and then the winning goal from Alicea Russo.
20:45.960 - 20:50.820:  I think they delivered the win that so many fans have wanted. And I will tell you right now,
20:50.820 - 20:56.040:  I'm calling it a lioness versus the Matilda's game is going to break so many records in terms of
20:56.040 - 21:01.240:  your ship. I understand that 4,000 England fans have traveled for the world cup. Some of them
21:01.240 - 21:05.700:  wanted tickets and they couldn't have them. So the next best thing is that they came to the fan zone.
21:06.380 - 21:11.820:  And I think what's really interesting is the confidence that they have in the team that even though
21:11.820 - 21:17.840:  they were quite nervous about how they performed against Nigeria every time I ask somewhat about
21:17.840 - 21:22.540:  how they felt about the lioness as they just said were confident, the rivalry is going to be there.
21:22.720 - 21:28.440:  But I will say this, I think the atmosphere is going to be electric. I think on the pitch,
21:29.180 - 21:33.320:  they both have a point to prove. Both teams know that there are a couple of steps away from
21:33.320 - 21:38.960:  making history for their country and their squads. So it is going to be a very strong game. I think
21:38.960 - 21:43.180:  it's going to get really, really physical. But I think off the pitch it's going to be very, very
21:43.180 - 21:46.600:  enjoyable. And I think maybe I'll age another 10 years watching that game.
21:46.820 - 21:51.880:  I correspond to Shima Halil. Let's hear from some fans now. Here's the reaction of some Australia
21:58.960 - 22:02.500:  supporters watching in Sydney. And here's England fan Jessica who watched the game in her hometown
22:02.500 - 22:07.200:  of Donkester. It's amazing. I'm so happy with the way that they played and they've been pushing
22:07.200 - 22:11.380:  through. And that's all they can do is hold their own and push to the next round. And that's
22:11.380 - 22:15.880:  the most important thing that it's amazing also for young players to look up to these players and
22:15.880 - 22:20.320:  know that it's possible to make it there and that the women's game is just growing every year. So
22:20.320 - 22:26.860:  it was awesome. The first of the two semi-finals on Tuesday between Sweden and Spain. Let's stay
22:26.860 - 22:31.280:  with football. He's the captain of the English team, the country's record goal scorer. But
22:31.540 - 22:36.120:  Harry Kane's first night playing in the German Bundesliga certainly hasn't gone to plan.
22:36.400 - 22:41.720:  Brought on as a replacement striker on Saturday. The day he signed for Bayern Munich, they then lost
22:41.720 - 22:47.680:  the German Super Cup final to RB Leipzig. I've been talking to Joe Inwood who spent the day outside
22:47.680 - 22:51.780:  the stadium in Munich. So not the dream start that Harry Kane might have wanted.
22:52.520 - 22:57.060:  No, but I think it probably would have been too good to be true. How did he come on and
22:57.340 - 23:03.540:  brought Bayern down, back from 2-0 down to RB Leipzig. He barely, the truth is he didn't get much
23:03.540 - 23:08.460:  of a touch of the ball. He came on in about the sixtieth minute or so. He ran around gamely,
23:08.460 - 23:12.720:  but I think it was beyond even a man of his prodigious talents. I mean, it's worth pointing out.
23:13.100 - 23:18.520:  Harry Kane wouldn't have even had a chance to train properly with his new teammates. In the end,
23:18.520 - 23:25.040:  they lost 3-0. So Harry Kane's 19-year wait for silverware continues, at least for this day,
23:25.040 - 23:29.420:  probably until the end of the season. Harry Kane's been at Tottenham Hotspur, the English
23:29.420 - 23:35.000:  Premier League club for 20 years. Here, as I said, the England captain, record goal scorer,
23:35.220 - 23:38.980:  why does he want to go and play in Germany? A number of reasons. I mean, firstly, it's a lovely
23:38.980 - 23:44.020:  country to be in, to live in. It's a beautiful city that he has here in Munich, but I think in terms
23:44.020 - 23:49.240:  of the football, he got some great clubs. Bayern is a fantastic side, obviously a great international
23:49.240 - 23:54.020:  reputation, highest quality football, but also very well-run. It's one of the things that's
23:54.240 - 23:59.440:  commonly said about German clubs is they don't overspend. He is indeed the most expensive player
23:59.440 - 24:04.260:  any German clubs ever bought, and I think they know it's going to be a well-run team. But more than
24:04.260 - 24:08.800:  that, the reason Harry Kane wanted to come here is to win trophies. And it's worth, you know,
24:08.800 - 24:13.500:  this cup, the super cup that they didn't win today, they've won for six of the seven previous
24:13.500 - 24:18.680:  seasons, they've won more than 10 Bundesliga in a row. So I think it probably will be assumed that
24:18.680 - 24:23.460:  he will win trophies if he comes here, even if he didn't do it today. Joe Inwood in Munich.
24:24.140 - 24:29.040:  Campaigners in Britain have raised concerns that betting firms are targeting adverts at players
24:29.040 - 24:35.040:  of the online game fantasy Premier League or FPL, which is popular with children. Millions of
24:35.040 - 24:39.720:  people around the world play FPL, which you have to do is pick a team of footballers and then you
24:39.720 - 24:46.900:  earn points based on their real-life performance. Anyone over 13 can play as a result. It's a target
24:46.900 - 24:52.520:  for the global gambling industry recruiting their next generation of customers. Rob Wayne is an
24:52.520 - 25:00.520:  FPL content creator. I cannot think of many major fantasy Premier League websites that do not
25:00.520 - 25:06.560:  advertise gambling or have some form of affiliation with a gambling company or a subsidiary of a
25:06.560 - 25:12.860:  gambling company. And those major websites have signed pretty much every major content creator of
25:12.860 - 25:17.440:  fantasy football and fantasy Premier League. Tom Grundy told me more about the game.
25:17.960 - 25:23.340:  It's huge. I think last year 11 million people signed up in total and just under half of those
25:23.340 - 25:28.300:  are in the UK. So that's an awful lot of people around the world. But there's also this huge
25:28.860 - 25:34.740:  subculture community that's grown up around it as well, made up of independent websites not
25:34.740 - 25:40.400:  affiliated to the Premier League content creators with thousands of followers or all making a living
25:41.100 - 25:47.000:  based on sharing tools and tips to do with FPL. And that seems to be where these betting companies
25:47.000 - 25:51.000:  are trying to find a way in. We know how big the English Premier League is with our listeners all
25:51.000 - 25:55.760:  over the world on the world service, particularly with the biggest clubs. And gambling is clearly
25:55.760 - 26:02.560:  part of football. It's just suddenly becoming part of this app. Yeah, basically we've got these
26:02.560 - 26:09.300:  independent sites and people are telling me that the betting community have probably seen similarities
26:09.300 - 26:15.060:  between the game fantasy Premier League. It's played by predominantly young men, young men who are
26:15.100 - 26:19.700:  clearly interested in sport. And that ticks a lot of the box same boxes as people who do
26:19.820 - 26:25.320:  traditional sports betting as well. And certainly some of the charities we've been speaking to,
26:25.320 - 26:30.580:  one of which, led on the campaign to get betting ads off Premier League football shirts.
26:31.320 - 26:36.780:  They think that the betting industry see FPL as fertile ground basically for the next generation
26:36.860 - 26:41.140:  of customers and potentially addicts. And there are different rules governing gambling,
26:41.140 - 26:47.380:  especially gambling with any sense of targeting people under 18 in different countries. But when
26:47.680 - 26:51.980:  something's been played internationally, you can get round all that. Yeah, and that's the thing with
26:52.080 - 26:57.600:  perhaps a content creator sending a tweet, for example, that's promoted by a betting company.
26:58.160 - 27:01.780:  Certain people and certain jurisdictions around the world are going to be seeing that where
27:01.960 - 27:07.660:  potentially gambling is illegal. And actually, fantasy sports has a really interesting
27:07.660 - 27:12.520:  relationship with gambling regulation around the world. One of the big companies that we've
27:12.520 - 27:18.500:  seen sponsoring stuff around FPL is Draft Kings. And they're one of the biggest gambling companies
27:18.500 - 27:23.860:  in the US. The reason that they became so big is because there was such tight gambling regulation
27:24.060 - 27:30.020:  in certain states in the US that actually paid fantasy sports with prizes and in a sort of fantasy
27:30.020 - 27:35.900:  format were seen as a way of getting round and getting across these tight gambling rules. And even
27:35.900 - 27:41.480:  though they've been lessened in states now, companies like Draft Kings and Fan, Joule are still
27:41.480 - 27:48.220:  huge and have a huge market share. Joe Grande reporting. Switzerland is known for its snowy peaks
27:48.220 - 27:54.140:  and sky-scraping alpine glaciers. But just like glaciers all over the world, warmer global temperatures
27:54.140 - 28:00.480:  are seeing them start to melt away. One glacial scientist, Matthias Huss, decided to save the last
28:00.480 - 28:06.380:  bit of his favourite class year. And he said his own freezer. Matthias is a senior researcher at
28:06.380 - 28:11.500:  the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. And he's been talking to Rebecca Kespy.
28:12.020 - 28:17.680:  This pittled glacier is a very small glacier in Switzerland. It has been studied since more than
28:17.680 - 28:24.260:  100 years. And since 18 years, at the beginning of my PhD, I went up there to look at it in more
28:24.260 - 28:30.980:  detail, doing measurements on this glacier at least twice a year. And it has strongly declined
28:30.980 - 28:36.680:  in area and thickness. And it has now almost completely disappeared.
28:37.060 - 28:42.200:  How did you know that it was going to disappear? Well, it became thinner and thinner. And then
28:42.200 - 28:49.220:  about four years ago, it started to fall apart. So different pieces of it split off. And more and
28:49.220 - 28:55.600:  more rocks started to protrude out of the ice. So it all went very, very fast in the last few years.
28:55.980 - 29:02.180:  So in 2022, after this extreme melting event of that summer, I need to stop the measurements.
29:02.180 - 29:08.160:  And now there was just this little tiny piece of ice left that I knew it was still old glacier
29:08.160 - 29:14.340:  ice, but just basically a few square meters. And I thought, well, now it's a time to go up there
29:14.340 - 29:20.040:  one last time and save a bit of this ice. I put it in my own freezer for the moment. I will probably
29:20.040 - 29:25.960:  put it at ETH later to the university, but it's not for scientific reasons. So it's not for scientific
29:25.960 - 29:33.460:  analysis, but it's really just for emotional reasons. It's to save this little part of my baby glacier
29:33.460 - 29:40.080:  that I'm very attached onto because obviously climate change will put a complete end to this ice
29:40.160 - 29:44.840:  this year probably maybe maybe next year, but then it's over. I mean, you say it's not for
29:44.840 - 29:50.840:  scientific research, but we do know that glacial ice does contain history, doesn't it, in its own
29:50.840 - 29:58.440:  way, which may be useful scientifically? Yes, exactly. So one can analyze glacier ice in very
29:58.440 - 30:04.780:  much detail, but this is not feasible for these glaciers at low or relatively low elevation that
30:04.780 - 30:10.300:  are so small. So if you go to Antarctica, to Greenland, or at the very high elevation of the Alps,
30:10.540 - 30:15.820:  then you can actually analyze the history of the Earth's climate out of the glacier ice,
30:16.080 - 30:22.020:  but as I said, this is for the bigger ice masses and it's much more demanding than what I did here.
30:22.460 - 30:25.060:  The Glacial Scientist Matthias Hus in Switzerland.
