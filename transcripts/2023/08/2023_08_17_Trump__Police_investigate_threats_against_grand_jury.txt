00:49.200 - 00:54.100:  I was working in a coffee shop in Boston to help pay rent while I was training for the trials.
00:54.200 - 00:57.460:  And so people kept joking and they're like, oh yeah, she just took a two-hour coffee break
00:57.460 - 00:59.920:  and went and ran the Olympic trials bare at that.
01:01.020 - 01:04.360:  On the podium is back with more Olympians and Paralympians

01:12.920 - 01:16.220:  This is the global news podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:18.840 - 01:21.380:  I'm Janet Jereal and in the early hours of Friday,
01:21.380 - 01:23.960:  the 18th of August, these are our main stories.
01:24.680 - 01:29.500:  US officials investigate allegations of threats to intimidate people involved in
01:29.500 - 01:33.380:  former President Donald Trump's election interference case in Georgia.
01:34.540 - 01:39.720:  Dozens of migrants mainly from Senegal are feared to have died after their boat was found
01:39.780 - 01:42.920:  drifting near Cape Verde off the coast of West Africa.
01:44.040 - 01:48.020:  Britain invites the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to visit
01:48.380 - 01:50.120:  outraging human rights groups.
01:52.960 - 01:53.820:  Also in this podcast,
01:59.620 - 02:04.240:  the musician now Rogers accuses a far-right political party in Switzerland
02:04.400 - 02:07.400:  of stealing his hit song We Are Family.
02:12.560 - 02:16.780:  Officials in the US state of Georgia are investigating online threats against
02:16.780 - 02:21.280:  members of the public who voted to indict the former US President Donald Trump
02:21.280 - 02:23.700:  this week as part of a grand jury.
02:24.520 - 02:27.420:  Amid a rise in violent rhetoric by Trump supporters,
02:27.420 - 02:30.520:  the Georgia grand jurors aren't the only ones to be targeted.
02:31.100 - 02:34.580:  A woman in Texas has been charged for threatening to kill a judge
02:34.580 - 02:36.860:  overseeing another case against Mr. Trump.
02:37.480 - 02:42.180:  And last week, FBI agents killed a man in Utah who'd reportedly made
02:42.180 - 02:44.640:  death threats against President Joe Biden.
02:45.160 - 02:48.080:  I got more from our US correspondent, Anthony Sirker.
02:48.860 - 02:52.280:  The Georgia law enforcement is investigating threats made against
02:52.280 - 02:57.400:  members of the grand jury that indicted Donald Trump on Monday.
02:57.800 - 03:03.100:  These threats have been posted in right-wing message boards and chat rooms online.
03:03.140 - 03:08.540:  And information about the jurors has been shared on these right-wing outlets.
03:08.540 - 03:13.260:  I have to remember that the identity of the jurors were made public in the indictment.
03:13.260 - 03:15.740:  That's something that Georgia does routinely.
03:15.740 - 03:19.560:  In any indictment, they list the grand jurors who brought the indictment
03:19.820 - 03:22.760:  in the trove of documents that are publicly released.
03:22.760 - 03:25.580:  So the names of all these jurors were made public.
03:25.580 - 03:28.920:  What has happened is that Donald Trump supporters have taken these names
03:28.920 - 03:33.320:  and done research and posted photographs and posted addresses
03:33.320 - 03:35.580:  and looked into their social media history.
03:36.240 - 03:40.060:  And apparently, according to law enforcement made threats against them.
03:40.240 - 03:42.840:  And that is what law enforcement is looking into,
03:42.840 - 03:46.500:  because this could be an example of a juror intimidation,
03:46.500 - 03:51.600:  something that would disrupt the proper functioning of the legal system in the United States.
03:52.000 - 03:53.340:  Yes, I was going to ask you about that,
03:53.340 - 03:57.300:  because what does this mean for the security of this legal process?
03:57.500 - 04:02.320:  I mean, how do you protect people like jurors and judges when they're being threatened?
04:02.320 - 04:04.460:  That is a very real challenge.
04:04.520 - 04:07.780:  In a state like Georgia that does something like this,
04:07.780 - 04:10.440:  this whole process very openly, very transparently.
04:10.440 - 04:16.620:  And the goal is doing it in public and doing it transparent in order to allow the public
04:16.620 - 04:18.540:  to have greater faith in the legal system.
04:18.540 - 04:23.240:  The downside of that is that bad actors could access the information on these people
04:23.660 - 04:24.400:  and bring threats.
04:24.400 - 04:29.300:  And while law enforcement can look into it and prosecute, if need be,
04:29.680 - 04:30.760:  that happens after the fact.
04:30.780 - 04:33.720:  And there is definitely a chilling effect for future jurors,
04:33.720 - 04:36.880:  for future people who might want to take part in the justice system,
04:36.880 - 04:40.900:  the justice process when they get a juror summons to think twice about doing so,
04:40.900 - 04:47.240:  if they read about how passengers have been targeted by individuals.
04:47.240 - 04:53.360:  There was actually a woman who was recently arrested and charges brought against her in Texas
04:53.360 - 04:59.540:  for phoning in a death threat against the federal judge who was presiding over Donald Trump's
04:59.540 - 05:05.500:  federal trial in Washington, D.C. on charges of election 2020 election interference.
05:05.500 - 05:07.480:  So this is not just something theoretical.
05:07.480 - 05:09.780:  This is something that is happening right now.
05:10.200 - 05:16.680:  And unfortunately, it is something that is very difficult to nip in the bud and control ahead of time.
05:17.440 - 05:22.600:  Anthony ZÃ¼rker, more than 60 migrants are presumed dead after their boat was found drifting
05:22.600 - 05:25.040:  near Cape Verde off the coast of West Africa.
05:25.680 - 05:29.200:  38 people, including several children, were brought to shore.
05:29.200 - 05:34.140:  It's thought they set off from Senegal more than a month ago headed for the Canary Islands.
05:34.680 - 05:35.860:  Mayany Jones reports.
06:04.740 - 06:06.300:  Shekuna died during the journey.
06:06.840 - 06:10.700:  He said they'd both tried getting to Europe by boat just a few weeks earlier.
06:12.760 - 06:14.660:  I would have who died.
06:15.140 - 06:19.220:  We got on a boat to spend together the day after aid and it started to join.
06:19.540 - 06:23.920:  So this letter's trip was Shekuna's second attempt at getting to Europe by boat.
06:24.460 - 06:27.180:  Three days after we came back, he set off again.
06:27.600 - 06:33.200:  He was determined to leave because he had a family and there was nothing for us here in Senegal.
06:33.460 - 06:34.020:  We were fishermen.
06:34.680 - 06:37.160:  We woke all day and we make no money.
06:38.440 - 06:39.820:  He just wanted to feed his family.
06:43.700 - 06:50.000:  A booming population crumbling economies and growing insecurity are pushing young people to leave
06:50.000 - 06:51.500:  West Africa in their thousands.
06:52.240 - 06:58.560:  As legal pathways into Europe tighten, many of them are turning to dangerous illegal routes in search of a better life.
06:59.380 - 07:00.100:  Mayany Jones.
07:00.680 - 07:05.540:  As we heard in our earlier edition, West African military chiefs say they're prepared to use force
07:05.540 - 07:09.180:  to restore democracy in Niger following last month's coup.
07:09.800 - 07:14.460:  They've been meeting in the Ghanaian Capital Accra to discuss the deployment of a stand-by force
07:14.460 - 07:18.720:  for possible military intervention to restore democracy in Niger.
07:19.020 - 07:24.640:  Three members of the bloc, Mali, Bikina Faso and Guinea currently under military rule themselves
07:25.100 - 07:29.300:  support the junta in Niger and oppose any outside military intervention.
07:29.640 - 07:34.500:  My colleague, James Reynolds, spoke to the BBC's Thomas Nadi in Accra in Ghana who's been
07:34.500 - 07:39.660:  covering the meeting of ECOWAS military chiefs and was also joined by the BBC's West Africa reporter
07:39.660 - 07:42.300:  Enkechi Ogbonna in Lagos, Nigeria.
07:42.880 - 07:47.640:  So will the regional bloc's military chiefs recommend sending in troops to Niger?
07:48.600 - 07:53.360:  ECOWAS is already getting ready to move into Niger and what the military chiefs are doing here today
07:53.900 - 08:00.500:  is just to firm up the decisions that they've taken and tie the loose ends so that if the order is
08:00.500 - 08:04.440:  given for them to move in, they'll be able to quickly do that.
08:04.660 - 08:09.960:  Now it's just part of efforts to ramp up pressure on the junta to force them to come to the
08:09.960 - 08:16.320:  negotiating table and that does because in the past he's not yielded to the demand of ECOWAS
08:16.640 - 08:23.340:  or rejected both international and then efforts by religious leaders to mediate in the crisis.
08:23.760 - 08:29.360:  So ECOWAS is just trying to ensure that all the time there's constant reminder and pressure on
08:29.360 - 08:35.220:  the junta to retain their computer constitutional rule. Enkechi Ogbonna, you're in Lagos and of
08:35.220 - 08:42.120:  course Nigeria borders Niger, thinking about a potential deployment. What would that look like?
08:42.120 - 08:48.000:  Where would troops be recruited from? So the thing is previous missions like this have shown
08:48.760 - 08:56.280:  how troops are drawn from each member states under the umbrella ECOMOG, meaning ECOWAS monitoring
08:56.280 - 09:04.340:  group. We have seen that layout in Liberia and the Gambia in a couple of years ago and so it's
09:04.340 - 09:10.620:  expected that that would be the same formula that would be used for the deployment of troops and
09:10.620 - 09:17.080:  the formation of the squad that would be heading into Niger. Although at this time I recall
09:17.080 - 09:21.780:  this is the only country that has declared it would deploy about a thousand troops for the
09:21.780 - 09:26.440:  intervention plan should they decide to use the military route. However Senegal and Binary
09:26.440 - 09:32.140:  Public have also said they will also send and on a specified number of troops. But other countries
09:32.140 - 09:40.200:  like Nigeria and Togo and the likes are yet to to say what exactly their deployment plans would
09:40.200 - 09:47.020:  be. But is expected that a bordering states would have troops heading towards the states that
09:47.020 - 09:53.220:  border Nigeria and Niger or ground forces who are probably going to make any intervention.
09:53.900 - 09:58.600:  Now of course we talked about diplomacy and Enkechi talking there about logistics. Let's talk
09:58.600 - 10:04.180:  about public opinion though in the countries in which you both are. How do ordinary people feel
10:04.660 - 10:09.820:  about what's going on in Niger, Thomas and also a potential deployment? Because I know you've been
10:09.820 - 10:15.100:  speaking to some people. Yeah I think public opinion is very divided and in some of the countries
10:15.100 - 10:21.080:  that are going to take part in this particular intervention. In Ghana for instance the opposition
10:21.220 - 10:27.620:  is strongly against it and I spoke to some few people on the streets of Argentina. This is what
10:27.620 - 10:35.040:  they had to say. It's going to be going out to Senegal. I don't support the idea because
10:35.400 - 10:41.220:  it's rather going to bring challenges to us because we already have our programs. So let's
10:41.220 - 10:47.660:  rather concentrate on ourselves than going to fight someone's way. My idea is that going to war
10:47.660 - 10:54.100:  and spending money is rather going to bring economic challenges. So let's rather concentrate on
10:54.100 - 10:59.300:  ourselves and then mind our own business than going to fight someone's war. They should
10:59.640 - 11:05.040:  I think it's about time they all come together and say that she wasn't. It is not about war.
11:05.700 - 11:10.320:  It's about peace. That's what you want from Africa. So I don't agree that they should go and fight
11:10.320 - 11:16.760:  it. You've witnessed it. No. If it helps out, if it will be a greater good, why not? I don't think
11:16.760 - 11:21.480:  to be a problem. Interesting to hear Thomas some of those conflicting views there including the
11:21.480 - 11:27.640:  person who said we should mind our own business. Moving across Enkechi to where you are in Nigeria,
11:27.640 - 11:36.060:  what sense do you get about public opinion? Very similar to what's happening in Ghana. Nigerians
11:36.060 - 11:43.100:  are very divided on the issues that concern Nigerian first of. Part of the Israeli online community
11:43.140 - 11:50.160:  believes that Nigeria has enough problems. We have soaring inflation. We have an economic crisis.
11:50.160 - 11:56.000:  We have rising food prices and commodity prices. Everything is going to skyrocket and inflation
11:56.000 - 12:03.160:  is over 24 percent and people believe, look, we have bigger problems to deal with than Niger.
12:03.160 - 12:09.480:  Unfortunately, what has happened in Niger has happened. However, let Nigerians solve their problems.
12:10.400 - 12:16.780:  Enkechi Ogbana and Thomas Nadi talking about the crisis in Niger. Saudi officials have confirmed
12:16.780 - 12:22.580:  to the BBC that the British government has invited Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to visit the UK.
12:22.580 - 12:28.640:  It's understood that dates in October are being considered. Downing Street says Rishisunak
12:28.640 - 12:34.620:  spoken the phone to the Saudi leader, telling him he looked forward to meeting at the quote earliest
12:34.620 - 12:40.760:  opportunity. But the visit has been criticised by opposition parties and human rights groups who say
12:40.760 - 12:46.700:  the UK should not be welcoming a man with such a poor human rights record. Our security correspondent
12:46.700 - 12:52.120:  Frank Gardner reports. This, if it goes ahead, will be a highly controversial visit.
12:52.860 - 12:57.620:  The Saudi Crown Prince, still only in his late 30s, is credited with transforming Saudi
12:57.620 - 13:02.040:  society for the better. He scrapped the ban on women driving and he's brought back public
13:02.040 - 13:07.500:  entertainment, long banned by the religious clerics. He's also investing Saudi Arabia's massive
13:07.500 - 13:12.880:  oil wealth in diversifying the economy away from petric chemicals. It's some of this trillion
13:12.880 - 13:17.980:  dollar plus fortune that 10 Dining Street would like to see come to Britain. But the Crown Prince,
13:17.980 - 13:22.800:  who effectively rules his country unchallenged, has been something of a pariah in many Western
13:22.800 - 13:28.520:  capitals for the past five years. He's widely suspected of ordering the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,
13:28.980 - 13:34.560:  a Saudi journalist critical of his policies, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
13:35.540 - 13:40.240:  The Prince denies any involvement, but human rights activists, including the Chief Executive
13:40.240 - 13:45.220:  of Amnesty International, Sasha Deshmukh, firmly believe he should not be invited to Britain.
13:45.540 - 13:50.580:  I would be very worried by an invitation for a visit where it appears that the UK government
13:50.580 - 13:56.100:  is sending a clear message that UK leadership on human rights, which is something that we should
13:56.100 - 14:01.400:  be proud of, is now taking a back seat. A statement released by Number 10 today,
14:01.400 - 14:06.900:  talked in glowing terms about Anglo-Saudi cooperation in defence, security and cutting-edge
14:06.900 - 14:12.640:  technology, yet made no mention of human rights. But Labour's deputy leader Angela Reiner said it
14:12.640 - 14:17.180:  was essential these would discuss during the Crown Prince's visit, and the dialogue between the
14:17.180 - 14:23.500:  two nations continued. Frank Gardner, last year, the UN's annual climate conference was held in
14:23.500 - 14:30.360:  the Egyptian Red Sea Resort of Shamil's Shake. The exquisite multi-colored coral reefs and dazzlingly
14:30.360 - 14:35.940:  beautiful marine life in the crystal clear waters of the sea, a perfect reminder of what's at stake
14:35.940 - 14:41.720:  if world leaders failed to protect the environment. Now Israel's environment ministry has said that
14:41.720 - 14:47.820:  the Red Sea is warming more than twice as fast as the global average, posing a threat to this
14:47.820 - 14:56.140:  underwater paradise. On Middle East analyst Mike Thompson told me more. 1200 species of fish down
14:56.140 - 15:03.500:  there in the Red Sea, and that includes 44 different species of sharks and 200 different types of
15:03.500 - 15:08.980:  coral, and this is partly because the waters are very clear compared to many oceans, and the
15:08.980 - 15:14.840:  sunlight's able to penetrate, and that gives an abundance of splendid sea life. But now there's
15:14.840 - 15:19.940:  this warning that all this splendid sea life is under threat. Why do scientists think that this
15:19.940 - 15:26.280:  particular sea is warming so fast? Well, one of the reasons is that it's enclosed by some very hot
15:26.680 - 15:31.060:  areas of land right around it in the Gulf, but even more importantly, it's quite shallow,
15:31.720 - 15:35.980:  and that means it can heat up much more than say the Caribbean, which is very hot,
15:35.980 - 15:40.740:  but the ocean's about 10 times deeper. So that's fundamentally it, and of course there is
15:40.740 - 15:46.920:  like elsewhere, sadly pollution is a factor. So how much of a threat is all this given that the
15:46.920 - 15:52.800:  coral in the Red Sea has up until now held up pretty well to climate change compared to coral
15:52.800 - 15:58.340:  elsewhere? It has, yes. I mean, one of the factors here, it seems that scientists believe that
15:58.340 - 16:03.020:  the algae that's there has actually come from the Indian ocean thousands of years ago,
16:03.540 - 16:11.280:  so it had to pass through some very hot seas. So only the most resilient managed to then survive
16:11.280 - 16:16.360:  when they were in the north of the Red Sea, and so for that reason it's being able to survive
16:16.360 - 16:24.440:  better than others, but growing temperatures, rising pollution is a big problem, and also we've
16:24.440 - 16:30.740:  seen the sea turtle population has been declining, and the sea turtles they help to balance the
16:30.740 - 16:35.580:  coral and algae within the ecosystem, and that's really quite vital. They've been suffering from
16:35.580 - 16:41.120:  a disease, and all of these factors combined mean despite the resilience of this algae,
16:41.640 - 16:47.500:  we could see a lot of it going, and already around 20 percent in some areas has been badly damaged.

17:01.820 - 17:08.620:  keep is my home, here is everything I made in 17 years, I lived, like all my friends, my family,

18:25.760 - 18:32.640:  taking legal action against one of the country's most popular broadcasters. They say pink TV is using
18:32.640 - 18:37.220:  artificial intelligence to alter video clips of their television appearances.
18:37.220 - 18:44.080:  Here's our Balkans correspondent, Guy Deloni. Pink TV is well known for its pro-government stance,
18:44.080 - 18:49.540:  so it's no stranger to the mockery of opposition figures. But now it's deploying artificial
18:49.540 - 18:55.460:  intelligence to create video clips in which the opposition leaders mock themselves. A casual
18:55.460 - 18:59.740:  viewer would find it hard to tell that the soundtrack to the original clips has been replaced,
18:59.740 - 19:04.900:  and the opposition say that's unacceptable. The leader of the party of freedom and justice,
19:04.900 - 19:10.940:  Dragon Gelas, is starting legal action against pink TV. He warns that AI manipulation could have
19:10.940 - 19:16.760:  catastrophic consequences. Pink's management insisted the clips are satirical and a humorous
19:16.760 - 19:23.040:  depiction of Serbian reality. Guy Deloni, at this time of year, millions of young people around the
19:23.040 - 19:28.840:  world are preparing to start university. It can be a challenging time. But in Ukraine, students
19:28.840 - 19:34.340:  are having to grapple with problems that could potentially decide whether they live or die.
19:34.940 - 19:40.880:  Ron Keeve, Toby Luckhurst reports. It's been a tough and unusual few years to be a university
19:40.880 - 19:46.760:  student here in Ukraine. There are some students that never attended university offline,
19:46.760 - 19:53.340:  because they were accepted when the COVID was and sent for scale inventions, so they never really
19:53.340 - 20:00.140:  was in class offline. I meet this group of undergraduates outside Keeve,
20:00.140 - 20:04.660:  Mahila Academy, a university here in the Ukrainian capital. They're standing outside the
20:04.660 - 20:09.200:  admissions office, helping people who are applying for a spot before term starts in September.
20:11.700 - 20:16.560:  This is a welcome video for new students. There's no mention of war. It's like a standard
20:16.560 - 20:21.040:  welcome video at any other university in the world. The Keeve, Mahila president is telling students
20:21.040 - 20:25.680:  about the community and all the opportunity students can have here. But like all things now
20:25.680 - 20:29.720:  in Ukraine, the war has raised unique challenges for the country's university students.
20:30.420 - 20:36.760:  Nastya is a student originally from Laviv. The parents of male students, they're mostly
20:37.160 - 20:41.280:  willing, they're a children to stay abroad so as not to be mobilized, because they're like
20:41.280 - 20:47.520:  upcoming to be 18 and they could be recruited to army. Under current laws brought in after
20:47.520 - 20:54.200:  Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, men aged between 18 and 60 can't cross the country's borders
20:54.200 - 20:59.060:  without special permission from the government. That means male students who decide to study at
20:59.060 - 21:04.400:  home in Ukraine can't go abroad. And those who go study abroad won't be able to come back home
21:04.400 - 21:10.180:  to visit without risking getting stuck inside the country. I just got accepted to Keeve,
21:10.180 - 21:16.080:  Mahila Academy. I live in Keeve and I'm not planning to go anywhere. I haven't left country since
21:16.080 - 21:21.560:  the war started and I don't want to. Misha is a 17-year-old from Keeve who's starting at Keeve,
21:21.560 - 21:26.060:  Mahila in September. He's thought about studying abroad and escaping Ukraine completely,
21:26.540 - 21:30.260:  but the risk of getting trapped on the other side of the border and unable to see his family
21:30.260 - 21:35.820:  made him think twice. I don't want to go anywhere. Keeve is my home. Here is everything I made in
21:35.820 - 21:42.820:  17 years. I lived like all my friends, my family, everything. Today, Ukraine students are protected
21:42.820 - 21:47.380:  from the military draft. That means while they're studying, men here won't be called up to fight,
21:47.380 - 21:52.800:  but that could change and deciding to study at home means taking that risk. My parents were
21:52.800 - 21:59.380:  pressuring me so hard to go somewhere because I might get drafted to harm me, I might get killed by
21:59.380 - 22:04.220:  rocket. He turns 18 next year, but doesn't plan to leave before then. And he's optimistic about
22:04.220 - 22:10.160:  Ukraine's future and keen to help get the country back on its feet. Russia is showing no sign of
22:10.160 - 22:13.960:  halting its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and with termed you to start here at Keeve Mahila,
22:13.960 - 22:18.160:  it's just a couple of weeks time. Students and rolling in today have no clue what could happen
22:18.220 - 22:22.840:  during their degrees and what kind of country they'll be graduating into in just a few years time.
22:23.880 - 22:30.080:  That report by Toby Luckhurst in Kiev. It's more than 100 days since US film and television
22:30.080 - 22:35.640:  writers went on strike and there are signs that a deal may be close. Their union is currently
22:35.640 - 22:41.360:  considering a new offer from the major studios. The screenwriters were joined by members of the
22:41.360 - 22:48.520:  American actors Guilds sag after last month. The action has resulted in a serious halting of
22:48.520 - 22:54.600:  major Hollywood productions. David Wettel is a TV writer and producer who's worked on a wide
22:54.600 - 23:01.120:  range of series including Star Trek, Deep Space Nine, Battle Star Galactica and CSI Crime Scene
23:01.920 - 23:06.780:  investigation. He's now also a strike coordinator for union members at Sony Studios.
23:07.580 - 23:12.720:  Simon Jack asked him why he felt optimistic that studio executives were finally
23:12.720 - 23:20.000:  willing to cut a deal now. My sense of it is they are circling, they would like to make a deal,
23:20.000 - 23:23.880:  they want to see if they can beat us down a little bit first, that gives us a ground,
23:23.880 - 23:30.260:  but ultimately I think my sense is in the next month to two months there will be a deal in place.
23:30.560 - 23:35.700:  What are the key demands that the writers have here? What do they need to secure?
23:35.700 - 23:42.080:  As writers we give up our copyright to our material in exchange for residuals which is a profit
23:42.080 - 23:47.400:  sharing agreement with the studios that we who create the original product that they then
23:47.400 - 23:52.380:  market all over the world that we share in the revenue from that because we created it.
23:52.760 - 23:58.200:  Since the streaming era they have managed to crank down the faucet till it's only a dribble
23:58.780 - 24:05.400:  and we writers depend on those residuals when we're in between shows because we are
24:05.440 - 24:09.540:  itinerant workers that move from job to job like people that work the harvests.
24:10.420 - 24:15.120:  They have refused to pay us our fair share decent residuals for streaming,
24:15.140 - 24:21.260:  refused to even show us the number of views that they are getting for their streaming material
24:21.260 - 24:26.380:  and that's put our income at jeopardy. All of us are stressed or trying to make ends meet.
24:27.640 - 24:32.440:  It's been widely reported there's a sort of AI artificial intelligence element in this.
24:32.440 - 24:36.180:  What's the fear there and what kind of reassurances are you looking for?
24:36.280 - 24:41.400:  They're not going to have a robot write TV. They know even the people in Charges conglomerates
24:41.400 - 24:47.040:  that understand TV business know that much. But they think why not bring in a robot to take
24:47.040 - 24:53.320:  all the notes to write even like assemble plots and develop outlines that then the showrunners
24:53.320 - 24:59.480:  in the number two can rewrite. Well that eliminates again younger writers and then how are you going
24:59.480 - 25:05.400:  to have showrunners in number two that twos that even understand the business if they never had
25:05.400 - 25:10.860:  that training if a robot did it. How important has the supportive access been hugely important?
25:10.860 - 25:16.760:  It was a checkmate. It was a waterloo moment. They had a grand strategy and it blew up in their
25:16.760 - 25:22.840:  faces and it's been extremely important. It was now all productions shut down throughout the
25:22.840 - 25:29.340:  American entertainment business and they are facing a complete shut off of new product and now
25:29.340 - 25:35.780:  they're in trouble and now they finally realized it. So the actors gave us the cloud to go back
25:35.780 - 25:41.540:  to them and get a strong contract which in turn will then help the actors. Content is everything
25:41.540 - 25:46.980:  isn't it? Once you start emptying the bucket of what's available on the various streaming platforms
25:47.060 - 25:51.360:  that is terrifying to the streamers themselves because they know that without new content
25:51.360 - 25:55.940:  people will go elsewhere. It's beginning to dawn on them. Yes I mean I know many people
25:55.940 - 26:01.140:  friends who are not in the business who tell me they're cancelling apps right? Not only because
26:01.140 - 26:05.760:  these conglomerates are charging more because there's nothing new. There's nothing new they want
26:05.760 - 26:11.880:  to watch and just as in 2007 the studios pretended they were unconcerned. Oh well just do reality
26:11.880 - 26:17.560:  television. It's cheaper anyway and people love reality television. They don't care about drama
26:17.560 - 26:23.180:  which is too expensive. They talk themselves into this and every 15 years we have to reeducate a
26:23.180 - 26:29.040:  new generation of studio executives who think that they don't need us and then they have to find out
26:29.040 - 26:34.080:  that they do and then they lose their appetite for this kind of strike to happen at least for another
26:34.080 - 26:41.760:  15 year. TV writer David Weddle. During election campaigns politicians often draw on popular music
26:41.760 - 26:47.140:  as a way of getting their message across and to engage potential voters but it can cause problems
26:47.140 - 26:53.140:  when musicians object to their songs being used to promote political views they strongly disagree
26:53.140 - 26:59.980:  with. Narrodges is the latest musician to make such a complaint about his hit song We Are Family.
26:59.980 - 27:07.000:  The American had told a far-right political party in Switzerland to stop using a track which has
27:07.000 - 27:23.640:  a very similar chorus to the 70s disco classic Chantal Hartle reports. Recorded by Sister
27:23.640 - 27:30.120:  Sledge in 1979 we are family went on to become a huge hit around the world. The song celebrates
27:30.120 - 27:35.580:  the sister's family bond and is used in popular culture more generally to express solidarity
27:36.340 - 27:38.040:  so when Narrodges heard this
27:49.100 - 27:54.400:  he made it clear he wasn't happy with Swiss people's party or the SVP as it's known
27:54.400 - 27:59.960:  and its election campaign video which shows party members wearing brightly coloured sunglasses
28:00.680 - 28:06.680:  dancing and waving glow sticks in a nightclub. The SVP is the biggest party in Switzerland's
28:06.680 - 28:11.900:  coalition government and is known for its anti-immigration policies and Eurosceptic views.
28:11.940 - 28:18.000:  In a statement Roger said his song was intended to be about diversity and inclusion and that he
28:18.000 - 28:25.000:  condemned its use by the Swiss party or anyone who didn't share those values. SVP politician Thomas
28:25.000 - 28:31.180:  Mattur who's credited as the songwriter under the name DJ Tommy said the anthem was an original
28:31.180 - 28:37.460:  composition but Swiss media have reported that for years Mr Mattur's mobile phone ringtone
28:37.460 - 28:44.360:  has been We Are Family. This issue has repeatedly come up in the US during Donald Trump's election
28:44.360 - 28:49.480:  rallies. The former president has angered a long list of musicians including Elton John,
28:49.480 - 28:55.000:  the Rolling Stones and Credence Clearball to Revival who've all opposed the use of their music
28:55.000 - 29:02.320:  for political reasons. Some have threatened legal action and in 2017 the American rapper Eminem won a
29:02.320 - 29:09.780:  $600,000 copyright lawsuit after the New Zealand National Party used his song. A court ruled that
29:09.780 - 29:14.860:  the National Party's election advert was sufficiently similar to Eminem's track.
29:20.380 - 29:24.640:  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
