00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.660:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.480 - 00:24.160:  I'm Andrew Peach, and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday 10 August, these are our main stories.
00:24.220 - 00:29.640:  Ukraine has told vulnerable people in an area close to Russian front lines to leave immediately
00:29.640 - 00:34.180:  because of an increase in Russian attacks. The leaders of the Kuwaiti Niger announced
00:34.180 - 00:39.240:  a new government as West African countries consider military intervention, and an Ecuadorian
00:39.240 - 00:43.400:  presidential candidate is assassinated just two weeks before the polls open.
00:46.160 - 00:51.400:  Also in this podcast, I understand that they won't put him away for life.
00:51.820 - 00:56.900:  It's hard for me.
00:57.420 - 01:01.660:  While people in Russia say they're living in fear as former Wagner troops return home.
01:06.460 - 01:10.340:  The Ukrainian authorities have issued a mandatory evacuation order around the city of
01:10.340 - 01:15.520:  Copians, concerning areas in the Harkiv region due to what they say is intense Russian shelling.
01:16.040 - 01:20.880:  Earlier, a Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed successes in the region.
01:23.160 - 01:28.460:  In the Copiansk region, assault troops have made advances along the front line during offensive
01:28.460 - 01:35.060:  operations. During the day, counter-attacks by the armed forces of Ukraine were successfully
01:35.060 - 01:39.520:  repelled in the Lugansk People's Republic and in the Harkiv region.
01:40.040 - 01:44.560:  Ukraine's military said the situation around Copiansk was difficult but under control.
01:44.560 - 01:49.260:  Copiansk was one of several cities and towns in Ukraine recaptured last September.
01:49.720 - 01:53.440:  In recent weeks, Russia has been trying to take the cities and towns again.
01:53.440 - 01:57.380:  Our correspondent, Hugo Bachega, is just back from Ukraine and told me more.
01:57.680 - 02:01.620:  It's interesting because over the last few weeks and months we've been talking about the
02:01.620 - 02:07.820:  counter-offensive in the east of the country, in Donyashk, also in the Zapodizia region of Ukraine.
02:07.820 - 02:13.240:  But this is happening in the northeast of the country. So perhaps far away from those areas where
02:13.240 - 02:18.060:  the Ukrainians are trying to make some gains, this is happening in the Harkiv region.
02:18.160 - 02:22.640:  And the Ukrainians are saying that this is now the main direction of the Russian offensive.
02:22.640 - 02:28.760:  So they're trying to make some gains there in the Copiansk region of Ukraine.
02:28.820 - 02:35.980:  And now we're having this announcement of a mandatory evacuation in 37 settlements in this
02:36.060 - 02:42.600:  part of the country. And what we're seeing is that we've seen reports in recent days
02:42.600 - 02:50.300:  suggesting that fighting has intensified in this area. And I think today the message from the
02:50.300 - 02:56.600:  local authorities making this announcement said that Russia has been shelling this area for
02:57.040 - 03:02.340:  almost every day and they're trying to advance in this direction. And I think what is interesting
03:02.340 - 03:09.980:  is that the Deputy Defence Minister in Ukraine earlier this week said that Russian forces had formed
03:09.980 - 03:16.380:  a large group that is now attempting to break through Ukrainian defenses in that part of the
03:16.380 - 03:21.060:  country. And people talking about tens of thousands of Russian forces now in that part of the
03:21.060 - 03:25.940:  country. Something we're going to hear more about I suspect. And also Ukraine's navy wants a
03:25.940 - 03:32.280:  humanitarian corridor to get its ships out of ports where they've been trapped for a long time
03:32.280 - 03:37.300:  now back into the Black Sea. How will that work? That's a very good question. So the announcement
03:37.300 - 03:42.900:  was made today by the Ukrainian authorities that this humanitarian corridor is going to be
03:42.900 - 03:50.920:  created to let dozens of ships there are now trapped in Ukrainian ports to sail into the Black Sea.
03:50.920 - 03:59.500:  Obviously this is perhaps the way that the Ukrainians have come up with to let these ships sail
03:59.500 - 04:04.680:  into the Black Sea after the collapse of the grain deal. So we don't know how this is going to
04:04.680 - 04:09.700:  work. We haven't had any kind of reaction from Moscow. Obviously Russia has been saying that any
04:09.700 - 04:17.600:  ship could be considered a military target in that part of the world. What the Ukrainers are saying
04:17.600 - 04:22.380:  is that they're going to put cameras on the ships to show that this is a humanitarian mission with
04:22.380 - 04:26.600:  no military purpose. But we don't know how this is going to work. Here you go, Bashar, who's just
04:26.600 - 04:31.760:  back from Ukraine. Two weeks after the coup that toppled Niger's president, Mohamed Bazoum,
04:31.960 - 04:36.640:  the regional grouping of West African countries, Echoos, hasn't yet said how it intends to resolve
04:36.640 - 04:42.260:  the crisis. Today, Echoos leaders are meeting in Nigeria's capital Abuja to talk about whether to
04:42.260 - 04:47.680:  seek a diplomatic solution or take military action. There's also been concern expressed by the US,
04:47.680 - 04:52.380:  France and the UN Secretary General about the health of the former president who's being held
04:52.380 - 04:57.860:  by the coup leaders. Africa, editor Andrew Harding told me more about the divide within Echoos.
04:58.360 - 05:06.000:  Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, Burundi, Senegal, key players in an organization, a grouping that had,
05:06.640 - 05:12.620:  at some stage, been able to intervene militarily in a number of countries. But these days, it's
05:12.620 - 05:18.880:  a lot more complicated. And it's, I think, far from clear whether they're initial threats to use
05:18.880 - 05:25.580:  military force in Niger to restore democracy can be followed through. It couldn't happen without
05:25.580 - 05:33.420:  Nigeria's endorsement. And right now, Nigeria has problems of its own priorities of its own,
05:33.420 - 05:39.460:  and there is a sense, I think, a growing sense, that people in Nigeria and in other countries
05:40.120 - 05:47.060:  want to give negotiations, diplomacy and economic sanctions a bit more of a chance to work,
05:47.060 - 05:53.320:  to see if they can cut some sort of deal with the coup leaders in Niger to edge them towards
05:53.320 - 06:00.080:  some sort of promise of a transition. Certainly no sign thus far, two weeks into this coup that
06:00.080 - 06:05.320:  the military are going to stand down. They've even announced a new cabinet today. That's right.
06:05.320 - 06:11.600:  Very much forging ahead, if you like, and clearly the timing meant to send that message to these
06:11.600 - 06:17.500:  regional leaders meeting across the border. They've also perhaps been turning up the screws
06:17.500 - 06:24.440:  by continuing to keep the president. You mentioned President Basum, who's in essentially being
06:24.440 - 06:30.720:  held hostage at his presidential compound in Niyama, in Niger's capital, and growing reports
06:30.720 - 06:35.900:  of concern from the Americans and others about the conditions in which the president and his
06:35.900 - 06:43.100:  family are being kept. And concerns too about the possibility, at least in the future at some
06:43.100 - 06:50.840:  point, that Russia might try to exploit this period of instability by sending in Wagner mercenaries
06:50.840 - 06:55.280:  as they've done with some success in neighboring Mali and elsewhere.
06:55.280 - 07:01.660:  Our Africa editor, Andrew Harding. The Ecuadorian president, Guillermo Lasso, has said the country's
07:01.660 - 07:06.220:  presidential election will go ahead as planned this month after a candidate was shot dead
07:06.220 - 07:11.920:  at an event in the capital Keto. Fernando Vivicensio was killed in a burst of gunfire as he was
07:11.920 - 07:17.760:  getting into his car. A state of emergency is now in force. Mr. Vivicensio's friend Dr. Carlos
07:17.760 - 07:28.120:  Figueroa described how he found out about the death. I was assisting two patients that arrived
07:28.120 - 07:33.580:  injured. I thought Fernando made it out, but when I went to the clinic to help injured patients,
07:34.280 - 07:40.000:  I entered the emergency room, and I saw Fernando was dead. He didn't have vital signs.
07:41.700 - 07:45.840:  Alas and America editor is Vanessa Bushluter. Carlos, from whom we've just been hearing
07:45.840 - 07:52.580:  there, described the scene of the murder. He and Fernando Vivicensio left a campaign event
07:52.600 - 08:00.320:  at 6.20 in the afternoon in the capital Keto. This campaign event in the center of Keto in the
08:00.320 - 08:07.820:  financial district held at a previous building that had been a school previously, had run very
08:07.820 - 08:14.040:  well. He'd shaken hands with voters, and 30 seconds after he left the building, there was a
08:14.040 - 08:22.900:  hail of bullets. Fernando Vivicensio received three bullets to the head and died, and nine people
08:22.900 - 08:27.760:  were also injured in this horrific attack. Where's the idea who might be behind this?
08:28.440 - 08:34.800:  Yes. A gang calling themselves Los Lobos, the wolves, has claimed responsibility for this killing.
08:34.800 - 08:41.280:  They released a video in which they wave around their rifles and threaten other politicians.
08:42.320 - 08:48.800:  This is a surprising development because I think most people in Ecuador, including myself,
08:48.800 - 08:55.260:  had thought that a different gang called Los Choneros was behind this killing because Los Choneros
08:55.260 - 09:02.080:  had threatened Fernando Vivicensio just last week. They had threatened his life, and Fernando
09:02.080 - 09:09.020:  Vivicensio had been giving a security detail, but that security detail was not able to save
09:09.020 - 09:14.020:  his life when he was attacked last night. And in terms of the state of emergency, what does that
09:14.020 - 09:19.500:  mean for the conduct of the election that obviously is ongoing? There were some voices in Ecuador
09:19.500 - 09:24.960:  which questioned whether the election maybe should be put on hold or delayed, but it is going ahead,
09:25.020 - 09:33.020:  and many are actually quoting Fernando Vivicensio himself who said just weeks ago when a different
09:33.020 - 09:39.060:  politician, a local mayor was killed, he said that people should not be cowed, that democracy
09:39.060 - 09:45.560:  should continue. So I think in his honor, the elections will go ahead. And of course, it is a,
09:46.020 - 09:50.340:  you know, important exercise in democracy to hold this presidential election.
09:50.640 - 09:55.700:  I'll ask an America editor Vanessa Bushluter. In Hawaii, the number of deaths resulting from wild
09:55.700 - 10:01.800:  fires on Maui Island has risen to 36. The worst affected area is the popular results that
10:01.800 - 10:06.400:  he have Lahaina, which has been almost totally burnt to the ground. Mason Jarvey, who suffered
10:06.400 - 10:10.360:  burns fleeing the fire in Lahaina, said the situation there was devastating.
10:11.060 - 10:18.360:  I resident of Lahaina for about 18 years, and we just have the worst disaster I've ever seen.
10:18.940 - 10:28.540:  All line is burnt to crisp and it's like on fog lips. Over 2000 people have been displaced to
10:28.540 - 10:33.860:  move to special shelters or hotels. Bob Fenton of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
10:33.860 - 10:40.200:  urged people to be cautious. You're still fire going on, life's being saved, so please follow
10:40.200 - 10:46.660:  your local officials, listen to their message and make sure you're safe, make sure you have a plan,
10:46.660 - 10:50.520:  make sure that if you have questions, you're working with your local officials.
10:51.080 - 10:54.280:  To find out more, I spoke to CBS correspondent Jared Hill.
10:54.740 - 10:59.240:  One of the things, Andrew, that we know here is that because of the conditions on the ground,
10:59.280 - 11:04.360:  it had been difficult for officials, really, to get through a significant portion of the island
11:04.360 - 11:09.960:  of Maui, to be able to tell exactly who was unaccounted for because they were sheltering in a
11:09.960 - 11:15.540:  car or a hotel without access to a phone to tell people, or if they had, in fact, died.
11:15.540 - 11:20.640:  And while we don't know the circumstances around any of these deaths at this point, again,
11:20.640 - 11:25.100:  it does appear that as they're able to get more onto the island, they're learning more about
11:25.100 - 11:29.500:  just the level of destruction here. What do we know about what's happening in
11:29.500 - 11:35.220:  Hawaii now? It's nighttime on the islands, of course, and the authorities continue to do their
11:35.220 - 11:39.060:  work in the wake of what's happened. Yeah, so there are kind of two things that are happening.
11:39.060 - 11:43.900:  Here, one, there are the efforts to continue putting out these fires, which had been
11:43.900 - 11:48.200:  raging really on that island for hours there. So there's the fire suppression effort,
11:48.200 - 11:52.280:  but then there is also this search and rescue mission that is continuing to happen. Again,
11:52.280 - 11:59.140:  trying to see where people might be and get folks to safety. There's also an effort here to
11:59.140 - 12:03.520:  make sure that the people who have been able to evacuate the island of Maui have somewhere to go.
12:03.740 - 12:07.780:  There are shelters that have been set up on some of the neighboring islands. There are also efforts
12:07.780 - 12:14.480:  to get people on planes to be able to fly out so that they can worry as little as possible about
12:14.980 - 12:19.300:  people that might be on the island and just try and focus on getting the fire out and
12:19.300 - 12:22.500:  making sure that it's safe for anyone to return it a later date.
12:22.700 - 12:26.960:  And the last thing we need is more communities affected. What's the weather forecast in terms of
12:27.260 - 12:31.340:  controlling the fire versus the possibility of more fires breaking out or spreading?
12:32.440 - 12:36.440:  Right, so the winds have died down significantly from the peak of this. Remember,
12:36.440 - 12:41.380:  this is all related largely to a hurricane. They didn't actually touch the island of Maui,
12:41.380 - 12:45.400:  but the winds helped to fuel some of these flames. Those winds have died down, which have allowed
12:45.400 - 12:51.400:  for the crews there to continue with their fire suppression, getting helicopters in the air to
12:51.400 - 12:55.900:  doubt some of these fires with water. That'll continue for as long as it takes.
12:56.680 - 13:02.160:  CBS correspondent Jared Hill, the Wagner group of Russian mercenaries has now ended its
13:02.160 - 13:06.620:  deployment in Ukraine. And that means many of the fighters it recruited from prisons,
13:06.620 - 13:13.140:  including murderers, are now free. But as Arseny Sokolov reports, not everyone is ready to welcome them.
13:16.100 - 13:22.260:  A village hole in southern Russia, a young woman in a crazily potent pink and blue jumpsuit
13:22.260 - 13:26.660:  with waist-length brown hair is dancing with a group of excited children.
13:30.140 - 13:35.400:  Organising parties and games for young people is 19-year-old Tatiana Mastika's first job,
13:36.020 - 13:44.140:  and she loves it. But hours after one event like this back in April, Tatiana was murdered.
13:44.700 - 13:48.740:  By a gang whose alleged ring-leaders should have been safely behind bars,
13:48.740 - 13:55.060:  serving time for another murder. But he had been let out years early to fight in Ukraine,
13:55.680 - 13:57.220:  let out and pardoned.
13:57.280 - 14:01.620:  The current military company is called Zanacchiva-Kabagna.
14:01.860 - 14:07.320:  Thanks to this man, Yevgeny Prigorzyn found out the mercenary company Wagner.
14:08.440 - 14:14.180:  He taught prisons to recruit tens of thousands of convicted murderers, rapists, and robbers.
14:16.840 - 14:20.060:  They were used to kill Ukrainians in the bloodiest battles of the war,
14:20.100 - 14:25.780:  and many of them lost their lives too. But those who survived have now left Wagner,
14:26.240 - 14:31.680:  and are walking the streets of Russia again. And in some cases already committing new crimes.
14:34.040 - 14:40.800:  How could you raise your hand against the child, someone who wasn't threatening you in any way,
14:40.800 - 14:47.180:  a child who had just started to leave, for whom all doors were open?
14:55.660 - 15:01.080:  Chupko were found buried in Woodland, in the Krasnodar region, in early May.
15:01.420 - 15:05.220:  Three suspects have been arrested in connection with the killing. One of them,
15:05.220 - 15:12.040:  Zemyanki Varkant, who denies any wrongdoing had already been serving an 18-year sentence for
15:12.040 - 15:17.280:  crimes including murder. But he was released after only six years to fight in Ukraine.
15:18.000 - 15:23.000:  Then, like other criminal recruits, he was free to go home with a pardon.
15:25.660 - 15:30.440:  Destroy your attention to the word pardon. That's not the same as Amnesty.
15:30.840 - 15:34.840:  Olga Romanova is the founder of Russia Behind Bus, an organization
15:34.840 - 15:42.700:  campaigning for prison reform. A pardon is given to an individual, personally,
15:42.700 - 15:48.720:  by the president himself, and the law says it comes after reconciliation with a victim
15:48.720 - 15:54.800:  and a good report from prison. None of this happens when Wagner criminals are pardoned.
15:55.260 - 15:58.800:  But even so, they can restart their lives with a clean slate.
15:59.300 - 16:01.900:  Indeed, they are officially regarded as heroes.
16:02.680 - 16:06.620:  At least 20 serious crimes by former Wagner convicts have been reported.
16:07.220 - 16:12.580:  Murders, rapes, grievous bodily harm. But the real number may be greater,
16:13.200 - 16:17.880:  because it's now illegal in Russia to discredit anyone involved in what's officially
16:17.880 - 16:23.860:  called the special military operation. That law could in theory even be used against the police
16:23.860 - 16:24.400:  themselves.
16:31.060 - 16:35.880:  Lach numbers of mourners attended the funeral of the children's entertainer Skirilchupko
16:35.880 - 16:40.540:  and Tatiana Mastika. And since then, tens of thousands of people in
16:40.540 - 16:45.880:  Krasnodar have signed a petition to demand that the chief suspect, Demyan Kivarkan,
16:46.220 - 16:49.120:  gets a life sentence if he is convicted of the murders.
16:49.980 - 16:54.020:  But Tatiana's mother, Nadiazda, doesn't think it will have much effect.
16:56.180 - 17:00.180:  Of course, I understand who was responsible for my daughter's death,
17:00.760 - 17:04.820:  and I know he had a previous conviction. I'm not stupid.
17:06.100 - 17:09.760:  I understand that they won't put him away for life.
17:10.240 - 17:15.300:  That's hard for me.
17:16.940 - 17:17.320:  Sorry.
17:18.660 - 17:24.880:  In today's Russia, she thinks, the victims of so-called heroes can't expect real justice.
17:26.040 - 17:27.300:  Us any soccer love reporting.
17:30.300 - 17:34.380:  Still to come in this podcast, an announcement for Tatiana Swift fans as the US
17:34.380 - 17:37.160:  states on her record-breaking tour come to an end.
17:45.240 - 17:50.080:  In the US, a man who made violent threats against President Biden has been shot dead by the FBI
17:50.080 - 17:54.820:  in Utah. The shooting happened while agents were attempting to serve him with an arrest warrant,
17:54.820 - 17:59.520:  just hours before Mr. Biden's planned visit to the state. Our correspondent in Washington
17:59.520 - 18:00.580:  is Nomiya Ikbar.
18:00.900 - 18:05.620:  The suspect's name was Craig Robertson. We understand he was 75 years old,
18:06.060 - 18:10.780:  and there was a criminal complaint that had already been filed in the district court of Utah
18:11.480 - 18:18.740:  regarding serious concerns about him. One of the charges that he was facing was threats against
18:18.740 - 18:23.800:  President. I've got the criminal complaint in front of me, but FBI agents conducted a surveillance
18:23.800 - 18:28.380:  of his home back in March. They wanted to talk to him about his social media posts. He told
18:28.380 - 18:31.580:  them, according to the complaint, to come back with an arrest warrant, which they did.
18:32.400 - 18:37.480:  Now, when you look at the criminal complaint and the evidence that they had compiled against him
18:37.480 - 18:42.720:  included social media posts that he'd put up, and they're very dark messages. They show violence
18:42.720 - 18:48.100:  towards President Biden and other notable Democrats, also glorifying guns. One particular post,
18:48.100 - 18:53.280:  which worried agents and that there's been cited in the criminal complaint is when he posted,
18:53.280 - 18:59.820:  I hear Biden is coming to Utah, cleaning the dust of the M24 sniper rifle, welcome
18:59.820 - 19:06.440:  buffoon in chief. Now, we haven't been given any details on exactly what led to the shooting,
19:06.440 - 19:10.680:  although our part of the station's CBS says law enforcement sources told them that there was
19:10.680 - 19:15.980:  a gunfire of some sort. And the FBI told the BBC in a statement that they're following their
19:15.980 - 19:21.760:  policy, which is to now refer the case to the agency for a review. Nomeo, in Washington,
19:22.520 - 19:27.260:  the World Bank has suspended new loans to Uganda in the wake of a tough new law against same
19:27.260 - 19:31.820:  sex relations. There's already been a negative reaction on the markets with the Ugandan
19:31.820 - 19:37.340:  shilling weakening sharply after the announcement. My colleague Divina Gupta spoke to Fabrice O'Dar,
19:37.340 - 19:43.100:  an advisor with Open for Business, a coalition of leading global companies dedicated to LGBT inclusion,
19:43.460 - 19:48.000:  formerly of the World Bank. He explains how significant this decision is for Uganda.
19:48.660 - 19:54.920:  The budget of the Ugandan government is very reliant on external aid. And in fact,
19:55.820 - 20:01.600:  the budget of the government is about 13 or 14 billion dollars. And you could say that one
20:01.600 - 20:06.800:  billion dollar usually comes from the World Bank. But there's another aspect to it, which is that
20:06.800 - 20:13.460:  the budget of the Ugandan government is also dependent on boring from various sources.
20:14.020 - 20:21.400:  Is this sort of intervention by the World Bank enough for the government in Uganda to reconsider
20:21.400 - 20:27.360:  their decision? On the side of the World Bank, the objective is not so much for the Ugandan
20:27.360 - 20:33.940:  government to reconsider the anti-omosexuality act. It is to say, well, look, it's impossible for us
20:33.940 - 20:41.120:  to have effective development project if you intentionally bar an entire segment of your population
20:41.120 - 20:46.760:  from benefiting from development efforts. But in effect, then a lot of questions have been asked,
20:46.760 - 20:52.300:  especially by listeners as well, whether this sort of ends up being counterproductive and hurting
20:52.300 - 20:59.580:  locals in Uganda. That's a very legitimate question, which is, ultimately, the poorest in Uganda
21:00.380 - 21:07.220:  are the victims of the political manipulation of LGBTQ plus people by President Musevini.
21:07.900 - 21:15.120:  But ultimately, the World Bank, if it wants to respect its policies, cannot land to Uganda,
21:15.700 - 21:20.760:  if Uganda refused to acknowledge that there are LGBTQ plus people that are deserving of
21:20.760 - 21:25.140:  development efforts in the country. And you know, one of the things that I said today is that
21:25.560 - 21:29.760:  the World Bank would have done the same thing if we were talking about other underrepresented
21:29.760 - 21:35.640:  minorities. Like, if there was a similar piece of legislation on daily people in India or
21:35.640 - 21:40.640:  bachelor people in Congo or Roma people in Europe, the World Bank would have been in the same
21:40.640 - 21:48.160:  situation in having to say, well, look, we cannot continue to have new lending activities until
21:48.160 - 21:54.240:  you have solved this problem. For Bruce O'Dars, in other LGBT news today, Iraqi authorities
21:54.240 - 22:00.620:  awarded media outlets when referring to the topic to refer to homosexual acts as sexual deviance
22:01.040 - 22:06.460:  and to also avoid using the term gender in broadcasts or publications. A government spokesman
22:06.460 - 22:11.260:  said the order still requires final approval and a dependency for violating the rule hadn't yet
22:11.260 - 22:17.040:  been set but could include a fine. Dylan Siwan is a journalist in Iraq. Well, let's not forget that
22:17.040 - 22:23.700:  this is only a resolution. It's not necessarily a law. Therefore, it cannot be like put into the law
22:23.700 - 22:28.780:  and imposed on these people. However, there are very dangerous implications of such resolutions
22:29.560 - 22:34.180:  because the community is already suffering from a lot. They are already been persecuted for
22:34.180 - 22:41.700:  being who they are and this will in the long term may cause even more harmful implications because
22:41.700 - 22:49.940:  this will cause what is already a culture, a society that does not accept these people will just
22:49.940 - 22:55.700:  cause them to antagonize against the community even more. It's not said yet how the order is
22:55.700 - 23:00.620:  going to be carried out whether there will be, I don't know, people will be arrested or they will
23:00.620 - 23:06.900:  be fined for this but even if there is a payment or a fine regarding the use of the work, homosexuality
23:06.900 - 23:13.100:  or even gender for that matter. It's going to be very bad for journalists that are covering such
23:13.100 - 23:20.400:  stories and covering the lives of the LGBT community. Dylan Siwan in Iraq. Australia's national
23:20.400 - 23:25.520:  science agency and Boeing have announced plans to develop a sustainable domestic jet fuel.
23:25.520 - 23:30.500:  Aircraft will be powered by renewable sources and that could significantly cut carbon emissions.
23:31.200 - 23:35.980:  From Sydney, our correspondent Phil Mercer. Research has said that Australia has enough
23:35.980 - 23:43.080:  agricultural waste, animal fats and vegetable oils to make almost 5 billion litres of sustainable
23:43.080 - 23:52.740:  aviation fuel by 2025. A Boeing 747 jumbo carries about 240,000 litres of fuel.
23:53.760 - 23:59.160:  By changing the molecular structure of waste products, using a range of different pressures
23:59.160 - 24:05.460:  and temperatures and sometimes adding hydrogen, scientists believe they can create a fuel that's
24:05.460 - 24:12.900:  almost identical to its traditional kerosene cousin. Max Temminghoff is from the CSIRO,
24:12.900 - 24:19.940:  Australia's national science agency. Sustainable aviation fuel or SAF for short is a safe
24:19.940 - 24:25.620:  replacement for fossil-derived conventional jet fuel. Instead of being produced from crude oil,
24:25.660 - 24:31.240:  it's generated from non-fossil raw materials or feedstocks. And the beauty of that is that it
24:31.240 - 24:36.160:  provides a net reduction in CO2 emissions when compared to its fossil-derived equivalent.
24:36.860 - 24:42.940:  SAF costs up to 2 to 4 times as much as conventional jet fuel. Apart from costs, various other
24:42.940 - 24:49.540:  challenges must be overcome in Australia. They include guaranteeing the supply of raw materials
24:50.160 - 24:56.960:  and conforming to international regulations. The International Energy Agency has said that aviation
24:56.960 - 25:05.200:  accounts for about 2% of global CO2 emissions, but it's one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise.
25:06.080 - 25:12.940:  The IEA has also asserted that planned production of sustainable aviation fuels would satisfy
25:12.940 - 25:19.740:  just a small fraction of demand by 2027. Quantas, Australia's national carrier,
25:19.740 - 25:26.120:  once 10% of its fuel, to come from sustainable sources by the end of the decade.
25:27.120 - 25:32.800:  Phil Mercer in Sydney. It was the final date of Taylor Swift's record-breaking tour at the
25:32.800 - 25:38.200:  Sophie Stadium in Los Angeles. Fans had an idea something special might happen, some kind of
25:38.200 - 25:44.700:  announcement. They were right. A new album called 1989, Taylor's version is on the way in a couple
25:44.700 - 25:49.840:  of months in October. Iona Hapsen is here with more. So just explain to us what the Taylor's
25:49.840 - 25:54.280:  version of each album is. Yes, the Taylor Swift has been on a personal mission for the last
25:54.280 - 26:00.800:  couple of years to re-release her first six studio albums. The reason for this is that in 2019,
26:00.800 - 26:06.760:  she came in a dispute with her former record label Big Machine Records, the founder and the
26:06.760 - 26:12.800:  new owner who wanted to sell all of her six albums that they owned their masters of to a private
26:12.800 - 26:18.940:  equity company. It's estimated this was sold for about $300 million. Taylor Swift was not happy
26:18.940 - 26:23.600:  about this because they were the masters. They could control things like the licensing of the
26:23.600 - 26:28.600:  song, so whether it's used in an advert or a film, for instance. So what she's been doing is
26:28.600 - 26:33.500:  re-releasing these songs, which are almost covers of her songs in that sort of technical way.
26:33.640 - 26:34.940:  They're stripped back a bit. Absolutely.
26:34.940 - 26:38.700:  They're more acoustic. For sure. So what's the differences are? Of course,
26:38.700 - 26:43.000:  has sound a bit more mature, her voice is mature, but there are just like differences in the production,
26:43.000 - 26:47.260:  some of the lyrics. So there are differences and you find that with Taylor Swift fans,
26:47.260 - 26:51.760:  they'd much rather listen to the Taylor Swift versions, the Taylor versions of it,
26:51.760 - 26:56.840:  rather than the originals. Okay, now the announcement on the 9th of August to be
26:56.840 - 27:01.340:  next expected because she dropped hints. They're all to do with numbers, I think the hints, aren't
27:01.340 - 27:04.980:  they? What dates? Something's going to happen, that kind of thing. Taylor Swift loves to give
27:04.980 - 27:09.940:  clues to her fans and her fans love to try and understand them, whether they're in her music videos
27:09.940 - 27:15.780:  or on social media. With this social media post that she released today, she was talking about how
27:15.780 - 27:22.440:  1989 is one of her favorite rerecords. There'll be five new unreleased tracks, which she says are
27:22.440 - 27:26.180:  some of the best that she can't even believe they were ever left behind. So this will be really
27:26.180 - 27:31.740:  exciting for Taylor Swift fans. And this comes at the end of the North America section of her
27:32.060 - 27:36.200:  era's tour, which has broken all kinds of records and even caused earth tremors in
27:36.200 - 27:42.200:  Canada a few days ago. That's correct. This is a huge tour, 44 songs that are divided into a 10
27:42.200 - 27:47.500:  acts three hours long. So it is a marathon to get through. And what's amazing about this is that
27:47.500 - 27:53.380:  the era's tour is expected to be the highest-grossing tour of all time, which is expected to have
27:53.380 - 28:00.040:  $1 billion in sales. This even surpasses Elton John's record, his farewell yellow brick road tour.
28:00.320 - 28:05.100:  So this just shows how big this achievement is. Lots of talk about Taylor Swift online today. Thanks,
28:05.100 - 28:11.800:  Leonor. And that's all from us for now. Before we go, though, clarification of an item we carried
28:11.800 - 28:16.920:  in the last edition of the global news podcast about the death of the musician's sister Rodrigues.
28:17.220 - 28:21.480:  We inadvertently suggested that he was popular in South Africa among young black people
28:21.920 - 28:25.700:  protesting against apartheid. However, a number of listeners have been in touch to say his
28:25.700 - 28:30.460:  popularity was predominantly among white South Africans. And we say thank you to those of you
28:30.460 - 28:34.600:  who pointed that out to us. Thank you. If you'd like to get in touch about anything in this podcast

29:16.060 - 29:19.000:  I'm really, really proud of Vietnam music. This is probably the biggest moment in their
29:19.000 - 29:23.420:  careers and Australians right behind them. World football at the Women's World Cup, from the
