00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:20.480:  by advertising. Now, you might have seen that Japan is releasing treated radioactive water
00:20.480 - 00:26.520:  from its tsunami hit Fukushima nuclear power plant. But how did the 2011 disaster happen?
00:26.520 - 00:33.500:  And could it have been prevented? It's on underwater, station blackout, reactor control systems,
00:33.500 - 00:39.400:  have lost all power. Fukushima, a powerful podcast series from the BBC World Service,
00:39.400 - 00:44.900:  tells the story, search for Fukushima wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:48.920 - 00:52.180:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:54.420 - 00:59.520:  I'm Janet Gillil and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 25th of August, these are our main stories.
01:00.220 - 01:05.240:  The head of Spain's football federation insists he won't resign over his controversial kiss
01:05.240 - 01:10.640:  of the women's World Cup final. The Kremlin denies having anything to do with the presumed
01:10.640 - 01:16.600:  death of the Wagner-Murstnery chief. Of course, there's lots of speculation about this plane
01:16.600 - 01:21.520:  crash and the tragic death of the passengers, including Yevgeny Prigogin. In the West,
01:21.520 - 01:25.740:  this speculation comes from a certain angle. It's all a complete lie.
01:26.560 - 01:32.440:  Donald Trump becomes the first US president to have his mugshot taken in his latest criminal case.
01:35.640 - 01:41.460:  Also in this podcast, how Taylor Swift's international tour could have a huge economic impact
01:41.460 - 01:52.440:  on the cities she visits. It was supposed to be a contrite resignation for sexist behavior
01:52.440 - 01:57.660:  that shocked a nation and the world. Instead of an emergency meeting on Friday,
01:57.660 - 02:03.960:  Louise Rabiales, the head of the Spanish Football Federation, abruptly announced he would not go.
02:10.400 - 02:16.200:  The audience mostly made up of men applauded him. Mr. Rabiales has come under growing pressure to
02:16.220 - 02:21.420:  quit since forcibly kissing one of Spain's players after they won the final of the women's
02:21.420 - 02:25.540:  World Cup. It had been expected he would announce his resignation at this meeting,
02:26.020 - 02:32.200:  but instead he's vowed to fight on, accusing what he calls false feminists of trying to kill him.
02:32.820 - 02:37.360:  He did apologise for grabbing his crotch while sitting next to the Spanish queen and her teenage
02:37.360 - 02:41.600:  daughter, but described the controversial kiss as consensual.
02:42.460 - 02:46.600:  Semra Hunter, a football journalist in Barcelona who was watching the meeting online,
02:46.620 - 02:50.880:  gave me her reaction to Mr. Rabiales' refusal to go.
02:51.500 - 02:55.940:  I would say on the one hand I was completely gobsmacked on the other hand I was not surprised at all.
02:55.940 - 03:00.640:  The reason I say that it was gobsmacked is that because after FIFA came out yesterday and said
03:00.640 - 03:06.340:  that they were opening disciplinary proceedings against him, it was very widely thought that he
03:06.340 - 03:11.400:  was going to stand down at that point because up until FIFA came out he had no intention of resigning.
03:12.180 - 03:18.080:  And so if you know the character and the person that is Luis Rabiales, it doesn't actually come
03:18.080 - 03:24.040:  as a surprise that he has in fact decided to double down, stay in the position and make some
03:24.480 - 03:29.940:  pretty horrendous comments to the assembly today only for the people and the audience to actually
03:29.940 - 03:37.380:  applaud him in response. So now you can only imagine that it's just caused a huge firestorm here in
03:37.380 - 03:42.660:  Spain, a people now pleading to the government trying to go through that avenue in order to push
03:42.720 - 03:47.700:  him out. And just talk us through what happened because he was making some quite incredible
03:47.700 - 03:55.340:  statements and as you say he was applauded for them. He made comments in a particular order basically
03:55.340 - 04:03.200:  blaming false feminism and saying that it was a scourge of society and that it was a character
04:03.200 - 04:08.880:  assassination, a societal assassination that everybody was coming after him. And he was thanking
04:08.880 - 04:13.360:  everybody who stood by him who convinced him to actually fight this and he's going to fight it
04:13.360 - 04:18.700:  into the very end. He actually doubled down as well on the kiss itself. He called it a peck rather
04:18.700 - 04:23.360:  than a kiss. He said it was mutual, he said it was consensual and he kissed Jenny as if he would
04:23.360 - 04:29.260:  kiss one of his own daughters. So he feels as though he's clearly done nothing wrong. He says that
04:29.260 - 04:33.980:  everyone has been after him for the last five years and quite frankly with good reason. If you look
04:33.980 - 04:38.980:  up all of the history of scandals that are associated with him, then it really isn't a surprise that
04:38.980 - 04:44.160:  there have been a slew of official complaints have gone after him allegations that have to do with
04:44.160 - 04:50.880:  criminal activity with misogyny and sexism. So it's really quite astonishing that he has decided to
04:50.880 - 04:56.380:  come out and basically fight this until the very bitter end and essentially he will probably fall
04:56.380 - 05:02.300:  on his sword here. But it really is quite shameful that there are people in such a position of
05:02.360 - 05:07.940:  power who think this way, who behave this way and it just shows that it's going to be very difficult
05:07.940 - 05:12.320:  to fight against and thus now people in the government will make the right call here and do
05:12.320 - 05:17.920:  something about it and get him out of the position that he holds. Because there's a lot of stake here.
05:17.920 - 05:24.660:  It's not just the way female players are treated in Spain, but Spain is also bidding to host the
05:24.660 - 05:29.820:  the World Cup in 2030. Absolutely and that was one of the main reasons why people thought he
05:29.820 - 05:36.020:  ultimately was going to step down because there was so much political pressure for him to basically
05:36.020 - 05:41.940:  put an end to this whole thing because Spain does want to host the men's World Cup in 2030 along
05:41.940 - 05:48.560:  with Portugal Morocco. So that's why at least the media are saying that for the longest time he
05:48.560 - 05:53.620:  actually has been protected because the government didn't want to make a big fuss about all of the
05:53.620 - 05:58.560:  other scandals that he is associated with because it is a stain on the country. It makes the country
05:58.560 - 06:04.440:  look bad and it severely damages the candidacy that they put forward in order to host it. There's also
06:04.440 - 06:12.060:  very, very serious allegations of Luis Brubialis recording for years now private conversations of
06:12.060 - 06:16.180:  high ranking officials within the government and basically using that as leverage in order to keep
06:16.180 - 06:20.880:  him in the position which is why the media are saying he's been protected. As I say there have been
06:20.880 - 06:25.880:  formal complaints that have been put forward now to the courts as of today and it does seem as though
06:25.880 - 06:31.320:  there is going to be some kind of prosecution or proceedings that are going to be carried forth
06:31.820 - 06:37.400:  along with in parallel FIFA to ultimately see what is going to be the outcome of all of this.
06:38.460 - 06:43.980:  Football journalist Semra Hunter from the moment reports emerged the plane carrying the Wagner
06:43.980 - 06:49.480:  mercenary chief Yves Geni Pregozion had crashed in Russia frenzied speculation erupted that
06:49.480 - 06:55.160:  President Putin had ordered a hit on the man who staged a short-lived mutiny two months ago.
06:55.260 - 07:00.780:  Now the Kremlin has issued a denial asked by the BBC to comment on these reports the
07:00.780 - 07:08.340:  spokesman Dmitri Peskov called such speculation a lie. Of course there's lots of speculation about
07:08.340 - 07:13.680:  this plane crash and the tragic death of the passengers including Yves Geni Pregozion. In the west
07:13.680 - 07:20.000:  this speculation comes from a certain angle it's all a complete lie. When we talk about this issue
07:20.000 - 07:25.320:  we should be guided only by the facts. We don't have many facts at the moment the facts need to be
07:25.320 - 07:30.540:  clarified during the official investigation which is being carried out now. The Kremlin spokesman
07:30.540 - 07:35.460:  also said it was impossible to tell whether President Putin would attend Yves Geni Pregozion's funeral
07:35.800 - 07:42.300:  since he has, quote, a very packed schedule. Mr. Putin waited a day before offering his condolences
07:42.300 - 07:48.040:  to those who died on board the plane. Our reporter in Moscow will learn and question Mr. Peskov.
07:48.680 - 07:54.080:  I've just got off the phone. There was a Kremlin conference call today. This is a conference call
07:54.080 - 07:58.880:  with journalists, Russian journalists and foreign journalists based in Moscow. It happens most days
07:59.340 - 08:05.720:  here in Moscow. It hasn't happened for about a week. It was the first one today since that plane crash
08:06.420 - 08:11.320:  near Moscow that's reportedly killed Yves Geni Pregozion and I asked the Kremlin spokesman
08:11.440 - 08:18.160:  to meet Mr. Peskov. What was his reaction to all these accusations, mostly from Western officials,
08:18.940 - 08:24.940:  that it was the Kremlin that was behind the plane crash that reportedly killed Yves Geni Pregozion.
08:25.180 - 08:30.740:  This is what he told me. He said it was a complete lie and he said that when we talk about this issue
08:30.740 - 08:35.980:  we should be guided only by facts. We don't have many facts at the moment. The facts need to be
08:35.980 - 08:41.940:  clarified during the official investigation which is being carried out now. In some ways echoing
08:41.940 - 08:46.460:  some of those comments that President Putin made on Russian television last night. He also urged
08:46.460 - 08:53.060:  people to await the results of the official investigation. He also, as you remember, express
08:53.060 - 08:58.280:  condolences to the families of those killed in the plane crash and also pay tribute to Yves Geni
08:58.280 - 09:05.720:  Pregozion but stopped short of unequivocally confirming that the Wagner boss was killed in that
09:05.720 - 09:11.200:  plane crash. So, you know, Kremlin spokesman today echoing President Putin but also going further
09:11.640 - 09:16.860:  when asked by the BBC specifically about those accusations that it was the Kremlin that was behind
09:16.900 - 09:21.380:  that and a very firm denial from the Kremlin spokesman there. Well, well, you know, I think it's fair
09:21.380 - 09:26.320:  to say that some people consider Russia's relationship with facts to be quite an interesting one.
09:27.720 - 09:33.380:  Yeah, that's right. I'm sure this will convince almost nobody. If we're talking about those people
09:33.380 - 09:38.560:  of course that suspect it was the Kremlin because if you watch Russian television, obviously there
09:38.560 - 09:46.200:  is no mention whatsoever of the possibility that possibly Russian authorities, Russian security
09:46.200 - 09:51.920:  services were behind this. On Russian television, the message very much is that, well, it's pretty
09:51.920 - 09:56.880:  factual actually. There was a plane crash. Officials are looking into it and that's about as far
09:56.880 - 10:01.720:  as it goes. But, you know, you're right. The Kremlin doesn't have a great track record on this.
10:02.240 - 10:09.140:  Whenever they are accused of almost anything, be it doping, state doping of athletes, be it
10:09.440 - 10:15.640:  poisoning opponents abroad, poisoning the opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The list goes on,
10:15.640 - 10:22.160:  committing war crimes in Ukraine. Of course, the Kremlin tactic, the classic answer to all that
10:22.160 - 10:26.900:  is always deny, deny, deny, deny. And that's exactly what they've done today.
10:27.980 - 10:34.220:  We'll burn in Moscow. As we reported on Thursday, Japan has begun releasing treated radioactive
10:34.220 - 10:40.060:  water from the Rex Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, a move that has caused much
10:40.060 - 10:45.560:  controversy in the region. Now the plants operator says samples of sea water taken from around
10:45.560 - 10:51.960:  the facility are safe. China imposed a ban on all seafood from Japan following the water release.
10:52.000 - 10:57.800:  As spokesman for China's foreign ministry Wang Wenbin said Japan is spreading the risk of nuclear
10:57.800 - 11:05.520:  pollution to other countries, labeling it extremely selfish. The Japanese side must change its
11:05.540 - 11:10.980:  course so that the water of Fukushima will not be the shame of Japan. Another point is that in
11:10.980 - 11:16.260:  response to the selfish and wrong move of the Japanese side, China and other countries have the
11:16.260 - 11:21.660:  right and responsibility to take legitimate legal and reasonable measures to ensure a sound marine
11:21.660 - 11:28.460:  environment and the health and well-being of people. But the operator of the plant disputes that,
11:28.460 - 11:34.120:  more from our Asia-Pacific editor, Michael Bristol. The operator of the nuclear power plant
11:34.120 - 11:40.620:  tech coers had a quite a simple message really. It says that the first tests of sea water carried out
11:41.060 - 11:46.780:  after the release of water began showed that the contamination was in acceptable levels and was
11:46.780 - 11:54.520:  essentially safe. Now this is the operator of the plant giving a news conference. Also you have
11:54.520 - 12:00.260:  at least two government departments in Japan, which will be testing water and release of those
12:00.260 - 12:05.500:  tests will come over the next couple of days as a fisheries ministry and the environment ministry.
12:06.040 - 12:11.380:  Also the International Atomic Energy Agency is on site and it's testing water, well it tested
12:11.380 - 12:15.780:  water before it was released in the sea. It's going to be continuing doing that. So you've got a
12:15.780 - 12:23.700:  whole raft of agencies and organizations testing this treated water essentially to try and convince
12:23.700 - 12:30.240:  people in Japan and Japan's neighbours that this water is safe and it's not going to contaminate
12:30.240 - 12:35.140:  fish to be used to seafood from around the plant. And they'll have a lot of convincing to do.
12:35.680 - 12:42.020:  They do have some convincing to do but a lot of the anger it's got to be said is quite political
12:42.900 - 12:47.360:  as I mentioned there. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been involved in this process
12:47.740 - 12:54.500:  and it's given approval to the release of water and the release of this water it's got a certain
12:54.500 - 13:00.660:  amount of radioactivity still in it but acceptable levels is an accepted practice at nuclear power
13:00.660 - 13:06.260:  stations across the world. So Japan isn't really doing anything that other countries aren't already
13:06.260 - 13:11.700:  doing including in fact China, the biggest opponents. So there's a lot of politics involved in this.
13:12.260 - 13:16.980:  So regardless of what the science is going to say I think you're going to see countries like
13:16.980 - 13:21.800:  China still making political capital out of the release of water. So it's going to be really
13:21.800 - 13:26.840:  difficult to convince them if it's politics not science which is driving your opposition.
13:26.940 - 13:31.260:  It's going to be very difficult for Japan to get China to change its mind.
13:32.360 - 13:37.260:  Michael Bristo the cost of living crisis has become so acute in Brazil's bigger cities
13:37.260 - 13:43.580:  Sao Paulo that's estimated as many as 50,000 people there are sleeping rough. In a country known
13:43.580 - 13:50.000:  for its inequality and expensive housing even the slums or favellas are becoming unaffordable.
13:50.000 - 13:55.560:  The city is having to think of new ways of trying to get families off the streets as our South
13:55.560 - 13:57.880:  America correspondent Katie Watson reports.
14:03.060 - 14:09.120:  This is Parasopolis, Paradise City in English. The music belies the truth in this colorful
14:09.120 - 14:13.420:  neighborhood. For residents here life is hardly a delic.
14:16.480 - 14:21.160:  Parasopolis is Sao Paulo's biggest favela and the difference between the haves and the
14:21.160 - 14:28.420:  have-nots couldn't be clearer here with expensive apartments towering over this chaotic but lively
14:28.420 - 14:32.160:  community of badly built houses and unpaid roads.
14:35.400 - 14:40.920:  Elianne Carmo the silver shows me around the tiny room that she and her husband Adriano
14:40.920 - 14:46.360:  share. It's in a little alleyway off the main road on the ground floor with at least two
14:46.360 - 14:53.320:  stories of informally built flats above her. They pay $73 a month for a space that fits a double bed,
14:53.320 - 14:59.880:  a cooker and a fridge but little more I can see mold growing on the wall too but they can't even
14:59.880 - 15:09.760:  afford this modest space. Elianne shows us the school uniform of her six-year-old granddaughter
15:09.760 - 15:15.640:  who comes to stay here. Henny Lee has a heart condition and the little they earn goes on medicine
15:15.640 - 15:21.760:  to keep her alive. While their landlords understanding it's getting harder despite being given
15:21.760 - 15:29.360:  food and aid from local charities. But for some families in other parts of Sao Paulo
15:29.360 - 15:35.400:  life is even harder. We're in the centre of the city next to an elevated highway known as
15:35.400 - 15:42.520:  the Miyaka which is really famous here in Sao Paulo and underneath there are dozens and dozens
15:42.680 - 15:49.300:  of tents many of them with blankets that have been given to them by the city council to protect
15:49.300 - 15:56.840:  them from the cold temperatures that we're experiencing here. As the number of tents multiply
15:56.860 - 16:03.060:  the city council's struggling to fix the crisis in the north of the city a makeshift village has
16:03.060 - 16:08.460:  been created. There are 20 or so boxes that look a bit like shipping containers and they're
16:14.480 - 16:18.060:  positioned to form a little square. In one corner it's a playground, families milling around.
16:18.060 - 16:23.780:  The aim is to house 4,000 people in villages like this one by the end of the year.
16:25.080 - 16:30.980:  Carlos Besejo, Jr. is the social welfare secretary at Sao Paulo City Hall which is in charge of the
16:30.980 - 16:38.100:  project. It's a way of looking after people based on the well-known international concept of
16:38.140 - 16:44.420:  housing first, offering housing as the first step in helping to get them back on their feet.
16:46.020 - 16:52.220:  Daniela Martins shows me around her microhouse, as they're known, 18 square metres with a simple
16:52.220 - 16:58.600:  kitchen and bathroom inside. There's a double bed that she shares with her husband Half-I-L
16:58.600 - 17:04.600:  and their four-year-old daughter Sophia and a cot for three-month-old baby Henri. The pandemic hit
17:04.600 - 17:09.960:  them hard, neither Danny or Half-I-L have jobs and they lived in a shelter for eight months before
17:09.960 - 17:22.220:  this opportunity came up. At least for Half-I-L and Danny it's a start. This is a place where we are
17:22.220 - 17:27.980:  trying to get back to leaving society. To be a human being, you know, we just want a normal life.
17:28.440 - 17:31.860:  So many employers think that people who live in a shelter are bad people.
17:32.740 - 17:38.040:  For good and bad, the hope is that staying off the streets at least gives these families a
17:38.040 - 17:45.060:  fighting chance of a better future. That report by Katie Watson.
17:48.500 - 17:53.580:  Still to come in this podcast, new research finds that gut problems may be an early sign
17:53.580 - 17:59.740:  of Parkinson's disease. What they want to do is figure out if the brain and the gut are intimately
17:59.900 - 18:04.140:  linked. Would there be a way not just of flagging the problems early?
18:12.780 - 18:18.440:  Now you might have seen that Japan is releasing treated radioactive water from its tsunami hit
18:18.440 - 18:24.560:  Fukushima nuclear power plant. But how did the 2011 disaster happen? And could it have been
18:24.560 - 18:31.580:  prevented? It's all underwater. Station blackout reactor control systems have lost all power.
18:31.720 - 18:37.180:  Fukushima, a powerful podcast series from the BBC World Service, tells the story.

18:47.240 - 18:52.480:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. For most people, the moment of having a mug shot
18:52.480 - 18:58.260:  taken is one of deep shame, a permanent reminder of a criminal arrest, but not for Donald Trump.
18:58.820 - 19:03.220:  As you might expect, he's doubled down, actively promoting the mug shot with his first
19:03.220 - 19:08.840:  tweet, or should I say X in over two years, and the official Trump website is currently selling
19:08.840 - 19:14.920:  t-shirts, bumper stickers, and suitably enough mugs, emblazoned with a photo, captioned,
19:15.320 - 19:20.920:  never surrender. That bevado is certainly winning support and money from his Republican base.
19:20.920 - 19:26.700:  But the charges he faces in Georgia are serious ones, centred around an alleged conspiracy
19:26.700 - 19:33.060:  to undermine the election result there. He's the first former or serving US president ever
19:33.060 - 19:38.480:  to be indicted. This was his fourth arrest in five months in a criminal case.
19:39.240 - 19:43.820:  On his way back from the jailhouse in Georgia, Donald Trump spoke to the media gathered
19:43.820 - 19:50.220:  outside his private plane. When you have that great freedom to challenge, you have to be able to
19:50.220 - 19:54.980:  otherwise you can have very dishonest elections. What has taken place here is the travesty of
19:55.000 - 19:59.740:  justice. We did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. And everybody knows that I've never had such
19:59.740 - 20:04.300:  support. And that goes with the other ones too. What they're doing is election interference.
20:04.300 - 20:09.560:  They're trying to interfere with an election. There's never been anything like it in our country
20:09.560 - 20:15.240:  before. This is their way of campaigning. And this is one instance, but you have three other
20:15.240 - 20:20.980:  instances. It's election interference. So I want to thank you for being here. We did nothing
20:20.980 - 20:27.420:  wrong at all. And we have every right, every single right to challenge an election that we think
20:27.420 - 20:33.400:  is dishonest. And we think it's very dishonest. Our North America editor, Sarah Smith, told us about
20:33.400 - 20:39.900:  this latest chapter in the Trump saga. This is undoubtedly a dramatic moment. This may be the
20:39.900 - 20:44.620:  fourth set of criminal charges that Donald Trump is facing, but it's the first time a photograph
20:44.620 - 20:51.500:  been taken as he's been processed. And it instantly went around the world. There's an iconic
20:51.500 - 20:58.680:  image which can mean what you want it to in many ways. He's staring belligerently into the
20:58.680 - 21:05.040:  camera and you can read into that what you like. He clearly thinks it looks defiant and strong.
21:05.040 - 21:10.440:  And he's been posting it with slogans like never surrender under it as he maintains that he
21:10.440 - 21:16.240:  has committed no crime and done nothing wrong. He called into a right-wing television station
21:16.240 - 21:22.400:  Newsmax when he was on his way back to New Jersey from Atlanta and described the experience he had
21:22.400 - 21:27.560:  when he turned up at the jail, which is a notoriously violent prison. He talked about what it was like
21:27.560 - 21:34.420:  to be processed through this notoriously violent prison and also said before today he hadn't
21:34.420 - 21:40.660:  known what a mugshot was. I came in, I was treated very nicely, but it is what it is. I took a mug shot
21:40.660 - 21:46.560:  which I never heard the words mugshot. That wasn't impeached me that at the work school of violence.
21:46.940 - 21:52.580:  Donald Trump has been wearing all of the indictments against him as a badge of honor and using them
21:52.580 - 21:58.140:  to bolster his presidential campaign. He will do the same with his image. It will be adopted as a
21:58.140 - 22:07.120:  campaign symbol or emblem and it will further his case that he is being victimized, that he is the
22:07.120 - 22:12.800:  victim of a witch hunt by Joe Biden who is scared of Donald Trump running against him in the
22:12.800 - 22:18.580:  presidential election. This is a story he's been telling his supporters with great success and it
22:18.580 - 22:25.460:  has allowed him up until this point to basically defy political gravity with his poll ratings increasing
22:25.460 - 22:31.300:  the more crimes he's charged with and the same as likely to happen with this image. You know,
22:31.900 - 22:37.360:  mugshots have sunk careers in the past long before any verdict was delivered in a court case.
22:38.100 - 22:43.740:  This Donald Trump clearly thinks is going to help his campaign and that's why he's sharing it so
22:43.740 - 22:51.580:  widely using it to raise campaign finance and it will become emblematic of what he sees as his
22:51.580 - 22:56.540:  fight against the establishment and that is one that is very successfully binding his base to him
22:56.540 - 23:01.740:  and reaching out into other parts of the Republican Party because remember at the moment as he's
23:01.740 - 23:07.700:  chasing the Republican Party's nomination to be their presidential candidate. He's not appealing
23:07.700 - 23:12.880:  to the wider electorate. He needs to speak to die hard Republican voters who will turn out in
23:12.880 - 23:16.440:  the primary elections and he hopes make him the party's official candidate.
23:17.140 - 23:22.960:  Sarah Smith. Well, Brian Lanza is a Republican strategist who used to be Donald Trump's communications
23:22.960 - 23:28.380:  director. My colleague, Malfa Carney, asked for his reaction to the dramatic moment when the
23:28.380 - 23:33.560:  president's mugshot was made public. My friends are telling me and it sort of feels like the movie
23:33.560 - 23:38.000:  Batman and they put the bat signal out and they've activated the Trump army here in the United
23:38.000 - 23:42.000:  States. It's it's pretty crazy right now. He's back on Twitter. He's probably back on Twitter to
23:42.000 - 23:45.640:  raise a lot of money because that's where a lot of his supporters are and Twitter's a very effective
23:45.640 - 23:50.160:  fundraising vehicle and the mugshot was probably going to be a 20 million dollar mugshot for the
23:50.160 - 23:56.620:  campaign. 20 million dollars in terms of fundraising. Correct. And it will become famous or it's
23:56.620 - 24:00.880:  already famous. I mean, it's already iconic. You know, it's it's one of the most, you know, I mean,
24:00.880 - 24:06.340:  we we have a lot of iconic photos here in the United States. It you were Gima 9-11. But I guess
24:06.340 - 24:10.580:  it's up there in historical moments in the US. I guess it is now. Yeah, it's crazy. But I suppose
24:10.820 - 24:18.760:  those are moments. It would Gima great moments of heroism from the second world war 9-11,
24:18.760 - 24:22.980:  the tragedy, but also the heroism of the first responders. Are you really putting it in the same
24:22.980 - 24:28.000:  category as that? Well, you're asking me, is it a photo that's going to sort of be viewed and
24:28.060 - 24:33.040:  remember 20 years from now? Similar to those images of Iwo Gima. And so we're going to those images
24:33.040 - 24:38.540:  of you know, 9-11. Absolutely. The photo is going to be viewed in that context. Yeah,
24:38.600 - 24:43.380:  not equating it with the emotional or the physical or the the mental stuff with what took place
24:43.380 - 24:47.800:  at those particular moments. But if you're talking about the image itself, it's going to be one in
24:47.800 - 24:53.120:  the history books, you know, for the rest of American history and certainly embedded in the minds of
24:53.460 - 24:59.340:  of the American psyche for the next 50 to 75 years. How do you think Donald Trump himself is really
24:59.340 - 25:04.980:  responding to all of this? Because if we think back to the very beginning of these legal actions
25:04.980 - 25:10.820:  and that does seem like a long time ago, he was very concerned about having to do things like
25:10.820 - 25:15.440:  the purpl walk as it's called. Yeah, listen, I think there's been an evolution. I think if you look
25:15.440 - 25:19.620:  at the first indictment, there's still questions to how the general public was going to respond to that
25:19.620 - 25:25.580:  and he gained 10 points. You know, and so you know, the second indictment, he gained another five points,
25:25.580 - 25:30.720:  the third indictment, he gained another 10 points. I mean, he's gone up 25 points since his first indictment.
25:30.820 - 25:35.740:  So I think from that point, you know, as him looking at the political structure and the political
25:35.740 - 25:40.740:  challenges ahead of him, you know, this has now become a plus in the like leasing indictment days to
25:40.740 - 25:45.860:  become the new rallies. I think on a personal level, you know, he's probably, you know, he's human,
25:45.860 - 25:50.400:  just like everybody else. You know, I don't know if he's scared, but he certainly knows the challenge
25:50.400 - 25:54.860:  ahead of him. You know, he's been attacked since he jumped into politics since 2015. I mean,
25:54.860 - 25:59.520:  with this is seven years to just constant attacks, constant investigations, constant
25:59.520 - 26:05.420:  engagements, Mueller, Russia. I mean, so for him, you know, it's not like it's a shock to his
26:05.420 - 26:11.000:  system that that somebody's, you know, attacking him. And he's doubled down on his approach in terms
26:11.000 - 26:18.520:  of attacking the legal system as political in an interview that he's just been given to newsmax.
26:18.560 - 26:23.620:  He's again, attack the district attorney in Georgia. And it's working. I mean, there's you
26:23.620 - 26:27.240:  already see the polling data here in the United States that there's cross the tutorial fatigue.
26:27.240 - 26:34.320:  Donald Trump's former communications director Brian Lancer. Now, have you ever had a gut instinct
26:34.320 - 26:38.280:  or butterflies in your stomach? Well, these are just two signs of how,
26:38.280 - 26:43.580:  closely, our brains and our guts are linked. New research published by the British Society of
26:43.580 - 26:50.000:  Gastroenterology suggests that gut problems may be an early warning sign of Parkinson's disease.
26:50.000 - 26:53.580:  Our health editor, Michelle Roberts, told us more about the study.
26:54.060 - 26:59.180:  The researchers looked at around 24,000 people with Parkinson's and they compared them with
26:59.180 - 27:04.860:  some other people who had different brain conditions as well as healthy brains. They wanted to see
27:04.860 - 27:12.520:  if there were any symptoms beforehand that might help to predict the onset of Parkinson's.
27:12.800 - 27:17.540:  So specifically, they were looking for problems with the gut. And they found that when they look
27:17.540 - 27:22.540:  back at the medical records of these people in the US, they found that those who went on to
27:22.540 - 27:28.300:  get Parkinson's, some of them did have some early gut problems. And also when they looked at,
27:28.460 - 27:32.980:  flipped it the other way, they looked where the people with gut problems had a higher chance
27:32.980 - 27:39.080:  of developing Parkinson's. And the answer was yes for that too. That doesn't mean that everybody who
27:39.080 - 27:45.840:  has a gut problem will go on to get Parkinson's. But there does appear to be this link that they're
27:45.840 - 27:52.740:  interested to explore more. That is interesting. So what kind of gut problems and can they explain
27:52.740 - 27:59.600:  this link? So Parkinson's obviously is a problem with the brain and it's a neurological thing.
28:00.020 - 28:04.960:  Now the gut problems that they were looking at also seem to be nerve related. So it's things like
28:04.960 - 28:10.660:  constipation, difficulty swallowing and irritable bowel. So things about how the bowel's moving,
28:10.660 - 28:16.580:  which is quite interesting. What they want to do is figure out if the brain and the gut are
28:16.580 - 28:23.440:  intimately linked, would there be a way not just of flagging the problems early, but also intervening?
28:24.140 - 28:31.180:  Yes, because this could potentially help in diagnosing the disease early, or perhaps would it
28:31.180 - 28:36.380:  help in treatment to this research? Well, with Parkinson's, we have got good treatments. There's
28:36.380 - 28:42.860:  no cure at the moment. The early you can treat obviously the better, but diagnosis can be difficult.
28:42.860 - 28:48.480:  So that's why they're hoping that if you can find early warning signs, then you can get people
28:48.480 - 28:53.280:  the treatment they need before there's more and more damage in the brain. And other people have been
28:53.280 - 28:58.660:  looking at different ways. So recently we've heard about people looking at eye scans to try and see
28:58.660 - 29:05.220:  if they're a little telltale signs at the back of the eye where you might see a bit thinner layer of
29:05.220 - 29:11.480:  cells there that might be predictive. Michelle Roberts, the pop sensation Taylor Swift is currently
29:11.480 - 29:17.140:  on tour performing more than a hundred times across five continents with a massive fan base
29:17.140 - 29:23.040:  desperate to see their idol ticket sales were expected to pass one billion dollars the largest
29:23.040 - 29:29.480:  ever. Her presence can also have a huge economic impact on the cities she visits. On Thursday night,
29:29.480 - 29:33.540:  she kicked off the international leg of the tour with the concert in Mexico City.
29:34.080 - 29:35.820:  Olivia Wilson has this report.
29:41.540 - 29:47.380:  Taylor Swift is set to make concert history once her era's tour hits the billion dollar mark.
29:48.580 - 29:53.620:  But some say that could break two billion in North American ticket sales alone.
29:54.720 - 30:00.580:  But how did a 16 year old singer-songwriter whose career started in Nashville, Tennessee
30:01.240 - 30:08.640:  become a global brand and the face of today's music industry. As a now 33 year old continues to
30:08.640 - 30:15.940:  break records. Okay, full disclosure, I am a Swiftie, but that doesn't mean this won't be
30:15.940 - 30:21.560:  backed up by anything other than facts. She clearly never goes out of style.
30:26.280 - 30:31.940:  But this year's era's tour doesn't just churn out billions without millions being pumped into
30:31.940 - 30:38.040:  it. Just setting up the stage is estimated to cost upwards of a hundred million US dollars.
30:38.640 - 30:45.020:  The process of building it involves a team of an estimated 50 trucks operating on a tight schedule.
30:45.720 - 30:50.480:  It's reportedly the reason she gifted her drivers with a $100,000 bonus.
30:52.140 - 30:58.540:  So how has this tour managed to achieve significantly more success than her previous record-smashing
30:58.540 - 31:05.500:  tours? By the time the era's tour is done, she will have played 147 different football stadiums
31:05.500 - 31:12.260:  around the world and the tour will have crossed a billion dollars in just primary sales for tickets
31:12.260 - 31:18.020:  alone by the beginning of March next year. That's Larry Miller, the director of the Music Business
31:18.020 - 31:25.020:  program at NYU Steinhart. He believes it goes back to the smart marketing of her new album Midnight's.
31:25.020 - 31:32.360:  Taylor unveiled four separate vinyl editions of the album. Her fans use the physical vinyl records
31:32.360 - 31:38.860:  as an expression of fandom. They may buy the records and put them on the wall. We understand that
31:38.860 - 31:44.700:  half of the vinyl that is sold is to young music fans who may not have a turntable.
31:45.180 - 31:50.440:  But it's not just Taylor Swift who's caching in on her songwriting success. The Common Sense
31:50.440 - 31:57.000:  Institute estimates that the era's tour could generate $4.6 billion dollars in total
31:57.000 - 32:03.360:  consumers spending in the US. Hotels are one of the key businesses impacted by the Swift lift.
32:03.360 - 32:09.760:  Someone who knows this all too well is Tyler Morse, CEO of MCR, the third largest hotel
32:09.760 - 32:17.240:  owner operator in the United States. We own nine hotels in Phoenix and the Super Bowl was in
32:17.240 - 32:22.200:  Phoenix in January. There was also a big famous golf tournament on the same weekend and across
32:22.200 - 32:29.560:  all of our nine hotels we ran $400 average daily rate and we were full in occupancy. Taylor Swift
32:29.560 - 32:35.040:  came to town about three months later. For the four-day weekend that she was in town, same nine
32:35.040 - 32:43.060:  hotels we ran an average daily rate of $900. So by my estimation Taylor Swift is twice as popular
32:43.060 - 32:49.180:  as the National Football League. Taylor Swift's business success is unusual due to the simple fact
32:49.180 - 32:55.220:  that most artists' financial success is scarcely built on just their music. A lot of artists venture
32:55.220 - 33:02.180:  into other industries such as fashion, makeup, beauty, but Taylor Swift hits difference. As her
33:02.180 - 33:09.120:  monetary success is a direct result of her work in the music industry and something tells me
33:09.120 - 33:16.120:  she'll be sticking around forever and always. That report by Taylor Swift fan Olivia Wilson.
33:19.260 - 33:23.960:  And that's all from us for now but before we go here's Jackie with a look ahead to this week's
33:23.960 - 33:30.200:  happy pod. In this edition the huge relief in Pakistan after that incredible cable car rescue
33:30.560 - 33:35.500:  of two adults and six school boys. In India the woman whose education was ended early through
33:35.500 - 33:40.740:  poverty and early marriage but who just passed her 10th grade exam at the same time as her son.
33:41.280 - 33:46.100:  The volunteers in Switzerland protecting livestock from wolves and therefore wolves from people.
33:46.620 - 33:51.520:  Still basking in the afterglow of the women's world cup we will count down some of the best
33:51.540 - 33:56.320:  things about this year's competition and we will have the best joke from the world's biggest
33:56.320 - 34:00.860:  arts festival all in the happy pod available from Saturday the 26th of August.
34:02.160 - 34:07.000:  And there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later. If you want to comment on this
