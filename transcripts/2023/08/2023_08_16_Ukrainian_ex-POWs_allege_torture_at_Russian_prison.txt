00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.980:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.300 - 00:23.660:  I'm Valerie Sanderson at 1300Is GMT on the 16th of August. These are our main stories.
00:23.660 - 00:29.740:  A BBC investigation has been told by Ukrainian prisoners of war about their ill treatment
00:29.740 - 00:35.500:  while they were held in Russia. The Vietnamese electric car startup company VinFast
00:35.860 - 00:42.600:  is now worth almost twice as much as Ford or General Motors after making its US stock market debut.
00:44.880 - 00:49.980:  And the women's world cup in Australia. These are very, very, very happy fans seeing
00:49.980 - 00:52.860:  England make history to the finals as they face Spain.
00:57.160 - 01:01.120:  Up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers are believed to be in Russian captivity.
01:01.120 - 01:06.380:  Now some who've been released in prisoner exchanges have told the BBC that they were subjected
01:06.380 - 01:12.480:  to torture, including frequent beatings and electric shocks. A dozen former prisoners of war
01:12.480 - 01:18.320:  describe a pattern of extreme violence at the pre-trial detention facility number two in
01:18.320 - 01:24.100:  Taganrog in southwestern Russia. Such ill treatment would be a clear violation of international
01:24.100 - 01:29.640:  humanitarian law. The UN says Russia has not allowed its human rights monitors to visit the
01:29.640 - 01:35.460:  places where Ukrainian captors are being held. A correspondent Yuga Bachega tracked down some of
01:35.460 - 01:41.160:  those who were held in Taganrog to hear their stories. Artham was a sniper with the Azof
01:41.160 - 01:48.140:  regiment in Medyupo. Last year in May the city was under a Russian siege. He wanted to keep
01:48.140 - 01:54.000:  on fighting, but Ukraine ordered its troops in the Azof-style steelworks to surrender.
02:04.260 - 02:08.400:  Artham was eventually taken to a detention center in the Russian city of Taganrog,
02:08.400 - 02:14.840:  a two-hour drive from Medyupo. He was held there for seven months. He says he was frequently beaten
02:14.840 - 02:19.460:  and given electric shocks. He often witnessed other captives suffering too.
02:21.920 - 02:27.360:  After the beatings one day, I was brought to a room. I saw a young man holding his hands up.
02:27.360 - 02:34.180:  His fingers were bleeding. Did they insert needles under your fingernails? I asked. He said, yes.
02:41.160 - 02:45.520:  I spent weeks tracking down Ukrainians who had been taken to Taganrog and returned.
02:46.360 - 02:52.260:  People like Irina, who is now a conscript officer in the military. She was a combat medic when
02:52.260 - 02:57.660:  she surrendered. She says not even the women were spared the brutality of the guards.
02:59.420 - 03:04.840:  She held this scariest part was when they called you out for interrogation.
03:07.660 - 03:13.780:  They dragged us by our hair. They beat us in the kidneys, in the ribs, with hammers and
03:13.780 - 03:22.280:  batons. How do you describe Taganrog? Only devils live and work there.
03:26.300 - 03:32.020:  In Western Ukraine, I tracked down Dennis, a military surgeon, who's just finished a night shift
03:32.020 - 03:37.880:  at a public hospital. He tells me captives were beaten as soon as they arrived in the prison,
03:38.420 - 03:45.700:  in rooms, hallways and even in the shower. He was left with three broken ribs and could barely breathe.
03:48.340 - 03:53.720:  They threw me on the floor, ordered me to not lift my head up and gave me electric shocks
03:53.720 - 04:02.500:  until they discharged the entire taser battery on me. You are convulsing if you lift your head
04:02.500 - 04:10.660:  off the floor. They start beating you and the circle never ends. Ukraine says 9 in every 10
04:10.660 - 04:16.480:  prisoners who've been returned are alleged they were tortured. Demetra Lubinets is the Ukrainian
04:16.480 - 04:23.040:  ombudsman for human rights. This is the biggest challenge for me now. How to protect our people
04:23.040 - 04:29.000:  on Russian side and I don't know how and nobody knows how we can do it.
04:31.960 - 04:37.140:  The Russian Defense Ministry hasn't replied to our requests for comment, but prisoners who
04:37.140 - 04:42.700:  opts like this one give hope to families still waiting to see their loved ones again.
04:46.260 - 04:51.420:  Back with Artem, we watch a video of his release. How do you recover from all of this?
04:53.320 - 04:58.380:  I'm currently undergoing treatment and my priorities to take care of my health so I can
04:58.380 - 05:05.020:  put on my uniform, pick up my weapons and defend my country. This investigation is supported
05:05.020 - 05:10.720:  by testimony from a dozen former detainees of the Facility in Tagongrog. All of them describe
05:10.720 - 05:16.220:  widespread physical and psychological torture. It wasn't something that was being done by some
05:16.300 - 05:23.640:  guards. They say it was routine. One former captain even told me a cellmate had died as a result of
05:23.640 - 05:28.780:  the violence. For those who are back in Ukraine, there's a long journey towards recovery,
05:29.500 - 05:36.320:  but those who are still in captivity may be suffering similar abuse without knowing when or if
05:36.320 - 05:42.140:  they'll finally be freed. Ugo Bachega. A merchant ship has left the Ukrainian
05:42.140 - 05:47.520:  port of Odessa after being trapped there since Russia's full-scale invasion. Kiev is an
05:47.520 - 05:52.380:  Einstein humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea after Russia pulled out of a deal last month,
05:52.380 - 05:58.080:  which had allowed Ukraine to export grain. But Moscow has given no assurances, it will allow
05:58.080 - 06:03.940:  safe passage. James Waters has more. There are quarters of the insurance and shipping industries
06:03.940 - 06:09.820:  which are concerned about how safe this proposed route is. Even Kiev, its architects, has
06:09.820 - 06:14.980:  acknowledged the risks posed by both sea mines and the Russian Navy itself. Nevertheless,
06:14.980 - 06:19.940:  the Hong Kong flagged Joseph Schultz container ship made her way out this morning with more than
06:19.940 - 06:26.140:  30,000 tons of cargo on board. Given how, just three days ago, a Russian warship fired warning
06:26.140 - 06:30.900:  shots at a vessel before boarding it for an inspection, there are little to no guarantees
06:30.900 - 06:36.300:  that Joseph Schultz will make it through the Black Sea without incident. Moscow is also continuing
06:36.300 - 06:42.060:  to hit Ukrainian ports with drone strikes. James Waters has. The Vietnamese electrical car
06:42.060 - 06:47.460:  company Vinfast has made a spectacular debut on its first day of trading and is now valued
06:47.460 - 06:52.980:  higher than Ford and General Motors. That makes the founder of Vinfast, already the wealthiest man
06:52.980 - 06:58.520:  in Vietnam, the fifth richest in Asia, a correspondent in Singapore, Kitty Silver, tell me more.
06:59.140 - 07:04.280:  It's had such an amazing debut on the New York Stock Exchange, but for many, people haven't
07:04.280 - 07:09.840:  heard of it before. So it's called Vinfast. It's headquartered in Vietnam and it has been one of
07:09.840 - 07:14.900:  the electric vehicle makers in the Southeast Asian country that people have been watching. It's owned
07:14.900 - 07:21.260:  by the biggest conglomerate in Vietnam, so it therefore has deep investment pockets behind it.
07:21.580 - 07:27.700:  And in fact, it's founder and chairman made about $39 billion yesterday, given this listing and
07:27.700 - 07:33.820:  how well it did in its listing. So it listed by what's known as a special purpose acquisition
07:33.820 - 07:39.620:  company or a SPAC. And many people have been very bullish about what Vietnam's electric vehicle
07:39.620 - 07:45.620:  industry could bring, because it's a low cost it has advanced manufacturing. And it doesn't have
07:45.620 - 07:50.440:  those geopolitical risks that you see with something like China, which has been providing a great
07:50.440 - 07:54.920:  deal of competition to the United States. And so people have been very bullish about what Vietnam
07:54.920 - 08:00.360:  might do in this space. It is extraordinary though, isn't it? Because Vinfast is now valued
08:00.880 - 08:06.940:  far higher than Ford and GM Motors after just its first day of trading. Why is that?
08:07.860 - 08:13.680:  That's right. And to give your listeners an idea of the figures, the way it did, it went up 255%
08:13.980 - 08:20.720:  huge debut. And in fact, now it's valued at $85 billion. That's its stock market valuation.
08:20.720 - 08:26.080:  That's much higher than Ford, which is about $48 billion in general motors, which is about $46 billion.
08:26.140 - 08:33.880:  In part, there was very slim trade. So there's only about $185 million worth of trading. And in part,
08:33.880 - 08:39.800:  that is because it's chairman and founder, according to regulatory findings, owned about 99% of the shares
08:39.800 - 08:44.440:  at the start of the day. And so because there are that slim sort of trading that I mention,
08:44.440 - 08:51.180:  we can see these big swings and this very volatile market reaction. And yet this firm has never
08:51.180 - 08:56.260:  met a profit. That's right. And so to give you an idea in the first six months of this year,
08:56.260 - 09:01.980:  it actually made a loss of almost half more than, in fact, half a billion dollars. And it's
09:02.240 - 09:07.140:  revenue, in fact, slipped. But this is because, as I say, getting into the electric vehicle
09:07.140 - 09:11.520:  making space is very expensive. As you can imagine, it costs a lot to develop one of these cars.
09:11.940 - 09:17.440:  And so it does require deep pockets in order to be able to fund it and to see it through
09:17.440 - 09:24.100:  to fruition. Katie Silver. Protesters in Pakistan have set fire to a church and attack the homes
09:24.100 - 09:29.340:  of Christians in Punjab province. Police said a few thousand angry demonstrators had taken to
09:29.340 - 09:35.500:  the streets in Jainwala district. Umadra's Nagyana from the Urdu service in Pakistan told me more.
09:36.160 - 09:41.000:  What we know so far is that police responded to calls for violent protests and the city called
09:41.660 - 09:47.200:  Jainwala, which is located in the Punjab province of Pakistan. And they said that the protesters
09:47.200 - 09:52.620:  they were attacking the church buildings in a neighborhood which is housed by the minority
09:52.620 - 09:58.860:  Christian community. And when the police launched the initial probe, they came to know that
09:59.380 - 10:04.680:  there were certain posts on the social media circulating in the area after which certain people
10:04.680 - 10:11.320:  from the local mosques, they made announcements asking the majority community people to, you know,
10:11.560 - 10:16.500:  come out on streets and protest against what they called was the alleged
10:16.500 - 10:23.040:  desecration of pages of Quran was done by two men from the minority Christian community
10:23.040 - 10:27.440:  according to these people. So the police tried to calm down the situation initially,
10:28.300 - 10:33.900:  the locals are pretendent of the police try to talk to the protesters and ask them to, you know,
10:33.900 - 10:38.900:  not resort to these violent activities, but it was very difficult for the police to control the
10:38.900 - 10:44.740:  mob, which was very charged at that point in time. And then when the time passed by, we got the
10:44.740 - 10:50.420:  news that I know the charge mob was attacking church buildings in multiple locations. So far,
10:50.420 - 10:55.620:  the local residents are saying that in that particular community, at least three church buildings
10:55.620 - 11:01.340:  have been charged by the mob. And the police are still trying to, you know, control the situation.
11:02.580 - 11:08.140:  And many people from that particular area have said to, it accumulated in
11:08.140 - 11:14.340:  forfeers of spillover of violence in that particular area. And what are the authorities doing?
11:14.340 - 11:20.200:  Are they just leaving it to local police? Yes. For now, the local police are trying to control
11:20.200 - 11:25.820:  the situation. And at the moment, what they're trying to do is to, you know, control the violence
11:25.820 - 11:32.260:  so that it does not spill over to other neighborhoods in that particular city, in that particular town.
11:32.880 - 11:37.600:  And what they've done is they've lost the formal complaint against the two men who were accused
11:37.600 - 11:42.980:  of desecrating the pages of Quran. They've still not been arrested, but the police are saying they're
11:42.980 - 11:47.040:  trying to assure the majority of the community people there that, you know, these two men will be
11:47.040 - 11:51.820:  arrested and will be tried in the court. And so far, what police are trying to do is, you know,
11:51.820 - 11:57.540:  calm down the situation and to protect the, the installations of the minority Christian community
11:57.540 - 12:02.080:  in that neighborhood. Umadra Zanagyana from the BBC's Odu Service.
12:03.300 - 12:08.160:  The battle for the place in the final against Spain in the women's football world cup has been
12:08.160 - 12:15.280:  won by England's lionesses, who beat Australia's Matilda's by three goals to one. The match was packed
12:15.280 - 12:20.720:  with drama and played in front of a home crowd that filled stadium Australia and Sydney from
12:20.720 - 12:25.720:  where Shama Khalil joined us just after the final whistle. Look, I think it's hard break for the
12:25.720 - 12:31.100:  hosts. There's been so much buildup in this country. And I'm sure, obviously in the UK as well,
12:31.100 - 12:35.880:  so many people watching this millions and millions of Australians were hoping that the Matilda's
12:36.240 - 12:43.040:  would go into the finals. But I am standing with two England fans with big smiles. Can you just
12:43.040 - 12:49.860:  tell us your names? My name's Tara. Hi. Gillian. How do you guys feel? Fantastic. Delighted. Delighted.
12:50.080 - 12:53.540:  You were totally outnumbered here, weren't you? A hundred percent. I'm ecstatic.
12:54.920 - 12:58.980:  Totally outnumbered. There was literally, I can't believe how few England fans were here.
12:58.980 - 13:03.880:  I couldn't spot you. I was trying to spot England fans and I could not spot you the whole game.
13:03.980 - 13:07.740:  And then they win. And you guys bring up. We made ourselves heard this pretty that way.
13:08.480 - 13:09.680:  I'm ecstatic. Come on, England!
13:11.660 - 13:15.340:  You told me before we came on air that you predicted this. What are your predictions for Spain now?
13:15.980 - 13:21.020:  Very no England's. Three no England? I think that's brave. I'm not going to say one
13:21.020 - 13:26.120:  no England. There you go. So these are their predictions. I'm telling you I was worried that I
13:26.120 - 13:31.620:  wouldn't find any England fans in the fan zone today because it was just a sea of green and gold.
13:31.620 - 13:37.060:  But I can see now red and red and white. I can see the England flag. I can see England
13:37.060 - 13:43.500:  beanies and scarves. It's not going to be as big of a party as it would have been if Australia had won.
13:43.500 - 13:49.960:  But these are very very very happy fans seeing England make history to the finals as they face Spain.
13:50.220 - 13:55.840:  Well I suspect Shima people will be scouring the booking for airlines and there might be many more
13:55.840 - 14:02.080:  people flying over to Australia hoping to get there for Sunday. But do you think that actually football
14:02.080 - 14:07.500:  is the winner in all this because of the legacy this world cup will leave in Australia?
14:08.660 - 14:13.920:  100% I think you've nailed it because I was speaking to former Matilda's and I was speaking to
14:13.920 - 14:19.420:  former players who say look this this has become much more than just the teams. I think the sternum
14:19.420 - 14:25.260:  it has become the catalyst and the testament to how far the women's game has come to how far
14:25.260 - 14:30.060:  it can go. I was speaking to some former players who say look we're going to have meetings about
14:30.060 - 14:35.620:  investment, about sponsorship, about what we can do to build this from the grassroots here in
14:35.620 - 14:40.460:  Australia and I can tell you safely that football or soccer as they call it here has been added
14:40.460 - 14:47.380:  to the list of sports that Australian fans will follow quite religiously. I could not believe
14:47.380 - 14:51.400:  my eyes when they stopped the rugby the other day when Australia was playing friends to watch
14:51.400 - 14:56.500:  that penalty shoot out. Something has shifted in the women's game and it has done so with the
14:56.500 - 15:00.400:  momentum of this women's world cup. Shima Khalil Insidney
15:02.720 - 15:16.920:  still to come here on the global news podcast. The U.S. banned the killers apologize after inviting
15:16.920 - 15:20.520:  a Russian on stage during a show in Georgia.
15:29.100 - 15:33.380:  Wow what an experience to be a part of the Tokyo Olympics. It's so interesting in my memory.
15:33.380 - 15:37.840:  It's one of the pinnacles of my athletic career. On the podium is the podcast where Olympic
15:37.840 - 15:43.560:  and Paralympic athletes share their remarkable stories from the struggles. Lots of sacrifices,
15:43.560 - 15:48.460:  lots of hard work, tears, a lot of things that the outside world doesn't know. To the victories.
15:51.340 - 15:56.320:  Anything that anybody else can do. On the podium from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever
15:56.320 - 16:04.320:  you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back. North Korea says the American soldier who crossed into
16:04.320 - 16:10.240:  the country from South Korea last month had wanted to seek refuge. In Pyongyang's first comments
16:10.240 - 16:16.300:  on Travis King, state media said he'd hovered ill-feeling towards the U.S. Army. From Seoul,
16:16.300 - 16:21.700:  in South Korea, Jim McKenzie, Tommie Moore. So this is the first time that the North Koreans
16:21.700 - 16:26.740:  have publicly acknowledged that they have Travis King in their custody since he disappeared
16:27.280 - 16:31.540:  nearly a month ago now. Now they say in this statement today that they have spoken to the soldier
16:31.960 - 16:37.740:  and that he has told them that he was being inhumanely treated in the U.S. Army and that he was
16:37.740 - 16:44.460:  being racially discriminated against. And also he had become generally more disillusioned with
16:44.640 - 16:51.280:  inequality in America and it was these reasons that led him to run into North Korea that day last
16:51.280 - 16:57.200:  month and that he wanted to seek asylum either there or in a third country. Now of course this is
16:57.200 - 17:01.980:  just what the North Koreans are telling us that Travis King has said. We don't have any way to
17:01.980 - 17:06.920:  verify it. We haven't seen from the soldier. We haven't heard directly from him since he disappeared.
17:07.460 - 17:11.920:  Washington today have said that they can't verify these alleged comments and that they're still
17:11.920 - 17:18.380:  trying to work hard to negotiate his safe release. But it is worth I think noting the background
17:18.540 - 17:24.000:  to this peculiar case which is that Travis King had been in trouble with the authorities here in
17:24.000 - 17:29.380:  Seoul where he was serving on a U.S. tour of duty and he was due to be flown home where he was going
17:29.380 - 17:35.980:  to be disciplined by the military, perhaps even discharged. And it was this we think that led him
17:35.980 - 17:42.100:  to make that decision to run into North Korea. Do we know where he is now or how he is?
17:44.140 - 17:48.780:  So the statement didn't give any of those details. I think the details that we all want to know
17:48.780 - 17:55.440:  where is Travis King is he safe? What condition is he in? We still don't know. And crucially it didn't
17:55.440 - 18:00.980:  also give us any information about how the North Koreans are going to treat this soldier going
18:00.980 - 18:06.580:  forward. Now they did say that Travis King had admitted that he'd illegally crossed into the country.
18:07.140 - 18:11.760:  So essentially he's admitted to the North Koreans he's broken the law. Now what that might mean is
18:11.760 - 18:16.800:  they might choose now to treat him as a criminal. He might be prosecuted but they also might
18:16.800 - 18:24.140:  decide to treat him as a victim of U.S. mistreatment, ill treatment and treat him as an asylum seeker.
18:24.940 - 18:30.420:  And could he perhaps be exchanged for someone else? It's very possible that the North Koreans
18:30.420 - 18:37.400:  will use Travis King as a bargaining chip in bigger negotiations. One option is that they will
18:37.400 - 18:41.440:  use him further down the line when negotiating with the United States when it comes to their
18:41.440 - 18:46.960:  nuclear weapons program. Negotiations that have been stalled for many many years now but as it
18:46.960 - 18:52.900:  currently stands North Korea hasn't shown much willing or wanting to talk to the United States.
18:52.900 - 18:58.680:  Jean McKenzie now to a story that's grabbed people's attention in the last couple of days and
18:58.680 - 19:04.560:  brought the term conservatorship back into the news headlines. The retired American football star
19:04.560 - 19:10.180:  Michael Oher who's racked Rich's Tale was adapted into an Oscar-winning Hollywood film The Blind
19:10.180 - 19:15.940:  Side is suing the family who had him placed under a guardianship order from the age of 18.
19:16.620 - 19:22.860:  Mr Oher an African American who's now 37 years old claims in his court filing that he was never
19:22.860 - 19:29.220:  adopted as he'd believed by the white family who he lived with and was instead tricked into a
19:29.220 - 19:35.220:  conservatorship. The legal definition and function of a conservatorship was highlighted by the case
19:35.220 - 19:40.780:  of the U.S. pop star Britney Spears who legally asked to be released from one granted to her father.
19:41.620 - 19:48.140:  VVC's Victoria Ouan Kunda has been speaking to Lisa McCarley a probate and conservatorship lawyer
19:48.140 - 19:52.520:  in California who was prominent during Britney Spears legal battle.
19:53.440 - 19:59.240:  There are many different ways it can be that a doctor makes the referral we use a doctor
19:59.240 - 20:04.420:  referral to establish a conservatorship for a very a person suffering from mental illness
20:05.000 - 20:11.140:  but in Britney's case they use a probate conservatorship her parents her father in particular
20:11.760 - 20:18.600:  would have to petition the court and a judge is supposed to review evidence of
20:19.120 - 20:26.620:  inability to take care of oneself or inability to resist fraud or undo influence so it can be a
20:26.620 - 20:32.820:  doctor in some circumstances that makes a referral or most of the time it's a family member
20:33.540 - 20:39.400:  and then Michael's case the two-y family apparently petitioned to be his conservator.
20:39.720 - 20:45.860:  And usually under these circumstances you appoint as you said a family member or a parent or
20:45.860 - 20:52.200:  a legal guardian and sometimes most of the time that two overseas personal financial or financial
20:52.200 - 20:57.980:  affairs. Can these guardian ships really strip an individual in the case of Britney Spears or
20:57.980 - 21:04.160:  Marco Orr and so many other Americans who are under these conservatorships of their agency and
21:04.160 - 21:12.380:  decision-making rights? Yes so basically that is one of the main reasons why conservatorship
21:12.380 - 21:19.180:  should only be established as a last resort when you're not able to use any other method
21:19.840 - 21:27.180:  and in Britney's case the reason they were able to get a conservatorship is because the court
21:27.180 - 21:34.660:  itself did not follow protocol. In Michael Orr's case I actually went to the Tennessee
21:34.660 - 21:43.080:  file and what was interesting is that he appeared not only to attend the hearing but the judge
21:43.500 - 21:50.440:  made a fine dean that Michael consented to the conservatorship and that his biological parents
21:50.480 - 21:57.500:  were also notified and consented to the conservatorship. And so what does that then mean for
21:57.500 - 22:05.100:  Marco Orr if he attended the hearing and he was in court when a judge did sign over his conservatorship
22:05.140 - 22:12.900:  to the two-y's? Right well unless the two-y's took further action the conservatorship appears to have
22:12.900 - 22:19.220:  been as I said largely abandoned had they pursued it of course they would have had the right to
22:19.220 - 22:25.880:  control his contracts how much money he made in his pocket how much money he was paid they would
22:25.880 - 22:32.800:  have had all of those rights but even within the four corners of the petition or the lawsuit that he
22:32.800 - 22:41.660:  files he acknowledges that he may have gone on to sign the contracts himself with the developers
22:41.660 - 22:50.260:  of the movie the blind side as well as his NFL contracts in practical terms it appears to me
22:50.260 - 22:58.620:  that it really did not have any impact on his agency or ability to negotiate there may be other
22:58.620 - 23:04.840:  disappointing aspects of the case in the sense that he may have really thought this made him a
23:04.840 - 23:11.360:  member of the family and it didn't but whether or not the two-y's ever exerted any
23:11.420 - 23:18.840:  power over him or signed any contracts on his behalf I don't think they would have been
23:18.840 - 23:25.380:  legally able to do that Lisa McCarley lawyer and legal expert speaking from California to
23:25.380 - 23:31.480:  Victoria Avancunda a form of gene therapy that's already been trialed in patients with Parkinson's
23:31.480 - 23:36.860:  disease might provide a potential one-off treatment for severe alcohol addiction the possible
23:36.860 - 23:43.520:  impact on alcoholism is being tested on monkeys researchers find that implanting a modified virus
23:43.520 - 23:49.920:  in the brains of the animals reduce any strong desire to consume regular amounts of alcohol the
23:49.920 - 23:55.420:  study opens up possibilities for future use of the technique in humans with extreme alcohol dependency
23:56.280 - 24:01.140:  James Coppnell has been speaking to Professor Kathleen Grant of the Health and Science University
24:01.140 - 24:07.780:  in the US who co-led the research we based this study on a large background of research
24:08.720 - 24:17.860:  that had implicated low dopaminergic tone in that's levels in motivational areas in the brain that
24:17.860 - 24:24.920:  are related to excessive drinking so small amounts of drinking will increase dopamine in these
24:24.920 - 24:32.920:  motivational areas but chronic long-term drinking actually decreases and may very long-term
24:32.920 - 24:41.280:  decrease this receptor system called dopamine which is sometimes called a reward system so we
24:41.280 - 24:48.720:  targeted to that system to increase dopamine hoping we would reverse this chronic heavy drinking
24:49.360 - 24:56.540:  and so far the early results promising yes it was a very very strong outcome in this study these
24:56.540 - 25:02.900:  monkeys were you know introduced to alcohol in particular we've been studying this model for a while
25:02.980 - 25:09.180:  so we know if we start laid out a lesson young adult male monkeys recess monkeys they'll drink
25:09.180 - 25:15.680:  pretty heavily on average about eight to ten drinks a day so what we wanted to do is see if we
25:15.680 - 25:23.240:  took alcohol away from them would they go back to drinking and and we know that they do so we
25:23.240 - 25:28.480:  divided the group into two and one group got this gene therapy and the other group remained
25:28.480 - 25:37.740:  without the gene enhancement and yeah we saw that it would block the relapse drinking it was
25:37.740 - 25:44.020:  effective it became more effective over time and it was over a one-year study so what's going on
25:44.020 - 25:52.820:  in the brain then of these monkeys what we did was we put down surgically put this gene into a deep
25:52.820 - 25:59.200:  brain area so it's it's invasive there's a surgery involved brain surgery we lower a needle down
25:59.700 - 26:05.400:  and we put the gene into the sprain area and then it becomes active it gets taken up by the cell
26:05.420 - 26:13.460:  incorporated into the genome and starts producing GDNF that's the gene product it's a growth factor
26:13.840 - 26:20.680:  and it enhances dopamine release up in these motivational areas so what we're trying to do is
26:20.680 - 26:30.340:  counteract the chronic low dopamine related to the desire to drink and people who are addicted to
26:30.340 - 26:36.740:  alcohol so we're trying to counter that by increasing the dopamine in this motivational area
26:37.160 - 26:42.300:  presumably the idea is that at some point this could be useful for humans how many
26:42.300 - 26:49.840:  steps away are we from that being a realistic possibility it's in the realm of being a realistic
26:50.540 - 26:57.960:  possibility because there's studies going on with this same gene being delivered to humans
26:58.940 - 27:05.880:  that are suffering from Parkinson's and Parkinson's is another disorder related to low dopamine
27:05.880 - 27:13.800:  but more in the motor areas of the brain than the motivational areas and so because this surgery
27:13.800 - 27:21.300:  has been approved and putting this gene down into human brain is in clinical trial right now it's
27:21.300 - 27:29.540:  possible this could be translated into a therapy for the most extreme alcoholics those that have
27:29.540 - 27:36.460:  not responded to conventional therapy professor Kathleen Grant at the National
27:36.460 - 27:43.220:  Primate Research Center at Oregon speaking to James Coppano scientists in California have managed
27:43.220 - 27:49.520:  to reconstruct the pink Floyd song another brick in the wall by analyzing the brain waves of
27:49.520 - 27:54.040:  patients who were listening to it the experiment could eventually help people with neurological
27:54.060 - 28:00.280:  conditions which impair their speech to communicate more naturally joy and wood has been listening to the results
28:05.860 - 28:10.640:  this is what the patients who all underwent surgery for epilepsy a decade ago heard as they were
28:10.640 - 28:16.200:  operated on a series of electrodes recorded their brain waves and now the results have been
28:16.200 - 28:26.140:  analyzed by powerful AI algorithms and this is what was detected it is muffled but you can just
28:26.140 - 28:32.580:  about make out the lyrics the research was carried out by scientists at the University of California
28:32.580 - 28:37.920:  Berkeley who hope their work could eventually help restore the natural lyrical pattern of speech
28:37.920 - 28:44.640:  to be blue band strokes or have neurodegenerative conditions the team said that with more sense to
28:44.640 - 28:51.280:  electrodes the results should improve and could be incorporated into implants ask why they chose
28:51.280 - 28:55.660:  the pink Floyd classic the scientist said it was just a song that they liked
28:56.860 - 29:02.480:  Joe Inwood the US rock band the killers have apologized after the lead singer Brandon
29:02.480 - 29:08.480:  Flowers told fans in Georgia the former Soviet state that a Russian man he invited on stage was
29:08.480 - 29:15.080:  their brother Georgia is still partly occupied by Russia after it invaded in 2008 and there's
29:15.080 - 29:19.920:  been a surge of anti-Russian sentiment in the country following President Putin's decision to
29:29.660 - 29:33.820:  invade Ukraine Stephanie Prentice reports Brandon Flowers the lead singer of the killers was left
29:33.820 - 29:39.920:  looking around at the packed arena in Georgia as fans began booing and leaving their seats
29:41.360 - 29:47.280:  the gig at the black sea arena down the coast from a region occupied by Russian forces had been
29:47.280 - 29:52.900:  going well but towards the end the band decided to bring a Russian drummer on stage to join them
29:52.900 - 29:58.860:  for their 2006 song for reasons unknown telling fans that the man was their brother
30:03.420 - 30:22.800:  Georgia gained independence from Soviet rule in 1991 and in 2008 Russia invaded it currently
30:22.800 - 30:28.620:  holds 20% of the land there and since the war in Ukraine started many Russians have fled across
30:28.640 - 30:39.320:  the border increasing tensions in a statement the band said they hadn't intended to offend
30:39.320 - 30:43.960:  anyone saying it's a tradition of theirs to invite people on stage to play the drums
30:44.380 - 30:48.600:  and adding that their words about tall fans being brothers and sisters could have been
30:48.600 - 30:56.500:  misconstrued fans outside seem to disagree on the clarity of the message gathering on the steps
30:56.500 - 31:03.000:  and booing at the stadium with others responding to the statements online saying the apology
31:03.000 - 31:09.040:  should have included mention of Russian war crimes and support of Georgia and Ukraine's territorial
31:09.040 - 31:15.460:  integrity Stephanie Prentice and that's it from us for now but there'll be a new addition of the
