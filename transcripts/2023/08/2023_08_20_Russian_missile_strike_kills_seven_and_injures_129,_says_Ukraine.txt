00:16.220 - 00:16.960:  Hey, babe, what you got there?
00:17.080 - 00:18.460:  This is a check from Carvana.
00:18.600 - 00:19.580:  I just sold my card to them.
00:19.700 - 00:21.620:  I went online and Carvana gave me an offer right away.
00:21.620 - 00:23.680:  Then they just picked up the car and gave me this.
00:24.320 - 00:25.480:  Well, that's a big check.
00:25.620 - 00:27.720:  Well, obviously you could put this towards your next car

00:34.300 - 00:36.600:  Or I can put it towards my next car with Carvana.
00:36.780 - 00:38.460:  Sorry, you're check, not mine.

00:48.980 - 00:50.620:  This is the Global News Podcast
00:50.620 - 00:52.460:  from the BBC World Service.
00:54.720 - 00:57.260:  I'm Jeanette Joliel and in the early hours of Sunday
00:57.260 - 00:59.880:  the 20th of August, these are our main stories.
01:00.700 - 01:02.200:  Ukraine is dealing with the aftermath
01:02.200 - 01:05.280:  of a Russian missile attack on the city of Chenyiv
01:05.580 - 01:07.500:  which killed at least seven people.
01:08.300 - 01:10.060:  The leaders of last month's coup in Niger
01:10.360 - 01:13.200:  meet a West African delegation for the first time
01:13.300 - 01:15.320:  in a last-ditch diplomatic effort
01:15.320 - 01:16.940:  to find a peaceful solution.
01:17.840 - 01:19.800:  Two Israelis have been shot dead
01:20.000 - 01:21.460:  in the occupied West Bank.
01:24.460 - 01:25.280:  Also in this podcast?
01:26.040 - 01:27.780:  There is no other river in the whole world
01:27.780 - 01:30.980:  where at the source there are turkey vultures
01:31.000 - 01:33.860:  and beavers and bears and then at the end
01:34.140 - 01:35.900:  you see the Statue of Liberty.
01:36.500 - 01:39.200:  The man attempting to swim the entire length
01:39.200 - 01:40.880:  of America's Hudson River.
01:45.940 - 01:49.020:  At least seven people including a six-year-old child
01:49.060 - 01:51.260:  were killed by a Russian missile strike
01:51.780 - 01:55.000:  which hit a central square in the northern Ukrainian city
01:55.220 - 01:56.760:  of Chenyiv on Saturday.
01:57.500 - 01:59.760:  Dozens more injured in the huge blast
01:59.760 - 02:02.300:  which caved in the roof of a regional theatre
02:02.680 - 02:03.800:  and blew out its windows.
02:04.560 - 02:07.780:  President Zelensky posted footage of the badly damaged building
02:07.780 - 02:10.540:  and wrecked cars nearby, urging the world
02:10.540 - 02:13.180:  to stand up to what he called Russian terror.
02:13.980 - 02:16.160:  Chenyiv is close to the border with Belarus.
02:16.840 - 02:19.360:  It was occupied by Russia after last year's invasion
02:19.480 - 02:22.140:  but later recaptured by Ukrainian troops.
02:23.080 - 02:25.460:  From there, James Waterhouse sent this report.
02:31.940 - 02:35.400:  You are immediately drawn to what has borne the brunt of this missile attack.
02:35.960 - 02:39.300:  The neoclassical building that is Chenyiv's regional theatre.
02:39.940 - 02:41.340:  The roof is heavily damaged
02:41.720 - 02:43.200:  and the windows have been blown out.
02:43.860 - 02:45.520:  Neighboring buildings either caught fire
02:45.860 - 02:47.300:  or had roof tiles blown off.
02:48.900 - 02:51.600:  The number of casualties reflects the timing of the strike
02:51.860 - 02:53.360:  and the fact that air-raid sirens
02:53.360 - 02:54.840:  aren't always acted upon
02:54.840 - 02:56.700:  because of how often they sound.
02:56.720 - 03:00.220:  Anna Zareba manages the restaurant next to the theatre.
03:03.800 - 03:05.060:  I saw two girls here.
03:05.340 - 03:06.460:  There was a lot of blood.
03:07.240 - 03:08.560:  One had her leg wounded.
03:08.560 - 03:09.920:  There was no skin.
03:10.220 - 03:11.940:  We put a tourney on
03:12.160 - 03:13.440:  and were waiting for an ambulance
03:13.800 - 03:14.780:  but it took a long time.
03:15.860 - 03:17.640:  Another girl was screaming loudly.
03:19.660 - 03:21.420:  A drone exhibition was taking place
03:21.660 - 03:23.640:  it's a possible motive behind this attack.
03:26.300 - 03:28.640:  Outside, Ukrainian and European Union flags
03:28.640 - 03:29.920:  hang beside each other,
03:30.460 - 03:33.060:  reflecting the country's continued alignment with the West.
03:34.160 - 03:36.720:  James Waterhouse will the mayor of Chenyiv,
03:36.720 - 03:39.140:  Alexander Lomako, condemn the attackers
03:39.140 - 03:41.760:  yet another war crime against the villains.
03:42.420 - 03:44.780:  But he also told the BBC that people in the city
03:44.780 - 03:47.480:  believe that Ukraine will ultimately win.
03:48.080 - 03:49.240:  It's difficult, of course,
03:49.280 - 03:52.800:  but during the war, people try to live normal life.
03:53.120 - 03:54.760:  Of course, people exhausted,
03:54.760 - 03:57.540:  people wait for victory for the end of the war,
03:57.600 - 03:59.860:  but we understand it not possible
03:59.860 - 04:02.860:  in nearest months, on nearest days.
04:03.500 - 04:07.000:  We will wait because we should win this war,
04:07.000 - 04:08.240:  we will win this war,
04:08.620 - 04:10.260:  but not tomorrow, of course.
04:11.100 - 04:13.580:  The mayor of Chenyiv, Alexander Lomako.
04:14.140 - 04:16.420:  Well, if the Russians were deliberately targeting
04:16.420 - 04:18.040:  a drone exhibition in the city,
04:18.480 - 04:21.100:  there's been a stark reminder why that might be.
04:21.540 - 04:24.420:  Saturday saw a series of drone attacks from Russia,
04:24.800 - 04:27.880:  one of them reaching a very long way inside the border.
04:28.340 - 04:30.560:  Our Europe region editor is Paul Moss.
04:30.720 - 04:32.820:  This information actually comes from Russia
04:32.820 - 04:35.480:  because Ukraine rarely claims responsibility
04:35.540 - 04:37.640:  for attacks inside Russian territory.
04:37.640 - 04:40.180:  What they say is they were drone attacks on Moscow
04:40.840 - 04:43.180:  and on Belgorod, the area neighbouring Ukraine.
04:43.180 - 04:45.400:  Now, the Russian defence ministry say
04:45.400 - 04:48.380:  they electronically jammed the drone heading for Moscow,
04:48.380 - 04:49.600:  causing it to crash,
04:49.700 - 04:52.160:  and they stopped the one targeting Belgorod,
04:52.160 - 04:53.320:  though they didn't say how.
04:54.040 - 04:56.180:  More seriously, though, is that they acknowledge
04:56.180 - 04:59.260:  one drone hit a military airfield in Novgorod,
04:59.500 - 05:00.800:  damaging a plane there.
05:00.940 - 05:03.920:  Now, that is quite an achievement for Ukraine,
05:03.920 - 05:06.840:  if as one presumed it was the Ukrainians who fired it.
05:07.380 - 05:09.460:  Because Novgorod is in the north of Russia,
05:09.460 - 05:12.180:  hundreds of kilometers from the Ukrainian border,
05:12.180 - 05:15.680:  so that would represent a big fail for those whose job
05:15.680 - 05:18.120:  is supposed to be stopping those drones getting through.
05:18.520 - 05:20.520:  So, given that, have we heard anything from Mr Putin?
05:20.900 - 05:23.060:  Yeah, well, he's been out and about hasn't spoken,
05:23.060 - 05:24.940:  but the Kremlin released footage of him,
05:25.400 - 05:27.460:  apparently arriving in the city of Rostov,
05:27.460 - 05:30.520:  which has become the military headquarters for the invasion of Ukraine.
05:30.520 - 05:33.640:  The Kremlin says he was briefed by the chief of the defence staff,
05:33.640 - 05:36.580:  but that word, that name Rostov, might ring a bell.
05:36.920 - 05:40.180:  Why? Because it's where Wagner began their mutiny in June.
05:40.180 - 05:43.780:  We saw troops wandering around Rostov as if they were in charge.
05:43.780 - 05:46.380:  Now, well, if Vladimir Putin's gone back there,
05:46.380 - 05:47.900:  it may be his way of saying, look,
05:48.420 - 05:51.340:  I'm now the one back in town, and I'm back in charge.
05:52.280 - 05:55.700:  Paul Moss, a delegation from the West African Regional Block,
05:55.700 - 05:58.600:  ECOWAS has held talks with the military junta in Niger,
05:58.760 - 06:01.160:  and what could be a final diplomatic push
06:01.180 - 06:04.160:  of finding a peaceful resolution to the political crisis
06:04.620 - 06:06.000:  caused by last month's coup?
06:06.660 - 06:09.220:  ECOWAS has repeatedly warned of military action
06:09.220 - 06:12.220:  if diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis are unsuccessful,
06:12.220 - 06:14.960:  but has not made public any specific plans.
06:15.720 - 06:17.680:  Speaking after the talks of the visiting delegation,
06:17.760 - 06:21.140:  Niger's new military ruler, Abdurrahmani Tiani,
06:21.140 - 06:22.280:  sounded defiant.
06:22.840 - 06:24.680:  He said his country did not want a war,
06:25.080 - 06:28.240:  warned that it would defend itself against foreign intervention.
06:39.580 - 06:42.700:  If an attack were to be undertaken against us,
06:43.260 - 06:46.960:  it will not be the war in the park some people seem to think.
06:49.260 - 06:51.420:  With more, here's our reporter, Chris Yoko.
06:52.160 - 06:55.680:  This is the first meeting between leaders of the junta and ECOWAS.
06:56.120 - 06:59.100:  It took place a day after Amici's from the regional block
06:59.100 - 07:02.900:  announced that a date had been agreed for military intervention in Niger.
07:03.480 - 07:06.080:  The coup leader General Abdurrahmani Tiani and his colleagues
07:06.080 - 07:08.820:  held talks with the ECOWAS delegation in Niyamei.
07:09.260 - 07:11.440:  Details of the meeting have not been made public,
07:11.980 - 07:14.780:  but this contrasts sharply with events only at this month
07:15.000 - 07:17.380:  when the military rulers rebuffed the same delegation.
07:18.060 - 07:21.020:  It comes as hundreds of civilians turn out in Niyamei
07:21.020 - 07:23.500:  to join a militia group to be known as volunteers
07:23.500 - 07:24.760:  for the defense of Niger.
07:25.620 - 07:27.880:  There are indications that the civilian volunteer force
07:27.880 - 07:30.140:  has been organized in response to the potential
07:30.140 - 07:31.880:  military intervention by ECOWAS.
07:32.420 - 07:34.700:  Local reports say the militia would be expected
07:34.700 - 07:36.860:  to support soldiers with medical care
07:37.160 - 07:39.220:  and other technical and engineering supports
07:39.220 - 07:41.980:  in the events of an ECOWAS new vision of the country.
07:42.640 - 07:45.560:  Chris Yoko, two Israelis have been killed
07:45.560 - 07:47.760:  in a suspected Palestinian shooting attack
07:47.760 - 07:49.120:  in the occupied West Bank.
07:49.120 - 07:51.240:  It happened near the village of Huara,
07:51.560 - 07:54.680:  which has been the scene of previous deadly attacks on Israelis
07:54.680 - 07:57.840:  and rampages by Jewish settlers in retribution.
07:58.060 - 08:02.300:  The two men were shot at point blank range at a car wash.
08:02.700 - 08:05.120:  Media reports say they were father and son.
08:05.760 - 08:08.040:  Roadblocks have been set up as the Israeli military
08:08.040 - 08:10.740:  carries out a major manhunt for the killer.
08:11.100 - 08:12.300:  Your land now reports.
08:13.100 - 08:16.100:  The village of Huara has long been a flashpoint in the West Bank.
08:16.100 - 08:18.700:  It's located on a main road south of Nablus,
08:18.700 - 08:21.400:  which is used by Palestinians and Israeli settlers.
08:21.940 - 08:24.260:  In the past, Israelis would sometimes shop there,
08:24.260 - 08:27.560:  but that's become uncommon since a recent upsurge in violence.
08:27.640 - 08:30.580:  This year, Huara has seen several shooting attacks,
08:30.580 - 08:32.780:  targeting Israeli settlers and soldiers,
08:33.300 - 08:35.540:  including the killing of two brothers in February.
08:36.060 - 08:38.080:  That attack triggered a deadly rampage
08:38.080 - 08:42.080:  by a large crowd of settlers in one of the worst such attacks in years,
08:42.500 - 08:45.260:  and there have also been other instances of settler violence.
08:46.480 - 08:47.200:  Your land now.
08:47.860 - 08:52.100:  A swim for 315 miles, more than 500 kilometers,
08:52.320 - 08:54.660:  the length of the Hudson River from its source
08:54.660 - 08:58.040:  in the Adirondack Mountains to where it meets the Atlantic Ocean
08:58.440 - 08:59.440:  in New York City.
08:59.700 - 09:02.540:  That's the latest challenge British endurance swimmer,
09:02.820 - 09:04.400:  Lewis Pugh, has set for himself.
09:04.980 - 09:07.400:  He's already made a name for himself as a first person
09:07.400 - 09:11.460:  to undertake a long-distance swim in every ocean of the world.
09:11.460 - 09:15.180:  His goal to highlight the dangers to the world's waterways.
09:15.720 - 09:18.300:  He's aiming to end his swim just as world leaders
09:18.300 - 09:21.960:  gather at UN headquarters for the annual General Assembly
09:22.360 - 09:25.620:  where the high seas treaty aimed at protecting the world's oceans
09:25.660 - 09:27.040:  is expected to be signed.
09:27.440 - 09:29.260:  A week into his current mission,
09:29.260 - 09:32.420:  my colleague, Lee's to set, asked him how he felt.
09:33.240 - 09:36.540:  I'm sore, but everything's been going well and I'm not injured.
09:36.540 - 09:40.500:  I think that's the main thing because especially at the beginning of a swim
09:40.540 - 09:43.900:  when you've got lots of rocks around, that's when the dangerous bit is
09:43.900 - 09:46.240:  because you get these rocks underneath the surface.
09:46.240 - 09:48.780:  We call them sleepers and you hit one of these
09:49.180 - 09:51.520:  and it can be the end of your swim very, very quickly.
09:51.760 - 09:53.400:  And physically, how do you feel?
09:53.800 - 09:54.520:  Definitely tired.
09:56.300 - 09:57.160:  These are long days.
09:57.160 - 09:59.000:  I get up very, very early in the morning.
09:59.000 - 10:01.960:  We're in the river and where we can't swim
10:02.800 - 10:06.000:  because they're sleepers or they're big rapids or waterfalls.
10:06.720 - 10:07.980:  Then I've got to get out of the river.
10:07.980 - 10:11.100:  I've got to run around the rapid and then carry on.
10:11.520 - 10:16.960:  So far, I've done 18 miles and I've got 235 miles to go.
10:17.560 - 10:20.500:  In 18 miles, do you know how many hours of swimming that took?
10:20.940 - 10:23.040:  Most of that, in fact, has not been swimming
10:23.040 - 10:26.920:  but actually traversing around these rapids.
10:27.420 - 10:30.740:  There's been a fair amount of swimming but there have been
10:31.500 - 10:36.060:  long, long sections of rapids but also water, which is very shallow.
10:36.420 - 10:40.160:  It's just a question of getting out and then making your way through the bushes,
10:40.160 - 10:43.380:  through the vegetation, through the forests around the rapids
10:43.820 - 10:45.320:  and then getting back into the river.
10:45.860 - 10:47.880:  And you're not taking very much with you, understand?
10:47.880 - 10:52.020:  There's no wetsuit, there's no fins, it's just you in the water.
10:52.280 - 10:53.120:  Yes, I like that.
10:53.120 - 10:56.540:  I mean, that's where I've always done every swim since I started
10:56.540 - 10:57.940:  when I was 17 years old.
10:57.940 - 11:00.600:  So, you know, I swam across the North Pole
11:00.600 - 11:02.320:  in just a speedo-cappen goggles.
11:02.320 - 11:06.280:  I swam in Antarctica, I swam across the Red Sea, unassisted.
11:06.280 - 11:09.400:  So it's a speedo-cappen goggles and I love it
11:09.400 - 11:11.440:  because you're connected with the water.
11:11.860 - 11:15.300:  But also, especially when I'm doing swims in the Arctic and the Antarctic,
11:16.120 - 11:21.100:  I do them in just a speedo because I'm urging world leaders to be courageous
11:21.100 - 11:26.040:  to make the tough hard decisions which we need to take now,
11:26.400 - 11:30.440:  to protect our planet and swimming in a wetsuit or a dry suit or swimming with flippers.
11:31.540 - 11:32.940:  I don't think it would send the right message.
11:33.460 - 11:35.680:  You've set up a challenge to world beaters,
11:36.280 - 11:39.540:  but why have you chosen to do to fight it in the waters of the world?
11:40.140 - 11:42.620:  Let me tell you why the Hudson, it's an incredible river.
11:42.940 - 11:47.040:  I mean, really, when you go to the source in the Adirondacks,
11:47.760 - 11:49.040:  she is absolutely beautiful.
11:49.180 - 11:52.680:  She's unique that there is no other river in the whole world where at the source,
11:53.400 - 11:56.300:  there are turkey vultures and beavers and bears.
11:56.600 - 12:00.880:  And then, at the end, when you swim underneath the George Washington bridge
12:01.280 - 12:03.040:  and you breathe to your left hand side,
12:03.040 - 12:06.060:  you see all the skyscrapers and then in the distance,
12:06.900 - 12:09.080:  you see the stature of liberty.
12:09.620 - 12:12.880:  I mean, everything which we hold dear to ourselves
12:13.480 - 12:17.540:  around the whole world depends on our shrinking clean water
12:17.540 - 12:22.940:  and breathing fresh air and taking care of our planet
12:23.360 - 12:24.640:  so that it's habitable.
12:25.200 - 12:30.000:  And I think the Hudson is the one river in the whole world where I can tell this story
12:30.000 - 12:34.980:  because this is a river which was badly abused and then cared for
12:34.980 - 12:36.500:  and it's turned its fate around.
12:37.060 - 12:41.060:  As soon like this, 50 years ago, it would have been absolutely impossible.
12:41.440 - 12:48.820:  But I think that the Hudson is a river which gives hope to people around the whole world.
12:49.640 - 12:56.360:  So what you have seen so far does it reinforce your view that even more has to be done for the Hudson?
12:56.660 - 12:58.960:  So we're right at the source of the Hudson at the moment.
12:58.960 - 13:04.980:  We're still high up in the Adirondack mountains and the water there is pure and clean
13:04.980 - 13:07.840:  and it's just magic to look at it.
13:08.000 - 13:09.800:  And that's the way all rivers should be.
13:09.840 - 13:11.920:  I say that rivers should be drinkable,
13:12.580 - 13:13.820:  visual and summable.
13:14.260 - 13:17.740:  So certainly when we get past Albany and we get into the
13:18.340 - 13:22.620:  lower sections of the river, we know perfectly well there that especially after rains,
13:23.520 - 13:25.620:  there is going to be raw serage in the river.
13:25.620 - 13:30.820:  There's going to be agricultural runoff and there's also going to be industrial waste in the river.
13:30.820 - 13:36.200:  And all these things which we pour into the rivers, they pollute our rivers,
13:36.760 - 13:40.320:  they damage our water supplies, they kill life in our rivers,
13:41.120 - 13:44.400:  and then they go into the ocean and they do exactly the same there.
13:44.560 - 13:46.160:  Rivers are the arteries of our world.
13:46.580 - 13:48.840:  Endurance Swimmer, Lewis Pugh.
13:51.680 - 13:54.900:  Still to come, go and pay the bill for these idiots.
13:55.480 - 14:00.380:  The Italian Prime Minister's response after four Italian tourists left a restaurant in Albania
14:00.540 - 14:01.200:  without paying.
14:16.800 - 14:18.680:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
14:19.400 - 14:23.460:  Firefighters in Western Canada are continuing to battle hundreds of fires
14:23.460 - 14:27.860:  of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate away from the advancing flames.
14:28.460 - 14:33.460:  Residents in the cities of Kelona and West Kelona have been told they may have to leave
14:33.460 - 14:37.980:  within minutes. Jason Broland is a fire chief of West Kelona.
14:38.460 - 14:43.500:  Our crews were sent to a street in West Kelona and they found three houses were burning,
14:44.360 - 14:45.340:  all next to each other.
14:45.980 - 14:48.160:  The fire was expanding up the hill.
14:48.840 - 14:52.040:  It was threatening hundreds of homes above those three.
14:53.000 - 14:59.920:  We had multiple fire engines involved in combating three single-family house fires,
14:59.920 - 15:03.120:  which on a normal day for us is a massive operation.
15:04.100 - 15:09.280:  Hundreds of kilometers north of Kelona, another huge fire is edging towards the city of Yellowknife.
15:09.580 - 15:13.800:  A state of emergency has been declared across all of British Columbia.
15:14.540 - 15:18.480:  Jacqueline Whittle is a meteorologist and journalist at Canada's The Weather Network
15:19.120 - 15:22.860:  and spoke to my colleague Harry Bley about the fire at Kelona.
15:23.260 - 15:27.260:  Well, this fire is really bad because it's impacting the second largest city
15:27.680 - 15:29.240:  in the province of British Columbia.
15:29.240 - 15:32.440:  So we've got Vancouver and the greater Vancouver area and the coast.
15:32.860 - 15:36.080:  And then Kelona, which is just south of where I live,
15:36.080 - 15:39.840:  is what is known as the interior of the British Columbia area.
15:39.840 - 15:41.640:  So it's a very dry kind of climate.
15:41.640 - 15:44.400:  We are certainly no strangers to fire in this area.
15:45.180 - 15:51.420:  But what makes this one so scary is that it is impacting a great population of about
15:51.420 - 15:57.600:  200,000 people that live in this particular area in Kelona and then a widespread area around
15:57.600 - 16:00.520:  Kelona with several towns being impacted.
16:01.180 - 16:03.700:  And do you know why this fire is so bad?
16:03.700 - 16:09.200:  I mean, I'm guessing because of the foliage, because of the land, because of the weather as well,
16:09.760 - 16:13.540:  is there any particular reason this has become such a severe wildfire?
16:14.340 - 16:17.380:  Well, all of the above that you just mentioned are certainly factors.
16:17.640 - 16:19.720:  As I mentioned, we do have a very dry climate.
16:19.720 - 16:21.880:  We're not actually deemed a desert climate.
16:22.280 - 16:24.220:  There's certain criteria that has to be met for that.
16:24.220 - 16:25.100:  But we're pretty close.
16:25.340 - 16:26.200:  We're very dry.
16:27.220 - 16:31.240:  And in summers, we always get some fire activity throughout the Okanagan valley,
16:31.240 - 16:32.600:  which is where I live.
16:33.220 - 16:39.140:  But what made this fire so bad and so quickly was it started as just a little spot fire,
16:39.140 - 16:41.660:  it was about 200 hectares large.
16:41.660 - 16:47.040:  And that was on, I believe it was Thursday and or may have been Wednesday night.
16:47.040 - 16:50.600:  And then within about 24 hours, the winds picked up.
16:50.620 - 16:53.100:  We had a cold front that worked its way through the province.
16:53.720 - 16:58.000:  And that gave us not only a wind shift, but we increased to wind gusts,
16:58.860 - 17:02.360:  probably close to 50, 60 kilometers an hour out of the south.
17:02.840 - 17:05.140:  So the fire spread rapidly.
17:05.660 - 17:08.420:  And so even though they were hitting the fire with water
17:08.420 - 17:10.580:  and emergency officials were watching it,
17:10.580 - 17:12.440:  it was really nothing to worry about initially.
17:12.440 - 17:16.100:  But it grew very fast and it grew into a populated area.
17:16.580 - 17:18.300:  And I mean, you've probably seen some of the visuals,
17:18.300 - 17:23.520:  literally people taking refuge in their boats among an inferno around them,
17:23.520 - 17:27.260:  not much different than Lahaina, as we saw in Maui.
17:27.260 - 17:30.740:  Just recently, much smaller scale obviously with that.
17:30.740 - 17:32.980:  And we've had from what we know, no fatalities.
17:32.980 - 17:37.660:  But just those images and a populated area being impacted is quite terrifying.
17:38.560 - 17:40.860:  And I know you've spoken to some colonial residents
17:40.900 - 17:43.560:  who've evacuated, who need to evacuate,
17:43.560 - 17:45.640:  or perhaps even lost their homes.
17:46.200 - 17:47.380:  What kind of stories are you hearing?
17:48.320 - 17:52.780:  You know, people are devastated because even though we do know that fires happen here,
17:53.760 - 17:57.320:  people have been evacuated even two times.
17:57.320 - 18:01.600:  So they've moved from one area because they were evacuated from their home or their cottage
18:01.600 - 18:05.300:  on the lake. And then they've moved across the lake to somewhere else with a friend
18:05.300 - 18:08.140:  or a family member or maybe an evacuation center or something.
18:08.580 - 18:13.140:  And then that area was asked to leave because the fire actually jumped across the lake.
18:13.140 - 18:17.140:  So I think I've met three or four people that actually had to evacuate twice
18:17.380 - 18:18.440:  in two different locations.
18:19.520 - 18:21.300:  Meteorologists Jacqueline Whittle.
18:21.980 - 18:24.400:  Across the Atlantic, the authorities in Tenerife,
18:24.400 - 18:28.920:  they raging wildfires there are the most complex to hit the Spanish Canary Island
18:28.920 - 18:30.300:  in more than 40 years.
18:30.800 - 18:35.540:  Around 26,000 people have been moved to safety as strong winds and high temperatures
18:35.940 - 18:38.920:  have helped to spread the flames in a tender, dry landscape.
18:39.480 - 18:43.200:  Hundreds of firefighters backed by planes have been battling the fires for days
18:43.200 - 18:48.200:  in a mountainous forested area with steep ravines where access is difficult.
18:48.760 - 18:51.360:  Cleo O'Flin is a journalist in Tenerife.
18:52.240 - 18:56.760:  No fire follows rules, but this seems to be beyond the normal
18:57.780 - 19:00.980:  extremities of fires that most of the experts have fought in the past.
19:01.460 - 19:05.300:  So it is very much a fire that needs to be brought under control
19:05.300 - 19:08.580:  before they can even begin to talk about extinguishing it.
19:09.060 - 19:12.160:  That being said, one of the slightly incredible statistics
19:12.160 - 19:15.280:  is that not one single home has been lost to the fires as yet,
19:15.780 - 19:19.040:  given I think the work of the firefighters in protecting
19:19.100 - 19:22.060:  villages and towns that they have evacuated,
19:22.060 - 19:24.940:  but they're managing to keep the flames away from the homes.
19:25.460 - 19:27.360:  Given our distance from the Spanish mainland,
19:27.360 - 19:34.280:  quite often it takes about 24 hours for firefighters and fire airplanes to scramble
19:34.280 - 19:36.200:  from Madrid and from other parts of the mainland.
19:36.200 - 19:38.620:  So that day all did arrive by Wednesday.
19:39.220 - 19:43.820:  We probably have about 500 military personnel now here fighting those flames.
19:43.820 - 19:46.140:  A lot of them have come from the Spanish mainland.
19:46.140 - 19:50.620:  And Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish Prime Minister, will be here on Monday.
19:51.480 - 19:56.300:  On the other hand, you do have the Tenerife Tourism Agency saying to tourists,
19:56.740 - 19:58.620:  please don't cancel flights.
19:58.620 - 20:02.780:  I spoke earlier to David Perez, who is the manager of Tenerife Tourism,
20:03.260 - 20:04.600:  and they issued a statement yesterday.
20:04.600 - 20:06.460:  He said, very little has changed in that.
20:06.580 - 20:11.360:  And one of the things that he pointed out was it's only about 3 percent of the actual
20:11.920 - 20:15.840:  mass territory of the island of Tenerife that has currently under flames.
20:16.400 - 20:20.400:  Now it might sound like a little, obviously, for the people who live near there.
20:20.840 - 20:22.980:  It's still a fire that needs to be controlled.
20:23.720 - 20:28.760:  Journalist Clio Othlin, the Pakistani opposition party of the jailed former Prime Minister
20:28.760 - 20:33.640:  Imran Khan has denounced the arrest of another of its leading figures as illegal.
20:34.280 - 20:40.440:  The vice chairman of the PTI, Sharma Mood Kureshi, was detained just hours after he said his party
20:40.440 - 20:46.780:  would challenge any delay to elections. Imran Khan is currently serving a three-year jail term
20:46.780 - 20:50.400:  and has been barred from politics. Electronase Smith reports.
20:51.100 - 20:54.780:  The PTI says Sharma Mood Kureshi was arrested at his home in the capital.
20:54.780 - 20:59.060:  He was taken to the headquarters of Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency,
20:59.060 - 21:03.260:  the latest move in what the party sees as a PTI clamped down.
21:03.260 - 21:07.960:  The arrest came shortly after he'd held a news conference in which he said the party was
21:07.960 - 21:13.260:  preparing a legal challenge to any delay in holding elections beyond the constitutional limit.
21:13.260 - 21:18.660:  The vote is meant to be held within 90 days of Parliament being dissolved, which would be
21:18.660 - 21:23.820:  November. But the prospect of that is slim as Pakistan grapples with constitutional,
21:23.960 - 21:26.280:  economic and political crises.
21:26.280 - 21:32.240:  Electronase Smith. The Somali President is a man intent on ending the decades of warfare
21:32.240 - 21:37.100:  that have blighted his country, as well as mounting an effective military offensive against
21:37.100 - 21:42.840:  Al Shabaab militants. Hassan Sheikh Mohammed is also trying to improve security in the capital.
21:43.460 - 21:48.840:  But on Friday, heavy fighting broke out in Mogadishu between police officers and a militia
21:48.840 - 21:55.040:  headed by a former soldier. The clashes continued for more than 10 hours with one police officer
21:55.040 - 22:00.380:  and two militia men killed. We got more details from our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross.
22:00.860 - 22:07.280:  Well, according to the police in Mogadishu, there was an operation late on Friday that began to
22:07.280 - 22:16.440:  try to disarm and arrest a militia led by a former soldier known as General Shago.
22:16.780 - 22:20.780:  And the police spokesman said this is actually a former captain in the army,
22:20.780 - 22:27.560:  who had quite a number of fighters under his control and they are accused as a militia of
22:27.560 - 22:32.360:  basically robbing people and money laundering according to the police.
22:32.380 - 22:38.700:  But what then happened was a shootout basically between this militia and the police that went on.
22:38.700 - 22:45.640:  We understand for more than 10 hours the police said at the end of all of this that General Shago
22:45.940 - 22:53.560:  and more than 20 of his fighters were arrested. And the police say that two of the militia men were
22:53.560 - 22:59.240:  also killed in the fighting and one policeman. I mean, it's somewhat surprising that there weren't
22:59.240 - 23:04.140:  more casualties seeing as this was a, you know, more than 10 hours of what was described as
23:04.720 - 23:10.940:  intense fighting. But it comes at a sort of interesting time as the president of Somalia,
23:11.460 - 23:17.720:  Hassan Sheikh Muhammad has really been trying to sort out the widespread insecurity in the
23:17.720 - 23:23.500:  capital Mogadishu. As you say, he has been trying to sort out the widespread insecurity in the
23:23.500 - 23:29.060:  capital and he's also been trying to launch a military offensive against Al Shabaab.
23:29.100 - 23:34.800:  What progress is he making in all this? So people in Mogadishu will say that it wasn't that long ago
23:34.940 - 23:42.240:  that there was, you know, every day you'd hear gunfire on the streets. Often people not shooting
23:42.240 - 23:49.080:  at each other, but just the sound of gunfire because shots were fired for all kinds of reasons,
23:49.080 - 23:56.340:  including even trying to get through traffic jams. Those that can afford it hire men with guns
23:56.340 - 24:01.920:  to try and protect them on the streets of Mogadishu. And that has been the case in the past that
24:01.920 - 24:08.740:  civilians have actually been killed because of these trigger happy gunmen who are firing bullets in
24:08.740 - 24:14.320:  the air to try and clear vehicles. But also, you know, there have been clashes between rival
24:14.320 - 24:20.800:  militias on the streets. But in recent months, things have improved. And the president is trying
24:20.800 - 24:27.240:  to ensure that the only people in Mogadishu are with guns, are members of the police force or the
24:27.240 - 24:32.420:  army. There is, of course, the problem, as you mentioned, of Al Shabaab. And it has frequently
24:32.420 - 24:39.220:  carried out attacks in Mogadishu, including just over the last couple of days, some relatively small
24:39.220 - 24:46.000:  scale attacks. But what's going on in the center and south of the country at the moment is a build-up
24:46.000 - 24:51.520:  towards what's expected to be a pretty large offensive against Al Shabaab. And the president
24:52.100 - 24:56.740:  has actually moved to the center of the country. And we're expecting him to officially launch
24:56.780 - 25:04.440:  this offensive. And he's sounding pretty optimistic. He even said earlier this week that he expected
25:04.460 - 25:11.800:  Al Shabaab to be defeated within five months. Well, Ross, now to a rather unusual act of diplomacy.
25:11.800 - 25:18.080:  After four Italian tourists caused outrage in Albania by skipping out of a restaurant without
25:18.080 - 25:23.700:  settling their rather modest bill, the Italian government has stepped in to pay it and to
25:23.700 - 25:29.040:  restore Italy's pride. To add insult to injury, the restaurant's own acclaims the Italians even
25:29.040 - 25:33.720:  complemented the food before they disappeared into the night. David Lewis reports.
25:34.320 - 25:41.460:  It's a case of diplomatic incident averted, but only just. The story started after a security
25:41.460 - 25:47.200:  camera caught the frugal force and heading out of a restaurant in the historic city of Burat
25:47.620 - 25:54.500:  without paying their $85 bill. The footage soon went viral, and the restaurant owner told Albania's
25:54.500 - 26:01.520:  report TV. It was the first time his patrons had ever dined and dashed. The issue was raised with
26:01.520 - 26:07.520:  the Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Malone, while she herself was visiting the country as a guest of
26:07.520 - 26:14.440:  her Albanian counterpart. And she wasn't having any of it. Go and pay the bill for these idiots.
