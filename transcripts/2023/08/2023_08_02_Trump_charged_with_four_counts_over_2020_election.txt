01:42.960 - 01:46.420:  I'm Garas Palo and in the early hours of Wednesday, the second of August,
01:46.420 - 01:48.000:  these are our main stories.
01:48.640 - 01:52.660:  The former US President Donald Trump has been indicted on four more
01:52.660 - 01:56.620:  criminal charges, including conspiracy and witness tempering,
01:56.940 - 02:00.800:  when he attempted to cling on to power after losing the 2020 election.
02:01.460 - 02:04.820:  The first French flight evacuating European citizens from Niger
02:04.820 - 02:06.660:  following last week's coup is departed.
02:07.460 - 02:11.560:  An Uber has posted a quarterly profit for the first time since it began operating.
02:14.360 - 02:15.280:  Also in this podcast.
02:15.900 - 02:19.280:  Voyager 2 has been exploring space since 1977.
02:19.280 - 02:22.620:  It's almost 20 billion kilometers from Earth.
02:22.900 - 02:26.580:  NASA is relieved to have received a signal from the distant spacecraft
02:26.580 - 02:30.320:  after it lost contact by accidentally sending it the wrong way.
02:34.080 - 02:36.860:  We begin in the United States, where on Tuesday,
02:36.860 - 02:40.540:  the former President Donald Trump was indicted on four counts
02:41.000 - 02:42.500:  by a federal grand jury.
02:42.500 - 02:47.440:  In special counsel Jank Smith's investigation, into the January 6 attack on the capital
02:47.440 - 02:50.060:  and the efforts to overturn the 2020 election,
02:50.660 - 02:54.460:  the charges are conspiracy to to forward the US witness tempering and conspiracy
02:54.460 - 02:56.180:  against the rights of citizens.
02:56.820 - 02:58.420:  Mr. Smith made this statement.
02:59.040 - 03:03.080:  The attack on our nation's capital was an unprecedented assault
03:03.640 - 03:05.240:  on the seat of American democracy.
03:06.680 - 03:09.600:  It's described in the indictment it was fueled by lies.
03:10.580 - 03:15.180:  Lies by the defendant targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the US
03:15.180 - 03:18.300:  government and nation's process of collecting,
03:18.300 - 03:22.700:  counting and certifying the results of the presidential election.
03:23.900 - 03:27.080:  In this case, my office will seek a speedy trial,
03:27.820 - 03:31.880:  so that our evidence can be tested in court and judged by jury of citizens.
03:32.360 - 03:36.520:  Before Jank Smith addressed the reporters, I spoke to our Washington correspondent,
03:36.520 - 03:40.240:  Sean Dilly, about this third criminal case against Mr. Trump.
03:40.700 - 03:44.540:  What is interesting is there are no direct charges related to the actual
03:44.540 - 03:48.540:  violence per se, at least nothing on insurrection or incitement,
03:48.540 - 03:51.220:  as far as the violence on the sick of January, because, of course,
03:51.220 - 03:53.660:  intent was always going to be hard to prove that.
03:53.660 - 03:57.580:  The charges relate to the period of time from the election onwards.
03:57.860 - 04:01.020:  Basically, there are six co-conspirators who are not named beyond
04:01.020 - 04:05.120:  conspirator 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, four of those are attorneys.
04:05.700 - 04:09.800:  And the allegation in chief is that Donald Trump and others worked together,
04:09.800 - 04:14.440:  essentially to interfere with the election to disrupt that peaceful transfer
04:14.440 - 04:17.760:  of power and to speak to legislatures around the United States,
04:17.760 - 04:23.460:  to persuade them not to confirm, not to certify the results that people had voted
04:23.460 - 04:25.660:  towards changing what they call slates.
04:25.780 - 04:27.780:  So if you like, that's a summary of how people voted.
04:28.320 - 04:31.600:  From Joe Biden, who rightly won the election, to Donald Trump.
04:31.820 - 04:33.560:  The indictment makes for interesting reading.
04:33.740 - 04:37.120:  Just thumbing through it, it goes through all sorts of detail in terms of how
04:37.120 - 04:43.220:  conversations were had with lawmakers where it was suggested that there were not
04:43.220 - 04:45.920:  necessarily evidence for the claims, but a lot of theories.
04:46.660 - 04:51.220:  With regards to the next steps for Donald Trump, what's coming up?
04:52.120 - 04:57.080:  Well, in the very immediate future, this Thursday he's required to appear in
04:57.400 - 05:02.420:  court in Washington, D.C. to face these four counts in relation to the election
05:02.460 - 05:04.180:  and the claims that he attempted to overthrow them.
05:04.520 - 05:08.120:  It's not the only case he's got going on, of course, and they shouldn't be confused.
05:08.120 - 05:11.700:  So for instance, we might have seen coverage on the BBC fairly recently
05:12.180 - 05:14.160:  and beyond about another case in Florida.
05:14.400 - 05:15.600:  It's also a federal case.
05:15.660 - 05:18.760:  And Jack Smith, who's the prosecutor in that case,
05:18.760 - 05:23.280:  separately, is the case that relates to documents, classified documents
05:23.280 - 05:24.920:  that it's alleged he shouldn't have held onto.
05:25.360 - 05:28.240:  A court date for a trial has already been set for Florida for
05:28.240 - 05:28.920:  May next year.
05:29.240 - 05:33.660:  That's set pretty again to other charges in New York state,
05:33.700 - 05:37.280:  where it's claimed, again, quite separately to these cases,
05:37.640 - 05:41.460:  that Mr. Trump had been involved in accountancy practices in and around the
05:41.460 - 05:45.740:  hush money was paid to a former adult actress, Stormy Daniel.
05:45.740 - 05:49.260:  So he's got quite the calendar of court cases coming up.
05:49.260 - 05:52.480:  He has, again, called Jack Smith, the prosecutor,
05:52.500 - 05:55.500:  an independent prosecutor for the US government.
05:55.500 - 05:56.740:  He's called him deranged.
05:57.220 - 05:59.980:  And again, he's pointing to claims he's made previously
06:00.460 - 06:04.040:  that the timing of these charges are more related to stopping him
06:04.040 - 06:06.280:  being president than anything to do with justice.
06:06.880 - 06:08.660:  Sean Dilly speaking to me from Washington.
06:09.540 - 06:13.140:  As we record this podcast, the first of three French planes
06:13.180 - 06:15.820:  sent to evacuate European citizens from Niger,
06:15.820 - 06:19.680:  following last week's military coup, has taken off from the capital Niamhme.
06:19.900 - 06:22.220:  The French foreign ministry organized the flights
06:22.620 - 06:25.600:  after demonstrators attacked the French embassy on Sunday.
06:26.220 - 06:29.140:  However, France says it has no plans to repatriate an estimated
06:29.140 - 06:31.340:  1,000 French soldiers stationed there.
06:31.660 - 06:34.920:  They're part of a multinational team that's been countering Islamist
06:34.920 - 06:35.560:  militants.
06:36.020 - 06:38.400:  The generals who seized power have accused France
06:38.400 - 06:41.380:  of planning to intervene to reinstate the elected president
06:41.380 - 06:42.840:  that parasitized this.
06:43.300 - 06:46.860:  Rebecca Kesby spoke to the French MP in Italian Pouserreff,
06:46.860 - 06:49.580:  a member of a Manuel Macron's Renaissance party
06:49.580 - 06:52.820:  and is also on the National Defence and Armed Forces Committee
06:52.820 - 06:54.080:  in the National Assembly.
06:54.560 - 06:56.460:  So what is the scale of the evacuation?
06:57.240 - 06:59.440:  They are, like, hundreds of French nationals
06:59.480 - 07:03.060:  that live in Niamhme because the airspace is closed.
07:03.760 - 07:08.840:  I think there may be no other options than to evacuate them.
07:09.220 - 07:11.440:  Niger got independence in 1960.
07:11.460 - 07:14.440:  Since then, there's been a very close political
07:14.440 - 07:19.680:  relationship, a very strong economic relationship over those years.
07:19.680 - 07:23.780:  But in the past year or so, we've seen increasing hostility
07:23.780 - 07:26.960:  against French assets in the country.
07:26.960 - 07:28.980:  What's gone wrong diplomatically?
07:29.280 - 07:33.140:  Well, I would say that so far the partnership was going well.
07:33.880 - 07:36.500:  Of course, there has been French bashing in the area,
07:37.300 - 07:39.140:  but this is beyond French bashing.
07:39.900 - 07:45.360:  This coup d'état is maybe instrumentalizing the image
07:45.980 - 07:47.280:  that France has in the region,
07:47.880 - 07:51.860:  but we can assume that the reasons behind the coup
07:51.900 - 07:56.300:  are because the president Basoum has dismissed one
07:56.360 - 08:00.460:  of the key leader of the Niger armed force.
08:00.960 - 08:04.260:  Meanwhile, Germany, Italy and Spain have also taken steps
08:04.260 - 08:06.300:  to evacuate their citizens from the country.
08:06.740 - 08:09.200:  Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner, told us more
08:09.200 - 08:10.900:  about the situation in Niger.
08:11.460 - 08:14.300:  It's pretty dire, not just for Western forces,
08:14.740 - 08:15.920:  but for Niger as a whole.
08:17.220 - 08:19.460:  Now, I know there's plenty of people in Niger
08:19.660 - 08:21.660:  who didn't welcome the presence of Western forces,
08:22.460 - 08:23.980:  who said that they weren't doing enough
08:23.980 - 08:27.060:  to combat the jihadist insurances in the region,
08:27.160 - 08:28.160:  like Boca-Haram.
08:29.080 - 08:33.900:  But Niger was getting, has been getting hundreds of millions
08:33.900 - 08:36.500:  of euros in aid, financial assistance,
08:36.500 - 08:38.280:  and military training every year,
08:38.700 - 08:41.120:  from the EU, from the Americans, from the French.
08:41.740 - 08:43.400:  All of that is now drying up.
08:44.040 - 08:47.000:  Now, almost certainly, I would be amazed
08:47.000 - 08:49.080:  if it doesn't happen, Russia will step in.
08:49.600 - 08:52.900:  So this is the third domino after Marley and Boquina Faso
08:53.480 - 08:56.580:  in the Sahel belt, along with Central African Republic,
08:56.580 - 08:59.120:  where Wagner will become the dominant security force.
09:00.020 - 09:02.340:  And I think this, you know, look,
09:02.880 - 09:04.600:  let's try and be open-minded about it.
09:04.840 - 09:07.980:  Maybe it may be, maybe Russia will put lots of aid in.
09:08.340 - 09:10.960:  Maybe they will be able to defeat the insurgents.
09:11.280 - 09:13.260:  But right now, this is looking pretty bad.
09:13.260 - 09:15.600:  And there are no easy options.
09:15.720 - 09:17.340:  And I think it would be wrong to think
09:17.340 - 09:21.960:  that this is the West versus the Junta in Niyamae,
09:22.260 - 09:23.900:  because the whole of Iqawos,
09:24.240 - 09:25.440:  or almost the whole of Iqawos,
09:25.440 - 09:28.060:  that's the economic community of West African states,
09:28.820 - 09:30.920:  are against this push or against this coup.
09:30.920 - 09:32.960:  They've called on them to reverse it, to restore.
09:33.780 - 09:35.820:  After all, the elected president,
09:35.820 - 09:39.000:  he was democratically elected, whatever his faults.
09:39.620 - 09:42.200:  And these bunch that have taken over,
09:42.720 - 09:43.880:  General Tijani and others,
09:44.260 - 09:45.820:  they were not democratically elected.
09:46.280 - 09:47.980:  This is a coup, it's undemocratic.
09:48.700 - 09:50.660:  And it will almost certainly, as I say,
09:50.660 - 09:52.400:  Usher in the Wagner group,
09:52.880 - 09:55.660:  who have a pretty brutal record of suppression
09:56.180 - 09:57.120:  in the Sahel countries.
09:57.740 - 09:59.740:  Insight and analysis from Frank Garner.
10:00.640 - 10:03.580:  Hundreds of staff of Russia's economic development ministry
10:03.580 - 10:05.500:  spent Tuesday working from home,
10:05.500 - 10:08.600:  after a drone struck the skyscraper, housing it.
10:09.100 - 10:11.720:  It was the second such attack in recent days
10:11.720 - 10:13.840:  on the so-called Iqquarter Town
10:13.960 - 10:15.760:  in Central Moscow's business district.
10:16.420 - 10:19.760:  Russia's air defense said the drones flew in direct from Ukraine.
10:20.540 - 10:22.360:  Meanwhile, earlier Russia's defense ministry
10:22.360 - 10:25.000:  said it destroyed three Ukrainian sea drones
10:25.000 - 10:27.640:  that tried to attack two Russian naval ships
10:28.140 - 10:28.900:  in the blank sea.
10:29.460 - 10:31.020:  Ukraine hasn't committed publicly,
10:31.020 - 10:32.740:  but one official in Kiev said
10:33.120 - 10:34.320:  more drones, more collapse,
10:34.320 - 10:36.720:  and more war were coming to Russia.
10:37.320 - 10:39.020:  From Kiev, here's our Ukraine correspondent,
10:39.020 - 10:40.180:  James Waterhouse.
10:40.580 - 10:42.620:  Kiev is warned of the war coming to Russia,
10:42.620 - 10:44.180:  and the last days have suggested,
10:44.540 - 10:45.580:  on the surface at least,
10:45.860 - 10:47.360:  the tide marks avenged closer.
10:47.980 - 10:49.620:  The glossy surroundings of Moscow's
10:49.620 - 10:52.320:  financial district used to be a place which felt far
10:52.700 - 10:54.100:  from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
10:56.980 - 10:59.460:  Two drone strikes involving the same skyscraper
10:59.780 - 11:01.360:  have changed the day-to-day reality
11:01.360 - 11:02.800:  for people like Anastasia.
11:04.520 - 11:06.960:  After the first attack, everyone said
11:06.960 - 11:08.740:  it wouldn't hit the same place twice,
11:09.500 - 11:11.460:  and today we all woke up and were a bit shocked.
11:12.140 - 11:13.400:  I don't know what I'm going to do,
11:13.700 - 11:14.920:  but I think I'll move from here.
11:16.420 - 11:18.440:  Ukraine has been blamed for what the Kremlin calls
11:18.440 - 11:19.560:  a terrorist attack.
11:20.200 - 11:21.980:  It is always hard to say definitively
11:22.000 - 11:23.400:  who is behind strikes like these,
11:23.840 - 11:24.740:  deep inside Russian
11:24.740 - 11:26.940:  or Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.
11:27.700 - 11:29.620:  Professor Justin Bronke is from the Royal United
11:29.620 - 11:30.880:  Services Institute.
11:31.220 - 11:34.560:  Often there's very little surveillance radar actually looking
11:34.560 - 11:36.680:  at the kind of bulk of, in this case,
11:36.920 - 11:40.300:  Russia in-depth before you get to Kiev areas,
11:40.300 - 11:41.240:  like Moscow where, of course,
11:41.240 - 11:42.640:  there are additional layers of defense.
11:42.880 - 11:44.640:  So for a lot of that flight path,
11:44.800 - 11:46.140:  it's actually potentially very difficult
11:46.140 - 11:49.000:  to track those UAVs in real time.
11:49.380 - 11:52.140:  What Kiev has done is war of more attacks to follow,
11:52.140 - 11:54.800:  because of what it describes as Russia's own actions.
11:55.520 - 11:57.540:  There are Russian media reports of an increase
11:57.540 - 12:00.260:  in arson attacks on military recruitment centers.
12:00.960 - 12:02.760:  Last week, the Kremlin raised the age limit
12:02.880 - 12:04.140:  for people to be conscripted
12:04.500 - 12:05.920:  and increased the fine for anyone
12:05.920 - 12:07.420:  trying to resist conscription.
12:08.200 - 12:10.280:  Drones now frequently land on both sides
12:10.280 - 12:11.600:  of the border in this conflict.
12:12.060 - 12:15.500:  Only with Ukraine, dozens of civilians die every week.
12:15.880 - 12:17.100:  That was James Waterhouse.
12:17.100 - 12:19.800:  While the Ukraine conflict seems to have taken the world
12:19.800 - 12:21.600:  into a new era of drone warfare
12:22.140 - 12:23.800:  with both sides now using them.
12:24.300 - 12:26.560:  Evan Davis spoke to Francisco Sardomattens
12:26.560 - 12:28.280:  who runs one-way aerospace,
12:28.280 - 12:31.600:  which builds and supplies drones to Ukraine.
12:32.260 - 12:35.060:  We work with two ministries providing
12:35.560 - 12:36.840:  a short-range kamikaze drones,
12:36.840 - 12:37.980:  which we call Scapples.
12:38.520 - 12:40.300:  So these are used by infantrymen
12:40.360 - 12:42.700:  to engage enemy armor and enemy infantry.
12:43.300 - 12:45.980:  And we're also developing a long-range kamikaze solution.
12:45.980 - 12:48.200:  So it's 750 kilometer range,
12:48.560 - 12:49.460:  keep the Moscow range,
12:49.800 - 12:52.420:  which can deliver precisely 43 kilograms.
12:52.620 - 12:54.580:  So on board, it has two artillery rounds.
12:54.580 - 12:56.820:  So we're working with local partners
12:56.820 - 12:58.760:  to mass-produce the system in Ukraine
12:58.760 - 13:00.220:  and over the next few weeks, hopefully,
13:01.000 - 13:03.180:  you'll see it deployed within occupied Ukraine
13:03.320 - 13:04.380:  and elsewhere as well.
13:04.660 - 13:06.040:  Right. So just to be clear,
13:06.260 - 13:08.020:  in Ukraine, you were building drones
13:08.060 - 13:09.540:  that could be launched in Kiev
13:10.040 - 13:11.140:  and could strike Moscow.
13:11.660 - 13:14.160:  Correct. You could deploy from within Ukraine
13:14.160 - 13:17.100:  and hit anywhere basically up to Moscow and beyond.
13:17.340 - 13:19.400:  And one of those longer-range drones,
13:19.440 - 13:20.720:  just describe it to me.
13:20.720 - 13:22.480:  How big is this thing we're talking about?
13:22.640 - 13:25.980:  So it's 2.3 meters with all the electronics on board,
13:25.980 - 13:27.260:  which enable to fly under jamming.
13:27.260 - 13:28.660:  It's a very quite a cheap platform.
13:28.660 - 13:31.400:  It's about 24,000, 25,000 US dollars.
13:31.560 - 13:34.760:  And so it means we can produce on mass, scale quite quickly,
13:35.180 - 13:36.920:  an affordable kinetic structure
13:36.920 - 13:39.920:  and that can hit pretty much anywhere within occupied Ukraine,
13:39.920 - 13:42.180:  but also into strategic sites within Russia as well.
13:42.320 - 13:45.060:  And the MOD, the Ministry of Defence in Kiev,
13:45.060 - 13:46.320:  the Ukrainian Defence,
13:46.320 - 13:48.700:  is it a client of yours, a customer of yours?
13:48.700 - 13:50.040:  Are they buying them now?
13:50.040 - 13:52.940:  Or is there something you will be doing
13:53.460 - 13:54.940:  and will be providing in future?
13:55.120 - 13:57.240:  We don't comment directly on end uses,
13:57.240 - 13:59.700:  but basically there's a process of tests
13:59.700 - 14:00.440:  that has to be conducted,
14:00.440 - 14:02.080:  which also includes a kinetic testing.
14:02.560 - 14:03.440:  So until that's conducted,
14:03.780 - 14:04.840:  then the procurement will be complete.
14:04.980 - 14:06.600:  But we haven't completed that entire process yet,
14:06.720 - 14:08.620:  but we should have in the next few weeks, I imagine.
14:08.840 - 14:11.780:  Francisco, are you a regulated business in some way?
14:11.800 - 14:13.640:  I mean, can you just sell your drones,
14:13.640 - 14:15.900:  which obviously can be quite a weapon?
14:16.020 - 14:17.480:  You can't just sell them to anyone.
14:17.740 - 14:20.160:  No, I mean, so UK export licensing
14:20.680 - 14:22.580:  only limits for things that are sensitive in nature,
14:22.580 - 14:23.620:  so like nuclear weapons,
14:24.200 - 14:25.120:  satellites and so forth.
14:25.500 - 14:27.720:  So technically, you could sell these systems
14:27.720 - 14:30.600:  to other countries relatively and flexibly.
14:30.700 - 14:31.920:  But from Ukraine, it's rather difficult
14:31.920 - 14:32.960:  because there's this time of war,
14:32.960 - 14:34.640:  and these are considered a defence article
14:34.640 - 14:35.800:  by Ukrainian standards.
14:36.340 - 14:37.120:  But by UK standards,
14:37.120 - 14:39.120:  it doesn't cross the threshold of as a weapon
14:39.120 - 14:41.040:  because it doesn't actually contain a defence article.
14:41.220 - 14:42.600:  But the UK is actually very permissive,
14:42.680 - 14:43.980:  so to even get a next spot last
14:43.980 - 14:45.740:  since only a few weeks, it's actually quite easy.
14:46.140 - 14:49.260:  Francisco Seramantins from the one-way aerospace company.
14:50.420 - 14:52.880:  Since the mass protests in Iran last year,
14:52.880 - 14:53.900:  hundreds of young,
14:53.900 - 14:55.980:  injured protesters have fled the country
14:55.980 - 14:57.780:  in the hope of treatments somewhere else.
14:58.400 - 14:59.520:  Three months ago, Simar,
14:59.700 - 15:01.140:  with her three-year-old daughter,
15:01.140 - 15:04.300:  escaped Iran and found refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan.
15:04.920 - 15:06.700:  But Iraqi doctors say they're not equipped
15:06.700 - 15:07.860:  to deal with her injuries.
15:08.460 - 15:09.820:  The station needs to go into a country
15:09.820 - 15:11.220:  with advanced medical facilities,
15:11.420 - 15:13.420:  and have warned that if infection in Simar's arm
15:13.420 - 15:14.000:  continues,
15:14.480 - 15:15.600:  it might have to be amputated.
15:15.960 - 15:18.780:  The BBC's Jargal met Simar in Iraqi Kurdistan.
15:21.960 - 15:25.840:  A mountainous terrain lies between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan.
15:27.140 - 15:29.360:  A route reddled with land mines
15:29.880 - 15:31.800:  and petrolled by Iranian forces
15:32.080 - 15:33.980:  who don't hesitate to shoot.
15:34.880 - 15:37.540:  I'm driving from Soleimania,
15:37.820 - 15:39.840:  a major Kurdish city in northern Iraq
15:40.320 - 15:42.540:  to a village near the Iranian border.
15:43.320 - 15:44.460:  In the past few months,
15:45.060 - 15:47.580:  tens of young injured Iranian protesters
15:48.320 - 15:49.800:  have crossed the border on foot,
15:50.600 - 15:52.240:  and they have come to Iraqi Kurdistan
15:52.920 - 15:54.220:  to deal with their wounds.
15:56.580 - 15:58.420:  Simar Moratbegi, 26,
15:58.900 - 16:00.620:  is one of the injured protesters
16:01.180 - 16:03.000:  recently under the cover of darkness,
16:03.560 - 16:05.160:  fled Iran with her daughter,
16:05.920 - 16:08.480:  and found refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan.
16:10.520 - 16:12.160:  For three grueling hours,
16:12.160 - 16:14.940:  we walked through a heavy rain and thick mud.
16:15.280 - 16:17.360:  I was forced to give my daughter a sleeping pill
16:17.380 - 16:18.020:  for the journey,
16:18.520 - 16:19.920:  ensuring a noiseless trip.
16:21.820 - 16:23.420:  In mid-September last year,
16:23.700 - 16:25.100:  Mahsajina Amini,
16:25.320 - 16:28.040:  a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman,
16:28.520 - 16:29.980:  was detained in Tehran
16:29.980 - 16:33.940:  for allegedly violating strict Islamic dress code.
16:34.800 - 16:36.800:  Her death in police custody
16:37.380 - 16:39.420:  sparked mass protests in Iran.
16:39.820 - 16:41.760:  In Mardom, Amidwa, Buda, and Harul
16:41.760 - 16:43.380:  despite numerous arrests,
16:44.240 - 16:45.060:  injuries and deaths,
16:45.760 - 16:46.980:  people didn't retreat.
16:47.900 - 16:48.460:  We were hopeful.
16:48.600 - 16:49.700:  She died, but he is on one.
16:53.660 - 16:54.400:  Nine months ago,
16:54.540 - 16:55.940:  in the Kurdish city of Bukhan,
16:55.940 - 16:57.240:  in northwest of Iran,
16:57.720 - 16:59.020:  Iranian security forces
16:59.400 - 17:02.180:  fired 300 bird-shot pellets
17:02.620 - 17:03.160:  at SEMA,
17:03.800 - 17:05.700:  causing severe injuries.
17:15.700 - 17:18.020:  SEMA was rushed to the city's hospital,
17:18.440 - 17:21.720:  where the police and intelligence agents were lurking.
17:24.080 - 17:25.560:  I could hear NASA shouting
17:25.560 - 17:27.920:  she needs a blood transfusion.
17:29.120 - 17:31.760:  At Miss Diagency and Islamic Revolutionary Guard
17:31.920 - 17:32.320:  shouted,
17:32.700 - 17:34.100:  for her out of the hospital,
17:34.100 - 17:35.720:  I could hear everything.
17:35.720 - 17:37.100:  I struggled to say,
17:37.500 - 17:38.300:  don't let me die,
17:38.900 - 17:40.040:  yet I couldn't talk.
17:43.280 - 17:46.000:  Taken SEMA to a private hospital in another city,
17:46.380 - 17:48.060:  her family remained anxious.
17:48.900 - 17:52.120:  Fearing the regime agents might arrest her
17:52.180 - 17:53.320:  on her hospital bed,
17:53.760 - 17:55.120:  to save God SEMA,
17:55.460 - 17:57.820:  the doctor recorded her injuries
17:58.220 - 17:59.280:  as a car accident.
18:00.920 - 18:03.160:  I could only sleep two or three hours a night,
18:03.600 - 18:05.820:  with my dreams transferred into a
18:06.040 - 18:06.980:  relentless nightmare,
18:07.180 - 18:09.220:  haunted by the sound of gunshots.
18:16.340 - 18:18.560:  SEMA shows me an X-ray of her hand.
18:19.320 - 18:23.020:  Around 200 white dots could be seen.
18:23.680 - 18:25.480:  They are bird-shot pellets
18:25.840 - 18:27.340:  remained in her hand.
18:28.620 - 18:31.440:  SEMA has multiple open fractures with her elbow,
18:31.920 - 18:33.320:  bearing severe damage.
18:34.040 - 18:37.400:  The pellets caused significant tissue destruction.
18:39.040 - 18:42.520:  Despite SEMA's physical and psychological wounds,
18:42.520 - 18:44.040:  defiantly she says,
18:44.620 - 18:48.480:  she would protest against the Islamic regime all over again.
18:48.980 - 18:52.940:  I was warned for the sake of my daughter I shouldn't protest.
18:52.940 - 18:57.580:  I always replied I protest for the better future for my daughter.
18:58.100 - 19:02.480:  Iraqi Kurdistan doctors say SEMA needs immediate cure
19:02.480 - 19:06.220:  in a country with advanced medical facilities.
19:06.880 - 19:09.740:  They were worried if her infection continues,
19:10.480 - 19:12.520:  they have to amputate her arm.
19:13.220 - 19:16.040:  That report by GIGOL in Iraqi Kurdistan.
19:18.980 - 19:19.560:  Still to come?
19:19.940 - 19:23.680:  We know that exposure to high altitude could have some effects.
19:24.140 - 19:25.760:  For instance, headache,
19:25.760 - 19:27.640:  increasing your heart rate,
19:27.960 - 19:30.720:  and your blood pressure, some nausea.
19:31.060 - 19:33.440:  So how do millions of people around the world
19:33.440 - 19:35.780:  climateize to working at high altitude?
19:36.400 - 19:37.060:  Find out later.
19:45.000 - 19:45.760:  Hey, babe, what you got there?
19:45.880 - 19:47.260:  This is a check from Carvana.
19:47.400 - 19:48.360:  I just sold my car to them.
19:48.480 - 19:50.420:  I went online and Carvana gave me an offer right away.
19:50.420 - 19:52.480:  Then they just picked up the car and gave me this.
19:53.100 - 19:54.280:  Well, that's a big check.
19:54.420 - 19:56.520:  Well, obviously you could put this towards your next car,
19:56.680 - 19:58.440:  or we could finally get that jacuzzi,
19:58.440 - 20:00.340:  or I could start taking tuba lessons,
20:00.340 - 20:02.900:  or I could quit my job and write my memoir.
20:03.100 - 20:05.400:  Or I can put it towards my next car with Carvana.
20:05.580 - 20:07.260:  Sorry, your check, not mine.
20:07.500 - 20:08.860:  Sell your car to Carvana.
20:09.040 - 20:11.400:  Visit Carvana.com or download the app
20:11.400 - 20:12.820:  to get a real offer in seconds.
20:19.520 - 20:20.520:  Hi, I'm Hannah.
20:20.520 - 20:23.160:  I am the host of a new daily podcast,
20:23.160 - 20:25.680:  What in the World from the BBC World Service,
20:26.140 - 20:29.260:  where we try to help you make sense of the world around you,
20:29.780 - 20:30.860:  explaining the big events,
20:31.320 - 20:32.620:  and some of the smaller events,
20:33.200 - 20:34.900:  so that you might feel a little bit better
20:34.900 - 20:37.320:  when you pick up your phone and scroll through your newsfeed.
20:39.280 - 20:40.840:  Just search for What in the World,
20:41.160 - 20:42.860:  wherever you get your BBC podcasts,
20:43.460 - 20:44.140:  and hit subscribe.
20:46.820 - 20:50.340:  And this year, there's been a growing number of migrants
20:50.340 - 20:54.180:  crossing the perilous Darian gap between Panama and Colombia,
20:54.700 - 20:57.180:  a record 250,000 people
20:57.180 - 20:58.880:  undertook the journey through the jungle
20:59.220 - 21:01.360:  where South America meets Central America.
21:02.040 - 21:03.480:  This is despite recent efforts
21:03.480 - 21:05.480:  by regional governments and the U.S.
21:05.480 - 21:07.160:  to curb the flow of migrants.
21:07.860 - 21:09.260:  On Latin America, regional editor,
21:09.260 - 21:11.640:  Mimi Swaby told me more about the Darian gap.
21:12.120 - 21:14.520:  This is one of the most dangerous
21:14.880 - 21:16.600:  pastures for migration in the world.
21:16.600 - 21:19.020:  It's about 106 kilometres long
21:19.400 - 21:23.200:  through really dense, unrooted, thick jungle.
21:23.740 - 21:26.660:  And this is a minefield for dangerous snakes,
21:26.660 - 21:28.540:  another predator, slippery rocks,
21:29.200 - 21:30.300:  erratic riverbeds,
21:30.300 - 21:32.540:  which are really challenging to navigate for adults,
21:32.540 - 21:35.320:  let alone children who are increasingly making up
21:35.340 - 21:37.800:  the number of these individuals passing through,
21:37.800 - 21:39.920:  currently about 20% are thought to be miners,
21:40.380 - 21:41.880:  and half of those are under five.
21:42.420 - 21:43.940:  So those are the natural elements
21:43.940 - 21:45.180:  which cause a lot of danger.
21:45.180 - 21:47.580:  But then you've also got gangs and other armed groups
21:47.580 - 21:49.400:  who occupy a lot of this area
21:49.820 - 21:52.000:  who are making millions off individuals
21:52.000 - 21:54.920:  through trafficking and smuggling methods,
21:55.720 - 21:57.980:  making the way from South and Central America,
21:58.400 - 22:00.900:  trying to get up to that U.S.-Mexico border.
22:01.640 - 22:03.420:  Considering the physical, the natural,
22:03.420 - 22:05.080:  and the human hazards,
22:05.900 - 22:08.860:  why has the number of migrants increased this year?
22:09.700 - 22:12.800:  There are as many reasons as there are migrants.
22:12.840 - 22:16.060:  Everybody has their own individual reason.
22:16.800 - 22:19.780:  But the majority of these migrants are coming from
22:20.480 - 22:21.900:  Venezuela, Haiti, and Ecuador.
22:22.420 - 22:25.220:  And for example, in Haiti there is a humanitarian crisis,
22:25.220 - 22:28.140:  a security crisis, and a political vacuum.
22:28.140 - 22:30.740:  So it's a real push factors trying to leave the country,
22:30.740 - 22:32.120:  and thousands are trying to flee.
22:32.500 - 22:33.860:  And there's a similar story of Venezuela
22:33.860 - 22:36.440:  where political turmoil is leaving many
22:36.440 - 22:37.600:  under the poverty line,
22:37.980 - 22:39.300:  really struggling economically.
22:39.820 - 22:41.480:  So there are lots of push factors,
22:41.480 - 22:44.200:  then also a lot of confusion about migration policies
22:44.680 - 22:45.800:  earlier in the year in April,
22:46.360 - 22:47.700:  the title of 42 ended.
22:47.880 - 22:49.060:  And that was an emergency measure
22:49.280 - 22:51.340:  brought in by former U.S. President Donald Trump
22:51.960 - 22:55.200:  to basically allow the immediate removal of migrants.
22:55.200 - 22:57.460:  No questions asked due to the pandemic starting.
22:57.660 - 22:59.080:  So it's decided under health reasons.
22:59.700 - 23:00.640:  So when that came to an end,
23:00.640 - 23:02.340:  a lot of people were given misinformation
23:02.340 - 23:05.600:  about if they could come, if they were allowed to be in the country.
23:05.600 - 23:06.320:  There's a lot of confusion
23:06.320 - 23:08.160:  for human traffickers, smugglers,
23:08.160 - 23:10.040:  really capitalized on that confusion,
23:10.500 - 23:14.000:  allowing people to believe with a lot of fake false hope
23:14.000 - 23:16.360:  that they would be able to get to the U.S.
23:16.700 - 23:17.760:  perhaps through the daring gap
23:17.800 - 23:19.140:  and make a life for themselves there.
23:19.500 - 23:20.940:  The voice there of Mimi Swaby.
23:21.740 - 23:24.180:  The United Arab Emirates is reportedly offering
23:24.180 - 23:27.100:  to treble the salaries of Israeli doctors
23:27.100 - 23:28.900:  if they move to the Gulf state.
23:29.540 - 23:32.000:  It follows a one-day strike by Israeli doctors
23:32.000 - 23:35.020:  over the passing of contentious legal reforms in Israel,
23:35.460 - 23:37.220:  which many believe will damage democracy.
23:37.780 - 23:38.460:  Here's Mike Thompson.
23:38.980 - 23:43.260:  More than 3,000 of them are said to have joined a social media chat group
23:43.580 - 23:45.840:  seeking advice on relocating abroad.
23:46.480 - 23:48.920:  Many have voiced deep concerns about a law
23:48.920 - 23:52.400:  passed last week that limits the power of the Supreme Court
23:52.400 - 23:54.140:  to challenge government decisions.
23:54.180 - 23:57.120:  In addition to tripling the doctor's salaries,
23:57.520 - 24:00.800:  the UAE is also reported to be offering so-called
24:01.020 - 24:01.840:  golden visas,
24:02.240 - 24:04.060:  allowing them long-term residency.
24:04.660 - 24:08.180:  The Emirates normalized relations with Israel three years ago
24:08.740 - 24:09.460:  Mike Thompson there.
24:10.040 - 24:11.940:  The popular right-hailing app Uber
24:11.940 - 24:15.340:  has posted its first ever quarterly operating profits
24:15.340 - 24:17.560:  since launching back in 2009.
24:18.320 - 24:20.860:  It attributed the surprise result to strong growth
24:20.860 - 24:23.220:  in its core mobility and delivery businesses.
24:23.220 - 24:25.620:  Michelle Flurry reports from New York.
24:26.100 - 24:28.680:  This marks a significant milestone for Uber,
24:28.680 - 24:30.620:  which has spent heavily to grow its business
24:31.060 - 24:32.860:  over the 14 years since it was founded.
24:33.340 - 24:36.080:  The ride-aiding company reported its first ever
24:36.080 - 24:39.020:  operating profit of $326 million.
24:40.020 - 24:43.980:  A far cry from the $713 million loss a year earlier.
24:44.620 - 24:48.960:  It also generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow during the last three months.
24:49.500 - 24:51.680:  The results show that despite high inflation
24:51.680 - 24:53.380:  in many countries where it operates,
24:53.380 - 24:56.180:  customers are still willing to pay for the convenience
24:56.180 - 24:59.240:  of hailing a ride and getting food delivered to their door.
24:59.640 - 25:01.880:  The number of trips taken hit an all-time high.
25:02.320 - 25:03.060:  Michelle Flurry.
25:03.720 - 25:07.420:  Around the world, from Tibet to the Andes to the Ethiopian Highlands,
25:07.460 - 25:09.820:  millions of people work at high altitude.
25:10.500 - 25:14.380:  It used to be the case that most people who worked in the mountains were from there.
25:14.420 - 25:16.540:  They lived and worked close to where they were born.
25:17.220 - 25:20.220:  But in this modern globalized world of mass migration,
25:20.220 - 25:22.200:  more and more people are working in environments
25:22.200 - 25:24.280:  that their bodies are not accustomed to.
25:24.840 - 25:28.280:  The BBC's Gideon Long has been asking what that means for their health.
25:32.140 - 25:32.620:  Good morning.
25:33.180 - 25:34.600:  My name is Leonardo Espos.
25:35.000 - 25:37.060:  I've been working at Escondida for 10 years.
25:44.980 - 25:47.440:  Those are just two of the workers at Escondida,
25:47.440 - 25:49.360:  the largest copper mine in the world.
25:50.080 - 25:55.300:  It's in Chile and it's at 3,100 meters above sea level in the Andes mountains.
25:56.000 - 25:57.940:  That's over 10,000 feet up.
25:58.600 - 26:01.520:  To give you an idea that's higher than the highest peak in Germany,
26:01.520 - 26:06.640:  it's higher than Mount Olympus in Greece and higher than anywhere in mainland Australia.
26:07.480 - 26:11.580:  Leonardo and Caroline are among 150 million people worldwide
26:11.580 - 26:17.800:  who work at high altitude, generally defined by medics as 2,500 meters or above.
26:18.680 - 26:21.660:  I've been talking to doctors about what all this means for workers
26:22.360 - 26:23.960:  and the companies that employ them.
26:24.400 - 26:26.240:  My name is Jacqueline Pichler.
26:26.440 - 26:30.320:  I'm from Switzerland working as a pulmonologist
26:30.320 - 26:31.900:  for now, several years.
26:32.320 - 26:34.140:  My name is Alberto Pacheco.
26:34.360 - 26:39.360:  I am the head of health for minerals America at BHP.
26:39.700 - 26:44.880:  BHP, the company that Alberto works for, owns and operates the Escondida mine.
26:45.620 - 26:49.360:  We know that exposure to high altitude could have some effects.
26:49.800 - 26:52.920:  For instance, the high altitude mountain sickness
26:53.280 - 26:57.080:  when you have a headache, increase in your heartbreak,
26:57.080 - 27:02.480:  and your blood pressure, some nausea, problems to have a good sleep,
27:02.500 - 27:06.480:  and it will depend on what level of altitude are you exposed to.
27:06.740 - 27:11.340:  The main challenge for the body is the reduced oxygen availability.
27:11.500 - 27:13.360:  The heart rate is increasing,
27:14.200 - 27:18.200:  so people who work at altitude, they have reduced performance,
27:19.020 - 27:21.980:  and especially where they have to work hard,
27:22.060 - 27:25.880:  like physically hard, this is very limiting.
27:28.780 - 27:29.180:  Hello, how are you?
27:31.080 - 27:36.340:  At Escondida, Alberto Pacheco and BHP are responsible for thousands of employees.
27:37.540 - 27:40.320:  So what should these workers do once they finish their shifts,
27:41.000 - 27:45.940:  come back down to the lowlands to get some oxygen rich air, or stay where they are?
27:46.680 - 27:50.000:  The vast majority of the earth is 7 by 7 shifts,
27:50.360 - 27:53.780:  so 7 days are the mine, 7 days off.
27:54.120 - 27:59.640:  Is that because that has been established and recognized as best practice,
27:59.760 - 28:01.480:  rather than going up and down every day?
28:02.260 - 28:04.220:  Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
28:04.220 - 28:10.060:  If you are 7 days at altitude, you have a level of acclimatation to altitude,
28:10.580 - 28:15.060:  and if you are 7 days at low altitude, you don't lose your acclimatation.
28:15.440 - 28:18.700:  It is possible to live and work healthily at high altitude,
28:19.240 - 28:20.860:  but you do have to make a bit more effort.
28:21.740 - 28:25.860:  Here are Leonardo and Caroline, those two workers at Escondida.
28:31.880 - 28:35.000:  Working at around 3,000 meters has been a good experience for me.
28:35.580 - 28:38.960:  In all the years I have been working here, I have never had any problems with the altitude,
28:39.680 - 28:43.360:  but that also depends on each person looking after themselves when they are not working,
28:43.360 - 28:45.660:  taking care of food, with exercise.
28:45.780 - 28:49.400:  It is essential to stay in good shape at this altitude.
28:57.680 - 29:00.500:  My experience of working at altitude has been really good.
29:00.500 - 29:02.380:  I don't have any problems with it.
29:03.120 - 29:06.200:  My way of taking care of myself is by sleeping well,
29:06.900 - 29:10.260:  being careful with my food, and doing exercise at the weekend.
29:10.260 - 29:15.400:  When I am not at the mine, I also sleep well, I do things to relax,
29:15.400 - 29:16.900:  including doing exercises.
29:20.580 - 29:25.500:  For companies operating at altitude, it must be incredibly expensive to look after their staff.
29:25.500 - 29:28.420:  All those medical checks, doctors, nurses,
29:28.960 - 29:33.020:  on-site ambulances, especially designed bedrooms so people can sleep at night.
29:33.860 - 29:36.920:  I asked BHP's Alberto Pacheco about the cost.
29:37.320 - 29:43.260:  Well, obviously it's not cheap, but really the most important asset is the people,
29:43.660 - 29:46.260:  so if we have to spend money, we will spend.
29:47.060 - 29:48.620:  That report by Gideon Long.
29:49.240 - 29:51.060:  Now a message from Mission Control.
30:02.560 - 30:06.500:  An excerpt there of the song Space Audity by David Bowie,
30:06.500 - 30:11.560:  the danger of a spacecraft losing contact with planet Earth has long been established
30:11.560 - 30:13.320:  in our interstellar consciousness.
30:14.020 - 30:17.000:  Something goes wrong and an astronaut floats off into the void.
30:17.480 - 30:22.060:  Well, nothing so drastic this time, but after sending the wrong command,
30:22.060 - 30:25.960:  NASA lost contact with Voyager 2, raising fears of trouble.
30:26.460 - 30:29.280:  Now though, the craft has signaled that it's in good health.
30:29.480 - 30:30.660:  Terry Egan reports.
30:31.340 - 30:34.880:  Voyager 2 has been exploring space since 1977,
30:34.880 - 30:38.220:  making it nearly 46 years into its mission,
30:38.760 - 30:45.020:  laden with science instruments and hurtling at more than 55,000 kilometers per hour through the stars,
30:45.020 - 30:48.440:  it's almost 20 billion kilometers from Earth.
30:48.940 - 30:53.900:  At that distance, 18 hours are needed for any signal to reach us.
30:54.540 - 31:01.060:  But last month, the craft was sent to mistaken command and it tilted its antenna to point two
31:01.060 - 31:03.000:  degrees away from Earth.
31:03.480 - 31:06.700:  As a result, the probe stopped sending data,
31:07.140 - 31:13.460:  data that should make its way to an array of giant radio antenna spread out across the world.
31:26.340 - 31:31.040:  Voyager 2 is the only craft ever to fly by Neptune and Uranus.
31:31.040 - 31:37.620:  Like its twin Voyager 1, it carries a golden record with Earth's sounds, pictures and messages
31:38.100 - 31:42.000:  to tell our story in case it's found by extraterrestrials.
31:42.660 - 31:48.760:  On Tuesday, officials said they had detected what they called a heartbeat signal from Voyager 2,
31:49.080 - 31:51.040:  so they know it's still in operation.
31:51.760 - 31:56.240:  They will continue to bombard the vicinity of Voyager 2 with the correct command,
31:56.740 - 31:58.780:  hoping to reposition the antenna.
31:59.560 - 32:06.280:  If all else fails, the craft is programmed to reset its orientation multiple times each year
32:06.580 - 32:09.560:  in order to keep its antenna pointing at Earth,
32:09.900 - 32:13.300:  and the next reset is due on October the 15th.
32:13.740 - 32:19.900:  In the meantime, the probe is expected to remain on its planned trajectory through the universe.
32:21.520 - 32:24.560:  That report by Terry Egan here, back down on Earth.
32:27.420 - 32:31.300:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast
32:31.300 - 32:35.320:  a little later on. If you want to come in on this one or any of the topics covered in it,
32:35.320 - 32:40.220:  do send us an email, the address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk.
32:40.220 - 32:43.880:  You can also find us on Twitter at Global News Pod.
32:44.460 - 32:46.540:  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll.
32:46.540 - 32:49.620:  The producer was Liam McSheffrey. The editor is always Karam Martin.
32:50.100 - 32:52.400:  I'm Gareth Barlow, and until next time, goodbye.
