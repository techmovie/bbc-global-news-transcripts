00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:12.540:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
00:13.320 - 00:17.360:  Excitement here in New Zealand has been ignited for this tournament.
00:17.620 - 00:20.960:  Hearing our fans being behind us is just unforgettable.

00:37.180 - 00:40.700:  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Friday the 4th of August,
00:40.700 - 00:46.720:  these are our main stories. Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to four charges at a court in
00:46.720 - 00:52.720:  Washington, including conspiring to overturn the result of the 2020 US presidential election.
00:53.380 - 00:58.240:  Satellite data from Brazil shows deforestation in the Amazon has dropped dramatically.
00:58.980 - 01:02.340:  A man has stabbed more than a dozen people in South Korea.
01:04.860 - 01:11.500:  Also in this podcast, we've took this bacteria which we had isolated and we infected these mosquitoes
01:12.100 - 01:17.740:  with the malaria parasite and we found that it was the one responsible for reducing infection
01:17.740 - 01:23.580:  in these mosquitoes. Scientists have found a natural strain of bacteria which they say could help
01:23.580 - 01:27.520:  stop the transmission of malaria from mosquitoes to humans.
01:31.580 - 01:36.100:  The former US president, Donald Trump, has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges
01:36.560 - 01:42.220:  that he conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election and defraud the American people.
01:42.940 - 01:47.200:  He entered his plea in the same Washington court house where hundreds of his supporters were
01:47.200 - 01:53.760:  convicted for their rules in the attack on the US Capitol in January 2021. Mr. Trump,
01:53.760 - 01:58.120:  the front runner for the Republican presidential nomination next year, said it was
01:58.120 - 02:04.120:  a very sad day for America. Reporting from Washington is our correspondent, Shondali.
02:04.600 - 02:08.820:  Donald Trump arrived at court with a secret service motorcade after flying in
02:08.820 - 02:14.700:  from his bedmints to golf resort in New Jersey. Dressed in a dark suit, blue shirt and trademark
02:14.700 - 02:19.900:  red tie, he entered the courtroom accompanied by his lawyers without speaking to reporters.
02:20.280 - 02:26.600:  He listened intently as the prosecution read out the charges. Mr. Trump was asked to enter a plea,
02:26.600 - 02:33.640:  denying all charges, he said slowly and deliberately not guilty. Prosecutors did not oppose bail,
02:33.640 - 02:38.480:  which the judge granted, but she told him not to talk about the facts of the case.
02:38.900 - 02:43.420:  Failure to comply with this condition she said could result in an arrest warrant being issued,
02:43.420 - 02:49.900:  contempt of court charges and potential custody. Mr. Trump was driven straight from the courts to
02:49.900 - 02:56.360:  the nearby Reagan airport where he spoke to reporters. This is a persecution of a political opponent.
02:56.880 - 03:02.400:  This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's
03:02.780 - 03:09.040:  leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot.
03:09.800 - 03:14.640:  So if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him, we can't let this happen
03:14.640 - 03:20.980:  in America. Donald Trump's next court date is the 28th of August. The former president has been told
03:20.980 - 03:28.100:  he doesn't have to attend. Sean Dilly in Washington. Michael Gerhardt is a constitutional lawyer
03:28.460 - 03:32.320:  and distinguished professor of jurisprudence at the University of North Carolina,
03:32.320 - 03:37.940:  who testified at Donald Trump's impeachment proceedings and also at the process involving Bill
03:38.460 - 03:44.400:  Clinton. Rebecca Kessby asked him if this latest case is more important than any of the other cases
03:44.400 - 03:51.020:  that Mr. Trump has faced so far. I think they're all important or another way to think of it as they're
03:51.100 - 03:57.400:  they're each becoming increasingly important. John Adams once talked about how this is a country
03:57.400 - 04:03.240:  of government. We have a government of laws not men and that's what's being tested because
04:03.240 - 04:08.780:  the law should apply to everyone equally and Trump seems to based on the evidence that has
04:08.780 - 04:16.980:  been amassed to engage in a series of acts that were designed to impede the peaceful transfer of
04:16.980 - 04:22.480:  power in the United States. That's been a bedrock principle here in the United States that the
04:22.480 - 04:30.080:  loser sort of kind of acknowledges that and then goes away. Doesn't try to create any kind of
04:30.320 - 04:36.960:  violence or rebellion or any kind of havoc in the aftermath of election. Mr. Trump obviously
04:36.960 - 04:42.360:  did just the opposite. Can you tell us anything else about how this trial may be conducted?
04:42.400 - 04:46.840:  Is it going to be televised? Will there be a jury if it's a grand jury? What does that mean?
04:47.640 - 04:52.420:  It will not be a grand jury. So the grand jury's function in our legal system is to charge
04:52.420 - 04:57.220:  somebody with a crime. That's already been done. So now the ball sort of goes into the court of the
04:57.220 - 05:02.800:  federal district judge. It's going to oversee Trump's trial and then all those questions are
05:02.800 - 05:08.620:  really left for her to answer. Will she allow television into the courtroom, when, if at all,
05:08.620 - 05:14.520:  would she do that? She will oversee the selection of a jury which is supposed to include people that
05:14.520 - 05:19.440:  don't already have prejudices about this matter. She's going to be a tough judge. That's her
05:19.440 - 05:24.800:  reputation and I mean that in the best sense. She doesn't take any nonsense. She's been tough on
05:24.800 - 05:29.320:  people that have come before her in the past who participated in the riots at the capital.
05:29.320 - 05:34.640:  She's handed out tough sentences but she also came to the her judgment from having been a public
05:34.640 - 05:40.080:  defender and that means she's very aware of and sensitive to the rights of criminal defendants.
05:40.340 - 05:45.820:  And she'll be even handed but in Mr. Trump's case that might not be welcome. He wants somebody
05:45.820 - 05:50.360:  who's already sort of biased in his favor. He doesn't have that here. Interesting. Michael just a
05:50.360 - 05:55.980:  quick word on what we know of the other co-conspirators. What can you tell us about that? Well, these are
05:55.980 - 06:00.980:  all people who really work for Mr. Trump in the administration. So there are fellow Democrats,
06:00.980 - 06:06.520:  there are people he appointing to positions of power. So this is not a conspiracy. So speak of
06:06.520 - 06:12.840:  Democrats that are kind of going after Mr. Trump. Instead, it's his fellow Republicans are the ones
06:12.840 - 06:19.360:  that helped him attempt to undermine the election and also people that had high ranking positions.
06:19.360 - 06:24.900:  The acting attorney general in the United States is among them. It's a very serious problem
06:24.900 - 06:31.640:  that these six co-conspirators were all people that wield enormous power but they did his bidding
06:31.660 - 06:37.780:  in trying to impede the peaceful transfer power. The constitutional lawyer, Michael Gerhardt.
06:38.600 - 06:43.160:  When President Lillard Silva returned to power in Brazil in January, he promised to reverse the
06:43.160 - 06:49.380:  damage down to the rainforest by his predecessor, Jaya Bolsonaro. Official figures from Brazil's
06:49.380 - 06:54.560:  space research agency seem to show he's on the right track as I heard from our correspondent in
06:54.560 - 07:01.180:  Brazil, Kitty Watson. In Pei, which is the Brazilian space research agency, they monitor the
07:01.180 - 07:07.040:  Amazon through satellites and they said that in the month of July, 500 square kilometers of
07:07.040 - 07:13.040:  rainforest was cleared and that's a 66% drop from the same period a year ago. And even if you
07:13.040 - 07:18.340:  look at the first seven months of this year compared to the seven months of last year, deforestation
07:18.380 - 07:27.600:  has fallen 42.5%. So these are massive, massive drops in the first half of 2023 since Lillard
07:27.600 - 07:34.200:  Silva came back to be Brazil's president. And how has he done it? If you look at the surveillance
07:34.200 - 07:40.660:  that's gone up. So during Jaya Bolsonaro's time in power, he cut resources which meant the
07:40.660 - 07:46.020:  weren't as many people on the ground in terms of finding people who did things that they shouldn't
07:46.020 - 07:51.440:  be doing in the Amazon like deforesting or planting things they shouldn't or putting cattle on land
07:51.560 - 07:56.040:  that they shouldn't be doing that. He's increased that surveillance. In fact, the amount of fines
07:56.040 - 08:05.620:  rose 150% of practically about $400 million worth of fines were collected in the first half of 2023.
08:05.620 - 08:11.740:  So he's really just up to the surveillance, up to the policing, if you like, of the Amazon in Brazil.
08:12.080 - 08:16.200:  And you've just interviewed him. Haven't you, president Lillard, what did he tell you?
08:16.720 - 08:22.260:  These figures come in the context of a summit that's being hosted in Belling which is in the Amazon.
08:22.640 - 08:27.060:  That's where Brazil's going to host the cop climate summit in two years time. He's bringing
08:27.060 - 08:31.860:  eight countries that share the Amazon rainforest together in the city to discuss how to preserve
08:31.860 - 08:36.880:  the rainforest. And he seemed hopeful that the region can play a big part in trying to solve
08:42.880 - 08:46.660:  climate issues. This meeting is the first great opportunity for people to show the world what we
08:46.660 - 08:52.640:  want to do. If we have the political will and common sense, we will do it. Brazil will fulfill
08:52.640 - 08:58.880:  what was promised. We will reach zero deforestation in the Amazon in 2030. And Katie, is there any
08:58.880 - 09:05.440:  active opposition to this? I mean, will he be able to achieve his goal of stopping deforestation
09:05.480 - 09:10.720:  altogether by the end of the decade? Well, this is Brazil. And in politics, there's certainly
09:10.720 - 09:15.860:  an awful lot of people who don't like Lillard. Clearly, people who had been allowed to
09:16.380 - 09:20.280:  with fewer regulations in the last four years and were allowed to do more than they are now
09:20.280 - 09:26.040:  might not be so happy about it. Whether or not he is able to achieve his goal of stopping
09:26.040 - 09:31.320:  deforestation, I think it will be incredibly difficult to get it down to zero. But he's certainly
09:31.320 - 09:36.060:  committed with other countries to try and bring that number down. When I spoke to him, he said that
09:36.200 - 09:41.100:  people need to look at this region and stop just talking and actually doing. So the commitments there,
09:41.400 - 09:44.620:  whether or not it's over ambitious, I think everybody's going to be watching that.
09:45.240 - 09:51.520:  Katie Watson in Brazil. France has condemned the suspension of the state-run radio and television
09:51.520 - 09:57.660:  broadcasters in Niger following last week's coup describing the move as a authoritarian repression.
09:58.280 - 10:03.200:  Niger has been an important ally for France, which, like America, has a military presence there
10:03.200 - 10:09.540:  to fight jihadists in the region. But relations have sired since the coup nine days ago when hundreds
10:09.540 - 10:14.720:  of French nationals were evacuated from the country after protesters attacked the French embassy.
10:15.460 - 10:20.160:  On Thursday, protests were held in Niger's capital Niamé in support of the military coup.
10:20.680 - 10:24.320:  Arafika correspondent Catherine Biera-Hanga has compiled this report.
10:28.480 - 10:35.320:  Long live the Nigerian army, a nation for the patriots, crowds chanted in Niger's capital,
10:35.940 - 10:41.660:  thousands gathered in front of parliament to show support for the country's new military leaders
10:41.660 - 10:49.240:  who are facing a chorus of international calls to step down. It's also Independence Day in Niger
10:49.820 - 10:55.140:  and the rallies focused on hostility to France. The country's former colonial power,
10:55.140 - 11:01.960:  which still has troops in the country. Some Nigerians, like this protestor, are also angry with
11:01.960 - 11:07.020:  the West African regional grouping known as ECOWAS, which has condemned the coup.
11:09.920 - 11:14.140:  We are going to demonstrate to all the ECOWAS countries in all those who are taking
11:14.140 - 11:19.640:  and popular and inhumane measures against Niger, which is in the process of freeing itself
11:19.640 - 11:26.620:  from the York of colonization. Some in the crowd waived Russian flags,
11:26.620 - 11:32.660:  like neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali, which have also experienced recent coups,
11:33.080 - 11:38.720:  some believe during closer to Moscow offers better economic and security prospects.
11:39.560 - 11:45.500:  But there is also a sizable part of Nichea's population that once a return to civilian rule
11:45.900 - 11:51.320:  and who have carried out their own protests in the past few days. Regional efforts at
11:51.320 - 11:57.540:  a mediation have so far failed to convince the soldiers of Nichea to go back to their barracks.
11:58.200 - 12:03.840:  Catherine Bjarahanga. At least 12 people have been injured in South Korea after a man drove a
12:03.840 - 12:08.880:  car into pedestrians and then attacked many of them with a knife. The incident happened south of
12:08.880 - 12:15.840:  the capital's soul. Jean McKenzie has more details. The suspect dressed all in black drove his car
12:15.840 - 12:21.240:  onto the pavement during the evening rush hour, ramming into four people. He then got out,
12:21.240 - 12:27.060:  brandishing a knife and walked into a busy shopping centre where he stabbed at least nine others.
12:27.760 - 12:32.360:  All of the injured have been taken to hospital. Some are said to be seriously hurt.
12:33.080 - 12:39.160:  At the scene police have arrested a man in his 20s. South Korea's National Police Commissioner
12:39.160 - 12:45.760:  has described this as an indiscriminate attack. It follows another random stabbing in soul
12:45.760 - 12:52.900:  a fortnight ago in which one person was killed. Jean McKenzie, now to a possible breakthrough in
12:52.900 - 12:59.080:  preventing the transmission of malaria from mosquitoes to humans. Scientists at a Glaxo's
12:59.080 - 13:04.700:  Smith Klein research facility in Spain have discovered a naturally occurring strain of bacteria which
13:04.700 - 13:11.480:  over time inhibits the development of malaria parasites in a mosquito's gut. More research is
13:11.480 - 13:16.540:  taking place following the discovery but is being seen as a potentially significant tool that could
13:16.540 - 13:22.320:  be used to combat the spread of the disease, which in 2021 accounted for the deaths of more than
13:22.320 - 13:28.960:  600,000 people around the world. Julian Warockers worked the author of the research from Glaxo's
13:28.960 - 13:36.560:  Smith Klein, Janet Rodriguez. We froze down those tissue samples in our freezer and took this
13:36.560 - 13:42.600:  bacteria which we had isolated. We put it into a new colony which was established in our
13:42.600 - 13:51.500:  insectory and we infected these mosquitoes with the malaria parasite and yes we found that it was
13:51.500 - 13:56.560:  the one responsible for reducing infection in these mosquitoes. So this is effectively a
13:56.560 - 14:03.720:  natural bacteria which you've now discovered inhibits the development of the malaria parasites
14:03.720 - 14:10.220:  in a mosquito's gut. Exactly. That's what you've now found. Yes. And how significant is that
14:10.220 - 14:16.420:  potentially? Or potentially it is tremendously significant because all of the currently
14:16.420 - 14:23.000:  are used vector control tools or those which are in development. These target the mosquito itself.
14:23.000 - 14:30.560:  So they kill the mosquito vector and because of that there is a high chance for development of
14:30.560 - 14:37.320:  resistance and resistance to insecticides is now one of the major challenges for a mosquito
14:37.320 - 14:43.880:  vector control. So that's the reason why this has this kind of intervention has an added advantage.
14:43.880 - 14:49.400:  And also it would mean that those particular mosquitoes would no longer threaten humans
14:49.400 - 14:56.720:  with malaria. Exactly. What's then the potential application of this on the kind of scale that
14:56.720 - 15:02.680:  would make a difference around the world? So looking into the future I mean we would like to see
15:02.680 - 15:09.980:  this used of course a deployed as a tool or deployed as a tool for the prevention of malaria.
15:10.640 - 15:16.380:  But what we see from this study what what we concluded from this study is that we not only have
15:17.000 - 15:22.360:  the TC1 bacteria which could be used as an active ingredient to be incorporated into
15:22.860 - 15:28.680:  potential vector control tools. We have three different active potential active ingredients which
15:28.680 - 15:34.600:  have arisen from this TC1 based intervention. Right. So in those circumstances the mosquitoes would
15:34.600 - 15:41.960:  would absorb that bacteria based intervention. Exactly. And that would have the effect of
15:41.960 - 15:47.280:  nullifying the mosquitoes gut and being able to pass on malaria. There was a particular figure
15:48.180 - 15:54.560:  added to this that this strain can reduce a mosquito's parasite load by up to 73% is that right?
15:54.720 - 16:01.540:  Yes. And in terms of that wider application what happens now in terms of trying to make this
16:01.540 - 16:06.640:  make the difference everybody wants it to make for those who might be at risk of malaria.
16:07.140 - 16:13.240:  So the advantage we have is that one it is non-genetically engineered microorganism. It is naturally
16:13.240 - 16:18.640:  present in the environment. So based on these preliminary experiments we are doing additional
16:18.640 - 16:26.420:  rounds of experiments to ensure that we do have good efficacy, good uptake of this bacteria
16:26.420 - 16:32.880:  in the mosquito gut and also to ensure safety within the environs of that mosquito sphere.
16:33.080 - 16:38.180:  What's the timescale for all this in terms of when it becomes a practical application?
16:38.520 - 16:44.040:  It's too early to say because these are just the preliminary studies so it would be too
16:44.060 - 16:51.960:  speculative to talk about timelines right now. But put it into context for us when we think of all
16:51.960 - 16:56.940:  the other developments there have been in recent times. Where does this one sit?
16:57.420 - 17:04.820:  I wish I could answer that because right now what we have is we don't have a final product format.
17:05.440 - 17:09.440:  But it's a good day. It is a good day. It's a very good day.
17:10.240 - 17:13.500:  Janet Rodriguez from Glaxo Smith Klein.
17:16.220 - 17:20.400:  Still to come why fish skin is being used to treat wounds.
17:20.720 - 17:26.080:  With fish there is no virus that can be transferred from a fish to a man. There's no mad
17:26.080 - 17:29.640:  cod disease and that's what does the good in the healing.
17:37.040 - 17:43.180:  Hi I'm Hannah. I am the host of a new daily podcast What in the World from the BBC World Service

18:08.480 - 18:14.540:  says it was one of their teams which struck the Kirch bridge linking Russia with Crimea last month.
18:15.060 - 18:20.880:  The attack temporarily stopped traffic on a strategically important route. Russia blamed marine
18:20.880 - 18:27.200:  base drones. Here's Pommos. There was a time when Ukraine didn't comment on operations behind
18:27.200 - 18:32.660:  enemy lines but the authorities in Kiev have recently become more candid and have now claimed
18:32.660 - 18:38.460:  responsibility for blowing up part of the Kirch bridge last month. By linking Russia with occupied
18:38.460 - 18:44.700:  Crimea the bridge has come to symbolize Russia's territorial conquests but the secretary of Ukraine's
18:44.700 - 18:49.700:  national defence and security council mocked the idea that the bridge was heavily protected.
18:49.700 - 18:56.480:  Alexey Danelov said many Russian facilities were labeled untouchable but the Ukraine was putting
18:56.480 - 19:03.380:  that claim where it belonged. Pommos. Well conflicts like the one in Ukraine have been taking place
19:03.380 - 19:08.440:  throughout history. Ways to treat those wounded in war are constantly being developed
19:08.860 - 19:14.300:  via new medical techniques but sometimes the most simple ideas have extraordinary outcomes.
19:14.820 - 19:19.780:  A British surgeon Stephen Jeffrey, a professor specialising in the study of wounds,
19:19.780 - 19:25.720:  has worked in several war zones. He told Martha Carney that specially treated fish skin
19:25.720 - 19:31.020:  proves invaluable when treating soldiers injured on the modern battlefield.
19:31.920 - 19:37.260:  It facilitates and promotes and speeds up wound healing and when you're in a mass casualty
19:37.260 - 19:42.420:  situation where you have more casualties than you can operate on one of the things I bring with me
19:42.420 - 19:49.340:  this fish skin because it will by speeding up the process of wound healing it will allow more
19:49.340 - 19:54.120:  patients to be treated. And just so people can know what it looks like it's rather kind of
19:54.300 - 20:00.000:  papery, thin, white piece of almost it looks like parchment be. I can see the sort of traces of
20:00.000 - 20:04.500:  what it looks like scales or you know where scales have been on it and how exactly does it work?
20:05.440 - 20:09.980:  Well this is free stride so when you when you wet it it sort of rehydrates and then it becomes
20:09.980 - 20:14.140:  more pliable and when you normally take an animal product and you want to use it on a human you have
20:14.140 - 20:19.760:  to process it very thoroughly to get rid of any risk of viral transmission you know is it going to
20:19.800 - 20:25.660:  contain hepatitis HIV, mad cow disease anything like this. And doing that you get rid of a lot of
20:25.660 - 20:30.880:  the structure and a lot of the goodness of the chemicals that promote healing and it turns out
20:30.880 - 20:36.600:  that with fish there is no virus that can be transferred from a fish to a man there's no mad
20:36.600 - 20:42.920:  cow disease. So the processing is a lot more gentle it retains a lot more of that good structure
20:43.600 - 20:48.560:  for example the omega-3 fatty acids and that's what does the good in the healing.
20:48.640 - 20:54.420:  Is this part of a trend in a way that we're going back to what might seem to be more traditional
20:54.420 - 20:59.420:  old fashioned remedies? Well certainly we are rediscovering that what our ancestors used not all
20:59.420 - 21:03.840:  was mumbo jumbo some of it actually works. The other good thing about the fishkin is it's a
21:03.900 - 21:09.200:  form of recycling because this is skin that's come from the food industry you know this is we eat
21:09.200 - 21:15.940:  the cod and previously they would throw away the skin but now that can be processed and turned into
21:16.200 - 21:20.880:  a very useful product for wound healing. The British surgeon Stephen Jeffrey.
21:22.000 - 21:26.140:  Now to Romania where the government has been implementing policies to try to persuade its
21:26.140 - 21:32.580:  diaspora to move back home almost 20% of the population live elsewhere and that causes issues
21:33.240 - 21:38.260:  particularly in the health and construction sectors in the country. Tessa Dunlop has been meeting
21:38.260 - 21:50.620:  those who've decided to return home to Romania. That is actually a plastic hammer banging soft
21:50.620 - 21:58.640:  Italian leather in a Transylvanian workshop. What are you making that? It's a skirt with suspenders.
21:58.640 - 22:04.960:  We're basically hammering the seams to make them nice and flat so we can make the final stitch.
22:05.720 - 22:11.280:  I'm inclusion apocca a city in the west of Romania and one of its richest with fashion designer
22:11.280 - 22:18.420:  Alina Morar. She returned here in 2019 having spent five years in London. I asked her why she'd
22:18.420 - 22:24.860:  originally left her homeland. Now it's a bit better but back then 10 years ago I had blue hair like
22:24.860 - 22:31.880:  everyone was making fun and pointing fingers at me. Self expression wasn't big. What brings you
22:31.880 - 22:37.460:  back? What pulls you back to Romania? On Facebook and some members of my family told me that there
22:37.460 - 22:43.220:  are this funding that's been offered to people that have been living outside of Romania for at least one
22:43.220 - 22:48.980:  year. It's funding for startups for people that have an idea about something they want to do. It
22:48.980 - 22:54.000:  doesn't have to be. I didn't even have to have a company. I just needed to have an idea and a
22:54.000 - 22:58.920:  business plan put together with something that I wanted to do. With the help of EU funds in 2014
22:58.920 - 23:07.080:  the government introduced diaspora grants. Alina got 33,000 euros. That's roughly 37,000 US dollars
23:07.740 - 23:12.680:  and it's not the only policy being used to tempt the diaspora home. The mayor of inclusion apocca
23:12.680 - 23:18.720:  Emil Bach was Prime Minister of Romania just after the country joined the European Union in 2007.
23:18.780 - 23:22.520:  Hundreds of thousands of people were leaving every year.
23:23.060 - 23:28.160:  Unfortunately the interest of Romania in the European Union was followed by the economic crisis.
23:28.740 - 23:34.300:  So it was accelerating the migration process. We were in the situation not to have money to
23:34.300 - 23:38.500:  pay pension and salaries. And what impact did that have hair on the ground in Romania?
23:39.280 - 23:44.240:  We had to cancel projects. We had no people in construction. We had money but no people to work
23:44.240 - 23:49.960:  and to finalize the bridge or a street or something like that. We had to close sometimes hospitals.
23:49.960 - 23:56.060:  We had in the worst case scenario possible a combination of losing people and economic crisis.
23:56.540 - 24:01.500:  The scale of the exodus was terrifying but these days Romania is a changed place.
24:02.340 - 24:08.700:  Aided by an EU boost of 30 billion euros it's projected to be the third fastest growing economy
24:08.700 - 24:13.020:  in the European Union this year. Of all the policies the Romanian government
24:13.020 - 24:17.580:  introduced to get the diaspora back their most successful has been in the health sector.
24:18.200 - 24:26.080:  In 2018 the increased salaries by around 70% overnight and by 2021 the number of doctors
24:26.080 - 24:31.200:  applying to work abroad had almost halved. Joanna Beres is a fetal cardiologist
24:31.580 - 24:36.520:  and spent almost a decade working for Britain's National Health Service. She's just moved home to
24:36.520 - 24:42.540:  Timishwara which is this year's European capital of culture. We have decided to come back
24:42.540 - 24:48.740:  right in time in Timishwara because there is a lot of festivals happening in Timishwara which
24:48.960 - 24:56.260:  I don't recall this happening 10, 15 years ago and I think you feel much more up to date
24:56.260 - 25:00.580:  which what's happening in the world. For some though the policies aren't cutting through
25:01.300 - 25:06.000:  and life on a lower salary often seems better in Western Europe. The government's introduced
25:06.000 - 25:11.180:  tax breaks for the construction industry but builder Jan is still struggling to find the staff.
25:11.660 - 25:14.600:  Mábu Santérs no James Fáx, Santérs CEO of Alta Férs.
25:14.600 - 25:23.120:  Saying as an example I had the construction site and I had no people, absolutely no people to work with.
25:23.420 - 25:28.600:  I buried my workers a thousand years a month. That's the same amount of money that the worker
25:28.600 - 25:31.740:  in Italy would earn but they still don't want to come back.
25:32.680 - 25:38.620:  That report by Tessa Dunlop. Here in Britain five people have been arrested after they
25:38.620 - 25:43.600:  climbed onto the roof of the British Prime Minister's home in Northern England to protest against
25:43.600 - 25:49.880:  his fossil fuel policies. The demonstrators from the climate group Greenpeace draped black fabric
25:49.880 - 25:55.760:  over the house. The activists also laid out a banner on the front lawn reading Rishi Sunak
25:55.760 - 26:02.500:  oil profits or our future. This week he'd approved hundreds of new oil and gas exploration licenses
26:02.700 - 26:08.220:  in the North Sea, angering environmentalists. From North Yorkshire Pionotrock reports.
26:09.300 - 26:14.580:  On a quiet lane in North Yorkshire police cars still surround the Prime Minister's family home.
26:15.160 - 26:21.280:  Inside the grounds in front of a union flag you can see ladders propped up next to a CCTV camera.
26:21.860 - 26:24.840:  The investigation into how this happened is well underway.
26:24.840 - 26:28.820:  Protesters wearing harnesses and hard hats climbed onto the roof.
26:29.280 - 26:33.640:  Footage released by the campaign group Greenpeace appeared to show them walking under the
26:33.640 - 26:40.100:  property unchallenged. The Conservative MP Greg Clark said the breach of security was a real concern.
26:40.460 - 26:46.500:  The home of the Prime Minister should be secure. I think everyone would accept this. We
26:47.200 - 26:50.360:  do know the risks and the dangers. I'm not saying that these protesters
26:51.660 - 26:55.940:  had in mind violence in tennis but that doesn't matter.
26:56.300 - 27:02.060:  Another senior Tory backbencher Alicia Kerns said politicians family homes should not be under
27:02.060 - 27:07.640:  assault. The former Deputy Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police Peter Walker says the
27:07.640 - 27:14.940:  situation could have been much worse. There is an opportunity here for somebody who wants to
27:14.940 - 27:22.560:  attack the Prime Minister to place an improvised explosive device at the premises and I really hope
27:22.560 - 27:27.580:  they're going to be checked after all this is over. It seems to me that the wrought to have been
27:27.900 - 27:33.800:  police presence at the home. The fact that it has been left unattended is astonishing.
27:34.300 - 27:40.100:  Three men and two women remain in custody as detectives continue to investigate why the Prime
27:40.100 - 27:47.360:  Minister's home was not safe and secure. Fiona Trott in Northern England. The American pop-style
27:47.360 - 27:53.600:  Lizzo has denied allegations that she sexually harassed and fat-shamed three of her former dancers.
27:53.600 - 27:58.140:  They've filed a lawsuit against the singer who called the accusations unbelievable.
27:58.760 - 28:01.340:  Our entertainment correspondent Common Patterson reports.
28:05.500 - 28:10.920:  Lizzo has won Grammys and many devoted fans who love her messages of inclusivity and body
28:10.920 - 28:16.580:  positivity. 36 hours after being faced with a lawsuit containing allegations of body shaming
28:16.580 - 28:21.880:  sexual harassment and having created a hostile work environment, Lizzo responded with a lengthy
28:21.880 - 28:27.640:  statement on social media. She described the allegations as false, unbelievable, and two outrageous
28:27.640 - 28:33.240:  to not be addressed, saying that it had never been her intention to make anyone feel uncomfortable
28:33.240 - 28:37.220:  and that she would never criticise or fire an employee because of their weight.
28:37.980 - 28:41.900:  The three dancers who were bringing the case against Lizzo gave me the reaction to Lizzo's
28:41.900 - 28:46.040:  statements. Crystal Williams and Ariana Davis were both sacked by the singer.
28:46.580 - 28:51.540:  Noel Rodriguez resigned in protest. Speaking from the lawyer's office in Los Angeles,
28:52.000 - 28:57.580:  Ariana Davis responded to Lizzo's comment that she was not the villain she'd been made out to be.
28:57.900 - 29:03.840:  She's less of a villain and more of an anti-hero to me and what that means to me is that a villain is
29:03.840 - 29:09.480:  someone with no redeemable qualities. They are bad and evil and terrible, but an anti-hero is
29:09.480 - 29:14.700:  someone who does bad things but has redeemable qualities. Do I think Lizzo can take this
29:14.700 - 29:23.080:  and change and be who she says she is? Yes, absolutely. I want her to be who she said she was
29:23.580 - 29:28.720:  when I first met her. Crystal Williams said it had never been their intention for the three to go
29:28.720 - 29:36.480:  public. This was worst case scenario. It was a last resort. There were several attempts made to
29:36.480 - 29:44.440:  try to handle this privately. I multiple times asked to speak with her. The BBC has asked Lizzo
29:44.440 - 29:50.700:  for an interview, but there has been no response. Colin Patterson. And finally, the composer Carl
29:50.700 - 29:56.860:  Davis who wrote the music for more than 100 films in television series has died at the age of 86.
29:56.860 - 30:02.860:  He was born in New York, but had lived in the UK since the early 1960s. A versatile and
30:02.860 - 30:08.380:  prolific musician he composed scores in a wide range of styles for films, including the French
30:08.380 - 30:14.160:  Lieutenant's Woman and television series, such as Pride and Prejudice. Sophie Van Ruegan looks
30:14.160 - 30:22.420:  back at his life. Carl Davis's music for the BBC's Pride and Prejudice. Like so many of his works,
30:22.420 - 30:29.600:  it was tuneful and just right for the purpose. He arrived in Britain in 1961. From then on, themes
30:29.600 - 30:34.900:  and incidental music poured from his pen, for everything from the world at war, to Ben Hur,
30:34.900 - 30:41.140:  to Torvalandine's Fire and Ice. From the 1970s, he became the world's foremost composer of music
30:41.140 - 30:47.460:  for silent films. He wrote and adapted a mammoth five hours of music for a restored version
30:47.500 - 30:50.780:  of Abel Garces 1927 masterpiece Napoleon.
30:58.040 - 31:05.520:  Ah, Sophie Van Ruegan there on the life of the composer Carl Davis, who's died at the age of 86.
