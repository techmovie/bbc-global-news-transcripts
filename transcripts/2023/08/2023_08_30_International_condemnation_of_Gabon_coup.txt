01:14.380 - 01:19.580:  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Thursday, the 31st of August, these are our main stories.
01:20.160 - 01:24.500:  The international community condemns the latest African coup this time in Gabon,
01:24.500 - 01:30.000:  but there's elation on the streets of the capital. Hurricane devastation in the US state of Florida.
01:30.480 - 01:37.280:  Doors tossed off hinges, a microwave, a flat screen TV. They've just been blown out of these
01:37.280 - 01:41.980:  houses as these hurricane winds came in and made landfall of the early hours of this morning.
01:42.440 - 01:45.460:  And how Netflix wants to be a big beast in gaming.
01:48.260 - 01:52.340:  Also in this podcast with Spank Accounts planned to become more transparent,
01:52.340 - 01:56.480:  and one of Asia's richest men reveals his succession plans.
02:00.280 - 02:04.560:  The African Union, the United Nations and France have joined the widespread international
02:04.560 - 02:10.560:  condemnation of Wednesday's coup in Gabon. The United States has it's closely watching the situation
02:10.560 - 02:15.240:  and it's deeply concerning. Army officers have dissolved official institutions
02:15.240 - 02:20.100:  in close the country's borders, saying the head of the presidential guard, General Brisa
02:20.100 - 02:24.920:  Liga Guaymer, will now be the head of state. Our Africa Regional Editor, Will Ross, looks
02:24.940 - 02:27.120:  back on a day of dramatic events in Gabon.
02:32.400 - 02:36.480:  On state TV, a group of military officers announced that they're now in charge of oil rich
02:36.480 - 02:40.580:  carbon. They said for the sake of peace they were putting an end to what they called the regime
02:40.580 - 02:46.180:  and cancelled the result of last weekend's election, which unsurprisingly was won by the incumbent
02:46.180 - 02:53.980:  President Ali Bongo. On the streets of the capital, Libraville crowds of people waving green,
02:53.980 - 02:58.160:  yellow and blue national flags cheered the military men who just seized power.
02:58.940 - 03:02.680:  Now under arrest in his presidential palace, Ali Bongo appealed for help.
03:03.000 - 03:09.860:  I'm to send a message to all the friends that we have all over the world to tell them to make noise,
03:09.860 - 03:15.380:  to make noise. In the short video clip, the deposed President urged people across the world to
03:15.380 - 03:21.340:  raise awareness of his plight. Make noise he pleaded. Ali Bongo took over as President when his
03:21.340 - 03:28.740:  father died in 2009. Omar Bongo had himself been in charge since 1967. Perhaps it's not surprising
03:28.740 - 03:33.220:  that people in Gabon are celebrating what looks like the end of a hugely corrupt dynasty.
03:33.220 - 03:39.120:  But with eight coups in West and Central Africa since 2020, many people on the continent are
03:39.120 - 03:44.480:  wondering where is next. As Will Ross in Nairobi, now my colleague, Gillian Marshall has been talking
03:44.480 - 03:49.580:  to Laurie Sember who works for a local media company in Gabon and lives in the capital Libraville.
03:53.060 - 03:56.940:  Since the coup this morning, people have been very happy in the streets of Libraville.
03:57.940 - 04:00.880:  People have welcomed the news and it's not surprising at all really.
04:01.940 - 04:06.700:  No one approved the old system. In fact, people are rejecting the old system.
04:07.540 - 04:12.040:  And they do so in the election by rejecting the ruling party. Everyone took to the streets
04:12.040 - 04:17.460:  to chair the soldiers in their honor. I was in the streets myself and I could see that people
04:17.460 - 04:26.400:  were very happy. So you personally are feeling happy that Ali Bongo has been
04:26.400 - 04:34.440:  ousted in a military coup? I would say I have mixed feelings because on the one hand,
04:34.480 - 04:40.640:  I didn't vote for him. So I'm glad he's no longer here. On the other hand, I don't know how
04:40.640 - 04:46.100:  the junta intends to govern this country. If they're going to put power in the hands of a man
04:46.100 - 04:50.940:  who's been elected or if they're going to ensure a transition similar to what we've seen
04:50.940 - 05:02.160:  in Bikina Faso and Niger nowadays. So what has life been like for the people of Gabon over more
05:02.160 - 05:13.600:  than half a century of rule by the Bongo family? So I would say that it's as if we're divided
05:13.600 - 05:20.100:  into castes. There's one cast that's very rich and getting richer. And there's another cast
05:20.100 - 05:26.620:  that's poor and getting poorer. And that's life under the reign of the Bongo's. In other words,
05:26.620 - 05:32.500:  there are people who are ill-treated, who have absolutely nothing. And then there are people
05:32.500 - 05:38.700:  who are very well off because they were born benefiting from the system. I think it's a bit like that
05:38.700 - 05:48.080:  in all countries, maybe not without gene apologies. Now among those watching events in Gabon and
05:48.080 - 05:54.240:  the wider region is Francois Alond, who was France's socialist president from 2012 to 2017.
05:54.300 - 06:02.560:  He's been talking to James King-Russami. It's different from Niger in the sense that the Bongo
06:02.560 - 06:07.000:  family, which had governed a bond for more than 50 years, had certainly caused its aspiration
06:07.060 - 06:11.400:  amongst the population. But it's the same process as the one we've been experiencing for three years
06:11.400 - 06:16.900:  now, which happened first in Mali, then in Bicino Faso, then in Guinea, then in Chad, in Niger,
06:16.900 - 06:21.820:  and now in Japan. In other words, the military are seizing power and overthrowing democratically
06:21.820 - 06:26.340:  elected and therefore fully legitimate presidents, although some are no doubt more questionable.
06:27.280 - 06:31.720:  But it is this process of militarization of power in Africa that we must react to today.
06:32.920 - 06:42.440:  Given then in Gabon, you say that the population had perhaps got tired of having one family ruling
06:42.440 - 06:50.040:  them for more than 50 years, is France in any way responsible for propping up the Bongo family?
06:54.380 - 06:57.460:  There was a period several decades ago and French presidents or governments
06:57.460 - 07:01.740:  accommodated the Bongo family, and there were interests, certainly economic interests,
07:01.740 - 07:06.820:  that justified this relationship. But for about 15 years, or at least since my presidency,
07:06.820 - 07:11.600:  I have never had any dealings with the Bongo family beyond the traditional relations, official
07:11.600 - 07:16.060:  relations. Gabon was one of the countries where there had been, not without difficulty,
07:16.060 - 07:21.460:  an electoral process that had been made official. So, was it because this process was not respected
07:21.460 - 07:26.140:  that the two detested at place? It's possible. That's one theory. Or was it because the same
07:26.140 - 07:31.140:  family had been in power for too long? That too, certainly. And in the countries which have had
07:31.140 - 07:36.200:  these coup d'état, they have not been reversed. Is there a way of reversing these coup d'état?
07:39.360 - 07:42.520:  It's difficult to imagine overthrowing a military regime without military means,
07:42.520 - 07:47.240:  but it's not up to France to carry out this type of operation. No, it's up to the Africans
07:47.240 - 07:51.680:  themselves, no, what they accept or what they don't accept. And so I think that the military
07:51.680 - 07:56.860:  solution is not the right one, if it's coming from France or Western countries. It can only be,
07:56.860 - 08:02.520:  if the Africans themselves decide they want it. I think that Russia and China have
08:02.520 - 08:07.120:  a vested interest in seeing that the West, France in particular, is driven out of countries where
08:07.120 - 08:11.780:  until now there have been trust in respectful relations. The reactions of Russia and China
08:11.780 - 08:16.140:  suggest that they are also questioning their situation, because they have interests at state.
08:16.940 - 08:21.120:  So I don't think Russia and China are necessarily as influential everywhere as they might imagine.
08:21.640 - 08:25.380:  But it's true that there is a form of neo-colonialism coming from Russia and China.
08:25.940 - 08:29.860:  From Russia through military means, and from China through autonomic and financial means.
08:30.400 - 08:33.620:  The form of French President François Alainte with James King Rosami.
08:34.300 - 08:38.040:  Hurricane Idalia has crossed Florida, leaving devastation in its wake.
08:38.040 - 08:43.360:  It's weakened after making landfall in the Big Ben region, but high winds, heavy rain and
08:43.360 - 08:47.600:  dangerous flooding, causing significant material damage to people
08:47.600 - 08:50.800:  known to have been killed in car crashes related to the storm.
08:50.800 - 08:55.320:  The site where it made landfall is sparsely populated, but the effects of the hurricane
08:55.320 - 09:00.020:  have been felt over a much wider area with most of coastal Tampa Bay now flooded.
09:00.500 - 09:03.340:  The mayor of the inland city of Tallahassee is Johnny Daley.
09:03.760 - 09:08.840:  I cannot stress enough the impact of this storm, the largest storm in history.
09:08.840 - 09:13.400:  I do believe to hit the Big Ben region definitely to hit the city of Tallahassee.
09:13.400 - 09:18.120:  So we're taking it extremely serious. We're feeling it here in Tallahassee,
09:18.120 - 09:20.560:  and it is going to impact us, and we're going to have damage.
09:20.980 - 09:22.420:  The state governor is Ron DeSantis.
09:22.960 - 09:28.040:  There have been 262,000 counts that had lost power have been restored,
09:28.040 - 09:34.740:  and there are more than 250,000 accounts that are currently out of power and in need of restoration.
09:35.000 - 09:39.180:  Tampa Airport is going to reopen for incoming flights at 4 p.m.
09:39.180 - 09:42.200:  By 3 a.m. tomorrow will be fully reopened.
09:42.340 - 09:46.520:  Gainesville Airport will reopen tonight, and Tallahassee Airport will reopen
09:46.980 - 09:47.920:  first thing in the morning.
09:48.480 - 09:52.620:  One of the worst hit areas is Cedar Kea city of the North West Coast of Florida,
09:52.980 - 09:54.780:  a correspondent Helen Humphrey is there.
09:55.180 - 09:58.340:  It is utterly devastating remnants of people's lives,
09:58.340 - 10:03.440:  doors tossed off hinges, a microwave, a flat screen TV.
10:03.440 - 10:06.020:  They've just been blown out of these houses.
10:06.020 - 10:10.340:  These hurricane winds came in and made landfall in the early hours of this morning.
10:10.460 - 10:14.620:  We have heard that everybody in this community is thankfully accounted for,
10:14.620 - 10:18.740:  but now authorities have got to come in and survey the scale of the damage,
10:18.740 - 10:21.560:  and we also understand that in this area there was a bed and breakfast,
10:21.560 - 10:26.200:  a hotel half of it was just washed into the Gulf.
10:26.240 - 10:28.840:  And this is the issue here as well, because it wasn't just those winds.
10:28.840 - 10:33.080:  It is that storm surge which was coming in off the Gulf there,
10:33.220 - 10:36.640:  and it times here was coming in at seven feet.
10:36.780 - 10:40.100:  And then essentially what it's done is it's wash all of this water in,
10:40.380 - 10:44.280:  all that sand, that mud, that sea water, and as a result,
10:44.280 - 10:49.060:  no power here, no sewage system here right now, no clean water.
10:49.520 - 10:51.720:  Helen Humphrey in Cedar Kea in Florida.
10:52.460 - 10:54.700:  The Armenians call it the road of life.
10:54.700 - 10:59.940:  The Larchin corridor has been the only road connecting 120,000 ethnic Armenians
11:00.240 - 11:04.700:  living in the Azerbaijanian clave and Nagorno-Karabakh with the Republic of Armenia.
11:05.320 - 11:09.080:  The road's been blocked by the Azerbaijanian authorities for nearly nine months,
11:09.080 - 11:12.880:  though, resulting in severe shortages of food and medication.
11:13.420 - 11:18.240:  Armenia says there is a humanitarian crisis, a claim denied by Azerbaijan,
11:18.240 - 11:21.400:  which says it's just restored its territorial integrity.
11:21.940 - 11:24.460:  Renda Mitri sent this report from the border area.
11:26.260 - 11:29.000:  Haik has been stuck in goris for months,
11:29.320 - 11:33.540:  unable to reach his family on the other side of the Larchin corridor.
11:34.260 - 11:39.500:  It's a vital road connecting Karabakh Armenians with the Republic of Armenia.
11:40.320 - 11:43.400:  But now there is an Azerbaijan military checkpoint.
11:44.040 - 11:47.580:  Haik prefers for safety reasons not to give his real name.
11:50.180 - 11:52.880:  Any information we give can be used against us.
11:53.240 - 11:55.040:  The current situation is catastrophic.
11:55.040 - 11:58.580:  They want to force people to accept a Azerbaijanis citizenship,
11:58.580 - 12:02.140:  to change the supply road so that we're dependent on Azerbaijan.
12:02.980 - 12:03.740:  It will be awful.
12:04.900 - 12:10.120:  Up to 90 percent of all supplies to Karabakh used to originate from Armenia.
12:10.120 - 12:14.880:  Now, 400 tons of humanitarian aid from the Armenian government
12:14.880 - 12:17.980:  is stuck at the entrance to the Larchin corridor,
12:18.500 - 12:21.680:  unable to cross the Azerbaijan line of control.
12:22.440 - 12:25.680:  The humanitarian crisis, its men organized, men planned.
12:25.680 - 12:29.720:  Edmund Marokyan is the representative of the Armenian government.
12:29.720 - 12:35.240:  We have now this humanitarian crisis which is a tool on the hands of Azerbaijan
12:35.260 - 12:40.040:  to starve people and to push them out from their homeland.
12:42.860 - 12:47.740:  Armenia and Azerbaijan have been fighting for control of Nagorno-Korabakh
12:48.060 - 12:50.200:  and the surrounding territories for decades.
12:50.740 - 12:55.480:  It has been a contentious area due to historical, ethnic and religious factors.
12:55.980 - 12:59.860:  In 2020, Azerbaijan launched a major military offensive.
13:00.420 - 13:06.540:  In just six weeks, its forces retook control of all territories surrounding the enclave
13:06.900 - 13:10.380:  which had been held by Armenia since 1994.
13:14.440 - 13:16.860:  After Russia broke the ceasefire agreement,
13:16.860 - 13:21.640:  Russian peacekeepers were sent to ensure the safety of ethnic Armenians
13:22.000 - 13:26.780:  and allow access via the Larchin corridor to the Republic of Armenia.
13:30.040 - 13:34.060:  But since December 2022, Azerbaijan has blocked the road.
13:34.060 - 13:36.500:  First, with government-backed protesters,
13:37.120 - 13:39.640:  then in April, it set up a military checkpoint.
13:39.640 - 13:44.600:  This is how Azerbaijan's president Ilham Aliyev justified the decision.
13:46.440 - 13:49.900:  The construction of the border crossing means the complete restoration
13:50.140 - 13:52.300:  of our territorial integrity.
13:54.440 - 13:59.760:  The Red Cross is the only humanitarian organization with access to Nagorno-Korabakh,
14:00.300 - 14:05.820:  but the ICRC has not been able to guarantee safe passage through the Azerbaijani checkpoint
14:05.820 - 14:09.720:  as the Khachatrian family found out on July 29.
14:09.720 - 14:15.680:  Various father, 68-year-old Vagiv Khachatrian, was arrested at the Azeri checkpoint
14:15.680 - 14:19.700:  accused of war crimes committed in the 1990s.
14:21.700 - 14:23.260:  He was diagnosed with heart conditions.
14:23.720 - 14:27.380:  In Karabakh, we approached the Red Cross to help organize his evacuation.
14:27.500 - 14:31.140:  At the checkpoint, they said they needed 10 minutes to question him.
14:31.440 - 14:33.920:  Then, they took him in an unknown direction.
14:34.380 - 14:37.640:  Now, every second, we are thinking what will happen to him.
14:38.020 - 14:40.460:  If his heart stops, our lives will stop too.
14:41.700 - 14:42.740:  Randomly true reporting.
14:43.460 - 14:47.360:  An EU-scientific study concludes that high levels of radio activity and
14:47.360 - 14:52.600:  bores in southern Germany are caused not only by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident,
14:52.600 - 14:56.980:  but also by atomic bombs detonated during the cold war much earlier.
14:57.540 - 15:02.220:  The meat of these wild pigs from the Varian forests is already banned as unsafe,
15:02.220 - 15:07.240:  but this research suggests the surrounding soil pollution will endure for generations,
15:07.260 - 15:09.020:  more from Charles Havaland.
15:09.660 - 15:14.700:  The lasting radioactivity of Bavarian bores has been mainly blamed on the Chernobyl disaster,
15:15.340 - 15:19.000:  but many wondered why the bristly-tusked animals remained contaminated
15:19.000 - 15:22.140:  after poison levels in other creatures gradually dropped.
15:22.860 - 15:27.160:  Testing meat from 48 bores, these scientists found that their radioactivity
15:27.460 - 15:31.620:  is abundantly caused by older, cold war nuclear bomb blasts,
15:31.860 - 15:34.440:  up to 99% in some samples.
15:35.020 - 15:38.160:  As the bores dig for truffle mushrooms, their favoured food,
15:38.160 - 15:43.020:  the problem is worsened, as radioactive cesium steadily seeps down through the soil.
15:43.620 - 15:46.740:  The poisoning of the bores threatens the Bavarian forests themselves,
15:46.740 - 15:51.260:  as they're not shot for their meat, their populations are growing unsustainably.
15:52.140 - 15:55.700:  Now, if you're one of millions of people hooked on the TV drama Succession,
15:55.700 - 15:59.400:  the show about a super rich family loosely based on Rupert Murdoch.
15:59.800 - 16:03.560:  You're in for a treat, though, perhaps without the same level as drama and intrigue.
16:03.860 - 16:07.660:  One of Asia's richest men, Mukesh Ambani, head of the Ambani family,
16:07.660 - 16:12.620:  has announced a succession plan for the control of India's most valuable conglomerate.
16:13.060 - 16:17.000:  Sushma Ramachandran, a journalist and commentator with the Tribune newspaper in Delhi,
16:17.320 - 16:19.260:  has been telling Victoria a 100 more.
16:19.720 - 16:22.540:  It's slightly different from Succession because this rhyme around,
16:22.540 - 16:27.120:  there's no jockey for power, at least and not apparently.
16:27.700 - 16:31.640:  Mukesh Ambani, as you rightly said, he's, I think, the second richest man in the country,
16:32.160 - 16:34.760:  but owns the largest and most valuable company.
16:34.760 - 16:40.060:  Has three children, they're in the late 20s, they have been allocated one major chunk
16:40.600 - 16:41.660:  of the company.
16:41.660 - 16:43.620:  Asia has been given the retail sector.
16:43.900 - 16:47.300:  Akash has been given communications, which is very valuable.
16:47.640 - 16:52.100:  And the youngest Anand has been given the new energy sector, that is green energy.
16:52.360 - 16:55.740:  So that's been a very carefully laid out plan, I think, of Mukesh.
16:56.280 - 17:01.320:  And I think one of the reasons is because there was a succession like drama in his own life.
17:01.320 - 17:08.060:  When his father, the Hirubai passed away, he didn't have this kind of a succession plan.
17:08.060 - 17:14.440:  And there was a tremendous fight between the two brothers, Mukesh and his younger brother Anand.
17:14.660 - 17:16.560:  And this finally had to go to the mother.
17:16.580 - 17:20.020:  The mother sat down and did arbitration between the two brothers
17:20.620 - 17:22.800:  and divided the kingdom as it were.
17:23.020 - 17:24.720:  And so tell us about the daughter.
17:24.720 - 17:28.560:  Is that changing the role of women in Indian business society?
17:29.180 - 17:32.580:  Well, in Indian business, you've had a lot of daughters coming up.
17:32.740 - 17:37.200:  In fact, quite surprisingly, people have been quite happy to give their daughters control.
17:37.200 - 17:40.660:  You have one of the largest IT company that is HCL.
17:41.180 - 17:45.580:  Has Shivdada, the chairman's daughter, Roshni Dada has taken over.
17:46.080 - 17:50.440:  The Goldridge family has given a big chunk of control to their children.
17:50.960 - 17:53.380:  The Bidlas have also handed control to their children.
17:53.660 - 17:54.940:  But they have been problems.
17:54.940 - 17:58.700:  For instance, in one southern family, there was a legal problem.
17:58.700 - 18:03.500:  The daughter filed a case against her brothers because they refused to give her a share.
18:04.040 - 18:06.480:  Sushma Ramachandran with Victorian O-100.
18:09.040 - 18:10.660:  Still to come in the Global News podcast?
18:13.680 - 18:18.580:  Plans in India to stop monkeys bothering world leaders at the G20 summit.
18:25.180 - 18:29.640:  Unexpected elements is the podcast exploring the science behind the headlines.
18:30.020 - 18:31.240:  That's an interesting concept.
18:31.420 - 18:32.580:  It's just bubbling with excitement.
18:32.740 - 18:35.720:  Each week, we take a news story you've probably heard of
18:35.980 - 18:41.540:  and use the science surrounding it as a springboard to dive into other stories that may not be on your radar.
18:41.700 - 18:43.620:  We're here in my B-Lab.
18:43.780 - 18:45.540:  In front of a box of bees.
18:45.740 - 18:47.540:  The little bad side effects are done.
18:47.540 - 18:52.920:  Unexpected elements from the BBC World Service find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
18:56.460 - 18:59.660:  Swiss banks hold a huge amount of the world's offshore wealth.
18:59.660 - 19:06.300:  For years, the financial sector has faced international course to be a bit more transparent about whose money it is.
19:06.860 - 19:10.600:  Now the government has drafted new rules to tighten money laundering regulations.
19:10.600 - 19:14.160:  James Wickham is the editor of the BBC's World Business Report.
19:14.160 - 19:19.860:  Let me give you a number, Andrew, which is $2.4 trillion USD.
19:20.080 - 19:24.920:  That's the number of foreign assets held by banks in Switzerland.
19:24.920 - 19:30.420:  It's had that reputation as an even for people to go and to avoid taxes.
19:30.420 - 19:36.940:  It's a place for them to square all their money away to avoid fiscal authorities wherever they are in the world.
19:36.940 - 19:41.160:  But Switzerland has been trying to change that image for a long time.
19:41.160 - 19:48.600:  But it has faced quite a lot of international pressure over the last few months to shed a bit more light on this shadowy world of corporate ownership.
19:48.600 - 19:57.040:  What's basically happening is that many companies, many entities like Trusts are kind of cloaking the identity of the real beneficiaries of this money.
19:57.040 - 20:02.260:  Essentially, they're saying this is the name above the door, but that's not the person who's really getting the money.
20:02.260 - 20:05.620:  The person who's getting the money is the person behind the person with the name on the door.
20:05.940 - 20:09.300:  So these new regulations make it all more transparent?
20:09.300 - 20:14.180:  If you like a lack of transparency, what's made it such an appealing banking destination until now?
20:14.400 - 20:18.700:  Yeah, absolutely. So these proposals are going to see legal loopholes close.
20:19.200 - 20:24.920:  There's going to be a register to require the ultimate beneficial owners of these trusts and companies to be declared.
20:24.920 - 20:29.860:  Now, Switzerland is the only European country at the moment that doesn't have one of these registers.
20:29.860 - 20:35.200:  It's also got to make it easier to monitor how lawyers for rich clients operate as well.
20:35.200 - 20:38.840:  The finance minister says the reputation is good, but there are gaps to fill.
20:38.840 - 20:43.940:  And anyone who sets up trusts or holding companies, they're going to be subject to these new rules.
20:44.160 - 20:49.960:  There's a long way until this definitely gets sorted under Switzerland's political system.
20:49.960 - 20:52.980:  There's a whole period of consultation with political parties now.
20:52.980 - 20:55.340:  You've got civil groups. They only have a chat.
20:55.340 - 20:59.540:  It'll be until at least next year before any of this kind of comes in.
20:59.540 - 21:04.660:  And there's a lot of people saying these final measures might be significantly watered down as well.
21:04.660 - 21:07.740:  But Andrew, I think the point to make here is Switzerland over the last few months.
21:07.740 - 21:11.500:  There's had quite a few major scandals in and around its banking sector.
21:11.500 - 21:17.860:  The Swiss want to get rid of that idea that it's a place that you can go and just leave your money with no questions asked.
21:18.380 - 21:19.480:  James, we're come reporting.
21:19.500 - 21:25.680:  The US Secretary of Commerce says business patience is running thin with China on a trip to Shanghai.
21:25.680 - 21:29.920:  Gina Ramondo, slightly the challenges faced by US credit card companies,
21:29.920 - 21:34.660:  Visa and Mastercard in China, compared with Alipay's expansion in the US.
21:34.660 - 21:37.120:  She said she hoped things would change.
21:37.120 - 21:43.440:  Meanwhile in Beijing, Britain's foreign minister, James Cleveley, says he's raised human rights concerns with the government,
21:43.440 - 21:49.480:  but suggested that Britain needed a pragmatic relationship with China to tackle issues like climate change.
21:49.480 - 21:54.000:  He's the first senior British politician to go to China in more than five years.
21:54.460 - 21:57.360:  Our correspondent there, Stephen McDonald, has been talking to him.
21:58.860 - 22:02.980:  From the opening meeting at the great hall of the people, the foreign secretaries Chinese hosts
22:02.980 - 22:06.620:  were publicly very upbeat about the importance of this trip.
22:07.240 - 22:11.440:  Vice President Han Jung was the first to sit across the table from James Cleveley.
22:14.660 - 22:19.960:  He told the foreign secretary his visit would help promote stable relations between China and the UK,
22:20.700 - 22:22.340:  as well as improve economic ties.
22:22.920 - 22:25.640:  Mr. Cleveley has been criticised at home for coming,
22:25.660 - 22:28.400:  but he said without such face-to-face interaction,
22:28.460 - 22:33.220:  there was a greater chance of misinterpretations, mistrust and errors.
22:34.220 - 22:37.000:  A head of his meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi,
22:37.000 - 22:42.020:  he promised to raise the issue of human rights abuses against ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang,
22:42.500 - 22:44.900:  and the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong.
22:45.860 - 22:51.200:  He also told the BBC, he'd urge Beijing to use its influence with Russia to stop the invasion
22:51.240 - 22:54.740:  of Ukraine, despite the support offered by China to the Kremlin.
22:55.000 - 22:57.480:  I don't think it's in China's interest in any way,
22:58.040 - 23:01.460:  but there'd be a perception that they are actively or even passively
23:02.100 - 23:04.260:  support in Putin's brutal actions.
23:04.380 - 23:05.180:  I made that point.
23:05.180 - 23:07.520:  Just doesn't care about that. I mean, look, they...
23:07.520 - 23:11.400:  I do think, in the conversation that I've had, I think Beijing
23:12.100 - 23:15.240:  do care about what the world thinks of them.
23:15.440 - 23:19.420:  Mr. Cleveley said that China was at the forefront of green energy technology,
23:19.420 - 23:24.800:  but he hoped it would be much more courageous in a move away from polluting industries.
23:25.560 - 23:29.600:  And he said Beijing needed to build trust when it came to cooperation.
23:30.380 - 23:31.760:  If it wanted to trade successfully,
23:32.520 - 23:34.700:  during a very tough economic climate.
23:35.680 - 23:39.260:  Netflix says it's attempt to succeed in the video gaming industry
23:39.260 - 23:42.300:  is a natural extension of its subscription platform.
23:42.300 - 23:46.860:  The streaming service has offered games on mobile versions of its app for two years.
23:47.280 - 23:50.120:  Now, though, it wants to become a front runner in the gaming market,
23:50.120 - 23:55.120:  despite seeing other big entertainment companies try and fail at the same challenge.
23:55.760 - 23:57.980:  Here's our gaming correspondent, Stefan Powell.
23:59.880 - 24:03.140:  Think of Netflix and its show as like stranger things.
24:03.320 - 24:04.280:  Don't try to be heroes.
24:04.500 - 24:06.400:  And the crown that might spring to mind.
24:06.560 - 24:08.740:  For years, I've called for a more modern molecule.
24:08.740 - 24:10.700:  Not necessarily video games,
24:10.700 - 24:14.160:  but no developments to your doors like RipStorn in Liverpool
24:14.160 - 24:16.760:  and making games for the streaming service.
24:17.200 - 24:20.280:  They're playable on mobile phones and tablets only for now.
24:20.820 - 24:25.160:  Here, it's a chess simulator based on the Netflix drama The Queen's Gambit.
24:26.240 - 24:27.460:  The idea is clear.
24:27.780 - 24:30.700:  To stay relevant, Netflix wants a legitimate stake
24:30.700 - 24:34.200:  in an industry that hundreds of millions of people around the globe
24:34.560 - 24:35.720:  access every day.
24:36.220 - 24:37.760:  Leon Loom is from the company.
24:37.940 - 24:40.820:  Games is a really huge part of entertainment.
24:40.820 - 24:45.180:  And so it really is a natural progression for us to
24:45.720 - 24:48.720:  start thinking about how to offer games to our members.
24:49.020 - 24:51.260:  But Netflix is in the first mainstream entertainment
24:51.260 - 24:53.400:  or technology company to have this idea.
24:53.740 - 24:55.180:  What is eternal?
24:55.800 - 24:58.260:  Amazon and Google are just two others that have tried.
24:58.940 - 25:02.040:  Earlier this year, Google's Steady Our Service was shut down
25:02.040 - 25:04.580:  and Amazon Games has laid off workers.
25:05.220 - 25:06.960:  Making the transition is difficult,
25:06.960 - 25:09.320:  according to the Games journalist, Shae Thompson.
25:09.320 - 25:12.740:  They fundamentally misunderstood what it is about games
25:12.980 - 25:14.260:  that people love in the first place.
25:14.660 - 25:16.320:  They had big budgets behind them,
25:16.420 - 25:19.460:  but ultimately lacked creativity and uniqueness.
25:20.960 - 25:23.440:  By focusing on games for mobile devices though,
25:23.440 - 25:25.300:  Netflix is trying something different.
25:25.300 - 25:28.880:  They're cheaper and quicker to make than their console or PC
25:28.880 - 25:31.780:  counterparts, so easier to grow a portfolio.
25:32.360 - 25:33.160:  But there is a risk.
25:33.420 - 25:36.160:  This lack of scale and ambition could see them fail
25:36.160 - 25:39.160:  to grab players attention in such a crowded marketplace.
25:41.640 - 25:44.780:  The 80th Venice Film Festival opened on Wednesday,
25:44.780 - 25:48.380:  but many stars are missing because of the historic strike in Hollywood.
25:48.380 - 25:51.360:  They're concerned about the impact of subscriptions and streaming
25:51.860 - 25:54.020:  on the repeat payments that most depend on,
25:54.360 - 25:56.360:  as well as the growth of AI technology.
25:56.940 - 25:58.480:  There are two unions involved.
25:58.480 - 26:02.120:  Duncan Crabtree Island is the Chief Negotiator for one of them,
26:02.120 - 26:06.480:  the Screen Actors Guild, which has 160,000 members around the world.
26:06.880 - 26:09.320:  Michelle Hasein asked him how negotiations were going.
26:09.940 - 26:12.100:  We've been on strike since July 14.
26:12.100 - 26:16.160:  Our last day of bargaining with the companies represented by the AMPTP,
26:16.160 - 26:18.920:  which is the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television producers.
26:19.400 - 26:22.260:  We have not had any further communication with them.
26:22.260 - 26:24.460:  We've said every day that we're ready,
26:24.460 - 26:26.060:  willing and able to continue bargaining,
26:26.660 - 26:28.400:  but they have not been willing to do that.
26:28.420 - 26:31.220:  They have, however, reengaged recently with the writer's guild,
26:31.480 - 26:34.520:  and they're in a pattern of discussions with them right now.
26:34.780 - 26:39.120:  That is the alliance that negotiates on behalf of companies like Netflix,
26:39.120 - 26:41.180:  Disney, Warner Brothers, Discovery.
26:41.780 - 26:46.160:  Do they recognize that there's been a big change to livelihoods,
26:46.160 - 26:49.740:  that you have the old days where programs would be syndicated across
26:50.220 - 26:54.840:  ad-supported networks and that your members' incomes have changed
26:55.320 - 26:56.920:  since streaming took hold?
26:57.100 - 26:59.640:  I mean, they must recognise that it's undeniable,
27:00.220 - 27:04.260:  but they don't seem to recognise it in terms of being willing to make any changes
27:04.260 - 27:07.120:  to the contracts, and that's one of the reasons why our president,
27:07.120 - 27:08.440:  Fran Dresher and I have said,
27:08.960 - 27:12.360:  these companies have unilaterally changed the entire business model
27:12.580 - 27:14.580:  of the industry, of the entertainment industry,
27:14.740 - 27:18.420:  but they want to hold the contracts of performers and writers,
27:18.420 - 27:22.240:  another creative talent frozen in amber like we're back in the 90s,
27:22.240 - 27:23.640:  even though the whole business has changed.
27:24.180 - 27:26.020:  So they really have to rethink that,
27:26.020 - 27:29.000:  or there's no way to move forward without them being willing
27:29.560 - 27:31.480:  to recognise the change that's happened.
27:31.780 - 27:34.380:  It is a high-stakes move as new because the strike is also
27:34.380 - 27:38.000:  affecting the incomes of your members and others
27:38.420 - 27:41.260:  as it goes on with not only current production,
27:41.260 - 27:43.880:  halted, but it's affecting what people are pitching,
27:43.880 - 27:46.440:  what they're writing, the whole pipeline of the industry.
27:46.960 - 27:49.780:  That's true, and this was not a decision that was taken lightly,
27:49.780 - 27:52.820:  but I think it's really important to recognise that we bargained
27:52.980 - 27:55.380:  with the studios and streamers for 35 days.
27:55.980 - 27:59.640:  We extended our contract by an additional 12 days in order to allow
27:59.640 - 28:00.840:  for more bargaining time.
28:01.040 - 28:04.340:  And in the end, the companies refused to do even basic things
28:04.340 - 28:07.240:  like agree to have an increase in minimum compensation
28:07.260 - 28:10.880:  to keep up with inflation, or agree to limit the use
28:10.920 - 28:13.160:  of artificial intelligence so that people have a right
28:13.160 - 28:15.740:  to have informed consent over the use of their image
28:15.880 - 28:17.340:  and the creation of a digital replica,
28:17.640 - 28:21.280:  or even share any kind of revenue from the revenue
28:21.280 - 28:22.780:  that the streaming companies are making
28:23.300 - 28:24.760:  off of these new platforms that have been created.
28:24.760 - 28:26.200:  I mean, these are very basic proposals,
28:26.200 - 28:29.180:  all of which the companies refused to make a deal.
28:29.400 - 28:30.860:  So the responsibility for these strikes
28:30.860 - 28:33.880:  rests squarely on the shoulders of the AMPTP companies,
28:33.880 - 28:35.200:  the studios and the streamers.
28:35.720 - 28:37.480:  And I think everyone realises that.
28:37.480 - 28:39.740:  That's why we have such widespread support from the public
28:39.740 - 28:41.220:  and from the rest of the industry.
28:41.900 - 28:44.380:  Duncan Crapry Island with Michelle Hasein.
28:44.880 - 28:47.800:  Finally, to Delhi, where monkeys are often spotted
28:47.800 - 28:50.560:  roaming around government sites in the Indian capital,
28:50.560 - 28:53.040:  much to the irritation of the local authorities.
28:53.680 - 28:56.500:  As it prepares to host the G20 summit of world leaders
28:56.500 - 28:59.360:  in September, the city is reverting to a tried
28:59.360 - 29:01.640:  and tested method to stop these macaques,
29:01.640 - 29:02.560:  bothering people.
29:03.080 - 29:05.960:  The plan though is quite noisy, as Shantar Hartel explains.
29:11.300 - 29:13.520:  This is the sound of a langa monkey,
29:13.520 - 29:17.340:  a large blackface long-tailed primate known for its
29:17.520 - 29:19.420:  unusual barking call.
29:19.960 - 29:22.660:  For decades, trained handlers would take langas
29:22.680 - 29:25.980:  into public spaces to scare away Delhi's smaller monkeys
29:25.980 - 29:28.780:  to make sure that major events ran smoothly.
29:29.380 - 29:31.940:  That practice ended due to animal welfare laws.
29:32.640 - 29:36.500:  So, New Delhi's municipal council has gone for the next best thing,
29:37.140 - 29:40.580:  hiring around 30 men tasked with mimicking the sounds
29:40.580 - 29:41.780:  of the langa monkey.
29:42.020 - 29:46.060:  A council official said one man would be deployed at each hotel
29:46.060 - 29:48.220:  where G20 delegates are staying,
29:48.700 - 29:50.620:  as well as other popular monkey spots.
29:51.340 - 29:53.300:  So, how realistic will it be?
29:53.960 - 29:56.640:  Here's one impersonator who was employed previously
29:56.640 - 29:58.920:  to stop monkey's bothering bureaucrats
29:58.920 - 30:00.300:  around the Indian Parliament.
30:02.400 - 30:03.700:  This is to scare the monkey away.
30:03.700 - 30:06.400:  The monkey thinks a langa is around the corner and this one
30:07.280 - 30:07.880:  and then this one.
30:09.300 - 30:10.220:  That's to scare them away.
30:10.640 - 30:12.660:  We mix all three sounds so the monkeys think
30:12.660 - 30:14.240:  that a man has come with a langa.
30:14.720 - 30:17.620:  The authorities are also putting up cardboard cutouts
30:17.620 - 30:21.380:  of the macaques more menacing relatives in parts of the city.
30:22.080 - 30:25.460:  But some are skeptical about how effective this will be.
30:25.880 - 30:28.140:  The animals have a reputation for being quick
30:28.140 - 30:29.460:  to spot these tricks.
30:29.960 - 30:33.020:  Previously, a fake plastic model of a langa monkey
30:33.020 - 30:36.700:  with its distinct loud noise lasted only three days
30:36.700 - 30:38.960:  before macaques tore it to pieces.
30:39.740 - 30:40.920:  Shut our heartle reporting.
