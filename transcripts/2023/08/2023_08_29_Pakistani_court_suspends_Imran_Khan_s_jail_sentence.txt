00:55.660 - 01:02.540:  I'm Nigel Adely and at 13 hours GMT on Tuesday the 29th of August, these are our main stories.
01:03.480 - 01:09.660:  The former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has a jail sentence suspended but he may not be freed.
01:10.620 - 01:15.740:  The head of these Sudanese military is in Egypt, on his first trip abroad since fighting
01:15.740 - 01:22.120:  erupting in Khartoum in April. Japan urges China to ensure the safety of Japanese residents
01:22.140 - 01:27.940:  after a wave of harassment linked to the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.
01:31.160 - 01:36.320:  Also in this podcast, a new study shows that living in an area with poor air quality
01:36.860 - 01:42.340:  can take an average of more than two years of life expectancy. And we hear from the medical team
01:42.340 - 01:47.960:  in Australia that removed a live worm from a woman's brain. One of our neurocedence
01:47.960 - 01:53.640:  took a biopsy of wondering if cancer is an abscess and she and everyone that operating
01:53.640 - 01:57.940:  data was shocked when she pulled out a wriggling eight centimeter worm.
02:02.480 - 02:07.360:  A Pakistani court has suspended Imran Khan's three-year sentence for corruption.
02:08.100 - 02:13.080:  The former Prime Minister was found guilty earlier this month of concealing information about
02:13.080 - 02:17.520:  state gifts he'd received and selling them for as much as $600,000.
02:18.780 - 02:23.360:  Although the Islamabad High Court granted him bail until the result of his appeal is heard,
02:23.360 - 02:29.500:  it's unlikely that Mr. Khan will be released from jail immediately. His lawyers are trying to stop
02:29.500 - 02:35.980:  other arrests against him in separate cases. Speaking outside the court, Mr. Khan's lawyer Gauha Khan
02:35.980 - 02:39.620:  said he hoped the court would roll in his favor as soon as possible.
02:40.140 - 02:44.660:  We are very hopeful he would be released so far. We have not been informed that he is under arrest
02:44.660 - 02:48.900:  in any other case. If they are going to arrest him in other cases or strategy is already online,
02:48.900 - 02:53.200:  we have filed cases in the High Court in Supreme Court and we are seeking the court to restrain
02:53.200 - 02:57.800:  the prosecution who are arresting him in any other case. And soon in Shallatala,
02:58.120 - 02:59.980:  Imran Khan would be out of jail in this case.
03:00.380 - 03:05.720:  I asked our correspondent in Islamabad Caroline Davis what difference this ruling will make.
03:06.440 - 03:11.480:  In the reality of whether he's coming out of jail or not, it might not mean any difference at all.
03:12.000 - 03:17.800:  His lawyers appeared in front of court. Today they were told that his jail sentence has now
03:17.800 - 03:23.500:  been suspended. That is until the appeal is heard and then decided about this particular case,
03:23.500 - 03:27.000:  which as you mentioned is the Toshikana case. So this was the case that he was found guilty of
03:27.000 - 03:32.440:  at the beginning of this month, that he was found guilty of not having declared the money that he
03:32.440 - 03:38.580:  gained from selling state gifts. He is no longer in prison because of that particular reason and
03:38.580 - 03:45.460:  that particular case. However, there are multiple other cases against Imran Khan and many of those
03:45.460 - 03:52.180:  also have warrant out for his arrest too. So when we initially spoke to his lawyers after this result,
03:52.180 - 03:57.260:  they said that they were planning to go and try and get bail on all of these other cases to stop
03:57.260 - 04:02.620:  him from being arrested again immediately and staying within jail. Then within the matter of
04:02.620 - 04:07.680:  sort of 20 minutes or so, it became clear that there was already an arrest warrant that had been
04:07.680 - 04:14.300:  in place while he's been in prison on another case altogether, which technically runs out tomorrow
04:14.300 - 04:19.140:  when we are expected to hear another case with Imran Khan. But I think it became increasingly
04:19.140 - 04:24.440:  clear that Imran Khan is probably very unlikely to be coming out of jail. Even his own lawyers
04:24.440 - 04:29.900:  started saying that the chances of getting out was about 30% chance. And I think with this sort
04:29.900 - 04:33.680:  of discovery and realization that this other case already meant that he was going to have to stay
04:33.680 - 04:38.100:  in jail, they really thought actually it's going to be quite difficult to try to get this form of
04:38.100 - 04:43.740:  bail to get him released. So the reality is, despite this sentence being temporarily suspended
04:43.740 - 04:48.560:  until his appeal is heard, it looks very unlikely that Imran Khan is coming out of jail anytime soon.
04:49.000 - 04:53.560:  And his long term aim, of course, is to try and stand in elections again. Does today make any
04:53.560 - 04:59.540:  difference for that aim? No, not at all. At the moment, the sentence still stands that appeal has
04:59.540 - 05:05.400:  not been heard. Imran Khan is still disqualified. And at the moment, we still don't have a date set
05:05.620 - 05:09.800:  for the general elections in Pakistan, even though we currently have a caretaker government,
05:09.800 - 05:15.580:  which takes over in the months preceding an election, but still no election date. And Imran Khan
05:15.580 - 05:21.920:  is still very much disqualified. Caroline Davis, new research on air quality and its impact on people's
05:21.920 - 05:27.920:  health, makes for grim reading. On average, air pollution can take more than two years of life
05:28.640 - 05:34.680:  expectancy. And that increases significantly if you live in China, Nigeria, and South Asia.
05:35.380 - 05:40.080:  Our South Asian correspondent Samira Hussein told us more about the findings of the report.
05:41.160 - 05:48.460:  Basically, if you are breathing poor air, it can wipe out anywhere from one to six years off your
05:48.460 - 05:55.420:  life expectancy. And in some areas, that's actually more than the adverse effects of smoking,
05:55.580 - 06:03.160:  of HIV AIDS, and of even malnutrition. It's really quite significant. And it's pretty startling
06:03.160 - 06:11.120:  to see that in, you know, just documented in this report. And how does air pollution affect daily
06:11.120 - 06:18.180:  life for, say, an average person in India? In India, you have different seasons. You have the
06:18.180 - 06:26.580:  monsoon season, and then you also have pollution season. And having seen, you know, the air pollution
06:26.580 - 06:31.500:  happen in other parts of the world, you look here in India, and there are days and weeks that
06:31.680 - 06:37.400:  schools can be closed, that people just don't go into their offices, that even transportation
06:37.400 - 06:44.660:  becomes difficult because visibility is poor. And also just the smog has such an impact on
06:44.660 - 06:50.700:  how much you're coughing and your eyes. And that isn't, that's just sort of an immediate impact.
06:50.700 - 06:56.080:  That's not even taking into account the life expectancy impact or the long-term health implications.
06:56.780 - 07:01.440:  And China has made big inroads into reducing air pollution. But what's happening elsewhere?
07:02.240 - 07:08.220:  Right. So China has been able, in 2013 China really made a concerted effort to reduce its air
07:08.340 - 07:14.520:  pollution. And so they moved away from coal burning to natural gas and really got rid of a lot of
07:14.520 - 07:21.640:  these old vehicles on their roads. You know, some say that, look, it's a bit easier for China to
07:21.640 - 07:27.580:  implement some of these rules because of their more authoritative regime. If you look at a country
07:27.900 - 07:35.620:  like India, it is a large wielding democracy. And it can sometimes be difficult to enact
07:35.620 - 07:42.100:  these kinds of new sort of legislations and rules and get a lot of buy-in when you have so
07:42.100 - 07:47.200:  many other pressing issues that are at play in the country. But if you look that since 2013,
07:47.200 - 07:54.400:  which is incidentally when China had enacted its Clean Air Act, we saw that about 59% of the global
07:54.400 - 08:01.320:  increase in pollution came from India alone. Samira Hussein in Delhi. Meanwhile, London has
08:01.320 - 08:07.880:  expanded the area in which drivers of the most polluting cars must pay a fee to drive. The zone,
08:07.880 - 08:14.420:  known as Yules, now covers the entire city. And while the plan is intended to improve air quality,
08:14.460 - 08:20.080:  it has been controversial. Many residents with older cars say they can't afford to pay the
08:20.080 - 08:25.720:  $15 charge. And they've criticised the scheme to reimburse them for scrapping their vehicles
08:26.360 - 08:31.460:  as insufficient. The Mayor of London, Saddi Khan, defended today's expansion.
08:32.500 - 08:37.000:  It was a difficult decision for me to take, but it's a vital one and the right one. And let me explain
08:37.000 - 08:42.820:  why. The evidence in relation to the consequences of air pollution are quite clear. In London,
08:42.900 - 08:49.140:  we see around 4,000 premises or deaths a year directly linked with air pollution. We've children
08:49.140 - 08:55.300:  who've got stunted lungs forever, adults with a hell host of health issues from cancer to dementia,
08:56.120 - 09:03.860:  heart disease to asthma. But also we know there's a policy that's effective at reducing air
09:04.080 - 09:08.880:  pollution. We know this because we started the Yules in Central London and sort of reduction
09:08.880 - 09:16.040:  of toxicity made the main pollutants by almost 50%. A third fewer children admitted to hospital
09:16.700 - 09:22.200:  with air pollution related illnesses. We expanded it to inner London and saw a reduction of 21%
09:22.300 - 09:28.240:  in the main pollutants, nitrogen dioxide. Children going to 1400 schools, breathing
09:28.780 - 09:33.700:  clean air, but it's in outer London where there's the biggest problems. We've not seen significant
09:33.700 - 09:40.040:  improvements. Saddi Khan, Japan has urged China to ensure the safety of Japanese residents
09:40.040 - 09:45.800:  and diplomatic missions. After a wave of harassment linked to the release of wastewater
09:45.900 - 09:52.160:  from the Fukushima nuclear plant, the Japanese foreign minister said Beijing should calm its
09:52.160 - 09:58.640:  citizens. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Japan must address the reason
09:58.640 - 10:06.320:  for the people's anger. Ignoring the strong doubts and opposition of the international community,
10:06.320 - 10:11.760:  the Japanese government unilaterally and forcibly started the discharge of contaminated water
10:12.140 - 10:16.640:  from the Fukushima nuclear accident which prompted strong indignation from people of all
10:16.640 - 10:22.420:  countries. This is the root cause of the current situation. If Japan's push to release contaminated
10:22.420 - 10:29.120:  water into the sea was based on science, why is the opposition in Japan still so difficult to
10:29.120 - 10:34.720:  quail? I asked our correspondent in the region, Jim McKenzie, about the Japanese concerns.
10:35.620 - 10:39.580:  Well, look, ever since Japan said it was going to release this water, China has been the
10:39.580 - 10:45.020:  loudest critic. So almost as soon as it started releasing this water last Thursday, China announced
10:45.020 - 10:50.440:  that it was going to ban all seafood from Japan. But the interesting thing is that this government
10:50.440 - 10:56.000:  opposition in the last few days seem to now kind of trickle down to the public. So Japan says that
10:56.000 - 11:01.700:  since the water was released, its businesses and schools in Fukushima have started receiving hundreds
11:01.700 - 11:08.160:  of abusive phone calls coming from Chinese callers. But then it said today that actually it's
11:08.220 - 11:12.480:  embassy in Beijing had been attacked so people had turned up at the embassy and started throwing
11:12.480 - 11:17.700:  pieces of bricks at it. So Japan has said that it's now so worried about its citizens in China,
11:17.700 - 11:21.980:  as well as its businesses over in Fukushima, but they just worried that citizens in China might be
11:21.980 - 11:27.400:  the target of abuse or a kind of revenge attack that it's now telling people in China to keep
11:27.400 - 11:33.080:  below profile. And what does it want from the Chinese authorities? So Japan has called this reaction
11:33.140 - 11:39.220:  worrying and regrettable. So it's urging China to tell its people to act calmly,
11:39.220 - 11:45.420:  begging them really to not inflame this situation. But we had a press briefing from the Chinese
11:45.420 - 11:50.720:  Foreign Minister yesterday and the Chinese were just kind of absolute that they always ensure
11:51.040 - 11:56.040:  the safety of foreigners they say. But again, it issued this warning to Japan that it wanted
11:56.040 - 12:00.960:  it to stop the release of this water. So China is really going for Japan over this issue.
12:01.580 - 12:05.680:  And at the moment, we've heard what they've said on what they want and this could be an
12:05.680 - 12:09.940:  impasse because the Japanese clearly believe they have to do this. Yeah, I don't think there's any
12:09.940 - 12:13.380:  indication that the Japanese are going to stop the release of this water. This is something
12:13.380 - 12:17.200:  they've been planning for many years and really something they felt they were left with no choice.
12:17.200 - 12:22.500:  I mean, this plant at Fukushima has been storing this water now for, you know, a decade,
12:22.500 - 12:27.240:  more than a decade and they'd filled a thousand of these massive tanks. They had to find a way
12:27.240 - 12:32.860:  to release it and that this plant has been signed off by the UN Nuclear Watchdog as safe.
12:32.860 - 12:38.540:  And all the testing that's been done so far in the days following the first release has shown
12:38.540 - 12:43.760:  that the radioactive levels in this water are within the safe range. But, you know, the issue for Japan
12:43.760 - 12:48.940:  is how it's going to be able to support its fishermen now if this Chinese boycott continues.
12:48.940 - 12:54.160:  Of course, you know, fishermen in Japan rely a lot on selling seafood. Is even some indication
12:54.240 - 12:58.720:  today from the Japanese that they might actually complain to the World Trade Organization now
12:58.720 - 13:05.060:  about this boycott from China? Jim McKenzie. In recent months, there have been so many twists and
13:05.060 - 13:10.460:  turns in the story of the Afghani Progojian and his Wagner-Mersenry group. There were Mr.
13:10.460 - 13:16.420:  Progojian's private jet crashed last week, reportedly killing all on board. There were some who
13:16.420 - 13:22.460:  suspected that wasn't the end of the story, that the incident had somehow been staged to allow
13:22.460 - 13:28.860:  the Wagner boss to disappear quietly into the sunset. But the Russian authorities insist that Mr.
13:28.860 - 13:33.880:  Progojian's body and the bodies of the other nine passengers and crew have been identified.
13:34.720 - 13:39.880:  And on Monday, the White House said it was increasingly confident the organic Progojian died
13:39.880 - 13:46.020:  in that plane crash. So, what did the Russian public make of all of this? A Russia editor Steve
13:46.020 - 13:52.180:  Rosenberg is in Moscow. You know, it never fails to astonish me. There could be such drama.
13:52.180 - 13:57.960:  Unfolding in Russia and yet come onto the streets of Moscow and you really couldn't tell that.
13:58.640 - 14:04.340:  I'm in a park close to the Kremlin where people are strolling in the late summer sunshine and
14:04.340 - 14:11.060:  there are kids whizzing by on scooters and lots of Russians taking selfies with St. Basil's Cathedral
14:11.060 - 14:18.160:  in the background. It all looks very calm and very relaxed and yet this is a country that is
14:18.160 - 14:24.300:  currently fighting a war, having attacked and invaded its neighbour, Ukraine. And this is also a
14:24.300 - 14:30.180:  country where things happen in the most suspicious of circumstances. And just a few days ago,
14:30.180 - 14:37.120:  a private jet crashed 60 miles from here, killing 10 people, including the Russian mercenary chief
14:37.400 - 14:43.320:  Yvgeny Progojian, the man behind the Wagner mutiny. That made headlines around the world.
14:44.260 - 14:46.780:  But I wonder what people in Moscow are making of it.
14:50.720 - 14:56.920:  I'm not happy, more sad about it, says Nina, but I do think that Yvgeny only has himself to blame.
14:57.740 - 15:02.600:  Then I speak to Ari. Does he believe that the Kremlin was behind the crash?
15:03.380 - 15:09.980:  If the Russian government did it, so it's very bad for them, because he was very helpful
15:10.860 - 15:17.720:  for the Russian government. Was he popular in Russia? He and his Wagner PMC were like heroes in Russia,
15:18.040 - 15:22.920:  he is very, very popular. He said where we pop your things, he criticized the Russian government
15:22.920 - 15:26.780:  and he said what people wanted to hear from him.
15:30.340 - 15:35.740:  Well I'm outside a church now, right opposite Red Square, and here on the pavement there is a
15:35.740 - 15:42.100:  makeshift shrine dedicated to the memory of Yvgeny Progojian and to his Wagner colleagues.
15:42.120 - 15:49.180:  There is a sea of red carnations and red roses. People are stopping to light candles here
15:49.180 - 15:56.100:  and crossing themselves in Russian Orthodox style. Some people are putting sweets and even
15:56.100 - 16:02.380:  cigarettes by the flowers. But I can see the report traits here of Mr. Progojian and of his
16:02.740 - 16:08.140:  right hand man Dmitri Utkin. Let me read you some of the posters that have been put up. One
16:08.140 - 16:15.680:  declares a warrior lives forever, another to the fallen fighters of Wagner. And there is one
16:15.680 - 16:22.460:  here that says simply thank you uncle Yvgeny. It's clear that to many of the people coming here,
16:22.460 - 16:32.100:  stopping here, Yvgeny Progojian is a hero. I've served in the regular army and I've served
16:32.100 - 16:38.920:  with Wagner and a toly tells me. Progojian would spend whatever it took to kid out his fighters.
16:45.700 - 16:50.340:  Well that's what the Russian public is saying, but what about the Russian media? Mr.
16:50.340 - 16:55.840:  Progojian's death has been a huge story internationally, but on Russian TV's flagship
16:55.840 - 17:01.820:  weekend news show, the plane crash was very low down the running order. Some of the coverage here
17:02.060 - 17:08.480:  aims to make the West look bad. I've got some audio here on my phone, it's from a Russian TV talk show.
17:09.000 - 17:18.880:  Take a listen. So the presenter is mocking a whole bunch of foreign newspapers for running the
17:18.880 - 17:25.800:  same front page headline. It's Putin's revenge. They're using the same playbook, she says.
17:27.120 - 17:31.540:  Now many here do suspect that the Russian authorities were behind this crash.
17:32.340 - 17:37.360:  So the Kremlin is using the media to try to move attention away from itself,
17:38.140 - 17:44.400:  to ensure that the death of a mercenary chief does not weaken the position of the president.
17:49.700 - 18:00.780:  Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. Still to come. It makes me really angry, of course it does.
18:00.960 - 18:05.460:  They call themselves environmentalists, but uprooting trees is against nature.
18:06.080 - 18:11.660:  We have a special report on the conflict in the French countryside between farmers and environmental
18:12.460 - 18:12.480:  activists.
18:19.640 - 18:23.600:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
18:23.760 - 18:29.520:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
18:29.520 - 18:33.960:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
18:34.080 - 18:39.320:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad guy as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos really
18:39.320 - 18:44.400:  did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars, listen to Good Bad
18:44.700 - 18:49.280:  Billionaire with me Simon Jack and me Zingsing available now wherever you get your podcasts.
18:56.620 - 19:02.240:  The head of the Sudanese Armed Forces General Abdel Fata Al-Burhan is in Egypt to be
19:02.240 - 19:08.300:  president Abdel Fata Al-CC. It's the first time Sudan's military ruler has left the country
19:08.840 - 19:14.340:  since internal conflict broke out in April between the army and the paramilitary rapid support
19:14.860 - 19:20.660:  forces. More details from Will Ross. Up until just a few days ago the Sudanese military leader
19:20.660 - 19:25.200:  was holed up inside the army headquarters in Khartoum. The fact that General Abdel Fata Al-Burhan has
19:25.200 - 19:29.820:  now been able to leave the country for talks with his ally in Egypt is for some a sign that the
19:29.820 - 19:34.620:  army is under less pressure. The rival rapid support forces may have been weakened in the capital,
19:34.620 - 19:39.980:  but in Darfur the RSF is still strong and has been behind ethnically motivated attacks.
19:40.140 - 19:45.760:  On Monday General Al-Burhan dismissed the idea of peace talks and spoke about defeating the rebellion.
19:45.900 - 19:51.200:  Many Sudanese seeing their country being steadily destroyed will be hoping that behind the scenes
19:51.200 - 19:55.660:  regional leaders are pushing for another attempt at negotiating an end to the war.
19:57.300 - 20:03.320:  Will Ross. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have strongly condemned the
20:03.320 - 20:09.740:  influence of white supremacy in the US. That follows confirmation from authorities in Florida
20:09.740 - 20:15.140:  that the fatal shooting over the weekend of three black people in the city of Jacksonville
20:15.600 - 20:20.960:  was racially motivated. The pair made the comments while speaking at the gathering of civil rights
20:20.960 - 20:27.680:  leaders to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the march on Washington led by the trailblazing
20:27.680 - 20:35.280:  African-American minister Martin Luther King, Jr. So how pervasive is white supremacy in American
20:35.280 - 20:41.440:  society? Rob Young asked the Reverend Dr. Jackie Lewis, a senior minister at Middle Collegiate
20:41.440 - 20:49.920:  Church in New York for her views. White supremacist ideologies have become an epidemic in the United
20:49.920 - 20:55.940:  States. It is not the first time we've been here. I'm an African-American person so I understand
20:55.980 - 21:04.480:  that our economy, our society was built on enslaving Africans and oppressing other racial ethnic
21:04.480 - 21:11.200:  minorities. And then we've had decades of progressive accomplishments that have brought us to a
21:11.200 - 21:19.180:  place where in America we sort of feel like our Constitution speaks truth. We can all have
21:19.180 - 21:28.280:  liberty and justice. We can all be free. But there has been, since 2016 or so, a kind of backlash
21:29.200 - 21:37.780:  where there's so much anger, a resentment, a feeling of being displaced by many white Americans
21:37.780 - 21:45.180:  that this dream that was of their dream has been taken away from them because of the accomplishments,
21:45.180 - 21:53.160:  the opportunities of others. And what we see in this shooting where someone is hunting black people
21:53.840 - 22:03.520:  is the accumulation of anti-black rhetoric. So you're saying that we're not just seeing individual racist
22:03.520 - 22:10.400:  attacks, but this is part of a broader structural racist system within the United States.
22:11.140 - 22:18.460:  I would say that, sir, and I'm a pastor and I'm a psychologist and I study movements and I would
22:18.460 - 22:28.440:  say this is a movement. I would say this is a curated, cultivated movement against blackness
22:29.180 - 22:37.180:  that frankly starts with Thomas Jefferson and his notes on the state of Virginia where he has a
22:37.180 - 22:45.540:  suspicion that black people are inferior to whites and it is built into law, it's built into an
22:45.540 - 22:52.380:  economy. Like the economy of America is built on the backs of African people. I would say the
22:52.380 - 22:58.280:  anomaly are the seasons of black flourishing, right? The seasons of black power, the seasons of black
22:58.280 - 23:05.940:  equality, the election of President Obama. I think white people in America, some of them lost their
23:05.940 - 23:15.960:  minds when we elected a black man as President and now Trumpism, DeSantisism has given license
23:15.980 - 23:24.120:  to this kind of violence that would stop black flourishing. The White House has said that the
23:24.120 - 23:31.780:  US needs to tackle white supremacy. How do you practically tackle this issue? I'm a pastor of the most
23:31.780 - 23:40.380:  incredible multi-ethnic, multi-racial, multi-gendered, queer-affirming community called Middle Church.
23:41.500 - 23:49.060:  And how I tackle this is every day creating opportunities for people to find what I would call
23:49.060 - 23:57.260:  a boom to. I am who I am because you are who you are. To disrupt the racism and white supremacist
23:57.260 - 24:04.080:  ideology in America is to create laboratories of community. That's a mindset change then,
24:04.080 - 24:09.980:  but I wonder practically, politically, what do you want to hear or perhaps not hear from some of
24:09.980 - 24:15.920:  the current crop of political leaders in America? Thank you for that beautiful question. I want the
24:15.920 - 24:23.380:  mindset change. Many of the people who are speaking these white supremacist ideologies say their
24:23.380 - 24:32.240:  Christians. The mindset change starts with our core beliefs. Let's in that love as a public
24:32.240 - 24:39.800:  ethic. The Reverend Dr. Jackie Lewis speaking to Rob Young. The French countryside has become the
24:39.800 - 24:45.620:  setting for increasingly violent attacks by environmental activists against farms and agriculture.
24:46.520 - 24:52.060:  In the South activists recently destroyed several thousand young apple trees after their owner
24:52.060 - 24:58.400:  who had gone organic switched back to conventional farming. This report from John Lawrence and
24:58.400 - 25:09.100:  not far from the town of Levant. Far manager Michel Vieira snaps off an apple tree shoot.
25:09.100 - 25:16.880:  That's what they did, he says, 18,000 times. Outside this three hectare plot, apples are ripening
25:16.880 - 25:22.680:  in the summer heat. But here, where six farm workers spent a good part of spring grafting young
25:22.680 - 25:28.500:  trees onto rootstock, their work was destroyed in one night by a group of what the French government
25:28.500 - 25:37.900:  now calls eco terrorists. It makes me really angry, of course it does. They call themselves
25:37.900 - 25:45.140:  environmentalists, but uprooting trees is against nature. 2023 has seen a sharp increase in what
25:45.140 - 25:50.520:  French environmentalists themselves call operation coup de poire punch operations.
25:56.580 - 26:01.240:  The biggest was that a place called Saint Soline in the west of France where thousands of
26:01.240 - 26:06.700:  activists trying to stop farmers building a reservoir fought a pitch battle with thousands of
26:06.700 - 26:14.240:  Jean-Dame. 250 people were injured, 50 seriously, five critically. The government banned a group
26:14.240 - 26:20.480:  called Earth Uprising after Saint Soline, though that ban has now been suspended by the Constitutional
26:20.480 - 26:26.580:  Council. Among other recent incidents, militants entered greenhouse and destroyed lily of the valley,
26:26.580 - 26:33.060:  accused of using too much water and sand, and lettuces said to be experimental and chemical
26:33.060 - 26:40.220:  fertiliser dependent. Back in Lavois, Mayor Berna Carillon says, a mysterious group calling itself
26:40.220 - 26:46.120:  the Thistle that has claimed responsibility for the apple farm attack is typical of a new,
26:46.120 - 26:53.920:  very left-wing eco-extremism. In its communique, this group aligns itself with a radical
26:53.920 - 26:58.900:  environmentalism that is on the rise in France. It treats its adversaries as enemies because they
26:58.900 - 27:02.800:  are in favour of economic growth and believe that it's thanks to research and industry that we are
27:02.800 - 27:14.360:  going to meet the challenge of climate change. A donkey snorts in a field belonging to a smallholder
27:14.360 - 27:20.840:  Jean-Luc Ervee, a member of the peasant's confederation, an environmentally radical farmers union
27:20.840 - 27:26.820:  founded by the sheepbreeder José Bové, who made a name for himself by dismantling as he put it
27:26.820 - 27:34.080:  in McDonald's and destroying fields of genetically modified maize. Monsieur Ervee says he understands
27:34.080 - 27:42.780:  the attack on the Lavois farm. This industrial structure has been committing environmental
27:42.800 - 27:48.260:  irregularities for years, pesticide spraying in windy weather, or when they let fires to protect
27:48.260 - 27:53.260:  their trees from the frost and sent 20 people to hostile with smoke and toxication. So this sort
27:53.260 - 28:02.200:  of reaction that might be regrettable is to be expected. A recent poll shows 85 percent of
28:02.200 - 28:07.840:  French people oppose the sort of direct action increasingly adopted by environmentalists in
28:07.840 - 28:14.180:  France, but the eco-radical minority is an active one following the ill-fated banning of the
28:14.180 - 28:20.840:  earth uprising collective. 180 groups were formed around the country in support of the organization.
28:21.780 - 28:24.900:  This war in the French countryside has perhaps only just begun.
28:26.360 - 28:32.840:  John Lawrence and reporting. Now, those of you with a squeamish disposition may want to cover your
28:32.840 - 28:40.020:  ears. Surgeons in Australia have pulled an 8 cm long parasitic roundworm, alive and
28:40.020 - 28:47.600:  wriggling from the brain of a patient. Sanjaya Sanjana Yake, associate professor of medicine at the
28:47.600 - 28:54.220:  Australian National University, based at Canberra Hospital, told Michelle Hussain, first about the
28:54.220 - 29:01.380:  patient. Started off many months before the brain surgery when she presented with these sort of
29:01.380 - 29:08.040:  non-specific symptoms, diarrhea, tummy pain, a cough, and she had abnormalities on a cat scan
29:08.040 - 29:13.340:  in her liver and her lungs. And at that time, there were lots of diagnostic possibilities.
29:13.340 - 29:20.200:  Then, clever person decided to do an MRI of the brain and found an abnormality in the front
29:20.200 - 29:26.340:  part of her brain. So, she came back to our hospital and one of our neurosurgeons took a biopsy
29:26.340 - 29:32.880:  of it, wondering if cancer is an abscess, is it something else? And she and everyone that operating
29:32.880 - 29:38.120:  theatre were shocked when with some force, if she pulled out a wriggling 8 cm worm.
29:38.620 - 29:45.180:  It was very much alive and we sent it to a parasitologist up the road in Canberra,
29:45.180 - 29:50.740:  who specialised in animal parasites and it was alive when he got it too, but then he killed it.
29:50.740 - 29:56.260:  Have you ever seen anything like that or heard of cases like that? Had this essentially moved
29:56.260 - 30:04.400:  all the way through her body and grown in her body? Look, this is an unusual case because it's
30:04.400 - 30:10.100:  the first time that this particular parasite has been found to infect a human. So, it's another
30:10.100 - 30:17.180:  new infection in the world. In terms of do we ever see worms appear in brains that has happened
30:17.180 - 30:24.000:  before, but certainly the way in which this happened and discovered was a very dramatic scenario
30:24.000 - 30:30.140:  indeed. How would she have become infected with it? So, to understand that, we need to understand
30:30.140 - 30:37.880:  the life cycle of the parasite. Now, normally it lives in carpet python, so snakes, and it's
30:37.880 - 30:45.300:  excreted in the poo or the feces of the snake, which has got the parasite eggs in it. What we
30:45.300 - 30:53.120:  hypothesise here is that this lady, our patient, collected local grasses, native grasses, which
30:53.120 - 30:58.520:  she used for cooking, and we think those grasses would have been contaminated by python feces and
30:58.520 - 31:05.100:  the parasite eggs. So, through those contaminated grasses, she would have become infected herself.
31:05.420 - 31:11.060:  How did she react when she came round and was told what you'd found? We're all horrified and we're
31:11.060 - 31:16.960:  many degrees separated from her. So, it was that poor lady's brain that was involved. So, obviously,
31:17.020 - 31:23.660:  she was horrified, but at the same time, we finally had a diagnosis for her. We finally had
31:23.660 - 31:29.660:  an opportunity to give directed treatment for her. So, I think there was relief as well as horror.
