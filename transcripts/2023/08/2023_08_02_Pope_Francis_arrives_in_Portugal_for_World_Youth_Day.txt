00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.680:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.780 - 00:24.100:  I'm Janet Gillil and at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday the 2nd of August, these are our main stories.
00:24.720 - 00:30.860:  Pope Francis is attending a huge gathering of young Catholics in Portugal as he tries to reach out
00:30.860 - 00:38.300:  to future generations. Russia strikes Ukraine's main inland port, sending global food prices higher.
00:39.060 - 00:44.840:  The US singer Lizzo is accused of sexual harassment and weight-shaming by former backup dancers.
00:45.240 - 00:54.940:  Also in this podcast, Russians took my best life, best years of life. They took the childhood
00:54.940 - 01:01.460:  of my baby, that's why they are targeted now. We hear from a female Ukrainian sniper.
01:06.380 - 01:11.260:  It's an opportunity for young Catholics from all over the world to come together to celebrate
01:11.260 - 01:17.040:  their religion. A million people are expected in the Portuguese capital Lisbon this week to mark
01:17.040 - 01:23.780:  World Youth Day. And it's also an opportunity for Pope Francis to reach out to the next generations.
01:24.520 - 01:29.640:  The 86 year old pontiff arrived in a wheelchair to be greeted by a military band.
01:35.340 - 01:40.720:  But the shadow of the church's child sex abuse scandals hangs over this jamboree.
01:41.340 - 01:45.260:  Including one in Portugal, which led to a scathing report six months ago.
01:45.820 - 01:50.340:  And there are also questions about the Pope's health after he had surgery in June.
01:51.000 - 01:53.360:  Addison Roberts in Lisbon told us more.
01:54.120 - 02:00.520:  This last night's opening mass without the Pope there were an estimated 200,000 youngsters and
02:00.520 - 02:05.120:  others gathered in central Lisbon. He's got a relatively quiet day-to-day, mainly diplomatic
02:05.120 - 02:11.000:  meetings and a number of clerics. It's at the end of the day tomorrow that he's going to
02:11.000 - 02:16.940:  preside over the big welcome ceremony downtown in Lisbon. And then at the weekend on Saturday and
02:16.940 - 02:25.320:  Sunday, he's going to preside over what will be huge gatherings outside of Lisbon in what is
02:25.320 - 02:29.400:  the actually the longest trip by any Pope to Portugal at any time.
02:30.020 - 02:35.200:  And this trip comes at a sensitive time for the Catholic Church. As in so many other countries
02:35.200 - 02:39.520:  in Portugal, there has been a sex abuse scandal in a recent damning report.
02:40.580 - 02:45.000:  That's right. At the beginning of this year, an independent commission set up by the Portuguese
02:45.000 - 02:51.660:  Catholic Church under some pressure from inside and outside. It has to be said, was a really devastating
02:51.660 - 02:58.180:  document that it produced estimating just on the basis of the witnesses and alleged victims
02:58.180 - 03:04.900:  who came forward that there were something like 4,800 victims, cases of abuse over the decades
03:04.900 - 03:10.640:  since 1950. And the church didn't handle that particularly well, so that's also damaged its
03:10.640 - 03:17.220:  image somewhat among the wider public. But still here, 80% of people in Portugal say that they're
03:17.220 - 03:22.060:  Catholics, although a much, much smaller proportion, perhaps only one quarter of that are actually
03:22.060 - 03:27.400:  practicing Catholics. And meanwhile, there are ongoing concerns about the Pope's health. This
03:27.400 - 03:32.700:  trip comes what two months after he had that surgery. That's right. There were some doubts as to
03:32.700 - 03:37.000:  whether he wouldn't make it. This, it was announced some months ago that he would be coming,
03:37.000 - 03:42.240:  there were doubts before that. And you can see from the program that it's quite carefully arranged,
03:42.240 - 03:48.300:  there are many quite small scale events, as I say. But it will be quite wearing, I would imagine,
03:48.300 - 03:53.600:  on Saturday night and then again on Sunday morning very early, residing over these massive events
03:53.640 - 03:58.420:  in what is likely to be quite a hot weather environment.
03:59.600 - 04:05.280:  Alison Roberts in Lisbon. Global grain prices have risen even higher after Russia
04:05.280 - 04:12.340:  attacked Ukraine's main inland port on the Danube River, close to Romania, which is a NATO member.
04:12.880 - 04:18.880:  The port has become an increasingly important export route since Russia reintroduced its blockade
04:18.880 - 04:25.140:  of Ukraine's Black Sea ports last month. Our key of correspondent James Waterhouse told us more
04:25.140 - 04:32.600:  about the attack and its impact. The damage is extensive. We've seen images of a massive
04:32.600 - 04:38.960:  burning warehouse with, we're told, a crane has been damaged as well as a, as a passenger terminal.
04:39.600 - 04:46.640:  And it's in the Ismail area of southern Ukraine right on the southern tip on the mouth of the Danube.
04:46.680 - 04:53.400:  And we're only talking about it being a few kilometers from Romania, which is on the other
04:53.400 - 04:58.700:  bank of the river, which is a NATO member. So these drone strikes which happened overnight
04:59.720 - 05:05.100:  have been condemned by Romania and it would have put the NATO alliance in quite a difficult position
05:05.100 - 05:11.280:  if one of those drones, which are not always accurate, had made its way across the river. But this
05:11.280 - 05:19.840:  is Russia continuing to target port infrastructure along the part of the Ukrainian coast, which it
05:19.840 - 05:26.340:  doesn't occupy. It's a sort of continuation of that tactic since pulling out of a major initiative
05:26.340 - 05:33.320:  a couple of weeks ago, which allowed Ukraine to export grain through and agree through the Black Sea.
05:34.100 - 05:41.340:  So the next best thing for cargo vessels is seen as the Danube River. But it is problematic,
05:41.340 - 05:48.060:  you know, it's seen as logistically more expensive. It's feared Ukrainian exports will shrink by
05:48.060 - 05:53.260:  a further half. And now you have Russia targeting these kind of buildings. And I think what
05:53.560 - 05:58.740:  Moscow is trying to do is damage confidence with the international companies that export grain.
05:59.440 - 06:05.120:  Yes, and we've already seen grain prices jumping in reaction to this attack. We know that millions
06:05.120 - 06:11.940:  of people worldwide rely on this grain. What is Russia's ultimate aim in carrying out such
06:11.940 - 06:18.040:  attacks, given the hardship and suffering it's likely to cause? It's invasion is faltering,
06:18.040 - 06:23.600:  it's stuttering. There is no clear aim to it. It's taken a fifth of Ukraine. It's not going to
06:23.600 - 06:27.920:  want to let it go. And so I think this is the Kremlin trying to hurt Ukraine in just about
06:28.620 - 06:35.180:  every way possible. But also, I think it's the Kremlin sees this as an opportunity to leverage the
06:35.180 - 06:43.060:  over the issue of sanctions because on the writing of this agreement, it is allowed to export its own
06:43.060 - 06:48.780:  agricultural products like fertilizer. But western sanctions have made that extremely difficult
06:48.780 - 06:52.820:  for Russia where yes, they might be able to load a cargo vessel, but they can't get insurance
06:52.820 - 06:59.960:  for it. And some western ports won't accept these ships. And secondly, when it comes to spare parts
06:59.960 - 07:07.720:  for farming equipment, there are limitations on how Russia can import those kind of things.
07:08.100 - 07:13.920:  So these are the demands that Russia is making. And it'll be interesting to see whether any of them
07:14.240 - 07:19.300:  can be met by through either Turkey or the United Nations because if any of those demands are met,
07:19.300 - 07:26.320:  that would amount to a relaxation of sanctions by western allies in the hope that it would throttle
07:26.320 - 07:32.900:  Russia's invasion. It will be quite a move. But here we are in this standoff where at the heart of it
07:32.900 - 07:38.580:  are people at risk of starvation. James Waterhouse, and staying with the war in Ukraine,
07:38.580 - 07:45.080:  while Moscow has used disinformation to try to win hearts and minds in occupied parts of the country
07:45.080 - 07:52.540:  since its annexation of Crimea in 2014, such propaganda has become increasingly targeted,
07:53.260 - 08:00.820:  honing in on Ukrainian frontline female soldiers in particular. Olga Malchewska has traveled to
08:00.820 - 08:12.560:  Ukraine to investigate. In the corner of a gym, a small dark head woman works out.
08:15.380 - 08:19.440:  But this is no ordinary gym, and she is no ordinary woman.
08:19.640 - 08:23.460:  My name is Andriana. I'm Ukrainian. I'm a service woman.
08:23.640 - 08:28.720:  Andriana is a female soldier in the special units of the Ukrainian armed forces.
08:29.420 - 08:32.200:  And according to Russian media, Andriana is dead.
08:32.660 - 08:39.520:  This Russian television report is just one of hundreds,
08:40.000 - 08:46.020:  accusing Andriana of being a Ukrainian Nazi. Others claim she was killed by Russians,
08:46.060 - 08:52.620:  describing her death in graphic detail. We've traveled to Ukraine and found Andriana.
08:52.920 - 08:58.280:  In a place we can't name for her safety. She is not surprised by the Russian news.
08:58.760 - 09:05.100:  They are professionals in propaganda. Everything that they are touching is about propaganda.
09:05.980 - 09:08.300:  I'm alive and I will protect my country.
09:08.840 - 09:13.460:  Andriana, like many other Ukrainians, joined a volunteer battalion when Russian
09:13.460 - 09:20.500:  invaded Ukraine back in 2014. Although not militarily trains, Andriana showed strong combat skills,
09:20.500 - 09:25.840:  including shooting. When you are on the front line and when you see a target,
09:26.540 - 09:31.900:  how do you feel about it? Is it a target or a person? It depends on a situation,
09:31.900 - 09:39.400:  sometimes it's a person because they are people. But if it will not be for me a target,
09:39.400 - 09:43.580:  I will be a target for them. Andriana poses and looks down.
09:44.300 - 09:47.140:  The tale of her work, evidence on her face.
09:47.640 - 09:54.860:  It's very hard for me to understand that I'm such a person that can see people
09:55.660 - 10:02.680:  when I'm a target. But everything during this nine years is about war.
10:04.240 - 10:08.700:  We're here in the rehab room where Andriana is doing exercises with her hand.
10:09.920 - 10:16.780:  At the moment, she is not able to flex her fingers and her wrist, but she's trying hard.
10:18.600 - 10:25.040:  Andriana sustained multiple injuries when the vehicle she was in drove on the land mine last December.
10:25.940 - 10:31.860:  But for Andriana, it's the impact of war on her family life that is taking the biggest toll.
10:32.340 - 10:35.080:  She hasn't held her son for the seven months.
10:35.900 - 10:39.980:  Two days ago, I was talking with him and he said,
10:39.980 - 10:46.280:  me, that mom remember when we were in family and when we loved each other.
10:46.700 - 10:52.500:  And I tried to explain him that we now are family and we love each other.
10:53.040 - 10:56.000:  But the period is such.
10:56.000 - 11:06.780:  Back in the gym, Andriana's preparing to return to the front line, the prize she's already paid
11:06.780 - 11:08.720:  is too high to give up.
11:09.320 - 11:13.360:  Russians took my best life, best years of life.
11:13.940 - 11:16.300:  They took the childhood of my baby.
11:16.720 - 11:19.820:  We are losing our best people.
11:20.040 - 11:22.720:  They are losing not best Russians.
11:23.560 - 11:25.200:  That's why they are target now.
11:26.120 - 11:36.320:  If I see Ukrainian flag in Crimea, in Donetsk, in Lohansk, then maybe I will try to think about them
11:36.600 - 11:39.520:  like people, but not a target.
11:40.860 - 11:45.000:  Ukraine and soldier Andriana ending that report by Olga Malchewska.
11:46.300 - 11:51.880:  Thousands of women in Africa will die in pregnancy and childbirth as a result of cuts to the UK's
11:51.880 - 11:57.140:  overseas aid budget. That's a stark warning in a report by officials at Britain's foreign
11:57.140 - 12:03.160:  office, which also says hundreds of thousands more women and children will also be put at risk.
12:03.700 - 12:09.200:  The analysis shows that just under five billion dollars is being diverted to provide housing
12:09.200 - 12:14.540:  for refugees in Britain, leaving less money for health programs in many countries.
12:15.120 - 12:17.340:  Here's our diplomatic correspondent, James Landel.
12:18.540 - 12:24.060:  At the moment, about a quarter of the foreign aid budget is being spent housing refugees in Britain.
12:24.060 - 12:28.080:  That means there's a lot less for the government's priorities overseas.
12:28.140 - 12:32.760:  The foreign office paper sets out some of the one and a half billion pounds of savings
12:32.760 - 12:38.040:  it's had to find this year. A 76% cut in aid to Afghanistan, it says,
12:38.040 - 12:42.800:  will leave some of the world's most vulnerable women and girls without critical services.
12:43.400 - 12:49.160:  Cuts to sexual health programs mean thousands more women in Africa will die in childbirth.
12:49.160 - 12:56.140:  A further 200,000 will have unsafe abortions. And in Yemen, half a million women and children
12:56.140 - 13:01.040:  will not receive health care. We know all this because the development minister Andrew Mitchell
13:01.040 - 13:06.720:  wants to be more transparent. He's also found another 160 million pounds to soften the blow.
13:07.400 - 13:12.360:  But aid charities and the International Development Committee said the cuts would have a terrible
13:12.460 - 13:17.200:  impact. James Landel, you've probably heard this song.
13:25.500 - 13:31.260:  That's juice by Lizzo. In the past few years, a singer has taken the music industry by storm.
13:31.260 - 13:37.360:  She's had multiple chart-topping hits and won four Grammys. Many of her songs celebrate her
13:37.360 - 13:43.240:  curvy figure and she's become known for promoting body positivity. She's repeatedly spoken out
13:43.240 - 13:48.340:  against bullying. So it's come as somewhat of a surprise then that three of Lizzo's
13:48.340 - 13:54.100:  format dancers have filed a lawsuit accusing her of sexual and racial harassment,
13:54.100 - 14:00.140:  disability discrimination, false imprisonment and creating a hostile work environment.
14:00.880 - 14:05.280:  Tom Murray is a senior culture reporter for the independent and he told my colleague
14:05.280 - 14:12.660:  Nuala McGovern about the accusations. We have three of Lizzo's former backing dancers who have
14:12.660 - 14:20.720:  filed this long 44-page lawsuit against Lizzo, a dance captain and against her touring company.
14:20.820 - 14:25.500:  So among those accusations, Lizzo herself has been accused of sexual harassment and fostering
14:25.500 - 14:32.180:  a hostile work environment. And there are nine complaints in total which comprise the other two
14:32.180 - 14:39.580:  defendants, the dance captain and the touring company. And among those complaints and in that
14:39.580 - 14:46.120:  kind of long documents are a number of pretty kind of alarming anecdotes. For example,
14:46.520 - 14:51.760:  so I think the one that stood out to me with the most was a story about a trip to an Amsterdam
14:51.760 - 14:58.720:  strip club earlier this year. The lawsuit ledges that Lizzo kind of hounded her employees to engage
14:58.720 - 15:03.460:  with these new performers against their wishes. There's some pretty shocking stuff in that.
15:03.680 - 15:08.120:  So the three people that have brought this lawsuit, who are they exactly?
15:08.440 - 15:13.940:  They're former dancers who have performed with Lizzo at her various live concerts around the world.
15:14.240 - 15:20.660:  And two of them were actually discovered on Lizzo's reality show and another of them was hired
15:20.660 - 15:25.420:  after performing in one of Lizzo's music videos. Because her reality show was all about
15:25.420 - 15:30.880:  bringing on board new dancers. It's watch out for the big girls and very much
15:31.680 - 15:38.680:  and Lizzo has advocated for body positivity, particularly for black women. How significant do you
15:38.680 - 15:43.860:  think this lawsuit is? Well, I think that's why it's been so shocking for the people reacting to it
15:43.860 - 15:50.120:  today is that Lizzo has built up this kind of big reputation as someone who's very empowering,
15:50.120 - 15:56.020:  someone who provides body positivity, who is very pro women's rights, pro LGBT rights,
15:56.020 - 16:01.400:  anti-bullying and these accusations just kind of fly in the face of that. No, we've not heard from
16:01.400 - 16:07.020:  her yet, of course, and that is kind of the next big thing. It will be to see how she responds to this.
16:07.140 - 16:11.960:  And these are accusations. These are allegations. I want to very much underline that and there is no
16:11.960 - 16:19.860:  evidence of guilt yet. And with that, Tom, if in fact there is no evidence of guilt,
16:19.860 - 16:25.120:  if they go forward, does that still damage her brand? It's something she's worked so hard on,
16:25.120 - 16:30.720:  particularly over the past few years. Her star is high and some would say she's on top of her game.
16:31.020 - 16:35.660:  Yeah, I think it would be hard not to. It's one of those stories that the men that's very prevalent
16:35.660 - 16:40.780:  in Hollywood about how these accusations can damage star reputations. And when you have
16:40.780 - 16:45.460:  three plaintiffs like this who have worked with a former for a significant amount of time
16:45.460 - 16:52.060:  bringing forward multiple allegations in quite a long lawsuit, then it's quite difficult for the
16:52.060 - 16:57.760:  fans to kind of measure that against the performer that they know. And certainly I've seen on social media
16:58.400 - 17:02.620:  already a couple of other people who have worked with Lizzo in the past have come forward
17:02.900 - 17:07.840:  applauding these three plaintiffs for their bravery in coming forward their allegations and saying
17:07.840 - 17:13.400:  that they had similar experiences with Lizzo. She has millions of followers online. She's very
17:13.400 - 17:20.520:  much a social media star. Is there any way to gauge the reaction? The majority of people reacting
17:20.520 - 17:26.740:  to this are just kind of shocked that all the performers of all the singers of all the celebrities
17:26.740 - 17:31.400:  out there, you know, while Lizzo. And I think people have really gutted about that because she was
17:31.400 - 17:38.000:  seen in such positive light and was such a kind of bastion for really important messages like
17:38.000 - 17:45.760:  body positivity and among the claims is that she has fact-shamed one of her performers and I think
17:45.760 - 17:51.600:  for the fans of her that will be really gutting to see that she is alleged to have been hypocritical
17:51.600 - 18:01.600:  in this manner. The independence culture reporter Tom Murray. Still to come in the podcast re-united.
18:02.080 - 18:06.000:  I see you have not talked her sense of humour center in the brain at all.
18:06.000 - 18:08.020:  Left that in. It works perfectly well.
18:08.360 - 18:10.060:  Yeah, but I'm German. I never have any.
18:11.400 - 18:14.660:  A remarkable story of music meeting medicine.
18:21.120 - 18:24.860:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The Prime Minister of Singapore,
18:24.860 - 18:30.340:  Lee Sien-Lung, is attempting to settle a corruption scandal involving his government's transport
18:30.380 - 18:36.060:  minister, which on the surface is nothing out of the ordinary. But there's a unique problem.
18:36.060 - 18:41.820:  The Prime Minister has indicated that there are no rules on how to deal with such misconduct
18:41.820 - 18:48.760:  because he says it's so rare. Asia-Pacific editor Michael Bristo told us more about the case.
18:49.760 - 18:54.580:  This is a case involving, as you said there, the transport minister's sub-ramonian Ishwaran.
18:54.720 - 18:59.500:  He was last month arrested by the corruption investigators in Singapore,
18:59.500 - 19:05.940:  suspended from his post, and that investigation is taking place. Today, what happened is the
19:05.940 - 19:11.000:  Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Sien-Lung, went to Parliament and gave an update on the case.
19:11.340 - 19:15.500:  Very little about the details because he didn't want to prejudice that investigation. But
19:15.980 - 19:19.940:  as you indicated there in the introduction, he did say something quite extraordinary in that
19:20.480 - 19:25.920:  simply these cases hardly ever happen in Singapore, and so there's no protocols we've
19:26.240 - 19:31.540:  dealing with them, and this is what he had to say. Such incidents involving ministers are rare,
19:32.200 - 19:37.380:  and there's no rule or precedent on how to effect an interdiction on a political office holder.
19:38.400 - 19:41.980:  Hence, I used the current civil service practice as a reference point.
19:42.680 - 19:48.500:  The specific details in Minister Ishwaran's case follow generally how the civil service
19:48.500 - 19:52.380:  would deal with a senior officer in a similar situation.
19:53.180 - 19:58.020:  So there we heard he had to use rules from another set of protocols in order to deal with this case.
19:58.560 - 20:04.260:  What the Prime Minister did tell us is that it actually reduced the pay of the ministering question,
20:04.260 - 20:10.400:  slash it by about 80% to just over $6,000 US. So still quite a considerable amount of money,
20:10.400 - 20:12.500:  but that's another detail he gave us.
20:12.720 - 20:17.120:  The slash pay is still quite considerable amount of money because government ministers are among
20:17.120 - 20:22.620:  the highest paid in the world in Singapore because this is an argument for combating corruption.
20:22.620 - 20:23.620:  What's gone wrong here?
20:23.920 - 20:26.400:  Yeah, this is another fascinating aspect of this case.
20:26.400 - 20:31.840:  Is that suddenly we realize or we're told once again that Singapore ministers get paid so much
20:31.840 - 20:38.700:  money. If you look at what they do get paid, they get an extraordinary $800,000 a year,
20:38.700 - 20:43.180:  and that's just a benchmark figure, a standard figure. Just to give you a comparison,
20:43.180 - 20:47.860:  I just had a look up at the US president, how much he gets, and that's half the amount,
20:47.860 - 20:54.400:  $400,000. So the reason they do this, Singapore pays so much money, he's in order to
20:54.820 - 21:00.040:  try and deter ministers from getting the involving corruption, which is why this case is so extraordinary,
21:00.040 - 21:03.780:  but as you say there, we can see an extraordinary amount of money.
21:04.900 - 21:09.600:  Michael Bristo, Canada is facing its worst wildfire season on record.
21:09.600 - 21:13.020:  Climate change has led to a sharp increase in such fires.
21:13.540 - 21:18.820:  This year they've burned 12 million hectares of land. Just to put that into context,
21:18.940 - 21:24.160:  that's an area larger than the size of a country such as Cuba or South Korea.
21:24.920 - 21:29.820:  Right now, nearly 1,000 fires are raging across Canada and about a third of them are in the
21:29.820 - 21:36.220:  western province of British Columbia. One fire crept up to the edge of the town of Osuyu,
21:36.220 - 21:41.740:  near the US border. The wind eventually changed directions so some residents are now returning
21:41.740 - 21:46.820:  from evacuation centers. I was actually more relieved that I finally got to go home and I didn't
21:46.820 - 21:51.660:  say in a trailer anymore. I lived in my house for 12, 13 years now, never at one side of wildfire
21:51.660 - 21:57.900:  over here. It's definitely a very new and scary for us. Our reporter, Nitorthic, is in the city of
21:57.900 - 22:05.740:  Kalowna in British Columbia. The Eagle Bluff Wildfire is still raging extremely close to the edge
22:05.740 - 22:12.460:  of the town of Osuyu. Now, things have eased considerably since Saturday when that initial scare,
22:12.460 - 22:17.420:  when the blaze came through from the United States and spread incredibly quickly. But nevertheless,
22:17.420 - 22:24.020:  authorities are still classifying this fire as out of control. They've had water bomber planes,
22:24.020 - 22:30.520:  helicopters in the sky going back and forth all day to the lake of Osuyu. To try to bring this
22:30.980 - 22:38.140:  under control, they've also had over 50 firefighters fighting the blazes. But still, this is opposing
22:38.620 - 22:45.980:  a threat here. They say officials that it is still something that is evolving, a situation that
22:45.980 - 22:52.280:  is evolving. They're keeping a very close eye on the wind direction here, on the dry, hot
22:52.280 - 22:59.900:  temperatures, seeing how that could affect the course of this fire. Now, Canada has had a record
22:59.900 - 23:07.160:  year of wildfires, with more than 30 million acres of land burnt so far. This, of course,
23:07.160 - 23:12.940:  is extremely concerning here because of its proximity to the town. There are dozens of properties
23:12.940 - 23:18.240:  still under evacuation orders and hundreds of others have been told to be ready to evacuate
23:18.240 - 23:24.180:  immediately if they need to. A residence described on Saturday how they were told with very little
23:24.180 - 23:29.700:  notice that they didn't have time to pack, that they had to get out of town. And so that is
23:29.700 - 23:36.620:  really the concern here about what this fire will do in the coming days. It is still very much
23:37.480 - 23:42.660:  early portion of this. It's only been a few days in, but for people here, they say it's already
23:42.660 - 23:50.540:  felt like weeks. Neutrophic in British Columbia in Canada. In Germany, it's not just eggs that
23:50.540 - 23:55.380:  some rucks have been hatching. They've also come up with a cunning plan that ensures they're
23:55.380 - 24:01.000:  well-fed, but which is costing German farmers thousands of euros or dollars. With more details,
24:01.000 - 24:07.920:  here's Harry Bly. Farmers across Germany have reported problems with birds destroying their produce.
24:08.560 - 24:14.020:  In the state of Baden-Württemberg, it's mostly corn being eaten. In Rhineland, Pilatenet,
24:14.400 - 24:18.820:  farmers are losing fruits like cherries and strawberries. The culprit.
24:22.000 - 24:28.500:  Rooks. Large black-fethered birds with a wingspan of up to a meter that live in large flocks,
24:28.880 - 24:34.780:  known collectively as a parliament. And in the state of Bavaria, it's believed the birds have
24:34.780 - 24:41.220:  developed their own method of getting grain from the crop. According to the Bavarian farmers federation,
24:41.220 - 24:47.080:  these rucks have been observed walking into fields, pushing over the stalks of cereal crops,
24:47.080 - 24:53.900:  and then comfortably eating the grains from the ground. And this ability isn't surprising. Rooks
24:53.900 - 25:00.000:  are part of the Corvid Bird family alongside crows, ravens and magpies, and these birds have
25:00.000 - 25:07.040:  been studied for their intelligence. Research in the UK in 2009 saw how rucks, when provided with
25:07.040 - 25:12.480:  the choice of tools, could solve puzzles like releasing trap doors to receive a little snack.
25:13.200 - 25:19.020:  In Bavaria, the Rook population has increased fivefold in the past 15 years, up to an estimated
25:19.020 - 25:26.620:  16,000. For farmers, there's not a simple solution to scare away these invaders. Rooks aren't
25:26.620 - 25:33.000:  phased by scarecrows. Some farmers have used trained falcons to scare them away, but many others
25:33.000 - 25:38.440:  want a more drastic fix. They're calling on the government to lift Germany's ban on hunting
25:38.440 - 25:45.040:  rucks, which are currently a protected species. In the meantime, one Bavarian farmer has hired a
25:45.040 - 25:50.540:  pensioner to drive around his cornfield every hour to scare off any feathery thieves.
25:51.660 - 25:58.260:  Harry Blyh, a woman who played the violin during her brain surgery, has been reunited with
25:58.260 - 26:04.420:  the surgeon who removed her tumour. Dagmar Turner's operation in 2020 was planned in that way,
26:04.420 - 26:09.960:  in the hope it might prevent her musical ability being impaired as a result of the surgery.
26:10.660 - 26:16.780:  She said she was eternally grateful to Professor Q. Mars Ashkan. The pair have been speaking
26:16.780 - 26:27.800:  to our reporter, Wendy Hurrell. It was a musician's need to play violin after
26:27.800 - 26:33.820:  removal of a brain tumour and a surgeon's understanding of the intrinsic value of music
26:33.820 - 26:42.460:  that led to this moment in medical history. My unconscious was very, very good. He said to me,
26:42.480 - 26:49.860:  Dagmar, we need a plan. Only that plan didn't involve my music. So in the end I said to them,
26:50.860 - 26:56.940:  do you think I should play my violin during operation? I looked at me and said,
26:57.380 - 27:01.540:  wow, we need to discuss this with the professor, but what an interesting idea.
27:02.820 - 27:07.760:  I said yes, we can try that and the rest is pretty much history. Music was so important,
27:07.760 - 27:14.100:  Dagmar's quality of life and everything that she was. She was kind of hesitant to have
27:14.100 - 27:18.220:  this conversation with somebody who potentially was a great surgeon but didn't understand the
27:18.220 - 27:23.200:  musical side. Whereas because of my musical background, Dagmar felt that okay. It did sort of take
27:23.200 - 27:28.600:  off around the world. I mean, that picture. Somebody asked me for violin lesson from South Africa.
27:30.940 - 27:35.820:  And I said to someone, I said, look, what do you expect? I'm a woman. I'm blonde and they just
27:35.820 - 27:40.860:  take most of my brain out. I didn't put it back in. And you expect an answer from me?
27:41.900 - 27:46.960:  The guy just looked at me and said, I'm so sorry. I see you have not talked her sense of humour
27:46.960 - 27:52.680:  in the brain at all. Left that in. It works perfectly well. Yeah, but I'm German. I never had any.
27:55.640 - 28:00.560:  She's originally from Germany and she arrived in the UK and the team I was discovered was born
28:00.560 - 28:05.320:  in Iran, travelled in the UK and some other faith brought us together to deliver this one operation.
28:05.920 - 28:11.740:  And that is interesting, isn't it? Yeah. And that report was by Wendy Harrell.
28:14.540 - 28:18.980:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
28:19.240 - 28:23.560:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email. The address
28:23.560 - 28:30.860:  is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. This edition was mixed by Chris Ablakwa, the producer was
28:30.860 - 28:36.700:  Iona Hampson, the editor, as always, is Karen Norton. I'm Janet Jalil. Until next time, goodbye.
