00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:20.740:  by advertising. That 56 seconds, it took me to swim that gold medal win. I looked for that feeling
00:20.740 - 00:28.300:  for 30 years and I never found it. A podcast about the people behind the medals.
00:29.120 - 00:34.360:  On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:36.720 - 00:40.000:  This is the Global News Podcasts from the BBC World Service.
00:41.720 - 00:47.120:  I'm Gareth Barlow, and in the early hours of Monday, the 28th of August, these are our main stories.
00:47.880 - 00:52.260:  Russian officials say genetic tests have confirmed that the Wagner-Mercery Boss,
00:52.260 - 00:57.760:  Yvgeny Pregozion, was killed in a plane crash earlier this week. There are indications that
00:57.760 - 01:03.100:  Ukrainian forces have broken through key Russian defensive positions in the south of the country.
01:03.840 - 01:08.700:  And the main opposition leader in Zimbabwe has accused Emerson and McGaguer of carrying out a coup
01:09.160 - 01:12.800:  after official results show the President won Wednesday's election.
01:14.860 - 01:19.680:  Also in the podcast. It was a small protest because Halshdat is a small
01:19.760 - 01:27.320:  place and these were locals, but for a long time now, they have felt that there is simply too much
01:27.320 - 01:32.720:  tourism in Halshdat. Residents of an Alpine town in Austria, known as one of the most
01:32.720 - 01:37.380:  Instagram places in the world, are fighting back against mass tourism.
01:41.620 - 01:45.700:  It's been confirmed that Yvgeny Pregozion, the chief of the Wagner-Mercery group,
01:45.700 - 01:51.120:  died when his plane crashed on Wednesday. On Sunday, Russian investigators said they'd
01:51.120 - 01:56.640:  identified all the victims. The plane, a private jet, crashed northwest of Moscow on the 23rd
01:56.640 - 02:01.000:  of August, killing all those on board. It's still not known why the plane came down.
02:01.600 - 02:03.520:  Our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg reports.
02:04.460 - 02:10.580:  The statement was brief. Just three sentences. It didn't even mention the Wagner chief by name,
02:10.580 - 02:16.780:  but the implication was clear. Here were the Russian authorities apparently confirming the death
02:16.780 - 02:24.520:  of Yvgeny Pregozion. A spokesperson for Russia's investigative committee announced
02:24.520 - 02:29.100:  that genetic testing of bodies recovered from the crash site had been completed,
02:29.920 - 02:34.940:  and that the identities of all 10 victims matched the names on the flight manifest.
02:34.940 - 02:41.260:  That list of passengers and crew included Mr. Pregozion and his right hand man,
02:41.260 - 02:46.020:  Wagner Commander Dmitry Utkin, the private jet on which they'd been traveling,
02:46.020 - 02:52.020:  had crashed into a field 60 miles north of Moscow on Wednesday. The cause of the crash
02:52.020 - 02:58.320:  is still unclear. There's been much speculation about a bomb, a missile, some kind of sabotage.
02:58.700 - 03:04.220:  The Kremlin has denied having anything to do with it, but that denial has not removed the
03:04.220 - 03:10.380:  suspicion that Mr. Pregozion was targeted by the Russian authorities as an active revenge
03:10.380 - 03:15.720:  for the mutiny he'd organised in June. The insurrection by Wagner fighters,
03:16.280 - 03:20.220:  an unprecedented challenge to the authority of President Putin.
03:21.240 - 03:26.880:  Yvgeny Pregozion led a life parents-with-incident and controversy, with more his Danny Eberhard.
03:27.700 - 03:32.400:  Yvgeny Pregozion's rise to prominence reads like a novel. In Soviet times,
03:32.400 - 03:37.160:  a young Pregozion served a lengthy jail term for assault and robbery. On his release,
03:37.160 - 03:41.600:  he sold hot dogs before setting up restaurants and making contacts with another
03:41.600 - 03:47.720:  St. Petersburg native, Vladimir Putin. He built a fortune on lucrative state catering contracts,
03:47.720 - 03:53.240:  gaining the nickname Putin-Chef. But it was as the head of the Wagner paramilitary group he'll
03:53.240 - 03:59.500:  be remembered. He co-founded it in 2014 during Russia's partly proxy military intervention in
03:59.500 - 04:05.440:  eastern Ukraine. The group expanded operations to Syria and Africa, picking up a reputation for
04:05.440 - 04:09.700:  propping up authoritarian regimes and carrying out grave human rights abuses.
04:10.580 - 04:15.100:  Since last year, Wagner's fought in some of the bloodiest battles in Ukraine, including
04:15.100 - 04:20.280:  Bukhmut. Disillusioned, Pregozion bitterly denounced Russia's military establishment.
04:20.380 - 04:26.160:  The dispute spiraled into a full-scale mutiny. President Putin called it treasonous.
04:26.660 - 04:32.220:  Two months on, a man who had no qualms in bracing brutality has met his own violent end.
04:32.220 - 04:37.840:  Many suspect it's the Kremlin's revenge. That was Danny Eberhardt. Meanwhile,
04:37.840 - 04:43.160:  reports from Southern Ukraine suggests the country's armed forces have broken through some of
04:43.160 - 04:48.520:  Russia's key defensive positions. Antiplematic correspondent Paul Adams is monitoring developments
04:48.520 - 04:54.520:  from Kiev. Ukraine's offensive in the South has been slow-going, but after three months of tough
04:54.520 - 04:59.980:  fighting, southeast of Zaporizia, some Ukrainian units do finally appear to have broken through
04:59.980 - 05:05.140:  Russia's formidable first line of defense. As usual, the government here in Kiev is saying
05:05.140 - 05:09.820:  very little about how its forces are getting on, but this could mark a significant moment.
05:10.360 - 05:15.540:  Russia's defenses have so far been well-organized, but Moscow's forces have been under enormous
05:15.540 - 05:21.540:  pressure for months now. It's not known how strong their remaining defensive lines are or how
05:21.540 - 05:26.360:  they'll respond to the latest developments. Let's head north now to the Baltics, and the leader
05:26.360 - 05:32.120:  once called Europe's new iron lady, but the Prime Minister of Estonia is currently having her
05:32.120 - 05:38.420:  tough credentials sorely tested. Kykallis has taken a particularly tough line when it comes to Russia,
05:38.420 - 05:44.020:  just over the border. She's a strided backer of Ukraine and a staunch critic of Moscow's invasion.
05:44.720 - 05:49.200:  Indeed, she told Estonian businesses they ought to withdraw from Russia, and that's now what's
05:49.200 - 05:55.440:  got her into trouble. I asked our Europe regional editor, Paul Moss, why exactly Kykallis is in the
05:55.440 - 06:02.300:  Philippines? Because it turns out that her husband had 25% shares in a company involved in logistics,
06:03.040 - 06:08.240:  and that company was sending supplies to an aerosol company inside Russia. Now we're not talking
06:08.240 - 06:12.980:  huge money, but the company said to have earned the equivalent of nearly one and a half million
06:12.980 - 06:19.440:  dollars since Russia invaded, and that is seriously embarrassing. Last year, Kykallis said that the
06:19.440 - 06:24.600:  state railway company in Estonia shouldn't carry nickel to Russia. Now, nickels are not subject to
06:24.600 - 06:29.520:  sanctions. Her point was that it was wrong to do anything that helped keep Russia's economy going,
06:29.520 - 06:35.640:  and that obviously leaves her open to her accusations of serious hypocrisy. She says she didn't know
06:35.640 - 06:40.140:  about these investments. She says he and she and her husband just don't discuss business at home.
06:40.140 - 06:44.560:  Now, on the one hand, that's understandable. I guess if he spent his day disguising, you know,
06:44.560 - 06:48.600:  trying to work out which kind of widget to put the company's money in, it might not really come
06:48.600 - 06:53.960:  up around the dinner table. If your wife is the prime minister of Estonia, she's been criticising
06:53.960 - 06:58.160:  anyone doing business with Russia, and you've got shares in a company that's doing that,
06:58.800 - 07:02.600:  you know what people are saying? That might just come up somewhere between dessert and sitting
07:02.600 - 07:07.000:  down to watch the television for the evening. This is serious trouble for her. You would think so
07:07.000 - 07:10.980:  to some degree, surely, and on that basis thing, you mentioned serious trouble. What has the
07:10.980 - 07:16.580:  reaction been? It has been very angry. Political opponents are circling. They're talking about having
07:16.580 - 07:21.260:  a motion of no confidence tabled in the Estonian Parliament this week. The media are hostile.
07:21.340 - 07:26.960:  Lots of newspapers calling for her to go. And perhaps worse, there are surveys which suggest
07:26.960 - 07:32.620:  the majority of Estonians want her to resign. You've got to understand this is a very small country
07:32.620 - 07:38.180:  right next to Russia. This huge neighbour, in fact, Estonia was once absorbed into Russia as part
07:38.180 - 07:44.680:  of the Soviet Union. Anything to do with Russia is very, very sensitive. Basically, if you're an
07:44.680 - 07:50.020:  Estonian politician, you would probably be better off being discovered to have stolen money from
07:50.020 - 07:54.660:  an orphanage or perhaps having an affair with the finance minister's husband. Any of that
07:54.660 - 08:00.180:  will be better than something which involves Russian money. The thoughts there of Paul Moss.
08:00.180 - 08:04.940:  Well, the BBC's Tim Frank spoke to her leading critic of the Estonian Prime Minister.
08:04.940 - 08:09.880:  He's Erma's reign salute, a former minister of foreign affairs and chairman of the Centre
08:09.880 - 08:17.000:  Right Opposition. This is a question of moral, of personal integrity of Prime Minister.
08:17.740 - 08:24.120:  And in that context, media, opposition have called and I fully believe that Prime Minister
08:24.120 - 08:32.080:  has out of moral capacity in this domain to continue this policy of advocating harsh
08:32.080 - 08:39.120:  sanctions and to continue in her office. But I wonder if one of the key parts of what you've
08:39.120 - 08:43.400:  just said is the fact that it's the Prime Minister's husband. It's not the Prime Minister herself,
08:43.400 - 08:50.140:  it's not her company. I mean, why should she be responsible for what her husband gets up to
08:50.140 - 08:55.340:  and also from what I understand? He and his company that he's been involved in this logistics
08:55.340 - 09:02.340:  operation, they haven't broken any laws. Yes, but this is the key issue. Estonian demand is that
09:02.340 - 09:08.980:  there is also a moral approach to companies, to countries that we should ban all the trade
09:08.980 - 09:15.940:  towards Russia. And Prime Minister herself has put it in public messages where it
09:15.940 - 09:22.340:  clear and steadfast. When it became public, Prime Minister's comment on this particular
09:22.340 - 09:30.720:  business of her husband, unfortunately, has been a supportive one. During all these 500 days of war,
09:30.740 - 09:37.600:  there has been a systematic logistics to transport the raw materials into Russia to deliver this
09:37.840 - 09:43.800:  company. And unfortunately, this company still goes on and the cargo delivery is continued.
09:44.440 - 09:50.020:  Hermas Reinsselu, a former minister of foreign affairs in Estonia. Well, on Friday, the husband
09:50.020 - 09:54.660:  of the Estonian Prime Minister, apologised for the situation that's arisen and the, quote,
09:54.660 - 09:59.900:  harm caused to my wife. Other Alex said he would immediately sell his shares in the stark logistics
09:59.900 - 10:06.380:  company and withdraw from it. Let's take you to Zimbabwe now. And Emerson Amangagua is
10:06.380 - 10:11.720:  beginning another five-year term as the country's president, which international observers and the
10:11.720 - 10:17.080:  opposition say was secured by intimidating voters and widespread electoral fraud.
10:17.580 - 10:22.640:  President Amangagua, one with almost 56% of the vote, a result of the opposition leader Nelson
10:22.640 - 10:29.660:  Chamesa, described as blatant and gigantic fraud. Unsurprisingly, the ruling Zanu P.F. party rejected
10:29.660 - 10:35.500:  the criticism, saying the vote was fair and peaceful. Ziyambi Ziyambi is in Barbue's Minister of Justice.
10:36.400 - 10:43.600:  In the history of this country, this is one election that was extremely peaceful and our processes,
10:43.600 - 10:49.860:  the way they were done, they were very fair. Nobody was intimidated. Everyone was afforded
10:50.180 - 10:57.340:  the same opportunities to do whatever they wanted to do. And I'm not very sure which areas the
10:57.340 - 11:04.060:  allegations are coming from to say that they were not fair. Well, even before the results were
11:04.060 - 11:09.160:  announced, several independent foreign observers criticized the fairness and credibility of the
11:09.160 - 11:14.300:  elections. Observer missions from the EU, Commonwealth and Sexting Nation, Southern African
11:14.300 - 11:18.940:  Development Community reported a number of concerns with the vote, including the banning of
11:18.940 - 11:24.060:  opposition rallies. Among the critics is the Zimbabwean journalist and documentary maker Hoko
11:24.060 - 11:30.780:  Chenane. In urban areas which are mainly opposition strongholds, they didn't have election material
11:30.780 - 11:37.560:  that is ballot papers for over 12 hours. And this was a form of rigging cold voter suppression.
11:38.060 - 11:44.440:  Prior to the election day itself, the opposition was not allowed to hold all its rallies.
11:44.440 - 11:50.040:  They have to get permission from the police. So everything was taken against the opposition.
11:51.300 - 11:55.360:  While the ruling Zani-Pf party was also declared the winner in the parliamentary race,
11:55.640 - 12:01.520:  but failed to secure a two-thirds majority to allow the party to institute constitutional amendments,
12:02.140 - 12:05.820:  which observers had feared could be used to extend presidential term limits.
12:06.600 - 12:10.760:  So what now then for the main opposition party's citizens coalition for change? What are their
12:10.760 - 12:17.320:  options? A question for our correspondent in Harari Shingai-Nioka. Nelson Chamisa, the opposition leader
12:17.320 - 12:23.760:  held a press conference. He kept the cards very close to his chest, but really reasserted the
12:23.760 - 12:29.780:  position that he believes that he won this presidential election. Officially, he pulled 44 percent
12:29.780 - 12:36.780:  of the votes, and Emerson Menangua got 52.6. But he really wasn't clear about what he was going
12:36.780 - 12:41.040:  to do next. I specifically asked him whether he was going to take the matter to court,
12:41.700 - 12:46.580:  and he didn't respond. That's because in the past when he has taken these matters to court,
12:46.580 - 12:52.040:  he tried to get the 2018 results overturned in the constitutional court, and he failed.
12:52.600 - 12:57.520:  So he really is running out of options. There has been talk about protests, but we really
12:57.520 - 13:01.620:  haven't seen that on the ground, that level of anger that would lead to protests.
13:01.980 - 13:08.080:  It strikes me that Zani-Nioka needs a smooth electoral process, because the country still faces
13:08.080 - 13:14.340:  huge economic challenges. It's shunned by wide parts of the international community too. It doesn't
13:14.340 - 13:19.540:  need these kinds of distractions. And that is the concern that was expressed by Nelson
13:19.540 - 13:25.780:  Tamisa is that for so many decades, for almost as many decades as I've worked as a journalist
13:25.780 - 13:32.220:  in this country, every election has been disputed. It's been violent. And there's a link that people
13:32.220 - 13:38.880:  make here between the Zimbabwe's politics and the state of its economy. It has been shunned by
13:38.880 - 13:44.760:  Western countries. Investors have fled. They also under under former president Robert Mugabe
13:44.760 - 13:50.560:  where the policies were so inconsistent and they would change. Investors really didn't want to
13:50.560 - 13:57.560:  come back. And so really this election was to have been the first sign of confidence to investors
13:57.560 - 14:02.960:  that Zimbabwe is really ready to fix its politics, to adhere to human rights as well as to the rule
14:02.960 - 14:08.860:  of law. But that hasn't happened. The Commonwealth, for example, Zimbabwe had applied to be a
14:08.860 - 14:14.080:  re-admitted to the Commonwealth. And one of the conditions was a free and fair election. So given
14:14.080 - 14:18.720:  the damning assessment that the Commonwealth gave of these elections, it's not clear whether that
14:18.720 - 14:24.880:  will happen. And so it seems that Zimbabwe is just stuck in this endless crisis of politics and
14:24.880 - 14:32.620:  bad politics and bad economics. The voice there is shinganyaka. Since it was launched in 2016,
14:32.620 - 14:39.620:  use of the video-sharing platform TikTok has grown exponentially. For a billion users every month,
14:39.620 - 14:44.120:  those are the company's figures. It's a major source of both entertainment and information.
14:44.740 - 14:49.020:  This year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland, young TikTok stars have been trying to
14:49.020 - 14:54.160:  translate their online fame into performing comedy live on stage, Vincent Doudreports.
14:55.760 - 15:01.420:  Here in Edinburgh, there are well over 3,000 shows and comedy dominates, such as Knock Knock,
15:01.420 - 15:08.560:  whose young cast will mean nothing to you unless you're an online devotee of TikTok, in which case
15:08.560 - 15:15.240:  they are massive. Guys, I'm not a wedding right, and I want to get married. I'm going to propose.
15:15.700 - 15:19.960:  Someone stole my men's speech when it fell at my bag on this little walk back from the court,
15:19.960 - 15:25.460:  which is only 200 metres away. Oh, Molly and Zach voted for Mitch and LR. Mitch winked at him.
15:25.720 - 15:32.540:  We will be learning about World War II, Ashley, for the rest of your school careers, actually.
15:34.600 - 15:40.300:  Comedy Burnout can hit on the Edinburgh Fringe, but this audience was thrilled to see four
15:50.920 - 15:52.860:  TikTok favourites in the flesh. Like his colleagues, Stephen MacKell,
15:52.860 - 16:00.160:  Ayame Ponder and Coco Surrell, in his mid-twenties, Henry Rowley has an impressive online following.
16:00.160 - 16:04.260:  His act sends up his own middle class, Ladishness.
16:05.140 - 16:09.700:  Right, so we're at Fringe, right? We're halfway through, and it's sick, right? Everyone seems to get
16:09.700 - 16:13.880:  really competitive about how niche they can be with the shows that they've seen, right?
16:15.680 - 16:19.640:  Meanwhile, I'm there, strolling out of ladyboys at Bangkok.
16:22.040 - 16:23.040:  Hi, I'm Henry Rowley.
16:23.240 - 16:23.680:  Hey, Ayame.
16:24.000 - 16:25.960:  Hi, I'm Stephen MacKell, and I'm from Faith.
16:26.300 - 16:29.980:  I am Surrell. My online handle is Coco Surrell.
16:30.080 - 16:31.460:  What would I kind of associate you with?
16:31.760 - 16:37.220:  Reaction videos are reacting to anything from bottles smashing on stairs to men and women,
16:37.580 - 16:38.040:  actually, inclusive.
16:38.220 - 16:42.740:  Post stereotypes are the most famous ones, but also uncomfortable things like creepy teachers.
16:43.160 - 16:47.080:  For my love island debriefs, where I just talk about the show love island.
16:47.120 - 16:50.600:  Comedy sketches, more event about Scottish culture and growing up being Scottish.
16:51.040 - 16:55.040:  I think I'd lost the dream about becoming someone. I'd always been an attention seeker.
16:55.300 - 16:58.560:  I was in the state agent, and I'd posted one video that did really well, and I thought,
16:58.780 - 17:01.360:  oh, wow, I can make it out of this dump.
17:01.920 - 17:04.940:  Online is so saturated with so much good content.
17:04.940 - 17:08.860:  You can get lucky when something picks up a wave and takes off, and when you get that,
17:08.860 - 17:10.400:  you get eyes on your other stuff.
17:10.580 - 17:13.440:  Once you get a video that does well, how are you going to do after that?
17:13.460 - 17:16.740:  This is a world which is being invented as we speak. What do you hope to move on to?
17:17.140 - 17:20.860:  Acting, presenting, hosting, comedy, writing.
17:20.860 - 17:27.220:  I'm Edward Linderman. I head up entertainment and news operations at Tiktok here in the UK.
17:27.760 - 17:30.460:  Tiktok is really synonymous with comedy content.
17:30.740 - 17:35.020:  You know, the very early stages of the platform, people would come to Tiktok because
17:35.480 - 17:38.720:  they made them laugh, and I think when Tiktok became really well known,
17:38.720 - 17:43.260:  was during the pandemic, we all really needed some of that light relief and some of that comedy content.
17:43.680 - 17:49.560:  Greta Titelman from Los Angeles has a high energy show, almost next door to the Tiktok stars,
17:50.220 - 17:55.160:  but she's slightly older and she's ambivalent about Tiktok's emerging power
17:55.520 - 17:58.040:  to shape bite-sized comedy content.
17:58.700 - 18:01.340:  I think Tiktok is a really, really, really amazing tool,
18:02.100 - 18:08.500:  and I oscillate between feeling like a big fool for not investing more of my time in it,
18:09.200 - 18:14.320:  but then I also feel an immense freedom in the fact that, well, I don't have, you know,
18:14.320 - 18:19.560:  millions of followers that I constantly need to be feeding their hunger for more content.
18:20.480 - 18:25.680:  I can honestly be intimidated by some content creators on Tiktok,
18:25.680 - 18:32.620:  just in the sheer volume that they can put something out and the fearlessness that they seem to have.
18:33.260 - 18:39.100:  Some Tiktok comedy success stories have already been catching the eye of TV and radio,
18:39.100 - 18:44.740:  even of film companies. Tiktok's critics said the talent it discovered wouldn't last.
18:44.740 - 18:48.280:  Ed Linderman of Tiktok does not agree.
18:48.720 - 18:53.300:  The creators we see succeeding, and probably the two key attributes that they have
18:53.780 - 18:58.920:  is one being creative, and that sounds very obvious, but it's really about coming up with new
18:58.920 - 19:02.380:  and different ideas around whether it's characters or videos themselves.
19:03.020 - 19:07.860:  And then the second one actually is consistency. It's a big commitment, it's a full-time job,
19:07.860 - 19:11.960:  so they're constantly thinking about the next piece of content or video that they're creating,
19:12.440 - 19:16.820:  and that's because they want to really engage the communities that follow them
19:16.820 - 19:19.640:  and provide them with things that make them laugh.
19:20.080 - 19:23.100:  Ed Linderman of Tiktok ending that report by Vincent Down.
19:25.340 - 19:25.860:  Still to come.
19:26.260 - 19:29.640:  We brought this bag with us. Look at the halls. Look at the halls.
19:29.760 - 19:31.340:  It wasn't down for very long.
19:31.740 - 19:35.140:  Here why officials in Rome are having to clean up the Colosseum.
19:41.460 - 19:43.360:  From their battles on the world stage.
19:43.620 - 19:47.680:  I gave everything for that race and I was able to come away with something that I've dreamed
19:47.680 - 19:50.580:  about since I was a kid. To their battles behind closed doors.
19:50.620 - 19:56.640:  I had to reach some terrible bottoms in my addiction and suffer some really terrible consequences
19:56.760 - 20:00.900:  and suffer a lot of loss due to my drinking to get to where I am today.
20:02.040 - 20:06.640:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympians and Paralympians share their stories.
20:06.640 - 20:11.680:  On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
20:12.620 - 20:16.400:  Welcome back to the Global News podcast. Let's take you to Argentina where
20:16.400 - 20:21.420:  officials say there's been a wave of looting over the past week with attacks on shops and
20:21.420 - 20:27.060:  supermarkets in several provinces. A government spokesperson accused the libertarian opposition leader
20:27.060 - 20:32.560:  Javier Mule of stoking the unrest. He's currently the front runner as October's election draws
20:32.560 - 20:38.220:  closer. He's denied the claims. Argentina is in the middle of a severe economic crisis
20:38.740 - 20:43.820:  with inflation running into triple figures, putting many basic goods out of the reach of most people.
20:44.380 - 20:48.700:  James Menendez spoke to Anna Lanqués, Latin American correspondent of the Convicts magazine,
20:48.700 - 20:55.700:  say how bad has the looting been? The looting started last Friday and carried on throughout the week
20:56.260 - 21:01.600:  and so far at least 94 people have been detained just in Buenos Aires province and they were at
21:01.600 - 21:06.300:  least 150 separate incidents of looting in the province of Buenos Aires and dozens more across
21:06.300 - 21:12.580:  the country. And it's really in cities all across the country. Does it seem in any way organized?
21:13.620 - 21:18.700:  So that's what the government is saying. They're saying that several politicians from opposition
21:18.700 - 21:25.060:  parties have stoked the unrest and are encouraging looting on WhatsApp. But so far we have no proof
21:25.060 - 21:32.040:  for any political parties behind this. Rather, it just seems that as fears of uncertainty are mounting
21:32.080 - 21:37.600:  and there are fears that there is hyperinflation coming in the next few months, people are getting
21:37.600 - 21:41.860:  really nervous. And so there are rumors on WhatsApp that because this crisis is coming,
21:41.860 - 21:46.400:  you know, you better stock up soon and looting supermarkets. This has already happened in the past
21:46.400 - 21:51.400:  that happened in 2001 and it happened in 1989 when there were episodes of hyperinflation.
21:52.080 - 21:57.800:  And just give us a bit more detail on how bad the economic crisis has become. What does it like for
21:57.800 - 22:03.200:  most families? It's really terrible. Right now you have inflation running, annual inflation running
22:03.200 - 22:09.680:  at 115%, which is higher than anywhere else in the world except Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Lebanon.
22:10.340 - 22:14.980:  And what that means is that the local currency, the best so, devalues so quickly that you cannot save,
22:14.980 - 22:21.040:  people do not hold money in local bank accounts. So it's become impossible to save. There is a
22:21.040 - 22:27.340:  growing informal economy and people have resorted to bartering. So for example, now you have markets
22:27.340 - 22:34.180:  where you can trade diapers for clothing or, you know, different food stuff. So the fear now is
22:34.180 - 22:39.360:  that things are going to get worse before they get better because in order to fix Argentina's
22:39.360 - 22:44.220:  economy, the government, whoever comes to power in the October elections is going to have to make
22:44.220 - 22:48.660:  some very difficult decisions. And that's the context in which the looting is happening.
22:49.280 - 22:53.920:  And have you made me lay? I mean, he's shaken up the race. Is he also contributing to the
22:54.060 - 22:58.860:  economic uncertainty? Definitely. So as you mentioned, the candidate who got the most votes in
22:58.860 - 23:03.920:  the primary was have you made me lay and he's a libertarian outsider who proposes really radical
23:03.920 - 23:09.640:  changes to Argentina's economy, including scrapping the peso and dollarizing the economy and in
23:09.640 - 23:14.580:  the process, getting rid of the central bank. And the outcome of the primaries added a lot of
23:14.580 - 23:19.760:  uncertainty to what is already a very fragile situation. And so the day after the election,
23:19.760 - 23:25.200:  the central bank devalued the local currency because of that increased uncertainty. And that will
23:25.340 - 23:30.000:  almost certainly lead prices to rise even more in the coming weeks. And then in addition,
23:30.000 - 23:35.860:  this year, Argentina was hit by a terrible drought. And the country owes a huge debt to the IMF
23:35.860 - 23:40.740:  with several payments coming due later this year. So you put all those factors together. And
23:40.740 - 23:47.540:  there's a lot of fear right now. And Alankas of the economist. Ethiopia and Egypt say talks
23:47.540 - 23:53.380:  have resumed in Cairo in an effort to end a lengthy diplomatic route about a huge dam on the
23:53.380 - 23:59.360:  river Nile. Egypt and Sudan have long feared that their water supply will be threatened by Ethiopia's
23:59.360 - 24:05.180:  decision to build the five billion dollar project. Africa Regional Editor Will Ross reports.
24:06.100 - 24:11.080:  Government officials from Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan are in Cairo trying to finally come up with
24:11.080 - 24:16.100:  an agreement on how to share the waters of the river Nile. Construction of the vast dam in
24:16.100 - 24:21.880:  Western Ethiopia began more than a decade ago. It started generating electricity early last year,
24:21.880 - 24:27.440:  and the reservoir is steadily being filled up, much to the anger of Egypt and to a lesser extent
24:27.440 - 24:33.520:  Sudan. Almost all of Egypt's water comes from the river Nile, so it sees the dam as a huge threat.
24:33.520 - 24:39.280:  Ethiopia says the project is essential in order to electrify millions of homes and help eradicate
24:39.280 - 24:44.520:  poverty. That report by Will Ross. Let's take you to France and the wooded rolling hills of
24:44.520 - 24:49.480:  Maymak. These days, the small town is known for ancient houses and network of rivers and views
24:49.480 - 24:54.760:  of the central French countryside. Back in the Second World War, it was the scene of a mass
24:54.760 - 25:00.400:  execution of German prisoners who were forced to dig their own graves and then shot by the French
25:00.400 - 25:06.060:  resistance. Archaeologists have been uncovering the site after it was identified by the last surviving
25:06.060 - 25:13.240:  witness. A France correspondent Hugh Scofield picks up the story. This comes about because the 98-year-old
25:13.240 - 25:19.500:  Ed Moore Ray-Vay has decided that the very end of his life to reveal this extraordinary secret,
25:19.500 - 25:25.540:  which was the killing by the resistance, French resistance of 40-50 that numbers are not
25:25.540 - 25:31.060:  entirely clear, German prisoners just after D-Day. And this was a couple of days, like you say,
25:31.060 - 25:37.460:  after D-Day, in this kind of wooded area, this network of rolling hills and rivers around there,
25:37.460 - 25:41.540:  and these Germans were forced to dig their own graves before they were then shot.
25:41.900 - 25:47.360:  The circumstances are very specific. It was after D-Day. It was at the time of great tension across
25:47.420 - 25:52.780:  France, as German forces pushed up to Normandy. The days immediately preceding this had been
25:52.780 - 25:59.100:  terrible German executions in the area. 99 people hanged publicly in the town of Toul,
25:59.580 - 26:04.700:  where these German prisoners were taken, and then the massacre of even more people at the order
26:04.700 - 26:10.900:  of Surgland, the village was just destroyed. And these Germans were being held prisoner because
26:10.900 - 26:16.100:  there had been a little uprising in the town of Toul, and was had briefly succeeded. And this
26:16.100 - 26:23.140:  group of 40-50-60 German prisoners were marched off into the Maki, into the wooded, sparsely
26:23.140 - 26:29.560:  populated countryside, not quite mountainous, but very, very hilly. And the resistance group had
26:29.560 - 26:33.980:  no idea what to do with them. They were not trained for this, they hadn't planned for this.
26:33.980 - 26:39.040:  The circumstances had suddenly changed. They radioed through to their command for instructions,
26:39.620 - 26:43.460:  and for whatever reason, possibly as a reprisal for what had happened in
26:43.880 - 26:50.460:  Surgland and Toul, the command order came, shoot them. So the group ordered the German soldiers
26:50.460 - 26:56.060:  to dig there, a big trench there in grave, and then they were shot in the chest by the French
26:56.060 - 27:00.560:  resistance, mounted a distance of about four or five meters, and tumbled into the grave. So it's
27:00.560 - 27:06.240:  one of those appalling stories, one here's about from wartime. The oddity is that this time it's
27:06.240 - 27:12.020:  the Inverticon is goodies, who did it? So the archaeologists have found some coins, they found
27:12.020 - 27:18.400:  some bullets, but notably they haven't found any bodies yet. What are the next stages in this
27:18.400 - 27:22.100:  search? We know roughly where it was, and they thought they found the trench, but they hadn't,
27:22.100 - 27:27.640:  because this the bit of ground they dug up didn't reveal the bodies, but in the vicinity of this,
27:27.940 - 27:33.300:  where they hoped to find the bodies, they had sort of probes down, and that was where they found
27:33.300 - 27:39.800:  all these artifacts, 20 or so bullets and bullet casings, coins, all dating from pre-1944,
27:39.800 - 27:46.220:  the bullet casings, and bullets of Swiss, German, American, and French manufacturer,
27:46.240 - 27:52.180:  which would reflect exactly the kind of disparate weaponry that irregular resistance would have had.
27:52.180 - 27:57.120:  So I mean, it's quite clear that this is the place. Our France correspondent there, Hugh
27:57.120 - 28:02.940:  Scofield, you're listening to the Global News podcast. Now to sports and the World Athletics
28:02.940 - 28:07.200:  Championships, taking place in Hungary, have come to a close. Our sports reporter, Alex
28:07.200 - 28:12.980:  Kempstik, is in Budapest. A world championships full of excitement ended with yet more drama.
28:12.980 - 28:17.240:  Mary Mora of Kenya clinched the much-anticipated women's 800 metres,
28:17.840 - 28:21.640:  pipping the two favourites, Britain's Keely Hodgonson and the defending champion,
28:21.640 - 28:27.180:  Athing Moe of the US. Norway's Jakob Inga Brickston made up for missing out on gold in the 1500
28:27.180 - 28:33.620:  metres, with an edge of the seat victory over 5000. In the finale to nine days of gripping action,
28:33.620 - 28:38.200:  Femke Khabal, whose fall on the opening day denied the Netherlands gold in the mix relay,
28:38.640 - 28:44.680:  produced a sensational late surge to drag her team into first place in the fall by 400 metres.
28:45.500 - 28:49.880:  On the infield, there was a popular winner in the women's high jump, Yaroslava Makacik,
28:50.240 - 28:54.980:  with Ukraine's first gold in Budapest, while in the men's javelin, the Olympic champion from
28:54.980 - 29:01.260:  India, near as Chopra, threw furthest with Pakistan's Arshed Nadim in the silver medal position.
29:02.100 - 29:05.000:  In his closing speech, the head of World Athletics Sebastian Ko,
29:05.000 - 29:11.180:  described the championships as outstanding. Few would argue that Budapest has delivered.
29:12.040 - 29:17.380:  Alex Kapstik. In Austria, the residents of an Alpine town, known as one of the most
29:17.380 - 29:23.840:  Instagram places in the world, have held a protest against mass tourism. An estimated 10,000
29:23.840 - 29:30.140:  people visit Alstad, a world heritage site every day during the high season, but just 700 people
29:30.140 - 29:35.440:  live there. Some of the locals have taken part in a sit-in to block the mountain tunnel which
29:35.440 - 29:41.240:  leads to the town. I heard more from the BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna. It was a small protest,
29:41.360 - 29:46.920:  because Alstad is a small place, and these were locals, residents, people who live there,
29:47.580 - 29:54.520:  but for a long time now, they have felt that there is simply too much tourism in Alstad,
29:54.520 - 30:01.580:  that too many people are coming, particularly too many day trippers. Today, a group of people
30:01.580 - 30:09.380:  from Alstad went and blocked the mountain tunnel, which is the main route into Alstad,
30:09.420 - 30:16.440:  for these day trippers, many of whom are brought in big travel buses. They said, really,
30:16.760 - 30:22.080:  there has to be a reduction in the number of daily tourists, and that they want to have buses
30:22.900 - 30:29.080:  not arriving in the place from 5 p.m. until 10 a.m. the next day. And to put some figures on this,
30:29.080 - 30:36.180:  that village has roughly 700 inhabitants, and potentially 10,000 people a day are going during
30:36.180 - 30:42.500:  high season. Why has it become so popular? The first thing that has to be said, it is a very,
30:42.500 - 30:48.840:  very beautiful place. It is a world heritage site. It's got a beautiful little village, which
30:48.940 - 30:55.380:  is perched on the shores of this pristine alpine lake and the craggy mountains all around about.
30:56.200 - 31:05.140:  But it became popular in Asia, and it featured actually in a South Korean romantic drama back in 2006.
31:05.760 - 31:12.640:  And then in 2012, a lot of Chinese were coming to visit it, and some Chinese actually built a
31:12.640 - 31:18.820:  replica of Alstad in China. And then since then, it's just become more and more popular,
31:18.820 - 31:24.300:  particularly because it's got a very, very popular on social media and on Instagram.
31:24.300 - 31:29.280:  At the end of the day, tourism has its benefits, it brings jobs, it brings money, it brings
31:29.280 - 31:33.400:  foreign investment as well, but there is obviously the flip side, the inhabitants say they are
31:33.780 - 31:38.620:  inundated with people. Where does this all go? What is the resolution here, do you think?
31:38.880 - 31:44.860:  Nobody in Halstad would dispute how important tourism has been for its economy. This was a tiny
31:44.860 - 31:51.460:  little village, which has really done very well after tourism. But at the moment, they're saying
31:51.460 - 31:57.100:  really this can't go on, and they make comparisons. People talk about overtourism in places like Venice,
31:57.100 - 32:05.300:  but they say per capita, each resident of Halstad has way more tourists coming than bigger cities
32:05.300 - 32:10.900:  like Venice do, for example. Certainly the town wants to see concepts to try and limit the
32:10.900 - 32:15.840:  tour buses coming through. It was interesting the last time I was in Halstad, I was at the
32:16.360 - 32:21.500:  Instagram selfie point, and there were people having their pictures taken or taking their own
32:21.500 - 32:27.340:  pictures, and you could see a homemade sign that had been put up by the side of the lake saying
32:27.340 - 32:32.860:  quiet please. That was Bethany Pell. Let's stay with tourism because one of the world's biggest
32:32.860 - 32:39.440:  attractions has been forced to clean up its act after being overrun in parts by rodents. Visitors
32:39.440 - 32:44.680:  have been posting videos of rats roaming around the Colosseum in Rome and their numbers are reported
32:44.680 - 32:49.940:  to be on the rise. Stephanie Prentice has this report. Welcome to Roma.
32:53.760 - 32:59.760:  One of many videos on TikTok posted by visitors to the Colosseum showing large rats scurrying
32:59.760 - 33:04.360:  across the ground, running over visitors' feet and getting into their bags.
33:15.720 - 33:20.400:  It's become such an issue that officials launched a special intervention over the weekend,
33:20.400 - 33:26.100:  bringing in extra cleaning staff, laying traps and clearing out the drains that the rats emerge from.
33:26.620 - 33:31.540:  In a statement, the city government said there are an estimated seven million rats in central
33:31.540 - 33:38.820:  Rome or 2.5 for every inhabitant, but it says a surge of visitors this summer, combined with the
33:38.820 - 33:43.440:  heatwave, have created conditions that have drawn the rodents into the Colosseum and surrounding
33:43.440 - 33:50.140:  area, namely lots of leftover food and piles of rubbish. Built two thousand years ago, the
33:50.140 - 33:55.960:  Colosseum was the biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire and attracts around six million visitors
33:55.960 - 34:01.260:  every year. Those visitors are now being encouraged to clean up after themselves as they
34:01.260 - 34:06.520:  tore the ancient ruins and to keep a close eye on their bags if there are any snacks inside.
34:11.040 - 34:14.600:  That's all for now, but there will be a new addition of the Glaibungus podcast later.
