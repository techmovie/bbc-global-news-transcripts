00:36.140 - 00:40.180:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:42.380 - 00:47.220:  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Saturday the 5th of August, these are our main stories.
00:47.820 - 00:52.680:  A court in Russia has sentenced the jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny to a further
00:52.680 - 00:58.480:  lengthy term behind bars in one of the country's toughest prisons. West African states have
00:58.480 - 01:05.200:  agreed a plan for potential military intervention to restore democracy to Niger. A wildfire in the
01:05.200 - 01:13.180:  Iranian capital sets off explosions outside the Evan prison. Also in this podcast at the Edinburgh
01:13.180 - 01:19.800:  Fringe Festival in Scotland, the one woman show with an audience of one. I knew it was pretty
01:19.800 - 01:25.080:  few weeks, I knew it was going to be hard, all just came out afterwards and that's when I had a cry.
01:25.940 - 01:27.960:  Keep listening for a happy ending.
01:31.660 - 01:36.460:  We begin in Russia, where the country's most prominent opposition leader Alexey Navalny,
01:36.460 - 01:42.560:  who's been imprisoned to remote penal colonies since 2021, has been found guilty of extremism
01:42.560 - 01:48.900:  charges and had his prison sentence extended to 19 years. It's understood here and I've been
01:48.900 - 01:54.600:  taken to one of Russia's highest security prisons to be subjected to a special regime likely to
01:54.600 - 02:00.380:  include longer periods of solitary confinement. Friday's court proceedings were held at the prison
02:00.380 - 02:05.260:  in Melikovov from where our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg sent his this report.
02:06.080 - 02:11.040:  For this court case, the phrase behind closed doors feels like an understatement.
02:11.660 - 02:16.760:  Alexey Navalny was tried in the high security prison in which he's currently incarcerated.
02:17.480 - 02:23.400:  The proceedings were closed to the press and the public. But for the verdict, we were allowed in
02:23.700 - 02:25.620:  to penal colony number six.
02:30.320 - 02:35.960:  Journalists crammed into a small room, dubbed the press center, to watch on a video screen.
02:36.620 - 02:41.780:  We weren't allowed into the makeshift courtroom itself, the prison hall, where the Kremlin's most
02:41.780 - 02:48.540:  vocal critic and Russia's most famous prisoner was pronounced guilty, yet again, this time on
02:48.540 - 02:54.540:  extremism charges. Although due to the poor quality and intermittent audio being pumped into the
02:54.540 - 02:59.940:  press room, it wasn't initially clear to journalists here just how long the new prison sentence was.
03:00.560 - 03:06.620:  Alexey Navalny and his supporters insist he is a political prisoner. A charismatic protest leader
03:06.620 - 03:12.560:  and anti-corruption crusader Mr. Navalny fell foul of the Kremlin long ago. In recent years,
03:12.560 - 03:17.560:  he's been the only opposition leader in Russia capable of bringing large numbers of people,
03:18.300 - 03:22.860:  especially young Russians, onto the streets nationwide in anti-government protests.
03:23.680 - 03:29.200:  In 2020, in Siberia, he was poisoned with a nerve agent and airlifted to Germany.
03:30.040 - 03:34.140:  He claims the Kremlin had tried to kill him. The Russian authorities denied.
03:34.940 - 03:40.080:  On his return to Russia in 2021, he was arrested and jailed. Ever since,
03:40.080 - 03:45.060:  it's been trial after trial, prison sentence after prison sentence.
03:45.940 - 03:52.280:  Steve Rosenberg, well in a statement posted on Facebook, Alexey Navalny urged Russians to keep
03:52.280 - 03:58.860:  up the fight. He said, you are being forced to surrender your Russia without a fight to a gang
03:58.860 - 04:04.380:  of traitor's thieves and scoundrels who seize power. Do not lose the will to resist.
04:05.240 - 04:09.660:  As spokesman for the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Volkotuk said the sentence
04:09.660 - 04:16.100:  imposed had been based on weak charges. Mr. Turk noted that the 19-year sentence was based on vague
04:16.100 - 04:21.360:  and overly broad charges of extremism and followed a closed trial on the premises of the prison
04:21.360 - 04:27.400:  where Mr. Navalny is already serving two other sentences, amounting to 11 and a half years.
04:27.740 - 04:32.340:  And he called on Russian authorities to take measures to respect their human rights
04:32.340 - 04:37.620:  obligations by immediately ceasing violations of Mr. Navalny's human rights and releasing him.
04:38.080 - 04:41.820:  And the Secretary General supports the Human Rights High Commissioner on this.
04:42.560 - 04:47.160:  Vladimir Shokov is Executive Director of the Foundation Against Corruption
04:47.600 - 04:54.920:  founded by Mr. Navalny and now based in the UK. And he gave Julian Marshall his reaction to the
04:54.920 - 05:02.060:  sentence. It was expected in today's oppressive environment that Putin has created. Today's
05:02.060 - 05:08.680:  sentence is the next step in persecution of Navalny. His first sentence was given to him actually
05:08.680 - 05:16.260:  10 years ago in the summer of 2013 and then in 2020 it was followed by assassination attempt
05:16.260 - 05:23.520:  and incarceration after he returned to Russia in January 2021 and now this ridiculous sentence.
05:23.860 - 05:29.140:  What do you know about his physical and his mental health because he's in for a tough time,
05:29.140 - 05:34.300:  isn't he? Yes, he is in for a tough time but the last two and a half years were not
05:34.300 - 05:40.280:  walking the park either. He is in harsh conditions of Russian prison and prison authorities
05:40.280 - 05:47.920:  make it a point to make life difficult in prison for Navalny through various means. But nevertheless,
05:47.920 - 05:54.840:  Navalny sends from his prison cell the message of truth, the message of encouragement for
05:54.840 - 06:02.360:  Russians. And in his last words just a few days ago, he was encouraging Russians to do whatever
06:02.360 - 06:10.060:  little they can to confront this war and this dictatorship. In those comments earlier this week,
06:10.060 - 06:16.760:  he said the purpose would be to frighten Russians with this lengthy prison sentence. Will that be
06:16.760 - 06:25.880:  the case? I think Russian authorities do feel the need to frighten people and a regime that
06:25.940 - 06:33.640:  does out such ridiculous sentences. I mean 19 years is more than many murderers get and Navalny gets
06:33.640 - 06:41.360:  it just for words and for being a political force. I don't think such a regime is quite confident
06:41.360 - 06:49.840:  in their legitimacy and in their stability. So indeed, they have a feeling that they need to frighten
06:49.840 - 06:56.720:  people. Do you think though that Mr. Navalny still has the support in Russia that he once had
06:56.720 - 07:04.840:  and particularly at a time of war? Well, it's difficult to put a number on the levels of his support,
07:04.840 - 07:11.060:  you know, in today's environment when people are afraid to talk to pollsters, people get fines
07:11.060 - 07:20.260:  and are arrested often by doing a single person picket with a blank piece of paper. We can judge by
07:20.260 - 07:28.380:  objective factors if we take 2013 the mayoral elections, Navalny despite all the obstacles he got
07:28.380 - 07:37.900:  almost to the run of round against the incumbent mayor with 28% of votes versus 50%. So I think since then
07:37.900 - 07:45.540:  an average Russian would only feel more disillusioned with the regime which have seen the standards
07:45.540 - 07:52.260:  of living, stagnating or deteriorating, familiar international brands live in the country,
07:52.260 - 07:59.980:  international travel restricted and for the last year and a half a constant stream of coffins
08:00.240 - 08:03.600:  coming to Russian homes from the battlefields of Ukraine.
08:04.500 - 08:08.580:  Vladimir Ashukhov, Executive Director of the Foundation Against Corruption,
08:08.580 - 08:15.380:  founded by Alexei Navalny. Well, meanwhile, in the war in Ukraine, a Russian Navy ship has been
08:15.380 - 08:22.100:  towed into harbor after what Kyiv says was a strike by one of its sea drones. The vessel, a large
08:22.100 - 08:27.480:  landing ship capable of carrying battle tanks was listing heavily and appeared to be low in the
08:27.480 - 08:33.380:  water. It was struck off the black seaport of Novoresisk, hundreds of kilometers from Ukrainian
08:33.380 - 08:39.980:  controlled territory. Ukraine's security agency says it used a surface marine drone armed with
08:39.980 - 08:46.860:  nearly half a ton of explosives. Russia said it had repelled a drone attack. From Kyiv, our Ukraine
08:46.860 - 08:53.060:  correspondent James Waters reports. In waters dominated by Russia, Ukraine relies on stealth when
08:53.060 - 08:58.480:  it comes to striking Russian targets in the black sea and seavours of. In footage sent to the BBC
08:58.480 - 09:04.140:  by sources in Ukraine Security Service, an onboard camera captures the moment a sea drone moves towards
09:04.140 - 09:09.940:  a Russian warship in Novoresisk. The video breaks up at the point of impact when it's designed to
09:09.940 - 09:15.660:  detonate. Pictures taken in daylight, which have been verified, suggest the damage was heavy,
09:15.660 - 09:20.860:  with the vessel leaning towards the side and being towed to shore. The Novoresisk port is a
09:20.860 - 09:26.840:  major export hub for Russia and an important naval base for its black sea fleet. It's not clear how
09:26.840 - 09:31.280:  much harm it will cause Moscow, but Ukraine's allies have always been nervous about this war
09:31.280 - 09:37.620:  spilling beyond its borders. So, has that stance relaxed? From what senior presidential advisor Mahailo
09:37.620 - 09:47.580:  Yaks says it seems so. It is clear that it is impossible to win the war if you are not actively
09:47.580 - 09:53.800:  attacking. You can't just watch it happen. We are at war. Our partners have already realized it
09:53.800 - 10:00.400:  is not just a small conflict. War is war. It is necessary to destroy the capabilities of the other
10:00.400 - 10:06.740:  side. Ukraine has promised more sea drone attacks and hopes they will put Russia off
10:07.000 - 10:11.900:  from flexing its muscles on the black sea. It's clearly trying to counter punch where it can,
10:11.900 - 10:17.360:  but with Ukrainian ports being pummeled by Russian drones for the last fortnight, this isn't tipped
10:17.360 - 10:24.480:  for tat. James Waterhouse in Kiev. In the early days of the invasion of Ukraine, experts were
10:24.480 - 10:30.800:  surprised how poorly the Russian army's electronic warfare units performed. But nearly 18 months
10:30.800 - 10:36.540:  later, they are causing significant problems for Ukraine's counteroffensive. In this so-called
10:36.540 - 10:42.660:  Invisible War, Russian systems can affect even the most sophisticated weapons that Ukraine has
10:42.660 - 10:49.400:  received from Western allies and NATO countries. The BBC's Abjelil Abdirisalov reports.
10:52.740 - 10:58.500:  The Ukrainian soldiers' focus is deeply concentrated on watching blue ways on a computer screen.
10:58.620 - 11:09.220:  Occasionally, he draws down some of them on a piece of paper. Then, he picks up a radio and
11:09.220 - 11:16.640:  reads out coordinates of Russian artillery positions. This scene in a dam basement could be from a movie,
11:17.460 - 11:22.080:  and it's probably not a coincidence that the soldiers' coal sign is a land along,
11:22.580 - 11:25.680:  like the famous French film star of the 1970s.
11:28.540 - 11:33.420:  A land is a member of an electronic intelligence unit. His job is to monitor emissions,
11:33.420 - 11:39.680:  signals used by drones, air defense systems, multiple rocket launchers, and other weapons.
11:44.020 - 11:50.120:  He says that Russian forces constantly hunt down units like his. Their mission is part of a hidden
11:50.120 - 11:56.440:  confrontation called electronic warfare. Most modern weapons have electronic devices that
11:56.440 - 12:01.580:  use radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and other frequencies to send or receive data.
12:02.440 - 12:05.120:  That makes them vulnerable to detection and suppression.
12:11.360 - 12:16.060:  A land and his team climb on the roof of an abandoned house and set up an antenna.
12:16.960 - 12:20.020:  His units work helps to build a picture of the battlefield.
12:20.940 - 12:26.560:  Colonel Ivan Pavlenko, chief of electronic warfare department of Ukraine's general staff.
12:26.800 - 12:33.500:  If I see a number of radios in the same place, I understand that this is a common post.
12:34.020 - 12:42.420:  If I see this something changed or some radios begin to move ahead, I understand that maybe it
12:42.420 - 12:47.340:  would be a counter-offensive or offensive. After a poor performance at the beginning of
12:47.340 - 12:53.100:  its full-scale invasion, Russian electronic warfare systems today are significantly slowing down
12:53.100 - 12:58.840:  Ukrainian counter-offensive. Brian Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, believes that
12:58.840 - 13:03.160:  changes in the dynamics and location of the war are the reasons for that.
13:03.360 - 13:09.820:  Russia has deployed, for example, Zydel, which is their GPS jammer. They've deployed those
13:10.200 - 13:16.000:  every few dozen miles along the front. And then Russian communication jammers are deployed at
13:16.000 - 13:22.300:  even greater numbers than their GPS jammers. So you're talking about hundreds of jammers
13:22.640 - 13:27.760:  right along the front lines to jam the radio communications that Ukrainians depend on to
13:27.760 - 13:32.780:  coordinate this counter-offensive. Russia has significantly improved its capabilities to jam
13:32.780 - 13:38.520:  satellite links like GPS, and that is already hurting Ukraine a lot, because most modern weapons
13:38.520 - 13:44.740:  they receive from NATO countries use a GPS signal for navigation. When suppressed, even high
13:44.740 - 13:50.660:  precision missiles and rockets can miss their target. That is why both sides are on the hunt for
13:50.660 - 13:57.120:  each other's electronic warfare system. The unit's position is compromised, so they need to change
13:57.120 - 14:03.100:  their location. The key in electronic warfare is being invisible to your enemy.
14:06.960 - 14:12.840:  That report by Abdul-Jalil Abdul-Assalov. Countries from the West African regional body
14:12.840 - 14:17.640:  ECUAS say they've now agreed on a plan for possible military intervention in Niger.
14:18.260 - 14:22.180:  If the military who sees power there don't restore the country's president.
14:22.220 - 14:27.700:  The organisation had earlier set a deadline of Sunday to reinstate Mohammed Basum.
14:28.320 - 14:33.960:  ECUAS Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, Abdul-Fatamusa says this operation
14:33.960 - 14:39.860:  is being coordinated at the highest level. It was, it's not going to tell the conflict,
14:40.740 - 14:47.220:  when and where we are going to strike. That is an operational decision that will be taken by the
14:47.520 - 14:52.280:  head of state who are going to be like the commander's chief of this operation.
14:53.020 - 14:59.380:  ECUAS is also attempting to mediate. A delegation visited Niger on Thursday but failed to meet
14:59.380 - 15:04.380:  the coup leader or the deposed president. Correspondents say military intervention would be
15:04.380 - 15:10.460:  logistically extremely difficult and risky as it could cause further destabilisation in a
15:10.460 - 15:17.360:  region already badly hit by jihadist insurgencies. The government in Ethiopia has declared
15:17.360 - 15:23.160:  a state of emergency in the Ahmara region in the north of the country after days of clashes
15:23.160 - 15:28.320:  between national defence force soldiers and local militias. The Prime Minister's office says
15:28.320 - 15:33.420:  constitutional order there is under threat. Telecommunication links have been cut,
15:33.420 - 15:39.200:  making it hard to verify details. ArAfrica regional editor Will Ross told us more.
15:40.020 - 15:45.660:  There's a great deal of unhappiness in Ahmara because during the two-year Tigray war,
15:45.660 - 15:53.060:  the Ahmara backed the government. Prime Minister Abbi Ahmed got a lot of support from Ahmara
15:53.060 - 15:59.920:  people who took up guns and went to fight against the Tigrayans. But after that as part of the kind of
16:00.220 - 16:05.140:  let's make up and find peace, there was an agreement or at least a decision was taken
16:05.180 - 16:13.100:  to get all the guns off the Tigrayans and to get the guns off the Ahmara who were part of basically
16:13.100 - 16:18.880:  a state-backed security force. And they felt, well you take away all our guns now after we've
16:18.880 - 16:24.780:  helped you, we're then going to be very vulnerable to attacks, not only from Tigrayans if they choose
16:24.780 - 16:30.360:  to attack us, but also there are land disputes with the Oromo. So there's a lot of things going on
16:30.360 - 16:37.080:  here, but the Ahmara feel very badly let down by the government. And so right across parts of
16:37.080 - 16:43.000:  the Ahmara region now in the small villages, there are these local militias who are basically
16:43.000 - 16:49.020:  causing chaos and trying to make the state look ungovernable it seems. And those are the Fano.
16:49.760 - 16:56.420:  Those are the Fano, so they are people who know the terrain very well, difficult for outside troops
16:56.420 - 17:01.640:  to come and defeat them. It doesn't look as though they're trying to capture large towns,
17:01.640 - 17:06.980:  but they did for a few hours. They managed to seize the airport just outside Lallibella town.
17:07.480 - 17:13.520:  Today we understand that flights have been cancelled to at least three towns across the Ahmara
17:13.520 - 17:18.520:  regions. That gives you an idea of the sort of chaos they're causing even if they don't have the
17:18.780 - 17:24.600:  the wherewithal to hold on to to the key strategic towns and cities. And do you think the Ethiopian
17:24.600 - 17:29.160:  government's attitude is that this will have to be sorted out through talking? Certainly that was
17:29.160 - 17:34.460:  the initial call from the the president of the Ahmara region. He said we're open to dialogue,
17:34.460 - 17:40.040:  we want dialogue, but within 24 hours of saying that he sent out on appeal to the federal government
17:40.040 - 17:45.140:  and said this is spiraling out of control, we need extra measures, please help. And then we got
17:45.140 - 17:49.340:  this state of emergency. But as some people have pointed out one of the problems will be with
17:49.340 - 17:54.980:  dialogue is who on earth do you talk to? You've got hundreds and hundreds of tiny kind of neighborhood
17:54.980 - 18:01.840:  almost vigilante groups that have sprung up. They don't have an overall leadership so it might
18:01.840 - 18:09.000:  be very difficult to solve this through dialogue. Will Ross. Now to Iran and a wildfire caused by
18:09.000 - 18:15.480:  high temperatures as set of explosions outside Tehran's notorious Evan Prison. The blaze has now
18:15.480 - 18:21.620:  been brought under control. Here's Mike Thompson. Iranian state media say the blaze which began in
18:21.620 - 18:28.280:  grassland detonated land mines in a security zone around the jail. The facility is the main
18:28.280 - 18:33.760:  site for holding political prisoners as well as foreigners and dissidents who took part in
18:33.760 - 18:40.420:  recent nationwide protests. A fire there last October ripped through a section of the jail killing
18:40.420 - 18:46.380:  at least eight people. It's been a week of scorching weather in Iran with temperatures topping
18:46.380 - 18:57.120:  50 degrees Celsius. Mike Thompson. Still to come. A century ago there were as many as one million
18:57.120 - 19:02.680:  mating pairs of the small black and white bird on the coasts of southern Africa. But now the number
19:02.680 - 19:08.980:  of African penguins has dropped significantly so will a fishing band help stop their decline.
19:14.340 - 19:18.740:  From the passion of the fans. Yes, what did you think of the match? The match was amazing,
19:18.800 - 19:23.920:  it was so nice to see so many Nigerians coming up. To the atmosphere of the competition.
19:24.100 - 19:29.240:  The game, the crowd, the atmosphere was absolutely amazing. I am now a converted New Zealand fan.
19:29.500 - 19:33.800:  World football at the Women's World Cup is the podcast from the BBC World Service
19:33.800 - 19:37.840:  capturing all the excitement of the tournament here in Australia and New Zealand.
19:38.320 - 19:42.700:  Listen now by searching for World Football wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
19:44.400 - 19:49.020:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Negotiations are continuing in the
19:49.020 - 19:55.040:  Colombian capital Bogota of a weather Nicolas Petro, the son of President Gustava Petro,
19:55.360 - 20:01.080:  should be placed under house arrest or held in prison. This is after he admitted channeling
20:01.080 - 20:05.480:  money from a drug trafficker to his father's presidential campaign last year.
20:06.180 - 20:11.160:  President Petro says he knew nothing about the illegal activity and ordered a police inquiry
20:11.160 - 20:15.640:  last March. I got more from our Latin America correspondent Luis Fajado.
20:16.380 - 20:21.980:  Nicolas Petro is accused of having taken money from a convicted criminal who once served
20:21.980 - 20:27.040:  the sentence for drug trafficking. And moreover, he says that part of the money he took during
20:27.040 - 20:33.140:  the presidential campaign of 2022 actually ended up as campaign funds, which of course is a
20:33.140 - 20:38.880:  criminal offense. And what about his father, the president's rule in all this? Did he know about it?
20:39.260 - 20:42.500:  That is the crucial question that many people in Colombia are asking.
20:43.140 - 20:49.560:  President Petro has denied any wrongdoing. He has also said that he respects what the judiciary
20:49.660 - 20:55.440:  might decide about his son, but he says he had nothing to do with it. It certainly has created
20:55.440 - 21:01.880:  already a huge political crisis for President Petro, perhaps the biggest corruption scandal in
21:01.880 - 21:07.880:  decades in Colombia, where a lot of people have criticized him, particularly because of what he
21:07.880 - 21:12.760:  stood for when he ran for president. Again, he was the first ever left-wing president of Colombia,
21:12.760 - 21:18.660:  and he had runs explicitly on a campaign against corruption. And now a lot of people are accusing,
21:18.660 - 21:23.500:  of course, his government of not having lived up to this to this ideal and this hope. And this
21:23.500 - 21:29.960:  is creating a very big political crisis, which many people are afraid that will cause many problems
21:29.960 - 21:36.660:  in his intentions to implement a very ambitious social reform agenda. Now they think he might be
21:36.660 - 21:41.480:  forced to spend the rest of his presidential term defending himself from these attacks.
21:41.980 - 21:44.980:  And what is his son saying about these accusations?
21:45.620 - 21:52.980:  Nicolas Petro again has said that he personally received these funds. He has already confessed to
21:52.980 - 21:58.580:  authorities. He entered a plea bargain deal with prosecutors in which he agreed to give more
21:58.580 - 22:04.560:  information about corruption in the campaign in exchange for leniency. Again, the very damaging
22:04.560 - 22:09.980:  remark he says is that part of this money, not only he kept for himself, but he also had it enter
22:10.580 - 22:16.180:  campaign funds. And in that sense, he would have contaminated, I guess, the presidential campaign
22:16.180 - 22:23.040:  that elected Petro. And where is Nicolas Petro now? Nicolas Petro is attending judiciary proceedings
22:23.180 - 22:30.260:  in the capital in Bogota. And later today, judges are expected to decide if they grant him the
22:30.260 - 22:37.260:  benefit of house arrest instead of being directly sent to a jail. If he is convicted, he would face
22:37.260 - 22:45.160:  many years in jail. Luis Fajado. Now to South Korea and thousands of children attending the
22:45.160 - 22:50.160:  World Scout Jamboree there have been moved to hotels because of a heat wave in the country.
22:50.660 - 22:57.040:  Temperatures soar to 35 degrees Celsius at the campsite near the southwestern town of Boon this
22:57.040 - 23:02.280:  week, leading to hundreds of young people requiring medical attention for heat-related illnesses.
23:03.020 - 23:07.840:  The authorities are facing criticism for failing to prepare adequately for the international
23:07.840 - 23:14.420:  event. Our sole correspondent June McKenzie reports, 40,000 scouts from around the world descended
23:14.540 - 23:21.940:  on a pot of reclaimed land to camp for two weeks during a blazing heat wave. A lack of shade and
23:21.940 - 23:26.040:  air conditioning have been blamed for hundreds of teenagers needing medical attention.
23:26.680 - 23:31.380:  There have been complaints about the facilities, the food and the access to water.
23:32.060 - 23:38.660:  Some have saved the years for this once-in-a-lifetime experience, leaving parents angry and concerned.
23:38.860 - 23:44.720:  One parent, Peter Noljert, said South Korean officials weren't prepared for the event.
23:45.000 - 23:50.960:  Obviously they knew that there were 47,000 young people coming from all over the world and
23:50.980 - 23:55.820:  there have been issues with sanitation, there have been issues with not getting enough drinking water.
23:55.820 - 23:58.460:  Just basically, it's really like not having enough food.
23:58.640 - 24:04.300:  The government has been hastily trying to turn things around, promising to send air-conditioned
24:04.300 - 24:08.740:  buses and medical staff. June McKenzie in South Korea
24:09.780 - 24:14.260:  In China, there's been a break in the storms that have caused widespread flooding and
24:14.260 - 24:20.180:  extensive damage, leaving at least 21 people dead, according to the authorities and more than
24:20.180 - 24:25.640:  a million people evacuated from their homes. The decision was taken to try and take pressure off
24:25.640 - 24:31.360:  the capital Beijing by diverting the water. As our China media analyst Carrie Allen explains,
24:31.820 - 24:34.280:  that led to neighbouring areas paying the price.
24:35.160 - 24:40.520:  It's absolutely devastating. There have been many reports over the last week talking about how
24:40.520 - 24:45.620:  Beijing and neighbouring Herbe Province have seen some of the worst flooding in decades.
24:45.620 - 24:50.520:  So a report today, the Shinhua News Agency, says that the Haihara River Basin, which encompasses
24:50.520 - 24:56.840:  these two regions, has seen the worst flooding since 1963. And the water depth is around two
24:56.840 - 25:03.860:  metres deep and there have been attempts to try and offset this by releasing water into surrounding
25:03.920 - 25:10.720:  regions, largely regions outside of Beijing in Herbe Province. And this had devastating consequences
25:10.720 - 25:16.640:  and there's no sign that the water is going to subside any time soon. It could take at least
25:16.640 - 25:22.000:  a month to do so. So they diverted the water away from the capital. What happened?
25:22.840 - 25:29.880:  In Herbe Province, there has been flooding in particularly a city called Dwarjo and it has led to
25:29.880 - 25:35.240:  more than a million people have been relocated in Herbe Province. And it has led to a lot of frustration
25:35.320 - 25:41.140:  but also a lot of fear because there are elderly populations in these regions and a lot of the
25:41.140 - 25:46.280:  media that I've seen over the last few days that has dominated Chinese national broadcasters and
25:46.280 - 25:53.160:  in newspapers has been small children and also the elderly being rescued from these cities that
25:53.160 - 25:58.060:  weren't badly affected by the flooding and then suddenly saw their houses destroyed.
25:58.760 - 26:05.760:  And yet we have certainly one person and authority proudly declaring that the province of
26:05.760 - 26:09.960:  Haibi would act as a moat to protect Beijing. What's been a reaction to that?
26:10.600 - 26:16.080:  There has been obviously a lot of criticism of this but so what happens in China is that whenever
26:16.080 - 26:21.060:  anything happens like this and flooding is very common this time of year, you'll see an emphasis
26:21.740 - 26:27.780:  on the positives in terms of the huge community efforts of people to come together and to try
26:27.780 - 26:34.200:  to help. So a lot of media footage very much focusing on firefighters, relief workers, people
26:34.200 - 26:40.740:  within these communities, cooking and looking after people. So a lot of focus on the positives
26:40.740 - 26:45.880:  rather than on the negatives and this has been a long-running thing in China that you'll often see
26:45.880 - 26:50.960:  this rather than criticism of the government. In fact, on social media platforms like Weibo
26:51.000 - 26:54.720:  it's very common to see criticism of the Communist Party be censored.
26:55.440 - 27:01.340:  Kerry Allen. Here in Britain a court has found a social media influencer and her mother guilty
27:01.340 - 27:07.120:  of murdering two men who died when their car was rammed off the road. It followed a dispute of
27:07.120 - 27:13.500:  an affair between one of the men and the mother of Tik Tok Star, Mahak Bakari. Navtav Joha reports
27:13.500 - 27:19.860:  from Leicester in central England. Mahak Bakari wanted to be known as a social media influencer,
27:19.860 - 27:26.460:  spending much of her time on Tik Tok. But it was the events in her life off-line that have now made
27:26.460 - 27:35.860:  her infamous. This is a video she didn't post online. Police body cam footage of her and her
27:35.860 - 27:42.160:  mother's arrest on suspicion of murder in February last year. They arrived at this point due to a
27:42.160 - 27:49.480:  three-year relationship between her mother, 46-year-old answering Bakari and 21-year-old Sikib Hussein.
27:50.320 - 27:55.300:  Bakar heard that when Bakari broke off the affair, Sikib Hussein threatened to send sexually
27:55.300 - 28:00.900:  explicit material of her to her husband and son if she didn't repay him money that he claimed
28:00.900 - 28:05.860:  it spent on her. In response, the jury were told that the mother and daughter hatched a plot with
28:05.860 - 28:10.800:  the help of others to seize Mr. Hussein's phone containing the explicit material. He agreed to
28:10.800 - 28:15.040:  meet them in Leicester under the belief that he'd be receiving payment. He was driven there by
28:15.040 - 28:20.500:  his close friend Hashim Ijazuddin. But the proposed meeting quickly became a deadly chase,
28:20.500 - 28:26.480:  with Mahak and answering Bakari and their group in two cars following the two young men in their
28:26.480 - 28:32.700:  vehicle. On the A-46 is where the crash took place. Just beforehand, Sikib Hussein was an
28:32.700 - 28:38.640:  a 999 call, telling the operator that he was being followed by people wearing balaclava's.
28:38.820 - 28:45.480:  He says, the try to ram us off the road. Please, I'm begging you, I think I'm going to die.
28:45.920 - 28:50.460:  Mahak Bakari, her mother and two others have been found guilty of the men's murder,
28:51.000 - 28:55.720:  while three others were convicted of manslaughter. They will be sentenced next month.
28:56.420 - 29:02.720:  Navtaj Mohal. South Africa says it will introduce a 10-year ban on fishing near colonies of
29:02.720 - 29:07.500:  critically endangered African penguins. Ministers are warning that unless action is taken,
29:07.900 - 29:12.340:  the birds could be extinct by 2035. As the Allied reports.
29:16.280 - 29:21.340:  A century ago, there were as many as one million mating pairs of the small black and white bird
29:21.340 - 29:27.580:  on the coasts of southern Africa. But today, it's believed this number has fallen to just 10,000.
29:28.320 - 29:33.260:  African penguins are like all penguins, flightless, and rely on the sea for their food.
29:33.920 - 29:39.200:  Barbara Creasy, South Africa's Environment Minister, says competition for fish is thought to be
29:39.200 - 29:45.060:  a major contributor to their decline. It's hoped that by stopping fishing around six key locations,
29:45.760 - 29:48.720:  the species can be brought back from the brink of extinction.
29:49.680 - 29:53.220:  Thea White. And now to Scotland and the Edinburgh,
29:53.220 - 29:57.900:  Fringe, the world's largest performance arts festival, which is just kicked off.
29:57.900 - 30:02.980:  Thousands of shows are being performed in all sorts of venues, for actors who are less well-known,
30:02.980 - 30:09.120:  it can be hard to get noticed. So, spare thought for Georgie Greer, who performed her one
30:09.120 - 30:14.740:  woman show on Thursday night with only one person in the audience. She shared a post about it
30:14.740 - 30:20.520:  on social media, and the reaction has been overwhelming. Georgie Greer told the BBC, what happened?
30:21.460 - 30:26.720:  It's preview week, so I knew it would be a struggle for numbers. I had eight on the first day,
30:27.000 - 30:31.520:  so I was like, well, that was a really good turnout, feeling, you know, optimistic, although I
30:31.520 - 30:35.980:  know it's a marathon, not a sprint. But each time again, you get nervous, and then there was a
30:35.980 - 30:41.080:  bit of a conversation outside of the theatre where my technician came out, and I was like, he's
30:41.080 - 30:47.640:  never normally out here, what's he doing? And it came to be that, you know, there was just one person
30:47.640 - 30:53.860:  there, and I was obviously quite upset, but I knew it was preview week, I knew it was going to be hard,
30:54.460 - 30:58.380:  but I just thought, you know, I have to get on with this, I have to treat this like a dress rehearsal,
30:58.380 - 31:04.020:  but then I think it all just came out afterwards, and that's when I had a cry. I didn't want to
31:04.020 - 31:12.740:  call my mum crying, so I thought the hashtag Ed Fringe community on social media has been a
31:12.740 - 31:18.000:  really supportive place, and I thought, oh, you know, you know, might find a couple of other people
31:18.000 - 31:23.480:  who had one person, might get some words of comfort from someone else, might be able to comfort
31:23.480 - 31:30.340:  someone else who had one person. I did not expect the level of reaction. It's been so lovely,
31:30.340 - 31:37.560:  so unexpected, so many words for what I've experienced, but yeah, I'm just so appreciative of the
31:37.560 - 31:43.080:  support. So I've got to do it for the rest of the month, including today, but it's put a spring in
31:43.080 - 31:48.000:  my step for sure, but of course, there's no guarantee still of ticket sales. I love the support,
31:48.000 - 31:53.700:  but I will never know who's there until I walk into that theatre, and we'll be grateful if anyone
31:54.060 - 32:00.780:  turns up. Well, Georgie has now done her next show, so how did it go? It went really well,
32:00.780 - 32:05.800:  there was more than one. It went really well, it was so nice to have people smiling faces there,
32:05.800 - 32:11.680:  and I'm so grateful to each and every person who came. Ah, that's a nice ending Georgie career there.
32:13.440 - 32:17.160:  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later,
32:17.160 - 32:21.700:  if you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, send us an email,
32:21.700 - 32:28.820:  the address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk, and you can also find us on Twitter at Global News Pod.
32:29.180 - 32:33.600:  This edition was mixed by Paul Mason, the producer was Liam McChefrey, the editor is ever
32:33.920 - 32:37.240:  Is Karen Martin. I'm Valerie Sanderson and until next time, bye bye.
