00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.580:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:19.380 - 00:24.640:  I'm Janet Chalille and in the early hours of Monday 21st August, these are our main stories.
00:25.160 - 00:30.400:  A huge tropical storm has caused flooding in parts of Mexico as it heads towards the south
00:30.400 - 00:35.360:  west of the United States. The people of Ecuador have voted in elections that have been
00:35.360 - 00:41.940:  overshadowed by political assassinations and soaring violence. The West African grouping Echoos
00:41.940 - 00:47.120:  has rejected an announcement by the co-leader in Niger that it will be three years before
00:47.120 - 00:59.560:  civilian rule is restored. Also in this podcast, Injir is a natural antidepressant. He's positive,
00:59.840 - 01:04.900:  cuddly and nice and he's helping people find hope and light inside themselves.
01:05.220 - 01:11.540:  The power of cats and dogs to help Ukrainians deal with the impact of Russia's invasion.
01:16.960 - 01:21.720:  As we record this podcast, the U.S. State of California is bracing itself for tropical storm
01:21.720 - 01:26.460:  Hillary, which has already brought fierce winds and flooding to Mexico's Pacific coast.
01:27.120 - 01:32.140:  One man died in the Mexican state of Baja California after his vehicle was swept away in rising
01:32.140 - 01:38.020:  waters. Hillary is expected to be the first tropical storm to hit southern California in more than
01:38.020 - 01:43.460:  80 years amid warnings that it could bring a year's worth of rain in places that are normally very
01:43.460 - 01:49.380:  dry. The Los Angeles Police Department chief Michael Moore warned conditions could be life-threatening.
01:49.760 - 01:53.640:  What we need from our public is our cooperation. We need their help and assistance
01:53.660 - 01:59.680:  and avoiding travel wherever possible. If, by nature, their assignment or job or position,
01:59.680 - 02:04.360:  they find themselves as needing to travel, that they're mindful of the weather conditions
02:04.360 - 02:09.640:  around them. Vehicles can become immobilized and people's lives can be endangered by
02:09.640 - 02:13.440:  simply driving through a pool of water with unknown depth or content.
02:14.180 - 02:18.720:  For more on this unusual storm, I spoke to our correspondent in Los Angeles Peter Boes.
02:19.000 - 02:27.020:  This is very, very unusual. Normally, we go through a summer in the Los Angeles area without any rain
02:27.480 - 02:33.940:  at all. So to be getting this quantity of rain in late August is extremely unusual.
02:33.940 - 02:40.220:  And it's already started raining. I'm in Los Angeles right now. It's been raining for several hours
02:40.660 - 02:46.720:  and clearly the hurricane itself, which is now downgraded to a tropical storm, is still far away,
02:46.720 - 02:53.540:  still several hours away. In fact, it hasn't even crossed the border yet from Mexico to California,
02:54.000 - 02:58.400:  but we're still getting this rain. So that is potentially a sign of things to come a little bit
02:58.400 - 03:04.780:  later in the day when the eye of the storm travels over the Los Angeles area. And the forecasters
03:04.780 - 03:09.040:  at this stage are not even certain which direction it's going to go. Once it's across the border,
03:09.040 - 03:14.000:  it'll first of all hit the city of San Diego. It could then travel inland, which would see it heading
03:14.000 - 03:20.080:  off towards Las Vegas, or it could move further towards the coast and the resort Santa Monica,
03:20.080 - 03:28.080:  Ventura, even maybe even as far as Malibu. But at this stage, it's still in Mexico and everyone
03:28.080 - 03:33.140:  is just holding their breath here. We heard there a warning from the police. What are the main
03:33.140 - 03:41.160:  concerns? The main concern is the sheer quantity of rain, the quantity of water that will be dumped on
03:41.160 - 03:48.860:  extremely dry terrain, dry landscape in Los Angeles and surrounding areas very typical for this
03:48.860 - 03:54.600:  time of year, potentially in some of those areas that have been burned by the wildfires either
03:54.600 - 03:59.700:  earlier this year or indeed in previous years. It makes those hillsides extremely unstable
03:59.700 - 04:04.400:  when they're hit with large quantities of rain. So the last few hours, people have been trying
04:04.400 - 04:10.260:  to shore up those hillsides that are known to be vulnerable. People have been getting the free
04:10.260 - 04:16.140:  sunbanks from their local fire station. People have been heading out to stores and stocking up on
04:16.440 - 04:23.060:  emergency things like water and batteries as a warning of power cuts, potentially over the next
04:23.060 - 04:29.900:  few hours, just preparing for this catastrophic emergency as it's been described by the authorities
04:29.900 - 04:37.640:  that could unfold in the next 12 hours. Peter Boes in Los Angeles. Ecuadorians cast their votes on
04:37.640 - 04:43.320:  Sunday in elections that have been overshadowed by political assassinations and high levels of violence
04:43.320 - 04:49.260:  driven by foreign drug mafias. The presidential and legislative elections were triggered by President
04:49.260 - 04:55.320:  Guillermo Lasso to avoid being impeached on embezzlement charges. One presidential candidate was
04:55.320 - 05:01.260:  gunned down early this month as he left a campaign event. Speaking in the city of Guayaquil after
05:01.260 - 05:06.380:  casting his vote, Mr. Lasso said he hoped for a peaceful atmosphere so the government could
05:06.380 - 05:16.280:  concentrate on helping its citizens. I hope that the people's decision will be known today.
05:16.840 - 05:21.940:  It should be respected in an atmosphere of peace and tranquility in order to address the most
05:21.940 - 05:29.000:  pressing problems of the Ecuadorian people. I got more on how the day went from our South
05:29.000 - 05:34.660:  America correspondent Katie Watson, who's in keto. There was a lot of fear heading up to the vote.
05:34.660 - 05:38.220:  You know, people who felt that they were a bit nervous about going out to vote. It's a
05:38.220 - 05:43.500:  obligatory to vote so that certainly makes people get out and vote. But speaking to people here in
05:43.500 - 05:48.580:  the centres, you know, everybody feels that it's really important to be able to choose the direction
05:48.580 - 05:53.300:  of politics, especially given what's happened, you know, not just in the campaign, but over the last
05:53.300 - 05:58.140:  few years the growing violence, growing organised crime in this country. But certainly the one
05:58.140 - 06:04.080:  unifying issue is security and peace and just a safer environment for families to grow here.
06:04.320 - 06:10.160:  And who were the main candidates? So the leading candidate is Luisa Gonzalez. She's a former
06:10.160 - 06:16.000:  protégé of Rafael Correa, who was a president who has got a mixed legacy. He, you know,
06:16.000 - 06:20.760:  was very big on social programmes. He was in charge of Ecuador during the commodities boom,
06:20.760 - 06:26.960:  but he was also mired in corruption scandals and he now is an exile in Belgium. And she was leading
06:26.960 - 06:31.860:  the polls. Everybody talked about the fact that for another Vicenteo's death has appended those,
06:32.180 - 06:36.000:  you know, and who knows what's going to happen now. But certainly she looks like she's still in the
06:36.000 - 06:41.100:  lead. Jacque Perez is another interesting candidate, environmentalist and an indigenous leader.
06:41.100 - 06:45.280:  So there was lots of different people but all wanting the same, which is peace and security here.
06:46.020 - 06:52.360:  Katie Watson in Ecuador. Russia's first moon mission in nearly 50 years has ended in failure.
06:52.980 - 06:59.220:  The country's space agency Roscosmos said its lunar 25 spacecraft, which was unmanned, spun out
06:59.220 - 07:05.160:  of control and crashed into the surface of the moon. It was Russia's first launch into outer space
07:05.440 - 07:09.000:  since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Paul Moss has the details.
07:14.840 - 07:20.040:  It started well enough. Just over a week ago, a Soyuz rocket blasted off from Russia's
07:20.040 - 07:25.880:  Vostoshni Cosmodrome in the country's Far East. On board, a landing craft that was supposed to
07:25.880 - 07:29.220:  prove that Russia was well and truly back in the space race.
07:31.160 - 07:37.940:  Lunar 25 had an important scientific mission. Landing at the moon's south pole, it would investigate
07:37.940 - 07:43.780:  whether the surface had ice underneath. But Lunar 25 was launched with Russia under sanctions,
07:43.780 - 07:49.660:  so its space agency couldn't get hold of some technical equipment it wanted. Had the mission
07:49.660 - 07:55.160:  succeeded, President Putin would have been able to say it proved the country's resilience in the
07:55.160 - 08:00.900:  face of Western hostility. Instead, he'll be trying to find out why Lunar 25 crashed,
08:01.420 - 08:07.660:  and there could be more humiliation. India's Chandrian 3 spacecraft is due to attempt to south pole
08:07.660 - 08:14.180:  landing on Wednesday. This relative newcomer to the space race potentially succeeding where Russia failed.
08:15.040 - 08:20.280:  Paul Moss, what exactly went wrong then, and where does this leave Russia's space ambitions?
08:20.800 - 08:26.300:  Dr Stephen Hall is assistant professor of Russian politics at the University of Bath in southern
08:26.300 - 08:32.280:  England. We don't quite know what went wrong. I've seen some reports that said that it went on
08:32.280 - 08:38.260:  a different trajectory. I've seen some reports that said that the stabilization system that's
08:38.260 - 08:43.680:  supposed to speed it up and break it down, you know, failed as well. So when they were trying to
08:44.200 - 08:51.200:  push it into its trajectory towards the moon, the braking system failed, and it hit the moon at
08:51.200 - 08:57.180:  1.5 times more velocity than it should have done. Or it spiraled out of control. We simply don't know
08:57.180 - 09:02.440:  yet, but it's certainly a disaster for Roscosmos, the Russian space agency.
09:02.920 - 09:06.860:  Very much a dent in Russia's space ambitions, you would say.
09:07.080 - 09:14.580:  Oh, absolutely. I mean, for regime like Putin's, the spies to not recreating the USSR, but
09:15.000 - 09:21.560:  being the legacy of the Soviet Union and space was a big part of that legacy. It certainly is
09:21.960 - 09:28.340:  a failure. It's the first time that Russia has tried to send a probe or even some sort of lunar
09:28.340 - 09:35.700:  object to the moon. So this naturally is a huge dent in Roscosmos' image and in the Russian
09:35.700 - 09:43.180:  governments as well. But more immediately, this was a lost race against India, was it not?
09:43.640 - 09:48.940:  Well, yes, it certainly was. I mean, here was Russia, as I said, the legacy of the Soviet Union
09:48.940 - 09:54.400:  being accused. It still needed to show that it was a great power in terms of the space race,
09:54.400 - 09:59.380:  if you want to call it that. It's now behind China, but it could still plausibly have beaten India.
09:59.780 - 10:05.720:  And interestingly, we saw Sergei Markov, a Kremlin propagandist on his telegram channel,
10:05.720 - 10:12.060:  saying, well, it's unfortunate, but good luck to the Indians. So I think they've accepted that
10:12.060 - 10:17.980:  India is going to land its probe on the moon, and Russia is going to be relegated to the fourth,
10:17.980 - 10:22.440:  if not the fifth or sixth space country, as it were.
10:22.880 - 10:28.200:  Russia has already announced that a special commission will be set up to look into why
10:28.720 - 10:32.400:  the commission failed. So can we expect heads to roll?
10:32.780 - 10:39.400:  Putin appointed the recent Roscosmos leader, so it's very unlikely that he would allow him to
10:39.940 - 10:45.120:  be removed. Putin does not like to have to remove people close to him, and he certainly doesn't
10:45.120 - 10:51.500:  like to have to remove people who are appointed by him. So I don't think that there will certainly
10:51.500 - 10:56.640:  be that major heads will roll. I think it will be that they will find a scapegoat or they will
10:56.640 - 11:01.140:  blame failed technology, and that will be the how it will end.
11:01.640 - 11:09.320:  Is it possible, though, that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has had an effect in some way or
11:09.320 - 11:15.940:  other on its space program? Absolutely, in terms of the fact that 2023, it was announced that Roscosmos
11:15.940 - 11:22.120:  is 60 billion rebels in debt, which is about just under 500 or 1 million pounds. It is also the
11:22.120 - 11:29.240:  fact that there were lots of international agreements that Roscosmos was working with other
11:29.240 - 11:35.300:  space agencies in Europe, with NASA as well, and these have obviously gone by the wayside,
11:35.440 - 11:40.300:  and certainly Russia's technology, at least domestic technology does not have the same capacity
11:40.300 - 11:46.160:  as the Western, as American technology. Russia was very reliant on that, and with the war in
11:46.160 - 11:51.320:  Ukraine, that is also gone. That was Dr. Stephen Hall speaking to Julian Marshall.
11:51.840 - 11:57.540:  Descendants of the 19th century British Prime Minister William Gladstone have said their ancestors'
11:57.540 - 12:03.020:  ownership of slaves amounted to a crime against humanity. The Prime Minister was the son of
12:03.020 - 12:08.420:  John Gladstone, one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies. His great, great,
12:08.420 - 12:14.280:  great grandson, Charlie Gladstone and other family members, will travel to South America to
12:14.280 - 12:20.960:  apologise and pay reparations as Harry Fahley reports. Charlie Gladstone said he felt absolutely
12:20.960 - 12:26.960:  sick when he found out about his family's slave owning past. His ancestor, John Gladstone,
12:26.960 - 12:32.240:  was a merchant who owned hundreds of enslaved workers, toiling on sugar plantations in the
12:32.240 - 12:38.940:  Demerara region of Guyana. After slavery was abolished in 1833, he received the modern equivalent of
12:38.940 - 12:44.460:  around 10 million pounds in compensation. John Gladstone's son, the Liberal Prime Minister
12:44.460 - 12:49.880:  William Gladstone, began his career defending his father, before later describing slavery as
12:49.880 - 12:56.180:  the foulest crime that taints the history of mankind. Six members of the Gladstone family will
12:56.180 - 13:02.180:  travel to Guyana this week for the 200th anniversary of an uprising in 1823 that was brutally
13:02.180 - 13:07.900:  suppressed by their ancestor. They will pay reparations towards further research into the
13:07.900 - 13:13.480:  impact of slavery and apologise for John Gladstone's actions. In a statement to the BBC,
13:13.480 - 13:18.820:  the Gladstone family said, we know that we can't change the past, but we believe that we can make
13:18.820 - 13:25.020:  a better future. Harry Fahley. Vienna's central cemetery, the second largest in Europe is where
13:25.020 - 13:30.680:  the composers, Beethoven, Schubert and Johann Strauss are buried. But rather incongruously,
13:30.680 - 13:36.040:  people are also now growing vegetables there. Bethany Bell has been there to find out why.
13:36.520 - 13:42.700:  If you wander through these tree-lined avenues in Vienna's central cemetery with their rows
13:42.700 - 13:50.580:  of imposing tombs, I've just passed one which has got a great stone statue of a weeping angel on it,
13:51.500 - 13:58.360:  you come across this large vegetable garden, just a short walk from Beethoven's grave.
14:00.240 - 14:05.320:  And here watering the plants is Rita from the Urban Gardening Group, Akahelden.
14:06.720 - 14:12.380:  So we have an organic vegetable garden here. We grow several different vegetables from Onions,
14:12.440 - 14:20.980:  Tukini. We have aubergines. We have pumpkin, tomatoes, paprika. We have several different salads,
14:21.580 - 14:26.180:  herbs and flowers here as well. And how do they taste? Are they taste wonderful?
14:26.740 - 14:31.740:  Especially because the soil is really, really good. They taste fresh, they taste, they're full of
14:31.740 - 14:37.460:  taste. I just love those vegetables. I don't want to eat any vegetables from supermarkets anymore
14:37.460 - 14:43.740:  because I know where they're coming from. I know that we have no chemicals used to grow them,
14:44.320 - 14:51.500:  and yes, when we harvest them they're ripe. How does it work? How do you get a plot in one of these
14:51.500 - 14:57.460:  cemeteries to grow vegetables? All of our gardeners here, they have family members that are
14:57.460 - 15:02.260:  buried in one of the cemeteries. I think it's really peaceful to work in the garden,
15:02.840 - 15:07.960:  and in my opinion it can help with the process of grief.
15:09.140 - 15:16.160:  Julia Stering is the spokesperson for Vienna cemeteries. She says the allotments are proving popular.
15:16.980 - 15:25.600:  There's an area full of grass not being used for burial sites or graves in the last couple of
15:25.600 - 15:33.080:  years at least. So what we decided is as we're not using it as a grave site, why not
15:33.520 - 15:40.720:  trying erm gardening right here so people can see whether they like it or not. They do as we know now.
15:41.920 - 15:50.280:  And has anyone come up to you and said they feel a bit weird about eating vegetables from a graveyard?
15:51.300 - 15:58.500:  Surprisingly there were very little noises and that were telling us well not really sure whether
15:58.500 - 16:05.280:  that's a good idea or not. So the people who came here knew well there weren't any people buried
16:05.280 - 16:11.840:  before. We used the free area. So no one has actually been buried in this area where the vegetables are?
16:11.920 - 16:17.440:  No one has been buried here. It's interesting to think that this huge cemetery which is the final
16:17.440 - 16:24.480:  resting place for people like Beethoven for Schubert is now also a place where you can get a
16:24.520 - 16:29.860:  carrot or two. I wonder what Beethoven would have thought about that. I'm sure he would have loved it
16:30.000 - 16:36.240:  look over there there's a deer. You're right next to us. Beautiful deer and I understand now why
16:36.240 - 16:43.200:  this garden plot has a fence around it to keep the deer from eating the cabbages. Exactly isn't
16:43.200 - 16:51.940:  it beautiful. That report was by Bethany Bell. Still to come the frame is badly rusted.
16:51.940 - 16:56.840:  There are no wheels, no instruments, no seats but it does have a gearbox.
16:58.220 - 17:03.140:  Why a burnt out shell of a car sold for nearly two million dollars an auction.
17:10.780 - 17:16.600:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Unacceptable. The response of the West African regional
17:16.600 - 17:22.840:  group ECOWAS to Niger's Culeaders after they said returning to democracy would take three years.
17:23.200 - 17:29.080:  ECOWAS has repeatedly threatened to send troops into Niger if last month's coup isn't reversed.
17:29.080 - 17:34.020:  For speaking to the BBC, ECOWAS is Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security,
17:34.020 - 17:40.380:  Abdul Fattar Musa. Suggested the statement by the Nigerian military was in fact a negotiating
17:40.380 - 17:48.520:  tactic. Of course that is not acceptable to equal us and I think that is probably the
17:48.520 - 17:54.880:  our first offer. They are floating a kite and ECOWAS is not going to accept that.
17:55.740 - 18:02.020:  We've had them for the shortest possible time for the restoration or constitutional order
18:02.020 - 18:07.980:  in the country and we stand by it. The Culeaders offer comes after they finally agreed to
18:07.980 - 18:15.000:  meet a delegation from ECOWAS. On Sunday there were demonstrations once again in the capital Niamh
18:15.000 - 18:27.060:  in support of the coup. Some of the placards displayed messages hostile to France, the former
18:27.060 - 18:33.340:  colonial power and to ECOWAS. I asked our reporter Beverly Ochieng where ECOWAS goes from here.
18:33.800 - 18:38.580:  It does feel like uncharted territory, especially in light of some of ECOWAS's previous responses
18:38.580 - 18:44.280:  to other military coups in the region. With Niger it wants to adopt a much tougher stance but every
18:44.280 - 18:49.520:  time there's a tough line of rhetoric we find that the army comes out and it threatens or it
18:49.520 - 18:55.260:  defies that rhetoric. So we saw that just before that deadline to reinstate Basoum had come in
18:55.260 - 19:01.200:  the junta administration closed the airspace of Niger and then as ECOWAS was meeting to discuss
19:01.200 - 19:05.980:  a possible military intervention the junta decided to appoint a fully fledged cabinet.
19:06.460 - 19:10.920:  And then as there was the flurry of meetings with some emissaries from neighboring Nigeria
19:11.100 - 19:16.720:  calls by ECOWAS to intervene. There was still heightened activity by the junta and now they've
19:16.720 - 19:21.920:  announced a three-year transition. It is part of negotiation tactic. The junta does seem to be
19:21.920 - 19:26.180:  keen to stay in power but it is in a fragile position given that Niger is already quite volatile.
19:26.180 - 19:32.880:  This intervention given the readiness of about 10 ECOWAS members is quite serious and the escalation
19:32.880 - 19:38.100:  both of rhetoric as well as the steps by the junta is quite concerning on whether there will be
19:38.100 - 19:44.160:  any sort of pacification between the two sides. Meanwhile, people in Niger are suffering because
19:44.160 - 19:49.520:  of the economic sanctions. We've seen protests yet again on the streets of the capital Niyame,
19:50.080 - 19:54.380:  lots of people turning out waving Russian flags. Is this genuine support for the coup
19:54.660 - 19:58.980:  or is this being staged by the military in order to try to show that there is support for it?
19:59.120 - 20:02.580:  Well it feels like a mixture of both because yes certainly the economic situation as
20:02.580 - 20:07.760:  worse than these been reports of the price of basic commodities such as rice, sugar going up.
20:07.760 - 20:12.900:  The fact that electricity has been unreliable, neighboring Nigeria provides a significant amount
20:12.900 - 20:17.620:  of electricity to Niger and there have been power cuts for some time. But at the same time the
20:17.620 - 20:22.580:  momentum from protests since the military coup has pretty much not stopped. In some instances
20:22.580 - 20:28.260:  you'll find that there's nationwide reports on state TV about pro-hunter protests. Some of it
20:28.260 - 20:33.020:  seems very opportunistic. There are definitely groups of people who have been feeling
20:33.020 - 20:37.900:  despondent because of insecurity and the feeling that the army being in charge might be able to be
20:37.900 - 20:42.340:  an adequate response to security. But if you look at examples such as neighbouring Mali and
20:42.340 - 20:47.900:  Bukina Faso, the army hasn't been an adequate solution to insecurity and insecurity also feeds
20:47.900 - 20:54.460:  into the economy declining over time. But there is a sense of solidarity for the junta even though
20:54.460 - 21:00.140:  at this point those alliances and allegiances and even the groups emerging are still quite fragile.
21:01.000 - 21:06.700:  Beverly Ochiang, anti-government protests over living conditions are reported to be continuing
21:06.700 - 21:13.080:  in serious southern province of Sueda. Unverified videos show hundreds of people gathered in the
21:13.080 - 21:19.640:  provinces capital shouting slogans calling on President Bashar al-Assad to step down. A general
21:19.640 - 21:25.180:  strike has been announced there and shops have been told to close. Such open dissent in government
21:25.180 - 21:30.880:  controlled areas of the country is rare. With the help of allies Russia and Iran, President
21:30.880 - 21:36.660:  Assad has almost managed to win his country's long drawn-out civil war. But his sanctions hit
21:36.660 - 21:42.760:  economy remains in deep trouble. Could protests over economic hardship, like the ones in Sueda,
21:43.260 - 21:48.440:  lead to a new threat to his rule. Here's our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson.
21:53.000 - 21:58.340:  Anger at declining living conditions and the perception of being neglected by the government in
21:58.340 - 22:06.400:  Damascus has been simmering for some time in Sueda. In these protests late last year crowds of people
22:06.400 - 22:12.860:  took to the streets tearing down and burning pictures of President Bashar al-Assad and calling
22:12.860 - 22:19.500:  for him to go. The latest unrest marked by blocked roads and burning tires in the streets
22:19.500 - 22:25.580:  was sparked by government subsidy cuts that have greatly increased fuel and many other prices.
22:26.300 - 22:31.980:  Although this is a Drew's majority area of the country that has remained largely neutral throughout
22:31.980 - 22:38.500:  Syria's long civil war, people here are no fans of the President, who many blame for their
22:38.500 - 22:44.540:  growing economic plight. So far he's unlikely to be threatened by this latest eruption,
22:45.220 - 22:48.740:  but that could soon change if such discontent spreads.
22:49.920 - 22:56.280:  Mike Thompson, a Ferrari racing car from 1954 has sold auction in California for nearly
22:56.280 - 23:03.040:  two million dollars. Doesn't sound too unusual, does it? There is one problem, though. Instead of a
23:03.040 - 23:09.520:  gleaming, powerful machine, it's just a burnt out, rusty, twisted shell which only looks fit for
23:09.520 - 23:15.880:  the scrap heap. So why has someone paid so much for a car wreck? This report from Harry Bly.
23:16.320 - 23:22.220:  A weathered chassis of what was once a celebrated racing car was sold as one of 20 vintage
23:22.220 - 23:28.660:  Ferrari's that were left entirely untouched in a barn in Florida for decades. And this one,
23:28.660 - 23:36.560:  a 1954 Ferrari 500 Mondial Spider Series 1, despite having had an estimate selling price
23:36.880 - 23:42.700:  of between 1.2 and 1.6 million dollars, looks like it's just been pulled out of a scrapyard.
23:42.780 - 23:49.400:  There are no wheels, no instruments, no seats, but it does have a gearbox and it's original
23:49.400 - 23:55.340:  three-liter inline four engine. Of course, those don't work. The frame is badly rusted,
23:55.340 - 24:00.700:  but it has been cleaned up and is described as preserved in its race-damaged condition.
24:01.660 - 24:07.360:  Only 13 of these cars were made and they were designed for the racetrack. This model won the
24:07.360 - 24:14.360:  World Championships twice in the 1950s, giving its name Mondial. This particular car was shipped
24:14.360 - 24:21.580:  to the United States in 1958 and not long after, it was involved in a serious crash. The wreckage
24:21.580 - 24:28.960:  was salvaged and bought by a Ferrari collector named Walter Medlin in 1978, where it went into storage.
24:29.640 - 24:35.200:  And that brings us to the present day, where it and 19 other vintage Ferrari's were being sold
24:35.200 - 24:40.180:  in what was called the Lost and Found Collection by the auction house RM Sotheby's.
24:40.600 - 24:46.080:  The car exceeded its estimate, selling for 1.8 million dollars, which might seem a lot,
24:46.080 - 24:52.860:  but working models of this rare racing car have in the past gone for as much as 5 million dollars.
24:53.440 - 24:59.960:  Harry Blie, cats and dogs, real and cartoon ones have been helping Ukrainians deal with a devastating
24:59.960 - 25:05.780:  impact of Russia's invasion. They've not only offered emotional support, but also featured in
25:05.780 - 25:12.220:  social media accounts raising funds for charity and providing practical advice. Vitaly Chevchenko
25:12.800 - 25:20.360:  Batron is a real dog and he works for Ukraine's state emergency service. There's a postage stamp
25:20.360 - 25:27.060:  with Batron and President Vladimir Zelensky awarded him a medal for dedicated service. He has met
25:27.060 - 25:33.020:  numerous dignitaries and celebrities visiting Kiev. His owner and handler at the emergency service,
25:33.020 - 25:39.460:  Michail Oeliev, tells me that by meeting foreign dignitaries, the diminutive Jack Russell Terrier
25:39.460 - 25:43.560:  has helped secure donations of vital mind-clearing equipment.
25:48.480 - 25:55.140:  Batron, our little brother, our hero, has helped deliver a lot of information to people from abroad.
25:55.820 - 26:02.180:  They have helped us with all sorts of equipment and we've been able to check more land and we can
26:02.700 - 26:11.660:  react faster. Despite his celebrity status, Batron, his name means cartridge, still does his day
26:20.880 - 26:25.800:  job of detecting mines. These sirens are from the Instagram account of Stepan the cat. He hails from
26:25.800 - 26:31.500:  Saltyvka, a district in Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, that was heavily damaged by Russian
26:31.500 - 26:37.440:  shelling. Before the war, Stepan was just another incredibly cute cat from the internet,
26:38.040 - 26:44.220:  but now his account has more political commentary. It has switched from Russian to Ukrainian too.
26:44.720 - 26:51.640:  Last year, Stepan helped raised almost $16,000 to help animals affected by war. His owner,
26:51.640 - 26:58.120:  Anna, told me more in a written message. Stepan, the cat's main mission is to help other animals.
26:58.120 - 27:05.000:  For example, after the Khavkat Dam was destroyed, Stepan was involved in raising funds for the
27:05.000 - 27:10.160:  evocation of animals from flooded areas. And of course, Stepan is trying to help people
27:10.160 - 27:17.340:  particularly children forget the horror of war at least for a little while. So why are cats and
27:17.340 - 27:24.680:  dogs so helpful for raising funds and spreading advice? Here's Ukrainian author, Olena Pavlova.
27:24.960 - 27:31.140:  Khartenko, Scottekom, pictures and names featuring cats can help deliver a lot of important ideas.
27:31.180 - 27:40.540:  They're easier to absorb. Cat pictures help us cope. Olena created a cartoon character called
27:40.600 - 27:50.620:  Injure the cat. His name means fig in Ukrainian. Injure the cat is a natural and
27:50.620 - 27:56.900:  depressing. I created him to make myself and also my readers feel better. He's positive,
27:56.900 - 28:02.860:  codly and nice, and he's helping people find hope and light inside themselves.
28:02.860 - 28:08.880:  Injure the cat's accounts on social media offer advice on issues raging from fund raising
28:08.880 - 28:16.380:  to burnout. One post says everyone should be like a cat, because cats waste no effort,
28:16.860 - 28:23.060:  but are determined in achieving their goals. That report by Vitaly Shchefchenko.
28:26.200 - 28:30.720:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
28:30.940 - 28:34.600:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered, you can send us an email.
28:34.600 - 28:41.960:  The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll.
28:42.140 - 28:47.700:  The producer was Alison Davies. The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Janet Jalil. Until next time, goodbye.
