00:36.820 - 00:39.760:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:42.500 - 00:48.680:  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 4th of August, these are our main stories.
00:49.200 - 00:53.320:  A European study has found that the temperature of the world's oceans has reached its
00:53.320 - 00:59.080:  highest recorded level. India's top court suspends the conviction of the opposition leader Rahul
00:59.080 - 01:04.060:  Gandhi in a defamation case, allowing him to contest national elections next year.
01:07.460 - 01:12.040:  Also in this podcast the Commonwealth Games suffers another blow as a Canadian province
01:12.040 - 01:16.560:  cancels a bid to host it weeks after Australia pulled out. And
01:19.800 - 01:24.320:  the would-be rapper who's pleaded guilty to laundering billions of dollars of bitcoin.
01:29.060 - 01:33.860:  The oceans have reached their hottest ever recorded temperature, another sign of the
01:33.860 - 01:39.220:  accelerating effects of climate change. The average daily global sea surface temperature was
01:39.220 - 01:45.060:  a whisker under 21 degrees Celsius this week, according to the EU's climate change service
01:45.060 - 01:50.880:  Copernicus. That's far above the average for this time of year, which is about 16 degrees Celsius.
01:51.740 - 01:58.100:  Temperatures have been slowly increasing for decades. Dr Samantha Burgess from Copernicus says it's
01:58.100 - 02:04.140:  a dangerous long-term trend. It's quite worrying. Sea temperature is hugely important in
02:04.140 - 02:08.960:  regulating biological processes. It helps species grow, develop, especially a lot of marine creatures
02:08.960 - 02:13.580:  can't regulate their own temperature, so they rely on the water temperature around them.
02:14.060 - 02:20.300:  And we're seeing changes already in terms of species distributions, prevalence of harmful
02:20.300 - 02:26.200:  algal blooms popping up maybe where we wouldn't necessarily expect them. And this species shifting
02:26.200 - 02:32.240:  from sort of warmer southern locations up into the colder regions as well.
02:33.300 - 02:37.460:  Professor Helen Findley is a UK-based biological oceanographer.
02:37.980 - 02:42.940:  This is yet another alarm bell showing that the climate crisis isn't a future problem.
02:43.000 - 02:48.800:  It's a problem that's here with us right now. For me, we have the the commitments on paper,
02:48.800 - 02:54.480:  the governments have agreed to for the Paris agreement. We really need to see much more ambitious
02:54.480 - 03:00.440:  action to get to net zero as quickly as possible. The sooner we stabilize, the emissions going
03:00.440 - 03:05.860:  into our atmosphere. The sooner our planet's temperature will stabilize both on land in the air,
03:05.860 - 03:11.120:  in the atmosphere and in the ocean. Our environment editor Justin Rolatt told us more.
03:11.860 - 03:15.820:  We've had the hottest month there, but also it's not surprising, I suppose, that the sea is heating
03:15.820 - 03:21.720:  up as well. The sea takes up extra heat in the earth's atmosphere as a result of climate change.
03:21.720 - 03:27.500:  The seas take up about 90% of that heat. The seas are slowly warming up, and if you think about
03:27.500 - 03:32.420:  this huge body of water, you know when you have a hot drink, a cup of tea or something. How long
03:32.420 - 03:38.360:  that stays warm? It's the same with the sea. It takes a long time to heat up, but then radiates
03:38.360 - 03:44.940:  heat back into the atmosphere. So it really is kind of like an indicator of the ever-increasing
03:44.940 - 03:49.380:  temperatures on earth. And so something that we really should be quite concerned about.
03:49.560 - 03:53.960:  And direct consequences, obviously, for sea life. What will tell us a bit more about them?
03:54.220 - 03:58.720:  Well, there are two big issues. One is sea life and the other is the ocean currents and weather.
03:58.840 - 04:02.700:  So let's talk about sea life first. And that's something that the Marine Biological Association
04:02.820 - 04:07.440:  has been looking at for years. It's been looking at the population of plankton in the sea.
04:07.780 - 04:12.720:  For more than 90 years, it's been trawling the seas, collecting plankton and looking at the
04:12.720 - 04:18.000:  distribution of population. And plankton has plants as well as animals. In fact, 50% of all the
04:18.000 - 04:25.720:  oxygen in the atmosphere, every other you breath you take is from oxygen produced by plant plankton.
04:26.640 - 04:32.120:  So these are really important for the global ecosystem. Sensitive to different species are
04:32.120 - 04:37.220:  sensitive to heat. There are some indications that smaller plant species are doing better than
04:37.280 - 04:42.860:  the larger ones. So that's kind of a worry. And also there's been a migration of species north.
04:42.860 - 04:48.040:  So there are kind of, you know, quite dramatic effects. That's the kind of foundation of the marine
04:48.040 - 04:53.500:  food chain because most animals either eat plankton or eat animals that eat plankton, if you
04:53.500 - 04:59.980:  see what I mean. So it's absolutely a really important part of the systems that help us survive
04:59.980 - 05:06.720:  on earth. Our climate editor, Justin Roland. It was a disqualification that threatened to neuter one
05:06.720 - 05:11.920:  of the few opposition figures that has the kind of name recognition to challenge India's prime
05:11.920 - 05:17.100:  minister Narendra Modi. Earlier this year, Rahul Gandhi, from a powerful political family that
05:17.100 - 05:22.800:  has given India three prime ministers in the past, was sentenced to two years in jail after being
05:22.800 - 05:28.800:  found guilty in a defamation case. That led to him being turfed out of parliament. Now India
05:28.800 - 05:34.160:  Supreme Court has suspended his conviction, paving the way for him to return to parliament and
05:34.160 - 05:40.840:  contest general elections next year. At a time of rising violence against minorities, particularly
05:40.840 - 05:47.620:  Muslims, Mr. Gandhi said he remained committed to protecting the idea of India. This was his reaction
05:47.620 - 05:58.740:  after the court judgment. My path is clear. I am clear in my mind what I have to do and what
05:58.740 - 06:04.600:  is my work. I thank the people who helped us. I also thank the people for their love and support.
06:05.480 - 06:08.740:  Our South Asia regional editor, Ambrassaneti Rajan, told us more.
06:09.180 - 06:14.760:  So Rahul Gandhi belongs to India's most influential political dynasty. And during an election speech
06:14.760 - 06:21.500:  in 2019, he was mentioning the surname of the prime minister Narendra Modi. He was talking about
06:21.500 - 06:27.540:  how come some of the thieves have the surname of Modi. He was referring to some people accused
06:27.660 - 06:34.220:  of the similar surnames of financial crimes. And then a member of the governing Hindu
06:34.220 - 06:39.780:  nationalist BJP went to court and then said he had defamed the entire community. We are talking
06:39.780 - 06:44.740:  about millions of people. That was his argument that he should be punished. And Mr. Gandhi refused
06:44.740 - 06:51.080:  to apologize and court in March this year a local court in the state of Gujarat from where Mr. Modi
06:51.080 - 06:59.720:  comes from. And the court found him guilty and then he gave him two-year sentencing by Indian
06:59.720 - 07:04.240:  Parliament law. If you are punished for two years, if you get a sentencing, then you are automatically
07:04.240 - 07:10.040:  you are disqualified as an MP. So this triggered a huge political storm in India at that time.
07:10.640 - 07:16.460:  And later on the case went up to the high court and there again Mr. Gandhi's appeal was rejected.
07:17.000 - 07:22.340:  And now the Supreme Court has suspended that conviction. First that means it is a huge relief for
07:22.340 - 07:28.360:  Mr. Gandhi. Now does this enable him to go back to Parliament if the Parliament reverses the
07:28.360 - 07:34.080:  order of disqualifying him? Second that also allows him to run in the next year's election because
07:34.080 - 07:40.080:  this is one of the keenly anticipated elections. And Mr. Gandhi is a possible prime minister
07:40.540 - 07:46.400:  contender. So it is also important for Mr. Gandhi to go back to the election scene and also to
07:46.400 - 07:53.840:  Parliament to raise key issues. This all comes as critics of Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist government say
07:53.840 - 07:59.600:  that it's using the judicial system to silence opposition figures to try to muzzle institutions
07:59.600 - 08:06.060:  that criticise it. But there have been criticism about the way the some of the judgments were given
08:06.060 - 08:11.520:  in recent years and many critics they say that the judgments went in favour of the government.
08:12.460 - 08:18.300:  But especially with regard to many of the opposition claims. But with regard to this judgment the
08:18.300 - 08:24.740:  Supreme Court judge very clearly stated that the lower court did not give valid reasons for
08:24.740 - 08:29.600:  this particular judgment. And they should have been more elaborate. But at the same time the court
08:29.600 - 08:34.840:  also said Mr. Gandhi should have been very careful about talking. It was in bad days while
08:34.840 - 08:40.840:  talking about some community. But then this whole issue of how this is what Mr. Gandhi's argument
08:40.840 - 08:46.180:  that India's institutions like the Supreme Court had been captured by the right wing Hindu
08:46.180 - 08:52.420:  fundamentalists. And that is why you see that in a how this kind of impact in various institutions.
08:52.420 - 08:57.480:  For example, India's investigative agencies are being used against opposition parties in investigation
08:57.540 - 09:02.780:  and they are being targeted. Of course the government rejects its arguments. The government also
09:02.780 - 09:06.520:  maintains that India is a very robust and independent judiciary.
09:09.520 - 09:14.700:  I write this as a hostage. The words of the President of Niger at the start of an article written
09:14.700 - 09:20.120:  in Friday's Washington Post in which he warns that the recent military coup could have devastating
09:20.120 - 09:26.120:  consequences not just for his country but for the world. President Mohammed Bazoum who has been
09:26.120 - 09:31.680:  held by the military in Niger since July the 26th also calls on the US and the international
09:31.680 - 09:37.320:  community to help restore his country's constitutional order. My colleague Andrew Peach
09:37.320 - 09:43.100:  spoke to Niger's ambassador to Washington, Hari Lehman Singh, about his President's article
09:43.100 - 09:49.800:  in the Washington Post. It's very powerful really. I think it makes history. He makes really the
09:49.800 - 09:56.760:  case on what is actually at stake in Niger. He made very clear that if in Niger falls, yes,
09:57.200 - 10:03.460:  it will be a disaster for the Nigerian people but definitely it will also mean that Wagner will
10:03.460 - 10:09.920:  take over the whole Sahel and the jihadists will have room to establish a sanctuary for themselves.
10:09.920 - 10:15.200:  So they will have an access to the sea and to the north. Don't forget that we have a border
10:15.200 - 10:22.820:  with Libya and Libya has is on the Mediterranean Sea. You open a route that nobody is controlling.
10:22.820 - 10:30.380:  That will be a threat, a global threat, not any more regional or national issue. So I think he made
10:30.380 - 10:38.940:  it very clear that what is at stake is at three levels for us, for the region and for the world.
10:39.100 - 10:44.860:  Do you think it's remotely realistic that the call for help from the United States, particularly
10:45.540 - 10:49.280:  from President Bazoum will be heated in some way? What do you think the US could do?
10:49.460 - 10:55.980:  The US has already done a lot. The President Biden issued a statement, a public statement
10:55.980 - 11:02.200:  calling for immediate release of President Bazoum and the restoration of democracy. The US
11:02.200 - 11:08.840:  has been consistent in keeping saying that nothing is acceptable less than stopping this attempt
11:08.840 - 11:15.380:  and restoring immediately the legal, legally established institution President Bazoum.
11:15.980 - 11:22.560:  Do you think the US will go beyond warm words? I don't think they have said such a tough word
11:22.560 - 11:30.300:  of condemnation and such a tough word of calling to restore situation for a while in a situation
11:30.300 - 11:36.560:  like this in Africa. This situation is unique. And if Mohammad Bazoum's government has effectively
11:36.560 - 11:41.720:  restored by the West with the support of the West, would that be accepted by people in Niger?
11:42.040 - 11:46.780:  Of course, the people of Niger have elected President Bazoum. He didn't come by
11:46.780 - 11:52.460:  a coup. He has been elected. Niger's ambassador to Washington, Kiari Limand in Guiri,
11:52.460 - 11:57.300:  speaking to the BBC. And since that interview was recorded, a West African delegation,
11:57.300 - 12:03.260:  which was supposed to be mediating in Niger, has left after just a few hours without any
12:03.260 - 12:08.760:  sign of progress. The negotiators appointed by the regional body ECOWAS didn't meet the
12:08.760 - 12:14.160:  coup leader or the deposed President. ECOWAS has imposed sanctions on Niger and has threatened
12:14.160 - 12:23.120:  to use force if Mohammad Bazoum is not reinstated. The Islamic State militant group has announced
12:23.120 - 12:27.660:  a new leader, apparently providing his nom de guerre rather than his true identity.
12:28.220 - 12:32.680:  It made the announcement in an audio message as it confirmed the killing of its former leader
12:32.680 - 12:37.240:  in northern Syria earlier this year. He's our Middle East correspondent, Yolanda Nell.
12:37.940 - 12:42.340:  Islamic State is now a shadow of the militant organization that once ruled a third of Iraq
12:42.340 - 12:47.920:  and Syria. But its latest announcement on social media is a reminder that it continues to regroup
12:47.920 - 12:53.180:  and poses a lingering threat. No details were given by IS about its new leader,
12:53.180 - 12:59.280:  named as Abu Hathas al-Hashami al-Qarashi, but he's said to have replaced Abu Hussein al-Hassani al-Qarashi
12:59.280 - 13:04.220:  who's not thought to have been related. Back in April, Turkey claimed that its intelligence
13:04.220 - 13:09.940:  forces had killed the former head of IS. However, in its new audio message, IS disputes that
13:09.940 - 13:14.820:  account. Instead, it appears to suggest that its leader was killed following fighting with its
13:14.820 - 13:20.600:  militant rivals Hayat Takhriyar Hashem during fighting in Idlib in northern Syria with his body
13:20.600 - 13:26.520:  then handed over to the Turks. Yolanda Nell. Andrew Tate is the controversial social media
13:26.520 - 13:32.120:  influencer who gained notoriety for videos aimed at young men which were hugely misogynistic.
13:32.120 - 13:38.040:  They were viewed millions of times. Now an appeals court in Romania has lifted the house arrest
13:38.040 - 13:43.920:  imposed on him. He and his brother face rape and human trafficking charges. They are accused
13:43.920 - 13:49.260:  of sexually exploiting women after leering them with false promises of love and marriage,
13:49.800 - 13:55.940:  allegations which they deny. This is what Andrew Tate had to say after his house arrest was lifted.
13:56.620 - 14:00.780:  In January when I was thrown in a jail cell, the media reported and told the world I was a
14:00.780 - 14:05.700:  terrible person. They said that I hurt people and I make a lot of money from criminal enterprise and
14:05.700 - 14:09.160:  here we stand seven or eight months later and I've not seen a single victim on the news. I don't
14:09.160 - 14:13.020:  know if you have. I've done nothing wrong. God knows I've done nothing wrong in my heart. I know
14:13.020 - 14:16.100:  I've done nothing wrong. I think the people at home who are the functioning brain understand
14:16.100 - 14:19.900:  we've done nothing wrong. Once again, absolute respect to the judge, respect to Romania,
14:19.900 - 14:23.800:  respect to the remaining judicial system I look forward to be completely exonerated in due time.
14:25.040 - 14:29.120:  Our European passport must tell us more about the charges against Andrew Tate.
14:29.480 - 14:34.460:  Very serious offences indeed. He's accused of it's alleged first of all rape was one of the
14:34.460 - 14:40.460:  accusations. He's charged along with his brother and two other women with forming a criminal gang
14:40.460 - 14:47.380:  and also with human trafficking and the specific details of the allegations are that women were
14:47.380 - 14:53.540:  lured to this residence in Romania, romantically lured, promised a relationship with him. He does
14:53.540 - 14:58.600:  in his videos recommends seduction as a technique and how to go about it. But what they alleged is
14:58.600 - 15:05.020:  that after this the women were held captive and forced to appear in pornographic videos which
15:05.020 - 15:09.800:  were then shown on the internet. Mr Tate, as we've seen, denies all those allegations.
15:09.900 - 15:15.420:  What changes today is that he is under what they call in Romania as we heard judicial control.
15:15.420 - 15:19.440:  That means he's no longer under house to arrest. He can come and go as he pleases.
15:19.820 - 15:24.440:  But he's not allowed to leave Romania. In fact, he's not allowed to leave Bucharest, the city he's in
15:24.440 - 15:29.660:  at all. Very importantly, he's not allowed to contact any of the victims or ledge victims
15:30.100 - 15:32.420:  in this case who've made the allegations against him.
15:37.100 - 15:41.520:  Still to come in his podcast, thousands of items that belonged to Queen's lead singer,
15:41.520 - 15:45.640:  Freddie Mercury, go on display before being auctioned in London.
15:52.660 - 15:56.060:  From the passion of the fans. Yes, what did you think of the match, though?
15:56.060 - 16:00.020:  The match was amazing. It was so nice to see so many Nigerians coming up.
16:00.020 - 16:05.420:  To the atmosphere of the competition. The game, the crowd, the atmosphere was absolutely amazing.
16:05.420 - 16:07.660:  I am now a converted New Zealand fan.
16:07.860 - 16:12.160:  World Football at the Women's World Cup is the podcast from the BBC World Service,
16:12.160 - 16:16.200:  capturing all the excitement of the tournament here in Australia and New Zealand.
16:16.700 - 16:21.040:  Listen now by searching for World Football wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
16:24.460 - 16:28.720:  Welcome back to the Global News podcast. In the latest blow to the Commonwealth Games,
16:28.720 - 16:34.740:  the government of the Canadian province of Alberta has pulled out of a bid to host the 2030 games.
16:35.360 - 16:39.740:  It said the estimated bill of $2 billion was too high.
16:40.560 - 16:45.620:  Last month, the Australian state of Victoria abruptly withdrew as hosts for the next games due to
16:45.620 - 16:52.180:  be held in 2026 because of mounting costs. Our sports news correspondent Alex Kapstick told us more.
16:52.860 - 16:58.520:  As we heard a few weeks ago, when Victoria pulled out of hosting the next Commonwealth Games in
16:58.520 - 17:04.920:  2026 because it was too expensive. There was speculation then about the viability of the future
17:04.920 - 17:10.500:  of the Commonwealth Games. It happened in Alberta. The Canadian province was looking at a potential bid
17:10.500 - 17:16.280:  for 2030. There was a feasibility study. After this, they announced, just like in Australia,
17:16.820 - 17:21.700:  that they could not justify the cost. It was too expensive. At the moment, there was no bid
17:22.260 - 17:28.520:  in the 2030, therefore no host. There was no host or bid in the 2026. You could say,
17:28.540 - 17:33.160:  with some justification, that the Commonwealth Games Federation is in a bit of a crisis.
17:33.560 - 17:37.920:  But why are these games turning out to be so expensive? Are they more expensive than they have
17:37.920 - 17:44.700:  been in previous years? The global economy is as strong as it has been. People are looking at costs
17:44.700 - 17:50.060:  and certainly it's not just the Commonwealth Games. The Olympics had similar problems in
17:50.060 - 17:57.340:  encouraging host cities to bid because it had become such an expensive enterprise. Sochi in 2014,
17:57.340 - 18:04.700:  the Russian Olympics cost northwards of $50 billion. That frightened everybody. Even Paris,
18:04.700 - 18:09.520:  which was comparatively cheap for the Olympics, next year, Paris 2024, costs have risen there
18:09.520 - 18:14.960:  to more than $8 billion when it was supposed to be much cheaper than that. The Commonwealth Games
18:15.020 - 18:22.780:  is a major global event, but it's not one that certainly athletes consider to be the pinnacle
18:22.820 - 18:28.840:  of their career. So what often happens is that some of the elite athletes don't actually bother
18:28.840 - 18:32.160:  taking part in the Commonwealth Games. They save themselves for world championships and they're
18:32.620 - 18:38.040:  really getting ready for the Olympics. Their focus is the Olympic cycle. So there is a bit of that
18:38.040 - 18:42.380:  involved. And I think cities have looked at it and decided it's not for them. Why should they be
18:42.380 - 18:48.980:  spending $5, $10 billion or whatever it costs to stage a multi-sports event that a lot of people
18:48.980 - 18:53.700:  aren't really too bothered about? But a big blow for those athletes that have spent years preparing
18:53.700 - 18:58.040:  for events like the Commonwealth Games. It's a blow to athletes, I think, from certainly from
18:58.040 - 19:02.160:  the smaller nations and territories that don't normally get an opportunity, a chance to appear
19:02.800 - 19:08.180:  in such a big, multi-sports event. I've been to a few hours in Birmingham last year, which was
19:08.180 - 19:13.940:  a big, big success. And a lot of the attention was on those athletes from Vanatu, from the Gerns,
19:13.940 - 19:17.180:  the Arles, you know, from the Falken Islands. Play places like that, the Arle of Manwear. They
19:17.180 - 19:21.140:  don't get an opportunity. This is a live-channel opportunity for them to appear on the global stage.
19:21.140 - 19:26.380:  So yes, a big blow for them. For the elite athletes, their focus is always the world championships,
19:26.380 - 19:32.140:  and ultimately the Olympics. The Commonwealth Games is a nice to have, if you like. If they were
19:32.140 - 19:37.060:  forced to choose, they would choose the worlds in their sport or the Olympics. Alex Kapstik.
19:37.660 - 19:41.540:  A husband and wife, who've been described as the Bonnie and Clyde of the crypto age,
19:41.540 - 19:46.440:  have pleaded guilty to trying to launder four and a half billion dollars of Bitcoin.
19:46.440 - 19:50.120:  The cryptocurrency was stolen in a hack more than seven years ago.
19:50.740 - 19:55.660:  Ilya Lichtenstein, a Russian-born entrepreneur, and Heather Morgan, an aspiring rapper,
19:55.660 - 20:01.960:  known by the alias Razzle Khan, had flaunted their wealth online before being arrested last year.
20:02.440 - 20:05.660:  This report from our cyber correspondent, Joe Tidey.
20:09.500 - 20:15.260:  Most criminals like to keep a low profile, not Heather Morgan, aka Razzle Khan.
20:15.680 - 20:18.700:  When she wasn't laundering a stash of billions in stolen Bitcoin,
20:18.700 - 20:23.540:  Morgan was on a mission to become famous for rapping. She posted dozens of
20:23.540 - 20:29.280:  expletive filled, often psychedelic music videos on YouTube and TikTok, and even after her
20:29.280 - 20:34.520:  arrest last year, kept them online for the world to see. She also wrote columns pretending to be
20:34.520 - 20:39.260:  a successful tech entrepreneur and investor. If you're interested in what I say, recorded
20:39.260 - 20:45.300:  the first time, because I'm not a little wind up dancing monkey. Her husband, Ilya Lichtenstein,
20:45.300 - 20:50.080:  was less keen on the limelight. The softly spoken computer programmer would appear in her videos,
20:50.080 - 20:55.840:  seemingly reluctantly. Court documents suggest he was the mastermind behind the couple's operation.
20:56.240 - 21:00.140:  When police raided their Manhattan apartment, they found hollied out books in his office to
21:00.140 - 21:06.640:  conceal phones, dozens of handsets, USBs, and wads of cash. They also discovered his spreadsheet,
21:06.640 - 21:11.760:  meticulously detailing their methods for laundering the stash. Lisa Monaco from the Department of Justice
21:11.760 - 21:15.200:  celebrated the recovery of the funds in a statement when it was announced.
21:15.200 - 21:21.840:  This is the largest seizure of cryptocurrency ever by U.S. law enforcement. It is also the
21:21.840 - 21:28.080:  department's largest single financial seizure in its history. The message to criminals is clear.
21:28.420 - 21:34.580:  cryptocurrency is not a safe haven. The case dates back to 2016, when an unknown hacker,
21:34.580 - 21:41.640:  who we now know was Lichtenstein, moved nearly 120,000 bitcoins out of the BitFinex crypto exchange
21:41.640 - 21:47.360:  to their own digital wallet. Nearly a year later, Lichtenstein and Morgan began trying to
21:47.360 - 21:52.440:  launder the Bitcoin into traditional money. They used all the tricks in the book to try and hide
21:52.440 - 21:58.000:  their tracks, including sending small sums of Bitcoin to thousands of different crypto wallets owned
21:58.000 - 22:04.100:  by fake identities. They mixed it through criminal, dark net marketplaces and set up shell companies
22:04.100 - 22:09.580:  to make the funds look legitimate. Police followed years of transactions on Bitcoin's public ledger,
22:09.900 - 22:14.820:  as the couple cashed out millions of dollars. One of their key mistakes was buying supermarket
22:14.820 - 22:19.660:  vouchers with the stolen funds. Here's Jonathan Levin from crypto investigators,
22:20.220 - 22:28.540:  Chain Alasis. Heather had actually used a Walmart gift card that they could link back to some of the
22:28.540 - 22:35.360:  proceeds of the BitFinex hack, which then opened up the search warrant and the further investigation.
22:35.720 - 22:42.240:  And so really gift cards moving between different exchanges, moving across different cryptocurrency
22:42.240 - 22:51.580:  assets, that never actually created the sort of break in provenance that was intended to happen
22:51.580 - 22:54.460:  when you are trying to launder that amount of money.
22:59.440 - 23:03.720:  The case is the latest in a string of high profile successes for police around the world,
23:03.720 - 23:08.180:  who've become adept at following trails left by criminals using Bitcoin.
23:08.780 - 23:12.980:  Police say Morgan and Lichtenstein were planning to flee the U.S. to Russia,
23:13.540 - 23:18.520:  Lichtenstein's country of birth. If successful, they would have likely lived a billionaire lifestyle
23:19.120 - 23:20.740:  safe from arrest by the U.S.
23:24.880 - 23:26.600:  Instead, they now face prison.
23:31.980 - 23:36.900:  That report by Joe Tidey. Donald Trump's mounting legal troubles. He's been
23:36.900 - 23:42.860:  indicted three times in the past four months, have not dented his status as a clear frontrunner
23:42.860 - 23:48.940:  for the Republican presidential nomination. Latest poll suggests he has a lead of 37 points
23:48.940 - 23:54.280:  over his nearest rival, Florida Governor, Rhonda Santis. On Thursday, in a Washington court,
23:54.280 - 23:59.040:  he faced charges that he'd conspired to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
23:59.680 - 24:04.640:  He pleaded not guilty. John Fredericks is a radio talk show host with a nationwide show,
24:04.960 - 24:10.360:  who was also chairman of the Trump campaign in the state of Virginia in 2016 and 2020.
24:35.720 - 24:41.600:  And I ask a simple question. If you're a rain convicted and sentenced to jail,
24:42.220 - 24:48.480:  will you run for president? And he said unequivocally, yes, I'll run and I'll win.
24:49.380 - 24:57.060:  And here's why Trump's poll numbers keep going up in the face of these vacuous, insane,
24:57.760 - 25:05.620:  assinine indictments and arrangements. You cannot indict a movement.
25:06.040 - 25:13.280:  This is the greatest populist political movement in the history of the American Republic
25:13.880 - 25:19.880:  as we know it. But what about across the nation? Polls show that Donald Trump is pretty much on
25:19.880 - 25:26.080:  level pegging with his main rival, the Democratic president Joe Biden. So is Mr. Trump's confidence
25:26.080 - 25:31.600:  well-paced? We know Shah doesn't think so. She's a political strategist and former senior
25:31.600 - 25:36.360:  staffer to two Republican congressmen. I don't think Donald Trump can make a passage
25:36.360 - 25:41.680:  on her election. Though he may win the Republican nomination, I just don't think the American
25:41.680 - 25:47.260:  electorate wants a president that lost in 2020. You know, we Americans are interesting when it comes
25:47.260 - 25:53.920:  to our politics and how we see people who can't, you know, essentially lose one time and try to
25:53.920 - 25:59.080:  stand for yet another. This is the kind of feat in which you don't get another bite at the apple.
25:59.640 - 26:03.880:  And I think in general, when you look at these indictments that have rained down on President
26:03.880 - 26:10.080:  Trump this year, you see a great many moderate, center right, independently minded folks say,
26:10.080 - 26:16.200:  this is just not good leadership. If he's got all these legal problems, how's he at all going
26:16.200 - 26:20.920:  to be freed up to lead the country? We are living with great problems right now within the United
26:20.920 - 26:26.700:  States. Of course, we talk about the economy, crime, public safety, and let's not forget the
26:26.700 - 26:32.100:  extreme weather we've been experiencing this summer. Coast to coast. But none of this gets talked
26:32.100 - 26:38.360:  about every day. It seems as if the highest level Republicans have to essentially fend off another
26:38.360 - 26:44.180:  attack against their former president, Donald Trump. And it makes it very hard to do the work of
26:44.180 - 26:47.340:  the American people when you're in a none dated with legal woes.
26:48.040 - 26:53.120:  Renashar, and before her, John Fredericks. In the past, when Ukraine has carried out attacks on
26:53.120 - 26:57.380:  Russian targets, it's been quite about claiming responsibility. But is that changing?
26:58.000 - 27:03.260:  Ukrainian sources say an unmanned seedrone loaded with explosives was rammed into a Russian
27:03.260 - 27:09.380:  navy ship causing substantial damage. They published a video supposedly showing a direct hit on
27:09.380 - 27:14.780:  the ship's hull, but that has not been verified. The reported assault is near the Russian port of
27:14.780 - 27:19.680:  Novorossisk. Russian officials say that they've successfully repelled a drone attack there.
27:20.160 - 27:24.400:  I asked our correspondent, James Waterhouse in Kiev, what was known about this attack?
27:25.060 - 27:30.420:  I think it's fair to say that there was an attack, as you say. The Russian officials in Novorossisk
27:30.680 - 27:36.020:  made the claim early this morning that they had successfully repelled it. The telegram app was a
27:36.020 - 27:41.880:  wash with unverified footage of Russian ships opening fire on drones. But then sources at Ukraine's
27:41.880 - 27:46.520:  security service have told the BBC that they were successful in that they successfully damaged
27:47.300 - 27:52.360:  a major landing vessel, and we've seen footage of it appearing to be tilting,
27:52.360 - 27:59.880:  listing to one side in the port itself. I think there is a partial coinness from Ukraine to admit
27:59.880 - 28:04.260:  to attacks like these. I think certainly with these apparent use of seedrones, we're told
28:04.260 - 28:09.180:  around 450 kilos of TNT were used in this apparent attack. When we're talking about
28:09.180 - 28:15.020:  marine attacks like this and the seabirds of the Black Sea or around Crimea, Ukraine is keen to
28:15.380 - 28:20.780:  at least informally acknowledge some kind of responsibility. The same can't be said for the
28:20.780 - 28:26.320:  increased in drone attacks we're seeing deep inside Russia. Novorossisk is a major terminal for
28:26.320 - 28:31.800:  Russia. 1.8 million tons of oil make it out there every day. It's an important naval base. I
28:31.800 - 28:36.440:  think the reasons for Kiev targeting it are obvious, not least in a fortnight where its own
28:36.440 - 28:42.480:  ports have been pummeled by Russian drones. How are the Russians responding to this? On a
28:42.480 - 28:47.820:  local official level, you will just hear that everything is fine and it was successfully repelled.
28:47.820 - 28:53.120:  That is par for the course, but I think it's hard to make the attribution from attacks like this
28:53.120 - 28:58.740:  between what response may happen because we see strikes from the air routinely. We see drone
28:58.740 - 29:04.680:  and missile attacks and you can make whatever link you will. Russia is unrelenting in that tactic.
29:05.320 - 29:09.720:  But it's interesting. Kiev clearly wants to relay this message. It's repeating it to this
29:09.720 - 29:14.240:  mantra that the war is coming to Russia. It's looking to turn on the pressure. Attacks like this
29:14.240 - 29:18.640:  help with that endeavor. But President Zelensky is also saying that he could see a peace summit
29:18.640 - 29:23.880:  taking place as soon as the autumn. But it looks like neither side is exactly preparing the
29:23.880 - 29:29.380:  conditions, shall we say. James Waterhouse. Thousands of personal items that belong to the former
29:29.380 - 29:33.980:  lead singer of Queen, Freddie Mercury, have gone on public display at Sotheby's in London.
29:34.600 - 29:40.220:  Among them are handwritten song lyrics, his flamboyant costumes, and the baby grand piano he
29:40.220 - 29:45.200:  used to compose some of the band's greatest hits. The entire collection will go under the hammer
29:45.200 - 29:50.080:  on September the 5th. Our art correspondent David Slittle has been to see them.
29:50.440 - 29:57.060:  The famous graffiti green door that led to Freddie's garden. Freddie's record collection.
29:58.140 - 30:04.480:  Freddie's kitchen. Freddie's costumes. There's even Freddie's moustache comb.
30:06.720 - 30:15.000:  There are 30,000 objects. And for a man who is very private really, this is more than just a
30:15.000 - 30:20.400:  collection of stuff. It tells a story. The life of Freddie Mercury.
30:24.080 - 30:31.560:  And for fans of classics like Bohemian Rhapsody, there are on display little clues to how he created his
30:31.560 - 30:39.960:  songs. What am I looking at here? Well, we're looking at here that this is the earliest surviving
30:39.960 - 30:50.060:  draft for Bohemian Rhapsody. Yes, it's the lyric sheet of Bohemian Rhapsody which began with
30:50.620 - 30:56.220:  it appears another name. There's a title. Yes, yes, but then if you look underneath,
30:56.220 - 31:03.760:  there is a cancelled earlier title where he had written Mongolian Rhapsody. So Bohemian Rhapsody
31:03.760 - 31:06.580:  was originally Mongolian Rhapsody. So it seems, yeah.
31:08.540 - 31:15.160:  And if you love the Bohemian Rhapsody video, that snake bracelet and the outfits are both up for sale.
31:22.160 - 31:27.460:  And what about those parties? They invited one regular visitor to garden launch,
31:28.320 - 31:35.360:  songwriter Tim Rice to have a final look at the Freddie Dining. I'm hearing you dined here a few times
31:35.360 - 31:43.060:  then. Certainly went to a few parties. You did dine here once or twice. Do you know what you were
31:43.060 - 31:49.100:  doing on the 14th of June 1987? No, let me go on. I've got something here for you.
31:50.560 - 31:58.540:  Freddie UC was very organized and there is a book with a record of every dinner party. Oh, wow.
32:00.600 - 32:05.780:  Good heavens. So you were having cold tomato soup, lamb in puff pastry,
32:05.780 - 32:11.540:  you potatoes, carrots, salad, and there are the nice white shatter lefty pop. And a red
32:11.540 - 32:18.180:  Volney. Wow, just four of us around that magnificent table. Wow. I mean, I remember the evening,
32:19.640 - 32:25.520:  he was very civilized and if we didn't know he was a mega rock star, you might not know that.
32:26.700 - 32:32.600:  I mean, he was the opposite a lot of the time from the image he had on stage.
32:33.980 - 32:40.480:  So there it is, a free exhibition of a lifetime of memories that will in a few weeks be sold off
32:40.740 - 32:48.740:  in six Freddie sales. This is a once only moment they are expecting quite a few visitors.
32:51.600 - 32:56.120:  Sure they are. That was David's little reporting on the Freddie Mercury exhibition
32:56.240 - 32:59.940:  a world of his own at Sotheby's here in London.
33:03.720 - 33:08.500:  And that's all from us for now or nearly all because before we go here's Jackie with news of
33:08.500 - 33:14.660:  this week's happy pod. Yes, in this edition smashing the record for climbing the world's 14 highest
33:14.660 - 33:20.960:  super peaks in just 92 days. We've got an interview with Felix Cleaser, the remarkable musician who
33:20.960 - 33:26.120:  plays the French horn with his toes and who has just made his BBC prom's debut. We've got more
33:26.120 - 33:31.640:  music from Shavorn Brady, the Irish harpist who performed a concert on top of Mount Kilimanjaro
33:31.640 - 33:38.780:  in Tanzania, the new plastic that decomposes like fruit, an eight-year-old chess prodigy from Nigeria
33:38.780 - 33:44.480:  sharing her passion for the game, and on a similar theme, what is it about sport that moves us?
33:45.220 - 33:48.480:  All in the happy pod available from Saturday, August the 5th.
