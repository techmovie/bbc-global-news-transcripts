00:16.020 - 00:20.020:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
00:20.160 - 00:25.920:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
00:25.920 - 00:30.340:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
00:30.480 - 00:35.260:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad gal as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos
00:35.260 - 00:39.600:  really did to become the first person in history to pocket a hundred billion dollars,
00:39.600 - 00:45.020:  listen to Good Bad Billionaire with me Simon Jack, and me Zingsing, available now wherever you
00:45.020 - 00:52.220:  get your podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:54.280 - 00:56.720:  I'm Gareth Barlow, and in the early hours of Wednesday,
00:56.720 - 01:03.300:  30 August, these are our main stories. The Russian mercenary boss Yavgene Pregogin has been buried
01:03.300 - 01:09.040:  during a private ceremony in St. Petersburg. The US state of Florida braces for the arrival of
01:09.040 - 01:14.680:  Hurricane Adalio, which is being described as a potential once in a lifetime event. And the authorities
01:14.680 - 01:21.800:  in Nigeria arrest dozens of men under anti-LGBT laws. Also in this podcast,
01:21.800 - 01:37.520:  why a watermark might help us determine between AI and authentic art. And could a bit of
01:37.520 - 01:48.660:  Mozart help reduce pain in babies? We go first to St. Petersburg, where a week after he and
01:48.660 - 01:54.780:  nine others died in a plane crash. The Wagner-Mercery chief Yavgene Pregogin has been buried in a private
01:54.780 - 02:01.700:  funeral. The man who was once a key ally of Vladimir Putin had also become a vocal critic and
02:01.700 - 02:07.760:  dared to challenge the Kremlin. His demise after launching a brief mutiny was swift. Our
02:07.760 - 02:11.160:  Russian editor Steve Rosenberg has been to the site where he was buried.
02:11.700 - 02:16.320:  I'm standing outside a cemetery on the edge of St. Petersburg. There is heavy security here,
02:16.740 - 02:22.220:  police all along the perimeter and inside the cemetery itself, which means we can't go in.
02:22.900 - 02:28.540:  Earlier today Yavgene Pregogin was buried here. I can just about see his grave from where I'm standing.
02:28.540 - 02:34.500:  There's a Russian trickler flying from it and the flag of Wagner. There will be no warning,
02:34.500 - 02:39.640:  no official announcement about what time and where Mr. Pregogin's funeral would take place.
02:40.000 - 02:44.880:  Clearly the intention, either on the part of his family, or what is left of the Wagner-Mercery
02:44.880 - 02:51.320:  or on the part of the authorities, was to keep things very low-key. All day St. Petersburg
02:51.320 - 02:57.020:  had been buzzing with rumors and speculation about where the Mercery chief would be laid to rest
02:57.020 - 03:01.760:  with at least four different cemeteries named. Two months ago Yavgene Pregogin and his
03:01.760 - 03:07.240:  Wagner fighters launched an insurrection. It was over in a day, but it had been a direct challenge
03:07.240 - 03:12.700:  to President Putin's authority. Last week Mr. Pregogin was killed in a plane crash along with
03:12.700 - 03:18.200:  nine others on board. The Kremlin denies any involvement, but there is widespread suspicion
03:18.800 - 03:22.360:  that the crash wasn't active revenge by the Russian authorities.
03:23.000 - 03:27.560:  Now with Steve Rosenberg reporting from St. Petersburg, the Russia editor for BBC Monitoring
03:27.560 - 03:33.500:  is Vitaly Shevchenko and he taught me more about the service. St. Petersburg is Yavgene Pregogin's
03:33.760 - 03:41.180:  home city and the cemetery in question called Borchovska. It's where his father is also buried.
03:41.180 - 03:48.580:  We understand. According to reports coming from Russia, he was buried in a private ceremony,
03:48.580 - 03:57.580:  which was the wish of his family. I think we can now say with almost complete certainty that we know
03:58.080 - 04:03.580:  where Yavgene Pregogin's body is right now. There have been in recent days numerous makeshift
04:03.580 - 04:08.340:  shrines for Yavgene Pregogin, people who were in support of the Wagner Mercery group and what they
04:08.340 - 04:14.580:  had done for Russia. What do you think will happen to his grave and his body? Do you think this
04:14.580 - 04:18.800:  may well become a focal point and if so, how do the authorities, how does the Kremlin respond to them?
04:19.220 - 04:27.160:  It's obvious that the Kremlin doesn't really want Yavgene Pregogin to become a martyr for people
04:27.160 - 04:34.540:  who are supportive of the war but are just as critical of Russia's top brass as Yavgene Pregogin
04:35.380 - 04:42.040:  and one example of how the Kremlin is trying to contain the sentiment is all Russian state of
04:42.040 - 04:48.400:  East saying about the plane crash that killed Yavgene Pregogin is that his plane crashed and he died
04:48.400 - 04:53.960:  without venturing into speculation about what might have caused that plane crash.
04:53.960 - 04:59.640:  And it is worth remembering, isn't it, that people who are critical of Vladimir Putin and his
04:59.640 - 05:09.160:  authority do not? It's unfortunately true that this scenario fits the logic of Russia as it is
05:09.160 - 05:16.980:  now under President Vladimir Putin. If there was a message in this accident, it is of course
05:16.980 - 05:25.340:  aimed at people with easy access to money and weapons. People who might start to entertain
05:25.340 - 05:30.760:  any ideas of challenging the Kremlin, they will have to think twice.
05:30.760 - 05:36.180:  That was Vitaly Shevchenko. A life threatening hurricane is heading to Florida,
05:36.180 - 05:41.480:  with US media warning it could be a once in a lifetime event for residents as it makes landfall
05:41.480 - 05:47.060:  on Wednesday. Schools have been closed and Tampa Airport has been shot. Evacuation orders have
05:47.060 - 05:51.840:  been issued. The authorities fear Hurricane Idalia could cause death and destruction.
05:52.500 - 05:56.960:  The Florida Governor, Rhonda Santis, has urged people in low-lying coastal areas to move to
05:56.960 - 06:04.140:  higher ground before it's too late. There have been evacuation orders issued for people on coastal
06:04.140 - 06:09.680:  areas, barrier islands, low-lying areas. You still have time, particularly if in the northern part
06:09.680 - 06:13.400:  of the state, to evacuate. You don't need to drive hundreds of miles. You don't need to try to
06:13.400 - 06:18.620:  outrun the storm. Just get to higher ground, get into a safe structure, be advised. You've got time,
06:18.620 - 06:24.080:  but time is running out. Now it was Rhonda Santis, meanwhile at a White House Geese briefing,
06:24.080 - 06:28.200:  the Anne-Criswell, who is the administrator of the US disaster relief agency,
06:28.200 - 06:34.280:  FEMA, gave this update on the hurricane. This storm is very strong and is expected to strengthen
06:34.280 - 06:39.860:  to a major hurricane by the time it makes landfall due to high surface temperatures in the Gulf
06:39.860 - 06:47.380:  of Mexico. This means heavy winds, high winds, heavy rain, and a forecasted 12-foot storm surge
06:47.820 - 06:54.060:  in some of the areas along the western coast. This is one of the highest-risk parts of a hurricane,
06:54.060 - 06:58.000:  and is especially problematic along the west coast of Florida.
06:58.600 - 07:02.120:  While also speaking to reporters at the White House, was president Biden, he said
07:02.120 - 07:07.800:  federal help was being provided to the state. We're in constant contact. I had the Director of
07:07.800 - 07:13.180:  FEMA in here today, earlier talking about it, hour to hour, we're watching this, and I told
07:13.180 - 07:18.200:  the governor and the mayor that we're there as long as it takes. We're going to make sure they
07:18.200 - 07:21.940:  have everything they need. The BBC's Luis Fajardo is in Miami.
07:22.700 - 07:29.440:  In Florida, there is a substantial amount of alarm. There are nearly 27 counties of Florida,
07:30.120 - 07:35.500:  which have some kind of evacuation order. Authorities have, for example, removed tools for many
07:35.500 - 07:41.800:  major highways in the state, and a lot of people are taking preparations with this storm, which has a
07:41.800 - 07:47.940:  very risky characteristic, the possibility of having a storm surge early on Wednesday morning,
07:47.940 - 07:54.100:  local time, when it's expected to make landfall in Florida. Basically, the sea floods into land
07:54.100 - 07:59.540:  areas, coastal areas, this happens fairly quickly, and it can cost an enormous amount of damage
07:59.540 - 08:04.260:  both in physical terms and in loss of life. On people heating the warnings in Florida,
08:04.640 - 08:09.620:  that is always a concern. Every year, there's thousands of people who decide not to evacuate,
08:09.620 - 08:13.880:  even if they're told in very strong terms by the authorities. In some cases, it is recent
08:13.880 - 08:19.400:  arrivals, who perhaps don't realize the danger they sometimes face. That was certainly the case
08:19.400 - 08:25.160:  last year during Hurricane Ian, when many people didn't actually evacuate, and unfortunately,
08:25.160 - 08:30.040:  the death toll was substantial. And this particular part of Florida, where the hurricane is supposed
08:30.040 - 08:34.980:  to have a direct impact in the so-called big bend, it is a relatively less densely populated
08:34.980 - 08:39.920:  area of the state, but it is an area of the state that unusually has not had a direct impact by
08:39.920 - 08:44.960:  this kind of hurricane in more than 100 years, and this also could potentially make it more dangerous.
08:45.340 - 08:48.960:  Give us a sense of what's happening on a state and also federal level.
08:49.140 - 08:55.200:  Certainly, the governor of Florida, Rondesanthus, has called for a federal declaration of emergency,
08:55.200 - 09:00.980:  which expedites the delivery of emergency assets to the regions. There's thousands of Florida
09:01.660 - 09:07.120:  state troopers National Guard also being mobilized. They are moving fuel resources around,
09:07.120 - 09:12.180:  but the local power utilities are also moving hundreds. In some cases, thousands of people
09:12.180 - 09:18.220:  to prepare them to go into action immediately after the hurricane, and to make sure that the power
09:18.220 - 09:22.920:  goes back on, which is particularly crucial in this time of the year when Florida is facing
09:22.920 - 09:27.460:  extremely high temperatures. And you can keep up to date with developments on our website
09:27.460 - 09:35.080:  at bbc.com slash news. Police in Nigeria say they've detained at least 67 men who were arrested
09:35.080 - 09:40.540:  while they were celebrating a wedding in one of the country's largest arrests targeting homosexuality.
09:40.540 - 09:47.280:  About 200 people were initially detained at the event in a hotel in Delta state. Our reporter
09:47.280 - 09:52.940:  is Induka Oranoma. The police announced that they had arrested the man they said was dressed
09:52.940 - 10:00.020:  as a woman in the late hours of Sunday. And he said he was an actor who was in Delta states in
10:00.020 - 10:05.620:  South Nigeria to shoot a movie. But the arrested person took him to the police station,
10:06.280 - 10:13.740:  and the police said he vented them that he belonged to a gay society that was holding an event,
10:13.800 - 10:19.820:  and he led the police to this event where the police then arrested 300 men.
10:20.520 - 10:26.520:  They said they found most of the men dressed as women, they found two men who were dressed as
10:26.520 - 10:32.940:  bride and groom, and they saw a recording of what apparently was a wedding that had taken place
10:32.940 - 10:40.700:  between both men. At the moment, they are getting ready to charge 67 of those men when they are
10:40.700 - 10:45.040:  done with their investigations. That's what they said. So some of those men were then released.
10:45.040 - 10:50.040:  We don't know how the police came to that decision to hold just this seven of them.
10:50.740 - 10:56.300:  Now for their part, the people who have been detained say they were models, they were
10:56.300 - 11:02.480:  photographers, they were actors that they this wasn't a gay wedding. And perhaps that response is
11:03.080 - 11:07.360:  not surprising, considered that homosexuality is outlawed in Nigeria. And there are,
11:08.000 - 11:12.420:  especially in some of the northern states of the country, potentially death penalties as a result,
11:12.500 - 11:19.140:  but throughout Nigeria, very harsh penalties for people to be found, to be engaging in homosexual
11:19.140 - 11:27.320:  activity. Yeah, exactly. It carries a 14-year jail term here to be involved in homosexual
11:27.580 - 11:36.160:  activities. Even those who tag that's accomplices. So in this case, the hotel, or for instance,
11:36.160 - 11:40.540:  or the manager of the hotel, where that event was held according to the police,
11:41.000 - 11:46.580:  can be charged for being an accomplice. But it's not the first time that such arrests would
11:46.580 - 11:52.460:  be made. A couple of years back, the police also arrested men, they said where at a gay event in
11:52.460 - 11:58.440:  Lagos, charged them to courts and nothing came out of it. The men denied that they had been there
11:58.440 - 12:03.000:  for other purposes rather than what the police accused them of. And do you got any amount there?
12:03.760 - 12:08.520:  The security forces in the Central African state of Gabon have arrested an opposition leader,
12:08.520 - 12:13.480:  who was part of a coalition that challenged President Alibongo in elections on Saturday,
12:13.480 - 12:19.040:  Rachel Wright reports. The vice president of the party for the reappropriation of Gabon was
12:19.040 - 12:24.640:  taken to the military intelligence headquarters in the capital Libraville. According to his colleague,
12:24.640 - 12:29.260:  no reason was given for the arrest. There are also reports that troops have been deployed
12:29.260 - 12:35.220:  near the homes of other opposition leaders. Gabon held presidential elections on the 26th of August
12:35.220 - 12:41.360:  that were widely marked by irregularities. President Alibongo was accused of electoral fraud
12:41.360 - 12:47.400:  by the opposition. The government in turn shut down the internet and imposed a curfew in a ban
12:47.400 - 12:52.460:  on French media outlets. It remains unclear when the results of the ballot will be released.
12:53.100 - 12:54.380:  The BBC's Rachel Wright
12:55.100 - 13:00.080:  As artificial intelligence evolves, some images can make us question if they're real or whether
13:00.080 - 13:05.340:  they've been digitally created or enhanced. You may have seen a photo of Pope Francis wearing
13:05.340 - 13:11.460:  a white puffer coat that was widely shared a few months ago, only to be revealed as an AI-generated
13:11.460 - 13:16.920:  image. Now, the Google company DeepMind is trialing a digital watermark, which it says
13:16.920 - 13:22.480:  will be able to detect images created by artificial intelligence. So how does it all work?
13:23.000 - 13:27.040:  Our technology reporter, Chris Valens explains. It's a bit different from those ones you
13:27.040 - 13:30.620:  see at embankments. You know, you can hold them up for the light and suddenly an image appears
13:30.620 - 13:37.200:  to the watermark. DeepMind synth ID system makes changes to an image that are imperceptible to
13:37.200 - 13:45.100:  the human eye, but which an AI system can spot. So then that AI can say, look, this is an AI-generated
13:45.100 - 13:49.840:  image. Now, obviously that's an advantage for two reasons. Firstly, with the watermark was visible,
13:49.840 - 13:54.460:  you might be able to try and remove it much more easily or crop the image so that you didn't
13:54.500 - 13:59.400:  include the watermark. And secondly, if you could see the watermark, of course, that would reduce
13:59.400 - 14:04.600:  the value of the image if you're using the AI generation for purposes other than misinformation,
14:04.600 - 14:10.380:  or maybe to generate a, I don't know, a corporate logo or a piece of art to illustrate an article
14:10.380 - 14:15.980:  or something like that, where you don't want the watermark visible. I'm cognizant of just how much
14:15.980 - 14:22.780:  content is generated every second of the day on the internet. With that in mind, just how
14:22.780 - 14:28.120:  effective could this tool be for countering disinformation? DeepMind calls this an experimental
14:28.300 - 14:33.780:  launch. And only some users of its imagined system were going to get to try it out. But there
14:33.780 - 14:38.700:  has been a commitment from the big AI firms to develop these watermarking tools that was
14:38.860 - 14:42.060:  part, because something that came out of a meeting at the White House where they talked about the
14:42.060 - 14:48.540:  threats that AI tools could present. And of course, this comes with a prospect of elections in
14:48.540 - 14:55.700:  the US looming ever closer. And it also, these kind of technologies have uses beyond misinformation,
14:56.420 - 15:01.460:  just as a consumer of content. I mean, quite important to know that perhaps the piece of art
15:01.460 - 15:06.880:  you're looking at, for example, was generated by a computer, not an artist in their Garrett. So
15:07.160 - 15:10.840:  there are other uses for this technology as well. Chris Valens there.
15:13.060 - 15:19.220:  Still to come of a global news podcast. We see a high level of violence at sea, especially
15:19.220 - 15:24.640:  from sub-Saharan African and Tunisian migrants. Some have threatened to throw babies on the sea.
15:24.840 - 15:29.480:  Others have threatened to send themselves on fire. A special report on the desperate lengths,
15:29.480 - 15:32.660:  some people will go to to escape from Africa to Europe.
15:41.160 - 15:46.320:  Police in Canada say they've brought an additional 12 charges against a man accused of supplying
15:46.320 - 15:52.940:  a poisonous chemical to people in more than 40 countries. Kenneth Law, who's 57 and from Ontario,
15:52.940 - 15:59.960:  was charged in May this year with two counts of counseling or aiding suicide. On Friday, the UK's
15:59.960 - 16:05.620:  National Crime Agency revealed he sold the substance to 88 people in the UK who later died,
16:05.620 - 16:12.760:  Angus Crawford reports. 11 separate police forces in the province of Ontario are now investigating
16:12.760 - 16:19.180:  deaths linked to Kenneth Law. In what today was described as a very active and a very complex
16:20.080 - 16:24.880:  investigation. At a press conference, it was revealed that Mr Law has now been charged with an
16:24.880 - 16:31.780:  additional 12 counts of counseling or aiding suicide, bringing the total number of charges to 14.
16:31.820 - 16:39.480:  The dead are thought to range in age from 16 to 36. On Friday of last week, the National Crime
16:39.480 - 16:47.520:  Agency here revealed that Mr Law had sent the substance to more than 270 people in the UK, 88 of
16:47.520 - 16:53.160:  whom later died, although it's not possible to link the chemical to the cause of death in all
16:53.160 - 16:59.120:  cases. Inspector Simon James from Ontario's York Regional Police said they were talking to
16:59.120 - 17:05.320:  investigators around the world. And we are cooperating and sharing information with law enforcement
17:05.320 - 17:12.560:  on a global scale. Let us be clear that we will not tolerate criminal actions by those who prey on
17:12.860 - 17:17.920:  vulnerable individuals in our communities and we will hold those responsible accountable.
17:18.520 - 17:25.260:  He confirmed that Kenneth Law sent more than 1200 packages to more than 40 countries and revealed
17:25.260 - 17:32.080:  that as well as selling the toxic chemical, the 57-year-old sent other equipment to assist clients to
17:32.080 - 17:38.000:  end their lives and warn families to be vigilant about what loved ones had been buying online.
17:38.620 - 17:43.060:  That was Angus Crawford. The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a
17:43.060 - 17:48.520:  flashpoint between India and Pakistan for decades. It's one of the world's most militarized zones.
17:49.240 - 17:54.320:  In August 2019, with little warning, India stripped the Indian administered part of Kashmir of
17:54.320 - 17:58.980:  its special autonomous status and brought it under central government control. That followed
17:58.980 - 18:03.840:  years of communal violence between Muslims and Hindus. It also split it into territories,
18:03.840 - 18:09.780:  Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Four years later, the Supreme Court has now asked the government to
18:09.780 - 18:15.140:  provide a time frame to return it to its previous status. The newsrooms, Lippur Kapalim,
18:15.180 - 18:18.800:  tell me more. Prime Minister Lander Modi and ruling a
18:18.800 - 18:25.400:  internationalist BJP party had long opposed article 370 which gave Kashmir India's only
18:25.400 - 18:32.240:  Muslim majority state limited autonomy. Scrapping it was part of the BJP's 2019 election manifesto.
18:32.300 - 18:38.140:  It was aimed at tightening Delhi's grip over the disputed region in the name of national security.
18:38.520 - 18:44.160:  Given that this was such a central pillar for the BJP's election manifesto back in 2019,
18:44.300 - 18:49.920:  how is the government responded today? The position of the central government that Jammu and
18:49.920 - 18:56.340:  Kashmir will get back its statehood is not anyone. In October 2021, during his visit to Kashmir,
18:56.360 - 19:01.240:  the Home Minister Amit Shah promised that the statehood would be restored soon without
19:01.240 - 19:06.740:  specifying a time frame. And Mr Mehta, the solicitor general, told the court the current status
19:06.740 - 19:12.760:  was not a permanent feature in his words and that Kashmir would be reversed to a state once
19:12.760 - 19:18.740:  normality has returned. And this spokesperson for the BJP for Kashmir has recently claimed that
19:18.740 - 19:26.040:  since the abrogation of 370, tourism is at an all-time high and for the first time an international
19:26.040 - 19:30.920:  event such as G20 summit on tourism took place there earlier this year.
19:31.220 - 19:35.940:  Which brings us on to how has the last four years changed the lives of the people living in the region?
19:36.140 - 19:42.200:  Human rights activists in both India and abroad have accused Delhi of intimidation and indiscriminate
19:42.200 - 19:47.720:  arrests, including of journalists in the territory. And residents and local politicians call the move
19:47.720 - 19:53.360:  as the BJP's bid to impose what they call settler colonialism, which is aimed at changing the
19:53.360 - 19:57.460:  demography of the region and land ownership. And now, despite the Supreme Court's demand,
19:57.460 - 20:00.760:  people in the valley say they have little hope, anything will change.
20:01.240 - 20:07.140:  That was Lippaker Palem. With only 200 kilometers of water separating it from the Italian
20:07.140 - 20:12.560:  island of Lempadusa, the Tunisian coastline has now become the busiest route in the world
20:12.560 - 20:18.660:  for migrants looking for a way into Europe. In the first six months of this year, nearly 55,000
20:18.660 - 20:23.840:  people were picked up by the Italian or Tunisian coast guards, that's according to the United Nations.
20:23.840 - 20:28.740:  That's almost double the number who attempted the crossing in all of 2022.
20:29.480 - 20:33.220:  BBC Arabic's Basan Benoui went on patrol with the Tunisian coast guard,
20:33.580 - 20:37.220:  witnessing nine migrant boats intercepted in just 24 hours.
20:41.540 - 20:45.700:  Within half an hour of us boarding the coast guard's petrol boat,
20:46.420 - 20:49.260:  the Red R intercepts its first signal.
20:51.700 - 20:58.080:  At first, two smaller, more agile speedboats are deployed to locate the migrant boat
20:59.040 - 21:00.500:  before towing it back.
21:03.420 - 21:11.480:  But as the boats 46 passengers begin to disembark, the Tunisian coast guards are met with a wave of anger.
21:12.280 - 21:16.980:  Let us sue to Italy, one of them shouts.
21:18.560 - 21:25.720:  All from West Africa, mostly Guinea and the Ivory Coast, many of them tell us it's their third
21:25.720 - 21:29.820:  even fourth attempt to rust the small stretch of sea.
21:33.620 - 21:36.180:  We are also human. We also want to be happy.
21:37.320 - 21:42.060:  Our families at home have nothing. We are trying to get Europe to send money home.
21:44.140 - 21:51.580:  Tunisia is a poor country. We do not have jobs. We do not know where we will sleep.
21:53.720 - 21:54.240:  Let us leave.
21:54.920 - 22:01.940:  Although we are allowed to follow the operation, the six coast guards on board are not answering any of our
22:01.940 - 22:08.340:  questions. Instead, their spokesman, Jose Medinic Bebli, speaks to us back at the port.
22:09.740 - 22:15.600:  We see a high level of islands at sea, especially from sub-Saharan African and Tunisian migrants.
22:15.760 - 22:20.740:  Some have threatened to throw babies on the sea. Others have threatened to set themselves on fire.
22:24.140 - 22:30.700:  After releasing all the passengers back onto Tunisian soil, the ships Red R soon detects another boat.
22:31.380 - 22:38.100:  It's a makeshift iron boat. Around 20 people on board begging us for food and water.
22:38.880 - 22:47.500:  They say they've been adrift for more than 12 hours. Hailing from Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria,
22:48.320 - 22:50.420:  they tell us they're fleeing from war.
22:50.420 - 23:00.820:  Sailing back out into the channel, we see many clothes and shoes floating on the water.
23:01.460 - 23:07.400:  Local authorities say more than 700 and identified people, including infants,
23:08.260 - 23:14.500:  have been buried in unmarket graves on the outskirts of Svaks since the beginning of this year.
23:16.260 - 23:19.880:  Another vessel, but this time full of Tunisians,
23:20.520 - 23:28.820:  Hailing from one of the poorest suburbs of Tunis, Subur-Haji says this was his fourth failed attempt.
23:32.700 - 23:39.220:  I no longer care. I have already lost everything, so I will take a gamble on my life
23:39.960 - 23:42.500:  because I feel as if I am already dead.
23:44.560 - 23:51.380:  As we drive away from the port, there are dozens of migrants walking along the side of the road.
23:51.380 - 23:56.080:  We will sleep here tonight and these olive groves, one man tells us.
23:56.080 - 24:02.760:  And then we will try again, says another, despite the chance of being intercepted again
24:02.780 - 24:10.060:  and the very risk of downing these young men are resolute. They will try to reach Europe again.
24:10.860 - 24:17.140:  BBC Airomix mass embellenit with that report. A former world champion and a young American player
24:17.140 - 24:22.340:  he accused of cheating have resolved their year-long dispute that's gripped the world of chess.
24:22.960 - 24:27.680:  The Norwegian Magnus Carlson had made the claims after he was unexpectedly beaten by Hans
24:28.540 - 24:32.980:  in a tournament last September. The American had denied any wrongdoing,
24:32.980 - 24:37.960:  although he did admit to cheating in two online games when he was 12 and 16.
24:37.960 - 24:40.080:  With more details, he shone off.
24:40.560 - 24:46.100:  This was a scandal that rocked the chess world. Magnus Carlson, the five times world champion,
24:46.100 - 24:52.200:  had made accusations of cheating after losing to his young rival, the 20-year-old prodigy Hans
24:53.400 - 24:58.640:  The Acrimonius dispute had prompted elaborate theories on social media about high-tech
24:58.640 - 25:04.700:  methods for cheating, such as hidden electronic devices or vibrating anal beads. Mr
25:04.700 - 25:08.700:  Neiman responded by saying he would play naked to show nothing was being concealed,
25:09.460 - 25:13.980:  and in his next move launched a hundred million dollar lawsuit to clear his name.
25:14.060 - 25:19.740:  But the online platform, chess.com, says an outer court agreement has now been reached
25:19.740 - 25:23.860:  with an acceptance that there was no cheating. Everything was above board,
25:24.300 - 25:27.240:  and the two men can play again. Sean Coffland there.
25:27.960 - 25:32.860:  Now, there may be a rather simple way to provide pain relief to babies. It's to play them something
25:32.860 - 25:33.640:  like this.
25:46.200 - 25:50.220:  It's a lullaby by Mozart. That's the suggestion from research
25:50.220 - 25:55.920:  just published by Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. Rebecca Slater,
25:55.920 - 26:01.500:  who is Professor of Pediatric Neuroscience at Oxford University, told Sarah Montague about it.
26:02.040 - 26:05.580:  They've conducted a really well-designed study where they've taken a hundred babies,
26:05.580 - 26:10.940:  and half of them have listened to Mozart during a painful procedure and the other half haven't.
26:11.080 - 26:14.740:  And what they've found is for the ones that listen to Mozart during this procedure,
26:14.740 - 26:20.220:  which was a blood test where the heel of the foot is pricked, was that these babies showed less pain
26:20.220 - 26:25.020:  according to a clinical pain score. Right, so what do we think is going on?
26:25.280 - 26:30.700:  So the idea is that by providing comforting stimulation, in this case listening to a piece of
26:30.700 - 26:35.740:  music by Mozart, it might be able to change the way a baby responds to a painful procedure.
26:35.740 - 26:40.660:  So what they're doing is they're looking at the way babies respond by looking at their facial
26:40.660 - 26:46.180:  activity or how much they cry or whether their breathing rates go up or down, and they're using all
26:46.180 - 26:50.300:  of this information to get a pain score. And what they're finding is that when the babies are
26:50.300 - 26:55.440:  listening to the music, they're having less of this type of response following the heel length.
26:55.640 - 26:59.840:  Now, it used to be thought that babies didn't feel pain in the same way as adults,
26:59.840 - 27:04.320:  but it was your research that to disprove that. So it wasn't just my research,
27:04.320 - 27:10.500:  so lots of groups that have really shown now that babies do show responses to painful procedures.
27:11.160 - 27:15.160:  Certainly, we did some work recently looking at changes in brain activity,
27:15.160 - 27:19.840:  but prior to that, it's been known for a long time now that babies do respond to pain.
27:20.000 - 27:23.860:  Just like adults. Similar to adults. So if you look at the change in brain activity,
27:23.860 - 27:28.440:  that you see in an adult when they tell you they're in pain, it's really similar to that that
27:28.440 - 27:33.680:  you'll see in a baby when they can't tell you. So we can make some assumptions about the experience
27:33.680 - 27:38.860:  that the babies are having, even though they can't talk. Do we know if it's music or do we know
27:38.860 - 27:43.880:  if it has to be Mozart? Well, there's definitely no evidence from this study that it has to be
27:43.880 - 27:49.000:  Mozart, and it could be that all different types of music might be helpful. But they chose Mozart
27:49.000 - 27:54.140:  because it's got lots of minor tones, and it's also got a soothing effect, which is why it's
27:54.140 - 27:59.340:  been part of this album that they've used in order to help provide this stimulation.
27:59.760 - 28:03.540:  Do we know if a mother's voice or a father's voice has any effect?
28:04.000 - 28:08.920:  So that's another area of research that other groups have done. And yes, it's also been shown
28:08.920 - 28:14.600:  that when parents talk to their babies, this can be helpful. So perhaps parents singing lullabies
28:14.600 - 28:19.480:  might be another way in which we can provide additional comfort for these babies during the
28:19.480 - 28:25.260:  procedures. I wonder if there's a longer term effect as well. Do we know that pain in babies has
28:25.260 - 28:30.520:  longer term consequences? So we do. There's been lots of studies suggesting that pain in early
28:30.520 - 28:35.840:  life can alter the way that you respond to pain when you're older. So one of the questions would be
28:35.840 - 28:41.620:  that if you provide these interventions in early life, can you actually change the way that they
28:41.620 - 28:46.820:  respond later? But certainly this hasn't been done in this study, but it's something that could be
28:46.820 - 28:50.940:  looked into. What about music for adults when they're having some painful procedure? I mean,
28:50.940 - 28:56.280:  certainly some women really like to have music going through intense experiences such as child
28:56.280 - 29:01.320:  birth. So imagine there'll be lots of benefits for adults as well. That was Rebecca Slater speaking
