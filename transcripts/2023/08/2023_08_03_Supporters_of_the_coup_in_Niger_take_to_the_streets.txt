00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:16.440:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:18.500 - 00:23.520:  I'm Janet Gillil and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 3rd of August, these are our main stories.
00:24.260 - 00:29.400:  Supporters of last week's coup in Niger have gathered in the capital to denounce international
00:29.480 - 00:36.020:  sanctions. North Korea has for the first time confirmed it's holding a US soldier who dashed
00:36.020 - 00:41.440:  across the border from South Korea last month. Germany, who are among the favourites who win the
00:41.440 - 00:49.280:  women's football world cup, have been knocked out. Also in this podcast, heavier than a blue whale,
00:49.280 - 00:55.000:  scientists find the remains of a marine animal which lived 40 million years ago.
00:55.400 - 01:01.440:  Well there's only 18 of these bones but just take the vertebrae that they have. Each one of those
01:01.440 - 01:10.180:  big backbones is over 100 kilos. That's all coming up but first let's go to Niger.
01:15.220 - 01:21.080:  Hundreds of people turned out in a central square in the capital Niami to demonstrate in support
01:21.080 - 01:27.380:  of the recent military coup. Many of them carried Russian flags and chanted slogans calling for
01:27.380 - 01:33.960:  France to leave. Niger, a former French colony, is a vast country with lucrative uranium reserves
01:34.660 - 01:39.840:  but its people consistently rank as having the lowest standards of living of anywhere in the world.
01:40.600 - 01:45.240:  Western countries have been evacuating hundreds of their nationals after the French embassy was
01:45.240 - 01:50.320:  attacked by protesters on Sunday. We got more from our Africa regional editor Uros.
01:50.920 - 01:57.380:  A large crowd gathered at Independence Square. This was a rally really called by a coalition of
01:57.380 - 02:04.560:  civil society groups that have for quite some months now been calling for protests against the
02:04.560 - 02:09.540:  presence of French troops in the country and against the fact that Niger has become this
02:09.840 - 02:16.160:  pretty close ally of western nations who are trying to fight the jihadist insurgency across the
02:16.160 - 02:22.400:  region. But a large crowd and amongst the crowd quite a lot of chance against France but also
02:22.400 - 02:29.660:  against the sanctions that have been imposed by the regional bloc, ECOS and some chance and flags
02:30.820 - 02:36.260:  supporting Russia but ought to stress, you know, in Niger the country's pretty split on
02:36.920 - 02:41.020:  whether they're in support of this coup or not. There are many people who believe
02:41.740 - 02:46.620:  that the coup leaders themselves were really in danger of being replaced and losing their jobs
02:46.620 - 02:50.580:  and so they move for their own protection really and that's what this is all about.
02:50.920 - 02:54.080:  I was going to ask you about that because it's very difficult to assess how much
02:54.080 - 02:59.260:  popular support there really is for the coup but also this waving of the Russian flags that started
02:59.260 - 03:04.220:  right from the beginning didn't it? It did and it's exactly the same script as we've seen in
03:04.220 - 03:09.780:  Marley and Bikina Faso when the military took over there a sort of rather suspicious presence of
03:09.780 - 03:15.980:  Russian flags just at the moment when the military men have taken power and of course the military
03:15.980 - 03:23.200:  leaders are looking to try and justify their actions so as soon as they'd seized power the anti-French
03:23.200 - 03:27.900:  sentiment was whipped up and then the presence of these Russian flags, I mean not many of them
03:27.900 - 03:33.700:  but I mean in Niger there are, you mentioned the poverty, there are huge challenges in terms of
03:33.700 - 03:38.680:  the insecurity and the poverty and many people do say look France and other countries including
03:38.680 - 03:43.440:  the UN in the Sahel region have been trying to fight the jihadis but have failed to make any real
03:43.440 - 03:49.180:  inroads. And briefly what's the latest on the evacuations? We're not talking about huge numbers this
03:49.180 - 03:53.520:  is very different from you know the kind of evacuations in a place like Khartoum when the conflict
03:53.520 - 03:59.380:  broke out there but most of the European countries say that the people they had offered flights to
03:59.380 - 04:04.660:  have now left and a small number remain behind but it is at the moment a tense situation but
04:04.660 - 04:10.420:  there's no fighting going on. Well Ross, since last month we've been reporting on the bizarre story
04:10.420 - 04:16.020:  of the US soldier who crossed one of the most heavily guarded borders in the world from south to
04:16.020 - 04:22.400:  North Korea. The 23 year old soldier Travis King had been on a guided tour of the border when he
04:22.400 - 04:28.440:  dashed across. Why did he do it? Well we know he'd just been released from custody in South Korea
04:28.760 - 04:34.120:  where he'd been held on assault charges and was being escorted back to the US when he managed to
04:34.120 - 04:40.120:  escape and then joined this tour. Washington has been trying to work out what has happened to him
04:40.720 - 04:46.960:  and it has been receiving radio silence from Pyongyang at least that is until now.
04:47.200 - 04:52.420:  Our correspondent in Seoul, Jean McKenzie, told us more. The last two weeks obviously as you say
04:52.420 - 04:56.660:  the US have been trying to make contact with the North Koreans to find out where Travis King is
04:56.660 - 05:01.320:  and what's happening. Now the way that they have to do this is through what's called the UN
05:01.320 - 05:06.560:  command. Now this is the body that operates the demilitarized zone so that strip of land between
05:06.620 - 05:12.280:  North and South Korea and this is the strip of land that Travis King was on this tour of when he
05:12.280 - 05:17.500:  decided to dash over the border. So the UN command has this direct phone line to the North Korean
05:17.500 - 05:22.140:  military which they use pretty much every day to check in with the North Korean military as part
05:23.280 - 05:27.460:  of their remit to keep the peace. So they've used this phone line over the last couple of weeks to
05:27.460 - 05:32.620:  send messages to the North Koreans to basically ask about Travis King and ask for information
05:33.080 - 05:36.760:  and what they've had is just the North Koreans picking up the phone because that's part of this
05:36.800 - 05:41.400:  channel. That's how this works and just simply receiving the message. They haven't actually had a
05:41.400 - 05:46.540:  response. They've just had an acknowledgement that the North Koreans are hearing their message
05:46.540 - 05:52.840:  but we know now that at some point over the last 48 hours the North Koreans have sent their first
05:52.840 - 05:58.980:  proper response. So they've acknowledged that Travis King is in their custody and they have
05:59.380 - 06:05.140:  you know replied to the UN command but the UN command today they're being very cautious with what
06:05.140 - 06:09.780:  they say. They don't want to reveal the details about what's in this response because they say
06:09.780 - 06:14.580:  they don't want to interfere with their efforts that they're currently doing to try and get Travis
06:14.580 - 06:18.800:  King home. It's a very sensitive time now that it seems the North Koreans want to engage.
06:19.480 - 06:26.140:  So we're thinking that this is the North Koreans taking the first step in negotiations which could
06:26.140 - 06:31.160:  lead to the release of Travis King. Well certainly yes it's the first time that they're saying right
06:31.160 - 06:36.860:  okay we're ready to talk in some way. It could be that they're ready to negotiate or maybe it's
06:36.860 - 06:41.300:  that they're getting ready to show us what their next move is. They still haven't publicly
06:42.140 - 06:45.900:  acknowledged that they have Travis King in the country or that any of this has happened.
06:46.880 - 06:52.080:  I think there is concern now about how the North Koreans are going to approach this. There are
06:52.080 - 06:57.400:  many different avenues they could take. They could use Private Travis King as propaganda, as domestic
06:57.400 - 07:03.440:  propaganda, to highlight a US soldier who was so dissatisfied with life at home or life in the US army
07:03.440 - 07:07.760:  that he's chosen to come and live in North Korea. That's one way. The other way of course is that
07:07.760 - 07:12.880:  they use him to make an example out of and they say this is the soldier who crossed into our
07:13.360 - 07:18.900:  country illegally without permission and they put him on trial for example and the consequences
07:18.900 - 07:24.400:  of that could be extremely severe which is why this is such a delicate time and I think that this
07:24.400 - 07:29.700:  UN command with the US alongside them will be doing everything they can to just try and negotiate
07:29.700 - 07:36.340:  his return. Jean McKenzie in Seoul. For the past 18 months many Ukrainian families have been
07:36.340 - 07:42.400:  separated torn apart as fathers and husbands stayed behind to fight the Russians while wives and
07:42.400 - 07:48.800:  children fled. Our special correspondent, Furgle King, reports on one family story of separation
07:49.020 - 08:02.140:  and brief reunion. That is the sound of a family planning something they've looked forward to
08:02.180 - 08:09.360:  for the last year and a half, a return to Ukraine. It's July now and the family are preparing
08:10.460 - 08:14.640:  for the trip of a lifetime not one they'd ever have dreamed of making in the past.
08:19.580 - 08:27.660:  This is hard to credit to believe in the Europe of 2022. People are just crushing all around me,
08:27.660 - 08:32.640:  trying to get out of these trains. A woman, a young mother with a baby, they're screaming because
08:32.640 - 08:40.180:  everyone's getting crushed. Oksana Onichuk, her 13-year-old son Ilja, a nine-year-old daughter Anna,
08:40.340 - 08:44.740:  were among the thousands fleeing west from the railway station here in Liviv.
08:45.520 - 08:51.520:  Husband, Jenny, was a man of fighting age and so not allowed to go with them. He pressed his
08:51.520 - 08:57.480:  palm to the window of the train. He, Oksana and the children all were weeping.
09:01.520 - 09:08.840:  Jenny, a slender, gentle man, went back to Harkiv, back to Russian shelling, burned out buildings,
09:08.840 - 09:17.060:  food shortages and memories of a vanished life. This February, he showed us around the playground
09:17.060 - 09:26.660:  next to the family flat. I used to play basketball as my son there, all sorts of things
09:26.660 - 09:32.060:  were flying here from different directions. Half of the playground is missing.
09:42.280 - 09:47.860:  On the other side of Europe, 1,500 miles away, Oksana and the children found refuge in Britain.
09:47.860 - 09:54.140:  An English speaker, she got a job teaching Ukrainian refugee children at a local school in Surrey.
10:04.340 - 10:06.320:  It's far away from us.
10:14.620 - 10:18.780:  Most nights, as long as there's power in Harkiv, the family has a Zoom call.
10:19.400 - 10:24.880:  The talk is of schoolwork, news of the family cat stranded like Jenny in Ukraine.
10:27.920 - 10:31.840:  But Oksana has been saving and with Jenny she's come up with a plan.
10:34.420 - 10:38.400:  She and the children are going to meet him in one of the safer cities in Ukraine for a holiday.
10:39.340 - 10:41.560:  After 18 months, they'll be reunited.
10:44.420 - 10:47.520:  Every hour, we are closer and closer to him.
10:49.340 - 10:53.720:  I've never had such just drawn emotions like now I have.
10:56.280 - 10:59.480:  Ukrainian flag, just across the field. Look.
10:59.480 - 11:09.320:  Finally, we are here and can't wait to see Jenny.
11:12.360 - 11:15.620:  Anna is first off the train and into her father's arms.
11:18.480 - 11:23.240:  Ilja grasps his hand, then Oksana.
11:26.320 - 11:26.340:  Anna.
11:28.900 - 11:32.260:  Into the embrace of the man she's loved since they were both 15.
11:35.200 - 11:37.080:  I can't believe it, Jenny says.
11:40.360 - 11:42.340:  In a month, they'll have to say goodbye again.
11:43.260 - 11:47.280:  But Jenny's words from Liviv Station at the beginning of the war come back.
11:48.100 - 11:49.700:  Everything will be fine.
11:50.900 - 11:53.060:  They are more than just words to this family.
11:53.540 - 11:58.140:  They are an enduring act of faith that war has not destroyed.
11:59.380 - 12:01.340:  That report by Fergal Keen.
12:02.540 - 12:06.780:  Many museums around the world contain art and artifacts that were stolen from their
12:06.780 - 12:07.760:  countries of origin.
12:08.180 - 12:12.760:  And recently there's been a real push to repatriate items to their original owners.
12:13.380 - 12:15.620:  The latest case is Australia's National Gallery.
12:15.620 - 12:20.840:  It's just announced that it will return three ninth and tenth century bronze sculptures to
12:20.840 - 12:21.400:  Cambodia.
12:22.020 - 12:27.720:  Ilja Pacific editor Michael Bristol told us more about the sculptures and why Australia had agreed
12:28.040 - 12:28.680:  to return them.
12:29.260 - 12:33.080:  Well, as you indicated there, these sculptures are very beautiful, very delicate,
12:33.520 - 12:38.020:  over a thousand years old from the charm kingdom which are occupied,
12:38.020 - 12:41.520:  much of central Vietnam and Cambodia.
12:42.040 - 12:47.240:  They apparently would dug up in a field in 1994 and it appears that there were then
12:47.620 - 12:52.580:  traffic to cross the border to Thailand and ended up in the collection of a British art
12:52.580 - 12:55.360:  dealer and collector called Douglas Lachford.
12:55.360 - 13:03.040:  He then sold them in 2011 to the National Gallery of Australia for $1.5 million US dollars.
13:03.500 - 13:08.880:  Mr. Lachford died in 2020 but subsequently his reputation has been damaged.
13:09.580 - 13:14.660:  He's not only was an art dealer and collector, he actually trafficked stolen goods and
13:15.080 - 13:21.200:  after an investigation by the gallery in Australia they decided that these were in fact stolen
13:21.200 - 13:27.980:  artifacts, interestingly that investigation into these statues was conducted with Mr. Lachford's
13:28.360 - 13:30.020:  daughter with the help of her.
13:30.020 - 13:36.380:  So they've decided to send these back to Cambodia and there was a ceremony in which they
13:37.060 - 13:41.340:  handed them over. Actually, there won't be handed over for three years because the Cambodians
13:41.340 - 13:45.520:  are just building a museum to hold them but then they'll be sent back to where they came from.
13:46.300 - 13:47.020:  Michael Bristair.
13:49.360 - 13:50.600:  Still to come on this podcast?
13:51.200 - 13:55.240:  I'm very angry and feel like burning the entire country.
13:55.940 - 13:57.640:  Don't I have the right to live here?
13:58.280 - 14:00.080:  The authorities didn't stand by me.
14:00.080 - 14:03.060:  They didn't even come to enquire my well-being.
14:03.580 - 14:08.180:  We hear from the victims as the latest round of Hindu Muslim violence in India.
14:16.280 - 14:21.480:  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. A ceasefire between Colombia's government and the left-wing
14:21.480 - 14:28.020:  guerrilla group National Liberation Army or ELN comes into force today and will last for six months.
14:28.780 - 14:34.620:  It's an important step for Colombia, a country that's faced domestic insurgencies since the 1960s.
14:35.180 - 14:39.860:  In 2016, Colombia's government signed a peace deal with the larger FARC rebel group
14:39.860 - 14:44.780:  ending a conflict that saw more than 200,000 people killed.
14:45.340 - 14:47.780:  Here's our South America correspondent, Katie Watson.
14:48.460 - 14:53.980:  Colombia's president Gustavo Pedro came to power last year, promising to bring peace to a country
14:53.980 - 14:59.540:  long troubled by civil war. If the ceasefire holds, it'll be the longest time the ELN has
14:59.540 - 15:06.100:  agreed to halt the conflict that started in 1964, and it'll be a major victory for Mr. Petro,
15:06.500 - 15:10.680:  whom himself is a former member of the now defunct M19 rebel group.
15:11.320 - 15:16.080:  The ceasefire will last 180 days after which it may be extended.
15:16.740 - 15:21.160:  There are however many who doubt the ability of the rebel group to comply with the ceasefire
15:21.680 - 15:24.700:  talks between the two sides have collapsed several times already,
15:25.320 - 15:30.300:  and this concern that more extreme elements within the ELN could violate the deal.
15:30.980 - 15:36.740:  All this comes at a difficult time for Mr. Petro, who's losing popularity and mid-growing corruption
15:36.740 - 15:43.800:  scandals. Katie Watson, since the Hindu nationalist BJP came to power in India nearly a decade ago,
15:44.280 - 15:49.300:  there's been an alarming rise in communal violence and hate crimes, many of them against Muslims.
15:50.040 - 15:53.660:  The Northern State of Haryana is the latest to be rocked by such violence.
15:53.740 - 15:58.880:  It began on Monday when a Hindu right-wing group led a religious procession in a
15:58.880 - 16:04.680:  predominantly Muslim district of the city of New. At least six people were killed and dozens more
16:04.680 - 16:08.380:  injured. The state authorities have beefed up security measures,
16:08.720 - 16:13.820:  amid concerns the violence could spread to Delhi. Arunade Mukherjee reports.
16:14.780 - 16:18.900:  The city of New Bears has a deserted look. The only cars that we are seeing on the roads are
16:18.900 - 16:25.280:  those of officials, government vehicles. There is heavy police and paramilitary presence.
16:25.280 - 16:29.780:  In fact, additional troops have been sent by the federal government to help the state
16:29.780 - 16:35.120:  government in containing law and order. While no further clashes have been reported in this area,
16:35.120 - 16:40.860:  the situation still remains tense. We don't see anyone on the roads. All the shops are shut.
16:41.720 - 16:45.700:  Internet is down as well. In this area as well as in the neighboring areas.
16:46.540 - 16:52.020:  The heavy police deployment trying to douse the flames after violence broke out between Hindus
16:52.020 - 16:59.240:  and Muslims. Rioting mobs went on a rampage, burning cars, breaking in and looting shops.
17:00.020 - 17:05.200:  Violence began in these parts when a Hindu religious procession was passing through a Muslim
17:05.200 - 17:10.720:  majority area. The man at the center of the conflict, Monu Maniser from a right wing Hindu
17:10.720 - 17:17.300:  group, wanted in the murder of two Muslim men in February this year, but still on the run.
17:19.180 - 17:25.640:  He posted a video on social media, brazening it out and announcing his participation at the Hindu
17:25.640 - 17:32.900:  march. His defiant call angered local Muslims, igniting several hours of violence.
17:35.500 - 17:40.460:  Sattaprakashgarh sits outside his confectionery shop which was destroyed in the violence.
17:43.320 - 17:46.460:  He opens the shutters to reveal the extent of damage.
17:48.320 - 17:52.260:  All we can see up this is a glass. All the glasses have been broken.
17:53.060 - 17:58.780:  This was a confectionery shop selling bread, cake and daily essentials. The food items which
17:58.780 - 18:05.080:  have been rotting for the last two days are on the floor and the stench is very strong.
18:06.580 - 18:13.600:  A business that took three years to build destroyed within minutes, torn apart bit by bit.
18:16.420 - 18:22.260:  I'm very angry and feel like burning the entire country. Don't I have the right to live here?
18:23.060 - 18:29.680:  I feel helpless. The authorities didn't stand by me. They didn't even come to inquire my well-being.
18:30.140 - 18:35.760:  What do I do? The violence which started in new spread to other parts of the state,
18:36.680 - 18:43.200:  evidence of arson and destruction visible in neighboring cities. In Gurugram, on the outskirts of
18:43.200 - 18:51.380:  Delhi, a mosque was set on fire and its cleric, 22-year-old Sad Amin, woken up and killed by a mob.
18:52.040 - 18:58.960:  Riazuddin, an official at the mosque, meets us a few kilometers away. He says he is terrified of going back.
19:01.880 - 19:08.580:  Why target him? What had he done? If you had a problem with the mosque, you target the mosque.
19:09.500 - 19:11.060:  But why take an innocent life?
19:14.100 - 19:20.560:  The cleanup in new has begun. We see charred cars being towed away by officials and workers
19:21.040 - 19:25.160:  sweeping away remnants of the destruction left behind by the violence.
19:26.360 - 19:32.440:  But the mistrust will linger for a while. These clashes on the outskirts of the capital city of Delhi
19:32.820 - 19:37.260:  have the start of an election season could have political ramifications.
19:38.260 - 19:40.360:  That report by Arunadeh Mukherjee.
19:41.100 - 19:46.300:  U.S. and Canadian fire crews are still battling to contain the eagle-bluff wildfire that nearly
19:46.300 - 19:52.220:  engulfed the town of Osuyu's in British Columbia over the weekend, forcing hundreds of people
19:52.220 - 19:58.140:  to evacuate to safer ground. Teams on both sides of the border have been carrying out controlled
19:58.140 - 20:06.040:  burns to create a fire break over 1800 hectares of steep and rocky terrain, which poses safety
20:06.060 - 20:11.680:  risks to crews. An ortho-america correspondent, Netotovik, is on the Canadian side of the border.
20:14.380 - 20:18.240:  Claiming to breathe out of their pool and backyard. That's all ash.
20:19.780 - 20:25.680:  Tasha and Dean Maynard are just relieved to be back home. The eagle-bluff wildfire initially
20:25.680 - 20:31.460:  spread so quickly from the U.S. border that it wasn't long before fire crews came to their
20:31.460 - 20:36.280:  neighborhood in the Osuyu's golf course to tell them to evacuate immediately.
20:36.280 - 20:41.900:  There was a big dark black plume of smoke that happened just as I came outside so I turned around
20:41.900 - 20:45.160:  and told the girls go start packing. I'm pretty sure we're going to be leaving.
20:45.680 - 20:49.720:  Within the five-ten minutes of packing up and going out, the engulfment you could see it
20:50.080 - 20:55.420:  in the backside just coming over and from there to the time we went to our friend's house and
20:56.060 - 21:02.440:  sitting on their deck and watching it, it was already at the point of our place within minutes.
21:05.120 - 21:09.600:  For hours, the Maynards and residents watch the inferno building in front of them.
21:09.780 - 21:15.760:  The wildfire is still growing days later, but at least for now, it's expanding away from town
21:15.780 - 21:22.940:  to the west. I'm on the highway overlooking the mountains where the eagle-bluff fire is still
21:22.940 - 21:30.900:  very much raging, a smoke pillowing into the sky. Currently, there are two water bomber planes
21:30.900 - 21:36.480:  that have been carrying water from the lake Osuyu's into the mountains to try to contain this.
21:36.480 - 21:40.860:  In fact, they've been doing that for the last several days relentlessly working hard,
21:41.440 - 21:45.720:  but despite that, officials say this fire is still very much out of control.
21:46.700 - 21:50.740:  It's definitely like we had an early start to the season and we're still into the heat of our
21:50.740 - 21:57.200:  summer here. Shaley Sterns with the Wildfire Service in British Columbia says teams on the US
21:57.200 - 22:04.240:  and Canadian sides have been carrying out controlled burns to create a fire break over 1800 hectares
22:04.240 - 22:09.780:  of steep and rocky terrain which pose safety risks to crews. We've seen some significant
22:09.780 - 22:16.620:  growth on that west side of the fire. The fire is estimated at 3,044 hectares in size and we're
22:16.620 - 22:22.120:  working with the incident management team on the US portion of the fires and looking at objectives
22:22.120 - 22:28.660:  that we can identify and assess along that west side. The eagle-bluff wildfire is one out of more
22:28.660 - 22:33.980:  than a thousand burning across Canada right now, believed to be fueled by higher than usual
22:33.980 - 22:40.680:  temperatures and drought. Netatoolfic in British Columbia. There's been a rather huge discovery
22:40.680 - 22:47.740:  in Peru, literally. Massive burns, the size and weight of boulders have been identified as a
22:47.740 - 22:53.600:  fossilised remains of an early mammal. It's supposed to have lived nearly 40 million years ago
22:53.960 - 22:59.360:  and may possibly have been the heaviest animal ever, weighing even more than the blue whale.
22:59.880 - 23:05.240:  Our science correspondent Jonathan Amos told us more about how the remains of this prehistoric
23:05.240 - 23:11.040:  creature were found. Well it was quite a long road to this discovery. The bones themselves were
23:11.040 - 23:16.840:  first found 13 years ago but they were so big and locked away in rock that it took three years to
23:16.840 - 23:22.200:  come out of the rock face and then transport them to Lima, the capital of Peru where they could study
23:22.200 - 23:27.820:  them and they've just published a paper now of that description in the journal Nature. Well there's
23:27.820 - 23:35.480:  only 18 of these bones but just take the vertebra that they have. Each one of those big backbugs
23:35.980 - 23:40.540:  is over 100 kilos and they're really dense as well so when they try to drill into them
23:41.140 - 23:47.080:  the drill bit actually broke and that speaks to the nature of the skeleton. So this skeleton is
23:47.360 - 23:52.740:  is not only made up of very dense bone but the bones themselves are kind of oversized
23:53.380 - 23:59.440:  that's to say they've got extra growth on their exterior surfaces and so that makes for a very
23:59.820 - 24:06.180:  heavy skeleton and when you add in then you know the organs, the blah blah and the muscle
24:06.180 - 24:11.860:  that would have made up this animal you get to a creature that is approaching about 200 tons.
24:12.380 - 24:17.140:  And what did this creature look like and how did it sustain itself given all this weight?
24:18.080 - 24:22.520:  Well it's quite interesting actually because it's it's not that I say not that long still long
24:22.520 - 24:28.220:  it's about 20 meters long but you know you find blue whales that are longer than that but just
24:28.480 - 24:33.800:  the nature of its skeleton and what that would have supported in terms of its bulk
24:34.460 - 24:39.680:  means that it was it was in the region of two to three times as heavy as an average blue whale.
24:40.020 - 24:46.440:  This creature we think probably occupied shallow waters in coastal zones and it was feeding
24:46.440 - 24:52.000:  on the bottom but also it would have had to have found a lot of food or certainly it would have
24:52.000 - 24:57.760:  had to have eaten for most of the day you know we we look at to say the you know the big dinosaurs
24:57.760 - 25:02.960:  the big saw reports you know from 100 million years ago they would have been eating you know
25:02.960 - 25:09.640:  20 21 hours a day and this creature too would have had to consume food on a vast scale.
25:09.960 - 25:15.660:  It's interesting isn't it that in this day and age we're still making such gigantic discoveries
25:15.660 - 25:20.920:  could there be more to come? Well there's always more to come what's interesting about the
25:20.920 - 25:26.760:  cessations the whales that their fossil record actually is pretty complete we have a very good
25:26.760 - 25:33.820:  picture of how whales first emerged about 55 million years ago and then evolved through to now.
25:34.540 - 25:39.240:  What's fascinating I find fascinating is that when you look at the skeletons of the history of
25:39.240 - 25:45.360:  whales gigantism I you know the large baleen whales the blue whales the humpbacks so those kinds
25:45.360 - 25:51.320:  of animals we think they got big only in the last five million years we've got some ideas for
25:51.320 - 25:58.460:  why that might have been but here is a creature 39 million years ago that was just as big and that
25:58.460 - 26:04.960:  is the surprise that's the fascination here is that today's great whales had just as colossal
26:04.960 - 26:11.780:  a cousin way back in time Jonathan Amos and finally let's go to the women's football world cup
26:11.780 - 26:16.640:  that's taking place in Australia and New Zealand. They have already been plenty of surprises
26:16.660 - 26:22.160:  in the tournament and there's been another shock result. One of the favourites Germany are out of
26:22.160 - 26:28.100:  the competition after they drew one all with South Korea. In the same group Morocco who are playing
26:28.100 - 26:33.940:  in their first world cup are through to the knockout stages after a one-nil victory over Colombia
26:34.320 - 26:41.080:  who also qualified. Our reporter in Australia Manijasmi said the Germany result is a massive setback
26:41.080 - 26:47.460:  for the two-time former world champions. The biggest shock in the history of this women's world cup
26:47.980 - 26:54.020:  and probably in the history of the world cup overall Germany who are ranked second in the world
26:54.020 - 26:59.860:  who won their first game six nil who are many people's favourites to win it have been knocked out
26:59.860 - 27:06.400:  at the end of the group stage they drew one one with South Korea but because Morocco beat Colombia
27:06.400 - 27:13.200:  one nil Germany finished third right so stunning result there and now we've got some big matches
27:13.200 - 27:18.780:  in store yes although who knows what's going to happen I mean the what we've seen we've seen
27:18.780 - 27:24.440:  Germany last year's European championship finalists go out before the last 16 but the knockout
27:24.440 - 27:31.420:  games start on Saturday and on Sunday Netherlands are playing South Africa who are in the knockout
27:31.420 - 27:37.420:  stages for the first time that game is actually a mid-day local time because FIFA the organizers
27:37.420 - 27:43.580:  expected the USA to have won their group and to play at that slot. Manijasmi in Sydney
27:45.440 - 27:49.700:  and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later
