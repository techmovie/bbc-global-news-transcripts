00:18.760 - 00:24.460:  podcast from the BBC World Service, where we try to help you make sense of the world around you,
00:24.640 - 00:28.880:  of the big things that are happening, the small things that are happening and everything in between.

00:37.060 - 00:39.780:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:42.300 - 00:46.920:  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Friday the 18th of August, these are our main stories.
00:47.600 - 00:54.260:  The BBC has been told that 1,400 people have starved to death in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray
00:54.260 - 01:00.440:  since international food aid were suspended in April. Russia has accused Ukraine of launching
01:00.440 - 01:07.020:  a drone attack on Moscow's business district. The growing power of China is expected to occupy the
01:07.020 - 01:11.900:  leaders of the United States, Japan and South Korea at a summit later today.
01:14.200 - 01:18.500:  Also in this podcast, I don't think I've had a second yet to think about the potential
01:18.500 - 01:24.140:  consequences here because if things don't turn for the better, I might lose my house in a couple
01:24.140 - 01:27.080:  of days time, but I haven't really had a chance to stop and think about that.
01:27.500 - 01:32.240:  People are evacuating the Canadian city of Yellowknife as wildfires close in,
01:32.280 - 01:37.840:  but summer yet to do so. And as we record this podcast, the deadline is less than five hours away.
01:41.620 - 01:47.320:  There was huge relief last year when the Ethiopian government and rebel fighters from the northern
01:47.320 - 01:52.680:  region of Tigray signed a peace deal. Thousands of people were killed and many more displaced
01:52.680 - 01:58.080:  during two years of fighting. Normally, the end of the conflict brings humanitarian relief,
01:58.080 - 02:05.240:  but now the BBC has been told that at least 1,400 Tigrayans have died from starvation in recent months
02:05.700 - 02:10.900:  because of a lack of food, although a senior official says the number of dead could be much higher.
02:11.540 - 02:14.120:  I spoke to our correspondent in the region, Mercy Juba.
02:14.740 - 02:19.700:  The situation in Tigray right now is difficult. I think that's the best word to describe it,
02:19.700 - 02:24.980:  because we have spoken to people and also just as seen what's happening in Tigray,
02:24.980 - 02:31.460:  of people going for days without food. They are not getting what can sustain them,
02:31.700 - 02:37.800:  and especially people who are in refugee camps, who are displaced by the two years of war,
02:37.800 - 02:42.380:  that they cannot even sustain themselves within the camps, that they have to go out and beg
02:42.380 - 02:46.300:  in the local markets for them to be able to feed themselves and their children.
02:46.360 - 02:53.960:  And what led to this is because after the two-year war, we heard the WFP and USAID coming in and
02:53.960 - 03:01.240:  just running to assist about 6 million Tigrayans to give them food aid and help them come back
03:01.240 - 03:05.340:  to their feet. But now, they announced a pause in food aid about three months ago,
03:05.860 - 03:09.500:  and since after they discovered that their donations were being stolen and divided,
03:09.520 - 03:15.020:  and a lot of people are being allegedly implicated in these Tigray food aids scandal.
03:15.660 - 03:19.900:  So right now, people are struggling to get by, and the local officials, they are quoting more
03:19.900 - 03:25.420:  than about 1,400 people dying in just about three regions, and this number does not include
03:25.420 - 03:33.060:  other regions that have not entirely, and as much as BBC can not independently verify this 1,400
03:33.060 - 03:36.840:  figure, we can see the impact of what's happening in Tigray.
03:37.180 - 03:43.260:  Mercy, many, many people are suffering because a few people allegedly stole this food supplies.
03:43.800 - 03:46.460:  When is this pause in the food aid going to end?
03:47.500 - 03:52.500:  So first of all, the pause happened three months ago, and we have been speaking to WFP,
03:52.500 - 03:57.280:  and what they are saying is that they are making plans to resume. They don't know when they
03:57.280 - 04:02.480:  will be resuming, but they want to resume at a point where they are fully confident that their
04:02.480 - 04:07.520:  systems will be able to be, you know, foolproof, and that the food Indonesia that they are giving
04:07.520 - 04:12.800:  will be able to reach the intended recipients. So we don't know really when that will happen.
04:13.340 - 04:18.080:  That was Mercy Juma. On the battlefield, air support is seen as
04:18.080 - 04:22.920:  critical to troops on the ground, and that's why ever since Russia invaded Ukraine last year,
04:23.320 - 04:27.600:  President Zelensky has been urging the West to provide his country with fighter jets.
04:28.340 - 04:34.240:  Well now, the transfer of F-16 jets could soon happen. The U.S. has said they'll move quickly
04:34.240 - 04:39.560:  to approve the transfer of the fighter jets when Ukrainian pilots are ready to fly them,
04:39.800 - 04:45.520:  and that training program was agreed back in May. Yurisak and advisor to Ukraine's Minister
04:45.520 - 04:51.780:  of Defence gave his reaction to the BBC. This is a very significant reassurance, acquiring
04:51.780 - 04:58.360:  a fourth generation aircraft, acquiring F-16s will make our skies more secure, and essentially,
04:58.360 - 05:03.280:  it will bring our victory closer. Earlier, I asked our correspondent James Waterhouse,
05:03.280 - 05:08.280:  who's in Kiev, if we know when Ukraine will get these jets. Well, if you ask Kiev,
05:08.280 - 05:12.700:  not this year, I think the downbeat assessment we had this week was that they weren't expecting
05:12.700 - 05:19.660:  to get them as early as the autumn or winter reason being, that even with this U.S. green light,
05:19.660 - 05:24.740:  which let's be frank, these F-16s will not arrive without. The U.S. is say so. Nevertheless,
05:24.740 - 05:30.740:  you have that pilot training program going on involving 11 countries, those aircraft,
05:30.740 - 05:35.560:  and all of the hardware needed, all of that support equipment and support staff will have to make
05:35.560 - 05:42.440:  their way over to Ukraine, and that equates to a time delay of several months. That is clear,
05:42.440 - 05:48.280:  and that is long been the frustration to Ukraine. Why? Well, as you said, it is Russia
05:48.280 - 05:53.340:  enjoying air superiority, not in the traditional sense where we see Russian jets roaming Ukrainian
05:53.340 - 05:59.140:  airspace, but there are more of them in the skies around occupied territories or inside Russia itself,
05:59.140 - 06:03.400:  where they are launching relentless missile attacks on Ukraine, as well as making
06:03.400 - 06:08.460:  incursions on the front line, and this is why it loops back to President Zelensky's repeated
06:08.460 - 06:13.580:  claim. It has not been a subtle messaging campaign, has it? Where he said, we need fighter jets,
06:13.580 - 06:18.760:  and we need them yesterday to unlock that. And I suppose analysts there are thinking it could
06:18.760 - 06:23.480:  be a game changer, but it depends on numbers, I suppose. It does depend on numbers. I mean,
06:23.480 - 06:27.380:  if we take the Netherlands, for example, one of the countries that has been given the green light
06:27.380 - 06:34.040:  to provide these F-16 fighter jets after training, it's about the models they have that are scheduled
06:34.040 - 06:39.100:  to be taken out of service. So with the Netherlands, we're talking about a couple of dozen roughly.
06:39.620 - 06:44.100:  So if you have 11 Western Allies, which form part of this green light from the US,
06:44.600 - 06:49.880:  then that could add up quite significantly, but they do need to arrive. Pilots do need to be competent,
06:49.880 - 06:55.020:  and then they rely completely different systems to the Soviet era mix that are used in Ukraine,
06:55.020 - 06:59.920:  and it also depends on Russian air defenses, but there is a concern that hasn't gone away here.
06:59.920 - 07:05.400:  The West has always been worried about an escalation with Russia, yet their confidence has grown,
07:05.400 - 07:10.020:  and we've seen an increase in military aid, but that concern is especially prevalent when we're
07:10.020 - 07:16.100:  talking about fighter jets, because take this scenario, say you have an American-made fighter jet
07:16.580 - 07:22.420:  flying in Ukrainian-occupied airspace, and it's engaged with an air defense system, and it targets
07:22.420 - 07:27.740:  that air defense system, which is on Russian territory, you then have a much more sizable
07:27.740 - 07:32.300:  Western intervention than you could argue with, say, an armored vehicle being driven over the front
07:32.300 - 07:37.840:  line. So there are those nerves, but there is clearly a direction of travel that Ukraine will
07:37.840 - 07:43.960:  welcome, despite its frustrations. Now as James Waterhouse, well as Ukraine waits for the fighter jets
07:43.960 - 07:50.640:  to arrive, Russia's defense ministry says its anti-aircraft systems have shot down a drone over
07:50.640 - 07:56.900:  the capital Moscow. Defense officials say Ukraine is responsible. Air traffic at Moscow's airports
07:56.900 - 08:01.360:  was also disrupted. More details from our correspondent Will Vernon in Moscow.
08:01.980 - 08:07.580:  The authorities say air defense systems shot down a drone in the west of the city center overnight.
08:07.920 - 08:14.880:  The statement claimed Ukraine was responsible. Video posted on social media shows an explosion
08:14.880 - 08:20.140:  near the Moscow City Business District, an area that's been attacked before. Today,
08:20.140 - 08:25.440:  a major exhibition center was damaged, although it's not clear whether this was caused by falling
08:25.440 - 08:31.840:  debris or whether the drone hit its target. Drone attacks in areas around Moscow are common.
08:32.240 - 08:37.180:  This incident took place just five kilometers from the Kremlin. That was Will Vernon.
08:38.400 - 08:44.280:  Back in May, the World Health Organization declared an end to COVID-19 as a global
08:44.280 - 08:49.260:  health emergency, but it did emphasize that coronavirus was still a threat.
08:50.180 - 08:55.820:  Now, the WHO has just announced that it's closely monitoring a new variant, which has been detected
08:55.820 - 09:02.400:  in Israel, Denmark, and the United States. Imogen folks in Geneva, where the WHO is based,
09:02.400 - 09:09.120:  doubly what we know. Not as much as the WHO would clearly like to know what it's been called,
09:09.120 - 09:19.740:  is BA2.86. Now, it could be a distant relative descendant of Omicron, but what is worrying
09:19.740 - 09:27.620:  the WHO and why they've classified it as a variant under monitoring is because it shows quite a
09:27.620 - 09:33.660:  lot of mutations. Some variants only show a couple. They're almost identical to their parent.
09:33.660 - 09:41.680:  If you like, this one not, and the more mutations and new variant shows, the more likely the
09:41.680 - 09:48.060:  way it affects a human being could change, the more likely, crucially, it could evade existing
09:48.060 - 09:53.900:  vaccines. Early days, though, not much sequencing going on, and that's part of the problem.
09:54.620 - 10:00.580:  So, close analysis before we know exactly what we're dealing with this variant.
10:01.480 - 10:06.320:  So, prudent to be cautious at the moment about this particular variant. What about the way
10:06.320 - 10:11.800:  countries are testing? A lot of them are stopped testing for coronavirus, haven't they? But what do
10:11.800 - 10:18.060:  we know about the impact or spread of the disease globally now? Well, we know that people are still
10:18.060 - 10:25.460:  dying, and there are still many, many, many cases. Unfortunately, some of the country's best
10:25.460 - 10:31.300:  resource to carry on with testing, tracing, and sequencing. And this is where you spot a new variant
10:32.060 - 10:37.980:  of relaxed those systems. And I think here in Geneva, there's a certain amount of frustration at
10:37.980 - 10:44.760:  WHO headquarters because it's this kind of taking your eye off the ball, which could allow
10:45.780 - 10:51.600:  not just COVID, but a new infectious disease to emerge, which could send us back to, well,
10:51.600 - 10:57.900:  hopefully not, but could send us back to all the rigors of 2020 and lockdowns. So, the WHO really
10:57.900 - 11:06.560:  would like countries to focus hard on testing people and analyzing new strains so that we know what
11:06.560 - 11:12.920:  we're dealing with. And also, in case we need a new vaccine for COVID, drug companies need to know
11:12.920 - 11:17.640:  what the new variant looks like exactly to make the vaccine as effective as possible.
11:18.380 - 11:25.620:  Imagine folks. Camp David, the country retreat of US Presidents, has a long track record of being
11:25.620 - 11:31.580:  the setting for historic foreign policy agreements. And later for the first time, President Biden is
11:31.580 - 11:37.280:  hosting both the Japanese and the South Korean Presidents there. So, what's brought these three
11:37.280 - 11:43.480:  leaders together? I spoke to our Asia Pacific Editor Michael Bristo. This is actually a major diplomatic
11:43.480 - 11:49.140:  event. United States, South Korea, Japan already allies, but essentially what is going to happen
11:49.140 - 11:54.360:  later today is they're going to deepen that alliance, agree to share more information on security,
11:55.480 - 12:00.500:  that kind of thing. A major moment, really, in the diplomatic history of these countries,
12:01.260 - 12:06.120:  brought about partly because President Biden has re-engaged America with its traditional allies
12:06.120 - 12:11.780:  after President Trump, but mostly because the leaders of both South Korea and Japan have decided
12:11.780 - 12:18.760:  to put the antagonism of a Japan's wartime aggression in Korea behind them and look to the future
12:18.760 - 12:23.600:  and particularly ahead, they see the growing power of China in East Asia and they want to come
12:23.600 - 12:29.420:  together to try and essentially do something about that. They know that on their own, they don't
12:29.420 - 12:35.440:  really stand a chance against China. So, they're re-engaging with each other and re-energizing their
12:35.440 - 12:40.120:  alliance. I think it's quite predictable, but what do China's views on this? Well, already they've
12:40.160 - 12:44.960:  shown their opposition, their annoyance to this kind of alliance. Foreign Minister spokesman
12:44.960 - 12:51.080:  today said, really, the Asia-Pacific region shouldn't be arresting ground for geopolitical rivalry.
12:51.080 - 12:56.840:  Essentially, China, from what it said and done over recent years, is itself as a growing power in
12:56.840 - 13:01.480:  the region. United States has the waning power and doesn't want something like this where
13:01.780 - 13:06.920:  countries coming together to form an alliance against themselves. And over recent weeks,
13:06.920 - 13:11.740:  they've become actually the Chinese quite desperate in trying to persuade South Korea and Japan
13:11.820 - 13:17.560:  not to engage with America in this way. This is what the Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a conference
13:17.560 - 13:25.540:  quite recently. American sealed visitors from China, South Korea and Japan as Asians. They
13:25.540 - 13:30.680:  can't tell the difference. No matter how yellow you dye your hair or how sharp you make your nose,
13:31.240 - 13:34.380:  you'll never turn into a westerner. You have to know your roots.
13:35.820 - 13:39.600:  Really quite strident comment there by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and there were
13:40.120 - 13:46.280:  understandably some accusations of racism, but on the diplomatic front, I think it's quite telling
13:46.280 - 13:51.640:  actually that it suggests to me that China's losing the argument if you have to appeal on racial
13:51.640 - 13:57.120:  grounds for countries to support you, then essentially you're not doing a very good job persuading
13:57.120 - 14:01.160:  you to support them because of the arguments. That was Michael Brister.
14:02.580 - 14:07.460:  A woman in South Africa who made headlines when she was jailed for kidnapping a baby
14:07.460 - 14:13.240:  Zephanie nurse and raising her as her own will be released on parole and placed under
14:13.240 - 14:20.680:  correctional supervision for three years. In 1997, Lovona Solomon abducted Zephanie from a hospital
14:20.680 - 14:26.220:  in Cape Town when she was just two days old, taking her from her sleeping mother's bedside.
14:26.220 - 14:32.400:  With a crime came to light in 2016, when Zephanie unknowingly made friends with her biological sister
14:32.920 - 14:38.160:  after their friends noticed the striking resemblance, the girls decided to take a DNA test
14:38.760 - 14:43.900:  which led to Solomon's arrest and imprisonment. She served seven years of her 10-year sentence.
14:44.680 - 14:49.000:  My colleague James Coppnell spoke to our correspondent in Johannesburg, Nomsa Maseca.
14:49.840 - 14:55.420:  The nurse family they have always celebrated Zephanie's birthday to commemorate it
14:56.080 - 15:01.900:  and when they did find out that she's still out there and she's alive and she lived just a few
15:01.900 - 15:08.020:  kilometers from their home, that was something else for them and that is why it's still making headlines
15:08.040 - 15:13.200:  here in South Africa with people beginning to ask questions about how many more children
15:13.860 - 15:17.560:  out there and not too far from their families where they were stolen from.
15:17.820 - 15:21.420:  So it is possible that there are other cases like this that happened in the news?
15:21.800 - 15:27.960:  Absolutely, particularly in the early 1990s when security was not as tight in hospital
15:27.960 - 15:33.780:  maternity or it's particularly where anyone who claims to be family was allowed to walk in and
15:33.820 - 15:40.340:  visit a mom and a baby and what are the chances most mothers at that time after they have given
15:40.340 - 15:43.620:  birth of course they exhausted their sleeping and the baby disappears.
15:44.040 - 15:47.620:  What happened do we know to Zephanie nurse in the subsequent years?
15:48.620 - 15:54.480:  Well Zephanie continued to live with Livona Solomon's husband because he raised her as his own
15:54.480 - 16:00.360:  even during the trial. It was very difficult for her to come to terms with the fact that the two
16:00.360 - 16:04.760:  people that raised her were actually not her biological parents but they raised her such
16:05.220 - 16:11.360:  but when the truth was revealed she has tried to build somewhat of a relationship with her
16:11.360 - 16:17.280:  biological parents and she has in the past said that relationship is going well but she's also
16:17.280 - 16:23.080:  spoken about Livona Solomon, the woman who raised her as her own and said that she's very happy
16:23.080 - 16:28.700:  that Livona is finally going to be released from prison and that she hopes that she will be
16:28.700 - 16:34.300:  rehabilitated so that she is able to move on with her life. Does the fact that Livona Solomon
16:34.900 - 16:40.060:  is going to get out on parole does that suggest that she has expressed remorse for what she did?
16:41.060 - 16:44.680:  You know from the beginning of the trial you know there were several lies that she told
16:44.680 - 16:49.720:  during the trial where she says she was also a victim of the circumstances because she claimed
16:49.720 - 16:55.620:  that she was given this baby at a train station and not that she actually went in and stole the baby
16:55.620 - 17:02.260:  herself but the judge at the time said you knew that this child was not yours. You had so many
17:02.260 - 17:08.640:  opportunities to take her to authorities and report this child as you found her as you claim. However
17:08.640 - 17:13.740:  you continued raising her so where's the remorse and also the fact that she pleaded not guilty
17:13.740 - 17:19.520:  to the charge also made the nurse family and of course the judge believe that she did not show
17:19.520 - 17:24.440:  any remorse. Nomsa Maseco in Johannesburg speaking to my colleague James Coppano.
17:27.020 - 17:32.260:  Still to come. Parmesan is one of the most counterfated cheeses and it's estimated that these
17:32.260 - 17:38.500:  knockoffs made two billion dollars in the last year alone. So could microchips stop the production
17:38.540 - 17:39.840:  of counterfeit cheeses.
17:46.260 - 17:49.300:  Wow what an experience to be a part of the Tokyo Olympics. It's so
17:49.300 - 17:52.760:  interesting I remember. It's one of the pinnacles of my athletic career.
17:53.060 - 17:58.320:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympic and Paralympic athletes share their remarkable stories
17:58.320 - 18:03.360:  from the struggles. Lots of sacrifices, lots of hard work, tears, a lot of things that
18:03.360 - 18:09.000:  outside world doesn't know. To the victories. In the wildfire I could do anything that
18:09.000 - 18:14.460:  anybody else could do. On the podium from the BBC World Service find it wherever you get your BBC
18:14.460 - 18:23.220:  podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Evacuating an entire city is a huge
18:23.220 - 18:28.180:  logistical challenge. The authorities and yellow knife in Canada's far north have the
18:28.180 - 18:34.060:  added problem of a raging wildfire bearing down on them. There are just two options. You
18:34.060 - 18:39.400:  can either fly out if you can get a flight or there's just one road out with safe evacuation
18:39.400 - 18:46.820:  centres hundreds of kilometres away. They've set a deadline of noon local time for the 20,000
18:46.820 - 18:53.000:  residents to get out and that's just four hours away or so as we record this. What's most
18:53.000 - 18:58.480:  residents are now fleeing their homes to nearby towns. Dr. Michelle Tumor from an organization
18:58.480 - 19:04.520:  called Veterinarians without borders is still in yellow knife for the moment. In yellow knife
19:04.520 - 19:09.420:  where the capital city of northwest territories we have a population of about 22,000 people
19:10.220 - 19:16.640:  and in our city there's only four veterinarians. I'm one of them. We have been working for the
19:16.640 - 19:23.860:  last few weeks on evacuation responses for animals in other nearby communities in the north
19:23.860 - 19:29.640:  west territories that have also been devastated with wildfires and now my hometown of yellow knife
19:29.640 - 19:36.680:  needs support and it was just a no-brainer that I needed to stay and help have people safely
19:36.680 - 19:42.020:  evacuate with their pets but then also help to take care of any pets that had to be left behind.
19:42.960 - 19:47.800:  What about those who've already left? Oli Williams is a journalist from yellow knife who
19:47.800 - 19:53.620:  evacuated the city on Wednesday and is now in Fort Simpson. People have been leaving since yesterday
19:53.620 - 19:58.000:  evening. Some people left even before the evacuation order was declared. They saw the
19:58.000 - 20:03.200:  writing on the wall. They realised that this looked like a relatively bleak situation and they
20:03.200 - 20:08.100:  got themselves on the road. I was one of those to be frank with you. About 12, 13 hours before
20:08.100 - 20:12.640:  the evacuation order was declared. I left the city because I think some of us have concluded that
20:13.140 - 20:17.420:  this situation was starting to look beyond the control of the authorities and that of course
20:17.420 - 20:23.460:  has now proved to be the case and about 20,000 people are being told they've got to get out of the
20:23.460 - 20:30.220:  city and get south to safety. There is only one road south and it's not a very big road either. It's
20:30.220 - 20:35.540:  one lane in each direction so thousands of people have got to fit down that road. There is one petrol
20:35.540 - 20:40.200:  station worth talking about between yellow knife and alberto, the province to the south which
20:40.520 - 20:44.500:  represents safety. People have been getting in their cars. They've been packing up and I'll be
20:44.500 - 20:50.020:  honest with you. They've been in relatively good and ordered spirits about it so far and I'm
20:50.020 - 20:55.740:  touching word here. I'm fingers crossed and I hope for the best. So far this evacuation has
20:55.740 - 21:01.200:  proceeded by road. I think about as well as it could have done. As I say, there's one petrol
21:01.200 - 21:05.720:  station there. It hasn't run out of fuel. They've kept refueling that again and again and again
21:05.720 - 21:09.680:  there are line-ups kilometers long to get through that because it's such a long drive
21:09.680 - 21:14.900:  but it's going okay. There haven't been any major accidents as you can imagine. All it would take
21:14.900 - 21:20.380:  is one. The road will be closed. I don't know what we do then. So far so good on that front. The
21:20.380 - 21:26.040:  air lift is a different story. They didn't get the air lift going in time this morning because of
21:26.040 - 21:30.480:  weather issues. So they didn't get as many flights out the doors. They wanted to. Now they've
21:30.480 - 21:34.920:  got to make up for that tomorrow. They didn't get a flight out from the hospital today to get all
21:34.920 - 21:39.200:  the patients out safely the way they hope. Now they've got to get that done tomorrow. The clock's
21:39.200 - 21:43.580:  ticking. I don't think I've had a second yet to think about the potential consequences here
21:44.180 - 21:49.000:  because if things don't turn for the better, I might lose my house in a couple of days time but
21:49.000 - 21:54.080:  I haven't really had a chance to stop and think about that. There has never been an evacuation on
21:54.080 - 21:59.980:  this scale in the northwest territories. Very, very rarely has there been an evacuation on this
21:59.980 - 22:06.560:  scale in Canada. We are facing a critical 24 to 48 hours. Absolutely. We are. Oli Williams.
22:07.320 - 22:12.720:  Well, as the wildfires in Canada rage on across the Pacific to the west on the Hawaiian
22:12.720 - 22:17.880:  island of Maui, the devastation caused by the wildfires there is starting to have more widespread
22:17.880 - 22:22.940:  ramifications. The head of the emergency management agency for the island has resigned
22:22.940 - 22:28.300:  following criticism that the agency did not sound sirens during the wildfires last week,
22:28.300 - 22:34.980:  which have left 111 people dead and a thousand missing. Herman and Dyer defended the decision
22:34.980 - 22:41.320:  not to use the sirens because of their usual use to warn of incoming tsunamis and that may
22:41.320 - 22:47.120:  of course people to run towards the fires. Our North America correspondent Sophie Long sent this
22:47.120 - 22:53.880:  update from the island. On Wednesday, the head of Maui's emergency management agency defended
22:53.880 - 22:59.640:  the decision not to sound those sirens. He said that people could have gone malker. Now malker is
22:59.640 - 23:04.780:  a Hawaiian directional term that means into the mountains or inland. He was implying that people
23:04.780 - 23:08.560:  may have been panicked and gone in the wrong direction. Well, you'll find very few people
23:08.560 - 23:14.300:  here in Maui who will agree with that. And today, Thursday, still Thursday here in Maui,
23:14.580 - 23:19.620:  the same man, Herman and Dyer resigned. Now, the only reason he gave for that resignation were
23:19.620 - 23:25.260:  and specified health reasons. But of course, it comes just 24 hours after he defended that decision
23:25.680 - 23:30.880:  not to sound the sirens. And this comes while the search and recovery effort is still ongoing.
23:30.880 - 23:38.260:  The search and recovery teams have now recovered 111 bodies. Only six of those have been identified.
23:38.260 - 23:43.560:  So it's still in its early phases, really. A mobile malk has arrived in Maui with extra coroners
23:43.840 - 23:48.760:  to help with the painstaking task of identifying those who lost their lives. Sophie Long.
23:50.020 - 23:56.320:  Ecuador was once widely regarded as a safe, friendly travel destination, a stable nation with a
23:56.320 - 24:02.300:  functioning political system. Now, it has become the most murderous in South America.
24:02.900 - 24:07.680:  Ecuadorians go to the polls this weekend in the first round of presidential elections.
24:07.680 - 24:14.380:  A last week a candidate was shot dead, which sent shockwaves through a nation that was once peaceful
24:14.380 - 24:20.180:  but in the past few years has seen a huge rise in violence because of drug trafficking and organized
24:20.180 - 24:25.260:  crime. Our South America correspondent Katie Watson sent this report from Guayaquil.
24:28.460 - 24:34.520:  Out on patrol in Ecuador's biggest city, Guayaquil is home to the country's largest port.
24:34.520 - 24:39.980:  It's a key part of the lucrative drugs routes and now the epicenter of violent crime.
24:41.940 - 24:47.580:  Curfews about to kick in in Durán, an industrial part of the city, overrun by traffickers.
24:50.760 - 24:56.020:  Police set up checkpoints, patting drivers down and using a flashlight to check for drugs and
24:56.020 - 25:02.820:  weapons inside vehicles. Some offices are so scared of reprisals by gangs, they cover their faces
25:02.820 - 25:08.860:  with black balaclavas. Captain Victor Caspar Valencia is head of tonight's operation.
25:11.680 - 25:17.480:  Gangs want to win territory. We're dealing with very violent deaths. People being found hanging
25:17.480 - 25:23.760:  from bridges or caught into pieces. International criminal organizations are recruiting people here
25:24.380 - 25:29.640:  but they have lots of money. There's a totally balanced between organized crime and the police
25:29.640 - 25:37.600:  trying to stop it. Mexican and Colombian cartels have infiltrated local gangs as they
25:37.600 - 25:43.380:  vie for domination of the cocaine trade. Ecuador was hit hard by Covid and they've taken
25:43.380 - 25:50.440:  advantage of a country broken by a pandemic and by corrupt politics. We just stopped and the
25:50.440 - 25:53.640:  police have got out and they're doing another operation. Basically checking cars they go along
25:53.700 - 26:01.220:  and I've just been told that we're at an important area where on the one side there's particularly gang
26:01.220 - 26:06.760:  the Latin kings and on the other side gangs including Lostraneros, there are several but
26:06.760 - 26:15.480:  basically this is a turf war along this road. As the campaign draws to a close ahead of this
26:15.480 - 26:24.980:  weekend's elections crime is top of the agenda. The words peace and security are repeated at
26:24.980 - 26:30.720:  candidate Daniel Noboa's closing campaign. Organizers know that will chime with Ecuadorians
26:31.160 - 26:36.320:  still in shock after Fernando Villa Vicencio's murder last week. We live in an unsafe society.
26:37.220 - 26:43.460:  We have to do campaign even with our wooded proof vest so that is a very negative sign. I think
26:43.460 - 26:48.740:  that we need to also work on a social side and problem is that by not giving people opportunities
26:48.740 - 26:58.480:  we're feeding these organizations with young new members. But parading through drug trafficking
26:58.480 - 27:05.000:  territory carries big risks. Shortly after our interview a nearby shootout brought a halt to the rally.
27:08.720 - 27:14.200:  Chaos filmed on social media Daniel Noboa's team left shelter in the campaign track.
27:17.780 - 27:22.120:  These elections were called early after the current leader dissolved the national assembly
27:22.120 - 27:27.540:  to avoid an impeachment vote. The chaotic politics in this country makes solving Ecuador's
27:27.700 - 27:32.540:  problems a challenge but the crisis is one that goes far beyond Ecuador's control.
27:35.500 - 27:41.220:  As long as demand for cocaine keeps soaring the cartels will fight for domination and the
27:41.220 - 27:47.220:  body count will keep rising. That was Katie Watson reporting from Ecuador.
27:49.380 - 27:56.480:  Seductress vamp a woman of easy virtue. They're uncomfortable words to say and offensive obviously
27:56.480 - 28:02.260:  to many people and I've said them because they're all words that judges in India have been able
28:02.260 - 28:08.680:  to use up until now in their written judgments and in the courtroom. But this is all set to change
28:08.680 - 28:15.680:  as they've been handed a new guidebook which details a list of 40 words to avoid when describing
28:15.680 - 28:22.620:  women. I spoke to our correspondent Divya Arya in Delhi. One would assume that they would not be
28:22.620 - 28:29.200:  part of ordinary life or especially judicial pronouncements but they have been in fact I've
28:29.200 - 28:35.700:  reported extensively on judgments that stereotype women using such words and this is exactly what
28:35.700 - 28:42.160:  the handbook is saying that in some cases stereotypes about women in terms of their character in
28:42.160 - 28:47.480:  terms of how they should behave especially in the context of sexual violence in the context of
28:47.480 - 28:53.640:  domestic violence. Those stereotypes are absorbed by judges and lawyers as much as by general
28:53.640 - 29:00.240:  society and if we don't call them out they either end up impacting outcomes that is judgments
29:00.300 - 29:07.180:  or even the way the judgments are pronounced by just reinforcing those stereotypes. So it has a
29:07.180 - 29:15.360:  glossary of of 40 words as you said and just to give you a flavor some of the recommendations
29:15.420 - 29:23.880:  in those words are like seductress, slut, whore, all of these words should just be replaced by
29:23.880 - 29:30.340:  women or Indian women, Western women should be replaced by women or women of loose morals,
29:30.340 - 29:36.500:  chased women, career women should all be replaced by just women because these are all attributes
29:36.500 - 29:42.380:  that are being associated with them. Another thing that it suggests is things like ravished should
29:42.380 - 29:50.840:  just be replaced by assaulted because it suggests certain aspect of how assault happens from a
29:50.840 - 29:56.080:  perspective or for man in terms of enjoyment and not really violence which is the prison from which
29:56.080 - 30:01.540:  it should be viewed. Similarly the use of the term violated which indicates that when a woman is
30:01.540 - 30:07.100:  raped her owner is violated she's demeaned in a certain way and it says that violated should
30:07.100 - 30:13.420:  again be replaced by neutral terms like assaulted injury. That was Divya Arya in Delhi.
30:14.620 - 30:19.780:  Now as a good male often ends with a cheese course so today's podcast ends with a cheese story.
30:19.780 - 30:26.640:  Parmesan is one of the world's most famous but for it to be truly called parmesan it has to be
30:26.640 - 30:32.640:  made in Italy and under certain conditions and now cheese makers in Italy are turning to the world
30:32.640 - 30:38.840:  of tech in order to protect their precious cheese brand. A new microchip is being trialled in the
30:38.840 - 30:44.440:  north of the country all with the aim of stamping out a rise in fakes. The newsroom's
30:44.440 - 30:50.960:  carous pavement reports. The process of making parmesan cheese is a craft that dates back to the
30:50.960 - 30:56.220:  middle ages and this technique has been protected ever since thanks to strict European guidelines.
30:56.440 - 31:02.940:  These states that a cheese can only be classed as true parmesan or regiano if it is made in a
31:03.060 - 31:08.080:  specific region in northern Italy. It's matured for 12 months and a team of experts have given
31:08.080 - 31:13.780:  their seal of approval. However this system is being threatened by fakes which have stormed the
31:13.780 - 31:19.320:  market. In fact parmesan is one of the most counterfated cheeses and it's estimated that these
31:19.320 - 31:24.480:  knockoffs made two billion dollars in the last year alone. A figure that's not too far off the
31:24.480 - 31:30.120:  real version which made just under 2.4 billion. So how can you make sure you're buying the real deal?
31:30.280 - 31:35.220:  Parmesan producers have turned to the world of tech and are testing a new microchip.
31:35.260 - 31:41.220:  The same size as a grain of salt, it's inserted into the waxy Rand on the outside and consumers
31:41.220 - 31:46.560:  will be able to scan and see exactly where their cheeses come from. Its placement on the wheel
31:46.560 - 31:52.040:  means it's unlikely to be eaten but the chip is food safe and can sit in stomach acid for weeks
31:52.040 - 31:57.640:  without leaking any harmful substances. It's thought that these cheesy chips could pave the way
31:57.640 - 32:02.980:  for a whole new form of product verification as the same technology could be used in livestock,
32:02.980 - 32:09.760:  car parts and drug authentication. But for now we'll have to wait and see how the 120 000
32:09.760 - 32:14.720:  chipped parmesan wheels fare in this trial and whether they'll be able to grate out the fraudsters.
32:15.460 - 32:16.500:  That was Karen's maidment.
32:19.820 - 32:24.200:  And that's all from us for now but before we go here's Jackie with news of the next happy
32:24.200 - 32:29.720:  port. Yes, in this edition the director determined to improve the representation of disabled people
