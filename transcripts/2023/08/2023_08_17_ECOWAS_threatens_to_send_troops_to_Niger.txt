00:11.680 - 00:17.880:  by advertising. I was working in a coffee shop in Boston to help pay rent while I was training
00:17.880 - 00:21.580:  for the trials and so people kept joking and they were like, oh yeah, she just took a two-hour coffee
00:21.580 - 00:27.580:  break and went and ran the Olympic trials bare at that. On the podium is back with more Olympians
00:27.580 - 00:32.980:  and Paralympians sharing their journeys to the top. On the podium from the BBC World Service,
00:32.980 - 00:40.660:  listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:42.780 - 00:47.720:  I'm Nick Miles and at 13 hours GMT on Thursday the 17th of August, these are our main stories.
00:48.500 - 00:53.860:  West African military chiefs have met to discuss possible armed intervention in Niger
00:53.860 - 00:59.980:  following last month's coup. The capital of Canada's northwest territories is being evacuated
00:59.980 - 01:06.060:  in the face of an approaching wildfire. Pakistani authorities have banned public gatherings in the
01:06.100 - 01:11.280:  city of Ajaranwala after at least four churches were burned by Muslim crowds.
01:13.600 - 01:20.300:  Also in this podcast, the first sports teams to leave North Korea since the COVID pandemic and
01:20.540 - 01:26.420:  individual mushroom is beautiful and a bunch of these growing together are if lots of them
01:26.420 - 01:30.660:  it would be quite magical. Why do mushrooms go green in the dark?
01:34.560 - 01:40.640:  We are still giving diplomacy a chance, but if that fails, our forces are ready to go into Niger.
01:41.520 - 01:46.720:  That's the head of the regional security block, Echoos, making it quite clear that the new
01:46.720 - 01:52.880:  military leaders in Niger will not get away with last month's coup. The commissioner for peace and
01:52.880 - 01:57.700:  security Abdel Fatal Musa warned the junta would be held to account for their actions.
02:17.660 - 02:21.060:  Our correspondent Thomas Naadi is in the Ghanaian capital Acra.
02:21.480 - 02:26.980:  We are gradually getting closer to an armed intervention speaker after speaker at this particular
02:27.400 - 02:33.520:  conference emphasized the fact that they are determined to restore constitutional rule in Niger.
02:33.780 - 02:41.080:  And they said that everything is ready. They are just framing up their strategy as to when and
02:41.080 - 02:48.160:  how to possibly enter Niger. So we know that Echoos is split over this, but you're saying that
02:48.160 - 02:52.460:  it could well be that just a certain portion of Echoos goes in with their troops.
02:53.740 - 02:59.720:  Yeah, it's just a few Echoos member countries who are unwilling to be part of this,
03:00.600 - 03:06.620:  but the majority of members of the block are supporting this and they are contributing troops.
03:06.620 - 03:13.700:  We know that Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea have opposed the invasion and we also know that
03:13.700 - 03:18.740:  they are under military rule and of course, they are no longer part of the ban from the organization.
03:18.780 - 03:25.060:  And then one other tiny African country is not willing to take part in this, but what are
03:25.060 - 03:29.500:  part from that? All member countries are ready and willing to contribute troops
03:29.500 - 03:34.840:  for this particular invasion. In most of these countries and places like Ghana for instance,
03:34.840 - 03:39.580:  there's ongoing debate as to whether Ghana soldiers should take part in this.
03:39.860 - 03:44.100:  Okay, well, we're not there yet. So always. So they're saying, we just heard them say there that
03:44.540 - 03:50.620:  there's a diplomacy to be played out. What's the likely reaction from Niger, the leader's there?
03:51.440 - 03:58.240:  Well, diplomacy appears to be filtering. Now, the Nijanta in Niger is a beginning to give
03:58.240 - 04:05.360:  diplomacy a chance. It's made it official. The new elected prime minister has said that
04:05.820 - 04:12.580:  they are in a transition period and they will welcome the negotiations or diplomatic officials
04:12.580 - 04:19.520:  into that country. But we know that previously they rejected this. So why now? And it's most likely
04:19.520 - 04:27.280:  because of the threat of the use of force in Niger. Thomas Nautida, get out of town before the weekend
04:27.280 - 04:32.820:  that is the message given to the 20,000 residents of Yellowknife, one of the largest cities in
04:32.820 - 04:37.680:  Canada's far north, who've been told that they're in the direct path of fires that are burning
04:37.680 - 04:43.620:  out of control. Well, the major issue is that there's only one road out and that is through the fires.
04:44.940 - 04:49.260:  In the middle of the night in Canada, Bob Zimmer, the shadow minister for the region,
04:49.260 - 04:55.520:  urged families to get to safety. If you're in Yellowknife, I've actually been speaking to some
04:55.520 - 05:00.180:  locals about the situation and we want you to be safe. Make sure you take care of your families
05:00.180 - 05:06.340:  and get them to safety. We'll be watching this situation closely. But most of all, be safe out there.
05:07.100 - 05:11.060:  So a real sense of urgency now. Our reporter Stephanie Prentice gave me an update.
05:11.720 - 05:16.900:  It is dramatic and it is a fast moving situation. We know that order to leave Yellowknife was given
05:16.900 - 05:21.980:  out Wednesday evening, telling residents living close the fires that's in the West in no uncertain
05:21.980 - 05:27.260:  terms to evacuate immediately and giving Friday at noon as the last possible time the whole
05:27.260 - 05:32.020:  community may be able to get out safely. Now, this is because those fires that have been burning
05:32.020 - 05:36.420:  up north and close to Yellowknife, they've been more ferocious than authorities have been
05:36.420 - 05:41.240:  expecting and natural and man-made fire breaks aren't doing anything. They're just going over them,
05:41.240 - 05:46.200:  going through them. So for those families who are now grabbing their belongings, packing up their
05:46.200 - 05:51.500:  homes, potentially saying goodbye to those homes forever, there is that other obstacle you mentioned.
05:51.500 - 05:57.380:  There are two clear paths out of this situation. One is a flight, the other is a highway,
05:57.840 - 06:02.680:  and that highway runs through the main fire that's burning. So the advice that's been given is
06:02.680 - 06:08.240:  the road is closing intermittently. The advice is just get out when you can. Jets are also being
06:08.240 - 06:12.360:  deployed alongside commercial flights. That's to get people out that are vulnerable, that are older,
06:12.360 - 06:15.780:  that can't flee and might be unable generally to escape.
06:16.800 - 06:21.360:  And this is both the most dramatic of a number of different wildfires that have been raging.
06:21.820 - 06:25.040:  I don't know if in several months now I remember a few months ago we were talking about the first
06:25.040 - 06:29.920:  of these in Nova Scotia out east. It's been a particularly severe season for fires, hasn't it?
06:30.540 - 06:35.660:  Yes, we know that Canada has an annual wildfire season but this is being described as
06:35.660 - 06:40.460:  it's worst and that's because these fires are wilder, they're harder to get onto control,
06:40.460 - 06:44.740:  they're moving closer to communities in infrastructure than expected.
06:45.300 - 06:49.700:  And officials are saying they're moving unpredictably at greater speeds and that's why for safety,
06:49.700 - 06:55.320:  they want every single resident out. Now recent estimates do say that around a thousand fires
06:55.320 - 07:01.520:  are burning in the country and Yellowknife is the 9th NWT north-west territory to get that
07:01.520 - 07:06.360:  evacuation order and quickly for context. Another of those communities it's called Hey River,
07:06.360 - 07:10.980:  they were told to evacuate last week. Residents told stories of driving through
07:10.980 - 07:16.560:  embers, their vehicles melting around them, windows cracking through heat and of driving through
07:16.560 - 07:21.980:  that dense orange haze we've been seeing in Canada recently. So these stories of fleeing and how
07:21.980 - 07:26.240:  hard it can be, show what could happen to those Yellowknife residents even if they leave
07:26.240 - 07:32.520:  within that safe evacuation window. Stephanie Prentice, let's stay with devastating wildfires now
07:32.520 - 07:36.620:  because President Biden says that he's going to travel to Hawaii next week
07:36.620 - 07:42.900:  to inspect the places affected on Maui. He's been criticized by his political opponents who said
07:42.900 - 07:48.260:  that he's been too slow to see the devastation for himself. So far, officials have confirmed
07:48.260 - 07:53.380:  that more than 100 people have died in the fires. Josh Green is the governor of Hawaii.
07:53.820 - 07:59.760:  We're just a little bit more heartbroken because we do have to report that more of our loved ones
07:59.760 - 08:06.620:  have been confirmed, lost and deceased. 110 individuals have been confirmed deceased.
08:07.340 - 08:12.480:  We'll get some details about this from our distinguished leaders and police and fire
08:12.480 - 08:19.980:  a 38% of the territory has been covered. Lance is a resident of the worst affected town Lahaina
08:20.500 - 08:25.900:  and he spoke to my colleague Victoria Wankunda about what happened to him and his family the day
08:25.900 - 08:32.100:  fires swept through his hometown. After fleeing, he saw his house on the news and golfed in flames.
08:32.920 - 08:38.400:  I wish I had taken more. If I could go back and you give me 30 seconds, I can take so much more
08:38.400 - 08:45.540:  things that I value. Just the pictures, the memories of my children, my like important documents
08:45.540 - 08:53.460:  that I left at home. I'm a prior military. I was in the Air Force for six years. I got a new
08:53.460 - 08:58.820:  boarder on the way. I just wish I had taken all the supplies that we had been
08:59.540 - 09:04.640:  piling up in his nursery. A lot of things that we had bought prior waiting for his arrival
09:04.940 - 09:10.660:  and you know, everything is kind of gone. But I just wish I had taken more from my kids and my
09:10.660 - 09:17.920:  family. That's all. How is it flaying your home, seeing your home go up in flames when
09:18.620 - 09:25.640:  you have a wife who is expecting? It's terrifying. When I finally left the house, it wasn't on fire
09:25.640 - 09:33.200:  yet. But I could see the fire across the highway of the street above our house. It was kind of like
09:33.200 - 09:39.880:  a realization. It was so close. I've never seen fire this close before. I had to make sure that
09:39.880 - 09:46.100:  they left for safety. You know, we just wanted them, everyone to get to safety like the women and
09:46.100 - 09:53.260:  children. And then the evacuation center had to get evacuated because the fire was so close
09:53.260 - 10:01.020:  to that area. You know, that's how fast it moves. Sorry, I'm just trying to compose myself.
10:01.880 - 10:08.380:  Take your time. You know, unfortunately, we've got a big family. A lot of people that care about us,
10:08.480 - 10:19.740:  but there's so much people out there missing glass. Us, you know, they don't have their love
10:19.740 - 10:31.800:  box. People I know, people that are in my life were one of the lucky ones. You know, I was running
10:31.800 - 10:39.220:  down front street. I actually, when they evacuated the first time my family, we parked our cars
10:39.220 - 10:46.200:  and me and my brother were kind of like, we have to go home to get our dogs. So we drove back. We
10:46.200 - 10:53.520:  were driving back with a wall of orange surrounding us. And when we got to the ending, the north
10:53.520 - 11:00.940:  ending of front street, we just realized how bad everything had gone and the flames were already
11:02.020 - 11:06.580:  lighting up houses on that end of front street. It jumped the road already at this point.
11:07.720 - 11:13.660:  I just looked at them. I said, you know, we got to start running. And so we ran from that beach
11:13.660 - 11:19.780:  park to my house. It's maybe a quarter of a mile running on front street. I passed by houses of
11:19.780 - 11:28.540:  people I know. Tigre is a chef that I used to work at Mall of Ocean, Tavern with. I saw his
11:28.540 - 11:35.340:  house in flames. I saw one of our family friends, his house in flames. And he came to her house
11:35.340 - 11:45.640:  with some fire. And I just cried. I just cried. As we ran, it was so hard to process. We got there.
11:45.680 - 11:52.560:  And as soon as I passed my mailbox, I was screaming for my dogs. And I'm sure enough they came out.
11:52.900 - 11:59.600:  You know, they were waiting. You couldn't go anywhere. It was all a blur. You look in the rear
11:59.600 - 12:06.360:  view and the sky is just a little red and orange. It was so terrifying. It's never going to be the same.
12:07.300 - 12:11.680:  I want it back. I need to go back there. I want to hand it back.
12:12.620 - 12:20.620:  That was a residence of Maui there. Now, to Pakistan, where we've been bringing you news of
12:20.620 - 12:26.080:  the terrible violence after two Christian men were accused of desecrating pages of the Quran.
12:27.060 - 12:31.460:  Well, the police are now guarding a Christian neighborhood in the province of Punjab after hundreds
12:31.460 - 12:37.540:  of Muslim men attacked the area. The violence broke out in the city of Jaran Wala and five churches
12:37.540 - 12:43.420:  were touched. The most reverend doctor Azad Marshall is president of Pakistan's National
12:43.420 - 12:48.280:  Council of Churches. And he told the BBC that these mobs were intent on stoking unrest.
12:48.280 - 12:55.880:  That's very sad and shocking because Christian community is peaceful community and they're
12:55.880 - 13:03.980:  minding their own business and they are not the ones who will commit crimes like desecrating
13:03.980 - 13:14.080:  the Quran. There is no real clear evidence. I believe it is really made up claim and just to
13:14.080 - 13:20.620:  create disturbance. Well, all public gatherings in Jaran Wala have now been banned for seven days.
13:20.700 - 13:26.060:  Our correspondent Caroline Davies is at the scene of the attacks. We're in the Christian quarter
13:26.060 - 13:30.160:  of Jaran Wala and you can see the level of destruction. All of these items are things that have been
13:30.160 - 13:35.140:  taken from inside the homes of Christians in this community brought outside and burnt. That's
13:35.500 - 13:39.860:  according to what the authorities have told us. There are fans, there are chairs, there are beds,
13:40.420 - 13:47.300:  fridges, any items that people could get hold of. Now we understand that this is all a reaction
13:47.300 - 13:53.200:  because there were accusations that two Christian men had damaged the Quran, had torn pages
13:53.600 - 13:59.000:  and desecrated the Quran and that this was a response people gathered together in anger and
13:59.000 - 14:03.400:  then came out and we've talked to people from some of the homes nearby talking about the fear
14:03.400 - 14:07.540:  when they started hearing of people coming towards them of attacks imminent that they gathered
14:07.540 - 14:11.740:  their children together and then ran away as quickly as possible. It's John's Church which is
14:12.160 - 14:17.340:  a Catholic Church. The walls are completely blackened from the smoke and from the items that
14:17.340 - 14:22.780:  were burnt here. All that is left inside is there are the remains of the of the altar,
14:24.400 - 14:29.740:  a few tables that have been blackened as well but this is just one part of the devastation. We know
14:29.740 - 14:34.440:  that there have been at least four churches that have been damaged. Now according to the authorities
14:34.440 - 14:41.000:  they've arrested over 100 people because of this damage in relation to this damage but we know
14:41.000 - 14:45.000:  that the two individuals, the two Christians that have been accused of having desecrated the
14:45.000 - 14:50.740:  Quran have so far not been arrested. Caroline Davis, two green buses have been spotted
14:50.740 - 14:57.020:  crossing the river that divides North Korea and China. A small event maybe but a huge moment for
14:57.020 - 15:02.260:  the country and its journey with the coronavirus. On board I believe to have been members of a
15:02.260 - 15:08.540:  North Korean Taekwondo team on their way to a competition. Pyongyang sealed itself off from
15:08.540 - 15:14.960:  all trade and diplomatic ties in early 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The BBC's Michael
15:14.960 - 15:20.340:  Bristow told me more about this Taekwondo team. North Korea doesn't give official announcements
15:20.340 - 15:25.600:  often on all kinds of things but this team have been observed as you mentioned there crossing the
15:25.600 - 15:31.220:  border to Dandong which is a city on the border with North Korea, Chinese city either then got on a
15:31.280 - 15:36.800:  train, an overnight train and went to Beijing where there were again spotted traveling on buses
15:36.800 - 15:43.140:  which belonged to the North Korean Embassy. It's assumed that this is a Taekwondo team on their way
15:43.140 - 15:49.060:  to Astana which is a capital of Kazakhstan where there's international world Taekwondo
15:49.060 - 15:55.060:  championships taking place this weekend. So that's what we know and as you indicated there in your
15:55.060 - 16:01.660:  introduction it's a sign that after strict COVID restrictions being sealed off from the rest of the
16:01.660 - 16:08.240:  world North Korea is slowly, slowly opening up. Michael I understand that cross-border freight trains
16:08.240 - 16:14.480:  between North Korea and China started again last year so goods have been coming in and getting out
16:14.480 - 16:18.600:  of the country particularly food because it was a real concern wasn't there during the pandemic
16:18.600 - 16:24.560:  that there were sort of starvation and real lack of food during the pandemic and real problems
16:24.560 - 16:31.680:  there. What is the overall situation now in terms of North Korea's attitude to the pandemic and COVID,
16:31.680 - 16:38.360:  how is it dealing with it? Well no country in the world closed itself off quite as much as North
16:38.360 - 16:45.720:  Korea's did and you indicated there a freight train between trains between China and North Korea
16:45.720 - 16:51.840:  resumed last year and slowly they were opening up earlier just to give you an example of how closed
16:51.840 - 16:58.660:  off it was. North Korea's biggest ally China didn't even have its ambassador in North Korea until
16:58.660 - 17:04.760:  March this year the North Koreans gave the Chinese special dispensation to send their ambassador so
17:04.760 - 17:09.700:  that gives you an example of its greatest ally can't get its ambassador in that show you how closed
17:09.700 - 17:17.940:  off it was. Last month there was a parade to mark the end of the fighting in the Korean war and
17:17.940 - 17:23.520:  a Chinese and Russian delegation went there so that's another indication that it's opening up
17:23.520 - 17:30.260:  this Taekwondo team is yet another signal so North Korea will open up slowly and that will only
17:30.760 - 17:36.240:  help the economy now help the country reintegrate to a certain extent with the international community.
17:37.100 - 17:44.680:  Michael Bristow. Still to come in this podcast she lined us up in front of the class and hit our
17:44.680 - 17:51.840:  palms with a plastic ruler one by one. Why some in South Korea still want to see teachers fight back.
17:58.120 - 18:02.700:  What in the world is the podcast exploring the stories and the issues that you need to know about?
18:02.700 - 18:10.280:  93% of fast fashion workers aren't getting paid a living wage. The former president is accused of
18:10.320 - 18:15.900:  trying to overturn democracy. How do we lead athletes train in and around their menstrual cycle?
18:15.900 - 18:20.620:  Understand more, feel better with what in the world from the BBC World Service.

18:28.700 - 18:34.880:  Welcome back. It is the stuff of heist films and best selling fiction, the theft of priceless
18:34.880 - 18:40.420:  jewelry from the British Museum in London. We gave you details in our earlier podcast of the
18:40.420 - 18:47.700:  robbery of items including gemstones dating back to 1500 BC from the museum's vaults. A member of
18:47.700 - 18:54.320:  staff has been arrested. George Osborne, chairman of the museum, said the theft which was discovered
18:54.320 - 19:00.420:  earlier this year was a sad day for all who love our British Museum and the staff would do whatever
19:00.420 - 19:07.340:  it takes to improve security. Christopher Maranello is a lawyer and founder of Art Recovery International
19:07.460 - 19:12.140:  specializing in recovering stolen art and artifacts. He spoke to Simon Jack.
19:12.860 - 19:17.460:  Well, it happens every single day around the world. What's shocking is that it's happened
19:17.460 - 19:21.940:  to the British Museum, one of the most important and well-funded museums in the world.
19:22.920 - 19:27.340:  Would they put out feel as to somebody like you and say keep your eyes peeled for various stolen
19:27.340 - 19:34.540:  artifacts? Well, I would hope so. I mean, historically we have been notified once there is a
19:34.540 - 19:39.460:  list of objects that have been stolen. That should be the priority at this point is preparing
19:39.580 - 19:46.300:  an inventory and comparing it with a previous inventory to find out what exactly is missing and
19:46.300 - 19:54.460:  then get those objects listed on various databases, private, public, interpol so that the art market
19:54.460 - 20:01.040:  could start searching for these objects. Because what kind of a market is there for stolen
20:01.040 - 20:04.840:  artifacts like this? I would have thought that once the word is out and you've got this inventory
20:04.840 - 20:09.540:  that you say be very difficult to move on or are there private collectors who have got no
20:09.540 - 20:14.440:  scruples about this? Well, we're talking about the art world and that's where something where
20:14.440 - 20:21.700:  scruples is hard to come by. We have very reputable auction houses that will do due diligence,
20:21.700 - 20:26.780:  that will hold objects that they know are stolen. But then you have a lot of smaller auction houses
20:26.780 - 20:31.960:  that are more interested in earning commissions and get frustrated when someone reports something
20:31.960 - 20:36.880:  as stolen in their sale room and they just hand it back to the person who brought it in.
20:37.460 - 20:45.480:  Then you have disreputable dealers who will handle anything to make a profit. There was also the
20:46.700 - 20:55.200:  black market which will sell anything at a severe discount to collectors and dealers who
20:55.560 - 21:00.380:  do no due diligence and really don't care. That was Christopher Maranello then.
21:01.340 - 21:05.660:  Let's head to Zimbabwe now where people will soon take part in a presidential election.
21:05.660 - 21:11.000:  It will be the second since Robert Mugabi was ousted by the military six years ago.
21:11.460 - 21:15.180:  And when he left, hopes were high that his successor, Emerson Menungagua,
21:15.640 - 21:20.500:  might rebuild the failing economy and commit to democratic principles. And those hopes
21:20.500 - 21:25.660:  after President Mugabi was ejected have all but vanished and skilled workers are leaving in
21:25.660 - 21:32.020:  their thousands. Shard Ashton reports now from the capital Harari. Everyone she spoke to asked
21:32.020 - 21:38.240:  us not to use their real names. That's the street where money changes are from this corner.
21:38.480 - 21:43.560:  Oh these guys, they're exchanging foreign currency. They're buying and selling.
21:44.140 - 21:50.580:  Yeah. Taxi driver Dixon is taking us on a tour of downtown Harari. The streets are lined with
21:50.580 - 21:56.980:  money changes swapping Zimbabwe dollars for US dollars. Because the US dollars will retain
21:56.980 - 22:03.160:  their value and the Zimbabwe dollar is not. It's not. And there's no ways you can keep Zimbabwe
22:03.160 - 22:09.280:  dollar now at home. You know, in banks or even at home. Because it's losing value in
22:09.280 - 22:14.320:  any area every day. The local currency has rapidly devalued in the last five years,
22:14.320 - 22:20.080:  driving a black market for US dollars. Street vendors selling other things are everywhere too.
22:20.620 - 22:25.020:  And on third avenue there are sex workers. Look at the girls from the right side.
22:26.220 - 22:31.000:  Young girl. Young girl. Short dresser. Big eyelashes. Fake eyelashes and
22:31.920 - 22:37.320:  dyed hair. Or the way down there. And there's a number of sex workers on this street
22:37.320 - 22:42.220:  increased in recent times. It has increased to before this street.
22:43.720 - 22:50.400:  Was this not good at all? The last 12 months have seen outbreaks of typhoid and cholera as water
22:50.400 - 22:56.540:  and sewage systems deteriorate. About a third of Zimbabweans are food insecure and a quarter of
22:56.540 - 23:02.760:  children under five are chronically malnourished. All this is driving an exodus of skilled workers.
23:03.360 - 23:08.740:  The UK is one of the top destinations. In 2020 the British government issued a thousand
23:08.740 - 23:14.660:  skilled worker visas to Zimbabweans last year that had risen to more than 23,000.
23:15.420 - 23:21.540:  The main decision I made to come to the UK was based on finding stable and solid ground
23:21.540 - 23:27.320:  to be able to have a guaranteed salary every month. Despite the typhoid that I'm doing,
23:27.320 - 23:32.900:  that is worlds apart from what I went to school to study. Rose has a master's degree,
23:32.900 - 23:38.380:  but moved to the UK last year for a care worker job in the Midlands. She lives in shared
23:38.380 - 23:43.900:  accommodation, but the biggest sacrifice she's made is leaving behind her nine-year-old daughter.
23:44.400 - 23:49.340:  Rose's hope is to bring her daughter to the UK for secondary school, because Zimbabwe's
23:49.340 - 23:55.660:  education system, once famed as the best in Africa, is collapsing. Gosh, this is very neat
23:55.660 - 24:01.160:  handwriting. What are you, what are you doing this evening? I was writing notes on history
24:01.200 - 24:06.940:  because we have exams that are coming up. So you're teaching yourself, basically?
24:06.940 - 24:11.980:  Yes. Earlier this year the British government puts Zimbabwe on a list of countries whose
24:11.980 - 24:17.980:  teachers can apply for qualified teacher status, allowing them to work long term in the UK.
24:18.720 - 24:23.540:  So the exodus of care workers could become an exodus of the country's educators.
24:24.200 - 24:29.260:  That was Charlotte Ashton, and you can hear more from Charlotte about the current situation
24:29.260 - 24:33.600:  in Zimbabwe on this week's edition of assignment here on the BBC World Service,
24:34.260 - 24:37.300:  or search for the documentary wherever you get your podcasts.
24:39.180 - 24:44.900:  Teachers in most countries used to be able to physically restrain or even beat the kids in their
24:44.900 - 24:51.140:  classrooms. That's been outlawed in most places now, but one nation South Korea is at least partially
24:51.140 - 24:57.000:  going back to the past. Jay Sung Lee from the BBC's Newsroom went to school in South Korea,
24:57.000 - 25:01.500:  and he told me more about the new rules. So South Korea's education ministry approved
25:01.500 - 25:06.800:  these new powers which come into force next month for teachers to discipline their students after
25:06.800 - 25:11.400:  protests by teachers over abuse by pupils and parents. Now, under these new laws,
25:11.400 - 25:15.900:  teachers will be allowed to remove students from classrooms and confiscate their mobile phones
25:15.900 - 25:21.540:  if they cause any disruption in class. Currently, as we've talked about, any form of physical
25:21.540 - 25:26.340:  punishment for students is banned. This was after authorities introduced the ordinance of
25:26.340 - 25:31.180:  student right law in 2010, which prohibits these kind of physical punishment in classrooms.
25:31.880 - 25:37.040:  But now, authorities think that this law has taken too much power from teachers in classroom,
25:37.040 - 25:43.260:  and the announcement today follows the death of a 24-year-old elementary school teacher last month,
25:43.260 - 25:48.940:  who killed herself after allegedly being harassed by parents over a school violence case,
25:48.940 - 25:52.800:  and her premature death has sparked a national outcry in South Korea.
25:53.140 - 25:57.600:  I mean, that's clearly appalling. I understand, until quite recently, in fact, when you were at school,
25:58.380 - 26:01.240:  teachers were allowed to use co-proponishment, weren't they?
26:01.360 - 26:05.440:  Oh, definitely. The mentality was like the spirit of road spoiled the child,
26:05.440 - 26:10.140:  and parents thought it was actually okay for teachers to discipline their children at school
26:10.140 - 26:15.480:  if they misbehaved. This was quite normal. I remember back when I was an elementary school student
26:15.480 - 26:21.120:  in the early 2000s, we misbehaved and we unfortunately broke a window in the classroom,
26:21.540 - 26:26.240:  and the teacher got really, really angry, and she lined us up all up in front of the class
26:26.660 - 26:32.840:  and hit our palms with a plastic ruler one by one, and I remember so my classmates crying,
26:32.840 - 26:36.880:  and it's not a nice thing, but that was kind of normal back then.
26:36.960 - 26:40.240:  And these new laws aren't going to go back to that kind of thing,
26:40.240 - 26:44.360:  but are there some people in South Korea who still feel that that would be a good thing to do?
26:45.200 - 26:49.300:  So definitely, these news rules means that teachers will be able to physically restrain
26:49.300 - 26:54.280:  those students who misbehaved, but I think there is still some sort of mentality in South Korea
26:54.280 - 26:57.200:  that feels like if children misbehaved, they need to be punished.
26:57.200 - 27:03.900:  That was Jay Sung Lee. People visiting the Forest of Goa in Southwest India have been treated
27:03.900 - 27:09.740:  to a rare scientific spectacle, an unearthly glow coming from the forest floor itself.
27:10.460 - 27:13.660:  Haven't been drenched with rain mushrooms a glowing in the dark,
27:13.660 - 27:19.300:  committing a bioluminescence which has inspired wonder in people who have been witnessing it for
27:19.300 - 27:25.720:  thousands of years. Even Aristotle, it seems, once witnessed it and mused on why it might be happening.
27:26.440 - 27:31.500:  Professor Jay Dunlap is from the Geysel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in the US
27:31.500 - 27:37.020:  whose research focuses on bioluminescent fungi. He described it to Simon Jack.
27:37.720 - 27:43.480:  It looks like a mushroom except it is making its own light. The light is very dim,
27:43.880 - 27:47.720:  so if you were trying to look at it in the daytime, you wouldn't be able to see anything,
27:47.740 - 27:56.420:  but at night when there's no interference from outside lighting, it's a constant green light
27:57.120 - 28:02.320:  coming from the inside of the mushroom, so you can still see the the the gills underneath.
28:02.320 - 28:06.440:  It's all glowing. An on mass, it must create quite a magical effect.
28:07.420 - 28:13.060:  It's quite magical. An individual mushroom is beautiful and a bunch of these growing together,
28:13.060 - 28:17.820:  or if they would move off into the distance with lots of them, it would be quite magical.
28:18.840 - 28:22.340:  And what's going on here? What's creating this unearthly light?
28:22.520 - 28:28.020:  It's an enzymatic reaction. There's an enzyme called a luciferase. That's a generic term.
28:28.520 - 28:36.180:  I should back up and say bioluminescence is very widespread in nature. So fungi do it, insects do it,
28:36.180 - 28:43.560:  fish do it, bacteria do it, lots of organisms do it, and they all use an enzyme called a luciferase.
28:43.560 - 28:49.740:  Although the luciferases are different in different organisms. So this enzyme works on a substrate
28:49.740 - 28:56.000:  called a luciferin, and along with molecular oxygen, the luciferase oxidizes the luciferin that
28:56.000 - 29:04.700:  makes a high energy intermediate, and the enzyme holds this oxidized substrate and causes the energy
29:04.700 - 29:10.420:  to be emitted as light instead of heat. That's what's going on in the cells of all these fungi.
29:11.000 - 29:18.960:  I'm no linguist, but luciferase, luciferin, sounds like it has origins in lucifer, is this?
29:18.960 - 29:22.160:  That's your very perceptive, and that is exactly correct.
29:22.320 - 29:28.560:  Do we know why what sort of function this performs in nature? Do we know what the function of this?
29:28.780 - 29:35.400:  But different organisms use bioluminescence for different things. They can use it for communication
29:35.620 - 29:42.900:  or for attracting mates, or as an aposomatic warning that I am poisonous, don't eat me,
29:42.900 - 29:49.660:  or I don't taste good, don't eat me. One of the uses is probably in helping fungi get from
29:49.660 - 29:55.400:  place to place. The green light is attractive to insects that like to come and eat them, and when
29:55.400 - 30:00.560:  they come they will, the insects will be covered with spores, and then they'll carry these spores
30:00.560 - 30:07.540:  off into the rest of the forest, and so it's beneficial to the fungi to help them get around.
30:07.540 - 30:12.900:  But is this rare? I mean, a sighting like this, a phenomenon like this that we're seeing in
30:12.900 - 30:20.080:  Goa, in southwest India. Is this a kind of once-in-a-lifetime thing for a botanist or someone
30:20.080 - 30:25.720:  lucky enough to come across it? Far from once-in-a-lifetime, once the mushroom is there, it will continue to
30:25.720 - 30:31.300:  turn up when the conditions are right, and if the mushroom is not there then they will never be
30:31.300 - 30:40.760:  there. So I would guess this will be a not-in-frequent occurrence, maybe not annual, but certainly far
30:40.760 - 30:47.660:  from rare in the regions where they are seen. Yeah, I've seen it myself in the sea at the Atlantic
30:47.660 - 30:52.440:  occasionally. Is it the same sort of process that's happening? It's the same, it's very similar
30:52.440 - 30:58.660:  chemistry. Again, there's the Luciferin and the Luciferase, the energetics are very similar.
30:58.940 - 31:02.780:  You're talking about the flashing light you would see in an ocean wave when it breaks.
31:02.960 - 31:06.620:  Yes, but just one of those things in nature that gives us a sense of real wonder.
31:06.900 - 31:10.760:  Yes, this is the beauty of biology. Professor Jay Dunlap.
31:12.720 - 31:16.180:  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
31:16.180 - 31:21.000:  later on. If you want a comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an
