00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service, with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:18.380:  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Janut
00:18.380 - 00:25.200:  Jolion, 13 hours GMT on Tuesday, 1 August. These are our main stories. Drone attacks in Moscow
00:25.200 - 00:30.600:  and the Black Sea. A skyscraper in the Russian capital is hit for the second time in days.
00:31.520 - 00:35.700:  Myanmar's military rulers give a partial pardon to the deposed civilian leader,
00:35.700 - 00:39.580:  Ungsan Suu Chi. We assess what lies behind the surprise move.
00:41.720 - 00:43.280:  Also in this podcast...
00:43.560 - 00:48.160:  Hi, Barbie. Hi, Barbie. Hi, Barbie. Hi, Barbie. Hi, Barbie. They won't fear it.
00:50.580 - 00:57.200:  Until they understand it. Why some Japanese cinema goers are saying no barbenheimer.
01:02.000 - 01:08.780:  18 months after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia is itself being attacked on several fronts.
01:08.840 - 01:15.500:  It's seen frequent cross-border strikes. A key bridge linking occupied Crimea to Russia was
01:15.500 - 01:21.700:  hit last month, and now the Russian capital itself has been attacked again. Overnight,
01:21.700 - 01:26.200:  a skyscraper in Moscow housing several government ministries were struck by a drone.
01:26.200 - 01:32.060:  The second time it's been hit in just a few days. Akadi Metler lives in the building, which is partly
01:32.060 - 01:39.140:  residential. Everything was normal and then we heard a loud bang. The
01:39.140 - 01:44.420:  wasn't much panic just everyone went outside. There is no fear. What's there to be afraid of?
01:45.200 - 01:49.940:  The emergency services came straight away. All we can do now is stick together and everything
01:49.940 - 01:55.000:  will be fine. Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry said it had
01:55.000 - 01:59.300:  afforded attacks by Ukrainian seed loans on two of its ships in the Black Sea.
01:59.300 - 02:05.120:  A Ukrainian presidential adviser calls the claims fictitious, saying Kiev would not attack
02:05.120 - 02:10.080:  any civilian vessels. Our Russia editor for BBC Monitoring, Vitaly Shivchenko,
02:10.080 - 02:16.980:  told us more about these latest attacks. The Russian capital's business quarter, the so-called
02:17.020 - 02:25.220:  Moscow city, has come under an apparent drone attack, and this is the second such attack in three
02:25.220 - 02:36.860:  days. Even though damage is minimal and in military terms, it's not going to make Russia change
02:36.860 - 02:45.440:  its strategy in pursuing this war on Ukraine. There are very good reasons for Ukraine to
02:45.440 - 02:52.180:  carry out such attacks. Now, I have to say that Ukraine has consistently denied,
02:52.300 - 03:00.420:  or was tight-lipped on its involvement in such attacks before, so we can't definitely say
03:00.420 - 03:06.880:  it was Ukraine, but if it was Ukraine, the reasons for carrying out such attacks would be first
03:06.980 - 03:15.700:  to demonstrate its ability to strike right at the heart of the Russian capital. Secondly,
03:15.740 - 03:22.500:  to cause instability, so chaos and confusion, and this is a very important reason,
03:22.500 - 03:31.760:  such attacks, they undermine a key stated objective presented by Vladimir Putin last year when he
03:31.760 - 03:37.460:  was launching his so-called special military operation in Ukraine. He said he wanted to make Russia
03:37.460 - 03:44.740:  safer. Has it happened? Well, it's not obviously, and to many residents of the Russian capital,
03:44.740 - 03:50.560:  it is obvious that they have become less secure because of this special military operation.
03:51.120 - 03:55.160:  Yes, so this is very difficult for the Russian authorities to explain, but at the same time,
03:55.160 - 04:00.800:  they're saying that they have thwarted attacks elsewhere in the Black Sea by Ukrainian
04:00.800 - 04:07.980:  seedrains. Yes, earlier today, the Russian defense ministry issued a statement saying that
04:08.880 - 04:18.500:  to Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels, i.e. naval drones, try to attack Russian Navy ships,
04:19.380 - 04:25.840:  south-west of Crimea, and you will remember that this is the area which has everything to do with
04:25.840 - 04:33.160:  the grain deal, the collapsed grain deal, after Russia pulled out of it, and there's a lot of
04:33.160 - 04:40.900:  tension in the area, and whether or not the details given by Russia are true, the fact remains
04:40.900 - 04:50.880:  that the focus very much is on that area, and Ukraine is trying to unblock the attempted Russian
04:50.880 - 04:58.440:  blocade, and make any future shipments of Ukraine more secure.
04:59.360 - 05:04.380:  Vitaly Shevchenko, Myanmar's military rulers have given a partial pardon to the
05:04.380 - 05:10.060:  ousted civilian leader, Ung San Suu Chi. The 78-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner had been sentenced
05:10.060 - 05:17.560:  to decades in jail on a range of charges following a military coup in February 2021. Since then,
05:17.560 - 05:22.360:  the country has faced chaos and widespread violence as the military has tried to crack down
05:22.360 - 05:27.520:  on a resistance movement. I asked our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head whether this
05:27.520 - 05:33.520:  partial pardon had come as a surprise. It is a bit of a surprise. I mean, Ung San Suu Chi has always
05:33.520 - 05:38.020:  been excluded from previous amnesty, and there have been quite a number of them. On auspicious
05:38.020 - 05:41.560:  states, the military likes to release often just criminals, but even political prisoners
05:42.060 - 05:45.760:  are either pardoned or have their sentences cut. This is a sort of way of showing leniency,
05:45.760 - 05:51.640:  the aftermath that against the 24,000 people who've been detained for opposing the military since
05:51.640 - 05:57.220:  their coup, and nearly 20,000 of those remain inside. So, you know, mercy is limited. Giving leniency
05:57.220 - 06:02.160:  like this to Ung San Suu Chi sends a very different signal. She's been totally isolated since she was
06:02.160 - 06:06.560:  arrested after the coup. She's hardly been seen. Almost no one's been allowed to speak to her.
06:07.020 - 06:11.340:  It's almost as though the military wanted her to vanish. But if they are giving her leniency now,
06:11.340 - 06:16.000:  making it public, they're also moving her or have moved her. I should say from prison,
06:16.000 - 06:20.140:  where they put her last year, after the last of her convictions, back to house arrest,
06:20.140 - 06:25.600:  softer conditions. That coincides with quite a bit of diplomacy. Some of it controversial,
06:25.600 - 06:30.760:  some of it criticized, but there are attempts by countries in this region to talk to the military
06:30.760 - 06:35.920:  and see if they can find an end to this terrible civil war. And if the military is publicly showing
06:35.920 - 06:41.740:  leniency to Ung San Suu Chi, it's likely that they're considering her as part of some kind of
06:41.740 - 06:46.660:  compromise. If they are to cut any kind of deal with a now very bitter and angry opposition
06:46.660 - 06:51.480:  after all the death and destruction, they will need Ung San Suu Chi to help deliver that deal.
06:51.480 - 06:55.780:  But of course, what we don't know is what she thinks. And she can be pretty stubborn and tough
06:56.120 - 06:59.940:  when it comes to dealing with the military. She has been in the past. So, are we likely to see
06:59.940 - 07:05.700:  her released or will she remain in detention? My assumption is the 33 years of prison they gave
07:05.700 - 07:09.620:  her with just a number. It didn't really matter. The cases were pretty ludicrous anyway.
07:09.620 - 07:15.560:  She's always been a political pawn. The military will always calculate their fear of her
07:15.560 - 07:19.900:  electoral popularity because they have promised, they will have to hold an election at some point
07:19.900 - 07:25.780:  against the fact that she's internationally so renowned that giving leniency to her is an
07:25.780 - 07:30.300:  essential way in which they can show directly outside world they're willing to compromise.
07:30.300 - 07:35.820:  We all think at some point she will be part of a grand deal to end the conflict. The problem
07:35.820 - 07:40.440:  for the military, though, is that she may not play ball. But even if she does, the opposition
07:40.440 - 07:45.480:  movement now has sort of left her behind. It's driven by a lot of young people. There's been a
07:45.480 - 07:50.480:  terrible loss of life, an enormous destruction opposing the military. And most of these opposition
07:50.620 - 07:55.440:  people, Minism taking up arms, believe that the goal must be to defeat the military altogether,
07:55.440 - 07:58.060:  not just to do a deal with them and that could be where a problem lies.
07:59.240 - 08:01.980:  Jonathan Head, two northern China now.
08:04.660 - 08:08.760:  Where military helicopters have been involved in aid and rescue efforts for flood victims,
08:08.760 - 08:14.820:  the number of dead has risen to 20 after days of torrential rain in the wake of typhoon
08:14.820 - 08:20.520:  Dock 3. Tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes and searches are continuing for
08:20.520 - 08:26.500:  the missing. President Xi Jinping has called for every effort to be made to rescue those lost or
08:26.500 - 08:31.980:  trapped. Our China correspondent Stephen McDonald is in Beijing and started by telling us there had
08:31.980 - 08:39.520:  been some good news. The rain here has stopped and it may be that it's going to ease off now for
08:39.520 - 08:46.120:  a few days. Also, the second typhoon due to hit in the next 24 hours in Georgian province
08:46.860 - 08:51.440:  may not in fact strike there and there seems to be indication that the weather pattern from there
08:51.760 - 08:57.920:  may not reach Beijing. That would be good news for the rescue teams trying to deal with this very
08:57.920 - 09:03.220:  difficult situation. I mean the other good news for their purposes is that they've managed to find
09:03.220 - 09:09.120:  14 of the 27 missing people. So of course the hopes are that there are others out there to be found
09:09.120 - 09:15.060:  and that the death toll won't go up. However in the western suburbs of Beijing there are
09:15.500 - 09:21.340:  communities still cut off without electricity, without water, where roads have collapsed and where
09:21.340 - 09:27.440:  the army has been flying in with helicopters to drop off emergency supplies. In neighbouring
09:27.440 - 09:33.160:  Herbe province there's a small city big town called Georgia. Now that place looks to have been
09:33.160 - 09:40.080:  pretty hard by the flooding and where yet to see the devastation there what seems to have happened
09:40.080 - 09:45.720:  is that in an attempt to take the pressure off Beijing to divert the flooding waters elsewhere
09:46.600 - 09:53.960:  the water has been driven down in that direction and as a result has flooded that town as I say
09:53.960 - 09:59.500:  which does look like the streets in the heart of the place up to the first floor of buildings
10:00.620 - 10:06.980:  engulfed by water so tough for them but again like now the army is having to be sent in to drop
10:06.980 - 10:12.100:  medical supplies to try to rescue people and either way in the coming days there's going to be a
10:12.100 - 10:17.560:  very big cleanup here. And briefly Stephen Beijing is simply not used to flooding like this.
10:18.440 - 10:22.720:  Yeah in the south of China they get typhoons like this all the time they're sort of geared up
10:22.720 - 10:28.820:  for it the rescue teams are used to it every year. Beijing has had sort of storms and
10:28.820 - 10:34.960:  flooding like this but rarely and so when it comes it can be deadly and this is what happened when
10:34.960 - 10:41.700:  you know windows flash floods came along washing dozens of cars into gushing brown you know rivers
10:42.280 - 10:47.740:  and it has been very deadly for a population not used to it. Stephen McDonald in Beijing
10:47.820 - 10:52.700:  it was one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the Mediterranean in recent years
10:53.180 - 10:57.100:  an overcrowded ship carrying hundreds of people trying to reach Europe
10:57.100 - 11:03.280:  sank off the coast of Greece in June many of those who died were from Pakistan people so
11:03.280 - 11:09.120:  desperate to escape poverty in their homeland they were willing to risk their lives and despite
11:09.120 - 11:14.480:  this tragedy thousands of Pakistanis are still taking the same route to Europe as those who
11:14.480 - 11:20.200:  perished traveling via Libya in North Africa. Our Pakistan correspondent Caroline Davies was given
11:20.200 - 11:25.240:  rare access to one of the suspects allegedly involved in the capsizing.
11:26.900 - 11:33.040:  16 men are being held in this police station part of Pakistan's crackdown on illegal migration.
11:33.100 - 11:38.520:  The majority here are alleged to have been involved in filling the migrant boat that left Libya
11:38.520 - 11:45.260:  and sank off the coast of Greece including Husnan Shah. He admits to being a human smuggler
11:45.600 - 11:49.320:  for more than 10 years but denies that he was involved in this incident.
11:52.120 - 11:56.720:  We started this because there was no other business because of greed and the difficult situation
11:56.720 - 12:02.260:  everyone is ready to take this journey. The government is not doing anything for the young
12:02.260 - 12:07.800:  generation here. I do not have a main role it's the people who are sitting in Libya who are very
12:07.800 - 12:11.880:  big and rich. Do you feel guilty for the sort of things that have happened to people on these
12:11.880 - 12:19.560:  weeks? I felt very sorry and we are really ashamed over this but what can we do if I don't do
12:19.560 - 12:25.720:  this someone else will do it. Hundreds of Pakistanis are thought to have drowned when the packed
12:25.720 - 12:32.400:  boat sank in June including Farid and Najmah's teenage sons. The family may never have a body
12:32.400 - 12:40.000:  to bury. Instead they have voice messages. Najmah plays them to me.
12:41.820 - 12:49.880:  The message their father early morning from somebody's mobile saying we are leaving.
12:51.180 - 12:59.240:  Tell mother this is our last message. Now she tells me she listens to them then cries for hours.
13:02.540 - 13:07.440:  The BBC has been told that the route from Pakistan via Egypt and Libya is increasingly popular.
13:07.900 - 13:13.360:  Officials have told us that nearly 13,000 Pakistanis travel to the two countries in the first
13:13.400 - 13:19.860:  six months of this year. Compare that to the whole of 2022 where only 7,000 took the route.
13:20.560 - 13:25.120:  And of those 13,000 around 10,000 have not returned.
13:25.660 - 13:30.780:  Muhammad al-Amshinwari is in charge of Pakistan's investigation into what happened into the
13:30.780 - 13:36.060:  Greek shipwreck. They have gone to Libya and we don't know whether they are still in Libya or
13:36.060 - 13:41.480:  if they have gone to any of the European countries. The situation is made more complicated
13:41.480 - 13:46.360:  than the police say because the flights out of the country are legal. They have legal visa,
13:46.360 - 13:55.500:  they have legal passport so we wouldn't stop them. Farid let his teenage sons go with the same
13:55.500 - 14:04.420:  smuggler that have taken him to Germany illegally eight years before. I thought we are poor people
14:05.120 - 14:10.500:  even if they get educated they won't find a job so I thought they will go there get educated
14:10.500 - 14:15.840:  and work. It doesn't matter how much anyone convinces you you shouldn't go.
14:16.760 - 14:22.240:  This village may remember those that died in Greece's waters but many we spoke to hold little
14:22.240 - 14:27.120:  faith in what Pakistan can offer and the port to go can outweigh the fear.
14:28.340 - 14:33.820:  That report by Caroline Davies. Parts of India's northern state of Haryana remain
14:33.820 - 14:39.360:  tense after three people including a Muslim cleric and two policemen were killed in violence
14:39.360 - 14:46.000:  triggered by religious tensions during a procession by Hindu nationalist groups. Arunade Mukherjee
14:46.000 - 14:52.320:  has more details. Schools are shut and internet suspended in new after the violence which began in
14:52.320 - 14:57.960:  the city spread to other parts bordering India's capital city of Delhi. At the centre of the violence
14:57.960 - 15:04.060:  is Monu Manisar, a member of the right wing Hindu outfit Bajrangal who is wanted by the police
15:04.460 - 15:10.220:  in connection with the murder of two Muslim cattle traders in February and has been absconding since.
15:10.980 - 15:16.280:  He posted a video openly saying he would participate in the Hindu march which angered local
15:16.280 - 15:21.420:  Muslims who have been demanding his arrest. Violence broke out on Monday afternoon during the
15:21.420 - 15:27.220:  Hindu procession and footage from new showed stone pelting by a mob as cars were set on fire
15:27.220 - 15:33.320:  and shops vandalized. A mosque was burnt down in the city of Gurugram on the outskirts of Delhi.
15:33.800 - 15:38.440:  Authorities have imposed a curfew in new and the state government has appealed for peace.
15:38.940 - 15:43.880:  Additional forces have been sent by the federal government to help maintain law in order.
15:44.800 - 15:45.920:  Arunade Mukherjee
15:48.480 - 15:53.860:  Still to come on this podcast, the US avoids a shock exit from the women's world cup football but
15:53.860 - 15:59.320:  only just. A little scary, honestly. I think we could have played a lot better. It was a little messy
15:59.900 - 16:01.600:  and Portugal gave us run for our money.
16:09.160 - 16:15.320:  Hi, I'm Hannah. I am the host of a new daily podcast What in the World from the BBC World Service
16:15.760 - 16:20.520:  where we try to help you make sense of the world around you explaining the big events
16:20.520 - 16:25.600:  and some of the smaller events so that you might feel a little bit better when you pick up your phone

16:32.020 - 16:40.080:  podcasts and hit subscribe. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now to a heartwarming story
16:40.080 - 16:45.540:  in southern India. A group of sanitation workers in Kerala have just won the lottery.
16:45.540 - 16:52.020:  The women who are basically refuse collectors usually earn about 250 rupees a day which is about
16:52.020 - 17:00.200:  $3. Now they've hit the jackpot and won the equivalent of $1.2 million. So how is this going
17:00.200 - 17:05.580:  to transform their lives? My colleague Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to the BBC's reporter
17:05.580 - 17:12.100:  in the state, Ashraf Padana. They have a group of 11 women. They are garbage collected basically.
17:12.420 - 17:17.220:  They are collecting biodegradable garbage and separate them and deposit them in a local
17:17.220 - 17:23.080:  collection center where the local authorities sell them to factories for recycling or reuse and
17:23.080 - 17:29.540:  they will get a part of the proceeds. So they're quite poor really these women aren't they? And
17:29.540 - 17:35.860:  I understand they're older women too. I think the youngest one was 49. Yeah, that's right.
17:36.240 - 17:41.640:  The oldest is 72. They work as a group and they go to homes and households and
17:41.640 - 17:46.500:  local institutions and schools and like that and collect garbage every day and the beneficiaries
17:46.500 - 17:52.940:  will repair them 50 rupees per unit and they will divide them equally. So they're quite a tight
17:52.940 - 17:58.580:  friendship group then aren't they? I mean I understand that they're so poor some of them had to
17:58.580 - 18:03.780:  borrow the money from each other to be able to buy this one ticket they bought together.
18:04.540 - 18:11.720:  Yeah, one of them that eldest ones, Kutty Marlow, she is 70 years old and she was not having
18:11.720 - 18:18.000:  25 rupees to spare. They decided to buy this ticket which is which cost 250 rupees
18:18.640 - 18:25.980:  and they decided to divide themselves. So while others get 6.3 million rupees,
18:26.480 - 18:32.220:  they will get half of them. So they're going to share it out equally that's a good story.
18:32.540 - 18:37.440:  What about their jobs? Are they going to keep working or does this mean they can all retire?
18:38.300 - 18:43.060:  They're not skilled people. They are semi-educated, semi-literate people. So they don't have
18:43.060 - 18:49.120:  regular work. So they take up these kind of jobs or jobs and this is a local collective
18:49.120 - 18:56.700:  called Green Army who collects garbage from households and institutions and send them 40 seconds.
18:57.260 - 18:59.300:  How do you think this is going to affect their lives?
19:00.460 - 19:06.660:  It will have a huge impact on their life. Many of them don't have their own homes and
19:07.340 - 19:13.960:  they need to marry off their daughters. Some need to find money to get medical treatment and
19:13.960 - 19:19.880:  work. Yes, I think one of the women actually lost her home in one of the recent floods.
19:20.700 - 19:24.240:  So this will be very welcome. Maybe she can build another one now.
19:24.700 - 19:30.500:  Yeah, that's right. She lost her home was washed away in the 28th and devastating
19:31.160 - 19:35.040:  deluge in Kerala. The family doesn't have a home now.
19:35.860 - 19:40.900:  Playing the lottery is banned in some Indian states, isn't it? Not Kerala though.
19:41.140 - 19:45.080:  How does it work and what I think it's run by the government, isn't it?
19:45.900 - 19:51.020:  Kerala is communist to read out, you know, and there are no major industries in Kerala.
19:51.600 - 19:57.480:  So this state is heavily dependent on lottery sales and hardcore. So in just total
19:58.480 - 20:05.420:  90 percent of industrial revenue sales comes from Kerala and it contributes 15 more than
20:05.420 - 20:10.260:  15 percent of the state's revenue collections. And every day there is a lottery.
20:10.660 - 20:13.400:  And the state government is, it's the state government monopoly.
20:13.400 - 20:18.460:  Private players are not allowed in Kerala and other states cannot sell their lottery in Kerala.
20:18.660 - 20:21.020:  So this is a major revenue source for the state.
20:21.620 - 20:27.360:  So it's a good way for the state government to get money then to try to provide services and
20:27.360 - 20:32.040:  things. What have these women told you because I know you've been speaking to them?
20:32.180 - 20:33.660:  Are they going to keep playing the lottery?
20:34.940 - 20:40.700:  Yeah, they will keep working with the green army because it was their collective that brought
20:40.700 - 20:47.560:  them the left and they will keep working with the group. Most of them have launched a playoff
20:47.800 - 20:52.080:  and houses to build, get their children and grand children to get it and like that.
20:53.200 - 20:58.660:  Ashraf Padana, film vans around the world have been enjoying the simultaneous release of two
20:58.700 - 21:03.080:  completely different movies, Barbie and Oppenheimer.
21:23.300 - 21:29.420:  Some memes have combined the pink plastic Barbie world with images of atomic bomb explosions
21:30.020 - 21:34.520:  and that has upset and angered people in one of the world's biggest cinema markets,
21:34.940 - 21:41.400:  Japan. This month it will be marking the 78th anniversary of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima
21:41.400 - 21:48.220:  and Nagasaki with solemn ceremonies. Our reporter, Mariko Oy, told us more about the controversy.
21:49.240 - 21:54.300:  The two movies came out over the same weekend in the United States and other parts of the world,
21:54.460 - 22:00.660:  prompting, I guess, you know, Barb and Hymer phenomenon or meme and a lot of social media users
22:01.460 - 22:07.560:  you know took to what is it called now? X, formerly known as Twitter with some images and you know
22:07.560 - 22:13.340:  a lot of fan jokes and stuff but then some of them were rather distasteful in the eyes of
22:13.340 - 22:19.620:  especially the Japanese public. So for example in one of them the actress who played Barbie,
22:20.180 - 22:28.200:  her hair was in a mushroom cloud hairstyle and what got people angry wasn't the actual meme itself
22:28.200 - 22:34.360:  but the fact that the official Twitter or X account of this Barbie movie started responding to
22:34.360 - 22:42.240:  some of them in a pretty positive manner because this person who posted this picture said you know
22:42.240 - 22:47.340:  it was my father's idea so the Barbie movie's official Twitter account said you know he's
22:47.660 - 22:53.300:  you know this can is such a stylist and other comments you know just talking about how this is
22:53.300 - 22:58.740:  the summer to remember with you know kisses and heart and say well when the actual poster that
22:58.740 - 23:05.400:  they created really was seen to be making fun of atomic bombs and of course hundreds of thousands
23:05.400 - 23:10.760:  of people died in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan at the end of the Second World War
23:11.340 - 23:17.100:  and as a result as you can imagine a lot of people have been angry and yesterday Warner Brothers
23:17.100 - 23:23.340:  Japan which distributes to the Barbie movie in Japan when it opens in about 10 days they had to
23:23.340 - 23:29.620:  issue an apology they also said that they have requested the US headquarters to respond and I've
23:29.620 - 23:34.440:  just been emailing them back and forth trying to get a statement but it appears that those
23:34.700 - 23:38.840:  what's been described as distasteful responses have now been deleted.
23:40.700 - 23:46.080:  And what are people on Japanese social media saying because the the two movies that you
23:46.080 - 23:52.020:  come out in Japan and people there must feel that the history of their country has been kind of
23:52.020 - 23:57.480:  ignored with all these memes coming out making jokes about the atomic bomb.
23:58.640 - 24:03.660:  Yeah to be fair openheimer still hasn't got a release date because as you can imagine it is a
24:04.000 - 24:10.300:  a lot more sensitive topic for the Japanese distributor to decide on a date. Now whether or not this
24:11.200 - 24:15.460:  you know this all these memes and people getting angry about it whether or not that would have an
24:15.460 - 24:20.480:  impact on its release date that remains to be seen but as you said you know some of the comments
24:20.480 - 24:26.960:  were very emotional you know one person said you know my father was in Hiroshima just a few days
24:26.960 - 24:32.680:  before the atomic bomb was dropped and you know he talked about how so many of his friends died and
24:32.980 - 24:39.640:  you know a lot of people who died because of the atomic bomb were children who were the age group
24:39.640 - 24:45.240:  who were playing with Barbie dolls and you know for them not to even have the imagination to think
24:45.240 - 24:50.580:  of that or when they reply to those memes you know some people are very very angry and upset.
24:51.520 - 24:57.680:  Mariko Oy. When she is an in court presiding over bankruptcy cases US judge
24:57.680 - 25:03.920:  Stacey Jernigan is writing legal thrillers but this is led to her being accused of bias by one of
25:03.920 - 25:09.500:  the defendants in her court James Donaro who's facing charges of fraud. He claims that Texan
25:09.500 - 25:16.640:  judges novels are jeopardizing her impartiality Camilla Mills told us more about this intriguing tale
25:16.640 - 25:23.060:  of fact versus fiction. So James Donaro he has been accused essentially of fraud of siphoning
25:23.060 - 25:28.940:  funds from a capital management company so the judge presiding over this case she is a judge
25:28.940 - 25:34.860:  who works in bankruptcy but she is also a self-published novelist she's written two books
25:34.860 - 25:41.540:  that center around hedge fund managers in her books she describes quote bro culture and outrageous
25:41.540 - 25:48.020:  amounts of hubris and in her latest book she talks about a hedonistic narcissistic playboy
25:48.120 - 25:54.880:  now mr. Donaro has claimed that he immediately recognized this character to be him so he has
25:54.880 - 26:00.620:  asked that she be removed from his case because it's showing bias and what has a judge said in
26:00.620 - 26:06.080:  response this well she has denied this she has dismissed it he has filed a number of motions to
26:06.080 - 26:11.380:  have her removed which have haven't been successful they've been on the same case for over two years
26:11.380 - 26:17.340:  now she's said that Agatha Christie and his Hemingway that they all used real life events
26:17.340 - 26:24.180:  as inspiration but she claims that the character is not based on mr. Donaro Camilla Mills
26:24.860 - 26:30.340:  now to a brand new event which is kicked off in Nairobi taking place at the millen memorial library
26:30.340 - 26:35.300:  throughout the week the african book fair will showcase more than 10,000 works representing
26:35.300 - 26:41.740:  all 54 african countries including anglophone francophone and lucophone writing and it's been
26:41.740 - 26:47.340:  described as Kenny's largest selection of continental literature ahead of the festival my colleague
26:47.340 - 26:53.520:  Beverly Occiang went to meet Wendy Ngua Rocker here one of the events organizers and co-founder
26:53.520 - 27:01.380:  of Pan-African bookstore summer Nami books the inaugural african book fair is a culmination
27:01.380 - 27:07.220:  of a journey that we started I think as soon as we opened and was always an inspiration behind
27:07.360 - 27:17.500:  what we're doing which is to represent and explore and champion african writing and when we started
27:17.500 - 27:24.480:  the bookstore we realized that there was a huge dominance of certain countries for instance Nigeria
27:24.480 - 27:30.480:  writers Kanye and writers and we thought to ourselves what happens in all these other spaces
27:31.360 - 27:36.640:  and so we've been on this journey which we dubbed the road to 54 which is an attempt to host
27:37.360 - 27:43.800:  all the 54 states of africa in the store or as some form of representation and when we started
27:43.800 - 27:50.400:  that journey I think in 2021 without it was gonna be easy but it's been a long time coming we're almost
27:50.400 - 27:56.720:  there and so for us the fair is also like a celebration of that journey I mean I think that's
27:56.720 - 28:01.400:  really true I always feel that I lose out on reading stories and experiences from other languages
28:01.400 - 28:05.900:  it's often Nigeria of course anglophone countries are dominant and even living in Kenya means that
28:05.900 - 28:11.320:  we're reading a lot of English Swahili literature so for you one of the things that you think you
28:11.320 - 28:15.720:  want people to experience with this festival and with some of the events that you've been hosting
28:16.280 - 28:19.540:  to give prominence to african literature from various parts of the continent
28:20.880 - 28:28.100:  what is key for us is to first of all say that this story is exist right that's just because that you
28:28.100 - 28:33.520:  have not had exposure to what happens in Cameroon or what happens in Chad it doesn't mean that
28:33.520 - 28:39.560:  their no story is coming out of there so it's that showcase and I think for anyone coming to
28:39.560 - 28:45.880:  the fair they'll see in the curation you'll get to travel the continents and getting 10,000
28:45.880 - 28:50.580:  books is it feels like a logistical nightmare taxes tend to be higher than imports in Kenya
28:51.040 - 28:56.240:  and publication companies are not as robust or vibrant how are you coordinating with publishers and
28:56.240 - 29:00.520:  authors to make sure that those were time the festival get access to all of these books
29:01.820 - 29:08.800:  it's not been easy we've had to establish connections and relations with a lot of indie publishers
29:09.460 - 29:14.080:  just this week we're expecting a couple of books coming all the way from essay on road
29:14.960 - 29:21.580:  so but we do what we must just because we believe it's very important
29:22.460 - 29:26.440:  there are always these general statements made that Kenyans don't read and those even
29:26.440 - 29:31.100:  one famous author who apparently said that East Africa is a bit of a desert when it comes to literary
29:31.100 - 29:38.420:  production what do you have to say to that oh obviously they are wrong right just by the
29:38.420 - 29:45.380:  maya fact that bookstores exists and have been existing for decades right and that even people
29:45.380 - 29:52.640:  like us or Manami can start and have a viable business going so therefore just from that perspective
29:53.240 - 30:00.740:  Kenyans are reading we could have a more robust reading culture but I also see that as an issue
30:00.740 - 30:06.880:  of supply and not demand what kind of books are readily available what kind of books
30:07.480 - 30:14.340:  is your regular bookstore stocking people are very hungry for the kinds of stories that
30:15.240 - 30:20.580:  mirror their experiences that explains their circumstances their dreams the aspirations
30:21.600 - 30:25.260:  if you give people books that they can relate to then they'll read more
30:26.340 - 30:32.060:  Wendy and Joroque of Nairobi's Pan-African bookstore speaking to my colleague Beverly Occiang
30:33.080 - 30:38.480:  the US has managed to avoid crashing out of the women's world cup but only by the skin of their
30:38.480 - 30:44.100:  teeth and the width of a goalpost the defending champions drew nil nil against Portugal to
30:44.100 - 30:49.720:  scrape through to the final 16 these football fans express their disappointment at the performance
30:49.720 - 30:55.360:  of the one-time favorites oh man it was a clentro I was really hoping that they were going to
30:55.520 - 30:59.520:  you know get it at the end but it wasn't quite there I don't think the US played there
31:00.000 - 31:05.160:  like potential it was a little scary honestly I think we could have played a lot better it was
31:05.160 - 31:12.640:  a little messy and Portugal gave us room for our money pretty lackluster uh yeah as a little
31:12.640 - 31:19.020:  disconnected what do you think yeah um but uh hopefully can come back to the other be better next time
31:19.800 - 31:25.660:  as shymicaleal reports from Auckland the US face a difficult road ahead do you want the good news
31:25.660 - 31:31.580:  are the bad news first jenna good news i'll tell you i'll tell you the good news the good news is
31:31.580 - 31:37.680:  they're through to the knockout stages the good news is they are now they've been undefeated for
31:37.680 - 31:42.620:  their last 18 matches in the world cup which is their longest streak of being undefeated that's
31:42.620 - 31:48.640:  just about it in terms of good news because the bad news is it was almost like watching a different
31:48.640 - 31:53.820:  team when the US were playing Portugal it just did not feel that we were watching the defending
31:53.820 - 31:59.800:  champions playing a crucial game that was going to determine whether or not they stay in this
31:59.800 - 32:06.720:  tournament if if you're a US fan this is an almost unbelievable scenario they have dominated this
32:06.720 - 32:12.420:  game for the last decade they've won the last two women's world cups they are hot favorites
32:12.460 - 32:18.000:  to win a record third consecutive one and they're the top of their rankings they are the world number
32:18.000 - 32:23.860:  one this women's team and yet if you watched them today they just they were incoherent they didn't
32:23.860 - 32:31.080:  gel they lost chances they felt a bit scattered and all over the place megan rapino came towards the
32:31.080 - 32:36.680:  end of the game and replace sefia smith who's a debutant who's a rising star and she did make a
32:36.680 - 32:40.780:  bit of a difference her her experience made a bit of a difference but not enough difference to find
32:40.780 - 32:47.420:  the back of the net and towards the end of that match it just looked like they might be knocked out
32:47.500 - 32:52.960:  I was preparing for the most dramatic story of the world's cup because Portugal kicked a ball the
32:52.960 - 32:59.120:  hit a ball that actually got into the the post it hit the post and you could just hear the collective
32:59.120 - 33:04.160:  intake of breasts around you really because it was this moment where everyone was looking at
33:04.160 - 33:08.560:  each other thinking is this going to change everything and again you just wouldn't think that
33:08.560 - 33:13.340:  the United States would be in that position does anyone have any explanation for what's going on here
33:13.460 - 33:18.300:  yes I've been chatting to fans I've been chatting to sports journalists I've actually been chatting
33:18.300 - 33:23.080:  to a a sports journalist Jeff Kassouf who specializes in women's football and who's been following
33:23.080 - 33:27.860:  the team's stratospheric rise and he was telling me look this is a team that's used to being on top
33:27.860 - 33:32.800:  of the world but this is a team that's wobbling at the moment and I think the two main reasons are
33:32.800 - 33:38.500:  they have you know they've been suffering with injuries they've had key players not not taking part
33:38.500 - 33:43.620:  in the tournament not taking part in games but also there is a generational difference so you've
33:43.620 - 33:49.220:  got experienced superstars household names like Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe but you've also got
33:49.220 - 33:54.800:  the newcomers like Sophia Smith, Galisa Thompson, Trinity Rodman they're excellent players but they're
33:54.800 - 33:59.360:  much much younger and very inexperienced and what's happening right now is that you're getting
33:59.360 - 34:04.960:  those two different kinds of players almost playing playing with each other for almost the first time
34:04.960 - 34:08.880:  I actually think that the first game that they played some of these players had never played with
34:08.880 - 34:12.640:  each other before and you can just translate some of the page that they're just they're not
34:12.640 - 34:17.740:  jelling they're not playing as a coherent unit and of course Portugal who are very disciplined
34:17.740 - 34:24.140:  who press very very hard who are very persistent have created so many chances in the USA box
34:24.280 - 34:28.900:  there were actually tweets about spectators US spectators booing in the stands because they were so
34:28.900 - 34:33.540:  frustrated so I think all in all yes they've gone through but if you look at the table right now
34:33.540 - 34:37.360:  and you look at the Netherlands game that was happening at the same time the Netherlands were
34:37.640 - 34:42.280:  dominant and yes they were playing an inexperienced team like Vietnam but they dominated
34:43.480 - 34:49.540:  Shima Khalil reporting and that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the
34:49.540 - 34:53.620:  global news podcast later if you want to comment on this podcast the topics covered you can send
