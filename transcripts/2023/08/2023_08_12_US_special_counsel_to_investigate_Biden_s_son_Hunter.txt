01:08.320 - 01:11.600:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
01:13.020 - 01:16.280:  I'm Andrew Peachan in the early hours of Saturday 12 August.
01:16.280 - 01:17.840:  These are our main stories.
01:18.500 - 01:22.840:  The US Attorney General has given a federal prosecutor extra powers to investigate
01:22.840 - 01:28.040:  President Joe Biden's son Hunter over allegations of improper business dealings overseas.
01:28.700 - 01:32.400:  Police in Brazil have searched the homes of four people connected to the form of
01:32.400 - 01:36.460:  President Jaya Bolsonaro as part of an investigation into a ledge fraud.
01:37.160 - 01:41.340:  The authorities in Hawaii have begun partially reopening a town on the island of Maui.
01:41.620 - 01:43.600:  It's been devastated by wildfires.
01:45.380 - 01:49.360:  Also in this podcast, state authorities in California have approved the expansion of
01:49.360 - 01:52.040:  driverless taxi services in San Francisco.
01:52.780 - 01:56.380:  I have not taken one. I actually called one the other week.
01:56.380 - 02:00.320:  But what happened next will find out later in the Global News Podcast.
02:04.280 - 02:08.380:  First, the prosecutor who filed criminal charges against President Biden's son Hunter
02:08.760 - 02:12.360:  has been given the additional powers of a United States special council.
02:12.360 - 02:17.760:  David Weiss will now investigate whether Hunter Biden engaged in improper business dealings.
02:18.260 - 02:23.220:  Mr Weiss was appointed to the role as special council by the US Attorney General Merrick Garland.
02:23.920 - 02:27.840:  As special council, he will continue to have the authority and responsibility
02:27.860 - 02:34.360:  that he has previously exercised to oversee the investigation and decide where, when,
02:34.360 - 02:36.160:  and whether to file charges.
02:36.620 - 02:41.260:  The move comes as Republicans in Congress threaten an impeachment inquiry into allegations
02:41.260 - 02:46.200:  that President Biden benefited from his son's business ventures in Ukraine and China.
02:46.720 - 02:49.380:  More from our correspondent in Washington, Nomea Ikbal.
02:50.140 - 02:54.920:  It's extraordinary, really, because basically it means that this year's long inquiring to Hunter Biden
02:54.920 - 02:56.960:  has entered this really unpredictable stage.
02:57.660 - 03:00.840:  So David Weiss was appointed by Donald Trump when he was president.
03:01.500 - 03:07.700:  And when Biden, Joe Biden, became president, he never removed Weiss, he allowed him to continue
03:07.700 - 03:08.620:  with the investigation.
03:09.380 - 03:13.540:  And basically what it means now is that David Weiss can essentially expand the case.
03:13.620 - 03:18.040:  And I think there will be questions on why did he agree to this plea deal that Hunter Biden
03:18.040 - 03:21.520:  entered, it fell apart last month and it was on pretty narrow charges.
03:21.780 - 03:25.360:  Hunter Biden was accused of lying on a gun form, late filing of taxes.
03:25.940 - 03:30.320:  So does David Weiss want to go for bigger charges against the president's only living son?
03:30.320 - 03:31.260:  We just don't know.
03:31.720 - 03:36.100:  And I also think this is worth remembering that it's a stunning U-turn because originally
03:36.500 - 03:40.680:  claims that Weiss was going to be made a special prosecutor was rejected by him.
03:40.800 - 03:44.440:  And it was rejected by the Attorney General, Marik Garland, who made the announcements.
03:45.080 - 03:51.100:  And so we're in this sort of weird kind of limbo, I guess, in which this plea deal is fallen apart.
03:51.100 - 03:54.120:  We don't know exactly where this investigation will go.
03:54.120 - 03:57.460:  It gives the special prosecutor more powers to investigate more things.
03:57.460 - 04:03.720:  And it could be, and I emphasize could, that Hunter Biden may possibly face a criminal indictment
04:03.720 - 04:08.540:  and a trial. That's the sort of, you know, that's the way in which a special prosecutor has been elevated.
04:08.740 - 04:12.200:  And what listeners around the world might be thinking is these allegations have been around
04:12.200 - 04:17.960:  and discussed and prominent for years, long before Joe Biden became president.
04:17.960 - 04:19.900:  Why is the process taking so long?
04:20.100 - 04:20.880:  It's interesting, isn't it?
04:20.880 - 04:25.060:  Because yes, Hunter Biden was brought up during the 2016 election campaign.
04:25.060 - 04:28.260:  If you remember one of the, I think it was the first presidential debate between
04:28.340 - 04:34.060:  President Biden, rather than candidate Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Hunter Biden came up.
04:34.480 - 04:41.780:  And arguably you could say it was one of Joe Biden's most well-known moments or liked moments
04:41.780 - 04:44.580:  by the electorate when he defended his son.
04:44.960 - 04:50.080:  Because there are lots of Americans that can relate to someone who has a trouble son.
04:50.080 - 04:54.280:  And Hunter Biden is troubled. It's very well known. Hunter Biden himself has been very public
04:54.280 - 04:57.900:  about his battles with alcohol and with drugs.
04:57.940 - 05:02.380:  But for the Republicans, the Republican party, so they're right-wing media here,
05:02.600 - 05:04.940:  nothing fives them up more than Hunter Biden.
05:05.640 - 05:09.520:  And, you know, what he's done is a lobbyist, a consultant, and a lawyer.
05:09.520 - 05:14.800:  There's evidence of, they say, of corruption. There's dealings, especially with Ukraine and China.
05:14.800 - 05:18.000:  And they think there are implications for President Biden.
05:18.420 - 05:21.620:  Hunter Biden denies all of this. President Biden denies all of this.
05:22.140 - 05:27.220:  And so this investigation is ongoing. And I guess, you know, this is probably President
05:27.220 - 05:31.300:  Biden's way of saying, look, I'm not above the law. I will allow these investigations to go on.
05:31.300 - 05:37.740:  The Department of Justice is impartial and doesn't want to get in the way of the work that they're
05:37.740 - 05:43.200:  doing. Our correspondent, Nomey Akbar, with me from Washington. Federal police agents in Brazil
05:43.200 - 05:47.880:  have searched the homes of four individuals linked to the former presidential air ball scenario.
05:47.880 - 05:52.120:  This is part of an investigation into alleged embezzlement and money laundering.
05:52.500 - 05:57.340:  Police seized items, including computers and documents belonging to three military officers
05:57.760 - 06:01.080:  and one of Mr. Bolsonaro's lawyers. Here's Leonardo Rosha.
06:01.740 - 06:06.960:  Police say Mr. Bolsonaro appropriated at least $1 million worth of official gifts
06:07.440 - 06:12.180:  given to him by fellow leaders while he was president. Among the items which went missing
06:12.180 - 06:16.020:  from the government inventory were expensive jewelry and sculptures.
06:16.540 - 06:22.000:  Four individuals are said to have sold or attempted to sell the items for cash on his behalf.
06:22.000 - 06:27.280:  The former president denies any wrongdoing. He says is the victim of political persecution
06:27.780 - 06:31.100:  by Brazil's left-wing government, which has been in power since January.
06:31.980 - 06:35.900:  Officials in Hawaii are beginning to allow people to return to the town of Lahaina,
06:35.900 - 06:42.140:  which has been almost entirely destroyed by wildfires. Only those with proof of residency or a
06:42.140 - 06:47.860:  hotel reservation are being permitted to enter. At least 55 people are known to have died on the
06:47.860 - 06:52.660:  island of Maui with many more still missing. The governor of Hawaii, Josh Green, warned the number
06:52.660 - 06:57.920:  of dead could rise. We know that many people are suffering. The fatality numbers will climb
06:57.920 - 07:03.400:  somewhat today. Everyone love your neighbors, support them because this is devastating for Maui.
07:04.040 - 07:09.220:  We probably have well over a thousand buildings that have been destroyed. Many, many hundreds of
07:09.220 - 07:14.080:  families have been displaced. We'll rebuild. The president has already, just in six hours,
07:14.600 - 07:19.020:  authorized and approved our request for emergency support. But it's going to be a long haul.
07:19.640 - 07:24.740:  One insurance firm said damage to homes and businesses in Lahaina would make losses run into
07:24.740 - 07:29.920:  hundreds of millions of dollars. Emerson Timmins lives just outside the town. After the worst
07:29.920 - 07:34.860:  of the fire died down, he cycled through the heart of Lahaina in order to get to his family
07:34.860 - 07:40.780:  30 kilometers away. And this is what he saw. Starting from one end to the other, it's absolutely
07:40.780 - 07:49.700:  gone. So you go from a thriving tropical sort of paradise old quaint little town with little
07:49.700 - 07:54.900:  mall and pop shops, palm trees, swaying in the breeze, and everything looks perfect. One day,
07:55.100 - 08:00.700:  and literally the next day, it looks like a war zone. It looks like somebody came in there and
08:00.700 - 08:06.320:  blew it up. Everything's on fire and everything's ashes. And it's almost like you're in a dream.
08:06.620 - 08:10.660:  And I had firsthand accounts from people that did escape. And they said the friends they knew
08:10.660 - 08:14.860:  got out with no clothes. The next day, they know their houses on fire. They ran out their door
08:14.860 - 08:19.340:  and didn't have time to put shoes or clothes. They were running for their lives. Other people
08:19.340 - 08:23.720:  didn't have time to get their pets. They barely got out with their with their family. Others
08:23.720 - 08:29.320:  didn't get out. And their families didn't make it. Emerson Timmins resident of Maui in Hawaii.
08:30.220 - 08:34.460:  Ukraine has sacked the heads of military recruitment for every region in the country. The
08:34.460 - 08:39.400:  mid-concerns about corruption. President Vladimir Zelensky said there were signs officials had
08:39.400 - 08:44.720:  enriched themselves illegally. Mr. Zelensky said in some cases, officials that helped to transport
08:44.720 - 08:50.000:  men out of Ukraine to avoid being drafted. The head of the Supreme Court and the head of
08:50.000 - 08:54.880:  military recruitment in Odessa have been arrested. President Zelensky also recommended that the
08:54.880 - 09:00.220:  army select replacements who have battlefield experience, saying those serving in Ukraine's
09:00.220 - 09:08.440:  military deserve more. We are dismissing all regional military commissioners. This system should
09:08.440 - 09:14.340:  be run by people who know exactly what war is. Why cynicism and bribery at a time of war
09:14.880 - 09:21.140:  is high treason. Instead, soldiers who've been through the front line who cannot be in the trenches
09:21.580 - 09:27.300:  because they're in poor health, lost their limbs, but have retained their dignity and have no
09:27.300 - 09:34.540:  cynicism, they can be entrusted with this recruitment system. Tatiana Shepchuk is a lawyer working
09:34.540 - 09:39.560:  for the anti-corruption action center in Kiev. Julian Marshall asked her for more details and
09:39.560 - 09:45.140:  what kind of corrupt practices have been going on. These conscription offices were not properly
09:45.140 - 09:51.640:  reformed. It was inheritance of the Soviet Union and they reform only started a few months before
09:51.640 - 09:58.660:  the full-scale invasion. So, naturally, these conscription offices were a huge source of bureaucracy,
09:58.680 - 10:04.420:  untransparent procedures, and frankly speaking corruption. That's just people were playing
10:04.420 - 10:10.560:  bribes not to be mobilized to the front lines. So, in the first months of the full-scale invasion,
10:11.120 - 10:16.740:  people just closed their eyes on the problem because there were other priorities. But recently,
10:16.740 - 10:22.920:  the huge scandal erupted in Odessa region. The journalist found that the head of this
10:22.920 - 10:30.640:  regional conscription office. He bought a mansion in Spain and then a surrogist started to check
10:30.640 - 10:39.240:  in him and his relatives and they found the entire vows of the family is around 5 million euros
10:39.240 - 10:48.520:  of unexplained assets. And of course, now when Ukrainians perceive corruption as a huge threat
10:48.520 - 10:53.120:  to national security, people frankly say that corruption is something like a treason for them
10:53.360 - 10:58.540:  during the wartime. And especially in the conscription offices because it's naturally the
10:58.540 - 11:04.380:  question of life and death for so many people. The general public was outraged on what was going on
11:04.380 - 11:10.340:  therefore the central government had to act and they started to investigate Odessa,
11:10.340 - 11:17.680:  regional conscription offices and the center and others and disclosed a lot of problems.
11:17.680 - 11:25.900:  But is the implication that all of these conscription centers were guilty of corruption and why
11:25.900 - 11:32.700:  has everyone been dismissed? The perception is that most of them are corrupt and the idea Zalensky has
11:32.800 - 11:39.480:  and the general staff they have is to change the leadership to put their officers who had
11:39.480 - 11:46.200:  recent battlefield experience. So in a way it's not just dismissing the all corrupt people
11:46.200 - 11:52.180:  but putting on the place people from the front lines. The lawyer Tatiana Shepchuk from the
11:52.180 - 11:58.100:  anti-corruption action center in Kiev. The number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to get
11:58.100 - 12:04.040:  to Europe has doubled in the past year according to official estimates. 89,000 people made the crossing
12:04.040 - 12:09.040:  between North Africa and Italy in just seven months. The European Union's Border Agency
12:09.040 - 12:13.780:  Frontex believes the number will remain high because criminal gangs are now offering low prices
12:14.200 - 12:17.820:  for migrants to make these journeys. Sophia Batista reports from Rome.
12:18.480 - 12:25.200:  The number of people caught making irregular border crossings into the EU has not been this high
12:25.200 - 12:31.980:  in the first half of the year since 2016. The main route migrants are taking is known as the
12:31.980 - 12:37.880:  Central Mediterranean route across the Mediterranean Sea between North Africa and Italy.
12:38.200 - 12:44.680:  Tunisia's eastern coast has overtaken neighbouring Libya as the region's main point of departure.
12:45.280 - 12:50.520:  Frontex says a large number of people come from Egypt, Guinea and Ivory Coast,
12:51.240 - 12:57.240:  fleeing war and persecution. The crossing is one of the most dangerous in the world for migrants.
12:58.100 - 13:03.680:  So far this year more than 2,000 people have thought to have died in the Mediterranean.
13:04.280 - 13:11.660:  And this week 41 people lost their lives after their boats sank near the Italian island of Lampedusa.
13:12.100 - 13:17.700:  But Frontex predicts that these deaths won't stop others from making the journey.
13:17.700 - 13:23.280:  It says there is fierce competition among criminal groups, which means that smugglers are
13:23.360 - 13:30.700:  offering lower prices. The fear is that many more migrants will die trying to reach Europe for a better
13:30.700 - 13:36.160:  life. Now soon you might be able to hail a driver's taxi in California with just a few taps
13:36.160 - 13:41.460:  of your mobile phone. This after the authorities approved the expansion of such a service in San
13:41.460 - 13:47.640:  Francisco. Two operators, Waymo and Cruz have now been allowed to run fully commercial so-called
13:47.640 - 13:55.060:  Robo Taxi Services in the city 24-7. San Francisco first introduced driverless cars in 2014
13:55.060 - 14:00.780:  with a mandatory human safety driver on board. Currently it's only a limited service,
14:00.780 - 14:06.480:  but they hope to expand to other cities in the US. Stephen Kounsor is a tech reporter from SF Gate,
14:06.480 - 14:11.460:  a digital outlet in San Francisco. He told me what these driverless taxis look like.
14:12.260 - 14:20.180:  They are very similar to regular cars, but they do have some hallmarks of 21st century technology
14:20.180 - 14:26.660:  for sure. They have this creepy quietness that electric cars often have. They also have instruments
14:26.660 - 14:34.780:  on the top of the cars spinning cameras that act as radar systems that let them see the entire
14:34.780 - 14:40.100:  surroundings of the street and operate without anyone driving in the front seat. It's a pretty
14:40.100 - 14:44.800:  startling to see them every time, even though living in San Francisco I've seen hundreds now.
14:44.800 - 14:50.900:  So they're obviously using sat-nav technology to know where they're going and then they're using
14:50.900 - 14:55.520:  technology attached to the vehicle to make sure they don't hit anything. That's right. It's all very
14:55.520 - 15:02.280:  camera-focused. I think there were things in the works in the past to try to make it very GPS-oriented,
15:02.280 - 15:07.900:  but modern day autonomous vehicles really use these cameras and radars on the top because they know
15:07.900 - 15:12.460:  that they're going to have to be, you know, lightning fast and avoiding pedestrians, bicyclists,
15:12.460 - 15:17.180:  other vehicles and navigating through a very dense and busy city in San Francisco.
15:17.440 - 15:22.100:  And they must work otherwise they wouldn't be allowed to expand like this. How do people
15:22.100 - 15:27.020:  feel about them though? Are people happy to get in these vehicles and get from a to-be using them
15:27.020 - 15:33.840:  feeling safe? They do work and there has not been any fatalities from crashes, which is a big
15:33.840 - 15:40.300:  selling point for the companies up to this point. At the meeting yesterday where the commission in
15:40.300 - 15:46.240:  California okayed the expansion of fared vehicle rides by these two companies though dozens and
15:46.240 - 15:51.960:  dozens of San Francisco residents spoke out against the expansion calling on complaints made by
15:51.960 - 15:56.840:  the fire department in San Francisco as well as the municipal transportation authorities about
15:57.300 - 16:02.380:  cars getting in the way of first responders and the streets slowing down and stopping when police
16:02.380 - 16:06.720:  cars are coming and just not really knowing quite how to act in emergency situations.
16:07.100 - 16:11.620:  That's interesting. So they're on the roster, a list of objections if you like of situations
16:11.620 - 16:16.900:  that they're not sophisticated enough to respond properly to. Yeah, that's right. You know,
16:16.940 - 16:22.240:  there's also worries about more traffic in San Francisco, you know, taking away taxi drivers
16:22.240 - 16:27.180:  and Uber drivers jobs, but I think some of the main complaints so far have been those ones with
16:27.560 - 16:33.140:  first responders and emergency situations. And does it feel as though we're just going to see more
16:33.140 - 16:37.920:  and more of this, you know, expanding across towns and cities in California and then across the
16:37.920 - 16:42.280:  rest of the US and then across the rest of the world? These cars have massive corporate backing.
16:42.280 - 16:47.560:  I mean, the two companies that just got okayed yesterday are owned by General Motors, which is one
16:47.560 - 16:52.480:  of the biggest American car manufacturers and Google. So these companies have billions of dollars
16:52.480 - 16:58.200:  to pour into these two sort of startups and they're just going to keep growing. Are they cheaper
16:58.200 - 17:03.860:  than a taxi? Right now, they're about the same price as an Uber and a lift, but these companies are
17:03.860 - 17:08.280:  losing huge amounts of money in the development of these cars. So it's unclear how much they actually
17:08.280 - 17:13.740:  cost debris. And presumably taxi drivers, taxi firms are beyond the list of people objecting.
17:14.000 - 17:18.540:  There were lots of taxi drivers at the meeting yesterday speaking out against the, you know,
17:18.540 - 17:23.980:  pros of having a human driver in your car and speaking out against the driverless cars
17:23.980 - 17:28.900:  of proliferating across the city. Have you taken one yourself? I have not taken one. I actually
17:28.900 - 17:34.480:  called one the other week and it was approaching me and then it canceled and I thought, well,
17:34.480 - 17:39.480:  there's no human driver to cancel this ride. What's happened? It canceled you. What were we
17:39.480 - 17:45.180:  doing? Why? You know, maybe it was because I'm a journalist. Steven council, who's a tech reporter
17:45.180 - 17:58.340:  in San Francisco. Still to come. Cool. Herk is revered as the founder of hip hop. The springboard,
17:58.340 - 18:03.180:  the big bang moment they say. It's 50 years since hip hop was born at a back to school
18:03.220 - 18:15.000:  party in the Bronx in New York. Do you ever feel a bit overwhelmed when you check the news on
18:15.000 - 18:19.980:  your phone first thing in the morning? Whenever I open up my phone, they're just endless warnings
18:19.980 - 18:24.900:  of more extreme weather to come. I'm Hannah. I'm the presenter of a new podcast called What in the
18:24.900 - 18:29.980:  World from the BBC World Service. We're going to be here trying to help you make sense of the world
18:29.980 - 18:35.680:  around you so you can feel a little bit better about what's happening in the world. You can find
18:35.680 - 18:42.040:  what in the world wherever you get your BBC podcasts. Welcome back to the global news podcast.
18:42.040 - 18:48.220:  The UN says five of its security staff who were kidnapped in Yemen 18 months ago have been freed.
18:48.780 - 18:54.040:  Yemen has been devastated by civil war since 2014, though much of the fighting has recently
18:54.040 - 18:59.520:  subsided. The UN resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, David Gressley, said the release
18:59.520 - 19:05.560:  of the five staff was great news. I'm pleased to report that they're in harm in good health and
19:05.560 - 19:13.020:  good spirits, a chance to speak with them obviously on the way back. I'm very much impressed by not
19:13.020 - 19:19.160:  only their good spirits, but the strength that they have exhibited under extraordinary circumstances.
19:19.860 - 19:25.020:  Let's get more on this from Mike Thompson. It's clear from the comments of one of the five security
19:25.140 - 19:32.180:  staff reportedly kidnapped by Al Qaeda that their experiences were deeply traumatic. A calm,
19:32.180 - 19:38.480:  soft-yole an arm, a former army lieutenant colonel from Bangladesh has described his experiences
19:38.500 - 19:45.700:  as horrifying. He said he didn't see the sky for months and lived with the fear of death every day.
19:45.780 - 19:53.420:  The terror he added can't be expressed in words and is only seen in films. Soon after arriving
19:53.420 - 19:57.860:  back in Ducca, he told reporters he never thought he'd come home.
19:58.980 - 20:03.940:  Next to Niger and hundreds of supporters of the coup leaders in the country held a demonstration
20:03.940 - 20:08.160:  on Friday near a French military base on the outskirts of the capital Niammi.
20:08.560 - 20:13.300:  Protesters shouted slogans against the former colonial power in Niger as well as the regional
20:13.300 - 20:19.680:  block Ekkoos. France has about 1,500 military personnel in the country who were helping to
20:19.680 - 20:25.820:  combat Jihadist insurgents. On Thursday, Ekkoos ordered the activation of a standby force to
20:25.820 - 20:32.020:  go into Niger to restore constitutional order. Africa, regional editor Richard Hamilton considers
20:32.020 - 20:38.620:  what could happen next. Military intervention appears to be edging closer. We still don't know what
20:38.620 - 20:45.240:  it might look like or even when a regional force might go into action. But the Ekkoos commissioner
20:45.240 - 20:51.440:  for political affairs, Abdul Fatal Musa said an element of uncertainty is necessary.
20:51.440 - 20:59.800:  Any time from now, the force could be deployed. And for operational reasons, we have to maintain
20:59.860 - 21:09.420:  a strategic ambiguity when we are willing to deploy the force. If the junta in Niger decides
21:10.080 - 21:16.280:  between now and the deployment that they are ready to talk and they are ready to restore
21:16.280 - 21:23.040:  constitutional order, then we will pause in preparation for deployment. Nigeria has the most
21:23.040 - 21:29.840:  powerful voice within Ekkoos and its president, Bollatinubu, has argued in favor of a force going
21:29.840 - 21:37.920:  in. But Beatrice de Leon Kobo, an analyst specializing in conflict in the Sahel, says a war in Niger
21:37.920 - 21:43.760:  could have catastrophic consequences. I think, unfortunately, if there is some military intervention,
21:43.760 - 21:49.500:  it's going to run out of control. No one wants to come to this point. Nobody, not nor the neighbors,
21:49.500 - 21:55.360:  not the junta, nor Nigeria, nobody wants a war in West Africa. Because we need to understand
21:55.360 - 22:01.300:  it's not all the countries of Ekkoos against New York Junta is that Burkina Faso and Mali will
22:01.300 - 22:06.460:  support the CNSP. This could be very dangerous. And unfortunately, I don't think this is something
22:06.460 - 22:11.360:  that any of the military could really do at this moment, because they are already in war,
22:11.360 - 22:16.460:  most of these countries against zihadism. So I fear this is only going to create more losses
22:16.680 - 22:21.960:  of civilians, and especially that the violent extremism groups, zihadists and criminal organizations
22:21.960 - 22:26.880:  are going to thrive in these chaos, and that's going to be terrible for the future of West Africa.
22:27.300 - 22:33.200:  The coup leaders maintain that they stepped in because of the deteriorating security situation
22:33.200 - 22:40.360:  in the country. But under President Bazoum, things were actually improving. Now Africa confidential,
22:40.360 - 22:46.700:  a newsletter that provides analysis about the continent suggests that other motives may also
22:46.700 - 22:52.640:  have been at play. It says that when the previous president, Mahamadu Isafu, was in power,
22:53.140 - 23:01.060:  nearly half the defense budget, more than $125 million, were diverted into private hands.
23:01.220 - 23:07.660:  And just when officials were reopening their inquiries into individuals linked to that scandal,
23:07.660 - 23:14.140:  President Bazoum was overthrown. The coup leader, Abdur Aman Chiani, was the head of the
23:14.140 - 23:22.020:  presidential guard under Mahamadu Isafu, and it was reported that the new president was about to sack him.
23:22.760 - 23:28.460:  The Norwegian mountaineer, Christin Harilah, has denied accusations her team climbed over an
23:28.460 - 23:34.100:  injured guide who later died during a bid to break a world record. The porter, named as
23:34.100 - 23:39.580:  Mohammed Hassan, had fallen off a ledge on K2 in Pakistan, the world's second highest mountain.
23:40.060 - 23:45.940:  Here's Bethany Bell. Two climbers, Philip Fleming from Germany and Wilhelm Steinald from Austria,
23:45.940 - 23:51.460:  say they have drone footage which appears to show people climbing over Mohammed Hassan
23:51.740 - 23:57.480:  on an extremely narrow path on the mountain side. The pair who were filming a documentary were
23:57.480 - 24:02.860:  also on the mountain that day, but had cancelled their ascent because of dangerous weather conditions.
24:04.000 - 24:08.960:  As their camera display was small, they say they saw the details of what their drone captured
24:08.960 - 24:15.500:  only the next day. But in a statement on Instagram, Christin Harilah said she and her team had tried
24:15.500 - 24:20.780:  everything to help Mr Hassan, who was part of a separate team in dangerous conditions.
24:21.840 - 24:25.080:  She denied accusations that Mr Hassan had been left to die.
24:25.800 - 24:31.500:  Ms Harilah said no one was to blame for his death, adding she decided to make the statement to stop
24:31.500 - 24:37.300:  the spread of what she called misinformation and hatred. Now football, the England men's
24:37.300 - 24:42.340:  captain Harry Kane is in Germany where he's expected to finalise his transfer from Tottenham
24:42.340 - 24:48.200:  Hotspur to Bayern Munich. The two clubs have agreed a fear of more than $109 million for Tottenham's
24:48.200 - 24:53.580:  record goal scorer. From Munich, here's Joe Inwood. He is Tottenham's talismanic striker
24:53.980 - 25:00.560:  and England's captain. Harry Kane's been with Spurs for 19 years. Now at the age of 30,
25:00.560 - 25:05.640:  that looks all but certain to change. It's long been rumoured that Harry Kane wanted to leave
25:05.640 - 25:10.500:  North London and a club where his prodigious talent had never been rewarded with silverware.
25:11.100 - 25:17.380:  A Bayern Munich trophies are all but guaranteed. Outside the Allianz Arena, fans were excited
25:17.380 - 25:22.680:  about the arrival of a new number nine. He's an international player who knows the game and
25:22.680 - 25:27.780:  who's very skilled so he can only prove the team. So looking forward to seeing him playing.
25:28.160 - 25:35.740:  So I'm excited but last year Manny didn't go as we planned so we'll see but I hope hopefully.
25:36.020 - 25:40.740:  I think German club is proud to take one of the best English soccer players.
25:41.220 - 25:45.820:  That's big for Germany I think, yeah. That joy in Germany will mirror the
25:45.820 - 25:51.440:  despondency in North London where they have lost undoubtedly their best player just hours before
25:51.440 - 25:56.400:  the start of the new season. The Spurs manager, Angeposterkoglu, knew a deal was imminent.
25:56.820 - 25:59.560:  From that perspective it was just sort of some clarity,
26:00.680 - 26:04.560:  unless something else was seen happens that we moving forward and certainly with
26:04.560 - 26:07.820:  training tonight and preparing for brain food we're going with that Harry.
26:08.160 - 26:12.040:  As for Bayern, they start their season with a cup clash against RB Leipzig.
26:12.680 - 26:15.360:  It seems unlikely Harry Kane will arrive in time for that,
26:16.100 - 26:20.080:  but with his talent expect one of England's greatest ever strikers
26:20.600 - 26:22.820:  to quickly make his mark on the Bundesliga.
26:23.520 - 26:28.840:  Joe Inwood in Germany. 50 years ago yesterday on the 11th of August 1973,
26:28.900 - 26:34.920:  the music genre Hip Hop was born at a back-to-school party in an apartment building in the Bronx
26:34.920 - 26:41.160:  in New York. The DJ Clive Campbell known as Call Herk used two turntables to isolate and repeat
26:41.160 - 26:46.320:  instrumental breaks in tracks by the likes of James Brown and Curtis Mayfield.
26:46.320 - 26:49.540:  He mixed between them to create a continuous flow of music.
26:50.160 - 26:54.680:  It's grown to influence pretty much everything from politics to culture, language to fashion,
26:54.680 - 26:57.420:  and it's created legends like Grandmaster Flash,
26:57.420 - 27:04.040:  Rondy MC and Missy Elliott. The broadcaster and DJ Trevor Nelson delves into the origins of Hip Hop.
27:07.980 - 27:14.700:  Call Herk is revered as the founder of Hip Hop. The springboard, the big bang moment they say.
27:15.360 - 27:24.140:  Basically it's DJ who took a beat from a record and extended that beat by playing the same beat
27:26.300 - 27:33.240:  on another turntable and extending it to make it simple. If you imagine Queen
27:33.240 - 27:39.060:  another one bites the dust, the beginning of that. Imagine that with no vocal
27:40.820 - 27:44.500:  and somebody extends the beginning again so it just keeps going round like an instrumental.
27:48.480 - 27:52.680:  If somebody said another one bites the dust and then he just spun it back and said another one
27:52.740 - 28:00.060:  but you know just extended that basically as simple as that is is the essence of DJ turn
28:00.060 - 28:07.620:  tableism and hip hop. Hip Hop is more than just a form of music. It's easy to say it's
28:07.820 - 28:11.960:  rap or hip hop isn't it, it's not, it's a lifestyle. It really was and it still is.
28:16.340 - 28:21.960:  In poor parts of America, especially in the 16th century like New York, Hispanics and Blacks,
28:22.100 - 28:25.560:  what the lowest rung are they ladder? Do you know what I mean? Entertainment for them would have been
28:25.560 - 28:30.460:  hanging out on the street, doing throwing little block parties, being anything to entertain themselves
28:30.460 - 28:34.960:  because they didn't have money to go to posh places. So that's, I think that was the driving force of
28:34.960 - 28:38.980:  hip hop. That's why hip hop became this cultural phenomenon and it wasn't just about the music,
28:39.400 - 28:44.160:  it was the dancing, it was the graffiti, there were several elements to hip hop and that is what
28:44.160 - 28:49.120:  hip hop is and people get confused with what hip hop is, that is hip hop. The culture is turntableism,
28:49.120 - 28:55.120:  graffiti and dancing. Well I first encountered hip hop as a young young man when I heard rappers
28:55.120 - 29:00.440:  still like and I thought my gosh that is the most amazing, fun song I've ever heard in my life
29:00.560 - 29:04.280:  and I think a lot of people thought it was a one-hit wonder, it was just one of those novelty records.
29:07.220 - 29:12.500:  For me it became serious when Grandmaster Flash and a few as far I've released a tune a few years
29:25.140 - 29:27.340:  ago called The Message. It struck me, it hit me on the head like a
29:27.340 - 29:33.240:  manate. Lyrically it was, I've never forgotten the lyrics of that song, you know, don't push me
29:33.240 - 29:37.060:  because I'm close to the edge, I'm trying not to lose my head, it's like a jungle sometimes,
29:37.060 - 29:48.340:  it makes me wonder how I keep from going under. And it's about the struggle living in the hood,
29:48.340 - 29:53.700:  those two records sum up where hip hop was going to go. Party, Braggadocia, flashy,
29:53.700 - 30:02.220:  ghetto fabulous, jewelry, escapism, aspiration and politics, reality, truth, my struggle and
30:02.440 - 30:05.500:  those have been the two mainstays of hip hop since that day.
30:09.320 - 30:11.380:  Trevor Nelson on The Origins of Hip Hop.
