00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:20.620:  by advertising. That 56 seconds, it took me to swim that gold medal when I looked for that feeling
00:20.620 - 00:28.200:  for 30 years and I never found it. A podcast about the people behind the medals.
00:29.020 - 00:34.240:  On the podium from the BBC World Service, find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
00:37.300 - 00:40.660:  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:42.680 - 00:46.820:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this at 13 hours GMT on Wednesday,
00:46.820 - 00:52.720:  the 23rd of August. India becomes the first country to land a spacecraft on the South Pole
00:52.940 - 00:58.960:  of the Moon. Zimbabweans vote in a presidential election after a campaign marred by clamped down on
00:58.960 - 01:04.640:  the opposition and Republican US presidential candidates prepare for their first debate but without
01:04.640 - 01:12.560:  Donald Trump. Also on the podcast, once you termally decompose the materials so that all the smell
01:12.560 - 01:17.200:  and everything goes away, so it's same material like sand. It doesn't, I mean, any sort of smell.
01:17.680 - 01:22.260:  Could recycled coffee grounds help produce stronger building materials?
01:26.740 - 01:33.480:  In space terms, its budget was relatively small at just $75 million but India's successful
01:33.480 - 01:40.520:  mission to the Moon is likely to have a big impact. Currently only two engines are now being fired
01:41.560 - 01:48.580:  and we are nearly at zero velocity, vertical and horizontal. We were hovering and now we are
01:49.260 - 01:50.640:  approaching the Moon's surface.
02:05.280 - 02:11.060:  So after its six-week journey from Earth, the Chundrian 3 became the first craft to touch down
02:11.060 - 02:17.240:  at the Luna South Pole, making India only the fourth nation to achieve a soft landing on the Moon
02:17.240 - 02:23.720:  after the USSR, America and China. The achievement is even more impressive given the high failure rate
02:23.720 - 02:30.220:  in recent missions, including Russia's Luna 25, which crashed on Sunday. India's Prime Minister
02:30.220 - 02:35.060:  Narendra Modi addressed mission control via video link from a summit in South Africa.
02:35.580 - 02:48.520:  Our Moon mission is also based on the same human centric approach. Therefore, this success belongs
02:48.520 - 02:56.760:  to all our humanity. Over the next 14 days, the mission is due to search for frozen water, which
02:56.760 - 03:02.460:  could help support a future base on the Moon as well as deeper space missions. Our correspondent
03:02.460 - 03:09.240:  in India, Archana Shukla, gave us this update. Well, it was pin drop silence seconds before
03:09.240 - 03:16.620:  Vikram Lander touched on the South Pole surface on the Moon, but just as it did, this planetarium
03:16.620 - 03:23.740:  here, full of people waiting for that moment, burst out, clapping, hugging each other, distributing
03:23.740 - 03:30.240:  sweets and also chanting patriotic slogans because India created history and it was a proud
03:30.240 - 03:36.520:  moment here for Indians who were watching this historic moment. I have some of the astronomy
03:36.520 - 03:43.380:  enthusiasts here who were watching that moment. Yes, what did you feel when Vikram Lander touched
03:43.380 - 03:48.260:  on the Moon? First of all, I would like to congratulate Istro scientists and engineers and all
03:48.260 - 03:54.960:  Indians that Chandran 3 have achieved this mark. And yes, I am really feeling happy that Chandran 3
03:54.960 - 04:03.540:  have softly landed in the South Pole of Moon. Actually, this mission is a complex mission that
04:03.540 - 04:10.000:  to land on South Pole of Moon, but we have did it, so I am really feeling happy.
04:10.400 - 04:16.620:  Right. And Mr. Sanjay, you were also here clapping actively and I saw you having sweets a lot
04:16.620 - 04:22.120:  and distributing it. A proud moment as an Indian. Exactly, a proud moment and the legacy
04:22.760 - 04:32.980:  nearuput of a scientific attitude that has given us this opportunity to celebrate and Istro
04:32.980 - 04:41.160:  like institutions are creating history and for India it is great and for particularly for youth.
04:41.720 - 04:50.320:  Now they will be going for science, background, education. Brilliant and this is the feeling across
04:50.320 - 04:56.540:  the country, one of pride, one of happiness for the achievement that India has made and created
04:56.540 - 05:02.620:  history to be the first country to land on the South Pole of the Moon. Our correspondent in India
05:02.620 - 05:08.180:  are Chana Shukla. Hopes of a brighter future for Zimbabwe after the overthrow of Robert
05:08.180 - 05:16.200:  McGarby in 2017 have long since faded with sky high inflation, 65% unemployment and currency shortages.
05:16.820 - 05:22.860:  The man who took over, Emerson Manangagua, has a fearsome reputation. Known as the crocodile,
05:22.860 - 05:27.680:  he was the security minister at the time of the Matabili land massacres in the 1980s.
05:28.160 - 05:33.340:  And going into today's election, he has followed the McGarby playbook in clamping down on the
05:33.340 - 05:38.880:  opposition, throwing people into jail, criminalizing dissent and blocking some foreign media
05:38.880 - 05:44.960:  organizations from entring Zimbabwe. And as he cast his ballot, President Manangagua said he was
05:44.980 - 05:48.740:  confident of victory. If I think I'm not going to take it then I'll be foolish.
05:49.940 - 05:53.400:  And everyone who can't test if you're going to rest, you're going to rest to win,
05:54.180 - 05:59.540:  end the precise resort I'm doing. The opposition leader Nelson Chimesa is hoping to end
05:59.540 - 06:06.200:  43 years of Zanu-PF rule, but he fears a repeat of the vote rigging that he says cost him victory
06:06.200 - 06:12.560:  in the 2018 poll. With the economy in the doldrums, these voters in the capital Harari are just
06:30.980 - 06:34.300:  hoping for a better future. I came as early as four in the morning to vote for our old man,
06:34.300 - 06:43.140:  President Manangagua. After we vote, we're expecting a good leader who's going to lead peacefully.
06:43.140 - 06:48.740:  So how is voting going? I spoke to our correspondent in Harari Shingai Nyoka.
06:49.060 - 06:54.340:  It depends where you are. Earlier on, we were in Bayre, which is just outside the city center,
06:54.340 - 07:00.300:  and there was a high turnout of people, even though the polling stations opened slightly later,
07:00.300 - 07:07.500:  an hour later than the official time. So they opened at 8 a.m. But we've moved to another location,
07:07.540 - 07:13.200:  another township to the west of the capital in Kuala Zana, where people have been waiting
07:13.200 - 07:17.800:  some as early as six o'clock to cost their vote, and they've been told that the ballot papers
07:17.800 - 07:23.540:  aren't ready yet. So the people that I've spoke that I spoke to said that hundreds of people
07:23.540 - 07:29.260:  have already left because they were frustrated, and they didn't know why they're such a delay
07:29.260 - 07:33.440:  with these ballot papers. But some are saying that they will stay until they arrive,
07:33.440 - 07:38.060:  because they want to cost their vote. Now Nelson Chameza, the opposition leader,
07:38.520 - 07:44.660:  says he was robbed at the last election in 2018. What are the chances of the opposition ending
07:44.660 - 07:50.740:  Zanu P.F. rule here? It's incredibly difficult, and Nelson Chameza is 45 years of age,
07:51.240 - 07:56.680:  Emerson Manangagua, who he's competing against, has been in politics longer than he's been alive,
07:57.280 - 08:03.280:  and Zanu P.F. has a reputation for winning by enemies necessary. Even though
08:03.280 - 08:07.620:  President Emerson Manangagua has said that this vote will be fair, it will be credible,
08:07.680 - 08:11.880:  it will be transparent. There were already concerns in the run-up to the polls,
08:12.640 - 08:19.420:  in respect of the number of opposition rallies that were banned. We were told over 100,
08:20.380 - 08:26.140:  and also the number of opposition activists that were arrested, sometimes when they were
08:26.140 - 08:30.820:  conducting rallies that had been approved by the police. And so there's already concern
08:30.820 - 08:37.120:  about whether these elections will be fair as far as the opposition is concerned. And the fact
08:37.120 - 08:42.900:  that so many of their supporters in an urban area like Harare, which is known as their stronghold,
08:43.200 - 08:48.960:  that these supporters haven't been able to vote, will likely confirm to them that this vote is
08:48.960 - 08:54.460:  definitely not free and fair. Now whoever wins, Zanu P.F. is in a pretty dire state at the moment.
08:54.460 - 08:57.140:  What will be the most immediate issues to address?
08:57.680 - 09:02.340:  It's the issue that has plagued Zimbabwe for decades now, which is the economy.
09:03.060 - 09:10.760:  The inflation rate has dropped slightly over the last two months also. It was at 176 percent in
09:10.760 - 09:17.780:  June and has dropped to 77 percent. But I think a lot of people are not expecting it to stay that way.
09:18.520 - 09:24.220:  But the opposition has said that they will want to bring in new investment. They have a plan
09:24.220 - 09:31.180:  that they say to restore Zimbabwe in the family of nations. Emerson Manangagua has said that his
09:31.180 - 09:37.000:  work speak for themselves. He's already embarked on infrastructural development, including dams,
09:37.280 - 09:43.020:  drilling boreholes. So people in the rural areas can have access to clean water. And mining is also
09:43.020 - 09:48.320:  on the up. And he's saying that he will just continue those works. But I think a lot of Zimbabweans
09:48.320 - 09:54.160:  are saying that despite everything that he's done, the impact of this economic development
09:54.160 - 09:58.880:  hasn't really trickled down to ordinary people. And they're looking for a revolution which they
09:58.880 - 10:04.320:  believe the opposition can bring. Jenga Inyoka in Harari, there's a Babwean capital.
10:05.420 - 10:10.060:  When it comes to producing elite runners, few countries are as successful as Kenya.
10:10.680 - 10:15.360:  The East African nation is expected to pick up more medals at the World Athletics Championships
10:15.360 - 10:21.400:  in Hungary, currently underway. But its reputation has been tarnished in recent years by a steady
10:21.400 - 10:28.040:  stream of doping violations. To avoid a total ban, the authorities in Kenya have been given one last
10:28.040 - 10:34.700:  chance. Our correspondent Alex Kapstik in Budapest has been hearing how money and manpower are being
10:34.700 - 10:40.340:  used to tackle the problem. It's been going on for years. Big crowds in the hamstring cheering
10:40.340 - 10:46.780:  Jemima Sungong of Kenya. Here comes Keprov. And Keprov is going to make it to the gold medal.
10:52.380 - 10:57.700:  Just a few of the many high-profile Kenyan runners banned for doping violations. And the numbers
10:57.700 - 11:02.860:  keep on rising. The Wild West is an app description. Quite frankly, Kenya was facing a potential ban
11:02.860 - 11:08.420:  from all of international athletics. Brett Kloythia heads up the Athletics Integrity Unit known as the
11:08.420 - 11:14.920:  AIU. He's responsible for weeding out the cheats with Kenya a big priority. We shouldn't be
11:14.920 - 11:20.120:  fooled that this is all just unsophisticated stuff. There are people there who are conspiring with
11:20.120 - 11:26.480:  one another to commit and organise crime basically. I'm using drugs to win races and get the money
11:26.480 - 11:31.840:  shared amongst a group of conspirators. But this isn't a centralized system like we had in Russia.
11:32.320 - 11:36.880:  It's far from it. It's market-driven. So it makes it particularly challenging to do with.
11:37.260 - 11:44.320:  I'm David Rudisha, 800 meters world record holder, two times Olympic champion and two times world
11:44.320 - 11:50.000:  champion. David Rudisha, a national hero, is here in Budapest supporting Kenyan athletes
11:50.000 - 11:54.540:  at the World Championships. He's devastated by the country's record on doping.
11:54.920 - 11:59.820:  This doping issue is a cloud that has been surrounding athletics in Kenya for a long time.
12:00.400 - 12:05.380:  There are so many athletes in Kenya, 100 and 100. And by the time this person might be
12:05.380 - 12:10.900:  ended into a doping list to be tested, you find some of them are already doped.
12:10.900 - 12:16.020:  You're saying it's not a systematic doping programme. It's happening on an individual basis.
12:16.440 - 12:21.280:  Yeah, absolutely. Once somebody does something like that, you have no respect for your colleagues,
12:21.280 - 12:24.920:  you have no respect for others, and you don't respect their hard work.
12:25.100 - 12:31.340:  The use of performance enhancing drugs was a topic at the World Athletics Congress,
12:31.340 - 12:36.760:  which took place on the eve of these championships. All the national federation bosses were there,
12:37.280 - 12:42.920:  including the president of Kenyan athletics, General Jackson 2A. Part of the challenge in Kenya
12:42.920 - 12:46.760:  was they're refusal to accept the situation, but that seems to have changed.
12:46.760 - 12:51.420:  Fatahal, we acknowledge that problem is there, and we are not slipping on the job.
12:51.820 - 12:55.320:  I'm very confident that in the near future we'll be out of that.
12:55.460 - 12:58.280:  It's the problem, deliberate cheating, or is it lack of education?
12:58.640 - 13:02.620:  Well, I think it's after the athletes may be not training enough, some of them.
13:03.140 - 13:07.320:  But I think this problem also starts at very low age, even before they get to us.
13:07.640 - 13:10.420:  It's something that is weighed and is not only in athletics.
13:11.080 - 13:16.020:  The resources to fight the dopers and those helping them include a 25 million dollar war chest
13:16.020 - 13:19.300:  to ensure testing is both widespread and done properly.
13:19.940 - 13:24.100:  But it's a long-term project. The positive tests aren't going to suddenly nose-died.
13:24.100 - 13:26.760:  In fact, as the A.I.U.'s Brett Clothea explains,
13:26.760 - 13:30.760:  the action they're taking should initially have the opposite effect.
13:31.120 - 13:35.620:  The extra money in anti-Doping in Kenya will create a very deep domestic testing pool.
13:35.920 - 13:39.600:  The numbers still going up, but when will that start to reverse, do you think?
13:39.780 - 13:42.680:  What I think we'll see is more doping cases, but let's doping.
13:43.460 - 13:46.320:  Faith kick Yegon! She is the best in the world!
13:46.320 - 13:49.220:  She takes her third world championship!
13:49.720 - 13:54.780:  But amidst all the gloom here at the world championships, Kenya is making positive headlines.
13:54.780 - 14:01.700:  Faith kick Yegon, who started her career running barefoot, is celebrating an unprecedented third
14:01.700 - 14:09.280:  1,500 metres world title. And it's people like her that Kenya wants young athletes to look up to.
14:09.780 - 14:12.880:  Alex Capstick at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest.
14:13.580 - 14:17.900:  Now to the latest developments in ways of recycling food and other waste.
14:17.900 - 14:23.020:  It comes from Australia and involves using coffee grounds to make stronger concrete,
14:23.660 - 14:24.980:  as Iona Hampson reports.
14:25.480 - 14:30.160:  After water, coffee is the most popular drink worldwide, with over 400
14:30.160 - 14:35.500:  billion cups consumed each year. It's popularity results in a huge amount of waste,
14:36.000 - 14:40.520:  with 10 billion kilograms of used coffee grounds generated annually around the world,
14:41.200 - 14:42.660:  most of which goes to landfill.
14:43.560 - 14:48.880:  Now researchers in Australia have developed a technique to make concrete 30% stronger
14:48.880 - 14:54.420:  by turning waste coffee grounds into biochar, a lightweight residue similar to charcoal,
14:54.940 - 14:58.720:  which can then be used to replace a portion of the sand required to make concrete.
14:59.520 - 15:03.340:  Lead author Dr. Reggie Rochand from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
15:03.340 - 15:07.900:  explained why it is so important to give used coffee grounds a new shot at life.
15:07.900 - 15:12.020:  The waste which is ending up in landfills producing greenhouse gases due to
15:12.020 - 15:16.480:  bacterial activity that is stopped and you are converting that into a source.
15:16.660 - 15:20.760:  The money that you spend in disposing of, you can make money out of that.
15:21.120 - 15:26.020:  50 billion tonnes of natural sand is used in construction projects globally each year.
15:26.480 - 15:30.800:  It's a finite natural resource and is usually taken from riverbeds and banks,
15:30.800 - 15:32.840:  which has a big impact on the environment.
15:32.860 - 15:37.940:  Along with reducing the extraction of sand, Dr. Rochand said the process has even more
15:37.940 - 15:43.660:  benefits. This remaining byproducts can be further refined to produce many high value
15:43.660 - 15:47.160:  products like hydrogen, graphene and all sort of other materials.
15:47.360 - 15:49.920:  Many of us enjoy the aroma of our morning coffee.
15:50.600 - 15:53.820:  So do you wake up to the smell of coffee in a building made of coffee?
15:54.320 - 15:56.060:  The answer is sadly not.
15:56.060 - 16:00.740:  You won't get the similar coffee smell because it destroys once you
16:01.240 - 16:04.760:  thermally decompose the material so that all the smell and everything goes away.
16:04.760 - 16:08.340:  So it's same material like sand. It doesn't I mean any sort of smell.
16:08.600 - 16:11.820:  Dr. Rajiv Rochand ending that report by Iona Hampson.
16:14.620 - 16:16.860:  And still to come on the global news podcast.
16:16.860 - 16:23.120:  There's very few articles. We've tried the research and so far we've pulled up nothing.
16:23.680 - 16:27.260:  The spotless giraffe that's puzzling zookeepers in Tennessee.
16:35.960 - 16:37.840:  Introducing Carvana Value Tracker
16:38.040 - 16:41.260:  Where you can track your car's value over time and learn what's driving it.
16:41.520 - 16:42.600:  It might make you excited.
16:42.840 - 16:44.840:  Whoa, didn't know my car was value this high.
16:45.020 - 16:46.020:  It might make you nervous.
16:46.240 - 16:47.300:  Uh oh, markets flooded.
16:47.420 - 16:49.560:  My car's value just dipped 2.3%.
16:49.800 - 16:51.040:  It might make you optimistic.
16:51.300 - 16:52.460:  Our low mileage is paying off.
16:52.540 - 16:53.320:  Our values up.
16:53.600 - 16:54.960:  And it might make you realistic.
16:54.960 - 16:57.180:  Hmm, car prices haven't gone up in a couple weeks.
16:57.640 - 16:58.440:  Maybe it's time to sell.
16:58.440 - 17:01.280:  But it will definitely make you an expert on your car's value.

17:09.940 - 17:11.840:  From their battles on the world stage.
17:12.080 - 17:14.540:  I gave everything for that race and I was able to come away
17:14.820 - 17:17.120:  with something that like I've dreamed about since I was a kid.
17:17.120 - 17:19.040:  To their battles behind closed doors.
17:19.040 - 17:22.600:  I had to reach some terrible bottoms in my addiction
17:23.080 - 17:25.140:  and suffer some really terrible consequences
17:25.240 - 17:29.400:  and suffer a lot of loss due to my drinking to get to where I am today.
17:30.580 - 17:32.680:  On the podium is the podcast where Olympians
17:32.700 - 17:35.160:  and Paralympians share their stories.
17:35.160 - 17:37.520:  On the podium from the BBC World Service.
17:37.940 - 17:40.160:  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
17:41.340 - 17:44.060:  The Republican race for the US presidential election
17:44.060 - 17:47.480:  kicks off in earnest later today with the first TV debate
17:47.480 - 17:49.100:  hosted by Fox News.
17:49.800 - 17:52.980:  But Donald Trump, the runaway favourite to become the party's candidate
17:52.980 - 17:55.500:  in 2024, will not be there.
17:55.700 - 17:58.180:  So the focus turns instead to the rest of the field.
17:58.660 - 18:01.520:  Currently led by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis
18:01.580 - 18:06.720:  as well as more wildcard choices like entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.
18:07.060 - 18:09.020:  I take a lot of inspiration from Nelson Mandela.
18:09.280 - 18:12.680:  Nelson Mandela was a guy who brought together a nation
18:12.680 - 18:16.200:  who was far more divided than ours is today.
18:16.560 - 18:17.980:  The FBI is a failed institution.
18:18.460 - 18:21.820:  Chop it off, shut down the FBI, so move them to the US marshals,
18:21.820 - 18:24.640:  the financial crimes enforcement network at the US treasury
18:24.640 - 18:27.340:  to the secret service which handles some financial crime as well
18:27.860 - 18:28.760:  and then to the DEA.
18:28.980 - 18:31.400:  My basic view in this campaign is we can handle the truth.
18:31.880 - 18:33.200:  COVID-19, what was the origin?
18:33.700 - 18:35.980:  What did we know about the vaccines before we mandated them?
18:36.300 - 18:37.940:  What did we know about Hunter Biden's dealings
18:37.940 - 18:40.240:  before we systematically suppressed that story?
18:40.580 - 18:43.240:  What do we know about the truth of what happened on January 6th?
18:43.440 - 18:47.120:  What I think we need to do is end the Ukraine war on peaceful terms that,
18:47.120 - 18:50.080:  yes, do make some major concessions to Russia,
18:50.640 - 18:52.580:  including freezing the current lines of control.
18:53.040 - 18:54.600:  I've said that I would pardon Donald Trump.
18:54.600 - 18:57.280:  If I'm elected president, I want to win this election
18:57.280 - 18:58.980:  by convincing the voters of this country
18:59.460 - 19:01.880:  that I'm best positioned to take the America first agenda forward,
19:02.260 - 19:06.120:  not by having the federal administrative state eliminate my competition.
19:06.420 - 19:07.500:  Vivek Ramaswamy.
19:07.700 - 19:11.700:  So will Republican voters still be engaged in this TV debate
19:11.700 - 19:13.280:  despite Mr. Trump's absence?
19:13.280 - 19:16.780:  Our North America correspondent Nettao Fik is in Milwaukee
19:16.780 - 19:19.640:  in the state of Wisconsin, where the event is being staged.
19:19.960 - 19:23.400:  They are expecting millions to be watching this first debate,
19:23.400 - 19:26.400:  and quite frankly, it will be the largest audience
19:26.400 - 19:29.960:  most of this party's presidential field has ever had
19:29.960 - 19:32.900:  and will have in these months leading up
19:32.900 - 19:35.600:  to the first caucus in Iowa in January,
19:35.600 - 19:38.280:  and then the other primaries that follow.
19:38.460 - 19:40.940:  So this could be a crucial moment
19:40.940 - 19:45.080:  for all of the other than Trump candidates here.
19:45.720 - 19:47.320:  Nevertheless, as you mentioned,
19:47.760 - 19:50.740:  a lot of the oxygen is already being sucked out of the room
19:50.740 - 19:54.180:  because of the fact that not only is Donald Trump
19:54.220 - 19:56.420:  going to voluntarily surrender,
19:57.280 - 19:58.600:  expectedly in Georgia tomorrow,
19:59.340 - 20:02.880:  for charges that he tried to subvert the election results.
20:02.880 - 20:05.900:  He's also planning to do his own interview
20:05.900 - 20:08.920:  with the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
20:09.600 - 20:12.840:  So what you're having right now is a lot of pundits debating
20:12.840 - 20:15.020:  if this is a good or bad thing for the candidates
20:15.020 - 20:17.240:  in the sense that without Trump there in the room,
20:17.680 - 20:19.520:  they'll have a bit more time to speak
20:19.520 - 20:21.940:  about the policies and issues they want to talk about
20:21.940 - 20:23.960:  without having to compete for time with him.
20:24.520 - 20:28.340:  But also, other saying, because he is the front runner
20:28.340 - 20:30.600:  and not there, it really robs them
20:30.600 - 20:33.980:  of those viral moments where they're taking on the front runner
20:34.220 - 20:36.780:  and it makes it a bit harder for them to try to stand out.
20:37.080 - 20:38.400:  Yeah, I mean, who should we look out for?
20:39.280 - 20:40.440:  Well, I think what we're going to see
20:40.440 - 20:42.260:  is a lot of the candidates gunning
20:42.260 - 20:44.820:  for the Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis.
20:45.340 - 20:48.020:  While Donald Trump right now is still well ahead
20:48.020 - 20:50.540:  in national and state polls above all his others.
20:50.620 - 20:52.640:  I mean, he's consistently been over 50 percent
20:52.640 - 20:54.980:  in national polling averages since the beginning of this year.
20:55.540 - 20:58.700:  And Ron DeSantis has seen his star kind of fall.
20:59.100 - 21:00.960:  So I think we'll see a lot of people competing
21:01.920 - 21:03.640:  to try to knock him from that throne.
21:04.660 - 21:06.800:  Vivek Ramaswamy, as you mentioned there,
21:06.800 - 21:08.900:  he is a political novice.
21:08.900 - 21:13.100:  He is a biotech entrepreneur who really speaks
21:13.100 - 21:15.640:  very fondly of Donald Trump in many ways
21:15.640 - 21:18.260:  and has gone after the woke agenda
21:18.500 - 21:19.640:  at this kind of cultural war
21:19.640 - 21:20.980:  that we're seeing here in the United States.
21:20.980 - 21:22.060:  It'll be interesting to see
21:22.500 - 21:24.360:  if he shines above the field.
21:24.780 - 21:25.700:  But it's interesting, you know,
21:25.700 - 21:27.340:  we have a former vice president,
21:27.340 - 21:28.880:  you know, in Mike Pence,
21:29.400 - 21:30.260:  a former governor's,
21:30.340 - 21:31.200:  current governors,
21:31.700 - 21:33.000:  a former UN ambassador,
21:33.000 - 21:33.860:  Nikki Haley,
21:34.320 - 21:35.740:  a current Senator Tim Scott.
21:36.080 - 21:37.080:  It is a wide field.
21:37.080 - 21:38.160:  So this is the moment
21:38.160 - 21:39.780:  where one of them could really stand out.
21:40.100 - 21:41.780:  Netta Taufik in Milwaukee.
21:42.940 - 21:43.820:  In the 18 months,
21:43.820 - 21:47.280:  since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
21:47.340 - 21:51.980:  as many as 120,000 Russian soldiers have been killed,
21:51.980 - 21:54.680:  according to a recent estimate from US officials,
21:55.400 - 21:57.540:  the Kremlin has been replenishing its forces
21:57.540 - 21:59.560:  with convicts released from Russia's
21:59.560 - 22:01.340:  notoriously brutal prisons.
22:02.260 - 22:04.260:  But many have now returned home
22:04.260 - 22:06.220:  after completing their tours of duty
22:06.720 - 22:08.460:  and gone on to commit terrible crimes.
22:08.460 - 22:11.200:  From Moscow, Wilvernan has this report.
22:12.740 - 22:17.780:  A recruitment video for the Russian military.
22:20.260 - 22:22.640:  Urging ordinary men to sign up
22:23.200 - 22:24.480:  and join your own people.
22:27.080 - 22:29.540:  The Kremlin needs more men for its war.
22:30.360 - 22:32.620:  But thousands of Russians fighting in Ukraine
22:32.720 - 22:35.140:  are convicts recruited from prisons.
22:36.340 - 22:37.700:  Some serve just a few months
22:37.700 - 22:40.020:  before going back to Russia as free men.
22:41.060 - 22:41.880:  In recent months,
22:42.380 - 22:45.320:  a number of horrific crimes have been reported in Russia,
22:45.780 - 22:47.300:  linked to the ex-prisoners.
22:50.000 - 22:52.360:  We've come to St. Petersburg, Russia's second city,
22:52.740 - 22:54.540:  and it's a glorious summer's day here.
22:55.040 - 22:58.260:  But the story we've come to hear is dark and disturbing.
22:59.300 - 23:01.040:  We've come here to meet a lady called Anna,
23:01.800 - 23:03.540:  and she's going to tell us about her grandmother
23:03.540 - 23:06.320:  who was brutally murdered in March this year.
23:07.160 - 23:08.320:  It's actually pretty incredible
23:08.320 - 23:10.260:  that Anna has agreed to meet us at all.
23:10.540 - 23:12.260:  It is very difficult to find anyone
23:12.260 - 23:15.020:  willing to tell us their story openly anymore.
23:15.320 - 23:16.700:  People are afraid to speak out
23:16.700 - 23:18.880:  because they fear reprisals from the authorities
23:19.420 - 23:21.420:  or from radicals from the Wagner group.
23:22.080 - 23:25.440:  She was 85 years old,
23:26.340 - 23:29.360:  and she lived in a wooden house.
23:29.620 - 23:32.560:  Anna's grandmother, Julia, was at home in her village
23:32.960 - 23:34.820:  when a local man came knocking at the door.
23:35.580 - 23:36.300:  She knew him,
23:37.060 - 23:39.760:  he let him enter to his house,
23:40.100 - 23:45.420:  and he killed her with a knife at her own home.
23:46.640 - 23:47.780:  I don't know why.
23:48.500 - 23:50.760:  Julia's killer was a convicted murderer
23:51.260 - 23:53.440:  who had fought with the Wagner group in Ukraine.
23:54.200 - 23:55.180:  He's now in custody.
23:55.980 - 23:59.800:  It's obvious that if they were in prison,
24:00.440 - 24:04.360:  they may have problems with the self-control.
24:05.480 - 24:07.100:  The Wagner group is dangerous.
24:08.180 - 24:10.760:  It's really dangerous for us.
24:11.200 - 24:14.280:  Wagner is no longer fighting on the front line in Ukraine
24:14.440 - 24:16.620:  after the mutiny earlier this year,
24:17.460 - 24:20.280:  but the Russian military is still recruiting from prisons.
24:21.200 - 24:24.800:  First of all, the number of criminal cases will increase.
24:25.420 - 24:28.160:  Yuri Barovskyk is head of the organization,
24:28.680 - 24:29.680:  Russia behind bars.
24:30.460 - 24:32.520:  This men are traumatized at least twice.
24:33.080 - 24:35.580:  They're traumatized because of the Russian prison,
24:35.580 - 24:39.300:  and they are traumatized because of the war in Ukraine.
24:40.040 - 24:40.900:  And when they go back,
24:41.300 - 24:43.580:  they're not able to return to normal life.
24:43.580 - 24:45.580:  They don't know what normal life is,
24:46.240 - 24:50.520:  and the only way for them is to commit a new crime.
24:55.640 - 24:58.820:  This is an exhibition dedicated to what they're calling the heroes
24:58.820 - 25:01.100:  of the special military operation,
25:01.740 - 25:04.000:  and there are letter Zs and Vs.
25:04.640 - 25:07.620:  The symbols of Russia's war in Ukraine.
25:07.620 - 25:13.320:  What's interesting is that a lot of the Russian soldiers portrayed here
25:13.760 - 25:16.760:  are being compared directly to Soviet soldiers
25:17.160 - 25:18.640:  who fought in the Second World War.
25:19.700 - 25:23.700:  The Kremlin says all those fighting in Ukraine are heroes.
25:24.480 - 25:26.120:  A new law has been passed here,
25:26.580 - 25:30.220:  and it's now illegal to insult or discredit anyone
25:30.220 - 25:33.180:  fighting for Russia in Ukraine, including prisoners.
25:33.820 - 25:35.500:  Some are now worried it will be harder
25:35.500 - 25:38.360:  to stop dangerous convicts returning to Russia
25:38.900 - 25:39.980:  and committing more crime.
25:41.860 - 25:43.740:  And more criminals are coming back,
25:44.140 - 25:46.000:  bringing terror to local communities.
25:51.060 - 25:53.780:  Vladimir is the uncle of Vera Pechtileva,
25:54.300 - 25:58.420:  who was murdered three years ago in the city of Kamerova in Siberia.
25:59.040 - 26:03.120:  Vera's ex-boyfriend was given 17 years in prison for her killing,
26:03.700 - 26:06.200:  but he too was released to fight in Ukraine.
26:09.100 - 26:12.260:  Vera's mother is afraid that he'll come back.
26:13.420 - 26:16.320:  He killed her daughter with extreme brutality.
26:17.780 - 26:19.020:  I have no words.
26:20.580 - 26:23.940:  We are the victims and we thought justice would prevail,
26:25.140 - 26:26.560:  but there is no justice.
26:28.140 - 26:35.980:  Back in St. Petersburg, I asked Anna whether she feels safe living in Russia.
26:36.720 - 26:37.980:  No one feels safe.
26:38.920 - 26:40.620:  You feel just powerless.
26:41.520 - 26:46.600:  That's why I speak, because it's a tragedy for our family,
26:47.120 - 26:49.440:  but it could be a lesson.
26:50.580 - 26:51.640:  Maybe it could help.
26:52.680 - 26:55.020:  That report from Moscow by Will Vernon.
26:56.140 - 27:00.920:  South Korea has held its first nationwide air raid drill in six years
27:01.440 - 27:04.980:  to try to improve the nation's response to any attack by North Korea,
27:05.620 - 27:09.720:  but many people in the South decided not to follow the instructions to seek shelter.
27:10.160 - 27:13.060:  Jean McKenzie in the South Korean capital soul has the details.
27:18.940 - 27:23.080:  As the air raids are ensounded, police jumped into the street to stop traffic,
27:23.080 - 27:27.300:  while public officials tried to usher people down into nearby subway stations
27:27.840 - 27:29.060:  to wait for 20 minutes.
27:29.760 - 27:33.460:  At the station we visited only a dozen people gathered to seek shelter.
27:34.160 - 27:40.160:  This happening is necessary to us because we are nervous of North Korea,
27:40.520 - 27:43.660:  so general citizens can remind this.
27:43.800 - 27:46.820:  You think this is a good reminder for what you should do?
27:47.480 - 27:47.620:  Yeah.
27:48.280 - 27:51.160:  But many others continued with their journeys as usual.
27:51.400 - 27:54.780:  Why did you not go and find a shelter when you heard the air raid firing?
27:55.280 - 27:58.980:  I don't know where the shelter is, so I didn't go.
27:59.700 - 28:02.680:  I don't think the war is going to be happened really,
28:02.680 - 28:05.220:  so I don't think it's really important.
28:06.160 - 28:09.620:  This drill used to be held annually, but have been paused for six years.
28:09.940 - 28:15.100:  This was a chance to remind people what to do in the unlikely event of a North Korean attack.
28:15.840 - 28:18.260:  As the North builds up its arsenal of nuclear weapons,
28:18.260 - 28:21.120:  it poses an ever greater risk to the South.
28:21.660 - 28:26.820:  But people here who've lived with the threat for decades are increasingly immune to the danger.
28:27.840 - 28:30.120:  Our South Korean correspondent Jean McKenzie.
28:31.160 - 28:35.700:  A zoo in Tennessee is gaining a lot of interest thanks to its youngest resident,
28:36.220 - 28:40.720:  a baby giraffe born with no distinct spots, just an all-brown coat.
28:41.400 - 28:45.720:  Experts say this is incredibly rare and they are somewhat in the dark about the reason for the
28:45.720 - 28:50.560:  different coloring. The giraffe was born at Bright's zoo at the end of July,
28:50.560 - 28:55.600:  but keepers have only just released pictures because they want the public's help to name her.
28:56.000 - 28:59.360:  The zoo's director David Martin has been talking to Tim Franks.
28:59.640 - 29:03.360:  A lot of zoo professionals are around the country or at where they won.
29:04.000 - 29:08.640:  We started making phone calls right away and just to find out who's seen this.
29:09.740 - 29:11.320:  And nobody has seen it before.
29:11.600 - 29:14.460:  Yeah, I mean it is incredibly rare, isn't it?
29:14.760 - 29:19.980:  Am I right in saying that the last time a giraffe like this, just one solid color was
29:20.620 - 29:24.280:  born at a zoo, it was about 50 years ago?
29:24.740 - 29:27.000:  Yeah, 1972 Tokyo, Japan.
29:27.520 - 29:31.500:  And what do we know about that giraffe? I mean, has science been done on
29:32.060 - 29:35.780:  how this process happens, how this happy accident occurs?
29:36.780 - 29:42.400:  No, there's very few articles. We've tried to research. We've actually reached out to
29:43.440 - 29:49.260:  some beds in that area to see if there's any studies, and so far we've pulled up nothing.
29:49.840 - 29:54.920:  You're, I mean, is your best guess that I mean she you're saying she's very healthy at the moment,
29:54.920 - 29:59.580:  that there should not be any ill effects from just being a single color?
30:00.140 - 30:04.980:  Oh, no, no, no. And actually we do the same thing with all draft babies here at the zoo.
30:05.460 - 30:08.380:  24 hours, we draw blood, send them to our beds.
30:08.380 - 30:14.540:  We do the same thing at 48 hours, and we have a record of every baby born here with our blood
30:14.540 - 30:21.180:  work showed, and her blood work is identical to theirs. So, you know, we knew, we knew right away,
30:22.080 - 30:27.600:  things were good. And I mean, she must stand out in the enclosure. I just wonder if you've got a
30:27.600 - 30:36.060:  sense of how she has been accepted by the by the other giraffes. They accepted her and
30:36.060 - 30:41.440:  that lead immediately. As soon as she came outside the very first time, you know, all of our draft
30:41.440 - 30:47.780:  liked to meet the new babies. And when a new baby comes out, every single draft here is going to
30:47.780 - 30:52.740:  come up, lick on that baby, smell it, and they weren't no different with her. I mean, it was
30:52.840 - 30:58.500:  immediate as soon as she stepped outside. I know that you've got a little competition to
30:58.500 - 31:04.800:  choose a name for the giraffe. Can you remind us of what the what the choices are for the public?
31:05.540 - 31:11.880:  So the first name is Camille, and then we have Fenyali, Shakiri, and Jamilla.
31:12.360 - 31:13.760:  Two Keeper David Martin.
31:16.640 - 31:20.640:  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
31:20.640 - 31:26.260:  This edition was mixed by Vladimir Mzeczka, and produced by Shantel Hartle, our editors, Karen Martin.
31:26.540 - 31:28.980:  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
