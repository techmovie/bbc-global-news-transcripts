00:11.680 - 00:17.740:  by advertising. I was working in a coffee shop in Boston to help pay rent while I was training
00:17.740 - 00:21.440:  for the trials and so people kept joking. They were like, oh yeah, she just took a two-hour coffee
00:21.440 - 00:27.420:  break and went and ran the Olympic trials bare at that. On the podium is back with more Olympians
00:27.420 - 00:32.820:  and Paralympians sharing their journeys to the top. On the podium from the BBC World Service,

00:39.380 - 00:46.220:  BBC World Service. Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of
00:46.220 - 00:51.600:  Thursday the 17th of August. The prosecutor and the US State of Georgia says Donald Trump's
00:51.600 - 00:56.360:  trial on election interference should begin in March, right in the middle of the Republican
00:56.360 - 01:02.020:  primary season. Pakistan deploys troops in Punjab province to control Muslim crowds who attack
01:02.020 - 01:07.100:  Christian homes and churches. And more than 60 migrants up as you're dead after their vessel
01:07.100 - 01:15.060:  sank near Cape Verde off the west coast of Africa. Also in the podcast, the British Museum
01:15.060 - 01:20.840:  sacks a member of staff after items from its collection disappeared. And the Netherlands radical
01:20.840 - 01:26.780:  plan to put an end to this in schools. Teachers end up having big fights with its students
01:26.780 - 01:31.500:  asking them to hand in their phones and the kids will say, no, it's my property. You can just
01:31.500 - 01:41.780:  take it from me. Donald Trump has a busy few months ahead of him. Not only is he campaigning for
01:41.780 - 01:48.140:  the US presidential election next year, he is also facing four separate trials. The latest charges
01:48.140 - 01:52.600:  were brought against him this week in the state of Georgia, following the infamous phone call
01:52.600 - 01:59.780:  when he asked an official to quote, find 11,780 votes so he could beat Joe Biden.
02:00.040 - 02:05.280:  The district attorney has proposed a trial should start in early March, right in the middle of
02:05.280 - 02:10.940:  the Republican primary election season. Before his first appearance in court, June next month,
02:10.940 - 02:16.180:  the former president must be booked in at the Fulton County Jail, which is already under heavy
02:16.180 - 02:20.320:  police guard. Here's what people in the area thought about Mr. Trump being charged.
02:20.820 - 02:25.020:  I don't want to see that happen to nobody. I don't want nobody to go down. The special
02:25.360 - 02:28.940:  the leader of the free world, but right is right and what? Wrong is wrong.
02:29.420 - 02:33.680:  Well, no, it shouldn't be like that. Just look how they don't like it. No, he had to do some
02:34.140 - 02:38.440:  wrong and all to go. They don't pin that on me because you don't like it. Send them to jail.
02:38.440 - 02:44.000:  That those sounds a good thing. I think as well deserve. He's done a lot of stuff in the background
02:44.000 - 02:49.800:  and underhanded stuff. It's time for him to pay for his whatever he done with more details of
02:49.800 - 02:54.960:  the legal process. Here's where a Davis in Washington. Donald Trump and the other 18 defendants
02:54.960 - 03:00.460:  accused of seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election have already been told to surrender
03:00.460 - 03:06.060:  or present themselves at Georgia's Fulton County Jail before Friday the 25th of August.
03:06.060 - 03:11.900:  When it's reported, they may have mug shots taken and be fingerprinted. The district attorney
03:11.900 - 03:17.400:  or prosecutor bringing the case against the former president has now asked the court that Mr. Trump
03:17.400 - 03:22.300:  should also be arraigned, have the charges against him formally presented in the first four
03:22.300 - 03:27.860:  week of September. The prosecutor, Fanny Willis, who Mr. Trump has accused of leading a politically
03:27.860 - 03:33.580:  motivated witch hunt against him also requested the court to approve a provisional trial date of
03:33.580 - 03:39.120:  March the 4th. Mr. Trump has said he will present his own investigation next week, which he says
03:39.120 - 03:44.060:  will completely exonerate him of allegations of racketeering and election meddling.
03:44.060 - 03:49.580:  The setting of a trial date in Georgia, which still has to be agreed by a judge, is important,
03:49.580 - 03:55.840:  given the many other criminal and civil cases being faced by Mr. Trump and his intention to stand
03:55.880 - 04:02.120:  as the Republican candidate in next year's presidential election. We're a Davis in Washington.
04:03.100 - 04:08.380:  Next to an update on a story we reported on in the last edition of the Global News Podcast
04:08.380 - 04:14.440:  from Pakistan, where hundreds of Muslim men have gone on the rampage in a town near Faisalabad.
04:15.060 - 04:19.180:  It came after two Christians were accused of desecrating pages of a Quran.
04:26.660 - 04:33.120:  Well accusations of blasphemy like that are dealt with extremely harshly in Pakistan. Punishments
04:33.120 - 04:38.080:  include the death penalty. Although there is no record of anyone actually being put to death by
04:38.080 - 04:44.220:  the authorities, dozens of alleged blasphemy suspects have been killed by lynch mobs and vigilantes.
04:45.020 - 04:49.200:  In this latest instance, government officials say troops were called in after the crowds
04:49.200 - 04:55.700:  torched Christian churches and houses. The protesters had been encouraged by local Muslim leaders
04:56.240 - 05:01.740:  from Islamabad, his Caroline Davis. Pakistan's social media is full of videos showing a cross
05:01.740 - 05:06.380:  being torn down from the roof of a church in Jaran Waller before the building is set a light.
05:07.020 - 05:11.920:  Others show angry protesters surging through the narrow streets of the city's Christian areas,
05:11.920 - 05:19.140:  chanting slogans while burning furniture taken from nearby homes. One Minister said over 7,000
05:19.140 - 05:24.160:  angry protesters came out on the streets of Jaran Waller after they heard about an alleged
05:24.160 - 05:29.100:  incident of the desecration of the Quran. Police told the BBC that they had registered a case
05:29.100 - 05:34.300:  under the blasphemy law against two Christian brothers who were accused of tearing pages
05:34.380 - 05:40.460:  out of the Quran early this morning. Caroline Davis will write scrupes say blasphemy allegations in
05:40.460 - 05:47.900:  Pakistan can be misused to target religious minorities or to settle scores. Umar Nangiana from the
05:47.900 - 05:53.200:  BBC Urdu service told me more about the relations between Muslims and Christians in the affected
05:53.200 - 05:58.080:  area. Normally it's very courty love and there's never been a problem. The minority Christian
05:58.080 - 06:02.880:  community has been living there for a very long time, maybe over a hundred years at their
06:02.880 - 06:08.300:  in Jaran Waller. There's never been any serious trouble other than the blasphemy accusations
06:08.500 - 06:14.220:  and allegations that we see occasionally in different areas of Pakistan. There's been trouble
06:14.220 - 06:19.920:  in some parts of Faisalabad district which is the same district where Jaran Waller also lies,
06:20.360 - 06:25.040:  but not specifically in this town and people have been living very courtly there. The
06:25.040 - 06:30.580:  relations have been really good, but whenever you know there is this incident of alleged blasphemy
06:30.580 - 06:35.040:  than there are troubles, there are tensions and that is exactly what is happening right now in
06:35.040 - 06:39.440:  Jaran Waller. People are saying that the situation is very tense. Some of them have left their
06:39.440 - 06:46.180:  houses, they're not returning home because they fear that violence may spill over. Umar Nangiana
06:46.180 - 06:51.240:  from the BBC Urdu service in Islamabad. Well speaking at a news conference in Washington
06:51.240 - 06:57.200:  on Wednesday, Vedant Patel of the U.S. State Department said the reports from Pakistan were
06:57.200 - 07:03.180:  worrying and called for an end to the violence. We are deeply concerned that churches and homes
07:03.180 - 07:11.020:  were targeted in response to reported Qaran desecration in Pakistan. We support peaceful freedom
07:11.020 - 07:15.680:  of expression and the right to freedom of religion and belief for everybody. And as we have
07:15.680 - 07:20.620:  previously said, we are always concerned of incidents of religiously motivated violence and we
07:20.620 - 07:25.900:  urge Pakistani authorities to conduct a full investigation into these allegations and call for
07:25.900 - 07:33.060:  all those involved. U.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel. More than 60 migrants have
07:33.060 - 07:37.800:  thought to have drowned after their boat sank off the coast of Cape Verde in West Africa.
07:38.400 - 07:42.020:  Most of them were from Senegal and Sierra Leone and a Pizarro reports.
07:42.660 - 07:47.920:  The vessel was first spotted on Monday by a Spanish fishing boat 300 kilometers off the island
07:47.920 - 07:54.580:  of Sal in Cape Verde. Local police estimate 100 people were initially on board. Most of them from
07:54.580 - 08:01.620:  Senegal and Sierra Leone. 38 people survived some needed hospital treatment. Cape Verde is not
08:01.620 - 08:07.540:  on any particular migrant route as the archipelago is about 600 kilometers off the West African coast.
08:07.540 - 08:13.720:  It's waters are dangerous with high waves and frequent wind changes. But the treacherous route
08:13.720 - 08:19.900:  does lie on the way to Spain's Canary Islands, a gateway used by migrants trying to reach the European
08:21.020 - 08:26.240:  Anup Pizarro. When the head of Niger's presidential guard seized power three weeks ago,
08:26.240 - 08:32.360:  he said he was acting because of a worsening security situation. Niger, like neighbours Marley and
08:32.360 - 08:37.720:  Bikina Faso, has been struggling to deal with a jihadist insurgency, which has plagued the Sahel
08:37.720 - 08:43.300:  region for more than a decade. Under President Mohamed Basum, violence in Niger had actually been
08:43.300 - 08:48.460:  falling. But since his ousting there have been seven jihadist attacks on the armed forces,
08:48.460 - 08:53.940:  the latest on Wednesday left 17 soldiers dead. A West Africa correspondent,
08:53.940 - 08:58.120:  Chris Iwako, told me what the military authorities are saying about the incident.
08:58.760 - 09:05.080:  They had a military convoy that was on patrol duty. They came under attack. It was
09:05.080 - 09:12.520:  an ambush mounted by some armed groups. And in the attack, 17 soldiers were killed.
09:13.100 - 09:18.520:  20 others were injured. Is it the fact that the sort of instability following the coup
09:18.520 - 09:23.960:  seems to have led to an increase in jihadist attacks? This is what it seems. There are
09:23.960 - 09:30.060:  indications that more troops have been withdrawn from the front line to help secure especially the
09:30.060 - 09:38.020:  capital near me after threats by the Ekoaz Regional Block choosing to intervene militarily
09:38.520 - 09:45.500:  if the junta in Niger failed to restate President Basum. Security analysts actually suggest that
09:45.980 - 09:52.580:  pulling out troops from the front line could affect the fight against insurgency in the Sahel
09:52.580 - 09:59.620:  country, especially at a time that countries like the United States and France have stopped
09:59.620 - 10:06.200:  military cooperation with the junta. Again, it looks like the jihadist groups are taking advantage
10:06.200 - 10:12.460:  of the political crisis. They have succeeded in ambushing soldiers in the last seven attacks
10:12.460 - 10:19.160:  close to about 50 soldiers have so far been killed. Is this increase in attacks on the military
10:19.160 - 10:26.220:  and others? Is that likely to weaken support for the coup? Well, we've seen many people in Niger,
10:26.220 - 10:30.780:  especially in the capital near me coming out in large numbers to demonstrate
10:31.500 - 10:37.420:  sure their solidarity in support of the coup, chanting or expressing anti-West anti-France
10:37.420 - 10:42.520:  sentiment believing that the insurgency could have been cursed by Western countries.
10:43.580 - 10:49.280:  Unfortunately, what is happening now is bound to turn the tide in a way because at a time
10:49.280 - 10:55.040:  President Basum was still in power. He was taken to fight the insurgency and there were
10:55.460 - 11:02.100:  reduction in activities of these armed groups. Now it's getting to escalate. If it continues,
11:02.460 - 11:08.740:  a lot of people begin to think differently and feel that perhaps the junta is not really able
11:08.740 - 11:14.960:  to contend the insurgents if they continue in power. Chris, it will occur there in Nigeria monitoring
11:14.960 - 11:20.200:  events in neighboring Niger. The leaders of a wildlife trafficking gang have been convicted
11:20.200 - 11:25.600:  after a four-year investigation. At their trial in Nigeria last month, they pleaded guilty to
11:25.600 - 11:31.400:  smuggling the scales of African pangolins, which conservationists say are being hunted to
11:31.400 - 11:36.800:  extinction. Described as top of the pyramid traffickers, they were responsible for half of
11:36.800 - 11:42.460:  all illegal trade in pangolin scales. The BBC's Steve Swan talked to one of the people who went
11:42.460 - 11:50.320:  undercover to bring down the network. A wildlife trafficker from Vietnam is in Africa to buy
11:50.320 - 11:56.760:  pangolin scales. He's on the phone to a supplier. We changed his voice because he's really an
12:05.540 - 12:08.600:  undercover investigator. The investigator speaks to the gang leader.
12:13.820 - 12:20.380:  They don't realise their calls and movements are being monitored. A huge intelligence operation
12:20.440 - 12:26.200:  run from the secret HQ of a charity in the Netherlands meant within days of the calls
12:26.220 - 12:32.860:  the traffickers were arrested. Now they've pleaded guilty in Nigeria to smuggling pangolin scales.
12:33.380 - 12:38.640:  I can't underestimate the value of this trial to wildlife in Africa. These guys are at the top
12:38.640 - 12:44.560:  of the pyramid. Steve Carmerdy is an ex-police officer who works for the Wildlife Justice Commission.
12:44.560 - 12:50.160:  So we have Drini, Pixie, Jafar and a record eight tons of pangolin scales and more than
12:50.160 - 12:54.340:  1000 elephant tusks have been seized from a shipping container in Hong Kong.
12:54.620 - 13:00.500:  The investigation began in 2018 after seizures of animal parts hidden in shipping containers
13:00.500 - 13:08.180:  on route from Africa to Asia. Inside were scales stripped from the carcasses of thousands of pangolins.
13:08.620 - 13:12.580:  They're a solitary animal. Their defense mechanism is to roll up in a ball. They can't defend
13:12.580 - 13:16.920:  themselves from us and we're decimating them and these guys are profiting from that and there's
13:16.920 - 13:21.260:  no empathy at all. Pangolins are believed to be the most traffic mammal in the world.
13:21.840 - 13:26.300:  They're meets eaten in Africa. Their scales used in traditional medicine in China.
13:27.040 - 13:31.440:  It's estimated a million have been killed by traffickers in the last decade.
13:32.100 - 13:37.740:  That changed during the COVID pandemic. Shipments slowed down so West African traffickers
13:37.740 - 13:44.420:  took to social media to find new buyers. I'm looking at one of the posts now. I can see video of
13:44.420 - 13:50.180:  sacks of pangolin scales piled up in a container and offered for sale. This was intelligence
13:50.180 - 13:57.720:  used by investigators. Van, not a real name, is a young Vietnamese woman who went under cover.
13:58.180 - 14:03.560:  I love animals and why live is my passion? The animals mean nothing to them.
14:04.280 - 14:09.840:  Here's another WhatsApp video. It's mute but you can see Van talking to a trafficker over the phone.
14:09.840 - 14:16.300:  His code name is Genie and he's wandering around his compound with about a dozen sacks of scales
14:16.300 - 14:23.120:  all stacked up off the ground. He didn't realize it but he left vital clues which the team passed on
14:23.120 - 14:28.180:  to the Nigerian authorities. And within 12 hours that rated the premises, arrested his brother
14:28.180 - 14:34.900:  and two other people seized the 7.1 tons of pangolin scales and 800 kilos of ivory because Genie
14:34.900 - 14:41.320:  gave his address and did a video call showing us the products. It's like Pablo Escobar telling
14:41.320 - 14:46.160:  you where he lives in Colombia and showing the cocaine in his basement. Genie wasn't arrested
14:46.160 - 14:52.320:  and is now on the run. But after years of feeling untouchable, he and other wildlife traffickers
14:52.320 - 14:59.820:  are finally feeling the pressure. Steve Swan reporting. Nestled between Colombia and Peru,
14:59.820 - 15:06.220:  two of the world's largest producers of cocaine, Ecuador was until recently known as an island of
15:06.220 - 15:12.440:  peace in South America. But a recent upsurge in violence exploded into full view last week.
15:21.300 - 15:27.200:  The shocking murder of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, an investigative journalist who
15:27.200 - 15:32.680:  often spoke about a link between government officials and organised crime. He'd received numerous
15:32.680 - 15:38.600:  threats and wasn't wearing a bulletproof vest at the time. Poles had suggested that he had a good
15:38.600 - 15:43.520:  chance of getting through to the second round in the election on Sunday. His running mate,
15:43.520 - 15:49.440:  environmental campaigner Andrea Gonzales, spoke to the BBC's James Menendez about the killing.
15:49.960 - 15:56.200:  We found each other in this fight for freedom that we have for more than 15 years here in Ecuador.
15:56.820 - 16:02.340:  Fernando and I shared a vision of this country of peace. This is a paradise that they've turned into hell.
16:02.520 - 16:08.380:  Which I guess means it's been incredibly difficult dealing with what happened and the aftermath.
16:08.840 - 16:13.540:  Yes, Fernando was my friend. I understand that I wouldn't wish any other of the
16:13.540 - 16:19.380:  mates of the presidential candidates to go through what I'm going. But I've lost a friend.
16:19.380 - 16:25.000:  And to me, it's incredibly personal and hard to not be able to say goodbye to my friend because
16:25.000 - 16:31.160:  I'm wearing a bulletproof vest 24 hours. I think no one in Latin America should allow this
16:31.320 - 16:36.000:  in their country to happen. And it's personally a big big loss. I feel a lot of weight on my
16:36.000 - 16:41.360:  shoulders because he always told me that I was supposed to go on with this. So it's a legacy.
16:41.360 - 16:47.560:  I'm not willing to let die with him. He was very outspoken and particularly about the issue of
16:47.560 - 16:54.880:  drugs, gangs and violence. But were you shocked when he was shot? Did you expect that it would come
16:54.880 - 17:00.940:  to that? No, I never imagined that it would happen in Quito in the capital of the country.
17:00.940 - 17:07.120:  In the mid of Raleigh, we thought that we were in danger. Yes. But we went all through the country
17:07.120 - 17:12.160:  and we were in very dangerous cities. I live in one of the most dangerous cities, which is
17:12.160 - 17:19.440:  YQ. And we had all the precautions. Fernando was not being irresponsible. His message was that we
17:19.440 - 17:24.740:  should all be brave. And you should be brave. Even if you do not have a bulletproof vest,
17:24.740 - 17:29.640:  or if you don't have a lot of power or a lot of money, or if you don't have political influence.
17:29.640 - 17:35.120:  And that's the message that he delivered. He wasn't playing with his life or putting us at risk.
17:35.120 - 17:39.580:  The actual message was we have to all be brave. Because I do believe that the good people
17:39.580 - 17:44.480:  are the majority in this country, but we do not make ourselves present in the moments where this
17:44.480 - 17:49.800:  country needs us to step forward. Do you think though he could have taken more precautions given
17:49.800 - 17:54.260:  the threats against him? Do you think he should have taken more precautions? To be honest,
17:54.260 - 17:59.960:  it wouldn't have been useful. He was shot in the head five times with heavy artillery.
17:59.960 - 18:06.260:  It was 20 people involved in this. This has been a shock not only for the democracy but for the
18:06.260 - 18:12.460:  violence in this country, which has reached to an unimaginable point. He was shot from a long
18:12.460 - 18:17.700:  distant rifle. If it wasn't there in the rally, it would have been the next days. And he was shot
18:17.700 - 18:22.880:  in the head. So the bulletproof vest would have been useless. Yes, it was not supposed to be in that
18:22.880 - 18:28.800:  car. It was supposed to get in a car with all the securities and bulletproof car. But they had
18:28.800 - 18:33.640:  everything is studied and they were following us. The whole campaign. They would have done it anyway.
18:34.360 - 18:37.400:  Andrea González in Ecuador talking to James Menendez.
18:40.500 - 18:42.500:  And still to come on the global news podcast.
18:44.100 - 18:49.840:  God willing, Lebanon will become an oil producing country. So there will be a glimmer of hope
18:49.840 - 18:56.000:  for the Lebanese people. Optimism in Lebanon as an oil rig arrives to begin exploration.
19:03.080 - 19:07.660:  What in the world is the podcast exploring the stories and the issues that you need to know about?
19:07.660 - 19:14.980:  93% of fast fashion workers aren't getting paid a living wage. The former president is accused
19:14.980 - 19:20.000:  of trying to overturn democracy. How do we lead athletes train in and around their
19:20.000 - 19:25.580:  menstrual cycle? Understand more. Feel better with what in the world from the BBC World Service.

19:44.620 - 19:50.700:  Ali has been talking to activists in Zimbabwe trying to make basic hygiene more affordable for women
19:57.840 - 20:03.360:  and girls. Singing and waving their precious gift bugs. These girls in rural Zimbabwe have just
20:03.360 - 20:09.360:  received a couple of boxes each of sanitary pads and they can't stop smiling. For some of them,
20:09.620 - 20:12.640:  these pads are the only ones they'll get all year.
20:19.340 - 20:25.280:  Nokozola Nguyen is a women's rights activist. She's distributing pads to a classroom
20:25.280 - 20:28.600:  pack with teenagers and to those who really need them.
20:45.120 - 20:52.960:  In 2019, Nokozola successfully got the government in South Africa to scrap the 15% sales tax on sanitary
20:52.960 - 20:59.580:  pads. Activists across the continent have launched initiatives to tackle period poverty and
20:59.580 - 21:08.560:  break down the stigma still attached to periods. Ibrahim Fale is from Nigeria. He has made it his
21:08.560 - 21:15.140:  mission to raise awareness among boys about menstrual hygiene. I need to do something before
21:24.560 - 21:30.940:  the world bank says that at least 500 million women and girls lack the access they need
21:30.940 - 21:37.100:  to facilities during their periods. Our Pan-African BBC investigation has found that women
21:37.100 - 21:44.080:  on minimum income are spending between 3 to 13% of their monthly wage on sanitary products alone.
21:44.520 - 21:48.080:  In many cases, girls are having to resort to using newspapers,
21:48.780 - 21:53.100:  cow dung and even transactional sex to get the products that they need.
22:00.520 - 22:04.420:  Back at the school, girls are using affirmations to build their confidence.
22:05.180 - 22:09.640:  But Nokozola says there's still a long way to go for women and girls in Africa.
22:10.220 - 22:15.440:  What's stopping us from fighting against eradicating period poverty? What's stopping us from achieving
22:15.440 - 22:21.100:  gender equality? I mean, it doesn't have to take more than 300 years. So if you work together,
22:21.580 - 22:27.940:  then you'll be able to bring in the needed attention towards eradicating period poverty once and
22:27.940 - 22:35.180:  across the globe. She's now working to get a menstrual health rights bill passed in South African
22:35.820 - 22:39.840:  that would allow menstrual hygiene to be classed as a human rights issue.
22:42.340 - 22:49.260:  Barraport by Jemmo Reilly. Lebanon is in the grip of a deep economic and political crisis,
22:49.740 - 22:54.820:  but on Wednesday came a possible lifeline with the arrival of a drilling rig
22:55.220 - 23:00.880:  operated by a consortium led by the French firm Tutel NRG. It will begin exploring for oil and
23:00.880 - 23:06.400:  gas in Lebanese waters later this month. Here's the Lebanese transport minister Ali Hamir.
23:09.660 - 23:14.220:  For the Lebanese government and the Lebanese people, this is a crucial matter.
23:14.460 - 23:19.500:  God willing, before the end of this year, the results will come back positive,
23:19.780 - 23:25.620:  and Lebanon will become an oil producing country. So there will be a glimmer of hope for the
23:25.620 - 23:32.020:  Lebanese people. The exploration of what is known as block nine has been made possible by a U.S.
23:32.020 - 23:38.420:  broker deal to set up a maritime border between Lebanese and Israeli waters. I heard more from
23:38.420 - 23:44.200:  my Arab affairs editor Sebastian Asha. This was a long process, went through a lot of issues,
23:44.200 - 23:47.460:  as you can imagine, because I mean, Israel and Lebanon are technically at war with each other,
23:47.840 - 23:52.980:  so they couldn't deal with each other directly. The main player, although not politically,
23:52.980 - 23:57.540:  but just in a sense of the control that it has over Lebanon is Hasbulla, which of course is
23:58.180 - 24:03.560:  extraordinarily anti-Israel and has fought wars with Israel, but there may even be one coming along
24:03.560 - 24:08.700:  in the next year or two. So their concerns had to be sort of dealt with, but I think again,
24:08.700 - 24:15.000:  with Lebanon in such a dire economic circumstance, it was felt that this was worth pursuing.
24:15.000 - 24:19.060:  So Hasbulla went along with it. In fact, it's a Hasbulla minister who's been talking about it
24:19.560 - 24:25.940:  today in the government. So the U.S. broke that deal last year. It took a lot of very nifty diplomatic
24:25.940 - 24:33.700:  footwork to do that. Israel will receive royalties from this if it happens, because part of a
24:33.700 - 24:38.900:  field that's going to be explored a little bit of it is in the maritime area, but it's been
24:38.900 - 24:44.200:  demarcators belonging to Israel. And after all, they've been through our people in Lebanon
24:44.200 - 24:52.820:  excited by this. I would think absolutely not, because they are people who have lived through all
24:52.820 - 24:59.440:  sorts of problems. So cynicism is kind of a lifestyle there. So I don't think anybody's jumping
24:59.440 - 25:04.740:  up for joy. And the fact that their ministers are saying this will give them even less of a
25:04.740 - 25:09.480:  sense of confidence. I mean, they have been out on the streets against their government trying
25:09.480 - 25:14.260:  to remove it. Essentially, there isn't a government as such in Lebanon. It's a caretaker government.
25:14.260 - 25:19.160:  There's no president. There's no prime minister, except in acting prime minister. And there's no
25:19.160 - 25:24.960:  governor of the central bank either, after he resigned, essentially in disgrace. But I mean, as you
25:24.960 - 25:31.320:  know, even if they do find gas or oil, the development of that will take years. So the actual
25:31.320 - 25:36.760:  economic benefits of this won't be massive for a long time, although obviously if it is discovered
25:37.060 - 25:41.160:  soon, that will be a boost to the local economy in terms of people coming and working on it.
25:41.160 - 25:44.500:  It will be a new industry. That will be very beneficial to Lebanon.
25:44.980 - 25:50.400:  Our Arab Affairs editor, Sebastian Asher. One of the UK's largest tourist attractions,
25:50.400 - 25:56.100:  the British Museum has sacked a member of staff after treasures disappeared. The items,
25:56.100 - 26:02.140:  described as historically priceless, include gold, jewelry, and semi-precious gemstones.
26:02.220 - 26:07.060:  Police are investigating. Robin Brent reports from the Museum in central London.
26:07.600 - 26:12.060:  Somewhere inside this building, which has been in the heart of London for 270 years, it's a
26:12.060 - 26:17.620:  globally renowned institution, but somewhere inside there is essentially a crime scene tonight.
26:17.620 - 26:22.540:  We heard from the British Museum that there are various items that are either missing, stolen,
26:22.540 - 26:27.940:  or damaged. A member of their staff has been dismissed. So let's look at what we know about what's
26:27.940 - 26:33.020:  missing. These are small pieces that were kept inside a storeroom inside this building. There
26:33.020 - 26:38.200:  weren't being shown to members of the public and they include apparently gold, jewelry, gems of
26:38.200 - 26:43.980:  semi-precious stones and glass. Now they date back to the 15th century BC and some of the items
26:43.980 - 26:48.460:  come all the way up to the 19th century AD. So that means that some of these missing or stolen items
26:48.460 - 26:54.420:  could be as old as three and a half thousand years. Now we've heard from George Osborne,
26:54.420 - 26:58.180:  he's formerly a prominent conservative politician in this country. He's now the chair of the British
26:58.180 - 27:03.200:  Museum and he said the priorities for them are to find the missing goods and to make sure it doesn't
27:03.200 - 27:08.480:  happen again and he's described this as a sad day for all of those who love the British Museum.
27:08.840 - 27:12.840:  But what's clear tonight is not much is clear. They don't have a full inventory of what's
27:12.840 - 27:17.160:  gone missing. They don't know where this stuff is. They don't know how long it's been going on for
27:17.160 - 27:20.900:  and they can't place a value on these meeting items as well. Some of them, as I said,
27:20.900 - 27:26.700:  potentially thousands of years old. Robin Brandt at the British Museum, not far from us here,
27:26.700 - 27:33.780:  in central London. Now to an issue which many a parent has struggled with, how to regulate children's
27:33.780 - 27:39.260:  use of mobile phones. Last month the Dutch government announced that from the start of next year
27:39.260 - 27:44.560:  all phones will be banned from classrooms to stop them disrupting learning. From the Netherlands,
27:44.560 - 27:49.420:  here's Anna Holligan. Students' phones have turned some classrooms into battle grounds.
27:49.420 - 27:55.200:  Teachers end up having big fights with its students asking them to hand in their phones and
27:55.200 - 27:59.820:  the kids will say, no, it's my property. You can just think from me. From January 2024,
27:59.820 - 28:05.160:  all devices from smartphones to tablets to watches will be banned in Dutch schools.
28:05.160 - 28:11.000:  With a few exceptions, for example, during lessons on digital skills or for students with a
28:11.000 - 28:17.020:  medical need or learning disability. Come to the station to meet a friend who is a teacher in
28:17.020 - 28:22.360:  a high school here in the Hague. Her name is Asha. It's a challenge to get the kids off of
28:22.360 - 28:27.220:  their phones. It's a challenge to monitor what they're doing on their phones. Have you ever had any
28:27.220 - 28:32.280:  direct confrontation with a student because they just refuse to put their phones? Yes.
28:33.180 - 28:38.980:  Yes. This student was 18 years old so he could basically do whatever he wants. Anyways,
28:38.980 - 28:46.520:  but he was not learning for his exams and parents are spending a lot of money on his schooling.
28:46.520 - 28:52.800:  So they expect me to take the phone from him. And yes, it was very challenging and eventually the
28:52.800 - 28:57.860:  phone was locked in the locker for the rest of the day. But the result is not what you want because
28:57.860 - 29:04.780:  this boy was so mad at the fact that his phone was locked away, that he was not learning anyways.
29:04.780 - 29:10.900:  It's best to find a balance instead of choose a fight in this situation. I think it will give
29:10.900 - 29:16.740:  calmer learning environments. That's for sure. But I think as soon as the bell rings, the kids will
29:16.740 - 29:21.060:  run to their locker and get their phones out. That's the thing that I am a little bit worried about
29:21.060 - 29:26.240:  is that the full break time will be spent on their phones individually instead of together.
29:26.600 - 29:31.020:  Like many teachers though, Laurie's looking forward to losing the virtual competition.
29:31.520 - 29:37.680:  It's hard enough to get teenagers to focus on their work. If they then have other more interesting
29:37.680 - 29:42.680:  things to look at, it doesn't really work because you can't compete with that really. Do you think
29:42.680 - 29:50.380:  this could have a positive impact on students? I'm hoping that it will give them a lot more time
29:50.380 - 29:56.080:  to focus on what they're doing and I'm also hoping that it'll be easier for them to connect to
29:56.080 - 30:01.040:  each other in the classroom rather than people elsewhere on a screen which is more abstract.
30:01.980 - 30:07.040:  Their schools are still on holiday right now and interestingly all the teenagers in this park
30:07.040 - 30:13.180:  are on their phones. My daughter Zina's been with me listening to these interviews. So what's
30:13.180 - 30:19.460:  this seven-year-old pupil's perspective? I think that it's probably a good idea to ban
30:19.460 - 30:27.840:  phones but smartwatches are okay because smartwatches are smaller and easier to ignore. If there's
30:27.840 - 30:36.620:  an emergency you can check that on your smartwatch. The ban on all smart devices is not legally
30:36.620 - 30:42.420:  enforceable but it may become so in the future. Anna Holligan reporting from the Netherlands.
30:43.400 - 30:47.740:  Finally, have you ever looked at your bank account and wished there was more money in it?
30:48.220 - 30:53.940:  Well a technical glitch in Ireland meant that customers were able to withdraw large sums of cash
30:53.940 - 31:00.180:  often bigger than their balances. Cues inevitably formed at cash points as Charlotte Gallagher reports.
31:01.860 - 31:07.200:  Videos on social media show people lining up next to Bank of Ireland cash machines.
31:07.260 - 31:13.040:  Some are still in their pajamas and dressing gowns having rushed out when they heard you could
31:13.040 - 31:19.380:  withdraw huge sums of money no matter how much you had in your account. One man told the Irish
31:19.380 - 31:24.720:  Times newspaper, I don't know if I'll get away with it but it's worth a shot. The Bank of
31:24.720 - 31:31.080:  Ireland admitted a technical fault and warned customers that any money withdrawn would be taken back.
31:31.820 - 31:37.620:  It said people should not withdraw or transfer funds if they were likely to become overdrawn.
31:38.280 - 31:43.360:  Police were seen guarding some cash machines to deter people from taking advantage of the problem.
31:43.700 - 31:49.620:  The Irish police force, known as the Guard of Shiacona, said officers would remind people of their
31:49.620 - 31:55.600:  personal responsibility in carrying out their banking. Some Bank of Ireland customers were all
31:55.600 - 32:02.000:  so unable to access online banking and the app. The bank says the problem is now fixed and has
32:02.000 - 32:05.300:  apologised for the disruption. Charlotte Gallagher
32:08.320 - 32:12.200:  And that is all from us for now but the Global News podcast will be back very soon.
32:12.200 - 32:16.480:  This edition was mixed by Chesney Forks Porter and produced by Emma Joseph.
32:16.840 - 32:20.480:  Our editors Karen Martin, I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
