01:10.020 - 01:15.620:  I'm Garas Barlow and in the early hours of Tuesday the 29th of August, these are our main stories.
01:16.280 - 01:21.000:  The pressure on the head of Spanish football to resign for kissing a player after the
01:21.000 - 01:26.060:  Women's World Cup final has intensified, with football cheesed from every Spanish region
01:26.060 - 01:32.220:  urging him to quit now. Donald Trump has reacted angrily after a judge set the start date for one
01:32.220 - 01:38.380:  of his trials for March, a day before the super-choose date presidential primaries. And the Nigerian
01:38.380 - 01:43.620:  Air Force says it's carried out air strikes against illegal oil installations in the Niger Delta.
01:46.400 - 01:51.500:  Also in the podcast, the Niska people believe the memorial pool is alive with the spirit of
01:51.500 - 01:56.580:  their ancestors. They say it was stolen from the Nass Valley in British Columbia almost a hundred
01:56.580 - 02:03.120:  years ago. So now the 11 meter high Totem pole is beginning its journey home to Canada from a Scottish
02:07.120 - 02:12.360:  museum. More on that in a few minutes time, but first the Spanish Football Federation's regional
02:12.360 - 02:17.520:  presidents have unanimously called for the immediate resignation of the Federation boss,
02:17.980 - 02:23.420:  Louis Rubialis. In a statement, they said his behavior had seriously damaged Spanish football
02:23.420 - 02:28.240:  when he kissed a player on the lips after the victory in the Women's World Cup. The player,
02:28.240 - 02:34.300:  Jenny Amoso said it was not consensual. Hundreds of people demonstrated on Monday in the centre of
02:34.300 - 02:40.080:  Madrid calling on Mr. Rubialis to go. Speaking to the BBC, a senior member of Parliament from the
02:40.080 - 02:44.860:  governing Socialist Party in Spain, Hannah Jules said that the Spanish people had made their
02:44.860 - 02:50.720:  opinions on the issue clear. The society have judged the president of the Spanish Federation
02:50.720 - 02:56.020:  of Podemos. This country is the feminist country and the types of attitudes are not tolerated
02:56.020 - 03:00.480:  anymore and do not represent the Spanish society. Right now in Madrid, there is a huge
03:00.480 - 03:05.240:  demonstration of thousands of people against him and what it represents, you know, that certain
03:05.240 - 03:11.260:  abuse of power, many football players, very famous political voices, many famous personalities
03:11.260 - 03:16.180:  around the world and in Spain have complained about his behavior. So, yes, I think that there is a
03:16.180 - 03:20.020:  big majority of the society that reject these types of attitudes.
03:20.580 - 03:25.300:  While Spanish prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation looking into whether the act
03:25.300 - 03:30.840:  amounted to sexual assault, all of a conway got the latest from our corresponded imagery. Can I
03:31.640 - 03:37.200:  think this has seen as a victory, certainly for those people who have been calling for Mr.
03:37.200 - 03:43.580:  Rubialis to resign for the last week or so. That includes the Spanish government. It includes
03:43.580 - 03:51.380:  the women's football team who turned against him last week when he claimed that that kiss was
03:51.380 - 03:58.080:  consensual and contradicted Yeni El Moso, who said it wasn't, and many others in Spanish society
03:58.080 - 04:04.440:  who have been calling for him to resign. So, he hasn't resigned yet, but the feeling is that the
04:04.480 - 04:10.880:  fact that his own federation is now calling on him to do so, that's a major development and it
04:10.880 - 04:16.380:  could just be the final nail in the coffin of his leadership of the federation. Yeah, I mean,
04:16.380 - 04:22.200:  it's taken quite a while to get here. At one point, the federation even tried to get itself
04:22.200 - 04:28.900:  booted out of UEFA and protested at the intervention of the Spanish government. It still has some
04:28.900 - 04:34.420:  work to do to rebuild its reputation, doesn't it? Well, yes, it does, and this is all rather
04:34.420 - 04:38.940:  embarrassing for many members of the federation because you go back to Friday of last week, for
04:38.960 - 04:45.480:  example, when Mr. Rubialis appeared before the federation and he said he was not resigning despite
04:45.480 - 04:50.940:  the mounting pressure on him, and he insisted that he had done nothing wrong. He said that that
04:50.940 - 04:56.600:  kiss had been completely consensual, and he gave a very defiant speech and said that he was staying
04:56.600 - 05:01.860:  exactly where he was. Now, when he settled that, a lot of people in that room applauded him,
05:01.940 - 05:06.620:  and what we've seen over the last few days is that many of the people who were applauding him then
05:06.620 - 05:12.400:  have started to change their tune. Some of them have issued communicates saying that they now
05:12.400 - 05:18.880:  actually condemn his behaviour, and that sort of critical mass built over the last few days,
05:18.880 - 05:24.500:  until we actually got to this stage now where the whole federation actually turned against him.
05:24.660 - 05:29.200:  Yeah, interesting to see that turn around under plenty of criticism from around the country,
05:29.200 - 05:34.300:  but the very fact that they did applaud him, what does that say about some in Spanish society?
05:34.600 - 05:39.820:  Well, we heard today from Yolanda Diaz, who is a deputy prime minister, and she addressed that
05:39.820 - 05:45.660:  very issue. Now, she's been someone who's been very vocal on these issues of gender equality
05:45.660 - 05:52.460:  and sexual consent during this legislature, and she said, you know, this was disgraceful behaviour
05:52.460 - 06:00.060:  to see allies of Mr. Rubialis last week, applauding him when, you know, we knew what he had done,
06:00.060 - 06:07.940:  we knew that he had kissed Jenny and Morso, and there was no excuse for anyone to support him,
06:07.940 - 06:13.340:  and yet there they were clapping him. She said that, you know, for people to then turn around
06:13.340 - 06:18.920:  and start saying that they condemned his behaviour didn't seem right, and she said that all of that
06:18.920 - 06:23.000:  kind of behaviour, the behaviour of Mr. Rubialis, and all of those who had supported him was completely
06:23.000 - 06:29.400:  intolerable. And how damaging has this whole affair been for Spanish football? I mean, it's hoping to
06:29.980 - 06:34.120:  host the men's world cup in 2030, along with Portugal and Morocco.
06:34.660 - 06:39.460:  Yes, and I think that's one of the big worries about all of this. I mean, clearly people were
06:39.460 - 06:45.460:  very upset across Spain about this whole affair from the point of view of sexual consent,
06:45.620 - 06:50.340:  and gender equality and so on, but I think a lot of other people were very angry about
06:50.340 - 06:54.820:  that from the point of view of the damage that was doing Spain's reputation internationally,
06:54.860 - 07:02.580:  and specifically, there is that concern about the world cup bid for 2030. I think this was
07:02.580 - 07:08.300:  something that was worrying the federation, members of the federation over the last few days,
07:08.880 - 07:15.140:  especially when they saw FIFA, football's world governing bodies step in and suspend Mr. Rubialis
07:15.580 - 07:18.620:  just a few days ago, and they suspended him provisionally.
07:19.440 - 07:25.400:  I was Guy Hechco in Spain. Donald Trump is currently the midst of preparing for four criminal
07:25.400 - 07:30.100:  court cases charged with everything from racketeering and violation of the Espionage Act
07:30.660 - 07:36.600:  to falsify business records and defrauding the United States. On Monday, we learned that the former
07:36.600 - 07:43.340:  president will go on trial in Washington DC on the 4th of March 2024 to face four federal charges.
07:43.920 - 07:48.620:  These relate to his alleged attempts to derail the transfer of power to the incoming president,
07:48.620 - 07:56.240:  Joe Biden, back in 2020. Team Trump had been pushing for a trial date in 2026, well after the upcoming
07:56.240 - 08:02.340:  election, but the judge confirmed the hearing will be just hours before so-called Super Tuesday,
08:02.740 - 08:07.180:  a potentially decisive date in the Republican presidential nominating contest.
08:08.000 - 08:13.360:  I spoke to our correspondent in Washington, Sean Dilly, and asked him how important the date is
08:13.480 - 08:18.860:  of this trial. It could be significant, and I have to say the other side to that one is they could
08:19.340 - 08:24.340:  just rip it up because what happens in criminal trials is they start arguing and entering motions,
08:24.340 - 08:30.200:  but if it goes ahead as schedules, then as you say the Super Tuesday thing, it is huge, lots of
08:30.200 - 08:36.200:  these huge states, California being among them. They get to vote on who from each party they would
08:36.200 - 08:41.480:  like to be the nominee. Essentially at the end of this, they call it the primaries and the caucuses
08:41.480 - 08:46.960:  where these states get to vote in this way. Between the country, they get to decide which presidential
08:46.960 - 08:51.320:  candidate from the Republican party will face which one, from the Democrats. At the moment,
08:51.320 - 08:56.740:  it's shaping up to look quite as though it will be a Donald Trump Joe Biden face off again,
08:56.800 - 09:04.780:  but it's a time when he should be out campaigning. He's due to be in court instead, but we've seen
09:04.780 - 09:08.400:  in the party, he does tend to use these encounters as political campaigning tools.
09:08.760 - 09:13.900:  Hugely so. We saw millions of dollars raised after that mugshot was taken and spread around the world,
09:13.900 - 09:18.800:  and obviously, Sean, there are three other criminal court cases ongoing against Mr. Trump.
09:18.800 - 09:22.040:  But we expect the one announced for the fourth of March will be the first of these,
09:22.040 - 09:25.820:  and the rest will follow subsequently. You can expect anything you like. You can never know.
09:25.820 - 09:30.560:  I know enough time of doing this job in journalism that things change quite a lot, but it's certainly
09:30.560 - 09:35.300:  the first that we have a date set. We'll run you a little bit through the diary. We'll put to one
09:35.300 - 09:40.800:  side the civil cases. In at the end of March, he's separately due to go on trial in New York,
09:40.800 - 09:45.740:  which is a state case, and he's charged with using his business to hide hush money payments
09:45.760 - 09:53.500:  to a porn star stormy Daniels. Then in May, he's due to stand trial in Florida over a different
09:53.500 - 09:58.140:  that this was a federal case. This is prosecuted by the US government very much as in the case we're
09:58.140 - 10:02.860:  talking about here today in Washington, DC. But this case that's prosecuted in Florida relates to
10:02.860 - 10:09.580:  classified documents that he's alleged to have held onto and charges that he attempted to hide
10:09.580 - 10:15.060:  what he was doing to conceal the retention of those documents. He faces 40 charges in that case.
10:15.240 - 10:19.480:  Then of course, the Georgia case, which everybody will be very aware of because he
10:19.480 - 10:26.580:  booked himself into the Fulton County jail last week. That date for a trial hasn't been set,
10:26.600 - 10:30.640:  but we do know that already he's due to have what's called an arraignment, which is a first hearing
10:30.640 - 10:35.040:  where people will get the opportunity to enter a plea. So that would be happening next week on
10:35.040 - 10:40.320:  the 6th of September. Should he attend? Because in Georgia, unlike other areas, it is possible in
10:40.320 - 10:45.740:  some cases to waive that first appearance. That was Sean Dilly in Washington, and that was the
10:45.740 - 10:50.000:  sound of Sean ripping up the rulebooks. He's both a sound effect artist and a correspondent.
10:50.860 - 10:55.200:  Well, for his part, Donald Trump has said he will appeal. He said the judge's setting of the
10:55.200 - 11:01.120:  March date amounted to election interference. To Nigeria now, where the Air Force says it's
11:01.120 - 11:06.760:  carried out strikes on several illegal oil refining sites in the Niger Delta. It said a boat
11:06.760 - 11:11.500:  full of crude oil was also destroyed. The Nigerian authorities have long struggled to prevent
11:11.500 - 11:17.200:  the theft of oil from pipelines, but aerial bombardments are rare. With more, here's Will Ross.
11:17.780 - 11:22.240:  Nigeria's Air Force says these are illegal oil refineries that have been hit with air strikes.
11:22.700 - 11:26.020:  The obvious environmental consequences of this tactic were not mentioned.
11:26.020 - 11:32.200:  Officials say every day around 400,000 barrels of oil are stolen. That's around a third of
11:32.200 - 11:37.440:  Nigeria's daily production. To try to stop the massive theft, successive governments have turned
11:37.440 - 11:42.120:  to the militants who once blew up the pipelines and kidnapped oil workers in the Niger Delta.
11:42.740 - 11:47.980:  Last year, a company run by a former militant called Tom Polo was given a contract worth tens of
11:47.980 - 11:53.860:  millions of dollars to protect the pipelines. Will Ross. Let's stick in the region because
11:53.860 - 11:59.520:  a month ago, the armed forces in the former French colony of Niger seized power in a military coup.
12:00.100 - 12:05.840:  West Africa's regional block, Echoes condemned the action and demanded an immediate return to
12:05.840 - 12:10.940:  civilian rule so far without success. But Niger's example isn't unique.
12:10.940 - 12:15.380:  Neighboring Bikina Faso and Marley also saw the army seize power in recent years,
12:15.820 - 12:20.260:  justifying their power grab as necessary to tackle the worsening economic and security
12:20.260 - 12:25.220:  situations. But have those promises been realised? Our correspondent, Puyakensipi,
12:25.220 - 12:28.020:  starts a report in the capital of Bikina Faso, Waegaruku.
12:30.960 - 12:37.040:  I was here when I started that day, it was not easy for everybody in the city.
12:37.500 - 12:44.000:  Basil, whose name we have changed to protect his identity, is a 24-year-old student from Waegaruku,
12:44.600 - 12:52.800:  Bikina Faso's capital. There was noise everywhere, gunshots and it was really very scary and
12:52.800 - 12:59.040:  difficult for everybody. He remembers the day the country experienced its second coup of 2022.
12:59.880 - 13:06.500:  The current man in power, Captain Ibrahim Troy, removed the former interim president over his
13:06.500 - 13:13.180:  alleged inability to secure the country. But Basil says that despite promises from this military
13:13.180 - 13:19.440:  government, the security situation has worsened and now he can no longer travel to visit his family
13:19.440 - 13:25.320:  village. I think more than two years I have not been able to go there. The towists have blocked
13:25.320 - 13:32.460:  the roads because you cannot travel without meeting up the towists. Almost 15,000 people have died
13:32.460 - 13:39.440:  in conflict since 2018. But half of these deaths occurred last year once the military took power
13:39.780 - 13:46.160:  and close to 5 million people need humanitarian assistance. And even more people might be in need
13:46.160 - 13:52.240:  soon, as prices of basic items continue to go up, leaving many families struggling to put food on
13:52.240 - 14:07.080:  the table. The things that are really getting more expensive are groceries. Over 800 kilometers away
14:07.080 - 14:13.680:  from Waegaruku, Naba, a musician from Marley's capital Bamako, is singing a patriotic song.
14:14.980 - 14:20.540:  Marley, like Bikina Faso, experienced two military coups in 2020 and 2021.
14:23.540 - 14:29.880:  The situation was getting worse and worse and we needed a glimmer of hope. We needed someone to
14:29.880 - 14:36.060:  really take charge and that was it. And this coup, this coup de temps, did that for us.
14:39.880 - 14:45.140:  Feared by anti-colonial slogans, addressed to French troops, Marley's coup remains popular with
14:45.140 - 14:51.040:  citizens. But despite the rhetoric, the UN has said the country is facing a worsening security
14:51.040 - 14:58.080:  and a dire humanitarian situation. Despite the warnings, Naba believes that, with time, the
14:58.080 - 15:05.320:  military can turn the country around. Marley today sincerely wants to become independent and
15:05.320 - 15:12.040:  autonomous and we are aware that this is not an easy task. Now that Niger has also joined Bikina Faso,
15:12.040 - 15:18.140:  Marley and Guinea on the list of coup-related sanctions, it remains to be seen how these
15:18.140 - 15:22.580:  military governments will face the uphill battle of delivering on their promises.
15:23.780 - 15:29.820:  Reporting there from Priyanka Sippi. Him in the UK, the authorities say they fixed a problem
15:29.820 - 15:34.480:  that caused disruption for flights around the world. The glitch affected the planning system
15:34.480 - 15:40.240:  at the National Air Traffic Control Network or NATS. It caused widespread delays in cancellation.
15:40.820 - 15:45.440:  Some passengers were told that their journeys had been postponed by up to 12 hours. Although
15:45.440 - 15:49.840:  British airspace did remain open, officials limited the number of planes that could either take
15:49.840 - 15:53.900:  off or land. And many airlines have warned it would take time to clear the backlog.
15:54.520 - 15:56.380:  Our correspondent Joenward followed developments.
15:56.380 - 16:02.540:  It's been a day of delay and disruption. Just after midday, the National Air Traffic Service
16:02.540 - 16:08.280:  announced it was suffering from a technical issue. It came as hundreds of reports started to emerge
16:08.280 - 16:15.620:  from passengers stuck at airports across the UK and Europe. One of them was Chris Rowe. He was
16:15.620 - 16:21.260:  supposed to be returning to the UK from Rotterdam with his wife and baby. Our flight was due to take
16:21.260 - 16:27.180:  off about half an hour ago. It just has delayed at a moment, but on the act it's saying to torture
16:27.180 - 16:32.840:  it 2am tomorrow. With a one-year-old, obviously, we've got nappies and weft wipes and things and
16:33.320 - 16:39.160:  foods to worry about. At 220, it emerged the problem was with the automated flight planning system.
16:39.960 - 16:46.060:  Roots were having to be input manually, causing massive delays both in the UK and around Europe.
16:46.060 - 16:51.540:  Michelle Robson, who spent years working at air traffic control and was delayed flying to London
16:51.540 - 16:57.880:  from Jersey, had already been told of the cause. As I understand it from Euro control and speaking
16:57.880 - 17:03.300:  to former colleagues, there was a flight planning system failure this morning which affected
17:03.300 - 17:08.540:  both centres in the UK. It's unusual for it to last this long. There are failures every
17:08.540 - 17:13.440:  couple of years, but normally they only last a couple of hours, so it's quite an extensive
17:13.440 - 17:20.560:  failure if it's affecting both centres in the UK. Just before 3pm, the aviation data firm Sirium
17:20.860 - 17:30.120:  revealed 232 departing and 271 inbound flights had already been cancelled. About 20 minutes after
17:30.120 - 17:35.900:  that, Nats put out a statement saying the problem had been fixed. It apologized for the disruption.
17:36.580 - 17:42.340:  According to John Strickland, an industry expert, that disruption will not end anytime soon.
17:42.700 - 17:46.700:  This is going to ripple on for the rest of the day and indeed into the following days because
17:47.400 - 17:52.680:  aircraft that have been held on the ground with crews face the situation of the ticking
17:52.680 - 17:58.680:  clock in terms of the hours that crews can stay on duty and that then causes a further effect on
17:58.680 - 18:04.200:  not having either planes or crews in the right place or with hours available to operate following
18:04.780 - 18:09.140:  services. Coming on a bank holiday in the middle of summer, there could hardly have been a
18:09.140 - 18:15.160:  worst time for this to happen. Hundreds of thousands of journeys disrupted at huge cost to the
18:15.160 - 18:22.200:  airlines and the passengers who rely on them. The BBC's Joe Inwood. A large totem pole is being
18:22.200 - 18:27.460:  returned to Canada nearly a century after it was sold to the National Museum of Scotland.
18:28.140 - 18:33.180:  Researchers say the pole, which is 11 metres tall, was stolen from the NISCA nation and
18:33.180 - 18:38.180:  indigenous group in British Columbia. Ahead of the poles return, a ceremony was held on the
18:38.180 - 18:50.760:  museum in Edinburgh as Katie Hunter reports. A slow procession through the National Museum of
18:50.760 - 18:57.320:  Scotland, ahead of a private spiritual ceremony. People from the NISCA nation are in Edinburgh to
18:57.320 - 19:03.300:  prepare their totem pole for the journey home. Among them, NISCA chief, Seymog Nishto.
19:03.860 - 19:11.760:  Today was probably one of the most happy days in my life because I am really, really most
19:11.760 - 19:20.860:  in the right now and I could feel my ancestral grandmother. The NISCA people believe the
19:20.860 - 19:26.000:  memorial pole is alive with the spirit of their ancestors. They say it was stolen from the
19:26.000 - 19:32.240:  NIS Valley in British Columbia almost a hundred years ago. Dr. John Giblin is from National Museums
19:32.360 - 19:37.240:  Scotland. I'm really pleased that the pole will be returning to its home where its spiritual,
19:37.240 - 19:42.480:  cultural and historical significance is most keenly felt and I'm really pleased that we've been
19:42.480 - 19:47.560:  able to use our procedure to work with the family to be able to help make this happen. Next month,
19:47.560 - 19:52.460:  the memorial pole will leave the museum in the middle of the night before it's flown back to
19:52.460 - 19:59.100:  British Columbia by the Canadian military. NISCA academic Dr. Amy Parent, also called Nox
19:59.100 - 20:04.220:  Jarrett, says it'll be a special moment. I don't think I can ever be fully prepared for the
20:04.220 - 20:09.440:  motions that you feel on a day that is so historically significant to us, but I can imagine
20:09.800 - 20:14.480:  that I'm going to feel absolutely just joy in my heart and a sense of peace in knowing that we
20:14.480 - 20:19.400:  have our ancestral relative home with us back on our mother lands. The NISCA nations say this
20:19.400 - 20:26.140:  is a historic moment of reconciliation. They hope the world is watching. Katie Hunter reporting from
20:26.140 - 20:34.060:  Scotland. Still to come. There's a slalom track of obstacles, an s-shaped sort of bend and a
20:34.060 - 20:39.860:  series of tight curves, then they got drivers to do those tracks sober. But what did the police in
20:39.860 - 20:44.240:  Japan do next in their efforts to tackle the problems of dream driving?
20:51.640 - 20:55.620:  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
20:55.760 - 21:01.540:  Our podcast Good Bad Billionaire ticks one billionaire at a time and explains exactly how they
21:01.540 - 21:05.960:  made their money. And then we decide if they are actually good, bad or just plain wealthy.
21:06.100 - 21:11.320:  So if you want to know if Rihanna is as much of a bad gal as she claims, or what Jeff Bezos really
21:11.320 - 21:16.960:  did to become the first person in history to pocket $100 billion, listen to Good Bad Billionaire

21:25.920 - 21:32.260:  The road to success seems quick. My first try to go to Edinburgh Games was in 1980.
21:32.260 - 21:35.340:  Everybody's been seeing me run for years growing up.
21:35.480 - 21:40.360:  Get to know the people behind the medals as Olympians and Paralympians share their stories.
21:40.660 - 21:44.260:  My story can help so many other victims and survivors.
21:45.400 - 21:49.100:  On the podium from the BBC World Service. The journey in the ups and downs.

21:55.640 - 22:00.540:  Right now though, it's the Global News podcast and we take you to Afghanistan next where a group
22:00.540 - 22:05.560:  of young female students have been stopped at the airport and turned away while trying to leave
22:05.560 - 22:11.160:  the country to study abroad. Some of the group have been granted scholarships to the University of Dubai
22:11.160 - 22:16.400:  by an Emirati billionaire that was after the Taliban banned women from attending university.
22:17.100 - 22:19.100:  Our correspondent Yelda Hakeem told me more.
22:19.740 - 22:24.760:  These scholarships really provided a window of hope, a window of opportunity when so much
22:24.760 - 22:29.700:  else is bleak across the country. As we've been reporting over the last two years,
22:29.700 - 22:36.160:  it's been almost 700 and seven days now since Afghan girls over the age of 12 can't go to school.
22:36.760 - 22:40.400:  And then in December last year, they were banned from going to university.
22:41.040 - 22:45.060:  That's when the University of Dubai, like so many other universities around the world,
22:45.060 - 22:48.340:  stepped in and said, look, we'll provide these girls with scholarships.
22:48.400 - 22:52.180:  We'll give them the education they're denied in their home country.
22:53.040 - 22:57.280:  They got as far as the airport and then they were banned and blocked from leaving.
22:58.380 - 23:02.820:  We know that some secondary education for girls is going on in secret in Afghanistan.
23:02.820 - 23:06.340:  We also know of this case with these girls being stopped from going to Dubai.
23:07.100 - 23:09.580:  Do we think they're therefore maybe more cases like this?
23:10.580 - 23:17.420:  I think throughout the last two years, we haven't necessarily heard publicly about cases of
23:17.420 - 23:23.080:  women being prevented and turned away, but it has happened. It just so happened that this
23:23.080 - 23:29.480:  particular individual, a billionaire businessman who had provided these scholarships to these young
23:29.480 - 23:35.600:  girls and young women was very vocal on social media and said, I'm not happy these young women
23:35.640 - 23:40.780:  have been blocked and prevented. In fact, three young women who were traveling with a male
23:40.780 - 23:47.160:  chaperone who had made it as far as the aircraft itself were escorted off. He made it very clear he
23:47.160 - 23:52.900:  was unhappy and it's turned into a global story, but we have absolutely those of us who are Afghan
23:52.900 - 23:58.000:  watches and followers. No of other cases of the last year and a half where Afghan women have
23:58.000 - 24:03.440:  been prevented from getting on aircraft. It's been an interesting couple of days because a couple of
24:03.440 - 24:08.740:  days ago we see a founder of the Taliban say that many Afghans don't support. Many in the Taliban
24:08.740 - 24:13.880:  don't support this ban on young women and girls getting an education or this partial ban of women
24:13.880 - 24:18.520:  in the workplace. The Taliban then follow that up a day later by banning women from going to a
24:18.520 - 24:23.700:  national park. Now these young girls can't go to Dubai. It seems as though there is an element of
24:23.880 - 24:28.760:  discord within the Taliban. Where do you see that going? How do you see that developing?
24:29.240 - 24:35.960:  We've known about this discord for a while now. There are frictions within. There is a sort of
24:37.440 - 24:43.060:  you know, there's a tug of war for power between the Taliban in Kabul versus the Taliban in
24:43.060 - 24:48.680:  Kandahar. Now we are told by the Taliban in Kabul that those in Kandahar are the hardliners.
24:48.680 - 24:54.400:  They're the ones calling the shots. They're the ones imposing the ban and there is concern that
24:54.400 - 25:00.040:  any if anyone sort of tries to defy any Taliban leaders that try and defy this other than making
25:00.040 - 25:06.520:  public statements. It could lead to an internal sort of civil war almost if you if you will.
25:06.940 - 25:12.460:  And that is what a lot of Afghans are concerned about. They've had 40 years of conflict and war.
25:12.800 - 25:19.020:  So there is this feeling that we'll sort of see how this plays out before anyone makes any
25:19.020 - 25:24.780:  sort of moves. But I have never seen the situation in the country this bleak, this hopeless.
25:25.400 - 25:29.580:  I was there in February of this year. And as you say, I often speak to Afghan women and girls
25:29.580 - 25:36.040:  about their situation. And there is a feeling of desperation because this is the generation that
25:36.040 - 25:38.880:  tasted freedom and that freedom has been taken away from them.
25:39.320 - 25:46.020:  Insight an analysis there from Yalda Haki. Two separate studies have concluded that ultra-process
25:46.020 - 25:50.440:  food significantly increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.
25:50.440 - 25:56.360:  The findings were presented at a conference in Amsterdam. In the UK, ultra-process food makes
25:56.360 - 26:02.200:  up on average about 55% of people's diets. A health correspondent Dominic Hughes reports.
26:03.020 - 26:07.360:  Ultra-process foods are products that have been substantially altered through industrial
26:07.360 - 26:12.580:  methods such as hydrogenation and molding and may contain additives like dye, stabilizers,
26:12.580 - 26:18.300:  flavor enhancers and emulsifiers. They're often high in sugar, salt and fats, but they're also
26:18.300 - 26:24.500:  relatively cheap and plentiful, including items as diverse as cereals and mass produced bread to
26:24.500 - 26:30.260:  fizzy drinks and fast food. Now a study in China has found those who ate the most ultra-process
26:30.260 - 26:35.640:  products were nearly 25% more likely to suffer from a heart attack, stroke or in China.
26:36.180 - 26:40.980:  In a separate study in Sydney, scientists found that in a group of 10,000 middle-aged women,
26:40.980 - 26:46.440:  those with the highest proportion of ultra-processed food in their diets were 39% more likely
26:46.440 - 26:50.080:  to develop high blood pressure when compared with those with the lowest intake.
26:50.080 - 26:55.740:  Anusria Pant, the University of Sydney, one of the report's authors, says many people are unaware
26:55.740 - 27:01.940:  that foods they assume are healthy, wraps or soups or low-fat yogurts are in fact ultra-processed.
27:02.280 - 27:07.360:  The nutrient-profile ultra-processed food is inherently not very good for our heart.
27:07.360 - 27:13.900:  Health ultra-processed food is high in sodium, added sugars, low in fiber. This has led to a
27:13.900 - 27:17.960:  dye that is low in fresh, minimally processed foods like fruit, vegetables and whole grains,
27:17.960 - 27:22.240:  and we all know that eating these leads to better cardiovascular profile.
27:22.580 - 27:27.760:  The problem for the UK is that ultra-processed foods make up more than half the average
27:27.760 - 27:33.160:  British diet, and the levels are higher among the young and the poor. Georgina Perry runs a
27:33.160 - 27:38.280:  food charity in the heartcliff area of Bristol. She says that while fresh food is healthier,
27:38.280 - 27:43.940:  it's also more expensive, and in the middle of a cost of living crisis, that becomes the decisive
27:43.940 - 27:48.820:  factor. Families don't want to take a risk. They don't want to spend money on fresh fruit and
27:48.820 - 27:53.820:  vegetables, that perhaps the children or members of the family won't eat. And what is available
27:53.820 - 27:58.900:  and what is unknown quantity because people will eat it because their pallets have become
27:58.900 - 28:04.120:  accustomed to it, ultra-processed foods. Experts say that much more research is needed
28:04.120 - 28:08.880:  into what impact these ultra-processed foods are having on our health, particularly as this
28:08.880 - 28:13.920:  research suggests it's not just the high sugar, salt and fat content that could be harming us,
28:14.320 - 28:17.820:  but something more intrinsic to the way these products are manufactured.
28:18.340 - 28:23.260:  Now report there by Dominic Hughes. Next to Lebanon, the countries in the midst of a huge
28:23.260 - 28:28.580:  economic crisis, inflation and triple figures, a banking system that's collapsed. The currency
28:28.580 - 28:34.460:  there, the Lebanese pound or Lyra in Arabic, is in freefall, but wine industry is bucking the trend.
28:34.460 - 28:40.420:  Wine is booming, and McCarthy reports. I'm Angela Winefair in Beirut.
28:41.640 - 28:46.240:  Lebanon currently produces over seven and a half million bottles of wine every year,
28:46.780 - 28:50.260:  and for decades, it has been one of the country's few successful exports.
28:51.140 - 28:56.760:  Even now, while Lebanon is going through a severe financial crisis, new wineries have been continuing
28:56.760 - 29:02.260:  to open. Three years ago, we just started buramenting with different types of grapes and varieties,
29:02.260 - 29:08.160:  but last year we actually said that's it, that's to our own wine. So this year we're releasing our
29:08.160 - 29:14.240:  first two wines. Under here, here means she in Arabic. Despite the interest in Lebanese wine,
29:14.240 - 29:19.860:  power cuts in the banking crisis have created major obstacles for people like Michelle Shami,
29:19.860 - 29:24.820:  who are launching their new wines. You go to work on something, and then there's no electricity.
29:25.020 - 29:31.440:  Just trying to get money out of the bank is difficult. Just so many struggles that, I guess,
29:31.440 - 29:35.920:  is just native to here and that people don't understand unless they've actually been here.
29:36.300 - 29:40.960:  So yeah, these are the tough things about living here and making wine here.
29:42.540 - 29:46.980:  Gaston Hoshar's family has been making wine in Lebanon for three generations.
29:47.760 - 29:53.720:  Shadr Mazar is bottled on a mountain overlooking the town of Ghazir, and today can be found in stores
29:53.720 - 30:00.900:  around the world. Today we ship worldwide all the wines, except the Koray, but they all exist a
30:00.900 - 30:06.480:  little bit everywhere. We're not concentrating on specific markets. Market goes down, you have
30:06.480 - 30:11.680:  other which compensate. Gaston knows all about the challenges of making an exporting wine from
30:11.680 - 30:17.540:  Lebanon. Today you have nearly 60 producers a number. It's not an easy market. It's not at all
30:17.540 - 30:22.060:  easy to export. This year is challenging because you have a lot of things happening all over the
30:22.060 - 30:28.440:  world between inflation and Ukraine, Russian war, but we have a certain resilience here.
30:28.440 - 30:34.480:  The one thing Gaston isn't worried about is demand for Lebanese wine. People who are knowledgeable
30:34.540 - 30:40.880:  in wine realize that these tastes are not often found all over the world, and it's therefore if they
30:40.880 - 30:46.560:  want these characters, then they have to buy Mazar. And therefore the demand is there and I'm not
30:46.560 - 30:51.960:  afraid it's going to disappear. Amidst all the economic gloom in Lebanon, Lebanese wine looks
30:52.020 - 30:56.140:  set to remain one of the few bright lights for the country for some time to come.
30:56.820 - 31:02.540:  From Lebanon, that was Hanema coffee. Let's stick with alcohol because Japan has some of the
31:02.540 - 31:08.400:  strictest laws around drink driving. But now a new study there is taking a somewhat unorthodox
31:08.400 - 31:14.060:  approach to preventing it by encouraging drivers to consume alcohol. Stephanie Prentice told me more.
31:14.760 - 31:19.420:  This is a joint initiative between the police there and driving instructors and they're trying
31:19.420 - 31:24.680:  to tackle what they call overconfidence when it comes to driving under the influence. So they
31:24.680 - 31:30.240:  set up three sections of road. There's a slalom track of obstacles, an S-shaped sort of bend
31:30.240 - 31:36.620:  in a series of tight curves. Then they got drivers to do those tracks sober. After that they gave
31:36.620 - 31:42.240:  the drivers a mix of beer, plum wine, and this Japanese spirit called Shochu to get the blood
31:42.240 - 31:47.560:  alcohol levels up to twice the legal threshold for driving, then sent them back off around those
31:47.560 - 31:53.440:  courses. On the obstacles, the S-band, the tight curves, the beer plum wine and the spirit resulted
31:53.580 - 31:59.600:  in what results? Well, unsurprisingly, this is where it got interesting because the drivers said
31:59.600 - 32:04.760:  they felt like they were able to drive. Something police say that people court drink driving often say
32:05.260 - 32:09.800:  the results told a different story. As one person who set off with a passenger, she thought she
32:09.800 - 32:15.380:  completed the ballads on the slalom really well. Then was told she'd been repeatedly accelerating
32:15.460 - 32:20.180:  and breaking so hard that her passenger was being lurched around, she'd veered into the wrong
32:20.180 - 32:25.560:  lane, she headed into the S-band at such a high speed that the team stopped her from taking it on.
32:26.100 - 32:32.220:  Those results were pretty standard across the board. Therein said the researchers lies the major
32:32.220 - 32:37.060:  point. Drivers think they're okay to drive. They might even avoid any noticeable incidents,
32:37.080 - 32:42.440:  but the skills we honour that are needed to drive like cognitive capacity, judgment and
32:42.440 - 32:48.140:  dare say motor skills. Those are impaired, but the driver thinks they're driving safely. So the
32:48.140 - 32:53.680:  team are asking other drivers and journalists to come in, give the court a go after some plum
32:53.680 - 32:58.800:  wine themselves, and that's all to try and raise awareness of the dangers of that overconfidence
32:58.800 - 33:03.680:  behind the wheel. Our very own plum wine drinker, Stephanie Prentice, they're reminding us all
33:03.680 - 33:10.480:  not to drink and drive. Now, the much anticipated opening of a recently discovered time capsule at
33:10.480 - 33:16.780:  the US Military Academy at West Point has revealed something rather unexpected. A hushed audience
33:16.780 - 33:22.240:  of cadets and officials and gathered amid some considerable excitement at the famed institution
33:22.240 - 33:27.840:  in New York to see what secrets the small grey-led box had been concealing for nine on two
33:27.840 - 33:32.140:  hundred years. Where a Davis lifts the lid on what happens next.
33:32.540 - 33:37.900:  The time capsule, as it had been dubbed, was discovered during the recent refurbishment of a statue
33:37.900 - 33:43.700:  to the Revolutionary War hero, today as Kuzushko. Most intriguingly, it's thought the box had
33:43.700 - 33:50.100:  lain undisturbed for 194 years, a period covering much of the history of the modern United States
33:50.720 - 33:57.540:  after Declaration of Independence in 1776. Initial X-ray images had failed to reveal anything conclusive
33:57.540 - 34:03.400:  because of the density of the lid, but it did suggest there was an unidentifiable mass within.
34:03.400 - 34:09.700:  As two West Point officials carefully prized open the lid, a live camera zoomed in to reveal
34:10.420 - 34:16.160:  absolutely nothing. As crestfall and dignitaries and cadets tried to contain their disappointment,
34:16.880 - 34:22.040:  perhaps the ghosts of West Point students from almost two centuries ago were enjoying
34:22.040 - 34:25.540:  having played the ultimate practical joke on their successes.
34:26.080 - 34:30.460:  You can see a video of that unveiling on our website at BBC.com, slashing news. That was
34:30.460 - 34:36.600:  Where a Davis. And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the
34:36.600 - 34:40.220:  Global News Podcast, a little later. If you want to come into this one or any of the topics,
