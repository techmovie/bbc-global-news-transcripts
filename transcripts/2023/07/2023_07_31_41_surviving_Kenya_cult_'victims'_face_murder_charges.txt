00:25.300 - 00:28.480:  But to those thousands of cars have personality like Old Betsy?
00:28.580 - 00:31.980:  Betsy is held together by tape and their raccoons are being in the engine.
00:32.140 - 00:33.340:  It's a family car.
00:33.600 - 00:35.200:  Uh, there are flames on the hood.
00:35.400 - 00:36.540:  Bad custom paint job.

00:55.320 - 00:58.120:  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Tuesday,
00:58.120 - 01:00.620:  the first of August, these are our main stories.
01:01.260 - 01:04.180:  41 people rescued from a doomsday caught in Kenya
01:04.180 - 01:07.760:  are to be charged with murder and other offences alongside their leader,
01:08.300 - 01:12.320:  another current burning in Sweden prompts fury from leading Islamic countries
01:12.860 - 01:16.140:  and a special report on a major discovery in Ghana.
01:16.600 - 01:20.160:  It's the first English outpost established anywhere in Africa.
01:20.160 - 01:25.820:  It's the very period when the shift occurs between the focus on the trade in gold
01:25.820 - 01:28.060:  to the focus on the trade in slaves.
01:31.000 - 01:36.040:  Also in this podcast, the US holds its first direct talks with Taliban representatives
01:36.040 - 01:38.440:  who took over Afghanistan two years ago.
01:38.720 - 01:45.060:  And why people can barely work out if an animal in a Chinese zoo is a real bear or a fake one.
01:48.740 - 01:50.520:  We start with a harrowing story.
01:50.520 - 01:54.060:  We've been reporting on for months about the ongoing discovery of bodies
01:54.060 - 01:58.240:  thought to be members of a cult in mass graves in Kenya's Shaqola forest.
01:58.240 - 02:01.560:  Hundreds have been exhumed and 41 people have been rescued.
02:01.900 - 02:06.040:  While on Monday, those survivors were told that to be charged alongside the leader
02:06.480 - 02:08.120:  with murder and other offences.
02:08.500 - 02:10.040:  The cult's leader, Paul McKenzie,
02:10.040 - 02:13.400:  is accused of encouraging his followers to starve themselves to death
02:13.720 - 02:16.580:  to enter heaven before the world ended with more details.
02:16.580 - 02:18.020:  Here's Dorkas Wangira.
02:18.540 - 02:21.540:  The court hired at the 41 victims now suspects
02:21.540 - 02:26.120:  left their homes for the Shaqola forest in the company of at least 40 children.
02:26.660 - 02:28.260:  The Senior Prosecution Council,
02:28.260 - 02:31.840:  father said that they accused 28 women and 13 men
02:32.160 - 02:35.040:  are either parents or grandparents of the missing children.
02:35.560 - 02:36.740:  According to investigators,
02:37.360 - 02:40.080:  most of them used false names to identify themselves,
02:40.180 - 02:43.520:  father frustrating efforts to gather crucial evidence.
02:43.540 - 02:46.620:  The magistrate ordered that all the 41 suspects
02:46.620 - 02:50.100:  be detained at the Shimola Tower prison southeast in Kenya
02:50.480 - 02:53.380:  and presented in court Tuesday, August 1st.
02:53.680 - 02:55.500:  Paul McKenzie, the suspected leader,
02:55.900 - 02:58.580:  is also scheduled to appear in court the same day.
02:59.120 - 03:03.360:  So far, the death toll linked to the cult stands at 425.
03:03.360 - 03:06.420:  More than 600 people are still missing.
03:07.060 - 03:08.020:  Dorkas Wangira.
03:09.060 - 03:11.920:  The right to freedom of expression in Sweden and Denmark
03:11.920 - 03:13.360:  is being pushed to its limits
03:13.380 - 03:15.760:  as the public desecration of the Qur'an
03:15.920 - 03:18.800:  in recent weeks has sparked tensions with several Muslim countries.
03:18.800 - 03:22.480:  An extraordinary meeting of the organization of Islamic cooperation
03:22.480 - 03:24.340:  has been held to discuss the issue.
03:24.820 - 03:25.900:  And its secretary-general,
03:25.960 - 03:27.720:  Hisein Brahim Taha,
03:28.200 - 03:29.460:  condemns Sweden and Denmark
03:29.460 - 03:31.520:  for not putting a stop to these acts.
03:32.120 - 03:35.100:  You're regrettable that the concerned authorities
03:35.100 - 03:36.940:  claiming freedom of expression
03:37.580 - 03:40.780:  continue to provide licenses to repeat these acts.
03:41.140 - 03:43.200:  Contrary to international law.
03:44.980 - 03:47.920:  To Iraqi-born activists staged another Qur'an
03:47.920 - 03:50.060:  burning today outside Parliament in Stockholm.
03:50.560 - 03:52.380:  They also stamped on the book's pages.
03:52.380 - 03:55.500:  Sweden and Denmark say they reject Islamophobia
03:55.500 - 03:58.020:  but have to strike a balance between freedom of speech
03:58.360 - 03:59.820:  with strict laws on protests.
03:59.900 - 04:03.240:  I heard more from our Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher.
04:03.620 - 04:06.820:  I think the main point of the meeting was that it was held
04:06.940 - 04:08.420:  as you say, it was an extraordinary meeting.
04:08.480 - 04:10.160:  It wasn't one that had been scheduled
04:10.360 - 04:11.620:  for any great length of time.
04:11.620 - 04:14.320:  It comes as these acts of desecration
04:14.320 - 04:15.720:  against the Qur'an continue.
04:16.100 - 04:17.100:  So there's very much a message
04:17.400 - 04:19.300:  to the governments of Sweden and Denmark
04:19.300 - 04:21.100:  to take action as we were hearing there.
04:21.640 - 04:22.860:  From the head of the OIC,
04:22.860 - 04:25.280:  the OIC is based in Saudi Arabia.
04:25.280 - 04:30.300:  It's seen at times as being very much kind of tool of Saudi Arabia.
04:30.300 - 04:31.340:  But it goes beyond that.
04:31.340 - 04:33.780:  There's more than 50 Islamic countries that are involved in it.
04:33.940 - 04:36.060:  And this meeting was called by the Saudis
04:36.100 - 04:36.760:  and by Iraq.
04:36.900 - 04:39.980:  Iraq has seen probably the biggest protests
04:40.800 - 04:44.160:  against these acts of desecration in the past few weeks.
04:44.660 - 04:45.960:  So I think those of the two countries
04:45.960 - 04:47.260:  which are kind of leading this.
04:47.720 - 04:50.040:  And as I say, that message wasn't couched
04:50.040 - 04:52.580:  in any particularly extreme terms.
04:52.800 - 04:57.760:  It was really just another voice trying to tell Sweden
04:57.760 - 05:00.100:  and Denmark the authorities to take action
05:00.100 - 05:03.660:  as I think Iraq and many Islamic countries
05:04.340 - 05:06.780:  directly hold Sweden and Denmark.
05:06.780 - 05:10.100:  The government's there as being responsible for what's happening
05:10.280 - 05:11.920:  even if that isn't exactly the case.
05:12.040 - 05:14.180:  Other Swedish authorities likely to take any notice?
05:14.600 - 05:16.460:  Absolutely, they've been taking notice.
05:16.540 - 05:18.680:  They've been very much distancing themselves
05:19.020 - 05:21.020:  from what's been going on and trying to make clear
05:21.020 - 05:23.800:  that it's nothing to do with the government as such.
05:23.920 - 05:25.340:  I mean, there's a law of free speech
05:25.580 - 05:27.780:  and it's the police that make these decisions.
05:27.940 - 05:29.280:  But just as Denmark has done,
05:29.280 - 05:31.160:  and Denmark has been stronger on this,
05:31.300 - 05:33.400:  it's making clear that it wants to change that
05:33.400 - 05:36.840:  and it wants to stop these incidents continuing
05:36.840 - 05:39.700:  and saying that they essentially pose
05:40.300 - 05:42.440:  one of the most serious threats that the countries
05:43.040 - 05:44.300:  have faced in years.
05:44.800 - 05:47.320:  Even if these are protests, if one can call them that,
05:47.320 - 05:50.180:  which are being staged by an absolutely minuscule amount
05:50.180 - 05:50.620:  of people.
05:51.100 - 05:53.200:  Yeah, and the consequences can be really serious
05:53.500 - 05:55.280:  in countries in the Muslim world.
05:55.280 - 05:57.780:  People die in the protests that result there, don't they?
05:58.700 - 05:59.480:  I mean, absolutely.
05:59.480 - 06:02.420:  And that obviously must be being born in mind
06:02.420 - 06:04.080:  by Swedish and Danish authorities.
06:04.080 - 06:06.460:  I mean, I think part of the thing with the OIC
06:06.460 - 06:09.080:  is that the biggest protests we've seen
06:09.360 - 06:12.000:  have been kind of non-government organized protests
06:12.000 - 06:14.260:  in Iraq as they're saying where the biggest ones happened.
06:14.300 - 06:16.800:  They've been essentially by supporters
06:16.800 - 06:18.480:  of a very powerful Shia cleric,
06:18.520 - 06:19.580:  then, Maktara Al-Sada,
06:19.780 - 06:22.240:  who has often raised himself against the government.
06:22.300 - 06:25.140:  It's part of that pressure that is being put.
06:25.700 - 06:28.680:  I think there's an attempt of a kind of moderation
06:28.800 - 06:29.920:  on all sides here.
06:30.080 - 06:31.380:  But the two people at the heart of this,
06:31.380 - 06:34.980:  these two Iraqi-born activists don't seem to want to stop.
06:35.180 - 06:37.360:  And they can cause extreme consequences,
06:37.840 - 06:40.120:  even though it's only two people who are doing this.
06:40.560 - 06:41.580:  Sebastian Asha.
06:42.400 - 06:44.940:  For the first time ever, Israel Supreme Court has said
06:44.940 - 06:47.740:  that all 15 of its judges will take part in a hearing
06:47.740 - 06:50.880:  on arguments against a highly controversial new law.
06:51.080 - 06:53.160:  The change limits the court's powers
06:53.160 - 06:54.840:  to overall some government decisions.
06:55.440 - 06:57.060:  And it's part of a judicial overhaul
06:57.060 - 06:58.600:  that has sparked months of protests
06:58.620 - 07:01.040:  and an unprecedented crisis in the country.
07:01.440 - 07:03.520:  From Jerusalem, here's our Middle East correspondent,
07:03.520 - 07:04.480:  Yolanda Nell.
07:04.720 - 07:06.740:  This decision by the Supreme Court president
07:06.740 - 07:08.560:  is a measure of the huge significance
07:08.560 - 07:10.580:  of the legislation passed last week
07:10.580 - 07:13.380:  by Israel's religious nationalist coalition government.
07:13.380 - 07:16.500:  And it sets a stage for a constitutional showdown
07:16.780 - 07:18.760:  when petitions to strike down the new law
07:18.760 - 07:19.980:  are heard in September.
07:20.460 - 07:23.620:  The amendment to basic law prohibits Israel's highest courts
07:23.620 - 07:25.920:  from reviewing some decisions made by the government
07:25.920 - 07:29.400:  and ministers judging them against a standard of reasonableness.
07:29.460 - 07:32.720:  The coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
07:33.040 - 07:35.940:  argues that it's needed to prevent overreach by the court,
07:36.340 - 07:38.500:  which it sees as increasingly intervening
07:38.500 - 07:39.580:  in political decisions.
07:40.180 - 07:42.680:  Critics say the changes remove important checks
07:42.680 - 07:45.800:  on the government and could lead to abuses of power.
07:46.100 - 07:47.000:  Yolanda Nell.
07:47.600 - 07:49.880:  Reports from Niger say dozens of officials
07:49.880 - 07:52.940:  from the party of the deposed president, Mohammed Bazoum,
07:53.080 - 07:53.960:  have been arrested.
07:53.960 - 07:56.960:  They include the party leader and several government ministers.
07:56.960 - 08:00.060:  Mr. Bazoum himself remains a captive of the army,
08:00.060 - 08:01.540:  but pictures of him have been released
08:01.540 - 08:04.020:  for the first time since last week's coup.
08:04.380 - 08:07.380:  The United States has reiterated that any assistance to Niger
08:07.880 - 08:10.280:  depends on the country returning to democratic rule.
08:10.280 - 08:13.560:  The deputy spokesman of the State Department, Matthew Miller,
08:13.860 - 08:16.660:  said the US was monitoring the situation very carefully.
08:17.220 - 08:18.820:  It is clear that there has been an attempt
08:18.820 - 08:21.000:  to remove President Bazoum from office.
08:21.480 - 08:23.200:  We are watching monitoring the situation
08:23.200 - 08:25.620:  and trying to prevent President Bazoum
08:25.620 - 08:27.000:  from being removed from office.
08:27.560 - 08:29.400:  But Secretary Blinken has made very clear
08:29.900 - 08:32.960:  that the hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance
08:32.960 - 08:36.500:  that the US has provided and has continued to provide to Niger
08:36.500 - 08:38.140:  is very much in the balance,
08:38.140 - 08:40.940:  depending on the outcome of the actions in the country.
08:40.960 - 08:44.420:  US assistance hinges on continued democratic governance
08:44.420 - 08:45.300:  in Niger.
08:45.800 - 08:48.440:  On Monday, the US also confirmed that its top general
08:48.440 - 08:50.860:  had spoken to the leader of Nishia's military
08:50.860 - 08:54.600:  about the safety of American citizens following last week's coup.
08:54.880 - 08:56.980:  The President of Chad has been in Nishia
08:56.980 - 09:00.320:  to try to resolve the crisis after the West African regional
09:00.320 - 09:02.080:  block echo asked gave the military
09:02.080 - 09:05.120:  until next Sunday to reinstate Mr. Bazoum
09:05.380 - 09:07.680:  or face possible military intervention.
09:07.680 - 09:11.120:  Chris Awaka sent this update from Abuja in Nigeria.
09:11.860 - 09:14.140:  The executive office of the Nigerian party
09:14.140 - 09:17.120:  for democratic esotericism, PNDS Taraia,
09:17.420 - 09:19.760:  confirmed to the BBC that a party leader
09:20.040 - 09:22.280:  from Makoegado and the Minister of Petroleum,
09:22.340 - 09:25.440:  Maman Sani Mahmoudu, where among those arrested.
09:26.300 - 09:28.880:  Earlier, the new military government alleged that
09:28.880 - 09:31.080:  foreign minister Hassoumi Masoudou
09:31.260 - 09:33.420:  asked France to lead a military operation
09:33.420 - 09:35.460:  to rescue President Mohammad Bazoum
09:35.580 - 09:36.740:  from the presidential palace.
09:37.420 - 09:39.180:  France has denied this accusation.
09:39.480 - 09:41.680:  Why insisting that it is still possible
09:41.680 - 09:43.560:  to raise state the outside president?
09:44.320 - 09:46.980:  It comes as Chadian president Mohammad Idris Debbie
09:46.980 - 09:50.360:  leads mediation efforts to resolve the crisis in Niger.
09:50.860 - 09:51.580:  Chris Awaka.
09:51.940 - 09:52.980:  And some news just in.
09:52.980 - 09:56.400:  Bikina Faso and Mali have issued a joint statement
09:56.400 - 09:59.060:  saying they would regard any military intervention
09:59.100 - 10:01.440:  in Niger as a declaration of war on them.
10:01.440 - 10:04.600:  The two military rule countries said in such a scenario
10:04.920 - 10:07.500:  they would come to the defence of their eastern neighbour.
10:08.980 - 10:12.060:  The prominent Russian dissident Vladimir Karamursa
10:12.280 - 10:15.420:  has lost an appeal against his 25-year jail sentence.
10:15.420 - 10:18.440:  He was arrested soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine
10:18.440 - 10:20.100:  and found guilty of treason
10:20.100 - 10:22.440:  and spreading false information about the war.
10:22.440 - 10:25.780:  Mr. Karamursa also has British nationality
10:25.800 - 10:27.800:  and the UK has sanctioned judges
10:28.160 - 10:29.880:  and prosecutors involved in the case.
10:30.300 - 10:32.380:  One of his supporters, Gregory Yavlinsky,
10:32.780 - 10:33.920:  has been giving his reaction
10:33.920 - 10:36.080:  to our Russia editor, Steve Rosenberg,
10:36.360 - 10:37.940:  who sent this report from Moscow.
10:40.040 - 10:42.080:  He came to court with little hope,
10:43.100 - 10:44.300:  but lots of support.
10:46.520 - 10:48.800:  And for that, Vladimir Karamursa
10:49.300 - 10:50.240:  was clearly grateful.
10:51.120 - 10:52.640:  In April, the Kremlin critic
10:53.060 - 10:54.400:  had been convicted of treason
10:55.180 - 10:57.920:  and sentenced to a quarter of a century in prison.
10:59.220 - 11:00.560:  This was his appeal hearing.
11:02.260 - 11:05.580:  The result, as expected, appeal rejected.
11:08.280 - 11:11.340:  Vladimir Karamursa is one of Russia's most prominence
11:11.340 - 11:14.180:  opposition politicians for a long time
11:14.180 - 11:16.320:  a thorn in the Kremlin side.
11:17.260 - 11:18.620:  He lobbied Western governments
11:19.020 - 11:21.280:  to impose sanctions on Russian officials
11:21.300 - 11:23.580:  for corruption and human rights abuses.
11:24.480 - 11:26.200:  He denounced the war in Ukraine.
11:27.060 - 11:29.500:  He holds Russian and British citizenship.
11:30.040 - 11:30.960:  It's very painful.
11:30.960 - 11:33.100:  He supporters condemned the ruling.
11:33.240 - 11:37.300:  25 years, it's something unbelievable.
11:38.560 - 11:39.940:  He's a strong man which
11:41.580 - 11:44.980:  want to make the better future for Russia.
11:45.440 - 11:46.760:  So the conviction stands.
11:46.820 - 11:50.700:  The 25-year prison sentence remains unchanged.
11:51.540 - 11:53.800:  But in a country where the crackdown on dissent
11:53.800 - 11:55.980:  is accelerating, the failure
11:56.200 - 11:57.780:  of Vladimir Karamursa's appeal
11:58.480 - 11:59.500:  comes as little surprise.
12:00.000 - 12:01.520:  Yeah, I'm like, over the weekend,
12:01.660 - 12:05.080:  Vladimir Putin made it clear what he thinks of dissent.
12:05.780 - 12:08.020:  A reporter asked whether it was normal
12:08.020 - 12:09.480:  for people to be arrested,
12:09.480 - 12:11.620:  for things they've written or said.
12:14.780 - 12:18.040:  The Russian Federation is in a state of armed conflict
12:18.080 - 12:18.920:  with her neighbor.
12:19.760 - 12:22.280:  I think there should be a certain attitude
12:22.980 - 12:25.260:  towards those people who are causing harm
12:25.980 - 12:26.760:  inside the country.
12:29.080 - 12:31.280:  Back in court, friends, he says,
12:31.760 - 12:32.720:  everything will be okay.
12:35.360 - 12:36.540:  Freedom, they shout.
12:37.540 - 12:38.480:  That's optimistic.
12:39.240 - 12:40.700:  For Vladimir Karamursa,
12:41.360 - 12:43.340:  freedom feels a long way off.
12:44.960 - 12:45.840:  Steve Rosenberg.
12:48.780 - 12:51.380:  Still to come in the Global News podcast.
12:51.460 - 12:55.180:  Tobacco use continues to be one of the biggest
12:55.180 - 12:58.740:  public health threats with 8.7 million people
12:58.740 - 13:02.140:  dying from tobacco-related diseases every year.
13:02.480 - 13:04.260:  Why smoking is still the biggest
13:04.260 - 13:05.900:  preventable killer in the world?
13:14.580 - 13:15.700:  The United States has held its first direct negotiations
13:16.680 - 13:18.160:  with Taliban representatives who regained control
13:18.160 - 13:19.960:  of Afghanistan two years ago.
13:19.960 - 13:22.220:  The US State Department said Washington was open
13:22.380 - 13:25.140:  to talks on economic stability and combating
13:26.360 - 13:28.120:  narcotics trafficking and also repeated concerns
13:29.540 - 13:30.300:  about deteriorating human rights.
13:30.860 - 13:32.440:  Since the Taliban took over in 2021,
13:33.140 - 13:35.860:  girls in Afghanistan have been banned from secondary school
13:37.300 - 13:38.540:  and women from tertiary education.
13:38.940 - 13:42.120:  Women and girls also can't enter amusement parks,
13:42.860 - 13:45.840:  public baths, gyms and sports clubs from Washington.
13:45.860 - 13:46.620:  Here's Sean Dilly.
13:47.580 - 13:49.000:  The US State Department said it made clear
13:49.080 - 13:51.780:  its concerns about deteriorating human rights
13:51.980 - 13:52.780:  in Afghanistan.
13:55.020 - 13:55.320:  The officials called on the Taliban-controlled
13:55.640 - 13:58.360:  administration to reverse bans on secondary education
13:58.360 - 14:00.860:  for girls and employment for women.
14:00.860 - 14:03.620:  And they called for the release of detained Americans.
14:03.980 - 14:05.760:  They said they would be prepared to hold
14:05.760 - 14:06.560:  future discussions on combating narcotics
14:11.960 - 14:13.440:  and to discuss economic stability and inflation in Afghanistan.
14:13.460 - 14:15.000:  The Taliban administration, which calls itself
14:16.240 - 14:18.100:  the Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan,
14:18.100 - 14:19.740:  called for travel restrictions to be lifted for its leaders
14:21.160 - 14:23.380:  and for the country's assets to be unfrozen.
14:24.760 - 14:25.540:  Sean Dilly in Washington.
14:30.220 - 14:30.640:  Tobacco is still the main cause of global deaths
14:30.640 - 14:32.640:  that could be prevented according to the world health
14:33.920 - 14:33.940:  organization.
14:34.120 - 14:36.400:  Regulations on smoking are making a difference,
14:36.400 - 14:37.460:  but Dr. Rudiga Crash from the WHO
14:41.520 - 14:42.840:  said that smoking was still resulting in too many fatalities.
14:45.560 - 14:45.900:  Let's not forget that tobacco use continues
14:48.700 - 14:49.040:  to be one of the biggest public health threats
14:51.660 - 14:53.820:  with 8.7 million people dying from tobacco-related diseases
14:55.000 - 14:55.240:  every year.
14:57.840 - 15:00.480:  1.3 million of these deaths are amongst non-smokers.
15:03.140 - 15:04.480:  That are subjected to second-hand smoke.
15:06.740 - 15:09.480:  But more than 2 billion people in 44 countries remain unprotected,
15:11.500 - 15:12.500:  which the WHO has said is unacceptable.
15:14.220 - 15:15.560:  But it's not all bad news as Imogen folks in Geneva told me.
15:15.660 - 15:19.520:  I mean, it's 15 years since the WHO first started
15:21.640 - 15:24.460:  pushing these recommendations on tobacco control towards countries.
15:26.660 - 15:27.520:  And now, many countries have adopted
15:27.800 - 15:30.500:  if not all, then some of them.
15:30.500 - 15:34.300:  So we've got 70% of the world's population.
15:34.300 - 15:38.480:  That's 5.6 billion people are protected in some way or other.
15:38.480 - 15:42.440:  That could be no smoking in the indoor public spaces.
15:43.720 - 15:46.440:  It could be higher tax on tobacco products.
15:46.440 - 15:51.480:  It could be very blatant packaging to show the risks.
15:51.480 - 15:55.360:  It could be cutting back on advertising and sponsorship.
15:56.220 - 15:57.980:  So all those things are happening.
15:57.980 - 16:02.420:  Well, the WHO is saying today is they need to happen more widely
16:02.460 - 16:05.960:  and that countries should adopt all of these measures and not just some.
16:06.300 - 16:08.640:  Why are there still so many deaths, though?
16:09.600 - 16:11.420:  Well, you heard in the introduction there,
16:11.460 - 16:14.560:  some countries have not adopted any of these measures.
16:15.100 - 16:17.440:  Some countries have only adopted a couple.
16:17.580 - 16:24.340:  And I think the focus the WHO has got this year is not just on stopping people starting smoking.
16:24.340 - 16:25.600:  That does seem to be working.
16:25.600 - 16:30.640:  Numbers of smokers are going down, but to really protect people from second-hand smoke.
16:31.180 - 16:33.800:  Of those over 8 million deaths a year.
16:34.200 - 16:38.820:  Over a million are from people who don't smoke at all, but are affected by second-hand smoke.
16:38.880 - 16:42.680:  So that's the push the WHO is making this year.
16:42.680 - 16:47.020:  Is really let's stop smoking in all public spaces,
16:47.020 - 16:53.000:  whether it's train stations, pubs, bars, cafes, restaurants, health facilities, of course.
16:53.180 - 16:57.740:  All of these things should really be thought about now and implemented by governments.
16:58.060 - 17:02.060:  Briefly imagine the WHO wants a smoke-free generation by 2040.
17:02.060 - 17:03.020:  Is this achievable?
17:03.480 - 17:04.560:  It thinks it can.
17:04.560 - 17:10.120:  If, as we said at the beginning, all of the countries adopt all of the measures.
17:10.120 - 17:13.160:  At the moment, we've got some of the countries and some of the measures.
17:13.700 - 17:16.420:  It's an ambitious target. 2040's not far away.
17:16.920 - 17:22.320:  But the WHO thinks it could be done given the evidence that even adopting some of the measures
17:22.320 - 17:24.360:  shows it's having a positive effect.
17:24.900 - 17:28.500:  Imogen folks in Geneva, where the WHO is headquartered.
17:29.340 - 17:34.400:  The UN's cultural agency UNESCO is recommending that Venice should be added to its list
17:34.440 - 17:36.360:  of endangered world heritage sites.
17:36.800 - 17:40.440:  It said the Italian authorities had failed to address the problems faced by the city
17:40.980 - 17:42.280:  and it's surrounding the Goon.
17:42.380 - 17:46.140:  The recommendation will be put to the organisation's next meeting in September,
17:46.560 - 17:47.800:  so fear but it still reports.
17:48.480 - 17:53.320:  The city of Venice is known as La Serenissima, which means very serene.
17:53.880 - 17:55.780:  But that nickname no longer fits.
17:56.640 - 18:02.820:  UNESCO says the city is at risk of irreversible damage because of overwhelming tourism
18:03.300 - 18:06.320:  and urban developments such as high-rise buildings.
18:06.940 - 18:09.820:  Climate change is also having a negative impact.
18:10.500 - 18:15.720:  It's causing a rise in sea levels, so Venice, which is surrounded by water,
18:16.160 - 18:18.100:  is very vulnerable to flooding.
18:18.100 - 18:24.000:  The UNESCO report blames the Italian authorities for a lack of strategic vision
18:24.540 - 18:29.160:  to solve the problems faced by one of Italy's most picturesque cities.
18:29.720 - 18:30.880:  So fear but it's up.
18:31.680 - 18:36.120:  Garners coastline still bears the memory and the remnants of the slave trade.
18:36.120 - 18:42.040:  Along a 560 km stretch, there are more than 20 slave forts and trading ports,
18:42.460 - 18:46.440:  including Cape Coast Castle, now one of the country's biggest tourist attractions.
18:46.460 - 18:50.820:  As far back as the 1600s, these buildings were used by European traders
18:51.220 - 18:54.940:  as the base from which to ship gold and also to traffic humans.
18:55.380 - 18:59.800:  Archaeologists have been exploring for years and now they've made an extraordinary discovery
18:59.800 - 19:05.480:  which could reveal new information about this troubled period, the BBC's Thomas Nardi reports.
19:08.160 - 19:11.740:  Overlooking the Atlantic Ocean at Abanze in Sardin Ghana,
19:12.160 - 19:16.440:  a team of archaeologists are busy at work inside the iconic Fort Amsterdam.
19:17.500 - 19:21.340:  Hidden underneath these forts, they have discovered the reins of a building
19:21.340 - 19:26.640:  that they believe is the earliest English slave fort in Africa, built in 1631.
19:28.360 - 19:35.200:  I'm about to enter one of the rooms where researchers are busy trying to dig up the foundation
19:35.200 - 19:39.720:  of Fort Romantin to see exactly what is going on.
19:40.000 - 19:43.740:  The graduate student that was digging here was getting discouraged.
19:44.400 - 19:49.400:  And then one day we came in and these stones, some of which you see still exposed here,
19:49.400 - 19:54.220:  he had drawn some of them and I suddenly said to him, well, that's clearly a wall.
19:54.840 - 20:00.280:  Professor Christopher the course is a chair of anthropology at the Maxwell School Syracuse University.
20:01.180 - 20:04.820:  Here in this team have been part of a three-year research project here.
20:05.420 - 20:12.800:  That, along with the artifacts that we found within these excavated levels that dated before the Dutch,
20:12.800 - 20:17.460:  this tells us that we have the foundations of the early English fort.
20:17.920 - 20:22.600:  The more recent Fort Amsterdam was built on top of the remains of the English fort
20:23.080 - 20:26.920:  after the Dutch captured it in a furious battle in 1665.
20:26.920 - 20:32.440:  It's the first English outpost established anywhere in Africa, not just modern day Ghana.
20:32.860 - 20:37.200:  And this occurs at a very, very important time in Atlantic history.
20:37.660 - 20:43.100:  It's the very period when the shift occurs between the focus on the trade in gold
20:43.100 - 20:49.300:  to the focus on the trade in slaves, which is one of the things that makes uncovering the foundations
20:50.180 - 20:52.360:  of Fort Romantin interesting.
20:54.680 - 20:55.460:  Just found something.
20:56.740 - 20:57.480:  Yeah, it's a pipe.
20:57.900 - 21:00.740:  Now, what is this one? It looks like a smoked pipe or something?
21:01.000 - 21:02.300:  Very, very fascinating.
21:02.460 - 21:08.600:  We see that this type of pipe is also very distinctive of the early 17th century.
21:09.020 - 21:11.660:  This one here in particular is tiny.
21:11.740 - 21:12.480:  Yeah, it looks smaller.
21:12.620 - 21:19.680:  The reason for that is, as you know, tobacco was a domesticated plant that was found in the Americas.
21:20.260 - 21:24.740:  So it was not used in Africa or in Europe until the Atlantic exchanges.
21:25.380 - 21:28.560:  And so when it first came to Europe and came to Africa,
21:29.180 - 21:34.240:  it, in fact, was very expensive, which is why you had little small balls.
21:37.420 - 21:39.920:  Named after a nearby village of Romanthe,
21:39.920 - 21:45.380:  thousands of men and women were possibly sent from here to the Caribbean to wake implantations.
21:46.020 - 21:50.740:  For the longest time from when it was built, there was an English corporation called the Guinea Company
21:50.740 - 21:53.260:  and they were very much interested in gold trade.
21:53.580 - 21:58.940:  Michael Javas is a professor of Atlantic and digital history at the University of Rochester.
21:59.820 - 22:04.820:  And it was only in 1663 that the King of England, Charles II,
22:04.820 - 22:08.000:  creates the royal adventurers to Africa.
22:08.340 - 22:11.920:  And their focus is slave trade rather than the gold trade.
22:12.760 - 22:19.060:  Romanthe is now the name associated with many enslaved Africans from the Gulf Coast in modern day Ghana.
22:20.440 - 22:24.280:  The research team will now continue with their excavation over the next few years.
22:24.820 - 22:30.120:  And soon, they hope to share even more details about this historic discovery.
22:32.660 - 22:34.500:  Thomas Nadi with that report.
22:35.580 - 22:40.080:  Now, what does a zoo need in its bare section?
22:40.640 - 22:45.420:  Look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities.
22:45.420 - 22:48.880:  Forget about your worries and your strife.
22:49.940 - 22:52.420:  I mean the bare necessities.
22:52.820 - 22:55.980:  It have thought real bears would be the bare necessity.
22:55.980 - 23:02.440:  But a zoo in eastern China has been accused of using humans dressed up in bare costumes instead of the real thing.
23:02.440 - 23:08.180:  After photos showed them standing up like people, the zoo flatly denies the accusations.
23:08.780 - 23:12.800:  I asked our China media analyst Kerry Allen if she thought they were fake.
23:13.420 - 23:17.800:  I'll be honest, I first watched some video footage and I thought, yeah, that's a real bear.
23:17.940 - 23:19.840:  Nobody could have that much flexibility.
23:19.840 - 23:28.100:  But then when I saw some stills of this footage, it does look like a human being standing up.
23:28.140 - 23:34.440:  And I have to mention that this breed of bear, the Malayan sun bear, it's about four to five feet tall.
23:34.920 - 23:37.780:  So it's roughly the size of a small human anyway.
23:37.780 - 23:46.040:  And yeah, there are people who have definitely lit up Chinese social media talking about how they think it actually might be a human in a bare costume.
23:46.300 - 23:51.340:  I have to say I looked at the crease beneath the bum and it just that looks so fake.
23:51.340 - 23:53.000:  It can't be real, can it?
23:53.660 - 23:56.320:  But it's been a pretty furious reaction in China, hasn't there?
23:56.540 - 24:03.340:  It has, yes, there have been a lot of people who've been saying that, yeah, they think it is definitely somebody in a bare costume.
24:03.340 - 24:13.400:  And it has actually led to the Hangzhou Zoo issuing a response saying, no, it's not somebody in a bare costume in the summer temperatures can reach nearly 40 degrees Celsius.
24:13.400 - 24:19.700:  And if a person did wear it exactly, and if a person did wear a bare costume, they will be lying down within minutes.
24:19.700 - 24:20.960:  So they dispute this.
24:21.260 - 24:26.900:  But yeah, it definitely is the case that this bear or person in a bare costume, they do move like a human.
24:26.900 - 24:38.920:  And that has also triggered a lot of reaction on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, with people saying that they think this is an animal reacting in an abnormal and a natural way, possibly from exposure to tourists.
24:39.220 - 24:46.260:  Yeah, because the neck also looks too long, it looks like, well, like a fake head that's been pulled over the top of a human's head.
24:46.560 - 24:52.280:  Yeah, and there have been concerns in recent years due to malnutrition at Chinese zoos.
24:52.700 - 24:57.920:  As I mentioned, this is a bear that's roughly the size of a human, and it does look very small.
24:57.920 - 25:06.660:  It almost looks underweight, so that's why some people think, yeah, okay, it might be that it looks very human-like because it's not being treated well.
25:07.020 - 25:11.220:  And it has to be mentioned that this is a vulnerable species anyway, the Malayan sun bear.
25:11.540 - 25:13.840:  So it is difficult to see many of them.
25:13.840 - 25:17.840:  And there are perceptions that it might be a way of attracting people to the park.
25:17.840 - 25:22.100:  For example, it is being advertised that you can see this very rare bear.
25:22.100 - 25:29.560:  But at the same time, there are so few of these about that it's difficult to kind of compare them to humans if this is the case that it is a real bear.
25:30.000 - 25:40.900:  And I think it's the case that there are concerns for zoos, they need to make money that there might be these very kind of questionable gimmicks in place in order to attract people to see animals that might be quite rare.
25:41.420 - 25:51.920:  And the zoo's not having those animals in place, so yeah, it's definitely one that's triggered split reactions, some concerns, some humour, and yes, a lot of questions.
25:52.780 - 25:59.660:  Kerry Allen, so real or bear-faced lie would love to know what you think the video is on BBCNews.com.
26:00.340 - 26:10.240:  And staying with animals, a top-flight cricket match in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo had to be briefly haunted on Monday afternoon after a huge snake made its way onto the pitch.
26:10.740 - 26:15.380:  A video of the incident has since been widely shared on social media. Here's Tom Bailey.
26:15.820 - 26:23.440:  Whilst rain disrupting play may be a familiar headache for cricket fans across the globe, this was an altogether more unusual stoppage.
26:23.460 - 26:35.760:  The unwelcome visitors slithered into the spotlight during a tense, Lanko Premier League T20 clash between the Dambula Giants and Gull Gladiators, much to the bemusement of players and fans.
26:35.760 - 26:46.900:  The reptile was eventually chewed from the pitch by a fearless umpire, allowing play to resume before wildlife officials arrived to safely evict the creature from the stadium complex.
26:46.900 - 26:55.320:  A video of the incident has proven to hit on social media with some jokingly hailing it as a historic moment for cricket.
26:55.780 - 26:56.640:  Tom Bailey
