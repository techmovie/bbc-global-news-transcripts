00:28.580 - 00:31.980:  Betsy is held together by tape and their raccoons are being in the engine.
00:32.120 - 00:33.340:  It's a family car.
00:33.600 - 00:35.200:  Uh, there are flames on the hood.
00:35.400 - 00:36.540:  Bad custom paint job.

00:54.220 - 00:58.380:  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Saturday the 29th of July,
00:58.380 - 01:00.120:  these are our main stories.
01:00.640 - 01:03.200:  A serious legal case's mount against Donald Trump,
01:03.200 - 01:07.100:  he says not even a criminal conviction will stop his run for the presidency.
01:07.100 - 01:10.400:  Nichea's new military leader after Wednesday's coup
01:10.400 - 01:13.100:  warns other countries against intervening.
01:14.360 - 01:18.300:  I call on the partners of Nichea in the areas of technology and finance
01:18.400 - 01:21.540:  to understand our country's specific situation.
01:21.840 - 01:24.500:  And emergency services on higher alert in southern Europe
01:24.500 - 01:27.700:  despite devastating wildfires being brought under control.
01:30.020 - 01:33.040:  Also, in this podcast, a Hong Kong court strikes down
01:33.040 - 01:35.980:  a government request to ban the unofficial anthem
01:35.980 - 01:37.780:  of the pro-democracy movement.
01:38.260 - 01:40.680:  And the new research that suggests our imagination
01:40.680 - 01:43.040:  does not deteriorate with age.
01:46.120 - 01:49.040:  Donald Trump is so determined to return to the White House.
01:49.060 - 01:52.580:  He says he's even prepared to carry on campaigning from jail
01:52.580 - 01:54.820:  if he's convicted and sentenced next year.
01:55.200 - 01:57.280:  His remarks come as he and his chief rival,
01:57.280 - 01:59.060:  the Florida Governor, Ronda Santos,
01:59.460 - 02:02.940:  prepared to appear on the same platform before Republican supporters
02:03.340 - 02:06.440:  at the party's annual Lincoln dinner fundraiser.
02:06.720 - 02:09.240:  The former president is still way ahead of his rivals
02:09.240 - 02:13.120:  despite federal prosecutors on Thursday adding three more charges
02:13.540 - 02:17.000:  linked to his handling of classified documents after leaving office.
02:17.440 - 02:21.640:  Mr. Trump gave his reaction to the US website, Bright Barton News.
02:22.480 - 02:23.500:  This is harassment.
02:23.560 - 02:25.360:  This is election interference.
02:26.220 - 02:28.780:  I'm protected by the Presidential Records Act.
02:30.000 - 02:31.920:  Totally, it shouldn't even be a case.
02:32.220 - 02:33.340:  It's not a criminal case.
02:34.440 - 02:35.940:  Where's Biden with all the documents?
02:35.940 - 02:38.760:  He's got 20 times, 30 times the documents I have.
02:38.800 - 02:41.000:  And he has not made it easy for them either.
02:41.000 - 02:42.260:  They're hiding boxes.
02:42.900 - 02:45.720:  No, this is a two-tier system of injustice.
02:46.840 - 02:47.660:  And that's what we have.
02:47.700 - 02:48.700:  We have a sick country.
02:48.880 - 02:50.460:  Our country is very sick right now.
02:51.060 - 02:54.620:  We have a failing nation and it's a very sad thing to watch.
02:55.160 - 02:57.040:  In the space of six months next year,
02:57.040 - 02:59.920:  Mr. Trump could be dealing with several legal cases
03:00.340 - 03:01.740:  when campaigning is well underway.
03:01.740 - 03:04.340:  In all of them, he denies any wrongdoing.
03:04.780 - 03:05.860:  I'll start North America.
03:05.860 - 03:09.780:  Editor Sarah Smith, if there's anything that could prevent him from running again.
03:10.500 - 03:13.580:  Constitutionally and legally know that there's nothing that can stop him
03:13.580 - 03:15.980:  and politically, it doesn't seem like there is either.
03:16.060 - 03:19.040:  He says himself, he'll keep going no matter what.
03:19.660 - 03:22.100:  And the polls seem to suggest he's right to do so,
03:22.100 - 03:25.500:  because every time he has been charged with a criminal offense,
03:25.840 - 03:27.920:  his poll ratings have gone up.
03:27.920 - 03:31.480:  It defies political gravity, but it's true.
03:31.900 - 03:35.800:  He tells his supporters that he's the victim of a political witch hunt,
03:35.800 - 03:39.340:  that the Biden administration has weaponized the justice system
03:39.400 - 03:42.940:  in order to attack him because they're frightened he could beat President Biden
03:42.940 - 03:44.440:  in the presidential election.
03:44.520 - 03:47.720:  And large numbers of his supporters appear to believe this
03:48.000 - 03:52.040:  and it appears to have solidified their support for him as they believe
03:52.040 - 03:55.480:  that he is the man they need to get back into the White House in order
03:55.860 - 03:58.120:  as many of them say to counter the deep state.
03:58.800 - 04:03.400:  Even if he was convicted, and of course he denies any wrongdoing,
04:03.400 - 04:07.640:  the way the legal process works, though, it'll be way after the presidential election
04:07.640 - 04:10.100:  by the time it all appeals to finish, wouldn't it be?
04:10.500 - 04:11.200:  Almost certainly.
04:11.740 - 04:15.900:  And by that time he will of course be in charge of the justice department.
04:15.900 - 04:20.680:  So if he were to be reelected and became president of the United States once more,
04:20.680 - 04:25.440:  he could instruct his own attorney general to stop pursuing these cases.
04:25.440 - 04:29.960:  He could pardon himself for any federal offenses that he had been convicted of.
04:29.960 - 04:31.980:  No, that any president has done that.
04:31.980 - 04:36.040:  That's constitutional gray area, but he's certainly convinced he could pardon himself
04:36.120 - 04:38.040:  and many legal scholars are as well.
04:38.040 - 04:42.840:  So almost everything that happens with Donald Trump is unprecedented, isn't it?
04:42.840 - 04:46.460:  We use that word almost daily in regards to his political career.
04:46.900 - 04:49.760:  But we're moving into uncharted territory here,
04:49.760 - 04:54.380:  which we go through these criminal cases next year, where we really never have seen the like.
04:54.520 - 04:57.260:  You're in the state of Iowa for a Republican fundraiser,
04:57.260 - 05:00.860:  where all the presidential hopefuls are Mr. Trump included.
05:00.980 - 05:02.660:  Are they, is he going to speak?
05:02.920 - 05:04.520:  Yes, he'll be speaking last,
05:04.520 - 05:09.040:  as befits his status as the clear front runner in this Republican race.
05:09.100 - 05:11.720:  And there will be a dozen other candidates talking before him.
05:11.720 - 05:12.940:  They get ten minutes each.
05:13.520 - 05:17.660:  And they're speaking to Iowa and Republicans, who of course are the people in this state
05:17.660 - 05:21.420:  who first choose who they want to be their Republican nominees.
05:21.420 - 05:22.560:  So it's a very important state.
05:22.820 - 05:25.860:  And it'll be really interesting to listen to all the other candidates
05:25.860 - 05:27.660:  who've got to speak before him tonight and see,
05:27.660 - 05:31.640:  do they criticize him for these possibly criminal actions
05:31.640 - 05:36.320:  for which he's being charged and risk alienating his large numbers of supporters?
05:36.980 - 05:39.900:  Or do they support the man whom they're running against,
05:40.020 - 05:41.640:  the candidate whom they're trying to defeat?
05:41.640 - 05:44.760:  Do they give him their backing when it comes to these legal actions?
05:45.280 - 05:46.640:  Sarah Smith in Iowa.
05:47.880 - 05:48.980:  Don't interfere.
05:49.480 - 05:50.040:  That's the warning.
05:50.040 - 05:55.900:  The army in Niger is sending to foreign powers three days after it deposed the elected president in a coup.
05:56.300 - 06:00.000:  A spokesman for the army said foreign intervention could lead to chaos and death.
06:00.000 - 06:05.880:  On Friday, the leader of the coup general Abdu Raman Chiani declared himself the new ruler
06:06.200 - 06:09.340:  while President Mohammed Bazoum is still being detained.
06:09.340 - 06:13.480:  Mr Chiani read out a statement on behalf of the people now in charge,
06:13.820 - 06:16.780:  the National Council for the safeguarding of the homeland.
06:16.780 - 06:22.980:  He also called for mutual cooperation between Niger and its international partners for the good of the country.
06:23.620 - 06:25.480:  Jadoumand, Opartener, Technique of Finance.
06:25.560 - 06:28.900:  I call on the partners of Niger in the areas of technology
06:28.960 - 06:32.760:  and finance to understand our country's specific situation
06:32.760 - 06:38.080:  and to provide all the necessary support to enable it to meet the challenges.
06:38.620 - 06:42.240:  There's been international condemnation of the coup, including from the US,
06:42.240 - 06:45.400:  which said it could stop security cooperation with Niger
06:45.680 - 06:47.000:  because of the military takeover.
06:47.360 - 06:51.740:  The White House National Security spokesperson, John Kirby, had this to say.
06:52.240 - 06:53.720:  We have watched this with deep concern.
06:54.120 - 07:02.460:  We certainly condemn any effort to detain or to subvert the functioning of Niger's democratically elected government.
07:02.700 - 07:04.060:  We're still gathering facts here.
07:04.320 - 07:10.540:  Advise all Americans in Niger to be careful about where they are and what they're doing.
07:10.900 - 07:14.960:  Our correspondent Chris Iwaka is monitoring developments from neighboring Nigeria.
07:15.920 - 07:19.640:  We don't know the whereabouts of President Bazoum who's been ousted.
07:20.020 - 07:22.800:  There are indications he's still been detained in the presidential palace
07:23.000 - 07:26.980:  and the people are suggesting that he would be forced to sign a resignation letter
07:26.980 - 07:30.640:  that would effectively hand over the country to the hands of the military.
07:30.900 - 07:33.240:  What do we know about General Tchiani?
07:33.480 - 07:37.660:  Can we make any guesses to what direction he's likely to want to take the country in?
07:37.820 - 07:42.460:  General Rahman Chani was appointed 2015 by former President Yusufu
07:42.620 - 07:46.960:  and when President Muhammad Bazoum won an election
07:47.220 - 07:49.600:  and was about to be sworn in two years ago,
07:49.600 - 07:54.300:  there was an attempted coup and it was General Rahman who came to the rescue.
07:54.640 - 07:59.260:  Now that he is taking over one inkling that many people are getting from his address
07:59.600 - 08:04.560:  was that he felt that President Bazoum was not really collaborating with neighbors
08:04.560 - 08:06.620:  that were fighting jihadist extremism.
08:06.920 - 08:09.500:  They are Mali and of course Takina Faso.
08:09.720 - 08:12.720:  And these are two countries that are under military rule
08:12.820 - 08:17.620:  and they have also civilized with the West and have created links with Russia.
08:17.940 - 08:20.900:  On Thursday hundreds of people came out to demonstrate
08:20.900 - 08:25.000:  to show their support for the military takeover of government
08:25.000 - 08:29.040:  and some of them chanting anti-France, anti-Western slogans
08:29.040 - 08:32.640:  and calling for intervention of Russia.
08:32.940 - 08:36.560:  That would leave the West with very few friends in that part of Africa.
08:36.820 - 08:42.120:  Clearly yes and many people are wondering why especially former French colonies
08:42.120 - 08:46.220:  are cutin to West Russia rather than the West.
08:46.380 - 08:48.860:  What role do uranium deposits play?
08:49.360 - 08:55.100:  Niger is a landlocked country and rich in uranium but it's one of the poorest in the world.
08:55.340 - 09:00.780:  Many people see that country as a very big opportunity where they can mate this uranium
09:00.780 - 09:04.000:  and that's why countries like Russia would be interested
09:04.480 - 09:08.800:  and there are also indications that illegal mining of these minerals is ongoing
09:08.800 - 09:12.740:  which is the reason that has led the fight against insurgency
09:12.740 - 09:14.340:  to fester for so long.
09:14.340 - 09:16.200:  Chris Iwaka in Nigeria.
09:16.720 - 09:22.320:  Samark Lokok was permanent secretary at the department for international development in the UK
09:22.800 - 09:27.080:  and served as under secretary general for humanitarian affairs at the United Nations.
09:27.620 - 09:31.500:  Ed Sturton asked him why the coup happened and what the plot is want.
09:32.340 - 09:36.340:  The government has struggled to do enough to provide good quality services
09:36.380 - 09:39.840:  and to grow the economy and improve people's lives in Niger.
09:40.360 - 09:43.020:  Partly because it has enough help especially from the West.
09:43.260 - 09:47.240:  But what needs to happen is a combination of much more effective military development,
09:47.240 - 09:51.200:  humanitarian support from Western countries, enabling fragile,
09:51.200 - 09:56.360:  you know better intention governments in the region to survive, deal with conflict,
09:56.360 - 10:00.260:  cope with climate change better and find a better way forward for all their populations.
10:00.620 - 10:02.580:  But what you describe is a double whammy isn't it?
10:02.580 - 10:04.500:  Two things that we don't like happening.
10:04.500 - 10:07.500:  One being risk of the spread of Islamic extremism
10:07.920 - 10:11.860:  and the other being Wagner, the Russian group, penetrating Africa more deeply than ever.
10:12.020 - 10:16.280:  The origin is multiple problems that haven't been gripped effectively.
10:16.280 - 10:20.020:  The climate is changing rapidly in this part of Africa.
10:20.680 - 10:26.680:  Traditional livelihoods are decreasingly viable, either nomadic livestock or agriculture
10:26.760 - 10:28.560:  because the rainfall is too variable.
10:29.100 - 10:31.400:  That means there's increasing competition for resources.
10:31.860 - 10:36.760:  That creates grievances which create conflict into which come the Islamic extremists.
10:36.880 - 10:38.520:  Government struggle to cope with that.
10:38.520 - 10:40.120:  They look for military help from elsewhere.
10:41.060 - 10:46.320:  Europe through the French provided it for a while but got disenchanted with doing so,
10:46.320 - 10:49.640:  failed to stay the cause and incomes, Russia and Wagner.
10:49.840 - 10:55.640:  Do you hold the French in particular who, after all with the colonial masters of the place once upon a time,
10:55.640 - 10:59.120:  do you hold them particularly responsible for the failures that you describe?
10:59.560 - 11:06.040:  I think the basic problem is that the West collectively hasn't put enough in combination of effort in it.
11:06.040 - 11:09.540:  I think it was probably unrealistic to expect the French on their own to do it.
11:09.700 - 11:15.660:  A crucial thing that's been a big mistake is not providing enough economic developmental support
11:15.840 - 11:19.020:  so that the lives of ordinary people in this region has improved
11:19.140 - 11:22.540:  and have a bit more confidence in their local government. That's been a big, big mistake.
11:23.120 - 11:24.140:  Some mark low cog.
11:25.280 - 11:28.700:  Countries around the Mediterranean are counting the cost of a week of fires
11:28.700 - 11:30.020:  filled by high temperatures.
11:30.300 - 11:35.580:  In Greece emergency services have tried to prevent new flare-ups in the central area of Magnesia.
11:35.880 - 11:40.800:  A security zone has been set up around an air force base near the town of Nia and Chilos
11:41.060 - 11:45.760:  after wildfires triggered powerful explosions at an ammunition depot on Thursday.
11:46.260 - 11:50.440:  Our correspondent Bethany Bell is in the island of Rhodes and sent this update.
11:51.300 - 11:54.000:  Temperatures have dropped somewhat here in Greece
11:54.480 - 11:58.800:  and many of the fires that have ravaged this country over the past couple of weeks
11:58.820 - 12:03.960:  have abated but firefighters here are still on high alert
12:04.660 - 12:10.780:  because much of the ground where some of these fires were burning is still smoldering
12:11.200 - 12:16.920:  and their fears that small embers could be blown up in the wind and cause more flare-ups.
12:16.920 - 12:22.260:  We've heard from Greece's Prime Minister say that the country must do more
12:22.260 - 12:27.980:  to try to improve Greece's firefighting and fire prevention measures
12:28.480 - 12:33.920:  and also to pay tribute as well to all of the firefighters who have been out there
12:34.220 - 12:38.000:  in extremely difficult conditions fighting these fires.
12:38.360 - 12:42.880:  We also had today the funeral of one of the two firefighting pilots
12:43.440 - 12:48.980:  who died earlier this week and also the funeral of a colleague of his took place yesterday.
12:49.440 - 12:50.860:  Bethany Bell in Rhodes.
12:51.540 - 12:56.300:  In Tunisia, civil defence forces have said that wildfires which spread across five provinces
12:56.300 - 13:00.800:  in the past few days have now been brought under control a thousand hectares of forest
13:00.860 - 13:06.540:  and the northwestern province of Genduba have been destroyed mainly in the village of Tabarka
13:06.540 - 13:09.680:  from where our reporter Basan Boneni sent this report.
13:11.780 - 13:18.020:  Adel Selmi observes the damage as wildfires rage near Tabarka.
13:20.400 - 13:24.660:  The fire was a little far but quickly we felt that the flames were getting closer.
13:25.740 - 13:28.420:  Selmi owned an eco-friendly restaurant.
13:28.420 - 13:34.300:  He could barely recognise it when he returned the following morning.
13:36.180 - 13:37.820:  The traditional oven burned out.
13:38.140 - 13:41.660:  This kitchen was used for breakfast and all the equipment was burned.
13:46.120 - 13:47.600:  Munya was less lucky.
13:48.520 - 13:50.600:  Her farm has been cruelly damaged.
13:51.240 - 13:52.900:  It was a nightmare, she says.
13:57.220 - 13:58.560:  Could you take a look at this?
13:59.300 - 14:01.580:  We've lost everything. We went bankrupt.
14:03.060 - 14:07.560:  Those were too close. She miraculously escaped the fire.
14:08.300 - 14:10.680:  Now she feels more blazes to come.
14:11.240 - 14:12.400:  Do you still feel safe?
14:13.800 - 14:18.020:  Now even if the house burns out, I will stay. I have no option.
14:18.240 - 14:21.580:  Residents in Tabarka and its outskirts are in shock.
14:22.080 - 14:26.240:  Their losses are incommensurable to any other time.
14:27.060 - 14:29.600:  This is a sad landscape.
14:31.180 - 14:38.080:  Just a tiny part of Tabarka's forests has been raised to the ground.
14:38.080 - 14:41.460:  Nothing here has survived to the wildfires.
14:42.600 - 14:45.880:  I can still see the smoke and smell it.
14:46.500 - 14:50.040:  And that's the worst scenario for Tunisian firefighters.
14:50.980 - 14:55.820:  The Tunisian Civil Defence Forces work on opening forest roots
14:56.660 - 15:01.660:  since the rough terrain has made access to some fires almost impossible.
15:02.900 - 15:07.460:  Meanwhile, Tunisian helicopters and aircraft dispatched from Spain
15:08.020 - 15:09.820:  struggle to put out the flames.
15:10.840 - 15:17.780:  It is a test for the Tunisian authorities to assess their readiness to address such disasters.
15:19.560 - 15:23.340:  In the last three years, fires have multiplied, especially in the summer.
15:23.980 - 15:26.900:  We have operational plans and preemptive preparations.
15:27.640 - 15:30.760:  And this, of course, requires immense potential.
15:32.060 - 15:34.800:  That report by Basambu Nani in Tunisia.
15:35.760 - 15:40.560:  A British-built weather monitoring spacecraft has been deliberately crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
15:40.560 - 15:42.320:  in a first-of-its-kind mission.
15:42.760 - 15:48.320:  AOS satellite has provided valuable data to weather centres across Europe since 2018.
15:48.840 - 15:53.960:  Simulator Kelly is Director of Earth Observation Programs at the European Space Agency,
15:53.960 - 15:55.520:  which has overseen the project.
15:56.120 - 16:01.780:  She began by explaining to Martha Carney why AOS was nicknamed the Impossible Satellite.
16:02.380 - 16:05.960:  The AOS, which is the science mission of the European Space Agency,
16:05.960 - 16:09.720:  was called the Impossible mission because it had quite a few challenges
16:09.720 - 16:12.920:  in terms of technology development, in terms of first.
16:13.000 - 16:17.020:  In fact, it's the first ever lighter in space that has flown.
16:17.720 - 16:21.920:  And it's a mission that basically has been extremely challenging in the building,
16:21.920 - 16:25.680:  but also extremely successful in the results, because it's provided
16:26.340 - 16:28.340:  profiles of Earth, windowed on a global scale.
16:28.340 - 16:31.420:  It was launched in 2018, was supposed to live three years,
16:31.420 - 16:36.120:  and we're now in 2023, and it's gone well beyond its initial lifetime.
16:36.120 - 16:37.940:  So it's a real success story.
16:38.440 - 16:43.040:  What exactly was it able to do, and what was it able to add to weather forecasting?
16:43.320 - 16:46.440:  Unfortunately, AOS was able to improve weather forecasting.
16:46.440 - 16:49.860:  In fact, it's been used worldwide by meteorological services,
16:50.300 - 16:54.360:  including European Center for Medium Weather forecast to improve the weather forecast.
16:54.960 - 16:59.900:  It looks also at plumes, for example, in the case of volcano eruption,
16:59.940 - 17:03.440:  and it was extremely essential to support weather forecast
17:03.440 - 17:07.160:  when planes were grounded, for example, during the COVID period.
17:07.500 - 17:12.880:  And also, it was able to help, wasn't it, when volcanic ash was traveling in the high atmosphere?
17:13.220 - 17:16.820:  Exactly. It was recently used during the Hongatonga eruption,
17:17.400 - 17:21.020:  where we had through-else the possibility to track the plumes.
17:21.800 - 17:24.200:  So beyond, it's, I would say, science value.
17:24.200 - 17:28.120:  This mission, it's been extremely relevant for the economic benefits,
17:28.120 - 17:32.340:  because of course, these measurements, which are used widely to support,
17:32.340 - 17:36.880:  for example, the transport sector, in these cases, of eruptions of volcanoes.
17:37.480 - 17:39.820:  Seminate Kelly speaking to Martha Carney.
17:40.740 - 17:43.980:  A body found on a glacier close to the Matterhorn in Switzerland
17:43.980 - 17:46.900:  has been identified as that of a German climber
17:46.900 - 17:48.900:  who went missing more than three decades ago.
17:49.240 - 17:52.040:  The discovery is the latest in a number of long-held secrets
17:52.040 - 17:54.980:  that the Alpine glaciers, now rapidly shrinking,
17:54.980 - 17:56.800:  due to climate change, have revealed
17:57.280 - 17:59.540:  imaging folks reports from burn in Switzerland.
18:00.460 - 18:03.740:  The body of the German climber, missing since 1986,
18:04.380 - 18:07.940:  was found by hikers who saw a boot emerging from the ice.
18:08.700 - 18:10.900:  DNA analysis confirmed his identity.
18:10.900 - 18:14.880:  The Alps are especially sensitive to climate change.
18:14.880 - 18:18.860:  Switzerland's glaciers have lost more than half their volume
18:19.260 - 18:20.480:  in less than a century.
18:21.120 - 18:25.520:  Last year, the wreck of a plane which crashed in the 1960s emerged.
18:25.520 - 18:29.500:  In 2013, a French man hiking on Mont Blanc,
18:29.860 - 18:32.940:  found a box of rubies, sapphires and emeralds,
18:33.360 - 18:36.700:  missing from an air-India flight that crashed in 1966.
18:38.020 - 18:40.760:  But the melting ice reveals not just the past,
18:41.120 - 18:42.560:  it will affect our future.
18:43.100 - 18:46.180:  Alpine glaciers are key to Europe's environment.
18:46.280 - 18:50.740:  The winter snow they store provides fresh water in summer.
18:50.740 - 18:54.760:  Climate scientists say the glaciers are melting faster
18:54.760 - 18:56.240:  than their worst predictions.
18:56.920 - 18:59.440:  By the end of this century, they could be gone.
19:00.140 - 19:01.940:  Imogen folks in Switzerland.
19:05.140 - 19:07.600:  Still to come on the Global News Podcast,
19:07.600 - 19:10.460:  is there such a thing as world music?
19:11.100 - 19:13.760:  I see world music just being from the world.
19:14.040 - 19:17.840:  However, you would say an artist from Chile coming here will be world music.
19:17.840 - 19:20.720:  When we do a festival in Chile, music coming from the UK
19:20.720 - 19:22.580:  to then might be seen as world music.
19:31.200 - 19:35.740:  There were two explosions in the eastern Ukrainian city of Deneepro on Friday.
19:36.080 - 19:38.820:  Two buildings, including a residential tower block, were hit.
19:39.240 - 19:42.240:  From Deneepro, here's our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel.
19:42.940 - 19:46.460:  Two loud explosions were heard right across the city of Deneepro
19:46.740 - 19:49.240:  at around 8.30 local time this evening.
19:50.140 - 19:53.200:  Air raid sirens wailed, but only after the impact.
19:54.080 - 19:56.200:  The strikes occurred in the centre of the city,
19:56.680 - 19:58.660:  close to busy restaurants and bars.
19:59.620 - 20:02.740:  The Russian missiles had a government security service building,
20:03.280 - 20:05.120:  likely the intended target,
20:05.820 - 20:08.900:  but also a large residential tower block nearby.
20:09.920 - 20:12.080:  A section of the apartment block was damaged.
20:12.820 - 20:16.420:  Glass, steel and concrete were strewn across the streets below.
20:17.400 - 20:21.560:  Smoke was still billowing from the area as the emergency services arrived.
20:22.540 - 20:24.160:  They've been searching both buildings,
20:25.040 - 20:28.000:  while several people have been injured so far
20:28.400 - 20:30.320:  there are no reports of any fatalities.
20:31.100 - 20:31.820:  Jonathan Biel.
20:32.380 - 20:33.880:  We turn to Cambodia now,
20:33.880 - 20:36.160:  which is seeing the emergence of a ruling dynasty.
20:36.440 - 20:38.200:  On Thursday, Prime Minister Hun Sen,
20:38.200 - 20:40.280:  one of the world's longest-serving leaders,
20:40.720 - 20:43.240:  announced he'll resign and hand over to his son.
20:43.620 - 20:46.640:  The move comes shortly after he won all seats in an election
20:46.640 - 20:49.560:  that saw no political opponents represented.
20:50.080 - 20:55.720:  For reaction, Andrew Peach spoke to the prominent Cambodian opposition leader, Sam Rainsy.
20:56.560 - 21:00.320:  Last Sunday's election was a fake election
21:00.580 - 21:04.660:  with no opposition party taking part.
21:04.680 - 21:14.340:  Mr. Hun Sen wants to use this fake election as a base to transfer power to his son.
21:15.160 - 21:18.640:  But since the election is illegitimate,
21:18.640 - 21:22.260:  the transfer of power is also illegitimate.
21:22.520 - 21:26.180:  So the Cambodian people will not accept
21:26.180 - 21:33.040:  and the international community also has reject this illegitimate election.
21:33.180 - 21:40.140:  So with no opposition, Cambodia now can be considered as a dictatorship
21:41.100 - 21:43.680:  with no support from the international community.
21:43.860 - 21:46.800:  I mean, Hun Sen has been in charge for nearly four decades.
21:47.460 - 21:50.000:  He's retaining the leadership of the party, actually.
21:50.840 - 21:53.100:  Does that make his son just some kind of puppet?
21:53.100 - 21:55.480:  Is it basically still Hun Sen in charge?
21:56.360 - 21:59.820:  Yes, as long as Hun Sen is alive,
22:00.240 - 22:05.040:  he will continue to pull the strings behind the curtain.
22:05.440 - 22:12.600:  His son has no authority, no experience, no charisma to lead the country.
22:12.900 - 22:15.880:  Hun Sen is still manipulating everything.
22:16.100 - 22:19.400:  You talked about people in Cambodia not accepting the outcome.
22:19.400 - 22:20.320:  What might they do?
22:20.720 - 22:26.000:  We are waiting for any opportunity to protest against
22:26.060 - 22:31.800:  and we are encouraged by the fact that within the ruling party,
22:32.520 - 22:36.560:  there are dignitaries who are not happened
22:36.560 - 22:42.740:  because they have to step down when Hun Sen's son takes up his position.
22:43.160 - 22:45.300:  So we expect instability
22:45.800 - 22:49.120:  because the popular resistance on the one hand
22:49.120 - 22:54.080:  and the internal division within the ruling party on the other hand.
22:54.340 - 22:57.360:  Do you think there's any possibility of some measure of reform
22:57.360 - 23:01.260:  with the country being run by someone in his forces
23:02.060 - 23:03.700:  rather than someone in his 70s?
23:04.120 - 23:10.800:  We have in mind the experience of Syria about 20 years ago
23:10.800 - 23:19.040:  when dictator Afer al-Assad was replaced by his more educated son,
23:19.800 - 23:22.420:  some people expected an improvement.
23:22.420 - 23:25.440:  But in fact, the son is worse.
23:26.020 - 23:28.720:  It is not a matter of persons.
23:29.360 - 23:31.280:  It is a matter of a system.
23:31.500 - 23:34.880:  As long as the system remains the same,
23:34.880 - 23:38.120:  there will be no improvement whatsoever.
23:38.940 - 23:41.020:  Sam Renzi speaking to Andrew Peach.
23:42.440 - 23:44.820:  A court in Hong Kong has rejected a request
23:44.940 - 23:48.000:  from the government to ban a popular pro-democracy song
23:48.000 - 23:50.300:  that has become the movement's unofficial anthem.
23:50.760 - 23:52.300:  The government applied for the injunction.
23:52.300 - 23:55.380:  After the song, Glory to Hong Kong was mistakenly played
23:55.660 - 23:57.720:  at several international sporting events,
23:58.040 - 23:59.300:  more from Electra Nasmith.
24:00.240 - 24:02.820:  Glory to Hong Kong was widely played
24:02.820 - 24:07.080:  during the Territory's month-long pro-democracy protest in 2019.
24:07.080 - 24:09.720:  But since the imposition of China's national security law,
24:09.840 - 24:12.040:  the song's been deemed unlawful.
24:12.120 - 24:13.780:  But that hasn't managed to suppress it,
24:13.780 - 24:14.660:  even at international sporting events.
24:15.060 - 24:20.060:  The authorities have been trying to get rid of the song online for months.
24:21.220 - 24:22.040:  The court case will be held in March 2020.
24:23.140 - 24:24.760:  But since the imposition of China's national security law,
24:25.340 - 24:26.940:  the song's been deemed unlawful.
24:26.940 - 24:28.660:  But that hasn't managed to suppress it,
24:28.840 - 24:31.320:  the court case was a continuation of that process.
24:31.840 - 24:32.740:  But they've failed.
24:33.200 - 24:34.780:  The judge ruled that granting the ban
24:34.820 - 24:37.020:  can have a chilling effect on freedom of speech,
24:37.020 - 24:39.340:  a decision welcomed by rights groups.
24:39.780 - 24:40.760:  Electra Nasmith.
24:41.640 - 24:44.480:  You research suggests that the human imagination
24:44.480 - 24:47.840:  does not deteriorate with age in the way that we might have assumed.
24:47.840 - 24:50.040:  It was carried out on behalf of English heritage,
24:50.040 - 24:54.600:  an organisation that runs tourist sites like castles and monuments in the UK.
24:55.180 - 24:59.500:  Angela Nehout is professor of psychology at the University of Kent
24:59.780 - 25:00.580:  and led the study.
25:00.920 - 25:03.580:  She told Rebecca Kesby more about the findings.
25:04.400 - 25:06.860:  This research is kind of contributing to understanding
25:06.860 - 25:09.360:  really what happens between early childhood,
25:09.360 - 25:12.480:  so reception year and later adulthood,
25:12.480 - 25:15.640:  in terms of the possibilities individuals imagine.
25:15.800 - 25:18.900:  There's this popular conception that children are imaginative
25:19.040 - 25:19.980:  and adults aren't.
25:20.240 - 25:22.860:  So what we wanted to do was take a step back
25:23.040 - 25:25.600:  and look at a wide lens across the age span to see
25:25.620 - 25:29.360:  when individuals are in a historical context like Dover Castle,
25:30.040 - 25:31.640:  what kind of possibilities they imagine
25:31.640 - 25:34.140:  when they're presented with historical objects.
25:34.520 - 25:37.820:  So we gave them a series of different Roman replica objects
25:38.440 - 25:39.420:  and simply asked them,
25:39.780 - 25:42.140:  how do you imagine people could have used this a long time ago?
25:42.140 - 25:46.640:  Older adults came up with more creative or original possibilities
25:46.640 - 25:48.280:  than younger adults and children.
25:48.300 - 25:51.680:  And they also came up with more detailed answers,
25:51.940 - 25:53.620:  whereas one person might just say,
25:53.740 - 25:56.360:  oh, I could see this being a paperweight.
25:56.780 - 25:59.360:  A more detailed answer might give a more colorful description
25:59.400 - 26:01.700:  around how an individual might have used that.
26:02.020 - 26:04.980:  So the imagination may even improve with age?
26:05.340 - 26:05.580:  Yes.
26:05.580 - 26:09.480:  So that experience that individuals acquire over the years
26:10.340 - 26:13.040:  can be used to be like recombined in new ways
26:13.040 - 26:15.260:  to come up with imaginary possibilities.
26:15.820 - 26:18.980:  Does this show us that actually adults need to play more
26:19.200 - 26:22.840:  and do we need to be supported and encouraged to play?
26:23.200 - 26:24.120:  Yeah, I think you're right.
26:24.220 - 26:27.680:  We don't get a lot of time to escape into imaginary worlds,
26:27.680 - 26:30.060:  whereas in childhood, the job is really just to play.
26:30.500 - 26:32.780:  So I think the opportunities like English Heritage
26:32.780 - 26:35.760:  are presenting for us as adults to dress up
26:35.760 - 26:37.100:  and escape into these other worlds
26:37.100 - 26:40.940:  is really a great opportunity to let our imaginations run wild.
26:41.740 - 26:44.480:  We do use our imaginations a lot on a day-to-day basis
26:45.000 - 26:46.420:  but really in more mundane ways.
26:46.420 - 26:48.440:  So thinking about, OK, what am I going to do tomorrow?
26:49.100 - 26:50.440:  What's the best way for me to get home?
26:51.260 - 26:53.480:  Maybe replaying is an event that happened yesterday
26:53.480 - 26:55.380:  that kind of bothered you and you could think about
26:55.500 - 26:56.660:  how it could have happened differently.
26:56.700 - 26:58.740:  That's an ability called counterfactual thinking.
26:59.240 - 27:00.820:  So these are all imaginative processes
27:00.820 - 27:03.500:  but they deal with more mundane day-to-day things.
27:03.900 - 27:05.580:  Professor Angela Nehout.
27:06.620 - 27:09.680:  One of the first and biggest world music festivals,
27:10.080 - 27:12.700:  WOMAD is taking place at the moment at Charlton Park
27:12.700 - 27:14.260:  in Southwest England.
27:14.260 - 27:16.200:  The BBC's Martin Venard is there.
27:16.580 - 27:19.640:  There's been trying to find out exactly what world music is
27:20.180 - 27:21.820:  and whether the term is still relevant.
27:23.200 - 27:26.960:  This is WOMAD, the world of music, arts and dance festival
27:26.960 - 27:30.620:  in the south of England and thousands of people are here
27:30.980 - 27:32.760:  watching the American hip-hop group,
27:33.140 - 27:36.320:  the jungle brothers performing in a circus big top.
27:37.100 - 27:40.540:  Let's ask some of those people what they think world music is.
27:41.460 - 27:44.480:  It's stuff that they don't play on the mainstream right now.
27:44.700 - 27:48.240:  Well, music is that feeling of the different cultures
27:48.880 - 27:50.940:  takes me to different places the whole time.
27:56.200 - 28:02.320:  This is Africa baby band from a hip-hop group called jungle brothers.
28:02.960 - 28:05.160:  What is world music in your view?
28:05.380 - 28:08.020:  Technical level, arts of percussion,
28:08.940 - 28:10.740:  brass, celebratory.
28:11.480 - 28:13.740:  It brings not just the music, but it brings the culture
28:13.740 - 28:16.060:  and the message of the people who are not playing.
28:16.380 - 28:18.700:  Is there anything that couldn't be world music?
28:18.880 - 28:21.620:  Nothing against pop music, but there is a structure there
28:22.100 - 28:24.840:  for making things catchy, mass market.
28:25.420 - 28:27.060:  I don't think of world music as that.
28:35.080 - 28:37.880:  Hello, I'm Kate Rosby and I'm a folk singer from England.
28:38.060 - 28:41.920:  And how would you take to being described as a world musician?
28:42.600 - 28:44.560:  Oh, I would very much like that.
28:44.880 - 28:45.820:  I go around the world.
28:46.340 - 28:51.020:  I mainly sing old traditional songs from the British Isles.
28:51.220 - 28:52.780:  I write my own songs as well.
28:53.260 - 28:56.040:  But my first love is those really old ballads and old songs.
28:56.220 - 28:58.360:  And those songs in themselves travelled.
28:58.980 - 29:00.300:  It might have been written in Ireland.
29:00.480 - 29:04.700:  And then it went to England and then over to Canada and back again.
29:04.920 - 29:07.840:  Would western pop and rock music?
29:07.900 - 29:09.140:  Could that be world music?
29:09.440 - 29:12.780:  I think there's always little elements that have come from around the world in there.
29:12.900 - 29:15.540:  So I would say so and pop travels, doesn't it?
29:19.020 - 29:21.960:  So those were the views of two of the artists performing at Walmart.
29:22.460 - 29:26.620:  What do those people who work behind the scenes in the music industry think?
29:27.100 - 29:32.060:  We're backstage now at the Walmart festival and with Paula Henderson.
29:32.560 - 29:35.440:  I'm the head programmer for the festival, not only here,
29:35.500 - 29:37.880:  but also the other events that we do around the world.
29:38.500 - 29:41.140:  I see world music just being from the world.
29:41.640 - 29:45.580:  However, you would say analysis from Chile coming here will be world music.
29:45.580 - 29:50.660:  When we do a festival in Chile, music coming from the UK to then might be seen as world music.
29:50.880 - 29:54.880:  So is there any artist that wouldn't qualify as a world musician?
29:55.160 - 29:58.920:  I probably would avoid trash metal, but that's my own personal choice.
30:05.400 - 30:09.860:  There are, of course, many artists from around the world performing during the four-day festival.
30:10.540 - 30:12.660:  While wandering around listening to some of them,
30:12.980 - 30:17.040:  a by chance came across Amanda Jones from real-world records.
30:17.720 - 30:19.680:  Who tells me she was in a meeting,
30:19.680 - 30:25.360:  but does not saw record company representatives in a London pub in the mid-1980s,
30:25.580 - 30:32.040:  which came up with the term world music to describe the non-mainstream international artists,
30:32.060 - 30:35.100:  whose records they were trying to get into the shops.
30:35.540 - 30:38.340:  I could encompass the global beat sky over there,
30:38.340 - 30:41.180:  and it could encompass my beautiful Indian classical music record.
30:41.480 - 30:44.740:  And I was there with the team of people I worked with at World Mad at the time,
30:44.800 - 30:46.500:  so Van Womad records at the time.
30:46.960 - 30:50.300:  And we had quite a strong influence on the idea of world music.
30:50.740 - 30:55.140:  Do you feel proud or guilty now having come up with the term world music?
30:55.620 - 30:56.040:  Both.
30:57.420 - 30:59.380:  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of redundant, isn't it?
30:59.960 - 31:02.280:  And maybe that's a great thing. We don't need any more.
31:04.720 - 31:08.040:  And that was Amanda Jones of real-world records,
31:08.140 - 31:10.200:  ending that report by Martin Vanart.
31:12.300 - 31:14.060:  And that's all from us for now,
31:14.060 - 31:18.260:  but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast at this time tomorrow.
