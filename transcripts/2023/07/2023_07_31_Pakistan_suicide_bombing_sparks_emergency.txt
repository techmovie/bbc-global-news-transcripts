00:50.180 - 00:56.640:  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:59.280 - 01:04.660:  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this at 13 hours GMT on Monday the 31st of July.
01:05.380 - 01:10.480:  A day after a suicide bombing on a rally in northeast Pakistan, we ask who might have carried it out.
01:11.240 - 01:15.740:  Our defence correspondent goes on patrol with Ukrainian snipers near Bachmout.
01:16.460 - 01:21.320:  And we hear from a member of China's We Get Community who says he was pressured into being a spy
01:21.320 - 01:29.840:  for the communist authorities. Also in the podcast, he considers himself a real boxer and is
01:29.840 - 01:36.380:  himself very disdainful of fights like this against YouTubers. Why professional fighter Tommy Fury
01:36.380 - 01:39.200:  is taking on another social media star.
01:44.260 - 01:49.040:  The suicide bombing at a political rally in northwest Pakistan on Sunday was just the latest in
01:49.040 - 01:55.720:  a series of attacks in the former tribal lands bordering Afghanistan. Analysts say militants
01:55.720 - 02:01.420:  there have become increasingly bold since the Afghan Taliban regained power in Kabul two years ago.
02:02.100 - 02:07.820:  However, the Pakistani Taliban have tended to target security forces and not political events
02:07.820 - 02:12.260:  like Sunday's rally, which was held by an Islamist party in the governing coalition.
02:13.000 - 02:18.260:  Officials are blaming local fighters linked to IS, who have attacked the party before.
02:19.140 - 02:23.620:  Shandana Ghulza Khan is an opposition politician in Kaiba Paktunkwa province.
02:24.520 - 02:30.880:  This is nearly the 10th or 12th, perhaps, attack in my province. I come from KPK and
02:30.880 - 02:35.540:  how come whoever these terrorists are and whoever is funding them or wherever they come from,
02:35.540 - 02:41.880:  the ideology seems to be attacking officers of the state whose job it is to protect our lives.
02:42.240 - 02:46.140:  Yesterday, it was in a political gathering. That sends a very similar message to those that came
02:46.140 - 02:53.200:  above that we will do anything to disrupt the life of normal Pakistanis in one particular province.
02:53.900 - 02:58.640:  The bomb, which is now known to have contained approximately 10 kilograms of explosives,
02:58.640 - 03:04.800:  killed at least 45 people with 60 more in hospital. I heard more about the attack from our
03:04.800 - 03:10.160:  correspondent in Islamabad, Carrie Davis. Oli, we've been speaking to people who were there when
03:10.160 - 03:16.060:  the explosion happened and were then closely came very soon afterwards to the scene. We spoke
03:16.060 - 03:20.300:  to one of the rallies organizers who was on stage when this happened. He describes the moment
03:20.300 - 03:24.020:  that they were talking amongst themselves while the political speeches were going on,
03:24.880 - 03:28.360:  trying to work out what they were going to move to next when suddenly the explosion happened.
03:28.360 - 03:33.640:  He said, initially, he hadn't realised what it was. He thought maybe the generators malfunctioned,
03:34.000 - 03:38.820:  that the sound system was malfunctioning and then very quickly realised it was something far more
03:38.820 - 03:44.980:  violent. He said that in the aftermath there was chaos, people running around. He described it as
03:44.980 - 03:52.100:  being like doomsday with bodies and that then when the ambulances did arrive to take people
03:52.540 - 03:57.620:  to hospital, that there weren't enough. Of course, over the last few hours, we've continued to
03:57.620 - 04:03.540:  hear new death tolls. We also do know that the police are still trying to identify some of those
04:03.780 - 04:07.480:  dead. They are doing that through, trying to identify them through their clothes, through their
04:07.480 - 04:13.640:  shoes. This is obviously a very severe blast and the fact that this is a political rally that was
04:13.640 - 04:19.500:  targeted in the build up to a much anticipated general election expected to happen later this year,
04:19.980 - 04:25.280:  that is of course concerning people because we are not yet even in the main campaigning period.
04:25.280 - 04:30.460:  We don't have a set date for the general election and yet even as people are starting to ramp up
04:30.460 - 04:37.520:  and prepare for this, we've seen this attack. We have seen an increase in violence in parts of
04:37.520 - 04:44.120:  Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul but the Pakistani
04:44.460 - 04:52.000:  Taliban seem to be distancing themselves from this attack. Can we tell from the target who might
04:52.000 - 04:57.800:  have carried it out? Yes, a large amount of the increase in the attacks that we've seen across
04:57.800 - 05:03.480:  the country. Yes, that they have been linked to the Pakistani Taliban and as you say, factions
05:03.540 - 05:09.240:  of the Pakistani Taliban have distanced themselves from this attack, some have even condoned it as
05:09.240 - 05:15.000:  well. We are getting some other official reports coming through. Our officials have refuted the report
05:15.000 - 05:20.080:  that so-called Islamic State is responsible for yesterday's attack. In the wording that we've
05:20.080 - 05:25.020:  been given, they've said that there are some indications of the involvement of a local chapter with
05:25.020 - 05:30.260:  links to so-called Islamic State. Now that might sound contradictory but of course bear in mind that
05:30.260 - 05:35.840:  these are not necessarily whole bodies all of the time with someone at the top giving directions
05:35.880 - 05:40.720:  further down quite often. These can be much smaller factions, much smaller groups that might operate
05:40.720 - 05:46.340:  independently and so that is why it's quite complicated to try to work out exactly who is involved
05:46.340 - 05:50.600:  and at this point, still no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
05:51.180 - 05:57.580:  Karidavis in Pakistan. Well, the return of the Taliban to power over in Afghanistan has created
05:57.580 - 06:02.700:  dilemma for Western countries. On the one hand, they don't want to make life any harder for the
06:02.700 - 06:07.860:  millions of Afghans struggling with poverty. But they also don't want to support a government which
06:07.860 - 06:13.260:  imposes ever tighter restrictions on women. US officials are currently meeting representatives
06:13.260 - 06:20.120:  of the Afghan Taliban in Qatar, discussing humanitarian support, women's rights and the Taliban's
06:20.120 - 06:25.480:  demands to end sanctions. Our correspondent, Samir Hashmi, is following the negotiations.
06:26.300 - 06:30.760:  These are rare talks between the United States and Taliban. They haven't had many
06:31.480 - 06:36.100:  since the United States pulled out from Afghanistan in 2021. Now, some of the issues that will
06:36.100 - 06:42.660:  dominate the agenda would be the economic stabilization, the treatment of dignified treatment
06:42.660 - 06:49.120:  of Afghans, specifically women and girls who have suffered the most since Taliban took over.
06:49.500 - 06:53.540:  Other issues that are expected to be discussed during the meeting would include clamping down
06:53.740 - 06:59.880:  narcotic production and also security issues related to the country. If you look at the United
06:59.880 - 07:05.240:  States delegation that's gone to all these talks, it also includes Rina Amiri, who is the US
07:05.240 - 07:10.660:  special envoy for Afghan women and girls. So clearly, the US wants to discuss this in detail,
07:11.380 - 07:15.180:  whether they'll be able to push the Taliban to reverse some of the decisions including
07:15.180 - 07:21.480:  banning women from attending university or secondary school and also banning women from working
07:21.480 - 07:25.780:  at most places. In fact, just last week, they also shut down beauty parlors across the country,
07:25.780 - 07:32.100:  one of the few spaces where women could congrade. Even in terms of traveling, Afghan women cannot
07:32.100 - 07:36.340:  travel a significant distance without the presence of a male relative. So clearly,
07:36.860 - 07:40.880:  there have been a lot of challenges there have been facing. So the United States is hoping that
07:40.880 - 07:46.400:  they will be able to use this platform to engage with Taliban to make some concessions on that
07:46.400 - 07:51.180:  front, whether they will or not, we still don't know, but that's expected to dominate the agenda.
07:51.640 - 07:57.380:  So may I hash me into by. In the past 24 hours, Ukrainian military sources have said they've
07:57.380 - 08:03.060:  been making some progress on the southern flank of Bakhmoots, the eastern city captured by Russia in
08:03.060 - 08:08.220:  May after nearly a year of fighting. Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky
08:08.220 - 08:14.160:  visited troops on the front line and praised them for their heroic tasks. The BBC has been given
08:14.160 - 08:18.940:  exclusive access to a team of elite snipers who have been operating in the area for six months.
08:18.940 - 08:22.500:  Our defence correspondent Jonathan Biel sent this report.
08:26.300 - 08:31.920:  At a secret location close to the city of Bakhmoot, a team of Ukrainian snipers are preparing
08:32.500 - 08:34.680:  for another mission close to enemy lines.
08:38.080 - 08:44.840:  Their commander is simply known as Ghost. Ghost used to be my call sign,
08:45.780 - 08:51.880:  but when we started working in this sector, the boys had good results. We brought terror to
08:51.880 - 08:59.820:  Bakhmoot, so we're called the ghosts of Bakhmoot. Their base is already well within range of
08:59.820 - 09:05.100:  Russian artillery. But soon they'll be going even closer to enemy lines.
09:08.480 - 09:14.920:  Artillery always makes people worry. You can hide from artillery, but not from snipers.
09:20.920 - 09:26.320:  The confirmed number is 524. 76 of those are mine.
09:29.440 - 09:34.640:  Kuzia will be the marksman for tonight's mission. Before the war, he worked in a factory.
09:37.520 - 09:44.240:  When I was a civilian, I didn't like weapons, but now I've had to take up arms to defend my country.
09:45.000 - 09:48.140:  Of course I'm scared. Only a fool wouldn't be.
09:49.420 - 09:50.760:  How many Russians have you killed?
09:53.240 - 09:57.560:  I can't tell you. It's not right. It's nothing to be proud of.
10:01.220 - 10:07.720:  We leave a dusk, climbing into an armoured humbeam. In unison, the two men team and driver
10:08.220 - 10:13.680:  do the sign of the cross. They turn on music to lift the mood.
10:16.260 - 10:20.260:  This is now the main road to Bakhmoot, where they're going to drop the sniper team off.
10:21.400 - 10:25.780:  They're just going at speed because they don't want to be hit by artillery shells,
10:25.780 - 10:30.000:  but clearly they're going to be able to just on the side of the road there.
10:32.740 - 10:38.100:  The top is weapon. We must be approaching the drop off point.
10:44.780 - 10:47.540:  I'm going to have to get out of this vehicle at any second now.
10:52.900 - 10:57.440:  Kutscht says God be with you, but then there's another loud blast.
11:03.660 - 11:06.300:  A piece of shrapnel has torn through the back time.
11:07.900 - 11:11.320:  We're going to drop the snipers off. We just told us they've got a flat tire.
11:11.840 - 11:18.500:  It's not a great place. It's a long, nerve-wracking trip home.
11:23.000 - 11:29.500:  Back at base, they anxiously wait for news. Ghost says you handpicked the team because of their patriotism.
11:31.320 - 11:39.360:  Seven hours later, the two man team are extracted, just before the shelling resumes.
11:41.320 - 11:47.880:  The relief is palpable. Kuzia the sniper says the mission was a success.
11:49.020 - 11:51.400:  The target this time, a Russian machine gunner.
11:51.900 - 11:55.980:  Just one shot. One shot, one target.
11:56.580 - 12:00.800:  The commander-ghost calls it dangerous, but noble work.
12:03.420 - 12:08.760:  They came here to our land and we are liberating our land so that we can be free.
12:10.300 - 12:13.700:  The ghosts of back meat will soon have to focus on their next mission.
12:15.000 - 12:19.340:  They're not just lethal marksmen, but also part of Ukraine's psychological war,
12:20.140 - 12:25.300:  firing at the enemy from a place they cannot see, and with a sound they cannot hear.
12:27.020 - 12:29.200:  John Humbail reporting from Eastern Ukraine.
12:30.400 - 12:35.480:  China has long been accused of persecuting the Muslim Weger people in the far-western province of
12:35.480 - 12:41.440:  Xinjiang. Now researchers say that the Chinese communist authorities are pressuring Weger's
12:41.440 - 12:46.800:  living abroad to spy on human rights campaigners. They intimidate people by threatening their
12:46.800 - 12:53.200:  families back home, a tactic that is tearing communities apart. A refugee living in the UK
12:53.200 - 12:56.260:  told our reporter Sam Duda about his experience.
12:57.160 - 13:01.800:  Alune faces a terrible choice. To spy on London's Weger community,
13:01.800 - 13:07.840:  or risked reprisals against his family in China. He's a Weger refugee living in Britain,
13:08.380 - 13:12.140:  having fled China where his family live under intense government surveillance.
13:13.100 - 13:16.760:  But now he says he's been called by a police officer in Xinjiang,
13:16.780 - 13:22.540:  and has been offered a video call with his mother, contact that's almost impossible for Weger's
13:22.540 - 13:28.540:  living overseas. Cause in Xinjiang are tightly monitored, and he doesn't know if his mother has
13:28.540 - 13:33.660:  been taken to an internment camp. Alune, whose name we've changed to hide his identity,
13:33.660 - 13:38.740:  recorded the calls detailing that offer. We've recreated them using actors,
13:39.300 - 13:45.000:  and omitted some details to protect his anonymity. We pay the visit to your family in Xinjiang.
13:45.740 - 13:51.400:  My colleague collected their details. If you want to see them, I can set up a video call.
13:51.800 - 13:56.920:  Yes, please arrange that. I just want to talk to them and find out how they are.
13:56.920 - 14:02.380:  I won't ask about anything else. The video call with his mother went ahead, Alune says,
14:02.960 - 14:09.160:  monitored by Chinese police. It was their first contact in six years, and was so overwhelming
14:09.160 - 14:15.540:  he spent most of it in tears. But there was a price to pay. The officer wanted into gather
14:15.540 - 14:20.620:  intelligence about political campaigners based in London, and send it back to China.
14:21.160 - 14:24.540:  We've heard that Doi Ge activists are planning to meet next month.
14:24.540 - 14:31.240:  We want you to attend and find out what they say, especially the leaders. We know who they are.
14:31.880 - 14:37.600:  If you need, we can't send money. This is a really good opportunity for you to get close to them.
14:38.300 - 14:44.880:  Alune says the implication was clear. If he refused to help, his family in Xinjiang might be harmed.
14:45.540 - 14:50.680:  They took my family hostage, putting me through this all deal. Even though I may appear fine
14:50.680 - 14:56.380:  on the outside. On the inside, I'm suffering. Alune's story is one of many.
14:57.080 - 15:03.060:  Weger refugees living in Britain, Turkey and Norway told us about experiences that follow an
15:03.060 - 15:08.240:  identical pattern. The tactic, offering family access over video call,
15:08.240 - 15:13.280:  an exchange for compliance among its diaspora is commonly used by Chinese police.
15:14.000 - 15:18.520:  According to Dr David Tobin, an academic at Sheffield University in the UK,
15:19.380 - 15:23.140:  he's conducted some of the most comprehensive research on the topic to date.
15:23.720 - 15:30.180:  This is about the way the Chinese government harasses and threatens Weger people abroad and tries
15:30.180 - 15:37.000:  to control their daily activities and their friendships. Most face threats and harassment from
15:37.000 - 15:43.260:  police and government officials, but all experienced family separation. They cannot return home
15:43.260 - 15:49.040:  to see their families. And the impact of that repression is that Weger's struggle to settle
15:49.260 - 15:54.120:  into new societies and they worry that other members of the community could be spies.
15:54.960 - 15:59.500:  Dr Tobin's research suggests two-thirds of the UK's Weger population,
15:59.500 - 16:06.020:  numbering around 400 people, have been directly approached by Chinese police and pressured to spy,
16:06.020 - 16:12.300:  refrain from advocacy work, or stop speaking to the media. A pattern he says is repeated in
16:12.300 - 16:18.760:  other countries around the world. Aline, the Weger refugee who shared details of his offer with
16:18.760 - 16:24.300:  the BBC, says he wants the world to know about what's happening to him and others in his community.
16:25.200 - 16:27.880:  As he told us, he rejected China's offer.
16:28.680 - 16:33.700:  They still refuse to betray my nation and my conscience. This is my life now.
16:34.380 - 16:39.640:  The Chinese government denies the allegations, calling all charges of transnational repression
16:39.640 - 16:45.540:  totally groundless and saying it protects Weger's and their communication with overseas relatives
16:45.540 - 16:52.180:  in accordance with the law. Some juda and you can watch the full report on YouTube by searching for

18:00.340 - 18:05.700:  The governor of the central bank of Lebanon, Riyadh Salamay, is leaving his post today after 30
18:05.980 - 18:11.980:  years but he's not departing with any fanfare instead he is facing corruption charges at home
18:11.980 - 18:17.840:  and abroad. He denies any wrongdoing. A Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher looks back at a man
18:17.840 - 18:24.340:  once celebrated as a financial wizard but who is now reviled by many as the agent of Lebanon's
18:24.340 - 18:30.440:  financial collapse. In a country where family dynasty still holds sway many tainted by their
18:30.440 - 18:35.780:  involvement in the civil war, Riyadh Salamay was for many years seen as a refreshing counterpoint
18:35.780 - 18:41.760:  with a calm and competent stewardship of Lebanon's economy. Many Lebanese enjoyed a standard
18:41.760 - 18:46.240:  of living that seemed at odds with the never-ending turmoil of their political system
18:46.800 - 18:53.240:  but the whole edifice came crashing down in 2019. Since then a financial meltdown has left many
18:53.240 - 18:59.100:  almost penniless and even frozen out of their own bank accounts. Riyadh Salamay was accused of
18:59.100 - 19:04.480:  essentially having run a Ponzi scheme and then a flood of investigations were launched against him
19:04.480 - 19:10.880:  in Europe on accusations of embezzling a fortune with public money, all of which he's denied but
19:10.880 - 19:18.180:  his legacy appears irredeemably tarnished. Sebastian Usher. Over the next few days a full moon will
19:18.180 - 19:25.820:  be visible but unusually it will reappear later in the month of August making it a blue moon and
19:25.820 - 19:30.420:  on top of that they'll both be super moons. The BBC's Justin Webb spoke to Professor Catherine
19:30.420 - 19:39.120:  Hayman's astronomer Royal for Scotland. The moon is orbiting the earth every 27 days and it's not
19:39.120 - 19:43.620:  opting in a circle so sometimes it's closer to the earth and sometimes it's further away
19:44.040 - 19:49.420:  and when it's at its closest point we call it a super moon and these happen roughly three to four
19:49.420 - 19:55.700:  times a year. Now the lunar cycle the difference between when we see a new moon and a full moon
19:55.700 - 20:01.460:  back to new moon again and that cycle is 29 and a half days and that's slightly different from
20:01.460 - 20:07.000:  how long it takes the moon to go around the earth because the reason why we see a full moon or a
20:07.000 - 20:12.680:  new moon is to do with how the moon and the earth and the sun are all lined up with each other.
20:12.980 - 20:18.580:  Usually you have a full moon once every calendar month, sometimes you get two moons in a calendar
20:18.580 - 20:23.620:  month. Now the actual astronomical definition of a blue moon is slightly more complicated than that.
20:23.620 - 20:29.720:  Basically it's roughly when there are two moons in a calendar month and which is happening
20:29.720 - 20:34.940:  in August. So the blue moon is not one event, it's the fact that the two of them being in the
20:34.940 - 20:40.720:  same month. Exactly, it's a special time where you've got two in the same moon. So when we say
20:40.720 - 20:46.600:  one's in a blue moon, how frequent is a blue moon? So a blue moon is every two and a half years
20:46.980 - 20:54.400:  roughly. What's happening now is this combination of the super moons and this blue moon event
20:54.820 - 21:02.240:  and both of the moons that the full moons in in August are going to be super moons and so that's
21:02.240 - 21:07.220:  when the moon is closest to the earth. Now when we say super moon it sounds like it's going to be
21:07.300 - 21:11.480:  really really really big and bright. It's actually only about 6% bigger and brighter than your
21:11.480 - 21:17.380:  average moon. When the moon's and the rising above the horizon, it will really look like this super
21:17.380 - 21:22.720:  moon then because when you've got something to compare the size of the moon to on the horizon,
21:22.720 - 21:27.740:  some sort of perspective, it looks absolutely huge even though it's just an optical illusion.
21:28.260 - 21:33.420:  So when you see the clouds clearing in the next few days, please please head out and have a look
21:33.420 - 21:38.560:  at this gorgeous full moon, take your binoculars or even your smartphones. Some of these smartphones
21:38.560 - 21:44.360:  have amazing cameras on them and just zoom in on those craters. Look at the shadows that the
21:44.360 - 21:50.200:  sunlight is casting in the depths of those craters. It's absolutely gorgeous and well worth a trick
21:50.200 - 21:55.120:  out to look up at our gorgeous night skies. Astronomers Royal Catherine Heyman's
21:55.860 - 22:00.640:  It is crunch time in the women's world. Carpers teams start to be eliminated.
22:01.320 - 22:07.860:  Co hosts New Zealand are already out as are the Olympic champions Canada. Many of the favourites
22:07.860 - 22:12.820:  are still on course to reach the latter stages of the competition, but the top ranked side,
22:12.820 - 22:19.320:  the USA, have been less than convincing. They're still hoping to become the first team to win a third
22:19.320 - 22:25.540:  title in a row, what the North Americans call a three-peat. Boasting global superstars like Alex
22:25.540 - 22:31.000:  Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, they should have a good chance. But as they prepare to face Portugal
22:31.000 - 22:36.580:  on Tuesday in New Zealand, our correspondent there, Shama Khalil, has been investigating whether
22:36.580 - 22:42.960:  it may be a step too far. The USA have everything going for them. They've won two world cups in a
22:42.960 - 22:47.940:  row and are hot favourites to win a record third. But they haven't had a very convincing start.
22:48.700 - 22:52.820:  Yes, they're at the top of the group table, but their first two games, especially that one all
22:52.820 - 22:59.280:  draw against anotherlands, have made fans feel very uneasy. Anne Mustrota and her daughter Katie
22:59.280 - 23:04.420:  have traveled from Washington DC to watch their heroes up close. They tell me it's been quite a
23:04.420 - 23:09.160:  nerve-wracking ride for the stars and stripes so far. You know, I think the first game was easy,
23:09.160 - 23:14.160:  but we didn't make it seem easy enough. I think that made us very concerned. The second game,
23:14.160 - 23:19.420:  I was worried about that game. I don't think it's always bad to have a trip up. If you're going to
23:19.420 - 23:23.000:  have a trip up maybe now is a good time to have a trip up. I hope they get momentum. I hope they
23:23.000 - 23:27.940:  get scared and hungry. Michelle Trippano traveled from New Jersey and she's hoping the team will
23:28.000 - 23:32.100:  up their game. Just hope we can kind of get things done and be more like we were in that second
23:32.100 - 23:37.080:  happen news of the Netherlands game. You can see obviously the rest of the world is catching up
23:37.160 - 23:41.160:  and I think this world cup in general is just going to be a lot more competitive than past years.
23:41.220 - 23:45.560:  We already had a lot of upsets. I think there will probably still be more to come. Hopefully not
23:45.560 - 23:51.540:  with us. In an earlier news conference, the US superstar Megan Rapinoe said that she and the team
23:51.540 - 23:56.400:  are aware of the pressure and the expectations. I think of course there's a little bit of anxiousness
23:56.480 - 24:02.620:  anytime there's a result that needs to be had. That has a little bit of feeling to it.
24:03.620 - 24:08.260:  But I think that's exciting. I think everybody knows that too. Everybody's like okay, like we
24:08.260 - 24:15.620:  we have to perform better and we have to get this result. I mean I think that that is something that
24:16.160 - 24:20.880:  just always gets passed down through the generations of this team is like no we go into these
24:20.880 - 24:26.000:  moments like hell yeah this is exactly where we want to be. Sports journalist Jeff Kassouf has
24:26.000 - 24:30.600:  followed the team's stratospheric rise through the years. He says the challenges off the pitch
24:30.600 - 24:34.700:  have reflected in their performance. There are team that's used to being on top of the world.
24:34.700 - 24:39.940:  There are team that is wobbling a bit and it's coming at a time. World cups are about timing.
24:39.940 - 24:45.520:  The timing for them is consistent injuries, unsure lineup situations and it's made them
24:46.200 - 24:50.340:  very beatable. I don't think anybody's scared of them right now and the floor of this tournament has
24:50.340 - 24:54.780:  come up so much that there is not really a team in this tournament certainly in the knockout round
24:54.960 - 24:58.400:  that you look at and say that's an easy victory for anybody. You look at Columbia being Germany.
24:58.400 - 25:03.900:  So is this a team that's ready for a really tough challenge like that? The fact that the U.S.
25:03.900 - 25:07.680:  is no longer dominant. What does that say about women's soccer, women's football?
25:08.540 - 25:12.600:  Well certainly there's been investment. You see that monetarily. You see that in terms of the
25:12.600 - 25:17.440:  infrastructure around countries like Amaraka who built a whole training center for their team. So
25:18.180 - 25:23.120:  there is a progression in countries that maybe we previously have written off whether that is
25:23.600 - 25:27.820:  a Columbia. Look at Philippines picking up their first victory. This is a testament to the
25:27.820 - 25:33.320:  globalization of the game. A USA victory against Portugal is not only necessary for them to secure
25:33.320 - 25:38.680:  their position in the knockout stages but also to reassure their fans and themselves that the
25:38.680 - 25:42.820:  world number one women's football team is worthy of its formidable status.
25:43.560 - 25:50.160:  Chama Halil in New Zealand. Staying with sport and the popular YouTuber KSI is entering the
25:50.160 - 25:56.940:  boxing ring again. This time he'll fight Tommy Fury, a professional boxer and reality TV star.
25:57.460 - 26:02.440:  Fury beat another YouTuber Jake Paul in the ring in February. So what can we expect from this
26:02.440 - 26:07.440:  latest contest to you in October? Our reporter Yusuf Anani spoke to Charlotte Gallagher.
26:08.040 - 26:12.900:  This is what they call a crossover fight but it's also what boxing purists would call a
26:12.900 - 26:18.940:  bit of a circus fight or a joke shop fight but there would be huge interest in it that there's
26:18.940 - 26:25.480:  no doubt and it will generate a lot of money and KSI has a huge following on YouTube. They'll
26:25.480 - 26:31.020:  all be tuning in. He hasn't been on lately because I think he said something unfortunate has taken
26:31.020 - 26:37.720:  a break so this will help revitalise his career. Tommy Fury calls himself a pure boxer. He's very
26:37.720 - 26:43.720:  well schooled. He's from the Fury family, half brother of Tyson Fury, the everywhere champion.
26:44.140 - 26:50.520:  So he considers himself a real boxer and is himself very disdainful of fights like this against
26:50.520 - 26:55.920:  YouTubers but here he is for the second time signing up to have one and he just can't resist the
26:55.920 - 27:02.640:  money. He calls it easy money but we'll see. How much money are we talking about here? Well
27:02.640 - 27:07.560:  don't know but for the last one he picked up about about three million dollars in Saudi Arabia.
27:07.560 - 27:12.660:  I think the Saudis cannot normally offer a bit more money so this one's in Manchester who probably
27:12.660 - 27:17.120:  be getting a bit less but still a lot of money for something that he considers very easy.
27:17.800 - 27:23.880:  And what do boxing fans make of this trend of influencers, YouTubers, social media stars becoming
27:23.880 - 27:31.920:  boxes? Well the hardcore don't like it. They think it's denigrating the sport. They think that
27:32.220 - 27:38.760:  boxes should face boxes and not part-time boxes or YouTubers. I mean the skill levels aren't the
27:38.800 - 27:47.020:  same. I KSI is a very fit man. He's physically quite gifted but you know he boxes with his hands
27:47.020 - 27:54.060:  down by his waist. He doesn't really have a defence to speak of. So boxing Furious will condemn it
27:54.460 - 28:00.500:  but you know it could well turn into a bit of a brawl so some of them might actually secretly end
28:00.500 - 28:05.640:  up tuning in and enjoying it. And does it get other people involved in boxing as well? Like people
28:05.640 - 28:10.580:  that perhaps wouldn't be attracted to the sport but they watch these YouTubers and they especially
28:10.580 - 28:15.900:  younger people get involved in boxing which I guess is a good thing. Exactly. It's a gateway drug
28:15.900 - 28:20.860:  so people don't know the real sport of boxing but they'll catch this. They'll watch their favorite
28:20.860 - 28:26.600:  YouTuber against someone who is a well-schooled professional boxer and they might see some real
28:26.600 - 28:33.480:  boxes, two real boxes facing off on the undercard and they might go and check those out. So you know
28:33.480 - 28:39.440:  one thing could lead to another and draw them into the real sport itself. Usif and Nani.
28:42.880 - 28:47.140:  And that is all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This
