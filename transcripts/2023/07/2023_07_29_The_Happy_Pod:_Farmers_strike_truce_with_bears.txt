00:00.060 - 00:05.560:  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
00:05.560 - 00:11.680:  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
00:11.680 - 00:17.400:  by advertising. Hi, this is Kerry with some potentially good news if you sent a fax in Taiwan
00:17.400 - 00:21.820:  earlier this month. Hi, my name is Zach Kitscher and I'll be talking about some of the great benefits
00:21.820 - 00:25.700:  of mushrooms. I was sitting there in the crowd, you know, tears in my eyes. This is right for the
00:25.700 - 00:30.320:  happy part. This goes straight to the happy part. So without more ado, this is the happy pod from
00:30.320 - 00:40.640:  the BBC World Service. I'm Jackie Leonard and in this edition uploaded on Saturday the 29th of July.
00:41.600 - 00:47.300:  Hello, I am Maurizio Vela from Bogota, Colombia and I have very happy news for
00:47.300 - 00:53.680:  Andy and Bear Conservation in Colombia and coffee production. How bears and coffee growers can live
00:53.680 - 00:59.840:  in harmony also how playing the underwater sounds of a healthy coral reef on a dead one can
00:59.840 - 01:09.200:  lure back fish. Some fish makes it a chattering sounds. Others buzz or grunt or hum or bellow.
01:10.200 - 01:15.800:  Limiting forest fires by the strategic deployment of mushrooms. You can kind of think of it as a
01:15.800 - 01:20.200:  sponge layer. We're creating a landscape which is able to catch and hold more moisture
01:20.540 - 01:25.960:  and help to fight wildfire in the process. And a very memorable first day at work for an Italian
01:32.000 - 01:37.220:  lifeguard. First two Colombia where conservationists have helped broker a truce between coffee growers
01:37.220 - 01:42.360:  and the bears that share the land. The bears were seeded as a threat to crops and livestock,
01:42.400 - 01:47.720:  but a programme was launched to provide help and resources for farmers in exchange for bear
01:47.720 - 01:54.880:  protection. It's a win-win. Harry Bly reports. Coffee is big business in Colombia. The South American
01:54.880 - 02:00.880:  nation is the world's third largest exporter of it with almost three and a half thousand square
02:00.880 - 02:07.400:  kilometres of mountainous land dedicated to Arabica coffee beans. But it's not just coffee beans that
02:07.400 - 02:14.180:  enjoy Colombia's nutrient-rich volcanic soil and humid climate. For years there's been a clash
02:14.180 - 02:22.700:  between farmers and other locals. That's the sound of an Andean bear. It's South America's last
02:22.700 - 02:29.360:  bear species native to the continent's mountains that stretch from Argentina to Venezuela. They're
02:29.360 - 02:34.440:  smaller than their North American and European cousins at around a metre and a half tall.
02:35.100 - 02:40.960:  They have black fur with cream spots on the chest and face and it's these markings that give them
02:40.960 - 02:46.860:  their other name, spectacle bears. And while these bears don't wear Wellington boots or eat marmalade
02:46.860 - 02:52.040:  sandwiches they are thought to be the inspiration for a well-known children's book character.
02:52.300 - 02:56.780:  Well I've got a bear name but it seems to be rather hard to pronounce. Perhaps you'd like an
02:56.780 - 03:03.580:  English name? Paddington. Paddington. Paddington. Yes Paddington who also hails from the Andean
03:03.660 - 03:10.280:  jungle. The Andean bear is a wonderful beautiful species. Maricio Vela Vargas is a biologist
03:10.280 - 03:16.820:  specializing in big mammals at Colombia's Wildlife Conservation Society. Andean bears are in
03:16.820 - 03:25.180:  constant interaction with human communities and Andean bears mainly eat plants but in some cases
03:25.180 - 03:31.480:  they can attack cattle. And that's where the problems arose. With their natural habitat taken
03:31.480 - 03:38.140:  over by agriculture Andean bears would roam a farmland in search of food, eating crops and
03:38.140 - 03:44.000:  sometimes cattle. And the farmers fought back, often slaughtering the bears in retaliation.
03:44.960 - 03:51.620:  Today Andean bears are classed as a vulnerable species. In 2017 the worldwide fund for nature
03:52.020 - 03:57.780:  estimated that around 8,000 bears were left in Colombia. That number is probably lower now.
03:58.680 - 04:03.620:  The Colombian Wildlife Conservation Society is one of the bodies behind a program called
04:03.620 - 04:09.360:  Conservamos La Vida or Let's Preserve Life. Maricio is one of the coordinators.
04:09.740 - 04:16.380:  Inside of the farms we identify the priority areas for conservation like small patches of forest,
04:16.380 - 04:25.160:  the creeks, water holes and in compensation we start working with the communities and the main
04:25.160 - 04:30.920:  objective is generating co-existence. And in return for co-existing with their four-legged neighbors,
04:30.920 - 04:36.380:  farmers receive coffee growing and processing equipment, tools for better water infrastructure
04:36.380 - 04:40.880:  and help fencing in their farm animals to keep them safe from hungry bears.
04:41.440 - 04:48.280:  They also get a special label on their coffee products that reads Caffeoso and Dino. Andean bear coffee,
04:48.300 - 04:53.380:  a scheme which project leaders say has created many jobs in the area, not to mention
04:53.380 - 05:00.520:  boosting a wide variety of wildlife. Last week we had the records of the presence of cougars and
05:00.520 - 05:07.420:  deers and the bears inside of the farms. And the people it's happy to know that they are
05:07.420 - 05:12.920:  maintaining and helping to conserve different species of mammals in these areas.
05:14.000 - 05:18.120:  Maricio Vela Vargas from Bogota, ending that report by Harry Bly.
05:19.000 - 05:24.160:  Now a combination of nature, scientific brilliance and best of all excellent sounds.
05:24.860 - 05:29.520:  We know that coral reefs are beautiful, important and currently at risk.
05:29.860 - 05:34.100:  Australia's great barrier reef has suffered extensive damage as a result of warming
05:34.100 - 05:39.700:  waters, pollution and so on. But a lot of people are working to try to help these areas recover.
05:40.300 - 05:45.420:  And now it turns out that playing the underwater sounds of a healthy coral reef to a dead one
05:45.420 - 05:50.460:  entices back fish. And that means the nutrients that they bring with them.
05:50.860 - 05:55.780:  It's hoped that that discovery can be used to superpower reef regeneration projects.
05:56.440 - 05:58.600:  This is marine biologist Tim Lamont.
06:03.440 - 06:07.740:  When we listen with a special underwater microphone, we hear all sorts of weird and
06:07.740 - 06:12.720:  wonderful noises on a healthy reef. So first you'll hear this sort of background crackle.
06:12.860 - 06:16.620:  It sounds a bit like radio static or like bacon frying in a pan.
06:18.480 - 06:22.740:  And what it is is it's the sound of thousands of snapping shrimp all clicking their claws.
06:23.360 - 06:25.660:  A sunfish makes sort of chattering sounds.
06:28.360 - 06:29.800:  Others make whooping sounds.
06:33.100 - 06:36.820:  Others buzz or grunt or hum or bellow.
06:37.880 - 06:42.320:  There are so many sounds that we're struggling to come up with words to describe them sometimes.
06:45.420 - 06:50.660:  I was studying the soundscape of coral reefs to try and understand what we could learn about reefs
06:51.060 - 06:55.560:  by listening to them, how we could monitor their diversity and changes in their health state.
06:55.880 - 07:00.360:  Now at the start of my PhD I went to the Great Barrier Reef for the first time and I was really
07:00.360 - 07:04.340:  excited. I was like a kid before Christmas on the plane. You know I'd heard so much about this
07:04.340 - 07:11.560:  place. I'd read so much about this place. It was like arriving at a battle scene just after the battle.
07:11.820 - 07:17.560:  Bleaching and cyclones had just caused huge damage on this area of the barrier reef and parts of
07:17.560 - 07:25.780:  it were like a graveyard. It was quite horrifying to see. We could hear the difference.
07:26.520 - 07:33.940:  We could hear the sort of the emptiness, the quietness, the lack of noise and diversity and
07:34.100 - 07:40.620:  and the loudness on this reef. It was quite heartbreaking to hear and it also was was quite
07:40.620 - 07:47.380:  distressing because they no longer sounded attractive to fishes. Maybe as part of attempts to
07:47.380 - 07:53.000:  restore reefs we should be restoring the sound as well as what we could see. So we had these
07:53.000 - 07:57.820:  underwater loudspeakers that are usually used by synchronized swimmers in swimming pools
07:58.360 - 08:02.700:  and we worked out that you could power those using a motorcycle battery with a little MP3
08:02.700 - 08:08.300:  player attached to it. That all went in a little barrel that type you'd sort of take water in if
08:08.300 - 08:16.280:  you were going on a canoe trip or something. The healthy sounding reefs attracted twice as many
08:16.280 - 08:21.360:  fish back to them and over the course of about six weeks they developed a community that was twice
08:21.360 - 08:28.860:  as abundant. That was really encouraging to us. Fish and reefs have evolved together
08:30.140 - 08:34.720:  over hundreds of thousands of years and really they can't live without each other.
08:38.160 - 08:43.900:  Marine Biologist Tim Lamont on luring life back to the Great Barrier Reef and there is more on
08:43.900 - 08:48.700:  this brilliant idea from our colleagues at People Fixing the World just look for them online.
08:49.900 - 08:54.120:  Now to a possible natural solution to one of the biggest problems facing several parts of the
08:54.120 - 09:00.040:  world right now the headlines have been full of wildfires sweeping across large areas of Europe and
09:00.040 - 09:06.480:  North Africa. They are also regularly an issue in the US Australia and Russia. So what can we do to
09:06.480 - 09:12.620:  limit the spread and damage caused? One man in Boulder, Colorado in the United States thinks we
09:12.620 - 09:18.520:  should turn to the humble mushroom for help. That man is Zach Headstrom who happens to be a mushroom
09:18.520 - 09:23.720:  expert. When the forestry crews come through they're generating a large amount of wood biomass
09:24.320 - 09:30.120:  and generally that biomass gets chipped up and those wood chips can then be distributed along the
09:30.120 - 09:37.300:  forest floor and then sprayed with a fungal and oculent solution essentially a slurry of mushroom
09:37.340 - 09:42.900:  roots you could call them. It's called mycelium which gets worked into this wood chip material and
09:42.900 - 09:49.220:  then becomes essentially a vehicle for the wood chips to hold more moisture in the process as well
09:49.220 - 09:54.620:  as decomposed faster. Here in the air at west it can take anywhere from 20 to 50 years for these
09:54.620 - 09:59.440:  wood chips to decompose and when we introduce the native fungi we're seeing substantial decomposition
09:59.500 - 10:04.160:  within two years and also an increase in the moisture holding capacity of the wood chips
10:04.460 - 10:09.100:  so you can kind of think of it as a as a sponge layer on the floor. We're creating a landscape
10:09.100 - 10:13.720:  which is able to catch and hold more moisture and help to fight wildfire in the process.
10:13.980 - 10:19.580:  Is this a system that you think could be applied elsewhere in the world that is affected by
10:19.580 - 10:25.460:  these wildfires? Absolutely I think that this in principle can be applied all over the world.
10:25.460 - 10:31.980:  That being said though we believe in using native fungi for each specific region so for example
10:31.980 - 10:38.720:  in Greece where there's wildfires raging we would suggest cloning or obtaining a strain of
10:38.720 - 10:43.520:  mushroom out of their own local environment. Did all of this come to you in a blinding light?
10:43.520 - 10:49.260:  At what point did you think oh my goodness my specialism can help solve this quite serious problem?
10:49.620 - 10:55.500:  I grew up in Boulder, Colorado spending a lot of time in the Rocky Mountains as a kid wandering
10:55.500 - 11:02.600:  through the forest looking at plants and mushrooms and so I started to observe a lot about the way
11:02.600 - 11:08.240:  that the ecosystem functions and the way that the forest takes care of itself and this led me to
11:08.240 - 11:15.980:  mushrooms because I was able to see with my own eyes how wood and plant matter is so quickly and
11:15.980 - 11:23.060:  effectively recycled back into soil without any kind of human intervention at all. Just by taking
11:23.060 - 11:27.880:  notice of the patterns which are already existing in nature I think we can really start to address
11:27.980 - 11:35.000:  our climate crisis and our man-made issues just with some of the wisdom which is already existing
11:35.000 - 11:40.420:  all around us. I think that if we can start to pay more attention to nature and take inspiration
11:40.420 - 11:47.620:  from nature we can learn a lot about ways to live more harmoniously on this planet and just be
11:47.620 - 11:53.520:  better stewards of the earth. My college is Zach Headstrom. Now think back to your first day at work
11:53.520 - 12:00.340:  meeting your colleagues learning how everything functions a first day can be daunting. Now meet 19
12:00.340 - 12:08.600:  year old Naomi Marangon an Italian lifeguard who saved five lives on Zabaldia Beach on her first day.
12:09.420 - 12:15.380:  I was looking around making sure no one got in trouble then I realized that was a man who was in
12:15.380 - 12:21.840:  trouble and run to him by screaming because it wasn't possible to take the bus. I just was screaming
12:21.840 - 12:29.080:  and forced his life but then his wife and his son came to help him and got trapped into the same
12:29.080 - 12:36.700:  danger. So I had to say three lives had a one and then when I got back and take a breath
12:37.100 - 12:43.560:  because it was very very difficult to save them. I realized that another guy was trapped in the
12:43.560 - 12:51.600:  same trouble with his brother so I had to go back here and save him too. I felt really anxious
12:51.600 - 12:58.040:  about it because I thought I couldn't do it but then when I realized I could save them I just run
12:58.040 - 13:05.420:  and feel satisfied for myself. There are not many women to do my job but the girls that are in my team
13:05.420 - 13:12.080:  are very proud of me. Five lives saved before lunch, braver lifeguard Naomi Marangon.
13:16.600 - 13:22.240:  Still to come in this podcast? Programs like this keep your mind going you're getting smarter as you
13:22.240 - 13:27.520:  go you learn you feel better. How education is helping prisoners turn their lives around.
13:33.400 - 13:38.200:  Now this was sent to us by Sophia a student from Canada currently living in Latvia.
13:51.820 - 14:10.280:  This is a clip from the Latvian song and dance festival. This year Latvia celebrated its 150 year
14:10.280 - 14:17.760:  anniversary of the festival. 40,000 performers come from all different corners of Latvia and 500,000
14:17.760 - 14:23.860:  people show up in audience but at the final performance that's a 15,000 person choir that you're
14:23.860 - 14:30.420:  listening to. You really get a sense of the unity that's the entire Latvian nation appreciates
14:30.740 - 14:37.180:  choirs and appreciates singing. It's a real experience just sitting there and listening to these
14:37.360 - 14:43.880:  these lyrics that also reflect Latvia's struggle for preserving its own culture throughout
14:43.880 - 14:49.320:  its history. It really was inspiring and it honestly it brought me to tears. With my family as
14:49.320 - 14:55.600:  well from Ukraine I really feel connected to traditional music and traditional songs that were
14:56.320 - 15:01.540:  written years ago just knowing that these songs have passed through so many years of history
15:01.540 - 15:06.820:  and have persevered throughout history really is just inspiring. I was sitting there in the crowd
15:06.860 - 15:10.380:  you know tears in my eyes. This is right for the happy thought. This goes straight to the happy
15:11.480 - 15:16.900:  and we're very grateful for that. Thank you Sophia, a Canadian in Latvia. To the US now and a
15:16.900 - 15:21.980:  plan to try to help prison inmates turn their lives around. Starting this month the US government will
15:21.980 - 15:27.920:  be expanding student grants for prisoners to help them get university and college degrees in jail
15:27.920 - 15:32.860:  the better to build a new life outside. The BBC's Peter Goffin has been finding out more.
15:33.320 - 15:38.940:  We've been taking all the top college class of philosophy which is one of my favorites chemistry,
15:38.940 - 15:45.700:  thermal dynamics which is my worst but. Broadway Collins is working toward a bachelor's degree at
15:45.700 - 15:52.300:  Northwestern University. One of the top rated schools in the US but he began his academic journey
15:52.300 - 15:59.400:  at a very different institution. Stateville Correctional Center. When I first got my my
15:59.400 - 16:05.540:  transfer with my grades on it I finally felt good about like man something programs like this
16:05.540 - 16:11.680:  keep your mind going you get smarter as you go you learn you feel better. Mr. Hollins who was released
16:11.680 - 16:17.900:  from Stateville last year has not had to pay tuition fees because Northwestern waves costs for
16:17.900 - 16:24.440:  members of its prison education program. So-called tough on crime laws past 30 years ago in the US
16:24.440 - 16:30.140:  banned prisoners from receiving government assistance for underprivileged post-secondary students
16:30.140 - 16:37.000:  known as Pell Grants. That aid has been restored on a limited basis over the past few years
16:37.240 - 16:43.820:  but as of this month it's being drastically expanded with the government set to issue $130 million
16:43.820 - 16:51.280:  to around 30,000 incarcerated students each year. Nick Turner is the head of Vera a pressure group
16:51.280 - 16:58.300:  working to end mass incarceration. The return of access to post-secondary education provided by
16:58.300 - 17:05.840:  these grants means that people will be able to get degrees and trades that the evidence shows
17:06.720 - 17:12.820:  increases their access to employment and for society at large it's a much better thing too
17:12.820 - 17:18.300:  because it reduces what we call recidivism you know returns to to prison. It's up to each
17:18.300 - 17:24.620:  university in college to decide whether and how to run prison programs and only certain prisons
17:24.620 - 17:30.400:  participate. Others say people in prison should be given the chance to put their learning to use.
17:30.780 - 17:34.780:  People are obtaining associates, bachelors and masters or whatnot and yet they might still have
17:34.780 - 17:40.100:  five to ten, 15 years left on their sentence so how can we find ways for people to apply and
17:40.100 - 17:44.640:  use that education during incarceration and also help them make money.
17:44.640 - 17:49.820:  Ved Price is the executive director of the Alliance for Higher Education in prison.
17:50.400 - 17:53.520:  He also took post-secondary classes while serving time.
17:53.520 - 17:58.180:  What would it mean for people to come home with five ten thousand dollars to house some agency
17:58.180 - 18:03.960:  over their reentry to help pay for housing to help pay for transportation to help them get stable in
18:03.960 - 18:10.320:  the community. Proponents of these education grants from prisoners to activists to president Joe Biden
18:11.020 - 18:17.020:  himself say they could be life changing for many of the approximately two million people in U.S.
18:17.020 - 18:22.380:  prisons. That was Peter Goffin now some of the other things that caught our eye over the last
18:22.380 - 18:27.320:  few days. You might have seen that the river Sen in Paris has been so dramatically cleaned up
18:27.620 - 18:32.640:  that it'll be possible to swim and dive in its waters. Swimming in the Sen was banned for a century
18:32.640 - 18:37.780:  because it was so dirty but a huge amount has been spent on regeneration and the Paris Olympics
18:37.780 - 18:44.700:  next year will have three Olympic and Paralympic events triathlon marathon swimming and para triathlon
18:44.700 - 18:50.440:  scheduled to take place in the river. A three year old boy in India is recovering after being
18:50.440 - 18:56.780:  rescued from a 12 meter deep well in eastern Bihar state. The rescue of Shivam Kumar took eight hours.
18:57.460 - 19:03.020:  A painting recently found to be undoubtedly by the Renaissance artist Raphael has gone on show
19:03.020 - 19:08.220:  for the first time. The Debrasi Tondo had been subject of study for decades because of its
19:08.220 - 19:14.040:  resemblance to Raphael's Sistine Madonna but some thought it was a Victorian copy. Teams from
19:14.040 - 19:19.760:  the English universities of Nottingham Bradford used facial recognition technology to prove it's
19:19.760 - 19:25.460:  the real deal and another bear story because there are never enough bear stories. A hiker who says
19:25.460 - 19:32.360:  he was saved from a bear in the US by the voice of the Scottish comedian Raymond Mans. Ian McAllister
19:32.360 - 19:37.500:  was doing the Pacific Crest Trail in California. I was hiking up a hill and when I'm hiking up a
19:37.500 - 19:43.200:  hill I like to listen to a podcast when you're having a laugh the hill goes much quicker. A bear
19:43.200 - 19:49.840:  popped on to the track the trail right in front of me. The bear turned round and looked to me but
19:49.840 - 19:56.160:  before I could make any noise to scare it off it heard Raymond's voice on the podcast and it ran
19:56.160 - 20:01.940:  away. They run at 30 miles an hour and I think maybe this was about 40. So what does Raymond think
20:01.940 - 20:09.940:  he said to spook the bear? I have no idea. I've been in California. I went up to Lake Tahoe and I've
20:09.940 - 20:17.960:  walked through the woods in California. It never really dawned on me at the time that I had special
20:17.960 - 20:23.400:  bear protection because after we we kind of walked through the forest at Lake Tahoe I thought
20:23.760 - 20:29.280:  hang on if we'd have clocked a bear a bear would have we could have been in big trouble. Unbeknown to
20:29.280 - 20:36.080:  me that I'm a bear repellent. Raymond Mans and the podcast he was on was breaking the news but we
20:36.080 - 20:40.760:  cannot promise it will protect you from wild animals so do follow advice from people who actually
20:40.760 - 20:46.260:  know what they're talking about not us. Now back to the water and a solution to stopping plastic
20:46.260 - 20:51.720:  from being washed down drains into rivers and oceans. A Dutch company has come up with a bubbly
20:51.720 - 20:57.240:  way of heading that litter off before it can do too much damage to marine wildlife. The BBC's Richard
20:57.240 - 21:05.140:  Kenny went to Amsterdam in the Netherlands to see for himself. I'm standing on the Prinsen
21:05.140 - 21:10.040:  Grat. It's one of the main canals which are such a major attraction of the city of Amsterdam.
21:11.020 - 21:16.020:  Tourist boats are chugging along them so people can see the city at its best from the water
21:16.980 - 21:22.780:  but these canals aren't just carrying tourists they're also carrying a lot of the city's litter.
21:23.980 - 21:30.040:  We're a very water-rich city we have 150 kilometers of canals and what happens is that garbage
21:30.900 - 21:37.640:  debris plastic from the shores from the sides from the streets get into the water and it all flows
21:37.760 - 21:43.660:  through the canals to one of our six exits to our main river and that river goes into sea.
21:44.220 - 21:49.100:  That's art bright brine from the regional water authority what's in it. The problem with plastic is
21:49.120 - 21:54.320:  it doesn't disappear you just get smaller and smaller and smaller it gets the easier it gets into
21:54.320 - 22:02.420:  animals into people and it will be bad in general for biodiversity. Here, now we can still get it.
22:06.600 - 22:11.740:  And this is the sound of the solution that some ingenious young scientists have come up with
22:11.980 - 22:17.980:  to get that plastic. It's called the Great Bubble Barrier and it sits at one of the exit points
22:17.980 - 22:23.400:  where the canals go into the river. Philip Airhorn is one of the people behind it.
22:23.860 - 22:28.360:  Well, we're catching plastic here before it has a chance to flow out towards the ocean.
22:28.420 - 22:34.100:  It's quite literally a tube that we place diagonally on the bottom of the waterway and then we pump
22:34.100 - 22:39.940:  air through it the hose is perforated so tiny little air bubbles will start to rise and that creates
22:39.940 - 22:46.640:  an upwards current which can lift plastic to the surface and then add the surface together with
22:46.640 - 22:51.120:  the natural flow of the river. It will all be pushed towards the collection area where we can then
22:51.120 - 22:56.240:  remove it from the water. Does it stop fish going through the water? So we are still looking at this
22:56.240 - 23:01.320:  very carefully to show that we really don't have an negative impact. So far there's nothing that
23:01.320 - 23:07.340:  suggests we do. I felt one fish expert say bubbles is something of a daily life of a fish.
23:07.980 - 23:13.260:  Well, most of the passes by when they notice it seem to think the bubble barrier is a good idea.
23:13.740 - 23:18.500:  Oh, nice. It's a very nice, cute idea too because it doesn't look bad as well.
23:18.500 - 23:25.620:  No, it adds something to the canal, I think. It's not polluting, it doesn't stop any boat to go
23:25.780 - 23:29.880:  up and down in the canals. So yeah, I think it's a great idea.
23:32.140 - 23:38.040:  That report by Richard Cany in Amsterdam. Do you keep your receipts? If you're in Taiwan,
23:38.040 - 23:43.900:  it's probably a good idea too. One lucky person has won the jackpot on what's known as the
23:43.900 - 23:49.360:  receipt lottery on a very small investment indeed. Carrie Allen is our China media analyst.
23:50.040 - 23:56.540:  This time, the winner of the big prize, this $342,000 US dollar prize, what they did was they
23:56.540 - 24:03.980:  sent a fax for the equivalent of about 50 cents. So they spent a very small amount of money and of
24:03.980 - 24:11.560:  one a huge amount. And just to back up a little bit on the win, a fax. A fax? Yes, I didn't even know
24:11.560 - 24:17.220:  that people still sent faxes anymore. So this is obviously lit up Taiwanese media with people saying,
24:17.220 - 24:23.580:  yeah, who sends a fax anymore? So we were a bit baffled by this because I thought gambling's not
24:23.580 - 24:29.280:  a thing in Taiwan. It isn't, no, gambling is illegal in Taiwan and this is the state lottery.
24:29.280 - 24:36.280:  It's really the only legal form of gambling in the region. In order to get a ticket, you basically
24:36.280 - 24:42.660:  just buy things in shops and you get an eight digit number at the bottom of your receipt and six
24:42.660 - 24:50.920:  times a year, a lottery is drawn and people can win prizes as big as $342,000 US dollars.
24:51.220 - 24:59.420:  And at this point, although we know that a fax was the cause of the win, what do we know about the
24:59.420 - 25:03.700:  winner? Well, we don't actually know who they are yet and obviously there's some speculation on
25:03.700 - 25:09.080:  social media that this is probably somebody who's a lot older because the younger generation,
25:09.080 - 25:14.860:  I don't know, would have even heard of a fax, less alone sent one. But yes, we do know that they
25:14.860 - 25:19.960:  can claim their prize from the Sixth of August onwards. This story has obviously got people
25:19.960 - 25:23.900:  looking at their receipts at home and thinking, you know, could they have won because
25:23.900 - 25:29.700:  there have been in the past unclaimed prizes because these numbers on physical receipts.
25:29.980 - 25:35.480:  So yeah, to give you an idea of some of the previous winnings, there was back in March,
25:35.480 - 25:41.160:  someone who won this huge amount of money, they bought an adult toy and again,
25:41.160 - 25:46.380:  they might be somebody who's not come forward or want to keep things quiet and this might be the case
25:46.380 - 25:50.840:  also with this person who sent the fax. They might come and collect their winnings but they might
25:50.840 - 25:55.260:  actually not reveal who they are. So the moral of the story is don't throw away your receipts?
25:55.600 - 25:59.980:  Yeah, if you've got a receipt just hanging around in your pocket or your handbag that it could
26:00.260 - 26:05.480:  make you a life-changing amount of money. Carry Alan, rifling through her handbag as we speak.
26:10.120 - 26:13.400:  And that's it from us for now, but before we go, another word from Sophia.
26:13.900 - 26:17.240:  If you'd like to send the sound that brings you joy like I did,
26:17.240 - 26:23.480:  just email global podcast at bbc.co.uk and send us anything else you'd like as well to be honest.
26:23.480 - 26:28.800:  This edition was mixed by Chris Lovelock and the producers were Anna Murphy and Tracy Gordon.
26:29.140 - 26:33.200:  Our editor is Karen Martin, I'm Jackie Leonard and until next time, goodbye.
26:42.920 - 26:46.840:  Season two of the bomb unravels the mystery of Klaus Fuchs.
26:47.080 - 26:50.700:  Klaus Fuchs was a brilliant theorist, he was a brilliant mathematician.
26:50.700 - 26:55.420:  He was highly respected. They had to have a nuclear weapon. Fuchs became almost
26:55.480 - 27:01.880:  completely invaluable. Atomic scientists at the core of the British and American nuclear research
27:01.880 - 27:08.680:  programs. He was a magnet, he was recognised right away for his brilliance. He for the sake of his
27:08.680 - 27:15.620:  convictions led a secret double life. Klaus Fuchs was the perfect spy. He'd given the Russians
27:15.760 - 27:20.200:  the plans to the Pintonian bomb. This was going to change the world.
27:20.200 - 27:26.100:  Search for the bomb, a podcast from the BBC World Service, wherever you found this podcast.
