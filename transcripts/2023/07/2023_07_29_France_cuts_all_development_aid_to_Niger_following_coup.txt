00:49.180 - 00:52.520:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:55.540 - 01:01.140:  Hi, I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Sunday, the 30th of July, these are our main stories.
01:01.140 - 01:08.580:  France cuts all development aid to Niger as African and Western powers unite in condemnation of Wednesday's military coup.
01:08.980 - 01:15.900:  What we're seeing is a significant ratcheting up over the last 24 hours of international efforts to try and reverse the coup.
01:16.460 - 01:20.680:  The son of Colombia's president is arrested on charges of money laundering and corruption,
01:21.140 - 01:26.680:  and Kenya offers to lead a multinational force to Haiti where clashes between criminal gangs and the police
01:27.000 - 01:28.640:  have displaced tens of thousands.
01:31.720 - 01:37.620:  Also in this podcast, Russia's Wagner mercenary group is accused of smuggling illegal migrants into Poland.
01:37.620 - 01:44.680:  And I think it's a reflection of immense political will and commitment to the biggest one is really people on the ground
01:44.680 - 01:49.380:  who are working on a day-to-day basis in terms of protecting tigers and conserving its habitat.
01:50.060 - 01:56.560:  After decades of decline, why India has a good reason to celebrate on World Tiger Day, stay tuned to find out.
02:00.140 - 02:06.980:  Until just a few days ago, Nishir was regarded as one of the few stable democratic countries in Africa, Sahel region.
02:07.580 - 02:08.020:  No longer.
02:08.260 - 02:11.840:  A military coup on Wednesday ousted the democratically elected leader.
02:12.120 - 02:16.640:  The country, once seen as a key partner to the West in the fight against Islamic insurgents,
02:17.060 - 02:21.100:  has now gone down the same road as its neighbors Marley and Bikino Faso,
02:21.100 - 02:24.820:  African and Western powers have united in condemning the coup.
02:24.820 - 02:31.380:  On a visit to Australia, the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken added his voice to the chorus of disapproval.
02:31.920 - 02:33.600:  Let me be very, very clear about this.
02:33.740 - 02:37.140:  Our economic and security partnership with Nishir, which is significant.
02:37.140 - 02:43.740:  Hundreds of millions of dollars depends on the continuation of the democratic governance and constitutional order
02:43.740 - 02:47.080:  that has been disrupted by the actions in the last few days.
02:47.360 - 02:53.780:  That assistance, that support, is in clear jeopardy, which is another reason why they need to be immediately reversed.
02:54.300 - 02:59.020:  Well, France has now notched things up again by suspending all development aid to Nishir,
02:59.020 - 03:02.740:  and the EU has withdrawn its financial and security cooperation.
03:02.940 - 03:07.120:  Professor Nick Westcott is a former British ambassador to Nishir.
03:07.660 - 03:12.860:  What we're seeing is a significant ratcheting up over the last 24 hours of international efforts
03:12.860 - 03:14.600:  to try and reverse the coup.
03:15.220 - 03:21.960:  At the outset, there was some hesitation because they didn't wish to impose two severe sanctions
03:21.960 - 03:25.720:  immediately, but I think now in consultation with African countries,
03:25.720 - 03:31.840:  we've seen the AU give a very tight deadline, 15 days, for the return to civilian rule,
03:32.440 - 03:36.340:  and the U.S. and the EU are coming in saying, we will stop our support.
03:36.840 - 03:39.120:  So, are the coup leaders taking any notice?
03:39.500 - 03:43.700:  Our correspondent Chris Awaka is monitoring the situation from neighboring Nigeria.
03:44.500 - 03:52.300:  This is something that's going to pile lots of pressure on the coup leaders and maybe lead to
03:52.300 - 03:59.180:  some action on the part of the mutineering soldiers that will have also seen the African Union
03:59.180 - 04:06.400:  giving the strongest reaction so far asking the soldiers to go to the barracks and all insisting
04:06.400 - 04:12.060:  that the outside president, Mohamed Basump, should be released and the soldier should allow
04:12.560 - 04:15.000:  constitutional democracy to prevail in the country.
04:15.240 - 04:19.100:  So, you have all these international countries threatening sanctions.
04:19.100 - 04:23.940:  Is it possible that the coup leaders are going to simply look towards Russia for support?
04:24.240 - 04:30.040:  Well, it's very difficult at this moment to know the direction of the coup leaders in an
04:30.040 - 04:36.440:  address to the nation on Friday, General Adrahmani Chani gave reasons why the
04:36.780 - 04:42.200:  virtual government, he said that it was not to allow the country degenerate into a form of
04:42.320 - 04:48.260:  anarchy because he felt that the approach the president Basump was using in fighting
04:48.260 - 04:53.440:  insecurity, especially Jihadist extremism in the country wasn't working.
04:54.000 - 05:00.280:  Now, because he is also part of the government, many people are taking this explanation with a
05:00.280 - 05:06.460:  pinch of salt and remember that Niger has been landlocked and poor, one of the poorest actually
05:06.460 - 05:13.540:  in the world is still the seventh producer of uranium and of course many countries are interested
05:13.540 - 05:18.620:  in that mineral. So, when the neighbors, Mali and Bukinafaso,
05:19.080 - 05:26.240:  civilized with the West and have now created a kind of link with Russia and the Wagner group,
05:26.240 - 05:33.640:  it is really likely that based on the support that the people had given the soja sofa
05:33.980 - 05:39.440:  and also within the flag and even asking Russia to intervene in the situation in that country,
05:39.860 - 05:45.620:  there is that possibility that we might be seeing some some of external influence but
05:45.620 - 05:52.340:  these has not been fully disclosed yet. You mentioned the coup leaders citing the struggle
05:52.340 - 05:56.680:  against Islamic insurgency as one of their reasons for mounting this. Of course,
05:57.340 - 06:05.220:  the US had 1100 troops on the ground in Niger. France has 1500 troops on the ground in Niger.
06:05.780 - 06:09.860:  What's going to happen to them? Well, that's the big question. We have seen what happened
06:10.220 - 06:18.760:  in Mali, for instance, where they decided to civilize and ask the troops of the United Nations
06:18.760 - 06:26.520:  as well as France to live their country. So, I think the Western allies risked the same situation.
06:26.560 - 06:31.320:  So, everybody will be watching what's going to be the outcome of a meeting that will be held
06:31.320 - 06:37.300:  in Abuja on Sunday hosted by the Nigerian president to try to react and see how to chat
06:37.300 - 06:43.420:  the wave forward in the crisis in the Jair. Chris Ewaka, a year after Colombia's first
06:43.420 - 06:48.320:  left-wing government was elected, President Gustavo Petro's oldest son has been arrested on charges
06:48.320 - 06:54.080:  of money laundering and illicit enrichment. Nicholas Petro's ex-wife claimed that he received
06:54.080 - 06:58.740:  large amounts of money from drug traffickers for his father's election campaign, but instead,
06:58.740 - 07:03.580:  her former husband used it to pay for a luxury lifestyle. President Petro denies receiving
07:03.580 - 07:10.120:  any of the money Luis Fajardo is in the capital Bogota. It's a very big story in Colombia.
07:10.120 - 07:15.360:  As you may imagine, it's the first time ever that the son of a sitting president is arrested
07:15.360 - 07:22.220:  under suspicion of graft. The belief is that in Nicholas Petro, who was an important person
07:22.220 - 07:28.020:  during the presidential campaign that led to the election of President Petro in 2022. He now
07:28.020 - 07:34.180:  faces accusations of having received illicit funds, and this is a very big scandal in Colombia,
07:34.700 - 07:39.900:  particularly if you take into account that President Petro, who was the first ever left-wing
07:39.900 - 07:46.400:  president elected in Colombia, had campaigned specifically on a promise to clean up the system
07:46.400 - 07:52.000:  to fight against corruption, and now he faces a very big corruption scandal in his very immediate
07:52.260 - 07:58.160:  family. Yeah, because these allegations came from his former wife, who has also been detained.
07:58.480 - 08:03.640:  That is true. The couple became estranged shortly after the presidential election,
08:03.640 - 08:09.700:  and she accused Nicholas Petro, the son of the president, of having received funds from illicit
08:09.700 - 08:17.360:  sources. Of course, now she herself is facing former accusations related to this entire scandal.
08:17.360 - 08:23.840:  Any reaction from the president? The president himself tweeted this morning saying that he was,
08:23.840 - 08:31.260:  of course, saddened by the personal crisis involving his family, but he insisted that he would not
08:31.260 - 08:38.460:  interfere with the judicial investigations against his son. He has said that justice has to take
08:38.460 - 08:43.220:  its decisions without his interference, without the interference of the government. What have people
08:43.220 - 08:48.060:  made of what he's said? Because on the surface, it sounds pretty good, doesn't it, a proper
08:48.060 - 08:54.140:  separation of the legal system and politics? It is still very damaging. I would say for
08:54.140 - 08:59.360:  President Petro, politically, of course, the central allegation is that his presidential campaign
08:59.380 - 09:05.320:  received the funds from illicit sources. Again, he has insisted that he had nothing to do with it
09:05.320 - 09:11.280:  personally. He says, but it is a very damaging accusation anyway for the president, and that's what
09:11.380 - 09:17.200:  his political rivals have been saying in the last few hours, that this president who had promised
09:17.200 - 09:22.680:  to bring corruption to an end in Colombia, and now he faces this very big scandal affecting
09:22.680 - 09:27.660:  his campaign and his immediate family. Luis Fajardo in Bogotá.
09:28.580 - 09:33.000:  The Kenyan government says it's ready to lead a multinational force to Haiti. Clashes between
09:33.000 - 09:37.880:  the police and criminal gangs have displaced tens of thousands of people in the troubled Caribbean
09:37.880 - 09:43.520:  nation with more details. Here's Richard Wheatley. Haiti has been in a political crisis since the
09:43.520 - 09:50.600:  assassination of President Juvna Moise in 2021. Gangs control around 80 percent of the capital,
09:50.600 - 09:56.740:  and violent crimes such as kidnappings and armed robbery are common. Earlier this month,
09:56.740 - 10:02.900:  the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the creation of a multinational force for Haiti.
10:03.740 - 10:08.640:  Now Kenya has offered to take the lead, offering a thousand police officers to help train local
10:08.640 - 10:13.880:  law enforcement. The Kenyan foreign minister said it would be part of their plan to stand in
10:13.880 - 10:19.540:  solidarity with people of African descent across the world. The mission is subject to a mandate
10:19.540 - 10:24.300:  from the UN Security Council and formal authorization from the Kenyan authorities.
10:25.340 - 10:29.620:  Richard Wheatley. An Iranian official in charge of enforcing religious
10:29.620 - 10:34.400:  codes of conduct in one of the country's provinces has been dismissed, pending investigation
10:34.400 - 10:40.320:  into a sex video that purports to show him having sex with another man in his office. The video
10:40.320 - 10:44.900:  has been widely shared on social media in Iran. Its authenticity hasn't been confirmed.
10:44.900 - 10:51.520:  So who is the man at the centre of this story? Roca Asadi from the BBC's Persian Service has
10:51.520 - 10:57.200:  been speaking to Paul Henley. His name is Reza Sakati. He is the director of the government
10:57.200 - 11:05.140:  Office of Culture and Islamic Guidance in a Northern province of Iran called Gilan. His job is to
11:05.140 - 11:13.480:  promote Islamic ideology, promote hijab. And homosexuality is illegal in Iran. The charge if this
11:13.480 - 11:19.640:  is the man in the video that we're talking about and it has not been proven, obviously the charges
11:19.640 - 11:26.900:  of hypocrisy, is it? Yes, that's right. It can be punishable by death by the Sharia law. That's
11:26.900 - 11:33.100:  why many users on social media are angry because they think that the officials are treated
11:33.960 - 11:40.520:  differently comparing to other people who are accused with crimes relating to homosexuality.
11:41.080 - 11:48.500:  The video, it's showing explicit footage of two men having sex. But the faces of two men are not
11:48.500 - 11:56.020:  that much recognisable. Saying that the office itself, many people been into that office and they
11:56.020 - 12:03.040:  say that this is the office of this person and access to this office is not that easy. But all in
12:03.040 - 12:08.200:  all, we cannot say for sure that's the same person on the video. And we don't know how this video
12:08.200 - 12:14.700:  has come to public light. We know that first time it's been published by Gilan Radio Telegram channel,
12:14.700 - 12:21.100:  Telegram is a popular social platform in Iran and we had report that the manager of Radio Gilan
12:21.140 - 12:26.680:  was arrested after publishing this video. What's been official reaction? Officials at first
12:26.720 - 12:33.160:  state silence and after a while when it was widely circulating and everyone making comments,
12:33.160 - 12:39.200:  they said that the person accused has been suspended and they are going to investigate it
12:39.200 - 12:45.000:  thoroughly. Have there been cases like this before? Not at this level and not with the footage
12:45.140 - 12:51.900:  but we have cases of religious figures who are close to the government has been accused of
12:51.900 - 12:59.540:  assaults and rape of young boys and in some cases their profiles were just closed and all their
12:59.540 - 13:04.740:  accusation were dismissed. Clearly it's a big enough story that it can no longer be ignored by the
13:04.740 - 13:09.600:  authorities. It's a very difficult position for the authorities because if it's proven, if they
13:09.600 - 13:15.620:  say yes, this is the same person, then it is punishable by death. Many people in Iran in the
13:15.620 - 13:22.420:  past has been hanged because of their homosexuality. So it's going to be very difficult for the
13:22.820 - 13:28.280:  officials. They either have to deny it and if they approve that this really happened,
13:28.340 - 13:31.080:  they have to make a sentence.
13:31.140 - 13:37.540:  Roca Asadi from the BBC's Persian Service. African and Caribbean countries have been meeting
13:37.540 - 13:42.660:  in Barbados to discuss a collective strategy to seek reparations for the Atlantic slave trade.
13:42.660 - 13:48.600:  It included members of the African Union and the Caribbean Community, Political and Economy Union
13:48.600 - 13:53.360:  or Caracom. A statement said it marks the beginning of an intercontinental campaign to secure
13:53.360 - 13:59.520:  compensation and other reparations for the descendants of slaves. Andrew Peach heard more from the
13:59.520 - 14:05.680:  Pan-Africanist and Human Rights activist lawyer Brian Caguro. It's in the context of slavery,
14:05.680 - 14:12.100:  colonialism, appartments and ongoing problems such as climate-related harm.
14:12.480 - 14:16.720:  And we've got representatives from African countries, representatives from the Caribbean
14:17.380 - 14:21.180:  coming together. What is the nature of the conversation they'll be having with each other?
14:21.660 - 14:27.180:  So the African Union heads of states pass the resolution in their January meeting
14:27.760 - 14:32.480:  that the permanent representative council, which is Rambasada's representing countries in
14:32.480 - 14:40.460:  Addisababa, should constitute a study for the Caracom region to the Caribbean and specifically
14:40.460 - 14:47.480:  Barbados, because Caracom has come up with 10 points of reparations, action plan or plan,
14:47.880 - 14:49.920:  looking at slavery, looking at colonialism.
14:51.020 - 14:54.980:  And as this conversation goes far as talking about amounts of money?
14:55.440 - 14:59.160:  No, no, remember reparations. It's much broader than the question of money.
14:59.360 - 15:04.160:  But there is an insistent from a lot of the communities that are directly affected,
15:04.640 - 15:10.300:  that the type of financing should look also at the repair, because the harm that most countries
15:10.300 - 15:15.860:  that are vulnerable communities are suffering was caused elsewhere by consumption in the
15:15.860 - 15:21.800:  more industrialized countries. But it should also be assurance, type finance, that whether or not
15:22.180 - 15:26.740:  you repair these contingencies are going to happen. So you know, that finance that enables
15:26.740 - 15:31.280:  countries to respond. From the way you describe it, it says that it could be a very long process.
15:31.680 - 15:37.680:  It's been 600 years long, and for some countries 100 years long, this is the time of independence.
15:37.680 - 15:42.900:  I think we're in a global moment where the only crisis and in particular climate crisis,
15:43.320 - 15:47.040:  but don't forget that in the current conjecture where the world is talking about
15:47.040 - 15:52.620:  really transition or just transition, that most often minerals that are required, the critical
15:52.620 - 15:57.400:  minerals for that transition are found in countries that are also subject to colonialism
15:57.920 - 16:03.540:  or conspiracies that were subjected to the slave trade and et cetera. So the idea is that you
16:03.540 - 16:09.720:  don't end up with a transition that penalizes and gets victims to pay doubly by having to borrow
16:09.720 - 16:15.100:  money to adjust or to mitigate the harm. It's interesting you link it to climate issues, Brian,
16:15.100 - 16:20.280:  because I guess some listeners around the world might say climate issues cost of living pressures
16:20.280 - 16:25.240:  that so many countries are experiencing at the moment are not more important, but more urgent
16:25.240 - 16:31.200:  issues for focus right now. And look, the challenge with how the world approaches issues that
16:31.200 - 16:36.460:  attract black people, opera descendants, and African society is this assumption that they can
16:36.460 - 16:41.420:  always be postponed, that the risk for these other people and more age it. So this conversation
16:41.420 - 16:47.060:  needs about those who will come from African countries, from the Caribbean, from opera descendant
16:47.060 - 16:52.560:  communities, African communities, saying we do maintain the world after all we represent more than
16:52.560 - 16:59.000:  30% of the global population, we are grossly underrepresented and it always seems that anything
16:59.000 - 17:05.180:  that affects us is in the parking lot as superseded by other concern, but it's about time we
17:05.180 - 17:10.460:  collectively are confidently assets that we're important, we matter to ourselves Chris and we matter
17:10.820 - 17:15.520:  to how the world deals with the public crisis, we're not just incidental to the solutions.
17:16.320 - 17:18.060:  Human Rights Law at Brian Cagaro.
17:20.900 - 17:25.300:  Still to come in the Global News Podcast. As you start to register dogs,
17:25.300 - 17:31.400:  you're going to see a 70% reduction waste on the street right out of the gate and then once
17:31.400 - 17:38.000:  somebody gets fined and everybody else knows the problem disappears. Could a K9 DNA database
17:38.020 - 17:41.880:  company help a German mayor stamp on the problem a dog poop?
17:49.880 - 17:54.480:  An explosion at a fireworks warehouse in southern Thailand has killed at least 9 people,
17:54.480 - 17:58.460:  including three children. Officials said that more than 100 others were injured,
17:58.460 - 18:03.380:  the blast caused widespread destruction as our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head
18:03.380 - 18:08.760:  reports from Thailand. Residents in the border town of Somai Golok described hearing a huge
18:08.760 - 18:14.400:  explosion which shook buildings, shattered windows and collapsed some roofs, sending a massive
18:14.400 - 18:19.840:  plume of smoke into the air. Video taken after the explosion showed many buildings ablaze,
18:19.840 - 18:25.100:  some completely destroyed, and a substantial area of the town close to the river which divides
18:25.100 - 18:30.660:  Thailand from Malaysia in ruins. The local governor said the cause of the explosion was a technical
18:30.660 - 18:37.100:  error by welders working on a warehouse where fireworks were stored. Accidents involving fireworks
18:37.100 - 18:41.640:  which are commonly used in Southeast Asia to commemorate big events are not unusual.
18:42.460 - 18:47.920:  And despite public pressure to improve safety, Thailand still has a poor record of accidents on
18:47.920 - 18:53.060:  its road's construction sites and in the workplace. Jonathan Head in Bangkok.
18:54.220 - 18:58.900:  Poland has accused Russia's Wagner mercenary group of waging what Warsaw has described as a
18:58.900 - 19:04.660:  hybrid war against the country. The Prime Minister Maters Morovetsky claimed that part of this
19:04.660 - 19:10.020:  involved illegal migrants being brought into Poland and Lithuania by mercenaries in neighboring
19:10.020 - 19:18.780:  Belarus. Certainly this is a step towards a hybrid attack on Polish territory in order to
19:18.780 - 19:24.980:  destabilize the country. Presurably they will also try to infiltrate Poland pretending to be
19:24.980 - 19:32.080:  illegal immigrants and this creates additional risks. I heard more about the claims of a hybrid war
19:32.080 - 19:38.320:  from our correspondent in Warsaw, Adam Eastern. What they mean by that is they accuse Belarus
19:38.320 - 19:46.660:  and Russia of trying to destabilize the European Union by helping people migrants from many Asian
19:46.660 - 19:54.140:  and many African countries to fly to Belarus on a tourist visa and then helping them cross illegally
19:54.140 - 19:59.520:  over the Lithuanian and Polish borders into the European Union. And what place does Wagner
19:59.520 - 20:05.100:  have in this? Poland's Prime Minister Maters Morovetsky during a news conference said that his
20:05.100 - 20:12.440:  government had information that around 100 mercenaries from the Wagner group had moved closer to
20:12.440 - 20:19.120:  the Polish border and the Lithuanian border simultaneously north-western Belarus and that he
20:19.120 - 20:26.480:  believed that these mercenaries will try and help illegal migrants enter Poland. He said they
20:26.480 - 20:32.800:  would be disguised probably as Belarusian border guards and possibly that they would also
20:32.820 - 20:38.780:  pretend to be illegal migrants themselves and enter the European Union that way.
20:39.120 - 20:45.000:  He didn't say where the information had come from but certainly on Friday there was a media
20:45.000 - 20:52.640:  report which said very similar things to what he was saying. So what would be motivating the
20:52.640 - 20:58.980:  Belarusians and Wagner to do this? If you believe the European Union and the Polish and Lithuanian
20:58.980 - 21:06.180:  story that Belarus and Russia are using this new migration route as a way to destabilize these
21:06.180 - 21:11.440:  countries, these frontier countries. On the other hand the opposition in Poland has said that
21:11.580 - 21:16.440:  essentially the Polish government is trying to scare people. We've got elections in Poland in
21:16.440 - 21:22.500:  October and the opposition say that the government wants to use the issue of security and the
21:22.500 - 21:28.940:  threats and is playing up how they are protecting Polish security especially on the border
21:29.540 - 21:37.340:  to essentially win votes in that upcoming election. Adam Eastern in Warsaw. In the face of the
21:37.340 - 21:42.560:  global energy crisis and the growing severity of climate change, Emmanuel Macron managed to
21:42.560 - 21:48.220:  pull off something miraculous last year. The French president executed a remarkable U-turn by
21:48.220 - 21:53.900:  swapping a plan to close a number of nuclear reactors for a plan to build new ones. The country
21:53.900 - 21:59.560:  has been a leader in atomic energy for decades and construction is about to begin on six new reactors
21:59.560 - 22:05.520:  known as EPRs. Nuclear power is a divisive issue because of environmental concerns and lingering
22:05.520 - 22:11.420:  memories of disasters in Chernobyl and Fukushima. But as John Lawrence reports from the Rome Valley,
22:11.780 - 22:16.180:  many people have embraced the decision to increase the number of reactor facilities.
22:18.460 - 22:25.740:  San Voulba, its shady plain trees, its cooling pigeons, and its nuclear reactors. This small sunny
22:25.740 - 22:31.740:  southern French town already has four of France's 56 atomic power stations at a site called
22:31.800 - 22:36.540:  Bujé, and its inhabitants are very much looking forward to having two more.
22:41.560 - 22:46.640:  I've always been pro-Nuclear. It provides us with electricity while saving us from having to
22:46.640 - 22:53.300:  import it. That was President of all's idea when he decided to make us a nuclear power in the 60s,
22:53.780 - 22:56.240:  and San Voulba would never have developed to be without it.
22:59.200 - 23:03.620:  Three hours down the Rhone River, it's the same story. A pretty medieval town called
23:03.640 - 23:10.300:  Sample Troichato, which has the Trikastan power plants, and a uranium enrichment facility
23:10.300 - 23:16.580:  to boot. The largest nuclear complex in Europe. They've also got four reactors, but also felt that
23:16.580 - 23:18.860:  six would be just 50 percent better.
23:19.460 - 23:28.120:  I'm 72, and nothing bad has happened with this nuclear reactor so far, so I am inclined to
23:28.120 - 23:33.540:  trust that we are relatively well protected when it comes to the nuclear risk. And at the same
23:33.540 - 23:40.620:  time, it is clear that France needs these EPRs because we need electricity. The mayor of Sample
23:40.620 - 23:46.620:  Troichato, Jean-Michel Catalinoire, used to work in the nuclear industry. Trikastan's reactors
23:46.660 - 23:52.700:  were among France's first built in the 1970s. Their working lives have just been extended 10 years,
23:53.060 - 23:58.200:  and now won't be decommissioned till the 2030s to the general relief of the population.
24:02.740 - 24:08.260:  At least one person per family works in the nuclear industry around here. Around 12,000
24:08.260 - 24:14.380:  jobs depend on it. The financial benefits for the town are considerable, and explain why we have
24:14.380 - 24:19.760:  excellent facilities, and very low local taxes. But it's not just money. The energy crisis
24:19.760 - 24:25.200:  sparked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the growing realization that massive supplies of
24:25.200 - 24:30.480:  zero CO2 electricity might actually make nuclear power a good thing for the environment,
24:31.200 - 24:37.660:  have changed minds about atomic energy in France as a whole. A recent poll shows the number of
24:37.660 - 24:43.100:  French people with a positive view of nuclear power has almost doubled from 34 percent to 60 percent
24:43.100 - 24:49.800:  since 2019. Green Party councillor Alban Kolan, member of a collective opposed to building
24:49.800 - 24:58.460:  new nuclear reactors, says this is because of media distortion. Macron is afraid of
24:58.460 - 25:03.740:  public opposition to nuclear and has created media hype to make people believe that we can do
25:03.740 - 25:08.940:  without it. But this ignores alternative scenarios suggested by electricity transmission
25:08.940 - 25:13.140:  network that emphasise energy, sobriety, and energy efficiency.
25:13.800 - 25:18.720:  Madame Kolan's association has now lodged an appeal against the decision to build the new reactors
25:18.720 - 25:25.540:  at Bouger. But hers has become a minority opinion in France. The old red and yellow nuclear
25:25.540 - 25:31.620:  no-merci bumper stickers have pretty much disappeared. And near Bouger and Trichestin, at least,
25:31.680 - 25:34.960:  they be up for a new one. Nuclear waste of you play.
25:35.680 - 25:41.060:  John Lawrence and reporting. New figures released by the Indian government show the estimated
25:41.060 - 25:46.840:  wild tiger population in the country is growing by more than 6 percent a year. India is home to about
25:46.840 - 25:52.480:  three quarters of the world's wild tigers, and it counts them every four years. The latest census
25:52.480 - 25:58.840:  recorded more than 3,600. They shan dodgy the senior Asia director for the Wildlife Charity
25:58.840 - 26:02.320:  WWF explained what had led to the turnaround in numbers.
26:02.880 - 26:08.120:  I think it's a reflection of immense political will and commitment, great leadership, and also
26:08.120 - 26:12.940:  I think the biggest one is really people on the ground who are working on a day-to-day basis in
26:12.940 - 26:18.240:  terms of protecting tigers and conserving its habitat. And the other important element aspect
26:18.240 - 26:22.340:  to this is sort of community participation. I think it's very important to work with the local
26:22.340 - 26:26.500:  communities and get their ownership, get their confidence in working together in protecting
26:26.500 - 26:31.280:  tigers and their habitat and their prey as well. With more details is our South Asia,
26:31.280 - 26:37.240:  regional editor and parason at erosion. India once had tens of thousands of tigers, but
26:37.240 - 26:42.940:  British and Indian nobility and officials hunted the animals during the colonial period,
26:43.420 - 26:48.240:  deforestation, poaching and human encroachment also devastated the population.
26:48.820 - 26:54.780:  The tiger conservation program started when it plummeted to less than 2,000 in the 1970s.
26:55.160 - 27:00.020:  Now, the rising numbers are a conservation success, but not without controversy.
27:00.640 - 27:06.160:  With more tigers competing for the same resources, some animals venture outside protected
27:06.160 - 27:11.540:  nature reserves, looking for food, bringing them into conflict with people in nearby villages.
27:12.440 - 27:18.440:  Ambarasan at erosion. A German mayor has suggested that all dog owners in a town
27:18.440 - 27:23.860:  nick alone should register their dogs DNA on a central database so that owners who don't pick
27:23.860 - 27:29.660:  up their dog mess could be caught and find. Sometimes in Ireland, France, Italy and Spain and
27:29.660 - 27:36.080:  Israel already use or are planning to use dog DNA-based stool tracking, and it's also being used
27:36.080 - 27:42.480:  in parts of Britain and the US, but does it work? The American company Puprints certainly think so
27:42.480 - 27:47.960:  as its ad suggests. Here's the scoop on solving your number two problem, Puprints.
27:48.720 - 27:52.760:  Our patented science uses DNA to keep grounds clean and families healthy.
27:54.660 - 27:59.960:  It starts with a simple swab. Bottom line, we're the best way to solve your stinky problem.
28:00.760 - 28:06.960:  Jay Rettinger is the CEO of BioPet Laboratories, which runs Puprints from Knoxville, Tennessee.
28:06.960 - 28:11.200:  He told Caroline Wyatt about his company's dog DNA service.
28:11.780 - 28:18.300:  We register dogs DNA using a simple cheap swab, and then we have a proprietary waste collection kit
28:18.500 - 28:24.440:  that our customers and cities can use to where they find unscooked dog mess on the ground.
28:24.440 - 28:30.360:  They take a small sample, they send it to us. We process that sample and extract DNA from it,
28:30.580 - 28:33.240:  run it in our database, and tell them who did not pick up.
28:33.360 - 28:37.360:  And who keeps a log of the DNA doggy database?
28:37.360 - 28:42.700:  We do, and we call it our DNA world pet registry. We have it, but the municipalities,
28:42.980 - 28:50.120:  our customers, they have access and manage that database for their residents and pet owners.
28:50.320 - 28:57.060:  We've got over 7,000 customers across seven countries. A majority of our business is in the US,
28:57.320 - 29:03.600:  and a majority of our business is made up of private landlords, rental companies, but internationally,
29:03.660 - 29:09.940:  we do have a growing municipality business where more and more cities are faced with how do we
29:09.940 - 29:13.140:  maintain and protect our citizens and keep our streets cleaned?
29:13.460 - 29:18.640:  Do you also sometimes get individuals who want to track down bad owners in their area?
29:18.800 - 29:23.440:  It's funny, we get calls every day on individuals who want to know who less mess in their yard,
29:23.440 - 29:28.700:  but we stay away from those. We want to make sure that all samples we receive are obtained
29:28.700 - 29:34.540:  lawfully. Chain of custody is very important for us. We don't always know if your neighbor gave you
29:34.540 - 29:36.760:  permission to hop the fence and swap their dog.
29:37.000 - 29:40.760:  And how difficult is it to test dog poo against a database?
29:41.100 - 29:46.160:  We've perfected the process and because the volume in which we process, we're able to do it really
29:46.160 - 29:51.080:  quick, but it is probably at several hours per way sample.
29:51.560 - 29:57.960:  And can you be 100% sure that a specific dog is the perpetrator or perhaps the pooped
29:57.960 - 30:02.640:  traitor? I mean, what if it has got a brother or a sister or a half brother or a half sister
30:02.640 - 30:08.700:  that shares much of the same doggy DNA? We can be definitive that that is that specific dog.
30:08.980 - 30:13.520:  We use markers that differentiate that dog from any other dog in the world, including
30:13.520 - 30:18.900:  litter mates. The results that our customers experience are phenomenal. On average, we see
30:18.900 - 30:26.040:  96% reduction in waste. As you start to register dogs, you're going to see a 70% reduction
30:26.060 - 30:32.020:  waste on the street right out of the gate. And then once somebody gets fined and everybody else
30:32.020 - 30:35.140:  knows accountability is there, the problem disappears.
30:35.960 - 30:38.060:  Jay Rhett and Jess speaking to Caroline Wyatt.
30:41.360 - 30:46.120:  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new addition of the global news podcast
30:46.120 - 30:50.940:  at the same time tomorrow. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
30:51.560 - 30:58.280:  you can send us an email. The address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on
30:58.280 - 31:04.880:  Twitter at globalnewspod. This addition was mixed by Chesney Forks Porter and the producer
31:04.880 - 31:11.360:  was Emma Joseph, the editor. It's Karen Martin. I'm Alex Ritson until next time. Goodbye.
