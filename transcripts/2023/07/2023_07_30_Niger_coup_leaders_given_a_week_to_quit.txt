00:49.100 - 00:52.480:  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
00:55.260 - 01:01.060:  I'm Alex Ritson, and in the early hours of Monday, the 31st of July, these are our main stories.
01:01.580 - 01:06.580:  West African states give Niger's co-leaders a week to restore civilian rule or face possible
01:06.580 - 01:12.220:  intervention. At least 44 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded in what's
01:12.220 - 01:15.020:  thought to be a suicide bomb attack in northwestern Pakistan.
01:15.640 - 01:21.600:  And the Afghan Taliban publicly burn confiscated musical instruments saying they cause moral corruption.
01:25.060 - 01:30.020:  Also in this podcast, Ukraine's president says the war is gradually coming home to Russia
01:30.020 - 01:36.180:  after the latest drone attack on Moscow. And so the stairwell we are walking down is almost
01:36.620 - 01:41.980:  identical to the one that's on sale. The sellers are saying is that this could become a living space,
01:42.160 - 01:47.740:  an office space somewhere to hang out. Could this be the stairway to a heavenly London home?
01:52.380 - 01:57.640:  We start in Niger, where co-leaders were told on Sunday that they have one week to hand back
01:57.640 - 02:02.260:  power to the president. They deposed last week. The demand was made by the regional block of
02:02.260 - 02:08.340:  15 West African states, known as ECOWAS, which is threatening to use force unless Muhammad Basoum
02:08.340 - 02:14.160:  is reinstated. ECOWAS also imposed economic and travel sanctions on the new military leaders
02:14.160 - 02:19.760:  in Niger, one of the world's poorest countries. I asked Africa, regional editor, Richard Hamilton,
02:19.760 - 02:26.960:  whether this tough talk from ECOWAS would work. This is an unusually tough response from ECOWAS.
02:27.040 - 02:33.440:  They've not done that in previous coups in Marley and Burkina Faso. And they did create a regional
02:33.440 - 02:40.980:  security force so they could go in and actually take military action. They've imposed a no-fly zone,
02:40.980 - 02:47.320:  they've closed borders. And though many other West African countries have turned towards the
02:47.320 - 02:54.040:  military, Niger was actually relatively stable under President Basoum. But thousands of people
02:54.040 - 03:00.980:  protested in Niamay outside the French embassy and they were brandishing pro-Russian slogans and
03:00.980 - 03:08.280:  placards and ripped out the French embassy plaques. So it's not clear if it's like a manufactured
03:08.280 - 03:14.160:  demonstration. It doesn't seem to be spontaneous but this is what some people have been saying
03:14.160 - 03:22.280:  against ECOWAS. During 12 years nothing has changed so this is why we took to the straits and
03:22.280 - 03:27.900:  decided to kick the president out. The West African block ECOWAS better not try and interfere
03:27.900 - 03:34.820:  on this process. Should the West African block ECOWAS come and intervene militarily,
03:35.360 - 03:39.560:  that would simply be on the wrong side of history. You would even steer away from their core
03:39.560 - 03:46.440:  mission which is to create a stable environment for the whole region to grow. Richard, why is Niger
03:46.440 - 03:52.620:  significant? What's it stake here? Well it's the sort of final domino in what the New York Times
03:52.620 - 03:59.620:  journalist calls the longest corridor of military rule on earth because six countries in Africa
03:59.620 - 04:06.840:  from Sudan on the east coast to Guinea on the west coast spanning 5,600 kilometers are now under
04:06.840 - 04:13.160:  military rule and one academic at Oxford University said that he was really worried that the Sahel
04:13.160 - 04:21.240:  region of Africa is going into meltdown and jihadists are growing in strength and in this vacuum
04:21.300 - 04:27.300:  Russia seems to be stepping in and this is a sentiment that Niger's ambassador to Washington,
04:27.300 - 04:34.240:  Kiari, Liment, and Guiri also expressed. What I expect from ECOWAS is to do everything
04:34.240 - 04:41.840:  possible to make the school fail. I am worried because I don't want to see my country go the way
04:41.840 - 04:49.660:  of being ruled by mercenaries. And the United States is also extremely worried. They have 1,100
04:49.660 - 04:56.540:  troops there as well as drone bases. They're worried about the increasing instability from jihadists
04:56.580 - 05:02.320:  and the void being filled by Russia. And on top of that, Niger produces uranium which of course
05:02.320 - 05:08.600:  can be used for nuclear energy and nuclear weapons as well. Richard Hamilton sitting in on the
05:08.600 - 05:14.960:  ECOWAS meeting was Dr Leonardo Santos Samayo. He's the recently appointed special representative of
05:14.960 - 05:20.120:  the UN Security General for West Africa and the Sahel. Julian Marshall asked him why he thought
05:20.120 - 05:25.460:  ECOWAS had taken such decisive action against Niger. Well, since I've changed it now,
05:25.460 - 05:31.320:  the intolerance against a legal change of government is as grown. Why wasn't a similar tactic
05:31.320 - 05:36.580:  pursued in Mali? When things happen in Mali, the situation of the region was different. Now
05:36.580 - 05:43.380:  we have a new leadership in the region and the ECOWAS, we have Nigeria and the feeling was that
05:43.860 - 05:51.700:  Nigeria was somehow less dynamic in the regional affairs. That situation now is changing with the
05:51.700 - 05:57.420:  new president, the noble. And therefore, the region feels more stronger to fight the
05:57.420 - 06:05.780:  effort in the region. And was weighing on the minds of the ECOWAS leaders, the importance of
06:05.780 - 06:12.240:  Niger in fighting jihadism in the region? Oh, yes, of course. Niger is playing a key role.
06:12.440 - 06:18.020:  That's where some of the joint forces are concentrated to fight terrorism. So if Niger
06:18.020 - 06:23.760:  stopped playing this role, this will give more leeway to terrorism to expand in the region.
06:23.940 - 06:27.320:  And that expansion of terrorism is a matter of concern in the region.
06:27.620 - 06:34.960:  Military intervention must be something that ECOWAS is anxious to avoid. It has happened before,
06:34.960 - 06:41.360:  has it not in Gambia and Liberia, but it's not a decision to be taken lightly, is it?
06:41.420 - 06:47.280:  It's not that I don't want to speak on behalf of ECOWAS, but my view is that after the announcement
06:47.280 - 06:53.420:  of these measures, maybe other steps will follow. Such as? Maybe even to reach out to negotiate with
06:53.420 - 06:58.720:  them. The way that means to reinstall the legitimate government. By understanding it, that this
06:58.720 - 07:04.820:  will not be business as usual. Dr Leonardo Santos Simeio, the special representative of the UN
07:04.820 - 07:11.040:  Security General for West Africa and the Sahel. A rally held by an Islamist party in
07:11.040 - 07:16.540:  northwest Pakistan has seen at least 44 people killed and wounded more than 100 in what police
07:16.540 - 07:21.980:  attentively saying was a suicide blast. The party is a partner in Pakistan's governing coalition.
07:21.980 - 07:27.920:  I got the latest from our Pakistan correspondent, Carrie Davis. We've been able to speak to some
07:27.920 - 07:32.380:  people who were either on the scene when the explosion happened or were there very shortly
07:32.380 - 07:36.720:  afterwards and the sort of things they've been talking about is the level of destruction and chaos
07:36.720 - 07:42.440:  and the force of the blast. We were able to speak to one of the rallies organizers, Imran Mahir,
07:42.440 - 07:47.020:  who was on stage at the time when this happened and has told us that several people around him
07:47.540 - 07:52.960:  died during that explosion. He's not entirely certain why he survived, but this is what he said when
07:52.960 - 07:56.760:  I asked him about what he remembered from the moment of the explosion and afterwards.
07:57.780 - 08:03.320:  It was all injured people around, all dead bodies and flesh. It was like Doomsday,
08:03.620 - 08:09.520:  local people tried to help the injured. There were not enough ambulances, so people were taking
08:09.520 - 08:14.720:  their own cars and Carrie people are being buried already. Yes, Alex, we've already seen
08:14.720 - 08:20.680:  images of hundreds of people turning up to funerals of those who died in this explosion.
08:20.680 - 08:24.700:  We know that earlier on today the police were still trying to identify some of
08:25.240 - 08:29.460:  those who had died and we understand now that they've had to do that through their clothes or
08:29.460 - 08:33.560:  their shoes simply because of the force of the blast. It was just too difficult to be able to
08:33.560 - 08:38.280:  identify some of those people who had lost their lives. Carrie, this was an attack on a political
08:38.280 - 08:44.580:  rally by an Islamist party. What was behind this? It's really difficult at this stage to identify
08:44.580 - 08:47.700:  there. There have been plenty of different theories that have been circulating online
08:48.120 - 08:52.820:  about who could be behind it. But as yet, firstly, the police haven't completely confirmed that this
08:52.820 - 08:59.760:  is a suicide bomber. And in terms of who could be behind it, no group has claimed responsibility
08:59.840 - 09:05.740:  as yet. And in fact, some factions of the Pakistani Taliban have already distanced themselves and
09:05.740 - 09:11.260:  denied that they were involved. But of course, the backdrop is the elections expected to be happening
09:11.260 - 09:16.660:  later on this year, most likely in the autumn. And the concerns are that we are at this point
09:16.660 - 09:21.420:  in the year without even a set date for the general elections. And we are seeing political rallies
09:21.860 - 09:26.140:  being targeted. So the concern is what might be in store for Pakistan in the next few months.
09:26.620 - 09:32.940:  Carrie Davis in Islamabad. Teleban officials in Afghanistan say they've confiscated and
09:32.940 - 09:38.260:  burned musical instruments and equipment in the western province of Harat. The Ministry of
09:38.260 - 09:43.500:  the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice said the performance of music contributed to
09:43.500 - 09:48.580:  moral corruption and led young people astray. It's the latest in a series of crackdowns on
09:48.580 - 09:54.340:  freedom of expression in the country as Sanjay Deskrupta reports. So far, it's been Afghan women
09:54.340 - 09:59.140:  who have borne the brunt of the Taliban's austere, worthless, efficient, of an Islamic society.
09:59.140 - 10:05.440:  Now, it's the turn of music makers. In Harat on Saturday, thousands of dollars worth of confiscated
10:05.440 - 10:11.360:  musical gear went up in smoke. A guitar, two other stringed instruments, a harmonium drums, amplifiers,
10:11.360 - 10:18.080:  speakers. For local Taliban officials, music leads to moral corruption. So Harat famed
10:18.080 - 10:24.340:  historically as a great center of Islamic art and culture, must hear no music. Only the sound
10:24.340 - 10:32.080:  of silence. Sanjay Deskrupta. Last week, we reported briefly on a landmark hearing by a US
10:32.080 - 10:39.880:  Congressional Committee into unidentified anomalous phenomenon, UAPs, known more colloquially as UFOs.
10:39.920 - 10:44.740:  It was the most serious acknowledgement yet that mysterious sightings warranted scrutiny
10:44.740 - 10:50.040:  at the highest levels of government. One of three key witnesses was ex-intelligence officer
10:50.040 - 10:56.820:  turned whistleblower David Grush, who claimed the US government had intact and partially intact
10:57.260 - 11:02.940:  alien vehicles. He also alleged that information on UAPs was being illegally withheld from
11:02.940 - 11:08.540:  Congress. Here is one of his responses to a question from the Republican Congresswoman Nancy
11:08.540 - 11:14.140:  Mace. If you believe we have crashed craft, do we have the bodies of the pilots who piloted
11:14.140 - 11:18.220:  this craft? Biologics came with some of these recoveries. Yeah.
11:19.240 - 11:21.820:  Were they, I guess, human or non-human biologics?
11:23.040 - 11:26.940:  Non-human and that was the assessment of people which acknowledge on the program I talked to
11:26.940 - 11:31.960:  that are currently still on the program. Leslie Kern has written about the subject in the
11:31.960 - 11:37.540:  New York Times and has spoken to David Grush at length about his experiences. She told the BBC's
11:37.540 - 11:43.360:  Jim Nockity about the significance of last week's hearing. We have never had a hearing involving
11:43.360 - 11:49.860:  witnesses like this, but ones of this caliber, it's absolutely historic that we have members of
11:49.860 - 11:55.160:  Congress there asking unimpeachable witnesses, given their credentials and their knowledge,
11:55.160 - 12:02.280:  topics about UFOs. David Grush was the witness who gave us, I suppose, the most dramatic evidence.
12:02.340 - 12:07.620:  Let's just hear one of the things he said now. Due to my extensive executive level intelligence
12:07.620 - 12:13.400:  support duties, I was cleared to literally all relevant departments and in a position of
12:13.400 - 12:19.600:  extreme trust both in my military and civilian capacities. I was informed in the course of my
12:19.600 - 12:26.200:  official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program.
12:26.500 - 12:32.220:  By any standards, that's a remarkable statement. Let me ask you the blunt question. They don't reflect
12:32.260 - 12:39.160:  something that he has seen personally. Why should we believe him? I've spoken to him at great length
12:39.160 - 12:43.960:  and when I broke the story with my colleague Ralph Blumenthal of David Grush, which we did about
12:43.960 - 12:49.300:  two months ago, we did discuss with him at length the question of crash retrieved objects,
12:49.300 - 12:54.700:  which he says are of non-human origin. Not only have I spoken to him about this, but to others
12:54.700 - 12:59.860:  off the record, who have told me exactly the same thing. As Grush stated at the hearing, he
12:59.860 - 13:05.360:  has spoken to dozens of very highly placed intelligence officials and people actually directly
13:05.360 - 13:10.520:  involved with the programs that possess these objects. That is what led him to come forward. He
13:10.520 - 13:14.800:  had enough information from others to believe that this was the case. One of the remarkable things
13:14.800 - 13:20.680:  about the hearing was how lucky it was. It seemed that all the members of the house who were sitting
13:20.680 - 13:29.520:  there were anxious to appear reasonable, skeptical, factual, and calm rather than performing in a
13:29.520 - 13:35.000:  way that would lead people to think about conspiracies and little green man and all these things.
13:35.060 - 13:39.760:  They wanted to make this a very sober hearing, didn't they?
13:40.060 - 13:45.280:  Absolutely. I was in the room. Jim and I definitely felt that was the mood there. It was very sober.
13:45.280 - 13:51.140:  It was also a level of excitement in that room, a high attention that was being paid to everything.
13:51.180 - 13:55.260:  This felt like a moment of history and I think everyone in the room realized that.
13:55.680 - 14:02.400:  Leslie Kern speaking to Jim Nockety. Nero may have been emperor of Rome, but his heart lay
14:02.400 - 14:08.840:  with the theatre. Ruelling between 54 and 68 AD, he became famous for his outrageous behaviour,
14:09.340 - 14:14.180:  reportedly fiddling while Rome burned. Perhaps though, he was just unsuited to the job,
14:14.180 - 14:18.760:  spending most of his time acting and playing music. The theatre he used while it was written
14:18.760 - 14:24.380:  about in old texts had never been found. Until now, Terry Egan has the details.
14:25.200 - 14:31.660:  Nero's theatre was a conundrum for many. Written about several times, its exact location was
14:31.660 - 14:38.800:  unknown. In fact, only some glass chalices from the period had ever been turned up. Until that is
14:38.800 - 14:44.540:  a new renovation project, digging up a palazzo leading to Saint Peter's Square near the
14:44.540 - 14:50.460:  Tyber River as part of plans for a new hotel, archaeologists found marble columns,
14:50.540 - 14:57.660:  storage rooms containing the remains of costumes and backdrops, as well as plaster decorated in gold
14:57.660 - 15:04.980:  leaf. There are signs of the kind of interest he had that ultimately made Nero Claudius Caesar
15:04.980 - 15:12.300:  Augustus such a bad emperor. He spent most of his time showing off on the stage as actor, poet,
15:12.300 - 15:19.380:  and musician, and ended up killing many of those closest to him, including his mother and his
15:19.380 - 15:25.980:  wife for disagreeing with him. And famously, Nero may well have been behind a fire that destroyed
15:25.980 - 15:32.480:  much of Rome. The myth of him playing a fiddle while it took place just symbolises how he was
15:32.480 - 15:39.540:  viewed. Nero was ultimately declared a public enemy and fleeing Rome was forced to kill himself,
15:39.880 - 15:47.120:  apparently commenting at the time, what an artist dies with me. It certainly all makes for a
15:47.120 - 15:53.520:  tale worthy of the stage, and experts say the discovery of his theatre may make that a reality.
15:54.320 - 15:59.720:  Either way, many of the pieces will end up in museums, while the ruins of the theatre
15:59.720 - 16:04.460:  will be catalogued and then re-buried. Terry Egan
16:08.040 - 16:10.600:  Still to come in the global news podcast.
16:17.380 - 16:20.860:  Could that be the sound of New Zealand's bird of the century?
16:27.800 - 16:33.400:  Russia's president Vladimir Putin has praised his naval forces at an annual parade in St. Petersburg.
16:33.940 - 16:37.160:  On a day when Moscow has been targeted by Ukrainian drones,
16:37.160 - 16:40.460:  our Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow.
16:41.120 - 16:45.100:  Russia's war in Ukraine has not gone at all according to the Kremlin's plan.
16:45.960 - 16:51.420:  Still, there's nothing like a giant parade to put a shine on things and create an image
16:51.860 - 16:52.720:  of military might.
16:58.440 - 17:05.200:  In St. Petersburg, Vladimir Putin sailed down the Nyevur River, congratulating Russian sailors on Navy Day.
17:11.120 - 17:16.700:  He reviewed a parade of warships and submarines and delivered an address about heroism,
17:17.200 - 17:18.860:  patriotism and power.
17:21.940 - 17:26.020:  Russia, he said, was constantly increasing the strength of its Navy.
17:26.900 - 17:30.740:  Thirty ships of different classes were being added to the fleet this year.
17:31.060 - 17:36.540:  Without referring directly to the war in Ukraine, President Putin praised Russian sailors
17:36.960 - 17:40.220:  for displaying true heroism and fighting valiantly.
17:41.500 - 17:44.180:  But the news from Moscow was less upbeat.
17:45.000 - 17:49.880:  Russia's defence ministry said that three Ukrainian drones had tried to attack the city
17:49.880 - 17:55.740:  early this morning. Two had crashed into the Moscow city office complex, a collection of
17:55.740 - 18:00.900:  skyscrapers that are home to companies, government ministries and residential apartments.
18:01.940 - 18:07.180:  Although no one was killed, the attack added to the general sense of instability here.
18:07.920 - 18:11.660:  Steve Rosenberg, well in response to those drone attacks on Moscow,
18:11.660 - 18:15.480:  Ukraine's President Zelensky warned that war was coming to Russia.
18:15.920 - 18:21.080:  Our correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse, told me more about the rhetoric being used by President
18:21.080 - 18:21.760:  Zelensky.
18:51.920 - 18:51.940:  Ukraine.
18:52.580 - 18:55.840:  And what I think he is doing is that he's not just addressing Vladimir Putin,
18:56.280 - 19:00.380:  but he's also trying to reach out to the Russian population where the majority of people
19:00.380 - 19:04.120:  believe the war is justified or at the very least they turn a blind eye.
19:04.120 - 19:07.780:  They don't ask questions and they place a great deal of trust in the country's leadership.
19:08.080 - 19:10.340:  But when are explosions in the capital city?
19:10.560 - 19:15.660:  When an airport has to be shut because of the danger, it might compel them to make a connection
19:15.700 - 19:18.840:  between what's happening close to home and what's happening in Ukraine.
19:18.840 - 19:22.720:  And when that happens, that makes Vladimir Putin's job all the more difficult
19:22.720 - 19:28.840:  as he tries to conscript more men for an invasion which is going far from perfect for him.
19:28.980 - 19:34.460:  Even if the confirmation is not official, the timing of what he says just so soon after
19:34.460 - 19:39.020:  these drone attacks on Moscow, it is effectively Ukraine saying we did this, isn't it?
19:39.500 - 19:44.540:  It's just short I think, but what's interesting about President Zelensky's administration is how
19:45.480 - 19:48.280:  effective they are at propaganda and at messaging.
19:48.280 - 19:54.440:  And I've seen a military animation video using his words from his speech saying the war is
19:54.440 - 19:59.740:  coming to Russia and it's got cartoon drones flying along a map out of Ukraine towards Russia.
20:00.200 - 20:05.080:  They've moved very quickly on his comments and I think that's been a trait throughout.
20:05.080 - 20:10.460:  Ukraine is trying to win hearts and minds around the world as it tries to secure long-term help,
20:10.460 - 20:13.260:  commitment as it hopes to prevail in this war.
20:13.800 - 20:20.660:  James Waterhouse in Kiev. The group of 21 opposition MPs in India has warned that if the
20:20.660 - 20:24.660:  ethnic conflict in the north-eastern state of Manadpur is not resolved soon,
20:25.140 - 20:29.680:  it could create security problems. It follows their two-day trip to assess the situation,
20:29.680 - 20:34.640:  amid ongoing violence in the state that borders Myanmar. The clashes between the dominant
20:34.640 - 20:40.400:  mities and the indigenous kooky communities have killed more than 140 people since May and
20:40.400 - 20:45.780:  displaced more than 50,000. There have also been harrowing reports of sexual violence against women.
20:46.100 - 20:51.340:  Member of parliament Kanemosi Karin Anidti described her visit to the camps to Julian Marshall.
20:52.100 - 20:54.320:  Their women have had to face sexual violence,
20:54.320 - 20:59.700:  harassment, and many lives have been lost on both sides. They are living in these
20:59.700 - 21:05.760:  makeshift places and people who are very hurt and feel led down. They've lost their homes,
21:05.760 - 21:12.200:  they've lost their lives and it's a forced piece which is there and still there are sporadic
21:12.200 - 21:18.140:  cases of violence and shooting going on. It is a very difficult situation there.
21:18.260 - 21:26.060:  Of course it was the image of a woman experiencing extreme sexual violence and humiliation,
21:26.060 - 21:33.160:  originally filmed back in May that triggered both Indian and indeed world attention
21:33.460 - 21:40.280:  on the situation in Manipur but you say that sexual violence is still a feature of what is happening
21:40.280 - 21:46.560:  there. There are many women who had to face sexual violence and harassment and we met these two
21:46.560 - 21:53.080:  women also and they feel really led down by the police force which they reached out to and asked
21:53.080 - 21:58.820:  for help. They did not help them and they want justice to whatever happened to them and especially
21:58.820 - 22:04.440:  the young woman. She saw her father and her younger brother being killed in front of her eyes.
22:04.900 - 22:11.120:  You talk about an uneasy piece. Are you saying that the dozens of members of the Indian security forces
22:11.120 - 22:15.780:  that have been deployed in Manipur have managed to restore some kind of order?
22:16.180 - 22:23.440:  Yes, some kind of order but still incidents are not completely stopped so there is nothing done
22:23.480 - 22:30.340:  for permanent peace and the government has not reached out to the leaders to ensure that there
22:30.340 - 22:34.140:  is some kind of peace talks and some solution which they can reach.
22:34.380 - 22:41.020:  The memorandum that was issued at the end of your visit says that the silence of
22:41.060 - 22:47.900:  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shows his brazen indifference to the violence in Manipur.
22:47.900 - 22:49.980:  What more could he possibly be doing?
22:50.300 - 22:56.220:  He just chose to talk about the violence against these two women outside the parliament in one
22:56.220 - 23:03.300:  of his rare press conferences and he has refused to come to parliament and allow the opposition parties
23:03.300 - 23:08.980:  to debate about it and we have been asking that the Prime Minister should come and reply to the debate
23:08.980 - 23:15.840:  which the ruling BJP government has refused. It is definitely not safe to allow this conflict to
23:15.840 - 23:21.540:  continue for Indian citizens and more than that I don't think this kind of violence can continue.
23:21.540 - 23:24.220:  People are not willing to go back to their homes.
23:24.800 - 23:30.140:  Indian Member of Parliament, Kenny Mosy, Karen Anniti speaking to Julian Marshall.
23:31.260 - 23:35.840:  Now to one of the most anticipated events on New Zealand's social calendar,
23:35.840 - 23:41.060:  as the battle commences for the 2023 bird of the year, the people's favourite,
23:41.060 - 23:47.000:  the native Kakapur parrot was controversially banned from competing last year for winning too
23:47.000 - 23:52.520:  often but it is now back in the running alongside five extinct species which have been included
23:52.520 - 23:58.580:  to draw attention to endangered birds. So in what this year is billed as the bird of the century
23:58.580 - 24:03.400:  contest, may the best bird win. Here's our reporter, Shantel Hartle.
24:04.100 - 24:05.240:  Meet the Kakapur.
24:09.440 - 24:14.680:  This green feathered, flightless bird with its curious booming sound has captured the hearts of New
24:14.680 - 24:20.340:  Zealanders, winning the bird of the year contest twice. Organizers removed it from last year's
24:20.340 - 24:25.300:  ballot to give other endangered birds a chance at winning the title. While some felt that was the
24:25.300 - 24:31.120:  right decision, others were angry the Kakapur wasn't included. One commentator even called it an
24:31.120 - 24:38.740:  attack against democracy. There was similar upset in 2021 when a native bat, a mammal, was included
24:38.740 - 24:44.340:  as an entrant and then won the competition. Organizers are hoping to steer away from more
24:44.340 - 24:50.800:  controversy instead focusing on New Zealand's extinct species. The first of those is the Wikau,
24:50.920 - 24:55.840:  also known as the Laughing Owl, given the name because of its range of calls including
24:55.840 - 24:59.640:  streaks and barking sounds. Next is the Huya.
25:05.560 - 25:10.780:  This songbird looks similar to a crow with its glossy black plumage and an orange beak.
25:10.780 - 25:17.540:  The last official sighting was in 1907. Another songbird, the New Zealand Thrush, makes the list.
25:17.840 - 25:22.640:  This was said to be capable of minicking other birds. There's also the Bushren and the South
25:22.640 - 25:29.520:  Island snipe, two of the last native species to disappear for good in the 1960s and 70s.
25:29.900 - 25:31.860:  The winner won't be announced until November.
25:32.360 - 25:33.340:  Chantel Hartle
25:34.440 - 25:39.640:  The Irish singer Shaneid Okona died last week aged 56 and there has been an outpouring of
25:39.640 - 25:45.500:  superlatives to describe her talents. She is of course best known for one song, Nothing compares to
25:45.500 - 25:51.840:  you which was released in 1990 but written by Prince several years earlier. So what is the origin
25:51.840 - 25:57.200:  of the song and how did she come to cover it? Susan Rogers was Prince's sound engineer
25:57.540 - 26:02.100:  in the mid 1980s. She's now a professor at Berkeley College of Music in Boston.
26:02.500 - 26:06.000:  This is her first hand account as told to the BBC.
26:15.060 - 26:21.340:  On the day that Nothing compares to you was written. We were working at a warehouse in Minnesota.
26:21.340 - 26:27.780:  This is before Princess Paisley Park Studios were built. That morning, Prince was in a really bad
26:27.780 - 26:35.320:  mood because his housekeeper Sandy Cipione had to leave unexpectedly because her father passed
26:35.320 - 26:41.480:  away suddenly without warning. Now Sandy was someone who had worked for Prince since his earliest
26:41.540 - 26:48.880:  days as a recording artist. Sandy's role was to stop the refrigerator, make the bed, do the laundry,
26:48.880 - 26:54.700:  just basically take care of Prince's personal life and she took care of so many of the little
26:54.700 - 27:02.520:  details in Prince's house. So when Sandy had to go away, Prince was getting increasingly
27:02.740 - 27:09.900:  miffed. His mood was just getting more and more angry. Now this time was before he was a superstar.
27:10.180 - 27:15.380:  He was, I think if I remember correctly, right around the time that the purple rain album was
27:15.540 - 27:20.880:  released. He didn't know how to solve this problem, the fact that his housekeeper wasn't there and
27:20.880 - 27:25.560:  he didn't know whom to turn to. The two of us were working at the warehouse and he looked at me and
27:25.560 - 27:31.140:  he said, when Sandy coming back? Well, I didn't know, but right after that Prince grabbed his notebook
27:31.220 - 27:36.300:  and he went off to a little private room where we had installed a bed. He liked to write in bed.
27:36.380 - 27:41.900:  So he went off to this bed with his notebook. When he came back, he told me what instruments to set up,
27:42.040 - 27:47.980:  the Yamaha DX7 and some others and we did this song and then the opening line. It's been seven
27:47.980 - 27:54.320:  hours and 13 days since you took your love away. Sounded very much to me like something that
27:54.320 - 27:59.240:  might have been inspired by Sandy not being there. In particular, the line
28:03.820 - 28:09.800:  all the flowers that you planted, mama in the backyard, all died when you went away. Sandy would
28:09.800 - 28:15.120:  take care of the houseplants. Sandy would be the one who would have planted flowers around the house.
28:15.600 - 28:22.400:  This was not a romantic relationship, but if you're a songwriter, you just take the germ of inspiration
28:22.400 - 28:29.960:  and then you weave it into a story that may not be totally true. When Shanade's version of the song
28:29.960 - 28:36.200:  came out, Prince had a manager whose name was Steve Farnoli. In the late 80s, Steve Farnoli left
28:36.200 - 28:44.280:  Prince and began managing Shanade. When Shanade was looking for songs for her next album, Steve said
28:44.280 - 28:51.640:  to her, there's this great song on a very small obscure album by the family, one of Prince's
28:51.640 - 28:57.160:  protégé bands. It's called Nothing Compared to You. It's a wonderful song. You should cover it.
28:57.560 - 29:01.640:  So she liked the song and she did and it was a huge hit for her.
29:07.240 - 29:13.680:  In the backyard, all died when you went away.
29:16.940 - 29:22.880:  That's a funny thing about Prince. He was a genius with melody and he was a genius with writing
29:22.880 - 29:31.780:  hooks, but he was a poor judge of which songs of his would catch the public's ear. His two most
29:31.780 - 29:38.560:  commercially successful songs are Nothing Compared to You and Kiss. Nothing Compared to You was
29:38.560 - 29:43.520:  covered by someone else in order to become successful. Prince didn't have a good ear for knowing
29:43.520 - 29:45.720:  which of his songs would be popular.
29:55.280 - 29:59.240:  Susan Rogers, who was Prince's sound engineer in the mid 1980s.
30:00.300 - 30:06.220:  A lot is said about the London property market and the sky high prices for places that are cramped,
30:06.220 - 30:11.620:  dilapidated, or even missing basic communities like a bathroom yet still managed to sell.
30:11.680 - 30:18.180:  Now however, even Londoners are surprised as a flight of stairs has gone up for sale,
30:18.180 - 30:24.240:  marketed as a potential home or office space, and with a highly produced video tour online set
30:24.240 - 30:25.540:  to a jaunty soundtrack.
30:33.400 - 30:38.100:  The agents are really selling it, but in reality, is this a livable space?
30:38.800 - 30:43.800:  So to find out what this might be like, I've come to a very similar staircase on the back of
30:43.800 - 30:49.600:  the BBC building here in London and to meet my reporter Stephanie Prentice. Stephanie,
30:50.700 - 30:55.020:  something like this really are for sale in London as a potential development opportunity.
30:55.060 - 31:02.020:  It is, so the stairwell we are walking down is almost identical to the one that's on the
31:02.020 - 31:06.860:  stairs. We've got concrete stairs, steel structure around it, and then big glass windows,
31:07.400 - 31:12.100:  and what the sellers are saying is that this could become a living space, an office space somewhere
31:12.100 - 31:16.640:  to hang out. If you've got planning permission, you could turn it into a fully functioning home
31:16.640 - 31:21.800:  they're saying, but I mean Alex, we're in the stairwell now. Would we live in a stairwell like this?
31:21.960 - 31:25.900:  I'm struggling to see how this might work, but you put a bedroom.
31:26.480 - 31:30.660:  Well, these little platforms which again, they're the same sizes the one on offer, you could fit.
31:31.260 - 31:37.160:  I'm looking at it now, a single mattress, maybe, a very small sofa. We're having a somewhat
31:37.160 - 31:41.600:  nice time walking down these stairs, but what goes down must come up. We've actually walking up
31:41.600 - 31:46.500:  these stairs. It's a four-story building that's on sale so your life would be spent
31:46.500 - 31:52.340:  doing a fair amount of cardio, but the one selling point it has in Wear London as Alex, we know
31:52.340 - 32:00.120:  about this market, it is on the market for $25,000 US dollars. In an area where most properties are
32:00.120 - 32:07.460:  around $500,000 US dollars, so my thinking is this probably will sell. And it's not the only quirky
32:07.460 - 32:12.620:  property that's been sold of it, is it? It's not. I mean, there's a lot of conversation around
32:12.620 - 32:17.740:  the London market. Some of them saying it's a nightmare, it's a disaster. We saw one property
32:17.740 - 32:23.640:  recently where the bed was on a platform above the kitchen, and another one where the shower
32:24.140 - 32:27.140:  was right next to the kitchen as well. They were in the exact same space.
32:27.460 - 32:31.620:  So not the most beautiful property, but maybe it wins on the three golden rules of property,
32:31.620 - 32:34.920:  which are? Location, location? Location.
32:36.960 - 32:40.000:  Journalist and potentially an estate agent, Stephanie Prentes.
32:43.340 - 32:48.540:  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
32:48.540 - 32:53.960:  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
32:53.960 - 33:01.800:  The address is globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on Twitter at Global News Pod.
33:01.800 - 33:07.320:  This edition was mixed by Chesney Forks Porter, and the producer was Emma Joseph.
33:07.680 - 33:12.200:  The editor is Karen Motton. I'm Alex Ritzon. Until next time, goodbye.
