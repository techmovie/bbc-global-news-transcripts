*01:29.940- 01:31.700* :  Lots of birds this week.
*01:32.400- 01:35.880* :  We speak to a woman who set up a clinic for hummingbirds
*01:35.880- 01:38.240* :  in her Mexico City apartment,
*01:40.020- 01:40.760* :  and the world's oldest chicken,
*01:41.840- 01:42.960* :  living in the US state of Michigan.
*01:42.980- 01:44.840* :  She's fearing quesadam.
*01:45.180- 01:46.960* :  She's been a big part of the world.
*01:47.520- 01:48.240* :  She's been a big part of the world.
*01:51.920- 01:52.080* :  She's been a big part of the world.
*01:52.080- 01:53.940* :  I'm reefing trying to eat onion chicken.
*01:53.940- 01:54.080* :  She's fearing quesadam.
*01:56.740- 01:56.920* :  Quite sassy.
*01:57.100- 01:58.260* :  She has to have her blueberries yogurt in the morning.
*02:03.800- 02:03.940* :  She stumbles when she walks sometimes.
*02:04.700- 02:04.780* :  But so do I.
*02:06.620- 02:06.660* :  Else where?
*02:06.660- 02:09.920* :  Round and round the rugged rock...
*02:09.920- 02:11.360* :  ...the rugged rock of the rock.
*02:13.920- 02:14.020* :  Random round, the rugged rock,
*02:14.020- 02:15.160* :  ...the ragged rock of the bug√ºn gradar.
*02:15.600- 02:22.380* :  and it's mean, it's not green, it's quite large, quite glangular and interestingly coloured.
*02:22.880- 02:25.380* :  A new species of Toad discovered in Kenya.
*02:25.920- 02:29.300* :  Hi, this is Sardir and you're listening to HappyPod.
*02:29.500- 02:31.620* :  This is Katia in Mexico City.
*02:32.120- 02:34.200* :  You're listening to the HappyPod.
*02:34.200- 02:40.180* :  I'm Pablo Vervoroglu and you're listening to the HappyPod from the BBC World Service.
*02:52.180- 02:55.820* :  That is the sound of dozens of mangelonic penguins.
*02:56.340- 03:00.740* :  These birds are native to South America, particularly the region of Patagonia.
*03:01.000- 03:05.820* :  Just under 15 years ago, one colony that lived at El Pedral Beach was under threat
*03:06.320- 03:07.960* :  with only 12 penguins left.
*03:08.900- 03:13.940* :  Dr Pablo Vervoroglu is a biologist and the founder of the Global Penguin Society.
*03:13.940- 03:16.920* :  He's dedicated his career to protecting them.
*03:17.480- 03:21.960* :  His work has helped that dwindling population to grow to more than 8,000 today.
*03:21.980- 03:25.500* :  He's currently at a biodiversity summit here in London,
*03:26.040- 03:28.980* :  which is bringing together conservationists from around the world.
*03:29.700- 03:35.600* :  15 years ago, we discovered this new colony and there was only six pairs of penguins.
*03:36.080- 03:40.120* :  They were looking for a safe and secure place to start a new colony,
*03:40.120- 03:45.000* :  but definitely that was not the place to be because there were a lot of reckless people
*03:45.000- 03:46.320* :  and careless visitors.
*03:46.860- 03:51.140* :  They were garbage all over the place in the coastal area within the nests.
*03:51.520- 03:53.320* :  Some of them also were hunting.
*03:53.840- 03:57.400* :  So immediately, we realized that we needed to protect the colony.
*03:57.400- 04:01.800* :  And the right thing to do was to restrict the access of these reckless people.
*04:02.280- 04:07.320* :  And then the following years, we had 40 pairs and then 70 and then 180.
*04:07.340- 04:12.060* :  And we were able to convince the land owners and also the government.
*04:12.720- 04:15.400* :  So it was designated as a wildlife refuge.
*04:16.080- 04:20.800* :  But instead of closing this place, there was a paradigm shift.
*04:21.400- 04:24.560* :  So we need to include the people in our conservation actions.
*04:25.080- 04:31.020* :  So what we did is we held the land owners to develop a responsible ecotourism operation.
*04:31.020- 04:36.640* :  And that also generated jobs and incomes for the community and the local people.
*04:37.120- 04:42.700* :  So people started to perceive that keeping the area safe and healthy and pristine
*04:43.200- 04:47.140* :  and also keeping the penguins healthy was a good thing for their economy.
*04:48.060- 04:51.900* :  The amazing thing is that if there's something good about plastics,
*04:51.900- 04:57.260* :  is that you can see them, climate change is an abstract concept.
*04:58.040- 04:59.660* :  It's difficult to understand them.
*05:00.060- 05:04.140* :  But let me tell you this, when we arrive with all these hundreds of other lessons,
*05:04.140- 05:08.120* :  they see all the area full up with garbage and the nesting areas.
*05:08.720- 05:11.520* :  The same day, before we leave, they look back and they say,
*05:11.900- 05:13.100* :  everything is neat and tidy.
*05:13.360- 05:13.980* :  We did that.
*05:13.980- 05:18.840* :  So for us, it's a way to empower adolescents and also members of the community
*05:19.480- 05:22.660* :  about the capacity that they have to change the planet.
*05:23.220- 05:27.360* :  The great thing is that year after year, we could see penguins coming back.
*05:27.780- 05:31.860* :  And in the last census, we counted 8,000 breeders.
*05:32.300- 05:36.440* :  So when you go now, the image that you see is unbelievable.
*05:36.440- 05:41.800* :  And I think one of the most amazing wildlife spectacles on the planet
*05:42.060- 05:46.640* :  is to be within a penguin colony when they are all brain and vocalizing together.
*05:47.380- 05:52.280* :  So for us, that's the way penguins thank us for all our actions.
*05:52.780- 05:55.660* :  Could you describe what these penguins look like?
*05:55.660- 05:57.640* :  But also, what do they sound like?
*05:58.100- 06:01.400* :  The ones we have in Argentina are called Magellanic penguins.
*06:01.920- 06:05.000* :  They are about 40, 45 centimeters tall.
*06:05.400- 06:06.440* :  They are black and white.
*06:07.080- 06:09.380* :  But the incredible thing is that they are so different.
*06:09.380- 06:10.680* :  They have personalities.
*06:11.360- 06:14.660* :  Some penguins are really fearful or less social.
*06:14.660- 06:17.020* :  Some others are more friendly and even curious.
*06:17.020- 06:18.240* :  They get close to us.
*06:18.880- 06:21.780* :  And all the penguins, they vocalize in different ways.
*06:21.780- 06:23.160* :  So peuple.
*06:24.600- 06:26.100* :  This is the way Magellanic penguins go.
*06:26.140- 06:26.420* :  They go.
*06:34.280- 06:39.160* :  Imagine a big colony with thousands of them vocalizing like this at the same time.
*06:44.560- 06:48.800* :  You attended this biodiversity summit in London and you've obviously been with a lot of
*06:49.180- 06:50.740* :  conservationists from around the world.
*06:51.280- 06:54.500* :  Tell me, to you, what is the importance of summits like this?
*06:54.940- 06:59.920* :  Conservationists, we work in very difficult places and isolated places, you know.
*07:00.260- 07:03.360* :  We some people work in the forest, in caves, in Antarctica.
*07:04.320- 07:10.300* :  So getting together in a room, it's so powerful because you can work in synergy.
*07:10.900- 07:15.940* :  We share a lot of knowledge, experience and we are also, this week, we've been discussing
*07:15.940- 07:16.620* :  the future.
*07:17.260- 07:21.320* :  What is going to be the future for our wildlife and our planet?
*07:21.780- 07:24.460* :  Our goal is to change the behavior of people.
*07:24.920- 07:26.820* :  We cannot change the behavior of wildlife.
*07:27.360- 07:32.420* :  Pablo Borbara-Glue helping to protect Argentina's majestic mangellenic penguins.
*07:32.860- 07:35.020* :  Now, from penguins to hummingbirds.
*07:41.780- 07:46.720* :  Hummingbirds make this sound by beating their wings which flap thousands of times per minute.
*07:46.720- 07:52.080* :  I don't know much more about hummingbirds, but one woman who does is Katia Latouf from
*07:52.080- 07:52.900* :  Mexico City.
*07:53.040- 07:58.400* :  For the last 12 years, she's dedicated her life to them, even turning her home into a
*07:58.400- 08:02.880* :  clinic for hundreds of the tiny birds, which face numerous threats in a busy city.
*08:03.660- 08:06.000* :  I am an animal lover, you know?
*08:06.400- 08:08.020* :  I respect life.
*08:08.640- 08:13.780* :  Even if it's the life of a small insect, for me, it's sacred.
*08:14.640- 08:21.460* :  And one day, an association of animal protection called me, an association I used to help.
*08:21.920- 08:28.580* :  They said, a woman came this morning and she left a baby hummingbird on our desk saying,
*08:28.580- 08:33.800* :  I found him in the street, you are with animals, so take care of him.
*08:34.220- 08:37.620* :  I said, I don't know anything about hummingbirds.
*08:38.560- 08:39.900* :  How shall I do it?
*08:40.200- 08:42.920* :  They said, okay, so what we can do, we'll let him die.
*08:42.920- 08:46.260* :  I said, no, never, please, please, bring it.
*08:46.600- 08:55.260* :  He was a baby with the right eye pulled out by a bird or an attack of something and he
*08:55.400- 08:57.060* :  stayed with one eye.
*08:57.380- 09:07.980* :  And for me, he came to my life, Gucci, in 2012, I was battling against a terminal cancer
*09:08.280- 09:10.880* :  where they gave me two months to live.
*09:11.480- 09:17.080* :  And Gucci comes and stay on my shoulder, nine months he lived with me.
*09:17.460- 09:19.060* :  They're fascinating birds, aren't they?
*09:19.240- 09:22.100* :  How do you go about caring for a sick or an injured bird?
*09:22.760- 09:25.140* :  I have so many methods, it depends.
*09:25.140- 09:34.300* :  I have now around 32 injured, the wings, which is very, very delicate, we cannot fix it.
*09:34.760- 09:37.180* :  So they stay with me for life.
*09:38.100- 09:40.560* :  And they have a kind, not in cage.
*09:41.020- 09:42.540* :  They are free to walk.
*09:42.960- 09:47.640* :  For me, having wings doesn't mean you have to spend your life in a cage.
*09:47.740- 09:53.040* :  I adapted some feeders for them because they cannot walk.
*09:53.560- 09:57.860* :  Right now Katya, how many birds do you have in your apartment in your clinic?
*09:58.380- 10:02.400* :  Last month, I had 130, that's a lot.
*10:02.880- 10:06.720* :  But I was capable and able to free.
*10:07.820- 10:15.740* :  Each week, 30 or 20, I took them to a place full of garden, full of flowers.
*10:16.260- 10:21.040* :  So I freed a lot of them and I still have 32 today.
*10:21.520- 10:22.220* :  Where are they?
*10:22.220- 10:26.660* :  Do they have a little space, little bed or where do you put them?
*10:27.600- 10:30.080* :  I think they have the space I don't have.
*10:32.620- 10:33.660* :  You know why?
*10:33.660- 10:37.060* :  I have a big apartment with two big bedrooms.
*10:37.760- 10:44.240* :  I manage to make each bedroom, bringing like trees, dry trees from outside.
*10:45.240- 10:46.960* :  You know, I am in peace.
*10:47.440- 10:49.220* :  They give you such energy.
*10:50.080- 10:56.260* :  That's why I always associate my story of getting out from a terminal cancer
*10:56.760- 10:58.760* :  because my love of the hummingbirds.
*10:59.780- 11:02.600* :  Hummingbird Helper, Katya Latouf in Mexico City.
*11:03.560- 11:07.660* :  Now to France and the man they call the Michelangelo of Tatuists.
*11:08.080- 11:11.900* :  Mikhail Dupuassi has made history by becoming the first tattoo artist
*11:11.900- 11:16.620* :  to win a coveted prize from the Paris Academy of Arts, Science and Literature.
*11:17.060- 11:18.700* :  David Shazan went to meet him.
*11:19.160- 11:23.200* :  Mikhail Dupuassi is an artist first and a tattooist second.
*11:23.960- 11:26.600* :  And the reason he's been compared to Michelangelo
*11:26.620- 11:31.500* :  is because he often uses images from medieval stained glass windows
*11:32.220- 11:37.620* :  to create vivid luminous tattoos with really intricate details.
*11:38.380- 11:42.420* :  And his work is so celebrated that people come from all over the world
*11:42.420- 11:47.080* :  from as far away as Japan, Australia and Mexico
*11:47.260- 11:51.720* :  to get a piece of his art forever etched on their bodies.
*11:52.340- 11:55.720* :  I spoke to him on the set of a TV show about tattooing
*11:55.960- 11:59.940* :  and I asked him what he most loves about tattooing.
*12:00.460- 12:05.880* :  For me it was a fantastic experience because it looks like a wizard, you know?
*12:06.120- 12:06.740* :  A magician.
*12:07.020- 12:08.580* :  Yes, exactly, a magician.
*12:08.580- 12:11.040* :  So for you, it's something magical.
*12:11.040- 12:14.640* :  It's also something that makes people feel happy.
*12:15.280- 12:16.980* :  He feels good when he's arrived.
*12:17.780- 12:20.560* :  Sometimes he feels no good during the tattoo.
*12:21.600- 12:23.160* :  Because it's very painful sometimes.
*12:23.660- 12:27.720* :  And of course, after the tattoo, it's a great moment.
*12:27.720- 12:32.400* :  It's an emotional moment because the tattoo is finished.
*12:33.040- 12:36.520* :  And David, what makes Mikhail and his work so popular?
*12:37.140- 12:39.820* :  Well, he spent three decades honing his craft
*12:40.500- 12:43.560* :  to create stunning images often from antiquity,
*12:44.100- 12:46.860* :  their pictures of saints, biblical scenes.
*12:46.980- 12:51.760* :  His customers are often history buffs, teachers or academics
*12:51.760- 12:54.260* :  who appreciate his attention to detail.
*12:54.900- 12:57.760* :  And of course, they were prepared to pay thousands of dollars
*12:57.820- 13:02.260* :  for tattoos that can take months or even years to finish.
*13:02.840- 13:06.800* :  He told me that for some, the process is akin to therapy.
*13:07.480- 13:10.360* :  You can have a very difficult moment in your life.
*13:10.880- 13:12.660* :  You can lost someone.
*13:12.660- 13:14.680* :  It looks like a therapy, you know?
*13:15.180- 13:19.580* :  But I have another kind of customer like a collector.
*13:19.580- 13:23.740* :  The people say, OK, I have a just 20% of my skin.
*13:23.740- 13:24.440* :  It's free.
*13:25.000- 13:26.740* :  I keep this part for you.
*13:27.360- 13:32.140* :  And when you arrive in my shop, I can recognize this tattoo artist.
*13:32.280- 13:35.600* :  This arm is tattooed by a great tattoo artist.
*13:36.380- 13:39.060* :  It looks like a museum, you know,
*13:39.060- 13:40.380* :  and the collector of the hink.
*13:40.660- 13:44.160* :  So that's Mikhail Depuesi, the Michelangelo of tattoos,
*13:44.160- 13:47.400* :  doing the job he loves and making people happy.
*13:48.000- 13:51.440* :  Like one teacher who I spoke to, who just had a tattoo
*13:51.440- 13:54.360* :  of a Norse god-etched on his back, he said,
*13:54.360- 13:57.620* :  it was like having his own personal masterpiece.
*13:58.460- 14:00.060* :  David Shazan in Paris.
*14:01.340- 14:03.860* :  Breathylizes urine tests, attempting
*14:03.860- 14:05.360* :  to walk in a straight line.
*14:06.040- 14:07.460* :  These are all methods that have been used
*14:07.460- 14:10.460* :  to test how much alcohol somebody has had to drink.
*14:11.180- 14:13.580* :  But researchers at universities in the United States
*14:13.580- 14:17.040* :  and Canada have now come up with a more unorthodox test.
*14:17.660- 14:18.640* :  Rebecca Wood reports.
*14:19.540- 14:21.880* :  Tongue twisters, they're tricky, they're tough,
*14:22.420- 14:24.260* :  and a struggle if you've drunk enough.
*14:24.260- 14:26.760* :  She sells sea shells by the sea shore.
*14:27.180- 14:29.580* :  The shells she sells are surely sea shells.
*14:29.760- 14:32.300* :  Try sea-cell sea shells after a sherry,
*14:32.780- 14:34.640* :  or a pint in the pub, and then,
*14:34.720- 14:37.360* :  Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
*14:37.940- 14:40.380* :  a peck of pickled peppers, Peter Piper Picks,
*14:40.480- 14:42.580* :  or a red riocha with...
*14:42.580- 14:44.920* :  Round and round the ragged rock, the ragged rock, the ragged rock,
*14:45.200- 14:49.060* :  the ragged rock, the ragged rascal ran.
*14:49.560- 14:51.520* :  Well, research by Stanford University
*14:51.520- 14:52.940* :  and the University of Toronto
*14:53.400- 14:55.300* :  suggesting linguistic teases like these
*14:55.300- 14:58.600* :  could be used to alert people to their alcohol levels.
*14:59.280- 15:00.580* :  They conducted a small study
*15:00.920- 15:02.940* :  that involved getting 18 adults drunk
*15:02.940- 15:04.700* :  on a specific amount of alcohol,
*15:05.280- 15:07.500* :  and then asking them to recite these tricky phrases
*15:07.820- 15:11.100* :  before drinking, and then every hour for a while after.
*15:11.740- 15:13.160* :  Their attempts were recorded,
*15:13.480- 15:15.760* :  and their voice patterns analysed by technology
*15:16.240- 15:17.860* :  to predict intoxication levels
*15:18.360- 15:20.960* :  with reported 98% accuracy.
*15:22.000- 15:24.060* :  Now, it's not the first time that tongue twisters
*15:24.060- 15:25.660* :  an alcohol have been paired together
*15:26.080- 15:28.660* :  as professional voice coach Samantha Boffin explains.
*15:29.260- 15:30.800* :  Looking back in history,
*15:31.040- 15:33.040* :  there's one that was written for World War I,
*15:33.120- 15:35.920* :  and it was a song, which is a tongue twister, in fact,
*15:35.920- 15:36.660* :  that we still use.
*15:36.980- 15:38.600* :  Each first was meant to be sung faster,
*15:38.980- 15:40.860* :  which presented issues for soldiers, in fact,
*15:40.920- 15:42.700* :  who had consumed large quantities of beer.
*15:42.860- 15:44.560* :  It's Sister Suzy's sewing shirts for soldiers.
*15:44.800- 15:46.060* :  There's lots of verses to it,
*15:46.280- 15:48.600* :  and it was designed to get soldiers into a twist.
*15:49.000- 15:51.280* :  Well, from Sister Suzy back to that science,
*15:51.760- 15:54.260* :  a much larger, more diverse study is needed
*15:54.260- 15:56.200* :  to confirm the validity of the findings.
*15:56.920- 15:58.380* :  But could it mean a future
*15:58.800- 16:00.160* :  when my car will only unlock
*16:00.200- 16:02.140* :  if I'm victorious at a voice challenge,
*16:02.680- 16:04.960* :  or could a bartender decide I've had enough
*16:04.960- 16:07.920* :  if I can't successfully say my sentences?
*16:08.780- 16:10.540* :  Sounds like we better start tongue twisting,
*16:10.920- 16:12.200* :  and why not aim high?
*16:12.560- 16:14.300* :  Here's to month again with what is apparently
*16:14.300- 16:16.000* :  one of the world's toughest.
*16:16.280- 16:19.540* :  The six-six shakes, six-sheeps, six.
*16:19.880- 16:22.400* :  The six-six shakes, six-sheeps, six.
*16:22.920- 16:26.040* :  The six-six shakes, six-sheeps, six-sheeps, six-sheeps,
*16:26.040- 16:26.280* :  six-sheeps difficult.
*16:26.760- 16:27.900* :  If you choose a different one every day,
*16:27.900- 16:30.240* :  it means that you don't kind of nail one,
*16:30.620- 16:32.440* :  and then think, oh, I can do this, this is easy-peasy.
*16:32.800- 16:35.000* :  If you do something different every day,
*16:35.540- 16:37.840* :  then it'll work different parts of your mouth,
*16:38.180- 16:40.600* :  so that you're gonna full work out over a week.
*16:40.780- 16:41.580* :  Better get practicing.
*16:42.140- 16:42.760* :  Rebecca Wood.
*16:43.360- 16:44.300* :  MUSIC
*16:47.800- 16:50.320* :  Coming up, the Ukrainian band using their music
*16:50.320- 16:51.420* :  to promote peace.
*16:52.100- 16:53.720* :  What can we do that is useful,
*16:53.780- 16:55.140* :  because you know, we're not in military.
*16:55.600- 16:57.500* :  Like, I don't think I will be in your use there
*16:57.500- 16:58.420* :  in Ukraine physically.
*16:58.740- 17:01.080* :  So we thought, why don't we write about, you know,
*17:01.100- 17:02.400* :  about what's going on in Ukraine?
*17:02.740- 17:04.180* :  We'll meet the Bloom Twins.
*17:04.360- 17:05.980* :  MUSIC
*17:10.240- 17:12.140* :  Suddenly, my quilt is ripped off me,
*17:12.280- 17:13.780* :  and my room is full of white men,
*17:14.100- 17:15.200* :  and I thought I'm done for.
*17:15.420- 17:16.180* :  These are fascists.
*17:16.260- 17:17.120* :  They found where I live.

*18:26.200- 18:26.300* :  MUSIC
*18:30.340- 18:31.480* :  Back to our birds.
*18:31.720- 18:34.940* :  The average chicken lives somewhere between five and ten years,
*18:35.580- 18:37.420* :  but one chicken in Michigan has lived
*18:37.920- 18:38.600* :  a lot longer.
*18:39.220- 18:40.980* :  Peanut is 21 years old
*18:40.980- 18:43.220* :  and has been awarded a Guinness World Record
*18:43.220- 18:45.160* :  as the oldest chicken in the world.
*18:45.160- 18:47.980* :  We met her owner, Marcy Parker Darwin.
*18:48.760- 18:49.860* :  Her mom's name was Nanette,
*18:50.000- 18:52.560* :  and Nanette had these chicks that she was busy with.
*18:53.220- 18:55.760* :  And I noticed one of the eggs had not hatched.
*18:56.280- 18:57.840* :  And I picked up the egg
*18:58.020- 19:00.060* :  and I was walking down with a pond with it
*19:00.100- 19:00.940* :  to throw it in the water
*19:00.940- 19:02.600* :  so that it wouldn't attract predators.
*19:03.340- 19:05.440* :  And I thought I heard a noise
*19:05.560- 19:08.120* :  and when I held the egg up for my meal,
*19:08.600- 19:09.460* :  I heard it chirp.
*19:09.800- 19:13.680* :  And so I realized there was still a live chick inside the egg.
*19:13.680- 19:14.980* :  So I went back to the house
*19:14.980- 19:17.100* :  and put a flashlight up to it
*19:17.100- 19:19.740* :  and saw that there was a chick struggling to get out.
*19:20.500- 19:21.480* :  So I peeled it out.
*19:22.280- 19:23.360* :  Her mother rejected her.
*19:23.700- 19:26.240* :  She didn't want that soggy chick
*19:26.240- 19:28.840* :  when her chicks were all fluffy and running around.
*19:29.840- 19:32.440* :  So I brought Peanut in and put her under a heat lamp
*19:33.260- 19:35.860* :  and cared for her for the first few days.
*19:35.860- 19:38.060* :  I showed her how to drink water,
*19:38.060- 19:39.360* :  dipped her beak in the water
*19:39.360- 19:42.360* :  and did all the things that a mama hen would do.
*19:43.280- 19:45.980* :  And then I took her back out to the flock
*19:45.980- 19:48.100* :  and they were pecking at her,
*19:48.340- 19:49.980* :  you know, like chickens do
*19:49.980- 19:52.560* :  to a new chick on the block.
*19:53.300- 19:55.520* :  And so I had to bring her back
*19:55.880- 19:57.420* :  and she lived in the house with us
*19:57.420- 19:58.820* :  for the first couple of years of her life.
*19:59.780- 20:01.400* :  Which I also suspect
*20:01.400- 20:03.480* :  might have something to do with her longevity
*20:03.480- 20:07.600* :  because she didn't get exposed to a lot of the diseases
*20:07.680- 20:09.720* :  and things that you might find in the barnyard.
*20:09.720- 20:10.300* :  I don't know.
*20:10.540- 20:12.220* :  And of course, she was spoiled rotten.
*20:12.940- 20:15.740* :  She ate really well and got a lot of attention.
*20:16.780- 20:20.780* :  She's just been a spoiled little chicken ever since.
*20:21.600- 20:21.800* :  Wow.
*20:21.800- 20:25.460* :  Well, I'd love to get on to what it's like living with Peanut.
*20:25.460- 20:27.880* :  But first, I think we need to discuss
*20:27.880- 20:30.320* :  her enormous achievement.
*20:31.140- 20:33.900* :  The world record holder for the oldest chicken.
*20:34.540- 20:36.220* :  Tell me, how did that come about?
*20:37.200- 20:39.640* :  Friends started putting two and two together.
*20:40.660- 20:43.180* :  I hadn't really paid much attention to how old she was.
*20:43.180- 20:44.880* :  It just seemed like she'd been with me forever.
*20:45.680- 20:50.260* :  So I started kind of adding up the years
*20:50.820- 20:53.020* :  and a friend who had moved to California.
*20:53.780- 20:54.980* :  He came back 18 years later
*20:54.980- 20:56.440* :  and Peanut jumped up on his shoulder.
*20:57.080- 20:58.760* :  And he was flabbergasted.
*20:59.820- 21:01.600* :  He said, chickens don't live that long.
*21:02.460- 21:05.320* :  And we realized, no, they really don't.
*21:05.460- 21:06.400* :  So we looked it up.
*21:07.140- 21:10.200* :  And we saw that the last record holder was 14.
*21:11.220- 21:13.760* :  And we thought, well, we know she's got that beat.
*21:14.180- 21:16.000* :  We were sure that she was at least 20.
*21:16.520- 21:20.720* :  And it took six months of having different pieces of evidence.
*21:21.860- 21:24.740* :  And they finally awarded her the record last February.
*21:25.920- 21:28.340* :  And you've written a book about Peanut.
*21:29.020- 21:30.420* :  Yes, my girl Peanut and me.
*21:30.980- 21:31.540* :  It's a message.
*21:31.540- 21:34.380* :  There's a message and I tie Peanut's life into mine,
*21:35.140- 21:37.140* :  which is ask for help when you need it.
*21:37.400- 21:41.700* :  And it's hope because she was kind of a misfit
*21:42.040- 21:45.140* :  and she turned out to be the world's oldest living chicken.
*21:45.140- 21:49.140* :  So it's kind of a message of joy and hope.
*21:49.180- 21:52.040* :  And I think in these times, those are the stories we need.
*21:53.200- 21:55.680* :  Now Peanut was present during our interview,
*21:56.060- 21:57.980* :  but was shy and didn't make much noise.
*21:58.620- 22:01.540* :  So Marcy sent us this voice note from Peanut the Chicken
*22:01.540- 22:03.500* :  just before we recorded this podcast.
*22:14.020- 22:15.860* :  Peanut, the world's oldest chicken.
*22:17.580- 22:19.460* :  The Ukrainian duo Bloom Twins
*22:19.520- 22:22.520* :  are using their music to shine a light on the war in Ukraine.
*22:34.420- 22:37.800* :  Their latest song is called Beat Not Bombs
*22:37.800- 22:38.720* :  and has this message.
*22:38.720- 22:41.020* :  Let's build rather than destroy.
*22:41.620- 22:43.140* :  The duo are based here in London.
*22:43.600- 22:45.560* :  And last year used mobile phone footage
*22:45.560- 22:48.660* :  of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a music video.
*22:49.480- 22:52.520* :  The sisters Anna and Sonia spoke to Andrew Peach.
*22:53.180- 22:55.420* :  We started to sing before we could talk.
*22:56.060- 22:58.480* :  Our dad and my mom, they met in a band.
*22:58.600- 23:00.940* :  And then, you know, they fell in love with each other
*23:00.940- 23:01.860* :  and then married each other.
*23:01.860- 23:03.860* :  And then three kids appeared.
*23:04.440- 23:07.060* :  And I was older sister, she plays cello.
*23:07.060- 23:10.140* :  I always played piano and then son of a place fluid.
*23:10.140- 23:12.560* :  And we both sing when I was in Ukraine.
*23:12.560- 23:14.800* :  I thought I wanted to continue with mathematics.
*23:15.440- 23:18.140* :  But then somehow there was serendipity of situations
*23:18.140- 23:21.580* :  where matter managers in Ukraine about 12 years ago.
*23:21.920- 23:23.340* :  And they were like, I'm about to go so cool.
*23:23.340- 23:25.900* :  Why don't you guys move to London for summer break
*23:25.900- 23:27.080* :  before going to universities?
*23:27.620- 23:29.420* :  And it was going to work out great, you know,
*23:29.580- 23:31.080* :  if now you can come back to universities.
*23:31.680- 23:32.340* :  And why London?
*23:32.460- 23:36.440* :  Why not do the acting Ukraine just because your manager
*23:36.440- 23:39.460* :  told you that would be a more fertile market for your music?
*23:40.280- 23:42.880* :  London was one of the places where we considered
*23:42.880- 23:43.960* :  as a capital of music.
*23:44.180- 23:45.420* :  So it was like dream come true.
*23:45.980- 23:48.860* :  Yeah, I kind of agree on a certain degree,
*23:48.860- 23:49.920* :  like I love music,
*23:49.920- 23:52.300* :  but I believe the capital of music is literally
*23:52.300- 23:54.120* :  anywhere you have your headphones in.
*23:54.560- 23:55.940* :  And so we started performing
*23:55.940- 23:57.420* :  before we could reach the mics.
*23:57.440- 24:00.400* :  And it was something that a great family taught us.
*24:00.460- 24:02.840* :  And there was something that we will always take with us
*24:03.160- 24:05.480* :  is the ability to reach for the stars.
*24:05.540- 24:07.000* :  And that's literally what we have done
*24:07.000- 24:09.580* :  came from a little town in Burberry to London,
*24:10.020- 24:12.260* :  to not only pursue our career and a dream,
*24:12.400- 24:14.480* :  but also make the whole world know our country.
*24:14.840- 24:17.420* :  I love the relationship between you as sisters
*24:17.420- 24:19.060* :  is really, really apparent to hear.
*24:19.060- 24:19.700* :  It's really nice.
*24:19.940- 24:23.780* :  Oh, yeah, because I was, oh, no, I think this.
*24:23.780- 24:27.200* :  And I think that, yeah, exactly that, exactly that.
*24:27.720- 24:31.380* :  Tell me about being in London with your Ukrainian heritage
*24:31.380- 24:34.480* :  and seeing what's been happening there in the last 18 months.
*24:34.500- 24:36.400* :  How has that been to be away from home?
*24:37.240- 24:39.360* :  It's been hard with all how can we help?
*24:39.920- 24:41.520* :  What can we do that is useful?
*24:41.520- 24:42.940* :  Because, you know, we're not in military.
*24:43.380- 24:45.300* :  Like, I don't think I will be any use there
*24:45.300- 24:46.160* :  and you print physically.
*24:52.600- 24:54.340* :  So we thought, why don't we write about
*24:54.380- 24:55.480* :  what's going on in Ukraine?
*24:55.480- 24:57.840* :  Use the real documental footage what's going on?
*24:57.840- 25:00.940* :  So because there's so much media around the world
*25:00.940- 25:02.360* :  has so many different information
*25:02.400- 25:03.980* :  that's kind of contradicting each other.
*25:04.220- 25:07.100* :  So the best way to do it is to have a documental footage
*25:07.100- 25:09.580* :  and use music to spread the important message.
*25:12.280- 25:16.200* :  All this time, all this time, all this time,
*25:16.200- 25:20.620* :  all this time, what is going on?
*25:21.160- 25:23.000* :  So the documental footage is like,
*25:23.000- 25:24.520* :  it's actually pretty easy for us
*25:24.520- 25:26.280* :  because we have a lot of friends who lives there
*25:26.600- 25:28.200* :  and then they just blow out the phone
*25:28.200- 25:30.340* :  and then they film it and then they send it to us.
*25:30.780- 25:32.880* :  And then also there was many, many, many group chats
*25:32.920- 25:34.320* :  with people just filming stuff
*25:34.360- 25:36.560* :  or was going on like outside of their window.
*25:42.160- 25:46.140* :  So it's just like a, it's a 100% factual footage.
*25:46.140- 25:47.980* :  It's not something that's been made up.
*26:05.280- 26:07.420* :  What sort of reaction have you had to the work
*26:07.420- 26:08.560* :  that you've created?
*26:08.840- 26:10.760* :  Well, most of them were Ukrainians
*26:10.780- 26:12.040* :  and that means a lot to us.
*26:12.040- 26:14.560* :  And they said that it means a lot to them
*26:14.560- 26:17.380* :  that we keep doing it, keep pursuing our goal
*26:17.380- 26:19.940* :  to make the whole world know what's going on
*26:19.940- 26:21.260* :  and keep talking about it.
*26:21.960- 26:23.960* :  And mainly because we're based here in London,
*26:23.960- 26:27.240* :  that's important that we spread in the work here
*26:27.460- 26:28.420* :  and then see what happens.
*26:28.420- 26:29.160* :  I'm coming.
*26:29.160- 26:29.640* :  I'm coming.
*26:30.160- 26:31.120* :  I'm coming.
*26:31.160- 26:31.860* :  I'm coming.
*26:32.160- 26:33.520* :  I'm coming.
*26:33.520- 26:34.120* :  I'm coming.
*26:34.160- 26:35.060* :  I'm coming.
*26:35.160- 26:35.960* :  I'm coming.
*26:36.160- 26:36.900* :  I'm coming.
*26:37.160- 26:37.680* :  I'm coming.
*26:38.160- 26:38.680* :  I'm coming.
*26:40.280- 26:42.500* :  Anna and Sonja the Bloom Twins.
*26:43.820- 26:46.140* :  Now to a remarkable discovery in the high forests
*26:46.140- 26:49.080* :  of Mount Kenya, a new species of Toad.
*26:49.720- 26:51.840* :  It's known as the Kenyan Volcano Toad
*26:52.120- 26:53.680* :  and its shedding light on the mysterious
*26:53.680- 26:56.680* :  evolutionary history of amphibians in East Africa.
*26:57.460- 26:59.420* :  Our African regional editor, Richard Hamilton,
*26:59.900- 27:00.500* :  has more details.
*27:01.440- 27:04.860* :  Finding this new Toad species has puzzled scientists
*27:05.200- 27:08.760* :  due to its unique appearance and unexpected presence
*27:08.760- 27:09.520* :  in Kenya.
*27:10.160- 27:14.000* :  Contrary to the prevailing belief that most of Kenya's amphibian
*27:14.000- 27:18.560* :  species originated after volcanic activity subsided
*27:18.560- 27:22.080* :  millions of years ago, the Kenyan Volcano Toad
*27:22.400- 27:25.260* :  may date back as far as 20 million years,
*27:25.920- 27:29.820* :  making it significantly older than the volcanic formation
*27:30.220- 27:31.580* :  of Mount Kenya itself.
*27:31.580- 27:36.660* :  Dr Simon Loeder is the principal curator of vertebrates
*27:36.660- 27:39.220* :  at the Natural History Museum here in London.
*27:40.000- 27:43.440* :  He has described the discovery of such an ancient lineage
*27:44.020- 27:47.700* :  predating the formation of the mountains as mind-blowing.
*27:48.200- 27:50.300* :  This one is quite remarkable as being quite different,
*27:50.900- 27:54.020* :  quite large, quite glandular, smooth skinned,
*27:54.020- 27:56.460* :  quite graysal and interestingly coloured.
*27:56.800- 28:00.940* :  Green and brown and it seems to be sort of nicely camouflaged
*28:01.000- 28:02.640* :  in the rainforest that it lives in.
*28:03.100- 28:06.960* :  We know very little about it, but based on its close relatives,
*28:07.060- 28:10.020* :  it probably is likely to do a number of interesting things,
*28:10.840- 28:12.560* :  things like giving birth to live young,
*28:12.560- 28:16.420* :  which these Toads do in these high mountains in East Africa.
*28:16.740- 28:20.340* :  The discovery of this Toad also challenges the notion
*28:20.340- 28:23.920* :  of what scientists call the Kenyan interval.
*28:24.580- 28:27.880* :  This is a term used to describe the stark contrast
*28:27.880- 28:32.860* :  in amphibian diversity between Kenya and its neighbouring countries.
*28:33.780- 28:39.140* :  While Ethiopia and Tanzania have long been biodiversity hotspots
*28:39.140- 28:42.580* :  for amphibians, Kenya's geological history
*28:42.580- 28:47.600* :  and its frequent volcanic activity has made it a challenging place
*28:47.600- 28:49.380* :  for these creatures to thrive.
*28:50.240- 28:53.680* :  But the unique characteristics of this Toad suggest
*28:54.040- 28:57.840* :  that the Kenyan interval theory may not be as straightforward
*28:57.840- 28:59.580* :  as previously believed.
*29:00.600- 29:03.720* :  So far the researchers from the Natural History Museum
*29:04.140- 29:09.080* :  as well as the National Museums of Kenya have only found one specimen
*29:09.860- 29:12.400* :  and they don't know how many others might be out there.
*29:13.020- 29:15.940* :  And since it lives in trees and is camouflaged,
*29:16.200- 29:17.680* :  it's a tricky one to spot.
*29:18.500- 29:20.920* :  They also don't know how this new species
*29:21.520- 29:23.260* :  actually came to be on Mount Kenya.
*29:24.120- 29:27.140* :  But these are all the sorts of mysteries and conundrums
*29:27.540- 29:28.860* :  that naturalists love.
*29:29.780- 29:30.360* :  Richard Hamilton.
*29:35.220- 29:36.660* :  And that's all from us for now.
*29:36.660- 29:39.140* :  Remember if you'd like to be part of the happy pod
