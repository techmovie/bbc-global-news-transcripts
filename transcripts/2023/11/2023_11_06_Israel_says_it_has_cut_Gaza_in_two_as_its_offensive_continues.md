*01:40.380- 01:43.260* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:46.220- 01:50.280* :  I'm Robin Brandt and in the early hours of Monday the 6th of November, these are our
*01:50.280- 01:50.960* :  main stories.
*01:51.540- 01:56.740* :  The Israeli military says its troops have reached the coast to cut Gaza in two and in
*01:56.740- 02:00.300* :  circle Gaza City, where intense fighting is raging with Hamas.
*02:00.820- 02:05.800* :  State media in Lebanon says an Israeli strike on a car near the border has killed four civilians,
*02:06.440- 02:07.500* :  three of them children.
*02:08.180- 02:12.720* :  And a hostage crisis at Hamburg Airport in Germany has ended with the arrest of the suspect
*02:12.720- 02:14.760* :  and the safe rescue of a child.
*02:17.500- 02:18.400* :  Also in this podcast.
*02:18.740- 02:24.340* :  This designed, says Musk, to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak.
*02:24.800- 02:28.980* :  Have you come across GROC-1, the new sarcastic chap-on?
*02:33.180- 02:37.920* :  But first, big explosions were reported on Sunday evening in Northern Gaza, where the
*02:37.920- 02:41.260* :  Israeli army is engaged in an intense battle with Hamas.
*02:41.860- 02:44.880* :  Video footage showed an enormous fireball in the area.
*02:45.360- 02:50.520* :  When Israel said its forces had cut Gaza in two, after its ground offensive against
*02:50.520- 02:53.520* :  Hamas reached the coast of the Palestinian territory.
*02:54.100- 02:57.300* :  Ray Admiral Daniel Hagari is Israel's army spokesman.
*03:00.800- 03:05.080* :  Today, IDF forces led by Golan and circled Gaza City.
*03:05.280- 03:09.600* :  They reached the seashore in the southern part of the city of Gaza and they encircled
*03:09.600- 03:10.380* :  Gaza City.
*03:10.940- 03:13.880* :  There now exists a south Gaza and a north Gaza.
*03:14.580- 03:17.160* :  They reached the coastline and they are holding this line.
*03:18.040- 03:23.260* :  Earlier on Sunday, all telephone and internet services to Gaza were again cut off.
*03:23.760- 03:28.360* :  Israeli media have been reporting that the Israel defense forces have suggested they will
*03:28.360- 03:31.820* :  reach the center of Gaza City within 48 hours.
*03:32.500- 03:37.080* :  And against this backdrop, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the occupied
*03:37.080- 03:41.520* :  West Bank, the Iraqi capital Baghdad, and also Turkey on Sunday.
*03:42.100- 03:44.460* :  We will have more on his diplomacy later.
*03:44.460- 03:49.440* :  But first, I spoke to our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, who is in Jerusalem, and they asked
*03:49.440- 03:53.460* :  him about the latest surge in the Israeli offensive, especially in northern Gaza.
*03:53.980- 03:59.160* :  It is clear that the focus of Israel's military operations is absolutely in the north.
*03:59.220- 04:04.120* :  There are air strikes up and down the Gaza strip all the time and we are seeing very intense
*04:04.120- 04:10.120* :  air strikes this evening with huge plumes of flame rising into the sky and visible from
*04:10.120- 04:11.160* :  a long distance away.
*04:11.640- 04:17.080* :  But essentially what we are seeing here is the region's most powerful military closing
*04:17.080- 04:20.280* :  in on Gaza City and the surrounding refugee camps.
*04:20.280- 04:26.740* :  Heming those remaining civilians, who we think number as many as 300,000, plus whatever
*04:26.740- 04:32.060* :  Hamas fighters are still there, into an ever smaller area.
*04:32.400- 04:36.840* :  And the fact that there are so many civilians still there is obviously a major problem for
*04:36.840- 04:37.260* :  the Israelis.
*04:37.340- 04:42.980* :  Trying to persuade people to leave and for one reason or another, many people have decided
*04:42.980- 04:47.520* :  to stay and that is putting them now in real, real danger.
*04:47.980- 04:53.520* :  And just to be as clear as we can, am I right that despite Israel's insistence, threats,
*04:53.520- 05:00.320* :  warnings for people to leave the north and head south, that there are still 300, 400,000
*05:00.320- 05:03.720* :  gardens, possibly that remain in or around Gaza City?
*05:03.940- 05:08.160* :  No one knows exactly how many, but those are the sorts of figures that you keep hearing.
*05:08.160- 05:14.000* :  And when you see pictures that still emerge from particular scenes in the Gaza City area,
*05:14.000- 05:17.020* :  you realize there are just an awful lot of people there.
*05:17.460- 05:22.620* :  Now the Israelis are arguing that this is because Hamas have been preventing people from leaving.
*05:22.620- 05:25.980* :  They want essentially these civilians to be used as human shields.
*05:26.360- 05:30.020* :  Others I think have stayed simply because they felt that they didn't want to leave their
*05:30.140- 05:30.340* :  homes.
*05:30.460- 05:35.040* :  But the reports from the south suggested that it wasn't safe down there either.
*05:35.500- 05:39.420* :  But for whatever reason, this large, large number of people have stayed put.
*05:39.420- 05:44.360* :  And that is obviously making life a great deal more complicated because Israel regards
*05:44.380- 05:48.840* :  the Gaza City area as the biggest, most important, Hamas stronghold.
*05:49.240- 05:50.920* :  Paul Adams reporting from Jerusalem.
*05:51.300- 05:56.240* :  Well, a day before Israel's forces made those advances, cutting the gars and territory
*05:56.240- 05:56.860* :  in two.
*05:57.380- 06:01.460* :  A group of Israeli and international journalists went into Gaza City.
*06:01.500- 06:06.880* :  They were embedded with and under the control of armored and infantry brigades belonging
*06:06.880- 06:08.500* :  to the Israel Defense Force.
*06:09.360- 06:14.060* :  And she'll Fetha who writes for the times here in the UK and the Israeli newspaper Harretts
*06:14.360- 06:14.920* :  was one of them.
*06:15.060- 06:16.920* :  My colleague, Johnny Diamond, spoke to him.
*06:17.320- 06:18.060* :  It's a war zone.
*06:18.060- 06:23.040* :  It's a city where more than a million people live, but it doesn't feel like a city you
*06:23.040- 06:26.660* :  don't hear or see any signs of civilian life.
*06:26.660- 06:31.060* :  You see the buildings and many of them are damaged and you see the Israeli force going
*06:31.060- 06:31.340* :  in.
*06:32.260- 06:37.680* :  You see the rockets and the mortars being fired by an invisible enemy, which is mostly underground.
*06:37.680- 06:41.420* :  Obviously, I'm talking about the small area in which I went into.
*06:41.540- 06:44.120* :  For all purposes, this is no longer a city, it's a war zone.
*06:44.680- 06:50.520* :  When you went in, you went in with the Israeli military who were presumably being relatively
*06:50.520- 06:56.100* :  careful of your safety as well, and yet at the same time, this was an active military
*06:56.100- 06:56.740* :  environment.
*06:56.740- 07:03.640* :  Yes, there was certainly a significant number of Hamas members underground.
*07:03.640- 07:06.600* :  We didn't see any of them, but their presence was very clear.
*07:06.600- 07:11.840* :  As our convoy was going in, there were a couple of solvers of rockets fired close by towards
*07:12.540- 07:17.220* :  the Israeli city of Ashadod, so they still have rocket launch sites that they're controlling.
*07:17.220- 07:22.960* :  And while our convoy was inside, there was both small arms fire and more to fire in
*07:22.960- 07:23.340* :  and around.
*07:23.500- 07:27.240* :  So there certainly is a presence of, there certainly is a military presence of Hamas
*07:27.260- 07:30.620* :  still there, though, from what we've seen and what we've also been hearing from Israeli
*07:30.620- 07:34.320* :  officers at large, number of the Hamas, the members have already been killed.
*07:34.960- 07:41.520* :  It's almost about four weeks since Israel told the residents of the strip to head south.
*07:41.740- 07:45.040* :  Did you see many civilians there?
*07:45.040- 07:46.020* :  Did you see many residents?
*07:46.880- 07:51.520* :  No, the two or three hours I was inside, we didn't see from the convoy or from the forward
*07:51.520- 07:54.340* :  command post that we spent some time at.
*07:54.740- 07:56.340* :  We didn't see any civilians whatsoever.
*07:56.340- 08:02.220* :  I asked, obviously, many of the soldiers and officers who I spoke with, a few of them
*08:02.220- 08:06.220* :  have seen over the last eight days, handfuls of civilians, but it looks like certainly
*08:06.220- 08:09.620* :  from that area, the civilian population is left there.
*08:10.080- 08:13.800* :  There are various assessments, but most of the assessments that I've heard are around
*08:13.800- 08:19.560* :  three, three quarters of something just north of a million passes, civilians living in
*08:19.560- 08:25.240* :  the area, which is now the, where the ground operation is happening, so this should be
*08:25.240- 08:31.020* :  around 200 or so, thousands still there, but they're probably concentrated mainly in the
*08:31.020- 08:34.380* :  central Gaza area, which is where the Israeli forces have yet to go into.
*08:34.680- 08:37.160* :  You mentioned a command post, do you able to describe it?
*08:37.380- 08:43.520* :  It was a small villa overlooking, the Mediterranean where most of the villa was already destroyed,
*08:43.520- 08:47.540* :  the command post was in the garden behind the wall, which was around the villa.
*08:48.220- 08:52.900* :  There are a number of tanks there, guarding it and some infantry soldiers, one table where
*08:52.900- 08:55.560* :  there's food in there, but that's basically everything there is there.
*08:55.560- 09:00.200* :  The command posts are inside the tanks and armored vehicles, that's where the best things
*09:00.200- 09:05.620* :  that they use to directly, to brigade on the ground, or they're all inside tanks and
*09:05.660- 09:06.540* :  armored vehicles.
*09:06.720- 09:12.040* :  You had the opportunity to talk to some soldiers on the ground as well, I mean, did you
*09:12.040- 09:14.340* :  get a sense of mood from that?
*09:14.800- 09:19.800* :  So we have to remember that these Israeli soldiers were called up on October 7th on the day
*09:19.800- 09:21.180* :  of the Hamas attack on Israel.
*09:21.960- 09:28.100* :  They have been there for now for four weeks, they have been in this very intense and closed
*09:28.100- 09:33.560* :  off military environment where they spent three weeks just training and preparing for
*09:33.560- 09:35.840* :  this maneuver and then they've been on it for the last eight days.
*09:36.340- 09:40.060* :  So a lot of the questions that we've been dealing with in the media and the coverage
*09:40.060- 09:45.680* :  and the civilian side of this war, and the more international aspects of it as well,
*09:46.260- 09:49.980* :  they've basically gone over their heads, they've been focused on what they're doing and
*09:49.980- 09:55.980* :  they're still talking about that day on October 7th as the Shabbat that was the day when
*09:55.980- 10:01.220* :  it all began and from their perspective they're still on a mission to respond to what
*10:01.220- 10:05.460* :  happened on that day and that's very much the prevailing mood among the soldiers and
*10:05.460- 10:06.280* :  officers I spoke to.
*10:06.760- 10:11.400* :  The journalist Anshel Feffa who went into Gaza City on Saturday for just a few hours
*10:11.980- 10:14.060* :  embedded with the Israel Defense Forces.
*10:14.900- 10:18.840* :  Well Palestinians in central Gaza have spent much of Sunday picking through the destroyed
*10:18.840- 10:24.240* :  buildings in the Maghazi refugee camp which had been hit in a strike the previous night.
*10:24.840- 10:30.220* :  Our correspondent Rushdie Abu al-Aluf visited the camp and he says at least 50 bodies have
*10:30.220- 10:31.400* :  been recovered so far.
*10:31.740- 10:37.000* :  This is Maghazi refugee camp, it's in the safe area where Israel advised 1.2 million
*10:37.000- 10:42.400* :  people in Gaza City on the north to flee south, this is the safer but this destruction
*10:42.400- 10:48.400* :  is in the safe area where about 50 bodies are already recovered from this air strike and
*10:48.400- 10:50.400* :  many many others are missing.
*10:50.720- 10:57.120* :  This is the biggest peace strike in this very crowded refugee camp in the middle of Gaza
*10:57.260- 11:03.960* :  The people are fleeing south because the fighting is intensified around the Gaza City and
*11:03.960- 11:09.620* :  the north where Israel is started to see ground operation five different battles are going
*11:09.620- 11:10.100* :  on there.
*11:10.500- 11:16.320* :  Over my Israel issue another warning for the people asking them to leave Gaza City and the north
*11:16.360- 11:17.540* :  and to come here.
*11:18.440- 11:22.560* :  Rushdie Abu al-Aluf, well it's not confirmed if the damage that Rushdie was describing
*11:22.560- 11:26.080* :  there was caused by an Israeli military strike.
*11:26.660- 11:29.480* :  Peter Lorna is a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces.
*11:30.120- 11:35.740* :  Any strikes that are taking place in southern Gaza are specific intelligence-based strikes
*11:36.980- 11:41.060* :  specifically against terrorist elements that doesn't say that they can't be unfortunate
*11:41.060- 11:45.860* :  deaths and it is a tragedy for all of the people that can't stress that enough but it
*11:45.860- 11:48.580* :  is a war nevertheless that Hamas started.
*11:49.600- 11:55.220* :  Now as we heard earlier it's against that background of even more intense violence that
*11:55.220- 12:00.780* :  the United States top diplomat Antony Blinken has been touring states in the Middle East trying
*12:00.780- 12:03.620* :  to stop the Gaza fighting spreading further.
*12:04.100- 12:09.460* :  On Sunday he first visited the West Bank and then Iraq where he issued another call for
*12:09.460- 12:09.860* :  a restraint.
*12:10.520- 12:15.700* :  Everyone is looking to take the necessary steps, use their authority, use their influence
*12:15.700- 12:19.180* :  to try to make sure that this stops doesn't happen.
*12:19.460- 12:26.200* :  But if you project forward to the future what we all agree is that in defining that future,
*12:26.660- 12:31.600* :  in shaping that future for Gaza, for the West Bank, Palestinian voices have to be at the
*12:31.600- 12:32.120* :  center of that.
*12:32.760- 12:38.320* :  In Iraq Mr Blinken also focused on the growing number of attacks by Iran backed militia
*12:38.700- 12:42.200* :  on U.S. forces and on this matter Mr Blinken had this to say.
*12:42.580- 12:48.600* :  It was very important to send a very clear message to anyone who might seek to take advantage
*12:49.280- 12:53.660* :  of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our personnel here or anywhere else in the region.
*12:54.580- 12:55.540* :  Don't do it.
*12:56.000- 13:00.080* :  So he went to the West Bank and then he was in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq.
*13:00.080- 13:01.520* :  He's now in Turkey.
*13:02.160- 13:03.820* :  So what might that visit produce?
*13:03.980- 13:07.960* :  Well this assessment from Berza Shimsek from the BBC's Turkish service.
*13:08.440- 13:15.460* :  Anthony Blinken's main concern will be asking for the hostages to be released held by Hamas.
*13:15.800- 13:22.300* :  The main countries who play a role in it are Qatar and Egypt, but Turkey might also play
*13:22.300- 13:28.140* :  a role because Turkish government has close relationship with the political wing of Hamas.
*13:28.420- 13:31.080* :  So that's why Turkey is important in that matter.
*13:31.380- 13:35.720* :  But at the same time Turkey has recalled its ambassador to Israel ahead of the visit.
*13:35.720- 13:39.980* :  So what relationship is there at the moment between Ankara and Tel Aviv?
*13:40.100- 13:46.320* :  Erdogan said that although he is no longer willing to talk to Netanyahu, Turkey's intelligence
*13:46.320- 13:54.000* :  chief is in talks with his Israeli counterpart and Turkey cannot cut all the ties with Israel.
*13:54.000- 13:57.220* :  He said diplomatic efforts should continue.
*13:57.220- 14:02.220* :  So what we understand is that although there is tension, although that Erdogan is no longer
*14:02.220- 14:08.240* :  willing to talk to Netanyahu, the relationship on the intelligence level and on the diplomatic
*14:08.240- 14:09.580* :  level will continue.
*14:10.000- 14:16.640* :  How significant is the role that President Erdogan can play here as a broker, as a mediator
*14:17.140- 14:18.740* :  between the U.S. and between Israel?
*14:19.000- 14:24.960* :  Erdogan has been seeing himself as one of the leaders or maybe the only leader of the
*14:24.960- 14:28.880* :  Muslim countries he has been attempting to play this role.
*14:29.360- 14:32.720* :  So Turkey is important in that sense.
*14:33.480- 14:34.960* :  Bazaar Shimsek reporting.
*14:35.480- 14:39.980* :  Now Lebanese state media say three children and their grandmother have been killed by an
*14:39.980- 14:42.620* :  Israeli military strike on a car near the border.
*14:43.140- 14:46.560* :  As Bala says its fired rockets into Israel in response.
*14:47.220- 14:49.000* :  Hugo Bachega is in southern Lebanon.
*14:49.660- 14:57.100* :  For civilians were killed in this Israeli strike and this would be the worst attack with
*14:57.280- 14:58.280* :  civilian casualties.
*14:58.940- 15:03.500* :  We have been for weeks talking about the violence here along the border between the Hasbola
*15:03.700- 15:06.920* :  movement here in Lebanon and the Israeli army.
*15:07.320- 15:11.560* :  And I think this is going to raise fears that the violence here could escalate.
*15:11.840- 15:19.100* :  And shortly after news of this attack emerged, Hasbola said that it had retaliated, had
*15:19.100- 15:24.880* :  responded by launching missiles targeting Northern Israel.
*15:25.640- 15:26.740* :  Hugo Bachega reporting.
*15:27.420- 15:31.800* :  Let's step away from the war in Israel and Gaza now and look at some other news.
*15:32.060- 15:36.780* :  Ukraine's government is investigating how an awards ceremony close to the front line
*15:36.840- 15:42.380* :  in the Zaporozir region was allowed to go ahead after a Russian missile strike on the
*15:42.380- 15:44.580* :  gathering killed more than 20 soldiers.
*15:45.160- 15:50.400* :  Elite personnel from Ukraine's mountain assault brigade assembled out in the open on Friday
*15:50.460- 15:54.280* :  to receive medals to mark artillery day when the attack happened.
*15:54.280- 15:56.520* :  A correspondence Jenny Hill is in key.
*15:57.080- 16:00.080* :  There are a lot of questions about that and complete disbelief.
*16:00.460- 16:06.240* :  And I know too, actually, that such an event an award ceremony could be held in the open
*16:06.240- 16:08.500* :  air so close to the front line.
*16:08.600- 16:13.940* :  There is drone footage purportedly recorded by the Russians of the attack.
*16:13.940- 16:16.540* :  Now, our good friends at BBC Verify have taken a look for us.
*16:16.920- 16:20.480* :  They've geolicated it to the site of the strike in this village.
*16:20.960- 16:24.400* :  And that's exactly the point that people here in Ukraine want to point out.
*16:25.240- 16:30.380* :  Actually, both Ukrainian troops and Russian troops on the front line regularly use drones,
*16:30.380- 16:33.560* :  surveillance drones to monitor one another's movements.
*16:33.560- 16:38.040* :  So the idea that such an event could be held under those circumstances,
*16:38.620- 16:41.900* :  Vegas belief for a lot of people so that there are a lot of questions being asked.
*16:41.900- 16:45.620* :  As you know, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence has ordered an investigation.
*16:46.320- 16:50.220* :  What about a military response from Ukraine's authorities?
*16:50.220- 16:52.520* :  Have we seen anything along those lines yet?
*16:52.660- 16:57.700* :  Not yet, but President Zelensky of Ukraine after things like this happen
*16:58.140- 17:02.240* :  tends to speak in fairly strong terms about responding retribution.
*17:02.240- 17:07.240* :  But I suppose this feeds into the broader state of the front line.
*17:07.280- 17:09.660* :  It's not just soldiers who are suffering.
*17:10.300- 17:14.040* :  I've spoken in recent days to lots of refugees who are fleeing,
*17:14.960- 17:19.220* :  intensified, shelling, intensified, fighting up and down this front line.
*17:19.340- 17:22.440* :  I mean, you mentioned Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky there.
*17:22.440- 17:26.360* :  He has said in the past 24 hours, I think not for the first time,
*17:26.400- 17:29.460* :  that there is a belief that he has and others around him
*17:29.460- 17:32.940* :  that events in Gaza and Israel, nearly a month into those,
*17:32.940- 17:38.020* :  is frankly distracting from Ukraine's effort to defend itself against Russia.
*17:38.300- 17:43.340* :  I think his broader concern, and of course, what's happening in Gaza really feeds into this,
*17:43.400- 17:48.620* :  is that the world will get, first of all, a bit bored about what's going on in his country,
*17:48.620- 17:51.640* :  that fatigue will set in amongst his allies,
*17:51.640- 17:56.000* :  particularly those who are supplying aid and money to the country.
*17:56.380- 17:59.940* :  And I think he's painfully aware that the counteroffensive,
*17:59.940- 18:06.360* :  which began back in June, has only really resulted in some very limited territorial gains.
*18:07.580- 18:09.180* :  Jenny Hill reporting from Kiev.
*18:09.840- 18:11.240* :  This is the Global News podcast.
*18:11.240- 18:13.820* :  Now let's slow things down a little bit.
*18:14.400- 18:18.020* :  A musical experiment using the electrical signals generated
*18:18.020- 18:20.580* :  by medicinal plants that are used in chemotherapy
*18:21.340- 18:23.500* :  is being offered to cancer patients here in the UK.
*18:23.500- 18:25.700* :  It's designed to help them cope better
*18:26.220- 18:28.200* :  with the stressful environment of treatment.
*18:28.840- 18:30.600* :  Maggie is the cancer support charity,
*18:30.600- 18:33.440* :  is working with musician Helen Anahita Wilson,
*18:33.920- 18:36.220* :  who wanted to make the chemo experience better
*18:36.440- 18:37.780* :  after she went through it herself.
*18:38.500- 18:40.280* :  Nicola Stambridge spoke to those involved.
*18:41.960- 18:46.600* :  Every single sound that you hear comes from a medicinal plant
*18:46.600- 18:51.840* :  and the bio-electricity generated by living organisms
*18:51.840- 18:55.280* :  because we are all bio-electrical beings.
*18:55.940- 18:57.780* :  Composer Helen Anahita Wilson.
*18:58.220- 19:02.000* :  We can hear her music from plants involved in the evolution of chemotherapy
*19:02.800- 19:04.540* :  because they're wired up with electrodes
*19:05.180- 19:06.860* :  to capture electrical charges,
*19:07.580- 19:10.340* :  then Helen converts this data into notes.
*19:11.740- 19:15.380* :  For every plant recording I made in this 28-in-total,
*19:15.920- 19:18.340* :  I assigned a different sound for each one.
*19:19.660- 19:23.720* :  My favourite one is the Madagascan Periwinkle,
*19:23.740- 19:27.620* :  used to treat leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma.
*19:27.960- 19:31.260* :  The petals are really beautiful and really fine
*19:31.260- 19:34.960* :  and they give an extraordinary varied signal.
*19:35.480- 19:38.920* :  So in the music, all of the harp melodies come from the petals
*19:39.300- 19:41.000* :  of a catharantus rozeus.
*19:43.460- 19:47.820* :  There's the European u-tree used to treat breast cancers
*19:48.220- 19:49.800* :  and metastatic cancers.
*19:50.780- 19:54.940* :  If I record the bio-electricity from the trunk,
*19:55.680- 19:59.460* :  I receive a really fat, dense signal.
*20:00.700- 20:02.680* :  Plants have been evolving for 500 million years
*20:02.980- 20:05.980* :  compared to just a human species mega-7 million
*20:06.660- 20:09.140* :  and in that time they've evolved multiple different properties.
*20:10.020- 20:12.960* :  Consultant oncologist Professor Richard Simcock.
*20:13.180- 20:15.560* :  Chemotherapies are often referred to as cytotoxics
*20:15.820- 20:18.740* :  because they attack different parts of the mechanics of cell division
*20:19.460- 20:21.300* :  and because cancer cells divide more often,
*20:21.300- 20:24.360* :  relatively unreliably, it's a weak point
*20:24.420- 20:26.060* :  that chemotherapy agents can attack.
*20:26.800- 20:29.180* :  What we're looking for in plants is toxins
*20:29.880- 20:31.440* :  that attack normal cell division
*20:31.560- 20:34.200* :  and seeing if we can extract them and enhance them
*20:34.600- 20:36.340* :  to use specifically against cancer.
*20:36.720- 20:39.460* :  Botanical elements that can have action against cancer
*20:39.820- 20:42.180* :  in vitro, in the laboratory, is enormous.
*20:42.960- 20:45.660* :  The challenge for scientists has always been to extract that
*20:46.020- 20:49.000* :  to be able to deliver that usefully in a human.
*20:49.680- 20:52.900* :  And the story of Taxol is one that started in the 1960s.
*20:52.900- 20:53.780* :  That's the u-tree extract.
*20:54.240- 20:55.660* :  It wasn't until the late 80s
*20:55.980- 20:58.200* :  that we were able to demonstrate that it could be useful for people.
*21:00.460- 21:04.120* :  Where did the idea of a composition for chemotherapy come from?
*21:04.660- 21:07.240* :  I had chemotherapy in 2020
*21:08.180- 21:12.340* :  and I found it extremely challenging, very frightening.
*21:13.580- 21:17.020* :  And when I learnt that a lot of the drugs being administered
*21:17.020- 21:19.780* :  were naturally derived from plants,
*21:20.580- 21:24.920* :  it demystified the drug in some way that I found helpful.
*21:25.740- 21:27.800* :  There are definitely things that we can do
*21:28.420- 21:30.920* :  in the communal spaces in hospital.
*21:30.920- 21:34.140* :  I remember waiting for my first chemotherapy session
*21:34.680- 21:35.540* :  they started playing
*21:35.540- 21:39.820* :  Prokofiev's Dance of the Nights theme tune to the apprentice.
*21:39.820- 21:41.620* :  It's a very menacing piece of music.
*21:42.420- 21:43.820* :  Technology's allow us to do that.
*21:43.980- 21:46.200* :  Noise-canceling headphones, tablets,
*21:46.780- 21:49.560* :  devices that allow people to access different resources.
*21:50.200- 21:54.340* :  The creative arts are a good way for people to approach their cancer.
*21:54.960- 21:56.980* :  We've worked with artists such as Brian Eno
*21:57.380- 21:59.340* :  in our local hospitals who's provided
*21:59.800- 22:02.720* :  light installations and music as a place of solace
*22:03.800- 22:05.300* :  reflection for people affected by cancer.
*22:06.440- 22:08.980* :  We cannot make chemotherapy easy because it isn't,
*22:09.440- 22:10.720* :  but we can always seek to make it easier.
*22:13.600- 22:16.540* :  That was a very calming Nicholas Danbridge reporting.
*22:19.700- 22:20.180* :  Still to come.
*22:20.540- 22:24.660* :  The threat is that people that are now addicted with heroin
*22:24.660- 22:27.240* :  will look for other type of opioids,
*22:27.240- 22:29.940* :  probably synthetic opioids that could be much harmful.
*22:30.280- 22:33.600* :  Afghanistan used to be the world's largest producer of opium,
*22:34.080- 22:37.060* :  but since a ban on poppy cultivation by the Taliban last year,
*22:37.060- 22:41.120* :  production of the plant has plummeted by around 95%.
*22:51.200- 22:54.260* :  Hey BBC listeners, you come to the Global News podcast
*22:54.260- 22:56.320* :  because you want to stay up to date on the
*22:56.320- 22:58.320* :  Best of International Coverage.
*22:59.020- 23:02.280* :  I'm Erica Kruzkovara from KQED's The Bay podcast
*23:02.480- 23:06.520* :  where we bring you the best of local news around the Bay Area.
*23:07.340- 23:08.820* :  Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
*23:08.820- 23:11.700* :  we bring you conversations with local journalists
*23:11.700- 23:15.060* :  to give you the context and analysis that you need
*23:15.480- 23:18.380* :  to make sense of what's going on in our region.
*23:19.040- 23:22.000* :  You can find the Bay wherever you get your podcasts.
*23:27.660- 23:30.520* :  Heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires,
*23:30.700- 23:33.460* :  catastrophic consequences from climate change.
*23:33.460- 23:34.960* :  What's going on is this real.
*23:35.240- 23:37.860* :  The climate question is the podcast exploring our
*23:37.860- 23:39.260* :  planet's changing environment
*23:39.360- 23:42.680* :  and what we're doing across the world to adapt and respond to it.
*23:42.680- 23:44.080* :  The future is ahead of us.
*23:44.080- 23:47.080* :  A very sensitive to the choices that make today.
*23:47.180- 23:49.740* :  If we don't start fixing it, we're going to be victims of it.
*23:49.820- 23:50.620* :  Get engaged.
*23:50.620- 23:53.360* :  The climate question from the BBC World Service,
*23:53.780- 23:55.940* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*23:57.240- 24:00.480* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast and let's go to Germany now
*24:00.860- 24:04.300* :  where police say an armed father who took his young daughter hostage
*24:04.820- 24:07.300* :  leading to the suspension of flights at Hamburg Airport
*24:07.740- 24:09.800* :  has given himself up without resistance.
*24:10.560- 24:13.300* :  The 35-year-old Turkish man had rammed his car
*24:13.300- 24:16.000* :  through a security area onto an apron
*24:16.000- 24:18.920* :  where the planes are parked before barricading himself
*24:18.920- 24:20.620* :  and the child in his car.
*24:21.080- 24:22.440* :  It happened on Saturday evening.
*24:22.880- 24:25.700* :  He demanded to be allowed on board a nearby parked
*24:25.700- 24:27.160* :  Turkish Airlines plane.
*24:27.160- 24:30.260* :  Our Berlin correspondent Jessica Parker has the details.
*24:30.760- 24:33.360* :  It emerged that a four-year-old girl was in the vehicle
*24:33.360- 24:35.600* :  which remained parked by an airplane.
*24:35.660- 24:39.340* :  Its belief to the incident was sparked by a custody dispute.
*24:39.340- 24:42.560* :  The mother had reported a possible child abduction.
*24:42.560- 24:46.020* :  At the airport, painstaking negotiations were carried out
*24:46.020- 24:48.460* :  with the Turkish national through an interpreter.
*24:49.040- 24:51.860* :  Then finally, this afternoon, a police spokeswoman confirmed
*24:51.860- 24:54.420* :  that a man had been arrested without resistance
*24:54.420- 24:57.100* :  and that the hostage situation was over.
*24:59.560- 25:00.540* :  We have good news.
*25:01.440- 25:03.400* :  The hostage taking in Hamburg is over.
*25:03.620- 25:05.920* :  The man left the vehicle with his daughter.
*25:06.180- 25:08.700* :  The 35-year-old suspected got out of the car.
*25:08.700- 25:11.500* :  The police said carrying his daughter in his arms.
*25:11.920- 25:14.840* :  Throughout, the airport had been evacuated and shut down,
*25:14.840- 25:17.520* :  leading to scores of flight cancellations.
*25:17.840- 25:21.480* :  The episode may raise fresh security concerns about Hamburg Airport
*25:21.480- 25:26.060* :  after in July, climate activists managed to glue themselves to the runway.
*25:26.880- 25:28.260* :  Well, let's go to Afghanistan now.
*25:28.280- 25:32.040* :  It was a decree from the Taliban's Supreme Leader last April
*25:32.540- 25:35.140* :  that banned growing opium poppies in the country.
*25:35.660- 25:38.520* :  And the United Nations says we're now seeing the consequences.
*25:39.100- 25:43.100* :  Before the ban, Afghanistan was the world's largest producer of opium.
*25:43.540- 25:45.560* :  It makes heroin amongst other drugs.
*25:45.560- 25:48.340* :  Since the ban, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime says
*25:48.340- 25:52.220* :  poppy cultivation has plummeted by around 95 percent.
*25:53.000- 25:56.760* :  Ben James heard more from the organization's head of research, Angela May.
*25:57.320- 26:02.640* :  From the satellite images, it's clear that there was this 95 percent decrease,
*26:03.820- 26:07.780* :  so almost eliminating opium from Afghanistan at least in 2023.
*26:08.440- 26:11.820* :  What we see also from the images is that this is a result of
*26:11.900- 26:13.640* :  farmer's decision early on.
*26:14.280- 26:18.700* :  So the farmers decide to solve opium around October and November.
*26:19.280- 26:24.520* :  We see that in 2022, farmers actually planted serious, mostly wheat.
*26:24.520- 26:31.000* :  So that means that the decision was taken much early in October and November 2022.
*26:31.540- 26:36.060* :  Do we know why the farmers chose to move to the crops that you describe?
*26:36.060- 26:40.080* :  There are cash crops like pomegranates, maybe that might make them
*26:40.460- 26:42.860* :  more money to replace what they lost in the opium trade?
*26:43.340- 26:46.540* :  There are crops that could have a higher cash value,
*26:47.080- 26:51.840* :  but these crops require investment, that is why we are arguing that the findings
*26:51.840- 26:58.080* :  of the service here clearly shows the need to help the farmers to make this
*26:58.560- 27:03.160* :  reduction sustainable and help them to invest on more of the future.
*27:03.780- 27:05.980* :  And so invest on this high value crop.
*27:06.680- 27:08.240* :  What sort of state are the farmers in?
*27:08.240- 27:11.280* :  What's the scale of the hardship that going through is a result of this?
*27:11.380- 27:15.100* :  We have looked at in focus four provinces.
*27:15.660- 27:19.700* :  And we calculated that the switch cost to them in these four provinces,
*27:19.700- 27:21.880* :  about one billion US dollars.
*27:22.400- 27:28.620* :  And last year, the opium return was worth about 30% of the
*27:28.620- 27:30.120* :  all agricultural economy.
*27:30.580- 27:35.120* :  So this is a huge loss for the agricultural economy itself,
*27:35.120- 27:41.100* :  because the income from opium is used by farmers also to invest on other crops.
*27:41.100- 27:43.160* :  So to buy 30 liser, for example.
*27:43.700- 27:46.140* :  There might be people listening who are thinking hang on.
*27:46.140- 27:49.560* :  I thought the Taliban made loads of money themselves out of
*27:50.040- 27:52.020* :  poppies in opium production.
*27:52.020- 27:54.600* :  It is true that they've profited in the past from it, isn't it?
*27:54.820- 27:56.820* :  Yes, they did. They profit in the past.
*27:56.820- 28:01.060* :  They in the provinces, they were under their control, so they imposed taxes.
*28:01.440- 28:03.120* :  But no longer, they changed their mind.
*28:03.480- 28:07.540* :  Well, they declared that they wanted to have a country free or drag.
*28:08.140- 28:10.740* :  And this was early in 2022.
*28:11.340- 28:14.120* :  The comment that they made around also the costivations,
*28:14.120- 28:17.320* :  not only relation to what religion prohibit,
*28:17.780- 28:20.300* :  but also the fact that there is a very large
*28:20.840- 28:23.980* :  size on the drug use in Afghanistan itself.
*28:24.160- 28:26.760* :  Drug use around the world as well, we should talk about
*28:27.340- 28:32.660* :  what impact is this having on heroin on the streets of countries globally?
*28:32.660- 28:35.880* :  Is there less of it around now because of this or is it not so simple?
*28:36.200- 28:38.840* :  Definitely, this is an impact because Afghanistan
*28:39.520- 28:45.800* :  supply about 80% of the heroin and opium that is used in the world.
*28:46.380- 28:52.280* :  It's likely that the current shortage will be felt in the many months to come
*28:52.280- 28:56.320* :  because there are inventories across the supply chain from Afghanistan,
*28:56.360- 28:58.160* :  particularly among traders.
*28:58.160- 29:01.400* :  So those inventories will soften the impact,
*29:02.000- 29:04.220* :  but overall if this shortage continues,
*29:04.220- 29:05.940* :  will be clearly felt.
*29:06.140- 29:09.440* :  And the threat is that people that are now addicted with heroin
*29:09.440- 29:12.000* :  will look for other type of opioids,
*29:12.000- 29:14.680* :  probably synthetic opioids that could be much harmful.
*29:15.500- 29:17.820* :  That was Angela May ending that report there.
*29:17.820- 29:20.940* :  She's the head of research at the UN office on drugs and crime.
*29:22.080- 29:26.260* :  Greenland is covered in a sheet of ice that in places is over three kilometers thick,
*29:26.260- 29:27.780* :  but it's melting fast,
*29:27.820- 29:32.140* :  losing 270 billion metric tons of ice every year.
*29:32.740- 29:36.440* :  Greia Jackson has been finding out more about what's happening on this icy island.
*29:39.560- 29:41.000* :  To give you a sense of scale,
*29:41.000- 29:45.520* :  the Great Wall of China weighs around 50 million metric tons,
*29:45.900- 29:51.780* :  so 270 billion is just an impossible amount of ice loss to imagine.
*29:53.180- 29:55.560* :  It's not just that there's a lot of ice,
*29:55.860- 29:57.700* :  it's also really old.
*29:57.960- 29:59.020* :  According to Twilamune,
*29:59.020- 30:02.740* :  she's a scientist with the National Snow and Ice Data Center
*30:02.740- 30:05.200* :  at the University of Colorado in the USA.
*30:05.880- 30:10.020* :  There has been ice sitting here in the Greenland ice sheet of today
*30:10.020- 30:12.740* :  for hundreds of thousands of years.
*30:12.740- 30:18.660* :  So the possibility that we might see a very different shaped Greenland ice sheet
*30:19.220- 30:24.240* :  within the lifetime of a child born today is stunning.
*30:26.460- 30:29.380* :  In fact, if it completely melted away right now,
*30:29.380- 30:34.920* :  it would mean that sea levels would rise by an average of 7.4 meters globally.
*30:34.940- 30:41.580* :  The Greenland ice sheet has so much ice that the mass of ice here
*30:42.120- 30:45.380* :  actually influences Earth's gravitational field.
*30:47.520- 30:49.960* :  That means that when the ice melts in Greenland,
*30:49.960- 30:52.600* :  it causes changes everywhere.
*30:53.180- 30:58.560* :  The movement of ocean currents and also how the air and atmosphere are moving
*30:58.560- 31:01.160* :  helps to dictate where we feel the sea level.
*31:01.360- 31:06.260* :  So folks living far from where ice is lost feel a bigger impact.
*31:08.480- 31:13.400* :  That means people living in Greenland are actually having to plan for lowering sea levels.
*31:14.340- 31:17.440* :  And not just because the oceans are moving away from the island.
*31:17.520- 31:20.380* :  As we lose ice from the ice sheet here,
*31:20.760- 31:24.300* :  the ground that it sits on is able to rise some.
*31:24.780- 31:28.580* :  And that's not the only change to traditional ways of life in Greenland,
*31:28.960- 31:30.580* :  which can be put down to climate change.
*31:31.280- 31:34.500* :  Tobias Simeac is a hunter and fisherman in Annac,
*31:34.780- 31:36.620* :  the biggest city in North Greenland.
*31:38.620- 31:42.500* :  The science of climate change are particularly evident in winter.
*31:43.040- 31:44.840* :  The ice has become very thin now.
*31:45.180- 31:49.600* :  We go on dark-led fishing trips in the winter when there's solid ice,
*31:50.100- 31:54.800* :  when the ice is unstable, we have greater problems with hunting and hunting with dark-leds.
*31:55.500- 31:58.940* :  But Greenland-born journalist Mes Malek Fulsang-Hung
*31:59.320- 32:02.620* :  thinks these changes may not be bad news for everyone.
*32:03.060- 32:07.000* :  The area covered by ice all year round is getting smaller and smaller,
*32:07.840- 32:10.100* :  so you can benefit from that if you're a fisherman.
*32:11.020- 32:15.180* :  And in South where they are farmers, they can have the de-sheeps and the mountains
*32:15.180- 32:17.960* :  walking around freely for a long period of time.
*32:19.020- 32:23.080* :  As for scientists Twila Moon, she says the losses to the Greenland ice sheet
*32:23.080- 32:25.780* :  over the last 25 years are irreversible.
*32:26.300- 32:29.220* :  But we can still control what happens in the future.
*32:29.800- 32:33.320* :  Action today is certainly better than no action at all,
*32:33.320- 32:36.320* :  and an action tomorrow is better than no action at all.
*32:36.980- 32:38.400* :  Greg Jackson reporting there.
*32:39.560- 32:44.200* :  Now let's end on this, the latest addition to the artificial intelligence world of chat
*32:44.200- 32:47.100* :  bots is here, and this one claims to be a little bit different.
*32:47.740- 32:52.260* :  Grok One, from the billionaire behind Tesla, SpaceX, and what we used to call Twitter,
*32:52.760- 32:55.260* :  is coded to answer spicy questions apparently.
*32:55.840- 32:58.200* :  Ella Musk claims it can do sarcasm.
*32:58.500- 32:59.620* :  Yeah, of course it can.
*33:00.140- 33:00.960* :  Terry Egan explains.
*33:01.600- 33:05.600* :  Just a week after Matthew Perry died, best known for his sardonic character,
*33:05.600- 33:12.780* :  Chandler Bing in the sitcom Friends, Elon Musk's new AI chatbot is being touted as a new source
*33:12.780- 33:14.700* :  of irony and satire.
*33:15.080- 33:20.640* :  It's designed, says Musk, to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak.
*33:20.700- 33:24.900* :  Please don't use it if you hate humour he wrote in an ex-post.
*33:25.620- 33:31.580* :  So while it seems that Grok One is already performing better than the first versions of chat GPT
*33:31.580- 33:34.500* :  and Musk assures everyone it will only get better,
*33:34.960- 33:41.100* :  the most interesting feature so far it seems is how it will reply to your innocent questions.
*33:41.180- 33:46.240* :  To back up his assertions, Musk posted examples of how the chatbot
*33:46.240- 33:52.160* :  replied to the question, tell me how to make cocaine, step by step, as you would.
*33:52.640- 33:55.560* :  A screenshot revealed that its replies included,
*33:55.560- 34:01.840* :  obtain a chemistry degree, and set up a clandestine laboratory in a remote location.
*34:02.460- 34:03.440* :  Yes, really.
*34:03.740- 34:07.140* :  Although of course it did also say it was only kidding.
*34:07.740- 34:12.600* :  Musk commented that his chatbot was inspired by Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.
*34:12.600- 34:18.060* :  That's a sci-fi comedy by the British author Douglas Adams made into a TV hit
*34:18.160- 34:20.020* :  that became a cult success.
*34:20.520- 34:24.860* :  Here's the famous reply when its humans asked the meaning of life.
*34:43.300- 34:47.680* :  Unfortunately, AI already has a reputation for fantasising answers,
*34:48.140- 34:54.500* :  and just last week, at a summit here in the UK, Musk said it was one of the biggest threats to humanity.
*34:55.280- 34:59.480* :  So, as Chandler might put it, could this be any less helpful?
*34:59.480- 35:04.440* :  The company behind Grok, XAI, was founded by Musk eight months ago.
*35:04.920- 35:10.820* :  We believe it said in doing our utmost to ensure that AI remains a force for good.
*35:10.820- 35:14.100* :  Unless, of course, they were being sarcastic.
*35:14.800- 35:15.700* :  Terry Egan reporting.
*35:17.840- 35:22.080* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the global news podcast later.
*35:22.080- 35:27.160* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
