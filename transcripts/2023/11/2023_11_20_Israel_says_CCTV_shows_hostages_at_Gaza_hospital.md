*01:28.140- 01:33.680* :  Shift a hospital in Gaza. At the same time a deal to release some of the captives could be getting
*01:33.680- 01:39.160* :  closer. We hear from a former negotiator. The polls have closed in the presidential election in
*01:39.160- 01:45.300* :  Argentina, but many voters were unhappy with the choice on offer. And the former US First Lady
*01:45.300- 01:56.380* :  Rosalind Carter has died at the age of 96. Also in the podcast, we have one and a half billion
*01:56.380- 02:03.060* :  for Napoleon's hat. No regrets. Soap. The Emperor's Shapoor goes under the hammer.
*02:08.000- 02:13.680* :  For the past six weeks, families in Israel and beyond have been desperately hoping for some good
*02:13.680- 02:19.000* :  news about the hostages taken by Hamas on the 7th of October, even as several were released,
*02:19.000- 02:24.100* :  one was rescued and others found dead. There have been occasional reports about possible
*02:24.100- 02:29.100* :  negotiations between Israel and Hamas, but these have so far come to nothing.
*02:29.700- 02:35.240* :  Now, though, it seems an agreement is moving closer. The challenges that remains in the
*02:35.240- 02:40.500* :  negotiations are very minor compared to the bigger challenges. And I believe that
*02:40.500- 02:46.480* :  with the willingness of both parties to engage in to have this deal moving, we can reach there.
*02:46.860- 02:52.320* :  Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Fani, the Prime Minister of Qatar, which has been mediating between
*02:52.320- 02:58.580* :  the two sides. The positive noises come as Israel prepares to widen its military offensive in Gaza,
*02:58.580- 03:06.120* :  which Hamas health officials say has now killed 13,000 people. Israel says it's lost 62 soldiers
*03:06.120- 03:12.220* :  in the fighting in the Palestinian territory, on top of the 1200 people who died in southern Israel
*03:12.220- 03:17.860* :  on the 7th of October. It's also released security camera footage that it says shows hostages
*03:17.860- 03:23.220* :  being brought into Al-Shifa hospital. I heard more about that from our correspondent Nick Beak,
*03:23.220- 03:27.580* :  but first he told me the latest on a possible deal to release some of the captives.
*03:28.520- 03:31.800* :  It's worth pointing out that there have been some false dorns over the past couple of weeks where
*03:31.800- 03:36.980* :  it seemed that they were quite near to announcing something and it all fell away. But the US Deputy
*03:36.980- 03:43.160* :  National Security Advisor has been in Washington talking about them getting closer than they've been
*03:43.160- 03:49.940* :  before to reaching a final agreement. He said that many areas of difference that have previously
*03:49.940- 03:56.640* :  existed. As the Prime Minister in Qatar was saying, it's now the minor details, or certainly the
*03:56.800- 04:01.680* :  smaller details, rather than big major stumbling blocks. They appear to have been overcome.
*04:02.080- 04:08.960* :  We have, of course, seen four hostages released thus far as well as two who we know have died.
*04:09.340- 04:12.780* :  Do you know how many hostages we're talking about in this negotiation?
*04:13.760- 04:18.020* :  No, we don't. I mean, the overall figure is around about 240 hostages,
*04:18.020- 04:23.460* :  believed to have been taken by Hamas on October the 7th. There has been talk over the past
*04:23.460- 04:29.080* :  week or so that potentially 10 hostages a day may be released over what would be a five-day
*04:29.080- 04:34.080* :  ceasefire. That hasn't been confirmed. There have been other figures that maybe more than
*04:34.080- 04:38.740* :  a hundred hostages could be released. So in terms of the figures we don't know, you mentioned
*04:38.740- 04:44.820* :  Oliver that some of the bodies of at least two hostages have been recovered. One of them is
*04:44.820- 04:50.540* :  Noah Marciana. She was a 19-year-old soldier. Her funeral took place in Israel just a couple of
*04:50.540- 04:56.300* :  days ago. And in the past few minutes, the IDF, the Israeli Defence Forces Chief Spokesman,
*04:56.300- 05:02.560* :  has said that he believes that she was actually murdered inside Chief of Hospital. And he's gone
*05:02.560- 05:08.860* :  on to say that Hamas killed a number of hostages within Chief of Hospital. And he's been putting
*05:08.860- 05:14.580* :  forward some CCTV images, which he says backs this up. As with everything, there's so much within
*05:14.580- 05:19.420* :  this conflict, we haven't been able to verify those images that have been put forward tonight,
*05:19.420- 05:25.220* :  but certainly that's what the Israelis have been saying. Hamas, you remember, they say they haven't
*05:25.220- 05:31.580* :  been using the hospital as somewhere where they can keep hostages as human shields. And also,
*05:31.580- 05:35.480* :  they've denied this central Israeli claim that they've got this big headquarters under the
*05:35.480- 05:39.860* :  R. Sheeper Hospital in the north of the territory. Yeah, and that despite the release of this footage
*05:39.860- 05:45.500* :  by Israel tonight. Yeah, that's right. This is the latest video. And I think what Israel is trying to
*05:45.500- 05:51.780* :  do really is build up this body of evidence to show what Hamas has done. They point to the Americans
*05:51.780- 05:56.460* :  who have said that their intelligence shows that Hamas has been using tunnels and also has been
*05:56.460- 06:01.380* :  using hospitals for for military purposes. And Israel all along has said that this has justified
*06:01.380- 06:09.200* :  their operation. Nick Beak in Jerusalem. Well, Gershon Baskin has had long experience of negotiating
*06:09.200- 06:16.200* :  with Hamas, notably in the deal to free the Israeli soldier Gilad Chalit in 2011. His opposite
*06:16.200- 06:21.960* :  number was Khazi Hamad, a senior member of Hamas's political wing. And that relationship persisted
*06:21.960- 06:27.940* :  until very recently. James Menendez asked Mr. Baskin what he made of the reports that a deal was
*06:27.940- 06:34.080* :  close. I relate to everything that's reported on a deal is noise. It's very strange that it's
*06:34.080- 06:37.980* :  coming from the Prime Minister of Qatar was one of the primary interlocutors with these
*06:37.980- 06:44.520* :  Redis and the Hamas. My interpretation of it is its way to tell the Americans to back off some
*06:44.520- 06:50.200* :  of their pressure on Qatar. It might be true and it may not be true. The logistics of the deal
*06:50.200- 06:55.400* :  itself are the easy part of the deal. And he's yet seeming to say that they just need to work out
*06:55.400- 07:00.420* :  the logistics. The logistics are what happens in the actual exchange. Who's on the ground?
*07:00.420- 07:05.360* :  Who's checking the names? Who's verifying identity? That's going to be the International Red Cross
*07:05.360- 07:11.560* :  facilitated by the Egyptian intelligence folks on the ground. The most difficult part is the
*07:11.560- 07:17.400* :  agreement itself between Israel and Hamas. And here it's very difficult to determine what kind
*07:17.400- 07:23.780* :  of progress there is if any. Yeah. You've published a transcript of your messages with
*07:24.320- 07:31.520* :  Ghazi Hamad of Hamar since the 7th of October. In fact, the day of those attacks, including efforts
*07:31.520- 07:40.580* :  to secure the hostages release. What went wrong between you? Well, what went wrong was my understanding
*07:40.580- 07:46.740* :  that he was not really connected to the decision makers who are today in the tunnels underground
*07:46.740- 07:52.440* :  in Gaza. The political leadership of Hamas in Doha and the political leadership of Hamas in
*07:53.140- 07:59.580* :  in Beirut, I believe have no really direct way of communicating with Mr. Sinwar and his colleagues
*07:59.580- 08:03.840* :  in the tunnels in Gaza. And they are the ones who are the decision makers.
*08:04.520- 08:10.560* :  Is that because of the communication problems overall with Gaza? No, I think it was more it was
*08:10.560- 08:17.860* :  more substantive than that. Ghazi Hamad had given me a proposal that we were working on together
*08:17.860- 08:22.720* :  and assured me that the leadership in Gaza and the leadership in Doha agreed to it.
*08:23.080- 08:27.680* :  And I asked him to send it to the Qataris to make sure that they would deliver it to the Israelis
*08:27.680- 08:32.200* :  because it had to go through official channels. And then when I checked out with the Israelis,
*08:32.200- 08:37.120* :  I discovered that the proposal that they had received from the Qataris was somewhat different than
*08:37.120- 08:42.320* :  the one that Lazi Hamad and I had been discussing for Gays. So I understood that he was not directly
*08:42.320- 08:48.300* :  in contact. I came to that conclusion after the Egyptians managed to release two Israeli women.
*08:48.300- 08:52.760* :  And when they had announced that two Israeli women would be released, I checked with people in
*08:52.760- 08:57.800* :  the political level of Hamas. And they had no idea about it whatsoever. They were surprised.
*08:58.080- 09:03.200* :  Okay, so they're out of the loop. But do you think that the political leadership outside of Gaza
*09:03.420- 09:10.160* :  is more prepared to make a deal over the hostages than the military wing in Gaza? Is that fair?
*09:11.180- 09:17.260* :  I don't know. And you know, the most fiery, hateful speeches are coming out of the leadership
*09:17.260- 09:23.520* :  outside of Gaza. I think that Palestinian people need to hold them to justice because these people
*09:23.520- 09:28.320* :  are provoking a war without paying the consequences for the war. It's very easy to make fiery
*09:28.320- 09:33.560* :  statements when you're sitting in luxury suites in Doha while your people are being bombed in Gaza
*09:33.980- 09:38.940* :  totally irresponsible. And I'm not sure that they are more willing to make an agreement or less
*09:38.940- 09:43.920* :  willing. I think they're irrelevant is what the bottom line needs to be. And that's how the world
*09:43.920- 09:48.780* :  needs to relate to them to stop giving them this platform of being able to speak on behalf of
*09:48.780- 09:53.660* :  their people who are they are directly responsible for bringing back 75 years.
*09:54.320- 09:57.500* :  Former Israeli negotiator Gershon Baskin.
*09:58.460- 10:04.040* :  Other news now. And for many voters in Argentina, the choice of president came down to the lesser
*10:04.040- 10:09.280* :  of two evils. Their options were Sergio Massa, the minister who's presided over a failing
*10:09.280- 10:14.760* :  economy, and Javier Miele, a right-wing populist known as Al-Loco, or the madman.
*10:18.140- 10:23.480* :  The truth is that neither of the two candidates represent me, but obviously I'm here because I
*10:23.480- 10:28.740* :  think it's a duty that we as citizens have to try to save the Republic. There's only one way to
*10:28.740- 10:38.580* :  save it. Coming here, not voting blank or invalidating our vote. It's difficult, very difficult.
*10:38.580- 10:44.760* :  In one year, our wages have dropped. Our purchasing power has dropped. Everything has dropped.
*10:45.160- 10:50.380* :  The views of some voters there. Well polling stations closed on Sunday evening, but as we record
*10:50.380- 10:57.380* :  this podcast, the results are not yet known. I asked Natalia Kasoy in Buenos Aires if we had any
*10:57.380- 11:03.400* :  indication of who might be ahead. I mean Javier Miele's headquarters in a hotel in central Buenos
*11:03.400- 11:09.480* :  Aires. And I was here also in the first round of the elections. And I can say if this is any
*11:09.480- 11:15.800* :  indication that the mood is different. If it was a bit somber at this time of the day, in the first
*11:15.800- 11:20.880* :  round, they look much more optimistic at this time of the day, in the second round of the elections.
*11:21.460- 11:27.140* :  That's the only indication I can give, but they look pretty optimistic. We're still waiting. We
*11:27.140- 11:32.880* :  need to wait for about a couple of hours for the results, the official results, which are the
*11:33.440- 11:38.340* :  ones we can actually talk about, or the other information that might be going around. And this
*11:38.340- 11:45.280* :  is different from other countries. It's not proper data can actually be used to tell what the
*11:45.280- 11:52.080* :  result of the election is. So this is the mood here. We'll see if it confirmed that Miele has an
*11:52.080- 11:57.020* :  edge. Yeah, because in the first round, he didn't do as well as expected, but the key will be
*11:57.760- 12:03.300* :  who the voters who backed the third candidate in that first round go for in this one.
*12:04.640- 12:09.100* :  Yeah, that's here. And the important thing here is that this candidate, she's a woman called
*12:09.100- 12:17.120* :  Patricia Bullridge from a center-right party called the Hunto Por el Gambio, an alliance of
*12:17.220- 12:24.000* :  center-right parties. And after Miele turned out to in second place in the first round,
*12:25.080- 12:31.180* :  she a couple of days later said she was backing Miele together with a political leader, Mauricio
*12:31.180- 12:37.840* :  Macri, who's a former president in Argentina. I think that might have been key in getting the support
*12:37.840- 12:43.500* :  of other people of her voters for her Miele. Natalia Kosoj in Buenos Aires.
*12:44.400- 12:49.200* :  The former first lady of the United States, Rosalind Carter, has died at the age of 96,
*12:49.200- 12:54.560* :  known for her work on mental health and conflict resolution. She was described by her husband,
*12:54.560- 13:00.820* :  the former president Jimmy Carter, as a source of guidance and encouragement. James Cook looks back
*13:00.820- 13:06.580* :  at her life. Rosalind Smith was just 18 when she married Jimmy Carter. She kept the books for the
*13:06.580- 13:11.700* :  family peanut farm in the small town of Plains, Georgia, while racing four children and nurturing
*13:11.700- 13:17.240* :  her husband's political ambitions. In the White House, Mrs. Carter was seen as the most influential
*13:17.240- 13:23.000* :  first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. I'm more political than Jimmy she once remarked. She attended
*13:23.000- 13:27.980* :  cabinet meetings, helped to craft policy and even travelled abroad as the president's emissary.
*13:27.980- 13:33.660* :  With all-burn hair, a soft southern accent and an understated style, the press nicknamed her
*13:33.660- 13:39.540* :  the Steel Magnolia. A supporter of gender equality, Rosalind Carter also focused on drug and
*13:39.540- 13:44.860* :  alcohol abuse and the elderly, but her biggest political achievement was landmark mental health
*13:44.860- 13:50.980* :  legislation enacted in 1980. James Cook and following the death of Rosalind Carter,
*13:51.480- 13:56.440* :  President Joe Biden said that the Carter's are an incredible family because they brought so much
*13:56.440- 14:02.240* :  grace to the office. India is the dominant power in world cricket,
*14:02.860- 14:08.580* :  and as host of this year's World Cup, they were expected to win it. But despite powering through
*14:08.580- 14:13.900* :  the tournaments India lost to Australia, well the defeat for India will come as a huge blow,
*14:13.900- 14:18.520* :  not just to the fans there, but to the Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi,
*14:18.520- 14:23.460* :  who has been using cricket to burnish his image ahead of elections next year. The final
*14:23.460- 14:28.740* :  event took place in a stadium named after him. I heard more from our South Asia regional editor
*14:28.740- 14:35.040* :  Anbar San Etirajan. More than a billion Indians would have been really hard-broken seeing this
*14:35.560- 14:41.240* :  defeat because everyone thought it was India's World Cup, and if you had seen the preparations,
*14:41.240- 14:46.680* :  there were huge screens set up on the beaches and in housing associations. In fact, the whole
*14:46.680- 14:51.980* :  country came to a standstill for the day, and then the Australian victory came as a big disappointment,
*14:51.980- 14:58.600* :  not only for Indian cricket fans, and also for many politicians. In fact, the Indian Prime Minister
*14:58.600- 15:03.960* :  Narendra Modi, he was there along with this right hand man. I mean, Shah, who is the interior
*15:03.960- 15:09.240* :  minister of India, then in fact I've been watching a lot of social media reaction how many people
*15:09.240- 15:14.960* :  are crying because cricket is more than just a game. It's a passion. It's a way of life in India.
*15:14.960- 15:20.840* :  That's why if you see some of the fans who came from, Indians came from like US and UK and
*15:20.840- 15:25.560* :  different parts of the world, taking loans, they wanted to be there in the final. They wanted to
*15:25.560- 15:30.780* :  be there. Part of this historic moment, it is not just happening at any other time. This is a time
*15:30.780- 15:36.000* :  for India's rise in the global stage, and then it did not happen. Yeah, tell us a bit more about how
*15:36.000- 15:43.320* :  Mr Modi has been using cricket ahead of the elections next year. In fact, some of the historians
*15:43.320- 15:48.080* :  were describing this as even though it is a cricket World Cup, it is BJP's cricket World Cup,
*15:48.500- 15:54.100* :  and in fact, this stadium, and it was renamed after him in 2021, the world's biggest cricket
*15:54.100- 15:59.740* :  stadium that became a controversy. It was the first time such kind of honor was given to a person
*15:59.740- 16:05.800* :  while still in office. So India was running the show, and Mr Modi himself would be seen with
*16:05.800- 16:11.920* :  the cricket players often. And if India had won the World Cup, the way they were organizing this event,
*16:12.400- 16:18.200* :  it would have been a big boost to Mr Modi's election prospects. In fact, one commentator
*16:18.200- 16:23.660* :  described this as a whole World Cup campaign as the biggest interactive election campaign,
*16:23.660- 16:28.480* :  because in India, cricket is just like religion. Our South Asia Regional Editor Anne Barassan
*16:28.480- 16:35.180* :  Etter Rajan. A bottle of whiskey has been bought for $2.7 million at Sotheby's in London.
*16:35.180- 16:41.040* :  It's the most expensive bottle of wine or spirits ever sold at auction. David Lewis has the story.
*16:41.760- 16:46.140* :  It's not unheard of for drinks prices here in Central London to be a little on the high
*16:46.140- 16:52.780* :  side, but the sale of this incredibly rare 1926, McCullough and Adami, takes it to a whole new level.
*16:52.780- 16:58.040* :  It's not clear what the anonymous bidder plans to do with their booze, but the numbers involved
*16:58.040- 17:05.000* :  are eye watering. A single measure of this whiskey with soda would be the equivalent of $100,000
*17:05.000- 17:13.160* :  and $5, presuming the earn of soda cost $5, or a mere $20,000 a sip of the straight stuff.
*17:13.460- 17:19.460* :  There were already big expectations for a bumper sale, a similar McCullough was sold in 2019
*17:19.460- 17:27.240* :  for $1.9 million. Johnny Fowl, head of whiskey at Sotheby's, explained just why the bottle could sell
*17:27.240- 17:34.900* :  for such big numbers. It's one of those bottles that through some sort of folklore or word of mouth
*17:34.900- 17:40.840* :  or mythology has become the most valuable bottle and everybody's looking for these particular things.
*17:41.140- 17:47.840* :  I tasted a tiny drop of this. It's very rich. It's got a lot of dried fruit as you would expect,
*17:47.840- 17:53.500* :  a lot of spice, a lot of wood. It's 60 years in dark European oak as you can see from the color.
*17:53.680- 17:57.860* :  It's not a whiskey to take lightly. It's a rich rich dram, but it is incredible.
*17:58.080- 18:04.400* :  There were 40 bottles in all of this particular vintage bottled in 1986 after six decades
*18:04.400- 18:09.900* :  maturing in oak sherry casks. The bottles were adorned in different ways. A couple displayed
*18:09.900- 18:15.900* :  no branding at all, a dozen were labeled by pop artist Sopeta Blake, 12 more, like this most
*18:15.900- 18:21.820* :  recent seller, designed by Italian painter Valeria Adami. It's not known just how many McCullough
*18:21.820- 18:28.360* :  Adami 1926 bottles still exist. One is said to have been destroyed in an earthquake in Japan in
*18:28.360- 18:35.600* :  2011 and it's believed at least one other has been opened and consumed already. Chinchin, David Lewis.
*18:38.560- 18:44.140* :  And still to come on the global news podcast, we constantly support it. But we need to
*18:44.140- 18:49.340* :  support our own families too. It's a matter of to be or not to be for our companies now.

*20:35.520- 20:40.480* :  Nigeria's prisons are dangerously overcrowded. The UN says they hold more than double the
*20:40.480- 20:44.820* :  number of inmates they were designed for. But now the Nigerian government has announced that more
*20:44.820- 20:49.640* :  than 4,000 prisoners have been released. The interior ministry said they'd been in detention
*20:49.640- 20:55.400* :  for not paying fines. Our Africa Regional Editor Richard Hamilton looked at the state of Nigeria's
*20:55.400- 21:00.840* :  prison system. When you lay on that person's life, it is just like the orange ice fish.
*21:05.120- 21:11.340* :  I feel bad. Patrick Moses was arrested for a crime he said he didn't commit. He spent six
*21:11.340- 21:17.840* :  years in detention without trial before a human rights group took up his case and secured his release.
*21:18.600- 21:24.980* :  In an interview with the BBC last year, he described cramped conditions, brutality by prison guards
*21:24.980- 21:33.260* :  and fellow inmates dying in their cell. People die every day, every day. And if you die,
*21:33.260- 21:38.720* :  the Uncoma opened the door even if it is in the night. Even if it is midnight, what does
*21:38.720- 21:42.880* :  Uncoma opened that door? You stay there with that dead body to the morning.
*21:43.460- 21:50.100* :  More than 50,000 inmates, that's about 75% of the prison population, are still awaiting trial
*21:50.100- 21:56.800* :  in Nigeria. Amnesty International has said that inmates are left for years in this pre-trial
*21:56.800- 22:03.220* :  limbo land in filthy overcrowded cells with adults and children often held together.
*22:04.200- 22:09.580* :  The pressure group says the toilets are just holes in the floor, and by the end of the day they
*22:09.580- 22:15.940* :  overflow, leading to the spread of diseases. Some prisoners are known as forgotten inmates,
*22:15.940- 22:20.880* :  as they never go to court, and no one knows how long their detentions will last,
*22:20.880- 22:26.680* :  because their case files have been lost. But since taking office in March,
*22:26.780- 22:33.240* :  President Bolotinubu has wasted no time in making rapid changes to Nigeria,
*22:33.940- 22:38.260* :  and easing the prison population is one of them. Richard Hamilton.
*22:39.320- 22:44.500* :  The tiny archipelago of Mayot sits off the coast of Africa, roughly midway between Madagascar
*22:44.500- 22:50.080* :  and Mozambique. It's a French overseas territory, but three-quarters of the population there lived
*22:50.080- 22:55.960* :  below the national poverty line. It's currently in the middle of a water crisis. Mayot is suffering
*22:55.960- 23:01.380* :  its worst drought in a quarter of a century, clean tap waters running out, so the French government
*23:01.380- 23:06.820* :  will, on Monday, begin sending 17 million litres of bottled water to the islands every month,
*23:06.820- 23:12.680* :  about two litres a person a day. Estelle Yosufa represents Mayot in the national assembly,
*23:12.680- 23:17.660* :  and she's in Paris at the moment. She told James Menendez about the crisis back home.
*23:18.480- 23:24.520* :  Currently, we have running water in our tap a few hours a week in Mayot. That water is
*23:24.940- 23:31.680* :  deemed drinkable, but local authorities demand that to boil it before, so that's the only thing
*23:31.680- 23:38.320* :  we are thinking about in Mayot, which is when is the water on, and when it's not, where can we
*23:38.320- 23:45.860* :  purchase some watering bottles? Extremely expensive. 70% of the population lives below poverty line,
*23:45.960- 23:52.540* :  so that does not solve the water that you need to clean, to cook, or to wash.
*23:52.680- 23:58.760* :  Why is there such a shortage of clean water? The situation has been increasingly difficult
*23:58.760- 24:05.120* :  in the past months, but we've had water cuts for years in Mayot. There's been a severe drought
*24:05.500- 24:11.440* :  over population because we have massive influx of migrants and the infrastructures producing
*24:11.440- 24:17.960* :  drinkable water haven't been able to follow the progression. These years and decades of
*24:17.960- 24:23.980* :  underinvestment. So millions of mineral water bottles are going to be handed out every month
*24:23.980- 24:28.560* :  as I understand it. I mean, that's not a sustainable solution, is it? If you're
*24:28.560- 24:33.520* :  insustainable in terms of the environment, I agree it is not sustainable. If you mean sustainable
*24:33.520- 24:39.020* :  in terms of allowing us to survive, yes, it is. That's really what we're talking about. We need to
*24:39.020- 24:44.820* :  have drinkable water distributed to the population because there is none. So yes, it is massively polluting
*24:44.820- 24:50.940* :  in terms of plastic, but we want the government that they need to come up with solutions where they
*24:50.940- 24:56.640* :  collect plastic that will be accumulating because of the distribution. I fail to see how
*24:56.640- 25:02.160* :  sustainability is not to distribute bottles of water to population that has no other way.
*25:02.320- 25:06.640* :  Just tell us a bit more about this problem of overpopulation. Why there are so many people
*25:07.100- 25:12.360* :  on Mayot at the moment? Where are the migrants coming from? The Mayot is in the heart of a conflict
*25:12.360- 25:17.460* :  with its neighbors, the commerce, and the commerce have sent their population in droves to come
*25:17.840- 25:23.980* :  and leave in Mayot. The infrastructures have not been able to follow the demographics. The whole
*25:23.980- 25:30.200* :  island is saturated, but then if you combine that with climate change where we have seen the patterns
*25:30.200- 25:37.680* :  of rains and also the cyclones roots changing in the region, then it's a deadly combination.
*25:37.680- 25:42.460* :  There are questions around whether or not Mayot will be habitable in the coming decades.
*25:42.540- 25:47.760* :  Is the government in Paris doing enough? I think that it is absolutely shameful that we're
*25:47.760- 25:53.080* :  French department where the government organizes some sort of humanitarian effort to distribute
*25:53.080- 25:59.080* :  water. That says a lot about the lack of consideration for our territory, which has been
*25:59.080- 26:04.040* :  screaming for help for decades. Estelle, you see the representative of Mayot in the French
*26:04.040- 26:09.600* :  National Assembly. Giant queues of trucks have built up on Poland's border with Ukraine because
*26:09.600- 26:15.520* :  of a protest by Polish truckers blocking all the key crossing points. The dispute is over Ukrainian
*26:15.520- 26:20.960* :  truck companies access to the European Union, and it comes two months after a serious falling
*26:20.960- 26:27.200* :  out between Ukraine and Poland over grain imports. Ukraine's president Zelensky recently acknowledged
*26:27.200- 26:32.360* :  that his nation's allies were tiring of the war, a shift in mood, which he called scary.
*26:32.800- 26:36.720* :  Our Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford reports from the border.
*26:39.680- 26:44.540* :  Stanislav climbs up into the cab of his truck and shows me where he's been living for over a
*26:47.360- 26:52.760* :  week now. Stuck on the road home to Ukraine, he's one of hundreds of Ukrainian
*26:52.760- 26:57.520* :  lorry drivers trapped by dispute with Polish truckers who are blockading the border.
*26:58.200- 27:03.140* :  It is another sign of tension with a key ally that worries Kyiv. In fact, it's called this
*27:03.140- 27:09.840* :  Polish protest, a stab in the back. Stanislav radios up the queue for news.
*27:10.860- 27:17.820* :  He's told they're moving nowhere. The line of lorry's now stretches for 20 kilometers,
*27:18.600- 27:23.280* :  and Stanislav tells me his supplies, his cash, and his patients are running out.
*27:26.420- 27:30.260* :  People's nerves in this queue are really fraying. We can't take much more.
*27:30.980- 27:38.140* :  Is this how Poland helps us? What can I say? Thank you Polish people for this help.
*27:41.880- 27:47.480* :  We drove all the way up the queue to the roadblock, and the Polish truckers who were just as
*27:47.480- 27:54.840* :  frustrated and just as forthright. Paweł Zygawa tells me ever since Ukrainian truckers were
*27:54.840- 28:01.040* :  allowed into the EU with no limits, Polish firms have been losing out. The measure was meant to
*28:01.040- 28:06.960* :  help Ukraine during the war, but Paweł says his business has lost tens of thousands of euros.
*28:09.480- 28:15.360* :  We constantly support Ukraine, but we need to support our own families too. It's a matter of
*28:15.360- 28:26.780* :  to be or not to be for our companies now. The protesters are letting food through. This truck is
*28:26.780- 28:35.400* :  full of bananas, and military aid to Ukraine is way through too. But otherwise they've choked
*28:35.400- 28:41.360* :  the traffic flow to a couple of trucks an hour in each direction. It is a dramatically different
*28:41.360- 28:47.440* :  place to when hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians crossed here as refugees welcomed by Poland,
*28:47.440- 28:56.500* :  which saw Russia's invasion as a direct threat to them too. Just across the fields from the
*28:56.500- 29:01.560* :  truck protest, the village shopkeeper told me help people had taken Ukrainians into their homes then,
*29:01.740- 29:07.200* :  collecting clothes for them and food. And she thinks that solidarity is still strong.
*29:09.460- 29:13.380* :  But I found other villagers lukewarm now at best about their neighbour.
*29:15.640- 29:23.600* :  Yolanda told me she'd had enough of helping Ukrainians. And Sophia agreed she blames tough times
*29:23.600- 29:32.380* :  here in Poland itself for that. That's hard to hear for men from a country at war that can't
*29:32.380- 29:39.320* :  afford to get tired of defending itself. Right now though, the Ukrainian drivers tell me they just
*29:39.320- 29:46.760* :  want to get home. The talks on ending this protest, though, are going nowhere, just like the long
*29:46.760- 29:55.700* :  line of trucks. Sarah reinsered reporting. Now he's been called the father of English literature,
*29:55.700- 30:00.560* :  but some of Jeffrey Chaucer's most famous work is, how should we say, a little racy.
*30:01.060- 30:05.800* :  Too racy, in fact, for some Victorian audiences who rewrote parts of the Canterbury
*30:05.800- 30:11.300* :  tales for younger readers. Now some of those amended stories are going on display in a new exhibition
*30:11.300- 30:17.020* :  in Oxford, as Keras' made-ments reports. Over the last few years, we've seen many a discussion
*30:17.020- 30:22.420* :  on whether some English literature classics should be made more 21st century friendly.
*30:23.060- 30:27.900* :  Roald Dahl, Agatha Christie and Ian Fleming are just some of the authors whose work has been
*30:27.900- 30:33.000* :  up for debate, and whether including content warnings or rewriting passages considered offensive
*30:33.000- 30:39.220* :  is the best way forward. Well, a new exhibition at the Bodleian Library in Oxford shows that such
*30:39.220- 30:45.180* :  editing is an age-old practice. Even medieval poet Jeffrey Chaucer thought to be one of the
*30:45.180- 30:50.300* :  founding fathers of English literature has had his Canterbury tales censored over centuries.
*30:51.140- 30:56.500* :  Women taking pleasure in extramarital affairs, deceit and even flatulence are just some of the
*30:56.500- 31:01.160* :  character traits in his work to have been altered, especially during the 19th century.
*31:01.960- 31:05.980* :  According to Professor Marion Turner, curator of the Chaucer here and now exhibition,
*31:05.980- 31:10.960* :  it was the morality and religious aspects of his writing that were thought to be valuable for
*31:10.960- 31:16.620* :  Victorian children to hear. Many of the adaptations were therefore made by female writers with
*31:16.620- 31:21.140* :  children and mothers in mind when it came to that all-important bedtime story.
*31:22.460- 31:26.320* :  So what can we learn from these different examples of Chaucer's work? Aside from the
*31:26.320- 31:31.880* :  fact that passing wind was a no-go in Victorian children's literature. Well, for historian Mary
*31:31.880- 31:37.360* :  Beard, a glimpse into our past could help resolve debates in our present. Cultures have been
*31:37.360- 31:44.000* :  doctrine texts and counselling people as long as there's been culture. Socrates was put to death
*31:44.240- 31:48.680* :  two and a half thousand years ago, the same things people didn't want to hear, and as soon as we
*31:48.700- 31:53.820* :  get a more historical perspective on this, I think the better we'll be able to kind of handle it,
*31:54.780- 31:57.500* :  and who knows what's in store for Chaucer in years to come.
*31:58.080- 32:01.560* :  But Professor Turner remains hopeful that in displaying these different versions,
*32:01.620- 32:08.100* :  it shows the power of readers to create new, vibrant things of wonder, inspired by the past.
*32:08.580- 32:09.360* :  Charis-Madement
*32:10.380- 32:15.120* :  One of Emperor Napoleon's distinctive hats has sold at auction in France for almost two
*32:15.120- 32:20.700* :  million euros, three times the original estimate. The black-felt bicorn dates back to the
*32:20.700- 32:27.800* :  early 19th century as Danny Eberhardt reports. It was an auction, low in tat, high in hat.
*32:33.780- 32:39.040* :  We have one and a half million in the room. One and a half million for Napoleon's hat.
*32:39.040- 32:45.520* :  We are leaving it at one and a half million for this major Napoleonic symbol. I'm selling for
*32:45.520- 32:54.200* :  one and a half million, no regrets sold. The hammer price was over 1.6 million dollars,
*32:54.760- 33:00.080* :  more with commission, for the black-felt bicorn adorned with Cocade in the colors of the French
*33:00.080- 33:05.180* :  tree-colour. The Emperor himself might have applauded knowing that, at least in euros,
*33:05.180- 33:09.560* :  it was a world record for a headpiece. Shappel, you might say.
*33:10.560- 33:14.840* :  Though slightly faded, it's in remarkably good condition for a hat stating back more than
*33:14.840- 33:20.960* :  200 years. A number of Napoleon's hats have survived, though only a few are in private hands.
*33:21.840- 33:27.140* :  Fascination with the diminutive, but, depending on your perspective, great man, seems as keen as
*33:27.140- 33:32.420* :  ever, with a major Hollywood biopic hitting the screens, itself wreathed in controversy.
*33:36.820- 33:40.740* :  And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
