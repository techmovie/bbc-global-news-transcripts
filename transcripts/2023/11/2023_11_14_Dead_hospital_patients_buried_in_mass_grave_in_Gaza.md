*01:34.180- 01:39.740* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday the 14th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:40.380- 01:45.860* :  The director of a Gaza hospital says staff have been forced to bury dead patients in a mass grave.
*01:46.620- 01:50.040* :  Israel confirms the death of a teenage woman kidnapped by Hamas.
*01:52.960- 01:58.220* :  Also in this podcast, Slovenian politicians are hailing a good news story of regeneration in the
*01:58.220- 02:04.340* :  capital, but not all local people agree. The authorities in South Korea take drastic action to
*02:04.340- 02:10.600* :  help students at exam time and we have the solutions, but the crisis is still getting worse
*02:10.600- 02:16.320* :  faster than we're implementing them. A former U.S. Vice President on the challenges of tackling
*02:16.320- 02:25.940* :  climate change in Africa. We start in Gaza, where the territory's main hospital is now
*02:25.940- 02:32.100* :  burying dead patients in a mass grave. The director of Al Shifa Medical Facility says there's no longer
*02:32.100- 02:38.640* :  electricity for mugs to function and 179 people, including babies, have been buried in the grounds
*02:38.640- 02:44.540* :  of the hospital. Juliet Tumor, who is the spokeswoman for the United Nations Agency for Palestinian
*02:44.540- 02:52.640* :  refugees, known as UNRA, told the BBC that supplies of fuel had run out. We do not have fuel as of
*02:53.040- 03:01.340* :  this hour. UNRA does not have fuel. UNRA has not received any fuel from outside of Gaza.
*03:02.100- 03:10.460* :  Since the war began on the 7th of October, and yes, we are on the verge of becoming non-operational
*03:10.460- 03:17.860* :  if we do not get an urgent shipment of fuel. While our correspondent in Gaza, Rushdie Abu Alouf has
*03:17.860- 03:23.800* :  been reporting daily on the war for five weeks now, and he joined me on the line from Khan Unis in
*03:23.800- 03:29.480* :  the south of the territory. They decided this morning the Hamas Run Health Ministry at the director
*03:29.480- 03:37.240* :  of the hospital told the BBC that 170 people were buried in this morning. We have one of the
*03:37.240- 03:42.480* :  remaining journalists inside the hospital. We managed to communicate with him this morning while the
*03:42.480- 03:49.640* :  process of burying 170 people were going on. They said it's a small garden or courtyard of the
*03:49.640- 03:55.160* :  hospital. They have to dig with their hands and very little equipment they have, because they
*03:55.160- 04:00.120* :  said there is 70 bodies were in the morgue and about 100 bodies were in the ground of the hospital
*04:00.120- 04:05.180* :  for the last 48 hours, and they couldn't get them out. Situation remained the same around this
*04:05.180- 04:12.060* :  the shape of a hospital with tanks around it from four directions, and this morning there was an
*04:12.060- 04:18.820* :  airstrike nearby and few civilizations according to our contact inside the hospital. He said it's
*04:18.820- 04:25.060* :  very dangerous situation. Axis in and out of the hospital is extremely difficult and dangerous.
*04:25.060- 04:30.920* :  He said because many tanks are around and there was some fighting overnight, they said doctors are
*04:30.920- 04:38.380* :  trying to keep the babies warm because today this morning it was raining and Gaza will the
*04:38.380- 04:46.180* :  temperature still good about 25-24 degrees during the day, but at the night and early morning it gets
*04:46.320- 04:51.120* :  cold. The rescue just to be clear the situation is so dangerous outside according to the
*04:51.120- 04:56.040* :  medics inside and the Hamasaran ministry that they can't leave to bury these dead children,
*04:56.040- 05:00.180* :  these dead people and they have to turn to mass graves inside. That is what is happening.
*05:00.620- 05:06.240* :  Yes, that's what we understand. The situation is very dangerous yesterday. Morning about four
*05:06.240- 05:10.360* :  people were trying to flee the hospital. They were shot in their legs and they said medical
*05:10.360- 05:17.560* :  team have to risk their life and drag them inside for treatment. He said the job for the doctors
*05:17.560- 05:22.620* :  is really difficult because there is no fuel and all the generators in the hospital are down,
*05:23.100- 05:28.540* :  no electricity, no fuel, no water, no enough food for the people who are there and also no
*05:28.540- 05:34.900* :  internet. Getting information from Gaza City and the North is extremely difficult because most
*05:34.900- 05:39.840* :  of the internet lines are down and the communication is really bad and very hard to verify
*05:40.480- 05:45.840* :  a lot of these information that we are reporting from around the Sheffan Hospital.
*05:46.480- 05:51.600* :  So that is the view of the United Nations and the continued reporting from the ground in Gaza,
*05:52.020- 05:56.640* :  from our correspondent Rushdi Abu Aluf. Well, the Israeli military has consistently said it cannot
*05:56.640- 06:03.020* :  ignore hospitals in Gaza in its ongoing campaign to eliminate Hamas. Since the group stormed
*06:03.020- 06:08.040* :  into southern Israel on October 7th, killing more than 1200 people, most of them civilians.
*06:08.700- 06:12.720* :  Our correspondent Mark Lohan is in southern Israel. I spoke to him and asked him what are the
*06:12.720- 06:17.600* :  Israeli authorities there saying about why hospitals have been targeted? Well, they of course
*06:17.600- 06:22.020* :  maintain that they are not targeting the medical facility for the sake of being a hospital,
*06:22.020- 06:29.220* :  but because they say it conceals Hamas tunnels and Hamas command centres and they release pretty
*06:29.220- 06:35.820* :  detailed photos and videos which they say shows Hamas tunnel shafts areas that potentially
*06:35.820- 06:42.740* :  Hamas have held people hostage with a rope next to a chair, babies bottles, but also explosives
*06:42.820- 06:46.800* :  and weapons. So they maintain that that is the reason why they're targeting the hospital
*06:47.540- 06:51.860* :  and actually I just spoke to the deputy mayor of Jerusalem. We have intelligence that they've
*06:51.860- 06:56.720* :  got fuel for two to three months hidden under there whilst they leave their people like cowards
*06:56.940- 07:01.800* :  on top of something they created. That is the saddest and most tragic thing. While the hospital
*07:01.800- 07:06.080* :  is saying that they are very very shorter fuel and that is why they're having to turn off incubators
*07:06.080- 07:11.420* :  and respirators, the Israelis are saying well they should go and ask their own people, Hamas for
*07:11.420- 07:14.620* :  the fuel that is stored underneath their hospital. Of course, Hamas denies that. Well, these
*07:14.620- 07:19.440* :  radio authorities are saying that one of the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th has died
*07:19.440- 07:24.600* :  apparently in an air strike. What do you know about that? Yeah, this was a video that emerged overnight
*07:24.600- 07:30.720* :  first of all from Hamas that the an Israeli female soldier identified as Noah Marciano
*07:31.480- 07:36.340* :  was killed in an Israeli air strike on the 9th of November and the Israelis have now
*07:36.860- 07:41.140* :  officially confirmed and informed the family of that fallen soldier that she died.
*07:41.980- 07:47.440* :  Now there are still almost 240 people who are being held hostage by Hamas since the 7th of October.
*07:47.440- 07:54.400* :  There has frequently been talk of progress in a hostage release deal over the last few days and
*07:54.400- 07:59.520* :  weeks, but actually that hasn't come to fruition. Now as we understand it, there are ongoing talks
*07:59.520- 08:06.300* :  at a fairly advanced stage about potentially freeing up to 100 women and children held captive
*08:06.300- 08:10.760* :  by Hamas and its affiliates in Gaza in return for a similar number of Palestinian prisoners being
*08:10.760- 08:16.940* :  freed. But once again, those talks have not been finalized and we awake a progress report on
*08:16.940- 08:22.040* :  where we are with that. Mark Lohan ending our reporting from Israel and Gaza. Now let's get back
*08:22.040- 08:27.140* :  to a story that we have been reporting on over the past few days. Construction workers stuck in
*08:27.140- 08:32.760* :  a tunnel on the Indian side of the Himalayas after a partial collapse. Rescuers there were in
*08:32.760- 08:39.360* :  radio contact with them yesterday and pumping oxygen in to keep the 40 or so men alive. Zubeh Ahmed
*08:39.360- 08:45.420* :  is in Delhi, he has the latest. Food, water and oxygen and other stuff are being supplied to them
*08:45.420- 08:51.820* :  through a pipe and they seem to be in good spirits as of now, but you know, there are relatives
*08:51.820- 08:57.520* :  and co-workers waiting outside. It's been a long wait for them and they are getting more and more
*08:57.520- 09:06.440* :  anxious because all the efforts to remove the debris despite working for 60 hours non-stop has failed
*09:06.960- 09:12.860* :  and therefore their anxiety has increased. But what we are hearing from the officials who are
*09:12.860- 09:20.540* :  present on the ground is that the rescue teams are going to push a concrete pipe of 900 mm diameter
*09:21.180- 09:27.740* :  by boring a hole into the concrete heap of the debris and then hoping that the trapped workers
*09:28.340- 09:35.320* :  would squeeze through the pipe and the rescue teams have already erected a platform.
*09:35.320- 09:40.460* :  The work has not started, the new strategy has not been put in place but all preparations
*09:40.860- 09:45.900* :  are afoot to ensure that. That sounds like it will take some time. It will
*09:46.800- 09:54.880* :  the officials who are present there, the rescue teams are a local stringer correspondent spoke to,
*09:55.180- 10:02.440* :  he seems to have suggested to him that it might take a couple of days because the concrete is a mix
*10:02.580- 10:13.560* :  of blasters and mangled steel and iron and rocks and therefore to bore a hole is going to take time
*10:13.560- 10:19.700* :  and they are still preparing for it and they have got a machine which will drill a hole
*10:20.080- 10:25.860* :  and that machine has been brought in now and a work might start today later in the evening.
*10:26.300- 10:30.320* :  But in the meantime they are confident that they can communicate with these people the food
*10:30.320- 10:35.840* :  and oxygen that they are confident they are going to be okay because it sounds to me like maybe
*10:35.840- 10:40.020* :  this is going to be longer than they had anticipated. It is taking much longer because what is
*10:40.020- 10:45.160* :  happening is when they are trying to remove the debris they removed 20 meters of debris but
*10:45.700- 10:52.340* :  more and more debris still falling from all sides the debris is spread over a long stretch of
*10:52.380- 10:59.220* :  the tunnel three to four hundred meters and they believe that this food probably take much longer
*10:59.720- 11:06.340* :  while communications are still there with the people trapped inside and food and oxygen are
*11:06.340- 11:13.420* :  still being supplied. Zubair Ahmed in Delhi here in the UK a secret report seen by the BBC says
*11:13.420- 11:18.320* :  a senior police officer involved in the landmark case of the racist murder of the teenager
*11:18.320- 11:24.500* :  Stephen Lawrence 30 years ago was corrupt. Ray Adams was cleared by a corruption probe which
*11:24.500- 11:29.220* :  relied on false testimony from a man linked to the family of one of Stephen's killers.
*11:29.940- 11:35.920* :  The 18 year old black man was murdered by a group of young white men in 1993. A public inquiry
*11:35.920- 11:41.260* :  which followed said London's police were institutionally racist and led to big changes in
*11:41.260- 11:46.140* :  their management and the way that members of the public here viewed them. Daniel DeSimone reports.
*11:46.800- 11:51.480* :  This report says the informant must have been coached by Ray Adams or another officer
*11:51.920- 11:56.080* :  and this amounted to flagrant acts of attempting to pervert the course of justice.
*11:56.640- 12:01.600* :  The informant who has murdered two years before Stephen Lawrence was known to have associated with
*12:01.600- 12:07.480* :  the family of one of Stephen's killers David Norris. Commander Adams once ran criminal
*12:07.480- 12:12.820* :  intelligence for the entire Met and gave evidence at the public inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence
*12:12.820- 12:18.840* :  murder. A lawyer for Stephen's family says he's shocked by the new revelations and now wants
*12:18.840- 12:23.900* :  a full investigation into whether Ray Adams could have affected the botched murder investigation.
*12:24.980- 12:29.080* :  Ray Adams says he has asked the Met to investigate the allegations against him.
*12:29.080- 12:34.360* :  The force says it will review material before deciding whether any further action is required.
*12:34.360- 12:38.720* :  Daniel DeSimone reporting. Now, spare a thought for students in South Korea
*12:39.180- 12:45.240* :  sitting the National University entrance exam. The notoriously difficult test lasts for eight hours
*12:45.780- 12:49.540* :  and has been blamed for a range of social problems from poor mental health,
*12:49.540- 12:54.380* :  to plummeting fertility. To help the 18 year olds taking them this year, the authorities will
*12:54.380- 12:59.340* :  briefly ban flights. Our Asia Pacific editor Mickey Brister told me why.
*13:00.100- 13:08.580* :  Well, specifically this flight ban for 35 minutes, specifically between 1.05 pm and 1.40 pm
*13:08.580- 13:14.700* :  on Thursday the day of the exam. Now, they've chosen that time because that's when students will be
*13:14.700- 13:20.100* :  in their listening part of their English test and obviously the authorities don't want anything
*13:20.100- 13:29.300* :  to disturb their ability to hear what the text of what the exam questions are. A series of
*13:29.300- 13:35.680* :  other measures as well, banks, public offices all start late to allow the students to get to their
*13:35.680- 13:43.360* :  exam centres on time. So really, it's an indication of how much pressure is put on children,
*13:43.360- 13:50.120* :  how much importance is put on these tests. They not only allow students to get into university,
*13:50.120- 13:55.120* :  they then determine which university they get to and that can determine their whole lives. So
*13:55.120- 14:01.720* :  so much is dependent on this one one day in these pupils lives. Just briefly Mickey, I'm not going
*14:01.720- 14:05.640* :  to ask you to give us any answers, but it's an annual process. How difficult are some of the questions?
*14:06.840- 14:11.260* :  Really difficult. In fact, earlier this year, the authorities said they were going to end the
*14:11.260- 14:17.940* :  listing of some killer questions. I had a look at one question on the English paper a couple of
*14:17.940- 14:23.140* :  years ago and that said they had students had to find an answer, a definition to a phrase,
*14:23.520- 14:28.100* :  we find in ignorance, a really complicated phrase in English. So how gives you a flavour
*14:28.100- 14:32.860* :  of just how difficult they are? That sounds horrible. Mickey Bristo there.
*14:33.900- 14:38.740* :  Now, sperm whales in the Caribbean have a new protected reserve to live in, which should shield
*14:38.740- 14:44.580* :  them from fishing nets, noise and other pollution. It's hoped around 200 whales will benefit from
*14:44.580- 14:49.920* :  the move, the first in the world reportedly, by the government of the island of Dominica. Alfie
*14:58.360- 15:02.860* :  Habishan has more. They stretch up to 20 meters long and use this distinctive clicking sound to
*15:02.860- 15:07.940* :  communicate with relatives thousands of kilometers away. The underwater sound is so powerful,
*15:07.940- 15:14.340* :  it could burst a nearby human eardrum. But many other things about the sperm whale remain a mystery.
*15:15.080- 15:20.240* :  They have the largest brain of any animal in the world, and scientists are yet to understand the
*15:20.240- 15:26.700* :  purpose of its long blunt head, filled with a waxy substance called spermaceti. But now for the first
*15:26.700- 15:32.720* :  time they will have their own reserve, with nearly 800 square kilometers of ocean kept free from
*15:32.720- 15:38.360* :  large ships and commercial shipping on the western coast of the Caribbean island of Dominica.
*15:38.840- 15:43.940* :  The conservationist and national geographic explorer in residence Enrich Selah said it was a great
*15:43.940- 15:50.520* :  moment for the island. Dominica has three opportunities, one, to preserve, to restore the abundance of
*15:50.520- 15:54.900* :  a population of sperm whales that are critically in danger, two, with the restoration of the whales,
*15:54.900- 16:00.300* :  the more whales, the more carbon sequestration. So help Dominica to become climate resilient.
*16:00.300- 16:08.180* :  And three, they have an opportunity to develop one of the best run and regulated well-watching
*16:08.180- 16:12.760* :  operations in the world. The sperm whale population is now making a slight recovery,
*16:12.760- 16:18.120* :  having plummeted by over 70 per cent as a result of being hunted for their spermaceti,
*16:18.500- 16:22.700* :  which was used in oil lamps and candles, a practice which dates back centuries.
*16:23.520- 16:27.700* :  Today, the biggest dangers they face come from fishing gear and plastic trash.
*16:28.380- 16:32.860* :  But the authorities hope this new sperm whale reserve can replace money lost on the fishing industry,
*16:32.860- 16:38.620* :  boosting a new tourism industry which will pay for itself, leaving the local community of
*16:38.640- 16:47.220* :  200 sperm whales free to clip in peace. Alfie Habeson with the help of some whales.
*16:49.900- 16:54.540* :  Coming up in this podcast. My first day's work was being the world's first
*16:54.540- 16:59.180* :  quidditch player. We put a broomstick on the back of a truck and drove it down the runway
*16:59.180- 17:03.940* :  at Leafs and Studios with Chris Columbus looking down a camera lens,
*17:03.980- 17:08.160* :  whooping and hollering saying, yes, I think this is how we're going to be quidditch.
*17:08.440- 17:13.200* :  We hear about the extraordinary friendship between a stuntman and the actor who plays Harry Potter.
*17:21.380- 17:26.080* :  Flexibility is great. That's why there's yoga. Flexibility for your insurance coverage is great too.
*17:26.440- 17:30.500* :  That's why there's United Healthcare Insurance Plans. Underwritten by Golden Roll Insurance

*18:31.620- 18:35.520* :  and situations. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Now, the authorities in the Slovenian
*18:35.520- 18:40.480* :  capital, Ljubljana, have been promoting what they see as a good news story for the city,
*18:40.900- 18:46.700* :  the transformation of an old factory into a new creative centre. But the development has enraged
*18:46.700- 18:51.860* :  those who are using the decaying facility. They accuse officials of destroying an entire
*18:51.860- 18:57.240* :  artistic community in the process. A Balkan's correspondent, Guadalani, has been hearing from
*18:57.240- 19:00.420* :  both sides in what has become an incendiary culture war.
*19:05.580- 19:10.920* :  It's the opening night of centre-rog and the scores of people beating drums. They're
*19:10.980- 19:17.160* :  outraged at the demise of the old autonomous centre which used to be in the formerly derelict
*19:17.160- 19:22.860* :  factory here, where people could pretty much do their own thing. The autonomous factory
*19:22.860- 19:29.220* :  rock was a really interesting social experiment, enabling spaces for people working,
*19:29.220- 19:32.900* :  creating stuff that they wouldn't have found anywhere else in the city.
*19:32.900- 19:38.620* :  Miloš Kossets is a professor of architecture and campaigner against gentrification in Ljubljana.
*19:38.620- 19:44.240* :  He says the eviction of the old rock factory squat was a major loss to the city.
*19:44.360- 19:50.040* :  I really don't understand why these social and artistic practices that were really up to date
*19:50.080- 19:55.820* :  and interesting and added a lot to this city when missing and when missing in quite a violent way.
*19:59.100- 20:04.500* :  Centre-rog doesn't exactly look elitist right now. There's a workshop here in the cooking lab
*20:04.880- 20:11.400* :  for children to make sweets with edible packaging. The people who run rock insisted the idea behind
*20:11.400- 20:16.180* :  transforming the derelict factory. It was to create facilities accessible to all,
*20:16.180- 20:23.460* :  when not as in MEDA, as the director general. We aspire to be the creative engine of the city
*20:23.460- 20:31.420* :  and even broader, facilitating the ones who want to create and bring their ideas into products
*20:32.180- 20:38.100* :  in various fields of, let's say, handicraft to very advanced technologies.
*20:38.440- 20:40.640* :  Who are you trying to get through the doors here?
*20:40.840- 20:50.880* :  Our nine production labs will facilitate amateur makers, but also professional designers and creators.
*20:54.160- 20:58.700* :  But is there any way that the new centre-rog and those who mourn the demise of the old
*20:58.700- 21:05.340* :  rogue autonomous factory can be reconciled? Renata Zameda and Milosh Kossets both believe this hope.
*21:05.760- 21:12.900* :  I hope that we will be able to show in the future that we are a very, very open institution
*21:13.100- 21:17.140* :  and that everyone can come to us.
*21:17.140- 21:22.600* :  We need the rock factory in one way or another, but we need it in a specific way,
*21:22.640- 21:26.840* :  in a way that it will make creative life in this city better, not worse.
*21:30.440- 21:35.620* :  The conflict may have died down for now, but this is one culture war that remains unresolved.
*21:39.640- 21:43.940* :  Guadalani reporting. Now the former U.S. Vice President Al Gore
*21:44.380- 21:49.840* :  turned full-time global environmental campaigner has said that the developed world has failed to
*21:49.840- 21:55.340* :  meet the crucial targets agreed upon at COP27. He says it's led to the worsening of the climate
*21:55.340- 22:01.020* :  change crisis on a daily basis. In preparation for the forthcoming COP28 in Dubai,
*22:01.020- 22:05.960* :  Mr Gore said that the fossil fuel industry has taken charge of the global effort
*22:05.960- 22:11.840* :  to reach net zero emissions. The BBC's Thomas Nadi has been speaking to him at an event in Accra
*22:11.840- 22:18.600* :  in Ghana. One of the problems that has to be solved is we have allowed the fossil fuel
*22:18.620- 22:26.280* :  industry to gain control of the process. This upcoming COP28 in Dubai
*22:27.300- 22:33.420* :  ignited as the president of the COP, the CEO of one of the biggest and dirtiest oil companies
*22:33.420- 22:38.380* :  on the planet, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. He's a very nice guy. I've known him for years.
*22:38.380- 22:45.520* :  He's a very smart guy, but his interests are to increase the production of fossil fuels,
*22:45.660- 22:52.720* :  and it's absurd to put someone who is charged officially with expanding the production
*22:52.720- 22:59.120* :  of oil and gas by 50 percent in charge of a global effort that is intended to reduce the
*22:59.120- 23:05.960* :  emissions by 50 percent. It's a direct conflict of interest. The people have to regain control
*23:06.660- 23:10.340* :  of this agenda. Where are we with a climate situation now?
*23:11.020- 23:19.500* :  Well, the climate crisis is still getting worse faster than we are deploying the solutions.
*23:19.500- 23:25.740* :  We have the solutions, but the crisis is still getting worse faster than we're implementing them.
*23:27.500- 23:34.420* :  Part of the reason is that the fossil fuel industry has been very skillful in
*23:35.260- 23:42.320* :  locking countries into dependence on fossil fuels and capturing the policy-making process.
*23:42.660- 23:47.640* :  They're much better. These companies are more efficient in capturing politicians than in capturing
*23:47.640- 23:55.320* :  their emissions. But the good news is that the cheapest electricity in the history of the world
*23:55.320- 24:02.400* :  is now the electricity coming from solar energy. And Africa has 60 percent of the solar
*24:02.400- 24:08.940* :  potential of the entire world. It's cheaper, it's cleaner, it's better. Wind energy is also
*24:09.580- 24:15.960* :  cheaper. Electric vehicles don't cause the air pollution that chokes the lungs of people who
*24:15.960- 24:22.840* :  live in cities. And of course, the air pollution is rising in Ghana, Acra is due to quadruple the
*24:22.840- 24:28.980* :  amount of air pollution in the next decade because of the surge and of trucks and cars,
*24:29.460- 24:33.720* :  unless the shift to electric vehicles is accelerated.
*24:34.660- 24:39.720* :  Al Gore speaking to the BBC in Ghana. Now the conflicting guards continue to generate
*24:39.720- 24:45.120* :  heated debate around the world, with public marches in support of Palestinians in many countries
*24:45.120- 24:50.700* :  from the United Kingdom to Indonesia. But a rise in anti-Jewish sentiment also led to a
*24:50.700- 24:56.060* :  demonstration in France at the weekend of more than 100,000 people in support of the Jewish
*24:56.060- 25:00.040* :  community to demonstrate opposition to anti-Semitic rhetoric.
*25:00.560- 25:06.000* :  The French far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon described the event as a rendezvous for unconditional
*25:06.660- 25:11.840* :  supporters of the massacre in Gaza. Several Jewish commentators have said that such comments
*25:11.840- 25:17.180* :  demonstrate how opposition to the Israeli military response in Gaza can easily turn into
*25:17.180- 25:22.960* :  expressing anti-Semitic hate. Well my colleague Victoria Oon Kunda has been speaking to Dr.
*25:22.960- 25:27.780* :  Alexandra Herzog of the American Jewish Committee. She is in Boston in Massachusetts.
*25:28.600- 25:33.380* :  Anti-Semitism has reached historic levels right now, really around the world.
*25:34.320- 25:42.860* :  We have seen about 388% of increase of anti-Semitic incidents in the last month,
*25:42.860- 25:50.500* :  which is completely insane to think about. And I think that it has even risen to a thousand
*25:50.500- 25:57.680* :  percent of increase on a daily average of violent messages mentioning Jews or Israel
*25:57.680- 26:02.220* :  in white supremacists as well as right-wing extremist channels.
*26:02.780- 26:06.680* :  And how does that make you feel all these rise the numbers are quite staggering?
*26:07.960- 26:13.900* :  They really are. And you know, I have to say that even before October 7, American Jews already
*26:13.900- 26:22.300* :  felt 91% of American Jews felt that anti-Semitism was a problem in America. I personally feel
*26:22.300- 26:28.460* :  very worried. I have been in a situation where I have received threats, where I have received
*26:28.460- 26:34.580* :  different types of insults. What do these messages or threats to you say?
*26:36.380- 26:42.720* :  That really a lot of the criticism that we usually hear about Israel is actually directing
*26:42.740- 26:48.840* :  against Jews. And I don't want to simplify things. You know, I think that rallies in general that
*26:48.840- 26:55.120* :  are pro-Palestinians are completely, completely okay and they should be expressed and they should
*26:55.120- 27:00.640* :  happen. And that's, they're very important. That being said, I think that oftentimes people
*27:01.280- 27:05.760* :  cross the line into anti-Semitic rhetoric. And this is what we're really seeing right now,
*27:06.260- 27:12.100* :  where the messaging is not so much about what's happening in this world, but rather real threats
*27:12.100- 27:18.080* :  to Jews. So, you know, we hear and we've heard in Australia gas the Jews. We have heard in different
*27:18.080- 27:24.220* :  countries similar things. In America, for example, people are having signs that say, you know,
*27:24.560- 27:31.580* :  world needs to be cleaned. And we see that with the start of David in garbage can. And they use
*27:31.580- 27:39.560* :  a lot of tropes that are ancient tropes. And those are coming back. And to me, signals really
*27:40.500- 27:48.120* :  fragility, a problem within those are democratic societies. It is, it signals a threat and we have
*27:48.120- 27:55.120* :  to be very, very careful and pay attention to it. Alexandra Herzogt speaking from Boston in the US.
*27:55.940- 28:00.220* :  Now, we're going to end this podcast on a story of friendship and support through unimaginable
*28:00.220- 28:05.660* :  circumstances. And at the heart of it is Harry Potter. If you've seen the movies, you would have
*28:05.660- 28:10.580* :  seen Daniel Radcliffe in the main role, but also David Holmes, his stunt double. He did the job
*28:10.580- 28:16.240* :  for nearly a decade until a horrific accident in rehearsals when he broke his neck. It left him
*28:16.240- 28:21.620* :  paralyzed from the chest down. His story and how the pair's friendship has helped him in the
*28:21.620- 28:27.200* :  aftermath of that accident is now the subject of a television documentary. Liza Mazumba spoke to
*28:27.200- 28:33.740* :  them both. My first day's work was being the world's first Quidditch player. We put a broomstick
*28:33.740- 28:39.100* :  on the back of a truck and drove it down the runway that leaves and studios with Chris Columbus
*28:39.880- 28:44.620* :  looking down a camera lens, whooping and hollering saying, yes, I think this is how we're going to do
*28:44.620- 28:54.700* :  Quidditch. The teenage David Holmes became Daniel Radcliffe's stand-in for the movies, doing stunts
*28:54.700- 29:01.840* :  deemed too risky for the film's young star. But in 2009, while rehearsing for the seventh film,
*29:01.840- 29:06.480* :  David was badly injured and permanently paralyzed from the chest downwards.
*29:06.980- 29:10.840* :  He's now the subject of a documentary about his life after the accident.
*29:11.260- 29:16.860* :  I've had a lot taken from me, but I still were able to see the beautiful things in life.
*29:17.220- 29:21.000* :  How did it feel reflecting on the last 10, 15 years?
*29:21.480- 29:27.720* :  I just want to be honest, you know, and honestly, yeah, living with a broken neck is hard. But I've
*29:27.720- 29:35.020* :  said before, breaking my neck made a man of me. And looking back, I'm very grateful that I've
*29:35.020- 29:40.620* :  managed to retain my sense of self. The documentary details how he's found such positivity,
*29:41.280- 29:45.520* :  thanks to his strong personality and a close group of friends surrounding him,
*29:45.520- 29:50.180* :  a group that includes Daniel Radcliffe. He was like my little brother on the films,
*29:50.260- 29:55.980* :  and then grew to be one of my best friends, you know, and we still talk like on a regular,
*29:56.340- 30:02.060* :  you know, whether it's me sending him houseplants for him moving into a new place,
*30:02.060- 30:08.000* :  or making playlists for him for when he's unpacking boxes, and he does the same for me.
*30:08.100- 30:11.140* :  He's always been there for me, and I've always been there for him.
*30:11.360- 30:13.200* :  Daniel Radcliffe says the same.
*30:13.200- 30:20.900* :  Dave still is one of the most important people in my life as he has been for the last like 20 years.
*30:21.500- 30:24.860* :  He was somebody that was so incredibly fun to hang out with when I was young,
*30:24.860- 30:30.980* :  but then as I grew up, became like a real guide to me and a mentor and someone who really looked
*30:30.980- 30:34.460* :  out for me. And that really has sort of just continued as we've grown.
*30:34.640- 30:39.620* :  As well as appearing in the documentary, Radcliffe was the person who instigated the project
*30:39.620- 30:45.260* :  and is an executive producer on the production. Dave has always been an extraordinary person
*30:45.720- 30:53.140* :  before and after the accident. And I want people to get to know my friend because he's so much fun,
*30:53.140- 31:01.180* :  he's so funny, he's so smart, he's so kind and so generous, and just like an amazing person
*31:01.180- 31:06.720* :  to be around. That's where I've wanted to like share Dave with the world for so long.
*31:06.960- 31:11.240* :  In life you're either a victim or a survivor, right? I choose to be a survivor.
*31:11.780- 31:18.200* :  And if that has a knock on effect for other people that live in with any hardships in life,
*31:18.300- 31:23.980* :  then that's got to be a positive thing. Right now, the world's not the nicest of places to
*31:24.440- 31:30.920* :  live in and spreading positive stories is a new good thing, right? You must be really proud that
*31:30.920- 31:37.860* :  you've helped raise tens of thousands of pounds for charity. Wonderful thing, right? Like a silver
*31:37.860- 31:43.520* :  lining on a very dark cloud. And to give back has always been important to me. David Holmes,
*31:43.520- 31:47.120* :  the Harry Potter you didn't know about ending that report by Lee's Amazon.
*31:50.380- 31:53.500* :  Well, that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast.
