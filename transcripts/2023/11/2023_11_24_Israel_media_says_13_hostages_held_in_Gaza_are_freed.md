*01:57.140- 02:03.900* :  I'm Rachel Rice and at 14.30 hours GMT on Friday the 24th of November these are our main stories.
*02:04.480- 02:10.120* :  Israel says 13 hostages held in Gaza are being released. The convicted murderer and South
*02:10.120- 02:16.360* :  African former athlete Oscar Pistorius is to be released from jail on parole. Taiwan's opposition
*02:16.380- 02:21.240* :  parties have failed to agree on a joint candidate for January's presidential election.
*02:25.000- 02:30.600* :  Also in this podcast high hopes that the 41 people trapped under a collapsed Indian tunnel
*02:30.600- 02:36.680* :  will soon be safe. These men were dancing to Diwali when they went in and I promise
*02:36.980- 02:42.200* :  they'll be home singing Christmas carols. I'm just not quite sure where between now and Christmas
*02:48.360- 02:52.700* :  they coming out. After seven weeks of relentless Israeli military action in Gaza following
*02:52.700- 02:58.620* :  the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October the 7th the guns fell silent. A temporary
*02:58.620- 03:04.520* :  truce between Israel and Hamas has been largely holding and as we record this podcast Israeli
*03:04.520- 03:11.300* :  media is reporting that the first 13 Israeli hostages women and children have been released in
*03:11.300- 03:16.900* :  the hands of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Her correspondent Anna Foster is in
*03:16.900- 03:22.600* :  the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. They say that they are on the move towards the wrath of crossing
*03:22.600- 03:27.120* :  that they have been handed over. Another of the main TV channels here as well and of course
*03:27.120- 03:32.340* :  remember that the Israeli networks they have very good contacts don't they with people within
*03:32.340- 03:37.120* :  the administration, within the military, within the government. Another is saying that the hostages
*03:37.120- 03:42.240* :  will actually come out through Raffa and then will return into Israel through the Nitzana
*03:42.240- 03:46.880* :  border crossing is one suggestion which means they would travel a little bit further before they
*03:46.880- 03:51.340* :  came back in again. You might be able to hide just the hubbub in the background here. People
*03:51.900- 03:56.020* :  are desperate for the word they're desperate for the official information I think as soon as
*03:56.020- 04:01.200* :  Israel know for sure that they're in a position to confirm this you know they will get it out there
*04:01.200- 04:06.220* :  straight away because the sense of anticipation you know people keep coming around here and
*04:06.620- 04:10.700* :  that they're watching pictures on the screen that they're waiting to hear what I'm saying,
*04:10.700- 04:15.040* :  listening to what you're saying to see if they can pick up any any tidbits of information.
*04:15.520- 04:20.080* :  It's really interesting how many people have come here and gathered I think for this moment in
*04:20.080- 04:26.160* :  the centre of Tel Aviv and in what has become known as hostages square and we know that the government
*04:26.260- 04:31.320* :  and they have released certain details about how this will happen about the way that the hostages
*04:31.320- 04:37.280* :  will be flown in helicopters from a military base to various hospitals to receive medical
*04:37.280- 04:42.540* :  treatment and also to be reunited with their families as well. I mean think for just a moment
*04:42.540- 04:48.380* :  those families who are in those hospitals just now who know that their loved ones are on the way
*04:48.380- 04:54.120* :  after having waited for nearly seven long weeks with no news about their condition, about how they
*04:54.120- 04:59.060* :  are even about you know whether or not they even survived and and for those people now these are
*04:59.060- 05:07.060* :  the last anxious minutes of waiting. Anna Foster in the Israeli City of Tel Aviv and a total of
*05:07.060- 05:12.600* :  50 Israeli hostages are set to be released over the next four days. Israel has confirmed it has a
*05:12.600- 05:18.100* :  list of names and has been contacting the families. In return it will release 39 Palestinian
*05:18.100- 05:26.620* :  prisoners today, 24 women and 15 teenage boys, the first of 150 Palestinian prisoners all together.
*05:27.880- 05:32.700* :  The convicted murderer and former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has been told he'll be released
*05:32.700- 05:38.840* :  on parole on the 5th of January next year. He's been serving a 13 year sentence for murdering
*05:38.840- 05:46.240* :  his girlfriend Riva Steenkamp in 2013. The decision to grant parole is controversial. Rob Matthews
*05:46.240- 05:52.280* :  is a spokesperson for the Steenkamp family. He said they were not convinced of Pistorius' rehabilitation.
*05:53.360- 05:59.580* :  My personal opinion is that part of that road to rehabilitation is acknowledging what you've
*05:59.580- 06:06.200* :  done and being accountable for what you've done and being man enough or person enough to say
*06:06.880- 06:11.800* :  I did it and all the consequences that go with it. Not just lip service because lip service is
*06:11.800- 06:20.120* :  easy. It's easy to say sorry when I've been caught. Your actions have to be completed with
*06:20.120- 06:27.300* :  deeds in the way you conduct your life and I think it's pertinent to taking to consideration the
*06:27.300- 06:33.780* :  conditions that have been given to Pistorius. I think that's quite important. Remember he's not a
*06:33.780- 06:37.940* :  life he did not get a life sentence. The rules for life sentences are very different.
*06:38.660- 06:44.360* :  Nick Miles spoke to the BBC's Daniel Dissimone at the prison just outside Pretoria where Pistorius
*06:44.360- 06:50.340* :  is being held. Oscar Pistorius prior to the crime was seen as an inspirational figure. He was a
*06:50.340- 06:55.960* :  global sporting superstar. He had both his lower legs and potatoes when he was less than a year old
*06:55.960- 07:01.580* :  but went on to be a very very successful Paralympic athlete, one in multiple Paralympic
*07:01.580- 07:07.200* :  golds, also competed against non-disabled athletes at London at 12 Olympics. But he then
*07:07.200- 07:13.820* :  shot a killed his girlfriend Riva Steenkamp in his home on Valentine's Day at 2013. The actual
*07:13.820- 07:20.500* :  details of the case then became really a huge news story for years really during the trial and
*07:20.500- 07:25.500* :  this subsequent appeal which saw him convicted of murder. He shot her through a toilet door multiple
*07:25.500- 07:29.740* :  times. He claimed he thought an intruder was in the house. He thought she was still in bed.
*07:30.620- 07:34.800* :  The prosecution said he knew what he was doing. He was ultimately convicted of murder.
*07:35.320- 07:40.260* :  And this was his first attempt at parole today. So he'd been given parole. It's quite unusual for
*07:40.260- 07:47.100* :  a parole to be granted despite never having admitted to the murder itself. And also the fact that
*07:47.100- 07:51.540* :  there was a victim impact statement from the mother saying that we don't think he is rehabilitated.
*07:51.980- 07:57.040* :  He didn't deny shooting Riva Steenkamp. What he denied was knowing that he was going to
*07:57.260- 08:02.060* :  shoot her. He claimed that he thought she was still in bed. The evidence was quite complicated
*08:02.060- 08:07.640* :  but the Supreme Court that convicted him was satisfied that he was an unreliable witness. He
*08:07.640- 08:13.580* :  given multiple accounts and that when he shot through that door he knew that he could be killing
*08:13.580- 08:18.920* :  someone who ever was behind that door. Riva Steenkamp's mother's statement did express a lot of
*08:18.920- 08:24.740* :  sketchism about his rehabilitation. Also she expressed concern about that he may present an
*08:24.740- 08:29.660* :  ongoing threat to women if his behaviour has not been addressed in prison. But she did not
*08:29.660- 08:35.300* :  formally oppose his release which may have been a factor in the fact that he has now been approved
*08:35.820- 08:40.480* :  for release. There will be conditions when he's released those include attending therapy sessions
*08:40.480- 08:44.960* :  deal with his anger and addressing issues around gender-based violence.
*08:45.740- 08:46.580* :  Daniel Dussamone
*08:47.540- 08:53.140* :  Taiwan's opposition parties which favour closer ties with China have failed to unite behind a single
*08:53.140- 08:59.140* :  candidate to fight January's presidential election. chaotic lastich talks broke down with
*08:59.140- 09:04.220* :  the two main opposition figures both saying that they would run for president. The turmoil within
*09:04.220- 09:09.420* :  the opposition camp has improved the chances of victory for the front runner Taiwan's current
*09:09.420- 09:15.960* :  vice president William Lai who favours closer ties with the West and this is of concern to China
*09:15.960- 09:22.820* :  as we heard from our Asia-Pacific editor Mickey Bristo. It seems on first sight that this is just an
*09:22.820- 09:29.920* :  internal political squabble the kind of squabble most countries have but it has far bigger ramifications
*09:30.080- 09:35.440* :  and that's because China considers Taiwan to be part of its own territory and as in fact not
*09:35.440- 09:40.600* :  we announce the use of force to kind of unify with the island. So it looks closely about which
*09:40.600- 09:46.760* :  candidates win now have the opposition been able to unify and come together under one candidate
*09:47.400- 09:51.820* :  then that candidate would have had a better chance of winning and so Taiwan's future would have
*09:51.820- 09:57.300* :  been perhaps closer to China and so there would have been less tension in the region and less tension
*09:57.880- 10:04.100* :  between China and the United States because Taiwan is a consistent issue between these two countries
*10:04.100- 10:10.420* :  because the United States supports Taiwan so that's why this election matters as you indicated
*10:10.420- 10:15.900* :  there William Lai the current vice president now has a slightly better chance of winning and he
*10:15.900- 10:22.160* :  is the opposite to the opposition candidates he favours the United States favours more independence
*10:22.160- 10:28.780* :  for Taiwan so if he gets in there's a chance that tension between China and Taiwan will continue
*10:29.240- 10:33.600* :  for several years to come. And that's even though Mr Lai says he favours the status quo he's not
*10:33.600- 10:38.840* :  going to formally announce independence Beijing is still worried. It is still worried it doesn't need
*10:38.840- 10:44.600* :  to really declare formal independence all he needs to do is position Taiwan as moving away from China
*10:44.600- 10:50.640* :  and China sees that as worrisome in itself and as I said it's not just a regional issue it draws
*10:50.640- 10:55.980* :  in the United States it means other regional issues are more difficult to solve as well so
*10:56.560- 11:02.240* :  really it's a squabble which you know has played out in Taiwan in full view of TV audiences but
*11:02.240- 11:08.120* :  it's a squabble which has bigger ramifications and go far beyond what happens just on the island
*11:08.120- 11:14.340* :  itself. Mickey Bristow speaking to Nick Miles the world's biggest iceberg is on the move after more
*11:14.340- 11:21.840* :  than 30 years being stuck to the ocean floor. A23A as it's officially called is almost 4,000 square
*11:21.840- 11:27.920* :  kilometers in area more than twice the size of Greater London. It's drifted rapidly in recent months
*11:27.920- 11:33.860* :  and is now about to move beyond Antarctic waters a science correspondent Jonathan Amos reports.
*11:34.600- 11:40.860* :  A23A is a true colossus and it's not just its width the slab of ice is thicker than the
*11:40.860- 11:48.420* :  shard skyscraper in London is tall it carved from the Antarctic coastline in 1986 at the time it
*11:48.420- 11:54.140* :  was hosting a Soviet research base. Scientists rushed in fearing their equipment would be lost but
*11:54.140- 11:59.260* :  it didn't move far its deep keel kept the berg anchored rigidly to the floor of Antarctica's
*11:59.260- 12:05.980* :  wedel sea. Almost four decades on and it started to drift unwrappedly it's not a climate response
*12:05.980- 12:12.480* :  just the natural order of things so scientists the coming weeks and months will see a23A sweep
*12:12.480- 12:19.220* :  towards the south Atlantic where the behemoth will gradually melt and wither away. Jonathan Amos
*12:22.460- 12:33.480* :  still to come there's no thought process it's just writing music I literally went into the studio
*12:33.480- 12:40.180* :  and I just started to write the symphony. Seeing a songwriter Joe Norma trading on swapping pop
*12:40.520- 12:42.500* :  for her very first classical symphony.
*12:53.820- 12:58.780* :  Hey BBC listeners you come to the global news podcast because you want to stay up to date on

*13:58.040- 14:05.480* :  you get to BBC Podcasts. Welcome back to the global news podcast. For nearly two weeks now 41
*14:05.480- 14:11.680* :  workers have been trapped inside a tunnel under a mountain in a remote part of the Himalayas in India.
*14:12.260- 14:17.180* :  A huge rescue effort is underway although there's been a setback with their main drilling machine.
*14:17.800- 14:22.500* :  Martha Carney spoke to one of the people running the rescue operation, Professor Arnold Dix,
*14:22.900- 14:27.080* :  who is president of the International Tunneling and Underground Space Association.
*14:27.900- 14:33.760* :  I'm sitting on top of an evacuation pipe, which is set in the side of a tunnel, which is about
*14:34.160- 14:41.260* :  17 metres wide. I'm looking at the place where we're building the emergency tunnels to try and
*14:41.260- 14:47.320* :  get the trap men out. To my right is a large crane that's lowering some organ bits and pieces of pipe
*14:47.360- 14:53.160* :  to push towards where the men are trapped. A median front of me is just piles of dirt and rubble
*14:53.520- 14:57.920* :  to my left. It looks a bit like a war zone or something with just equipment and everything
*14:57.920- 15:02.920* :  everywhere. We've got, I'd say at least 50 or 60 engineers and technicians and surveys and
*15:03.160- 15:08.960* :  everyone here busy preparing the equipment that failed yesterday. It ripped itself literally
*15:08.960- 15:14.700* :  out of the mountain. Just couldn't do the job. Are you able to tell me more about the machine of
*15:14.700- 15:19.920* :  what its purpose is and why it's failed? You don't have machines designed to
*15:20.600- 15:24.940* :  burrow their way through avalanches. What you do is you take a piece of technology that's
*15:25.060- 15:28.160* :  designed for something else and you see if you can burrow it through an avalanche.
*15:28.940- 15:33.460* :  So the particular machine in question is a what we call a pipe-jacking machine with an
*15:33.460- 15:38.040* :  auger attached. So an auger is like a big meat mince that goes backwards and it minces rock and
*15:38.040- 15:43.540* :  then brings the rock back out and then we push a sleeve of steel around the hole that it creates
*15:43.740- 15:47.400* :  and then that becomes a comparatively safe place to affect an emergency evacuation.
*15:48.420- 15:53.300* :  We've found extreme difficulties getting through the avalanche with any sized material because
*15:53.500- 15:58.120* :  in the avalanche between here and where the men are are huge machines that have been crushed
*15:58.120- 16:04.240* :  and debris and smashed beams and rocks and everything else. So technically the machine
*16:04.300- 16:09.200* :  it just couldn't do it and not only couldn't it do it it tried and it tore itself
*16:09.740- 16:14.000* :  literally out of the rock itself and then hurt the tunnel that we were trying to build to get
*16:14.000- 16:19.300* :  the people out. So we're all holding our breath here at the moment. If it fails and it's already
*16:19.300- 16:24.720* :  failed three times we've got other ways to get inside. They're just going to take even longer.
*16:25.440- 16:30.800* :  Soldiers are here as we speak, manufacturing further equipment that we're going to need if we
*16:30.800- 16:35.360* :  try and mine our way through. That would be if we fail later today with this attempt. All of the
*16:35.360- 16:40.620* :  people that I'm looking at including myself if we're honest are in extreme danger because the
*16:40.620- 16:44.980* :  avalanche that's already occurred has already crushed part of this tunnel but surveys telling me
*16:44.980- 16:49.160* :  everything is stable at the moment. I mean if we have an earthquake of course that will change and
*16:49.160- 16:53.080* :  you know there's lots of earthquakes in the Himalayas so that can happen any moment. I've gone up
*16:53.080- 16:57.000* :  and checked the face. I've gone and checked the crown. I'm satisfied that everything is stable at
*16:57.000- 17:02.580* :  the moment. We're good to proceed and we're amongst the sort of the command people here and there's
*17:02.780- 17:08.140* :  lots of them. Absolute consensus that we're getting these these men out alive. No one's going to
*17:08.140- 17:13.200* :  get hurt and that we be careful. Given all the problems that you've been having, have you any idea
*17:13.200- 17:19.180* :  now about the timescale of the rescue? I'm absolutely positive and from the moment I arrived here
*17:19.340- 17:26.560* :  I'm a glass half full kind of guy. So here comes my assessment. 30 years of rescues and disaster
*17:26.560- 17:32.100* :  investigations and everything and I'm saying these men were dancing to Diwali when they went in
*17:32.460- 17:38.000* :  and I promise they'll be home singing Christmas carols. I'm just not quite sure where between
*17:38.000- 17:42.960* :  now and Christmas they're coming out. I think that would be a modern miracle actually. Like this
*17:42.960- 17:49.780* :  is a story I want to tell that I'm an old or older man. Professor Arnold Dicks. Now venture capital
*17:49.780- 17:55.900* :  has historically been a male dominated industry. Men make up the vast majority of venture capital
*17:55.900- 18:01.860* :  companies and get the most funding and yet research from Silicon Valley has shown that startup
*18:01.860- 18:08.540* :  firms led by women tend to outperform their male counterparts. Nora Bevy is the co-founder of
*18:08.540- 18:14.540* :  unconventional venture. A Nordic venture capital firm which invests in early stage companies and
*18:14.540- 18:21.100* :  has a focus on diversity. She told Vivian Nunes about her latest report on how and where venture
*18:21.100- 18:27.880* :  capital money is being spent. Year after year we keep seeing the same numbers meaning there are
*18:27.880- 18:34.320* :  barely any funding forwards to all female founding teams and I think what is new now or astonishing
*18:34.320- 18:41.200* :  across the Nordics plus Germany UK and France is that previous years we always heard excuse
*18:41.200- 18:47.000* :  of well women when they are in mixed teams they are getting funded but even that is being
*18:47.000- 18:52.120* :  being really diminished in terms of what the numbers is looking like. Because you looked at
*18:52.120- 19:01.460* :  France the Nordics the UK and Germany and in each of those it was less than 2% of venture capital
*19:01.460- 19:08.280* :  was going to all female teams and the situation for mixed teams was not that much better take us
*19:08.280- 19:14.180* :  through the numbers. This is our fifth report and what we've seen is that female founded companies
*19:14.180- 19:20.300* :  receive one third of the track size compared to all male founding teams. Now what is troubling
*19:20.300- 19:28.320* :  with this is that when we look at later stage that slams down to one sixth of the track size when
*19:28.320- 19:34.840* :  we compare to later stages. Now yet again proving that it is really systemic but when we look at
*19:34.840- 19:42.160* :  mixed teams what stood out is that the percentage of rounds versus the percentage of defending
*19:42.160- 19:48.880* :  were overall more balanced than it was when it were only looking at all female founding teams.
*19:49.520- 19:55.640* :  And what do you think is behind this disparity? Is it about the gender makeup of the venture capital
*19:55.640- 20:03.320* :  funds themselves? Are they less inclined to invest in a company run by women? Is it the
*20:03.320- 20:08.460* :  products and ideas that the women are bringing to the table and seeking funding for? What do you
*20:08.460- 20:13.860* :  think is behind it? What we see over and over again that actually female founded companies
*20:13.860- 20:20.700* :  overperform by 45% compared to male founded companies. So the business case is already there.
*20:20.980- 20:26.180* :  I truly believe that this is going back to looking at what it looks like for the last 10 years
*20:26.180- 20:31.920* :  even so is that the percentages aren't changing. We know that there was a correlation between who
*20:31.920- 20:36.720* :  writes the track and who receives the track. It's not about changing the founders is about changing
*20:36.720- 20:42.000* :  the decision makers because when we look at funds that exist in Europe as a whole we know that
*20:42.000- 20:49.140* :  6% of all venture funds are founded by female fund managers. But guess again they only
*20:49.140- 20:55.560* :  manage 1% of all asset under management. And we're not listening to the data today that it's
*20:55.560- 21:02.700* :  telling us over and over again that diverse founders whether that's from an ethnicity perspective
*21:02.700- 21:09.120* :  or gender lens or performing better. If we know that why aren't we funding them better?
*21:09.700- 21:13.260* :  And what do you think are the wider repercussions of this? I remember reading
*21:14.080- 21:19.760* :  a few months ago about startups involving women's health and contraceptive alternatives
*21:19.820- 21:26.620* :  and they were finding it incredibly difficult to win funding from VCs. Do you think there is a
*21:26.620- 21:30.600* :  flow on effect for what kind of products and businesses are being brought to market because of this
*21:30.600- 21:37.160* :  gender disparity in funding? Definitely and I think we are not seeing problems being solved for
*21:37.160- 21:43.640* :  the wider community meaning that male founded companies within FEMTEK are actually getting
*21:43.640- 21:52.260* :  more capital at higher valuations than women are within FEMTEK. When we talk about both environmental
*21:52.260- 21:58.520* :  and social aspects of the huge challenges we are facing with we now more than ever need more
*21:58.520- 22:04.180* :  perspectives behind the solutions so we can make sure that the products we're putting out there
*22:04.180- 22:12.660* :  are actually made benefiting the market as well as the end consumer. Nora Baby politicians often
*22:12.660- 22:17.980* :  make footballing analogies to make them sound cool but a Garnetian politician found himself
*22:17.980- 22:23.620* :  in a bit of hot water when he mocked Manchester United's Harry Maguire in Parliament last year.
*22:24.180- 22:30.020* :  He's now made a heartfelt apology. Isaac Fanning takes up the story. So last year you may have
*22:30.020- 22:35.800* :  seen a video doing the rounds on your social media it's from Isaac Adongo who is an MP in Garnet
*22:35.840- 22:42.480* :  and he mentioned at Harry Maguire who was struggling at the time for his form in the Premier League.
*23:00.360- 23:04.740* :  Isaac Adongo has now apologized to the Manchester United defender Harry Maguire for liking
*23:04.740- 23:12.860* :  him government fiscal mismanagement to his performances on the field. I actually spoke to Mr
*23:12.860- 23:18.880* :  Adongo and I asked him what does Harry Maguire got to do with Garnet in economic mismanagement?
*23:19.960- 23:25.900* :  Garnet is a football nation and coinciding with the World Cup that was very little interest in
*23:25.900- 23:33.700* :  the budget. So I decided to find something around football to communicate it the fact that I was
*23:33.700- 23:39.220* :  dissatisfied with the performance of the head of the economic management team who happens to be Dr
*23:39.220- 23:43.960* :  Mahamudu Bahamian the vice president. And so in an attempt to do that there was a straight bullet
*23:43.960- 23:51.520* :  which hits Harry Maguire and when his form improved I felt that he deserved an apology.
*23:52.180- 23:58.080* :  He's responded to you and he's extended a welcome to old traffic. He's forgiven you have you seen
*23:58.080- 24:05.140* :  that and what's your response? When you've had somebody and you apologize you genuinely become
*24:05.140- 24:11.700* :  satisfied that the person accepts it and I think that that humility and that magnanimity already
*24:12.400- 24:20.120* :  has made my day because when the person you apologize to remains silent you probably are not
*24:20.120- 24:25.940* :  able to close the chapter on that and I thought that this brings closure but to be icing on the cake
*24:25.940- 24:32.660* :  if I'm unable I'm able to see him play other for England or for Manchester United at old traffic.
*24:33.160- 24:39.300* :  So Harry Maguire is forgiven Isaac Adongo though it doesn't sound like he's forgiven the Garnet
*24:39.300- 24:45.480* :  and vice president. Joan Arma Trading is one of Britain's most celebrated singer songwriters.
*24:45.480- 24:51.480* :  Her many hits include love and affection and drop the pilot. In a career spanning over 50 years
*24:51.480- 24:56.960* :  she's written and recorded 20 studio albums and is a three-time Grammy award nominee.
*24:57.620- 25:00.760* :  Now she's written her first symphony. Its world premiere,
*25:00.760- 25:05.120* :  preferred by the Chinneke Orchestra made up of majority black and ethnic musicians,
*25:05.120- 25:11.420* :  is on Friday evening in London. Joan Arma Trading has been speaking to our arts reporter Sophie van
*25:17.820- 25:23.200* :  Brugen. This is Joan Arma Trading's first symphony in rehearsal. She wants to let the music speak
*25:23.200- 25:29.100* :  for itself. All I'm looking for is an emotion. I just want you to feel this thing that I'm
*25:29.400- 25:34.620* :  hoping everybody when they hear it will feel. What was the thought process behind it?
*25:34.620- 25:38.720* :  Why did you think okay now is the time? There's no thought process.
*25:41.660- 25:49.980* :  It's just writing some music. I literally went into the studio and I just started to write the symphony.
*25:51.020- 25:55.860* :  Joan Arma Trading came to prominence in the early 1970s. Now it's been particularly difficult
*25:55.860- 26:00.360* :  over the years for ladies singers to make an impact here in Britain in the same way they do in America.
*26:01.020- 26:04.580* :  Thankfully though as well as being one of the most sensitive and expressive of all,
*26:13.580- 26:17.600* :  Joan has broken through. She's won multiple awards for her music but has remained
*26:17.600- 26:23.820* :  staunchly independent, producing and playing every instrument on her records. 44, measure 44.
*26:24.720- 26:28.960* :  Conduct to Andrew Graham's is rehearsing the Chinneke Orchestra in a hall in South London.
*26:31.020- 26:39.760* :  It's relentlessly positive. It's this long song of positivity and uplifting feelings. Do you
*26:39.760- 26:45.600* :  think it has the ability to live on? I do think it has the ability to live on. You know one of the
*26:45.600- 26:52.480* :  things about Joan's music is that it's very difficult to define. It is classical but it has all
*26:52.480- 26:57.500* :  these elements that are not necessarily classical. Joan Arma Trading says she's lucky that writing music
*26:57.500- 27:03.020* :  comes easily to her. I can hear all the arrangements. I can hear the structure, I can see the structure.
*27:03.540- 27:07.640* :  Of course even though you hear that you still have to work out how am I going to play what's the tune
*27:07.640- 27:13.920* :  going to be or whatever. How did you actually learn to score a classical symphony? Well I didn't write
*27:13.920- 27:20.220* :  down the notes but I played everything and there's loads of virtual instruments and you can play all
*27:20.220- 27:27.740* :  of the virtual instruments on a keyboard. French horns, trumpet, trombone, violin, violas, cello.
*27:28.060- 27:33.600* :  So I play all the things so you hear the symphony. To me it's just like writing a song. And when
*27:33.600- 27:38.320* :  you're in that creative process is there a setting that you need to be in? I just need to be on my own.
*27:47.320- 27:53.000* :  I don't know another way of being so if I was starting now this is how I'd be.
*28:01.760- 28:06.900* :  But she worries that young people now often have a narrower exposure to music than when she was
*28:07.020- 28:11.980* :  growing up. You would hear a classical piece followed by a Beatles piece, followed by a Frank
*28:11.980- 28:17.200* :  Sinagis, followed by a Burlives, followed by a Led Zeppelin. You'd be exposed to all of these
*28:17.200- 28:23.580* :  different genres. For me that was the beauty of radio then because you didn't have to major
*28:23.580- 28:29.660* :  in country music because that's what seems to happen these days. You major in that particular genre
*28:29.660- 28:35.720* :  and you never leave it and find something else. I think that's quite sad when that happens.
*28:41.560- 28:45.700* :  And at 72 years old, Joan Arbor Trading has no plans to slow down.
*28:46.520- 28:50.760* :  I'm just doing stuff. This isn't like I've done this and now I'm happy and I can die. No.
*28:51.320- 28:53.480* :  This is just another piece of writing.
*28:59.140- 29:01.560* :  Joan Arbor Trading and the Chinneke Orchestra.
*29:04.880- 29:09.500* :  And that's all from us for now but it will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:10.080- 29:14.000* :  Before we go, a word on this week's happy pod from its presenter Harry Bly.
*29:14.880- 29:19.460* :  This week we've a heartwarming story about a lifelong regret that's finally been
*29:19.460- 29:25.700* :  addressed. 77-year-old Mike Phillips from Texas should have graduated from high school in 1965
*29:25.980- 29:32.340* :  but didn't because he joined the Navy and served in Vietnam. Now 60 years on he's finally been
*29:32.340- 29:37.960* :  awarded his high school diploma. We'll also hear about a comic book that started in India
*29:38.460- 29:42.620* :  that's now helping to educate girls all over the world about periods and menstruation.
*29:43.420- 29:48.960* :  And a cat that likes to spend its time as an English train station that's vying for a Christmas
*29:48.960- 29:54.740* :  number one. All that and more in the happy pod, a weekly compilation of uplifting news stories.
