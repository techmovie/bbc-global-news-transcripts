*00:20.460- 00:25.440* :  Our billionaire this episode is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*00:25.720- 00:32.500* :  At its peak, WeWork was worth $47 billion. And Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*00:32.580- 00:37.620* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila and made people do shots during business meetings.
*00:37.840- 00:42.640* :  His modest aspirations, including wanting to live forever, to become the world's first trillionaire
*00:42.640- 00:48.360* :  and expand his company to Mars. What we learned in the last couple of weeks is in reality, he oversaw
*00:48.360- 00:53.600* :  one of the most spectacular business failures in modern history. So is he good, bad, or just another
*00:53.600- 00:57.820* :  billionaire? To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*01:03.300- 01:07.500* :  It's exhilarating. It's like driving a car under an avalanche,
*01:07.700- 01:11.160* :  but you're taunting the avalanche rather than trying to get away from it.

*01:18.900- 01:22.520* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.560- 01:31.620* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday 7th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:31.660- 01:36.900* :  Israel's Prime Minister says his country will take over security responsibility for Gaza
*01:37.300- 01:42.540* :  for an indefinite period. As the peace dialogue in Ethiopia fault has, there's been another
*01:42.540- 01:48.420* :  outbreak of fighting in the Amhar region. And Charles III delivers the first King's speech
*01:48.420- 01:56.460* :  to parliament in more than seven decades. Also in this podcast, love letters to French sailors
*01:56.460- 02:02.240* :  during the seven years war made public now after being forgotten for more than two and a half
*02:02.240- 02:08.820* :  centuries. The British naval administration set these letters aside on the assumption that
*02:08.820- 02:14.100* :  they would forward them to the prisoner crew. And then either through lack of time or incompetence,
*02:14.140- 02:20.800* :  they were forgotten. And how an Argentine penguin colony is astonishingly thriving thanks to the
*02:20.800- 02:29.260* :  efforts of conservationists. But first, it's exactly one month since fighters from Hamas,
*02:29.300- 02:35.460* :  which controls Gaza, launched a series of surprise attacks on Israel, killing over 1400 people
*02:35.800- 02:41.280* :  and kidnapping more than 200. The Israeli military response has been massive and sustained
*02:41.280- 02:47.180* :  a ground operation in Gaza and almost daily air strikes. Israel says it's targeting Hamas
*02:47.180- 02:52.660* :  infrastructure in the Palestinian enclave. But the number of civilian deaths is rising more than
*02:52.660- 02:58.840* :  10,000, according to the Hamas run health ministry, many of them children. The Israeli Prime Minister
*02:58.840- 03:05.120* :  Benjamin Netanyahu remains to find. In an interview with the American Network ABC, he said there
*03:05.120- 03:10.500* :  would be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages. And he gave an indication about
*03:10.500- 03:17.620* :  what might happen after the fighting ends. I think Israel will for an indefinite period will have
*03:18.040- 03:23.500* :  the overall security responsibility because we've seen what happens when we don't have it.
*03:23.820- 03:27.780* :  When we don't have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of
*03:28.220- 03:33.140* :  Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine. I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*03:33.140- 03:39.360* :  Yoland, now, why Mr. Netanyahu was saying this now? I mean, he was talking to the American
*03:39.360- 03:44.560* :  network ABC. He's still rejected a ceasefire despite all the international calls for that.
*03:44.560- 03:49.240* :  But did say that Israel would consider tactical little pauses in fighting to allow aid to enter
*03:49.240- 03:55.120* :  in or hostages to exit. This is very much what Washington has been speaking about. But then there
*03:55.340- 04:01.200* :  has been this question raised. We know it's been a certain point of US diplomacy as Anthony Blinken
*04:01.200- 04:06.340* :  was just here traveling around the region. And the question about what will happen when this war
*04:06.340- 04:10.640* :  is over. I mean, there's been speculation. Could there be a role for the UN or for Israel's foreign
*04:10.640- 04:15.980* :  allies for the Palestinian Authority, which of course is a political rival to Hamas, it governs
*04:16.360- 04:20.920* :  parts of the occupied West Bank. And when I've spoken to officials from there, they've said they
*04:20.920- 04:26.380* :  couldn't go back to Gaza on the back of an Israeli tank. What the Israeli Prime Minister seems to be
*04:26.380- 04:30.940* :  talking about here is as a new Israeli occupation, saying it will have overall security
*04:31.840- 04:35.980* :  responsibility. Of course, the great likelihood is that there would be huge Palestinian resistance
*04:35.980- 04:41.420* :  to that. Can you give us the latest on the Israeli operations in Gaza? We've had one of these
*04:41.420- 04:47.100* :  sort of regular updates from the Israeli military where they said that they took hold of a Hamas stronghold
*04:47.100- 04:51.820* :  in the northern Gaza strip of actually put out aerial videos, which they say show that. They say
*04:51.820- 04:56.920* :  that they located anti-tank missiles there, launches other weapons and intelligence. They've
*04:56.920- 05:03.300* :  talked about Hamas fighters in Gaza City using a building close to a Kud's hospital where we know
*05:03.300- 05:06.780* :  there are lots of people sheltering. They're saying that was the place that they were trying to
*05:06.780- 05:10.820* :  launch attacks from and that there was a strike on there. But what we're also hearing, what I'm
*05:10.820- 05:15.580* :  not able to get any comment from about from the Israeli military, is big strikes in Hen Yunus and
*05:15.580- 05:20.720* :  Rafa in the very south of the Gaza strip with local health officials talking about at least 23
*05:20.720- 05:25.220* :  people killed in these separate air strikes and there's very dramatic footage that shows once
*05:25.220- 05:30.620* :  again children's bodies being pulled from the rubble, children being pulled alive as well,
*05:30.620- 05:35.960* :  but really quite devastating strikes on what appear to be family homes. Yeah, I'm looking at pictures
*05:36.180- 05:42.000* :  of Gaza at the moment and huge blooms of smoke right across this guideline. A minute silence
*05:42.000- 05:47.380* :  observed in Israel. Tell us about that. Yeah, so it's sort of an unofficial day of morning,
*05:47.380- 05:54.520* :  it's one month on now from those attacks, the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history.
*05:54.520- 05:59.960* :  We've seen people dressed in black. It was a call from the families of the people who
*05:59.960- 06:05.760* :  were killed that day for others to come out and just to remember with just one minute of silence
*06:05.760- 06:10.420* :  what happened. There are memorial services taking place at some schools and at universities,
*06:11.120- 06:16.420* :  many flags flying at half mast and more events planned through the day, including actually a
*06:16.420- 06:21.380* :  protest outside the Israeli parliament. There are also calls coming up from the families of those
*06:21.380- 06:26.400* :  240 hostages who remain inside Gaza for more to be done to bring their loved ones home.
*06:27.120- 06:33.460* :  Yeah, land now in Jerusalem. As we mentioned earlier, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*06:33.460- 06:39.060* :  has said that Israel will attune overall security responsibility for the territory once the war is
*06:39.100- 06:44.440* :  over, but what will that mean in practice? Our chief international editor Jeremy Bowen has this
*06:44.440- 06:50.740* :  assessment. Overall security responsibility is a phrase that's used in part of the West Bank,
*06:50.760- 06:58.160* :  which is the other area of the Palestinian territories. And in that, under the Oslo agreements back
*06:58.160- 07:04.260* :  in the 1990s, so we're talking almost of a historical document here, but there was one of those areas
*07:04.260- 07:10.640* :  was Palestinian municipal control and Israeli security responsibility. So in other words,
*07:11.200- 07:18.600* :  they would come and go as they pleased in terms of arresting and forcing shooting, but the more mundane
*07:18.600- 07:24.260* :  work-a-day things would, you know, collecting rubbish, running the schools, that sort of stuff,
*07:24.260- 07:30.760* :  would be done by Palestinians. But to do that, of course, you need a Palestinian body that is prepared
*07:30.760- 07:36.380* :  to work with the Israelis. And of course, after everything that's happened, I think the chances are
*07:36.380- 07:45.520* :  that any Palestinian who tries to do that would be regarded as a quizzling. So I do think that while
*07:45.520- 07:51.600* :  that might be a sort of vague aspiration for Israel, the fact is they are, you know, they are
*07:51.600- 07:58.640* :  going to be in a very difficult position because of the fact that they are stuck now, if you like,
*07:58.640- 08:03.460* :  with Gaza. They're going to have to deal with it. And I think it will involve an occupation. It's
*08:03.460- 08:10.300* :  going to have to. Jeremy Bowen, for the civilian population in Gaza, the situation continues to
*08:10.300- 08:15.760* :  deteriorate. Humanitarian aid is only trickling into Gaza, and shortages are becoming acute.
*08:16.160- 08:20.360* :  Juliet Tuma is from the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRA.
*08:21.020- 08:28.240* :  Our UNRA shelters are really overflowing with people. They're holding four times more of the
*08:28.240- 08:35.680* :  capacity that they were planned to do. We are at a situation where, in some places, 50 women
*08:35.680- 08:43.140* :  and girls are sharing one classroom and men and boys are forced to sleep outside in the open
*08:43.180- 08:48.860* :  in the school yard, sleeping sometimes on the floor because we are so ran out of matrices.
*08:49.740- 08:55.860* :  And the number of casualties in Gaza is rising alarmingly. The World Health Organization says more
*08:55.860- 09:01.840* :  than 160 children are being killed in the territory every day. It's criticized attacks on health
*09:01.840- 09:07.960* :  care facilities, but Israel insists such strikes are legitimate accusing Hamas of using hospitals
*09:07.960- 09:13.640* :  and ambulances to mount attacks. Fergil Keen has more on the plight of children in Gaza.
*09:14.480- 09:18.620* :  They cannot choose what they witness, the deaths of others,
*09:21.680- 09:22.640* :  and the grief of their elders.
*09:24.900- 09:30.840* :  Thousands have died. Farah Hassan was two and a half years old and was killed by an
*09:30.840- 09:37.640* :  airstrike on October 27th. She came late in the life of her parents, Abir and Muhammad.
*09:39.520- 09:41.680* :  Reaching now for the comfort of memory.
*09:45.660- 09:51.860* :  I felt as if I held the entire world in my hands, eagerly anticipating her arrival,
*09:52.420- 09:58.660* :  cherishing every moment until she took her first breath. I nurtured her with utmost care as she grew.
*09:59.320- 10:06.100* :  The first time I heard her voice, I couldn't believe it. She breathed life into my world. She filled my
*10:06.100- 10:13.160* :  whole world. For four weeks now our journalists in Gaza have recorded the impact of the war on
*10:13.160- 10:22.680* :  its children. Those who survive live with the trauma. But there is another story that speaks of
*10:22.680- 10:28.840* :  Gaza's children and a longing for Joel. Twelve years ago they created a world record for
*10:28.840- 10:41.360* :  kite flying, a transcendent moment. And even now amid all the war has taken, there is also resilience.
*10:45.160- 10:52.180* :  Children making worlds of their own within the war. 12-year-old Leanne Halaf finds comfort in her
*10:52.180- 10:59.240* :  family when the bombing starts. My mom calls my brothers and sisters to hug them, she says,
*10:59.920- 11:08.400* :  and we hold each other's hands. In the grounds of our acts of hospital, staff and the children
*11:08.400- 11:19.940* :  of refugees, surgical gloves make little balloons. In another part of the hospital,
*11:20.720- 11:26.680* :  more of Gaza's children were being mourned. Little Mariam Al-Masri.
*11:30.540- 11:36.000* :  How will I go home without you, my beloved? How will I go back without you, my darling?
*11:39.900- 11:47.080* :  Furgle Keen with that report. Other stories now, the G7 support for Ukraine isn't going anywhere.
*11:47.320- 11:51.860* :  That's the firm advice from Japan, as foreign ministers from the wealthy nations block,
*11:51.860- 11:59.100* :  plus the EU meets in Tokyo. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, the G7 has issued just one
*11:59.100- 12:04.380* :  statement on the ongoing war after Russia's invasion. Speaking to journalists in Tokyo,
*12:04.380- 12:09.900* :  Britain's foreign secretary, James Cleveley, insisted the block wanted to see humanitarian pauses
*12:09.900- 12:16.380* :  in Gaza, though he insisted the G7 has seen nothing from Hamas to say they're serious about a
*12:16.380- 12:22.140* :  ceasefire. Group of anti-war protesters gathered in Tokyo near the venue, waving Palestinian flags
*12:22.140- 12:30.720* :  and flanked by police. This woman explained why she was there. We get so much tragic news every day,
*12:30.720- 12:36.540* :  more than anything else. I decided to come today not because I don't or do understand the political
*12:36.540- 12:41.540* :  situation or anything about the Middle East, but because I thought if there's a place where I can
*12:41.540- 12:47.640* :  disagree as a human being, then I should attend. I got the latest from our Tokyo correspondent,
*12:47.640- 12:52.720* :  Shima Khalil, asked her what the Japanese and British diplomats had been saying.
*12:53.320- 12:57.460* :  I think the focus is on really three main points. The security in the Indo-Pacific,
*12:57.500- 13:03.820* :  the four ministers, the foreign secretary, the defense secretary of the UK, but also their
*13:03.820- 13:10.420* :  Japanese counterparts have essentially been in unison in saying that the partnership between the
*13:10.420- 13:16.640* :  two countries is really, really strong-ass grandchaps. The British defense secretary, whether the wars,
*13:16.640- 13:23.160* :  whether it's the Ukraine war or the Middle East war, could distract Britain and Japan's allies
*13:23.160- 13:26.880* :  from security in the Indo-Pacific. And he said absolutely not the fact that we're here
*13:27.540- 13:32.260* :  is proof of that. But I think on the war in Ukraine, again, there's been concern that it's almost
*13:32.260- 13:37.020* :  been as it's going on. It hasn't been given the attention. And I think again, the four ministers
*13:37.020- 13:42.220* :  were saying that despite all that's going on, they continue to support Ukraine's right to defend
*13:42.220- 13:49.300* :  itself. And they say that they will continue to pose sanctions on Russia as well as being in contact
*13:49.300- 13:53.460* :  with the Ukrainian foreign minister during the sessions of the G7 foreign ministers meeting.
*13:53.460- 13:58.720* :  Is there anything they can actually do? They will continue sanctions on Russia. What's interesting
*13:58.720- 14:03.440* :  is that the defense secretary was asked about Russian diamonds. If you remember back in May,
*14:03.440- 14:09.140* :  during the G7 leadership summit, there was an announcement about sanctions on Russian
*14:09.140- 14:14.620* :  diamonds, the diamond trade, and that it was going to come into place at the end of the year.
*14:14.620- 14:19.000* :  We haven't heard any more details about that. And from what we've heard today, I don't think
*14:19.000- 14:24.240* :  we'll get an announcement on that. I think what they want to say, again, as I united front,
*14:24.240- 14:28.620* :  is that they haven't forgotten about their commitment towards Ukraine. They haven't
*14:28.620- 14:33.260* :  forgotten about Russia, despite most of the attention now being on the Middle East.
*14:36.800- 14:42.580* :  Charles III has delivered his first King's speech to Parliament in London, marking the start of
*14:42.580- 14:54.320* :  the parliamentary year amid pomp and pageantry. It's the first such speech since the death of Queen
*14:54.360- 14:59.480* :  Elizabeth last year, and the King began the formal ceremony with a personal tribute.
*14:59.800- 15:06.640* :  It is mindful of a legacy of service and devotion to this country set by my beloved mother,
*15:06.920- 15:12.560* :  the late Queen, that I deliver this the first King's speech in over 70 years.
*15:13.300- 15:17.580* :  Our political correspondent Rob Watson was there and told me about the atmosphere.
*15:18.120- 15:22.360* :  Do you know you're struck by two things, Alex, and I was lucky enough to have a real kind of close
*15:22.360- 15:26.920* :  up seat. I could have almost got the king at a cup of tea and the queen of coffee.
*15:27.340- 15:31.460* :  So you're sort of struck by the realization that the page of history really has turned,
*15:31.460- 15:37.060* :  and this country, Queen Elizabeth, is no longer here after a such a long reign. But you're also sort
*15:37.060- 15:42.840* :  of struck by the amazing continuity, of course, of the monarchy, as now represented by King Charles.
*15:42.860- 15:46.460* :  So that, if you like, is the sort of social history bit. I mean, the other bit that I was struck
*15:46.460- 15:52.320* :  by is that politics also rumbles on Alex. And in this case, you have a government hoping
*15:52.320- 15:57.120* :  that after 13 years in office, the speech that was read out by the King on the government's
*15:57.120- 16:02.580* :  behalf still has sort of something to offer to the British voters before an election sometime
*16:02.580- 16:06.160* :  in the next year or so. What are the main takeaways, though, from what he said?
*16:06.360- 16:10.200* :  So I think, look, the main takeaway from the speech is that this is a government that is,
*16:10.620- 16:14.340* :  as you would expect, it's a conservative government. It's sort of making an appeal to voters
*16:14.340- 16:18.360* :  on the right by saying, you know, we're going to be tougher on crime. We'd be the ones who are
*16:18.360- 16:22.320* :  going to be tough on immigration. But of course, the problem that the government faces is
*16:22.320- 16:26.680* :  that 13 years, I just mentioned. I mean, the sort of natural human instinct is to say, well,
*16:27.040- 16:31.360* :  hang on a minute, if you have any good ideas, you've been in power for 13 years. Why on earth
*16:31.360- 16:36.460* :  haven't you done them? So I suspect that even the government doesn't really think that a sort
*16:36.460- 16:40.500* :  of speech, which was very much a sort of study as she goes rather than a radical program would
*16:40.500- 16:45.040* :  make much difference. And it seems to me, Alex, the government is so far behind in the opinion
*16:45.040- 16:49.200* :  polling that really the only thing that would save them at this point is, you know, some
*16:49.200- 16:54.660* :  unforecast upturn in the UK economy, or maybe the main opposition labor party,
*16:55.080- 16:59.720* :  imploding over some other issue or another. But the government knows it's really up against it.
*16:59.720- 17:05.000* :  It's those 13 years. It was quite interesting watching the king's face, particularly as he
*17:05.000- 17:09.780* :  detailed the government's environmental policies. Yes, I'm sure there'll be all sorts of people in
*17:09.780- 17:14.720* :  this country and beyond thinking, well, we all know that King Charles is an early advocate of
*17:15.080- 17:19.880* :  early war against climate change, dangerous to biodiversity. So you were thinking that when he
*17:19.880- 17:24.380* :  read out of the government saying that it was going to be, you know, more open-minded about the
*17:24.380- 17:29.500* :  idea of more gas and oil exploration in the North Sea off the UK coast, that maybe that wouldn't
*17:29.500- 17:34.060* :  be as cup of tea. But again, you know, it's a reminder of the whole constitutional monarchy thing,
*17:34.060- 17:38.760* :  right, Alex, that no matter what the king or the queen before him thinks about the government's
*17:38.760- 17:43.620* :  policies, my goodness, they keep a straight face. Our political correspondent Rob Watson
*17:46.000- 17:53.420* :  still to come in this podcast how the reluctance of Chinese tourists to visit hurts the Thai economy.
*18:01.760- 18:05.880* :  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
*18:06.000- 18:10.960* :  Our billionaire this episode is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*18:11.360- 18:18.300* :  Adam's peak WeWork was worth $47 billion and Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point. He
*18:18.300- 18:24.520* :  spent $20,000 on tequila and made people do shots during business meetings. His modest aspirations
*18:24.520- 18:29.260* :  including wanting to live forever to become the world's first trillionaire and expand his company
*18:29.260- 18:34.480* :  to Mars. What we learned in the last couple of weeks is in reality, he oversaw one of the most
*18:34.480- 18:39.620* :  spectacular business failures in modern history. So is he good, bad, or just another billionaire?
*18:39.920- 18:43.340* :  To find out, listen to good, bad billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:49.500- 18:54.460* :  Suddenly my quilt is ripped off me and my room is full of white men and I thought I'm done for.
*18:54.640- 18:56.380* :  These are fascists, they found where I live.
*18:56.580- 19:01.660* :  Life's less ordinary is the podcast from the BBC World Service bringing you extraordinary
*19:01.660- 19:07.260* :  personal stories from around the globe. Betrayal, it runs through my life and runs through my story.
*19:07.400- 19:12.700* :  I was just all alone in this vast broken system. I never gave up my dream.
*19:13.000- 19:16.740* :  Search for lifeless ordinary wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*19:19.520- 19:25.160* :  To East Africa now, despite calls from the international community for greater dialogue in
*19:25.160- 19:30.400* :  Ethiopia, there has been another outbreak of fighting in the Amhara region with troops from
*19:30.400- 19:35.320* :  the Ethiopian government, clashing once again with militias that they've been battling in the
*19:35.320- 19:40.720* :  region since August. To find out more, Davina Gupta spoke to our reporter, Calcutta and Yibaltal,
*19:41.040- 19:46.200* :  in Addis Habibah. It seems that the violence has not stopped. We've been seeing this
*19:46.540- 19:53.100* :  sporadic clashes in pocket areas, but now it seems that there is a major oppression underway.
*19:53.100- 19:59.700* :  What the militias claiming is that the government is launching this offensive, trying to regain
*19:59.700- 20:05.560* :  full control of the region. The most intense fighting was reported, as you said, in August.
*20:05.620- 20:11.660* :  At that time, the militias managed to enter most of the region's main cities. They even briefly
*20:11.660- 20:17.600* :  controlled an airport. After that, the government launched this offensive and pushed them out of
*20:17.600- 20:23.380* :  these cities, but they have continued to operate in rural areas and smaller towns, and they have
*20:23.760- 20:29.340* :  claimed controlling some of the region's smaller towns and then rural villages. So now it seems
*20:29.340- 20:34.360* :  there is an effort to try to push them out from there as well. But we haven't had any
*20:34.360- 20:38.680* :  statement from the government, so we don't know what is going on from their side. The militias
*20:38.680- 20:42.280* :  are saying that there is an attack against them and they are twerking that attack.
*20:42.840- 20:48.740* :  What's the impact of this on the internal security also of Ethiopia, which recently saw an end
*20:48.740- 20:54.860* :  to a civil war in the Tigray region and is trying to rebuild? It has quite a significant impact
*20:54.860- 21:00.960* :  for the country's security, for the country's economy as well. As you said, the brutal civil war
*21:00.960- 21:07.860* :  integrated a year ago, and that region is still reeling from the impacts of the war. We haven't
*21:07.860- 21:14.960* :  had much construction and rebuilding because there are other ongoing conflicts like this one.
*21:15.340- 21:19.660* :  And now in this region in Amhara, which is the second largest in Ethiopia, which is home to
*21:19.660- 21:26.100* :  more than 25 million people, we are witnessing this insecurity and it's sure going to have
*21:26.320- 21:31.240* :  a tremendous impact on the country. What can be then a possible solution at this stage?
*21:32.000- 21:36.160* :  Well, there have been calls from quite a number of Western states, including the US and the UK
*21:36.580- 21:41.940* :  in recent weeks, calling for dialogue or trying to resolve the issues through discussions
*21:41.940- 21:46.960* :  with these militias. But that doesn't seem to be on the horizon right now. For one thing,
*21:46.960- 21:52.280* :  these militias are not an organized armoured group under one command. There seems to be
*21:52.280- 21:58.020* :  preting under different smaller and fragmented groups. And the government is saying that they're
*21:58.460- 22:03.320* :  basically outlaws. So we're not seeing signs of trying to resolve these issues through dialogue.
*22:04.160- 22:07.420* :  The BBC's Calcutta and Ybilthal in Addis Ababa.
*22:08.400- 22:14.140* :  Few large countries are as dependent on tourism as Thailand. The Thai economy was hit very
*22:14.140- 22:19.780* :  hard by the COVID restrictions and Thai's hat hope that 2023 would be the year that saw their
*22:19.780- 22:24.640* :  tourist economy bounce back. That though has not happened, largely because the Chinese,
*22:24.640- 22:30.980* :  who make up one quarter of the 40 million foreign visitors who arrived in Thailand in 2019,
*22:30.980- 22:36.680* :  have not come back, at least not in the same numbers. Our Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan
*22:36.680- 22:38.720* :  Head has been finding out why.
*22:44.940- 22:48.300* :  76 Garage is a Bangkok restaurant with a difference.
*22:50.420- 22:53.940* :  Around eight in the evening, the waiters, all fit young men,
*22:53.940- 22:59.220* :  stripped down to their shorts and weighed into a pool, offering to carry the customers,
*22:59.220- 23:03.760* :  nearly all of them Chinese tourists, in their arms to have their photos taken.
*23:04.540- 23:07.560* :  There was a time when you had to book a month in advance to eat here,
*23:08.340- 23:10.540* :  but these days half the tables are empty.
*23:14.120- 23:16.040* :  Abby, her Chinese student in Thailand,
*23:16.040- 23:21.280* :  vlogs about places like 76 Garage to her thousands of social media followers.
*23:22.160- 23:26.280* :  Recently, she spotted alarming rumours circulating on her feed.
*23:31.240- 23:34.140* :  So, the restaurant is actually a front,
*23:34.140- 23:38.680* :  luring unsuspecting Chinese diners into having their kidneys removed.
*23:40.660- 23:46.000* :  Some of the feed used to be very positive. Many said they really wanted to come to Thailand,
*23:46.800- 23:51.200* :  but after this rumours started spreading, the comments changed completely.
*23:52.300- 23:55.920* :  People would ask me, are you only the kidney harvesting scam?
*23:56.380- 23:59.160* :  Are you sending people from Thailand to Myanmar?
*24:00.280- 24:05.040* :  These wild rumours have been fueled by the very real problem of scam centres,
*24:05.620- 24:07.100* :  operating along Thailand's borders.
*24:12.380- 24:16.700* :  This film, no more bets, which dramatizes the fate of Chinese citizens,
*24:16.760- 24:20.960* :  trapped in these scam centres, was a huge hit in China over the summer.
*24:21.940- 24:26.320* :  Freewheeling, fun-loving Thailand, suddenly started to look unsafe.
*24:29.080- 24:33.780* :  The Thai government has responded to these scares by waving visas for Chinese nationals.
*24:35.260- 24:38.940* :  It organised this welcome ceremony for new arrivals at the airport,
*24:39.440- 24:43.540* :  hosted by the new Prime Minister. But then, another setback.
*24:47.140- 24:52.500* :  Last month, the 14-year-old boy opened fire inside Bangkok's most famous shopping mall,
*24:53.040- 24:57.420* :  killing three people, among them a mother of two visiting from China.
*24:58.340- 25:02.880* :  These headwinds are holding back a much-needed recovery in Thailand's tourism.
*25:05.180- 25:10.240* :  This frustrated guide at the Grand Palace in Bangkok says his government must have been
*25:10.240- 25:14.280* :  dreaming when it promised that tourism would be back to normal this year.
*25:15.340- 25:17.820* :  Gary Bauman, whose company Check in Asia,
*25:17.820- 25:22.500* :  tracks the travel industry in the region, says it's not just because of safety fears.
*25:23.000- 25:26.720* :  I think there are a number of reasons, but I think the primary one is going back to January.
*25:27.200- 25:30.760* :  You know, when China did reopen, it's done in a very phased way.
*25:30.760- 25:34.240* :  The government has controlled the reopening, particularly for the group tour market,
*25:34.240- 25:37.280* :  which is quite important to Thailand that's been slowed right down.
*25:37.640- 25:40.760* :  And those who are still travelling to Thailand are changing.
*25:41.420- 25:45.920* :  Gone are the days when the Chinese came mostly in large, noisy groups.
*25:46.400- 25:50.760* :  We are pushing for more quality. We don't want just numbers.
*25:51.060- 25:56.700* :  Tiro Anteja Ubon, whose family company Kasemkit, operates a chain of luxury hotels and service
*25:56.700- 26:01.660* :  departments, says she's starting to see a wealthier kind of Chinese traveller.
*26:01.820- 26:08.140* :  They are more open to more experience. They spend a lot on food, on activities.
*26:08.220- 26:14.260* :  Like in Samui, we have this hotel on our private island, 24 villas.
*26:14.580- 26:19.260* :  We have a lot of Chinese that buy out the whole island for birthday,
*26:19.260- 26:21.840* :  for weddings, and even for proposals.
*26:22.540- 26:27.600* :  There are now so many other niches in the huge and fast-changing Chinese market
*26:27.600- 26:32.920* :  that Thailand will have to attract to sustain its all-important tourist industry.
*26:34.080- 26:35.780* :  Jonathan Head in Bangkok
*26:37.480- 26:43.400* :  wartime letters written to French sailors in the 18th century and confiscated by the Royal Navy
*26:43.760- 26:47.960* :  have been opened for the first time. The letters bound with a ribbon have been
*26:47.960- 26:51.340* :  gathering dust in a storage unit as Justine Green reports.
*26:52.140- 26:57.280* :  The letters written in 1757 and 1758 were intended for the crew of the French
*26:57.280- 27:01.720* :  warship The Galatine. Wives, fiancés, parents, and siblings sent the
*27:01.720- 27:04.400* :  missives to their loved ones, but they never reached them.
*27:04.780- 27:08.600* :  The ship was captured by the British and the letters ended up in storage.
*27:09.460- 27:14.240* :  A Cambridge University academic, Professor Rhino Moyer, unearthed the collection of 104
*27:14.240- 27:19.640* :  letters from the National Archives at Q. He believes officials opened two of them to see if they
*27:19.640- 27:24.840* :  had any military value, but decided they just contained family stuff and put them away.
*27:28.260- 27:33.300* :  The British naval administration, the Admiralty, set these letters aside on the assumption
*27:33.300- 27:38.000* :  that they would forward them to the prisoner crew. And then either through lack of time or
*27:38.000- 27:43.160* :  incompetence or simply because they couldn't find these prisoners who were dispatched to various
*27:43.160- 27:49.020* :  English prisons, they were forgotten, and there they remained for over 250 years.
*27:49.260- 27:52.660* :  The notes make for fascinating reading. With one wife writing,
*27:52.700- 27:57.560* :  I could spend the night writing to you, and another I cannot wait to possess you.
*27:58.040- 28:01.720* :  Professor Moria says they're not unique to France or the 18th century,
*28:01.720- 28:05.500* :  and reveal how we all cope when separated from loved ones.
*28:06.100- 28:13.100* :  Just in green. And finally, to a success story in the world of penguins.
*28:19.660- 28:24.720* :  In the last decade and a half, the 12 penguins who lived at the L-pedal colony
*28:24.720- 28:30.860* :  in Argentina have grown to 8,000. Thanks to the work of conservationists, among them
*28:30.860- 28:37.300* :  is Dr. Pablo Borraglu. He's been teaching others how to do this at a biodiversity summit in London,
*28:38.000- 28:40.360* :  and also spoke to my colleague, Michelle Hussein.
*28:41.000- 28:46.000* :  So when we first discovered this colony 15 years ago, there were six pairs of nets. They were
*28:46.000- 28:52.040* :  exploring, prospecting, looking for a safe and secure place to nest. But it was a mess,
*28:52.100- 28:56.520* :  because there were reckless people visiting the area. They were throwing garbage everywhere.
*28:56.520- 29:01.820* :  They would go with dogs. They were a threat for penguins. Also, they would make barbecues and
*29:01.820- 29:06.980* :  setting bushes on fire where the penguins were nesting. And of course, there was a lot of human
*29:06.980- 29:11.840* :  disturbance, because not everybody respect penguins as we think. So there was also a problem with
*29:11.840- 29:15.740* :  plastic pollution, you know, coming from the fisheries, but also from these reckless people.
*29:16.240- 29:23.420* :  So we started to protect the colony and restricting the access of these people. But it was not easy,
*29:23.420- 29:29.520* :  because we had a lot of incidents with army trespassers and vandalism. But then we knew that we
*29:29.520- 29:34.940* :  had to protect it. And then penguins responded, because the colony started to grow. And from those
*29:34.940- 29:41.740* :  six, the next season, we have 40 and 70 and 500. And then we implemented an ecotrism operation.
*29:41.820- 29:46.260* :  We had the land owners to do that, so that generated jobs and incomes for the local community.
*29:46.260- 29:50.960* :  So people perceived that a live penguin was much useful for them, you know.
*29:51.160- 29:55.760* :  So it sounds like the first thing was actually sealing off the area to making it a no-go area for
*29:55.760- 30:00.400* :  humans. Exactly, because the colony could have disappearing one afternoon, you know, with only six
*30:00.400- 30:06.460* :  pairs, if a dog would kill them all, that would be it. But we also needed penguins to feel safe
*30:06.460- 30:12.080* :  in that area. So we implemented a management plan. And then we took a lot of, we implemented a
*30:12.080- 30:16.940* :  lot of educational activities. We took kids to remove all the plastics from the beach and from the
*30:16.940- 30:22.120* :  nesting area, different activities in terms of education. So people perceive that they could be
*30:22.120- 30:26.580* :  part. And this is part of what we are sharing now at the Widley Fund from Nature Summit that we're
*30:26.580- 30:31.580* :  having this week. We're all coming here to share our stories. And at the beginning, you're so
*30:31.580- 30:38.440* :  right. Because you were facing, you know, these people coming with guns, cutting defenses to
*30:38.440- 30:44.060* :  trespass, trying to do what they've been doing forever. So we work with the government and with
*30:44.060- 30:50.840* :  the land owners to implement, to create a wildlife refuge. So with that kind of level of formal
*30:50.840- 30:56.400* :  protection, help us to, you know, stop these people from coming in. And now, as you said, we have
*30:56.400- 31:01.360* :  8,000 breeders. So the sound that we just heard is what you hear in the morning when penguins are
*31:01.360- 31:06.720* :  living to the ocean to get food and also in the afternoon. So penguins, they don't thank you,
*31:07.060- 31:11.440* :  but you feel that, you know, in the air, because when you are there, this is, it's a fantastic
*31:11.440- 31:17.600* :  moment. And it's one of the most amazing wildlife spectacles on the planet. That was the conservationist
*31:17.600- 31:26.120* :  Dr Pablo Borboriglu. And that's all from us for now. But there'll be a new edition of the Global
*31:26.120- 31:32.500* :  News Podcast later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send

*32:02.500- 32:06.600* :  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
*32:06.720- 32:11.700* :  Our billionaire this episode is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*32:11.820- 32:18.760* :  Adam's peak WeWork was worth $47 billion. And Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*32:18.840- 32:23.880* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila and made people do shots during business meetings.
*32:24.100- 32:28.260* :  His modest aspirations, including wanting to live forever, to become the world's first
*32:28.260- 32:33.420* :  trillionaire and expand his company to Mars. What we learned in the last couple of weeks is in
*32:33.420- 32:38.160* :  reality he oversaw one of the most spectacular business failures in modern history. So is he
*32:38.160- 32:43.340* :  good, bad, or just another billionaire? To find out, listen to good, bad billionaire wherever you
*32:43.340- 32:44.120* :  get your podcasts.
