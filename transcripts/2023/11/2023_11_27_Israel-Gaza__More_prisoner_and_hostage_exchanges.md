*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.960* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.640- 00:25.180* :  I'm Alex Richardson and in the early hours of Monday, the 27th of November, these are our main
*00:25.180- 00:31.000* :  stories. Joe Biden welcomes the release of another 17 people kidnapped and held in Gaza,
*00:31.560- 00:35.620* :  including a four-year-old girl orphaned in the Hamas attack on southern Israel.
*00:35.880- 00:42.560* :  The proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful
*00:42.560- 00:47.640* :  tear we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again.
*00:48.000- 00:53.400* :  In return, Israel frees 39 Palestinian prisoners on the third day of a pause in fighting
*00:53.400- 00:59.800* :  between Israel and Hamas. And Sierra Leone says most of the presumed leaders of a day of military
*00:59.800- 01:08.080* :  unrest in the capital have been arrested. Also in this podcast, an ethnic militia seizes control
*01:08.080- 01:13.740* :  of another border crossing in northern Myanmar. And it doesn't matter which player you speak to
*01:13.740- 01:18.700* :  that's play for Terry, all of them would speak incredibly highly of them. Not just as a coach,
*01:18.820- 01:25.840* :  but also as a human being and a lovely, lovely, fun man. We look back at the life of the former
*01:25.840- 01:29.980* :  England football manager Terry Venables who was died at the age of 80.
*01:34.280- 01:39.660* :  The past three days of the pause in fighting in Gaza has seen a mounting number of Israeli
*01:39.660- 01:45.700* :  and Thai hostages freed and Palestinian prisoners released. And after six weeks of war,
*01:45.700- 01:51.340* :  people in Gaza are receiving more supplies of desperately needed aid. So for Israelis and
*01:51.340- 01:57.000* :  Palestinians, their hopes have been raised. But the four day pause is due to end on Monday after
*01:57.000- 02:04.620* :  50 hostages are released and 150 prisoners freed. The agreement, broken by Qatar, could see Israel
*02:04.620- 02:09.940* :  and Hamas extend this for several more days. Something President Biden is pushing for.
*02:10.320- 02:15.880* :  This deal is delivering life-saving results. Critically, need today is going in and hostages
*02:15.880- 02:20.720* :  are coming out. And this deal is structured so that it can be extended. To keep building on these
*02:20.720- 02:25.800* :  results, that's our goal. To keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see
*02:25.800- 02:30.900* :  more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those who are needing Gaza.
*02:31.420- 02:37.220* :  But the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every
*02:37.220- 02:42.520* :  grateful cheer we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again.
*02:42.820- 02:49.380* :  The proof is a little Abigail. Abigail Edan is one of the first American hostages to be released.
*02:49.380- 02:55.140* :  She has Israeli dual citizenship and lost her parents when they were killed by Hamas on October
*02:55.140- 03:01.720* :  the 7th and turned four while she was in captivity. Abigail was freed along with 13 other Israelis
*03:01.720- 03:08.500* :  and three Thai nationals. And as part of the deal, 39 Palestinians held by Israel were also freed.
*03:08.940- 03:13.780* :  Meanwhile, the UN has said that 61 lorries with aid were delivered to northern Gaza,
*03:13.780- 03:19.120* :  which has seen the fiercest fighting. It's the largest number so far. But even in the south of
*03:19.120- 03:25.160* :  the Palestinian territory, people such as Ula Al-Kashash are still struggling to find enough to eat.
*03:25.740- 03:33.080* :  We are being humiliated. Everything was bombed. We have to stand in a queue for 10 hours sometimes
*03:33.080- 03:38.460* :  only to come back late at night with a small piece of bread. We can't afford anything.
*03:39.140- 03:42.540* :  The situation is very dire. There is nothing more to say.
*03:43.440- 03:48.460* :  The Hamas controlled health authority says that 15,000 people have been killed in Gaza,
*03:48.460- 03:54.460* :  a third of them children. The war started after Hamas massacred more than 1200 people in southern
*03:54.460- 04:01.100* :  Israel and abducted according to Israel around 240 others. Our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*04:01.100- 04:07.620* :  Lucy Williamson gave me an update on the latest group to be freed. Both the hostages freed by Hamas
*04:07.880- 04:14.240* :  and 39 Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jails. That exchange has taken place. They are
*04:14.240- 04:20.320* :  thought to all of those Palestinian prisoners be 18 years or under one of them. We think it's 14
*04:20.320- 04:25.480* :  years under House arrest. That House arrest has now been removed. It does seem as if day three of
*04:25.480- 04:30.980* :  this truth has gone a little bit more according to plan than yesterday when we saw those very long
*04:30.980- 04:37.300* :  delays, high anxiety around whether the agreement was breaking down. We heard from President Biden
*04:37.300- 04:43.180* :  he's keen to see the pause in the fighting extended. What are the chances of Israel agreeing to this?
*04:43.380- 04:48.380* :  I think this is where the attention is focused increasingly day by day as we get to the end of
*04:48.380- 04:53.380* :  this four day truth. The question of what happens on the day after is looming larger. Israel has
*04:53.400- 05:00.580* :  always said it's going to resume the war after this temporary ceasefire. But tonight we heard from
*05:00.580- 05:06.420* :  President Biden their calling for the ceasefire to be extended and in fact we've got news that Hamas
*05:06.420- 05:13.940* :  has also signaled to negotiators that it's ready to extend the truth by two to four days. I mean
*05:13.940- 05:19.000* :  that they say would mean potentially another 20 to 40 Israeli hostages being released if that
*05:19.000- 05:24.840* :  were agreed because the terms of the agreement outlined earlier where that Israel would offer
*05:24.840- 05:31.600* :  another day of truth for every 10 hostages released beyond this current deal. At the moment
*05:31.600- 05:37.740* :  so far from Israel we've heard more reiteration that it's going to resume the war once this
*05:37.740- 05:43.740* :  truth ends but of course we still do have more than 24 hours to run and the intervention of
*05:43.740- 05:49.220* :  President Biden is significant. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Gaza for the
*05:49.240- 05:53.900* :  first time since the start of the war today. Let's just listen to what he said to soldiers.
*05:55.260- 06:01.420* :  We are here in the Gaza Strip with our heroic fighters. We are making every effort to return our
*06:01.420- 06:07.120* :  hostages and at the end of the day we will return everyone. We have three goals in this war.
*06:07.120- 06:13.960* :  Eliminate Hamas, return of all our hostages and ensure that Gaza does not return to be a threat
*06:13.960- 06:20.740* :  to the state of Israeli gain. We are continuing until the end until victory. Nothing will stop us.
*06:21.040- 06:27.840* :  Lucy as you can hear Mr Netanyahu sounding defiant is there a danger for him if the pause goes
*06:27.840- 06:34.140* :  on that this could end up into a full ceasefire? I think he's always been very clear that that is
*06:34.140- 06:39.500* :  not what he wants. The 7th of October attacks changed something for Israel and that they're no longer
*06:39.900- 06:45.320* :  mowing the grass as they used to say. They're no longer doing just enough to keep what they perceive
*06:45.320- 06:51.840* :  as the threat under control. Now it's a different goal. He wants to destroy Hamas, destroy their
*06:51.840- 06:57.840* :  ability to threaten Israel militarily but also politically and he's put that front and center of
*06:57.840- 07:04.140* :  those three war aims that you heard there even when it comes to returning the hostages which has
*07:04.140- 07:10.640* :  become a more prominent part of those war aims over the last few weeks. That goal of destroying Hamas
*07:10.640- 07:15.540* :  has always been front and center and don't forget I mean Israel's politicians and its military
*07:15.540- 07:21.400* :  have a lot to prove after the intelligence failures and the security failures of the 7th of October.
*07:21.880- 07:32.040* :  Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem to West Africa now. Gunshots shattered the early morning
*07:32.040- 07:37.460* :  calm on the streets of Sierra Leone's capital free town as rebel soldiers attempted to break into
*07:37.460- 07:43.560* :  a military armory several jails were also attacked. Sparadic gunfire continued into the afternoon
*07:43.560- 07:48.760* :  though the authorities insist they've regained control of most of the city. This was the country's
*07:48.760- 07:55.300* :  information minister Chernobyl talking to the BBC on Sunday. We have declared a nationwide
*07:55.300- 08:01.420* :  coffee we're asking our residents or stay indoors especially because we're in the process of
*08:01.500- 08:06.400* :  trying to track down the retreats in renegades who are tempted to see legal activity.
*08:07.020- 08:12.860* :  The president Julius Mada Bio has said most of the presumed leaders of an attack on the barracks
*08:12.860- 08:18.280* :  in the capital free town have been arrested so has calm been restored. I heard more from our
*08:18.280- 08:24.580* :  correspondent in free town Umaru Fafana. I've just taken a long stroll down the main road
*08:24.580- 08:30.960* :  in my neighborhood and people are generally staying indoors. It's the longest hiatus of quiet
*08:30.960- 08:37.100* :  since dawn today. Are we any clear on precisely what happened today because the trouble was
*08:37.100- 08:41.120* :  almost everywhere wasn't it? It was almost everywhere in the capital city and its
*08:41.120- 08:45.920* :  outskirts and the provinces were told that it was all quite quiet in free town. It all started
*08:45.920- 08:50.500* :  at a military barracks called Wilberforce which is literally a walking distance from the president's
*08:50.500- 08:55.220* :  residence. Some soldiers broke into the armory. The shooting continued elsewhere by the same
*08:55.220- 08:59.980* :  attackers who were in various parts of the capital and then they went to the eastern outskirts and
*08:59.980- 09:05.520* :  there was heavy shooting in a place called Jewie which has an armed police barracks and then the
*09:05.520- 09:10.580* :  internal affairs minister told me that they also attacked a police barracks where he said that
*09:10.580- 09:15.900* :  he seized arms and ammunition and attacks on prisons in at least one case prisoners being freed.
*09:16.180- 09:20.700* :  At least in the countries two main prison facilities the attackers went there and then they set
*09:20.700- 09:25.020* :  free all the prisoners thousands of them and then they went to the female prison and released
*09:25.020- 09:30.860* :  all the female prisoners. I saw at least two sets of prisoners working with I mean in handcuffs
*09:31.080- 09:34.840* :  and they were roaming all over the place and that was exactly what made a lot of people wake up
*09:34.840- 09:39.700* :  to take seriously the whole of today's development. What is the speculation is to who was behind this?
*09:39.820- 09:43.780* :  It's not clear at all. All we know is some soldiers went into this military barracks and then
*09:43.780- 09:49.020* :  seized the armory. I'm told that at least it doesn't others wear by the president's lodge apparently
*09:49.020- 09:52.740* :  waiting for signal from their colleagues from the barracks and then some presidential guards
*09:52.740- 09:56.940* :  got fined of it and they came down and more or less bothered off that apparent attack
*09:56.940- 10:01.900* :  that was building towards the president's lodge. So it sounds like a coup was at least a possibility
*10:01.900- 10:06.160* :  an attempted coup? It does sound like that otherwise why would soldiers go to the country's main
*10:06.160- 10:09.640* :  military barracks and seize its armory just to get arms and ammunition and get out of the
*10:09.640- 10:13.740* :  place looking so well armed? And why would they want to attack the president's lodge? The government
*10:13.740- 10:18.220* :  is not actually clearly saying that. They are referring to them as bandits and as rogue elements.
*10:18.220- 10:23.920* :  It bears the hallmarks of an attempted military coup and I've got to say that it may be quiet right
*10:23.920- 10:29.980* :  now but nobody is certain. Probably beneath the vinyar of quietness belies some onto what
*10:29.980- 10:35.140* :  intends we don't know so there is real angst here across Frita and even if people are trying to
*10:35.140- 10:41.140* :  not allow themselves to think about something which is more serious than witnessed today. Umaru
*10:41.140- 10:47.860* :  Fafana in free town. Rescue efforts are at a standstill once again at the site of a tunnel collapse
*10:47.940- 10:54.240* :  in the northern Indian state of Uttara-Cand where 41 construction workers have been trapped for two
*10:54.240- 10:59.520* :  weeks as we reported in our previous podcast. Rescueers have been unable to get them out after
*10:59.520- 11:04.860* :  a drilling machine broke down a new specialized piece of equipment called a superheated plasma
*11:05.020- 11:11.820* :  was sent by the Indian Air Force on Sunday but that too has failed. BBC's South Asia correspondent
*11:11.840- 11:17.320* :  Samira Hussein sent this report on the latest setback in attempts to get the workers out.
*11:18.440- 11:24.120* :  About a hundred meters away from me is the mouth of the tunnel and you can hear the worrying of
*11:24.120- 11:32.260* :  machines. That's where all the activity is happening. This is the primary way that emergency workers
*11:32.260- 11:41.280* :  are trying to get to the men that are trapped inside the tunnel. That's the voice of the rescue
*11:41.280- 11:46.980* :  workers speaking to the trapped men. For two weeks they've been cut off from the outside world
*11:46.980- 11:53.240* :  getting food and water from a small pipe. For days crews here have been using this massive
*11:53.640- 12:00.120* :  drilling machine to break through the rubble and they got through almost about 50 meters of debris
*12:00.120- 12:07.080* :  within just a few days but now the machine keeps breaking down because what makes this rescue
*12:07.080- 12:12.440* :  operation so complicated is that they're not only dealing with debris but they're also dealing
*12:12.440- 12:19.100* :  with construction materials and pieces of metal and that's what the drill keeps getting caught on.
*12:19.760- 12:28.060* :  Jodhary Sun Manjit is stuck in the tunnel. He traveled from his village to be here for when he
*12:28.060- 12:35.060* :  gets out. His eldest son died in a construction accident two years ago and he cannot face that
*12:35.060- 12:35.620* :  grief again.
*12:39.260- 12:45.720* :  I pray to God that please don't take this son away from me. All I want is that my son should
*12:45.720- 12:55.060* :  be out. This is my prayer. This is my last wish. It's been almost two weeks since the accident
*12:55.060- 13:03.080* :  and the men are still not out. I asked Bhaskar Kulbe about that. He's the former advisor to the
*13:03.080- 13:07.340* :  Prime Minister and is overseeing the rescue. Why has it taken so long? We're on day 12.
*13:10.840- 13:15.660* :  It's about 7 o'clock in the morning. We've been here an hour and again we've just got a
*13:15.660- 13:21.980* :  call. They've hit another setback. They can't seem to fix the machine inside the tunnel.
*13:22.300- 13:29.000* :  That means the odds of a rescue today are very slim. There are a lot of experts that have been
*13:29.000- 13:34.660* :  brought in to consult on this rescue including Harpal Singh. He's a project manager for a tunnel
*13:34.660- 13:40.020* :  project in Jammu in Kashmir. What could have been done to prevent this accident? I'm not
*13:40.020- 13:46.640* :  trying to speak. What should be done to avoid such kind of a right now or priorities to rescue the
*13:46.640- 13:52.780* :  people. The drilling, the augering has stopped. Arnold Dix is a tunneling expert brought in to
*13:52.780- 13:57.840* :  help with the rescue. The auger is broken. The machine is busted. It's irreparable.
*13:58.760- 14:04.780* :  And once again, officials here are back to exploring every available option. This is a rescue
*14:04.780- 14:11.340* :  operation that's just been marred by technical difficulties. Families gathered here have gone from
*14:11.340- 14:17.060* :  hope that the men will be out soon to now wondering how many more days they will remain trapped.
*14:18.500- 14:24.820* :  Samera Hussein. A novel about Ireland and the grip of a totalitarian status won this year's
*14:24.820- 14:30.120* :  prestigious Booker Prize. Profitsong is the fifth book by the Irish writer Paul Lynch.
*14:30.460- 14:34.800* :  Our culture editor Casey Razzle was at the awards ceremony in London.
*14:35.320- 14:39.980* :  The Booker judges said they were looking for a novel that didn't just transport them but spoke
*14:39.980- 14:44.620* :  to the troubling times we're in. In a week which saw riots on the streets of Dublin,
*14:44.620- 14:50.720* :  Profitsong feels just that. This dystopia novel begins with a chilling knock at the door of the
*14:50.720- 14:56.120* :  home of a trade union official and depicts a family grappling with a terrifying new reality.
*14:56.120- 15:00.200* :  Secret police, disappearances and state-sponsored violence.
*15:00.200- 15:03.220* :  Essie Adusion is this year's chair of the judges.
*15:03.760- 15:06.920* :  It's kind of a timely novel given what's going on in the world right now.
*15:07.480- 15:11.900* :  But it also had a kind of timeless quality to it where we felt that this was a book that would
*15:11.900- 15:17.580* :  endure. Paul Lynch says the Syrian refugee crisis prompted him to write Profitsong
*15:17.940- 15:21.620* :  which is also a reaction to the populism and nationalism of our age.
*15:22.380- 15:23.180* :  Katie Razzle
*15:24.040- 15:28.820* :  And staying on the subject of literature, an extremely rare copy of a book which was once owned
*15:28.820- 15:33.660* :  by the English novelist Jane Austin and has her own underlinings has been unveiled
*15:34.340- 15:36.880* :  and is going under the hammer at Southern Business Month.
*15:36.920- 15:43.160* :  So what does this book cure us at his of literature by Isaac Disraeli tell us about Jane Austin's
*15:43.160- 15:48.580* :  influences? My colleague Rebecca Kesby has been speaking to Catherine Sutherland, Professor
*15:48.580- 15:54.340* :  of Literature at the University of Oxford. There were lots of volumes of curiosities of literature.
*15:54.340- 16:01.460* :  This one and certainly the marginal marks in this one suggest that lots of the curiosities
*16:01.460- 16:08.660* :  center around comparative religion and superstition. Yes, one of the sections that has been
*16:08.660- 16:15.260* :  underlined is the fair sex having no souls. What does that mean? That's an argument that went on
*16:15.260- 16:21.320* :  through the 18th century and an early feminist, a woman called Mary Astil was arguing very strongly,
*16:21.320- 16:27.440* :  of course, that women do have souls. Other sections that are underlined or have marginal lines
*16:27.480- 16:34.340* :  are on the custom of saluting after sneezing. And there's a section that's underlined different
*16:34.340- 16:40.820* :  habits of eating in different societies. I think to suggest that Jane Austin made those
*16:40.820- 16:47.260* :  underlinings or linings is pretty tenuous to be honest. Nevertheless, I mean, it is more than
*16:47.260- 16:56.000* :  200 years since her death. Why is she even more popular than ever now? She's accessible and
*16:56.020- 17:02.060* :  their great romantic stories with her kind of feet on the ground. They seem within the realms of
*17:02.060- 17:07.220* :  the possible. I mean, a lot of people who haven't read the books and many men I know that sort of
*17:07.220- 17:11.620* :  poo-poo them as being romantic. They're not just about romance. They're are they? Because there is
*17:11.620- 17:16.500* :  quite a bit of politics or social commentary going on in there as well. Well, I think it's quite
*17:16.500- 17:22.880* :  interesting that Virginia Wolf gave her copy of this book owned by Jane Austin to main arcane's
*17:22.880- 17:29.340* :  economist because Jane Austin's romance is really very hard-headed. Her women always fall in love with
*17:29.340- 17:34.980* :  the man with the biggest state. And there's a reason for this. So, in women had no real possessions
*17:34.980- 17:41.780* :  of their own, no chance of earning a living, no chance of significant inheritance in their own
*17:41.780- 17:49.000* :  right. If you didn't marry, you ended up in a life of extreme economic hardship. She understood that
*17:49.280- 17:55.340* :  life for women had a price and they had to get the best price they could for themselves during
*17:55.340- 18:00.980* :  the time when they were considered to be romantically available as it were. She, of course, never did
*18:00.980- 18:07.360* :  get married, did she? But determined to make money, she did best to make money through her writing.
*18:07.860- 18:13.780* :  So, when we look at this period in history, so much of it has been written by men. So,
*18:13.780- 18:21.280* :  how important is her fiction to us understanding that period in British history? She is very restricted
*18:21.280- 18:25.980* :  in the society she looks at. She doesn't look at the upper classes. She doesn't look at the lower
*18:25.980- 18:32.180* :  classes. She's not a child stick-ins, but she does look at the lower gentry to which she belonged,
*18:32.180- 18:37.680* :  which is, I suppose, now the upper middle classes. And she is very much aware of that world.
*18:37.680- 18:43.000* :  And I think her description of that world is pretty realistic in social terms.
*18:44.360- 18:48.060* :  Professor Catherine Sutherland speaking to my colleague Rebecca Kesby.
*18:50.460- 18:54.600* :  Still to come in the Global News Podcast. For the people that have passed
*18:54.640- 18:59.900* :  more money and give more money, you can adopt an axolotel for one year or six months.
*19:00.020- 19:03.980* :  But if you don't have enough financial support, you can buy a dinner for them.
*19:04.120- 19:10.260* :  A novel appeal to help save an endangered salamander which could hold the key to medical breakthroughs.
*19:18.140- 19:23.340* :  For more than two years, the co-leaders in Myanmar have been fighting off a variety of challenges,
*19:23.780- 19:29.180* :  organized opposition from ordinary Burmese to military rule, as well as long-term insurgences
*19:29.180- 19:34.540* :  by various ethnic groups. Now, an alliance of rebel groups in the north has taken control of
*19:34.540- 19:39.800* :  another border crossing to China, following intense clashes with the military. Video released
*19:39.800- 19:45.940* :  by a pro-rebel local media source shows the alliance groups flag being raised. Asia Pacific
*19:45.940- 19:50.540* :  Editor Celia Hashan told Oliver Conway more about what's been happening at the border.
*19:51.160- 19:56.680* :  Well, this is a really important development in this the Brotherhood Alliance, as they call
*19:56.680- 20:03.360* :  themselves, their battle against the ruling military, Jinta. Now, it's not just a loss of territory
*20:03.420- 20:09.380* :  for the alliances flagged to be raised over this border crossing, but it has actually
*20:09.380- 20:14.140* :  alarmed China. They're holding military exercises just on the other side of the border,
*20:14.620- 20:20.680* :  but it's also a big financial loss for the Jinta itself because a lot of trade crossed over
*20:20.680- 20:27.780* :  that border crossing, $1.3 billion in trade in the first six months of this year. And the loss
*20:27.780- 20:34.160* :  of that trading route is really serious for the Jinta. That's because they really need the foreign
*20:34.160- 20:40.820* :  income and the taxes that they could get from that trade ever since the Jinta staged a coup
*20:40.820- 20:45.940* :  almost three years ago. They've really been dependent on trade with China because so many Western
*20:45.940- 20:51.160* :  countries have imposed sanctions. And so the loss of those key trading routes really is going to
*20:51.160- 20:57.040* :  hit the Jinta hard. Yeah, and how serious a military threat is this to the Jinta. Remind us of the
*20:57.040- 21:03.360* :  the various forces taking them on. As you mentioned just a minute ago, for years, in some cases,
*21:03.360- 21:10.860* :  decades, ethnic rebel groups have been really battling the ruling government in Myanmar. The
*21:10.860- 21:14.320* :  government has changed over the years, but those ethnic groups have been fighting for autonomy
*21:14.320- 21:19.900* :  for quite some time. Now, what's new here is that those groups are increasingly forming alliances
*21:19.900- 21:25.680* :  with each other and they're coordinating their attacks. And really the military simply just can't
*21:25.680- 21:30.480* :  handle fighting on all these different fronts. So we have fighting along the northern border with
*21:30.480- 21:36.400* :  China. We have increased fighting along the Thai border, the Indian border. Myanmar's military
*21:36.400- 21:42.320* :  simply doesn't have the capacity to handle all of these different battles at once. And that's really
*21:42.320- 21:48.240* :  what's changed. And that's really what's making even the government, the acting president of Myanmar,
*21:49.020- 21:54.060* :  admitted just a few weeks ago that the country could split into part. So it's not just being
*21:54.060- 21:59.440* :  hit economically, but it's also being hit militarily. And very briefly, is China beefing up security
*21:59.440- 22:05.280* :  on that border? Oh, absolutely. I mean, there are some who think that actually China sort of gave a
*22:05.280- 22:11.160* :  tacit approval to this alliance because they don't think that the alliance could have banded
*22:11.160- 22:15.900* :  together to gain so much territory from the junta without China's approval. But yes,
*22:15.900- 22:20.440* :  many in China are worried because that border has always been very poor. In fact, some call it the
*22:20.440- 22:25.240* :  wild wild east because there's always been a lot of crime and that border has always been a bit
*22:25.240- 22:32.340* :  shaky and tenuous. Celia Hatton. For a year and nine months, Ukraine has been battling for its
*22:32.340- 22:38.100* :  survival, trying to push back the Russian invaders who currently control about 18% of its territory.
*22:38.600- 22:43.600* :  Overnight on Friday into Saturday, it faced its heaviest drone attack of the war.
*22:43.600- 22:48.960* :  But now it's turning its attention to whether to hold a presidential election next year.
*22:49.400- 22:53.580* :  President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this month that it's not the right time,
*22:53.580- 22:58.600* :  but right wing politicians in the U.S. have indicated that funding could be cut off
*22:58.920- 23:05.240* :  unless an election takes place in Ukraine. The BBC's Abdul-Jolil Abdul-Rassalov sent this report from
*23:05.240- 23:15.780* :  Kiev. I'm in a metro station in central Kiev. There's an air raid siren that just went off and
*23:15.780- 23:22.880* :  lots of people are now heading down into this station which is used as a bombs shelter during air raid
*23:23.280- 23:29.740* :  alerts. There are lots of kits, backpacks and mans sitting on the ground. This is just another
*23:29.740- 23:35.900* :  reminder how difficult, how extremely difficult it will be for Ukraine to hold elections simply
*23:35.900- 23:42.760* :  because of safety issues. More than 8 million Ukrainians are now refugees abroad and about 1 million
*23:42.760- 23:48.680* :  are serving on the frontline defending the country. Now election can be called fair if these people
*23:48.680- 23:57.940* :  are not able to participate. Earlier this month, President Zelensky in a video address tried
*23:57.940- 24:03.780* :  to ease tensions by saying that it wasn't the right time to hold elections and everyone should
*24:03.780- 24:11.340* :  focus instead on defending the nation. But will this statement end the debate? Some observers say
*24:11.340- 24:18.620* :  no and one of the reasons is the U.S. party politics. The wave of this messaging that we need to
*24:18.620- 24:25.700* :  organize elections was started by the group of American politicians which targeted the budget
*24:25.700- 24:32.660* :  in process for Ukrainian financial aid and military aid. Olga Ivazovska is the chairperson of the
*24:32.660- 24:39.960* :  civil network OPPORA that monitors elections. A total majority wants to continue support Ukraine
*24:40.900- 24:47.340* :  at the same time. It doesn't mean that far-right wing of this party will not use this topic against
*24:47.340- 24:52.940* :  Ukraine next year during their presidential elections in the U.S. And they're doing it already.
*24:52.940- 24:58.860* :  Ukraine is not a paragon of democracy. This is Vivek Ramas Mami, one of the Republican candidates
*24:58.860- 25:03.260* :  for presidential nomination. It is threatened not to hold elections this year unless the U.S.
*25:03.260- 25:07.960* :  forks over more money. That is not democratic. President Zelensky understands that he needs to
*25:07.960- 25:13.360* :  address this growing rhetoric coming from the U.S. the main ally whose military aid is vital for
*25:13.360- 25:23.040* :  Ukraine to fight the war against Russia. There are a few things that can split the U.S.
*25:23.040- 25:27.920* :  support of Ukraine. Mr. Zelensky said in an interview to Ukrainian TV last August.
*25:28.820- 25:34.100* :  One of them is the elections he said and added that he had heard voices within the Republican
*25:34.100- 25:36.780* :  party against providing support to Ukraine.
*25:47.560- 25:52.600* :  As Ukrainian MPs sing the national anthem in the parliament, they seem to agree that they
*25:52.600- 25:58.520* :  cannot afford to plunge back into the old-time political standoff while they're fighting Russia.
*25:59.600- 26:04.200* :  But the longer the war drags on, the harder it will be to maintain these consensus.
*26:05.060- 26:09.800* :  Partly because of domestic rivalry of Ukraine's western partners.
*26:14.000- 26:16.400* :  Abdul Jalil Abdul-Rasalov in Kiev.
*26:17.700- 26:23.540* :  Scientists in Mexico are asking people to help care for a critically endangered species of
*26:23.540- 26:30.520* :  salamander known as the Axolotl. Researchers say the creature's ability to regrow body parts
*26:30.520- 26:36.140* :  may help in the study of tissue repair and even cancer treatment. Rachel Wright spoke to
*26:36.140- 26:41.320* :  Professor Luis Zambrano, a biologist from the National University of Mexico.
*26:42.000- 26:46.460* :  The Axolotl is an amphibian, it's a salamander, but it's a special kind of salamanders.
*26:46.460- 26:52.840* :  Normally salamanders are like lizards with bright colors, but this salamander particularly doesn't
*26:53.180- 27:00.360* :  leave the water. They never transform from juveniles to adulthood. They have external gills,
*27:00.360- 27:07.240* :  which looks like a crown over the head and they have this eternal smile, so that is the Axolotl.
*27:07.520- 27:12.900* :  But what's so amazing about them though is that they have the ability to regrow their own limbs.
*27:12.900- 27:19.300* :  Tell me about that. That's the reason a lot of laughs around the world are using this salamander.
*27:19.300- 27:25.440* :  The actually Axolotl are the animal that is by far the most studied animal in the
*27:25.440- 27:31.860* :  laughs in the world because they can regrow any part of the body. The limbs, they can regrow the
*27:31.860- 27:37.080* :  gills and they also they can regrow even part of the brain if they lose part of the brain.
*27:37.080- 27:43.180* :  So these animals are fantastic in terms of trying to study how are the mechanisms for
*27:43.180- 27:48.660* :  try to regrow tissues in human beings. But I understand that there used to be lots and now there's
*27:48.660- 27:54.440* :  very few. Why is that? The only place they live in the wild is in the south part of Mexico City.
*27:54.620- 28:00.140* :  I mean Mexico City used to be in a huge wetland and the wetland is now reduced in the 2% of the
*28:00.140- 28:05.820* :  original coverage and the water quality has been reduced and that's the reason the Axolotl
*28:05.820- 28:13.360* :  changed the population from 20 years ago. We have about 6,000 per kilometer squared and now we only
*28:13.360- 28:19.440* :  have less than 36 per kilometer squared. They are almost in the state. So you're launching a campaign
*28:19.440- 28:25.640* :  to help them. Tell me about your adopt an Axolotl campaign. We are looking for receiving
*28:25.640- 28:30.400* :  financial support from all the world. For the people that has more money and give more money,
*28:30.400- 28:36.420* :  you can adopt an Axolotl for one year or six months. But if you don't have enough financial support,
*28:36.420- 28:41.240* :  you can buy a dinner for them. What kind of food could you buy for them? What's their dinner
*28:41.240- 28:47.440* :  would consist of? They normally feed on small fishes, for example, or small cry fishes or even
*28:47.440- 28:53.400* :  small worms. The idea is to use this money for have a very nice quality of life of these animals.
*28:54.340- 28:58.800* :  Professor Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico.
*29:00.280- 29:05.220* :  The world of football has been paying tribute to the former England manager Terry Venables,
*29:05.220- 29:10.440* :  who's died at the age of 80. He led England through one of its most fondly remembered periods,
*29:10.440- 29:17.100* :  culminating in the Euro 96 campaign held in England where his team lost to Germany on penalties
*29:17.640- 29:24.140* :  in the semifinal. Our sports correspondent Nesta McGregor looks back at his time on and off the pitch.
*29:24.720- 29:31.500* :  Terry Venables dedicated almost 50 years to football. He made his debut for Chelsea as a teenager
*29:31.500- 29:38.080* :  before going on to play for Tottenham and Queen's part-rangers, but it was as a manager. He truly
*29:38.080- 29:47.200* :  blossomed. Venables is best known for the summer of 1996 when he was in charge of an England side
*29:47.200- 29:56.780* :  vying for glory at the European Championships. Although the journey ended in semifinal heartache,
*29:56.780- 30:02.600* :  losing to Germany on penalties, the team was credited with bringing the feel good factor back
*30:03.020- 30:10.680* :  to England fans. Speaking after the tournament, Venables said it was a career-defining moment.
*30:29.900- 30:35.380* :  Before England came calling, Terry Venables managed Queen's part-rangers and Tottenham. He also gained
*30:35.380- 30:40.880* :  respect across Europe, winning these Spanish league titles during three years in charge of Barcelona.
*30:40.940- 30:47.400* :  The former England captain, Gary Linnaker, played for Terry Venables at Barcelona and at Tottenham.
*30:47.600- 30:51.480* :  It doesn't matter which player you speak to that's played for Terry, whether it was players
*30:51.480- 31:00.060* :  probably way back at Crystal Palace or QPR or Barcelona. All of them would speak incredibly
*31:00.060- 31:08.940* :  highly of them, not just as a coach, but also as a human being and a lovely, lovely, fun man.
*31:09.260- 31:13.660* :  Today, the current England manager, Gareth Southgate, also paid tribute to Venables,
*31:13.660- 31:20.460* :  describing him as an outstanding coach, capable of handling the youngest player to the biggest star.
*31:20.880- 31:26.200* :  Other players have also remembered the man who brought English football one of its most famous summers.
*31:27.180- 31:28.680* :  Next term, a Gregor reporting.
*31:31.140- 31:36.780* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*31:37.180- 31:40.840* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
