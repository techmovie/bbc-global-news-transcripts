*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.340* :  by advertising. Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
*00:20.460- 00:25.440* :  Our billionaire this episode is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*00:25.720- 00:32.500* :  At its peak, WeWork was worth $47 billion. And Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*00:32.580- 00:37.620* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila and made people do shots during business meetings.
*00:37.840- 00:42.640* :  His modest aspirations, including wanting to live forever, to become the world's first trillionaire
*00:42.640- 00:48.360* :  and expand his company to Mars. What we learned in the last couple of weeks is in reality, he oversaw
*00:48.360- 00:53.600* :  one of the most spectacular business failures in modern history. So is he good, bad, or just another
*00:53.600- 00:57.820* :  billionaire? To find out, listen to good, bad billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*01:03.340- 01:07.560* :  It's exhilarating. It's like driving a car under an avalanche,
*01:07.760- 01:11.180* :  but you're taunting the avalanche rather than trying to get away from it.
*01:11.700- 01:17.920* :  Amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*01:18.940- 01:22.240* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.500- 01:29.200* :  I'm Andrew Peach and in the early hours of Wednesday 8th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:29.260- 01:34.480* :  A member of Israel's war cabinet says the country has no plans to govern Gaza,
*01:34.480- 01:39.760* :  but will ensure it remains demilitarized after the war is over. The international red cross
*01:39.760- 01:43.840* :  has a convoy delivering aid supplies has come under fire in Gaza City.
*01:44.600- 01:48.320* :  At least seven people have been killed in an attack in the Afghan capital
*01:48.560- 01:51.180* :  that appears to have been aimed at the ethnic Hasara community.
*01:53.540- 01:58.660* :  Also in this podcast, weather and climate is what has caused these problems this year
*01:58.660- 02:00.560* :  in both northern and southern hemispheres.
*02:00.980- 02:05.800* :  Wine production around the world is expected to fall to its lowest level in more than half a century
*02:06.200- 02:07.320* :  because of extreme weather.
*02:11.780- 02:15.960* :  It's been a month since Hamas gunmen stormed across the border and attacked southern Israel,
*02:15.960- 02:21.860* :  killing 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages. People across the country have
*02:21.860- 02:26.860* :  observed minute silence and a service for bereaved families has taken place in Tel Aviv.
*02:27.500- 02:33.220* :  As Israel continues its retaliation against Hamas in Gaza, aid workers say a tragedy of colossal
*02:33.220- 02:38.320* :  proportions is unfolding. Christian Linmay is a spokesman for the World Health Organization.
*02:38.880- 02:46.260* :  The level of death and suffering is hard to fathom. Over 1,400 people have reportedly died in Israel
*02:47.280- 02:56.080* :  and just over 11,000 have now been reported dead in Gaza. That's a half percent of the population
*02:56.080- 03:04.580* :  of Gaza. An average of about 160 children are killed every day. Nothing justifies the horror
*03:04.580- 03:11.360* :  being endured by the civilians in Gaza. A member of Israel's war cabinet has clarified
*03:11.360- 03:16.940* :  comments made earlier by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the future of Gaza
*03:16.940- 03:23.160* :  after the conflict. On Derma, the Ministry of Strategic Affairs told the BBC that when Mr Netanyahu
*03:23.160- 03:28.400* :  said Israel would take overall security responsibility for Gaza, he meant it would ensure
*03:28.400- 03:33.360* :  Gaza remained a demilitarized area. The Prime Minister was not saying that
*03:33.920- 03:38.220* :  Israel was going to reoccupy Gaza. We, Israel was going to govern Gaza. You know, governance
*03:38.220- 03:43.820* :  requires an administration that we assume will be Palestinian. You'll have to have internal
*03:43.820- 03:47.480* :  policing and there's a question of who will do that. You'll have to deal with reconstruction
*03:47.640- 03:52.060* :  and how that would be done. There's a question of the overriding security responsibility.
*03:52.060- 03:57.260* :  That's what he was talking about to ensure that in a post-Hamas Gaza, we don't have the
*03:57.260- 04:03.260* :  re-emergence of a terror threat from in Gaza. Earlier, the Israeli Defense Minister Yav Galand
*04:03.260- 04:08.240* :  confirmed that for the first time in decades, IDF forces are now in the heart of Gaza City.
*04:08.240- 04:14.420* :  He said the leader of Hamas in Gaza is surrounded in his bunker. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*04:14.420- 04:20.640* :  gave a TV address in Tel Aviv where he once again rejected a ceasefire until all hostages have been
*04:20.640- 04:27.900* :  released. There will not be a ceasefire until all hostages come home. I would like to now speak to
*04:27.980- 04:35.100* :  all the families in this ongoing nightmare that there are suffering. We are working in every possible
*04:35.260- 04:42.760* :  way on every front in order to bring your cherished family members, our cherished family members,
*04:42.760- 04:48.360* :  home. I spoke to my correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams, and asked him for more on the Israeli
*04:48.360- 04:53.040* :  military advance in Gaza City, how in control are the IDF forces there now?
*04:53.660- 05:00.440* :  I think increasingly in control, we've seen pictures of Israeli armored vehicles on the coastal
*05:00.700- 05:09.020* :  road right in the heart of Gaza. They say that they have established some kind of foothold,
*05:09.020- 05:14.680* :  that they have destroyed a Hamas command center, and I think they are operating now across
*05:14.680- 05:19.920* :  probably several parts of the wider Gaza City area. That's an area that includes
*05:19.920- 05:26.580* :  not just Gaza City, but also two refugee camps. I think they are operating with increasing freedom,
*05:26.580- 05:32.900* :  but this is a large area. It's a very built-up area. There are still, we think, potentially
*05:33.820- 05:38.140* :  tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of civilians there too, in addition to however many
*05:38.140- 05:43.540* :  Hamas fighters are there. I don't think we should, any of us, should think that the battle for
*05:43.540- 05:49.340* :  Gaza City is going to be over anytime soon. In terms of Benjamin Netanyahu on the TV,
*05:49.340- 05:54.560* :  and not really any new sentiment to his comments, but at least a hint of the possibility
*05:54.620- 06:00.300* :  of a ceasefire or a pause if there is the release of the hostages. That has been the Israeli
*06:00.300- 06:06.640* :  position for some weeks now that there is absolutely no prospect of a ceasefire, unless
*06:06.640- 06:12.500* :  Israel sees its missing hostages return home. And not just that, but there isn't really much of a
*06:12.500- 06:16.880* :  chance of even of a humanitarian pause, the phrase that the Americans coined some time ago,
*06:17.480- 06:22.600* :  unless there's proper news of the hostages. The Israelis say, we have to see the International
*06:22.600- 06:27.520* :  Committee of the Red Cross being given access to the hostages. I think the Israelis know perfectly
*06:27.520- 06:32.600* :  well that Hamas is not going to give that kind of access, but that is a demand they continue to make.
*06:32.600- 06:37.520* :  And in the absence of that, we are seeing absolutely no let up in the fighting either in terms
*06:37.520- 06:40.840* :  of what's going on in the air, or indeed the operations on the ground.
*06:41.540- 06:46.320* :  The International Committee of the Red Cross says a humanitarian convoy delivering life-saving
*06:46.320- 06:52.660* :  medical supplies has come under fire in Gaza City. The organization said two of five trucks were
*06:52.660- 06:57.680* :  damaged and a driver was injured, but the convoy was able to deliver the supplies after changing
*06:57.680- 07:03.880* :  its route. The ICRC's president had warned earlier on Tuesday that Israel's massive bombardment
*07:03.880- 07:09.440* :  of Gaza was sowing the seeds of hardship for generations to come. Meanwhile, hundreds more
*07:09.440- 07:14.760* :  Palestinians would be moving to the south of the territory. A Gaza correspondent, Rishdi Abu Alus,
*07:14.760- 07:20.880* :  sent this report from Khan Yunis in southern Gaza. Today we are having more people coming from
*07:20.880- 07:26.760* :  Gaza City into the south-run bar. In fact, they were walking about five kilometers because the
*07:26.760- 07:32.420* :  road leads to a Gaza City was damaged. They were called Salah-e-Din Road, which Israel
*07:32.420- 07:38.920* :  advising me to take into the south. I have met some people who were like walking a very long way
*07:38.920- 07:45.160* :  to make it because no access to the road. One month on, it's still Hamas able to fire rockets,
*07:45.160- 07:50.680* :  it's still fighting going on in eight different fronts in Gaza, especially in the north-west and
*07:50.680- 07:56.800* :  south-west of Gaza where Israel's ground liberation has been expanding and the grip around Gaza City
*07:56.800- 08:03.160* :  has been tightening and the humanitarian situation there is really at the catastrophe of hunger.
*08:03.520- 08:09.100* :  I was talking to a father of nine people there. Communication is very hard, but between time
*08:09.100- 08:14.700* :  new time we catch someone there. He said, I have no food, I have no money, and I have no water.
*08:14.700- 08:20.440* :  There is no clean water because all of the aid that coming from Egypt, which is very little
*08:20.440- 08:25.420* :  according to the Iran, not reaching those about half million people who live in Gaza City
*08:25.780- 08:30.680* :  and the north here in the south. Situation isn't bitter, it's quite a little bit,
*08:31.060- 08:36.040* :  less air strikes, but the struggle to find food and water and the struggle for the hospital to
*08:36.040- 08:40.860* :  find medicine is also continued. Our Gaza correspondent, Rushdie Abowalouf,
*08:41.100- 08:44.740* :  more on the BBC Live page, BBC.com slash news.
*08:45.840- 08:50.500* :  Police in suburban Los Angeles have stepped up patrols around synagogues and mosques
*08:50.740- 08:55.820* :  after a Jewish man died during clashes between pro and anti-Israel demonstrators.
*08:56.400- 09:01.400* :  Detectives are trying to establish how 69-year-old Paul Kessler came to fall and hit his head
*09:01.400- 09:06.020* :  during a confrontation with a counter-protester. Here's our correspondent David Willis.
*09:06.420- 09:11.240* :  Law enforcement officials say Paul Kessler, who was carrying and is really flagged at the
*09:11.240- 09:16.640* :  demonstration, died after being knocked backwards during a confrontation with a counter-protester
*09:16.640- 09:23.100* :  and hitting his head. The protest is thought to have attracted around 100 pro and anti-Israel
*09:23.100- 09:28.160* :  demonstrators and officials say they haven't ruled out the possibility of a hate crime.
*09:28.160- 09:33.580* :  They've identified a suspect, but so far nobody has been charged in connection with the death.
*09:34.260- 09:38.500* :  The Taliban authorities in Afghanistan say at least seven people have been killed
*09:38.500- 09:44.220* :  in an explosion on a bus in the capital Kabul. 20 others were injured. Here's our South Asia
*09:44.220- 09:48.900* :  regional editor and barrison ethe rajan. It was the third blast in less than a month in
*09:48.900- 09:55.260* :  dusty butchy area of the Afghan capital dominated by the ethnic Azara community. The Taliban say
*09:55.260- 10:00.620* :  they are investigating an explosion inside a sports club in the same neighborhood kill four
*10:00.620- 10:05.880* :  people in late October. The Islamic State groups said it carried out that attack. The UN
*10:05.880- 10:11.340* :  Special Reporter Richard Bennett has called for a transparent investigation into the repeated
*10:11.340- 10:16.800* :  attacks on the Azara community. Let's go to Portugal now where the Prime Minister has resigned
*10:16.800- 10:22.100* :  in connection with a corruption scandal. Antonio Coshter announced his decision on television
*10:22.440- 10:25.440* :  just hours after prosecutors detained his chief of staff.
*10:28.300- 10:33.060* :  Today I was surprised with the officially confirmed information that criminal proceedings
*10:33.060- 10:38.880* :  have been or will be brought against me. That's why in my understanding the dignity of the duties
*10:38.880- 10:44.440* :  of Prime Minister is not compatible with any suspicion of his integrity. In these circumstances
*10:44.440- 10:49.820* :  I have obviously handed in my resignation to his excellency the president of the Republic.
*10:52.600- 10:57.100* :  A correspondent Alison Roberts is in Lisbon and told me more about those corruption allegations.
*10:57.740- 11:03.000* :  Mr Coshter has been in power as Prime Minister for just under eight years and this has really come
*11:03.000- 11:07.340* :  as a complete bombshell. He himself said as you heard there that he was surprised by the information
*11:07.420- 11:13.080* :  and there were no leaks as there often are in these kind of investigations but the Attorney General's
*11:13.080- 11:18.920* :  Office this morning released fairly lengthy statement saying that an investigation is going on
*11:18.920- 11:25.020* :  into several major government-backed projects in some lithium mines in the north of Portugal
*11:25.540- 11:32.780* :  in a hydrogen-fired power plant which is planned at a major port south of Lisbon and also a data center
*11:32.780- 11:38.420* :  in that same area in the town of Senish. Now the fact that the Prime Minister has apparently been
*11:38.840- 11:44.160* :  caught up in in some wiretaps that's to say telephone conversations with a former minister or
*11:44.160- 11:49.420* :  with current ministers and that's the information that was exchanged was of interest. As a result of
*11:49.420- 11:54.300* :  that he is now in a separate investigation which is overseen by the Supreme Court because of the
*11:54.300- 12:00.100* :  seniority of his government position. So although he is himself not an official suspect he made
*12:00.100- 12:06.840* :  a point of stressing that in his declaration to the nation he said that it's incompatible
*12:06.840- 12:12.920* :  with his remaining in his position as Prime Minister but there are two ministers and one former
*12:12.920- 12:18.400* :  minister who we understand have been named as official suspects and also the Prime Minister's
*12:18.440- 12:23.420* :  chief of staff has actually been detained along with four other people who are under investigation
*12:23.420- 12:27.980* :  in this case. Now every country does this differently so in Portugal when the Prime Minister
*12:27.980- 12:33.540* :  resigns what happens. So he submits his resignation to the president and in this case the president
*12:33.540- 12:39.960* :  accepted it so we can certainly say that he has indeed resigned. The president now has to decide
*12:39.960- 12:45.680* :  what he should do. He said in this Prime Minister word to step down in that case it was in the
*12:45.680- 12:51.600* :  context to be impossibly going to some job as a European Union bigwig. If he were to step down
*12:51.600- 12:55.720* :  then he would dissolve parliament and call elections rather than for example waiting for the
*12:55.720- 13:00.760* :  governing socialist party to cook forward a new leader. So it's pretty much taken as given that
*13:00.760- 13:05.240* :  he will call elections but first he has to consult the parties and his council of state.
*13:05.940- 13:10.920* :  Alison Roberts in Lisbon. Assembly has taken place in Singapore to announce this year's winners
*13:10.920- 13:16.200* :  that the Prince of Wales is earth shot prize. This award honors people who are developing solutions

*13:21.580- 13:27.960* :  project around 1.2 million US dollars. Our Royal correspondent Daniela Ralph was at the ceremony.
*13:28.480- 13:34.840* :  On a stifling hot day in Singapore interrupted by a heavy showers the earth shot finalist
*13:35.160- 13:37.660* :  mixed with celebrity guests on the green carpet.
*13:40.160- 13:44.980* :  Hello and welcome to the earth shot prize 2023.
*13:46.380- 13:49.580* :  Inside the award ceremony the Prince of Wales addressed the audience

*13:55.760- 14:02.280* :  remind us that no matter where you are on our planet the spirit of ingenuity and the ability to
*14:02.280- 14:08.400* :  inspire change surrounds us all. Five projects each one a million pounds for their environmental
*14:08.400- 14:14.780* :  solutions. They included a new way to build and recycle lithium batteries which are used in
*14:14.780- 14:21.240* :  electric vehicles. A forest protection scheme in the Andes and wild aid and ocean conservation
*14:21.240- 14:28.000* :  project across the Americas run by Megan Brosnan. It's just really hopeful. It can be really lonely
*14:28.000- 14:34.060* :  to do this work and it makes you feel supported and lifted up. The winners of the earth shot prize
*14:34.060- 14:40.360* :  get more than just the money. They also secure access to the contacts and influence of Prince William
*14:40.940- 14:45.560* :  which past winners say has been invaluable. Our all correspondent Daniela Ralph.
*14:47.900- 14:53.500* :  Still to come? The images beamed back by the Euclid Space Telescope provide a stunning new view
*14:53.500- 14:59.100* :  of the cosmos. One shows the purple and pink clouds of the horse head nebula where stars are
*14:59.100- 15:05.300* :  born. The European Space Agency releases the first images from its unique Space Telescope as it
*15:05.500- 15:08.960* :  continues to investigate the cosmic mysteries like dark matter.
*15:16.760- 15:20.880* :  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
*15:21.020- 15:25.980* :  Our billionaire this episode is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*15:25.980- 15:33.060* :  Adam's peak WeWork was worth 47 billion dollars and Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*15:33.100- 15:38.160* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila and made people do shots during business meetings.
*15:38.380- 15:43.180* :  His modest aspirations including wanting to live forever to become the world's first trillionaire
*15:43.180- 15:48.440* :  and expand his company to Mars. What we learned in the last couple of weeks is in reality he
*15:48.440- 15:53.760* :  oversaw one of the most spectacular business failures in modern history. So is he good, bad or just
*15:53.760- 15:58.360* :  another billionaire? To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*16:04.600- 16:09.500* :  Suddenly my quilt is ripped off me and my room is full of white men and I thought I'm done for.
*16:09.600- 16:14.180* :  These are fascists they found where I live. Life's less ordinary is the podcast from the BBC

*16:31.180- 16:39.580* :  podcasts. Next to Sudan, whether reports of widespread ethnic killings in the Darfur region,
*16:40.120- 16:43.640* :  as fighting between the country's two rival armed groups continues,
*16:43.640- 16:48.060* :  it's ordinary civilians who are caught in the middle. I've been finding out more from our
*16:48.060- 16:53.760* :  Africa regional editor Will Ross. It is very difficult to get precise information as to what's
*16:53.760- 16:59.420* :  happening, but certainly there have been some very disturbing reports from a place called Adamata,
*16:59.420- 17:07.420* :  which is in an area that the rapid support forces the RSF have just taken over from the Sudanese
*17:07.420- 17:12.100* :  military, not clear whether there was a withdrawal or whether there was a proper fight for this place,
*17:12.100- 17:18.640* :  but the RSF are now in charge, and civilians are saying that the RSF have been going around with
*17:18.640- 17:26.980* :  their allied militias, basically looking for people who are from the Masalite ethnic group,
*17:26.980- 17:33.720* :  and there have been many civilian deaths. There are photos on social media of bodies on the streets
*17:33.720- 17:39.620* :  of Adamata, and that fits in with some of the other accounts from people who are talking about
*17:40.300- 17:45.540* :  raids on homes, and this is a pattern we've seen in other areas that the RSF have taken over,
*17:46.100- 17:52.740* :  and separately we've just heard from Midsonson Frontier that just in the last few days more people
*17:52.740- 17:59.980* :  have crossed the border into Chad than during the entire month before that, 7,000 people just
*17:59.980- 18:05.360* :  during the first three days of November, mostly women and children, so they're saying a real
*18:05.780- 18:11.780* :  upsurge in the violence, which seems to be coinciding with the RSF taking over these areas in
*18:11.780- 18:16.680* :  Western Darfur, that's close to Chad's border, and then people are fleeing across the border,
*18:16.680- 18:22.440* :  but they really are trapped in these places, and many of them have been displaced for years and
*18:22.440- 18:27.580* :  years because of the Darfur conflict that happened about 20 years ago. Because the UN has been warning
*18:27.580- 18:33.720* :  of a humanitarian disaster on this border between Sudan and Chad. Yes, and there are ethnic groups that
*18:33.720- 18:39.640* :  straddle the border, so some manage to seek shelter with relatives or people across the border,
*18:39.640- 18:45.400* :  who they have some links with, but there are also camps, but it's been a real struggle for
*18:45.400- 18:50.660* :  agencies to help people not only in Chad, but of course in Sudan itself while the fighting has been
*18:50.660- 18:56.140* :  going on. And are the talks going on now to try to resolve this in some way? There are talks
*18:56.140- 19:02.980* :  going on, and we understand from these talks going on in Jeddah that there has been some kind of a
*19:02.980- 19:10.580* :  breakthrough in that the RSF and the military have agreed to allow humanitarian aid to flow,
*19:11.200- 19:17.220* :  and to kind of build up some trust-building measures between the two sides, but they've stopped
*19:17.220- 19:23.060* :  way short of anything like a ceasefire, which is what everybody in Sudan would like. And there have
*19:23.060- 19:27.860* :  been so many promises before out of talks of not only of ceasefires, but also, yes, we're going to
*19:27.860- 19:33.560* :  allow in humanitarian aid only for it to be far too dangerous and far too many restrictions to be
*19:33.560- 19:40.900* :  put on the aid organizations to allow that aid to flow. Well, Ross reporting, greenwashing is when
*19:40.900- 19:45.980* :  an organization spends more time and money on marketing itself as environmentally friendly
*19:46.460- 19:51.220* :  and actually on minimizing its environmental impact. And that's what a number of multinational
*19:51.220- 19:56.600* :  stand-on Nestle and Coca-Cola are accused of in a legal complaint to the European Commission
*19:56.600- 20:02.200* :  by consumer and environmental groups. Julia Marshall heard more from Rosa Prichard, plastics
*20:02.200- 20:07.700* :  lawyer for client earth, one of the complainants. The European Consumer Protection Organization
*20:07.700- 20:14.760* :  Bayouk with the support of client earth and Ecoslum Environmental Organizations has filed a complaint
*20:14.760- 20:20.440* :  against three multinational fast-moving consumer goods companies that sell bottled water products.
*20:21.440- 20:26.000* :  For making claims about recycling on these products that we consider to be misleading,
*20:26.040- 20:32.920* :  these are namely 100% recycled and 100% recyclable claims and sort of different variations of
*20:32.920- 20:39.160* :  these claims. And you're arguing that this is not the case. Yes, exactly. So we're arguing that
*20:39.160- 20:43.680* :  there's a real risk that consumers are going to be misled by these claims. So firstly, there are
*20:43.680- 20:49.360* :  kind of factual issues related to the claims. For example, if you take the 100% recycled claims
*20:49.440- 20:55.220* :  in kind of, you know, variations of these claims, in any case, the full item that the consumer
*20:55.220- 21:00.700* :  picks up off the shelf with the cap and the label included with the bottle is not fully made
*21:00.700- 21:06.180* :  from recycled plastic. It's only one component of the beverage bottle that is. We also think this
*21:06.180- 21:12.180* :  language around recyclability in 100% recyclable really risks misleading consumers and his ambiguous.
*21:13.040- 21:17.060* :  But we often see also these claims are made with this kind of circular imagery of these like
*21:17.060- 21:22.040* :  infinite loops giving this impression of plastics going round and round or being recycled in
*21:22.040- 21:26.580* :  an endless circle. And sometimes we also see the claims are being made with green imagery and
*21:26.580- 21:32.440* :  sort of environmental statements as well. And that these really risk giving the consumers that
*21:32.440- 21:37.560* :  the impression that these plastic bottles can be a sustainable choice, can be a sustainable product
*21:37.580- 21:41.700* :  and a sustainable choice. And clearly, they have a significant impact on the environment.
*21:42.480- 21:48.420* :  You are mounting this complaint, this legal challenge if you'd like, but these companies
*21:49.280- 21:56.480* :  have been out there recording to you making this 100% recycled claim for quite some time.
*21:56.480- 22:00.960* :  How have they been able to do that? I think kind of in general, we're getting increasingly
*22:00.960- 22:05.740* :  used to seeing claims like this on products, particularly when it comes to the plastics problem,
*22:05.740- 22:11.080* :  there's a huge amount of concern from consumers around plastic pollution. So that gives the consumer
*22:11.080- 22:14.720* :  protection authorities obviously a lot of work to deal with to get on top of these claims.
*22:15.240- 22:18.880* :  There are also really kind of technical aspects to these claims that you really need to
*22:19.460- 22:23.860* :  to go into some detail to explain the realities of the recycling system that it's not necessarily
*22:24.760- 22:28.180* :  everything that we think it is or that we would quite like it to be or that sometimes companies
*22:28.180- 22:33.620* :  give us the impression that it is. And that's why it kind of is so important in this context that
*22:33.620- 22:38.200* :  the authorities really take action because these claims really are very widespread. They are
*22:38.660- 22:44.580* :  quite embedded and very common as well. And have you made these complaints known to the companies
*22:44.580- 22:50.160* :  themselves and if so, what has been their response? I believe there's been a response from Coca-Cola
*22:50.740- 22:55.180* :  in which it kind of states that it considers its claims to be substantiated and it points to the
*22:55.180- 23:01.200* :  importance of giving consumers information about recycling. Actually, on that point, that's really
*23:01.200- 23:06.160* :  something that we really highlight in the complaint is really what matters here is that consumers have
*23:06.160- 23:12.460* :  access to clear and very honest information about recycling. Really, what really counts is that
*23:12.460- 23:16.960* :  we know we're given clear information about how to dispose of our products properly. And that
*23:16.960- 23:21.560* :  doesn't require companies to make claims that might mislead. Consumers, it just requires them to
*23:21.560- 23:27.740* :  simply give very clear instructions on how to properly dispose of a product in that particular
*23:27.740- 23:32.700* :  market with its particular waste management infrastructure and realities. Rosa Prichard from
*23:32.700- 23:38.680* :  Client Earth. The president of Chile, Gabrielle Borich, has signed a new constitution and urged
*23:38.680- 23:43.780* :  voters to take part in a referendum next month on whether to approve it or not. The document was
*23:43.780- 23:48.780* :  drafted by an elected body over the past year. Here's our America's regional editor, Leonardo
*23:48.780- 23:55.280* :  Russia. The current constitution dates back to 1980 when Chile was ruled by General Augusto
*23:55.280- 24:00.800* :  Pinochet. Mr. Borich, a young left-wing leader, came into power promising to replace it,
*24:01.120- 24:07.200* :  but a first attempt failed a year ago when two-thirds of Chilean voters rejected a new draft
*24:07.200- 24:12.860* :  proposed by a left-leaning assembly, which was considered too radical. The latest draft
*24:12.860- 24:19.460* :  protects private pension funds and says all illegal migrants must be expelled. But opinion polls say
*24:19.460- 24:24.540* :  it's also likely to be rejected, which highlights Chile's deep political divisions.
*24:25.680- 24:30.400* :  Now they say life's too short to drink bad wine, but now even bad wine could be in short
*24:30.400- 24:35.560* :  supply. As production around the world is set to fall to its lowest level for over 60 years.
*24:35.580- 24:40.980* :  France has overtaken Italy as the world's leading producer. I spoke to our Paris correspondent
*24:40.980- 24:46.580* :  Husco Field and asked him what's to blame for this foreign wine production. Climate, by which I
*24:46.580- 24:52.260* :  don't necessarily mean climate change, though that might be a factor, but weather and climate is
*24:52.260- 24:57.480* :  what has caused these problems this year in both northern and southern hemisphere. Basically what
*24:57.660- 25:04.820* :  this body, the international organization for wine and the wine does is look at figures in for
*25:04.820- 25:10.640* :  harvest this year, the southern hemisphere harvesters, or six months ago, and the northern hemisphere
*25:10.640- 25:16.420* :  just now, and makes predictions for how much wine will be produced. And it's found that in many,
*25:16.420- 25:22.280* :  many countries, in both hemispheres, bad adverse conditions, which can be drought or
*25:22.280- 25:27.860* :  storms, or it can be hail, or it can be late frosts, which kill the young grapes, have
*25:27.860- 25:33.100* :  meant there's been a big, big fall in likely wine production this year. Harvest have been very,
*25:33.100- 25:40.660* :  very bad. For example, Italy, it's down, what does it sort of 14%, 15% in Argentina, Australia,
*25:40.660- 25:46.720* :  down Manila, quarter, only the US has done well in the northern hemisphere. France has held its own,
*25:46.720- 25:52.440* :  but a lot of countries, like the ones I mentioned, South Africa, Chile, they've seen their production
*25:52.440- 25:58.200* :  really, really fall, or likely production, because the wine hasn't been made yet, but it's based
*25:58.200- 26:04.180* :  on the grape harvest. If we're talking about oil, often producers like the fact that it's in
*26:04.180- 26:07.240* :  short supply, because it means they can put the price up, does it work like that with wine?
*26:07.400- 26:12.240* :  Certainly, I mean, the one is necessarily saying this is bad news for the market. In fact,
*26:12.760- 26:17.540* :  they are more saying that it is good news. I mean, the real problem, as everyone has
*26:18.120- 26:23.020* :  knows, certainly in Europe, has been massive overproduction of wine, and the need to find some way
*26:23.020- 26:28.300* :  of bringing it in. There's a glut, some of it has to be held on the market here in Europe,
*26:28.300- 26:34.260* :  and not hell off the market, and be kept in that, you know, governments pay farmer sometimes
*26:34.260- 26:38.340* :  to destroy their wine. So this is not a bad thing from the market point of view, but it's
*26:38.360- 26:42.420* :  interesting. Of course, it does raise questions whether this is to do with climate change.
*26:42.420- 26:48.440* :  I mean, many people are saying around the world that they can't prove a link. There's no
*26:48.440- 26:52.660* :  question that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and that might be a factor.
*26:53.400- 26:59.060* :  He used to go with me from Paris. Next, the European Space Agency has released the first images
*26:59.060- 27:04.420* :  from the Euclid Space Telescope, a European Space Project, designed to investigate the cosmic
*27:04.420- 27:10.620* :  mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. Over the next six years, Euclid will survey a third of
*27:10.620- 27:15.620* :  the heavens to create what's been built as the most accurate ever 3D map of the universe.
*27:16.240- 27:21.820* :  This from our science editor, Rebecca Morrell. The images beamed back by the Euclid Space Telescope
*27:21.820- 27:27.560* :  provide a stunning new view of the cosmos. One shows the purple and pink clouds of the horse
*27:27.560- 27:34.520* :  nebula, a place more than 1,300 light years away, where stars are born. Another reveals the
*27:34.520- 27:40.580* :  spiraling arms of what's nicknamed the hidden galaxy. It's usually obscured by our own Milky Way.
*27:41.320- 27:45.600* :  Over the course of six years, the mission will survey a billion and a half galaxies.
*27:46.200- 27:51.260* :  Professor Isabel Hook is from Lancaster University. We can see how good Euclid is going to be at
*27:51.260- 27:56.880* :  detecting distant galaxies and how good its image quality is. And everything's working. I mean,
*27:56.880- 28:01.200* :  that's pretty exciting in itself. So you know, it's really a huge breakthrough and we're really
*28:01.200- 28:06.640* :  pleased just to see these images, but to see how beautiful they are as well. It just adds the icing
*28:06.640- 28:11.420* :  on the cake, really. But it's not the aesthetic allure that astronomers are most interested in.
*28:11.420- 28:17.380* :  Instead, they'll be scouring the images for the tiniest of distortions. They believe these could
*28:17.380- 28:23.200* :  be subtle signals of two mysterious phenomena. Dark matter, a ghost-like substance, and dark
*28:23.200- 28:28.840* :  energy, a force that's causing the universe to expand at an ever faster rate. They're thought
*28:28.840- 28:33.840* :  to make up most of the cosmos, but no one has ever seen them, or really knows what they are.
*28:34.880- 28:39.360* :  Now back to our top story, Israel has been holding a day of memorial events to mark the
*28:39.360- 28:44.800* :  Hamas attacks in the south of the country exactly a month ago. They killed more than 1,400 people.
*28:45.240- 28:51.440* :  Flags were flown at half-mast and minute silence was held. The youngest son of the shy family
*28:51.440- 28:56.820* :  Yoron was in Israeli soldier on duty in the closest community to the Gaza Strip, which is called
*28:56.820- 29:03.000* :  Keram Shalom. He was killed on the 7th of October. We spoke to one of his brothers of fear a week later.
*29:03.700- 29:11.620* :  My baby brother died a hero under terrible tragic circumstances, but my brother was one of the
*29:11.620- 29:19.360* :  happiest kids I've ever met. He was hilarious. He was a clown. He had charm. He was a beautiful boy.
*29:19.920- 29:25.300* :  He always had people surrounding him. Everybody loved him. He was the light in every single room.
*29:26.080- 29:31.820* :  He would stay quiet for what seemed like an entire conversation. You'd think to yourself, is he
*29:31.820- 29:36.480* :  zooming out? Is he, you know, trying to see the bigger picture? Or is he just not understanding
*29:36.480- 29:40.940* :  anything that's going on around him? And then he would just come out with the funniest
*29:40.940- 29:46.980* :  remark that lets you know he was listening. He was here this entire time. And he had this sort of
*29:47.660- 29:53.920* :  sarcastic wit. My colleague James Menendez caught up with a fear on Tuesday and began by asking
*29:53.920- 30:00.740* :  how he and his family are coping one month on. I think we we all have been better. It looks online
*30:00.740- 30:06.440* :  like some sort of trander or something nice to post about with some nice hashtags, but it's been
*30:06.440- 30:12.980* :  a nightmare of a reality for us living through the last 30 days or so. And how have your emotions
*30:12.980- 30:20.400* :  changed over that time, do you think? I think over time a lot of the pain becomes mixed with a
*30:20.400- 30:28.620* :  lot of gray pride in what my brother did. He sacrificed his body and soul for the citizens of the
*30:28.620- 30:35.060* :  state of Israel protecting them from the atrocities we've seen in other parts of the areas surrounding
*30:35.060- 30:40.840* :  the Gaza Strip. And I know that my brother saved hundreds if not thousands of civilians from that
*30:40.840- 30:47.640* :  same exact reality. So I have a lot of pride in what he did. So you still see him as a hero?
*30:48.340- 30:54.520* :  I think he's a hero and you know he was always my hero. I think he's a national hero. I think he's
*30:54.540- 31:01.680* :  honestly humanity's hero for what he did and know the battle he stood for. The battle for the
*31:01.680- 31:08.960* :  good side of humanity, the battle for protecting innocent civilian lives. That's what my brother
*31:08.960- 31:15.700* :  died for. Can I ask you this? Have you had moments at all of feeling angry that this happened
*31:15.700- 31:22.060* :  at all? I mean, the attacks of October the 7th and the intelligence failures that went with it?
*31:22.400- 31:28.960* :  100% super, super anger. I know I don't represent just myself on this that there's a lot of people
*31:28.960- 31:34.360* :  who share the same exact anger and a lot of anger towards the terrorists who, you know, the
*31:34.360- 31:41.560* :  absolute animals of human beings that were capable of doing something like this. So terribly angry.
*31:42.400- 31:45.760* :  And anger towards the government, the Israeli government as well?
*31:46.280- 31:52.160* :  I'm not super happy with them. I think we could have done better, especially knowing, you know,
*31:52.500- 31:58.800* :  the Nazi ideology, that Hamas and the people on the other side of the fence hold.
*31:59.440- 32:04.240* :  And what about the response since those terrible events of October the 7th? How do you
*32:04.240- 32:08.300* :  feel about what's happened in the, well, just over four weeks since then?
*32:08.620- 32:14.940* :  I think people have been calling for a ceasefire. On October 6th, there was a ceasefire that was
*32:14.940- 32:21.760* :  completely broken and, you know, the worst way possible on October 7th. And if you ask me,
*32:21.760- 32:28.680* :  I am a loving person. I have nothing but peace in my mind. But until every single one of our
*32:28.680- 32:33.620* :  children, women, elderly and men come back from Gaza, there's nothing to talk about.
*32:33.620- 32:39.140* :  I think Israel has every single right to defend itself, do everything in its power to bring back
*32:39.140- 32:44.820* :  our people, bring back our civilians, being back, you know, everybody who is currently held captive
*32:44.820- 32:50.640* :  in Gaza back home. Right. So about getting those hostages back. And do you think that the way
*32:50.640- 32:57.480* :  that the operation has been conducted makes it more or less likely that they will all be able to
*32:57.480- 33:05.660* :  return alive? Listen, I'm not a general nor am I a politician. So I really am not the right
*33:05.660- 33:11.600* :  person to answer that question. All I know is my brothers and sisters are being held captive
*33:12.280- 33:18.560* :  under Islamic geodist rule. And I just want them back. And everything needs to be done to get
*33:18.560- 33:24.700* :  them back. What about the wider purpose of the operation? And I take what you say about not being
*33:24.700- 33:30.740* :  a soldier. But you talked about having peace in your soul and clearly no one wants anything
*33:30.740- 33:34.820* :  like this to happen again in the future. Do you think the operation will achieve that that it will
*33:34.820- 33:41.780* :  make Israelis feel safe again? I really hope to be safe again in my land. I really hope to raise my
*33:41.780- 33:47.960* :  children in a safe Western democratic state. And I want them to be raised on liberal values of
*33:47.960- 33:55.820* :  equality and justice. But for that to happen, we need to get rid of organizations like Hamas and
*33:55.820- 34:02.060* :  every other extreme fascist ideology in this region. And that was off your shy whose brother was
*34:02.060- 34:08.820* :  killed in those Hamas attacks a month ago. And that's all from us for now. There would be a new
*34:08.820- 34:12.700* :  addition of global news to download later. If you'd like to comment on this edition,
