*00:32.360- 00:40.340* :  World Service. I'm Andrew Pageant at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 2nd of November. These are our
*00:40.340- 00:45.780* :  main stories. Crowds of Palestinians have again gathered at Gaza's Raffa Crossing, hoping to be
*00:45.780- 00:51.900* :  allowed into Egypt. Cairo says it'll help evacuate 7,000 foreigners from 60 different countries.
*00:52.600- 00:56.180* :  There's been more fighting in the territory overnight and into this morning with the Israeli
*00:56.180- 01:01.420* :  military reporting further games. And flags have been flown at half-master across China
*01:01.880- 01:04.600* :  as the country laid its former Premier Lika Chang to rest.
*01:07.560- 01:11.340* :  Also in this podcast an Australian woman who served a beef Wellington dish,
*01:11.340- 01:15.180* :  suspected of containing poisonous mushrooms, has been charged with murder.
*01:15.800- 01:17.860* :  There's new music from the Beatles andâ€¦
*01:25.740- 01:30.540* :  Now after decades in the business, the Rolling Stones are also still making music history.
*01:34.200- 01:39.240* :  Our forces are at the gates of Gaza City. That's the assessment of the Israeli defence forces who
*01:39.240- 01:43.860* :  say they're broken through defensive lines in Gaza and killed a number of Hamas fighters.
*01:44.540- 01:48.780* :  BBC News understands there have been five separate battles taking place in northern Gaza
*01:49.180- 01:53.440* :  with the biggest in the northwest, although we can't independently verify that. Lieutenant
*01:53.440- 01:56.900* :  Colonel Peter Lerner is a spokesperson for the Israeli Defence Force.
*01:57.500- 02:01.360* :  Our ground efforts and I won't go into specifics for operational security concerns,
*02:01.360- 02:08.260* :  obviously, is expanding extremely present on the field, on the ground at air and at sea.
*02:08.740- 02:13.060* :  And we are determined to destroy Hamas' capability to make sure they can never ever
*02:13.460- 02:16.380* :  utilise the Gaza Strip and govern the Gaza Strip as a staging ground,
*02:16.380- 02:19.160* :  borrow the atrocities that they committed on September.
*02:20.520- 02:25.520* :  But Israeli troop deaths are also mounting, the number of soldiers killed has risen to 17.
*02:25.660- 02:29.900* :  Our Middle East correspondent, Yolen Nell, is following developments from Jerusalem.
*02:30.480- 02:34.480* :  According to colleagues on the ground, they're looking at five different battles in the Gaza
*02:34.480- 02:40.560* :  Strip right now between Israel and Hamas fighters, mainly in the north and also closer to Gaza City.
*02:41.060- 02:44.400* :  The biggest is in the northwest of the Strip where not so many people
*02:44.400- 02:49.640* :  remain the houses there have been badly destroyed up to now, so most people there have moved to
*02:49.640- 02:54.840* :  the south. And you've got videos that are coming out from both sides where you've got the Israeli
*02:54.840- 02:59.880* :  tanks and forces advancing being shown by the Israeli military. And you've got Hamas also
*02:59.880- 03:04.560* :  releasing its own videos to show how their fighters are emerging from tunnels. They're using
*03:04.560- 03:09.860* :  anti-tank missiles. They're engaging in gun battles with the Israeli soldiers.
*03:10.400- 03:15.480* :  Around Gaza City, this is where an Israeli commander said that now ground troops are at the gates
*03:15.480- 03:21.980* :  of Gaza City, speaking metaphorically, but there were some very heavy bombardments there overnight,
*03:22.060- 03:26.620* :  people saying they could hear a constant sound of shelling, that there was a lot of bombardment
*03:26.620- 03:31.560* :  around the two hospitals, Al-Quds Hospital and Shifa Hospital that have been so much
*03:31.560- 03:36.040* :  focus of attention in recent days, because of course people have been sheltering there.
*03:36.040- 03:40.380* :  There are many patients being treated there that the UN has said it would be impossible to move
*03:40.380- 03:45.120* :  for their safety. From the point of view of the Israeli defence force, this appears to be going
*03:45.120- 03:50.020* :  to plan. They wanted people to move from northern Gaza to the south. A lot of people have
*03:50.020- 03:56.120* :  heated those warnings enabling Israel to go into northern Gaza where only Hamas fighters remain
*03:56.120- 04:00.480* :  or at least there are many fewer people than would normally be there. Yeah, I mean the very north
*04:00.480- 04:06.280* :  of the Gaza Strip is less densely populated anyway. I think the real focus of their attention
*04:06.280- 04:12.660* :  Gaza City where we can see that tanks have approached from maybe at least three different points.
*04:12.660- 04:18.120* :  That is still a very different offensive that's going to have to be conducted there. It's going
*04:18.120- 04:22.380* :  to be very dangerous for Israeli forces going in on the ground. They may have to go building to
*04:22.380- 04:27.040* :  building as much as there has been this intense aerial bombardment. And when I've spoken to Palestinians
*04:27.040- 04:32.620* :  who are still sheltering in hospitals, in churches, in different buildings where they
*04:32.620- 04:36.820* :  felt that they would be safe, they are now very frightened to move. They say they've heard
*04:36.820- 04:42.760* :  in the past of others moving to the south and not being safe. We're hearing just in the past
*04:42.760- 04:48.280* :  couple of hours of another big strike by Israel on Albertish camp which is to the south of the Wadi
*04:48.280- 04:53.440* :  Gaza line which is where the Israeli military told people to move to. And with so many tanks and
*04:53.440- 04:59.020* :  ground forces now in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, that does make it feel much more difficult
*04:59.020- 05:04.080* :  for people to kind of move away to have safe routes. So maybe that does mean that this idea
*05:04.080- 05:10.000* :  of a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas both to create some space for talks on hostages
*05:10.000- 05:16.140* :  to be released than more than 240 hostages being held by Hamas. And for people to perhaps leave
*05:16.140- 05:21.280* :  to get to a safer place, perhaps that will gain some traction. Yola now in Jerusalem.
*05:21.960- 05:26.460* :  Evacuaries from the fighting, both foreign passport holders and injured Palestinians, have
*05:26.500- 05:31.620* :  continued to arrive in Egypt through the RAFA crossing. 400 people crossed yesterday, a similar
*05:31.620- 05:36.400* :  number of people expected to make the journey by the end of today. The list of those eligible
*05:36.400- 05:42.620* :  was worked out in Cairo, but Israel can vet names if it has security concerns. The spokesman
*05:42.620- 05:46.500* :  for the World Health Organization, Christian Linmeier, told the BBC the number of people
*05:46.500- 05:52.700* :  getting out was too small. It's an extremely small number out of the 2.4 million in the population,
*05:52.840- 05:58.720* :  and we don't have exact figures on the occupancy, but we know that each hospital is over capacity,
*05:58.720- 06:05.360* :  over 170, 180 percent capacity, which means there are at least two people per bed. It's an
*06:05.360- 06:10.720* :  unbearable situation, and the little bit of support we're getting is, of course, badly needed,
*06:11.180- 06:15.520* :  but way, way, way too little. Our Gaza correspondent, Rusty Abel Alouf,
*06:15.520- 06:21.180* :  is monitoring developments from the city of Colin Unis in southern Gaza. About 200 more people
*06:21.180- 06:27.380* :  managed to cross this morning and about 20 or so injured people. The process seems to be
*06:27.380- 06:32.600* :  the slow, not what the Palestinians here and the medical official here want. They said about
*06:32.860- 06:39.240* :  30,000 people, half of them are kids are in real need for medical treatment, but the number of
*06:39.240- 06:44.500* :  people allowed in is very small, but we understand that Egypt will keep the rough crossing border
*06:44.500- 06:50.140* :  until they evacuate 7,000 people, and a big number of people injured because they are building
*06:50.140- 06:55.260* :  hospital outside the border. So the process is working but slowly, but I have to say in the last
*06:55.460- 07:00.720* :  half an hour or so, there was a deadly airstrike in the so-called safe area. It's in El Burej,
*07:00.720- 07:06.160* :  Refugee Camp, about 10 kilometers from here where 15 people killed and about 50 people are missing
*07:06.160- 07:10.860* :  under the rubble of these buildings and most of them are displaced from Gaza City.
*07:11.380- 07:16.940* :  Our Gaza correspondent, Rusty Abel Alouf. An Australian woman has been charged with murder after
*07:16.940- 07:22.240* :  the deaths of three people by suspected mushroom poisoning. Erin Patterson's alleged victims
*07:22.240- 07:27.000* :  died after eating a family lunch. She served them at her home. A dish thought to have contained
*07:27.000- 07:31.160* :  death cap mushrooms. Our reporter, Courtney Bembridge, has been telling my colleague,
*07:31.160- 07:35.840* :  Marion Machiri, more about the case. This is all centered around a lunch that Erin Patterson
*07:35.840- 07:41.140* :  hosted in late July. Beef Wellington was on the menu, and she had invited her ex-husband at the
*07:41.140- 07:46.940* :  last minute he cancelled, but his parents Gail and Don did attend and sadly after that a few days
*07:46.940- 07:52.460* :  later they died. Also in attendance was Gail's sister Heather and her husband Ian. Now he
*07:52.460- 07:58.060* :  somehow survived. He was the only one who survived and he was treated in hospital for about two
*07:58.060- 08:03.400* :  months. He has now been released, but he was critically ill. Now Heather Patterson says she was
*08:03.400- 08:08.860* :  also taken to hospital and that she also had to be treated after eating the meal and she's always
*08:08.860- 08:14.940* :  maintained her innocence. She also spoke at the time to media about where she had got the mushrooms,
*08:14.940- 08:19.620* :  so she said that she bought some fresh mushrooms from a supermarket and some dried mushrooms
*08:19.620- 08:25.520* :  from an Asian grocery store. But police believed that this was a death cap mushroom that death
*08:25.520- 08:30.160* :  cap mushrooms were involved in this case. Usually they are grown in the area, but they are the dead
*08:30.160- 08:35.340* : liest mushroom known to humans. So it's unclear where they had come from, but she did speak to media
*08:35.340- 08:39.740* :  at the time and we can actually hear a little snippet of what she told reporters. I've never stayed.
*08:40.180- 08:44.900* :  I love them. Short clip there, Courtney, but you can very much get the feeling, can't you, that
*08:44.900- 08:49.340* :  she is devastated. Let me ask you what's happened today. She's been arrested for murder. Yes,
*08:49.340- 08:53.680* :  she was arrested early this morning and police have been searching her house throughout the day.
*08:53.680- 08:59.860* :  She has now been charged. So there are three murder charges that she is facing and also five
*08:59.860- 09:04.660* :  attempted murder charges. And that's interesting because some of them relate to incidents that
*09:04.660- 09:09.500* :  aren't related to this particular lunch in July of this year. Oh. And they are involving a man who
*09:09.500- 09:15.440* :  fell ill after eating other meals and it's believed that that may be her ex-husband. So there were
*09:15.440- 09:19.840* :  five counts total of attempted murder. One of those, of course, involves Ian who we heard about
*09:19.840- 09:24.180* :  earlier, who was in hospital, but it's believed that three of those counts relate to previous
*09:24.180- 09:29.380* :  incidents which potentially involve her ex-husband. All police have said it was a 48-year-old man.
*09:29.980- 09:33.880* :  Australia must be absolutely gripped by it. What's been going on now? What's the reaction meant to
*09:33.880- 09:37.640* :  that? Yeah, it's been closely followed around the country. Deathcap mushrooms are available in
*09:37.640- 09:41.440* :  other parts of the world too and there were, of course, warnings about people not foraging them,
*09:41.440- 09:44.860* :  but it does sound like as we're getting more information about this case that there's more at play.
*09:44.860- 09:50.800* :  Police have also said that they found a food dehydrator at a local tip. Now, Aaron Patterson said
*09:50.800- 09:55.900* :  that was mine. I dumped it there in a fit of panic. Police have also been at the property today
*09:55.900- 10:01.320* :  with sniffer dogs that especially trained looking for technology. So laptops, SIM cards, phones. So
*10:01.620- 10:06.640* :  a lot of different strands to this investigation. Courtney Bembridge, our brain powered
*10:06.640- 10:12.760* :  client during COVID, whether or not we contracted the virus. That's the conclusion of a new study
*10:12.760- 10:18.800* :  in the UK. The research compared the brain health of thousands of volunteers aged between 50 and 90
*10:18.800- 10:25.880* :  between early 2019 and early 2020 with the two years that followed. Dementia Professor and Corbett
*10:25.880- 10:31.240* :  from the University of Exeter led the research, which is part of an ongoing study. We see a natural
*10:31.240- 10:35.760* :  decline in people over time as they age. That's a normal process and we see that in the cohort
*10:35.760- 10:41.820* :  that's been running for nine years anyway. But when we look at the data from March 2020 onwards,
*10:41.820- 10:46.100* :  what we see is an acceleration of that decline. So in the first year of the pandemic,
*10:46.100- 10:52.460* :  we saw a 50% increase rate in that decline and that actually continued into the second year,
*10:52.920- 10:56.560* :  even though those lockdowns and social restrictions were being lifted. And that's what we're
*10:56.560- 11:01.220* :  particularly concerned about. Obviously, there was a very unusual time in all our lives. So many
*11:01.220- 11:07.020* :  factors that could be driving this, but it does appear to be a very clear change as we went into
*11:07.020- 11:12.660* :  the pandemic that is causing something in this cognitive decline. So when we looked more closely
*11:12.660- 11:18.820* :  our data, we considered whether any of the known factors that drive brain health might be a play
*11:18.820- 11:23.540* :  here. And what we did see was that certain factors that we also know changed during the pandemic
*11:24.040- 11:28.420* :  were driving some of this change. And those included things like people doing less physical
*11:28.420- 11:34.300* :  activity, people drinking a bit more alcohol, people experiencing higher levels of depression,
*11:34.920- 11:39.020* :  and also people reporting being more lonely. And I think we can all see that that really
*11:39.020- 11:44.740* :  chimes with a lot of our experiences of being in lockdown. These are very subtle changes,
*11:44.740- 11:49.940* :  the brain changes very slowly over time. And there are things that we can do to improve our brain
*11:49.940- 11:54.560* :  health, to protect our brains against the risk of dementia and other conditions. And I think
*11:54.560- 11:59.180* :  that really is the important message here is that whilst there clearly has been an impact
*11:59.180- 12:04.140* :  of the pandemic on brain health, there are things that people can do to help to
*12:04.140- 12:10.340* :  stave off any further change. The best way of reducing your risk of dementia is to do more physical
*12:10.340- 12:15.640* :  activity, also to maintain a healthy weight. So these are quite familiar, lifestyle and behaviour
*12:15.640- 12:22.260* :  factors. Professor of dementia research and Corbit. More than 50 years after the Beatles last
*12:22.260- 12:27.560* :  album, the band is releasing a new song today, their last one, according to support McCartney.
*12:27.880- 12:33.080* :  It's called Now and Then. It's based on a scratchy recording demo left behind by John Lennon,
*12:33.380- 12:38.740* :  enhanced and added to by the surviving Beatles. It even features a contribution by the late George
*12:38.740- 12:43.760* :  Harrison. Now for rights reasons, we can't play you the song here, but a short film about
*12:43.760- 12:49.800* :  its production now and then the last Beatles song was released in advance. When we lost John,
*12:49.920- 12:56.160* :  we knew that it was really over. I was talking to Yoko and she said, I think I've got a tape
*12:56.160- 13:01.620* :  of John. All called me up and said you'd like to work on now and then. He put the bass on,
*13:01.660- 13:07.820* :  I put the drums on. It's the last song that my dad and Paul and George and Ringo will get to
*13:07.820- 13:16.320* :  make together. How lucky was I to have those men in my life? All of Amaru's films director and writer,
*13:16.320- 13:23.000* :  he's been speaking to Amal Rajan. In the 70s, John was living in New York and as people know,
*13:23.020- 13:28.700* :  he'd kind of stepped away from show business, but that didn't mean that he'd stepped away from
*13:28.940- 13:35.400* :  songwriting. He just wasn't really telling anyone about it and so he would write in the decoder
*13:35.400- 13:41.880* :  building where he lived on tapes, you know, just for him, just like I sort of audio notebook and
*13:42.840- 13:48.580* :  sadly that's where they remained for years and years and years. They were never supposed to be
*13:48.580- 13:54.360* :  commercially released and so it took a really interesting team of people to kind of set to and
*13:54.360- 14:01.540* :  extract his voice from this ropey audio tape and that team was led to a large degree by Peter Jackson,
*14:01.540- 14:05.600* :  the legendary director, the guy behind the Lord of the Rings and also behind Get Back, that
*14:05.920- 14:10.680* :  monumental series about the Beatles and he got excited about artificial intelligence. What was
*14:10.680- 14:18.320* :  that able to do that mere humanity could not? So the technology that was used to extract John
*14:18.320- 14:24.280* :  from the tape is called machine audio learning. In a nutshell, you put in enough data into a
*14:24.280- 14:31.560* :  computer so that it can learn what John's voice should sound like and so you're kind of able to
*14:31.560- 14:39.040* :  peel away all these layers of the sonic dirt if you like. I think of it as like musical archaeology,
*14:39.040- 14:44.280* :  John was in there but just buried under all of this stuff and what you're able to do with amazing
*14:44.280- 14:51.040* :  fidelity is peel away these layers and brush away all the frequencies that you don't want but then
*14:51.040- 14:56.320* :  also in that process you're going to lose quite a lot of stuff and historically that's always been
*14:56.560- 15:03.980* :  the problem. We all know what a tinny replica of a song sounds like a bad copy and second third
*15:03.980- 15:10.340* :  generation copies. What this technology is able to do is take away the stuff you don't want but then
*15:10.340- 15:18.960* :  really carefully put back the stuff that you do want and what that gives you is John's pure voice.
*15:19.800- 15:28.280* :  The film director Oliver Murray. Still to come? My request is that our
*15:28.280- 15:35.620* :  youngsters must say this is my country. I want to work 70 hours a week. One of India's richest
*15:35.620- 15:40.680* :  businessmen is criticised after appealing for young professionals to work harder and longer.
*15:48.740- 15:54.080* :  In China the funeral has taken place of the popular reformist politician Lika Chang who died suddenly
*15:54.080- 16:00.020* :  at the age of 68 just months after leaving his post as premier. Video showed President Xi Jinping
*16:00.020- 16:05.460* :  and other senior party members visiting to pay their respects to the open casket draped in a
*16:05.460- 16:10.880* :  hammer and sickle flag. In Lee's hometown of Kafei there was tight security around crowds of
*16:10.880- 16:16.720* :  mourners who gathered to lay flowers outside his childhood home. Our China correspondent Steve McDonnell
*16:16.720- 16:24.320* :  is there. A local official tried to whip a small crowd of communist party volunteers into an
*16:24.340- 16:30.620* :  anti-media frenzy calling on them to drive journalists away from the street where Lika Chang grew up.
*16:31.540- 16:35.720* :  Following his sudden death last week mourners in their thousands have been gathering in
*16:35.720- 16:41.380* :  her face Hong Xin road, feeling footpaths with so many flowers they're now at head height.
*16:42.240- 16:46.660* :  But on the day of his memorial service reporting on this remembrance has been blocked.
*16:48.680- 16:54.320* :  Television coverage of Lika Chang's funeral wasn't live and the service itself a rather modest
*16:54.320- 17:00.800* :  affair. Even in death he's posing a challenge to Xi Jinping. China's former number two,
*17:01.280- 17:05.340* :  who was seen as more moderate, had been sidelined in Mr Xi's administration.
*17:06.260- 17:11.240* :  His death has led many to ask what the country would have been like had this economist in favor of
*17:11.260- 17:17.440* :  compromise been selected as paramount leader instead of the more ideologically hard line Xi Jinping.
*17:18.640- 17:24.020* :  The death of popular leaders can lead to upheaval in China so President Xi will be hoping
*17:24.060- 17:32.160* :  the moment passes quickly. New research suggests that many of the drugs used to treat childhood
*17:32.160- 17:37.680* :  diseases have less than 50 percent effectiveness. In the most seriously affected regions in
*17:37.680- 17:42.380* :  Southeast Asia this means that thousands of children are dying from diseases like pneumonia,
*17:42.380- 17:47.800* :  blood infections and meningitis because of increasing antibiotic resistance which makes these
*17:47.800- 17:52.720* :  drugs less effective. And the study says world health organization guidelines are becoming
*17:52.720- 17:58.200* :  outdated and in need of revision as this problem increases. Devina Gupta spoke to the studies
*17:58.200- 18:02.720* :  lead author Dr Phoebe Williams from the University of Sydney, School of Public Health.
*18:03.300- 18:07.920* :  The antibiotic resistance is something that has been around since antibiotics were first discovered
*18:07.920- 18:12.300* :  a hundred years ago. You know no sooner than we discover a class of antibiotics do we see
*18:12.540- 18:16.320* :  overuse both in human health as well as in agriculture and veterinary medicine.
*18:16.920- 18:21.960* :  And quickly these bacteria then develop resistance to our first and second line agents that will
*18:21.960- 18:27.340* :  often use to treat infections. The challenge now is that antimicrobial or antibiotic resistance
*18:27.340- 18:32.280* :  is excelling at such a fast pace that we're unfortunately not keeping up with development at
*18:32.280- 18:38.200* :  the same pace and soon these bacteria might become untreatable. Our study focused on Southeast Asia
*18:38.240- 18:41.940* :  but there's actually been a couple of big studies in the last few years that have shown that
*18:41.940- 18:47.860* :  sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are also significantly affected but really antibiotic
*18:48.300- 18:51.820* :  resistance is a challenge for all healthcare settings that it's occurring in every country
*18:51.820- 18:56.580* :  across the world as well as high-income countries. So it's not something that's just confined
*18:56.580- 19:02.320* :  to resource constrained parts of the world. But is it also related to the way antibiotics are
*19:02.320- 19:07.420* :  consumed in some of these countries? I'm from India and I do know you don't need a doctor's prescription
*19:07.420- 19:12.260* :  to buy antibiotics. They're easily available over the count at any farmer shops and they're often
*19:12.260- 19:17.620* :  given to adults and children even for common cold and cough. Yeah you're exactly right. So
*19:17.620- 19:22.020* :  one of the challenges that drives antibiotic resistance is overuse of antibiotics.
*19:22.540- 19:26.900* :  It's a fine balance though because in many of these settings some children might not be able to
*19:26.900- 19:32.200* :  access a hospital or a doctor and so having community pharmacies that can give a child a
*19:32.200- 19:38.240* :  course of a moxacillin when they have pneumonia could be a life-saving thing. So overuse is one
*19:38.300- 19:42.900* :  thing but also in many of these settings we are seeing many many more babies now delivering in
*19:42.900- 19:49.180* :  healthcare facilities and we often will then see overcrowded healthcare facilities and many of
*19:49.180- 19:54.420* :  these healthcare workers are being coached by high-income countries and so there might be settings
*19:54.420- 19:59.760* :  where you see 20 babies on a ward that's meant to only house 8 or 10 babies and one nurse with
*19:59.760- 20:04.860* :  very little time to wash their hands between all those babies and so it's a combination of many
*20:04.860- 20:10.280* :  factors that sees it driven in these countries. Consultant pediatrician Dr Phoebe Williams.
*20:11.200- 20:16.060* :  Lawyers in the fraud trial of the former U.S. CryptoBoss, same-bankment freed have been making
*20:16.060- 20:21.460* :  their closing arguments. The 31-year-old is accused of charges tied to the collapse of the now
*20:21.460- 20:27.520* :  bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. He denies the charges. Our New York business correspondent
*20:27.520- 20:32.560* :  Erin Delmore has been following proceedings in the New York courtroom. We saw the prosecution go
*20:32.560- 20:38.640* :  first talking about Mr. Bankman freed and saying that he built a pyramid of deceit that was their
*20:38.640- 20:45.140* :  quote based on lies and false promises. They were weaving in the evidence, the testimony, the documents,
*20:45.140- 20:51.020* :  the spreadsheets, the company policies, the tweets to build their case and show that Mr. Bankman
*20:51.020- 20:57.620* :  freed as they say stole FTX customer funds and used them to fund not only his hedge fund
*20:57.620- 21:03.020* :  Alameda research but also to fund a lavish lifestyle. The defense say that their client Mr. Bankman
*21:03.020- 21:09.400* :  freed made mistakes but acted in good faith and saying he made mistakes but he didn't commit crimes.
*21:09.400- 21:14.840* :  Now they point to a lack of sufficient risk management at FTX that's a big thing that they've
*21:14.840- 21:20.080* :  been talking about here and their narrative stands in contrast to the prosecutions. Now Mr. Bankman
*21:20.080- 21:25.040* :  freed has denied these charges. He's pleaded not guilty but something that the prosecution has on
*21:25.040- 21:31.360* :  its side is the cooperating witnesses. These three key witnesses who worked and lived alongside Mr. Bankman
*21:31.360- 21:36.380* :  freed who pleaded guilty and testified and worked with the prosecution here and presented their
*21:36.380- 21:41.080* :  version of events in front of the jury. So we see a stark contrast with the defense holding up Mr.
*21:41.080- 21:45.880* :  Bankman freed's narrative that he wasn't a key decision maker found out about happenings
*21:45.880- 21:50.900* :  at the company later than his former colleagues have said he did and the prosecution saying you
*21:50.900- 21:54.700* :  can't believe both at the same time. If you believe these witnesses we've put on the stand,
*21:54.700- 21:57.820* :  then you'll find Mr. Bankman freed's testimony inconsistent.
*21:58.560- 22:02.680* :  For more in-scient Vivian Nunes spoke to Michael Lewis who's written a book about
*22:02.680- 22:07.860* :  Sandbankman freed. The characters and the trial are all characters from my book so I know all
*22:07.860- 22:11.860* :  these people. I mean it isn't just Sandbankman freed. I've interviewed some of these people 20 times
*22:11.860- 22:17.620* :  back before they thought they had any trouble at all so it's just bizarre to see them on display
*22:17.620- 22:21.800* :  in this way. So if you think about what happens in a trial it's kind of a story war. You've got
*22:21.800- 22:25.100* :  the defense lawyers and you've got the lawyers for the prosecution and they're both spinning
*22:25.180- 22:30.680* :  tails and they're both selecting facts and both their stories are unbelievably distorted. They
*22:30.680- 22:35.900* :  bear very little relation to anybody who was watching it kind of experienced some but not complete.
*22:36.120- 22:40.280* :  You first came across Sandbankman freed when a friend asked you whether he should close a deal with
*22:40.280- 22:46.360* :  him and invest hundreds of millions of dollars. At that time you said go for it. At what point did
*22:46.360- 22:51.040* :  you realize that that maybe wasn't such a great idea and did you advise them to take the money out?
*22:51.140- 22:55.940* :  It wasn't just my advice he was following. He obviously had his own views about what he wanted to do.
*22:56.260- 23:02.440* :  It was $300 million. He did it. I did tell him what could go wrong. That no point until it
*23:02.440- 23:08.640* :  unraveled. November of last year did either he or I thought that he was at much risk because the
*23:08.860- 23:13.080* :  exchange looked like it was completely separate from Sandbankman freed's trading firm and it was
*23:13.080- 23:17.700* :  a trading firm that brought it down and the exchange was even when crypto was falling off a cliff.
*23:17.700- 23:22.860* :  Even when Bitcoin prices went from 60,000 to 20,000 the exchange was still doing pretty good
*23:22.860- 23:27.280* :  business. It was on track to make $400 million last year and that's what he owned a piece of.
*23:27.820- 23:32.020* :  Even further than that none of the employees saw it coming. I mean the employees had all their
*23:32.020- 23:36.740* :  wealth on this thing. And that is incredible since so much of their lives were built around calculating
*23:36.740- 23:41.360* :  probabilities. How did they not see the probability of failure coming up on the horizon?
*23:41.720- 23:47.220* :  It's a really good question why no one was able to detect what happened but part of the story,
*23:47.220- 23:53.580* :  a big part of the story is that from the point of view of even most of its employees the company
*23:53.580- 23:58.060* :  was a black box that the regulators didn't have insight into it. There were no grown-ups on the
*23:58.060- 24:03.780* :  premises. Funny what the story is, it's a story partly about how hard it is to see what's going
*24:03.780- 24:07.860* :  on when what's going on is going on inside of a computer. What attracted you to writing this story
*24:07.860- 24:12.280* :  in the first place then? Was it Sandbankman freed himself because he is such a fascinating
*24:12.280- 24:16.360* :  character or wasn't that he wanted to tell the hidden story of the crypto world?
*24:16.640- 24:20.820* :  It was a combination of things. I didn't know what I was going to write when I started to hang
*24:20.820- 24:25.640* :  around with them. I just said I want to watch. I want to see if there's a story here. He was clearly
*24:25.640- 24:30.480* :  a character of literary dimensions. If a novelist made him up people would think it was spectacular.
*24:30.480- 24:35.880* :  He worked that well as a character. It was as much a situation he was in that he'd gone from
*24:36.120- 24:39.980* :  having no money to having 22 and a half billion dollars in about 18 months. He was the richest
*24:39.980- 24:45.900* :  person in the world under 30. He was not quiet about it and was pretty intent on doing lots of
*24:45.900- 24:49.780* :  stuff with his money including putting a billion dollars into US presidential elections
*24:50.320- 24:55.720* :  and giving it away in all kinds of unusual ways. So it was a very disruptive 22 and a half billion
*24:55.720- 25:01.520* :  dollars plus the world has now gotten used to these quick fortunes happening and it now
*25:01.520- 25:06.480* :  organizes itself around the money. And so it was as much about what he was telling us about the
*25:06.480- 25:12.880* :  world as it was about him. The US author Michael Lewis. One of the richest men in India has
*25:12.880- 25:18.520* :  sparked debate in his home country with his call in a podcast for young Indian professionals to
*25:18.520- 25:24.480* :  work harder and longer. Noreana Morty appeal to work as national pride to boost productivity.
*25:24.540- 25:30.200* :  Mr. Morty who just happens to be the father-in-law of the UK Prime Minister Rishisunak was speaking
*25:30.200- 25:36.200* :  on 314 capitals the record. India's work productivity is one of the lowest in the world.
*25:36.320- 25:45.220* :  My request is that our anxious must say this is my country. I want to work 70 hours a week.
*25:45.480- 25:49.660* :  You know this is exactly what Germans and Japanese did after the second world war.
*25:50.240- 25:54.940* :  So what reaction has the been from young people? Reach operate is a freelance writer in Delhi.
*25:55.440- 26:01.300* :  Not in the 90s and the 2000s anymore where putting in a few extra hours of work a day could
*26:01.300- 26:07.160* :  actually contribute to a huge jump in salary. India's job market is trained. The amount of
*26:07.520- 26:12.340* :  opportunities available to people are very very less. I mean our wage gap is ever-increasing.
*26:12.340- 26:18.220* :  So any extra work that people put in doesn't go into their own pockets but to the pockets of
*26:18.220- 26:24.480* :  Delhi who are getting even better off of our labour. Mr. Morty's comments of calls quite a
*26:24.480- 26:29.460* :  debate in India. Rahul Tandon has been getting the thoughts of Ruchi Gupta director of the future
*26:29.460- 26:35.940* :  of India Foundation. You know I think he came from a good place. He himself has clearly worked hard.
*26:35.940- 26:42.060* :  He's the founder of Infosys and so very successful tech company. Basically he was talking about
*26:42.060- 26:47.540* :  having a commitment to one's country and to that extent I'm fully on board with what he was
*26:47.540- 26:54.200* :  saying. However I think that sometimes there is a tendency to gloss over the challenges that
*26:54.200- 26:58.640* :  young people face. Especially if you rate four young person in India today.
*26:58.960- 27:04.340* :  One of the issues as well is when we're talking about people working 70 hours we have a lot of
*27:04.340- 27:09.520* :  people graduating in India. We have a lot of young people in India who don't have jobs. It's not
*27:09.520- 27:15.480* :  easy for them to be productive. It does exactly my point right. So for one report that recently came
*27:15.480- 27:22.520* :  out of the state of working India 40% of them graduate are unemployed. They later find jobs
*27:22.520- 27:27.540* :  over the course but what are the kind of jobs that we are providing for them? These are not jobs
*27:27.540- 27:33.040* :  as an inspire young people to be disciplined, to be able to put in their best because these are
*27:33.040- 27:38.660* :  not jobs that have a lot of growth prospects. They go occur jobs, delivery workers, taxi drivers,
*27:39.320- 27:44.740* :  even jobs that are ultimately not going to lead to any growth prospects for these young people.
*27:45.080- 27:51.140* :  So when they ask them to put in extra hours it can seem a little bit exploitable because
*27:51.140- 27:55.440* :  they're not really sharing the gains of growth that India is getting.
*27:55.780- 27:57.860* :  Richie Gupta from the Future of India Foundation.
*27:58.540- 28:02.120* :  Less than two weeks after the release of their latest album, Hackney Diamonds,
*28:02.340- 28:07.960* :  the Rolling Stones have set a new chart record in the United States. They become the first act to
*28:07.960- 28:14.440* :  reach the top 10 with new albums in every decade since the 1960s. Our reporter Guy Lambert has more
*28:23.620- 28:25.940* :  on their record-breaking release. From 12x5 in 1964
*28:32.300- 28:40.180* :  to Hackney Diamonds in 2023, the Stones are on a roll. For the 38th time a Rolling Stones album
*28:40.180- 28:45.480* :  has reached the top 10 in the United States. Hackney Diamonds has flown onto the Billboard chart
*28:45.480- 28:50.660* :  at number three this week, making the veteran band the first to have new albums reach the top 10
*28:50.660- 28:54.740* :  in the United States in every decade since the 1960s.
*29:02.120- 29:07.360* :  The album is the first collection of original songs since 2005 and the first without drummer Charlie
*29:07.420- 29:13.200* :  Watts. But it features contributions from Sir Elton John, Lady Gaga and Sir Paul McCartney.
*29:13.420- 29:18.120* :  The rock legends have also received a Brit billion award in recognition of being streamed more than
*29:18.120- 29:23.680* :  a billion times in the UK and it's not just the streaming world that the Stones have taken by storm.
*29:23.680- 29:27.800* :  Eager fans have been flocking to record shops to get their hands on a hard copy,
*29:28.160- 29:32.160* :  putting the album at the top of last week's UK official vinyl albums chart.
*29:32.680- 29:36.580* :  In the UK, the release has taken the group to number one for the 14th time.
*29:37.260- 29:41.780* :  Circliffe Richards still holds the record with top 10 albums across eight decades,
*29:42.400- 29:47.160* :  so despite this record breaking achievement in the US, the Rolling Stones will have to keep
*29:47.160- 29:52.900* :  making music for quite a while longer if they want to claim the UK crown. Although fans certainly
*30:08.740- 30:08.920* :  won't be complaining.
*30:08.920- 30:12.200* :  That's all from us for now. There will be a new edition of Global News to download later.
