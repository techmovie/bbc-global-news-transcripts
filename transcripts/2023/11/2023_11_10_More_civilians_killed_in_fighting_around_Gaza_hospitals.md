*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:16.760* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:19.200- 00:25.460* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 10th of November, these are our main stories.
*00:25.500- 00:31.060* :  The Hamass run health ministry in Gaza says that at least 13 people have been killed in Israeli
*00:31.060- 00:36.880* :  air strikes on the biggest hospital there. Israel accuses Hamass of hiding in tunnels under
*00:36.880- 00:44.200* :  healthcare facilities. In our attempt to defeat Hamass, we are forced to fight near hospitals to
*00:44.200- 00:51.500* :  deal with the very real terror machine that is Hamass. BBC has spoken to Palestinian children whose
*00:51.500- 00:57.180* :  futures will be forever changed by the war. Jewish communities in Germany express fears that the
*00:57.180- 01:06.320* :  Israel Gaza conflict is reigniting anti-Semitism. Also in this podcast, Surgeons at New York
*01:06.320- 01:17.860* :  University achieve the world's first eye transplant. And 35 years after her hit single fast car,
*01:18.280- 01:23.380* :  Tracy Chapman has become the first black woman to win a country music association award.
*01:27.060- 01:32.800* :  In Gaza, hospitals have come under attack from Israeli air strikes according to the Hamass run
*01:32.800- 01:38.540* :  health ministry. It also said that at least 13 people were killed and the court chart of the
*01:38.540- 01:44.780* :  biggest hospital in Gaza, Al Shifa was hit. Graphic video shared on social media and verified by
*01:44.780- 01:51.200* :  the Reuters news agency shows a number of dead and wounded. What you're about to hear is a young girl
*01:51.200- 02:03.580* :  screaming why, which she may find distressing. Israel's offensive follows the killing of more
*02:03.580- 02:10.700* :  than 1,400 people by Hamass and, say the Israeli, is the abduction of 240 hostages. Since then,
*02:10.700- 02:15.320* :  more than 11,000 people have been killed according to the health ministry in Gaza.
*02:15.700- 02:19.840* :  Muhammad Khada is one of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians.
*02:23.720- 02:28.760* :  I came back and didn't find a house. I didn't find a mother, a sister, in enough destruction.
*02:28.760- 02:34.400* :  There's nothing left. We need a ceasefire. A ceasefire to bring medicine or aid to the hospitals.
*02:34.460- 02:39.260* :  These hospitals are now full of displaced people. Not only the wounded and the dead,
*02:39.260- 02:44.960* :  it's a place for displaced people now. The Israeli military has said it regarded hospitals as
*02:44.960- 02:51.660* :  legitimate and legal targets if Hamass used the buildings as a base. Mark Regev is a senior advisor
*02:51.660- 02:57.860* :  to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamass has established its command and control,
*02:57.860- 03:04.920* :  its bunker system, underneath hospitals. This is well known. This is documented. And in our attempt
*03:04.920- 03:12.020* :  to defeat Hamass, we are forced to fight near hospitals to deal with the very real
*03:13.300- 03:20.560* :  terror machine that is Hamass. Our forces still differentiate, of course, between civilians and
*03:20.560- 03:27.340* :  between Hamass terrorists, the letter RRI enemy, and we have no intention of harming the former.
*03:28.220- 03:33.720* :  But the United Nations has said that the carnage simply must stop. I got the latest from our
*03:33.720- 03:40.320* :  correspondent in Gaza-Rishti Abu Alif. Very intense fighting around the four hospitals in Gaza
*03:40.320- 03:46.300* :  city, including the main hospital, which is the largest medical center in the entire of Gaza
*03:46.300- 03:51.380* :  Strip. It's called Chifa Hospital. We believe that tanks are surrounding the hospital. Very close
*03:51.380- 03:58.200* :  within 100 meters or so from the hospital. Still thousands of people who are taking the hospital
*03:58.200- 04:04.880* :  as a shelter since the beginning of the Israeli ground operation about two weeks ago. People
*04:04.880- 04:11.400* :  moved from the nearby beach camp to the hospital and taking a shelter. The hospital now is
*04:11.400- 04:17.340* :  treating hundreds of patients inside. Heavy fighting overnight, there was an elastric within the
*04:17.340- 04:23.480* :  courtyard of the hospital. Some people were injured and the health ministry run by Hamass. Some people
*04:23.480- 04:29.140* :  were killed inside the hospital. The second two hospitals are in farther north, called the
*04:29.640- 04:35.040* :  Rantisi Hospital and the Nasser Hospital. One of them is special hospital for the
*04:35.040- 04:41.180* :  cancer patients and the second one is for the patriotic hospital. And now the Israelis are calling
*04:41.180- 04:46.700* :  people by loudspeakers according to somebody in the hospital who told the BBC that they are calling
*04:46.700- 04:53.000* :  loudspeakers that everybody should leave the hospital except the medical staff and the patient
*04:53.000- 04:58.820* :  and all the civilians who are taking the other two hospitals. As shelters should leave, the fourth
*04:58.820- 05:05.300* :  hospital which in the south is called Al-Quds Hospital. It's in a telly el-Hawane Barhood where about
*05:05.300- 05:11.580* :  14,000 people are taking also the hospital as a shelter and the communication with the hospital
*05:11.580- 05:20.620* :  was down since yesterday but today the managed to send a message through the radio station to the
*05:20.620- 05:26.920* :  Hedicuarta and Hanyunis here and the BBC was the only immediate that was allowed to hear the message.
*05:26.920- 05:33.080* :  It was somebody from the hospital speaking saying he says that heavy fighting around the hospital
*05:33.080- 05:39.760* :  tanks surrounding the hospital. He said also some explosions. Israel has been telling people to
*05:39.760- 05:45.220* :  leave the northern part of the Gaza Strip for some time. You say it's now on loudspeakers telling
*05:45.220- 05:51.700* :  people to leave the hospitals. Why is anyone still there? Because the places in the south are
*05:51.700- 05:57.980* :  overwhelmed with hundreds of thousands of people. Here in Nasr Hospital where I am staying for the last
*05:58.200- 06:02.200* :  three weeks. People are sleeping on the ground, people are sleeping in the streets and there is no
*06:02.200- 06:08.400* :  food and there is no water and also Israel is targeting places in the south within the safe area.
*06:08.840- 06:13.800* :  So for the people who are inside the Gaza City they said many people I called them. They said
*06:13.800- 06:19.380* :  if they are hitting everywhere north, south, east and west why we have to leave our house as well.
*06:19.380- 06:25.600* :  From my point of view as somebody who was leaving Gaza City three weeks ago with my with my family
*06:26.120- 06:32.080* :  I can say that the southern part of Gaza is quieter than the focus of the Israeli
*06:32.080- 06:37.400* :  operation in the north. Well it's still airstrikes overnight. We still have drones flying day and
*06:37.400- 06:43.220* :  night over the Hanyunis area. We still have every day in the hospital people got killed and
*06:43.220- 06:48.440* :  injured from an Israeli airstrikes. But the focus of the Israeli operation is in the north.
*06:49.120- 06:54.220* :  Also the road that Israel is open is damaged so people can't leave with their cars and they
*06:54.220- 07:01.560* :  have to walk five six kilometers on foot under the heat of the sun to come from north to south.
*07:01.560- 07:08.300* :  The process of moving from north to south is not easy for people who are elderly who are not
*07:08.300- 07:15.620* :  fit enough to to make the journey. One of the few correspondents from any news organization still
*07:15.620- 07:22.060* :  in Gaza the BBC's Rusty Abu Aluf. The Hamas run health ministry claims that Israel's bombing
*07:22.060- 07:27.320* :  and ground offensive in Gaza killed more than four and a half thousand children. Israel
*07:27.320- 07:32.820* :  disputes this figure but the World Health Organization says the number is credible. Some of the wounded
*07:32.820- 07:37.320* :  will have to struggle with disabilities for the rest of their lives. Working with freelance
*07:37.320- 07:42.820* :  journalists in Gaza our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yoghater Lemoye sent this report.
*07:46.800- 07:51.900* :  Nihad Abu Jazar sings a popular Arabic children's song to comfort her daughter.
*07:52.440- 07:57.500* :  Do your old father-in-law sits in her mother's lap in the European hospital in Gaza crying.
*07:59.040- 08:03.760* :  She was stuck under the rubble of a bombing three weeks ago. Her legs were crushed.
*08:04.580- 08:11.000* :  They've had to be amputated from below the knee. Nihad and her husband had tried for 14 years to
*08:11.000- 08:20.620* :  have a baby and then Fatima was born. What is her fault? What did she do wrong? We have to constantly
*08:20.660- 08:28.420* :  give her pain killers. As soon as the effect of one wears off I give her another. Her life revolves
*08:28.420- 08:33.060* :  around pain killers and every other day she undergoes surgery.
*08:39.280- 08:43.660* :  11-year-old Asif Abumazan jokes with other patients in the hospital room.
*08:44.520- 08:50.420* :  Laughter might seem out of place but it's one way of coping with endless grief and fear.
*08:57.840- 09:02.260* :  Asif says he was playing a game of football with his friends when a bomb struck,
*09:02.980- 09:10.280* :  destroyed his home and permanently changed his life. His right leg has been amputated below the knee.
*09:11.260- 09:17.680* :  I wanted to become a football player but that dream has been destroyed. I was quite good. You
*09:17.680- 09:23.580* :  can check with my coach if you want. Asif said, my uniform is buried under the rubble of my home,
*09:23.580- 09:30.000* :  my socks are gone, my shoes and the football I had. They've all turned to dust.
*09:32.500- 09:37.380* :  Behind his brave face is a boy scared for his future, his mother says.
*09:39.740- 09:45.460* :  He asks me if I go back to school will my classmates call me the boy with a severed leg?
*09:46.220- 09:52.200* :  Will they make fun of me? At night I often find him crying while looking at old pictures
*09:52.200- 09:58.000* :  of him running or playing football. There's no school, no home to go back to.
*10:00.560- 10:06.340* :  Hospitals are filling up with the dead and wounded. A large number of them are children.
*10:07.480- 10:11.640* :  Trapped in Gaza under the constant threat of being bombed.
*10:16.040- 10:22.920* :  13-year-old Amira Al-Badavi lies in a hospital bed. She has striking light brown eyes and dark
*10:22.920- 10:28.880* :  hair. She looks through photos on her phone of her family who were killed in an air strike.
*10:29.820- 10:36.940* :  Seven of her brothers and her mother too. Her father Iyad says they've fled to southern Gaza for
*10:36.940- 10:41.940* :  safety as warned by the Israeli military. That's where they were bombed.
*10:46.480- 10:54.120* :  Amira has suffered severe injuries to her spine. I want peace and security. I want to be treated
*10:54.120- 11:01.220* :  for my injuries and go back to normal life to my home. I want to feel safe, she says.
*11:02.740- 11:06.420* :  It's not clear if Amira will be able to walk again.
*11:10.140- 11:17.060* :  A difficult listen. The BBC's Yoghater-Lamoye working with freelance journalists in Gaza.
*11:18.460- 11:22.740* :  The war has had repercussions for Jewish communities around the world. Many countries have
*11:22.740- 11:28.060* :  experienced a spike in anti-semitism and in Germany pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been
*11:28.060- 11:33.740* :  banned. The country is a staunch ally of Israel partly because of its Nazi past. The Holocaust
*11:33.740- 11:39.580* :  which took the lives of six million Jews weighs heavily on the German conscience. But the ongoing
*11:39.580- 11:45.700* :  conflict between Israel and Hamas has exposed divisions in society. Our correspondent in Berlin,
*11:45.700- 11:47.420* :  Jessica Parker sent this report.
*11:57.340- 12:02.520* :  On a Wednesday morning, Berlin woke up to news that two Molotov cocktails have been thrown
*12:02.520- 12:11.160* :  at a local synagogue. They hit the pavement but it sparked horror in Germany and alarm in the Jewish
*12:11.220- 12:20.360* :  community. Weeks later, Berlin's chief rabbi leads his congregation in song.
*12:23.600- 12:28.580* :  22-year-old Aaron fled Ukraine but now feels this is no sanctuary.
*12:28.940- 12:35.880* :  Now, as you know, in Berlin is unsafe place, unsafe city. Because a lot of people support
*12:35.880- 12:40.280* :  to a realistic organization. You really feel it unsafe in Berlin for Jewish people?
*12:40.480- 12:49.880* :  Yes. Because actually people who are Jewish, they must hide the keeper. They just must be
*12:49.880- 12:54.020* :  care about the Jewishness and don't show them.
*12:54.760- 12:57.160* :  Noah, who's 24, is also uneasy.
*12:58.160- 13:04.900* :  In Germany, I think in general, we always felt as Jews that we are part of society. But every time
*13:05.020- 13:10.840* :  there is a war in Israel, every time something comes up, it just hits us again and again that we are not
*13:11.180- 13:19.020* :  full part of the society. Chancellor Olav Schultz has voiced anguish that Jews don't feel safe.
*13:23.700- 13:30.060* :  Some pro-Palestinian protests have been banned, certain slogans too, violence has erupted.
*13:32.340- 13:37.300* :  One group was disbanded after accusations it celebrated the October 7th attacks.
*13:37.840- 13:41.860* :  Senior politicians averaged people, particularly from parts of the political left
*13:41.860- 13:46.300* :  and Muslim backgrounds, to distance themselves from the actions of her mass.
*13:46.380- 13:53.740* :  But as a permitted protest in Berlin, many feel that the crackdowns are too arbitrary.
*13:54.440- 13:58.120* :  There's a sea of people here on Alexander Platts and Palestinian flags.
*13:58.140- 14:03.540* :  Germany's not alone in having a divisive conversation about what's been happening in Israel
*14:03.540- 14:08.700* :  and Gaza, although it is perhaps particularly sensitive because of the nation's history.
*14:09.380- 14:14.000* :  But at events like this, you can feel a tension and an anger about how that national
*14:14.000- 14:19.260* :  conversation is being handled. I have to do something. I have to be positioning myself standing
*14:19.260- 14:24.960* :  here for protest. Nadine is half German, half Palestinian. He says Germany should be more prepared
*14:24.960- 14:32.020* :  to talk about Israel's actions. The narrative in the newspapers is, for my opinion, quite one-sided.
*14:32.800- 14:37.520* :  It's a healthy process for every nation to get criticized.
*14:37.740- 14:41.060* :  Sammy has family in the West Bank.
*14:41.060- 14:49.120* :  As a treatment solution, I think we should be allowed to demonstrate peacefully to show people
*14:49.560- 14:53.620* :  that we are in pain over what's happening in Gaza, what's been done to the Palestinians
*14:53.620- 14:58.680* :  since 1948, before seeing the videos, what they are doing to our children.
*15:00.360- 15:06.420* :  Israel's security is a reason of state for Germany, or stats raison, as Dr Felix Klein,
*15:06.420- 15:09.120* :  Germany's commissioner for Jewish life, explains.
*15:09.120- 15:14.940* :  The vast majority of our political leaders, particularly these days, underline that this is
*15:14.940- 15:21.260* :  really a German state doctrine, but that implies also the obligation to protect the Jewish
*15:21.260- 15:22.840* :  population in Germany itself.
*15:31.440- 15:37.520* :  At an event to mark the November pogroms of 1938, people listen to the theme of Schindler's
*15:37.520- 15:43.820* :  list. In Germany, past horrors play loudly, but there's now a notable discord between the
*15:43.820- 15:48.880* :  political classes and some in wider society about how to discuss the present.
*15:52.620- 16:01.560* :  Jessica Parker reporting.
*16:04.000- 16:04.440* :  Coming up.
*16:04.940- 16:10.860* :  Initially, it's this intense relief, but absolutely, it is daintiously afterwards a great sense of
*16:10.860- 16:15.720* :  euphoria. Scientists finally see proof of a mammal they believed was extinct.
*16:23.640- 16:29.900* :  Surgeons at New York University say they've carried out the world's first complete i-transplant.
*16:30.340- 16:36.300* :  Aaron James underwent 21 hours of surgery to receive the new left i in an operation that replaced
*16:36.300- 16:41.980* :  half of his face. Although blood is now flowing to the retina, it's not certain he'll regain vision.
*16:42.440- 16:43.500* :  Sean Dilly reports.
*16:45.560- 16:47.480* :  This is a medical first.
*16:48.820- 16:52.920* :  Aaron James is the first human recipient of a whole transplanted eye.
*17:17.620- 17:23.040* :  Surgeons here in New York spent 21 hours removing part of their donor's face and left eye,
*17:23.540- 17:27.460* :  including the optic nerve, then skillfully grafting them onto their patient.
*17:28.140- 17:33.440* :  This is a day that could so easily have never come for Aaron James. The 46-year-old electrical
*17:33.440- 17:40.080* :  worker from Arkansas suffered life-changing injuries in June 2021 after his face contact
*17:40.080- 17:47.880* :  at a 7,200-volt live wire. The accident cost him his left arm, nose, lips, front teeth,
*17:47.880- 17:51.160* :  and left eye, as well as his chin and part of his cheek.
*17:54.660- 18:00.740* :  It's been six months since the experimental surgery. So far, the transplanted eye sees nothing,
*18:01.140- 18:04.080* :  but surgeons are positive about what this means for the future.
*18:09.660- 18:12.260* :  It looks healthy. It's pretty special.
*18:13.100- 18:17.220* :  For Aaron James, the cosmetic benefits are plain for others to see,
*18:17.220- 18:22.220* :  even if his new left eye can't. But doctors say the first whole human eye transplant
*18:22.880- 18:28.080* :  offers real hope that what they've learnt here could one day restore sight to those who cannot see.
*18:29.640- 18:35.660* :  Sean Dilly. They only earned about $75 a month, which will be increased by 50%,
*18:35.660- 18:40.480* :  but as saying, that's not nearly enough. Clothing factory workers in Bangladesh have been
*18:40.480- 18:46.100* :  protesting for two weeks, but it now seems that they will not get another pay rise. I heard more
*18:46.100- 18:51.100* :  from our South Asia regional editor and Barossaan Etirajan. The common factory workers in
*18:51.100- 18:55.580* :  Bangladesh, they are talking about how they are struggling to make a living with their
*18:55.580- 19:01.180* :  current salary of $75 a month. What they point out is in the last three years because of global
*19:01.180- 19:07.400* :  events like Ukraine, war and the Middle East conflict, food prices have escalated and some
*19:07.400- 19:12.280* :  of the items have doubled or even tripled and the rents have gone up. So these are basically
*19:12.280- 19:17.140* :  villagers coming from different parts of Bangladesh, coming to big cities like Dhaka or in
*19:17.880- 19:23.040* :  Chathogram, trying to find some sort of one-bedroom in a shanty town with their families
*19:23.860- 19:27.720* :  and trying to take care of the families. It is difficult and that's why they are saying
*19:27.720- 19:35.260* :  we need at least $205 a month as a basic minimum wage for a month. Now the Prime Minister
*19:35.260- 19:42.140* :  shakazin has ruled out what she says is already they are getting 56% pay hike and if they are going
*19:42.140- 19:47.000* :  to protest, which normally leads to more violence and some factories have been damaged, then
*19:47.020- 19:51.860* :  the factories might close as a result. They might lose their jobs and they have to go back to
*19:51.860- 19:57.660* :  the villages. And they are protesting on mass. Thousands of workers have been protesting for the
*19:57.660- 20:02.860* :  last two weeks around the capital Dhaka and in other areas as well because these factories
*20:02.860- 20:07.960* :  employ thousands of people at least three to four thousand for each factory. A number of factories
*20:07.960- 20:12.200* :  have been damaged and the owners are saying that they will shut down these factories if they are
*20:12.200- 20:16.740* :  going to get attacked because they've invested a lot of money and they are providing jobs and they
*20:16.740- 20:22.720* :  are now having these export orders from major global fashion brands. And the owners of these
*20:22.720- 20:27.960* :  factories are saying is that if the Western companies like what we talk about Zara or H&M
*20:28.460- 20:33.620* :  or even Wal-Mart if they can pay a bit more to what the clothes they are buying even though
*20:34.160- 20:38.020* :  they are making a lot of money in the Western capitals and then we are willing to pay more
*20:38.020- 20:43.500* :  to the workers. So where's this going? Every five years they have this review of this salary
*20:43.500- 20:47.240* :  for the government workers. We're talking about four million people, most of them women,
*20:47.240- 20:52.140* :  you know they support families. Now this is a big tussle between the unions and the factories
*20:52.140- 20:58.120* :  every five years but what we see is they reach a compromise at some point but also it highlights
*20:58.120- 21:03.640* :  this issue to the global fashion brands and for people in the Western world from where the most
*21:03.640- 21:08.920* :  of these clothes come. See, Asia has become the tailoring capital of the world. We all need clothes,
*21:08.920- 21:15.400* :  we all need to fashion but where it is coming from. So it is also a reminder not only to the
*21:15.400- 21:19.720* :  government of Bangladesh or the factory owners also to the fashion brands and consumers.
*21:19.720- 21:26.960* :  And Barassan at a Russian. Spiky, furry and with a beak it has been called a living fossil,
*21:27.380- 21:32.920* :  named the Attenborough Akidna after the broadcaster Sir David until now the only proof it existed
*21:32.920- 21:39.260* :  at all was a single specimen gathered 62 years ago. At first glance you might think that this
*21:39.260- 21:45.720* :  mammal is some sort of hedgehog or perhaps a porcupine but actually it's weirdly different
*21:45.880- 21:51.380* :  from a hedgehog, a porcupine or almost any other kind of mammal. It's an Akidna.
*21:52.080- 21:58.160* :  The BBC's Sir David Attenborough. Well now a team of scientists from Oxford University has captured
*21:58.960- 22:05.120* :  video of the egg laying mammal on an expedition to a remote part of Indonesia. Dr James
*22:05.120- 22:11.160* :  Kenpton is the lead researcher and he said they nearly missed the discovery. I'm not lying when I
*22:11.160- 22:16.940* :  say this. It was in the last images of the last SD card that we collected from the last day of
*22:16.940- 22:21.940* :  our final attempt at the psychops mountains that we found those images of Attenborough's Long Beach
*22:21.940- 22:27.060* :  Akidna. When we discovered it there was an Italy just this great sense of relief because this
*22:27.060- 22:32.140* :  expedition was three and a half years of planning and we'd seen signs of the Akidna in the field
*22:32.140- 22:38.720* :  the holes that it makes when it forages but no pictures until that very final day. Initially it's
*22:38.720- 22:44.160* :  this intense relief but absolutely it is dintaneously afterwards a great sense of euphoria.
*22:44.580- 22:50.280* :  I was the the last scientist who'd remained. I'd already come down from the mountains and I was
*22:50.280- 22:56.480* :  looking through the images, saw the Akidna and just burst out beaming and ran out into the living
*22:56.480- 23:00.900* :  room of the base house where we were and said to my papu and colleagues who are still with me.
*23:01.060- 23:05.340* :  We found it. We found it. It's a very bizarre group of animals. These are called the
*23:05.340- 23:10.300* :  Monatrims. They're egg-laying mammals. They include duck-billed platypus and then there are four
*23:10.300- 23:16.880* :  other Akidna species and they split off from the rest of the mammal tree of life about 200 million
*23:16.880- 23:22.920* :  years ago. So they've been evolving independently from marsupials like koalas and wombats and from
*23:22.920- 23:28.860* :  us the placental mammals that include humans. They're over about 200 million years so that's why
*23:28.860- 23:34.560* :  they're so special and there are only five of them left. Five species that preserve this unique
*23:34.560- 23:42.860* :  fragile, ebony-bony-bony-bony history. And you can see images of the Akidna on our website at bbcnews.com.
*23:42.860- 23:48.020* :  Just go to the science and environment pages. That was the lead researcher, Dr. James Kempton.
*23:49.280- 23:55.320* :  The American singer Tracy Chapman has become the first black songwriter to win the country music
*23:55.320- 24:00.800* :  association song of the year award for Fast Car which she released 35 years ago.
*24:01.320- 24:07.000* :  So remember when we were driving, driving in your car, speed so fast it felt like I was drunk,
*24:07.000- 24:13.100* :  city like day out before, and here I'm feeling like scrap ground my children, I did high.
*24:13.420- 24:18.900* :  Well, it became a huge hit again in America this summer when Luke Coombs released a cover
*24:18.900- 24:25.100* :  version which also won single of the year at the award ceremony in Nashville. Tracy Chapman said
*24:25.100- 24:30.600* :  the awards were truly an honor. My colleague Martha Coney spoke to Francesca Roister and English
*24:30.600- 24:37.100* :  professor at DePaul University in Chicago who has written black country music listening for
*24:37.100- 24:44.160* :  revolutions. I'm really pleased. I was very excited to see the news this morning when I opened up
*24:44.180- 24:53.100* :  the paper. It was really happy news because I think that the song speaks to so many different
*24:53.100- 25:00.260* :  audiences and I'm glad that it's getting renewed and new audiences as well. It meant so much to
*25:00.260- 25:06.900* :  me when it first came out because the awards were recognizing the cover version by Luke Coombs
*25:06.900- 25:12.400* :  but Tracy Chapman held self said I'm happy for Luke and his success and grateful that new fans
*25:12.400- 25:18.960* :  have embraced Fast Car. Yes, that's that's true and one of the things that I think is really
*25:18.960- 25:26.560* :  cool about you know the best song award is that it's also you know recognizing not only the vocal
*25:26.560- 25:32.800* :  performance but the artistry of you know the storytelling and the song which I think is really
*25:32.800- 25:41.860* :  why it's continued to be so well loved over over so many years. And that storytelling is such a
*25:41.860- 25:49.020* :  strong element isn't it of country music so it fits the genre doesn't it? Yeah it really does and
*25:49.240- 25:58.160* :  even the way that the song is able to move between different moods of like elation and memory of
*25:58.160- 26:07.980* :  like like happier times and yearning and then also anger like it has that emotional fluidity
*26:07.980- 26:14.380* :  that I think really good songs are also able to do. And it's a powerful song in the sense that it
*26:14.380- 26:23.080* :  also doesn't have a happy ending. Right it doesn't it's like the song is always holding up kind of
*26:23.080- 26:29.940* :  this dream or possibility of belonging and escape and you know feeling like you could be someone
*26:29.940- 26:36.500* :  feeling like this is you know the path to happiness and then having that that path disappointed
*26:37.200- 26:42.080* :  but I'm still you know when I listen to it I'm not unhappy when I get to the end of it because I
*26:42.080- 26:47.060* :  feel like you know there's an energy behind the disappointment and the anger and I feel like
*26:47.060- 26:54.580* :  the story is going to keep going somehow. Francesco Royster the author of Black Country Music listening for
