*00:06.280- 00:07.500* :  Like absolutely good luck.
*00:07.500- 00:08.540* :  Amazing to me.
*00:08.540- 00:11.800* :  That's Unexpected Elements from the BBC World Service.
*00:12.240- 00:14.720* :  Find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*00:15.480- 00:18.740* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:20.980- 00:25.760* :  And at Karachi and in the early hours of Friday the 3rd of November these are our main stories.
*00:26.380- 00:32.140* :  We have completely surrounded Gaza City, say the Israelis, as the fighting with Hamas intensifies.
*00:32.740- 00:38.480* :  Meanwhile, fighting is also getting fiercer along Israel's border with Lebanon, where the army faces Hezbollah.
*00:39.120- 00:44.720* :  And the commander of Ukraine's armed forces says the war with Russia has reached a stalemate.
*00:46.840- 00:52.320* :  Also in this podcast, the violent and lucrative attempts to smuggle migrants into the EU.
*00:52.660- 00:58.640* :  Right now you have a wire on a border that wire has only one purpose.
*00:59.300- 01:03.720* :  Not to stop migrations, but to have control of pain.
*01:04.780- 01:07.880* :  And a sweet romantic sound or a belly nuisance.
*01:08.040- 01:11.320* :  How a Swiss village is divided over cowbells.
*01:13.820- 01:17.800* :  But first, nearly a month after Israel declared war on Hamas.
*01:18.100- 01:20.220* :  The army has said it's surrounded Gaza City.
*01:20.220- 01:27.120* :  The Hamas run health ministry in Gaza said more than 9,000 people have now been killed since October 7th.
*01:27.420- 01:34.400* :  When more than 1,400 people were massacred in Israel and 242 taken hostage according to the Israeli army.
*01:34.840- 01:40.180* :  On the ground, Israeli soldiers are facing hit and run attacks from fighters coming out of their underground tunnels.
*01:40.180- 01:44.640* :  While in the air fighter jets continue to pound what the military says are Hamas targets.
*01:45.280- 01:48.220* :  Civilians, though, continue to haul victim to the bombings.
*01:48.580- 01:50.200* :  As John Donetson reports from Jerusalem.
*01:54.360- 01:58.240* :  Almost four weeks after Hamas's unprecedented cross-border attack,
*01:58.240- 02:01.660* :  Israel's retaliation shows no sign of relenting.
*02:02.260- 02:05.660* :  In the north, Jabbalia was once again targeted with air strikes.
*02:05.660- 02:10.640* :  It happened close to a UN school where thousands of people are seeking shelter.
*02:11.260- 02:16.140* :  Pictures from the scene show the school itself seems to have been hit by a much smaller weapon.
*02:16.640- 02:19.180* :  Dozens of people are reported to have been killed.
*02:19.820- 02:24.240* :  But inside the school compound, there was panic as people searched for their loved ones.
*02:27.540- 02:30.500* :  Find my son, find my son, a father screams.
*02:34.500- 02:38.020* :  We did nothing wrong, a small boy cries.
*02:40.420- 02:46.980* :  And in the center of Gaza, in the supposed safe zone, emergency workers were pulling bodies from the rubble this afternoon.
*02:47.400- 02:52.200* :  After Palestinian health officials said Israel bombed the El-Barej refugee camp,
*02:52.200- 02:56.360* :  killing at least 15 people and injuring more than 150.
*02:58.700- 03:01.660* :  I was in the house there and I heard the sound of five missiles.
*03:02.320- 03:04.260* :  We ran here and we found this damage.
*03:04.820- 03:08.620* :  We found dead bodies and the dead bodies of many children were lying on top.
*03:10.860- 03:14.060* :  Israel is also pushing forward with its ground offensive.
*03:17.660- 03:23.020* :  The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this afternoon his country was at the height of the battle
*03:23.500- 03:27.400* :  and that Israeli forces had advanced past the outskirts of Gaza City.
*03:27.920- 03:30.260* :  But it's coming at a cost to Israel too.
*03:33.480- 03:37.140* :  Today, a funeral for 19-year-old Sergeant Leo Siminovitch.
*03:39.920- 03:42.140* :  And grief for his parents as he was buried.
*03:43.100- 03:48.180* :  19 Israeli soldiers are now known to have been killed since the ground offensive began.
*03:50.640- 03:52.060* :  John Donerson in Jerusalem.
*03:52.500- 03:58.680* :  Meanwhile, fighting is intensifying along Israel's border with Lebanon, with exchanges between the army and Hezbollah.
*03:59.080- 04:02.620* :  Like Hamas, a group which is backed by Israel's arch-enemy Iran.
*04:03.160- 04:06.920* :  Our correspondent Hugo Bachego is in southern Lebanon and gave this update.
*04:07.560- 04:12.860* :  We had Hezbollah saying that he had struck 19 Israeli positions simultaneously.
*04:13.500- 04:16.100* :  We haven't had independent confirmation of that.
*04:16.100- 04:18.800* :  It's very difficult to get independent confirmation of those claims.
*04:19.200- 04:22.900* :  But even the claim is significant here because if this is confirmed,
*04:22.900- 04:28.320* :  it marks the most intense wave of attacks by Hezbollah targeting Israeli positions
*04:28.460- 04:31.360* :  in this war between Israel and Hamas.
*04:31.640- 04:38.620* :  And I think there was another claim by Hezbollah earlier that he had used explosive drones to again target Israeli positions.
*04:38.620- 04:43.920* :  Again, it was the first time that they said they had used this kind of drone to attack Israeli positions.
*04:43.920- 04:53.060* :  And so we're seeing what seems to be an intensification perhaps of the violence happening here along the border between Lebanon and Israel.
*04:53.060- 04:58.320* :  And the Israeli military said he had responded to a number of launches from Lebanese territory.
*04:58.320- 05:04.400* :  They didn't really specify the attacks, they didn't confirm the number that had been put forward by Hezbollah.
*05:04.880- 05:09.480* :  They said they had struck military facilities, military infrastructure used by Hezbollah.
*05:09.480- 05:13.420* :  But again, I think the fear here is that if the violence here escalates,
*05:14.080- 05:16.240* :  Lebanon could be dragged into this conflict.
*05:16.500- 05:18.980* :  Now we know the Hezbollah lead Hassan Nasrallah,
*05:18.980- 05:22.300* :  do you give a speech and the indication of what he might say?
*05:22.700- 05:27.780* :  Yes, so I think everybody here, and across the region is waiting to hear from Hassan Nasrallah,
*05:27.780- 05:30.580* :  he's remained silent since the beginning of the war.
*05:30.980- 05:34.960* :  So it's been more than three weeks that we haven't heard anything from Hassan Nasrallah.
*05:35.420- 05:38.980* :  And there hasn't been any indication about what he's about to say.
*05:38.980- 05:42.820* :  And I think people are obviously watching, you know,
*05:42.820- 05:48.860* :  be watching his speech to get any kind of indication of what Hezbollah is going to do next.
*05:48.860- 05:56.200* :  I think there's a lot of apprehension here that Hezbollah may decide to intensify its attacks against Israel.
*05:56.840- 06:00.720* :  And obviously we've heard from a number of Israeli officials who have been warning Hezbollah
*06:01.180- 06:03.020* :  against escalating the situation.
*06:03.100- 06:09.520* :  I think Prime Minister Netanyahu last week said that an Israeli response would be of unimaginable magnitude.
*06:09.520- 06:18.040* :  And also American officials have been warning, not only Hezbollah, but also its main backer Iran against escalating the situation.
*06:18.120- 06:23.540* :  So everybody waiting to see what Hassan Nasrallah is going to say when he makes his first public speech.
*06:24.620- 06:26.220* :  You go Bacheca there in Lebanon.
*06:26.800- 06:31.240* :  Well, the war in the Middle East has overshadowed other conflicts, such as the one in Myanmar.
*06:31.800- 06:36.580* :  Burmese military is saying it has lost control of a northern town on the border with China.
*06:36.580- 06:40.980* :  The days of fighting with three armed ethnic groups pushing for autonomy.
*06:41.540- 06:42.920* :  Beijing has called for a ceasefire.
*06:43.000- 06:49.460* :  It had been planning to build a billion dollar rail link as part of its belt and road infrastructure initiative.
*06:50.200- 06:53.200* :  So in Tan is the editor of BBC Burmese.
*06:53.580- 06:56.720* :  Bachecazby asked him to give us more details on this unrest.
*06:57.420- 07:04.260* :  On 27 October, three rebel groups of the alliance, they formed an alliance and they launched this audacious attack,
*07:04.260- 07:06.620* :  pre-don attack against the military posts.
*07:07.380- 07:09.880* :  They scores several victories from that day on.
*07:09.880- 07:19.960* :  They have ceased a few towns and up until now they set the over-rend, at least 90 army outposts in that region.
*07:20.380- 07:21.820* :  So there was a major victory.
*07:21.820- 07:29.560* :  Then the regime spokesperson today came out and admitted that they have lost control of at least three towns in that area.
*07:29.900- 07:36.860* :  Yeah, were you quite surprised to hear that because you don't often get that kind of statement from the Myanmar or Burmese authorities, do you?
*07:36.900- 07:39.440* :  Yes, it's quite unusual. They came out and admitted.
*07:39.920- 07:46.620* :  So the main reason he said, the spokesperson said is he wanted to counter the propaganda by the rebel groups.
*07:46.660- 07:50.600* :  The rebel groups were saying that they have seen several towns.
*07:50.600- 07:56.600* :  But he said to counter that he admitted that yes, we lost control of three area, three towns.
*07:56.600- 08:02.200* :  Because usually army was very, very proud and then they would not readily admit of their defeat.
*08:03.280- 08:07.280* :  So tell us a little bit more about these armed ethnic groups. Who are they? What do they want?
*08:08.160- 08:15.160* :  They are the Myanmar has means over 100 ethnic groups and several formed their own armies.
*08:15.160- 08:20.560* :  So these three groups formed their own army along the border with China.
*08:21.100- 08:26.300* :  Two are on the border with China, but the other one is quite far away on the western flank of Myanmar.
*08:26.300- 08:29.600* :  They also join in have some troops on the border.
*08:30.140- 08:34.480* :  So they are fighting for more autonomy. They want to have their own say.
*08:34.480- 08:39.020* :  They want to have a more control on the resources from their regions.
*08:39.580- 08:41.920* :  So they have been in existence for some several years.
*08:42.380- 08:46.440* :  But since the military coup, they formed alliance among themselves.
*08:46.520- 08:51.400* :  They formed alliance with other ethnic groups and started to attack the military.
*08:51.800- 08:54.480* :  Yeah, it does seem as if they're working together, doesn't it?
*08:54.780- 08:57.460* :  We mentioned that China has called for a ceasefire.
*08:57.720- 09:01.520* :  And it had been planning this really expensive rail link, I think.
*09:01.560- 09:03.240* :  Tell us a bit more about that.
*09:03.660- 09:07.380* :  Yeah, it's part of this kind of China's ambitious road and belt initiative.
*09:07.380- 09:11.480* :  So, you know, it's from the China's western regions are landlocked.
*09:11.480- 09:17.040* :  So they wanted to have this, you know, the cross, they are planning a real and road links,
*09:17.560- 09:21.240* :  crossing Myanmar from this eastern part to western part,
*09:21.820- 09:24.400* :  so that they will have a gateway towards the Indian Ocean.
*09:25.100- 09:26.780* :  So they've been kind of building on this project.
*09:26.780- 09:29.860* :  That's why they made some overtures to the current military regimes.
*09:29.860- 09:31.680* :  They are talking to the military regime.
*09:31.680- 09:35.700* :  China always insisted that they wanted some stability on the border.
*09:36.180- 09:39.200* :  So when these kind of violence and fightings broke out,
*09:39.360- 09:42.220* :  then Chinese were actively calling for the ceasefire.
*09:42.620- 09:46.780* :  Today also China made another statement, like in a calling for a ceasefire, immediate ceasefire.
*09:47.480- 09:50.100* :  Does China have any influence with these rebel groups?
*09:50.100- 09:54.260* :  They are, yeah, because on the border of China, I mean offer some Texas support
*09:54.260- 09:58.220* :  and these rebel groups, you know, for they are like, you know,
*09:58.700- 10:01.400* :  any type of logistic and support that they need China,
*10:02.840- 10:04.500* :  they need to be China to be on their site.
*10:05.320- 10:07.480* :  So both sites, like Myanmar regime and the ethnic rebels,
*10:07.480- 10:08.980* :  they are trying to win over China.
*10:10.200- 10:17.340* :  So in Tan, the editor of BBC Burmese, an AI summit being held here in Britain
*10:17.340- 10:22.220* :  has seen delegates and technology experts from 28 countries coming together.
*10:22.780- 10:26.480* :  They've discussed minimizing the most serious threats the technology might pose.
*10:27.340- 10:30.480* :  Some government and tech representatives have already agreed to work together
*10:30.540- 10:34.240* :  to test the safety of new AI models before they're released.
*10:34.800- 10:39.340* :  China, which had signed a broader statement on a common approach to AI on Wednesday,
*10:39.940- 10:41.420* :  appeared not to be included.
*10:41.840- 10:44.100* :  Our technology editor Zoe Klyman reports.
*10:44.880- 10:47.880* :  Day two of the AI summit was all about power.
*10:48.380- 10:52.160* :  It was Rishi Sunak running the show today hosting two top level discussions,
*10:52.600- 10:55.100* :  the first between a select group of world leaders
*10:55.520- 10:59.060* :  and the second with the bosses of some of the US's greatest tech giants.
*10:59.740- 11:04.340* :  He began with a message about how important it was to get right the delicate balancing act
*11:04.340- 11:08.180* :  between allowing AI to flourish and preventing it from causing harm.
*11:08.560- 11:11.880* :  AI has the potential to transform our lives in every aspect,
*11:11.880- 11:14.580* :  from healthcare to education and our economy.
*11:14.940- 11:20.360* :  But there is a case to believe that it may pose risks on a scale like pandemics in nuclear war
*11:20.380- 11:23.620* :  and that's why as leaders we have a responsibility to act.
*11:23.940- 11:26.460* :  It's been a gathering where plenty of promises have been made.
*11:26.500- 11:32.540* :  All 28 countries, including China, have agreed to urgently prioritize AI safety.
*11:32.540- 11:38.180* :  They'll be follow-up summits in the next 12 months and are pledged to put resources into research and expertise.
*11:39.020- 11:42.600* :  The presence of the tech billionaire Elon Musk has added some sparkle,
*11:43.080- 11:47.120* :  including among locals outside the venue who told me they were hoping to catch a glimpse of him.
*11:47.700- 11:51.100* :  He and the Prime Minister will be in conversation tonight at a different venue
*11:51.380- 11:53.100* :  in front of an invited audience.
*11:53.620- 11:57.680* :  Those without a golden ticket will have to wait until the recorded version appears on X,
*11:57.680- 11:59.720* :  formerly Twitter, at around 9pm.
*11:59.720- 12:04.500* :  The film is not being made by Mr Musk's company and it won't be live streamed.
*12:05.280- 12:06.060* :  So we climb in there.
*12:06.940- 12:11.400* :  It's been over 20 months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
*12:11.400- 12:15.840* :  but weapons supplied by the West have not allowed Ukraine to push through Russian defenses
*12:16.280- 12:17.260* :  in the way Kiev had hoped.
*12:17.720- 12:23.540* :  Now, in a candid interview with the economist, the commander of Ukraine's armed forces, Valery Zalushny,
*12:23.940- 12:25.880* :  says, just like the First World War,
*12:25.880- 12:30.700* :  both sides have reached a stalemate and no significant breakthrough is imminent.
*12:31.280- 12:33.860* :  I asked our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Aberhard,
*12:33.860- 12:37.280* :  why General Zalushny had used that kind of expression.
*12:37.900- 12:42.680* :  He characterizes it now as the war entering a different stage of what he calls positional warfare.
*12:42.680- 12:47.640* :  That's an attritional static fighting, something similar to what we saw in World War I.
*12:48.200- 12:52.900* :  And he said that there's a risk of this in terms of it possibly wearing down the Ukrainian state.
*12:52.900- 12:57.260* :  So it's different from the maneuver warfare as he calls it that we saw last year,
*12:57.260- 12:59.820* :  for example, in the advances in Kharkiv.
*13:00.180- 13:04.760* :  He puts this down basically to what he describes as a level of technological development
*13:04.760- 13:07.820* :  of the two sides that have put both sides in a stupor.
*13:07.820- 13:12.340* :  So he's kind of describing a technical and a tactical equilibrium
*13:12.880- 13:15.600* :  where advances when they come are very small and slow.
*13:16.080- 13:20.360* :  He said that basically the Russians can see everything that the Ukrainians are doing
*13:20.360- 13:22.780* :  and the Ukrainians can see everything that the Russians are doing
*13:23.180- 13:26.480* :  and that with modern precision weapons troops can be targeted.
*13:26.960- 13:28.620* :  So there's a sort of a parity there.
*13:29.080- 13:32.600* :  And he warns that a long war would favor Russia, Nick.
*13:32.600- 13:38.960* :  So basically Russia has advantages in manpower, ammunition, missiles, air defenses, for example.
*13:39.500- 13:43.000* :  And so he's very clear, he says Russia should not be underestimated
*13:43.000- 13:48.020* :  and he cannot belittle the effectiveness of Russian weapons and intelligence.
*13:48.280- 13:50.260* :  Well, this is really a stark acknowledgement, isn't it?
*13:50.260- 13:52.820* :  What does he say needs to be done to break this down there?
*13:53.080- 13:57.280* :  Well, he described a situation where with a combination of technological breakthroughs,
*13:57.280- 14:02.880* :  you could actually then revert away from sort of positional warfare to a more dynamic situation.
*14:02.960- 14:05.740* :  He breaks his down into five categories.
*14:05.740- 14:08.000* :  So he says Ukraine needs better air power.
*14:08.260- 14:13.000* :  In some ways this is things like F-16s, the fighter jets, although he says that is likely
*14:13.000- 14:16.480* :  to be less effective when they come than if they'd arrived a year ago
*14:16.480- 14:18.560* :  because Russian air defenses have improved.
*14:18.560- 14:21.380* :  But he also talks about drones quite a lot.
*14:21.500- 14:27.100* :  So basically trying to improve Ukraine's capacities for attack drones, reconnaissance drones,
*14:27.100- 14:30.600* :  and even hunter drones to attack Russian drones coming in.
*14:30.840- 14:36.640* :  But he also describes improving electronic warfare, counter-battery fire against Russian artillery,
*14:36.640- 14:41.560* :  technology to breach Russian minefields which are in some places up to 20 kilometers deep,
*14:42.000- 14:43.600* :  and building up Ukraine's reserves.

*15:18.560- 15:20.060* :  And the game changers.
*15:20.420- 15:21.980* :  I want to play like my brother.

*15:39.820- 15:43.200* :  Shots are fired nearly every night between rivaled people smuggling gangs.
*15:43.760- 15:45.160* :  The police have also been shot at.

*15:50.420- 15:55.360* :  The police report sawing numbers of car chases as smugglers tried to avoid arrest.

*16:10.220- 16:13.360* :  A gun battle on the Serbian side of the Hungarian border.
*16:13.760- 16:19.780* :  This one, in the city of Subotitsar in July last year, left one person dead and seven injured.
*16:23.120- 16:27.620* :  Police and intelligence sources say guns appeared about a year ago on this border.
*16:28.200- 16:33.920* :  Until now, four gangs, Moroccan, Afghan and Syrian, controlled access to the Hungarian fence.
*16:34.540- 16:42.300* :  Now several others, including Kosovo Albanians, who until now smuggled many drugs or weapons, are trying to displace them.
*16:42.900- 16:46.440* :  Local people are afraid, says journalist Virag Djurkovic.
*16:46.700- 16:57.380* :  I understand the fear of the people because it is not normal situation here to hear shootings and to be in the centre of those conflicts.
*16:57.560- 17:06.320* :  But the problem is that average people don't make a difference between the human traffickers and refugees.
*17:07.100- 17:10.720* :  Although the refugees are also the victims of the human traffickers.
*17:18.500- 17:24.780* :  In this video filmed on a mobile phone in a tent, a smuggler is seen beating Afghan migrants
*17:24.780- 17:28.460* :  who tried to cross the fence into Hungary without paying a gang.
*17:30.500- 17:37.320* :  While the Hungarian government says its fence is effective at stopping tens of thousands of migrants entering the country,
*17:37.800- 17:41.660* :  Serbian activist Vladimir Polovina says they still get through.
*17:42.220- 17:45.920* :  The smugglers are working hand in glove with the police, he believes.
*17:46.020- 17:52.220* :  Right now you have a wire on a border that wire has only one purpose.
*17:53.460- 17:59.520* :  Not to stop migrations, but to have control of paying migrant Nazis.
*17:59.860- 18:04.080* :  They want every euro, from every man who crosses over the border.
*18:04.540- 18:06.020* :  If you have a wire you can do that.
*18:07.080- 18:13.160* :  Walking down a sandy track, not far from the Budapest to Belgrade, motorway.
*18:13.720- 18:16.820* :  It's late afternoon, the sun just going down to my left.
*18:17.660- 18:20.240* :  And just over to one side in the year.
*18:20.460- 18:27.720* :  What looks like a well, I can see two figures go over and see if they're willing to talk to me.
*18:29.340- 18:30.820* :  How are you? How are you?
*18:31.220- 18:32.340* :  Fine, so I'll have my liquor.
*18:33.720- 18:37.480* :  Sadar is 33 years old and was an officer in the Afghan army.
*18:37.880- 18:42.520* :  He paid $10,000 in Istanbul for the through trip to Germany he says.
*18:43.140- 18:50.200* :  After crossing Bulgaria and Serbia he's just been delivered to this border for his first attempt to get through the fence.
*18:51.100- 18:57.060* :  I talked to someone who do the agent work, who do the human trafficking.
*18:57.920- 18:59.940* :  And yeah, he said come here.
*19:00.200- 19:04.600* :  Do the smugglers, do the agents treat you kindly or cruelly?
*19:04.900- 19:10.480* :  Sometimes cruelly, sometimes very angry, sometimes very difficult.
*19:10.500- 19:16.920* :  They sometimes beat us and sometimes they're kind because they give us food.
*19:17.980- 19:23.840* :  Austrian and Slovak police complained that thousands of migrants managed to cross through Hungary each month.
*19:23.840- 19:30.780* :  On this intercity train from Budapest to Hamburg I witnessed three Syrian men emerge from the toilet
*19:31.260- 19:34.040* :  when the ticket collector unlocked it from the outside.
*19:42.560- 19:46.640* :  When the train stopped but no, the Syrians got off and started running.
*19:46.640- 19:49.620* :  A free ticket collector might have called the police.
*19:50.320- 19:52.900* :  She happened. At least they were safe on the train.
*20:00.120- 20:02.640* :  More and more migrants are getting hurt in car crashes.
*20:02.640- 20:08.100* :  Drivers who get caught tell police they only get paid by the gangs if they succeed.
*20:08.980- 20:11.640* :  It's a new and very dangerous business model.
*20:13.460- 20:15.560* :  Nick thought there at the Hungarian border.
*20:16.760- 20:21.560* :  Thousands of South African rugby fans have taken to the streets of the capital Pretoria
*20:21.920- 20:24.380* :  to welcome home the nation's victorious rugby team.
*20:24.760- 20:31.980* :  The spring box beat New Zealand's all blacks in Saturday's World Cup Final in Paris to win the trophy for a record fourth time.
*20:32.500- 20:36.200* :  The team has now begun a four day tour of the country on an open top bus.
*20:36.520- 20:39.200* :  Our African regional editor Richard Hamilton has this.
*20:43.900- 20:48.820* :  There were scenes of wild jubilation as the open top bus in green and gold,
*20:48.820- 20:55.640* :  the colors of the spring box drove past the Union buildings in Pretoria, the official seat of government.
*20:55.640- 21:01.960* :  From a balcony the team and president Cyril Ramaposa addressed the rapturous crowd.
*21:02.780- 21:09.460* :  South Africa is suffering from power cuts, economic woes, corruption scandals and high unemployment.
*21:10.080- 21:12.900* :  But this was a sign of hope for the rainbow nation.
*21:13.580- 21:20.480* :  Just as it was when the team first won the World Cup in 1995 and were congratulated by Nelson Mandela,
*21:21.140- 21:25.280* :  who had won the country's first multiracial elections a year earlier.
*21:26.000- 21:33.720* :  In an interview with the BBC in 2015, the South African captain François Pina recalled that moment.
*21:34.380- 21:38.120* :  When I walked up onto the podium and was the Mandela as to Garis,
*21:38.340- 21:42.060* :  he said to me, and I still can't believe today that he said it.
*21:42.060- 21:44.440* :  He said, thank you, François, for what you've done for this country.
*21:45.100- 21:46.820* :  I wanted to jump over and give him a hug.
*21:47.780- 21:51.380* :  But I just said to no sir, thank you for what you've done for this country.
*21:54.220- 22:01.060* :  If he didn't ask or tell the ANC and the black people in South Africa,
*22:01.460- 22:04.640* :  that this is our team, they're playing for us.
*22:04.820- 22:07.980* :  We want team, we want country, embrace them.
*22:08.020- 22:10.300* :  Then we wouldn't have had the support that we've had.
*22:10.920- 22:17.640* :  Later, the bus carrying this year's World Cup winners visited Villa Carzi Street in the township of Soweto,
*22:17.640- 22:24.660* :  the historic centre of resistance to apartheid and home to two Nobel Peace Prize winners,
*22:24.660- 22:28.400* :  Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
*22:29.040- 22:30.360* :  Richard Hamilton with that report.
*22:31.200- 22:34.860* :  To get ahead in the world of politics, you may have some big shoes to fill,
*22:34.980- 22:37.400* :  but if claims on social media to be believed,
*22:37.720- 22:42.720* :  the Republican US presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis is taking that very literally.
*22:42.980- 22:47.000* :  Rumors that the governor of Florida is wearing a height-boosting insoles
*22:47.520- 22:50.340* :  to make him look taller, have spread across the internet,
*22:50.640- 22:52.100* :  something he's so far denied.
*22:52.700- 22:55.820* :  So just how important is height and appearance in politics.
*22:56.380- 23:00.340* :  Raquel Lanieri is a journalist specialising in fashion and culture.
*23:00.800- 23:03.940* :  James Reynolds asks her about the rumours surrounding the Florida governor.
*23:04.600- 23:10.480* :  Based on testimony from cowboy boo to manufacturers and people who know this sort of thing,
*23:10.480- 23:13.700* :  it does seem like he is using lift.
*23:14.440- 23:17.240* :  And he said on a late night talk show that he's not,
*23:17.240- 23:18.840* :  that he just wears regular shoes,
*23:19.380- 23:23.160* :  and he's clearly declining efforts to make him walk around barefoot or in his socks
*23:23.160- 23:24.480* :  to make a point either way.
*23:24.880- 23:28.400* :  But the very fact that we're talking about this shows how important height is.
*23:28.760- 23:29.940* :  He says he's five foot eleven.
*23:30.340- 23:32.120* :  Isn't that good enough to be president?
*23:32.120- 23:33.660* :  Why would he need it to go higher?
*23:34.320- 23:36.320* :  Well, five foot eleven, you are right.
*23:36.320- 23:39.480* :  It's not short, but if you look at the past few presidents,
*23:39.520- 23:43.980* :  I mean Donald Trump, who is DeSantis's main rival right now,
*23:43.980- 23:45.240* :  is six foot three.
*23:46.040- 23:48.900* :  Biden is six foot. Obama was six one.
*23:50.260- 23:54.800* :  The last few presidents we've had have all been on six feet or taller.
*23:55.380- 24:00.660* :  And it is a very uniquely American obsession here.
*24:00.660- 24:08.620* :  I mean, even in just business, they say that an extra inch could make you earn $800 more on your paycheck.
*24:09.740- 24:13.360* :  You study how leaders project power through what they were.
*24:13.580- 24:15.700* :  And of course, our team's been thinking of President Zelensky,
*24:15.760- 24:20.400* :  from wearing anonymous suits to having a beard and wearing military t-shirts.
*24:20.400- 24:24.920* :  How important is that for him and for other politicians informing an image of what they want to convey?
*24:25.380- 24:27.900* :  It is very important, especially nowadays,
*24:27.900- 24:31.300* :  because we live in such an image saturated culture.
*24:31.980- 24:40.400* :  Many people make snap judgments on politicians and other figures based on picture of them on Instagram,
*24:41.360- 24:45.580* :  or a picture of them on Twitter or X, or a picture of them.
*24:45.580- 24:48.940* :  I mean, increase less so now, but in the newspaper.
*24:49.740- 24:52.760* :  I mean, and this is not necessarily a new thing.
*24:52.760- 24:54.560* :  It's just ratcheted up.
*24:54.760- 25:00.380* :  You know, they say that the advent of televised debates here in the U.S.
*25:00.380- 25:05.100* :  was what caused Nurture Nixon, the presidency in 1960,
*25:05.100- 25:10.460* :  because next to a gregarious, charming, handsome,
*25:10.780- 25:18.460* :  Kennedy Nixon looked sweaty, not as commanding.
*25:18.640- 25:20.520* :  You know, they say that the law firm is presidency,
*25:20.520- 25:23.120* :  and optics have been very important.
*25:23.120- 25:25.980* :  But it has been very important since the beginning.
*25:25.980- 25:30.060* :  You know, you think about Louis XIV to war high heels,
*25:30.060- 25:34.460* :  because it was a symbol of power and also,
*25:34.460- 25:40.460* :  because it's signified that he was always ready to crush the enemies of the state with his feet.
*25:40.980- 25:42.100* :  Raquel Lannery.
*25:43.120- 25:47.640* :  Now, the gentle tinkling of cowbells is often associated with Switzerland,
*25:47.800- 25:52.780* :  countrying up images of peaceful pastures with snow-capped mountains in the distance.
*25:52.960- 25:56.340* :  But what if those bells were right outside your bedroom window at night,
*25:56.340- 26:00.420* :  clanging loudly around the next of more than 20 cows depriving you of sleep?
*26:00.820- 26:05.220* :  Well, in a Swiss village, farmers who say they rely on the bells to keep track of their cattle
*26:05.580- 26:07.420* :  are at odds with new commons to the area.
*26:07.700- 26:12.340* :  In true Swiss tradition, they'll be the inevitable village-white vote next month
*26:12.840- 26:15.480* :  aimed at permitting cowbells at all hours.
*26:16.060- 26:20.480* :  Our correspondent in the Swiss capital of Bern, Imogen folks, told us more about the route.
*26:21.140- 26:24.420* :  Well, it's all happening in the little village of Arvang,
*26:24.480- 26:28.200* :  and I've been there. It's a very nice traditional dairy farming village,
*26:28.280- 26:30.780* :  very attractive, helps in the distance.
*26:31.580- 26:36.160* :  It's also a very easy commute to Beyrn Zurich or Basel,
*26:36.200- 26:38.040* :  so there's quite a bit of new housing there.
*26:38.700- 26:42.480* :  Population still small, it's about less than 5,000,
*26:42.480- 26:47.840* :  but some of that new housing is right next to the traditional farmhouses and the cows,
*26:48.220- 26:50.360* :  and in spring and in autumn.
*26:50.920- 26:52.900* :  The cows are outside all the time.
*26:52.900- 26:57.620* :  There's a lot of Swiss law about giving domestic animals as much fresh air as possible,
*26:58.020- 27:00.520* :  and they're wearing their bells day and night,
*27:01.360- 27:08.520* :  and told two of the new incoming families complained to the police, complained to the community.
*27:08.520- 27:12.020* :  The police came to measure the decibel level,
*27:12.940- 27:16.720* :  and from there, long-standing locals, friends with the farmers,
*27:17.340- 27:22.800* :  got really, really angry, and that's what's led to the route that's going on now,
*27:22.800- 27:26.940* :  about this huge debate about what should be done with these bells.
*27:27.200- 27:30.620* :  Yes, there's no laughing matter. Before we go on, I suppose we should hear some of these bells.
*27:36.520- 27:40.180* :  So far from peaceful, for many, you've lived in Switzerland a long time.
*27:40.180- 27:42.500* :  Do the Swiss then want to hold on to their cow bells?
*27:43.000- 27:45.880* :  I think many of them do, but probably many of them,
*27:45.880- 27:48.760* :  unless they've been brought up in this dairy farming tradition,
*27:48.760- 27:53.020* :  don't necessarily want them outside their bedroom windows overnight.
*27:53.020- 27:54.700* :  But they do love them.
*27:54.760- 28:01.000* :  I mean, if you talk to farmers, they'll show you that they've got bells from their grandfathers and great-grandfathers.
*28:01.580- 28:05.020* :  You know, they don't actually need them to track their cattle anymore,
*28:05.020- 28:08.780* :  because up the cows are chipped, but they do love the tradition.
*28:08.880- 28:11.420* :  I mean, if you ever watch a World Cup with Switzerland's playing,
*28:11.500- 28:14.720* :  you'll see that the fans carry cow bells with them.
*28:14.720- 28:18.440* :  That's their kind of identity call sound, if you like.
*28:19.240- 28:22.480* :  But if you live right next one, this has happened to me,
*28:22.500- 28:27.040* :  even in the city of Bern, I used to live on the side of a hill where there was a farm.
*28:27.040- 28:31.980* :  They weren't there all night, but when they came out after being milked in the morning,
*28:31.980- 28:35.500* :  they came charging out with their bells on about six.
*28:36.180- 28:40.460* :  Sometimes, not all the time, it could be quite disturbing.
*28:41.220- 28:44.140* :  Some villages have said no more bells at night.
*28:44.140- 28:49.020* :  Some farmers have just got rid of them, but an awful lot,
*28:49.020- 28:52.160* :  I would say, do still want to keep them.
*28:52.160- 28:56.260* :  And, you know, tourists do like them if they hear them at a distance,
*28:57.080- 28:58.340* :  not right under their windows.
*28:59.140- 29:00.640* :  Imogen folks in Bern.
*29:03.300- 29:04.340* :  And that's all from us for now,
*29:04.460- 29:08.140* :  but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:08.580- 29:12.340* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it,
*29:12.780- 29:14.200* :  you can send us an email.

*29:24.140- 29:26.380* :  This edition was mixed by Pat Sissons,
*29:26.800- 29:28.800* :  and the producer was Oliver Burlow.
*29:29.000- 29:30.660* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*29:30.960- 29:31.620* :  I'm Nick Karaci.
*29:32.180- 29:33.100* :  Until next time, goodbye.
