*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service, with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.860- 00:21.180* :  I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zing Sing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*00:21.440- 00:25.260* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*00:25.260- 00:32.120* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*00:32.120- 00:37.460* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*00:37.460- 00:43.640* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner, but controversially turned against the players
*00:44.160- 00:48.160* :  when Cisnik as well. So is he good, bad or just another billionaire?
*00:48.420- 00:51.840* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*00:58.060- 01:05.240* :  Sports, but not as you know it. Yes, you're good enough. We wish we could take you, but you're a girl.
*01:05.700- 01:10.980* :  Amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service. The rules were holding her back.
*01:11.580- 01:15.880* :  So she would have to rewrite them. Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*01:17.960- 01:20.780* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:23.380- 01:28.940* :  I'm Robin Brandt and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday, the 16th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:29.540- 01:33.160* :  We hear from inside the Gaza hospital raided by Israel's soldiers.
*01:33.180- 01:39.260* :  German police carry out a country-wide operation against suspected Islamists with links to Hezbollah.
*01:39.900- 01:43.680* :  And PepsiCo is being sued by New York State for plastic pollution.
*01:46.480- 01:51.520* :  Also, in this podcast, China and US leaders manage a friendly meeting, but afterwards,
*01:51.520- 01:54.160* :  President Biden calls Xi Jinping a dictator.
*02:02.680- 02:08.520* :  So what do the Chinese make of that? And in a world first, UK authorities approve gene therapy
*02:08.520- 02:10.460* :  treatment to cure blood disorders.
*02:14.920- 02:20.320* :  Israel's military is continuing to search Gaza's biggest hospital more than 24 hours after
*02:20.320- 02:25.380* :  its soldiers raided the Al-Shifa compound in Gaza City. With an hours of the operation,
*02:25.380- 02:29.980* :  the Israel Defence Force released unverified images of weapons and equipment,
*02:29.980- 02:35.860* :  proof it says that Hamas was using it as a command centre. Those are accusations the
*02:35.860- 02:42.420* :  organisation has repeatedly denied. Hamas is regarded as a terrorist group by the US, UK and
*02:42.420- 02:47.880* :  some other governments. The BBC, along with other media organisations, was taken by the Israeli
*02:47.880- 02:53.360* :  army into a small part of the Al-Shifa hospital to see what they'd found. Israeli military
*02:54.140- 02:58.360* :  restrictions meant our correspondent, Lucy Williamson, wasn't allowed to speak to any doctors or
*02:58.360- 03:04.040* :  patients. She described what she saw. We're in an Israeli military vehicle inside the Gaza
*03:04.040- 03:10.760* :  strip now. They're taking us towards Gaza City. This area, we're passing through an area where the
*03:10.760- 03:17.540* :  ground operation first began weeks ago now and since then, the Israeli army has poured its way
*03:17.540- 03:23.920* :  methodically towards Gaza City, towards the gates of the Shifa hospital. And that's where they're
*03:23.920- 03:31.020* :  taking us now. They're still being told to keep our lights off. Are we going this way?
*03:32.640- 03:37.000* :  The Israeli army has been really searching through this hospital. You can see they've had to
*03:37.000- 03:45.360* :  force the door of the MRI room here to get inside. They've been looking for evidence of this being
*03:45.360- 03:52.320* :  a Hamas base, a place where Hamas planned attacks and they say that among the things they've uncovered
*03:52.620- 03:58.220* :  are more than a dozen Kalashnikovs, grenades, personal protective equipment, some of it with
*03:58.820- 04:04.000* :  the Hamas military brigade insignia on it. You can see some of them here hidden under these bags
*04:04.000- 04:09.800* :  of medical supplies. We're also told that there have been laptops found with some information
*04:09.880- 04:17.200* :  about the hostages. They also found some recent files that suggest this may have been a Hamas
*04:17.200- 04:23.260* :  operating base as recently as a few days ago. Lucy Williamson inside Al Shifa hospital. Well,
*04:23.260- 04:27.300* :  Lucy is now back in Jerusalem. I spoke to her and she told me about that visit.
*04:27.880- 04:33.900* :  What we were shown, as we were taken in, was three stashes of weapons and military equipment
*04:33.900- 04:42.360* :  like protective vest and also a map and some military leaflets as well that they say had been hidden
*04:42.900- 04:50.820* :  among the medical equipment in the MRI unit by Hamas. It was relatively limited in terms of what
*04:50.820- 04:57.240* :  Israel believes to be operating from Al Shifa and they acknowledge that. I mean, the Army
*04:57.240- 05:01.900* :  spokesman I spoke to there said it was the tip of the iceberg that the searches throughout the
*05:01.900- 05:06.940* :  hospital were continuing. They only managed to search a relatively small area so far when we
*05:06.980- 05:12.040* :  spoke to them last night. But he was convinced that the tunnels would be found and that the proof
*05:12.680- 05:17.600* :  the world was asking for would be shown. What's it like being at the centre of what some might
*05:17.600- 05:23.160* :  regard as a kind of a propaganda war? I mean, what are the restrictions that were imposed on you
*05:23.160- 05:28.240* :  in terms of that brief in and out under the auspices of the Israeli military? We were taken in by
*05:28.240- 05:34.920* :  the military in armoured military vehicles. We were taken right into the heart of Gaza City,
*05:34.920- 05:38.840* :  of course, which is where Al Shifa was located. Some of the fiercest fighting has happened around
*05:38.840- 05:43.040* :  that hospital in the last few days. It's still very tense. We had to wait inside the military
*05:43.040- 05:48.700* :  vehicle for quite a while while infantry secured the area and we went in under complete darkness
*05:49.260- 05:53.380* :  and then we were taken straight through the compound where displaced people were sheltering
*05:53.380- 05:58.000* :  straight through into the MRI department, which is where they wanted to show us the military
*05:58.000- 06:02.600* :  equipment that they'd found. We weren't able to speak to doctors or patients or anyone else.
*06:02.640- 06:07.480* :  It was a very tense situation. We were surrounded at all times with very heavily armed special
*06:07.480- 06:12.320* :  forces. You said it was in the darkest hours, but Al Shifa itself is this still a functioning
*06:12.320- 06:17.060* :  hospital? Did you see evidence of that? It's difficult to tell. There was light in the
*06:17.240- 06:22.660* :  MRI department that we were in, but of course, now that the Israeli army is there and in control,
*06:22.660- 06:29.060* :  I'm not sure exactly how that has changed the situation. As I say, it was really very dark,
*06:29.060- 06:35.960* :  so it was very difficult to accurately assess exactly what was happening. Because the Israeli
*06:35.960- 06:41.620* :  army has moved through that department that we saw looking for tunnels and looking for military
*06:41.620- 06:46.760* :  equipment there, there was a lot of damage that was caused by the IDF. So again, it can be
*06:46.760- 06:52.660* :  quite difficult to tease out exactly what you're seeing and what's caused it. Lucy Williamson
*06:52.660- 06:58.680* :  in Jerusalem. Next to Germany, where hundreds of police have carried out raids across the country,
*06:58.680- 07:03.520* :  properties suspected of having links to the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah.
*07:04.040- 07:08.160* :  The Islamic Centre in Hamburg was among 54 locations they went to.
*07:08.660- 07:13.440* :  Germany's Interior Minister Nancy Faezer said the operation comes at a time when many Jews
*07:13.440- 07:18.920* :  in Germany feel threatened. Our Berlin correspondent, Demi McGinnis, is following the story.
*07:19.260- 07:23.660* :  Since 6 o'clock this morning, coordinated raids in seven regions right across Germany,
*07:23.660- 07:29.460* :  the main focus was Hamburg. As you say, the Islamic Centre Hamburg, which is an Iranian-funded
*07:30.060- 07:34.560* :  organisation. It's been active in Hamburg since the 1960s. It runs a very large mosque there,
*07:34.560- 07:39.240* :  known as the Blue Mosque in the centre of Hamburg. It's been controversial for quite a while
*07:39.240- 07:43.800* :  really, because there have been lots of calls for this organisation to be investigated. It has
*07:43.800- 07:49.900* :  been under observance by special forces here in Germany and by intelligence. And now we've
*07:49.900- 07:54.860* :  seen major raids. Now all these raids across the country are connected to the organisation,
*07:54.860- 07:59.680* :  the Islamic Centre Hamburg. And the organisation is accused, really, of not only being funded by a
*07:59.680- 08:05.520* :  ram, but spreading Iranian, possibly anti-Semitic ideology and Islamist extremist ideology.
*08:05.600- 08:10.080* :  And the reason why the raids have been carried out across the country is to find out evidence
*08:10.080- 08:15.100* :  where this network is spreading across the country. What we've seen this morning is footage,
*08:15.100- 08:19.780* :  showing officers, police officers carrying out large boxes from the mosque and from other
*08:19.780- 08:25.380* :  locations. And what officials are doing are gathering evidence to possibly ban this organisation.
*08:25.660- 08:29.560* :  Are you able to give us just briefly a bit more evidence or some examples about what
*08:29.560- 08:34.100* :  this centre and those associated with it targeted today is actually accused of doing?
*08:35.320- 08:38.200* :  Well, they haven't actually produced any evidence. I think that's what's very interesting
*08:38.200- 08:43.000* :  about this. And this is why it's such a difficult topic, because the reason why the organisation
*08:43.000- 08:48.800* :  has not been banned, even though it has been seen as controversial, is because so far officials
*08:48.800- 08:53.460* :  say they haven't gathered enough evidence to ban the organisations. Over the last year we have
*08:53.500- 08:59.840* :  seen this interior minister ban a lot of organisations, Islamist extremist organisations, far
*08:59.840- 09:04.020* :  right organisations. This government is a very active government when it comes to fighting
*09:04.020- 09:08.680* :  extremism. And I think it really depends what comes out of today's raids, because on the one hand,
*09:08.680- 09:13.380* :  the mosque itself describes itself as a peace organisation, a religious organisation. I think
*09:13.380- 09:17.820* :  for many Muslims the site of armed police officers going into a mosque is very controversial,
*09:17.820- 09:22.560* :  very potentially upsetting. On the other hand, if there is evidence of extremism, well, the
*09:22.560- 09:26.600* :  government will indeed act. I think we'll probably find that more, at least over the next few days
*09:26.600- 09:32.020* :  really, about what evidence they possibly find. Damien McGinnis speaking to me from Berlin.
*09:33.060- 09:37.920* :  Now the world's second biggest food company, PepsiCo, is being sued by the New York State
*09:37.920- 09:43.580* :  government for plastic pollution along the Buffalo River, with claims it is contaminating the water
*09:43.580- 09:48.920* :  and harming wildlife. According to the lawsuit, PepsiCo is the single largest identifiable
*09:49.020- 09:54.600* :  contributor to the problem. David Waddell has more. New York's Attorney General Leticia James
*09:54.600- 10:00.660* :  oversaw a survey of waste gathered at 13 sites along the river last year. It found that PepsiCo's
*10:00.660- 10:06.720* :  single use plastic packaging was the most significant, comprising 17% of all plastic rubbish.
*10:07.360- 10:12.420* :  McDonald's and Hershey's were amongst the other identifiable brands. The lawsuit alleges that
*10:12.420- 10:17.580* :  microplastics have been detected in the city of Buffalo's drinking water supply, which can cause,
*10:17.580- 10:22.540* :  it said, a wide range of adverse health effects. Pepsi has said it's serious about plastic
*10:22.540- 10:28.280* :  reduction and effective recycling. Now let's go to Russia, the world's largest producer of rough
*10:28.280- 10:34.080* :  diamonds. And so far, they are one of the few major exports still untouched by sanctions imposed
*10:34.080- 10:39.900* :  in response to Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine last year. That is partly because Belgium has
*10:39.900- 10:45.120* :  been keen to protect the city of Antwerp, the diamond capital of the world. But now the European
*10:45.120- 10:51.360* :  Union and the G7 are set to impose a ban on Russia's diamonds. Sophia Batitzer reports on what
*10:51.360- 10:59.260* :  the impact of this will be. I'm in Antwerp's diamond district. The cobblestone streets are
*10:59.260- 11:05.620* :  lined with shops with sparkling jewelry on display. The security cameras everywhere. It's a
*11:05.780- 11:11.680* :  very small area, only about one square mile. You wouldn't think that this is the largest diamond
*11:11.680- 11:18.720* :  district in the world, but more than 80% of all rough diamonds that are mined across the globe
*11:19.220- 11:26.560* :  are traded here. Before the invasion of Ukraine, one in four diamonds traded here came straight
*11:26.560- 11:34.040* :  from Russia. But all that is changing. The EU has just unveiled sanctions banning the import of
*11:34.040- 11:42.340* :  diamonds, mined in Russia, which will affect people like Teryi, who's been a diamond trader
*11:42.340- 11:49.920* :  for more than 30 years. Before the war, half of all his stones came from Russia. How difficult is
*11:49.920- 11:56.280* :  it to stop importing diamonds from Russia and to shift to other places in the world? It takes a
*11:56.280- 12:00.940* :  while to shift your business from one supplier to the other. It gives you a lot of headaches,
*12:00.940- 12:07.940* :  but it's doable. Teryi has been able to switch his imports to a mine in Canada, but some of his
*12:07.940- 12:13.560* :  colleagues have not been so lucky. Some of the companies were very much aligned on their business
*12:13.560- 12:21.160* :  with Russia. It was a very big business and it had to stop. The turnover of some of the companies
*12:21.160- 12:27.840* :  were big traders in Russian diamonds. They went out of business. Critics have long complained that
*12:27.840- 12:33.900* :  importing Russian diamonds is unethical, because much of the money flows straight to the Kremlin.
*12:34.140- 12:38.480* :  Today, there's a direct link between buying Russian diamonds and financing the war in Ukraine.
*12:38.960- 12:44.460* :  Philipp Khenyaks is the director of EPs, a research institute based in Antwerp.
*12:44.780- 12:50.380* :  We think that today Russian diamonds should be considered as conflict diamonds because Russia is
*12:50.380- 12:58.500* :  waging an aggressive war against its neighbor. More than 90% of Russian diamonds are produced by
*12:58.500- 13:06.240* :  a single company called Alrosa. What you can hear are expertly produced glitzy videos of its
*13:06.260- 13:13.140* :  minds. Hate them beneath the Siberian permafrost. This is where a third of the world's diamond
*13:13.140- 13:20.980* :  supply comes from. In the first half of this year, it generated about $2 billion and a lot of that
*13:20.980- 13:28.020* :  cash goes to the Kremlin. Diamonds, they travel and they often get mixed and it's not registered
*13:28.020- 13:33.680* :  what's in the mix. So you end up with a certificate of mixed origin and you cannot tell where they
*13:33.680- 13:39.940* :  come from. And that could make this band tricky to enforce. Some Russian diamonds will still
*13:39.940- 13:45.020* :  enter the European market. I actually don't doubt that, but it will be a big difference. So this
*13:45.020- 13:53.660* :  is a very big first step which will have a big impact. Diamonds are forever. The saying goes,
*13:54.580- 14:00.700* :  well, that may soon no longer be true if those diamonds come from Russia.
*14:04.440- 14:06.320* :  Reporting from Antwerp, Sophia Batitzer.
*14:09.240- 14:14.480* :  Still to come in the Global News podcast is the Mekong, one of Asia's most important water sources
*14:14.780- 14:23.680* :  in crisis. We have children and every morning I need around $5 to get them to school and these days
*14:23.680- 14:37.900* :  I have no income. I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zingsing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad
*14:37.900- 14:42.560* :  Billionaire, we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*14:42.560- 14:49.380* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*14:49.440- 14:54.720* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*14:54.720- 15:00.920* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner, but controversially turned against the players
*15:01.400- 15:05.420* :  once his sneakers were off. So is he good, bad or just another billionaire?
*15:05.680- 15:09.100* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*15:18.180- 15:23.460* :  Picture the scene. You're 12 years old, a talented ice hockey player. But despite your skill on
*15:23.460- 15:28.660* :  the rink, you're not allowed to compete at the highest level of the sport. The reason?
*15:29.460- 15:35.720* :  You're a girl. Amazing sport stories from the BBC World Service tells the story of
*15:35.720- 15:41.200* :  Justine Blaney, the girl who fought to change the rules around mixed sex ice hockey teams in
*15:41.200- 15:46.760* :  Ontario, Canada. Listen now by searching for amazing sport stories wherever you get your BBC
*15:46.760- 15:52.240* :  podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The leaders of the world's two biggest
*15:52.240- 15:57.460* :  economies and arguably most powerful nations have met and they've managed to agree several
*15:57.460- 16:02.480* :  low-level measures to try to improve their relationship. The US President Joe Biden and
*16:02.480- 16:08.860* :  China's Xi Jinping sat down for four hours in San Francisco before a wider meeting of Asia-Pacific
*16:08.860- 16:13.420* :  leaders. The meeting appeared cordial and they agreed to resume military communications.
*16:13.540- 16:19.460* :  There were new restrictions on fentanyl ingredients coming from China and also renewed efforts on
*16:19.460- 16:24.540* :  climate change focused on methane. President Biden spoke to the media after the summit,
*16:24.540- 16:29.940* :  but it's safe to say that China's leader won't like this assessment from Mr. Biden who was asked
*16:52.240- 16:55.920* :  about dictatorships. While our North America editor Sarah Smith said the comments could mar what
*16:55.920- 17:00.480* :  had appeared to be a warming relationship. It was described as being considered really more
*17:00.480- 17:06.140* :  personal than the last time they met one year and one day ago in Bali and they were certainly
*17:06.140- 17:11.920* :  sitting much closer together. There were fewer COVID concerns so they were only cross one table
*17:11.920- 17:18.120* :  from each other instead of isolated at the other side of rooms. It's not ideal when President
*17:18.120- 17:23.040* :  Biden then at the end of a press conference made an off the cuff remark in which he repeated his
*17:23.040- 17:29.440* :  view that President Xi is a dictator. Now that will be read as clear criticism by the Chinese
*17:29.440- 17:35.140* :  and coming after all the months of really careful diplomacy that it took to get these two men
*17:35.140- 17:40.040* :  into the same room together it might not be considered the most diplomatic way of ending it.
*17:40.260- 17:44.700* :  Well that's the view from Washington DC. Let's go to Beijing where our correspondent Stephen
*17:44.700- 17:50.580* :  McDonald is. I spoke to him and asked him how state media in China had responded and in particular
*17:50.580- 17:55.420* :  what reaction there had been to Mr Biden's post meeting description of the country.
*17:56.060- 18:01.820* :  We'll read the dictator comment nothing and I think in a strange way it's not surprising
*18:02.740- 18:07.640* :  in China or the media is controlled by the party and if you want a problem to go away you just
*18:08.380- 18:13.140* :  shut up about it and so I wouldn't be surprised if we see nothing on it. I've not seen anything yet.
*18:13.140- 18:17.700* :  I mean it may well have been I haven't seen a single thing we've been looking but I wouldn't
*18:17.700- 18:23.080* :  be surprised if there's nothing. The portrayal of the whole thing though has been very positive
*18:23.660- 18:29.100* :  and I mean it's all in the adjectives you just got to look at Shinhua's report that referring to
*18:29.100- 18:35.040* :  a picturesque backdrop high stakes meeting a significant rendezvous the most important bilateral
*18:35.040- 18:41.240* :  relationship in the world so they're really talking it up and I suppose it also reflects the fact
*18:41.240- 18:46.480* :  that Xi is not without his own problems at home and so he needed to come away from this with a
*18:47.080- 18:53.360* :  pretty solid outing if you like to read a sure people back at home where the economy is
*18:53.740- 19:01.720* :  a bit sluggish but hopefully by him talking to Xi interaction between the two countries can
*19:01.720- 19:07.160* :  increase and so might the economy's performance. Just quickly Stephen I mean Xi Jinping met with
*19:07.160- 19:10.880* :  very prominent US business leaders as well I think Tim Cook they had a apple among them.
*19:11.420- 19:15.840* :  US investment US companies it's still hugely important for China its economy aren't they?
*19:16.600- 19:21.580* :  Absolutely I mean China says it wants US companies to invest in greater numbers the problem
*19:21.580- 19:26.340* :  though of course has been you know this crackdown that's going on here with due diligence companies
*19:26.340- 19:31.120* :  and the like being raided or not being allowed out of the country and so if you want to invest
*19:31.120- 19:37.460* :  here it can be quite difficult to find out what's going on. The detention of various people there
*19:37.460- 19:43.740* :  is a lot of nervousness amongst foreign business here so conditions not really ideal in terms of
*19:43.740- 19:50.840* :  investment here. Stephen MacDonald in Beijing. Now is your image of Freemasons a secret society
*19:50.840- 19:57.480* :  with strange rituals or a benign charitable organisation? Well it seems the Vatican takes the first
*19:57.500- 20:03.020* :  view Pope Francis has just signed a new document which confirms an existing ban on Catholics
*20:03.020- 20:08.580* :  becoming Freemasons. It comes after a bishop from the Philippines expressed concern about the
*20:08.580- 20:14.040* :  growing number of Catholics in his diocese joining Masonic lodges. Roger Hearings spoke to
*20:14.040- 20:19.860* :  Michael Kelly who is the editor of Irish Catholic News about the church's strong stance on the issue.
*20:20.440- 20:24.920* :  The Catholic Church has always taught that basic principle that Catholicism, Christianity
*20:24.920- 20:30.340* :  is not just one way to God it is the way to God you know it felt a little bit more relaxed
*20:30.400- 20:35.980* :  in the 1960s because at that time the Catholic Church said that a Catholic who joined the Freemasons
*20:35.980- 20:41.840* :  was in grave sin but it was no longer an excommunicable offense so that relaxed it a little bit but
*20:41.840- 20:47.940* :  that was reaffirmed then in 1983 that while it was no longer excommunicable it still was forbidden
*20:47.940- 20:52.220* :  for Catholics to join the Freemasons. But a lot of people would think this is this sounds a bit
*20:52.480- 20:56.960* :  odd because in a lot of places in Britain and I think possibly in Ireland and certainly in the
*20:56.960- 21:02.260* :  United States it's almost like a local club where people go along very often to connect in business
*21:03.280- 21:07.740* :  as much as anything to think of it as being something that offends the Catholic Church seems
*21:07.740- 21:12.220* :  quite strange. No indeed and I think that's very much the case in the English speaking sphere.
*21:12.560- 21:18.140* :  But I think if you look in the French context and especially the Italian context there's a lot more
*21:18.140- 21:25.600* :  conspiratorial thoughts around Freemasonry and particularly of one looks at the Vatican if I can
*21:25.820- 21:31.560* :  cast our minds back to 1982 and the death of Roberto Calvi in London who was found
*21:31.560- 21:37.500* :  hanged at Black Friars Bridge which for all intensive purposes looked like a suicide but
*21:37.500- 21:43.660* :  coroners later reported that they thought it was a murder. Calvi was known as God's Banker. Calvi
*21:43.660- 21:50.680* :  was involved in the collapse of the Banka Ambrosiano which the Vatican Bank was involved in the
*21:50.680- 21:57.400* :  ownership of as well and ended up in the 1980s having to pay creditors over 200 million US dollars.
*21:57.400- 22:04.320* :  So there was a branch of the Masonic order in Italy known as a propaganda duet or a P2 and
*22:04.320- 22:09.360* :  Calvi was tied up with that and there were all kinds of allegations about an involvement there
*22:09.360- 22:15.420* :  in the Vatican Bank and trying to discredit the Vatican. So as a result of that Italian ecclesiastical
*22:15.420- 22:22.220* :  culture is much more live to concerns around Freemasonry and concerns around the secret nature of it
*22:22.220- 22:27.440* :  and the ritualistic nature of it and we would be used to in English-speaking countries where again
*22:27.440- 22:32.780* :  most people see it as a charitable organization that gathers together to risk funds for good causes
*22:32.780- 22:38.060* :  and okay it's probably worthwhile for people in terms of business context but no one sees it as
*22:38.060- 22:42.380* :  anything particularly sinister. And I suppose you know this came out a gather from an inquiry from
*22:42.380- 22:48.520* :  the Philippines church this reassertion of the doctrine but I mean how can I see problems with
*22:48.520- 22:53.740* :  Catholics I guess in the US you may not even be aware of this and perhaps an island perhaps in the
*22:53.740- 22:58.900* :  UK as well. Well this is one of the challenges and I think what's going on in the Philippines is as
*22:58.900- 23:04.600* :  the country becomes more upwardly mobile and Catholics become more influential in business they
*23:04.600- 23:09.620* :  see something like Freemasonry or the other Masonic orders or something that's worthwhile to join
*23:09.620- 23:15.760* :  for business purposes and I think the challenge for the Catholic church around this is very very
*23:15.760- 23:21.720* :  few people join the Freemasons for religious reasons so I think probably some Catholics who
*23:21.720- 23:27.120* :  may be Freemasons will probably find themselves as surprised that they find themselves today on
*23:27.120- 23:31.200* :  the wrong side of the church on the issue quite precisely because they don't see it they don't
*23:31.200- 23:36.160* :  view it as a religious experience they view it as a kind of a club where they meet like-minded people.
*23:36.840- 23:41.980* :  Michael Kelly there is fresh evidence of the environmental crisis facing the Mekong River
*23:41.980- 23:48.360* :  one of the most important water sources in Asia the river flows for almost 5,000 kilometers
*23:48.360- 23:53.700* :  from the Tibetan Plateau and China down to Vietnam communities living downstream in Cambodia
*23:53.700- 24:00.500* :  report a drastic drop in fish stocks in one area and as Laura Bicca reports from Cambodia they
*24:00.500- 24:09.580* :  think decades of dam building and dredging is to blame. It's early morning at a market on the edge
*24:09.580- 24:17.600* :  of Tonle Sap Lake and the boats are bringing in lots of fish from tiny silver slithery fish to river
*24:17.600- 24:24.280* :  prawns all being shoved into different baskets and brought up the hill this fish is vital to the
*24:24.320- 24:29.860* :  diet of people who live here about 70% of the protein that they eat is fish.
*24:33.000- 24:38.420* :  The Tonle Sap is fed by the Mekong fish flow down the river and into the lake
*24:38.420- 24:44.960* :  the largest known fish migration on the planet but in recent years communities have been asking
*24:45.700- 24:56.820* :  where are they? These past few years there is less and less water and fewer and fewer fish.
*24:59.000- 25:06.940* :  And with 38-year-old Mai he's a fisherman plunging himself into the water as he untangles his net.
*25:09.400- 25:17.760* :  We have children and every morning I need around $5 to get them to school and these days I have no income.
*25:19.880- 25:25.240* :  To find out why the fish are not making it downstream we need to travel north.
*25:28.240- 25:33.480* :  I'm standing on the shoreline of northern Cambodia in the shade as the sun is beginning to beat down
*25:34.520- 25:40.640* :  and the border is of course the Mekong River and across the vast river there is one structure that
*25:40.640- 25:48.760* :  stands out completely. It is the Don Sahong Dam. Since the 1990s some have eyed the Mekong as a
*25:48.760- 25:55.400* :  potentially powerful energy resource. China has built 11 hydroelectric dams on the mainstream.
*25:55.420- 26:03.440* :  Lose has two dozens more are planned. Climate change and dams are working together to
*26:03.440- 26:09.080* :  deliver a death of a thousand cuts to the Mekong system. Brian Eile from the Stimson Center
*26:09.080- 26:15.740* :  think tank in Washington DC monitors the amount of water in the dams. Rainfall that typically would
*26:15.740- 26:22.460* :  fall during the wet season is much lower than normal but at the same time upstream dams are
*26:22.460- 26:27.920* :  restricting water during that wet season so that's bringing the pulse and bringing river flows
*26:27.920- 26:35.960* :  down much lower than they need to be. But there is some hope. Just south of the Don Sahong Dam in
*26:35.960- 26:42.700* :  Cambodia's Stung Trang Province the river has new guardians. A group of teenagers are sacrificing
*26:42.700- 26:53.680* :  their sleep for the sake of the Mekong. These young guardians can do little to protest
*26:53.680- 26:59.900* :  dam building upstream nor can they slow the pace of climate change but they can still
*26:59.900- 27:05.280* :  do something to stop the use of dynamite or electrician to kill hundreds of fish.
*27:08.540- 27:12.980* :  If those illegal fishing activities increase there will be no fish for the next generation.
*27:14.040- 27:19.240* :  There is now a call for governments in this region to work together to monitor water levels
*27:19.240- 27:27.060* :  and dam construction. The flow of this mighty river has not yet been stilled but its fate now
*27:27.060- 27:33.760* :  depends on the resilience of the people it supports and how far they're willing to go to defend it.
*27:35.660- 27:41.020* :  Laura Bicker reporting from by the Mekong in Cambodia and to hear Laura's full report the
*27:41.020- 27:46.360* :  mighty Mekong's last hope search the documentary wherever you get your BBC podcasts from.
*27:47.480- 27:51.800* :  Now we end on some positive news for the many thousands of people suffering from sickle cell
*27:51.800- 27:57.620* :  disease or beta thalassemia. Health authorities here in the UK have become the first in the world
*27:57.620- 28:03.540* :  to approve gene therapy that is hoped to eventually cure these two inherited conditions which
*28:03.540- 28:07.720* :  can be fatal. Michelle Roberts the Health Federer of the BBC News website told me more.
*28:33.020- 28:39.000* :  People might have needed a whole bow marrow transplant so you've got to find a good match a person
*28:39.000- 28:44.960* :  who can donate and there's concerns about rejection too. So this new treatment is quite exciting
*28:45.000- 28:48.820* :  because you can take your own cells and just tweak them and make them healthy again.
*28:49.160- 28:53.220* :  And we heard Fergus Walsh a colleague of yours a little earlier saying that the test show very
*28:53.220- 28:58.160* :  high success rates it really is quite impressive. It is I mean we're still talking early days here so
*28:58.160- 29:04.080* :  we've had fewer than 100 people who started to try out this therapy in trials. Some of them have
*29:04.080- 29:08.520* :  got sickle cell disease. Other ones have beta thalassemia both are conditions that affect your
*29:08.520- 29:14.940* :  red blood cells and their ability to carry oxygen. So it is looking really promising. The other
*29:14.940- 29:20.460* :  thing to know is it's sort of not really quick and easy. These patients had to spend about a month
*29:20.460- 29:25.680* :  in hospital. It's quite an intensive treatment and it's very expensive. I was going to say I've seen
*29:25.680- 29:31.680* :  some figures which are frankly mind blowing. Yeah I mean we don't know the actual cost. Nobody's
*29:31.900- 29:38.560* :  confirmed how much but we're talking hundreds of thousands possibly a million so it's not cheap
*29:38.560- 29:44.280* :  but then when you look at these conditions so sickle cell is quite common. It's something that you
*29:44.280- 29:50.940* :  inherit and you throughout life can have a lot of complications with it so you can see why
*29:50.940- 29:56.700* :  one-off treatment if this does give you long-term protection would be really desirable.
*29:57.300- 30:03.220* :  Michelle Roberts. That is all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News

*30:40.460- 30:45.740* :  how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire. Considered the NBA's greatest
*30:45.740- 30:51.040* :  player of all time he earned almost a hundred million dollars playing basketball. But that is
*30:51.040- 30:56.660* :  nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions. And he made
*30:56.660- 31:03.700* :  his real money as an NBA team owner but controversially turned against the players once his sneakers were off.
*31:03.840- 31:09.260* :  So is he good bad or just another billionaire? To find out listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever
