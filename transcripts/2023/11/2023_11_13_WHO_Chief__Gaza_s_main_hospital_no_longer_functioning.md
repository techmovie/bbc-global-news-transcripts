*01:18.660- 01:23.500* :  And Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Monday the 13th of November, these are our main
*01:23.500- 01:28.680* :  stories. There are growing international concerns about what's being described as a
*01:28.680- 01:33.900* :  dire and perilous situation at Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital. But Israel insists,
*01:34.580- 01:39.340* :  there is electricity in Shifa, everything is operating. We're speaking to the managers,
*01:39.340- 01:44.360* :  we haven't gone into Shifa and the underneath Shifa, there's a huge telebase.
*01:44.960- 01:48.740* :  This doctor at another hospital in Gaza says there have been further strikes.
*01:49.300- 01:54.360* :  Another bribe with Obestetric Hospital was targeted directly today and two of our colleagues
*01:54.360- 01:58.280* :  were our specialists in Obestetric and Gallopology where killed tonight.
*01:58.960- 02:02.760* :  In Paris, a huge march has held against anti-semitism.
*02:04.620- 02:09.580* :  Also in this podcast, a search and rescue operation is underway in the Indian Himalayas
*02:09.580- 02:15.860* :  to rescue workers trapped in a tunnel. And in Scotland, here is an unusual film of recent years
*02:15.860- 02:22.120* :  for it proves the existence of a monster in Loch Nair. A famous mystery marks a milestone.
*02:27.140- 02:32.280* :  The head of the World Health Organization says the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza is no longer
*02:32.280- 02:37.920* :  functioning. Tedros Adalam Geber Yeses described the situation as dire and perilous.
*02:38.080- 02:43.720* :  His comments come as health officials there say thousands of people remain trapped in Al-Shifa,
*02:43.720- 02:48.800* :  the territory's biggest hospital. Doctors say premature babies are in danger
*02:49.220- 02:53.260* :  and have had to be taken out of incubators because electricity has been cut.
*02:54.020- 02:58.260* :  Hamas is reported to be breaking off negotiations over the release of hostages
*02:58.680- 03:01.900* :  because of the Israeli military actions around the hospital.
*03:02.620- 03:08.100* :  At the NASA hospital in Cannes, in southern Gaza, Dr. Muhammad Cannes deals said hospitals
*03:08.100- 03:14.800* :  had again been targeted on Sunday. Another bribe of a citric hospital was targeted directly
*03:14.800- 03:20.520* :  today and to our colleague, our specialist in a citric and gynecology work held tonight.
*03:20.860- 03:27.480* :  Five kids in the pediatric ICU left alone in the Hrentisa hospital and we don't know what's
*03:27.480- 03:32.060* :  going on with them. The communication where lost them might be dead or alive.
*03:32.860- 03:35.520* :  Officials say two other hospitals in Gaza City,
*03:35.520- 03:40.900* :  Al-Naza and Rantizi have been evacuated and evacuees have been left out on the streets
*03:40.900- 03:46.440* :  without any treatment. The Palestinian Red Crescent, which administers Al-Quds Hospital,
*03:46.440- 03:52.360* :  said it too, has had to close its doors to patients. This spokesperson is Nebel Fassak.
*03:52.660- 03:59.740* :  Huzon, Alam, Rados, Sorrow, Pian, Anger, Discontent and Disappointment. These are our feelings today
*03:59.740- 04:05.560* :  after we had to announce Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City is out of service. The hospital was left
*04:05.560- 04:10.920* :  to face its destiny on its own under continuous bombardment, which put the lives of our medical
*04:10.920- 04:16.800* :  staff and patients in danger. The Israeli Defense Force says it doesn't target hospitals
*04:16.800- 04:23.040* :  and officials have repeatedly denied striking Al-Shifa. Here's the Israeli President Isaac
*04:23.040- 04:29.040* :  Herzog talking to the BBC on Sunday. There's a lot of spin by Hamas, but there is electricity
*04:29.040- 04:35.000* :  in Shifa. Everything is operating. We're speaking to the managers. We haven't gone into Shifa.
*04:35.540- 04:41.980* :  We're unfortunately underneath Shifa. There's a huge, huge terror base. The headquarters
*04:42.060- 04:50.320* :  of Hamas, ISIS, operations is right there under Shifa. So what is going on? A correspondent
*04:50.320- 04:56.200* :  in Jerusalem is Paul Adams. We don't know very much, as you say. It very, very contradictory
*04:56.200- 05:03.480* :  statements. But I think what we do know is that Shifa is an absolutely central target in Israel's
*05:03.480- 05:09.920* :  military campaign. It believes that there is this significant Hamas structure underneath the hospital.
*05:09.920- 05:15.940* :  And that is why for several days we have seen Israeli forces camped outside. They basically want
*05:15.940- 05:22.600* :  everyone to leave. We're reaching a really defining point here where the Israelis are going to have
*05:22.600- 05:29.700* :  to decide whether it is worth their strategic objectives to continue to lay siege to a hospital
*05:30.240- 05:34.100* :  when the conditions inside are becoming catastrophic. Now, these Israelis say that they have
*05:34.440- 05:39.920* :  tried to get fuel into the hospital. They say they took 300 liters to a nearby road junction
*05:39.920- 05:45.480* :  last night, but that fuel was not taken. And they believe that Hamas have prevented that because
*05:45.480- 05:50.900* :  they think that Hamas are trying to deliberately worsen the situation inside. But there's a real
*05:50.900- 05:58.520* :  kind of tussle of wills over Shifa hospital. And it is reaching a really dire critical point,
*05:58.520- 06:02.780* :  I think. Well, interesting. You say that because we've adjusted the statement from the international
*06:02.780- 06:08.680* :  committee of the Red Cross warning of a disaster in Gaza. Will that pile more pressure on the Israelis?
*06:09.060- 06:13.780* :  I think so. It's an incredibly strongly worded statement from the ICRC. They say an unbearable
*06:13.780- 06:18.860* :  human tragedy is unfolding in front of our eyes. They talk about people having to flee,
*06:18.860- 06:25.240* :  walking past dead bodies, families being separated, and completely inadequate provision of aid
*06:25.240- 06:32.680* :  in the South, where at least 100,000 displaced people who lack food, shelter, water, and hygiene.
*06:32.780- 06:38.840* :  So they are painting the bleakest possible picture of the situation in the Gaza Strip as a whole,
*06:38.840- 06:43.060* :  not just in the North, but also in the South. And when you couple that with some of the comments
*06:43.060- 06:48.800* :  that are starting to come from Washington, you begin to get a sense now of a real sense of
*06:48.800- 06:55.140* :  international disquiet about the sheer human cost of Israel's campaign against Hamas.
*06:55.660- 07:01.180* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Tens of thousands of people across France have been marching against
*07:01.180- 07:07.340* :  anti-semitism. In Paris, they stood to attention as they sang the national anthem the Marciers.
*07:15.600- 07:19.840* :  The event follows a marked increase in attacks on the Jewish community in the country,
*07:20.320- 07:24.860* :  some 1200 over the last four weeks since the start of the conflict in Gaza.
*07:25.540- 07:31.820* :  It was boycotted by the fire leftist pro-Israel, but the far-rights Marine Le Pen did attend.
*07:31.820- 07:36.480* :  A correspondent who's scurfield is in Paris and told me about the demonstration.
*07:37.260- 07:42.160* :  Tens and tens of thousands crowded across the left bank on the way to the Senate building.
*07:42.700- 07:46.360* :  Jews, of course, were out there in force, but many non-Jews too, and this is crucial,
*07:46.360- 07:50.820* :  because Jews have had their own demonstrations since the start of all of this,
*07:50.980- 07:55.560* :  but they were rather upset that the demonstrations that they had to condemn the attacks of
*07:55.560- 07:59.820* :  October 7th and so on were attended mainly by Jews, and that there wasn't much of a kind of
*07:59.820- 08:04.420* :  national rallying round, whereas today there was much more of a national rallying around.
*08:04.720- 08:09.820* :  But interesting who was there and who wasn't there, because it's the first time that a big
*08:09.820- 08:15.280* :  demonstration in France included the far-right, isn't it? Very significant this. It's not as if
*08:15.400- 08:20.320* :  Marine Le Pen and the far-right sort of welcomed in, but her presence there was accepted,
*08:20.320- 08:24.960* :  I mean, the vast majority of people I spoke to feeling that, well, she's out there attacking
*08:24.960- 08:31.620* :  anti-Semitism, defending Jews. Yes, her party has a terrible past, and yes, her father was condemned
*08:31.620- 08:36.320* :  for saying the Holocaust was a detailed history and so on, but we recognise that things have changed,
*08:36.620- 08:41.900* :  and now she's quite clearly lining up with us. And what about the president in Manuoma
*08:41.900- 08:46.740* :  Crom, because he spoke, didn't he, on the eve of the marches? Yeah, he did. He gave an interview
*08:46.740- 08:52.260* :  to the BBC on Friday. He used some quite strong language about Israel talking about the bombings
*08:52.260- 08:56.740* :  of women and babies. He's taken the decision that it wasn't his play, he said, I'm with you in
*08:56.740- 09:02.300* :  spirit, because he was under attack from parts of the French body politics, shall we say, for being
*09:02.300- 09:07.840* :  very strongly pro-Israel, being of all of this, and maybe he's having to balance it out a bit by
*09:08.180- 09:12.980* :  making noises which aren't quite so pro-Israeli at the moment, but there's no question that
*09:12.980- 09:16.840* :  he's got ease with for people on the march today, as are the whole of the kind of political
*09:16.840- 09:22.840* :  spectrum broadly speaking is. He's co-filled in Paris. Well, as Hugh mentioned there, in an interview
*09:22.840- 09:28.680* :  on Friday with the BBC, President Manuoma Crom said there was no justification for the bombing
*09:28.680- 09:35.320* :  of civilians, and called for a ceasefire in Gaza. On Saturday, the leaders of 57 Arab and Muslim
*09:35.320- 09:41.420* :  countries condemned Israel's military action in Gaza, as well as its Western backers, and they
*09:41.420- 09:47.480* :  also called for a ceasefire. And the attitude of the US seems to be changing. Listen to these
*09:47.480- 09:52.400* :  recent comments from America's top diplomat, the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken.
*10:04.480- 10:10.260* :  The US is Israel's most important ally, and Anthony Blinken's comments raise the question
*10:10.540- 10:15.240* :  of whether Washington is wavering over the way Israel is prosecuting the war in Gaza.
*10:16.000- 10:21.380* :  Anthony Zaka, our senior North America reporter, has been tracing the trajectory of what looks
*10:21.380- 10:28.100* :  increasingly like a shift away from President Biden's initial rock-solid support for Israel,
*10:28.100- 10:33.220* :  following the, toward the Seventh Attacks, when Hamas murdered 1200 Israelis.
*10:33.780- 10:39.180* :  The United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back.
*10:39.260- 10:45.520* :  In the following days, a more nuanced American response began to take shape. While the US
*10:45.520- 10:50.960* :  continued to advocate for Israel's right to self-defense, it counseled the nation's leaders to
*10:50.960- 10:57.280* :  be measured in their response. Mr. Biden drew parallels to the US actions after the 11th September
*10:57.280- 11:03.180* :  attack on the World Trade Center, and advised that the Israelis learn from what he said were his
*11:11.600- 11:19.720* :  nation's mistakes. The Americans warned that the Israeli military campaign in Gaza must be
*11:19.720- 11:25.980* :  crafted in a way that abided by the rules of war, minimized civilian casualties, and avoided
*11:25.980- 11:32.540* :  what had the potential to be a humanitarian crisis. These words of advice have become increasingly
*11:32.540- 11:39.000* :  pointed as the Israeli campaign unfolded, and the civilian deaths and human suffering became
*11:39.000- 11:45.120* :  apparent. As Israel conduct its campaign, how it does it matter? Israel must take every possible
*11:45.120- 11:49.740* :  measure to prevent civilian casualties. At first, the Americans pushed the Israelis to reopen the
*11:49.740- 11:55.560* :  southern border crossing into Gaza and allow humanitarian aid trucks to enter. Once this was
*11:55.560- 12:01.480* :  accomplished, over initial Israeli resistance, the US turned its attention to so-called temporary
*12:01.480- 12:07.780* :  humanitarian pauses in the Israeli offensive to allow for the better distribution of aid and for
*12:07.780- 12:13.480* :  civilians to flee areas of having fighting. This was one of the primary goals of Secretary of State
*12:13.480- 12:19.000* :  Anthony Blinken's recent trip to the Middle East, and the Israelis initially rejected that proposal
*12:19.000- 12:25.220* :  out of hand as well. The Americans kept pressing, however, and by the end of this week, daily pauses
*12:25.220- 12:31.200* :  in the fighting were being implemented. This then is the heart of the US strategy with Israel
*12:31.700- 12:37.240* :  to temper support with pressure, directing the Israeli response in Gaza in a way the Americans
*12:37.240- 12:43.640* :  find appropriate. It's a balancing act, and one that risks angry in Israel's Arab neighbors
*12:43.640- 12:49.440* :  who are demanding a total and immediate ceasefire. Mr. Blinken received just such an earful
*12:49.740- 12:54.580* :  during his recent stop in Amman, Jordan, where he sat down with a group of Arab foreign ministers
*12:54.580- 13:02.160* :  last Saturday. This war is just going to produce small pain for Palestinians for Israelis,
*13:02.160- 13:06.460* :  and this is going to push us all again into the abyss of hatred and be humanization.
*13:06.960- 13:12.940* :  The American strategy also has domestic political ramifications for Mr. Biden. Members of his own
*13:12.940- 13:19.580* :  party are becoming increasingly unhappy with what they see as his uncritical support for Israel,
*13:19.580- 13:23.720* :  and an insufficient concern for Palestinian civilian casualties.
*13:24.040- 13:28.740* :  I'm the only Palestinian American serving in Congress, Mr. Chair, and the refusal of Congress
*13:28.740- 13:33.400* :  and the administration to acknowledge Palestinian lives as chipping out way at my soul. We will continue
*13:33.400- 13:38.140* :  to call for a ceasefire, Mr. Chair, for the immediate delivery of critical humanitarian aid to Gaza,
*13:38.140- 13:41.900* :  for the release of all hostages, and for every American to come home.
*13:42.240- 13:47.260* :  As the death toll rises, the President standing at home risks further erosion.
*13:47.760- 13:54.120* :  Anthony Zirka, a search and rescue operation is ongoing to reach as many as 40 construction workers
*13:54.560- 13:58.780* :  trapped in a tunnel which collapsed on Sunday morning in the Indian Himalayas.
*13:59.140- 14:04.080* :  I got more details from our correspondent to Dil Nawaz Pasha, who's in the Indian capital, Delhi.
*14:04.500- 14:08.200* :  Officials are trying to use equipment to cut through the surface to reach there,
*14:08.200- 14:12.120* :  but those equipment will arrive in the morning. As of now, there are more than 100
*14:12.120- 14:18.060* :  personal of different rescue units working on the ground. As of the latest statement from the
*14:18.060- 14:23.300* :  officials, they believe the workers inside are safe. They have sent messages to them, but have
*14:23.300- 14:29.400* :  not received any response as of now. They have also installed an additional oxygen pipe to make
*14:29.400- 14:34.040* :  sure that they have enough oxygen. The official heading the operation says that they believe
*14:34.040- 14:40.020* :  the workers are safe and there is no high risk to their health. But with the debris as we know
*14:40.020- 14:46.360* :  from the officials is that it's 25 to 50 meters thick. So it will be really hard to remove this
*14:46.520- 14:50.940* :  in the shortest span of time that the workers might have there. This is not the first time a tunnel
*14:50.940- 14:56.340* :  has collapsed landslides during the rainy season are common. These are sedimentary rocks through
*14:56.340- 15:01.800* :  which this tunnel was cut through. This is a very sensitive ecological geographically area.
*15:02.140- 15:07.960* :  And as of now what we are told, it was the sediments that came down and this is not something
*15:07.960- 15:11.820* :  new or surprising considering the ecological situation in the region.
*15:12.220- 15:16.740* :  And why were they building the tunnel? The government is working on an ambitious
*15:16.740- 15:22.700* :  all-weather road. Travel there is difficult to do to the conditions. So the government wants to
*15:22.700- 15:27.640* :  connect most of the Hindu religious sites in the Malin region to increase domestic tourism
*15:27.640- 15:34.160* :  and also the religious tourism. Dinoa's Pasha, even though the 16th century poached
*15:35.100- 15:40.900* :  explorer Ferdinand Magellan never has circumnavigated the globe and in fact died during an expedition
*15:40.900- 15:47.840* :  he certainly left his mark. The Magellan Straits are named after him as a couple of giant telescopes.
*15:47.900- 15:54.280* :  There are also the large and small Magellan clouds which are two satellite galaxies of the Milky Way.
*15:54.940- 16:01.580* :  Now some astronomers want Magellan's name removed. Astronomer Mier de la Reyes from Amherst
*16:01.580- 16:07.200* :  College in Massachusetts is one of them. She told Julian Marshall first about the clouds.
*16:07.720- 16:13.840* :  The Milky Way has a host of smaller satellite galaxies surrounding it and the two most massive
*16:13.840- 16:19.000* :  satellites are the large and small Magellanic clouds. They're visible by eye in the southern hemisphere.
*16:19.260- 16:24.080* :  Indigenous communities have known about them well before Western astronomers ever recorded them.
*16:24.400- 16:29.400* :  He was the person who began the voyage that circumnavigated the globe and along the way one of the
*16:29.520- 16:34.400* :  many things that was recorded were these two blobs in the night sky. These things that looked a
*16:34.400- 16:38.440* :  bit like clouds and so they eventually became known colloquially as the Magellanic clouds.
*16:38.700- 16:42.840* :  It is worth noting that this expedition was certainly not the first to even record these. There
*16:42.840- 16:47.400* :  had been Western explorers and Arabic explorers prior to Magellan where they're written records
*16:47.400- 16:52.960* :  of these clouds. They were just known as the clouds and astronomers had a Latin scientific name
*16:52.960- 16:58.260* :  for them, not a Neubecula major and Neubecula minor. As Latin fell out of favor the colloquial term
*16:58.260- 17:05.340* :  began taking over. But you and other astronomers want to get rid of Magellan from these galaxies.
*17:05.740- 17:11.100* :  In astronomy renaming things to honor scientific credit that's not uncommon. The night sky is for
*17:11.100- 17:16.640* :  everyone and if that's the case then we can perhaps do better than naming these galaxies in the sky
*17:16.640- 17:20.660* :  but people around the world have known about for a long time. We can do better than naming them
*17:20.660- 17:26.200* :  after somebody who not only didn't discover them and you had a complicated legacy for
*17:26.200- 17:32.120* :  it and Magellan was sailing on behalf of the Spanish crown and his journey paved the way for
*17:32.120- 17:37.200* :  Spanish colonization. He doesn't really deserve the scientific credit for these galaxies and
*17:37.200- 17:42.500* :  Magellan in particular was sort of a reprehensible character even at the time. There are records
*17:42.500- 17:47.620* :  along his journey of him enslaving and murdering indigenous communities in multiple locations
*17:47.620- 17:53.180* :  around the globe. What do we call these Magellanic clouds from from now on or what do you think we
*17:53.420- 17:57.220* :  should? That's a great question so it's one that astronomers are discussing right now so some
*17:57.220- 18:03.100* :  folks have suggested Milky or Milky Way to retain the association of these galaxies with the Milky
*18:03.100- 18:08.220* :  Way because they're satellite galaxies of our Milky Way or naming them something like the large
*18:08.220- 18:13.080* :  meridional cloud or the small meridional cloud so meridional here means associated with the
*18:13.080- 18:16.700* :  southern hemisphere so it would be a more accurate descriptor of what these galaxies actually are.
*18:23.980- 18:29.660* :  I did an audition for Clive Davis and I played him it never rains and I gave it to the sea
*18:29.660- 18:35.300* :  curves I gave it to Glenn Campbell they told me oh it's a terrible song I played him that one
*18:35.300- 18:39.120* :  and he said that's going to be your single and that's going to be the title of the album.
*18:39.620- 18:47.160* :  The award winning singer and songwriter Albert Hammond on success and his latest album at 79.
*18:50.840- 18:56.300* :  Demonstrations have taken place in cities across Spain against a plan to grant amnesties to
*18:56.300- 19:01.740* :  leading Catalan separatists in exchange for supporting a new term for the socialist-led
*19:01.740- 19:07.240* :  government. Tens of thousands gathered in Madrid for the biggest protest called by the centre-right
*19:07.240- 19:12.420* :  people's party with the support of the far-right Vox party Danny Eberhardt reports.
*19:18.220- 19:25.260* :  Constitution, no to the amnesty, yes to Spain, Long live Spain. Madrid's regional head is a
*19:25.260- 19:31.420* :  bell-de-affayuso set for tone. A huge crowd of people, many waving the red and yellow of Spain's
*19:31.420- 19:36.680* :  national flag, had packed the city's Puerto del Sol but there were protests elsewhere too,
*19:37.120- 19:42.840* :  including in the Catalan capital Barcelona. The demonstrators' eye was directed in part
*19:42.840- 19:48.780* :  at acting Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. Posters labeled him a traitor for a deal they believe
*19:48.780- 19:57.320* :  undermines the unity of Spain and the rule of law. Protesters demanded jail for both him and for
*19:57.320- 20:03.820* :  Carlos Cruz de Mon, the man who led a failed bid for Catalan independence in 2017. He's currently
*20:03.820- 20:09.460* :  an exile in Belgium but stands to benefit from the proposed amnesty. The leader of the people's
*20:09.580- 20:17.220* :  party Alberto Núñez Fejero denounced the deal. Spain is going to have a Prime Minister who's
*20:17.220- 20:22.600* :  brought his investiture and exchange for the impunity of his associates, paid for by the taxes
*20:22.600- 20:27.640* :  of the Spanish people. This is what's happening in Spain, nothing more, nothing less.
*20:27.980- 20:32.680* :  The Socialists hope the deal will secure stable governance over a four-year term,
*20:32.680- 20:37.720* :  avoiding the need for new elections. They may have stitched together enough votes in Parliament
*20:37.720- 20:43.000* :  for Mr Sánchez to win an investiture vote, expected later this week, but it's come at the cost
*20:43.000- 20:51.240* :  of renewed polarisation. Daniel Bajard, the unraveling of a drug trafficking operation through Vietnam,
*20:51.240- 20:58.080* :  has led to 18 people being sentenced to death. They include two South Korean men, one a former
*20:58.080- 21:04.180* :  police officer. Aresia Pacific editor Celia Hatton spoke to Alex Risen. This really was a big
*21:04.180- 21:10.000* :  operation, Alex. I mean, 18 people sentenced to death, two South Koreans, and a Chinese man,
*21:10.000- 21:16.120* :  and also four others who were given lengthy prison sentences, including a teenager. So in July
*21:16.120- 21:21.720* :  of 2020, police discovered a shipping container they thought seemed a little suspicious. It was
*21:21.720- 21:28.080* :  bound for South Korea. Inside were slabs of marble that were meant to be used as countertops,
*21:28.360- 21:35.280* :  and inside there they found 40 kilograms of crystal meth bound for South Korea. That led them to
*21:35.480- 21:41.720* :  unravel this drug operation, which was led by a Vietnamese man, and they found that over two
*21:41.720- 21:47.340* :  months this operation had been bringing in drugs that were producing Cambodia, carrying them through
*21:47.340- 21:53.160* :  Vietnam, and then sending them to other destinations mostly South Korea. So a really big operation,
*21:53.160- 21:57.780* :  but it's taken quite a few years for the Vietnamese government to put it through the courts.
*21:58.000- 22:02.360* :  Vietnam, a big user of the death sentence. That's right. One of the biggest in the world we think.
*22:02.360- 22:07.800* :  It's funny, Alex, because they'll sort of make very vague notices in the state media that someone
*22:07.800- 22:11.840* :  has been sentenced to death, but they don't really say much more else about the case. It's a very
*22:11.840- 22:17.500* :  closed court system in Vietnam, but they're coming under more scrutiny. They have actually changed
*22:17.500- 22:22.600* :  the mode of the death penalty. They used to use a firing squad, but in 2013, they've replaced that
*22:22.620- 22:28.040* :  by death by injection. How bad is drug trafficking in Vietnam and in the region?
*22:28.040- 22:34.180* :  It's getting a lot worse in Vietnam in particular. Drugs used to flow through what was known as
*22:34.180- 22:40.660* :  the Golden Triangles, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar. Drugs were produced in Myanmar, Laos mostly,
*22:40.660- 22:46.600* :  and then flowed into Thailand and then beyond into the rest of the region. Now, because Vietnam is
*22:46.600- 22:52.040* :  really on the up and up, they're building better transport links. Well, that's also led to Vietnam
*22:52.040- 22:57.020* :  becoming a bit of a drug trafficking hub in its own right. It's now really challenging the Golden
*22:57.020- 23:02.680* :  Triangles, so things are really changing, but yeah, drug use and production is really on the rise in
*23:02.680- 23:09.660* :  the region. Sirea Hatton speaking to Alex Ritson. Sunday marked Remembrance Day here in Britain,
*23:10.120- 23:16.140* :  and in a ceremony at a war memorial in central London, King Charles honored armed forces members
*23:16.140- 23:22.920* :  from the UK and across the Commonwealth who died in the line of duty. In the United States, veterans
*23:22.920- 23:28.760* :  can find it difficult to reach Washington's war memorials because of their age or the cost of
*23:28.760- 23:34.820* :  traveling, but every year, thousands of them are flown to the capital on so-called honor flights
*23:34.820- 23:43.580* :  to thank them for their service. As Sophie Williams reports. It's a sunny day, and I'm standing close
*23:43.580- 23:48.880* :  to the World War II memorial, where volunteers are cheering the arrival of a group of veterans.
*23:52.320- 23:57.740* :  They're part of an honor flight, one of six groups visiting today, flown in from places such as
*23:57.740- 24:05.800* :  Ohio, Florida and Georgia. Among them is 95-year-old George Holmes. He served in the US Army in Europe
*24:06.280- 24:12.100* :  right after the end of the Second World War. We've been enjoying ourselves getting to
*24:12.140- 24:21.820* :  see some of the monuments, the main one I want to see is the World War II. Nearly 275,000 veterans
*24:21.820- 24:28.040* :  have been flown to Washington since honor flights formed 17 years ago. It raises money through
*24:28.040- 24:33.240* :  sponsors and other fundraising activities so that veterans don't have to pay for their trip.
*24:33.980- 24:39.860* :  Dr. Jordan Matinsky is on an honor flight from Milwaukee. He served in career in the medical
*24:39.860- 24:46.860* :  battalion. We went over to the Korean area, and there was a class or visitors from Korea there,
*24:46.860- 24:54.980* :  students, and they came and swarmed around me and hugged me and wanted pictures with me. I mean,
*24:54.980- 25:01.260* :  it's something I never would have expected. They were so happy that they kept saying what you guys
*25:01.260- 25:07.380* :  did for us. I mean, I was there during peacetime, really, but it was a great experience. This whole
*25:07.380- 25:12.860* :  thing is great. He's made friends with James Powell, a Vietnam veteran, also from Milwaukee.
*25:12.940- 25:20.240* :  He spent some time at the Vietnam Memorial. I did do something today that really made me feel good.
*25:20.740- 25:25.980* :  I had a friend that I lost in the Vietnam War. I mean, it's been over 50 years since all of this
*25:25.980- 25:33.360* :  has happened, but I had one of the attendees to help me find his name on the wall, and I did,
*25:33.360- 25:38.480* :  and I mean, it was so emotional. I thought I was going to break down, but I was greatly
*25:38.480- 25:44.280* :  appreciating the attendant that helped me. I just had to walk away. For Judy Minogue, who has been
*25:44.280- 25:49.840* :  at the World War II Memorial all day with her husband Jim, it's important to continue celebrating
*25:49.840- 25:56.420* :  the veterans. She started volunteering in 2015 after her father, a World War II veteran,
*25:56.420- 26:02.360* :  went on his own honor flights from St. Louis, Missouri. It was so amazing, and he was so
*26:02.360- 26:09.660* :  overwhelmed with emotion the whole day, that we realized this was a super important thing to
*26:09.660- 26:15.320* :  let these veterans know how much they're appreciated. So we continued to come down, and that was in
*26:15.320- 26:21.380* :  2015, and we got kind of addicted. As part of the experience, veterans are given letters on their
*26:21.380- 26:26.760* :  journey home from relatives and members of the public, and when they reach their home airport,
*26:27.280- 26:30.620* :  they're welcomed back with a big celebration in the arrivals hall.
*26:31.760- 26:37.440* :  For the Vietnam veterans, it's an extra emotional experience, as many did not receive the usual
*26:37.440- 26:43.960* :  cheers upon their return. Here's James Powell. Seeing the children and all of the people
*26:44.560- 26:49.080* :  thanking you for your service, it's very much, it's overwhelming.
*26:52.600- 26:58.280* :  That report from Sophie Williams. For hundreds of years, a mystery has drawn thousands of
*26:58.280- 27:04.120* :  amateur sleuths, tourists and scientists to a famously deep pool of water in Scotland.
*27:04.140- 27:10.620* :  Is there a monster that lives in Loch Ness? Well, the hunt intensified 90 years ago when the
*27:10.620- 27:16.740* :  first photo was taken, allegedly showing a beast emerging from the water. Madeline Drury has more.
*27:20.520- 27:26.020* :  Here is the most unusual film of recent years, but it proves the existence of a monster in Loch Ness.
*27:26.340- 27:33.020* :  The 1930s saw a fever spread in the search to find the Loch Ness monster, or Nessie. No longer
*27:33.020- 27:38.500* :  simply a local legend that dated back to sightings from the Middle Ages, a photo, seen as
*27:38.500- 27:44.400* :  undeniable proof for many at the time, captured the imagination of the world. It was a cold November
*27:44.400- 27:51.160* :  day in 1933 when Hugh Gray set out on his usual walk after church. He told the Scottish daily record
*27:51.160- 27:57.280* :  that he had noticed an object of considerable dimensions. Emerging about a meter out of the water,
*27:57.280- 28:03.380* :  not far from him, the photo he claims to have taken shows a dark outline. It resembles a snake
*28:03.380- 28:09.400* :  or an eel, but the grain equality and black and white image generally looks a bit like a smudge
*28:09.760- 28:14.580* :  on the caramel ends. Police were worried by public interest at the time, which saw people
*28:14.580- 28:20.120* :  bringing weapons to the Loch to kill the monster. Theories have been circulating ever since.
*28:20.380- 28:26.840* :  Got any legs. Of course not. It has. There have been several rather expensive investigations
*28:26.840- 28:33.300* :  to find evidence. In 1987, scientist Adrian Shine cobbled together over a million dollars
*28:33.300- 28:38.600* :  worth of equipment and sponsorship for Operation Deep Scan, widely seen as the most comprehensive
*28:38.600- 28:45.680* :  search. It was in essence extremely simple, a sonar curtain moving from one end of the
*28:45.680- 28:52.000* :  Loch to the other. But there has never been any conclusive evidence she exists. Perhaps the most
*28:52.000- 28:56.580* :  famous photograph claiming to be the Loch Ness monster was published a year after Hugh Gray's
*28:56.580- 29:02.200* :  photo was taken. It shows Nessie's trademark long neck popping out of the water and was revealed
*29:02.200- 29:08.360* :  to be a hoax in the 1990s when a man admitted to being involved in staging the photo. Some
*29:08.360- 29:13.900* :  estimates suggest the mystery still brings 50 million dollars to the Scottish economy each year,
*29:14.480- 29:20.220* :  so with over a thousand official sightings and counting. For many believers, the search continues.
*29:22.440- 29:28.100* :  And finally, the London-born musician Albert Hammond has co-written songs for some of the biggest
*29:28.100- 29:34.400* :  names in pop music from Whitney Houston to Tina Turner and Rod Stewart. Since he started back
*29:34.400- 29:40.660* :  in the 1960s, he's also had hit songs in his own right, one in Emmy, and been Oscar-nominated.
*29:41.000- 29:46.920* :  At the age of 79, Albert Hammond's senior is bringing out a new album called Body of Work,
*29:47.460- 29:49.760* :  and he told Martin Venard how it came about.
*30:00.320- 30:08.800* :  I went through a breakup after 40 years, and then I got vocal atrophy, and then I got COVID.
*30:08.800- 30:18.000* :  All this stuff was like a heavy weight on me, and I went within. And then all this music suddenly
*30:18.000- 30:24.000* :  started to come to me. That's what became Body of Work. Most of the songs and most of the album,
*30:24.200- 30:31.020* :  they're all really about freedom and peace. Don't bother me, Bay, there's, I'm not hearing
*30:31.020- 30:35.640* :  all, so don't tell me about all. He seems it doesn't matter. Don't bother me, Bay.
*30:38.740- 30:44.300* :  If I'm going to take you back to some of your older work, you've performed your own material,
*30:44.300- 30:49.700* :  such as it never rains in Southern California, which is very prescient really, that song.
*31:04.040- 31:07.500* :  What are your sort of memories of performing your own material?
*31:07.900- 31:13.920* :  I started writing songs, and there was always somebody else singing, and when I went to Los Angeles,
*31:13.980- 31:20.680* :  and I did an audition for Clive Davis, and I played him at Never Rains, and I gave it to the
*31:20.680- 31:26.500* :  seekers I gave it to Glenn Campbell. They told me, oh, it's a terrible song. I played him that one,
*31:26.500- 31:30.540* :  and he said, that's going to be your single, and that's going to be the title of the album.
*31:30.840- 31:36.400* :  And you've written for many other artists, Whitney Houston, Starship, Rod Stewart.
*31:44.700- 31:50.240* :  Staying in song forever, nothing gonna stop us now.
*31:51.340- 31:59.920* :  When I need him, how does it feel when you see other people having hits with your songs?
*32:00.580- 32:07.740* :  It's just wonderful. I remember being in L.A. producing Julio Iglesias, and Rod Stewart was in
*32:07.740- 32:13.260* :  the same studio, and then I'd see him in the Italian restaurant opposite, and he said,
*32:13.660- 32:18.160* :  Albert, write me a when I need you, and I go, I already wrote when I need you, you know,
*32:18.160- 32:23.500* :  I can't write you a when I need you. But why don't you do it when I need you? Now it's already
*32:23.500- 32:28.920* :  been a hit, you know, and then he did when I need you, you know, which was unbelievable.
*32:29.080- 32:34.460* :  Your son Albert Hammond Jr., he's had a lot of success with the strokes and a solo artist.
*32:34.600- 32:39.960* :  How does it feel seeing your son taking up the job as a musician and succeeding?
*32:40.060- 32:45.540* :  It's a father's dream, isn't it? I was quite involved at the beginning with the strokes before
*32:45.700- 32:51.760* :  anybody knew them because nobody wanted them. I just put up the money for their first EP.
*32:52.440- 32:56.940* :  I'm just so proud of him. I'm proud of all the strokes because they're still together.
*32:57.480- 33:01.800* :  If you don't mind me saying you're AT next year, what are your plans?
*33:01.820- 33:10.020* :  To go back to being 30, you know, I would love to start touring again. I'm writing more than I
*33:10.020- 33:14.560* :  ever was because I'm so inspired going on. You're so much going on in the world.
*33:28.060- 33:31.920* :  Albert Hammond and his music speaking there to Martin Venard.
*33:33.540- 33:37.240* :  And that's it for Mazvanar, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
