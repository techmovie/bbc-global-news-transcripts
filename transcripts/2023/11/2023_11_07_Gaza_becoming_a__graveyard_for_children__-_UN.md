*01:04.900- 01:08.500* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:11.580- 01:16.080* :  I'm Gareth Barlow and in the early hours of Tuesday the 7th of November, these are our
*01:16.080- 01:16.780* :  main stories.
*01:17.320- 01:22.320* :  The UN Secretary-General has warned that Garza is becoming a graveyard for children as
*01:22.320- 01:25.680* :  he launched a major new humanitarian appeal for the territory.
*01:25.740- 01:31.140* :  Meanwhile, the Hamas-Rine Health Ministry says Israeli strikes on Garza on Monday have
*01:31.140- 01:32.540* :  left 60 people dead.
*01:33.240- 01:38.400* :  In other news, Donald Trump has clashed repeatedly with the judge at his civil fraud trial in New
*01:38.400- 01:42.160* :  York and has been warned not to treat the hearing like a political rabbi.
*01:45.260- 01:51.900* :  Also in this podcast, the story begins in 1708, the Spanish Galean San Jose, part of
*01:51.900- 01:57.120* :  a treasure fleet with 600 men on board, is cruising towards Cartagena in Colombia.
*01:57.720- 02:02.580* :  Now it seems a race is underway to raise what's been called the holy grail of shipwrecks.
*02:03.000- 02:06.480* :  Maybe 200 tons of treasure might have something to do with it.
*02:10.880- 02:16.360* :  But first, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has launched an appeal for $1.2 billion
*02:17.180- 02:20.800* :  to help Palestinian civilians in Garza and the occupied West Bank.
*02:21.240- 02:25.420* :  He warned that the wrath of crossing into Garza, the only one not controlled by Israel,
*02:25.860- 02:29.200* :  lacked the capacity to process aid trucks at the scale needed.
*02:29.760- 02:35.060* :  Mr. Guterres said the area had become a graveyard for children and warned that no party to any
*02:35.060- 02:36.680* :  conflict is above the law.
*02:37.240- 02:39.280* :  The way forward is clear.
*02:40.280- 02:42.580* :  A humanitarian ceasefire now.
*02:43.800- 02:49.160* :  All parties respecting all their obligations and the international humanitarian law now.
*02:50.320- 02:54.520* :  These means the unconditional release of the hostages in Garza, now.
*02:55.520- 03:00.880* :  The protection of civilians, hospitals, UN facilities, shelters and schools, now.
*03:02.060- 03:08.080* :  More food, more water, more medicine, and of course, fuel entering Garza safely, swiftly
*03:08.140- 03:10.240* :  and at a scale needed, now.
*03:11.460- 03:15.840* :  And feathered access to delivered supplies to all people in need in Garza, now.
*03:16.900- 03:20.540* :  In the end of the use of civilians as human shields, now.
*03:21.460- 03:26.000* :  That was the voice of Antonio Guterres, while the BBC's image and folks has more on what
*03:26.000- 03:28.100* :  the UN Secretary-General had to say.
*03:28.540- 03:34.340* :  Antonio Guterres said the world must act now to end what he called in human collective
*03:35.040- 03:35.060* :  suffering.
*03:35.620- 03:38.260* :  The responsibility fell on all of us, he said.
*03:38.780- 03:45.200* :  On Hamas, to release the hostages and end its rocket attacks on Israel to allow unfettered
*03:45.200- 03:52.320* :  access for aid supplies to Garza, on both sides to agree a humanitarian ceasefire and
*03:52.320- 03:55.840* :  on the international community to help pave the way to peace.
*03:56.540- 04:01.660* :  These UN appeals have been made before, so far there has been little response.
*04:02.300- 04:06.400* :  Imagine folks there, while Mr Guterres's comments follow a pledge by the European Union
*04:06.400- 04:11.700* :  to increase its humanitarian aid for civilians in Garza, by around 27 million dollars bringing
*04:11.700- 04:14.120* :  it to a total of more than 100 million.
*04:14.840- 04:19.080* :  Well, it's exactly a month since Hamas government stormed across the border from Garza into
*04:19.080- 04:24.380* :  Israel and massacred 1400 people and seized more than 200 others as hostages.
*04:25.000- 04:29.860* :  Israel retaliated with air strikes on the Garza Strip, followed by a ground offensive that's
*04:29.860- 04:32.000* :  now claimed more than 10,000 lives.
*04:32.540- 04:37.540* :  That's according to Hamas, which has designated a terror organisation by many Western governments.
*04:38.120- 04:43.100* :  The past 24 hours have seen some of the most intense Israeli air strikes so far.
*04:43.740- 04:48.000* :  On 7th, the Garza Strip between the North and the South, the Israeli forces are pushing
*04:48.000- 04:52.660* :  in towards some of the most built-up areas in the North, where at least 300,000 civilians
*04:52.660- 04:57.040* :  remain, unwilling or unable to move to the relative safety of the South.
*04:57.480- 05:01.820* :  It's also estimated that in total, around a million people have been displaced.
*05:02.440- 05:06.600* :  Juliet Tumour from the UN Agency, Unwa, said a ceasefire was long overdue.
*05:07.160- 05:09.220* :  It's been one month of hell.
*05:09.940- 05:12.480* :  Nearly 10,000 people are reported killed.
*05:12.480- 05:14.180* :  More than 4,000 children.
*05:14.180- 05:16.920* :  We lost 88 under colleagues.
*05:17.980- 05:22.600* :  The situation goes from bad to worse by the minute.
*05:22.600- 05:24.820* :  Our shelters are overflowing.
*05:24.820- 05:26.640* :  They're overflowing with people.
*05:26.640- 05:31.380* :  We are currently hosting 700,000 people in our shelters.
*05:31.380- 05:36.000* :  Some people are being forced to sleep on the floor.
*05:36.920- 05:41.140* :  Among those, under Israeli fire is our Garza correspondent, Rishdi Abu Alouf.
*05:41.380- 05:44.880* :  He had to move with his family from the North to the South of the Territory.
*05:45.280- 05:46.680* :  It's on my colleague, Sarah Montague.
*05:46.680- 05:48.360* :  What life was like that on Monday?
*05:48.840- 05:50.960* :  In the market, I've been to the market yesterday.
*05:51.000- 05:53.920* :  Very few items are still there.
*05:53.920- 05:58.560* :  Can, food, tuna and some of very, very small items.
*06:01.060- 06:03.560* :  Rishdi, we heard that.
*06:04.920- 06:06.960* :  Yeah, it seems an air strike.
*06:08.980- 06:12.700* :  Do you need to go, do you need to go, do you need to take cover, Rishdi?
*06:12.700- 06:13.560* :  Okay, okay.
*06:14.120- 06:16.560* :  I'm not sure, it's air strike close to the hospital here.
*06:17.660- 06:17.880* :  Really?
*06:18.380- 06:20.860* :  We can hear the sound of a plane overhead.
*06:22.040- 06:23.960* :  Yeah, yeah, there was an explosion.
*06:25.400- 06:34.120* :  Oh, I could see now a smoke raised out of approximately a hundred meters from the hospital.
*06:35.620- 06:39.000* :  We don't know yet what's the target, but yeah, it's definitely an air strike.
*06:39.600- 06:41.320* :  When that happens, Rishdi, what happens?
*06:41.320- 06:42.380* :  Does everybody stop?
*06:44.300- 06:45.720* :  Well, people get used to it.
*06:45.740- 06:48.780* :  You know, thousands of air strikes were everywhere.
*06:48.780- 06:55.180* :  And especially in Hanyunas, before the start of the ground operation,
*06:55.180- 06:59.120* :  it used to be daily, every day hundreds of air strikes around Hanyunas.
*06:59.500- 07:04.960* :  I just can't see a huge smoke coming out of somewhere close to
*07:05.180- 07:06.780* :  Nasar Hospital here in Hanyunas.
*07:06.780- 07:11.480* :  It's most likely at the direction of the local market here.
*07:11.480- 07:16.640* :  And where there is also about four or five U.N. schools, thousands of people
*07:17.220- 07:19.860* :  are taking the U.N. schools as shelters.
*07:19.860- 07:23.960* :  So we don't know yet what was hit, but yes.
*07:24.540- 07:29.080* :  I mean, talking to you now and hearing what's going on, it's terrifying.
*07:29.880- 07:30.920* :  But you sound very calm.
*07:33.880- 07:39.400* :  Well, after a month of hearing, the explosions, the human reaction will be changed, you know.
*07:40.280- 07:44.820* :  And once it's not you, then you feel safe, you know.
*07:45.540- 07:47.640* :  The voice there of Rushdie Abu Aluf.
*07:48.120- 07:50.660* :  Well, as we heard, Israel has been stepping up.
*07:50.660- 07:54.120* :  It's offensive in Gaza, confirming that it's cut the territory into.
*07:54.800- 07:57.920* :  So what is the strategy now for the Israeli defense forces?
*07:57.920- 08:03.160* :  Matthew Amrolywala spoke to Lieutenant Colonel Peter Loner, a spokesperson for the IDF.
*08:03.540- 08:07.000* :  The IDF is moving forward with its plan, staged by stage,
*08:07.000- 08:12.240* :  strike by strike to dismantle and destroy Hamas as the governing authority and a terrorist
*08:12.260- 08:14.300* :  entity on the border with Israel.
*08:14.300- 08:20.700* :  This is part of the plan, and indeed overnight we achieved the last stage of our encirclement
*08:20.700- 08:26.720* :  of Gaza City and taking the war to Hamas so that they are pursued and can't live in comfort
*08:27.280- 08:32.400* :  as they continue their attacks and and attempted to continue their strikes against us.
*08:32.400- 08:39.520* :  Of course, part of this operation is indeed from the strategic perspective of removing Hamas
*08:39.700- 08:46.820* :  governing Gaza, but also keeping in mind the 240 or also hostages that Hamas is still holding.
*08:46.820- 08:52.740* :  Well, let me ask you a question. Do you think those strikes, 450 through the course of the last
*08:52.740- 08:57.400* :  24 hours makes it more or less likely those hostages will be released?
*08:57.840- 09:04.180* :  There is lots of efforts taking place in order to bring the hostages home both operationally
*09:04.180- 09:11.340* :  and diplomatically, of course. From our perspective, it is part and parcel of the effort
*09:11.340- 09:15.820* :  and the war effort that is ongoing. Absolutely. We have brought home and rescued
*09:15.820- 09:22.980* :  Ori McGiddish from captivity, and we will utilize all of the tools at our disposal in order
*09:22.980- 09:25.800* :  to bring home the hostages. Indeed, it is a huge deal.
*09:25.800- 09:32.040* :  That's a rescue of one out of 240. Let's talk about the civilians because upwards of 300,000
*09:32.040- 09:38.220* :  civilians still in the north of Gaza. You've said before Hamas was using them as human shields.
*09:38.220- 09:44.920* :  You've said before that Hamas is preventing them from leaving yet the bombing by Israel continues.
*09:45.360- 09:50.640* :  Are those people effectively collateral damage? I heard one soldier on the border talk about
*09:50.660- 09:57.320* :  civilians as collateral damage in war. Are those upwards of 400,000 people potentially collateral
*09:57.700- 10:02.960* :  damage now? Matthew, what we are seeing today on the border with Israel in northern Gaza
*10:03.440- 10:09.020* :  is a true tragedy, a human tragedy of people that have suffered for at the hands of Hamas
*10:09.480- 10:14.660* :  and are now suffering the repercussions of Hamas' feeble deterioration.
*10:14.660- 10:19.640* :  But it's your strikes that are killing them at the moment. Matthew, they are paying the price for
*10:19.640- 10:25.740* :  their government that failed them miserably. I'm sure it is your strikes that are killing them
*10:25.800- 10:30.480* :  at the moment. That is fact, isn't it? Matthew, I'm seeing the images coming out and any decent
*10:30.480- 10:36.260* :  person cannot be heartbroken by what's going on. But nevertheless, Hamas have to go. This is the
*10:36.260- 10:42.820* :  root cause of everything bad happening in the Gaza Strip today. They decided to go to war with Israel.
*10:43.300- 10:49.560* :  There is no other clear prescription other than removing Hamas. And indeed, we need the
*10:49.560- 10:54.020* :  international community. We need the international humanitarian organizations to rally around
*10:54.020- 10:59.180* :  the paradigm change. Well, they have rallyed around. They've said today enough is enough. We've had
*10:59.580- 11:05.440* :  reports that casualties are being taken to hospital by donkey because people can't actually
*11:05.440- 11:10.820* :  phone for ambulances because you cut communications. Cutting communications also means that the
*11:10.820- 11:15.620* :  outside world can't see what you're doing, doesn't it? There is no lack of reportage from Gaza.
*11:15.920- 11:20.740* :  You've been reporting it extensively on the BBC. I would say that the reality on the ground is
*11:20.740- 11:25.700* :  one detected by our need to get rid of Hamas. That is what needs to be done. It needs to be done
*11:25.700- 11:30.600* :  quickly. Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces.
*11:31.400- 11:36.060* :  While President Biden has spoken on the phone to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*11:36.060- 11:41.660* :  about the war in Gaza, a U.S. security spokesman John Kirby said the two main discussed efforts to get
*11:41.660- 11:46.740* :  more humanitarian aid into the territory and how to protect Palestinian civilians and enable them
*11:46.740- 11:51.900* :  to reach safer locations. Other talking points were securing the release of hostages and
*11:51.900- 11:57.720* :  curbing growing violence in the occupied West Bank. Hamas health officials say 60 people were killed
*11:57.720- 12:03.420* :  in southern Gaza on Monday, following the intense Israeli strikes in Kangunis and the Rafa area.
*12:03.960- 12:08.740* :  A British Palestinian surgeon who works at Gaza's largest hospital of Shifa has sent Abu
*12:08.740- 12:14.900* :  Sitter told the BBC what his evening had been like. As the evening progressed, we went to the emergency
*12:14.900- 12:22.020* :  department to help out and it was just scenes of carnage. We have no morphine and so these
*12:22.020- 12:27.860* :  multiple injuries and patients who have had surgeries are getting parasitimal and an
*12:27.860- 12:34.840* :  unsteroidal and just the agony that they're in is heartbreaking. I spoke to our correspondent Paul
*12:34.840- 12:40.220* :  Adams who's in Jerusalem and began by asking him about that figure of 10,000 dead that Hamas has
*12:40.420- 12:46.700* :  published. While we cannot be certain of exactly how many people have been killed, the figures
*12:46.700- 12:53.020* :  put out by the health ministry in Gaza which is run by Hamas have in the past proved to be generally
*12:53.020- 12:59.340* :  reliable and they also point out that they're not counting what could be many hundreds,
*12:59.340- 13:04.880* :  possibly thousands of people who have been trapped in the rubble so it could even be that 10,000
*13:04.880- 13:09.540* :  is a conservative estimate. And to give our listeners some level of context, the UN says around
*13:09.540- 13:16.780* :  9,700 civilians killed in Ukraine since the full scale of Russia invasion began 21 months ago.
*13:16.820- 13:23.440* :  Paul and meanwhile amongst all that death is this huge demand for aid and the UN chief today
*13:23.440- 13:28.120* :  criticizing what he said was the trickle of aid failing to supply the ocean of need.
*13:28.520- 13:35.220* :  Another point on those figures, this is the worst experience the Palestinian people have ever had
*13:35.220- 13:39.580* :  in their long bitter history with Israel. I think some of our listeners may think this is
*13:39.940- 13:45.980* :  kind of routine business in Gaza. It absolutely is not. This is just an absolutely staggering
*13:45.980- 13:51.780* :  unprecedented death toll in Gaza and I think people need to understand that. But as for the aid,
*13:51.780- 13:58.540* :  that remains a profoundly challenging and difficult area. It's clear that not enough aid is
*13:58.540- 14:03.860* :  getting in. You know, a few dozen trucks a day is simply making no difference really to the
*14:04.220- 14:09.740* :  fate of those people. It's thought to be around a million who moved from the northern part of
*14:09.740- 14:14.220* :  the Gaza ship down to the south plus those who who live in the south anyway, all of whom are still
*14:14.880- 14:20.100* :  living in fear of being hit in Israeli airstrikes and are now also just, you know,
*14:20.440- 14:25.960* :  scrabbling to get as much food and water as they can as these supplies dwindle and as prices rise,
*14:26.680- 14:31.760* :  fuel runs out and all of this. But the need is getting greater all the time and it's just not
*14:31.760- 14:37.640* :  being met by what is coming in. The voice there of Paul Adams. Now to other news, a month ago,
*14:37.640- 14:43.260* :  the Iranian human rights activists, Najiz Mohamedi won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight against
*14:43.260- 14:48.380* :  the oppression of women in her country. Now a family says she's gone on hunger strike in a prison
*14:48.380- 14:53.640* :  in the capital Tehran. It's in protest that the authorities denial of urgent medical treatment.
*14:53.640- 14:57.380* :  They're refusing to send her to hospital for an existing health condition,
*14:57.840- 15:01.840* :  unless she puts on a headscarf, which is compulsory to wear for women in public.
*15:02.540- 15:06.900* :  Iran's seen months of anti-government demonstrations triggered by the death in custody of a young
*15:06.900- 15:12.840* :  woman, Masa Amani, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing a hijab. Sivash Arlam from the BBC's
*15:12.840- 15:18.280* :  Persian service told me more. This has been ongoing for a few weeks now. She has been having some
*15:18.280- 15:25.240* :  health issues regarding her heart condition as well as her lungs. She has asked for permission to
*15:25.240- 15:32.720* :  be transferred to a hospital in order to get herself treated, but as she is not wearing the mandatory
*15:32.720- 15:37.980* :  hijab, she's not observing this law, which is a requirement for entrance and admission to a hospital,
*15:37.980- 15:45.280* :  the authorities have refused to transfer her. She is not giving in because, as a sign of protest,
*15:46.120- 15:51.780* :  she refuses to wear her scarf. Hence, now it's ended up with her going on a hunger strike,
*15:51.780- 15:56.260* :  trying to pressure the authorities to allow for this transfer to happen.
*15:56.920- 16:02.980* :  And just remind us why she is in jail in the first place, and also why she was awarded the
*16:02.980- 16:08.660* :  Nobel Peace Prize. Well, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle for against
*16:08.660- 16:15.860* :  oppression, as was stated in the speech initially, when the announcement was made. She has been a fierce
*16:15.860- 16:22.860* :  advocate of civil disobedience. And now, after last year's protest, nationwide protest against
*16:22.860- 16:30.600* :  mandatory hijab, now a voice also for the abolition of mandatory hijab. She's prism for her has
*16:30.600- 16:37.860* :  been a revolving door since 20 years ago when she entered political activities, even going back
*16:37.860- 16:44.240* :  to her university days. One of her, the major reasons why she initially went to prison back 15,
*16:44.240- 16:51.260* :  20 years ago was because of her campaign to have the death penalty abolished. And then after
*16:51.260- 16:56.900* :  that, she kept on going in and out of prison. But last year, or what the judiciary did in order to
*16:56.900- 17:03.980* :  keep her in prison and not let her voice be heard, was to extend her sentence for another 10 years,
*17:03.980- 17:09.740* :  because of the things she said while she was in prison, exposing sexual harassment inside
*17:09.740- 17:15.040* :  Iranian prisons that had really angered the judicial authority. So they extended her sentence,
*17:15.100- 17:20.660* :  but that has not stopped her from issuing these various statements every now and then from
*17:20.660- 17:25.920* :  inside the prison, because her family are holding her Instagram account and she expresses her views
*17:26.500- 17:31.980* :  through that. So prison hasn't stopped that. But so it's now just become a question of, you know,
*17:31.980- 17:38.480* :  uh, stand just now a face off between her and the Islamic Republic. Now she's won Nobel Peace Prize.
*17:38.480- 17:44.840* :  More people know her. She's become a familiar name. And she is inspiring more people. So
*17:45.120- 17:51.280* :  her hunger strike is likely to bring up the issue of mandatory hijab once again in the country.
*17:51.840- 17:57.840* :  Sivash Arlan from BBC Persia. A man in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease is walking again
*17:57.840- 18:03.820* :  after being fitted with a pioneering implant in his spine. Parkinson's is a brain disorder that
*18:03.820- 18:08.940* :  causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking stiffness and difficulty with
*18:08.940- 18:15.100* :  balance and coordination. Margot Yetmu is 63 and from Bordeaux in France is the first person in
*18:15.100- 18:20.240* :  the world with Parkinson's to try out the device. And he says it's given him a second chance at life.
*18:23.080- 18:29.000* :  As soon as I tried to take it out, I'd fall over. When you walk with this disease as soon as
*18:29.000- 18:35.120* :  there's an unexpected obstacle, you stop and start skating. Then you basically fall. I mean,
*18:35.120- 18:41.360* :  it's a different story now. I'm back to her normal life. I've gone to Brazil. I could go walk,
*18:41.680- 18:48.180* :  walk five kilometers. But technology is similar to that, which has been
*18:48.180- 18:53.440* :  used to help some spinal injury patients, but it is a first for Parkinson's. The medical team
*18:53.440- 18:58.780* :  treating him have described the advance in nature, medicine journal. Evan Davis spoke to Gregor
*18:58.780- 19:03.960* :  Cortine and Justin Block from Losing University Hospital in Switzerland, who apart of the team,
*19:03.960- 19:09.680* :  he first asked Jocelyn about the procedure. To Mr. Goethe, I did a surgery. This surgery consists
*19:09.680- 19:17.160* :  in inserting electrodes on the spinal cord that is controlling leg movements and to link
*19:17.160- 19:23.020* :  these electrodes to a neurostimulator located in the region of the abdomen. Everything is
*19:23.020- 19:28.300* :  connected with cable that are under the skin and you communicate with the stimulator with a remote
*19:28.300- 19:35.060* :  control. Gregor, why has no one thought of this before for Parkinson's, given that it is a
*19:35.060- 19:41.380* :  treatment that has been used for other conditions? Well, to classically therapy for Parkinson's disease
*19:41.380- 19:47.220* :  target the brain, because this is the region depleted in dopamine. Nobody really thought about
*19:47.220- 19:52.800* :  targeting the region of the spinal cord directly involving controlling leg muscles, which is
*19:53.260- 19:57.940* :  more or less intact, but the brain does not communicate properly with the spinal cord because of
*19:57.940- 20:05.520* :  the disease. It's fascinating. Jocelyn, talk us through how successfully it worked on on Mark
*20:05.520- 20:12.000* :  Goethe, and how long it took for him to become more mobile and to walk more freely.
*20:12.900- 20:18.740* :  So you have to understand that Mark started his disease 30 years ago, and he was first
*20:18.740- 20:25.180* :  treated with dopamine, and then he had DBS electrodes. And with time, he started presenting
*20:25.180- 20:32.540* :  gate deficits. So he was unable to walk. He was falling every day. So with the stimulation,
*20:33.340- 20:39.820* :  he immediately regained the ability to step and to walk without falling. When you see this
*20:39.820- 20:46.660* :  result, it's great news. Okay, so Greg, what tell us now? What to expect? I mean,
*20:47.760- 20:52.960* :  this treatment is clearly possible. Is this now something to roll out? Clearly, we have to
*20:52.960- 20:58.660* :  calibrate the expectation. We only have one test pilot at the moment for this neuro prosthesis,
*20:58.900- 21:03.940* :  and the key next step for us is to test the same time of approach. We improve technology
*21:03.980- 21:09.880* :  that we develop with a mechanical onward. In six patients, we have the key support of the
*21:10.060- 21:15.940* :  Michael Jeff Fox Foundation that will allow us to be to understand where the responder of the
*21:15.940- 21:21.060* :  treatments and what are the specific requirements to ensure that patient can use this technology
*21:21.060- 21:26.780* :  throughout the day. And of course, medical development takes time. So it will take at least five
*21:26.780- 21:30.640* :  years before this will become a therapy, but this is really our objective to make this
*21:30.640- 21:37.860* :  variable for everyone we need it. I find Greg, I find it really hard to understand how the brain
*21:37.860- 21:44.800* :  can interact with electronic devices in the body. And well, at least without a lot of training
*21:44.800- 21:51.060* :  to somehow link the two. I mean, is it possible to explain how this works, what it's doing?
*21:51.660- 21:58.420* :  Actually, very natural because the stimulation is applied to the region that the brain is trying
*21:58.420- 22:04.380* :  to activate, but often does it poorly or weekly. Imagine that, for example, your quadricep muscle
*22:04.380- 22:10.780* :  is weakened because of the disease. And the stimulation will add a little bit of energy in
*22:10.780- 22:17.460* :  activation of the muscle. And for Mark, it becomes very natural because it's just an enhancement
*22:17.460- 22:23.660* :  of his ongoing muscle activity. Greg, we're a protein and Justin Block from LosingUniversity Hospital
*22:23.660- 22:32.500* :  in Switzerland. Still to come. The big new rocket is still away from launching.
*22:32.540- 22:39.420* :  It's made in flight. The medium left rocket is basically benched because it's had recent failures.
*22:39.900- 22:43.280* :  So how big is the crisis at the European Space Agency?
*22:50.860- 22:54.720* :  Ryan Reynolds here from Mintmobile. With the price of just about everything going up during
*22:54.720- 22:59.560* :  inflation, we thought we'd bring our prices down. So to help us, we brought in a reverse

*23:38.640- 23:44.480* :  Reynolds have seen everything from a family of abominable snowmen to a massive slug
*23:45.100- 23:51.360* :  of feeling like being on the edge of a cliff. Amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service.

*23:55.340- 23:59.520* :  But now welcome back to the Global News podcast and to the United States now.
*23:59.860- 24:04.760* :  And Donald Trump has drawn scorn from the judge presiding over his civil fraud trial
*24:05.200- 24:09.960* :  as he took to the stand in a New York court. The former president is accused of massively
*24:09.960- 24:15.140* :  inflating the value of his properties in order to secure favorable loans. He though denies this.
*24:15.560- 24:20.560* :  Losing the case could result in a multi-million dollar fine and a ban on Mr. Trump doing business
*24:20.560- 24:26.120* :  in the state in New York. He told the assembled media that it was a politically motivated prosecution.
*24:26.640- 24:31.500* :  That's a very unfair situation. This is really election interference. It's only just
*24:31.500- 24:37.640* :  trial as ridiculous. It's a political warfare, as you would call it, or let go of the law fair.
*24:38.200- 24:43.680* :  But we will go along and we will hopefully do very well in every regard. We'll win the election
*24:43.680- 24:47.860* :  and we'll make America great again. That's what we're going to do. We're going to make America great
*24:47.860- 24:52.940* :  again. But we have to take away from the thugs that we deal with and the horrible people that
*24:52.940- 24:57.680* :  actually must hate our country today is. I spoke to our correspondent in New York,
*24:57.680- 25:02.100* :  Neta Talfig, who explained more about the interaction between Donald Trump and the judge.
*25:02.440- 25:07.620* :  He has certainly been testing the judge's patience. At one point the judge told him this is not
*25:07.620- 25:12.280* :  a political rally and asked his lawyers to get him under control. At another point when he was
*25:12.280- 25:18.840* :  answering questions, he said irrelevant, irrelevant, just answer the question. So what we have here
*25:18.840- 25:24.800* :  is Donald Trump being who we normally see out at rallies and in public, not acting any different
*25:24.800- 25:31.060* :  on the witness stand here. He is answering questions in a combative way. He is making waving his
*25:31.060- 25:36.440* :  hands and making facial expressions and gestures that makes clear that he doesn't like some of the
*25:36.440- 25:42.260* :  questioning. But what he has basically said is a defense that has been repeated time and again
*25:42.260- 25:47.460* :  already on the stand by his sons. He says that he relied on his accountants to verify the
*25:47.460- 25:52.900* :  accuracy of his financial documents, which the judge has already found were fraudulent. He says that
*25:52.900- 25:59.080* :  while he did weigh in on how much things should value, he never directed anyone to lower or raise
*25:59.080- 26:05.880* :  the values on the statement. So he's very much trying to play both sides here, but also using this
*26:05.880- 26:12.120* :  as a political leverage to try to fundraise. And in fact, he pretty put on truth social, a quote by
*26:12.120- 26:17.020* :  the judge that was misquoted in a way because the judge at one point told Donald Trump's attorney,
*26:17.020- 26:23.420* :  I'm not here to hear what he has to say. I'm here to have him answer questions. And so Donald
*26:23.420- 26:27.600* :  Trump's attorney Alina Hubba came out and spoke to reporters afterward saying that this is all
*26:27.600- 26:32.100* :  a political witch hunt and slamming the judge for saying that he wasn't here to listen to Donald Trump.
*26:32.540- 26:38.700* :  That was Nettael Fink. The Polish president, Andre Duda, has given his ally the conservative
*26:38.700- 26:43.920* :  prime minister Mateusz Mordewiewski the chance to form a new government after elections failed
*26:43.920- 26:49.580* :  to produce a clear winner. Sarah Reinsford has the details. Three weeks ago, opposition parties in
*26:49.580- 26:54.820* :  Poland were celebrating victory. A record turnout at the elections had seen the governing law and
*26:54.820- 27:01.180* :  justice party lose its majority. The opposition declared themselves ready to take charge, but the
*27:01.180- 27:06.580* :  picture now is far less clear. Addressing the nation on television, President Duda has given
*27:06.580- 27:12.040* :  the current prime minister first crack at forming a new government, even though every party
*27:12.040- 27:18.360* :  in parliament has said publicly they won't work with him. So it looks like delaying inevitable change,
*27:18.360- 27:23.220* :  unless there are coalition talks behind the scenes that no one is yet admitting to.
*27:23.660- 27:28.940* :  Sarah Reinsford there. A nursery school in Germany is facing a backlash after suggesting it could drop
*27:28.940- 27:34.740* :  and frank from its name. During the Second World War, the Jewish teenager wrote a diary about hiding
*27:34.740- 27:40.600* :  from the Nazis, which became a world famous reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust. Critics say
*27:40.600- 27:45.080* :  the current suggestion of dropping her name from the school sends the wrong signal when reports
*27:45.080- 27:49.920* :  of anti-semitism are on the rise in Europe amid the conflict in the Middle East. Our burning
*27:49.920- 27:56.300* :  correspondent Jessica Parker has the details. Anne Frank died in a Nazi concentration camp aged 15.
*27:56.340- 28:02.360* :  The idea of rebranding a local kindergarten named after the Jewish diarist was part of a broader
*28:02.360- 28:08.160* :  overhaul of the centre, according to the mayor of Tangerhutte. But German media reports that the
*28:08.160- 28:13.220* :  nursery's director had suggested the name was hard to explain to little children and less
*28:13.220- 28:19.100* :  familiar to parents from migrant backgrounds. No final decision has been made and local counsellors
*28:19.100- 28:24.420* :  now getting ready to oppose the proposal. Now it was Jessica Parker. Next, to space.
*28:25.080- 28:30.940* :  Europe is at the heart of new space ambitions, ready to embrace ever greater technological
*28:30.940- 28:37.340* :  and human challenges. The first objective is to maintain autonomous launch capabilities for our
*28:37.340- 28:45.280* :  missions. Based on 50 years of experience in launchers, we can ensure space transportation for future
*28:45.280- 28:52.600* :  missions. In orbit around our home planet Earth, the International Space Station continues to
*28:52.600- 28:59.760* :  play an essential role as a research platform. That was a short excerpt from a video by the European
*28:59.760- 29:05.560* :  Space Agency or ESA on the concept of exploring other worlds. Its mission is to shape the development
*29:05.560- 29:11.640* :  of Europe's space capability, but it seems that that mission is faltering. Earlier this year,
*29:11.640- 29:15.880* :  the European Space Agency acknowledged that its next generation of rockets to send satellites
*29:15.880- 29:21.220* :  into space wouldn't be ready until at least 2024. That means that with the retirement of the
*29:21.220- 29:26.300* :  Iron Five, for the first time in decades, ESA has no rocket. In face of growing competition,
*29:26.300- 29:31.500* :  the agency has been holding a summit in Spain aimed at allowing it to continue to play a leading
*29:31.500- 29:36.420* :  role in space exploration. I heard more about what the European Space Agency is now planning
*29:36.420- 29:42.260* :  for our science correspondent Jonathan Amos. Big decisions in Seville today, as you say,
*29:42.260- 29:49.300* :  there is a crisis at the moment with European rockets. The big new rocket is still away from launching.
*29:49.360- 29:56.220* :  It's made in flight. The medium left rocket is basically benched because it's had recent failures.
*29:56.960- 30:02.420* :  And member states, 22 of them in the European Space Agency have decided this has got to change.
*30:02.420- 30:07.760* :  We can't go on like this. So what they're going to do is they're going to change their procurement
*30:07.760- 30:13.680* :  model. Now, I'll give you the example of NASA. NASA used to own and operate all of its space
*30:13.680- 30:17.800* :  vehicles. You'll remember the space shuttles. They owned and operated the space shuttles. When
*30:17.800- 30:24.680* :  they retired them, they changed the model. And today, they essentially contract out. So they buy a
*30:24.680- 30:30.560* :  service from the likes of Elon Musk and SpaceX. They purchase seats in those rockets and capsules.
*30:31.020- 30:36.440* :  And that's what they do. They don't own any of those vehicles SpaceX do. And ESA have decided
*30:36.440- 30:41.840* :  today they are going to follow that model. Now, there are some rockets coming to the launch pad. We
*30:41.840- 30:46.540* :  hope in the next year. And basically, they've got to put the hands in their pocket and sort that
*30:46.540- 30:50.980* :  out. But long term, this is the model that they're going to do. They're going to run competitions.
*30:51.540- 30:55.420* :  Private industry is going to have to come along and put some money on the table, put some skin
*30:55.420- 31:01.300* :  in the game. And ESA will see fund them to do that. And to kick it all off, the decision they've
*31:01.300- 31:06.880* :  made today is that they will run a competition for a space capsule, a robotic space capsule that will
*31:06.880- 31:13.020* :  go to the space station in the next five years. Private company will run it. They'll sell that service
*31:13.020- 31:19.220* :  to ESA. And then maybe it'll be turned into a crew vehicle that ESA will buy in the future. So
*31:19.460- 31:24.720* :  this is a paradigm shift. It's kind of boring policy. But it is massively important to the future
*31:24.720- 31:29.140* :  of Europe in space. And in an nutshell, then, considering that space exploration was driven
*31:29.140- 31:35.100* :  by governments, is this the heart failure of governments or success of billionaires? Well, clearly
*31:35.100- 31:41.460* :  the model that exists in Europe that did exist in America has failed. Because we don't have
*31:41.460- 31:47.080* :  independent access in Europe anymore into space. We are in a mess. We are in a crisis, okay?
*31:47.080- 31:53.700* :  So you look across the water and you think, NASA, it's working. What can we learn? Let's go that way.
*31:54.100- 31:58.820* :  Jonathan Amos there. Now for the gamers among us, one of the biggest games in the world has
*31:58.820- 32:04.220* :  got that bit bigger. The makers of Fortnite say more than 40 million players logged more than
*32:04.220- 32:10.280* :  100 million hours of playing time in the new season. Fortnite OG on Sunday alone. At one stage,
*32:10.280- 32:15.040* :  there were more than six million people playing at the same time. And they were even more trying
*32:15.040- 32:22.860* :  and failing to get logged in. Guy Lambert reports. A hundred gamers in one shrinking arena
*32:23.460- 32:28.600* :  in a fight to be the last player standing. A simple premise, but one that's proven a huge success
*32:28.600- 32:37.560* :  for publisher Epic Games since the creation of Fortnite in 2017. The developer says 44.7 million
*32:37.560- 32:42.560* :  players enjoyed a total of 102 million hours of combat in Fortnite OG on Sunday.
*32:42.560- 32:47.840* :  The new release brings back fan favourite locations and weapons, but has kept some of the updated

*33:03.840- 33:08.300* :  That report there by Guy Lambert. And finally to Colombia. And the race to
*33:08.300- 33:13.300* :  exume what's been dubbed as the holy grail of shipwrecks is getting underway. For Spanish
*33:13.300- 33:18.300* :  galleon San Jose sang more than 300 years ago and is believed to have been carrying 200
*33:18.300- 33:23.300* :  tons of treasure. The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, wants to prioritise raising the ship
*33:23.300- 33:29.060* :  before his term ends in 2026. But as a leader of table reports, his government isn't the only one
*33:29.060- 33:35.400* :  that believes it's strong gold. The story begins in 1708. During the war of the Spanish
*33:35.400- 33:41.480* :  succession, the Spanish galleon San Jose, part of a treasure fleet with 600 men on board,
*33:41.980- 33:47.380* :  is cruising towards Cartagena in Colombia. But this journey is its last. In a battle with
*33:47.380- 33:52.080* :  Britain's Royal Navy, its gunpowder exploded, killing nearly everyone on board.
*33:52.660- 33:57.540* :  Just where it landed on the bed of the Caribbean Sea, remains a mystery for over three centuries.
*33:57.540- 34:03.880* :  But after the wreck was discovered, technology revealed in 2015 that its cargo contained
*34:03.880- 34:11.540* :  200 tons of gold, silver and emerald, with a staggering 20 billion dollars. Last year,

*34:17.060- 34:23.600* :  in museums and exhibitions. Equipment acquired in recent years has made it possible to obtain

*34:28.960- 34:34.920* :  and constant monitoring, so that the shipwrecks can be preserved and protected until their
*34:34.920- 34:41.800* :  riches can be made available to the world in museum exhibitions. His successor, Gustavo Petro,
*34:41.800- 34:48.040* :  seems to be operating with more urgency. He told his government to prioritise raising the wreck
*34:48.040- 34:53.260* :  before the end of his term in 2026. Perhaps he's been alerted to the rumblings of
*34:53.260- 34:59.500* :  disgruntlement from neighbouring countries. A US firm is demanding half of the cargo. It says it
*34:59.500- 35:04.580* :  originally found the ship in 1981. The Spanish government says it's rightfully theirs,
*35:04.580- 35:10.660* :  and a Bolivian indigenous group is requesting the safe return of items they say was stolen from them.
*35:10.660- 35:15.060* :  What's clear is a battle for the golden billions has resumed.
