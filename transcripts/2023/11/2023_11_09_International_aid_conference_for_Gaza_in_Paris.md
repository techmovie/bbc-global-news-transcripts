*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:20.340* :  by advertising. Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
*00:20.460- 00:25.440* :  Our billionaire this episode is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*00:25.720- 00:32.500* :  At its peak, WeWork was worth $47 billion. And Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*00:32.580- 00:37.620* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila and made people do shots during business meetings.
*00:37.840- 00:42.640* :  His modest aspirations, including wanting to live forever, to become the world's first trillionaire
*00:42.640- 00:48.360* :  and expand his company to Mars. What we learned in the last couple of weeks is in reality, he oversaw
*00:48.360- 00:53.600* :  one of the most spectacular business failures in modern history. So is he good, bad, or just another
*00:53.600- 00:57.820* :  billionaire? To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*01:03.260- 01:09.420* :  It's exhilarating. It's like driving a car under an avalanche, but you're taunting the avalanche
*01:09.420- 01:14.520* :  rather than trying to get away from it. Amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service.

*01:20.260- 01:23.880* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:26.600- 01:33.420* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday 9th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:33.860- 01:38.980* :  An international conference in Paris has heard repeated appeals for a humanitarian ceasefire
*01:39.240- 01:44.800* :  in Gaza more than a month after Israel launched its bombardment, but expectations are low.
*01:45.360- 01:50.740* :  Israel is again allowing Palestinians to leave northern Gaza as its forces move into the heart
*01:50.740- 01:56.160* :  of the main city. Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has reached a controversial
*01:56.160- 02:00.240* :  deal with Catalan separatists that's expected to keep him in power.
*02:03.240- 02:09.360* :  Also in this podcast, Myanmar's military faces a turning point in the ongoing civil war as
*02:09.360- 02:15.520* :  insurgent groups along the border with China control more and more territory, and scientific
*02:15.520- 02:21.000* :  delight at the discovery of a new toad species in the high forests of Mount Kenya.
*02:21.500- 02:25.420* :  This one is quite remarkable, it's being quite different from those that we know,
*02:26.100- 02:31.460* :  and quite smooth skinned, quite grey-sale and interestingly coloured.
*02:35.660- 02:40.360* :  Very little aid is getting into Gaza for the civilians who have fled their homes to escape
*02:40.360- 02:46.060* :  the war between Israel and Hamas. The international community has been making desperate efforts to
*02:46.060- 02:51.400* :  try to get more supplies into the Palestinian territory, and aid conference is being held in Paris,
*02:51.860- 02:57.060* :  where delegates have called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza so more aid can get in.
*02:57.680- 03:02.940* :  However, Israel isn't attending the conference, claiming there's no humanitarian crisis in Gaza,
*03:03.380- 03:08.620* :  and the United States has only sent a low-level delegation. Since Hamas massacred more than
*03:08.620- 03:16.040* :  1,400 people, and, say the Israelis abducted 240 hostages, the cost to Gaza has been catastrophic.
*03:16.060- 03:22.420* :  The Hamas' run health ministry said that more than 10,000 people have been killed 40% of
*03:22.420- 03:28.760* :  them children. Jan Egoland from the Norwegian Refugee Council said a truth was an absolute necessity.
*03:29.200- 03:35.020* :  The head of the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees, Philippe Lasarini, described the situation
*03:35.020- 03:41.340* :  in Gaza. I was in Gaza last week, for the first time since the war started. I visited a
*03:41.340- 03:47.680* :  non-war school, sheltering thousands of people. It was heartbreaking. Children used to learn
*03:47.740- 03:53.200* :  in this school. Today, they plead for a piece of bread and a sip of water.
*03:53.920- 03:59.460* :  President Emmanuel Macron said he wanted a swift humanitarian pause and pledged an extra
*03:59.460- 04:06.000* :  $106 million in aid. A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry, Colonel Moshe Tetro,
*04:06.300- 04:09.800* :  told reporters there was no humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*04:10.520- 04:16.380* :  We know that the civil situation in the Gaza Strip is not an easy one. We know that there are
*04:16.380- 04:23.360* :  a lot of challenges. We know that there are a lot of difficulties, but I can say that there is
*04:23.360- 04:29.800* :  no humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. We are in war. We didn't pick up this war.
*04:31.120- 04:37.920* :  Hamas choose to open this war. So what can this conference achieve? Our Paris correspondent Hugh
*04:37.920- 04:42.680* :  Scofield has been following the debate. There are delegations from many countries,
*04:44.300- 04:50.100* :  not many high-level delegations, I wouldn't say. There is the Foreign Minister of Egypt,
*04:50.100- 04:55.620* :  there is the Palestinian Prime Minister, there are the Prime Minister of a few European countries,
*04:55.620- 05:02.780* :  Greece, Cyprus. But what we've seen this morning does not really give the light to the accusation
*05:02.780- 05:07.680* :  that this is going to turn into a little more than a talking shop because, frankly, that's what it is.
*05:07.900- 05:13.080* :  What we've seen in the last two or three hours is a fairly indigestible series of speeches from
*05:13.080- 05:18.280* :  one delegate after another introduced by President Macron, all of them pretty much saying the same
*05:18.280- 05:23.120* :  thing, which is, of course, horror at what's happening, horror at what happened at an octave
*05:23.120- 05:30.420* :  of the seventh and at a plea for international aid to help the Palestinians. It becomes pretty
*05:30.420- 05:34.440* :  indigestible because everyone is essentially saying the same thing and makes you wonder what is the
*05:34.440- 05:37.800* :  point of it all because clearly there's nothing substantial that's been discussed here.
*05:38.140- 05:43.220* :  It is really a forum. It's a forum for the world or large parts of the world to stand up and
*05:43.220- 05:49.160* :  publicly say that they are worried about this and hope that something can be done quickly to ease
*05:49.160- 05:52.460* :  the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza, but I don't think anything is going to come out of this.
*05:52.820- 05:58.260* :  So, from what you say, it's going to do nothing to increase the chances of aid getting through
*05:58.260- 06:03.560* :  that alone as he's far. There's no possible way that it's going to have any material effect
*06:03.560- 06:09.340* :  on the ground. There's no Israeli presence here. The Americans are at a very low level. They could
*06:09.340- 06:15.220* :  conceivably put pressure on the Israelis. It's clear that there is a sort of build-up of pressure
*06:15.220- 06:22.160* :  around the world for some kind of humanitarian pause and arguably this event will help focus
*06:22.160- 06:27.100* :  that pressure on Israel and ultimately might lead to some kind of change in the situation,
*06:27.140- 06:31.800* :  but operationally right now, it's going to have absolutely no effect at all.
*06:32.120- 06:37.000* :  Nothing could happen till the Israelis agree to let things happen, and that's not going to be
*06:37.000- 06:44.200* :  until the Israelis see fit. Huesco filled in Paris. Israeli troops are continuing to fight
*06:44.200- 06:49.280* :  Hamas militants in Gaza City with residents saying they're moving closer to two hospitals
*06:49.280- 06:55.080* :  where thousands of displaced people are taking shelter. Israel says Hamas has lost control
*06:55.080- 07:00.140* :  of Northern Gaza. For the fifth day, the Israeli military has again opened a corridor for
*07:00.140- 07:05.300* :  Palestinian civilians in the north of the Gaza Strip to evacuate to the south of the territory.
*07:05.300- 07:11.200* :  The Israeli army's Arabic language spokesman said the main road, Salah Al-Din Street,
*07:11.200- 07:16.540* :  would be open for six hours from 10 in the morning, local time. The spokesman said that
*07:16.540- 07:22.960* :  nestimated 50,000 gardens fled on Wednesday. The latest on the fighting, I spoke to our correspondent
*07:22.960- 07:27.160* :  Mark Lohan, who's in southern Israel close to the border with Gaza.
*07:28.020- 07:33.080* :  Well, in terms of the fighting, it continues, of course, a pace with the troops trying to,
*07:33.080- 07:38.460* :  Israeli troops trying to push further into Gaza City. They say that they face, for example,
*07:38.460- 07:43.920* :  10 hours of fighting yesterday, in order to overtake a Hamas stronghold, so that gives you a sense
*07:43.920- 07:49.780* :  of the intensity of the battles on the ground. The Israeli defence forces also say that 50,000
*07:49.780- 07:57.080* :  civilians fled south yesterday, that is, on Wednesday, taking the main road from the north of
*07:57.080- 08:02.100* :  Gaza down south to evacuate and to escape the worst of the Israeli shelling. That was a significant
*08:02.100- 08:08.380* :  rise in numbers on the previous days, and so they actually had to extend the window of evacuation
*08:08.380- 08:14.060* :  on that road by another hour given the numbers. And Hamas no longer apparently in control of the
*08:14.060- 08:19.620* :  north of Gaza? Well, the Israeli defence force says that, yes, the Hamas has lost control of
*08:19.620- 08:25.340* :  the north of Gaza. That is very much following the Israeli strategy to take control of the north
*08:25.340- 08:32.880* :  in circle and cut off Gaza City and allow civilians to move south. Now, they say that Gaza City
*08:32.880- 08:38.460* :  is the centre of Hamas control and command. They say that they have encircled the Hamas leader in
*08:38.460- 08:43.480* :  Gaza. In a bunker, we don't exactly know where, we assume somewhere in the north, and they've
*08:43.480- 08:48.000* :  described as a dead man walking, but we've not had an update on whether they have managed to
*08:48.200- 08:52.880* :  pursue their offensive against him in particular. But yes, the Israelis would say their strategy
*08:52.880- 08:56.700* :  is going according to plan. And I mean, there's some speculation here, Alex, that, you know,
*08:56.700- 09:02.900* :  the Israelis are under some pressure to have speed up and make rapid gains in these next few days
*09:03.500- 09:09.620* :  before the calls for pauses and ceasefires grow so overwhelming that they might have to
*09:10.120- 09:13.820* :  do something in order to try to lessen that offensive. Mark Lohan.
*09:14.440- 09:19.960* :  Our correspondent, Rusty Abu Aluf, is in the city of Han Yunus in southern Gaza, and he says
*09:19.960- 09:26.080* :  many more people were leaving parts of the northern Gaza area and making the arduous journey south.
*09:26.700- 09:34.220* :  It's a very difficult journey for the people after 34 days of being without water, clean water,
*09:34.220- 09:41.520* :  or without enough food to walk this road. I might seem to took this journey twice into Gaza,
*09:41.520- 09:47.160* :  but I was before the ground liberation when Israelis start to move tanks into Gaza and destroy
*09:47.160- 09:52.380* :  that road. The road is the highway, and it was open for cars. I was able to drive my car by,
*09:52.380- 09:59.620* :  but today, by then, when the Israeli started the ground liberation, the both sides of the road
*09:59.620- 10:06.240* :  were completely damaged. And people were unable to use any method, even like a car with a donkey
*10:07.020- 10:13.640* :  allowed to use or a bicycle or anything. It's just a walking group, and it's a long group,
*10:13.640- 10:20.040* :  and for people who are sick, or for people who are elderly, or children, or not fit enough to walk,
*10:20.620- 10:24.660* :  they can't make this journey. According to local authority here, they're talking about
*10:24.660- 10:30.200* :  still very high number there. You are talking about 400,000 or half a million people are still in
*10:30.200- 10:35.580* :  Gaza City that was before the open roads of. Very difficult to verify how many people
*10:35.580- 10:41.240* :  crossed and how many people are remain, but we also calling people, they are still in Gaza City.
*10:41.240- 10:48.260* :  They live in a five, six large neighborhoods in Gaza City, but the people who are in the
*10:48.260- 10:52.880* :  west side of the city and the east side of the city where the heavy fighting is going on.
*10:52.880- 10:58.160* :  Most of them, they decided, I met this here in the hospital yesterday, people from my neighborhood,
*10:58.160- 11:03.160* :  which is east of Gaza City, and they were still there, and they yesterday, they took this journey,
*11:03.540- 11:08.140* :  and they came as fighting, continue around the western part of Gaza City,
*11:08.600- 11:13.560* :  and the Israelis are pushing out the ground, the operation is pushing out towards the city center.
*11:15.000- 11:20.540* :  Rusty Abu Aluf in Khan Yunus. Since the war broke out, tensions have been high
*11:20.540- 11:25.800* :  among communities in Israel. The country is often called the Jewish state, but just over 20%
*11:25.800- 11:32.880* :  of Israel's population are Palestinian citizens or Israeli Arabs. As painful stories continue to
*11:32.880- 11:38.260* :  emerge, one group of people from both communities is determined to keep the peace on their streets.
*11:38.820- 11:41.120* :  Our reporter Emily Wither went to meet them.
*11:45.300- 11:51.160* :  The group have stopped at a line of trees, and they've got a black bucket of glue,
*11:51.620- 11:55.740* :  they've got some paper posters, and they're just attaching some of them to the trees.
*11:57.360- 12:01.240* :  What does that want to say? We'll go through this together, both in Hebrew and Arabic.
*12:01.860- 12:07.740* :  No two racism, and the third message is only peace will bring security.
*12:09.100- 12:14.160* :  It's Saturday night in the Israeli city of Haifa about an hour's drive north of Tel Aviv.
*12:14.540- 12:20.200* :  I've joined a group of Jewish Israelis and Palestinian citizens of Israel as they hang messages
*12:20.200- 12:24.920* :  of solidarity. Oh yeah, it's very, very heightened. You know, the tension is very heightened.
*12:24.940- 12:30.680* :  Even on the streets I've been driving, and you know, if I have like Arabic radio on, I would like
*12:30.680- 12:37.660* :  put it down. Salih Abed works for a Jewish Arab peace group called Standing Together.
*12:37.660- 12:43.920* :  She's a Palestinian citizen of Israel, or referred to by the state as an Israeli Arab.
*12:44.380- 12:46.800* :  It's an exceptionally challenging time for her.
*12:47.160- 12:52.060* :  Expressing any solidarity with the Palestinian people right now and with Gaza is seen as like
*12:52.940- 12:57.340* :  a complete lack of support for the Israeli state than what they're doing right now.
*12:58.360- 13:03.340* :  My mom is telling me like, yeah, we need to be obedient right now. We're just the good Arabs
*13:03.340- 13:08.080* :  that are only hurting for Jews. We're not Palestinian, we're not allowed to sympathize with our
*13:08.080- 13:14.020* :  people right now. Since the Hamas attack on Israel and the following Israeli bombing of Gaza and
*13:14.020- 13:19.560* :  the ground invasion, the group Standing Together, which works to promote peace and improve into
*13:19.560- 13:25.600* :  community relations, has gone into emergency mode. They've formed unofficial civil guards in
*13:25.600- 13:31.660* :  towns and cities across Israel to keep the peace in their communities. The group is scarred by
*13:31.660- 13:38.280* :  the events in May 2021 when another war in Gaza rippled through mixed communities in Israel,
*13:38.840- 13:45.740* :  leading to rioting and arson. Right now, you can feel tensions are very high.
*13:46.440- 13:49.460* :  Why is it an issue that the police are here? Because we're spreading
*13:49.940- 13:54.700* :  Hebrew in Arabic. They're trying to prevent it as much as possible. So the police could stop you
*13:54.700- 13:58.260* :  from doing this tonight. Yeah, let's see. Have they done it in other cities?
*13:59.300- 14:02.360* :  Yeah, in Jerusalem. They have confiscated our t-shirts.
*14:03.220- 14:08.080* :  A mixed group walking the streets together would be unusual even in peaceful times,
*14:08.080- 14:14.720* :  but in the shadow of war such a public show of coexistence is what makes this grassroots movement
*14:14.720- 14:21.560* :  so remarkable. I asked two of them and Israeli and an Israeli Arab why they wanted to come tonight.
*14:22.040- 14:26.140* :  I think it's important to, you know, bring some hope in these times that
*14:26.900- 14:30.080* :  Jews and Arabs in Israel can still work together even in situations like this.
*14:30.800- 14:36.320* :  We don't have another place to live in. This is home and eventually we are going to stay here.
*14:36.440- 14:43.760* :  We don't have other place, so we have to learn how to be here together and we have to make it work.
*14:45.440- 14:46.400* :  Emily wither.
*14:47.760- 14:52.860* :  Other stories now. In recent months, the US has expressed alarm at the growing military
*14:52.860- 14:58.420* :  corporation between North Korea and Russia. And those concerns were raised by the visiting US
*14:58.420- 15:03.980* :  Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who's held talks with his South Korean counterpart Park Jin
*15:03.980- 15:09.920* :  in Seoul. For more on the reasons behind Mr. Blinken's trip, here's our correspondent in Seoul,
*15:09.920- 15:16.460* :  Jean McKenzie. He is here to reassure his ally South Korea that the US remains as he put it
*15:16.460- 15:22.020* :  focused and clearied on its role here in Asia. And when it comes to South Korea, that very much
*15:22.020- 15:27.800* :  hinges on the threat posed by North Korea and its nuclear weapons program. And the immediate threat
*15:27.800- 15:34.080* :  at the moment is this deepening relationship between North Korea and Russia, especially now the US
*15:34.080- 15:39.700* :  says that it has evidence that North Korea has started to ship large quantities of ammunition
*15:39.700- 15:45.700* :  and artillery to Russia for it to use in its war in Ukraine. He is very much saying that this is
*15:45.700- 15:50.980* :  a common threat for both South Korea and the US and the US is committed to try and counter this.
*15:51.320- 15:56.720* :  He interestingly said that this was a two-way street, though, that not only was North Korea providing
*15:56.720- 16:01.260* :  Russia with weapons, but the Russia was also providing North Korea with military technology.
*16:01.260- 16:06.960* :  We share profound concerns about the DPRK's growing and dangerous military cooperation with Russia.
*16:07.200- 16:10.960* :  The United States appreciates the clear message that President Yoon delivered the UN General
*16:10.960- 16:15.580* :  Assembly about the risks of that collaboration. Today, Mr. Park and I spoke about
*16:15.580- 16:21.360* :  further actions that our countries can take with partners to intensify pressure on Moscow,
*16:21.840- 16:26.420* :  not to transfer military technology to the DPRK, in violation of multiple UN Security Council
*16:26.420- 16:30.720* :  resolutions. This is something that people here in Seoul have been worrying about for a long time
*16:30.720- 16:35.940* :  about what Russia would give North Korea in return for these weapons, and this fear that Russia
*16:35.940- 16:40.760* :  would actually provide North Korea with some of the technical know-how to improve its weapons
*16:40.760- 16:47.000* :  and increase its threat. Mr. Blinken said today that they would continue to identify these cases,
*16:47.000- 16:51.900* :  that they would continue to expose Russia, and if necessary, they would find ways to counter
*16:51.900- 16:56.580* :  this transfer of weapons, that they were looking also at ways of putting pressure on Russia
*16:56.960- 16:59.900* :  to stop it providing North Korea with this military technology.
*17:00.800- 17:05.840* :  Jean McKenzie in Seoul. Spanish media are reporting that the governing
*17:05.840- 17:11.160* :  socialists have reached an agreement with a Catalan separatist party that would grant amnesties
*17:11.160- 17:16.420* :  to those involved in a failed independence bid. In return, the separatists would clear the way
*17:16.420- 17:21.940* :  for a government led by the Acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, our correspondent in Madrid
*17:21.940- 17:28.800* :  Guy Hegeco reports. Pedro Sanchez lost July's general election, but after his conservative rivals
*17:28.800- 17:34.120* :  failed to form a government, it's now the socialist leader's turn, and this agreement appears to
*17:34.120- 17:39.280* :  have secured him a parliamentary majority. He's expected to face an investor vote next week.
*17:39.920- 17:44.880* :  Among those who would benefit from the amnesty law is Carlos Pujdemon, the former Catalan
*17:44.880- 17:50.340* :  regional president who led a failed independence bid in 2017, and then fled to Belgium.
*17:50.800- 17:56.620* :  Mr. Sanchez has said the amnesty will help calm tensions in Catalonia. However, the right-wing
*17:56.620- 18:02.880* :  opposition says it's unconstitutional and threatens Spain's territorial unity. Guy Hegeco.
*18:03.660- 18:08.760* :  Now we bring you news of a thrilling discovery and the high forests of Mount Kenya,
*18:08.760- 18:15.520* :  a new species of toad known as the Kenyan volcano toad, or Kenya Freinoides Valkani.
*18:16.040- 18:21.800* :  This finding is shedding light on the mysterious evolutionary history of amphibians in East Africa,
*18:22.300- 18:26.760* :  and challenging previous nations about the biogeographical history of the region.
*18:27.280- 18:32.480* :  Dr. Simon Loeder, principal curator of vertebrates at the Natural History Museum in London,
*18:33.020- 18:36.100* :  has been telling Amel Rajan about the new toad species.
*18:36.920- 18:41.140* :  I think your listeners will know a lot about the toads that they see in the UK or in Europe,
*18:41.920- 18:46.380* :  quite large, quite glandular, and this one is quite remarkable as being quite different
*18:47.040- 18:54.780* :  from those that we know, and quite smooth skinned, quite graysal, and interestingly coloured.
*18:55.460- 18:56.400* :  Interestingly coloured, what does that mean?
*18:57.040- 19:03.120* :  So it's quite sort of green and brown, and it seems to be sort of nicely camouflaged in the
*19:03.120- 19:07.900* :  rainforest that it lives in. I read that you found a single specimen, is that right?
*19:08.540- 19:11.840* :  That's really a really intriguing aspect of this kind of thing.
*19:11.840- 19:14.240* :  Yes, how do you know that there's lots of them? What's your best guess as to the numbers?
*19:15.320- 19:20.500* :  Really difficult to answer that question, so we found one specimen.
*19:20.500- 19:26.680* :  It's not totally rare that you only find very few, particularly maybe with species that are very
*19:26.680- 19:34.940* :  cryptic, are difficult to detect, and I think maybe this species, given that it seems to be found
*19:34.940- 19:41.620* :  on trees, a tree climber, well camouflaged, so maybe it is quite difficult to actually see.
*19:42.500- 19:46.640* :  But it's also quite possible that its habitat is getting smaller,
*19:47.920- 19:54.460* :  and it's likely to be declining, so we're finding that as a common pattern with amphibians in general.
*19:55.140- 19:59.440* :  What do you, what else can you tell us about this particular species, about its disposition,
*19:59.540- 20:03.520* :  and about how you know it's a toad, because it toads themselves part of a much
*20:03.840- 20:05.580* :  broad of classification and what we call frogs?
*20:05.880- 20:11.420* :  Yeah, exactly, so toads, your listeners, maybe people think that they are
*20:11.420- 20:15.360* :  quite separate from frogs, in a sense they're in a separate group, but they're actually
*20:15.360- 20:22.720* :  part of the larger grouping of frogs, so they're within frogs. The toads are quite actually
*20:22.720- 20:28.940* :  variable from the ones that we typically place in the UK, very variable in size and colour,
*20:30.180- 20:37.300* :  and this canyon toad is just particularly exciting because we know very little about it,
*20:37.300- 20:42.820* :  but based on its close relatives, it probably is likely to do a number of interesting things,
*20:43.600- 20:49.500* :  and that includes maybe things like giving birth to live young, which these toads do in these
*20:49.500- 20:55.480* :  high mountains in East Africa. Dr Simon Loda from the Natural History Museum in London.
*20:58.660- 21:04.720* :  Still to come, Hollywood prepares to return to work as the longest actor strike ever ends.
*21:05.500- 21:10.860* :  This is something that was worth being on strike for, and our union has helped protect our future.
*21:17.080- 21:22.020* :  Suddenly my quilt is ripped off me, and my room is full of white men, and I thought I'm done for.
*21:22.220- 21:23.960* :  These are fascists, they found where I live.
*21:24.160- 21:29.240* :  Life's less ordinary is the podcast from the BBC World Service, bringing you extraordinary
*21:29.240- 21:34.820* :  personal stories from around the globe. Betrayal, it runs through my life and runs through my story.
*21:34.980- 21:40.300* :  I was just all alone in this vast broken system. I never gave up my dream.
*21:40.560- 21:44.320* :  Search for live's less ordinary, wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*21:49.760- 21:53.880* :  Ever wondered what the world's wealthiest people did to get so ridiculously rich?
*21:54.000- 21:58.960* :  Our billionaire this episode is the founder of co-working company WeWork Adam Newman.
*21:59.320- 22:06.040* :  At its peak, WeWork was worth $47 billion, and Adam had a lot of fun getting to that point.
*22:06.120- 22:11.160* :  He spent $20,000 on tequila and made people do shots during business meetings.
*22:11.380- 22:14.160* :  His modest aspirations, including wanting to live forever,
*22:14.160- 22:17.840* :  to become the world's first trillionaire and expand his company to Mars.
*22:18.460- 22:23.060* :  What we learned in the last couple of weeks is in reality, he oversaw one of the most spectacular
*22:23.060- 22:27.620* :  business failures in modern history, so is he good, bad, or just another billionaire.
*22:27.900- 22:31.340* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire, wherever you get your podcasts.
*22:38.020- 22:44.480* :  Myanmar has been run by a military government since it seized power after a coup in February 2021.
*22:44.480- 22:48.720* :  But now, it's facing a huge setback. In a matter of days,
*22:48.720- 22:53.220* :  it's lost control of much of its border with China following a coordinated attack
*22:53.220- 22:56.240* :  by three ethnic-insurgent groups in Shand State.
*22:56.740- 23:00.280* :  The military-installed president of Myanmar, General Mient Sway,
*23:00.660- 23:04.240* :  has warned that the country is in danger of breaking apart if the government
*23:04.240- 23:05.680* :  can't control the fighting.
*23:05.680- 23:10.320* :  Now, Southeast Asia correspondent Jonathan Head in Bangkok told me more.
*23:10.860- 23:13.440* :  Well, it's a very serious move for Myanmar's military government because
*23:13.440- 23:18.260* :  they've lost so much terrain. It was a coordinated attack by three very well-armed ethnic groups.
*23:18.260- 23:21.420* :  These are relatively small ethnic groups within Shand State
*23:21.920- 23:24.600* :  that have been fighting the central government for a long time,
*23:24.600- 23:29.660* :  intermittently with our clashes and trying to get their voice heard and expand the territory they hold.
*23:29.660- 23:34.800* :  Shand State itself is a very lawless region of Myanmar with lots of different armed groups.
*23:34.800- 23:38.500* :  It's famous as a source of illegal narcotics.
*23:38.500- 23:43.020* :  There's a lot of other illegal trans-border criminal activity that goes on there.
*23:43.360- 23:48.080* :  And it hasn't really played a big part in the national opposition movement,
*23:48.080- 23:51.160* :  now an armed opposition movement that's trying to overthrow the military.
*23:51.560- 23:54.880* :  It's largely focused on its own affairs, but these groups are very well-armed
*23:55.260- 23:57.980* :  and they've come together, launched this attack on the military.
*23:57.980- 24:01.800* :  This time saying they share the same goals as the mainstream opposition.
*24:01.860- 24:06.840* :  They want to overthrow the military government and they've inflicted quite a stunning defeat.
*24:06.840- 24:09.500* :  They've taken more than 120 military posts.
*24:09.820- 24:11.100* :  They've taken over a number of towns.
*24:11.100- 24:14.460* :  They basically control the border with China, which is critical to Myanmar.
*24:14.460- 24:16.160* :  A lot of its trade goes over that way.
*24:16.600- 24:20.980* :  They've managed to kill the senior command of the top military commander in that region.
*24:21.880- 24:24.600* :  And what's been interesting, it's been going for almost two weeks now,
*24:24.600- 24:27.640* :  is that the armed forces have been unable to respond.
*24:27.640- 24:29.520* :  They've been using air strikes in artillery.
*24:29.520- 24:32.020* :  We've seen them do that in the rest of the country as well.
*24:32.500- 24:33.900* :  But they're so overstretched.
*24:34.260- 24:35.940* :  And with many roads being cut as well,
*24:35.940- 24:38.020* :  they've just not been able to bring in any reinforcements.
*24:38.020- 24:40.080* :  They don't appear to have an answer to this.
*24:40.300- 24:43.320* :  It's also encouraged other armed groups in the rest of the country
*24:43.700- 24:45.120* :  to join in and launch their own attacks.
*24:45.120- 24:47.200* :  And the hope that this can build up more momentum
*24:47.560- 24:49.300* :  and put even more pressure on the military government.
*24:49.400- 24:51.020* :  What do you think China makes of this?
*24:51.280- 24:52.940* :  Well, that is the biggest question of all.
*24:53.100- 24:56.060* :  China takes a great interest in its border with Myanmar.
*24:56.060- 24:57.920* :  It's established economic zones there.
*24:57.920- 25:00.160* :  It sees it as strategically vital.
*25:00.680- 25:02.560* :  And these armed groups that have launched this attack,
*25:03.020- 25:04.960* :  one of the reasons they haven't got involved in the past is
*25:04.960- 25:07.720* :  because China does put pressure on them not to cause trouble.
*25:07.720- 25:08.820* :  They want stability there.
*25:09.280- 25:12.500* :  However, China's view has shifted in the last few months
*25:12.500- 25:17.200* :  because of all these scam centers that have proliferated in these lawless areas.
*25:17.580- 25:20.000* :  It's been asking the military government to shut them down.
*25:20.000- 25:21.100* :  That hasn't happened.
*25:21.100- 25:22.920* :  You've got thousands of Chinese citizens
*25:22.920- 25:25.000* :  who've been trapped in these scam centers.
*25:25.000- 25:25.760* :  Horribly abused.
*25:26.120- 25:28.120* :  It's getting a lot of publicity in China.
*25:28.120- 25:31.860* :  And it seems that China is perhaps turning a blind eye,
*25:31.860- 25:34.520* :  reckoning that letting these armed groups go in.
*25:34.960- 25:37.740* :  And as they're also promising, close down the scam centers.
*25:37.740- 25:41.180* :  It's one of the goals they have that that may be worth all the trouble
*25:41.180- 25:42.820* :  that it's going to cause a military government
*25:43.380- 25:46.080* :  about which I think China has a somewhat ambivalent attitude.
*25:46.460- 25:47.460* :  Sometimes it supports it,
*25:47.720- 25:50.640* :  but I think they also recognize they need to keep a foot in all camps
*25:51.020- 25:52.020* :  in Myanmar for the future.
*25:52.840- 25:54.460* :  Jonathan Haird in Bangkok.
*25:55.900- 25:57.340* :  Nearly four months after it began,
*25:57.420- 25:59.420* :  the actors strike in the United States,
*25:59.420- 26:01.000* :  which paralyzed Hollywood,
*26:01.540- 26:03.040* :  appears to have come to an end.
*26:03.180- 26:06.120* :  Union members had been asking for an increase in minimum salaries,
*26:06.120- 26:08.400* :  a share of streaming service revenue,
*26:08.860- 26:11.540* :  and protection from being replaced by AI.
*26:11.540- 26:15.580* :  Gareth Barlow spoke to our Los Angeles correspondent Peter Bose.
*26:16.320- 26:18.140* :  We're hearing that a tentative agreement
*26:18.140- 26:20.680* :  between the actors union and the studios
*26:21.260- 26:23.660* :  has been reached and that the strike is officially.
*26:24.180- 26:26.640* :  Over no details have been released yet.
*26:26.640- 26:27.420* :  We'll tell the deal,
*26:27.420- 26:30.440* :  a new three-year contract will go to the union's
*26:30.620- 26:33.920* :  national board on Friday for review and consideration.
*26:34.300- 26:36.040* :  That will be the final rubber stump.
*26:36.040- 26:38.320* :  It seems though to all intents and purposes,
*26:38.320- 26:41.280* :  this 118-day strike, as you say.
*26:41.280- 26:45.600* :  One of the longest labour stockpages in the history of the entertainment industry
*26:46.020- 26:47.020* :  that it is over.
*26:47.280- 26:49.420* :  And that presumably, Gareth means that the union
*26:49.940- 26:54.600* :  thinks it's got the best deal possible for its 160,000 members
*26:54.600- 26:56.460* :  on a number of key issues,
*26:56.460- 27:01.520* :  a general pay rise, a better deal for what are called residuals or repeat fees
*27:02.020- 27:04.500* :  for the work that actors do on streaming outlets
*27:04.980- 27:09.320* :  and an agreement on the use of artificial intelligence in filmmaking.
*27:09.340- 27:13.180* :  That was a huge concern that the likenesses of actors
*27:13.180- 27:15.220* :  could be digitised by the studios
*27:15.720- 27:18.160* :  and used in future without the performers
*27:18.740- 27:20.380* :  receiving any financial reward.
*27:20.820- 27:22.740* :  What would this mean in practice, Peter,
*27:22.740- 27:25.420* :  because it's when's the evening over on the west coast of the United States?
*27:25.420- 27:28.160* :  Does that mean that actors are going to be back on set Thursday morning
*27:28.160- 27:29.620* :  or will it take a bit longer than that?
*27:30.200- 27:32.060* :  It could mean that potentially you're right.
*27:32.060- 27:35.700* :  Officially, the strike is over at midnight local time.
*27:36.300- 27:39.240* :  That's when the restrictions on actors will be lifted.
*27:39.240- 27:41.500* :  So they could return to work immediately.
*27:41.500- 27:44.060* :  That said, a little time, I think, is needed for the productions
*27:44.060- 27:47.060* :  to pick up where they left off earlier this year.
*27:47.060- 27:51.860* :  So I'd expect a gradual return to work as soon as the studios can open.
*27:51.860- 27:54.580* :  And remember this strike meant just about everyone in Hollywood,
*27:54.580- 27:57.280* :  working in film and television was put out of work.
*27:57.280- 28:00.380* :  The camera operators, the sound technicians, the maker parties.
*28:00.560- 28:03.900* :  So there will be a big move to return to work that will have,
*28:04.200- 28:07.780* :  I think, quite a positive ripple effect right across town
*28:07.820- 28:11.040* :  and wider afield in the entertainment industry.
*28:11.340- 28:14.380* :  And briefly, Peter, it also took place during the writer's strike as well.
*28:15.060- 28:18.340* :  Yes. And the combined effect of the writer's strike
*28:18.340- 28:22.960* :  and the actors dispute a belief to have cost the California economy
*28:22.960- 28:25.540* :  over six billion dollars.
*28:25.540- 28:29.140* :  This has been very expensive for the industry
*28:29.140- 28:32.880* :  and a lot of people very relieved that it's finally over.
*28:34.420- 28:36.240* :  Peter Bose in Los Angeles.
*28:38.020- 28:40.760* :  The world's biggest survey on charitable work
*28:40.760- 28:44.780* :  suggests that people in poorer countries are often more generous
*28:45.080- 28:46.320* :  than those in the richest ones.
*28:46.320- 28:49.920* :  The survey covered 142 countries and millions of people.
*28:50.420- 28:51.620* :  Louisa Pilbeam reports.
*28:52.480- 28:55.940* :  For the sixth year in a row, Indonesia has been ranked top,
*28:56.300- 28:57.940* :  taking into account its populations,
*28:57.940- 29:01.000* :  financial donations and altruistic actions.
*29:01.700- 29:04.880* :  People were asked whether they had helped a stranger in the past year
*29:05.180- 29:06.540* :  or spent their time volunteering.
*29:07.400- 29:10.380* :  Many of the world's poorest and most challenged nations
*29:10.880- 29:13.920* :  came out as more generous than some of the richest countries.
*29:14.800- 29:16.840* :  Despite its ongoing conflict with Russia,
*29:16.840- 29:20.140* :  Ukraine is the second most generous country in the world.
*29:20.700- 29:23.200* :  Kenya, which is battling rising unemployment
*29:23.200- 29:27.000* :  and an increasing cost of living, came out third overall.
*29:27.720- 29:31.500* :  While the UK's population is the third most likely to donate money,
*29:31.500- 29:35.600* :  the country drops to 58th in the world for volunteering
*29:36.060- 29:38.840* :  and 112th for helping a stranger.
*29:39.580- 29:43.480* :  Liberia was fourth generous overall with the US fifth.
*29:44.160- 29:48.040* :  Myanmar, Q8, Canada, Nigeria and New Zealand
*29:48.420- 29:50.040* :  making up the rest of the top 10.
*29:51.200- 29:52.060* :  Louisa Pilbeam.
*29:53.020- 29:55.780* :  An Australian surfer has broken the world record
*29:55.780- 29:59.060* :  for the biggest wave ever paddled in two by a woman.
*29:59.460- 30:03.420* :  It happened when Laura Ennever was surfing in Hawaii in January,
*30:03.420- 30:06.200* :  but it's taken 10 months for her record to be verified.
*30:06.820- 30:08.260* :  This report is by Wendia.
*30:14.780- 30:19.260* :  Laura wasn't even thinking about busting a world record when she went to Hawaii,
*30:19.260- 30:25.000* :  but when she heard about a once in a decade giant swell on a Wahoo's north shore,
*30:25.000- 30:27.860* :  she grabbed her board and headed for the beach.
*30:28.240- 30:30.020* :  She could have waited for the second wave,
*30:30.020- 30:33.500* :  which was even bigger than the one that was thundering towards her.
*30:33.600- 30:36.280* :  But in the end, she was glad she made the right choice.
*30:36.800- 30:38.760* :  When I took off, I looked down the face and was like,
*30:39.260- 30:42.420* :  holy cow, this is the biggest wave you've ever been on
*30:42.420- 30:43.700* :  and just make it to the bottom.
*30:43.700- 30:45.180* :  I do not fall here at the top.
*30:45.480- 30:47.380* :  And yes, I made it to the bottom and then, yeah,
*30:47.720- 30:49.640* :  just got to let go and enjoy that ride.
*30:49.640- 30:51.960* :  And then the wave just like took me out of the bottom.
*30:52.460- 30:55.960* :  The adrenaline and the feeling of just like riding that wave was just amazing.
*30:56.720- 30:58.460* :  But the best was yet to come.
*30:58.920- 31:01.020* :  I got, you know, the biggest wave in my life was so cool,
*31:01.020- 31:02.720* :  but I just didn't think anyone shot it.
*31:02.840- 31:05.420* :  It was until like a few days later, I got an Instagram message
*31:05.420- 31:07.680* :  and a photographer sent through the photo and was like,
*31:07.940- 31:09.260* :  I think this could be a world record.
*31:09.740- 31:14.540* :  For months, a team of scientists and engineers poured over photos and video
*31:14.540- 31:18.580* :  of the wave that Laura caught, measuring every centimeter
*31:18.580- 31:20.860* :  to determine the exact size of it.
*31:21.320- 31:25.440* :  And now they finally announced that the 31-year-old did catch
*31:25.440- 31:27.520* :  what's known as a blue wall wave,
*31:28.080- 31:31.120* :  measuring a staggering 13.3 meters.
*31:31.960- 31:35.140* :  There's no doubt that Laura is a fearless surfer,
*31:35.320- 31:38.780* :  but she says showing her parents what she'd done was a little daunting.
*31:39.400- 31:41.460* :  When I showed my family, I'd already told them about the wave
*31:41.500- 31:44.560* :  and then when I showed them, they were kind of like half mad and half proud.
*31:45.960- 31:48.400* :  They were like, oh my goodness, you didn't tell us it was that big.
*31:48.400- 31:49.320* :  Like, what the hell?
