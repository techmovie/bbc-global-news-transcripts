*00:00.300- 00:02.800* :  Sport, but not as you know it.

*00:05.580- 00:08.180* :  Amazing sports stories from the BBC World Service.
*00:08.180- 00:13.020* :  If the story is wriggly, contentious, or hard to tame, I'll cover it.

*00:16.520- 00:20.460* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:22.860- 00:25.420* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Thursday,

*00:28.820- 00:31.820* :  After weeks of conflict between Israel and Hamas,
*00:32.140- 00:34.820* :  some people have been allowed to leave the Gaza Strip.
*00:35.280- 00:39.260* :  The BBC is setting up an emergency radio station for those in Gaza,
*00:39.640- 00:41.840* :  which will begin broadcasting on Friday.
*00:42.660- 00:45.060* :  Donald Trump's elder son has been giving evidence
*00:45.060- 00:47.360* :  at a civil fraud trial in New York.
*00:50.460- 00:52.780* :  Also in this podcast, how climate change
*00:52.780- 00:55.380* :  is affecting tribal communities in Taiwan.
*00:57.540- 01:00.420* :  I have noticed from changes the coffee beans are darker now.
*01:00.600- 01:02.000* :  The weather change is quite obvious.
*01:02.440- 01:05.380* :  Our income is only a few hundred Taiwanese dollars a day
*01:05.740- 01:07.840* :  and a bad harvest can really affect our income.
*01:08.780- 01:12.920* :  And how one man collected hundreds of sandwich recipes.
*01:18.020- 01:20.860* :  For the first time since Gaza was bombed by the Israelis
*01:20.860- 01:24.400* :  following the tour with the 7th attacks carried out by Hamas,
*01:24.780- 01:27.580* :  people have been allowed to leave the Palestinian territory,
*01:27.580- 01:30.060* :  the majority of foreign nationals.
*01:30.300- 01:33.080* :  They left through the Raffa border crossing with Egypt.
*01:33.720- 01:37.620* :  The BBC's Rushdie Abu Alouf in Gaza, who will hear from shortly,
*01:37.620- 01:41.620* :  said that 345 people made it out on Wednesday
*01:42.080- 01:45.000* :  and another 200 will be allowed to leave on Thursday.
*01:45.640- 01:48.280* :  An agreement between Israel, Egypt and Hamas
*01:48.580- 01:52.260* :  to temporarily open the crossing was mediated by Qatar
*01:52.260- 01:54.220* :  with the help of the United States.
*01:54.900- 01:56.940* :  Our correspondent, Farghal Keen, has been working
*01:56.940- 02:01.500* :  with freelance journalists in Gaza and sent us this report from Jerusalem.
*02:05.080- 02:07.680* :  The wounded came by ambulance to Raffa crossing,
*02:07.680- 02:10.620* :  the small space between war and peace,
*02:11.160- 02:12.640* :  between danger and safety.
*02:16.760- 02:18.680* :  Then came the foreign passport holders.
*02:19.620- 02:20.780* :  They're all the lucky ones.
*02:21.160- 02:23.120* :  If luck is having to leave your home,
*02:23.140- 02:26.500* :  to leave your loved ones behind you under bombardment.
*02:27.280- 02:28.740* :  I think we're the past 25 days.
*02:29.400- 02:32.460* :  Every time I share an update with my friends abroad
*02:32.460- 02:33.600* :  that I'm still alive.
*02:34.580- 02:36.620* :  I think we're barely still alive, honestly.
*02:36.920- 02:38.980* :  Tallah Abu Nakhli and her brother Yazid
*02:39.320- 02:41.300* :  have tried three times to leave Gaza.
*02:42.340- 02:45.040* :  He moves by wheelchair and suffers from seizures.
*02:45.980- 02:48.460* :  The family can no longer find medicine to treat him.
*02:48.760- 02:51.720* :  Then once the escalation started
*02:52.280- 02:53.620* :  because he got very afraid,
*02:54.020- 02:56.280* :  the seizures kept getting worse and worse.
*02:56.780- 02:59.020* :  I think every time the situation,
*02:59.420- 03:01.040* :  when I believe it's got to the worst,
*03:01.240- 03:02.380* :  it just keeps getting worse.
*03:02.980- 03:07.440* :  I don't know, it's like we're trying to survive.
*03:07.860- 03:09.140* :  We're not sure we're going to make it.
*03:09.220- 03:11.760* :  We're trying to do anything that we can to do to survive.
*03:13.300- 03:14.800* :  I simply don't want to die at 24.
*03:18.820- 03:21.020* :  In the hospitals of Gaza are the more prevalent
*03:21.020- 03:22.100* :  images of today.
*03:22.780- 03:24.880* :  Not of successful escape from war,
*03:25.420- 03:27.640* :  but of the wounded trapped with no prospect
*03:27.640- 03:28.820* :  of going to Egypt.
*03:29.320- 03:33.160* :  Ayad Abu Hasira is a doctor at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
*03:35.860- 03:38.140* :  The patients ask me if they should go to the south,
*03:38.640- 03:40.000* :  but the south is being bombed
*03:40.300- 03:41.980* :  and the hospitals in the south are crowded.
*03:42.420- 03:43.760* :  Or should they stay in Gaza?
*03:44.520- 03:46.460* :  They ask me if they can stay in the hospital here.
*03:46.940- 03:47.900* :  But it is also crowded,
*03:48.540- 03:49.620* :  and we have no place for them.
*03:50.480- 03:51.940* :  We do not know how we can treat them.
*03:52.980- 03:53.980* :  We feel sorry for them,
*03:54.320- 03:56.460* :  because we can't provide them with any services,
*03:56.640- 03:58.580* :  although the hospital is open.
*04:01.100- 04:03.140* :  Sitting among the crowds waiting her turn
*04:03.140- 04:05.380* :  to approach the border officials was Mona,
*04:05.860- 04:08.340* :  a young native of Gaza married to an Australian.
*04:09.120- 04:10.820* :  She clutched her Australian passport,
*04:11.440- 04:13.660* :  constantly checking her phone from messages
*04:14.180- 04:16.300* :  from the family she's left behind in Gaza.
*04:17.160- 04:19.360* :  She's haunted to be leaving without them.
*04:19.960- 04:21.260* :  I'm not happy at all,
*04:21.260- 04:24.040* :  that's because I'm leaving my other part,
*04:24.220- 04:25.200* :  my brother and sister,
*04:25.200- 04:26.940* :  my whole family is still here.
*04:28.240- 04:32.800* :  I wish each Allah out of their own place,
*04:34.240- 04:35.940* :  situation is terrible there.
*04:35.940- 04:37.520* :  It's very, very bad.
*04:39.080- 04:41.920* :  Mona ending that report by Fergal Keen.
*04:42.540- 04:46.080* :  Egypt said it expected 90 seriously wounded people
*04:46.080- 04:48.040* :  to have left Gaza by Thursday.
*04:48.040- 04:52.040* :  Rushdie Abu al-Aluf has spent the day at the Rafa Crossing.
*04:52.500- 04:54.400* :  20 meter from here is another gate,
*04:54.920- 04:56.220* :  designed to go for cars.
*04:56.340- 05:01.080* :  And we have seen about 2030 ambulances carrying those
*05:01.080- 05:04.420* :  who are seriously wounded by the Israeli war
*05:04.700- 05:05.480* :  from different hospitals,
*05:05.480- 05:06.880* :  including Nasr Hospital,
*05:06.880- 05:09.500* :  where I was reporting all the time.
*05:09.820- 05:11.700* :  And they were taken now to the Egyptian side,
*05:11.740- 05:12.820* :  because people were injured,
*05:12.820- 05:14.940* :  and they take a little bit of time,
*05:14.940- 05:17.240* :  because they don't have any IDs or any busports
*05:17.240- 05:17.880* :  for the Egyptian,
*05:18.360- 05:20.900* :  will have to identify them and make sure
*05:20.900- 05:22.420* :  that they are their identity,
*05:22.420- 05:25.980* :  and then they will be transported into a field hospital outside
*05:26.380- 05:28.080* :  this crossing near 10 kilometers,
*05:28.520- 05:32.280* :  and from there they will be taken to farther treatment in Egypt.
*05:32.320- 05:35.380* :  But this is a very big significant people
*05:35.380- 05:37.300* :  for about 7,000 Palestinians
*05:37.760- 05:38.860* :  who have dual national,
*05:38.920- 05:40.680* :  and they were waiting for days
*05:41.040- 05:41.920* :  to have this chance,
*05:41.920- 05:45.200* :  but also for tens of thousands of injured people,
*05:45.200- 05:46.980* :  including many children and women
*05:46.980- 05:49.720* :  who are waiting for this gate to be opened,
*05:49.720- 05:52.900* :  so they can be sinned for medical treatment.
*05:53.780- 05:54.700* :  Well, as you just heard,
*05:54.700- 05:57.680* :  thousands of foreign nationals remain in Gaza,
*05:58.140- 05:58.840* :  and some of them,
*05:58.880- 06:00.200* :  even if they're given the chance,
*06:00.580- 06:01.580* :  are unsure of leaving,
*06:02.100- 06:03.460* :  such as Muhammad Galaini,
*06:03.640- 06:05.400* :  a scientist from Manchester in England,
*06:05.400- 06:07.480* :  who traveled to Gaza in September,
*06:07.800- 06:08.700* :  to visit his family.
*06:09.020- 06:09.800* :  People are desperate,
*06:09.800- 06:14.220* :  in terms of how afraid they are of what's been going on
*06:14.220- 06:16.840* :  and that these radio attacks have left so many,
*06:16.840- 06:18.200* :  so many Palestinians dead,
*06:18.720- 06:19.460* :  how many others injured.
*06:19.920- 06:23.580* :  So people are really afraid of what's going on.
*06:23.960- 06:25.280* :  So if they have a chance to leave,
*06:25.280- 06:26.180* :  they're trying to leave.
*06:26.960- 06:27.680* :  On the one hand,
*06:27.680- 06:29.820* :  I want to be somewhere where I turn a tap on
*06:29.840- 06:31.440* :  and have water, flick a switch,
*06:31.440- 06:32.240* :  and have electricity,
*06:32.240- 06:35.540* :  where I am not afraid of dying
*06:35.540- 06:37.340* :  of a waterborne disease or dying
*06:37.340- 06:39.540* :  because of an easy treatable illness
*06:39.540- 06:41.900* :  because the primary care system has fallen apart.
*06:41.900- 06:44.920* :  Women are giving birth without general anesthetic,
*06:45.140- 06:47.040* :  having c-section without anesthetic.
*06:47.040- 06:48.560* :  That's how dire it is.
*06:49.240- 06:50.980* :  You know, with great power or privilege
*06:50.980- 06:52.140* :  comes great responsibility.
*06:52.160- 06:53.900* :  And I think that I'm one of those people
*06:53.900- 06:55.220* :  that is in a position of privilege.
*06:55.820- 06:57.400* :  I know that I can be useful here on the ground.
*06:58.140- 07:00.560* :  So like odds are, I'd probably be staying.
*07:01.420- 07:02.740* :  Muhammad Galaini,
*07:03.400- 07:05.240* :  according to the health ministry in Gaza,
*07:05.240- 07:06.620* :  which is run by Hamas,
*07:07.060- 07:09.240* :  the number of those killed by Israeli bombings
*07:09.240- 07:12.120* :  since the start of the war is nearly 9,000.
*07:12.140- 07:15.300* :  The United Nations said that 70% of the dead
*07:15.300- 07:16.600* :  are women and children.
*07:17.320- 07:18.700* :  1,400 people in Israel,
*07:18.700- 07:21.200* :  mainly civilians, were massacred by Hamas,
*07:21.640- 07:24.000* :  which still holds more than 200 hostages
*07:24.400- 07:25.740* :  according to the Israeli government.
*07:26.400- 07:29.120* :  Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes have continued pounding
*07:29.120- 07:31.840* :  what the army says are Hamas targets
*07:32.360- 07:34.560* :  as the fighters designated as terrorists
*07:34.560- 07:36.460* :  by the US and other Western countries,
*07:36.940- 07:38.460* :  fired rockets into Israel.
*07:39.300- 07:41.220* :  Civilians in Gaza were urged by Israel
*07:41.220- 07:43.080* :  to go south for their own safety.
*07:43.480- 07:44.200* :  A fear of folk,
*07:44.200- 07:46.740* :  a foreign policy adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister
*07:47.220- 07:49.400* :  was asked by the BBC about casualties.
*07:50.020- 07:52.600* :  Israel is in full complete compliance
*07:52.600- 07:53.700* :  with international law.
*07:53.700- 07:56.080* :  We seek to minimize civilian casualties.
*07:56.080- 07:58.020* :  We do everything possible
*07:58.720- 08:01.160* :  to minimize civilian casualties.
*08:01.600- 08:03.200* :  We even take risks sometimes
*08:03.720- 08:06.780* :  to minimize civilian casualties.
*08:08.240- 08:10.140* :  I'm not aware of any bombings in the south
*08:10.840- 08:12.760* :  and that is a safer zone.
*08:13.420- 08:15.660* :  Meanwhile, there appears to have been another attack
*08:15.660- 08:18.400* :  on the Jabaliyah refugee camp near Gaza City.
*08:18.900- 08:20.460* :  I asked our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*08:20.460- 08:22.200* :  John Donerson, to tell us more.
*08:22.680- 08:23.560* :  Well, look, it certainly seems
*08:23.600- 08:25.660* :  that way our correspondence in southern Israel
*08:25.660- 08:29.320* :  saw large plumes of black smoke coming up
*08:29.480- 08:30.820* :  from the Jabaliyah area,
*08:30.820- 08:33.520* :  pictures on the ground in Jabaliyah,
*08:33.520- 08:36.220* :  which frankly has been flattened, really,
*08:36.700- 08:38.160* :  over the last three and a half weeks,
*08:38.160- 08:41.080* :  show another large crater emergency workers
*08:41.560- 08:43.600* :  trying to pull people from the rubble.
*08:43.600- 08:46.900* :  And of course, this comes after an Israeli strike
*08:46.900- 08:48.960* :  or strikes in Jabaliyah yesterday
*08:48.960- 08:52.500* :  in which Palestinian health officials in Gaza
*08:53.160- 08:54.800* :  as well as the United Nations say
*08:54.800- 08:56.360* :  around 50 people were killed
*08:56.920- 08:58.480* :  and 150 people injured.
*08:58.480- 09:00.020* :  On that occasion, Israel said
*09:00.060- 09:03.680* :  that it was targeting a tunnel network in Jabaliyah
*09:03.700- 09:05.400* :  and they hit an area of open ground
*09:06.000- 09:08.700* :  that brought buildings round it down.
*09:08.740- 09:12.380* :  They've not commented on these latest strikes
*09:12.980- 09:14.780* :  on Jabaliyah this afternoon,
*09:14.940- 09:18.040* :  but it does seem they are intensifying
*09:18.040- 09:20.020* :  their bombardment in northern Gaza.
*09:20.020- 09:21.600* :  They released some figures today saying
*09:21.620- 09:23.200* :  that since the start of the war,
*09:23.720- 09:26.280* :  some 10,000 munitions, bombs,
*09:26.860- 09:30.260* :  tank shells have been fired into Gaza City alone.
*09:30.720- 09:31.500* :  Well, John, Philippe,
*09:31.680- 09:33.340* :  Lazarini, the head of the UN Agency
*09:33.340- 09:34.620* :  for Palestinian refugees,
*09:34.620- 09:38.260* :  has visited Gaza for the first time since the fighting began.
*09:38.600- 09:40.180* :  Let's hear some of what here to say.
*09:40.700- 09:45.340* :  I was chucked by the fact that everyone there
*09:45.900- 09:49.700* :  was asking for food, was asking for water.
*09:50.240- 09:54.980* :  We saw almost every children trying to express their way
*09:55.040- 09:57.920* :  that they need to eat, they need to have water.
*09:58.560- 10:02.360* :  I never ever have seen something similar in Gaza
*10:02.360- 10:05.080* :  when I came before after conflict.
*10:05.340- 10:07.360* :  And that was the UN's Philippe, Lazarini,
*10:07.360- 10:10.940* :  Sir John, any word on more aid getting into Gaza.
*10:11.440- 10:13.020* :  Well, a limited number of trucks
*10:13.520- 10:15.500* :  are coming into Gaza each day,
*10:15.500- 10:18.540* :  but the United Nations, Palestinians in Gaza say
*10:18.540- 10:20.980* :  it is just a fraction of what is needed
*10:21.060- 10:23.700* :  and we're just getting a completely different version
*10:23.760- 10:26.680* :  of events in terms of the humanitarian situation
*10:26.900- 10:28.340* :  on the ground from the Israeli side
*10:28.340- 10:29.640* :  and from the Palestinian side.
*10:29.920- 10:31.560* :  We had a briefing from the Israeli military
*10:31.980- 10:34.000* :  where they were saying there were no shortages
*10:34.500- 10:36.560* :  of food, water and fuel.
*10:36.560- 10:38.900* :  They said specifically with relation to fuel,
*10:38.940- 10:40.320* :  Hamas is stockpiling it.
*10:40.480- 10:41.300* :  On the other hand,
*10:41.300- 10:44.220* :  you've got the United Nations humanitarian chief,
*10:44.220- 10:45.120* :  Martin Griffiths,
*10:45.480- 10:48.120* :  today issuing a statement saying in Gaza,
*10:48.120- 10:51.020* :  women, children and men are being starved,
*10:51.380- 10:53.080* :  traumatized and bombed to death.
*10:53.360- 10:55.000* :  They've lost all faith in humanity
*10:55.440- 10:57.060* :  and all hope of the future.
*10:57.260- 10:59.080* :  Their despair is palpable.
*10:59.120- 11:01.020* :  We've heard news today that the last remaining
*11:01.540- 11:04.760* :  cancer hospital in Gaza has had to shut down
*11:04.760- 11:07.200* :  because of a lack of fuel according to health officials.
*11:08.060- 11:10.520* :  There are warnings that children are suffering
*11:10.520- 11:11.740* :  from dehydration.
*11:11.740- 11:14.560* :  Israel says it's turned a limited amount of water
*11:14.560- 11:16.260* :  back on into southern Gaza,
*11:16.580- 11:20.000* :  but normally Israel supplies only 10% of Gaza's water.
*11:20.620- 11:23.180* :  And without fuel, you can't get it out the pumps.
*11:23.380- 11:26.440* :  The rest of the water in Gaza is pretty much undrinkable
*11:26.980- 11:28.440* :  without desalination plants,
*11:29.200- 11:30.600* :  also dependent on fuel.
*11:31.420- 11:33.100* :  John Donerson in Jerusalem.
*11:34.080- 11:37.620* :  The BBC World Service is launching an emergency radio service
*11:37.620- 11:41.000* :  for Gaza on medium wave as response to the conflict.
*11:41.460- 11:43.220* :  The broadcast will be called Gaza Daily
*11:43.580- 11:46.520* :  and will get underway at 1500 hours GMT
*11:46.520- 11:48.920* :  starting on Friday, the 3rd of November.
*11:49.540- 11:52.060* :  Leigh Ann Lando, the director of BBC World Service,
*11:52.060- 11:53.180* :  Yeh Porti-Tels.
*11:53.600- 11:59.560* :  This is something that the BBC has a history of doing.
*11:59.560- 12:05.700* :  When the United Nations called the situation in Gaza
*12:05.700- 12:07.500* :  yesterday a human catastrophe
*12:07.540- 12:11.800* :  and the World Health Organization spoke of a health catastrophe,
*12:11.800- 12:14.940* :  the World Service decided to respond
*12:14.940- 12:18.220* :  as the World Service does the emergency situation.
*12:18.360- 12:21.540* :  So we did it in Sudan, not too long ago.
*12:21.840- 12:23.480* :  We suddenly did it in Ukraine
*12:23.480- 12:26.920* :  where we extended our TV bulletins in Sudan.
*12:26.920- 12:28.820* :  We had an emergency radio service
*12:28.820- 12:31.000* :  and we're doing it now in Gaza.
*12:31.600- 12:34.260* :  We're calling this emergency radio service.
*12:34.260- 12:37.540* :  It is daily twice a day
*12:38.060- 12:41.700* :  and it will broadcast essential news
*12:41.700- 12:43.180* :  to the people of Gaza,
*12:43.760- 12:47.280* :  essential news, meaning latest information and developments,
*12:47.280- 12:51.320* :  but also safety advice where you can access shelter,
*12:51.320- 12:53.260* :  water supplies, food.
*12:53.680- 12:57.780* :  You don't even have basic electricity supplies in Gaza.
*12:57.780- 13:02.140* :  So we're hoping that people will access us on small radios
*13:02.800- 13:06.060* :  and the BBC is trusted in the region.
*13:06.160- 13:08.800* :  The BBC is trusted more than any other broadcaster
*13:08.980- 13:11.700* :  and we're hoping that as soon as we announce
*13:11.860- 13:13.940* :  that we've got this daily radio service
*13:14.040- 13:15.800* :  that people will come to it simply
*13:15.800- 13:20.960* :  because of what the BBC means to the Arab world at the moment.
*13:21.380- 13:24.280* :  Lillian Landour, 25 days have passed
*13:24.280- 13:28.120* :  since the Hamas terror attacks sparked Israel's military response
*13:28.140- 13:30.580* :  at the number of dead is rising rapidly.
*13:31.220- 13:33.380* :  The Hamas-run Palestinian Health Authority
*13:33.860- 13:36.820* :  says more than 8,000 people have been killed in Gaza.
*13:37.400- 13:40.640* :  1,400 people were killed in the Hamas attacks in Israel
*13:40.980- 13:42.120* :  on October the 7th
*13:42.560- 13:45.220* :  and 15 Israeli soldiers have died in the fighting.
*13:46.020- 13:49.440* :  The United Nations is calling the conflict a global crisis.
*13:50.300- 13:53.040* :  Our international editor, Jeremy Boone, has this analysis.
*13:53.640- 13:57.020* :  The statement from the UN's humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths
*13:57.380- 13:58.680* :  could not be starker.
*13:59.100- 14:02.980* :  Palestinian civilians in Gaza are he says suffering atrocities
*14:03.600- 14:06.900* :  which would leave indelible scars on the lives of millions.
*14:07.760- 14:09.660* :  And as for Israel, Mr. Griffith says
*14:10.140- 14:13.360* :  it was left in shock after the brutal and graphic killing
*14:13.840- 14:15.400* :  of some 1,400 people.
*14:16.000- 14:20.180* :  The world he says seems unable or unwilling to act.
*14:20.720- 14:23.760* :  Humanitarian pauses in the fighting had to happen
*14:24.400- 14:25.900* :  and all the hostages released.
*14:26.520- 14:29.820* :  The despair evident in that statement from the UN shows
*14:29.820- 14:32.980* :  the depth of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza
*14:33.540- 14:36.120* :  as Israeli troops move further into the strip.
*14:36.720- 14:39.120* :  Israel's determination to carry on with the mission
*14:39.120- 14:40.160* :  to destroy Hamas
*14:40.680- 14:43.520* :  is fueled by the rage and sadness over the killings
*14:43.520- 14:45.380* :  by Hamas on the 7th of October.
*14:46.000- 14:48.240* :  A sign of a hard fight ahead
*14:48.240- 14:51.380* :  is that Israeli soldiers are being killed in Gaza
*14:51.860- 14:54.060* :  before they've tried to enter what could become
*14:54.060- 14:56.820* :  an urban battlefield in Gaza City.
*14:57.400- 14:59.540* :  Israelis are united about hitting back
*14:59.540- 15:01.000* :  and they're behind their army.
*15:01.460- 15:04.280* :  The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on the other hand,
*15:04.280- 15:05.260* :  is under great pressure.
*15:05.780- 15:09.220* :  Security and military chiefs have taken responsibility
*15:10.000- 15:11.400* :  for mistakes made on their watch.
*15:11.780- 15:13.220* :  Mr. Netanyahu has not.
*15:13.840- 15:16.000* :  His enemies in Israel are circling.
*15:16.480- 15:20.220* :  Tension across the region caused by the risks of a wider war
*15:20.560- 15:21.280* :  is still high.
*15:21.540- 15:24.340* :  The Iranian foreign minister is threatening dire
*15:24.340- 15:26.720* :  if unspecified consequences
*15:26.740- 15:30.100* :  if Israel continues its attacks in Gaza.
*15:30.680- 15:33.260* :  And Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel,
*15:33.260- 15:36.500* :  has recalled its ambassador for consultations.
*15:37.880- 15:38.440* :  Joby Bird.
*15:41.460- 15:42.840* :  Still to come on this podcast,
*15:42.840- 15:47.320* :  how the Italian Prime Minister fell victim to Russian pranksters.
*15:55.120- 15:57.980* :  Heat waves, floods, droughts, wildfires,
*15:58.180- 16:00.940* :  catastrophic consequences from climate change.
*16:00.940- 16:02.440* :  What's going on is this real.
*16:02.720- 16:04.320* :  The climate question is the podcast
*16:05.060- 16:06.720* :  exploring our planet's changing environment.
*16:06.760- 16:10.140* :  And what we're doing across the world to adapt and respond to it.
*16:10.140- 16:13.400* :  The futures ahead of us are very sensitive to the choices
*16:13.740- 16:14.560* :  that make today.
*16:14.560- 16:17.200* :  If we don't start fixing it, we're going to move victims of it.
*16:17.260- 16:18.020* :  Can't engage.
*16:18.020- 16:20.840* :  The climate question from the BBC World Service
*16:21.240- 16:23.420* :  find it wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
*16:25.400- 16:26.100* :  Welcome back.
*16:26.660- 16:29.740* :  The first global artificial intelligence safety summit
*16:29.740- 16:33.920* :  due to last two days is underway at Bletchley Park outside London
*16:34.380- 16:36.560* :  where the British code breakers of World War II
*16:37.000- 16:39.000* :  work to decipher enemy messages.
*16:39.620- 16:42.880* :  Delegates from leading AI countries and experts in the field
*16:42.880- 16:46.940* :  are discussing the future of the technology and how to control it.
*16:47.440- 16:50.560* :  On Wednesday, countries including the US, UK, and China
*16:50.920- 16:52.460* :  signed the Bletchley Declaration,
*16:52.460- 16:56.260* :  which promises to safeguard against the risks of AI.
*16:56.960- 16:59.020* :  Our technology editor, Zoe Kleiman, was there.
*16:59.460- 17:02.800* :  The Bletchley Declaration came as a surprise so early on in the day,
*17:03.240- 17:05.220* :  but set the momentum for an ambitious event
*17:05.220- 17:06.660* :  built as a world first.
*17:07.480- 17:10.980* :  The focus of the discussions was the scariest of worst-case scenarios
*17:11.500- 17:14.240* :  as set out by the US Vice President, Kamala Harris.
*17:14.800- 17:18.580* :  From AI enabled cyber attacks at a scale beyond anything
*17:18.580- 17:22.180* :  we've seen before, to AI formulated bio-weapons.
*17:23.360- 17:27.800* :  These threats are often referred to as the existential threats
*17:27.800- 17:31.300* :  of AI because, of course, they could endanger
*17:31.980- 17:34.080* :  the very existence of humanity.
*17:34.580- 17:38.960* :  These threats, without question, demand global action.
*17:39.320- 17:42.100* :  Rishi Sunak's aim is for the UK to lead that action,
*17:42.460- 17:46.120* :  setting the UK up as a kind of global referee for AI safety.
*17:46.440- 17:48.780* :  We can't expect these companies to mark their own homework
*17:49.320- 17:51.040* :  and that has to be the responsibility of governments.
*17:51.480- 17:53.720* :  But then, as the companies have already done,
*17:53.760- 17:56.760* :  it's given access to the UK to look at these models
*17:57.200- 17:59.000* :  before they're released to work with them
*17:59.320- 18:01.340* :  so that we can do the testing that is necessary
*18:01.340- 18:03.700* :  to make sure that we are keeping our citizens
*18:03.700- 18:05.160* :  and everyone at home safe.
*18:05.520- 18:07.140* :  But there's a growing chorus of voices
*18:07.140- 18:09.580* :  who fear that the summit has its priorities wrong.
*18:09.980- 18:12.100* :  There are threats that are far closer to home
*18:12.100- 18:13.440* :  for many people, they say.
*18:13.720- 18:16.740* :  In the short-term, an AI tool is more likely to replace you
*18:16.740- 18:18.920* :  in your job or display bias against you.
*18:19.440- 18:21.820* :  The government's already announced two future summits,
*18:22.100- 18:24.180* :  one in South Korea in six months' time,
*18:24.540- 18:25.840* :  to continue these discussions.
*18:26.520- 18:29.220* :  Time will tell whether the bletchly crowd got it right.
*18:30.100- 18:30.820* :  Zoe Kleinman.
*18:31.720- 18:34.480* :  Donald Trump, Jr., the former president's eldest son
*18:34.480- 18:37.140* :  has told a court in New York he had little to do
*18:37.140- 18:40.640* :  with the financial documents at the family's real estate company.
*18:40.920- 18:43.140* :  He and his brother Eric and sister Ivanka
*18:43.480- 18:45.980* :  are senior executives in the Trump organization
*18:45.980- 18:49.580* :  and co-defendants in the case along with their father, Donald.
*18:50.240- 18:52.240* :  They're all accused of falsification
*18:52.240- 18:55.500* :  of business records, insurance fraud and conspiracy.
*18:56.160- 18:58.620* :  A New York correspondent, Nettoffick, Tomi Moore.
*18:59.120- 19:01.260* :  People need to realize that Donald Trump, Jr.
*19:01.260- 19:03.200* :  is the most outspoken politically
*19:03.220- 19:05.080* :  of all of Donald Trump's children.
*19:05.080- 19:06.460* :  You know, he's really echoed
*19:06.460- 19:08.460* :  a lot of what his father has said about this case,
*19:08.880- 19:12.200* :  calling it a sham, calling it essentially a witch hunt.
*19:12.700- 19:15.060* :  But today in court, the tone was fairly light.
*19:15.060- 19:18.200* :  So he was joking often with the judge at one point
*19:18.200- 19:20.760* :  when the judge asked him to speak slowly.
*19:21.260- 19:23.380* :  He joked that he had moved to Florida
*19:23.380- 19:24.860* :  but had kept the New York pace.
*19:25.740- 19:28.220* :  But then when it came to really the substance of this case
*19:28.260- 19:30.460* :  because remember, he is not just a witness in this.
*19:30.460- 19:34.220* :  He is a defendant and he has been said to, you know,
*19:35.080- 19:39.020* :  given his role as a trustee of Donald Trump's entire empire
*19:39.020- 19:42.000* :  when his father became president, prosecutors said
*19:42.020- 19:43.760* :  he was the one who was signing off
*19:43.780- 19:45.360* :  on all of the financial documents
*19:45.360- 19:46.920* :  attesting to their accuracy
*19:47.600- 19:49.600* :  when they were sent to financial institutions.
*19:50.300- 19:52.160* :  But on the stand, he said, you know,
*19:52.160- 19:54.100* :  that's what I have accountants for.
*19:54.280- 19:57.020* :  I'm not familiar with general accounting principles.
*19:57.700- 19:59.380* :  I didn't compile these statements.
*19:59.440- 20:02.160* :  That was something that I relied on my accountants
*20:02.180- 20:04.520* :  and staff to do and eventually will hear
*20:04.520- 20:06.580* :  from the former president himself, won't we?
*20:06.920- 20:09.480* :  He didn't show up to hear his children testify
*20:09.480- 20:11.520* :  because he is planning for a few rallies.
*20:12.220- 20:13.680* :  But he will be here next week.
*20:13.680- 20:15.640* :  I had actually asked him at the start of the trial
*20:15.640- 20:18.180* :  if he planned to testify and he said he did.
*20:18.740- 20:20.040* :  But you know, many legal experts
*20:20.040- 20:21.820* :  have said that he would be wise
*20:22.220- 20:24.020* :  to invoke his fifth amendment right
*20:24.020- 20:25.520* :  against self-incrimination.
*20:26.120- 20:30.920* :  Completely, if not at least on, particularly, you know,
*20:30.920- 20:32.820* :  troubled, troubled some questions
*20:32.820- 20:36.620* :  that could get him into issues of if he intended to defraud
*20:36.620- 20:38.700* :  because they say that could be used
*20:38.700- 20:41.700* :  in any of his pending criminal indictments.
*20:42.380- 20:44.080* :  Neutotopic in New York.
*20:44.940- 20:47.000* :  The Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Maloney,
*20:47.000- 20:50.160* :  has fallen prey to a telephone prank call
*20:50.520- 20:52.760* :  by an imposter pretending to be the head
*20:52.760- 20:54.460* :  of the African Union Commission
*20:54.460- 20:57.900* :  in the run-up to talks with African leaders at the UN.
*20:58.540- 21:01.060* :  Ms. Maloney was asked about Russia's war in Ukraine,
*21:01.060- 21:03.540* :  the migration crisis, and her view
*21:03.540- 21:06.040* :  on French President Emmanuel Macron.
*21:06.740- 21:08.480* :  Our Europe editor, Danny Eberhard,
*21:08.480- 21:09.640* :  takes up the story.
*21:10.060- 21:11.780* :  It's a well-worn trick that the Russians,
*21:11.780- 21:13.860* :  nicknamed Vivane and Lexus,
*21:14.140- 21:15.420* :  have been deploying for years.
*21:16.100- 21:18.020* :  It's embarrassing for Prime Minister Maloney,
*21:18.380- 21:21.320* :  but she wasn't lured into any spectacular indiscretions.
*21:21.880- 21:24.700* :  Most sensitive, perhaps, was when she told the fake diplomat
*21:24.920- 21:27.980* :  that all sides felt much fatigue about the war in Ukraine,
*21:28.040- 21:30.100* :  which she said could last many years.
*21:30.780- 21:32.180* :  She said it was approaching the point
*21:32.180- 21:33.540* :  where a way out was needed,
*21:34.060- 21:35.860* :  but she stressed this would have to be acceptable
*21:35.860- 21:38.900* :  to both sides without destroying international law.
*21:39.520- 21:41.080* :  She also emphasized her backing
*21:41.080- 21:43.840* :  for Ukraine's struggle against invading Russian forces
*21:44.420- 21:46.340* :  and signaled her unwillingness to succumb
*21:46.340- 21:48.360* :  to any potential blackmail by Moscow,
*21:48.860- 21:51.240* :  amid efforts to restart a Black Sea grain deal.
*21:51.900- 21:53.700* :  The Italian government says the prank call
*21:53.700- 21:55.140* :  took place in mid-September,
*21:55.500- 21:57.060* :  when Ms. Maloney was pursuing efforts
*21:57.060- 21:59.080* :  to strengthen relations with African leaders
*21:59.500- 22:01.720* :  on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
*22:02.360- 22:03.180* :  Danny Eberhard.
*22:03.960- 22:06.560* :  In January, the people of Taiwan will go to the polls
*22:06.560- 22:07.840* :  to elect a new president.
*22:07.940- 22:10.520* :  The main topics for many are the economy
*22:10.520- 22:12.080* :  and relations with China,
*22:12.620- 22:14.820* :  but there are also voices calling for more action
*22:14.940- 22:16.120* :  on climate change.
*22:16.640- 22:20.580* :  Taiwan relies on seasonal typhoons as a source of water,
*22:21.120- 22:23.260* :  but there are concerns that because of climate change,
*22:23.260- 22:26.620* :  these storms are moving north away from the island.
*22:27.460- 22:30.260* :  Nilema Govern has been to the central region of Taiwan
*22:30.260- 22:33.060* :  to see some of the effects of climate change
*22:33.460- 22:34.980* :  on the tribal populations.
*22:38.680- 22:40.200* :  I'm at the home of the so,
*22:40.520- 22:42.660* :  one of Taiwan's indigenous communities.
*22:46.480- 22:48.660* :  Today, here, by the side of a mountain,
*22:49.040- 22:51.680* :  a children's musical competition is kicking off
*22:52.060- 22:53.440* :  at the bean of life festival.
*22:54.260- 22:56.620* :  The bean is an ingredient used in their cooking,
*22:56.620- 22:58.700* :  but it also represents resilience.
*23:00.980- 23:03.580* :  I've now gone farther into the so community
*23:04.120- 23:05.940* :  and walked down steep wooden steps,
*23:06.000- 23:08.240* :  passed the tribe's Cuba ceremony hall,
*23:08.680- 23:11.100* :  and into a valley of lush vegetation.
*23:11.740- 23:14.040* :  There are deep green coffee plants surrounding me,
*23:14.240- 23:16.140* :  and the Alishan mountains in the distance.
*23:16.920- 23:18.160* :  I'm with Cheng Zhao.
*23:18.880- 23:21.580* :  Her family has been planting bamboo for generations,
*23:21.580- 23:25.180* :  but in recent years, continuous droughts have forced them
*23:25.180- 23:26.960* :  to look at other crops, like coffee.
*23:29.760- 23:32.440* :  Zhao owns a little stall where she sells her coffee
*23:32.440- 23:34.020* :  right beside where it's grown,
*23:34.600- 23:36.500* :  but climate change is an issue.
*23:41.240- 23:42.380* :  I have noticed some changes.
*23:42.820- 23:44.120* :  The coffee beans are darker now.
*23:44.640- 23:46.000* :  The weather changes quite obvious.
*23:46.800- 23:49.700* :  Our income is only a few hundred Taiwanese dollars a day,
*23:50.060- 23:52.180* :  and a bad harvest can really affect our income.
*23:52.780- 23:56.860* :  Listening to Zhao speak is the so-tribelder Gao Disheng,
*23:57.260- 23:58.440* :  who wants to sound the alarm,
*23:58.440- 24:00.740* :  not only about how livelihoods are affected,
*24:01.320- 24:03.600* :  but also about the threat to their sacred traditions
*24:03.600- 24:06.520* :  that are integral to so culture and mythology.
*24:07.320- 24:09.440* :  I asked him what changes he is seeing.
*24:10.200- 24:14.520* :  If you want to talk about this,
*24:14.680- 24:17.460* :  I need to talk about our culture first.
*24:18.480- 24:20.840* :  Our society is based on hunting and agriculture.
*24:21.920- 24:25.180* :  Hunting deer or wild boars is very important for us.
*24:25.700- 24:27.940* :  In the old days, we used to farm crops that we ate,
*24:28.360- 24:30.180* :  but now we mostly farm crops,
*24:30.220- 24:32.440* :  like millet or china oil tree,
*24:32.820- 24:34.280* :  that we can sell in the market.
*24:34.940- 24:37.000* :  Now, the changes you are talking about
*24:37.440- 24:39.180* :  are greatly affecting our lives,
*24:39.700- 24:41.500* :  especially our rituals and ceremonies.
*24:42.420- 24:44.080* :  Can you complete your rituals,
*24:44.080- 24:48.140* :  your ritual ceremonies without these certain plants?
*24:49.160- 24:55.340* :  The flower, which we call the god flower,
*24:55.840- 24:57.620* :  is essential for our rituals,
*24:58.320- 25:02.360* :  and god comes down to earth only when he sees this flower.
*25:03.080- 25:04.120* :  It used to be everywhere,
*25:04.620- 25:07.720* :  but now we have to go high into the mountain to find it.
*25:08.120- 25:10.520* :  What do you think will happen to the tribe?
*25:14.180- 25:15.860* :  We have to plan a new future,
*25:16.560- 25:19.800* :  and it depends on what support we get from the government.
*25:20.920- 25:22.820* :  We get visits by the politicians,
*25:23.820- 25:26.760* :  but they don't really address the serious problems,
*25:27.240- 25:28.080* :  like climate change.
*25:28.480- 25:31.140* :  A few weeks ago, the environmental group Greenpeace
*25:31.360- 25:33.280* :  called Taiwan's presidential candidates
*25:33.280- 25:36.580* :  climate snails for their environmental platforms.
*25:36.580- 25:38.860* :  They warned that extreme weather events
*25:38.860- 25:41.800* :  are already impacting parts of Taiwan's heritage,
*25:42.380- 25:43.840* :  including the indigenous tribes,
*25:44.420- 25:47.260* :  who they see as being on the front line of climate change.
*25:47.820- 25:49.260* :  So let us return to the tribe
*25:49.260- 25:50.840* :  and the Bean of Life Festival,
*25:51.260- 25:52.900* :  where the so children were competing
*25:52.900- 25:54.660* :  with their colorful headdresses,
*25:55.120- 25:57.640* :  adorned with pom-poms and also shells.
*25:58.440- 26:00.900* :  News has come in that they have come second,
*26:01.040- 26:02.500* :  and I may be biased,
*26:02.900- 26:04.800* :  but I think they should have won.
*26:07.420- 26:07.440* :  Taiwan.
*26:13.240- 26:15.420* :  Nulamagavan in Central Taiwan.
*26:16.760- 26:18.940* :  And finally, a journey around the world,
*26:18.940- 26:20.880* :  and through time, well,
*26:21.120- 26:22.500* :  certainly when it comes to sandwiches,
*26:23.080- 26:24.800* :  as we look at Barry Endowick,
*26:25.080- 26:26.880* :  a man who has dedicated his life
*26:26.880- 26:31.200* :  to recreating and logging more than 700 sandwich recipes
*26:31.560- 26:32.100* :  through history,
*26:32.720- 26:34.980* :  from which you believe 200 BC
*26:35.380- 26:36.320* :  to the present day.
*26:36.840- 26:38.860* :  And his favourite may surprise you,
*26:39.060- 26:40.320* :  a Stephanie Prentice report.
*26:40.920- 26:42.380* :  Toasted bread, mayonnaise,
*26:42.860- 26:44.580* :  tomatoes with salt and pepper,
*26:44.580- 26:47.540* :  roasted sunflower seeds and herbs.
*26:48.460- 26:49.920* :  We taught that with a bunch of herbs,
*26:50.680- 26:52.060* :  specifically dill and lots of it,
*26:52.740- 26:54.040* :  basil and lots of it,
*26:54.140- 26:56.360* :  and a big ol' squeeze lemon juice over everything.
*26:57.220- 26:59.440* :  That is the best sandwich of all time,
*26:59.540- 27:01.240* :  according to Barry Endowick,
*27:01.540- 27:02.700* :  and he would know.
*27:03.260- 27:04.720* :  He's been coming recipe books,
*27:04.880- 27:07.600* :  history books and traveling to different countries
*27:07.600- 27:11.780* :  and restaurants to test out as many sandwiches as possible,
*27:12.560- 27:14.180* :  including chopped raw oysters,
*27:14.720- 27:15.360* :  bad apparently,
*27:15.920- 27:19.200* :  and a sesame beef with fennel from 200 BC.
*27:19.840- 27:20.720* :  Good, apparently.
*27:21.220- 27:22.120* :  I'm just winging it.
*27:22.700- 27:23.640* :  So in a bowl, we mix together.
*27:23.640- 27:25.460* :  What began, as posting on Instagram,
*27:25.540- 27:28.680* :  asking for recipes has turned into a daily creation
*27:28.680- 27:30.660* :  for hundreds of thousands of viewers
*27:31.060- 27:32.740* :  on his social media accounts.
*27:33.500- 27:34.640* :  How do we put that onto a bread?
*27:34.960- 27:36.920* :  He now identifies as a one-man
*27:37.600- 27:39.020* :  historical reenaction society,
*27:39.600- 27:41.300* :  saying that following things like bread
*27:41.300- 27:42.700* :  and fillings through history
*27:43.120- 27:46.080* :  is a way to learn about cultural and societal shifts,
*27:46.800- 27:48.360* :  like the ped down recipes
*27:48.360- 27:50.940* :  during America's depression in the 30s,
*27:51.660- 27:53.140* :  and the larger portion sizes
*27:53.140- 27:55.140* :  in increase in processed ingredients
*27:55.140- 27:56.900* :  after the Second World War.
*27:57.320- 27:58.120* :  Sometimes, though,
*27:58.340- 28:00.480* :  Barry has to suffer for his art.
*28:01.160- 28:02.180* :  Including trying mushrooms,
*28:02.180- 28:04.140* :  mixed with lobster and ketchup,
*28:04.960- 28:07.520* :  and a lot of different fish pastes.
*28:08.520- 28:10.160* :  Why am I going to say this looks like cat food,
*28:10.160- 28:11.180* :  but we have a cat now.
*28:11.780- 28:12.600* :  Cat food looks better.
*28:13.100- 28:15.140* :  He's credited the success of the account,
*28:15.140- 28:17.440* :  the universal appeal of the sandwich,
*28:17.980- 28:19.520* :  and the way the format crosses cultures,
*28:19.520- 28:21.440* :  lifestyles, and budgets.
*28:22.380- 28:24.520* :  While the concept is impossible to date,
*28:24.860- 28:25.900* :  the name sandwich, of course,
*28:26.120- 28:27.120* :  came from the UK,
*28:27.660- 28:28.920* :  and the fourth Earl of Sandwich
*28:29.060- 28:30.180* :  in the 18th century,
*28:30.220- 28:32.720* :  who deep beefed between bread 100.
*28:33.520- 28:35.460* :  So we asked a few people on the streets here
*28:35.460- 28:36.680* :  about their favourite.
*28:37.220- 28:38.840* :  A proper steak sandwich
*28:38.840- 28:40.700* :  with mustard and my own relish.
*28:41.220- 28:42.640* :  Chicken avocado mayonnaise.
*28:42.940- 28:45.480* :  My boss's sister made them when I was about 18
*28:45.520- 28:46.980* :  and they were the best sandwiches.
*28:47.360- 28:48.960* :  They're easy. They fill you up.
*28:49.380- 28:50.120* :  They taste great.
*28:50.540- 28:51.580* :  They're great for any occasion.
*28:51.580- 28:52.520* :  Anyone can make them.
*28:53.080- 28:54.060* :  Anyone can make them,
*28:54.060- 28:55.840* :  and Barry makes more than most.
*28:56.260- 28:56.820* :  So much so.
*28:56.820- 28:58.820* :  His next step is to go full circle
*28:58.820- 29:00.940* :  with a sandwich book of his own.
*29:01.960- 29:02.780* :  Stephanie Prentice,
*29:02.820- 29:05.000* :  ending there on a tasty note.
*29:07.320- 29:08.220* :  And that's it from us for now,
*29:08.240- 29:09.240* :  but there'll be a new edition
*29:09.240- 29:10.900* :  of the Global News Podcast later.
*29:11.320- 29:13.160* :  If you want to comment on this podcast
*29:13.160- 29:14.860* :  or the topics covered in it,
*29:15.160- 29:15.780* :  send us an email.
*29:15.780- 29:19.520* :  The address is globalpodcast.bbc.co.uk.
*29:20.060- 29:21.620* :  You can also find us on X,
*29:21.920- 29:23.240* :  formerly known as Twitter,
*29:23.640- 29:24.760* :  at Global NewsPod.
*29:25.340- 29:27.320* :  This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll,
*29:27.320- 29:28.940* :  the producer was Oliver Berla.
*29:29.340- 29:31.300* :  The editor, Zeva, is Karen Martin.
*29:31.920- 29:32.520* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson,
*29:32.520- 29:33.940* :  and until next time, bye-bye.
