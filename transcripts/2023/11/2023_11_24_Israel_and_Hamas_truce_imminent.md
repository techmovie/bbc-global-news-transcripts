*01:24.660- 01:27.800* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:29.880- 01:34.760* :  I'm Janet Gillil and in the early hours of Friday the 24th of November these are our main stories.
*01:35.380- 01:39.260* :  A temporary halt in the fighting between Israel and Hamas is due to begin shortly,
*01:39.580- 01:42.120* :  paving the way for a hostage and prisoner exchange.
*01:43.200- 01:47.820* :  War crimes prosecutors in the Hague have accused the detained former president of Kosovo
*01:47.820- 01:54.680* :  Hashim Fachi of tampering with witnesses. A woman has accused New York City's mayor Eric Adams
*01:54.680- 02:02.300* :  of sexual assault 30 years ago. Also in this podcast there's been another delay in the rescue
*02:02.300- 02:06.600* :  operation to free dozens of workers trapped in a tunnel in northern India.
*02:07.320- 02:12.360* :  I was speaking with one tunneling emergency expert here who was saying just how deeply
*02:12.360- 02:18.600* :  frustrating it is to get so close and there was this hope and expectation that the men
*02:18.600- 02:24.760* :  would be able to be rescued. And the plague of rats that's overrunning parts of the Australian
*02:24.760- 02:32.980* :  state of Queensland. As we record this podcast it looks as if some of the hostages who've been
*02:32.980- 02:39.240* :  held in Gaza will be released in a few hours time as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas
*02:39.520- 02:45.980* :  which will see fighting paused for four days. Palestinian prisoners will be freed from Israeli
*02:45.980- 02:51.600* :  prisons in exchange. Qatar which broke of the deal confirmed that a list of names of those
*02:51.600- 02:57.580* :  being swapped has been agreed. A foreign ministry spokesman in Doha, Majid Al Ansari
*02:57.580- 03:02.360* :  said an initial group of 13 hostages held by Hamas would be released.
*03:02.860- 03:10.100* :  The first patch of civilians to be released from Gaza will be around 4pm of the same day.
*03:10.640- 03:17.460* :  They will be 13 in number all women and children and those hostages who are from the same families
*03:17.460- 03:23.660* :  will be put together within the same patch. Obviously every day will include a number of
*03:23.660- 03:30.340* :  civilians as agreed to total 50 within the four days. So as he said 50 hostages should be
*03:30.340- 03:36.800* :  released over the next four days in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and teenagers.
*03:37.600- 03:43.140* :  The deal had initially been expected to take effect on Thursday morning but was delayed by a day
*03:43.140- 03:49.000* :  as details were hammered out. Adem Manit whose cousin is among the hostages being held by Hamas
*03:49.280- 03:55.980* :  welcomed the announcement by Qatar. Obviously really relieved that the children and some of the
*03:55.980- 04:01.640* :  women hostages will be hopefully released by tomorrow morning. We were hoping it would happen
*04:01.640- 04:06.560* :  this morning. You can imagine what it's like to be a parent of one of those children and waking
*04:06.560- 04:13.220* :  up this morning and still none of your children being home yet. Obviously we're continuing to hope
*04:13.260- 04:20.500* :  that those leads to more hostages being released and so he could come home because he has children too.
*04:21.400- 04:26.080* :  With swathes of Gaza reduced to rubble and many people struggling to get basic supplies,
*04:26.080- 04:32.980* :  this Gaza woman Ala Al-Sawat in the camps of Khan Yunus said she hoped to truce would mean more aid
*04:32.980- 04:41.500* :  coming in. We're struggling. Every day we say that our time to die is here today or tomorrow.
*04:41.800- 04:48.080* :  When they talk of a truce we get happy but it gets devastating when we hear of air strikes. We
*04:48.080- 04:53.340* :  want a truce for a lifetime. But for now the fighting is still raging in Gaza. The medical
*04:53.340- 04:58.220* :  director of the Indonesian Hospital in Northern Gaza has said conditions are desperate as Israel
*04:58.220- 05:03.740* :  continues its attacks nearby. And the director of another besieged hospital, Al-Shifa, has been
*05:03.740- 05:08.900* :  arrested by Israel along with several colleagues. Our Middle East regional editor, Mike Thompson,
*05:09.400- 05:15.440* :  told me that after many delays it did seem as if a first group of hostages would now finally
*05:15.440- 05:22.440* :  be freed. Hopes have been dashed before so it's still very precarious. There's this great lack
*05:22.440- 05:26.120* :  of trust and we've even had from the Israeli government a comment by one of the ministers
*05:26.120- 05:33.640* :  saying he didn't trust her mass. And also there are several groups in Gaza who are holding
*05:33.640- 05:39.060* :  hostages. It's not just her mass and any one of those could perhaps break this cease-fire so it's
*05:39.060- 05:45.040* :  very tenuous. And in the meantime fighting is continuing in Gaza and its particularly intense
*05:45.040- 05:50.140* :  around the Indonesian hospital in the north of the serratory. It is indeed yes,
*05:50.140- 05:54.920* :  they've been tanks firing for much of the day. In fact for several days now this has been going on
*05:55.420- 06:02.340* :  12 people killed on Monday in a shelling. So it's very difficult there and we've been
*06:02.340- 06:06.960* :  at the BBC he's been speaking to the medical director as you mentioned earlier on and he said
*06:07.460- 06:12.340* :  that the firing has been so intense that people are having to take shelter in the corridors.
*06:12.340- 06:17.700* :  They can't go in the rooms because the windows have been smashed by gunfire and the medical
*06:17.700- 06:22.920* :  director said even his own office has been targeted several times. And this is all being
*06:22.920- 06:27.560* :  attacked because he's railings like without a hospital. They suspect there are tunnels
*06:27.560- 06:32.460* :  underneath the hospital and that it's been used by a mass of military purposes. As you say all very
*06:32.460- 06:37.440* :  reminiscent of Al Shifa and Israel was saying that there was a Hamas command centre there.
*06:38.480- 06:43.320* :  They have now apparently arrested the director of Al Shifa and some of the medical staff there
*06:44.100- 06:47.940* :  has Israel been able to prove that this was a Hamas command centre.
*06:48.260- 06:53.380* :  In a word no. What they have found is weapons. They've found the tunnel system underneath.
*06:53.380- 06:58.940* :  They've found a very sturdy blast door there too at the entrance to the tunnels but it hasn't
*06:58.940- 07:04.020* :  been proven as a command centre. That's quite different to a few rooms and a tunnel and some
*07:04.020- 07:09.720* :  weapons. Mike Thompson. As the intensity of shelling along the border between Israel and Lebanon
*07:10.520- 07:15.660* :  increases tens of thousands of people and either side have left their homes. Israel has been accused
*07:15.660- 07:23.000* :  of quote unlawfully targeting fleeing Lebanese civilians including a family three children
*07:23.000- 07:28.640* :  and their grandmother who were killed by an airstrike earlier this month. Israel says it's investigating
*07:28.640- 07:34.240* :  the incident. The UN which patrols the blue line between Lebanon and Israel also says it hopes but
*07:34.240- 07:39.840* :  has no expectation that the pause in hostilities due to beginning Gaza will be replicated there.
*07:40.300- 07:42.420* :  From southern Lebanon we're a Davis reports.
*07:46.940- 07:53.320* :  So upon the Lebanese border with Israel with civil defence units all we know is that it has
*07:54.340- 07:59.980* :  been an airstrike on a house. A woman has apparently been killed.
*08:02.400- 08:08.260* :  Almost every day since the border conflict between Hezbollah and Israel began emergency services
*08:08.260- 08:14.320* :  have spared towards the aftermath of airstrikes and missile attacks. This one is in the village of
*08:14.320- 08:23.500* :  Kafarkella. 45 minutes ago there was a strike on a house here in which there was a family, a mother,
*08:23.500- 08:31.400* :  a father and several children. We know the mother has been killed, a father and children are in
*08:31.400- 08:39.500* :  hospital. All that's left is a completely burnt out house partially destroyed and there's a pretty
*08:39.500- 08:46.920* :  large pool of blood here on the steps. We later learned it was now the woman killed in the attack
*08:47.480- 08:53.600* :  and a young girl was seriously injured. In this village you can see the local civil defence chief
*08:53.620- 08:58.800* :  Anis Alba says civilians have increasingly become victims of this war.
*08:59.960- 09:07.080* :  For us the biggest concern is about the civilians. We have to save them every time,
*09:07.640- 09:13.880* :  but it's dangerous. Yes it's dangerous. Yes we know. But living in Lebanon is dangerous too.
*09:15.100- 09:21.100* :  As we spoke to the fire chief an Israeli drone cruised the skies above over Lebanese territory
*09:21.100- 09:27.060* :  where the powerful islamist Hezbollah organization is dominant and from where it fires rockets into
*09:27.060- 09:32.620* :  Israel. The drones are used by Israel to strike what it says are Hezbollah positions.
*09:32.780- 09:40.820* :  In Unifil there are 10,500 peacekeepers. It's the United Nations job to patrol the fragile blue line
*09:40.820- 09:49.000* :  between Israel and Lebanon. Spokesman Andrea Tinetti says that the conflict here has escalated
*09:49.000- 09:54.200* :  sporadically over the last seven weeks. Difficult to say because the shelling has been intense as
*09:54.200- 10:01.500* :  thousands of rockets and exchanges of fires on a regular basis. So when you have such an
*10:01.500- 10:07.800* :  intensity of the conflict in a very localized area where people are leaving of course the risk
*10:07.800- 10:16.840* :  of hitting and killing civilians is higher. The short family knew it was too dangerous to remain
*10:16.840- 10:22.340* :  in their home near the border. Shortly after leaving in a car for Beirut the mother,
*10:22.340- 10:29.380* :  grandmother and three children were hit by a strike from an Israeli drone. Their uncle Samir in
*10:29.380- 10:39.560* :  another car survived. Beirut is recognisable as a family car. Every bit of metal is twisted.
*10:40.600- 10:47.580* :  It's completely burnt out. The three little girls who sat in the back stood absolutely no chance.
*10:47.580- 10:54.040* :  The grandmother in the front was killed at Ryazah. Bag of olives just on the floor here beside
*10:54.040- 10:59.820* :  me, charred food that they'd bought for their journey just two minutes down the road.
*11:02.020- 11:07.680* :  The organization Human Rights Watch says what happened to the short family should be investigated
*11:07.680- 11:16.480* :  as an apparent war crime. Samir visits the charred wreckage every day and shows me the school
*11:16.480- 11:30.260* :  books that were in the car when it was hit. The uncle rejects Israel's explanation that it's
*11:30.260- 11:36.380* :  struck us as spacious vehicle containing terrorists. The Israeli army says it's investigating claims
*11:36.380- 11:42.500* :  that there may have been uninvolved civilians. The only person Samir was able to pull from the
*11:42.500- 11:49.460* :  wreckage alive was the girl's mother, Khoda Khijazi. I will always remember her screams in
*11:49.460- 11:56.040* :  the cries. She was telling me, get my kids out of the car. Get my kids out of the car.
*11:57.820- 12:06.920* :  She repeated this over and over until I dragged her out. 14-year-old Rimas Talid, who was 12 and
*12:06.920- 12:13.260* :  10-jord lian, only came back to the border for their school stuff. Schoolers, they will never finish
*12:13.880- 12:19.660* :  and more young lives lost in a war along one of the most volatile frontiers in the world.
*12:21.460- 12:28.180* :  That report by Wira Davis. A woman has accused New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, of sexual
*12:28.180- 12:34.520* :  assault in court papers filed on Wednesday. The allegations date back to 30 years ago. Mr. Adams
*12:34.520- 12:40.500* :  has denied the claims. This legal action is the latest in an avalanche of such lawsuits which
*12:40.500- 12:47.120* :  have been filed over the past year in New York State under the Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily
*12:47.120- 12:53.320* :  suspended the statute of limitations for civil claims brought by victims of historic sexual abuse.
*12:53.800- 12:57.040* :  Our North America correspondent, Shingha Yanyokha, tell us more.
*12:57.560- 13:04.200* :  Eric Adams is the current mayor of New York and before he became a politician, he was a police
*13:04.200- 13:10.880* :  officer rising to the ranks of Captain for about 20 years. It's during that time that the
*13:10.880- 13:17.480* :  plaintiff, an unidentified woman, says that while they were both employed for working for the
*13:17.480- 13:24.680* :  New York Police Department, that she was sexually assaulted. In her three-page legal filing,
*13:24.700- 13:31.060* :  she says that she was not just sexually assaulted, but she accuses him of sexual battery as well
*13:31.060- 13:37.020* :  as discrimination in the workplace and emotional distress. And she's not just suing Eric Adams.
*13:37.020- 13:42.040* :  She's also suing the city of New York and the police department and asking for five million
*13:42.040- 13:48.700* :  US dollars in relief. And this legal action is just the latest in a long series which have been
*13:48.700- 13:55.200* :  filed in the past year under a special temporary law. Yes, that's right. We understand that over
*13:55.200- 14:01.680* :  two and a half thousand cases have been filed by individuals as well as corporately. A lot of them
*14:01.680- 14:08.260* :  are targeted at the New York State Department, but what we've also seen is an increase in the number
*14:08.260- 14:13.560* :  of celebrities that have been named. So over the last week or so, we've already reported, for
*14:13.560- 14:20.580* :  example, on Sean Combs, who is a rapper who was accused of sexual assault spanning a 10-year
*14:20.580- 14:28.220* :  period by his ex-girlfriend. Over the last 24 hours, the guns and roses, lead singer Axel Rose,
*14:28.220- 14:35.900* :  was also named as well as Jamie Foxx. All of them so far have denied these allegations as has
*14:36.300- 14:41.760* :  Eric Adams, but interestingly, Sean Combs settled out of court with his ex-girlfriend, but
*14:41.760- 14:48.040* :  there is likely to be more and more lawsuits as this deadline expires end of day to day.
*14:48.320- 14:54.120* :  Because yeah, it is about to expire, so this would be the end for this act. So you are seeing
*14:54.120- 15:00.940* :  this last minute flurry of cases. Yes, absolutely. So after midnight Thursday, no one will
*15:01.400- 15:07.380* :  be able to sue a for sexual assault that took place a long time ago. And the rationale, the reason
*15:07.380- 15:11.920* :  why this law was put in place was they said that trauma takes time and there are a lot of victims
*15:11.920- 15:17.780* :  that suffered trauma that hadn't yet come forward. Initially, it was meant for children,
*15:17.780- 15:23.080* :  but then later extended to include adults. That's why we're seeing a lot of these cases over
*15:23.080- 15:29.280* :  the last year or so, where celebrities, as well as the New York State Department, have been named.
*15:30.380- 15:35.920* :  Shanghai and Yoko. The former president of Kosovo Hashim Fachi is in detention in the Hague.
*15:35.920- 15:41.360* :  He's accused of war crimes during the country's war of independence from Serbia in the 1990s,
*15:41.660- 15:47.600* :  when he was the leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Now, prosecutors have called for a ban on
*15:47.600- 15:53.960* :  his visits and those to two other former KLA commanders. They're also seeking to restrict phone calls
*15:53.960- 15:59.060* :  and mission communications and have called for the three to be segregated from other detainees.
*15:59.600- 16:05.160* :  I asked our Balkans correspondent, Guadalani, why? Well, it's as a response really to the worry that
*16:05.160- 16:10.680* :  they've always had at the court, which is that there was going to be extensive witness tampering.
*16:10.680- 16:16.660* :  And we've seen this before when there've been attempts at war crimes tribunals to try former
*16:16.660- 16:21.540* :  senior leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army. For example, at the International Criminal Tribunal
*16:21.540- 16:27.740* :  for the former Yugoslavia, and the former Prime Minister of Kosovo Ramil Shahadini was tried and
*16:27.740- 16:32.740* :  acquitted twice. And the reason there was a retrial in that case was exactly because of witness
*16:32.740- 16:38.320* :  tampering. Now, why do we get this issue with witness tampering? Well, look at who the KLA were.
*16:38.320- 16:44.120* :  For many Kosovo Albanians, their national heroes, they were the people who obtained Kosovo's
*16:44.120- 16:49.460* :  liberation from Serbia's Milosevic regime and led to the unilateral declaration of independence
*16:49.460- 16:56.020* :  in 2008. And Hashem Thachi is a really key figure in all of that. So there's lots of pressure
*16:56.580- 17:03.880* :  on people already for them not to testify against Hashem Thachi in this war crimes tribunal,
*17:03.880- 17:10.780* :  the new specialist chambers in the Hague. And you know, adding to that, if you've got witness
*17:10.780- 17:15.940* :  tampering, witness interference, witness intimidation, it's very, very difficult to have a credible
*17:15.940- 17:21.520* :  judicial process if you have these sort of things going on. That's why the prosecutors have made
*17:21.520- 17:26.720* :  this request. But what's the response been from Hashem Thachi's lawyers? Well, they've said they
*17:26.720- 17:32.380* :  need time to address the allegations. But in the meantime, the specialist chambers has actually
*17:32.380- 17:39.440* :  agreed temporarily to the prosecution's requests. They've ordered an interim set of restrictions
*17:39.440- 17:45.240* :  on the communications and visits that Hashem Thachi and two of his co-defendants can actually
*17:45.240- 17:51.220* :  enjoy. And they say these restrictions are appropriate given the risk of unlawful disclosure
*17:51.220- 17:56.940* :  of confidential information from the detention facilities. And the restrictions will remain temporary
*17:57.180- 18:02.520* :  until the panel issues a full decision in due course. So everybody's now going to be looking
*18:02.520- 18:08.300* :  at the accusations of the prosecution, including Mr Thachi's defense lawyers, and we'll hear later
*18:08.300- 18:12.700* :  on whether these restrictions will be imposed in a longer term. Guadaloni.
*18:15.540- 18:20.240* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast, we look at how the climate emergency is affecting
*18:20.240- 18:25.620* :  motherhood. I don't have that long sherry. I'm just feeling sad and hopeless all the time.
*18:25.620- 18:31.600* :  I would have to do everything in my power to make it better for the children.
*18:39.480- 18:44.520* :  This episode is brought to you by Progressive. Most of you aren't just listening right now.

*19:50.040- 19:55.400* :  Food is incredibly important in the world. It's about survival, culinary heritage, culture,
*19:55.400- 20:01.620* :  and tradition. Different relationships across the world. The food chain from the BBC World Service
*20:01.620- 20:07.780* :  examines the business, science, and cultural significance of food. If this kind of food is lost,
*20:07.780- 20:13.300* :  a community will lose its identity. And what it takes to put food on your plate.

*20:20.660- 20:22.400* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*20:23.260- 20:28.740* :  Here at Filders has been dubbed Europe's Donald Trump, partly because of his fiery attacks on
*20:28.740- 20:34.560* :  immigrants and Muslims, and partly because of his dyed blonde bouffant hairdo. And now, like Mr.
*20:34.560- 20:40.140* :  Trump, he's caused a political upset with his party unexpectedly coming first in elections
*20:40.140- 20:46.280* :  in the Netherlands. He insists he will be prime minister for everyone, as he prepares for coalition
*20:46.280- 20:51.220* :  talks to former government, even though the other main parties have said they won't serve under him
*20:51.220- 20:56.580* :  because of his far right policies. He wants a referendum to take the Netherlands out of the European
*20:56.580- 21:03.260* :  Union. Catcher Adler has been looking at what his victory means for Europe and its populist parties.
*21:04.220- 21:10.020* :  Khidrilders is well known for his anti-Muslim anti-immigration rhetoric. His unexpectedly
*21:10.020- 21:15.740* :  meaty election win saw hard-right politicians across Europe jostling to congratulate him.
*21:15.740- 21:21.480* :  They believe this is their moment. Marine Le Pen of France said Mr. Wilders' success,
*21:21.480- 21:26.500* :  with his pledge to return the Netherlands to the Dutch, was proof people in Europe were ready to
*21:26.500- 21:32.700* :  defend national identities. Hungary's Prime Minister Victor Orban, known like Mr. Wilders for
*21:32.700- 21:38.360* :  rousing anti-migrant and Eurosceptic speeches, concluded the winds of change were blowing
*21:38.360- 21:44.880* :  across the continent. But Khidrilders doesn't have enough seats to govern alone. Weeks of
*21:44.880- 21:50.600* :  political horse trading, otherwise known as coalition building, stretch ahead. He's admitted
*21:50.600- 21:56.400* :  he'll have to compromise. If he does become Prime Minister, things could get uncomfortable
*21:56.440- 22:00.820* :  in Brussels. Though today the European Commission insisted it wasn't worried.
*22:01.960- 22:07.820* :  Khidrilders is unlikely to fulfill his dream of taking the Netherlands out of the EU. He accepts
*22:07.820- 22:13.040* :  public opinion isn't behind him on that one. And he had to tone down his anti-Islam stance
*22:13.040- 22:19.260* :  to climb in pre-election opinion polls. But EU unity on Ukraine is looking less strong.
*22:19.680- 22:24.360* :  Mr. Wilders joins Hungary and Slovakia in opposing sending more military aid to Kiev.
*22:25.000- 22:31.000* :  And he hit the voter priority nail on the head, in homing in on migration, migration, migration,
*22:31.020- 22:36.400* :  and the cost of living crisis. And the mood in the Netherlands as across much of Europe
*22:36.820- 22:38.760* :  is becoming more hard-line.
*22:39.740- 22:45.420* :  Katja Adler. Violent protests have broken out in the Irish capital Dublin after a stabbing attack
*22:45.420- 22:50.920* :  outside of school left three children and a woman injured. The attack has not been identified,
*22:50.920- 22:56.340* :  but after anti-immigrant groups said he was a foreigner, crowds gathered near the scene
*22:56.340- 23:01.880* :  chanting slogans. They clashed with riot police, setting a police car on fire and damaging
*23:01.880- 23:08.760* :  other vehicles. The motive for the stabbing remains unclear. From Dublin, Sarah Gevin sent this report.
*23:10.180- 23:16.240* :  A smoke has been seen billowing over Dublin City Centre as a multiple stabbing turned into a
*23:16.240- 23:22.400* :  night of violence. Three young children were stabbed close to their school in Dublin earlier
*23:22.400- 23:27.140* :  this afternoon. Two of them and a woman remained in hospital being treated for their injuries.
*23:27.140- 23:33.320* :  I witnesses said bystanders wrestled a man to the ground and removed a knife from his hand.
*23:33.320- 23:38.000* :  That man who's in his 40s is being described by police as a person of interest.
*23:38.500- 23:42.620* :  Irish police, the Guardian, have said they're not looking for anyone else in relation to what
*23:42.620- 23:47.860* :  happened this afternoon and what happened then has led to hours of intense rioting.
*23:47.900- 23:54.560* :  We've seen a bus on fire, a car on fire, clashes between protesters and police and fireworks
*23:54.560- 23:59.880* :  thrown at them in front windows of shops smash too. When we heard earlier from the Guardian
*23:59.880- 24:04.800* :  Commissioner, Drew Harris, he said the people involved should go home, he said, and let police
*24:04.800- 24:10.000* :  do their job. He blamed the violence on what he described as a lunatic, hooligan faction
*24:10.060- 24:14.840* :  and he appealed to them not to listen to any speculation that we might have read on social media.
*24:16.940- 24:21.580* :  Researchers say that the climate emergency is making more women reconsider having children
*24:21.580- 24:26.160* :  in areas of the developing world. The study by the UK's University of Nottingham
*24:26.160- 24:31.260* :  spoke to people in 11 countries about how the threat of climate change might affect their decision
*24:31.260- 24:37.120* :  to start a family. As part of the BBC 100 women season, our environment correspondent,
*24:37.120- 24:43.380* :  Navin Singh Kadka, spoke to three women from across the global south who have serious concerns
*24:43.380- 24:53.140* :  about motherhood. It's May 2022. A team of Brazilian emergency workers and local residents
*24:53.660- 24:58.160* :  picked through the debris in a destroyed neighbourhood of the north-eastern coastal town of
*24:58.200- 25:03.360* :  Reseife. Heavy rains have caused flooding and landslides, killing 120 people.
*25:05.000- 25:09.300* :  Watching this disaster unfold, it was climate researcher Julia Burgess.
*25:11.660- 25:16.380* :  I started studying climate change more deeply and the climate issue became central in my life,
*25:16.760- 25:22.340* :  but I also led to an increase in my anxiety. I started to imagine catastrophic outlooks
*25:22.580- 25:31.160* :  of actual global destruction. But it wasn't just a career or mental health that were affected,
*25:31.800- 25:40.000* :  but a confidence in starting a family. I cannot see myself as being responsible for the life
*25:40.000- 25:46.120* :  of an over-human being or for generating a new life that would become an extra burden to a
*25:46.120- 25:53.600* :  planet that is so overloaded already. Julia is not alone. Nottingham University researchers
*25:53.600- 26:00.320* :  focused on adults in 11 countries and asked whether anxiety about climate change had made them
*26:00.320- 26:06.960* :  think they should not have children or made them regret having them. In Brazil, more than half
*26:06.960- 26:12.740* :  of respondents said yes. In India, it was almost three out of four.
*26:17.640- 26:24.020* :  Srishti Singh's flester, from Nepal, also felt that way after she gave birth to her daughter.
*26:24.900- 26:29.260* :  Once I had her, then I had the sudden pan of guilt every morning and I looked at her face,
*26:29.860- 26:36.040* :  understanding how climate change is actually changing lives for the worst, for the planet,
*26:36.040- 26:41.780* :  for the animals and for our children. But this realization is a cryover day and that was when I
*26:41.780- 26:52.660* :  decided I was pretty sure that I'm not going to have another child again. According to UNICEF,
*26:53.040- 26:58.420* :  Nigeria is the second most vulnerable country worldwide in terms of children's exposure
*26:58.420- 27:07.720* :  to climate change. Last year alone, historic flooding put nearly 1.5 million children in the
*27:07.720- 27:15.480* :  country at risk of disease, malnutrition and drowning. Nigerian Ayurvede Olude runs the
*27:15.480- 27:22.040* :  Ecoanxiety Africa project, which offers support to those whose mental health is being impacted
*27:22.220- 27:27.220* :  by climate risks. While there wants to have children or want a big hit in the
*27:27.220- 27:32.060* :  world, in a place where I might want to be able to protect a child,
*27:32.600- 27:38.240* :  Imitis says she has to stand up to both societal and family pressures.
*27:39.020- 27:42.600* :  In a society where women barely have the power to decide,
*27:43.340- 27:46.900* :  and where they are really just believes that one should have kids. It picks
*27:46.900- 27:51.480* :  considerable strains and determination to say this in public.
*27:51.940- 27:54.080* :  In the face of increasing climate distress,
*27:54.080- 28:02.540* :  Srishti is looking for ways to cope. I don't have the luxury of just feeling sad and bad and feeling
*28:03.200- 28:09.180* :  hopeless all the time. I would have to do everything basically in my power to bring change,
*28:09.180- 28:14.400* :  whatever I can, whatever small it is to make it better for the children.
*28:15.440- 28:20.580* :  Srishti Singh Shrestha from Nepal, ending that report from Navin Singh Kadka.
*28:21.640- 28:26.340* :  The operation to rescue 41 construction workers who have been trapped for days in a collapsed
*28:26.340- 28:32.280* :  tunnel in northern India has once again had to be put on hold. It was paused after a new drilling
*28:32.280- 28:37.980* :  machine which had been making good progress hit further debris just meters from the trapped men.
*28:38.820- 28:43.500* :  Arnold Dix is from the International Tunneling Association which is helping with the rescue
*28:44.280- 28:49.320* :  operations. At the moment it's like we're there, we're knocking, we know the guys are on the other
*28:49.320- 28:54.740* :  side what we can't get in. Our correspondent Samira Hussein is at the tunnel entrance. She told us
*28:54.740- 29:02.440* :  more about this latest delay. Rescue efforts have now been put on pause because they have run into
*29:02.440- 29:09.000* :  yet another snag. So to give you a sense of just what they're contending with, remember this accident
*29:09.000- 29:15.060* :  happened because of a landslide and it crushed a partially built tunnel. And so there were people
*29:15.060- 29:19.980* :  working inside but there was also a lot of machinery inside the tunnel when it collapsed.
*29:20.640- 29:26.740* :  And so they have a drilling machine that they are using to drill through these several meters
*29:26.740- 29:33.040* :  of debris and every so often they're met with pieces of metal. Well that's exactly what happened
*29:33.920- 29:40.240* :  and that piece of metal ended up breaking the drilling machine and now the rescue operations have
*29:40.240- 29:44.340* :  been put on hold yet again and they don't expect to be up and running again until tomorrow.
*29:44.340- 29:52.620* :  That is just so frustrating. How close are they to the men? They say they're within 12 to 18 meters.
*29:52.620- 29:58.220* :  It's all an estimate. They estimate that it's the the manner about 57 to 60 meters
*29:59.240- 30:06.880* :  behind this wall of debris. So they are inching closer and closer and in fact I was speaking with one
*30:07.720- 30:13.880* :  tunneling emergency expert here who was saying just how deeply frustrating it is to get so close
*30:13.980- 30:20.940* :  and there was this hope and expectation that the men would be able to be rescued by yesterday
*30:20.940- 30:27.020* :  or even today but that has now changed of course. What next? What's the plan? The plan is they're
*30:27.020- 30:32.840* :  going to continue as they've done in the past when they've had difficulties with their machinery.
*30:32.840- 30:37.160* :  They're going to wait for replacement parts. They're going to get it fixed and then they're going
*30:37.160- 30:43.360* :  to continue on with their rescue efforts. It's important to note though just how complicated it is
*30:43.360- 30:50.200* :  to actually get new pieces of machinery into this area. I mean we're talking about really narrow
*30:50.300- 30:56.080* :  roads going windy roads going up a mountain to give you a sense of just how complicated it can be.
*30:56.080- 31:02.360* :  It took me 11 and a half hours to get here from the capital of New Delhi so it's hard to get this
*31:02.360- 31:09.320* :  kind of sophisticated equipment into this area. Samira Hussein in Uttarakhand state in northern India.
*31:10.280- 31:15.740* :  Parts of the state of Queensland in Australia have been overrun with a plague of rats.
*31:16.380- 31:21.900* :  As Mickey Brista reports a wet winter and a good harvest have created the ideal breeding
*31:21.900- 31:27.840* :  conditions for them. The rats are everywhere and in massive numbers there were so many that they've
*31:27.840- 31:33.820* :  been forced to migrate across Queensland in search of food. Hards of them have even turned up some
*31:33.820- 31:40.340* :  dead some alive on the beaches of coastal towns. The rats we produce quickly in an explosion in
*31:40.340- 31:46.140* :  their numbers often follows periods of prolonged rainfall in Australia but experts say the rodents
*31:46.140- 31:52.060* :  might soon run out of food and the population should then crash. Mickey Brista.
*31:54.700- 31:59.200* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new addition of the Global News Podcast later
*31:59.540- 32:04.260* :  and as the next UN summit on climate change approaches we're also making a special
*32:04.260- 32:09.900* :  addition of the Global News Podcast looking where the world has got to in its efforts to tackle
*32:09.900- 32:14.740* :  the problem. So we want your questions which we'll be putting to two of our science and climate
*32:15.880- 32:19.940* :  experts. What would you like to know about the changing climate or about how these summits work?
*32:20.580- 32:25.280* :  Do you think our leaders are responding in the right way and what would you ask them if you were
*32:25.280- 32:30.480* :  there? If you can please send us a recording of your question along with your name and where you're
