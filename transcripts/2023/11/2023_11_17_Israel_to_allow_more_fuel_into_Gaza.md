*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:18.760* :  by advertising. Wait, so you said you genetically engineered yourself? I put a foreign piece of DNA
*00:18.760- 00:25.200* :  inside myself. Wow! Crowd science is the podcast that takes your questions about life and the
*00:25.200- 00:30.240* :  world around us and goes in search of the answers. What happens to bugs during the winter?
*00:30.240- 00:34.900* :  Oh, there's a lot's been there, yeah. Just search for Crowd Science, wherever you found this podcast.
*00:35.500- 00:38.760* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:40.860- 00:46.220* :  I'm Nick Karaci and at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 17th of November these are our main stories.
*00:46.220- 00:52.820* :  Israel says it will let two fuel trucks a day into Gaza where shortages have stopped aid distribution.
*00:53.280- 00:59.320* :  Turkey's president makes a controversial state visit to Germany. A cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe
*00:59.320- 01:08.140* :  triggers a state of emergency. Also in this podcast a top AI boss in Britain quits over using
*01:08.140- 01:14.040* :  copyrighted material without consent. The ability's response was we believe that training
*01:14.060- 01:20.540* :  generative AI models on copyrighted works is a fair use of those copyrighted works and that's
*01:27.940- 01:31.100* :  something that I really disagree with. As the Israeli military operation continues in Gaza as
*01:31.100- 01:36.220* :  retaliation for the Hamas attacks on October the 7th aid agencies are saying the situation is
*01:36.220- 01:41.740* :  intolerable for the civilian population. Fuel shortages have halted delivery supplies and shut
*01:41.740- 01:46.820* :  down telecommunications. Now the Israeli war cabinets has approved letting two fuel
*01:46.820- 01:51.700* :  lorries a day into the strip. An Israeli official said the fuel was to help meet the needs
*01:51.700- 01:59.440* :  of UN agencies in Gaza. Juliet Tumor is a spokesperson for UN Relief Agency for Palestinians
*01:59.440- 02:05.980* :  and described the situation. There is a communications blackout as of last night in Gaza
*02:06.840- 02:13.020* :  and there is lack of fuel so the combination makes it impossible for us to pick up those trucks
*02:13.020- 02:18.040* :  and then when we pick up those trucks we have to distribute them to people and so this
*02:18.040- 02:24.300* :  combination of challenges is making it impossible. I got more from our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*02:24.300- 02:30.000* :  Yaland now. We've seen a key announcement actually within the past hour or so. We just heard
*02:30.000- 02:34.420* :  from an Israeli official that the Israeli war cabinet has now approved two lorries loads of fuel
*02:34.840- 02:41.940* :  to enter each day for the use by the UN. There are indications it's at the request of Washington.
*02:42.580- 02:47.160* :  We're being told that that fuel will give minimal support for pumping water, for sewage and
*02:47.160- 02:52.860* :  sanitation systems. Of course there have been real fears about outbreaks of disease with some
*02:52.860- 02:58.880* :  sewage coming up on the streets of Raffa in the past few days. That's in the south of Gaza
*02:59.420- 03:04.880* :  after a couple of days of torrential rain. It will also allow aid deliveries to resume.
*03:05.120- 03:09.520* :  There had been real concern about what would happen because we've had medical supplies and
*03:09.520- 03:13.180* :  water and food cut off and the world food program had been saying there was an imminent
*03:13.180- 03:18.040* :  possibility of starvation due to the lack of food supplies. What's happening at the
*03:18.040- 03:24.020* :  Shifa hospital that the scene of intense activity? Well because of the telecommunications blackout
*03:24.020- 03:30.720* :  that there's been with this fuel shortage it means that we've not really been able to contact
*03:30.720- 03:36.860* :  the doctors there as we had in previous days. We understand that the Israeli forces are continuing
*03:36.860- 03:42.440* :  to operate there. We had that video that was circulated earlier we're not able to independently
*03:42.440- 03:49.960* :  verify it but it appears to show a tunnel shaft at the hospital. There were also some new halls
*03:49.960- 03:54.700* :  of weapons showed off by a soldier but this falls far short of the very sophisticated
*03:54.700- 04:00.040* :  Hamas Command and Control Centre using a vast underground tunnel network that the Israeli
*04:00.040- 04:05.640* :  military had previously said it thought was there. It's searching of course goes on. There have
*04:05.640- 04:13.600* :  also been updates about hostages with the bodies of two women hostages taken from Israel found
*04:13.600- 04:19.480* :  in buildings close to a Shifa hospital. So in the heart of Gaza City the funeral took place
*04:19.480- 04:24.680* :  just a short time ago of a young woman soldier who is one of them corporal Nua Marasiano.
*04:25.760- 04:32.020* :  Yeland Nell in Jerusalem. Oforan correspondents are unable to go independently into Gaza to witness
*04:32.020- 04:37.280* :  the effects of Israel's offensive there but the BBC's Yogi Tlamayi has worked with local freelance
*04:37.280- 04:41.660* :  journalist Majdi Fati who's in the territory to compile this report.
*04:46.600- 04:51.120* :  Multiple times this week ambulances have pulled into the Al-Aqsa hospital
*04:51.700- 04:57.580* :  carrying the injured from airstrikes on Daryl Bala in central Gaza and surrounding areas.
*05:00.180- 05:07.060* :  Hundreds are estimated to have been killed this week among them members of the Bogud family.
*05:09.740- 05:16.560* :  Bloodied crying some unresponsive they were brought into the hospital. One of the older men
*05:16.560- 05:22.400* :  from the family with injuries on his hand and blood on his forehead is treated on the floor.
*05:26.740- 05:30.960* :  We're being killed and no one is doing anything about it he shouts.
*05:32.300- 05:39.000* :  Abid Burguth a young boy wearing a red t-shirt and trousers is taken in on a stretcher.
*05:41.380- 05:46.540* :  He's still breathing but is in critical condition. He's lost a lot of blood.
*05:48.200- 05:55.820* :  Doctors scrambled to treat him. On the floor by his side his father Supe is lying.
*05:56.920- 06:03.180* :  A nurse uses a stethoscope to try to listen for a heartbeat. Others try to feel for a pulse.
*06:03.920- 06:10.920* :  They can't find it. Outside members of their family collapse on the floor,
*06:11.500- 06:17.780* :  still finding out who's been rescued, who survived and who hasn't from 30 members.
*06:19.360- 06:23.460* :  The youngest, a baby, is injured but not seriously.
*06:24.600- 06:29.000* :  The Burguths had fled to Daryl Bala for safety from Zewm in the north.
*06:31.220- 06:35.800* :  A bit later Supe's brother Ali is taken to identify the bodies.
*06:39.220- 06:44.060* :  We thought we'd come to a safe place but no one is safe in Gaza. Ali says.
*06:44.060- 06:45.100* :  Yes, I'm in Gaza.
*06:47.540- 06:51.960* :  Aas later, hurried funeral prayers are held in the compound of the hospital.
*06:53.200- 06:56.120* :  Four bodies covered in white sheets lie on the ground.
*06:57.280- 07:04.200* :  Abid, Supe, Bilal and Al-Abrahguth, four of thousands of garsens killed.
*07:05.800- 07:09.800* :  Before they take the bodies away, Supe's mother kneels over him.
*07:12.800- 07:14.320* :  Goodbye, my dear, she weeps.
*07:14.980- 07:17.700* :  You're with God now. You were such a good son.
*07:19.900- 07:22.380* :  Grief is one form of suffering in Gaza.
*07:23.380- 07:27.500* :  Those who've escaped the bombs are struggling to find water and food.
*07:33.960- 07:38.840* :  Palestine Heckmouth has been standing for hours outside one of the few flammels
*07:39.060- 07:40.100* :  still running in Gaza.
*07:45.500- 07:50.780* :  We've escaped death but now we are dying slowly because of the severe shortage of food, flower and
*07:50.780- 07:56.780* :  basic needs. We are a family of eight. I burned discarded paper cups to keep my children warm.
*07:57.100- 07:59.920* :  Hundreds are outside the closed gates of the mill.
*08:00.860- 08:04.100* :  From inside the gates, the manager tries to pacify people.
*08:04.280- 08:06.580* :  I can't, I can't eat until I'm in the room.
*08:06.580- 08:10.400* :  Someone in the crowd shouts, we've been hungry for two days.
*08:12.300- 08:15.120* :  As if Al-Azim wants the world to help them.
*08:19.620- 08:22.700* :  There is no food, no resources here, and I'm not alone.
*08:23.200- 08:26.460* :  We are trapped here in these conditions. Where do we turn to?
*08:27.580- 08:32.840* :  At the moment, no eight trucks are getting in for Gaza's 2.2 million people.
*08:33.780- 08:36.960* :  And there's no way out for all but a tiny handful.
*08:40.760- 08:45.580* :  As we record this podcast, Turkey's President Erdogan is on a state visit to Germany,
*08:45.580- 08:48.280* :  in which he'll have talks with Chancellor Olaf Schultz.
*08:48.500- 08:53.440* :  Some German opposition parties had called for the trip to be cancelled because of Mr Erdogan's
*08:53.440- 08:58.560* :  stance on the conflict in Gaza. So what exactly is that position? A question for our
*08:58.560- 09:03.700* :  correspondent in Berlin, Damien Migenis. It's a very controversial one and it's something that
*09:03.700- 09:06.920* :  if you said these things in Germany, you could be liable to prosecution.
*09:07.480- 09:12.920* :  Namely, President Erdogan has hinted at undermining the legitimacy of Israel as a state.
*09:12.920- 09:18.100* :  He has refused to condemn the atrocities of Hamas and called the group liberators,
*09:18.680- 09:22.460* :  as opposed to the definition in most Western European states.
*09:22.460- 09:26.660* :  That is that Hamas is a terror organisation according to the German government.
*09:26.700- 09:32.840* :  And he has effectively said things that some people here would define as antisemitic.
*09:33.200- 09:36.960* :  So this is why it's very difficult because with the conflict in the Middle East, you have
*09:36.960- 09:42.180* :  Germany on one side because of its history and because of responsibility for the Holocaust,
*09:42.820- 09:46.900* :  views supporting Israel's security as non-negotiable and on the other side,
*09:47.400- 09:52.140* :  you have President Erdogan who increasingly over the last few weeks has seen to
*09:52.140- 09:57.600* :  been trying to undermine Israel's position. Having said that, Germany and Turkey have very
*09:57.600- 10:02.060* :  important relations when it comes to the diaspora, the Turkish diaspora in Germany.
*10:02.660- 10:06.120* :  Three million people have Turkish heritage. Half of them can vote in Turkey.
*10:06.120- 10:11.740* :  You have deep trade links and I think the real hope in Berlin is that all of Schultz can
*10:12.180- 10:17.960* :  exert some influence on President Erdogan to potentially have a moderating effect on Hamas
*10:18.140- 10:23.700* :  and possibly act as a mediator. I think he's not someone who can talk to Israel now directly
*10:24.260- 10:27.700* :  because of his comments, but possibly he could have contacts to Hamas.
*10:27.780- 10:32.080* :  And I think that's the real hope of these behind-the-scenes meetings today in Berlin.
*10:32.980- 10:36.280* :  Damian McGinnis An executive at one of Britain's biggest
*10:36.280- 10:41.300* :  artificial intelligence companies has quit over its willingness to use copyrighted material
*10:41.300- 10:46.400* :  without consent. Ed Newton Rex was head of audio at Stability AI.
*10:46.880- 10:50.100* :  Our technology correspondent Zoe Kleinman has been speaking to him.
*10:50.660- 10:54.500* :  Ed Newton Rex is a technologist and also a choral composer.
*10:54.940- 10:58.000* :  And what he's done is actually a really brave thing. He's resigned because
*10:58.000- 11:02.140* :  he disagrees with a view that's taken not only by his now former employer,
*11:02.520- 11:07.660* :  but also most big AI firms. And that view is that copyright material is basically fair game
*11:07.660- 11:12.280* :  for these companies that they can take it often from the net without asking permission
*11:12.680- 11:17.240* :  and they can use it to train AI products which can then generate content which either
*11:17.240- 11:22.840* :  competes with that work or replaces it altogether. Now these companies say that they should be exempt
*11:22.940- 11:26.880* :  from copyright law because what they're doing improves creative development.
*11:27.440- 11:29.900* :  But Ed Newton Rex told me he doesn't think it's right.
*11:30.540- 11:34.240* :  When you train generative AI models you have to train it on some kind of training data.
*11:34.840- 11:39.160* :  And I've always been very passionate about when you're training those models working with the
*11:39.160- 11:44.360* :  people who own that data to make sure that they're consenting to you using it in that way.
*11:44.360- 11:50.820* :  I think that's really important to do. The US copyright office put out this request for comment
*11:50.860- 11:54.600* :  on what people like anyone thinks about generative AI and copyright.
*11:55.060- 12:00.040* :  Divilities response like many other non generative AI companies was we believe that training
*12:01.120- 12:07.660* :  generative AI models on copyrighted works is a fair use of that of those copyrighted works.
*12:07.660- 12:12.020* :  And so it can be done essentially what I mean is it can be done without consent permission payment
*12:12.020- 12:16.140* :  anything you can just kind of do it. And that's something that I really disagree with.
*12:16.560- 12:21.520* :  We've already seen legal actions taken by some well-known creators including the US
*12:21.520- 12:27.580* :  comedian Sarah Silverman and George R.R. Martin the creative game Thrones against AIO fans for
*12:27.580- 12:32.060* :  doing exactly this. Because basically what's happening here Nick is that these AI tools are learning
*12:32.060- 12:36.920* :  from other people's work and then recreating it either for free or they're owning the company behind
*12:36.920- 12:41.260* :  them some money. There are some firms who are licensing this material and they are trying to work
*12:41.580- 12:45.800* :  to pay people for their copyright working and that's really what Ed Newton Rex is saying that
*12:45.800- 12:49.240* :  they should be better solutions to this and companies just helping themselves.
*12:50.460- 12:51.940* :  The BBC is Zoe Kleinman.
*12:54.820- 13:00.200* :  Still to come on this podcast. They see how we see it east to buy other products on Amazon
*13:00.900- 13:06.280* :  and they want that convenience when buying a car and together we're going to give it to them.
*13:06.860- 13:12.540* :  We're going to need a bigger box Amazon plan to offer human day cars.
*13:16.280- 13:21.280* :  How do we navigate in space? Are humans naturally clean and tidy?
*13:21.540- 13:25.420* :  What exactly is this quantum computer? Can smell enhanced your appetite?
*13:25.620- 13:30.520* :  Crowd science is the podcast that takes your science questions and goes in search of the answers.
*13:30.520- 13:34.460* :  My question for crowd science is are artistic brains different?
*13:34.700- 13:38.100* :  Stick with me because there's been some really fascinating research into this.
*13:38.200- 13:40.460* :  That's crowd science from the BBC World Service.
*13:40.640- 13:41.840* :  I love this question.
*13:42.100- 13:44.740* :  Just search for crowd science wherever you found this podcast.
*13:49.140- 13:53.600* :  Dissimbar Boy where more than 100 people have died of cholera in the capital Harari.
*13:53.940- 13:58.280* :  Thousands more are thought to have the disease. The authorities have declared a state of emergency
*13:58.880- 14:00.960* :  and are asking for help to contain the spread.
*14:01.320- 14:04.900* :  I asked the BBC's Dorcas Juan Guerra who's monitoring events from Nairobi
*14:04.900- 14:06.480* :  to tell us more about the outbreak.
*14:06.940- 14:10.020* :  Cholera is a disease that's spread by contaminated water
*14:10.660- 14:14.140* :  and simply put it's just the lack of access to clean water
*14:14.720- 14:17.000* :  and also having problems with sewage treatment.
*14:17.620- 14:22.780* :  On November 15th, today's ago, one of the health minister said that the shallow wells
*14:22.780- 14:27.080* :  in one of the areas that is most affected is also leading to an increase in cases.
*14:27.400- 14:29.280* :  What help do the authorities need?
*14:29.280- 14:33.880* :  Clear cause for concern, obviously, if this state of emergency has been declared?
*14:34.300- 14:39.300* :  Well, there's a lot that is needed in terms of aid, more health workers,
*14:39.300- 14:42.960* :  because you have more than 7,000 people suspected to have cholera
*14:43.500- 14:47.380* :  and also in terms of water, that's the most important issue
*14:47.380- 14:52.220* :  having clean water tracked to people so that it is safe to avoid more cases.
*14:52.880- 14:57.740* :  No stranger is it to sew cholera, Zimbabwe?
*14:57.740- 15:01.980* :  I seem to recall a huge outbreak in 2008.
*15:01.980- 15:04.000* :  So really, they can't be stopped, can they?
*15:04.200- 15:08.780* :  Yes, and in 2008, 4,000 people died of this disease.
*15:08.780- 15:12.000* :  More than 100,000 people were affected.
*15:12.000- 15:16.320* :  And it really brought a lot of attention, particularly from the political class.
*15:16.900- 15:19.580* :  A few days ago, W chose emergency's director,
*15:19.580- 15:22.980* :  Mike Ryan, called cholera a post-tachial of poverty,
*15:23.760- 15:26.040* :  social injustice, climate change and conflict.
*15:26.600- 15:29.660* :  So it's not just about the disease, dealing with the disease,
*15:29.660- 15:33.000* :  but also the other factors that compound and increase its spread.
*15:33.800- 15:36.960* :  And very briefly, the authorities confident they'll get to grips with this?
*15:37.400- 15:40.780* :  Well, this outbreak has been going on since February,
*15:40.780- 15:42.800* :  so this has been months in the making.
*15:43.460- 15:47.060* :  And now with impacts of El Nino, with rain and flooding,
*15:47.060- 15:48.600* :  it could make the situation worse.
*15:48.660- 15:52.480* :  Without aid, I'm afraid it may not be stopped as soon as possible.
*15:53.360- 15:54.660* :  Docus one gira.
*15:55.820- 16:00.500* :  Nearly 20,000 men have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the war last year
*16:01.040- 16:03.200* :  to avoid being drafted into the military.
*16:03.420- 16:05.880* :  A further 21,000 have tried to leave,
*16:06.240- 16:08.200* :  but were caught by the Ukrainian authorities,
*16:08.660- 16:10.020* :  according to a BBC investigation.
*16:10.020- 16:13.900* :  Since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022,
*16:14.660- 16:17.960* :  Ukraine has banned men of fighting age from leaving the country
*16:18.340- 16:20.000* :  unless they have a valid exemption.
*16:20.260- 16:24.000* :  Katya Khinkulava reports on how some are managing to escape
*16:24.460- 16:26.120* :  with the help of corrupt officials.
*16:32.580- 16:34.280* :  It is the early hours of the morning,
*16:34.720- 16:37.240* :  and we're out on patrol in northern Moldova,
*16:37.440- 16:40.660* :  with Dino, a senior officer from the border police.
*16:45.320- 16:48.440* :  It's a high-risk border sector for both Moldova and Ukraine,
*16:49.080- 16:51.320* :  because we haven't been able to secure it all
*16:51.620- 16:53.900* :  to stop illegal crossings of Ukrainians.
*16:56.900- 17:01.740* :  Ukraine's border with Moldova has become the most popular illegal way out.
*17:02.800- 17:07.480* :  Since the start of the war, over 11,000 men have used this route.
*17:08.060- 17:10.680* :  In a refugee sentencing nearby, we meet Eric.
*17:11.620- 17:13.440* :  He's a 26-year-old musician,
*17:13.440- 17:16.440* :  and has just arrived on foot from Ukraine.
*17:21.800- 17:24.560* :  It is illegal for men under 60 to leave Ukraine
*17:24.560- 17:27.440* :  without a valid exemption from military service.
*17:28.540- 17:31.580* :  Those caught trying face up to 80 years in jail.
*17:32.820- 17:34.600* :  But if men like Eric make it out,
*17:34.600- 17:38.120* :  they have the right to claim asylum in neighboring countries.
*17:38.860- 17:41.240* :  Eric says he has a serious health condition
*17:41.240- 17:43.660* :  that prohibits him from joining the army.
*17:44.460- 17:47.080* :  He claims he couldn't get a medical exemption,
*17:47.600- 17:49.520* :  commonly known as a white ticket.
*17:50.040- 17:53.680* :  We heard rumors that some men are paying substantial bribes
*17:53.960- 17:55.380* :  to obtain a white ticket.
*17:56.160- 17:59.080* :  To find out more, we asked a local journalist
*17:59.460- 18:01.780* :  to pretend to be a man who wants to leave Ukraine.
*18:08.220- 18:10.340* :  As soon as possible, they want to see
*18:10.340- 18:11.740* :  and visit my family in Germany.
*18:13.000- 18:16.500* :  A quick search reveals at least six groups offering help
*18:16.500- 18:18.480* :  on the messaging app Telegram.
*18:18.980- 18:21.280* :  He contacts the person running one of the groups
*18:21.280- 18:23.560* :  and is soon offered a white ticket.
*18:24.260- 18:28.060* :  The man claims the ticket is issued by territorial recruitment centers.
*18:29.180- 18:32.240* :  Officials at these centers work closely with military doctors
*18:32.740- 18:35.580* :  to decide who can get a medical exemption.
*18:36.720- 18:39.440* :  They send me an example of this white ticket.
*18:39.860- 18:41.500* :  It's for me this document looks real.
*18:43.080- 18:44.860* :  Probably they know somebody at that office.
*18:45.160- 18:46.580* :  So this is corruption.
*18:47.660- 18:49.700* :  Using freedom of information requests,
*18:50.220- 18:53.400* :  BBCI established that since the start of the war,
*18:53.740- 18:56.540* :  nearly 7,000 men have been arrested
*18:57.020- 18:59.160* :  for using fraudulent paperwork to leave,
*18:59.840- 19:01.260* :  including white tickets.
*19:01.540- 19:05.940* :  We put our findings to a senior politician
*19:05.940- 19:08.620* :  from the ruling party, Fedir Vinislavski.
*19:11.340- 19:15.300* :  We are doing our best to reduce the number of corruption cases.
*19:16.480- 19:18.640* :  Those who try to avoid mobilization
*19:19.120- 19:21.000* :  are about one to five percent.
*19:21.780- 19:25.120* :  They are definitely not critical to the defence of Ukraine.
*19:28.260- 19:29.380* :  I am in the U.S. now.
*19:29.860- 19:30.800* :  Eric eventually made it to the U.S.
*19:33.880- 19:34.640* :  where he was reunited with his wife and daughter.
*19:37.540- 19:41.880* :  I served my country enough not to feel any guilt for living with my family.
*19:43.020- 19:43.480* :  We all miss Ukraine.
*19:45.220- 19:47.940* :  If men will be able to return without consequences,
*19:47.940- 19:50.180* :  then yes, I shall consider returning one day.
*19:55.380- 19:57.940* :  No report from Katya Hilukova.
*19:59.080- 20:01.740* :  Now, we buy everything online these days,
*20:01.740- 20:03.800* :  but what about a car?
*20:04.440- 20:07.480* :  They see how we see this to buy other products on Amazon,
*20:08.180- 20:10.560* :  and they want that convenience when buying a car.
*20:11.460- 20:13.560* :  And together, we're going to give it to them.
*20:14.460- 20:17.100* :  The final piece of news that we're announcing today is this.
*20:17.180- 20:20.940* :  Next year, customers will be able to buy new vehicles
*20:21.640- 20:22.740* :  directly on Amazon.
*20:27.260- 20:31.760* :  Jose Munoz, a global chief operating officer for Huende,
*20:31.760- 20:35.080* :  a multi-money from Amazon at the Los Angeles Motor Show.
*20:35.660- 20:38.860* :  Huende, the South Korean car giant, will be the first brand
*20:38.860- 20:41.200* :  sold on Amazon's U.S. site.
*20:41.200- 20:43.240* :  But what does this mean for car buying?
*20:43.620- 20:45.480* :  Roger Hearing has been speaking to our U.S.
*20:45.620- 20:47.220* :  business correspondent, Erin Delmore.
*20:47.800- 20:53.120* :  This is a big next step for Hyundai and its digital showroom on Amazon.com.
*20:53.120- 20:56.400* :  Because you can go on to Amazon, you can go on to Hyundai's page,
*20:56.800- 20:58.280* :  and you can look at the offerings.
*20:58.280- 21:03.140* :  You can browse the models, you can even go so far as to customize your car.
*21:03.560- 21:05.820* :  And then when you go to purchase, it'll give you a total,
*21:05.820- 21:07.600* :  and it will show you dealerships nearby.
*21:07.600- 21:11.540* :  And right now, you will see information on how to contact the dealership,
*21:11.540- 21:13.420* :  or you can follow a link to the web page.
*21:13.780- 21:15.460* :  But come next year, that part changes,
*21:15.620- 21:16.780* :  because you can make the purchase,
*21:17.240- 21:18.720* :  and you can follow through on Amazon.
*21:18.920- 21:20.180* :  Now, you're still linked with a dealer.
*21:20.300- 21:22.780* :  It's dealership that will deliver you the car,
*21:22.780- 21:24.200* :  that you'll go to to pick it up.
*21:24.520- 21:26.400* :  But now the transaction gets done through Amazon,
*21:26.400- 21:27.860* :  and that's a big change.
*21:28.200- 21:29.320* :  It's a first for Amazon.
*21:29.320- 21:31.080* :  Hyundai is the leader in the pack here,
*21:31.080- 21:34.020* :  and this is the major change to Hyundai's digital store.
*21:34.340- 21:35.600* :  So why have they done it, do you think?
*21:35.900- 21:38.640* :  Well, think about what we've been through in the last few years with the pandemic,
*21:38.640- 21:41.940* :  when so many people who wanted a car were stuck at home,
*21:41.940- 21:45.080* :  either with lockdowns or when transportation slowed,
*21:45.700- 21:46.620* :  and they looked online.
*21:46.620- 21:50.520* :  And that was really a boom for a pandemic era online car shopping,
*21:50.880- 21:52.760* :  and it helps to ease this transition.
*21:53.040- 21:55.460* :  Now, for Hyundai, this is two years in the making.
*21:55.460- 21:58.600* :  Their digital showroom itself is five years old,
*21:59.040- 22:02.020* :  and it's a step that customers have proven they want to take.
*22:02.200- 22:04.000* :  And is this going to spread, do you think?
*22:04.000- 22:06.280* :  Because obviously it's not just Amazon, it's not just Hyundai.
*22:06.760- 22:07.820* :  There are lots of car makers,
*22:07.820- 22:10.400* :  lots of other ways of buying online,
*22:10.400- 22:11.780* :  other platforms.
*22:11.780- 22:13.500* :  Is it going to change the way we buy cars?
*22:13.780- 22:15.100* :  Well, it's one of the things we look for,
*22:15.240- 22:18.500* :  right now that this announcement is out who follows suit.
*22:18.620- 22:21.480* :  And in the announcement, Amazon said Hyundai is the first.
*22:21.560- 22:22.780* :  You know, this is new here,
*22:23.260- 22:26.340* :  but it does leave you wondering what can happen next.
*22:27.140- 22:29.180* :  Are you a business correspondent, Erin Delmore?
*22:30.120- 22:32.480* :  An annual award for the best non-fiction book
*22:32.480- 22:36.160* :  has been won by an account of wildfires in Canada in 2016,
*22:36.160- 22:40.020* :  which forced up to 90,000 people to flee their homes.
*22:40.460- 22:43.120* :  Fire weather, a true story from a hotter world,
*22:43.640- 22:46.400* :  by Canadian American writer John Valliant,
*22:46.820- 22:49.240* :  is the first winner of the Bayley Gifford Prize
*22:49.240- 22:51.320* :  to focus on the impact of climate change.
*22:51.720- 22:54.160* :  He's been telling Nick Robinson more about the story.
*22:54.800- 22:58.620* :  Fort McMurray is a petroleum boom town,
*22:58.620- 23:03.020* :  about 600 miles north of the U.S. border in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada.
*23:03.740- 23:06.380* :  There's a population of about 90,000 people there.
*23:07.140- 23:09.680* :  The median household income in 2016,
*23:09.680- 23:13.680* :  when this fire occurred, was $200,000 a year,
*23:14.000- 23:15.560* :  an extraordinarily wealthy place,
*23:16.420- 23:19.500* :  completely devoted to rendering a bitumen
*23:20.040- 23:22.700* :  into a low-grade petroleum product,
*23:22.700- 23:24.640* :  which they sell into the U.S.,
*23:24.840- 23:30.200* :  and it's the largest source of foreign imports into the United States.
*23:30.200- 23:36.560* :  And in May 2016, the entire city was overrun by a wildfire.
*23:37.420- 23:39.660* :  And it was that connection I can already see,
*23:40.220- 23:42.640* :  the connection between how they got their money,
*23:43.220- 23:44.340* :  and what happened to them,
*23:44.340- 23:47.140* :  is this extreme weather event that attracted you to the story?
*23:47.600- 23:50.080* :  The irony of a town that makes its money
*23:50.080- 23:51.840* :  by rendering bitumen,
*23:51.840- 23:57.600* :  by burning billions of cubic feet of natural gas every single day,
*23:58.320- 24:00.200* :  to render a low-grade petroleum product,
*24:00.580- 24:04.240* :  then catching on fire due to the forest around it,
*24:04.360- 24:08.060* :  that they've been bulldozing off for years in order to access the bitumen.
*24:08.660- 24:10.160* :  You know, there isn't irony there,
*24:10.680- 24:15.520* :  but there was also genuine terror and risk to human life
*24:15.520- 24:17.740* :  that was terrible to behold.
*24:18.280- 24:19.720* :  This is not just a plebbing, though.
*24:19.720- 24:21.000* :  Is it all you're saying, sir?
*24:21.000- 24:21.200* :  Not at all.
*24:21.200- 24:22.060* :  This is a story.
*24:22.220- 24:24.100* :  It's really more of a parable.
*24:24.100- 24:28.040* :  And as I came to understand this fire,
*24:28.560- 24:32.400* :  the temperature up there was 33 Celsius in May.
*24:32.400- 24:34.720* :  There was ice on the local lakes.
*24:34.920- 24:38.320* :  There were car-sized blocks of ice on the Athabascar River.
*24:38.640- 24:41.660* :  Winter had just ended, and yet it was 33 Celsius.
*24:42.160- 24:44.820* :  The relative humidity was comparable to Death Valley,
*24:45.480- 24:48.560* :  and the flames coming out of the forest into the city
*24:49.100- 24:52.080* :  were pushing radiant heat of 500 Celsius.
*24:52.660- 24:54.480* :  And so houses, entire houses,
*24:55.000- 24:57.080* :  burnt to the basement in five minutes.
*24:58.000- 24:58.880* :  You say it's a parable.
*24:59.940- 25:01.140* :  You wrote it for a purpose.
*25:01.360- 25:01.800* :  I see.
*25:01.800- 25:05.920* :  You want to say to the world to your own country, wake up.
*25:06.120- 25:10.340* :  I really want us to understand how fire behavior has changed.
*25:10.340- 25:15.380* :  So we have supercharged the atmosphere with CO2 and methane
*25:15.380- 25:19.680* :  over the past couple hundred years of ferocious fossil fuel burning.
*25:19.680- 25:22.820* :  And it's empowered us in immeasurable ways.
*25:23.180- 25:27.880* :  What it's also done is empowered our atmosphere to be warmer
*25:28.420- 25:29.980* :  and more conducive to fire.
*25:30.160- 25:33.140* :  So fire literally burns differently now.
*25:33.320- 25:34.980* :  It burns hotter and faster.
*25:35.220- 25:39.000* :  Do you think the prevalence of these fires in North America
*25:39.920- 25:42.240* :  is in any way beginning to change minds
*25:43.140- 25:46.680* :  of people who were skeptical about the need to change their habits,
*25:46.680- 25:50.120* :  to change their consumption, to change their reliance on fossil fuel?
*25:50.160- 25:55.080* :  I think the impacts the climate now are now really undeniable,
*25:55.080- 25:57.160* :  and they've touched almost all of us.
*25:57.260- 25:59.540* :  It's more top of mind than it was,
*25:59.540- 26:03.440* :  and I think people are more willing and able to discuss it.
*26:03.720- 26:07.760* :  But connecting the dots between the fossil fuel industry,
*26:07.760- 26:10.540* :  which is, in essence, a fire industry.
*26:10.680- 26:12.180* :  And we need to make that connection.
*26:13.240- 26:14.100* :  John Valleant.
*26:14.620- 26:16.920* :  And his win comes in a year when Bailey Gifford,
*26:16.920- 26:19.700* :  the investment management company that sponsors the prize,
*26:19.700- 26:24.280* :  has faced criticism for its investments in the fossil fuel industry.
*26:24.280- 26:28.360* :  In October, more than 150 authors and industry professionals
*26:28.360- 26:30.560* :  signed a letter calling on the company
*26:30.560- 26:33.880* :  to divest from oil, coal, and gas projects.
*26:35.660- 26:37.980* :  Now, Snoop Dogg, the American hip hop star,
*26:37.980- 26:40.500* :  is famed for wrapping about money, women, sex,
*26:40.560- 26:42.460* :  and his copious use of marijuana.
*26:43.240- 26:47.540* :  And now he has raised a lot of eyebrows by announcing he's giving up smoking
*26:47.540- 26:49.320* :  in a post on social media.
*26:49.320- 26:49.840* :  He said,
*26:50.420- 26:53.180* :  After much consideration and conversation with my family,
*26:53.180- 26:55.320* :  I've decided to give up smoke.
*26:55.780- 26:58.060* :  Please respect my privacy at this time.
*26:58.060- 27:02.220* :  Our entertainment correspondent Mark Savage has been trying to get to the bottom of it.
*27:02.740- 27:06.220* :  Well, smoke is often used as a euphemism for cannabis or marijuana.
*27:06.260- 27:12.020* :  And so people are assuming that he has decided to give up the drug altogether.
*27:12.060- 27:19.800* :  I do wonder if perhaps as he reaches his mid-50s and lung conditions start to appear on the horizon,
*27:20.400- 27:24.500* :  whether he's giving up the idea of smoking marijuana and maybe going for edibles,
*27:24.540- 27:28.880* :  which is something that he produces with his own cannabis company, Leafs by Snoop.
*27:29.100- 27:31.440* :  I mean, really excessive use in the past, isn't there?
*27:31.660- 27:32.420* :  Absolutely, yeah.
*27:32.580- 27:34.840* :  In an interview with GQ a couple of years ago,
*27:34.840- 27:39.520* :  he said that he smoked 80 joints a day last year on social media.
*27:39.520- 27:41.400* :  He revised that down slightly to nine,
*27:41.520- 27:42.460* :  but that's still a lot.
*27:42.460- 27:44.300* :  And often, if you see him in concert,
*27:44.300- 27:46.460* :  you will see him with a joint in his hand,
*27:46.460- 27:47.740* :  smoking as he performs.
*27:48.200- 27:51.820* :  He even performed at the Super Bowl halftime show last year.
*27:51.820- 27:55.160* :  He didn't smoke there, but he was performing a song called The Next Episode,
*27:55.160- 27:57.720* :  which carries the lyric, I smoke weed every day.
*27:58.140- 28:01.380* :  What reaction has there been so far to this announcement?
*28:02.440- 28:05.360* :  Well, a lot of fans have acted with disbelief.
*28:05.640- 28:07.940* :  One of them said, today's not April Fool's Day,
*28:08.360- 28:12.000* :  another one said, Snoop without smoke is like earth without water.
*28:12.420- 28:17.420* :  But then other people who have had health conditions that have been caused by smoking
