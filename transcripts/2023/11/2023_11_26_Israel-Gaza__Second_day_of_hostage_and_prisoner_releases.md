*00:56.300- 01:00.820* :  situations. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service. I'm Chris Barrow
*01:00.820- 01:05.100* :  and in the early hours of Sunday the 26th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:05.600- 01:09.720* :  Hamas has released the latest group of hostages to the Red Cross for their transfer
*01:09.720- 01:14.780* :  out of Gaza via the RAFA crossing. 39 more Palestinian prisoners have been released by
*01:23.460- 01:26.820* :  Israel in return. Also, tens of thousands of Italians protest against gender-based violence
*01:26.820- 01:30.760* :  after the killing of a young woman allegedly at the hands of her ex-boyfriend.
*01:33.000- 01:37.920* :  Also in this podcast, another major setback for dozens of workers trapped in a collapsed
*01:37.920- 01:43.900* :  tunnel in India. The drilling machine that they were using behind me to drill a hole to try and
*01:43.900- 01:50.200* :  reach the workers that are trapped, that is now broken down completely. And the new Swedish
*01:50.200- 01:53.740* :  ferries designed to cut journeytimes and greenhouse gas emissions.
*01:57.920- 02:03.180* :  There was a delay for several hours but late on Saturday the armed wing of Hamas freed 13
*02:03.180- 02:08.320* :  Israeli hostages and four from Thailand its fighters have been holding in Gaza for the past seven
*02:08.320- 02:14.520* :  weeks. The youngest Israeli is three years old, the eldest 67. Hamas said it had delayed
*02:14.520- 02:18.980* :  handing them over, complaining that promised aides to the north of Gaza hadn't arrived.
*02:19.580- 02:24.460* :  Israel denied violating the terms of the agreement. Well, just like Friday when other hostages
*02:24.460- 02:29.000* :  were released, they were handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza. And just before we recorded this
*02:29.000- 02:34.280* :  edition of the Global News Podcast, the Israeli authorities said that it had released 39 Palestinian
*02:34.280- 02:39.560* :  prisoners, women and teenage boys, as part of the deal, broken by Qatar with the help of the US
*02:39.560- 02:45.500* :  and Egypt. A fighting between Hamas and Israel has been paused for four days so hostages and
*02:45.500- 02:50.520* :  prisoners can be released. For the Palestinians in Gaza, it's a desperately needed opportunity for
*02:50.520- 02:55.600* :  more aides to enter the territory and to get some respite from the war. According to the Hamas
*02:55.600- 03:00.340* :  Run Health Ministry, more than 15,000 people have been killed, the third of them, children.
*03:00.960- 03:06.400* :  For the Israelis, it's a chance to get some of around 240 hostages back home after they were
*03:06.400- 03:11.260* :  abducted by Hamas when it's stormed into southern Israel massacring more than 1200 people.
*03:11.260- 03:19.080* :  I got this update from Tom Bateman in Jerusalem. Well, we know that there are eight children and five
*03:19.080- 03:26.880* :  women among the Israelis released. There are four Thai nationals, as you mentioned. As for the
*03:26.880- 03:33.760* :  Israelis, we know that there are four different families that have more than one member in this
*03:34.300- 03:42.300* :  batch of captives to be released, plus another three people in addition to that. As you mentioned,
*03:42.900- 03:49.840* :  range of ages, the youngest three and a sibling, an eight-year-old from one family, and other two
*03:49.840- 04:00.080* :  members of that family as well, and a 12-year-old girl also among them. So we're starting to get some of
*04:00.080- 04:07.720* :  the details. Once they're in Israel, they're going to be taken to a facility as per yesterday
*04:08.940- 04:13.440* :  at an Israeli air base, where they will have the first chance to speak to
*04:14.020- 04:21.180* :  via phone members of other members of the families, and then we would expect this happened yesterday.
*04:21.180- 04:26.980* :  There will be flown to several different hospitals in Israel, and at that point they'll be reunited
*04:26.980- 04:33.700* :  with their families. We were expecting this release to happen earlier in the day, so why was
*04:33.700- 04:41.440* :  there this delay of quite a long time, several hours? Yeah, that's right. It was quite a
*04:41.500- 04:46.400* :  significant delay, really. The under the agreement is at four o'clock in the afternoon that it's
*04:46.400- 04:53.100* :  expected Hamas to hand over hostages to the Red Cross, and that then triggers, once that's confirmed,
*04:53.100- 05:00.100* :  by the Israeli side in Egypt, the release by the Israelis of Palestinian prisoners that it holds.
*05:00.680- 05:05.860* :  What happened today was that hour came and went with no news, and then within a couple of hours,
*05:05.860- 05:12.420* :  the Al-Qasam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, claimed that Israel had been preventing an
*05:12.420- 05:18.660* :  agreed amount of humanitarian aid, traveling from the south of Gaza into the north, and that
*05:18.660- 05:25.240* :  seemed to be one of the sticking points that they said was preventing the agreement being implemented
*05:25.240- 05:31.420* :  today and why it was being delayed. The Israeli military categorically denied that. It said that
*05:31.420- 05:38.760* :  it coordinated aid getting into the north, but it wasn't responsible for the amount, because the
*05:38.760- 05:46.520* :  United Nations and aid groups, it said, carried that out. But whatever the reason, it was sorted out
*05:48.040- 05:51.800* :  with the mediation of Qatar and the Egyptians who have been brokering all of this,
*05:52.800- 05:59.800* :  and so we then saw what seven hours after it was supposed to happen, a hand over from Hamas
*06:00.320- 06:05.220* :  to the Red Cross, at some location in Gaza that we don't know about, but that took place,
*06:05.980- 06:12.040* :  and then pretty quickly actually, in the Red Cross jeeps, these hostages were taken south to the
*06:12.040- 06:17.820* :  Raffa border crossing, and then over into Egypt. Tom Bateman. Tens of thousands of people have been
*06:17.820- 06:22.720* :  taken to the streets of Rome in protest at the recent murder of a university student. The
*06:22.720- 06:27.520* :  demonstrations on the international day for the elimination of violence against women led to
*06:27.520- 06:31.800* :  gridlock in the centre of Italy's capital. The country's first female prime minister,
*06:31.800- 06:36.900* :  Georgia Maloney, has promised a new educational campaign in schools to combat what she calls
*06:36.900- 06:41.500* :  Italy's culture of misogynistic violence. Sophia Batidza sent this report.
*06:47.400- 06:51.600* :  From Rome to Milan to Palermo, thousands have taken to the streets,
*06:51.600- 06:57.520* :  wearing fuchsia and with their faces painted red. Two colours that have come to represent
*06:57.580- 07:05.080* :  protests against gender violence in Italy. Many holding signs that say, stop asking us what we
*07:05.080- 07:11.220* :  were wearing. This outpouring of anger hasn't been seen in this country for decades. It was
*07:11.220- 07:18.620* :  sparked by the murder of 22-year-old Julia Cicotine, who was killed days before getting her biomedical
*07:18.620- 07:24.580* :  engineering degree. Her ex-boyfriend reportedly couldn't accept that she had ended their relationship.
*07:24.620- 07:30.120* :  The harrowing image of Julia's empty desk on the day she should have graduated,
*07:30.900- 07:36.500* :  struck a chord with many Italian women who feel patriarchal attitudes are entrenched.
*07:36.540- 07:42.820* :  Ilaria Boyano is a women's rights lawyer. In Italy, women react to this feminine side
*07:43.560- 07:49.940* :  without rage because this is the latest killing of a woman based on her desire to free herself
*07:49.940- 07:56.120* :  from an abusive intimate relationship and we can no longer accept the normalisation of such a
*07:56.120- 08:02.120* :  way of understanding intimate relationship and the underestimation of gender-based violence.
*08:02.620- 08:10.780* :  106 women have been killed in Italy so far this year, 87 of them by a partner, ex-partner of
*08:10.780- 08:17.200* :  family member, according to the Italian government. The president Serge Matarella said that behind
*08:17.200- 08:24.940* :  this violence was the failure of a society, unable to promote equal relationships between women and men.
*08:25.460- 08:31.560* :  Sophia Beditzer. Ukraine says the capital Kiv has been hit by the biggest drone attack since the
*08:31.560- 08:36.200* :  start of the war with Russia. Dozens of drones were launched with most of them being shot down.
*08:36.200- 08:40.680* :  President Zelensky has accused Russia of timing the attack to coincide with
*08:40.680- 08:45.500* :  commemorations of what's known as the Holodomor, the man-made famine under the Soviet leader
*08:45.500- 08:51.060* :  Joseph Stalin, which killed millions of people in the 1930s. Are Ukraine correspondent James
*08:51.060- 08:57.340* :  Waterhouse has more details about this latest attack? We've had weeks and weeks of it being
*08:57.340- 09:02.440* :  relatively quiet where you might get the odd siren triggered by a Russian jet taking off across
*09:02.440- 09:07.960* :  the border in Belarus or Russia itself. In that time, the fears were growing that Russia was stockpiling
*09:07.960- 09:13.100* :  weapons. That silence, if you like, abruptly ended this morning, we had about six hours
*09:13.640- 09:19.760* :  of air-raid sirens and we had the constant booms of the city's air defence is working to keep
*09:20.620- 09:26.660* :  around 75 were told Russian drones that were trying to make their way inside the city. It was
*09:26.660- 09:31.200* :  fairly relentless. I think this is a place where no one's had a good night's sleep and I think
*09:31.200- 09:36.120* :  there were also worries that Russia would resume its tactic of targeting Ukrainian infrastructure
*09:36.140- 09:42.980* :  as winter continued to bite in the hope it would deprive people of energy and water. Now around
*09:42.980- 09:48.620* :  sort of 16,000 homes were told in the key of region have been left without power, but I think
*09:48.620- 09:53.300* :  the important point here is if the goal of Russia's strategy of targeting infrastructure was to
*09:53.300- 09:59.460* :  deprive people of those resources, it ultimately failed last year because Ukraine is able to adapt
*09:59.460- 10:05.500* :  and repair fairly quickly, but what these strikes do do is that they can kill, they destroy homes
*10:05.500- 10:10.240* :  and they disrupt lives and I think last night the fear is that it could be the first of many.
*10:10.840- 10:16.320* :  James Waterhouse in Kiev, meanwhile the Russian authorities are taking steps to limit access to
*10:16.320- 10:21.180* :  abortions in an attempt to address the country's falling birth rate. The measures include making
*10:21.180- 10:26.160* :  it an offense to encourage a woman to have an abortion and putting pressure on private clinics
*10:26.160- 10:35.240* :  not to schedule terminations, Vitaly Chevchenko reports. This is the sound that the Russian
*10:35.240- 10:42.200* :  authorities want to hear more often. The country's population declined by more than 5 million in the
*10:42.200- 10:50.220* :  1990s and 2000s, followed by years of demographic stagnation. Russia's population is aging,
*10:50.220- 10:57.980* :  its death rate consistently exceeds its birth rate and the number of abortions is high tea.
*10:58.240- 11:04.420* :  Almost a third of Russian women say they have had one. This means fewer taxpayers,
*11:04.540- 11:12.420* :  fear workers and fear soldiers available to fight for Russia. Some Russian politicians have
*11:12.420- 11:20.040* :  even claimed that abortions are part of a secret war conducted by the West against Russia
*11:20.040- 11:27.620* :  and their language can be extreme. His Russian senator and formerly commissioner for children's rights
*11:27.620- 11:34.360* :  Margarita Pavlovna. Blijaet, na demografiubut, ta sama propaganda vsi wasmoshnok perversi,
*11:34.620- 11:41.500* :  demografi is affected by propaganda of various perversions, child-free, which we are planning to ban,
*11:41.980- 11:48.760* :  LGBT propaganda, propaganda of abortions, giving up children. This is not an accidental process.
*11:48.760- 11:55.200* :  They've long waged war in this grey zone. The Russian authorities have long relied on a
*11:55.200- 12:02.120* :  conservative agenda and their anti-abortion campaign involves the Kremlin-backed orthodox church.
*12:02.380- 12:09.580* :  Here's its head, Patriarch Kirill. Abort nrafsvinen je prijemblien. Abortions are morally
*12:09.580- 12:15.220* :  unacceptable. We live at a time when a decisive review of our demographic policy is necessary
*12:15.220- 12:20.720* :  for the survival of the peoples of Russia. Military actions and the pandemic only make this
*12:20.720- 12:27.960* :  challenge worse. In practice, this means that private clinics across Russia are under pressure
*12:27.960- 12:35.420* :  to stop offering abortions. And many have. In state hospitals, doctors are told to try and
*12:35.420- 12:40.780* :  dissuade women from having an abortion. The health ministry has even drawn up guidelines
*12:40.860- 12:48.560* :  telling medics how best to do it. It is also restricting the sale of medication used to end
*12:48.560- 12:55.700* :  pregnancies. One initiative proposed by Patriarch Kirill and already implemented in parts of Russia
*12:56.260- 13:03.760* :  is a ban on so-called incitement to abortion. And one region, Mardovir, has banned what local
*13:03.760- 13:11.560* :  legislators call abortion propaganda. All this has alarmed pro-choice and feminist groups in Russia.
*13:11.760- 13:17.680* :  Victoria is from an activist group called the Ural's Feminist Initiative. For fear of
*13:17.680- 13:27.140* :  violence and reprisals, we've agreed to only use her first name. This limits women's rights.
*13:27.680- 13:31.480* :  A woman's body belongs to her and she decides what to do with it and its functions.
*13:32.400- 13:36.560* :  Mortality is high and the government needs more people, but they don't care at what price.
*13:39.840- 13:42.600* :  Victoria, they're ending that report by Vitaly Chevchenko.
*13:45.100- 13:46.880* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast.
*13:50.460- 13:56.460* :  It was in black and white and I don't remember why I was so scared, but I hid in the corner of an
*13:56.460- 14:03.340* :  armchair, quivering. We're celebrating the BBC TV science fiction series Doctor Who on its 60th
*14:03.340- 14:13.240* :  anniversary. In 2017, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar fled to Bangladesh
*14:13.240- 14:18.620* :  because of a brutal crackdown on one of the country's ethnic minorities. When our police in
*14:18.620- 14:23.120* :  Southeastern Bangladesh say they've detained Rohingya refugees attempting to set sail to
*14:23.120- 14:28.980* :  Indonesia, officials said the 58 refugees would be sent back to the camps in Cox's Bazaar.
*14:29.440- 14:33.660* :  Selim Uller, who was among those detained, explained why he wanted to leave Bangladesh.
*14:35.180- 14:41.500* :  Here in Bangladesh, we can't do what we've always expected. We can't study. Our children can't study.
*14:42.220- 14:47.660* :  We're suffering a lot. That's why we try to go to Indonesia because we think we can have a better
*14:47.660- 14:52.980* :  life there, better education, better health care. For more, I spoke to our South Asia regional
*14:52.980- 14:58.160* :  editor and Barrasaneta Rajan. There are about a million Rohingya refugees living in the
*14:58.160- 15:03.260* :  Southeastern part of Bangladesh in the District of Cox's Bazaar, close to the Myanmar border.
*15:03.260- 15:09.800* :  And according to local reporters, some of the refugees were going outside the camps on their way
*15:09.800- 15:15.760* :  to town called Technov, which is a border point. A river port from there, they can take the small
*15:15.760- 15:21.580* :  boats and then get on the bigger boats run by these human traffickers. So the police stopped them
*15:22.160- 15:28.680* :  and held them for a while before returning them to the camps. This comes after reports of more
*15:28.680- 15:34.280* :  than a thousand Rohingya refugees landing in the Indonesian province of Acha in the past one month.
*15:34.900- 15:41.140* :  And usually what happens is that in the post-Monson period, when the seas are calm, this is the time
*15:41.140- 15:46.300* :  when lots of these human traffickers and illegal boats, they run in the Bay of Bengal taking
*15:46.300- 15:53.060* :  these refugees to Southeast Asia to countries like Malaysia or Indonesia. After the reports of
*15:53.060- 15:58.200* :  hundreds of people crossing over, now the Bangladesh government has taken action and now they are
*15:58.540- 16:05.120* :  deploying more forces to prevent the refugees taking these perilous journeys in the Bay of Bengal.
*16:05.540- 16:10.040* :  What's the attraction of Indonesia? What's the hope when the refugees arrive if they do manage
*16:10.040- 16:16.160* :  to get as far as that? These refugees have fled violence in Myanmar, following the Myanmar military
*16:16.160- 16:22.560* :  crackdown in 2017 and even before that, they are described as one of the most persecuted minorities
*16:22.560- 16:28.380* :  in the world. So there are about a million people there and the conditions in these camps are
*16:28.380- 16:35.160* :  pretty basic, very crowded, squalid camps and also people are complaining about increasing violence.
*16:35.160- 16:41.420* :  There is an intra-gang violence within these camps and according to Bangladesh police, nearly
*16:41.420- 16:47.480* :  60 people have been killed and there have been abductions and extortions by these criminal gangs
*16:47.480- 16:53.360* :  operating within these camps. Now, many people are willing to take this risk of going on this
*16:53.360- 17:00.060* :  a difficult journey. And Barrison Etirajan. Attempts to rescue 41 construction workers from a
*17:00.060- 17:05.160* :  collapsed tunnel in northern India are on hold while emergency crews wait for more machinery to
*17:05.160- 17:10.360* :  arrive. Officials in the state of Etirakun say the drill being used to work through the rubble is
*17:10.700- 17:17.360* :  Sunita Hembrom's brother-in-law Burendra Kishku is among those traps. She says his mood is deteriorating.
*17:19.520- 17:25.320* :  Just now, I spoke to him. He's upset. He's asking how many days they will stay like this
*17:25.740- 17:31.880* :  and whether something is being done for them or not. He hasn't even eaten today. That's why he's
*17:31.880- 17:36.080* :  worried. Our correspondent Samira Hussein gave us this update from the scene.
*17:36.800- 17:44.460* :  They were constructing a roadway through this mountain when almost two weeks ago a nearby landslide
*17:44.460- 17:51.140* :  crushed the partially built tunnel trapping 41 men inside. Now what's making this rescue effort
*17:51.140- 17:57.200* :  complicated is that because the tunnel was under construction mixed in with all the rubble and debris
*17:57.200- 18:03.820* :  is actually pieces of metal. So what officials are saying now is that look the drilling machine that
*18:03.820- 18:10.080* :  they were using behind me to drill a hole to try and reach the workers that are trapped. That
*18:10.080- 18:15.780* :  is now broken down completely and in order to pull it out it actually needs to pull it out in
*18:15.780- 18:22.640* :  pieces. So they have to summon another piece of machinery from another city in India and that's
*18:22.640- 18:29.520* :  due to arrive late tonight and that machine will then cut the drilling machine into pieces so
*18:29.520- 18:35.140* :  then it can be pulled out. Once they are able to pull that out what they're going to do then
*18:35.540- 18:41.780* :  is go in manually and start taking out the debris in order to reach those rescued workers.
*18:42.660- 18:48.120* :  Samira Hussein there. This year is on course to be the hottest on record with parts of the planet
*18:48.120- 18:54.280* :  experiencing life threatening heat waves devastating fires and flooding. Climate scientists say the
*18:54.280- 19:00.500* :  El Nino current has impacted the statistics and it's set to continue into 2024. Rebecca
*19:00.500- 19:06.340* :  Kesby spoke to Justin Mankin assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth College in the US. He began
*19:06.340- 19:12.420* :  by explaining what the El Nino current is and how it affects our global weather system. El Nino is
*19:12.420- 19:17.860* :  a reversal of the prevailing winds in the tropical Pacific and that essentially means that when
*19:18.120- 19:23.820* :  the trade winds break down all of this warm water that is typically pulled up in the western
*19:23.820- 19:30.140* :  tropical Pacific sloshes eastward and that creates a massive reconfiguration of the way energy
*19:30.140- 19:36.060* :  and therefore weather gets redistributed around our planet. So this is a cycle isn't it? How often
*19:36.060- 19:43.500* :  does it happen? We think it happens on a time scale of two to seven or so years with some variation
*19:43.500- 19:49.020* :  so there's some uncertainty there. And we know that we've got an issue with climate change.
*19:49.020- 19:57.140* :  How is that impacting El Nino? Are climate models that look to how things will change with
*19:57.600- 20:02.920* :  additional global warming point to an enhancement in the intensity of El Nino but the kind of physical
*20:02.920- 20:08.400* :  mechanisms underpinning that enhancement are highly uncertain and anytime an El Nino occurs
*20:09.180- 20:15.940* :  global temperatures tend to be warmer and the types of impacts that we know occur from global
*20:15.980- 20:22.200* :  floods, droughts, heat waves and the like tend to be intensified during El Nino year and we
*20:22.200- 20:27.840* :  anticipate that this El Nino year will be the hottest on record. So I know a lot of your researchers
*20:27.840- 20:34.600* :  been looking into the weather systems in east Africa. We know that they've suffered terrible
*20:34.600- 20:39.940* :  droughts for the past two or three years. What can you tell us about what's happening there?
*20:40.360- 20:46.720* :  Yeah, there's a social context in which these climate impacts are occurring in addition to the
*20:46.720- 20:53.880* :  wider climate context of both El Nino occurring but also in conjunction with what we call an Indian
*20:53.880- 20:59.780* :  Ocean dipole which is another climate pattern that occurs naturally within the climate system
*21:00.180- 21:04.940* :  this time instead of in the Pacific it's in the Indian Ocean and when we have a positive Indian
*21:04.940- 21:12.400* :  Ocean dipole you tend to have warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean
*21:12.460- 21:18.040* :  right along the Horn of Africa and so that just means that there's just more energy to get air
*21:18.040- 21:24.380* :  rising into the atmosphere, create clouds and storms and extremely heavy rainfall and so the
*21:24.380- 21:30.320* :  combination of El Nino which will tend to enhance rainfall and the Indian Ocean dipole being
*21:30.600- 21:36.080* :  favorable. You have this perfect storm so to speak for these once in a century type flood events
*21:36.080- 21:43.460* :  that we're seeing and this is all happening within a deeper context of an incredibly severe three
*21:43.460- 21:50.180* :  year drought that's prevailed in the region and the social context there is owing to the drought
*21:50.220- 21:56.260* :  and geopolitical instabilities 18 million internally displaced people so these are people
*21:56.260- 22:05.100* :  that are effectively have no food security no health security no homes and now they're experiencing
*22:05.100- 22:12.580* :  record-breaking floods. Professor of Geography Justin Mankin there. A stock hope the Swedish capital
*22:12.580- 22:18.080* :  has come up with a way of cutting travel time and saving energy by investing millions in new
*22:18.080- 22:23.600* :  battery-powered ferries to replace the current diesel-powered fleet. The new boats expected to be
*22:23.600- 22:29.060* :  introduced by next summer have fins underneath which lift them out of the water producing the
*22:29.060- 22:32.960* :  energy needed to power them. Spencer Kelly has been on board a prototype.
*22:42.660- 22:49.660* :  This is the Candela P12 the prototype of a ferry which should go into service in July 2024.
*22:51.500- 22:57.600* :  Narrow wings called hydrofoils provide huge amounts of lift. In the same way the aircraft
*22:57.600- 23:03.520* :  wings can get a plane off the ground these wings can raise the whole hull above the surface.
*23:07.340- 23:14.260* :  Gustav Hasselcock is the CEO of Candela. Normal boats consume awful local fuel and they are
*23:14.260- 23:19.220* :  extremely inefficient compared to land-based transport and this is because the boat is trying to
*23:19.220- 23:22.200* :  push his way through the water there's a lot of resistance isn't that a lot of friction in the
*23:22.200- 23:28.000* :  water. You can use batteries on ferries if they run very slowly but whenever you want to go a bit
*23:28.000- 23:33.060* :  faster a bit longer distances then it sort of the whole thing perhaps because you could of course
*23:33.060- 23:37.820* :  put in more batteries but at the end you put in so much batteries that the boat will sink so you
*23:37.820- 23:43.440* :  have sort of a physical limit here that you can't get around. There's another advantage to being
*23:43.440- 23:48.420* :  almost entirely out of the water too because as well as not feeling the waves it doesn't make
*23:48.420- 23:54.280* :  them either and that's good for everything that lives here. Michaela Harga runs the Maritime
*23:54.280- 24:01.280* :  Public Transport Committee for Stockholm. Traditional ferries creates big wakes and when it dries
*24:01.280- 24:07.840* :  in our sensitive archipelago it's a really sensitive ecological system with marine life and
*24:07.840- 24:14.600* :  we have the birds and the fishes it causes erosion from the shorelines and that's a really big
*24:14.600- 24:21.940* :  challenge for us and we need to reduce the wakes to be able to drive more in a sustainable way
*24:21.940- 24:28.720* :  in our sensitive environment. There is a limit to the size of the swell this type of craft could
*24:28.720- 24:36.700* :  cope with but on inland waterways this technology may very well soon be making waves by not making
*24:36.700- 24:42.840* :  waves. Although like a lot of modern life the smooth ride will depend on the computers and sensors
*24:42.840- 24:52.760* :  doing their jobs at all times which is no mean feat. Why is nobody made an electric hydrofoil flying
*24:52.760- 25:00.000* :  ferry before? I think the main reason is that it's freaking hard. It does sound pretty difficult
*25:00.000- 25:06.780* :  that was Spencer Kelly from BBC Click. Now the BBC Science Fiction Television Series Doctor Who has
*25:06.780- 25:12.800* :  been celebrating its 60th anniversary. The time travelling time lord and his time machine,
*25:12.800- 25:17.800* :  the TARDIS, returned to UK screens on Saturday and all those new episodes will be streamed
*25:17.800- 25:24.420* :  around the world on Disney+. The series has terrified viewers, had them hiding behind the sofa for
*25:24.420- 25:29.300* :  many many years so to mark its return we've been hearing from fans among them are international
*25:29.300- 25:33.540* :  editor Jeremy Bowen but to start with the BBC News presenter Martha Carney.
*25:37.740- 25:44.360* :  We used to watch from behind the sofa especially when there was the blood-curdling exterminate.
*25:44.540- 25:52.160* :  Anyway our village fate one summer a Dalek appeared alongside the then Doctor Who William Hartnell
*25:52.360- 25:54.620* :  and I had to say we talked about it for years.
*25:59.920- 26:05.880* :  My name is Arabella Weir and the first time I watched Doctor Who was with my older brothers
*26:05.880- 26:12.600* :  in the early 1960s and I was absolutely petrified.
*26:16.260- 26:22.260* :  It was in black and white and I don't remember why I was so scared but I hid in the corner of an
*26:22.260- 26:29.180* :  armchair quivering and then much later in my life I became great friends with an actor who
*26:29.180- 26:35.700* :  was desperate to become Doctor Who and then did and then I knew other actors who became Doctor Who
*26:35.780- 26:43.240* :  and in fact I'm the centre of a then diagram in which Scottish people become Doctor Who and then
*26:43.240- 26:50.860* :  I was in a Doctor Who Christmas special a few years ago with Bill Bailey and that was a great deal of fun.
*26:57.860- 27:03.020* :  Well here are my memories of watching Doctor Who and it was normally from behind a cushion
*27:03.340- 27:08.220* :  on the sofa with my two brothers sometimes from behind the sofa quite like the Dalek's who
*27:08.220- 27:18.320* :  did a good Dalek impersonation. I am a Dalek exterminate, exterminate but the Cybermen they were
*27:18.320- 27:26.700* :  really scary. You know we love to be terrified. We were waiting there before it started with the
*27:26.700- 27:38.640* :  cushions ready for those moments of peak fear. My name is Sophie Aldrid and I play ace companion of
*27:38.640- 27:46.460* :  the Seventh Doctor Sylvester McCoy and the Thirteenth Doctor Jody Whitaker. My real strong memory of
*27:46.460- 27:52.960* :  Doctor Who was of a jumper we story called the Green Death and I can remember these great big
*27:52.960- 28:00.260* :  giant maggots which were wriggling away on a hillside in Wales which I later found out were made
*28:00.260- 28:08.300* :  by the visual effects department out of condoms. My name is Janet Ellis I mostly have you
*28:08.300- 28:14.020* :  heard about it in 1979 I played Princess Tika not the curry different spelling in the horns of
*28:14.020- 28:20.000* :  Nimon but when I was a child the theme tune alone was sinister and from the age of eight I was
*28:20.000- 28:25.720* :  frightened in no particular order or Dalek's Cybermen ice warriors and that creeping,
*28:25.720- 28:31.520* :  creepy jelly stuff the behavior of the adults was alarming too the especially the assistants who
*28:31.520- 28:36.460* :  seemed to hellbent on finding danger don't go there don't open that door what are you doing?
*28:36.660- 28:44.040* :  You dare to speak to me of failure. I appeared when Tom Baker was the doctor and our monsters were
*28:44.040- 28:49.860* :  nine months they were fearsome bull-like beasts no daylight on the magic but they weren't real
*28:49.860- 28:55.720* :  monsters and this of course your eight and the theme tune starts and you're going to be safely
*28:55.980- 29:02.400* :  but very properly scared thanks for the thrills you delicious series can I do it again?
*29:07.880- 29:13.760* :  Janet Ellis celebrating Doctor Who's 60th anniversary and Jeremy Bowen doing an impression of a Dalek
