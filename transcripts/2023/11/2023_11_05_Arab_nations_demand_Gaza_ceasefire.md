*01:17.040- 01:22.340* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Sunday, the 5th of November, these are our main
*01:22.340- 01:26.960* :  stories. Our Foreign Minister as meeting in Jordan have told the US Secretary of State
*01:26.960- 01:32.980* :  there must be an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The UN says one of its schools in the Jabalya camp
*01:32.980- 01:38.900* :  was hit by an air strike. The Army in Guinea says the former military-ruler Musadad's camera is
*01:38.900- 01:46.800* :  back in prison, hours after he was freed in an armed assault. Also in this podcast.
*01:47.180- 01:50.960* :  You need to get rid of that, what we call angular momentum, that rotation and the way
*01:50.960- 01:55.700* :  these baby stars do is by ejecting material from both ends. So there's the analogy with the babies
*01:55.700- 02:00.840* :  if you like. They burp occasionally and they throw material out. The problem for baby stars,
*02:00.940- 02:12.920* :  growing up. Israel is committing war crimes. That's what the Jordanian Foreign Minister Iman Safadi
*02:12.920- 02:18.080* :  told the American Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, on Saturday, as he toured the region,
*02:18.080- 02:23.840* :  trying to stop the war between Hamas and Israel getting even worse. Mr. Safadi made those
*02:23.840- 02:30.700* :  remarks in Arabic. In English, he was only a little less stark. We cannot allow this war to
*02:30.700- 02:37.560* :  undermine all that has been done to bring about just peace to the region. With every missile
*02:37.560- 02:44.180* :  unleashed on Gaza, with every killing of a Palestinian child, the whole region is sinking
*02:44.460- 02:51.380* :  in a sea of hatred that will define generations to come. It was striking language coming from Jordan,
*02:51.380- 02:57.320* :  which was the second Arab state after Egypt to sign a peace deal with Israel. Mr. Blinken met
*02:57.320- 03:02.780* :  Mr. Safadi and other Arab foreign ministers in Iman. He went there from Israel where the Prime Minister
*03:02.780- 03:08.780* :  Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday he would not agree to oppose in his country's attacks on Gaza
*03:08.780- 03:14.020* :  until all Israeli hostages were released. But the Arab foreign ministers told Mr. Blinken
*03:14.020- 03:19.160* :  there must be an immediate cessation of hostilities. Mr. Blinken said while it was important
*03:19.160- 03:24.140* :  to make sure the kind of attack that Hamas unleashed four weeks ago did not happen again,
*03:24.140- 03:30.860* :  Israel must minimize civilian casualties, and without a humanitarian pause, that wasn't possible.
*03:31.640- 03:37.160* :  We believe pauses can be a critical mechanism for protecting civilians, for getting aid in,
*03:38.000- 03:42.420* :  for getting foreign nationals out, while still enabling Israel to achieve its objective,
*03:43.000- 03:50.900* :  to defeat Hamas. Yesterday I spoke in depth with Israeli leaders about how, when and where such
*03:50.900- 03:56.060* :  arrangements could be implemented, and what needs to be done to make them possible. Today,
*03:56.060- 04:02.000* :  regional partners discussed many, the same question. A correspondent Anthony Zirker is traveling
*04:02.000- 04:07.900* :  with Mr. Blinken and told us more. I think what he's trying to do is find some middle ground between
*04:07.900- 04:15.260* :  what these Arab counterparts are insisting, which is a full ceasefire, and what the Israelis want to do,
*04:15.260- 04:21.040* :  which is continue to prosecute their war against Hamas with no pauses whatsoever. Of course,
*04:21.040- 04:26.960* :  that's a difficult middle ground because his suggestions of humanitarian pauses have been
*04:26.960- 04:33.580* :  rejected by both sides, but he's trying to make the case that humanitarian pauses would allow
*04:33.580- 04:42.480* :  aid to reach the gossens who need it the most, and also perhaps facilitate the release of hostages,
*04:42.960- 04:50.560* :  while a complete ceasefire would instead would allow Hamas to regroup and conduct more military
*04:50.560- 04:56.060* :  operations against the Israelis in the future. So he's walking a fine line here, but at least at
*04:56.060- 05:02.600* :  the moment he's caught in a pincher between these two sides. And is the future of Gaza being
*05:02.600- 05:09.480* :  addressed already, including the Arab attitude to Hamas, whatever happens when this conflict finally
*05:09.480- 05:15.160* :  ends? Well, it's interesting. Anthony Blinken has been saying from the start that all the parties
*05:15.160- 05:19.960* :  in the region need to think about day two, not just what's happening right now with the conflict,
*05:20.000- 05:26.640* :  but a way to ensure a lasting and durable peace going forward. And he talked about that again
*05:26.700- 05:33.880* :  on Saturday with his Arab partners, but that was something that the Jordanian minister dismissed
*05:33.880- 05:40.180* :  rather quickly when asked about it. He said that he has to focus on what is going on right now
*05:40.180- 05:47.720* :  and ending the conflict right now, and that they can address the situation for the gossens after
*05:47.720- 05:53.180* :  that is taken care of because he said they don't even know what kind of condition Gaza will be
*05:53.180- 06:00.380* :  after Israel concludes its military campaign. So it's pointless to think about what role Hamas would
*06:00.380- 06:05.740* :  play in Gaza, for instance, and what kind of long-term solution there could be. Although all the
*06:05.740- 06:11.040* :  parties in the press conference this evening did agree that ultimately peace in the Middle East
*06:11.040- 06:17.720* :  is going to hinge on a two-state solution for the Palestinians, giving them their own state separate
*06:17.720- 06:24.520* :  from the Israelis. And in concrete terms, while this conflict goes on, Mr. Blinken spoke about
*06:24.520- 06:31.360* :  extending aid delivery through the RAFA crossing, do you think there's going to be anything concrete
*06:31.360- 06:35.960* :  coming out of this meeting in terms of that? Well, nothing has been publicly announced
*06:35.960- 06:44.840* :  certainly. Earlier on Saturday, State Department officials did say that they could see as many as
*06:45.160- 06:52.320* :  500 or 600 trucks eventually going through that crossing. It all depends on improving the ability
*06:52.920- 07:00.180* :  of the humanitarian assistance individuals on the ground there to distribute the aid. It's not
*07:00.180- 07:05.600* :  so much getting the trucks to the border but getting them through the border and getting the people
*07:05.600- 07:12.220* :  who need them. So it's the American view that humanitarian aid through that crossing can be ramped
*07:12.220- 07:17.440* :  up that it is something that the Israelis will support. But right now it's a matter of trying to
*07:17.440- 07:23.200* :  figure out a way to once those trucks get in there distributing the aid effectively. Anthony Zurker.
*07:23.860- 07:29.120* :  The United Nations Refugee Agency Anowa said one of its schools housing displaced civilians
*07:29.120- 07:35.420* :  in Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza was hit by a strike. The Hamas-Ron Health Ministry said at least
*07:35.420- 07:41.420* :  15 people were killed with dozens more wounded. My aunt lives near the school. She told the BBC
*07:41.420- 07:46.020* :  she'd run to the scene when she heard it had been hit and described what she found.
*08:11.900- 08:19.320* :  My relatives are there. I want to see them that they they're still alive. I heard the explosion and
*08:19.320- 08:25.800* :  there was a radio and someone told me that the El Fakhura School has been attacked. I went to
*08:25.800- 08:35.180* :  on foot. I walked 20 minutes to reach them in a critical, serious situation in the streets. I
*08:35.180- 08:41.080* :  was very afraid. I wasn't a middle of the street when the people started to run away. Of course,
*08:41.080- 08:48.080* :  I ran away also. It was horrible. We are civilians. We are simple people. We need only
*08:48.080- 08:55.520* :  peace. We want to stop these massacres. Everyone or all the Arab or Europe, you are saying everyone
*08:55.520- 09:03.660* :  to ask Israel just to stop killing people. Anowa's Juliet Tumar told the BBC that thousands of
*09:03.660- 09:09.320* :  people were sheltering at the El Fakhura School in the north of the territory. Among the casualties,
*09:09.320- 09:17.960* :  among those killed, are also believed to be children. The school got a hit in its courtyard
*09:17.960- 09:25.000* :  where there were tents for displaced families and then another hit came next to a wall of the
*09:25.000- 09:30.880* :  school where women were baking bread. Israel said the facility had been near an exchange of
*09:30.880- 09:36.240* :  fire with Hamas fighters who were deploying mortars. I got more details from our correspondent
*09:36.240- 09:41.380* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. I think that episode that you just described is really indicative of
*09:41.380- 09:46.720* :  the reality of life in the northern part of the Gaza Strip and especially in Gaza City and the
*09:46.720- 09:51.740* :  surrounding areas at the moment because that is a war zone. The entire area is now a war zone.
*09:52.260- 09:58.040* :  No aid is getting in there and there are by some estimates as many as three to four hundred
*09:58.040- 10:04.020* :  thousand civilians who have either have not been able to or have chosen to or have not been able
*10:04.820- 10:09.660* :  to get out and to obey those Israeli instructions to move to the south. And as a result,
*10:09.660- 10:16.400* :  they find themselves in the middle of active fighting and it is I'm afraid utterly inevitable
*10:16.460- 10:23.720* :  that any civilians who are still in that area will be extremely vulnerable to and incidents
*10:23.720- 10:29.600* :  just like this. We know that Israeli forces are within a few minutes drive of the Sheifa hospital
*10:30.460- 10:34.280* :  where again we think that there are thousands of Palestinian civilians sheltering.
*10:34.640- 10:41.240* :  So the longer this phase of the campaign goes on and in the absence of any meaningful humanitarian
*10:41.240- 10:46.040* :  pauses, I'm afraid we're going to have more of this. One thing I should point out is that the
*10:46.040- 10:51.560* :  Israelis said that they were going to open the road, the main north-south road, for about three
*10:51.560- 10:56.920* :  hours to allow civilians to leave. I don't know how many people tried to do that, but the Israelis
*10:56.920- 11:02.340* :  said that they were actually fired on by Hamas Gunman in that area in what the Israelis
*11:02.340- 11:08.480* :  describe as an effort to try and prevent civilians from leaving. So that's another indication of
*11:08.480- 11:12.300* :  the complexity of the situation there in the northern Gaza Strip at the moment.
*11:13.100- 11:18.000* :  Well that's the north of the Gaza Strip, so what's happening in the south? We've had this report
*11:18.000- 11:24.920* :  from our correspondent, Rushdie Abu Aluf, in Karnunis. The people saying that the road leads to the
*11:24.920- 11:30.920* :  southern part is completely damaged and there is no access for cars to move. Well a few cars,
*11:30.920- 11:36.260* :  hundreds of cars arrived to the area and they couldn't move to the south. Very few people who
*11:36.260- 11:41.640* :  managed to get out of the car and walk and we understand there was Israeli checkpoint with tanks
*11:41.640- 11:47.320* :  in the area and they were checking people's ID and then they processed some of the people there.
*11:47.820- 11:52.120* :  Why people are not leaving about half million people still in Gaza City and the north?
*11:52.180- 11:58.700* :  Because they believe if you ask any Palestinians they say no place is safe and the Israelis keep
*11:58.700- 12:05.280* :  targeting places in the so-called if area where I am standing in a Karnunis. Yesterday I went to
*12:05.280- 12:10.680* :  cover a after-math of an airstrike and people were digging with their hands under the
*12:10.680- 12:17.620* :  rodul to get five kids under the building was taken down 15 people were killed. Also the city
*12:17.620- 12:23.240* :  of Karnunis which now accommodate like half half of the population over a million people here.
*12:23.800- 12:29.660* :  There is no space in the streets people are sleeping in the streets even in the hospital here in
*12:29.660- 12:35.780* :  Karnunis, Nasr Hospital. Thousands of people are taking the hospital as a shelter. They are
*12:35.780- 12:42.020* :  sleeping on the ground they don't have a place to go. In fact some when the road was open at the
*12:42.020- 12:47.400* :  beginning of the Israeli ground operation some who are who were displaced and they live in Karnunis
*12:47.660- 12:55.980* :  they go back to Gaza City. Rushdie Abu al-Aluf in Karnunis. Thousands of pro-Palestinian
*12:55.980- 13:06.920* :  demonstrators marched in Washington and in London on Saturday. Britain and other countries have
*13:06.920- 13:13.120* :  also seen rising numbers of both anti-Semitic and Islamophobic attacks. Around a decade or so
*13:13.120- 13:19.900* :  here in the UK two women Laura Marx who's Jewish and Julie Siddiqui who's Muslim co-founded the
*13:19.900- 13:25.540* :  network Nisan Ashim to bring together women from both communities to lead outreach and into
*13:25.540- 13:32.100* :  faith projects in their local area. Let's hear from them. First Julie Siddiqui. We've always put
*13:32.100- 13:36.220* :  friendship at the heart of it and actually said to people you know don't create the friendship
*13:36.620- 13:40.620* :  just based on what's happening in that part of the world and of course at the moment we're all
*13:40.620- 13:46.240* :  very very live to it stuff like this travels and it really matters to both of these communities in
*13:46.240- 13:52.640* :  particular. I'm seeing a mixed picture actually I'm seeing people who threw Nisan Ashim and other
*13:52.640- 13:58.700* :  in other spaces who thought they had friendship and thought they had the trust between each other
*13:58.860- 14:04.040* :  but this situation is very very testing for them. I've also seen though other people who perhaps
*14:04.040- 14:09.320* :  haven't ever really even built into this kind of work actually saying to me it's really interesting
*14:09.320- 14:13.280* :  to me that you're doing this right now you're in the ring you're in the trenches that's it we're
*14:13.640- 14:17.420* :  trying to keep hold of these relationships I'd really like to know more about that and maybe it's
*14:17.420- 14:22.400* :  something I want to get more information about so I think for me actually the little glimmers of hope
*14:22.400- 14:28.120* :  the connections that people have with each other the the hand holding all of that is still happening
*14:28.120- 14:35.140* :  despite how difficult it is there is a lot of fear in the Jewish community and the levels of hate
*14:35.140- 14:42.480* :  towards Israel which spill over so easily into anti-semitism do really genuinely frightened people
*14:42.480- 14:50.000* :  and I'm a fifth generation British Jew even I'm thinking this just doesn't feel comfortable this
*14:50.000- 14:57.060* :  doesn't feel right so the chanting which we are hearing way too much of which is full of hate
*14:57.060- 15:04.380* :  very often I really wish people could understand how this stuff is received and that we could just
*15:04.380- 15:10.720* :  put ourselves a little bit into people's shoes I take exception actually to people in government even
*15:10.720- 15:15.820* :  who are calling all of these marches hate marches because I don't believe that's very helpful to
*15:15.820- 15:22.220* :  use that kind of language I know people that go to these kinds of marches how do we navigate all of
*15:22.220- 15:27.380* :  that well it feels almost impossible sometimes frankly when you're talking about the numbers that
*15:27.380- 15:31.560* :  we're talking about but there's no doubt the fear that's created in the Jewish community to me it's
*15:31.560- 15:37.240* :  not okay of course it's not okay that then comes down to what education it comes down to people
*15:37.240- 15:42.420* :  meeting each other you know when you've got good people who are saying very bad things something
*15:42.420- 15:47.220* :  has gone wrong there somewhere and we need that education and that understanding which can only
*15:47.220- 15:54.680* :  actually happen when people meet each other Julie Sediki and Laura Marx other news now and if you
*15:54.680- 16:01.280* :  could go back 4.6 billion years and take a picture of our son in its infancy what would it look like
*16:01.780- 16:07.380* :  well thanks to images captured by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope we now have an idea
*16:07.380- 16:13.720* :  and the image of the baby star in the constellation of Orion is striking it's thought to be just
*16:13.720- 16:20.740* :  50,000 years old and newborn compared to our son Mark McCorkrenn is a senior advisor for science
*16:20.740- 16:27.000* :  and exploration at the European Space Agency and he's been studying this baby star since 1993
*16:27.260- 16:33.440* :  Rebecca Kezby asked him how a baby's son becomes an adult it's got to take in material it's got
*16:33.440- 16:38.020* :  to feed and it does that from a cloud of gas and dust surrounding it but it actually also has to
*16:38.020- 16:43.520* :  get rid of some material and the reason for that is that these clouds are spinning and the more they
*16:43.520- 16:47.520* :  contract down the more they get smaller they spin faster like an ice skater does when they pull their
*16:47.520- 16:52.160* :  arms in and you need to get rid of that what we call angular momentum that rotation and the way
*16:52.160- 16:56.900* :  these baby stars do is by ejecting material from both ends and so there's the analogy with the babies
*16:56.900- 17:01.840* :  if you like they burp occasionally and they throw material out that material spinning but it's
*17:01.840- 17:06.140* :  in the form of a linear jet that's ejected out and that's what we see in these images from the
*17:06.140- 17:10.800* :  James Webb Space Telescope I mean there's always mind bending numbers when it comes to space and the
*17:10.800- 17:17.080* :  age of things what does this one tell us about our own son and indeed life well that's the very
*17:17.080- 17:21.340* :  early phase that we're seeing here so that's as it's still growing and this star is probably about
*17:21.340- 17:26.720* :  half the size of our son today but it could get up to be roughly the size of our son but it's
*17:26.720- 17:30.620* :  this ejection of this material out into space that we're really fascinated by because that
*17:30.620- 17:35.280* :  dominates everything in these early phases we know there's some chemistry there going on as well
*17:35.280- 17:39.800* :  so maybe we'll see some molecules that could get incorporated into planets in the next few
*17:39.800- 17:44.280* :  million years but this is just you know really about those very earliest phases how do you feed
*17:44.280- 17:49.680* :  and get rid of that angular momentum simultaneously it's quite close to the horse head nebula which is
*17:49.680- 17:54.400* :  in the belt of Orion so in the wintertime now if you look out in the in the evening time you'll
*17:54.400- 17:59.020* :  see Orion standing in the sky and has this belt across the middle and the sword hanging below it
*17:59.420- 18:07.300* :  and it's just off to the left end of the leftmost star there what we see is a line of glowing hydrogen
*18:07.360- 18:12.580* :  gas we only see it in the infrared so you couldn't see it with the naked eye we see it going out
*18:12.580- 18:18.460* :  symmetrically on both sides and spanning a line which is about a couple of light years wide so it's

*24:10.460- 24:16.940* :  an attempt to towards that it's not exactly clear how mr kamar's lawyer dole has you know
*24:16.940- 24:22.440* :  been at pains to stress that he's kind wasn't involved in today's abduction that you know he
*24:22.440- 24:26.840* :  had nothing to do with it he was taking against his will he says that he was kidnapped that he has
*24:27.280- 24:32.240* :  you know trust in the guinea judicial system so there's no way he would try and escape prison so
*24:32.240- 24:36.780* :  that's that's laid out a bit of doubts there as to whether mr kamar knew he was going to be
*24:36.780- 24:41.440* :  abducted today and wasn't involved in all of this but i think overall what this highlights is
*24:41.440- 24:46.780* :  just what a fragile state guinea is in at the moment you know more than a couple of years since
*24:46.780- 24:52.640* :  had its last coup it's showing some sort of cracks in within its ranks because as the minister of
*24:53.020- 24:57.880* :  justice was saying on local radio earlier today they need to investigate how mr kamar and
*24:57.880- 25:03.140* :  and these three other men how they were able to to escape the prison given how heavily protected it is
*25:03.400- 25:09.120* :  my any jones ukraine's president velody mrs lenske says the war between israel and her mass
*25:09.120- 25:14.560* :  is taking away the focus from the conflict in his country he was speaking at a news conference in

*25:20.240- 25:25.880* :  Eberhardt reports the focus of president zalenske's talks with Ursula von der Leyen was on progress
*25:25.880- 25:31.300* :  towards getting formal EU accession talks approved from what the commission boss said that is
*25:31.300- 25:36.720* :  going well the more crucial situation regarding ukraine's fight against russian invaders seems
*25:36.720- 25:42.740* :  less positive mr zalenske denied fighting had reached a stalemate despite a recent assessment
*25:42.740- 25:47.420* :  of this effect by ukraine's top general but he acknowledged that people were tired
*25:47.420- 25:52.120* :  mr zalenske also denied he was coming under pressure to consider peace talks with russia
*25:52.600- 25:58.000* :  following a report in the u.s media his country would not sit down with mosco to work out what
*25:58.000- 26:03.560* :  to give it he stressed what ukraine needed he said was to work more with allies on air defense
*26:03.580- 26:08.580* :  and freeing up skies from russian control to give its military the chance to liberate territory
*26:09.160- 26:14.460* :  a concerted counter offensive by ukraine since the summer has failed to deliver decisive gains
*26:14.460- 26:20.440* :  against entrenched russian defenses and political wranglings in the united states about military aid
*26:20.440- 26:27.880* :  only complicates the picture for Kiev Danny Eberhardt a you dubbed Britain's loneliest sheep
*26:27.900- 26:33.360* :  has been rescued from a remote shore in the scottish highlands she'd been stranded at the foot
*26:33.360- 26:38.900* :  of cliffs on the chromity firth for at least two years but a group of five farmers decided
*26:38.900- 26:45.620* :  to intervene a Charlotte read reports the sheep was first spotted on the shoreline in 2021 by a
*26:45.620- 26:51.460* :  kayaker and on a recent return trip to the same spot she said she was shocked to discover that
*26:51.460- 26:56.060* :  the sheep was still stuck there and began a campaign pleading for someone to help
*26:56.960- 27:02.260* :  after hearing about their plight in the media five farmers decided they would lead a rescue mission
*27:06.820- 27:11.960* :  they managed to drag the you which they've called Fiona up a steep slope and back to safety
*27:12.280- 27:17.100* :  Britain's loneliest sheep is lonely no more she has lots of friends she has major operations
*27:17.380- 27:23.020* :  the efforts were organised by kamy wilson a sheepshira the scottish sbca were also in attendance
*27:23.020- 27:28.940* :  they say Fiona is in good health but her overgrown fleece needs to be dealt with apparently a job
*27:28.940- 27:36.140* :  for tomorrow according to those who rescue her Charlotte read they live in your bed crawl out at
*27:36.140- 27:41.940* :  night and drink your blood while you sleep so there is understandable concern at reports of
*27:42.000- 27:48.220* :  bed bug infestations in major European cities like Paris and London but even for those who've never
*27:48.220- 27:53.340* :  been bitten it seems the very mention of the creatures is enough to make some people feel itchy
*27:53.340- 28:00.100* :  and stressed and Stephanie printers told Oliver Conway why i mean i'm itchy and stressed even thinking
*28:00.100- 28:05.300* :  about this but the BBC has been speaking to some psychologists about it it's all about the
*28:05.300- 28:10.540* :  brain's ability to connect a thought to a mental image with a physical sensation a kind of mind
*28:10.540- 28:15.720* :  body connection so bed bugs for anyone that's ever had them they're very itchy they get read they
*28:15.720- 28:19.900* :  swell up and of course there's this idea of something feeding on you while you sleep that just
*28:19.900- 28:25.040* :  scuss people it's the only one that's had an infestation before i've been bitten by any insect
*28:25.040- 28:30.540* :  has got the propensity to imagine how that would feel so in terms of the process you think about
*28:30.540- 28:35.360* :  the bug and the bite the brain starts gearing up it's activating past memories or mental images
*28:35.840- 28:41.520* :  sparking neural pathways and then comes those itchy sort of crawly skin sensations it happens
*28:41.520- 28:47.840* :  very quickly it's called psychogenic itching which is an itch with no real cause and i mean it kind
*28:47.840- 28:53.200* :  of goes up saying but the more someone feels fear or disgust about an idea like a bed bug bite
*28:53.200- 29:01.360* :  the more likely it is to happen and bed bug anxiety is on the rise it seems it is i mean bed bugs
*29:01.360- 29:06.700* :  are no joke if you've got them they're really hard to get rid of some scientists say they actually
*29:06.700- 29:11.720* :  survive the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs and they primarily live what people see
*29:11.720- 29:16.620* :  as a safe space it's your bedroom it's not wanting to deal with them that's legitimate fear but
*29:16.900- 29:22.360* :  the recent boom in cases that's being covered widely in european media at least and it's caused a
*29:22.360- 29:27.480* :  spike in anxiety around the idea of them that's according to those psychologists the BBC's been
*29:27.480- 29:33.220* :  speaking to so people are being confronted with just the idea of them more now one expected say
*29:33.220- 29:38.120* :  anyone that runs at what they call a high threat alert system or who may be tired or run down
*29:38.480- 29:43.360* :  they'll be more impacted as a sort of survival instinct if you will kicks in so the part of the
*29:43.360- 29:48.720* :  brain that would light up in response to a real threat will do so as if the thing is actually there
*29:49.320- 29:54.360* :  it's also a very personal experience so if a trigger is a past trauma from a similar experience
*29:54.360- 30:00.940* :  where someone maybe felt fear or disgust or shame that will exacerbate it too what experts have
*30:00.940- 30:05.900* :  said is that trying to stay calm is really the only thing that will lessen that anxiety and maybe
*30:05.900- 30:13.520* :  stop those itchy feelings all I can say is yuck that was Stephanie Prentice there and let's return
*30:13.520- 30:19.580* :  to our main news the fighting in Gaza our international editor Jeremy Bowen has reported on the
*30:19.580- 30:26.080* :  Israeli and Palestinian conflict for decades he's now in Jerusalem covering the current conflict
*30:26.760- 30:32.380* :  here's what he makes of this war four weeks on from the Hamas attack of October 7
*30:33.260- 30:38.300* :  one of the first things to know about the war here is that everyone and I mean everyone is dealing
*30:38.300- 30:44.820* :  with incomplete information but we do know a few things that help to understand a war that could
*30:44.820- 30:51.660* :  be in its early stages and might get much worse one the shock and anger that is powering
*30:51.660- 30:58.980* :  Israel's response to the Hamas attacks of the 7th of October Averamburg now a writer once
*30:58.980- 31:05.500* :  speaker of parliament during the peace process years of the 1990s says Israelis are feeling as
*31:05.500- 31:12.160* :  insecure as they were in the years immediately after the Holocaust we the Jews we believe that the
*31:12.160- 31:19.560* :  state of Israel is the best immune system and protective system versus Jewish history normal
*31:19.560- 31:26.840* :  programs no more Holocaust no more mass murderers and all of the sudden all of it is back so people
*31:26.840- 31:34.040* :  sentimentally and emotionally a back to 45 48 and Palestinians are having flashbacks to their
*31:34.040- 31:40.060* :  own history the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948 destroyed their society in Palestine
*31:40.060- 31:49.060* :  an event Palestinians call the catastrophe al-Nakhba more than 700,000 of them were expelled or fled
*31:49.060- 31:56.140* :  at the hands of Israeli forces a good proportion ended up in refugee camps in Gaza where their
*31:56.140- 32:03.540* :  descendants are sheltering and being killed by Israeli airstrikes Palestinians say Israel is
*32:03.540- 32:10.760* :  trying to create a second Nakhba another point that we do know is that Israelis believe the only
*32:10.760- 32:18.360* :  way to be safe is to destroy Hamas and its junior partner in Gaza islamic jihad in the chaos
*32:18.360- 32:25.840* :  of the 7th of October no amtybona retired Israeli general had a text from his son saying that Hamas

*33:10.900- 33:17.680* :  Gaza today but we have no choices one more absolute certainty Palestinians in Gaza are going
*33:17.980- 33:23.880* :  through hell in many visits over more than 30 years i've always been impressed with the way the
*33:23.880- 33:30.560* :  human spirit flourished in Gaza despite the terrible privations people suffered and what's
*33:30.560- 33:36.340* :  happening now would test anyone to breaking point that's why is a humanitarian worker but she's
