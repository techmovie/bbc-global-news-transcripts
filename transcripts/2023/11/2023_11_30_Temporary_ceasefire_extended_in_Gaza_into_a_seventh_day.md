*01:18.380- 01:25.200* :  I'm Alex Ritson and at 14 hours GMT on Thursday the 30th of November these are our main stories.
*01:25.680- 01:31.700* :  Talks succeed in securing a seventh hostages for prisoners exchange as to Hamas Gunman behind
*01:31.700- 01:37.780* :  an attack on a Jerusalem bus stop a shot dead. The latest UN climate summit has opened in Dubai
*01:37.780- 01:43.540* :  with a call for countries to turn their promises into action but divisions on how to achieve this.
*01:44.140- 01:50.580* :  Former adversaries lead tributes to veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger who's died aged 100.
*01:52.340- 02:00.380* :  Also in this podcast giant pandas at Edinburgh Zoo prepare for a return to China and the end of a
*02:09.480- 02:12.300* :  Christmas fairy tale. Shane McGowan frontman of the pokes has died.
*02:18.040- 02:24.200* :  We start in the Middle East just minutes before the Israel Hamas cease fire in Gaza was due to
*02:24.200- 02:31.960* :  expire at 0500 GMT. The announcement came that it was being extended into a seventh day but there's
*02:31.960- 02:37.400* :  been violence in Jerusalem three people killed at a bus stop. Here's the Israeli President Isaac
*02:37.400- 02:46.020* :  Herzog. Two terrorists have attacked innocent civilians waiting for to be picked up to go on their
*02:46.020- 02:53.500* :  base work and we have casual days we don't have lots of life. Hamas said it carried out the attack.
*02:53.500- 02:59.400* :  Our correspondent Hugo Bashega has been to the scene of the Jerusalem attack and he told me about
*02:59.400- 03:05.600* :  that and the extension of the cease fire. The area had already been open up to traffic to people.
*03:05.600- 03:12.940* :  It's a busy road one of the entrances to Jerusalem. The car of the attackers had already been
*03:12.940- 03:19.780* :  removed and everything was caught on camera. There is CCTV footage which shows the dramatic moment
*03:19.780- 03:30.240* :  this car stops by this crowded bus stop and these two attackers get out of the car and shoot at people
*03:30.240- 03:35.660* :  who were waiting there and this happened at around half past seven in the morning so the morning
*03:35.660- 03:41.760* :  rush hour and we now have the information that three people have been killed. Two attackers have
*03:41.760- 03:48.200* :  also been killed. There were shot dead at the scene and the authorities here are saying that
*03:48.200- 03:55.540* :  there are two Palestinian brothers who were living in a neighborhood in East Jerusalem and Hamas
*03:55.540- 04:00.540* :  has been saying that they were members of the group and this is something that has been
*04:00.540- 04:06.860* :  confirmed by the Israeli security services as well. So this cease fire which has been extended
*04:06.860- 04:11.340* :  for a seventh day doesn't apply to Jerusalem then? No so we're talking about what's happening in
*04:11.340- 04:18.380* :  Gaza with this cease fire so this is a pausing hostilities in Gaza and this extension was
*04:18.380- 04:24.520* :  announced today just 20 minutes before the cease fire was set to expire so again this is proof of
*04:24.520- 04:32.800* :  how difficult how complicated these negotiations have been and today the efforts to extend once again
*04:32.800- 04:40.240* :  this cease fire continues the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was in Tel Aviv he is in
*04:40.720- 04:45.760* :  Ramallah right now he's having talks with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas
*04:46.340- 04:53.180* :  and mediators Egyptian mediators Katari mediators are again trying to reach a deal to not only
*04:53.460- 05:02.240* :  extend this cease fire but also to allow more aid into Gaza much needed aid into Gaza as this
*05:02.240- 05:08.180* :  humanitarian crisis continues so there'll be another hostages for prisoners exchange later then
*05:09.240- 05:15.560* :  so more hostages are expected to be released later and I think we are expecting again to see
*05:15.560- 05:23.120* :  another group of Palestinians being released from Israeli jails and and I think the expectation here
*05:23.840- 05:30.000* :  some sort of announcement could come later today about another possible extension the Israelis
*05:30.000- 05:37.000* :  have been saying that they are open to an extension of one day in this pause in hostilities in Gaza
*05:37.480- 05:43.680* :  if Hamas releases 10 more hostages so essentially they're saying that Hamas needs to come up with a
*05:43.680- 05:49.980* :  list of of 10 names of people to be released for this cease fire to continue I think the Egyptians
*05:49.980- 05:55.820* :  the Kataris are pushing for a two-day extension right now so it will be interesting to see whether
*05:56.100- 06:00.900* :  they will be able to achieve this further extension of the cease fire in Gaza.
*06:01.420- 06:09.160* :  Hugo Bachega in Jerusalem Thailand is celebrating the return to Bangkok of 17 of its nationals that
*06:09.160- 06:15.940* :  were held captive by Hamas for almost 50 years the extension of the truce between Israel and Hamas
*06:15.940- 06:21.900* :  that is so far seen 70 Israeli women and children freed has renewed hope for the release of nine
*06:21.900- 06:28.440* :  Thai nationals still being held by Hamas our correspondent Shima Khalil was at the airport in Bangkok
*06:28.440- 06:33.980* :  where there were jubilant scenes and she's been speaking to some of the families I can just tell
*06:33.980- 06:38.420* :  you that some of them were left speechless there were tears and there were smiles and
*06:39.420- 06:43.820* :  they were they were just in disbelief because you know over the past few days we've been speaking
*06:43.820- 06:47.460* :  to family members who told us that they didn't know if their loved ones were alive or dead
*06:48.040- 06:52.160* :  and that some of them knew that they were okay only when new footage of the release
*06:52.940- 06:59.840* :  was on the news and they watched them on TV today 17 of those 23 released hostages touched
*06:59.840- 07:04.800* :  down on home soil after nearly two months in captivity and you could see how shell shocked
*07:05.280- 07:12.060* :  they were one of them his nickname is Moo stepped out saw his dad outside the airport terminal
*07:12.060- 07:18.480* :  ran to him and knelt in front of his dad and that moment when they were both in tears hugging each
*07:18.480- 07:23.720* :  other and his dad had earlier told us that he just didn't think this moment would happen Shima
*07:23.720- 07:29.120* :  there are still a few more Thai nationals in captivity and Gaza that haven't been released yet
*07:29.120- 07:35.700* :  do we know why that's right nine of them and I think the reason is that this diplomatic route that
*07:35.700- 07:41.520* :  Thailand has been going which has reached them a separate if parallel deal to to release their
*07:41.520- 07:46.120* :  nationals was based on the fact that they were going to be released in groups they're hoping
*07:46.120- 07:51.420* :  that the the remaining nine will be released as this truth continues to be extended you were
*07:51.420- 07:56.940* :  speaking to Hugo earlier about the extension of the truth the the hope is is that with this extension
*07:56.940- 08:02.260* :  and hopefully the continuation of that those nine will be released but I think there is a huge
*08:02.260- 08:09.200* :  sigh of relief in Thailand as those 17 touched down for the first time after the or or deal on the
*08:09.200- 08:15.600* :  October the 7th Shima Khalil in Bangkok world leaders are discussing how to tackle climate
*08:15.600- 08:21.560* :  change at a UN summit that's opened into by COP28 comes after a year of extreme weather events
*08:21.560- 08:28.880* :  in which many climate records have been broken COP28 president Sultan Ahmed Al Jabbur opened the
*08:28.880- 08:37.820* :  event I ask you to adopt a different way of thinking and I ask you to be flexible
*08:40.040- 08:48.600* :  we must ensure that this COP delivers the most ambitious global stocktake possible
*08:51.060- 09:00.100* :  so let's work efficiently let's agree on the agenda and move to text quickly please
*09:01.060- 09:07.240* :  our environment correspondent Matt McGraw is at the summit so I think expectations are probably
*09:07.240- 09:12.200* :  on the slightly higher side than they have been at past events there's around a hundred thousand
*09:12.200- 09:17.160* :  people registered for this particular meeting that's four times the number of people that were
*09:17.160- 09:23.080* :  registered for the COP26 event in Glasgow a couple years ago I think a lot of people here are
*09:23.080- 09:28.800* :  expecting that there will see significant progress on the potential phase down or phase out of
*09:28.800- 09:34.160* :  fossil fuels I think that's the top item on the agenda whether that will happen or not though
*09:34.160- 09:38.900* :  of course is we'll unfold over the next couple of weeks but I think we will see a lot of progress
*09:38.900- 09:45.340* :  on other what might be the terms side deals on issues like methane on whether or not there's
*09:45.340- 09:50.320* :  enough funding for climate damages loss and damages it's called here Matt the locations
*09:50.320- 09:55.240* :  controversial isn't it the United Arab Emirates one of the world's largest exporters of oil and gas
*09:55.640- 10:00.600* :  yes indeed I think there is some controversy around the choice of the UAE as the host
*10:00.840- 10:06.360* :  this year I think there's been some questions about whether an oil producing nation is the
*10:06.360- 10:12.360* :  right person to try and phase out the use of oil and other fossil fuels supporters of the UAE say
*10:12.360- 10:16.480* :  they're the best place they have large amounts of money they have good will amongst many
*10:16.480- 10:22.400* :  countries and those factors may actually be critical when it comes down to the final days or
*10:22.400- 10:27.180* :  final hours and negotiations here in trying to get some agreement but I do agree that it is
*10:27.440- 10:32.180* :  somewhat ironic that the world is turning to the UAE at this moment to try and lead that phase
*10:32.180- 10:37.760* :  out from fossil fuels and the Lord's Father ever shadowed by those leaked documents seen by the BBC
*10:37.760- 10:43.460* :  which appeared to show that Dubai had been using its role as host as an opportunity to actually
*10:43.460- 10:50.080* :  strike new oil and gas deals yeah I think the focus here right now is on moving forward towards a
*10:50.080- 10:54.700* :  bigger deal about the end of fossil fuels I think that's really where the focus has been there's
*10:54.700- 10:58.840* :  been some criticism as a set of the United Arab Emirates but I think you know most people here
*10:58.840- 11:03.600* :  are pragmatic they don't think there's any likelihood of a change in leadership at this moment
*11:03.600- 11:07.960* :  in time and they think that you know they've expressed their support for the president and they
*11:07.960- 11:12.240* :  want to see what will happen in the next couple of weeks as the negotiations really start
*11:13.220- 11:20.100* :  Matt McGraw Indian actress dear Mirza has starred in dozens of films over the last 20 years
*11:20.100- 11:26.300* :  but away from the Bollywood glamour she's also a committed climate campaigner Mirza has just
*11:26.300- 11:32.520* :  been named one of this year's BBC 100 women and she's been speaking to Van Dan of EJ about why
*11:32.520- 11:40.640* :  she's so passionate about climate change it's so important to walk the dock how can I advocate
*11:41.260- 11:48.460* :  for sustainable living if I don't practice it myself what right would I have to tell young people
*11:49.300- 11:56.200* :  that our habits need to change our consumption patterns our real living has to change in order to
*11:56.260- 12:04.000* :  bring the shift that is required plastic became excruciating the apparent and visible to me
*12:04.000- 12:11.160* :  when I was doing a show from Gango 3 to Ganga Sagar when I traveled to the river and I just saw
*12:11.160- 12:16.360* :  ravines of plastic waste and recognize the fact that we didn't have the infrastructure
*12:17.320- 12:24.900* :  or the amenities to manage or collect that waste and it would eventually just either be burnt
*12:25.640- 12:31.900* :  or end up in the sea it was then when I decided that I would never drink water out of a plastic bottle
*12:31.900- 12:38.920* :  again that I would make sure that I'd never have to use single use cutlery or a plate or anything
*12:38.920- 12:46.120* :  outside the house or in the house that all our celebrations would be absolutely sustainable that
*12:46.120- 12:52.560* :  we would make the most responsible choices whether it was in the food we were serving or how we
*12:52.560- 12:58.020* :  were serving the food or what kind of deco we were using BBC 100 women this year is focusing on
*12:58.020- 13:05.240* :  climate change and also shedding a spotlight on women who are working on tackling these issues
*13:06.240- 13:12.580* :  what do you think are the biggest climate issues of today I think the biggest climate issue is
*13:13.380- 13:21.140* :  a bunch of ecotistical men who refuse to change there was a time when
*13:21.340- 13:30.880* :  they were climate deniers but now the polluters know irrevocably what their choices are doing
*13:31.660- 13:38.360* :  they're killing our planet and our people dear mirrors are one of this year's BBC 100 women
*13:39.620- 13:45.840* :  in what's being built as a momentous landmark for medical science the UK biobank project is
*13:45.840- 13:53.000* :  releasing the full genetic codes of all its half a million participants it's a massive data dump
*13:53.000- 13:58.520* :  of information that researchers hope will turbocharge the discovery of new diagnostics treatments
*13:58.520- 14:05.160* :  and cures and uniquely is available to scientists worldwide via a protected anonymized
*14:05.160- 14:10.260* :  database of the national health service in England Tom Fielden reports
*14:15.800- 14:18.920* :  as hard and as long as you possibly come
*14:21.020- 14:27.540* :  March 2006 and retired truck driver Keith Kingsbury is one of the first volunteers to be put through
*14:27.540- 14:34.360* :  his paces at the UK Biobank Assessment Centre at Altringham and Cheshire the results of Keith's
*14:34.360- 14:40.180* :  lung capacity test along with a range of physical measurements and biological samples information
*14:40.180- 14:46.780* :  about his lifestyle and crucially his anonymized NHS health records have contributed to one of
*14:46.780- 14:52.840* :  the most comprehensive and widely used biomedical data sets anywhere in the world
*14:54.400- 15:00.260* :  when UK biobank was set up the idea that you could sequence half a million people was a fantasy
*15:00.480- 15:06.940* :  and now researchers have gone back to those original samples to sequence the entire genetic code
*15:07.240- 15:13.360* :  of all 500,000 participants couldn't be done then it can be done now and it has been
*15:13.360- 15:18.800* :  the CEO and principal investigator at UK Biobank is Professor Sorori Collins
*15:19.000- 15:25.780* :  what's so special about UK Biobank is a unique combination of scale depth of information and
*15:25.780- 15:31.560* :  duration and the addition of sequence data I think it's going to turbocharge the discoveries
*15:31.560- 15:39.320* :  that come out of UK Biobank so we've got advice that was sent out to 100,000 UK Biobank participants
*15:39.560- 15:45.640* :  one of those hoping this massive genetic data drop and turbocharge his discoveries is the
*15:45.640- 15:50.520* :  professor of bioinformatics at Oxford University's big data institute Aiden Dock.
*15:50.520- 15:54.300* :  This is not quite as sophisticated as an Apple Watch or a Fitbit is it?
*15:54.300- 15:59.960* :  Although for our purposes more useful Professor Dockety is trying to unpick the complex
*15:59.960- 16:06.640* :  interrelationship between exercise, sleep and disease and it turns out our genetic makeup
*16:06.640- 16:12.340* :  is an important factor in why some people are naturally more active or sleep better.
*16:12.700- 16:18.220* :  I'm hugely excited about this new release of data because we're really turning up the dial
*16:18.220- 16:24.700* :  in the microscope and can be find some new genetic causes of why some people are more active
*16:24.920- 16:32.620* :  or why some people are sleeping better. Please breathe in, breathe out and hold your breath.
*16:32.880- 16:38.980* :  The addition of whole genome sequencing has the potential to transform the hunt for new diagnostics
*16:38.980- 16:46.220* :  treatment some cures but the real power behind the UK Biobank comes from the elbow grease many of
*16:46.220- 16:53.180* :  its 500,000 participants are still bringing to the process 15 years after it was launched.
*16:53.220- 17:00.440* :  Well I'm here for a series of scans which are going to help I hope advance medical treatment.
*17:00.440- 17:06.860* :  I know it requires flogging down to reading and spending half a day here but if it's worth
*17:06.860- 17:12.100* :  doing why not do it? I think you know everybody ought to really do what they can and the help of
*17:12.100- 17:17.760* :  young old you are it just helps. Please, breathe in, breathe in.
*17:20.260- 17:27.020* :  Tom Fildon with that report. Visitors to Edinburgh Zoo here in the UK will get their last
*17:27.020- 17:34.020* :  chance to see the only giant pandas in Britain later today. The pair called Yang Guan
*17:34.020- 17:41.200* :  and Tian Tian arrived in Scotland in 2011 Darren McGarry from Edinburgh Zoo says people from all
*17:41.200- 17:46.720* :  over the world watch the panda cam set up in the enclosure. People watch it 24 hours a day.
*17:46.840- 17:51.380* :  We get phone calls to say you know Yang Guan's not moved today is they all right I've not seen
*17:51.380- 17:54.860* :  the keepers going in feed him at that time and as I say that's great you know we've never
*17:54.860- 17:59.280* :  ever minded that we know that pandas are special. I absolutely think there will be lots of tears
*17:59.580- 18:03.680* :  and for people when they last see them and I can't guarantee that there won't be tears from some
*18:03.680- 18:08.640* :  of my keepers when they wave them goodbye at the airport as well. The pair are due to return to
*18:08.640- 18:14.380* :  China next month and public access to the pandas will be restricted from Friday as they prepare
*18:14.380- 18:21.300* :  for the journey as our Scotland correspondent Shionne McCallum reports. Crowds lined the streets to see
*18:21.300- 18:27.720* :  Yang Guan and Tian Tian also known as Sunshine and Sweetie arrived in Scotland in December 2011
*18:27.720- 18:33.620* :  but now Edinburgh Zoo's star attractions are preparing for their flight home to Chengdu.
*18:34.120- 18:39.300* :  During their time in the UK researchers have monitored the bears as part of international efforts
*18:39.300- 18:45.000* :  to protect the species but hopes for cubs were dashed when both natural and artificial
*18:45.000- 18:51.260* :  insemination breeding attempts were unsuccessful. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland says it
*18:51.260- 18:55.920* :  feels it's the right time for the animals to return to China. Shionne McCallum
*18:58.880- 19:06.220* :  Coming up in this podcast we hear how Twitter or ex-owner Elon Musk tries out a new persuasion
*19:06.220- 19:11.500* :  technique with advertisers who've left since his takeover. If somebody could try black
*19:11.500- 19:14.900* :  me only with advertising, black me only with money, go f*** yourself.
*19:25.080- 19:30.220* :  Tributes have been pouring in for the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who's
*19:30.220- 19:35.840* :  died at the age of a hundred. Leading the Tributes former president George W. Bush called Kissinger
*19:35.840- 19:41.720* :  who served under presidents Nixon and Ford, one of the most dependable and distinctive voices on
*19:41.720- 19:47.300* :  foreign affairs. Nixon's daughters said he was one of America's most skilled diplomats.
*19:47.580- 19:53.180* :  Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he made significant contributions to promoting peace
*19:53.180- 19:59.640* :  and stability in Asia while China called him an old friend. The present US Secretary of State
*19:59.640- 20:03.120* :  Antony Blinken paid this tribute to his predecessor.
*20:03.820- 20:09.220* :  Secretary Kissinger really set the standard for everyone who followed in this job. I was very
*20:09.220- 20:15.900* :  privileged to get his counsel many times including his recently about a month ago. He was extraordinarily
*20:15.900- 20:21.800* :  generous with his wisdom, with his advice. Few people were better students of history,
*20:22.640- 20:26.340* :  even fewer people did more to shape history than Henry Kissinger.
*20:27.040- 20:33.280* :  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 for his
*20:33.280- 20:38.360* :  efforts to end the Vietnam War, but some accused him of war crimes for his involvement
*20:38.360- 20:43.720* :  in the US bombing of Cambodia, which killed hundreds of thousands there. Our diplomatic
*20:43.720- 20:49.360* :  correspondent James Landel looks back at his life. Henry Kissinger was one of the cold war's most
*20:49.360- 20:55.600* :  influential statesmen, the sweep of his life immense. As a child he fled Nazi Germany with his
*20:55.600- 21:00.380* :  Jewish family, but he returned to Europe to fight with the US Army, helping to liberate concentration
*21:00.380- 21:06.480* :  camps. As a young scholar he made his name arguing nuclear weapons could be used in conventional
*21:06.480- 21:10.840* :  wars. He entered government with President Nixon first as a national security advisor,
*21:10.840- 21:16.360* :  then Secretary of State. And his big idea was to try to avoid global conflict by balancing
*21:16.360- 21:23.260* :  competing powers with national self-interest, trumping human rights or shared values. Its name
*21:23.260- 21:31.500* :  was Real Politik. No nation can make its survival dependent on the goodwill of another state,
*21:31.500- 21:37.700* :  especially of a state that announces a hostile ideology. So he led America's re-engagement
*21:37.700- 21:42.280* :  with Communist China and sought to date ont with the Soviet Union through arms control.
*21:42.660- 21:46.780* :  His tireless efforts to find peace in them at least coined the phrase shuttle diplomacy,
*21:46.800- 21:50.660* :  and all this brought him global celebrity, something he relished.
*21:50.960- 21:54.540* :  I don't stand on protocol if you'll just call me Excellency, we'll be getting
*21:56.060- 22:01.380* :  He became an unlikely sex symbol and popularized the phrase power is the ultimate
*22:01.380- 22:04.680* :  Afridiziac, his vanity mocked by multi-pifers.
*22:15.540- 22:20.700* :  But this fame became notoriety over his handling of the Vietnam War, especially the bombing
*22:20.700- 22:26.880* :  of Cambodia which killed hundreds of thousands, leading some to accuse him of being a war criminal.
*22:27.260- 22:31.200* :  He was also criticized for supporting anti-communist authoritarian leaders,
*22:31.520- 22:36.300* :  most controversially, he backed the coup which brought General Pinochet's brutal junta
*22:36.300- 22:41.480* :  to power in Chile, something he later defended. It was at the height of the Cold War so that
*22:41.480- 22:47.180* :  the United States could not be totally indifferent to the question of a communist regime in Chile.
*22:47.460- 22:52.640* :  Dr Kissinger was considered so indispensable, he survived the Watergate crisis and was kept on
*22:52.640- 22:57.160* :  by Nixon's successor Gerald Ford. But in time he fell out of favor in Washington,
*22:57.160- 23:02.140* :  loathed by the left, distrusted by the right and began a life of lucrative consultancy,
*23:02.420- 23:06.520* :  his counsel valued as much in the Oval Office as in the commercial boardroom.
*23:26.820- 23:32.400* :  Seven decades has extraordinary lasting impact. In terms of his government service,
*23:32.980- 23:39.880* :  I think he transformed American policy. He blended the European sense of tragedy and the American
*23:39.880- 23:46.840* :  immigrant sense of hope, a dash of realism, a dash of idealism. But more concretely, you have
*23:46.840- 23:52.920* :  to remember what he inherited and what Nixon inherited in 1969. We were bogged down in the Vietnam
*23:52.920- 23:59.280* :  war, we had riots, assassinations, a president who resigned, no contact with one quarter of the
*23:59.280- 24:06.240* :  world's people, tense nuclear standoff with the Soviets, a tough war in Vietnam, declining
*24:06.240- 24:13.340* :  influence in the Middle East, and succeeding years all of that was changed. And so that was an
*24:13.340- 24:19.980* :  incredible transformation. Then through his books, his commentary, his counseling of world and
*24:19.980- 24:26.640* :  American leaders, he maintained his influence for another several decades. So I think he is one
*24:26.640- 24:34.520* :  of the most towering American public figures in the last 50 to 75 years. Let me put to one of
*24:34.520- 24:40.900* :  these strands of criticism that his many detractors have given voice to, even in the past few
*24:40.900- 24:46.620* :  hours, which is that the bombing of, for instance, Cambodia, the support for Pakistan's efforts in
*24:46.620- 24:51.380* :  East Pakistan, what is now Bangladesh, or if you look at what happened in East Timor,
*24:51.820- 24:56.980* :  was not only morally debased in their view, because it led to the death of many people who didn't
*24:56.980- 25:03.080* :  need to die, but it was also ultimately diplomatically unnecessary. It wasn't a necessary part
*25:03.720- 25:08.520* :  of America's strategy. What would you say to those two criticisms, the moral and the
*25:08.520- 25:13.540* :  diplomatic criticism? It's hard in the time we have to go for each of the instances you say,
*25:13.720- 25:18.880* :  I'm not going to pretend that he used human rights as a whole providing beacon. He had to balance
*25:18.880- 25:23.480* :  off geopolitical and other objectives with various countries, and sometimes you have to work
*25:23.480- 25:29.060* :  with unsavvy regimes. And finally, what was he like as a man and as a boss? You worked with
*25:29.060- 25:34.900* :  him very intimately, very closely through those extraordinary occasions and meetings. What was he
*25:34.900- 25:40.720* :  like? Well, he was my foremost mentor. He had more influence than me than anybody outside my
*25:40.720- 25:46.380* :  family. He was also a tormentor in the sense that he was very demanding. He would drive
*25:46.380- 25:51.360* :  your nuts, and he would stretch my patience and my nerves, but he also stretched my capabilities
*25:52.260- 26:00.420* :  and stretched my horizons. And so he was a very tough boss, but he was tough on himself
*26:00.420- 26:05.380* :  than anyone else, and by demanding excellence, he got excellence out of me and many others.
*26:06.320- 26:13.140* :  Winston-Lord, former US ambassador to China. Let's turn to coverage of another ongoing conflict,
*26:13.140- 26:18.640* :  the Civil War in Sudan, the Army, and the paramilitary rapid support forces have been fighting
*26:18.640- 26:24.520* :  each other for control of Sudan since April, displacing more than six million people. It's hard
*26:24.520- 26:30.800* :  to comprehend such a large number of people, so let's focus on just one. His name is Mohammed
*26:30.800- 26:36.900* :  Fadoul or Moe. He's been in touch with the BBC, and has been sharing daily diaries of his life
*26:36.900- 26:42.720* :  since the start of the war seven months ago. Victoria Uwan Kunda has been speaking to him about
*26:42.720- 26:50.800* :  how he's coping. Every day life nowadays is better in terms of the fighting. The fighting is almost
*26:50.800- 26:55.540* :  I mean, you can hear gunshots now in the background, but it's not as bad as it used to be before.
*26:56.580- 27:02.880* :  In terms of food, water, it's there. It's basically mainly local stuff. We don't have any more
*27:02.880- 27:08.580* :  supermarkets and we can go and get the normal stuff, but we're still here surviving basically.
*27:08.960- 27:14.780* :  Surviving. Moe, you just said that it's getting better, but then you mentioned the sound of gunshots
*27:14.780- 27:22.500* :  that you can hear as we speak, for the global audience who cannot imagine what regular gunfire
*27:22.500- 27:29.140* :  sounds like, and you're saying it's better. Can you remind our listeners of where you've been
*27:29.540- 27:34.520* :  for you to be able to say, well, even with these gunshots, it's still better than what we had before?
*27:35.200- 27:39.340* :  These are just isolated gunshots here and there. What I really meant was the fighting,
*27:39.340- 27:45.960* :  the heavy fighting that was going on the first, let's say, two or three months of this conflict.
*27:46.760- 27:50.820* :  What you hear now is just like I said, isolated gunshots here and there. Probably
*27:50.820- 27:56.840* :  somebody who's found a gun somewhere firing bullets in the air, but it's not real fighting going on.
*27:57.100- 28:02.640* :  Is it a normal occurrence that people find guns thrown around and they just pick them up?
*28:02.740- 28:08.760* :  Oh yes, left over by the army or by the other group, but in Cartoon itself, the only areas that
*28:08.760- 28:14.800* :  have fighting are the areas where the army is still holding on. But we've got used to it now,
*28:14.800- 28:19.840* :  all the gunshots and what have you? What are the kids up to every day? What is life life for them?
*28:20.420- 28:26.840* :  Well, Faris is five and she has, just under two, is this your call? I mean, we've survived
*28:26.840- 28:32.520* :  an earthquake on the 12th of October. A house next door was hit directly by a fire fighter jet.
*28:33.420- 28:40.300* :  And only God knows how we survived that, but thank God anyway, not a nice situation to be in, to be honest.
*28:41.080- 28:47.740* :  Mo, a resident of Khartoum, Sudan. Elon Musk has warned that his social media platform
*28:47.740- 28:53.240* :  X, formerly known as Twitter, could go under if an advertising boycott continues.
*28:53.240- 28:59.120* :  A number of high-profile companies, including Disney, have stopped posting on X after Mr. Musk
*28:59.120- 29:04.480* :  shared a tweet considered by some to be anti-Semitic. He's since apologized, but in an
*29:04.480- 29:10.760* :  expletive laden outburst at an event in New York last night, he accused the companies of blackmail,
*29:10.960- 29:14.040* :  more from our North America technology reporter James Clayton.
*29:14.740- 29:20.040* :  Even for Elon Musk, this outburst was unexpected. He's in theory trying to woo advertisers
*29:20.040- 29:25.940* :  back to X, many of whom have pulled their ads from the platform worried about anti-Semitic content.
*29:25.940- 29:31.840* :  However, using a choiceful letter word, he suggested advertisers that had left X
*29:32.140- 29:33.760* :  could take their business elsewhere.
*29:34.180- 29:38.860* :  You don't want them to advertise? No. What do you mean? If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with
*29:38.860- 29:44.620* :  advertising, blackmail me with money, go f*** yourself. He also accepted that if advertisers
*29:44.620- 29:50.700* :  didn't return, the lack of revenue could kill the business. Though he apologized for an earlier
*29:50.700- 29:56.160* :  post in which he circulated an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, it's hard to see how this fighting
*29:56.160- 30:02.760* :  talk is going to smooth relations. And without advertising money, the company is in a dire financial
*30:02.980- 30:12.940* :  position. James Clayton. The Irish singer-songwriter Shane McGowan has died. He was 65. Last December,
*30:12.940- 30:18.200* :  he was hospitalized with viral encephalitis and spent several months this year in hospital
*30:18.200- 30:24.380* :  in intensive care. As the frontman of the pokes, Shane McGowan introduced his own brand of Irish
*30:24.380- 30:30.500* :  folk to a new generation in Britain. His wife, Victoria Mary Clark said, Shane will always be the
*30:30.500- 30:36.700* :  light I hold before me and the measure of my dreams and the love of my life. Colin Patterson looks
*30:43.760- 30:49.040* :  back on his life. With his stumpy teeth, slurred speech, glass in one hand, cigarette in the other,
*30:49.040- 30:54.700* :  the pokes lead singer Shane McGowan became one of Ireland's most famous musical exports. Except,
*30:54.700- 31:00.800* :  he was actually born in Kent and attended London's Westminster School, the alma mater of six
*31:00.800- 31:06.680* :  Prime Ministers. Not the most obvious background for one of the music scenes most notorious hellraisers.
*31:10.100- 31:15.760* :  Punk inspired him to become a musician, but he found success after forming the pokes and combining
*31:15.760- 31:22.400* :  a raw folk sound with his poetic lyrics, often documenting the life of Irish immigrants in London.
*31:28.940- 31:34.500* :  Shane McGowan was kicked out of the pokes in 1991. His drinking had reached levels that affected
*31:34.500- 31:40.980* :  his ability to perform or even turn up. He was replaced by his childhood hero Joe Strummer off
*31:40.980- 31:45.800* :  the clash before rejoining a decade later for a series of union tours.
*31:50.360- 31:54.940* :  The song for which he'll best be remembered is one which has returned to the top 20 in December
*31:54.940- 32:02.020* :  every year since 2006. Fairytale of New York with Kirsty McCall was first released in 1987.
*32:02.020- 32:07.360* :  The result of a bet with Elvis Costello who said the pokes couldn't write a Christmas hit,
*32:07.360- 32:13.400* :  a challenge taken up by Shane McGowan who was actually born on Christmas Day 1957.
*32:24.840- 32:27.500* :  Colin Patterson looking back at the life of Shane McGowan.
