*01:50.360- 01:55.660* :  Mike Phillips never finished high school in the 1960s. With the help of his girlfriend Mary Jane,
*01:55.660- 02:03.500* :  he's just attended his graduation at the age of 77. That was probably the best surprise I ever got in my life.
*02:03.820- 02:11.220* :  But on the way there, he says, now I don't want any surprises. Make sure there are no surprises and I thought,
*02:11.260- 02:13.200* :  oh brother, boy, I'm in trouble.
*02:18.160- 02:23.960* :  Hello, I'm Harry Bly and in this edition of The Happy Pot, meet Nicola from England. She makes pottery
*02:23.960- 02:29.980* :  for people with disabilities. It just seems to have been that people don't want a medical aid,
*02:29.980- 02:34.640* :  they just want to sit and continue to enjoy drinking their cook up.
*02:34.860- 02:41.460* :  Her work went viral online and now she's helping hundreds. A DT Gupta wrote a comic book in 2014
*02:41.500- 02:46.540* :  to teach girls about periods. Now, Men's Jupidia is used all over the world.
*02:47.340- 02:53.800* :  And we hear the impressive clean energy record set by Portugal. All that and more to come on the
*02:53.800- 02:58.600* :  Happy Pot. And I'm on the chat with the little happy pot.
*02:59.240- 03:07.320* :  Todd, POD. You got me. Hello, this is Mike Phillips. Then I'm listening to the happy
*03:07.320- 03:10.800* :  pod. Lovely. And now from Dickerson, Texas.
*03:11.460- 03:15.020* :  That's right, this is The Happy Pot from the BBC World Service.
*03:21.820- 03:27.100* :  Let's begin in Texas in the town of Dickinson. George Michael Phillips or Mike, as he's known,
*03:27.100- 03:33.520* :  is 77 years old. He left Dickinson High School in the 1960s at the age of just 17,
*03:33.520- 03:39.760* :  to enlist in the US Navy where he went on to serve in Vietnam. He had a successful career,
*03:39.760- 03:45.400* :  but there was always one regret he hadn't graduated from high school. His old friend,
*03:45.400- 03:51.100* :  now girlfriend, Mary Jane Music, who later became a teacher at the school, made it her mission
*03:51.100- 03:58.940* :  to fix this. She found Texas Education Code 28-0251, which allows school districts to issue
*03:58.940- 04:04.620* :  diplomas, to military veterans, and she hatched a plan. I've been speaking to both Mike and
*04:04.620- 04:12.140* :  Mary Jane. She began by telling me how they met up again after 60 years. We went to a mutual
*04:12.940- 04:18.800* :  classmate, high school classmates funeral, and realized that we were high school classmates,
*04:19.760- 04:27.340* :  and I asked him if he ever played, put, put golf. And he said, yes. So I said, well, we need to
*04:27.340- 04:33.400* :  go sometimes. And we did. So we've been dating for about five and a half months.
*04:34.180- 04:40.160* :  Wow. And you were both at high school classmates in the 60s. Can you first tell us a story about
*04:40.160- 04:46.660* :  why you didn't graduate? Well, Vietnam was just going on in and I said, well, I just need to
*04:46.960- 04:53.120* :  join the Navy and go see what I can do. So I ended up quitting school and went to the Navy and
*04:54.100- 05:02.800* :  ended up on a 36-foot wooden boat going up down the river and Vietnam. And Mary, 60 years later,
*05:02.800- 05:09.040* :  you're the reason that this came together that Mike graduated at the age of 77 with a high school
*05:09.040- 05:16.780* :  diploma. Can you tell me about that story? Well, he would tell me my biggest regret is that I didn't
*05:16.780- 05:23.740* :  graduate from high school. He got his GED from the Navy. When he got out of the Navy,
*05:23.740- 05:30.500* :  he worked on a police officer certification. And he would say, but yet, my biggest regret is that
*05:30.500- 05:36.280* :  I didn't get a high school diploma. And that just really bothered me because he was so accomplished
*05:36.280- 05:42.800* :  in so many areas of his life. It just didn't make sense that he didn't have this high school diploma.
*05:43.500- 05:50.220* :  So I decided to get online and look, and I found an application for veterans who did not complete
*05:50.220- 05:57.720* :  their high school diploma to be able to apply for it and receive it. And so I wrote a letter to
*05:57.720- 06:05.800* :  our school district and it all came to fruition. And you went back to Dickinson High School to receive
*06:05.800- 06:10.020* :  your diploma. And it was quite a so many, wasn't it, Mike? Can you tell me about that?
*06:10.020- 06:18.580* :  Yeah. Well, first off, I was got there under the impression that the school board was recognizing
*06:18.780- 06:25.140* :  some of the veterans that went to school there just as her veterans day, my diploma that was all
*06:25.140- 06:30.920* :  kept secret. I didn't know any of it. As ladies and superintendents, she stood up and she asked
*06:30.920- 06:36.940* :  the veterans to stand. And there was about five or six of us there. And then she started talking
*06:36.940- 06:42.560* :  and we all sat down. And the next thing you know, she keeps talking and I'm looking, she's talking
*06:42.560- 06:50.020* :  about me. And the next thing you know, she's calling me up and she's handing me my high school diploma.
*06:50.020- 06:56.640* :  And then I got the cap and gown. They had the students there from the high school band that
*06:56.640- 07:03.620* :  played the pop and circumstance. Pop and circumstance for it. And after I done that,
*07:03.940- 07:08.640* :  because one thing she asked me, she said, was you crying? And I said, I made out of been crying,
*07:08.640- 07:14.800* :  but I had big old tears rolling down my eye. That was probably the best surprise I ever got in my
*07:14.800- 07:22.120* :  life. But on the way there, he says, now, I don't want any surprises. Make sure there are no surprises.
*07:22.120- 07:28.620* :  And I thought, Oh, brother, boy, my in trouble. I think one thing that Mary Jane said like,
*07:28.620- 07:35.040* :  this proves is you don't ever get too old to accomplish something to me as a great feeling.
*07:36.060- 07:41.800* :  And Mike, what would you say to someone who perhaps is in your position who also served
*07:42.320- 07:48.540* :  in Vietnam or perhaps another war who wants to do the same? What would be your advice to them?
*07:49.380- 07:55.740* :  Go for it. You know, if you can get that and you like say, if you want that diploma or whatever
*07:55.740- 08:00.920* :  you want, just go for it. Don't, you know, don't say that's, you know, it's a pass and you can't
*08:00.920- 08:09.340* :  get it done because Mary Jane showed that it can be done. We honestly are hoping that young high
*08:09.340- 08:16.700* :  school students will say, gee, I can accomplish this as well because sometimes it gets tough times
*08:16.700- 08:27.580* :  or hard. It can be done. We want Mike to be looked at as a model for getting that high school diploma
*08:27.580- 08:35.440* :  that it's never too late. Dickinson High School Class of 1965, 2023 graduate, Mike Phillips,
*08:35.440- 08:42.180* :  and the woman who made that possible, Mary Jane Music. We have talked about coral reefs a few times
*08:42.180- 08:47.040* :  on this podcast. We've heard from scientists around the world who are coming up with innovative ways
*08:47.040- 08:52.920* :  to protect corals from the threats posed by climate change. In July, we spoke to the Australian
*08:52.920- 08:59.380* :  marine biologist Tim Lamont, who introduced us to the array of sounds you can hear on a healthy coral reef.
*09:04.580- 09:09.580* :  When we listen with a special underwater microphone, we hear all sorts of weird and wonderful noises
*09:09.580- 09:14.760* :  on a healthy reef. So first you'll hear this sort of background crackle. It sounds a bit like
*09:14.760- 09:21.840* :  radio static or like bacon frying in a pan. And what it is is it's the sound of thousands of
*09:21.840- 09:29.980* :  snapping shrimp all clicking their claws. Some fish make sort of chattering sounds. Others make
*09:30.040- 09:40.680* :  whipping sounds. Others buzz or grunt or hum or bellow. There are so many sounds that we're
*09:40.680- 09:47.800* :  struggling to come up with words to describe them sometimes. Tim and his team found that playing
*09:47.800- 09:53.360* :  these sounds to dead coral reefs entices back fish and the nutrients they bring with them.
*09:54.180- 10:00.020* :  Today's story is across the South Pacific Ocean off the coast of Ecuador. A team of scientists
*10:00.020- 10:06.560* :  have identified two enormous and healthy cold water reefs located far deeper than the ones we
*10:06.560- 10:12.400* :  usually hear about. These reefs were found in the waters surrounding the Galapagos Islands known
*10:12.400- 10:18.760* :  for their vast and unique range of wildlife. These reefs were spotted and investigated by an underwater
*10:18.760- 10:27.040* :  remotely operated vehicle or ROV named Sebastian. I spoke to the expedition's chief scientist Kathleen
*10:27.100- 10:37.640* :  Robert. So the ROV is a very big robot. It has these two robotic arms and a camera in the middle.
*10:38.120- 10:43.740* :  And then we are at the surface of the vessel in a machine control room where we have two or three
*10:43.740- 10:50.200* :  RV pilots. So one person that will fly the ROV so control the truck thrusters and then one other
*10:50.200- 10:56.660* :  person that will control the arms when we actually need to sample because we often cannot tell what
*10:56.660- 11:03.120* :  the exact species of an animal is just by the video. So we need to have a sample of that species so
*11:03.120- 11:09.520* :  we can look under the microscope as well as take genetic samples. Wow. And so the ROV goes down
*11:09.520- 11:15.400* :  to the bottom and it found these deep water coral. Describe that moment for me when you discovered
*11:15.400- 11:21.100* :  them. What was that like? It's always quite exciting. We start seeing a few isolated patches.
*11:21.920- 11:27.660* :  They're orange and they grow a little bit like a bush and they're quite beautiful and there's
*11:27.660- 11:33.720* :  quite a few other species that tends to live on them. And so usually we end up seeing a few patches
*11:33.720- 11:41.000* :  on boulders as we get to the right depth which is around 400 meters. We'd start to see a few colonies
*11:41.000- 11:48.800* :  and as we would go up and we start seeing more and more and around 350 meters then the whole sea floor
*11:48.800- 11:55.340* :  was covered with these corals. It's very much like walking in the understory of a forest.
*11:55.340- 12:01.340* :  So all the bushes would be your corals and then as you zoom in to there you'd see all the different
*12:01.340- 12:08.520* :  organisms. You see fish of all kinds of colors. We saw a few different species of sharks as well as
*12:08.680- 12:16.140* :  skates and then a whole lot of crabs, squat lobsters that tend to climb at the top of these corals
*12:16.140- 12:23.180* :  and extend their arms to try and capture food. Let's let's talk about the discovery and why is
*12:23.180- 12:29.240* :  this important? We often hear about the demise of coral reefs and coral bleaching due to warm
*12:29.240- 12:36.180* :  waters. So what does this discovery mean? So what's really interesting about this discovery is it
*12:36.180- 12:43.860* :  extends what we know about cold water corals across the world. Obviously it's very expensive to
*12:43.860- 12:50.760* :  send ROVs down to hundreds of meters and so we don't necessarily know all the conditions. The
*12:50.760- 12:56.880* :  environmental conditions in which these corals can thrive and so being able to find other corals
*12:57.000- 13:01.360* :  in other places, we help us understand a little bit more about the range of environmental
*13:01.360- 13:06.000* :  conditions that they can survive in the kinds of temperatures they can survive in. But that allows
*13:06.000- 13:12.580* :  us to better understand in the future as the ocean is changing what might happen to these corals.
*13:12.760- 13:18.860* :  And what's interesting about the Galapagos has been a marine park for decades now and so they
*13:18.860- 13:24.740* :  are in really good condition. Kathleen Robert. Here in Britain a potter has developed
*13:24.740- 13:30.960* :  specially modified mugs for people with disabilities. Nicholas Swan started making ceramics
*13:30.960- 13:35.920* :  on a potter's wheel just eight years ago and recently she was inspired by a friend's husband
*13:35.920- 13:41.220* :  who struggled to hold a typical looking ceramic mug. She's gone on to make more mugs
*13:41.500- 13:46.560* :  tailored to individuals needs. After posting a video of her initial design to social media,
*13:46.560- 13:52.700* :  Nicholas receives hundreds of messages every day with requests for special mugs. She's now turned
*13:52.700- 13:58.560* :  it into a business. When I was contacted by a friend of a friend we worked together to come up with
*13:59.080- 14:05.460* :  a double hand-drawn mug for her husband, I believe he had Alzheimer's and he wasn't enjoying
*14:05.460- 14:11.100* :  drinking out of a plastic sippy cup because she could only find very medical looking cups.
*14:12.080- 14:16.900* :  So I worked correspondingly with them what they were actually looking for and came up with a
*14:16.900- 14:22.580* :  double hand-drawn mug with a lowered handle so we could put a silicone lid on it for when
*14:22.580- 14:27.880* :  you needed to use a straw. But there are others too aren't there? You've made more specialist
*14:27.880- 14:36.680* :  mugs for individual needs. Yes, because I put that one out on my accounts the next thing was a
*14:36.680- 14:42.960* :  friend got in touch saying to dad really likes that mug but he doesn't want another handle that's
*14:42.960- 14:49.820* :  really obvious. So I kind of just it was like an almost like a little block on the side that he
*14:49.820- 14:56.160* :  could rest his hand, rest on top of his second hand to give him this stability because he had a
*14:56.160- 15:01.660* :  tremor and then really it's just come from people approaching me I've having to see what I've made
*15:01.660- 15:06.680* :  for other people saying I've got this problem or occupational therapists have come into my
*15:06.680- 15:11.760* :  live streams when I've been on social media describing what some of the issues they've got with
*15:11.760- 15:17.680* :  some of their patients and work with people to come with different ideas. And a video of your
*15:17.680- 15:24.740* :  pottery went viral on social media in April with more than 800,000 views. What's that been like?
*15:25.560- 15:30.340* :  So yeah, he seems to hit on different platforms all at the same time because some of these
*15:30.340- 15:36.340* :  mugs have been making for a couple of years. I was just part-time potter working in
*15:36.340- 15:41.500* :  Mashedudio and putting things in the shop and he always said I will always have these in alongside
*15:41.500- 15:47.200* :  my other mugs. So if anyone ever comes across me once one but then they just started selling out
*15:47.200- 15:54.060* :  going off on the social media and I genuinely couldn't keep up I was making them day and night
*15:54.060- 16:00.440* :  and I'd list them and they'd fell out in under 10 minutes. What's the furthest that you've reached
*16:00.440- 16:06.640* :  around the world? If we say it had gone global there's I've had people contacting me from Australia
*16:06.640- 16:14.320* :  there's a lot of people in America that have been asking all over Europe. It just seems to have been
*16:14.360- 16:20.800* :  that people don't want a medical aid they just want to sit and continue to enjoy drinking their
*16:20.800- 16:27.120* :  cupaks. Somebody may just have weakness in them on and not have a condition such as
*16:27.400- 16:33.480* :  Alzheimer's or dementia that wants the dignity of just drinking out of them or black everybody else.
*16:34.220- 16:37.880* :  And you can see Nicholas Mugs on her Instagram page made with mud.

*18:56.300- 19:02.200* :  For six consecutive days at the start of November, the entire country was powered by wind,
*19:02.200- 19:08.160* :  solar and hydropower. More renewable energy was produced than was actually needed by households
*19:08.160- 19:13.820* :  and industry, with some being exported to neighbouring Spain. I spoke to our correspondent in
*19:13.820- 19:20.180* :  Lisbon, Alison Roberts. Well, in fact, there's now quite a long tradition of investing. First of all
*19:20.220- 19:25.020* :  in hydroelectric power, there are a lot of fast flowing rivers in the highlands that make that
*19:25.020- 19:32.140* :  possible and more recently an onshore wind power and now increasingly in solar power as well.
*19:32.520- 19:38.900* :  There are even combined projects such as floating solar plants on the reservoirs that were created
*19:38.900- 19:44.860* :  by a hydroelectric dam. So, sort of getting a wind wind approach there. And now the investment
*19:44.860- 19:51.540* :  is probably going to go into the more expensive but also larger offshore wind projects. They're
*19:51.740- 19:57.380* :  just going to start doing that now. There are also various pilot projects in tidal and wave power.
*19:57.380- 20:01.940* :  There have been various experiments, not all of which have gone as well as they might want them to.
*20:01.980- 20:08.780* :  But it's certainly been a consensual strategy in recent decades. In fact, the last coal-fired plant
*20:08.860- 20:14.360* :  shut down two years ago, a little later than expected initially. And that was making Portugal
*20:14.360- 20:18.740* :  only the fourth European Union member state to wind up coal altogether.
*20:19.600- 20:23.600* :  So, what has Portugal done and the Portuguese government done to make this possible?
*20:24.320- 20:28.760* :  Way back in 2016, the entire country managed to rely on renewables for four days.
*20:28.760- 20:33.900* :  Just in February of this year, there was a weekend when the country didn't use any non-reminuable
*20:33.900- 20:39.180* :  electricity. And in fact, in 2018, for the whole month of March, overall, over that month,
*20:39.200- 20:43.700* :  Portugal produced more power from renewables than it needed over the month. So, that was the first
*20:43.700- 20:49.500* :  time that that had happened. So, there is definitely a consensus here in Portugal that this investment
*20:49.500- 20:54.480* :  needs to continue. Alison Roberts, Portugal is very ambitious when it comes to going green.
*20:54.480- 20:59.520* :  As well as closing its coal power stations, as Alison mentioned, there are also plans to close
*20:59.520- 21:05.440* :  all its natural gas power plants by 2040 and double the country's solar and hydrogen energy
*21:05.440- 21:12.120* :  capacity with the hope of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Pedro Amaral George is the president
*21:12.120- 21:18.240* :  of the Portuguese Renewable Energy Association, apron. He's optimistic about the country's continued
*21:18.240- 21:24.600* :  push for renewables. Portugal, because it's a very narrow piece of land, between winds,
*21:25.040- 21:31.820* :  water and sun, we are always with a huge amount of renewable resources to be converted into electricity.
*21:32.460- 21:38.400* :  So, I think it's highly likely that we will continue to grow in the incorporation of renewable
*21:38.400- 21:44.140* :  energy and electricity generation. And of course, if we do this properly and I'm betting and I'm
*21:44.160- 21:49.560* :  betting my professional life that we will, we would be able to make sure that we create this
*21:49.560- 21:54.440* :  compound of renewable energy sources that will allow us not only to generate electricity,
*21:55.020- 21:59.380* :  but also green hydrogen and synthetic or renewable fuels of non-biological origin.
*22:00.220- 22:07.680* :  So, I'm really, really positive. Pedro Amaral George. Billions of women around the world
*22:07.680- 22:13.020* :  have periods, but it's not something that's often talked about. In various cultures, religions
*22:13.020- 22:19.100* :  and societies, menstruation is seen as a topic that should be avoided, whispered about or even
*22:19.100- 22:24.860* :  a taboo. This leaves many women and girls around the world uneducated and unsure about their
*22:24.860- 22:30.740* :  own period cycles, ashamed to ask questions and unaware of how to practice safe hygiene.
*22:30.780- 22:36.900* :  One project that is addressing this stigma head on is the Indian comic book series Menstrupedia.
*22:37.300- 22:43.380* :  Its creator, Aditi Gupta, has spent nearly a decade demystifying menstruation in her country
*22:43.380- 22:52.160* :  and beyond. Lorna Aqua has been finding out more. This is a story about three friends who are
*22:52.160- 22:57.880* :  going to learn about an important, this is the sound of a cartoon that's reached millions of
*22:57.880- 23:06.000* :  people in India. It's the creation of Aditi Gupta, who like many women, grew up in a society
*23:06.000- 23:11.820* :  deeply affected by menstrual stigma. None of the girls menstruating would know why do period happen,
*23:12.680- 23:17.180* :  what happens during her periods, but everybody seems to know that this is something that you don't
*23:17.180- 23:22.980* :  have to talk about. A huge part of it is use as a control mechanism. It is used in all societies
*23:22.980- 23:30.500* :  really. Any fluid that comes out of a women's body is seen as a taboo. So, I grew up looking at
*23:30.500- 23:37.020* :  myself like that and periods were always very limiting for me. Sharing these experiences with her
*23:37.020- 23:42.360* :  husband while at university made them realise two things. How little they knew about menstruation
*23:42.360- 23:48.180* :  and how much needed to change. Tuhin and I are communication designers. You are studying how
*23:48.180- 23:54.420* :  design can change human behaviour and make them feel comfortable about a certain topic or a certain
*23:55.520- 24:00.340* :  function. They settled on comics and that's how menstruapidia was born. The first comic was
*24:00.340- 24:05.420* :  published in 2014. I got Aditi to talk me through its characters and how they're filling the
*24:05.420- 24:13.700* :  menstrual knowledge gap in India. How menstruapidia comic book. Yes Pinky, this comic book explains
*24:13.700- 24:19.400* :  everything about periods in a very... So you have Pinky, Jaya and Meera. So these characters
*24:19.400- 24:25.020* :  really represent three segment, readers segment. One who has not gotten her periods and she is
*24:25.040- 24:30.820* :  curious about growing up. One who gets periods during the narrative of the book so that the readers
*24:30.820- 24:36.840* :  come to know what to do when they get their periods and then we have Meera who has been getting
*24:36.840- 24:42.140* :  her periods and then she has sort of misconception and through her the readers come to know what are
*24:42.140- 24:48.560* :  the myths and misconceptions. Let me answer all your questions one by one. Every month that's
*24:48.940- 24:55.360* :  she's a doctor in the cartoon and the driving force educating menstruapidia's characters and readers.
*24:55.740- 25:02.240* :  We also talk about a little bit about how to take care of cloth pad if you're using a cloth pad.
*25:02.240- 25:08.140* :  We are talking about what to do when you get your periods in school, how to dispose these napkins
*25:08.780- 25:12.220* :  and how to keep yourself clean on a regular basis when you're on your periods.
*25:12.940- 25:18.080* :  These comics started out as physical books that have now been distributed to more than 25,000
*25:18.080- 25:23.260* :  schools across the world. They've also been animated into cartoons available on YouTube in 17
*25:23.260- 25:27.800* :  languages including some of India's most spoken languages like Hindi and Gujarati.
*25:28.420- 25:34.280* :  Right now 13 different countries publish and print menstruapidia comic in their own language
*25:35.040- 25:40.660* :  and the characters look like them like for example the book that is in Shona language in Zimbabwe
*25:40.660- 25:45.480* :  the characters look like them and in Shona language I think it is the only piece of literature that
*25:45.480- 25:51.040* :  is on menstruation. Right now those girls who are reading the comic book are growing up and
*25:51.040- 25:56.660* :  they are teaching the junior girls in their class about menstruation. The whole shift in collective
*25:56.660- 26:03.540* :  system is something that is very fascinating for me and I'm so grateful to live this life where I
*26:03.540- 26:09.640* :  could see this change happening. Everyone faces a bit of inconvenience during periods so always
*26:09.640- 26:12.660* :  help each other out and take care of each other.
*26:13.980- 26:19.360* :  Lorna Aquas speaking to a DT Gupta. You can hear more stories about tackling period poverty
*26:19.360- 26:24.980* :  by searching for BBC people fixing the world online or wherever you get your podcasts.
*26:26.320- 26:31.960* :  She's a ginger cat from Stevenage in England who's risen to online fame recently after being
*26:31.960- 26:37.520* :  photographed hundreds of times in her favourite spot the ticket barriers at the local train station
*26:38.120- 26:43.800* :  but now Nala's fame could be about to go to a new level because her owner has produced a song
*26:44.200- 26:50.180* :  using her noises or meows and is hoping to get the coveted Christmas number one spot in the UK
*26:50.180- 26:56.400* :  music charts. The song even got the attention of our friend the DJ of BBC Radio 2 Scott Mills.
*26:57.620- 27:02.880* :  Stevenage train station has hired itself a new ticket officer. She's called Nala.
*27:04.140- 27:09.040* :  She's a cat and the commuters are getting a bit obsessed. So much so one of them has made a song
*27:09.040- 27:11.140* :  about her and I won't lie it's quite good.
*27:18.300- 27:20.160* :  Song is called Meow in case you're wondering.
*27:24.000- 27:28.880* :  Nala just sits on the top of the ticket barrier. There is a wrap in it as well.
*27:32.460- 27:32.940* :  Who's there?
*27:41.900- 27:44.620* :  I mean, worst has got to Christmas number one before.
*27:45.520- 27:49.080* :  Andrew Peach has been talking to Nala's owner Natasha Ambla.
*27:49.760- 27:55.400* :  She did those new adventures beforehand but now it's particularly at the train station.
*27:55.400- 27:58.520* :  She gets all the attention so she just goes there now.
*27:59.180- 28:04.800* :  Okay and like any 21st century influencer you think okay people like taking my
*28:04.800- 28:08.940* :  photo to railway station. How am I going to branch out into other areas of show business?
*28:09.380- 28:11.500* :  Maybe I can learn to sing and release a single.
*28:13.000- 28:17.280* :  Yeah, you know, it's just a really funny thing because obviously she's been quite in a few
*28:17.280- 28:22.280* :  countries now so a lot of people know about her. So we thought why don't we just make a
*28:22.280- 28:27.700* :  Christmas song and make some money for charity and we can give back even more to the community.
*28:27.820- 28:34.260* :  That's just too big a leap but my cat is popular with people as a local railway station.
*28:34.620- 28:38.800* :  Maybe we can release a Christmas song. How did that happen in your mind?
*28:40.280- 28:44.920* :  Yeah, honestly, everything just happened so so quickly and it's been so well-mimbed
*28:44.920- 28:51.120* :  but we thought yeah, let's just see what's out there. Let's just try it and see if we can
*28:51.120- 28:55.340* :  make some money for it. So how did you go about, you know, thinking well,
*28:55.380- 28:58.100* :  well, how can we put this music together? Who did that for you?
*28:58.600- 29:04.080* :  Funny enough, we have a mutual friend so we contacted a producer and he contacted
*29:04.080- 29:09.240* :  their songwriter and they were all on board and yeah, they produced what we've produced today.
*29:09.940- 29:14.460* :  We didn't want something like a particularly Christmasy song. We wanted to feel good
*29:14.460- 29:21.520* :  up the catchy, still good, happy song but everyone could like sing along with it or
*29:22.480- 29:23.640* :  yeah, just a little feel good.
*29:31.400- 29:36.840* :  Natasha Ambla speaking to Andrew Peach about this music featuring train station loving
*29:36.840- 29:43.500* :  Nala the Cat. Before we go, an update from a story in last week's episode,
*29:43.500- 29:49.460* :  we heard from Neil Jones who was working as a Tyler before a win on the UK National Lottery
*29:49.760- 29:55.020* :  allowed him to give up the day job and buy a pool table. Well, this month, Neil won a bronze
*29:55.020- 30:01.060* :  medal for England in the European pool championships in Malta. And our listener Thomas has been in
*30:01.060- 30:06.480* :  touch to tell us about a mimeing festival that's taking place this week in Liptovsky,
*30:06.480- 30:14.480* :  Michelash in Slovakia. The festival is focused on children and teenagers. It started small but
*30:14.480- 30:25.340* :  now in this year there is 350 young people who laugh mime and pantomime and they are eager to
*30:25.340- 30:32.160* :  learn. It's 300 people but the atmosphere is like a family. We love it when our listeners get
