*00:41.480- 00:46.180* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway and we're recording this edition at 14 hours GMT on Tuesday,
*00:46.180- 00:51.840* :  the 28th of November. Rescuers in Northern India begin an operation to pull 41 construction
*00:51.840- 00:57.760* :  workers out of a collapsed tunnel through a narrow pipe. The truce in Gaza appears to be holding
*00:57.760- 01:02.860* :  for a fifth day after a swap deal between Israel and Hamas was extended. I was talking about this
*01:02.860- 01:05.880* :  obligation that we have to get as many people out as possible, if that includes a pause,
*01:05.880- 01:12.180* :  not a ceasefire, a pause for a number of days, then so be it. And the first long-haul flight
*01:12.180- 01:19.940* :  powered by alternative fuel has taken off from London. Also in the podcast. Beyond our wildest dreams,
*01:20.080- 01:25.680* :  it's the incredibly beautiful rock. It's very, very black but with some tiny little white bits in
*01:25.680- 01:30.460* :  as well. Scientists get their hands on a sample from the Venue Asteroid.
*01:35.500- 01:41.560* :  After 17 days trapped underground, 41 construction workers in Northern India are expected to reach
*01:41.560- 01:46.880* :  the open air in the coming hours. The day labourers had been helping to build a road tunnel in the
*01:46.880- 01:52.560* :  foothills of the Himalayas when part of it collapsed. After numerous setbacks, rescuers finally broke
*01:52.560- 01:58.040* :  through on Tuesday afternoon. Specialist miners dug the last few metres by hand when drilling
*01:58.040- 02:03.720* :  equipment broke. This was the scene at the tunnel entrance as families and rescuers waited for the
*02:03.720- 02:15.700* :  men to be pulled out. The authorities have not said what caused the landslide but there's been
*02:15.700- 02:20.760* :  criticism of the one and a half billion dollar chart-darm road project which is backed by
*02:20.760- 02:25.980* :  the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The tunnel didn't have an emergency exit and was built through
*02:25.980- 02:31.620* :  a geological fault, according to a disaster investigator quoted by Reuters news agency.
*02:32.440- 02:37.140* :  Just before we recorded this podcast, I got the latest from our correspondent Anant Zanani
*02:37.140- 02:44.680* :  at the tunnel entrance. There is a lot of presence of ordinary people as well, not just personnel
*02:44.680- 02:50.460* :  who've been doing various kinds of works here to bring these workers out but it's his ordinary
*02:50.460- 02:56.820* :  people who live in villages nearby who are here who are also in a sense hoping for that good news
*02:56.820- 03:01.540* :  that everyone is talking about for the last couple of hours at that breakthrough of both ends of
*03:01.540- 03:05.580* :  the pipeline that they were laying down has been achieved and it's perhaps just a matter of time
*03:05.580- 03:09.700* :  that these people were brought out. It could take about three to four minutes to bring one worker
*03:09.700- 03:14.280* :  out so that's roughly adds up to about three to four hours but that hasn't really sort of dampen
*03:14.280- 03:18.940* :  the mood here. People are here. The families of those workers who are trapped inside are here.
*03:18.940- 03:24.380* :  They're waiting next to ambulances. There are about 15 to 20 ambulances that I can see from where
*03:24.380- 03:28.440* :  I'm standing. Once these workers come out, be loaded with those workers and their family members
*03:28.440- 03:33.020* :  and they'll make their way to a hospital nearby. Yeah, just take us through how they're going to do
*03:33.020- 03:37.980* :  that. So for weeks they've been trying to get through to the men. They now have made it and they
*03:37.980- 03:43.280* :  managed to put this 90 centimeter wide pipe into the tunnel. How are they going to get the men out?
*03:43.680- 03:50.000* :  This entire operation now is going to be taken care of by the NDRF, which is a national defense
*03:50.000- 03:55.020* :  rescue force. They're the ones who are going to leave this operation now. So what essentially they're
*03:55.020- 04:00.420* :  going to do is once these workers have reached the other end of the tunnel, the NDRF workers,
*04:00.420- 04:07.280* :  they'll start sending one worker on a stretcher and that's a stretcher that also has wheels to it.
*04:07.280- 04:11.480* :  So it's easy to drag it using a rope and they'll be pulled out of this pipeline,
*04:11.480- 04:19.480* :  this 5758 meter long pipeline and brought out to safety paramedics and doctors inside who quickly
*04:19.480- 04:24.400* :  check them for any kinds of symptoms. Then they'll also meet with the chief minister of the state
*04:24.800- 04:29.120* :  where all of this is happening and then they'll be brought out into these fans and then be loaded
*04:29.120- 04:34.760* :  and they'll be taken with that medical facilities. That's roughly how it's going to unfold. Once all
*04:34.760- 04:39.360* :  these 41 workers are brought out safely, using that pipeline through wheel stretches.
*04:39.960- 04:44.780* :  There will no doubt be joy at what seems to be a happy ending to this incident. But are there
*04:44.780- 04:51.140* :  questions for the Indian authorities over building in this area which was known to be prone to landslides?
*04:51.320- 04:55.840* :  Absolutely and the government was asked this question a couple of days ago and they said that there's
*04:55.840- 05:00.180* :  a committee that's looking into all of this now but you know they said we'll park that for later
*05:00.760- 05:05.760* :  but right now the focus is entirely on this rescue operation. Even the workers and their families
*05:05.760- 05:10.500* :  are saying why did this really happen in the first place? If this was such a tough terrain,
*05:10.500- 05:18.240* :  the geology of this entire landscape was questionable. If there was loose area between the point
*05:18.240- 05:23.400* :  from where the landside happened, why was no effort made to strengthen it? Why were workers
*05:24.580- 05:27.980* :  working beyond that point in the tunnel? So these are many unanswered questions and also there's
*05:28.320- 05:32.640* :  this whole idea about having an escape tunnel which was not there. So when you're building a
*05:32.640- 05:36.780* :  tunnel, you're ideally supposed to have an escape tunnel. So in case of an event like this,
*05:36.780- 05:41.840* :  a landslide event like this, when the roof of the tunnel collapses, you can come out through escape
*05:41.840- 05:45.760* :  routes. Where were those escape routes? These are many unanswered questions that were
*05:46.180- 05:50.740* :  really hound the authorities and also this company that was making this tunnel.
*05:51.280- 05:57.340* :  And Ansonani at the tunnel entrance in northern India. By the end of tomorrow if all goes according
*05:57.340- 06:01.940* :  to plan more than a third of the hostages abducted by a Palestinian gunman last month
*06:01.940- 06:08.880* :  will have been freed. Despite reports of gunfire in Gaza today, 20 more Israeli women and children
*06:08.880- 06:14.260* :  are due to be released over the next 48 hours after the swap deal with Hamas was extended.
*06:14.960- 06:20.240* :  Mediators are pushing for a further extension. But negotiations over the remaining captives,
*06:20.240- 06:26.080* :  some of whom are soldiers are likely to be tougher. While Israel is keen to restart its military
*06:26.080- 06:29.640* :  offensive as soon as possible, as we're a Davis now reports.
*06:32.080- 06:37.920* :  This is the plaza in central Tel Aviv that's become the focal point for the friends and families
*06:37.920- 06:44.540* :  of those who are abducted, kidnapped by Hamas and have been in Gaza ever since October 7th.
*06:44.540- 06:50.620* :  The names and the faces of the men, women and children are everywhere. And in the last four days,
*06:50.620- 06:56.220* :  it's become often a scene of joy as the names of the women and children who have been released
*06:56.880- 07:01.380* :  have been made public. But there's always been a sense of trepidation that those four days of
*07:01.600- 07:07.380* :  relative calm would come to an end. And of course many people would still remain hostages in
*07:07.920- 07:13.300* :  Gaza itself. So the news that that truth has been extended by at least another couple of days
*07:13.940- 07:15.740* :  has been universally welcomed here.
*07:18.340- 07:22.100* :  I'm a very good friend of mine who would do security at the party. Shlomi Ziv has now been
*07:22.100- 07:27.500* :  taken hostage into the Gaza Strip. And unfortunately he's a male and he's 40 years old. He's not
*07:27.500- 07:33.320* :  going to be part of this pause for the next couple of days. And would you be prepared to delay the
*07:33.320- 07:39.600* :  military action that is inevitable until as many people are out as possible? Yeah, absolutely.
*07:39.680- 07:42.680* :  I was talking about this obligation that we have to get as many people out as possible. If that
*07:42.680- 07:47.360* :  includes a pause, notice is for a pause for a number of days, then so be it.
*07:47.620- 07:55.040* :  This is the first priority in our country that everyone will be home no matter what the price.
*07:55.740- 08:00.940* :  A two-day extension will not be straightforward. Not all of the hostages are thought to be held
*08:00.940- 08:06.480* :  in the same parts of Gaza. And some of them were probably abducted by groups other than Hamas.
*08:06.480- 08:12.240* :  Says the BBC's Gaza correspondent, Rusty Abu Aluf, now working out of Istanbul.
*08:12.720- 08:17.380* :  Not only Hamas but the Palestinian Islamic Jihad also went in and they announced that they have
*08:17.380- 08:22.980* :  30, some smaller group. They were held in some of the hostages. Some of the hostages were taken
*08:22.980- 08:28.360* :  by just ordinary people by families because many families they went inside thousands of people
*08:28.360- 08:33.720* :  since the fence was cut. Mary Eisen is a retired colonel in the Israeli defence forces
*08:34.200- 08:39.380* :  and is an expert on security issues. She says the extended troops will be temporary.
*08:39.380- 08:45.980* :  And Israel's military priority to crush Hamas will not waver whatever the external pressures.
*08:46.460- 08:53.280* :  Israel has said hostages and dismantling Hamas. It doesn't contradict only the military
*08:53.280- 09:01.240* :  action brought Hamas to a real negotiation table. You need the diplomacy to bring the people
*09:01.280- 09:05.520* :  home. But the only reason they came in the first place is because of the ground military
*09:05.520- 09:09.360* :  option. Not the aerial one and certainly not just the diplomacy.
*09:12.940- 09:18.080* :  Julius celebrations in the West Bank city of Ramallah have welcomed the dozens of Palestinians
*09:18.080- 09:25.160* :  freed as part of the deal between Hamas and Israel. 33 Palestinians, including 30 teenagers,
*09:25.700- 09:31.680* :  were released from Israeli prisons yesterday alone. Nor a day a political analyst and former
*09:31.680- 09:37.520* :  spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority says Hamas may be eventually defeated militarily
*09:37.520- 09:44.080* :  by Israel in Gaza. But it has shown it must be part of any discussions about a future Palestinian
*09:44.080- 09:49.560* :  state. Palestinian leaders should be acceptable to the Palestinians, not to their occupiers.
*09:50.620- 09:57.620* :  And I think the thinking that Palestinians can simply overlook Hamas or pretend that it doesn't
*09:57.620- 10:05.140* :  exist is disastrous. And it's really more about giving ordinary Palestinians their voice back,
*10:05.140- 10:08.960* :  their right to choose who leads them and in what direction.
*10:14.360- 10:19.660* :  And Israeli mother cries with joy, seeing her child's name on a list of those to be released
*10:19.660- 10:26.140* :  from Gaza. The past few days have brought moments of relief, joy and anguish on both sides,
*10:26.980- 10:32.160* :  conflicting emotions, interbulent times for Israelis and Palestinians.
*10:32.300- 10:40.100* :  We're a Davis in Tel Aviv. Well, as part of the original deal, Israel freed a total of 150 Palestinian
*10:40.100- 10:48.760* :  teenage boys and women, including Itaf Jaradat. The price of our freedom is expensive.
*10:48.780- 10:53.040* :  We always hope that we would be freed and that our people would be safe and happy,
*10:53.040- 10:59.600* :  but this is our destiny. We were freed, but they are in the sea of blood. We hope God grants
*10:59.600- 11:03.540* :  victory to the resistance and that Gaza returns better than it was before.
*11:04.060- 11:09.340* :  But since the Hamas massacre of the 7th of October, the number of Palestinians in Israeli detention
*11:09.340- 11:15.760* :  is reported to have shot up to around 8,000, many of them held without charge. As we heard,
*11:15.760- 11:20.460* :  our Gaza correspondent, Rushdie Abu Aluf, is now covering the conflict from Istanbul.
*11:21.200- 11:24.500* :  I asked him what he'd been hearing about possible clashes in Gaza.
*11:25.180- 11:29.740* :  There's only one person injured according to medical sources. He was shot in his leg.
*11:30.000- 11:36.360* :  The Hamas-e-Ranhil ministry said he was trying to return to his house and shot a refugee camp.
*11:36.360- 11:41.220* :  It's the beach. The only refugee camp in Gaza, they said he was shot in his leg back.
*11:41.460- 11:46.680* :  This morning, there was an exit change fire and about three sublusions around this area.
*11:46.680- 11:53.240* :  It's located in the north west of Gaza, where we can still see some small glazing out of a building
*11:53.240- 11:57.820* :  that was hit by an Israeli tank shell, according to a local journalist who I managed to
*11:57.820- 12:03.920* :  spoke to. The communication is extremely difficult in the ground, especially in Gaza City and
*12:03.920- 12:10.120* :  the north, where the Israelis are focusing its ground operation. The Qataris, the Egyptian,
*12:10.120- 12:15.320* :  who are mediating the ceasefire are aware of this and they said this is not a very serious
*12:15.320- 12:21.800* :  development and they are talking to Hamas and the Israelis try to contain the situation and allow
*12:21.820- 12:29.680* :  the ceasefire take place and the aid they convoy to arrive in Gaza. We understand that up to
*12:29.680- 12:35.640* :  a hundred trucks were allowed this morning and more will be allowed later on today, mainly carrying
*12:35.640- 12:42.700* :  food, water and medical supplies. But what people need, they have been calling in social media when
*12:42.700- 12:48.600* :  the internet was resumed in the south, that they need shelters and they need a clue, this
*12:48.600- 12:55.060* :  proverb for the winter because it was very windy this morning and it was heavily raining around
*12:55.060- 13:01.220* :  the places where about a million Palestinians are displaced from their homes in Gaza City and
*13:01.220- 13:06.600* :  the north and now they are taking the southern part of Gaza's shelter, especially in Hanyunis,
*13:06.600- 13:12.660* :  where many UN schools have been turned into a shelter. There is no proverb thing to protect the
*13:12.660- 13:17.760* :  people from the rain and the wind. The BBC's Gaza correspondent Rushdie Abu Alif talking to us
*13:17.760- 13:24.240* :  from Istanbul. A flight has taken off from London bound for New York that some hope could help the
*13:24.240- 13:30.580* :  aviation industry reduce its carbon emissions. It is the first transatlantic flight powered by
*13:30.580- 13:35.960* :  alternative fuel, but environmental groups labeled it greenwashing. Kate Hewitt,
*13:35.960- 13:40.660* :  policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation says this flight will not make much difference.
*13:41.320- 13:46.820* :  Sadly, it is more of a gimmick than a game change of this. A single flight operating on 100%
*13:46.820- 13:54.340* :  alternative fuel isn't going to change the fact that as we've heard 99.9% of aviation fuel is still
*13:54.340- 14:00.040* :  caracene and these kind of waste-based fuels aren't going to be possible to scale up to really change
*14:00.040- 14:05.560* :  that situation. I spoke to our international business correspondent Theo Leggett and asked him first
*14:05.560- 14:10.800* :  what this alternative fuel is made of. Well, what they're using is something called sustainable
*14:10.800- 14:16.400* :  aviation fuel. Now that's fuel that's chemically pretty much identical to caracene, which is
*14:16.400- 14:21.960* :  jet fuel as you and I would know it. The difference being it doesn't come from crude oil, it's made in
*14:21.960- 14:27.600* :  this case largely from waste fats and also from some farm residues, residues of corn farming.
*14:27.600- 14:34.540* :  Sustainable fuels are being seen as a vital component in the greening of aviation because the
*14:34.540- 14:39.760* :  industry has a problem. It's growing very rapidly and it wants to keep growing very rapidly,
*14:40.040- 14:45.720* :  but when it comes to reducing its carbon output, it's very very difficult. For short haul flights,
*14:45.720- 14:51.220* :  there are options on the table, so for example, electric and hybrid planes or planes powered by
*14:51.220- 14:57.200* :  hydrogen. Those conceivably can work in the future over shorter distances, but when it comes to
*14:57.300- 15:01.460* :  flying across the Atlantic batteries aren't really an option because they're too heavy for the
*15:01.460- 15:06.560* :  amount of energy they produce. Whereas hydrogen, it does produce a lot of energy, but it's difficult
*15:06.560- 15:11.060* :  to store. It's very very bulky. So to cross the Atlantic, your plane would need to be absolutely
*15:11.060- 15:17.000* :  full of hydrogen, even if it's called and liquefied. So in order to get to a sort of lower carbon
*15:17.000- 15:22.620* :  environment, sustainable fuels are being seen as the main way to go, at least in the short term.
*15:22.620- 15:29.200* :  The problem is making these fuels isn't particularly easy. It's expensive at the moment. The feedstocks,
*15:29.200- 15:34.760* :  so the waste fuels, the agricultural residues, the forestry residues, they're limited. There is an
*15:34.760- 15:40.560* :  alternative in which you can make it from waste-combed dioxide and hydrogen, but then you need a good
*15:40.560- 15:45.760* :  supply of hydrogen and we simply aren't able to do that at the moment. This is kind of a longer term
*15:45.760- 15:51.300* :  thing. The industry needs to ramp up. There needs to be a much bigger supply of sustainable fuels
*15:51.300- 15:54.900* :  in order for it to become viable and the costs really need to come down as well.
*15:55.240- 15:59.420* :  Theolegates, our international business, corresponded. Now, it was one of the biggest
*15:59.420- 16:04.540* :  science stories of the year. In September, NASA successfully brought back rock samples from an
*16:04.540- 16:09.880* :  asteroid called Bennu. Now, after a journey of more than six billion kilometers through space
*16:09.880- 16:15.620* :  and a dramatic landing in the Utah desert, a sample has arrived in the UK. Here's our science editor,
*16:15.620- 16:20.840* :  Rebecca Morel. At the Natural History Museum in London, scientists have been waiting for years
*16:20.840- 16:26.900* :  to get their gloved hands on these jet-black specks of asteroid dust. The material comes from a
*16:26.900- 16:32.020* :  500 metre wide space rock called Bennu and was collected by a NASA spacecraft and brought back
*16:32.020- 16:37.240* :  to Earth in September. About a teaspoon full of the sample has now been shared with the museum
*16:37.240- 16:43.280* :  and some universities in the UK, and while this might not sound like much, every single grain of
*16:43.280- 16:48.980* :  the asteroid will be carefully analysed. Professor Sarah Russell is a planetary scientist at the Natural
*16:48.980- 16:55.360* :  History Museum. It's beyond our wildest dreams. It's the incredibly beautiful rock. It's very,
*16:55.360- 17:00.260* :  very black, but with some tiny little white bits in as well, and we've found that each little grain
*17:00.260- 17:04.840* :  looks a bit different to the other grain, so it's going to keep us busy for years trying to figure
*17:04.840- 17:10.520* :  it all out. Scientists are particularly interested in studying water and carbon within the rock.
*17:11.020- 17:15.200* :  One idea is that an asteroid like Bennu crashed into the Earth early in its history,
*17:15.620- 17:19.940* :  delivering the organic molecules that make life here possible. Rebecca Morrell.
*17:23.140- 17:29.280* :  Still to come on the global news podcast? It mimics the kind of perfect conditions of a cellar,
*17:29.400- 17:34.320* :  but more extreme, and the pressure is sent to just be a kind of a different style.
*17:34.800- 17:38.740* :  A new way of storing wine inspired by a 19th century shipwreck.
*17:45.480- 17:50.740* :  The wife of the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Mariana Budanova, is being treated in
*17:50.740- 17:56.160* :  hospital for the effects of poisoning. Unnamed official suspect it was an attempt to assassinate her.
*17:56.540- 17:58.760* :  Here's our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Eberhardt.
*17:59.020- 18:02.920* :  Ukraine has not publicly given details of Mariana Budanova's condition,
*18:02.920- 18:09.220* :  nor of what she said to have ingested. Ukrainian media reports citing intelligence sources say she's
*18:09.260- 18:14.080* :  believed to have eaten contaminated food and that she's completed an initial course of treatment.
*18:14.300- 18:20.640* :  One reports as her husband, Kirilla Budanova, is unaffected, but officials believe he's been
*18:20.640- 18:26.420* :  targeted previously in assassination plots. General Budanova said in an interview earlier this year
*18:26.420- 18:31.440* :  that he lives with his wife in the office. He's on an official wanted list in Russia.
*18:32.060- 18:36.120* :  The service he leads has been linked to sabotage attacks, including drone strikes,
*18:36.120- 18:42.260* :  in occupied Ukraine and Russia itself. Danny Eberhardt. A long-running disagreement between
*18:42.260- 18:47.760* :  Britain and Greece over the path and on sculptures, or Elgin Marbles, has erupted into a diplomatic
*18:47.760- 18:53.200* :  row. The sculptures are housed in the British Museum after being brought here in the 19th century,
*18:53.200- 18:58.360* :  and Greece wants them back. But the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has cancelled a meeting
*18:58.360- 19:04.060* :  with his Greek counterpart. After the visiting, Kiriakos Mitsultakis, made these comments on BBC
*19:04.060- 19:10.160* :  TV on Sunday. This is not an, in my mind, an ownership question. This is a reunification argument.
*19:10.160- 19:17.200* :  Where can you best appreciate what is essentially one monument? I mean, it's as if I told you
*19:17.200- 19:21.040* :  that you would cut the Mona Lisa in half, and you would have half of it at the Louvre,
*19:21.180- 19:26.200* :  and half of it at the British Museum. Do you think your viewers would appreciate the beauty of
*19:26.200- 19:30.900* :  the painting in such a way? Well, this is exactly what happened with the Parthenon sculptures.
*19:31.520- 19:35.180* :  The British government said it believed it had assurances. That, the Greek Prime Minister,
*19:35.180- 19:39.680* :  wouldn't speak out while on his UK visit, but a Greek source has denied this.
*19:40.220- 19:45.160* :  The debate has become more heated recently after some museums and governments around the world
*19:45.160- 19:49.660* :  began returning artefacts to their countries of origin. I got the latest on the
*19:49.660- 19:54.780* :  rouse from the global news podcast, Peter Goffin. We've seen a statement from the British Museum,
*19:54.780- 20:00.180* :  which says it's in discussions with Greece about a long-term partnership around the Parthenon
*20:00.620- 20:05.840* :  sculptures so that they can be shared with audiences around the world while still in the museum's
*20:05.840- 20:11.740* :  words, maintaining the integrity of the British Museum's collection. The museum has also said
*20:12.240- 20:17.560* :  that under current British law, it cannot unilaterally decide to send artefacts permanently back
*20:17.560- 20:22.800* :  to their countries of origin, though they can be loaned out. But this issue goes far beyond the,
*20:22.940- 20:27.560* :  so-called, elegant marbles. So, Ollie, I would like to take you on a little tour of the British
*20:27.560- 20:34.000* :  Museum. We'll start with another headliner artefact, the Rosetta Stone. This is the giant
*20:34.000- 20:40.040* :  tablet that helped modern scholars understand ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. It was uncovered by
*20:40.040- 20:45.460* :  Napoleon's occupying armies, then taken by Britain as a spoil of war. Last year, thousands of
*20:45.460- 20:50.320* :  Egyptians signed petitions demanding it back and calling the stones presence in the British
*20:50.320- 20:56.540* :  Museum a symbol of Western cultural violence. Now, speaking of stone, the British Museum also has
*20:56.540- 21:02.520* :  two MOI statues. You may know them better as the Easter Island heads. They were taken from
*21:02.520- 21:07.580* :  Polynesia by the British Navy in the 1800s and given as a gift to Queen Victoria. Well, now the
*21:07.580- 21:11.940* :  descendants of the indigenous people who carved those statues have said they represent the
*21:11.940- 21:17.020* :  spirits of their ancestors, and Chile, which owns Easter Island, has tried to negotiate their
*21:17.020- 21:22.360* :  return so far without success. And before we leave the museum, Ollie, I want to show you
*21:22.640- 21:28.740* :  to the Benin bronzes, these elaborate carvings from what is now Nigeria. They decorated the royal
*21:28.740- 21:34.680* :  palaces of the Edo people and were used in rituals. They were looted by British colonial forces
*21:34.680- 21:39.820* :  near the end of the 1800s as part of a brutal crackdown on Benin's leaders. Some were sold
*21:39.820- 21:44.840* :  on to Germany. Many of them still in the British Museum, a strong point of contention between
*21:44.840- 21:52.300* :  Britain and Nigeria. Okay, mention Germany. Some Benin bronzes have been returned by Germany,
*21:52.300- 21:59.020* :  so I guess more pressure on the UK to do the same. That's right. France returned some Benin artifacts
*21:59.020- 22:04.320* :  as well. That was part of a commitment made by the French President Emmanuel Macron to return
*22:04.320- 22:10.860* :  as many artifacts looted from their historical colonies in Africa as possible. He told Burkina Faso
*22:10.860- 22:18.260* :  in 2017 that African heritage can't just be in European private collections and museums. Now,
*22:18.260- 22:23.620* :  Germany, as you mentioned, has taken similar steps. Belgium has recently presented the Democratic
*22:23.620- 22:29.620* :  Republic of Congo with an inventory list of Congolese cultural artifacts that it still has.
*22:29.980- 22:35.280* :  And in North America, there's been a growing movement of major museums returning the remains
*22:35.280- 22:40.600* :  of indigenous people, which have been in their collections as treated basically as specimens
*22:40.600- 22:47.480* :  for decades. Peter Goffin. The winner of the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year has been
*22:47.480- 22:53.860* :  announced its England and Manchester United's Mary Erbs. She's the first goalkeeper to win the
*22:53.860- 22:59.300* :  award. Mars Faroukie from BBC Sports went to Manchester United's training ground to surprise her.
*22:59.940- 23:03.700* :  Everyone, this is for Mary, so should we all hide?
*23:11.980- 23:19.760* :  Mary Erbs. We never said this to a goalkeeper before, but on behalf of the BBC World Service,
*23:19.760- 23:23.760* :  you are the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year 2023. Super special. Thank you very much to
*23:23.760- 23:29.280* :  everyone who voted for me. Yeah, very, very humbled and I'm really glad that I can be the first goalkeeper
*23:29.280- 23:34.520* :  to win it, special. Mary Erbs, sounding a little embarrassed at all the attention, but Mars told me
*23:34.520- 23:39.880* :  more about her reaction. Yes, she was delighted, I think, to win this award because it's a special
*23:39.880- 23:44.320* :  award. This BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award is voted for by the public. And so for her,
*23:44.320- 23:48.900* :  that's something that means an awful lot. She talks an awful lot about in her career, the fact that
*23:49.220- 23:53.240* :  the goalkeeping position, particularly in women's football, isn't one perhaps that has always
*23:53.240- 23:58.940* :  talked about in the same way as say midfielders or forwards. So the fact that a goalkeeper has been
*23:58.940- 24:03.500* :  able to win this award, she feels is a personal, very special moment for her. And of course,
*24:03.500- 24:09.280* :  she's had a really, really impressive and consistent 12 months, both for England and for Manchester United.
*24:09.280- 24:13.500* :  And she's becoming a real role model as well off the pitch as well, which is again something
*24:13.500- 24:18.020* :  that's very, very important to her. Yeah, I mean, just remind us about her performance for England in
*24:18.020- 24:24.080* :  the World Cup. Well, of course, they just fell short in the World Cup final, but she did save a penalty
*24:24.080- 24:29.960* :  from Jenny Hermoso in that final back in August in Sydney. England, though, just losing out to Spain
*24:30.440- 24:34.820* :  in that World Cup final, but they suffered so many injuries heading into that tournament for
*24:34.820- 24:40.400* :  them to even get that far. Really was really impressive. She was also awarded FIFA best goalkeeper
*24:40.400- 24:45.080* :  of the year, golden glove as well at the World Cup for her performances between the sticks.
*24:45.080- 24:51.220* :  She really is one of the most consistent performers in the global game, men's all women's football
*24:51.220- 24:55.780* :  in her position, which is obviously something that she's very proud of. And it's reflected in her,
*24:55.780- 25:00.180* :  you know, winning this award today. Yeah, fans also love her, but they were, of course,
*25:00.180- 25:04.100* :  unhappy. They couldn't get her shirt. Yeah, this is one of the big things that we talked about as
*25:04.100- 25:08.920* :  well ahead of England playing in that World Cup in New Zealand, Australia earlier this year.
*25:09.340- 25:15.780* :  Shirts, England shirts were on sale through their sponsor, Nike, but Mary's goalkeeping jersey was
*25:15.780- 25:19.620* :  not one of those that was initially available. And this was a conversation then that she went back
*25:19.720- 25:25.220* :  to the England sponsors to ask and to reconsider that decision. Patitions were made as well from
*25:25.220- 25:30.180* :  fans because they all wanted to be able to wear the shirt of their favorite player, their goalkeeper
*25:30.180- 25:35.420* :  Mary Erbson. Eventually, Nike did decide to release that shirt in limited numbers. And it was
*25:35.420- 25:41.180* :  a sellout. So it just shows that there is the market there for people to want to buy goalkeeping
*25:41.180- 25:45.440* :  jerseys. And she says with her performances and everything that she's achieved over the last
*25:45.440- 25:50.840* :  12 months for her, what's really important is she wants young girls and boys to want to play in
*25:50.840- 25:55.580* :  gold, to want to be the next goalkeeper, the next Mary Erbson, she really is inspiring the next
*25:55.580- 26:00.580* :  generation in that way. Now, you said fans voted for the award and a couple of international stars also
*26:00.580- 26:06.040* :  did well. Yes, other players involved in this award, of course, we had some other brilliant players
*26:06.040- 26:11.380* :  of Ballendor winner and Antanan Bombati as well was one of the, the real big names up for the
*26:11.380- 26:14.420* :  award this year. It's been a fantastic 12 months for the game. And of course, we've got the
*26:14.420- 26:18.120* :  Olympics as well, the football tournament there to look forward to next year women's football.
*26:18.600- 26:25.380* :  Mass for Rookie. Finally, to a new way of storing wine inspired by a 160 year old shipwreck,
*26:25.800- 26:32.420* :  Verve Kiko has been experimenting with aging its champagne underwater. Some of its bottles and
*26:32.420- 26:36.720* :  those from another French wine maker were found at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and have been
*26:36.720- 26:42.460* :  described by experts as tasting incredible. Wine writer Alicia Hansel spoke to the BBC's Will
*26:42.460- 26:48.080* :  Bain. There is already a winery in Croatia, there's a few people doing experimenting with things in
*26:48.080- 26:54.080* :  Argentina, in the Baltic Sea. So, I'm actually in England, they will, you know, put it in a secure
*26:54.080- 26:59.620* :  kind of crate as it were and then submerge it. The one in England, it was 60 meters under the sea
*27:00.000- 27:05.120* :  and they came to that figure because for every one meter you go down, it increases by certain
*27:05.120- 27:11.780* :  percent of pressure. But essentially, the idea around it is that the science, right, the pressure
*27:11.780- 27:18.360* :  makes a difference. Well, there's a few things. So, first of all, it's because it mimics the kind of
*27:18.360- 27:25.580* :  perfect conditions of a cellar, but more extreme. So, it's a constant temperature, it's cold,
*27:25.580- 27:31.000* :  and more important in which people forget about its dark light actually really can affect wine
*27:31.000- 27:34.440* :  bottle. That's why they're mostly in green glass because it affects the light. So,
*27:35.240- 27:42.640* :  then you've got the more interesting idea of pressure and of the constant rolling,
*27:42.640- 27:47.760* :  gentle lapping of the sea. Which, if anybody's been on a sort of champagne tour on holiday in
*27:47.760- 27:51.660* :  France or whatever, you see them do right by hand, go along and twisting the bottle so
*27:51.660- 27:57.280* :  whenever again. I mean, at that point, the yeast would be in there. So, then the wines that have
*27:57.280- 28:01.440* :  been shipped that were found on the shipwrecked would have been discouraged, and they are using
*28:01.440- 28:08.120* :  disforged wines, i.e. that lead as left. What's interesting about the pressure idea is that obviously,
*28:08.120- 28:14.880* :  there's corks in these bottles, and we don't want any water to even out, obviously. You do hear
*28:14.880- 28:21.500* :  people saying, oh, there's a sailing note, but I think that's more of a... Urban myth. Yeah, exactly,
*28:21.500- 28:27.380* :  because if there's water getting into it, then it's incorrect. However, cork does allow for
*28:27.380- 28:35.160* :  microoxidination, and that's what kind of changes and helps to evolve the flavours of a wine over time.
*28:35.180- 28:40.620* :  So, if you're thinking it's down under pressure, it's got a different amount of oxygen,
*28:40.800- 28:45.580* :  therefore it's a reduced amount of oxygen going into it, and the pressure is said to just be a
*28:45.580- 28:51.640* :  kind of a different style than it leads to kind of a bit more of a freshener. Actually,
*28:51.640- 28:56.540* :  they're a little bit younger than you would probably expect them to be. Wine writer, Alicia Hansel.
*28:59.500- 29:03.880* :  And that is all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon. This
*29:03.880- 29:09.200* :  edition was mixed by Vladimir Morzecka and produced by Tracy Gordon. Our editors, Karen Martin,
*29:09.200- 29:11.420* :  I'm Oliver Conway. Until next time, goodbye.
