*01:13.600- 01:17.140* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:19.460- 01:26.420* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Tuesday, the 28th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:27.060- 01:32.080* :  The pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is extended by two days.
*01:32.280- 01:37.260* :  On order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the
*01:37.260- 01:42.360* :  next two days. We would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon
*01:42.360- 01:51.840* :  Hamas continuing to release hostages. Meanwhile, a BBC investigation reveals Hamas staged at least
*01:51.900- 01:57.840* :  four big training exercises at 14 sites to prepare for the October 7th massacre.
*01:58.440- 02:02.880* :  And the government of Sierra Leone blames renegade soldiers for a series of attacks in
*02:02.880- 02:05.780* :  free town on Sunday that left 20 people dead.
*02:09.100- 02:14.940* :  Also in this podcast, HIV infection rates fall significantly in South Africa but the
*02:14.940- 02:20.860* :  reason isn't clear. And it's beginning to drink a lot like Christmas.
*02:21.320- 02:24.380* :  The idea came really from what we've seen over the years in the bar.
*02:24.380- 02:27.660* :  We want people to feed something when the watch says video.
*02:28.220- 02:33.060* :  As a budget advert from an Irish pub, tugs at heartstrings around the world.
*02:36.560- 02:41.140* :  A four day pause in the fighting in Gaza has been extended until Wednesday.
*02:41.140- 02:47.160* :  It comes just today after the US President Joe Biden and other leaders called for an extension
*02:47.160- 02:51.540* :  to the truth between Israel and Hamas that have been broken by Qatar and Egypt.
*02:52.040- 02:57.160* :  So far, dozens of hostages who are captured by Hamas during their attack on October 7th
*02:57.440- 03:03.660* :  have been handed over to Israel. In exchange, Israel has released a total of 117 Palestinian
*03:03.660- 03:10.140* :  prisoners with a further 33 due to be freed. The latest extension was agreed once again by Qatar
*03:10.140- 03:15.000* :  where Hamas' political leaders are based with the help of the US and Egypt.
*03:15.480- 03:20.000* :  The White House National Security spokesperson, John Kirby, welcomed the decision.
*03:20.620- 03:24.820* :  The humanitarian pause has already brought a halt to the fighting together with a surge of humanitarian
*03:24.820- 03:30.360* :  assistance. Now, in order to extend the pause, Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women
*03:30.360- 03:35.280* :  and children over the next two days. We would, of course, hope to see the pause extended further.
*03:36.100- 03:38.900* :  And that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages.
*03:39.460- 03:43.920* :  News of the two-day truth extension has been broadly welcomed across the Middle East
*03:43.920- 03:48.920* :  and internationally. At a briefing with reporters, the Secretary General of the United Nations
*03:48.920- 03:54.700* :  Antonio Guterres said it was good news, but more time was needed to help Palestinians caught up
*03:54.700- 04:01.620* :  in the conflict. It's a glimpse of hope and humanity in the middle of the darkness of war.
*04:02.020- 04:07.740* :  And I strongly hope that these will enable us to increase even more the humanitarian aid
*04:07.740- 04:13.260* :  to the people in Gaza that is suffering so much. Just before recording this podcast,
*04:13.260- 04:17.140* :  I got the latest from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Lucy Williamson.
*04:17.700- 04:23.220* :  11 Israeli hostages have been released. We're now told they are back in Israel having medical
*04:23.220- 04:30.080* :  checks and will be taken to meet their families. We understand it's nine children and two adults.
*04:30.080- 04:36.220* :  The adults are mothers of some of the children and the children include a pair of three-year-old
*04:36.220- 04:43.640* :  twin girls. All the children have fathers who are still being held hostage in Gaza. It was just
*04:43.640- 04:48.820* :  the women and children who were released from those families and they all come from the same
*04:48.820- 04:55.000* :  community. Kibbutz near Oz, which was one of the worst-affected communities in the attacks of
*04:55.000- 05:01.020* :  7th October. So those men will have presumably had to wave goodbye to their own children as they
*05:01.020- 05:05.620* :  were released? Well, it's not known if they were being held together. One of the things we're
*05:05.620- 05:11.500* :  understanding is that not only are the hostages scattered probably around the Gaza Strip, but they're
*05:11.500- 05:17.080* :  also being held not just by Hamas but by other groups and factions as well. We don't know whether
*05:17.400- 05:21.880* :  the children were being held in the same place as their fathers, but the agreement that Israel
*05:21.880- 05:27.700* :  signed with Hamas stipulated that it would be civilians, women and children that were released
*05:27.700- 05:33.520* :  first and only after those were all out, then civilian men would be considered. And of course,
*05:33.520- 05:38.960* :  it was quite a complicated day-to-day because negotiations were going on simultaneously, not just
*05:38.960- 05:44.760* :  for today's exchange, but also to extend the current truce by another couple of days.
*05:45.000- 05:48.160* :  Yes, what do we know about that? We know that that's been agreed. So,
*05:48.160- 05:54.920* :  Qatar, which was a key part of the negotiations and the US as well as Hamas, have all said
*05:54.920- 06:00.240* :  the agreement has been reached to extend the truce by a couple of days. We don't have official
*06:00.240- 06:05.860* :  confirmation from Israel about that as yet, but they're not denying it. The thinking is that they
*06:05.860- 06:12.960* :  may be waiting for a list of hostages delivered to them by Hamas for tomorrow before officially
*06:12.960- 06:18.600* :  going ahead and publicly confirming that they have made that agreement. Lucy Williamson,
*06:19.340- 06:25.100* :  a BBC investigation has found that Hamas held at least four big training exercises at 14
*06:25.100- 06:30.440* :  sites across Gaza before it broke out of the Palestinian territory on the 7th of October,
*06:30.440- 06:37.020* :  massacring more than 1200 people in southern Israel. Propaganda videos analysed by BBC Arabic and
*06:37.020- 06:42.780* :  BBC Verify show it wasn't only Hamas which took part in the drills that started three years ago,
*06:43.160- 06:48.560* :  11 Palestinian groups were involved, five of which took part in the attacks alongside Hamas.
*06:48.900- 06:52.280* :  Our correspondent Caroline Hawley has been studying the evidence.
*06:57.740- 07:03.760* :  It's December 2020 and in a Hamas propaganda video, a mass man who calls himself Lion 2,
*07:04.320- 07:09.220* :  announces a joint military maneuver called Strong Pillar. It brought together Hamas,
*07:09.220- 07:15.360* :  Palestinian Islamic Jihad and several other groups and was the first of four major drills in which
*07:15.360- 07:21.000* :  tactics were rehearsed which were then used on October the 7th. The exercises took place in
*07:21.000- 07:29.420* :  December 2020, 2021, 2022 and then in September 2023, less than a month before the actual attack.
*07:34.860- 07:40.380* :  This is the sound of the maneuvers carried out at sites across Gaza when mock villages had been
*07:40.380- 07:47.220* :  set up completely even with a fake tank. Gunman practiced disabling tanks, taking hostages and
*07:47.220- 07:52.460* :  shooting as they went room to room through buildings. One of the sites used last December was less
*07:52.460- 07:58.800* :  than a mile from the fortified border with Israel and the drills were no secret. Videos of each one
*07:58.800- 08:04.180* :  of them were posted afterwards on the online messaging service telegram. So how was it that Israel
*08:04.180- 08:10.460* :  was caught off guard on October the 7th? Andreas Krieg is a security expert at King's College London.
*08:10.800- 08:15.580* :  This clear evidence for a strategic intelligence failure, you have the data in front of you but you're
*08:15.580- 08:20.180* :  not doing anything with it. You are feeling safe behind a fence where you spend billions of dollars
*08:20.520- 08:24.720* :  on it. You think the technology that you've invested into will keep you safe and the most important
*08:24.720- 08:28.580* :  thing is Israel thought they don't have to address the root cause of the crisis and the conflict.
*08:29.000- 08:33.280* :  Israel's military has responded saying it's focusing on eliminating the threat from Hamas
*08:33.700- 08:38.140* :  and that questions about any potential failures will be looked into at a later stage.
*08:38.920- 08:42.820* :  But with so many preparations for the attack having taken place in plain sight,
*08:43.460- 08:48.060* :  their questions that will haunt Israel for a very long time. Caroline Hawley.
*08:48.940- 08:54.700* :  A manhunt is underway in Sierra Leone after 19 people, including 13 soldiers, were killed in
*08:54.700- 09:00.760* :  coordinated attacks on military barracks and prisons on Sunday. A BBC reporter has visited
*09:00.760- 09:06.420* :  the central prison that was attacked and founded empty, suggesting more than 1800 inmates may
*09:06.420- 09:11.120* :  have escaped. The government says current and former servicemen were involved in the attacks.
*09:11.120- 09:15.900* :  Speaking from the central prison, the vice president, Ahamad Jules de Jallo,
*09:16.300- 09:21.780* :  said the situation was under control but concerning. Given the fact that this is a stable democracy,
*09:21.780- 09:27.060* :  this is a peaceful country for you to have a group of people to conniving with military officers
*09:27.060- 09:32.760* :  and civilians coming from outside of this country to go and attack the five Battalion Brigade,
*09:32.760- 09:38.940* :  attack the Amory, break open the Correctional Centers and allow prisoners to leave. This is worrying.
*09:39.360- 09:43.540* :  I got an update on what's happening from our West Africa correspondent, my own agents.
*09:43.580- 09:50.120* :  The situation isn't really clear. As you mentioned, current and former servicemen are involved.
*09:50.120- 09:53.980* :  That's what the government's been willing to see. But they haven't said much more than that,
*09:54.020- 09:59.420* :  and it's interesting because just a few months ago in August, they had issued a statement
*09:59.420- 10:05.040* :  and they arrested a number of armed officers for planning a coup at a time. So it's not clear
*10:05.700- 10:11.760* :  if this latest group is affiliated with that previous set of officers that were arrested in August
*10:11.900- 10:17.080* :  or whether they're completely separate. But I think one thing that is clear is that the government
*10:17.080- 10:21.300* :  is really keen to send a message that it's on top of things. And the fact that it's been
*10:21.380- 10:25.960* :  reluctant to call this a coup when back in August, it was very quick to call those
*10:26.560- 10:29.760* :  members of the armed forces that it had arrested to say that they were planning a coup.
*10:30.080- 10:34.300* :  I think suggest that they're trying to temper some of the conversation that's happening online,
*10:34.300- 10:39.200* :  that's pointing to perhaps political involvement behind all of this. None of it found that,
*10:39.200- 10:43.280* :  and I spoke to a representative of the opposition party today who said that, you know,
*10:43.280- 10:47.080* :  they strongly believe in maintaining the rule of law and constitutional order,
*10:47.540- 10:51.200* :  and that they would never sanction any kind of violent action against the government.
*10:51.760- 10:56.820* :  There seems to be something of a trend towards coups in West Africa at the moment.
*10:56.820- 10:59.120* :  Will the government of Sierra Leone be worried?
*10:59.380- 11:04.000* :  This is a country that has a long history of coups both during its 20-year civil war
*11:04.000- 11:09.720* :  as well as in the period before that. For the governments, they're trying to encourage members
*11:09.720- 11:13.380* :  of the diaspora to move back to Sierra Leone and invest in the country. They're trying to encourage
*11:13.380- 11:18.200* :  for an investment and it wants stability above anything else. And so the idea of a military
*11:18.200- 11:21.940* :  takeover right now is very frightening to them, and I think that's why they're kind of being
*11:21.940- 11:23.920* :  very cautious in the language that they're using.
*11:24.300- 11:31.240* :  Maynany Jones. Five years ago, 14% of South Africans were recorded as living with HIV.
*11:31.240- 11:38.100* :  Today, the figure has fallen to 12.7%. Researchers say it's the country's first significant fall,
*11:38.100- 11:43.520* :  so what is the reason? That is where the story becomes complicated because the team behind
*11:43.520- 11:49.080* :  the figures don't know the answer. Now, Africa, regional editor Richard Hamilton told us what
*11:49.080- 11:55.900* :  possible explanations there could be. The coronavirus pandemic had been a major health crisis
*11:55.900- 12:02.320* :  during the five years since the last survey into HIV, so it may be that people in South Africa
*12:02.320- 12:07.100* :  changed their behaviour. There were certainly alcohol bans, there was less contact, there was more
*12:07.100- 12:13.580* :  isolation, and then other studies have suggested that younger South Africans are more likely to use
*12:13.580- 12:21.460* :  condoms and engage in safe sex. Richard just reminded us just how bad the AIDS HIV crisis was
*12:21.460- 12:27.260* :  in South Africa at its worst point. Between the times that AIDS was first identified in the early
*12:27.260- 12:34.740* :  1980s, until now it's estimated that something like 40 million people died, and more than a third of
*12:34.740- 12:40.980* :  them were Africans, and South Africa was regarded as the epicenter. It had a devastating impact on
*12:41.580- 12:46.560* :  society. There was a whole generation of what were called AIDS orphans, and I was in South Africa
*12:46.560- 12:51.520* :  about 20 years ago, and the situation was out of control. It was like a raging fire that was
*12:51.800- 13:00.480* :  ripping through communities, and then in 2002 the treatment action campaign won a famous court case,
*13:00.520- 13:07.820* :  and this led to the rollout of anti-retroviral drugs, and HIV is no longer a death sentence because
*13:07.820- 13:14.760* :  of these anti-retroviral drugs. Richard Hamilton. The actress America Ferreira made headlines
*13:14.780- 13:20.420* :  early this year after her role in the Hollywood blockbuster Barbie when she delivered an impassioned
*13:20.420- 13:26.580* :  monologue about the pressure women face, whether she's on a film set or on the stage at a political
*13:26.580- 13:32.640* :  rally, actress producer and soon-to-be director Ferreira has built a career fighting against the labels
*13:32.640- 13:38.200* :  that everybody told her would hold her back. She's a role model for many Latinas in the US,
*13:38.200- 13:45.640* :  and now she's also one of the BBC's 100 Women named on our list for 2023, and she's been speaking
*13:45.640- 13:53.000* :  to the BBC's Beatrice de la Pava. For better or for worse, I was raised with the idea of the American
*13:53.000- 13:59.800* :  dream. I truly believed that if I had a dream and I was willing to work hard, then why wouldn't I
*13:59.800- 14:04.880* :  be able to achieve what I wanted to, and the more unlikely it seemed to the people around me,
*14:04.880- 14:11.200* :  the better the story, right? Americans love an underdog story, and it not to say that that wasn't
*14:11.540- 14:18.340* :  hard, it was really hard. You were the first ever Latina to win an Emmy Award for a leading role.
*14:18.380- 14:26.520* :  Why do you think it took until 2007 for a Latina to get there? Well, it's 2023, and I'm still the only,
*14:26.820- 14:34.420* :  which I think points exactly to the issue. It took so long because those opportunities don't
*14:34.420- 14:40.080* :  exist. There was a really devastating new research that just came out of the Annenberg Center,
*14:40.540- 14:48.760* :  which says that based on the data representation has not changed for Latinos in the media for 16
*14:48.760- 14:59.400* :  years, and so it's complicated to reconcile the almost fairy tale story of my journey with what I
*14:59.400- 15:06.540* :  know is the reality for the vast majority of people like me. Several of the characters you've
*15:06.580- 15:14.760* :  played capture the anger and the frustration at unrealistic expectations of women. How much of
*15:14.760- 15:21.960* :  your own human experience have you seen reflected in those epic monologues? Part of the catharsis
*15:22.000- 15:28.840* :  of getting to watch our own experiences reflected back at us is how invisible those experiences
*15:28.840- 15:35.900* :  feel when they're not reflected back to us. So many of us underrepresented communities are still
*15:35.900- 15:41.900* :  just fighting to be visible. Everybody who wants it can just make the choice to hire more women
*15:41.900- 15:47.560* :  and people of color and support with your money and not just with your words, the work of women
*15:47.560- 15:54.000* :  and people of color. And so it's not magic, really, but it isn't about charity. It's about good
*15:54.140- 15:59.040* :  business. I wouldn't be mad if I never had to do another diversity panel, and if they took all
*15:59.040- 16:05.280* :  that money and just used it to really fund women and people of color. America Ferreira speaking to
*16:05.280- 16:13.740* :  Beatriz de la Pava. Still to come in the Global News podcast, could the most endangered
*16:13.740- 16:20.600* :  rhino on earth be making a comeback in Sumatra? This is the second calf that's been born in two
*16:20.600- 16:25.780* :  months. It's quite remarkable to think these two births over the last two months represent a
*16:25.780- 16:38.760* :  five percent increase in the global population. Let's return to our top story. There's relief
*16:38.760- 16:44.040* :  for some families whose relatives are still being held in Gaza, as well as Palestinians in
*16:44.040- 16:49.800* :  Israeli jails. We're now on the fourth day of hostages being freed in exchange for Palestinian
*16:49.800- 16:55.160* :  prisoners. And as you heard, Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend the pause for another two
*16:55.160- 17:01.960* :  days. 11 hostages arrived in Israel. Israel says more than 150 hostages remain in Gaza.
*17:02.500- 17:08.660* :  As with previous days, Palestinian prisoners are being freed 33 on Monday. But Mark Regev,
*17:08.660- 17:13.340* :  a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister, said that he didn't trust Hamas.
*17:13.820- 17:18.400* :  We're dealing with a ruthless and fanatical terror organization. And just tonight in the people
*17:18.400- 17:24.780* :  released, I've received the list. There are two three-year-old twins. Who kidnaps three-year-olds?
*17:25.020- 17:30.760* :  Only a brutal, ruthless terrorist organization. But as President Biden said on Friday, he said,
*17:30.760- 17:37.740* :  Hamas understands one thing, and that's pressure. In Gaza, where more than 15,000 Palestinians have
*17:37.740- 17:42.800* :  been killed since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, the pause in the
*17:42.800- 17:48.560* :  fighting has brought some respite from Israel's relentless bombing and ground war. More aid has
*17:48.560- 17:53.620* :  been allowed into the territory. And for Ali Mahdi, it's been a chance to recover the bodies
*17:53.620- 18:00.980* :  of two of his relatives. My father and my nephew were martyred 14 days ago. When the
*18:00.980- 18:07.000* :  truth came, I was able to move my father's body and bury him at my house. What did we do?
*18:07.680- 18:11.880* :  We are neither Hamas nor Fatah, and we've never held a weapon in our lives.
*18:12.460- 18:17.180* :  Many Arab leaders and other nations would like to see this temporary pause in fighting become
*18:17.180- 18:22.300* :  something more long-lasting. Indeed, some countries have openly called for a ceasefire.
*18:22.480- 18:26.640* :  But crucial to the last four days of peace has been the role played by the International
*18:26.640- 18:32.380* :  Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC has a long history of visiting prisoners of war and
*18:32.380- 18:37.620* :  detainees, and in prisoner exchanges. But this operation has been particularly fraught.
*18:37.940- 18:44.640* :  Geneva correspondent Imogen Fokes spoke to Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's director for the Middle East,
*18:45.160- 18:50.420* :  who explained why establishing trust with the warring sides is key to supporting a prisoner
*18:50.420- 18:56.160* :  or hostage exchange. We don't need to like them. We don't need to agree with them. We just need
*18:56.160- 19:02.700* :  to agree that we hear only for a humanitarian objective, and often a very humble humanitarian
*19:02.700- 19:09.180* :  objective. We want comments on the political situation, and so we built this trust, and that's
*19:09.180- 19:15.640* :  what allows us when there is a release of hostages to be on the battlefield, to get out in the middle
*19:15.640- 19:24.060* :  of the night, go to a secret place, receive hostages, and at the same time make sure that the same
*19:24.060- 19:31.280* :  thing happens pretty much at the same time with Palestinian detainees. To do that with parties
*19:32.160- 19:37.080* :  who don't trust each other, who actually want to kill each other in situation of conflict,
*19:37.740- 19:45.820* :  and be this third party, all party trust is extremely difficult. You don't do that overnight,
*19:45.820- 19:52.140* :  you build this. There has been some criticism particularly from Israel that you didn't or couldn't
*19:52.140- 19:58.260* :  actually visit these hostages in all these 50 odd days. When families are telling us this,
*19:58.960- 20:05.760* :  I understand. I see a sea, we have a history, we present in many conflicts, we have staff doing
*20:05.760- 20:11.800* :  unbelievable job all around the world, and in this kind of situation where it's sometimes desperate,
*20:12.560- 20:20.260* :  we probably, to some extent, victim of our image, and people tend to believe that we can do things,
*20:20.300- 20:27.540* :  we actually, we can't. We have no army, we have no weapons, even a political weight,
*20:27.540- 20:33.860* :  that could force party to do something they don't want to do. The only thing we have, it's our
*20:33.860- 20:40.180* :  capacity to be consistent, to engage with everybody. If we go back now to the situation of the hostages,
*20:40.740- 20:46.920* :  after a couple of hours, we were already very clear that it was illegal that people needed to be
*20:46.920- 20:53.940* :  released immediately, that we were available to visit people wherever they were, and that we
*20:53.940- 20:59.940* :  demand proof of life. Now the specificity of Gaza, it's a battlefield. The colleagues who
*20:59.940- 21:04.940* :  doing this, they are the colleagues who are in Gaza. Three days ago, we had again a colleague killed
*21:04.940- 21:11.860* :  with his family, all of them were displaced, they've lost their houses, many are Palestinians,
*21:11.980- 21:18.860* :  nevertheless, if they need to do something to work for the release of hostages, for prisoners,
*21:18.860- 21:26.660* :  for whoever, they'll do it. You know, we sent in Gaza our best staff, the most experienced staff.
*21:27.280- 21:34.000* :  We also send our surgical team, ICC surgeon, ICC medical staff, they really have seen a lot.
*21:34.040- 21:38.360* :  They've been in Afghanistan, they've been in Sudan, they've been on front line in Yemen,
*21:38.360- 21:45.740* :  but they're in Gaza, it's really tough. The number of wounded is enormous because of the nature
*21:45.780- 21:52.760* :  of the violence, a lot of burns, a lot of kids. Honestly, I'm not sure we take the full measure
*21:52.760- 22:00.600* :  of what's happening there. Fabrizio Carboni speaking to Imogen Fakes. A large international study
*22:00.600- 22:05.280* :  has failed to find a definitive link between the internet and mental health,
*22:05.620- 22:09.740* :  this applied to all age groups. With more details, here's Sasha Slikda.
*22:10.460- 22:16.260* :  The study involved two million people aged 15 to 90, from nearly 170 countries.
*22:16.260- 22:22.640* :  Its conclusion, the internet and mobile phones may not have a blanket negative effect on well-being
*22:22.640- 22:27.720* :  and mental health. The lead Oxford researcher said, we looked very hard for a smoking gun,
*22:27.720- 22:33.800* :  linking technology and well-being, and we didn't find it. However, the study did not look at
*22:33.800- 22:39.620* :  social media use, and with young people did not take into account how long they spent online.
*22:40.260- 22:46.380* :  But looking over two decades, the study found that live satisfaction increased more for females.
*22:47.240- 22:52.340* :  Also, the researchers encountered reluctance on the part of technology companies to share data.
*22:52.540- 22:56.980* :  They say they'd need to be more transparent if there is to be conclusive evidence of the
*22:56.980- 22:59.780* :  impacts of internet use. Sasha Slikda.
*23:00.860- 23:06.260* :  Police in Ecuador, so they've made a high-profile arrest, the alleged leader of Los Lobos,
*23:06.260- 23:10.620* :  or the wolves, a criminal organisation that has grown in power in recent years.
*23:10.940- 23:15.520* :  The group specialises in drug trafficking and has links to cartels in Mexico,
*23:16.060- 23:21.080* :  our online editor for Latin America, Vanessa Bush-Luter, told me more about the group.
*23:22.000- 23:28.140* :  Los Lobos is a very serious problem in Ecuador. Many of its members are actually behind bars,
*23:28.640- 23:35.720* :  but they have built up a empire inside the jails. They control many of the country's penitentiaries,
*23:36.260- 23:43.440* :  and they manage to even order murders and drug trafficking deals from behind bars,
*23:43.440- 23:50.640* :  everything from extortion, drug dealing, murders for money. So the hitmen, what is important
*23:50.640- 23:56.260* :  about this arrest in particular is that it was carried out in a city called Puerto Bolívar.
*23:56.260- 24:02.300* :  It's a port city on the Pacific coast of Ecuador, and it is one of the ports where
*24:03.040- 24:09.480* :  80% of the banana shipments from Ecuador are channels through. And banana shipments have become
*24:09.480- 24:17.480* :  one of the main ways that these gangs smuggle cocaine from Ecuador to the US and to Europe.
*24:17.800- 24:21.900* :  So they hide their cocaine shipment within the banana shipments.
*24:22.160- 24:26.480* :  The trouble is though, when you arrest the leader of a criminal organization all too often,
*24:26.480- 24:30.640* :  all that happens is the next one down just steps up and takes control, nothing really changes.
*24:31.040- 24:35.960* :  That's absolutely right, and that's happened with this gang Los Lobos before. One of their leaders
*24:35.960- 24:42.160* :  was detained, and he was just replaced by others, and it's quite often quite difficult to keep up
*24:42.600- 24:48.600* :  with who is actually pulling the strings. As I mentioned before, even when people are arrested,
*24:48.600- 24:52.700* :  they quite often continue to exert their influence from behind bars.
*24:53.140- 24:54.320* :  Vanessa Bouchluta
*24:55.480- 25:01.620* :  Officials in Indonesia have announced the birth of a Sumatraan rhino, the most endangered species
*25:01.620- 25:07.280* :  of rhinoceros. It's thought there may be just a few dozen animals left. The male calf was born
*25:07.280- 25:13.880* :  in way Cambus National Park in Sumatra to a captive-born mother. John Taylor runs the UK
*25:13.880- 25:19.960* :  based charity Save the Rhino International. Tim Franks asked John what's special about
*25:19.960- 25:25.540* :  Sumatraan rhinos. They're the closest living relatives of the woolly rhinos that used to wander
*25:25.540- 25:31.440* :  around Europe. They are small, brown, hairy. They're solitary animals who live in the dense forest
*25:31.440- 25:36.900* :  and used to live right across Asia, but now they only live in Sumatra. And they sing to each other
*25:37.200- 25:42.480* :  because they live alone in the forests, they sing to try and find other rhinos when they want to
*25:42.480- 25:49.200* :  meet up and breed. Absolutely marvelous. Do these singing captivity as well? They do.
*25:49.640- 25:53.320* :  We have some lovely recordings of one or two of the captive rhinos having a wash in the
*25:53.320- 25:59.120* :  mornings and singing happens as they get washed. The main threat now to Sumatraan rhinos
*25:59.400- 26:05.960* :  is that they have been driven into smaller fragmented pockets of forest that they are so isolated
*26:05.980- 26:11.700* :  that it's almost impossible for them to meet other rhinos and to breed. It's very sad to think of
*26:11.700- 26:16.600* :  them singing in the forest and nobody there to hear the song. So the government of Indonesia is
*26:16.600- 26:22.020* :  leading a global effort where possible to bring these rhinos out of the forest to bring them into
*26:22.020- 26:26.900* :  safe places and there's an amazing sanctuary in the south of Sumatra that now has an incredibly
*26:26.900- 26:33.660* :  expert team. They're now looking after 10 rhinos in semi-wild conditions and giving them a chance
*26:33.800- 26:38.800* :  to come together with other rhinos and to breed as they would in the wild. And this is the second
*26:38.800- 26:45.360* :  calf that's been born in two months that is absolutely extraordinary. It's quite remarkable to
*26:45.360- 26:50.560* :  think these two births over the last two months represent a five percent increase in the global
*26:50.560- 26:55.940* :  population. And is the plan to try and get the habitats into which they might then be released
*26:56.020- 27:01.800* :  return to some sort of fit state for them? Absolutely. We're working at the moment with a
*27:01.800- 27:07.220* :  restoration project around the park in which the sanctuary is located to work with local communities
*27:07.220- 27:12.480* :  to actually restore habitat there that has been eroded away by human activity. But yes,
*27:12.540- 27:17.000* :  it's absolutely essential to be restoring the habitat and protecting the habitat. There's
*27:17.000- 27:22.260* :  other amazing animals in there, Sumatra and Elephants and Tigers. They need protecting and eventually
*27:22.260- 27:26.640* :  that will be the safe place to which we can return Sumatra and rhinos once their numbers are up.
*27:27.020- 27:33.680* :  John Taylor of Save the Rhino International. And if you're wondering what a singing Sumatra
*27:33.680- 27:38.340* :  and Rhino sounds like, here's the new calf's mother, Delilah, in full song.
*27:47.800- 27:53.880* :  A budget festive advert for a pub in Northern Ireland is con viral prompting Charlies bar,
*27:53.880- 27:59.860* :  a small traditional pub onto the world stage. The video showing a lonely old man who finds
*27:59.860- 28:04.780* :  solace in the pub has been viewed millions of times across social media platforms with the
*28:04.780- 28:10.540* :  caption, there are no strangers here, only friends who haven't met yet. Our island correspondent
*28:10.540- 28:21.240* :  Chris Page has been watching. The ad for Charlies bar is rapidly becoming a festive classic
*28:21.240- 28:28.440* :  with themes of isolation and companionship. It begins with an elderly man visiting a cemetery.
*28:29.020- 28:33.840* :  He tries, unsuccessfully, to strike up conversation with people in the time center.
*28:34.540- 28:39.400* :  When he pops into the pub, a dog called Missy comes to him with teal wagging.
*28:39.920- 28:45.560* :  Missy's young owners then buy him a drink, smiles break out and glasses are clinked together.
*28:47.220- 28:52.300* :  The manager of Charlies, Rina Burns, said she wanted to tell a story which she could imagine
*28:52.300- 28:57.480* :  unfolding in her pub. The idea came really from what we've seen over the years in the bar.
*28:57.680- 29:00.940* :  It didn't seem very groundbreaking at the time. It's a very simple message.
*29:01.440- 29:06.580* :  We want people to feel something when they watch this video and to get across the idea that
*29:06.820- 29:11.400* :  unfortunate Christmas isn't as positive and joyful for some as it is for others.
*29:12.240- 29:17.600* :  The production which cost less than $900 is rivaling the big retailers seasonal
*29:17.600- 29:24.100* :  apex for numbers of views. The festivities in Fermanna have started in a way no one else expected.
*29:24.820- 29:30.460* :  For weeks time on Christmas Day, the bar staff were expecting people who have no one else at home
*29:30.900- 29:33.680* :  to come in for some warm bar side chats.
*29:39.680- 29:46.020* :  Chris Page and finally let's go back to the second world war and the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz.
*29:46.120- 29:50.100* :  As prisoners there were being marched to work, they would leave the camp hearing music
*29:50.100- 29:55.180* :  performed by other inmates who were forced by their Nazi captors to form orchestras
*29:55.680- 29:59.260* :  more than one million people. Most of them Jews were murdered there.
*29:59.500- 30:05.460* :  Well, for the first time, music written by prisoners in Auschwitz and found at the camp in Poland
*30:05.460- 30:11.000* :  has been performed in London. The British composer Leo Gaia spent the past seven years
*30:11.000- 30:16.620* :  piecing scraps and fragments together to create some playable scores. He's been speaking to my
*30:16.620- 30:22.000* :  colleague Sarah Montague. Of course, I knew about the auctions of Auschwitz and I then had a
*30:22.000- 30:27.160* :  conversation with one of the archives this and he mentioned in quite an offhand way. Oh yes,
*30:27.160- 30:30.900* :  well, there's the manuscript in the archives, but I'm sure you're not interested in those.
*30:31.140- 30:34.460* :  And of course, I nearly fell over when he told me because I couldn't believe that such a thing
*30:34.460- 30:40.660* :  existed. There's 210 pieces of music in total, but none of them are complete. So it's the
*30:40.660- 30:45.960* :  equivalent of several hundred jigsaw puzzles, but all the pieces many are missing, some are
*30:45.960- 30:51.140* :  damaged, and so it requires some serious music detective work to try and piece them together,
*30:51.140- 30:56.320* :  and in many cases sensitively recomposed music to fill the gaps. How much was there?
*30:56.680- 31:01.340* :  I think one of the best pieces to describe is the one that really set me on this course,
*31:01.640- 31:06.240* :  and it's a piece that has the title Darym and Jale, which is Polish and translates roughly as
*31:16.680- 31:22.060* :  futile regret. And it's an unsigned, unfinished, compositional sketch, as you might guess from
*31:22.060- 31:28.060* :  the title, it is racked with grief, but because of that is that it seems impossible that it was
*31:28.060- 31:33.000* :  ever allowed to be performed in Auschwitz, but the most haunting thing for me was that I noticed
*31:33.000- 31:38.620* :  that the handwriting was identical to mine, so I felt it was my duty to finish it.
*31:38.960- 31:44.360* :  Now you say it was unlikely to be have been performed in Auschwitz, and that was because more
*31:44.360- 31:50.080* :  typically the kind of music they were forced to play was much more upbeat. Exactly, yes, so the
*31:50.080- 31:56.640* :  orchestras were formed by prisoners, but commissioned by the SS, and the idea was for the orchestras to
*31:56.640- 32:12.720* :  principally play marching music. And this would enable the prisoners to march swiftly,
*32:12.720- 32:18.580* :  and they would also play on the return when, tragically, the prisoners many would be carrying the dead.
*32:18.860- 32:24.260* :  We'd also know that there were lots of other musical events that took place, and some of even
*32:24.260- 32:29.400* :  the public performances, there was hidden musical messages within the music. One, for example,
*32:37.700- 32:41.660* :  was the Polish National Anthem. Absolutely, yes, so musicians very cunningly and very cleverly
*32:41.900- 32:47.900* :  managed to weave in this melody into some of the music, which of course was not picked up by the
*32:47.920- 32:51.880* :  soldiers, but for any Polish prisoners they would have heard of that, and that would have given them
*32:51.880- 32:57.400* :  great strength and courage. It's fair to say that this music is distressing, and it's alarming.
*32:57.400- 33:01.960* :  Certainly in the case of some of this light Germanic music that we're playing, which has
*33:02.160- 33:06.300* :  principally been forgotten, perhaps for a good reason, really, because some of these composers
*33:06.300- 33:12.620* :  were very much affiliated with the Nazis. It's very difficult not to be drawn into thinking about
*33:12.620- 33:17.100* :  how this music was written and performed at that time. I don't think I'd be able to do this
*33:17.200- 33:21.880* :  performance if I hadn't very recently welcomed my daughter into the world, so to be able to
*33:22.200- 33:26.320* :  think about new life in the context of death makes it possible.
*33:32.180- 33:35.100* :  Leo Gaia speaking to Serumontigue.
*33:38.340- 33:43.140* :  And that's all from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast.
