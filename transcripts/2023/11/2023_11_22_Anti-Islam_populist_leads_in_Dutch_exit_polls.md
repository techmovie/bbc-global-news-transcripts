*00:31.280- 00:34.360* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:37.240- 00:42.020* :  I'm Janet Gillil, and in the early hours of Thursday the 23rd of November, these are our main
*00:42.020- 00:47.320* :  stories. Exit polls from the Dutch Parliamentary elections put the party led by the anti-immigrant
*00:47.320- 00:53.700* :  populist, pit-filters well ahead of its rivals. Relatives of the hostages held in Gaza wait to see
*00:53.700- 00:59.540* :  who could be freed in the coming days. Rescue workers drilling to free more than 40 workers
*00:59.540- 01:03.860* :  trapped under a collapsed tunnel in India say they're close to getting them out.
*01:06.840- 01:13.600* :  Also in this podcast, he said to me there's been an accident and I don't know how to tell you
*01:13.600- 01:18.040* :  this, but your husband's dad. How do we make film sets safer and?
*01:23.240- 01:27.220* :  Why Britain's King Charles is engaged in K-pop diplomacy?
*01:32.520- 01:37.660* :  In what could be a big political upset, exit polls in the Netherlands suggest that voters in
*01:37.660- 01:43.560* :  Wednesday's Parliamentary elections have lurched sharply to the right. According to those exit polls,
*01:43.560- 01:49.560* :  the party of the anti-immigrant populist, hit-filters, has won the most seats, which in theory
*01:49.560- 01:55.540* :  means he could head a coalition as Prime Minister. This was after a campaign in which he toned down
*01:55.540- 02:01.080* :  his anti-Islam rhetoric, but it's not clear he'll be able to form a government as we heard from
*02:01.080- 02:07.600* :  Anna Holligan in the hake. We've had two sets of exit polls. Both of them suggest that
*02:07.600- 02:12.420* :  Geertvilder's Freedom Party is indeed the largest party and what that means is not necessarily
*02:12.420- 02:17.900* :  that he will be the next Prime Minister of the Netherlands, but that he will be given the first
*02:17.900- 02:23.920* :  opportunity to try to form a coalition government and we have had an indication from him already.
*02:23.920- 02:30.620* :  He has made a victory speech and he appears to be reaching out to the other parties signalling
*02:30.620- 02:37.160* :  he's prepared to compromise. He wants to control the tsunami of asylum within the limits
*02:37.160- 02:44.940* :  of the constitution. I'm just outside the VVD-liberal conservative centre-right party,
*02:44.940- 02:51.720* :  party, although watching people inside and listening to their size, they're drowning their
*02:51.720- 02:56.260* :  source now because actually, Dylan Yisilgog, their leader who took over from Marcarossa,
*02:56.940- 03:01.460* :  was widely tipped to be the first ever female Prime Minister of the Netherlands and these exit
*03:01.460- 03:10.520* :  polls suggest that is looking much less likely to be the case. Even if Geertvilder fails to
*03:10.520- 03:16.880* :  convince enough other parties to join him in a governing coalition, if the other parties refuse
*03:16.880- 03:22.500* :  to do that, they will be accused of failing to listen to the voice of the people when such a
*03:22.500- 03:27.520* :  significant portion of the population have voted for this man. In the context of Brussels,
*03:27.520- 03:35.620* :  bear in mind, in his manifesto, he has offered the possibility of an exit, a Brexit referendum
*03:35.620- 03:42.140* :  for the Netherlands. He wants to take the party out of the EU. He says the majority of
*03:42.580- 03:47.640* :  his supporters want to leave the EU. Having said that, when I spoke to him when he was casting
*03:47.640- 03:53.680* :  his vote this morning, when I spoke to him after the final TV debate last night, he was trying to
*03:53.680- 03:59.900* :  reassure people in this country and beyond that he was prepared to be a Prime Minister for the
*03:59.900- 04:05.440* :  entire country if he is, indeed, given the opportunity. So what happens now? We should get the
*04:05.780- 04:13.680* :  final results on Thursday, and from that point on, the more complicated than anyone had expected,
*04:14.100- 04:18.800* :  probably, a process of trying to form a new governing coalition will begin.
*04:19.480- 04:24.640* :  Anna Holligan, for weeks the families of the hostages in Gaza have endured an agonising
*04:24.640- 04:30.880* :  wait to see if their loved ones will be freed. Now for some, the nightmare may be ending under the
*04:30.880- 04:37.160* :  terms of a deal where Hamas is due to soon start releasing 50 women and children in return for
*04:37.160- 04:43.960* :  150 Palestinian women and children being freed from Israeli prisons, a four-day pause in the
*04:43.960- 04:50.860* :  fighting and an influx of aid, including fuel in Gaza. He did OL's son Elon was taken hostage by
*04:50.860- 04:57.420* :  Hamas on October 7th. She explained why talking about her son was so important. The most important
*04:57.420- 05:04.340* :  thing for a mother, for all mothers, is that their son is known and it's not just another number.
*05:04.340- 05:12.240* :  It's like 236 people. We have to remember that each one has a life, each one has a name,
*05:12.680- 05:19.000* :  each one has a family, you know, behind them. It's not just a number. For me talking to you
*05:19.180- 05:26.900* :  makes them be more real. There is a story behind it, you know, and that makes it very important that
*05:26.900- 05:33.260* :  everybody in the world will know that. The Hamas run health authorities in Gaza say Israel's
*05:33.260- 05:39.720* :  air and ground assault, which is still ongoing, has now killed more than 14,000 people, most of them
*05:39.720- 05:45.120* :  women or children. The Deseret plight of Gaza's children was highlighted at the UN Security Council
*05:45.120- 05:51.400* :  by the Children's Agency UNICEF amid concerns that the four-day truce is too short to help many of
*05:51.400- 05:57.680* :  them. Their spokesperson is Catherine Russell. More than 5,300 Palestinian children have been
*05:57.680- 06:06.200* :  reportedly killed in just 46 days, over 115 a day, every day, for weeks and weeks. Based on these
*06:06.200- 06:12.840* :  figures, children account for 40 percent of the deaths in Gaza. This is unprecedented. In other
*06:12.840- 06:17.920* :  words, today, the Gaza Strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.
*06:18.800- 06:22.320* :  Even as the clock counts down to this expected hostage and prisoner exchange,
*06:22.320- 06:26.300* :  dozens more Palestinians have been reported killed in the latest fighting.
*06:26.880- 06:30.880* :  There's confusion over whether the Red Cross will be allowed to visit the hostages still
*06:30.880- 06:36.480* :  left in Gaza. After the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they would, but they
*06:36.480- 06:41.680* :  said they hadn't received any information about this. Our Jerusalem correspondent Tom Bateman
*06:41.680- 06:46.280* :  told us more about the preparations. What we're hearing in the Israeli media tonight is
*06:46.760- 06:52.640* :  one key part of the choreography ahead of this expected deal to be implemented tomorrow is that
*06:53.200- 07:00.160* :  in Qatar, tonight, the head of Mossad is expected to receive a list of the hostages, the first
*07:00.160- 07:06.980* :  batch of hostages, to be released, which is said to happen at midday tomorrow, local time.
*07:07.440- 07:12.000* :  Now, this is important because that will be the first indication, obviously, to the Israelis,
*07:12.000- 07:18.940* :  about which hostages Hamas intends to hand over to the Red Cross to then be taken to the Raffa
*07:18.940- 07:27.520* :  Crossing and to be brought to the Israeli liaison point. Now, the Israeli media reports are that
*07:27.520- 07:31.660* :  the families wouldn't be told about who's on those lists, and in fact, they wouldn't be told
*07:31.660- 07:38.940* :  anything until the first batch of hostages have been handed to the Israelis. And we've just had
*07:38.940- 07:43.860* :  Daniel Hagarri, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, talking, but suggesting that
*07:44.180- 07:49.080* :  they don't have an absolute, or he wouldn't talk about a confirmed time for the start of the cease
*07:49.080- 07:55.840* :  fire. Now, our understanding earlier was that the time that was being talked about was 10 o'clock
*07:55.840- 08:00.940* :  local time tomorrow morning, and you would then have the first batch of hostages released from
*08:00.940- 08:07.400* :  noon. So, you know, two hours presumably to verify that a cease fire is holding before the
*08:07.400- 08:12.600* :  first hostages were released, and then Israel would release three times the number of Palestinian
*08:12.600- 08:18.380* :  prisoners. So, if 10 Israeli hostages were to be released around 30, Palestinian prisoners would
*08:18.380- 08:24.300* :  then be released by Israel. But the sense we got from Daniel Hagarri, the military spokesman,
*08:24.300- 08:29.500* :  is that, you know, things still feel quite tentative. The lack of clarity about, you know,
*08:29.500- 08:35.320* :  all of the pieces falling into place, they're in unprecedented circumstances trying to do a hostage
*08:35.320- 08:44.120* :  or prisoner exchange with this number of people during, you know, this war, this level of fighting,
*08:44.680- 08:48.900* :  nothing like that has ever been done between Israel and its adversaries before.
*08:49.800- 08:54.400* :  Tom Bateman in Jerusalem, and since we spoke to Tom, the office of the Israeli Prime Minister has
*08:54.400- 09:02.440* :  put out a statement saying the release of the hostages will not be before Friday. Clearly, as Tom
*09:02.440- 09:09.360* :  said, things are still very tentative. As we record this podcast, rescue workers drilling to free
*09:09.360- 09:14.320* :  more than 40 men who've been trapped under a collapsed tunnel in India for days say they're
*09:14.320- 09:20.620* :  close to a breakthrough. Engineers are driving a steel pipe through tons of earth concrete and
*09:20.620- 09:25.700* :  rubble to reach the men. Rescue efforts have been complicated by drilling machines breaking down
*09:25.700- 09:31.260* :  and work was suspended on Friday after a cracking sound raised fears of another collapse.
*09:31.260- 09:37.600* :  Samira Hussein is at the scene. I'm actually standing about 100 meters away from the mouth of
*09:37.600- 09:43.920* :  the tunnel, and if you can hear that worrying behind me, what they have been doing is drilling a
*09:44.000- 09:50.200* :  hole through the front of the tunnel, going through the rubble and debris to try and reach the
*09:50.200- 09:58.080* :  men. Now, earlier rescue attempts had been hit by some machine difficulties, so two machines
*09:58.080- 10:03.100* :  had already broken down. Now, this third drilling machine that they have, rescue officials say
*10:03.180- 10:09.080* :  they're actually making really good progress that they've already gone through about 45 meters of
*10:09.080- 10:15.580* :  debris, and that was a few hours ago, and they have about 57 meters of debris before they reach
*10:15.580- 10:21.420* :  the trapped workers. And are they planning to work through the night? Absolutely. In fact,
*10:21.540- 10:26.440* :  this new drilling machine, as soon as they got it up and running, they started drilling right away,
*10:26.440- 10:32.140* :  so that was at 2 a.m., and they're still drilling. There's no sense that they're going to be stopping
*10:32.700- 10:37.200* :  anytime soon. I'm what about the men? What do we know about their condition? Because we did see those
*10:37.200- 10:42.720* :  first pictures of them a couple of days ago. Interestingly, I actually spoke with one gentleman who
*10:42.720- 10:49.560* :  is here. His cousin is in the tunnel, and he has been here for the last week or so, and he said
*10:49.560- 10:55.040* :  that he spoke to his cousin, and his cousin said, don't worry, we're doing okay. And officials have
*10:55.040- 10:59.820* :  been maintaining the same thing in terms of the health of the men that are inside that they're
*10:59.820- 11:05.540* :  still doing well, and on that video you heard them asking, is everyone okay in doing a roll call
*11:05.540- 11:11.660* :  and assuring them that they will be rescued? That said, they have brought in quite a few ambulances,
*11:11.660- 11:18.740* :  there are four ambulances that are inside the tunnel waiting for the rescue to help any men that
*11:18.800- 11:24.800* :  may need it. Because they've been trapped for 11 days, it's very cold at night there, and they've
*11:24.800- 11:29.560* :  only just recently started getting hot food. To give you a sense of just how cold it is, it's
*11:29.560- 11:37.780* :  in the single digits, I am wearing two coats, a hat and a scarf, and if I am so cold out here,
*11:37.780- 11:43.920* :  I can only just imagine what it is like for the men that have been underground for so long.
*11:44.360- 11:51.180* :  Yes, they are receiving cooked food now, they have access to water, and the space that they're in
*11:51.180- 11:58.380* :  is about two kilometers wide, so they are able to walk around, but it's still quite cold, especially
*11:58.860- 12:04.360* :  at night. And some of the relatives are unhappy that it's taken this long to even get this close.
*12:05.100- 12:11.100* :  Absolutely, I think because there were so many failed attempts at the very beginning, many family
*12:11.100- 12:16.900* :  members and friends that had gathered here were really quite frustrated that it was taking so
*12:16.900- 12:23.460* :  long to get them in, there weren't other plans being made, but now there's a sense among some
*12:23.460- 12:29.160* :  family members that they're being provided with somewhere to stay as they wait for their loved ones,
*12:29.160- 12:33.940* :  they're being provided with food and they're being provided with a little bit more information
*12:33.940- 12:40.460* :  than they had been before. Samira Hussein in the Indian State of Uttarakhand. The United States says
*12:40.460- 12:46.900* :  it's treating the reported plot to kill a Sikh separatist on U.S. soil with the utmost seriousness,
*12:46.900- 12:52.120* :  and it says it's raised the issue with the Indian government. A White House spokesperson woman
*12:52.120- 12:57.140* :  said Delhi had expressed surprise and concern at the reports and had begun an investigation.
*12:57.140- 13:03.620* :  Gary O'Donohu has more details. Group At Once Singh Panon is a New York-based lawyer for Sikhs
*13:03.620- 13:08.600* :  for Justice, a separatist group that calls for an independent Sikh homeland within India.
*13:09.200- 13:14.240* :  He's declined to comment on the alleged plot, but a spokesman for the National Security Council,
*13:14.240- 13:19.760* :  Adrian Watson, said the U.S. had conveyed the expectation that anyone deemed responsible
*13:19.760- 13:24.980* :  should be held accountable. There are also reports that at least one individual
*13:25.400- 13:29.080* :  has been indicted in the case, but details have not been made public.
*13:30.080- 13:39.780* :  Gary O'Donohu. Still to come? Absolutely he lived frugally. He wouldn't buy anything for himself
*13:39.780- 13:46.600* :  unless he absolutely had to. A small U.S. town gets a surprise from a secret millionaire.
*13:52.600- 13:58.120* :  Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Britain has been engaged in K-pop diplomacy this week.
*13:58.460- 14:03.860* :  On Tuesday night, King Charles hosted the South Korean President at a lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace.
*14:04.520- 14:08.260* :  The King admitted to a personal lack of what might be called Gangnam style,
*14:08.580- 14:13.880* :  but the military banned for the changing of the guard put that right on Wednesday.
*14:19.580- 14:24.040* :  And the King presented the four members of Black Pink, the South Korean girl group with
*14:24.040- 14:29.920* :  honorary MBEs, while President Young-Sung-Yul looked on. I asked our raw correspondent,
*14:29.920- 14:33.840* :  Sean Cochlin, why the King was handing out these honors to the pop group.
*14:34.460- 14:38.560* :  The answer given by them is because of their environmental campaigning. They worked with the
*14:38.560- 14:43.780* :  K-pop climate summit, and they've been ambassadors for the UN as well. And climate changes an
*14:43.780- 14:47.600* :  issue dear to King Charles Hart? That's right. And they're seen in Papsars and Avenue towards young
*14:47.600- 14:51.220* :  people, and it's a reference to the millions of young people they can connect with their music.
*14:51.660- 14:56.220* :  But I think underlying this is this sort of diplomatic courtship that's going on, and I think
*14:56.220- 15:02.760* :  King Charles wants to try to turn this state into more than the usual set of banquets and ceremonial
*15:02.760- 15:06.920* :  occasions. Try and make it a bit lighter, but also make sure that everyone knows that he's
*15:06.920- 15:12.200* :  taking South Korea seriously. He respects their culture. He went to the biggest concentration of
*15:12.200- 15:17.560* :  Koreans in Europe in New Maldon a couple of weeks ago, and heard all about K-pop and Korean food.
*15:18.480- 15:24.880* :  And yesterday's speech in the state banquets, all about the global reach of Korean culture through
*15:24.880- 15:31.080* :  K-pop and their celebrity culture, which has now been embraced by people in Britain around the
*15:31.180- 15:36.360* :  world. I think this is a sort of dual track approach, trying to somewhere have a nice friendly,
*15:37.100- 15:41.920* :  rather glittery, sparkling social occasion, but underneath it is quite a hard-nosed politics,
*15:42.120- 15:48.820* :  and this is about trade and it's about military cooperation. And there are sort of coded references
*15:49.480- 15:54.800* :  to tensions in the region with China and their difficult neighborhoods. I think it's a bit of both
*15:54.800- 15:58.360* :  those things. State visits are an ordinary, pageantry and politics.
*15:59.520- 16:04.800* :  And now a bit of pop as well. So we had that state banquet in which we saw King Charles
*16:05.740- 16:11.780* :  speaking a few words of Korean to the delight of his guests, and it was a very glittering occasion,
*16:11.780- 16:16.320* :  as you say. But sadly, we didn't see the South Korean president singing as he has done on a
*16:16.320- 16:21.620* :  previous visit to the US. I think that really would have improved the occasion. American Pai was
*16:21.620- 16:26.780* :  his karaoke song of choice when he met Joe Biden. This was more of a sort of straight-laced occasion.
*16:27.160- 16:33.520* :  And even though King Charles threw in his own references to pop culture, the Korean president
*16:33.520- 16:40.120* :  Yun didn't reciprocate. They did talk about how much he loved Elton John and the Beatles and Queen.
*16:40.800- 16:45.260* :  And when he referenced Queen, we assumed he met the pop group and not any members of the royal family.
*16:45.780- 16:50.500* :  And it was a quite a jolly occasion, I have to say. It's a very, very big, very epic
*16:51.160- 16:56.640* :  ballroom they use for a thousand pieces of a dinner service and fancy cutlery and everyone
*16:56.640- 17:02.220* :  gets six glasses. But again, it was about sort of the business of sort of diplomatic schmoozing.
*17:03.000- 17:07.760* :  But I think sometimes these can be quite dull occasions and quite dour. This was quite light,
*17:07.760- 17:12.800* :  and it must have been a deliberate approach to keep it youthful, young, focusing on K-pop,
*17:12.800- 17:19.340* :  rather than just on money. Sean Cochlan. Africa is the continent most affected by malaria,
*17:19.340- 17:24.460* :  nearly all malaria deaths occur there. Most of them children under the age of five.
*17:25.120- 17:29.580* :  Now a groundbreaking malaria vaccine, the first to be approved by the World Health Organization,
*17:29.580- 17:36.040* :  is being delivered there. Cameroon has received more than 300,000 doses with more deliveries
*17:36.040- 17:41.400* :  expected over the coming weeks to other West African countries. It's already made a big difference
*17:41.400- 17:45.740* :  to nations like Kenya and Ghana, which were involved in the malaria pilot program.
*17:45.740- 17:52.320* :  Here's our Africa Health correspondent, Dokus Wangira. Cameroon's Health Minister, Dr. Manouda
*17:52.320- 17:58.860* :  Malachi, says the delivery of the malaria vaccines is a historic moment. Orelian Guyen from Gavi,
*17:58.860- 18:04.860* :  the vaccine lionces chief program of FISA, told the BBC that there is more work to be done.
*18:05.220- 18:09.100* :  It's not just a question of getting the vaccine in country, of course, that's an important part
*18:09.140- 18:14.660* :  and a huge milestone. But we need to also make sure that we have the infrastructure in place,
*18:14.660- 18:20.040* :  the cold chain, because the vaccines need to be kept at cold temperature, the training
*18:20.040- 18:25.440* :  of healthcare workers. The last thing you want is just a vaccine to appear out of the blue
*18:25.780- 18:29.200* :  and people not to understand what it's for, how it can be helpful.
*18:29.200- 18:35.000* :  The vaccine is administered in four doses for children from the age of five months to two years.
*18:35.100- 18:41.280* :  In Kenya, Ghana and Malawi, more than two million children have received at least a single dose.
*18:41.740- 18:47.820* :  Malaria is highly endemic in Cameroon, a deadly disease that is responsible for 70% of deaths
*18:47.820- 18:51.960* :  among children. Focom Joel, a citizen knows what it's like.
*18:53.980- 18:57.700* :  It's a usual disease that we grew up knowing. Whenever a child got malaria,
*18:57.700- 19:01.480* :  we'll generally say they were affected by the disease because they were growing up.
*19:01.820- 19:06.800* :  So yes, I have been affected by malaria and it's also common among people around me.
*19:07.700- 19:10.420* :  I'm not aware of the rollout of the vaccine, not at all.
*19:11.280- 19:14.260* :  The shots are expected in children's arms by next year.
*19:14.620- 19:20.040* :  WHO says the vaccine could save one life for every 200 children vaccinated.
*19:21.040- 19:27.260* :  Dorkas Mangira reporting. Behind the glamour of film sets lies a workplace that can be dangerous
*19:27.640- 19:32.660* :  and now the movie industry is returning to sound stages and on-site locations following the
*19:32.660- 19:38.280* :  recent writers and actors strikes in Hollywood. Industry figures are calling for health and safety
*19:38.280- 19:44.280* :  to be made a priority to avoid any more lives being put at risk. A series of high-profile
*19:44.280- 19:48.320* :  accidents has raised questions about the hazards involved for actors and crew members
*19:48.640- 19:53.200* :  while making films and TV shows. Our entertainment reporter, Sophie Van Bugen,
*19:53.560- 19:55.960* :  has been looking into the issue here in the UK.
*19:57.860- 19:59.820* :  This is one of the last pictures of Daddy.
*20:00.060- 20:04.000* :  Andrew Milsom is looking through tributes to her cameraman husband with her daughter Alice.
*20:04.200- 20:05.780* :  Do you remember any of those?
*20:07.020- 20:09.160* :  Alice was just 11 when she lost her father.
*20:09.840- 20:15.020* :  Mock Milsom died when filming a stunt. The camera he was on should have been unmanned.
*20:15.280- 20:19.720* :  My any real memory of that day is like I have my mum like scream and cry.
*20:19.820- 20:23.840* :  There was this very nice policeman on my doorstep with my mother hysterical
*20:24.840- 20:32.800* :  and he said to me there's been an accident and I don't know how to tell you this but your husband's
*20:32.800- 20:41.100* :  dad. It was just completely and utterly devastating.
*20:41.100- 20:47.080* :  I still text him so yeah when things happen I text him.
*20:47.300- 20:52.660* :  An inquest concluded the accident was entirely preventable and for Andrew it's left her with a
*20:52.660- 20:55.240* :  conviction that there's a wider safety problem.
*20:55.540- 20:58.360* :  I'd like the health and safety officer to be on that set.
*20:59.140- 21:03.420* :  Hold these people accountable. Hold their risk assessments accountable
*21:04.380- 21:07.840* :  and make sure that no family has to go through what we've been through.
*21:07.840- 21:14.800* :  I think that until health and safety is no longer a box-taking exercise nothing's going to change.
*21:14.920- 21:15.840* :  Why do you think it isn't?
*21:16.860- 21:18.820* :  I think people are scared.
*21:19.160- 21:23.520* :  I've been speaking to dozens of people who work in the industry from film crew and set designers
*21:23.520- 21:28.780* :  to runners who have either been injured or had near misses. They were too afraid to go on record
*21:28.780- 21:33.480* :  for fear of being labeled trouble makers and not getting hired again as they've seen happen
*21:33.480- 21:38.300* :  to others. The health and safety executive told us that without a change in the law it can only
*21:38.300- 21:44.200* :  get involved after an accident is reported. And what's adding extra urgency to this is the rapid
*21:44.200- 21:49.540* :  growth of the UK's film industry. When it comes to studio space it's now bigger than Hollywood.
*21:50.160- 21:55.740* :  So safety regulations which were written in the 70s are felt by campaigners to be simply out of date.
*21:58.480- 22:02.960* :  Cinematographer Chris Ross is finally able to return to filming following the actor's strike.
*22:02.960- 22:08.280* :  He's previously worked on big budget films like yesterday in Cats and he leads the organisation
*22:08.280- 22:10.680* :  that represents the UK's camera operators.
*22:11.020- 22:16.240* :  The industry is scaling up in a way that it's never been before. If the status quo stays the same
*22:16.240- 22:21.940* :  there will be more injuries, there will be more deaths. Fundamentally the change needs to be
*22:21.940- 22:27.880* :  industry-wide and if that requires a high level change of law then if that's what it takes that's
*22:27.880- 22:32.580* :  what it takes. The family of cameraman Mark Wilson have set up a foundation to help improve
*22:32.580- 22:39.060* :  safety standards. Samantha Wingsdeen runs it. The law which was made in 1974 so it's nearly 50 years
*22:39.180- 22:45.060* :  is not really currently fit for purpose. It does require employers to look out for the safety of
*22:45.060- 22:50.780* :  their staff but there's no requirement for somebody to prove that they've been trained. There's
*22:50.780- 22:56.900* :  no certification which is recognised globally in this area. That report was by Sophie Van
*22:56.900- 23:03.540* :  Brugen. Jeffrey Holt was an unassuming man. He enjoyed a simple life doing our jobs here and
*23:03.560- 23:08.980* :  there. His death at the age of 82 earlier this year was mourned quietly by some of the 4,000
*23:08.980- 23:15.000* :  residents of a small US town where he lived. So the people of Hinsdale in New Hampshire were shocked
*23:15.000- 23:21.480* :  to learn that he'd left a considerable sum to the neighbourhood nearly $4 million. My colleague
*23:21.480- 23:27.980* :  James Reynolds spoke to Jeffrey's friend Edwin Smith. He was a rather shy gentleman. He was
*23:28.740- 23:34.520* :  quite knowledgeable about international things and national things but he didn't really participate
*23:34.520- 23:41.720* :  in anything local as far as social organisations or participating in government except for making
*23:41.720- 23:49.100* :  sure that he voted. We did that without question. We told he lived frugally. Did you see that?
*23:50.360- 23:57.340* :  Absolutely he lived frugally. He wouldn't buy anything for himself unless he absolutely had to.
*23:57.720- 24:04.760* :  One exception to that. He did like his beer. He didn't drink to excess. I never saw him when he
*24:04.760- 24:11.060* :  was inebriated but he did enjoy a beer too but he always bought the least expensive beer he could.
*24:11.920- 24:19.820* :  How surprised were you? I was surprised several years before because he had told me that his
*24:20.260- 24:26.640* :  investments had done very very well. His investment account had over 7 digits and 7 figures.
*24:27.720- 24:34.040* :  So that was probably 15 years ago. I hadn't kept up with it since then. He told me that the
*24:34.040- 24:40.700* :  investments are doing well but we never talked specifics. So I really wasn't too surprised. I didn't
*24:40.700- 24:46.100* :  share that information with many people because I didn't want him to be bothered by somebody knowing
*24:46.100- 24:52.700* :  anything. Edwin it's not just that he lived frugally. It's not just that he had a fortune of almost
*24:52.700- 24:59.380* :  4 million dollars. It's that in his will he left that to the town. How is the town going to spend
*24:59.380- 25:08.020* :  that money? That money is going to be sent to the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation and they have
*25:08.020- 25:15.360* :  several many funds that are like this and they take the income from the trust that they hold
*25:16.160- 25:22.580* :  and they they will dispense that to the various entities in his day that will benefit from it.
*25:23.740- 25:26.480* :  That was Edwin Smith speaking to James Reynolds.
*25:29.940- 25:34.360* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*25:34.840- 25:39.680* :  Now as the next UN summit on climate change approaches we're making a special edition of the
*25:39.680- 25:44.320* :  Global News Podcast looking at where the world has got to in its efforts to tackle the problem.
*25:44.980- 25:49.180* :  So we want your questions which we're putting to two of our science and climate experts.
*25:49.800- 25:53.340* :  What would you like to know about the changing climate or about how these summits work?
*25:53.780- 25:57.900* :  Do you think our leaders are responding in the right way and what would you ask them if you were there?
*25:58.500- 26:02.660* :  We'd love to hear from you wherever you are in the world so do please send an email with
*26:02.660- 26:10.140* :  your question to globalpodcastatbbc.co.uk and if you can it would be great if you could include
*26:10.140- 26:15.520* :  a recording of your question along with your name and where you're from. We look forward to hearing
*26:15.520- 26:20.540* :  from you. This edition was mixed by Caroline Driscoll the producer was Madeleine Drury.
*26:20.600- 26:24.500* :  The editor is Karen Martin. I'm Jenna Jalil. Until next time goodbye.
*26:32.700- 26:37.460* :  Hey it's Ryan Reynolds owner and user of Mintmobile and I am recording this message on my phone
*26:37.500- 26:42.460* :  and literally on my mint phone. Why? Because fancy recording studios cost money and if we spent
