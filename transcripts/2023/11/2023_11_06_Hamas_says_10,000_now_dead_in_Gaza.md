*00:35.380- 00:40.140* :  I'm Janet Jalailan at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 6th of November. These are our main stories.
*00:40.220- 00:44.980* :  Israel has carried out one of its heaviest bombardments of Gaza so far.
*00:45.200- 00:49.900* :  The air strikes, according to the director of Shafa Hospital, who I managed to spoke to this
*00:49.900- 00:54.940* :  morning after the communication, where his home he said about 200 people were killed in those
*00:54.940- 01:00.060* :  strikes overnight. The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has concluded his tour of the
*01:00.060- 01:08.680* :  Middle East. We look at what it achieved. Also in this podcast, poor air quality in India is
*01:08.680- 01:14.160* :  affecting cricket in Delhi. Cricket is like a religion for us so nothing can stop us. I mean,
*01:14.160- 01:20.520* :  that is why I'm here with a mask on to support the best team. And a new memoir from Barbara Streisand.
*01:20.860- 01:26.880* :  I haven't had much fun in my life. Tell you the truth. And I want to have more fun.
*01:30.920- 01:35.140* :  We begin in Gaza. On Monday, shortly before we began recording this podcast,
*01:35.140- 01:40.500* :  the Hamas Run Health Ministry announced that the number of people killed by Israeli forces
*01:41.000- 01:47.960* :  had surpassed 10,000. Just over four weeks since the Hamas attack in which 1400 people were killed
*01:47.960- 01:54.180* :  in Israel, the Israeli bombardment of Gaza seems if anything to be intensifying. This, despite
*01:54.180- 01:59.400* :  a joint appeal by UN agencies and other aid groups for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
*02:00.000- 02:04.780* :  The Israeli military says it's reached the coastline to the south of Gaza City, effectively
*02:04.780- 02:10.560* :  cutting the territory into. Internet and phone communications were down overnight, but they have
*02:10.560- 02:16.960* :  now reportedly been restored. Our reporter in Gaza, Richie Aboualouf, says the air strikes overnight
*02:16.960- 02:21.440* :  were some of the heaviest since the current conflict began on October 7th.
*02:46.540- 02:51.460* :  The ambulance services and they said the my colleague here in the hospital who's a journalist
*02:51.460- 02:56.340* :  and his family is still in the north in Jabalya. I talked to his family yesterday. They said we
*02:56.340- 03:02.360* :  decided to leave and they took their cars and they drove about five kilometers from north into the
*03:02.360- 03:08.780* :  middle of Gaza City, Shijay area. And he said the road is completely blocked. And the only way
*03:08.780- 03:16.320* :  out of this is to walk. And imagine for people who are exhausted by a month of not clean water,
*03:16.320- 03:21.820* :  no proper food, they had to walk about six seven kilometers to cross this line which is the
*03:22.180- 03:28.200* :  what the Gaza where Israel said this is the line between the safe area and the operation area.
*03:28.660- 03:34.920* :  So they decided to go back because he said my my mom is old and she can't walk five kilometers
*03:34.920- 03:42.200* :  along this road. Well many many people they want to leave but they want access to the cars or
*03:42.220- 03:48.580* :  any access to transportation to get the people out. For now what we understand that very few
*03:48.580- 03:53.200* :  people who are fit enough to walk they manage to walk but we are talking about a few hundreds
*03:53.200- 03:59.000* :  is still according to the UN, about 400,000 people remaining in Gaza City and the north and it's
*03:59.000- 04:04.480* :  a huge number of people. Rusty Abu Alif in Gaza. Well a correspondent Mark Lohan is in southern
*04:04.480- 04:11.140* :  Israel near Gaza. Well you might be able to hear the odd thought of artillery from where we are
*04:11.560- 04:16.980* :  standing here today Jeanette we're about three kilometers away from the Gaza Strip. We're in southern
*04:16.980- 04:22.140* :  Israel and we've seen pretty frequent plumes of smoke and heard the outgoing thought of artillery
*04:22.140- 04:28.140* :  from Israel and and booms from inside as well. As Israel has pursued its offensive very intensively.
*04:28.140- 04:32.340* :  I mean our team on the ground inside Gaza says that they witnessed some of the heaviest air strikes
*04:32.340- 04:39.420* :  overnight since the war began. Israel says that they took out a Hamas observation post military
*04:39.420- 04:44.340* :  compound and that they killed in their words several terrorists. They also gave pretty detailed
*04:44.340- 04:50.820* :  briefing last night about when there are reports of Israeli air strikes around hospitals. They
*04:50.860- 04:58.680* :  showed slides and videos that they say show Hamas tunnels operating from underneath hospitals and
*04:58.680- 05:05.220* :  command centres in the area and fire coming from Hamas operatives around the hospitals. Hamas have
*05:05.220- 05:11.900* :  denied the validity of those videos and say that a UN team should come in to be able to
*05:12.680- 05:17.740* :  witness what is happening. But in total I mean the Israeli Defence Force says that they
*05:17.740- 05:22.280* :  have almost they have completely encircled Gaza City now and that they have in effect split
*05:22.280- 05:27.880* :  the territory into north and south. And meanwhile the calls for an humanitarian ceasefire
*05:28.100- 05:34.940* :  are intensifying and calls for more aid to be allowed in. The UN is describing the situation
*05:34.940- 05:41.120* :  as an entire population being under attack. All 18 major agencies of the United Nations
*05:41.880- 05:45.980* :  have today issued a joint call for an immediate ceasefire. You've had calls for the ceasefire
*05:45.980- 05:52.120* :  immediate ceasefire from Arab states. But the line from Israel is there will be no ceasefire until
*05:52.120- 05:57.300* :  those hostages are released and there will be no humanitarian pauses as America is urging
*05:57.300- 06:03.420* :  until there's progress on hostage release. Mark Lohan well in the last edition of this podcast we
*06:03.420- 06:08.300* :  heard how the top US diplomat Anthony Blinken was touring the Middle East in an effort to calm
*06:08.300- 06:14.100* :  tensions across the region. All as he tries to ensure the conflict doesn't spread and as he
*06:14.100- 06:19.520* :  tries to bring about short breaks in the fighting so-called humanitarian pauses so that desperately
*06:19.520- 06:25.640* :  needed aid including food and water can be brought into the besieged territory. He's also working
*06:25.640- 06:30.880* :  on securing the release of the hostages held by Hamas and Gaza some of him are American citizens.
*06:31.800- 06:37.340* :  On Friday he visited Israel then Jordan on Saturday and the West Bank and Iraq on Sunday.
*06:37.340- 06:44.640* :  In his latest diplomatic dash Mr Blinken has been visiting Turkey. Here he is speaking to reporters
*06:44.640- 06:49.720* :  as he prepared to fly out of the country. We're working as I said very aggressively on getting
*06:49.720- 06:55.100* :  more humanitarian assistance into Gaza and we have very concrete ways of doing that and I think
*06:55.100- 07:01.220* :  you'll see in the days ahead that that assistance can expand in significant ways so that more
*07:01.220- 07:05.760* :  gets into people who need it and gets to the people who need it as well as making sure that people
*07:05.760- 07:12.880* :  can continue to come out of Gaza. I think we've had important conversations and more than conversations
*07:13.640- 07:19.040* :  we're making sure that the different influence and relationships that countries in the
*07:19.040- 07:23.760* :  region have including the countries that I visited or spoke to that they're using that to make
*07:23.760- 07:28.700* :  sure that this conflict in crisis doesn't spread. Mr Blinken they're talking about the good
*07:28.700- 07:33.840* :  progress he says he's made in his talks but did he really achieve anything? Our diplomatic
*07:33.840- 07:39.360* :  correspondent is James Landel. The point that he was making is that he's going around talking to
*07:39.360- 07:44.080* :  everybody about all the key issues and the crucial point he wanted to make is if we can just get a
*07:44.080- 07:49.660* :  humanitarian pause then that potentially unlocks the other issues. It unlocks movement on aid,
*07:49.660- 07:54.380* :  potentially unlocks movement on hostages, potentially unlocks movement on getting more foreign
*07:54.380- 08:02.960* :  nationals out but right now he's caught between on the one hand the Israelis saying absolutely no
*08:02.960- 08:08.840* :  ceasefire or any kind of pause until we get movement on the hostages whereas all the Arab
*08:08.840- 08:13.440* :  countries and others that he's visited have all said look we simply have to have a ceasefire
*08:13.440- 08:17.940* :  right now before we can start talking about anything else. So he's caught between those two things
*08:19.000- 08:25.080* :  the sort of the broader point he made was that everybody agreed that America should be there
*08:25.080- 08:29.460* :  showing some leadership because frankly there's not much leadership from anybody else at the
*08:29.460- 08:35.460* :  moment that's evident and also he said look sometimes you can make progress by evidence that bad
*08:35.460- 08:40.540* :  things haven't happened and he said the one common denominator was that everybody said we need
*08:40.540- 08:47.480* :  to make sure that there is no escalation of this conflict because that is a big fear isn't it
*08:47.520- 08:51.300* :  that he could draw in other groups in the region or the countries in the region.
*08:51.840- 08:57.680* :  Yeah and so for example during the weekend Mr Blinken went to Baghdad and he spoke to the Iraqi
*08:57.680- 09:03.880* :  Prime Minister, Mr Al-Azadani, Mr Al-Tadani today is in Iran talking to President Reisi
*09:03.880- 09:09.400* :  clearly reporting back to the Iranians what the Americans have told him. So in other words
*09:09.680- 09:13.220* :  if there are messages from the Americans that can get to the Iranians and then back again
*09:13.220- 09:19.940* :  through the Iraqis that is an example of the diplomacy taking place because as you say what nobody
*09:19.940- 09:26.980* :  wants in the region is for this thing to expand potentially by I don't know settler violence
*09:26.980- 09:32.720* :  expanding in the West Bank potentially an Iran-backed armed force like Abdullah
*09:33.760- 09:38.580* :  increasing its attacks on Israel in the north as we know two American carrier fleets are in the
*09:38.580- 09:43.180* :  Mediterranean the risk of escalation is there and I think everybody is trying to work to make
*09:43.180- 09:48.040* :  sure it doesn't happen. James Lander as we've been hearing the U.S. is heavily involved in the
*09:48.040- 09:52.860* :  attempt to calm the ongoing crisis by diplomatic means but how is this affecting President Biden
*09:52.860- 09:58.740* :  and his chances of re-election. A recent poll by the Arab American Institute shows a dramatic drop
*09:58.740- 10:04.320* :  in support over the way he's handled the Middle East. It suggests that support has plummeted
*10:04.320- 10:12.740* :  from 59% in 2020 to just 17%. That means the Democrats are not the party of choice for Arab
*10:12.740- 10:19.820* :  Americans for the first time in nearly 30 years. If it stays like this Mr. Biden could lose a key
*10:19.820- 10:25.440* :  Midwestant state like Michigan in next year's election, a state which he won from Donald Trump
*10:25.440- 10:32.120* :  in 2020. It's home to the U.S.'s largest American Arab population particularly in the city of
*10:32.120- 10:36.840* :  Dearborn where many seem to be turning against him. Our North American correspondent Nomiya
*10:36.840- 10:42.980* :  Ikbal sent this report from there. I zoom in to these pictures, the horrible graphic pictures that I see
*10:43.200- 10:47.620* :  and I just look to see as he in the background, is he somewhere, are they searching for him? I'm just
*10:47.620- 10:52.760* :  trying to find like any clue that leads to him. Nadia Ayub is as a fundraising event for Gaza.
*10:52.760- 10:58.020* :  She scrolls through social media desperately looking for 18-year-old Mohammed Raya the Abu Hussein.
*10:58.060- 11:03.900* :  He has black glasses and a missing leg. Mohammed came to Michigan from Gaza for a prosthetic
*11:03.900- 11:10.000* :  limb when he was 13. Nadia and husband Mike took him in. He was with us for five months and during
*11:10.000- 11:16.060* :  that time we absolutely fell in love with him. He became a son to me and it would forever be my son.
*11:16.140- 11:20.980* :  They last received a WhatsApp from him a week ago when he left the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza.
*11:21.340- 11:27.120* :  He's told me don't worry about me. And since then nothing. The couple are angry at the U.S.
*11:27.120- 11:33.160* :  government strong support for Israel. He had my vote but it's gone now. Can you have a
*11:33.160- 11:38.060* :  get it back? No. It's a sentiment that's widespread across the city where more than half the
*11:38.060- 11:43.460* :  population is of Arab heritage and you can see it in the cultural landscape. The Middle East
*11:43.460- 11:48.880* :  and grocery stores, the bakeries that serve Yemeni coffee. I've got the local newspaper here.
*11:49.460- 11:55.080* :  It's entirely dedicated to the Israel Hamas war. The headline is blunt. He lost our votes.
*11:55.860- 12:00.280* :  Samadoun is a dearborn county commissioner. President Biden's commitment to Israel has been
*12:00.280- 12:06.320* :  well documented for decades. What's different now? I'm surprised personally that the president of
*12:06.320- 12:12.680* :  the United States made a trip during a war and he even participated in a cabinet discussion with
*12:12.680- 12:19.040* :  the Israeli military. The people right now are very angry. Will they forget by next November?
*12:19.380- 12:24.420* :  I don't think a lot of people are going to forget that honestly. Donald Trump could be the
*12:24.420- 12:29.360* :  alternative, the likely Republican nominee. But as president he moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem
*12:29.360- 12:35.500* :  that angered Arab nations and barred people from seven Muslim majority countries from entering America.
*12:36.600- 12:41.040* :  We'll never forget and this is deep like this is personal to us and this is deep part great.
*12:41.300- 12:46.500* :  We meet Netta Al-Hanuti at a local coffee shop. She's executive director of M Gage which helped
*12:46.500- 12:52.900* :  turn out the Muslim vote in 2020. Biden won Michigan by 155,000 votes. Michigan Muslims turned
*12:52.900- 12:59.040* :  out 145,000 and that means that Biden needs a Muslim vote in order to win Michigan. It doesn't look
*12:59.040- 13:02.940* :  too good for him right now. You know I'm hearing friends that are telling me that they're either
*13:02.940- 13:07.780* :  voting third party or they're staying home. President Biden's administration recently announced
*13:07.780- 13:12.920* :  the country's first national strategy to counter Islamophobia as well as other forms of discrimination
*13:12.920- 13:19.040* :  including anti-Semitism. We're not stupid. I mean the timing is suspect when he knows that he's
*13:19.040- 13:24.400* :  losing our communities. Back at the fundraising events Amir Zahir says for many here Biden was a
*13:24.400- 13:29.760* :  forced choice in 2020 but won't be next year. If you're in the middle of the desert and you're
*13:29.760- 13:34.460* :  about to starve to death and your only option is a ham sandwich you're allowed to eat it. So Biden
*13:34.460- 13:39.840* :  was a ham sandwich but don't forget once your hunger is quenched he's still a ham sandwich. You
*13:39.840- 13:44.460* :  can't go back and have him the next day. President Biden said he understands the emotions on the
*13:44.460- 13:50.060* :  Arab side and the Jewish side but his actions abroad now threaten him at home as the war continues
*13:50.060- 13:55.980* :  it could reshape the political landscape when it comes to his reelection. Nomiya Iqbal reporting
*13:55.980- 14:01.960* :  from Dearborn in Michigan. Let's go to China now where the Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese
*14:01.960- 14:07.960* :  has met the Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing for talks aimed at easing years of tensions
*14:07.960- 14:13.880* :  between the two trading partners. Mr Albanese is the first Australian leader to visit China for
*14:13.880- 14:18.760* :  seven years. Speaking ahead of the meeting the Prime Minister said the two countries frosty
*14:18.760- 14:26.380* :  relations appeared to be thawing. The engagement that I've had with China with President Xi
*14:26.840- 14:32.540* :  had been positive. They had been constructive. He has never said anything to me that has not
*14:32.660- 14:39.300* :  been done and that's a positive way that you have to start off dealing with people but we recognize
*14:39.300- 14:48.200* :  as well that we come with different political systems very different values. Mickey Bristol is
*14:48.200- 14:54.120* :  our Asia Pacific editor and began by explaining why the relationship initially broke down. Essentially
*14:54.120- 14:59.840* :  they've got different political outlooks on the world and it all kicked off primarily because of
*14:59.840- 15:06.440* :  Covid. Australia a few years back asked for an independent inquiry into Covid. China where the
*15:06.780- 15:14.040* :  disease emerged from refused that and also began to impose sanctions and tariffs on Australian imports
*15:14.180- 15:19.160* :  that really led to a deterioration in the relationship which the Australian Prime Minister
*15:19.760- 15:25.900* :  particularly Anthony Albanese sought to kind of repair and when they first met in Beijing today
*15:25.900- 15:31.420* :  they both acknowledged that difficult history of the last couple of years. In fact Xi Jinping said
*15:31.420- 15:36.180* :  we've worked through some problems and the Australian Prime Minister acknowledged that too so
*15:36.720- 15:42.200* :  I think both leaders have recognized that the difficulties they had over the last few years
*15:42.740- 15:48.720* :  and that they've now looking to get through that and indeed some of those tariffs which I mentioned
*15:48.720- 15:54.540* :  just a few moments ago China has started to lift them so kind of not just good talking but also
*15:54.540- 16:00.440* :  positive benefits too. So it seems like there's good news there for Australian exporters. How much
*16:00.440- 16:06.640* :  progress has this meeting made do you think in Mending Pences? A reasonable amount of course
*16:06.640- 16:11.160* :  that was poor relations before and they're all saying very nice things to each other at the moment
*16:11.160- 16:17.620* :  but I think when you hear Mr Albanese there the piece of audio we've just heard where we talked
*16:17.620- 16:23.540* :  about the different political systems between China and Australia that's pivotal that's not going
*16:23.540- 16:27.620* :  to change they're both going to have very different views of the world I'll just give you one
*16:27.620- 16:33.980* :  issue the South China Sea where China is advanced and it's been more assertive Australia is pushing
*16:33.980- 16:40.140* :  back at that it's also a formal alliances with people who want to push back at China as well Japan
*16:40.220- 16:46.260* :  India the United States so that's not going to change the trading relationship means both sides
*16:46.260- 16:51.920* :  can't ignore each other but looking ahead there's going to be political differences whatever they say
*16:51.920- 16:59.680* :  engaging today. Mickey Bristol still to come on the podcast. We've seen a real spike in these
*16:59.680- 17:07.500* :  users of bulk maritime cocaine consignments off the coast of Guinea since early 2022. A massive
*17:07.500- 17:13.720* :  drugs bust off the coast of West Africa by the French Navy we hear from an agency tackling organized
*17:21.440- 17:27.180* :  crime. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. Let's go to India now even for a city known for its
*17:27.180- 17:33.620* :  high levels of pollution the capital deli is currently experiencing exceptionally poor air quality
*17:34.120- 17:38.800* :  officials say the thick smog has been caused by farmers in nearby states burning crop stubble
*17:39.280- 17:44.100* :  and a lack of wind. Schools have already been closed and now the authorities have stopped
*17:44.100- 17:49.940* :  construction projects and banned the most polluting vehicles from entering the city. Also affected
*17:49.940- 17:54.060* :  are the cricket teams for Bangladesh and Sri Lanka which have gone ahead with a World Cup
*17:54.060- 18:00.340* :  Magic deli despite concerns about how it will affect the players health. These cricket fans
*18:00.340- 18:06.300* :  outside the stadium weren't put off either. Cricket is like a religion for us so nothing can stop us I
*18:06.300- 18:11.360* :  mean that is why I'm here with a mask on to support the best team. Please please please mask up
*18:11.480- 18:15.380* :  it's important to stay healthy at the same time enjoy the game of cricket. We heard more from
*18:15.380- 18:20.960* :  South Asia correspondent Samir Hussein who's in Delhi. The air quality right now where I am
*18:20.960- 18:29.000* :  is hovering between four to 450 which is still really quite severe if you look at you know what
*18:29.080- 18:34.180* :  people should be doing at these times they should minimize their time outdoors they should wear
*18:34.180- 18:40.020* :  masks if they are going outdoors and as we heard from the Bangladeshi cricket coach you know
*18:40.140- 18:46.660* :  some of his players are asthmatic and this poor air quality poses even more danger to anyone with
*18:46.660- 18:52.660* :  any lung or respiratory illnesses and so people are really recommended to to keep off the streets.
*18:53.200- 18:58.680* :  As you mentioned you know there's been a lot of measures implemented by the government there is
*18:58.680- 19:03.940* :  no construction in fact even as we were coming to where we are to speak with you and to talk to
*19:03.940- 19:10.240* :  individuals you know we saw just lines of construction vehicles that are just standing still on the
*19:10.240- 19:16.620* :  roadside because all construction has been stopped schools have been closed they closed last week
*19:16.620- 19:22.900* :  on Friday and they are going to be closed for the rest of the week and that just gives you a
*19:22.900- 19:29.280* :  sense of just how significant the pollution levels are in the city right now. Does this not put matches
*19:29.280- 19:33.760* :  like the one currently going on between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at risk given such a high level
*19:33.760- 19:41.240* :  of pollution. Absolutely and as we know even the practice sessions of both teams were affected
*19:41.240- 19:46.680* :  we heard from the coach about some of those practices in fact neither team practiced yesterday
*19:46.680- 19:52.600* :  and there was even question about whether or not they were going to play a game later on today
*19:52.600- 19:58.000* :  but they decided to play that game so it really does pose a risk for a lot of players and it's not
*19:58.000- 20:03.600* :  just deli that's seeing really high levels of pollution you're also seeing that in Mumbai
*20:03.600- 20:09.620* :  which normally doesn't see this kind of pollution regularly because it benefits from the wind
*20:09.620- 20:14.600* :  for coming off the ocean that dissipates pollution they're not even seeing the benefit of that
*20:14.600- 20:18.860* :  right now. This is something that seems to happen every year why can't the Indian authorities
*20:18.860- 20:25.240* :  manage to control these levels of pollution. Well a lot of it has to do with what's happening outside
*20:25.240- 20:31.820* :  of the city so you have a situation where you have farmers that are burning their fields and with
*20:31.840- 20:38.500* :  that it brings quite a lot of pollution that sort of hangs in the air then you have the lack of wind
*20:38.500- 20:44.880* :  to move any of this away and you see that actually during the morning and evening times it's really
*20:44.880- 20:50.780* :  when the pollution is at its worst. Samira Hussein in Delhi a former leader of the MS-13 criminal
*20:50.780- 20:57.220* :  gang in Honduras arrested a year ago in neighbouring Nicaragua has been sentenced to 15 years in jail.
*20:57.220- 21:03.040* :  He'd been wanted for drug smuggling, money laundering, extortion, human trafficking and murder.
*21:03.520- 21:07.760* :  Our America's regional editor Leonardo Rosha spoke to my colleague Alex Rickson.
*21:08.460- 21:15.100* :  His name is Davi Elias Campelicona he was born in northern Honduras and started to work with
*21:15.100- 21:21.820* :  a gang at a very young age but he was mainly money laundering person. He was also moving drugs from
*21:21.820- 21:28.640* :  one place to the other and he got higher and higher in the gang in Honduras until about five,
*21:28.640- 21:35.640* :  six years ago he was really wanted by the police there in Honduras and he escaped to Nicaragua
*21:36.020- 21:41.700* :  where he was arrested a year ago. He was sanctioned earlier this year by the United States
*21:42.840- 21:48.740* :  Treasury who accused him of murder. He's been charged in New York with murder, racketeering and
*21:49.420- 21:55.980* :  a number of other criminal offenses associated with his gang the MS-13 or Mara Salvatrucha.
*21:56.240- 22:02.020* :  Tell us more about MS-13 because it began life as a violent drug and extortion gang in central
*22:02.020- 22:07.020* :  America but it's alleged to be really the driving force of mass migration into the US.
*22:07.600- 22:13.200* :  Well yes the main, most of the migrants or a great number of migrants who arrive in the US
*22:13.200- 22:19.340* :  on the board of Mexico and the US come from that region from central America's from central
*22:19.340- 22:25.040* :  American countries and what they say is they're escaping poverty in violence at home. These gangs
*22:25.040- 22:31.180* :  they're not as big as the Mexican cartels that they operate with huge amounts of drugs and
*22:31.180- 22:38.180* :  a much more widespread but these gangs there are two main gangs in the region MS-13 and the
*22:38.340- 22:44.740* :  18th Street. They were founded by people who had gone from central America to Los Angeles to
*22:44.740- 22:51.560* :  California and went back bringing that culture of gang and violence. What they do is they make
*22:51.560- 22:58.200* :  people pay for example to have businesses, they extort money from people, people even have
*22:58.200- 23:04.460* :  transport taxes, motorbikes and they make life very difficult. Also they make young people
*23:04.460- 23:11.800* :  join the gang or they tend them into joining the gang at the very young age and images of those
*23:11.800- 23:19.540* :  people with tattoos over their face with their MS-13 or 18 figures go around the world. They're very
*23:19.540- 23:26.880* :  violent, they're very widespread and they operate also in the United States and Canada and that's why
*23:27.440- 23:32.680* :  the United States has been trying to give money to countries in central America to try to tackle
*23:32.680- 23:39.540* :  them there. Leonardo Rossa, on Sunday the French Navy said it had seized nearly 900 kilograms of
*23:39.540- 23:44.320* :  cocaine from a fishing boat off the coast of West Africa. This haul comes just over a month after
*23:44.320- 23:49.340* :  the French authorities also successfully intercepted another boat carrying nearly two and a half
*23:49.340- 23:54.240* :  tons of cocaine in the Gulf of Guinea. Lucille Bird is the director of the observatory of
*23:54.240- 23:59.900* :  illicit economies in West Africa at the global initiative against transnational organized crime.
*24:00.460- 24:04.640* :  She spoke to Rob Young about the drug trafficking routes that go through West Africa.
*24:05.520- 24:11.000* :  This seizure is very material but it's within the range that we've regularly been seeing
*24:11.000- 24:18.200* :  in the Gulf of Guinea since 2019 in particular so roughly between one and three tons and this
*24:18.200- 24:23.480* :  seizure in particular being off the coast of Guinea and we've seen a real spike in the seizures of
*24:23.480- 24:30.760* :  bulk maritime cocaine consignments off the coast of Guinea since early 2022, months after the
*24:30.760- 24:38.580* :  September 2021 coup where we haven't really seen them before. And as to the French Navy,
*24:38.580- 24:45.080* :  they've been operating in West African waters for many years and are a key element of the regional
*24:45.080- 24:49.660* :  and international maritime response to cocaine trafficking in the region. And so the drugs are
*24:49.660- 24:57.480* :  coming from where and then ultimately going to where. So the cocaine is being produced in Latin
*24:57.480- 25:04.340* :  America and then being moved both by air and to a much larger extent by sea from Latin America
*25:04.780- 25:10.880* :  predominantly from Brazil via West Africa on its way to Europe. On the maritime routes we're seeing
*25:10.880- 25:17.220* :  containers that typically go via Europe often Spain because of limited direct Brazil to West Africa
*25:17.220- 25:23.840* :  container routes but we're also increasingly seeing other vessels like bulk cargo ships or like in
*25:23.840- 25:29.660* :  this case fishing boats which can use direct routes between Brazil and West Africa and these are
*25:29.660- 25:34.860* :  often trans shipping onto smaller boats offshore with the cocaine then brought onto lands through
*25:34.860- 25:42.400* :  the porous coastlines. Once the cocaine is in West Africa the majority moves onto Europe again by sea
*25:43.080- 25:48.540* :  although some moves in large volumes also northwards by land via the Sahel, Mali, Niger
*25:49.040- 25:54.440* :  and North Africa towards Europe and then we have some which is broken up into smaller volumes and
*25:54.440- 26:01.660* :  moved also by air to Europe. And a key point to really underscore is that since around 2016
*26:01.660- 26:09.080* :  Brazil has really emerged as the major export point making the Primaio Commando da Capitale the
*26:09.080- 26:13.900* :  biggest organized crime network in Brazil with influence over a huge proportion of the cocaine
*26:13.900- 26:19.120* :  market a really key player in cocaine reaching Europe via West Africa. And when the cocaine
*26:19.120- 26:25.460* :  arrives on land in West Africa are there many people in West Africa nations who are effectively
*26:25.460- 26:33.540* :  earning a living from its transit? The cocaine market benefits relatively few. We see profits flowing
*26:33.540- 26:41.540* :  to a smaller number of relatively important traffickers as well as to some extent to elements of
*26:41.540- 26:47.280* :  state structures and we have seen regularly in investigations into these large cocaine consignments
*26:48.080- 26:52.360* :  that they've identified the complicity of elements of security forces, vision,
*26:52.360- 26:58.640* :  the police or others. But the cocaine trade really does not benefit the vast majority of people
*26:58.640- 27:02.060* :  in West Africa with profits really kept in relatively few hands.
*27:02.840- 27:06.920* :  Let's see a bit from the global initiative against transnational organized crime.
*27:07.980- 27:14.080* :  More than six decades ago an unknown singer entered a talent contest hoping to win a free dinner.
*27:14.760- 27:20.140* :  Her name was Barbara Streisand and she didn't just get a meal. Since then she sold tens of
*27:20.140- 27:25.000* :  millions of albums and won a staggering array of awards for her acting and songwriting,
*27:25.520- 27:31.420* :  making her one of the select few to have won Emmys, Grammys, Oscars and a Tony Award.
*27:32.140- 27:37.220* :  Now she's written her autobiography and she's been talking to our music correspondent Mark Savage.
*27:38.240- 27:45.040* :  Hello gorgeous. What I realized in writing this book this is my legacy. I mean I wrote my story.
*27:45.360- 27:53.380* :  Mary's like the corners of my mind.
*27:54.680- 27:59.060* :  One of your first memories you're about five years old singing in the whole way of your apartment
*27:59.060- 28:04.160* :  block in Brooklyn. Were you thinking about the acoustics even then? I think I was.
*28:05.040- 28:10.820* :  You know it was like a built-in echo. It was great sound. My little girlfriends and I used to
*28:10.820- 28:18.060* :  sing songs together so I was known on the block as the kid with a good voice and no father
*28:18.360- 28:25.380* :  because all my girlfriends had fathers so I always felt odd. You father died when you were very young
*28:25.380- 28:29.880* :  and your mother remarried but after that it felt like there wasn't a lot of warmth in the house
*28:29.880- 28:37.140* :  particularly from your stepfather. I don't remember ever him talking to me, asking me any questions
*28:37.140- 28:45.100* :  how am I, how is school, anything. He was mean. I never understood that how my mother stood for that.
*28:46.180- 28:52.080* :  In 1964 Streisand scored her breakout role in the Broadway musical Funny Girl but she couldn't
*28:52.080- 28:57.020* :  enjoy the success because her co-star Sydney Chaplin was constantly undermining her.
*29:07.980- 29:14.800* :  He had a crush on me which was unusual. I mean I don't remember many men having crushes on me
*29:16.080- 29:22.480* :  and when I said to him I don't want to be involved with you. He was married. I was married at the time.
*29:23.480- 29:31.620* :  He turned on me in such a way that was very cruel I think. He started muttering under his breath
*29:31.660- 29:39.240* :  while I was talking on stage. He would mutter terrible words to me, curse words and
*29:39.980- 29:45.560* :  he wouldn't look into my eyes anymore. When you're acting it's really important to
*29:46.280- 29:53.080* :  react to that other person and he threw me you know sometimes I thought well what the hell is the
*29:53.080- 30:00.980* :  next word. I feel so flustered and my stomach is killing me and I can't get off the stage now.
*30:00.980- 30:13.540* :  I still have another half hour. I feel the room swing. In the book Streisand details the many
*30:13.540- 30:18.880* :  battles she fought for creative control of her work. A self-admitted perfectionist she even
*30:18.880- 30:24.440* :  intervened when Apple's voice assistant Siri pronounced her name wrong. Streisand I said my name
*30:24.440- 30:31.200* :  isn't with a Z. It's Streisand like sand on the beach. Streisand I figured I'd better call
*30:31.200- 30:40.360* :  Apple. I mean the head of Apple. Tim Cook was so lovely and he had Siri change the pronunciation
*30:40.360- 30:46.800* :  of my name. That's one perk of fame. Yes you know. Shall we check that it works? I've got my phone
*30:46.800- 30:52.000* :  hair. Oh yeah. Hey Siri who's saying Papa can you hear me? Barbara Streisand sings the song Papa
*30:52.240- 31:06.640* :  can you hear me? It worked? Papa can you hear me? Papa can you see me? I'm a very private person. I
*31:06.640- 31:14.280* :  don't enjoy stardom. I thought I wanted stardom as a young girl but when I got it I found it
*31:14.280- 31:20.160* :  obtrusive. That's why I gave up doing concerts too you know. Yeah it's a lot of pressure I think
*31:20.680- 31:24.300* :  when you're younger you said you wanted to be famous just so you could get someone else to make
*31:24.300- 31:29.540* :  your bed but I don't think the tradeoff was worth it. That's right I could never figure out those
*31:47.020- 31:55.420* :  corners. I want to live life. I want to get in my husband's truck and just wander hopefully with
*31:55.420- 32:03.740* :  the children somewhere near us. When they come over we have fun. I haven't had much fun in my life
*32:03.740- 32:11.240* :  tell you the truth and I want to have more fun. Barbara Streisand who's brought so much fun to so
*32:11.240- 32:19.800* :  many of us talking to Mark Savage. And that's it from this edition of the Global News Podcast but
