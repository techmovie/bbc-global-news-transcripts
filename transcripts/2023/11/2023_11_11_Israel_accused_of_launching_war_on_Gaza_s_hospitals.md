*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:17.320* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:20.520- 00:26.740* :  I'm Nigel Adely and in the early hours of Saturday 11th of November, these are on main stories.
*00:27.500- 00:32.840* :  Another harrowing day in northern Gaza, as Palestinian officials say three hospitals
*00:32.840- 00:38.480* :  have been hit by strikes from the Israeli military who believe they've been used by Hamas.
*00:38.860- 00:44.540* :  Our forces are operating around the area because Hamas has chosen to strategically position
*00:44.540- 00:49.100* :  their terrorist capabilities in under and around hospitals. The French president,
*00:49.100- 00:53.420* :  Emmanuel Macron speaks to the BBC about the ongoing conflict.
*00:53.780- 01:00.240* :  De facto, this baby, this lady, this is all people are bound and killed. There is no reason for that
*01:00.240- 01:05.780* :  a knowledge missing. So we do urge his role to stop. Now it's time for his fire.
*01:08.840- 01:13.900* :  Also in this podcast, the White House says President Biden will meet the Chinese leader
*01:13.900- 01:20.740* :  Xi Jinping next week to try and stabilize relations. And President Erdogan says he's prepared
*01:20.940- 01:25.320* :  to change the Turkish constitution to end a judicial dispute.
*01:29.560- 01:35.780* :  The hospitals of northern Gaza are facing an increasingly grave situation as Israeli forces
*01:35.780- 01:42.040* :  press ahead with their offensive against Hamas. Explosions have been reported at or near
*01:42.040- 01:46.980* :  several of them and local officials say Israeli strikes have hit three.
*01:47.660- 01:53.140* :  The director of the biggest hospital in the territory, Al-Shifa, accused Israel of launching
*01:53.140- 02:00.880* :  a war on hospitals. Dr. Marwan Abu Sada is a general surgeon there. He said the situation is
*02:00.880- 02:06.360* :  desperate. Here in Shifa, I'm hearing the shooting and bombardment everywhere around me,
*02:06.360- 02:11.200* :  but our stuff is still there and our patients still there and we are taking casualties.
*02:11.340- 02:16.980* :  Today they've bombarded some of our displaced people who were here in Shifa at the school
*02:16.980- 02:21.540* :  they were under attack and more than 15 people killed at that moment.
*02:22.120- 02:26.700* :  Nobel First Sack is the spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent Society,
*02:27.460- 02:32.580* :  who runs the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is surrounded by Israeli tanks
*02:33.100- 02:38.800* :  and is completely cut off. This is the third day we have completely lost connection with our
*02:38.800- 02:44.160* :  colleagues at Al-Quds Hospital due to intense bombardment that is taking place in that area.
*02:44.380- 02:50.320* :  This is also the fifth day Al-Quds Hospital has been isolated because all roads that lead
*02:50.320- 02:57.180* :  to Al-Quds Hospital are closed. No one can reach Al-Quds Hospital. No one also can go out if
*02:57.180- 03:03.300* :  from Al-Quds Hospital. The situation there is catastrophe. Yesterday with the rare communication,
*03:03.380- 03:10.140* :  I got a call from one of our colleagues and he told us that we are four 24 hours and we will
*03:10.140- 03:16.920* :  be completely running out of a fuel. That means the hospital will be forced to shut down
*03:16.920- 03:22.640* :  completely all of its services. Israel say the Al-Shifa Hospital is being used by Hamas
*03:22.640- 03:28.940* :  as a command center, something which the medics there have denied. A statement from the Israeli
*03:28.940- 03:34.340* :  military says they do not fire on hospitals and they are very much aware of the sensitivity.
*03:35.060- 03:40.960* :  But if they do see Hamas fighters firing from hospitals, they will kill them. Lieutenant
*03:40.960- 03:47.300* :  Colonel Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, confirmed Israel's military presence near hospitals
*03:47.340- 03:52.820* :  and urged civilians in the north of Gaza to move. We've been encouraging people to go south
*03:52.840- 03:58.280* :  to Wadi Gaza precisely because we're not operating on the ground in Wadi Gaza because Hamas is
*03:58.420- 04:02.640* :  pub of operations is in Gaza City and that's where their center of command and control.
*04:02.640- 04:08.500* :  All of those capabilities exist. We are determined to dismantle and destroy Hamas as a governing
*04:08.500- 04:13.900* :  authority and the terrorist entity in the Gaza Strip. They have to go. Our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*04:13.900- 04:19.600* :  Paul Adams told me more about what's been happening in Gaza. I think what we learned today is that
*04:19.600- 04:25.740* :  as the Israeli forces get further into Gaza City, it is becoming harder and harder to have
*04:25.740- 04:31.840* :  any real visibility on exactly what is happening. I mean, we know that the Israeli military is
*04:31.840- 04:38.080* :  close to these hospitals as you've heard from their spokesman and we know that there are regular
*04:38.080- 04:44.280* :  incidents in which significant numbers of people are being killed. We cannot say with any great
*04:44.280- 04:50.800* :  certainty how this is happening. It is clear that there are gun battles going on in the vicinity
*04:50.800- 04:56.120* :  of some of these hospitals. The Israelis are saying that Hamas are there and that they are using
*04:56.120- 05:02.100* :  the hospitals as cover for their military activity. We cannot independently verify that, but I think
*05:02.100- 05:07.360* :  it's reasonable to assume that Israeli forces would not be attacking a hospital full of civilians
*05:07.360- 05:12.600* :  if it didn't think that there was some kind of military necessity. The problem is that because
*05:12.600- 05:19.100* :  there are still so many civilians who may want now to get out but perhaps can't feel it's too
*05:19.540- 05:24.560* :  dangerous to leave those premises. It is almost inevitable now that more and more people are
*05:24.560- 05:30.020* :  being caught up in this campaign. And how is the situation in Gaza's hospitals and around them
*05:30.020- 05:35.180* :  being viewed by people where you are in Israel? Well, the Israeli public is by and large still
*05:35.180- 05:41.000* :  very supportive of what is going on. It certainly supports the military and shares the desire of
*05:41.000- 05:46.280* :  the government to root out Hamas once and for all. No Israeli wants to be in a position that they
*05:46.280- 05:51.240* :  were in on October the 7th. And a majority feel that the only way to make sure that that doesn't
*05:51.240- 05:56.140* :  happen again is to destroy Hamas once and for all. That's not the same as saying that they are
*05:56.140- 06:00.020* :  confident in their government or indeed in their prime minister, both of whom enjoy pretty
*06:00.020- 06:05.880* :  low ratings at the moment. But I think there is a general understanding that the Israeli military
*06:05.880- 06:10.560* :  is doing what it needs to do. And so for the time being at least, it enjoys pretty widespread
*06:10.700- 06:17.160* :  popular support. Whether this continues, the longer it goes on is hard to know. The IDF
*06:17.180- 06:23.060* :  apparently is saying tonight that they are preparing to expand into new areas. And according to
*06:23.060- 06:30.260* :  one TV report preparing for a war that will be a year long. That is a long time to stretch anyone's
*06:30.260- 06:37.580* :  patience. Paul Adams. The BBC has been following the lives of five people inside Gaza as they face
*06:37.580- 06:44.520* :  almost daily bombardments. They've been recording diaries and these are their stories. In our
*06:44.520- 06:51.280* :  second report, hebar Bittar speaks to Farida Adal Al-Ghul, an English teacher who fled the north
*06:51.280- 06:57.440* :  of the strip before deciding the south was no safer. I don't know if this is the last record I'm
*06:57.440- 07:02.820* :  going to make or not, but this is Farida Adal. I'm located in the center of Gaza. The very first
*07:02.820- 07:08.240* :  message Farida sent to the BBC, four weeks ago. Several of my friends locally are now
*07:08.240- 07:16.080* :  missing, possibly dead. I don't know. Even at that point, life had become desperate, surrounded by
*07:16.080- 07:22.220* :  devastation. The of my neighbor's homes were destroyed this morning by Israeli pumps,
*07:22.640- 07:28.440* :  and we are all having to evacuate our homes. There was no electricity. The water also
*07:28.440- 07:36.080* :  underground. Before the conflict, Farida was an English teacher, having studied at the Al-Azhar University
*07:36.120- 07:42.040* :  in Gaza City. Within a week, she left her home for the south with her brother and sister.
*07:42.460- 07:50.120* :  We are leaving now Gaza to other side because Israel is calling us to empty Gaza now.
*07:51.500- 07:59.580* :  Israel education, or targeting a lot of the streets, homes and mosques around us have the case.
*07:59.580- 08:07.680* :  Now it's very helpful. Without any transport, Farida was walking south for days.
*08:08.100- 08:16.900* :  I'm so devastated and exhausted. I ran out of words. I'm so frightened of what I've been now
*08:16.900- 08:25.980* :  around. A lot of moving around us and all the children are crying. We don't know where can we go.
*08:26.680- 08:32.560* :  A journey that was supposed to take Farida away from the fear she had in her home ended with nowhere
*08:32.560- 08:39.220* :  to call a home. We went to the UNRWA schools. We don't have any clear places there. We went to
*08:39.220- 08:45.940* :  the hospitals also. We don't have any place just to set a Israel occupation, make homes in
*08:45.940- 08:51.360* :  everywhere in Gaza. We don't have any safe places there because of that we're back to home.
*08:51.420- 09:01.400* :  Just to set our dignity and to have a place to stay. Walking south for a few days turned into
*09:01.400- 09:07.960* :  walking south. Then north, back again to Gaza City. I'm still alive but not okay because
*09:07.960- 09:16.700* :  still Israel is pumping everything around us. The pumps are very hard. They cut off everything's
*09:16.740- 09:22.340* :  on Gaza's to deny us from the rest of the world and let us just die even though that
*09:22.340- 09:29.580* :  engers people they are redid. They cut the whole electricity on Gaza's even though the hospitals
*09:29.580- 09:37.600* :  and street schools everything. Farida remains in Gaza City surrounded by the rubble of her
*09:37.600- 09:44.040* :  former life. Unable to seek refuge in the south. Unable to escape a constant flow of missiles
*09:44.040- 09:51.800* :  striking the family she once had. I've lost most of my family more than 18 members of my family.
*09:51.800- 10:01.100* :  I'm thinking about nowadays when now we will die. No one will know about our dying or what happened
*10:04.280- 10:11.380* :  in Gaza. Farida Adel Al Ghoul on life in war-torn Gaza. The US and China have confirmed that their
*10:11.380- 10:18.260* :  leaders Joe Biden and Xi Jinping will meet next week in the San Francisco Bay Area. The summit
*10:18.260- 10:24.500* :  will take place on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference. It will be
*10:24.500- 10:30.380* :  their second face-to-face meeting during the Biden presidency and follows a sharp deterioration
*10:30.380- 10:37.240* :  in relations earlier this year. From Washington, his Barbara Plattascha. The summit is important
*10:37.240- 10:42.260* :  but the goals are modest to manage the relationship by ensuring communication channels are open
*10:42.260- 10:48.080* :  set at US official. Especially those between the two militaries. China cut them off after then
*10:48.080- 10:54.580* :  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. The Biden administration has pressed to restore
*10:54.580- 10:59.720* :  them. It points in particular to the diplomatic crisis that erupted when it shot down an alleged
*10:59.720- 11:06.020* :  Chinese spy balloon earlier this year after Beijing refused to pick up the phone. Taiwan will be on
*11:06.020- 11:10.820* :  the agenda along with a host of other long-standing international and regional issues.
*11:11.860- 11:19.720* :  Barbara Plattascha. The Pacific Island Nation of Tuvalu is facing an uncertain future because of
*11:19.720- 11:26.420* :  global warming. It's predicted that because of rising sea levels, the entire archipelago will be
*11:26.420- 11:32.940* :  uninhabitable within the next 80 years. Two of the nine coral islands have already largely
*11:32.940- 11:39.900* :  disappeared. To safeguard their future, citizens of Tuvalu are being offered sanctuary in Australia.
*11:40.560- 11:46.660* :  Anthony Albanace, the Australian Prime Minister, said that his country had signed a landmark deal.
*11:47.240- 11:54.760* :  The treaty covers three main areas of cooperation. Climate change, human mobility and security.
*11:55.560- 12:02.720* :  Australia commits to provide assistance to Tuvalu in response to a major natural disaster,
*12:03.440- 12:10.080* :  to a health pandemic or to military aggression. Alex Richardson heard more from Phil Mercer in Sydney.
*12:10.580- 12:17.520* :  On the face of it, it seems a pretty modest scheme rather than a mass climate resettlement project.
*12:17.520- 12:25.700* :  280 people from Tuvalu will be allowed to live work and study in Australia each year.
*12:25.700- 12:32.600* :  This is out of a population of around 11,000 people. We understand, though, that this is the first
*12:32.600- 12:39.920* :  time the authorities in Canberra are offering some residents facing displacement due to global warming,
*12:39.920- 12:46.780* :  the opportunity to reset or in Australia, although the numbers, as we say, are relatively small.
*12:46.780- 12:53.540* :  The government in Tuvalu is warning that global warming poses an existential threat swallowed
*12:53.540- 13:00.660* :  by the mighty Pacific Ocean. So, some financial supporters, well, for reinforcements?
*13:01.180- 13:06.960* :  Yes, Australia is boosting its commitment to help Tuvalu try to stave off the worst
*13:06.960- 13:14.400* :  effects of climate change and sea level rises. Canberra is to spend another 10 million US dollars
*13:15.040- 13:21.340* :  to help Tuvalu reclaim land from the sea and boost coastal defenses, but, as you say,
*13:21.340- 13:28.460* :  there are dire forecasts that the entire South Pacific archipelago could be uninhabitable because
*13:28.460- 13:33.240* :  of global warming by the end of this century. And this is being seen by some as an attempt by
*13:33.240- 13:39.060* :  Australia to compensate for its reliance on coal and gas, which is hugely controversial in the
*13:39.060- 13:45.640* :  Pacific. Well, yes, in many ways, Australia has been regarded as a sort of a climate villain,
*13:45.640- 13:52.640* :  if you like, in the neighborhood in the past because of its reliance economically on fossil fuels,
*13:52.640- 13:59.500* :  but I think there's a very significant geopolitical element to this as well. This is an attempt
*13:59.500- 14:06.340* :  by Australia to counter China's growing influence in the region. Australia has regarded the
*14:06.340- 14:12.780* :  Pacific traditionally as its sphere of influence. Tuvalu recognizes Taiwan and, like most other
*14:12.780- 14:18.780* :  Pacific countries who have formal diplomatic relations with China. And, as we say, Australia
*14:18.780- 14:23.940* :  increasingly wary of Beijing's ambitions in the region. Phil Mercer
*14:27.200- 14:33.060* :  Still to come in the Global News podcast, the BBC investigates why so many people died in their
*14:33.060- 14:39.140* :  cars trying to flee a fire in the Hawaiian town of Lahaina. Once I saw the roadblock,
*14:39.140- 14:43.360* :  those people are on the road not because of a traffic jam, but because of one that's created
*14:43.360- 14:47.860* :  by our authorities. It's criminal, what happened? People lost their lives.
*14:56.780- 15:02.880* :  The UN Refugee Agency says it's gravely concerned about increasing fighting in Sudan's
*15:02.880- 15:11.380* :  Darfur region, between government troops and the paramilitary RSF. The UN HCR says the RSF
*15:11.380- 15:18.320* :  and its militia allies have killed more than 800 people in recent clashes. One local civic group
*15:18.320- 15:24.800* :  says the figure is even higher. I got more from our correspondent in the region, Calcutta Nyebertel.
*15:25.500- 15:29.300* :  Well, it seems that the latest fighting is concentrated in Western Darfur, and we are hearing
*15:29.300- 15:35.520* :  reports of atrocities, a large number of people being killed, and civilians are fleeing the area
*15:35.520- 15:41.000* :  in thousands crossing borders to neighbouring Chad. And those who cross the border into Chad are
*15:41.000- 15:46.320* :  telling the aid agencies some fairly horrifying things. Absolutely. This area has been, you know,
*15:46.600- 15:52.200* :  at the centre of reports and accusations of ethnic targeted attacks, particularly against
*15:52.740- 15:57.620* :  non-Arab tribes living in those areas. Rights groups as well as witnesses have been accusing
*15:57.620- 16:03.520* :  the RSF, as well as it's allied Arab militias of targeting these non-Arab communities,
*16:04.160- 16:10.620* :  and subjecting them to horrific violations, arbitrary killings, as well as sexual violence,
*16:11.320- 16:16.400* :  and similar abuse. So that's what we're hearing. The UN said that it's deeply alarmed by the
*16:16.400- 16:22.000* :  recent developments, and it seems that this conflict and its resulting humanitarian crisis
*16:22.540- 16:28.740* :  is not getting enough attention, as the world is distracted by other pressing crises across the
*16:28.740- 16:34.380* :  globe. And is either side gaining the upper hand in this conflict? Well, for the first few months
*16:34.380- 16:39.740* :  of the conflict, it seems that the fighting was rather balanced, particularly around the country's
*16:39.740- 16:45.460* :  capital, Hartoom, as well as in this Western Darfur area. But in recent weeks, we are seeing that
*16:45.460- 16:50.720* :  the RSF, the rapist support forces, this paramilitary group is gaining momentum, it's capturing
*16:50.860- 16:56.060* :  a number of military bases, as well as important cities and in the strategic areas,
*16:56.580- 17:00.100* :  but with its advances, these horrific reports are emerging.
*17:00.860- 17:05.280* :  Calcutta and Yubatal in Addis Ababa. The Turkish President,
*17:05.280- 17:12.020* :  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says he's prepared to change the constitution to end a dispute between
*17:12.020- 17:18.360* :  the country's highest courts. He's criticized Turkey's constitutional court, at a time when
*17:18.360- 17:24.080* :  its authority has been challenged by the country's top appeal court. A move expert, say,
*17:24.080- 17:30.760* :  is unprecedented. Danny Eberhardt has the details. President Erdogan has described himself as a
*17:30.760- 17:36.140* :  referee in the standoff between Turkey's two highest courts. But critics fear he won't be an
*17:36.140- 17:41.940* :  honest broker, having long accused him of politicising the judiciary. This dispute centers on a
*17:41.940- 17:47.520* :  case involving a lawyer, Jan Attalai, jailed last year for his role in major protests against Mr.
*17:47.520- 17:53.280* :  Erdogan's government a decade ago. He was subsequently elected to Parliament. Because of this,
*17:53.280- 17:58.780* :  the constitutional court recently ruled he should be released. The Supreme Appeals Court has not
*17:58.780- 18:03.920* :  implemented the ruling, and has countered by filial criminal complaint against the constitutional
*18:03.920- 18:09.900* :  court judges who made it. Mr. Erdogan appears to side with the appeals court. He's criticised
*18:09.900- 18:15.380* :  the constitutional court alleging it's made many mistakes, and he raised the prospect of further
*18:15.380- 18:24.600* :  constitutional change. We don't look at the latest dispute from the perspective of who is right
*18:24.600- 18:32.860* :  or who is wrong, but what needs to be done to solve this issue. When we look at it from this angle,
*18:32.860- 18:39.180* :  we see the necessity for our country to obtain a new constitution as soon as possible.
*18:39.760- 18:45.160* :  The appeal court's move has sparked demonstrations by Turkey's main opposition party and members of
*18:45.160- 18:50.600* :  the legal profession. Hundreds of lawyers marched to its premises in Ankara, chanting for justice.
*18:53.900- 18:57.780* :  They placed copies of the constitution on the fence surrounding the court in protest.
*18:58.760- 19:04.540* :  This Doctor of Constitutional Law, Serkan Koybashir, explained the seriousness of the situation.
*19:06.940- 19:12.100* :  You might not like the constitutional court's decision, you can criticise it, but saying
*19:12.100- 19:17.500* :  I'm not implementing this means not accepting the supremacy of the constitutional court and the
*19:17.500- 19:22.960* :  constitution in this country. This would mean suspending the constitution. When you suspend the
*19:22.960- 19:28.020* :  constitution, you are suspending the state. You are suspending the judicial system.
*19:28.460- 19:33.080* :  How the crisis is resolved and what this means for judicial independence and the separation of
*19:33.080- 19:38.700* :  powers will be scrutinised, not just in Turkey, but abroad too. Dany Abraham.
*19:40.020- 19:46.120* :  A fire in August destroyed most of the historic Hawaiian town of Lahaina, which cost the lives
*19:46.120- 19:51.860* :  of nearly 100 people. Many of the dead were killed in their cars as they tried to escape.
*19:53.000- 19:59.360* :  How could a fire next to the ocean turn so deadly? The BBC's James Clayton has been to Hawaii
*19:59.840- 20:01.700* :  to investigate what happened that day.
*20:03.580- 20:09.120* :  The wind that day was intense when a fire began to the east of the Hawaiian town of Lahaina.
*20:10.380- 20:15.960* :  Ui Kahoo'e was watching the wind rip through her home and tear off her neighbour's roof.
*20:17.880- 20:22.220* :  You saw the grey smoke and within minutes it turned into this big black ugly smoke.
*20:23.800- 20:30.380* :  Ui decides she has to flee by car, but she's met by a huge traffic jam. She sees smoke in
*20:30.380- 20:38.400* :  gulf in cars. In my review I can see headlights disappear into the black smoke and I'm thinking to
*20:38.400- 20:43.800* :  myself, we're not moving fast enough. We've got to get out of here. There's people back there.
*20:43.980- 20:50.280* :  It just went on until it disappeared. Many people had to abandon their vehicles and then to the sea
*20:50.280- 20:56.640* :  to survive. Everybody's got to evacuate, evacuate now. The BBC has obtained police body
*20:56.640- 21:01.500* :  cam footage that shows that even the police were exasperated about the traffic jams.
*21:09.000- 21:13.020* :  Why the traffic was moving so slowly is something we've tried to find out.
*21:13.700- 21:19.000* :  For sure some roads were blocked because of fallen debris, but other roads were blocked by the
*21:19.000- 21:24.780* :  police due to downed power lines and a fear of electrocution. This is the chief of the police
*21:24.780- 21:31.080* :  John Pelletier speaking a few days after the fire. We did not close your forbid people from
*21:31.080- 21:35.140* :  getting out of Lahaina. If there's a downed power line, we want to make sure that you
*21:35.140- 21:40.900* :  didn't go over a downed live power line. However, Hawaiian Electric, the local electricity provider,
*21:40.900- 21:47.180* :  has told the BBC that the power lines were not energized during the fire and that it told the police
*21:47.180- 21:53.060* :  numerous times throughout the day that they were de-energized. This is a recording of such a
*22:09.280- 22:13.820* :  conversation given to the BBC. The police, however, have told the BBC that the company did not give
*22:13.820- 22:20.220* :  clear and definitive confirmation that the lines were de-energized. The result was the police
*22:20.220- 22:30.260* :  treating lines as live and blocking roads. One witness, Travis Miller, showed the BBC his footage he
*22:30.260- 22:35.860* :  filmed of the main road going north out of the city blocked for hours by the police.
*22:36.280- 22:41.660* :  I knew once I saw the roadblock, this is insane. Those people are on the road not because of a
*22:41.660- 22:48.820* :  traffic jam, but because of one that's created by our authorities. I feel like it's criminal,
*22:48.820- 22:52.560* :  what happened? People lost their lives, that wouldn't have lost their lives.
*22:53.560- 22:58.540* :  The mayor of Maui, Richard Bissen, told the BBC the town should have been better prepared.
*22:59.200- 23:06.160* :  That's what everybody is pointing to, better response, just a better awareness of the dangers we
*23:06.360- 23:10.500* :  face. And who should take responsibility for that? We also think responsibly.
*23:11.400- 23:17.420* :  At least 99 people lost their lives that day and authorities are still trying to identify
*23:17.420- 23:23.000* :  remains using DNA technology. You can see more from James Clayton on the BBC
*23:23.000- 23:30.300* :  news channel on Saturday, our world escape from Lahaina. The family of a young Japanese actor
*23:30.300- 23:35.600* :  who apparently took her own life in September have been speaking out about her poor treatment
*23:35.600- 23:41.340* :  and long hours while working for one of Japan's most popular entertainment companies.
*23:42.220- 23:49.760* :  The Takarazuka review is an all-female musical theatre troupe with women often playing male roles.
*23:50.600- 23:56.440* :  It's tough to get in, thousands apply, and this is from their show a second fortuitous meeting.
*24:07.860- 24:12.040* :  So what may have been the main complaint from the actors' family? I got the details
*24:12.040- 24:17.100* :  from our reporter, Willie and Ardo. This is the tragic story of this 25-year-old actress.
*24:17.360- 24:21.540* :  As she's not being named, she was in her seventh year with the troupe she was found dead in her
*24:21.540- 24:26.760* :  apartment on the 30th of September by a parent's suicide. Today, at the press conference,
*24:26.800- 24:32.560* :  the lead family lawyer detailed accusations that paint a grim picture of a life of stress and
*24:32.560- 24:36.740* :  bullying for this actress, really. He said that she'd recently taken on a role as a coordinator
*24:36.740- 24:42.380* :  for junior members. She'd worked 250 hours over time in a month, getting them ready for later
*24:42.380- 24:46.960* :  performances. So some nights, there's just as she got maybe three hours sleep if she was lucky.
*24:47.120- 24:51.520* :  They also said that she'd been verbally and physically abused by her superiors. They'd
*24:51.520- 24:55.380* :  been blaming her according to this lawyer for failings by those that she was meant to be looking
*24:55.380- 24:58.900* :  after as her juniors. There was one incident where she was alleged to have been burnt on a
*24:58.900- 25:03.280* :  forehead by a hair iron. The company denied this when there was reported a few weeks ago in a
*25:03.280- 25:08.560* :  Japanese magazine, but it's being looked into again. The family wanted an apology from the company
*25:08.560- 25:13.240* :  and they say the bullying colleagues and financial damages. It's worth noting that Takarazog
*25:13.240- 25:17.120* :  the company have said that they've taken on the statement and the family's concerns with
*25:17.120- 25:21.960* :  sincerity and that an investigation is still ongoing. How significant is this theatre trip?
*25:22.140- 25:26.860* :  It's huge. It's a kind of uniquely Japanese theatre company. It draws tens of thousands of
*25:26.860- 25:32.840* :  people to relatively nondescript city in western Japan called Takarazog. And they perform
*25:32.840- 25:37.580* :  kind of western classics as well as Japanese folklore. It's huge ensemble cast, amazing music,
*25:37.580- 25:41.980* :  amazing costumes, but the key thing in all the performers are women and that's very rare in the
*25:41.980- 25:45.780* :  world. The actresses often live in their kind of adopted genders. They speak like men throughout
*25:45.780- 25:50.440* :  the rehearsals and Japanese quite a gendered language, for example. It was founded in 1913 by
*25:50.440- 25:54.200* :  a railway boss who wanted to bring customers to the end of one of his railway lines, which is
*25:54.260- 25:58.160* :  Takarazog as a city. Unsurprisingly, it's very popular among women has been kind of lauded for that,
*25:58.160- 26:02.600* :  but that seen by some is a sort of finishing school. It's very competitive to get into and once
*26:02.600- 26:07.980* :  you're in, it's rigid and hierarchical, suggested, for example, or reported that first years are
*26:07.980- 26:13.660* :  made to clean by hand the premises every day. And there have been a number of scandals in the
*26:13.660- 26:20.980* :  Japanese entertainment industry in recent years. Are Japanese people becoming more vocal in accentuating
*26:20.980- 26:25.660* :  these concerns? The key scandal that's been coming out over the past few months is this
*26:26.040- 26:30.600* :  talent agency, Johnny's Associates, which was founded by Johnny Kitagawa, who died a few years
*26:30.600- 26:34.500* :  ago, but it turned out over the course of decades that had been accusations building up against him
*26:34.500- 26:39.980* :  of abuse towards minors. So there was a pool of silence around his activities until quite recently.
*26:40.200- 26:45.080* :  And I feel like that has probably sparked a word of conversation about how talent are treated
*26:45.080- 26:48.160* :  within Japan, and whether that's actually good for the people who are involved.
*26:48.160- 26:55.340* :  Will Leonardo. Let's return to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. On Friday, Palestinian officials
*26:55.340- 27:01.300* :  said Israeli strikes had hit three hospitals and a schooling Gaza killing more than 20 people.
*27:01.940- 27:07.740* :  The international Red Cross has warned that hospitals in Gaza have reached a point of no return.
*27:08.720- 27:13.020* :  And Israeli army spokesman has said that its soldiers do not fire on hospitals,
*27:13.100- 27:19.100* :  but if they see Hamas militants shooting from them, they'll kill them. A spokesperson for the
*27:19.100- 27:24.860* :  World Health Organization, Margaret Harris, told the BBC that attacks on health care facilities
*27:25.520- 27:30.900* :  must stop. We've documented over a hundred attacks on health care, I should say. It's beyond
*27:30.900- 27:37.240* :  hospitals. It's also ambulances, health care personnel and 16 health care personnel have lost
*27:37.240- 27:44.520* :  their lives. Well, on duty, but 192 have lost their lives overall. And we've seen a hundred
*27:44.960- 27:52.460* :  UN aid workers lose their lives. We don't say who did what, but all I can say is this violence
*27:53.140- 28:00.020* :  is causing massive loss of life. We've got to be able to do better than this. We must be able to
*28:00.020- 28:05.220* :  stop. The Israeli Defence Force says it has urged civilians to move away from the hospitals.
*28:05.940- 28:12.900* :  Daniel Hagarri, a spokesman for the Israeli military, says more than 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza
*28:12.900- 28:18.940* :  have moved from the north to the south of the strip in the past two days. The Hamas run health
*28:18.940- 28:25.100* :  authorities in Gaza now say more than 11,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive.
*28:25.940- 28:31.580* :  On Thursday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, hosted a conference in Paris aimed at
*28:31.580- 28:37.340* :  coordinating aid for Gaza. On Friday, he spoke to our European editor, Katya Adler,
*28:37.760- 28:42.300* :  about the ongoing conflict and the sentiments that were expressed at the conference.
*28:55.660- 29:02.120* :  But day one, we say that this reaction and the fight against terrorism, because it is led by a
*29:02.120- 29:07.600* :  democracy, should be compliant with international rules, all of war, and humanitarian international
*29:07.600- 29:14.840* :  law. And day after day, what we saw is a permanent bombing of civilians in Gaza. We discussed
*29:14.840- 29:19.980* :  about safe zones, about the south of Gaza. We discussed with the Japan zone. And the clear
*29:19.980- 29:26.800* :  conclusion of everybody during the humanitarian conference, from United Nations to NGOs,
*29:26.800- 29:33.200* :  to all the governments being present is that there is no other solution than first a humanitarian
*29:33.200- 29:39.200* :  pose going to a ceasefire, which will allow to take care of people being in hospitals,
*29:40.340- 29:47.640* :  and to protect babies, ladies, all the civilians having nothing to deal with the terrorists.
*29:48.140- 29:53.160* :  Do you think Israel is respecting those rules, the international rules that you're referring to?
*29:53.160- 29:58.700* :  The factor is not the case, and I do regret it. And we do share the pain, and we do share the
*29:58.700- 30:05.600* :  willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France. But I think there is
*30:05.600- 30:12.240* :  no justification to attack civilians. There is no justification to make a distinction between
*30:12.240- 30:17.540* :  the different lives. Pedestrian lives do matter. This is why I do call for
*30:18.040- 30:23.540* :  the immediate humanitarian pose, and a rapid ceasefire precisely to protect civilians.
*30:24.520- 30:29.720* :  We know the solution, the two states approach. We know the different treaties and negotiations
*30:29.780- 30:36.360* :  having decided such an approach. I mean, it was not implemented. If you want them to condemn very
*30:36.360- 30:42.980* :  clearly any type of violence, you have to demonstrate the fact that there is no other way out
*30:42.980- 30:49.100* :  than violence, which is precisely a political process. So security and fight against terrorism,
*30:49.860- 30:56.180* :  humanitarian protection, and all lives matter, and a political process with the two states
*30:56.180- 31:02.600* :  solutions. This is how I see. Are you saying that Israel is guilty of breaking international humanitarian
*31:03.100- 31:08.680* :  law? I think it's not the proper way to approach a question. We do recognize the right to protect
*31:08.680- 31:15.280* :  themselves. We do contest the fact that the better way to protect self is having the large
*31:15.280- 31:20.340* :  bombing of Gaza. We are ready to cooperate, to help in order to fight against terror.
*31:20.900- 31:26.700* :  But we do urge them to stop this bombing. The factor to the civilians are bombed.
*31:27.060- 31:31.460* :  The fact is, these babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed.
*31:32.300- 31:37.640* :  There is no reason for that unknowledge. So we do urge Israel to stop.
*31:38.440- 31:44.260* :  I'm not a judge. I'm a head of state. I think now it's time for ceasefire.
*31:44.920- 31:48.860* :  French President Emmanuel Macron speaking to Katya Adler.
*31:52.100- 31:56.580* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new addition of the global news podcast
*31:56.580- 32:03.660* :  at the same time tomorrow. But later on Saturday, you can hear the happy part, a selection of our
*32:03.660- 32:09.640* :  favorite positive news stories with Harry Bly. Yes, we've got a common theme in this episode.
*32:09.640- 32:15.660* :  Birds will meet the biologist who's dedicated his life to protecting penguins in South America
*32:15.660- 32:21.920* :  and beyond. A woman in Mexico who's given her time and her home to hummingbirds and the world's
*32:21.920- 32:27.860* :  oldest chicken called peanut, uplifting news from around the world in this podcast feed every Saturday.
*32:28.820- 32:35.060* :  This addition was mixed by Mike Campbell. The producer was Emma Joseph. The editor is Karen Martin.
*32:35.560- 32:38.380* :  I'm Nigel Adlerley. Until next time, goodbye.
