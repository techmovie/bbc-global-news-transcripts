*00:49.800- 00:52.920* :  You're listening to the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:54.920- 01:00.200* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. We are recording this at 14 hours GMT on Monday, the 27th of November.
*01:00.200- 01:06.560* :  Pressure mounts on Israel and Hamas to extend their temporary truce in Gaza. Environmental activists say
*01:06.560- 01:11.720* :  they're shocked at claims the UAE has used its role as host of UN climate talks to discuss oil
*01:11.720- 01:17.780* :  and gas deals. And six former pupils at a school in France go on trial over the beheading of a teacher.
*01:20.080- 01:25.520* :  Also in the podcast, Chinese family seek compensation nearly a decade after the disappearance of flight
*01:25.520- 01:34.160* :  MH370. After 10 years, the court has finally opened the hearing. I hope that the legal relief
*01:34.160- 01:39.340* :  can be realized as soon as possible. And New Zealand's new centre-right government
*01:39.340- 01:41.300* :  scraps the country's smoking ban.
*01:45.020- 01:51.160* :  The four-day truce between Israel and Hamas is reportedly due to end at 7am local time tomorrow.
*01:51.160- 01:57.200* :  But both sides say they are willing to extend it. The fourth and final hostage and
*01:57.200- 02:02.260* :  prisoner swap of the original deal is due today, though there have been reports of minor issues
*02:02.260- 02:07.960* :  over who will be included. If the exchange does go ahead, it will mean that 50 Israeli hostages
*02:07.960- 02:14.100* :  will have been released over four days in return for 150 Palestinian prisoners, all women and
*02:14.100- 02:20.300* :  children. Hamas also released a number of foreign workers. Speaking in Spain, the Palestinian foreign
*02:20.300- 02:25.260* :  minister, Riyadh Al Maliki, said there is broad support for a continuation of the ceasefire agreement.
*02:29.280- 02:34.880* :  The Qataris, the Egyptians, the United States, the European Union, Spain, Palestine,
*02:35.700- 02:39.540* :  were all working to extend that truce by one day, two days, three days.
*02:40.500- 02:45.500* :  The most important thing is to continue extending the truce, because that means stopping the killing.
*02:46.060- 02:50.860* :  But the Israeli government spokesman Alon Levy said at a news conference in Tel Aviv,
*02:51.120- 02:53.960* :  that depended on Hamas freeing more hostages.
*02:54.420- 02:58.160* :  The framework remains in place for the release of more hostages.
*02:58.580- 03:05.360* :  After tonight's batch, providing an additional one day of hostage release pause for every 10
*03:05.360- 03:11.440* :  additional hostages who are released. When Hamas stops releasing hostages under the existing
*03:11.440- 03:17.760* :  framework, Israel will return to realizing our three goals with full force, eliminating Hamas,
*03:17.760- 03:22.440* :  ensuring that Gaza never again pose a threat to the people of Israel and, of course,
*03:22.440- 03:24.540* :  releasing all of our hostages.
*03:24.980- 03:29.400* :  Well, our Middle East affairs analyst Sebastian Asher told me there was still some uncertainty
*03:29.400- 03:34.540* :  over the latest prisoner swap. The Israeli Prime Minister's office is just released a statement
*03:35.400- 03:42.300* :  saying that the negotiations over the list of this fourth group of hostages is continuing
*03:42.960- 03:47.620* :  and saying that the office is aware of the stress that the families involved are under,
*03:48.300- 03:53.720* :  and that information will be added when it becomes possible, and also makes a plea to avoid
*03:53.720- 03:59.860* :  spreading rumors and unreliable information. I mean, it's unclear exactly what the sticking point
*03:59.860- 04:06.000* :  is, but it seems for me Israeli side that it may be to do with separation of families of hostages
*04:06.000- 04:10.980* :  that some people are being released while other members of their families remain behind
*04:11.820- 04:19.560* :  with Hamas in Gaza. And from the other perspective, the Hamas side, they have issues over the latest
*04:19.560- 04:24.960* :  list of prisoners who are due to be released by Israel. We've seen over the past three days.
*04:25.740- 04:32.660* :  On the first two days, it was mainly women prisoners and boys and teenagers under 19 being
*04:32.660- 04:39.260* :  free. Yesterday, it was almost all teenage boys. So it looks as if the number of women that are left
*04:39.260- 04:47.720* :  to be released by Israel is almost at its end. And there's some dispute, some discussion over
*04:48.300- 04:53.760* :  the standing of the prisoners who will be released. Now, Hamas obviously wants more significant
*04:53.760- 04:58.700* :  prisoners to be released if possible during this round. Yeah, I mean, we saw some delays on Saturday,
*04:58.700- 05:04.200* :  which were eventually resolved. But let's look at the bigger issue, the chances of an extension.
*05:04.300- 05:11.420* :  I see that Egyptian, Katari and US negotiators are reported to be close to agreeing a continuation
*05:11.680- 05:14.680* :  of the truth. But then we have heard those kind of things before. What do you make of it all?
*05:15.360- 05:21.460* :  We have. I mean, this particular report is sourced on three Egyptian unnamed security sources.
*05:22.060- 05:26.080* :  I mean, the Egyptians have been very much involved in mediation, but we have had, as you've said,
*05:26.820- 05:32.020* :  some misinformation that has come out from various sources. So we need to be cautious about this.
*05:32.380- 05:37.860* :  But there's no doubt that the international pressure on Israel in particular from its allies
*05:38.520- 05:42.180* :  is growing for the extension. We've heard it from President Biden. We've heard it from other
*05:42.180- 05:50.160* :  senior US officials. We've heard it today from the head of NATO, all essentially united in saying
*05:50.160- 05:56.620* :  that they want to see the ceasefire extended at least to some extent. I mean, what you were hearing
*05:56.620- 06:03.540* :  there from me, Israeli spokesman, Elon Levy, was the Israeli stance that they accept an extension
*06:03.540- 06:09.700* :  if it's done on a day-by-day basis. And as long as Hamas continues to release 10 hostages a day
*06:09.700- 06:15.500* :  from Hamas perspective, what we understand is that they want a longer extension agreed from the
*06:15.500- 06:20.480* :  start another four day extension. So obviously, there'd be major issues over that. But I mean,
*06:20.480- 06:27.140* :  my feeling is that an extension is more like even not at the moment. Sebastian Asha. So US, NATO,
*06:27.140- 06:33.160* :  and EU officials are all hopeful that an extension to the truth can be reached. And leaders in the
*06:33.160- 06:38.740* :  Arab world are watching closely too, as our security correspondent Frank Gardner told Michelle Hussein.
*06:39.320- 06:44.300* :  Every country in the Middle East, apart from Israel, would like this truth to become a permanent
*06:44.300- 06:49.060* :  ceasefire. Leaders in the region, ministers, people I've spoken to are very concerned that
*06:49.880- 06:55.140* :  if the war continues, it could actually radicalize a lot of populations in the region because
*06:55.140- 07:00.740* :  people are watching it live on their televisions and they're appalled by it. Israel's view is that
*07:01.040- 07:06.420* :  if Hamas is allowed to retain a military capacity, it will simply repeat what it did on October
*07:06.420- 07:13.500* :  the 7th. But in the meantime, there are still 180 hostages roughly that are left in Gaza.
*07:14.240- 07:21.540* :  There is a possibility of being able to get more out and stay off Israel's resumption of the war,
*07:21.920- 07:27.860* :  probably for about two, three, maybe four more days. After that, it looks like Israel is determined
*07:27.860- 07:34.780* :  to continue this war. And would Hamas also keep some hostages? I mean, that in the terrible dynamics
*07:34.780- 07:41.200* :  of this, that is its leverage. Yeah, I mean, the hardest negotiations, Michelle, are going to come
*07:41.200- 07:48.740* :  over the military hostages that Hamas seized, the members of the Israel Defense Forces, both men
*07:48.740- 07:53.740* :  and women, they will almost certainly demand a very high price for them. In other words, a large
*07:53.740- 07:58.740* :  number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails much larger than we've seen already.
*07:59.660- 08:05.080* :  I think we kind of tend to over generalize that that raid on October the 7th, we call it the
*08:05.080- 08:10.660* :  Hamas raid, but it wasn't just Hamas. It was members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is another
*08:10.660- 08:17.760* :  militant group there, and even private individuals gangs basically that just went in and rampage
*08:17.760- 08:23.700* :  through southern Israel. And part of the problem now is that Hamas is saying, look, we need more time
*08:24.420- 08:28.500* :  because they've got to try and find these hostages that are hidden with other people in Gaza.
*08:28.960- 08:33.640* :  Frank Gardner, well, whatever happens, with the truth, the people of Gaza are suffering the
*08:33.640- 08:39.260* :  effects of seven weeks of Israeli bombardment launched after the Hamas atrocities of the 7th of October.
*08:39.880- 08:45.300* :  The BBC's just in web has been talking to James Elder from UNICEF who is currently in northern Gaza.
*08:45.820- 08:51.440* :  The whole place and the people, they just bear the marks of immense distress, of trauma,
*08:51.440- 08:57.480* :  street after street, reduced to rubble, children with the most horrendous wounds of war, both inside
*08:57.480- 09:02.540* :  the hospital emergency wards, but makeshift emergency wards outside in the car park, outside in the
*09:02.540- 09:08.800* :  garden. And this, of course, is during a humanitarian pause. And a pause that may not last beyond
*09:08.800- 09:15.580* :  tonight? Exactly. This is what we quite frequently hear. And that, of course, would just have utterly
*09:15.580- 09:21.420* :  disastrous consequences for people here, as ever, with children bearing the burns. When a
*09:21.420- 09:26.260* :  bomb or a mortar hits an apartment block just in a child is there, they get multiple injuries.
*09:26.260- 09:31.480* :  It's broken bones. It's also strapped, of course, blast, which is often to the eyes.
*09:32.000- 09:36.900* :  And then, of course, horrendous burns, just children after children with this. I've never seen
*09:36.900- 09:42.500* :  the scale before. So what would you say to Hamas? Because, of course, it could continue if they
*09:42.500- 09:48.580* :  let out more hostages. What is the UN saying to Hamas? UNICEF has said from day one, released these
*09:48.580- 09:55.420* :  children, and the torment that their parents must feel, the fam, the wider family, is beyond the
*09:55.420- 10:02.220* :  pale. So it's magnificent news that some, not enough, not all have been released. It's terrific
*10:02.220- 10:06.920* :  to bring back children who've been detained in Israel. But again, when we can talk with these
*10:06.920- 10:11.720* :  things, we talk of hostages and children, and we talk of them many thousands who have been killed,
*10:11.720- 10:17.020* :  and apparently the world is happy to watch that number added to. It just underlines this,
*10:17.520- 10:23.500* :  this is a war on children. I defer to someone who's here, a Palestinian woman I spoke to yesterday,
*10:23.500- 10:29.080* :  Justin, a hospital administrator in her 70s, and she talked to me about what she's been enduring,
*10:29.080- 10:33.740* :  living in a church with a hundred people, and so on. And she simply said, it seems to me, James,
*10:33.740- 10:39.280* :  that my final days will be in hell. But what about the children? James Elder from UNICEF,
*10:39.280- 10:44.760* :  talking to us from Gaza. The choice of the United Arab Emirates as host
*10:44.760- 10:49.600* :  for COP28, this year's UN Climate Talks, has been controversial from the start.
*10:49.600- 10:55.500* :  Now, leaked documents obtained by the BBC suggest that the UAE planned to use its role
*10:55.500- 11:01.020* :  as an opportunity to discuss oil deals. Environmental activists say the allegations, if true,
*11:01.020- 11:05.780* :  are a scandal. The UAE's team didn't deny using COP meetings for business talks,
*11:05.780- 11:10.500* :  but said they were fully focused on, quote, meaningful climate action. Our climate editor,
*11:10.500- 11:19.500* :  Justin Rolatt, has this report. Now, more than ever, we need to unite on climate and deliver
*11:19.500- 11:27.520* :  a clear message of hope. Dr. Sultan Al-Jaba appointed the president of COP28 by the UAE
*11:27.520- 11:32.640* :  was building ambition at a meeting of environment ministers from around the world last month.
*11:32.640- 11:40.140* :  And we must deliver in Dubai. But Mr. Jaba is also the head of ATNOC, the UAE's
*11:40.140- 11:47.000* :  huge state oil company and its renewable energy business Mazda. Now, working alongside
*11:47.000- 11:52.800* :  independent journalists at the centre for climate reporting, we've got hold of briefing
*11:52.800- 11:59.660* :  documents prepared by the UAE's COP28 team ahead of meetings with 27 foreign governments.
*11:59.660- 12:05.440* :  They show Dr. Jaba was briefed to discuss business deals for the state firms. Now, I've got
*12:05.440- 12:14.160* :  the documents here and they suggest, telling China that the UAE's oil company is willing to
*12:14.160- 12:21.540* :  jointly evaluate liquefied natural gas opportunities in Mozambique, Canada, on Australia. The
*12:21.540- 12:28.080* :  Brazilian environment minister was to be asked to help with the UAE's multi-billion dollar bid
*12:28.080- 12:35.560* :  for a Brazilian oil and gas processing company. Now, attempting to do business deals especially
*12:35.560- 12:42.680* :  oil and gas deals during the COP process appears to be a serious breach of the standards
*12:42.680- 12:50.220* :  the UN expects of a COP president. It told the BBC a president should be impartial and act without
*12:50.220- 12:57.220* :  bias or self-interest. Professor Michael Jacobs of Sheffield University is an expert on UN
*12:57.220- 13:03.180* :  climate politics. This looks breathtakingly hypocritical, but I actually think it's worse than that
*13:04.060- 13:10.500* :  because the UAE at the moment is the custodian of a United Nations process aimed at reducing
*13:10.500- 13:17.140* :  global emissions. And yet in the very same meetings, it's actually trying to do side deals which
*13:17.140- 13:25.460* :  will increase global emissions. He had not HQ 65 stories high dominates the skyline of Abu Dhabi.
*13:28.480- 13:33.360* :  We know, on at least one occasion, a country followed up on a potential fossil fuel deal
*13:33.360- 13:40.280* :  brought up in a meeting arranged by the UAE's COP28 team. But 12 countries have told the BBC that
*13:40.280- 13:45.640* :  was either no discussion of commercial activities during meetings or a meeting did not take place.
*13:45.980- 13:50.800* :  I think what's really exciting about this is that he's a CEO and he brings us CEO mentality.
*13:51.240- 13:57.880* :  I questioned the director general of the UAE's COP28 team Majid Al Suhadi at a press conference
*13:57.880- 14:03.540* :  in Abu Dhabi last month. Mr Majid, as you know, there is some anxiety about an oil executive
*14:03.540- 14:08.560* :  being put in charge of a climate conference. What would you say to reassure people of the
*14:08.560- 14:15.200* :  independence of COP28 from Adnoch? Our team is fully independent. We are very confident
*14:15.540- 14:21.060* :  that our team is focused on delivering COP28, is focused on delivering the great exhaust
*14:21.660- 14:29.100* :  that we need to do. The COP28 team did not deny using climate meetings to discuss fossil fuel
*14:29.100- 14:34.300* :  deals. It told the BBC, private meetings are private and we do not comment on them.
*14:34.480- 14:40.420* :  Iang Manuel Puygarvidal, this former COP president is worried a collapsing trust could mean
*14:40.420- 14:46.540* :  no progress on tackling climate change on Dubai. The president of the COP, it is the leader of the
*14:46.540- 14:51.860* :  world. It is trying to build consensus on behalf of the planet. If any president of the COP
*14:52.460- 14:58.300* :  tried to bring a particular interest that it could be one country or one commercial interest,
*14:58.980- 15:01.500* :  that immediately could mean a failure of that COP.
*15:01.940- 15:06.340* :  The former COP president Manuel Puygarvidal ending that report by Justin Rowlett.
*15:08.560- 15:10.680* :  And still to come on the global news podcast?
*15:10.680- 15:16.980* :  There's a battle online to control the narrative, to influence opinions on losses and suffering,
*15:16.980- 15:24.840* :  rights and wrongs, facts and fake news. How the Israel-Garza war is being fought on social media.
*15:29.340- 15:33.480* :  Power cuts have become a frequent problem in Ukraine since Russia's invasion with
*15:33.480- 15:39.020* :  airstrikes and other attacks damaging energy infrastructure. But now, nature is making matters
*15:39.020- 15:45.080* :  worse after a major storm left 2 million people without electricity, including in Russian occupied
*15:45.080- 15:49.560* :  Crimea. Heavy snow has blocked roads and flooding has forced people from their homes.
*15:49.560- 15:54.400* :  While in the south of Ukraine, winds have up to 160 kilometers an hour were reported.
*15:54.400- 15:57.600* :  I spoke to our correspondent in Kiev, James Waterhouse.
*15:58.080- 16:04.640* :  Here in Kiev, there are definitely high winds. It's been especially cold and from the capital,
*16:04.640- 16:10.340* :  it's almost bittersweet because the high winds make the chances of drone strikes by Russia
*16:10.340- 16:15.780* :  a little bit less likely because their desired targets might be harder to hit. But as you say,
*16:15.780- 16:22.340* :  this is a cruel hand from nature, if you like, where we've seen reports of widespread reports of
*16:22.340- 16:29.680* :  hypothermia. We've seen emergency crews, tow and countless vehicles from the snow. It's around
*16:29.680- 16:35.100* :  this sort of southern Adessa and Mika live regions where difficulties are being most acutely
*16:35.560- 16:40.980* :  felt. But of course, we're talking about Russian occupied territory too. Many will remember the
*16:41.040- 16:47.240* :  city of Matayupo, which was labelled brutally to siege last year. There have been damaged buildings
*16:47.240- 16:53.240* :  there and in Crimea itself, Moscow installed officials declaring a state of emergency, they've
*16:53.240- 16:59.620* :  been evacuating people after coastal flooding, as well as a river bursting its banks. So it's
*16:59.620- 17:04.440* :  an incredibly desperate situation. And of course, we're talking about all of these civilian
*17:04.440- 17:09.540* :  implications, but of course, it makes the front line all the more desperate as well for the soldiers
*17:09.540- 17:14.440* :  fighting the fight. Yeah, and for both civilians and soldiers, it's obviously the last thing they
*17:14.440- 17:22.460* :  want after 21 months of conflict. Absolutely. And I think this time last year, cities like Kiev were
*17:22.460- 17:27.580* :  getting pummeled with Russian missiles and drones as Moscow embarked on this strategy of trying to
*17:27.580- 17:31.820* :  target infrastructure. And I think there's been a bit of a muscle memory this time around, where
*17:31.820- 17:37.140* :  with the winter starts to bite. And it bites quickly in this part of the world. Many were fearing
*17:37.140- 17:41.940* :  that Russia would resume its tactic again. We had a weekend where Kiev faced more drones than
*17:41.940- 17:48.300* :  since the start of the full scale invasion. Air defenses have improved drastically, but of course,
*17:48.300- 17:52.260* :  not everything is in Ukraine's control, as we've seen today and overnight.
*17:52.760- 17:58.540* :  Our correspondents and give James Waterhouse. In October 2020, France was shocked by the
*17:58.540- 18:03.260* :  beheading of a teacher called Samuel Patti, after he showed his class caricatures of the Islamic
*18:03.260- 18:09.220* :  Prophet Muhammad. The attacker, an 18-year-old Chechen refugee, was shot dead by police near the school
*18:09.220- 18:14.800* :  in a Paris suburb. Six teenagers who were pupils at the time of the killing have now gone on trial
*18:14.800- 18:20.260* :  over their actions in the lead-up to the murder. Our Paris correspondent Hugh Scofield told me more about
*18:20.260- 18:26.120* :  the accused. We can split into two groups. Group of five and one other, the five, are accused of
*18:26.120- 18:32.220* :  identifying Samuel Patti to the killer, Alex Anzerov, on the afternoon when he came to the school. He
*18:32.220- 18:37.880* :  decided that he wanted to do a recvengence on Samuel Patti for allegedly having shown these
*18:37.880- 18:42.520* :  caricatures, but he didn't know who he was. He didn't know what he looked like, so he needed the
*18:42.520- 18:49.660* :  help of pupils and the approach one with some money. That pupil took the money and then shared
*18:49.660- 18:54.100* :  it with some friends and they did what they were asked to do and identified the teacher.
*18:54.620- 18:59.640* :  The other pupil is a girl whose lie at the beginning of all this started the terrible train of
*19:00.060- 19:06.340* :  events because she told her father, wrongly, that she'd been in the class where the cartoon was
*19:06.740- 19:11.560* :  shown. In fact, she hadn't been in that class at all. She'd been suspended because of misbehavior
*19:11.800- 19:16.940* :  and she made an excuse to her father by saying, oh, I was kicked out of this, I protested in this
*19:16.940- 19:22.000* :  class about the showing of the cartoon. It was a lie, but her father got very angry and then started
*19:22.000- 19:28.040* :  the online campaign against the teacher, which then made its way to the killer Abdelak Anzerov.
*19:28.260- 19:33.400* :  Yeah, I mean, a terrible tragedy spiraling out of the actions of these youngsters.
*19:34.400- 19:39.220* :  Indeed, indeed, I mean, the defence clearly is going to be that we couldn't possibly have known
*19:39.220- 19:44.440* :  what was going to happen, and I dare say that will be taken into account. And the five
*19:44.860- 19:48.960* :  who are accused of identifying Patti aren't accused of it, assistance in a murder, there are
*19:49.580- 19:54.360* :  accused of complicity in an act of violence because it's accepted they couldn't have possibly
*19:54.360- 19:59.100* :  have known that Anzerov was going to kill Samuel Patti. Nonetheless, they are charged with
*19:59.300- 20:05.760* :  helping the killer or route, and for not thinking about their actions. And they stand to serve
*20:06.380- 20:10.400* :  some months in prison, though it may well be that they get off just with a very, very stern
*20:10.860- 20:17.100* :  conviction, but a stern warning. Hughes Goveholder in Paris. Almost 10 years after Malaysia Airlines
*20:17.100- 20:23.460* :  flight MH370 disappeared on route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board,
*20:23.920- 20:27.540* :  a court in the Chinese capital has begun to hear compensation claims.
*20:28.360- 20:31.900* :  The plane is presumed to have plunged into the southern ocean south of India.
*20:32.540- 20:37.200* :  After the largest search in aviation history, only a few pieces of debris were ever located.
*20:37.940- 20:41.700* :  Families of the mainly Chinese victims gathered outside the court,
*20:42.140- 20:44.220* :  Zhang Hui's mother, was one of those on the flight.
*20:47.100- 20:52.840* :  After 10 years, the court has finally opened the hearing. To us, it's a turning point,
*20:53.640- 20:59.920* :  but the survival of the relatives during these years, the deterioration of their living conditions
*20:59.980- 21:05.660* :  with many relatives having left us because they didn't have money to treat illnesses,
*21:05.660- 21:12.100* :  this makes us very sad. So I hope that the legal relief can be realized as soon as possible.
*21:12.660- 21:17.480* :  It's not difficult. Our China correspondent Laura Bickert told me more about the case.
*21:18.120- 21:22.900* :  As you heard there, I think the hope is that more than 40 families who've the filed
*21:22.900- 21:26.740* :  lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines, the aircraft manufacturer Boeing,
*21:26.740- 21:32.960* :  engine maker Rose Royce and the Lions Insurance Group, they're looking for some kind of closure
*21:33.480- 21:38.340* :  and the hope is that they get some compensation for, as you heard there, a disaster that
*21:38.340- 21:42.320* :  deprived them of their loved ones and placed them in financial difficulty.
*21:42.320- 21:47.100* :  Now, this disaster resonated through Beijing just after the disappearance of the flight.
*21:47.100- 21:51.680* :  There were daily briefings. There were daily visuals. Some relatives refused to believe
*21:51.680- 21:56.280* :  the plane had disappeared, believing that it had been taken to an unknown site. Others thought
*21:56.280- 22:01.720* :  their relatives remained alive and refused to accept compassionate payments from the airline.
*22:02.220- 22:07.940* :  Now, even if the court rolls in their favour, it's not really clear what financial obligations each
*22:07.940- 22:12.740* :  of these organisations, whether it be Malaysia Airlines, Boeing, Rose Royce or Alliance,
*22:12.740- 22:17.320* :  may have. And so far, no charges have been brought against the flight crew.
*22:17.780- 22:23.140* :  So the family's litigation requests focuses on this compensation, but also about trying to find
*22:23.140- 22:28.740* :  the truth behind this flight's disappearance. The case appears to be based on the contention
*22:28.740- 22:34.400* :  of the airline failed to take measures to locate the plane. After it disappeared from air traffic
*22:34.540- 22:40.420* :  control, about 38 minutes after takeoff over the South China Sea on that night, March 8, 2014.
*22:41.000- 22:44.640* :  And as the Chinese Government got any view on this case?
*22:45.120- 22:50.200* :  Well, China says it values the follow-up to the incident of MH378 and Malaysia Airlines flights
*22:50.200- 22:55.180* :  the wind missing, and hopes all sides maintain close communication and properly handle this issue.
*22:55.180- 23:00.040* :  That was from the foreign ministry earlier today from spokesperson Wang Wen-Bing. He made the
*23:00.040- 23:05.480* :  reports. It made the comments after media reports of the court holding these first hearings
*23:05.480- 23:11.280* :  of the lawsuit and became public. Malaysia's transport minister and Malaysian airlines
*23:11.280- 23:16.840* :  have both declined to comment on the hearings so far. And there has been some criticism that
*23:16.840- 23:21.660* :  this court hearing has been shrouded in secrecy, but as you heard there, families have been
*23:21.660- 23:24.180* :  managing to speak to reporters as they head into the hearings.
*23:24.800- 23:27.240* :  Our China correspondent Laura Bicke in Beijing.
*23:28.280- 23:31.680* :  Now it's been described as a huge win for the tobacco industry.
*23:31.680- 23:36.200* :  The new right of center government in New Zealand has announced it will scrap plans for
*23:36.200- 23:41.540* :  anti-smoking laws due to have come in later this year. The move was confirmed by the new Prime
*23:41.540- 23:46.420* :  Minister, Christopher Luxon, after he was sworn in and is part of a wider rollback of the
*23:46.420- 23:50.000* :  previous government's policies. I heard more from Phil Mercer in Sydney.
*23:50.400- 23:56.460* :  These are laws introduced into New Zealand last year and they would have banned cigarette
*23:56.460- 24:06.920* :  sales next year to anyone born after 2008. And this was an attempt to ban smoking for future generations
*24:06.920- 24:14.600* :  at the time medical practitioners and anti tobacco campaigners said that the measures would save
*24:14.600- 24:20.520* :  thousands of lives. And what we're seeing now, one of the first acts of the new
*24:20.520- 24:27.920* :  center right coalition government in New Zealand is to scrap the legislation to fund tax cuts
*24:28.300- 24:35.960* :  that were part of its election campaign. So a lot of controversy on day one of the new government
*24:35.960- 24:41.440* :  in New Zealand. Yeah, tell us what else they're planning. They want to roll back the use of the
*24:41.440- 24:47.100* :  Māori language and end a ban on oil and gas exploration. That's right. The government under
*24:47.100- 24:54.240* :  the new Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says there will be a reappraisal of measures to boost the
*24:54.240- 25:02.000* :  Māori language in New Zealand and also a repeal of a ban on offshore oil and gas exploration.
*25:02.640- 25:08.800* :  And there will be many people in New Zealand who are now getting used to the idea that to new
*25:08.800- 25:16.520* :  government means a whole load of new reforms given that Labour under the former Prime Minister Jacinda
*25:16.520- 25:23.300* :  Ardern was in power for six years. And now we have a conservative coalition administration
*25:23.300- 25:29.220* :  that seems likely to take a bit of an axe to the policies of the former administration.
*25:29.680- 25:34.640* :  Yeah, it's quite a turnaround. Jacinda Ardern was quite popular around the world, perhaps less so
*25:34.640- 25:40.140* :  among some in New Zealand, but overall the country seems to have shifted to the right.
*25:40.140- 25:47.020* :  Jacinda Ardern quit earlier this year. She was replaced by a man called Chris Hippkins who led
*25:47.020- 25:55.240* :  the Labour Party into the election in the middle of October. There was a crushing defeat for Labour.
*25:55.240- 26:03.300* :  And it has resulted in six weeks of negotiations between the Conservative National Party and two
*26:03.300- 26:10.780* :  smaller minor parties. And what we have now is a coalition of the National Party and also the
*26:10.780- 26:18.820* :  Libertarian Act New Zealand Party and the populist New Zealand First Party. And it's the New Zealand
*26:18.820- 26:26.580* :  first part of the coalition that was very keen, for example, to repeal these tough anti-tobacco
*26:26.580- 26:33.820* :  measures. And it could well be for many New Zealanders a taste of what's to come. The unwinding
*26:33.820- 26:40.780* :  of various reforms introduced by the Ardern government. And for many New Zealanders, they wanted
*26:40.780- 26:47.800* :  a change and changed. They most certainly have going from six years of a left-of-center Labour
*26:47.800- 26:53.300* :  government to at least three more years of a centre-right coalition.
*26:53.780- 27:00.080* :  Phil Maser in Sydney. Returning now to the conflict in the Middle East, and ever since the Hamas
*27:00.080- 27:05.960* :  atrocities of the 7th of October and the Israeli assault on Gaza, there has been a dramatic rise
*27:05.960- 27:12.340* :  in divisive rhetoric and misinformation online. But with lives being lost in the real world,
*27:12.340- 27:17.460* :  should we care what's happening on sites like TikTok and X, formerly Twitter? That's the
*27:17.460- 27:23.460* :  question being asked in the first episode of The Global Story, a new BBC podcast launching today.
*27:24.760- 27:30.100* :  This war isn't only being fought on the ground, there's a battle online to control the narrative,
*27:30.100- 27:36.760* :  to influence opinions on losses and suffering, rights and wrongs, facts and fake news.
*27:38.820- 27:42.760* :  So we're asking, who is winning the social media war?
*27:44.780- 27:49.940* :  And asking the question, Global Story presenter Katya Adler, who joined me to tell us more about
*27:49.940- 27:57.760* :  the social media war. I think a lot is being made in the Israel-Hamas war as at the time when Russia
*27:58.180- 28:03.580* :  launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine that we are going back to a time of conventional warfare.
*28:03.740- 28:07.320* :  If you like, and that's shocking for a lot of countries that said, you know, those days were in the
*28:07.320- 28:13.560* :  past. But at the same time as going back, we are going forward and all of these wars. And if you
*28:13.560- 28:20.020* :  remember, in Syria as well, at the time, it was being fought out, played out on social media.
*28:20.020- 28:26.820* :  We ignore that at our peril. And also, you can't tell the whole story without looking at social media.
*28:26.820- 28:33.720* :  When it comes to Israel-Gaza right now, obviously for a global audience, the images that are across
*28:33.720- 28:41.100* :  social media of the terrible civilian suffering in Gaza. And also, of course, the massacre that was
*28:41.100- 28:47.320* :  orchestrated by Hamas inside Israel, the taking of, you know, more than 200 hostages into the Gaza
*28:47.320- 28:53.580* :  strip, including very, very small children. It's very emotive. And that really plays out and resonates
*28:53.580- 28:59.620* :  on social media. So on the one hand, I think you've got this ability to inform, and that's what we
*28:59.620- 29:05.180* :  talk about. It can engage a much wider audience and get them involved in global issues, and perhaps
*29:05.180- 29:11.000* :  put pressure on governments to solve global issues. The negative side of it is it can be so emotive
*29:11.320- 29:17.220* :  that it can divide and send people even further into their echo chambers. So, you know, it's multi-layered,
*29:17.220- 29:21.480* :  and that's what we like on the global story. Our multi-layers, and we try and peel back those
*29:21.620- 29:27.960* :  layers for you. Yeah, and it's quite interesting that younger people were getting their views from
*29:27.960- 29:34.640* :  TikTok, and they tend to be more what pro-Palestinian, whereas on X Twitter, as it was, they're more
*29:34.640- 29:40.880* :  pro-Israeli. I mean, I think this is a snapshot that we see on our programme. As to where it is now,
*29:40.880- 29:47.080* :  you know, we talk to the BBC's disinformation expert. And that's what we do on the global story,
*29:47.080- 29:53.160* :  is we really tap into all of those experts that we have at the BBC. And because we have a bit more
*29:53.160- 29:59.060* :  time, we look at one global story at a time, every day, Monday to Friday, it enables those experts
*29:59.060- 30:04.360* :  to really showcase their knowledge, to really help us get under the skin of a story. And also,
*30:04.360- 30:09.660* :  what we want to do is send our listeners away with, oh, I hadn't thought of it that way. And that way,
*30:09.660- 30:14.360* :  we continue the conversation, because hopefully our listeners then have dinner with their family,
*30:14.360- 30:19.900* :  or going to work the next day, going, oh, did you know this? And we continue that to global conversation.
*30:20.160- 30:23.380* :  So episode one in the can, do you know what you're going to do for the rest of the week?
*30:23.480- 30:29.260* :  We're going to do so much stuff. You have to tune in to find out. But we aim to cover a really
*30:29.260- 30:33.300* :  broad range of stories. So we're obviously going to look at the environment, because you've got,
*30:33.300- 30:39.460* :  you know, the COP summit coming up. We have a look at Biden's brain, so Joe Biden, aging US
*30:39.460- 30:44.940* :  president, who's standing for re-election, should he? What can we expect of 81-82-year-old?
*30:45.200- 30:50.400* :  How come he gets away with it? And the man who we presume will be his rival for president in
*30:50.400- 30:55.020* :  the US next year, Donald Trump, only four years younger. But he seems to escape a lot of that
*30:55.020- 31:00.880* :  kind of ageous criticism. Very importantly, we have some tips for all of us then about how to keep
*31:00.880- 31:07.100* :  all of our brains younger. So that's one of the other episodes. So we do really try to cover a
*31:07.100- 31:14.600* :  whole range, and we're appropriate, some humor. Katya Adler, and you can find global story wherever
*31:14.600- 31:22.080* :  you get your BBC podcasts. And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be
*31:22.080- 31:27.900* :  back very soon. This edition was produced by Peter Goffin, and mixed by Vladimir Morzeczka,
