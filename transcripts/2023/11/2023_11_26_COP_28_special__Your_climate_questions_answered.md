*01:22.720- 01:30.840* :  I'm Nick Miles in London and in this edition recorded at 14 hours GMT on Friday the 24th of November,
*01:30.840- 01:37.040* :  ahead of the COP28 climate meeting in Dubai. We're joined by Greia Jackson, who's not just a
*01:37.040- 01:43.420* :  scientist, but also the presenter of the climate question. Hi there. Hello and by the BBC's Climate
*01:43.420- 01:49.540* :  Editor Justin Romance. Thanks to you both. We will be putting your questions to them about everything
*01:49.540- 01:54.800* :  from new technology to tree planting and what can be done by us, the sort of people who don't
*01:54.800- 02:00.760* :  get invited to big international conferences like the one in Dubai. There is a lot to get through,
*02:00.760- 02:03.100* :  so without further ado, let's get started.
*02:06.420- 02:11.940* :  The fire is on front street and it is time to go. The boats in the harbor, most of them were burned
*02:11.940- 02:16.980* :  and had sunk. The historic section behind the town, which is to be the capital of Hawaii,
*02:17.160- 02:22.420* :  was burned to the ground, historic buildings, the church. There are plenty of houses,
*02:22.940- 02:29.780* :  plenty of houses, but you're all poor. These are some of the rocks that destroyed people's houses
*02:29.780- 02:36.040* :  here in three ways in Blanter when Saikson Freddie made landfall in Malawi. Some of these rocks
*02:36.040- 02:45.700* :  are four times my size and when I was going up so she killed me. This is what it looks like here in
*02:45.700- 02:52.320* :  Derna at the moment. The buildings, the cars were swept out to sea and all that's left
*02:52.320- 03:01.000* :  is rubble and dirt and destruction. Some of this year's news coverage of fires in Hawaii,
*03:01.000- 03:06.540* :  the devastation in Southeast Africa caused by Saikson Freddie and the destruction in Libya
*03:07.000- 03:12.180* :  from Storm Daniel. Data suggests this is very likely to be the hottest year on record.
*03:13.060- 03:17.820* :  It is against this background that world leaders are gathering in the United Arab Emirates for
*03:17.840- 03:24.500* :  COP28. That's the UN Climate Change Conference. The 28th such meeting to promote coordinated
*03:24.500- 03:29.980* :  action to tackle climate change. First up, Justin, our climate editor in a nutshell,
*03:30.360- 03:34.440* :  what are the delegates and organizers hoping will come out of COP this year?
*03:34.660- 03:43.200* :  70,000 people going, 167 world leaders, the Pope, the King, there's a huge amount that they cover
*03:43.580- 03:49.140* :  and they're saying this is going to be a really crucial COP. To be fair, they always say this,
*03:49.140- 03:53.060* :  don't they? They always say it's crucial. But there is a very important moment. This is the moment
*03:53.060- 03:58.760* :  we do the global stock take. The first global stock take since Paris and Paris back in 2015 was
*03:58.760- 04:03.800* :  really significant because listeners may find this bizarre. That was the first time
*04:03.800- 04:07.900* :  that all the countries in the world agreed that they'd get together and would tackle it. Before that,
*04:07.920- 04:12.140* :  it was only developed countries that were going to tackle climate change. That was a watershed
*04:12.140- 04:17.860* :  moment for climate. This is the first time we assess how effective the action that countries,
*04:17.860- 04:22.420* :  all the countries in the world, have been in doing the things that they said they were going to do
*04:22.420- 04:26.740* :  to try and tackle climate change because the agreement is that they decide. They do nationally
*04:26.740- 04:31.520* :  determined contributions. That's them deciding what they're going to do on climate change. So we're
*04:31.520- 04:35.600* :  going to be looking at the synthesis, bringing that together, saying how well we're doing and we're
*04:35.600- 04:39.320* :  not doing very well. We know that because they published that earlier on. We know that we're way
*04:39.320- 04:45.100* :  behind where we should be and the other thing on the agenda is to change the way those nationally
*04:45.100- 04:49.340* :  determined contributions, those commitments that people make about how to cut emissions and take
*04:49.340- 04:53.980* :  action on climate generally, how those are defined to try and ratchet up ambition because the
*04:53.980- 05:00.480* :  idea at Paris was that you gradually raise ambition over time and so this is the moment where we
*05:00.480- 05:05.940* :  begin to see and almost certainly some of those we pushed into into next year. The deadline for
*05:05.940- 05:12.080* :  this is 2025 and the it's Brazil is hosting COP 30 in 2025 and that's when they're going to have
*05:12.080- 05:17.320* :  to come up with these new commitments to tackling climate change. So plenty to discuss, plenty to
*05:17.320- 05:21.260* :  get us just the beginning. That's going to say there's quite a lot more. I think people are looking
*05:21.740- 05:27.540* :  up. I'm plenty of questions as well. Let's hear from some listeners. It's fair to say there is some
*05:27.540- 05:35.600* :  skepticism about these in-person meetings like COP 28. I am Satyana from India. The climate
*05:35.600- 05:41.080* :  conference being held in Dubai is unlikely to solve any problems. The jet flights which carry
*05:41.080- 05:47.260* :  these politicians travel long distances, they consume millions of gallons of oil and they release a
*05:47.260- 05:52.920* :  tons of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into the air. Instead of traveling such a long distances,
*05:53.020- 05:58.560* :  these world leaders should stay home and they can discuss climate problems using various
*05:59.120- 06:05.520* :  online media platforms. Hello there. This is John Langridge from Spain. I think the fact that there is
*06:05.520- 06:12.520* :  going to be yet another in-person climate summit is frankly an offensive outrage. How many private
*06:12.520- 06:18.560* :  jets or first-class travel will there be? How many guided tours? How many luxury hotels will
*06:18.560- 06:23.700* :  be occupied? How much greenwashing of the host nation will there be? The whole thing should be done
*06:23.700- 06:30.640* :  over Zoom. So Justin, let's look at this one. The value of this in-person meeting. Better example,
*06:30.640- 06:34.900* :  not to fly, I suppose, but can you get as much done? Well, let's look at it in another way because
*06:34.900- 06:38.680* :  there's a lot of criticism of these COP conferences and people say well nothing ever comes out of it.
*06:39.020- 06:42.940* :  And I think we should take a really broad perspective on this, right? You're an alien looking
*06:42.940- 06:47.080* :  down on the earth and thinking about the nature of the problem that people are trying to tackle.
*06:47.460- 06:52.580* :  So everyone, all of us are responsible in our tiny way for the problem because one way or another,
*06:53.040- 06:58.220* :  everything we do involves burning fossil fuels. So we need to get the world together to talk about
*06:58.220- 07:02.980* :  how to do this and just so happens that our world is divided up into nation states, which I mean,
*07:02.980- 07:07.460* :  they determine what happens within their boundaries, but they kind of, they sit above their countries.
*07:07.680- 07:11.780* :  And so the first thing your aliens are going to say is like, guys, you need to talk about this,
*07:11.780- 07:17.380* :  right? You need to get together. And this is actually the biggest meeting of world leaders on
*07:17.380- 07:22.180* :  the planet every year, far bigger than, for example, the UN General Assembly. This is when world
*07:22.180- 07:27.340* :  leaders get together. It's the unique thing and it's an extraordinary thing, right? You know, Russia
*07:27.340- 07:31.180* :  is going. There will be representatives from Ukraine. There's a Palestinian representative.
*07:31.500- 07:35.840* :  There are representatives from Israel. War in countries will be sitting together, talking about
*07:35.840- 07:40.800* :  how to solve this problem. That is, frankly, a miracle, right? And we should acknowledge that
*07:40.800- 07:45.260* :  and recognize this is a really important meeting. Point two, so it's really important. Number one,
*07:45.380- 07:51.240* :  point two, do you get more done in person? The example of this is COVID, right? The UN decided not
*07:51.240- 07:56.120* :  to have a meeting during COVID. We all zoomed, happened by then and we knew that there were alternatives
*07:56.120- 08:01.220* :  to it. So I remember saying to the UN, why Earth, that you just have it on zoom? Why are you delaying?
*08:01.220- 08:05.700* :  Because that's the year last of climate action that's lost. And they said, listen, you know,
*08:05.700- 08:09.660* :  we do conferences all the time. That's basically what the UN does is get people together to talk about
*08:09.660- 08:14.300* :  stuff. They say, we just know that you get more effective action if you've got people sitting
*08:14.300- 08:18.140* :  face to face with each other. And frankly, the scale of the problem we're facing and the
*08:18.380- 08:23.360* :  minute emissions caused by this relatively speaking, because remember we're talking about solving
*08:23.360- 08:28.540* :  this massive global problem. This is a drop in the ocean and this is one of the few opportunities
*08:28.540- 08:33.180* :  the world has to really do something to turn the dial on this. And there's the serendipity,
*08:33.180- 08:37.420* :  isn't it? It's bumping into people on the sidelines, Greia. Yeah, absolutely. You know, you
*08:37.420- 08:40.940* :  think about it in the office is talking to someone at the water cooler. You know, there's these
*08:41.400- 08:46.780* :  informal interactions that are really important in building relationships. And ultimately, if you
*08:46.780- 08:51.240* :  have good relationships with people, you're more inclined to get a better climate deal out of it
*08:51.240- 08:56.980* :  at the end of it. We're from our second listener asking about greenwashing of the host nation
*08:56.980- 09:02.460* :  Dubai or alleged greenwashing. A point also picked up by Catherine, a listener from Boston in the
*09:02.460- 09:08.100* :  USA. She says, how can world leaders effectively work to reduce global emissions at COP 28
*09:08.100- 09:13.380* :  with Sultan Ahmed al-Jaba, the head of one of the world's biggest oil companies,
*09:13.380- 09:19.620* :  leading the negotiations? How will leaders and delegates ensure that al-Jaba and the UAE
*09:19.620- 09:24.540* :  do not act in the interests of oil? Justin, well, I should declare an interest here because I'm
*09:24.540- 09:30.040* :  working on a story that speaks to this and is evidence of, in a sense, bad faith on this issue by
*09:30.040- 09:36.420* :  the UAE and by Dr. Sultan. But let me put their defense. I mean, people will see my story as it
*09:36.420- 09:41.420* :  comes out. Let me put their defense and they say, listen, yeah, we're an oil producer, but unless you
*09:41.420- 09:45.440* :  draw us into the discussion and that's where part of the discussion, yeah, we're part of the problem,
*09:45.440- 09:50.200* :  but sorry, you, you use our oil. And we all need to talk about how to solve this. And I do think
*09:50.200- 09:55.600* :  there is force and validity in that argument. Yeah, the other argument I've heard from Dr.
*09:55.600- 10:02.160* :  al-Jaba is that because he is from oil, from big oil, he runs ad-knock the national oil company,
*10:02.860- 10:08.100* :  precisely because of that, he has that background, he knows the industry, he can make oil producers
*10:08.100- 10:13.220* :  sit up and listen in a way that they haven't done in past cops. I remember Poland was criticised in
*10:13.220- 10:18.260* :  the past, wasn't a big coal producer. Well, hold on, hold on, the UK, you know, we're doing the last
*10:18.260- 10:24.360* :  gasp of oil and gasp of oil. Absolutely, Egypt, which hosted it, so we were two cops ago, Egypt,
*10:24.360- 10:30.000* :  the last cop has huge natural gas resources. Very few people can afford to cast stones at others,
*10:30.000- 10:34.600* :  can they? I think the proof is in the pudding, you know, sometimes cops look not all that promising
*10:34.600- 10:37.960* :  when you're going into them. And there's something about the alchemy of bringing all these
*10:37.960- 10:42.940* :  different people together from all walks of life that can create something that nobody expects.
*10:42.940- 10:46.620* :  So I think you have to just wait and see you can't prejudge these things. So on this one,
*10:46.620- 10:51.440* :  you're doing the positive bit. And I'm going to do something a little bit negative on the UAE,
*10:51.740- 10:56.860* :  which is that, you know, I was at the pre-cop meeting in Abu Dhabi where he did his kind of introduction
*10:56.940- 11:01.860* :  and his ambitions in front of I think the 96 environment ministers from around the world. And he
*11:01.860- 11:06.580* :  said, look, we need the what with the target we need to achieve is a 43% in cut in greenhouse
*11:06.580- 11:14.160* :  emissions by 2030, which is what the UN's climate body, the IPCC says needs to happen. At the same
*11:14.160- 11:20.460* :  time though, the UAE has published or adnot the UAE's state oil company, which Mr Al-Jabar
*11:20.820- 11:26.140* :  is in charge of. He's the CEO. They published their plans for increasing capacity and they want
*11:26.140- 11:32.300* :  to increase capacity by 2030 by 600,000 barrels of oil. They produce about 2 million at the moment.
*11:32.380- 11:36.780* :  So they're increasing by about a third at a time when he's publicly saying the target for this
*11:36.780- 11:41.860* :  conference should be a reduction of 43%. And I mean, at the very least, I'll say I think there is
*11:41.860- 11:49.380* :  a little whiff of hypocrisy about that. Controverses all all around here. Let's move on to a couple
*11:49.380- 11:56.580* :  of other questions from two school students in Indonesia. Hello, my name is Emily. As someone who
*11:56.580- 12:02.980* :  lives in Indonesia, the temperature in this country received a dramatic increase. The sun's ultraviolet,
*12:02.980- 12:09.980* :  UV rays cause damage to people's skins, eyes and even their immune system. How has the temperature
*12:09.980- 12:15.340* :  increased so much and what is the best way to stop this? Hi, my name is Shaina. My question is,
*12:15.340- 12:20.500* :  in the face of unpredictable climate challenges, are global leaders' collaborations adequate or are
*12:20.500- 12:26.400* :  stronger measures required and commitments needed for effective change? Graham, Emily's question
*12:26.400- 12:31.040* :  first, it really gets to the heart of it, doesn't it? How has the temperature increased so much
*12:31.540- 12:36.500* :  and what's the best way to deal with it? Primarily, it's been by burning fossil fuels to create energy,
*12:36.500- 12:42.960* :  so that's coal, oil and gas. And when we burn those, those three fuels, we essentially create
*12:42.960- 12:48.620* :  carbon dioxide, a key planet warming gas. And that acts like a big blanket around the earth that
*12:48.620- 12:53.920* :  traps the heat in, and that's what's causing our planet to warm. There are other reasons why we get
*12:53.920- 12:58.440* :  planet warming gases into the sky, cutting down forests, which act as the drawdown of carbon
*12:58.440- 13:03.620* :  dioxide, producing food. But energy really is the key one. It's something like two thirds, three
*13:03.620- 13:10.120* :  quarters of our emissions. So the solution is to switch to low carbon and renewable energy sources,
*13:10.120- 13:16.100* :  so that's harnessing the wind, solar power, the waves, the tides, you know, anything that the
*13:16.100- 13:21.000* :  earth is producing, we harness it. And Justin, let's look at Shaina's question now. She asked about
*13:21.000- 13:26.460* :  stronger measures and commitments. I don't know, based on previous cops, can we take their
*13:26.460- 13:31.400* :  commitments seriously? We talked about the Synthesis report, which looks at people's actions and shows
*13:31.400- 13:36.600* :  how far behind we are. So I think there is a real question about whether countries are, you know,
*13:36.600- 13:41.260* :  really doubling down and taking the action they need to. But I'm really reluctant, as you
*13:41.260- 13:45.360* :  have gathered, to say that these conferences don't deliver outcomes. And there are things, for
*13:45.360- 13:49.120* :  example, that we're going to see at this cop, which are positive. So there was a commitment,
*13:49.120- 13:53.340* :  one of the key things is going to be finance, right? So how do you create the finance needed,
*13:53.340- 13:57.660* :  mostly for the developing world to afford the technologies, which now exist, which is,
*13:57.660- 14:02.040* :  frankly, a miracle and is an amazingly good news. We've got renewable technologies, wind and
*14:02.040- 14:06.360* :  solar that are now cheaper than fossil fuels. And therefore, there's really powerful
*14:06.360- 14:10.760* :  economic arguments, but there's a lot of cash upfront needed. Developing countries often pay very
*14:10.760- 14:15.180* :  high interest rates much higher than in developed countries for historical reasons. They perhaps
*14:15.180- 14:19.740* :  haven't paid their debts as much, but it means it's way more expensive for them to invest in renewables.
*14:20.020- 14:24.440* :  And there are some really interesting efforts to look at ways that you can reduce the cost of
*14:24.440- 14:29.440* :  renewables, which involve the multinational development banks. So the World Bank and the IMF,
*14:29.440- 14:33.220* :  are the key examples of that. And there's an effort to change the way they've done lead. And we've
*14:33.460- 14:37.880* :  done it on the climate question with a wonderful mere motley, who's the president of Barbados,
*14:38.260- 14:43.120* :  a country with 200,000 people, which is less than one single London borough. They're like a,
*14:43.400- 14:47.460* :  the little kind of boroughs that London's divided, smaller population who led this argument,
*14:47.460- 14:51.460* :  which frankly, she's won the argument, and they want to do this and change it. That will be a huge
*14:51.460- 14:56.320* :  debate caught. There was a commitment made way back in, I think, 2017 that we'd come up with
*14:56.320- 15:01.620* :  $100 billion a year to give to developing countries for climate adaptation, climate mitigation,
*15:01.620- 15:06.120* :  you know, putting in, cutting their emissions. That will almost certainly be delivered, you know.
*15:06.120- 15:09.300* :  It has been delivered. Well, they say, you know, but it hasn't actually been certified.
*15:09.300- 15:13.040* :  But so there are really positive things coming out of it. There was a loss and damage fund.
*15:13.040- 15:18.240* :  That was a big debate at Charmau Shaken Egypt last year. Well, it was agreed. And they've
*15:18.240- 15:22.800* :  now agreed. There's a big question about whether anyone's going to put significant money into that.
*15:23.120- 15:27.560* :  But look, there are other things that are going to happen that probably will begin to have an effect.
*15:27.740- 15:31.680* :  Yeah. And I'm kind of interested to see what side deals are going to come out of this.
*15:31.680- 15:36.360* :  You're obviously side deals. They're really interesting and they don't get as much coverage.
*15:36.500- 15:40.380* :  But COP is a place where people come together and make these side deals. So, for instance,
*15:40.380- 15:45.920* :  the PAC to Wendy for a station by 2030 or the just energy transition partnerships where richer
*15:45.920- 15:51.060* :  countries are paying developing countries like South Africa to transition away from coal.
*15:51.360- 15:53.540* :  So these are really exciting things that going on.
*15:53.840- 15:58.800* :  Great. You just mentioned the issue of deforestation. This list is concerned about one of the other
*15:58.800- 16:04.880* :  big topics discussed at COP summit all the time. How to protect and renew the world's forests
*16:04.880- 16:11.160* :  to try to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is Ralph Rooney in Alameda, California.
*16:11.160- 16:17.980* :  Efforts to plant millions, even billions of trees to combat climate change or a form of
*16:17.980- 16:24.420* :  greenwashing. Those such efforts will make participants feel good and can burnish the image
*16:24.420- 16:32.520* :  of politicians. Why are we not honest with ourselves? Trees usually take 20 to 30 years to reach full
*16:32.520- 16:39.800* :  maturity. A sapling is not expected to absorb the same amount of carbon dioxide as would a full
*16:39.800- 16:46.460* :  grown tree. You also cannot plant and forget. Some organisations must tend to these trees
*16:46.620- 16:54.800* :  to create a monocultural forest which also has less biodiversity. So, Greia, does Ralph have a point?
*16:55.660- 16:59.840* :  There are also issues with I think what he's describing is offsetting, right? And this is the idea
*16:59.840- 17:04.520* :  that you you buy a load of credits if you like. You pay for some trees to be planted somewhere,
*17:04.860- 17:08.960* :  and that somehow offsets your lifestyle or your company or your business, right?
*17:09.340- 17:13.600* :  And there are issues surrounding offsets that have been lots of investigations into them,
*17:13.760- 17:18.540* :  and some of them suggest that exactly the things that the listener Ralph is pointing out that
*17:18.540- 17:22.420* :  sometimes these trees are planted, they're never looked at again and they die, so they don't
*17:22.420- 17:27.500* :  risk, you know, get their full carbon potential, so to speak. But also, they might catch fire.
*17:27.780- 17:32.440* :  And you release all that carbon back into the atmosphere. And some offset schemes actually logging
*17:32.440- 17:37.680* :  is accounted for, so these trees might eventually be logged in the end. But I think the key thing
*17:37.680- 17:42.440* :  here is there's not enough land to plant the trees for the amount of carbon we emit. So,
*17:42.660- 17:46.860* :  it doesn't get around the fact that we need to reduce our emissions, right? That said,
*17:46.860- 17:51.520* :  trees are great, they're great for the climate, they draw down carbon, they're great for people,
*17:51.520- 17:55.460* :  they're great for wildlife, they're great for biodiversity. So, I'm not saying don't plant trees,
*17:55.460- 17:58.980* :  but they're just not panseer that everyone thinks they are. I'll make exactly the same point,
*17:58.980- 18:03.380* :  don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and like it may not, some of them may not work,
*18:04.120- 18:09.020* :  some of them may help. There's a big question about trees die, and at that point, they rot and
*18:09.020- 18:12.960* :  they release their carbon dioxide. So, there has to be a kind of end-of-life plan to store the
*18:12.960- 18:17.260* :  carbon embodied in them. And the other thing that I think the critics of carbon offsetting miss
*18:17.260- 18:24.460* :  is this is a really good way to draw finance into the whole process. So, you can get money to do
*18:24.460- 18:28.540* :  stuff that might be hard to do, particularly in developing countries, might not always be perfect,
*18:28.540- 18:34.200* :  and we journalists do tend to focus on the sometimes rare imperfections in these things. I'm not
*18:34.200- 18:37.660* :  saying that's the case in all of certainty. I think quite a lot of it has questions about it,
*18:37.900- 18:42.300* :  but look, it's a way of drawing money into things that otherwise, I mean, if it's working,
*18:42.300- 18:45.640* :  wouldn't happen. It's mostly in developing countries, and that is a good thing.
*18:45.840- 18:50.140* :  Provide jobs for you to income for local people. What on resources to make the transition and
*18:50.140- 18:54.600* :  invest in renewable energy and all those other things as well. So, yeah, these are potentially
*19:00.580- 19:04.960* :  very positive. We've got another great question on this theme as well. This one from a listener
*19:05.320- 19:09.900* :  to the climate question. Hi there, I'm Chris Cummins, and I'm a climate journalist at the
*19:09.900- 19:15.000* :  Austrian Broadcasting Corporation's FM Thea in Vienna. I've just been on a trip to the Sahardo
*19:15.000- 19:20.300* :  in Brazil. That's a savanna forest area, so the trees are shorter and further apart than in
*19:20.300- 19:24.780* :  some forests, but they have an incredibly rich root system full of carbon, of course.
*19:25.160- 19:30.760* :  The Sahardo is being destroyed at an alarming rate. I've heard there's a move to broaden the
*19:30.760- 19:36.220* :  definition of a forest at COP28, or at least make protection better for, quote, non-forested areas
*19:36.220- 19:42.320* :  that are carbon sinks. The UN guidelines on forest protection are currently quite narrow, say,
*19:42.320- 19:47.580* :  conservationists. So, it made me wonder, in your opinion, when is a forest? A forest.
*19:48.380- 19:53.280* :  Turn into philosophy port, hasn't it? Greia, what do you reckon? Look, I mean, under current
*19:53.280- 19:58.300* :  definitions, what our listener is describing there is not a forest, right? But there are plenty of
*19:58.300- 20:03.020* :  other non-forest ecosystems, as he points out, that are really important for climate change. He
*20:03.020- 20:08.000* :  mentioned savannas, but there's also grasslands and peat bogs and mangroves. These are all really
*20:08.000- 20:12.160* :  important resources that don't necessarily involve trees, but it's still really important when
*20:12.160- 20:17.820* :  you're looking at this sort of the carbon cycle. And actually, I've read that grasslands can hold
*20:17.820- 20:21.520* :  something like two times more carbon than tropical forests, so they're not to be ignored.
*20:21.520- 20:24.580* :  Oh, I have a knowledge when they die. I mean, some of it is taken up by the soil.
*20:24.620- 20:27.100* :  In the soil, I was going to say, but that's especially the case with peat bogs.
*20:27.100- 20:28.420* :  But about sea grass, isn't it?
*20:28.420- 20:32.780* :  Sea grass as well. Even with peat bogs, right? I mean, so like some of the peat in the peat bogs
*20:32.780- 20:38.320* :  here in Britain is pre, the, you know, comes from the ice age, you know, it's been there for so long.
*20:38.320- 20:44.000* :  But there is a quite, yeah, 12,000 years, but there is a question about, you know, at some stage,
*20:44.000- 20:48.860* :  that will rot away. So it's a, it's a, you know, we have to be careful with these carbon stores that
*20:48.860- 20:52.700* :  they will one day release. But I think you're right. Essentially, kind of what little
*20:52.700- 20:57.960* :  strands of nature we have left in the world compared to what we were requested 100 years ago.
*20:58.360- 21:00.220* :  We need to look after everything we can't.
*21:00.360- 21:03.960* :  Yeah, and exactly, and I think this is the fear by a lot of campaigners who have actually written
*21:03.960- 21:09.880* :  a letter to COP28 saying that we need more focus on these non-forest system, because otherwise
*21:09.880- 21:12.660* :  we jeopardize how we fight climate change.
*21:12.660- 21:18.560* :  All these natural systems are important. They take global cooperation or certainly at a local
*21:18.560- 21:25.040* :  level anyway. What about other things that we as individuals have control over? What about,
*21:25.840- 21:28.520* :  what we eat, for example, let's listen to a question on that.
*21:29.280- 21:36.700* :  Hi, my name is Bridget Ringdoll. I am from Quasarunatel in South Africa, and my question to all
*21:36.700- 21:43.040* :  those meeting at the climate summit is when are food choices and the promotion of a plant-based
*21:43.040- 21:48.240* :  diet going to be on the agenda? It's the easiest thing to change. As nobody has to wait for
*21:48.240- 21:54.080* :  technology or politicians to make decisions, we can all start eating less animal products
*21:54.580- 21:59.040* :  now, today, apart from being a major contributor to the climate collapse,
*21:59.840- 22:04.520* :  animal agriculture is responsible for a huge biodiversity loss, the creation of dead zones in the
*22:04.520- 22:10.720* :  ocean, and a major use and polluter of fresh water. In my mind, it's a win-win for everybody and
*22:10.720- 22:14.800* :  everything. So, Grace, is this something that a delegate to COP will be talking about, you think?
*22:15.660- 22:20.460* :  I just want to come back to something she said in that I feel that you could argue this point for
*22:20.460- 22:26.020* :  most solutions that we have. We know how to solve the climate crisis, we know we need renewables,
*22:26.020- 22:31.900* :  we know we need less fossil fuels, we have all the technology and knowledge here, and the question
*22:31.900- 22:36.320* :  is how do we put that into place? And so, there are stumbling and blocks here along the way,
*22:36.680- 22:41.040* :  but with something like behavioural change, I do think that's quite hard to tackle because
*22:41.040- 22:46.620* :  remember the people that are making these policies are politicians, and those politicians have to
*22:46.620- 22:51.580* :  be voted in. So, they want to create popular policies. Telling a population they're not allowed
*22:51.580- 22:56.420* :  to eat certain foods is not likely to be a vote winner. So, I think it's quite difficult
*22:56.420- 23:02.940* :  politically to do. And the other thing I just want to cover, caveat is that this we need to eat
*23:02.940- 23:07.060* :  less meat applies very much to the Western world. There are huge ways of the world where actually
*23:07.060- 23:12.600* :  meat is a really important part of people's diets, malmourished, basically, is what I'm saying.
*23:12.660- 23:17.660* :  And so, this sort of advice doesn't really apply to a large population of the world. That's not
*23:18.340- 23:25.060* :  not the answer, Justin. But in many developed countries, there is already a process that's
*23:25.060- 23:29.640* :  happening without the intervention of politicians where people are beginning to eat less meat. And I
*23:29.640- 23:34.460* :  think any order, if somebody told me I couldn't eat meat, I probably would go out and eat meat
*23:34.460- 23:40.160* :  that very day, just sheer cussiness. I think we can't order people to do it, and we give people
*23:40.160- 23:46.580* :  examples of foods that are delicious, but hopefully cheaper, and equally healthy and more nutritious,
*23:46.620- 23:53.040* :  you know, that they can eat instead, and then they can occasionally have meat on a celebration,
*23:53.080- 23:57.160* :  for example. And that's a model that would work, don't we shouldn't think you have to be
*23:57.160- 24:01.980* :  plant-based? We can be omnivorous, but just eat a bit less meat. Yeah, and I think the other thing
*24:01.980- 24:05.880* :  I've heard that really sticks out to me is that there is a tipping point in sort of like the
*24:05.880- 24:11.020* :  population in terms of behaviour. So, apparently if 25% of the population start enacting this
*24:11.020- 24:15.540* :  behaviour, so in this case, eating a plant-based diet, it becomes normalized. And so much of the
*24:15.540- 24:19.740* :  rest of the population do it. And I think that's what you're describing. We're starting to see that
*24:19.740- 24:23.540* :  in areas of the world. But beginning to see the transition. And also, we, oh look, obviously it's
*24:23.540- 24:28.100* :  bad ever we do this quickly, because we want to cut emissions, but if we, you know, big changes
*24:28.100- 24:33.060* :  can happen, you know, with small individual changes, so it can make a big difference over time,
*24:33.060- 24:38.560* :  I guess is what I'm saying. Okay, so lifestyle choices will come slowly, perhaps, and then
*24:39.340- 24:44.000* :  rather more quickly, as it becomes socially far more normalized. Gradually and then suddenly.
*24:44.000- 24:48.920* :  Yeah, exactly. Listen, Justin, you mentioned a little bit earlier about clean energy sources as
*24:48.920- 24:54.600* :  one of the key themes of COP28. This listener is wondering about an alternative to fossil fuels.
*24:55.300- 25:00.540* :  My name is Heather and I'm from the state of Vermont in the US. With nuclear fusion now having been
*25:00.540- 25:05.700* :  achieved in the prospect of using it as a widespread source of infinite energy being projected
*25:05.700- 25:11.200* :  in the next 25 to 30 or so years, what updates and infrastructure will need to take place in
*25:11.200- 25:16.300* :  advance to prepare us for a quick and smooth conversion to energy derived from nuclear fusion?
*25:16.720- 25:20.720* :  Wow, there are so many of some butts in this one. Justin, it's been knocking around for decades.
*25:20.720- 25:26.140* :  Well, it's kind of always 30 years away. And look, yeah, the proof, they for the first time they've
*25:26.140- 25:31.280* :  had an experiment, which had an energy surplus on the energy put in not any of the embodied energy
*25:31.680- 25:36.860* :  in constructing the device, which was huge in the first place. Look, it seems to me that we
*25:36.860- 25:42.680* :  probably will be able to master nuclear fusion one day. I will be able to have long running reactions,
*25:42.680- 25:47.760* :  the reactions that take place within the reactor that generate a surplus of energy. But it's hard
*25:47.760- 25:52.580* :  to see given how difficult it is. We've been trying to do this for like 70 years. It's really,
*25:52.580- 25:57.080* :  really tricky. It's hard to see how it's ever. And this is a crucial word, going to be economic,
*25:57.080- 26:02.060* :  right? And at the moment, as we've already discussed, we've got, you know, box ready solutions,
*26:02.060- 26:07.540* :  solar and wind, for example, that we could start putting in place now that are already cheaper
*26:07.540- 26:12.480* :  than fossil fuels. So there's a really powerful economic argument for using them. It would be great
*26:12.480- 26:16.500* :  if we mastered fusion. But I think that's buckle down with the things we've got and start
*26:16.500- 26:20.340* :  putting making them work. I'm not saying don't invest in fusion. You know, I believe in technology,
*26:20.340- 26:24.260* :  I want the investments to be made. But let's not think that it's going to happen. I'm really sorry
*26:24.260- 26:27.480* :  in 25 years. It's probably not going to happen. No, I was going to say, I don't think it's, I think
*26:27.480- 26:32.020* :  most experts agree that it's not going to happen in time for what we need for net zero in terms
*26:32.020- 26:38.060* :  of 2050. Do the simple things now, which are getting better and more economically viable,
*26:38.740- 26:42.560* :  don't think about a pipe dream. And I think the other thing, right, is that we're going to need
*26:42.560- 26:47.360* :  lots of new technologies to be able to make this a reality. This is a totally different kind of
*26:47.360- 26:51.280* :  reaction than we see in conventional nuclear power plants. So we're going to need new plants.
*26:51.400- 26:55.360* :  The grid's going to have to be redesigned because it's going to have huge surges of power
*26:55.760- 27:00.560* :  and then very little. So there is some not only sort of some scientific things that we need to get
*27:00.560- 27:05.060* :  going. There are some technological and engineering things that we also need to solve before we can
*27:05.060- 27:09.960* :  even think about it powering our grids. They said we are nearly out of time. But just one last
*27:09.960- 27:17.760* :  question for both of you. Hello, my name is Nicola from London in the UK. My question is,
*27:18.580- 27:23.880* :  if everyone could do one thing to help that would have the most impact, what would it be?
*27:25.060- 27:28.840* :  Justin, you first. I mean, we look at this another way, right? It's like, what do you want to do?
*27:29.360- 27:32.420* :  Like, what do you want to do? I mean, I'm not saying I wouldn't advocate that everybody has a plant
*27:32.420- 27:36.860* :  based diet, for example. Eat less meat. But think what you're good at and what do you want to do
*27:36.860- 27:40.620* :  and then apply yourself to it. Because if you want to affect change, choose what you want to change
*27:40.620- 27:44.320* :  and then just get to work on it. And it could be something local. You know, you could be working
*27:44.320- 27:49.360* :  on a project to restore your part. That is doing your bit. You could be wanting to campaign or
*27:49.360- 27:53.260* :  something. That could be doing it. But you could want to advise around all sorts of things. Look
*27:53.260- 27:56.640* :  around and look at the levers that you can pull, what you're good at, what you're interested in
*27:56.680- 28:00.160* :  and then just go and do it. Yeah, because that's the most sustainable thing ultimately. You know,
*28:00.160- 28:05.340* :  thinking about your agency, what change can you affect. But if you're a bit stuck, you can go
*28:05.340- 28:09.840* :  online. There are lots of sort of personal carbon footprint trackers that you can look at your
*28:09.840- 28:14.240* :  carbon footprint roughly and see which areas that you can improve. And that might be a useful starting
*28:14.240- 28:18.700* :  point for someone here. You know, that's no idea what they want to do. Yeah, what can't just,
*28:18.720- 28:23.200* :  sorry, one last thought. Don't seek perfection. We're none of us going to be perfect.
*28:23.700- 28:27.800* :  Begin to do something is better than doing nothing. So don't do nothing because you know,
*28:27.800- 28:31.580* :  you want to fly on holiday, you can fly on holiday and do something. And then maybe in the future,
*28:31.580- 28:34.840* :  you'll think maybe I don't want to fly on holiday. But just start doing something now, I think,
*28:34.840- 28:38.120* :  is a really good injunction. I think we all worry that we're going to be criticized for not
*28:38.120- 28:41.680* :  being perfect and don't want to kind of put our heads above the parapet and start acting,
*28:41.680- 28:47.840* :  start acting at strong, strong, strong finish. All I was going to say was and don't underestimate
*28:47.840- 28:53.520* :  how important those, those steps are because other people see them and they start to do the same.
*28:53.520- 28:58.540* :  We talked about the ripple effect. It's really exciting. Yeah, it's about potential. It's not
*28:58.540- 29:03.500* :  about depriving yourself as, as you was saying, it's doing something that can be constructive and
*29:03.500- 29:11.260* :  positive yourself. Yeah, exactly. And that's all from this special edition of the Global News
*29:11.260- 29:16.360* :  Podcast, looking ahead to COP28. Our thanks to Justin Roller, the BBC's climate editor
