*00:51.680- 00:56.020* :  I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zingsing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*00:56.260- 01:00.080* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*01:00.080- 01:06.940* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*01:06.940- 01:12.280* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*01:12.280- 01:18.460* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner. But controversially turned against the players
*01:18.980- 01:22.980* :  when his sneakers were off. So is he Good Bad or just another billionaire?

*02:15.500- 02:23.940* :  Sudan is going from bad to worse. Also in this podcast, the secret of Taiwan's success
*02:23.940- 02:29.680* :  in producing advanced computer chips. We really could have best engineer and also operated
*02:29.680- 02:35.280* :  that actually hands on in the factory are also very, very high school.
*02:35.860- 02:41.140* :  But is it under threat? And that the two British actors whose love for one another over more than
*02:41.140- 02:50.680* :  six decades has defied even dimension. But first, Israeli military forces are continuing their
*02:50.680- 02:57.320* :  search of the al-Shifa hospital complex as we recall this podcast, which Israel says Hamas has
*02:57.320- 03:03.280* :  headquarters in tunnels beneath the hospital buildings. In the last few hours, the IDF has released
*03:03.280- 03:08.660* :  a video on social media, which it says shows some of the materials recovered from a building
*03:08.660- 03:14.300* :  in the al-Shifa hospital compound. The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage yet.
*03:15.020- 03:20.560* :  The raid has drawn widespread condemnation. But Mark Regeth, who's a senior advisor to the Israeli
*03:20.560- 03:25.000* :  Prime Minister, told the BBC that Israel had no choice but to go into the hospital.
*03:25.400- 03:29.840* :  We don't enter a hospital lightly. There has to be a serious reason for us to do so.
*03:30.260- 03:36.640* :  But the fact that Hamas has used the hospital as a shield for its military machine, I don't think
*03:36.640- 03:43.140* :  anyone serious doubts that today. Hamas has committed a war crime by turning the hospital into a
*03:43.140- 03:49.580* :  war zone. Israel's actions are a response to that. Nick Beak is our correspondent in Jerusalem.
*03:50.140- 03:54.040* :  So what exactly is Israel's military saying it's found inside the hospital?
*03:54.720- 04:00.640* :  The IDF have posted some videos, which they say was taken in the al-Shifa complex as part of
*04:00.640- 04:06.400* :  this military operation. And the videos show Israeli troops going through various wards and
*04:06.400- 04:11.980* :  at one point, one of the officers describes what he can see and the camera points to some,
*04:12.300- 04:19.760* :  what looked to be AK-47s, some magazines, some bulletproof vests, something that the Israeli soldier
*04:19.760- 04:25.060* :  says is a grab bag with different equipment that can be picked up and taken away. And then they
*04:25.060- 04:29.920* :  also released a statement, the Israeli Defence Forces, saying that they discovered an operational
*04:29.920- 04:35.720* :  command centre, weapons and technological assets. I think that probably means their laptops,
*04:35.720- 04:40.800* :  because they're shown in the computer as well. So this is what the Israelis have shown on the video,
*04:40.800- 04:46.340* :  but I think really worth stressing, the BBC isn't able to independently verify what we're seeing,
*04:46.340- 04:52.220* :  also worth stressing, Nick, that Israel has talked about this big underground command centre that
*04:52.220- 04:56.480* :  Hamas has built, which Hamas had denied. There's no sign of that at the moment from the video,
*04:56.480- 05:02.280* :  the Israelis have put out. The United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths has once more
*05:02.280- 05:06.240* :  appealed for an immediate ceasefire. It's here about what he had to say.
*05:06.640- 05:14.220* :  Silence the guns. Stop the fighting to allow the people to move safely. Do it for as long as possible.
*05:15.420- 05:23.380* :  Allow them to move safely on their own, not hindered and not pushed. And silence those guns long
*05:23.380- 05:29.860* :  enough to give the people of Gaza a breather from the terrible, terrible things that have been
*05:29.920- 05:36.460* :  put on this last few weeks. Nick, we saw the first tanker of fuel to get into Gaza since this
*05:36.460- 05:42.200* :  conflict started a month ago, come over from Egypt today. And Martin Griffiths has been talking
*05:42.200- 05:47.080* :  more about plans to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, isn't he? He has, yeah, he's talking about a
*05:47.080- 05:52.340* :  10 point plan and one of the most important elements of this, he says, is to open one specific
*05:52.340- 05:58.360* :  crossing, the Karem Shalom crossing, which was used to carry more than half, probably about 60%
*05:58.780- 06:04.740* :  of all the trucks going into Gaza before the recent violence erupted. He says this is really
*06:04.740- 06:09.040* :  important because the aid coming in through the Raffa crossing, which of course is in the south
*06:09.040- 06:14.760* :  on the Egyptian border. That originally was designed for pedestrian crossings, not trucks. He says
*06:14.760- 06:19.440* :  this will be really important. It will get more aid in. Another part of the plan is for lots of aid
*06:19.440- 06:24.680* :  agencies to be able to bring in more people so that they can set up relief hubs so they can
*06:24.680- 06:30.080* :  distribute aid to the people who need it. He also said they needed to be a lot more safe shelters
*06:30.080- 06:34.740* :  for all the people that have been displaced, not just in schools, but in other public places.
*06:35.120- 06:39.240* :  And he said this is what's needed to reign in the carnage and really give people a chance in
*06:39.240- 06:44.200* :  Gaza, people who've suffered so much. That was Nick Beak in Jerusalem. Well, the UN Security Council
*06:44.200- 06:50.340* :  has now passed a resolution calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses in the fighting
*06:50.340- 06:55.980* :  in Gaza. It says that those pauses could last for days to allow the delivery of aid.
*06:56.840- 07:01.940* :  As the war in Gaza rages on for the moment, it is thought that 239 Israelis and foreigners
*07:01.940- 07:07.640* :  remain held captive by Hamas there. Many of their families are now marching from what's known
*07:07.640- 07:12.620* :  as hostages square in Tel Aviv to the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem. They want the government
*07:12.620- 07:18.560* :  to do a deal now to bring home their loved ones. Our Middle East correspondent Yuland Nell reports
*07:18.560- 07:26.500* :  from Tel Aviv. The enduring trauma of the 7th of October. More than 240 people were forced into
*07:26.500- 07:33.520* :  Gaza at gunpoint from their homes, military bases and a large outdoor party. The fates of most
*07:33.520- 07:41.800* :  are unknown for their families. These are desperate times. She was taken by a motorcycle with two
*07:41.800- 07:48.160* :  terrorists, one driving in one in front. Yuland Nuri's 72-year-old aunt Adani Moshe was snatched
*07:48.160- 07:53.280* :  from her small community. When we meet in what's now known as hostages square in Tel Aviv,
*07:53.440- 07:58.900* :  he says the Israeli government must do a prisoner swap to bring her back. They took them for
*07:58.900- 08:03.540* :  purpose. This purpose should be negotiated and give them whatever they want and release those
*08:04.800- 08:09.220* :  hostages. And in past, hostage or deals, Israel has struck agreements eventually.
*08:11.200- 08:18.700* :  Back in 2006, a young soldier Galad Shalit was captured by Hamas. It took five painful years to
*08:18.700- 08:25.920* :  bring him home. He was exchanged for over a thousand Palestinian prisoners held in Israel
*08:25.920- 08:31.860* :  in a huge victory for Hamas. But Gershon Baskin, a key negotiator from back then,
*08:31.860- 08:38.000* :  doubts whether any major deal can now be done. What Hamas did, they crossed a line,
*08:38.740- 08:45.120* :  where it's inconceivable that they will continue to be in power in Gaza after this war is over.
*08:45.540- 08:50.660* :  So there's some kind of built-in contradiction to trying to negotiate with the people that you
*08:50.660- 08:53.600* :  intend on killing and making sure that they don't control the territory.
*08:55.640- 09:00.180* :  Early on, Qatar did broker the release of an American Israeli mother and daughter,
*09:00.500- 09:05.960* :  and Egypt helped bring out two Israeli hostages. But no bigger deal has taken shape.
*09:06.060- 09:12.940* :  With emotions running high, Israelis realize rescues are risky. Many back a prisoner exchange,
*09:12.940- 09:18.220* :  but aren't ready to stop battling Hamas, according to polls by Professor Tamar Herman
*09:18.260- 09:25.200* :  of the Israel Democracy Institute. The public is not really totally with the families.
*09:25.560- 09:31.220* :  Indeed, people are saying, bring them all back and we want them back. But when we asked,
*09:31.380- 09:38.820* :  okay, what about the timing? Should we, for example, accept a deal which includes stopping the
*09:38.820- 09:44.880* :  fighting, some kind of humanitarian ceasefire? The majority of the Israelis say no.
*09:47.740- 09:53.640* :  In Tel Aviv, at the start of every Jewish Sabbath, relative set a giant table with places set
*09:53.640- 10:01.080* :  for all those missing. Malky Shemtov's son, Omar, is 21. He was last seen at the dance party near
*10:01.080- 10:07.120* :  Gaza, and Malky follows every development in back-channel talks. It's better not to try to
*10:07.120- 10:14.120* :  accommodate or to have any opinion on it, and it is very difficult because for us, every small news,
*10:15.000- 10:23.100* :  it's a light. Increasingly frustrated, this week, Malkyren
*10:23.100- 10:28.740* :  others set off on a long march to the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, fears are growing for
*10:28.740- 10:35.180* :  the hostages. Hamas says some have been killed by Israeli airstrikes. Past experience taught
*10:35.180- 10:42.020* :  Israelis that deals could be done. But now, the intensity of the war is bringing a new level of
*10:42.020- 10:48.460* :  urgency. You'll learn now. China and the United States have a very troubled relationship,
*10:48.460- 10:53.120* :  from trade spats to disagreements over Taiwan. But that doesn't mean the leaders won't
*10:53.120- 10:57.920* :  talk to each other. In fact, the US President Joe Biden and China's leaders Xi Jinping
*10:57.920- 11:03.580* :  were meeting in California on Wednesday. It would only the second time they've come face-to-face
*11:03.580- 11:09.340* :  in their current roles. The meeting was taking place on the fringes of the summit of Asia-Pacific
*11:09.340- 11:12.920* :  leaders in San Francisco, and President Biden underlined its importance.
*11:13.740- 11:19.260* :  Mr President, we know each other for a long time. We haven't always agreed, which was not
*11:19.260- 11:24.720* :  surprised anyone. But our meetings have always been candid, straightforward, and useful.
*11:25.480- 11:31.360* :  I value our conversation because I think it's paramount that you and I understand each other
*11:31.360- 11:36.400* :  clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or miscommunication.
*11:37.060- 11:42.200* :  President Xi, for his part, called their relationship the most important bilateral one in the world.
*11:42.720- 11:47.080* :  I asked our correspondent, Gary Donahue, who's at the summit. What Mr Biden said specifically
*11:47.080- 11:52.980* :  about cooperation areas? The kinds of things where there is some kind of strategic coming together,
*11:52.980- 11:58.880* :  if you like, are areas perhaps on climate change on the green economy, where they see themselves
*11:58.880- 12:06.200* :  as having some joint interests. And although the US and China see the conflicts in Ukraine and the
*12:06.200- 12:11.680* :  Middle East in very, very different ways, I think there is some sense amongst some American
*12:11.680- 12:17.180* :  officials that China probably doesn't want a conflict in the Middle East, and it probably
*12:17.180- 12:21.460* :  doesn't want the same in Ukraine. So there may be some things they can work on there together,
*12:21.460- 12:27.700* :  but these two disagree on an awful lot of things, not least the status of Taiwan in the South China
*12:27.960- 12:33.180* :  Sea and the East China Sea, and where Americans have been coming into contact with Chinese,
*12:33.180- 12:39.160* :  naval, and air forces, and on issues of trade in particular America has imposed significant
*12:39.160- 12:44.180* :  tech embargoes on the transmission of sophisticated chip technology to China.
*12:44.580- 12:49.780* :  There's a lot of state now as there's particularly with the security situation in the Middle East,
*12:50.200- 12:57.040* :  and also the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. I suppose America wants to secure some kind of coming
*12:57.040- 13:02.440* :  together of minds over those issues. I think so, and I think that the best they can hope for is
*13:02.440- 13:08.500* :  perhaps for China to encourage Iran in the Middle East, not to escalate the situation. It's
*13:08.500- 13:14.340* :  influenced with groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen, that would be one aspect,
*13:14.340- 13:20.140* :  but really the aims of this summit are pretty low. Americans talk a lot about stabilization,
*13:20.340- 13:26.400* :  putting a floor under the relationship. They do want some things like reestablishing military
*13:26.400- 13:31.300* :  to military communications, which have been severed for more than a year now, and the problem
*13:31.300- 13:37.020* :  with that is that these two countries not talking means the risks of accidents happening,
*13:37.020- 13:42.380* :  and stuff escalating, getting out of control is very high, so I think those will be considered
*13:42.380- 13:47.560* :  as wins if they can do that along with anything else they can come and talk about in terms
*13:47.560- 13:52.280* :  of artificial intelligence, and on the question of the chemicals used in fentanyl production,
*13:52.280- 13:54.460* :  which is an epidemic in the States.
*13:54.460- 13:59.980* :  Gary O'Donoughhue in San Francisco. So what about the response to this meeting from social media?
*13:59.980- 14:04.360* :  I first found out about the official view from our Chinese media analyst, Karyala.
*14:05.000- 14:10.660* :  Whenever you see the US and Chinese leader come together, in state media there's always a very
*14:10.660- 14:15.740* :  positive message, although one thing I would say is that a word that has been emphasized
*14:15.920- 14:21.740* :  this time around with Xi and Biden meeting has been stabilizing ties. So there's been an
*14:21.740- 14:26.320* :  acknowledgement that since the two leaders met in the last year, there has been a lot of friction
*14:26.320- 14:31.080* :  between China and the US, and there is the hope that with them coming together to discuss
*14:31.080- 14:35.860* :  a range of issues that they'll be able to get that relationship back on track. That is the
*14:35.860- 14:41.980* :  top line from Chinese state media. Clearly it is not felt by everybody across that part of the
*14:42.020- 14:46.920* :  world. What unofficial responses have there been to this imminent meeting?
*14:47.860- 14:52.620* :  Well, while I'm looking at an independent media, so media in Hong Kong and Taiwan for example,
*14:52.620- 14:59.100* :  there are people who have been protesting outside the hotel that Xi Jinping is staying at on
*14:59.100- 15:06.080* :  issues like human rights. I've seen in a Taiwanese news agency that some Taiwanese reporters
*15:06.080- 15:11.180* :  trying to film, they've said that they've been harassed. You would never get any of this messaging
*15:11.180- 15:17.320* :  in state media in China. What people are seeing in China is a lot of Chinese people waving flags
*15:17.940- 15:23.500* :  very much wanting to welcome Xi Jinping. They're not having the impression that actually if there is
*15:23.500- 15:29.900* :  criticism towards Xi and that some people want to, with him being outside China, raise awareness
*15:29.900- 15:35.140* :  that they don't feel very positively about him. Now, Karen, it's a lot harder these days for that
*15:35.140- 15:39.060* :  kind of dissenting voice to come out of Hong Kong, but is there anything coming up?
*15:39.320- 15:46.120* :  Not on Chinese social media because generally any images of protest against the Chinese presidency,
*15:46.120- 15:52.220* :  the Chinese leadership is censored. But if Chinese people have access to a VPN, a piece of software
*15:52.220- 15:56.680* :  that allows them to circumvent the Chinese firewall, they might see reports in, for example,
*15:56.680- 16:02.060* :  the South China Morning Post newspaper, which shows that there have been people protesting in San
*16:02.060- 16:08.100* :  Francisco against Xi Jinping wanting to raise awareness about the weaker issue, about Taiwan.
*16:08.880- 16:14.020* :  But China's internal message very much wants to emphasize that Xi Jinping is welcome everywhere
*16:14.020- 16:19.240* :  around the world. But obviously, that is not the case that there are criticisms from people
*16:19.240- 16:23.620* :  within the US and also overseas Chinese towards the Chinese leader.

*17:23.340- 17:27.180* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*17:27.560- 17:32.980* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost a hundred million dollars
*17:32.980- 17:37.840* :  playing basketball. But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan
*17:37.840- 17:44.260* :  range is worth billions. And he made his real money as an NBA team owner. But controversially
*17:44.260- 17:50.060* :  turned against the players once his sneakers were off. So is he good bad or just another billionaire?

*18:00.840- 18:05.580* :  Every weekday morning, wake up to one big story from the African continent.
*18:05.800- 18:11.300* :  Where does Africa stand in this conflict? How is Africa responding to the refugee crisis?
*18:11.300- 18:17.840* :  With me, Alan, Kassudja, and Africa Daily. So what's it like living in an area with Boko Harama
*18:17.840- 18:21.820* :  active? One story from Africa. For Africa. Our story.
*18:22.340- 18:28.380* :  Africa Day. That's Africa Daily from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get to
*18:28.420- 18:29.160* :  BBC podcasts.
*18:31.660- 18:36.940* :  Silicon chips are the lifeblood of the modern economy. They are in everything around us and most of
*18:36.940- 18:43.200* :  them are now made in one place. Taiwan. The island is claimed by China and following Russia's
*18:43.200- 18:48.260* :  invasion of Ukraine. There's been a growing realization that having so much of the world's chip
*18:48.260- 18:53.280* :  production concentrated in one place may not be a great idea. But as our Asia correspondent
*18:53.280- 18:59.240* :  Rupert Winfield haze has been finding out, moving chip production away from Taiwan is no simple fix.
*19:00.760- 19:02.860* :  We invite to reshape the world.
*19:04.180- 19:10.920* :  I'm inside an enormous aircraft hangar-sized exhibition centre on the outskirts of the Taiwanese
*19:10.920- 19:18.100* :  capital Taipei and I'm surrounded by boobs with names of companies that I've never heard of and I
*19:18.100- 19:25.320* :  suspect most people have never heard of. This is where the semiconductor industry comes to show off
*19:25.320- 19:31.740* :  its wares. The reason why this semi-con 2023 is here in Taiwan is because Taiwan absolutely
*19:31.740- 19:37.140* :  dominates in a making of the semi-conductors that go into everything around us.
*19:39.660- 19:44.760* :  More than half of all the chips used worldwide are made here in Taiwan. The biggest
*19:44.760- 19:50.880* :  manufacturer Taiwan semi-conductor or TSMC is now the ninth most valuable company in the world.
*19:50.880- 19:56.880* :  That makes this island strategically very important and its chip plants extremely vulnerable.
*19:57.420- 20:01.640* :  In recent years, China's claims to Taiwan have become louder and more aggressive,
*20:01.640- 20:07.280* :  and so pressure is building to move production elsewhere. But replicating what Taiwan has done will
*20:07.280- 20:11.460* :  be much harder than building some new chip plants in Arizona and Dresden.
*20:14.860- 20:19.480* :  This is the city of Xinzhou about an hour south of Taipei and today Xinzhou is a world
*20:19.480- 20:25.600* :  center of chip making. On either side of the road here are the huge chip fabrication plants of
*20:25.600- 20:31.780* :  TSMC, each building the size of several football fields. The details of what goes on inside
*20:31.780- 20:37.620* :  them is a closely guarded secret, but these plants are considered the most mountain and efficient
*20:37.620- 20:45.000* :  in the world. The story of how Taiwan got here begins 44 years ago with a group of young engineers
*20:45.000- 20:49.900* :  and an experimental chip plant licensed from an American company called RCA.
*20:50.440- 20:54.200* :  The demonstration print that we built was the print manager.
*20:54.340- 21:00.460* :  One of those young engineers was Shichin Tai. It was surprised to everyone, to us and also to the
*21:00.460- 21:07.060* :  US RCA people. Sure and his team proved that Taiwan could not only make semi-conductors,
*21:07.060- 21:12.360* :  but do so better than the big US and Japanese makers. So how did they do it?
*21:12.680- 21:18.300* :  It may be a mystery. I think first is a brand new facility. Secondly,
*21:18.300- 21:24.480* :  we recruit the best engineer and also an operator that actually hands on in the factory.
*21:25.560- 21:27.540* :  Also very, very highly skilled.
*21:34.300- 21:39.780* :  This young man worked with one of Taiwan's biggest electronics companies. He describes low pay,
*21:39.780- 21:45.700* :  a strict hierarchy, and 12-hour days, six days a week. But unlike in the US and Europe,
*21:45.700- 21:49.360* :  he says Taiwan's engineering graduates have few other choices.
*21:53.080- 21:57.260* :  It's one of the few industries where you can make enough money to buy a car or get a mortgage,
*21:57.260- 22:01.780* :  he says. So even if working conditions are bad, people will still suck it up.
*22:01.780- 22:04.040* :  Other choice. So in just a second, suck up and accept.
*22:04.220- 22:10.940* :  The other key to success has been specialization. From the start, Shichin Tai says TSMC
*22:10.940- 22:17.740* :  decided it would not design or market its own chips. So that's the basic idea. You do not compete
*22:17.740- 22:24.720* :  with your partner. It was a service-oriented manufacturing. They do not have the product,
*22:25.080- 22:31.880* :  which means they collaborate with many, many customers. This has allowed TSMC to grow very fast.
*22:34.540- 22:41.940* :  It is this ecosystem that's now under threat. A conflict over Taiwan would have devastating
*22:41.940- 22:47.620* :  consequences, not just for the chip industry, but for the whole world economy. People here are
*22:47.620- 22:53.480* :  understandably proud of what Taiwan has achieved. Now in his 70s, Shichin Tai says he feels
*22:53.480- 22:58.960* :  extremely lucky to have played a small part. I hope the world appreciates how precious this
*22:58.960- 23:03.040* :  industry is. He says. And they don't do anything to destroy it.
*23:03.420- 23:09.440* :  Rupert Wingfield hates. The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator to Sudan says the violence
*23:09.440- 23:15.760* :  is verging on pure evil. The war between the Sudanese army and the rapid support forces began
*23:15.760- 23:21.540* :  seven months ago, but there has been a surge in violence in recent days. The fighting was originally
*23:21.540- 23:26.780* :  sparked by disagreements over a plan intended to lead to a transition to civilian rule.
*23:27.540- 23:32.280* :  So how has the war come to this point? Nulam Agavan has been speaking to our reporter,
*23:32.780- 23:37.400* :  Muhammad Hashim. When work broke out in Sudan in April this year,
*23:37.520- 23:43.640* :  it was over political differences between, on the one hand, the Sudanese army headed by General
*23:43.640- 23:49.200* :  Abdur Khilborhan, and on the other hand, the rapid support forces headed by General Muhammad Hamdan
*23:49.200- 23:56.760* :  Dagaluhuz also known as Hameti. And it was over the provisions of a framework agreement that
*23:56.760- 24:04.100* :  was being designed and orchestrated by the United Nations and the political opposition grouping
*24:04.100- 24:09.820* :  known as the Horses for Freedom and Change. And the thorny point then was the issue of merging
*24:09.820- 24:17.500* :  the rapid support forces into the army. Seven eight months on, the war is still ongoing in cartoon
*24:17.500- 24:23.380* :  between the army and the rapid support forces. And it's also taking place across the country in
*24:23.440- 24:32.000* :  Darfur, in particular where we've seen an uptick in the fighting over the past two weeks with the RSF
*24:32.000- 24:39.940* :  season Sudan's second largest city, Niala, and then seizing the cities of Geneva and Zalinji.
*24:40.080- 24:46.640* :  The problem is the fighting Darfur has an ethnic dimension as we've seen in West Darfur where the
*24:46.640- 24:53.740* :  rapid support forces and Arab militias backing them, have launched a campaign against Masalid
*24:53.740- 25:00.300* :  ethnicity. Some 8,000 people there were killed and more than half a million have fled from there
*25:00.300- 25:09.200* :  to Chad. But there is also inter-ethnic fighting between the Arab ethnic groups that support the RSF.
*25:09.540- 25:16.660* :  And we're hearing reports of a massacre that has happened south of Khartoum over the last
*25:16.660- 25:21.680* :  couple of days in a town called Jabal Aulia. So the situation over the country is not good,
*25:21.680- 25:25.860* :  there has been an uptick in the fighting in recent days. What do you know about the situation
*25:25.860- 25:31.920* :  of people on the ground? The situation on the ground is terrible. The warring parties, the Sudanese
*25:31.920- 25:37.540* :  army and the rapid support forces have failed in securing humanitarian corridors. For now,
*25:37.540- 25:42.760* :  most of the humanitarian community and the international staffers are struggling to come into
*25:42.760- 25:49.960* :  the country because of access and visa issues. But on the ground, people are struggling with
*25:50.240- 25:57.080* :  lack of food, lack of water, lack of power. You have to keep in mind that at the moment Sudan has
*25:57.080- 26:03.900* :  about seven million people internally displaced because of this war and it took it over the rainy
*26:03.900- 26:10.060* :  season. There have been the problems of the outbreaks of dengue fever and malaria and millions of
*26:10.060- 26:17.460* :  children are facing sorbation and malnourishment. And is there any hope about negotiations to come
*26:17.500- 26:23.420* :  to some sort of arrangement which would be peaceful? People have been watching the developments on
*26:23.420- 26:28.320* :  the political side of things. There is the Jeddah Forum where the two parties have been trying to
*26:28.320- 26:33.260* :  speak since the start of the war. Nothing has really come out of it. The head of the Sudanese
*26:33.260- 26:39.940* :  army, Abdullah Al-Burhan, was in Nairobi to try and have talks with President William Bruto
*26:40.480- 26:47.300* :  to see if EGAD could fast track some sort of a mediation process. And the political opposition
*26:47.300- 26:54.580* :  has been trying to somehow form some sort of a united civilian front efforts that that are failing.
*26:55.260- 26:59.680* :  At the moment, it doesn't seem like there is an end inside.
*27:00.480- 27:07.320* :  Mahana Hashim. The United Nations says 200,000 people have been displaced in Northeastern Myanmar
*27:07.840- 27:12.720* :  by fighting the began last month. There's also been an upsurge in fighting elsewhere in Myanmar.
*27:13.500- 27:16.140* :  Our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Mickey Bristow reports.
*27:17.080- 27:22.240* :  Late last month, clashes broke out in Northern Shand State between the army and a coalition of rebel
*27:22.240- 27:28.340* :  groups. The UN says tens of thousands of people have been displaced. Many of them moving towards
*27:28.340- 27:33.980* :  the border with next door China. Analysts said the army was facing its biggest military challenge
*27:33.980- 27:40.600* :  in seizing power in a coup in 2021. I think rebel groups have been battling the military for decades,
*27:41.280- 27:45.100* :  but there's been an increase in fighting across Myanmar over recent months.
*27:45.900- 27:49.320* :  An opposition government in waiting has also taken up arms.
*27:50.200- 27:55.600* :  An unprecedented heat wave in Brazil is saying temperatures continuing to reach over 40 degrees
*27:56.140- 28:00.280* :  Celsius. Electricity consumption broke records earlier this week as people across the country
*28:00.280- 28:04.520* :  turned on the air conditioning and the fans in a desperate attempt to stay cool.
*28:05.020- 28:09.980* :  Katie Watson has asked South America correspondent. Anant Butler asked her what kind of temperatures
*28:09.980- 28:17.660* :  she was experiencing. Well, here in Sao Paulo, reached 37.8 on Monday in Rio over the weekend,
*28:17.780- 28:23.540* :  42.5 degrees Celsius. And in fact, it felt like, because of the humidity,
*28:23.540- 28:29.980* :  the temperature felt like 58.5. It's certainly not an appealing prospect at the moment,
*28:29.980- 28:35.500* :  leaving any air-conditioned space. If you're lucky enough to have it, certainly people are trying
*28:35.500- 28:40.880* :  to stay indoors. There are red alerts across the country. There are 15 states with red alert,
*28:40.880- 28:45.620* :  including here in Sao Paulo and the federal capital. And that basically means the temperatures
*28:45.620- 28:51.440* :  may be five degrees above average for longer than five days and could pose a serious danger to health.
*28:51.440- 28:57.480* :  Yeah, red alerts. How does that affect an economy like Brazil's presumably all kinds of business
*28:57.480- 29:02.360* :  is taking usually operates outside, right? How are people functioning? How are businesses functioning?
*29:02.740- 29:06.720* :  Yeah, I mean, because of, I mean, you mentioned it there with energy consumption,
*29:06.720- 29:11.700* :  just breaking records. It means that there's been intermittent energy outages, certainly,
*29:11.700- 29:16.340* :  you know, across the country. And that's, you know, increasingly problematic, given that people
*29:16.340- 29:20.580* :  are desperate for air conditioning and may not even, you know, get access to that fridges,
*29:20.580- 29:24.480* :  that sort of thing. I mean, there's been reports of some shortages in supermarkets,
*29:25.000- 29:30.100* :  every business here, you know, into summer, or rather, it's a month before this beginning of summer.
*29:30.100- 29:34.500* :  So that's probably quite important is it's only set to get hotter. And so, you know, people just
*29:34.500- 29:40.640* :  trying to keep themselves cool. Businesses trying to function normally. Everyone here is suffering,
*29:40.640- 29:45.700* :  including transport. Of course, there's been outages on transport. Today is a bank holiday,
*29:45.700- 29:51.020* :  so it's actually relatively calm, relatively quiet on the streets, but the traffic yesterday
*29:51.020- 29:55.780* :  was terrible. People not being able to get to work and not being able to move around the city
*29:56.200- 30:00.520* :  and opting for road transport because some of the trains were down as well. So it's difficult.
*30:00.520- 30:04.640* :  I mean, certainly it's eased up because it's a holiday, but, you know, heading back on Thursday
*30:04.640- 30:09.440* :  and the temperatures are set to continue for the next few days. Katie Watson in São Paulo.
*30:10.260- 30:13.440* :  Now, there are two of the best known names in British acting. And together,
*30:13.440- 30:19.020* :  Pronella Scales and Timothy West have just celebrated 60 years of marriage. The couple first met
*30:19.020- 30:25.540* :  in 1961, filming a BBC play, which they say was an absolute stinker. But one good thing to come
*30:25.540- 30:30.680* :  out of it was their love story, which Timothy West has shared in a new book. He also writes about
*30:30.680- 30:35.360* :  what life has been life since his wife, Pronella, was diagnosed with vascular dementia.
*30:35.960- 30:39.340* :  Our entertainment correspondent Colin Patterson has been to meet them both.
*30:40.140- 30:44.120* :  We used to keep talking to each other through letter writing.
*30:45.280- 30:51.340* :  Theatre Royal Nottingham, October 1961. We didn't play on the Monday this week because,
*30:51.560- 30:55.600* :  in the afternoon, the stage was needed for an ambitious cookery demonstration.
*30:57.440- 31:04.380* :  You write just lovely letters, marvelous letters. Well, yes, we both loved writing to each other.
*31:04.820- 31:08.880* :  Sometimes, two or three times a day. Pronella Scales and Timothy West
*31:08.880- 31:14.200* :  sitting in the front room of their south-london home, looking back over 60 years of marriage.
*31:14.420- 31:19.560* :  Basil. Her most famous role was as civil faulty in faulty towers.
*31:19.820- 31:23.820* :  I don't like this could possibly be interested in an ageing, brilliant,
*31:23.820- 31:30.360* :  sticky insect like you. Timothy West is regarded as one of the finest stage actors of his generation.
*31:30.360- 31:38.360* :  I have full cause of weeping, but this heart should break into a hundred thousand flaws
*31:39.060- 31:43.700* :  or air I'll weep. And together, they had a recent unlikely hit with
*31:43.700- 31:45.740* :  Channel 4's Great Canal Journeys.
*31:47.160- 31:52.500* :  Cost off, please. But for the last 20 years, meaning for almost a third of their marriage,
*31:52.500- 31:58.500* :  Pronella Scales has had vascular dementia. It was 2001 when her husband first spotted
*31:58.500- 32:03.880* :  that something was not right. I came to see a play that Prone was doing. I went to see the
*32:03.880- 32:09.820* :  first night and it was fine. I was much enjoyed by the audience. I went to see it again a bit later
*32:09.820- 32:14.420* :  and I thought Prone was a bit strange. She's done totally with it. I mean, it wouldn't have
*32:14.420- 32:21.920* :  bothered any ordinary member of the audience, but I knew that she had just not quite been on top of it.
*32:22.300- 32:26.780* :  It was more than a decade later that the diagnosis for dementia. Yes, it was.
*32:26.780- 32:33.400* :  Yes, it was. We went to see a specialist who just said, I'm sorry, you know, this is just
*32:33.400- 32:37.980* :  something that happens to you. When you get older, it's not going to get any easier,
*32:39.100- 32:41.960* :  but you can cope with it. Don't let it catch you down.
*32:43.400- 32:48.600* :  And somehow we have cope with it and Prone doesn't really sort of think about it, do you?
*32:48.900- 32:54.340* :  Want my love? No, well, they want it. I don't think about it, but what don't I think about?
*32:55.200- 33:01.820* :  Dementia. Dementia. You're not bothered by it, are you? Well, I think
*33:02.860- 33:09.320* :  elderly people get it anywhere, don't they? Well, some do, yes. We manage.
*33:09.720- 33:14.760* :  Timothy West decided that the year of their diamond wedding anniversary was the perfect time to
*33:14.760- 33:21.020* :  prune me a love story, which doesn't shy away from talking about dementia, but understandably
*33:21.020- 33:27.220* :  mainly focuses on the fun. Have you read it at all? Yes, I read some of it. How do you feel your
*33:27.220- 33:36.440* :  relationship has changed over the years? I don't think it's changed at all. No, no, no. I've got to
*33:36.440- 33:42.020* :  nail him better and better and better. Pronella Scales and Timothy West speaking to Colin Patterson.
*33:44.760- 33:48.740* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:48.960- 33:52.880* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email,
*33:52.880- 33:59.200* :  the address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on x, formerly known as Twitter,
*33:59.200- 34:04.520* :  at Global News Podcast. This edition was mixed by Chris Hanson and the producer was Oliver Burla,
*34:04.900- 34:08.360* :  the editor is Karen Martin. I'm Nick Miles and until next time, goodbye.
*34:16.960- 34:21.280* :  I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zing Sing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*34:21.540- 34:25.360* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*34:25.740- 34:31.140* :  Considered at the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost a hundred million dollars
*34:31.540- 34:36.360* :  playing basketball. But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range
*34:36.360- 34:42.760* :  is worth billions. And he made his real money as an NBA team owner, but controversially turned
*34:42.760- 34:48.240* :  against the players once his sneakers were off. So is he good bad or just another billionaire?
*34:48.520- 34:51.940* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
