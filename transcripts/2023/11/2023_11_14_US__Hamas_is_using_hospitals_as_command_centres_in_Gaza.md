*00:48.540- 00:50.980* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:53.020- 00:57.980* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Wednesday 15th November, these are the main headlines.
*00:57.980- 01:04.100* :  Washington backs up what Israel has long claimed that Hamas is using hospitals as command centers
*01:04.100- 01:09.220* :  and weapons dumps. So where does that leave the hundreds of patients and people sheltering in them?
*01:09.700- 01:13.640* :  The British Prime Minister faces a stinging terrain from a sacked minister,
*01:14.180- 01:19.440* :  and Sri Lanka's Supreme Court finds the former president partially responsible for the country's
*01:19.440- 01:26.360* :  economic collapse. Also in this podcast, the main advantage of this AI approach is that it's
*01:26.360- 01:30.220* :  extremely accurate. It learns from decades of data. It doesn't solve a complex equation,
*01:30.220- 01:32.940* :  so it can make prediction extremely fast on a very small machine.
*01:33.560- 01:35.780* :  We hear how AI could predict the weather.
*01:39.660- 01:44.740* :  For several weeks now, Israel has said many of the hospitals and guards have a dual function.
*01:45.160- 01:48.900* :  Above ground, they're treating patients, but underneath in a warrant of tunnels,
*01:48.900- 01:54.900* :  they are Hamas command centers and weapon stores. It's something Hamas has consistently denied,
*01:54.900- 01:59.660* :  but now the United States says it has intelligence to support those Israeli claims.
*01:59.680- 02:03.060* :  Sabrina Singh is the Pentagon's deputy spokesperson.
*02:03.100- 02:09.560* :  They have tunnels underneath these hospitals, and so Hamas and P.I.J members operate a
*02:09.560- 02:14.860* :  command and control node from Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. They have weapons stored there,
*02:15.400- 02:19.640* :  and are prepared to respond to an Israeli military operation against the facility.
*02:19.640- 02:25.420* :  Well, the reference to P.I.J there stands for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group in
*02:25.420- 02:31.340* :  Gaza. The U.S. National Security spokesman John Kirby has said that using the Al-Shifa hospital
*02:31.340- 02:36.760* :  in this way was a war crime, but it did not lessen Israel's responsibility to protect civilians.
*02:37.540- 02:41.840* :  I've been speaking to our correspondent Nick Beak, who gave us the latest on the situation across
*02:41.840- 02:47.180* :  Gaza. The Israelis say that their operations continue. Just tonight, the defense minister here in
*02:47.180- 02:52.260* :  Israel has said that the campaign will go on for many, many months, so that's an indication that
*02:52.460- 02:58.020* :  there appears to be no imminent dialing down of what's been happening. I mean, for example,
*02:58.020- 03:03.920* :  there was one particular air strike in the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. At least seven
*03:03.920- 03:09.480* :  people were killed in that. Israel says it continues to target Hamas. It says it's not aiming
*03:09.480- 03:15.260* :  for civilians. Just a few miles away from that particular refugee camp is the Al-Shifa hospital,
*03:15.680- 03:21.020* :  and they sort of, our by our neck, we've got more information that's trickled out from the hospital,
*03:21.560- 03:27.680* :  and all of it pretty bleak. One medic telling the BBC today that more than 200 bodies have now
*03:27.680- 03:33.500* :  been buried in what is a mass grave, and there is also a concern. One other doctor was telling us
*03:33.500- 03:40.740* :  about the risk of infection from the corpses at the site. Also, I was talking to one charity,
*03:41.280- 03:45.280* :  doctors without borders, and they were saying that one of their surgeons treated three people
*03:45.280- 03:50.920* :  yesterday for shotgun injuries or certainly sniper injuries, and they say that they believe
*03:50.920- 03:57.240* :  Israeli forces and pulled the trigger. Israel, as I say, denies that it fires towards the hospital
*03:57.240- 04:03.080* :  or at civilians there. Meanwhile, Nick, pressure is continuing to build on Benjamin Netanyahu,
*04:03.080- 04:06.540* :  isn't it? Over the hostages. There's a march in Israel at the moment,
*04:06.540- 04:13.060* :  relatives meeting the Red Cross in Geneva as well. Yeah, that's right. Just earlier on today,
*04:13.060- 04:19.720* :  actually, a group of the relatives of some of the 240 hostages set off from Tel Aviv,
*04:19.720- 04:24.140* :  and we're told that they're going to be carrying out this five-day march. They're heading here
*04:24.140- 04:28.460* :  for Jerusalem. They're going to the office of the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
*04:28.960- 04:33.800* :  and they're demanding that he does more, that really he changes the strategy of this war,
*04:34.120- 04:37.540* :  because remember at the moment, the Prime Minister says that the best way of getting the hostages
*04:37.540- 04:44.120* :  back is to intensify the ground operation in Gaza to take out more Hamas fighters, and at that
*04:44.120- 04:49.140* :  point, in a position of strength, the hostages can be freed. Lots of the families of the hostages
*04:49.140- 04:53.780* :  say that's completely the wrong strategy, and actually, the focus should be on trying to retrieve
*04:53.780- 04:58.660* :  them first of all, and then going for Hamas afterwards. But at the moment, there seems to be no
*04:58.660- 05:04.540* :  aligning of those two different positions. All the while, Nick, we hear the swirl of information
*05:04.560- 05:09.880* :  about possible deals, but so far, there's no clear sign that one may be reached anytime soon.
*05:10.580- 05:15.620* :  That was Nick Beak. The World Health Organization has said that more than half of Gaza's
*05:15.620- 05:21.160* :  hospitals are non-functional, and those that are still open are barely enough supplies to sustain
*05:21.160- 05:27.620* :  them. An estimated 160 children are expected to be born every day in Gaza, even as many women
*05:27.620- 05:34.740* :  are cut off from safe delivery services. Working with freelance journalist Maddi Fati in Gaza,
*05:34.740- 05:39.900* :  I correspond to Yogi Te Limai reports from Jerusalem on what it's like to give birth in Gaza.
*05:44.580- 05:48.960* :  A one-day-old baby boy is brought into the neonatal intensive care unit
*05:48.960- 05:56.420* :  of Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza. He's still to be named by his parents who fled Gaza City
*05:56.420- 06:02.900* :  in the north after warnings from the Israeli military. Born prematurely under the stress of war,
*06:02.900- 06:11.240* :  he needs help to breathe. Next to him is a four-day-old girl in critical condition.
*06:12.160- 06:18.420* :  She's on a ventilator, and her tiny hand has been attached to a drip. She doesn't have a name either,
*06:18.920- 06:24.520* :  and they're running out of medicines to treat her. The incubators are still on at this hospital,
*06:24.520- 06:33.800* :  but the fighting is drawing closer. Nurse Farda Alavda points to another baby in the corner
*06:33.800- 06:38.580* :  sleeping soundly. Two weeks old, his name is Hassan Mishmash.
*06:41.880- 06:47.040* :  He was rescued from under the rubble, cradled in his mother's arms. Both his parents have been
*06:47.040- 06:52.720* :  killed. Since his parents are no longer alive, all of us nurses have taken on the responsibility
*07:00.700- 07:05.360* :  of caring for him. Outside in the hospital's compound, new tents are being erected to shelter
*07:05.360- 07:14.400* :  those fleeing northern Gaza. Asma has recently arrived here with three small children. She's
*07:14.400- 07:20.820* :  pregnant and walked for more than 15 miles. Plastic and cotton sheets make the walls and roof
*07:20.820- 07:26.460* :  of her makeshift tent. She sleeps on the ground. The plastic sheet, her children's sleep on,
*07:26.460- 07:34.760* :  isn't big enough to fit them all. So many women suffered miscarriages due to the terrifying sound
*07:34.760- 07:41.320* :  of the explosions. I was scared I would lose my baby. Sometimes I felt like I couldn't feel my baby
*07:41.320- 07:47.920* :  move. I had to carry my child and our bags. My children have been exposed to such horrors,
*07:47.920- 07:55.960* :  dead bodies, cars bombed with people inside. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced in Gaza,
*07:56.460- 08:01.340* :  crowding in shelters in hospitals and schools. In the cities and towns they've left,
*08:01.340- 08:06.640* :  they had homes and jobs. Now they're struggling for a bit of food for their families.
*08:10.820- 08:17.040* :  In one corner of the shelter, a little girl bangs a tap. Frustrated, she then puts her finger into
*08:17.040- 08:23.060* :  its nozzle, hoping some water will come out to fill a small plastic bottle she's carrying. None
*08:23.060- 08:31.360* :  does. There's an acute shortage of water. Amidst at all, Ola Abu Ali gave birth at the shelter.
*08:34.020- 08:39.480* :  My baby is only two weeks old, born right here in the school during the war.
*08:40.180- 08:46.700* :  We don't have access to food, milk or diapers. There isn't enough to eat and there is no water.
*08:47.620- 08:53.400* :  My children have diarrhea. My baby has stomach inflammation and whenever I breastfeed him,
*08:53.400- 09:07.460* :  he vomits. Gefa Alassar's baby is even younger, a girl born four days ago. Gefa was heavily pregnant
*09:07.460- 09:13.800* :  when she was forced to flee her home. I've had to run more than once, walking under the constant
*09:13.800- 09:21.180* :  threat of being bombed. I saw people's bodies being gripped apart. I faced extreme exhaustion and
*09:21.180- 09:26.960* :  was scared for my baby's life. At hospital, I got no painkillers while giving birth.
*09:29.360- 09:34.960* :  It is a painful time in Gaza. It's excruciating, thinning mothers.
*09:38.740- 09:45.740* :  Yogi Te Limai reporting. The weather is one of the most complex natural systems on Earth.
*09:46.420- 09:52.060* :  Learning to forecast it accurately has transformed the way we live, work and undoubtedly saved
*09:52.060- 09:57.620* :  many lives. Traditional weather forecasts involve huge amounts of data and use some of the biggest
*09:57.620- 10:02.960* :  supercomputers in the world. But research just published shows that artificial intelligence can
*10:02.960- 10:08.540* :  actually forecast more accurately, far more quickly than what's come before. Our climate editor,
*10:08.540- 10:14.300* :  Justin Rolot, is following the story. It's quite hard to measure how effective it is because there are
*10:14.300- 10:18.460* :  so many variables that come out of a weather forecast because it's trying to do so much. It's trying to
*10:18.460- 10:23.280* :  describe the pattern of weather around the whole world. So there had a couple of examples for me.
*10:23.540- 10:29.220* :  One of which was looking at tracking big storm cyclones, which is particularly good at. They said
*10:29.220- 10:34.340* :  look at cyclone Lee. This was a big storm that developed in the Caribbean, but then struck the
*10:34.340- 10:41.420* :  Atlantic coast of the US and Canada. The AI models accurately predicted its path nine days ahead.
*10:41.420- 10:45.760* :  The traditional forecasting models only did six days ahead. So they were saying look at that and
*10:45.760- 10:50.380* :  that shows you get more warning to kind of if you like batten down the hatches and protect your
*10:50.380- 10:55.360* :  communities. So it's really good at some things like predicting cyclones. Another way of looking at
*10:55.360- 11:00.080* :  is to look at the output of the models. So these variables that the models create and look how accurate
*11:00.080- 11:06.240* :  it is on those. They said if you look across 1,400 of these variables, they're sort of key ones.
*11:06.240- 11:12.760* :  It's better than the gold standard weather models 90% of the time. And if you take the top of
*11:12.760- 11:18.060* :  the atmosphere, the troposphere out, which is kind of irrelevant to most of us because we care about
*11:18.060- 11:22.940* :  the weather, where we are at the bottom of the atmosphere on the earth's surface, then it's like 99%
*11:23.500- 11:28.780* :  better. So the performance levels are really high. I have to say though, the granularity, the level
*11:28.780- 11:33.600* :  of detail is much lower with these AI models as they stand at the moment. Okay, and they've been
*11:33.600- 11:38.980* :  talking to you, the people who have developed this, about what it means in practice. Yeah, so I
*11:38.980- 11:43.660* :  said this guy, Remi Lamb, he was one of the key designers, works for Google DeepMind, which is
*11:43.980- 11:49.000* :  Google's kind of AIR. And this is all open source stuff. So they're publishing this and allowing
*11:49.000- 11:53.980* :  anyone to use it and do what they want with it. So it's kind of generous science that DeepMind
*11:53.980- 11:58.120* :  are doing. And this is what Remi Lamb had to say when I said what are the advantages of this
*11:58.260- 12:02.560* :  approach? The main advantage of this AI approach is that it's extremely accurate. It learns from
*12:02.560- 12:07.120* :  decades of data and is able to be more accurate than the industry gold standard. It doesn't
*12:07.120- 12:11.480* :  solve a complex equation, so it can make pretty much extremely fast on a very small machine.
*12:11.860- 12:16.580* :  An accurate means potentially life-saving. I mean, we think of weather forecasts, like what's
*12:16.580- 12:20.020* :  the weather going to be like this afternoon? Should I wear a coat? And they're really good for that.
*12:20.020- 12:24.220* :  But they're also really good for extreme events. If you've got a big storm developing,
*12:24.220- 12:27.840* :  you kind of want to know about it. So you can warn people either to stay at home, get down and
*12:27.840- 12:33.560* :  take cover, or actually to evacuate people in really big storms. So weather forecasts can save lives.
*12:33.860- 12:39.080* :  We are seeing, though, increasingly unpredictable events, like the recent hurricane that hit
*12:39.080- 12:45.220* :  Acabulco, with practically no warning whatsoever. AI is going to be quite difficult to predict
*12:45.220- 12:49.400* :  those kind of things. Yeah, I mean, that's very true. But actually, traditional weather forecasts
*12:49.400- 12:53.900* :  aren't very good at predicting those things because they're new and because they're very localised.
*12:53.920- 12:57.740* :  This rapid intensification, it's called, of storms, is something that's actually
*12:58.280- 13:02.680* :  we haven't seen in great deal of, but is forecast to become a bigger problem as the world warms up.
*13:02.680- 13:06.460* :  And it's really because you've got warmer ocean water, warmer air, which means more energy,
*13:06.460- 13:10.180* :  which means you can create bigger storms. The storm you're talking about, Hurricane Otis,
*13:10.180- 13:14.400* :  was really spectacular. So, I mean, there were weather forecasts just talking about going to bed
*13:14.400- 13:18.740* :  overnight and it was a tropical cyclone. It was like a no-worthy storm, but nothing to worry about.
*13:18.980- 13:22.920* :  Woke up in the morning, it was a category five hurricane. It was actually the strongest hurricane
*13:22.920- 13:27.680* :  ever to hit the Pacific coast of Mexico and it developed in 24 hours. That is really unusual.
*13:28.200- 13:33.540* :  But it is hard to predict those things anyway just because we don't have the detailed measurements
*13:33.600- 13:38.360* :  that would allow us to look at the way that they heat propagating the storms and creating these
*13:38.360- 13:44.760* :  really big storms. Just in rolet. Just a day ago, the British media was buzzing with Prime Minister
*13:44.760- 13:50.440* :  Rishi Sunak's radical government reshuffle. What a course such a storm was his decision to fire his
*13:50.440- 13:55.300* :  troublesome home secretary, Suela Braverman, as well as the stunning return to government as
*13:55.300- 14:00.340* :  foreign secretary of the former Prime Minister, David Cameron. But any hope Mr Sunak might have
*14:00.340- 14:06.180* :  had of ushering in a period of calm has been shattered. The reason a scathing letter from Ms Braverman
*14:06.180- 14:12.060* :  in which she tears to pieces, Mr Sunak's leadership. Our political correspondent Rob Watson has
*14:12.060- 14:17.260* :  been speaking to me about it all. I've been covering British politics on and off for over 30 years,
*14:17.580- 14:24.280* :  and I don't think I've ever read a more vicious, stinging attack from an outgoing minister
*14:24.280- 14:29.000* :  than this. I mean, it is quite extraordinary because it attacks Rishi Sunak as a man,
*14:29.740- 14:34.580* :  as a politician and as a leader, as a man by saying that he'd betrayed pledges to her as a
*14:34.580- 14:40.600* :  politician saying he'd attempted all these resets which had failed. And as a leader by saying that
*14:40.600- 14:45.800* :  in the face of growing anti-Semitism and extremism in the wake of the Hamas attacks,
*14:46.320- 14:52.440* :  he had been weak and uncertain. I mean, it just doesn't get more stinging and vicious than that.
*14:52.620- 14:56.520* :  Certainly, it's been a lot of muttering about her ambitions as a leader herself,
*14:56.520- 15:00.980* :  but is this clear evidence of that, do you think? I think it is, but I think more interestingly,
*15:00.980- 15:07.560* :  perhaps, it's a sort of taste of what might happen if the conservatives lose the next general
*15:07.560- 15:12.180* :  election, and that is that they'll be the sort of almighty battle for the soul of the party,
*15:12.180- 15:17.340* :  those who want it to be a really sort of full-throated, full-blooded, a right-wing party. I mean,
*15:17.340- 15:21.760* :  that would, of course, be swell a brother, and those who want it to be a little bit more
*15:21.760- 15:26.900* :  centrist. It's a taste, perhaps, of the battle to come. And all this roul really is just going to
*15:26.900- 15:33.600* :  do nothing further. The attempts from Mr. Sunak to tighten that gap between him and Labour at the
*15:34.020- 15:38.080* :  moment. It's worth pointing that out, Nick. I mean, they are consistently something like 20
*15:38.080- 15:43.700* :  percentage points behind after 13 years in office. I mean, it really does look unless Sunak
*15:43.700- 15:47.920* :  turns up that they're headed for a hammering. And I think when people see things like this,
*15:48.380- 15:51.520* :  they will look at the conservative party and think, you know, if it was a marriage,
*15:51.520- 15:56.980* :  it would be a deep trouble. If it was a relationship, people would be looking at it and thinking,
*15:56.980- 16:01.400* :  my goodness, these people need help, not real acting. Rob Watson.
*16:03.400- 16:04.020* :  Come me up later on.
*16:05.880- 16:07.620* :  You hear it when you're laying in bed at 18.

*16:13.280- 16:17.560* :  The strange noise that's keeping residents in a northern Irish town awake at night.

*17:12.520- 17:16.440* :  My question for crowd science is, are artistic brains different?
*17:16.700- 17:20.100* :  Stick with me because there's been some really fascinating research into this.
*17:20.200- 17:22.420* :  That's Crowd Science from the BBC World Service.
*17:22.620- 17:23.820* :  I love this question.

*17:26.980- 17:27.260* :  Wow!
*17:28.460- 17:33.060* :  Finland says an unusual number of asylum seekers have been arriving at its
*17:33.060- 17:35.640* :  1,300 km long border with Russia.
*17:35.980- 17:39.920* :  The authority said about 60 people had sought refuge since early Monday,
*17:39.920- 17:43.440* :  compared with 91 arrivals over the previous three months.
*17:43.500- 17:49.340* :  Finland's interior minister, Mari Rantonen, told reporters that Russia was allowing people
*17:49.340- 17:52.920* :  from third countries to travel illegally without the right papers.
*17:56.500- 17:59.380* :  In recent months, according to the Border Guard's observations,
*17:59.380- 18:03.080* :  the number of asylum seekers has increased on the eastern border,
*18:03.640- 18:06.760* :  and there have been changes in the nationalities of arrivals.
*18:07.540- 18:10.480* :  The number of asylum seekers is still relatively low,
*18:10.480- 18:14.580* :  but the number has significantly increased in the short term.
*18:15.240- 18:17.420* :  The actions of Russian authorities have changed,
*18:17.420- 18:22.940* :  such that traveling from Russia to Finland is permitted despite document deficiencies.
*18:23.540- 18:25.860* :  Therefore, this is about a legal entry.
*18:26.500- 18:30.500* :  Charlie Salonius Pastanak is a defence and security researcher at the Finnish
*18:30.500- 18:32.340* :  Institute of International Affairs.
*18:32.880- 18:35.120* :  There's clearly an increase in the rate of immigration,
*18:35.120- 18:37.540* :  but still only numbering in the dozens.
*18:37.660- 18:41.640* :  My colleague Tim Franks asked, how big a deal is this for Finland?
*18:41.660- 18:46.700* :  They're seen as a harbinger of what could come.
*18:47.300- 18:51.860* :  The Finnish authorities are remembering what happened in 2015-16,
*18:52.620- 18:57.480* :  when hundreds and eventually some thousands came across the border in very much the same way,
*18:57.480- 19:00.820* :  with Russian authorities just letting these people through.
*19:01.540- 19:05.340* :  Finnish politicians and the authorities are being very proactive.
*19:06.000- 19:12.080* :  Of course, 30-40 people are no problem to Finland in terms of taking care.
*19:12.220- 19:13.240* :  People like that.
*19:13.720- 19:19.420* :  What level of proof has the Finnish government been able to bring to say,
*19:19.420- 19:23.080* :  we know that this is the Russians getting up to mischief?
*19:23.080- 19:26.400* :  Publicly what the Finnish authorities have said is,
*19:27.000- 19:30.620* :  they know that the Russian counterparts are letting through people.
*19:30.620- 19:32.880* :  They've changed their behaviour quite dramatically.
*19:33.680- 19:39.520* :  Groups of these individuals being carted in vans and the Russian border authorities
*19:40.100- 19:42.100* :  helping these individuals onwards.
*19:42.580- 19:49.300* :  I guess it's not being viewed as a coincidence in Finland that this is all happening after the
*19:49.300- 19:53.060* :  country recently became a member of NATO, the Western military alliance.
*19:53.300- 19:55.300* :  That is the overall framework.
*19:55.980- 19:58.360* :  There was an expectation in fact that Russia would do more,
*19:58.360- 20:03.220* :  but now there's this whole basket of other deniable hybrid tools.
*20:04.100- 20:08.540* :  Russia doesn't have one master plan, but there's certainly a desire to see
*20:09.040- 20:12.460* :  the destabilisation of societies, countries in Europe,
*20:12.920- 20:16.600* :  maybe internal political wrangling caused by migration and things like that.
*20:16.600- 20:22.760* :  So if Russia can aid in a bet in this, then it's quite cheap for it to do.
*20:23.240- 20:26.640* :  And at the same time send a signal to much of the rest of Europe
*20:26.640- 20:30.740* :  that we have lots of migrants who we may choose to push onwards.
*20:31.340- 20:32.980* :  That was Charlie Saloni's past and act.
*20:34.180- 20:38.600* :  The term economic crisis hardly does justice to what people in Sri Lanka have had to
*20:38.600- 20:39.480* :  endure recently.
*20:39.940- 20:42.920* :  Last year, surging fuel prices led to basics like bread,
*20:43.160- 20:44.780* :  trembling in price for a while.
*20:44.780- 20:48.160* :  There were violent protests on the streets, parliament was stormed,
*20:48.300- 20:49.500* :  and the president resigned.
*20:49.580- 20:53.100* :  When now the country's Supreme Court has found that the former president
*20:53.100- 20:56.760* :  got the bio-Rajapaksa, his brother Mahinda and other top officials,
*20:57.080- 20:59.680* :  were partially responsible for the economic collapse.
*21:00.220- 21:02.520* :  I asked the BBC's South Asia regional editor,
*21:02.760- 21:04.940* :  Ambrata and Itta Rajan, what this ruling means.
*21:05.620- 21:08.700* :  It's a symbolic judgment by the Sri Lankan Supreme Court.
*21:09.240- 21:12.880* :  The Sri Lankan advocacy group, Transparency International Sri Lanka,
*21:13.080- 21:16.520* :  they approached the court saying the fundamental rights
*21:16.520- 21:21.380* :  of the people have been violated because of the ongoing economic crisis
*21:22.020- 21:23.840* :  and the people suffered heavily.
*21:24.200- 21:28.140* :  So the Supreme Court has ruled that the former president,
*21:28.140- 21:31.780* :  the go-to bio-Rajapaksa, is elder brother Mahinda,
*21:31.780- 21:35.100* :  who was also a president before and he was the prime minister
*21:35.680- 21:36.180* :  later on.
*21:36.180- 21:40.780* :  And the younger one, Basil Rajapakri was the finance minister
*21:40.960- 21:43.560* :  and two central bank, former central bank governors,
*21:43.560- 21:47.900* :  and two other officials were held responsible for the economic crisis.
*21:48.400- 21:50.000* :  Since it is a symbolic judgment,
*21:50.000- 21:52.060* :  they did not order any punishment
*21:52.200- 21:55.560* :  or asking them to pay millions of dollars or anything.
*21:55.560- 22:00.360* :  It only said since the advocacy group was asking for responsibility,
*22:00.980- 22:06.880* :  so they only asked to pay $450 as legal costs for the petitioners.
*22:07.260- 22:10.340* :  So the Supreme Court simply reiterated the view
*22:10.340- 22:13.020* :  that the Rajapakri brothers, when they were in power,
*22:13.020- 22:16.300* :  they did not do much to stop this economic slight.
*22:16.840- 22:20.220* :  Ambrata, will this symbolic judgment, as you call it,
*22:20.620- 22:21.340* :  be enough for people.
*22:21.340- 22:23.720* :  There must be a lot of anger amongst Sri Lanka still.
*22:24.080- 22:26.120* :  There is a lot of anger in Sri Lanka at the moment,
*22:26.200- 22:28.740* :  but what many people would say is they are helpless
*22:28.740- 22:31.460* :  because after Mr. Rajapakri left,
*22:31.460- 22:34.580* :  and Ranil Vikram Singh, he took over as president
*22:35.200- 22:38.740* :  and he got the money from IMF to kickstart the economy.
*22:39.200- 22:43.060* :  But in the meantime, the prices have gone up quite exorbitantly.
*22:43.200- 22:43.940* :  And they are struggling.
*22:43.940- 22:47.700* :  In fact, thousands of Sri Lankans are leaving the country in droves,
*22:47.740- 22:50.980* :  looking for better opportunities outside in the Middle East
*22:51.000- 22:54.680* :  or in Southeast Asia or even in places like Korea.
*22:54.920- 22:57.000* :  But they have such a huge amount of debt.
*22:57.000- 23:00.240* :  In fact, they are still negotiating with many countries
*23:00.240- 23:02.260* :  like China, India, Japan.
*23:02.260- 23:05.720* :  The Sri Lankan government has to make very difficult choices
*23:06.300- 23:08.380* :  in the coming months or even in the coming years.
*23:08.500- 23:10.140* :  So the people are very angry.
*23:10.140- 23:12.380* :  But how can they show that anger?
*23:12.380- 23:14.120* :  Because the protest movement is gone.
*23:14.320- 23:18.220* :  Now, this anger can be replicated or shown only in terms of election.
*23:18.220- 23:19.760* :  That is what many people are asking.
*23:20.300- 23:22.080* :  The Sri Lanka should have elections soon
*23:22.140- 23:24.720* :  so that they can elect a new government they can trust.
*23:25.680- 23:26.800* :  Amber Sanita Rajin.
*23:27.320- 23:30.420* :  Tuesday was the last day of the hearing
*23:30.420- 23:34.220* :  and court behind closed doors for the Russian anti-war activist,
*23:34.220- 23:36.020* :  Alexandra Scott Chilenko.
*23:36.560- 23:39.400* :  The St. Petersburg artist was detained in March 2022
*23:39.940- 23:41.960* :  after changing price tags in supermarkets
*23:41.960- 23:44.940* :  with stickers containing information about the war in Ukraine.
*23:45.780- 23:49.540* :  After more than 18 months, her trial is in its final stage.
*23:50.100- 23:53.480* :  33-year-old Alexandra faces a sentence of up to eight years
*23:53.480- 23:54.360* :  in a labor camp.
*23:54.900- 23:57.440* :  Our reporter Anastasia Slato Poltsky
*23:57.840- 24:00.760* :  met up with Sasha's older sister Anna, who lives in France.
*24:07.740- 24:10.760* :  Dozens came to the St. Petersburg court to support Alexandra.
*24:10.760- 24:13.800* :  It's her last hearing before the verdict is announced.
*24:14.360- 24:17.300* :  She is now one of the most known political prisoners in Russia.
*24:23.620- 24:26.420* :  With Alexandra accused of discrediting the Russian army,
*24:26.500- 24:30.820* :  the prosecutor has requested a sentence of eight years at a walk colony.
*24:33.800- 24:36.900* :  She's a symbol of everything Russian authorities hate.
*24:37.020- 24:40.220* :  She's artistic, fragile, lesbian,
*24:40.740- 24:42.320* :  having a Ukrainian surname.
*24:42.320- 24:46.120* :  She closed all the checkmarks of whom you should not be.
*24:51.000- 24:54.700* :  I met Alexandra's older sister Anna in Paris, where she lives.
*24:55.520- 24:58.400* :  She got permission to visit her sister in prison several times
*24:58.740- 24:59.940* :  over the past year and a half.
*25:01.460- 25:05.360* :  Dorzhtonata is a Nazi dancer forced on her.
*25:06.240- 25:07.040* :  Why is she there?
*25:07.380- 25:08.640* :  It's not a place for her.
*25:09.240- 25:10.020* :  What did she do?
*25:10.320- 25:14.120* :  She didn't hurt or kill anyone, break or steal anything.
*25:14.580- 25:17.020* :  She didn't burn a military recruitment office.
*25:17.420- 25:19.680* :  She didn't solicit anyone to any activity.
*25:19.680- 25:22.640* :  She didn't even organize any political act.
*25:22.860- 25:23.580* :  It's a mistake.
*25:24.920- 25:28.500* :  Alexandra suffers from celiac disease and chronic heart problems
*25:28.500- 25:30.300* :  as well as neurological disorders.
*25:30.960- 25:33.360* :  In detention, her state of health has become critical.
*25:36.940- 25:39.480* :  There was even a moment when she cried in court.
*25:40.260- 25:42.960* :  It's a sign that her strengths are on the limit.
*25:43.540- 25:44.580* :  I am proud of her.
*25:44.920- 25:46.140* :  She is extremely brave.
*25:46.140- 25:48.740* :  She's the most courageous person I know.
*25:49.420- 25:52.280* :  But this bride is with pain and bitterness.
*25:52.920- 25:54.720* :  It is destructive for her.
*25:56.460- 25:57.700* :  Anna is not giving up hope,
*25:58.060- 26:00.820* :  but understands her system might face a tough sentence.
*26:05.100- 26:08.080* :  Imagining the sentence that Sasha will get,
*26:08.080- 26:12.100* :  that she will have to live in the work colony with those healthy shoes,
*26:13.060- 26:15.520* :  we will do whatever is possible to support her,
*26:15.980- 26:16.760* :  but I'm terrified.
*26:18.000- 26:20.160* :  We are all aware that at any moment,
*26:20.160- 26:23.600* :  Sasha can die behind bars in the detention center,
*26:24.080- 26:26.600* :  being escorted to prison in the work colony.
*26:27.420- 26:29.120* :  Any day could be her last day.
*26:29.760- 26:32.600* :  That report was by Anastasia Zlatopolsky.
*26:34.140- 26:38.680* :  Local officials in Northern Ireland are considering whether to bring in specialist help
*26:38.820- 26:42.560* :  to identify the source of a mysterious night-time humming noise.
*26:43.180- 26:46.400* :  Some residents in the town of Oma in County Tyrone
*26:46.820- 26:48.720* :  have complained that the noise is keeping them awake.
*26:48.720- 26:52.900* :  And despite efforts, the reason for the persistent drone is still unknown.
*26:53.440- 26:55.840* :  Our island correspondent Chris Page reports from the town.
*26:56.620- 27:00.980* :  This time is a buzz, but it's not to do with conventional nightlife.
*27:01.500- 27:05.220* :  A few weeks ago, people began to notice a mysterious noise.
*27:06.120- 27:06.700* :  I've heard it.
*27:07.460- 27:07.820* :  What's it like?
*27:08.180- 27:08.720* :  Just that.
*27:10.500- 27:12.340* :  Being here, when you're laying in bed, they take.
*27:12.700- 27:15.320* :  It's like, um, by bed and noise, we're a load one at night,
*27:15.560- 27:16.960* :  but 12, one every night.
*27:18.360- 27:18.960* :  Is it keeping you awake?
*27:19.020- 27:20.980* :  Not really, no, but I did the first night.
*27:21.460- 27:22.380* :  It's already yesterday, no.
*27:23.220- 27:25.440* :  There were others who knew about the hum,
*27:26.000- 27:28.040* :  but haven't heard it with their own ears.
*27:28.740- 27:30.960* :  I haven't heard a thing, but I don't know where it's coming from.
*27:31.600- 27:32.380* :  Bit of a mystery, huh?
*27:32.580- 27:33.200* :  That is a mystery.
*27:33.540- 27:35.320* :  Does it cause a bit of talk or in the time?
*27:35.480- 27:37.120* :  Would there be something snoring beside you, maybe?
*27:38.360- 27:38.820* :  You never know.
*27:38.820- 27:39.540* :  You never know.
*27:40.040- 27:44.100* :  To say that's a nine and a lot of people, but never heard.
*27:44.140- 27:45.160* :  Maybe my hearing spot.
*27:47.040- 27:50.000* :  If you go until the metals,
*27:50.580- 27:51.660* :  I need to shout hello.
*27:52.260- 27:55.480* :  You'll hear it over the golf club because they're knackle.
*27:56.020- 27:57.880* :  Right, so they're knackle.
*27:58.020- 27:59.760* :  So there could be acoustics at play here?
*27:59.880- 28:00.260* :  I could.
*28:01.000- 28:05.000* :  Some theories about the source of the hum are that it's a factory,
*28:05.000- 28:07.900* :  farm machinery, or water infrastructure.
*28:08.580- 28:12.200* :  But from Anna and Duma Consul says the investigation is challenging,
*28:12.780- 28:16.120* :  partly because the noise is being heard over a wide area.
*28:16.720- 28:20.400* :  It's looking into using specialist equipment or an expert company
*28:20.840- 28:23.700* :  to try to solve the mystery and stop the sign.
*28:24.460- 28:28.280* :  For now, the Umahum is an unexplained phenomenon.
*28:29.100- 28:29.540* :  Chris Page.
*28:31.040- 28:33.020* :  I'm at all from us for now, but before we go,
*28:33.020- 28:36.080* :  I'd just like to tell you about a special podcast we're planning.
*28:36.080- 28:40.780* :  At the end of this month, world leaders are meeting at the UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai.
*28:40.860- 28:42.700* :  Do you have a question for them?
*28:43.180- 28:44.720* :  We would like to hear from you if you do.
*28:44.900- 28:47.460* :  No question on climate change is too big or too small.
*28:47.840- 28:53.040* :  Email us at the usual global podcast at bbc.co.uk.
*28:53.820- 28:54.780* :  We hope to hear from you soon.
*28:55.220- 28:59.660* :  You can also find us on ex formerly known as Twitter at global news pod.
*29:00.080- 29:03.440* :  This edition was mixed by Philip Bull and the producer was Phoebe Hobson.
*29:03.780- 29:05.040* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*29:05.260- 29:07.200* :  I'm Nick Miles and until next time, goodbye.
