*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:17.240* :  by advertising. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:18.980- 00:23.360* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Sunday, the 12th of November, these are our
*00:23.360- 00:29.280* :  main stories. Dr. Ingaza says the situation in the biggest hospital there is becoming desperate.
*00:29.760- 00:33.760* :  Shooting and bombardment everywhere you hear it at every second here around the
*00:33.760- 00:39.600* :  Shifa Hospital. No one can get out from the Shifa Hospital. No one can come to the Shifa Hospital.
*00:39.600- 00:45.480* :  The situation is very very dangerous. The Israelis say they'll help with the evacuation of babies
*00:45.480- 00:53.580* :  to a safer hospital on Sunday. In London, some 300,000 people took part in a pro-Palestine march.
*00:56.120- 01:02.020* :  Also in this podcast, thousands are evacuated as tremors indicate an imminent volcanic eruption
*01:02.020- 01:09.400* :  in Iceland and... You had options of oysters, salmon, beef, I'm his good one, squab,
*01:09.400- 01:15.160* :  alagadard, that's pigeon, you had lamb, you had chicken, you had multiple, multiple courses.
*01:15.660- 01:22.220* :  Stay tuned to find out why someone was prepared to splash out more than $100,000 not on the meal,
*01:22.220- 01:30.680* :  but on the menu card. In Gaza, doctors at the largest hospital there,
*01:30.680- 01:36.880* :  al-Shifa say many patients, including premature babies, are at risk of dying, not because of
*01:36.880- 01:42.460* :  disease but because of a lack of power. While doctors describe the scene as a war zone.
*01:42.620- 01:49.180* :  His colleague, al-Shifa's senior surgeon, Marwan Abbasada, told the BBC it was becoming impossible
*01:49.660- 01:54.560* :  to operate. Shooting and bombardment everywhere, you hear it at every seconds around the Shifa
*01:54.560- 01:59.800* :  Hospital and no one can get out from the Shifa Hospital, no one can come to the Shifa Hospital.
*01:59.800- 02:05.120* :  Situation is very, very dangerous, there is no water even in the main building, no electricity,
*02:05.120- 02:11.100* :  no food even and no fuel. The Israeli military says Hamas has built its command centre
*02:11.100- 02:17.460* :  underneath the hospital, something denied by Hamas and by medical staff. Thousands of
*02:17.460- 02:21.960* :  Palestinians who'd sought safety next to the hospital have been fleeing to the south of the
*02:21.960- 02:27.340* :  territory. A reporter in Gaza, Brashti Abu Alouf, watched them arrive at refugee camps.
*02:27.660- 02:32.600* :  More than 2-3,000 people already flee from the north and they arrived here in Hanyunis.
*02:32.880- 02:37.780* :  They were coming from Shifa Hospital, they said the situation remained very tense around the
*02:37.780- 02:43.300* :  hospital, with the tanks getting closer and closer to the gate of the hospital. Now very few
*02:43.300- 02:48.600* :  people, like 5-6 people, they managed to escape under fire from the hospital this morning,
*02:48.600- 02:54.500* :  but they told me about 10,000 people are remain in the courtyard of the hospital, no electricity
*02:54.500- 02:59.640* :  there. Most of the operation are suspended, including the intensive care unit in the hospital.
*02:59.640- 03:04.680* :  I managed to call a journalist who may be the last one who is there and he described what is
*03:04.680- 03:09.580* :  going on around the hospital as a real war. This is the biggest medical centre. The biggest
*03:09.580- 03:14.620* :  kidney dialysis department is in this hospital. The biggest surgery is in this hospital.
*03:14.620- 03:20.600* :  Today about a hundred body were buried in the car park of the hospital because they said they
*03:20.600- 03:25.360* :  were unable to move them to the cemetery and they have no space in the mosque. They said they
*03:25.360- 03:30.820* :  were killed from an aerostrike in a school. Yesterday, a nearby shot air refugee camp closed
*03:30.860- 03:34.780* :  to the hospital so they were buried in a mass grave in the car park of the hospital.
*03:35.480- 03:41.720* :  Russia, Abu al-Uf in Khan Yunus. For Israel's part, it maintains it's doing all it can to
*03:41.720- 03:47.480* :  avoid civilian casualties and it said it will help evacuate babies from the al-Shifa hospital
*03:47.480- 03:54.020* :  to a safer hospital on Sunday. Dania Hagari of the IDF blamed her mass for the plight of
*03:54.020- 04:02.300* :  Gaza's residents. Hundreds of thousands of Gaza's residents have already moved south and Hamas is
*04:02.300- 04:07.840* :  doing everything in its power to prevent them from doing so. Hamas uses civilians as human shields.
*04:07.840- 04:13.660* :  It is ready to endanger the lives of children of Gaza to protect itself. It has no limits.
*04:14.380- 04:19.420* :  A correspondent in Jerusalem, Paul Adams, told me more about what the Israelis had to say.
*04:20.120- 04:24.980* :  They insist that they are not targeting hospitals. Despite everything that we've been hearing
*04:24.980- 04:31.400* :  throughout the day from numerous medical sources, the Israelis say yes, there is heavy fighting
*04:31.400- 04:36.500* :  in the vicinity of these hospitals, but that the Israelis are not themselves targeting the
*04:36.500- 04:41.500* :  hospitals. They're very emphatic about that. And in fact, in the case of Shifa, they say that
*04:41.500- 04:47.900* :  it is not even under siege, that they have kept one side of the hospital on the eastern side of
*04:47.900- 04:53.740* :  the hospital open so that people who want to leave can leave along one of the Gaza's main streets
*04:53.740- 04:59.200* :  and rejoin the route that takes people away from Gaza City and down towards the southern end
*04:59.520- 05:04.960* :  of the Gaza Strip. So the Israeli argument is, look, these places are being used by Hamas.
*05:05.080- 05:10.940* :  We have to deal with that, but we do not want civilians caught up in the middle and they are going
*05:10.940- 05:15.440* :  to some lengths to try and persuade people to leave rather than just attack the hospitals
*05:15.960- 05:21.400* :  in their current state. And what about the military pauses that we understand have been
*05:21.400- 05:27.000* :  agreed with the Israelis? In a way, they're not really agreed. They're just unilateral. The Israelis
*05:27.000- 05:33.160* :  are saying, we will keep these routes open and what they are saying to the population from day
*05:33.160- 05:39.040* :  to day is, if you are in, for example, Jabbalia today, then you will be able to go out along this
*05:39.040- 05:44.680* :  route and head south. And those orders are coming every day. They are for several hours. The
*05:44.680- 05:49.920* :  purpose is only about evacuating civilians and judging by the numbers who have left in the past
*05:50.280- 05:55.520* :  few days, 150,000 or more, it seems to be a tactic that's working for Israel.
*05:56.280- 06:01.300* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. The leaders of 57 Arab and Muslim countries
*06:01.300- 06:07.180* :  have ended an emergency summit in Saudi Arabia by condemning Israel's military action in Gaza
*06:07.180- 06:12.680* :  as well as its western backers. But the meeting failed to produce concrete punitive measures
*06:12.680- 06:18.100* :  which some of the countries attending had called for. Our security correspondent Frank Gardner is in
*06:19.200- 06:24.220* :  pretty much everybody from 57 Islamic nations, including all the Arab League countries.
*06:24.760- 06:29.040* :  And that includes some pretty strange bedfellows. This is Saudi Arabia, and yet it's
*06:29.520- 06:36.040* :  historic rival in this region, Iran, sent its president, Ibrahim Maraisi. And really,
*06:36.040- 06:41.440* :  this was a kind of tale of two halves. You had some countries such as Iran, Syria, Algeria,
*06:41.840- 06:48.700* :  pushing for really concrete punitive measures to not so much punish Israel, but to punish Israel's
*06:48.700- 06:54.440* :  backers, primarily the United States. Some people were calling for closure of US bases in the region
*06:54.440- 07:00.780* :  for an end to the overflight rights of Israel over Arab countries for a severing of relations
*07:00.780- 07:06.880* :  of diplomatic relations in Israel and countries like Bahrain, UAE. All of that was refused.
*07:06.940- 07:13.620* :  But what they have had is a really resounding condemnation, not only of Israel's actions in Gaza,
*07:14.140- 07:19.700* :  those who give it the green light, their words. And I would say that this summit isn't so much
*07:19.700- 07:24.420* :  aimed at Israel, it's aimed at the United States. And there have been a lot of accusations
*07:24.420- 07:29.600* :  that double standards saying, look, the West has been very quick to condemn Russia for its killing
*07:29.600- 07:35.520* :  of civilians in Ukraine, but has been pretty muted about what's going on in Gaza.
*07:36.320- 07:42.620* :  Frank Gardner in Riyadh. Here in London, police say more than 300,000 protesters took part in a
*07:42.620- 07:47.960* :  pro-Palestinian march. It was one of the biggest demonstrations of its type in recent years.
*07:47.980- 07:54.400* :  About 2000 police were deployed on the capital streets. The march went ahead despite days of
*07:54.400- 08:00.600* :  highly charged political debate with the British Home Secretary, Suela Bravaman, labelling pro-Palestinian
*08:00.600- 08:06.280* :  rallies as hate marches. The march coincided with the Armistice Day, which commemorates the
*08:06.280- 08:11.920* :  end of the First World War. BBC's Home Affairs Editor Mark Houston spent the day with police
*08:12.380- 08:18.960* :  and protesters. With a group of great Palestinian protesters now waving their flags and holding
*08:18.960- 08:26.440* :  up their placards, one interestingly reads Armistice equals ceasefire and has a big red poppy on it.
*08:29.100- 08:33.340* :  Hi, my name is Professor Kamil Hawash, I'm the chair of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign.
*08:34.340- 08:38.500* :  And I noticed you're wearing a poppy. It's an important day to remember those who died,
*08:38.500- 08:43.640* :  but amongst them were 10,000 Palestinians who joined the British Army. So it's not a uniquely
*08:44.780- 08:48.100* :  British remembrance. It brings all of that together.
*08:50.920- 08:57.300* :  The march has now begun here in Park Lane by Hyde Park, and it's all very peaceful families and
*08:57.300- 09:03.260* :  babies in pushjairs and dogs. But the Metropolitan Police say that there has been some disturbance
*09:03.260- 09:07.740* :  elsewhere. They just issued a statement saying that while the two-minute silence was marked
*09:07.740- 09:12.820* :  respectfully and without incident, there has been aggression from counter-protesters who are
*09:12.820- 09:17.420* :  in the area in significant numbers. Different groups moving away from Whitehall
*09:17.600- 09:21.160* :  towards other parts of Central London and officers are trying to keep track of them.
*09:27.960- 09:34.300* :  And just outside the Metropolitan Police Control Room in Lambeth, just south of the river,
*09:34.840- 09:40.160* :  a whole cavalcade of police vehicles have now just headed up towards Voxhall Bridge where
*09:40.400- 09:46.100* :  we understand there has been a clash between far-right protesters and some of those who'd come
*09:46.100- 09:53.320* :  to take part in the pro-Palestinian march. Police say they've arrested around 90 counter-protesters,
*09:53.320- 09:58.720* :  and many of those have got previous convictions for football hooliganism. They've also arrested
*09:58.720- 10:03.580* :  around a dozen pro-Palestinian demonstrators allegedly making anti-Semitic chance or
*10:03.580- 10:08.720* :  showing support for Hamas, a prescribed terrorist group. But with the main march now dispersing,
*10:08.720- 10:13.320* :  Scotland Yards say they've successfully managed both to protect people's right to protest
*10:13.920- 10:15.960* :  and the sanctity of Armistice Day.
*10:17.040- 10:22.320* :  Mark Houston. President Velodomir Zelensky has marked the first anniversary of the liberation
*10:22.320- 10:27.540* :  of her son from Russian occupiers by praising the city's residence for his he-put-it,
*10:28.180- 10:33.020* :  inspiring the world with their resistance. It comes amid fears expressed by some in Ukraine
*10:33.020- 10:37.700* :  that the conflict against invading Russian forces has reached a stalemate,
*10:38.060- 10:42.840* :  a description that Mr. Zelensky rejects. Our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Erberhard,
*10:42.840- 10:48.500* :  has this assessment. Ukraine is facing a very different picture going into this winter than the
*10:48.500- 10:53.340* :  last one. Its energy infrastructure is not yet being attacked with the same intensity,
*10:53.420- 10:59.580* :  but on the territorial front the picture is more sobering. Last autumn Ukrainian troops had
*10:59.580- 11:04.940* :  recaptured swathes of the Northeastern Harkiv region and lands west of the River Deneepro.
*11:05.500- 11:10.300* :  Now, they've made few gains in a grueling counteroffensive that's already lasted over five
*11:10.300- 11:15.620* :  months and their underpressure in the east. All this is set against a backdrop of many experts
*11:15.620- 11:20.840* :  appraisal that's a long-war favours Russia. President Zelensky is seizing on the
*11:20.840- 11:26.260* :  Kherson anniversary to boost morale, evoking the emotions unleashed by the city's liberation.
*11:26.940- 11:33.100* :  The message it symbolises according to him, when unity prevails, Ukraine always returns to occupied
*11:37.680- 11:45.000* :  lands. The entire south of Ukraine learned last year that Russia never comes forever, no matter
*11:45.000- 11:51.760* :  how many times they repeat it, because Ukraine always returns. When we know our goal,
*11:51.760- 11:59.160* :  when we are in unity, today is one of the anniversaries that shape our Ukrainian confidence
*11:59.260- 12:06.340* :  that we can. In essence, Mr. Zelensky was urging citizens in occupied or unoccupied parts of
*12:06.340- 12:12.640* :  Ukraine, soldiers on the front lines, and also allies to keep faith. Danny Eberhard.
*12:13.680- 12:20.120* :  The Titanic sank 111 years ago, but there is still great fascination with anything connected
*12:20.120- 12:27.100* :  to the luxury liner, including it seems, what people ate on board. On Saturday, a very rare item,
*12:27.100- 12:34.520* :  a menu from the ship, fetched more than $100,000. It stated, April 11, three days before
*12:34.520- 12:39.620* :  the ship struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic, leading to the loss of 1,500 lives.
*12:40.400- 12:45.000* :  Andrew Aldridge is the managing director of the English Auction House that organised the sale,
*12:45.440- 12:48.720* :  and James Kummer Asami asked him what was on the menu that night.
*12:49.580- 12:54.780* :  Let's put it this way, they didn't go hungry. It was fairly opulent fare, as you would expect,
*12:54.780- 13:01.440* :  with a first-class menu on the Titanic. You had options of oysters, salmon, beef,
*13:01.440- 13:08.080* :  and his good ones, squab, alagodard, that's pigeon, you had lamb, you had chicken, you had multiple,
*13:08.080- 13:15.360* :  multiple courses, and how was this menu preserved? I was approached earlier in the year by a couple
*13:15.360- 13:21.340* :  in Canada, and they were going through their father's possessions, he passed a few years before,
*13:22.040- 13:25.500* :  and they were going through various albums of photographs and letters, etc.
*13:26.060- 13:29.560* :  And they opened up a page and this menu is staring out at them. 48 hours later,
*13:29.560- 13:34.720* :  I opened the package and I was like, oh, OMG, this is the real deal. Completely unique menu.
*13:34.900- 13:42.140* :  Ironically, there are more April 14 menus than other menus, and the simple answer to that
*13:42.420- 13:47.520* :  is, you hit the bird late on April 14, gentlemen were dressed in their smart suits,
*13:48.080- 13:52.440* :  having their dinner, and it happens today on a liner that you have a very nice dinner.
*13:52.440- 13:56.620* :  You'll take the menus of souvenir. You get back to your cabin, the ship hits the bird,
*13:57.120- 14:01.080* :  you get on deck, it's cold, you give your wife your dinner jacket because you want to kick
*14:01.080- 14:06.300* :  them warm, they'll get in a lifeboat, they're saved, they get to New York, they open the jacket,
*14:06.300- 14:10.560* :  feel inside, and there's a menu. What do you say to people who might wonder whether there's
*14:10.560- 14:15.780* :  something a little bit lurid about collecting items from people who died in this way?
*14:16.240- 14:22.060* :  These particular items, we're talking about these men 111 years afterwards. We got a watch in
*14:22.060- 14:28.220* :  this cell. Gentleman could sign a can tour. He was a Belarusian and he was traveling to the US
*14:28.220- 14:34.520* :  to study medicine with his wife. He drowned, she lived, his watch went back to his wife,
*14:34.780- 14:39.400* :  her descendants sold it about 10 years ago. Through that piece of memorabilia, that man's memory
*14:39.400- 14:43.980* :  has kept alive. You know, we're still talking about these people 111 years later, and that's why
*14:43.980- 14:47.500* :  people are interested in these objects. You know, it's a question I'm asked all the time by the
*14:47.500- 14:52.060* :  media. Why are people still talking about this 111 years later? There's still the story to
*14:52.060- 14:56.460* :  its basic essence. It's a large liner, hits an iceberg, sinks with a horrific loss of life.
*14:56.760- 15:02.800* :  But where the interest of this lies is you've got 2,200 plus people on that ship, every man,
*15:02.800- 15:07.940* :  woman, and child on that ship has a story to tell. Those stories in many ways are told through
*15:07.940- 15:13.060* :  this memorabilia, and that's why we're still talking about it. Andrew Aldridge, speaking to James
*15:13.060- 15:17.960* :  Kummer-Sami. Still to come on the Global News podcast.
*15:17.960- 15:23.940* :  We're all the people, back on earth, they throw up all the way, have a message that we would like
*15:23.960- 15:30.220* :  to send you. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was about formed.
*15:30.880- 15:38.020* :  Remembering the astronaut Frank Bourman, who led the first-ever moon mission and has died at the age of 95.
*15:42.780- 15:50.240* :  Suddenly my quilt is ripped off me, and my room is full of white men, and I thought I'm done for.
*15:50.380- 15:54.940* :  These are fascists, they found where I live. Life's less ordinary is the podcast from the BBC

*16:07.620- 16:13.240* :  crossed the river Nile in the capital, Khartoum, has been destroyed. The Sudanese army and rival
*16:13.240- 16:19.280* :  paramilitary group, the RSF, blame each other for the destruction. A senior United Nations official
*16:19.280- 16:26.000* :  says the violence being waged against civilians is verging on pure evil. Dr Abu Bakr Bakr,
*16:26.000- 16:31.900* :  is head of operations for Sudan for the medical charity MSF. He's based in Nairobi,
*16:31.900- 16:39.300* :  but his colleagues working inside Sudan. If there is no immediate actions taken now by allowing
*16:39.300- 16:45.880* :  the humanitarian assistance, especially in Darfur and inside Khartoum, we'll definitely see a
*16:45.880- 16:49.920* :  total collapse and shutdown of the health system anytime. Inside Khartoum and in Darfur,
*16:49.920- 16:54.700* :  bullets are flying everywhere. There is no safe place at all. People are in continuous displacement.
*16:54.700- 17:01.140* :  It's a daily struggle for everyone there. Dr Abu Bakr Bakr, our Africa Regional Editor Richard
*17:01.140- 17:06.460* :  Hamilton has been following the latest developments on the ground. The Shambat Bridge was blown
*17:06.460- 17:12.980* :  up at dawn. There was a massive explosion. If you look at a map, it's on the bottle net of the Nile
*17:13.240- 17:19.160* :  before it splits into two, the blue Nile and the white Nile. It was really connecting the three
*17:19.160- 17:25.580* :  separate parts of Greater Khartoum and its destruction is probably more disadvantageous to the
*17:25.740- 17:30.800* :  paramilitary, the RSF because it was the only bridge that they controlled, so now they can't
*17:30.800- 17:35.180* :  move their troops around. And what does it mean for residents, people living there?
*17:35.440- 17:41.520* :  Yes, so the other three bridges across the white Nile are all contested between the army and the RSF,
*17:41.540- 17:46.340* :  so it was the only bridge that the civilians could use to get across from one side to the other.
*17:46.640- 17:52.100* :  So it now means that some families are divided and stranded on separate sides of the Nile.
*17:52.220- 17:57.420* :  And of course, also this will add to the massive costs of eventual reconstruction that the
*17:57.420- 18:02.760* :  damages estimated as hundreds of billions of dollars. Now it's nearly seven months since the
*18:02.760- 18:10.380* :  conflict in Sudan started. Where are we now in this? So it's raging on despite the resumption
*18:10.380- 18:16.320* :  of peace talks in Jeddah and Saudi Arabia, it seems that the RSF was getting the upper hand.
*18:16.320- 18:22.800* :  They've committed widespread war crimes and human rights abuses in Darfur and analysts say
*18:22.800- 18:28.220* :  that Sudan is moving towards what's happened in Libya where you end up getting two rival
*18:28.260- 18:34.700* :  governments. So you may have the RSF taking control of Khartoum and Darfur and the army being
*18:34.700- 18:41.000* :  based in Port Sudan and so far around 10,000 people have died and nearly six million displaced.
*18:41.000- 18:47.340* :  Richard Hamilton, more than 3,000 people are facing a second night in temporary accommodation
*18:47.340- 18:52.940* :  in southwestern Iceland where a major volcanic eruption could occur at any moment.
*18:53.580- 18:59.040* :  Measurements show an underground lava flow almost 10 kilometers long is building up in the area.
*18:59.040- 19:04.420* :  The head of Iceland's civil defense video-renison warned residents not to return.
*19:06.940- 19:12.580* :  The situation now is that the area is closed to everyone so it is not permitted to go there to
*19:12.580- 19:17.140* :  save valuables and check on houses. We do not know how long this situation will last
*19:17.140- 19:21.840* :  but will keep you informed as soon as there are any changes. Be prepared for this to last for
*19:21.860- 19:25.420* :  quite some time. Here's more from our reporter, Mr. Pika.
*19:28.840- 19:32.540* :  The warning signs had been there for weeks. Thousands of earthquakes had been shaking the
*19:32.540- 19:40.540* :  region as peninsula. The tremors are caused by a huge magma flow. An underground river
*19:40.540- 19:46.020* :  of molten rock five miles long that runs from the inland mountains to the coastal town of Khrintavik.
*19:46.520- 19:51.820* :  Overnight the quakes became stronger and more frequent and more focused on the area around the town
*19:51.820- 19:58.560* :  where an evacuation was ordered at midnight. The operation passed smoothly, all 3,300 inhabitants
*19:58.560- 20:03.680* :  were with family and friends or in temporary accommodation within hours. But it may be sometime
*20:03.680- 20:09.180* :  before they can return home. There are no signs of the magma flow getting weaker and as long as
*20:09.180- 20:13.420* :  that remains the case, the danger of a destructive eruption in the town persists.
*20:14.020- 20:21.520* :  Mr. Pika, back now to our top story, the conflict in Gaza. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*20:21.520- 20:27.240* :  in a television address on Saturday said Israeli forces had killed thousands of Hamas terrorists
*20:27.240- 20:34.080* :  near the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. He said Hamas is an integral part of the Iranian Axis
*20:34.080- 20:44.400* :  of Evil and he vowed that the fight would continue. The war against Hamas ISIS is going for force
*20:44.400- 20:52.880* :  and it has one objective to win. There is nothing other than a victory. We will eradicate Hamas
*20:52.880- 20:59.120* :  and we will bring back our hostages. The words of Benjamin Netanyahu through an interpreter.
*20:59.920- 21:06.600* :  The BBC has been following the lives of 5 people inside Gaza as they face almost daily bombardment.
*21:07.180- 21:10.780* :  Today we hear the experience of 27-year-old vlogger Ayat.
*21:14.080- 21:19.240* :  We have no bread at home. My brother went to the bakery but it was packed. The queue was
*21:19.240- 21:26.360* :  six hours long but we have a neighbor who has a mud oven and bakes for everyone in the neighborhood.
*21:27.020- 21:32.200* :  So we decided to make the dough at home and then he would bake it for us because there's no gas
*21:32.200- 21:41.460* :  or electricity to use. The situation is tragic. We used to live a beautiful life, a normal life,
*21:42.120- 21:49.060* :  a life full of creativity and ideas of dreams and ambition but now the Israeli occupation
*21:49.520- 21:53.180* :  has destroyed everything. It has killed everything inside of us.
*21:55.800- 22:02.320* :  To fill up this gallon bottle of drinking water, my brother saw hell. He woke more than six kilometers
*22:02.820- 22:07.720* :  and stood in a line and waited. Hours later he found and he managed to fill it up.
*22:11.940- 22:17.340* :  This is the sound of the drones, the buzzing surveillance planes and the skies above Gaza
*22:18.240- 22:24.940* :  and there are many of them across the sky. This is the night in Gaza.
*22:25.920- 22:32.200* :  Fire on the horizon, constant bombing, the sound of the buzzing drones do not stop.
*22:33.740- 22:35.820* :  Missiles everywhere, nowhere safe.
*22:35.820- 22:40.980* :  All of us in Gaza are martyrs waiting to be killed.
*22:51.240- 22:56.340* :  Every day there's a bombing in Gaza. They bombed everything. They bombed the mosques, the schools,
*22:56.340- 23:01.720* :  the churches and the hospitals. They bombed their residential towers and buildings.
*23:02.880- 23:09.400* :  They bombed homes of civilians. We are people full of life of ambition and creativity and
*23:09.400- 23:15.240* :  positive ideas. We like change and we want to develop our community to become leading and
*23:15.240- 23:22.000* :  active figures of society. We love build and grow but unfortunately the occupation is killing
*23:22.000- 23:29.080* :  everything, destroying everything. They don't have mercy. We wish this nightmare to end.
*23:30.720- 23:37.320* :  Vlogger Iat in Gaza. On Friday on the Global News podcast, we heard present Emanuel Macron
*23:37.320- 23:42.800* :  of France in an interview with the BBC calling on Israel to stop bombing babies, women,
*23:42.800- 23:48.480* :  the elderly and civilians. Mr. Macron said there was no reason for it and stated there should be
*23:48.480- 23:55.000* :  an immediate ceasefire. But President Macron is also concerned about Ukraine as he told our
*23:55.000- 24:00.800* :  European editor Katya Adler. Let's imagine we stop helping Ukraine. Probably they will be
*24:00.800- 24:06.060* :  defeated. For Europeans it means there is no more serious an architect of security in this
*24:06.100- 24:11.360* :  continent because you will have a new imperial power because definitely it's imperialism
*24:11.700- 24:17.460* :  and colonialism that Russia is doing. So you have a new imperial power having defeated a big
*24:17.460- 24:23.320* :  country with a 40 million inhabitants close to your door. So I think there is no better option
*24:23.320- 24:30.500* :  than helping Ukraine to resist, to put itself in a situation to have fair and good negotiations
*24:31.320- 24:36.720* :  and to come back at the table and find a solution with Russia but in a situation where they
*24:36.720- 24:42.100* :  defend both the territory and the security. So not yet? I think it's not yet the case. I'm not
*24:42.100- 24:46.280* :  the one to decide the right moment. This is the two parties being on the ground. But this is
*24:46.280- 24:52.660* :  the Ukrainians decide any type of negotiation. But I think our duty is to help Ukraine to
*24:52.660- 24:59.160* :  remain committed and in parallel to progress on NATO and EU time. The United States has been
*24:59.160- 25:05.100* :  key for supporting Ukraine alongside Europe. But we don't know who is going to end up in the
*25:05.100- 25:11.660* :  White House next year after presidential elections. Can Europe go alone? We are very lucky with
*25:11.660- 25:17.040* :  to have such an administration in the US. Let's be clear. Because they are committed and they
*25:17.040- 25:22.720* :  have a very reasonable diplomacy. Meaning helping this democracy to protect its territory,
*25:22.720- 25:29.940* :  meaning Ukraine, without creating any escalation. Second, I don't make any bets on US domestic
*25:29.940- 25:36.420* :  policies. I want to believe it should be a bipartisan consensus because it clearly what is at stake
*25:36.420- 25:42.700* :  is, as well, UN chartered principles, territory and integrity and sovereignty. Third, I think
*25:42.700- 25:49.080* :  the Europeans have to inculcly endorse their role. We speak about our direct neighborhood and
*25:49.080- 25:54.320* :  this is our duty to be more and more engaged. Are you concerned that things feel more and more
*25:54.320- 25:59.560* :  polarized? I mean, whether it's over Israel-Garza, whether it's over Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
*25:59.560- 26:04.300* :  or when it comes to a subject very close to your heart which is climate change? Globally,
*26:04.820- 26:09.040* :  we have more and more polarization. For quite simple reason, people are over-informed,
*26:09.040- 26:16.060* :  but through social networks and there's a lot of platforms. Argument is less powerful than
*26:16.060- 26:22.100* :  emotion and negative emotion is more powerful than positive emotion. If you have such a marital
*26:22.100- 26:27.820* :  order, which is exactly the one who creates a lot of traffic and reactions, people are over-detainting
*26:27.820- 26:33.360* :  by the negative emotions they feel. So this is why we have a big issue now on migration
*26:34.040- 26:41.700* :  and big polarization on migration, geopolitics, climate, etc. etc. The big risk is that it creates
*26:41.700- 26:47.320* :  a pressure on leaders and more and more, leaders follow the people, follow this reaction,
*26:48.180- 26:52.960* :  and in a certain way, probably creates new divisions in this world.
*26:53.440- 26:59.920* :  The French President Emmanuel Macron speaking to Katya Adler. And finally, over the Christmas period
*26:59.920- 27:07.160* :  back in 1968, three NASA astronauts became the first people to orbit the moon. One of them
*27:07.160- 27:13.320* :  was Frank Bourbon, who's now died at the age of 95 at his home in Montana in the United States.
*27:13.960- 27:19.300* :  He commanded the mission that started an extraordinary phase in spaceflight and exploration,
*27:19.300- 27:24.620* :  and he took part in one of its landmark moments. The historian and author Robert Curson,
*27:24.620- 27:29.100* :  who knew Frank Bourbon well, has been talking to us about Frank's life and work,
*27:29.100- 27:37.320* :  and why he wanted to go into space. Frank wasn't interested in going into space to expand mankind's
*27:37.320- 27:42.300* :  horizons or to pick up space rocks. He was in it for one reason and one reason only, and that was
*27:42.300- 27:48.740* :  to defeat the Soviet Union. I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal
*27:49.600- 27:55.300* :  before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.
*27:55.300- 28:02.540* :  No single space project. Apollo 8 occurred suddenly as a result of a secret memo obtained by
*28:02.540- 28:08.320* :  American intelligence that indicated that the Soviet Union was ready to fly men around the moon
*28:08.320- 28:14.800* :  by the end of 1968. Frank Bourbon was called suddenly to Houston for an emergency and highly,
*28:14.800- 28:18.920* :  highly secret meeting where they told him, Frank, we want you to go to the moon.
*28:19.120- 28:25.020* :  I got a call from Houston, Dixlatan, my boss. I walked in his office. He told me that the CIA had
*28:25.020- 28:30.660* :  recently determined that the Russians were planning a circumlunar flight before the end of the year,
*28:30.980- 28:38.380* :  and that the powers that be in NASA decided to make Apollo 8 a circumlunar flight and go without
*28:38.380- 28:42.200* :  a lamb to the moon. And I said, yes, let's go. That's what we're here for.
*28:42.520- 28:46.260* :  This morning, three Americans, Frank Bourbon, Jim Lovell and William Anders are on the verge
*28:46.260- 28:50.780* :  of making man's first journey to the moon. We have to remember that they were riding the Saturn
*28:50.780- 28:57.060* :  5 rocket, which remains to this day in 2023, the most powerful machine ever built.
*28:57.060- 29:05.120* :  The engines are on. Four, three, two, one, zero. We have, we have.
*29:05.920- 29:10.740* :  They first made an earth orbit. Everything was going well and then they launched toward the moon.
*29:10.740- 29:16.580* :  But on the way, Frank Bourbon got very ill. This is Apollo controlled. Houston, we've learned
*29:16.580- 29:22.020* :  that there is a little nausea aboard Frank Bourbon. And there was a very serious meeting
*29:22.020- 29:26.980* :  among the heads of NASA, debating about whether to call this flight back. But when you ask Frank
*29:26.980- 29:32.160* :  about it, he would always say we would have had radio failure. So Frank and his crew were not
*29:32.160- 29:35.600* :  intending to come back from mankind's first-ever journey to the moon.
*29:42.300- 29:47.380* :  When Frank was informed that they were going to do broadcasts live back to earth, he didn't seem
*29:47.380- 29:53.000* :  to want very much to do with that. This Apollo 8 flight and my mind was designed to beat the
*29:53.000- 29:57.400* :  Russians to the moon. And anything that would not contribute to that, I was against.
*29:58.140- 30:00.700* :  NASA told me I was wrong and overruled me and they were right.
*30:06.220- 30:10.700* :  They had plans to take pictures because part of this mission was to prepare for the Apollo
*30:10.700- 30:14.980* :  11 landing. But nobody told them what to expect. And when they finally got there,
*30:14.980- 30:21.460* :  all three of them were totally speechless and wide-eyed. Bill Anders, the youngest of the
*30:21.460- 30:27.560* :  three-man crew, shot what would probably become the most famous photograph ever taken.
*30:27.560- 30:33.200* :  It's known today as Earthrise. And it's something that Apollo 8 will be known for forever, I think.
*30:33.400- 30:38.580* :  It was Christmas. There in the far distance was our home. That was the only thing in space
*30:38.580- 30:44.660* :  that had any color. It was basically blue. You can see the white clouds and the kind of brownish
*30:44.660- 30:51.040* :  pink planet. It was a beautiful view. From the first minutes that I spent with him, he was the
*30:51.040- 30:57.440* :  nicest, smartest, funniest and often warmest person I dealt with in many, many years.
*30:58.340- 31:03.060* :  We're at a rental price and now we're paying you as Americans to help them make it possible.
*31:03.060- 31:03.940* :  Thanks for having me.
*31:04.280- 31:09.160* :  Frank Bowman will be remembered for many things. But one of the things he'll be most remembered for
*31:09.160- 31:13.700* :  is the reading from the Book of Genesis. A third of the world's population is tuned in.
*31:13.740- 31:18.660* :  From all across the world, people are hanging on the words of these three men who on Christmas Eve
*31:18.880- 31:24.140* :  have reached the moon. But nobody has any idea what the astronauts are going to say.
*31:24.440- 31:30.420* :  We're now approaching Russia's sunrise and for all the people back on Earth,
*31:30.780- 31:35.700* :  we prove Apollo 8 has a message that we would like to send you in the beginning.
*31:35.700- 31:40.480* :  God created the heaven in the earth. And the earth will be about form.
*31:40.940- 31:47.740* :  And it is Frank who begins by saying in the beginning, and it is also Frank who says goodbye
*31:47.740- 31:53.960* :  to everyone just moments before the radio signal and television signal from the moon goes dark.
*31:54.040- 32:01.100* :  And it's Frank who speaks the final moving and stirring words that I think he'll be remembered for forever.
*32:14.220- 32:18.220* :  The voice of Frank Bowman remembered there by Robert Curson.
*32:20.220- 32:24.380* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*32:24.920- 32:30.520* :  This edition was mixed by Jack Graysmark, the producer was Emma Joseph, the editor is Karen Martin.
*32:31.040- 32:33.060* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and until next time, bye.
