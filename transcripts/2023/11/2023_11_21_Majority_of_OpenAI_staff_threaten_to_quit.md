*01:54.140- 01:58.900* :  Another hospital in Gaza has become caught up in the fighting with 12 people reported killed.
*01:59.660- 02:04.960* :  And the UN says the world is on course for a catastrophic warming, even if countries meet their
*02:04.960- 02:12.740* :  current pledges to cut emissions. Also in the podcast, Argentina's next president promises
*02:12.740- 02:18.400* :  radical change, but can he deliver? And just when you thought the Toronto rental market
*02:18.400- 02:25.580* :  couldn't get any worse, it did. I present to you shared bedroom in a lake facing downtown condo
*02:25.580- 02:31.620* :  for $900 a month. The growth of bed sharing as a solution to rising rents.
*02:36.560- 02:40.980* :  Much has been made of the potential of artificial intelligence to disrupt everything from
*02:40.980- 02:48.020* :  healthcare to banking to politics. But the recent chaos at OpenAI, the firm behind chat GPT,
*02:48.020- 02:53.980* :  has a very human face. First came the shock sacking of co-founder Sam Altman on Friday.
*02:53.980- 02:58.960* :  Then there were reports the firm was under pressure from investors like Microsoft to take him back.
*02:59.500- 03:04.200* :  Instead, it was announced that Sam Altman and his open AI co-founder Greg Brockman
*03:04.600- 03:13.760* :  would be joining Microsoft itself. Now we know that 735 of the 770 staff at OpenAI have signed a
*03:13.760- 03:19.820* :  letter threatening to resign. Matt Schlicht is CEO of Octane AI and a friend of Sam Altman.
*03:20.240- 03:25.980* :  I think that the majority of these people will quit. They love Sam. They love Greg. This is a family.
*03:25.980- 03:30.880* :  They have created something nobody has ever created before. This is not a normal tech company.
*03:30.880- 03:36.320* :  This is an advancement for all of humanity no matter how you want to look at it.
*03:36.500- 03:40.380* :  So where did it all go wrong? The BBC's James Clayton is in San Francisco.
*03:40.880- 03:46.060* :  OpenAI started off as a not-for-profit. They did not want to produce anything or be
*03:46.060- 03:53.560* :  beholden to their shareholders. They wanted to create AI for the good of humanity. But what OpenAI
*03:53.560- 03:59.840* :  really needed was a lot of cloud computing. So in 2019, they put out a press release to say that
*03:59.840- 04:04.360* :  to try and get access to this cloud computing, they would need a lot of investment. So they would
*04:04.360- 04:13.200* :  produce a hybrid company, a full-profit part and a not-for-profit part. But it was a partnership
*04:13.200- 04:20.680* :  not of equals. So the not-for-profit would govern the full-profit bit of the company. And that's why
*04:20.680- 04:27.060* :  you have this bizarre structure where you have Microsoft that is a huge investor in OpenAI that
*04:27.060- 04:31.900* :  doesn't have a board seat. And you also have this bizarre situation that the not-for-profits
*04:31.900- 04:37.840* :  board looks much more like a not-for-profits board. You have people that with very, very limited
*04:37.840- 04:45.940* :  board experience. Plus, you only have six members of the board. So it only took four people to make
*04:45.940- 04:53.640* :  this incredibly potentially damaging move to remove Sam Altman. All of this stems from OpenAI's
*04:53.640- 05:00.260* :  very curious governance structure. But there has been a catastrophic falling out at the top there.
*05:00.440- 05:04.720* :  And there's some suggestions. It was over differences over how fast the company was going.
*05:04.960- 05:10.900* :  Exactly. And that appears to be a key division right at the top. So you have Greg Brockman,
*05:10.900- 05:18.620* :  co-founder, Sam Altman. And then you have this key person, Ilya Stetskiver. He's this AI wonder kid.
*05:18.620- 05:25.880* :  He went to OpenAI. He's the chief scientist. He's incredibly influential. He appears to be
*05:25.980- 05:34.200* :  one of the main instigators of this coup. He has now tweeted that he regrets the actions that he
*05:34.200- 05:40.240* :  has taken and he regrets the board's action and wants Sam Altman back. The problem is Microsoft
*05:40.240- 05:45.480* :  have already said that Sam Altman can come work with Microsoft. Sam Altman's agreed,
*05:45.480- 05:52.580* :  as can Greg Brockman, as can anyone else. It appears that wants to work for Microsoft from OpenAI.
*05:52.580- 05:59.380* :  So you have this sort of warring faction within OpenAI. And you have this very, very wealthy company
*05:59.380- 06:05.860* :  saying you're welcome to come over this way. And so OpenAI now is in real chaos. OpenAI can
*06:05.860- 06:11.740* :  absolutely survive. I think the real issue though is if they were to lose hundreds of highly
*06:11.740- 06:16.540* :  skilled people, it's very hard to replace those people, particularly those engineers.
*06:16.540- 06:22.260* :  There aren't that many of them and they are incredibly highly sought after in Silicon Valley
*06:22.260- 06:27.780* :  and elsewhere. James Clayton in San Francisco. The US President Joe Biden says he believes
*06:27.780- 06:32.700* :  a deal to secure the release of some of the hostages abducted by Hamas from southern Israel
*06:32.700- 06:38.300* :  is getting nearer. Asked by a reporter at the annual Thanksgiving ceremony in Washington about
*06:38.300- 06:43.840* :  whether the rumoured deal was near. Mr. Biden crossed his fingers and replied, I believe so.
*06:52.280- 06:56.740* :  The US also says that fuel has reached Gaza following Israel's announcement,
*06:56.740- 07:00.860* :  it would allow limited supplies to support non-governmental organizations there.
*07:01.320- 07:04.680* :  The White House National Security spokesman John Kirby had this update.
*07:05.200- 07:09.820* :  Over the 18th and the 19th of November almost 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid were able to
*07:09.820- 07:15.340* :  enter Gaza. That brings a total to over 1260 and then following Israel's announcement that it's
*07:15.340- 07:20.400* :  allowing fuel now into Gaza to support non-governmental organizations at our strong request.
*07:20.400- 07:25.540* :  We are now tracking that six trucks have crossed into Gaza with approximately 18,000 gallons of
*07:25.540- 07:29.980* :  fuel that will help support food distribution and it will help generators for the hospital since
*07:29.980- 07:36.180* :  they can keep them working. Earlier on Monday the Hamas run health ministry in Gaza said at least 12
*07:36.180- 07:41.780* :  people were killed in an Israeli strike on the Indonesian hospital in the Palestinian territory.
*07:41.780- 07:47.120* :  The Indonesian foreign minister condemned to Israel's action and said it was a clear violation of
*07:47.120- 07:53.280* :  humanitarian law. Israel says its troops had been firing at, quote, terrorists inside the hospital
*07:53.280- 07:59.500* :  who'd been shooting at them. Meanwhile 28 premature babies evacuated from Gaza's biggest hospital,
*07:59.500- 08:05.600* :  Al-Shifah, have now arrived in Egypt for urgent treatment. We'll hear more about the possible
*08:05.600- 08:10.480* :  hostage negotiations in a moment but first I got an update on what's been happening in Gaza from
*08:10.480- 08:15.880* :  our Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman. Well what we've seen is an increasing military focus on
*08:15.900- 08:20.520* :  some of Gaza's hospitals, particularly in the North and the centerpiece of that has obviously
*08:20.520- 08:26.900* :  been the Al-Shifah Hospital in Gaza City. Israel alleges Hamas used the hospital and a tunnel
*08:26.900- 08:32.940* :  network underneath it says as a command and control center, culminating last night in a video
*08:32.940- 08:38.300* :  it released that it said was a house tunnel running underneath the hospital and also clips of
*08:38.300- 08:44.540* :  what it said was CCTV security camera footage from the hospital which showed the Israeli said
*08:44.980- 08:49.920* :  two hostages for our nationals being taken into the hospital by Hamas when they were snatched on
*08:49.920- 08:55.760* :  the day of the atrocities themselves. Now one of those people in the footage is clearly injured
*08:55.760- 09:01.340* :  on a hospital trolley inside. The other one is being sort of wrestled quite aggressively into the
*09:01.340- 09:06.980* :  hospital. It appears by government and Israel says these are Hamas militants. So some potentially
*09:06.980- 09:11.380* :  really significant evidence there whether or not they've got to the point of being able to prove
*09:11.380- 09:15.580* :  this is a command and control center it doesn't feel like they've got to that and this matters
*09:16.200- 09:21.760* :  because under international law an attack on a hospital is prohibited unless the hospital is used
*09:21.760- 09:27.340* :  for military purposes it can lose that protection but any attack on a hospital under international
*09:27.400- 09:33.120* :  rules has to be proportionate to the military advantage that will be gained. Basically Israel is
*09:33.120- 09:38.440* :  saying that another October the 7th could take place if these hospitals aren't attacked and
*09:38.440- 09:43.460* :  therefore it needs to show that is basically the basis of the fact that it besieged in the Gaza
*09:43.460- 09:47.860* :  strip and effectively cut off the functioning of these hospitals. And of course it also wants to get
*09:47.860- 09:52.880* :  the hostages out we've heard talk that a deal is close president Biden saying the same again
*09:52.880- 09:58.220* :  today what are you hearing? For 24 hours now there has been a growing sense that a deal is close
*09:58.220- 10:02.520* :  and I think it's really significant that we've had president Biden. In response to the question
*10:02.520- 10:08.940* :  is a hostage deal close he has said yes John Kirby the national security spokesperson also saying
*10:08.940- 10:15.440* :  the deal to release the hostages is getting closer. Tom Bateman in Jerusalem the United Nations says
*10:15.440- 10:22.500* :  emissions of greenhouse gases must fall by 42% by 2030 to reach the goal of limiting global warming
*10:22.500- 10:27.740* :  to one and a half degrees above pre-industrial levels. It's calling on countries to show much
*10:27.740- 10:33.180* :  greater ambition in a report released as countries gear up for next week's big climate summit
*10:33.180- 10:40.060* :  COP28 in Dubai. Our correspondent Nettael Feeck in New York told Tim Franks about the latest
*10:40.060- 10:46.300* :  UN findings. Well it shows that greenhouse gas emissions are reaching all time highs when really
*10:46.300- 10:52.060* :  those levels should be shooting down so we saw 1.2 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions
*10:52.060- 10:56.920* :  last year and that's really causing temperature records. I mean June, July, August,
*10:56.920- 11:01.220* :  September, October were all the hottest on record in fact this year is looking to be the hottest
*11:01.220- 11:07.340* :  on record and the secretary general spoke about the fact that in less greenhouse gas emissions fall
*11:07.340- 11:14.380* :  by 42% in six years that we won't be able to get to that 1.5 degree Celsius goal and he said if
*11:14.380- 11:20.780* :  you look at it the emissions report today shows that 22 giga tons we will be higher in emissions
*11:20.860- 11:27.220* :  than the 1.5 degree limit allows and he says that is the total present annual emissions of the US,
*11:27.220- 11:33.820* :  China and the EU combined. We hear that these massive cuts happen as you pointed out by 2030.
*11:33.900- 11:37.720* :  Does the UNEP give any suggestion that we are on course for that?
*11:37.940- 11:44.840* :  They say there's just a 14% chance of avoiding overshooting the 1.5 degree limit in the best
*11:44.840- 11:51.140* :  case scenario so they say we have to have economies going to phase out fossil fuels much faster
*11:51.140- 11:56.900* :  and if you look at the kind of 20 biggest economies in the world right now they aren't cutting
*11:56.900- 12:02.140* :  emissions at a rate consistent with their net zero targets and so they say we're more likely
*12:02.140- 12:06.160* :  on track to warm by nearly three degrees Celsius this century.
*12:06.420- 12:09.620* :  In terms of the damage to the world it would be utterly catastrophic.
*12:09.920- 12:15.460* :  Scientists refer to it as the point of no return talking about runaway melting ice sheets
*12:15.460- 12:21.800* :  in Antarctica, the Amazon rainforest drying out, the secretary general he's planning a trip
*12:21.800- 12:27.300* :  into Chilean Antarctica to try to see for himself what he thinks is the deadly impact of this crisis
*12:27.300- 12:32.300* :  and what it's going to look like if leaders don't go to cop with a kind of clear understanding
*12:32.300- 12:38.160* :  that they have to scale up their commitments to renewable transition they need to help those who
*12:38.160- 12:43.400* :  aren't the biggest polluters but who need financing and need help with their economies to transition
*12:43.840- 12:48.060* :  and I think that's the kind of key message from the UN that there is just a failure in leadership
*12:48.060- 12:52.740* :  right now. Netta Taufiq at UN Headquarters in New York talking to Tim Franks.
*12:53.220- 12:58.740* :  More than 200 people have been sentenced to jail in Italy in the biggest anti-Mafia trial
*12:58.740- 13:03.900* :  in decades. The case targeted the country's most powerful criminal syndicate, the Andrangata,
*13:04.400- 13:09.060* :  which is based in the southern Italian region of Calabria but which dominates Europe's cocaine
*13:09.060- 13:15.700* :  trade. Anna Sergei is professor of criminology and organized crime at Essex University here in England.
*13:15.700- 13:20.720* :  She's also the author of the book Chasing the Mafia and has been following proceedings closely.
*13:20.940- 13:27.520* :  She's a massive trial over 300 people in front of the court. However, the actual people who are
*13:27.520- 13:31.900* :  on this trial are not that relevant. They are people who have committed a series of crimes,
*13:31.900- 13:39.500* :  mostly soldiers and middlemen and a few bosses but only limited to a specific province of Calabria
*13:39.820- 13:44.600* :  Valencia which is not the main province where notoriously the Andrangata comes from.
*13:44.800- 13:48.780* :  It will have a big meaning for the community for sure but whether or not this is a blow to the
*13:48.780- 13:54.440* :  whole of the Andrangata, I doubt so. What can be learned, one thing is to have an helicopter
*13:54.440- 14:00.420* :  view on a territory, try and target the whole of the clan activities and the connections across
*14:00.420- 14:07.980* :  clans to photograph a territory in its entirety. The second lesson is to link the mafia activities
*14:07.980- 14:13.740* :  to activities of politicians and entrepreneurs and everyone who supports mafia activities but
*14:13.740- 14:19.660* :  does not belong to mafia's. So, mafia's cannot exist without these politicians and entrepreneurs.
*14:19.660- 14:25.380* :  We got some many sentences for some of the politicians involved. However, some of them were also
*14:25.380- 14:32.680* :  absolved. It's a very slippery slope of when does the political maneuvering begin and the
*14:32.680- 14:40.160* :  mafia protection ends in a way. This trial's biggest result has been to make the population of
*14:40.160- 14:45.480* :  the province particularly aware of the problem. Mafias are not invincible but the problem we have
*14:45.660- 14:50.060* :  is that we struggle to understand where they start and where they end, with the rigor that is
*14:50.060- 14:54.640* :  required by criminal law. Anna Sergi, professor of criminology and organized crime.
*14:55.580- 15:00.780* :  In many cities around the world, young people are struggling with stratospheric rents. North America
*15:00.780- 15:05.720* :  is one of the worst affected regions as can be seen by a listing in the Canadian city of Toronto
*15:05.720- 15:10.700* :  that's gone viral after it was spotted by a real estate agent. Just when you thought the Toronto
*15:10.700- 15:17.200* :  rental market couldn't get any worse, it did. I present to you shared bedroom in a lake facing
*15:17.200- 15:23.240* :  downtown condo for $900 a month. And for that price, the two roommates have to share a bed.
*15:23.260- 15:29.520* :  The global news podcast Stephanie Prentice used to live in Toronto. Back in 2016 when I moved out,
*15:29.520- 15:34.700* :  I had a very different experience. I had two bedrooms and a pool for the cost of my London one bed.
*15:35.200- 15:40.860* :  But for this person in today's market, yep, they're asking for $650 US dollars for a situation
*15:40.860- 15:46.120* :  where the two tenants sleep together in the same bed. And the agent who founds listing points out
*15:46.240- 15:51.760* :  this is a queen size bed. So she says not even room to create some sort of pillow divider for privacy.
*15:51.760- 15:56.280* :  But the fact the market is even in that situation where a pillow divider discussion would be taken
*15:56.280- 16:01.340* :  seriously is very telling. And we know the market in Toronto has been spiking year on year.
*16:01.500- 16:06.880* :  Now the comment section on this viral video has turned into some sort of therapy session for young
*16:06.880- 16:14.160* :  renters. One writes that he paid $750 a month to sleep on a sofa with no kitchen or bathroom access.
*16:14.220- 16:18.980* :  Another comment that in Halifax, which is seen as more affordable part of Canada, people are
*16:18.980- 16:23.780* :  renting out their balconies during the summer for people to sleep on with their belongings in boxes
*16:23.780- 16:29.520* :  beside them. Someone in China said young people there are doing it too and saying they've got rules
*16:29.520- 16:36.600* :  like no snoring, no sleepwalking and no romantic guests. This is a problem of course in London too.
*16:36.600- 16:41.020* :  What is going on with these rent rises everywhere around the world? The short answer for why it's
*16:41.020- 16:46.480* :  happening across the board is basically supply and demand. Demand is up since people return to major
*16:46.480- 16:51.380* :  cities after the peak of those COVID lockdowns. At the same time we've seen mortgage rates increasing
*16:51.380- 16:57.880* :  and construction decreasing in many places. And the shock of that is obviously being compounded
*16:57.880- 17:03.400* :  by the cost of living crisis. We've got salaries generally remaining stagnant in many sectors,
*17:03.400- 17:08.100* :  meaning of course people can't say for a deposit to buy and their stock in that cycle of renting.
*17:08.100- 17:13.620* :  All of that naturally will be felt hardest at the bottom end of income brackets and does explain
*17:13.620- 17:19.520* :  where young person may get desperate enough to advertise for a sleeping body. Stephanie Prentice
*17:22.100- 17:24.040* :  and still to come on the global news podcast.
*17:37.220- 17:43.880* :  The enduring power of amazing grace 250 years after it was written by an English slave owner.
*17:51.980- 17:56.920* :  Argentina's next president Javier Miele is unconventional to say the least, whether taking a
*17:56.920- 18:02.300* :  chainsaw to a rally or pledging to burn down the central bank and scrap the nation's currency.
*18:02.940- 18:07.880* :  Now in his first interview since his resounding victory he said he intends to privatise the state
*18:07.880- 18:13.760* :  energy company, public broadcasters and the state news agency. Everything that could be would be
*18:13.760- 18:19.020* :  put in the hands of the private sector he said. After his challenger the centrist Javier Massa
*18:19.020- 18:27.040* :  conceded Mr Miele promised change was on its way. To all those looking on from outside Argentina I want
*18:27.040- 18:32.320* :  to say to you all that Argentina will return to its place in the world that it should never have
*18:32.320- 18:37.620* :  lost. We're going to work shoulder to shoulder with all nations of the free world to help build a
*18:37.620- 18:44.040* :  better world. Today is a historic night not just for us but it's because it's the end of a
*18:44.040- 18:51.160* :  certain way of politics and the start of another. Mr Miele also confirmed that his first trips
*18:51.160- 18:57.700* :  abroad will be to the United States and Israel. Maria Esperanza Casulo is a political scientist and
*18:57.700- 19:03.180* :  professor at the National University of Rio Negro. She's also the author of Wider's populism work.
*19:03.820- 19:08.040* :  Evan Davis asked what the mood was like in Argentina following Sunday's result.
*19:08.380- 19:14.620* :  It's quite muted. It's hard to read. There was a very clear protest vote in anger but there's
*19:14.760- 19:22.640* :  not a huge outpouring of support. On the one hand the root cause is a deep feeling of anger in
*19:22.640- 19:28.980* :  the face of the bad economic situation. Argentina has been in an economic crisis for the last eight
*19:28.980- 19:35.480* :  years. Inflation is really high. There's also the question of why the electorate voted for the
*19:35.480- 19:41.900* :  most radical opposition candidate. What are the public expecting? Are they taking him literally when
*19:41.900- 19:47.820* :  he says he's going to sack half the civil servants and abolish the central bank and use dollars
*19:47.820- 19:55.820* :  in Argentina? Was that just campaign talk? I think the one promise that Miele has done that really
*19:55.820- 20:01.360* :  connected with parts of the electorate was the dollarization. In Argentina when you cannot buy
*20:01.360- 20:07.580* :  dollars, you cannot buy a car or you cannot travel abroad. When you ask the majority of Miele voters,
*20:07.580- 20:13.100* :  do you think he's going to be able to do what he says he's going to do? People say no, no, he's too
*20:13.100- 20:18.140* :  extreme. There's no way that he's going to be able to privatize public education or there's
*20:18.140- 20:24.100* :  no way he's going to privatize pensions. There's disambivalence in his voters that will have to
*20:24.100- 20:31.080* :  see whether these people come to support his policies or there's a backlash and the sense of betrayal.
*20:31.440- 20:37.260* :  I was reading on Twitter acts and one saying this guy isn't a change. Argentina is often voting
*20:37.260- 20:42.780* :  for charismatic incompetent people. This is a person who's very against Miele. Is that true? Because
*20:42.780- 20:47.340* :  we do sort of think of Argentina as almost the home of populism, a tendency to vote for.
*20:47.480- 20:53.100* :  Populous thinking really of Eva Perron. Yeah, populism and this sort of more personalistic
*20:53.100- 20:58.640* :  antagonistic profile in the public figures are important in the Argentine political culture,
*20:58.640- 21:03.000* :  which is something that you don't find in Chile or in Uruguay. They don't like this type of
*21:03.000- 21:09.220* :  politicians. But Argentina is kind of due. It's interesting because even people who are extremely
*21:09.220- 21:15.740* :  anti-peronists like Miele voters today or even throughout the 20th century, they continue to
*21:15.740- 21:22.920* :  gripe against populism. But when they choose to vote for somebody, they choose people that have
*21:22.920- 21:29.320* :  sort of the same characteristics. This larger than life, very polaristic figures. Even before
*21:29.320- 21:34.320* :  Miele, you can think, for example, in Carlos Menem in the 90s, who actually implemented some
*21:34.320- 21:40.560* :  of the more neoliberal policies that Miele is calling back to now. And he was also a larger than
*21:40.560- 21:46.880* :  life figure. Maria Esperanza Casulo talking to Evan Davis. You may be surprised to know that
*21:46.880- 21:52.860* :  thousands of Russians are living in Ukraine nearly two years after their nation launched its
*21:52.860- 21:59.080* :  full-scale invasion of the country. Some are even fighting in Ukraine's army, but life in Ukraine
*21:59.080- 22:04.660* :  isn't straightforward. They say they can't access basic services without Ukrainian passport.
*22:04.700- 22:09.760* :  And to get one, they need to travel to Russia to surrender their Russian citizenship.
*22:10.380- 22:12.960* :  Are Ukraine Correspondent James Waterhouse reports?
*22:15.740- 22:19.200* :  In a tiny village in Ukraine's central vignettes here region,
*22:19.900- 22:24.080* :  Galina spends her pregnancy stitching t-shirts for wounded soldiers.
*22:25.280- 22:31.920* :  Galina is in a limbo. She's desperate to escape. She would describe herself as a normal Ukrainian.
*22:31.920- 22:38.320* :  She was born here. She speaks and feels Ukrainian, but the country sees her as a Russian.
*22:38.820- 22:43.680* :  Changing your passport was difficult even before the war. Now is just impossible.
*22:44.960- 22:49.840* :  She got it when she moved there as a child with her family. Now back in Ukraine,
*22:49.840- 22:55.960* :  Galina can't get work. She can't access free health care, and her bank account is at risk of being
*22:55.960- 23:06.120* :  blocked. Her relationship with Ukraine is intertwined. She married Maxim, a Ukrainian soldier in a church.
*23:06.740- 23:12.800* :  An official refused to register our marriage. They said, come back when you have a passport.
*23:12.800- 23:18.620* :  In order to get a Ukrainian passport, she says she has to surrender her Russian citizenship,
*23:19.260- 23:24.660* :  either in a Russian consulate or Russia itself. She's afraid she wouldn't make it back.
*23:26.880- 23:32.500* :  On one main road in central Kiev sits this three-story white building. The garden is overgrown.
*23:32.500- 23:37.860* :  It's surrounded by a barbed wire fence. This is the Russian embassy. We're here to meet Anastasia,
*23:37.860- 23:45.000* :  a Russian who's experienced a long gravitational pull towards Ukraine. Anastasia left Russia in
*23:45.000- 23:51.920* :  2015 with the getting tired of the propaganda there. She's now a combat medic for Ukrainian forces.
*23:55.240- 23:58.300* :  What went through your mind on that morning of the 24th of February?
*23:58.660- 24:04.120* :  Okay, we're going to fight. Once I choose Ukraine as my homeland, I couldn't have to trade this church.
*24:04.120- 24:07.600* :  Were you seeing differently because you were Russian or did that not matter?
*24:07.920- 24:14.140* :  Nobody was asking my passport and my nationality when I was working. For sure, my colleagues
*24:14.140- 24:18.520* :  they know this is what I'm fighting for, not only for freedom and for my passport.
*24:19.220- 24:24.220* :  But can or should Ukraine make the system simpler for Russians living in the country?
*24:25.020- 24:31.800* :  We're now at the state migration service in Kiev to speak to Natalia Naumenko, who's in charge of it.
*24:31.800- 24:38.580* :  If a person identifies as a Ukrainian, that is not a reason to issue them with a Ukrainian passport.
*24:38.580- 24:43.780* :  No citizens from any country is discriminated against. If they have proper grounds to apply,
*24:43.780- 24:46.700* :  there is a list of documents they must provide.
*24:47.020- 24:52.700* :  Natalia argues the process has been made simpler for those fighting. But with the full-scale invasion,
*24:53.220- 24:58.000* :  she asks, why does Ukraine have to simplify it for all Russian citizens?
*25:00.060- 25:05.940* :  Back in Galina's idyllic village, she finds a moment a video called her husband Maxin on the front line.
*25:11.160- 25:16.180* :  If something happened to your husband, what would that mean for your family, given your situation?
*25:18.420- 25:23.700* :  I'm afraid to even think about it. If he gets warned it, I wouldn't be able to visit him in hospital,
*25:24.440- 25:29.000* :  to anyone else in the world we are strangers. It's very scary.
*25:29.840- 25:34.280* :  An anxiety, she tries to keep at the back of her mind again at the forefront.
*25:34.280- 25:39.560* :  That report from Ukraine by James Waterhouse. A human rights group in Cambodia says
*25:39.560- 25:45.160* :  clothing waste from Adidas, Walmart and more than a dozen other big firms is being burnt as
*25:45.160- 25:51.440* :  cheap fuel in brick factories and some workers are falling ill. Photos taken by investigators from
*25:51.440- 25:56.500* :  the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights show piles of fabric,
*25:56.500- 26:02.460* :  rubber and scraps of plastic. Cambodia is an important manufacturer for many leading brands and
*26:02.460- 26:07.820* :  waste is supposed to be disposed of in approved recycling centres or waste to energy plants.
*26:07.820- 26:11.300* :  Our Asia-Pacific Regional Editor, Celia Hatton told me more.
*26:11.420- 26:19.540* :  Cambodia has a huge garment industry, 700,000 people making stitching, clothing shoes, bags for big name
*26:19.540- 26:25.960* :  brands. There's a lot of waste created, but it seems that some of this waste, according to the report,
*26:25.960- 26:31.960* :  is being diverted and sold off to brick factories. They took photos of what they discovered there.
*26:31.960- 26:40.040* :  You could see mountains, just huge piles of what look like scraps of fabric and rubber and plastic,
*26:40.040- 26:45.180* :  but any of these things were stamped with the labels of the companies that they seemed to have
*26:45.180- 26:52.300* :  been made for. Lululemon, Lidol, Disney, the gap, Reebok, Adidas. It was very clear where
*26:52.300- 27:00.360* :  these things had come from. So this stuff is being burnt by these brick factories as fuel. What does
*27:00.360- 27:05.780* :  that mean for the workers there? The workers at the kiln factories and people living around the
*27:05.780- 27:12.020* :  factories are reporting things like migraines, respiratory problems. The report even
*27:12.020- 27:16.320* :  mentioned one pregnant woman who said she'd been having problems during her pregnancy
*27:16.380- 27:21.980* :  because she'd been living next to these brick factories and so quite disturbing things.
*27:22.380- 27:25.840* :  So will anything be done to stop this kind of thing happening? What are the firms saying?
*27:25.980- 27:30.820* :  I spoke to Adidas. They got back to me very, very quickly saying that they had launched their own
*27:31.820- 27:37.920* :  investigation to try to figure out how their factory waste ended up beside these brick factories.
*27:37.920- 27:42.420* :  They didn't discount the findings of this report. They were quite clear that they had quite strict
*27:42.420- 27:48.740* :  environmental policies. Other companies have seemingly ignored this report. They haven't gotten
*27:48.740- 27:54.380* :  back to the authors of this report. So so far we haven't heard anything from the gap or Disney,
*27:54.380- 28:00.780* :  for example. Other companies, Primark, Little, both say they're investigating and so
*28:00.780- 28:07.580* :  there's a mixture. Celia Hatton reporting. US researchers say they may have discovered why some
*28:07.580- 28:12.380* :  people get a headache after just one small glass of red wine. The investigators at the University
*28:12.380- 28:17.640* :  of California believe they've identified a compound in red grapes that can change how the body
*28:17.640- 28:23.160* :  metabolises alcohol. More details from our health reporter Michelle Roberts. Several theories have
*28:23.160- 28:28.880* :  been put forward for red wine headaches that can strike within 30 minutes of drinking even small
*28:28.880- 28:35.120* :  amounts. Some blame preservatives that prolong the shelf life of wine. Others say it could be a
*28:35.120- 28:41.100* :  blood vessel expander called histamine, another ingredient that's more common in red wine than
*28:41.100- 28:49.360* :  whites or rosays. Now a US team list another possible culprit, an antioxidant called quercetin
*28:49.360- 28:55.740* :  that red grapes make lots of in the sun. Expensive wines like Napa Valley Cabinets,
*28:56.020- 29:01.980* :  rather than cheap mass-produced plonks contain more of it the University of California teen warn.
*29:02.800- 29:08.780* :  In susceptible people, the theory is quercetin gets in the way of how the body breaks down alcohol,
*29:08.780- 29:17.400* :  making red wine somewhat toxic after just one glass. Harmful acetaldehyde builds up causing
*29:17.400- 29:23.440* :  the symptoms. The researchers still need to prove it in people and plan experiments by giving
*29:23.440- 29:30.340* :  volunteers prone to red wine headaches, a quercetin supplement or a dummy pill along with some alcohol
*29:30.340- 29:37.700* :  such as vodka. Our health reporter Michelle Roberts. Now when it's 250th anniversary year, the
*29:37.700- 29:43.440* :  him amazing grace has had an extraordinary journey since it was composed in a small town in England.
*29:43.440- 29:49.280* :  It was written in 1773 by a Liverpool slave trader turned abolitionist John Newton,
*29:49.280- 29:54.960* :  and it's gone on to become a hugely popular African-American anthem and global protest song.
*29:55.480- 29:58.420* :  James Wolvin has written a book exploring the history of the song.
*29:59.120- 30:15.680* :  Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. Listening and watching, President Obama
*30:15.680- 30:22.160* :  sing amazing grace in the summer of 2015, made me realize that there's more to this story
*30:22.160- 30:27.200* :  than just a simple account of him. He was the first African-American president,
*30:27.200- 30:32.980* :  giving an aeration for the murder of a group of black parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina,
*30:33.020- 30:39.400* :  and he suddenly burst into singing amazing grace. The congregation of 5,000 people in the College
*30:39.400- 30:44.020* :  of Charleston, basketball stadium arose to join him. It didn't have the printed version in
*30:44.020- 30:48.780* :  front of him, but they knew it would perfect. African-American slaves in the south turned to
*30:49.100- 30:54.320* :  amazing grace via their attachment to Methodist and Baptist churches and emerged as one of the
*30:54.320- 30:59.460* :  great songs of American gospel singers, not just the black gospel singers but black and white
*30:59.460- 31:05.480* :  gospel singers, but it becomes one of these songs that represents the ordeal of black people
*31:05.480- 31:10.500* :  in North America. And if you really want, to my mind, the most expressive version of that,
*31:10.500- 31:15.200* :  I think you need to turn to one of the great men of the 20th century, not merely for his voice,
*31:15.200- 31:19.120* :  but for his politics and his agitations, he marries some Paul Rookson.
*31:33.260- 31:38.540* :  It was written by an English minister in the late 18th century, and yet it's become this
*31:38.540- 31:44.440* :  remarkable, global anthem for mankind. And the man who wrote it, John Newton, very devout Christian,
*31:44.440- 31:50.100* :  but also a slave trade. But here's a man who wrote to him about grace, about forgiveness,
*31:50.100- 31:56.740* :  about putting hardship behind you, and yet it becomes a hymn that is beloved by millions of
*31:56.740- 32:01.480* :  African-Americans. Bony extraordinary things about amazing grace is not merely the solo version,
*32:01.560- 32:06.200* :  which you'll recall in their thousands, but the large numbers of choirs to sang it.
*32:06.320- 32:08.880* :  There's a wonderful version by a Soweto choir.
*32:20.860- 32:26.160* :  I'll save the rest. I'll save the rest.
*32:26.160- 32:28.880* :  I'll save the rest. I'll save the rest.
*32:28.880- 32:31.000* :  I'll save the rest. I'll save the rest.
*32:35.240- 32:40.220* :  As a version of Elvis, which I don't much alike, the revival in amazing grace, as a kind of
*32:40.300- 32:45.840* :  commercially popular song, is prompted by the version that Judy Collins recorded in a
*32:45.840- 32:47.160* :  chaplain, Columbia University.
*32:56.780- 33:00.220* :  John Newton certainly contested figure, how could he not be a man of such extraordinary
*33:00.220- 33:05.860* :  violent background? All the slave ships were violence in the extreme. It was not denying what he
*33:05.860- 33:11.540* :  did to slave the suffering he inflicted on hundreds of them. On the other hand, he begged redemption,
*33:11.560- 33:15.820* :  he begged forgiveness for his sins. And if you believe in redemption, well,
*33:16.260- 33:18.340* :  them is there as a token of that redemption.
*33:28.500- 33:34.540* :  The voice of Judy Collins, and we heard from James Wolvin on the history of amazing grace by John
*33:34.540- 33:41.120* :  Newton. And that's all from us for now, but the global news podcast will be back very soon.
