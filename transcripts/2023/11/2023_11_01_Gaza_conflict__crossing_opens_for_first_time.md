*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:11.680* :  from across the world the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported
*00:11.680- 00:19.720* :  by advertising. Sport, but not as you know it. Nothing is ever quite as expected. Amazing sports
*00:19.720- 00:26.560* :  stories from the BBC World Service. If the story is wriggly, contentious or hard to tame, I'll cover it.
*00:26.780- 00:32.500* :  Listen now wherever you get your BBC podcasts. This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World
*00:32.500- 00:39.300* :  Service. I'm Andrew Peach and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday, the first of November, these are our
*00:39.300- 00:45.540* :  main stories. Ambulances carrying seriously wounded Palestinians cross from southern Gaza into Egypt.
*00:45.540- 00:49.960* :  It's the first time people have been able to leave the territory since the current conflict between
*00:49.960- 00:55.020* :  Israel and Hamas began. Hamas says seven of the civilian hostages it's been holding have been
*00:55.020- 01:00.340* :  killed in Israeli air strikes were here from a friend of one and more than 200 hostages taken
*01:00.340- 01:05.860* :  last month. Please know that we are doing everything in our power to bring you home. Stay strong,
*01:05.860- 01:11.440* :  stay healthy, you will bring you home. A day after Israeli air strikes level part of Gaza's largest
*01:11.440- 01:18.640* :  refugee camp more attacks have reportedly struck the area. Also in this podcast the children fleeing
*01:18.640- 01:23.820* :  a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine and tech bosses and politicians gather to talk about
*01:23.820- 01:28.580* :  artificial intelligence. We should acknowledge that there's going to be some level of error in
*01:28.580- 01:34.040* :  these systems but they must always remain in human control and they must be introduced to society
*01:34.080- 01:41.980* :  at a rate at which we can all accept. We'll start in the southern tip of Gaza the
*01:41.980- 01:47.100* :  wrath of crossing on the border with Egypt. For the first time since the Israel Gaza war began on
*01:47.100- 01:52.240* :  the 7th of October, a number of foreign passport holders and seriously injured Palestinians are being
*01:52.240- 01:57.260* :  allowed to cross that border. Our Gaza correspondent, Rusty Abel Aluf, is at the wrath of crossing
*01:57.260- 02:03.240* :  and just before we recorded this podcast he sent us this update. I'm here and it extends the
*02:03.240- 02:07.840* :  morning we're in the in the morning it was thousands of people but then it turned out that
*02:08.020- 02:13.840* :  a list was taken this wall saying that those people about 500 people the only people who are allowed
*02:13.840- 02:21.920* :  to cross in this hall there is about 350 people already 150 were transported in buses no control
*02:21.920- 02:28.320* :  no passport control no stamp no electronic system here all is down only a civilian Palestinian
*02:28.320- 02:34.260* :  officer checking the bus boards and then allowing who's his name checking the list and allowing them
*02:34.260- 02:39.400* :  into the buses and then from here straight away to the Egyptian side where they will have the
*02:39.400- 02:46.580* :  brobar chicken and bus board control about 20 meters from here is another gate that designed to go
*02:46.580- 02:54.700* :  for cars and we have seen about 2030 ambulances carrying those who are seriously wounded by the
*02:54.700- 03:00.620* :  Israeli war from different hospitals including Nasr Hospital where I was reporting all the time
*03:00.940- 03:05.560* :  and they were taken now to the Egyptian side because we were injured and they it takes a little
*03:05.560- 03:10.500* :  bit of time because they don't have any IDs or any bus boards for the Egyptian will have to
*03:10.500- 03:15.880* :  identify them and then they will be transported into a field hospital outside this crossing near
*03:15.880- 03:21.460* :  10 kilometers and from there they will be taken to farther a treatment in Egypt but this is
*03:21.940- 03:27.840* :  very big significant people for about 7,000 Palestinians who have dual national and they they
*03:27.840- 03:33.900* :  were waiting for days to have this chance but also for tens of thousands of injured people including
*03:33.900- 03:40.580* :  many children and women who are waiting for this gate to be open so they can be sinned for medical
*03:41.020- 03:46.020* :  treatment. Our correspondent Rishdi Abu Al-Uluf at the RAFA crossing also monitoring the situation
*03:46.020- 03:51.260* :  from Jerusalem our Middle East correspondent Yolan Nell. So he had a first group of wounded
*03:51.260- 03:57.880* :  evacuees from Gaza crossing into Egypt this seems to be a deal that was involved the U.S.
*03:57.880- 04:05.000* :  involved the categories to get the crossing reopened at least temporarily and to prove that there
*04:05.000- 04:10.040* :  is a process here that can work because Egypt was very much worried about the crossing perhaps
*04:10.040- 04:15.980* :  being overrun. So what we saw earlier on our different live feeds coming in is some of these
*04:15.980- 04:20.880* :  patients being driven in ambulances through the RAFA border crossing we could see that there were
*04:20.880- 04:27.640* :  some children among those being taken off we think to a nearby field hospital a new field hospital
*04:27.640- 04:33.460* :  that Egypt has set up just a few kilometers away from the crossing. Now there were also a number
*04:33.460- 04:38.680* :  of foreigners people with foreign passports that were allowed out we've seen a first group heading
*04:38.680- 04:44.840* :  out on a bus there was a list of approved names more than 400 of them but we think that in Gaza
*04:44.840- 04:50.760* :  as a whole there are perhaps something like 7,000 foreign passport holders people who are hoping
*04:50.760- 04:56.520* :  to leave of course this was just a small fraction that was on this initial list but there was one
*04:56.520- 05:02.340* :  man who was talking a Jordanian saying that he was going back to his family and our man he
*05:02.340- 05:08.180* :  hoped and he would be very worried he said by you know what has been another day of awful bloodshed
*05:08.180- 05:14.480* :  in Gaza those scenes yesterday where we know that dozens of people were killed in Gebalia in the
*05:14.480- 05:18.440* :  north of the Gaza Strip and there's we're getting reports of the past couple of hours now about a
*05:18.440- 05:23.920* :  second set of air strikes on the Gebalia refugee camp at the second day of attacks there.
*05:24.200- 05:28.900* :  That's correct we've got those reports coming in that this is another large strike not very far
*05:28.900- 05:36.220* :  from the one that Israel says a day ago killed a senior Hamas commander and dozens of other fighters
*05:36.840- 05:43.040* :  with him it's been giving a military briefing on that basically saying that it killed this person
*05:43.040- 05:50.580* :  who it's saying was a key figure in those October the 7th attacks that were so deadly for Israel
*05:51.420- 05:56.440* :  and that when it was attacking his military stronghold that there was an underground
*05:57.380- 06:01.880* :  structure that was hit as well it says that you know these tunnels collapsing is what caused
*06:02.300- 06:07.520* :  the buildings above to collapse too and it's accusing Hamas of using people as human shields.
*06:08.300- 06:13.440* :  I'm at least correspondent Yalan now with me from Jerusalem. While the bombing continues in Gaza
*06:13.440- 06:20.060* :  of the around 240 hostages being held by Hamas there only four have been released one more was
*06:20.060- 06:26.160* :  rescued by the Israel Defense Forces. On Monday Hamas released a video of three Israeli hostages
*06:26.160- 06:31.000* :  all of them women and in which only one of them speaks in it she criticizes the Prime Minister
*06:31.000- 06:36.580* :  Benjamin Netanyahu and calls for the release of all of the hostages. Mr. Netanyahu condemned
*06:36.580- 06:42.200* :  the video as a cruel psychological piece of propaganda. Sherry Grossbar is a friend of the family
*06:42.200- 06:47.220* :  of one of the hostages Lena Trupanov she told my colleague Justin Webb how she felt when she saw
*06:47.220- 06:53.560* :  that video. It's a very complex feeling because on one hand we were happy okay we saw Lena we got
*06:53.560- 06:59.340* :  this proof of life on the other hand we're here at the headquarters of all the other families who
*06:59.700- 07:05.140* :  loved ones that been abducted and we're talking about a nine-month-old baby and then 87-year-old
*07:05.140- 07:10.620* :  grandmother and my heart went out for them because I know all they want is to hear that there are
*07:10.620- 07:16.560* :  loved ones are alive and okay so it's a very mixed feeling because you got people here you know
*07:16.560- 07:22.640* :  kind of rooting for us coming here hugging us saying oh we're so happy for you and we're crying
*07:22.640- 07:27.960* :  because I'm sad for them you know and also it's just Lena I mean we know that Sasha was abducted
*07:27.960- 07:32.920* :  we know that his girlfriend superior was abducted and we know that also grandmother was
*07:32.920- 07:37.680* :  abducted but we only have proof of life from these three women that were on the video and as you
*07:37.680- 07:43.560* :  see Lena Lena doesn't speak in the video but another of the women does speak and speaks a lot
*07:43.560- 07:52.220* :  about Benjamin Netanyahu and demands that he that Israel does more to get the hostages out what
*07:52.220- 07:59.420* :  what's your feeling about the way in which Israel is attempting at the moment to get them out
*07:59.420- 08:06.740* :  but also at the same time to fight a war in Gaza I'm not a politician and obviously this is a very
*08:06.740- 08:14.980* :  complex situation my only feeling or sentiment towards this whole ordeal is bring them home
*08:14.980- 08:23.160* :  right now I don't think any other country in the world would have 239 of their civilian you know
*08:23.160- 08:31.260* :  citizens women children baby being captivity and you know just do nothing about it this is date 25th
*08:31.860- 08:39.580* :  25 days or a lot of ones are not with us so I'm not going to go into Benjamin Netanyahu or should we
*08:39.580- 08:45.300* :  do this or should we do that everyone everyone in the world everyone is human should do everything
*08:45.300- 08:51.360* :  in their power to bring them back because it is not acceptable can I just have one final message
*08:51.360- 08:57.220* :  if for some reason they can hear us the host that is maybe the TV zone or or whatever please stay
*08:57.220- 09:03.480* :  strong please know that we are doing everything in our power to bring you home stay strong stay healthy
*09:03.480- 09:04.700* :  we will bring you home
*09:05.800- 09:12.100* :  cherry gross barred one of the hostages released 85-year-old Yotcha Verlif she was recounted being taken
*09:12.100- 09:18.140* :  by her captors into a spider's web of tunnels our security correspondent Gordon Carrera analyzes
*09:18.140- 09:23.740* :  videos from inside her masses underground network of tunnels thought to cover around 500 kilometers
*09:23.740- 09:30.140* :  under Gaza and explores how they could shape the next phase of the war back in 2015 the BBC was
*09:30.140- 09:35.360* :  shown tunnels in the south of Gaza run by a group allied to Hamas they were being used to hide
*09:35.360- 09:40.840* :  mortars which could be fired into Israel in the years since the tunnel network has grown enormously
*09:40.860- 09:46.840* :  the size of the tunnels with reinforced concrete to protect them they have lighting and electricity
*09:46.860- 09:53.600* :  and even what appears to be communication systems for years Hamas used the tunnels to emerge out
*09:53.600- 09:59.220* :  of Gaza and carry out attacks in Israel when Israel built a fence around Gaza this even extended
*09:59.220- 10:05.340* :  underground with concrete barriers to blocked tunnels but on October 7th Hamas did not just tunnel
*10:05.340- 10:11.140* :  out it also blew holes in the fences so what does this mean for any invasion tunnels pose a real
*10:11.140- 10:17.300* :  challenge for Israeli forces Hamas can use them to retreat hide weapons and stop-pass supplies
*10:18.020- 10:24.680* :  plan operations and emerge behind attacking soldiers those who fought in tunnels sets
*10:24.680- 10:29.620* :  incredibly challenging normal night vision goggles don't work communication is almost impossible
*10:29.620- 10:34.940* :  you lose sense of direction Israeli forces have been training to fight underground specialist
*10:34.940- 10:40.900* :  robots and ground penetrating sensors may help sponge bombs can expand to close up tunnels
*10:41.620- 10:46.420* :  but fighting Hamas on its home terrain where it's been preparing for years and laying traps
*10:46.420- 10:52.940* :  would be deeply challenging and Israel may try to avoid it another issue is the more than 200 hostages
*10:52.940- 10:58.840* :  who may be held underground one who was released describe walking for miles in what she called a
*10:58.840- 11:04.840* :  damp humid spiders web of tunnels the presence of hostages make some tactics like blowing up or
*11:04.840- 11:11.340* :  flooding tunnels more problematic our security correspondent Gordon Carrera BBC News Arabic has
*11:11.340- 11:16.480* :  announced an emergency radio service for Gaza in response to the conflict in the region it'll
*11:16.480- 11:21.780* :  broadcast daily programs on medium wave and those programs will begin this Friday
*11:23.140- 11:27.100* :  let's move on to other stories now and senior politicians and technology bosses are here in the
*11:27.100- 11:33.640* :  UK for a global summit to explore ways to ensure the safety of artificial intelligence representatives
*11:33.640- 11:38.920* :  from 27 different governments including the US and China are joining executives from firms like
*11:38.920- 11:43.900* :  Google Meta and Microsoft the tech billionaire Elon Musk is among the delegates who are talking
*11:43.900- 11:49.640* :  about things like how to manage existential threats like the loss of human control and bioterrorism
*11:50.100- 11:55.420* :  Mustafa Suleiman co-founded the Google owned artificial intelligence company deep mind so what does
*11:55.420- 11:59.620* :  he want to see come out of the summit we should acknowledge that there's going to be some level
*11:59.620- 12:04.960* :  of error in these systems but they must always remain in human control and they must be introduced
*12:05.360- 12:10.540* :  to society at a rate at which we can all accept and that means that we need the democratic process
*12:10.540- 12:14.660* :  it means that we need regulation and we have to start that conversation around how to create
*12:14.660- 12:20.200* :  contained safe and controlled AI our technology correspondent march is look is there too he's
*12:20.200- 12:24.320* :  been telling me a bit more about the guest list there was a little bit of play being made in the
*12:24.320- 12:28.260* :  press earlier in the week that the prime minister wish you see that might have been snubbed
*12:28.360- 12:32.380* :  a little bit by some world leaders you know US president Joe Biden isn't here for
*12:32.380- 12:36.620* :  inch president Emmanuel Macron and so on but we do have US vice president Kamala Harris
*12:36.620- 12:40.780* :  president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and at the very last minute we got
*12:40.780- 12:45.340* :  that announcement that Elon Musk is going to be making an appearance sprinkling a little bit of
*12:45.400- 12:50.460* :  celebrity tech billionaire Stardust over the event we've also been hearing from Sam Altman
*12:50.700- 12:56.360* :  now he's the CEO of open AR that's a company behind chat GPT which is arguably kicked off a lot
*12:56.360- 13:00.860* :  of the interest in artificial intelligence in the first place you know this time last year
*13:01.440- 13:06.920* :  most of us weren't talking about large language models and chatbots right now artificial intelligence
*13:06.920- 13:12.460* :  is absolutely at the top of headlines all around the world and that's what this summit is about
*13:13.240- 13:17.980* :  exploring some of the risks and some of the opportunities that this technology presents
*13:18.420- 13:22.320* :  it always seems to be that we use the label now to talk about lots of things that we were talking
*13:22.320- 13:27.860* :  about last year or the year before we just label everything as AI it's a huge subject what other
*13:27.860- 13:32.260* :  big worries they've got that they're going to try and thrash through in the next few hours and days
*13:32.580- 13:37.340* :  there's lots and lots of different technologies that come under the umbrella of AI and machine
*13:37.340- 13:42.480* :  learning that's right last week the PM set out the government's stall if you'd like for this event
*13:42.520- 13:48.040* :  the outlined in almost apocalyptic terms some of the dangers and the risks that artificial intelligence
*13:48.040- 13:53.060* :  poses from making it easier for people to help create chemical weapons so the human race
*13:53.060- 13:58.520* :  losing control of the technology completely now it's worth saying that there are a lot of industry
*13:58.520- 14:04.300* :  experts that say that's a pretty unlikely scenario but there's an argument amongst AI experts
*14:04.300- 14:08.520* :  that some of the stuff that's being discussed here is the wrong things that we're perhaps looking
*14:08.520- 14:16.160* :  a bit too far into the future issues like bias for instance that if AI tech is trained on biased
*14:16.160- 14:22.140* :  information and biased data then it produces biased results now this can lead to really worrying
*14:22.140- 14:26.640* :  outcomes for people affected by this technology if it's applied in the public sector for instance
*14:26.640- 14:32.240* :  bias conclusions around race religion sexuality all of those kind of things can have tangible
*14:32.280- 14:37.620* :  harmful effects on people so there were plenty of AI experts who think these kind of issues
*14:37.620- 14:43.040* :  present more of an urgent problem than so the topics being discussed at the summit this week
*14:43.660- 14:48.480* :  our technology correspondent Mark Chiswick now some good AI news artificial intelligence can
*14:48.480- 14:53.980* :  identify the aggressiveness of rare cancers according to a new study today researchers from the
*14:53.980- 14:58.840* :  Royal Marsden Hospital in London say using the technology could improve the treatment of patients
*14:58.840- 15:04.660* :  and benefit thousands of people every year the studies lead Professor Christine MSU has been talking
*15:04.660- 15:10.740* :  to my colleague Amal Rajan this study has been set up to look at retroperitoneal sarcoma so these are
*15:10.740- 15:15.580* :  rare cancers they sit at the back of the abdomen and because they're rare they're often overlooked
*15:15.580- 15:22.820* :  or misdiagnosed and that delay in diagnosis has catastrophic consequences for our patients so to step
*15:22.820- 15:28.560* :  up to that challenge we have trained an algorithm that can look at a patient CT scan and firstly
*15:28.560- 15:34.040* :  assess whether the patient might have one of these rare cancer types but secondly and perhaps
*15:34.040- 15:40.440* :  even more importantly from the scan it can assess how aggressive that cancer is and that's a really
*15:40.440- 15:46.320* :  important piece of information because it helps us to select the right treatment for the right
*15:46.320- 15:52.240* :  patient and as you've described we found that the AI was twice as accurate as an invasive
*15:52.800- 15:57.200* :  procedure the how soon is this technology I mean those those numbers are very startling how soon
*15:57.200- 16:01.740* :  is this technology going to start transforming lives and have implications for wider oncology this
*16:01.740- 16:08.240* :  particular algorithm has been trained to spot and grade these very rare cancers however the methodology
*16:08.240- 16:14.180* :  and the lessons that we've learnt from this study will now be applied to other cancer types now
*16:14.180- 16:19.300* :  we're talking a lot about safety at the moment aren't we in risk and actually one of the critical
*16:19.300- 16:24.000* :  next steps which is what we're about to embark on is that we're going to monitor this performance
*16:24.100- 16:30.700* :  the performance of this algorithm very closely over time because actually the safety and how these
*16:30.700- 16:36.520* :  algorithms perform can change over time so the next step is for us to monitor it very closely
*16:36.520- 16:41.340* :  before we even consider allowing it to support our clinical decision making for patients.
*16:42.060- 16:43.400* :  Professor Christine Messier
*16:45.620- 16:50.840* :  now still to come in this podcast what do these films have in common open the five bay doors hell
*16:51.720- 16:54.920* :  I'm sorry Dave I'm afraid I can't do that
*17:00.280- 17:06.440* :  same freighter off to do this same freighter off to do that that was 2001 a space odyssey and the god
*17:06.440- 17:12.800* :  father too the answer is they're both long and therefore had intervals but should cinema intervals
*17:12.800- 17:16.100* :  be brought back question while answer later in this podcast
*17:20.060- 17:26.740* :  heatwaves floods droughts wildfires catastrophic consequences from climate change what's going on

*21:35.680- 21:41.080* :  that slogan but they claim it'll be an uphill battle with Mr Vucic and the government dominating
*21:41.080- 21:46.240* :  the media the authorities in charge of the Panama Canal have announced further reductions in
*21:46.240- 21:51.360* :  shipping traffic because of what they say is the worst drought for more than 70 years so how
*21:51.360- 21:56.220* :  important is this route for maritime trade here's our business correspondent Katie Silver
*21:56.580- 22:02.080* :  it's very important and that's because the canal given its location greatly reduces the time
*22:02.080- 22:06.860* :  and the distance that ships have to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and to give
*22:06.860- 22:12.840* :  you an idea just to profile one economy such as the US many US exports and imports travel through
*22:12.840- 22:17.560* :  the canal every day about 10 percent overall and of course that means things when it comes to jobs
*22:17.560- 22:22.760* :  for the US citizens who are making these goods as well as the imports as well so it's hugely
*22:22.760- 22:29.420* :  important for global trade and typically you know it operates about 24 hours a day 365 days a year
*22:29.420- 22:34.260* :  according to the website normally about 14,000 ships use it every year that's on average about
*22:34.260- 22:39.720* :  38 a day but now we're hearing from the Panama Canal Authority and it says it's been forced to make
*22:39.720- 22:45.840* :  the decision due to this being the driest October since records began in 1950 to restrict the vessels
*22:45.840- 22:51.080* :  that can travel through it what we've seen so far is earlier this year the number of typically as
*22:51.080- 22:55.800* :  I say about 38 ships every day vessels every day were traveling through earlier this year that was
*22:55.800- 23:01.240* :  reduced to 31 a day starting from the 3rd of November 25 a day and by February next year just 18
*23:01.240- 23:06.560* :  slots for vessels to pass through every day now this is because of less water being in the reservoir
*23:06.560- 23:11.600* :  that typically feeds the locks that go into this ship we're already seeing a big impact it's causing
*23:11.600- 23:16.200* :  shipping rates to go up there's delays and there's also impacts that it may have on the cost of
*23:16.420- 23:21.460* :  shipping liquefied natural gas let's go back to our main story the conflict in the middle east
*23:21.860- 23:26.920* :  any hope of resurrecting plans for a two-state solution part of the historic Israeli Palestinian
*23:26.920- 23:32.460* :  peace process is now a remote possibility the two-state solution calls for establishing an
*23:32.460- 23:38.260* :  independent state of Palestinians alongside Israel so why has the peace process all but collapsed
*23:38.260- 23:43.220* :  James Coppnault has been getting the assessment of Dr. Gabel Maitre who's a renowned Hungarian
*23:43.220- 23:48.780* :  Canadian physician and author his grandparents were killed in the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz
*23:49.180- 23:54.120* :  James started by asking whether he thought this war was inevitable peace could have made a long
*23:54.120- 24:00.380* :  time ago but given the long-time occupation and disposition of the Palestinians it's impossible
*24:00.380- 24:06.620* :  to avoid conflict terrible and atrocious as recent events were anybody who's been there and
*24:06.620- 24:12.060* :  visited the occupied territories and Gaza as I have is not surprised that this outburst of rage
*24:12.060- 24:17.540* :  and violence the question is how come it didn't happen sooner and that's not to justify it
*24:18.080- 24:22.960* :  but it's just to say that given the conditions there some explosion was almost inevitable
*24:23.740- 24:28.200* :  there are many in Israel who would push back against that who would say that killing civilians
*24:28.200- 24:35.540* :  killing children as Hamas did can never be justifiable that did you hear me say that is justifiable
*24:35.540- 24:42.540* :  I said it was unjustifiable sure I must did I agree was an atrocity but it's not the first time
*24:42.540- 24:47.560* :  children have been killed many hundreds even thousands of Palestinians children have been killed
*24:47.560- 24:53.580* :  by Israeli bombs over the decades in the West Bank several children have been killed by settlers
*24:53.580- 24:59.440* :  this year the West barely hears about it now I'm speaking as a Jewish physician and I've been
*24:59.440- 25:04.000* :  to the guards and I've been to the West back and I've seen that with my own eyes now that many
*25:04.000- 25:09.380* :  Israelis pushed back against it is perfectly understandable because most people most of the
*25:09.380- 25:14.980* :  time are just not aware of what happens that's not because people are bad most people most of the time
*25:14.980- 25:20.660* :  were too caught up in their own propaganda to know what's really going on under their eyes and
*25:20.660- 25:28.980* :  that's just how it is why do you think America canada many Western governments are so firmly in
*25:28.980- 25:36.900* :  support of Israel let's quote Winston Churchill god blesses imperialist soul he said back in 1920
*25:37.020- 25:42.240* :  that the establishment of a Jewish entity in Palestine is in the best interests of the
*25:42.240- 25:49.060* :  British Empire and it was the British mandate that allowed the Zionist project by which which
*25:49.060- 25:54.240* :  I used to believe in fervently with all my heart it was the British mandate in Palestine that
*25:54.240- 26:00.940* :  allowed the basis of the Jewish state to be established and the Western powers favor these
*26:00.940- 26:06.780* :  colonial entities in the heart of indigenous populations it serves their interests when the
*26:06.780- 26:12.900* :  British Empire was replaced by the American Empire then America became the sponsor and still is
*26:13.560- 26:18.480* :  you say you used to fervently believe in the Zionist project what changed for you
*26:19.160- 26:24.700* :  well look I was born a Jewish infant in hungry two months before the Nazis occupied hungry my
*26:24.700- 26:31.020* :  grandparents died in Auschwitz sold it in nearly I was was very close to being deported with my mother
*26:32.020- 26:38.400* :  and I grew up with a strong sense of injustice and when I discovered Zionism it was like a real
*26:38.400- 26:43.540* :  salvation for me oh I was Jews standing up and I established your own state affirming your own
*26:43.540- 26:50.560* :  identity and being strong and not defenseless anymore that's until I found out the history
*26:50.560- 26:56.480* :  in my late teens early 20s and the history didn't flatter the Zionist narrative it showed that
*26:56.480- 27:01.740* :  there was never what the Zionist called a land without a people for a people without a land there
*27:01.740- 27:06.620* :  was a people with an indigenous population there so you know when I found out the history that
*27:06.700- 27:13.000* :  that in order to establish this Jewish dream we had to visit a nightmare on the Palestinians I said no
*27:13.000- 27:16.580* :  I don't want any part of that ideology anymore and that's what changed for me
*27:17.100- 27:21.820* :  don't together mate with James Coppnell let's go back to another subject we mentioned earlier in
*27:21.820- 27:26.940* :  the podcast the Collins English Dictionary has announced it's word of the year maybe unsurprisingly
*27:26.940- 27:32.640* :  it is AI it was chosen from a short list of 10 other words including other terms we've become
*27:32.640- 27:38.740* :  familiar with greed flation meaning using inflation to create profit bas ball a type of cricket
*27:38.740- 27:44.260* :  played by the England team of late you less those ultra low emission zones that are appearing in
*27:44.260- 27:49.200* :  cities around the world but why has AI made it to the top spot seeing as it's not that new
*27:49.560- 27:54.080* :  and strictly speaking it's not even a word here's Helen Newsted who's an exocographer at Collins
*27:54.580- 27:58.340* :  well when we look at word of the year we consider all aspects of language or what we call
*27:58.340- 28:02.980* :  black school units so we might look at single words sometimes we look at compound words like
*28:02.980- 28:08.020* :  climate strike for example or asylum seeker and we also look at abbreviations are a very common
*28:08.020- 28:11.800* :  part of the language and in fact the Collins English Dictionary has thousands of abbreviations
*28:11.800- 28:16.340* :  in it so we look at all aspects of language it's not a new concept it's been around since the 1950s
*28:16.360- 28:20.500* :  but really it was cast apart into our public consciousness this year with the arrival of a new
*28:20.500- 28:25.360* :  type of AI or generative AI the first example of that was chat GPT and it was launched in November
*28:25.360- 28:31.120* :  22 and by January of 2023 it had a hundred million users which were completely unprecedented in the
*28:31.120- 28:34.820* :  rollout of other consumer applications and you know where is AI had been working away for us in
*28:34.820- 28:38.120* :  the background I think many of us hadn't really thought about it that much we weren't really
*28:38.120- 28:42.900* :  aware of it and so this is the first time that we could all engage directly with AI in what seemed
*28:42.900- 28:47.200* :  like a very human like way we were very excited by the beginning we'll have fun with it and we were
*28:47.200- 28:51.260* :  writing raps in the style of Shakespeare and sharing them on social media but there was a kind of
*28:51.260- 28:56.060* :  inevitable backlash and a sort of wave of debate with our jobs be safe what are their safety
*28:56.060- 29:00.860* :  concerns are the only risks could it pose a existential threat even so it's been a very dominant
*29:00.860- 29:04.320* :  part of our conversation this year and that was why we decided it was a worthy winner
*29:04.320- 29:10.020* :  word of the year lexicographer Helen Newsted now let's move on and talk about films here's a clip
*29:10.020- 29:16.160* :  from the new Martin Scorsese movie Killers of the Flower Moon we have so many deaths we've lost count
*29:16.600- 29:22.320* :  this just man look seems more like an epidemic than bad luck to me
*29:24.600- 29:29.360* :  no say just dying by the enemy do not let them die alone
*29:30.640- 29:35.940* :  evils around my heart this is an epic film three hours and 26 minutes in duration
*29:35.940- 29:40.860* :  and some cinema chains have decided that's too long to watch in one go so they've introduced
*29:40.860- 29:46.960* :  an interval is that a good idea irisca Ivan Zada is chief film critic of the Metro newspaper in
*29:46.960- 29:52.100* :  the UK and it was the norm until I think the 1980s in the UK and it's still I think standard in
*29:52.280- 29:56.220* :  Belgium Germany certainly in India where they have those massive Bollywood epics that you definitely
*29:56.220- 30:01.140* :  need a break for so I think it could become the norm what I'd say is if it's a great film
*30:01.500- 30:05.820* :  you don't necessarily need an interval but generally looking at the killers of the flower
*30:05.820- 30:10.080* :  when it's three minutes shorter than the Irishman Martin Scorsese previous film he's made seven
*30:10.080- 30:14.680* :  films now that are over three hours long and that one I really felt like I could do with an
*30:14.680- 30:18.060* :  interval I could do with the stretch and I could just do with a you know I think if you're a cinema
*30:18.060- 30:23.160* :  goer you do appreciate it but I can understand artistically you might feel the other way round
*30:23.160- 30:27.780* :  if you're the actual director I think we are though getting used to long-form storytelling through
*30:27.780- 30:32.200* :  sitting through films at home watching streaming though that said if you're at home watching
*30:32.200- 30:35.880* :  killers of the flower moon you can always pause it it can't even pop to the loo and maybe watch
*30:35.880- 30:40.160* :  it again the next day so I think although we are embracing that idea of long-form storytelling
*30:40.160- 30:46.620* :  and the fact that maybe we can't fit everything we want to in 90 minutes to tell exactly the story
*30:46.620- 30:50.800* :  we want it's difficult to balance that with you know audience expectation and frankly the fact
*30:50.800- 30:53.820* :  that you do need to go through and you do need to stretch your legs and much so I love
*30:53.820- 30:58.860* :  killers of the flower moon at the end my back was very stiff indeed that was LaRoucheca Ivan Zada
*30:58.860- 31:04.300* :  who's a film critic and that's all from us for now there will be a new edition of Global News
