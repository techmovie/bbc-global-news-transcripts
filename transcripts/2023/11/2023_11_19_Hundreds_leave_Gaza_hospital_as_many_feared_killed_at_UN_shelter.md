*01:20.440- 01:24.500* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Sunday the 19th of
*01:24.500- 01:29.480* :  November. The Hamasser on health authorities in Gaza say 80 people have been killed in two
*01:29.480- 01:34.840* :  airstrikes on the Jabbalia refugee camp. In a rally in Jerusalem, thousands of Israelis have
*01:34.840- 01:39.720* :  called on the government to focus more on freeing the hostages. And tens of thousands of people
*01:39.720- 01:43.920* :  in Spain have protested against the amnesty deal for Catalan separatists.
*01:46.220- 01:47.140* :  Also in the podcast,
*01:53.340- 01:58.060* :  Elon Musk hails the latest test launch of his giant Starship rocket as a success,
*01:58.060- 02:02.520* :  even though it ends in an explosion. And should you text before calling?
*02:07.820- 02:13.380* :  When Israel began its attacks on Gaza following the massacre of 1200 people by Hamass,
*02:13.640- 02:18.520* :  an Israeli military spokesman said the emphasis is on damage, not on accuracy.
*02:18.700- 02:25.880* :  According to Hamass health officials, 12,300 people have now been killed in the Palestinian territory.
*02:26.660- 02:31.100* :  The ferocity of the Israeli assault has worried some of the relatives of the more than 200
*02:31.100- 02:35.880* :  hostages being held in Gaza. And those families have been pushing the Israeli government
*02:35.880- 02:41.740* :  to do more to prioritize the captives. On Saturday, thousands gathered outside the residents of
*02:41.740- 02:45.420* :  the Prime Minister in Jerusalem after a five-day march from Tel Aviv.
*03:00.940- 03:05.700* :  Does it isn't telling them what's going on? What are the offers? What are the reasons for
*03:05.700- 03:08.360* :  and against nothing? Nobody's talking to them.
*03:09.160- 03:14.820* :  Today is my husband's birthday, and his mother Riafadar is kidnapped.
*03:15.360- 03:20.660* :  She is 85 years old. We don't have time. We don't have one hour more.
*03:20.920- 03:25.860* :  We cannot wait any longer, so we are demand from them to do that now, to pay any price,
*03:25.860- 03:27.440* :  to bring the hostages back.
*03:27.580- 03:32.340* :  Well, we hear more about the march in a moment, but in Gaza itself, Israel has been accused of
*03:32.340- 03:37.540* :  killing more than 80 people in twin strikes on the Jabbalia refugee camp in the north of the strip.
*03:37.540- 03:42.860* :  Hamass health officials said most of the victims had died in a UN school being used as a shelter.
*03:43.540- 03:48.020* :  Israeli defense forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said they were investigating
*03:48.020- 03:53.940* :  what happened. I can't confirm this incident is an IDF, but we are seeing the images like you've
*03:53.940- 03:58.080* :  seen the images on social media. We are looking into it. I can't confirm at this stage that
*03:58.080- 04:02.740* :  this is an IDF, but we are looking into it. Palestinian medical staff also said Israeli
*04:02.740- 04:08.920* :  air strikes on residential blocks in Khan Unis in southern Gaza had killed at least 32 people.
*04:08.940- 04:14.040* :  Israel has been telling people in the south to evacuate again after they were told to move
*04:14.040- 04:18.760* :  there from the north. On Saturday, many of the patient's medical staff and displaced people
*04:18.760- 04:24.160* :  sheltering at Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, left on foot, saying they've been given an
*04:24.160- 04:30.300* :  ultimatum by the Israelis, something Israel denied. The Palestinian Authority Health Minister in
*04:30.300- 04:38.060* :  the West Bank is Mai al-Khala. The occupation army this morning had demanded the evacuation of the
*04:38.060- 04:44.620* :  hospital of patients, the injured and medical staff, as well as those seeking shelter in the hospital
*04:44.620- 04:51.040* :  within one hour, meaning within one hour they should evacuate to face their unknown fate.
*04:51.040- 04:58.980* :  They were evicted at gunpoint and those who remained are 126 patients, five doctors and 34
*04:58.980- 05:05.940* :  premature babies. The situation at the Al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, according to the Palestinian
*05:05.940- 05:11.900* :  Authority Health Minister, the BBC has been trying to verify footage of the apparent attacks
*05:11.900- 05:18.220* :  on the Jabbalia refugee camp, also in northern Gaza, as I heard from our correspondent Nick Beak
*05:18.220- 05:24.200* :  in Jerusalem. It's certainly a horrifying footage that is emerging from Jabbalia today.
*05:24.760- 05:29.500* :  Horrifying fact is the word that the head of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency has
*05:29.500- 05:34.060* :  been using to describe this. We've been looking at some of the footage and it is extremely
*05:34.060- 05:39.920* :  bleak. Basically, you see a man who's narrating a video and he is walking from classroom to
*05:39.920- 05:45.220* :  classroom within this United Nations run school and it is a scene of carnage of devastation.
*05:45.220- 05:50.540* :  There are bodies. People are severely injured at one point. There's a young child who looks
*05:50.540- 05:56.600* :  bewildered, startled, looking at the camera. Also within this you see that there is a lot of
*05:56.640- 06:02.600* :  damage to one wall. There's a huge hole in the wall, but the structure itself appears to be in
*06:02.600- 06:07.900* :  tax. This video and colleagues at the BBC have been looking at this today. The video it seems
*06:07.900- 06:13.840* :  was taken today. The weather in the video matches the conditions on the ground in Jabbalia this morning
*06:13.840- 06:19.900* :  and also the structure in the video matches previous photographs of the United Nations school.
*06:19.900- 06:25.420* :  What we can't say is what caused this. Certainly there have been accusations that this is an
*06:25.420- 06:31.500* :  Israeli strike. The Israelis have been saying and also a military spokesperson told the BBC today
*06:31.500- 06:35.260* :  that they're aware of the video and they are looking into this. They're investigating.
*06:35.260- 06:40.260* :  Of course Israel says it has been targeting Hamas in the North Jabbalia in the North
*06:40.820- 06:46.180* :  of the strip as is al-Shifa hospital and the Israelis say they've been telling people to leave
*06:46.180- 06:51.760* :  those areas head to the south. But now we're also hearing about Israeli attacks in the south
*06:51.760- 06:57.100* :  on the residential blocks in Han Unis, according to the Palestinians. That's right. Medics there
*06:57.100- 07:03.360* :  say that at least 32 people were killed in a strike on a residential block as you say or
*07:03.360- 07:08.700* :  actually residential blocks as a couple of buildings at least. This is significant because the
*07:08.700- 07:14.520* :  Israelis as you say previously cited Han Unis the biggest city in the south as being a place of
*07:14.660- 07:19.520* :  safety that people from the north should move to. But what we're seeing now is people have been told
*07:19.520- 07:25.280* :  to get out by four o'clock local time. So that has long passed that deadline some four hours ago.
*07:25.280- 07:31.840* :  There has been the dropping of leaflets which have been instructing people to move to safety
*07:31.840- 07:37.740* :  four specific locations have been given as well as other sort of shelters. And so once again
*07:37.740- 07:43.220* :  people who've been told to move to leave their homes they've moved to a place of safety and once
*07:43.220- 07:47.700* :  again they're being told to move again. Israel says that's because they'll be out of harm's way
*07:47.700- 07:53.920* :  as they continue to intensify their operations against Hamas. Israel says it's targeting Hamas
*07:54.260- 07:58.020* :  and it's doing all it can to keep down the number of civilians who've been injured who've been
*07:58.220- 08:04.080* :  killed. Nick Beak in Jerusalem will also in Jerusalem for us is the BBC's Yogatilla Mai and she's
*08:04.080- 08:09.180* :  been speaking to some of the families who took part in that rally I mentioned earlier. I asked her
*08:09.180- 08:13.700* :  what the relatives of the hostages thought of the Israeli military operation in Gaza.
*08:14.100- 08:19.360* :  Their view is that what needs to be prioritized at the moment is the return of the hostages.
*08:19.880- 08:25.140* :  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an interview a couple of days ago said that their top priorities
*08:25.140- 08:31.800* :  are first the destruction of Hamas, then the release of hostages. I was speaking to Elay David
*08:31.800- 08:39.540* :  who is the brother of 22-year-old Evita David who was taken hostage from a music festival held
*08:39.540- 08:46.220* :  in southern Israel according to him. Whatever deal needs to be negotiated for the safe return of
*08:46.220- 08:51.060* :  the hostages that needs to happen first and then everything else can happen after that.
*08:51.420- 08:57.500* :  Is there any chance of the government listening to those calls to pay any price to get the hostages
*08:57.500- 09:01.040* :  back given that that would be likely to involve a ceasefire which they don't want to do?
*09:01.520- 09:06.360* :  The families of the hostages are meeting with some members of the Israeli war cabinet today.
*09:06.700- 09:11.900* :  What they were saying to me is that they've had very little information from them so far.
*09:11.900- 09:16.840* :  They're looking for some answers. One of them said we're waiting for our leaders to look us in the
*09:16.840- 09:21.800* :  eye and explain to us what exactly is being done. Of course, it's six weeks since these people
*09:21.800- 09:27.020* :  were taken hostage. There are around 30 children. There are lots of elderly people who require
*09:27.020- 09:33.780* :  medication every single day. I met with the son of one woman who's 84 years old who said his mother
*09:33.780- 09:40.300* :  requires medicines for a heart ailment. She requires other medicines to keep her going and he's
*09:40.300- 09:44.840* :  worried about what kind of condition she's going to be in. Patients running out, they're getting
*09:44.840- 09:48.600* :  increasingly frustrated. They're saying, you know, leaders aren't meeting them enough.
*09:48.600- 09:55.580* :  Yogi Te Lamai in Jerusalem. Other news now, with about 170,000 people taking part,
*09:55.580- 10:00.880* :  the demonstration in the Spanish capital Madrid on Saturday was the biggest so far over the decision
*10:00.880- 10:06.560* :  by the Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, to grant amnesty to Catalan separatists. Mr. Sanchez
*10:06.560- 10:12.760* :  needed the support of pro-independence parties to secure another term in office. Protesters say it
*10:12.760- 10:20.320* :  was unconstitutional. Guy Hedgeko reports from Madrid. Protesters, many waving the red and yellow
*10:20.320- 10:26.160* :  Spanish flag and the blue and gold European one gathered in one of Madrid's most famous squares,
*10:26.160- 10:33.000* :  Plata de Thielis. They said Pedro Sanchez's amnesty was unconstitutional, undermined a rule of law
*10:33.000- 10:39.360* :  and threatened national unity. The amnesty will benefit more than 300 Catalan nationalists who face
*10:39.360- 10:45.300* :  criminal charges for separatist activity. The demonstration was organized by civic groups.
*10:45.920- 10:51.180* :  Opposition politicians who are calling for new elections were there as well. The leader of the
*10:51.180- 10:57.220* :  Conservative People's Party Alberto Núñez Fejo said the alarm bells of Spanish democracy were
*10:57.220- 11:03.020* :  ringing. Anagrao is a member of the Catalan Parliament for Thielis Anos, which supports a united
*11:03.020- 11:10.500* :  Spain. We are protesting not an agreement, but an abandonment we have been betrayed by our government.
*11:10.760- 11:17.100* :  Mr. Sanchez says the amnesty will reduce political tensions in Catalonia. This was the biggest of recent
*11:17.100- 11:25.660* :  protests against it, but almost certainly not the last. Guy Hedgeko in Madrid. Argentinians go to
*11:25.660- 11:30.380* :  the polls on Sunday in the final round of what's turned out to be an election of surprises.
*11:30.840- 11:35.800* :  The runoff is a straight head-to-head between contrasting characters, the current economy minister
*11:35.800- 11:42.260* :  Sergio Massa and a former pundit and political outsider Javier Millet. The vote comes at a particularly
*11:42.260- 11:47.520* :  difficult time for Argentinians as our South America correspondent Katie Watson now reports.
*11:50.480- 11:55.460* :  In Buenos Aires, Aveda still looms large. Her image towers over one of the city's biggest
*11:55.460- 12:01.360* :  streets and her name is echoed everywhere. The country's most famous politician and the
*12:01.360- 12:06.780* :  original champion of the poor is missed by many, especially in these days of economic hardship.
*12:07.400- 12:12.120* :  The two remaining candidates are promising the world when it comes to improving an economy on its
*12:14.960- 12:20.020* :  knees. But in Isla, Maciel, one of Buenos Aires's poorest neighbourhood that sits in the shadow of
*12:20.020- 12:25.880* :  the country's largest port, it's hard to muster enthusiasm for feels like endless broken promises.
*12:29.180- 12:34.340* :  Lord Les Monkeys runs a corner shop with her daughters. She says soaring inflation means paying
*12:34.340- 12:40.180* :  for the basics is an increasing struggle for her customers. With annual inflation now above 140
*12:40.220- 12:44.700* :  percent, money becomes worthless quickly and people here want change.
*12:49.760- 12:54.960* :  We can't get to the end of the month. I personally have a little notebook of people who
*12:54.960- 13:01.460* :  can't make ends meet and I give them items on credit. They can never pay it back because they pay
*13:01.460- 13:05.600* :  me back and then they end up all win again. So it's a vicious cycle.
*13:09.940- 13:14.520* :  The candidates know this all too well. The economy is the number one thing that everyone wants
*13:14.520- 13:20.600* :  fixing and the Argentinians have a choice. Leftist Sergio Massa, the current economy minister,
*13:21.000- 13:26.940* :  and part of the political establishment, or radical heavy melee, a total outsider who's proposed
*13:26.940- 13:31.560* :  drastic changes like blowing up the central bank or introducing the dollar.
*13:34.480- 13:39.220* :  The two candidates can be further apart politically as they showed in their final debate.
*13:39.820- 13:45.000* :  If you prefer inflation, ask yourself if you prefer inflation of our stability.
*13:45.500- 13:50.000* :  If you want to continue supporting this corrupt parasitic and useless political caste,
*13:50.480- 13:54.800* :  it just destroys our wealth generation and sinks us deeper and deeper.
*13:57.420- 14:02.220* :  Having amazed proposals which also include more liberal gun laws and banning abortion
*14:02.220- 14:08.100* :  make many people nervous and that's something Sergio Massa is trying to use to his advantage.
*14:11.800- 14:17.220* :  I know there are some who are voting for me not because they are convinced, but just as a way to
*14:17.220- 14:23.920* :  avoid choosing a path of violence, hatred and harm. And I want to tell all of them that I will
*14:23.920- 14:29.700* :  ensure they feel that they didn't throw away their vote but that they trusted someone.
*14:31.500- 14:37.020* :  The political style of heavy melee has captured attention. He's been likened to Donald Trump
*14:37.020- 14:40.260* :  and closer to home, Brazil's former leader, Jai Bolsonaro.
*14:42.980- 14:46.520* :  Back at the port was a group of young teenagers kicking around a ball in the street
*14:47.000- 14:49.200* :  in the distance the stacks of shipping containers.
*14:52.400- 14:57.000* :  Several of the teenagers are wearing t-shirts with the name of the country's most famous footballer,
*14:57.180- 15:02.180* :  Messi. With such little faith that politicians will change anything to the average Argentinian,
*15:02.700- 15:05.360* :  it feels safer to back sporting heroes instead.
*15:07.600- 15:09.860* :  Our South America correspondent Katie Watson.
*15:10.820- 15:16.240* :  The second hand book kiosks that line the banks of the river Sen are a Paris institution,
*15:16.240- 15:20.800* :  but plans to move the stalls ahead of the opening ceremony of the Olympics next year
*15:21.180- 15:25.940* :  have caused anger. The authorities in the French capital say the kiosks must be taken down as a
*15:25.940- 15:29.920* :  security measure. Are your regional editor Danny Eberhard has the details?
*15:29.980- 15:36.840* :  The Sen, it was once famously said, is the only river in the world that runs between two bookshelves.
*15:37.240- 15:41.500* :  Browseeing the stalls on its banks has been a pleasure for Parisians and tourists alike
*15:41.500- 15:46.460* :  since the 19th century, but the river is to be the set for a strikingly innovative
*15:46.460- 15:51.580* :  Olympics opening ceremony, with thousands of athletes processing in boats past the crowds.
*15:51.820- 15:56.840* :  The authorities fear the dark green book kiosks could be used to stage a bomb attack.
*15:56.940- 16:03.300* :  Four kiosks were hoisted up by crane and moved before being reinstated in a trial run yesterday.
*16:04.000- 16:07.560* :  Michel Boutard from the Cultural Association of booksellers of Paris
*16:07.560- 16:14.460* :  likened it to extracting a tooth. It was, he said, something even Nazi occupation had failed to do.
*16:14.800- 16:20.720* :  The floods of 1910, the occupation, even the Polian III, didn't manage to do what the
*16:20.720- 16:26.400* :  Olympic Games may succeed in doing. In other words, make us disappear. And that's it.
*16:26.540- 16:31.800* :  The booksellers fear damage to their livelihoods. They're appealing to President Macaron to
*16:31.800- 16:37.440* :  halt what they call a stupid and unnecessary plan. Are your regional editor Danny Eberhard?
*16:40.120- 16:42.220* :  And still to come on the global news podcast?
*16:42.220- 16:48.680* :  Before we raise $100,000, that will be $10 million of medical debt that has cancelled out.
*16:49.120- 16:54.400* :  How a young mother in New York City who died of cancer has helped pay off millions of dollars
*16:54.400- 16:56.400* :  of other patient's medical debts.
*17:02.100- 17:06.020* :  Picture the scene. You're 12 years old, a talented ice hockey player,

*18:08.120- 18:09.780* :  This counts not available in our safe and situations.
*18:15.900- 18:22.180* :  Space news now and Elon Musk's huge new rocket starship has left the launch pad for a second time.
*18:34.500- 18:40.080* :  The first test launch ended after four minutes when the rocket blew up. Was this one any more
*18:40.080- 18:43.300* :  successful? I asked our science correspondent Jonathan Amos.
*18:43.660- 18:49.280* :  I think they will class it as a success. It got further and it got higher than it did last time.
*18:49.280- 18:53.880* :  If you go back to April when they did this debut flight, I mean it was drama from the off.
*18:54.000- 18:58.780* :  There were engines that were shutting down. It ended up doing a loop the loop in the sky and
*18:58.780- 19:06.040* :  tearing itself apart. This time it looked like a normal launch. It got off the ground. All the
*19:06.040- 19:11.700* :  engines were firing in unison. It got to this key phase, which they call stage separation.
*19:11.700- 19:17.580* :  So in rocketry what happens is you use a big booster on the bottom that gets you off the ground.
*19:17.580- 19:23.640* :  You expend it's propellant and then you drop it and you carry on with in this case the ship as
*19:23.640- 19:29.600* :  they call it the top part. Now that all worked perfectly. Things went slightly right after that,
*19:29.600- 19:36.660* :  but up until that point it was looking really really good. So I think Elon Musk was looking at 60%
*19:36.660- 19:43.200* :  success. I think he got 60% success today. And so what happens next? Try again. Oh yeah. I mean
*19:43.200- 19:49.900* :  they've got a production line of these rockets in Boca Chica on the Mexico border with Texas.
*19:50.460- 19:56.220* :  So they have, I don't know how many vehicles, but a few almost ready to go. So what you're going
*19:56.220- 20:01.900* :  to see now is these launches coming thick and fast. Pending permissions from various federal
*20:01.900- 20:07.540* :  agencies that do all the licensing and they need to get something of a move on as well. There's
*20:07.540- 20:13.600* :  few reasons for that. One is Elon Musk really needs this rocket for his other businesses. You know
*20:13.600- 20:18.840* :  he's building an internet constellation in the skies that's called Starlink with these satellites.
*20:18.840- 20:24.760* :  There's thousands up there. The new satellites are bigger and heavier. He needs a bigger rocket.
*20:25.080- 20:31.280* :  Starship is that rocket. Also NASA, the US Space Agency wants to use a version of this rocket to
*20:31.280- 20:36.940* :  land people on the moon. It's going back to the moon. Fifty years after Apollo 17, the last time
*20:36.940- 20:42.460* :  we were there, they're going back later this decade and they want to use Starship as the system
*20:42.500- 20:47.920* :  that gets them down to the lunar surface. So there's a bit of a clock ticking. But they're stepping
*20:47.920- 20:52.740* :  through it. That's the point. You know you test early, you break it and they quite often do with
*20:52.740- 20:57.080* :  SpaceX and then you learn and you come back and you do it better. And I think they've done that
*20:57.100- 21:03.320* :  today. Jonathan Amos, science correspondent. The Sudanese Army and the rival paramilitary
*21:03.320- 21:09.360* :  RSF have accused each other of damaging a dam on the River Nile, 40 kilometres south of the capital
*21:09.360- 21:14.420* :  Khartoum. There appears it could cause major flooding. Here's our Africa Regional Editor Richard
*21:14.420- 21:19.580* :  Hamilton. It's not clear who's responsible for the damage to the Jebel Aulier dam,
*21:19.580- 21:26.260* :  but it lies near a Sudanese air force base which provides a strategic southern entrance to the
*21:26.260- 21:32.900* :  capital. Both sides have claimed to have control of that base. This time last week the army and
*21:32.900- 21:39.160* :  the RSF blamed each other for blowing up the Shambat bridge in Khartoum. Neither side seems
*21:39.160- 21:45.260* :  worried about the impact such destruction has on the civilian population, who's suffering is
*21:45.260- 21:52.460* :  getting worse. The UN estimates that more than 25 million Sudanese are in need of humanitarian
*21:53.260- 21:59.560* :  assistance. Richard Hamilton. Residents of the Indian capital, Delhi, often face toxic air pollution
*21:59.560- 22:05.020* :  that may be knocking years off their lives. Much of the city of more than 30 million people has
*22:05.020- 22:10.280* :  been blanketed with smog this month, with the air quality earning Delhi the dubious distinction
*22:10.280- 22:15.280* :  of being the most polluted city in the world this week. Our South Asia correspondent,
*22:15.280- 22:22.060* :  Samira Hussein, reports from Delhi. Walking just near the Indian gate, it's almost 7am.
*22:22.060- 22:29.500* :  To just give you a sense of what this toxic smog looks like, imagine you're waking up early morning
*22:29.500- 22:34.500* :  near a lake and that kind of mist that you see. That's exactly what it looks like, but it's not
*22:34.500- 22:41.500* :  water particles. It's actually really harmful, tiny particulates that get right into your lungs.
*22:41.540- 22:47.820* :  It's dangerous for people to be outside for long periods of time. Here are some people that are
*22:47.820- 22:52.020* :  out for their worded walks. Let me ask them some questions. Good morning, sir. You're not worried
*22:52.020- 22:58.140* :  about the pollution. There's no other way for us. Either we should sit in our house for next two
*22:58.140- 23:03.420* :  months or so because till the time enters there, it'll continue. Often this time of year, pollution
*23:03.420- 23:10.080* :  levels in Delhi get really high and it's for a bunch of reasons. One, in neighboring states, you
*23:10.080- 23:17.400* :  have farmers that are burning off their residual crop. That air comes and blankets over Delhi.
*23:18.020- 23:24.300* :  It's also getting kind of cold and so it traps the polluted air over the city and there's
*23:24.340- 23:30.860* :  fair little wind to dissipate that pollution. What's made it worse in the last couple of days is
*23:30.900- 23:37.980* :  the Diwali celebrations. People were celebrating the Hindu festival of lights using firecrackers
*23:38.220- 23:42.640* :  and that contributed quite significantly to the current pollution levels.
*23:44.180- 23:49.460* :  So I'm at the Center for Science and Environment. It's a new Delhi-based think tank.
*23:49.900- 23:53.300* :  And let me hear to speak with the executive director, Agamita Roy-Jodhri.
*23:53.640- 23:59.820* :  There are actually no short-term answers for sustained improvement in air quality. When you have
*23:59.820- 24:05.620* :  this kind of smog episode, you take emergency action. All that you can do through emergency action
*24:05.620- 24:12.580* :  is not to load more. Otherwise, for us to really clean up the air, you really need more sustained
*24:12.580- 24:21.120* :  action at infrastructure and system level. Some of the emergency action that's being put in place
*24:21.120- 24:26.840* :  includes things like halting all construction projects and preventing diesel trucks from entering
*24:26.840- 24:32.820* :  the city. But for some, it's real piecemeal solutions for a problem that affects absolutely
*24:33.360- 24:38.380* :  everyone that lives in Delhi. November is what was supposed to be one of the best months.
*24:39.240- 24:46.120* :  It used to be such lovely weather. And now it sucks, it's depressing, you know. And it's every year,
*24:46.120- 24:52.700* :  year after year, it's the same thing. But Roy-Jodhri remains hopeful because people at least are
*24:52.700- 24:58.840* :  talking about the problem. What is really interesting now in Delhi at least, that conversation around
*24:58.840- 25:05.640* :  to air pollution has really turned. I mean, today air pollution is really a conversation in
*25:05.640- 25:11.380* :  everyone's drawing room. And that report from Delhi by our South Asia correspondent Samira has
*25:11.380- 25:18.680* :  seen. It's been doling out advice for more than 250 years, but now the Etiquette Guide Depretts
*25:18.680- 25:25.600* :  has set out the correct way to use mobile phones. It lists 10 rules to follow when making a call,
*25:25.600- 25:30.400* :  including advice to send a text first. Greg McKenzie has the details.
*25:30.920- 25:36.140* :  Depretts Etiquette is an unrivaled guide to protocol and modern manners offering information
*25:36.140- 25:41.520* :  about addressing royalty. People with titles as well as advice on correspondence, rights of
*25:41.520- 25:46.920* :  passage, business etiquette and also international etiquette. They've now issued their 10
*25:46.920- 25:53.720* :  commandments of mobile etiquette, which also warns people from having loud phone calls in public.
*25:53.720- 25:59.020* :  The first rule reads, it's increasingly the norm to text before you call and ask the
*25:59.020- 26:03.480* :  recipient if they're free to answer your call immediately or arrange a time to speak.
*26:03.480- 26:08.220* :  Secondly, the guide suggests another expect an unannounced social call to be answered,
*26:08.220- 26:12.900* :  unless you're calling someone from an older generation. Business calls are a different matter
*26:13.220- 26:18.120* :  and are likely to be answered with much more willingness. But if you do call and don't get an answer,
*26:18.120- 26:22.920* :  don't call again the Brett says. The 10 commandments of phone etiquette,
*26:22.920- 26:28.520* :  calling to the Brett's, are one, text before calling, two, if no answer, send the text.
*26:28.520- 26:35.420* :  Three, don't repeatedly call unless an emergency. Four, don't leave a voicemail. Five, be aware
*26:35.420- 26:42.200* :  people may find unsolicited calls alarming. Other suggestions on the list include a warning
*26:42.200- 26:48.880* :  that it's important to send condolences and of make a call. Now ahead of the King's coronation
*26:48.880- 26:54.480* :  earlier this year, the famed etiquette guidebook revised its guidance, putting particular emphasis
*26:54.480- 27:02.560* :  on technology etiquette. The handbook created in 1769 now has pages on the rules for texting,
*27:02.560- 27:08.740* :  emojis and bizarrely how to announce your engagements on X, formerly Twitter. Greg McKenzie.
*27:09.720- 27:14.980* :  A young mother in New York City who died of a variant cancer has helped raise enough money to
*27:14.980- 27:20.640* :  pay off millions of dollars in other people's medical debts. Casey McIntyre started treatment for
*27:20.640- 27:27.400* :  the disease in 2019 and has now died at home. Her fundraiser is going up every hour. David Lewis
*27:27.400- 27:33.520* :  is following the story. If you're reading this, I've passed away. That was Casey McIntyre's final
*27:33.520- 27:39.480* :  post on social media and the message went on. I loved each and every one of you with my whole
*27:39.480- 27:45.860* :  heart and I promise you I knew how deeply I was loved. To celebrate my life, I've arranged to
*27:45.860- 27:52.380* :  buy up others medical debt and then destroy the debt. The mother of one's fundraising page has
*27:52.380- 27:59.480* :  so far raised over $170,000, meaning thousands of people may be in line for financial help.
*27:59.480- 28:05.880* :  The strategy is simple. For every penny her charity appeal raises a non-profit organization
*28:05.880- 28:12.620* :  RIP medical pays off a dollar of debt. That means more than $17 million in medical money
*28:12.620- 28:19.320* :  owed has been erased and that figure is continuing to rise. How is it possible? Well RIP medical
*28:19.320- 28:25.300* :  buys bundles of debt worth millions for a fraction of the outstanding price. Medical debt is
*28:25.300- 28:31.280* :  a major issue in the US. Nearly 70 percent of American adults say they've received hospital bills
*28:31.280- 28:36.760* :  they can't afford. That means up to 100 million people struggle with doctors bills
*28:36.760- 28:43.200* :  according to the health research organization KFF. Miss McIntyre's husband Andrew Rose Gregory
*28:43.200- 28:49.120* :  who's helped publicize the pledge drive told our partner station CBS they spent some amazing
*28:49.140- 28:55.120* :  times together despite the progress of her illness. Fantastic summer where we were at the beach
*28:55.760- 29:00.380* :  we were at the river we were fishing we were playing with our daughter. The chemotherapy
*29:00.380- 29:05.580* :  monthly or chemotherapy eventually weekly you're doing rehab after surgery she went through a lot.
*29:05.680- 29:11.040* :  The family have now announced that next month there will be a memorial service debt Jubilee
*29:11.460- 29:17.560* :  combining a celebration of Casey's life and anonymously buying up and thereby cancelling other
*29:17.560- 29:21.880* :  people's outstanding medical credit. That report by David Lewis.
*29:24.860- 29:29.500* :  And that's all from us for now but the global news podcast will be back at the same time tomorrow.
