*00:00.060- 00:05.560* :  Hello, this is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service, with reports and analysis
*00:05.560- 00:12.560* :  from across the world, the latest news seven days a week. BBC World Service podcasts are supported by advertising.
*00:16.860- 00:21.180* :  I'm Simon Jack. And I'm Zing Sing. And this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*00:21.440- 00:25.260* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*00:25.260- 00:32.120* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*00:32.120- 00:37.460* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*00:37.460- 00:43.640* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner, but controversially turned against the players
*00:44.160- 00:48.160* :  when Cisnik as well. So is he good, bad or just another billionaire?
*00:48.420- 00:51.840* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*00:57.820- 01:00.380* :  Wait, so you said you genetically engineered yourself?
*01:00.500- 01:05.660* :  I put a foreign piece of DNA inside my cells. Wow!
*01:06.240- 01:10.400* :  Crowdscience is the podcast that takes your questions about life and the world around us
*01:10.540- 01:14.680* :  and goes in search of the answers. What happens to bugs during the winter?
*01:14.680- 01:19.360* :  Oh, as a wasp in there, yeah. Just search for Crowdscience wherever you found this podcast.
*01:20.460- 01:22.980* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*01:24.880- 01:26.820* :  I'm Nick Miles and in the early hours of Tuesday,
*01:26.820- 01:29.000* :  the 14th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:29.640- 01:32.060* :  Concerns are growing over hospitals in Gaza.
*01:32.520- 01:35.340* :  Dozens of premature babies are among those in danger.
*01:35.780- 01:39.780* :  Israel says Hamas is using hospitals as cover for its command centres.
*01:41.740- 01:47.320* :  Also in this podcast, Donald Trump's son returns to the witness stand in the family fraud trial
*01:47.760- 01:51.520* :  and the book that's so difficult to understand, it can take decades to read.
*01:52.220- 01:56.860* :  It's so dense at times that you want to take the time to suss it out.
*01:57.140- 02:03.760* :  How it makes you feel? What choice may or may not be probing or hooking up?
*02:04.460- 02:05.780* :  We'll reveal all later.
*02:09.420- 02:15.360* :  The World Health Organization says Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, is fast becoming a cemetery
*02:15.360- 02:20.640* :  with bodies piling up inside and outside. The building has no power and
*02:20.640- 02:25.400* :  there's fierce fighting all around. Hamas health officials say there are now no functioning
*02:25.400- 02:30.560* :  hospitals in northern Gaza. A correspondent in Jerusalem, Nick Beak, sent this report,
*02:30.900- 02:32.720* :  some of which she may find distressing.
*02:37.500- 02:41.020* :  There was chaos at NASA Hospital near the city of Karniunis today,
*02:41.540- 02:46.520* :  as stretchers carrying the injured from Israel's latest bombing raids were raced into the walls.
*02:48.580- 02:54.180* :  Doctors tried to examine the blood soaked hand of a baby, while medics at the next bed cut away
*02:54.180- 02:59.960* :  the clothes from another child and began urgent treatment. All this is happening in southern Gaza.
*03:00.680- 03:05.100* :  In the north of Gaza, the situation at Al-Shifa, the territory's largest hospital,
*03:05.560- 03:11.040* :  is said to have deteriorated even further. Medics say there are piles of bodies outside the main
*03:11.040- 03:16.680* :  entrance and the injured cannot be brought in for treatment because rescuers fear they too will
*03:16.680- 03:23.400* :  be shot. Israel claims Hamas has a control center under the hospital, a claim Hamas and doctors
*03:23.400- 03:28.700* :  have denied. One medic who asked not to be named sent the BBC this update.
*03:31.640- 03:37.260* :  There is no food to provide for the people here. As medical teams, we can bear the suffering,
*03:37.260- 03:44.500* :  but there are 15,000 people here where half of them are children. There is no food or water.
*03:44.840- 03:49.960* :  People risk their lives and go out in search of food or water for their children.
*03:50.700- 03:54.860* :  The situation here is very tragic. There is extreme concern for the more than
*03:54.860- 04:00.660* :  13 newborn babies at Al-Shifa, now that their neonatal intensive care unit has lost power.
*04:01.240- 04:06.740* :  One source inside the hospital has told the BBC that seven of the babies have now died.
*04:07.700- 04:12.420* :  Israel denies it is firing on the hospital and insists there is a safe route
*04:12.780- 04:16.500* :  for medical staff, patients and civilians to leave the buildings.
*04:18.660- 04:23.360* :  Doctors say the intensity of the Israeli operation has left other hospitals in northern
*04:23.360- 04:28.960* :  Gaza without power and at breaking point. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asserted
*04:28.960- 04:33.760* :  that accelerating the military campaign will bring about the eradication of Hamas quicker
*04:34.340- 04:39.080* :  and help bring home the estimated 240 hostages still being held.
*04:39.780- 04:44.900* :  Families of those kidnapped are protesting this evening once again, saying the release of their
*04:44.900- 04:48.640* :  loved ones should be the priority, not the ground operation.
*04:48.640- 04:53.660* :  I was Nick Beak. Well, Mark Regga, the senior adviser to Israel's Prime Minister.
*04:54.200- 04:59.860* :  Matthew and Rolliwala asked him what he was going to do to help the babies at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza.
*05:00.780- 05:05.640* :  We bought fuel, especially for the babies, for the incubators because obviously
*05:06.240- 05:11.540* :  no one wants to see these babies in any way come into harm. We've also said we will approve
*05:11.540- 05:16.080* :  their departure to another hospital in ambulances and that can be facilitated too.
*05:16.980- 05:20.760* :  But I'm not sure that Hamas is interested in any of these solutions. They want pictures.
*05:20.760- 05:25.660* :  They want pictures to show a crisis so there'll be pressure on Israel to cease our operation.
*05:25.720- 05:31.480* :  That's their game plan. You blame Hamas, but you'll know that the 300 litres of fuel that you've
*05:31.480- 05:36.100* :  delivered, what the doctors are saying, that would last for half an hour, one hour, the UN have been
*05:36.100- 05:42.460* :  saying for weeks now that this would be the consequences of fuel being cut off. But that image
*05:42.460- 05:49.280* :  that has gone around the world, it is absolutely harrowing of babies just swaddled, not in incubators.
*05:49.280- 05:54.700* :  It is absolutely harrowing. You can talk about military operations, you can talk about objectives,
*05:55.480- 05:59.780* :  but that is the reality on the ground, isn't it? And you have to take responsibility for what
*05:59.780- 06:05.260* :  you are doing as well, don't you? Well, let's be clear, who has turned the hospital into a war zone?
*06:06.080- 06:10.840* :  Hamas, who have deliberately built their military infrastructure under the hospital,
*06:10.840- 06:15.080* :  a network of tunnels that connects from their headquarters under the hospital,
*06:15.540- 06:20.100* :  a network of tunnels that goes for mile after mile and includes rocket launching sites,
*06:20.560- 06:26.800* :  arms depots, their fortresses, their underground fortresses, this is Hamas' military machine that
*06:26.800- 06:31.900* :  they have deliberately built under hospital. Now, we're not targeting the hospital. We're trying to
*06:31.900- 06:36.980* :  do our best to safeguard everyone in it. But if anyone is held responsible for any harm that comes
*06:36.980- 06:42.400* :  to those children, it is Hamas who have against all the laws of armed conflict, use those babies
*06:42.400- 06:46.780* :  to shield its military machine. Sure, but you have to take responsibility for what you're doing.
*06:46.780- 06:52.060* :  Let me just read a quote because it expressly references what you're talking about. It's from
*06:52.060- 06:58.020* :  the UN's humanitarian chief Volkerturk who last week said, any use by Palestinian armed groups
*06:58.020- 07:04.100* :  of civilians and civilian objects to shield themselves from attacks is a contravation of the
*07:04.100- 07:09.040* :  laws of war. But such contact by Palestinian armed groups has not absolved Israel,
*07:09.440- 07:13.440* :  if it's obligation to ensure that civilians are spared, that the principles of distinction,
*07:14.180- 07:19.600* :  precautions in attack and proportionality are respected. Failure to do so is also a contravention
*07:19.980- 07:25.860* :  of laws of war. So those areas, distinction, precautions, proportionality, they are all being
*07:25.860- 07:30.560* :  questioned in terms of what you are responsible for. But they shouldn't be because I would argue
*07:30.560- 07:35.700* :  that Israel has been very strong in observing all the laws of war. We've been urging people to
*07:35.700- 07:41.380* :  leave the area of combat now for over three weeks. And actually, literally hundreds and thousands
*07:41.380- 07:45.700* :  of Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip have voted with their feet and relocated to the south.
*07:45.780- 07:49.620* :  Sure, and you know that many can't as well. No, but when you say they can't,
*07:50.000- 07:54.400* :  is it because Hamas is preventing them to do so? How is it that just in the last few days
*07:54.400- 07:58.860* :  when Hamas's power in the north has been challenged by the presence of Israeli combat troops?
*07:58.860- 08:03.480* :  Suddenly, we've got 150,000 people over the last three days who have also left with someone
*08:03.480- 08:09.100* :  preventing them from leaving up until now. You said that Hamas have centers and command posts
*08:09.100- 08:14.720* :  underneath those hospitals. You were also saying that you're not directly targeting hospitals.
*08:14.780- 08:20.220* :  How can both things be true? Because we know that you're firing and concentrating around
*08:20.340- 08:26.940* :  the hospitals. If those command posts underneath the hospitals, how can it be true that you're not
*08:26.940- 08:31.300* :  directly targeting them? We're doing our best in a very difficult combat situation to be a
*08:31.300- 08:36.700* :  surgical, as is humanly possible. But we don't target hospitals. We don't target patients in
*08:36.700- 08:41.300* :  hospitals. We don't target medical crews. But what is the problem? If you talk about El Shifa,
*08:41.300- 08:47.380* :  the director of the hospital, is a Hamas appointed bureaucrat. And as a Hamas appointed person,
*08:47.380- 08:52.300* :  who is his first loyalty to? And so when we are coming with practical solutions to try to solve
*08:52.300- 08:57.100* :  the issue of these children, of these babies or incubators, everything we've proposed is thrown
*08:57.100- 09:01.080* :  out the window. They don't take the fuel that was offered for their generators. They don't support
*09:01.080- 09:05.840* :  the movement of the babies out in ambulances. So of course, they're stuck there because they want
*09:05.840- 09:13.060* :  those terrible photographs. Hamas wants those babies to die to save its military machine. That's
*09:13.060- 09:20.440* :  what I see. Mark Regev. Six weeks into Donald Trump's fraud trial in New York, and today it was
*09:20.440- 09:25.260* :  the turn of the former president's lawyers to begin making their case. The stakes couldn't be much
*09:25.260- 09:30.160* :  higher. If the prosecution gets its way, the Trump organization could be barred from ever again
*09:30.160- 09:35.080* :  operating in New York state and face a find of at least a quarter of a billion dollars.
*09:35.080- 09:39.320* :  First up for the defense, the former president's older son, Donald Jr.
*09:40.060- 09:44.340* :  Our New York correspondent, Netta Fick, was watching proceedings and spoke to my colleague, Tim
*09:44.340- 09:50.580* :  Franks. What was just so striking was how much they really focused on this defense claim
*09:50.580- 09:56.240* :  that the Trump properties were extremely valuable. And if anything, they were undervalued in those
*09:56.240- 10:01.360* :  financial statements that the judge has already ruled were fraudulent. So Donald Trump Jr.
*10:01.360- 10:07.000* :  was really given the leeway under defense questioning to talk at length about these properties.
*10:07.580- 10:12.460* :  The defense put up a PowerPoint presentation that was put together by the Trump organization's
*10:12.460- 10:18.220* :  marketing team. And he spent the entire morning and part of the afternoon just meticulously going
*10:18.220- 10:24.100* :  through talking about the Central Park view at Trump Tower. The vaults inside Forty Wall Street,
*10:24.100- 10:29.780* :  how Mar-a-Lago was an American castle on land that was unseen between an ocean and a lake.
*10:29.780- 10:34.760* :  It was just this type of bragging and boasting about these properties that were so used to
*10:34.760- 10:39.340* :  hearing from his father. But they really didn't touch on any of the other kind of key defense
*10:39.340- 10:45.440* :  arguments or at all on the financial statements themselves. It was really much just this attempt
*10:45.880- 10:48.980* :  to really bolster his father as this real estate genius.
*10:49.300- 10:56.580* :  Right. And the judges had pretty testy relations with especially Donald J. Trump, the dad.
*10:57.280- 11:02.320* :  I mean, he's expressed impatience in the past about sort of stuff going off
*11:02.800- 11:06.980* :  pieced, as it were, that stuff that he doesn't think is relevant to the case. What was his
*11:06.980- 11:12.840* :  attitude today? You know, he was joking around with Don Jr. at points. Don Jr. saying how, you
*11:12.840- 11:16.680* :  know, he's the only non-Golfer in the family and the judge being amused by that. But otherwise,
*11:16.700- 11:23.180* :  he has really let the defense take their time. At one point, the prosecution objected,
*11:23.540- 11:27.540* :  saying he was just taking too long. And he said, let him speak about how great the Trump
*11:27.540- 11:32.280* :  organization is. And I think what you're seeing here is the judge is very conscious that the
*11:32.280- 11:38.060* :  defense has tried to paint him as biased. He has said point blank in court that he doesn't want
*11:38.060- 11:43.640* :  this case to be reversed on appeal. And so the judge has let him speak at length. He hasn't
*11:43.640- 11:47.580* :  interrupted, except for a few times to say, you know, if you're going to say again, maybe you
*11:47.580- 11:52.720* :  don't need to repeat yourself so often. But otherwise, he is very conscious of this claim against him
*11:52.720- 11:59.120* :  that he's biased. I'm wondering what you think or legal experts think the defense need to do,
*11:59.120- 12:04.940* :  because all the testimony that I've read and the analysis I've read suggests that the witnesses,
*12:05.320- 12:10.800* :  in particular, the Trump family, and in particular Donald Trump himself, didn't do his case of
*12:10.800- 12:17.040* :  huge deal of favor when the prosecution were examining him. So what's the sense of the job
*12:17.040- 12:21.980* :  that the defense have in front of them? Yeah, you know, and I think another point that was made was
*12:22.260- 12:27.300* :  one of the reasons Donald Trump did kind of go into attack mode on the stand was because he has
*12:28.040- 12:32.760* :  really resigned himself, I think, to the fact that he has lost this case. I mean, we already know
*12:32.760- 12:36.960* :  he lost the heart of it with the judge ruling the statements were fraudulent. I think what they're
*12:36.960- 12:43.340* :  really trying to focus on now is that the family didn't intentionally do anything wrong that they
*12:43.340- 12:49.020* :  really do feel the bank would have given them this loan regardless. So we expect the prosecution to
*12:49.020- 12:54.240* :  try to put up expert witnesses. They call them expert witnesses on accounting and valuations.
*12:54.320- 12:58.700* :  They're going to try to convince the judge that as Donald Trump said, these statements had a
*12:58.700- 13:03.460* :  worthless clause. The banks didn't rely on them. We already heard from Deutsche Bank that they
*13:03.460- 13:07.780* :  didn't do their own due diligence, even though they shaved off some of the valuation of those
*13:07.780- 13:12.800* :  properties. But that's going to be what I think the defense really wants to put forward to the judge.
*13:13.380- 13:19.480* :  Neutrophic. Rescuers in Northern India have used two way radios to make contact with 40
*13:19.480- 13:24.740* :  construction workers who were trapped in a tunnel which collapsed. Police in the Himalayan state of
*13:24.740- 13:30.020* :  Utorakan say the men are safe and heavy machinery is being used to remove the rubble.
*13:30.520- 13:33.740* :  Our South Asia correspondent Samira Hussein reports from Delhi.
*13:34.540- 13:38.440* :  The collapse happened yesterday morning when heavy debris from a nearby landslide
*13:38.440- 13:43.960* :  fell onto the tunnel, trapping the workers. By last night, officials were able to make contact
*13:43.960- 13:50.120* :  with the trapped workers and have sent down dry food rations and water while also pumping oxygen
*13:50.120- 13:56.020* :  into the tunnel. Now the challenge is getting them out. Efforts have been slow as emergency workers
*13:56.020- 14:01.100* :  have to contend with falling mud and debris as they dig towards the trapped workers.
*14:01.720- 14:06.780* :  Officials have not given a timeline for when they may be rescued. The laborers were working on
*14:06.780- 14:12.620* :  the Silkeara tunnel in the northern state of Utorakan. It is an ambitious project by the federal
*14:12.620- 14:17.880* :  government to connect some of India's most popular Hindu shrines. Samira Hussein.
*14:19.100- 14:24.660* :  South Africa is set to be the first African country to introduce shared parental leave after a
*14:24.660- 14:29.940* :  high court decided that both parents have the right to time off after having or adopting a child.
*14:29.940- 14:35.180* :  In the past, mothers were entitled the four months leave whilst fathers and partners were
*14:35.180- 14:40.660* :  only allowed a maximum of 10 days. This ruling will give the parents a choice on how they divide
*14:40.660- 14:45.620* :  four months parental leave between themselves. Rob Young spoke to Vessel van den Berg,
*14:45.620- 14:51.200* :  who runs a group called Mencare, which has been campaigning for shared parental leave for over a
*14:51.200- 14:57.060* :  decade. What we've seen in other countries is that when shared leave is available,
*14:57.060- 15:03.800* :  usually the father is unlikely to take the leave initially and often passes most of the leave
*15:03.800- 15:11.440* :  to the mother. So how this could work is that if both parents can decide together they can then
*15:11.440- 15:17.460* :  take ideally, eventually half of the leave available to both. But what we've been calling for
*15:17.460- 15:24.000* :  from the main care campaign is that a portion of non transferable leave is added to the shared
*15:24.000- 15:29.440* :  leave that is now being offered. And that has been shown in countries like Spain or Sweden
*15:29.440- 15:35.320* :  to actually nudge fathers to take more of the shared leave portion as well. Right, so you'd like
*15:35.320- 15:39.580* :  South Africa to go further than you want them to enhance the leave that they're planning to offer.
*15:40.120- 15:44.640* :  Absolutely. It's a major leap forward for us and we're the first country in Africa to offer
*15:44.640- 15:50.280* :  such a substantial portion of leave to fathers. But what we've been hearing from women's rights
*15:50.280- 15:55.180* :  groups is that, you know, this would cut into maternity leave so it would take time away from
*15:55.180- 16:00.180* :  others. And what we've seen from our evidence from what we've been gathering as Equipmento
*16:00.180- 16:05.500* :  and the main care campaign is that other countries actually show us that fathers are unlikely
*16:05.500- 16:10.940* :  to take as much leave as available unless they are incentives. And this is paid that you've
*16:11.060- 16:15.920* :  visited. So we'll rely on companies being able to afford this as well. What is your assessment
*16:15.920- 16:21.220* :  of whether companies will be able to afford this? Well, what we've seen is that this actually over
*16:21.220- 16:26.580* :  the long term with data from the international labour organisation, there is a return on investment,
*16:26.580- 16:32.960* :  particularly for companies who are able to implement leave in a way that encourages retention.
*16:33.020- 16:38.500* :  We will see that employees actually stay with the companies longer term. So for example,
*16:38.500- 16:44.240* :  companies in the financial sector or companies in the IT sector, their technology sector,
*16:44.740- 16:50.340* :  talent is really important and retaining talent becomes a cost saving measure over time.
*16:50.340- 16:56.980* :  So offering benefits like leave therefore retains talent over the long term which introduces
*16:57.380- 17:02.400* :  cost savings. An awful lot of South Africans, several million of them work in the,
*17:02.400- 17:06.820* :  what is called the informal sector. So effectively don't get a paycheck but do earn money
*17:06.820- 17:11.660* :  some way and therefore they won't be able to benefit from this will they? Well, in South Africa,
*17:12.200- 17:19.140* :  employees will benefit from a state payment to support this time. So therefore they will be able
*17:19.140- 17:25.160* :  to have time off. And what we are seeing, you're saying people who aren't in employment but work
*17:25.160- 17:31.480* :  informally will be able to benefit? Yes, we are seeing increasingly protection of people in the
*17:31.480- 17:37.420* :  informal sector around the world, including in South Africa. Vessel Vandenberg.
*17:40.460- 17:46.120* :  Still to come. I heard a lot about him growing up and he played a massive part in the rebuilding
*17:46.120- 17:54.620* :  of this club. So what it is today? Player, director, stop going. Fans bid a final farewell to Manchester United
*17:54.980- 18:06.860* :  and English footballing legend Bobby Charlton. How do we navigate in space? Are humans naturally
*18:06.860- 18:12.440* :  clean and tidy? What exactly is this quantum computer? Can smell and hence your appetite?
*18:12.640- 18:17.520* :  Crowd science is the podcast that takes your science questions and goes in search of the answers.
*18:17.520- 18:23.080* :  My question for crowd science is are artistic brains different? Stick with me because there have been
*18:23.080- 18:27.440* :  some really fascinating research into this. That's crowd science from the BBC World Service.
*18:27.600- 18:31.740* :  I love this question. Just search for crowd science wherever you found this podcast.

*19:13.400- 19:18.300* :  our podcast Good Bad Billionaire, we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first
*19:18.300- 19:24.220* :  athlete billionaire. Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100
*19:24.220- 19:29.440* :  million playing basketball. But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His
*19:29.440- 19:35.460* :  air Jordan range is worth billions. And he made his real money as an NBA team owner. But
*19:35.460- 19:41.760* :  controversially turned against the players when Cisnik as well. So is he good bad or just another
*19:41.760- 19:45.940* :  billionaire? To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*19:54.400- 19:59.580* :  In Brazil, President Luis Ignacio Lula de Silva has increased the number of places reserved
*19:59.580- 20:05.020* :  at public universities for seasons of African or indigenous descent for people with disability
*20:05.020- 20:11.860* :  or for lower income families by fourfold. Well, this measure is meant to tackle inequality in
*20:11.860- 20:17.440* :  the country, but it is not without its critics. I spoke to the BBC America's editor Leonardo
*20:17.440- 20:24.660* :  Russia. It allocates 50% of university places to people who come either from poor backgrounds.
*20:24.820- 20:33.740* :  There's a limit of about minimum wage salary family income or from different racial backgrounds.
*20:33.740- 20:41.600* :  Indigenous black mixed race also disabled. So you have a division of places according to that.
*20:42.060- 20:47.040* :  So you might have people who are white or describe themselves as white and they will be favored
*20:48.240- 20:52.880* :  by the squalters as well because they come from a low income family. How will it work?
*20:52.880- 20:59.340* :  Because Brazil is an incredibly racially diverse nation. Who says who is black, who is
*20:59.340- 21:06.440* :  indigenous and who is white? Well, the current legislation which was implemented about a decade ago
*21:07.200- 21:12.240* :  said that to avoid any sort of prejudice, it will be self declaration. People would come and say,
*21:12.240- 21:19.780* :  I declare that I identify as black, but then there were many accusations or fraud, especially in
*21:19.780- 21:26.320* :  the most difficult courses like medicine. So different universities have set up committees to
*21:26.320- 21:32.040* :  verify that, to check if they agree or not. And it's still not in the law, but that's what most
*21:32.040- 21:36.340* :  universities do. If someone declared that they are black or they are indigenous, they will check.
*21:36.860- 21:41.580* :  So why has President Lula said that this program needs to be extended by fourfold?
*21:42.420- 21:48.480* :  Well, what you have in Brazil is a situation that where Brazil, many people won't know, has the
*21:48.480- 21:55.100* :  second biggest black population in the world after Nigeria. It was the last country in the world
*21:55.100- 22:01.720* :  to free slaves. So there's a lot of, let's say, historical legacy and a history of discrimination
*22:01.900- 22:07.940* :  where most of the people, I would say the most of the black people, people of African origin,
*22:07.940- 22:15.140* :  many of them are mixed, are the poorest. But the criticism to this legislation is that
*22:15.140- 22:21.180* :  autoculticism in Brazil is a racial diverse country. You have people in the same family who will
*22:21.180- 22:27.160* :  look black or who look white or mix race. So it's not the same scenario as you had in the United States
*22:27.160- 22:34.080* :  or let's say in South Africa. So that's one of the criticism. But what President Lula said is we
*22:34.080- 22:40.440* :  have been doing what we can to reduce social inequality and racism. And that's a way of doing it.
*22:40.920- 22:46.940* :  The current legislation has managed to get many, many people into university and people who did
*22:46.940- 22:53.140* :  well, who wouldn't have gone into university without it. That was Lenado, Russia. In Iceland,
*22:53.140- 22:58.880* :  they are bracing themselves for a volcanic eruption. The town of Greendavi has been evacuated
*22:59.340- 23:04.880* :  after cracks and holes started to appear in the ground. One resident recorded a tremor hitting his
*23:11.680- 23:15.680* :  house on Friday. Well, Evan Davis got the latest from Icelandic journalist and radio presenter
*23:15.680- 23:22.040* :  Hulda Gerstote. There's still a lot of uncertainty regarding an eruption. There is a slight
*23:22.040- 23:27.680* :  possibility that there won't be one. But they say that the odds are much higher on that there will
*23:27.680- 23:32.540* :  be an eruption, whether it'll happen in hours, in days or in weeks. We don't know at this point.
*23:33.160- 23:37.360* :  But what has happened today, in which is a new development, is that people have been allowed
*23:38.140- 23:45.100* :  to come into the town in small groups, one person per home to get their valuables. And they get
*23:45.100- 23:50.500* :  about five minutes to go into the house and get what they need. The town you're talking about,
*23:50.500- 23:58.260* :  Greendavi. It's not that far from the main airport. No, I mean, are people braced for having
*23:58.260- 24:04.660* :  to close the airport for some period? Not at this point. We've had three eruptions in this area
*24:04.720- 24:09.460* :  in the last three years, but they haven't been in the town. So they've been in the vicinity.
*24:10.220- 24:15.220* :  And in none of those cases, the airport has had to close or had any problems. The risk is that
*24:15.220- 24:19.780* :  if it goes out to sea, it could be a little bit different because if the lava mixes with
*24:19.780- 24:25.660* :  a seawater, then we could be looking at some ash and steam and things. But at this moment,
*24:25.700- 24:31.140* :  there's nothing to worry about there. And just to add, it is completely safe at the moment to
*24:31.140- 24:36.300* :  travel to Iceland. So if you have travel plans to come to Iceland, I'm sorry, you're not going to
*24:36.300- 24:41.200* :  be able to go to the blue lagoon. But everything else is fine. People can travel from the airport
*24:41.200- 24:46.820* :  to the city and then out around the country. So there's no need to worry about that at this moment.
*24:47.380- 24:52.000* :  What is happening to the people, the citizens of Greendavi, who have evacuated their town? Where
*24:52.000- 24:56.940* :  do they all go? Is there a kind of a protocol for what happens when you have to evacuate somewhere?
*24:57.280- 25:03.680* :  Well, we're a very small nation. And in times like this, people come together. So what happened
*25:03.680- 25:09.700* :  on Saturday when they had to evacuate in the middle of the night? Most of the people could go and stay
*25:09.700- 25:16.000* :  with friends and relatives. There is a population of immigrants in the town, people from Poland and
*25:16.000- 25:22.060* :  other countries that don't have this network of family and friends in the country. And some of these
*25:22.060- 25:26.820* :  people had to go to shelters. And then there's all these practical things they're trying to figure out
*25:26.820- 25:32.300* :  now where the kids go to school. You know, how do we keep things going? The businesses in Greendavi
*25:32.300- 25:37.840* :  are closed. Of course, there's a lot of valuables going to waste right now sitting in the fishing
*25:37.840- 25:45.000* :  factories and all the places. But it's actually been amazing to see a collective effort on social
*25:45.000- 25:50.360* :  media by people where people are just coming in to this group that was put together and they're
*25:50.360- 25:57.780* :  offering housing, clothes, any kind of assistance. But there's a lot of work ahead of us. Whether
*25:57.780- 26:03.280* :  there's an eruption or not, because there's a lot of damage in this little town already. Scientists
*26:03.280- 26:10.100* :  are saying that there's a new eruption era. But we do have experience from a whole town going under
*26:10.460- 26:16.980* :  in 1973 when there was an eruption in the Westman Islands, the town changed. But a lot of people came
*26:16.980- 26:25.020* :  back and pulled out and cleaned out tons and tons of ash and lava and built new houses and went
*26:25.020- 26:32.680* :  back there. But it's just, it's so surreal. It's so difficult to imagine the feelings and the
*26:32.680- 26:37.500* :  thoughts of the people who are in this situation at the moment. Huldergeistoteer in Iceland.
*26:38.960- 26:43.600* :  Thousands of people came out onto the streets of Manchester in England to honour one of English
*26:43.600- 26:48.880* :  football's greatest players, Sir Bobby Chalton. The former Manchester United player died last
*26:48.880- 26:55.740* :  month, aged 86. These fans told us why they'd come. I feel like it had to come today to
*26:55.800- 27:00.560* :  pay tribute really to someone who served Manchester United by the way he did. You know,
*27:00.560- 27:04.320* :  Champions League winner, World Cup winner. There's not many of them in the world. It's just
*27:04.680- 27:08.900* :  something you've got to do for the history of the club, the history of the man. He was just
*27:10.020- 27:16.020* :  pivotal for England and Germany United. My dad used to watch him. I heard a lot about him growing up
*27:16.240- 27:20.620* :  and he played a massive part in the rebuilding of this club. So what it is today?
*27:21.820- 27:27.560* :  Player, director, it's up guy. As our sports editor down Rowan reports, the funeral
*27:27.560- 27:33.120* :  court age began at United Ground Old Trafford and the route ended at Manchester Cathedral where a
*27:33.120- 27:40.660* :  private funeral was held. A final farewell for arguably English football's greatest ever figure.
*27:41.280- 27:46.540* :  Here at the stadium where he's immortalised thousands paying tribute to Sir Bobby Chalton earlier
*27:46.900- 27:53.180* :  as his funeral courtage, past Old Trafford, home of the club where he made more than 750 appearances.
*27:55.680- 27:59.920* :  Members of United's youth teams forming a guard of honour as the Hearst Drove passed,
*27:59.920- 28:03.320* :  the ground adorned with images depicting a glittering career.
*28:15.120- 28:20.020* :  Manchester Cathedral, meanwhile, a thousand guests, including the FA president, Prince William,
*28:20.480- 28:25.420* :  legendary former United Manager, Sir Alex Ferguson and a host of other footballing stars,
*28:25.420- 28:31.620* :  past and present arriving for a private memorial service. One of Sir Bobby's former teammates
*28:31.620- 28:39.000* :  paying this tribute. Never thought in my dreams as a kid that I'd come through and play for
*28:39.000- 28:43.000* :  Manchester United, but playing with Bobby Chalton. Somebody special, isn't it?
*28:44.940- 28:49.380* :  With many more gathering at the end of the funeral procession to show just how much he meant to them,
*28:49.380- 28:54.020* :  Charlton's coffin, accompanied by his family, was carried into the cathedral for a service
*28:54.020- 29:00.180* :  celebrating a remarkable life. A survivor of the 1958 Munich Air Disaster, over the next decade,
*29:00.180- 29:05.600* :  Charlton reached the very top of the game. World Cup winner with England in 1966,
*29:05.820- 29:11.920* :  European Cup winner with United two years later renowned not only for his goals scoring and skill,
*29:12.280- 29:14.000* :  but also his decency and class.
*29:25.240- 29:29.860* :  With today's service followed by a private wake at Old Trafford, the world of football was left
*29:29.860- 29:35.080* :  to reflect on the loss of a truly legendary figure, but one that will never be forgotten.
*29:35.680- 29:42.960* :  Dan Rowan. In 1995, an experimental filmmaker called Jerry Fialca from Venice, California
*29:43.480- 29:48.420* :  set up a book club. It's a once a month or so was to get together and discuss one of the hardest
*29:48.420- 29:54.880* :  works of modern literature. James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. Well last month, they finally got to the end.
*29:54.880- 30:01.960* :  Jerry told us why he chose this particular novel. Finnegan's Wake is beyond description. As Sam
*30:01.960- 30:08.940* :  Beckett said, it's not about something. It is something. The reason it took us 28 years to get
*30:08.940- 30:20.120* :  through 628 pages was because for 25 years, we read two pages once a month. It's so dense at times
*30:20.120- 30:27.500* :  that you want to take the time to suss it out. How it makes you feel. What Joyce may or may not
*30:27.580- 30:33.240* :  be probing or hoiking up. Finne Fordman is another enthusiast,
*30:33.500- 30:38.620* :  a James Joyce specialist at Royal Holloway University in London. He runs a monthly seminar
*30:38.620- 30:44.360* :  on Fiddingham's Wake as he's been telling Nula McGovern. I started a reading group in 1993.
*30:44.360- 30:52.640* :  We stopped in 1997 as I got on with my life, but we restarted again in 2007, so that's about
*30:52.640- 31:01.720* :  16 years, and we've done about 80 or 90 pages. We tend to do about 7 or 8 lines each session
*31:02.340- 31:08.080* :  with meeting roughly once a month. That's how slowly we're going. I think the Venice Beach group
*31:08.080- 31:13.760* :  do maybe a page, a session maybe a page a week or something, so they're really roaring through it.
*31:14.040- 31:18.060* :  I think there'll be a lot of my listeners that will have never cracked it open. What's in it? What
*31:18.060- 31:25.960* :  takes so long? Talk us through the fascination and also the frustration. It's kind of an encyclopedia,
*31:26.780- 31:33.540* :  and it's encyclopedia that includes all of language, all of history, all of human relationships,
*31:34.660- 31:40.400* :  and it manages to do that by focusing on just a family with an inkeeper, a pub keeper,
*31:41.020- 31:46.820* :  where there are lots of customers and people gossiping in the pub, and out of that very small
*31:47.520- 31:54.580* :  set of materials, he manages to open it out into the relationships between people all around the
*31:54.580- 32:01.320* :  world in political terms, between a tyrant and the people. You don't need to read the whole thing.
*32:01.740- 32:06.400* :  You can just open it up, crack the spine at any point, read a single page,
*32:07.160- 32:12.120* :  something will jump out at you, like a jewel in the mud. If you look at the very first page,
*32:12.120- 32:18.780* :  you may not make a head or tail of it, but you will see that there is a huge 100-letter word in
*32:18.780- 32:24.420* :  the middle of it, and it's actually not that difficult to have an idea of what's going on.
*32:24.680- 32:29.800* :  It's a 100-letter word which introduces a thunder clap, or somebody may be falling down the stairs.
*32:29.800- 32:41.100* :  That particular word, it goes, you can just see it. Yes, you can.
*32:41.980- 32:49.600* :  It bangs on every step. It was sounding to me like Welch and also like Irish, to my ear. James
*32:49.600- 32:54.100* :  Joyce, if I'm correct, it took him 17 years to write. Do you think he was expecting people to
*32:54.100- 33:01.060* :  read it, cover to cover? He was. He was really hoping for actually a bigger impact than it had,
*33:01.060- 33:07.000* :  and he was a bit disappointed. It came out in May 1939. People had their minds on other things at
*33:07.000- 33:11.480* :  that moment, and he really thought it would be much better world if people were reading his book
*33:11.480- 33:17.640* :  than thinking about Waging War. Who is joining you on this? What do we call it?
*33:17.740- 33:24.160* :  Journey seems too short, I think. Odyssey is good. Yes, that's a nice long journey. We have
*33:24.160- 33:30.980* :  academics and non-academics, and we have young people and older people. We have people from
*33:30.980- 33:36.100* :  around the world. One of the names of the heroes of this book is, here comes everybody.
*33:37.060- 33:42.780* :  And it is a kind of come-all ye. Everybody can get involved, and everybody will find something in
*33:42.780- 33:47.440* :  this book of interest. And I don't know how old you are, Finn, but I mean, do you think you'll
*33:47.700- 33:53.860* :  finish it in your lifetime? Well, I think the Californian group has said it. It's not a book that
*33:53.860- 34:00.280* :  you really ever finish. It doesn't really have a beginning or an end. It's made up of so many
*34:00.280- 34:06.400* :  different elements that there's always something more. I've been reading this for nearly 40 years,
*34:07.420- 34:10.940* :  and I don't feel I've finished it. Finn Fordman.
*34:13.700- 34:17.860* :  And that's all from us for now, but before we go, I'd like to tell you about a special podcast
*34:17.860- 34:22.080* :  we're planning. At the end of this month, world leaders are meeting at the UN Climate Change
