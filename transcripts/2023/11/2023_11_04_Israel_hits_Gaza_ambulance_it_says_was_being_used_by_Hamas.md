*00:30.500- 00:34.060* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:35.400- 00:40.240* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and in the early hours of Saturday 4th November, these are our main stories.
*00:40.300- 00:46.120* :  Israel has confirmed that one of its aircraft struck an ambulance in Gaza. It says it was being used
*00:46.120- 00:52.080* :  by Hamas fighters. The Palestinians say a medical convoy was hit twice, causing many casualties.
*00:52.780- 00:57.200* :  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledges there will be no pause in the fighting
*00:57.200- 01:02.000* :  until all hostages are released. The leader of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah
*01:02.140- 01:06.960* :  says the conflict could widen if Israel's attacks on Gaza don't cease.
*01:08.800- 01:14.100* :  Also in this podcast, the skulls of four 19th century indigenous warriors from Taiwan
*01:14.100- 01:20.080* :  are being returned by a Scottish university. Most of the skulls we hold will not be from individuals
*01:20.080- 01:24.120* :  who wanted their skulls to come to the university. They were collected without their consent.
*01:24.740- 01:30.640* :  And too hot to trot how a tarantula caused a traffic accident in Death Valley.
*01:34.920- 01:39.300* :  In Gaza, ambulances have come under fire with the Israelis saying it hit one,
*01:39.300- 01:45.080* :  killing Hamas fighters. It says we're using the vehicle to move weapons near an area of battle.
*01:45.360- 01:51.100* :  Hamas accuses the Israelis of targeting a convoy of ambulances, leaving the Al-Shifa hospital in
*01:51.100- 01:56.960* :  Gaza City and in the process killing a large number of people. As spokesperson for the Hamas
*01:56.960- 02:03.140* :  Run Health Ministry said that wounded Palestinians in the vehicles were being moved from Gaza City
*02:03.140- 02:08.780* :  towards the border with Egypt. Bizanada, a filmmaker and journalist, was at the hospital.
*02:09.380- 02:12.120* :  A warning you may find what you're about to hear, distressing.
*02:41.440- 02:46.960* :  On Friday, the US Secretary of State, Ashley Blinken, was in Israel pressing for a pause in
*02:46.960- 02:52.500* :  the fighting, some more aid reaches civilians. But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*02:52.500- 02:58.920* :  rejected any such pause and repeated his demand that Hamas released the hostages it abducted
*02:58.920- 03:03.880* :  last month, at least 240 of them, according to officials in Israel.
*03:14.080- 03:16.560* :  As the conflict in Gaza continues, the Hamas Run Health Ministry in the territory
*03:21.120- 03:23.980* :  said that more than 9,200 people had been killed since Hamas massacred 1,400 people in Israel.
*03:23.980- 03:29.180* :  I got the latest about Gaza from our diplomatic correspondent, Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem.
*03:29.180- 03:36.020* :  Since Hamas massacred 1,400 people in Israel. I got the latest about Gaza from our diplomatic
*03:36.020- 03:41.580* :  correspondent, Paul Adams, who's in Jerusalem. That was certainly very upsetting footage and
*03:41.720- 03:47.340* :  we've seen an awful lot of that in the last few days, Valerie. There were bodies lying on the ground
*03:47.340- 03:54.720* :  next to ambulances. Clearly some of the people we could see were dead. Others were very badly wounded.
*03:55.300- 04:01.020* :  Now, it wasn't at all clear what was going on there. There was some suggestion that there was
*04:01.020- 04:07.880* :  an attempt to mount some kind of convoy to take wounded people down south out of Ham's way
*04:07.880- 04:14.100* :  and that some kind of projectile, a missile possibly launched from a drone landed nearby,
*04:14.140- 04:20.880* :  perhaps in an attempt to stop this convoy. And as a result, we saw these injuries. Now,
*04:20.880- 04:25.300* :  the Israelis haven't talked about that incident, but they have put out a statement
*04:25.300- 04:31.680* :  tonight which appears to describe maybe a separate incident in which they say that a number
*04:31.680- 04:38.860* :  of Hamas operatives were killed and they say that it was an attempt to use an ambulance to
*04:38.860- 04:44.740* :  transport Hamas gunmen from one location to another and that that was why it was struck.
*04:45.280- 04:50.560* :  So whether these two relate to the same episode or two different episodes, I'm afraid to say
*04:50.560- 04:56.020* :  it's not at all clear. Now, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has been in Israel and
*04:56.020- 05:04.260* :  indeed in Jordan. Do you think his trip increases the chances of a humanitarian pause in exchange
*05:04.260- 05:08.640* :  for more aid and indeed the release of the hostages? Well, I think that's certainly what he would like
*05:08.640- 05:15.460* :  to achieve and you can sense a slight upping of the pressure from the United States on Israel
*05:16.060- 05:22.080* :  to achieve something like that. This is not a ceasefire. This is what they are calling a
*05:22.080- 05:28.820* :  humanitarian pause, basically brief breaks in the fighting so that aid can get into where it's
*05:28.820- 05:36.240* :  needed and possibly also to buy time and space for hostage negotiations. Now, at the moment,
*05:36.240- 05:41.760* :  Anthony Blinken says that there are discussions going on, there are mechanisms being discussed.
*05:41.760- 05:47.240* :  We have not heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu any obvious
*05:47.240- 05:53.180* :  sign of a willingness to go down this route and in fact, there on one specific issue today,
*05:53.180- 05:58.980* :  there was a clear disagreement and that is on the question of fuel because the US has said and
*05:58.980- 06:03.980* :  Mr Blinken was saying this that they're trying to identify mechanisms to get fuel into the southern
*06:03.980- 06:10.460* :  part of the Gaza Strip where it's badly needed for hospitals and for the aid agencies to move
*06:10.460- 06:16.700* :  aid around the southern Gaza Strip. But the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that he
*06:16.700- 06:22.340* :  is adamantly opposed to all fuel going into Gaza. The Israeli view is that all of that ends up
*06:22.340- 06:28.200* :  in the hands of Hamas. Paul Adams in Jerusalem. Well, until Friday, we hadn't heard from the leader
*06:28.200- 06:33.800* :  of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah about the Lebanese Islamist group's reaction to the conflict in Gaza.
*06:34.360- 06:39.540* :  But now he's given a televised speech saying the only way to prevent a regional war is for Israel
*06:39.540- 06:46.780* :  to stop attacking Gaza and all options on the Lebanese front he says are open. Here is Hassan Nasrallah
*06:46.780- 06:55.860* :  on the attack by Hamas on Israel on October the 7th. This is the first operation which has been a
*06:55.860- 07:10.860* :  historic point and a blessed point. This was Appalachian decision-100 person and supported by
*07:10.860- 07:17.520* :  the Palestinians, 100 percent. The head of the speech the army in Israel had been on what they
*07:17.520- 07:24.200* :  termed a very, very high alert. I got the latest from Hugo Bacheca on Lebanon's border with Israel.
*07:25.040- 07:31.480* :  All eyes were on the speech by Hassan Nasrallah. The first time he gave a public speech since the
*07:31.480- 07:37.280* :  beginning of this war between Israel and Gaza. And again, he said all options are on the table that
*07:37.280- 07:42.380* :  the only way to prevent the war from spreading across the region is to stop the conflict in Gaza.
*07:42.380- 07:48.840* :  He said Hezbollah's actions would be determined by what happens in Gaza and also by Israel's actions
*07:48.840- 07:54.540* :  towards Hezbollah and Lebanon. So very important points, but I think what is also important is that
*07:54.540- 08:00.900* :  he did not give any indication that the group is preparing a massive escalation of the violence
*08:00.900- 08:05.520* :  that is happening along the border. So I think that's very important. I think people here in
*08:05.520- 08:12.680* :  Lebanon tonight are relieved. I think lots of people were very concerned that he could perhaps
*08:12.680- 08:19.260* :  announce a massive escalation in this offensive by Hezbollah against Israeli targets.
*08:19.260- 08:23.660* :  And obviously the fear here is that this could drag Lebanon into this conflict.
*08:24.220- 08:28.720* :  And what's happening on the border now? So we've seen that for weeks Hezbollah has been
*08:28.720- 08:35.200* :  carrying out these cross-border attacks targeting Israeli positions. Israel has been retaliating.
*08:35.200- 08:41.340* :  And I think the underlying fear is that this could escalate and this could become another front
*08:41.340- 08:45.740* :  in this conflict. We've heard from Israeli officials, from American officials have been warning
*08:45.740- 08:52.120* :  Hezbollah against escalating the situation, promising a devastating response if they decided to do so.
*08:52.760- 08:58.420* :  Hugo Bacheca, hundreds of foreign passport holders have now been able to leave Gaza
*08:58.420- 09:04.700* :  through the RAFA crossing into Egypt, including British Palestinian doctor Abdul Qadir Hamad.
*09:05.200- 09:10.020* :  He was cleared for passage through the border, but was turned away on Wednesday. On Thursday,
*09:10.020- 09:15.600* :  he tried again this time successfully and traveled to the airport in Cairo for a flight to London.
*09:16.280- 09:18.660* :  Anita Anand asked him about his experience.
*09:19.780- 09:28.300* :  We were out by 1130 to the Egyptian side, but then we were pulled up in no man's land
*09:29.100- 09:36.640* :  for four and a half hours waiting for the Egyptians to allow us into their arrivals hall.
*09:37.780- 09:44.140* :  My understanding there was a standoff between the Egyptians and the Israeli's regarding
*09:44.220- 09:53.980* :  entry of ambulances from Gaza to Egypt and they have stopped us as part of the negotiations
*09:53.980- 09:59.080* :  between the parties. What was it like and did you have water food and what was it like in no man's
*09:59.080- 10:08.340* :  land? Okay, there isn't really any water or I mean you can buy water but there isn't food,
*10:08.340- 10:17.840* :  very crowded area, there are lots of people there and chaotic there is no system to see who is
*10:17.840- 10:25.000* :  going, who's not going and a lot of people are trying obviously to leave Gaza but there are names
*10:25.000- 10:33.000* :  which has been listed to be evacuated but and these are only the international gestures there
*10:33.000- 10:43.140* :  when we left. So at the Egyptian side, we entered about 430, we were processed inside their terminal,
*10:43.140- 10:52.180* :  it's also a lot of people are chaotic and then we were finished by seven o'clock and we boarded
*10:52.180- 11:00.080* :  the bus to Cairo and arrived this morning at four o'clock. And what was the reception like in Cairo?
*11:01.600- 11:07.740* :  In fact, I mean I have to say here that I was pleased to see the officials from the British
*11:07.740- 11:14.940* :  government at the crossing in Rafa and they arranged our transport to Cairo and the hotel in Cairo.
*11:15.380- 11:21.440* :  Now that you are in Cairo, I wonder if it's actually hit home with you that you are out
*11:22.080- 11:29.300* :  and you are safe. Oh, I'm hugely relieved that I am out. They are my colleagues, my patients
*11:29.300- 11:34.960* :  who are in a terrible situation and a lot of them I think will die because of there is no
*11:34.960- 11:41.460* :  medications, nor the illnesses and that begs my heart. And now that you are out of that place,
*11:41.480- 11:47.680* :  I mean would you have a message to those who have authority in this country, what would you tell
*11:47.680- 11:56.680* :  them? I mean, I'm not a politician, I'm a doctor and my duty is to save lives and I think there
*11:56.780- 12:05.060* :  are unnecessary waste of human life in this conflict. Mostly there are civilians, the children,
*12:06.380- 12:12.760* :  those who are not involved in the conflict directly and they need to look into that this is a
*12:13.540- 12:18.980* :  humanitarian disaster at a scale which I don't think has been seen before.
*12:20.320- 12:24.420* :  Dr Abdul Qadir Hamad speaking there to Anita Anand.
*12:26.260- 12:31.300* :  Other news now, it's the first trip to a commonwealth country since the start of their reign.
*12:31.300- 12:36.200* :  And now the British royals King Charles and Queen Camilla have completed their four-day
*12:36.200- 12:42.160* :  state visit to Kenya in the coastal city of Mambasa. The king met into faith leaders at the
*12:42.160- 12:47.960* :  memorial cathedral there while the queen was given a warm welcome when she met survivors of domestic
*12:56.260- 13:00.220* :  violence. Earlier King Charles was shown how the authorities are trying to conserve marine
*13:00.220- 13:05.400* :  habitats and the coral reef. As our senior Africa correspondent Anne Saw explains,
*13:05.400- 13:11.160* :  the environment has been a key feature of this tour. Every step of the way there was an
*13:11.160- 13:16.500* :  element of environmental conservation. As soon as he arrived in Nairobi during their official
*13:16.500- 13:22.500* :  welcome on Tuesday morning, he planted a tree at State House and he went on to plant several
*13:22.500- 13:29.040* :  other trees during his visit. And in the coastal city of Mambasa, he met conservationists from a
*13:29.040- 13:35.240* :  community marine conservationists and I have just seen a picture of him and the queen posing inside
*13:35.240- 13:42.480* :  an electric took-took which he was meant to ride into historic fort Jesus but the weather hasn't
*13:42.520- 13:49.280* :  been very friendly today. But this visit was about celebrating the areas of cooperation between
*13:49.280- 13:55.100* :  Britain and Kenya. It's also about a reflection of the past and there are elements of the past that
*13:55.100- 14:00.040* :  are not very comfortable, which the king, for the first time, a reigning monarch brought them up,
*14:00.420- 14:05.460* :  expressing deep sorrow and regret for their atrocities committed by the colonial government
*14:05.540- 14:13.080* :  during the emergency period in the 1950s. He also met some of the surviving family members of
*14:13.240- 14:18.980* :  heroes who were recognized in Kenya as having led their different communities from the coast to
*14:18.980- 14:25.460* :  central Kenya and the Rift Valley to oppose colonial settlement. So it was something different,
*14:25.460- 14:32.140* :  something that has been welcomed here. However, there have been criticisms that the king should
*14:32.140- 14:38.040* :  have gone further to actually offer an apology for that but that we understand is something that
*14:38.040- 14:45.140* :  government ministers would need to make a decision on. And so, and staying in Kenya, the Ogiak
*14:45.140- 14:50.800* :  people are one of the last indigenous forest communities to survive in the country. But now the
*14:50.800- 14:56.040* :  Rights Group Survival International says the authorities there are brutally evicting them from
*14:56.040- 15:02.460* :  their ancestral land. Survival says forest rangers and the police are forcibly pushing out
*15:02.460- 15:08.200* :  up to 700 Ogiak from their homes in the Maaforist, all in the name of conservation.
*15:08.920- 15:12.420* :  Our Africa Regional Editor Richard Hamilton has been following the story.
*15:13.700- 15:18.040* :  Well, let's stay in Kenya because one of the country's minority communities, the Ogiak is
*15:18.040- 15:22.580* :  marking a year since the African Court of Justice ruled in their fever.
*15:22.660- 15:27.360* :  The Ogiak people have had a long history of run-ins with the government in Nairobi.
*15:27.500- 15:34.180* :  In 2017, a court found that the Kenyan administration had violated the rights of the Ogiak
*15:34.180- 15:39.300* :  who have lived in the forest for centuries as hunter-gatherers and famous beekeepers.
*15:40.060- 15:44.560* :  But over the years, the Maaforist in the Rift Valley has seen human encroachment
*15:44.560- 15:50.620* :  and environmental degradation, threatening the future of Kenya's main water catchment area.
*15:51.480- 15:57.240* :  From the 1920s, the British colonial administration evicted many Ogiak communities
*15:57.240- 16:03.700* :  to create game parks and forest reserves. Survival International says these current evictions
*16:03.740- 16:09.280* :  go against several court rulings. Fiorre Longo is their campaign manager.
*16:09.820- 16:16.440* :  Rangers from the Kenyan forestry service and the Kenyan wildlife service are evicting up to 700
*16:17.000- 16:21.500* :  Ogiak people. Their hunter-gatherers depend on the forest for living and they are being evicted
*16:21.500- 16:27.060* :  from their forest in the name of conservation. Their houses are being destroyed with hammers and
*16:27.060- 16:32.340* :  access or sometimes they're burning. The Rangers are burning the houses. So people are being
*16:32.340- 16:37.100* :  just sent away. We are talking about pregnant women, about children, about elders that they
*16:37.100- 16:42.720* :  don't have any other place to go and it's raining and it's cold and they're suffering a lot.
*16:43.080- 16:49.240* :  Some Ogiak people say these evictions are related to carbon credits that the government in Nairobi
*16:49.240- 16:56.300* :  promoted at the recent Africa Climate Summit. It comes as King Charles finishes a royal visit to Kenya,
*16:56.880- 17:02.040* :  potentially embarrassing both for the Kenyan president William Ruto and the British monarch.
*17:03.220- 17:09.240* :  Richard Hamilton. The remains of four tribal warriors killed nearly 150 years ago
*17:09.640- 17:15.680* :  are being repatriated from Scotland to their indigenous community in Taiwan. The Taiwanese
*17:15.680- 17:21.560* :  fighters were killed during a Japanese attack on the south of the island in 1874 with their heads
*17:21.560- 17:28.120* :  taken as trophies and the skulls came into the possession of Edinburgh University in 1907.
*17:28.140- 17:33.440* :  Our Scotland correspondent Laura Gordon reports. In an Edinburgh building devoted to academia,
*17:33.440- 17:38.400* :  a traditional ceremony led by a shaman from the Mudan community in the south of Taiwan.
*17:46.340- 17:51.000* :  The shaman is summoning the ancestral spirits of four tribal warriors killed by the Japanese
*17:51.000- 17:56.220* :  almost 150 years ago. Their skulls, which were taken as trophies of war,
*17:56.500- 18:00.320* :  eventually ended up in the anatomical collection at the University of Edinburgh.
*18:00.320- 18:05.320* :  The collection, which contains more than 1700 skulls, is considered globally significant
*18:05.320- 18:10.280* :  and is used for research into the history of genetics, diet and the movement of people.
*18:11.180- 18:16.160* :  Tom Gillingwater, who's the university's professor of anatomy, says the institution has a long
*18:16.160- 18:20.560* :  held policy to return remains when asked and where provenance can be identified.
*18:21.360- 18:25.620* :  Most of the skulls we hold will not be from individuals who want to their skulls to come to the
*18:25.620- 18:30.420* :  university. They were collected without their consent. A large part of that does come from the
*18:30.420- 18:36.480* :  colonial reaches and this is really part of our efforts to understand that history and we're
*18:36.480- 18:42.260* :  appropriate to then try and make amends and then return ancestral remains to their individual
*18:42.260- 18:47.440* :  peoples in this case to the Mudan tribe in Taiwan. This is the first time Taiwan has made a
*18:47.440- 18:52.680* :  request for remains to be returned. They will now go to their homeland where a permanent resting
*18:52.680- 18:59.980* :  place will now be found. Lorna Gordon. Still to come in this podcast, the hidden
*18:59.980- 19:07.040* :  costs of cancer treatment for children in Uganda. My mom and daddy were famous. They didn't have
*19:07.040- 19:13.660* :  enough money for buying food and for transport to go back home. I almost stopped my cancer treatment
*19:13.660- 19:21.400* :  last year. It was so bad. But before we move on, let's get news of today's happy part with Andrew
*19:21.660- 19:26.200* :  Peach. Yes, there's a musical theme this week with the Ukrainian refugee who wrote a piece of

*20:45.980- 20:51.740* :  Italy has had almost 70 governments since World War II, more than twice the number in Britain and
*20:51.740- 20:57.180* :  Germany. Repeated attempts to produce a more robust system have failed, but now the current
*20:57.180- 21:03.100* :  Prime Minister, George Ameloni, has backed a proposal on constitutional reform. In a news conference,
*21:03.100- 21:10.080* :  she explained her reasons. It's guaranteed that those who are elected by the people can govern with
*21:10.080- 21:14.820* :  a clear timeframe for the legislature, which makes sure that there is stability for the government,
*21:14.820- 21:19.760* :  which will have five years to put its projects into practice. This will guarantee a stability,
*21:19.760- 21:25.160* :  which is essential for the credibility of the government, both on a national and international level.
*21:27.320- 21:30.620* :  Our correspondent, Danny Eberhard, told me more about the proposals.
*21:31.180- 21:35.440* :  Well, the main thing, Valleys, that there would be a direct election for the Prime Minister,
*21:35.440- 21:41.260* :  and the person would get five years in power, which in Italian terms is a lifetime really.
*21:41.260- 21:46.220* :  Since the Second World War, governments have lasted on average a little over a year and a month.
*21:46.220- 21:50.600* :  As she mentioned in that clip, getting a legislative programme together that actually has
*21:50.600- 21:54.460* :  some sort of long-term planning is very difficult in Italy, and that's why, for example,
*21:54.460- 21:59.020* :  she talks about credibility on an international stage, because some countries say, well,
*21:59.020- 22:03.320* :  your Prime Minister of Italy at the moment, but who's going to be Prime Minister a year down the line?
*22:03.320- 22:08.380* :  So another important thing is the party or the coalition that backs the candidate for the Prime
*22:08.380- 22:13.780* :  Minister that actually wins the election would get a majority of seats nationwide in Parliament.
*22:13.780- 22:19.320* :  That level hasn't been fixed yet, but they're suggesting at minimum level a 55% of the seats.
*22:19.940- 22:24.220* :  So that would be a transformative event for the Italian political system.
*22:24.440- 22:29.100* :  And there's other aspects to it, so you couldn't make a technocratic government.
*22:29.180- 22:35.680* :  So the sort of government we saw with Mario Draghi in power before Miss Malone took over between
*22:35.680- 22:41.960* :  2021 and 2022, which have been used sometimes to carry on a legislative programme, for example,
*22:41.960- 22:47.240* :  things like spending coronavirus funds when there isn't actually a clear majority in Italian
*22:47.240- 22:51.560* :  Parliament. Often some of the more successful governments have indeed been technocratic governments.
*22:51.600- 22:58.020* :  The end-to-backroom deals, it's an end to what the Italian's called Rebaldoni, which are the
*22:58.020- 23:03.800* :  situations where in an unstable coalition, one party would change allegiance and undermine
*23:03.800- 23:08.680* :  the whole government, and also it would change the powers of the presidency. They say presidency
*23:08.680- 23:15.280* :  and his or her role would stay the same, but actually the president's power is clearest when there
*23:15.280- 23:21.180* :  is not a majority, and when the president appoints Prime Ministers and, for example, blocks
*23:21.180- 23:26.760* :  cabinet appointments, things like that. But any change in the constitution needs to secure a
*23:26.800- 23:31.820* :  two-thirds majority, doesn't it, in both houses of Parliament? So is this going to happen?
*23:31.820- 23:36.880* :  Currently, the governing coalition, it's a right-wing coalition of Miss Malone, does command
*23:36.880- 23:42.940* :  majorities in both houses, but doesn't command the two-thirds majority. For a constitutional change
*23:42.940- 23:49.380* :  to take place, if the legislation goes through houses with a majority, it can then go to a public
*23:49.380- 23:54.820* :  referendum, and that's really where this thing is going to be tested. Clearly, in the political
*23:54.820- 23:59.220* :  opposition oppose it, they fear that this might be some sort of paragraph from Miss Malone.
*23:59.220- 24:05.300* :  There's also a period before it even gets voted on, where it may change in committee stage.
*24:05.880- 24:11.060* :  So this proposal is very much a first step, and we'll see where we're at a few months down the line.
*24:11.740- 24:17.720* :  Danny Eberhardt, a leading expert on artificial intelligence has said it could be some time
*24:17.720- 24:23.180* :  before advances in the technology remove the need for people to work, despite an ambitious
*24:23.180- 24:28.760* :  prediction from the tech billionaire Elon Musk. Following this week's AI Safety Summit and
*24:28.760- 24:33.720* :  during an interview with Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister, Mr Musk said artificial
*24:33.740- 24:40.780* :  intelligence would one day take over all jobs. But Professor Dame Wendy Hall, who was the UK's
*24:40.780- 24:46.900* :  first artificial intelligence skills champion, has heard out. More from our technology editor, Zoe
*24:46.900- 24:51.880* :  Climent. Elon Musk himself admitted that he wasn't sure whether people would be happy or sad
*24:51.880- 24:56.500* :  about the demise of employment as we know it. He was in conversation with the Prime Minister Rishi
*24:56.500- 25:01.380* :  Sunak at an event held in central London in front of a selected audience. Some journalists were
*25:01.380- 25:06.060* :  invited, but not allowed to ask questions. The computer scientist Professor Dame Wendy Hall
*25:06.060- 25:09.620* :  said his prediction would leave humans in a strange situation.
*25:09.920- 25:14.400* :  What does it mean to have a world without work? How will people be supported? Are we just going
*25:14.400- 25:19.300* :  to become the buyer fuel for the matrix? These are all very hypothetical, and you know, this whole
*25:19.300- 25:24.060* :  debate about, are we going to have an existential threat from AI? I borrowed these lines from
*25:24.060- 25:29.040* :  Suragion Smith, the President of the Ross Society who just says, not in my lifetime. Elon Musk's
*25:29.040- 25:34.240* :  forecast also contradicted the Prime Minister's messages about the impact of AI on jobs. He's been
*25:34.240- 25:39.160* :  careful to build the tech as a useful tool rather than a replacement and talks about new jobs
*25:39.160- 25:44.460* :  springing up around it, much like the rise of the internet created new, previously unheard of,
*25:45.740- 25:51.860* :  Zoe Kleinman. When a chart has cancer, it takes its toll on their families. But when potentially
*25:51.860- 25:58.200* :  life-saving treatment is available, but unaffordable, it can leave parents with heartbreaking decisions
*25:58.200- 26:04.360* :  to make. It's estimated that a third of children suffering from cancer in East Africa have had to
*26:04.360- 26:10.680* :  abandon treatment because of the cost. Often it's the hidden expenses of, say, traveling to hospitals
*26:10.680- 26:17.460* :  and accommodation that add up to insurmountable expense. Our reporter Anna Kumu has been to one
*26:17.460- 26:23.400* :  charity run hostel in the Ugandan capital Campala, which is trying to help children with cancer
*26:23.980- 26:33.800* :  and their families. It's a sunny day in Campala. Children play board games in the yard over hosting.
*26:36.220- 26:41.400* :  But this is a hostel like no other. Children staying here have one important thing in common.
*26:42.440- 26:47.000* :  They all have cancer. Futinia old Dorcas Chirope is one of them.
*26:47.980- 26:53.460* :  I was feeling pain. I cannot even play. I cannot even wash my own clothes.
*26:54.220- 26:59.140* :  Dorcas had to travel to Campala weekly to receive treatment, but her parents could not
*26:59.140- 27:05.680* :  pay for accommodation near the hospital, which meant a growing seven hour journey from the home and back.
*27:06.940- 27:14.000* :  My mom and daddy were famous. They didn't have enough money for buying food and for transport to
*27:14.000- 27:19.640* :  go back home. I almost stopped my cancer treatment last year. It was so bad.
*27:20.680- 27:24.760* :  In 2020, more than 3,000 children in Uganda were diagnosed with cancer,
*27:25.040- 27:30.140* :  since the World Health Organization. Treatment is available, but those from poorer communities
*27:30.140- 27:35.260* :  face huge challenges to access it. Dr. Joyce Balagade is the head of Pijati
*27:35.260- 27:38.400* :  concoology at Uganda Cancer Institute in Campala.
*27:39.460- 27:45.200* :  80-85% of the population of children with cancer here at the Cancer Institute are peasants
*27:46.240- 27:54.100* :  who live on less than $3, you know, a month. So for example here, a diagnosis can be made for free.
*27:54.280- 27:58.660* :  Chemotherapy is available at no cost to the patient's surgery.
*27:59.000- 28:02.840* :  Radio therapy attracts a small cost, but that can be wavered.
*28:03.760- 28:11.340* :  Despite which we have high treatment abandonment rates and a lot of that has to do with what we
*28:11.340- 28:17.560* :  call the hidden costs that nobody ever thinks about. A number of clinics in Campala are willing
*28:17.560- 28:23.480* :  to cover the costs to treat childhood cancer, but low income families who live far from the capital
*28:23.800- 28:28.340* :  still have to pay for transport, accommodation and food while the treatment takes place.
*28:29.080- 28:31.640* :  For many of them, the expense is too high.
*28:32.460- 28:39.200* :  We had a very serious situation with almost 50% treatment abandonment rate because of this,
*28:39.680- 28:46.040* :  and we ended up having a lot of floor cases, children who are around, you discharge them to come
*28:46.040- 28:52.040* :  back through weeks later, but they have nowhere to go, so they and their families camp on the floor.
*28:54.140- 28:57.800* :  Dorkas was lucky to find help. While completing her treatment,
*28:57.800- 29:03.300* :  she stayed at a hostel run by Blessed Child Foundation. The charity offers free shelter
*29:03.300- 29:06.760* :  for disadvantaged patients. Peter Genza is the director.
*29:07.680- 29:13.420* :  The home provides accommodation venues, transports to and from hospital and psychosocial support.
*29:13.420- 29:16.720* :  Most of the families that we are committed come from all over the country.
*29:17.000- 29:21.660* :  They are poor people from rural communities and they cannot afford even the basics like
*29:21.660- 29:23.180* :  the transport fair to bring them to town.
*29:27.840- 29:32.620* :  For the past decade, more than 6000 children in Uganda have received help from the blessed
*29:32.620- 29:38.540* :  child charity. Dorkas was one of them. The teenager has now completed her cancer treatment,
*29:39.160- 29:44.440* :  and even though she temporarily lost her hair because of chemotherapy, her spirits are high.
*29:45.200- 29:50.980* :  Now I have finished the treatment. I feel like go back home, go to school, see my family.
*29:52.100- 29:59.260* :  And that report from Anokobo. And let's return again to our main story, the conflict in Gaza.
*29:59.880- 30:04.360* :  Let's hear a signal that residents of Gaza will have been able to hear from Friday.
*30:21.680- 30:27.420* :  And that is the sound of the BBC Arabic service which has begun daily radio broadcasts
*30:27.660- 30:33.560* :  on medium wave that will provide the latest news to residents of Gaza, including practical information
*30:33.560- 30:39.660* :  about where to access vital services. The analog signal will still work even when internet
*30:39.660- 30:44.520* :  and phone connections are down. The controller of languages at the BBC World Service,
*30:44.520- 30:49.040* :  Tarik Kafala, said the radio service would broadcast vital information.
*30:49.880- 30:55.440* :  We'll be broadcasting on medium wave from Cyprus. Obviously the program is a lifeline program,
*30:55.440- 31:00.160* :  so it will include news updates and so on, but the main purpose will be to give information
*31:00.160- 31:05.340* :  to the population of Gaza that will help them make good decisions about how to stay safe,
*31:05.720- 31:12.340* :  how to access water, healthcare and food that they need in this obviously desperate situation.
*31:13.260- 31:18.120* :  Tarik Kafala. And finally, many of us have a fear of spiders,
*31:18.580- 31:24.580* :  few, though, have had such a devastating reaction to seeing one. The incident took place in the
*31:24.580- 31:30.080* :  aptly named Death Valley National Park in the United States when a pair of Swiss tourists
*31:30.080- 31:36.000* :  caught sight of a tarantula, legging it across Route 190. Terry Egan reports.
*31:36.960- 31:43.500* :  It's one of the hottest places on earth, but around now is when tarantulas are out in the desert
*31:43.500- 31:50.100* :  scouting for a mate. They take eight years or so to mature, one for each leg perhaps,
*31:50.140- 31:58.960* :  but then bang, they're off and nothing was about to stop this one, least of all a rented camper van.
*31:59.780- 32:06.060* :  All of which meant the van pulled up sharpish and a motorcycle crashed into the back of it,
*32:06.440- 32:13.460* :  while its rider was transported to hospital. Tarantulas have poor sight, they move slowly
*32:13.460- 32:20.300* :  and are not aggressive. They also tend to die within months of mating. They are obviously
*32:20.300- 32:27.240* :  no match for a van nor a motorcycle. Still, there's no accounting for terror,
*32:27.940- 32:31.540* :  especially in the remote area of Death Valley.
*32:32.580- 32:38.860* :  Terry Egan and I'm reliably informed that the tarantula walked away unscathed.
*32:41.100- 32:44.940* :  And that's it from us for now, but there'll be a new edition of the Global News podcast later.
*32:45.440- 32:49.940* :  If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, send us an email,
*32:49.940- 32:55.520* :  the address is globalpodcast at bbc.co.uk. You can also find us on X,
*32:55.520- 33:01.460* :  formerly known as Twitter at Global NewsPod. This edition was mixed by Javid Galani,
*33:01.460- 33:06.600* :  the producer was Alice Adely, the editor is Karen Martian. I'm Valerie Sanderson,
*33:06.600- 33:07.840* :  until next time, bye bye.
