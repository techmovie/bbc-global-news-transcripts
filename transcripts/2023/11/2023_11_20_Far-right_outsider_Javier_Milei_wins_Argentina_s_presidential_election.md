*00:31.700- 00:35.080* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:37.940- 00:44.020* :  I'm Rachel Wright and at 14 hours GMT on Monday the 20th of November, these are our main stories.
*00:44.060- 00:49.420* :  A new far-right president in South America, political outsider Javier Millet,
*00:49.420- 00:55.560* :  outlines his vision for the country. All those looking on from outside Argentina,
*00:55.560- 01:01.260* :  I want to say to you all that Argentina will return to its place in the world, that it should never
*01:01.260- 01:08.380* :  have lost. As 28 babies evacuated from a hospital and Gaza arrive in Egypt, another hospital in
*01:08.380- 01:17.200* :  the territory has become directly involved in the conflict. Also in this podcast, the Colombian
*01:17.200- 01:22.600* :  pop star Shakira has settled a multi-million dollar tax fraud case with Spain's authority,
*01:22.600- 01:28.700* :  on the day Hatra was to begin in Barcelona. And as the latest film is launched about their
*01:37.380- 01:41.400* :  historic figure Napoleon, what do the French make of the movie starring an American actor directed
*01:41.400- 01:53.040* :  by a Brit? We start in Argentina where supporters of the self-styled radical outsider Javier Millet
*01:53.320- 01:58.720* :  have been celebrating his victory in the presidential election. Mr Millet pulled off a massive
*01:58.720- 02:05.540* :  upset, easily beating his rival Sergio Massa of the ruling left-wing peronist party. Javier
*02:05.540- 02:11.440* :  Millet has promised a new dawn for a country ravaged by debt and inflation, pledging to do away with
*02:11.440- 02:17.880* :  the central bank and replace the peso with the US dollar. The former US president Donald Trump has
*02:17.880- 02:23.760* :  congratulated him on his victory, saying he will truly make Argentina great again. And Brazil's
*02:23.760- 02:30.100* :  former president Bolsonaro says hope shines again in South America. Our South America correspondent
*02:30.100- 02:37.960* :  Katie Watson reports. For Argentina, this was a political earthquake. Javier Millet won by a
*02:37.960- 02:43.420* :  wider than expected margin, and his victory sent a clear message. Argentinians want to change.
*02:47.480- 02:53.720* :  The situation in Argentina is critical. The changes our country needs are drastic. There is no room
*02:53.720- 02:59.280* :  for gradualism. There is no room for half-measures. Mr. Millet was a relative unknown until a few months
*02:59.280- 03:04.920* :  ago, but his brash manner, including wielding a chainsaw at a campaign event, got him noticed.
*03:04.920- 03:11.680* :  In a country where annual inflation is now over 140%, and two in five Argentinians now live in
*03:11.680- 03:20.260* :  poverty, a drastic new approach to fixing problems was a clever move. I think this time Argentina needed
*03:20.260- 03:25.260* :  a change, and that's why I bet on this new proposal. We are doing really bad as a country,
*03:25.360- 03:30.100* :  and I hope Millet does not disappoint us. With this current government, we have gone from bad
*03:30.620- 03:35.800* :  to worse. But the campaign was divisive, as his rival said Yamasa acknowledged when he
*03:35.800- 03:43.440* :  conceded defeat. I called him convinced that the most important thing for us Argentinians tonight
*03:43.440- 03:49.780* :  is to remember that working together dialogue and respect for peace rather than this violence is
*03:49.780- 03:58.740* :  the best path we should take. Beyond the economy, Mr. Millet also wants to loosen gun laws and
*03:58.740- 04:03.720* :  ban abortion, as people voted on Sunday the disillusionment with politics was clear.
*04:22.220- 04:27.220* :  He and his vice president have also repeatedly been accused of lacking respect for democracy,
*04:27.720- 04:31.800* :  and calling into question the official number of victims during the country's dictatorship.
*04:35.420- 04:40.920* :  All told, Millet's victory has been a shock for Argentina's traditional political scene,
*04:41.380- 04:45.540* :  one that for decades has been dominated by the political movement of parenthism.
*04:48.740- 04:53.340* :  Having Millet said he'll deliver change for Argentina, but few understand what that will
*04:53.340- 04:57.820* :  look like. On things clear, it will be unlike anything that's come before.
*05:02.440- 05:08.000* :  Katie Watson reporting. As we've been hearing, Javier Millet campaigned on bold promises,
*05:08.680- 05:12.780* :  but will he be able to deliver? Louis Fajardo is from BBC Monitoring.
*05:13.420- 05:18.260* :  That is precisely what many people are warning that it will happen in the next month,
*05:18.260- 05:23.540* :  as Millet tries to translate all these political promises into concrete policy actions.
*05:24.100- 05:29.720* :  Millet has a minority in Congress. He does not have a majority in Congress, and he will surely
*05:29.720- 05:34.820* :  face strong opposition. Also, Argentina has a very federal country with regional governors
*05:34.820- 05:39.400* :  having a lot of power, and his movement doesn't have even one governor on his side.
*05:39.640- 05:46.300* :  So it's going to be extremely difficult to face this situation also with harsh pressure from
*05:46.300- 05:51.720* :  market forces, which will be very, very skeptical in many cases of the promises he has made.
*05:52.020- 05:56.300* :  So he has a very, very strong, a very difficult road to continue now.
*05:57.040- 06:03.000* :  Louis Fajardo from BBC Monitoring. Another hospital in northern Gaza has become a centre of
*06:03.000- 06:08.900* :  fighting with 12 people reported killed by an Israeli strike. Israeli tanks have closed in on
*06:08.900- 06:14.660* :  the Indonesian hospital in Gaza City, and as we record this podcast, there are reports of
*06:14.660- 06:19.660* :  firing around the building. There's been no comment from the Israeli military on any specific
*06:19.660- 06:26.000* :  operation, but the IDF said it's continuing to target terrorists and terrorist infrastructure.
*06:26.000- 06:33.040* :  In Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, 28 premature Palestinian babies have now been evacuated,
*06:33.340- 06:38.420* :  and have been taken to Egypt, as we heard from our correspondent in Jerusalem, Yolanda Nell.
*06:39.520- 06:44.980* :  A glimmer of hope, the plight of these premature babies, has symbolised the suffering in the
*06:44.980- 06:51.100* :  devastating war between Israel and Hamas. They are the smallest survivors of the standoff at
*06:51.100- 06:57.040* :  a Shifa hospital. Now they're to be taken to Egypt. Doctors in southern Gaza have been working
*06:57.040- 07:05.080* :  to stabilise them. Several others have died. Even the water used for their formula was contaminated
*07:05.100- 07:10.500* :  since Dr. Mohammed Sukut, and there was no sterilisation. They suffered from vomiting and
*07:10.500- 07:16.200* :  diarrhea and weight loss, some had blood poisoning and severe infections. Back at a Shifa,
*07:16.200- 07:20.680* :  Israel released video as it comes under pressure to justify its raid on the hospital.
*07:21.320- 07:27.180* :  It says that tunnel leads to a blast-proof door of the kind used by Hamas for its command centres.
*07:28.340- 07:34.120* :  And more video, this time from security cameras, which Israel says, shows two hostages being
*07:34.120- 07:40.760* :  taken to a Shifa on the 7th of October, one of them wounded. At this stage, we can't verify any of
*07:40.760- 07:47.460* :  the military footage. For the families of the hostages, each day is an all-deal. But Qatar
*07:47.460- 07:53.220* :  brokered talks to try to free at least some of them in exchange for humanitarian pause in fighting
*07:53.220- 07:59.940* :  are increasingly said to be showing signs of progress. For garsens, any break in this war can't
*07:59.940- 08:07.220* :  come soon enough. Some 1.7 million are now displaced, most of the population. To add to their
*08:07.220- 08:13.800* :  misery, the territories now being lashed by strong winds and rain. And this is just the start of
*08:13.800- 08:20.660* :  the wintry weather. You learn now. To Ukraine now where the U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has
*08:20.660- 08:25.980* :  arrived to show his country's continued military support for Kiev. The trip comes amid
*08:25.980- 08:31.960* :  increasing division over aid for Ukraine in the U.S. Congress. Our correspondent James Waterhouse
*08:31.960- 08:37.620* :  is in Kiev. Valerie Sanderson asked him what Mr. Austin hopes to get across during his visit.
*08:38.260- 08:44.200* :  Well, that message is we're here for you for as long as it takes. I mean, we're told this was a
*08:44.380- 08:48.760* :  surprise visit. These things are typically choreographed. He got off the train
*08:49.780- 08:55.720* :  from the border to the sound of Kelusha Orchestra on the Tanoi. That's Ukraine's Eurovision
*08:55.720- 09:02.240* :  Champions of two years ago. No press conference is being laid on, so we don't have to the chance to
*09:02.240- 09:07.920* :  ask how that age is going to be delivered and what guarantees the U.S. can give beyond the
*09:07.920- 09:14.260* :  presidential election of next year, which Ukraine is sort of keeping a nervous eye on. Nevertheless,
*09:14.260- 09:19.880* :  this is a second sizable show of unity for Ukraine since the UK, New Foreign Secretary
*09:19.880- 09:26.620* :  Lord Cameron arrived last week. And I think this will be a welcome sight. I think there is a tricky
*09:26.620- 09:33.440* :  political backdrop here where the growing skepticism from Republican politicians has caused another
*09:34.080- 09:39.380* :  short-term funding agreement and not include new aid for Ukraine. But there is a quiet confidence,
*09:39.380- 09:47.400* :  it seems, across the Atlantic, that Western aid will continue for now. There are plans for new
*09:47.400- 09:52.620* :  long-range missiles down the line. It is the U.S., which provides the biggest amount of
*09:52.620- 09:59.260* :  military aid. More than $50 billion worth. It provides political cover for other Western allies,
*09:59.260- 10:06.140* :  which want to do the same. And so this will be a welcome sight. But President Zelensky has always
*10:06.780- 10:12.500* :  sort of had a gripe with the speed at which Western aid has arrived. And I think that's led to
*10:12.500- 10:17.380* :  accusations from his critics that he's appeared ungrateful. But nevertheless, this will be another
*10:17.380- 10:22.620* :  welcome visit as Ukraine embarks on a very difficult winter campaign. Yes, what is happening on
*10:22.620- 10:28.220* :  the ground in Ukraine? It depends on where you are, really, across the 1,000 kilometer front line.
*10:28.340- 10:34.360* :  The Ukrainian forces in the south have established the presence across the Nepro River on the
*10:34.360- 10:39.900* :  occupied eastern bank, which is significant, but it is a far cry from something resembling a bigger
*10:40.520- 10:47.520* :  push. It is forcing Russian forces to redeploy to an extent. But further round, certainly in
*10:47.520- 10:53.060* :  the Zapparizia region, where it was hoped at one point Ukraine would break through land offences.
*10:54.040- 10:58.920* :  Yes, there are continued gains being made, but we are still talking about a handful of kilometers
*10:59.600- 11:05.520* :  and a cluster of villages. Nothing to the extent, which would represent a sizable switching of
*11:05.520- 11:12.400* :  momentum in this conflict. James Waterhouse in Kiev. The Colombian singer Shakira has reached a
*11:12.400- 11:18.480* :  deal with Spanish prosecutors in a tax evasion case. She's agreed to pay a fine of seven and a half
*11:18.480- 11:24.400* :  million dollars. The singer has had an event for a few days. On Saturday, she won three Latin
*11:24.400- 11:30.580* :  Grammy Awards. Our correspondent Guy Hegeko is in Madrid. He told us more about the deal reached.
*11:30.840- 11:35.220* :  The authorities here in Spain had been claiming that between the years 2012 and 2014,
*11:35.340- 11:42.180* :  Shakira had been essentially living residing in Spain and that, therefore, she should pay taxes
*11:42.540- 11:48.300* :  on money earned during that time. This case was going to be all about proving that she had spent
*11:48.300- 11:53.040* :  a certain amount of time in Spain during that time. The prosecutors were asking for an eight-year
*11:53.040- 11:58.780* :  jail term for Shakira, as well as a hefty fine. In the end, what she agreed to, and she has
*11:58.780- 12:05.140* :  acknowledged now that she did spend enough time in Spain to owe those taxes. So she has
*12:05.580- 12:12.580* :  agreed to a three-year prison sentence, but she will not serve any jail time at all. And then
*12:12.580- 12:20.140* :  also she has agreed to pay around seven million euros in fines, as well. So she has essentially
*12:20.140- 12:25.620* :  acknowledged wrongdoing, but she's not facing the kind of consequences that she might have done
*12:25.620- 12:29.000* :  if she'd gone through a lengthy trial. Guy Hegeko.
*12:32.500- 12:38.040* :  Coming up in this podcast in Northern India, the race to rescue 41 men who've been stuck
*12:38.040- 12:43.660* :  underground in a tunnel for eight days. We're doing a lot of work at the moment to make sure
*12:43.660- 12:47.660* :  what we do is safe. I've just been down in the tunnel and enormous amount of work's been done
*12:47.660- 12:48.500* :  there in preparation.
*12:54.200- 12:58.920* :  Every weekday morning, wake up to one big story from the African continent.
*12:59.140- 13:04.660* :  Where does Africa stand in this conflict? How is Africa responding to the refugee crisis?
*13:04.660- 13:11.200* :  With me, Alan, Kassutja, and Africa Daily. So what's it like living in an area where Boko Harama
*13:11.200- 13:15.200* :  active? One story from Africa. For Africa. Our story.
*13:15.680- 13:21.740* :  Africa Day. That's Africa Daily from the BBC World Service. Find it wherever you get to
*13:21.740- 13:27.940* :  BBC Podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast.
*13:28.440- 13:34.220* :  Now to India, where officials are warning that 41 construction workers who've been stuck in a
*13:34.220- 13:39.540* :  collapse tunnel in Northern India for more than eight days may be stuck there for some time longer.
*13:40.100- 13:44.940* :  Fresh drilling is underway to try to reach the men, but concern is mounting for their health.
*13:45.440- 13:50.020* :  Supplies of oxygen, water and food are being sent underground to them via a pipe,
*13:50.600- 13:54.220* :  but families have complained that the rescue operation is too slow.
*13:54.460- 14:00.220* :  The president of the International Tunneling and Underground Space Association, Professor Arnold Dixon,
*14:00.740- 14:04.460* :  was called in to help the rescue efforts. He's been at the site since Sunday.
*14:05.180- 14:09.660* :  We're doing a lot of work at the moment to make sure what we do is safe and making sure
*14:09.660- 14:13.980* :  that the people do in the evacuation are safe. And I've just been down in the tunnel,
*14:13.980- 14:18.020* :  a enormous amount of work's been done there in preparation. And we're just coming up here on
*14:18.020- 14:23.640* :  top of the mountain to consider other options as well. The BBC's Zubea Ahmed has just visited the
*14:23.640- 14:28.860* :  area in the Himalayan foothills. Everything is getting delayed because the machines that are
*14:29.060- 14:34.960* :  drilling into the falling debris have not been working properly. They have developed some
*14:35.020- 14:40.180* :  snags, and that is why the delay is happening though. After all these failed attempts,
*14:40.720- 14:45.000* :  now the authorities say that drilling will happen at five different places on the mountain,
*14:45.000- 14:50.200* :  and the authorities hope that one of the five options should help rescue workers
*14:50.200- 14:55.800* :  reach the trapped workers inside. But if five places are being drilled,
*14:55.800- 15:00.400* :  are there dangers involved in that? This is the question we asked the people involved,
*15:00.400- 15:05.000* :  and one of them I spoke to yesterday. He said that there are no dangers at all.
*15:05.000- 15:10.700* :  One of the areas is already being drilled, and that has developed a little bit of cracks inside
*15:10.700- 15:17.600* :  the tunnel, but they say that it is safe. They have to go ahead of the experts. But we have seen
*15:17.600- 15:23.940* :  that the first drilling that was happening, they told us that the debris started falling from
*15:23.940- 15:28.920* :  the roof of the tunnel, and that is why it was stopped also because the machine stopped working.
*15:29.200- 15:34.760* :  We know food is being delivered underground to the workers via a pipe. Do we know about their
*15:34.760- 15:40.320* :  condition? We spoke to some of the family members whose relatives are trapped inside, and
*15:40.940- 15:45.320* :  some of them they say that they are all right. Thichologically they are feeling a little bit down,
*15:45.800- 15:51.180* :  and they are nervous because as things are getting delayed, they are also becoming more and more
*15:51.180- 15:58.260* :  worried. They are being sent even medicines through this pipe which is being used to send oxygen,
*15:58.260- 16:06.440* :  water and dry food packets. There is some worry that if it gets delayed further, then there could
*16:06.440- 16:12.080* :  be some medical emergencies. And the families of the workers have been protesting, haven't they?
*16:12.360- 16:16.420* :  They have not been happy with the way it's been going. The delays have caused a wave of despair
*16:17.060- 16:23.500* :  among the families, and I spoke to some family members and they said the agonizing weight
*16:23.500- 16:30.260* :  is unbearable, and they said that they have come from far away places. They don't have places to
*16:30.260- 16:36.660* :  stay here because it's a remote area on the mountain, and there are no restaurants, no hotels,
*16:36.700- 16:44.680* :  and some of them are staying in people's homes, and I spoke to a family which has come from
*16:44.680- 16:49.480* :  West Bengal that she and her children are taking shelter in a temple, in a Hindu temple. The
*16:49.800- 16:56.720* :  authorities have taken note of it, and they announced yesterday that they were going to ensure
*16:56.940- 17:02.880* :  that these family members who have come from far off places, they should get some accommodation,
*17:02.880- 17:08.320* :  but I don't know where they will be accommodated because there are no proper hotels here.
*17:08.580- 17:14.440* :  Some of the hotels which were available are completely chalk a block because there are experts
*17:14.440- 17:19.920* :  who have come from other places, they are staying here. Generally, they have occupied other
*17:19.920- 17:23.600* :  hotels which were available, so there is no place for them to go.
*17:24.360- 17:29.860* :  Jabair Ahmed, speaking to Valerie Sonserson. Some of you may have been following the twists and turns
*17:29.860- 17:35.140* :  at the head of one of the world's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, a tech firm
*17:35.140- 17:41.500* :  called OpenAI, which created the popular chat GPT bot around this time last year.
*17:42.200- 17:48.440* :  Microsoft has now confirmed that Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, will be joining the tech
*17:48.440- 17:55.020* :  giant. Our technology editor Zoe Kleinman has more. It's been a wild weekend for the world of tech.
*17:55.020- 18:01.320* :  The sector was stunned when OpenAI boss Sam Altman was suddenly sacked on Friday night. He was
*18:01.320- 18:07.540* :  for many, the public face of AI and the firm's creation, the chatbot chat GPT, has been used by
*18:07.540- 18:13.080* :  thousands of millions of people. And then rumors flew that there was a scramble to reinstate him,
*18:13.080- 18:17.960* :  had the board made a big mistake. He was even pictured back inside the building last night,
*18:17.960- 18:22.920* :  but today it's been revealed that he will not be returning to the firm he co-founded with Elon
*18:22.920- 18:29.340* :  Musk and others in 2015. Mr Altman in stairs joins Microsoft, openAI's largest investor,
*18:29.720- 18:33.460* :  to lead a team that doesn't even exist yet, focusing on AI research.
*18:34.380- 18:39.600* :  Emmett Sheer, who co-founded the video game streaming platform Twitch, takes over as CEO.
*18:40.460- 18:45.220* :  But how many of his new team will be jumping ship with a rolled boss? There's a lot of support
*18:45.220- 18:49.980* :  for him on social media, with many cryptically sharing the same post, which reads,
*18:50.560- 18:52.760* :  OpenAI is nothing without its people.
*18:53.620- 18:59.540* :  Zoe Kleinman reporting, and we've just heard that nearly 500 employees of OpenAI have signed a
*18:59.540- 19:05.440* :  letter saying they may quit and join Sam Altman unless OpenAI's board resigns.
*19:06.000- 19:11.620* :  Let's return now to the Middle East. International pressure is growing on Israel to curb violence
*19:11.620- 19:18.100* :  by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. It's risen to unprecedented
*19:18.100- 19:24.400* :  levels, say, rights groups, since the October 7th atrocities by Hamas. There are also widespread
*19:24.400- 19:30.580* :  military closures being imposed on Palestinians in the territory, which campaigners call collective
*19:30.580- 19:39.360* :  punishment. Our Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman reports. Israeli settlers,
*19:39.360- 19:45.820* :  some in military uniforms, rifles in hand, fire on the Palestinian village of Al-Tawani.
*19:47.740- 19:56.460* :  The men approach Hafez Hureini outside his house. They shove him and he's pushed back towards his
*19:56.460- 20:02.360* :  front door. They follow me until they put me in the house and then they beat me up. I've come here to
*20:02.360- 20:08.660* :  see Hafez Hureini and his family. Just across the other side of the valley on the top of the hill,
*20:08.900- 20:14.160* :  there is an Israeli settlement. The villagers here say they have been repeatedly harassed and
*20:14.160- 20:20.880* :  attacked by the settlers who have come towards the village, smashing up property and also shooting
*20:20.880- 20:27.400* :  at them. What they're saying is this has got much worse since the 7th of October. They're all there's
*20:27.400- 20:33.560* :  no law. To be honest, no law. They took the law in their hand and they do whatever they want
*20:34.020- 20:38.260* :  and they took the advantage of the war just to implement whatever they can.
*20:40.840- 20:46.420* :  After Hamas' attacks from Gaza, Israel imposed widespread military closures on the West Bank
*20:47.060- 20:52.760* :  and campaignists think settler gangs are taking advantage trying to drive Palestinians off the land.
*20:53.520- 20:57.320* :  Eight Palestinians have been killed and dozens wounded in the last six weeks.
*20:57.920- 21:04.100* :  We're just outside Hafez's house here. There's one big tree at the top of the hill and on top of
*21:04.100- 21:11.660* :  that is an Israeli flag. It was put there by settlers on the 8th of October. That tree is on
*21:11.660- 21:17.060* :  Hafez's land and the other thing that then appeared was a tent on his land where there are now
*21:17.060- 21:22.800* :  Israeli soldiers protecting the settlers. And that's you just trying to walk onto your own land.
*21:22.800- 21:27.820* :  Yeah, yeah we can't. Being a kind of like more flag. You could be shot.
*21:31.460- 21:35.780* :  A day after the attack on Hafez, settlers were filmed entering the village again.
*21:36.520- 21:42.940* :  One armed with an assault rifle shot 28-year-old Zakaria Adra in what residents say was an
*21:42.960- 21:50.280* :  unprovoked attack. He remains critically wounded. And Israeli soldier is then
*21:50.280- 21:56.360* :  seen ushering the gunman away. It was insane. Like everyone's such shouting and afraid
*21:56.360- 22:02.020* :  and Zakaria's cousin Basil Adra filmed the shooting. This accidents together are
*22:02.020- 22:08.220* :  supported in indirect or direct ways by the state because it's it's agenda to make us
*22:08.220- 22:13.840* :  afraid of living here and we have to be displaced. They don't want to do it through buses or trucks
*22:13.840- 22:19.120* :  to put us in and take us out of here but they want to do it through this kind of violence.
*22:19.980- 22:25.100* :  There is a police investigation into the shooting say Israeli officials. But investigations
*22:25.100- 22:31.300* :  into settler violence rarely lead to prosecutions or proper accountability. The army says the
*22:31.300- 22:36.240* :  West Bank restrictions on movement are due to increased security concerns. There have been
*22:36.240- 22:41.700* :  several deadly Palestinian gun attacks against Israelis and a surge of Israeli military raids
*22:41.760- 22:46.400* :  into West Bank cities. Rights groups call the closures collective punishment.
*22:47.520- 22:55.060* :  Tom Baseman reporting. In Kenya, representatives from some 175 countries failed to reach a
*22:55.060- 23:01.640* :  consensus on the first ever treaty on plastic pollution. Every day more than 30,000 metric tons
*23:01.640- 23:07.620* :  of plastic leak into our oceans. And a report from the Worldwide Fund for Nature warns that the true
*23:07.620- 23:13.820* :  cost of plastic on the environment, health and economies can be as much as 10 times higher for
*23:13.820- 23:19.820* :  low-income countries. Davina Gupta has been speaking to Eric Lindbergh, the Global Plastics
*23:19.820- 23:24.040* :  Policy Manager at the Worldwide Fund for Nature who was part of the talks.
*23:24.920- 23:30.960* :  The discussions are around creating a global treaty that sets the regulations, the global rules
*23:30.980- 23:37.780* :  that can face out and eliminate the avoidable and problematic plastics that we don't need
*23:37.780- 23:44.120* :  and set requirements for all other plastics so that it is reduced, reduced and recycled.
*23:45.040- 23:49.580* :  But there is a debate about the production and controlling the production of plastic isn't it
*23:49.780- 23:55.000* :  for example, one camp which is led by Saudi Arabia of countries that have lodged petroleum
*23:55.000- 24:01.180* :  industries say they prefer on recycling and waste management rather than curbs and production.
*24:01.600- 24:07.560* :  How do you view that? That's definitely the case and many countries, the vast majority of
*24:07.560- 24:13.900* :  countries actually say that we need to regulate plastic pollution across the full life cycle.
*24:13.900- 24:19.780* :  We shouldn't tie our hands and be limited to only look at waste management and this vast
*24:19.780- 24:26.360* :  majority of countries seems to be ready to move ahead and establish a treaty while we then see
*24:26.360- 24:32.040* :  this blockages and delay from a small group trying to hold the rest of the pack back.
*24:32.520- 24:38.880* :  You're saying it's a small group but how likely is it consensus then within this summit because
*24:38.880- 24:43.700* :  there have been two other summits trying to achieve exactly this? Yes, that's true and now we have
*24:43.700- 24:51.600* :  one year left. There wasn't any consensus on a plan moving forward last night and it's now
*24:51.600- 24:56.900* :  really crucial that in the lead up to the next meeting which will happen in Canada and April
*24:57.500- 25:03.140* :  and up to the last meeting happening in Republic of Korea next November the majority of countries
*25:03.140- 25:10.360* :  that want to see a treaty that wants a global treaty with regulations and not only a voluntary
*25:10.360- 25:17.080* :  nationally driven loose arrangement they must take this to much larger degree in their own hands
*25:17.080- 25:22.960* :  and be ready to move ahead despite the opposition. It's interesting that this summit is happening
*25:22.960- 25:27.740* :  in Kenya which has some of the toughest laws against production and use of single use plastic
*25:27.740- 25:33.760* :  including fines up to four years in jail term for law breakers. Now could relief be taken out from
*25:33.800- 25:38.800* :  this for a consensus on this treaty? Could there be some provisions which are punitive in action as
*25:38.800- 25:44.180* :  well? I think it's encouraging to see that countries from all over the world are leading on this
*25:44.180- 25:49.540* :  and you're right that Kenya is one of those and we see that actually in the talks as well that
*25:50.040- 25:56.680* :  these efforts are to large degree led by countries from Africa, from Latin America and small
*25:56.680- 26:03.140* :  island states. I think that that type of regulations that sets global bams and Kenya have said this
*26:03.140- 26:08.920* :  themselves it's difficult for them to enforce a ban when it's happening only in Kenya and when
*26:08.920- 26:14.180* :  the global plastics economy is moving ahead uncontrolled so these countries are calling for a
*26:14.180- 26:20.860* :  harmonization of these issues so that we have a common level playing field on plastic pollution.
*26:21.640- 26:27.740* :  Eric Lindbergh from the World Wide Fund for Nature. In our last edition we reported that one
*26:27.740- 26:35.360* :  of Emperor Napoleon's distinctive hats sold at auction in France for $2.1 million. Well clearly it's
*26:35.360- 26:41.300* :  Napoleon's season as you may have heard there's also a blockbuster movie about him that set to be
*26:41.300- 26:47.100* :  the film event at the end of this year. It's directed by Ridley Scott who was responsible for such
*26:47.100- 26:53.180* :  films as Alien, Gladiator and Blade Runner. In France where they have, shall we say, a certain
*26:53.180- 26:58.940* :  interest in the subjects that were awaiting the release with some unease. The critics and historians
*26:58.940- 27:06.740* :  who've seen it have not all been kind. Husco filled reports from Paris. It's a Ridley Scott
*27:06.740- 27:11.940* :  spectacular with battle scenes to die for and a love match between Napoleon and Josephine
*27:11.940- 27:18.220* :  that becomes the central theme. He's the Emperor who sacrificed happiness for glory. Joking Phoenix
*27:18.220- 27:24.880* :  as Napoleon is taciturn almost at times in articulate. I found the crown of France and the gutter
*27:26.560- 27:30.480* :  and placed it atop my own head. John critic Philippe Gadge of Le Poin.
*27:30.500- 27:38.460* :  Joachim Phoenix underplays Napoleon. Downplays it is almost as if Napoleon were a little shy boy,
*27:38.460- 27:46.080* :  someone who has very few words and very few expressions. The result is that we feel like Napoleon
*27:46.080- 27:48.820* :  in this film looks a little bit bland.
*27:52.940- 27:58.560* :  Noting his film in France Ridley Scott has been asked time and again about certain inaccuracies.
*27:58.560- 28:03.760* :  How could he have the young Bonaparte witness the beheading of Marianne Tournet?
*28:04.220- 28:08.960* :  And in Egypt, the shelling of a pyramid by the French army, it simply never happened.
*28:09.640- 28:13.400* :  Scott's answer has always been robust. Philippe Gadge again.
*28:13.700- 28:20.580* :  Ridley Scott is indeed very annoyed by that. Every time the French tells him about some of the
*28:20.580- 28:28.880* :  historical inaccuracies in the film, he really gets annoyed and almost angry. It was the case for
*28:28.880- 28:34.560* :  me too. He told me, where are you there? How can you know? As there have been 10,000 books about
*28:34.560- 28:42.140* :  Napoleon, the facts are not so clear and it concludes his words by the F word. So what can you say?
*28:42.300- 28:48.800* :  But what do you think is a critic? Does it matter? I mean, is it limitless, the amount that a director
*28:48.800- 28:57.220* :  can play with history? No, I don't think it can be limitless. I want to be as severe as some of
*28:57.220- 29:03.600* :  the French historians, but still, when you decide to name a film Napoleon, you have to be
*29:04.200- 29:10.040* :  faithful to the facts and the reality. You can shiddle a little bit when it comes to the
*29:10.040- 29:17.080* :  intimate scenes which have not been documented, but you cannot shiddle with the public events.
*29:17.940- 29:23.260* :  Are the critics a more indulgent to the British director? I asked Axel Gadge of So film magazine
*29:23.260- 29:28.660* :  if he thought historical accuracy mattered. I have a specific view on this. I don't think so,
*29:28.660- 29:33.720* :  because it's not an history book and you have history book, you have historic films as well,
*29:33.720- 29:38.560* :  you have everything you need about Napoleon, it's been written, it's been told, you know, it's not
*29:38.560- 29:45.340* :  a film for historical buffs, I think, and I think it's a good thing. You Scofield in Paris.
*29:48.540- 29:52.440* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast
*29:52.440- 29:58.320* :  later. If you want to comment on this podcast or the topics covered in it, you can send us an email.
