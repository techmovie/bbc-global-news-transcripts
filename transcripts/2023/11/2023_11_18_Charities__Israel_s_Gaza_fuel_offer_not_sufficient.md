*01:23.480- 01:28.400* :  Hello, I'm Oliver Conway. This edition is published in the early hours of Saturday 18th of November.
*01:29.000- 01:32.460* :  Israel agrees to allow two lorries of fuel a day into Gaza.
*01:32.820- 01:38.440* :  Aid workers say it's not enough. This is welcomed, but it still crumbs in relation to the
*01:38.440- 01:43.240* :  desperate need of 2.2 million people. The desperate need of hospitals and of bakeries and
*01:43.240- 01:49.100* :  of water treatment plants. Disagreements on Gaza on show as the Chancellor of Germany place host
*01:49.100- 01:57.840* :  to the Turkish president. There's no place for antisemitism in our country. It doesn't matter whether
*01:57.840- 02:04.940* :  it has grown here or comes into our country from abroad. And the US rapper Sean Diddy Combs is accused
*02:04.940- 02:12.060* :  of rape and sex trafficking by R&B artist Cassandra Cassie Ventura. Also in the podcast,
*02:12.660- 02:18.420* :  how important are Ukrainian gains on the Russian occupied side of the River Deneepro? And later.
*02:24.740- 02:28.340* :  The sailors using loud music to deter Orca attacks.
*02:34.440- 02:40.380* :  As well as doing battle on the ground in Gaza, Israel and Hamas are fighting a proper gander war.
*02:40.380- 02:47.140* :  The Hamas controlled health ministry says 24 patients died in 48 hours at the Al-Shifa hospital
*02:47.140- 02:53.080* :  because of power cuts. As Israeli forces search the facility for a Hamas command center,
*02:53.080- 02:58.420* :  the insist is hidden underneath. Israel says it's trying to avoid civilian casualties,
*02:58.420- 03:05.000* :  but hasn't been able to because Hamas is keeping people in harm's way. However, Israel has now agreed
*03:05.000- 03:12.240* :  to a US request to allow in desperately needed fuel to Laurie's day. But Bushra Khalidi from the
*03:12.240- 03:18.660* :  charity Oxfam says that is not enough. This is welcomed, but it still crumbs in relation to the
*03:18.660- 03:23.600* :  desperate need of 2.2 million people. The desperate need of hospitals and of bakeries and of
*03:23.600- 03:28.540* :  water treatment plants and power plants and all other civilian infrastructure that needs fuel.
*03:29.060- 03:34.360* :  And this fuel is not going to be allocated to operate these different infrastructures,
*03:34.380- 03:41.380* :  and therefore will leave 2.2 million people still at the risk of starvation and dehydration.
*03:41.420- 03:47.560* :  The Israelis say the strict limit is to prevent the fuel being used by Hamas. Elon Levy is a
*03:47.560- 03:52.260* :  spokesman for the Israeli government. We want to see humanitarian aid reach the people of Gaza,
*03:52.260- 03:58.240* :  but we will not allow Hamas to rearm and refuel its war machine against us, and that is our right,
*03:58.240- 04:03.580* :  and our obligation under international law to ensure that the enemy not to be allowed to rearm
*04:03.580- 04:07.480* :  and exploit the international community's goodwill in sending humanitarian aid.
*04:07.860- 04:13.160* :  Meanwhile, far-right members of Israel's coalition government have condemned the decision to allow
*04:13.160- 04:19.340* :  in any fuel. A US State Department official told the BBC that the first delivery under the deal
*04:19.340- 04:24.680* :  was meant to happen on Friday, but didn't because trucks were wrongly positioned on the Egyptian side
*04:24.680- 04:31.020* :  of the border. Shipments are now expected to begin on Saturday. However, 17,000 litres of fuel
*04:31.020- 04:37.340* :  were taken in on Friday via the UN Relief Agency Unroa, allowing mobile phone networks to be
*04:37.340- 04:43.160* :  partially restored after a blackout lasting more than 24 hours. UN agencies have been warning
*04:43.160- 04:50.000* :  that more fuel is desperately needed as conditions inside Gaza are dire. Juliet Tuma is from Unroa.
*04:50.320- 04:56.660* :  Every single day, the number of people who come to seek shelter in Unroa facilities is on the
*04:56.660- 05:04.220* :  rise. We have so far more than 800,000 people who continue to flock into these facilities in search
*05:04.220- 05:10.860* :  of safety, in search of humanitarian assistance, in search of protection. Our correspondent in Jerusalem,
*05:10.860- 05:16.000* :  Nick Beak told me more about what the various UN agencies have been saying about conditions in
*05:16.220- 05:21.460* :  Gaza. The warning from the World Health Organization is a pretty stark one. They're saying that
*05:21.460- 05:27.640* :  such is the concern about the spread of illness that if people aren't killed by fighting, they might
*05:27.640- 05:33.860* :  be killed by disease. That's why they say it's essential for medical supplies and other food to be
*05:33.860- 05:40.140* :  able to reach Gaza. Earlier on today, the United Nations Agency responsible for the Palestinian
*05:40.140- 05:45.700* :  refugees issued this very dire warning saying that in terms of their operations, they'd have to
*05:45.700- 05:50.980* :  cease because of a lack of fuel. Since then, of course, we heard the Israeli war cabinets say
*05:50.980- 05:57.000* :  that they were prepared to let two lorries every day reach Gaza. The United Nations have said
*05:57.000- 06:04.540* :  previously they need about 160,000 liters of fuel a day to perform their duties. These two lorries
*06:04.540- 06:11.000* :  the Israelis are promising, they would hold about 60,000. So maybe about the third of what the
*06:11.000- 06:16.040* :  United Nations say they need. And the Israelis want to make sure it doesn't fall into the hands of
*06:16.040- 06:21.040* :  Hamas. How are they going to do that? The lorries that do eventually arrive. They say this is something
*06:21.040- 06:26.280* :  which will be going to water desalination or so to try and address the real problem they've
*06:26.280- 06:31.280* :  had with us. The sewage works, which certainly has been spreading disease. And the Israelis, they say
*06:31.280- 06:35.880* :  they'll be monitoring this extremely carefully. I think they have to say that because there is some
*06:35.880- 06:43.020* :  opposition to this within domestic Israeli politics because the supply of food and fuel and water
*06:43.020- 06:48.800* :  and fuel in particular, it's been quite an interesting and probably important lever in these
*06:48.800- 06:54.360* :  hostage negotiations. So Israel doesn't want to be seen to be letting the flood gates open in
*06:54.360- 06:59.120* :  terms of fuel coming into Gaza, especially because they've said that any fuel that does get in,
*06:59.120- 07:04.760* :  there's a large likelihood that it will end up in the hands of Hamas. Nick Beak in Jerusalem.
*07:05.420- 07:09.600* :  Well, as you may have heard in our previous Global News podcast, the Turkish President,
*07:09.600- 07:14.380* :  Egypt type, Erdogan has been in Germany on a diplomatically sensitive visit,
*07:14.940- 07:21.340* :  sensitive because Germany and Turkey have opposing views over the war in Gaza. In a news conference
*07:21.340- 07:27.160* :  on Friday, Mr Erdogan criticized Israel's response to last month's brutal attack by Hamas,
*07:27.540- 07:33.640* :  saying shooting hospitals or killing children doesn't exist in the Jewish Torah. His host
*07:33.640- 07:39.400* :  Chancellor Olaf Schultz reiterated Germany's commitment to Israel and said anti-Semitism wouldn't
*07:39.400- 07:44.960* :  be tolerated anywhere. Well, I got an update on Mr Erdogan's visit from Damian McGinnis in Berlin.
*07:45.260- 07:51.200* :  What we just saw was a news conference between President Erdogan and German Chancellor Olaf Schultz,
*07:51.620- 07:55.740* :  and what we saw in this news conference with President Erdogan, the message that he wanted to
*07:55.740- 08:02.080* :  give was that he wanted to call for a humanitarian pause as he put it and it's in that spirit that
*08:02.200- 08:07.720* :  the Turkish leader said that he wanted Germany and Turkey, each on either side of the debate,
*08:07.720- 08:12.360* :  if you like, to work together to call for a ceasefire. And do the differences between the leaders?
*08:12.360- 08:17.460* :  Do they filter down to the ordinary population? Are we seeing disagreements within Germany?
*08:17.780- 08:24.720* :  The conflict in Gaza is really dividing society about what to do. A lot of people calling for
*08:24.720- 08:29.900* :  a ceasefire. There are a lot of people here with links to, but you also have a lot of people who
*08:29.900- 08:34.980* :  feel passionately in support of the Palestinian cause. Also in Germany, though, because of Germany's
*08:34.980- 08:40.980* :  historical guilt of the Holocaust, support for Israel is a key foreign policy aim, and it's a
*08:41.200- 08:46.100* :  deep part of German culture. It's a founding principle of modern Germany. It's how most
*08:46.100- 08:52.480* :  Germans are brought up with the idea of fighting anti-Semitism in whatever way shape or form that
*08:52.480- 08:58.040* :  can be. It's a big part of education here. There is a deep commitment to the existence of the
*08:58.040- 09:04.360* :  Israeli state. Demian McGinnis in Berlin. Meanwhile, the White House has condemned Elon Musk,
*09:04.360- 09:09.940* :  the world's richest person, for apparently appearing to promote an anti-Semitic post on his
*09:09.940- 09:14.640* :  social media site X. He bought the platform last year when it was known as Twitter,
*09:14.640- 09:20.180* :  and has faced growing accusations that he tolerates hate speech on the site. Mr. Musk has
*09:20.180- 09:24.960* :  denied being an anti-Semite and argues he's allowed to say what he wants. His unorth America
*09:24.960- 09:29.760* :  correspondent Nomiya Igbo. This rare rebuke from the White House comes two days after the
*09:29.760- 09:34.720* :  controversial billionaire Elon Musk was accused of crossing a line. He responded with the words
*09:34.720- 09:40.000* :  the actual truth, to oppose that expressed an anti-Semitic view, which is promoted by far
*09:40.000- 09:46.020* :  right conspiracy theorists and neo-Nazis. A White House spokesman said it was unacceptable to
*09:46.020- 09:51.220* :  repeat a hideous lie at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish
*09:51.220- 09:56.680* :  people since the Holocaust. Zahid the Amunala is a senior fellow at the Institute for Strategic
*09:56.680- 10:01.840* :  Dialogue, a British counter extremism think tank. What's alarming about Elon's response to this
*10:01.840- 10:07.200* :  particular post is that this post is using the explicit language that has been used in the past to
*10:07.200- 10:12.400* :  justify violent attacks on synagogues, so we're trading on dangerous ground here. The EU Commission
*10:12.400- 10:18.260* :  has become the latest to say it will stop advertising on X, citing what it called an alarming
*10:18.260- 10:23.900* :  increase in disinformation and hate speech. The chief executive of the social media site Linda
*10:23.900- 10:30.380* :  Yaccarino has said X is a platform for everyone and discrimination should stop across the board.
*10:33.380- 10:38.280* :  With the European Union warning of possible genocide in parts of Sudan,
*10:38.280- 10:43.700* :  there'll be a renewed effort in the Egyptian capital Cairo this weekend to discuss how to bring
*10:43.700- 10:49.340* :  peace and aid to Sudan. For the past seven months, the country has been embroiled in a brutal war,
*10:49.340- 10:55.340* :  leaving at least 24 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Access to the country
*10:55.340- 11:01.360* :  is extremely difficult, but the BBC's Mohammed Osman traveled to Port Sudan and a warning that
*11:01.360- 11:09.140* :  some listeners may find this report disturbing. In a makeshift shelter, how it's trying to scrape
*11:09.140- 11:12.200* :  together a family meal with the remains of the nations.
*11:16.900- 11:23.860* :  This 48-old mother fled here to Port Sudan with her five children when war broke out between
*11:23.860- 11:27.980* :  Sudan's army and the barren literary group Rabid Support Forces.
*11:30.880- 11:36.520* :  My children and I miraculously escaped death when our home in Ahmedurman was targeted at
*11:36.520- 11:43.060* :  explosion in the beginning of the war. At first, we stayed in the open for four days before finding
*11:43.060- 11:54.980* :  a shelter. They now live in a camp for internally displaced people. Currently, the situation is
*11:54.980- 12:00.360* :  very dire. We have nothing but God. There is only one meal a day. It's not enough,
*12:00.940- 12:06.680* :  so we divide it and eat it the next day. This has led to children getting food poisoning and the
*12:06.680- 12:13.820* :  area. However, it's one of more than five million people in Sudan who have lost their homes because
*12:13.820- 12:18.420* :  of the war. It's the largest number of internally displaced people in the world.
*12:20.700- 12:26.240* :  A feeling of hopelessness is growing among the people who live in this center. The fighting that
*12:26.240- 12:32.560* :  began in April is still going on and the families have no idea when might be able to retain home.
*12:34.360- 12:40.760* :  The younger generation are suffering the most. University of figures show that 700,000
*12:40.760- 12:48.620* :  children are now malnourished. Among them, the sick daughter of Zikra, a woman who fled
*12:48.620- 12:57.460* :  violence in Khartoum. She complains of vomiting, diarrhea and hernia. A hernia requires a surgeon
*12:57.460- 13:03.560* :  who is not available here. We came from Khartoum to put Sudan because of the war three months ago.
*13:06.280- 13:12.820* :  40 million children in Sudan need urgent humanitarian assistance according to United Nations figures.
*13:13.680- 13:18.660* :  90 million of them are predicted to be out for school by the end of the year.
*13:19.360- 13:26.740* :  Mandip Oprin is UNICEF representative in Sudan. This is devastating. The toll that this war
*13:26.740- 13:35.360* :  is taking on children is unacceptably high. The war needs to stop now for the sake of children,
*13:35.360- 13:42.160* :  for the sake of the future of Sudan. If the war continues by the end of this year,
*13:42.160- 13:48.920* :  the situation will be catastrophic. As fighting between rebel support forces and the Sudan
*13:48.920- 13:54.600* :  army carries on so dubious talks. But with little progress to date, the humanitarian
*13:54.600- 13:59.060* :  agency's fear, the situation will worsen before it gets better.
*13:59.560- 14:05.420* :  Mohammed Osman in Port Sudan. One of the most famous names in hip hop and rap,
*14:05.420- 14:11.200* :  the American music industry mogul Sean Combs, also known as PDD and Puff Daddy, has been
*14:11.200- 14:16.960* :  accused of rape and sex trafficking in a civil lawsuit, brought by a former long-term girlfriend,
*14:16.960- 14:23.680* :  the R&B singer Cassie. She is seeking unspecified damages. He has described the allegations as outrageous.
*14:23.680- 14:27.900* :  Our North America correspondent Shingai Nyokka in Washington has more details.
*14:28.360- 14:34.600* :  This is a civil suit, so this is not a criminal case. In her lawsuit, which was filed at a
*14:34.600- 14:40.400* :  federal court in Manhattan, Cassandra Ventura, who is a fairly successful R&B singer,
*14:40.400- 14:46.980* :  as well as model, says that in 2005, when she began a relationship with Sean Combs,
*14:47.040- 14:54.480* :  that is when the physical abuse began. And in her suit, she details this litany of accusations,
*14:54.540- 15:02.000* :  saying that he physically beat her, that he applied her with drugs, and also that he forced her to
*15:02.000- 15:09.440* :  have sex with multiple numbers of male prostitutes and videoed that. She says that in 2018,
*15:09.440- 15:15.220* :  which was shortly before they broke up, she alleges that he raped her. So these are very
*15:15.220- 15:21.960* :  serious allegations that she is making against him. His attorney has said that these allegations
*15:21.960- 15:29.160* :  were offensive, as well as outrageous. He says that for the past six months, Miss Ventura has been
*15:29.160- 15:36.300* :  trying to elicit $30 million US dollars from Sean Combs, and that he rejected that. They say that
*15:36.300- 15:41.980* :  this is her last resort, and it's her attempt at a payday. So effectively rejecting those
*15:41.980- 15:48.300* :  accusations, Sean Combs is one of the biggest hip-hop stars worth close to a billion dollars,
*15:48.300- 15:52.420* :  but this really could damage his reputation, depending on what happens next.
*15:54.600- 15:59.920* :  The British author, critic and poet, Dame As Biot, has died at the age of 87.
*15:59.920- 16:05.800* :  During an almost 60-year career, she became a highly regarded academic, and won numerous awards
*16:05.800- 16:11.320* :  for her novels. In a statement, her publisher Penguin Random House described her as one of the most
*16:11.320- 16:16.560* :  significant writers and critics of our time. She's best known for her work possession. David
*16:16.560- 16:25.400* :  Silito looks back at her life. The winner is A.S. Biot, possession. When A.S. Biot won the book
*16:25.400- 16:33.300* :  a prize in 1990, it was a transformative moment for a writer whose literary career had begun in the
*16:33.320- 16:38.700* :  60s. I really had persuaded myself that I wasn't going to win, it seemed the only way to keep sane,
*16:38.820- 16:44.320* :  and so I now feel somewhat shaky and totally overcome to be truthful. However, the demands of literary
*16:44.320- 16:51.100* :  celebrity were not her thing. An intellectual who enjoyed solitude, her prize-winning novel possession
*16:51.120- 16:57.020* :  was a reflection of her character, with its mix of academia and Victorian literary mystery.
*16:57.440- 17:02.020* :  I did learn something from Umberto Eco. He wrote a detective story at the same time as a sort of
*17:02.020- 17:07.220* :  brilliant intellectual game about the medieval world, and I suddenly thought I could have my
*17:07.220- 17:13.320* :  cake and eat it. Her full name was Dame Antonia Susan Duffy, but even to her grandchildren,
*17:13.320- 17:20.980* :  she was A.S. Biot was her first husband's surname, and she'd been born Antonia Drabel,
*17:21.180- 17:26.280* :  her sister, the acclaimed novelist Margaret Drabel. The relationship between the two sisters
*17:27.020- 17:32.740* :  was not without its tensions. Born in Sheffield, she said she hated being a child,
*17:32.740- 17:39.160* :  but while she had a reputation for being serious, she didn't think that was necessary for great literature.
*17:39.300- 17:45.040* :  You can be PG Woodhouse, and you are totally a classic. I also think Terry Pratchett is a classic
*17:45.040- 17:49.940* :  though it's too early to say so, for exactly the same reason his sentences are absolutely wonderful.
*17:50.140- 17:56.440* :  Her heroes were George Elliott and Jane Austen, and her life was devoted to the pleasures of writing,
*17:56.460- 18:02.420* :  and you could see it all in possession, a clever literary page turner.
*18:02.800- 18:06.480* :  David Sillato, on A.S. Biot, who's died at the age of 87.
*18:09.420- 18:11.300* :  Still to come on the Global News podcast?
*18:11.780- 18:19.780* :  Is so fascinating, revered, hated, and more famous probably than any man or leader of politician history?
*18:20.240- 18:23.580* :  We hear from the director of the new film about Napoleon Bonaparte.
*18:32.060- 18:37.800* :  Ukraine says it has secured several positions on the Russian occupied side of the river Deneepro.
*18:38.380- 18:43.340* :  The invaders retreated to the eastern side of the river after Ukraine retook her son a year ago.
*18:43.340- 18:47.340* :  The southern city has found itself pounded by a Russian artillery for months.
*18:47.340- 18:51.520* :  Both Ukraine and Russia claim to have inflicted heavy losses in the latest fighting.
*18:51.520- 18:56.160* :  I heard more about the geographical significance of this territory claimed by Ukraine
*18:56.160- 18:58.660* :  from our Europe Regional Editor, Danny Abard.
*18:59.080- 19:02.220* :  Looking at the river Deneepro, which is one of Europe's mightiest rivers,
*19:02.220- 19:04.300* :  it's a formidable obstacle for Ukraine.
*19:04.300- 19:08.600* :  It flows south-west, and so the south-eastern side is controlled by Russia,
*19:08.600- 19:10.660* :  the northwest side by Ukraine.
*19:11.220- 19:15.580* :  There's been a crossing over to the lower side on the Russian controlled side.
*19:15.580- 19:17.560* :  There's some villages that are fighting there.
*19:17.960- 19:20.780* :  This area, Oli, to give you some sort of context,
*19:20.920- 19:25.080* :  is much closer to the neck of the Crimean Peninsula than other areas of the front.
*19:25.120- 19:28.340* :  So it's about 85 kilometers away from the neck of the Crimean Peninsula.
*19:28.340- 19:32.440* :  That's half the distance from where the front is in Zapparicia in the south.
*19:32.540- 19:36.360* :  Why are we hearing now that they've actually gained something of a foothold there?
*19:36.480- 19:41.520* :  So there have been incursions by reconnaissance and sabotage groups across the Deneepro
*19:41.760- 19:43.780* :  since the spring, particularly in the summer.
*19:44.140- 19:47.140* :  This is more significant, perhaps, for two reasons.
*19:47.140- 19:50.220* :  One is that there seems to be more people have made this crossing.
*19:50.220- 19:52.080* :  We're talking, perhaps, of hundreds of Marines.
*19:52.760- 19:54.760* :  And secondly is the profile that it's been given.
*19:54.760- 19:59.220* :  So President Zelensky himself has posted photos that purportedly show crossing
*19:59.220- 20:01.580* :  by Marines in small boats.
*20:01.920- 20:04.400* :  This gives an impression of Ukrainian movement.
*20:04.400- 20:07.960* :  Ukraine has been struggling with a counteroffensive.
*20:07.960- 20:11.300* :  There's been a disagreement at the top level of the Ukrainian command
*20:11.300- 20:13.640* :  about whether or not it is a stalemate.
*20:13.940- 20:16.420* :  And it helps to provide the image, certainly abroad,
*20:16.420- 20:19.240* :  that Ukraine's offensive is still having successes.
*20:19.240- 20:24.400* :  And this, it's hoped, will help Western allies keep the military funds up to Ukraine.
*20:24.400- 20:28.260* :  The Russians think it's an obituary for the Ukrainian soldiers there.
*20:28.680- 20:30.640* :  Deneepro are your regional editor.
*20:31.460- 20:33.860* :  Thousands of young Australians have taken to the streets,
*20:33.860- 20:36.380* :  campaigning for more action on climate change.
*20:36.800- 20:38.980* :  Many of them skipped school to join the rallies.
*20:39.500- 20:40.480* :  What do we want?
*20:40.480- 20:41.280* :  Just it!
*20:41.320- 20:42.320* :  Where do we want it?
*20:42.420- 20:42.820* :  Yeah!
*20:43.140- 20:45.200* :  It's time to shift the power away from fossil fuels.
*20:45.260- 20:47.320* :  Or else we're going to be seeing more and more bushfires,
*20:47.320- 20:48.680* :  more and more heatwaves.
*20:48.980- 20:50.660* :  We all know what it felt like in 2019,
*20:50.660- 20:52.740* :  when the massive bushfires swept through Australia.
*20:53.040- 20:55.640* :  And the Labour government is simply just pouring more fuel on the fire
*20:55.640- 20:57.680* :  by approving new calling gas in Australia.
*20:58.040- 20:59.940* :  If we continue this way,
*21:00.340- 21:01.680* :  none of us are going to have a future.
*21:01.960- 21:04.900* :  Well, the government in Australia has promised to cut emissions
*21:04.900- 21:08.160* :  and make the country a renewable energy superpower.
*21:08.760- 21:11.000* :  Our correspondent in Sydney, Phil Mercer,
*21:11.340- 21:13.940* :  told the newsrooms Nick Kureshi, more about the protests.
*21:14.400- 21:17.540* :  Well, they were pretty big from Perth in the west of Brisbane
*21:17.540- 21:20.420* :  and Sydney here in the east to
*21:20.840- 21:22.520* :  have lead in South Australia.
*21:22.520- 21:25.500* :  So thousands of school children skipping classes,
*21:25.900- 21:28.720* :  some of them armed with this symbolic sick note
*21:28.960- 21:31.620* :  signed by eminent climate scientists,
*21:31.620- 21:33.840* :  saying that it was their recommendations
*21:33.880- 21:39.160* :  that students take a sick day to protest for a sick planet.
*21:39.160- 21:41.520* :  The Education Minister Jason Claire
*21:42.080- 21:45.060* :  said that while he wanted Australia's children to be passionate
*21:45.060- 21:46.660* :  and to care about the future,
*21:46.820- 21:50.220* :  he also wanted them at school and school said
*21:50.220- 21:53.420* :  that they wouldn't be accepting this symbolic sick note.
*21:53.420- 21:56.400* :  Many of the protesters took along with them to school
*21:56.860- 21:57.900* :  and later to the rallies.
*21:58.320- 22:01.000* :  Many seeing that government in Canberra
*22:01.000- 22:03.020* :  not doing enough despite what they say.
*22:03.560- 22:06.700* :  An election here in Australia in May of 2022
*22:06.700- 22:10.560* :  was widely seen as Australia's climate election.
*22:10.880- 22:13.020* :  The Labour government came to power,
*22:13.020- 22:15.920* :  promising that Australia would no longer be
*22:15.920- 22:18.900* :  the international community's climate laggard,
*22:18.900- 22:21.980* :  promising bold environmental policies
*22:21.980- 22:25.320* :  to cut emissions and also to make Australia's
*22:25.320- 22:28.700* :  transition to a renewable energy superpower.
*22:28.980- 22:31.820* :  Much faster there are people who believe that the government
*22:31.820- 22:33.420* :  hasn't kept its promises.
*22:33.900- 22:36.560* :  We've had the black summer fires of 2019.
*22:36.560- 22:39.560* :  20 followed by very serious floods
*22:39.600- 22:42.920* :  and this summer is forecast to be very hot
*22:42.920- 22:47.480* :  and a bit of a scorcher fueled by the El Niño weather pattern.
*22:47.480- 22:52.020* :  So certainly climate change is very much a burning issue,
*22:52.020- 22:55.140* :  not only among the young but among many Australians.
*22:55.720- 22:57.280* :  Phil Mercer talked to us from Sydney.
*22:57.960- 23:01.320* :  The presidential ambitions of the jailed Senegalese
*23:01.320- 23:06.080* :  opposition leader Usman Tsonko have suffered another major setback
*23:06.520- 23:09.620* :  after the Supreme Court annulled a lower court's decision
*23:09.620- 23:12.540* :  ordering that he be reinstated on the electoral role.
*23:13.260- 23:16.040* :  In a separate ruling, the Court of the Regional Block Ecos
*23:16.060- 23:20.440* :  ruled that the Senegalese government hadn't violated Mr Tsonko's rights.
*23:20.960- 23:23.520* :  The details from our Africa Regional Editor Richard Hamilton.
*23:23.920- 23:26.160* :  These are major blows to Usman Tsonko,
*23:26.460- 23:27.820* :  but it's not the end of the road.
*23:27.820- 23:30.740* :  The Supreme Court annulled the lower court's ruling,
*23:31.200- 23:34.320* :  but asked for the case to be heard again by a Court of Appeal
*23:34.320- 23:35.500* :  in the capital Dakar.
*23:36.040- 23:40.380* :  Over the past two years Mr Tsonko has faced a flurry of legal cases
*23:40.820- 23:42.920* :  for charges including libel and rape.
*23:43.380- 23:47.720* :  The latter provoked violent protests which left at least 16 people dead
*23:47.720- 23:49.040* :  and hundreds injured.
*23:49.040- 23:54.060* :  In July, he was arrested for insurrection and struck off the electoral role.
*23:54.060- 23:58.300* :  He's denied all these charges, saying they're aimed at preventing him
*23:58.540- 24:00.900* :  from running in the election next February.
*24:01.280- 24:01.900* :  Richard Hamilton.
*24:02.740- 24:06.560* :  It's the biggest sporting sanction in the history of the English Premier League.
*24:06.560- 24:11.440* :  Everton Football Club have been deducted 10 points for breaching financial rules.
*24:12.400- 24:17.220* :  It means they've dropped from the relative safety of mid-table to second from bottom
*24:17.220- 24:19.400* :  and facing the real danger of relegation.
*24:19.560- 24:21.880* :  Our football expert Nigel Adley told me more.
*24:22.180- 24:25.700* :  They are a club who have never been relegated from the highest level,
*24:25.700- 24:29.120* :  so this could have very far-reaching consequences for a club
*24:29.120- 24:32.480* :  who are currently trying to go through a takeover,
*24:32.480- 24:34.740* :  which is currently under review from the Premier League.
*24:34.880- 24:37.700* :  And they're also building a new stadium in Liverpool,
*24:37.700- 24:41.180* :  but really it has been poor management off the field,
*24:41.180- 24:43.280* :  which has led to the points deduction,
*24:43.320- 24:46.960* :  because the Independent Commission set up by the Premier League
*24:46.960- 24:47.960* :  as basically said.
*24:48.060- 24:49.500* :  The club were living beyond their means.
*24:49.500- 24:51.580* :  They were overspending on players.
*24:51.580- 24:54.040* :  They weren't getting enough money in from transfers,
*24:54.040- 24:56.800* :  because other clubs didn't want to pay the fees they want.
*24:56.800- 25:00.660* :  And due to relatively poor league performance in recent years,
*25:00.660- 25:03.320* :  money wasn't coming back into them from the Premier League.
*25:03.320- 25:06.140* :  And so they were breaching the sustainability rules,
*25:06.140- 25:08.140* :  and that's led to a 10-point deduction.
*25:08.320- 25:13.020* :  You just explain how those rules work and how Everton fell foul of them.
*25:13.100- 25:16.360* :  The Premier League decided that clubs can incur losses
*25:16.360- 25:20.760* :  of around $130 million over three years.
*25:21.180- 25:25.280* :  Everton's accounts to the end of the 2022 season
*25:25.280- 25:28.940* :  showed their losses were around $150 million,
*25:29.100- 25:31.980* :  and that's why they had admitted a breach
*25:32.160- 25:34.860* :  of the profitability and sustainability rules.
*25:34.860- 25:38.560* :  And the Premier League threw this across to an independent panel,
*25:38.560- 25:42.400* :  and they believe that Everton were living beyond their means.
*25:42.400- 25:47.180* :  And although $20 million is only a fraction of their overall turnover,
*25:47.180- 25:50.400* :  I think the Premier League believed they had to draw the line somewhere.
*25:50.600- 25:53.160* :  Everton will be appealing, and they've said they are shocked
*25:53.460- 25:55.300* :  and disappointed with the outcome.
*25:55.680- 25:59.920* :  Now lots of fans who've been commenting on the BBC website pages
*26:00.180- 26:03.440* :  say, watch out Manchester City, you'll be next.
*26:03.440- 26:05.160* :  Will Man City be worried?
*26:05.440- 26:08.340* :  Well, it's a very interesting precedent, which has been set now,
*26:08.340- 26:10.500* :  because Everton received one charge,
*26:10.500- 26:14.120* :  relating to the profitability and sustainability rules.
*26:14.120- 26:18.160* :  Manchester City are currently facing 115 charges,
*26:18.500- 26:22.180* :  relating to a period between 2009 and 2018,
*26:22.180- 26:25.140* :  when they had been taken over by their current owners
*26:25.140- 26:26.620* :  from the United Arab Emirates,
*26:26.720- 26:30.440* :  and were very quickly building their club into the force they are now.
*26:30.440- 26:32.580* :  There's no outcome to their case at the moment.
*26:32.580- 26:36.260* :  It appears it may be a good deal more complex than Everton's.
*26:36.320- 26:39.900* :  It's also thought the Chelsea could soon be investigated as well
*26:39.900- 26:43.180* :  into payments which were made by their previous owner,
*26:43.380- 26:45.560* :  Russian billionaire, Roman Abramovich.
*26:45.560- 26:50.140* :  So a number of clubs will be looking at this Everton judgment very keenly.
*26:50.500- 26:54.480* :  Nigel Adely, increasing numbers of attacks on small boats
*26:54.480- 26:57.660* :  by killer whales in the seas of the Iberian peninsula
*26:57.660- 27:01.100* :  have prompted sailors to try an innovative solution.
*27:01.820- 27:05.900* :  There have been at least 100 reports of Orca attacks on small craft
*27:05.900- 27:06.780* :  this year alone,
*27:06.780- 27:10.920* :  but now fishermen are using loud music to fight back
*27:11.440- 27:12.980* :  as Alice Adely reports.
*27:20.060- 27:22.880* :  That's the sound of the Polish metal group Pathfinder.
*27:23.520- 27:26.840* :  Eastern European thrash metal isn't to everyone's taste,
*27:26.900- 27:29.900* :  so that's why some mariners have taken to playing it
*27:29.900- 27:33.580* :  through underwater speakers to try to combat the growing threat
*27:33.580- 27:38.080* :  from Orcas or killer whales who've come to terrorise small boats,
*27:38.460- 27:42.800* :  particularly in the strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco.
*27:42.940- 27:49.020* :  The narrow waterway is believed to be home to around 60 of the endangered Iberian Orcas
*27:49.020- 27:53.560* :  who are reported to have carried out around 100 attacks this year alone.
*27:53.580- 27:57.400* :  There are two theories, one that they started in 2020
*27:57.400- 28:01.240* :  as revenge after a creature called White Gladys
*28:01.520- 28:05.940* :  suffered a traumatic event involving either a fishing net or a collision.
*28:06.480- 28:10.620* :  The other is that the Orcas are simply playing with the boats and their rudders,
*28:10.860- 28:14.540* :  a boatyard in the fishing port of Barbate in southern Spain
*28:15.120- 28:18.180* :  has repaired around 40 sailing vessels since April.
*28:18.900- 28:21.580* :  Lou Lombardy is a fisherman who spoke to the BBC.
*28:22.160- 28:26.180* :  Playing with the rudders is a break the fiber and the rudders split on the backs
*28:26.440- 28:29.640* :  because it's floating, the orcas who are playing with it like from the bottom
*28:29.640- 28:31.520* :  and like playing with on the nose.
*28:32.100- 28:36.780* :  Scientists believe around 20 individual animals are indulging in this activity
*28:36.780- 28:42.060* :  and have started tagging the orcas so they can warn small boats to avoid the area.
*28:42.660- 28:47.500* :  In the meantime, sailors are sharing tips on a Facebook group called Orca Attack Report.
*28:48.000- 28:51.380* :  The official advice from the Spanish government is to leave at speed
*28:51.900- 28:53.460* :  or stick to shallow waters,
*28:54.120- 28:56.220* :  hurling that there's always trash metal.
*29:00.380- 29:02.180* :  A report by Alice Adely.
*29:03.220- 29:08.160* :  The British film critics have praised it but the French are less keen
*29:08.160- 29:12.500* :  with one saying it should be renamed Barbie and Ken under the Empire.
*29:12.980- 29:16.920* :  I'm talking about the film Napoleon from acclaimed director Sir Ridley Scott.
*29:16.920- 29:21.020* :  Our culture editor Katie Razzle has been talking to Sir Ridley
*29:21.440- 29:24.640* :  along with Napoleon's stars Joaquin Phoenix and Vanessa Kirby
*29:24.980- 29:26.460* :  ahead of the film's release next week.
*29:28.100- 29:31.600* :  On the set of the Napoleon, Sir Ridley Scott's 28th film,
*29:31.980- 29:35.560* :  a new take on the French Emperor and his Josephine, complete with horses,
*29:35.560- 29:39.200* :  cannonballs and spectacular battle scenes sometimes on ice.
*29:43.000- 29:45.740* :  I'm blessed with a good eye, I think that's my strongest asset.
*29:46.180- 29:47.460* :  I'm not built like other men.
*29:47.900- 29:52.700* :  He is so fascinating, revered, hated and more famous,
*29:52.700- 29:55.540* :  probably than any man or leader of politician history.
*29:55.800- 29:58.020* :  Clearly you have a fascination with history whether it's
*29:58.020- 30:00.340* :  gladiator Black Hawk Down, now Napoleon.
*30:00.900- 30:03.780* :  Some people are saying, oh, but he wasn't at Marianne
*30:03.780- 30:06.660* :  when it's guillotineing or she had short hair, not long hair.
*30:06.980- 30:08.180* :  You really want me to answer that?
*30:08.460- 30:08.760* :  I do.
*30:09.040- 30:12.100* :  Mancer, any historian, the first thing is we there.
*30:12.540- 30:13.340* :  Oh, he weren't there.
*30:13.900- 30:14.440* :  How do you know?
*30:14.600- 30:17.720* :  There's been 10,400 books written about Napoleon.
*30:18.080- 30:21.340* :  You can't tell me there's not 98% conjecture.
*30:21.700- 30:22.240* :  Give me a break.
*30:22.560- 30:25.200* :  I found the crown of France and the gutter.
*30:26.020- 30:29.060* :  You've got amazing reviews here and not such good ones in France.
*30:29.340- 30:31.120* :  Barbie and Ken under the Empire,
*30:31.720- 30:33.480* :  Vivla France with American accents,
*30:33.640- 30:37.180* :  and they're saying it's very anti-French and very pro-British.
*30:37.460- 30:39.200* :  The French don't even like themselves.
*30:39.800- 30:43.100* :  Okay, but what's interesting is the audience I
*30:43.100- 30:45.580* :  showed it to in Paris, they love it.
*30:45.800- 30:47.520* :  I've seen this.
*30:51.220- 30:53.380* :  The creative genius behind Blade Runner,
*30:53.560- 30:56.020* :  Scott was a celebrated director of Adverts
*30:56.020- 30:57.900* :  before he found success in Hollywood.
*30:58.440- 31:00.660* :  Gladiator won him a best picture Oscar,
*31:01.080- 31:03.080* :  but best director has always eluded him.
*31:03.400- 31:04.220* :  I don't really care.
*31:04.500- 31:05.180* :  You win one, one.
*31:06.800- 31:06.820* :  Napoleon.
*31:07.040- 31:08.940* :  Well, I'm a knight, so what else do you want?
*31:09.240- 31:11.840* :  For Napoleon, he's reuniting with Wachim Phoenix,
*31:11.980- 31:13.320* :  who was his Emperor Commodus.
*31:13.760- 31:14.580* :  You do have a name.
*31:15.520- 31:16.600* :  My name is Gladiator.
*31:17.180- 31:21.280* :  He cast me at a time when my career was just beginning
*31:21.280- 31:24.760* :  and he gave me this opportunity and, to be honest,
*31:25.040- 31:27.460* :  the studio did not want me for Gladiator.
*31:27.680- 31:31.560* :  In fact, Ridley was given an ultimatum and he fought for me.
*31:32.220- 31:34.900* :  Scott's now shooting Gladiator 2 in Malta,
*31:35.120- 31:37.880* :  with normal people's former scowl and Denzel Washington.
*31:39.820- 31:41.200* :  Why did you want to go back to Gladiator?
*31:41.540- 31:42.540* :  Why not? Are you kidding?
*31:42.680- 31:45.360* :  The biggest challenge of all is getting it on paper first.
*31:45.860- 31:48.120* :  Once on paper, it's relatively straightforward.
*31:48.560- 31:50.120* :  What does this costume you have on?
*31:50.440- 31:51.260* :  This is my uniform.
*31:51.740- 31:53.380* :  I love the French fifty-eight too long.
*31:53.500- 31:56.420* :  Scott shot Napoleon in just 61 days,
*31:56.420- 31:59.060* :  using up to 11 cameras at a time.
*31:59.420- 32:00.260* :  You want to be great.
*32:01.900- 32:04.040* :  You are nothing without me.
*32:04.260- 32:06.460* :  Vanessa Kirby, who played Princess Margaret
*32:06.460- 32:08.060* :  in the first two series of The Crown,
*32:08.360- 32:09.640* :  is Scott's Josephine.
*32:09.860- 32:12.180* :  You might do five big scenes in one day.
*32:12.500- 32:14.760* :  The first few days, I had to adjust to the pace.
*32:19.040- 32:20.260* :  How many films are you jogging at the moment?
*32:20.480- 32:22.420* :  Well, I'm doing Gladiator now.
*32:22.580- 32:26.660* :  I return next week to finish and then I've already wrecked
*32:26.820- 32:29.460* :  and I've written and I've cast the film I'm going to do next year.
*32:29.660- 32:30.300* :  What are you doing?
*32:30.300- 32:31.700* :  I'm not going to turn it, because, yeah.
*32:32.300- 32:34.320* :  You are 85. Are you going to just keep working?
*32:34.520- 32:34.760* :  Yeah.
*32:35.140- 32:36.720* :  What is the film you're most proud of?
*32:36.940- 32:37.820* :  And I like it more.
*32:38.200- 32:39.420* :  What would you say to your younger self?
*32:39.540- 32:40.240* :  I did pretty good.
*32:40.520- 32:42.920* :  Ridley Scott, talking to Katie Razzle.
*32:45.540- 32:46.760* :  And that is all from us for now,
