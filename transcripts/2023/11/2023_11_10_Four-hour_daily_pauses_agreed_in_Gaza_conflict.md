*01:19.220- 01:21.280* :  from the BBC World Service.
*01:22.240- 01:23.260* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson,
*01:23.260- 01:24.820* :  and in the early hours of Friday,
*01:24.820- 01:27.720* :  the 10th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:28.340- 01:31.680* :  Israel says it will observe for our pauses every day
*01:31.980- 01:34.560* :  in the war in Gaza after pressure from the US.
*01:35.200- 01:37.800* :  We believe that this is an important step
*01:37.900- 01:38.800* :  in the right direction.
*01:38.800- 01:41.220* :  We believe that it is a byproduct
*01:41.220- 01:42.680* :  of the US government
*01:42.680- 01:45.060* :  and this administration's efforts in the region.
*01:45.400- 01:48.060* :  It comes as a video of another two hostages
*01:48.060- 01:50.440* :  is released by Palestinian militants.
*01:50.920- 01:54.360* :  The kidnap father of the Liverpool footballer, Luis Diaz,
*01:54.680- 01:56.500* :  is released by Rebels in Colombia.
*01:57.120- 01:59.940* :  A new study finds that lightning is the main cause
*01:59.940- 02:02.240* :  of forest fires in the Northern Hemisphere.
*02:04.020- 02:05.580* :  Also, this podcast, White Taiwan,
*02:05.580- 02:09.000* :  is stepping up its military preparedness and...
*02:09.220- 02:12.780* :  I'm so sorry, but I am having such a parry-menopausal.
*02:12.780- 02:14.040* :  Ah, that's right there!
*02:14.280- 02:15.380* :  I've on it.
*02:15.720- 02:17.060* :  We need to make it normal,
*02:17.220- 02:19.420* :  and I love you for even saying it.
*02:20.000- 02:22.780* :  Praise for the contributor who experienced
*02:22.780- 02:24.900* :  a menopausal hot-flush an air
*02:25.360- 02:27.440* :  and described it to TV viewers.
*02:31.680- 02:33.640* :  The White House says Israel will implement
*02:33.640- 02:37.320* :  four-hour pauses every day in areas of Northern Gaza.
*02:37.820- 02:39.420* :  It's raised hopes of a respite
*02:39.420- 02:40.860* :  in more than a month of fighting,
*02:40.860- 02:42.980* :  which has left thousands of people dead
*02:42.980- 02:45.820* :  and increased fears of a regional conflict.
*02:46.360- 02:47.440* :  Speaking at a news conference,
*02:47.440- 02:50.720* :  the State Department spokesperson, Vedant Patel,
*02:51.020- 02:53.120* :  said it was part of ongoing U.S. efforts
*02:53.120- 02:56.200* :  to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*02:56.900- 02:59.500* :  We believe that this is an important step
*02:59.560- 03:00.500* :  in the right direction.
*03:00.500- 03:02.920* :  We believe that it is a byproduct
*03:02.920- 03:04.340* :  of the U.S. government
*03:04.340- 03:06.740* :  and this administration's efforts in the region.
*03:06.880- 03:10.440* :  Of course, we are going to continue to want to see more.
*03:10.640- 03:12.440* :  We have not parsed our words
*03:12.440- 03:15.900* :  about the dire humanitarian circumstances in Gaza,
*03:16.400- 03:17.800* :  and it's something that we're going to continue
*03:17.800- 03:19.900* :  to engage on with the Israelis
*03:19.900- 03:22.180* :  on what other avenues are available.
*03:22.720- 03:25.640* :  More details from our State Department correspondent,
*03:25.660- 03:26.900* :  Barbara Petashe.
*03:27.620- 03:30.060* :  These pauses seem to be very specifically related
*03:30.060- 03:33.100* :  to enabling civilians to leave Northern Gaza,
*03:33.100- 03:35.760* :  which is the focus of the Israeli military operation
*03:35.880- 03:38.760* :  and move down towards the southern part of the strip,
*03:38.760- 03:40.760* :  which is not so much in the line of fire.
*03:40.760- 03:43.180* :  So according to the Israeli defense forces,
*03:43.860- 03:46.280* :  they call it tactical local pauses
*03:46.780- 03:48.520* :  for movement from a specific area
*03:48.520- 03:50.120* :  that is in the north to the south.
*03:50.660- 03:52.860* :  And they are going to be four hours in duration.
*03:52.860- 03:54.540* :  We were told by the White House
*03:54.540- 03:57.040* :  there would be a three-hour alert ahead of time.
*03:57.420- 03:59.420* :  And they would cover very specific areas.
*03:59.420- 04:01.380* :  That is safe passage corridors.
*04:01.380- 04:04.560* :  There already existed one, but there's going to be a second one.
*04:05.020- 04:07.100* :  And the Israelis would basically guarantee
*04:07.100- 04:08.220* :  that during those four hours,
*04:08.220- 04:10.260* :  they would cease their operations in those areas
*04:10.260- 04:12.900* :  because in the past, Palestinians have gone down
*04:12.900- 04:14.400* :  and it's a safe corridor that existed
*04:14.400- 04:17.600* :  and it's still sometimes been hit by results of the fighting.
*04:17.600- 04:20.320* :  So that is the specific focus of this.
*04:20.320- 04:22.400* :  What the White House and the State Department are saying
*04:22.400- 04:25.820* :  is that they hope that this can be used in some way
*04:25.820- 04:28.880* :  as a start to try to get humanitarian pauses
*04:28.880- 04:32.400* :  for aid into the Gaza strip more than is already coming in.
*04:32.500- 04:34.780* :  And also maybe that they might be able to be used
*04:34.780- 04:36.720* :  for facilitating hostage releases.
*04:37.300- 04:39.260* :  It's come, hasn't it, after the U.S.
*04:39.260- 04:41.240* :  brought a lot of pressure to bear in Israel?
*04:41.980- 04:45.340* :  Yes, this is, I think, very much the result of U.S. diplomacy.
*04:45.340- 04:47.120* :  It's certainly something the State Department claims.
*04:47.120- 04:48.760* :  And I think they have a case there.
*04:49.240- 04:51.180* :  Secretary Blinken has been to the region twice.
*04:51.180- 04:53.200* :  He's been pushing, pushing, pushing to get
*04:53.560- 04:55.060* :  at least humanitarian pauses.
*04:55.240- 04:57.420* :  He has an envoy in the region, David Satterfield,
*04:57.420- 04:58.500* :  who's been doing the same.
*04:58.820- 05:00.600* :  President Biden has been actively engaged,
*05:00.600- 05:04.000* :  calling the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*05:04.160- 05:04.860* :  about this sort of thing.
*05:04.860- 05:06.520* :  He was asked today, in fact, Mr. Biden,
*05:06.520- 05:08.460* :  whether he had called for something much longer
*05:08.460- 05:12.580* :  for a three-day pause to facilitate negotiations on hostages.
*05:12.580- 05:14.680* :  And he said, yes, in fact, he'd asked for even more than that,
*05:14.720- 05:15.800* :  which he clearly didn't get.
*05:16.300- 05:18.680* :  He'd asked if he was frustrated with the Israeli Prime Minister
*05:18.680- 05:21.060* :  and he said, well, it's taken longer than I expected to,
*05:21.060- 05:23.800* :  which I think probably is a mild way of saying yes.
*05:24.540- 05:25.700* :  Barbara Pletasha.
*05:26.360- 05:29.100* :  Meanwhile, on Thursday, Palestinian militants
*05:29.100- 05:32.220* :  posted a video of two more of the Israeli hostages
*05:32.580- 05:33.660* :  being held in Gaza.
*05:34.220- 05:36.560* :  The footage was released as thousands more civilians
*05:36.560- 05:38.660* :  headed to the south of the Gaza Strip.
*05:39.080- 05:41.200* :  We'll get more on the video from our correspondent,
*05:41.200- 05:43.100* :  Paul Adams, in Jerusalem, in a moment.
*05:43.640- 05:45.920* :  But first, I asked him what Israel has been saying
*05:46.240- 05:48.000* :  about the humanitarian pauses.
*05:48.980- 05:51.760* :  Well, actually, the Israelis say that they are in effect
*05:51.760- 05:54.600* :  already implementing such pauses
*05:54.620- 05:57.000* :  and have been for two or three days.
*05:57.240- 06:00.360* :  I mean, we have seen they have kept that road open
*06:00.460- 06:03.840* :  that Barbara was referring to, a road that enables civilians
*06:03.840- 06:06.900* :  to move out of the kind of main fighting area
*06:07.140- 06:09.200* :  and down towards the south.
*06:09.360- 06:11.580* :  And that's something that has been announced ahead of time.
*06:11.940- 06:15.240* :  There's been a defined window of four, five,
*06:15.240- 06:17.020* :  and I think in one case, six hours
*06:17.120- 06:19.800* :  in which people could make their way safely down that road.
*06:20.020- 06:21.640* :  Question is whether this is going to be done
*06:21.640- 06:23.440* :  not just for the evacuation of civilians,
*06:23.440- 06:27.360* :  but whether people who are still in the northern part
*06:27.460- 06:29.480* :  in Gaza City and the surrounding areas
*06:29.840- 06:33.200* :  might have small opportunities to go out and find food and water.
*06:33.600- 06:35.800* :  I think that's something that perhaps the Americans
*06:35.800- 06:36.760* :  would like to see.
*06:37.280- 06:39.400* :  It is something perhaps the Israelis will allow,
*06:39.400- 06:42.440* :  but they haven't yet indicated that that is the purpose
*06:42.460- 06:42.940* :  of this.
*06:43.300- 06:45.620* :  Really no aid is getting into the northern part
*06:45.620- 06:46.480* :  of the Gaza Strip.
*06:46.740- 06:48.600* :  That is, you know, in effect, a war zone.
*06:48.600- 06:51.560* :  So all we're seeing there are these brief pauses
*06:51.560- 06:54.080* :  to allow people to get out and perhaps to find some food.
*06:54.540- 06:57.020* :  But in terms of aid trucks going into the south,
*06:57.020- 07:00.860* :  that is something which remains problematic and patchy,
*07:01.120- 07:03.300* :  but there are concerted by the Israelis,
*07:03.300- 07:06.960* :  the Americans and the Egyptians to try and increase that amount
*07:06.960- 07:09.680* :  because that's where the bulk of the Palestinian civilian
*07:09.680- 07:13.160* :  population is now, and it is in everyone's interests
*07:13.160- 07:16.060* :  that they're not starving or dying of thirst.
*07:16.740- 07:18.920* :  And Paul, what could you tell us about this video
*07:19.240- 07:22.820* :  of two hostages that's been released by Islamic Jihad?
*07:23.020- 07:26.760* :  So this is the smaller of the two main Palestinian factions
*07:27.400- 07:28.380* :  in the Gaza Strip.
*07:28.620- 07:29.880* :  Palestinian islamic Jihad.
*07:29.880- 07:32.320* :  They've released a video in which you see two hostages.
*07:32.460- 07:34.140* :  One is Hannah Katzeer.
*07:34.140- 07:36.080* :  She's a woman in her 70s.
*07:36.080- 07:37.620* :  She's sitting in a wheelchair.
*07:37.700- 07:41.660* :  She was abducted from Kibbutz near Oz on October the 7th.
*07:41.800- 07:45.120* :  And the second hostage is a 13-year-old boy,
*07:45.340- 07:49.140* :  Yagel Yakhov, who was also taken from the same community.
*07:49.740- 07:51.580* :  They're both speaking to the camera.
*07:52.060- 07:53.720* :  We do not know if they're reading a script
*07:53.720- 07:55.660* :  or speaking their own words.
*07:55.660- 07:59.000* :  They are both critical of Benjamin Netanyahu
*07:59.400- 08:01.180* :  for getting them into this situation.
*08:01.340- 08:03.360* :  But again, I should emphasize, we do not know
*08:03.360- 08:04.880* :  if these are their words or not.
*08:05.320- 08:08.240* :  And the Islamic Jihad also put out a statement
*08:08.240- 08:10.320* :  at the same time saying that the group was willing
*08:10.320- 08:12.180* :  to release both of these hostages
*08:12.180- 08:15.280* :  for what it called humanitarian and medical reasons.
*08:15.920- 08:19.160* :  But only if, again, what it called appropriate measures
*08:19.420- 08:19.660* :  were met.
*08:19.700- 08:22.660* :  And we do not know exactly what those measures are.
*08:22.980- 08:24.600* :  When this comes amid a lot of talk
*08:24.600- 08:27.260* :  and a lot of diplomatic effort aimed at trying
*08:27.260- 08:28.520* :  to get hostages released.
*08:29.140- 08:30.900* :  And it seems as though Islamic Jihad,
*08:31.380- 08:34.720* :  perhaps, wants to be part of any deal that is struck.
*08:35.480- 08:39.160* :  Paul Adams, more than one and a half million garrisons
*08:39.160- 08:42.000* :  are believed to have been displaced in the ongoing conflict.
*08:42.000- 08:46.140* :  And the UN estimates that about 45% of homes in Gaza
*08:46.580- 08:47.980* :  have already been destroyed.
*08:48.640- 08:51.040* :  One person whose life has been turned upside down
*08:51.040- 08:53.540* :  by the fighting is Abd al-Hakim Awad,
*08:53.920- 08:56.080* :  a 23-year-old social media manager
*08:56.080- 09:00.080* :  for the Gaza Sunburns Gaza's only para-cycling team.
*09:00.660- 09:02.500* :  His building in central Gaza is home
*09:02.500- 09:07.900* :  to about 400 people, 120 of them members of his own extended family.
*09:08.540- 09:11.200* :  He says he has no political affiliations.
*09:11.200- 09:14.480* :  We checked his social media and found no statements
*09:15.100- 09:15.680* :  supporting Hamas.
*09:16.360- 09:18.560* :  The BBC's Heber Bitter reflects now
*09:18.560- 09:20.660* :  on how his life has changed.
*09:21.680- 09:23.740* :  I know you don't know, I don't know.
*09:24.480- 09:27.000* :  Abd al-Hakim's home has just been hit.
*09:28.000- 09:35.940* :  Fear, confusion, darkness, the air thick with smoke.
*09:40.380- 09:43.660* :  Before the war, Abd al-Hakim worked for the Gaza Sunburns.
*09:43.960- 09:45.840* :  The strips only para-cycling team.
*09:46.340- 09:48.760* :  When Israel's missiles began to strike,
*09:49.140- 09:51.080* :  he turned to helping those in need.
*09:51.680- 09:53.740* :  Me and the young people of the Sunburns team
*09:54.040- 09:56.240* :  have raised money to provide urgent supplies.
*10:00.340- 10:02.240* :  Even our kids are helping to carry stuff.
*10:02.680- 10:05.100* :  People of all ages are helping to supply
*10:05.100- 10:07.840* :  and support the shelters across the Gaza Strip.
*10:10.360- 10:12.440* :  Many of the supermarkets and shops are closed,
*10:13.200- 10:14.320* :  so supplies are scarce.
*10:15.000- 10:17.000* :  But we managed to do a tour of all the shops
*10:17.000- 10:18.920* :  in the central area of Gaza City.
*10:19.880- 10:22.740* :  Although movement is risky with all the missile strikes,
*10:23.860- 10:26.820* :  we gathered blankets, groceries, and health products.
*10:27.820- 10:30.120* :  While we are still alive, we can still help.
*10:32.700- 10:35.160* :  That night, in the soil struck his apartment block
*10:35.160- 10:36.640* :  in the Buraj refugee camp.
*10:37.420- 10:39.840* :  It's a building that housed 400 people,
*10:40.360- 10:42.060* :  a quarter of them were family.
*10:45.500- 10:48.200* :  These rockets that landed on us were huge barrel rockets
*10:48.600- 10:50.780* :  that destroyed the whole area, including
*10:50.780- 10:52.300* :  a large part of my house.
*10:55.300- 10:56.880* :  We barely got out of the house.
*11:04.520- 11:06.860* :  I suddenly looked for my parents, my neighbors,
*11:07.360- 11:09.500* :  and all those around me and found no one.
*11:15.000- 11:16.240* :  Our cars were destroyed.
*11:16.860- 11:18.960* :  We used these cars to transport and distribute
*11:18.960- 11:21.280* :  the aid to people this place from their homes.
*11:23.460- 11:27.500* :  We lived every minute, every hour, surrounded by death.
*11:28.240- 11:29.940* :  This is the worst period we have lived
*11:30.380- 11:31.640* :  in all of the previous wars.
*11:34.540- 11:37.120* :  Israel is practicing genocide against us.
*11:44.500- 11:47.640* :  After almost two hours, I found a part of my family,
*11:48.320- 11:49.820* :  and I was able to reach them.
*11:50.360- 11:53.140* :  But till today, I haven't been able to get in touch
*11:53.140- 11:53.880* :  with my neighbors.
*11:56.000- 11:56.540* :  I'm civilian.
*11:56.700- 12:00.340* :  I'm not part of any organization, nor are my family.
*12:01.200- 12:02.940* :  But the bombing of our house is normal,
*12:03.560- 12:06.140* :  as is the bombing of the houses of all our neighbors.
*12:07.020- 12:10.500* :  An entire residential block, a whole neighborhood was bombed.
*12:12.460- 12:16.200* :  The buildings are now bare, exposed to broken floors.
*12:17.220- 12:20.040* :  The few cars that remain have been crushed by debris
*12:20.540- 12:22.560* :  and clothing is a stone all around.
*12:26.360- 12:28.640* :  The missiles don't show any mercy on anyone.
*12:29.500- 12:32.520* :  We found birds, cats, pigeons, all dead.
*12:36.000- 12:38.460* :  It wasn't long before the missiles struck again.
*12:38.660- 12:40.440* :  Four days later,
*12:41.300- 12:43.300* :  we heard the sound of rockets coming down.
*12:44.040- 12:45.220* :  We had been bombed before.
*12:47.060- 12:48.520* :  They killed an entire family.
*12:49.320- 12:50.520* :  Three or four families.
*12:55.500- 12:59.100* :  I've dealt Hakeem Awad ending that report by Heba Bitter.
*13:00.700- 13:02.600* :  Nearly two weeks after his abduction
*13:02.600- 13:04.300* :  spot, a major manhunt,
*13:04.600- 13:07.460* :  the father of the Liverpool football star, Louis Diaz,
*13:07.740- 13:11.000* :  has been released by a Colombian rebel group, the ELN.
*13:11.520- 13:13.820* :  Both his parents were kidnapped while they were driving
*13:13.820- 13:17.060* :  in the family's home town, Burancas, in northern Colombia.
*13:18.000- 13:19.220* :  His mother was freed within hours,
*13:19.580- 13:21.660* :  but his father, Louis Manuel Diaz,
*13:21.660- 13:23.960* :  was kept captive by the guerrilla group.
*13:24.500- 13:26.000* :  Our correspondent, Daniel Pardo,
*13:26.100- 13:28.600* :  told me more about the first TV pictures
*13:29.040- 13:31.860* :  of the release of the father of the famous footballer.
*13:32.860- 13:35.860* :  We just saw images of him getting of a helicopter
*13:35.860- 13:39.440* :  in which he was picked up by officials of the United Nations.
*13:39.500- 13:42.560* :  The ELN has said that they didn't know he was
*13:42.560- 13:44.880* :  the dad of this public international figure,
*13:45.300- 13:48.460* :  and that it wouldn't have done it if they knew that it was him.
*13:48.540- 13:51.220* :  And this is a quote, we all love Louis Diaz.
*13:51.240- 13:52.780* :  In the words, this was a mistake.
*13:53.100- 13:55.440* :  It was a calm sort of release day after day.
*13:55.440- 13:57.060* :  They said it was going to happen and it didn't happen.
*13:57.140- 14:00.240* :  And that is partly because they were in a very remote area,
*14:00.340- 14:01.500* :  in a mountainous jungle,
*14:02.100- 14:05.580* :  but also because this trust between the government and the ELN
*14:05.580- 14:07.660* :  is so huge, so historical, so profound,
*14:08.100- 14:11.560* :  that it's very difficult to think they're not going to arrest us
*14:11.720- 14:12.500* :  on top of that.
*14:12.600- 14:17.060* :  This is a guerrilla movement, which is trying to negotiate a piece deal
*14:17.060- 14:19.340* :  with the current government of Gustavo Petro.
*14:19.500- 14:21.960* :  The political implication of this is bigger.
*14:22.300- 14:25.940* :  Daniel, have they been asked about the circumstances surrounding
*14:26.140- 14:28.980* :  the negotiations behind his release,
*14:29.060- 14:30.780* :  and indeed, if a ransom was paid?
*14:31.100- 14:32.440* :  We don't know if a ransom was paid.
*14:32.440- 14:37.780* :  I would think that it wasn't because no one wins with this situation.
*14:38.160- 14:41.360* :  The ELN is trying to negotiate this piece deal.
*14:41.360- 14:43.140* :  And for them, they need credibility.
*14:43.220- 14:46.860* :  They need Colombians to think that they have intentions of peace,
*14:47.100- 14:51.020* :  intentions of demobilizing, intentions of stopping Kitna Payings
*14:51.240- 14:53.080* :  and drug dealing and so forth.
*14:53.420- 14:55.620* :  One of the questions now is what's going to happen
*14:55.620- 14:59.380* :  with these peace negotiation between the government and the guerrilla movement?
*14:59.380- 15:02.000* :  What Diaz has said, previous to the release,
*15:02.140- 15:04.460* :  is that he is not the only one.
*15:04.720- 15:07.320* :  The ELN has at least 30 people Kitnapped.
*15:07.800- 15:11.500* :  So he had his special treatment because of the fact that he is an international,
*15:12.100- 15:14.420* :  well-known figure that most Colombians love.
*15:14.700- 15:17.780* :  But there's still people Kitnapped by the ELN and other groups,
*15:17.780- 15:21.360* :  and it's important to understand that violence is still in place in Colombia.
*15:21.360- 15:24.340* :  It's not the same as it used to be in the 80s and 90s,
*15:24.400- 15:25.360* :  but it's still in place.
*15:25.360- 15:28.100* :  And Colombians are still trying to get peace to this country.
*15:28.720- 15:32.720* :  Daniel Pardo, if you're a woman suffering extremes of temperature,
*15:32.720- 15:36.080* :  perspiration and brain fog, you may have told workmates,
*15:36.100- 15:38.800* :  I'm sorry, I'm having a hot flush.
*15:39.640- 15:42.080* :  One woman did that, not just to the office,
*15:42.080- 15:45.740* :  but also to millions of people watching her live on air
*15:46.040- 15:47.920* :  on Australian national television.
*15:48.520- 15:50.240* :  Here's a clip from ABC News Breakfast.
*15:51.100- 15:53.020* :  The latest on the Prime Minister visit the China?
*15:53.700- 15:54.920* :  Yes, another pardon, Michael.
*15:55.260- 15:59.560* :  Big chill, but the PM doesn't pander yet.
*16:00.420- 16:03.220* :  So the bilateral meeting between Australia and China,
*16:03.420- 16:06.000* :  Anthony Albertese and Chinese.
*16:07.900- 16:10.740* :  I'm so sorry, I could keep stumbling through this,
*16:11.000- 16:14.180* :  but I'm having such a perimenopausal.
*16:14.180- 16:18.120* :  Right now, live on air, it's so soft.
*16:18.920- 16:21.860* :  The point about this is that we need to make it normal
*16:21.860- 16:23.900* :  to have these kinds of conversations,
*16:24.100- 16:26.800* :  and I love you for even saying it.
*16:27.940- 16:30.680* :  Well, the woman having the hot flush was Imogen Crump,
*16:30.680- 16:34.740* :  the editor of the University of Melbourne's research news platform,
*16:35.100- 16:35.560* :  Pursuit.
*16:35.940- 16:39.040* :  As you heard there, she's also a regular paper reviewer
*16:39.320- 16:42.660* :  on ABC's News Breakfast program in Australia.
*16:43.380- 16:44.900* :  Emma Barnett caught up with Imogen
*16:45.240- 16:47.540* :  and started by checking on her temperature.
*16:48.640- 16:49.960* :  My temperature is moderate.
*16:49.960- 16:53.480* :  Right now, I will let you know if it spikes as we go on.
*16:53.680- 16:55.840* :  It's a regular slot, but I do.
*16:56.060- 16:58.980* :  They'll have a journal who comes in and talks through the big stories.
*16:59.800- 17:02.020* :  It was quite a normal morning.
*17:02.020- 17:06.060* :  We were talking about the Australian Prime Minister, Anthony Albertese,
*17:06.060- 17:09.220* :  this trip to China, which is a big thoring in relations.
*17:10.040- 17:13.720* :  And I had what can only be described as molten lava
*17:14.060- 17:17.080* :  that rolls up from your feet to the tip of your head
*17:17.560- 17:19.020* :  with needle spikes.
*17:19.700- 17:24.660* :  And you can't think, and I just could not get the words.
*17:25.740- 17:27.920* :  Xi Jinping out of my mouth.
*17:28.680- 17:31.860* :  And so I had to explain what was happening
*17:31.860- 17:34.980* :  or I would look bad at my job.
*17:35.340- 17:37.140* :  By saying it, some people, and I'm seeing this on the messages
*17:37.140- 17:39.080* :  were getting from some of our listeners this morning,
*17:39.080- 17:41.080* :  they also fear they'll look bad at their job.
*17:41.180- 17:42.980* :  It's kind of some people view it as a lose-lose.
*17:43.620- 17:46.020* :  I think for a lot of women, it is a catch-22.
*17:46.020- 17:51.080* :  And I think I was lucky enough to have
*17:51.760- 17:54.020* :  either a response of Lisa Miller,
*17:54.420- 17:57.000* :  who is one of the presenters on the program,
*17:57.200- 17:59.720* :  who immediately stepped in and said,
*17:59.920- 18:01.880* :  of course, we should be honest about this.
*18:02.580- 18:05.040* :  And Michael Roland, as well, was very supportive.
*18:05.760- 18:09.100* :  I think in that moment, you're kind of thinking in bullet points, right?
*18:09.280- 18:13.880* :  I was kind of thinking, how do I explain what's happening
*18:14.960- 18:16.080* :  without telling the truth?
*18:16.740- 18:17.980* :  I had to say something.
*18:18.440- 18:22.780* :  And so it was a very quick decision to kind of say,
*18:23.640- 18:25.820* :  well, no, this is the reality of what's happening.
*18:26.660- 18:29.540* :  And I can't say the word Xi Jinping right now.
*18:29.540- 18:33.080* :  And Lisa said, this should be normal.
*18:33.080- 18:36.000* :  Fifty percent, the population go through it
*18:36.000- 18:37.140* :  at some point in their lives.
*18:37.760- 18:38.700* :  How's the reaction be?
*18:38.860- 18:39.920* :  Genuinely lovely.
*18:39.920- 18:44.800* :  From all walks of life, very supportive.
*18:44.800- 18:46.640* :  I work at the University of Melbourne.
*18:47.300- 18:48.740* :  And I was in a meeting this morning
*18:48.800- 18:51.680* :  and one of my very senior male colleagues
*18:51.680- 18:54.200* :  at the end of the meeting said,
*18:54.200- 18:56.540* :  oh, I just want to talk about
*18:56.800- 18:58.520* :  imagines, appearance on the ABC.
*18:58.520- 19:01.520* :  It helped me raise a conversation with my wife
*19:01.820- 19:03.260* :  about her perimenopause.
*19:03.800- 19:05.580* :  And then that flowed on to a conversation
*19:05.580- 19:07.140* :  with our two teenage daughters.
*19:07.900- 19:10.080* :  I'd prefer it wasn't mine,
*19:10.080- 19:12.080* :  herimenopause they were talking about.
*19:12.080- 19:14.980* :  But I think if people are having
*19:14.980- 19:18.600* :  open and honest conversations about an issue
*19:19.420- 19:20.880* :  that everyone knows happens
*19:21.060- 19:22.920* :  but doesn't necessarily talk about,
*19:23.040- 19:24.360* :  then that's a good thing.
*19:25.480- 19:28.100* :  Imagine Crump speaking to Emma Barnett.
*19:30.540- 19:32.080* :  Still to calm on the Global News Podcast,
*19:32.080- 19:35.900* :  the pigeon which saved lives lost its seat.
*19:36.500- 19:37.760* :  She developed a nervous twitch
*19:37.800- 19:39.860* :  which was a result of the huge ordeal
*19:39.860- 19:40.760* :  that she'd been through.
*19:50.160- 19:52.040* :  A new study has shown that lightning
*19:52.040- 19:54.280* :  is the main cause of forest fires
*19:54.480- 19:55.420* :  in the northern hemisphere
*19:55.920- 19:58.500* :  and climate change will significantly increase
*19:58.500- 19:59.780* :  the number of strikes.
*20:00.280- 20:02.400* :  The researchers find that with each degree
*20:02.400- 20:03.820* :  the earth warms up,
*20:04.160- 20:06.540* :  they might have lightning increases by almost a third,
*20:06.920- 20:08.660* :  threatening to release carbon dioxide
*20:08.720- 20:10.880* :  stored in the trees into the atmosphere.
*20:11.380- 20:13.320* :  Here's our environment correspondent Matt McGraw.
*20:17.600- 20:20.080* :  Scientists now believe that lightning strikes like this one
*20:20.580- 20:23.060* :  are the major ignition source for forest fires
*20:23.540- 20:25.960* :  such as those that raged in Canada this summer.
*20:26.640- 20:29.940* :  Around 45 million acres of forest and land were burnt
*20:30.460- 20:33.780* :  six times the average area lost over the past ten years.
*20:34.540- 20:36.880* :  Smoke from these fires darken the skies
*20:36.880- 20:39.000* :  in distant cities across North America,
*20:39.640- 20:41.860* :  even drifting across the Atlantic to Europe.
*20:42.700- 20:45.080* :  This new study suggests that the vast majority of fires
*20:45.740- 20:47.060* :  such as those seen in Canada,
*20:47.060- 20:50.020* :  Russia and other areas in the north of the hemisphere
*20:50.760- 20:53.080* :  are not started by humans but by lightning.
*20:54.040- 20:55.100* :  They also found that a hotter planet
*20:55.100- 20:57.860* :  was likely to increase the frequency of lightning
*20:57.860- 20:58.680* :  in these regions.
*20:59.300- 21:01.040* :  Every degree of warming would see the number
*21:01.040- 21:03.920* :  of lightning strikes in these undisturbed forests
*21:04.420- 21:07.080* :  go up by between 11 and 31 percent.
*21:07.920- 21:10.700* :  Dr. Thomas Janssen from the Free University of Amsterdam
*21:11.200- 21:12.460* :  is the studies lead author.
*21:12.700- 21:13.940* :  With the warming climate,
*21:13.940- 21:17.620* :  we will have more lightning in boreal regions
*21:18.440- 21:21.580* :  so in Russia and in Canada and in combination
*21:21.580- 21:24.080* :  with a drying climate and warming climate,
*21:24.160- 21:26.980* :  there will also be more fires from these lightning strikes.
*21:27.260- 21:30.520* :  The researchers say that more lightning poses a significant problem
*21:30.960- 21:34.080* :  because these trees store vast quantities of carbon
*21:34.560- 21:36.080* :  as do the soils they grow in.
*21:36.720- 21:40.280* :  More fires from lightning will send more CO2 into the atmosphere
*21:40.980- 21:42.420* :  increasing the cycle of warming.
*21:42.940- 21:44.680* :  The authors say there is little that can be done
*21:45.000- 21:46.140* :  to avoid the increase.
*21:46.760- 21:48.520* :  The best hope lies in limiting warming
*21:49.060- 21:51.480* :  by rapidly curbing other sources of carbon.
*21:52.220- 21:52.760* :  Matt McGraw.
*21:53.500- 21:56.860* :  The government in Kenya has been accused of illegally evicting
*21:56.860- 22:00.060* :  indigenous people from their homes in the Maaforist,
*22:00.460- 22:02.020* :  the largest forest in the country.
*22:02.560- 22:05.100* :  The government says it's working to mitigate climate change
*22:05.100- 22:08.600* :  by driving out those who damage the forest illegally.
*22:09.480- 22:11.980* :  Lucy Claridge is director of the International Law
*22:11.980- 22:13.680* :  as Project Based in London.
*22:14.300- 22:17.000* :  She's represented the Oghietk people since 2010
*22:17.540- 22:19.420* :  and has been speaking to James Menendez.
*22:20.220- 22:21.940* :  The Oghietk are an indigenous community
*22:21.940- 22:24.860* :  who live in the Maaforist in Kenya's Rift Valley.
*22:25.000- 22:30.060* :  And in 2017, they won a case for the African Court of Human
*22:30.060- 22:32.740* :  and People's Rights against the government of Kenya,
*22:32.740- 22:36.060* :  declaring that they are the ancestral landowners,
*22:36.060- 22:38.920* :  the legal owners of their land in the Maaforist,
*22:38.920- 22:40.920* :  where they've lived since time immemorial.
*22:41.580- 22:44.000* :  And the land should have been returned to them,
*22:44.100- 22:47.460* :  pursuant to a further order of the African Court in 2022.
*22:47.940- 22:50.980* :  And effectively, the Cunning Government has taken no steps
*22:51.020- 22:53.940* :  to implement that ruling and is now taking steps
*22:53.940- 22:57.960* :  to directly contravenate by evicting the Oghietk
*22:57.960- 22:59.880* :  of a certain location in Narok.
*23:00.260- 23:04.040* :  The community have been wholly evicted from their homes.
*23:04.260- 23:06.860* :  Their homes have been destroyed and burnt.
*23:07.700- 23:09.480* :  Their school has been destroyed.
*23:09.480- 23:10.940* :  They have nowhere to go.
*23:11.240- 23:14.920* :  It's particularly cold in Kenya at the moment as well and rainy.
*23:15.340- 23:16.400* :  So they're effectively homeless.
*23:16.980- 23:19.520* :  The Cunning Government, they say it's in the name of
*23:19.920- 23:22.020* :  encroachment and illegal logging activities.
*23:22.080- 23:25.520* :  Is there any evidence that the Oghietk are cutting down
*23:26.080- 23:27.160* :  parts of the forest illegally?
*23:27.760- 23:29.280* :  There's no evidence that I've seen.
*23:29.280- 23:31.880* :  The Oghietk live in harmony with the forest.
*23:32.100- 23:32.920* :  They respect it.
*23:33.100- 23:35.000* :  They rely upon it for their livelihoods,
*23:35.100- 23:37.720* :  for their identity, their spirituality.
*23:38.380- 23:41.020* :  And in fact, this was an argument that the Cunning Government
*23:41.100- 23:44.940* :  ran before the African Court in 2017.
*23:45.800- 23:47.740* :  They argued that to conserve the forest,
*23:48.100- 23:49.600* :  the Oghietk needed to be evicted.
*23:50.200- 23:52.280* :  And the court in fact found that firstly,
*23:52.280- 23:55.080* :  there was no evidence of the Oghietk destroying the forest.
*23:55.360- 23:58.720* :  Secondly, that conservation did not justify the eviction
*23:58.720- 24:01.460* :  of the Oghietk from their homes in the rainforest.
*24:01.980- 24:05.760* :  There's been some suggestion that this is about carbon credits
*24:06.540- 24:10.060* :  offsetting, in other words, planting trees to make money,
*24:10.060- 24:13.280* :  I guess, from organisations that help companies and governments
*24:13.280- 24:14.860* :  offset their carbon emissions.
*24:15.460- 24:17.360* :  Is that what's going on? Is there anything to that?
*24:17.560- 24:20.180* :  The motivation is not quite clear at present.
*24:20.220- 24:24.000* :  However, it is being done for reasons of conservation,
*24:24.580- 24:26.480* :  which I use in a very loose term.
*24:26.960- 24:31.080* :  And the government has also indicated recently that it has funds
*24:31.280- 24:35.620* :  to conserve the forest, and it will be receiving funding to do so.
*24:36.080- 24:39.860* :  And therefore, there are concerns that systems of carbon offsetting
*24:39.860- 24:42.920* :  and carbon credits are having very negative implications
*24:43.080- 24:46.520* :  for the Oghietk, but also for other forest peoples in Kenya.
*24:47.040- 24:51.080* :  The cause conservation and carbon offsetting can often be used
*24:51.080- 24:53.160* :  to evict people from their homes.
*24:53.660- 24:56.320* :  I still think we don't fully understand the implications
*24:56.500- 25:00.940* :  of carbon offsetting and all of these apparent environmental frameworks
*25:00.940- 25:02.140* :  that are being put in place.
*25:02.480- 25:04.760* :  Finally, are there legal avenues that can be pursued
*25:04.760- 25:06.480* :  to prevent these evictions continuing?
*25:07.100- 25:10.060* :  Well, the Oghietk are already protected by two rulings
*25:10.060- 25:14.140* :  from the African court, which are legally binding on Kenya.
*25:14.140- 25:17.320* :  What I would ask is that the Kenyan government respects
*25:18.140- 25:21.860* :  the ruling from the African court and implements the ruling.
*25:22.240- 25:24.320* :  And I would say that if the Kenyan government would like
*25:24.320- 25:27.480* :  to conserve the mouth for us, then the Oghietk are the best people
*25:27.480- 25:28.060* :  to do that.
*25:29.040- 25:29.840* :  Lucy Clarwich.
*25:30.680- 25:33.500* :  China views the self-governed island of Taiwan
*25:33.500- 25:35.240* :  as part of its territory.
*25:35.720- 25:37.680* :  And since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
*25:38.100- 25:39.900* :  there's been growing into national concern
*25:39.900- 25:42.540* :  that Beijing could do the same to its neighbour.
*25:43.240- 25:45.960* :  China has increased military activity as seen Taiwan's
*25:46.000- 25:47.720* :  scale up its defence capabilities.
*25:48.420- 25:51.600* :  In September, it unveiled its first homemade submarine.
*25:52.080- 25:54.940* :  And from January next year, it'll extend the duration
*25:54.940- 25:59.300* :  of mandatory military service for all men from four months to a year.
*25:59.860- 26:03.540* :  Yolomagavan was given rare access to some of Taiwan's military facilities.
*26:05.240- 26:07.000* :  I'm here at Joye Air Base.
*26:07.160- 26:10.080* :  What you're hearing in the background there is a black hole helicopter
*26:10.080- 26:12.080* :  used for search and rescue missions.
*26:12.200- 26:15.800* :  But behind it is an F-16 Viper.
*26:16.020- 26:19.660* :  There's the first one that is taking all above this air base.
*26:23.420- 26:26.880* :  If there were to be a serious incident in Taiwanese airspace,
*26:27.380- 26:30.880* :  jets like the U.S. made F-16s may well be the first
*26:30.900- 26:32.560* :  to intercept that intrusion.
*26:33.240- 26:36.280* :  Major Chiang Yen-Ju, call sign drama,
*26:37.000- 26:38.880* :  is one of Taiwan's elite pilots.
*26:39.640- 26:44.800* :  With the communist aircraft harassing us really frequently,
*26:44.840- 26:48.060* :  we have to maintain our training and make ourselves prepared
*26:48.060- 26:51.080* :  and ready for any challenge that we may come up with.
*26:51.400- 26:55.080* :  I'm under a single aircraft hangar.
*26:55.080- 26:58.520* :  This is bomb proof, and actually you wouldn't really know it's here
*26:58.520- 27:01.240* :  if you were looking from the sky down.
*27:01.900- 27:04.080* :  And I've also got with me Colonel Lin.
*27:04.740- 27:08.900* :  He is the political warfare director of this unit
*27:09.500- 27:12.020* :  and has been with the Air Force for 26 years.
*27:12.180- 27:14.880* :  So what do you think is the biggest challenge
*27:14.880- 27:16.940* :  when it comes to being prepared?
*27:17.540- 27:23.080* :  Frankly, that will be demanding our every single pilot
*27:23.080- 27:26.460* :  to be as trained as possible.
*27:26.900- 27:30.760* :  You will find out the security situation is getting worse
*27:30.760- 27:33.280* :  if you're looking at a global picture.
*27:33.700- 27:36.700* :  What we do is to prepare ourselves the best we can.
*27:37.300- 27:42.960* :  mainland China is just 160 kilometers across the Taiwan Strait.
*27:43.460- 27:47.000* :  And one concern is what are described as grey zone activities
*27:47.000- 27:50.540* :  by China in or near Taiwan's coastal waters,
*27:51.000- 27:54.040* :  where it's alleged that fishing vessels are used by the authorities
*27:54.040- 27:56.620* :  in Beijing to keep an eye on Taiwan.
*27:57.320- 28:00.800* :  I went to the headquarters of the Coast Guard Administration in Taipei
*28:01.180- 28:03.040* :  to meet rear admiral Lin Chaolin.
*28:03.580- 28:05.600* :  He spent a long career in the Navy
*28:05.780- 28:08.920* :  and now he's been tasked with helping the Taiwanese Coast Guard
*28:09.340- 28:12.600* :  make that rapid transition from peacetime to wartime
*28:12.940- 28:14.120* :  should the moment arrive.
*28:14.760- 28:18.160* :  As you know, we cannot compare the numbers with China.
*28:18.480- 28:22.300* :  We have enough forces to protect our waters right now.
*28:22.800- 28:27.220* :  However, we need to have new ships to deter new threats.
*28:27.700- 28:30.740* :  I've seen some radar maps with you.
*28:31.260- 28:33.060* :  There are thousands of vessels.
*28:34.000- 28:38.520* :  How do you figure out what might be a potential aggressor?
*28:38.920- 28:41.720* :  Every day, PRC, China, fishing boat,
*28:41.900- 28:44.780* :  comes across our 24 nautical miles.
*28:45.540- 28:49.500* :  So, in recent years, we have detained many
*28:50.040- 28:51.240* :  these kinds of fishing boats.
*28:51.420- 28:57.640* :  Do you think in this coming year, Taiwan will remain at peace?
*28:58.940- 28:59.360* :  That depends.
*29:00.500- 29:04.800* :  For my personal views, I believe we have maybe three or four years.
*29:05.520- 29:06.520* :  Before any incident.
*29:06.680- 29:07.040* :  Yes.
*29:07.380- 29:08.260* :  With May non-China.
*29:08.800- 29:10.020* :  I believe so, yeah.
*29:10.740- 29:12.420* :  That report from Nulamagavan.
*29:13.240- 29:16.320* :  Metta, the company that owns the social media sites,
*29:16.320- 29:19.820* :  Facebook and Instagram, is cracking down on political adverts
*29:19.820- 29:23.620* :  on its platforms to counter misinformation and deep fake videos.
*29:24.260- 29:26.880* :  It follows an increasing concern that AI technology
*29:26.880- 29:29.840* :  could influence the result of elections around the world.
*29:29.840- 29:34.220* :  I got more from our technology reporter Imran Raman Jones.
*29:35.040- 29:37.000* :  What we're talking about here is deep fake.
*29:37.160- 29:40.080* :  So, that's when AI is used to change what someone says
*29:40.080- 29:41.560* :  or what they do in a video.
*29:42.280- 29:44.440* :  And the audio can be changed or even in a picture.
*29:44.980- 29:47.040* :  So, we saw the Pope in a puffer jacket
*29:47.040- 29:49.960* :  that picture was fooled a lot of people earlier this year.
*29:50.580- 29:55.520* :  It can also be used for other things like undermining election integrity
*29:55.520- 29:58.740* :  or in conflicts like in Russia and Ukraine.
*29:59.320- 30:01.180* :  And what is Metta planning to do?
*30:01.520- 30:06.200* :  What Metta is asking advertisers to do is when it comes to political adverts
*30:06.460- 30:09.180* :  and also adverts to do with social issues,
*30:09.880- 30:12.880* :  they're telling the advertisers they need to mark the adverts
*30:13.180- 30:17.320* :  and tell them when they've used digital manipulation in them.
*30:18.140- 30:21.760* :  And then that will show a marker to the user on the other end
*30:21.800- 30:24.960* :  that this adverts has been manipulated digitally.
*30:25.700- 30:29.720* :  I mean, it sounds as if they're going to depend a lot on those who are uploading.
*30:29.720- 30:34.460* :  So, arguably quite a lot of deep fakes and misinformation
*30:34.460- 30:35.820* :  might still get through.
*30:36.420- 30:38.160* :  Well, I did put this to them and they said
*30:38.700- 30:41.500* :  because they have their existing misinformation rules in place,
*30:42.060- 30:44.520* :  this is really about making it clearer.
*30:45.060- 30:48.340* :  Some people could say it's them being asked to mark their own homework
*30:48.340- 30:52.420* :  but Metta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram say
*30:52.420- 30:56.040* :  that they have moderation in place which is done by AI itself
*30:56.040- 30:59.840* :  and also by people to make sure that these don't get through.
*31:00.320- 31:03.860* :  There's been a lot of concern about this misinformation
*31:04.120- 31:05.380* :  and deep fake videos.
*31:05.960- 31:07.280* :  Has there been a tipping point?
*31:07.280- 31:09.680* :  Has there been one election, do you think,
*31:10.220- 31:13.480* :  when they have decided, Metta has decided something has to be done?
*31:14.020- 31:16.140* :  They've definitely been used in elections before,
*31:16.140- 31:19.940* :  not just on Metta platforms but on other online platforms.
*31:20.480- 31:25.160* :  So there were some examples in India a few years ago of deep fakes being used.
*31:25.520- 31:28.940* :  The worry is, I guess, there's a lot of elections coming up in 2024
*31:29.100- 31:33.060* :  and the technology is getting so good that they're really hard to spot now
*31:33.580- 31:36.940* :  so they will become more important in election campaigning.
*31:37.680- 31:39.040* :  Imran Rahman Jones.
*31:39.880- 31:42.840* :  A carrier pigeon called Winky has been honoured
*31:42.840- 31:47.660* :  after saving the lives of four people who's playing crashed into freezing waters
*31:48.100- 31:49.440* :  during the Second World War.
*31:49.680- 31:52.320* :  The pigeon managed to fly home and raised the alarm
*31:52.320- 31:56.360* :  and has now been honoured with a bronze statue in its Scottish hometown.
*31:57.740- 32:00.360* :  A Scotland correspondent, Lorna Gordon, takes up the story.
*32:01.360- 32:05.500* :  The badly damaged Beaufort bomber ditched in the freezing waters of the North Sea
*32:05.500- 32:07.860* :  after returning from a mission over Norway.
*32:08.500- 32:11.820* :  It was common practice at the time to carry pigeons on military aircraft
*32:11.820- 32:14.400* :  for last-minute emergency communications
*32:15.040- 32:17.260* :  and, unable to radio the plane's position,
*32:17.260- 32:20.820* :  the crew released two of them in the hope that at least one pigeon
*32:20.820- 32:22.720* :  would make it home to raise the alarm.
*32:23.520- 32:27.860* :  One never made it back, but the second called Winky was discovered exhausted
*32:27.860- 32:31.980* :  and covered in oil by its owner and broughty ferry who alerted the Air Force.
*32:32.580- 32:35.600* :  Nicholas Milton, who has written a book about the role birds played
*32:35.600- 32:38.800* :  in the First and Second World Wars, takes up the story.
*32:39.240- 32:42.400* :  Her owner calculated how far she had flown
*32:42.580- 32:44.340* :  and when the plane had gone down,
*32:44.340- 32:48.220* :  the RF hadn't been able to get an exact location for it.
*32:48.220- 32:50.280* :  Therefore, they were looking completely the wrong place.
*32:50.420- 32:55.640* :  Now, when Winky got back, they were able to calculate much more accurately the area.
*32:56.060- 33:00.880* :  The crew were rescued and the bird was celebrated for her 120-mile flight
*33:01.320- 33:02.440* :  in appalling conditions.
*33:03.120- 33:05.180* :  There was dinner held for Winky,
*33:05.700- 33:07.740* :  and she had prior to place at the dinner.
*33:07.980- 33:09.760* :  This was where she developed a nervous twitch,
*33:09.760- 33:12.780* :  which was a result of the huge ordeal that she'd been through.
*33:13.160- 33:15.360* :  And her eye was winking all the time,
*33:15.460- 33:17.660* :  and that's how she got her name.
*33:18.140- 33:21.420* :  The pigeon was retired from her role in serving the military.
*33:21.420- 33:26.280* :  Now a statue marking her bravery has been unveiled facing the Scottish waters
*33:26.780- 33:29.060* :  in which the Second World War crew might have died,
*33:29.100- 33:31.100* :  had Winky not made it home.
*33:31.620- 33:32.640* :  Lorna Gordon reporting.
*33:34.200- 33:35.100* :  And that's it from us for now,
*33:35.100- 33:38.300* :  but it will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
*33:38.760- 33:41.120* :  This edition was mixed by Alicia Thursting
*33:41.480- 33:42.920* :  and the producer was Emma Joseph.
*33:43.380- 33:45.060* :  The editor is Karen Martin.
*33:45.560- 33:47.520* :  I'm Valerie Sanderson and till next time, bye-bye.
*33:55.600- 33:58.880* :  Have you ever wondered what sets exceptional leaders apart?
*33:59.900- 34:02.440* :  Discover how renowned leaders from around the globe
*34:02.860- 34:04.620* :  have harnessed their natural talents
