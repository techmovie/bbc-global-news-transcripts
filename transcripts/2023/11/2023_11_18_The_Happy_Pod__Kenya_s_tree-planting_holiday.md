*00:56.260- 01:00.080* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*01:00.080- 01:06.940* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*01:06.940- 01:12.280* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*01:12.280- 01:18.460* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner. But controversially turned against the players
*01:18.980- 01:22.980* :  when his sneakers were off. So is he Good Bad or just another billionaire?

*01:53.140- 01:59.860* :  saplings and calls a public holiday to get everyone planting trees. Taking part, our correspondent
*01:59.860- 02:07.620* :  in Nairobi and Soy. I love fruit trees and I've tried to plant quite a variety of them at my home
*02:07.960- 02:12.200* :  apart from having tree cover, you also get to eat from that tree.
*02:16.940- 02:21.780* :  Also in the happy part, Geraldine who walked across Europe and then met the Pope.
*02:22.300- 02:30.540* :  I had cane nappers as I call it. Kidnapped with cane niffs. People were literally taking me in.
*02:31.100- 02:36.820* :  A possible cure for two rare blood disorders, a gene therapy drug approved for the first time.
*02:37.240- 02:43.840* :  The patients on the trials are absolutely thrilled because in more than 90 percent,
*02:43.840- 02:50.740* :  they no longer had pain crisis or needed transfusions. And I was in a state of displeasure,
*02:50.740- 02:55.500* :  I think that it actually happened. Turned to the ampah, I looked at him and he just shook his head,
*02:55.500- 03:01.820* :  looked at me and walked up and went, there's unbelievable. An extraordinary cricket over in Australia.
*03:01.820- 03:07.700* :  Hello, I'm Harry Bly and this is our weekly collection of positive and uplifting new stories.
*03:08.360- 03:10.700* :  The happy pod from the BBC World Service.
*03:17.180- 03:23.700* :  Let's begin with trees and lots of them. Kenya wants to grow 15 billion trees by 2033
*03:24.260- 03:28.280* :  and this week they took the first step with the government calling a public holiday
*03:28.760- 03:31.920* :  to allow Kenyans to plant tens of millions of saplings.
*03:37.160- 03:42.380* :  Our senior Africa correspondent Ansoy spoke to me from her home just outside Nairobi
*03:42.380- 03:48.480* :  about the special tree planting holiday. It took everyone by surprise. It has never happened
*03:48.480- 03:55.060* :  in this country and many people are skeptical initially. I was one of them. But on the day,
*03:55.340- 04:00.040* :  going to the sites where trees were being planted and watching the enthusiasm,
*04:01.180- 04:06.960* :  I actually realized that really people needed something like this. It was very ambitious,
*04:06.960- 04:12.420* :  a hundred million trees and in the mathematics the government had done. They said,
*04:12.420- 04:17.240* :  well, this is a nation of 55 million people. So even if five million don't take part,
*04:17.240- 04:22.020* :  if the other 50 million plant two trees each, then they'll hit that target.
*04:22.520- 04:29.000* :  What kind of trees are these saplings? These 150 million. Is it a range of different species?
*04:29.860- 04:36.180* :  That's right. The government had created an internet application called Jazamiti,
*04:36.180- 04:44.500* :  which is Swahili for the space with trees and this app was to provide people with information
*04:44.500- 04:50.000* :  about the trees that are appropriate for the places that they live in because we have people
*04:50.000- 04:56.300* :  who live in the high altitudes and the highlands, near mountains and in the Rift Valley.
*04:56.660- 05:01.500* :  And then we have people in the lowlands like coastal regions and therefore the climate is
*05:01.500- 05:06.200* :  different there. The advice had been given by government and also the seedlings that they were
*05:06.740- 05:13.160* :  providing were suited to every climatic condition. But lots and lots of people were also planting
*05:13.160- 05:20.440* :  fruit trees and that is actually what I prefered myself because apart from having tree cover,
*05:20.440- 05:27.400* :  you also get to eat from that tree. I'm sitting in my backyard and just behind me is an orange
*05:27.400- 05:32.780* :  tree. It has some fruits now that I'm waiting to ripen. There are two purple trees in front of me.
*05:33.440- 05:38.440* :  There's a lemon tree. There's a problematic mango tree problematic because it's been attacked
*05:38.440- 05:44.380* :  multiple times by beetles that are eating the fruits. So I love fruit trees and I've tried to plant
*05:44.460- 05:50.100* :  quite a variety of them at my home and that is what people are doing and there's a national drive
*05:50.100- 05:55.200* :  actually to get school children to plant fruit trees in their schools because it's good for
*05:55.200- 06:01.020* :  nutrition. So it's an eternally environmentally sound. It's good for the children's nutrition so
*06:01.020- 06:05.940* :  they can, you know, just pluck them whenever they need, whenever the fruits ripen. When I was growing
*06:05.940- 06:11.540* :  up in the 80s and 90s in primary school, I had a tree that I was looking after as did every child
*06:12.060- 06:16.360* :  in this country. So we have grown up with that tradition of planting and looking after trees.
*06:17.720- 06:21.720* :  It's such a wonderful idea and it's been received well by the public it sounds like.
*06:21.960- 06:27.500* :  Yeah, absolutely. A friend of a friend actually posted on social media saying that he had planted
*06:27.500- 06:34.580* :  300. He lives on a farm near Mount Kenya in central Kenya, you know, 300. That is way, way
*06:34.580- 06:40.840* :  beyond what the government had asked people to saw. I'm not surprised if they hit their target
*06:40.840- 06:46.700* :  or even surpassed it. Ansoy talking to me from her backyard just outside Nairobi.
*06:47.720- 06:52.900* :  Staying with improved air quality, a company in the US has opened the country's first commercial
*06:52.900- 06:59.800* :  facility that pulls carbon dioxide from the air. It uses calcium oxide made from heating limestone
*06:59.800- 07:06.860* :  which then absorbs CO2. This isn't a totally new concept. Another direct air capture facility
*07:06.860- 07:13.240* :  opened in Iceland two years ago, but this one claims it will remove 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide
*07:13.240- 07:18.600* :  per year. Already, Microsoft has signed a deal with air loom, the company that runs it,
*07:18.820- 07:25.520* :  to remove more than 300,000 tons of CO2 from the air. The facility in the state of California
*07:25.520- 07:32.500* :  consists of 12 meter high racks of trays of white calcium oxide powder. As Noah McQueen,
*07:32.500- 07:38.540* :  the co-founder of air loom explained. What we do is we heat them up. We take off their CO2
*07:39.100- 07:44.920* :  and they become very thirsty for more CO2. So these minerals naturally take up CO2 in nature.
*07:44.920- 07:50.260* :  What we do is we accelerate how fast they take up CO2 and put that into an engineered process.
*07:50.540- 07:56.580* :  So you have this calcium carbonate. We break it apart into calcium oxide, which is our sponge for
*07:56.580- 08:01.620* :  CO2 and permanently store that CO2 away from the atmosphere. You can think of this process like
*08:01.620- 08:06.120* :  laying out a sponge to take up CO2 and then bringing out the sponge and storing it away from the
*08:06.120- 08:12.120* :  atmosphere. Just two years ago, you captured your first grams of CO2 in a petri dish in a lab.
*08:12.800- 08:16.740* :  Now you've opened your first commercial plant. How has that process been?
*08:17.360- 08:23.820* :  It's been pretty exceptional. In 2020, we were capturing CO2 less than one kilogram of CO2
*08:23.820- 08:28.460* :  in petri dishes. And now we have the first commercial director capture facility in the United States.
*08:28.460- 08:32.900* :  And that facility can capture up to a thousand tons of CO2 from the atmosphere every year.
*08:33.540- 08:37.980* :  And for us, this is the pace that we need to iterate at, the pace that we need to scale at,
*08:37.980- 08:42.720* :  to really meet global climate goals. And whilst the expected impact that this could have,
*08:42.720- 08:47.080* :  I've read that it could reduce 200 cars worth of CO2.
*08:47.840- 08:53.160* :  Yeah, so this facility alone can produce up to a thousand tons of CO2 from the atmosphere,
*08:53.160- 08:59.840* :  but it's a first step. It's not the end game. The end game is removing billions of tons of CO2,
*08:59.840- 09:04.500* :  and AirLIM has the goal to remove a billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere by 2035.
*09:05.180- 09:09.880* :  What's next for AirLIM is to keep scaling. We went from that one kilogram to a thousand tons,
*09:09.880- 09:15.740* :  and we need to continue to build larger and more efficient plants.
*09:16.520- 09:24.220* :  Now a McQueen. Now let's hear from 54-year-old Geraldine McFall, who walked 3,200 kilometers
*09:24.220- 09:30.240* :  from her home in Glasgow to Rome. She spent six months trekking through the UK,
*09:30.240- 09:35.740* :  then through France, Switzerland, over the Alps, into Italy, and finally to Rome,
*09:35.740- 09:40.300* :  and to the Vatican, where she was honoured, with a surprise audience with the Pope.
*09:41.020- 09:46.800* :  I made the route up as I was going along. I did roughly plan out the route from Glasgow
*09:46.800- 09:54.340* :  to Scottish borders, over at Hoyk, just so that I knew for the first week or two I had a bit of a plan.
*09:55.100- 10:01.060* :  And then after that, each day, Google Maps was out working out roughly how far I could go,
*10:01.680- 10:09.540* :  where there were fewer hills and where I could stop the camp. I had a trailer which is actually
*10:09.540- 10:16.880* :  buggy for running parents, so I had this buggy strapped right my waist and pulling it from behind.
*10:16.880- 10:24.160* :  I packed too much when I left Glasgow, but in essence, I packed what I would normally have in
*10:24.160- 10:29.920* :  a rucksack. What were the best moments along the way? I imagine going through France,
*10:29.920- 10:33.360* :  going through Switzerland, you must have seen some extraordinary views.
*10:34.060- 10:40.020* :  The views and the scenery and the countryside all the way through the journey were incredible,
*10:40.020- 10:46.400* :  and yes, particularly Switzerland, but my big highlights really throughout the journey were the
*10:46.400- 10:53.600* :  people that I met, even just a hello, what are you doing, or a chat and a coffee, or staying with
*10:53.600- 11:02.480* :  people I had kidnappers, as I call it, kidnapped with kindness. People would literally take me in,
*11:02.820- 11:07.380* :  whether it would be allowed me to camp in the garden, or even more, take me in for the night,
*11:07.380- 11:12.100* :  let me have the spare room. The scenery was beautiful, but the people were even better.
*11:12.660- 11:18.380* :  When you reached the south of France and Switzerland, of course, and it an Italy, you hit the alps.
*11:18.380- 11:24.000* :  What was that like? That was a worry. I had no idea how I was going to get around the alps,
*11:24.000- 11:29.140* :  but I definitely wasn't going over them, and it wasn't until I had started the journey,
*11:29.140- 11:35.720* :  and people were saying you do realise there's no option but to go over the alps, and the alps were
*11:35.720- 11:42.540* :  beautiful, but I did have three days with no trailer to get myself over the alps. Tell me about
*11:42.780- 11:51.080* :  meeting the Pope and how that came about. Meeting the Pope was such an incredible surreal situation.
*11:51.240- 11:58.420* :  It came about unbeknown to me the Archbishop of Glasgow, William Nolan, had contacted the
*11:58.420- 12:04.920* :  Vatican household and asked if I could be presented to Pope Francis. I didn't know about any of this.
*12:04.920- 12:09.280* :  I knew that I had a ticket to the general audience, so I knew that I would be in the crowd,
*12:09.960- 12:14.700* :  but it was only when I collected the ticket on the Tuesday afternoon that I was told I would be
*12:14.700- 12:21.160* :  presented to Pope Francis. Even better than that, my 94-year-old godfather and his daughter,
*12:21.160- 12:26.800* :  they were permitted to come up with me, so they got to meet the Pope as well, and of course,
*12:26.800- 12:32.040* :  the tears were just flowing from the pain of us, but in Pope Francis, he was real drunk on his
*12:32.040- 12:38.680* :  wheelchair, and he had a beaming big smile when I met him in Shukhishand. It was just an
*12:38.680- 12:45.800* :  acceptable experience. Geraldine McFall and her long walk that raised more than $13,000 for
*12:45.800- 12:50.420* :  two charities supporting people with dementia and malnutrition in developing countries.
*12:51.520- 12:57.780* :  Next, a medical first, gene therapy that aims to cure two blood disorders, sickle cell disease
*12:57.780- 13:04.640* :  and beta thalassemia. Kazgevi uses a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR, a technology that won
*13:04.640- 13:10.740* :  the scientists who discovered it, the Nobel Prize in 2020. It's expected to be expensive,
*13:10.740- 13:17.260* :  but could offer a functional cure to these life-limiting conditions. I spoke to our medical editor,
*13:17.260- 13:26.140* :  Fergus Walsh. They're both inherited genetic blood disorders, so they're passed on by your parents,
*13:26.140- 13:34.300* :  and they're both caused by a faulty gene, and with both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia,
*13:34.300- 13:41.980* :  the red blood cells end up being misshapen, and they're both lifelong and life-limiting conditions.
*13:42.520- 13:49.920* :  And Fergus, this new drug uses gene-editing to try and cure these two conditions, so how exactly
*13:49.920- 14:00.320* :  does Kazgevi work? So, Kazgevi is the first drug using a gene-editing technique known as CRISPR,
*14:00.320- 14:05.260* :  which if I remember rightly, is an acronym that stands for clusters of regularly interspaced
*14:05.260- 14:13.800* :  short palindromic repeats. Now, it works by, effectively, what happens is you take the stem cells,
*14:13.820- 14:21.080* :  these are special cells found in the bone marrow, you take them to the laboratory, and then using
*14:21.740- 14:29.000* :  what we call molecular scissors, it's an enzyme called Kaz9. It runs down the whole DNA,
*14:29.000- 14:37.160* :  we've got three billion pairs of DNA in each of our nucleus, and it spins down it and finds the
*14:37.160- 14:43.080* :  exact point where the faulty gene is, and it makes a snip, that faulty gene stops working,
*14:43.700- 14:51.120* :  and a replacement gene starts working, and the patients start to produce healthy hemoglobin,
*14:51.120- 14:59.020* :  and have healthy blood. What does this drug look like? I'm guessing it's not just a simple pill that
*14:59.020- 15:06.240* :  you take. No, the drug is an infusion, and it's a personalized medicine created from a patient's
*15:06.360- 15:11.360* :  own cells. It looks a little bit like you're having a blood transfusion, but in fact,
*15:11.360- 15:17.840* :  your blood is going out, it's been spun round in a centrifuge to separate all the different parts,
*15:18.320- 15:26.300* :  and then this tiny number of bone marrow stem cells are collected, and then sent to a laboratory,
*15:26.300- 15:32.760* :  there's two in the world, there's one in the US and one in the UK, where they are then gene-edited
*15:33.260- 15:38.620* :  using this CRISPR technique, and then the drug itself, which is made from the patient's own
*15:38.620- 15:44.860* :  cells, is called castjebi. Like you mentioned, it's a lifelong condition, and there were trials
*15:44.860- 15:50.260* :  last year, which clearly have been successful, so what are patients saying? The patients on the trials
*15:50.260- 15:56.960* :  are absolutely thrilled, because in more than 90 percent, it's only a few dozen patients,
*15:56.960- 16:03.720* :  but in more than 90 percent of sickle cell and in Bethesda, LaSemia, that they no longer had
*16:03.720- 16:13.180* :  pain crisis or needed transfusions, and the hope is it is a one-off permanent fix. BBC Medical Editor
*16:19.020- 16:24.240* :  Fergus Walsh. Still to come. What was so special about this ice is that the lake bottom doesn't have any
*16:24.540- 16:29.940* :  vegetation, and it's rock instead of soil, and so the water is really clear.
*16:30.700- 16:36.640* :  Once in a decade, crystal clear ice, good enough to skate on. We're off to the US state of Alaska,

*17:23.760- 17:28.080* :  I'm Simon Jack, and I'm Zingsing, and this week on our podcast Good Bad Billionaire,
*17:28.320- 17:32.160* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*17:32.560- 17:37.960* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost a hundred million dollars
*17:38.300- 17:42.840* :  playing basketball. But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan
*17:42.840- 17:49.240* :  range is worth billions. And he made his real money as an NBA team owner, but controversially
*17:49.240- 17:55.060* :  turned against the players when Cisnik as well. So is he good bad or just another billionaire?
*17:55.320- 17:58.740* :  To find out, listen to Good Bad Billionaire wherever you get your podcasts.
*18:05.400- 18:10.740* :  What would you buy if you won the lottery? Some winners go big, a mansion, a supercar.
*18:11.220- 18:16.620* :  Neil Jones from the UK bought himself a new pool table. He was working as a Tyler,
*18:16.620- 18:23.740* :  and had just $16 to his name. But in 2010, Neil and his partner, Julie, won almost
*18:23.740- 18:29.680* :  $3 million in the UK's national lottery. And after a bit of practice on his new table,
*18:30.240- 18:35.300* :  Neil Jones is now captaining England at the European pool championships in Malta.
*18:35.420- 18:41.180* :  He's been talking to my colleague, Caroline Barker. More than happy to play for the county,
*18:41.180- 18:44.600* :  though, the county 18, because they have got a really good side. And then next thing with
*18:44.600- 18:49.060* :  COVID came, and there was an open trial for anybody who wanted to have for England. And I
*18:49.080- 18:52.620* :  managed to do really, really well at it. I just got in. That's when it became real.
*18:53.000- 18:55.860* :  Was it phone call? Was it face to face when someone says to you, had you fancy
*18:55.860- 19:00.980* :  captaining England for the European championships? I got told by my captain. He said to him,
*19:01.340- 19:04.780* :  he'll be getting a phone call off the England manager. You've got through him. So I said,
*19:04.780- 19:09.320* :  I can't believe this. So he messaged me. I was literally sobbing for three hours.
*19:09.700- 19:12.960* :  Honestly, not just tearing sobbing. I was just too emotional.
*19:13.460- 19:18.660* :  Well, I know you've had a lot of wins in your life now with the lottery being captained
*19:18.760- 19:23.860* :  for England, but I might have one that might top that all. We put a little note round to
*19:23.880- 19:27.260* :  everyone in the office to come up with suggested pool nicknames for you.
*19:29.100- 19:30.900* :  I don't know if you've got one. Have you already got one?
*19:31.340- 19:36.860* :  I have actually don't read in this wrong way. It's chopper because if a ball's just over the
*19:36.860- 19:41.220* :  pocket, I can cut it in so fine. And I've always been got into Corby chopper Jones.
*19:41.620- 19:46.240* :  I don't know that we can top that. I'll try. Are you ready?
*19:47.040- 19:49.920* :  Yeah, go on. So the obvious one is jackpot.
*19:50.440- 19:53.860* :  All right. Yeah. The pottery's potter. No. Okay.
*19:53.860- 19:56.440* :  And these aren't going. The terracotta potter. I like that.
*19:58.200- 20:01.540* :  Somebody's been really thinking about that. Oh, no. I know. We don't know. Of course,
*20:01.540- 20:05.680* :  we have too much time on our hands. What will mean more to you that that lottery?
*20:05.680- 20:10.180* :  Or are they hand in hand? I guess that lottery win or stepping out as England captain.
*20:10.600- 20:13.800* :  It's got to be on par because any sports you strive play for your country.
*20:14.080- 20:16.640* :  And you don't even think of that. If it happens, it happens.
*20:17.160- 20:19.720* :  When you think about how many people have tried and had trials over the years,
*20:19.720- 20:23.740* :  people have been playing hard. They've been 40 odd years and they've never had trials for England.
*20:23.740- 20:26.800* :  I've been playing them rules for three years and I've managed to get it.
*20:27.100- 20:30.860* :  Are you getting emotional again, Neil? Yeah, it gets to you because obviously, like,
*20:31.260- 20:34.720* :  when we walked out of Brittleington, it was all used to me. I didn't know anything.
*20:34.940- 20:40.000* :  There's massive arena like a theater type thing. And there's another tier of seating above you.
*20:40.340- 20:42.280* :  I think you're like, it's my father was above there.
*20:42.640- 20:45.800* :  He'd be absolutely buzzing because you walk out to rocking all over the world's theater square.
*20:45.800- 20:49.620* :  They say, please welcome the team England and you'll walk out.
*20:49.620- 20:53.020* :  There's about 60, 80 others. It's just overwhelming, really.
*20:53.020- 20:54.480* :  They just think that I wish me dad was here.
*20:55.280- 20:58.400* :  Pool table owner turned pool champion, Neil Jones.
*20:59.660- 21:04.720* :  Cricket fans love statistics. The records of run, scored and wickets taken.
*21:05.240- 21:07.140* :  The improbable and extraordinary.
*21:07.840- 21:12.140* :  So how about one over six balls taking six wickets?
*21:12.780- 21:17.020* :  It happened on Australia's gold coast in the Premier League Division three.
*21:17.680- 21:19.760* :  Nick Robinson spoke to the history maker,
*21:19.760- 21:24.760* :  Boller and team captain, Gareth Morgan, and began, of course, with congratulations.
*21:25.660- 21:26.980* :  Oh, thank you very, very much.
*21:27.520- 21:29.400* :  I'm playing for Mudra Barn or Rang.
*21:29.580- 21:34.620* :  Playing against surface paradise, they looked very comfortable for the entire innings and they were
*21:34.620- 21:41.180* :  four for 174, needing to get to 179 to win one over to go six balls.
*21:41.600- 21:45.120* :  It is your over and the umpire said something to you.
*21:45.800- 21:48.780* :  Yeah, so I took the ball, walk up to the umpire, gave him my hat.
*21:49.260- 21:53.120* :  He said to me, well, Skipper, you probably need a hat trick to win this one.
*21:53.580- 21:54.820* :  Is it a bit of a laugh at the time?
*21:55.220- 21:57.200* :  A hat trick. How likely did you think that was?
*21:59.220- 22:00.020* :  Extremely unlikely.
*22:00.720- 22:03.760* :  So take us through the over then because it was a lot more than a hat trick.
*22:04.460- 22:11.040* :  Yeah, so first of all then, I came into a guy who was in batting well, he's in the 60s,
*22:11.520- 22:15.440* :  put one down there for him hoping that I wouldn't tie him to punch it down the ground for a single,
*22:15.440- 22:19.480* :  but he hit it over as a deep midwicket where when the young fellas took a really good catch
*22:19.480- 22:20.160* :  on the boundary.
*22:20.500- 22:23.680* :  One ball down, one wicket, what about ball two?
*22:24.020- 22:27.780* :  Ball two, I decided to change from what I traditionally bow and
*22:28.100- 22:31.160* :  bowing off spin and thought, I'll actually try and bow a couple little cutters,
*22:31.680- 22:35.120* :  stuck a bit in the wicket, the batsman had to check his shot and he ended up
*22:35.320- 22:39.000* :  lofting the ball to a mid-on fielder in a regulation position.
*22:39.320- 22:41.480* :  Two balls, two wickets, what about ball number three?
*22:41.940- 22:46.840* :  Ball number three was very similar to ball two, except the batsman managed to turn it,
*22:47.040- 22:52.400* :  pop it up to a short midwicket who dive forward took a really good catch, a hat trick worthy catch.
*22:52.940- 22:54.260* :  Ball fall, tell us what happened.
*22:54.680- 22:57.880* :  Left-hander came out, confused the situation, had to move the field around.
*22:58.340- 23:03.400* :  I tried to sort of push it up onto off stump to contain him to again hit it down the ground
*23:03.400- 23:09.940* :  for a single and he took a bit of a swing at it and it flew out to point and another good catch
*23:09.940- 23:10.420* :  was taken.
*23:10.840- 23:16.260* :  Four balls, four wickets, ball number five, were you just in total disbelief at this stage?
*23:16.920- 23:20.340* :  A little bit, but I was also very focused on trying to
*23:20.860- 23:24.120* :  remind my team, one decent hit out of the middle of the bat,
*23:24.500- 23:29.380* :  it goes to the boundary and the game's over, so I decided they're going to have to try and hit
*23:29.380- 23:32.820* :  this because they now really don't have any options for singles.
*23:33.460- 23:39.220* :  So I just went at the stumps and hoped if he missed, I'd hit and that's what happened.
*23:40.140- 23:42.080* :  And final ball of the over, then what?
*23:42.520- 23:45.500* :  Before this one, I said to the team, well this ball's going to be the same as the last one,
*23:45.500- 23:47.500* :  I'm just going to go nice and full base at the stumps.
*23:47.960- 23:50.600* :  This is the first time I was confident where I thought maybe I might actually be able to pull
*23:50.600- 23:51.560* :  this off and get all six.
*23:52.140- 23:55.980* :  Good credit to him, he didn't just block it out and take the game, he tried to play a shot,
*23:56.460- 23:58.560* :  went through him, beat him and knocked the stumps over.
*23:58.760- 23:59.840* :  I've heard what happened.
*24:01.400- 24:06.060* :  Then there's a little bit chaotic, my team, I've more excited than me, I think I was in the state
*24:06.060- 24:08.160* :  of disbelief, I think that it actually happened.
*24:08.160- 24:13.380* :  Turned down by, I looked at him and he just shook his head, looked at me and walked up and went,
*24:13.960- 24:14.560* :  that's unbelievable.
*24:15.000- 24:19.180* :  Cricket Historymaker Gareth Morgan
*24:19.940- 24:26.980* :  Next to an ice window in Alaska, where the transition into winter has been unusually cold and dry,
*24:27.560- 24:33.320* :  allowing one of Alaska's alpine lakes to freeze in a way that's left the ice completely see
*24:33.320- 24:39.340* :  through. Luke Mel is an ice rescue instructor in the state, he and his wife were skating on
*24:39.340- 24:41.460* :  rabbit lake and shared their footage.
*24:46.520- 24:50.200* :  So usually these lakes are all covered with snow by the time the water freezes,
*24:50.960- 24:55.680* :  and I've been skating for about 12 years up here and this is, I've never seen it like that,
*24:55.680- 24:59.340* :  so this was a very unusual sort of unusual environmental conditions.
*24:59.340- 25:05.220* :  The combination of being able to look down three or four meters and see what's on the bottom,
*25:05.520- 25:09.060* :  I've never experienced that in the 12 years that I've been doing this.
*25:11.180- 25:15.520* :  I think what was so special about this ice is that because it's up in the alpine,
*25:15.520- 25:22.860* :  it's up in the mountains, the lake bottom doesn't have any vegetation and it's rock instead of soil,
*25:24.040- 25:25.820* :  and so the water is really clear.
*25:28.180- 25:30.360* :  Luke Mel skating on rabbit lake.
*25:31.780- 25:36.460* :  Ballet has been around for centuries. You mostly find it in major cities like Vienna,
*25:36.460- 25:43.460* :  Paris, Moscow and New York. Almost 45 years ago, a different kind of ballet opened. London City
*25:43.460- 25:49.300* :  Ballet was based in the capital, but its mission was to bring dance to new audiences who had little
*25:49.300- 25:56.680* :  to no access, touring smaller towns and cities in the UK and abroad. It closed in the late 1990s,
*25:56.940- 26:00.800* :  but next year it's reopening. Thanks to a former professional ballet dancer,
*26:00.800- 26:04.820* :  turned choreographer, turned artistic director Chris Marney.
*26:05.460- 26:10.220* :  I had no experience of dance before I went to see London City Ballet,
*26:10.580- 26:16.600* :  but there was something about it that captured my imagination because it's had that reach.
*26:17.240- 26:21.300* :  So many people have been affected by the work that they have seen it do.
*26:22.000- 26:23.620* :  It's a special thing to bring it back.
*26:26.740- 26:31.520* :  London City Ballet started life as a small dance company, putting on lunchtime performances
*26:31.520- 26:37.460* :  at the art theatre in London's Leicester Square. It was a popular lunch break activity among local
*26:37.460- 26:44.880* :  workers. Jane Sannig danced for the company for 12 years. We toured extensively here and abroad,
*26:44.940- 26:52.900* :  which was very exciting. I also got toured by a lot of wonderful teachers. Again, because the
*26:52.900- 27:00.020* :  company was small, we got great opportunity to dance. London City Ballet quickly expanded and
*27:00.020- 27:07.060* :  began touring Britain and beyond. Here's Chris again. It had amazing support from its audiences,
*27:07.060- 27:13.060* :  loyal audiences. The other element of support was, of course, Princess Diana, who was their
*27:13.060- 27:18.460* :  patron and really stayed by their side and supported the company. If you loved dance, but she believed
*27:18.460- 27:24.600* :  in the transformative powers of dance, in a sense, that there should be a company that is taking
*27:24.600- 27:31.160* :  dance to perhaps areas that don't always have the easiest access to live performance.
*27:31.840- 27:38.080* :  But 18 years later, in 1996, the company was forced to close, in part due to mounting debt.
*27:39.240- 27:44.480* :  In his mission to redirect the company, Chris has spent more than a year fundraising and rebuilding
*27:44.480- 27:50.880* :  London City Ballet. Next year, it will move into purpose-built studios at Sadler's Wells Theatre
*27:50.880- 27:56.180* :  in North London, where the original company was based. The first tour will include visits to many
*27:56.180- 28:01.400* :  of the old company's featured venues in the UK and around the world, including Italy, Portugal
*28:01.400- 28:06.760* :  and the United States. And it's not just the company itself, Christopher, is hoping to recover,
*28:07.400- 28:12.340* :  but lesser known and rarely performed works that he fears are at risk of being forgotten.
*28:12.800- 28:17.820* :  And one of those pieces, in particular, is by a great choreographer, Kenneth Macmillan,
*28:18.560- 28:23.560* :  and this work is entitled Ballard. It's a work for four dancers, it's a one-act ballet,
*28:24.280- 28:30.640* :  and it's one of those pieces that I feel should not be lost. It has too much of an history,
*28:31.300- 28:34.960* :  not to be seen, so it's sort of hidden gem of the repertoire.
*28:39.920- 28:45.700* :  Choreographer and artistic director Chris Marnie. And this, the music you can hear, is from the ballet
*28:45.700- 28:52.140* :  Chris referred to, Ballard in F-Sharp Major, Opus 19, composed by Gabrielle Foray.
*28:53.900- 28:58.700* :  And that brings this edition of The HappyPod to an end, but we'd love to hear from you.

*31:05.060- 31:08.880* :  we're finding out how Michael Jordan became the world's first athlete billionaire.
*31:08.880- 31:15.740* :  Considered the NBA's greatest player of all time, he earned almost $100 million playing basketball.
*31:15.740- 31:21.080* :  But that is nothing compared to what he earned off court. His air Jordan range is worth billions.
*31:21.080- 31:27.260* :  And he made his real money as an NBA team owner. But controversially turned against the players
*31:27.780- 31:31.780* :  when Cisnik as well. So is he good, bad, or just another billionaire?
