*04:05.760- 04:07.820* :  Outside the nearby Indonesia Hospital,
*04:08.260- 04:09.780* :  a long line of body bags,
*04:10.260- 04:12.320* :  some say the number of dead could be much higher.
*04:13.420- 04:15.040* :  Inside wards and corridors,

*04:31.220- 04:32.580* :  They were just in their homes.

*04:36.820- 04:38.500* :  Children, women, elderly.
*04:39.060- 04:40.580* :  We have no idea what to do.
*04:40.820- 04:42.140* :  There are injured everywhere.
*04:43.200- 04:44.600* :  This was a huge explosion,
*04:44.680- 04:48.220* :  a vast column of black smoke clearly visible from inside Israel
*04:48.220- 04:51.140* :  at about the time the first chaotic reports came in.
*04:51.720- 04:54.020* :  One weapons expert asked about the crater,
*04:54.440- 04:58.040* :  said it was consistent with the sorts of bombs the Israeli Air Force is using
*04:58.040- 05:00.580* :  to hit targets buried deep underground.
*05:00.580- 05:03.600* :  Israel said it had carried out a wide-scale strike
*05:03.600- 05:06.340* :  on what it called underground terror infrastructure
*05:06.980- 05:08.080* :  embedded beneath buildings.
*05:08.140- 05:10.780* :  It said the strike had killed a Hamas commander
*05:11.160- 05:12.480* :  and a large number of his men.
*05:14.680- 05:15.640* :  But Palestinian groups,
*05:15.640- 05:16.640* :  including Hamas,
*05:16.640- 05:18.660* :  are still firing rockets into Israel,
*05:19.160- 05:20.800* :  less than 20 miles from Gaza
*05:21.160- 05:22.760* :  in the coastal city of Ash Dodd,
*05:23.040- 05:25.420* :  four people were wounded in two separate attacks.
*05:26.260- 05:28.820* :  Paul Adams, as the war in Gaza has raised,
*05:28.820- 05:31.720* :  we've talked about the millions of Palestinians trapped there
*05:31.820- 05:33.660* :  who are under constant bombardment.
*05:34.320- 05:36.460* :  The Hamas' run health ministry says more than
*05:36.620- 05:39.420* :  eight and a half thousand people have been killed
*05:39.460- 05:40.820* :  in the past three and a half weeks.
*05:41.800- 05:43.980* :  This is a story of just one man,
*05:43.980- 05:48.560* :  Khalil Khadda, a father who lost all his children in an air strike,
*05:48.940- 05:52.420* :  as told to BBC journalist Mahmoud Basam in Gaza.
*05:53.140- 05:55.400* :  Foreign journalists are not allowed to enter Gaza,
*05:55.880- 05:58.940* :  so Fergil Keen has sent us this report from Jerusalem.
*05:59.840- 06:01.140* :  You may find it distressing.
*06:04.560- 06:06.240* :  Khalil Khadda walks alone.
*06:07.380- 06:09.380* :  The four children who might have played
*06:09.380- 06:12.460* :  and danced along the road beside him are dead.
*06:13.940- 06:16.940* :  Up ahead is the mound of rubble where his house once stood
*06:17.420- 06:20.260* :  and where 11 members of his family were killed
*06:20.780- 06:21.500* :  over a week ago.
*06:23.080- 06:25.740* :  The house is next to Al Najar hospital in Rafa,
*06:25.740- 06:27.240* :  where every day of this war,
*06:27.580- 06:29.940* :  the staff received the wounded and the dead.
*06:31.100- 06:32.840* :  And where Khalil Khadda was working,
*06:33.320- 06:35.300* :  the night his family became casualties.
*06:37.920- 06:39.940* :  A massive bomb exploded that night.
*06:39.940- 06:43.840* :  He tells us, standing on broken concrete and twisted metal.
*06:44.320- 06:46.740* :  And my neighbours started showing up at the hospital,
*06:47.660- 06:49.180* :  so I asked where was the bombing,
*06:49.780- 06:51.520* :  and they told me it was around my house.
*06:52.340- 06:54.760* :  I had to run to the house to check on the family.
*06:55.580- 06:57.700* :  I tried calling, but no one was answering.
*06:58.540- 07:01.440* :  And as you can see, the whole house was bombed.
*07:02.860- 07:06.440* :  Doug from the rubble, dead, his 70-year-old father,
*07:07.100- 07:10.060* :  his two sisters, his brother, his brother's wife,
*07:10.740- 07:13.200* :  their two daughters, and his four children.
*07:13.920- 07:16.400* :  He brought him nine years old, a mile five,
*07:16.920- 07:20.340* :  kinan, two and a half, and Rosa, 18 months.
*07:22.860- 07:26.280* :  As he walks, he picks out fragments of a life that no longer exists.
*07:27.360- 07:29.240* :  Some blue fabric catches his eye.
*07:30.300- 07:33.460* :  A pyjama said, baby Rosa wore in the days before the bombing.
*07:34.580- 07:39.440* :  He shows us a slow-motion video of Rosa in the blue pyjamas dancing with her cousins.
*07:40.220- 07:44.480* :  They sway gently, smiling through an afternoon from another time.
*07:48.000- 07:50.620* :  Another video, four cousins on a swing.
*07:50.660- 07:54.340* :  I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.
*07:54.880- 07:57.120* :  Calil had known war before in Gaza,
*07:57.120- 07:59.380* :  and worried about raising a family here.
*08:00.080- 08:04.820* :  Yet, Ibrahim, Amal, Kinan, and Rosa were born to a couple who dreamed
*08:04.820- 08:07.440* :  that their children would know a better life.
*08:11.100- 08:14.920* :  I remember in the 2014 war my wife was pregnant,
*08:16.160- 08:17.540* :  and our neighbors were bombed.
*08:18.360- 08:22.300* :  She was in her seventh month, and almost fell down the stairs from the blast,
*08:22.300- 08:27.120* :  and I thought to myself, how can I bring children into this life?
*08:28.520- 08:30.400* :  I had a dream for each of my kids.
*08:31.880- 08:36.360* :  Ibrahim was first in his school, and I dreamed of seeing him as a doctor one day.
*08:37.000- 08:38.700* :  Amal was very creative.
*08:39.500- 08:44.800* :  She loved drawing, and she used to show me her drawings, and sometimes I would draw with her.
*08:46.220- 08:49.560* :  Kinan was very playful, everyone loved him,
*08:50.940- 08:53.080* :  and he used to take care of his little sister.
*08:54.360- 09:00.360* :  He was always there to protect Rosa, and would say, don't touch her, she's my baby,
*09:01.960- 09:03.200* :  and now they are all gone.
*09:09.260- 09:10.780* :  That report by Furgle King.
*09:12.020- 09:16.240* :  The UN's Children's Agency, UNICEF, has warned that the constant bombardment
*09:16.240- 09:20.300* :  will cause Gaza's young population to suffer generational trauma.
*09:21.020- 09:22.900* :  James Elder is a UNICEF spokesperson.
*09:40.300- 09:44.000* :  3,450 children have been killed.
*09:44.720- 09:49.240* :  Staggeringly, this number rises significantly every single day.
*09:49.940- 09:52.920* :  Gaza has become a graveyard for children.
*09:53.280- 09:58.140* :  The Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, has strongly defended the military operations in Gaza,
*09:58.140- 10:02.220* :  insisting Israel is doing its best to limit civilian casualties.
*10:03.020- 10:08.580* :  He said it had to target Hamas' infrastructure, including homes, because the group was using them
*10:08.580- 10:13.420* :  to launch rockets. President Herzog was speaking to our chief international correspondent,
*10:13.420- 10:15.320* :  Lee Stusset, in Jerusalem.
*10:15.920- 10:21.260* :  As Israel intensifies its military operations in Gaza, the number of civilian deaths
*10:21.260- 10:27.160* :  keeps rising, including thousands of children. President Herzog said no one wanted innocent
*10:27.160- 10:32.520* :  garsens to pay a price, but he insisted that Israel had a right to defend itself.
*10:32.580- 10:35.260* :  Missiles fly on us to kill us.
*10:35.400- 10:38.380* :  What am I supposed to do by the right of first self-defense?
*10:38.380- 10:41.540* :  I have to eradicate the infrastructure that launches the missiles.
*10:41.840- 10:43.040* :  More than 8,000 dead.
*10:43.040- 10:47.820* :  And last night we heard nearly 70% of women and children.
*10:48.000- 10:50.520* :  Why have they had to pay the price?
*10:50.880- 10:55.400* :  Nobody wants them to pay the price. God forbid, my heart goes out truly.
*10:55.400- 11:01.220* :  But when you deal with the right of self-defense, what kind of self-defense do I have when people
*11:01.220- 11:03.280* :  went in to our territory?
*11:03.700- 11:09.040* :  Mr. Herzog said Israel was urging civilians to move to southern Gaza for their safety.
*11:09.660- 11:13.820* :  He rejected UN warnings that no part of Gaza was now safe.
*11:14.640- 11:17.200* :  The president kept returning to the same point.
*11:17.900- 11:21.740* :  That after Hamas' atrocities in southern Israel on October 7,
*11:21.740- 11:26.700* :  Israel, he said, was a different nation in unprecedented agony.
*11:27.480- 11:31.080* :  He dismissed warnings, even from Israel's closest allies,
*11:31.080- 11:36.420* :  that its military operations could create even more danger for Israel.
*11:36.920- 11:38.020* :  Please do set reporting.
*11:38.820- 11:43.080* :  Police in New York say they're questioning a person about anti-Semitic threats to Jewish
*11:43.080- 11:44.860* :  students at Cornell University.

*11:50.940- 11:54.800* :  The FBI is treating the incident as a potential hate crime.
*11:55.420- 11:56.520* :  Neutrophic reports.
*11:57.140- 12:01.520* :  No further information was released about the person of interest or the investigation
*12:01.520- 12:06.000* :  from either Cornell University, the police, or New York's governor, Kathy Hocal,
*12:06.000- 12:10.900* :  who on Monday visited students and assured them the state was taking the threats seriously.
*12:11.020- 12:15.660* :  In a statement, she said the individual was currently in custody for questioning

*12:44.360- 12:49.400* :  The group raised hands covered with red paint and shouted during the Senate hearing
*12:49.400- 12:53.100* :  as the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, made the case for more funds
*12:53.100- 12:55.060* :  to support Israel and Ukraine.
*12:55.580- 12:58.060* :  From Washington, here's our correspondent, Gary O'Donnor here.
*13:02.860- 13:07.640* :  Around two dozen protesters, their hands dorked in red paint, stood up during the hearing,
*13:07.640- 13:11.220* :  calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, before being dragged out.
*13:11.220- 13:16.000* :  Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, acknowledged what he called the passions in the room,
*13:16.360- 13:19.540* :  but said it was imperative for the U.S. to back its ally, Israel.
*13:20.080- 13:23.640* :  Mr. Blinken was also asked about humanitarian aid for Gaza,
*13:23.640- 13:30.000* :  and whether $9 billion designated for the conflict would all end up in the hands of people who
*13:30.000- 13:32.880* :  needed it, rather than being siphoned off by Hamas.
*13:33.140- 13:37.140* :  There will inevitably be some spillage we haven't seen it to date,
*13:37.140- 13:42.840* :  but I think we have to anticipate that, but the overwhelming majority of the assistance,
*13:43.340- 13:46.320* :  thus far, is getting to people who needed it, and we need more.
*13:46.660- 13:52.500* :  On top of the humanitarian aid, the administration is asking for $14 billion of extra security
*13:52.500- 13:56.580* :  funding for Tel Aviv, as well as $61 billion for Ukraine.
*13:56.620- 14:01.280* :  But some elements in the Republican Party opposed to more money for Ukraine
*14:01.280- 14:06.480* :  want the issues separated, setting up a congressional battle in the coming days.
*14:06.800- 14:07.720* :  Gary O'Donnor here.
*14:08.200- 14:09.080* :  Meanwhile, the U.S.
*14:09.080- 14:14.820* :  don't choose to say that another 66 aid trucks had entered Gaza over the last 24 hours,
*14:14.820- 14:20.660* :  the largest delivery in a single day so far since Israel imposed its siege on Gaza.
*14:21.180- 14:26.600* :  The White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said food, water, and medicine were
*14:26.600- 14:31.580* :  allowed through, but he said the needs remained huge, and more deliveries were planned.
*14:32.380- 14:37.560* :  It's the highest single day delivery so far, but again, it's a trickle compared to what needs
*14:37.560- 14:43.360* :  to get in, and we're going to keep working that very, very hard. Dozens of more trucks are expected
*14:43.360- 14:47.680* :  to clear, or obviously watching this as closely as we can, and we hope that they all get in.
*14:48.100- 14:52.460* :  The authorities in Egypt have said they will take in about 80 severely injured Palestinians
*14:52.460- 14:55.180* :  so they can be treated in Egyptian hospitals.
*14:56.140- 14:58.860* :  While international attention has been focused on Gaza,
*14:58.860- 15:03.380* :  concerns are growing about the other Palestinian territory, the occupied West Bank.
*15:03.380- 15:07.840* :  The Shin Bet Security Service has reported to have warned the Israeli government that violence
*15:07.840- 15:12.100* :  could erupt there, as clashes between settlers and Palestinians have increased.
*15:12.980- 15:17.400* :  The U.N.'s humanitarian office says violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank
*15:17.400- 15:25.060* :  has risen since the Hamas attack. It's recorded more than 170 attacks by settlers during that period.
*15:25.700- 15:32.060* :  The violence has led to the deaths of at least 120 Palestinians. One Israeli soldier has also
*15:32.060- 15:37.320* :  been killed. The U.S. has called in Israel to protect the Palestinians living in the West Bank
*15:37.320- 15:41.580* :  from militant settlers, as the White House spokesman John Kirby explained.
*15:42.500- 15:46.420* :  President has spoken to this himself, specifically talking about how dangerous it is that
*15:46.420- 15:50.500* :  extremists in the West Bank are killing innocent Palestinians, and it's got to stop,
*15:50.500- 15:53.960* :  it's deeply concerning. Each and every one of them is a tragedy too.
*15:54.880- 15:59.060* :  Roy Yellen is a spokesperson for Betzlem, an Israeli organization which monitors
*15:59.060- 16:03.680* :  human rights violations committed by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory.
*16:04.400- 16:08.540* :  Evan Davis asked him, what's been going on in the West Bank over the last three weeks?
*16:09.220- 16:13.480* :  Since October 7th, we are documenting an unprecedented
*16:13.480- 16:19.580* :  uptick in settler violence events in the West Bank. All over the West Bank, but particularly
*16:20.340- 16:28.580* :  in the most vulnerable, hurting communities, where this pressure is really helping Israel
*16:28.580- 16:34.240* :  achieve goal of forcibly displacing those communities from their homes and taking over their lands.
*16:34.900- 16:39.860* :  When you say you're documenting a rise in settler violence, can you give me an example
*16:40.580- 16:44.500* :  of what you mean, what we're talking about, what form this violence takes?
*16:45.240- 16:51.800* :  So anything that from threatening people, but from burying their access to their land,
*16:51.800- 16:58.320* :  to destruction of their property, cutting down their olive trees, or hurting their cattle,
*16:59.080- 17:04.040* :  including physical violence against those Palestinians. And we also documented incidents
*17:04.040- 17:10.300* :  in the past three weeks where Palestinian farmers were shot, shot to death by settlers.
*17:11.080- 17:16.040* :  Killed by settlers. Can I ask, is there a judicial process that would
*17:16.740- 17:21.760* :  bear out these reports? I mean, I've seen things on social media and one never knows quite what
*17:21.760- 17:27.380* :  to believe or what the full story was. What is happening in these cases? Because you are
*17:27.380- 17:33.220* :  presumably reporting them or they are reported. They are reported, but the Israeli policy,
*17:33.340- 17:39.240* :  for many years, for dozens of years, is actually to ignore and to provide settlers with
*17:39.500- 17:45.940* :  impunity from justice. This is why we are not looking at settler violence as something that is
*17:45.940- 17:52.000* :  coming from the ground, from the field, from below. It is actually sanctioned by the Israeli
*17:52.000- 17:57.660* :  government and it just serves as another means of taking over Palestinian land. In addition to
*17:57.660- 18:03.560* :  other, more formal means like bureaucratic means, restrictions on movement,
*18:03.560- 18:10.200* :  barring Palestinians from accessing very basic infrastructure like electricity and water,
*18:10.820- 18:14.900* :  not providing them with building permits, forcing them to build illegally and then the
*18:14.900- 18:20.960* :  mollishing their homes. In general, this policy is aimed in creating what is turned into
*18:20.960- 18:27.480* :  international law as a coercive environment. To what extent would the government accept the
*18:27.480- 18:31.840* :  narrative that you've just given me? Would they accept that they're not really trying to stop
*18:31.840- 18:37.400* :  settler violence against Palestinians? Or would they say that these are skirmishes that are
*18:37.400- 18:43.100* :  occurring with provocations on both sides and that they're not getting drawn? I'm trying to get
*18:43.100- 18:49.540* :  my head around what they would say to what you're telling me. This government, it would be like a
*18:49.540- 18:56.040* :  little bit too little too late with anything they might say because they have very public
*18:56.040- 19:02.160* :  expressions of support for this type of violence we had in the beginning on the very very first month
*19:02.160- 19:09.960* :  for this government being in office. The Minister of Finance said to wipe out an entire Palestinian
*19:09.960- 19:17.560* :  city, Khawara, in the context of a pogrom that no hundreds of settlers committed there. So this is
*19:17.560- 19:23.360* :  not, you know, thinking in a conspiratorial way, there are very very clear expressions of support
*19:23.360- 19:29.140* :  for this policy. What do ordinary Israelis, and I know that Israel is the Jewish communities of
*19:29.140- 19:35.160* :  Israel are not all one and they're not all identical in their thinking of course, but what do other
*19:35.160- 19:41.060* :  Israelis think of your group and what you're telling us right? Well, I think we're not
*19:41.060- 19:46.260* :  mispopular now because of course there's a lot of anger towards Palestinian in general in
*19:46.260- 19:53.220* :  Israeli society with just, or we're still actually experiencing atrocious war crimes committed
*19:53.220- 20:00.360* :  against us by Hamas and other groups of militant Palestinians from Gaza. The tender Israel
*20:00.360- 20:07.220* :  and committed the most horrible crimes and as a group that advocates for the rights of Palestinians
*20:07.220- 20:15.280* :  of course, we are not the most popular. That said, I think that most Israelis are definitely opposing
*20:15.280- 20:20.420* :  the settler violence and what goes on in the West Bank. They don't support it in any way.
*20:21.300- 20:27.240* :  Roy Yellen, a spokesman for Betzlem. Still to come on the podcast?

*22:13.340- 22:18.820* :  podcasts. Welcome back to the Global News Podcast. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has
*22:18.820- 22:24.600* :  warned the forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants, mostly Afghans,
*22:25.000- 22:29.560* :  could trigger a humanitarian crisis. It said the decision by the Pakistani government
*22:29.560- 22:35.180* :  amounted to forced repatriation. The Human Rights Commission said people needed a chance to
*22:35.180- 22:40.860* :  obtain legal papers. It ad urge the UN to persuade the government to extend the first of November
*22:40.860- 22:46.460* :  deadline for migrants to leave Pakistan voluntarily. Thousands of Afghans have rushed to the border
*22:46.460- 22:54.020* :  ahead of the cutoff date. An estimated 1.7 million people are facing expulsion. One migrant Sara,
*22:54.020- 22:58.600* :  not her real name, describes what might happen to her if she returns to Afghanistan.
*22:59.520- 23:06.400* :  If we go back to Afghanistan, we will be killed by Taliban or we will be present. There is not
*23:06.400- 23:13.940* :  any human rights agencies. There is not any UN agencies or there is not any united nation to
*23:13.940- 23:20.520* :  hear us. Today we made a protest and a slow vote, at least raise our voices. When I moved
*23:20.520- 23:27.100* :  here before my coming in Pakistan on December 2021, I thought they wanted to kidnap my 11-year-old
*23:27.100- 23:33.620* :  son. And this is somehow that this is a very difficult option, not just for me, even for my family,
*23:33.620- 23:38.480* :  for my kids, that if we go back there, the whole family life would be in danger.
*23:39.060- 23:44.680* :  Our South Asia regional editor, Ambrassan Etirajan, explained why after decades of hosting Afghan
*23:44.680- 23:51.040* :  refugees, the Pakistani government was doing this now. The relations between Pakistani government
*23:51.040- 23:56.400* :  and the Afghan Taliban have worsened in recent months after a series of attacks on Pakistani
*23:56.400- 24:02.680* :  security forces by Pakistani Taliban militants. Now, one of the reasons given by the government was
*24:02.820- 24:08.660* :  that they look at the number of suicide attacks in the country out of 24, according to the
*24:08.660- 24:15.620* :  Pakistani authorities, nearly 14 were involving Afghan nationals. So that was one of the reasons
*24:15.620- 24:22.140* :  why they were pointing out about why they have taken this decision asking all undocumented
*24:23.340- 24:28.060* :  migrants, not only Afghans, they say, but then most of them are Afghan nationals and it is
*24:28.060- 24:34.860* :  estimated to be about 1.7 million people. Yes, a huge number of Afghans because Pakistan has for
*24:34.860- 24:41.500* :  decades welcomed people fleeing from the wars in Afghanistan. So this is going to be a huge
*24:41.500- 24:46.900* :  operation taking these people back. Tens of thousands of people have sought refuge in Pakistan.
*24:47.400- 24:52.400* :  Many of them have married people in Pakistan. If set up business, some have their kids,
*24:52.400- 24:58.220* :  the born and brought up in Pakistan in the last 20 or 30 years, but many of them could not get
*24:58.220- 25:04.040* :  their documents. It takes time to get your documents. It doesn't happen overnight. It takes
*25:04.460- 25:09.580* :  months. Now the Pakistani authorities are insisting that they are focusing only on those
*25:09.580- 25:15.600* :  undocumented and this has created panic among many of these people. As we speak, thousands of
*25:15.600- 25:19.700* :  people are rushing to the border because the government has asked them to leave voluntarily
*25:19.700- 25:24.180* :  up to the 1st of November and then they say they would start the crackdown and many Afghan
*25:24.180- 25:29.360* :  agencies they say that already hundreds of people have been rounded up by police. So people are
*25:29.360- 25:34.320* :  trying to wind up their businesses and they are complaining because the situation in Afghanistan
*25:34.320- 25:39.060* :  is not conducive for a business and you're going to live under the Taliban administration.
*25:39.260- 25:44.280* :  So they are now caught in between the situation of where to go, where we are going from Pakistan to
*25:44.280- 25:48.320* :  Afghanistan. But many people are making this choice to go back to their country.
*25:48.600- 25:53.640* :  But a very difficult choice especially for women and for families with girls.
*25:54.200- 25:59.140* :  Yes, those who have been studying in Pakistan. So what kind of schools they're going to have
*25:59.140- 26:04.660* :  back in Afghanistan? As you know, the Taliban have banned most of the education for girls, especially
*26:04.660- 26:10.720* :  from secondary school onwards. So it is going to be a challenge one. Two women can work in Pakistan.
*26:10.720- 26:15.280* :  They can even do business. But when they go into Afghanistan, what kind of opportunities are there
*26:15.280- 26:20.440* :  because the Taliban have shot most of the job opportunities exerted for certain fields for women?
*26:20.940- 26:26.900* :  Ambrassan Etirajan. An official inquiry into the COVID pandemic in the UK has heard a claim that
*26:26.900- 26:32.800* :  the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson believed older people should accept their fate so the young
*26:32.800- 26:37.780* :  could boost the economy. The statement came from the diary of the former chief scientific advisor
*26:37.780- 26:42.820* :  Patrick Valens. Two of the former Prime Minister's top aides have also been giving evidence.
*26:42.820- 26:48.400* :  One of them, the former Downing Street Director of Communications, Lee Kane, said Mr. Johnson
*26:48.880- 26:53.200* :  didn't have the right abilities to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.
*26:53.200- 26:59.240* :  It was the wrong crisis for this Prime Minister's skillset, which is different, I think, from
*26:59.920- 27:04.660* :  not potentially being looked at the job of being Prime Minister. I think if you look at something
*27:04.660- 27:11.940* :  like COVID, you need quick decisions and you need people to hold the course and have that
*27:11.940- 27:16.220* :  strength of mind to do that over a sustained period of time. So I felt it was the wrong challenge
*27:16.220- 27:22.240* :  for him mostly. The former Prime Minister's chief advisor Dominic Cummings was asked why Mr. Johnson
*27:22.240- 27:27.160* :  hadn't been told of the growing crisis when he was on holiday in mid-February 2020,
*27:27.180- 27:33.100* :  a time when many other countries were realising and responding to the scale of the public health
*27:33.100- 27:41.100* :  emergency. I did not regard neither to other people. We did not think that asking the PM to come
*27:41.100- 27:46.620* :  back and talk to Cobra or Whitehall in general at that point would have been productive. In fact,
*27:46.620- 27:50.620* :  I thought it would have been counterproductive because I thought he would have said to everybody
*27:50.620- 27:55.300* :  what he thought at the time, which was, this is another swine flu, it's all another
*27:55.700- 27:59.780* :  rubbish media hoax, it'll work, nothing will happen, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The real danger
*27:59.780- 28:04.680* :  is the economy getting talked into a slump. Our political editor, Chris Mason, gave us this
*28:04.680- 28:09.980* :  analysis of the inquiry so far. The overriding impression of what we're seeing at the COVID
*28:09.980- 28:15.920* :  inquiry this week is one of dysfunction. Claims of a shambles at the heart of government
*28:15.920- 28:22.220* :  at just the moment government was more important to more people than it had been for decades and
*28:22.220- 28:29.520* :  decades. This inquiry matters because accountability matters. It matters so lessons can be learned
*28:29.520- 28:35.160* :  given the number of dead for a start. And it matters too for the reputations of a former
*28:35.160- 28:41.380* :  Prime Minister and the current one. Boris Johnson's character is being routinely and consistently
*28:41.380- 28:47.440* :  trashed by those who worked most closely with him. Mr. Johnson and his successor but one
*28:47.440- 28:54.160* :  Rishi Sunak will also give evidence. The dredging up of Mr. Sunak's decisions then still
*28:54.160- 28:58.560* :  with the capacity to contribute to his political fortunes now.
*28:59.480- 29:05.780* :  Chris Mason. King Charles has told an audience in Kenya that there's no excuse for the atrocities
*29:05.780- 29:10.920* :  committed by the British authorities during the colonial era. The King is on a state visit at
*29:10.920- 29:17.200* :  a time when the UK is keen to improve ties with Kenya. But the King did not formally apologise
*29:17.200- 29:24.660* :  for past abuses. A gesture many activists have demanded. An estimated 10,000 people were killed
*29:24.660- 29:31.060* :  during Kenya's fight for independence. From Nairobi our world correspondent Nicholas Wichel sent this
*29:31.060- 29:40.440* :  report. At the presidential palace in Nairobi a ceremonial welcome and 21 guns salute the King
*29:40.440- 29:45.440* :  Charles and Queen Camilla at the start of this state visit. The King then laid a wreath at the
*29:45.460- 29:51.420* :  tomb of the unknown warrior in Uhuru Gardens. It was here 70 years ago that the British authorities
*29:51.420- 29:57.000* :  set up a camp where they detained some of those involved in an uprising against colonial rule
*29:57.000- 30:03.100* :  known as the Mao-Mao rebellion. The uprising was led largely by members of the Kikuyu tribe,
*30:03.100- 30:07.940* :  many of whom had been displaced from their land. There were atrocities on both sides
*30:07.940- 30:13.500* :  but the uprising was crushed with great brutality. Mao-Mao suspects were tortured,
*30:13.500- 30:19.840* :  some were castrated, more than a thousand were executed. Tonight in Nairobi's state house,
*30:19.840- 30:25.220* :  the former seat of the British colonial governors, King Charles has addressed a state banquet
*30:25.220- 30:32.160* :  and acknowledged the pain felt by many Kenyans during the uprising. He spoke with feeling he expressed
*30:32.160- 30:39.220* :  sorrow and regret but stopped short of offering an apology. The wrongdoings of the past are a cause
*30:39.260- 30:46.580* :  of the greatest sorrow and the deepest regret. There were abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of
*30:46.580- 30:54.900* :  violence committed against Kenyans as they waged a painful struggle for independence and sovereignty
*30:55.820- 31:02.240* :  and for that there can be no excuse. As King Charles must reflect the British government's policy,
*31:02.680- 31:07.580* :  10 years ago it offered 20 million pounds in compensation for the handling of the Mao-Mao
*31:07.580- 31:13.260* :  uprising but there is a strong feeling that an apology cannot be made for actions for which the
*31:13.260- 31:17.900* :  present generation was not responsible. The palace will be herbing tonight's remarks will draw
*31:17.900- 31:23.480* :  a line under the matter. Both governments are keen to look to the future. Nicholas Wichel,
*31:24.280- 31:28.840* :  following in the footsteps of Qatar, it now looks as if Saudi Arabia will host the men's
*31:28.840- 31:35.820* :  football world cup in 2034 after Australia decided not to bid for the event. No other countries
*31:35.820- 31:40.100* :  had shown interest in staging the tournament ahead of the FIFA deadline on Tuesday.
*31:40.760- 31:45.260* :  Our sports editor, Dan Rowan, says there are conflicting views about whether Saudi Arabia,
*31:45.260- 31:50.380* :  which just a few years ago was being called a pariah, for its part in the gruesome murder of a
*31:50.380- 31:56.420* :  journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, is a suitable host. If you thought the winter world cup in Qatar was
*31:56.420- 32:01.400* :  a one-off, then think again. Less than a year since the Middle East staged football showpiece
*32:01.400- 32:07.360* :  event for the first time, it's emerged neighbouring Saudi Arabia. He set to play host in 2034.
*32:07.840- 32:12.140* :  Once again, extreme heat is likely to make the traditional summer slot impossible,
*32:12.140- 32:17.360* :  but anyhow, the manager of Saudi-owned Newcastle United has given the prospect his backing.
*32:17.720- 32:22.340* :  I think that our trips out there have been to two different places. Whatever we went,
*32:22.340- 32:27.340* :  it was really well organised and we were well looked after, so I think if that's a sign of what
*32:27.780- 32:31.680* :  a world cup might look like, then I think you can be rest assured that everything will be
*32:31.680- 32:36.660* :  structurally really good. With FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, known to be close to the Saudi
*32:36.660- 32:41.480* :  Crown Prince, the governing body appeared to pave the way for the Gulf Kingdom by limiting
*32:41.480- 32:47.920* :  possible bidders and fast-tracking the process. Saudi Arabia, just like Qatar, is facing criticism
*32:47.920- 32:52.060* :  over its human rights record. Steve Coburn is from Amnesty International.
*32:52.600- 32:56.800* :  Migrant workers are regularly exploited. Those are the migrant workers that would end up building
*32:56.800- 33:01.440* :  the stadiums and the other infrastructure. We know that anyone who criticises the regime
*33:01.440- 33:06.020* :  is imprisoned and we know that communities are discriminated against. So there are huge,
*33:06.020- 33:09.880* :  huge risks in doing this tournament. In recent years, the Saudi government has invested
*33:09.880- 33:14.940* :  billions of pounds into a range of sports, from football and to golf, to boxing and Formula
*33:14.940- 33:20.620* :  1, insisting the unprecedented spending is about modernising the kingdom, diversifying its economy
*33:20.620- 33:25.460* :  and inspiring its people. But with the world cup itself now on the horizon, the accusations
*33:25.460- 33:32.100* :  of sports washing will only intensify. Down-own. Here in Britain, the way you speak has traditionally
*33:32.100- 33:37.260* :  been seen as clear proof of your class and background. Now there's new evidence that the
*33:37.280- 33:42.880* :  Cockney accents spoken in working class parts of London and the plummy turns of the English
*33:42.880- 33:48.820* :  upper classes are in decline. Researchers analysed the voices of nearly 200 young people from
*33:48.820- 33:53.700* :  across Southeast England and London and grouped them together by how they pronounced vows.
*33:54.360- 33:58.920* :  Three new accent categories have emerged, which the researchers say are due to the increased
*33:58.920- 34:04.020* :  movement of people, the spread of universal education and a growing emphasis on a so-called
*34:04.020- 34:08.920* :  correct way of speaking. Our correspondence, Zoe Conway, has been taking a listen.
*34:09.300- 34:14.540* :  Researchers at the University of Essex found that the accent is dying out among young people
*34:14.540- 34:20.120* :  in the southeast. They've discovered that they no longer sound like Barbara Windsor.
*34:20.380- 34:23.060* :  You ain't going to get me again, we're not going to go for a second take, are we? I said I think
*34:23.060- 34:28.300* :  that one didn't work the first one. But nor do they speak posh, like the Queen's received,
*34:28.300- 34:35.040* :  pronunciation. My own family often gather around watch television as they are at this moment.
*34:35.040- 34:41.360* :  Instead, one of the researchers Amanda Cole says they identified three dominant new accents.
*34:41.520- 34:48.520* :  We recorded young people all aged between 18 and 33 and we then had a computer algorithm that we
*34:48.520- 34:53.860* :  developed that essentially like listened as much as you know computer can. The algorithm came up
*34:53.860- 34:59.600* :  with three different accents. One in four people they listened to spoke estuary English, a sort
*34:59.600- 35:04.880* :  of softer version of Cockney, which means they sound like the singer Adele. Oh my gosh, yeah,
*35:04.880- 35:08.920* :  I mean we weren't supposed to live there this long or like you know. While the upper classes
*35:09.540- 35:17.140* :  are increasingly talking in SSBE, standard southern British English, think Prince Harry.
*35:17.380- 35:23.140* :  Yes of course, highly competitive, but for those of people who are asking what was that all about,
*35:23.520- 35:29.960* :  Multicultural London English is the third most commonly heard accent in the study as spoken by
*35:29.960- 35:36.580* :  the rapper Stormzy. He literally found me and said I've made something for you like.
*35:37.040- 35:44.320* :  What the research seems to suggest is that the link between class and accent is weaker than ever.
*35:45.520- 35:49.320* :  Zoe Conway reporting on the rich variety of English accents.
*35:52.100- 35:56.180* :  And that's all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
