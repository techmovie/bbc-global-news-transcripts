*01:25.500- 01:30.940* :  I'm Janet Jalil and in the early hours of Saturday the 25th of November, these are our main stories.
*01:31.720- 01:37.160* :  24 hostages released by Hamass and Gaza are now back in Israel and are in the process of
*01:37.160- 01:44.960* :  being reunited with their families. The UN says 137 trucks delivered aid to Gaza on Friday by far
*01:44.960- 01:50.960* :  the greatest daily number since the conflict began. The fishing vessel has been seized by suspected
*01:50.960- 01:55.640* :  Somali pirates, a practice thought would have been virtually stamped out a decade ago.
*01:58.540- 02:01.740* :  Also in this podcast, you want to start a step out for me for a second?
*02:02.620- 02:06.900* :  Okay, it'll just be a second. I'll just go up here as far out of the way.
*02:07.720- 02:12.180* :  How what appeared to be a routine traffic stop turned into a marriage proposal.
*02:12.920- 02:19.220* :  And we hear how English football referees are turning to aviation to communicate more effectively.
*02:23.180- 02:28.360* :  It's the moment that Israelis had been praying and longing for in the past seven weeks.
*02:29.120- 02:31.840* :  Hamass's release of the first group of hostages.
*02:32.780- 02:37.020* :  Welcome to I-24 News. I'm Albert Lewitton of the I-24 News Desk Intellivief. You're looking at
*02:37.020- 02:44.720* :  live coverage of the release of 13 hostages. Israeli television showed images of the 24 hostages.
*02:44.720- 02:52.200* :  13 Israelis, 10 ties and one Filipino being transported in a convoy of red cross vehicles
*02:52.200- 02:58.040* :  through the Raffa crossing into Egypt. The now back in Israel as part of a deal in which fighting
*02:58.040- 03:05.220* :  has been paused for four days. Palestinian prisoners released an aid allowed into Gaza after weeks
*03:05.220- 03:11.580* :  of Israeli bombardment and siege. This followed the massacre of October the 7th when 1200 people
*03:11.580- 03:17.940* :  were killed by Hamass in Israel. More than 200 other hostages still remain in Gaza among them
*03:17.940- 03:22.440* :  guild dickmen's relatives. But for him, this was a much needed sign of hope.
*03:23.140- 03:29.620* :  I can't believe it's finally here. I haven't seen the pictures yet, but I know
*03:29.660- 03:38.740* :  family members of the kids work coming back home now. I feel as if part of my family came back.
*03:39.420- 03:45.740* :  Behind us there's there's a guy he's taking off the names of the kidnapped from the signs that
*03:45.840- 03:52.040* :  that are signed right here. It's just we're just I can't believe they're finally here.
*03:52.960- 03:57.420* :  Our Jerusalem correspondent Tom Baikman told us more about the release of the hostages whose ages
*03:57.420- 04:03.300* :  range from two years old to 85. There's been a couple of moments where we've caught a glimpse of
*04:03.300- 04:07.760* :  them. First of all when the Red Cross jeeps were passing through the Raffa crossing and we could
*04:07.760- 04:12.860* :  see clearly at least one child in the back of one of the jeeps and elderly woman who
*04:13.400- 04:18.500* :  waived as the jeeps passed some of the cameras there. There was then another moment where they
*04:18.500- 04:24.900* :  appeared to be close to an Egyptian medical facility or an Egyptian facility where several of
*04:24.900- 04:32.220* :  them were seen walking into that area and they looked the ones we saw they looked pretty well.
*04:32.400- 04:37.340* :  But what's happening now is that they've been taken out having crossed onto the Israeli side by
*04:37.340- 04:42.340* :  the Israeli military taken to an airbase in the south of the country where they're going to have
*04:42.340- 04:49.080* :  preliminary checks. They can make phone calls then to the family members and they'll then be taken
*04:49.080- 04:53.320* :  to a few different hospitals in Israel. And that's when they'll be reunited with their families.
*04:53.320- 04:58.320* :  They'll have those proper medical checks at that point. So expect over the next kind of 12 hours
*04:58.320- 05:02.900* :  or so we'll hear a fair bit more about the condition they're in. Yeah so some of them will be
*05:02.900- 05:07.480* :  reunited with their families but we're hearing that some of them don't know that family members
*05:07.480- 05:15.360* :  have died. Yeah I think that's going to be the case because obviously communications have been
*05:15.360- 05:19.380* :  extremely difficult we know throughout all of this and yes that's the sense that many of them
*05:19.540- 05:26.020* :  don't know about what happened to relatives. Remember the absolute chaos the brutality in which
*05:26.800- 05:32.200* :  this whole thing was sparked in October the 7th we also saw those images of the way people
*05:32.200- 05:39.320* :  were being held captive in the way they were brought into the Gaza Strip. And also you have families
*05:39.320- 05:44.940* :  and Thai families that are now effectively separate. Among the 13 released are three generations
*05:44.980- 05:52.120* :  of one family an elderly woman and then a mother and young daughter now the grandmother in
*05:52.120- 05:58.680* :  that family who's among those released her husband is still being held captive in Gaza. So these
*05:58.680- 06:03.800* :  have been sort of extraordinarily difficult moments and I expect we'll hear more stories like
*06:03.800- 06:10.300* :  that as we hear more the returnees that decide to speak out. We don't know if any of them will or
*06:10.300- 06:15.000* :  which ones will I expect we'll hear more of that kind of thing. And over the next three days we're
*06:15.000- 06:21.300* :  expecting to see more hostages released 15 or but there are hopes that perhaps that number could
*06:21.300- 06:27.880* :  increase further. Yes so 50 is over the course of this what what was agreed to be a four-day cease
*06:27.880- 06:34.160* :  fire but there is in the agreement what's been termed an option to extend for a further five days
*06:34.340- 06:42.920* :  and you would see in that period anywhere between 10 11 12 up to 13 hostages released again per day
*06:43.400- 06:50.540* :  and in return for each hostage that is released three Palestinian prisoners would be freed by
*06:51.060- 06:57.540* :  Israel. Now my understanding of this is that it would be a maximum of five days because the entire
*06:57.540- 07:02.400* :  scope of this agreement is around civilian women and children and it's thought that there are
*07:02.400- 07:09.420* :  around a hundred in that category held captive by Hamas in Gaza so after that point that takes
*07:09.420- 07:14.380* :  you to around a hundred people I mean if they got to a point where a hundred civilian women and
*07:14.380- 07:19.900* :  children were freed you would then be into other categories of captives that would include soldiers
*07:20.160- 07:25.380* :  and also the men being held now they are not part of the scope of this agreement and that's why
*07:25.380- 07:30.960* :  it's always been termed as a maximum sort of nine days and after that you've got both sides saying
*07:30.960- 07:38.020* :  the war will go on. Tom Bateman well as we've heard part of the deal was for 39 Palestinian
*07:38.020- 07:43.480* :  prisoners to be released from jails in Israel and the occupied West Bank in exchange for the hostages
*07:43.480- 07:51.300* :  being freed from Gaza. 24 women and 15 teenage boys most of whom were being held in pretrial
*07:51.300- 08:03.060* :  detention were released. Onlookers cheered as buses left off her prison in the West Bank. No
*08:03.060- 08:09.560* :  or day is a Palestinian political analyst and activist. She told the BBC more about the Palestinians
*08:09.560- 08:15.360* :  who've been released from this prison. They are women and children many of whom have been detained
*08:15.360- 08:21.800* :  without any charge. At least five of the children are what Israel calls administrative
*08:21.800- 08:29.660* :  detainees. These are kids who are held without charge or trial. Some of the women are we're serving
*08:29.660- 08:36.180* :  sentences but to explain to the audience Palestinians including children go you know are subjected
*08:36.180- 08:42.440* :  to military courts. So these are not ordinary courts that you would think of in London or
*08:42.860- 08:48.200* :  or any other western capital. These are military courts that don't adhere to the same due process
*08:50.240- 08:55.620* :  standards and that's why in the eyes of the Palestinian public these are not convicted people
*08:55.620- 09:01.580* :  that they weren't rightly convicted and many really view them as well as hostages. They're
*09:01.580- 09:07.540* :  released even those just 39 out of thousands is very well-companied for Palestinians.
*09:08.600- 09:13.340* :  Palestinian activists no or day while our correspondent in the West Bank city of Ramallah
*09:13.340- 09:19.680* :  Lucy Williamson watched as Palestinians there celebrated the release. Behind me the green flags
*09:19.680- 09:26.340* :  of Hamas and many people here who credit Hamas was securing this release saying we'd like it to
*09:26.340- 09:32.100* :  have happened without the hostages taken by Hamas but without those hostages Israel would never have
*09:32.100- 09:38.360* :  released these prisoners. To Israel the people being released here tonight have been arrested,
*09:38.360- 09:44.660* :  have been charged on security grounds but to the people here they're the victims of Israel's occupation.
*09:48.000- 09:52.680* :  There just been more tear gas fired by the Israeli forces towards the crowd here. They were
*09:52.680- 09:58.860* :  really crowded around the Red Cross car demanding to know where the Palestinian prisoners were.
*09:59.700- 10:05.040* :  There's a rising sense of frustration that's been building here for hours now and it's at the
*10:05.040- 10:11.640* :  point of boiling over. Lucy Williamson in Ramallah meanwhile the biggest humanitarian convoy to
*10:11.640- 10:16.580* :  enter Gaza since the conflict began passed through the Rafa crossing with Egypt.
*10:21.300- 10:29.540* :  The UN says 137 trucks carried urgently needed food, water, medicines and fuel into Gaza on Friday.
*10:30.160- 10:35.540* :  Similar quantities of aid are scheduled to follow over the next three days of the truce. More than
*10:35.540- 10:41.020* :  one and a half million people have been made homeless in Gaza according to the Hamas run health
*10:41.340- 10:46.780* :  ministry. It also said that around 15,000 people have been killed, a third of them children.
*10:47.600- 10:52.320* :  UN said it would be callous to go from a pause to killing children again.
*10:53.120- 10:58.520* :  Bushra Khalidi from the A Charity Oxfam agreed that the pause in the fighting needs to be longer
*10:58.520- 11:04.840* :  than four or five days. That's not enough trucks should be coming in and out of Gaza at all times
*11:05.600- 11:11.680* :  without a permanent ceasefire. We can't really deliver this amount of aid in four days. How are we
*11:11.680- 11:18.620* :  supposed to build homes and rebuild hospitals and allow women to have a safe place to deliver
*11:18.620- 11:25.640* :  their babies and where is the restoration of electricity and water which are absolutely essential
*11:26.040- 11:32.660* :  to meeting the needs of 2.2 million people, 2 million of which have been displaced and are
*11:32.660- 11:39.700* :  practically destitute. People are starving. People are dehydrated. Women are dying, giving birth,
*11:39.700- 11:47.520* :  babies are dying while being born. There is a 25 to 30% increase in premature babies being born
*11:47.520- 11:54.440* :  in Gaza. Shelters remain overcrowded and also indiscriminately targeted. The situation has not
*11:54.440- 12:01.320* :  essentially changed. So, you know, the trucks and the fuel is welcome. The pause is really about
*12:01.320- 12:06.820* :  not having compartments over their heads and allowing Gaza's to sleep for at least a night
*12:06.820- 12:11.740* :  properly. And I really hope they get a good night's sleep in the next four days because
*12:11.740- 12:17.140* :  Israel has been very clear that it imponds to continue its military operations in the South
*12:17.440- 12:23.300* :  and has been clear about potentially intensifying its military operations. So, I do hope that they're
*12:23.300- 12:29.300* :  able to rest and brace themselves for what's coming next week. Bushra Khalidi from Oxfam.
*12:30.000- 12:34.980* :  Demonstrations are expected across Italy this weekend after an Italian student was found murdered.
*12:35.560- 12:40.880* :  The body of Julia Chekateen, who was 22, was discovered nearly in northeastern Italy
*12:40.880- 12:46.500* :  a week after she went missing. Italian politicians have batched new measures to tackle violence
*12:46.500- 12:52.520* :  against women in a rare show of cross-party unity. More details from our Europe regional editor,
*12:57.200- 13:00.240* :  Pumos. Women on the streets of Milan demanding that their voices
*13:00.540- 13:08.720* :  are heard. The banners they carried made clear the source of their anger. Freedom from violence
*13:08.720- 13:15.280* :  demanded one we want to live. It's the murder of 22-year-old Julia Chekateen that's prompted a
*13:15.280- 13:20.920* :  wave of protests across Italy. The medical engineering student disappeared after going with her
*13:20.920- 13:26.700* :  boyfriend to buy a graduation outfit. CCTV footage then emerged which apparently showed him
*13:26.700- 13:32.600* :  beating her in a car park and her body was later found wrapped in plastic bags. He was arrested
*13:32.600- 13:37.960* :  in Germany and faces being extradited. But the killing has prompted claims that patriarchal
*13:37.960- 13:43.380* :  attitudes remain all too common in Italy, with abuse and violence against women and inevitable
*13:43.380- 13:50.020* :  consequence. Pumos. Somali piracy was once a huge problem on the high seas, but then it was
*13:50.020- 13:55.780* :  almost completely eradicated in an impressive example of international cooperation by the
*13:55.780- 14:01.420* :  world's navies and shipping owners. Now, though, it seems the threat may be rearing its head again.
*14:01.420- 14:07.280* :  Suspected Somali pirates have captured a Yemeni fishing vessel and it's mostly Iranian crew.
*14:07.280- 14:14.100* :  I heard more from our Africa regional editor, Will Ross. According to one of the co-owners of
*14:14.100- 14:23.880* :  this fishing vessel, which is called the al-merage one, it was taken by pirates who came from a
*14:23.880- 14:33.740* :  small port town in Somalia called Ale. That is a place that was very notorious back in the day,
*14:33.740- 14:41.360* :  sort of 2008 to 2011, when the piracy was really rife. That's where a lot of the pirate gangs
*14:41.360- 14:50.740* :  came from. But according to this co-owner, there are some 16 Iranian fishermen and a Somali
*14:50.740- 14:59.720* :  national on board. And he says the gang holding them are asking for a $400,000 ransom and they've
*14:59.720- 15:08.640* :  threatened to carry out other piracy attacks in the area off the Somali coast unless that ransom
*15:08.640- 15:17.000* :  is paid. But we haven't had anything official from the Somali authorities or from any of the
*15:17.540- 15:21.700* :  international organizations that help with the patrolling of that water.
*15:22.460- 15:29.360* :  As you said, this was once a very common problem, Somali piracy, but it had almost completely stopped.
*15:29.360- 15:36.260* :  This is a rare case now. Yeah, it is a fairly rare case. After the 2008, when the problem got
*15:36.260- 15:42.100* :  really bad, there was a lot of work down to try and make the ships safer. So in terms of setting
*15:42.100- 15:49.220* :  up sort of safe rooms inside the ships where people could lock themselves and not be held hostage.
*15:49.840- 15:55.420* :  But the main thing was the deployment of international warships and there's still an international
*15:55.420- 16:03.280* :  presence there now. The European Union has a naval operation off the Somali coast and it's just
*16:03.280- 16:07.480* :  been given a mandate to go through till the end of next year because there had been some suggestion
*16:07.520- 16:12.200* :  that perhaps they would pack up and leave because there were so few attacks.
*16:13.480- 16:18.860* :  Will Ross, now to the US, where what looked like a routine traffic stop by police officers in the
*16:18.860- 16:24.980* :  state of Wisconsin, turned out to be something completely different. Stephanie Tillerson takes up
*16:24.980- 16:30.300* :  the story. Troy Goldschmidt and his girlfriend, Mariah Pritchard, were on a short holiday in
*16:30.300- 16:36.500* :  Oclair in Wisconsin. They were driving down a quiet but windy street close to the river downtown
*16:36.500- 16:41.720* :  when this happened. Do you want to step out for me for a second? Okay, it'll just be a second.
*16:43.040- 16:49.500* :  We'll just go up here and sort of out of the way. So Troy did what he was told. Then Mariah was
*16:49.500- 16:53.900* :  approached. Hi, I'm Officer Anderson, how are you? Hi, I'm well, how are you? I'm good. Would you mind
*16:53.900- 17:00.920* :  just stepping out with me as well? Okay, so what you said, it's just kind of not a big deal,
*17:00.920- 17:04.940* :  we just have to make sure that his license comes back. Okay, I'm still going to make sure that
*17:04.940- 17:08.560* :  there's no need for me. A law-abiding citizen, Mariah, also did what she was told,
*17:08.560- 17:15.400* :  expecting the police were carrying out a routine traffic stop. Only to turn round and see Troy
*17:22.560- 17:28.900* :  down on one knee. Oclair Police Department helped Mr. Goldsmith arrange his proposal.
*17:29.980- 17:32.720* :  They said you never know what's going to happen on a traffic stop.
*17:36.320- 17:40.160* :  Stephanie Tilletson reporting on unusual police engagement.
*17:40.680- 17:49.820* :  Still to come on the Global News Podcast? During a series like Break Friday, we tend to buy a
*17:49.820- 17:55.520* :  monster that we do not use and that we will throw away. While the French government has been

*19:11.980- 19:17.380* :  Food is incredibly important in the world. It's about survival, culinary heritage, culture,
*19:17.380- 19:23.120* :  and tradition. Different relationships across the world. The food chain from the BBC World

*19:43.600- 19:49.140* :  News Podcast. King Charles is already among the wealthiest people in Britain, but it's emerged
*19:49.140- 19:54.220* :  the monarch has collected tens of millions of pounds from people who have died in the north
*19:54.220- 19:59.780* :  west of England. This is because of a centuries old scheme which means the assets of people without
*19:59.780- 20:05.840* :  a will or known next of kin goes to the king through his hereditary estate, the Duchy of Lancaster.
*20:06.460- 20:11.380* :  A similar scheme operates in Cornwall in southwest England through his son Prince William's estate.
*20:12.220- 20:16.740* :  Norman Baker is a former member of Parliament who wrote a book about how the royal family spends
*20:16.740- 20:22.540* :  public money. My colleague Nick Eardley has been speaking to him about the story reported by the
*20:22.540- 20:28.160* :  Guardian newspaper here in the UK. This scheme has been going for centuries. It's a feudal scheme
*20:28.160- 20:34.140* :  that really should have been abolished century to go. What happens if somebody dies without a will
*20:34.740- 20:40.880* :  in the Duchy of Lancaster? Then that money or their estate goes to King Charles.
*20:42.020- 20:45.900* :  And similarly if someone dies without a will in the Duchy of Cornwall area,
*20:46.620- 20:51.640* :  then their estate goes to the Prince of Wales. This is an extraordinary feudal arrangement that
*20:51.640- 20:56.000* :  should have been dealt with centuries ago. We're talking about quite a lot of money here aren't we
*20:56.000- 21:02.320* :  tens of millions of pounds? Well indeed we're talking about a huge geographical area
*21:03.060- 21:08.640* :  and also it doesn't just include individuals, it can include businesses, it can go bankrupt.
*21:09.660- 21:14.540* :  Now the reason the Guardian are reporting on this today is because they've seen documents
*21:15.380- 21:21.080* :  suggesting that that money is not all going to charity, that some of it is going to
*21:21.180- 21:29.140* :  renovate property which is then rented out for a profit. It is the problem, the principle of the
*21:29.140- 21:35.520* :  whole thing, or is it how the money is being used? Well the principle itself is absurd and should have
*21:35.520- 21:44.280* :  been dealt with centuries ago. But I mean what we saw in World War II was a Georgia sixth was benefiting
*21:44.300- 21:50.800* :  from soldiers dying who had been residents in the Duchy of Lancaster and their money was going
*21:50.800- 21:56.560* :  to him personally. After the Second World War the royals then said that they would change
*21:56.560- 22:02.440* :  arrangements and the money which accrued through the Duchy of Lancaster's curious intestinal
*22:02.440- 22:07.860* :  arrangements would be used to give to charities. Well you know that's what we believed in, I believe
*22:07.860- 22:13.660* :  as a royal author was actually happening. The Duchy of Lancaster have responded to this story and
*22:13.660- 22:18.800* :  said that the money King Charles has agreed should be used primarily to support local communities,
*22:18.800- 22:24.120* :  protect the sustainability and biodiversity of the land and preserve public and historic properties
*22:24.660- 22:30.180* :  across the Duchy of Lancaster states. They're essentially arguing that this is about keeping
*22:30.180- 22:35.720* :  important buildings for future generations. Yeah, King Charles's buildings which will
*22:36.100- 22:39.340* :  increase the value of those buildings and the rental value that can be derived from them,
*22:39.440- 22:43.920* :  going straight into King Charles's own properties and his own assets. So what should
*22:43.920- 22:48.820* :  you view on what should happen now? How should this be reformed or just scrapped completely?
*22:50.000- 22:53.940* :  Of course it should be scrapped. It's got no place in 21st century this sort of ludicrous
*22:53.940- 22:58.460* :  feudal arrangement. The royal family over the years have been very very keen to minimise
*22:58.860- 23:03.080* :  what they spend personally and to maximise your amount of money they get from the public purse.
*23:03.660- 23:10.280* :  7.9 million was the civil-list allocation in 2011. Last year the sovereign grant is replacement
*23:10.280- 23:15.660* :  gives an 86.3 million, a huge increase. They continue to be exempt from inheritance tax,
*23:15.660- 23:21.180* :  the Duchy of Lancaster, the Duchy of Cornwall Payne, no corporation tax or capital gains tax,
*23:21.180- 23:26.960* :  although the class themselves are private estates. Every way you look, they are seeking to gain
*23:26.960- 23:31.120* :  money from the public purse and Parliament through the Public Accounts Committee should
*23:31.120- 23:36.020* :  instigate a proper and thorough investigation of royal finances and royal wealth.
*23:37.340- 23:42.540* :  Norman Baker speaking to the BBC and the Duchy of Lancaster said that on accession to the throne
*23:42.540- 23:48.260* :  his majesty the King reaffirmed that money should not benefit the sovereign's private income
*23:48.260- 23:54.560* :  but should be used primarily to support local communities, protect land and preserve public
*23:54.560- 24:02.000* :  and historic buildings. A South Korean fan of true crime has been sentenced to life in prison
*24:02.000- 24:06.920* :  after she murdered a stranger and told police she did it out of curiosity.
*24:07.620- 24:13.200* :  Zhong Yu Jung was said to be obsessed with crime shows and novels and scored highly on psychopath
*24:13.200- 24:18.300* :  tests according to police. Asia Pacific editor Mickey Bristol told us more.
*24:18.740- 24:25.260* :  This is a crime carried out by a young woman 23 years old called Zhong Yu Zhong and she carried it
*24:25.260- 24:32.700* :  out in May. What she did was she stabbed to death, stabbed a dozens of times a teacher who she'd
*24:32.700- 24:40.580* :  contacted on an app, essentially what she'd done is she's posed as a mother looking for a shooter
*24:40.580- 24:47.420* :  an English tutor of her daughter contacted the victim and then when they'd agreed a time for
*24:47.420- 24:54.120* :  this supposed daughter to go around it was the killer who turned up went into the house and then
*24:54.460- 25:00.160* :  carried out a killing it really easy to crime which carried out early this year really shocked South
*25:00.160- 25:06.540* :  Korea. And she apparently did it just because she was curious because she was a fan of true crime
*25:06.540- 25:13.580* :  and wanted to see what it was like to be a criminal herself. Exactly that's why it's really
*25:14.480- 25:20.240* :  been such a a crime which has captured the imagination in South Korea as she said she'd become
*25:20.240- 25:26.980* :  obsessed with true crimes books TVs and and simply carried out this murder out of curiosity.
*25:27.600- 25:34.480* :  Of course there's a little bit more to the backstory the murderer herself had been a loner for
*25:34.480- 25:41.000* :  much of her life initially she actually denied she'd carried out the murder but there was a lot of
*25:41.440- 25:47.840* :  evidence to point to the fact that she'd done it CCTV evidence she'd actually gone back home after
*25:47.840- 25:55.440* :  carrying out the killing got a suitcase and taking it back to her victim's house cut up the body
*25:55.440- 26:01.420* :  and then disposed of it she was caught because the taxi driver drove her saw some sort of something
*26:01.420- 26:07.860* :  suspicious and called the police. So for a fan of true crime she seems to have been very careless
*26:07.860- 26:14.760* :  and she was also trying to plead for a more lenient sentence. Yes the first point you mentioned
*26:14.760- 26:20.160* :  there about being careless the police noticed that they believe that she just because she was so
*26:20.160- 26:25.220* :  obsessed with carrying out this crime she hadn't really thought it through properly she just
*26:25.900- 26:30.200* :  carried out the crime and hadn't really worked out what she was going to do afterwards and so she
*26:30.200- 26:36.100* :  left lots of evidence including keeping her victims identity card some body parts were found at her
*26:36.100- 26:40.320* :  home house she'd actually got a lot of blood on her when she carried out this murder so I had to
*26:40.340- 26:47.780* :  change into the victims close so really she hadn't thought this through and was caught she finally
*26:47.780- 26:52.180* :  admitted quite recently that she carried out the murder and apologized a few days ago.
*26:53.280- 26:58.680* :  Mickey Bristol the French government is urging shoppers to think twice before they spend money
*26:58.680- 27:04.380* :  on the black Friday weekend. It wants customers to consider the environmental impact of what they're
*27:04.380- 27:10.300* :  buying as well as their own finances. From Paris our correspondent Yusko Field sent this report.
*27:12.540- 27:18.780* :  In a clothes shop a customer is choosing between two cut price polo shirt which is better he asks
*27:18.780- 27:25.220* :  an assistant but the assistant has a badge to say he's a Dave Wanderer a D seller and what he says
*27:25.220- 27:31.720* :  is don't buy either the one you're wearing is perfectly fine if you don't spend you help your pocket
*27:31.720- 27:38.520* :  and the planet. The ads have been put out to coincide with so called black Friday an institution which
*27:38.520- 27:43.780* :  in just a few years has become a fixture here in France as elsewhere but if one part of President
*27:43.780- 27:50.280* :  Macron's government the green bit clearly frowns on the model of mass through a consumerism another
*27:50.280- 27:58.520* :  bit the economic bit feels differently. This was the economy minister Bruno Lamar calling the ads
*27:58.520- 28:02.940* :  ill-conceived because of the harm they would do to honest retailers.
*28:04.900- 28:09.840* :  What's wrong with the leaves today most shoppers said the government was right to urge people to
*28:09.840- 28:16.420* :  think twice before making a purchase. I think that especially in those times this is a good thing.
*28:16.660- 28:24.300* :  Kind of make me realize that during a series like a black Friday we tend to buy a monster that
*28:24.300- 28:29.920* :  we do not use and that we will throw away. Another initiative the French government also recently
*28:29.920- 28:35.600* :  launched a repair bonus under which you can get a small subsidy every time you get clothes
*28:35.600- 28:42.340* :  mended by a registered tailor little gestures like the ads and to mudge people towards new behavior.
*28:44.220- 28:50.160* :  Huskerfield referees are never short of advice it often takes the form of verbal abuse from the
*28:50.200- 28:56.380* :  stands but now they're taking tips from a far more gentile group of individuals. British Airways
*28:56.620- 29:01.360* :  pilots have been drafted in to teach the premier league's top officials how to communicate
*29:01.360- 29:08.180* :  clearly when reviewing decisions using video technology known as VAR. Our sports correspondent Andy
*29:08.180- 29:25.540* :  Swiss takes up the story. The voice of a British Airways pilot clear calm in control now contrast
*29:25.540- 29:37.400* :  that with this. A chaotic chat between the video officials during Spurs Game against Liverpool
*29:37.400- 29:49.540* :  which ended with a goal being wrongly ruled out. So to improve their communication skills
*29:49.540- 29:55.920* :  England's top referees sought the advice of two B.A. pilots about their language and about how
*29:55.920- 30:03.580* :  to deal with multiple voices in stressful situations. While VAR officials at times adopted an informal
*30:03.580- 30:10.020* :  tone the pilots spoke to them about the need for simplicity and clarity to avoid potential confusion.
*30:10.020- 30:15.580* :  It's not the first time referees have received guidance from the aviation industry last year they
*30:15.580- 30:22.560* :  had a presentation from air traffic control staff. So while VARs had a bumpy takeoff so far in England
*30:22.560- 30:30.720* :  it'll be hoping for less turbulent times ahead. Andy Swiss we return now to our top story the
*30:30.720- 30:36.280* :  release of 24 hostages who've been held by Hamas in Gaza for nearly seven weeks and a subsequent
*30:36.280- 30:42.480* :  freeing of 39 Palestinian women and teenagers from jails in Israel and the occupied West Bank.
*30:43.480- 30:50.060* :  However more than 200 hostages remain in Gaza although dozens more are expected to be released
*30:50.060- 30:56.140* :  in the coming days. Our senior international correspondent Ola Gehrin has been speaking to members
*30:56.140- 31:10.840* :  of one family who are unlikely to be reunited soon. In the shade of an olive tree in the heart
*31:10.840- 31:18.540* :  of Tel Aviv in what has become known as hostage plaza a group of women sit in a circle singing
*31:18.540- 31:28.020* :  and remembering. They are friends and relatives of 38-year-old Itai Sversky
*31:28.840- 31:37.300* :  taken by Hamas from a kibbutz near the Gaza border. They know he won't be home soon. For Itai's
*31:37.300- 31:46.000* :  cousin Naama Weinberg there are mixed emotions today. When I will see the those hostages back
*31:46.720- 31:55.120* :  here in Israel I will be very happy for their families and for them 12 or 13 hostages that will
*31:55.120- 32:05.780* :  be released today hopefully and 50 total in the next four days is less than a quarter. We can
*32:05.780- 32:13.780* :  think that it's ended by this. It's it must be only the beginning. She and other relatives we have
*32:13.780- 32:21.060* :  spoken to are worried that their loved ones are in danger while they remain in Gaza. We know that
*32:21.060- 32:31.700* :  every day might be the last one. Naama says and that's a very hard thought. Many Israelis feel
*32:31.700- 32:37.480* :  connected to the hostages. Their faces have been everywhere for the past six weeks.
*32:42.340- 32:46.360* :  So there is a sense of collective relief that some are coming home.
*32:47.380- 32:48.560* :  All are given reporting.
*32:51.600- 32:56.060* :  And that's all from us for now but there will be a new edition of the Global News Podcast later.
