*00:49.840- 00:53.520* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:56.160- 01:02.380* :  I'm Alex Ritson and in the early hours of Wednesday the 29th of November, these are our main
*01:02.380- 01:14.180* :  stories no longer deep inside the Indian Himalayas. All 41 construction workers trapped for more than
*01:14.180- 01:20.560* :  two weeks are safely rescued. As more prisoners and hostages are exchanged on the fifth day of a
*01:20.560- 01:26.580* :  truce, the top UN official says there's only one solution to the conflict between Israel and
*01:26.580- 01:32.760* :  Hamas. Violence and military solutions are not going to achieve the much-needed political solution
*01:32.900- 01:38.460* :  that actually leads to a peaceful future for both Israelis and Palestinians. There's no way out.
*01:39.000- 01:44.860* :  And Sierra Leone's government admits the unrest of recent days was an attempted military coup.
*01:45.100- 01:53.280* :  Also in this podcast, Finland closes its border with Russia claiming Moscow is attacking it
*01:53.280- 01:58.400* :  with asylum seekers. And when I started diving, I was always the only black person on the boat,
*01:58.560- 02:02.660* :  whether it's your witsuit not fitting, whether it's someone asking, are you going to dive with
*02:02.660- 02:06.100* :  all of that hair? My friends would also say, why do you do white people things?
*02:06.680- 02:14.020* :  We hear from South Africa's first female black dive instructor and one of the BBC's top 100 women.
*02:19.680- 02:26.220* :  There is joy in India where 41 construction workers have emerged from a collapsed tunnel in the Himalayas
*02:26.220- 02:37.980* :  after being trapped for 17 days. There were scenes of jubilation and celebration as the freed men,
*02:38.020- 02:43.780* :  low wage workers from some of the poorest parts of the country, were finally pulled alive through a
*02:43.780- 02:52.800* :  pipe. Chaudhary's son was one of those rescued. I am very happy. I am 55 and I have seen life,
*02:52.800- 03:00.060* :  but my son is very young and he has a long life. I want him to fight every storm in his long life.
*03:00.460- 03:05.420* :  The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has congratulated all the rescuers involved in the operation,
*03:05.420- 03:10.920* :  which has been beset with problems and multiple setbacks. Our South Asia correspondent,
*03:10.940- 03:14.280* :  Samira Hussein, was at the scene when the men were freed.
*03:14.720- 03:22.180* :  It was an incredible day that was 17 days in the making. We have been covering this story for the last
*03:22.180- 03:30.040* :  week and a half and there was such a palpable difference in terms of the mood here when we arrived
*03:30.220- 03:35.640* :  as we heard of the news that they had breached through the last bit of debris and that they were
*03:35.640- 03:42.720* :  going to be able to rescue those workers. The excitement was incredible. They were pulled out
*03:42.760- 03:49.500* :  from inside the tunnel on stretchers on wheels and then they were quickly checked out by doctors
*03:49.500- 03:55.800* :  and then they were whisked away in ambulances that were already parked inside the mouth of the tunnel
*03:55.840- 04:01.200* :  and everyone was taken to a nearby hospital where they are getting a full checkup by doctors.
*04:01.440- 04:06.140* :  So how did the rescue teams finally make the breakthrough because we have been covering this
*04:06.180- 04:10.660* :  story. The machinery just kept on breaking down or failing. It was looking really scary.
*04:10.660- 04:18.260* :  It was so a few days ago when the drilling machine finally broke down and they decided that they
*04:18.260- 04:23.480* :  were going to abandon it altogether because it was the focus of so many technical difficulties.
*04:23.480- 04:29.420* :  They broke it up into pieces and they pulled it out of the tunnel. Once they did, they saw that
*04:29.420- 04:36.100* :  they had about 8 to 10 meters of debris left to break through in order to reach those trapped men.
*04:36.460- 04:43.220* :  So what they did is they were installing a pipe that was 800 millimeters wide that they were
*04:43.220- 04:48.720* :  putting in through the debris to rescue the men. So what they did instead of trying to drill a
*04:48.720- 04:54.280* :  hole and then push it through, they just pushed the pipe through and then they would manually
*04:54.280- 04:59.880* :  remove the debris that would have fallen into the pipe until they finally breached the last
*04:59.880- 05:05.140* :  of the rubble and the rescuers were met with cheers and clapping from the men that were inside.
*05:05.400- 05:09.900* :  So what's going to happen to this tunnel now? That is a very good question. I think that there are
*05:09.900- 05:17.860* :  questions about what happens now and why were the safety precautions that were recommended not followed.
*05:17.860- 05:23.660* :  There should have been a safety tunnel built in concurrently with the tunnel or the roadway
*05:23.660- 05:28.780* :  that was being built. That was not done. And then there are questions about whether this area is
*05:28.780- 05:35.440* :  stable enough to withstand that kind of tunneling in order to create this roadway. We were speaking
*05:35.440- 05:40.180* :  to one man that was working on the rescue operation and he was saying that as they were tunneling
*05:40.180- 05:44.560* :  through, there was another rescue attempt happening from the top of the mountain. They were drilling
*05:44.560- 05:50.500* :  through and he would say that that was putting them at so much risk because the mountain was still
*05:50.500- 05:57.340* :  moving and the risk of a landslide was still so high. Samira Hussein, 10 more Israeli hostages and
*05:57.340- 06:03.140* :  two from Thailand are now back in Israel after being released by Hamas. Grounds of Welsh has
*06:03.140- 06:08.420* :  waited in the southern city of Offer Kim holding flags chanting and singing songs.
*06:16.040- 06:21.700* :  In return, Israel has freed another 30 Palestinian prisoners. The latest release came on the
*06:21.700- 06:28.580* :  fifth day of the truce between Israel and Hamas. As many as 170 people remain captive in Gaza,
*06:28.580- 06:35.000* :  including children, more than 50 days after their abduction on October the 7th. Our correspondent
*06:35.000- 06:41.760* :  in Jerusalem Paul Adams gave me an update. Well, we've seen a group of 10 Israelis who have
*06:41.760- 06:48.380* :  been released. We've seen them in the now familiar scenes as they arrive at the Egyptian side of
*06:48.380- 06:54.220* :  the Raffa crossing with waiting ambulances. We saw most of them getting out of the Red Cross
*06:54.220- 07:00.180* :  vehicles that they were a bit transported in. They all seemed to be walking and as far as one
*07:00.180- 07:05.580* :  could make out in reasonable physical shape. This was quite an elderly group. Four women
*07:05.580- 07:12.800* :  over the age of 70, including 84-year-old Ditsa Heyman and also several members of a single family,
*07:12.800- 07:18.980* :  the Limburg family, including the youngest of the group today, Mia Limburg, who's 17 years old,
*07:18.980- 07:23.940* :  who seemed to be carrying her pet dog, a shits who called Bella, which is a fairly remarkable detail.
*07:24.420- 07:32.720* :  Two further Thai workers were also released and also a meeting of intelligence chiefs in Qatar.
*07:32.720- 07:38.380* :  Yes, it seems as though the heads of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, the CIA director,
*07:38.380- 07:43.920* :  William Burns, and the head of Egyptian security were all in Doha. The focus of the negotiations
*07:43.920- 07:51.300* :  very much how to keep this release process going. Today is the first of two extra days that have
*07:51.300- 07:56.300* :  already been agreed between the various parties, but there is obviously a hope that we will see
*07:56.300- 08:03.100* :  another 48-hour extension beginning the day after tomorrow, and then there are discussions about
*08:03.100- 08:10.220* :  whether it can be extended beyond that. So clearly, the fact that we now have had five consecutive days
*08:10.220- 08:16.620* :  in which the Israelis and Hamas and the other Palestinian groups holding hostages in Gaza
*08:17.020- 08:23.660* :  have all been seen to uphold their side of the deal, does raise hopes that this deal could
*08:23.960- 08:27.700* :  continue, and we could see further groups of hostages released in the coming days.
*08:28.160- 08:34.800* :  Paul Adams in Jerusalem. The conflict between Israel and Gaza may have paused, but the fighting
*08:34.800- 08:40.500* :  has already led to huge suffering on both sides. The UN Human Rights Commissioner Volkha Turk
*08:40.500- 08:45.940* :  visited the region recently and didn't mince his words, accusing both sides of committing
*08:45.940- 08:52.160* :  war crimes. Our Geneva correspondent, Imogen Fokes, spoke to him on his return, and asked him
*08:52.160- 08:59.260* :  first why he had been so blunt. I was at the border to Gaza in Rafa. I met Palestinian children
*08:59.260- 09:05.700* :  who had injuries that I have rarely seen in my life. Spine injuries, some of them couldn't even talk
*09:05.700- 09:10.460* :  because they were in such deep trauma and shock. I also met families of the Israeli hostages,
*09:10.460- 09:16.900* :  and I saw their pain. I can see there is immense suffering out there, and that suffering is created
*09:17.340- 09:23.240* :  from humans to humans, and I also see that some of the suffering is not seen by the other side,
*09:23.240- 09:29.600* :  so it is really important that each and everyone understands that the suffering is happening
*09:29.600- 09:35.560* :  on all sides and that we must do something about it. An international law is the answer to it,
*09:35.820- 09:40.260* :  and when it comes to the blockade and now the siege, if you look at international law,
*09:40.260- 09:44.480* :  it's very clear. We should never collectively punish people when you are in this type of
*09:44.480- 09:48.500* :  situations, and that's what has happened. Of course, now humanitarian assistance comes in,
*09:48.700- 09:52.980* :  but it's still inadequate, and we need much more of it, and it should not have happened.
*09:53.060- 09:57.080* :  There should not have been this denial of humanitarian assistance at the start.
*09:57.360- 10:01.940* :  Israel didn't even invite you into Israel when you went to the Middle East. I mean,
*10:01.940- 10:05.880* :  the UN, it doesn't seem very popular, certainly with Israel at the moment.
*10:05.980- 10:10.320* :  Well, I still haven't given up. I was able to go to Egypt. I was able to go to the border.
*10:10.320- 10:15.840* :  I was able to go to Jordan. I have asked to go to Israel. I will keep asking for it, and I hope
*10:15.900- 10:20.480* :  they will see it in their interest that I come, and that also I can deploy a team to Israel.
*10:20.680- 10:25.480* :  And again, to Gaza and the West Bank, because we have only got national stuff there at the moment.
*10:25.860- 10:32.320* :  What would you like to happen immediately? This truth is due to come to an end.
*10:32.320- 10:37.580* :  There has been talk that the war will resume with all its ferocity when it finishes.
*10:38.000- 10:43.120* :  I hope very much that this pause brings back sense to people.
*10:43.460- 10:49.880* :  They realize that violence and military solutions are not going to achieve the much-needed political
*10:50.500- 10:55.100* :  solution that actually leads to a peaceful future for both Israelis and Palestinians.
*10:55.100- 11:01.240* :  There's no way out, and it requires negotiations. It requires those who have influence over
*11:01.240- 11:07.600* :  both Hamas and Israel to exercise that influence, and to bring them back to, frankly,
*11:07.600- 11:13.140* :  a negotiating table that brings an end to this violence, that actually makes sure that there is
*11:13.420- 11:18.040* :  an envisioned future for both. And of course, it will have to involve the Palestinian authorities
*11:18.040- 11:22.660* :  and the state of Palestine. That's absolutely clear. We don't need more violence, we don't need
*11:22.660- 11:27.840* :  more conflict, we actually need something that brings them all together and finds a solution to it.
*11:27.960- 11:32.460* :  If you want the violence to end, the occupation must end. I think we can never give up,
*11:32.620- 11:36.580* :  including not on what now appears to be the most intractable situation.
*11:36.920- 11:42.520* :  I do think that everyone knows that we cannot go back to before, so there needs to be a different
*11:42.520- 11:48.220* :  way of dealing with this situation. I also hope that what we have been for years
*11:48.940- 11:53.240* :  saying about the human rights impact of this situation in the occupied Palestinian territory
*11:53.240- 11:58.100* :  will finally be heard, and that's really the biggest message. Human rights have to be taken
*11:58.100- 12:03.280* :  much more seriously. They cannot just be relegated to an anodine discussion in the Human Rights
*12:03.280- 12:09.340* :  Council to really lead to action by member states, not just by us, because, frankly, my own
*12:09.340- 12:14.380* :  colleagues in Gaza Strip have been dying. I mean, the other colleagues were killed. I have
*12:14.380- 12:21.740* :  my own staff who are victims. Walker Turk speaking to Imogen folks. The host of this year's UN
*12:21.740- 12:27.980* :  Climate Talks COP28 is the United Arab Emirates where the summit starts on Thursday. Now,
*12:27.980- 12:34.820* :  a BBC Arabic investigation has revealed that the UAE's own oil industry is not as clean as it
*12:34.820- 12:39.700* :  claims to be. It's releasing air pollution that is likely to be damaging the health of its own
*12:39.700- 12:46.360* :  population living in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. And as Habat Bitar reports, it's not just the UAE
*12:46.360- 12:50.140* :  population that is suffering from this avoidable type of pollution.
*12:56.260- 13:00.060* :  The first time Jessam had an asthma attack, he was unable to breathe.
*13:00.060- 13:06.580* :  His five years old and lives in Kuwait. His father says he didn't go to preschool for an entire
*13:06.580- 13:15.360* :  year because of his condition. We don't realize that in Kuwait we have pollution and the problems
*13:15.360- 13:19.520* :  that will keep affecting health, lungs and children in the future.
*13:19.800- 13:25.080* :  The country has some of the worst air quality in the world. It's often blamed on sandstorms that
*13:25.080- 13:31.760* :  cover cities and turn the sky a thick, dusty orange. But recent studies tell a different story.
*13:32.180- 13:37.240* :  Dr. Barack Al Ahmad has been studying the impact of air pollution on people's health in the
*13:37.240- 13:44.440* :  Gulf region, especially in Kuwait. If you say that the air pollution in Kuwait is all from dust,
*13:44.500- 13:48.720* :  then you can throw your hands in the air and say there's nothing I can do about it. That is not
*13:48.720- 13:58.300* :  the case what we found out that only 40% comes from the desert. 42% comes from sources that
*13:58.300- 14:06.480* :  involve power plants and involve the oil industry. This is man-made air pollution that we can
*14:06.480- 14:15.000* :  regulate, we can reduce, we can in fact eliminate. This is the sound of gas flares, huge columns of
*14:15.000- 14:21.720* :  fire illuminating the sky, night and day, burning excess gas from oil production and releasing toxic
*14:21.720- 14:29.960* :  black smoke. It's a practice that is almost entirely avoidable and most countries have pledged to
*14:29.960- 14:37.080* :  end it. But the BBC has found that it's widespread across the Gulf. In Iraq the Romayla oil field
*14:37.080- 14:43.740* :  managed by BP and Petro-China is the biggest source of flaring in the world. BP and Petro-China
*14:43.740- 14:49.040* :  told the BBC they are working with the operator of this field to reduce its flaring and emissions.
*14:49.680- 14:56.220* :  In the United Arab Emirates some of its worst flares are hidden away from the public on rigs out at sea.
*14:56.580- 15:02.360* :  A BBC Arabic investigation has found that toxic air pollution from these oil and gas sites is
*15:02.360- 15:07.960* :  carried by winds across hundreds of kilometers, potentially impacting the health of millions of
*15:08.220- 15:14.040* :  people, including those living in Dubai, the home of this year's climate conference COP28.
*15:16.760- 15:25.880* :  The world needs maximum energy, minimum emissions. This is Dr Sultan Al-Jaber, this year's COP
*15:25.880- 15:31.660* :  president. He is also the chief executive of the UAE's oil giants, the Abu Dhabi National Oil
*15:31.660- 15:39.180* :  Company or Adnoch. I am very pleased to say that over 20 oil and gas companies have positively
*15:39.340- 15:45.940* :  answered the call to step up and eliminate routine flaring by 2030.
*15:46.440- 15:53.140* :  But BBC analysis shows the UAE has not reduced its gas flaring in a decade. And despite Adnoch's
*15:53.140- 15:58.840* :  policy of zero routine flaring, the company has actually increased levels in at least three
*15:58.840- 16:04.940* :  of shore oil and gas fields. Adnoch says that across all their operations they are focused on their
*16:04.940- 16:14.300* :  goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2030. Today is his first day in first grade, so I hope he will
*16:14.300- 16:20.380* :  be able to adapt to other kids. Back in Kuwait, Jess' parents have decided to send him back to school.
*16:20.920- 16:21.440* :  Are you happy?
*16:22.060- 16:22.320* :  Yeah.
*16:24.600- 16:30.040* :  I am so happy he will experience a new world, he will meet new kids, he will make friendships.
*16:30.880- 16:35.360* :  We will see how he deals with his asthma. I can only hope for the best.
*16:35.600- 16:40.760* :  For the first time ever, this year's climate conference will have a day focusing on health.
*16:41.380- 16:47.520* :  For people like Jess'em, what will or won't be decided there could have a life changing impact.
*16:48.080- 16:49.320* :  Heba Batar reporting.
*16:50.180- 16:56.440* :  Zandil Nu Loveu grew up in the South African township of Soweta nowhere near the ocean.
*16:56.760- 17:03.820* :  But at 35, Zandil is now South Africa's first black female dive instructor and founder of the Black
*17:03.820- 17:09.220* :  Mermaid Foundation, an organisation seeking to get children from vulnerable communities to
*17:09.220- 17:15.900* :  befriend the ocean and take care of its habitat. She's been named as one of the BBC's 100
*17:15.900- 17:22.680* :  women of 2023. But Zandil's connection to the water hasn't always been positive, so let's hear
*17:22.680- 17:23.480* :  more from her.
*17:26.960- 17:32.240* :  When I was growing up every single time there was a drowning with a bio river close to my grandmother's
*17:32.340- 17:36.640* :  or later on out at sea, it would be said that a snake took the child.
*17:37.700- 17:43.360* :  And so you grow up with this, stay away from all big bodies of water and it causes a fear inside
*17:43.360- 17:47.880* :  your body. And then externally as you grow up there's a narrative of how you know,
*17:48.160- 17:53.840* :  oh but black people don't swim, the narrative lives around us but very quickly it becomes internalised
*17:54.020- 17:56.160* :  and that just builds on the fear.
*17:58.400- 18:05.580* :  The first time I saw the ocean I was about 12 years old and then in 2016 I go on the snorkel trip.
*18:05.860- 18:10.520* :  As we went on to jump into the water I started freaking out. I'm drowning, I'm drowning it as
*18:10.520- 18:17.420* :  messy. In the moments that follow is a self to sell, calm down and as I look beneath the surface
*18:17.420- 18:22.860* :  of the water there was this light beneath it and those were the sun rays on the coral reef.
*18:25.960- 18:29.040* :  It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life.
*18:29.900- 18:30.340* :  Fan in love.
*18:32.920- 18:37.460* :  When I started diving I was always the only black person on the boat as a guest. Whether it's your
*18:37.460- 18:41.520* :  witsuit not fitting, whether it's someone asking are you going to dive with all of that hair
*18:41.520- 18:47.060* :  and you're just like what does it mean to remind me that I'm the outsider? My friends would also say
*18:47.060- 18:52.420* :  why do you do white people things? The ocean for me is such a hard place because it holds so much
*18:52.420- 18:57.760* :  history around black bodies. There were all of these racial tensions because in South Africa people
*18:57.760- 19:02.440* :  were jailed for being at the wrong beaches, never mind being dispossessed of the ocean facing homes.
*19:02.520- 19:07.800* :  There's the physical history that creates a disassociation as to who belongs in the water.
*19:10.560- 19:15.820* :  When I qualified as a freediving instructor in 2020 I knew one thing. I did not want to work
*19:15.820- 19:20.700* :  in a dive shop continuing the norm. I wanted to use the certificate to be able to bring change
*19:20.700- 19:26.080* :  in my community. So the ocean hub is a dream that I had sometime last year.
*19:31.220- 19:35.160* :  What would happen if we had this hub where the kids could come to, where we read together,
*19:35.160- 19:40.820* :  we learn together, but also maybe expand into drama because kids don't often speak about what
*19:40.820- 19:46.600* :  they're going through. The ocean hub for me is a place that is a safe space for the kids to dream.
*19:46.980- 19:53.080* :  That's an important way to expand worlds that can feel very tiny and very suffocating.
*19:53.080- 19:59.780* :  The idea that we need to protect and save our oceans cannot be done by a minimal part of the population.
*20:00.160- 20:05.580* :  That's been a very difficult world in trying to communicate climate change problems,
*20:05.580- 20:11.220* :  rising ocean levels. It's hard to have that discussion when it feels like this white ocean has
*20:11.220- 20:17.340* :  always been advocated by white people. So for me it says we need all hands on deck to ensure that
*20:17.560- 20:21.880* :  these little ones that are growing up become ocean guardians and their own right they are able to
*20:21.880- 20:31.400* :  advocate for the protection of our ocean. Zandil, new loveu, South Africa's first black female dive
*20:31.400- 20:40.640* :  instructor and one of the BBC's 100 women. Still to come on the global news podcast,
*20:40.860- 20:47.860* :  the crews on the med that turned out a bit like the alien movie. The ships dock there with a scalpel,
*20:48.120- 20:53.280* :  split my door open and squeeze out what looked like milk, but with tea leaves in and I'm going like
*20:53.480- 20:56.220* :  what's the little dots anyway well, their eggs.
*21:04.340- 21:09.360* :  After days of speculation the government in Sierra Leone has now acknowledged that there was
*21:09.360- 21:15.900* :  indeed an attempted coup on Sunday. 20 people including 13 military officers were killed
*21:15.900- 21:20.160* :  when armed men attacked military barracks and prisons in the capital free town.
*21:20.160- 21:25.160* :  The government says the attacks were planned and coordinated. The information minister
*21:25.540- 21:29.380* :  is Chernobyl. The state security and intelligence forces around the time in
*21:29.380- 21:36.080* :  now said in November 26 incidents na be a field attempted coup. The intention of den people
*21:36.080- 21:41.820* :  are na be for illegali, so that and over to the democratically elected governments.
*21:41.820- 21:46.260* :  There were further clashes with those suspected of plotting to overthrow the government.
*21:46.260- 21:52.300* :  One person was detained in a free town suburb on Tuesday. The government had at first been careful
*21:52.300- 21:58.300* :  not to label the uprising as a coup attempt. So why the change our West Africa correspondent
*21:58.300- 22:04.460* :  is my agents. Many people suspected, particularly in free town, that this was an attempted coup,
*22:04.480- 22:10.180* :  but the government said that what it wanted to do was speak to the 13 or so people they
*22:10.180- 22:14.380* :  have on the detention currently interrogate them, find out what their motivations were,
*22:14.580- 22:19.060* :  and only after they'd done that would they be able to say whether it was definitely an
*22:19.060- 22:24.200* :  attempted coup. But this comes as people in the neighborhood of Maritown this morning in
*22:24.620- 22:30.100* :  reported hearing some gunshots. The police said that it was part of an operation to apprehend
*22:30.100- 22:35.660* :  one of the people responsible. So they're still very much looking for some of the people that were
*22:35.660- 22:41.840* :  behind this attack on Sunday, as well as the 2000 or so prison inmates that were released during
*22:41.840- 22:46.980* :  the attack. There's a nighttime curfew that is now in place indefinitely. The authorities have
*22:46.980- 22:52.320* :  said from 9 p.m. till 6 a.m. They say that's because of the fact that there's still prisoners out
*22:52.320- 22:57.840* :  there. So life isn't quite back to normal for serolunians who are being reminded on a daily basis
*22:58.260- 23:01.500* :  of how close they came to having a military takeover happen on Sunday.
*23:01.700- 23:05.940* :  They've acknowledged it wasn't attempted coup, but why? What was the motivation here?
*23:06.180- 23:10.880* :  It's not really clear yet. I spoke to a few people in free time to try and get a sense of what
*23:10.880- 23:15.820* :  they think might be behind it, and several reasons were given. First of all, there was a really
*23:15.820- 23:21.020* :  tense post-election period. There were general elections in June, and those were contested by
*23:21.020- 23:25.520* :  the opposition. The opposition refused to go into Parliament for a few months, and it was only
*23:25.520- 23:30.060* :  resolved in October after some mediation by the African Union and other regional bodies.
*23:30.680- 23:35.540* :  The reality in serolun is that a lot of people rely on their connection, their party affiliation
*23:35.540- 23:41.520* :  for things like civil servant jobs, for access to certain benefits, and what some people have
*23:41.520- 23:45.880* :  told me in serolun is that even amongst the armed forces, promotions, things like deployments
*23:45.880- 23:51.600* :  to certain areas are dependent on what party or part of, so even the armed forces are invested
*23:51.600- 23:55.780* :  in the political process. That might have been a motivation for why some members of the armed
*23:55.780- 24:00.700* :  forces decided to do a military takeover. Then there's also the fact that these elections were
*24:00.700- 24:04.880* :  criticised by international observers. They said there was a lack of transparency, some instances
*24:04.880- 24:10.740* :  of intimidation and violence. Then the third reason that's been cited is that inflation is at
*24:10.740- 24:15.580* :  over 40 per cent in serolun. There's lots of unemployment, and lots of people blame the government
*24:15.580- 24:22.720* :  for how bad the economy is performing. My any Jones. Finland has now closed its entire land
*24:22.720- 24:27.480* :  border with Russia. It's accusing Moscow of trying to destabilise its neighbour by funneling
*24:27.480- 24:32.740* :  asylum seekers into Finland and comes as relations between the two countries are at a very low
*24:32.740- 24:38.860* :  point. Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Reinsford reports. This is the last of eight border
*24:38.860- 24:43.880* :  crossings with Russia that Finland will close, accusing its neighbour of channeling asylum seekers
*24:43.880- 24:49.080* :  its way deliberately in what the Finnish Prime Minister has called a hybrid attack on his country.
*24:49.100- 24:55.640* :  He's warned Russia it has to stop. In a normal month around 30 people request asylum in Finland.
*24:55.660- 25:02.900* :  This month 900 have arrived from countries including Afghanistan and Somalia. Finland joined NATO
*25:02.900- 25:07.860* :  earlier this year after Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine and it's thought this is part
*25:07.860- 25:13.640* :  of Moscow's response although Russia denies that. Officers from the EU's border agency
*25:13.640- 25:19.420* :  Frontex, are you infinite this week to help patrol its long eastern border much of which runs
*25:19.420- 25:26.240* :  through the forest? Sarah Reinsford. At a recent summit of African union leaders and heads of
*25:26.240- 25:32.400* :  government of the Caribbean community, Caracom leaders issued a draft proclamation which stated
*25:32.400- 25:38.260* :  that African and Caribbean countries would form a united front to persuade European nations to
*25:38.260- 25:43.920* :  pay for historic mass crimes relating to the slave trade. At the meeting in the Ghanaian
*25:43.920- 25:49.640* :  capital Accra, they said that they would explore litigation options and work with the UN to assess
*25:49.640- 25:56.040* :  whether acts of enslavement constituted serious violations of human rights. Carlos Lopez is an
*25:56.040- 26:02.480* :  African union high representative for partnerships with Europe and a former UN under Secretary-General
*26:02.840- 26:08.540* :  Krupa Paddy asked him how important it was to persuade European nations to pay for slavery
*26:08.540- 26:14.860* :  reparations. It's very significant because it comes in the aftermath of the Samoa agreement that
*26:14.860- 26:20.560* :  has been signed between the European Union and the African and Caribbean Pacific group of countries.
*26:20.860- 26:26.780* :  The discussions toward signing this agreement have been very difficult and most countries did not
*26:26.780- 26:32.080* :  really think that this agreement was going to bring anything substantial in their relations with
*26:32.080- 26:38.960* :  Europeans and 39 countries decided not to sign and we have to see from the 44-day sign which ones
*26:38.960- 26:45.140* :  are really going to ratify. Were they difficult because of the painful legacy of slavery or were
*26:45.140- 26:51.300* :  they difficult because individual nations are not necessarily on the same page about this matter?
*26:51.700- 26:58.100* :  It's a combination of colonial legacy that has been the subject of a lot of contestation on the
*26:58.140- 27:03.160* :  previous agreements between the European Union and this group of countries because it's about
*27:03.160- 27:11.060* :  trade on commodities and as we know the colonial legacy is very much one that went from slavery to
*27:11.060- 27:17.140* :  commodity producing for exports to the benefit of others not necessarily the countries that had
*27:17.140- 27:24.000* :  the natural resources. So after six decades of independence we are still in the same situation of
*27:24.000- 27:31.480* :  having most African and Caribbean countries either dependent on one or two commodities or dependent
*27:31.480- 27:37.960* :  on handouts and structural problems that have not been resolved. So if we trace back the historical
*27:37.960- 27:43.860* :  reasons why there has been no evolution is because the engagements with the European Union have
*27:43.860- 27:50.860* :  not been to the benefit of these countries from the time they were colonies all the way to today.
*27:51.180- 27:58.320* :  I wonder what you say to those who believe that it is important to move forward now from that
*27:58.320- 28:06.140* :  difficult legacy of slavery. I think it's very important that we have now entered a stage in the debate
*28:06.140- 28:13.100* :  where talking about diversity has become much more accepted and in certain countries even required
*28:13.100- 28:20.400* :  diversity aspects are entering the realm of politics but also of policy and I think this is very
*28:20.400- 28:26.920* :  welcome and creates the space for much more action on the part of those who have been affected and
*28:26.920- 28:32.740* :  that were stigmatized and felt that until now there to fight a battle that didn't had any space
*28:32.740- 28:38.540* :  politically to succeed and the fact that the Africans and the Caribbean countries are pulling
*28:38.540- 28:45.360* :  together in one direction is very significant. The Africans just got a victory at the UN that is
*28:45.360- 28:51.400* :  quite unique by having all the countries of the global south voting a resolution they proposed
*28:51.400- 28:57.040* :  on a centrality of tax to move out of the WCD which is basically the club of the rich countries
*28:57.040- 29:03.280* :  into the UN. These demonstrations of agency are becoming more common. You had the Africans that
*29:03.400- 29:09.840* :  have been accepted as members of the G20 as a union and it's very hard to see that it's not
*29:09.840- 29:15.760* :  just unity amongst Africans in the continent but unity of Africans in general including their
*29:15.760- 29:20.060* :  diaspora in the Caribbean. Carlos Lopez speaking to Creeper Paddy.
*29:21.420- 29:27.680* :  For most a cruise is a chance to see some of the world and put your feet up. One man did
*29:27.680- 29:33.800* :  precisely this in Marseille in the south of France where a spider thought his toe might be the perfect
*29:33.800- 29:40.840* :  place to lay its eggs. Here's Terry Egan. If Colin Blake and his wife thought a cruise to Marseille
*29:40.840- 29:46.520* :  would be the perfect holiday to celebrate their 35th wedding anniversary what they probably didn't
*29:46.520- 29:53.940* :  know was that's exactly where wolf spiders often sell to arriving in the port on cargo ships.
*29:54.780- 30:00.480* :  So when Colin noticed his toe turning purple and swelling up he thought it might just be because
*30:00.480- 30:07.380* :  of his new sandals. The day after though he visited the on board doctor who told him he'd been
*30:07.380- 30:13.180* :  bitten. It was really born purple, yellow or kinds of colors and the ship's doctor with a scalpel
*30:13.180- 30:18.200* :  split my toe and then squeeze out what looked like milk but with tea leaves in and I'm going like
*30:18.200- 30:23.460* :  what what's the little daughter said their eggs but don't worry I've got them all. Except that he
*30:23.460- 30:29.340* :  hadn't. Back in England from where Colin had started his journey doctors discovered that one of
*30:29.340- 30:37.160* :  the eggs had hatched after all. For weeks a spider had been eating its way through his toe and now
*30:37.160- 30:44.080* :  had to be popped out. Colin will probably think twice about where he chooses to put his feet up
*30:44.080- 30:50.580* :  next time round. It's the biggest selling series of compilation albums in the world and has
*30:50.580- 30:57.440* :  inspired copycat efforts in the Netherlands, Spain, Japan and the United States. And on Tuesday
*30:57.440- 31:03.800* :  now that's what I call music marked 40 years since it was first released in the UK. The albums
*31:03.800- 31:10.600* :  which compiled the latest pop hits have sold more than 120 million copies and documented four
*31:10.600- 31:17.040* :  decades of musical trends. Music correspondent Mark Savage takes a look back at the series.
*31:19.200- 31:24.820* :  Phil Collins you can't hurry love was track one side one on the first ever. No that's what I
*31:24.820- 31:32.020* :  call music album. Since then the compilations have featured more than 2,000 artists and 675
*31:32.020- 31:39.240* :  number one singles covering everything from Queen to the Vanga boys.
*31:42.600- 31:47.060* :  Robbie Williams has appeared more than anyone else 38 times in total.
*31:52.320- 31:55.560* :  And the most featured group are the X Factor winners little mix.
*32:00.500- 32:07.120* :  The series has now hit its 160th edition and sales are strong despite the advent of streaming
*32:07.120- 32:12.520* :  services like Spotify. The DJ Mark Goodyear has been the voice of the adverts for the
*32:12.520- 32:19.280* :  new albums since 1992. He says there's still a place for compilations curated by humans rather
*32:19.280- 32:24.560* :  than playlists powered by artificial intelligence. Hey I doesn't know which song was playing when you
*32:24.560- 32:30.200* :  walk down the aisle and AI hasn't had a record played at a funeral and the people who are really
*32:30.200- 32:35.760* :  good at selecting records either on a streaming service or in a compilation album like now
*32:36.060- 32:44.880* :  or on the radio they're very few and far between. If the series manages to continue it's
*32:44.880- 32:49.540* :  scheduled to release its 200th edition just in time for Christmas 2021.
