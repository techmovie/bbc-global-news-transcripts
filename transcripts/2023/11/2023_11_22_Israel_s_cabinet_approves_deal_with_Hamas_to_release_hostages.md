*00:32.000- 00:34.620* :  This is the Global News Podcast from the BBC World Service.
*00:36.760- 00:41.240* :  I'm Nick Miles, and at 14 hours GMT on Wednesday, the 22nd of November, these are our main
*00:41.240- 00:45.560* :  stories. A temporary ceasefire is imminent in the Gaza conflict.
*00:45.560- 00:52.060* :  Israel and Hamas have agreed to a release of some prisoners. The battle at the heart of artificial
*00:52.060- 00:57.860* :  intelligence three days after being sat, the founder of Open AI is back, so what's going on?
*00:58.440- 01:03.680* :  We'll look at a new report that claims China is closing and destroying mosques to curb the
*01:03.680- 01:11.200* :  practice of Islam. Also in this podcast, the Senate in France is debating a bill to compensate people
*01:11.200- 01:18.420* :  prosecuted under anti-gay laws that were repealed four decades ago. And it's kimchi day in South
*01:18.420- 01:22.800* :  Korea. How has the fermented vegetable dish become such a global phenomenon?
*01:23.500- 01:28.560* :  Koreans were making kimchi overseas, then the global pandemic has really pushed its popularity.
*01:29.300- 01:33.020* :  Nowadays food isn't just consumed for taste, but for its health benefits.
*01:37.740- 01:42.840* :  We started Gaza where the guns and missiles are still firing in the conflict with Israel,
*01:43.240- 01:48.340* :  but as we record this podcast, we've heard that a pause in fighting will start at 10 hours GMT
*01:48.340- 01:53.560* :  on Thursday. More than six weeks after the war began, a temporary ceasefire was voted through by
*01:53.560- 01:58.760* :  the Israeli cabinet in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Alongside it is an agreement to release
*01:58.760- 02:03.540* :  Palestinian prisoners in exchange for some of the people kidnapped by Hamas last month.
*02:04.300- 02:09.600* :  Itte Chen, a soldier with the Israeli Defence Forces, is believed to be one of the hostages being
*02:09.600- 02:14.600* :  held by Hamas. His father, Ruby Chen, said news of the deal had brought mixed emotions.
*02:15.560- 02:24.440* :  I am joyful for my extended new family members that will become whole again because they
*02:25.180- 02:34.480* :  are getting their loved ones back. But this is not the end. It's only the beginning of a journey
*02:34.480- 02:40.880* :  that needs to end with the release of all of the hostages. I think we need to thank
*02:41.640- 02:47.320* :  President Biden and the administration for taking such an active role in the negotiation
*02:47.360- 02:53.620* :  to make this happen. And I think we need to urge the international community to do what it can
*02:54.320- 03:01.460* :  in order to bring back home all the other hostages. Because presumably your son will not be among
*03:02.200- 03:08.680* :  the 50. Have there been communication with you about prospects for his release?
*03:09.660- 03:19.400* :  Not directly, but we do have hope that a framework that is in place now can be a sign of hope
*03:20.000- 03:27.820* :  for other deals to happen in the near future. So presumably then every release, every
*03:28.220- 03:34.160* :  moment that a truce has served, all these things which in theory should happen over the next
*03:34.160- 03:38.440* :  few days, you're going to be watching incredibly closely. Yeah, and I think there's another
*03:38.440- 03:44.040* :  component to the deal about the hostages left in Gaza that they would be able to receive
*03:44.040- 03:50.580* :  visitation from the international Red Cross, which is something so basic that has not happened
*03:50.580- 03:58.700* :  for 48 days. Have you had any indication what state your son is in? No indication whatsoever.
*03:59.480- 04:05.820* :  Again, with the lack of the international Red Cross, doctors without border, wanting to go in,
*04:05.820- 04:12.860* :  wanting to visit, which is part of the international law, which the Hamas teller's organization
*04:12.920- 04:18.200* :  has not been inviting to. We have no information about our loved ones, which if you want to think
*04:18.200- 04:23.080* :  about it for a second, do you have kids? I do, yeah. Do you know when they slept last night? I do.
*04:23.460- 04:30.400* :  Hello. Ruby Chen speaking to James Coppano. Dr Mustafa Barguiti, a Palestinian politician and
*04:30.400- 04:36.180* :  leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, gave us his reaction. I'm very happy that the
*04:36.180- 04:42.360* :  Israeli prisoners will come back safe, at least 50 of them, as well as 150 Palestinian
*04:42.360- 04:47.300* :  prisoners. These are not just any prisoners. I mean, the Palestinians are children and women.
*04:48.220- 04:53.360* :  I think what happened broke at least three of the Israeli taboos. There is no place for
*04:53.360- 04:58.500* :  ceasefire, just what they called humanitarian pose, but what we've seen here is an agreement
*04:58.500- 05:04.440* :  about a ceasefire. The Israel was talking about bringing the prisoners only by force. Now they
*05:04.440- 05:09.320* :  accepted what they didn't want to accept, which is exchange of prisoners. And they spoke all the
*05:09.320- 05:15.420* :  time about destroying Hamas. Now they're making an agreement with Hamas. Elon Levy and Israeli
*05:15.420- 05:22.080* :  government spokesman said that the deal by no means signals an end to Israel's war with Hamas.
*05:22.600- 05:28.140* :  Of course, nobody likes this, but Hamas is holding 240 hostages, including over 30 children.
*05:28.140- 05:33.300* :  We have a moral obligation to bring them home, so we're holding our noses and we're doing what
*05:33.300- 05:38.860* :  we have to do. This war has to end with the end of Hamas. Our security correspondent, Frank Gardner,
*05:38.860- 05:44.320* :  tell me more about how the prisoner and hostage swap will work. Gaza, of course, much of it is
*05:44.320- 05:50.980* :  rubble, is ruins. And these hostages have been hidden for the last six plus weeks in tunnels,
*05:50.980- 05:57.520* :  in underground basements, in bunkers, possibly some even in private homes. Hamas does not want Israel
*05:57.520- 06:03.320* :  to know where it's hidden them. They are going to be escorted out by the international committee,
*06:03.320- 06:09.000* :  the Red Cross, through the Ruffa crossing, so the southern exit of Gaza into Egypt, and from there,
*06:09.000- 06:13.440* :  they will go to, they'll be taken to Israel for a medical examination for check-up, because
*06:14.020- 06:19.980* :  they will have been in really rough conditions. Some of them will probably be quite frail and have
*06:19.980- 06:27.120* :  got even disabilities. Some of them, the danger, I think, in all of this is that there is no trust
*06:27.160- 06:35.120* :  between either side. They absolutely hate each other. And there is always the risk that a spark
*06:35.120- 06:41.040* :  could disrupt this. Hamas is not the only armed militant organization in the Gaza Strip.
*06:41.340- 06:45.780* :  You've got Palestine in the Islamic Jihad. The places are washed with Kalashnikovs and very,
*06:45.780- 06:51.260* :  very angry people, particularly young men. So there is always the risk that somebody is going to
*06:51.260- 06:56.420* :  try and take a pot shot at the hostages as they leave, or that one side or the other will blame
*06:56.420- 07:01.220* :  the other for breaking the temporary truth. So the Arabic word being used for this by Hamas is
*07:01.220- 07:07.140* :  Hudna, which means a truth. It's not quite the same as a ceasefire. And the two sides are completely
*07:07.140- 07:13.560* :  conflicting views of this. Hamas would like the pause in the fighting to be as long as possible,
*07:13.560- 07:17.960* :  preferably indefinite. Israel would like it to be as short as possible because they want to finish
*07:17.960- 07:23.420* :  off Hamas. Yeah, we heard that from Elon Levy just a few moments ago, didn't we? There is the potential
*07:23.420- 07:29.500* :  for this temporary truth to be extended a little bit if more hostages are released. But very clear,
*07:29.500- 07:35.440* :  Israel, as soon as it's got perhaps all its hostages out, will come down again very hard on Hamas.
*07:35.700- 07:42.240* :  Yeah, so the structure of the deal is that after the initial 50 Israeli hostages are released in
*07:42.240- 07:49.320* :  batches of roughly 12 a day for the next four days, assuming that goes ahead, thereafter for every
*07:49.320- 07:57.320* :  10 hostages that Hamas released from Gaza, Israel will pause for one more day. But there is a
*07:57.320- 08:02.360* :  finite number to those hostages. We don't know how many may have perished in the bombardment of Gaza
*08:03.080- 08:08.920* :  by Israel in over the last six weeks. Hamas, one Hamas official said 60 have died in that.
*08:09.380- 08:14.780* :  Both sides have said that they are going to resume hostilities. So Israel has made it very clear,
*08:14.780- 08:21.080* :  the war continues. And in Hamas' statement that it put out early this morning, their time,
*08:21.740- 08:24.580* :  it said our fingers still on the trigger. The war is not over.
*08:25.280- 08:27.140* :  Frank Gardner, our security correspondent.
*08:28.920- 08:33.020* :  To another twist now, in the tech world that we've been following on the global news podcast
*08:33.020- 08:38.540* :  over the last few days. Generative AI is the extraordinary new technology at the heart of
*08:38.540- 08:45.800* :  chatbots like chat GPT. It works by predicting what's likely to come next. But even chat GPT is
*08:45.800- 08:50.560* :  unlikely to have predicted the recent chaos at the top of one of the sector's leading companies.
*08:51.040- 08:56.760* :  Open AI. Just days after he was unexpectedly fired by the board, the founder Sam Oldman
*08:56.760- 09:02.680* :  is back as CEO. Colleagues had stood in solidarity with Mr. Altman, signing a letter
*09:02.680- 09:07.280* :  calling on the board to reverse its decision. Our technology editor Zoe Kleinman has been
*09:07.280- 09:13.640* :  trying to gauge why all this is happening. It's been an absolutely chaotic few days at one of the
*09:14.180- 09:18.920* :  West's most successful and possibly best known artificial intelligence companies.
*09:19.480- 09:26.180* :  Basically, what happened on Friday was the board of directors at Open AI suddenly fired
*09:26.180- 09:33.060* :  Sam Oldman, who was the CEO and co-founder of the firm. It said that he hadn't been consistently
*09:33.060- 09:38.760* :  candid with them in his communications, and as a result, they'd lost confidence in him.
*09:38.760- 09:44.080* :  Now, we still don't know what was at the heart of that decision, but it's a pretty saddened
*09:44.080- 09:48.260* :  and dramatic thing to do. So whatever it was, it must have been quite significant.
*09:48.920- 09:53.300* :  And then over the weekend there were these rumors that maybe he was going to come back.
*09:53.300- 09:58.600* :  We saw him going into Open AI. He put a picture of himself on social media, saying he was
*09:58.600- 10:03.340* :  wearing a guest pass lanyard for the first and last time. And everyone thought, I think I'm
*10:03.360- 10:07.620* :  going to have him back again, is this what is going on? And then on Monday, he announced his,
*10:07.620- 10:12.640* :  no, he's not coming back, he's going to Microsoft. Now, Microsoft is one of Open AI's biggest
*10:12.640- 10:18.540* :  investors. It's invested billions of dollars in the firm and in its tech. It's put the tech that
*10:18.540- 10:24.680* :  underpins chat GPT. That's the viral chatbot that belongs to Open AI. They put that into their
*10:24.680- 10:30.420* :  Microsoft 365 office apps that's used by millions of workers. So you can imagine they're probably
*10:30.420- 10:35.160* :  watching this extremely closely, thinking what on earth is going on. So on Monday, we've got Sam
*10:35.160- 10:39.300* :  Altman about to start work at Microsoft to run a team that they're going to set up for him.
*10:39.860- 10:46.040* :  And then fast forward to yesterday, we have almost all of the people who work at Open AI, that's
*10:46.040- 10:50.500* :  around seven hundred and seventy staff signing a letter saying, if Sam Altman doesn't come back,
*10:50.500- 10:57.420* :  we're going to go. And guess what, this morning, he's going back. And Zoe, why does this matter more
*10:57.420- 11:04.820* :  than any normal boardroom battle? Well, I think what matters about it is that the stakes are so high.
*11:05.280- 11:10.780* :  There are very few companies in the West with their hands directly on the wheel of this powerful
*11:10.800- 11:16.860* :  tech. It's going to influence all of our lives. And Sam Altman is one of them. And you can see,
*11:16.860- 11:21.220* :  by the way, Microsoft snapped him up so quickly that they don't want to lose him. Now,
*11:21.760- 11:27.620* :  it sounds really dramatic to say it, but lots of people think, really do think that this technology
*11:27.620- 11:32.180* :  will either save the world, you know, perhaps it will find us a solution to our climate crisis
*11:32.700- 11:38.800* :  and help us to save the world, or it could destroy us if it's misused, if it goes rogue. You
*11:38.800- 11:44.960* :  know, the stakes are that high. And so we are really looking at a kind of life and a battle playing
*11:44.960- 11:49.320* :  out. And I think that's what makes it a bit different. It's not only the billions of dollars at
*11:49.320- 11:53.720* :  stake, although there are those as well. We're literally talking about the tech that could be our future.
*11:54.280- 12:00.480* :  That was our tech editor, Zoe Kleinman. A prolonged drought in Northeastern Spain is getting worse.
*12:00.480- 12:07.840* :  Three years of barely any rain have left Catalonia's reservoirs, 80% empty. The regional government
*12:07.840- 12:12.560* :  says it's experiencing its worst drought since records began more than a century ago,
*12:13.100- 12:18.480* :  at autumn reports. It's been called a critical moment. After three years of very little rain,
*12:18.480- 12:23.260* :  the authorities are warning that fresh water might have to be brought in by boat to Barcelona,
*12:23.260- 12:29.740* :  Spain's second largest city. Water levels in some reservoirs in Catalonia are so low that once
*12:29.740- 12:35.040* :  submerged buildings like bridges and 11th century church bell tower are now reappearing.
*12:35.460- 12:40.040* :  Town halls have stopped filling public fountains and private swimming pools can't be filled.
*12:40.140- 12:45.620* :  Local officials have urged Catalonia's roughly 8 million people to limit water consumption,
*12:45.620- 12:49.720* :  and new restrictions will be imposed in the most populated areas in the region.
*12:50.220- 12:54.940* :  But with the lack of rainfall predicted to continue, officials say this may not be enough,
*12:54.940- 13:00.520* :  and they could declare a water emergency by the end of the year, meaning still tougher curbs.
*13:01.240- 13:05.940* :  Ed Horton, so as we've been hearing, in a year where extreme heat wildfires, floods,
*13:05.940- 13:08.340* :  and other natural disasters have been making headlines,
*13:09.060- 13:14.620* :  Google Trends now says there has been a dramatic rise in online searches around stress
*13:14.620- 13:19.540* :  and climate anxiety. The data was shared exclusively with BBC 100 Women.
*13:19.900- 13:23.360* :  Lucy Gilder is our reporter from that team and has been telling me more.
*13:24.100- 13:29.500* :  We ask Google to provide us with data on searches related to climate anxiety in several world
*13:29.500- 13:34.040* :  languages. The data doesn't measure the total volume of searches all over the world,
*13:34.040- 13:39.380* :  but it does give us an idea of general trends. So compared to 2017, for example,
*13:39.380- 13:43.840* :  searches related to climate anxiety in English have risen by 27 times.
*13:44.380- 13:51.340* :  In Portuguese it increased by 73 times, in Chinese by 8 and a half times, and in Arabic by a 5th.
*13:51.980- 13:56.220* :  And we also ask Google for a ranking of countries most commonly searching for queries related
*13:56.220- 14:00.900* :  to climate anxiety. And the data showed that Nordic countries had the biggest share of global
*14:00.900- 14:06.180* :  search queries related to this topic over the past five years. So Google also told us that it
*14:06.180- 14:10.540* :  noted a global increase in search queries about the future of the planet, together with queries
*14:10.540- 14:15.740* :  about the environment in the last year. So for example, how to solve climate change is one of the
*14:15.740- 14:21.140* :  trending queries about climate change in the past two years. And I think ultimately what this data
*14:21.140- 14:26.840* :  is telling us is that there appears to be growing interest in and awareness of climate anxiety
*14:26.840- 14:30.860* :  along with feelings of distress about climate change and what to do about it.
*14:31.200- 14:36.300* :  And Lucy, there's already been an academic study hasn't there specifically into women's concerns
*14:36.300- 14:42.580* :  about the global climate? Yeah, so there's a major survey done of 10,000 young people from all over
*14:42.580- 14:46.900* :  the world asking them about their emotional responses to climate change. And the findings were
*14:46.900- 14:52.980* :  really interesting. So it found that substantially more women than men reported feeling concern and
*14:52.980- 14:57.720* :  other negative emotions about climate change. Whereas men on the other hand reported feeling
*14:57.720- 15:02.740* :  more optimistic and expressed greater faith in government. And this has been backed up by other
*15:02.740- 15:08.820* :  recent surveys and studies too. An expert say this is partly because women tend to be more upfront
*15:08.860- 15:13.760* :  about discussing climate emotions than men, but also because women feel more vulnerable to some
*15:13.760- 15:18.600* :  of the impact of climate change. So there's even some research which suggests women in poorer
*15:18.600- 15:23.300* :  countries are more likely to die in climate related disasters. And this is because of various
*15:23.300- 15:28.600* :  factors such as not being able to travel to a place of safety or because of caring responsibilities.
*15:29.440- 15:34.700* :  Here's Professor Susan Clayton who co-authored a study which was based on the survey of 10,000
*15:34.700- 15:39.420* :  young people I mentioned earlier. There may be greater food insecurity because in some cultures
*15:39.420- 15:44.760* :  it's normative for men to eat first and the economic resources to be prioritized towards male
*15:44.760- 15:49.780* :  children. After an extreme weather event you frequently find increased levels of domestic violence,
*15:49.780- 15:54.780* :  pregnancy and reproduction women are often more physiologically vulnerable to climate change,
*15:54.780- 16:01.460* :  certainly high temperatures and air pollution are associated with preterm birth. All of these
*16:01.480- 16:05.940* :  things sort of put them at more physical risk as well as at more mental health risk.
*16:06.680- 16:11.080* :  So ultimately I think what this data shows is that people are being more reflective
*16:11.120- 16:16.540* :  about climate change and what it means to them and there is some evidence out there which suggests
*16:16.680- 16:21.560* :  that women may be feeling more anxious about climate change than men for various reasons.
*16:21.660- 16:29.920* :  Lucy Gilder from BBC 100 Women. A mysterious dog illness is spreading in parts of the US.
*16:29.920- 16:34.820* :  So the vets are baffled by what's causing it. More than 200 cases have been documented
*16:34.820- 16:40.820* :  in the state of Oregon since August. It is fatal in some of the dogs. Sunita Naha has more.
*16:41.620- 16:47.600* :  The infectious disease was first noticed in Portland in Oregon. Since then it's also been reported
*16:47.600- 16:54.300* :  in the states of Colorado, Illinois and New Hampshire on the East Coast. Experts however suggest
*16:54.300- 17:00.600* :  the illness could be far more widespread. Symptoms include coughing, sneezing, nasal and eye
*17:00.600- 17:07.260* :  discharge, lethargy and loss of appetite. Vets say the disease is similar to kennel cough in dogs
*17:07.260- 17:14.940* :  but lasts much longer. Dr Kurt Williams, an expert at Oregon State University, says dogs can usually
*17:14.940- 17:21.160* :  recover from a respiratory illness either on their own or with the help of antibiotics. But he
*17:21.160- 17:26.400* :  said this was not the case with this illness. There's no official count of how many dogs have been
*17:26.400- 17:32.840* :  affected and Dr Williams urged dog owners not to panic but to ensure their pets are up to date
*17:32.840- 17:38.260* :  with vaccines while vets pin down what's making the meal. Sunita Naha.
*17:40.720- 17:45.600* :  Coming up in this podcast we hear how sexual violence against women has become a deliberate
*17:45.600- 17:51.240* :  tactic in Sudan civil war. The level of dehumanisation of women in Sudan,
*17:51.560- 17:56.100* :  it reached a level where it became extremely scary and very very worrying.
*18:02.000- 18:06.740* :  Every week day morning wake up to one big story from the African continent.
*18:06.960- 18:12.460* :  Where does Africa stand in this conflict? How is Africa responding to the refugee crisis?
*18:12.460- 18:19.020* :  With me, Alan, Kassutja and Africa daily. So what's it like living in an area with Boko Harama
*18:19.760- 18:23.020* :  one story from Africa for Africa. Our story.
*18:33.160- 18:39.540* :  China is closing, destroying and repurposing mosques. That is the allegation by human rights watch
*18:39.540- 18:45.080* :  in a new report. It's part of a systematic effort to curb the practice of Islam in China,
*18:45.080- 18:50.160* :  according to the organisation. There are about 20 million Muslims in China, which is officially
*18:50.160- 18:56.280* :  atheist but says it does allow religious freedom. Our Asia Pacific Eta Miki Bristo is following
*18:56.280- 19:02.760* :  this story. Human rights watchers have been in contact with people in Gansu and Ningshia. These
*19:02.760- 19:07.840* :  are two regions in the west of China where human rights watch say that the Chinese authorities
*19:08.960- 19:14.540* :  launches attack on mosques and they've documented from these people. As you said there in the
*19:14.540- 19:22.400* :  introduction efforts to close down decommission or demolish all these mosques. In an effort what
*19:22.400- 19:28.140* :  human rights watch says is to restrict the practice of Islam but what the Chinese government might say
*19:28.680- 19:36.360* :  is to restrict the more extreme elements of Islam. That's how the Chinese justify this kind of
*19:36.360- 19:42.120* :  policy also what the Chinese are doing according to human rights watch and this has been documented
*19:42.120- 19:47.000* :  by other media outlets as well including us the BBC that the Chinese government is trying to
*19:47.000- 19:53.100* :  change the architecture of mosques by getting rid of things like domes and minarets, things which
*19:53.100- 19:58.300* :  it doesn't believe is traditional Chinese architecture. Essentially once you want to make these mosques
*19:58.300- 20:03.140* :  look more Chinese. So you say that from the government's point of view they would say what we'd
*20:03.140- 20:09.700* :  try to restrict more extremist elements of Islam. Do you think that's how many people across China see
*20:09.700- 20:16.860* :  it? Where do they stand with regards to Islam? Well it's a complicated situation and many people
*20:16.860- 20:22.280* :  in China, majority hand Chinese people, they're kind of not Muslim, they don't live among Muslim
*20:22.280- 20:28.280* :  people and there's been some skepticism growing over recent years which is partly what's driving
*20:28.280- 20:33.320* :  this policy but I think overall the Chinese government for many years has tried to put religion
*20:33.320- 20:40.140* :  in a box. It says it allows religious freedom but essentially once religious people or religious
*20:40.140- 20:46.100* :  people to be good Chinese citizens before thinking about their religion and Islam is no different to
*20:46.100- 20:52.240* :  that. Mickey Bristo. Now to India and to a story that we've been following for more than a week now
*20:52.740- 20:58.640* :  drilling has resumed near the mouth of a tunnel in India's Uttarakhand state where 41 workers
*20:58.920- 21:03.460* :  have been trapped. A correspondent Samira Hussein has more on the efforts to free them in.
*21:04.120- 21:08.800* :  It has been 11 days since a nearby landslide crushed a partially built tunnel,
*21:08.800- 21:14.980* :  trapping 41 construction workers. Rescue efforts have been hampered by poor machinery
*21:14.980- 21:20.880* :  and unstable ground. A new drill is now up and running at the mouth of the tunnel but crews are
*21:20.880- 21:26.180* :  also trying to reach the workers by drilling for additional access points. Officials on the ground
*21:26.180- 21:32.780* :  believe they will be rescued within the next 48 to 72 hours but family and friends of those stuck
*21:32.780- 21:38.320* :  inside are growing increasingly frustrated wondering why it is taking so long to get them out.
*21:38.560- 21:43.700* :  In a recently released video the men can be seen wearing hardhats, some with hive is vest
*21:43.700- 21:50.540* :  and able to respond to questions. They are being provided with cooked food, water and oxygen as they
*21:50.540- 21:57.380* :  wait to be rescued. Samira Hussein. Now a prominent women's rights organization in East Africa says
*21:57.380- 22:04.640* :  sexual violence has become a deliberate tactic in Sudan's civil war. Hala Al-Kharib who runs the
*22:04.640- 22:09.500* :  Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa was speaking to the BBC ahead of a conference
*22:09.500- 22:16.320* :  in Nairobi highlighting the impact of the conflict on women. It's the level of dehumanization of
*22:16.320- 22:22.400* :  women in Sudan. It reached a level where it got to the point where it became extremely scary
*22:22.400- 22:30.640* :  and very, very worrying. The issue of abduction for example that women has often been abducted
*22:30.640- 22:39.620* :  and has been sold in specific markets around the four. The fact that women from Masalid tribe
*22:40.140- 22:46.560* :  has been identified even in areas in Khartoum and at the peripheries of Khartoum by the RSF.
*22:46.660- 22:53.820* :  This is a new pattern as well. Overall the prevalence of sexual violence continue to increase and
*22:53.820- 23:01.760* :  reports about women and girls being violated. It's becoming part of our everyday reality. Sexual
*23:01.760- 23:10.500* :  violence from day one it was never a casualty of war. It was a war tactic and the fact that 70%
*23:10.540- 23:18.160* :  of documented cases of sexual violence are gang rape cases. So that's very telling about the
*23:18.160- 23:24.620* :  fact that there is no shame by the militiant committing such crime that it's very well intended,
*23:24.620- 23:32.260* :  it's well planned and it's a war tactic to intimidate communities and to spread fear and terror
*23:32.840- 23:38.880* :  amongst Sudanese. Those halal al-Kharib of the strategic initiative for women in the Horn of Africa.
*23:40.240- 23:44.720* :  We got a France now where the upper house of the French Parliament, the Senate, is debating a
*23:44.720- 23:50.760* :  bill to compensate people prosecuted under anti-homosexuality laws that were repealed four decades
*23:50.760- 23:55.360* :  ago. Are you at regional editor Paul Moss told us how these anti-gay laws worked?
*23:55.960- 24:00.100* :  You know the other thing is Nick that France was actually the first country in the world to
*24:00.100- 24:06.680* :  legalize homosexuality right after the French Revolution back in 1789 while they were busy storming
*24:06.680- 24:11.320* :  the Bastille and chopping the heads off unfortunate members of the royal family. They also took
*24:11.320- 24:18.280* :  time to pass what was very progressive legislation on sexual freedom. However the Nazis took over
*24:18.280- 24:23.080* :  in France during the Second World War and stalled a puppet government it was known as the Vissier regime
*24:23.080- 24:28.880* :  after the town where it was based and they did decide to crack down on homosexuality. First of all
*24:28.880- 24:35.300* :  they said you had to be 21 to have a gay relationship where it was 13 for heterosexuals and then some
*24:35.300- 24:41.440* :  offenses were punished worse if you were gay for example in decent exposure. Now the thing is these
*24:41.440- 24:47.380* :  laws were kept on after France was liberated the Vissier regime fell and they reckon yes 60,000
*24:47.380- 24:50.800* :  people were convicted they often lost their jobs too had to leave their homes.
*24:50.800- 24:56.340* :  There really was widespread suffering in a country which saw itself as sexually very enlightened
*24:57.020- 25:00.440* :  and Paul what exactly is being offered under this proposed compensation scheme?
*25:00.680- 25:06.060* :  Anyone who was affected who was convicted under these laws will get a flat fee of 10,000 euros
*25:06.060- 25:12.480* :  that's about 11,000 US dollars. Anyone sent to prison will get 150 euros for every night they
*25:12.480- 25:18.720* :  spent on pine bars. Now I should say not many people are expected to make this claim bear in
*25:18.720- 25:23.340* :  mind. First of all a lot of people have died but there's still a lot of shame around all this
*25:23.340- 25:28.560* :  even the sponsors admit the measure would really be symbolic but they say an important symbol because
*25:28.560- 25:34.860* :  if homophobia persists that's because the anti homosexual laws of the past have not been fully dealt
*25:34.860- 25:40.760* :  with. And Paul are there people still opposed to these new measures? The trouble is that anything to
*25:40.760- 25:46.840* :  do with France's wartime government is still very contentious. Many of the deeds committed by
*25:46.840- 25:52.360* :  the Vissier regime weren't even acknowledged until the past two decades. France is sometimes seen
*25:52.360- 25:57.100* :  as a country which prefers to talk about the brave resistance fighters who took on the Nazis
*25:57.100- 26:02.460* :  and not the collaborators who worked with them. So this measure is going to once again force people
*26:02.460- 26:08.520* :  to consider what French people did under the Nazis. Meanwhile some gay campaigners are not happy
*26:08.520- 26:13.500* :  because the new measure only compensates people targeted by these two laws. They say actually in the
*26:13.500- 26:18.860* :  last few decades homosexuals were targeted by other laws punished for things like moral failing
*26:18.860- 26:25.060* :  or inciting depravity. Bear in mind you know anything these days to do with sexuality I think
*26:25.060- 26:30.820* :  not just in France gets caught up in the so-called culture or so. I think this legislation could have
*26:30.960- 26:38.040* :  a rather bumpy ride. Paul Moss are Europe regional editor. Finally to South Korea which is being
*26:38.040- 26:45.200* :  marked as kimchi day. The tangy and often spicy fermented vegetables can be enjoyed as a side dish
*26:45.200- 26:50.760* :  and added to hot pots or stir-through rice even. Traditionally local communities got together to
*26:50.760- 26:56.320* :  make kimchi in bulk during November ahead of the bitter cold winter. Nowadays it's traveled
*26:56.320- 27:01.240* :  beyond Korea's borders and onto the tables and into the kitchens of people around the world.
*27:01.760- 27:06.180* :  David Kahn has been hearing from its producers and not all of them have Korean roots.
*27:11.900- 27:18.560* :  Our kimchi recipe came from this really warm-hearted Korean mother. We tried to keep that
*27:18.560- 27:26.920* :  authenticity based on the recipe that my mother had. This is Zoe Yoon, sales manager at Mr. Kimchi.
*27:27.560- 27:32.520* :  She started the business with her husband using her mother's recipe in 2013 but their history
*27:32.520- 27:39.020* :  goes a little further back. Back in 1997 I remember people coming into the house bringing their own
*27:39.020- 27:45.360* :  containers and she used to put her kimchi into the containers. Zoe's mother was one of many
*27:45.360- 27:50.820* :  Korean experts who brought their kimchi recipe overseas and from there kimchi went beyond Korean
*27:50.820- 27:56.180* :  communities. Dr. Cherine Park, principal researcher at World Institute of Kimchi in South Korea,
*28:00.740- 28:00.760* :  explains.
*28:01.620- 28:06.280* :  History of kimchi outside of Korea is closely tied to the history of Korean emigration,
*28:06.280- 28:12.660* :  going back to the 17th century. Koreans were making kimchi overseas and it was so unique that
*28:12.660- 28:17.720* :  it got attention from the locals. Then the global pandemic has really pushed its popularity.
*28:18.440- 28:22.180* :  Nowadays food isn't just consumed for taste but for its health benefits.
*28:25.080- 28:30.440* :  While studies on health benefits of kimchi are still ongoing, global kimchi consumption has grown
*28:30.440- 28:36.240* :  dramatically over the pandemic years. According to South Korean customs office, over the past five
*28:36.240- 28:42.880* :  years the export value of kimchi has gone up by 10% each year, to 140 million US dollars,
*28:42.880- 28:49.840* :  or the total weight of 41,000 tons in 2022. That is a massive jump considering the total growth
*28:49.840- 28:56.440* :  of a 10 years prior to the pandemic was under 10%. And now it's not just Koreans who are making
*28:56.440- 29:01.660* :  kimchi from scratch. Tina Benson is the owner of kimchi with everything based in London.
*29:02.300- 29:07.520* :  I lived in Japan for a while and then live in different parts of Asia. When I came back to the UK
*29:07.520- 29:13.020* :  prior to COVID, I couldn't get hold of any kimchi and it was really frustrating. It kind of really
*29:13.020- 29:18.780* :  started from that and then it progressed into a business. I've kind of kept the recipe very much
*29:18.780- 29:24.040* :  like the Korean way. In Erbidden Scotland, Arthur Sereniet director and co-founder of Crafty
*29:24.040- 29:29.860* :  Pickles took a slightly untraditional approach. We started with just making a kimchi-style sauerkraut
*29:29.860- 29:34.580* :  so all the ingredients that you normally find in a kimchi just made into a sauerkraut instead.
*29:34.600- 29:39.440* :  So more think of like a kimchi slaw a little bit. I felt like it was maybe a bit more widely
*29:39.440- 29:44.020* :  accepted by Western palate, especially up in Aberdeen Scotland where anything fermented was quite
*29:45.120- 29:51.420* :  foreign. But how do some of the Koreans feel about this non-traditional kimchi? Here stands
*29:51.420- 29:56.040* :  Sue, managing director at Korea Food, largest importer of Korean food in Europe.
*29:56.360- 30:02.140* :  There's this horrible misconception of authentic food as the only food. Well, actually as long
*30:02.140- 30:07.720* :  as it's good, it doesn't really matter to an extent. As long as it isn't Marxism as authentic,
*30:07.720- 30:12.080* :  I'm fine with it. I think people always associate kimchi with Korea.
*30:15.760- 30:19.980* :  That was Dan Sue ending that report and I have to confess at this stage, I've never had kimchi.
*30:19.980- 30:22.960* :  I must be more adventurous with my eating hemp, I suppose.
*30:24.640- 30:29.140* :  And that is all from us for now, but there will be a new edition of the Global News podcast later on.
